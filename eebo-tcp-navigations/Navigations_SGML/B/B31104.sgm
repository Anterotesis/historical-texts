<P>AMong the variety of Cruelties and Murders, which Hi&s;tory and Experience daily inform us of, this, which I now intend to relate, is none of the lea&s;t. And the &s;tory you &s;hall have <HI>ver|batim,</HI> from one of the &s;ufferers own mouth; who arrived lately in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and is now in His Maje&s;ties Fleet.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1668. the <HI>Peach-tree</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of the Burthen of about &s;ixty Tuns, <HI>Edward Dixon</HI> Ma&s;ter, came in|to the <HI>Downs</HI> bound for <HI>Guinny,</HI> intending there to take in <HI>Ne|groes,</HI> and to tran&s;port them to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and from thence to come for <HI>London,</HI> where <HI>John Watts</HI> the &s;on of <HI>John Watts,</HI> of <HI>Elham,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> Chirurgion, &s;hipt him&s;elf with the con&s;ent of <HI>Richard Watts,</HI> publick Notary of <HI>Deal;</HI> little dreading that he, being not above eighteen years old, &s;hould meet with &s;uch a calamitous accident: The Ship had not been long in the <HI>Downs,</HI> but a fair gale pre&s;enting, they &s;uddenly hoi&s;ted Sail, Gods providence &s;eeming to fill their Sails with pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s; the fir&s;t place they touched at was the Gold Coa&s;t, where they &s;taid not long, but &s;ailed to old <HI>Calabar</HI> in the Bith of <HI>Guinny.</HI> They entered a river called the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> river into <HI>Paratt</HI> I&s;land. After they had taken in their <HI>Negroes,</HI> and ready to &s;ail, their Anchor being a peek, the
<PB N="4" REF="3">Ma&s;ter calls up the Boat&s;wain and three men more, where|of the relator was one, and commands them to look out the Copper barrs that were left, and carry them on &s;hore to try if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y could &s;ell them: the Boat&s;wain with his &s;mall company de&s;ired that they might have Arms with them, not believing the report of &s;ome, that informed them they were a harmle&s;s, and innocent people: they took with them 3 Mu&s;quets and a Pi&s;tol, &amp; &s;o rowed towards the &s;hore, but not far from it unhappily our match fell into the water, &amp; the &s;hip being faln down from that narrow part of the river, nearer the Sea, quite out of our &s;ight, we were con&s;ulting what would be &s;afe&s;t for us to do: we were not willing to precipitate our own ruine, and we were al&s;o a&s;hamed to return to our &s;hip before we had di&s;patched what we were commanded to: at length the Boat&s;wain commanded the Re|lator <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hn Watts</HI> on &s;hore, to the fir&s;t hou&s;e to light our match, which we recovered out of the water, after it was extinct; which he readily obeyed: but before he was twenty Rods from the water &s;ide, he was &s;eized on by two blacks (or rather Tawny mores) and by them haled above half a mile up into the Coun|try, and thrown with great violence upon his belly, and &s;o compelled to lye till they &s;tript him; and more company coming to them, they were &s;o eager for his poor Canvas apparel, that &s;ome they tore off, others they cut off, and with that &s;everal pieces of his fle&s;h, to his intolerable pain: with the&s;e rags they made little children Aprons to cover their Privities: Linnen and Wollen being very &s;carce there. The Boat&s;wain &s;eeing this <HI>John Watts</HI> was thus carried away, was re&s;olved with his other two companions to have him again, or el&s;e to venture all their lives for him: They arm them&s;elves; but while&s;t they were con&s;ulting what to do, whether to venture on &s;hore, or not, of a &s;udden they were be&s;et with about a dozen men in &s;everal Canoes, but they valiantly maintained their boat about the &s;pace of three hours, for after two of their three Mu&s;quets were di&s;charged, they defended them&s;elves with their Oars, and Boat hooks. The Boat&s;wain received a mortal wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat; the other two adventu|red
<PB N="5" REF="3">in the River, endeavouring by &s;wimming to e&s;cape the mercile&s;s hands of cruel infidels; but the Negroes with their &s;wift Canoes &s;oon overtook them, and brought them on &s;hore to the place where the relater was. The Negroes took out the Boat&s;wain out of the &s;hips boat; and in&s;tead of endeavouring at all to pre&s;erve life which remained in him, immediately they rob'd him of it; one of them with a keen weapon cutting off his head before his companions faces; and then they prepare for their rare banquet, while he was yet reeking in his blood: they in a barbarous manner cut off pieces of fle&s;h from off his buttocks and his thighs and his arms and &s;houlders, and broi|led them on the coals, and with a great deal of impatience eagerly eat it before their faces to our great a&s;toni&s;hment. About fourteen days after one of the company fell &s;ick, and in|&s;tead of being Phy&s;icians to cure him, they were his Butchers to murther him. They &s;erved him as they did the Boat&s;wain, cut off his head, and broiled and eat up his fle&s;h and rejoyced ex|ceedingly at this rich banquet. About ten days after the third fell &s;ick, whom they &s;erved in the &s;ame manner. This was no &s;mall cau&s;e of &s;orrow to the relater: the thoughts of their inhu|mane and barbarous actions &s;ometimes &s;urrounded him with fears and &s;orrows, hourly expecting to ta&s;te of the &s;aid cruelty. Death did not &s;eem &s;o terrible to him as the violent manner of it; being left now alone in a &s;trange Country, de&s;titute of friends or acquaintance, or any thing that might keep up his Spirits: die he would fain, but not by the hand of Infidels and barbarous Mon&s;ters. But the great God that is mo&s;t compa&s;&s;io|nate in the greate&s;t extremities had pity on him, and notwith|&s;tanding the alteration of the Climate and the want of Cloaths, and the &s;trangene&s;s of his food which was only herbs, he con|tinued in good health, and had time enough to lament this direful providence. The Natives who were daily expecting another banquet, met with a di&s;appointment: either their cu|&s;toms or the over-ruling power of God would not &s;uffer them to de&s;troy him; he continuing &s;till in health. Therefore they re|&s;olve to &s;ell him: his <HI>Araunia</HI> or Ma&s;ter was pretty free to di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="4">him, which the relater was capable of, being about three years before in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where he had learned the <HI>Tata</HI> language, which is ea&s;ily attained being compre|hended in a very few words, and all the <HI>Negroes</HI> &s;peak of it. He began to di&s;cour&s;e his ma&s;ter to know the rea&s;on of their cruelty, who told him that he &s;hould re&s;t him&s;elf contented, who if he were not &s;ick, &s;hould not have his head cut off. In the Boat which in the beginning they took with them, was a Mu&s;quet &s;aved of the three which was not di&s;charged; which his ma&s;ter &s;ome time after he had been with him, brought to him to know the u&s;e of it: he endeavoured as much as he could to make him apprehend the u&s;e of it, but &s;till they pro|fe&s;t their ignorance: but they commanded and threatned him to &s;hew the u&s;e of it: The fear of his ma&s;ters di&s;plea&s;ure and their inhumanity cau&s;ed him to &s;hoot it off; but the Negroes which expected &s;ome delightful thing were fru&s;trated, and at the &s;uddain noi&s;e and fla&s;h of fire (which they very much dread) ran from him, and were greatly affrighted; but quickly after hearing no more of that noi&s;e they came up to him again, and commanded him to do the like: he told them he had not powder which was the cau&s;e of the noi&s;e; but this would not &s;atisfie the&s;e Barbarians. He not being able to an&s;wer their ex|pectation, they concluded he was not willing, they proceed to threaten him, and were about to murder him, had not his ma&s;ter re&s;cued him. Upon di&s;cour&s;e after with this <HI>Arauna</HI> or Ma&s;ter he began to under&s;tand the rea&s;on of their barbarous dealing with him and his friends, he telling him that naturally the people were civil and &s;imply hone&s;t, but if provoked, full of revenge; and that this cruelty was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome un|hand&s;ome action of carrying a Native away without their leave about a year before; they re&s;olving if any came a&s;hore they &s;hould never go off alive. He had not been above &s;even weeks in the Country, but his ma&s;ter pre&s;ented him to his King, who&s;e name was <HI>E-fn-me</HI> King of the <HI>Buckamores,</HI> who imme|diately gave him to his daughter, who&s;e name was <HI>Om-jah,</HI> and when the King went abroad he attended him al&s;o as his
<PB N="7" REF="4">Page, throughout the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above twelve miles, yet boa&s;ting extreamly of his power and &s;trength, but glorying exceedingly that he had a white to attend him, whom he employed to carry his bow and arrows at &s;everal places remote from the Sea &s;ide; the people would run away from him for fear, others would fall down and &s;eem to wor&s;hip him, and u&s;e tho&s;e actions as they do to their God. Their progre&s;s was never &s;o long but they could return home at night, but never without a hand&s;ome load of a cup of the creature. During all the time of the relaters &s;ervi|tude there, he never knew him go abroad and come home &s;ober. They drink of the be&s;t Palm Wine, and another &s;ort of &s;trong liquor, called <HI>Penrore.</HI> The relater quickly knew how to hu|mour this profound Prince, and if any of the Natives abu&s;ed him, upon his complaint he had redre&s;s, as once by &s;triving with a Negroe his Arm was broke, which by providence more than skill was &s;et again. After &s;ome months, the King of <HI>Ca-la-nanch</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>E-fn-man-cha,</HI> hearing of this beautiful white, courted his neighbour Prince, that he would &s;ell him to him; at length they &s;truck a bargain, and the relater was &s;old for a Cow and a Goat; this King was a very &s;ober and moderate per&s;on, free from treacheries and mi&s;chiefs, that the other was &s;ubject unto; and he would often di&s;cour&s;e the Relater, and ask him of his King and Country, and if his Kingdomes and Dominions were as big as his, which were not above twenty five miles in length and fifteen in breadth. He told him as much as his under&s;tanding and years made him capable of, keeping &s;till in the bounds of mo|de&s;ty, and yet relating as much as po&s;&s;ible to the honour and dignity of his Sovereign; fir&s;t informing him of the greatne&s;s of one of his Kingdomes, the &s;everal Shires and Counties it contained, with number of its Cities and Towns and Ca&s;tles, and the &s;trength of each, the infinite inhabitants, and valour of his Subjects. One of the&s;e Kingdomes was enough to amaze &s;ufficiently this petty Governour, that he need not to mention any more of his Maje&s;ties Glory and Dignity. It put him into
<PB N="8" REF="5">&s;uch a profound con&s;ternation, that he re&s;olved to find out &s;ome way to tender his re&s;pects to this mighty Prince, and no way could he find &s;o convenient, as to tell the Relater, that if he could find but a pa&s;&s;age, he would let him go to <HI>England,</HI> to tell his Maje&s;ty of the great favour and re&s;pect he had for him. This did not a little rejoyce our Engli&s;h man. Withal the King told him, that he would &s;end him a Pre&s;ent, which &s;hould be two Cabareets or Goats, which they do value at a very high rate; the King having not above 16 or 18. He tells the King, that the King of <HI>England</HI> had many thou&s;ands of his &s;ubjects, that were under the degree of Gentlemen, which had a thou|&s;and of Sheep apiece; the fle&s;h of which, they valued at a very much higher rate than Goats. Though our Engli&s;h man lived very hand&s;omely with this <HI>E-fn-man-cha</HI> King of the <HI>Ca|la-nanch,</HI> yet his de&s;ires and his hopes were &s;till for his Native Countrey: at length he obtained a promi&s;e from his King, that the fir&s;t Engli&s;h &s;hip that came into the Road, &s;hould have li|berty to relea&s;e or purcha&s;e him; this very much rejoiced his heart: now he thought every day a year, till he could hear of, or &s;ee &s;ome Engli&s;h Ship arrived. Many times when he was a|lone, his heart would be oppre&s;t with &s;ighs and &s;obbings, when he thought of his Relations, and the comfortable &s;ociety that they had together; that it &s;hould be his unhappy fate to be ca|ptivated amon&s;t barbarous Infidels. Oftentimes did he walk down to the Sea-&s;ide, &s;ometimes with hopes, &s;ometimes with fear, earne&s;tly expecting the wind of Gods Providence to blow in &s;ome Engli&s;h Ship thither: his often recour&s;e to the Sea-&s;ide was di&s;cerned by one <HI>Ja-ga</HI> a Wizard, &amp; the chiefe&s;t in three or four Kingdoms thereabouts; they are per&s;ons that the Natives give very much credit to, and on any difficult occa&s;ion run to them for &s;atisfaction. That famous Delphean Oracle was ne|ver had in greater adoration, than the prophetical &s;peeches of the&s;e Mori&s;h Wizards. Though they have infinite numbers of them in every place, yet this <HI>Ja-ga</HI> had the mo&s;t renown among&s;t them; and one day he comes to him, and very kindly ask'd him, why he &s;o very often frequented that place; he
<PB N="9" REF="5">told him, to &s;ee if he could di&s;cover any Engli&s;h Ve&s;&s;el to come in there; but he being not unacquainted with his great fame, askt him when he did believe there would one come in; not that he was willing to give credit to any of their divinations, but &s;up|po&s;ing that he thereby &s;hould plea&s;e him and an&s;wer his expectation. <HI>Ja-ga</HI> immediately told him that the fifteenth day after an Engli&s;h Ship &s;hould come into the Road. Then he askt him whether that &s;hip &s;hould carry him away. To this he an&s;wered doubtfully, but told him that he &s;hould be offered to the Ma&s;ter of the Ship, and if they could not a|gree, but that he &s;hould come to &s;hoar again, he &s;hould not be &s;old, and that in a very &s;hort time after he &s;hould dye for grief. The&s;e fifteen days &s;eem'd very long and tedious; many a look did he ca&s;t on the Sea with an aking heart: the fourteenth day he went to the highe&s;t hill there-about, but to no purpo&s;e, for he could di&s;cover no &s;hip: next morning he went again two or three times, but &s;aw none: about two or three hours after came running into <HI>E-fn-man-cha,</HI> &s;ome of the Mores, and told him there was a Canoe coming, &s;o they called our &s;hips, at which our Engli&s;h man heartily rejoyced, hoping then to be relea&s;t forthwith, yet dur&s;t not &s;hew his Joy for fear of puni&s;h|ment or of death; for though he lived better now than with his fir&s;t Ma&s;ter, yet his &s;ervice was far wor&s;e than the &s;laves in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and their diet wor&s;e than Dogs meat; therefore had he cau&s;e enough of inward joy; the &s;hip came immedi|ately in, and he hies away pre&s;ently to <HI>Ja-ga,</HI> to know if it were an Engli&s;h &s;hip, who re&s;olved him that it was; it happe|ned to be the St. <HI>Maloes</HI> Merchant, Captain <HI>Royden</HI> Comman|der, who ha&s;tened to di&s;patch his bu&s;ine&s;s, took in his Ne|groes, and was ready to &s;ail, and our Engli&s;h man heard never a word what &s;hould become of him, the King never offering to &s;ell him; this put him on a re&s;olution to endeavour to make an e|e&s;cape, and to that end had prepared a piece of Timber which he had drawn near the water &s;ide, on which he intended to paddle to the &s;hip, which then lay about a league from the &s;hore. Ju&s;t by the Sea &s;ide, as he was about to launch his little
<PB N="10" REF="6">floating &s;tick, he e&s;pied a great Aligator, which will devour a man at a mouthful; this made him alter his re&s;olution, and re&s;olve rather to live with inhumane infidels, than to throw him&s;elf into &s;o imminent a danger, which would have been little le&s;s than &s;elf-murther. But the next day, which I may call a day of <HI>Jubile,</HI> Almighty God opened the heart of the King to let the poor Engli&s;h man go: he &s;ent him in a Canoe, plac'd between a Negroes legs, with &s;ome others to guide this &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, for fear he &s;hould leap over-board, and &s;wim to the &s;hip. At a di&s;tance from the &s;hip he hailed her in the En|gli&s;h Tongue, which was no &s;mall cau&s;e of admiration to tho&s;e on board to hear an Engli&s;h Tongue out of their Canoes: the Negroes gave him leave to &s;tand up and &s;hew him&s;elf to the Captain, to whom he gave an account how four were left there, and only he pre&s;erved. It was a pretty while before they could &s;trike a bargain, though the Captain was re&s;olved not to leave him behind. Several times the Negroes padled a|way with their Canoe, re&s;olving not to part with him; but what with his entreaties and promi&s;es he per&s;waded them to the &s;hip again, and they delivered him on board for forty five Copper Bars and Iron Bars, each Copper Bar being about the bigne&s;s of a Youths little finger, the Iron Bars a little bigger. Now were his joys compleated, he thought him&s;elf, as it were caught up into the third heavens; he could hardly per&s;wade him&s;elf but it was a Dream or Vi&s;ion, and that he did not re|ally &s;ee Engli&s;h faces or embrace Engli&s;h bodies. It was &s;ome time before he could throw him&s;elf at the Captains feet, and acknowledge his infinite cau&s;e of joy in him&s;elf, and thankful|ne&s;s to him for his deliverance from &s;uch a &s;evere Captivity; that he that lately was a &s;lave to Infidels, that wor&s;hip they know not what, &s;hould now &s;ee the faces of Chri&s;tians, and joyn with them in wor&s;hiping the true God; and to him fir&s;t he offered up the &s;acrifice of hearty thank&s;giving, that had &s;ent his Angel to redeem him from &s;o cruel a bondage. When he came on board, his hair was very long, and his skin tawny (<HI>Ma|latto</HI> like) having gone naked all the time he was there, and fre|quently
<PB N="11" REF="6">anointing him&s;elf with palm Oyl, he looked like a Tawny-More; but immediately the Sea-men aboard with Chri|&s;tian-like hearts apparelled him. The Ma&s;ter commanded to hoi&s;e &s;ail, and having a fair wind, they &s;ailed to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where Captain <HI>Royden</HI> was to tarry &s;ome time; but the Relator earne&s;tly de&s;iring to go to his Native Countrey, and his relations, got pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Downs,</HI> in the <HI>Catharine</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>South</HI> Commander, which through Gods goodne&s;s in a few weeks arrived in the <HI>Downs,</HI> where the Relater was put on &s;hore, to his Unkle, Mr. <HI>Richard Watts</HI> of <HI>Deal,</HI> his great joy and &s;atisfaction, who took this relation from his own mouth.</P>

<P>BOws, Arrows, and Swords, they make of a piece of Iron they &s;teal from the Engli&s;h, and beat out with &s;tones, which they neatly engrave: al&s;o they have a lance, which is al&s;o tipt at end with a piece of Iron, and cut and engraved with flints, as they do their Swords: very few of them have either lance or &s;word, many of them have &s;words of Iron-Wood, &s;o called there. Their Bow is about four foot long: their Arrows about two foot and a quarter: their lance is about five foot long. The&s;e are the Weapons they fight with, and with them they do much mi&s;chief.</P>

<P>THey have no particular place of Wor&s;hip, neither do they congregate them&s;elves, nor are there Mini&s;ters, or in the lea&s;t a talk of their God (but of fear of being beat by him) but like bea&s;ts ri&s;e out of their little lodgings; eat, drink, and take their plea&s;ures, and at night &s;leep again. He hath often|times heard them &s;ay, their God (which is the Devil) often|times appears to them in the likene&s;s of a man, about two foot and a half high, as black as they are, whom they call <HI>Ajah,</HI> (which is very &s;trange that the Devil &s;hould give him&s;elf &s;uch a name, which is compounded of <HI>A</HI> and <HI>Jah,</HI> which is one of the names of God, as in <HI>Exodus: Jah</HI> is my name, &s;o <HI>Ajah</HI> be|ing joined together, is as much as if the Devil &s;hould call him|&s;elf without God, or again&s;t God. But for that the learned will tell you at ea&s;e, that with much &s;tudy cannot be re&s;olved by my pen.) When any of them are &s;ick, they go to the picture of their <HI>Ajah,</HI> and &s;peak to it, then &s;uddenly after he appears, as at

If the &s;ick man re|cover not, and if he be rich, they take &s;everal of his &s;laves before his face and be-head them, and throw their blood on their Ma|&s;ter.

<HEAD>If they dye.</HEAD>
<P>If ordinary people be &s;ick and like to dye, they cut off their heads, and keep them above ground five days. But if a rich man be &s;ick, they cut not off his head, but let him die naturally. And when five days are expired, they bury him with his Cop|per bars about his neck, wa&s;te, arms, and legs, as they u&s;ually go, burying with him every &s;ort of that hou&s;ehold-&s;tuff they have, as a &s;tool, an earthen Pot, a Calaba&s;h, a Goard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with him &s;ome of his &s;ervants heads, &s;ometimes three or four, &s;ometimes ten or twelve; and this is a credit for the Ma&s;ter, and an honour to the &s;ervant.
