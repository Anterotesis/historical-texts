<P>Concerning the Marriage of the Emperour: Fir&s;t, his Imperiall Maie&s;tie and the Empre&s;&s;e going vnto the Church of the Franci&s;cane Fryers, they were accompanied by diuers Am|ba&s;&s;adors, be&s;ides the Nuncio of the Pope, and diuers Lords and Ladies walking all in very good order: After many of them followed the Mar&s;hall, who carried the Sword before the Em|perour, who being arrayed in in an Imperiall ha|bit, was adorned with his Crowne, and had his Scepter in his right hand, and the Globe of the Empire in his left. Before the Empre&s;&s;e, who followed them clo&s;e, went the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Hun|garie,</HI> with the Crowne of the &s;aid Kingdome, the Lord <HI>E&s;terha&s;ie</HI> with the Scepter, the Lord <HI>Set&s;y</HI> with the Globe of the Kingdome afore|&s;aid, be&s;ides a Bi&s;hop, who carryed her Maie&s;ties Crowne: The Ladies of the Court, and the Maids of Honour, being all richly attyred,
<PB N="15" REF="12">and adorned with precious Stones, came imme|diately after.</P>
<P>Secondly, as &s;oone as both Maie&s;ties were en|tred into the Church, they kneeled downe be|fore the high or principall Altar. Whereupon the Arch-bi&s;hop holding a Booke before his Maie&s;tie, hee continued his Prayers for a while, being &s;till adorned with his Habite, Crowne, Scepter, and Globe afore&s;aid. And from thence he went to the Quire (where a Seat was prepared for him) kneeling there likewi&s;e downe. But the Empre&s;&s;e remayned &s;till kneeling vpon the fir&s;t place; where, at the beginning of the Seruice, were diuer&s;e Ceremonies v&s;ed, and Mu&s;icke heard: afterwards the Epi&s;tle being read, the great Letanie was &s;ung; during which, &s;hee lay with her face downewards vpon two pillowes of Cloth of Gold, before the Altar afore&s;aid. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk">e ended, the Lord Arch-bi&s;hop anoynted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">er before &s;hee ro&s;e, betwixt her elbow and hand, as likewi&s;e her cheekes.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Ceremonies being fini&s;hed, the Empre&s;&s;e went away, being conducted by her Steward, the Lord of <HI>Didrich&s;tain,</HI> be&s;ides o|ther Lords, as likewi&s;e her &s;hee Steward, the Counte&s;&s;e of <HI>Portia,</HI> and diuer&s;e Ladies of her Chamber: But &s;hee came pre&s;ently backe to the Altar, arrayed in Cloth of Siluer, being adorned al&s;o with a rich Chaine and a Medall. Before her went the Lord <HI>Set&s;y,</HI> with the Globe of the King|dome of <HI>Hungarie;</HI> the Lord <HI>E&s;terha&s;ie</HI> with the
<PB N="16" REF="13">Scepter, and the <HI>Palatine</HI> afore&s;aid with the <HI>Hun|garian</HI> Crowne: &s;hee followed them with her owne Crowne, being &s;et vpon her head by ano|ther <HI>Hungarian</HI> Bi&s;hop, which is very richly ador|ned with Pearles and precious Stones, and very artificially made. Afterwards, the Lord <HI>E&s;terha&s;ie</HI> gaue the Archbi&s;hop the Scepter, the Lord <HI>Set&s;y</HI> the Globe, the <HI>Palatine</HI> the Crowne; and he gaue her Maie&s;tie the Scepter in her left hand, the Globe in the right, and the Crowne hee &s;et vpon her right &s;houlder, and during the time that the Angelicall Salutation was &s;ung, &s;hee kept the &s;ame: afterwards they were taken from her a|gaine, and layd vpon the Altar; whereupon was &s;ung <HI>Te Deum laudamus,</HI> and the Empre&s;&s;e hauing her owne Crowne vpon her head, and the <HI>Hun|garian</HI> Scepter in her right hand, and the Globe in her left, was conducted to her ordinarie Seat in the middle of the Quire, where a <HI>Theatrum</HI> was erected, and adorned with rich Tapi&s;trie and Hangings of Cloth of Gold. At the left hand his Maie&s;tie continuing kneeling in his prayers, without changing his Imperiall habite, the Mar&s;hall afore&s;aid kept his Sword, and two other Lords the Globe of the Empire, and the Scepter. The Ceremonies, be&s;ides the v&s;uall Rites and Cu&s;tomes fini&s;hed, the Emperour and Empre&s;&s;e were conducted backe to the Pallace by the Lords afore&s;aid, both Spirituall and Tem|porall, as well <HI>Hungarian</HI> as <HI>German,</HI> be&s;ides the Ladies, their Maie&s;ties being both &s;till attyred in
<PB N="17" REF="13">their habites, and their traine going in good or|der, as before: where there was prepared a &s;tate|ly Banquet for all the&s;e Gue&s;ts, as well <HI>Hungar iuns</HI> as <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>During the Coronation, a Citizen, who clombe vpon the Cro&s;&s;e of the Steeple of the Church afore&s;aid, flouri&s;hed an En&s;igne, &s;tan|ding vpon the &s;ame without falling, and the &s;ame was likewi&s;e afterwards done by diuers <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Hungarians;</HI> and among&s;t them, a <HI>German</HI> Souldier put all his clothes from his backe vnto his &s;hirt, being vpon the &s;ame.</P>
