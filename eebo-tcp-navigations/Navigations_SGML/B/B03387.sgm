<P>ON the Sixth of this Month Count <HI>Ca&s;telli,</HI> General of Batalia, and Ba|ron <HI>Smidberg,</HI> having been di&s;patch'd by Prince <HI>Lowis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> to the Emperour, brought the following Particulars of a great Victory gain'd over the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army, which he commands in <HI>Servia,</HI> came on the 21&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to <HI>Konighfelt,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;teepne&s;s and difficulty of the Mountains, which are interlac'd with Moora&s;&s;es, &s;o as that they were become impa&s;&s;able by the continual Rains, with which its march had been extreamly incommoded, from the time it had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Morava,</HI> for the going in pur&s;uit of the <HI>Sera&s;quier,</HI> who was retreating towards <HI>Ni&s;&s;a.</HI> That the &s;ame day he came in view of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, which was drawn up in Battle-array upon Hills. That on the 22d the <HI>Sera&s;quier</HI> retired towards <HI>Jagodina,</HI> behind the River <HI>Morava,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Danube,</HI> where he remain'd Encamp'd till the 26th, for the a&s;&s;embling all his numerous Forces, con&s;i&s;ting of Sixty Thou&s;and Men, according to the Report of Spies and De&s;ertets. That the Prince had endeavoured to pa&s;s that River, &s;o to attack the <HI>Turks:</HI> But the ill ways having hinder'd the expeditious bringing up of the Boats, and other ne|ce&s;&s;ary Materials for making a Bridge, he had made &s;emblance of retreating, that &s;o by this &s;eint he might draw the <HI>Sera&s;quier</HI> out of the advantagious Po&s;ts he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and come to &s;ome great Action. After this, on the 29th of the &s;ame Month, being St. <HI>John's</HI> Day; which the <HI>Turks</HI> hold to be happy and fortunat to their Arms, that Prince being return'd with the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army to the Neighbourhood of <HI>Pota&s;chin,</HI> or <HI>Bara&s;chin,</HI> caus'd his Army to be Mar|&s;hall'd in Battel-array, on the Banks of the <HI>Morava.</HI> The Night before, the Bridge-ma&s;ter cau&s;'d two Bridges to be laid over that River, with &s;o much Diligence, that to Reward his Pains and Labours, that Prince had given him a Gratification of a Thou&s;and <HI>Florins.</HI> Ten Thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> that had pa&s;&s;'d that River over their own Bridges, with a de&s;ign to Charge our Reer, were Encounter'd by one of our Detachments that was &s;ent to view them; and after a &s;light Skirmi&s;h, it returned to joyn our Camp, with a <HI>Chiaux</HI> and four <HI>Tartars</HI> they had taken Pri&s;oners, being not &s;trong e|nough
<PB N="2" REF="2"> any longer to make head again&s;t them with advantage. The 10000 <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeing our Party retreat, pur&s;ued it into the very &s;ight of our Camp, whence great Detachments of Cavalry and Dragoons, were made to drive them back; but while they were engag'd, the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> caus'd part of his Foot to pa&s;s to the other &s;ide of the <HI>Morava,</HI> with de&s;ign to Attack the main Body of the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;ince they expre&s;s'd &s;o much eagerne&s;s to Fight upon a be|lief, it was out of fear that our Army retired: we had no &s;ooner three Bat|talions, and five Squadrons on the other &s;ide, but that the <HI>Oltomans</HI> came to Charge them mo&s;t furiou&s;ly with their <HI>Drawn-Sabres;</HI> but having met our <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Term in Fortification, &s;ignifying Po&s;ts Armed with Spikes.</NOTE> <HI>Chevaux de Frize,</HI> who &s;top'd their Cavalry, the <HI>Imperialists</HI> kill'd a great number of them in this Action, and they were forc'd to fall back into the <HI>De|filees,</HI> where they &s;tood our coming up: Then it was, that our Cavalry that had been Detatched again&s;t 10000 <HI>Turks,</HI> who would have Charg'd our Reer, repul&s;'d them, and forc'd them to repa&s;s the <HI>Morava</HI> as fa&s;t as they could. Our whole Army being pa&s;s'd, the <HI>Turks</HI> reinforc'd them&s;elves in the <HI>Defilees,</HI> they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before the Plain which they covered, and which had a Wood on one &s;ide, and Hills on the other. The Entrance into the Plain, into which the <HI>Defilees</HI> led, was interlac'd with &s;everal <HI>Moora&s;&s;es,</HI> which rendred the Acce&s;s to it very difficult. The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> cau&s;ed the Regiments of <HI>Seraw</HI> and <HI>Ki&s;&s;el,</HI> who were in the Van of the Army, to drive the Enemies from their <HI>De|filees.</HI> There needed no more than to give our Men to under&s;tand that they mu&s;t pur&s;ue the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> and not let the occa&s;ion, they had, &s;lip of gain|ing a great Victory,, to &s;et the Hor&s;e and Foot upon pa&s;&s;ing a-cro&s;s tho&s;e <HI>Moo|ra&s;les</HI> in the Water up to the Middle, nay up to their very Shoulders, holding up their Arms and Weapons, to hinder them from being wet; and according as they pa&s;s'd, they formed them&s;elves into Squadrons and Battalions, until that at length, all being pa&s;s'd, and the Battel drawn up in Battel-array, our Troops march'd directly upon the Enemy, who &s;tood our coming up upon a Hill; and they attack'd the In&s;idels with &s;o much Courage and Fiercene&s;s, that they forc'd their Entrenchments, notwith&s;tanding their Oppo&s;ition; and after having kill'd a va&s;t Number, forc'd them to betake them&s;elves to Flight.</P>
<P>By this Victory we remain'd Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Turks</HI> Camp, of all their Bag|gage, Tents, Carriages, Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, as al&s;o of a hundred and five Pieces of Cannon, of &s;everal Mortar-pieces, of a va&s;t number of Colours and Standards, of the Great Hor&s;es Tail (which is the <HI>Turks</HI> Great Standard), and abundance of other Riches, in&s;omuch that the Soldiers rejoice in a World of Booty. They Attack'd them with that vigor, that after a Fight of about 4 hours, there were 50000 Routed, 20000 killed, and 6000 taken Pri&s;oners. Count <HI>Ca&s;telli</HI> and Baron <HI>Smidbergh,</HI> who brought the fir&s;t Account, departed from the Camp immediatly after this great Victory, which we hope to be able &s;hortly to give a more individual Account of.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Lowis,</HI> after this happy Succe&s;s, which co&s;t not the Imperiali&s;ts 1000 Men, continued his March towards <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> to de&s;troy the Enemies great Mega|zines there.</P>
