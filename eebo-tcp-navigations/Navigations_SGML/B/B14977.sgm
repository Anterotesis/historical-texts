<P>_VPon the tiding which the Po&s;t of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> brought here of the Treatie which is now in France apppointed; there were here diuers &s;peeches, rumours, and con|iectures &s;pread abroad of the de&s;ignes of the King of <HI>France;</HI> and the order which was alrea|dy giuen before to &s;ome Colonels to march towards <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> was al&s;o againe renued by the Imperiall Councell. And the Colonell <HI>Schauwenberg</HI> who lay with his Regiment at <HI>Eger</HI> vpon the Frontiers of <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> marcht pre&s;ently with it towards <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and there were al&s;o yet two other Regiments, and &s;ome hor&s;e appointed to follow him with all &s;peed they could make.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> hauing conferred at <HI>No|renberg,</HI> with the Electors of <HI>Mentz</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">they &s;ent the Emperour word of the re&s;olution by them taken; namely, that they de&s;ired that a meeting might be appointed, at which the Electors might one|ly appeare for to treat about &s;ome particular points concerning them&s;elues, as to prouide that the Empe|rour might not any more hereafter di&s;po&s;e of the E|&s;tates and Lands of any Elector, without the con&s;ent of the vvhole Colledge: And to con&s;ult al&s;o, and to conclude, who &s;hall haue right to &s;ucceede the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> after his decea&s;e in the Electorate, intending to exclude the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> and his i&s;&s;ue for euer.</P>
<P>The Generall meeting which was appointed in <HI>Morauia</HI> is now ended, and the States of the Land haue agreed to pay within the &s;pace of &s;ixe moneths 250000 Florins (each of them is worth three &s;hillings Sterling) vpon condition that they of the Countrie &s;hall haue an ab&s;olute pardon, and bee di&s;charged of the Souldiers vvhich are in it.</P>
<P>Although the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI> hath againe made an inua&s;ion vpon our frontiers, there are neuerthele&s;&s;e yet many that thinke the Great Seigneur will breake the Peace betwixt the Emperour and him.</P>
<P>The Co&s;&s;acks haue not as yet receiued the money which is promi&s;ed vnto them for a part of their pay, and are therefore continuing their exce&s;&s;es and in&s;o|lencies.</P>

<P>It continueth &s;till, that the Turkes hauing made them&s;elues very &s;trong about <HI>Offen,</HI> inuaded <HI>Lowentz,</HI> and did there great hurt both by fire and &s;word. There is now great doubt made of the Peace betwixt The Emperor and the Great Seigneur: for <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> &s;ent hither an Amba&s;&s;ador with a Letter writ|ten in the name of the Great Seigneur to him <HI>(Beth|lem Gabor)</HI> by which he de&s;ired to know whether, if occa&s;ion &s;hould be offered, hee would take part with him, or the Emperor. Whereupon <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;iluania,</HI> de&s;ireth to know of the Emperor how and in what manner he may a&s;&s;ure his owne E&s;tate, and in what fa&s;hion he will protect him, what ayd, and how &s;oone he will bee ready to &s;end it vnto him: and prote&s;ted moreouer, that in ca&s;e of deniall of &s;uch ayd as is required, the Emperor &s;hould haue no rea&s;on to blame him, if to pre&s;erue his lands and &s;ubiects he turned to the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Tartars haue done great hurt in <HI>Polen,</HI> and de|feated many Polonians: and the King of <HI>Polen</HI> hath &s;ent for the Co&s;&s;ackes which are in the&s;e lands, but they will not depart before they be payd. Whereby it appeareth, that it is not true that (as &s;ome repor|ted) the Polonians &s;hould haue defeated the Tartars which made the late inua&s;ion in <HI>Polonia.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>From Vienna Aug. <HI>14.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Bauaria</HI> hauing made at <HI>Nurenberg</HI> his oath (as an Elector) before the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4">who is Chancelor of the Empire, the Land-graue of <HI>Darm&s;tadt</HI> was pre&s;ently &s;ent to the Elector of <HI>Bran|denberg,</HI> for to learne his mind concerning the re&s;olu|tions that haue beene taken at <HI>Schlen&s;ingen,</HI> which are thought to agree with them of the Elector of <HI>Saxony.</HI> And it is now almo&s;t generally beleeued that the en|deauors which <HI>Mon&s;eur Mare&s;cot</HI> hath v&s;ed in <HI>Ger|many,</HI> for there e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;eueral Princes of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> are not likely to take any good effect.</P>
<P>It is here al&s;o euen now rumored, that the Regi|ment of the Colonell <HI>Schauwenbach</HI> is to bee &s;taid at the in&s;tance of the Archduke <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> who &s;tands at this time in greater feare of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the im|periall Souldiers, then of the threatnings of the French. He re&s;igned lately his Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Pa&s;|&s;aw</HI> in the fauor of his Brother the Archduke <HI>Charles,</HI> who hath receiued the Deeds of it: and it is held for certaine, that he him&s;elfe is to marry with the widow of the late Duke of <HI>Vrbin.</HI></P>
<P>The di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of the Co&s;&s;acks is not &s;o much de|ferred for want of money, as by rea&s;on of the immi|nent troubles in the Empire, and the other neighbou|ring lands. And the Turks euen them&s;elues haue made lately an inua&s;ion as farre as <HI>Lowentz.</HI> And although <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> prote&s;teth that hee hath had no hand in the late &s;tirrings of the Turkes, hauing but few dayes agoe &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to &s;uch effect to the Emperor, who is yet here, and hath promi&s;ed in his name, that he on his &s;ide will keepe the Treaty of a|greement, and de&s;ires that the Emperor wil &s;hew him this fauour, that he may &s;end &s;ome per&s;ons into the
<PB N="5" REF="4">Empire to find out a Lady or Prince&s;&s;e fit to match with him.

<P>And it is here rumored, that if the Peace bee once broken with <HI>France,</HI> that 8000 or 10000 Co&s;&s;acks &s;hall bee &s;ent thitherwards to wa&s;te and &s;poile the Country.</P>

<P>The tiding is confirmed againe of the great war|like preparations which <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> hath made, ha|uing mu&s;tred after the generall Meeting of <HI>Hungary</HI> was ended 30000 men, many Turkes and Tartars be|ing among&s;t them, and all furni&s;hed with their armes, and ready to march: He hath likewi&s;e 12 great pee|ces of bra&s;&s;e, be&s;ides great &s;tore of other ordnance, and (as they &s;ay) giues it out that the Emperor hath not kept the Agreement made betwixt them, and that he is therefore not bound to keepe it any longer. The Count of <HI>Thurne</HI> gathereth likewi&s;e a &s;trong army, with intention to come into <HI>Sile&s;ia.</HI> But his Imperi|all Maie&s;tie hauing gotten notice of his de&s;igne, hath prouided all the frontier places and pa&s;&s;ages with all
<PB N="6" REF="5">manner of nece&s;&s;aries to hinder his intended en|terpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The Co&s;&s;acks which were going homeward, are againe called backe by a Po&s;te, and there are yet &s;ome 12000 other that were vpon the Frontiers of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> lately taken in the Emperors &s;eruice to re&s;i&s;t <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI></P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Monte-Negro</HI> hath likewi&s;e gotten order againe to goe againe with his Regiments into <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>They goe here daily on with their pretended re|formation, and many of the principall Citizens haue already gotten warning that they mu&s;t within the &s;pace of three moneths either for&s;ake the City, or turne to the Catholicke Romane Religion: where|vpon many of them haue &s;ent already out of this City a great part of their be&s;t moueables. There are like|wi&s;e many Schooles of the Prote&s;tants &s;hut.

<P>The Regiments of the Dukes of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Hol|&s;tein</HI> are to be mu&s;tred, and &s;hall thereupon receiue &s;ix moneths of their pay.</P>
<P>His Imperiall Maie&s;ty hath lately giuen order for the leauying of 4000 hor&s;e, which are to goe into <HI>Germany,</HI> for feare of Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> and his &s;up|porters. We haue here tidings that the Lord <HI>Curtz</HI> the Emperours Amba&s;&s;ador is are&s;ted by the Tur|ki&s;h

<P>The Lord of <HI>Lambach</HI> writ with a Letter dated at <HI>Cremitz</HI> the 11 of this moneth: That three Ba&s;haws, &amp; diuers other of the chiefe&s;t Turks were with great forces come ouer the Riuer of Donaw, and that they hauing done great hurt by robbing and pillaging, had moreouer taken &s;ome twenty Villages which are ly|ing about the townes which &s;tand on the Hils of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and de&s;ire likewi&s;e to haue all the other, and &s;eeme to haue taken a re&s;olution to &s;urpri&s;e <HI>New|hen&s;el,</HI> from whence they haue already taken great &s;tore of bea&s;ts and cattell that was in the neighbou|ring Villages. And &s;eeing that <HI>Bethlem Gaber</HI> hath great corre&s;pondencie with the Turkes, there are many townes which the Emperour kept yet on the Mountaines of <HI>Hungary,</HI> that yeelded to <HI>Bethlem Gabor.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the Lord of <HI>Lambach</HI> hath written to the Emperor, de&s;iring him to &s;end with all &s;peed that be made, great aide both of men and all other maner of proui&s;ion.</P>
<P>Although there was lately a re&s;olution taken to di&s;mi&s;&s;e the Co&s;&s;ackes vpon the receiuing of the pay|ment which is to be made vnto them, there is now giuen order that they &s;hall not depart &s;eeing the Em|perour &s;tandeth now in need of their &s;eruice.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Monte-Negro</HI> is within the &s;pace of few dayes to goe towards <HI>Olmits</HI> in <HI>Moravia,</HI> to ga|ther

<HEAD>From Prage, Augu&s;t <HI>10.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Within the &s;pace of this moneth was there a Bur|ger of this City, who fired on purpo&s;e a hou&s;e in the new City of <HI>Prage,</HI> and threw him&s;elfe thereupon in|to the riuer of Moldaw. And happening the 4 of this moneth that &s;ome Fi&s;her-men tooke his body, the Magi&s;trate cau&s;ed it to be quartered by the hangman, who buried it afterwards.</P>
<P>This tenth day of Augu&s;t got the Burgers of the aforementioned new City, warning, or rather in&s;i|nuation that they had lo&s;t their right of Burger&s;hip, which they gat &s;ome &s;ixe yeares agoe, &s;eeing they would not embrace the Catholike Romane religion, and that the day of Saint <HI>Iames,</HI> which was prefixed vnto them, was already pa&s;t. Whereupon their traf|fickes and trades are forbidden to them all, and their &s;hops &s;hut vp, except fiue, the ma&s;ters of them being turned to the Romane Religion.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e three Cities of <HI>Prage</HI> are the Burgers now daily vrged by the Imperiall Commi&s;&s;ioners to pay &s;uch moneyes are demanded for the generall par|don which the Emperour hath granted vnto them.

But how they &s;hall &s;peed the time will &s;hew.</P>
<P>To day there was giuen order, that both the pri|uate

<P>It is here very confidently reported that the Church of S. <HI>Stephen</HI> which &s;tandeth in the new City &s;hall be demoli&s;hed, be&s;ides &s;ome 300 hou&s;es more to build a Ca&s;tle there.</P>
