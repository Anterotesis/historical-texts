<HEAD>A Repre&s;entation to King and Parliament, of &s;ome of the Unparralleld Sufferings of the People of the Lord, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI> Together with the Remarkable Judgments of God upon &s;undry of their Per&s;ecutors.</HEAD>
<P>IN the&s;e few Lines; O KING; Thou and thy Parliament, may &s;ee the continu|ed Sufferings of thy faithful and loving Subjects, under the cruel and bloody hands of the Prie&s;ts and Rulers, in <HI>New-England,</HI> who in the dayes of <HI>O. C.</HI> (the time of thy Suffering) as if countenanced and Commi&s;&s;ionated by him, did, for divers years, mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly &s;poil and ruine the Goods of thy Innocent Subjects there, halling them out of their Habitations to Pri&s;on, far from their Families and little Ones, cruelly torturing their Bodies with Whipps, and pitched Ropes, and locking up neck and heels in Irons many hours, with fami&s;hings near unto death, being without pitty to the aged Parents, or to their help|le&s;s Children; Chaining to a Log of Timber Night and Day, a long and very cold Win|ter; dragging Men along by the hair of their Heads, and the tender Women (as they were on their knees in Prayer) dragg'd out of the Hou&s;e by the hands, with their faces towards the Earth, over Stumps, and old Trees, through very deep fro&s;t and &s;now, to Pri&s;on near a Mile; and cau&s;ing the Innocent to be hanged up naked by the hands, with a logg hanged to the feet, and the body cruelly beaten by the hands of a &s;trong Negro with Cords; one burned in the Hand, and in his Mouth bound a great Key; others their Ears part cut off; together with Bani&s;hing Fathers, Mothers and Children, and offering to &s;end their little Ones thou&s;ands of miles from their Native Country and Fathers Hou&s;e, to be &s;old for Servants or Bond-&s;laves; and la&s;t of all, in the height of the &s;pirit of the wicked one, the &s;pirit of madne&s;s, blindne&s;s, blood and murther, they &s;pared not, but cruelly put to death the Servants of the Living God. And now, O King, &s;ince the very day the Lord brought thee into this Land again, and gave unto thee thy Regal Power, have they in thy Name, made &s;trange and cruel havock of thy true Subjects, in putting to Death and Bani&s;hing; and in thy Name with many torturing Whippings of Old and Young, at Po&s;ts, and at wheels of great Guns, and at Carts Tails, dragging the naked Bodies of Parents and Children through divers long Towns, through the dirt &amp; filth of their Chanels and Cart-ways; and in thy Name commanding one Friend and Brother to help Impri&s;on the other; yea, in thy Name they have lately pre&s;t the Son to help to force his tender Father and Mother to Goal, &s;undry miles, in the extremity of Winter &s;ea&s;on, to the hazzard of their Lives; and &s;uch as refu&s;ed to obey their Unnatural and Abominable Commands, they have fined at their Courts; and thus from Court to Court do the&s;e Mon&s;ters of Men, in thy Name, Fine and break open the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and Rob them of their Goods, and take away that they &s;hould eat in, and that they &s;hould drink in, yea the very Cloathes from their Backs in Winter, and the Bed they &s;hould lye on, while they keep the Body &s;undry miles off in Pri&s;on, driving Husbands &amp; Wives divers miles for Pri&s;on, in times of great Fro&s;t and Snow, keeping them clo&s;e Pri&s;oners in a very cold Room, to the endangering of their Lives, and to the ruine of their Families, had not the Lord pre&s;erved. All this, and much more, too tedious to mention at this time, have they done to the &s;ervants of the Lord in <HI>New-England</HI> in thy Name; &s;aying, that <HI>Thou owne&s;t their doings, and e&s;teeme&s;t their Laws as thy Laws;</HI> And the&s;e hard things have the Servants of the Lord patiently &s;uffered, and &s;u&s;tained at their hands, for no other cau&s;e but for their faithful obedience to the Spirit of the Lord in their hearts, which Spirit of Holine&s;s teacheth them, That <HI>Forced Wor&s;hips</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hippers</HI> are <HI>both Abomination to the Lord.</HI> The&s;e few Lines are written not from any de&s;ire of the lea&s;t Revenge from thy hand upon them, but that thou maye&s;t know it, and make known thy di&s;like of their wickedne&s;s, that &s;o the blood of the Innocent there, if po&s;&s;ible, might not be laid to your charge in the terrible Day of the Lord, in which both High and Low mu&s;t come to Judgement, and receive according to their Deeds done in the Body, in which day the Lord will make known (in the &s;ight of all his Enemies) his mighty Power for the &s;aving of his beloved Ones, and for the delivering and helping of them, who had no helper in the Earth.</P>

<HEAD>A Brief Relation of the Eminent Hand and Judgments of the Lord upon &s;ome of the Rulers, Prie&s;ts and People of <HI>New-England,</HI> who were of them that Per&s;ecuted the People of the Lord, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> there.</HEAD>
<P>OLD <HI>John Endicot</HI> Governour, that <HI>Nero</HI>-like unju&s;t Judge of the Innocent, who in his mad <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>-like &s;pirit, threatned and endeavoured to weary out and to de&s;troy the Servants of the Mo&s;t High, and to root out their very Name from among&s;t them. He with his Hangman, that Murderer, who together had imbrued their hands in the blood of the Innocent Lambs of the Living God, were both by the hands of the Lord hewed down &amp; at one time laid on their death-beds, &s;o that &s;ome did &s;ay, <HI>Who would have thought the Head and Tail &s;hould go &s;o near together?</HI> So the Lord cut down <HI>Endicot,</HI> Root and Branch, and his Hangman its &s;aid died in great horror of Mind, and torment of Body. And this is according to the Word of the Lord fore-&s;poken by the mouth of his Servants concern|ing them.</P>
<P>Another Eminent Per&s;ecutor, (who had a hand in Judging and Murthering of the Inno|cent) <HI>Humphery Atherton,</HI> their Major General, who &s;itting to Judge the Ju&s;t, he and his Brethren having &s;ent out <HI>Mary Dyer</HI> to be murdered, and tydings being brought to the Bench that &s;he was turned off the Gallows, he &s;aid to the &s;ervants of the Lord, Pri&s;oners at the Bar, <HI>That Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> Dyer <HI>did hang for a Flag for them to take warning by;</HI> and <HI>that the Quakers did often tell them, That the Judgements of the Lord would come upon them, but the Judgements of the Lord are not come upon us yet.</HI> But the Ju&s;t Hand of the Lord met with him in his Jollity and Pomp, as he was riding home from his Play-fellows in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and near the Place where they u&s;ed to fini&s;h their Journey in Whipping and dragging the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> at a Carts-tail out of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> his Hor&s;e gave him &s;uch a deadly throw, that it's &s;aid, <HI>He never &s;pake word after his fall;</HI> but his Eyes &s;welled, as &s;tarted out of his Head, and as it were Blood and Brains came out of his No&s;trils and Ears, and his Tongue in a ga&s;tly man|ner hanging out of his mouth; <HI>A Flagg indeed was he for Blood-guilty Men to be warned by;</HI> according to the word of the Lord, fore-told by the mouth of his Servants.</P>
<P><HI>John Danford,</HI> a Member of their Church, and Captain of their Ca&s;tle by <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> being laid (in the heat of the day) upon his Bed, the Hand of the Lord in a &s;trange manner, with a crack of Thunder, and fla&s;h of Lightning, in a moment &s;mote him to death; &s;o it's te&s;tified, he never &s;pake more.</P>
<P>On that day the Rulers and Prie&s;ts of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> had agreed to mingle their Sacrifice with the Blood and Lives of the Innocent, the Per&s;ecutors returning, and rejoycing in the mur|dering and hanging of <HI>William Robin&s;on</HI> and <HI>Marmaduke Steven&s;on,</HI> as &s;undry of them were pa&s;&s;ing over a great Draw-Bridge, it &s;uddainly brake down in pieces with them, and divers of them were wounded and brui&s;ed with the weighty fall thereof; and one or two of them, who &s;eemed to joy in the Death of the Innocent; its &s;aid, That the Bones of their Armes, with Thighs and other parts of their Bodies, were broken to pieces, and after a few days torment of Body, and rotting alive, died: And in this al&s;o was the Word of the Lord fulfilled, &s;poken to the Bench by the mouth of that faithful Martyr, who &s;aid, <HI>Take heed ye Rulers what ye do, and be warned before it be too late, and know, that in that day you put us to Death, &s;hall the Judgements of God come upon this place.</HI></P>
<P>Old <HI>Thomas Wiggin</HI> Magi&s;trate, a bloody Per&s;ecutor, who was deeply engaged in the Sufferings, and in the taking away of the Lives of the Martyrs of Je&s;us, who often without bowels of pitty, would &s;hed the Blood and devour the Goods of the Innocent; him al&s;o hath the Hand of the Lord cut down, and his Children may come to want: And this al&s;o is according to the Word of the Lord, by the mouthes of his Servants to him.</P>
<P><HI>James Oliver,</HI> that Bea&s;tly, and bloody &s;pirited Creature, who as one implacable, unmerci|ful, without bowels of common natural affection, who was &s;o &s;wift to &s;hed Innocent blood, that he &s;truck down the Servant of the Lord, <HI>William Robi&s;on,</HI> as he was taking him out of Pri&s;on to hang him. Who&s;e inhumane cruelty, blood&s;hed, and murderous &s;pirit, the Righteous God hath in Remembrance, who was fierce to take away the Lives of the Righteous; the bla&s;ting hand of the Lord is ri&s;en up, again&s;t and over him; according to the Word of the Lord &s;poken by his faithful Servants, whom he helped to hang on a Tree.</P>
<P><HI>John Webb,</HI> that proud Per&s;ecutor, whom the Lord hath laid wa&s;t, who with a Body of Men in Armes, led forth <HI>Mary Dier</HI> to be murdered and hanged: 'Tis &s;aid, as he was bu&s;ie in killing a Whale, or great Fi&s;h, was &s;uddenly after a &s;trange manner carried into the Sea and drowned; and here was a remarkable Hand al&s;o upon this Per&s;ecutor, according to the Word of the Lord &s;poken by the mouth of his Servants.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>John&s;on,</HI> who led forth the Servant of the Lord, <HI>William Ledra,</HI> to be murdered and hanged, compa&s;&s;ing him about with Men of War, with Swords, Guns, and Drums; the Ju&s;t Hand of the Lord, for his bloody act, hath fallen upon him al&s;o, for he is as a man unman'd and bereaft of his wonted under&s;tanding, and &s;o &s;otti&s;h, that his Brethren, as its &s;aid, have degraded him; and this is according to the Word of the Lord, &s;poken by his Servants concerning him.</P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;hal Brown</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> who Per&s;ecuted the Servants of the Lord, and unrighteou&s;ly took away their Goods; &s;oon after the Lord ca&s;t him upon the bed of langui&s;hing, where for a time, it is te&s;tified, he lay in great horror of Con&s;cience, and torment of Body, and &s;o departed this Life; and this is according to the Word of the Lord by the mouth of his faithful Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Archer,</HI> Mar&s;hal in <HI>Salem,</HI> who was of their Church-fellow&s;hip, he had often Robbed and &s;poiled the Goods of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to pay his Ma&s;ters Reckonings at the Taverns; he was &s;uddenly cut off, and is come to nought, and his remembrance rotts; according to the Word of the Lord again&s;t &s;uch as do re&s;i&s;t the Holy One willfully.</P>
<P><HI>James Underwood,</HI> a wicked Per&s;ecuting Con&s;table who made it his work to di&s;turbe the People of God in their holy waitings on the Lord, who would Pre&s;s one Friend to help him to lead another as Pri&s;oner; after this his wickedne&s;s again&s;t the Lord, and his People, though he had a con&s;ider|able E&s;tate, yet the hand of the Lord being again&s;t him, he came to nought; this al&s;o is accord|ing to the Word of the Lord which his Servants te&s;tified concerning Per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>An Eminent hand of Gods di&s;plea&s;ure upon &s;ome of the Prie&s;ts al&s;o: <HI>John Norton,</HI> Chief Prie&s;t in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and chief in &s;tirring up the Rulers to Murder, Hang and Per&s;ecute, and to take away the Lives of the Innocent, He by the immediate power of the Lord was &s;mitten, and as he was &s;inking down, by the fire-&s;ide, being under Ju&s;t Judgment, he confe&s;&s;ed the hand of the Lord was upon him, and &s;o died; and the Word of the Lord, by the mouth of his Servant, whom he &s;tirred up the Rulers to put to death, was fulfilled upon him.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Edward Norris,</HI> Prie&s;t in <HI>Salem,</HI> he &s;tirring up the Rulers and People there to madne&s;s, &s;aying, <HI>What was done to the</HI> Quakers, <HI>was not Per&s;ecution but Pro&s;ecution;</HI> as he was vindicating his bloody Principle, was &s;uddenly and &s;trangely &s;mitten dumb in his Pulpit, and after a while died.</P>
<P>Old Prie&s;t <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> who reviled the Servants of the Lord as they were led forth to be put to death, was al&s;o by the Hand of the Lord &s;wept away.</P>
<P><HI>Timothy Dolton,</HI> Prie&s;t of <HI>Hampton,</HI> he hearing it certified, that <HI>The Light within, was the Light of Christ;</HI> Cried out, <HI>Oh horrible bla&s;phemy!</HI> He &s;oon after dies.</P>
<P>Prie&s;t <HI>Mitchel</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who lately &s;tirred up the Rulers to Per&s;ecution and Madne&s;s, &s;oon after was &s;mitten down by the hand of the Lord; and it's te&s;tified, <HI>That his very Tongue, while he was alive, turned exceeding black in his mouth, and &s;oon after he died.</HI></P>
<P>Sundry others, not here mentioned, hath the hand of the Lord vi&s;ited with Judgments upon them&s;elves, &amp; upon the fruit of their Bodies, taking away the Lives of divers of their Fir&s;t-born by unu&s;ual deaths; and from year to year to this day, &s;ince they murdered the Servants of the Lord, hath the hand of Ju&s;tice bla&s;ted their Corn in their Fields; for when their fields of Wheat are in the Ear, and near to Blo&s;&s;ome, then is it in a &s;trange manner &s;mitten with Death at the Root; and when the Husbandman &s;eeth the Cur&s;e or Bla&s;t upon it, ha&s;teth to mow it down, while it is green, for Fodder; but its loath&s;ome to the Bea&s;ts of the field, &s;o that they care not to eat it. This is remarkable, and a lively Figure of <HI>New-Englands</HI> Abominable Profe&s;&s;ion, and a true token of Gods di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t them; according to the Word of the Lord &s;poken to them by the mouth of his Servants whom they put to death.</P>
<P>And now hath the Lord, in Bloody <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> poured out a &s;ore Plague, even a rent between Ru|lers, Prie&s;ts and People; &s;o that in the bitterne&s;s of their envious hearts, they are ri&s;en up one a|gain&s;t another, to the endangering of da&s;hing their <HI>Babel</HI> to pieces: And this they know was foretold, and certified to and among&s;t them, by Word and Signs, by the Lords Servants, who te&s;tified in the Name and Spirit of Truth, <HI>That as a Potters Ve&s;&s;el, &s;o &s;hould they be broken never to be joyned together any more.</HI> The&s;e things are written not in Malice or Prejudice to any of the forementioned Per&s;ecutors, but in tender love to all Rulers, Prie&s;ts and People, that they in the fear of the Lord may be warned by them, to take heed how they open their mouths, or lift up their hands again&s;t the Innocent, for God is on their &s;ide; and although &s;ome, to their own de|&s;truction, have been &s;uffered to per&s;ecute and put &s;ome of the Bodies of the Children of the Living God to death, yet again&s;t the Life and Power of the Lord in them, they nor their weapons &s;hall never pro&s;per, the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it. And as for them that remain of the dark Per&s;ecuting Prie&s;ts, Rulers and People in <HI>New-England,</HI> who&s;e hands have been dyed in the Blood and lives of the Innocent, Oh that there were in them an heart truly &s;en&s;ible of their great wick|edne&s;s again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his People, that &s;o they might be truly humbled before the Lord, and &s;o come to be delivered from the wrath to come, which will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly overcome and de&s;troy all them that fight again&s;t the Lord.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>New-England, New-England,</HI> how can the tender-hearted, (whom thou ha&s;t mo&s;t cruelly Per&s;ecuted and de&s;pitefully u&s;ed) in the &s;ence of thy &s;ad &s;tate, forbear to take up a Lamentation for thee; who &s;eemed beautiful in thy beginning, and lovely wa&s;t thou whil&s;t in thy integrity, which was but for a moment, or as the early dew, for thy day was eclip&s;ed in the morning, and thou &s;oon went a whoring from the Guide of thy youth, and &s;o thou became&s;t as a mon&s;trous woman in his &s;ight, and now thou art unto him as <HI>Sodom,</HI> and thy off-&s;pring as <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> who peri&s;hed in the morning; for thy Wickedne&s;s is as <HI>Scarlet,</HI> and thy Iniquities as <HI>Crim&s;on</HI> before the Lord. Let the ears of Kindred, Nations and People, that hear of thy <HI>horrible Apo&s;tacy,</HI> tingle; for thou &s;oon grew'&s;t great, and &s;aid'&s;t in thy heart, <HI>I am as Queen of all Nations;</HI> and in the greatne&s;s of thy Pride, as thou attempted'&s;t to climb up high, even into the Throne of God, How art thou fallen, oh thou untimely daughter of <HI>Babylon!</HI> Let all People and Profe&s;&s;ors who hear of thy deadly fall, fear, and tremble, and dread the Living God, and with &s;peed come out of their <HI>empty Forms,</HI> the <HI>Chambers of Death,</HI> and come into the <HI>mighty Power of the Endle&s;s Life of God,</HI> that in it you may e&s;cape the wrath of the Almighty, which is coming upon the World, which lies in wickedne&s;s. Wo unto you ye Rulers and Hierling Prie&s;ts of <HI>New-England,</HI> for the Lord hath found you in the way of <HI>Cain,</HI> who have drunk the blood of Martyrs and Saints, and mingled it with your Sacrifices, and in the filthy error of <HI>Balaam,</HI> Per&s;ecuting and Killing the Ju&s;t. Wo unto you Rulers and Prie&s;ts of <HI>New-England,</HI> who have taken coun&s;el to de&s;troy the Work of the Lord, and have laboured to &s;uppre&s;s the Sun in its ri&s;ing: Ye are as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his <HI>Magi|cians;</HI> for you have with&s;tood him who is come in his mighty Power, to lead <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of <HI>Ae|gypts</HI> darkne&s;s and hou&s;e of Bondage. Wo unto you Prie&s;ts and Rulers of <HI>New-England,</HI> who have cut off the Life of the Prophets from among&s;t their Brethren, and have cruelly entreated the Children of the Lord, whom he hath &s;ent, and rai&s;ed up among&s;t you: You have &s;lain the Lords Worthies upon your High Places; therefore upon your Mountain comes no Dew nor Rain, and your Hou&s;e is left de&s;olate, be|cau&s;e the Lord is departed from it, for in it is found the Blood of the Martyrs of Je&s;us; and there it is you have killed the tender Lambs in the Bo&s;om, and the Royal and lovely Babes as they were Sucking the Bre&s;ts of their Mother. <HI>For the&s;e things &s;ake will I ari&s;e and plead with you, O ye the greate&s;t of mine Enemies, &s;aith the Almighty,</HI> who in the height of your Pride boa&s;ted, and &s;aid, <HI>There was not &s;uch another Church in the World, as the Church at</HI> Bo&s;ton: But your bloody hands have made you manife&s;t to be the wor&s;t, among them called Churches in the whole World.</P>
