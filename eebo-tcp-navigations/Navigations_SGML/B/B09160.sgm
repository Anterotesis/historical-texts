<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO ALL MY DEAR FRIENDS Elect and Precious IN AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>STand fa&s;t in the Faith which <HI>Christ Je&s;us</HI> is the Author of, by his heavenly En&s;ign, in your heavenly Armour and in your heaven|ly Weapons, your feet &s;hod with the heavenly Go&s;|pel, and your Heads pre&s;erved with the Helmet of Salvation, and your Hearts pre&s;erved with the Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o &s;tand feeling and &s;eeing <HI>God's</HI> Banner of Love over your Heads, manife&s;ting that you are the good ground, that <HI>God's</HI> Seed has taken root downward in, and &s;pring upward in, and bring forth Fruits in &s;ome 60. and in &s;ome 100 fold in this Life; to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God, alwayes beholding the Sun of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, that never &s;ets, ruling the &s;upernatural Day of which you are Children, and the per&s;ecutors Sun (the heat of it which ri&s;es and &s;etts again) cannot &s;corch your Blade, which it may do that Seed that grows on the &s;tony Ground.</P>
<P>And therefore, be valiant for God's Truth upon the Earth, and fear him, that can break their <HI>Fetters,</HI> there <HI>Goals,</HI> and there <HI>Bonds</HI> in &s;under, and can make your Fleece to grow again, after the Wolves have torn the Woll from your Backs; for <HI>the Rod of the wicked &s;hall not be alwayes upon the backs of the righteous.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore mind Chri&s;t, who is the fir&s;t and la&s;t, who bru&s;es the Head of him who is the Head of all Per&s;ecutors, to wit, the Devil.</P>
<P>And con&s;ider how all the <HI>Faithfull</HI> in all Ages &s;uffered from righteous <HI>Abel</HI> to Ju&s;t <HI>Lot,</HI> and the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and all the true Pro|phets by the fal&s;e, and Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tles by the vagabond profe&s;&s;ing <HI>Jews</HI> (out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) and what rejoycing it was to them to &s;uffer for the Lord Je&s;us, and how it was given unto them, <HI>not onely to believe, but al&s;o to Suffer;</HI> &s;o it was a Gift of God to them, not onely to believe, but to &s;uffer, and to carry them up in their Suffering.</P>
<P>And con&s;ider how all the Martyrs and Saints have &s;uffered &s;ince the Apo&s;tles dayes, by the <HI>Heathens</HI> and fal&s;e Chri&s;tians; and &s;o there is no new thing under the Sun.</P>
<P>And therefore keep your Meetings in the Name of Je&s;us, who&s;e Name is above every Name, in who&s;e Name you have &s;alvation; and be valiant for God's Truth upon the Earth, and &s;ound his Name abroad and keep in the Truth, and give no ju&s;t Occa&s;ion to the Adver&s;ary; for the Lamb mu&s;t have the Victory; and keep in the Lords Power, that is over all, and in his peaceable Truth, in which you will feel the Good and eternal Welfare &amp; Salvation of all People.</P>
<P>And the Prophet <HI>E&s;aiah</HI> &s;peaking of Chri&s;t &s;ayes, <HI>In all their Afflctions he was afflicted, &amp; the Angel of his Pre&s;ence &s;aved them,</HI> &s;o all Friends feel the <HI>Lord</HI> in all your Afflictions.</P>
<P>And the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>we our &s;elves glory in you in the Churches of God, for your Patience and Faith in all your Per&s;ecution and Tribulation that you</HI> indure.</P>
<P>So here you may &s;ee the Saints are one another's Joy in the Lord, who doth uphold them in all their Per&s;ecutions, Tribulations, and Sufferings; and therefore look over the Devil, that is out of Truth, that makes to &s;uffer, to Chri&s;t, who brui&s;es his Head; and in Chri&s;t, who is fir&s;t and la&s;t, in him have you Re&s;t, Life and Peace.</P>
<P>And you &s;ee by faith, Mo&s;es <HI>cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer Afflictions with the People of God, then to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>So by Faith, <HI>he e&s;teemed the Reproaches of Chri&s;t greater Riches, then the Trea&s;ures in</HI> Egypt.</P>
<P>And by <HI>Faith</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>for&s;ook</HI> Egypt, <HI>not fearing the Wrath of the King, for he indured, as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible;</HI> and &s;o by Faith God's People now for&s;ake <HI>Egypt</HI> in Spirit.</P>
<P>And by <HI>faith the Mouthes of the Lyons were &s;topt;</HI> and <HI>by faith they indured Tortures, not expecting De|liverance that they might obtain a better Re&s;urection,</HI> and by Faith they underwent all the <HI>Cruel mockings, &s;corgings, Bonds and Impri&s;onments;</HI> and by Faith they under went <HI>Stoneing and Sawing a&s;under,</HI> and were <HI>tempted</HI> and <HI>&s;lain with the Sword,</HI> and <HI>they wandered about in Sheep-skins and Goats-skins, being de&s;titute, afflicted and tormented, of whom the World was not worthy,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e lived in the one Faith, by which they &s;aw him who was invi&s;ible, which is the Faith of God's elect now (which Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the Au|thor and Fini&s;her of) which Faith upholds his Peo|ple now, as it did them, again&s;t the Per&s;ecutors in Dayes and Ages pa&s;t.</P>
<P>And hold fa&s;t the hope which anchors the Soul, which is &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t, that you may float above the worlds Sea; for your Anchor holds &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t in the Bottom, let the Winds, Storms and raging Waves ri&s;e never &s;o high: And your &s;tar is fixt, by which you may &s;teer to the eternal Land of Re&s;t, and Kingdom of God: So no more, but my Love to you all.</P>
