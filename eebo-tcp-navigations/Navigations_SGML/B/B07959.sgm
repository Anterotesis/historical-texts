<HEAD>Extract of a certaine letter written from <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> the 23. of Aprill. Wherein may appeare how farre <HI>Tilly</HI> had then proceeded again&s;t that City.</HEAD>
<P>THe 12. of this Moneth, the Generall <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Tilly</HI> pre|&s;ented him&s;elfe in full Battaile a Mile from this Cittie, and &s;eemed as if he would have a&s;&s;aulted this Cittie with his whole Army with maine violence. But he effected nothing, onely he cha&s;ed &s;ome of our &s;ouldiers out of their Radoubts which they guarded, but never medled with the great Starre|&s;conce, which is built by the <HI>Old Elve.</HI></P>
<P>The 13. the Generall planted 12. Ordnance vpon the banke of the River <HI>Elve,</HI> and with the &s;ame made 568, &s;hot upon the
<PB N="5" REF="4">bridge of this Citie, intending to ruine the &s;ame, and &s;eparate it from the Citie&punc; To the end he might thereby prevent us from &s;econding the Toll-hou&s;e, and the Sconce, but with his vehement &s;hooting he prevailed not much. The Mar&s;hall <HI>Diderick Valckenburgh,</HI> gave order that certaine peeces of Ordnance &s;hould be planted upon the Toll-hou&s;e, wherewith we &s;o played upon the enemies Ordnance, that they were con&s;trained to remove them from the Battery.</P>
<P>In the meane while, the Generall with a great fury and a crying noy&s;e, brought his Army dejectedly upon the Toll-Sconce, and all the day, as al&s;o mo&s;t part of the night follow|ing a&s;&s;aulted the &s;ame with 8. &s;everall a&s;&s;aults. Intending al|&s;o to pre&s;&s;e through the out-workes, to which end the foote &s;ouldiers were prickt on by the hor&s;e with rigour and vio|lence, but were faine to retyre. For the Mar&s;hall <HI>Valker|burgh</HI> had charged the 4. Ordnance double, with &s;tones, lead, and iron, and &s;et the Souldiers and Cittizens in good order, and brought them again&s;t the enemie: in&s;omuch that the E|nemies that night about twelve of the clocke retyred. Many of them being &s;laine. Next morning, our &s;ouldiers hor&s;e and &s;oote fell out of the Citie, and brought in many of them Pri|&s;oners and many maimed, who declare that in this encounter 2000. men were &s;laine.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of this &s;ucce&s;&s;e and deliverance which it hath plea&s;ed God to affoord, we have &s;ome time of breathing.

<HEAD>A true Information in what manner the Citie of <HI>Mag|denburgh</HI> was ouercome by the Lord <HI>Iohn Tilly,</HI> Ge|nerall of the forces of the Emperour, vpon Tue&s;day the <HI>10.</HI> of <HI>May, 1631.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Together with the wofull and lamentable pre&s;ent e&s;tate and condition thereof.</HEAD>
<P>AFter that the &s;aid Generall had, as is reported, ma|ny times offered the City conditions of peace, yea, and vpon the Munday the ninth of <HI>May,</HI> being the day before hee tooke it. But the Citizens would not harken thereunto, no nor in the lea&s;t manner would &s;o much as take it into their con&s;ideration or vnder&s;tandings, though he threatned them, it would otherwi&s;e fall very heavy vpon them, and being fur|ther admoni&s;hed by the Burgoma&s;ter, even upon the Tue&s;day morning before it was taken. A writing was read vpon the wall of the Citie, expre&s;&s;ing a peace then offered to have beene ratified, with the &s;aid Ci|tie, the Arch-dukes of <HI>Saxon, Brandenburgh,</HI> and the hou&s;e of <HI>Stattene,</HI> conditionally that they would bee &s;ubiect to the Popi&s;h &s;iege, the which they in no wi&s;e would con&s;ent vnto, but willingly they would much rather lo&s;e their lives and goods.</P>
<P>The Citizens waited and attended with certaine hope, not daily but hourely to bee &s;uccoured by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and in the meane time the Citizens &s;aw that <HI>Tilly</HI> rai&s;ed his forces, and removed his Lei|ger, and carried away bag and baggage, and &s;o mar|ched for halfe a league from them, in which time the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for want of hor&s;es at hand could not come forward with his Artillery, whereupon the Em|perours
<PB REF="8">forces on the Tue&s;day morning early, turned their forces, and after it was too manife&s;t the Empe|reours forces had &s;o filled a Ditch neere a gate of the City, called the <HI>Heyecker.</HI> Then with greene gra&s;&s;e or weedes that the Souldiers could wade thorow, though it was deepe to their middles, and &s;o carried &s;caling ladders on their backes, and &s;o entred the Towne while&s;t the Burgers were in their Churches at prayer and thanke&s;giving to God for the departure of their enemies, which &s;o &s;eemed to doe the day be|fore, in which time the watch on the wals were 2000. Souldiers, 18. companies of Burgers being in all neere 4000. fighting men, the enemy a&s;&s;aulted and entred, the Citizens places together, and at an in&s;tant two Cornets of hor&s;emen in blue harne&s;&s;e, with the re&s;t of the enemies which plundred ouer them, out to pie|ces and murdered all there, and this continued three houres, in which time the Citie was &s;et on fire in foure or fiue places, and it is yet vnknowne whether it was done by Trea&s;on, or by the immediate hand of God, but the &s;odaine increa&s;e and fiercene&s;&s;e thereof was &s;uch by rea&s;on of a wonderfull winde, that in a &s;hort time all the fires met, and the &s;poylets that plundred were forced to leaue the mo&s;t part of the women, maides, and children were &s;mothered and &s;tifled in Vaults and Sellers, where they had hid them&s;elves. Some part of them driven into the fire by violence, many others throwne into the fire, and part of the beautifulle&s;t yong women and maids carried into the Campe, there forced, &s;poiled and carried away in the mean-while, yea, even on that very day was the whole City, with all the in habitants &s;o wa&s;ted by the fire and &s;word, that on the wedne&s;day morning their re|mayned
<PB REF="8">no more &s;tanding but the Cathedrall Church and a very few hou&s;es &s;tanding about it. All the re&s;t both men and bea&s;ts con&s;umed to a&s;hes, that the &s;word left. And none e&s;caped except &s;ome very &s;mall number that were here &amp; there, which with very great peril ran away, &amp; it is manife&s;t that aboue 20. thou&s;and were murthered and con&s;umed by fire, of men, wo|men and children. And al&s;o above 1500. hu&s;bandmen of the Country dwellers thereby, with their wiues &amp; children, with many others Gentlemen of great &s;ort &s;uffered with the Citizens which were gotten into the Citie for their defence.</P>
<P>Al&s;o divers Inhabitants of &s;everall Villages within the Bi&s;hopricke and parts adioyning: brought in their ancient Deeds and Records of the Lands and E&s;tates which &s;uffered as the Citizens, and none had quar|ter or deliverance, except one company of Souldiers which de&s;ired and had quarter promi&s;ed them.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Feeld Martiall Falkenburge</HI> a mo&s;t valiant Souldier &s;ent by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> for the defence of the Citie: was offered pardon and quarter by his e|nemies, but he and his valiantly de&s;pi&s;ed it, and rather cho&s;e to fight and die manfully, and pre&s;&s;ing into the market place, fought vntill hee and his had &s;laine 400. but being ouer-matched by the whole multitude of his enemies that &s;econded each other again&s;t him, was &s;hot to death, and &s;o left by a hou&s;e wholy &s;et on fire, and &s;o left.</P>
<P>The Lord Admini&s;trator or Bi&s;hop of the Citie and Confines, having in the flight received a wound on his head, was among&s;t other prime men taken, carried a|way pri&s;oner to <HI>Wulfonbuttell</HI> a fort of the Enemies:
<PB REF="9">having before he was taken de&s;ired his owne Servant to have killed him, but he would not.</P>
<P>In this manner as is &s;et downe that brave Citie of <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> by fire and &s;word, was in one day con&s;umed with many thou&s;ands of Chri&s;tian poore &s;oules therein as is mentioned. Be&s;ides an infinite of riches utterly brought to nothing, that doubtle&s;&s;e &s;ince the de&s;truction of <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> &s;carce any the like wofull &s;pectacle of the great and &s;odaine deva&s;tation of &s;o famous a Citie, and the lo&s;&s;e of &s;o much Chri|&s;tian bloud hath beene heard of. God of his mercie &s;ave and deliuer all Chri&s;tian people their Countries, Lands, and Cities from any the like wofull mi&s;hap, and that for Ie&s;us Chri&s;t his &s;ake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
