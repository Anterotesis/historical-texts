<P>AMong&s;t all the Wonderful and Prodigious Creatures that have been &s;een in this Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince the Age of Man, none &s;o &s;trange, nor &s;o great as an Elephant, and which is more, it cometh neare&s;t in wit and capacity, to man, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith; for they under&s;tand the Language of that Country wherein they are bred: they do what&s;oever they are commanded, they remem|ber what duty they are taught, and withal take delight both in love and glory: Nay, more then all this, they embrace good|ne&s;s, hone&s;ty, prudence, and equity, (rare qualities to be found in men) and withal have in Religion, reverence, (with a kind of Devotion) not onely the Stars and planets, but the Sun and Moon they al&s;o wor&s;hip. And &s;ome writers report thus much of them, that when the New Moon beg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">neth to appear bright, they come down to a certain River named <HI>Amelus,</HI> in the De|&s;arts and Forre&s;ts of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> where after they are wa&s;hed, and da&s;hed them&s;elves all over with the water, and have &s;aluted and adored, after their manner that planet, they return again into the woods, carrying before them their young Calves, that be wearied and tired. Moreover&punc; they are thought to have a &s;en&s;e of Religion and Con&s;cience in others; for when they are to pa&s;s the Seas into another Countrey, they will not Embarque before they be induced thereunto by an Oath of their Gover|nours, that they &s;hall return again; and &s;eeing there have been divers of them, being infeebled by &s;ickne&s;s (for as big as they be, &s;ubject they are to grievous Malladies) to lie upon their backs, ca&s;ting and flinging Herbs up towards Heaven, as if they had procured and &s;et the Earth to pray for them. Now for their Docility and aptne&s;s to learn any thing, the King they adore they kneel before him, and offer unto him Garlands and Chap|lets of Flowers, and green Herbs. The le&s;&s;er &s;ort of them, which they call Ba&s;tards, &s;erve the <HI>Indians</HI> in good &s;tead to plow their Ground.</P>
<P>They breed in that part of <HI>Africk</HI> which lyeth beyond the De&s;erts of <HI>Syrtes:</HI> al&s;o in <HI>Maurita<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ia,</HI> they are found al&s;o among&s;t the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> and <HI>Troglodites,</HI> but <HI>India</HI> bringeth forth the bigge&s;t: as al&s;o the Dragons that are continually at variance with them, and evermore fighting, and tho&s;e of &s;uch great|ne&s;s that they can ea&s;ily cla&s;p and wind round about the Ele|phants, and withal, tye them fa&s;t with a Knot. In this Conflict they dye, both the one and the other: the Elephant falls down dead as conquered, and with his heavy weight cru&s;heth and Squeeezeth the Dragon that is wound and wreathed about him.</P>
<P>In <HI>India,</HI> from whence this Elephant came, they take them in this manner: The Governour driveth one of them that are tame, into the Cha&s;e and Forre&s;ts, and when he can meet with one of them alone, or &s;ingle him from the Herd, he beateth the wild bea&s;t till he hath made him weary, and then he mounteth upon him, and ruleth him as well as the other.</P>
<P>In Africk they catch them in great ditches, which they make for that purpo&s;e, unto which if one of them chance to fall, and cannot get out; &s;o &s;oon as he is &s;een by other Elephants, they imediately come to &s;uccour him, they bring all the boughs they can get, and put them into the Ditch, then rowl down blocks and &s;tones, and any thing that will &s;erve to rai&s;e a banck, then &s;trive all they can to pluck him out.</P>
<P>The manner of taming (as furious and raging mad as they be &s;ometimes] is with hunger and &s;tripes; but men mu&s;t have the help of other Elephants that are tame already, to re&s;train the unruly Bea&s;t with &s;trong Chains, In the Indian and Afri|can Wars they &s;erved to carry Ca&s;tles with armed Men on their backs, to enter the Squadrons and battalions of the Ene|mies, and for the mo&s;t part, all the &s;ervice in the Wars of the Ea&s;t, was performed by them, they broke the ranks, bore down armed men that were in their way, and &s;tamped them under foot. The&s;e terrible bea&s;ts [as outragious as they &s;eem) are frighted with the lea&s;t grunting of a Swine.</P>
<P>They breed but once in all their l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">fe time, and go two years with young, yet bring forth but one neither; al&s;o they Live commonly by cour&s;e of Natu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e 200 years, &s;ome of them 300. Their youthful time and &s;trength of age beginneth when they be &s;ixty years old, but this which is brought over into England is &s;aid to be but &s;even.</P>
<P>The Truncks and bodies of Trees is the be&s;t meat they have, and therein take mo&s;t delight. They chew and eat their Meat with their mouth, but they breath, drink, and &s;mell with their Trunck, which is not improperly called their hand. Of all other living creatures they cannot abide a Mou&s;e or a Rat, and if they perceive their provinder lying in the Manger ta&s;t or &s;cent never &s;o little of them, they refu&s;e it, and will not touch it. They are mightily tormented with pain, if they chance in their Drink|ing to &s;wallow down an Hor&s;e-Leech, for as &s;oon as the hor&s;e-Leech hath &s;ettled fa&s;t in his Wind-Pipe it putteth him to in|tollerable pains; their skin or their backs is mo&s;t tough and hard, but the fle&s;h &s;oft and tender, covered their skin is neither with hair nor bri&s;le, no not &s;o much as in their tail, which might &s;erve them in good &s;tead to drive away their trouble&s;ome flyes. Their skin is full of cro&s;s wrinckles, and be|&s;ides that, the &s;mell thereof is able to draw &s;uch vermine to it; and therefore when they are laid &s;tretched along, and perceive the flyes &s;ettle in &s;warms on their skins, &s;uddenly th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">y draw &s;uch cranies together clo&s;e, and &s;o cru&s;h them all to Death: their teeth bear a very high price, and were reckoned very com|mendable by the Heathens, to make the Stautes and Images of their Gods; but the greate&s;t u&s;e that we make of them here, is to make Combs, as we may &s;ee here at mo&s;t Comb-makers doors in London.</P>
<P>Now having given you an account of their under&s;tanding, how they breed, the manner of taking and taming of them, I will now inform you of one lately brought over into England, and give you a full De&s;cription of it, as thus: This Elephant is of a Dun colour, the body of it [though but young) is bigger then the bodies of two hor&s;es, a &s;trange, wonderful, and mighty large head, with a Trunk or No&s;tril extending a yard down|wards, Eyes but ordinary, Ears like a Blood-Hound, hanging down, Legs as big or bigger than an ordinary mans body, and feet proportionable, &amp;c. But this being not above &s;even years old, is not grown the &s;ixth part to what it will be about &s;ixty years hence, if it live &s;o long.</P>
<P>If any per&s;ons are de&s;irous to &s;ee this wonder of Bea&s;ts, let them repair to the <HI>Ri&s;ing-Star</HI> in St. <HI>Johns-Court,</HI> neer <HI>Clerkenwell|green,</HI> where they may have true information, where they may &s;ee it, it being kept neer it.</P>
