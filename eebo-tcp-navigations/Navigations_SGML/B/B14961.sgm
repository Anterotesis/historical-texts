<P>_FRom <HI>Mayland</HI> wee receiue tydings that the Commaunder and Governour there hath &s;ent <HI>Serbellone</HI> with his foot-forces again&s;t <HI>Riva;</HI> and <HI>Philippo Spinola</HI> again&s;t <HI>Como,</HI> with the hor&s;e|men: for feare lea&s;t the Duke <HI>de Rohan</HI> &s;hould fall into <HI>Italy</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> forces and the <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">bunters,</HI> or <HI>Gri&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>Wee vnder&s;tand by Letters from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that the great tempe&s;tuous broyles are &s;omewhat of late appea&s;ed.

<P>All is indifferently quiet for the pre&s;ent. The March is vp and downe, too and fro. The Souldiers daily ride a pillaging for bootie. <HI>Bavaria</HI> and the <HI>Vpper-Palatinate</HI> doe now goe to wrack, and are vtterly ruined. This Citie is fortified; Gods religious wor&s;hip is here brought to its forme and ancient

Vpon <HI>Trinitie Sunday</HI> there was Service and Sermons in both the new Churches; where many thou&s;and people came together with great joy and exultation to &s;erue God: and for very joy, many teares were &s;hed.

<HEAD>From <HI>Norimberg</HI> the <HI>18.</HI> of <HI>Iune.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We receiue newes out of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> that the Elector of <HI>Sax|on</HI> hath for&s;aken almo&s;t all he did po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> &s;ince the Citie of <HI>Prague</HI> was &s;urrendred againe to the Duke of <HI>Fridland:</HI> and that he keepes nothing there, but onely the Citie of <HI>Eger</HI> and the Ca&s;tle <HI>Elenbogen;</HI> and that he with the re&s;t of his Army, is gone backe towards <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> and to <HI>Tir|na,</HI> which are di&s;tant one from the other but two leagues. Therefore the &s;aid Duke of <HI>Fridland</HI> was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue and follow him with his Army, con&s;i&s;ting of neare 40000. men. The &s;aid Generall <HI>Fridland</HI> hath al&s;o &s;ent an Army into <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> again&s;t the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgs</HI> forces there; by rea&s;on whereof the &s;aid Elector doth excu&s;e him&s;elfe, that he cannot &s;end any &s;uccours to him of <HI>Saxon.</HI> And therefore it is conceiued, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> (being made acquainted with all this) hath beene induced to change his other de&s;ignes and re&s;olution. Thus his Maje&s;tie hath for&s;aken <HI>Bavaria,</HI> onely he hath well fortified and &s;trengthened with &s;ufficient Garri&s;ons, <HI>Aug&s;burg, Donawert,</HI> and <HI>Raine:</HI> And that in his ab&s;ence, the promi&s;es made vnto him may be the better kept, and the monies due at <HI>Munchen</HI> and els-where for contribu|tion and vpon agreement, the &s;urelier payd: his Maje&s;ty hath cau&s;ed many per&s;ons of qualitie, as Burgemai&s;ters, Coun&s;el|lors, and other Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall per&s;ons to be brought from thence to <HI>Aug&s;burg,</HI> thereto remain as Ho&s;tages. Two Dukes of <HI>Saxon Wimar</HI> (named, as I vnder&s;tand, <HI>Ernest</HI> &amp; <HI>Bernhard</HI>) haue beene left by his Maje&s;tie about <HI>Memmingen</HI> and in the vpper part of the Circle of <HI>Swaben,</HI> with an Army of aboue 8000. men. And the Duke Admini&s;trator of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> is
<PB N="2" REF="3">to joyne 8000. more with them; and withall to ob&s;erue toge|ther, the actions both of Generall <HI>O&s;&s;a,</HI> and of the Arch-duke <HI>Leopolds</HI> forces. The &s;aid Dukes of <HI>Saxon Wymar</HI> haue lately defeated the troupes of the Souldiers and Boores commanded by the Earle of <HI>Embs,</HI> taken the &s;aid Earle with his Counte&s;&s;e; and now they are marching towards <HI>Lindaw.</HI></P>
<P>On this very day his Maje&s;t. of <HI>Sweden</HI> is at <HI>Furt,</HI> one league di&s;tant from hence, where I vnder&s;tand he doth keepe his ge|nerall Rendezvous, and mu&s;tereth 20000. good men. In his pa&s;&s;age this way, he hath taken in <HI>Aich&s;tadt,</HI> becau&s;e the Ma|gi&s;trates there had not kept the Treatie they made formerly with his Maje&s;tie; and had never payd the promi&s;ed Contri|bution. His Maje&s;tie hath al&s;o beaten with Canons, &amp; quick|ly taken in the &s;trong Towne and Ca&s;tle (a good place and of great con&s;equence) called <HI>Pappenheym,</HI> belonging to Generall <HI>Pappenheym.</HI> The people that went to &s;ee the Mu&s;tering doe much extoll how braue an Army it is: In this Citie there hath beene made bread for the &s;aid Army of aboue 200. bu&s;hels of Corne, which with other victualles hath beene &s;ent thither. There was al&s;o made very great preparation for the entertain|ment of his Maje&s;tie; for it was hoped he would ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e come into the Citie, as indeede the Magi&s;trates did humbly invite him. But he excu&s;ed him&s;elfe, &amp; I heare his Maje&s;tie among&s;t other merry words &s;ayd: <HI>He had at this time a greater de&s;ire to &s;ee Wal&s;teyn then Norimberg.</HI> His Maje&s;tie hath di&s;patched from hence 2000. hor&s;e towards <HI>Coburg,</HI> there to joyne with other forces, to ob&s;erue and hinder (as &s;ome doe &s;uppo&s;e) <HI>Pappenheym,</HI> if he &s;hould endevour to pa&s;&s;e: There haue beene &s;tayed in this Citie all Waggon-hor&s;es, for the carriage of the Ordnance towards <HI>Forcheim,</HI> which is &s;ayd &s;hall now be be|&s;ieged; Yea &s;ome doe beleeue, that the King him&s;elfe hath an enterpri&s;e again&s;t it; But I dare boldly &s;ay, that no body as yet knoweth what his Maje&s;tie intendeth to doe, and therefore we mu&s;t expect till time doth di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> hath beene the&s;e three dayes (before the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> a rived at <HI>Furt</HI>) in this Citie. The Magi|&s;trate doth much re&s;pect and honour him, and hath pre&s;ented
<PB N="3" REF="3">him after the wonted manner, with a pre&s;ent of Fi&s;h, Wine, Oats, &amp;c. His Maje&s;tie gaue ye&s;terday a vi&s;ite vnto the Prin|ce&s;&s;e Palatine of <HI>Sult&s;bach,</HI> and to the Marchione&s;&s;e Dowager of <HI>On&s;pach.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bavarian</HI> forces that lye in the <HI>&V;pper-Palatinate,</HI> haue made an inrode into the Marqui&s;ate of <HI>On&s;pach,</HI> and haue pil|laged the chiefe Towne called <HI>On&s;pach.</HI></P>
<P>It is certainly beleeved, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> will take his March through the <HI>&V;pper-Palatinate</HI> into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> di|rectly to <HI>Eger;</HI> and thereabouts to joyne with the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> his Armie; for we doe get notice, that there is &s;ent to <HI>Eger</HI> great &s;tore of victualls and other provi&s;ions: His Ma|je&s;tie of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath al&s;o &s;ent backe to the &s;aid Elector &s;ome Amba&s;&s;adors, to giue him notice of what he is de&s;ired to doe, and to repre&s;ent vnto him the ill and &s;u&s;pitious behaviours of his Lieutenant-generall <HI>Arnheim.</HI> Wee doe not yet know, whether King <HI>Frederick</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> will follow his Maje&s;tie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or whether he intends to goe to the <HI>Lower Palati|nate,</HI> as &s;ome doe pre&s;ume.

That al&s;o they labour to continue a perpetuall warre in the&s;e <HI>Netherlands.</HI> That they are the cau&s;e, (as your Highne&s;&s;e is well acquainted with) that the truce was not contracted; and that they will ever take the vpper hand, and highe&s;t places, and preheminence, with contempt of all other Nations.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VVHereas I doe certainely know that all the world will &s;peake and cen&s;ure diver&s;ly, concerning the lo&s;&s;e of my government; and that many will blame mee (though vnju&s;tly for the &s;ame: I cannot but acquaint your Honours, that becau&s;e it was ordained (again&s;t my will and good liking) that the Souldiers &s;hould be drawne off, which then I &s;tood in &s;o great need of, for the pre&s;ervation of the Countrey. Yea, and notwith&s;tanding that I had given intelli|gence and notice, how that the Enemy was about to a&s;&s;em|ble
<PB N="6" REF="5">his forces at <HI>Moock,</HI> not farre from my Government, by which meanes I am at this pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ible of a great lo&s;&s;e.

And whereas I &s;till continue a mo&s;t naturall affection and inclination to the pro|&s;perity and welfare of the Countrey, it &s;orely grieues mee to &s;ee matters brought to &s;uch a lamentable pa&s;&s;e, and the State in this &s;o woefull a ca&s;e as it is now in: this hath cau&s;ed mee to &s;end the&s;e printed lines to your Honours, wherin you &s;hall find &amp; &s;ee the re&s;olution which I haue taken for the redre&s;&s;e, welfare, and happine&s;&s;e of the Country, and of vs all in gene|rall: well hoping, yea tru&s;ting, that it will not onely be agree|able and acceptable to your Honours, but al&s;o that you will moreover be plea&s;ed, to contribute to this my de&s;igne and en|terprize, to the end wee may obtaine a golden and a happy peace in the &s;tate of this Countrey. Wherefore I am further willing to declare vnto your Honours, that this di&s;content &amp; di&s;plea&s;ure of mine hath partly proceeded from that grudge and evill conceit, which the Marquis <HI>de Leganes</HI> (who&s;e cre|dit and reputation your Honours are well acquainted with|all) hath taken again&s;t me: and tho&s;e evill &s;ervices and turnes which he hath done me in <HI>Spaine,</HI> at the Court, and with his Maje&s;tie: and all vpon the&s;e two rea&s;ons e&s;pecially.</P>
<P>The one was, becau&s;e it was the meanes of preventing and hindring the City <HI>Bruxels</HI> from being pillaged, when the Ar|my was before it, and when the Citizens were in &s;uch per|plexitie, and knew not how to yeeld that which was de|maunded of them. And moreover he him&s;elfe was in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, that he plucked the feathers from his hat in my pre|&s;ence, and in the pre&s;ence of many more. Whereas the Mar|quis <HI>Spinola</HI> of happy memory, gaue mee great thankes for that I was the meanes of freeing tho&s;e Citizens from &s;uch a danger, when they opened the gates to the end they might not incurre the extreame&s;t danger.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P>The other rea&s;on was, becau&s;e (as the afore&s;aid Marqui&s;e <HI>de Leganes</HI> once vpbraided me in a vehement anger and pa&s;|&s;ion, in the pre&s;ence of the a fore&s;ayd Marqui&s;e <HI>Spinola</HI> of happy memory) I had &s;ometimes giuen the vauntguard to the <HI>Italians,</HI> which (as hee thought) was due to none but the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> according to the order and direction of the Kings Maie&s;tie. Moreouer I doe perceiue, and finde it &s;uffi|ciently that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> doe de&s;ire my death, which al&s;o by this appeared, when they hauing on a time my picture or portraicture, did &s;hoote the &s;ame thorough and thorough, which is at <HI>Bruxels</HI> in the &s;treete neere vnto the &s;tone-gate. And which is more then all this, they would neuer &s;end me the Letter which according to their own relation was writ|ten by the King to me concerning the office or place which his Maie&s;ty did proffer me in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and yet notwith&s;tan|ding they would know my minde and declaration concer|ning the voyage into <HI>Spaine</HI> before euer the Letter was de|liuered into my hands. The&s;e and many other di&s;contents &s;o well grounded, and giuen mee vpon &s;euerall occa&s;ions (which would be too long to relate) and would cau&s;e all the world to wonder, how po&s;&s;ibly I could &s;o patiently beare them, as al&s;o of tho&s;e manifold wrongs which your honours haue &s;uffered the&s;e many yeares, and doe yet daily &s;uffer, and that withall, you now &s;ee the poore people &s;o mi|&s;erably oppre&s;&s;ed and ruinated; the &s;ouldiers not payd, but euill entreated doe giue me great hopes that your honours will contribute vnto, and a&s;&s;i&s;t and further mee in this my de&s;igne and re&s;olution, and that hence forward you will loath and abhorre the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gouernment, which <HI>Spaniards</HI> by their daily meetings and a&s;&s;emblies (which we call <HI>Iun|tas</HI>) haue vtterly &s;poyled and depraued the whole bu&s;ine&s;&s;e and matter.

<P>As for newes you &s;hall haue this little, which is a&s;much, as the &s;hortne&s;&s;e of time will permit mee to &s;et downe, to wit, that we haue (as yet) no tydings that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army hath fought with that of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> before <HI>Ma&s;tricht:</HI> True it is that they haue beene neere one vnto the other for this &s;eauen nights &s;pace, but the <HI>Hollander</HI> is &s;o well entren|ched, that the other doth not know where to attacque him vnle&s;&s;e with great lo&s;&s;e of men, and vncertaine &s;ucce&s;&s;e, and therefore holds it better, to endeauour to cut off the meanes of victualing the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Army, about which (as we vn|der&s;tand) they are now in hand. In the meane &s;pace, there is a rumour that the <HI>Rhyne-graue</HI> hath pa&s;&s;ed ouer the <HI>Mo&s;ell</HI> with great forces, &amp; is comming into this land to doe more hurt, &s;o that the common people are in a great Quandary, we haue (euery day) in this City a watch of a thou&s;and men which &s;tand at the Gates, who are all Citizens, and we expect out of hand a thou&s;and &s;ouldiers to come, and two Cornets of hor&s;e, which newes doth much di&s;content, but there is no remedy, fora&s;much as their loyalty is much &s;u|&s;pected, and the rea&s;on (in particular) mouing thereunto is this, vpon <HI>S. Peters</HI> Eue la&s;t (in the night) there were certaine vnknown per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled together in the &s;treets who vpon no occa&s;ion giuen, did beate downe a &s;igne which repre&s;ented the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and not contented there|with, they threw &s;tones at the Ie&s;uites Church-doore, &s;ang P&s;almes, and cryed aloud voyce <HI>Vive le Prince d'Orange.</HI> This noi&s;e continued two nights together, &s;o that vpon Thur&s;day la&s;t being the 29. of the la&s;t Moneth, at 3. a clock
<PB N="9" REF="6">in the Morning (by order from Court) the Drums began to beate and to call vp the Citizens to Armes, but all in vaine, for the parties who had made the great noy&s;e were gone before the others were a&s;&s;embled, neuerthele&s;&s;e there is a Proclamation, that who&s;oeuer can appeach any of the fore&s;aid offenders, &s;hall haue 500.
