<HEAD>Upon Debate of the Rea&s;ons of Reduction, <HI>in prae&s;entia,</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>22. February 1673. THE LORDS FIND</HI> that Rea&s;on of Adjudication, that the Strangers had not Pa&s;&s;es conform to the <HI>Formula</HI> agreed upon in the Treaty betwixt the Kings Maie&s;ty and the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> (albeit the Ships loo&s;ed from <HI>Norway,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Iuly, 1672.</HI> long after the breaking out and knowledge of the War) not to inferre a Confi&s;cation of the Ships, and Loadings alone; But that it importeth a ju&s;t ground to &s;eize and bring the &s;ame to Tryal, and that it putteth the burden of Probation upon the Strangers, by Documents and Witne&s;&s;es above exception: That the Ships and Loadings belong to the Kings Allies, and Freemen, and not to the Kings Enemies <HI>AND FIND,</HI> that the Oaths of the Skippers and Owners, which would have been &s;ufficient, if they had been adhibited at the obtaining of the Pa&s;&s;es, conform to the <HI>Formula,</HI> are not now &s;ufficient to clear the Property of the Ships and Loadings. <HI>AND THAT</HI> the being of no Pa&s;&s;es aboard relative to the Voy|age, but general Pa&s;&s;es before the War, and that by the Skippers Oaths, it appears that they con|cealed the Fraught-Brieffs, and that they were hid apart from the re&s;t of the Documents and found by the Privateer; and bear a greater Fraught to be paid, in ca&s;e the Ships were brought up to <HI>Holland;</HI> provided a &s;afe Delivery were made of the Goods; <HI>DOTH IMPORT,</HI> an intended Delivery of the Goods in <HI>Holland,</HI> notwith&s;tanding of the Mi&s;&s;ives and Documents aboard. <HI>AND FIND</HI> the &s;ame grounds joyntly to be a &s;ufficient pre&s;umptive Probation of a Contrivance, and that the Ships and Goods are not free. <HI>BVT YET,</HI> to admit of a contrary po&s;itive Probation by Documents and Witne&s;&s;es above exception; That the Ships and Loadings belong to the Subjects of <HI>Denmark,</HI> His Maje&s;ties Allies, unle&s;s the Privateer prove the &s;ame to belong to the Kings Enemies. <HI>LIKE AS THE LORDS FIND,</HI> that the true Port being concealled, or made Arbitrary by the Fraught-Briefs, if the Privateer &s;hould in&s;truct. That Dail-boards &s;uch as were in the&s;e Ships, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ounterband by the Cu&s;tome of the Admirality of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> that ground was &s;ufficient, (though the Ships and Goods were proven to belong to Freemen) to infer Confi&s;cation of both. <HI>THEREFORE THE LORDS <HI>granted Commi&s;&s;ion mutually, to either Party, for proving the Property and Value of the Ships and Goods; the quantity of the Loadings, and that the Port de&s;igned was</HI> London: <HI>And to the Defenders, that the Goods were Counterband.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>But upon a Petition given in by the Pur&s;uers, Repre&s;enting a mi&s;take in the &s;aid <HI>Interlocutor,</HI> as to the matter of the Fraught, (the Fraught being not a greater for <HI>Holland,</HI> than for <HI>England,</HI> but a le&s;&s;e.) And craving the Benefit of a contrary Probation, as to the matter of Counter|band, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Eodem die.</HI> The Lords ordain the&s;e words, <HI>Viz, [That the Fraught-Briefs bear a greater Fraught to be paid, in ca&s;e the Ships were brought up to <HI>Holland,</HI> provided a &s;afe Delivery were made of the Goods, which the Lords find, did import an intended Delivery of the Goods in <HI>Holland,</HI> Notwith&s;tanding of the Mi&s;&s;ives and Documents aboard;</HI> to be left out of the <HI>Interlocutor,</HI> and grant a contrary Probation to the Pur&s;uers to prove, That Dails are not Counterband; And ordain the Probation to be <HI>hinc inde,</HI> vp Docu|ments above exception.</P>

<HEAD>Information for the STRANGERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Reduction of the Decreets of <HI>Adjudication</HI> of the &s;aid Ships, the <HI>Palm-tree</HI> and <HI>Pa|tience,</HI> the pretended grounds of <HI>Adjudication,</HI> being coincident as to both; the Lords, by their Interlocutor, <HI>Feb.</HI> 22. 1672. allowed the Pur&s;uers to prove the Propency of the Ships, and Goods, and Value. And likewi&s;e to prove the <HI>Daills</HI> that were their Loadings, were not <HI>Counter-band</HI> by the <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> of the <HI>Admiralities</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol|land.</HI> And allowed the Defenders to prove the contrary.</P>
<P>After which Interlocutor, there was a Bill given in by the Defenders, pretending, that by His <HI>Maie&s;ties In&s;tructions,</HI> it was declared; That <HI>the having or u&s;ing</HI> of fal&s;e, <HI>or</HI> double <HI>Do|ctuments</HI> or <HI>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ling of Papers,</HI> was a ju&s;t ground of Confiscation. And that it was proved, and acknowledged by the Skippers that there were <HI>concealed Papers</HI> the Skipper of the <HI>Palm-tree,</HI> hauing <HI>denyed,</HI> that he had any <HI>Charter-partie,</HI> which notwith&s;tanding was concealed, a Ship-board; and the Skipper of the <HI>Patlentia,</HI> having declared, <HI>that he had no Paper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> concealed, except a Charter partie, and mi&s;&s;iue Letter.</HI> And thereupon craving, That the Ships, and Goods might be declared lawful Pri&s;e upon that ground. Notwith&s;tanding whereof the Lords adhered to their former Interlocutor: but declared that they would con&s;ider the &s;ame, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">me of the advi&s;ing the Reports.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="12">
<P>There was then Reports made upon the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion, whereby the points of the Inter|locutor were fully cleared and proven, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Property of the Ships and Goods did belong to the Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cts of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and the Value was likewi&s;e proven, and the Cu&s;toms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> That <HI>Daills</HI> were not <HI>Counterband.</HI></P>
<P>It being alledged, That notwith&s;tanding, the Ships and Goods mu&s;t be declared lawful Pri&s;e upon the Pretences contained in the Bill, <HI>viz. That the Skippers acknowledge by their</HI> Depo|&s;itions that <HI>there were Papers concealed.</HI></P>
<P>It was an&s;wered, The Pretences are of no weight: and it were indeed a Preparative, the like whereof did never e&s;cape the <HI>Publict Justice</HI> of any Nation, upon &s;uch impertinent and frivolous Conceits, to deprive his <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> Allies of their Ships, and Goods, after &s;o clear and full and undenyable a <HI>Probation</HI> of the Propertie, as is here proven at three &s;everal Places, <HI>vix. Sunder|burg</HI> in <HI>Denmark, Christiania</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> and at <HI>London.</HI> So that it is impo&s;&s;ible any &s;cruple can remain, but that the Propertie of the Ships and Goods did truely belong to the Subjects of the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and were as truely de&s;igned for the Port of <HI>London,</HI> as is clear by the &s;ame Probation.</P>
<P>And as to what was urged upon the <HI>concealing of Papers,</HI> albeit there had been Papers con|cealed, His Maje&s;tie's <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> could be here no ground of Confi&s;cation. 1. Becau&s;e his Maje&s;tie's <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> were long after the Capture, and could not be extended <HI>quoad praeterita.</HI> 2. By the 24. Article of the <HI>Dani&s;h Treaty,</HI> which is <HI>lex bell,</HI> it is provided, that Ju&s;tice and Equity &s;hould be admini&s;tred to the Subjects of either Crown, <HI>according to the Statutes and Lows</HI> of either Countrie: and therefore no &s;uch private <HI>In&s;truction</HI> could prejudge the Pur&s;uers contrary to the <HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>But here the Pretence of <HI>concealing Papers</HI> was frivolous. For. 1. when the Ships were taken, the Skippers did produce to the Captain of the Privateer certain Papers, and cold him that they had tho&s;e which were pretended to be <HI>concealed</HI> a Ship-board; and de&s;ired liberty to bring the &s;ame: which he refu&s;ed, and in&s;olently told them, <HI>That they behoved to go to Scot|land,</HI> what ever Papers they had aboard, <HI>for they did not know what GREAT OWNERS be had.</HI> And withall then &s;aid, <HI>that they might then produce their Papers when they were in Scotland.</HI> 2. When they were brought to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Skippers before the Admiral, declared, <HI>That they had the &s;aid Papers a Ship-board,</HI> and were allowed to go a Ship-board and fetch them; and did go in company of the Privateer. And as one of the Skippers was taking out of one part of the Ship one Paper, the Captain of the Privateer, or &s;ome of his Officers did fall upon the <HI>other,</HI> not having the patience, till the Skipper took it out him&s;elf. And if that be a prettie <HI>Concealment,</HI> the Lords wre de&s;ired to judge. 3. What imaginable rea&s;on could there be, for any &s;uch <HI>fraudulent Concealment,</HI> as to <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Capers; the Papers alledged to be <HI>concaled</HI> being Documents of the Ships <HI>Freedom,</HI> and that the <HI>Port de&s;igned</HI> was <HI>London:</HI> the Papers being <HI>Freight-brieffs,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;&s;iue Letters,</HI> dicreet to Mr. <HI>Shorter,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Splide</HI> at <HI>London.</HI> 4. The <HI>Clau&s;e</HI> in His Majt&s;tie's <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> can only be under&s;tood in &s;uch a ca&s;e, when Writs are <HI>ab&s;tracted</HI> and <HI>concealed,</HI> and whereof the <HI>tenor does not appear,</HI> and &s;o <HI>in dubio</HI> are pre&s;umed for the condemnation of the Ship, or <HI>if found,</HI> do make out the &s;ame. But what is that to the purpo&s;e here? For, <HI>primo,</HI> The Depo&s;ition of the Skipper of the Ship called the <HI>Patientia,</HI> bears, <HI>That he had no Papers concealed, but a Charter partie, and a mis&s;ive Letter, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">go</HI> he having <HI>declared</HI> the &s;ame, it was no <HI>Concealment.</HI> And the &s;en&s;e of the Depo&s;ition is &s;ingly this; That he had them a Ship-board, and which he had hid upon the account of the <HI>Holland</HI> Capers, the&s;e clearing that the <HI>Port de&s;igned</HI> was <HI>London,</HI> and which did not appear from any of the Docu|ments not concealed. <HI>Secundo.</HI> The Skippers depo&s;ition of <HI>the Palm-Treee,</HI> bears only a <HI>Denyal,</HI> that he had any <HI>Charter-parry:</HI> but he acknowledged that he had a Brieff, which is wronguou&s;ly tran&s;lated to be a <HI>Letter;</HI> although it is true that he had &s;uch a <HI>mi&s;&s;ive Letter.</HI> And <HI>Brieffs</HI> in the <HI>general</HI> comprehend all Papers. And the Paper found a Ship-aboard, was not a <HI>Charter-party,</HI> (which is a <HI>Contract</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed by two, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Skipper</HI> and the <HI>Freighter</HI>) but onely a <HI>&s;imple Obligement</HI> for payment of the <HI>Freight:</HI> &s;o that this was no <HI>Concealment.</HI> And this was likewi&s;e hid for fear of <HI>Dutch Capers;</HI> and it is again&s;t &s;en&s;e, to pretend the contrary. And it were a rare piece of <HI>Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tice</HI> to condemn <HI>Ships</HI> upon tho&s;e <HI>Papers,</HI> which are the <HI>Documents</HI> of their <HI>freedom.</HI> And there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> he Ca&s;e of any Ships, where there was &s;o clear a <HI>Pro|bation,</HI> add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ced, as to all P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mi&s;sion.

<P>And as to that Quality of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">, bearing. <HI>That if Daills were proven counterband by the Cu&s;toms of</HI> England <HI>or</HI> Holland, <HI>it &s;hould be a ground of Confi&s;cation; albeit the Ships and Goods were proven to belong to free-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n; in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pect the Freight-Briefs are arbitrary, as to the Port.</HI></P>
<P>It was an&s;wered, 1. That it was ab&s;urd to pretend, that the <HI>Freight-Briefs</HI> are arbitrary, as to the Port, the Port of <HI>London</HI> being the true <HI>de&s;igned Port,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> only mentioned in the ca&s;e of <HI>contingency,</HI> in ca&s;e the Ships &s;hould be brought up thither. 2. By the <HI>Probation</HI> ad|duced, <HI>London</HI> is po&s;itively proven to have been the intended <HI>Port.</HI> 3. The Capers have not at
<PB N="20" REF="13"> all proven, that by the <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> of the <HI>Admiralties</HI> of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> Daills are <HI>counter|band;</HI> but on the contrary, it is proven by the <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Admiralties,</HI> that Daills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">re not <HI>counterband.</HI> 4. By an Extract under the hand of Secretary <HI>Coventry,</HI> of His Maje&s;ties De|claration in favour of the <HI>Danes,</HI> it is evident, that no Goods are <HI>counterband</HI> as to the <HI>Danes,</HI> ex|except <HI>Ammunition</HI> and <HI>warlike In&s;truments,</HI> and <HI>Victual carried to places be&s;ieged.</HI> So that al|beit the&s;e Ships had been ab&s;olutely de&s;igned to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and that Daills, by the <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Admiralties,</HI> were <HI>counterband,</HI> neither of which is true; yet, by virtue of the &s;aid Declaration, Daills are not <HI>counterband</HI> to the <HI>Danes.</HI> In re&s;pect of all which, there is not the lea&s;t colour or pretence of Law, why the Decreets of Adjudication of the&s;e Ships &s;hould not be <HI>reduced,</HI> and the Ships and Goods <HI>re&s;tored,</HI> or the Value, as it is proven <HI>cum omni cau&s;a.</HI></P>

<P>And it being informed by the &s;aid Defenders and their Procurators, That in the Reduction of the Decreets of Adjudication of the fore&s;aid Ships, pur&s;ued at the in&s;tance of the &s;aid Skippers, again&s;t the &s;aid Captain and his Owners; Among&s;t &s;everal grounds of Adjudication in&s;i&s;ted upon, which are the grounds of the &s;aid Decreets, &s;uch as the <HI>informality of the Pa&s;&s;es,</HI> and that there was no <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Port <HI>de&s;igned:</HI> the principal ground was, That albeit the Skippers pretended, that the Ships and Goods belonged to Subjects of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and that the Goods were going to <HI>England,</HI> and were to be con&s;igned to Merchants there; and that the Skippers being examined, <HI>concerning the having of any other Papers, but the Pa&s;&s;es produced;</HI> They declared upon Oath, <HI>they had none, but each of them a mi&s;&s;ive Letter directed to their corre&s;pondents in</HI> England: And particularly, being examined <HI>if they had any Charterparties,</HI> they did expre&s;sly depone, <HI>That they had no Charterparties.</HI> And yet, when they had taken out their <HI>mi&s;&s;ive Letters,</HI> in a &s;ecret place upon one &s;ide of the Ship, affirming, they had no more; yet upon the other &s;ide of both Ships, a &s;ecret place was di&s;covered, in which there was concealed <HI>Freight Briefs</HI> for each of the Ships, by which the Freighters did condition to pay to the Skippers of the re&s;pective Ships, each particular Freight upon &s;afe Delivery of the Goods in <HI>Holland.</HI> From which it was Inferred the time of the Debate, That the Pa&s;&s;es being <HI>general,</HI> and not conde&s;cending upon the <HI>Port,</HI> albeit mi&s;&s;ive Letters were directed to Per&s;ons at <HI>London;</HI> yet it was but a <HI>Contrivance,</HI> and which was clearly convelled by the <HI>Freight-Briefs,</HI> which conditioned a Freight for <HI>Holland.</HI> And albeit it was pretended by the Strangers, that the&s;e Freight-Briefs did condition a Freight both to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and only to <HI>Holland,</HI> in ca&s;e they were taken up <HI>again&s;t their will,</HI> and <HI>that the Goods were &s;afe delivered;</HI> yet, &s;o pregnant were the grounds of <HI>prevarication</HI> and <HI>contrivance,</HI> that the Lords upon that Debate, con&s;idering, that the Skippers did &s;wear, that they had no other Papers; they notwith&s;tanding of their Oaths, found the <HI>Freight-Briefs</HI> to be <HI>concealed,</HI> and the grounds in&s;i&s;ted upon, to be a &s;ufficient <HI>pre&s;umptive Probation</HI> of a <HI>Con|trivance:</HI> but yet found, that there was place for a <HI>po&s;itive contrary Probation,</HI> by Writ and Witne&s;&s;es above exception, of the <HI>freedom of the Ships and Goods,</HI> and gave Commi&s;&s;ion for that effect.</P>
<P>The &s;old Lords would be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, That long after this Debate, His <HI>Maje&s;tie's In&s;tractions</HI> which were not then known to the Defenders in the Reduction, were &s;ent to their Lord&s;hips: by which, it was mo&s;t evident and clear, that the having of <HI>double Documents,</HI> or <HI>concealing</HI> of any <HI>Documents</HI> was <HI>per &s;e,</HI> a &s;ufficient ground of confi&s;cation of Ships and Goods; Whereupon, if the Defenders had in&s;i&s;ted, undoubtedly the Lords would have a&s;&s;oiled them. And therefore, &s;eing the Lords, even before knowledge of His <HI>Maje&s;tie's In&s;tructions,</HI> found the <HI>Pre|&s;umptions</HI> of Prevarication and Concealment &s;o &s;trong, as appears by the Interlocutor, and albeit then, a <HI>contrary po&s;itive Probation</HI> of <HI>freedom</HI> was admitted; yet now the Defenders do found upon the&s;e emergent <HI>In&s;tructions;</HI> and alledge, That <HI>e&s;to argumenti cau&s;a,</HI> the Ships and Goods were <HI>free,</HI> which truely they are not, what ever be reported by Commi&s;sions, (wherein great Art and Prevarication is u&s;ed) yet the&s;e <HI>matterial Papers</HI> being expre&s;sly <HI>concealed,</HI> and that upon Oath of the Skippers, <HI>&s;wearing they had no &s;uch Papers:</HI> The very <HI>Concealment</HI> by the <HI>In&s;tructions,</HI> is a &s;ufficient ground of Confi&s;cation, whether the Ships and Goods be <HI>free or not,</HI> and cannot admit of a <HI>contrary Probation.</HI> And therefore, it was hoped the &s;aid Lords would then advi&s;e the Reduction, conform to the <HI>In&s;tructions,</HI> without any regard to what hath been done upon the Commi&s;sions; Whereby in <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> the <HI>Adjudications</HI> mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained: or otherwi&s;e in ca&s;e any &s;cruple remained with their Lord&s;hips, they would allow the Parties Pro|curators a Hearing thereanent. E&s;pecially, &s;eing upon a Bill lately given in by the Defenders, the &s;aid Lords declared, They would hear them upon the <HI>In&s;tructions.</HI></P>
