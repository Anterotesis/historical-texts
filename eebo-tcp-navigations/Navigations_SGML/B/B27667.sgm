The <HI>Sh.</HI> joines with the Capt. and Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> and repre&s;ents <HI>Orpen</HI> as a per&s;on very obnoxious and culpable in the whole proceeding of the Ship. What cannot a man accompli&s;h, tho' never &s;o ill a member? Can he want Friends while he has any thing to give away? The Sh. the Cap. &amp; Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> have received Pre&s;ents from the Ma&s;ter, Pa&s;|&s;engers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whom they immediately re&s;tored to their reputation again; and Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> is as &s;oon traduced to the World: vvho if he had been but earlier in <HI>Pre&s;ents</HI> then the Ma&s;ter, had un|doubtedly bore the Bell; But neglecting to pay the Twenty Guinnyes which the Sh. de&s;ired to have, as a br. or gift, and for refu&s;ing comply|ance to an unlawful Reque&s;t of a Mini&s;ter, is now under tho&s;e dangers which are preacht out a|gain&s;t him and <HI>Crump,</HI> in the perclo&s;e of Mr. <HI>Bl</HI>'s Letter.</P>
<P>The Capt. having carry'd away &s;everal con|&s;iderable <MILESTONE N="41" UNIT="appendix page"> goods of the Ship to <HI>Ro&s;s-Ca&s;tle,</HI> leaves the Sh. in <HI>Glannerought</HI> to come up in his place, Giving him the command of his men; The &s;tores
<PB N="25" REF="16"> being neverthele&s;s frequently robb'd while the Sh. and the Ma&s;ter had care of them; No <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"> marvel it &s;hould be &s;o, while the Soldiers, the <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"> Toryes, and an ill pack which attended the Ma|&s;ter, <MILESTONE N="37" UNIT="appendix page"> were continually about the place.</P>
<P>Now let any unbyast man con&s;ider the condi|tion of that part of the Country, and how ly|able the poor inhabitants thereof are to entertain Toryes in their hou&s;es, when Capt. <HI>Gregoryes</HI> Soldiers have made &s;uch neighbour-hood with them, which is not ob&s;evable altogether in them only, for the Cap. him&s;elf who lives by the &s;word, <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"> who&s;e trade is to fight, and receives the Kings pay upon that account, is of re&s;olution as far from engaging the Toryes as his Soldiers are from be|ing at War with them. And you &s;hall find that the Cap. hath no manner of inclination to &s;up|pre&s;s <MILESTONE N="36" UNIT="appendix page"> the Toryes, and that his men have been kind to him, for allowing them to quarter where the Toryes have reforted: not to kill or take them, <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"> but to have leave to Range upon free quarters, whereby the remedy is become allmo&s;t as bad as the di&s;ea&s;e; upwards of thirty familyes having Fled, bag and bagage, from the cruelty of the&s;e Soldiers, who could not expect that kind of li|berty, <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"> if there were no Toryes; and the Cap's own behaviour in this Affair, de&s;cribes him no otherwi&s;e than a <HI>Moderate Fighter,</HI> or <HI>Wor&s;e;</HI> of which the former indeed is more di&s;pen&s;able: For, if a man be not in&s;pired with Courage, how can it be expected where it is not? And if God
<PB N="26" REF="17"> and Nature de&s;ign'd it for him, he mu&s;t blame the ineptitude of his own Organs, or the Imbeci|lity of the Womb that did not &s;ufficiently purifie them, &s;o as to make them capable to entertain a Spirit &s;uitable to his Profe&s;&s;ion; <HI>Oportet ut mens &s;ana, &s;it in corpore &s;ano;</HI> It is a thou&s;and pities that a Man of his Nerves &s;hould want a Mind: For the other there can be no manner of Pardon in any Per&s;on what&s;oever, that is fal&s;e to his God, and Traytor to his King; and for a &s;mall Pattern of his Heroick Atchievements, look into the Ap|pendix, pag. 35, 37, 40, 26.

<P>But the Sh. who lay all the while in ambu&s;h for a gra&s;p at the Goods, lodg'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with Mr. <HI>Monk,</HI> and by &s;ome means pry'd into the Writings, and next morning he came along with Mr. <HI>Monk,</HI> accompany'd with Cap. <HI>Gregory,</HI> to <HI>Killowen,</HI> where they found the Ma&s;ter, the two Pa&s;&s;engers, and Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> very friendly together.

<P>This Affidavit is a Sample of the contrivances now on foot concerning a wedge of Gold, which Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> pretends he threw a&s;ide under the bed when the Toryes entred the hou&s;e; and by the Philo&s;ophers Stone revers'd was turned into Bra&s;s. But whether he threw it there or not, there was a lump of Metal taken up among the rubbi&s;h, and being delivered to M. <HI>Myars,</HI> he did at &s;everal times in the hearing of &s;everal Gentlemen, own and declare that it was the &s;ame lump or wedge which he had throwne by, and de&s;cribed it by the colour, &s;hape, and &s;ize, and by &s;everal private marks, and particularly by two &s;pecks or bubbles upon the upper &s;urface thereof; Now whether he left any &s;uch lump there as he pretends; or
<PB N="46" REF="27"> whether he would not, if he thought 'twere Gold, have laid his Challenge to any lump, were it the right one or no; or whether, if it were the right one, he had not a mind to deceive the right owner of it, and &s;o cau&s;ed a counterfeit to be made after|wards; or whether he was cheated in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> is yet a que&s;tion; But it admitts of this di&s;cour&s;e, that it's very manife&s;t that the piece or lump which was delivered by Mr. <HI>Mabury</HI> to Mr. <HI>Myars,</HI> carryed the &s;everal marks and &s;pecks upon the upper-&s;ide or upper &s;urface, as the true piece had, which is indeed an infallible a&s;&s;urance (if Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> de&s;cription were true) that it is the right piece, be it Gold, Bra&s;s, or any other Metal whatever; For though its in the power of any ordinary capacity that can run Metals, to imitate in &s;ome &s;ort in the bottom &s;ides or ends of the Counterfeit the marks of the true Piece, yet the &s;pecks, or bubbles, or any other mark upon the upper &s;urface, are accidentals in ca&s;ting, (and in a coat as different from the re&s;t, as the upper coun|tenance of a Pann-pudding differeth from every part of the Geometricall &s;uperficies of the &s;ides and bottom) and not to be imitated by the be&s;t of Arti&s;ts; and for further &s;atisfaction in this point, Enquire at all the Laboratories and Foun|deries within Humane management, and they will tell you that its as impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e <HI>(ad libitum)</HI> a &s;ingle bubble or two (or more properly hony-comb) of exact &s;hape and place upon the upper &s;urface (that &s;ide only in &s;uch flat ca&s;tings
<PB N="47" REF="27"> being lyable to this kind of windy &s;putter) as it is in the power of a Phy&s;ician to lay a well man to bedd and bring a &s;mall pox through his Skin in exact numbers where and when he plea&s;es; and what man will take two pails of water of equal Cylinder and Depth, and having &s;et out upon the margins the 32 points with their Aliquots, and by the plounce of a Pebble-&s;tone having rai&s;ed a bubble accidentally in one of the pails, &s;hall afterwards undertake that in the dropping a thou&s;and pebbles more into the other pail, to rai&s;e a &s;ingle bubble of exact &s;hape point and di&s;tance from the Center, with the former? And if he ever accompli&s;heth it, he may afterwards &s;ay that its a thou&s;and times more impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e <HI>(ad libitum)</HI> in any Counterfeit a hony comb of exact depth, &s;hape, and place, with the copy. Notwith&s;tanding that Ca. <HI>Greg.</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> were un&s;ucce&s;&s;full in their adventure if they de&s;igned to lay out their twenty pounds a piece with <HI>Edward Dunigan</HI> for this intended &s;ubor|nation, which in &s;ome parts of the Kingdom, and among &s;ome &s;ort of folks, migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> perhaps have pur|cha&s;ed a Po&s;t-knight for every pound, e&s;pecially when a poor man is threatned to be hang'd if he refu&s;es to &s;wear what is de&s;ired; yet they were cautious of laying out their money with every man, being as &s;uppo&s;ed only in tru&s;t for the Ma&s;ter and Pa&s;&s;engers, who perhaps would not allow of the charge, unle&s;s they &s;aw the value thereof in good Thundering Oaths, &s;uch as

This Fellovv has &s;vvorn, as it's &s;aid, That Mr. <HI>Mabu|ry</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Could he ca&s;t a Piece of Bra&s;s of &s;ome certain &s;ize or &s;hape, which would &s;erve his turn?</HI> Or to that effect. But this Affidavit being a very &s;light one, its &s;uppo&s;ed to be no more than the price of &s;ome &s;mall Reckoning at the Alehou&s;e. But if he &s;wears thus far it &s;elf for nothing, or in <HI>Forma Pauperis,</HI> what will his Affidavit be, when the Mini&s;ter &s;hall receive Orders from his Owners to lay out the Tvventy Pounds? Do they play upon the Ea&s;ine&s;s of his &s;oft Temper? Or vvill they u&s;e him as the Blind do a Staff, vvhich they thru&s;t out before them to grope out their vvay among the Sloughs, to &s;ave their Feet from the Mire, and their Heads from knocking again&s;t the Walls?</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had &s;ooner An&s;wer'd yours of the 10th, but that I was then from home, at one of the Remote&s;t Places in my Di&s;trict, occa&s;ioned by the coming of the <HI>London-Guinycoa&s;t Frigot</HI> homeward bound at <HI>Ventry</HI> near <HI>Dingle,</HI> which having very narrowly e&s;caped the Seas, had well nigh Peri&s;hed in the Harbour; for com|ing into the Bay, &s;he ran up towards <HI>Ca&s;tlemain,</HI> not knowing the Land; but our Boat going out timely, gave her a Waft and brought her into &s;afe Anchoring: I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;ufficiently heard of the Privateers coming into the River of <HI>Killmare,</HI> and taking the Ships thence; they had likewi&s;e Intelligence and De&s;ign to carry off this; but my going, and &s;ending Expre&s;s after Expre&s;s, partly prevented it; the Captain of her, tho' his Chance &s;uch, is a Rugged, Re&s;olute, Stout Fellow; that will &s;tand to and defend her to the la&s;t, &s;o that I reckon her in no great Danger, unle&s;s he be very much over marcht, while the few Soldiers and the En|gli&s;h that are there, and he cotten &s;o well together. During my being there, I received by 2 Expre&s;&s;es No|tice of another homeward bound Ship the <HI>Laurel,</HI> al&s;o of <HI>London,</HI> &s;tranded within the River of <HI>Kilmare,</HI> which being very unu&s;ual, ha&s;tned me from the utmo&s;t corner over the Mountain to her Relief; but alas, I came too lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to prevent the mi&s;chiefs done her, or to &s;ave any con&s;iderable part of her Cargo, tho' I have done all that was po&s;&s;ible in me to &s;erve the Merchants by pre&s;erving what could be found by the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earches
<PB N="39 [45]" REF="70" MS="y"> and Examination; yet it may perhaps be difficul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> for me to E&s;cape free from Cen&s;ure and Calumny, that came not to the place not till eight days after the Rumage, or Scramble, and none hath yet tender'd him&s;elf to be examin'd only the Ship Carpenter, who&s;e Examination I here en|clo&s;ed &s;end; and if you will accept of the re&s;t upon com|mon fame, as well touching your friend Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> as the Captain and Crew's behavior, It appears to me that the latter, upon what rea&s;on, or without they had a mind to for&s;ake the Ship, and con&s;equently to ruin Her and the Cargo, for they caryed their money a&s;hore on the 28 pa&s;t, and left her to take her chance, when &s;he came a&s;hore pre&s;ently near the upper end of the River, but fleeted now and then, when they went aboard again, having made &s;everal holes in her bottom they for&s;ook her out right, and then Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> went to &s;ave what he could, but too late; who I under&s;tand u&s;ed all means po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve her and the goods. The latter were in a manner de&s;troy'd before he went aboard by the Rable, and water, which was got into her, e&s;pecially the Sugar. When I came there, I found he had taken much pains and care therein and appeared ready to give me an account of what was &s;aved, and how he had laid the goods with the be&s;t &s;afety he could into the mo&s;t convenient hou&s;es for that purpo&s;e; and the Ma&s;ter and Pa&s;&s;engers promi&s;ed he &s;hould have a rea&s;onable &s;alvage; as for the money which they were Robbed of, 'twas car|ryed a&s;hore privatly by them&s;elves; So that he had no hand in &s;aving of that; if he had, it had been better for them, for he would undoubtedly have managed with more prudence. But that Reverend worthy man Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> is ruined by it; having his hou&s;e (where the money lay) and all his Sub&s;tance burnt by the Toryes. Next morning after I came there, I got the Ma&s;ter to go aboard, who I mu&s;t &s;ay, in the condition the Ship was then in, had but little regard of the whole; for he &s;tayed but &s;ome few hours on board; &s;o that I had &s;omwhat to do to per&s;wade him to go to her again till about the 12th I did again importune him
<PB N="34 [46]" REF="71" MS="y"> to look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> after her, the Crew was gone before I came there. He &s;hewed me an imperfect Envoyce but not the former Ma&s;ters Pocket Book; for you mu&s;t conceive that this man was not Shipt as Ma&s;ter, but the Ma&s;ter dying at Sea, he appointed this Man to conduct the Ship home. Pray let me hear from you as oft as any thing occurs, and Oblige</P>
