<HEAD>A <HI>LETTER</HI> to a Member of Parliament concerning the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Piracy.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE>March 20. 1699/700.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but think it my duty (perceiving that your Honourable Hou&s;e is con&s;idering of means for the preventing and puni&s;hing both Pyrats and illegal Traders) to give you a &s;hort hint of the Rea&s;ons why they have grown to a greater heigth in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than in other Colonies on the Main of <HI>America,</HI> and a Propo&s;al for the future preven|tion of them.</P>
<P>It may be almo&s;t needle&s;s to acquaint you that &s;everal of our <HI>American</HI> Plantations are like petty Soveraigntys, having the Choice of Governours, the Power of calling A&s;&s;emblies, making Laws, rai&s;ing Mony by &s;ome former Grants from the Crown, or at lea&s;t the pre|ten&s;ions of them.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e, Intere&s;t being their chief Mover, are re&s;tle&s;ly ambitious of advancing their E&s;tates by drawing away the Trade and Inhabitants from other Colonies that are contigu|ous to them, and more e&s;pecially from tho&s;e that are under the immediate direction of the Crown, as the Proprietary Colonies to the We&s;tward, from the Colonies of <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>In order to this they vie with each other, who &s;hall allow their People the greate&s;t Privile|ges, or mo&s;t exempt them from any Cu&s;toms or Duties on Goods exported or imported; which the King's Governments, e&s;pecially <HI>New York,</HI> cannot avoid, it being a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Supply for the maintenance of the Government, the guard of the Frontiers from the In&s;ults of tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that otherwi&s;e would prove fatal in time of War, not only to them but to the neighbouring Colonies.</P>
<P>Hence it is that in all the Proprietary Colonies the People pretend to an ab&s;olute exemption from Cu&s;toms and Duties, but what is laid by Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> and in mo&s;t to the Choice of all Officers both Civil and Military, in &s;ome not excepting the Council nor the Governour.</P>
<P>The&s;e Officers thus annually cho&s;en, endeavour to do nothing that may di&s;oblige their Electors, le&s;t the next year they are deprived of their Dignities.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Plantations abroad are too much addicted to abet and encourage both Pyrats and illegal Traders, as the Per&s;ons that they gain no &s;mall advantage by cor|re&s;ponding with.</P>
<P>Hence it is that the&s;e Criminals meet with their Encouragement, tho&s;e Officers that &s;hould apprehend, being but too negligent of their Duties, and this from per&s;onal Advantages and Gains they receive by them, or through fear of the People by who&s;e favour they &s;tand.</P>
<P>The Remedies then &s;eem to be plain and ea&s;y, the Bill already read in your Honourable Hou&s;e will undoubtedly give a very great di&s;couragement to Piracy, tho illegal Trade &s;till re|mains to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the Duties accruing to the King to be more effectually pre&s;erved, and the Frontiers of the Government better protected again&s;t foreign In&s;ults; which I am humbly of opinion might be done, if in the Bill that yet lies before you for the puni&s;hing of Governours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you would be plea&s;ed by &s;ome Clau&s;e,</P>
<P>To lay all the Colonies on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> that carry on the &s;ame Methods of Trade, under the &s;ame equal Cu&s;toms on Goods exported and imported, for the maintenance of their di&s;tinct Governments, or the defraying a more general Charge.</P>
<P>To cau&s;e that the Confu&s;ion and Anarchy which now &s;o much prevails in &s;ome of the Colo|nies (in&s;omuch that the Council in their Letters home complain they are hardly &s;afe in their Per&s;ons or E&s;tates; if by a due and vigorous execution of the Law again&s;t Pyrats or illegal Traders, they &s;hould incen&s;e the People again&s;t them) may be &s;ucceeded by an exact obedi|ence to their &s;uperiour Officers, which cannot be expected, until a greater Authority than any Proprietary Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hall appear there.</P>
<P>That to obtain this (&s;ince Property may be alledged by &s;ome, and a right of commi&s;&s;ionating and &s;ending of Governours, which they &s;eem to be &s;o fond of, that the mo&s;t plain Argu|ments drawn from the inevitable nece&s;&s;ity thereof, their own Profit and Advantage&punc; the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the People, and the intire Suppre&s;&s;ion of Pyracy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cannot pre|vail) I hope you will be in&s;trumental in finding out &s;ome ways to bring all the&s;e Co|lonies to a more immediate dependance on the Crown, by giving the King the Nomi|nation and Commi&s;&s;ionating of the Governours and Officers Civil and Military in the re|&s;pective Colonies, and yet re&s;erving all the Rights and Properties that either the Proprietors at home, or the People there may have to the Lands or Plantations in the &s;aid Colonies by virtue of their former Grants from the Crown.</P>
