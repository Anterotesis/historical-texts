<HEAD>THE VOYAGES <HI>AND</HI> TRAVELS Of that Renowned Captain, Sir <HI>Francis Drake, <HI>INTO THE</HI></HI> VVEST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Francis Drake</HI> was born at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> and in his Youth put Apprentice to a Ma&s;ter of a Ve&s;&s;el, during which time he gave him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tudy of Marin Affairs, and grew &s;o perfect therein, that he in the end became the Worlds Wonder, the Nations Glory, and Terror to its Enemies; in demon&s;tration of which, I &s;hall declare his &s;everal Voyages and great Atchievements, till his Death.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Then he having by his many Exploits gained great Ap|plau&s;e, and the Reputation of an able Sea-man, was made Captain of a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and imployed again&s;t the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI> her Mortal Enemy, from whom he took divers Prizes near Home; But not &s;o contented, he, on the <HI>24th.</HI> of <HI>May, 1572.</HI> &s;et Sail in the <HI>Pa&s;chal of Plimouth,</HI> a Ship of <HI>70</HI> Tuns, and mount|ed with <HI>10</HI> Guns, accompanyed with the <HI>Swan,</HI> a Ship of <HI>25</HI> Tuns, and <HI>8</HI> Guns, Commanded by his Brother <HI>John Drake:</HI> having on Board both the Ve&s;&s;els, <HI>73</HI> Men and Boys, with all other Nece&s;&s;a|ries, and having a fair Wind, came to <HI>Guadalupa,</HI> one of the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, on the <HI>29th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> but found nothing there, except &s;ome few Cottages made of Boughs, and covered with <HI>Palmata</HI> Leaves, which &s;ecured them from Rain, in the Nature of Tiles; yet they had &s;ight of two <HI>Canows,</HI> but could not reach them, by rea&s;on the Calm was &s;o great. The&s;e <HI>Canows</HI> are Boats which the <HI>Indians</HI> u&s;e, being for the mo&s;t part cut out of Trees like Troughs, and a piece of Wood fixed on either &s;ide, to keep them from overturning; Whereupon, after they had watered their, they weighed Anchor, and Sailed to <HI>Port Phe&s;ant,</HI> &s;o named, becau&s;e of the abundance of that &s;ort of Foul found there: and there going on Shoar, found that one Mr. <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> had been lately there, and had left an In&s;cription in Lead nailed to a Tree, to warn him not to &s;tay in that Port, fora&s;much as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had notice of his Arrival; yet Landing more Forces, he re&s;olved to &s;tay and build a Pinnace, which he affected, fortifying the Port in the mean while, to prevent any &s;urprize. And whil&s;t they &s;tayed there, a Bark came from the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> bringing in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prize, which joyned with Captain <HI>Drake;</HI> So that having fini&s;hed the Pinnace, the <HI>3</HI> Ships and Pinnace Sailed to the <HI>I&s;le of Pinos,</HI> where they found <HI>2 Spani&s;h</HI> Ships of <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> Lading Timber by the <HI>Negroes.</HI> In tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els they were informed of the State of the City and Country, and that new Forces were dayly expected, to defend it again&s;t the <HI>Symerons,</HI> a Black People, with long Hair, who had Revolted from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by rea&s;on of their Cruelty, and &s;ince cho&s;en them&s;elves two Kings. Whereupon &s;etting the <HI>Negroes</HI> on Shoar with &s;ome gifts, Captain <HI>Drake</HI> re&s;olved to go to <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> which he entered by Night, beating the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"> from their Defences, who hung Lines a thwart the Ea&s;t end of the Street, to make the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> believe, by the lighted Matches tyed thereon, that their Forces were greater than indeed they were, and immediately Fired, which was an&s;wered with a like number of Fire-&s;hot and Arrows from the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> they came to pu&s;h of Pike, and butt end of the Musket, upon which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fled, and the King's Trea&s;ury con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>360</HI> Tun of Silver Bars, and a like value of Gold, had fell into the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> had not Cap|tain <HI>Drake</HI> been unfortunately wounded in the Leg, which cau&s;ed the lo&s;s of &s;o much Blood, that he fainted, yet neverthele&s;s he per|&s;waded his Men to per&s;i&s;t, for that the like advantage could not be expected to be regained, if it was once omitted; but they prefering their Captain's Life before the Trea&s;ure, forced him on Ship-board. In this Battle only one <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> was killed, and three or four wounded by the Weapons the Enemy had ca&s;t away in their flight; &s;everal of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were killed, and taken Pri&s;oners. But Captain <HI>Drake</HI> being now on Ship-board, and well perceiving the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had increa&s;ed their Forces, thought it not convenient with &s;o &s;mall a number, to make a &s;econd attempt, therefore taking a Ve&s;&s;el Laden with Wines, which at his coming he found in the Port; He &s;et Sail for the Port <HI>Plenty,</HI> and there, by the advice of a <HI>Negro,</HI> Care&s;&s;ed the <HI>Symerons</HI> he found there, who being Mortal nemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> joyned Friend&s;hip with him, and greatly furthered his Affairs; and Sailing thence towards <HI>Cartagena,</HI> he took a great Ship Richly Laden, and after that, another, in which were two of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Kings <HI>Scrivendoes,</HI> who were &s;ent from <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> with the News of what had happened there. Yet he acted not &s;o &s;ecretly, but that his coming was known to the <HI>Car|tagenians,</HI> who taking the Alarum, came down to the Shoar in great number, in&s;omuch that <HI>Drake</HI> thought it no ways convenient to Land there: and that his Pinnaces might be the better Maned, he cau&s;ed his great Ship to be &s;unk, after all things nece&s;&s;ary were taken out of her, and Sailed from that Port, lying for &s;ome time undi&s;covered, about a League thence, and cau&s;ed the <HI>Negroes</HI> to build a Hou&s;e, to &s;helter his Men from the violent Storms of Rain, that fell during his &s;tay; To which place the <HI>Indians</HI> brought &s;tore of Water and Victuals, for which they were amply gratifyed.
<PB N="4" REF="4"> At which place leaving one Ship, he, with the two Pinnaces, Sail|ed to <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> where Roving up a great River, the Marriners were much afflicted with the in&s;ufferable &s;tinging of Flyes, called <HI>Muskalos,</HI> again&s;t which there is no Remedy, but Iuice of Lemons, with which the skin being wet, they will not fa&s;ten. In the River he met two <HI>Indian Canows,</HI> in which were Fi&s;her-men, but took no notice of them, for fear of being di&s;covered, but pa&s;&s;ing for <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> the Captain and his Men came to a Store-hou&s;e, on the Ri|ver &s;ide, where he found great plenty of Provi&s;ion, prepared for the Fleet that was about to return into <HI>Spain;</HI> after which, having notice that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were coming down, they returned to their Pinnaces, and &s;oon after took five or &s;ix &s;mall Barks, Laden with Provi&s;ion, &s;etting the Men on Shoar, and &s;o Sailed to the Country of the <HI>Syme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ons,</HI> who kindly received them.

<P>The Sickne&s;s ended, <HI>Drake</HI> returned to the Fort, where he had left part of his Men, together with the <HI>Symerons,</HI> but upon his ar|rival, to his great grief, found his Brother, and one <HI>Richard Allen,</HI> Dead of the Wounds they received in attempting to Board a <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Ship of con&s;iderable force. Nor was this all the lo&s;s, for <HI>Jo|&s;eph Drake,</HI> another of the Captains Brothers, &s;oon after Dyed of a Calenture; yet he took Courage, and being &s;upplyed by the <HI>Syme|rons,</HI> he attended his better Fortune, and was &s;oon after informed by tho&s;e People (who like Grey-hounds ranged the Country to learn what they could) that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet was arrived at <HI>Nombre de Dois;</HI> whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Lyon</HI> Frigat to di&s;cry them, who upon her approaching that Port, fell in with a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>

<P>Vpon certain notice that the Fleet was arrived, <HI>Drake</HI> confered with the Native <HI>Symerons,</HI> about the Nece&s;&s;aries that were to be provided for the expedition, to &s;urprize &s;uch Carriages of Gold and Silver, as were to come over-Land; who told him he mu&s;t be well furni&s;hed with Weapons and Shooes, and that for the re&s;t they would not be wanting; which being provided, <HI>48</HI> Men &s;et forward, of which, <HI>30</HI> were <HI>Symerons,</HI> and the re&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the former &s;erving in|&s;tead of <HI>Sumpterers</HI> for carrying Provi&s;ion, and when the &s;tore fail|ed, they would range the Woods, and catch &s;uch Provi&s;ion as they could, &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ing to return without a Buck or Faun, or &s;tore of Foul, bearing about them many Arrows, headed with Iron, Wood, or Fi&s;hes Bones; which they will ca&s;t &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that they &s;eldome mi&s;s the Iron, with which their Arrows are headed, and is frequently found to be more precious in their e&s;timation, than Gold.</P>
<P>This March they continued over-Land through many thick Woods, from Sun-ri&s;e, till ten in the Morning, and then re&s;ting in watery places till four in the Afternoon, they walked till eight; and when Darkne&s;s came on, the <HI>Symerons</HI> laying a&s;ide their burthens, would cut down Boughs to build Harbours with, covering them to keep out the Rain, if any &s;hould fall, building them with <HI>Planata</HI> Leaves, decent-wi&s;e according to the Fa&s;hion of <HI>Norway</HI> Cottages; in&s;omuch that no Rain would enter for the &s;pace of <HI>24</HI> hours; nor were they wanting to bring &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits, as <HI>Mammeas, Guyanas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Le|mons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HI></P>

After pa&s;&s;ing many Gloomy Woods, which &s;heltered them from the Suns hot Beams, they came to a great Hill, on which &s;tood a high Tree, in which were cut &s;everal &s;teps, that led to a plea&s;ant Bower, &s;cituate on the top, in which, ten or twelve Men might &s;it, and from thence take a view of the North and South <HI>Athantick</HI> Ocean; and from thence they pa&s;&s;ed on to a plain Champain Country, abounding in Gra&s;s &s;o high, that the Inhabi|tants are obliged to burn it twice or thrice a Year, to give their Catle advantage of feeding; through which they Travelled to <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> and for fear of being di&s;covered, &s;truck through a Gloomy Grove, on the Right-hand, and at the edge thereof re&s;ting: they &s;ent a <HI>Symeron</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed like a <HI>Negro,</HI> to <HI>Panama,</HI> to inquire what Night, for by Day they Travelled? not by rea&s;on of the heat of the Sun.

<P>Matters being at this pa&s;s, it was not thought &s;afe to &s;tay long in tho&s;e parts, but to return to the Ships, which they could not do, but by the tedious way they came, or by cutting their way through <HI>Venta-Cruz,</HI> the latter of which as le&s;s difficult. <HI>Drake</HI> re&s;olved on, and therefore commanding his Men to refre&s;h them&s;elves, ask|ed <HI>Pedro,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> whether he would &s;tand by him or not? who an&s;wered, He would Dye at his Feet, e're he would leave him; and thereupon on they marched, till they cam near the Town, and there taking out of the <HI>Recoes</HI> what was be&s;t Porta|ble, they turned back the Moiles and their Drivers, commanding them on pain of Death, not to follow them: and &s;entering the way, cut through a thick Wood, as thick as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hedges, they were incountered by a company of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> under the leading of a <HI>Convent Fryer;</HI> when after a hot skirmi&s;h (in which <HI>John Har|ris,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> and one <HI>Symeron,</HI> were killed, the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> were put to flight, many of them being killed, wounded, and taken Pri&s;oners; The <HI>Symerons</HI> at that time behaving them|&s;elves

<P>Thus the chief ends, for which the Iourney was undertaken, be|ing unluckily fru&s;trated, <HI>Drake</HI> (after a tedious March, in which many of his Men had peri&s;hed by hunger and thir&s;t, had not the <HI>Sy|merons</HI> proved their Purveyors) arrived to his Ships; tho&s;e on Board, who before were in great heavyne&s;s for his ab&s;ence, abun|dantly rejoycing at his return; and &s;o &s;taying on board in the Ri|ver <HI>Fortugos,</HI> for &s;ome time a con&s;ult was held, what Enterprize was next to be undertaken, in which the Opinion of <HI>Symerons</HI> was held nece&s;&s;ary, as they who be&s;t knew the Country, and where the Trea&s;ure lay; who gave Council, that near a Town, called <HI>Veragna,</HI> lived one <HI>Senior Pezaro;</HI> who had formerly been Ma&s;ter to &s;ome of them, and whom for his cruelty, they had abandoned; And that this Man, in a &s;trong Store-hou&s;e, Guarded by <HI>100</HI> Slaves, had heaped up great Trea&s;ure, being Propriator of &s;everal

Whereupon the Captain giving &s;uch of the <HI>Symerons</HI> (who were willing thereto) leave to depart, gifting them with many large gifts, he took the re&s;t with their Cap|tain on Board, and &s;et Sail to &s;eize on this &s;o much de&s;ired Prize; But entering the Harbour, although it was yet Dark, he under|&s;tood by the Firing of &s;everal Chambers, which wer an&s;wered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> others a di&s;tance thence, that he was di&s;covered, and the Wind rur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing again&s;t him, he thought it not fit to attempt any thing further in that matter.
