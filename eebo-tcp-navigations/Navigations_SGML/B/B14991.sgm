<P>_SOme few dayes agoe the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> &s;ent certaine Compa|nies towards <HI>Mastricht</HI> to cro&s;&s;e there the Ri|ver of the <HI>Maye,</HI> as if they &s;houlde haue marcht towards the <HI>Rhine,</HI> keeping never|thele&s;&s;e the greate&s;t parts of his forces in <HI>Brabant,</HI> as if they were to follow the other but that was not his intent.</P>
<P>Satterday, Sunday, and Munday, there was given order to goe towards <HI>Mae&s;eyck,</HI> onely to deceiue the forces of the <HI>States.</HI></P>

<P>The Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> vnder&s;tanding this gaue command that the <HI>States</HI> hor&s;e in <HI>Bra|bant,</HI> &s;hould ride to <HI>Bommelerwaert,</HI> and <HI>Nim|wegen,</HI> little thinking what was the &s;cope of the enemies.

<P>The Leaders after a little deliberation, con|de&s;cended all pre&s;ently to his advi&s;e, not|with&s;tanding the command of the Prince
<PB N="3" REF="3">of <HI>Orange.</HI> As &s;oone as they were return'd in their Garri&s;on, they vnder&s;tood, that the Spani&s;h Forces, twelue thou&s;and &s;trong, marched towards the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wowe:</HI> And vpon the 18. of Iuly, the&s;e of <HI>Steen berghen</HI> perceived that their Towne was to be be&s;ieged, being vnawares, and vnprovided of many things nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;taine a &s;iege, &s;eeing it is a place of no great importance. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Borwater</HI> Go|vernour of the place, being a braue Souldi|er, was much di&s;contented with this Newes, &s;eeing he wanted both men and Munition, having but one peece of Ordi|nance in the Towne, and that vn&s;ervicea|ble, layd before the Ho&s;pitall without the appurtenances. It is certaine, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> few dayes before the &s;iege, &s;ent thether a Gunner, and had given charge to a Commi&s;&s;ioner to convay thether fiue or &s;ix Cannons, but what&s;oever the cau&s;e is, it was not performed: And the Women of the Towne much di&s;contented with the &s;ayd Commi&s;&s;ioner, would haue ca&s;t him the afore&s;ayd Munday (being the 18. of Iuly) into the water; the &s;aid day about
<PB N="4" REF="4">noone is the enemy come &s;o neere to the Towne, that their voyces might be heard by the Garri&s;on, and turn'd pre&s;ently their Ordinance, and di&s;charged the &s;ame a|gain&s;t the Towne, not having made any Battery.</P>
<P>And having made a rea&s;onable bigge breach in the walles with &s;ixtie Cannon &s;hot, the Inhabitants began to looke hea|vie, the rather becau&s;e they had not heard of late the noy&s;e of &s;uch Heath Crickets. A few houres before, went a great number of women and children, crying and lamen|ting, out of the Towne; which was cer|tainely a pittifull &s;pectacle to beholde.</P>
<P>What concernes the cryes and laments heard by me, as well of tho&s;e that were within as without <HI>Tertolen,</HI> the <HI>C'limder</HI> and the <HI>Plaet.</HI> I will not &s;peake of, they carry away all what they will not loo&s;e.</P>
<P>I could more liuely Relate how they cry and lament, and wring their hands toge|ther, the one, for her husband, the other, for her childe, leaping in and out the boats (&s;aying) that they will remayne, where fle&s;h and bloud is lo&s;t, goods are not re|membered
<PB N="5" REF="4">in &s;uch ca&s;es. In tho&s;e places where the&s;e things happen, there is no di&s;puting whether they be Papi&s;ts, Prote&s;tants, or Armi|nians, but mu&s;t ioyntly re&s;i&s;t the inva&s;ion of the enemies.</P>
<P>On thur&s;day the 19. of Iuly did the enemies &s;end a Trumpet to the Towne, to aske whe|ther they would Parley. That otherwi&s;e, his Forces &s;tanding readie in Battell array, &s;hould a&s;&s;ault the towne where the breach was made. Declaring moreover, that they would not de|part from thence before they had brought the Towne vnder the obedience of the King of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>The valiant Governour <HI>Borwater,</HI> with two Captaines, and the Gentlemen of their Com|panies, and &s;ome of the Magi&s;trats of the place, re&s;olved to keepe the Towne, vntill the la&s;t man, for the <HI>States.</HI> But they reque&s;ted the Trumpet, that he would try whether the ene|mies would conde&s;cend to a ce&s;&s;ation of Armes for few houres onely; wherevpon, he returned pre&s;ently to <HI>Don Lewis de V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">yco,</HI> and the Governour of <HI>Antwerpe.</HI></P>
<P>In the meane time, they &s;ent &s;ome to looke whether they could not &s;ee (&s;tanding vpon the Steeple) any Shippes comming with ayde.
<PB N="6" REF="5">But afterwards, &s;eeing that the enemy divided his Forces in three &s;everall Troopes, to a&s;&s;ault the towne in divers places, and that they were not able to defend the &s;ame, &s;eeing it had no Countre&s;carps, or Bulwarkes, but onely cer|taine round Towers of no &s;trength. And like|wi&s;e in con&s;ideration of the lamentations of women and Cittizens which had any thing to loo&s;e, they could not re&s;olue almo&s;t what to doe. And to &s;peake the truth, there was no o|ther i&s;&s;ue to be expected, then that the Souldi|ers, and armed Cittizens, &s;hould be &s;laine, as al&s;o all the re&s;t, and all their goods pillaged, and made havock off.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame in&s;tant, the Trumpet being re|turned, told them that the enemy would not grant them as much as the &s;pace of an houre. But if they would &s;urrender the Towne, they &s;hould haue good conditions, and be well v|&s;ed, otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t doe as the cau&s;e &s;hould require.</P>
<P>The Governour was vnwilling to yeeld, but mo&s;t Voyces carryed away, and agreed vpon the&s;e following Conditions and Articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the Souldiers with their Armes and Armour, be&s;ides Baggage &s;hould depart, and be conducted with a &s;afe Convoy.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P N="2">2. That the Towne&s;men &s;hould pay two thou&s;and Gilders (which is 200.^l^i^. Sterling) to the Souldiers, to hinder their pillaging.</P>
<P N="3">3. That all the Towne&s;men after the afore|&s;aid money is payd, &s;hall haue libertie to de|part with their goods where they li&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. That tho&s;e that would remaine there, and liue according to their Lawes, Cu&s;tomes, and Ceremonies, they might, and &s;hould be v&s;ed as other Inhabitants of the obey&s;ant Citties and Townes of <HI>Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon the&s;e conditions is the Towne &s;urren|dered the afore&s;aid Munday before noone be|ing the 19. of Iuly. The Governour had like|wi&s;e leaue to convay his goods away. Within the Towne were two Companies, an old and a new, both of <HI>Alekmar,</HI> &amp; behaved them&s;elues very valiantly.</P>
<P>At their departure there was a woman that philipping vpon her thumbe, told to &s;ome of the Souldiers, now you mu&s;t foorth and our friends &s;hall come in.</P>
<P>This Towne was be&s;et with 9. Companies, and one Captaine <HI>Det</HI> (who did lie in former time vpon the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wowe,</HI> and is very skil|full in pillaging, wherefore the Countrey peo|of the <HI>Climder, Stryen,</HI> and the <HI>Plaet</HI> may looke to

<P>At the Haven not farre from the Towne, is the Enemie ray&s;ing a Fort compelling both Cittizens and Souldiers to labour at it.</P>
<P>They haue likewi&s;e put their boats to the water, which they haue gotten thither by wag gons, intending to trouble the Navigation be|twixt <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Sealand.</HI> But our Mariners and Saylers wilbe very glad to meete with them.</P>
<P>As &s;oone as the enemy had his garri&s;on plan|ted in the Towne, he &s;ent his forces towards <HI>Berghen vp Zoom,</HI> but 2. Leagues from thence, the hor&s;e were conducted by <HI>Don Lewis de Vela&s;|co,</HI> and the foote by the Governour of <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> marching &s;o in all ha&s;t to the &s;ayd Citty, and being arrived there, planted their Ordinance not farre off, thinking to &s;peede as they did at <HI>Steene-berghen,</HI> having notice that the Hor&s;e in garri&s;on were abroad.</P>
<P>And towards the Evening they thought to &s;urpri&s;e the horne-workes, or the great out|workes neere Saint <HI>Quirin;</HI> But the Governour <HI>Rhyhoven</HI> did hid him&s;elfe in the &s;ayd outworks commanding the Ordinance and all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary to bee made readie again&s;t their ap|proach. which being perceived, the Ordinance
<PB N="9" REF="6">was pre&s;ently di&s;playd again&s;t them, and our foote went to meete them, crying, kill, kill, kil, and after the &s;ound of the Trumpet, our hor&s;e likewi&s;e &s;et vpon the Enemies, pur&s;uing them in &s;uch maner vnto their Cannon, that a great &s;laughter was made among&s;t them, and if the garri&s;on had beene well &s;econded and refre&s;h|ed, they would haue carried it away, or other|wi&s;e nayled the &s;ame to make it vn&s;ervi&s;eable: at our retreat the hor&s;e of the enemy prepared them&s;elues to &s;et vpon our garri&s;on, but our Ordinance planted vpon the wals, cau&s;ed both men and hor&s;es to cut capers in the ayre wher|by there ro&s;e &s;uch an Alarum with crying and lamenting among&s;t them, that it &s;eemed that every one was hurt that came neere, them. In &s;uch maner they haue beene twi&s;e or thri&s;e re|&s;concerned, and if they like it well they may come againe</P>
<P>But they di&s;liking much this dan&s;e, retyred pre&s;ently a quarter of a myle, they tooke their men which were &s;laine along with them and rancked them in the &s;and, &s;aying the&s;e feare no more the <HI>Flamencos.</HI> In the meane time tho&s;e of the city &s;pare no charges to fortifie them&s;elues, having pierced likewi&s;e the Beare of the newe worke neare the Haven.</P>
