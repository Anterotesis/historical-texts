<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentle Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BEcau&s;e I &s;ee, that the generall <HI>Cur|rantos</HI> coming weekely ouer, haue rather &s;tifled their owne credites, then giuen &s;atisfaction vnto the world; and that yet men throng as fa&s;t to heare Newes, as they beyond the Seas throng ouer, and huddle together all manner of things to plea&s;e the people, both here and el&s;e-where; I could not chu&s;e but take pitty of their longings and de&s;ires, that are truly affectionate to Religion, and the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and &s;o expo&s;e vnto thee, who&s;oeuer thou art, this Relation of credite, which came to my hands the twelfth of Aprill, wherein you &s;hall &s;ee a mode&s;t declaration of the affaires of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the tumultuous pro|ceedings of &s;uch <HI>Princes,</HI> as either wi&s;h well to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> or &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elues wronged by the Emperours imperiou&s;ne&s;&s;e, and <HI>Bauariaes</HI> ambitious ha&s;tine&s;&s;e to v&s;urpe anothers inheritance, and &s;o I fall to the matter, as I finde it thus written.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>I will not trouble you, my &s;elfe, nor contrarious humors; yea &s;uch poore Papi&s;ticall Newes-mon|gers, that will haue <HI>Sluce</HI> lo&s;t, and <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> &s;laine before euer they were in danger, with former repe|titions of matters already publi&s;hed, nor once di&s;|pute of the motiues, cau&s;es, effects, alterations, or any other circum&s;tances of the warres, eyther in <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> or the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> but come roundly to the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and tell you what is now a doing, and what is likely to follow.</P>
<P>Euer &s;ince the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> beganne to repine at <HI>Bauariaes</HI> intru&s;ion into the honour of the&s;e acti|ons, and the Emperour &s;eemed partially affected to his &s;eruice, many Princes mi&s;liked the &s;ame, and by way of commi&s;eration thought it too much, that the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> &s;hould be vtterly ouerthrowne; and therefore, as you haue participated out of diuers Di&s;cour&s;es, they haue recollected them&s;elues, and thus proceeded toward his reliefe and &s;upportation: whereas it hath beene fir&s;t generally reported, that <HI>Hungaria</HI> is reduced to the Emperours iuri&s;diction, and that a League of Amitie hath beene contracted betweene him, and <HI>Bethelem Gabor;</HI> there is no &s;uch matter, but rather the contrary. For the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;iluania</HI> calling the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> Go&s;&s;ip, by rea&s;on he had chri&s;tned him a childe; hath prote&s;ted neuer to for&s;ake him, till he &s;ee him one way or an|other re-e&s;tabli&s;hed: Indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e he hath ab&s;tained from crowning him&s;elfe king of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> vpon a certaine vow, he would neuer be inue&s;ted, till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> garri&s;ons and Emperors forces were put out of Rub, <HI>Camora</HI> &amp; other places: yea till <HI>Pre&s;hurgh</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">it &s;elfe were taken and cleered.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Ieggendorff</HI> keeping the fields and villages of <HI>Morauia</HI> for the v&s;e of the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> cleane contrary to the feare and di|&s;tre&s;&s;e he hath bene put in by the Emperours forces, hath giuen him &s;euerall defeates, and approoued him&s;elfe a faithfull friend and &s;eruitor.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the repinings of <HI>Prague,</HI> and &s;ome other townes, which are &s;till vnder the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> protection haue bene greater again&s;t the Emperour and his forces of late dayes, then euer before.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Duke of <HI>Wittenberg,</HI> &s;carce named in other Relations, hauing mu&s;tered &s;ome forces for the defence of his Countrey, and commaunded by the Emperour to vnite them to <HI>Bauaria,</HI> hath an|&s;wered plainely, That as they are mu&s;tered by the aduice of his Coun&s;ell and Lords, they are likewi&s;e to be di&s;po&s;ed by them, who neuer had occa&s;ion of vnkindnes with the <HI>Palatine,</HI> and therefore will not now beginne.</P>
<P>Fiftly, the Princes of the Vnion perceiuing what a fearefull thing it is to let an enemy &s;et footing in an others Countrey, e&s;pecially to fortifie him&s;elfe, as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath done in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> are generall repiners at their owne fir&s;t &s;lackene&s;&s;e, and &s;o re&s;olue to recouer their much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed honours by &s;ome new and glorious attempts in behalfe of their friend and confederate.</P>
<P>Sixtly, the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Boden,</HI> and <HI>Lant&s;graue</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> &s;tanding hitherto, as it were, at a &s;tay, though they euer had good harts, wil now draw their friend together, and be &s;eene in the field.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>Seuenthly, the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> comming but fir&s;t into the Low countries, to &s;alute the Queene of <HI>Bohemia</HI> at the <HI>Hage,</HI> offered them his &s;eruice, and was not onely accepted, but &s;upplied with men and mo|ney by the <HI>Sluces,</HI> and &s;o went directly into <HI>We&s;tpha|lia,</HI> and by degrees like a ball of &s;now waxed bigger and bigger, &amp; increa&s;ed his forces, &s;o that he attemp|ted the Dioces of <HI>Cullen,</HI> &amp; proceeded in many glo|rioue actions which you haue heard of, and which haue indeed made him renowned ouer the world.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> though &s;ome vnkind|ne&s;&s;e at the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed between the Prince of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> and him, and all for the loue of the King of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> hath yet pro&s;pered &s;o well, that he came round about the countries, &amp; performed &s;uch actions of admira|tions, that there are few kingdomes of <HI>Europe,</HI> which haue not bin filled with the relations of his proceed|ings, and euer memorable exploites, &s;o that he hath reduced diuers Prouinces vnder his obedience, and now &s;tands like a worke impregnable with a mighty army and mo&s;t willing heart to &s;et forward the king of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> de&s;ignes.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are in the general thus &s;et downe to &s;hew you the cau&s;e, why the Emperor without con|trouer&s;ie is weary of the warre, and &s;u&s;pects that his friends wil neuer be able to with&s;tand &s;o great forces &amp; men exa&s;perated euery where again&s;t him, not &s;o much for his owne cau&s;e, and great &s;pirit in main|taining his honour &amp; renowne, as hearkening to the <HI>Sirens</HI> &s;ongs of the Ie&s;uites, who in trueth care ney|ther for him, nor any Prince what&s;oeuer, nor for the &s;laughter of the people, di&s;turbance of their gouern|ments,

<P>I will now go forward to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in hand, which depends on the actions of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;|wicke,</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who haue beene in pre|&s;ent imployment, euen &s;ince the Emperors Amba&s;|&s;adour went into <HI>England,</HI> and mo&s;t wonderfully &s;et forward the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> affaires, &s;o that as far as men may be confident of worldly computation, ther is great hope of recouery, &amp; turning of fortunes wheele, that he may be brought at la&s;t to the toppe, which hath &s;o long beene kept with his head downe|ward: &s;o that to make the matter more per&s;picuous, I mu&s;t &s;ay with the Poet; <HI>arma viro&s;qne cuno,</HI> and tell you fir&s;t, what the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> hath done, &amp; next, how Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath proceeded.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> he hath long &s;ince bin in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Patter-horne, We&s;tphalia,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop|ricke of <HI>Cullen,</HI> wherein his progre&s;&s;es haue had won|derfull &s;ucce&s;&s;e, as by the preuailing in many skirmi|&s;hes may appeare, &s;o that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cullen</HI> being the duke of <HI>Bauariaes</HI> brother, hath diuers times ad|uerti&s;ed the Emperor and the re&s;t of his friends, what di&s;tre&s;&s;e he hath bene in, and is likely to endure, if he
<PB N="6" REF="5">be not better releeued, whereupon many by <HI>Bauari|aes</HI> appoyntment haue come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, namely <HI>Mon&s;ieur Iilley, Gonzales;</HI> another Prince of <HI>Anhalt</HI> and the Gouernor of <HI>Gulick,</HI> all which haue &s;undry times skirmi&s;hed with the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> and as you haue heard in as &s;undry Relations could ne|uer boa&s;t of preuailing, no not of equality in their encounters, but departed &s;til with lo&s;&s;e on their &s;ide, while the&s;e skirmi&s;hes had their &s;euerall pa&s;&s;ages; Newes came vnto him of the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> de|parture from the <HI>Hage</HI> &s;ecretly in the company of &s;ir <HI>Francis Nether&s;oll,</HI> and &s;ir <HI>Charles Morgane,</HI> two Engli&s;h Knights, and eight other: &s;ome tolde him, that all his tents, armour and proui&s;ion of the warre were &s;hipped at <HI>Enchy&s;en</HI> to goe to <HI>Bream,</HI> or &s;ome other rendezuous nearer to him&s;elfe, and the places he meant to goe vnto; &s;ome di&s;cour&s;ed of diuer&s;e men of warre which attended him, as though hee re|&s;olued for <HI>Denmarke,</HI> but others &s;eemed to vnder|&s;tand the truth indeed, and a&s;&s;ured him he was gone di&s;gui&s;ed from <HI>Calis</HI> to <HI>Sedan,</HI> to vi&s;ite the old duke of <HI>Bolloigne,</HI> and there to acquaint Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> with his intent, and purpo&s;es, and receiue from him and &s;ir <HI>Horatio Vere,</HI> a true Certificate of the e&s;tate of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and the army, and &s;o either to ex|&s;pect a Conuoy to meete with Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> or march with the whole army into &s;om other country.</P>
<P>When the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> heard of this, he forthwith be&s;tirred him&s;elfe, and &s;et his actions on their be&s;t feete, that hee might be ready to attend the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> where&s;oeuer hee went; and thus he preuailed in many &s;euerall encounters tooke

<P>Fir&s;t, while he was re&s;ident in <HI>Mun&s;terland,</HI> and had according to the chaunce of warre, and cu&s;tome of Souldiers, pillaged the Villages, and &s;poyled the Inhabitants, two &s;euerall Ie&s;uites &s;pared for no in|uectiues again&s;t him, but railed in their Sermons, &amp; in euery Pulpit where they preached, mi&s;-termed him wor&s;e then a tyrant, bloud-&s;ucker, and traytor, thundering again&s;t him cur&s;es and damnation; yea cur&s;ing all his partakers and enterpri&s;es, whereupon the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> thus exa&s;perated, proiected how to be reuenged, and yet would faine do it with|out &s;hedding of bloud; whereupon he &s;ent a me&s;|&s;enger for them, whom they denied, and added <HI>Elias</HI> prayers for fire from heauen to con&s;ume the <HI>Captains</HI> of fifty: then he &s;ent certaine troups to &s;urpri&s;e them, who tooke them in a manner of an Ambu&s;cado, and brought them before him; whereupon hee that was mo&s;t faulty, kneeled downe, and importuned him to pardon his offence, and &s;aue his life: at which <HI>Brun&s;|wicke</HI> &s;miled &amp; an&s;wered; that his life would do him no good, but he would make &s;ome &s;port with him to cheere his hart: &amp; thus prouing inexorable, he com|manded certaine officers to &s;trip him naked, &amp; drop him all ouer with pitch and tarre, keeping him &s;til by a warm fire, that it might be moi&s;t vpon him, &amp; then

<PB REF="8">a 1000. hor&s;e was newly come to him out of <HI>Ea&s;t-Free&s;land</HI> and <HI>North-Holland,</HI> vnder the com|mand of Captain <HI>Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hon&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Hage,</HI> with cer|taine other &s;ouldiers, who all prepared them&s;elues to fight with this new commer, the forenamd Prince of <HI>Anholt,</HI> who greedy of honour, and willing to rank him&s;elfe in the Catalogue of famous Captaines, came brauely vpon that battaile, wherein the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> was fronted, nor was this ra&s;hly done, or as I may &s;ay in &s;pleene and fury, but vpon great adui&s;e and deliberation. For be&s;ides the <HI>Carbines</HI> that charged mo&s;t violently, the Battalion was flan|ked with Musketeers, who powred their &s;hot into <HI>Brun&s;wickes</HI> battailes, and had the fortune to kill &s;ome of his men. For this was done &s;o brauely, that his troopes were driuen to recoyle, and vpon that &s;taggering many thought he was &s;laine: for his hor&s;e was &s;hot vnder him, and in that ama&s;e the people ru|moured his death.</P>
<P>This was a hard beginning, and put the &s;ouldiers in a &s;hrewd feare: For a whole Cornet of hor&s;e was &s;hiuered, and <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> lay for the time vnder foot, but it la&s;ted not long: for his youth and courage got the victory of a&s;toni&s;hment, and vp he gets, and vp he mounts againe, fir&s;t cau&s;ing the Captaines to to fill vp the roome with a body of pikes, who kept the enemies hor&s;e from comming too forward: then did he charge them with fre&s;h hor&s;e, and ere they could wheele about to bring their pi&s;tols bulleted he put them all to rowt, and &s;o was quittance with them for their fir&s;t branery: but taking another bo|dy of pikes, and finding the enemies Battalion &s;ome|what

<PB N="12" REF="9">winde of many Bullets made him fall once againe from his hor&s;e, in&s;o much that a <HI>Wallon</HI> Captaine (as it was reported) &s;tepped vnto him, &s;uppo&s;ing to take him pri&s;oner, but as he was lame in body, his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e &s;ucceeded as lamely: for to preuent the mi&s;chiefe, one <HI>Remigius</HI> a <HI>Dane</HI> oppo&s;ed the lame Captaine, and in the &s;ight of the armies &s;lue him outright, hauing thereby time to fetch vp <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> hor&s;e, and comfort to &s;ee him a liue, and vnhurt.</P>

<P>This is that, which is written of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> proceedings, but would I had time to write more: For he is a worthy Gentleman, and re|&s;olute Souldier, their lackes but &s;ome yeares to ma|ture his iudgement, and bring the&s;e good begin|nings to pro&s;perous ends, of which there is no doubt.

<P N="2">2 Concerning the Earle of <HI>Mansfield</HI> and his &s;trong Army, many remarkable things are written, which as briefly as I can I will &s;uccinctly abreuiate into the&s;e heads. 1. Fir&s;t, that vnder&s;tanding, that all the Catholick Bi&s;hops were fled, hee gari&s;oned
<PB N="14" REF="10">mo&s;t of Army in their &s;trong holds, and quartred them in the Villages, whereby as they &s;ay in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> they had Mini&s;trels fare, meate, drinke, and money. 2. Secondly, that when he perceiued his Army to encrea&s;e, and now to be &s;o &s;trong, that the Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> looke vpon him with repining eyes, as wondering to what purpo&s;e he taketh &s;uch large &s;teps ouer the Catholick Countries, he made a defence or Apologie, diuulging it in the French tongue, and deliuered the Po&s;t of <HI>England, Balam</HI> by name, one of them to carie ouer with him. 3. Third|ly, that vnder&s;tanding of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> conflicts, hee writ Letters of gratification, and not onely applauded his actions, but reque&s;ted a certificate from his owne hands, who returned an|&s;were, how he had preuailed in many skirmi&s;hes: burnt <HI>We&s;terkotton, Erquetts, Amruth,</HI> one of the <HI>Ge|&s;ecks, Ruden, Vberhagen,</HI> and the <HI>Dio&s;arts</HI> hou&s;e of <HI>Werdell</HI> come from <HI>Lip&s;tat,</HI> wherein hee had like to haue beene betrayed with 25. Cornets of Horie, 6000. Foot, diuers Peeces of Ordnance, Fireworks, &s;caling Ladders, and many Pyoners: vpon a de|&s;igne of importance out, he &s;uddenly heard of the approach of the Bi&s;hops forces, and &s;o was com|pelled to &s;tay and augment his Army, for a more fiercer encounter: and that he had taken &s;ome pri|&s;oners, and &s;ome Friers, who were &s;o ob&s;tinate, that they cryed out vpon nothing but trea&s;on and re|bellion. 4. Fourthly, that while hee was at <HI>Germe|&s;hem,</HI> and retired to many places with his maine Ar|mie, Sir <HI>Horace Vere</HI> writing for &s;ome &s;upplies, hee
<PB N="15" REF="10">&s;ent to <HI>Mainhem</HI> foure Regiments of foot, &s;ome money, and munition, be&s;ides many &s;uppliments of victuall, and other proui&s;ion, whereof the Gari|&s;on there &s;tood in great neede. For in truth thus it was with the Engli&s;h Generall at this time, all the forces hee had were partly &s;ecured in <HI>Main|hem, Franckendale,</HI> and <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> partly Gari&s;o|ned in the Villages, and partly running vp and downe for &s;orraging, and other proui&s;ion: &s;o that euery day in one place or other, hee was troubled with the Bauarians, and Mon&s;ieurs <HI>Tillyes</HI> Alarums, who&s;e Souldiers might wel be called the Regiment <HI>Voluntes:</HI> For they neuer lay long quiet in a place, but had many imployments, as <HI>Bauaria</HI> vnder&s;tood of the Enemies proceedings, and Emperours plea|&s;ure, whereupon &s;u&s;pecting what they might doe vpon aduantage, he &s;ent to Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and was &s;upplied accordingly: For without contro|uer&s;ie, he ca&s;t vp his accounts in this manner. That my Lord <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> was long a comming with &s;up|ply into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> but leaue the care of that to the Maie&s;tie of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; that if the Spaniards and Bauarians &s;hould be remoued by way of rendition of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> or co~po&s;ition for a peace, yet God knowes what might happen ere the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e were fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the peace ab&s;olutely con|cluded vpon: wherefore to &s;trengthen him&s;elfe, and to be informed of the &s;tate of all affaires, he writ to Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> as you haue heard, and had not onely &s;upply, but Letters of comfort concerning his re&s;olution, to continue con&s;tant to the Prince
<PB N="16" REF="11">his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fiftly, that as he had fortified <HI>Haggenaw,</HI> hee would come and be&s;iege <HI>Lodenburg,</HI> and &s;o prepare if neede be again&s;t <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> all which hee meant to doe with the third part of his forces: For he was per&s;waded if the wor&s;t came, no further &s;upply would enter into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> either from the Spaniard or Emperour, con&s;idering it was vnfur|ni&s;hed, and that <HI>Gonzules</HI> lay quiet, as if he had had a charge to fight no more. Befides wants &s;o encrea|&s;ed, that the Countrey was not able to &s;u&s;taine an Army on any &s;ide. For the Engli&s;h were hardly driuen, and hardly releeued. <HI>Gonzales</HI> had beene put to the triall of eating his hor&s;es: Mon&s;ieur <HI>Til|ley</HI> perplexed with hunger &amp; &s;euerall imployment, &s;o that he had &s;carce 5000. men left, and they &s;ub|iect to &s;ickne&s;&s;e, and other encombrances. The Ba|uarians in the &s;ame predicarment vexed with &s;ick|ne&s;&s;e and cold, although the Emperour had hether|to &s;ent many helpes, and renewed their decayed Souldiers: and the Townes, though the riuers brought in proui&s;ion, becau&s;e the Country people were rea&s;onably payed, yet felt the &s;carcity: For victuals grew deere in the Market, and the Burgers were glad to keepe good order without ryot or ex|ce&s;&s;e: yea, in many places Officers were &s;et, as &s;u|perui&s;ours, that neither the rich engro&s;&s;ed the Corne, Wine, nor meat, nor the poore &s;hould be &s;tarued for want of nece&s;&s;aries. The&s;e things con|&s;idered, hee tooke the more care in comming for|ward, and pe&s;tring the Countrey with his forces to
<PB N="17" REF="11">no purpo&s;e, but in my con&s;cience made acquain|ted with the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> retiring, he prepared to &s;peake with him, and &s;o to attend to bring their bu&s;ine&s;&s;e to &s;ome perfection, as God &s;hall giue way vnto the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="6">6. Sixthly, that &s;eeing he had vi&s;ited <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> all this Winter, and was in a manner Ma&s;ter of <HI>Leo|paldus</HI> his Countrey, he would &s;ure keepe what hee had gotten, and therefore as the Spaniard had taught him, and led the way in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> hee would fortifie the &s;tronge&s;t places, and when all failed, put the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> in many po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Prouinces for his owne <HI>Palatinate,</HI> if not &s;et the Crowne of <HI>Prague</HI> more firmely on his head, then ouer it was before.</P>
<P N="7">7. Seuenthly, that &s;eeing his endeuours had put him in a manner in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of foure Imperiall Cities, namely, <HI>Haggenaw, Spires, Wormes,</HI> and <HI>Ments,</HI> and that hee had brought them to the di&s;|bur&s;ement of what money he li&s;ted, he &s;aw no rea|&s;on to let &s;lip &s;uch opportunity, but either keepe them in awe by his Armies, or make v&s;e of their &s;euerall Countries, to recompence the King of <HI>Bohemiahs</HI> lo&s;&s;es, vntill a better time approach of better booty, which no doubt was now breaking out with the day to &s;hew, that the Sunne of glory was ready to come out of his Chamber, to di&s;pell and bani&s;h away the contagious vapours of former trouble and di&s;comforts.</P>
<P N="8">8. Eighthly, that when the Emperour, or Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> for the Emperour, by the aduice
<PB N="18" REF="12">of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Collen</HI> had &s;ent vnto him to know, by what authority or in who&s;e name hee either rai|&s;ed, or kept together &s;uch an Army: hee an&s;wered plainely and re&s;olutely, in Gods name, and the Kings, meaning the King of <HI>Bohemia:</HI> whereupon to expre&s;&s;e him&s;elfe accordingly, he contriued this deui&s;e for his En&s;igne, or colours a radiant Sunne in an Azure field, di&s;pelling a many &s;lender and va|porous clouds into a corner: thus hee not onely iu&s;tifies his actions, and emboldneth his Souldiers, but payeth his Army, and hath an orderly Trea&s;u|rer for their monethly entertainment, according to the preyes and &s;poiles they take: yea, to order his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e the better, he is now coyning thou&s;ands of Rikes dollers with this deuice, an arme comming out of a cloud, holding a &s;word poynant vpward, with a Ie&s;uites Cap pierc'd through: the Motto round about, <HI>Amicus dei omnibus &s;uis inimicis inimi|cus.</HI> 9. Ninthly, that although many Friers and o|ther Preachers v&s;ed as many fearefull inuectiues again&s;t the Warre, the cau&s;es, the Authors, and ef|fects, &s;hewing plainly, it was a cur&s;e of God where|&s;oeuer it lighted: yet did he giue way vnto the Sun, as if hee were willing to confe&s;&s;e as much, intima|ting by many of his &s;peeches, that the Emperour, though he had wrong done him fir&s;t by the <HI>Proge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;es:</HI> yet tooke a wrong cour&s;e to inflict the King of <HI>Bohemians</HI> children, with the lo&s;&s;e of their inheri|tance for their Fathers fault: as for their Father, many a Chri&s;tian heart did thinke it reuenge &s;uffi|cient to haue <HI>Prague</HI> &s;urrendred, and to &s;ee the <HI>Pala|tine</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="12">di&s;appointed of the Kingdome, in which hee was crowned and inue&s;ted: but &s;till to haue his Countrey deua&s;ted, the territories depopulated, the Cities terrified with Souldiers: the Vines &s;poi|led, the Woods cut downe, the cattell caried away, and all things &s;ubiect to the robberies of Souldiers, was too grieuous a reuenge, and vnmea&s;urable in|flicting: yet this was not all neither. For be&s;ides the bringing in of &s;trange Nations, and a &s;trange Religion to a religious Countrey, he had by way of donation, enfeoffed another with the &s;ame, not re|membring, what eternall hate might grow hereaf|ter betweene the&s;e two families, when peraduen|ture all the power of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> nor the Empire &s;hould not reconcile them, which things orderly con&s;ide|red with many other dangerous to be publi&s;hed in a triuiall or common di&s;cour&s;e, made his actions the more iu&s;tifiable, con&s;idering the proceedings were &s;o terrible, and although the Ie&s;uites aymed at him in their Sermons, as the Author of tho&s;e fearefull effects, and prodigious calamities, which the be&s;t Warre mu&s;t procure: yet all the world knowes the Spaniards were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ours of the one &s;ide, and <HI>Bauaria</HI> was entred in the other, before euer he &s;et footing therein, or tooke this cour&s;e of the Warres diuer&s;ion, which by Gods grace and fa|uour, who &s;et him on worke, hee would pro&s;ecute as long as life la&s;ted, or the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e hung in &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P N="10">10. Tenthly, that &s;eeing the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> hath fini&s;hed the bridge ouer the Neckar, and cau|&s;ed
<PB N="20" REF="13">diuers Wagons to come that way already with Corne and other proui&s;ion, and that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Til|ley</HI> quartereth him&s;elfe neere <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> as though he meant to be&s;iege the &s;ame, or at lea&s;t tarry the time, till <HI>Bauarias</HI> forces be renewed, that ioyning together, they may performe their worke effectu|ally, whereby it is &s;o giuen out in <HI>England,</HI> and ma|ny are credulous of &s;uch an impo&s;&s;ibility: he is re|&s;olued to &s;hew them no fauour, where&s;oeuer hee come: but as hee hath vi&s;ited <HI>Laudenburg,</HI> and the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> belonging to the Bi|&s;hoprick of <HI>Spires,</HI> he will al&s;o come to <HI>Be&s;sing,</HI> and the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Dan&s;tarrats</HI> Countrey, who was euer an Enemy to the Princes of the Vnion: for feare whereof the people haue already vnfurni&s;ht their fields of their Cattle, and caried their goods into the &s;tronge&s;t holds, at which Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> &s;miles to thinke, that poore Ca&s;tles &amp; Forts &s;hould &s;ecure them, when &s;o many Cities and wel fortified places haue &s;ubmitted to his mercy, and made their attonement with him, yea the other day the Catho|licks about <HI>Spiers</HI> and <HI>Wormes,</HI> &s;eeing the good be|hauiour of his Souldiers, that they neither raui|&s;hed women, nor murthered men, but onely tooke the pilledge of the Countrey, rifled the hou&s;es, the common cu&s;tome, and faire&s;t cour&s;e of a conquering Army, condi&s;cended, and by a ge|nerall con&s;ent agreed to allow him 3000. mea|&s;ures of Corne, 200. Fats of Wine, and 60000. Flo|rines, which though he did not accept of, as a full &s;atisfaction to his demaunds, yet did hee take in
<PB REF="13">good part for the pre&s;ent, and knew that if nece&s;&s;i|ty &s;hould occa&s;ion, they would be drawne to a fur|ther compo&s;ition and disbur&s;ement.</P>
<P>Thus for the time he de&s;i&s;ted from vrging them to more then they were willng to graunt, con&s;ide|ring he had formerly drawne great &s;ummes of mo|ney out of their Trea&s;uries: whereupon he procee|ded to vi&s;ite other Countries, and therein onely to take an oath of the Inhabitants of loyalty and fide|lity to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and &s;eruice and atten|dancie to him&s;elfe, and &s;o he pa&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine</HI> into the Countries of <HI>Didi&s;hene</HI> and <HI>Anoth,</HI> where the people &s;eemed to wi&s;h well vnto the King of Bohemia, and very willingly tooke their Oath: then pa&s;&s;ed hee to the Graue of Louen&s;teins Countrey, which lyeth within the Bi&s;hopricke of Spires, and taking the &s;ame Oath of the inhabitants, he quietly receiued &s;uch proui&s;ion and money, as they would willingly &s;pare: heere hee receiued newes that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilly</HI> had brought his Ordi|nance, or Artillery to a place called Hu&s;charen, as if he meant to goe to Heidelbergh indeed, but he let him alone, as re&s;oluing, that though he had power to his will, yet hee &s;hould not attempt any enter|pri&s;e of worth and moment, without interception: but a&s;&s;ured, that neither Bauaria could proceed in any &s;uch de&s;igne, nor dur&s;t he lying &s;o neare, but let them alone, till he had further directions from him, who~ he longs to &s;peake withall; &s;o that in my Con|&s;cience when that oportunity &s;hal pre&s;ent her hairy &s;oretop vnto him, he will onely march through the

<P N="11">11. Eleauenthly, though he heard, that <HI>Don Cor|dua</HI> in per&s;on was ri&s;en from the Towne of Cru&s;|nach to goe to Openhem, and fortifie the Bridge with Sconces to hinder all pa&s;&s;engers, but &s;uch, whom the Court of Guard &s;hall licen&s;e: yet when he &s;aw he &s;lacked the &s;ame, hee conceiued he had &s;ome &s;peciall charge to proceed no further again&s;t the Engli&s;h, till the Emperours Amba&s;&s;ador were returned, and they knew what to tru&s;t vnto from <HI>England:</HI> So that one way hee found the people glad, that there was any glimmering light of Peace toward, and another way feared it would be a barre vnto his De&s;ignes, if the King of Bohemia &s;hould by any meanes be ouer-ruled, or per&s;waded to ea&s;ie Condition, and tractates of Friend&s;hip: but re&s;ol|ued not to be di&s;turbed with conceit, or meditation of &s;uch bu&s;ines, which yet hung in &s;u&s;pence, or were Coniecturall, he pre&s;ently put him&s;elfe into Acti|on, and ouerlooked his Fortifications and places, wherein he had Garri&s;on'd his Souldiers, and &s;et vp his re&s;t to attend the good houre of further pro|&s;ecutions.</P>
<P N="12">12. Twelthly, it was &s;omewhat vnplea&s;ing vnto him, that his Forces had layne &s;o long before the Ca&s;tle of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">gdenburg,</HI> and &s;pent as hee thought &s;o much time to his di&s;grace, and hindring his other de&s;ignes, whereupon he went thither in per&s;on and
<PB N="23" REF="14">tooke away all meanes from them of &s;uccor and re|liefe, which when they perceiued, and were now debarred from former &s;upportation, being old Sol|diers and of great experience, they came to capitu|late the matter, and &s;urrendred the place vpon Con|dition to &s;aue their liues, and depart with Bag and baggage, which they did without Colours di&s;play|ed, or any &s;how of a Souldier; by which occa&s;ion Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> tooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame, and found therein more wealth, then either he had at Spiers or Wormes: Thus did he preuaile in his ac|tion, and is now Lord of many Countries &amp; holds, attending the good houre of the King of Bohemia's comming to him, or &s;ending for him: and &s;o leaue him to the glory and in the fulnes of ioy, for this la&s;t good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, which hath made him more confi|dent &amp; re&s;olute to ouer&s;way nicer exceptions, and goe forward in his pretences, though as yet he hath not fully expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame concerning particulars.</P>
<P>Hauing thus left Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> in &s;ecurity, full of wealth, Glory, and a&s;&s;urance to bring his purpo|&s;es to a happy period. Let vs now come to other matters, not yet impertinent though not altogether depending vpon the former: You haue heard I am &s;ure by many relations publi&s;hed long &s;ince, that Duke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Lord of El&s;as and Al&s;atia, was in a manner driuen out of his Countrey by the Forces of <HI>Mansfield:</HI> yet prettily &s;alued that wound with this cure, that he went into the Valtolina, as Gene|rall for the King of Spaine, though in his hart he re|pined at &s;uch an V&s;urpation, which was euer belon|ging

Well? heere hee mu&s;tered Soldiers and tooke vp two Regements to &s;upply o|ther Armies, but in the mid&s;t of this iollity, as hee was running away with hopes of recouery or re|uenge: the money which was promi&s;ed him out of Spaine fayled, and he could neither goe forward in that bu&s;ines, nor dur&s;t returne into his owne Coun|trey for feare of greater forces, or more violent op|po&s;ition: But &s;ome report, that the Emperour &s;ent him word, that hee was willing to a generall Peace and for that purpo&s;e had &s;ent Count <HI>Siratzenburg</HI> into England as his Amba&s;&s;ador, and therfore there needed no &s;uch ha&s;tines to giue any cau&s;e of &s;u&s;piti|on, that hee meant not &s;incerely as he profe&s;&s;ed: This treaty of Peace &s;et all humors and di&s;po&s;itions on worke, and the Prouinces were as it detayned between feare and gladnes, what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the &s;ame, as for the <HI>Grizons</HI> &amp; <HI>Swi&s;&s;e?</HI> they &s;hew|ed <HI>Leopoldus</HI> a face of di&s;content euery way, and brought out olde Records, wherein the Kings of France were authentically &s;worne to bee their Pro|tectors, how euer now they &s;lacked the &s;ame, and gaue way to anothers Greatnes, the like might be &s;aid of the Palatinate, Cleue, and other bordering Prouinces vpon the Empire, and confines of Bur|gundy: but times are alterers of mens purpo&s;es, and Kingdomes are eaten out with contraries; &amp; taught
<PB N="27" REF="15">to know a le&s;&s;on of Humiliation, when the Lord of all Kingdomes will admit of other Stewards, then he fir&s;t placed: Thus <HI>Leopoldus</HI> mu&s;t be content to &s;ee another man in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io~ of many of his Townes, and other Prouinces of the Bi&s;hops, a&s;well as the Palatinate was at the &s;ame in&s;tant v&s;urped by &s;tran|gers, and had indeed too many Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other hopes and helpes, that the King of Bohemia hath, the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Ieggendorffe</HI> is not the lea&s;t. For hee mu&s;treth Soldiers dayly both in Sile&s;ia and Morauia, yea hath had &s;upply out of Walachia: and at this houre is doubtfull, whether he &s;hall entertaine the <HI>Tartars</HI> or no, who came both to him and <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> by thou&s;ands, and re&s;olue to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, if need be again&s;t the Emperour, &s;o that there is a great feare in Pre&s;law and Gratz, Cit|ties of Sile&s;ia, what &s;hall become of them, if any al|teration happen: whereupon the Lords and States rai&s;e vp many Forces, fortifie their Citties, prouide men, money, and munition, &s;tand at a &s;tay for their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and doe neither openly warrant the Emperour their ab&s;olute Obedience, nor priuately wi&s;h ill to the King of Bohemia's proceedings, with which kinde of neutrality the Emperor is &s;o di&s;plea|&s;ed, that he imputes the fault to the Duke of <HI>Saxo|nies</HI> negligence, as vnder&s;tanding that many Soul|diers of Saxony, haue bin licen&s;ed to depart home, and the Duke him&s;elfe is weary of the Warre; not|with&s;tanding the&s;e proceedings, and that there is a re&s;traint of the Soldiers fury and violent cu&s;tomes, whereby <HI>Prague</HI> and other places, reduced vnder the
<PB N="26" REF="16">Emperours gouernment, doe yet hope and looke after &s;ome order for their Religion, and profe&s;&s;ion of a good con&s;cience: yet doth the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Prague</HI> proceede mo&s;t violently and cruelly again&s;t the Prote&s;tants, and will not &s;uffer them to profe&s;&s;e publiquely either in Churches, or priuate hou&s;es, any thing again&s;t the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o that eue|ry where the Inhabitants or di&s;contented, and pray to God for the diuer&s;ion of the&s;e mi&s;chiefes, that haue not onely dilacerated the peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> but broken the hearts of poore &s;oules to heare God &s;o prophaned, and euery man in his owne particular terrified.

<PB N="27" REF="16">may be &s;lacked, or that hee will &s;uffer the Inhabi|tants to enioy their owne freedomes, and peace of con&s;cience, to which purpo&s;e they haue procured another Mediator, euen Duke <HI>Weymar</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> his owne kin&s;man, who hath not onely profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elfe a Prote&s;tant, but rai&s;ed two thou&s;and foot, and fiue hundred hor&s;e to ioyne with the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> in his proceedings, not doubting very &s;hortly to be partakers of his glory, as well as of his &s;poiles, and hardly gotten conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Thus are the pure and delicate waters of Eu|ropes peace troubled and bedirtied with the wan|ton flingings of cruell handes: For Warre you &s;ee hath throwne Blood and corrupted Carka&s;&s;es into the Sunne: men haue followed one another with Death and reuenge, and &s;o drenched their &s;tincking feete: Women haue bathed their raui&s;hed bodies and left their pollution behinde them: Souldiers haue wa&s;hed their corrupted woundes, and all &s;orts with one filth or other, haue &s;ought to damme vp the &s;treames, and make the currant (if it were po&s;&s;i|ble, vnpa&s;&s;ible) &s;o that vnle&s;&s;e the &s;tirring waters get the vpper hand, all will be &s;poyled, and if it once come to a &s;tanding poole, it will &s;tinke and putrifie: but the &s;ame God, that &s;ent the Angell to quicken the poole of <HI>Shilo,</HI> that the di&s;ea&s;ed might be cured, the lame re&s;tored, the drop&s;ie healed, the leprous clen&s;ed, &amp; all infection purged, wil when he &s;ees his time, performe the like for vs, by turning
