<HEAD>AN EXACT NARRATIVE OF THE Re&s;olute Attempt and happy Succe&s;s OF A PART OF HIS MAJESTIES FLEET, Under the Conduct of Sir <HI>Robert Holmes,</HI> upon the I&s;les of <HI>Vly</HI> and <HI>Skelling,</HI> on the ninth and tenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1666.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the 29. of <HI>July,</HI> His <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> Fleet, under his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and his Grace the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> weighed an|chor from within &s;ight of <HI>Zealand.</HI> They &s;teered their cour&s;e for the <HI>Vly,</HI> but the winds being contrary, they did not make the I&s;land till the 7. of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> In which time, &s;everal rich &s;hips hapned to get in, which otherwi&s;e had faln into their hands. Being come to
<PB N="4" REF="3">an Anchor, the Generals were informed, that the I&s;lands of <HI>Vly</HI> and <HI>Skelling,</HI> were very ill guarded (notwith&s;tanding there were Store hou&s;es, both for the States and the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Fleets) and riches to a good value; and what did weigh mo&s;t, a con&s;i|derable number of good Merchant-&s;hips, u&s;ually riding there; Upon which, it was re&s;olved by the Generals, that there &s;hould be a &s;peedy attempt made. A Councel of Flag-Officers was call'd; and it was deter|mined there, that it &s;hould be carried on, in manner following, <HI>viz.</HI> That three hund|red men &s;hould be drawn out of each Squa|dron, con&s;i&s;ting of two parts Land-men, and the third Sea-men; the&s;e to be com|manded by nine Captains, their Names as followeth, Sir <HI>Robert Holmes</HI> Rere-Ad|miral of the Red, to command in chief, Sir <HI>Philip Howard,</HI> to command one hundred and twenty Volunteers, Captain <HI>John Bel|la&s;is,</HI> Captain <HI>Hamond,</HI> Captain <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> Captain <HI>Haddock,</HI> Captain <HI>Guy,</HI> Captain <HI>Silver,</HI> Captain <HI>Healing,</HI> Captain <HI>Butler,</HI> Captain <HI>John Holmes,</HI> each command a Company; Sir <HI>William Jenings</HI> was al&s;o or|dered (that in ca&s;e they had attacqued
<PB N="5" REF="3">both I&s;lands at one time) he &s;hould have com|manded one divi&s;ion of the whole. The &s;hips ap|pointed for this expedition, were as followeth, The <HI>Advice, Hamp&s;hire, Tyger, Dragon,</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> fourth Rates; the <HI>Garland, Pembrook</HI> and <HI>Sweep-Stakes,</HI> fifth Rates, five Fire&s;hips, and &s;even Ketches; which being in a readine&s;s on VVedne&s;day the 8th <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> about eight in the morning, they weigh|ed from the re&s;t of the Fleet, and came to an Anchor about a League from the <HI>Buyes;</HI> where they met the Princes Plea&s;ure-Boat, called the <HI>Fanfan,</HI> who had di&s;covered within, a con&s;iderable Fleet of &s;hips near the <HI>Vly;</HI> vvhich proved to be one hundred and &s;eventy Merchants-&s;hips; the lea&s;t of which, was not of le&s;&s;e then two hundred Tuns burthen, with two Men of VVar, who had lately convoyed near one hundred of the afore&s;aid &s;hips from the North|ward, being homeward bound; &s;ome from the <HI>Streights,</HI> &s;ome from <HI>Guiny,</HI> &s;ome from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and &s;ome from the Ea&s;t-Countries; the re&s;t were out|ward bound &s;hips; all, of both parts, richly loaden. Sir <HI>Robert Holmes</HI> con&s;idering, that if he &s;hould proceed, as his de&s;ign was, fir&s;t to attempt the Land, that numerous Fleet might po&s;sibly pour in &s;uch numbers of men, as might render the Succe&s;s ha|zardous, Re&s;olved to begin with the Ships; and ac|cordingly having ordered the <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Hamp|&s;hire</HI> to lie without the <HI>Buyes,</HI> he weighed with the re&s;t of his Fleet, and the wind being contrary, with much adoe, he turned into <HI>Skelling</HI> Road, where the <HI>Tyger</HI> came to an Anchor, and immediatly Sir <HI>Robert</HI> went on board the <HI>Fanfan,</HI> and put out his
<PB N="6" REF="4">Flag; upon which the Officers came aboard him; where it was ordered, that the <HI>Pembrook</HI> which drew the lea&s;t water, with the five Fire&s;hips, &s;hould fall in among&s;t the Enemies Fleet with what &s;peed they could; Captain <HI>Brown</HI> with his Fire&s;hip laid the bigge&s;t Man of VVar very bravely aboard, and burned him down-right; Another Fire-&s;hip, run|ning up at the &s;ame time, to the other Man of VVar, he backing his &s;ails, e&s;caped that pre&s;ent execution of the Fire-&s;hip; but &s;o, as to run him|&s;elf by it on ground; where he was pre&s;ently taken by &s;ome of the Long-boates, and fired; The other three Fire&s;hips clapped the three great Merchant-men, which carried Flags in their Main Tops, and burned them. This put all their Fleet in a great confu&s;ion; which Sir <HI>Ro|bert Holmes</HI> perceiving, made a &s;ign for all the Officers to come aboard again, and pre&s;ently gave order, that Sir <HI>William Jenings</HI> with all the Boates that could be &s;pared, &s;hould take the advantage, and fall in, and burn and de&s;troy all they could; But with a &s;trict command, they &s;hould not plunder. The execution was &s;o well followed, each Cap|tain undertaking his Share, &s;ome 12. &s;ome 15. a peece, that of their whole Fleet there e&s;caped not above 8 or 9 &s;hips; one of which a <HI>Guiny</HI> Man of 24 Guns and three &s;mall Privateers, who being dravvn up into an Narrovv Corner of the Stream, &s;erved to protect 4 or 5 Merchant men, that vvere a head of them, vvhere it vvas not po&s;&s;ible for our Boats to come at them, though even the&s;e fevv vvere much damag'd; This vvork took up mo&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="4">part of that day, being the 9th of <HI>Aug.</HI> &s;o that vve had not day enough, to fall upon the I&s;land of the <HI>Vly.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Holmes</HI> being al&s;o informed by &s;ome pri&s;oners, that the place vvas not &s;o con&s;ide|rable, as it vvas repre&s;ented; and night coming on, and perceiving tvvo of the Frigots, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Dra|gon</HI> and <HI>Garland</HI> on ground, It vvas thought mo&s;t convenient; for all hands fir&s;t to go to vvork to get them off, vvhich being done, he continued in his in|tention of attempting the <HI>Vly</HI> next morning, as &s;oon as the high vvater could permit the motion of his Ve&s;&s;els; But his de&s;ign vvas novv likewi&s;e prevent|ed; for &s;o great a gu&s;t and rain hapned that night, that the Armes and Ammunition in the Boates, Hoyes, and Ketches having received much damage, he thought it be&s;t to weigh, and as the wind &s;tood, to attempt &s;omething upon the I&s;land of <HI>Skelling,</HI> vvhich the morning proving moderate vveather, he accordingly pro&s;ecuted, landing by the help of his Long boates eleven Companies on &s;hore, vvhere he di&s;covered only &s;ome fevv &s;cattering fellovves, but met vvith little or no oppo&s;ition; leaving therefore one Company to &s;ecure his Boats, him&s;elf, with ten Companies marched up three miles to the Capital Town, called <HI>Brandares,</HI> a very fair Town, or <HI>Dorp,</HI> of above one thou&s;and hou&s;es, where keeping five Companies upon the skirts of the Town, to prevent any &s;urprize of the Enemy, he &s;ent the other five to fire and burn the Town. But finding them &s;omewhat &s;low to receive that order, and fearing they might be tempted to forget them&s;elves in the
<PB N="8" REF="5">pillage; he him&s;elf was forced to &s;et fire to &s;ome hou&s;es on the wind-ward, the &s;ooner to perfect the work, and ha&s;ten his men away, which burnt with that violence, that in half an hours time, the mo&s;t part of the Town was in a flame. The Town was reported by tho&s;e that were found in it, to have been very rich; and &s;o it appeared by &s;ome of the Souldiers pockets, but very few people were to be &s;een in it, except &s;ome old men and women, which were u&s;ed with all gentlene&s;s and humanity. The remaining Villages of that I&s;land, which were two or three, had certainly run the &s;ame fortune. But, con&s;idering, it was nigh high water, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> thought it not fit to lo&s;e the opportunity of getting out to Sea; which he thought more con&s;iderable, than to &s;tay 24. hours for the de&s;truction of &s;ome few and incon&s;iderable Villages, remembring likewi&s;e, that the Channels next the Buyes, vvere very narrovv, and not bold vvithout a franck vvind. By hight of vvwater he got off all his men, and &s;et &s;ail out of the place retaining &s;till his fir&s;t intentions of falling upon the <HI>Vly;</HI> but as he vvas going on board, he received Orders from the Generals, to return to the Fleet vvith all &s;peed, vvhich he did that evening, being the 10th. of <HI>Au|gu&s;t;</HI> bringing off the marks of a &s;ingular conduct, and mo&s;t vigorous execution; be&s;ides, a con&s;ider|able booty to the private Souldiers and Sea-men, their States Plea&s;ure-boat of 12 Guns, vvithout any other lo&s;s, then of &s;ix men killed, and about as many vvounded.</P>
