<HEAD>Great News from the English FLEET: OR, THE Seamens Apology For Adhering to His Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in Defence of the Prote&s;tant Religion.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALthough thro' Cu&s;tom, and want of better Conver&s;ation, our <HI>Natures</HI> may have been &s;o far <HI>Corrupted</HI> and <HI>Deprav'd,</HI> as to degenerate into a Sympathy with the <HI>unruly Element</HI> where|in we Live; yet, &s;ince <HI>God</HI> has, in repeated Examples, &s;ignified his <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> to all his <HI>Works,</HI> we who bear an equal <HI>&s;tamp</HI> of Him&s;elf and his Goodne&s;s, cannot be altogether In&s;en&s;ible of the <HI>Benefits</HI> we have at <HI>this Time,</HI> more e&s;pecially, received from Him; for, tho' the better part of Us (we may &s;ay, the generality) were, in our Hearts, re&s;olv'd to <HI>&s;tand,</HI> and <HI>Dye,</HI> in the Defence of our Holy E|&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Religion,</HI> yet the &s;ecret <HI>Contrivances</HI> (bearing, notwith&s;tand|ing, the publick Mark of an <HI>Ill-grounded Authority</HI>) of our <HI>Enemies,</HI> either to <HI>Supplant</HI> or <HI>Di&s;place</HI> the be&s;t and chiefe&s;t of our <HI>Commanders,</HI> and, by degrees, the <HI>re&s;t,</HI> had given &s;o material a <HI>&s;hock</HI> to our <HI>Hopes</HI> and <HI>Re&s;olutions,</HI> that, till the <HI>Happy News</HI> of your <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Couragi|ous</HI> management of <HI>Affairs</HI> at <HI>Land</HI> Arriv'd, we began grievou&s;ly to fear, and, in a little time, &s;hould have had rea&s;on enough to de&s;pair of any Succe&s;s agreeable to our De&s;ires and Expectations. We do therefore fir&s;t render our Thanks to Almighty <HI>God,</HI> who has &s;av'd us out of the Jaws of our <HI>Ravenous Enemies;</HI> and next to <HI>You,</HI> for not only Your Faith and Loyalty to Your <HI>Country,</HI> Your <HI>Laws,</HI> and Your <HI>Religion,</HI> but for the good <HI>Example</HI> You have &s;hown us, whereby You have encouraged and &s;trengthened our Hands again&s;t the wor&s;t, the Malice of our <HI>Common Enemies</HI> can &s;ugge&s;t or do. And, to &s;how You our Zeal to the <HI>Common Cau&s;e,</HI> we give You to under&s;tand, our <HI>Noble Commanders</HI> and our <HI>Selves,</HI> have not been wanting in our <HI>Endeavours</HI> to purge the <HI>Navy,</HI> as You have the <HI>Army,</HI> of all <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> or others di&s;|affected to the Well-e&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Church of England:</HI> Be&s;ide, our Care not only to Guard and Defend our Coa&s;ts from the expected <HI>Inva&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Injuries</HI> of our <HI>Enemies</HI> abroad, but al&s;o to hin|der the E&s;cape and Flight of tho&s;e <HI>Villains</HI> and <HI>Traytors</HI> who have been as far as in them lay, the <HI>Betrayers</HI> of their <HI>Country,</HI> and our <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> to the malicious De&s;igns of our Irreconcilable Enemies.</P>
<P>Let us therefore Congratulate the happy Sympathy of our Hearts, and conclude it the peculiar <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>God</HI> that has &s;o univer&s;ally In&s;pir'd and united the Souls and Hearts of the People of this Kingdom in the Defence of our <HI>Holy Religion.</HI> Let us not be daunt|ed with the ill-grounded Reproaches of our Enemies, who endeavor fir&s;t to Divide us, that they may the more ea&s;ily De&s;troy us. We cannot be Ignorant of the extent of our Duty to our King, &s;ince we &s;how our &s;elves &s;o well-grounded in the knowledge of our Duty to <HI>God;</HI> for &s;ince that is wholly dependant on this, it is manife&s;t we are obliged in Con&s;cience and Nature to pro&s;&s;er the Service of our <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> before that of an <HI>Earthly Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
