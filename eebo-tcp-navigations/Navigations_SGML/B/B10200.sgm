<HEAD>A true Relation of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, &s;hewing how their <HI>Manufactures</HI> have been, are, and will be prejudicial, to the <HI>Manufactures</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> and what <HI>Endeavours</HI> have been u&s;ed for and again&s;t any Re&s;triction. Together with &s;ome <HI>Remarks</HI> thereon.</HEAD>
<P>THE Goods Imported from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> for &s;everal Years after the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany was fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hed, were Drugs, Spices, Salt-petre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ome Cour&s;e Callico's, which were mo&s;t Exported again: The Members of that Company being then afraid to adventure on other Manufactured Goods, becau&s;e they well knew they would prejudice our own, and rai&s;e a Storm again&s;t the Company, as they oftentimes declared.</P>
<P>The Charter of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company was Confirmed by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in the Thirteenth Year of his Reign: and the Law for permitting Bullion to be Exported, was made &s;oon after, at the Solicitation of that Company; and till then, little Silver or Gold was Exported. After that Law was made, begun the great Exportation of Bullion to <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Anno</HI> 72, or 73, &s;everal Artificers were &s;ent over by the Company, with great quantities of Engli&s;h Patterns, to teach the <HI>Indians</HI> how to Manufacture Goods to make them Vendible in <HI>England,</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> Markets. After which began the great Trade in Manu|factured Goods from the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>This was complained of, and proved before &s;everal Lords appointed by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in <HI>Anno</HI> 1680, or 81. Whereupon the Company received &s;ome di&s;couragement; but finding great Gain by Wrought Silks, Bengals and Callico's, would not de&s;i&s;t Trading in them: upon which great Complaints were made in Parliament, again&s;t the growth of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, which was grown &s;o large, that about 500000 <HI>l.</HI> in Bullion, and but &s;mall quantities of our Manufactures were Yearly Exported; and va&s;t quantities of Manufactured Goods Imported, for &s;everal Years before the War, which were mo&s;t &s;pent in <HI>England,</HI> and our Plantations, in the room of our own Manufactures, <HI>viz.</HI> their Wrought Silks, Bengals, Painted and Dyed Calli|co's, in the room of our Silks, Half Silks, Wor&s;ted Stuffs, Say's, Perpetuano's, and divers other Commodities, not only for Ve&s;tments for both Sexes, but for Hanging of Rooms, Beds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But this was not all the Mi&s;chief the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures did us, for by our u&s;ing <HI>Mu&s;lings, Romalls,</HI> and <HI>Callico's,</HI> they have beat out the U&s;e of fine <HI>German Linnens, Sile&s;ia Cambricks,</HI> and <HI>Lawns,</HI> which we had in return of our own <HI>Wollen Cloth, &amp;c.</HI> which Trade is now almo&s;t wholly lo&s;t: For the <HI>Sile&s;ians,</HI> when we would not take off their Linnens, could not take off our Cloth, but were compell'd, by Nece&s;&s;ity, to Set up the making Woollen Manufactures, with which they now Supply both them&s;elves and other Places, which heretofore we were wont to furni&s;h, (and, as we are Credibly inform'd, in <HI>Flanders</HI> they are now about doing the &s;ame thing)</P>
<P>By which means, the <HI>E. India</HI> Trade was encreas'd to a very great height, and their Manufactures in &s;o great reque&s;t, that they (from being a Scandal to be worn a few years before) &s;oon became the general Wear of almo&s;t all &s;orts and degrees of Per&s;ons, while our own were neg|lected, and our Manufacturers thereby under great di&s;couragements; being not able to carry on their Trades, many were forced to give over, whereby the Poor wanted Employment, the price of Wooll reduced very low, and great quantities of Wooll could not be Manufactured: Where|upon the Parliament thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make a Law for <HI>Burying in Woollen,</HI> thereby to con|&s;ume &s;ome of the Wooll that lay heavy upon the Growers Hands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> have Provi&s;ions and Materials very cheap, and Work for a Peny a Day; which di&s;ables us, and the re&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> Traders, to contend with them: and for this rea&s;on, their Trade did encrea&s;e apace, until the late War; and unle&s;s re&s;train'd, will mo&s;t certainly encrea&s;e, to the ruining of our be&s;t Fabricks, and the va&s;t number of People that have their Livelihood and Dependance thereupon.</P>
<P>Since this late War, the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company have laboured under &s;ome Di&s;couragements, and but &s;mall quantities of their Manufactur'd Goods, in proportion to what they formerly brought in, were Imported; by rea&s;on whereof, great Encouragement was given to the Manufactures of Silk, Half Silk, and Wor&s;ted, which have been very much improv'd in a great variety of Figur'd, Strip'd, and other &s;ort of Stuffs, which were made not only in <HI>London, Norwich</HI> and <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in much greater quantities than ever; but the&s;e Manufactures were &s;pread to <HI>Bristol, Newbury,</HI> and divers other parts of the Kingdom, whereby greater numbers of Poor have been employ'd, and greater quantities of Engli&s;h Wooll con&s;um'd; &s;o that the Price of the Wooll advanc'd, and the Labour and Wages of the Poor encreas'd, which enabled them to live comfortably, and con&s;ume the Product of the Land, to the great Advantage of the Landlords and Tenants, and Benefit of the Nation in general.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>From <HI>Anno</HI> 88 (for &s;everal Years) there were frequent complaints in Parliament again&s;t the <HI>Old Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and very ill things proved upon them; and extraordinary Clamours again&s;t the Trade being driven by a Joynt-Stock, exclu&s;ive of all others, by the &s;ame Men that are now &s;ome of the Directors of this <HI>New.</HI> And great indeavours were u&s;ed, and, as &s;ome &s;ay, ill Practices, to obtain a new Charter from the King; and after they had obtained a Charter with great Indu&s;try, they &s;olicited for an E&s;tabli&s;hment by Act of Parliament, and in <HI>Anno</HI> 93. a Bill was brought in, but did not pa&s;s.</P>
<P>In <HI>Anno</HI> 95. the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company indeavour'd again to get a Settlement by Act of Parliament; whereupon, the Weavers of <HI>London, Norwich, Canterbury,</HI> and the Woollen Manufacturers in many other places, petitioned, That &s;ome Re&s;traint might be laid upon the Importation or Con&s;umption of the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures: Upon which, a Bill was brought in to Re&s;train the Wearing <HI>Wrought Silks, Bengals,</HI> and <HI>Printed Callicoes;</HI> which Bill was &s;oon pa&s;t, almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly in the Hou&s;e of Commons, but being &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany, and <HI>Linnen-Drapers,</HI> it was &s;topt in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>The next Se&s;&s;ions, the Manufacturers again Petitioned, and the &s;ame Bill again brought in early in the Se&s;&s;ions; but by rea&s;on of more importunate bu&s;ine&s;s, it did not meet with &s;o quick a di&s;patch as the poor <HI>London</HI> Weavers expected, (which were at that time in great di|&s;tre&s;s for want of Employment) they grew unea&s;ie, and by fal&s;e rumours rai&s;ed by tho&s;e that were Enemies to the Bill, great multitudes of tho&s;e poor People went to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> in a Tu|multuous manner, to pray for the pa&s;&s;ing the Bill; which gave &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t, (as in rea&s;on it mu&s;t needs do) that &s;everal Members, who were friends to it before, were now again&s;t it: &s;o that the Bill pa&s;t with &s;ome difficulty in their Hou&s;e, and was again &s;topt in the Hou&s;e of Lords by a very &s;mall majority.</P>
<P>The chief Arguments u&s;ed by the <HI>Ea&s;t India Men</HI> were, That though they Export great quan|tities of our Bullion, yet they bring in more by their Goods Exported. That it's the Intere&s;t of this Nation to wear <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, becau&s;e Cheap, and &s;end our own to Forreign Markets, where they may be Sold to more Advantage. Both which Arguments were denyed, and they were challenged to prove their A&s;&s;ertions, which to this day they have not done, and till they do, it's hop'd, their bare a&s;&s;everations will not be taken for granted truths.</P>
<P>The Advocates for and again&s;t this Trade were very numerous at this time, and &s;everal other Rea&s;ons offered <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con.</HI> For the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, there was an E&s;&s;ay writ by a great Ma&s;ter of the Engli&s;h Style, who, with extraordinary Computations and Rhetorical flouri&s;hes, endea|voured to repre&s;ent this Trade Profitable to <HI>England;</HI> but his Computations, and Ob&s;ervations, being many of them not well grounded, &s;everal An&s;wers were given thereunto; however the Di&s;cour&s;e was admired, and did Service at that time. But the &s;ame Gentleman &s;ince treat|ing on another Subject, has either altered his Opinion, or el&s;e unfortunately wrote &s;omething in a late E&s;&s;ay (on the probable methods of making a People Gainers in the Balance of Trade) that makes many Men think &s;o.</P>
<P>The Ladies in general, &s;hew'd a great aver&s;ion to this Bill, whether from a di&s;like taken at the Word <HI>Restraining,</HI> or from a &s;trange delight for <HI>far fetch'd and dear bought,</HI> prefer the <HI>Indian</HI> be|fore the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, unle&s;s the Seller will &s;olemnly declare they are <HI>Indian</HI> made, not con&s;idering how impo&s;&s;ible it will be for their Rents to be paid, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures be ruin'd, which mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;uch unaccountable fancies; which if they did, we verily believe they would &s;oon re&s;train their Aver&s;ion. And what force &s;uch Advocates had, we will not pretend to determine, but hope they'll now be Advocates for this Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The beginning of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, further Applications were made; and the Manufacturers ap|prehending that the Method propo&s;ed by the former Bills would not fully An&s;wer the Prohibi|tion de&s;ign'd, offered another Bill, by which all <HI>Silks, Bengals</HI> and <HI>Callico's,</HI> which were to be Prohibited being worn in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould have been confin'd to certain Ware-Hou&s;es, and not thence removed till Exported; but this Method not being well under&s;tood, or judged rea&s;ona|ble, was oppo&s;ed, and the Bill &s;topt thereupon.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of that Se&s;&s;ions, certain very rich <HI>Merchants,</HI> and others, propo&s;ed to lend the Government two Millions, upon condition to have 8 <HI>per Cent. per Annum,</HI> and liberty to Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> exclu&s;ive of all others: The Nece&s;&s;ities of the Government for Money at that time, induced a compliance, and a Settlement of that Trade was made accordingly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h Manufacturers,</HI> with <HI>dejected Countenances</HI> and <HI>aking Hearts,</HI> beheld this mighty Structure, (which was rai&s;ed by the help of &s;ome of their <HI>Principal Pillars</HI>) and fore&s;eeing the <HI>di&s;mal</HI> con&s;equences, complain'd; but were told, 'Twas not then time, nor mu&s;t they oppo&s;e or clogg the Bill, the two Millions being <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for Supply of the Government; but were likewi&s;e told, That care &s;hould be taken of them. And the chief Promoters of the Bill, as Mr. <HI>Samuel Shepherd,</HI> mr. <HI>Heathcote,</HI> and many others, declared at that time, to divers <HI>Members</HI> of Parliament, <HI>London</HI> Weavers, and others, That they were as &s;en&s;ible as they, or the <HI>Weavers</HI> could be, that the <HI>Manufactur'd Silks, Bengals,</HI> and <HI>painted Callico's,</HI> were very <HI>prejudicial</HI> and <HI>de&s;tructive</HI> to the <HI>Manufactures</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and promis'd, with a great deal of <HI>&s;eeming Since|rity,</HI> That they would very readily agree to any rea&s;onable Re&s;traint afterwards, but nothing mu&s;t be then done, for fear of di&s;turbing the Loan &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed by that Bill.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="2">
<P>The <HI>Manufacturers</HI> having all along &s;hewed their <HI>Zeal</HI> for the Support of the pre&s;ent Govern|ment were from the&s;e Con&s;iderations induced to be quiet, and wait a more favourable juncture; and the <HI>London Weavers</HI> were &s;o allured with the fair Speeches, and charming Promi&s;es of the&s;e <HI>New Ea&s;t-India Merchants,</HI> that upon calling this <HI>Parliament,</HI> they thought none &s;o fit for their Repre&s;entatives as they; &s;o that by their Intere&s;t and Indu&s;try, two of the Principal Directors were very near carrying the Election for the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But now the Tables are turned, and the <HI>New Ea&s;t-India</HI> Men as <HI>zealou&s;ly</HI> oppo&s;e all Re&s;tricti|ons as the <HI>Old;</HI> and tho' they made &s;hew of con&s;enting to &s;ome Re&s;traints, and &s;ome Meetings and Di&s;cour&s;es were had thereupon, yet they never proceeded further, but lately neglected to meet &s;everal <HI>Members of Parliament,</HI> and others, at Time and Place agreed on by their own Ap|pointment. By which practi&s;es they plainly &s;hew, That all <HI>Ea&s;t-India Traders</HI> have the &s;ame Principals and Intere&s;t, to Support and Carry on.</P>
<P>This <HI>New Company</HI> being thus Settled, and the <HI>Old</HI> getting in for a con&s;iderable &s;hare, are now &s;triving hard which &s;hall Ride on the Fore-Hor&s;e, but both agreed to drive on to our Ruine, if not Re&s;trained by the <HI>Legi&s;lative Power</HI> of the Nation: For, if when they had a Stock but of <HI>Three hundred &s;eventy two thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and no Act of Parliament to Support them, they drove &s;o great and pernicious a Trade as is herein before recited, what can any Rational Man think will be the con&s;equence of a Stock of <HI>Two Millions,</HI> which is more than is u&s;ed by all the Manu|facturers of <HI>England?</HI> The very pro&s;pect makes many, true Lovers of their Country, Hearts ake.</P>
<P>The great quantities of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Manufactures lately Imported, and the pro&s;pect of much greater in a very &s;hort time, has been the great occa&s;ion of the ruine of the <HI>Canterbury</HI> Trade, which is reduced in le&s;s than three Years time, above Seven Parts in Eight; And have al&s;o nece&s;&s;itated mo&s;t of the <HI>London</HI> Silk-<HI>Weavers</HI> to give over their Trades; many of them are gone to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and other Foreign Parts; and a great many of tho&s;e left behind are fallen to <HI>Comb, Card</HI> and <HI>Spin</HI> Wooll, and make <HI>Wor&s;ted Stuffs, Druggets, Says, Serges,</HI> and almo&s;t all other &s;orts of our Woollen Manufactures, which have, and mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity, hinder the <HI>Weavers</HI> and <HI>Clothiers,</HI> in the &s;everal Counties and Places where the&s;e Manufactures have been for a long time made. The &s;ad Effects whereof are already &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt in the Cities of <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> that great multitudes are there out of Imployment; and being &s;o, are reduced to great Nece&s;&s;ities, and thereupon grown very unea&s;ie and burden&s;ome to tho&s;e Cities and Neighbour|hoods: And although the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Advocates</HI> pretend and in&s;inuate, That the rea&s;on of the <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Canterbury</HI> Weavers leaving off, proceeds from the want of <HI>Raw Silk,</HI> which is now very &s;carce and dear; this, tho in &s;ome mea&s;ure is allow'd to have le&s;&s;en'd their Trade, yet the principal Cau&s;e proceeds from the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Silks, Bengals,</HI> and fine <HI>painted Callico's:</HI> For were they not brought in, and &s;o generally worn here, the Weavers cou'd &s;till very well have gone on with their Trades in <HI>Slight Silks, Half Silks,</HI> and the like. And that which adds &s;till to their misfortune, is, That there has been (as we are told, and fear it's too true) above 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> in le&s;s than Ten Months, &s;ent to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> the Returns being mo&s;t in Manufactured Goods, de&s;troys their future hopes, unle&s;s &s;ome re&s;traint be put upon the Expen&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Indian Commodities.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>This being the true State of the CASE,</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Manufacturers</HI> are therefore come again, to lay before the Parliament a Repre&s;entation thereof, and hope &s;ome regard will be had to the Pre&s;ervation of the Manufactures of this King|dom; if not for their &s;akes, yet for the <HI>numerous Poor</HI> that have their dependance thereupon; and for the <HI>Landlords</HI> and <HI>Tenants,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;ts is al&s;o concern'd in this matter: For we think it will not admit of an Argument, to prove, That if the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> be di&s;couraged and rui|ned, the <HI>Owners</HI> and <HI>Farmers</HI> mu&s;t &s;hare in the misfortune: And that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Manufactures worn in this Kingdom will do it, we think mu&s;t be very plain and obvious to all that will &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider the Ca&s;e, and that are not <HI>Ea&s;t-India Merchants,</HI> or otherwi&s;e concern'd in In|tere&s;t, or mi&s;led by their fly In&s;inuations, or fallacious way of Argumentation. And for better Information of &s;uch, it's de&s;ired they would read the Ob&s;ervations of the <HI>Admired Author</HI> of the E&s;&s;ay on the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, in his E&s;&s;ay upon the <HI>Probable Methods of making a People Gainers by the Balance of Trade,</HI> p. 128. And that part of an E&s;&s;ay on the State of <HI>England,</HI> in relation to <HI>its Trade, its Poor, and its Taxes,</HI> which relates to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade (writ by Mr. <HI>John Cary):</HI> And if the&s;e will not &s;atisfy their doubts, there will very &s;hortly be farther An&s;wers given to all <HI>material Ob|jections</HI> that have been rai&s;ed again&s;t this Re&s;triction; and in the mean time, we humbly con|ceive our Ca&s;e de&s;erves the con&s;ideration of the Parliament, as well as either the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies, and Hope, and Pray, it may be con&s;idered accordingly.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="3">
<HEAD>A &s;hort <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> of the CASE, with &s;ome <HI>Remarks</HI> thereupon.</HEAD>
<P>THat for &s;everal Years, after the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company was E&s;tabli&s;h'd, they were afraid to bring in Manufactured Goods, which they knew were very prejudicial to our own: But now, by their great Stock and Intere&s;t, they are got over the&s;e fears, and bring in va&s;t quantities, oppo&s;ing all kind of Re&s;traint, tho' they are convinc'd, and have declared their Manufactures are prejudicial to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>That as their Manufactures increas'd, our own were di&s;couraged, and <HI>Wooll</HI> reduced &s;o low, that an Act was made for <HI>Burying in Woollen,</HI> and the Manufacturers at the &s;ame time redu|ced to great nece&s;&s;ities, and many ruin'd thereby.</P>
<P>That during great part of the late War, the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade was under &s;ome Di&s;courage|ment, and while it was &s;o, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures flouri&s;hed very much, and extended to &s;everal Places, where before, the People were out of Employment, <HI>Wool advanced</HI> and bore a good Price, and all other Provi&s;ions rai&s;ed proportionably.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Engli&s;h Manufacturers,</HI> finding the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Traders endeavouring to get an E&s;tabli&s;h|ment by <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament, and knowing how fatal it might prove to their Manufactures, unle&s;s they were in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;train'd, made their Application to the Parliament, and in Two &s;ucceeding Se&s;&s;ions a Re&s;training Bill was pa&s;t in their Favour in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and a Third being drawn up in a different Method to the Two former, was &s;topt thereupon.</P>
<P>That the Propo&s;al of advancing Two Millions for the Supply of the Government, was the great Inducement for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the New Company; and the Rea&s;ons the Manufacturers did not then &s;o vigorou&s;ly complain and &s;ollicite again&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;hment, as formerly they had done, proceeded from the fair Promi&s;es given by the New <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Men, and the Hope of a more favourable Opportunity; being unwilling to di&s;turb the Loan &s;o nece&s;&s;ary then to be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>That the Manufacturers being deceived by the&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Traders fair Promi&s;es, and finding that the late great Importation and Wear of their <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures are increa&s;ing, and have already, in a great mea&s;ure, ruin'd the <HI>Canterbury</HI> Trade, and obliged the <HI>London</HI> Weavers to fall upon all &s;orts of Woollen Manufactures, to the Prejudice (and may in a &s;hort time prove to the utter Ruin) of &s;everal Places where the&s;e Manufactures have for a long time been <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> are therefore come again to repre&s;ent their <HI>deplorable</HI> Ca&s;e, and pray the Con&s;ideration of this <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> and hope they will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider it as well as either the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies Ca&s;es.</P>
