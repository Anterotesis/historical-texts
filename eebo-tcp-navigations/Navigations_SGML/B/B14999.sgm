<P>Being thus readie, doe &s;et &s;aile the twelfth of Aprill one thou&s;and &s;ixe hundred and fiue, nothing hapning worth note, till wee came as high as the North Cape, where an Engli&s;h Barke ouertaking vs, foure of our Gentlemen, by rea&s;on of their &s;ickene&s;&s;e were de&s;irous to returne home againe, &s;o that getting their pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Lisbone,</HI> they tooke their leaue of vs, who&s;e names were, Mai&s;ter <HI>Rogers,</HI> Mai&s;ter <HI>Catlin,</HI> Mai&s;ter <HI>San|ders,</HI> and another who&s;e name I doe not now remember.

<P>From thence (hauing weyed our Anchor) with a mer|rie gale we &s;ailed towardes our de&s;ired place to the coun|trey of <HI>Guiana:</HI> but mi&s;&s;ing of our expectation, here be|gan the fir&s;t &s;cene of our en&s;uing mi&s;eries: for whether it was our Ma&s;ters want of knowledge that we fell not with the prefixed place, or that the current which our ma|&s;ter alledged to be the rea&s;on, that &s;etting verie &s;trongly to the North-wards, put vs &s;o farre &s;hort thereof, or whi|ther (as of all others that is mo&s;t certaine) it plea&s;ed God in that place at that time, and in &s;uch a manner, to let vs feele &s;ome part of his heauie di&s;plea&s;ure, conceyued a|gain&s;t vs for our times formerly mi&s;pent: &s;o as I &s;ay the ending of our hopes was the beginning of our mi&s;e|ries: for plying to and againe, wandring as it were in a wilderne&s;&s;e of woe, betwixt hope and di&s;paire, the time pa&s;&s;ed away &amp; with the time our victuals, the onely hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our health exceedingly wa&s;ted: therevpon our allow|ance was greatly &s;hortned, &amp; with the &s;ame &amp; other occur|rencee our mens minds very much di&s;tracted, which bred among&s;t vs many fearfull &amp; daungerous mutinies. And as one mi&s;erie commeth &s;till in the necke of another, &s;o fa|red it with vs: for with our want of victuals, we being neare vnto the Equinoctiall, and the Sun in that part of the Zodiacke which was neare vnto our Zenith, it was &s;o exceeding hot, that with the vehemencie thereof many of our men fell maruellous weake, and &s;ome of them died, namely our Carpenters mate <HI>Iohn Browne,</HI> our

<PB REF="8"> and the chiefe of our companie would not con|&s;ent thereto. And &s;eeing it was in vaine all of vs for to venter home in the Shippe with that &s;mall allowance, wee were willing to come a &s;hore, and there to liue vn|till it &s;hould plea&s;e God to &s;end &s;ome meanes to bring vs a way: vpon that condition they &s;hould deliuer vnto vs one great peece, and euery man his Mu&s;ket and wea|pons, and halfe the munition in the &s;hip, with all our Che&s;ts and commodities what&s;oeuer, which hee would not graunt, before we had &s;ub&s;cribed to a certaine Wri|ting which he wrote to excu&s;e him&s;elfe at his returne in|to England: &s;o we receyued foure little Barrels of pow|der, and ten round Bullets for the great Peece, which when wee brought a &s;hore did much feare the <HI>Indians,</HI> for they a&s;ked vs if we brought it to kill them. But to plea&s;e their humours, wee tolde them it was to kill the Spaniards, and then they came and helped vs a &s;hore with her, and with all our Che&s;tes, of their owne ac|cord.</P>
<P>Now after they had deliuered all things a &s;hore out of the Boat, we thought it good to &s;tay her, and to k&eacute;epe her for our owne v&s;e, for wee did not know what neede we might haue of &s;uch a commoditie afterwarde: &s;o w&eacute;e &s;ent the &s;ailers aboord in an Indian Boat, onely three would not goe but would &s;tay with vs: &s;o we were in all left a &s;hore three&s;core and &s;eauen in the I&s;le of Saint <HI>Lucca.</HI></P>
<P>At night when we were all &s;itting togither at &s;upper about a great fire, which they could well perceue from the &s;hip when it was darke: and as it &s;hould &s;eeme in reuenge of their Boat, before they departed they pur|po&s;ed to let vs know they were not well plea&s;ed with the action, they &s;hot a great peece at vs with a &s;ingle Bullet, but as it plea&s;ed God it fell downe by the &s;ide of our hou&s;e, and mi&s;&s;ed vs, which if it had come amonge&s;t vs we &s;itting &s;o thicke, it could not haue cho&s;en but haue
<PB REF="8"> beene the death of many of vs.</P>
<P>This made Captaine <HI>Sen-Iohns</HI> di&s;charge our p&eacute;ece at them, without intent to hurt them, but fairly ouer&s;hot them: for he might haue &s;unke them, and would if they had &s;hot once more: then pre&s;ently they weyed Anchor and departed.</P>
<P>The next morning Captaine <HI>Sen-Iohns</HI> went in the Boate, with fifteene more in his companie, to trade with <HI>Anthonio</HI> his father for <HI>Rone</HI> cloath, which he had &s;aued at &s;ea great &s;tore: but when we came there, contrarie to our expectation, we found our &s;hip there trading with them, who had incen&s;ed the Indians &s;ore agayn&s;t vs, telling them that we were had people, and would take all they had from them, and would cut their throats.</P>
<P>And as we towed along&s;t the &s;hore, they di&s;charged halfe a dozen peece of Ordenance, and a volly of &s;mall &s;hot at vs, but there great &s;hot ouer&s;hot vs, and light vp|on the rockes, and &s;carred the Indians a &s;hore mightily, and their &s;mall &s;hotte light &s;hort without harming vs. Their decermination was to driue vs from our Boat, or el&s;e to haue &s;unke her, for their great &s;hot came &s;o thicke that wee were forced to leape a &s;hore into the Woods: then they manned their Periago, and came to take our Boat away, which wee perceyuing entered her againe, and e&s;caped all their malice: &s;o wee returned home a|gaine &s;afe, and they departed toward Saint <HI>Vincent,</HI> the eighteenth or ninteenth of Augu&s;t, 1605.</P>
<P>After the departure of our &s;hip we remained in peace|able manner among&s;t the Indians, dayly trading with them for all manner of victuall, as Plantons, Potatoes, Penas, Papaians, Pumpins, Galloba&s;hoes, Pappes, Mammies, Guiauas, with diuer&s;e other fruits, and To|bacco aboundance, all verie plea&s;ant to eate. Al&s;o they brought Turtles, Guanas Hens and Chickens, Wood|cocks and Snipes, with &s;ome Pellicans.</P>
<P>As for the Turtles, we our &s;elues did v&s;e euery night
<PB REF="9"> by cour&s;es to &s;end out &s;ixe to catch them, which is ea&s;ily done, by rea&s;on that euery night they v&s;e to come a &s;hore, and lay their egs in the &s;and, and by the heat of the Sun they are hatched. At their co~ming out of the water they do make as broad a tract as a Cart with their &s;ins, by which meanes wee are ledde to the place where they doe &s;it, and &s;o we turne them on their backes, which being done, they can doe nothing but &s;o lie till they bee deade. The meate of them dooth eate like vnto Veale, and I haue &s;eene taken out of one of them to the number of &s;ixe or &s;eauen hundred egges, which wee doe frie with the fat or oyle of the Turtle, and al&s;o with Ca&s;&s;ada wee did make exceeding good White-pots and Puddings, putting the Egges and Oyle into it. Al&s;o the <HI>Guana</HI> is proportioned like a Serpent, more then an ell long, with foure &s;hort feete.

<P>This <HI>Ca&s;&s;ada</HI> is a roote of a tree, who&s;e iuce is poy&s;on: but being &s;quea&s;&s;ed, the flower doth make an excellent kind of bread, and will k&eacute;epe long.</P>
<P>The Indians did maruaile much at our manner of dre&s;&s;ing our meate, and they would be familier, and would dine with vs verie often, but by no meanes wee could not make them eate &s;alt: for they v&s;e to eate all their meate &s;ea&s;oned with Ginnie Pepper: their women came verie &s;eldome vnto vs, for they are verie iealous ouer them. Once or twice there came &s;ome wo|men with them, vnto whome wee gaue &s;hirts to couer their nakedne&s;&s;e, whereof they &s;eemed proud: Their an|cient women are verie vgly, by rea&s;on of their &s;ide brea&s;tes, which dooth lie like emptie bagges: but tho&s;e which haue not giuen &s;ucke, are well proportioned and proper.</P>
<P>Al&s;o we had a Net, with the which wee would get at one draught as many fi&s;h of diuer&s;e &s;orts, as would
<PB REF="9"> &s;erue all our companie a day.</P>
<P>A little before our arriuall, three Spani&s;h &s;hips were ca&s;t away, and much of the goodes the&s;e Indians had &s;aued with their Boats, and hid it in the Woods, they had &s;o much Roan cloath, that all their Periagoes had &s;ayles thereof. They al&s;o had great &s;tore of &s;tuffe, Sirge, and Spani&s;h woollen cloath, cloakes and appa|rell: in&s;omuch that if we had had a Barke of fortie tuns burthen, wee could haue loaden her home with &s;uch commodities as would haue made a &s;auing voyage. All which we could haue bought for hatchets, kniues, beads, fi&s;h-hookes, and thimbles, with other trifles.</P>
<P>Thus for the &s;pace of fiue or &s;ixe Weekes, wee went not much abroade, but cut downe the Woods about our hou&s;es euerie day, and mounted our great Peece vp|on broade Tables, which wee our &s;elues had &s;awne, lea&s;t the <HI>Carrebyes</HI> &s;hould at any time a&s;&s;ault vs.</P>
<P>Soone after this, there came onother Captaine from Saint <HI>Vincent,</HI> called <HI>Augraumart,</HI> which was brother to <HI>Anthonio,</HI> who was offended with him for &s;elling the hou&s;es vnto vs: for the which cau&s;e <HI>Anthonio</HI> bid vs kill him, and tolde vs hee purpo&s;ed to bring twelue Periagoes loaden with <HI>Carrebyes</HI> to kill vs, but wee found this <HI>Augraumart</HI> verie kinde vnto vs, and was willing to doe, or tell vs any thing wee de&s;ired him, for he taught vs to make a Grater, which he made of &s;mall &s;harpe flint &s;tones beaten into a broade boord to grate our <HI>Ca&s;&s;ada</HI> on, whereof we made our breade, and hee tolde vs, that <HI>Anthonio</HI> would cut our throates, and therefore bid vs kill him. This made vs doubtfull which to tru&s;t to.</P>
<P>We had certaine Articles drawne, which were to b&eacute;e ob&s;erued, wherein Captaine <HI>Nicholas Sen-Iohns</HI> was Captaine: his brother <HI>Alexander</HI> Lieutenant, <HI>Miles Pet,</HI> and <HI>Philip Gla&s;cock</HI> were commaunders for the appoynting of our Watch: <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> was our
<PB REF="10"> interpreter for the Spani&s;h tongue, and was to buy and bargaine with the Indians for all the companie, both for commodities and victuals, Mai&s;ter <HI>Garret,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Tench, Francis Brace,</HI> and my &s;elfe, were appointed to order the dome&s;ticall matters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carebie</HI> &s;ig|nifies in their language, A valiant man.</NOTE>All the occa&s;ions y^t we made whereby the <HI>Carrebyes</HI> &s;hould fall out with vs, was that one of our companie did &s;ell a &s;worde vnto Captaine <HI>Anthonio,</HI> which was con|trarie to the Articles wee had &s;et downe, for none was (vpon paine of &s;euere puni&s;hment) to &s;el either Sworde, Dagger, or Hedge-bill: which when we knew, <HI>Alexan|der Sen-Iohns</HI> with a dozen more went to his hou&s;e, and found him in his bed, which they call an <HI>Hamaco,</HI> with a little fire vnder him becau&s;e hs was not well, and the Sword &s;tanding by him, which yong <HI>Sen-Iohns</HI> tooke and brought forth to vs. This droue him into a great rage again&s;t vs, for neuer after that would he be familiar with vs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carrebyes</HI> did weare for an ornament vpon the &s;mall of their naked aimes a foure-&s;quare plate, which mai&s;ter <HI>Browne</HI> a Gold-finer told Captaine <HI>Sen-Iohns</HI> had three partes of it Golde, who a&s;ked the <HI>Carrebyes</HI> where they got it? who pre&s;ently pointed vs to a great Mountaine on the North-we&s;t part of the I&s;land, who&s;e toppe we might &s;ee from the place where wee dwelt: but <HI>Anthonio</HI> &s;aide there was none. The&s;e contrarie tales made vs &s;u&s;pect &s;ome villanie, and that it was but a pol|licie to drawe &s;ome of our companie thither, whereby they might the better deale with vs: for at home they d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t not attempt any thing again&s;t vs, both for feare of our great Peece, and al&s;o wee would not &s;uffer them to bring their bowes and arrowes within our Centi|nell. Yet our Captaine would not bee content till wee con&s;ented that hee &s;hould goe to the Mountaine, and tooke with him all &s;ortes of commodities to bargaine with the Indians for Cloath, and he tooke old <HI>Browne</HI>

<P>And vpon A Monday they all imbarked in the Boat taking eight dayes victuall with them, promi&s;ing to re|turn betwixt that and the next Monday, leauing his bro|ther <HI>Miles Pet, Philip Gla&s;cock,</HI> M. <HI>Garret,</HI> M. <HI>Tench,</HI> and my &s;elfe, to rule at home. Vpon Tue&s;day &amp; Wedne&s;|day the Indians did not come vnto vs with victuals as they had wo~t, which made vs after &s;u&s;pect that they were at the &s;laughter of our men at the Mount: &amp; vpon Wed|ne&s;day, my &s;elfe with 3. more went to <HI>Anthonios</HI> hou&s;e, where we found a great number of women, but not pa&s;|&s;ing halfe a &s;core men, making great preparation of vic|tuals: &s;ome baking of Ca&s;&s;ada, others roa&s;ting and boy|ling of great fi&s;hes and Turtles. I offred to buy &s;ome of them, but they refu&s;ed and would not, neither would they looke of any commoditie we had, which made vs much maruell: for before that time they neuer denied vs: &s;o we departed, &amp; by the way we light of a narrow path where|in we trauelled a little, and all along the way did growe aboundance of Guiaua trees, who&s;e fruit is as big as an Apple, and verie plea&s;ant to eate: the greene ones are whole&s;ome for the bloodie flixe.</P>
<P>Wee had not trauayled a Mile, but wee entered downe by a Thicket into a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Garden of Potatoes, which droue vs into greate admiration to beholde the manner of it, for it was made round like a Bower, encompa&s;&s;ed with a greene Banke, &s;o equally, that made vs thinke &s;ome Chri&s;tians had made it for a &s;trength to &s;aue them from the Indians: and vppon the toppe thereof did growe a companie of the mo&s;te
<PB REF="11"> talle&s;t Tr&eacute;es that euer I behelde, which did naturally growe &s;o neere one to another, and &s;o thicke from the roote to the toppe, that wee could not perceyue the &s;kie through them. But following the path, wee percey|ued it to pa&s;&s;e through a narrow cut in the banke, where wee traueyled two or three miles further, pa&s;&s;ing through many goodly Gardens, wherein was aboun|dance of Ca&s;&s;ada, Potatoes, Tobacco, Cotten-wool-trees, and Guiaua trees, in diuer&s;e places as wee tra|uayled wee did maruaile to &s;ee the huge and great tr&eacute;es that were there: for mo&s;t of them were fiue or &s;ixe fa|thoms about, and fearing that wee &s;houlde bee be|nighted, wee returned the &s;ame way againe, with as much greene Tobacco, Potatoes, and Ca&s;&s;ada, as wee could carrie, which did much content our men at home: for the Indians had not brought any victuals in three dayes before.</P>
<P>At night &s;ixe of our men went to &s;eeke for Tur|tles, and founde two verie great ones, but could not bring them home. For when they had turned them on their backes, it beganne to raine, thunder, and lighten &s;o extreamly, that they had much a doe to get home them&s;elues, and &s;o it continued all night, with the mo&s;te horrible&s;t thunder-claps that euer I heard, with lightning and raine as light as day, which cau&s;ed vs to awake, and after prayers to fit all night by greate Fiers, drinking of Tobacc, with extra|ordinarie myrth amonge&s;t our &s;elues, little fore|&s;eeing the daunger that befell to vs the next day.</P>
<P>Earely the next Morning, wee went to bring home our Turtles, and there wee founde a great number of <HI>Carrebyes</HI> on the &s;hore, and three or foure Boates by them, roa&s;ting of lande Crabbes, for what pur|po&s;e they were &s;o gathered together wee know not, but lea&s;t we &s;hould &s;u&s;pect them of any bad intent towardes
<PB REF="11"> vs, they willed vs to eate with them, and brought home our Turtles to our hou&s;es.</P>
<P>All that fore-noone wee kept good watch, for there was verie many which came both by Sea and land. and <HI>Augraumart</HI> and his father came with a great num|ber of Indians, and brought in his hande a quarter of a Turtle, and a hundred Egges, and gaue them to young <HI>Sen-Iohns,</HI> and tolde him, that if hee would goe to his Brother <HI>Anthonius</HI> hou&s;e, hee &s;hould haue greate &s;tore of victualls, and that hee &s;hould &s;ee his wife, and the more to per&s;wade vs to goe, hee promi&s;ed that wee &s;hould haue Hamacas for to &s;leepe in, which is the beds they v&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Women dooth make them of Cotten that growes naturallye on the Trees, wereof they haue a|boundance. Wee manye times made &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">te vnto them for their Hamacas, becau&s;e they would bee a meanes to &s;aue vs from the Stings of curtaine. Flor called a Mu&s;keto, the which would &s;o torment vs with their pay loued &s;tings, and cau&s;e vs to &s;well as though we had the Lepro&s;ie, for they would &s;ting through three payr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Stockings, but they were not willing till now on the &s;uddaine that wee &s;hould haue any. And becau&s;e they were &s;o kinde to vs, wee tooke them all into our hou&s;es, and were verie merrye and plea&s;ant with them, and gaue them <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> which they delighted much in.</P>
<P>But Mai&s;ter <HI>Tench</HI> (who had wont to bee a curi|ous corrector of vs in our merr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ments) did &s;how him&s;elfe &s;o extraordinarie plea&s;ant, that hee fell a &s;inging of Cat|ches with the <HI>Carrebyes,</HI> and cau&s;ed them in drinke ca|rou&s;es of <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> and water.</P>
<P>If wee had beene determined to haue kild them, wee might haue done it at that time with &s;mall danger, wee had a hundreth and aboue of them within out hou|&s;es without eyther dowe or Arrowes. And when &s;ome
<PB REF="12"> of our companie, made &s;uch a motion as to put them to the Sworde (for &s;ome of vs was halfe and more iealous of them, that they had done &s;ome mi&s;chiefe to our cap|taine, by rea&s;on one of our companie did &s;ay, that hee heard an Indian &s;ay, that the Captaine of the Eng|li&s;h had his hande cutte off at the Mount) but this was not regarded, but was imputed that hee had mi&s;con&s;trued the <HI>Carrobyes</HI> language. Mai&s;ter <HI>Tench</HI> was agayn&s;t it, &s;aying: God woulde not bee plea&s;ed with &s;uch a bloudie Act, agayn&s;t &s;uch harm|le&s;&s;e people, and therefore willed vs not to doe it without they gaue the fir&s;t occa&s;ion, wherein hee wronged him|&s;elfe and vs all, in &s;eeking to &s;aue the liues of them, who within three houres after mo&s;t cruellye mur|thered him.</P>
<P>Before Dinner they all departed, but <HI>Augrau|mart</HI> and his father, who dined with vs. And pre|&s;ently after dinner, eighteene was cho&s;en to goe to <HI>Anthonios</HI> hou&s;e with <HI>Augraumart</HI> and his father, who had neither bowe nor arrow: onely his father had a Bra&s;ell &s;worde.</P>
<P>This they did lea&s;t wee &s;houlde &s;u&s;pect their trea|cherie. But wee not fearing anie trea&s;on, becau&s;e wee had beene often times well v&s;ed there before, went on boldly,</P>
<P>And &s;ome of our companie thought that the verie fight of our Peeces was &s;ufficient to terrifie them, for attempting any villany again&s;t vs. And therfore did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">egarde either to charge them, or to light our match.</P>
<P>In this carele&s;&s;e and &s;ecure manner wee trauay|led through a little necke of land which runnes farre in|to the Sea, and then wee entered vpon the &s;and, which was &s;o extreame hote with the reflexion of the Sunne that wee were not able to trauaile apace, being loaden with our Peeces.</P>
<P>But Mai&s;ter <HI>Alexander</HI> had put off his Doub|let,
<PB REF="12"> and gaue his Boy his Peece, &amp; went ie&s;ting &amp; play|ing arme in arme with the two <HI>Carrebyes</HI> a good &s;pace before vs, vntil wee came to a point of Land a quarter of a mile from <HI>Anthonios</HI> hou&s;e, and then hee called vs to come forward, but hee beeing light and coole, did keepe a greate way before vs &s;till. And when hee lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected daunger, <HI>Augraum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">t</HI> made as though hee would imbrace him, And &s;uddenlye cla&s;|ping holde with one hand on his Rapyer, and the other on his Dagger, and his Father with a great Bru&s;&s;ell Sword, &s;trooke him downe before we could come at him, but he recouered againe.</P>
<P>Then came the Arrowes &s;o thicke out of the wood, that we could not get our match in the Cocke for pulling the Arrowes out of our bodyes: &s;o among&s;t vs all was but fiue or &s;ixe peeces di&s;charged, which when the Indians &s;aw giue fire, they did fall flat on the ground, &s;houting and crying with a mo&s;te helli&s;h noy&s;e, na|ming vs by our names when they hit vs.</P>
<P>Then wee retyred backe to a poynt of land, thinking there to haue fitted our peeces, and to haue giuen them a volley of &s;hot, But there came another Ambu&s;h on our backes, and round about vs, in&s;omuch that wee were in|forced to for&s;ake our peeces, and betake vs to our &s;words, which did much incourage them, for when they &s;ee wee could not hurt them with our peeces, they would come &s;o neere vs, as though they purpo&s;ed to make choyce in what place to hit vs, of &s;ome they &s;hot in the faces, others through the Shoulders, and of others, they would naile their feete and the ground together.</P>
<P>Mai&s;ter <HI>Budge</HI> and <HI>Robert Shaw</HI> ranne into the &s;ea, and there were both drowned and kild with Arrowes, Mai&s;ter <HI>Tench</HI> had a little Bucklet, with the which bee did &s;aue him&s;elfe a long time, but at the la&s;t an Arrowe pa&s;&s;ed through both his legges, that hee could not goe,
<PB REF="13"> and &s;tooping to pull it out, they kild him, and if anye of vs offered to runne at one or two of them, they would runne away, and of a &s;uddaine twentie or thirtie would inclo&s;e vs, and &s;till &s;hoote Arrowes in them til they were downe, and then would they with a great Bra&s;&s;ell &s;word beate them to death, and after would rifle them: Mai&s;ter <HI>Kettleby</HI> did behaue him&s;elfe verie gallantlye, for hee did not re&s;pect what arrowes hee receiued in his bodye, &s;o hee could but reach one &s;troke at a <HI>Carrebye,</HI> but they were too nimble for vs in regard they were naked.</P>
<P>Yet neuerthele&s;&s;e, wee runne through them all, thin|king that if wee had e&s;caped that ambu&s;h, there had b&eacute;en no more to trouble vs, but as I was a pulling Arrowes out of his bodye, to the number of twentie at the lea&s;t, there came the third ambu&s;h out of the woodes from whence came an Arrowe and hit him in the Brea&s;t, which hee perceiued would bee his death, for hee could not &s;tand but as I hold him, but I was forced to let him goe, and &s;hift to &s;aue my &s;elfe.</P>
<P>Then I ouer tooke young <HI>Sen-Iohns</HI> his bodye almo&s;t full of Arrowes, of which I pulled out a number, But what for the bloud that runne from him, and the ex|treame heate hee was in by his running, hee was not able to ouertake the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t of our companye that was before.</P>
<P>And &s;till the <HI>Carrebyes</HI> did gather ground vppon vs, and the Arrowes came thicke on euerie &s;ide.</P>
<P>Then hee willed mee to intreate them &s;tay, and when I had ouertaken one, I cau&s;ed him to &s;tay, which hee was vnwilling to doe, for hee tolde mee his Sword would not come foorth of the Scabberd, &s;o I tooke hold of the Hilts, and betwixt vs both pulled it out, but before wee had made an ende, the&s;e cruell and bloodye <HI>Carre|byes</HI> had encompa&s;&s;ed yong <HI>Sen-Iohns</HI> yet (to my griefe) I did &s;tand and beholde his ende, who before hee fell
<PB REF="13"> did make them run like &s;o many Curres from a Lyon: for looke which way hee ran, they all fled before him: his body was &s;o loaden with Arrowes, that he fell to the ground: and vpon one hand and knees, hee did keepe them from him with his Swoord, &s;o much hee &s;corned &s;o ba&s;ely to dye at their handes.</P>
<P>We two were then the onely markes they aymed at: for hauing rifled young <HI>Seniohus,</HI> they pur&s;ued vs very hotly, which cau&s;ed vs make ha&s;te to foure of our fel|lowes, who were entred into a narrow path, which lea|deth through the woods, from the &s;andes to the Hou&s;es where wee dwelt: but there was in the path an other Ambu&s;h, which droue them backe to the &s;andes againe: and when they &s;aw vs &s;o hardly cha&s;ed, they entred the path with vs againe.</P>
<P>The one &s;ide of the path was a high Mountayne, the other went downe a low Valley. The fir&s;t foure tooke vp the Mountayn, by which meanes, they were a fayre marke for them to hitte, who dropped downe one after another.</P>
<P>All this time, neyther <HI>Harry</HI> which was M. <HI>Stokeleys</HI> man (a Marchant now in <HI>Bucklersbery</HI>) nor my &s;elfe was &s;hot: but as we thought de&s;peratly to run through them in the narrowe path, there came an Arrowe and pearced quite through his head, of the which he fell &s;ud|denly, and I ran to lift him vp, but he was dead without &s;peaking one word to mee at all.</P>
<P>Then came there two Arrowes and hitte mee in the back, the one directly again&s;t my hart, the other through my &s;houlder blade: &s;o (with my &s;woord in my hande) I ran vpon them de&s;peratly, thinking (before I had died) to haue ben the death of &s;ome of them. And in my run|ning, I &s;aw Captaine <HI>Anthony,</HI> with an Arrow in his Bow drawne again&s;t me, who &s;tood vntill I came very n&eacute;ere him (for he purpo&s;es to haue &s;ped m&eacute;e with that
<PB REF="14"> &s;hot) which when I &s;&eacute;e come. I thought to put it by with my &s;woord, but it light on my hand, &amp; pa&s;&s;ed thorow the handle of my &s;word, and nayled both together: but I co~|tinued running at him &s;till; and before he could nocke an|other, I made him and all the re&s;t turne their backs, and run into the &s;ands againe: which oportunity when I e|&s;pyed, I leapt into the wood, downe to the valley, where I found a great Lake: And hearing them, with great &s;howts and cry, which they v&s;e in &s;igne of tryumph and victory, pur&s;ue mee &s;till, I leapt into the Lake, with my &s;word nayled to my hand, and two arrowes in my backe, and by the helpe of God &s;wamme ouer, but with much adoo: for the further &s;ide was &s;hallow water, but I wa|ded in mud vp to the wa&s;te, which had almo&s;t &s;pent me.</P>
<P>Now when I was ouer, I conuayd my &s;elfe into the thicke&s;t parts of y^e wood, making all the ha&s;te I could, to giue my fellowes, which were at home, warning, le&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould &s;et on them vnawares: and in my going, I came into a path, and &s;ought for a great tr&eacute;e, to &s;&eacute;e, if by the ayme of the Iland, I could perceyue which way our hou&s;es &s;tood. Then &s;uddenly I heard a great noy&s;e, which made me &s;tand behind a tree, and there I &s;aw two or three <HI>Indians</HI> goe by me, which I imagined were go|ing to &s;et on the~ at home: but it plea&s;ed God I got home, &amp; gaue warning before their co~ming: &s;o <HI>Miles Pet</HI> char|ged our great Peece, and al our men were in redines for their co~ming. Then pre&s;ently, they all came in &s;ight vpo~ the &s;ands, whome we &s;ent away (by &s;hooting of our great Peece) &amp; came no more in 3. daies: in which time, we for|tified our &s;elues with our Che&s;ts: And vpon Munday morning (before wee had made an end of praier) there came to the number of 13. or 14. C. <HI>Indians</HI> (both by &s;ea and land,) &amp; there be&s;et vs round, making a noy&s;e with their Hornes, and made mo&s;t horrible cryes, which they no v&s;e, the more to terryfle their enemies: and we did an|&s;were
<PB REF="14"> them agayne with the lyke cryes, deuyding our &s;elues into 4 parts, according as we had made our Forts of our Che&s;ts, placing fiue in euery Forte, and thr&eacute;e to the great P&eacute;ece, where <HI>Miles Pett,</HI> my &s;elfe and an|other was. Then they &s;hot their Arrowes among vs as thicke as hayle, and le&s;t they &s;hould follow in vpon vs and make v&s;e of tho&s;e Arrowes agayne, we gathe|red them all together, &amp; made great fires with them be|fore their faces, and many times they purpo&s;ed to ru&s;h in vpon vs by multitudes, &amp; to haue beaten vs downe with their Brazell Swoordes: But our great Peece was &s;o mounted, that very readyly we could turne it which way we plea&s;ed, and looke which way their greate&s;t company went, we let her flye among&s;t them. So perceiuing that they could not preuaile again&s;t vs, they put Cotten wooll vpon the end of their Arrowes, and put fire on them and &s;hot at our Hou&s;es which were made on long Canes or R&eacute;edes, and &s;uddenly tooke fire by rea&s;on of the heat of the day, &amp; burned downe to the ground, fa&s;tning on our Che&s;ts which were our Forts, and burned all downe to the ground, the extreme heat of the flame did make our men for&s;ake their Forts, and retyre behinde the great P&eacute;ece, to the Sea-&s;ide, which incouraged the <HI>Carrabies</HI> mightily. M. <HI>William Kettleby</HI> lay clo&s;e vn&s;&eacute;ene of the <HI>Indians</HI> vpon the &s;and, and with a long Peece hee would reach the~ 12. &s;core paces, &amp; galled them much: otherwi&s;e, they would haue come on the backes of vs by Sea, but he &s;hot their Boats thorow and thorow, and &s;card them for entring that way.

<P>After that our hou&s;e was burned and all our Che&s;ts, which before were our Fort, we fortified our &s;elues with the remnants of the &s;takes, and thatch which we &s;aued fro~ burning, &s;etting it in the ground &s;lepewi&s;e, couering it with Sand &amp; Earth, which &s;aued vs euer after from their Arrowes.</P>

But in the mid&s;t of all this vnendurable mi&s;ery, it plea&s;ed God (contrary to our expectatio~, in &s;ome &s;ort) to relieue vs euen by our enemyes: For when all the re&s;t were out of &s;ight, one <HI>Periago</HI> returned very well prouided of victual, and thr&eacute;e or foure came on land, with as much as they were able to carry of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ada, Potatos</HI> &amp; <HI>Plantons,</HI> and cryed vnto vs to exchange with the~, fir&s;t holding vp their Bowes, and after laying them on the ground againe in &s;igne of peace: which we perceiuing, &s;ent out three likewi&s;e to bargain without weapons, carrying Kniues, Beades and other trifles: Which being done, they departed, and we returned, giuing pray&s;e to God (thus miraculou&s;ly) for to feede vs, for w&eacute;e had no meanes of our &s;elues to get any.</P>
<P>Then, the Nette (with the which we had wont get a&s;much fi&s;h of all &s;orts as would &s;uffi&s;e vs all for a day) the <HI>Indians</HI> tooke from vs.</P>
<P>Thus for the &s;pace of 6. or 7. dayes, euery day figh|ting for the &s;pace of thr&eacute;e or foure houres, and then our victuall began to faile againe, which cau&s;ed vs to hold out a Flag of truce: which the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiuing, came in peaceable maner vnto vs, Then one <HI>Francis Brace</HI> (by meane of his French tongue) made them vnder|&s;tand that our de&s;ire was to giue them all that wee had, if they would let vs haue a <HI>Periago</HI> to carry vs away, which one Captain <HI>Antonio</HI> willingly con&s;ented vnto, and the next day after brought her, drawing her a&s;hore within the compa&s;&s;e of our Fortes, we giuing them, of Hatchets, Kniues and Beads vntyll they were conten|ted: And to plea&s;e them the more, we gaue them euery one a Shouell or a Spade, and &s;o they departed.</P>
<PB REF="16">
<P>And then wee went all to worke, &s;ome to make the Sayle, which wee made of very good <HI>Roane</HI>-cloath, and &s;ome to make the Ma&s;t: and euery one did labour all that he could, to bee ready again&s;t night: for <HI>Antonio</HI> told vs, that his Brother <HI>Angrauemart</HI> would come the next day from S. <HI>Vincent</HI> with twelue <HI>Perriagos,</HI> all laden with men and Arrowes: who&s;e words we al|way found true, for he could not di&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>And wee concluded, rather then wee would &s;tay and dye &s;o mi&s;erably at the <HI>Carrabies</HI> hands, who thir&s;ted for nothing but to eate our fle&s;h, and drinke our blood, as they had done with many other of our fellowes, wee promi&s;ed vnto the LORD (who had all this tyme fought for vs,) to betake our &s;elues vnto his mercy, and doubted not but that hee would guide vs &s;afely to &s;ome Chri&s;tian Harbour.</P>
<P>And vpon the xxvi. of September. 1605. at one a clocke after midnight, we embarqued all xix. in that little Ve&s;&s;ell or Boate which the <HI>Indians</HI> had made all of one tr&eacute;e, &s;hee was not &s;o broade as a Wherry, but it was almo&s;t as long agayne: Our Roapes for our Sayle were our Garters, and our Yard, a Lance: Sh&eacute;e had a little Rother or Helme, but not one of our com|pany had &s;kyll howe to v&s;e it, neyther had wee Com|pa&s;&s;e to direct vs, but &s;ayling by the Sunne in the day, and by the Starres in the night, k&eacute;eping al|wayes betwixt South-we&s;t and We&s;t: for wee ima|gined, the maine Land of the We&s;t-Indies lay &s;o.</P>
<P>The Victuals that wee had, were not &s;uffic&iuml;ent to &s;erue that company three dayes: for we had not aboue twentie Bi&s;kets, three <HI>Ca&s;&s;ada</HI> Cakes, a do&s;en <HI>Plan|tons,</HI> and &s;ome thirty <HI>Potatos:</HI> and of Water, &s;ome foure or fiue Gallons, &amp; a little Barrell halfe full of Rice, which Ma&s;ter <HI>Garrard</HI> had giuen him to &s;erue in the Country of <HI>Guyana,</HI> if we had gotten thyther.</P>
<PB REF="16">
<P>And as it plea&s;ed the Lord, hee had &s;aued it, vntill this our great nece&s;&s;itie for the pre&s;eruation of our liues: for all our other victuall was gone in two dayes, our water in three daies, &amp; then <HI>Richard Garrard</HI> gaue to euery two of vs a Porindi&s;h of his Rice twice a day, which wee wa&s;hed in &s;alt water &amp; &s;o eate it rawt. Thus wee continued at Sea, &s;eeking for land for the &s;pace of tenne dayes, where wee indured one great tempe&s;t, although to our great perill, looking alwayes when wee &s;hould bee &s;wallowed vp in the huge waues, the &s;torme continewing for the &s;pace of foure and twentie houres, both boy&s;terous for winde and rayne (for all the Sea was in a white foome) which was vnto vs in the mid&s;t of our danger, a great comfort: for wee &s;aued the rayne water and druncke it gladly, thanking God for that good refre&s;hing: who likewi&s;e &s;ent the very fowles of y^t ayre to l&eacute;ede vs, for they being wery of their flight, would re&s;t them on the &s;ide of our boate, &s;o that wee tooke them and dried them in the Sunne, with a little Gun|powder and eate them. Our boate was &s;o neere the wa|ter, that euery waue came ouer her reddie to &s;inke her, but that foure of vs did nothing but laue it out a|gaine by cour&s;es. To &s;peake of the mi&s;ery we indured there, it is vnpo&s;&s;ible; for I cannot expre&s;&s;e it.</P>
<P>Vpon the tenth day after our comming foorth of S. <HI>Lucea,</HI> beyng the fifth of October, one <HI>Thomas Mor|gane</HI> died, not being able to liue of that &s;mall allow|ance. And at twelue a clocke at noone wee threwe him ouer-boord: and within an houre after, it plea&s;ed God to glad vs with a ioyfull &s;ight of the land: then wee boi&s;ted vp our &s;ayle, fell to rowe with all the force wee could, making to the n&eacute;ere&s;t place, imagining all dan|gers were pa&s;t.</P>
<PB REF="17">
<P>But the winde b&eacute;eing calme, we were benighted be|fore w&eacute;e could come at it, and &s;o wanting the light of the day, wee were vpon the Rockes before wee were aware: and by rea&s;on that the breach of the waue was &s;o great and violent, we could not holde her off, but (forceably) ranne again&s;t the Rockes, and there &s;plit our Boate to the very midde&s;t, and all our men tur|ned out, I onely holding the Helme, thinking the next Waue would heaue her ouer the Rockes, not knowing her to b&eacute;e &s;plit.</P>
<P>But the Breach was &s;o great, that it turned m&eacute;e vn|der, putting mee in great danger to bee grated to pee|ces with her weyght aboue mee again&s;t the great Rockes: And at the la&s;t, wee all recouered our &s;elues, &s;ome &s;itting vpon great Rockes, others on the rootes of great Tr&eacute;es, thynking there to &s;aue our &s;elues tyll the morning: And I finding a long Poale which fell out of our Beate, tooke it and a&s;ked if any would ven|ture to the &s;hoare with mee: which <HI>Francis Brace</HI> per|ceyuing, tooke the other-ende: So we two waded to the Land, and then the re&s;t all followed, and &s;ome brought Perrywinckles in their handes, and broke them out of the &s;helles and did eate them rawe: then euery one cryed out for fre&s;h Water. So <HI>William Pickes</HI> and my &s;elfe went to &s;&eacute;eke for water: but we had not gone halfe an houre, but wee came to our Fel|lowes agayne, without finding of any Water to com|fort vs withall. So, the place where we landed, proo|ued to be a broken I&s;land incompa&s;&s;ed with the Sea, about a league from the Mayne.</P>
<P>As &s;oone as it was Day, wee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">igged pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">es in the ground for fre&s;h water, but could finde none that was to bee drunke: &s;ome went to the Boate to &s;aue &s;uch com|modyties, as were left vndriuen away with the Sea: Others found Perrywinckles on the Rockes, which
<PB REF="17"> was all the victuall wee had to eate: but our &s;tomacks were &s;o weake, we could not eate aboue two or thr&eacute;e a day. Thus not knowing what cour&s;e to take to &s;aue our liues from famine, one <HI>Myles Pet, William Pickes,</HI> and my &s;elfe went and haled the Boat out of the rockes to the &s;hore, which was &s;plit to the very mid&s;t, and &s;o far with our &s;words we cut off, &amp; put in a head in the mid&s;t, and fa&s;tned it with our Daggers, Kniues, and Bodkins, &s;topping all the leakes with our &s;hirtes.</P>
<P>So fiue of our company ventered in her to the maine land, their names were <HI>Myles Pett, William Kettlebie, William Pickes, Francis Brace,</HI> and <HI>William Butcher,</HI> leauing <HI>Richard Garrard, Philip Gla&s;cocke, Iohn Cox|ford</HI> and my &s;elfe with the re&s;t in this hungry and de&s;o|late I&s;land. And at la&s;t it plea&s;ed God to bring them to the maine land: they haled their Boate along&s;t the &s;hore, cro&s;&s;ing many great riuers, wherin they were pur|&s;ued by diuers deuouring Serpents of the Sea, as the <HI>Alligortos,</HI> who are of &s;uch force, that they will pull a hor&s;e vnder water and deuour him, and will trauell more then two leagues from the water to &s;&eacute;eke their prayes: And al&s;o that greedy <HI>Sharke,</HI> who hath thr&eacute;e rankes of t&eacute;eth &s;et like a &s;aw, and will bite off a mans thigh at one &s;natch.</P>
<P>Yet God pre&s;erued them miraculou&s;ly: And when they were like to giue ouer trauelling, being in de&s;paire for euer to find any <HI>Spaniards</HI> for to &s;uccour them with foode, God pittying their e&s;tates, guided them to a place where they found a great Earthen pot full of wheat flower, which they boyled with fre&s;h water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pot of flower &s;et in a Caue by &s;ome In|dian.</NOTE> and &s;ati&s;fied their hungry appetites with thankes to God for the &s;ame. And within two dayes after, they met with thr&eacute;e <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and with halfe a dozen <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Negros,</HI> trauelling from <HI>Carraccas</HI> to <HI>Coro,</HI> driuing hor&s;es and Mules loaden with Marchandize.</P>

<P>Who &s;&eacute;eing their weakene&s;&s;e for want of victual, vn|loaded their bea&s;ts to feed on the gra&s;&s;e, while&s;t they fed our hungry men with plentie of their good cheare, &s;hew|ing them great courte&s;ie, &s;uffering them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ide, &amp; went them&s;elues afoote two or thr&eacute;e dayes, till they came to a towne of ciuill <HI>Indians,</HI> called <HI>Tocoya,</HI> where they &s;tay|ed to refre&s;h them.</P>
<P>And there they let the <HI>Spaniards</HI> know in what mi|&s;erable ca&s;e they left vs in a de&s;olate I&s;land, where wee indured the greate&s;t mi&s;ery that euer men did and liue: for wee continued fift&eacute;ene dayes, hauing no kinde of meat but Periwinckles or Whelkes, Tobacco, &amp; Salt|water, which did nothing at all nouri&s;h vs: yet it tooke away the de&s;ire of hunger, and &s;aued vs from eating one another.</P>
<P>In that fift&eacute;ene dayes fiue of our companie pined to death for hunger: Their names were <HI>Iohn Perkins, Edward Greene, Ierome Swa&s;h, Thomas Stubs,</HI> and an olde man called <HI>Iohn.</HI> Tobacco was the chiefe food I found to do me good, and did pre&s;erue my lyfe, and tho&s;e which could take it downe, did k&eacute;epe &s;tronge&s;t, but tho&s;e which could not take it at all, died fir&s;t.</P>

<P>The Countrey there about <HI>Coro</HI> doth yeeld aboun|dance of Suger, Hony, Ginger and Pitch: Al&s;o, they haue very good Wheat growing there, but their Bread is altogether made of <HI>Maiz,</HI> of y^t which they haue great plenty: for they reape foure times a yeare.

<P>Our entertainment was &s;uch, that we could not de&s;ire to part from them, to come into our owne countrey, without offending them: For there being a Frigat at <HI>Coro,</HI> redy to go for <HI>Carthagena,</HI> foure of vs made en|treaty for pa&s;&s;age, which was <HI>Philip Gla&s;cocke, Ri|chard Garrard, William Pickes</HI> and my &s;elfe, all the re&s;t being in the Countrey vpon plea&s;ure, &s;ome in one place and &s;ome in another, and when the Ship was redy to depart, our <HI>Signiours</HI> per&s;waded the Gouernour not to let vs go, without he had a Letter from the Vice-Roy,
<PB REF="20"> that wee might pa&s;&s;e in &s;afety into Spaine, and &s;o for England: and then he &s;hewed them a Letter, that it was at our owne choice, whether we would go or tarry: yet becau&s;e they were loath to part with vs, they willed the Fathers of their churches to tell vs, that if we would &s;tay, wee &s;hould bee as them&s;elues, and they would wyllingly be&s;tow their Daughters and their goods vp|on vs.</P>
<P>Al&s;o they told vs, that now England &amp; Spayn were all one in Religion, and that our Sauiour Chri&s;t came in a Vi&s;ion vpon the Cro&s;&s;e, and appeared before our Kings Maie&s;tie, and told him that hee was in an error, and byd hym turne, and bee as the Catholickes are, for they are good Chri&s;tians: and how at the &s;ight there|of, three of our chiefe By&s;hoppes were &s;trucke into a traunce for the &s;pace of three dayes, and after they re|couered agayne, they preached that they &s;hould all re|pent and become Catholickes: adding further, that the King had &s;ent to the Pope, to &s;end learned men into England, to teach their Doctrine aright, which we well perceyued, was onely the &s;ugge&s;tion of their Popi&s;h Prie&s;tes, thereby to haue made vs hearken to ther Do|ctrine: yet notwith&s;tanding all their allurements on both &s;ides, our de&s;ire was for our owne Coun|trey: And &s;o, three procured meanes for to go.</P>

As to <HI>Don Pedro de Barres,</HI> who was his &s;onne in Law, but it tooke &s;mall effect: for as &s;oone as wee arriued there (which was the &s;ixth of May, within foure dayes after, we were co~mit|ted to Pry&s;on for Spies by the <HI>Tenientie:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The x. of May we were co~|mitted. 1066.</NOTE> for the Gouer|nour was dead, not thr&eacute;e dayes before we came: yet we carried one Letter fro~ <HI>Coro,</HI> written by <HI>Signior Ge&s;per San&s;ious,</HI> in our behalf, to <HI>Signior Antonio Ca~bero,</HI> who prooued a &s;pecial friend to vs: for we had not be~ an houre in pri&s;o~, but he came to vs &amp; comforted vs, &amp; bid vs not to feare, for we &s;hould not want any thing wherin he could plea&s;ure vs: &s;o he went to the <HI>Tenientie,</HI> &amp; profered 3. of his <HI>Negros</HI> to &s;et vs at lybertie: &amp; if we made an e&s;cape, he &s;hould haue tho&s;e <HI>Negros</HI> for his owne v&s;e.</P>
<P>The woor&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Negros</HI> was woorth 300. Duc|cates: but he would not, neither would he allow vs any Victualles.</P>
<P>But this <HI>Canbero</HI> &s;ent vs euery day at noone one very good meales meat.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, there were thr&eacute;e Engli&s;hmen, who &s;erued as Marryners in the King of Spaynes Galliounes of Plate, who after that they were at Sea, were by a very great tempe&s;t of weather dryuen backe agayne to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> in great danger to be &s;uncke: for &s;he had twelue foote water within her: &s;ome of them e&s;caped to the <HI>Hauanna,</HI> and fiue of their mo&s;t riche&s;t Gallionus were in the Shoaldes betwixt <HI>Carthagena</HI> and the <HI>Ha|uanna</HI> lo&s;t: the&s;e thr&eacute;e Engli&s;h men did allow vs twelue pence a day, &s;o long as wee remayned in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Euery Saturday, the <HI>Tenientie</HI> doth &s;it vpon mat|ters concerning the Pry&s;oners, with his <HI>Alcaldes</HI> or Iu&s;tices.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tenientie</HI> commaunded, that we &s;hould be &s;ent
<PB REF="21"> to the Gallyes. Then one <HI>Alcalde</HI> who was alway found a fauourer of Engli&s;h men, his name was <HI>Sig|nior Franci&s;co Lopus de Moralis,</HI> called for our Exami|nation, which when he had peru&s;ed, he told him that he could not with Iu&s;tice commit vs. Who an&s;wered a|gayne, Then let them remayne in pry&s;on, vntil the <HI>Gal|liouns</HI> come from Spaine for the Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Then, within two Moneths after, a Deputy Gouer|nour was cho&s;en,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who was Pri|&s;oner al&s;o.</NOTE> vnto whome a Portyngall (who was our great friend in the pry&s;on) framed a Petition, which was deliuered by <HI>Iohn Frengham</HI> our Countrey-man. Who&s;e An&s;were was to him, that if we could procure a|ny Spaniards to bayle vs for our foorth comming, we &s;hould be at liberty.</P>
<P>Which graunt, <HI>Signiour Franci&s;co Lopus</HI> and <HI>Anto|nio Cambero</HI> had no &s;ooner heard of, but they entred in Bond of a thou&s;and Duccates for our foorth-comming.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e, why <HI>Franci&s;co Lopus</HI> did this for vs, was becau&s;e Captaine <HI>Drake,</HI> when he tooke <HI>Carthagena,</HI> did &s;aue all his fathers goods, and his life withall.</P>
<P>And at our deliuery, the <HI>Tenientie</HI> told vs, that al|though by order of Lawe, they could iu&s;tly haue put vs to death: Yet &s;eing God had &s;o myraculou&s;ly &s;aued vs, and that wee had indured &s;o many mi&s;eries to &s;aue our liues, and that onely we came to them for &s;uccour and re|liefe, they were content to &s;et vs at libertie.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Franci&s;co Lopus</HI> brought vs a di&s;charge from the Gouernor to the Iayler for our deliuery out of pry|&s;on, and brought vs all thr&eacute;e to his owne hou&s;e, where was prouided for euery of vs a &s;euerall bedde, for the country is &s;o hot, wee cannot lye but one in a bed. Our entertainement was great, and all our &s;eruices in plate, with great varietie of meates, and all the mo&s;t delicious
<PB REF="21"> <HI>Indians</HI> fruites what&s;oeuer, and yet he thought wee neuer fared well, without hee &s;ent vs one extraordi|nary di&s;h or other from his owne table. Al&s;o many Gallants re&s;orted to his hou&s;e to play at Cardes, who would &s;hewe them&s;elues very liberall vnto vs at their winning.</P>
<P>There wee continued in great plea&s;ure, vntill the Galliouns were readie to goe for <HI>Spaine</HI> with the trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Citty of <HI>Carthagena</HI> is a place of great force, for by Land, you can not come to it, but one way, which is &s;trongly garded: it is (almo&s;t) encompa&s;|&s;ed with the Sea: It hath foure Ca&s;tels, two at the entrance of the Harbour, and one within, where Chaynes are drawne acro&s;&s;e the water. The fourth is within the Citty, where their Court of guarde is kept, of 500. Souldiers: and it hath foure Churches.</P>
<P>The day before we embarqued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 25</NOTE> there came two more of our company from <HI>Coro,</HI> which was <HI>Miles Pet</HI> and <HI>Richard Farne. Franci&s;co Lopus</HI> procured vs pa&s;&s;age in thr&eacute;e &s;eueral Ships: <HI>Philip Gla&s;cocke, Miles Pet</HI> and <HI>Richard Farne</HI> in the Ship, called <HI>St. Bartholomew: Richard Garrard,</HI> in <HI>La Madre de Deos:</HI> my &s;elfe in <HI>La Santa Cru&s;e.</HI> So we were a moneth in &s;ayling to the <HI>Hauanna,</HI> which is neere thr&eacute;e hundred Leagues from <HI>Carthagena.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the <HI>Hauanna,</HI> we liued al a&s;hore with eight&eacute;ene pence a day for our dyet.</P>
<P>It is a place of great &s;trength, for it hath <HI>I.</HI> great Ca&s;tle built vpo~ the Rocks at y^e entrance of the Har|bour, and another within on the other &s;ide, which com|maund all the Towne and Harbour: And the thr&eacute;e within the towne, where <HI>Don Pedro de Valdes</HI> was Gouernor, which was Pri&s;oner in the Tower 1588.</P>
<PB REF="22">
<P>There they victualled the Flat, and watered and repayred their &s;hippes, &amp; becau&s;e they had no victuall to &s;erue all the Fl&eacute;ete, they left two &s;hips there, the out whereof was that wherein our three men were pla|ced, called the <HI>S. Bartholomew:</HI> the other the S. <HI>Vin|cent.</HI> And about the tenth of October, w&eacute;e departed for <HI>Spaine</HI> by the <HI>Bermouthos,</HI> and &s;hot the Gulfe of <HI>Florida</HI> in eight dayes again&s;t the wind, and &s;o w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> were nine weekes in &s;ayling betwixt the <HI>Hauanna,</HI> and the coa&s;t of <HI>Spaine:</HI> the tempe&s;t and &s;tormes w&eacute;e had were wonderfull great, in &s;o much that all the Fl&eacute;ete were di&s;per&s;ed, and not aboue two &s;hippes did hold co~pany together, which put them in great feare, le&s;t they &s;hould haue met with the Flemings, who might with thr&eacute;e good &s;hips haue taken all their trea|&s;ure with &s;mall adoe: for euery little Caruill did put them in feare, thinking her to be a man of warre.</P>
<P>And within thr&eacute;e dayes before we came in &s;ight of <HI>Spaine,</HI> we ouertooke one of the company, which had b&eacute;ene long wanting. And the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Santa Cru&s;e,</HI> wherein I was, thinking to welcome her with a peale of Ordinance, went him&s;elf without the ports to charge a peece, and &s;uddenly fell into the Sea, and before we could bring the &s;hip a&s;&s;ayes, he was drow|ned.</P>
<P>And vpon the fiftenth of <HI>December</HI> w&eacute;e came a|gain&s;t the barre of <HI>Saint Lucas,</HI> but could not enter, becau&s;e the winde was contrarie. Then came the Gallies out of <HI>Cales,</HI> and towed vs into <HI>Cales,</HI> where they vnloded the trea&s;ure. This made well for vs which were pry&s;oners: for they were &s;o bu&s;ie with the Plate, that they neuer regarded vs: for when the Captaine and Souldiours were gone with it, we went a&s;hore to <HI>Cales</HI> without controulment: And
<PB REF="22"> when I thought to haue b&eacute;ene &s;ecure, the Captaine, with whome I came home by chance, met me in the &s;tr&eacute;ete, and called me to him, and &s;aid, that I did know how that I was deliuered vnto him as pri&s;oner, and willed me to come to him in <HI>Saint Lucas,</HI> and there he would &s;&eacute;eke a di&s;charge for me. And I promi&s;ed him that I would come: but afterward I feared that hee would haue deliuered me to the Iu&s;tice; &amp; &s;o not da|ring to tru&s;t him, I neuer came in his fight more, but &s;ought all meanes for my pa&s;&s;age, which I found har|der to get, then when I was in the <HI>Indies:</HI> for our owne Cou~trimen would an&s;wer vs, that they would not in danger them&s;elues, to take vs, without we had a di&s;charge from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Who&s;e vncomfortable &s;peeches did much di&s;may vs: &s;o we remained in <HI>Cales,</HI> in Saint <HI>Lucas,</HI> and in <HI>Siuill,</HI> without any hope of pa&s;&s;age, one moneth and more, at the charge of <HI>Iohn Frendgeham, Willi|am Gourdon, Ioh Dane,</HI> who was chiefe Trumpeter of the Spani&s;h Fl&eacute;ete, and <HI>Iohn Painter,</HI> a Mu&s;ician: And at the la&s;t, (de&s;payring of pa&s;&s;age) M. <HI>Garrard</HI> got pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Sandwitch:</HI> And my &s;elfe made moane to Ma&s;ter <HI>Barwicke,</HI> Ma&s;ter of a little Ship of <HI>Welles</HI> in <HI>Norfolke,</HI> called, The <HI>George,</HI> who at the fir&s;t word, graunted m&eacute;e pa&s;&s;age. So on the &s;econd day of February, 1606. hee landed me &s;afely at y^e <HI>Downes,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> giuing me two &s;hillings to bring me to <HI>Lon|don.</HI></P>
