<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Saturday la&s;t the <HI>Dartmouth</HI> Frigate left the <HI>Lough</HI> before <HI>London-Derry,</HI> being &s;ent by Major-General <HI>Kirk,</HI> and Ye&s;terday Morning &s;he came into <HI>Hylake,</HI> and confirm'd the happy News of the Relief of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> that Day &s;he came away.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances were, That Major-General <HI>Kirk</HI> having an Account &s;ent him out, that the Town was in mo&s;t mi&s;erable Di&s;tre&s;s, and by no means capable of holding out above one Week longer, and that they had for &s;ome con&s;iderable time before, fed up|on Cats, Dogs, Raw-Hides, and the like; and of that &s;ort of Provi&s;ion very &s;carce: And that there had already peri&s;hed in the Town for want, and Sickne&s;s occa&s;ioned thereby, &s;everal hundreds of Souls: And that there was not in the Town then well, above three Thou&s;and fighting Men. The Major-General re&s;olved to hazard the lo&s;s of all for its Relief, &s;ent three Ships with Provi&s;ion, Ammunition, and four hundred Men to break the Boom, and on that &s;ide relieve it by Water, which God was plea&s;ed to ble&s;s with de&s;ired Succe&s;s; for one of them fitted for that purpo&s;e running upon
<PB REF="2">the Boome, at one Streak made entrance for the re&s;t to follow; however not without annoyance from the Forts, who de&s;troyed &s;ome of their Men. In the mean time the Major-General re&s;olved to try his Fortune by Land, and in order thereunto, at low Water, in three di&s;tinct Battalions, marched all the Forces he had got together in the I&s;le of <HI>Inch,</HI> into the I&s;le of <HI>Enni&s;|killing,</HI> wherein <HI>Derry</HI> &s;tands; which the Papi&s;ts perceiving, did not think fit to try <HI>Kirk's</HI> Kindne&s;s, but forthwith &s;et all they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of (which they could not carry with them) on Fire, and run away by the light of it, over <HI>Claudiford,</HI> to the re&s;t of their Party on the other &s;ide, and left <HI>Kirk</HI> way clear, without Re&s;i&s;tance, to march into <HI>Derry.</HI> But tho&s;e brave Soules, tho almo&s;t fami&s;hed, perceiving their Intent and Motion, re&s;ol|ved to pay their way, to tho&s;e Cowardly and Bloody Men, and upon their Retreate I&s;&s;ued out of the Town, and with that Force and Bravery fell up|on them, that they Kil'd more then their own Number, and put them into &s;uch Con&s;ternation that many of their Enemies were drowned by their ha&s;t to get over the River.</P>
<P>While the&s;e were in this Flight, their other Party, on the other&s;ide of the River, blew up the Fort, and as the others had done before, &s;et all on fire and &s;o marched thence with the lo&s;s of 20000 Men, (as is believed) &s;ince their fir&s;t &s;itting down before that Invincible place; which mu&s;t needs be conceived purely to be pre&s;erved by Divine Providence only; when in kil|ling &s;o many of their Enemy, they had not kill'd of the Town above 50 Per&s;ons; but all the lo&s;s they have had, has been for want, and by Sick|ne&s;s: But the greate&s;t Providence was, that when all Relief had failed them, and tho&s;e poor Souls reduced to the brink of Extremity, that God was plea&s;ed to make, even their very Enemies mo&s;t mi&s;cheivous De&s;igns produce Food, out of their fiery Engines, to feed tho&s;e poor Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and Starving Per&s;ons; thus when they were even ju&s;t ready to fall upon and Eat one another rather than fall into their Enemies Hands; A Bomb, &s;hot by the Enemy into the Town, fell into the hou&s;e of a Papi&s;t, and, as if de&s;igned by Heaven, tore with that Violence that none before ever had done there, till it at length found out and made way into a larg Vault, long before fill'd, and made privately up, with Provi&s;ion, by (as its thought) their late Governour <HI>Lundee;</HI> wherein they thus found (before they got any other in their greate&s;t Extremity) Provi&s;ion enough to enable them to hold out a Month longer, than through Mercy they found occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>It is worthy Ob&s;ervation, that by the account they had in <HI>Dublin</HI> of the Rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Derry</HI> 2 Days before it was done, which I before &s;ent you that it was Intended, tho not then done, for fear of an Inva&s;ion from <HI>England.</HI> There hath been 5 or 6 other Acts pa&s;t in <HI>Ireland,</HI> be&s;ides what I &s;ent you la&s;t; of which the&s;e are Part, 1&s;t. To take away the be|nefit of the Clergy from Thieves and Robbers. 2d. To &s;eize the effects of all Ab&s;entees. 3d. To take away St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Church in <HI>Dublin,</HI> as being built upon Ab&s;entees Land. So well doth King <HI>James</HI> keep his Word in pre&s;erving the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Papi&s;ts that were pri&s;on'd in this Town, in the Ca&s;tle, upon &s;ome new ploting found among them, are &s;ent from thence to a other Pri&s;on in the City. And the Mayor of <HI>Liverpool</HI> with 3 or 4 others in that place are &s;u&s;pected, and &s;ome &s;ay Apprehended and taken into Cu&s;tody, for &s;ome undue practices and Contrivances again&s;t the Government.</P>
<P>Food was &s;o &s;carce at <HI>London-Derry,</HI> that a Dogs-head was &s;old for &s;even Shillings.</P>
