<HEAD>A TRUE ACCOUNT Of the ACTIONS With the whole Defeat Of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army AT VIENNA By the IMPERIALLISTS.</HEAD>
<P>From the Imperial Camp about four miles from Vienna <HI>September</HI> the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> has Joyned us, and all things are di&s;po&s;ing for the relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which continues to make a very brave Defence; however the Garri&s;on is much weakned, and therefore the Governor has let the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Lorrain</HI> know, that no time is to be lo&s;t. You have already had an account o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Action we were Ingaged in again&s;t a body of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> on the 24th pa&s;t, to which we cannot add any thing, unle&s;s it be to doe right to the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Subjects, who had a &s;hare in it. Count <HI>Tafe</HI> Commanded in the left wing and gave Eminent proofs of his Courage and Conduct, and the Lord Lansdowne, who was with him, with other Volontiers; did di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf with great Gallentry in the hotte&s;t of Action.</P>
<P>Lintz <HI>September</HI> the 9th The 6 In&s;tant the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> returned hither from the Army, (which pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> the 3.4. and 5th In&s;tant, at a place called Stetzdort) and gave the Emperor an account of the re&s;olution that have been taken for the Relief of <HI>Vienna:</HI> That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was to march with the Van to|wards <HI>Maurbach</HI> and <HI>Maur,</HI> the main body commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to|wards <HI>walkersdorf,</HI> and Count <HI>waldecke</HI> with the Rear towards Clo&s;ter Neuburg, That they intended to attack the enemy on <HI>Sunday</HI> next, &amp; that the Chri&s;tian Army con&s;i&s;ts of 85000 Fighting men. The 6 in&s;tant arrived here the Elector of Bavaria, who parted again from hence ye&s;terday with the Emperor for Clo&s;ter Neubourg. Before his Imperial Maje&s;ty went hence, he received advice that the <HI>Turks</HI> had the 7 in&s;tant Sprung two mines, one whereof made a Breach in the Ba&s;tion of Lebels and that thereupon they made a very furious a&s;&s;ault, in which they were repul&s;ed. However the place begins to be in great danger, as we know by the &s;igns the be|&s;ieged have made. The 7 the Empere&s;s was brought to Bed of a <HI>Daughter.</HI> From Hungary we have advice that Prince Abafty, as likewi&s;e the Princes <HI>Walachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> have orders from the Grand V&s;iier to remain with their Troops near <HI>Raab</HI> to hinder the Incur&s;ions of that Garri&s;on and of Comorra, and to &s;ecure the Convoys That go to the Turki&s;h Army</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P><HI>Rati&s;bonne September</HI> 13th we have Letters from the Imperial Army near <HI>Mautern</HI> of the &s;ixth In&s;tant which &s;ay; That the next Morning they were to March into the Tolne fields, where they were to expect the Troops of Franconia and Saxony; and the Letters from Lintz of the 9 tell us, that the Turks were ma|&s;ters of the Ditch of <HI>Vienna</HI> that they had &s;prung two Great Mines; one of which did not &s;ucceed, but the other blew up the point of the Lebel Ba&s;tion, and that thereup|on they made a very fierce a&s;&s;ault, but that they were repul&s;ed with Con&s;iderable Lo&s;&s;e That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> were Marching to relieve the place (which began to be in great Di&s;tre&s;s) and that the whole Army was Compa&s;&s;ed of 64 <HI>Battalions</HI> of Foot, 500 in each, and 162 &s;quadrons of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, in each 220 which amounts to 32000 Foot and 32400 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, in all 64400 men</P>
<P>Ratisbonne <HI>September</HI> 16 &s;everal Couriers have pa&s;&s;ed through this place &s;ince ye&s;terday Morning; coming from <HI>Vienna</HI> and from the Imperial Army, by whome we are informed That on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 12th in&s;tant, the Chri&s;tian Army attacked the Turks in their Camp, and totaly defeated them, that their Foot were all cut in pieces and their Hor&s;e fled, leaving their Bagage; Cannon, Tents, and all they had behind them, that the Emperial Army &s;tood in Batalia all the Night following that they might be in a po&s;ture to receive the Enemy, in ca&s;e they &s;hould rally again; That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> with his Troops and &s;ome of the Germans, were gone in per&s;uit of them, and were not returned to the Imperial Army on <HI>Munday</HI> Noon; at which time Liberty was given to the Souldiers to &s;trip the Enemies dead; its &s;aid the Imperialli&s;ts have not lo&s;t above 4 or 500 men; and that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> has taken two Hor&s;e Tails (which are the Turks &s;ignals of War) as like|wi&s;e the Grand Vi&s;iers &s;tandard; and his own Hor&s;e, but that it is not yet known what is become of him&s;elf; the Letters we expect to morrow will give us with more certainty the particulers of this great Action</P>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els <HI>September</HI> the one and twentieth: La&s;t Night arrived here a Gentleman from the Imperial Army, who brought the great and happy news of the rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Vienna</HI> and the total defeat of the Tur|ki&s;h Army on Sunday the 12th in&s;tant, of which he gives us the&s;e particulars. That the Chri&s;tian Army con&s;i&s;ted of 40000 Hor&s;e, and the like number of Foot, That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> commanded the Right Wing. the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> ac|companied with the Electors of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the main Body, and Prince <HI>Waldecke,</HI> the Prince <HI>de Salme,</HI> Prince <HI>Louis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Bran|denburg, Bareith,</HI> the Left Wing; That the whole Army advanced in this order of Battle towards the Turki&s;h Camp with &s;everal &s;mall Parties of Hor&s;e and Dragoons before them to clear the way; That the Grand Vi&s;ier had drawn up his Army within his Camp, having &s;everal advanced Bodies of Hor&s;e and Foot to defend their Retrenchments, and had they made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, it would have been difficult to have forced their Camp; but that the&s;e advanced Bodies&punc; not being well &s;econded, gave way, and put their main Body into di&s;|order; That the Chri&s;tians having without much oppo&s;ition entred the Ene|mies Camp, their Hor&s;e immediately fled, and the Grand Vi&s;ier with them, That their Foot, being between 20 and 25000 men, made a con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance; but being environed by the Chri&s;tians, were all cut in pieces; That the Poli&s;h Hor&s;e pur&s;ued the Enemies Cavalry till night, and killed many of them, and
<PB N="4" REF="2" MS="y">intended to continue the pur&s;uit the next day; That the Enemies Camp infinitely rich That all their Baggage and Cannon are taken, with 60000 Tents, and that in that of the Grands Vi&s;iers, was found two Millions of Money. That <HI>Vienna</HI> was brought to the la&s;t extremity, and could have held out but four days longer, the Gari&s;on being reduced from 15000 to 5000 men; However they made a very brisk Sally at the time the Chri&s;tians entred the Turki&s;h Camp, and killed many of the Turks that were &s;till in the Trenches. Tis &s;aid the Enemy lo&s;t during the Siege 70000 men, be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;lain on this great day. Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> has given the Marquis <HI>de Grana</HI> a &s;hort account of their Deliverance, having Writ his Letter upon one of the Enemies Cannon. We were told that nei|ther <HI>Teckeley</HI> nor <HI>Abafti</HI> was in the Turki&s;h Army, and that there was not one <HI>Tartar</HI> found among them. In our next we may be able to give you a more parti|cular Relation of this great and &s;ignal Victory, which co&s;t the Chri&s;tians not above 3 or 400 men; among whom are no Per&s;ons of any note, except the Duke <HI>de Crov's</HI> Brother, and the Count <HI>de Tratman&s;dorf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bru&s;els Sept.</HI> 1. It is hard to expre&s;s the Joy we are here in occa&s;ioned by the news we have of the entire Defeate of the Turki&s;h Army; We fir&s;t heard it from a Courier which arrived here ye&s;terday morning from <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw,</HI> but in the Evening we had the certainty of it by an Officer who came from the Imperial Camp, and from <HI>Vienna</HI> the 13. in&s;t. the day after this Memorable Action, He tells us That the 12. about ten in the morning, the Chri&s;tian Army attaked the Tur|ki&s;h Camp. That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> made the attack on the &s;ide of the Empre&s;&s;es Hou&s;e called <HI>la Favorite,</HI> where the Grand Vi&s;ier had his Quarters; The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> on the &s;ide of the Ba&s;tion of the <HI>Court,</HI> and Prince <HI>Waldecke</HI> on that of the Scotch Gate. That having without any great oppo&s;ition entred the Ene|mies Camp, their Hor&s;e fled, and the Foot was all de&s;troyed, and all their Baggage Cannon, Tents and Trea&s;ure taken; during this action the Be&s;ieged Sallied out, and fell upon the Jani&s;&s;aries, who, as is &s;aid, to the number of 10000 had that day the Guard of the Trenches, and were in the po&s;ts again&s;t the Town, and, being likewi&s;e attackt on the &s;ide of the Army, none of them e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The Mare&s;chal <HI>d'Eumieres</HI> continues &s;till at <HI>Le&s;&s;ine&s;s;</HI> On Sunday la&s;t &s;ome Squadrons of French Hor&s;e were at <HI>Alo&s;t</HI> and <HI>A&s;ch,</HI> and carried away &s;everal of the Inhabitans for refu&s;ing to pay the Contributions they demanded, 4000 Ducth Foot, and 2000 Hor&s;e are encamped between <HI>Malines</HI> and <HI>Doffle.</HI> and 2000 Foot more are marching to <HI>Gaunt</HI> to remain in Gari&s;on there under the Command of Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' Auvergue.</HI> The Cavalry of this Gari&s;on are drawn within the Coun|ter&s;carp, and encamped along the dry Ditch, and all the lower part about the Town is laid under water.
