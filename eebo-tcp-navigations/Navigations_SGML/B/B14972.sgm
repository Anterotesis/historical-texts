<P>FRrom Vienna is written the <HI>2.</HI> hereof, that <HI>1000</HI> of the Emperors &s;ouldiers hor&s;e and loote, were &s;ent out of his army with <HI>500.</HI> waggons to the Hoye to fetch in forrage, and hauing laden their wagons with hay, corne, and oates, were &s;et vpon by the Hungers: who though they en&s;conced them&s;elues within their wagons, and &s;toutly defende them, yet in the end, the Hungars ouercame and fiue them, &s;et fire on the wagons, tooke many pri&s;oners and few e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on in Pre&s;burge are <HI>5000.</HI> &s;trong who defend the towne valiantly hauing &s;allied out vp|on <HI>Bethlems</HI> army, and &s;et vpon tho&s;e that lay en|&s;conced in the &s;uburbs, beat and &s;lue <HI>200.</HI> of them &amp; nayled vp foure peeces of artillery being not able to carry them away, yet finding them&s;elues too weake to &s;tay, hauing lo&s;t many of their company were glad to retire. The like attempt they made ye&s;terday vpon the &s;conce of <HI>Bethlems</HI> at my, but with the lo&s;&s;e of ma|ny of the Neapolitans were forced to retire. In the meane time the Budian Hungers rob and ran&s;ack the countrey euen within two miles of this citty Vienna, all ouer betweene that and New&s;tad, where they haue burnt downe to the ground <HI>20.</HI> of the Em|perors &s;peciall villages and dorpes, killed many of the people, driuing away the cattle with them, very pittifull to behold. So as in the&s;e quarters no body tarryeth in any pari&s;hes or hamlets, and there is no &s;afe pa&s;&s;ing to New&s;tad and Stermarke: vnto the&s;e proceedings there is none to oppo&s;e, which maketh this city to be pe&s;tered with beggars and poore people where many &s;tarue with hunger, whereby appeareth the wrath of God to be ouer the&s;e countries.</P>
