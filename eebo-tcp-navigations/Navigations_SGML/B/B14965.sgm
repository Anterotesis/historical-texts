<HEAD>The Continuation of our Weekely NEWES. The Extract of an Oration of his Maje&s;tie of <HI>Swe|den,</HI> made in the pre&s;ence of his cheife&s;t <HI>Peeres, Earles, Lords, Warlike Commaunders,</HI> and other Officers, on the 10. of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> 1632. neere the City of <HI>Norimbergh.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_HIS Royall Maje&s;tie of <HI>Sweden</HI> cau&s;ed all his Commanders and Officers from the high|e&s;t to the lowe&s;t to come before him, and made an Oration vnto them of an houre long, concerning the pillaging and robbing, and &s;ome in&s;olencies committed by his Souldiers: which his &s;aid Maje&s;tie labouring to &s;uppre&s;&s;e, v|&s;ed in this his Oration &s;uch motiues and arguments, that his earne&s;t and eloquent expre&s;&s;ion forced teares from the eyes of many of his chiefe Commaunders. The Contents whereof you haue in this Extract.</P>
<P>You Peeres, Earles, and Lords, Yee are partly of tho&s;e, who haue &s;hewed them&s;elues vnfaithfull and di&s;loyall to your owne Countrey, and doe helpe to ruinate the &s;ame. You Ge|neralls, Lieutenant-Generalls, (and all you the re&s;t inferiour Officers) I haue ever held and e&s;teemed you for vpright and &s;tout Cavalliers, and I doe witne&s;&s;e for you, that vpon occa|&s;ion offered, you haue in fighting given &s;uch demon&s;tration of your valour, as that I haue therewithall re&s;ted &s;atisfied.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>But when I doe behold you pre&s;ent here before me, and doe con&s;ider of, and call to mind your &s;tealing, robbing, and pilla|ging, and that ye al&s;o doe participate, and are guiltie of tho&s;e in&s;olencies, and ob&s;erue no di&s;cipline, nor doe no ju&s;tice, all my haires doe &s;tand an end. Is not this a dolefull ca&s;e and la|mentable, and odious in the &s;ight of God, that one Chri&s;tian and joynt religious, one friend another, yea one brother &s;hall pillage and ran&s;acke another, and &s;poile, and ruinate, and vn|doe another: the Devills in hell doe &s;hew more loue, and are more tru&s;tie one to another, then you Chri&s;tians are among your &s;elues.</P>
<P>My heart faileth mee, and my bowels yearne within mee, when I doe heare that the <HI>Swedi&s;b</HI> Souldiers are more in&s;olent then tho&s;e of the enemy: when indeed not <HI>Swedes,</HI> but the <HI>Germanes</HI> commit the in&s;olencies: had I knowne that ye had beene of &s;uch an humour, and had borne no more affection to your owne natiue Countrey, and that you would haue done no better &s;ervice for the &s;ame, nor &s;hewed more fidelitie: I had never &s;o much as &s;adled an hor&s;e for your &s;akes, much le&s;&s;e ever haue adventured my Kingdome, my life and goods, and with mine owne per&s;on haue adventured &s;o many &s;tout and valorous men for your welfare: but I would rather &s;ince I perceiue that you aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ct and de&s;ire it, haue &s;uffered you to re|maine plunged in the greate&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ervitude and &s;laverie. Yee know full well, that I do not ea&s;ily or &s;light|ly denie any of you any rea&s;onable reque&s;t, &amp; my God know|eth, that I never intend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d any other thing, but (by his ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance) to re&s;tore every man to their owne, and their own to them: and for the remainder, e&s;pecially what I obtaine in <HI>Franconia</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to di&s;tribute and impart among you, and to leaue none of you vnrecompenced for your faithfull &s;ervice: but your accur&s;ed and divelli&s;h robbing and &s;tealing doth hinder and keepe me backe in all my Chri&s;tian intenti|ons. Can you not con&s;ider what prai&s;e and fame po&s;teritie will leaue you in future hi&s;tories? what a burthen you will lay on your owne con&s;ciences? and what judgements and
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"> puni&s;hments you draw vpon your &s;elues, your po&s;teritie, the whole Countrey, and tho&s;e that &s;hall &s;ucceed you? Oh that you doe not con&s;ider, what an account you are to yeelde vp at that great and dreadfull day of account. I would rather haue remained within mine owne Kingdome, than I would longer behold &s;uch ba&s;e in&s;olencies. Perchance you may &s;ay, you want monies; but when I haue the meanes to &s;atisfie both you, and the whole Armie, and you by pillaging, rob|bing, and &s;tealing depriue me of tho&s;e meanes, I be&s;eech you than where is the fault? What doe I receiue of all your prey? ju&s;t nothing. I doe prote&s;t before God, and it is truth, that of all this warre I haue not &s;o much enriched my &s;elfe as the worth of a paire of bootes; and I profe&s;&s;e withall, that I would rather ride without bootes, than any wayes in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure to enrich my &s;elfe by the lo&s;&s;e and prejudice of other poore men. I will make it appeare to you, and to tho&s;e that de&s;ire therein to be &s;atisfied, that I haue had made over vnto me &s;ince I came out of mine owne Kingdome, at 32. &s;everall times, aboue 40. tunne of Gold, which I haue &s;pent for your good, and the re&s;tauration of tho&s;e that are vnited with mee in the true Religion. I confe&s;&s;e I might herein bee &s;ilent, but the con&s;ideration of the great lo&s;&s;e that I haue &s;u&s;tained of &s;o many braue Worthies and Cavalleres, who&s;e vertues indeed were beyond e&s;timation, con&s;trained mee to &s;peake what I doe; and truely I valued them beyond all my wealth. And for your parts what haue you contributed? I de&s;ire nothing at your hands but onely this, that you depriue and rob not o|thers of their goods, but leaue vnto every man his owne.</P>
<P>This Oration which was in part penned by many, tooke vp divers &s;heetes of paper. This is but onely the extract and part of it.</P>
<P>After the Oration ended, his Maje&s;tie made &s;trict prohibi|tion, and added therevnto a commination, that hee would &s;pare none hence-forward, Peere, nor Earle, Generall, nor Commander. And in ca&s;e they &s;hould mutinie, hee with his
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y"> <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Finlanders</HI> would vndertake &s;o to rattle them, that the very &s;hivers &s;hould flie about. Which prohibition was no &s;ooner proclaimed with the &s;ound of trumpets, but hee cau&s;ed a Lieutenant to be hanged for commiting &s;ome of the afore&s;aid in&s;olencies.</P>
<P>When as a certaine Pe&s;ant or Countryman came and made complaint to his Maje&s;tie of &s;ome Souldiers who had robbed him of a Cow; his Maje&s;tie him&s;elfe in per&s;on rod along with him to find out the parties: when hee &s;hewed his Ma|je&s;tie where the Cow was notwith&s;tanding the Captaine &amp; Lieutenant excu&s;ed the partie, he cau&s;ed him to be brought to the Provo&s;t, and delivered vp into the hands of Iu&s;tice; But there was earne&s;t interce&s;&s;ion made for him by the Comman|ders and Captaines vnto his Maje&s;tie, who with compa&s;&s;ion &s;pake thus vnto the Delinquent: My &s;onne, it is better that I &s;hould puni&s;h you, than that for your mi&s;-deedes the wrath of God and his Iudgments &s;hould fall vpon me, and thee, and all of vs.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Norimberg</HI> the <HI>2.</HI> of Augu&s;t, <HI>1632.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Concerning my dolefull e&s;tate I doubt not but all the world is therewith acquainted, In the&s;e 4. weekes we haue recei|ved no letters from <HI>Overland</HI> nor <HI>Aug&s;burg:</HI> The Enemy is rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d about vs with two great Armies, and is enquartered a|bout <HI>Steyn,</HI> and <HI>Eyba,</HI> and the &s;ame River a mile from this Ci|tie, and as farre from the Army. We can daily &s;ee the Enemy &s;warue to and from our Steeple. The skirmi&s;hes continue daily, and many Spies are brought pri&s;oners hither: which Spies are pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ikely examined, by which meanes we know all the Enemies de&s;ignes and enterpri&s;es. Ye&s;terday was brought pri&s;oner here the Generall Quarter-Mai&s;ter of <HI>Wallen&s;teyn,</HI> who had the bed-role or Catalogue about him of <HI>Wallen&s;teyns</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bavarias</HI> whole Armie; he is daily &s;erved at
<PB N="5" REF="4"> Table with 6. &s;ilver di&s;hes of good cheare, and 2. bottels of wine; he and his doe all complaine of extreame hunger and want in their Armies.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;tie of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;hews him&s;elfe wondrous curteous and loving towards all the Citizens here, &amp; remaines excee|ding couragious. His Army is very well fortified, in&s;omuch, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any enemy to rai&s;e the &s;ame, or almo&s;t to oppo&s;e him; notwith&s;tanding his Army alone is none of the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> doe daily defeate &s;ome of the Enemies Con|voyes: and although I confe&s;&s;e indeed by rea&s;on of the&s;e trou|bles and turmoiles our trading cea&s;eth, yet God bee prai&s;ed: wee are exceeding well provided of all things. It doth very much animate and comfort vs, that his Maje&s;tie is &s;o chea|rie and tender of vs, and doth &s;o couragiou&s;ly protect vs, and e&s;tabli&s;heth decent and good order overall.</P>

Hee there burnt a great multitude of Corne, which was enough to &s;up|ply <HI>Wallen&s;teyns</HI> Armie for two moneths together. Among o|ther victuals, there was 70000. pounds of bread; the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> brought with them 400. Bullockes, and 500.

<P>Before the King came to <HI>Fryenstadt,</HI> a certaine Major was &s;ent before (as it is the manner of warre) to &s;pie out the wayes and devices of the Enemy.
