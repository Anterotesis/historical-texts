<HEAD>Extract of &s;everall fre&s;h Letters written out of <HI>Germany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe cruelty u&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts at the taking of <HI>Mag|denburg</HI> (the like no Hi&s;tory hath nor could ever make mention of) had indeed troubled many Prote&s;tants in <HI>Ger|many,</HI> e&s;pecially the Elector of <HI>Saxen</HI> found him&s;elfe much perplexed upon the newes thereof, when he likewi&s;e was much troubled and urged by an Imperiall Amba&s;&s;adour and many other Me&s;&s;engers and letters, both from the Emperour and other Catholike Electors and Princes. How&s;oever &s;eeing by the example of <HI>Magdenburg</HI> what he and others of his Profe&s;sion and Religion have to looke for at their enemies hands and promi&s;es, and con&s;idering the Imperiall Mandates and Proclamations, publi&s;hed (like a thunder) again&s;t the con|clu&s;ion lately taken by him and other Prote&s;tant Princes and States a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Leip&s;ick;</HI> and hearing withall of the doubt and feare divers made of his con&s;tancie in the &s;aid re&s;olution, he both gave order for the greater &s;peed in the levying of his owne forces and &s;ent al&s;o &s;everall Me&s;&s;engers to other Prote|&s;tant Princes, States and Imperiall Cities, with ample letters, whereby he doth not onely a&s;&s;ure them of his con&s;tancie and proceeding in the performance of their re&s;olution, But ex|horteth them al&s;o, to make greater ha&s;te and to take more care than &s;ome of them did hitherto to prepare and defend them&s;elves, repre&s;enting the great nece&s;sity and danger, their enemies extraordinary arming, threatnings and executions would el&s;e bring them into.

<HEAD>The <HI>12.</HI> of <HI>Iune</HI> from the Army of his Excellence the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Whereas his Excell the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had pitcht Armie at the &s;ide of the River <HI>Ley</HI> before the Citie <HI>Bridges</HI> the 3 of moneth, each one thought that his Excellence was of intenti|on to approach &amp; be&s;iege the &s;aid Citie. But now it appeares probably that his Excel&punc; was not &s;o minded, for he did not en|trench him&s;elfe there, but lay with his Army in the field onely. In the meane while certaine Committees were &s;ent out of the &s;aid Citie in the name of the 4 parts of Flanders to treat with his Excelle~ce concerning the Contribution which was behind and had long time beene unpayd, in&s;omuch that they gave &s;e|curitie for entire payment of 10 yeares contribution. Where|upon his Excell with his whole Army departed, and the verie &s;ame night tooke his re&s;ting place at <HI>Maldegom,</HI> where we pa&s;|&s;ed the 5 of <HI>Iune</HI> over the river <HI>Lieve</HI> towards <HI>Walichem,</HI> and from thence toward <HI>Eckelo,</HI> and <HI>Caprick,</HI> and the 7 of &s;une re|turned backe with our whole armie at <HI>Watervliet,</HI> where his Excell. in&s;tantly cau&s;ed retrenchments to be ca&s;t up all along the <HI>Holland Dike,</HI> for the better en&s;uring of his armie, &s;o that in
<PB N="13" REF="8">ca&s;e the &s;pani&s;h forces (which as wee under&s;tood had continu|ally followed us) had come upon us, then had we taken the &s;aid Dike for our defence.</P>
<P>The 8 of <HI>Iune</HI> the provi&s;ion of his Excell. was embarqued, and his hor&s;e troopes, being commanded pre&s;ently as &s;oone as they &s;hould be landed to march toward <HI>Bergen op Zoome.</HI> Ye|&s;terday were all the Land-forces &s;hipt, and all the waggons put aboard. The firelockes in the meane time &s;tood in battle array, and held the watch untill all things were &s;afely embarqued. Thus with the whole traine of our armie wee marched from <HI>Y&s;endyck</HI> to <HI>Rammekens,</HI> &amp; &s;o downwards, &s;ayling many hun|dred &s;hippes together, &amp; &s;o for&s;ooke the <HI>Flemi&s;h coa&s;ts,</HI> which country in this our expedition wee have wholly brought un|der contribution untill the verie Citie <HI>Geudt.</HI> His Excellence in this expedition had a verie vigilant regard over his whole armie, and a &s;peciall care that all things might be carried verie orderly, in&s;omuch that hee cau&s;ed many of his &s;oldiers to bee hanged for their mi&s;demeanours and in&s;olencies committed again&s;t the inhabitants of the Countrie: But the like care was not taken on the other &s;ide, for many of our &s;oldiers which did &s;traggle &s;omewhat out of their limits had by them their No|&s;es and Eares cut off: Three &s;oldiers wives with a child of 8 yeares were taken by the Flemi&s;h and hanged.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day that we came to <HI>Watervliet,</HI> the &s;pani&s;h that night arrived at <HI>Caprick,</HI> but did not &s;hew them&s;elves any neerer unto us. So that in this enterprize, wee have not met with our enemie to any purpo&s;e, and have found no re&s;i&s;tance worthy of relation. Onely wee were informed that the ene|mie brought his whole armie together, therewith intending to cut off all pa&s;&s;ages from our armie and hinder the victualls from comming to us.
