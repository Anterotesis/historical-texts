<CELL ROLE="label"><HI>REASONS Offer'd by the New</HI> Ea&s;t-India Company, <HI>for Pa&s;&s;ing the Bill, for Rai&s;ing Two Millions, with the Benefit of the Trade to</HI> India, <HI>in the Year</HI> 1698.</CELL>
<CELL ROLE="label"><HI>And REASONS now Offer'd by the New</HI> Ea&s;t-India Company, <HI>against the Bill for Con|tinuing the Old</HI> Ea&s;t-India Company <HI>a Corpo|ration, in this pre&s;ent Year,</HI> 1699.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>1. THAT a Joint-Stock, Exclu&s;ive of all others, was a Monopily, infringing the Right of Trade, due to all Free-Born <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men.</CELL>
<CELL>1. BUT now They &s;ay, That to carry on the Trade, otherwi&s;e than in a Joynt-Stock, Exclu&s;ive of all others, is Impracticable, and will tend to the lo&s;ing the Trade to the Nation, and the de&s;tru|ction of our home Manufactures.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>2. That the <HI>Old Company</HI> were Beggars, and under &s;uch poor Circum|&s;tances, as not to be able to carry on the Trade: By which the Nation was di&s;honour'd, and the Trade in great danger of being lo&s;t.</CELL>
<CELL>2. But now They &s;ay, That the <HI>Old Company</HI> have Exported, &s;ince that time, Effects to above a Million; and have, and will bring in &s;uch quan|tities of <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, as will tend to ruine the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>3. That nothing under a Stock of Two Millions, was &s;ufficient to carry on the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade.</CELL>
<CELL>3. But now They &s;ay, That the 315000 <HI>l.</HI> Sub&s;cribed by the <HI>Old Com|pany,</HI> will carry on Yearly above half the Trade; By which, They who have Sub&s;cribed the Remainder of the Two Millions, will be deprived of the Benefit of the Trade, in proportion to their Sub&s;cription.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>4. That the Forts and Garri&s;ons were a perfect Lumber and Trum|pery, and ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s to the Trade; and that if They were in their hands, They would Demoli&s;h them.</CELL>
<CELL>4. But now they &s;ay, That the <HI>Old Company</HI> having the Benefit of the Forts and Ca&s;tles, are thereby in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Trade, and con&s;equently mu&s;t Ruine them, If the Bill for Continuing the <HI>Old Company</HI> a Corpora|tion, &s;hould Pa&s;s: By which, They do allow, the &s;aid Forts and Garri&s;ons to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>5 That their Debts in <HI>India</HI> were &s;o great, and their Credit &s;o intirely lo&s;t, That their pretended Stock was &s;o far from being of any Value, that it was 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> wor&s;e than nothing.</CELL>
<CELL>5. But now They &s;ay, That the <HI>Old Company</HI> have, by their Money and Credit, Purcha&s;ed &s;uch va&s;t Quantities of Goods in <HI>India,</HI> as to enhan&s;e the Price there, and lower them at home: And that by the Pa&s;&s;ing of this Bill, The <HI>Old Company</HI> will be put into a better Condition than the <HI>New,</HI> both Abroad and at Home.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>6. That the <HI>Old Company</HI> were &s;uch Beggars, Bankrupts and Knaves, They could never think of having any thing to do with them.</CELL>
<CELL>6. But now the <HI>New Company</HI> &s;ay, They have u&s;ed all their Endea|vours, and are ready, upon all Occa&s;ions, to &s;hew their Willingne&s;s to unite with the <HI>Old.</HI></CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>And further, The <HI>New Company</HI> have always alledged, That an <HI>East-India Company</HI> ought always to have a Capitol Stock of their own in hand, (without Borrowing, or making any Dividends out of the Principal Stock) &s;ufficient to carry on the Trade, for the Honour and Intere&s;t of the Nation.</P>
<P>But now it is well known, That the <HI>New Ea&s;t-India Company</HI> have been &s;o far from pur&s;uing this Rule, That They have not Traded with any Stock, but &s;uch as they have borrowed at Intere&s;t, and even divided 6 <HI>per Cent. per Annum</HI> out of &s;uch borrowed Money, before their Ships were &s;ent out.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Contradictions, with which They have Treated the <HI>Old Ea&s;t-India Company;</HI> And if they may pa&s;s for Rea&s;ons, to both their Purpo&s;es, The <HI>Old Ea&s;t-India Company</HI> are of all Men mo&s;t mi&s;erable.</P>
