<L>NOw will ye li&s;t a little &s;pace,</L>

<L>You to &s;olace, and be blyth,</L>
<L>Hearken, ye &s;hall hear belyve</L>
<L>A tale that is of veritie,</L>
<L>If ye will hearken unto me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>Naples</HI> lived there a King,</L>
<L>Had all the lands in Governing.</L>
<L>Who had a Lady fair and young,</L>
<L>Who&s;e name was called <HI>Lillian:</HI></L>
<L>This Lady plea&s;ant was and fair,</L>
<L>Bare him a Son, which was his Heir,</L>
<L>Who&s;e name was called <HI>Ro&s;wall:</HI></L>
<L>Of fairer heard I never tell;</L>
<L>Princes to him could not compare,</L>
<L><HI>Uli&s;&s;es</HI> nor <HI>Gandifere,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> nor <HI>Troyalus,</HI></L>
<L>Nor yet his Father <HI>Priamus:</HI></L>
<L>The Knight that kept the Parent well,</L>
<L>Was not &s;o fair as <HI>Ro&s;wall.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There lived into that Countrie,</L>
<L>Worthy noble Lords three,</L>
<L>That to the King had done trea&s;on,</L>
<PB REF="6">
<L>Therefore he put them in pri&s;on;</L>
<L>And there he held them many a day,</L>
<L>Till they were aged quite away,</L>
<L>Aged and quite o'regrown with hair,</L>
<L>While of their lives they did de&s;pair,</L>
<L>That they knew of no remedie,</L>
<L>But looked after death daily;</L>
<L>So it befell upon a day</L>
<L>The young Prince he went to play,</L>
<L>Him to play and to &s;olace,</L>
<L>And &s;o it happened in that ca&s;e,</L>
<L>Toward the Pri&s;on he is gone,</L>
<L>To hear thir Lords making their moan,</L>
<L>He &s;ate down and a little &s;taid,</L>
<L>To hearken what thir Lords &s;aid:</L>
<L>They &s;aid, dear God, have mind of us,</L>
<L>Even for the &s;ake of dear Ie&s;us,</L>
<L>Who bought us with his precious blood,</L>
<L>And for us dyed on the rood,</L>
<L>To help us, if thy will it be,</L>
<L>And of this Pri&s;on make us fr&eacute;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The young Prince did hear their moan,</L>
<L>He heard their mourning and their groan:</L>
<L>Then to his Chamber he is gone,</L>
<L>Heavy in heart, as &s;ad as &s;tone;</L>
<L>He &s;ate down and did fore&s;&eacute;e,</L>
<L>How be&s;t thir Lords might helped be,</L>
<L>And &s;o he thought upon a wyle,</L>
<L>The King how he might be&s;t beguile;</L>
<L>A cu&s;tome then had the Iaylors,</L>
<L>Who keeped ay the Pri&s;oners,</L>
<L>After the doors all locked were,</L>
<L>Vnto the King the keyes to bear,</L>
<L>The King u&s;ed them to lay</L>
<PB REF="6">
<L>Vnder his bed-head privily.</L>
<L>The Prince &s;oon perceiving had,</L>
<L>Where the King the keyes laid:</L>
<L>And on a night he watch did keep</L>
<L>Till that the King was fallen a&s;leep:</L>
<L>He took the keyes full privilie,</L>
<L>And to the Pri&s;on gone is he,</L>
<L>Who did deliver thir Lords thr&eacute;e,</L>
<L>Bade them pa&s;&s;e home to their Countrie:</L>
<L>And then they &s;wore by &s;weet Ie&s;us,</L>
<L>If ever ye mi&s;ter help of us,</L>
<L>We &s;hall you help into your n&eacute;ed:</L>
<L>Glad was he having done the d&eacute;ed.</L>
<L>The keyes laid under his Fathers head,</L>
<L>And went and &s;leept as he were dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King ro&s;e and eke the Queen,</L>
<L>The Principal, and Lords bedeen;</L>
<L>They went to me&s;&s;e and then to dine,</L>
<L>The Iaylors all did come in &s;yne,</L>
<L>Asked from the King the keyes,</L>
<L>Which to deliver did him plea&s;e:</L>
<L>Then to the Pri&s;on they went in fear,</L>
<L>To give the Lords their dinner there;</L>
<L>But when they came all were away,</L>
<L>They knew not what to do nor &s;ay.</L>
<L>The Pri&s;oners away were gone,</L>
<L>How, or what way known to none.</L>
<L>The King was then &s;o dollorous,</L>
<L>That the three Lords were &s;caped thus:</L>
<L>He &s;ayes, O Lord, how may this be,</L>
<L>That thir Pri&s;oners hath been made fr&eacute;e:</L>
<L>Vnder my bed-head lay the keyes,</L>
<L>None knew thereof, as God me ea&s;e.</L>
<PB REF="7">
<L>And here I make a &s;olemn vow,</L>
<L>Before you all my Lords now,</L>
<L>Who ere he be hath done the deed,</L>
<L>He &s;hall be hang'd without remeed:</L>
<L>Or el&s;e &s;o &s;oon as I him &s;ee,</L>
<L>My own two hands his bane &s;hall be:</L>
<L>It was reported through the Town,</L>
<L>That the young Prince the deed had done;</L>
<L>The word throughout the Pallace ran,</L>
<L>Which made the King a grieved man,</L>
<L>When he the vow con&s;idered,</L>
<L>And that his Son had done the d&eacute;ed.</L>
<L>The Queen then far more grieved was:</L>
<L>She mourn'd and w&eacute;eped with her face.</L>
<L>And quickly to the King went &s;he,</L>
<L>Who, kn&eacute;eling down upon her kn&eacute;e,</L>
<L>Thus &s;aid, for him that &s;its on hie,</L>
<L>Let your Sons fault forgiven be:</L>
<L>That may not be Madam, he &s;aid,</L>
<L>For I a faithfull vow have made,</L>
<L>That a&s;&s;oon as I may him &s;ee,</L>
<L>My own two hands his bane &s;hall be;</L>
<L>Therefore I pray you, day and night,</L>
<L>To keep him well out of my &s;ight,</L>
<L>Till I &s;end him to &s;ome Countrie,</L>
<L>Where he may &s;afely keeped be.</L>
<L>And then in ha&s;te down &s;ate the King,</L>
<L>Wrote letters without tarrying,</L>
<L>To &s;end his Son to the King of <HI>Bealm,</HI></L>
<L>For to remain in that Realm.</L>
<L>Still to continue with the King,</L>
<L>Till he &s;ent for his home-coming,</L>
<L>Letters in ha&s;te then &s;oon wrote he,</L>
<PB REF="7">
<L>De&s;iring the King e&s;peciallie,</L>
<L>For to receive his own dear Son,</L>
<L>Which for mo&s;t tru&s;t was &s;ent to him.</L>
<L>His furni&s;hing was made ready,</L>
<L>And he got gold in great plenty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Kings Steward, a &s;talward Knight,</L>
<L>Was made to keep him day and night,</L>
<L>And &s;o his &s;ervant for to be,</L>
<L>To keep him well in that Countrie:</L>
<L>The Queen did look to the Steward,</L>
<L>And &s;aid, my love, my joy, my heart,</L>
<L>Sir Steward, now I do th&eacute;e pray,</L>
<L>To keep my Son both night and day,</L>
<L>And &s;erve him both by foot and hand,</L>
<L>And thou &s;halt have both gold and land,</L>
<L>Or yet of any other thing</L>
<L>That thou'lt &s;eek from me or the King,</L>

<L>She &s;ayes, my fair Son <HI>Ro&s;wall,</HI></L>
<L>Hearken what I to thee will tell,</L>
<L>When thou do&s;t come to that Country,</L>
<L>Carry thy &s;elf right hone&s;tly,</L>
<L>Be Courteous, Genty, kind and fr&eacute;e,</L>
<L>And u&s;e ay in good companie:</L>
<L>And if thou neede&s;t ought to &s;pend,</L>
<L>Send word to me, I &s;hall thee &s;end.</L>
<L>He took his leave then of the Queen,</L>
<L>And of her Ladies all bedeen:</L>
<L>Great mourning and great care they made</L>
<L>When that out of the Town they rade,</L>
<L>The Gracious God mot be his guide.</L>
<L>So on a time as they did ride,</L>
<PB REF="8">
<L>Side for &s;ide, hand for hand rode they,</L>

<L>Only they two in companie,</L>
<L>Came to a River fair to &s;ee:</L>
<L>The Prince then &s;aid unto the Knight,</L>
<L>My coun&s;ell is that here we light:</L>
<L>For in this place I thir&s;t &s;o &s;ore,</L>
<L>That further can I ride no more,</L>
<L>Till of this water I get my fill:</L>
<L>Wot ye how I may win there till;</L>
<L>The Knight leapt down deliverlie,</L>
<L>And drank the water bu&s;ilie:</L>
<L>He bade him light and drink al&s;o</L>
<L>His fill ere he &s;hould further go:</L>
<L>And on his belly, as he lay down</L>
<L>To drink the water ready bown.</L>
<L>The fal&s;e Knight took him by the f&eacute;et,</L>
<L>And vow'd to throw him in the d&eacute;ep,</L>
<L>Vnle&s;&s;e that he did &s;wear an oath,</L>
<L>That he the Gold and letters both</L>
<L>Should unto him re&s;ign gladly,</L>
<L>And his &s;ervant become truly,</L>
<L>To &s;erve him well both day and night,</L>
<L>This oath he made to the fal&s;e Knight:</L>
<L>He the Ma&s;ter, and he the knave:</L>
<L>He gave to him what he would crave.</L>
<L>And then anone withoutten &s;tay,</L>
<L>They mounted both and went their way,</L>
<L>While they came to the Land of <HI>Bealm,</HI></L>
<L>And had pa&s;t much of that Realm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Kings Pallace when they came near</L>
<L><HI>Ro&s;wall</HI> made &s;orry chear:</L>

<L>Further with him for to ride;</L>
<L>He would fee &s;ervants in the Town,</L>
<L>Abundance of all fa&s;hion.</L>
<L>Away he rode then with his gold,</L>
<L>Leaving poor <HI>Ro&s;wall</HI> on the mold,</L>
<L>With not a penny in's companie</L>
<L>To buy his dinner, though he &s;hould die.</L>
<L>So to the Town in by he rode,</L>
<L>And in the Kings Pallace abode.</L>
<L>In his heart was great rejoycing,</L>
<L>Pre&s;ented his letters to the King;</L>
<L>He read his letters ha&s;tily,</L>
<L>And &s;aid, Sir, welcome mot ye be;</L>
