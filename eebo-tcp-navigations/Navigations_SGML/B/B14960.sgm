<P>_THe Lord <HI>Paul Stra&s;burg,</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador from the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania,</HI> ye&s;terday arrived here. The &s;aid Emba&s;&s;ador did refu&s;e to be received pub|likely with pomp and &s;tate, after the com|mon cu&s;tome and manner of entertaining of &s;uch per&s;ons. The rea&s;on was, becau&s;e he had left a great number of his followers in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e that the end of his comming into the&s;e parts, was concerning the Prince&s;&s;e; who is &s;i&s;ter to the King of <HI>Swe|dens</HI> Queene, and <HI>Bethlem Gabors</HI> widow. And furthermore, to conde&s;cend to the reque&s;t and de&s;ire of the Prince of <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania.</HI></P>
<P>The boi&s;terous humors of the military &s;ort, and e&s;pecially the <HI>Spahies;</HI> cannot as yet be pacified, nor the differences al|layd. They commit many in&s;olencies, without any re&s;pect to Magi&s;trates, &s;uperiors, or great ones Nay not &s;o much as bearing re&s;pect to the great <HI>Turke</HI> him&s;elfe, much le&s;&s;e to the <HI>&V;i&s;iers.</HI> Their in&s;olent pride is come to that height, that there is no other hope left but onely the ruine of the whole Turki&s;h Empire, or at lea&s;twi&s;e of their per&s;ons. The <HI>A&s;trologians</HI> haue progno&s;ticated a terrible bloud-&s;hedding in this Citie, and all matters indeede doe &s;eeme to di&s;po&s;e them&s;elues and bend to &s;uch a woefull effect. I doe palpably perceiue that our State is farre more dangerous, than the &s;ame was even at the depo|&s;ing &amp; killing of <HI>Sultan O&s;man.</HI> The Emperor or great Turke and all his Mini&s;ters and Councell, are without councell and
<PB N="3" REF="2"> at their wits end. Ye&s;terday the <HI>Zebe&s;ies</HI> (tho&s;e are they that governe and keepe the Munition and Ordnance) did ma&s;&s;acre publikely one of their <HI>Surva&s;ies</HI> or Captaines: and which is mo&s;t &s;trange, even at that time when the Turkes doe keepe their <HI>Ramedan,</HI> or fa&s;ting moneth; at which time they doe v|&s;ually abhorre and ab&s;taine from all manner of wicked in&s;o|lencies, e&s;pecially from bloud-&s;hedding. It is to be feared, that after their <HI>Bairam,</HI> a fearefull bloudy tragedie will fol|low.

<HEAD>From <HI>Dantzich</HI> the <HI>4.</HI> of May, <HI>1632.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>Polonia</HI> haue &s;o long di&s;puted of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their King, that at the la&s;t they haue found a rea&s;on of re&s;ol|ving the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by his death. The &s;aid Kings death befell at <HI>War&s;aw</HI> on the 29th day of <HI>Aprill</HI> la&s;t, he dyed of an Apo|plexie, which indeede he was &s;trucke withall &s;ixe dayes be|fore. His death fell out very vn&s;ea&s;onably: for <HI>Polonia</HI> being now envelopped &amp; fallen into warres with <HI>Mu&s;covia,</HI> which certainly will cau&s;e the States of that Kingdome to ha&s;ten the choice of a new King; which election is deferred vntill the &s;econd Sunday after Whit&s;untyde. In the meane while the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Gue&s;nen</HI> governes the whole Kingdome for the time being. Among the chiefe&s;t Competitors for this Crowne, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is by all men &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t likely: next to him the Prince <HI>&V;lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;laus,</HI> elde&s;t &s;onne to the late decea&s;ed King; then the Prince <HI>Ca&s;imirus</HI> hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> bro|ther by the Fathers &s;ide, and the Arch-duke <HI>Leopoldus.</HI> But be|cau&s;e the la&s;t of the&s;e is not e&s;teemed fortunate and &s;ucce&s;&s;e|full in his de&s;ignes of Warre, the Election is rather a&s;cribed to the &s;trength &amp; power of the fir&s;t, or favour of the &s;econd. The rather becau&s;e their States haue recalled him from the great charge which was laid vpon him, being Generall of the Armie again&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> as &s;oone as ever they percei|ved his Father drawing to an end, they having e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;ent into his roome, the Prince <HI>Razevill.</HI></P>

<P>Wee doe heare that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> receiues but &s;mall
<PB N="4" REF="3"> content at <HI>Barcelone.</HI> They are a very head-&s;trong people, very hardly to be per&s;waded. The Deputies haue alreadie had &s;ome bickering with Count <HI>Olivarez,</HI> who being entred into di&s;cour&s;e with them vpon &s;ome matter belonging to the Voyage; they perceiving that he &s;pake of moneyes, an&s;wered him, that they would account with the King him&s;elfe, and not with him.</P>
<P>The Infant <HI>Carles</HI> hath taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the charge of Generali&s;&s;imo of the Seas, which was provided for him &s;ixe moneths agoe. The Ceremony was, that he went to Sea &s;ome ten leagues, with &s;ome Gallyes and Gallions, and then came backe and made his entry into <HI>Barcelonia,</HI> in &s;tate and qualitie of Generali&s;&s;imo. Vnto this great Charge was that given al&s;o vnto him, of being Vicar Generall of the King, which great place doth &s;ubject vnto him, all the Viceroyes and Governors of that Countrey.</P>
<P>Lately there was almo&s;t rai&s;ed a great tumult at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> be|twixt the Souldiers of the Garri&s;on and the Inhabitants of that Citie. Which trouble&s;ome Difference, <HI>Don Fredericke de Toledo</HI> could no otherwi&s;e appea&s;e, but by the impri&s;oning of &s;ome of the Souldiers. Although the hurt and wrong done, was not very great. But the in&s;olencies of tho&s;e people will encrea&s;e, if they be not timely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. It is &s;aid that here the Deputies are accorded and agreed to yeeld vnto the King two millions and an halfe; in ca&s;e and on condition, that he will be plea&s;ed to recall the new impo&s;ition vpon Salt. But the King before he will conde&s;cend vnto that, he will pre&s;&s;e them to maintaine 30000. foote, and 6000. hor&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> the <HI>12.</HI> of Iune.</HEAD>
<P>I promi&s;ed you at your la&s;t departure to giue you notice of the particular pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e parts; which I will now accordingly performe, beginning from the day that the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> invanded this Land. Vpon Wedne&s;day being the &s;econd of <HI>Iune,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came into that part of <HI>Gilderland,</HI> which was &s;ubject to the King of <HI>Spaine:</HI> and dividing his Armie, laid &s;iege both vnto <HI>&V;enlo</HI> and <HI>Rure|mond:</HI> and becau&s;e he might the ea&s;ier winne the people to
<PB N="5" REF="3"> yeeld vp tho&s;e Townes without effu&s;ion of blood; he &s;ent vn|to them conditions of peace, con&s;i&s;ting of 18. Articles, which were &s;o ea&s;ie and favourable in their behalfes, as their owne hearts could de&s;ire. Among&s;t which Articles one was; That they &s;hould enjoy free exerci&s;e of Religion, without any di|minution of &s;uch rents, as appertained to the Clergie; or mo|le&s;tation of tho&s;e Religious Orders which were within tho&s;e Townes. The Citizens having thoroughly con&s;idered vpon the&s;e points, and finding the number of their Souldiers not &s;ufficient to with&s;tand any violent a&s;&s;ault; thought be&s;t to accept of them.</P>
<P>Wherevpon, tho&s;e of <HI>Venlo</HI> delivered vp their Towne vnto the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> vpon Friday <HI>Iune</HI> 4. and tho&s;e of <HI>Rure|mond,</HI> the Sunday following. It is &s;aid, that at the celebration of the Sacrament, the Prince gaue order vpon paine of death, that the Souldiers &s;hould not mole&s;t nor deride the <HI>Catholiks</HI> in the time of their publike Proce&s;&s;ion. This is a thing which gaue the people no &s;mall contentment: and which will not a little advance the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in their after conque&s;ts, if they continue firme in this re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Wee haue newes, that Graue <HI>Erne&s;t</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> was &s;laine before <HI>Ruremond</HI> with a Musket-&s;hot, as he was alighting off his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> having placed &s;trong Guards in the afore&s;aid Townes; continued on his march forwards, &amp; hath &s;ince taken in a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, with two other wall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d Townes and (as it is reported) is now come before <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> where Graue <HI>Iohn de Na&s;&s;au</HI> is readie to entertaine them with Canon-&s;hot, having lodged the la&s;t weeke 4000. men within the Towne, for the better &s;ecuring of the place.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Forces are ha&s;ting out of the <HI>Pa|latinate,</HI> and that the people of <HI>Leige</HI> doe refu&s;e their pa&s;&s;age thorough their Countrey, becau&s;e of certaine wrongs they haue lately received by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> As for Graue <HI>Henrie Vanden Berg,</HI> he hath retired him&s;elfe vnto the Citie of <HI>Leige</HI> &s;ince the lo&s;&s;e of his government; for all the Dutchie of <HI>Gel|derland</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4"> is now conquered by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> the Towne of <HI>Gelders</HI> onely excepted.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were thus in acting, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (who for more &s;urety fi&s;hed with two hookes) put in exe|cution an other enterpri&s;e of no le&s;&s;e important con&s;iderati|on. For vpon Munday la&s;t (being the &s;eventh of this moneth) they came vp the River of <HI>Antwerp</HI> with a great Fleete of &s;hips, boates, and pontous, and disbarking their men about t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the clocke in the night, not farre from a Fort called in <HI>Dutch, Creutz-Sconce,</HI> or <HI>Cro&s;&s;e Sconce;</HI> before it was mor|ning they had &s;o well intrenched them&s;elues, that &s;o &s;oone that the day appeared, they mounted their Canon, and be|gan to batter the Fort; continuing the batterie all the day fol|lowing, (in which time they made two violent a&s;&s;aults, though both times repul&s;ed) and vpon Wedne&s;day, the Souldiers of the Fort (finding no &s;uccour comming, and their Captaine being &s;laine) delivered it to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> by ac|cord, who now are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Some two houres after the deliverie of this place, <HI>Don C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r|los de Coloma</HI> (having no notice thereof) marched out of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> with &s;ome &s;ix thou&s;and men of foote, and certaine Troupes of hor&s;e, with eight Canon to &s;uccour it: but finding at his approach that the Fort was taken, hee be&s;towed &s;ome &s;hot of Artillerie again&s;t it, and after hee had skirmi&s;hed a while with the Enemy, &s;eeing no hope (as then) to di&s;lodge them, he made his retreat, giving order to the Cavallery to march over the water into <HI>Flaunders.</HI></P>
<P>Thus haue you heard what hath pa&s;&s;ed in this Countrey within the &s;pace of eight dayes, all the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters haue befal|len this Land through want of Souldiers to defend it. There was about &s;ome two moneths &s;ince a goodly Armie, ready at a dayes warning, to march into the field, but it was di&s;per&s;ed, part being &s;ent to the reconque&s;t of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> others to the &s;uccour of the Emperor, and a third part into <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in <HI>Mon&s;ieurs</HI> (the <HI>French</HI> Kings Brother) behalfe. All I can adde to this former di&s;cour&s;e is, that there is a generall feare
<PB N="7" REF="4"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the hearts of the Inhabitants, as if they were al|ready in the Enemies clutches.</P>
<P>We doe heare that &s;ome two dayes &s;ince the Cardinall <HI>de Cueua</HI> ranne hazard to be &s;laine, as he was getting into his Coach, by a drunken <HI>Burger,</HI> who a&s;&s;aulted and reviled him.</P>

The next morning ad|vi&s;e being brought that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army did lodge but two leagues from thence at a market Towne called <HI>Gelheym,</HI> they would by no means neglect that occa&s;ion, but pre&s;ently re&s;ol|ued to march directly thither, &amp; to a&s;&s;ault the enemy.

And that which vex|eth me yet more is, that this mi&s;chiefe is occa&s;ioned even from tho&s;e who are obliged unto me, for many con&s;iderati|ons, to contribute by all meanes po&s;&s;ible, unto my content|ons, to contribute by all meanes po&s;&s;ible, unto my content|ment, and the good of my E&s;tate.</P>
<P>There is no man ignorant of the faire and loving carriage which I have &s;hewed unto my Brother the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> and his followers, and that knowes not likewi&s;e, how ill they have requited it, and the ill de&s;ignes which my &s;ayd Brother by theyr pernicious advice, hath made appeare the&s;e la&s;t five or &s;ixe yeares upon all occa&s;ions; and then when he hath &s;eene me imployed in affaires, as important as nece&s;&s;ary, as well within as without my Kingdome. Again&s;t which, being de&s;irous to provide by tho&s;e cour&s;es that are mo&s;t fit to impeach them, I thought I had the la&s;t yeare taken from him one of the mo&s;t powerfull meanes of troubling the &s;tate, in &s;eparating from his intere&s;t, the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> who di|vers times before, had furthered his departure out of my Kingdome: at which time I did &s;hew an extraordinary fa|vour
<PB N="12" REF="8"> to the &s;aid Duke, in contenting my &s;elfe with his faith|full promi&s;es, and the con&s;ignement of one of his places. Whereas, being as I was in his Country, and having there a powerfull Army, I could then have ea&s;ily deprived him of all the places he had, &s;eeing that then he wanted forces to defend them, and this I was not onely unwilling to doe my &s;elfe, but I can boldly affirme, that I hindred others that had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n the power and will to have done it.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this favour having under&s;tood that the &s;ayd Duke in&s;tead of a religious performance of his faith and word (whereto I had &s;ufficiently obliged him) continued his fir&s;t Intelligences, I have omitted no cour&s;e within my power that might divert him from them, but have beene &s;o farre from gayning ought thereby; but on the contrary, the &s;ayd Duke not content to hold on his former practi&s;es again&s;t my E&s;tate, but hath &s;ollicited and incouraged all tho&s;e, whom he held capable of his ill re&s;olutions, even to the &s;ending of di|vers Me&s;&s;ages unto the Emperour, for the altering of his good intentions, and &s;oliciting the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to furni&s;h my Brother, to bandy again&s;t me, who am his King and Sove|raigne, as he him&s;elfe meant to have done on his part.</P>
<P>To this effect, he hath increa&s;ed the number of his &s;ouldi|ers, and made divers extraordinary levyes, &s;educing even tho&s;e of mine owne Army without giving me any &s;atisfacti|on for the &s;ame. And the better to attaine his ends, he hath fortified and furni&s;hed his Places, without any other cau&s;e, than the ill will he hath borne unto this E&s;tate. And moreo|ouer, hath redoubled his cunning plots and practi&s;es, I avow that I could hardly have beleeved, that the Duke had borne me &s;o much ill will, had not divers Letters written by his Father and Si&s;ter alighted into my hands, which Letters not onely import, that he was ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t my Brother with his Armes, but moreover invited him &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider how he may gaine my Crowne which they &s;ay in expre&s;&s;e termes cannot chu&s;e but quickly fall into his hands.</P>
<P>The which being joyned with divers other particular In|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lligences, which I have; among others; &s;ome which I
<PB N="13" REF="8"> have gotten out of divers Letters written by the Lord <HI>Pay-Laurens,</HI> unto the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Pfaltsburg,</HI> wherby he doth a&s;&s;ure her of certaine de&s;&s;ignes of very great importance, which he &s;ayes will prove infallable. I could doe no le&s;&s;e than &s;et my &s;elfe in a cour&s;e of defence again&s;t &s;o much ill will whereof to my great griefe, I am mo&s;t certainly informed.</P>
<P>I did beleeve, that having provided for the &s;afety of &s;ome places where mine enemies might have layd theyr founda|tion (as you have under&s;tood by my former Letters) and that I being &s;o powerfully armed, and con&s;equently in &s;uch a State, as they might very well judge that all their enterpri&s;es would not po&s;&s;ibly take effect; they would have left theyr ill affectioned intentions, and particularly above the re&s;t, the &s;ayd Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> unto whom I did m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ke knowne, that my forces were in <HI>Germany,</HI> to prevent the ruine of the <HI>Ele|ctor</HI> of <HI>Triers,</HI> and to protect the Catholike Religion and E|lectors Catholike, as indeed I would have done the yeare before, had not the&s;e wicked devices and evill practices hin|dred and prevented me. But when I &s;ee my &s;elfe thus quite fru&s;trated of all my hopes, and &s;eeing that it is &s;o farre un|likely that I am able to divert the &s;ayd Duke from all his un|ju&s;t de&s;ignes, that to the contrary (which was a maine meanes to draw me from that good intention which I had to prevent the ruine of mine Allye, the &s;ayd Elector, and &s;o likewi&s;e the ruine of all other <HI>Catholike</HI> Electors, by the &s;ame way which I had propo&s;ed for the former) to the breach of the Treaty of <HI>Vic.</HI> w^c^h did oblige him to have no corre&s;pondencie with my Brother, he did entice him to come with armes &amp; forces into my Dominions, where he was no &s;ooner entred, but he began to make open warre and ho&s;tility, cutting in peeces and de|feating a whole Company of <HI>Carabins,</HI> which the Mar&s;hall <HI>Deffiat</HI> cau&s;ed to pa&s;&s;e thorough without any &s;u&s;picion; not|with&s;tanding the &s;ayd Duke was obliged to yeeld free pa&s;|&s;age to my troupes and forces. Whence you &s;ee it followed, that my Brother entred with a &s;trong armed hand into my Kingdome.</P>
<P>All the&s;e rea&s;ons afore mentioned, have con&s;trained me to
<PB N="14" REF="9"> fall into his Dominions and jurisdiction, to make him &s;en&s;i|ble of my indignation, and feele the puni&s;hment of his wicked infidelity, and to &s;upport the welfare of my Realme and by the&s;e troubles of his Dominions, to pre&s;ent the euill intended again&s;t mine.</P>
<P>I haue beene very willing to acquaint you with all the a|fore&s;ayd pa&s;&s;ages, to the end that you might make all my loving and faithfull Subjects of <HI>France;</HI> within the bounds and limits of your charge, partakers thereof.

Iu&s;t, in as much as this warre of mine is cau&s;ed not onely by a Prince who hath neglected no meanes for the troubling of State, with the breach of his faith and word; but moreover a Prince who being my Va&s;&s;all, by rea&s;on of &s;ome part of his e&s;tate, hath voluntarily plunged him&s;elfe into a notorious Fe|lony.
