<HEAD>A RELATION OF THE LATE INTENDED Horrible Trea&s;on again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>whole &s;tate of the Vnited Provinces, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe la&s;t weeke we receiued and publi&s;hed certaine pri|uate Letters concerning the late intended horrible trea&s;on again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> of the Low Countries; At what time the &s;aid Letters were written, little or no|thing was knowne concerning the &s;aid Con&s;piracie, but &s;ince divers per&s;ons haue beene apprehended, and &s;ome of them examined, and tortured; vpon who&s;e examination the <HI>States</HI> haue permitted &s;ome|thing to be publi&s;hed to the world thereof, which I hauing receiued in the Printed Dutch Copie, I haue cau&s;ed to be tran&s;lated and Printed together with
<PB REF="3">the originall; vnto which I haue added the weekely Relation of Newes from &s;everall parts of the world; a&s;&s;uring you, that &s;o &s;oone as more particulars &s;hall come to my hand, by the like &s;ure hand with good approbation you &s;hall receiue it impartially, till when I bid you farewell, this 19. of February, 1622.</P>
<P>CErtaine dayes agoe, came certaine men to &s;ome &s;ailers of the Barge or &s;mall Ship of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &amp;c., telling that they were Ingeners, and good Parriots, and relating that they had in hand certaine enterpri&s;es again&s;t the enemies, in which they were to be imployed &s;ecretly, and mu&s;t cau&s;e certaine fire-works of Gun-powder and other mat|terialls to be made readie, without reuealinge to any liuing bodie. For if they did otherwi&s;e and that it came to the light they &s;hould &s;uffer puni&s;hment on their bodie, in regard of the&s;e and other &s;peeches did the Sailers promi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and to keepe coun&s;ell for the good of the Country.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wolues in &s;heepes skinnes hoping that they &s;hould come to their intent, or purpo&s;e, one of the Traytors (as you &s;hall heare hereafter) went to his pocket, and gaue each of the Sailers afore&s;aid three hundred Gilders (which amount to thirtie poundes &s;terling) to encourage them the better to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and told them if they made their workes well, and that they made good operations that they &s;hould be better rewarded. But they ad|moni&s;hed them againe to keepe &s;ecrecie aboue all thinges, &s;eeing (as they &s;ayd) it concerned mightily
<PB N="3" REF="3">the Countrey, and charged them to bring the fire-workes afore&s;ayd as &s;oone as they &s;hould be done, in Trunkes and Che&s;tes, to the <HI>Hage</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> from whence they &s;hould carry them, where it &s;hould be required, and they be ordered to tran&s;port them, a&s;&s;uring them to performe their promi&s;e, within the &s;pace of a certaine time.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Traitors played afterward the Mer|chant and bought certaine <HI>Pistols</HI> to &s;end them (as he told) to <HI>Count-Mansfield,</HI> and others; The&s;e be|ing packt vp in a Truncke and &s;ent by his direction to the hou&s;e of one of his con&s;orts, who had a deepe Seller into which they were pre&s;ently carryed, and tryed again&s;t a heape of &s;and whether they wold giue fire, &amp; were fit for their purpo&s;e. Afterwards he cau|&s;ed them to be packt into another Truncke, and to be &s;ent to an Inne of the <HI>Hage,</HI> as it appeared lately.</P>
<P>About this time were the Con&s;pirators and their con&s;orts appointed to meete on &s;euerall places, where they intended to execute their wicked de|&s;ignes. And among&s;t the re&s;t, the&s;e Saylers afore&s;aid, came the 5. of <HI>February</HI> with &s;ome of their fire-works to the Inne appointed vnto them in the <HI>Hage,</HI> where they found diuers other men be&s;ides them which had &s;et them on worke, vpon the deliuery of it the Saylers were very well entertained with drinke, and meate without any charge of their owne.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Saylers perceiuing with an eye ca&s;t, that the partie who gaue him the mony, had &s;ome conference with a man of <HI>Bley&s;wick</HI> as he &s;u&s;pected, and tooke him, for &s;uch one, (as he was certaine off) to be no friend or well willer of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4">This Sayler mu&s;ing about this, went to bed with one of his louing fellowes, and although he had well &s;up|ped, neuerthele&s;&s;e was his head full of &s;trange con|ceits, his fellow &s;lept the &s;ame night very well, but he dreamed many &s;euerall dreames, and when he a|waked he had many &s;trange fancies in his minde, &s;o that this night &s;eemed very long vnto him, &amp; wi&s;hed many times for the day light.</P>
<P>As &s;oone as it was day light they ro&s;e with their other fellowes and laught about the dreaming, falling tumbling and to&s;&s;ing of the dreamer a|fore&s;ayd, but he would not tell them what his minde did giue him and how he was affected. After that they two had ta&s;ted a Cup of <HI>Aqua uitae</HI> they went to|gether walking abroad, the re&s;t remaining yet by their drinke.</P>
<P>As &s;oone as the Dreamer came on the &s;treet hee told to his fellow his late dreames, and what he had &s;eene and ob&s;erued, the day before, and &s;ayd in plaine termes vnto him, that he &s;u&s;pected the&s;e counter|feicted Ingeners were plotting Trea&s;on, relating al&s;o that he thought it very co~uenient, to giue the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> notice of their &s;etting at worke and pro|ceedings and other circum&s;tances, for (&s;ayd he) if this be a thing which is for the good of the Country, without que&s;tion the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;hall know of it.</P>
<P>The other interpo&s;ing pre&s;ently his Iudgement &s;pake in this manner, It cannot hinder vs although we giue the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> notice of this, for if the matter be indeed intended for the good of the Countrey, we haue done it, and receiued therefore
<PB N="5" REF="4">three hundred Gilders, And if it be otherwi&s;e the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will moreouer without doubt ho|nour vs with a peece of money, or &s;ome drinke mo|ney as they &s;ayd, and we &s;hall &s;tand &s;till in his fauour. To be briefe they concluded among&s;t them&s;elues to reueale it to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but feared that they &s;hould not be able and re&s;olute enough to &s;peake to his Excellency. But con&s;idering by them|&s;elues that it was a matter of great con&s;equence, they went towards the Court, intending to try their for|tune how&s;oeuer. When they came there, they per|ceiued that his Excelency was rod abroad towards <HI>Ri&s;ewick,</HI> (where is one of his Stables of hor&s;es) whereupon they went in all ha&s;t thitherwards, and di&s;cour&s;ing by the way, made one another to beleeue firmely that it was but a foule bu&s;ines which they had taken in hand. As &s;oone as they arriued at <HI>Ri&s;ewick,</HI> they found out one of the Pages of his Excellency and intreated him, to giue notice to the Prince his Ma|&s;ter, that they would faine &s;peake with him: Here|upon hee &s;ent them word that hee was pre&s;ently to take his Coach, and would come to heare them, Whereouer they de&s;ired the Page againe, to &s;hew his Excellency that they would willingly &s;peake with him in&s;tantly, euen about a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e which concer|ned him&s;elfe mightily.</P>
<P>The Prince hauing vnder&s;tood this, commanded his Page to bring the&s;e Saylers afore&s;ayd vnto him, and when they &s;tood before him, he asked them what their de&s;ire was, they an&s;wered, that they had &s;ome &s;ecret matters to impart with his Excellency. Whereupon he tooke them a&s;ide, and conferred pri|uately
<PB N="6" REF="5">with them, and hearing of a thing of which he knew not before, he mu&s;ed not vpon the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, but road in all ha&s;t to the <HI>Hage,</HI> and reuealed this matter at the meeting, or Coun&s;ell Chamber of the States: Whereupon there was giuen order that the 6. of <HI>February,</HI> (according to the new &s;tile) in the yeare 1623. (as they reckon already, beginning their new yeare continually with the fir&s;t day of <HI>Ia|nuary</HI>) the <HI>Fi&s;call,</HI> or <HI>Prouo&s;t,</HI> or rather the <HI>Attourney</HI> of the Court was &s;ent with certaine men, which at|tended vpon him, to &s;earch the Inne or Tauerne (&s;eeing the Dutch word <HI>Herberge</HI> which in this place is v&s;ed, &s;ignifieth both) of the <HI>Helmet</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;ket</HI> in the &s;treet called the North-end.</P>
<P>Comming there he asked the Ho&s;te for the Truncks and the owners thereof, two of them which are named in the Proclamation hearing an inckling of this, &s;tole &s;ecretly at the &s;ame in&s;tant out of the &s;ayd hou&s;e, comming away betwixt the Sergants and men which attended vpon the <HI>Fi&s;call.</HI> All the the other were &s;tayed or arre&s;ted in the hou&s;e vn|till the <HI>Fi&s;call</HI> &s;hould come backe againe out of the meeting of the States, where he told that this was not the hou&s;e, for the Ho&s;te was much di&s;contented, and &s;ayd that he had no Trunkes of any lodgers or &s;trangers in his hou&s;e, But being afterwards infor|med and per&s;waded to the contrary, he went to the &s;ayd hou&s;e againe, and &s;earcht vntill hee found the Truncks, and cea&s;ed vpon the Ho&s;te his Mayden-&s;eruant be&s;ide three other men, among&s;t which was he who gaue the money to the foure Saylers, which being euen with the re&s;t taken, were kept in a
<PB REF="5">Chamber at the <HI>Fi&s;calls</HI> hou&s;e, vntill &s;uch time as the other had partly confe&s;&s;ed the matter.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;te and the other for all that they were mightily threatned, and &s;trictly examined, would confe&s;&s;e nothing which had any likelihood or colour of truth. Whereupon there was pre&s;ently or|dered that the Souldiers which lay there in Garri&s;on &s;hould in&s;tantly be&s;et and &s;top all the pa&s;&s;ages to wards the <HI>Hage.</HI></P>
<P>This was not &s;ooner performed, ere there came one of the Traytors afore&s;ayd, in a Waggon which he had hyred to carry him to <HI>Delfe.</HI> The Souldiers perceiuing this Waggon, asked who was there, Whereupon he (knowing his Guiltie con&s;cience) &s;prong or leaps from the Waggon intending to e|&s;cape by running away, whereby there aro&s;e a great rumor in the <HI>Hage,</HI> in &s;uch manner that euen the Towne&s;men armed them&s;elues.</P>
<P>In the meane time there was a Sergant &s;ent in all po&s;t ha&s;t towards <HI>Leyden</HI> to fetch the Hangman which put there the &s;ame day &s;ome Malefactors to the torture. So that vpon the fa&s;ting and prayer day (which was appointed by the States) after the Sermon in the Church was done, they were exami|ned by the hangman in an other manner, which made them to confe&s;&s;e &s;o much, that the <HI>Pi&s;call</HI> was pre&s;ently &s;ent to the dwelling place of the widowe and children of <HI>Barneuelt:</HI> comming there he learned that his Sonnes were departed, although they were yet the day before &s;eene walking in the &s;treets, where|vpon two of their &s;eruants, and the Pedagoge or Tu|tor of the children were apprehended, and the hou&s;e
<PB REF="6">left in the cu&s;todie of the Sergeants.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Malefactors had now readie enough confe&s;&s;ed concerning the &s;aid bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, the States commanded the Saylers to be &s;et in&s;tantly at liberty, and be&s;towed aboue 20. double Ryders of the Vni|ted Provinces (each one of them amounts to twen|tie-one &s;hillings Sterling) vpon euery one of them. Wherevpon they went away with good content|ment, and hoped according to the Tenor of the Proclamation, to get yet certaine thou&s;and Gil|ders.</P>
<P>On thur&s;day night, there were yet three other of their con&s;orts taken; and on Fryday one of <HI>Berc|kel,</HI> and two of S. <HI>Hertoghenbo&s;h.</HI> Their names I will yet keepe &s;ecret, to blame them not before they are found guiltie, and cannot cleare them|&s;elues.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Fryday it was rumored in the Court, that a Souldier had de&s;erved alreadie foure thou|&s;and Gilders, hauing taken one of them which are mentioned in the Proclamation.</P>
<P>Certaine Cittizens of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Delft,</HI> were taken the &s;ame Fryday, and the next Satter|day.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;ions of the accu&s;ed are kept verie &s;ecret by the States, and there is mightily doubted, whither the common people &s;hall be acquainted with them, even for great and weightie rea&s;ons, &s;ee|ing al&s;o the olde Proverbe &s;ayth, <HI>That he &s;hall &s;eldome doe euill, who knoweth it not.</HI> And there are &s;ome which are well informed of their trayterous de|&s;ignes, that will &s;ay, that there is no Chronicle nor
<PB REF="6">Hi&s;torie which maketh mention, of &s;uch a Bar|berous Enterpri&s;e, and relate moreouer that if it had &s;ucceeded, that the Pillars had beene fetcht from vnder out of the building, where|by the vtter ruine of it would haue followed im|mediately: That a great number of the Inhabi|tantes &s;hould haue beene murdered, and blowne vp in the ayre be&s;ides them which &s;hould haue beene burnt, and &s;layne by the &s;word of our Enemies, which lay ready with many thou&s;andes liering af|ter this occa&s;ion and pray, which is for this time by the fauour and mercy of the Almightie fetcht as if it were out of their Iawes, he hauing heard the prayers of the faithfull. For it is mo&s;t con&s;tantly reported that the murther of the Principall heades, and members of the&s;e Prouinces, be&s;ides the firing of the <HI>Magazins</HI> or &s;tore hou&s;es with powder, were intended vpon the late mentioned fa&s;ting day.</P>
<P>Here commeth daylie newes, and we perceiue it al&s;o, that diuers wicked per&s;ons of their con&s;ort begin to ab&s;ent them&s;elues, a&s;well hence, as from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Leyden,</HI> be&s;ides other places.</P>
<P>As &s;oone as they bring here any one to the Pri&s;on, the people runnes together in &s;uch manner as if they were going to an a&s;&s;ault.</P>

And then with great griefe of heart I re&s;olued to make it knowne: be&s;ee|ching all faithfull and hone&s;t hearted Chri&s;tians, both night and day to call vpon the Lord God by prayer, and earne&s;tly be&s;eech the Lord God, that hee will be gratiou&s;ly plea&s;ed to turne from vs all the&s;e plagues, euen according to his owne Diuine and godly will.</P>
