<HEAD>AN ELEGY On that Famous SEA-COMMANDER Michael De Ruyter, Lieutenant Admiral of the United Netherlands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> VVho lately Died of his Wounds, Received in the Engagement between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Fleets near <HI>SICILY.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Prai&s;e is a Tribute each true Poet owes,</L>
<L>To <HI>Worth</HI> and <HI>Valour</HI> where&s;o'ere it grows.</L>
<L><HI>Mountains</HI> and <HI>Seas</HI> may bound the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Kings,</HI></L>
<L>But our <HI>Free Mu&s;e,</HI> with unconfined wings</L>
<L>Flies over both, tho&s;e that Allegiance yield</L>
<L>To different States, are all her Subjects &s;til'd.</L>
<L>And though a Soul breaths not within our I&s;le,</L>
<L>That can more dearly Love its Native &s;oil.</L>
<L>Yet when I look abroad, where'ere <HI>I Ken,</HI></L>
<L>The Good and Brave, they are my <HI>Countrymen.</HI></L>
<L>And &s;hall <HI>De Ruyter</HI> Limp into a Grave</L>
<L>Without a <HI>Mourning Ver&s;e?</HI> No <HI>Poem</HI> have</L>
<L>T'Embalm his <HI>Fame,</HI> and let next Ages know,</L>
<L>How much they to his <HI>Great Example</HI> owe?</L>
<L>'Twere <HI>Moral Sacriledge,</HI> Nor can it be,</L>
<L>His generous Acts command an Elegy;</L>
<L>Say but <HI>De Ruyter</HI>'s Dead, The news transforms</L>
<L>Neptunes calm Face into a thou&s;and Storms:</L>
<L>The &s;ighing <HI>Winds</HI> his rigid Fate deplore,</L>
<L>And murmur his <HI>Lon'd Name</HI> to every &s;hore,</L>
<L>which &s;oon as heard, <HI>Seamen</HI> (though Enemies)</L>
<L>Cannot re&s;train the Torrents of their Eyes;</L>
<L>Even tho&s;e that never wept before, &s;trike Sail</L>
<L>To grief, and now the mighty Lo&s;s bewail;</L>
<L>His <HI>Lo&s;s!</HI> who&s;e <HI>able Parts</HI> had many a year,</L>
<L>Been the <HI>Be&s;t Card</HI> by which <HI>Sailers</HI> could <HI>Steer;</HI></L>
<L>VVho &s;olely by his <HI>ample Merits</HI> call,</L>
<L>Attain'd the Honour of an <HI>Admiral.</HI></L>
<L>VVho had &s;o often <HI>Thetis</HI> bo&s;om lain,</L>
<L>So long been us'd to Trace the <HI>Pathle&s;s Main;</HI></L>
<L>That <HI>Sea-nymphs welcom'd</HI> him where ere he came,</L>
<L>And every <HI>Dolphin</HI> knew him by his Name;</L>
<L>His <HI>Services</HI> were numerou&s;ly <HI>Great,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Second Atlas</HI> of a mighty <HI>State;</HI></L>
<L>Prudent in <HI>Councels,</HI> and yet bold in <HI>War,</HI></L>
<L>To meet tho&s;e dangers he <HI>fore &s;aw</HI> a far:</L>
<L><HI>A well-poiz'd Valour,</HI> that would never &s;hrink,</L>
<L>Neither beholden unto <HI>Oaths</HI> nor <HI>Drink;</HI></L>
<L>who in the height of <HI>Fight,</HI> and depth of <HI>&s;laughter</HI></L>
<L>(when all the world &s;eem'd only <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Water:</HI></L>
<L>And with a horrid Pro&s;pect gaping lay,</L>
<L>As if the <HI>Deluge,</HI> and the <HI>Latter day</HI></L>
<L>Had met, and mingled Forces to devour</L>
<L>The watry <HI>Warriours</HI> in one bloody hour)</L>
<L>Could <HI>fearle&s;s</HI> &s;tand, and calm <HI>commands</HI> di&s;pence</L>
<L>VVith <HI>pre&s;ent mind,</HI> and undi&s;turbed &s;en&s;e:</L>
<L>His <HI>Conduct</HI> for his courage did not cea&s;e,</L>
<L>But with the Fury of the Fight <HI>Increa&s;e.</HI></L>
<L>VVhat pity tis tho&s;e Valiant <HI>Hero</HI>'s, who</L>
<L>Can do &s;uch Acts, are not Immortal too</L>
<L>To live as his Eternal Fame mu&s;t do.</L>
<L>Mu&s;t do! whil&s;t there &s;hall la&s;t what <HI>men</HI> call days</L>
<L>Or <HI>Air</HI> to mould one &s;yllable of <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI></L>
<L>So many fierce <HI>Engagements</HI> he had felt,</L>
<L>Reguarding <HI>Broad&s;ides</HI> but as <HI>Pot-Gun</HI> Pelt.</L>
<L>VVe thought him <HI>woundle&s;s,</HI> till death made him Reel</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> like, by nibling at his <HI>Heel;</HI></L>
<L>But as the <HI>Sun</HI> mo&s;t glorious does appear,</L>
<L>And darts the brighte&s;t <HI>raies</HI> when's <HI>&s;ettings</HI> near.</L>
<L>So his la&s;t Scene of Life contracted all,</L>
<L>That we can great, or brave, and wondrous call.</L>
<L>For in his <HI>Countries Cau&s;e,</HI> he nobly Fell,</L>
<L>whil&s;t <HI>Peals of Cannon</HI> Rung his <HI>Par&s;ing Bell</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Victory</HI> attended on his <HI>Knell.</HI></L>
<L>Thus Dy'd he as much <HI>Honour'd</HI> as he Liv'd,</L>
<L>For whom the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> are all &s;o griev'd.</L>
<L>That they <HI>vie</HI> Lamentations without <HI>Pau&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>In a <HI>Va&s;t Grief,</HI> next nothing but its <HI>Cau&s;e;</HI></L>
<L>A Grief! who&s;e <HI>Sighs</HI> commanded by their love</L>
<L>Might line with <HI>Sables</HI> all the <HI>Orbs</HI> above.</L>
<L>And People Mourn &s;o fa&s;t, That <HI>Holland</HI> fears'</L>
<L>A <HI>Second Inundation</HI> from their <HI>Tears.</HI></L>
