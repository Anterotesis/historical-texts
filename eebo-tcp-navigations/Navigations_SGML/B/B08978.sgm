<OPENER>Humbly Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioners and their Predece&s;&s;ors, upon the Encouragement of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and &s;ucceeding Princes, by their &s;everal Royal Grants and Charters, granted unto them exclu&s;ive, to all others have adventured their E&s;tates, for the di&s;covering and carrying on a Traffick to tho&s;e remote Parts; greatly to the Advantage of the Navigation of this Kingdom, and to the Enriching of the &s;ame, as well by what imported by them, as by the Exportation again of &s;uch Commodities, for the carrying on a Foreign Trade to the Plantations; <HI>Spain, Italy, Turkey,</HI> &amp;c. And that your Petitioners have been informed, and did always believe, that according to the Ancient U&s;age of their Predece&s;&s;ors, they might legally manage their Trade, and E&s;tabli&s;h and Govern the Colonies, Forts, and Gari&s;ons of their Propriety, within the Limits of their Charters, by Virtue of, and in conformity to, the &s;everal Grants and Charters from the Crown to them and their Predece&s;&s;ors, from the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;aid Trade; and that &s;everal Parliaments &s;ince that time, have had many occa&s;ions to take notice of their &s;aid Charters, without any Di&s;allowance thereunto, but on the contrary, rather implicitely approv'd thereof: But your Petitioners have lately received great damages and di&s;couragements in their &s;aid Trade, by &s;everal private Traders or Interlopers, who Originally were the Cau&s;e of all tho&s;e Troubles and Lo&s;&s;es brought of late on the &s;aid Com|pany.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">
<P> Your Petitioners do therefore humbly repre&s;ent to this Honourable Hou&s;e, That the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;upported, but in a Joint-Stock, exclu&s;ive to all others, nor without &s;uch Powers granted unto them, equal to that of their Neighbours; by which they uphold their Trade, and that while Matters &s;tands thus; the &s;aid <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, and &s;uch other Foreign-Trades from <HI>England</HI> as depends thereon, will not only &s;uffer much; but other <HI>European</HI> Nations will make great Advantage thereof, to the Hazard, if not the utter Ruine and Lo&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce to tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Your Petitioners do therefore mo&s;t humbly pray this-Honourable Hou&s;e will be plea&s;ed to take the Premi&s;&s;es into their mo&s;t prudent con&s;i|derations, and to apply &s;uch &s;ea&s;onable Remedies for the Pre&s;erva|tion of this great and important Trade to the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Nation; and on which &s;o many other Foreign Trades in a great Mea&s;ure depend, as to &s;ettle the &s;ame by Act of Parliament, under &s;uch Methods or Regulations as this Honourable Hou&s;e &s;hall think fit, unto which your Petitioners &s;hall at all times mo&s;t humbly &s;ubmit: And that in the mean time your Petitioners may be &s;upported and encouraged in pre&s;erving the &s;aid Trade to the Nation in &s;uch manner, and by &s;uch means, as this Honourable Hou&s;e in their great Wi&s;dom &s;hall think requi&s;ite.</HI></P>
