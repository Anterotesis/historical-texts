<P><HI>_GEntlemen, I pre&s;ent you here</HI> with the fift book of <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> of who&s;e delectable hi&s;tory you haue al|ready peru&s;ed the fir&s;t and &s;econd books: wherefore it may bee, you rather expect the third and fourth bookes to come forth in due cour&s;e, then that the fift &s;hould thus vntimely appeare before the re&s;t. The cau&s;e of which vnorderly proceeding, grew from this occa&s;ion: J hauing only intere&s;t in this and the fol|lowing bookes of Amadis, haue already &s;et out this fift booke, being the fir&s;t of tho&s;e which are in my hands, and al&s;o doth begin with the hy&s;tory of E&s;plandian, being the &s;onne of Amadis: intending by Gods grace to proceed with the others in due order as time doth permit. But as concerning the other Bookes which rest in another mans right, as they are not in my power, &s;o can J make no promi&s;e when they &s;hall bee publi&s;hed: wherefore &s;eeing that matter remaines wholly to his will, I being ignorant

<HEAD>CHAP. I. How E&s;plandian &s;leeping in the great &s;erpent, when hee awaked, he found him&s;elfe to bee at the foot of the rocke of the Enchaun|tre&s;&s;e, and what happened vnto him.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_ESplandian</HI> that had fallen a&s;l&eacute;epe in the &s;erpent by meanes of the melodious noi&s;e of trumpets, that the &s;ixe Gentle|women &s;ounded along the &s;hoare, after he had receiued the order of knighthood, as it hath ben declared vnto you in the end of our fourth booke, when hee awa|ked was much aba&s;hed that he &s;aw not any of the company that were there pre&s;ent when the Giant <HI>Balan</HI> dubbed him knight, but found him&s;elfe alone betw&eacute;ene the wings of that mon&s;trous bea&s;t, at the foot of a rocke vnknowne to him, which rocke was &s;o high, that hee thought it impo&s;&s;ible to climbe vp, but hee was per&s;ua|ded that <HI>Vrganda la De&s;cogneue</HI> (who&s;e workes and enterpri&s;es were mo&s;t wonderfull) had ordained it to be &s;o, and therevpon he
<PB REF="4"> comforted him&s;elfe, going down into the body of the &s;hip (where the day before that great a&s;&s;emblie had ben) but he found no man; and &s;&eacute;eking further, hee went into the chappel, where hee e&s;pied <HI>Sergil</HI> his &s;quire fa&s;t &s;l&eacute;eping, and hard by him two old men with rols on their heads, apparrelled like Turkes: with that he went to <HI>Sergil,</HI> and with his foot gaue him &s;uch a thru&s;t, that on a &s;odain he &s;tarted vp, and &s;peaking to his mai&s;ter (as though hee had ne|uer &s;&eacute;ene him before) a&s;ked him what he meant, whereat <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> began to laugh, and &s;aid vnto him: Good God, <HI>Sergil,</HI> ha&s;t thou ben in my company all thy life time, and knowe&s;t mee no better? and taking him by the hand, he drew him in &s;uch maner to him that therewith hee awaked, much a&s;hamed to haue com|mitted &s;uch a fault: whereof &s;&eacute;eking to excu&s;e him&s;elfe, hee &s;aid vnto his mai&s;ter, By my faith &s;ir, I was &s;o fa&s;t a&s;l&eacute;epe when you called me, that I neither remembred you nor my &s;elfe, and I am now more aba&s;hed then I was before to think how I fel into &s;o &s;ound a &s;l&eacute;epe: That cannot I tel (an&s;wered <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) although as much hath happened vnto me. Then he told him that hee had &s;lept, and when he awaked he found him&s;elfe alone betw&eacute;ene the wings of the Serpent, without any of the company that were with him when hee receiued the order of knighthood, and now (&s;aid he) we are arriued at the foot of the highe&s;t rocke that euer I &s;aw, and withall it is &s;o hard and difficult to climbe vp, that I can find neither path nor way how to doe it, yet haue I beheld it long, but (as I perceiue) it is enuironned with the &s;ea in &s;uch manner, that con&s;idering the &s;cituation of the place, I certainly bel&eacute;eue it is the rocke of the Enchauntre&s;&s;e, whereof in times pa&s;t thou ha&s;t heard by <HI>Amadis</HI> my father. And as they were in this manner &s;peaking, <HI>Sergil</HI> heard the two old men &s;nort (that as yet they had not once perceiued) and demanded of <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> if he knew them not: As God helpe me no (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) for as farre as I remember I neuer &s;aw them before, but I iudge that <HI>Vrganda</HI> hath left them here to helpe vs if we n&eacute;ed. I pray you &s;aid <HI>Sergil</HI> let vs awake them: then hee called them &s;o lowd that they ro&s;e vp, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> a&s;king them who brought them thether, but they made &s;ignes that they could not &s;peake. It was then
<PB REF="4"> about twelue of the clocke, and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> would willingly haue eaten if he had found meat, and &s;aid vnto <HI>Sergil,</HI> Friend, neuer in all my life had I &s;o good an appetite to eat as I haue now, but I doubt we &s;hall find no victuals in the &s;hip, I pray th&eacute;e <HI>Sergil</HI> let vs go &s;&eacute;e, for as I perceiue, if we tru&s;t vnto the&s;e dumbe men, we are like to fare but hardly: but the dumbe men perceiued well what he meant: wherefore going out of the chappell they entred into a chamber that ioined to the hall, from whence they pre&s;ent|ly returned, bringing with them &s;uch quantity of meate that <HI>E|&s;plandian</HI> and <HI>Sergil</HI> were neuer better &s;ati&s;fied in all their liues: hauing dined &amp; the tables vncouered, they went vnto the place where <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had &s;lept, from whence hee &s;hewed <HI>Sergil</HI> the rocke whereof hee had told him before, &s;aying: A&s;&s;ure thy &s;elfe <HI>Sergil,</HI> &s;&eacute;eing the &s;erpent &s;tirreth not from hence, it is a &s;igne that I mu&s;t goe vpon this high rock to &s;&eacute;e if there be any aduentures, and if I can bring them to an end I know not (an&s;wered <HI>Sergil</HI>) what you will doe, but if you tru&s;t to the coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ell of our dumbe men we &s;hall &s;tay long ynough here before we haue any wordes of them. Let vs land (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) and with that hee made &s;ignes to the old men, that they &s;hould hai&s;e out the boat, where|vnto they willingly obeied: which done, the fir&s;t that entred was <HI>Sergil,</HI> then <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> (armed in the &s;ame armour he ware when the great <HI>Balan</HI> dubbed him knight) and rowing with their oares they made towards the rocke, at the foot whereof they de&s;cended out of the boat, leauing the two dumbe men alone in the &s;erpent, and as they were looking for a way to get vp, they found y^e &s;ame path that <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>Gran&s;ador</HI> had taken when they went vp to &s;&eacute;e the &s;trange aduentures that the Enchauntere&s;&s;e had left there, and they had not trauelled long, but that <HI>Sergil</HI> perceiued his mai&s;ter to want a &s;word, (for of all other armour he was wel furni&s;hed when hee receiued the order of knighthood onely of a &s;word) wherefore he &s;aid vnto him: &s;ir, I know not whether you meane to goe, but if we pa&s;&s;e forward, and that vpon the top of this rock, if you find any dangerous aduenture, you haue nothing to defend your &s;elfe withall, but if you will bel&eacute;eue me, you &s;hall rather take an oare out of our boat, for oftentimes the &s;toute&s;t
<PB REF="5"> man is ouercome, not for want of courage or &s;tomacke to re&s;i&s;t, but for want of weapons to defend him&s;elfe, and with that hee went backe vnto the boat, and bringing one of the oares with him, gaue it to his mai&s;ter, in which maner they began to mount vpon the rocke not without great paine, the way being &s;o diffi|cult, the aire hote, and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> heauily armed. Notwith&s;tan|ding they cea&s;ed not to trauaile day and night, till they arriued at the Hermitage, where the image of bra&s;&s;e &s;tood with a &s;crole of writing at his f&eacute;et (as you haue read in the fourth book) which as then they could not di&s;cerne by rea&s;on it was darke, wherfore they determined to pa&s;&s;e the night vnder the gate, not entering any further, for it was extreame whote. Then <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> put off his helmet, and laying downe his &s;hield, eate &s;uch meate as his Squire had brought with him: which done, lying downe vpon the gra&s;&s;e he &s;lept till the morning that he and <HI>Sergil</HI> entered into the chappell, where they beheld the image and the writing, but neither of them could read it becau&s;e the letters were in Gr&eacute;ek, which they vnder&s;tood not. Then <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> determining to goe further, &s;aid to <HI>Sergil,</HI> Friend, it is be&s;t for you to &s;tay here till I come againe, for if this be the rocke where my father &amp; <HI>Gran|&s;ador</HI> (whether it weare by fortune or willingly) did once arriue, I remember I haue heard them tell, that in Summer the aire is &s;o whote therein that it br&eacute;edeth many venomous bea&s;ts, where|by thou mighte&s;t receiue &s;ome harme, being no better armed the~ thou art, but as for mee thou knowe&s;t I am prede&s;tined to tho&s;e aduentures that other men haue failed to accompli&s;h, which put|teth me in hope either that I &s;hall not liue long, or I &s;hal accom|pli&s;h the things that are fore&s;hewed of me, and by that meanes &s;hall conquer the &s;word and the trea&s;ure, that for certaine is &s;aid to be in an old pallace within this rocke. What, &s;aid <HI>Sergil,</HI> Doe you think that although I &s;hould die a thou&s;and deaths I would refu&s;e to goe with you? No by my faith, for I know that without your company life wil be irk&s;omer to me then a thou&s;and deaths if a man could indure &s;o many. Friend an&s;wered <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> I bel&eacute;eue it wel, neuerthele&s;&s;e if any inconuenience &s;hould happen vnto th&eacute;e, be&s;ides the blame I might receiue thereby, thy deede
<PB REF="5"> would be more e&s;t&eacute;emed folly, then done of any courage: but not to me that haue both armor and &s;hield to fight again&s;t the &s;tron|ge&s;t enemy that may bee found, wherefore I pray th&eacute;e once a|gaine doe as I would haue th&eacute;e. Wherewith <HI>Sergil</HI> perceiuing no remedy, turned his head a&s;ide and began to w&eacute;epe. In y^e mean time <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> laced on his helmet, and hanging his &s;hield a|bout his necke with the oare on his &s;houlder, kept on the pathes that at the la&s;t brought him to the top of the rocke, and being there hee went towards the broken ca&s;tle, where hee perceiued the other Image with the table that &s;he held in her left hand, the contents whereof he could no more vnder&s;tand then that of the Hermitage, wherfore without longer &s;taying he pa&s;&s;ed forward towards the chamber where the trea&s;ure lay, being continually guarded by a mo&s;t great and horrible &s;erpent: and as hee went n&eacute;erer to it, he perceiued y^e gates to be of hard &s;tone, where there was a &s;word &s;o farre thru&s;t in, that nothing but the handle could be &s;&eacute;ene, wherewith he thought it to be the &s;ame whereof he had heard, and being moued with great de&s;ire to haue it, he determi|ned (although he had but a &s;taffe to defend him&s;elfe) to a&s;&s;aile the bea&s;t, what&s;oeuer happened thereby. And to the &s;ame end with a bold courage he &s;et forwards, but the &s;erpent (that as the~ &s;lept) awaked, and looking with a cruell countenance vpon <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> began to hi&s;&s;e, and ca&s;t out fire at he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> mouth as if &s;hee would de|uour him. Neuerthele&s;&s;e <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> couered with his &s;hield went n&eacute;ere vnto her, and with his oare gaue her &s;uch a blow betw&eacute;ene the eares, that with the force hee v&s;ed, it had almo&s;t fallen out of his hands. Notwith&s;tanding the bea&s;t made towards him &s;o fu|riou&s;ly that &s;he ouerthrew him on the ground and troad vpon his belly, whereat h&eacute;e was not a little aba&s;hed, but perceiuing what danger hee was in, &s;odainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">art vp, and by little and little got to the gate wherein the &s;word &s;tucke, which at the la&s;t hee laid hold vpon, and with both hands drew it to him with &s;uch force that he puld it out: and with that the gates opened with &s;o feare|full a noi&s;e, that pre&s;ently the &s;erpent fell dead vpon the ground, and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed that he knew not what hee did, but it was no meruel for that <HI>Sergil</HI> that &s;taied in the hermitage,
<PB REF="6"> farre from thence was in the greate&s;t feare that euer he had, and be&s;ides the &s;aylers that as then &s;ayled along the coa&s;t, thought verely the rocke would haue fallen into the &s;ea, &s;o great was the noi&s;e at the opening of the gate. Meane time <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> lay in a &s;woune till midnight following that he opened his eies, when he &s;aw a great brightne&s;&s;e in the place, perceiuing the &s;erpent dead and the inchanted &s;word lying by his &s;ide, which hee tooke in his hand, and ri&s;ing vp entred into the chamber, in the middle wher|of he &s;aw a tombe &s;hining brighter then fire, and vpon it a great lion of bra&s;&s;e, holding in his right paw the &s;cabberd of the &s;word, from whence the great brightne&s;&s;e i&s;&s;ued, and in his left a roll of letters written in Latine, The contents whereof doe follow.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. How <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> hauing read the writing contained in the roll that the Lyon held, tooke the &s;hining &s;cabberd, and what &s;peech hee and <HI>Sergil</HI> had together.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THe fearefull cries at the time of the great con&s;traint, &s;hal force thee (O thou Knight that ha&s;t conquered the &s;word) to returne againe to conquer the great trea&s;ure wher|by thy ioy &s;hal be re&s;tored in &s;uch &s;ort, that the kindled flames, by who&s;e beames thou &s;halt farre off be wounded (&s;hal bee extin|gui&s;hed, &amp; content thy &s;elfe with this glo|rious conque&s;t thou ha&s;t made: for that variable fortune had aduan|ced thee before all others, and thou ha&s;t obtained the honor wher|vnto &s;o many good knights could neuer attaine, notwith&s;tanding all their Prowe&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>E&s;plandian</HI> hauing read and again peru&s;ed the contents of the writing, for a time &s;tood mu&s;ing thereon, and in the end percei|ued thereby, that although hee had brought the aduenture of the &s;word vnto an end, yet he &s;hould be con&s;trained to attend y^e time appointed (according to the contents of the writing) neuerthe|le&s;&s;e
<PB REF="6"> hee knew not the meaning thereof, being as then at libertie and fr&eacute;e from all the pa&s;&s;ions of loue. Notwith&s;tanding the cru|ell Tyrant Loue, afterward obtained &s;o great a conque&s;t again&s;t him, that hee made him fall in loue with her that hee neuer had &s;&eacute;ene, nor neuer was in her company, as reading further in this hi&s;tory you &s;hall at large perceiue. Then he laied hand vpon the &s;cabbard, and put the &s;word into it, thanking God deuoutly for the grace he had obtained. After that he went diuers times about the tombe to &s;&eacute;e if he could open it without breaking, but he per|ceiued the chri&s;tall, from whence i&s;&s;ued part of the brightne&s;&s;e to be couered with another plate coloured like azure, &s;o wonderful|ly wrought that it would &s;car&s;e b&eacute;e iudged whether it were mar|ble, mettall, or any other &s;tuffe: whereupon he left off his enter|pri&s;e, and returned into the hall where the dead &s;erpent lay, but as then neither y^e &s;word nor the &s;cabberd y&eacute;elded any &s;uch bright|ne&s;&s;e as before they did, becau&s;e it was day: Then going out h&eacute;e went downe againe towards the Hermitage where hee had left his Squier, who being melancholy and ama&s;ed at the long ab|&s;ence of his mai&s;ter, (fearing &s;ome danger happened vnto him) was gone out of the Hermitage to &s;&eacute;eke him, and he had not tra|uelled farre, but hee perceiued him comming with the &s;word by his &s;ide, whereat he made &s;uch ioy, that being yet farre from him, he cried out and &s;aid, O my lord, ble&s;&s;ed bee God that hath giuen you &s;o good a beginning wherat euery man &s;hal wonder. Friend (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) he hath yet done more for mee then thou woul|de&s;t thinke, and with that hee began from point to point to &s;hew him the danger wherein he was, and being in that di&s;cour&s;e, it waxed darke euen then when they arriued at the Hermitage: wherefore they determined not to trauel any further that night, but laied them downe vnder the next tr&eacute;es they came vnto, &s;till &s;peaking of the &s;trangene&s;&s;e of the place: whereat <HI>Sergil</HI> being more aba&s;hed then before, could not refraine to &s;ay: As God help me Mai&s;ter, by good rea&s;on you may b&eacute;e e&s;t&eacute;emed a better knight then <HI>Amadis</HI> your father, that came into this place, and &s;aw the Image at the Hermitage, the writing that &s;tandeth vpon the arch of &s;tone, the &s;erpent, the &s;word that &s;tuck in the gate where
<PB REF="7"> you found it, and the &s;hining tombe, yet dur&s;t he neuer proue any of the&s;e aduentures, and h&eacute;e &s;aied true, for <HI>Amadis</HI> knew well by the contents of the letters written in Gr&eacute;eke, that tho&s;e aduen|tures were ordained for his &s;onne <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and therefore vn|dertooke them not, but all others, onely <HI>Gran&s;ador</HI> and <HI>Vrganda</HI> knew it not til the~, but although <HI>Sergil</HI> thought to plea&s;e his ma|&s;ter v&s;ing &s;uch words in his commendation, yet <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> tooke it not &s;o well, &s;aying: I pray th&eacute;e <HI>Sergil</HI> neuer v&s;e &s;uch &s;p&eacute;eches, for if the Prowe&s;&s;e and knightly aduentures of my Father had ben as well employed to the aduancing of the Chri&s;tian faith as they were to win and obtaine honour in this world, I thinke his like would not be found, but hauing pa&s;&s;ed his youth in things &s;o vaine and tran&s;itory, doubtle&s;&s;e his glory is the le&s;&s;e, not that I pre&s;ume in any thing to accu&s;e him, and God forbid I &s;hould, yet is hee knowne in &s;o many places to bee &s;o valiant a knight, that who&s;oeuer he be can &s;econd him may well e&s;t&eacute;eme him&s;elfe hap|py among the happie&s;t, wherefore I pray th&eacute;e let vs talk of other matters. Thus &s;ometimes talking and other whiles &s;l&eacute;eping, day began to appeare, when they ro&s;e vp, taking their way to|wards the &s;ea &s;ide, de&s;cending downe the rocke, till they came where the two dumbe men &s;taied for them, one within the &s;hip, the other in a little barke, wherein <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> entred, according to the &s;ign the dumb man had made, and <HI>Sergil</HI> went into the &s;er|pent, and with that they departed, and the barke &s;ayled &s;o &s;wift|ly, that in &s;hort &s;pace they left the &s;ight one of the other.

<P>_TEnne daies and as many nights together y^e black knight and the dumbe man &s;ayled on the &s;ea, not knowing in what parts they were, for if he had enquired of his guide, it had ben but labor lo&s;t: y^e eleuenth day they di&s;couered a great &amp; plea&s;ant I&s;land, where the knight being wearied with the impetuo&s;ity of the waues, de&s;ired his guide to put his barke on &s;hoare, but he regarding not his words, thru&s;t it n&eacute;ere vnto a high rocke, by nature cut in &s;uch manner, that it &s;&eacute;emed a wall purpo&s;ely made for the defence thereof: and the countrey was &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> of woods and bu&s;hes, that it might be e&s;t&eacute;emed vnhabitable. Then the dumbe man &s;hewed him a path that led him vp to the rocke, and made him a &s;igne to goe thether, where with he i&s;&s;ued out of the barke, armed at all points, and began to mount vp, the weather was then extreame hote, whereby the knight was &s;o cha&s;ed in his harne&s;s, y^t he was con&s;trained to put off his helmet &amp; carry it in his hand, till he perceiued a little Hermitage among the bu&s;hes, &amp; before it &s;tood a high cro&s;&s;e, which plea&s;ed him well, not only for the hope he had to find &s;ome one of whom hee might enquire in what countrey hee was, but becau&s;e hee was a&s;&s;ured that there dwelt a Chri&s;tian, and with that h&eacute;e perceiued a man apparrelled like an Hermite, &s;o old and withered that his long white beard hung downe to his girdle, carrying in his hand a pitcher of water, that he had drawne out of a fountaine not farre from thence, and was pa&s;&s;ing by when the knight &s;pake vnto him, &s;aying: Father, God &s;aue you, which when the good man heard, he was in &s;o great a ma&s;e, that for feare his pitcher fell out of his hand and brake in p&eacute;eces. Neuerthele&s;&s;e by little and little
<PB REF="8"> he came to him&s;elfe againe, and perceiuing him that &s;pake vnto him, an&s;wered and &s;aid, My &s;onne, it is now twenty years pa&s;t fithence I left the plea&s;ures of this world, and for&s;eek my natiue &s;oile to obtaine the grace of God, and that which mo&s;t aba&s;heth m&eacute;e is, that &s;ince the time whereof I &s;peake I neuer found man that as yet &s;aluted mee in this manner, and I thinke verely you are a &s;tranger in the&s;e countries, or els your &s;p&eacute;ech and apparell di&s;gui&s;eth you much. Father (&s;aid the knight) true it is I am a &s;tranger, brought hether by &s;uch meanes, that I neither know the country where I am, nor any man or woma~ inhabiting ther|in, for you are the fir&s;t creature that I met &s;ince I arriued here, of whom I might enquire, a&s;&s;uring you that when I perceiued this cro&s;&s;e it reioiced my heart, for it is the armes of the mai&s;ter that I &s;erue. What &s;aied the Hermit, doe you then know the vertue thereof? I, an&s;wered the knight, that I doe, being well a&s;&s;ured that vpon the like cro&s;&s;e our Red&eacute;emer (whereof I &s;peak) &s;uffered death and pa&s;&s;ion. Alas &s;aied the holy man, you &s;ay true, prai&s;ed be his holy name, that once before I die he hath giuen me the grace to let me &s;&eacute;e a man on this &s;ide the &s;ea that bel&eacute;eueth in him, a&s;&s;uring you &s;ir knight that you and I are onely the two creatures in this country that are Chri&s;tians, for all the re&s;tare Pagans and idolaters. And as he would haue proc&eacute;eded further, his &s;p&eacute;ech failed him, doubting that hee to whom hee &s;pake, was but a fanta&s;ie or &s;hadow of a man, but at the la&s;t he waxt bolder, and in maner of coniuration a&s;ked him if he were a mortall man or not? Mortall (an&s;wered the knight) that I am for certain, and withall a &s;inner, which di&s;plea&s;eth mee much, and if it aba&s;heth you at this pre&s;ent to &s;&eacute;e mee here, I am my &s;elfe no le&s;&s;e aba&s;hed to &s;&eacute;e you: for without doubt the manner of my arriuall in this countrey hath b&eacute;en &s;uch and &s;o &s;trange, that I can render you no rea&s;on thereof, but if you know the countrey where in w&eacute;e are, I be&s;&eacute;ech you good Father tell it me to put me out of doubt. Gladly (&s;aid the Hermite) and with that he tooke him by the hand, &amp; led him to his Hermitage, and there &s;itting downe together vpon a log of wood, the old man began to &s;peake in this maner, and &s;aid,
<PB REF="8"> Now &s;ir knight, tell mee I pray you what countryman you are, Father (&s;aid he) Great Brittaine is the countrey where in my youth I was borne and bred, I know not if euer you were ac|quainted therewith: How long is it &s;aid the Hermite &s;ince you came from thence? It is fift&eacute;ene daies &amp; more &s;ince I was there &s;aid the knight, did you neuer know king <HI>Li&s;uart</HI> (&s;aied the Her|mite) that in my time raigned therin? Yes truly (&s;aid the knight) for I haue &s;&eacute;ene him many times: how did hee when you came from thence &s;aid the Hermite? That can I not certainely &s;hew &s;aid the knight, for h&eacute;e was lo&s;t and led away from thence, but by whom or in what manner no man cantell, notwith&s;tanding the great paine and diligence diuers of his knights haue v&s;ed to find him out. When the Hermite heard that, he &s;&eacute;emed very pen&s;iue, which the knight perceiuing, thought in his mind that hee could tell him &s;ome newes, where vpon he began to behold him well in the face to &s;&eacute;e if h&eacute;e changed colour, with that the Hermite (that well perceiued the Knights meaning) &s;aid vnto him. Truly Sir Knight, not without cau&s;e haue I enquired &s;o much touching King <HI>Li&s;uart,</HI> but before I will &s;hew you my rea&s;on why, you &s;hal vnder&s;tand that I am of great Brittaine as well as you, where as yet the greate&s;t part of my kindred are liuing, whome I for|&s;ooke at the &s;ame time that a Gyant lord of this country married with a lady who as then I &s;erued, and with her pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, not only hoping to reape &s;ome reward for my former &s;eruice, but (as yong men are moued) with a great de&s;ire to &s;&eacute;e &s;trange coun|tries, but it fortuned, that my mi&s;tre&s;&s;e being for&s;aken of God, as &s;oone as &s;hee arriued in this countrey, left his holy law to receiue the law of her hu&s;band, wherefore con&s;idering with my &s;elf, that by rea&s;on as wel of my natural weakene&s;&s;e, as by often frequen|ting the company of the&s;e countrymen I might fal into &s;ome er|ror, I determined to withdraw my &s;elfe into this place, wherein I haue endured much paine and mi&s;ery, to the great daunger of my life, by rea&s;on of the controuer&s;ie betw&eacute;ene the law of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, which I hold, and the law of the Pagans that &s;&eacute;eke daily to de&s;troy it, that without the fauour of my mi&s;tre&s;&s;e that would not &s;uffer them to di&s;plea&s;e me, I had not liued &s;o long as I haue
<PB REF="9" MS="y"> done among them, but when it plea&s;eth God I wil depart hence, and returne again into mine own country, now you haue heard how I haue hetherto liued, I pray you &s;ir knight (&s;aid hee) &s;hew mee your aduentures, and who hath brought you into this place from whence very hardly you will euer be able to returne again, but rather are in danger of mo&s;t cruell death, or to indure the mo&s;t horrible impri&s;onme~t that euer was heard of, which would gr&eacute;eue me much, not only for the great beauty and young yeares that I perceiue to be in you, but for that you are my natiue coun|tryman. Father an&s;wered the knight, you haue done mee great plea&s;ure to &s;hew me the manner of your life and bringing vp, ne|uerthele&s;&s;e before I &s;ati&s;fie your reque&s;t, tell mee (if it plea&s;eth you) wherfore when you &s;pake of king <HI>Li&s;uart</HI> you &s;&eacute;emed &s;o &s;ad, which made mee coniecture that you know &s;ome thing touching him. Sonne (&s;aid the Hermit) you &s;hall vnder&s;tand that a dough|ter of mine, &s;eruant to the lady whereof I &s;pake, not long &s;ince came hether to &s;&eacute;e me, and told mee that hee mi&s;tre&s;&s;e returning from great Brittaine, whether &s;hee went to deliuer a brother of hers out of pri&s;on, brought with her very &s;ecretly a knight of great e&s;timation as &s;hee &s;aid, neuerthele&s;&s;e I cannot a&s;&s;ure you who it is: but as I haue learned &s;ince, they &s;ay the two Giants &s;onnes were much plea&s;ed therewith, which maketh mee doubt, con&s;idering the newes you haue &s;hewed mee touching king <HI>Lui|&s;art,</HI> that he is mo&s;t likely to be the man, for &s;h&eacute;e is &s;o well &s;&eacute;ene in the art of Nigromancy and Magicke, that oftentimes &s;hee pro|cureth mi&s;chief vnto tho&s;e that neuer offended her. And in what countrey are wee now (&s;aid the knight?) You are betw&eacute;ene the marches of Turky and Gr&eacute;ece &s;aid the Hermite, for this moun|taine parteth both the countries, but it is &s;o &s;trong, not onely by nature, but by art, that neither of the two Princes of tho&s;e coun|tries, what force &s;oeuer they brought hether, could neuer win it. And now a Giant (&s;onne vnto my lady and mi&s;tre&s;&s;e) and one of the mo&s;t &s;tronge&s;t and pui&s;&s;ant knights in y^e Ea&s;t parts, (as ma|ny of his neighbours, who&s;e goods hee hath by force v&s;urped, and that in de&s;pight of the Emperour, or any other contradicting the &s;ame haue proued) is lord thereof. Where dwelleth hee (&s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d the
<PB REF="9" MS="y"> knight?) Aboue vpon y^e rock (&s;aid the Hermite) in a ca&s;tle which he hath mo&s;t &s;trongly fortefied, and is kept with all diligence and care by a Giant one of his brethren, with others, of as good con|dition as them&s;elues, and which is more, it is not po&s;&s;ible to come n&eacute;er y^e ca&s;tle, but by a little path way whereon the &s;ea continual|ly beateth, at the end whereof there is a pair of &s;taires cut out of the rocke, whereby you mount vp till you come to an yron gate, where a villaine, in whom the lord of the ca&s;tle putteth his tru&s;t, watcheth continually, for there is no other entery, but onely the great gate that is defended with &s;trong platformes and great Towers, in the middle whereof there is a dore &s;o &s;traight, that a man on hor&s;ebacke can hardly enter therein, and that way mo&s;t commonly tho&s;e of the ca&s;tle doe v&s;e to i&s;&s;ue forth. Before it bee night &s;aid the knight, I meane to &s;&eacute;e what manner of place it is, &amp; if I can I will know who it is, that was &s;o lately brought the|ther. God k&eacute;epe you from thence (&s;aied the Hermite) for thereby you will either procure your owne death, or at the lea&s;t perpetu|all impri&s;onment. Happen what may (&s;aid y^e knight) I wil proue what fortune it &s;hall plea&s;e God to &s;end mee. That were but ill done of you (&s;aid the Hermite) for that men are bound to imploy their forces only in things that &s;tand with rea&s;on and po&s;&s;ibilitie thereby to reap a benefit by their labors, otherwi&s;e they are to be e&s;t&eacute;emed de&s;perat fools, &amp; not valiant &amp; hardy knights adue~turing (without due re&s;pect) not only their bodies, but their &s;ouls which are of greater price, and Chri&s;t him&s;elfe hath by example plaine|ly &s;hewed it vnto vs, for when the Deuil came and tempted him, bidding him doe certain things, which in d&eacute;ed (as he was Chri&s;t) were po&s;&s;ible, but as be was man were impo&s;&s;ible to doe, hee an|&s;wered him that hee &s;hould not tempt the Lord his God. So my good &s;onne (&s;aid hee) I would adui&s;e you to de&s;i&s;t from &s;o vnrea&s;o|nable an enterpri&s;e. You may preach what you will to per&s;uade me to the contrary (&s;aid the knight) but I mu&s;t do that where vn|to I am called, which is to prooue my &s;elfe in tho&s;e aduentures that in mans iudgement &s;&eacute;eme impo&s;&s;ible: otherwi&s;e tho&s;e that haue fore&s;hewed of me, &s;hould not onely haue trauelled in vaine, but bee e&s;t&eacute;emed liers and fooles. If then their &s;ayings bee true,
<PB REF="10"> what greater honour can I obtain then bringing mo&s;t wonder|ful aduentures to an end, I may from henceforth therby re&s;train the rage and fury of &s;uch men as hurt, and do iniury vnto others, contrary to the laws of God and man? And if they be found liers I had rather they &s;hold be reproued for their want of knowledge then I accu&s;ed of any point of cowardi&s;e. And if the wor&s;t fal out I will imploy my force again&s;t &s;uch accur&s;ed people, (members and mini&s;ters of the deuill) whom by the help of God I &s;hal ouer|come: and I bel&eacute;eue and am certainely per&s;uaded (that if I die in tho&s;e aduentures) hee will receiue my &s;oule into his heauenly ioy. The Hermite meruailed much to heare the blacke knight &s;peake &s;o wi&s;ely, and with &s;o great a courage, neuerthele&s;&s;e the great beautie and yoong yeares h&eacute;e perceiued him to haue, moued him to &s;o great compa&s;&s;ion, that the teares ranne downe his eies, and therewith he &s;aied, Ha good knight, hee in whome thou tru&s;te&s;t, pre&s;erue th&eacute;e and &s;end th&eacute;e long life, and &s;&eacute;eing thou art re&s;olutely determined to pa&s;&s;e forward, I pray th&eacute;e deferre the time for this night, for it is already &s;o late, that although thou &s;houlde&s;t haue time inough to get vnto the gate before the &s;unne goeth downe yet &s;halt thou find it &s;hut as it is accu&s;tomed to be, wherevpon the Knight kept the Hermite company till the next day in the morning.</P>

Then the blacke knight went in, and entred in|to a vaut, meane time the gate was that whereby the place &s;&eacute;e|med very darke, for there entred no light but only by a little hole that came through the rocke, and as he pa&s;&s;ed forward, the Por|ter that was behind, &s;taying him, &s;aied vnto him Villaine, leaue thy armour here, and I will bring th&eacute;e where the lords of the ca|&s;tle &s;hall reward th&eacute;e according to thy de&s;ertes.

But I will not (&s;aied he) lea&s;t I lo&s;e too much by th&eacute;e, for then my companion will haue thy ar|mour, which by right is mine, and with that he lifted vp his hat|chet, thinking to cleaue his head, whereat the blacke knight &s;tept backe, and with his &s;word gaue him &s;uch a blow, that hee ouer|threw him on the ground, and &s;tepping vpon him, thru&s;t him in|to the body, and as hee had done, there entered at the gate (that went out of the vaut) a villaine all armed, who thinking to &s;peak to the Porter, with a rude and churli&s;h voice, &s;aid <HI>Argantes,</HI> why &s;taye&s;t thou &s;o long to bring vp that accur&s;ed wretch that euen now entred at the gate?

Then &s;tay (&s;aid <HI>Frerion</HI>) and thou &s;halt &s;&eacute;e how I will teach th&eacute;e to preach in other &s;ort, and with that hee &s;hut the dore and went in to arme him, meane time the blacke knight &s;ate downe vpon a marble &s;tone, and he had not re&s;ted long, but the Gyant came a|gaine, who bringing a great cimitere vpon his &s;houlder, would haue i&s;&s;ued at the gate, when the knight &s;pake vnto him, &s;aying. Stay a little I pray th&eacute;e before thou comme&s;t foorth, and graunt me one reque&s;t which in right thou can&s;t not well deny mee, for although neither courte&s;ie nor any part thereof did euer lodge within thy brea&s;t, that habite of knighthood wherewith thou art inue&s;ted, ought more to mooue th&eacute;e to humanity then thy nature of it &s;elfe affordeth. A&s;ke what thou wilt (&s;aied the Giant) and it may be thou &s;halt be refu&s;ed, both thou and I (&s;aid the knight) are now on foote, I pray th&eacute;e then let vs fight in the other court, that tho&s;e of thy ca&s;tle may behold the pa&s;time: which hee &s;aied to the end that if he ouercame his enemie as he doubted not therof, they &s;hould not &s;hut him out. By my head (&s;aid the Giant) at the fir&s;t, I thought thou woulde&s;t haue a&s;ked mercy at my handes, which would not much auaile th&eacute;e: but &s;&eacute;eing thy reque&s;t is no other, I am content to graunt it, although a meanes to flie away were much more aduantage vnto th&eacute;e, which the&s;e high wals will not permit th&eacute;e, if thou be once inclo&s;ed within them. Thou &s;peake&s;t (&s;aid the blacke knight) as thy nature y&eacute;eldeth, and I as vertue bindeth me, for the re&s;t let God worke his will. Come in then (&s;aid <HI>Frerion</HI>) and defend thy &s;elfe from mee if thou can&s;t. With that the black knight entred into a faire court pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">d with white marble, all galleried about and &s;upported with pillers of Pur|phire, in the midde&s;t whereof &s;toode the portall that entered into the hou&s;e, where an old lady accompanied of diuers yong gentle|women &s;toode looking forth, to whom the Giant went, and kn&eacute;e|ling
<PB REF="12"> on his kn&eacute;e, &s;aid vnto her: Madame, I mo&s;t humbly be&s;&eacute;ech you, that neither for good nor euill which may happen vnto me in fighting with this knight, not one of your hou&s;e b&eacute;e &s;o bold to help or fauour me in any &s;ort, for I my &s;elfe wil put him to death with this my trenchant blade, and ri&s;ing vp againe holding his &s;hield before him with his cimiterre in his hand, he marched towards his enemy, who hauing God on his &s;ide (to whom he recommen|ded him&s;elfe) &s;tood ready to receiue him. Then there began &s;uch a combate betw&eacute;en them that their blowes &s;&eacute;emed two &s;miths for|ging vpon their anuiles, &s;&eacute;eming like fire that the wind kindleth in the aire, and &s;urely the blacke knight had &s;ped but hardly at that time had it not b&eacute;ene for the armour <HI>Vrganda</HI> gaue him, that could not b&eacute;e cut by any weapon, &amp; for the good &s;word hee conque|red in the rocke of the Enchantre&s;&s;e, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ewith hee &s;trooke not one blow, but he drew blood on the Giant <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rerion,</HI> who neuerthe|le&s;&s;e did meruellou&s;ly both defend him&s;elfe and a&s;&s;aile his enemy, but by euil fortune as he thought to &s;trike the knight on the right arme, hee &s;tarted backe, and &s;tepping forwards againe gaue the Giant &s;uch a blow vpon the helmet that hee cut away a great p&eacute;ece thereof together with the buckle that made it fa&s;t, but al|though the blow was maruellous great, and in a manner incre|dible, yet was not the Giant any thing therewith aba&s;hed, but &s;till &s;hewed him&s;elfe as fre&s;h as if hee had not fought all the day long: Neuerthele&s;&s;e the blood in &s;uch aboundance i&s;&s;ued out of his body, that the white pauement of the court was chaunged into red, and therewith he grew &s;o weake, that it might ea&s;ily be iud|ged he had the wor&s;t, whereby he &s;til began to reuile, &s;&eacute;eking on|ly to defend him&s;elfe from his enemies blowes, whereat the old lady that beheld them, con&s;idering her &s;onnes extremity, cried out and &s;aid, alas my child, is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould &s;&eacute;e th&eacute;e murthe|red before my face, and therewith in great ha&s;t &s;hee ran thether, thinking to part them, but it was too late, for as &s;he began to goe towards them, the Giant felde a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the ground with two blows that the black knight gaue him, one vpon the head where he was vnarmed, the other right in the middle of his leg, where with hee cut it from his body, whereat the old lady was &s;o gr&eacute;eued that &s;he
<PB REF="13"> &s;wouned in the place, being by her Gentle women carried from thence into hir chamber, where they laied her on a bed, cur&s;ing him that was the cau&s;e thereof, neuerthele&s;&s;e hee followed them to the chamber dore, where the old woman (being reuiued) per|ceiuing him to enter, began againe to lament and mourne, and &s;hedding great abundance of teares &s;he &s;aid vnto him. Alas thou cruel knight the only bereauer of all my ioy and felicitie, art thou not &s;ati&s;fied yet? But wilt thou like wi&s;e haue my life and my &s;onnes both? Then I pray th&eacute;e with &s;p&eacute;ed either execute thy wil or el&s;e depart from hence, and take what thou thinke&s;t good, per|mitting mee to liue the re&s;t of my mi&s;eraale daies in &s;orrow and care, with the&s;e poor women: but all her intent was to make him enter into the chamber, which was &s;o inchaunted, that no man could pa&s;&s;e the thre&s;hold of the dore, but pre&s;ently hee lo&s;t all his &s;ences and fell downe v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">on the ground, as if hee were dead, but little did the inchauntment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">aile her again&s;t the blacke knight, becau&s;e the &s;hining &s;word had &s;uch a propertie in it, that no en|chantment what&s;oeuer could hurt the bearer thereof. Therefore the knight hearing the &s;orrow the old lady made, hee went into the chamber, &s;peaking courteou&s;ly vnto her &amp; &s;aid, Madame me thinkes you &s;hould take the offence I haue committed on your behalfe in much better part, con&s;idering &s;uch hazards are com|mon vnto knights, de&s;iring to win honour, and therefore I pray you appea&s;e your &s;orrow, and &s;hew mee the knight you brought hether out of great Brittaine. When the old lady perceiued him &s;o farre within the chamber without let, and that he de&s;ired to &s;&eacute;e the king, &s;he being as it were out of her wits, cried as lowd as &s;he could, and &s;aied, alas vnhappy wretch that I am, what haue I done, for thinking to reuenge another mans death, I haue pro|cured the de&s;truction of mine owne children, and therewith &s;hee &s;ighed in &s;uch manner as if her heart would bur&s;t within her bo|dy, and lamenting y^t ab&s;ence of her other &s;on, &s;aid: Alas <HI>Matroco,</HI> where art thou now? What vnhappy fortune hath thus &s;epera|ted th&eacute;e from thy brother and mee? Surely when thou heare&s;t of his death, and at thy returne &s;halt find another lord of this ca&s;tle, I am in doubt thou wilt not haue the patience to put vp &s;o great
<PB REF="13"> an iniury, but thinking to reuenge thy &s;elfe I feare this deuill will handle th&eacute;e in the like &s;ort he hath done the re&s;t, for &s;ure he is no mortall man, for if hee were hee had found more re&s;i&s;tance in this place then he hath done. Then &s;peaking vnto the knight &s;he a&s;ked him if he knew the man &s;he held in pri&s;on, I truly (&s;aied he) it is king <HI>Li&s;uart,</HI> whereof I am right &s;orry, being well a&s;&s;ured that kings elected of God, (as hee is) for the gouernement of his people ought not to be v&s;ed in that manner. Wherefore I would haue you &s;hew me where he is, otherwi&s;e, I will doe wor&s;e then I haue hetherto done. I know not (&s;aid &s;he) who thou art, nor by what meanes thou ha&s;t &s;o great power, but I am well a&s;&s;ured and I would neuer haue thought that twenty &s;uch knights (as once this day I did e&s;t&eacute;eme th&eacute;e) could euer haue attained to the achieuing of &s;o great an enterprice and much le&s;&s;e to haue with|&s;tood my art as thou ha&s;t done, &s;o that con&s;idering thereof, I &s;up|po&s;e that this thy power proc&eacute;edeth from him in who~ in my yong yeares I did once bel&eacute;eue, and &s;ince that haue for&s;aken him, to follow the workes of the common enemie of all mankinde, who according to his naturall in&s;tinction, hath iu&s;tly rewarded me to my de&s;ert: therefore it were but folly to denie th&eacute;e any thing, that art &s;o &s;urely defended by him to whome all thinges are obedient. Follow me then (&s;aid &s;he) and I will &s;hew th&eacute;e the king, but as I thinke, it is not he thou &s;&eacute;eke&s;t. And with that &s;hee ro&s;e vp &amp; went into a darke chamber, the knight following her: then &s;he opened an yron gate and &s;aid vnto him goe in, and there &s;halt thou finde the pri&s;oner. Ladie (&s;aied the knight) if it were to fight I would not faile to doe your commandement, but if by &s;ubtiltie I &s;hould be &s;hut in pri&s;on, you would laugh at me that I had no more wit but to put my tru&s;t in you, wherefore goe you in fir&s;t, that what|&s;oeuer happeneth, you may haue your part, I &s;&eacute;e well (&s;aied the lady) that my labour is in vaine, and all my art is nothing in re|&s;pect of th&eacute;e, therefore I am content to doe thy will, but we haue no light to &s;&eacute;e. Care you not for that (&s;aied he) for I will prouide you light, and with that hee pulled of the taffata that couered the &s;cabberd of his &s;word, whereby there was &s;o great a brightne&s;&s;e in the place, as if the &s;unne had &s;hone therein. Then they de&s;cen|ded
<PB REF="14"> into a caue, where the knight perceiued king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> lie vpon a couch of &s;traw, with a great coller of yron about his necke, and fetters on his legs, whereby he indured no little paine, whereat hee was &s;o gr&eacute;eued, that for &s;orrow the teares ranne downe his eies, yet would hee not di&s;clo&s;e him&s;elfe vnto him, neither once vtter what hee thought, but without making him&s;elfe knowne, &s;aid vnto him. Noble king, you haue beene ouerlong within this filthy place, ri&s;e vp I pray you and follow mee. When the king heard him &s;peake in that manner, h&eacute;e made no other account but to end his daies at that time, wherewith he could not refraine to w&eacute;epe, and &s;peaking vnto the old lady, a&s;ked her if &s;he knew him: For (&s;aied hee) &s;ince I entered into this place, I neuer &s;aw any knight nor any one that &s;pake vnto me, but that little &s;u&s;tenance I had was let downe at a hole from the top of this dungeon.

King (&s;aid &s;he) the &s;hort time of thy continuance in this darknes hath not &s;ati&s;fied (as I well hoped it would) the great mi&s;chief I doe wi&s;h th&eacute;e, and that for good cau&s;e, &s;&eacute;eing that by th&eacute;e onely I

By my &s;oule I &s;weare, that be&s;ides the honour you haue obtained in this place, you haue &s;o much bound me vnto you, that during my life I &s;hall neuer forget your courte&s;ie, wherefore if you loue me let me know your name.

<P>_KIng <HI>Lui&s;art,</HI> the black knight, and the la|dy being entred into the hall, as they loo|ked out at the windowes into the &s;ea, there entered a Gentlewoman, and do|ing reuerence vnto the lady, &s;hee &s;aied, Madame, your &s;onne <HI>Matroco</HI> with his &s;hips is euen now arriued at the foote of the rock, &amp; with him great numbers of other ve&s;&s;els, y^t he hath taken vpon the &s;eas, What is your plea&s;ure to &s;ay vnto him? When the ladie heard her &s;hee waxed pale, and with teares in her eies, an&s;wered her and &s;aid, I would to God he were as farre from hence as hee is n&eacute;ere: for my heart giueth mee he will &s;p&eacute;ed in the like maner that others haue done before him, And as &s;hee &s;pake, king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> and the knight looked into the &s;ea, and perceiuing the Giants fl&eacute;et &s;urging on the &s;hoare out of wind and weather, among the which they knew <HI>Elizabeth Libee</HI> his nephue, and diuers others y^t were bound in chaines, making great &s;orrow, but none of <HI>Matrocos</HI> men dur&s;t &s;et foot on land, hauing already ben aduerti&s;ed by &s;ome of the ca&s;tle, of the great mi&s;fortune happened therein, and for the &s;ame cau&s;e &s;taied &s;o long without, till the Giant e&s;pied at the windowes the knight and y^e king looking vpon them, wherewith in a great rage h&eacute;e cried vnto the blacke knight whom he percei|ued all armed, and &s;aied vnto him: Thou accur&s;ed &s;laue is it thou that &s;o cowardly hath &s;laine my vncle, my brother, and the porter
<PB REF="15"> of my ca&s;tle? When the knight heard him, he an&s;werd him and &s;aid, I haue done my endeuour to make th&eacute;e know, that it belon|geth not to &s;uch as thou art either to impri&s;on kings, or to mole&s;t and gr&eacute;eue &s;o many men as continually thou doe&s;t. By all my gods (&s;aid <HI>Matroco</HI>) fortune fauoureth th&eacute;e too much, when at my arriuall I finde th&eacute;e armed with the wals of this my ca&s;tle, for if I had th&eacute;e here vpon the &s;hore, I would &s;oone &s;end th&eacute;e fi&s;hing in|to the &s;ea as I haue done many other ra&s;h and bold fooles like thy &s;elfe, that ha&s;t enterpri&s;ed without cau&s;e to inforce my ca&s;tle, but if I continue here tenne yeares together, I will neuer depart hence till I haue th&eacute;e in my hands, then &s;halt thou know how I v&s;e to handle &s;uch as thou art. Stay a while (&s;aid y^e black knight) there is much more difference betw&eacute;ene &s;aying and doing, then there is di&s;tance of place betw&eacute;ene th&eacute;e and me. Thy threatnings make me more a&s;&s;ured, wherefore now I feare th&eacute;e le&s;&s;er then I did before, and that thou maie&s;t well know it to bee &s;o, take thy choice whether I &s;hall come downe to fight with th&eacute;e, or thou come vp to me. Then &s;halt thou plainely &s;&eacute;e to whome God will giue the victory, either to th&eacute;e y^t tru&s;te&s;t in thine owne &s;trength, or to mee, that tru&s;t onely in him. The greate&s;t oxen and fatte&s;t buls are oftentimes brought vnto the &s;laughter as well as le&s;&s;er bea&s;ts. So thou great bea&s;t, I adui&s;e th&eacute;e to remember thy for|mer life before wor&s;e happen vnto th&eacute;e, for&s;aking thy accur&s;ed faith which thou now holde&s;t, &amp; with might maintaine&s;t, other|wi&s;e bee thou a&s;&s;ured the wrath of God will fall vpon th&eacute;e, as it hath already done vpon thy friends. That &s;hall bee &s;&eacute;ene (&s;aied <HI>Matroco</HI>) and if thou ha&s;t the courage to &s;tay for mee, I a&s;&s;ure th&eacute;e, thou wilt bee glad to denie the villainous wordes thou now ha&s;t vttered. Therefore cau&s;e the gate to bee opened, for &s;&eacute;eing thou putte&s;t m&eacute;e to my choice, I will come vp to th&eacute;e, were it in|to the dungeon, from whence thou ha&s;t deliuered that villaine &s;tanding by th&eacute;e, and therwith leauing his company behind him, being all armed, he began to mount vp the rocke, and went vnto the ca&s;tle, but when he came to the yron gate, (which he found o|pen, becau&s;e the watch had left it and were gone) and &s;aw <HI>Ar|gantes</HI> lying dead, hee was in a manner out of his wits, not &s;o
<PB REF="16"> much for the prowe&s;&s;e he knew to be in him, as that he had from his youth beene nouri&s;hed and bred vp in the ca&s;tle by the Giant his father. Neuerthele&s;&s;e h&eacute;e di&s;&s;embled his griefe, hoping to bee reuenged at his plea&s;ure, and going further, in another place hee found the Giant armed all in gr&eacute;ene, dead and fre&s;hly bl&eacute;eding, wherewith he was &s;o moued, that he &s;taied and &s;tood &s;till, and ca|&s;ting forth a great &s;igh, began to crie out and &s;aied, alas <HI>Arcalaus</HI> my good vncle, how n&eacute;ere doth the lo&s;&s;e of thee goe to my heart, where&s;oeuer it had happened, but e&s;pecially being done within mine own ca&s;tle, wherein I thought long time to liue and make merry with th&eacute;e: Alas is fortune &s;o cruell vnto th&eacute;e, that after &s;o many trauailes and dangerous aduentures, with infinite perils, that in the flower of thy youth thou ha&s;t &s;u&s;tained, thou mu&s;t in thine old yeares come and receiue &s;o cruell a death within my hou&s;e, which I e&s;t&eacute;emed as an a&s;&s;ured hold and defence, not only for me, but for th&eacute;e and the re&s;t of our kindred and friends? O im|mortall gods, what vengeance can I take vpon the Traitor that hath &s;o much offended me, &s;&eacute;eing that to cau&s;e him to die each day a hundred times were nothing in re&s;pect of the mi&s;chiefe he hath done vnto m&eacute;e? At the lea&s;t if it were <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> &s;o much e&s;t&eacute;emed of all men or any of his two brethren, or all they thr&eacute;e together, my griefe would bee &s;omewhat ea&s;ed by rea&s;on of the &s;orrowes I would cau&s;e them to indure. But what? Now I am con&s;trained to fight again&s;t one alone, who by rea&s;on con&s;idring the trauell hee hath taken all this day, ought already to e&s;t&eacute;eme him&s;elfe ouercome and vanqui&s;hed: What glory then can I ob|taine by winning victory again&s;t him? Trewly as much as if I fought again&s;t a &s;imple woman, being (as by nature &s;hee is) both weake and f&eacute;eble, &s;o hee vnworthy of my pre&s;ence will bee much prowder if I doe but make a countenance to fight with him: ne|uerthele&s;&s;e what blot &s;oeuer may happen vnto mine honour, of force hee mu&s;t die. In this manner did the Giant lament ouer the body of <HI>Arcalaus</HI> his dead vncle, not mouing from thence, till at la&s;t hee perceiued the blacke knight that &s;toode to heare him, wherewith being &s;omewhat a&s;hamed he marched towards him, thinking without hinderance to enter into the dungeon, but hee
<PB REF="16"> found the blacke knight at the gate that boldly thru&s;t him backe, and &s;aied vnto him, Thou bruti&s;h and vnrea&s;onable bea&s;t, thin|ke&s;t thou to enter in by force? Whereat the Giant all aba&s;hed, &s;taied without and &s;aid, Thou bidde&s;t me to come vp, haue I the~ done th&eacute;e wrong to come at thy commandement? No (&s;aied the knight) but beholding thy countenance, it &s;&eacute;emeth thou woulde&s;t enter by authority, and therewith &s;tepping a&s;ide, he &s;aied: Now come in and doe what thou can&s;t. When the old woman (with whom king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> talked) perceiued the~ ready to fight, in great feare &s;he ran out of the hall, and fel downe at her &s;onnes f&eacute;et, cry|ing out and &s;aid, alas <HI>Matroco,</HI> I pray th&eacute;e, and by the duty a child oweth vnto the mother I commaund th&eacute;e not to enter into this combate, for thou knowe&s;t well that of all thy brethren, thou art onely left aliue, wherewith my heart is &s;o gr&eacute;eued, that had it not been for the loue I beare th&eacute;e, thou hadde&s;t found mee now at thy returne in as pittiful e&s;tate as thou &s;&eacute;e&s;t thy brother <HI>Frerion:</HI> nei|ther is there any woman at this pre&s;ent liuing in the world, that ought (with better rea&s;on) to wi&s;h for death then I. Alas what fortune is this, that now again I mu&s;t renue the &s;orrows, which both time and long patience (as I thought) had buried in obliui|uion? Alas mi&s;erable woman that I am, I only haue forged the weapon that hath giuen the wound, whereby at this pre&s;ent I receiue this dommage, for vpon the day of my hu&s;bands decea&s;e, thinking to reuenge the griefe that my &s;oule &s;u&s;tained, I haue to the contrary aduanced mine owne &s;hame and vtter ruine, iu&s;tly receiuing the reward that belongeth vnto &s;uch, as refu&s;ing the better part thinke to remedy one mi&s;chiefe by procuring a wor&s;e vpon them&s;elues. Madame (&s;aid the Giant) if at this pre&s;ent you haue receiued great lo&s;&s;e by the death of &s;ome of your friends, ne|uerthele&s;&s;e you ought not to take it &s;o offen&s;iuely, &s;&eacute;eing they haue ended their daies in honourable combate, as behooueth all worthy knights &s;uch as they were. And as for me, think you that for feare of death I will refu&s;e to doe that whereunto by knight|hood I am bound? No, no: likewi&s;e what rea&s;on or what excu&s;e &s;hould moue me, being as I am both fre&s;h and wel di&s;po&s;ed, to re|fu&s;e the combat alone again&s;t one &s;imple knight? I deny not ma|dame,
<PB REF="17"> but confe&s;&s;e that affection cau&s;eth you to v&s;e the&s;e words, and &s;hew the nature of a woman: but you mu&s;t conceiue &amp; think with your &s;elfe that I an&s;were you as it becommeth me, prefer|ring mine honour before your teares, wherefore I be&s;&eacute;ech you &s;uffer mee to take the &s;mall vengeance I can vpon the villaine that hath &s;o much offended mee. <HI>Matroco</HI> (&s;aied the knight) thou reckone&s;t before thine ho&s;t, I would not for all the gold in the world lo&s;e &s;uch an occa&s;ion offered as I now haue, both for mine honour and aduantage. Bel&eacute;eue mee, that neither thy mothers teares, nor the duty thou owe&s;t vnto her (as being her child) can by any meanes prolong the end of th&eacute;e or me, if without di&s;&s;imu|lation thou doe&s;t not by oath promi&s;e and a&s;&s;ure m&eacute;e to liue in as good &s;ort from this time f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rwards as in times pa&s;t thou ha&s;t liued wickedly. Wherefore it were better for th&eacute;e to make mee know by effect the Prowe&s;&s;e thou vaunte&s;t thy &s;elfe to haue, and for me to let th&eacute;e &s;&eacute;e the curte&s;ie, which it may bee thou &s;halt find at my hands if I ouercome th&eacute;e. When y^e lady perceiued that her pray|ers could take no place &s;he left them, and the two knights began to runne one vpon the other &s;o brauely and with &s;uch fury, that king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> beholding them thought he neuer &s;aw &s;o cruel a bat|tell, &amp; y^e which aba&s;hed him more was, that hee could not pre&s;ume how or in what manner the blacke Knight had found him in &s;o &s;trange a place, and yet he knew him not: &s;ometime hee thought him to be <HI>Amadis,</HI> but when he remembred the loue he bare vnto the lady <HI>Oriana</HI> that hee had newly married, hee was otherwi&s;e per&s;uaded, and likewi&s;e hee remembred very well the combates hee had &s;&eacute;ene <HI>Amadis de Gaule</HI> make at Wind&s;ore again&s;t <HI>Dar|dan le Superbe,</HI> and after that with <HI>Ardan Canile,</HI> wherein hee v&s;ed all his forces, yet were they not comparable to tho&s;e of the blacke knights: who as then found him&s;elfe as fre&s;h and wel di&s;|po&s;ed to fight as if hee had not fought all the day before. Againe when he thought it to be his nephew <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> for that <HI>Vrgan|da</HI> had fore&s;hewed many wonderfull things of him, he was &s;oone di&s;&s;uaded from that opinion by rea&s;on h&eacute;e left him with the qu&eacute;en his mother, not once &s;&eacute;eking to receiue the order of knighthood, and although that &s;ince his departure out of Brittaine he might
<PB REF="17"> haue obtained that honour, yet did hee e&s;t&eacute;eme it impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> to doe &s;o valiantly at the fir&s;t. Further <HI>Vrganda</HI> had alwaies prophe&s;ied of him that the fir&s;t valiant acts he &s;hould at|chieue &s;hould be renowned and &s;poken of by his &s;trange &amp; feare|full nauigation in the great &s;erpent, wherein he &s;hould be imbar|ked, and for the blacke knight he knew he arriued there in a little barke vnfurni&s;hed, whereby he e&s;t&eacute;emed it vnlikely to be his ne|phew <HI>E&s;plandian.</HI> But h&eacute;e thought hee neuer had &s;&eacute;ene &s;o valiant and hardy a knight, for the longer he fought, the more he weari|ed and laboured <HI>Matroco.</HI> Neuerthele&s;&s;e hee continued fighting for the &s;pace of two hours together before it could be iudged who &s;hould haue the victory, but in the end the Giant f&eacute;eling him&s;elfe wounded in &s;o many places (his armour altogether broken, and his &s;hield halfe clouen in two) began to mi&s;tru&s;t his owne force. Wherefore &s;tepping backe he &s;taied his hand, and &s;aied: Knight I pray th&eacute;e&punc; let vs breath our &s;elues a while, and hear what I wil offer th&eacute;e, which cannot bee other then to thy honour and aduan|tage. With that the knight &s;tood &s;till, and <HI>Matroco</HI> began to &s;peake, &s;aying: I wonder (&s;ir knight) what mooued th&eacute;e to ven|ture in this manner vpon this rocke, wherein neuer any but thy &s;elfe dur&s;t enterpri&s;e to come during my fathers life, neither yet &s;ithence that by his death I haue ben lord therof, and be&s;ides this thy enterpri&s;e, wherein thou ha&s;t done the thing that all others feared to doe before th&eacute;e, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t al&s;o &s;laine thr&eacute;e of my friends, whereof two of them as I thinke were the be&s;t knights in their time liuing on the earth, whereby I haue iu&s;t cau&s;e to hate thee more then any man liuing. But when I call to minde that thou ha&s;t done therein like a valiant and hardy knight, I haue &s;ome rea&s;on to pardon th&eacute;e, and to e&s;t&eacute;em thee for one of the valiante&s;t champions that euer I &s;aw in all my life, although I haue both prooued and vanqui&s;hed many others longer practi&s;ed in armes, &amp; &s;tronger then thy &s;elfe. Wherfore if the onely cau&s;e of thy arri|uall in this place was to deliuer the king that looketh on vs, I am content thou take and lead him hence in &s;afety, and for the &s;ame cau&s;e likewi&s;e I quite th&eacute;e of the combate, vpon condition that without long &s;oiourning here, thou &s;halt pre&s;entlie depart out of

Which the blacke knight beholding, for ioy thanked God with all his heart, and taking his &s;word by the point pre&s;ented the handle to <HI>Matroco,</HI> &s;aying vnto him: Truly valiant knight, among &s;o many triumphant victories y^t in times pa&s;t you haue obtained, there neuer happened any one &s;o honou|rable as this, for that herein you haue not onely vanqui&s;hed m&eacute;e, but your &s;elf al&s;o, that for &s;trength of body are inuincible: where|fore as a victorious knight, I pre&s;ent my &s;word vnto you. It &s;hal not be &s;o (&s;aid <HI>Matroco</HI>) but the contrary, for I being vanqui&s;hed &s;ubmit my &s;elfe vnto your plea&s;ure, and from this time forwards di&s;po&s;e of me, my goods and honour, as you &s;hall thinke conueni|ent.

<P>_THe black knight being departed out of the ca&s;tle he had newly conquered, &amp; the pri&s;o|ners entred therein, among the re&s;t king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> knew mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> wherfore he ro&s;e vp (&s;itting by <HI>Arcabonne, Matrocos</HI> mother, who as then leaned on her lap) &amp; went to imbrace him, a&s;king him what fortune had brought him thether at y^t time to &s;aue the Giants life, being in &s;o great extremity? And it plea|&s;eth your grace (&s;aid he) once this day I did not thinke hee would haue had &s;o much n&eacute;ed of my helpe as he now hath: But as I vn|der&s;tand by a knight that I met going downe the hill, hee is in great danger of his life: Neuerthele&s;&s;e for the honour of him that commanded mee to helpe him, I will doe the be&s;t I can.

Then mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> cau&s;ed <HI>Ma|troco</HI> to be &s;oftly laied vpon his bed, and being vnarmed &s;earched his wounds, and perceiuing them to bee deadly, would not for that time doe any thing vnto them but &s;tanch their bl&eacute;eding, lea|uing the re&s;t till hee had &s;lept, wherein hee was newly fallen. In the meane time king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> not forgetting what mai&s;ter <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> at his comming in had &s;aid vnto him, a&s;ked him what was become of the blacke knight: and it plea&s;eth your grace (&s;aied he) as we entred into y^e ca&s;tle, I met him going &s;ecretly from hence, and not minding to returne againe. By Saint <HI>Mary</HI> (&s;aied the king) haue I receiued &s;o great aid at his hands, and am I &s;o vn|fortunate, that hee &s;hould depart from hence without knowing him?

If it be &s;o, if you will do doe me any plea&s;ure, hide it no longer fro~ m&eacute;e, for I neuer had &s;o great de&s;ire to know any knight, not only for the aid he hath done me, but for the vali|ant enterpri&s;e at this pre&s;ent atchieued by him.

Yet fortune not contenting her &s;elfe with this mi&s;chiefe, prepared me a wor&s;e, for my hu&s;band (who for his valour and prowes was feared and redoubted throughout all A&s;ia and Europe) was cru|elly &s;laine by y^e &s;ame murtherer of <HI>Lindoraque,</HI> vpon the &s;ame day

<P>_KIng <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> was not fully a&s;l&eacute;epe, but hee was forced to awake by meanes of a crie of women that hee heard, making great lamentation, wherefore &s;tarting vp, and calling mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and the re&s;t of his company, he tooke a hatchet which he had laied vnder the bol&s;ter of his bed, and went to &s;&eacute;e what it meant, and as he pa&s;&s;ed through the hall,

<HEAD>CHAP. XI How <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> &s;hewed the king what aduentures they had found &s;eeking for <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> their companion, after they had receiued the order of knighthood.</HEAD>
<P>_YOu heard before in what &s;ort king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> was deliuered out of pri&s;on by his nephew <HI>E&s;plan|dian,</HI> but as yet he knew not the manner how he receiued the order of knighthood. Where|fore as they ro&s;e from dinner, the king de&s;i|red him to tell him how he was made knight, as al&s;o what happened vnto him &s;ince that time, to the end (&s;aied h&eacute;e) that <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> may doe the like. Then <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> tolde how <HI>Vrganda</HI> came vnto the Ferme i&s;land in the great &s;erpent, what &s;p&eacute;ech &s;hee had with <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> and others that were with him, the order &s;hee v&s;ed to dub him knight, together with <HI>Talanque, Ambor, Manely,</HI> &amp; the king
<PB REF="31"> of Denmarke: The &s;l&eacute;epe wherein they fell, and that when hee awaked, he found him&s;elfe at the foot of the rocke of the Enchan|tre&s;&s;e, in company of <HI>Sergil</HI> his Squire and two dumb men, al&s;o how he conquered the &s;word, with his arriuall at the mountain, where he found the Hermite, that di&s;&s;uaded him from fighting with the giants. By my head (&s;aid the king) I neuer heard &s;tran|ger things, And now <HI>Ambor</HI> (&s;aied hee) what became of you? My lord (&s;aied <HI>Ambor</HI>) my companion and I were likewi&s;e a&s;l&eacute;epe, and when we awaked we found our &s;elues in a little barke with our two hor&s;es, in a Hauen of the &s;ea called <HI>Armata</HI> in the coun|try of Norway (as then vnknowne to vs) where wee landed be|fore a towne, not only to know in what countrey wee were, but al&s;o to &s;&eacute;eke for victuals. And as wee went towards it, the watch of the towne (by rea&s;on of certain di&s;&s;en&s;ion not long before mo|ued betw&eacute;ene them and their neighbours) &s;ent to knowe what we would haue. Wherewith we made them an&s;were, w&eacute;e were knights aduenturous that came from the Ferme I&s;le, ca&s;t vpon that &s;hore by tempe&s;t of weather. In good truth &s;aid he that &s;pake vnto vs, our king hath &s;o great cau&s;e to v&s;e your helpes, that if you goe vnto him, I am well a&s;&s;ured hee will bid you welcome. We a&s;ked him the kings name, and what country wee were in. My lords (&s;aid he) the country is called Norway, wherof <HI>Adroni</HI> father in lawe to <HI>Agraies,</HI> &s;onne to the king of Scots, and one of the be&s;t knights in the world, is our king, I know not whether you know him. And what cau&s;e &s;aied wee, hath your king to v&s;e our helpe? I will tell you (&s;aid he) he is &s;o old, that one of his ne|phewes, his &s;i&s;ters &s;onne, (procured therevnto by euil coun&s;el) is ri&s;en in armes again&s;t him, &s;&eacute;eking to haue the gouernement of the countrey, in re&s;pect (as hee &s;aith) his vncle is no more able to rule the &s;ame. And vnder that pretence hath already v&s;urped a great part thereof, and now lieth in campe before one of the be&s;t citties in this land, which the king by no meanes can rel&eacute;eue, by rea&s;on that mo&s;t of his tru&s;tie&s;t friends haue for&s;aken him, and hold with the yoong pre&s;umptuous foole, that winneth them by faire promi&s;es, a thing that oftentimes happeneth vnto &s;uch as fortune fauoureth not, and when men are fallen, they are not
<PB REF="31"> only abandoned of &s;traungers, but by their owne kindred and friends, that properly may be tearmed friends for y^e pre&s;ent time. In good faith &s;aid we, if the towne will giue vs victuals, and one to guide vs, we will gladly goe and pre&s;ent our &s;eruice vnto him, not onely for the loue of <HI>Agraies,</HI> to whom wee are companions, but for the right he hath, as you haue told vs. That &s;hall be done (&s;aid he) and therewith de&s;ired vs to &s;tay till he came again from the cittie, where he &s;taied not long, but hee brought what we de|&s;ired, and a guide that conducted vs &s;o wel, that the next day about dinner time we arriued where the king lay. Who being aduerti|&s;ed of our comming, and that w&eacute;e were of <HI>Agraies</HI> companions, entertained vs mo&s;t courteou&s;ly, commaunding one of his Gen|tlemen to vnarme vs in one of his be&s;t chambers, whether hee came, and after hee had bidden vs welcome, beganne in the &s;ame manner to &s;hew vs all what the watch had before declared vnto vs, and what an vnnaturall part his nephew &s;hewed vnto him, procured therevnto by two knights, in whome onely h&eacute;e putteth his whole tru&s;t, becau&s;e (&s;aied hee) they are well a&s;&s;ured, that not any of my knights dareth enter into combat with them, they are e&s;t&eacute;emed &s;o valiant and hardy. But who hath mooued them and your co&s;in (&s;aid we) to vndertake &s;o foule an action? Becau&s;e (&s;aid the king) I haue no i&s;&s;ue male, and my cou&s;in alledgeth I am ouer old to gouerne the countrey, &s;aying, it is fitter for him then for me to do it: but if I can I will hold him from it, and k&eacute;ep it for my doughter <HI>Olinde</HI> and <HI>Agraies</HI> her hu&s;band: By my &s;oule (&s;aid I) I am of this opinion, that &s;&eacute;eing this warre is begun on|ly to trie the title, you both pretend in one thing, It were good your quarrell &s;houle bee ended by the combate of two knights of both parts, without the death and de&s;truction of &s;o many poore innocent people as daily peri&s;h by the &s;ame means, remitting the i&s;&s;ue thereof to tho&s;e whome it &s;hall plea&s;e God to make victori|ous: and if it plea&s;eth you, I and my companion will bee the two knights that &s;hall fight for you. But when h&eacute;e heard mee &s;peake in that manner, hee pau&s;ed a while, &s;&eacute;eming very pen&s;iue, till in the end he an&s;wered me and &s;aied, Sir knights, I am not yet &s;o well acquainted with you, that I &s;hould venture to hazard &s;o
<PB REF="32"> great a kingdome as this is vpon your valour, Neuerthele&s;&s;e, if you will a&s;&s;ure me for a truth that you are knights of the Ferme I&s;land, I am content to &s;tand to it what&s;oeuer may chance. For there can none but valiant knights come from thence, being a&s;|&s;ured (as I &s;uppo&s;e) that otherwi&s;e the lord of the place would not giue them intertainement. Then wee &s;wore vnto him, that what wee had &s;aied was true. Wherevpon hee pre&s;ently di&s;pat|ched a trumpet with me&s;&s;age to his enemy, to offer him the com|bate, who hearing the newes &s;&eacute;emed very glad, making account that his two knights (&s;o much e&s;t&eacute;emed) would ea&s;ily ouercome any two of the be&s;t knights the king had. So that returning the me&s;&s;enger againe, hee &s;ent one of his trumpets with him to con|clude the combate, with the day, time and place where it &s;hould be done, as al&s;o what pledges &s;hould on both &s;ides bee giuen for performance thereof, &s;o that on the day appointed, after ech par|ty had &s;olemnly taken their othes, w&eacute;e entred into y^e li&s;ts, where wee had a cruell and dangerous combate one again&s;t the other, but in the end right lying on our &s;ides, wee wan the victory. And as we would haue &s;triken off their heads, the kings nephew de|&s;ired vs mo&s;t earne&s;tly to graunt him their liues, which wee a|gr&eacute;ed vnto, vpon condition, that from that time forwards hee &s;hould &s;uffer his vncle to raigne in peace, not mole&s;ting him any more, which he promi&s;ed to performe. In this combate we were &s;o wounded, that of force we continued in Norway longer then wee meant to do, where during our abode, certaine marchants arriued in the cittie, that had &s;&eacute;ene (as they told vs) vpon the &s;ea, n&eacute;ere vnto the rocke of the Enchauntre&s;&s;e, a Serpent greater then any ve&s;&s;ell, which &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed them, that they knew not what to doe, whereby we heard newes of <HI>E&s;plandian.</HI> With that (although we were not altogether healed of our wounds) yet we be&s;ought the king to cau&s;e vs to bee conducted thether, which hee willingly graunted, and wee tooke &s;ea, with &s;o good a wind, that within &s;ixe daies after wee approched the rocke where the &s;erpent &s;taied, y^t at the fir&s;t made vs &s;omewhat aba&s;hed, although we had &s;&eacute;ene it oftentimes before. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, we found it fla|&s;hing &s;uch flames of fire out of the mouth and no&s;thrils thereof,
<PB REF="32"> that wee feared the fire would fall into our &s;hippe, whereby not without much paine and trouble, wee procured our mai&s;ter and marriners to approch it, and perceiuing no creature aboord to &s;peake vnto, we began to hallow vnto them with &s;o loud a voice, that at the la&s;t <HI>Sergil</HI> appeared vpon the hatches, and w&eacute;eping, told vs what had happened vnto his mai&s;ter on the rocke of the Enchauntre&s;&s;e, and how after that one of the dumbe men had cau&s;ed him to enter into a little barke, and there with put to &s;ea, &s;o that h&eacute;e knew not if hee were dead or liuing, for hee had heard no newes of him, and there hee &s;taied with another dumbe man in the greate&s;t care that might b&eacute;e. With that wee willed him to call the dumbe man vnto vs, and when hee came, by &s;ignes w&eacute;e made vnto him, we &s;hewed him what plea&s;ure he might doe vs if he would bring vs to y^e place where his fellow had carried <HI>E&s;plan|dian,</HI> which as it &s;&eacute;emed he was content to doe, for pre&s;ently ther|vpon he entered into our ve&s;&s;els and &s;ailed &s;o well, that the tenth day after he &s;et vs on land, hard by the place where wee &s;lew the Giant and the two knights, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;o your grace hath heard what fortunes wee haue pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince wee receiued the order of knight|hood. Truly (&s;aid the king) if tho&s;e of <HI>Manely</HI> &amp; the king of Den|marke be as &s;trange, it may well b&eacute;e &s;aied, there neuer happened the like beginning vnto &s;ixe yong knights.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. How one night as King <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> was in his bed, thinking how hee might returne againe into great Brittaine, hee heard &s;o plea&s;ant a &s;ound of in&s;truments, that hee ro&s;e vp to &s;ee where it might bee: and what happened after that.</HEAD>
<P>_KIng <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> co~tinued &s;o long in the ca&s;tle on the moun|taine, that at the la&s;t hee waxed weary, not &s;o much for the de&s;ire he had to bee in his owne countrey, as for the gr&eacute;efe he certainely knew the Qu&eacute;ene would conceiue, by rea&s;on of his long ab&s;ence: in which kinde of pen&s;iuene&s;&s;e hee continued certaine nights together, that by meanes thereof hee
<PB REF="33"> could take no re&s;t, till at the la&s;t one night among the re&s;t about halfe an hower before day, he heard the &s;w&eacute;ete&s;t mu&s;ick that euer plaied, wherewith hee ro&s;e out of his bed, and without making any noi&s;e opened the window, to heare it better. But as then it was very darke, and the wind blew &s;o hard, that the &s;ea ri&s;ing therewith, beat again&s;t the hollowne&s;&s;e of the rocke, in &s;uch &s;ort that the noi&s;e thereof, and the &s;ound of the mu&s;icke, made a new kind of harmony: wherewith hee was &s;o much delighted, that hee awaked <HI>E&s;plandian, Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque,</HI> that &s;lept &s;oundly, as yoong men without malancholy humours, are accu&s;tomed to doe. But when they heard the mu&s;icke, they &s;taied not long in their beds, but went to the window to &s;&eacute;e who it might bee, but they could &s;&eacute;e nothing till day began to appeare. When they per|ceiued the great Serpent &s;urging on the &s;hoare, wherwith they were exc&eacute;eding glad, making full account that the arriuall ther|of brought them &s;ome good newes: Wherewith they made them ready, and without longer &s;taying, i&s;&s;ued out of the ca&s;tle, to &s;&eacute;e who was in the &s;ame, and as they &s;tood on the &s;hore, they percea|ued a &s;mal boat, and a Gentlewoman comming out of it, bearing in her arms a packet couered with Taffata, who comming vnto the king, with mo&s;t humble reuerence &s;aied vnto him. My lord, and it plea&s;eth your grace, <HI>Vrganda</HI> recommendeth her vnto your maie&s;ty, and hath commanded me to giue you intelligence, that being bu&s;ied to aide the Emperour and the Empre&s;&s;e your doughter, in a certaine thing of great importance, &s;hee hath not had the means to come and vi&s;ite you. Then pre&s;enting y^e packet to <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> &s;aid vnto him, Gentle knight, My mi&s;tre&s;&s;e that lo|ueth and fauoureth you, as it is well knowne, giueth you the&s;e armes, and &s;endeth you word by mee, that as &s;hee gaue you the blacke armes, that hetherto you haue borne (to te&s;tifie thereby the &s;orrow for the lo&s;&s;e of the king, that as then was common a|mong all his true &s;ubiects and friends) So in the&s;e you &s;hal finde the deui&s;e of the lady, that in beautie and comeline&s;&s;e of per&s;on &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all the ladies in the world, as <HI>Amadis</HI> your father in time pa&s;t well proued, when &s;hee &s;et the crowne vpon her head, in remembraunce whereof &s;hee hath euer &s;ithence borne the like
<PB REF="33"> deui&s;e. Who from henceforth &s;hall bee &s;o &s;trongly fixed in your heart, that you &s;hal neuer giue &s;troke with &s;word nor launce, but you will remember her. Which &s;he &s;aid in re&s;pect of the prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> doughter to the Emperour of Con&s;tantinople, that by de&s;tinie was appointed only vnto him. And opening the pack &s;hee pulled out a helmet, &s;hield, Haubert, and a Capari&s;&s;on for a hor&s;e all of white, imbrodered with crowns of gold, and &s;et with Diamonds and Pearles, which h&eacute;e mo&s;t willingly receiued, &s;ay|ing to the Gentlewoman: I pray you in my behalfe giue <HI>Vrgan|da</HI> hearty thankes for the great honour and much good &s;hee hath continually done vnto me, a&s;&s;uring her, that where&s;oeuer I be|come, &s;he hath a knight of mee ready to obay her, and that for the loue of her will beare the&s;e armes as long as it plea&s;eth her. B&eacute;e it &s;o in the name of God (&s;aied &s;he) but before long time bee pa&s;t, you &s;hall haue another mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, that will con&s;traine you to doe greater matters, for &s;h&eacute;e &s;hall raui&s;h both your heart and libertie in &s;uch manner, that you &s;hould loo&s;e ouermuch, if at &s;ometimes you loo&s;e not your &s;elfe for her. And to conclude, I tell you that my mi&s;tre&s;&s;e f&eacute;eleth her &s;elfe as yet &s;o much bound, and beholding to my lord <HI>Amadis</HI> your father, becau&s;e that by his meanes, &s;hee recouered her friend, that during her life &s;he wil v&s;e al the means &s;hee can to doe him pla&s;ure, and you likewi&s;e for his &s;ake. And as &s;hee deliuered y^e me&s;&s;age vnto him, <HI>Carmelle</HI> came thether, and hearing her &s;peake in that manner, an&s;wered her and &s;aid, Gen|tlewoman, I pray you tell your mi&s;tre&s;&s;e from m&eacute;e, that &s;he hath great cau&s;e to recompence them well, by whom &s;he enioieth her friend &s;he loueth &s;o entirely: and tell her I know many, to whom if &s;uch chance &s;hould happen, that would not fail to acknowledge it with the price of their d&eacute;ere&s;t blood, and their &s;oules likewi&s;e if n&eacute;ed were. In faith (&s;aid the gentlewoman) I know not in who&s;e behalfe you &s;peake it, but I know a&s;&s;uredly you touch m&eacute;e at the quick, which &s;he vttered with &s;o good a grace, that the king could not refraine to &s;mile, hauing in times pa&s;t felt the fury of loue, when h&eacute;e fir&s;t &s;aw the Qu&eacute;ene in the country of Denmarke. Yet bee chaunged his countenance, a&s;king the Gentlewoman from whence that mu&s;icke came that hee heard in the morning before
<PB REF="34"> breake of day. My lord (&s;aid &s;he) being &s;ometimes in greater pa&s;|&s;ions then willingly I would, I pa&s;&s;e my melancholy humours with a Lute that I haue, e&s;pecially when I cannot &s;l&eacute;epe, which as I thinke, was it you heard. What company haue you in the Serpent (&s;aid the king?) None (&s;aid &s;he) but <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> Squire, that I found in a manner dead, for the de&s;ire he had to hear news of his mai&s;ter, to whome al&s;o I haue brought the goodlie&s;t white hor&s;e, and the be&s;t harnai&s;ed that euer was &s;&eacute;ene, which my mi|&s;tre&s;&s;e &s;endeth him likewi&s;e. Did &s;he comma~d you to &s;ay nothing el&s;e vnto me (&s;aid the king?) Yes my lord (&s;aied &s;hee) &s;hee &s;endeth you word, that at my arriuall here, you and hee &s;hould enter into this &s;hip, that of it &s;elfe will bring you into great Brittaine, and that the fortunes y^t not long &s;ince happened vnto you, are &s;nares the world &s;etteth to intrap tho&s;e it &s;&eacute;eketh to deceiue, &s;&eacute;eming to ioine gr&eacute;ene and flouri&s;hing age with that which already is dried vp and withered. And further willeth you to put in effect, y^t which in your &s;elfe you haue determined to doe: (which was to for&s;ake his kingly e&s;tate, and liue a &s;olitary life) but hee wondered much that <HI>Vrganda</HI> knew it, yet he made no &s;hew therof, but &s;peaking to the Gentlewoman, he &s;aied. Your mi&s;tre&s;&s;e bindeth mee daily more and more vnto her, being well a&s;&s;ured, that without her helpe I could hardly haue found any to haue brought me into my country. Wherfore I pray you tell her, that what&s;oeuer I haue, is at her commandement, and as touching my determination, which (as &s;oone as I conceiued in my mind, I perceiued it was knowne to her) being at home, if God giueth me life, I meane to put in execution. My lord (&s;aied &s;hee) &s;he praieth you to commend the k&eacute;eping of this ca&s;tle to <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> (not taking a|ny with you but <HI>E&s;plandian, Sergil,</HI> &amp; mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI>) knowing for certaine that hereafter they &s;hall doe &s;uch things, that their renoume will &s;pread throughout the world. Wherewith my lord I will take my leaue, and returne againe to her with the dumbe men, that &s;hall guide me in this little barke. God haue you in his k&eacute;eping (&s;aied the king.) Then the Gentlewoman with her two Marriners entered into the barke that brought <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> the|ther, and &s;etting &s;aile, put to &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. How King <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> imbarked him&s;elfe in the great Serpent, and of the me&s;&s;age <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;ent by <HI>Carmelle,</HI> vnto the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leo|norine,</HI> doughter to the Emperor of Con&s;tantinople.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Gentlewoman that brought the me&s;|&s;age with the two dumbe men, imbarked and put to &s;ea, farre from the rocke: king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> and the re&s;t went vnto the ca&s;tle, where he &s;taied not long, for according to the adui&s;e <HI>Vrganda</HI> had giuen him, hee de|&s;ired <HI>Ambor</HI> &amp; <HI>Talanque</HI> with <HI>Libee</HI> and the re&s;t of the company to k&eacute;ep the ca&s;tle, promi&s;ing with all &s;p&eacute;ed to &s;end them proui&s;ion of all thinges ne|ce&s;&s;ary, whereof they wanted.

My lord (&s;aied &s;hee) I mo&s;t humbly thanke you for the honour it plea|&s;eth you to &s;hew mee, &s;wearing vnto you by the liuing God, that I take no plea&s;ure but in fulfilling your de&s;ire, wherefore I pray you feare not to command m&eacute;e what you thinke good, for what&s;o|euer may happen thereby, I will bee obedient vnto you during my life. My good friend (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) imbracing her, I wil one day recompence your good will, &amp; &s;&eacute;eing you are minded to do me &s;o much fauour, you mu&s;t then take your iourney to Con&s;tanti|nople, on me&s;&s;age to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> the Emperours

Notwith&s;tanding, it hath plea&s;ed her (by mai&s;tee <HI>Eliza|beth</HI>) to put mee in mind thereof, although while breath is in my body I will neuer faile to be her knight.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. How King <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> departed from the Ferme I&s;le, accompanied of diuers knights, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, and being neere Lon|don, in a forre&s;t they met with foure knights, that &s;ent to ask four cour&s;es with their launces again&s;t <HI>E&s;plandian.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THr&eacute;e daies king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> continued in the Ferme I&s;le, and the fourth day hee deter|mined to goe &s;ee the Qu&eacute;ene, and to the &s;ame end, with all y^e company of knights, ladies, and gentlewomen, he &s;et forwards towards London, and trauailed &s;o fa&s;t, that they were within a daies iourney of the cittie. And as they entred into a for|re&s;t, where they v&s;ed commonly to cha&s;e the Hart, they &s;aw in the high way foure knights, well mounted &amp; armed at all points, each his E&s;quire by his &s;ide, bearing their &s;hield and launces, for they had their helmets on their heads. And with that they percei|ued a Gentlewoman comming towards them, riding on a pal|frey, and being n&eacute;ere them, &s;peaking to <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> &s;he &s;aied, Sir knight with the white armes, tho&s;e foure knights you &s;&eacute;e in the high way before you, &s;end you word by me, that they would glad|ly know the cau&s;e why you beare the deui&s;e of crownes, wherin
<PB REF="36"> if you &s;ati&s;fie their de&s;ire, in &s;uch &s;ort that their honours bee not &s;tained, they will from henceforth refraine to inquire the &s;ame any more: otherwi&s;e, they giue you by me to vnder&s;tand, it were be&s;t for you to leaue them, or el&s;e that you defend them well, as being the mo&s;t honourable deui&s;e that is in all the world. When <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> heard her &s;peake in that manner, in courteous &s;ort he an&s;wered her and &s;aid. Gentlewoman, to &s;ati&s;fie their reque&s;t I pray you tell them, that the deui&s;e and the armes I beare was gi|uen me by <HI>Vrganda,</HI> but for what cau&s;e I know not, neuertheles I bear them for the loue of her, as al&s;o that they like me wel: and if this content them not, tel them, mee thinketh the occa&s;ion of combate betw&eacute;ene mee and them is &s;o &s;mall, that for this time I would de&s;ire them to forbeare the &s;ame. In good faith (&s;aied &s;hee) &s;miling, you &s;peak with rea&s;on, for they are knights that &s;&eacute;eme to haue much n&eacute;ed of your coun&s;ell, but notwith&s;tanding good &s;ir, I pray you bee not vnprouided, for your excu&s;es will not bee recei|ued. Gentlewoman (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) if they a&s;&s;aile me, it &s;hall bee again&s;t my wil. Truly (&s;aid &s;he) as farre as I perceiue, the great beautie that is in you, together with the rich armes and goodly hor&s;e you ride vpon are wor&s;e be&s;towed then euer was any, when you are not a&s;hamed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> make an an&s;were &s;o little to your credite.

The way (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) is com|mon to all men, and out of it (for them) I will not goe, wherefore if they a&s;&s;aile me, I mu&s;t of force defend my &s;elf. And becau&s;e the Gentlewoman was not knowne among them, they all mu&s;ed who &s;he might me, as al&s;o who the foure knights were that &s;ent her, to whom &s;h&eacute;e returned againe. Meane time <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> laced on his helmet, taking his launce in his hand, ready to fight if occa&s;ion &s;erued. Wherewith <HI>Amadis</HI> and the re&s;t of the compa|ny were exc&eacute;eding glad, doubting lea&s;t the king had &s;poken in fa|uour of him, when he &s;hewed what he had done, but they had not ridden long, but one of y^e four knights came riding &s;oftly towards them, and about a carriers length from them, called to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and &s;aid, You &s;ir knight that would not &s;ati&s;fie our de&s;ires, defend

Which <HI>Amadis</HI> hearing, &s;ent him his launce, that he willingly receiued, and being in a rage to &s;&eacute;e him&s;elfe a&s;&s;ailed without cau&s;e, h&eacute;e ranne again&s;t the knight, and &s;trake him &s;o &s;urely on the bre&s;t, that he ouerthrew him both hor&s;e and man. Well (&s;aid the king) to the &s;tanders by, iudge you if it be po&s;&s;ible to doe better? My lord (&s;aid <HI>Agraies</HI>) I neuer &s;aw two fairer &s;trokes giuen with a launce, the re&s;t I will leaue to con&s;ider of till I know tho&s;e that ranne again&s;t him. Let vs &s;&eacute;e the end (&s;aied the king) and calling a Squire, hee &s;ent his launce vnto <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> for as then the third knight prepared him&s;elfe to runne, and &s;purring their hor&s;es, &s;et forwards &s;o fiercely, that breaking their launces, they met &s;o &s;trongly, body and &s;hields, and heads together, that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had much adoe to &s;it vpon his hor&s;e, and the other had &s;uch a fall, that he lay &s;til vpon y^e ground. Whereat the fourth knight being aba&s;hed, &s;aied vnto him&s;elfe, Truly, both the king and <HI>Vrgan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ue good rea&s;on (as they do) to a&s;&s;ure the valor and Prowe&s;&s;e of this knight, &s;&eacute;eing it is much more then they warrant it to bee: Neuerthele&s;&s;e, I mu&s;t of force trie him, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould doe both my &s;elfe and him wrong. And with that he called <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and &s;aid, Knight, Although I well know the &s;mall courte&s;ie, that I and my companions haue &s;hewed vnto you, yet I mu&s;t not refu&s;e to doe the &s;ame that they haue done before me, wherefore I pray you &s;end to &s;ome of your company for another launce, that we may &s;&eacute;e who &s;hall beare the honour of this enterpri&s;e.

With that <HI>Gran&s;ador</HI> that heard them &s;peake, gaue him his launce, which he pre&s;ently charging, they met together with &s;uch force, that their launces brake clo&s;e vnto their hands, neither of them remo|uing out his &s;addle, wherefore the knight of the forre&s;t turned to
<PB REF="37"> <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and &s;aied, Sir Knight; let vs yet trie one blow more, and I will quite you for this time. You might content your &s;elfe (&s;aid h&eacute;e) with that is done, but &s;&eacute;eing you are &s;o void of rea&s;on, I am content to trie it with you, till one of vs bee beaten off his hor&s;e. Then he &s;ent <HI>Sergil</HI> to fetch another lance, and he brought him one &s;ome what bigger and &s;horter then tho&s;e hee had before, wherewith hee &s;trooke the knight of the forre&s;t &s;o valiantly, that he ouerthrew him, him&s;elf being con&s;trained to imbrace his hor&s;e about the necke, or el&s;e he had fallen as the other did that lay on the ground, yet he ro&s;e before <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had runne out his cour&s;e and as he returned barke, he &s;taied him by the armour and &s;aied vnto him, Before God &s;ir knight, you haue &s;ufficiently &s;hewed that in valour and Prowe&s;&s;e you are &s;econd to none but to your &s;elfe: but hee an&s;wered not a word, but holding downe his head (a&s;hamed of that had happened vnto him) pa&s;&s;ed forth. With that the king came thether to knowe what knights they were that had ben ouerthrowne, among the which he knew <HI>Galaor,</HI> for hee had put off his helmet to do him honour when he &s;aw him come, wherat the king was &s;o well plea&s;ed, that he alighted of his hor&s;e and ranne to imbrace him, the like did <HI>Amadis,</HI> &s;aying vnto him, with a &s;miling countenaunce, How now brother <HI>Galaor,</HI> how long haue you v&s;ed to be a k&eacute;eper of the high waies? You &s;&eacute;e (&s;aid hee) that I and my companions haue &s;ought to trie whether this knight be of &s;uch force as we haue found him, and what hath hap|pened you may well iudge, when <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> vnder&s;tood his vn|cle <HI>Galaor</HI> (fearing to haue offended) hee lighted off his hor&s;e, and kn&eacute;eling downe before him, a&s;ked pardon for his fault. Nephew (&s;aied h&eacute;e) it is I that haue done the wrong, and therefore I tolde the king that you are a better knight then I, and maruaile not if I &s;ought to prooue it, Becau&s;e I thought to doe it with mine ho|nour, but I found the contrary, which from henceforth &s;hal make me thinke the things fore&s;hewed of you will bee accompli&s;hed &s;o well, that the glory of your father, and the reputation by many knights in times pa&s;t obtained, &s;hall from henceforth bee extin|gui&s;hed, you hauing &s;o ea&s;ily ouerthrowne thr&eacute;e of y^e be&s;t knights in great Brittaine, and my &s;elfe the fourth. What are they (&s;aid
<PB REF="37"> the king?) My lord (&s;aid <HI>Galaor</HI>) the fir&s;t that ranne was <HI>Sendale</HI> of <HI>Gona&s;te,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Galuanes,</HI> the third <HI>Angriote d'e&s;trauaulx,</HI> and my &s;elfe hath done wor&s;e then they. Wherat the king and al the company began to laugh: And imbracing them, cau&s;ed them to mount on hor&s;ebacke, riding towards London, where in the way the King praied them to tell him howe this enterpri&s;e was deui&s;ed. My Lord (&s;aied <HI>Galaor</HI>) hauing vnder&s;toode by the dani&s;h Gentlewoman (that my lady <HI>Oriane</HI> not long &s;ince &s;ent vnto the Qu&eacute;ene, to bring her newes of your returne, and what had hap|pened vnto you during your impri&s;onment) the valiant acts by you declared of my nephew <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> wee conceiued &s;uch a iea|lou&s;ie again&s;t him, e&s;t&eacute;eming the honour you did him thereby, to proc&eacute;ed rather of fatherly loue then otherwi&s;e, that w&eacute;e determi|mined &s;ecretly to depart out of London to proue his force, as now you haue well &s;&eacute;ene: and to moue him therevnto, we &s;ent the gen|tlewoman with the me&s;&s;age you haue heard. Of my faith (&s;aied the king) the deui&s;e was good, and hath fallen out well. In this manner deui&s;ing of &s;undry things, hee came to Mirefleur, where the Qu&eacute;en met him, prai&s;ing God for his vnexpected return, and con&s;idering his trouble pa&s;t, with the gr&eacute;efe &s;hee had for his long ab&s;ence, &s;&eacute;eing him there &s;afe and in good health, &s;hee thought her &s;elfe well recompenced with his pre&s;ence. The next day in the morning they &s;et forwards towards London, where the people receiued him with &s;uch &s;igns of gladne&s;&s;e, that mo&s;t part of them wept for ioy to &s;&eacute;e him, for there was neuer Prince better loued of his &s;ubiects the~ he. Being there, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> began to be weary of the place, longing to heare news of <HI>Carmelle,</HI> that he had &s;ent to Con&s;tantinople, as you haue heard before. And therefore eue|ry day hee deui&s;ed meanes to get licence to depart from thence, pretending a cau&s;e of returning to the ca&s;tle called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> &s;hewing the king what promi&s;e he had made to his com|panions, which if hee did not performe, they &s;hould haue cau&s;e to complaine of him, but the king would not in any &s;ort graunt to his reque&s;t, yet in the end, ouercome with much importunity, he was content, wherewith hee tooke his leaue of all the court, and vpon a monday in the morning taking hor&s;e, accompanied onely
<PB REF="38"> of mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>Sergil</HI> his &s;quire, hee tooke his way to|wards the Ferme I&s;le, hoping to finde the great Serpent there, wherein they might imbarke them&s;elues.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. How <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> riding towards the Ferme I&s;le, was a&s;&s;ailed by a &s;trange knight that watched him in the forre&s;t.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_ESplandian</HI> departed from the king, and hauing taken his leaue of all the court, as you heard before, tooke the crooked|de&s;t way hee could, through woods and forre&s;ts towards the Ferme I&s;ie, thin|king not to bee perceiued of any, that might hinder his enterpri&s;e. And ha|uing ridden thr&eacute;e miles, he entered in|to a forre&s;t, which hauing almo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ed, h&eacute;e came vnto a great riuer&punc; wherevpon the king had built a hou&s;e, called Bellero&s;e, where oftentimes being on hunting, hee v&s;ed to re&s;ort. And as he thought to pa&s;&s;e the bridge, he perceiued on the other &s;ide a knight armed at all points ready to fight, that cried vnto him with a loud voice, and &s;aid: Sir knight, you mu&s;t a&s;ke me leaue if you wil come ouer, for according to my promi&s;e, I haue taken vpon mee to k&eacute;epe this bridge, for the &s;pace of one whole yeare, wherefore if you thinke good, you may take &s;ome other way. With that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was much gr&eacute;eued, perceiuing that either of force he mu&s;t fight, or &s;&eacute;eke another pa&s;&s;age, wher|fore he would willingly haue excu&s;ed him&s;elfe, &amp; &s;aid: Sir knight, I pray you then &s;hew mee which way I were be&s;t to goe, for by me you &s;hall haue no cau&s;e at this time to trouble your &s;elfe. You mu&s;t returne again to London (&s;aid he) for other pa&s;&s;age is there none, vnle&s;&s;e you will loo&s;e your hor&s;e and goe on foot. Rather the I would doe &s;o (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) I will proue if I can win yours, and therewith lacing his helmet, tooke his launce and road vnto the knight, who no &s;ooner perceiued him comming, but &s;etting
<PB REF="38"> &s;purres to his hor&s;e, ranne towards him, whereby they met &s;o fiercely together, that both y^e knights fell off their hor&s;es, in &s;uch manner, that mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Sergil,</HI> thought verily they had &s;laine each other, but they &s;taied not long before they ro&s;e a|gaine, and laying hand on their &s;wordes, there began betw&eacute;ene them the cruelle&s;t and mo&s;t daungerous battell that euer was &s;&eacute;ene: whereat mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> much aba&s;hed, &s;aid vnto him|&s;elfe, Good God, what may this meane, I bel&eacute;eue for certain that &s;ome diuell of hell hath tran&s;formed him&s;elfe into humane &s;hape, to de&s;troy vs all. Meane time the two knights continued in mo&s;t cruell fight, &s;till increa&s;ing their mights, cleauing &s;hields and ar|mours, in &s;uch &s;ort, that all the field was couered with p&eacute;eces of the harneis, and died with blood that i&s;&s;ued from their bodies, till at the la&s;t the knight of the bridge &s;tept backe &amp; &s;aid vnto <HI>E&s;plan|dian,</HI> Sir knight, take another way, and I am content to quite you of the combate, for you are the valiante&s;t knight that euer I dealt withall, and it &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e mee much, if by your wilful|ne&s;&s;e you would be cau&s;e of your owne death. In good faith (&s;aied he) I had done it at the fir&s;t, had it not beene, the feare I had, that you would e&s;t&eacute;eme me a coward, but knowing very wel that the honour of this combate cannot bee had, but onely by the death of one of vs, or both together, I will trie my fortune, till I bee no longer able to weld a &s;word. Is that true (&s;aid the knight?) Then let vs &s;&eacute;e to whom fortune will be fauourable. And therewith co|uering them&s;elues with that little of their &s;hields that re&s;ted in their hands, they began the combate crueller then before, as though all the day they had not giuen a &s;troke, &s;o that after many cruel blowes with their &s;words, they clo&s;ed together, and wra&s;t|ling long time, they &s;ought to ca&s;t each other to the ground. But &s;&eacute;eing the little aduantage gotten thereby, they began againe to lay on with their &s;words with &s;uch fury, that <HI>Sergil</HI> looked for no other but when they &s;hould fall dead vpon the ground, not b&eacute;eing able to iudge who would haue the victory. Whereat mai&s;ter <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI> was &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed, that hee could not ab&s;taine from w&eacute;eping, &s;aying vnto him&s;elfe, Alas what fortune is this, mu&s;t the be&s;t knight liuing in the world, and in the flower of his age
<PB REF="39"> lo&s;e his life at that time by &s;o hard a chaunce? Cur&s;ed be the day that euer he met with him, that is the cau&s;e of &s;o great lo&s;&s;e. And to &s;ay truth, if God had not prouided for them, the father had &s;lain the &s;onne, and the &s;onne the father, for the knight of the bridge was <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> who being ouer curious of his &s;onnes glo|ry would proue his force, and the better to doe it, the day before <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> tooke his leaue, hee departed &s;ecretly from the court, and &s;taied for him at the bridge, bearing an vnknowne armour, where after many attempts on either part giuen, <HI>Amadis</HI> per|ceiuing both their dangers, &s;aid vnto <HI>E&s;plandian:</HI> Knight, you &s;&eacute;e well you cannot ouercome mee, and I a&s;&s;ure you, I neuer had to doe with any knight, that euer put mee to &s;o great extreamity, wherefore I am content to let you pa&s;&s;e. But not I you (&s;aied he) vnle&s;&s;e you tell me your name. I will not deny you that (&s;aied <HI>Amadis</HI>) wherefore cau&s;e mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to come hether, for I thinke we haue both n&eacute;ed of his helpe. Then <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> called him vnto them, meane time <HI>Amadis</HI> put off his helmet, &s;o faint and weary, that h&eacute;e was con&s;trained to leane vnto a tr&eacute;e. But when <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> knew him and perceiuing the fault he had com|mitted, he ca&s;t forth a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> crie, and &s;aied: Alas wicked wretch that I am, and therewith he fell vpon the ground, whereat mai|&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Amadis</HI> thinking him to bee in a &s;ound, ranne to lift him vp, but it was not &s;o, onely that it gr&eacute;eued him h&eacute;e had dealt in &s;uch manner with his father, who &s;aid vnto him, &s;onne, although I am as &s;ore wounded as po&s;&s;ible may bee, without death, yet haue I not receiued &s;o much hurt, as conceiued plea|&s;ure, perceiuing the valour I find to be in you, wherefore bee not di&s;comforted. Notwith&s;tanding he could not content him&s;elfe, but cur&s;ed his owne life, being (as he &s;aid) the mo&s;t vnhappy man that euer was borne of woman. And continuing in that gr&eacute;efe, y^e blood in diuers places ranne out of his body, whereby he waxed faint, which mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> perceiuing, and knowing a&s;&s;uredly, if remedy were not &s;p&eacute;edily had, they were both in danger of their liues, hee &s;aied vnto them: I pray you for this time leaue off your &s;orrow, and let vs pre&s;ently go to Mirefleur, not far from hence, for you both haue greater n&eacute;ede of re&s;t, then of longer &s;taying in
<PB REF="39"> this place, wherewith he and <HI>Sergil</HI> &s;et them on their hor&s;es, and with great pain brought them to the ca&s;tle, where their wounds were dre&s;&s;ed. Such was the combate betw&eacute;ene the two knights as you haue heard, yet &s;ome write, that <HI>Amadis</HI> was &s;o wounded by <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> that in the end with a thru&s;t of a launce into the right &s;houlder, and other blowes with his &s;word, hee was &s;laine in the field, which <HI>Oriane</HI> hearing, threw her &s;elfe out of a win|dow, and brake her necke. But it is not true, for they raigned af|ter that both in Fraunce and great Brittaine, and had another &s;onne named <HI>Perion,</HI> and a doughter no le&s;&s;e beautifull then her mother, that married <HI>Arqui&s;il</HI> &s;onne to the Emperour of Rome. But I cannot conceiue from whence tho&s;e lyers could inuent &s;uch a thing, if they vnder&s;tand not by (death) the &s;hadowes that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> cau&s;ed his fathers valiant acts to bee couered withall, by the light and plea&s;ant &s;hining of his owne, wherby his fathers were &s;o much had in obliuion, that there was no more brute of them, then if they had neuer beene done. But to returne againe vnto our matter, you mu&s;t note that newes went pre&s;ently vnto the court, what had chanced to the two knights. Wherewith the king and <HI>Oriane</HI> much di&s;plea&s;ed, departed from London, &amp; came to Mirefleur, when mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> began the &s;econd time to dre&s;&s;e their wounds. Whereby he perceiued them out of danger, and cured them &s;o well, that within &s;euen daies after they could walke about the chamber, which put <HI>Oriane</HI> in better comfort then before, and it fell out well for her, for if her malancholy had longer indured &s;he had for certain died at that time. And becau&s;e the king had not as yet vnder&s;toode the rea&s;on that mooued them to fight, one day when hee found <HI>Amadis</HI> in good di&s;po&s;ition, hee praied him to tell him.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. How the King of Denmarke, <HI>Garinter,</HI> and <HI>Manely,</HI> &s;uccoured <HI>Vr|ganda,</HI> that certaine knights would haue &s;laine, becau&s;e &s;he aided the Emperors &s;onne of Rome.</HEAD>
<P>_YOu heard before of the aduentures of <HI>E&s;plandi|an, Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque,</HI> after they had recei|ued the order of knighthood, now you &s;hall heare what became of <HI>Garinter</HI> king of Den|marke, and <HI>Manely,</HI> who &s;l&eacute;eping as others did by the &s;ound of &s;ixe trumpets that plaied on the &s;hore, the next night they found them|&s;elues with their &s;quires in a little barke, &s;o farre out of al know|ledge, that although they had landed they knew not where they were, and it was &s;o darke, that they could not &s;&eacute;e each other, till at the la&s;t they perceiued a fire not farre from thence, that moued them to goe thether, to &s;&eacute;e if they could find any that would &s;hew them in what country they were, therefore leauing their &s;quires to k&eacute;epe their barke, they tooke their &s;hields, and mounting vp a little hill, they perceiued a fire burning circle wi&s;e, in the middle whereof they &s;aw a woman holding a yong child in her armes, and about the fire &s;tood tenne knights all armed, that &s;ought to take her, but by no meanes they could come n&eacute;ere her, &s;he was &s;o well defended by the fire. And as they went n&eacute;erer vnto it, they heard one among the re&s;t that &s;aid vnto her, Ha, thou fal&s;e and accur&s;ed wretch, thy diuelli&s;h &s;pirits and familiars can now no longer helpe th&eacute;e, but at this time thou &s;halt &s;urely die. And al|though <HI>Manely</HI> and <HI>Garinter</HI> had their helmets on their heads,
<PB REF="40"> yet the woman they &s;o threatened, knew them well, calling the~ and &s;aid: Help me my &s;onnes, and faile me not I pray you at this time. With that <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke knew her by her voice, wherefore laying hands on their &s;words, they mar|ched towards the tenne knights, wherof one of them &s;tepped be|fore the re&s;t, a&s;king them if they knew that wicked woman that had done him the greate&s;t mi&s;chiefe that euer was. By God &s;ir knight (&s;aid <HI>Manely</HI>) you lie in your throat, &s;he is not wicked, but faithfuller for her part, then you for yours. Wherewith they ran each vpon other, and there began the combate of tenne knights again&s;t two, and although the match was not equall, <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke &s;etting their backes together, laied valiantly vpon them, yet in the end they could not haue re&s;i&s;ted, but <HI>Vrganda</HI> playing her part, put out the fire, and taking her two knights a&s;ide, left the re&s;t in the darke, &s;triking each other as if <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke had beene with them. Meane time <HI>Vrganda</HI> and her company got into the thicket of the wood, and hauing trauailed long, at the la&s;t the moone began to &s;hine, when they were weary, whereby they determined to &s;tay a while and re&s;t them&s;elues till day appeared. Meane time the two knights de&s;ired <HI>Vrganda</HI> to &s;hewe them how &s;hee came thether, and whether &s;he knew the country. My good friends (&s;aid &s;he) hauing long &s;ince learned by my art, that this little child &s;on to the Emperour of Rome, and of the Empre&s;&s;e <HI>Leonor</HI> his wife, &s;hould bee &s;tollen away by the Traitor that a&s;&s;ailed you, who is &s;onne to <HI>Garadan,</HI> that <HI>Amadis</HI> (as then called the knight of the gr&eacute;ene &s;word) put to death in the countrey of Bohemia, in defen|ding the right of king <HI>Tafmor:</HI> As &s;oone as you fell on &s;l&eacute;epe in the great Serpent, I made al the ha&s;t I could vnto this place to &s;uc|cour it, according to my promi&s;e made (being in the Ferme I&s;le) in pre&s;ence of <HI>Amadis</HI> and diuers other knights, where I arri|ued at &s;o good a time when the villaines which you &s;aw, came to a &s;hepheards hou&s;e, where a poore nur&s;e dwelt, to whom they de|liuered this little child to giue it &s;ucke. And &s;&eacute;eing it was time to put my enterpri&s;e in practi&s;e, I went out of my barke, and ma|king as if I had ben robbed by certaine th&eacute;eues, ranne towards
<PB REF="41"> them, crying out and w&eacute;eping bitterly, wherewith they all came forth to &s;&eacute;e what it might be, and perceiuing me in that manner, a&s;ked the cau&s;e of my gr&eacute;efe. Ha my lords (&s;aid I) It is &s;o, that as my hu&s;band &amp; I pa&s;&s;ed through this wood, w&eacute;e met eight th&eacute;eues, that &s;lew him, and not content therewith, haue taken away my hor&s;e and my budget, wherein there is a great &s;umme of money. Which they bel&eacute;euing to bee true, (not that they were mooued with compa&s;&s;ion for my lo&s;&s;e) but re&s;pecting their owne particu|lar benefite, hoping to get a booty by them that had robbed mee, &s;cattered them&s;elues in companies to find them out, where they &s;taied &s;o long, that the &s;h&eacute;epheard and his wife went out of the hou&s;e, and thinking to haue their parts, left mee alone with the child, that not long after I tooke in mine armes, and went away. But as it fell out, the nur&s;e came in, and mi&s;&s;ing the child, called to them for help, who running in great ha&s;t, followed m&eacute;e &s;o fa&s;t, (that had it not ben for night that ouertooke them) and the great fire you found about mee, I had neuer e&s;caped their hands. And what would they haue done with this poore infant (&s;aid <HI>Manely?</HI>) You &s;hall vnder&s;tand (&s;aid &s;he) that the &s;onne of <HI>Garadan</HI> hauing conceiued a mortal hatred again&s;t the Emperour, either becau&s;e he could not haue the entertainement hee thought hee had de&s;er|ued, or el&s;e gr&eacute;eued (as I thinke) that hee could not attaine vnto the Empire, as hee pretended: determined not onely to reuenge him&s;elfe vpon this little child, but to kill the Emperour likewi&s;e if euer he haue the means. By God (&s;aid the king of Denmark) h&eacute;e is a wicked and cruell hearted man, but a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe that God wil not permit it to be &s;o. Neuerthele&s;&s;e I am in doubt this child will indure much woe, &s;&eacute;eing you haue no meanes to giue it &s;ucke. Let me alone with that (&s;aid <HI>Vrganda</HI>) for I haue certain hearbes about me, with the iuice wherof I will nouri&s;h it, if n&eacute;ed be eight daies together. What (&s;aied hee) will you then &s;tay here &s;o long? No (&s;aid <HI>Vrganda</HI>) for as &s;oone as it is day I will returne vnto my boat that &s;taieth here at the &s;hoare. But madame (&s;aied they) what &s;hal become of vs? for we are arriued here, not know|ing who brought vs hether. But for Gods &s;ake, if you haue heard any newes of our companions, let vs knew it, and where wee

And in that manner &s;ometimes talking and &s;ometimes &s;l&eacute;eping, they pa&s;&s;ed the time away till day began to appeare, when they thr&eacute;e together went to the &s;ea &s;ide, where they entered into <HI>Vrgandas</HI> boat, wherein foure Gentlewomen and two dwarfes &s;taied for her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. How Vrganda departed from the two knights, and being guarded by two dragons went vnto the Emperours court, to deliuer them their yoong &s;onne, for the lo&s;&s;e whereof all the court was in an vprore.</HEAD>
<P>_FOr a time <HI>Vrganda</HI> &s;taied with the two knights, not minding pre&s;ently to ea&s;e the Emperours mind with the recouery of his &s;onne, in the end &s;he cau&s;ed them to returne vnto their barke, wil|ling them from that time forwards to arm them|&s;elues again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of fortune, although &s;he &s;&eacute;emed neuer &s;o variable and vncon&s;tant. For (&s;aid &s;h&eacute;e) there|fore was y^e order of knighthood in&s;tituted &amp; appointed, that there|by it might appeare more excellent. And they were no &s;ooner de|parted, but &s;he &s;et foot on land, and mounted on a palfrey with the child in her lappe, &s;hee rude forward, with two dragons to guard her, one vpon her right hand, the other vpon the left, that bare her company till &s;h&eacute;e came to Triol, where the Emperour helde his court. And approching the Towne, &s;he met great companies of knights that went to &s;&eacute;eke the child, who &s;&eacute;eing tho&s;e horrible bea&s;ts ca&s;ting fire out of their mouths, for feare they began to flie, whereat <HI>Vrganda</HI> &s;miled. At the la&s;t <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> king of Sar|dinia comming that way, (hauing ridden a great compa&s;&s;e about to pur&s;ue <HI>Garadans</HI> &s;onne) and returning as then all weary &amp; &s;ore trauailed with his hor&s;e tyred, perceiuing the people to runne &s;o fa&s;t, a&s;ked them the cau&s;e, wherewith they &s;hewed him a farre
<PB REF="42"> off what they had &s;&eacute;ene, but hee not aba&s;hed, went towards the dragons, thinking if it were po&s;&s;ible to fight with them, and as he came n&eacute;erer vnto them, he knew <HI>Vrganda,</HI> and &s;purring his hor&s;e, hee thought to &s;alute her, but the more hee prickt him for|wards, the more the hor&s;e gaue backe, whereby he was con&s;trai|ned to light downe, and &s;aluting her, he tooke her by the hand, but the dragons vani&s;hed away, whereat hee was aba&s;hed, which <HI>Vrganda</HI> perceiuing, &s;aid vnto him: In faith &s;ir knight, they haue good cau&s;e to giue you place, knowing well the magnanimitie of your inuincible courage. And for my part, I e&s;t&eacute;eme my &s;elfe bet|ter guarded (being in your company) then I did before, wherfore I pray you leaue me not, till I haue deliuered this child vnto his mother, which I haue recouered from the villaines that had &s;tol|len it from her. Is it po&s;&s;ible madame (&s;aid <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI>) that the em|perour &s;hould receiue &s;o great a plea&s;ure by your means? Shew mee.

With that they rode together till they came to the Emperours court, where they found the Empre&s;&s;e halfe dead for &s;orrow, but when &s;hee heard the good newes <HI>Vrganda</HI> brought, her &s;orrow turned to exc&eacute;eding ioy. And for that the em|perour being armed, was ridden out to &s;&eacute;eke the child, as others did, &s;hee &s;ent men on all &s;ides to certefie him thereof, hee hauing intelligence, thanked God with all his heart, and turned backe to &s;&eacute;e <HI>Vrganda,</HI> that told him in what manner &s;he found the child, as you haue heard before.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Of the &s;trange aduentures that the king of Denmarke and Manely had, after they departed from Vrganda, and what pa&s;time they had with two great apes in an I&s;land, where by chaunce they ar|riued.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter the king of Denmarke and <HI>Manely</HI> departed from <HI>Vrganda,</HI> they entered in|to their barke, where their two Squires &s;taied for them, and &s;o imbarked, pre&s;ent|ly hoi&s;ed &s;aile and put to &s;ea, the weather very peaceable and calme: but they had not &s;ailed long, when a contrary winde began to ri&s;e, wherewith y^e waters grew &s;o high, and the &s;ea began to &s;well &s;o bigge, that one while it &s;&eacute;e|med to mount vnto the &s;kies, and againe to de&s;cend as low as the bottomele&s;&s;e pit of hel, whereby their little barke, was often|times couered with water, hauing neither ma&s;te, &s;aile, nor ca|ble, but all rent in p&eacute;eces. And that which aba&s;hed the~ mo&s;t was, that night comming vpon them, it was &s;o darke, they could not &s;&eacute;e the length of their boat, in which torment they continued for the &s;pace of thirty daies together, till at the length it ca&s;t them vpon an I&s;land, where (being arriued about &s;unne &s;etting) they landed. Then commaunding one of their &s;quires to k&eacute;epe their boat, being armed at all points, they went into the I&s;land to &s;&eacute;e if they could find any fre&s;h water or other victuals, for they had not &s;ufficient in their barke to &s;erue them for a w&eacute;eke, at the la&s;t they found a goodly fountaine, &s;hadowed with many great tr&eacute;es, whereby they &s;at them downe, and putting off their helmets for to drinke, <HI>Argenton</HI> their &s;quire that was with them, &s;aied vnto them: if you thinke good, gou &s;hall &s;tay here while I goe vp this high rocke, where (it may be) I &s;hal find a hou&s;e, or &s;ome country man that will &s;hew vs in what place we are arriued? Goe (&s;aied the king of Denmarke) but take h&eacute;ede thou loo&s;e&s;t not thy &s;elfe.
<PB REF="43"> With that the &s;quire left them, and tooke his way through the wood, but he had not gone a long bowes &s;hot, when he perceaued a great Beare comming towards him, wherewith hee was in &s;uch feare, that with a lowd voice he cried out for helpe, and fin|ding no other remedy, hee was con&s;trained to climbe into a high tr&eacute;e. The knights hearing their &s;quires crie, &s;uppo&s;ed he had n&eacute;ed of them, and with that they ranne in &s;uch ha&s;t to helpe him, that forgetting their helmets behind them, left them by the fountain, and they had not runne farre, but they e&s;pied the Bear climbing again&s;t the tr&eacute;e, wherein the Squire was defending him&s;elfe as well as he could, but the bea&s;t for&s;aking her fir&s;t pray, ranne vn|to <HI>Manely,</HI> being next vnto her, thinking at the fir&s;t encounter to throw him on the ground, but he &s;tepping a&s;ide, gaue her &s;uch a blow with his &s;word, that therewith he cut off one of her eares with a p&eacute;ece of her iaw, but the Beare turned again, and taking him mo&s;t fiercely about the body thought to &s;trangle him, wher|with he had almo&s;t lo&s;t his breath, when the king of Denmarke came vnto her, and with one blow cut one of her legs clean from the body, whereby the bea&s;t in great angui&s;h for&s;aking her pray, fled into the thicket of the wood, and the king after her, and lon|ger had followed, had it not ben for the waight of his armor, that wearied him ouermuch, wherefore returning againe vnto his companion, they two help their Squire <HI>Argenton</HI> to come down the tr&eacute;e, who as yet for feare trembled like a leafe, whereat they both began to laugh, <HI>Manely</HI> a&s;king him if he were a cold, no (&s;aid he) but I was in the greate&s;t feare that euer I had in all my life, or euer I hope &s;hall haue againe, and &s;urely I bel&eacute;eue there are no other people in this I&s;land, then diuels di&s;gui&s;ed in &s;traunge formes, or el&s;e &s;uch proper Gentlewomen, as &s;he that of late im|braced you &s;o courteou&s;ly, wherefore I am of this opinion, that for our better &s;ecurity, it were be&s;t for vs to &s;tay by the fountain, or in our barke till the &s;ea bee &s;omewhat pacefied. In truth thou &s;aie&s;t well (&s;aied the king of Denmarke) but in the meane time bee thou of a good courage and feare nothing, I knowe not what courage I &s;hould haue (&s;aied he) but I pray you for Gods &s;ake let vs be gone, vnle&s;&s;e you will &s;&eacute;e me die here. As farre as I &s;&eacute;e (&s;aid
<PB REF="43"> <HI>Manely</HI>) thou wilt neuer die in fight, as long as thou finde&s;t meanes to runne away. Not if I may (&s;aied <HI>Argenton</HI>) for if I &s;hould, it were done but like a foole. In which manner talking together, they came vnto the fountaine, where they e&s;pied two old apes ca&s;ting their helmets (they had left behind them) one at the other, as lightly as if they had been at Tenni&s;e, whereat the two knights and <HI>Argenton</HI> laughed &s;o hartely, that they were al|mo&s;t ouercome with laughter: for the apes had no &s;ooner &s;pied them comming, but in great ha&s;t they put the helmets on their heads, and climbing vp the tr&eacute;es, &s;kipped from branch to branch, &s;ometimes vp and &s;ometimes down, like two tumblers. As God helpe me (&s;aid <HI>Manely</HI>) I like the&s;e apes well, for they knew w&eacute;e were &s;o melancholy on the &s;ea, that they meant to make vs mer|ry on land, yet I tru&s;t they &s;hall not carry away my arms with|out a combate. Wherewith they tooke vp &s;tones and threw at them, but they turning about, grinned with their t&eacute;eth, making mouths and mowes, &s;ometimes &s;cratching their ar&s;es. Where|with the king of Denmarke tooke &s;uch plea&s;ure, that hee de&s;ired <HI>Manely</HI> and <HI>Argenton</HI> to let the apes alone, and as then it began to be night. Wherefore they &s;ent their &s;quire to fetch his compa|nion, with the re&s;t of the victuals they had in their barke, becau&s;e the &s;ea ro&s;e &s;o high, that they doubted their barke would bee ca&s;t on &s;hoare, and breake in p&eacute;eces, who &s;taied not long before they came againe, and after the knights had eaten of &s;uch victuals as they had, they put off their armour, and &s;lept till the next mor|ning, when they awaked, finding their helmets lying by them, but not their armour, for tho&s;e newe men of warre had put them on &s;o properly, that by their countenaunces it &s;&eacute;emed they had &s;ome great combate to fight one again&s;t the other, in the top of the high elmes, whereof there were great plenty. But that &s;port liked not the two knights, that were loath to die in that place for want of food, but made their account, either to put them&s;elues a|gaine vnto the mercy of the waues, or el&s;e goe further into the I&s;land to &s;&eacute;eke meat. Wherfore making bowes of wood, which they &s;tringed with their garters, and cutting arrowes to them, &s;harpe at the points, they &s;hot at tho&s;e woody champions &s;o long,

<PB REF="45"> into a chamber to refre&s;h them&s;elues. Doughter (&s;aid the Empe|rour) both they and the Gentlewoman are mo&s;t heartely wel|come. My lord (&s;aied <HI>Carmelle</HI>) God pre&s;erue your grace: &amp; with|out further honour vnto him, &s;hee &s;toode &s;till and held her peace, whereat all the company began to &s;mile, thinking that want of ciuilitie cau&s;ed her to forget her &s;elfe. But not long after they changed their opinion, <HI>Carmelle</HI> beginning to &s;peak in this ma|ner. My lord, I haue beene nouri&s;hed all my life among the be&s;t knights liuing in y^e world, yet let not your grace find it &s;trange, if at the fir&s;t (being in your maie&s;ties pre&s;ence) I haue v&s;ed &s;o lit|tle honour to your grace, whereby your Gentlemen &s;hould haue cau&s;e to laugh at mee: For that want of vnder&s;tanding howe to behaue my &s;elfe in pre&s;ence of &s;o great a Prince is not the cau&s;e thereof, but onely the ioy I conceiue in my &s;elfe, to bee a &s;eruant vnto him, whom I more e&s;t&eacute;eme then any man liuing: and I on|ly hold for my lord and mai&s;ter, not knowing any worthier then he. And if it plea&s;eth your grace to know who it is, together with the cau&s;e of my arriuall in this countrey, I pray you &s;end for the two knights that brought m&eacute;e hether, &amp; I will &s;hew &s;uch things, whereat (it may be) your grace will be aba&s;hed. Gentlewoman (&s;aied the Emperour) you &s;hall therein doe mee great plea&s;ure. Wherewith hee commanded a Gentleman to goe fetch the two &s;traunge knights, who comming into the Emperours pre&s;ence, hauing ki&s;&s;ed his handes, and he welcommed them in courteous manner, he willed two chaires to bee brought, wherein hee &s;et them, being a Prince that alwaies entertained &s;traungers with great honour, e&s;pecially if hee knew them to be of forraine coun|tries. That done, all the knights, Gentlewomen, and ladies went n&eacute;ere to heare the Gentlewomans &s;p&eacute;ech, when &s;hee tur|ning vnto the Emperour, &s;aid in this manner: My lord, I thinke your grace hath long before this time knowne the ca&s;tle, called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> the which (during the life of valiant <HI>Char|tadaque,</HI> and &s;ince that time) you and the king of Turkie haue di|uers time a&s;&s;ailed to winne, although in vaine, it hath alwaies been &s;o well defended by the Giants <HI>Matroco</HI> and <HI>Frerion,</HI> yet in one day a knight alone hath conquered it, &amp; &s;lain the two giants
<PB REF="45"> whereof I &s;pake, with their vncle <HI>Arcalaus</HI> and <HI>Argantes</HI> the Porter of the &s;ame. And which is more, hath deliuered king <HI>Lui|&s;art,</HI> that lay pri&s;oner therein, no man knowing it, for h&eacute;e had ben &s;urpri&s;ed in great Brittaine, and &s;ecretly brought from thence by <HI>Arcabonne</HI> lady of the ca&s;tle: The which lady falling in de|&s;paire, threw her &s;elfe out of a window into the &s;ea. And to the end your grace may knowe how all hath happened: it is &s;o (&s;aied &s;hee) that <HI>Arcabonne</HI> (who as then I &s;erued) hauing intelligence of her brothers impri&s;onment in the Ferme I&s;le, departed ex|pre&s;&s;ely from the ca&s;tle, hoping to deliuer him, but before &s;he got thether, he was &s;et at liberty. Notwith&s;tanding (&s;he being loth to loo&s;e her labour) to bee reuenged thereof, did &s;o much by her art, that &s;he got king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> (as then hunting in the forre&s;t) into her tent, the king thinking to &s;uccour a Gentlewoman, that as hee thought a knight would haue defloured: where he was &s;o cruelly inchaunted, that lo&s;ing all his &s;ences, hee was tran&s;ported with|out any mans knowledge into the dungeon of the ca&s;tle, where my lord and mai&s;ter found him. And continuing her di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he &s;hewed in what manner <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was made knight, and &s;&eacute;e|king to find the king, h&eacute;e was carried by the boat of the great &s;er|pent into the I&s;le of the Enchauntre&s;&s;e, where he conquered the &s;hining &s;word, and after that brought in a little barke to the foote of the rocke called <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> the &s;p&eacute;ech hee had with the Hermite, the combates with <HI>Argantes, Matroco,</HI> and <HI>Frerion,</HI> the de&s;peratene&s;&s;e of <HI>Arcabonne,</HI> the determination &s;he had to kil him, when &s;he found him &s;l&eacute;eping in the hermitage, y^e loue wher|with &s;he was &s;odainly &s;urpri&s;ed. And la&s;tly, the means how king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> knew him: for my lord (&s;aid &s;he) he is &s;on of <HI>Amadis</HI> his &s;on, and of the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Oriane.</HI> And becau&s;e at his departure fro~ his father, he gaue him in co~mandement to come &amp; &s;erue the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> your doughter, with the other ladies, according to his promi&s;e, he hath expre&s;&s;ely &s;ent me hether, humbly be&s;&eacute;eching the~ to pardon the &s;low performance of his fathers wil: but to amend his fault committed, he will &s;hortly be here to fulfill his charge as long as plea&s;eth the~. Gentlewoma~ (&s;aid y^e Emperor) I knew his father for one of y^e be&s;t knights liuing in y^e world: notwith&s;ta~ding
<PB REF="46"> you haue &s;hewed &s;uch &s;trange things of his &s;on, that I certaine|ly bel&eacute;eue he farre &s;urpa&s;&s;eth him. He &s;hall b&eacute;e heartely welcome when he commeth, but if my daughter will follow my coun&s;ell, &s;he &s;hall not pardon his long ab&s;ence till he come in per&s;on to de|&s;ire the &s;ame: and let him bee a&s;&s;ured hee &s;hall not depart &s;o &s;oone from hence as <HI>Amadis</HI> hath done. At the lea&s;t, we will make him &s;o good cheare, and my doughter likewi&s;e, to whome I giue ex|pre&s;&s;e commandement to doe it, that hee &s;hall not haue occa&s;ion to di&s;like our company. Mean time the two knights &s;hal remain with vs for pledges, a&s;&s;uring you I will giue them all the honor and good intertainement that I can deui&s;e. My lord (&s;aid &s;hee) the de&s;ire they had to vnder&s;tand the things declared to your grace, hath cau&s;ed them for to come hether, with whome by great good fortune I met, for <HI>Frandalo,</HI> whom he (pointing to <HI>Manely</HI>) hath mo&s;t valiantly conquered, had taken mee pri&s;oner, not farre off from the place where I fir&s;t imbarked: but as fortune would, there ro&s;e &s;o great a &s;torme at &s;ea, that all his ve&s;&s;els &s;eperated one from the other, his &s;hip was ca&s;t vpon an I&s;land, wherein (by the &s;ame tempe&s;t) the&s;e two knights not long before arriued. And with that &s;hee &s;hewed what &s;p&eacute;ech they had with <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and what pa&s;&s;ed betw&eacute;ene them: Wherefore my lord, acquiting my promi&s;e made vnto them, I haue at large declared the aduen|tures of the good knight their companion. In faith (&s;aied the Em|perour) they haue &s;hewed them&s;elues right valiant knights, and made a worthy pre&s;ent vnto my doughter, for which I giue them thankes. My Lord (&s;aid <HI>Manely</HI>) w&eacute;e humbly be&s;&eacute;ech your grace, that from henceforth you will accept his &s;eruice, for it is his only de&s;ire, as he hath promi&s;ed vs. Is that po&s;&s;ible (&s;aied the Empe|rour?) For he is the vilde&s;t villaine that euer liued on earth, and hath more wronged my &s;ubiects then euer any did. My lord (&s;aied the king of Denmarke) he will become a new man, and there|fore my companion did pre&s;ent him to your daughter, which pro|mi&s;ed for to &s;aue his life, which we be&s;&eacute;ech your grace likewi&s;e to performe. I am content to doe it (&s;aid the Emperour) at your re|que&s;ts, though he de&s;erues it not. While they &s;at talking, <HI>Ga&s;til|les</HI> that &s;taied in the forre&s;t to looke vnto the hounds, entred into

<P>_YOu heard before howe <HI>Carmelle</HI> in pre&s;ence of the Emperour, &s;hewed the great de&s;ire &s;hee had to &s;lay <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and when &s;hee thought to doe it, &s;he was &s;o ouercome with loue, that during her life, &s;hee determined not to loue a|ny other, which the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> (that already pretended part in him) had not for|gotten, but returned with <HI>Carmelle</HI> into her chamber: with a &s;miling countenance &s;hee &s;aid vnto her. Is it po&s;&s;ible Gentlewo|man (&s;aid &s;he) you louing the knight with the black armes &s;o w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l as you report, that you could leaue his company &s;o &s;oon?

What hope then re&s;teth (&s;aid the Prince&s;&s;e) vnto you? The &s;ame (&s;aid &s;h&eacute;e) I know to be farre different betw&eacute;ene him and mee, for when I am in pre&s;ence, be|holding the excellency of his per&s;on, I then receiue &s;ome com|fort, which to him is vtterly denied, &s;&eacute;eing that already hee indu|reth for her &s;ake, that as yet he neuer &s;aw, and the (madame &s;aid &s;he) is your owne per&s;on, as I &s;aid before. Surely (&s;aid the Prin|ce&s;&s;e) his loue is very &s;trange, the foundation whereof I cannot well conceiue. Madame (&s;aid <HI>Carmelle</HI>) I feare ere it be long, hee will not be able to indure the great extreamitie wherein he now is fallen, onely for your &s;ake &s;pecially, if at his arriuall here, hee find him&s;elfe reiected of your grace, hauing no de&s;ire, but to fulfill your plea&s;ure, whereby he may account him&s;elfe your own, e&s;t&eacute;e|ming it the greate&s;t fauour that euer hee can haue.

<P>_IN manner as you heard before, the two knights of the Ferme I&s;le and <HI>Carmelle,</HI> &s;taied at Con&s;tantinople, where there arriued a certaine &s;hippe, that brought a Squire on me&s;&s;age from <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor</HI> to certefie the Emperour, that <HI>Armat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> king of Turkie, aduerti&s;ed of the death of <HI>Matroco</HI> had be&s;ieged the ca&s;tle, <HI>La montaigne defendu</HI> both by land and &s;ea, de&s;iring him to &s;end &s;ome aid, otherwi&s;e they &s;hould b&eacute;e con&s;trained to y&eacute;eld the &s;ame, not hauing victuals nor men for to defend it.

But con&s;idering with him|&s;elfe of what importaunce that Frontier ca&s;tle might bee vnto him if the enemy &s;hould obtaine it, he determined by all meanes to hinder him from the &s;ame. Wherfore calling for <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and taking him a&s;ide, he &s;aid vnto him: Well <HI>Frandalo,</HI> you are now my pri&s;oner, and it lieth in me either to hang you like a th&eacute;efe, or deliuer you with greater riches then euer you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which I promi&s;e you to doe, if from this time forwards you &s;weare to bee my loiall &s;ubiect, and faithfully to &s;erue me when you are imploi|ed.

And trauelling without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">duenture worthy the rehear&s;ing, at the la&s;t they arriued at the pallace of <HI>Apolidon,</HI> at the foote whereof they found the great Serpent, wherein pre&s;ently they imbarked them&s;elues, but &s;hee remooued not from thence till midnight fol|lowing, when &s;he began to &s;aile &s;o &s;wiftly, that the next day they were out of &s;ight of any land, in which manner they continued for &s;euen daies together, the eight day they di&s;couered a goodly country, &amp; hauing a calme wind, the Serpent put a &s;hore, which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> perceiuing, determined to land and walke along the coa&s;t, til he found &s;ome one or other, that could &s;hew him in what countrey hee had arriued. And de&s;iring mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> not to depart thence before hee came againe, hee, <HI>Sergil,</HI> and their two hor&s;es entered into a little boat, and taking land, they entered &s;o
<PB REF="49"> far into the countrey, that they came to a little hill, at the foote whereof they perceiued a goodly meddow, and certaine hou&s;es, wherevnto they went. And they had not ridden farre, but a lac|quie that kept foure hor&s;es, whereof one was a Bay, and greater then the re&s;t, came vnto <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and &s;peaking to him in the Almaine tongue, a&s;ked him why he went to his own mi&s;chiefe? <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> that in his youth had learned that language, a&s;ked him wherefore? Becau&s;e (&s;aid the lacquie) that at the next hou&s;e my mai&s;ter is newly alighted, and is at dinner, and if he &s;&eacute;e you, you die therefore? Thy mai&s;ter (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) And what doth he?

But as &s;oone as the Giant &s;aw him, hee ro&s;e vp, and leaning on the cloth, &s;aied vnto him: Thou vn|happy wretch, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath &s;ent th&eacute;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ther in my pre&s;ence, armed as thou art?

Wherewith one of them (thinking to play the diligent &s;eruant) ranne vnto <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> to &s;erue him for a Squire: but (whether <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was offended, or for that hee held the left &s;tirrop in &s;tead of the right) h&eacute;e gaue him &s;uch a blow on the face with his Gantelet, that hee felled him to the ground: whereat the Giant was in &s;uch a rage, that he &s;car&s;e had the pa|tience to arme him&s;elfe to bee reuenged. Wherefore &s;ending to fetch his great Bay hor&s;e, mounted thereon. Mean time <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> lacing his helmet, tooke his &s;word in hand, &s;taying for his e|nemy that cea&s;ed not to threaten him, who &s;taied not long before he came, bearing a great launce vpon his thigh, and &s;o great a ci|mitere hanging at his &s;addle bow, y^t a &s;traunge man would haue much adoe to lift it vp. But as you &s;&eacute;e a Cocke holding vp his
<PB REF="50"> head, and &s;tanding ready to receiue another Cocke wherewith he fighteth, &s;o <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> hauing felt the iniury hee had receiued at the Giants hands, &s;&eacute;eing him approch, began to &s;hake his leg, ready for to charge his enemy. But the Giant called him and &s;aid, Va&s;&s;aile, Content thy &s;elfe with the honour thou ha&s;t alrea|dy gotten, by putting me in &s;o great choler, that without any re|gard I haue taken armes again&s;t &s;o vile and wretched a thing as thou art: Flie then from hence without con&s;training me to do th&eacute;e any hurt, otherwi&s;e thou art mo&s;t &s;ure of death, for twenty knights hardier then thy &s;elfe, cannot once remoue me. <HI>E&s;plandi|an</HI> hearing his great brags, made no account thereof, but in moc|kery &s;aid vnto him.

They that beheld it were thereat aba&s;hed, &s;pecially the Gi|ants Squires, who pre&s;ently began to flie, but they had not run farre, when <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> ouertooke them, threatning to &s;lay them if they would not &s;hewe him the place where their mai&s;ter kept his pri&s;oners, which they promi&s;ed to do. And leading him along by the foot of the hill from whence hee had de&s;cended, they came into a narrow way full of &s;tones, where &s;tood a watch of twen|ty men all armed, each man with a hatchet in his hand to defend the pa&s;&s;age. When the captain of that band perceiued the giants &s;quires comming towards them, h&eacute;e a&s;ked the~ where they found that vnhappy fellow, and &s;aying &s;o, thought to lay handes vpon <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> bridle, but with a blow of his &s;word hee cut his arme
<PB REF="50"> in &s;under, wherewith the re&s;t &s;et all vpon him. But in &s;hort time he dealt &s;o well among them, that h&eacute;e laid mo&s;t part of them dead vpon the ground. But he had &s;o many men about him, that in the end his hor&s;e was &s;laine, and he in danger to be ouerthrown. Yet hee behaued him&s;elfe &s;o valiantly, and with &s;o great a courage, that hee remained victor, his enemies flying as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ibly they might: and among the re&s;t, the laquie that he found k&eacute;eping the foure hor&s;es, who &s;auing him&s;elfe in a vaut, cried with a loud voice and &s;aied, Come forth my lord, come forth, your &s;onne <HI>Bra|mato</HI> is &s;laine, and all our companions likewi&s;e. With that there appeared a great old Giant with a long white beard, who &s;&eacute;eing <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> with his &s;word bloody in his hand, and mo&s;t of his men lying dead about him, he ca&s;t out a great &s;igh and &s;aid, O immor|tall Gods, wherein haue I &s;o much offended you, that you &s;hould &s;uffer my only &s;onne and all my men to be &s;laine in &s;uch manner by this one knight? But I hope your wraths wil not be &s;o much increa&s;ed again&s;t me, as that you will not giue me leaue to be re|uenged on him. And as hee vttered tho&s;e words, beeing couered with his &s;hield, hee went vnto <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and holding his &s;word in hand, &s;troke him flatl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng with the &s;ame vpon the arme, in &s;uch maner that he was a&s;toni&s;hed: and with the force of the blow the &s;word &s;liding downe vpon a &s;tone, brake in thr&eacute;e p&eacute;eces, where|with <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;tepped to him, and with great dexterity &s;trooke him &s;o fiercely on the face, that the blood in great abundance ran out of his forehead. Whereat the Giant was in &s;uch a rage, that ca&s;ting downe his &s;hield, tooke the p&eacute;ece of his &s;word in both his hands, and with all his force &s;trooke at <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> that &s;tept a&s;ide, and perceiuing the Giants arme comming towards him, with one blow cut off his hand, whereby his &s;word fell downe. Neuer|thele&s;&s;e he &s;&eacute;emed not aba&s;hed, but imbracing <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> with his left arme, thought to cru&s;h the breath out of his body, but it hap|pened otherwi&s;e, for as hee held him, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> hauing his right arme at libertie, thru&s;t his &s;word into the Giants body, where|with he died. The~ calling <HI>Bramatos</HI> thr&eacute;e &s;quires that he brought thether to &s;hew him the pri&s;oners, hee a&s;ked where they were: My lord &s;aid one of them, on that &s;ide the vaut is the two Giants
<PB REF="51"> lodgings, that you haue &s;laine, and vnder it are the pri&s;oners that you &s;&eacute;eke in a mo&s;t darke pri&s;on aboue a hundred paces long, and but two paces broad, whereby the pri&s;oners (in great number) haue no meanes to re&s;t them&s;elues, beeing con&s;trained to &s;tand vpright for the narrowne&s;&s;e of the place. Goe before (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI>) with that the &s;quire went forward, and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> followed after, and they had not gone long, but they entred into a goodly pallace, and going lower, hee heard the lamentable voices of the poore pri&s;oners dying for want of food, whereat he tooke &s;uch com|pa&s;&s;ion, that the teares ran downe his eies, a&s;king the &s;quire for the keies? there they hang (&s;aid he) vpon a naile.

My good friends, come all forth, and thanke God for your liberties. You may well iudge if they were glad to heare tho&s;e newes, for that &s;ome of them had remained therein aboue thirtie yeares together, being in all twenty Gentlewomen, thirtie &s;quires, and fiftie knights, among the which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> knewe <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> who by euill fortune (after the conque&s;t of <HI>San&s;uegue</HI>) trauailing the country, were met by the Giants, and kept in pri&s;on with the re&s;t, where they indured great mi&s;erie.</P>

<P>_THe Giants &s;laine, and y^e pri&s;oners &s;et at liberty, <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> that as yet had not taken off his helmet, not long after made him&s;elfe knowne to <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> y^t were no le&s;&s;e aba&s;hed to &s;&eacute;e him in &s;o &s;traunge a place, then wondered at the great Prowe&s;&s;e he had &s;hewed for their de|liuery. It was then about &s;unne&s;etting, and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had nei|ther eat nor dronke of all that day, wherefore h&eacute;e determined not
<PB REF="51"> to depart thence till the next day in the morning, for hee found great &s;tore of victuals in the place: Commanding <HI>Sergil</HI> with one of the &s;quires to go &s;&eacute;eke the Bay hor&s;e he left at the hou&s;e where hee &s;lew <HI>Bramato,</HI> for his owne was &s;laine, which they pre&s;ently brought vnto him, pa&s;&s;ing the night in the Giants hou&s;e with the be&s;t victuals they could finde. The next day in the morning <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> called the pri&s;oners that he had deliuered, a&s;king them what they meant to doe? Sir Knight (&s;aied they) wee are wholly bent to doe as plea&s;eth you. Then my friends (&s;aid he) you &s;hal go to Con&s;tantinople, and there giue thankes vnto the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> for the grace it hath plea&s;ed G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d to giue you by means of a knight that belongeth vnto her.

Sir Knight (&s;aied hee) that &s;hewed him the pri|&s;on, they &s;hall finde within the hou&s;e all the furnitures and other things that were taken from them: &s;hew them where they be (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian.</HI>) Wherevnto he willingly obayed, which done, they all left the Giants hou&s;e, the pri&s;oners taking the way to|wards Con&s;tantinople, and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>La|zinde,</HI> armed at all points, went towards mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> that &s;tayed for them in the great Serpent, and as they were about halfe a mile from the Giants hou&s;e, they met a knight all armed with two &s;quires attending on him, who in courteous manner &s;aluting <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his company, a&s;ked them what countrey men they were. Sir knight (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) wee are all of great Brittaigne. Alas (&s;aid he) can you tell me any newes touching a thing that hath gr&eacute;eued me full &s;ore? What is that (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI>) can you tell mee (&s;aied hee) what is become of king <HI>Lui&s;art?</HI> For I haue ben certefied of a truth that hee is lo&s;t, not knowing where, how, nor for what cau&s;e. And for my part I &s;weare vnto you, I haue already &s;ought for him in diuers countries, and can

I maruaile then (&s;aid <HI>No|randel</HI>) what aduenture brought you hether. By my &s;oule (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) that can I not well tell, only that I was brought he|ther by the great Serpent which I left at the &s;ea &s;ide, wherein mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> &s;taieth for me. Then hee &s;hewed him how hee departed from the court, his arriuall in the Ferme I&s;le, his im|barking to take &s;ea, and what time they were at &s;ea before they di&s;couered any land, till in the end (&s;aied hee) we e&s;pied this coun|try, where <HI>Sergil</HI> and I tooke land, in good time for <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> as hereafter they may &s;hew you. But you (&s;aied hee to <HI>Norandel</HI>) tell me of your faith, how was it your chance in &s;o good time to m&eacute;et with vs? In truth (&s;aied <HI>Norandel</HI>) the peace made betw&eacute;ene <HI>Amadis</HI> and the king, I departed from the court to &s;&eacute;ek &s;ome &s;trange aduentures that commonly are found in this coun|try of Almaigne, where I had no &s;ooner arriued, but I had cer|taine newes of my fathers ab&s;ence, whereat I was &s;o gr&eacute;eued, that to find him out I haue trauailed the countries of Denmark, Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, Sweathland, Hungarie, and all this country e|uen vnto this place, where it is &s;aid there dwels two giants, who as they are all of one nature, exerci&s;e innumerable cruelties a|gain&s;t tho&s;e they m&eacute;ete, the yonger of them waiting continually
<PB REF="52"> about this place for &s;uch as pa&s;&s;e this way. And therefore when I &s;aw you fir&s;t, I thought one of you thr&eacute;e to be the Giant, thin|king to fight with him, or lo&s;e my life therefore: which I wil yet doe if you let me pa&s;&s;e. By God (&s;aied <HI>Gandalin</HI>) you lo&s;t your la|bour &s;&eacute;eking for the king, &s;o &s;hall you likewi&s;e doe if you take this enterpri&s;e in hand? Wherefore (&s;aied <HI>Norandel,</HI>) Becau&s;e (&s;aied he) you &s;&eacute;e him here in pre&s;ence that ea&s;eth you of that bur|then. With that he &s;hewed him in what manner <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had fought with the Giants, and how he, <HI>Lazinde,</HI> and diuer&s;e others were pri&s;oners in their hou&s;e, from whence <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had deli|uered them. Before God (&s;aied <HI>Norandel</HI>) the newes liketh mee wel, for I neuer thought in long time any &s;uch aduenture would haue happened vnto him, not knowing he had receiued the order of knighhood. You &s;&eacute;e it is &s;o (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) and mai&s;ter <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> can tell you more, if it plea&s;eth you to goe with vs. Let vs goe then (&s;aid <HI>Norandel</HI>) for I would gladly &s;&eacute;e him: With that they rode towards the &s;ea, till they e&s;pied the great Serpent, wherein they imbarked them&s;elues: where <HI>Norandel, Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> vnder&s;tood by ma&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> what had happened to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> from the day hee receiued the order of knighthood. And although <HI>Norandel</HI> determined with all &s;p&eacute;ed to return into great Brittaigne, yet hee chaunged his mind when hee heard &s;o &s;trange and maruailous news of his nephew <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> to who~ he &s;aid: My lord, &s;&eacute;eing fortune hath brought vs &s;o well together, I pray you let me not leaue your company till &s;ome occa&s;ion bee mini&s;tred vnto vs. Vncle (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) I am content, and I pray you let it be &s;o. In that manner they pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day in the great Serpent, minding the next day becau&s;e &s;h&eacute;e &s;tir|red not to take land againe to &s;&eacute;e if they could finde any more ad|uentures: And they had &s;car&s;e fallen a&s;l&eacute;epe, but the Serpent be|gan of it &s;elfe to &s;aile forward &s;o &s;wiftly, that by &s;unne ri&s;ing they had lo&s;t the &s;ight of any land, not cea&s;ing for to &s;aile &s;ixe daies together before they e&s;pied land: the &s;euenth day when the &s;unne began to &s;hine, it &s;taied at the I&s;le Saint <HI>Mary,</HI> which mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> pre&s;ently knew, as hauing ben there before with <HI>Ama|dis de Gaule,</HI> when he fought with <HI>Landriaque:</HI> wherefore he &s;aied
<PB REF="53"> vnto the knights. In good faith, I remember that once as I tra|uailed on the &s;ea with my lord <HI>Amadis,</HI> wee were ca&s;t vpon this I&s;land by &s;o great a tempe&s;t, that we thought verily to haue b&eacute;en drowned. And if then at &s;ea wee had great feare of death, b&eacute;eing landed, our feare did more increa&s;e, and that with &s;o good cau&s;e, that I cannot chu&s;e but tremble to remember it. What (&s;aied <HI>E|&s;plandian?</HI>) Can a danger &s;o long time pa&s;t br&eacute;ed &s;o great a feare as you &s;&eacute;eme to haue? Sir (&s;aied mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI>) &s;ome men to hide the truth, make a great matter of a &s;mall, but if you had &s;&eacute;en as much as I then &s;aw, and that which as yet you may behold, if it plea&s;eth you to goe where I was once, you &s;hall find that I haue no le&s;&s;e occa&s;ion, and there is <HI>Gandalin</HI> that can witne&s;&s;e it as wel as I. I pray you bring vs thether (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) with that they cau&s;ed the hor&s;es to be vn&s;hipt, and going to land, they mounted vp the I&s;land, til they came to the ca&s;tle where <HI>Amadis</HI> &s;taied certain daies to be healed of his wounds, where they found a knight that kept it forthe Emperour, who being aduerti&s;ed by mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> what knights they were hee had brought thether, bad them heartely welcome, offering them all the plea|&s;ure he could &s;hew, but they &s;taying not there, went forwards to the place where <HI>Amadis</HI> fought with <HI>Landriaque,</HI> where the Em|perour had erected both their Images &s;o like vnto them, y^t there wanted only life to expre&s;&s;e the &s;ame: Which mai&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> &s;hewed vnto the knights, and to the end (&s;aid he) you bel&eacute;eue mee better another time, I pray you behold well the forme of this great diuell, who before my lord <HI>Amadis</HI> arriued had vtterly de|&s;troied this mo&s;t fertile I&s;land. And therewith hee &s;hewed them from point to point what had pa&s;&s;ed touching the &s;ame, as you haue heard at large &s;et downe in the third booke of this our hy&s;to|rie, whereat they were all aba&s;hed, e&s;pecially to think how <HI>Lan|driaque</HI> could bee &s;laine or ouercome by one knight alone. For although this image were but a &s;encele&s;&s;e thing, yet it made the~ aba&s;hed, which hauing long time beheld, and vi&s;iting other pla|ces worthy memory, they returned to the great Serpent, which pre&s;ently departed from the I&s;le, and with a good winde, in fiue daies after arriued within half a mile of Con&s;tantinople, where
<PB REF="53"> it began to ca&s;t forth fire in &s;o furious manner, that the &s;aylers and others that perceiued it, fled all away, doubting the fury of that mon&s;ter, wherewith the Cittizens were in &s;uch a feare, that newes was brought vnto the Emperour, who as then was talking with the ladies, whom he led vnto the towers of his pal|lace to &s;&eacute;e what it might be, when they perceiued the great Ser|pent, and the &s;ea raging &s;o &s;ore about it, that it &s;&eacute;emed a gulfe of fire, wherewith they were in &s;uch a feare, and the Emperour likewi&s;e, that he co~manded al men to be armed, fearing it would come into the Towne, and &s;o de&s;troy them al. But <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> that had &s;&eacute;ene it oftentimes, a&s;&s;ured the Emperour that it was y^e &s;hip of the knight <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> which <HI>Vrganda</HI> brought fir&s;t into great Brittaigne. And to the end my lord (&s;aied hee) you &s;hall not doubt thereof, if it plea&s;eth you I will goe &s;&eacute;e if the &s;onne of <HI>Amadis</HI> be there, and bring him vnto you. Doe &s;o I pray you (&s;aied the Em|perour.) With that <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tilles</HI> went vnto the Hauen, entring into a Gally that hee found ready to put to &s;ea, commanding the mai|&s;ter thereof to row vnto the great Serpent, but what&s;oeuer hee could &s;ay, the mai&s;ter would not &s;tirre one foote, till &s;uch time hee threatned him with feare of being hanged. Wherefore hoi&s;ing vp his anker, the company began to row forward, but it was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to come neare the Serpent by a good bow &s;hot, and withall the &s;ea it was &s;o hie, that the waues ca&s;t them backe againe into the Hauen with &s;o great a force, that the Gally was in danger to bee ca&s;t away. Which the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> per|ceiuing, (who till then thought a&s;&s;uredly <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had expre&s;&s;e|ly come thether for to &s;&eacute;e her) began to de&s;paire of her good hope, and making her complaint, &s;aied vnto her &s;elfe: Alas mon&s;ter, &s;hip, Gally, or what ve&s;&s;ell &s;oeuer thou art, wherefore art thou now &s;o cruell vnto me, in not &s;uffering him that is within th&eacute;e to land at this our Hauen, to the end mine eies might enioy his pre&s;ence, but rather as if thou hadde&s;t conceiued a iealou&s;ie to|wards vs, thou v&s;e&s;t all meanes po&s;&s;ible to hinder the &s;hip wher|in my cou&s;in <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> &s;aileth, not to approch neare thee, that hee might bring him hether, or at the lea&s;t that w&eacute;e might hear &s;ome newes of him. But in faith, all well waied and con&s;idred, I think
<PB REF="54"> thee rather to haue rea&s;on, and my &s;elfe without con&s;ideration, for that &s;o excellent a thing ought not to bee &s;o lightly &s;et at liber|tie. Therefore it is no meruaile if thou refu&s;e him vnto vs, fea|ring lea&s;t thou &s;houlde&s;t loo&s;e him, &s;&eacute;eing thou mai&s;t well vaunt y^t in th&eacute;e there re&s;teth &s;o valerous knight, as in regard of him all o|thers may be nought e&s;t&eacute;emed. I would to God, that wee being both together, might neuer depart out of thy body: for being with him, his only pre&s;ence would br&eacute;ed in m&eacute;e &s;o much contentment, that I &s;hould thinke my &s;elfe to haue attained vnto the top of all felicity: and if his loue bee &s;uch as <HI>Carmelle</HI> hath a&s;&s;ured mee, it cannot be, but that he &s;uffereth the like pa&s;&s;ion I now indure, by ouermuch de&s;ire to &s;&eacute;e his per&s;on. Wherewith &s;hee remained in &s;uch an exta&s;ie, that by the changing of her colour, it might ea&s;ily be iudged her heart was not at ea&s;e, which in the end compelled her to &s;igh: and at the &s;ame in&s;tant to repent the &s;p&eacute;eches &s;he had v&s;ed vnto <HI>Carmelle,</HI> as al&s;o of the rich gowne that &s;he gaue vnto her. For (&s;aid &s;he vnto her &s;elfe) what know I, if my &s;w&eacute;et friend &s;&eacute;eing her apparrelled therin, would imbrace her, not for the loue of her, but for the gowne that once belonged vnto mee. And if it be &s;o, it is not to bee doubted, but &s;hee will by all meanes &s;&eacute;eke to ioine her lips to his, yea and her body like wi&s;e: which would bee wor&s;e, &s;&eacute;eing &s;he is neither &s;o euill fauoured nor of &s;o bad behaui|our, but it may be in a heat he would both forget him&s;elfe and me. But out alas what &s;aid I? Truly I doe him wrong to b&eacute;e &s;o iea|lous of him, con&s;idering the cha&s;t loue that is betw&eacute;ene them both, and therefore if it &s;o fall out, that in re&s;pect of mee hee &s;hall imbrace her body, beholding her apparrelled in a thing that &s;om|times &s;erued me, it will bee much more glory vnto me till I my &s;elfe may once imbrace his body, as in time I doubt not but I &s;hall. But if <HI>Leonorine</HI> were in paine, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had no le&s;&s;e, both &s;ollicited with like iealou&s;ie, for the great di&s;tru&s;t of their not m&eacute;eting at that time: and gladly would haue approched n&eacute;e|rer to each other, had it not b&eacute;ene that the one was on land vnder the gouernement of another man, the other at &s;ea within a ve&s;|&s;ell which he could not command. In the meane time the great Serpent &s;etting forwards, made &s;uch &s;p&eacute;ede, that in very &s;hort
<PB REF="54"> &s;pace it pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traights of Bo&s;phore. Wherewith the Prin|ce&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> was like to &s;ound, but &s;h&eacute;e refrained it as much as po&s;&s;ible &s;hee might, fearing to manife&s;t that, &s;he mo&s;t de&s;ired to k&eacute;epe &s;ecret. Whereby &s;he withdrew her &s;elfe halfe dead into her chamber, and making as if &s;he de&s;ired to &s;l&eacute;epe, threwe her &s;elfe on her bed, commanding her Gentle women to depart the cham|ber: they being gone, &s;he began againe to renue her &s;orrow, and almo&s;t drowned in teares, &s;aid vnto her &s;elfe: Alas, now I &s;urely &s;&eacute;e and well perceiue my gr&eacute;efe to be wholly without remedy, ha|uing &s;&eacute;ene the thing (that in all the world I mo&s;t intirely loue) &s;o n&eacute;ere vnto me, and at one in&s;tant &s;o &s;uddainly to depart, that it is vncertaine whether he is gone. Ha cruell torment that &s;till in|crea&s;eth in me &s;o couertly, is it po&s;&s;ible that from henceforth I can &s;o well di&s;&s;emble as yet I haue done? Truly no, for if in time pa&s;t I inforced my &s;elfe to e&s;t&eacute;eme the de&s;ire I had a &s;ingu|lar plea&s;ure vnto mee, nowe &s;&eacute;eing I well perceiue my accur&s;ed fortune to approch, and my ioy to fade, in manner as &s;oone as it was conceiued, I de&s;ire nought but death: which to me would be more acceptable, then liue in &s;o great paine, not hoping any ea&s;e. And leauing &s;o, &s;hee gaue &s;o great a &s;igh, that Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> heard it: Who fearing &s;hee had beene &s;icke, opened the chamber dore, a&s;king her how &s;he did. Wherewith the Prince&s;&s;e percea|uing that di&s;couery, to excu&s;e her &s;elfe the be&s;t &s;he could, &s;hee told the Qu&eacute;ene &s;hee dreamed. Madame (&s;aied the Qu&eacute;ene) it is not long &s;ince the Empere&s;&s;e &s;ent to &s;&eacute;e what you were doing? Is it not your plea&s;ure to ri&s;e and goe vnto her? Let vs goe (&s;aied &s;hee.) In the meane time <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> with his companions, &s;ai|led &s;o long, that within two daies after they perceiued the rocke of <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> and not farre from them the ve&s;&s;els and men of warre <HI>Frandalo</HI> had a&s;&s;embled, that &s;tayed for a wind to &s;urpri&s;e the Turki&s;h Army on the &s;ea: who percea|uing the great Serpent making towards them, began to arme them&s;elues, thinking that it had beene &s;ome mon&s;ter that came to deuour them. But <HI>Manely</HI> and the King of Den|marke that had &s;&eacute;ene it oftentimes before, were very glad, giuing them to vnder&s;tand what &s;uccours they might haue
<PB REF="55"> thereby, whereat they all reioiced, &s;pecially when they percei|ued <HI>E&s;plandian, Gandalin,</HI> and the re&s;t, that <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke knew, wherefore cau&s;ing a boat to bee made rea|dy, they with <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Argenton,</HI> the king of Denmarkes Squire (a very good marriner) entered into it, and rowing to the great Serpent, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> receiued them with great ioy, a&s;king <HI>Manely</HI> what fortune had brought them thether. In faith (&s;aied he) it is not long &s;ince we departed from the citty of Con&s;tanti|nople, to di&s;couer and to hinder the pa&s;&s;age of victuals that are daily brought by &s;ea from the Towne of <HI>Norolia</HI> vnto <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turks, who not long &s;ithence hath be&s;ieged the ca&s;tle of <HI>La montaigne defendu:</HI> expecting daily the comming of the Em|perour with a great army to driue the Turke from thence. But we haue had &s;o contrary a wind, that it hath ben impo&s;&s;ible for vs to effect our charge. In good truth (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) I would neuer haue &s;ought you in the&s;e countries, neither doe I knowe what became of you after w&eacute;e fell a&s;l&eacute;epe in this ve&s;&s;ell, I pray you tell it vs. Then <HI>Manely</HI> began to &s;hew how he and the king of Den|marke when they awaked found them&s;elues in a barke vpon the coa&s;t of Italy, where taking land they found <HI>Vrganda,</HI> and after that by cruell tempe&s;ts they arriued in an I&s;le, where a Beare a&s;&s;ailed them, in which I&s;le they &s;aw two great apes that &s;hew|ed them much &s;port. But (&s;aied hee) wee thought to haue &s;tarued therein for want of meat, for our victuals were cleane con&s;umed when by fortune <HI>Frandalo</HI> arriued in the &s;ame I&s;le, with whome I fought and ouercame him. And becau&s;e our barke was ca&s;t a|way, wee entered into his, wherein wee found a Gentlewoman that told vs newes of you, whom for your &s;ake we conducted vn|to Con&s;tantinople, and from thence haue brought her backe a|gaine. As farre as I vnder&s;tand (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) you haue not al|waies &s;lept, and I bel&eacute;eue that neuer any knight had fo &s;traunge aduentures at their fir&s;t entering into armes vnle&s;&s;e it were my lord <HI>Amadis</HI> my father, which I would hardly haue bel&eacute;eued, had it not ben for the &s;ignes and euident tokens that wee &s;aw in the I&s;le Saint <HI>Mary.</HI> What were they (&s;aid the king of Denmark?) We &s;aw the Image of <HI>Landriaque</HI> (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) with whome
<PB REF="55"> he had &s;o long and perrillous a combate. It is true (&s;aied <HI>Argen|ton</HI>) that &s;uch combates again&s;t mon&s;ters, doe oftentimes &s;trike the hardie&s;t knights with feare, and the combate of our Apes made &s;orrowfull knights reioice. In good faith &s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) thou ha&s;t rea&s;on, and I like th&eacute;e well for thy mirth, but I pray th&eacute;e heartely returne againe, and fetch the Gentlewoman that is in thy mai&s;ters &s;hip, and bring her hether, that I may &s;peake with her, which he pre&s;ently did: and as &s;he entred into the great Serpent, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> imbracing her, a&s;ked if &s;he had &s;&eacute;ene the em|perour and the beautifull Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> his doughter. I my lord (&s;aid &s;he) both of them de&s;iring your arriual in that coun|trey, e&s;pecially the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> with all the ladies and Gentlewomen, being fully determined not to pardon the great fault you haue committed in their behalfes, to haue deferred off &s;o long before you come to &s;erue them, according to the promi&s;e made by <HI>Amadis</HI> your father, as I a&s;&s;ured the~. Yet I thinke their di&s;plea&s;ure is not &s;o great, but yee may well find meanes to pace|fie the &s;ame. My good friend (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) you are heartely welcome, wee will talke together when better lei&s;ure &s;erueth. Which he &s;aid, fearing &s;he &s;hould haue proc&eacute;eded further, where|with the &s;tanders by might haue intelligence of the loue he bare vnto the Prince&s;&s;e, wherefore leauing the Gentlewoman, and turning to <HI>Manely,</HI> hee &s;aied: In faith I cannot well excu&s;e my &s;elfe, but that I doe them wrong, for the fir&s;t commaundement my father gaue mee at &s;uch time I receiued the order of knight|hood was, that in his place I &s;hould goe and &s;erue them, to quit the promi&s;e he had made. Neuertheles fortune hath euer &s;ithence giuen mee &s;o many cro&s;&s;es thereby to hinder my intent, that I could neither fulfill his wil, nor &s;ati&s;fie their expectations. While they were thus deui&s;ing, two of <HI>Frandalos</HI> Brigantines, that by him were &s;ent to e&s;py the enemies nauy, brought news they had &s;&eacute;ene great numbers of their Foi&s;tes and Gallies &s;ailing to the Ea&s;t, to fetch victuals for the Nauie, and that the re&s;t that re|mained behind would ea&s;ily bee ouercome, if it plea&s;ed them to &s;et vpon them: which the knights vnder&s;tanding, were of opi|nion, that without longer delay they would a&s;&s;aile them, and
<PB REF="56"> pre&s;ently therewith hoi&s;ed vp their ankers, making as &s;ecretly as they could towards <HI>Armatos</HI> fl&eacute;ete, yet they determined not to &s;et vpon them before the breake of day, hoping to take them &s;l&eacute;e|ping, which in truth fell out. The fir&s;t that &s;et vpon them was the great Serpent, that at her arriuall, entering among the ene|mies, ca&s;t fire &s;o fiercely at her mouth and no&s;thrils, that when they awaked it put them in &s;uch feare, that lo&s;ing courage with|out &s;troke giuen, they all began to flie: Neuerthele&s;&s;e it could not &s;aue their liues, but that the greate&s;t part of their ve&s;&s;els were drowned by meanes of a contrary wind, that ro&s;e &s;o &s;uddainely on the &s;ea, whereby it raged in &s;uch &s;ort, that neither ma&s;t, &s;ayle, bord, nor oare could holde, but were broken all in p&eacute;eces: yet did not <HI>Frandalo</HI> lo&s;e any of his fl&eacute;et, neither did the camp once moue thereat, for they were not &s;&eacute;ene of any other then the &s;entinell of the ca&s;tle, that pre&s;ently told <HI>Ambor</HI> and <HI>Talanque,</HI> wherat they receiued great plea&s;ure, e&s;pecially when they e&s;pied the great Serpent and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> with whome they talked long time before hee came to land.

<P>_THat aid entred into the ca&s;tle of <HI>La montaigne defendu, E&s;plandian</HI> de&s;irous to &s;&eacute;e the enemies campe, pre&s;ently mounted vpon the wals, accompanied only of <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> that &s;hewed him the tents of <HI>Armato,</HI> the Ba&s;&s;ias, Begberbeys, and Sangiaces, whereof &s;ome were lod|ged within the Ba&s;e court, which they had conquered at their
<PB REF="56"> fir&s;t comming thether, wherwith <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was much gr&eacute;eued, and a&s;ked <HI>Talanque</HI> how he &s;uffered them to come &s;o n&eacute;er. A&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe (&s;aid he) it was not with our wils, but we defended it as long as po&s;&s;ible wee might, and the Portaile like wi&s;e, which at their fir&s;t comming they a&s;&s;ailed. But we defended it &s;o well, that without their mine they had neuer won it, yet did it profite them but little, for that &s;odainly wee de&s;troied all their mine, that had co&s;t them fift&eacute;en daies labour. Which <HI>Armato</HI> perceiuing, &s;ought to begin againe, which we by diuers &s;allies would not &s;uffer him to doe: but what&s;oeuer we could doe, in the end their force preuai|led, and wee con&s;trained to for&s;ake the &s;ame, and retire vnto the ca&s;tle, and that in good time, for we were &s;car&s;e entered into the dungeon, but they fired it, whereby the Portall fell downe, gi|uing vs at that time one of the mo&s;t cruell a&s;&s;aults that euer place &s;u&s;tained, being &s;o meanely guarded as it was, and a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe, that there is neither loopehole nor window, but they rai&s;ed ladders or &s;ome other engins again&s;t it, and with launces, fire, and &s;word, gaue vs &s;o much to doe, that we were in doubt to be ouercome. Neuerthele&s;&s;e they were as whotely repul&s;ed, for <HI>Libee</HI> gaue them &s;uch intertainement with a dramme of pouder, that hee &s;et on fire, as they began to crie out victorie, but vpon a &s;uddain their cry became &s;o pittifull, that nothing but &s;orrow and lamentation could be heard among them, where with there were &s;o many of them burnt and &s;inged, that neuer &s;ince they dur&s;t ap|proch &s;o n&eacute;ere, although wee haue giuen them diuers &s;kirmi&s;hes, but for the &s;pace of eight daies we neuer i&s;&s;ued foorth, by rea&s;on (as you know) if wee &s;hould often i&s;&s;ue foorth, it is impo&s;&s;ible but &s;ome of our men mu&s;t of force bee &s;laine, and the death of one of ours would be more lo&s;&s;e vnto vs then the &s;laying of a hundreth of their men would profite vs. You haue done well (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandi|an</HI>) for all wi&s;e captaines ought to content them&s;elues with the &s;ure defending of a hold committed vnto them, not hazarding them&s;elues to lo&s;&s;e as long as po&s;&s;ible they may. But for the fur|ther &s;afetie of this ca&s;tle, I thinke it good wee take coun&s;ell what were be&s;t to bee done, lea&s;t wee bee &s;urpri&s;ed. Wherewith they went into the chamber where <HI>Matroco</HI> died, where they met to|gether,
<PB REF="57"> and (among diuers things propounded) it was concluded, that y^e next night they would i&s;&s;ue forth to &s;lay y^e enemies watch, which would ea&s;ily bee done, &s;&eacute;eing they had not any alarme in long time before. Wherefore euery man went to refre&s;h him&s;elf, till about eleuen of the clocke at night, when <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the re&s;t armed them&s;elues. And as they were all a&s;&s;embled in the court, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;tanding in the middle, &s;pake vnto them and &s;aied, My good friendes, wee are not now among the combates of great Brittaigne, where combates are fought more for fanta&s;ie, or vaine glory, then vpon any iu&s;t occa&s;ion: But this warre wee make again&s;t the proper enemies of our faith, &s;ummoneth vs not onely to doe our indeuours, but al&s;o to defend the honour and liberty of the name of Chri&s;tians. Wherefore my good compani|ons, I be&s;&eacute;ech you let euery man ca&s;t feare a&s;ide, preferring ver|tue before any inconuenience what&s;oeuer. A&s;&s;uring you (if wee doe &s;o) that before it be day, king <HI>Armato</HI> and his army &s;hall well find, we are not &s;o fainthearted as he e&s;t&eacute;emeth vs. Then calling <HI>Norandel</HI> vnto him, he &s;aid: Vncle, you, <HI>Manely</HI> and the king of Denmarke with a hundred men, &s;hall i&s;&s;ue fir&s;t to flay the Sen|tinels, and if you could doe the like vnto their watch, our enter|pri&s;e would bee brought to pa&s;&s;e as wee de&s;ire. But what&s;oeuer chanceth, &s;et you vpon them, and feare not the repul&s;e, for <HI>Gan|dalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde</HI> &s;hall &s;econd you with two hundreth more, by which meanes you may ea&s;ily retire if you be con&s;trained there|vnto. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, let no man &s;tirre from hence, till <HI>Frandalo</HI> and I be fir&s;t gone out, for that w&eacute;e two alone will goe into their campe to &s;&eacute;e what countenance they make, and as fortune fauou|reth vs, we will pre&s;ently ioine with you. With that hee &s;ent for two gownes of cloth of gold, and two Turki&s;h caps, whereof he gaue one vnto <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and kept the other for him&s;elfe, and be|ing armed vnder their apparrell, were &s;et downe (by the ladder of oords) on the &s;ea &s;ide, &amp; fainting to be &s;ome of the &s;ea captaines, went &s;traight vnto the campe, where they were &s;taied by the Sentinels, but <HI>Frandalo</HI> &s;peaking the Arabian tongue, could &s;o well di&s;&s;emble, that hee made them bel&eacute;eue, they went to aduer|ti&s;e the great Turke of a thing of great importance, whereby
<PB REF="57"> they let them pa&s;&s;e. Meane time <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turky &s;ate de|ui&s;ing in his tent with his familiar friendes, touching the lo&s;&s;e of &s;hips, whereof not aboue an hower before, he had receiued news by one of his marriners, that &s;aued him&s;elfe in a &s;mall Frigate: but the Turke could not by any meanes imagine how it came to pa&s;&s;e, &s;&eacute;eing his &s;pies that were newly returned from Con&s;tanti|nople, had brought him newes that the Emperour &s;tirred not, neither made any preparation to a&s;&s;aile him. And as <HI>Frandalo</HI> &amp; <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> entred the tent, they heard the marriner tell how that cruell ouerthrow happened by meanes of a mon&s;ter of the &s;ea, that came with the enemies fl&eacute;et. That (&s;aied hee) put vs in &s;uch fear, with ca&s;ting fire out of his mouth, no&s;e, and eies, that there|by the mo&s;t part of our men were burnt to a&s;hes. By all my gods (&s;aid <HI>Armato</HI>) it is &s;ome diuell that enuieth my pro&s;peritie. And it plea&s;eth your grace &s;aid one of his Ba&s;&s;aes, (that had &s;ailed in the mediteranian &s;eas, and heard &s;peaking of the great Serpent) there is nothing but art Magicke v&s;ed therein, whereof I am mo&s;t &s;ure, as hauing diuers times ben certefied thereof. Where|with they heard a great alarum, for <HI>Norandel</HI> and his company had i&s;&s;ued out of the ca&s;tle with white &s;carffes about their heads for to bee knowne, and had &s;o well &s;urpri&s;ed the watch about the ba&s;e court, that they had &s;laine them all, whereof <HI>Armato</HI> had in|telligence, as al&s;o that the enemies had gotten the i&s;&s;ue of the Portall, wherewith hee was &s;o moued, that in a great rage with very &s;mall company he went thether him&s;elfe, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &amp; <HI>Fran|dalo</HI> following after, as if they had been of his company. But be|fore their arriuall, <HI>Norandel</HI> had recouered the palla&s;adoes of the fortre&s;&s;e, and there &s;u&s;tained the whole Turki&s;h forces, &s;taying <HI>Gandalins</HI> comming. Now the entry of the court was &s;o narow, that more then thr&eacute;e men could not pa&s;&s;e through it at once, wherby tho&s;e of the ca&s;tle had in manner as much aduantage as their enemies. Which <HI>Ambor, Talanque, Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Libee</HI> made them well f&eacute;ele, comming likewi&s;e vpon them, for as the king arriued, they thru&s;t them cleane out of the place, whereby they fled in great ha&s;t, till the Turke him&s;elfe cau&s;ed them to &s;tay, and &s;&eacute;eing him, they tooke courage, turning their faces,

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. How Armato king of Turkie was committed vnto the cu&s;tody of Gandalin, and what conference he had with Frandalo.</HEAD>
<P>_THo&s;e of the ca&s;tle retired, as you heard be|fore, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> called <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Libee</HI> praying them to looke vnto king <HI>Armato,</HI> as al&s;o to the two Turki&s;h captaines, and appointing the watch as time required, went and laied him downe vpon his bed, not cea&s;ing all the night to thinke on the &s;p&eacute;ech <HI>Carmelle</HI> v&s;ed vnto him touching the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> whereby hee could not &s;l&eacute;epe till day be|gan to appeare, when <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the re&s;t of his knights entred into his chamber, to talke with him, not only as touching the in|tertainement of their pri&s;oners, but of other thinges that much imported them. And as they were in coun&s;ell together, <HI>Gandalin</HI>
<PB REF="58"> came vnto them, &s;hewing them that king <HI>Armato</HI> de&s;ired for to &s;peake with them, wherevpon they went out of the chamber to heare what hee would &s;ay. <HI>Frandalo</HI> could &s;peake the Arabian tongue better then the re&s;t, for that hee had &s;erued the king of Turkie, and hee knew him very well, wherefore <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> de&s;i|red him to &s;peake for all the re&s;t. And entring into the chamber, <HI>Frandalo</HI> went fir&s;t, who kn&eacute;eling on the ground, ki&s;&s;ed y^e kings hand. With that <HI>Armato</HI> thinking hee had beene pri&s;oner, a&s;ked him where he was taken. My lord (&s;aied he) I am now become a Chri&s;tian, and a knight of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, that hath done mee &s;o much grace, not long time &s;ince to call mee to bee one of his. A Chri&s;tian (&s;aid the king) is that po&s;&s;ible? By my &s;oule it maketh mee more aba&s;hed, then the cruell fortune that is now happened vnto mee: for that all knights following armes ought patiently to beare tho&s;e hazards that they fall into, v&s;ing nece&s;&s;itie as a vertue. But thou vnhappy wretch (that through feare and want of courage) ha&s;t for&s;aken our iu&s;t and holy law, wherefore take&s;t thou not a rope and hange&s;t thy &s;elfe, as vnworthy to goe vpon the earth? My lord (&s;aied hee) you may &s;ay what plea&s;eth you, as being priueledged for the greatne&s;&s;e of your e&s;tate, yet I can a&s;|&s;ure you, I neuer had &s;o cowardly a heart as you e&s;t&eacute;eme I haue, but rather account my &s;elfe happie to haue done that I haue done. Yet will I not refu&s;e to doe you &s;eruice (my honour &s;till re|&s;erued) in any thing I can. With that <HI>Armato</HI> remembred him|&s;elfe, and thought hee did him wrong, wherefore moderating his choler, he &s;aied vnto him: Friend <HI>Frandalo,</HI> If it gr&eacute;eueth mee to haue lo&s;t you, let it not &s;&eacute;eme &s;trange vnto you, &s;&eacute;eing now I had greater hope then euer I haue had to b&eacute;e &s;erued by your meanes. But &s;&eacute;eing it is &s;o, you knowe howe I haue v&s;ed you heretofore, now I pray you (if you may doe any thing for mee) to finde the meanes with your companions that I may bee deliuered from hence by &s;ome rea&s;onable compo&s;ition. My lord (&s;aied <HI>Frandalo,</HI> pointing to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) This is hee that hath all power and au|thoritie in this place, both ouer you and mee. With that <HI>Armato</HI> looked vpon him, and perceiuing him &s;o yoong without a beard, thought <HI>Frandalo</HI> &s;aied it to excu&s;e him&s;elfe, wherefore hee a&s;ked
<PB REF="59"> if he mocked him. God forbid I &s;hould doe &s;o my lord (&s;aied <HI>Fran|dalo</HI>) but I pray you bel&eacute;eue me, for it is true, that my lord <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> &s;tanding here before you is he and none other that &s;lew <HI>Ma|troco, Frerion, Arcalaus</HI> the inchanter, and <HI>Argantes</HI> the Porter of the ca&s;tle, which hee conquered, as you haue been aduerti&s;ed. By my head (&s;aied the king) I would hardly haue e&s;t&eacute;emed him for &s;o braue a man: but &s;&eacute;eing it is &s;o, I pray thee doe &s;omewhat with him touching the thing I told you of euen now. Bel&eacute;eue m&eacute;e my lord (&s;aid <HI>Frandalo</HI>) there &s;hall want no good will in me: and with that hee bad him God morrow, and leauing him with his guard, they went into the hall, where they found the tables ready coue|red for dinner, for it was about noone time. But as <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> re|&s;ted ill that night, &s;o hee made but a meane dinner, not being able to withdraw his mind from thinking on the prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> which was the cau&s;e that the Tables being vncouered, hee went into his chamber, without any company, onely the king of Den|marke, whom he loued as him&s;elfe, where being together, he be|gan to &s;hew him the cau&s;e why he &s;ent <HI>Carmelle</HI> to Con&s;tantino|ple, as al&s;o what affection hee bare to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine.</HI> And to the end (&s;aid he) you bee participant of my ioy, I pray you let vs haue her here, that &s;hee may &s;hew vs what &s;hee learned in her voyage.

Will you that I &s;end her word to bring it hether? It is well &s;aied (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) with that he called a Squire, &s;ending him to <HI>Carmelle,</HI> that as the~ was in company of <HI>Arcabonnes</HI> Gentlewomen: but vnder&s;tanding <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> plea&s;ure, went pre&s;ently to apparrell her &s;elfe as hee had willed her, and hauing a mantle on her &s;houlders becau&s;e &s;he would not be &s;&eacute;ene, went to him in his chamber, where &s;he found him and the king of Denmarke talking together: but as &s;oon as he e&s;pied her, he tooke her in his armes, and &s;etting her in a chair couered with veluet, &s;aied vnto her: My goodfriend, I meane to &s;hew my companion you &s;&eacute;e here, how much I loue and e&s;t&eacute;eme him, wherefore I pray you &s;hew me before him what intertaine|ment the prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> gaue you, knowing you came from

My lord (&s;aid &s;he) as &s;oone as I was arriued, and that &s;he vnder&s;tood the cau&s;e of my comming vnto her, I found her no le&s;&s;e yours then you hers: whereby I may e&s;t&eacute;eme you the happie&s;t knight liuing in the world. And know you why? She is &s;o faire, and of &s;o comely per|&s;onage, that vnle&s;&s;e it bee her &s;elfe none can re&s;emble her, and of truth &s;hee dooth farre &s;urpa&s;&s;e all other ladies, for being alone in her priuate chamber playing on &s;ome in&s;trument, or &s;inging for her plea&s;ure, &s;he &s;tealeth and raui&s;heth the harts (&s;eperated from the bodies of &s;uch) as either heare or &s;&eacute;e her: and if at &s;ometimes &s;he attireth her &s;elfe after the Italian manner, with a cap of that country fa&s;hion, then you may &s;&eacute;e her faire and gli&s;tering haire part giuing a certaine &s;hadow on her vermilion ch&eacute;ekes, the re&s;t knit vp together, inuironing her head, &s;hewing with farre better grace then any crowne that &s;he could weare, b&eacute;e it of &s;tones, lau|rell, or the fine&s;t gold that may be found. But if that be a tempta|tion vnto man, her two humble and mode&s;t eies (like two &s;uns) giue them as many deaths, as they at times behold the &s;ame, and againe reuiueth them better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hen at the fir&s;t, and all at one in|&s;tant: whereat you mu&s;t not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> aba&s;hed, &s;&eacute;eing that loue it &s;elfe doth often &s;kirmi&s;h and &s;triue in them, thereby to y&eacute;eld both pain and plea&s;ure vnto tho&s;e that doe behold the &s;ame: and if h&eacute;e touch her, he feareth to hurt her, as being in mo&s;t extreame pa&s;&s;ions of loue. And not without a cau&s;e, for that nature hauing made her, brake the mould, that &s;hee might be the only perfect creature, ac|companied with &s;o many vertues, that loue findeth nothing in her but bones to gnaw vpon. And I a&s;&s;ure you my lord, y^t &s;pea|king vnto her of tho&s;e thinges you had giuen mee in charge, I plainely perceiued her by the changing of her countenance to be charged with the like di&s;ea&s;e whereof you &s;till complaine: for &s;ometimes &s;he blu&s;hed, and againe became pale, and otherwh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">les was at &s;uch an exegent, that &s;hee could not an&s;were mee a ready woord: e&s;pecially when I pre&s;ented her with the ring that &s;hee once gaue to <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">di</HI> your father, as &s;he told mee afterwards: In recompence whereof &s;hee &s;endeth you this hairelace, which &s;hee mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ireth you to k&eacute;epe for the loue of her, and as the

With that &s;hee tooke a little boxe out of her bo&s;ome wrapped in a p&eacute;ece of Taffata, and gaue it vnto him, which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> re|ceiued, and taking it out of the boxe, he &s;ighed tenderly and &s;aied: Ha mo&s;t fortunate pre&s;ent, (the fir&s;t witne&s;&s;e of the perfect alli|ance that the mo&s;t loiall louers that euer liued had together, from whom is de&s;cended the Paragon of all beauty) happy to haue ap|proched &s;o n&eacute;ere her per&s;on: But I much happier that receiueth it, as more affectioned to &s;erue her then any other liuing on the earth: and it plea&s;eth God, while life indureth, I tru&s;t thou ne|uer &s;halt depart from mee, but I will k&eacute;epe th&eacute;e as carefully, as I de&s;ire &s;he &s;hould hold my heart.

Neuerthele&s;&s;e, for a time hee kept it &s;ecret, vntill one night hee being a bed with the Qu&eacute;ene, where they lay talking of the &s;icklene&s;&s;e of this world, hee di&s;co|uered his whole mind vnto her, and how h&eacute;e determined to make <HI>Amadis</HI> his &s;onne king and gouernour of his country: to the end he might fr&eacute;ely and without any interruption withdraw him&s;elf to his ca&s;tle of Mirefleur, where (by Gods helpe) he meant to liue a &s;olitary life. The Qu&eacute;ene that was one of the wi&s;e&s;t and de|uoute&s;t ladies in her time, confirmed him &s;o well in his opinion, that they agr&eacute;ed to returne to London, there to accompli&s;h their pretence. And the next day they departed from Mirefleur, accom|panied of <HI>Amadis, Gran&s;ador,</HI> and others, and comming to Lon|don, after they had remained there a certaine time, the Qu&eacute;ene &s;ent for all the nobilitie: who being arriued at the court, cau&s;ed a &s;caffold to bee made in the principall place of all the citty where the people might repaire. And as he and the Qu&eacute;ene both appar|relled in their roiall robes, each &s;et in a chaire of e&s;tate, <HI>Amadis</HI> &s;itting &s;omwhat lower on his right hand, and <HI>Oriane</HI> on the left, were come thether a Herauld crying thrice, that all the people &s;hould k&eacute;epe &s;ilence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the king with a &s;tately countenaunce and
<PB REF="62"> Princely magnanimitie turning to the people, &s;aied vnto them. My good friends and loial &s;ubiects, before I begin to &s;hew you the cau&s;e why I haue made you to repaire vnto this place, I wil put you in mind of part of the dangers and great hazards wherein I haue often fallen &s;ince the death of my brother of famous memo|ry king <HI>Falangris,</HI> whe~ it plea&s;ed God to call me vnto the gouern|ment of this land, and as I thinke there are yet many of you li|uing that can wel remember the danger wherein both I and my country thought to fall, when by the meanes and &s;ubtletie of <HI>Ar|calaus</HI> the inchanter, I was deliuered into their hands that long time before had con&s;pired my death, from whence my &s;onne <HI>A|madis</HI> deliuered mee: Yet not long after by euill coun&s;ell, I made warre again&s;t him, which ended as all men know, fortune enui|ous of my felicitie, afterward prepared mee &s;uch a banket, that without his helpe I had beene pri&s;oner with king <HI>Arauigne,</HI> and vtterly ouerthrowne. And that which hath yet more a&s;toni&s;hed mee was, that when I thought my &s;elfe &s;ure and out of danger of all mi&s;haps, a wor&s;e then all the former &s;uddainely chanced vnto me, the which (con&s;idering the place wherein I was) I thought verely to haue ben the end and con&s;umation of my daies. Neuer|thele&s;&s;e the Lord God regarding me in pitty, &s;ent my yong &s;onne <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> to my &s;orrowfull pri&s;on, from whence h&eacute;e hath deliue|red mee, as no doubt you haue heard. Now my good &s;ubiects you all &s;&eacute;e m&eacute;e to bee very old and white haired, hauing already attai|ned to the thr&eacute;e&s;core and tenth yeare of mine age, which maketh me think it time now to forget all wordly plea&s;ures, and to &s;erue God to whom I am &s;o much bound: And for this cau&s;e I haue de|termined from henceforth to for&s;ake all royall dignity, and leaue you my &s;on <HI>Amadis</HI> for your king, to whome at this time I y&eacute;eld both my Crowne, Scepter, and all the right I haue vnto the go|uernement of this land: praying you all as much as po&s;&s;ibly I may, that hereafter you will bee faithfull and true &s;ubiects vnto him, as you haue alwaies ben to me. And although h&eacute;e b&eacute;e but my &s;onne in law, if I knew him vnworthy of the place, bel&eacute;eue mee my good friendes, I would &s;ooner chu&s;e a m&eacute;ere &s;tranger for my &s;ucce&s;&s;or, then I would doe him: but there is not one among you
<PB REF="63"> but knoweth well his great de&s;erts, and of what race hee com|meth: that at this day may well bee called one of the mo&s;t noble and happie&s;t linages in all the word, as being de&s;cended from the valiant Troyans, whereof the memory &s;hall indure for euer. He is a kings &s;onne, heire vnto the crowne of France, &amp; now your Prince and Gouernour, and &s;o I leaue him vnto you, with my daughter your Qu&eacute;ene and lawfull Prince&s;&s;e: holding to my &s;elfe only the ca&s;tle of Mirefleur, where (with Gods helpe) the Qu&eacute;ene and I will end our daies religiou&s;ly, &s;eruing God, as we are bound to doe. Then calling <HI>Amadis,</HI> giuing him his royall mantle, he willed him pre&s;ently to put it on, the like did the qu&eacute;en to <HI>Oriane.</HI> Mean time the &s;ilence was &s;o great, that nothing could b&eacute;e heard among the people but cries and lamentations, mooued with pitty &amp; compa&s;&s;ion to &s;&eacute;e the determination of their Prince: who being apparrelled in a &s;imple robe of blacke cloth, tooke his &s;onne and the Qu&eacute;ene his daughter, &s;et them in their regal &s;eats, and in pre&s;ence of all the people, &s;et each of them a crown of gold vpon their heads, cau&s;ing them to be proclaimed by the Heralds, King and Qu&eacute;ene of great Brittaigne: That done, euery man departed, &s;ome w&eacute;eping, and others glad, for the aduancement they hoped from the new king, who from thenceforth began &s;o wi&s;ely to gouerne his country, that neuer was any prince better beloued nor obaied of his &s;ubiects. King <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> within &s;hort time after (accompanied of the Qu&eacute;en and <HI>Grumedan</HI>) went vnto Mi|refleur as hee had determined to doe, where they liued &s;o au&s;tere|ly, helping and being pre&s;ent at euery houre when &s;eruice was to be &s;aied as readily as the poore&s;t of the old men that remained there, for the admini&s;tration and &s;eruice to the religious women in the mona&s;ter of the deuout Abbe&s;&s;e Adala&s;ta. But when king <HI>Amadis</HI> perceiued his meanes to recompence tho&s;e of whome in his yoong yeares hee had receiued great plea&s;ure and &s;eruice, hee began to exalt <HI>Arban de Norgales,</HI> giuing him one of the faire&s;t I&s;lands in his country, to <HI>Gandales</HI> the lands of the duke of Bri|&s;tow, to <HI>Gandalin</HI> (as then ab&s;ent) hee gaue the lands of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">calaus</HI> the inchanter, he made <HI>Angriotte de&s;trauaulx</HI> great mai&s;ter of his hor&s;e, <HI>Guilan le pen&s;ife</HI> high &s;teward of his hou&s;e, <HI>Ardan le nain</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. How the towne of Alfarin in Turkie being a&s;&s;aulted, was taken by E&s;plandian and the re&s;t of his company.</HEAD>
<P>_NOt long after the &s;iege of <HI>La montaigne defendu</HI> was rai&s;ed, and <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> arri|ued at the ca&s;tle as you heard before: <HI>Frandalo</HI> had adui&s;e by <HI>Belleris</HI> his ne|phewe, (that returned out of Turkie, where hee had been to &s;&eacute;e what newes in the countrey) that <HI>Alforax</HI> &s;onne to king <HI>Armato,</HI> and gouernor of y^e great Cittie of Ta&s;ifant, vnder&s;tanding the impri&s;onment of his father, with the ouerthrow of the Turki&s;h armie, was departed from the towne of Alfarin: where hee had
<PB REF="64"> left the beautifull Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxa</HI> his wife, doughter to <HI>Am|phirion</HI> king of Medea, to go with all dilligence to &s;et order in his owne gouernement, and rai&s;e more men, thereby to re&s;i&s;t the Chri&s;tians power if they entred further into y^e countrey. Which vnder&s;tood by <HI>E&s;plandian, Ga&s;tilles, Ambor, Manely,</HI> and the king of Denmarke, they determined to enter into Turkie, wherevn|to by many rea&s;ons <HI>Frandalo</HI> per&s;uaded them, &s;hewing them what meanes they had to be&s;iege the town of Alfarin, not aboue two daies iourney from them, being hardly prouided of victuals, and no Garri&s;on therein: Wherfore it was agr&eacute;ed among them, that <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> with his Nauie of &s;hips &s;hould depart the next eue|ning in as &s;ecret manner as hee could, to &s;&eacute;e if he might &s;urpri&s;e their Hauen, and that they on the other &s;ide would trauaile all night, whereby they might be&s;iege the Towne both by land and &s;ea, entring therein before the Turkes &s;hould hear news there|of. And as they agr&eacute;ed, they put the &s;ame in execution: in &s;uch ma|ner that <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> (giuing forth that he would returne againe vn|to Con&s;tantinople) about &s;unne &s;etting tooke &s;hip, when hee put to &s;ea, the moone &s;hone bright, wherfore hoi&s;ing vp their ankers, they &s;et &s;aile: And they had not &s;ailed long, but he called his ch&eacute;ef Captaines together, di&s;couering his enterpri&s;e vnto the~, where|with pre&s;ently leauing the way to Con&s;tantinople, they made towards the towne of Alfarin. On the other &s;ide, <HI>Frandalo</HI> &s;lept not, when he perceiued his time, (all the company being alreadie aduerti&s;ed that he meant to goe by night) they i&s;&s;ued out of the ca&s;tle, euery man carrying victuals with him for the &s;pace of four daies: And they trauailed &s;o long, that about the breake of day they came vnto a great forre&s;t, where they &s;taied in ambu&s;hme~t till the nert night following, when they i&s;&s;ued forth, and about thr&eacute;e of the clocke at night they came vnto a path that went two waies, where <HI>Frandalo</HI> cau&s;ed them to &s;tay, and calling <HI>E&s;plandi|an,</HI> &s;aid vnto him: My lord, I pray you let vs two and no more take the way that leadeth on the left hand, and <HI>Belleris</HI> my ne|phew &s;hall guide the re&s;t of our company to the mountaigne of Yarebreh, from whence they may ea&s;ily &s;&eacute;e if our Nauy be n&eacute;ere the citty of Alfarin: and then as they finde the enterpri&s;e goe for|ward,

Let vs goe (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian:</HI>) with that <HI>Belleris</HI> and his company went their way, and <HI>Frandalo, E&s;plandian, Sergil,</HI> with the Gentle|woman of Denmarke tooke the other way, who about y^e breake of day arriued at the aduenturous fountaine, where there &s;toode foure great copper pillers all gilded, and at each piller hong a ta|ble with certaine writings therein, the contents whereof when time &s;erueth you &s;hall heare declared, as al&s;o the occa&s;ion why they were &s;et vp. Being arriued there, not farre off they percea|ued a light that i&s;&s;ued out of a Taffata pauillion that &s;toode vpon the &s;ide of the fountaine, wherevnto they approched as couertlie as they could, where they perceiued a mo&s;t beautiful Gentlewo|man combing of her haire, and not farre from thence twenty knights all armed k&eacute;eping watch about her, among the which was a &s;quire holding a hor&s;e all trapped with cloth of gold. But <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> were no &s;ooner arriued, but they were di&s;couered, yet they fearing a greater ambu&s;h, the mo&s;t part of them lo&s;ing courage, began to flie away: which the two knights perceiuing, entred among them, and at their fir&s;t comming ouer|threw foure or fiue of them vnto the ground, forcing them that were behind to returne againe, wherewith there began a fierce and cruell battaile, for tho&s;e that fir&s;t began to runne away (loo|king backe and perceiuing only two knights that &s;et vpon their fellowes) were &s;o a&s;hamed, that they turned again to help them: neuerthele&s;&s;e without the force of thr&eacute;e Giants that held again&s;t the knights, they could not haue indured &s;o long again&s;t <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo,</HI> but they thr&eacute;e fought &s;o valiantly with them, that the two knights were in the greate&s;t danger then euer they were before. And as you &s;&eacute;e a Boare foming at the mouth (follo|wed of a troope of dogs) &s;et his taile again&s;t a tr&eacute;e, and with his
<PB REF="65"> tu&s;kes teare and rent the fle&s;h of the bolde&s;t dogs that doe a&s;&s;aile him, &s;o were <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> among the knights they had a&s;&s;ailed, &s;triking both on the right hand and the left with &s;o great fury, that at one in&s;tant two of their principall enemies were &s;laine, &s;o that there remained but one Giant to fight with them, with whom <HI>Frandalo</HI> made his party good, while <HI>E&s;plandi|an</HI> followed the re&s;t, that as then began to flie. But when the Gi|ant perceiued <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> returne, being in feare of death, he &s;tep|ped a&s;ide and &s;aid vnto <HI>Frandalo,</HI> Sir Knight, you and I haue of|ten beene companions in many haulty enterpri&s;es, I pray you therefore &s;hew m&eacute;e the fauour to receiue mee vnto mercy, other|wi&s;e you might b&eacute;e blamed of tho&s;e that know vs both, for I am your cou&s;in <HI>Foron.</HI> Whereat <HI>Frandalo</HI> was much aba&s;hed, &amp; could hardly bee per&s;uaded therevnto, wherefore hee praied him to put off his helmet, and if it be true (&s;aid he) that thou art <HI>Foron,</HI> I wil v&s;e th&eacute;e both like a friend and kin&s;man. Wherewith the Giant di&s;armed his head, whereby <HI>Frandalo</HI> knewe him and imbraced him, whereat <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was much aba&s;hed, not knowing what had pa&s;&s;ed betw&eacute;ene them, with that hee went n&eacute;erer vnto them, a&s;king vpon what cau&s;e that &s;alutation proc&eacute;eded. Then <HI>Franda|lo</HI> tolde what the Giant was, de&s;iring him likewi&s;e to take pittie on him: which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> agr&eacute;ed vnto, then they thr&eacute;e together went vnto the pauillion, at the entry wherof they found the gen|tlewoman talking with <HI>Carmelle,</HI> no more aba&s;hed at the ouer|throw of her men, then if &s;hee had &s;&eacute;ene them iu&s;tle for their plea|&s;ures. She was apparrelled in a gowne of Dama&s;ke all imbro|dered and &s;et wih Pearles and precious &s;tones, <HI>Frandalo</HI> pre&s;ent|ly knew her, as hauing &s;&eacute;ene her oftentimes, e&s;pecially the &s;ame day &s;hee was married to <HI>Alphorax</HI> where hee iu&s;teled and did &s;o valiantly, that &s;he intertained him for her knight, wherfore ligh|ting on foote, and pulling off his helmet, hee &s;aluted her in mo&s;t humble manner. Wherewith &s;hee being aba&s;hed to &s;&eacute;e him that &s;he e&s;t&eacute;emed wholly to be hers, &s;o to haue behaued him&s;elf again&s;t her guard, &s;aid vnto him: How now <HI>Frandalo,</HI> is this the &s;eruice I looked for at your hands, hauing receiued you for my knight?

Madame (&s;aid <HI>Frandalo</HI>) &s;ince y^e time I became your knight, at the la&s;t tourney that I ranne, a lord of greater power hath in|tertained me into his &s;eruice, whom I wil &s;erue during my mor|tall life, &s;&eacute;eing it hath plea&s;ed him to &s;hew me &s;o great fauour, be|ing wel a&s;&s;ured, that when you know him as I do, you wil e&s;t&eacute;em me happy, how cowardly or villainous &s;oeuer you account mee now. What is he (&s;aid &s;he) tel me of your faith? it is Ie&s;us Chri&s;t (&s;aid <HI>Frandalo:</HI>) yet wil I neuer faile to do you all the honour and &s;eruice that I can, as al&s;o now at this time, &s;o my companion b&eacute;e content, for without him I cannot doe it. <HI>Frandalo</HI> (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandi|an</HI>) you may command mee, for I am ready to doe what plea&s;eth you: Wherefore delay not to do all the plea&s;ure &amp; &s;eruice you can vnto this lady if it be your will. Wherewith <HI>Frandalo</HI> thanked him mo&s;t hartely, and &s;aied to <HI>Heliaxe:</HI> Madame, &s;&eacute;eing hee will haue it &s;o, I pray you from henceforth put all your tru&s;t in mee, and I will not faile to be carefull for you: Mean time I pray you get vpon your palfrey, that I may bring you to a place where you may &s;&eacute;e farre better tourneyes then any at your wedding: af|terward (if it plea&s;eth God to fauour vs) you &s;hall ea&s;ily perceiue how much I e&s;t&eacute;eme and haue in remembrance the fauours you haue heretofore &s;hewed vnto mee, being but a &s;imple knight, and you a great Princes to command farre better then my &s;elfe: for neuer was Prince&s;&s;e more honoured and e&s;t&eacute;emed among her owne &s;ubiects then you &s;hall bee of them, to whome I meane to bring you, which may bee an example vnto kings and mightie Princes, to whome God hath giuen power and authoritie, who being aduerti&s;ed of the honourable and good intertainment made to you by vs, they may be moued hereafter to take plea&s;ure in in|tertaining the meaner as wel as the greater, con&s;idring the mu|tabilitie of fortune, as by your &s;elfe it well appeareth. <HI>Frandalo</HI> (&s;aied &s;he) you may make as many excu&s;es and faire promi&s;es as you li&s;t, yet can you not deny but you haue done mee wrong, yet
<PB REF="66"> in doing as you &s;aie you will, your reputation will bee better to the world, although your faith hath failed to our gods: wherefore let vs goe where it plea&s;eth you. With that &s;he got vpon her pal|frey, and <HI>Frandalo</HI> bareheaded leading her hor&s;e, till they came n&eacute;ere vnto the towne, where they heard a great noi&s;e, that made the two knights thinke, either their enterpri&s;e to be di&s;couered, or that their Souldiours a&s;&s;ailed the Towne. And fearing they had ben repul&s;ed, began to repent them&s;elues of their long &s;tay|ing with the Prince&s;&s;e, to whom <HI>Frandalo</HI> in mo&s;t courteous ma|ner &s;aied: Madame, Is it not your plea&s;ure (meane time that I and my companion goe vnto the towne) to &s;tay here for vs with this Gentlewoman and my cou&s;in <HI>Foron?</HI> I truly (&s;aid <HI>Heliaxa</HI>) and I will not depart from hence before I heare of you againe. With that <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> ranne in great ha&s;t towards the Towne, where they found their companions fighting with tho&s;e of Alfarin, among the which were <HI>Talanque, Ambor,</HI> the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Lazinde,</HI> that had giuen the town a hard &s;kirmi&s;h on that &s;ide, thinking to giue them &s;o much to doe, that in the meane time the army by &s;ea might a&s;&s;aile the water gate: but they were too &s;oone di&s;couered, whereby they found great re&s;i&s;tance on all &s;ides: Neuerthele&s;&s;e <HI>Norandel</HI> and <HI>Belleris</HI> had gotten the Barriers, and repul&s;ed the enemies vnto the palli&s;adoes. Which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo</HI> perceiuing, they lighted on foot, and being couered with their &s;hields, their &s;words in their hands, pa&s;&s;ed through the prea&s;e, and with bold courage, went &s;o farre, that they &s;lewe great number of the enemies: for the Alfarins to defend their citty i&s;&s;ued out of the gates, and the Chri&s;tians to winne it, did mo&s;t valiantly, but the place was &s;o narrow, they could not hurt their enemies &s;o much as in the ope~ field. Whereby it happened, that <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> min|ding either to winne or loo&s;e, &s;tepped &s;o farre forward, that the Alfarins flying into the towne, and they after, found them&s;elues alone within the &s;ame among their enemies, and that &s;o farre, that had it not ben for <HI>Frandalo, E&s;plandian</HI> (that tooke no care but only to kill and ouerthrow the enemy) had ben inclo&s;ed by them, but hee pulled him backe. Whereby the two knights perceaued
<PB REF="66"> the danger they were in, wherefore by little and little they got vnto the &s;teps, that went vpon the wall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> where they &s;u&s;tained many hard a&s;&s;alts without being hurt, although the enemy cea|&s;ed not to throw Launces, Stones, Darts, and all other wea|pons at them they could find, none of the~ daring come to handle &s;trokes, for if any aduanced him&s;elfe to &s;hew his Prowes, it co&s;t him his life, or els was throwne downe headlong. Meane time <HI>Norandel</HI> and his company, that had &s;&eacute;ene <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandi|an</HI> &s;hut into the towne, &s;ought by all meanes to &s;cale the wals, or el&s;e to breake the gates: but all in vaine, for they within defended it &s;o well with Oile, &s;calding Water, Logs and Stones, that di|uers of them were ouerthrowne, and ended their liues mo&s;t mi|&s;erably. And fighting in that &s;ort, a knight all armed came from the Hauen, crying with a loud voice and &s;aid: Be of good courage my children, be of good courage, defend this quarter well, for our enemies on the &s;ea &s;ide haue not as yet found meanes to &s;et one man on land, and yet haue lo&s;t aboue two hundred of their men. By God (&s;aied one of them) I &s;&eacute;e not one that &s;tandeth idle, yet can we not ouercome the&s;e two knights. Why &s;o (&s;aid the other?) They are (&s;aied he) entered in among vs, and wee haue ben the&s;e two howers fighting with them, but all in vaine, for the yoonge&s;t of them fighteth &s;o valiantly, that wee dare not approch them: And which is more, hee and his companion in de&s;pight of vs all haue gotten tho&s;e &s;taires, where they now defend them&s;elues, and that &s;o well that we can find no means to driue them thence, although many of our men haue been &s;lain by them, &amp; others cru|elly wounded. I am of opinion (&s;aid the knight) that wee receiue the~ vnto mercy, for it may bee they are &s;uch men, that for to haue them againe, the enemy will b&eacute;e glad to giue king <HI>Armato</HI> in ex|change, and returne againe into their country. Wherevnto they all ag&eacute;ed, and therewith the knight that had giuen them that coun&s;ell, made &s;ignes vnto <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> that they would parley with them, whereby the a&s;&s;ault cea&s;ed for a time, and the knight &s;pake vnto them in this manner, Sir knights, you &s;&eacute;e it is impo&s;|&s;ible for you to e&s;cape from hence, and it were great pitty that two &s;o valiant knights &s;hould die &s;o yoong now in the flower of
<PB REF="67"> your ages. But this wee will doe, y&eacute;eld your &s;elues, and wee will &s;aue your liues. Sir knight (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) If wee die at this time, we are quit for euer after, but &s;o much there wanteth ther|of, and wee haue &s;o good hearts and &s;o &s;ure a confidence in Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, in who&s;e quarrell we fight, that wee hope he will giue vs meanes not only to e&s;cape this danger, but to &s;poile the Towne and lead you pri&s;oners with vs: Wherefore take this coun&s;ell for your &s;elues, and y&eacute;elde you vnto vs before the wrath of God b&eacute;e further moued again&s;t you. When they that &s;tood about them heard tho&s;e wordes, both great and &s;mall began to crie with a lowd voice, &s;aying: Stay that villaine, let him die, or wee will die here at his f&eacute;et: wherewith they a&s;&s;ailed them &s;o fiercely, that they were con&s;trained to get vpo~ the highe&s;t &s;teps. But not long after they repul&s;ed the enemy &s;o valiantly with &s;tones (whereof they found great quantity vpon the Portall) that from that time forwards they had no longer &s;tomacks to a&s;&s;aile them. But <HI>No|randel</HI> and the re&s;t being without, vnder&s;tanding the noi&s;e and the voice of their companions, whome they e&s;t&eacute;emed dead or ta|ken pri&s;oners, determined to &s;et fire on the gates, while the re&s;t a&s;&s;ailed the towne: Wherewith euery man ranne to fetch wood, which the Alfarins perceiued, but to conclude, they could not &s;hun it, but whether they would or not, the draw-bridge and the gates were &s;et on fire: wherewith they were &s;o aba&s;hed, that mo&s;t part of them began to flie vnto the great temple of Iupiter, the principall place of &s;trength within their citty, the re&s;t &s;tay|ing behind, with full determination rather to die then &s;uffer the Chri&s;tians to enter the Towne. And &s;&eacute;eing the gates burnt downe, &s;o many of them ranne to fetch water, that not long af|ter the Chri&s;tians had meanes to a&s;&s;aile the towne on that &s;ide, which a&s;&s;ault continued &s;o long that day failed, yet could they not enter by rea&s;on of the great re&s;i&s;tance the Alfarins made, but the two knights that were aboue did them &s;o much hurt with blockes and &s;tones, that not any of them dur&s;t appeare, where|by the Chri&s;tians became mai&s;ters of the towne. Wherin great number of people, both men, women, and children, were put to the &s;word, and more had died had it not ben night, &s;pecially on the

Neuerthele&s;&s;e fearing lea&s;t the Alfarins &s;hould a&s;&s;emble a|gaine, and in the night they might bee repul&s;ed, hee commanded a retraict to bee founded, being well a&s;&s;ured the next day to haue the towne at their plea&s;ure. And for the &s;ame cau&s;e he &s;ent to the army on land that they &s;hould do the like: wherewith euery man retired, &s;etting watch in tho&s;e places where mo&s;t n&eacute;ed required.

I am much aba&s;hed then (&s;aied &s;he) how he &s;hewed him&s;elfe &s;o vncourteous in my behalf, not &s;peaking vnto me while I was in his company, yet me thin|keth being his pri&s;oner, hee could haue done no le&s;&s;e then com|fort m&eacute;e, either with good &s;p&eacute;eches or faire promi&s;es, whereof hee hath v&s;ed &s;o few, that while I liue I &s;hall neuer thinke well of him. Madame (&s;aied <HI>Carmelle</HI>) you take the matter otherwi&s;e then it is, for if hee refrained to &s;peake vnto you, it was by rea|&s;on of the great acquaintance hee perceiued <HI>Frandalo</HI> to haue with you, vnto whome he is &s;o great a friend, that hee was not

<PB REF="68">
<P><HI>_HEliaxe</HI> that had not &s;lept all that night, being gr&eacute;eued for the lo&s;&s;e of the towne of Alfarin, the ordinary abiding place of <HI>Alphorax</HI> her hu&s;band, and withall the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t delicious place of all Turkie, perceauing day to appeare, waked the two knights, making her account if &s;hee might get into the towne before the de&s;truction of the temple, the people that were fled into it, (by her reque&s;t and humble &s;upplication to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo</HI>) &s;hould bee &s;aued. With that they all mounted on their hor&s;es, and made &s;uch ha&s;t, that they entred into the town, as the Chri&s;tians began to a&s;&s;ault the fortre&s;&s;e, and when <HI>Frandalo</HI> per|ceiued the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> hee rode vnto her, bidding her God morrow, and taking her palfry by the bridle bareheaded, brought her to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his company that did her great honor, kno|wing her to be a kings doughter, and wife to &s;o great a Prince. With that &s;hee a&s;ked <HI>Frandalo</HI> which of them was <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> Madame (&s;aied hee, pointing vnto him) here he is ready to do you any &s;eruice that he can, as hee hath a&s;&s;ured mee. But when &s;hee perceiued him to bee &s;o yoong and of &s;o great beautie, &s;hee was a|ba&s;hed to think how nature had furni&s;hed him with &s;o many good perfections, e&s;pecially of &s;o great and incomparable force, wher|of he had the commendation among the mo&s;t valerous knights: wherewith &s;hee &s;aied vnto <HI>Frandalo,</HI> In good faith I haue heard him commended in diuers places for one of the be&s;t knights li|uing in the world, and of mine owne knowledge I haue &s;&eacute;en him doe that which I would neuer haue thought to bee in him, con&s;i|dering his yoong yeares, &s;o that if hee abound as much in courte|&s;ie as he doth in valour and beautie, I thinke him to bee the bra|ue&s;t Gentleman that may bee found: which I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;&eacute;e if he graunt me one reque&s;t. Madame (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> blu&s;hing at the prai&s;es &s;he v&s;ed in re&s;pect of him) If I doe it not, you &s;hall be the fir&s;t that euer I refu&s;ed gift vnto in all my life: and con&s;i|dering your great beautie and mo&s;t courteous behauiour, howe &s;hould it be po&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;obay your will? I pray you then &s;ir knight (&s;aid &s;he) to pardon the poore people that are within the
<PB REF="69"> Temple, and graunt them vnto mee, with leaue to &s;end them where I &s;hall thinke good, not hurting them any more. In good truth madame (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) you &s;hall not be refu&s;ed for &s;o &s;mal a matter, and I will doe &s;o much with the other knights, that they &s;hall giue con&s;ent, as al&s;o to your owne libertie and the Gi|ant <HI>Forons,</HI> to guide you where it plea&s;eth you, which <HI>Frandalo</HI> did mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire at our handes before you arriued here: And for his &s;ake looke what el&s;e you will command at our hands, wee are ready to performe it with all our hearts. For the which the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxe</HI> thanked him mo&s;t heartely, and turning to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> &s;aied vnto him: Sir Knight, the good that you and your companions doe vnto mee, &s;hall neuer bee forgotten on my part, but I will by all means &s;&eacute;eke to acknowledge the &s;ame, although pre&s;ently I cannot doe it: wherefore if it plea&s;eth you, cau&s;e your &s;ouldiours to retire, that the&s;e poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people may come forth according to your promi&s;e: In the meane time I will goe comfort them, for I am in doubt mo&s;t part of them are rather dead then liuing: with that &s;he de&s;ired <HI>Carmelle</HI> to bear her com|pany, they two going to the Temple gate, which they found fa&s;t &s;hut and rampired vp: then &s;h&eacute;e called &s;o lowd, that &s;ome of them &s;pake vnto her: but neuer did men by pardon from their Prince, brought backe againe from the Gibbet, more reioice, nor were better comforted then they when they knew her, thinking the prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> had made &s;ome agr&eacute;ement with their enemies. Wherefore they opened a little wicket, whereat &s;hee and the Gentlewoman entered into the Temple, they a&s;king the Prin|ce&s;&s;e howe it was her chaunce to come thether in &s;o good a time to &s;uccour them, that looked for no other fauour then mo&s;t cruell death. My friends (&s;aied &s;he) I haue done &s;o much with the Chri|&s;tians (by <HI>Frandalos</HI> meanes) whome I haue knowne long time, that they are content to let you i&s;&s;ue foorth, your liues &s;aued, and goe where it plea&s;eth you, and my &s;elfe likewi&s;e that had fallen into their hands as well as you: wherefore chu&s;e whether you will follow mee to Te&s;ifant where my lord <HI>Alphorax</HI> is, who for my &s;ake will &s;hew you all the fauor and courte&s;ie he may. When the poore people vnder&s;tood the agr&eacute;ement made for them by the
<PB REF="69"> Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> they all agr&eacute;ed to goe with her, and not for|&s;ake her, giuing her mo&s;t hearty thankes for the good &s;hee had wrought them. Then (&s;aied <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) let tho&s;e that haue armour put it off, and come all forth with mee. Then &s;he being accompa|nied in that manner, came vnto <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and &s;hewing him great numbers of women and little children that &s;tood about her, &s;aid vnto him: I pray you &s;ir knight behold the good whereof you are the cau&s;e, and thinke what domage it had beene if the&s;e poore &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lly &s;oules had &s;uffered death for no offence, wherein you are worthy great commendations. And yet (&s;aid &s;h&eacute;e, &s;miling) while I liue, I &s;hall not forget the &s;mall account you made of me when <HI>Frandalo</HI> and you found mee before my pauillion, after the ouer|throw of my knights. Wherefore madame (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian?</HI>) I maruaile (&s;aied &s;h&eacute;e) why you a&s;ke mee &s;uch a que&s;tion, &s;&eacute;eing you might well conceiue what gr&eacute;efe I had in mind, yet did you not &s;o much as once &s;alute me, or v&s;e word vnto mee: in good truth it was but di&s;courteou&s;ly done of you. Madame (&s;aied hee) I be&s;&eacute;ech you pardon mee, for the fault I committed in your behalfe, was not done for want of bringing vp, but fearing to br&eacute;ede &s;ome iea|lou&s;ie in <HI>Frandalos</HI> mind, &s;&eacute;eing him &s;o much affected to doe you &s;eruice, together with the good countenaunce you &s;hewed vnto him, although you had lo&s;t your men. This excu&s;e (&s;aid <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) is not to be accepted, neither &s;hal you e&s;cape &s;o ea&s;ily therewith: which &s;hee &s;pake with &s;o good a countenance, that her &s;&eacute;eming to bee offended, contented all the company: wherefore <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;aied vnto her, Madame, I am content to make amends for this great fault, or to doe what pennance it plea&s;eth you. The pen|nance (&s;aid &s;he) that you &s;hall haue &s;hall be, that according to the promi&s;e of mercy you haue made vnto the&s;e poore people, as al&s;o of fauour in mine owne behalfe, you giue vs leaue to go vnto the citty of Te&s;ifant to my hu&s;band, that for the &s;ame we thinke the better of you. Madame (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) you haue already vnder|&s;tood our minds, wherefore you may fr&eacute;ely go whether it plea&s;eth you, and I my &s;elf will be your guide if it be your plea&s;ure. With that <HI>Heliaxe</HI> gaue them many thankes, and taking her leaue, got vpon her palfrey, and being accompanied of <HI>Foron</HI> with a
<PB REF="70"> great number of the poore people, tooke the way that went to Te&s;ifant, <HI>Frandalo</HI> going with her aboue a league and more, and further would haue gone although hee were wounded in diuers places of his body, but &s;he de&s;ired him to go back againe. For (&s;aid &s;he) although like a good &amp; curteous knight you haue had y^e means not onely to &s;erue mee, but al&s;o to &s;aue the life of me and mine, it may bee I &s;hall not haue &s;o the like to doe the &s;ame for you if you fall into my lord <HI>Alphorax</HI> hands: who as I thinke ere now is aduerti&s;ed of my mi&s;fortune, whereby I am in doubt hee is al|ready in the field with great number of men to &s;uccour me. And if it &s;hould be &s;o, I know him &s;o impatient, that if hee m&eacute;et with you (being already moued with the lo&s;&s;e of Alfarin, as al&s;o the iniury my knights haue receiued, and my &s;elfe likewi&s;e as hee will &s;uppo&s;e) the plea&s;ure that you doe me would br&eacute;ed a danger to your per&s;on, and to me great gr&eacute;efe, wherefore I pray you goe no further, but turne backe againe. <HI>Frandalo</HI> knew her coun&s;ell to be good, wherewith hee committed her to God: leauing her in the guard of his cou&s;in <HI>Foron,</HI> and therewith returned the &s;ame way that hee came. It was then &s;omewhat late, wherfore <HI>Heli|axe</HI> hauing trauailed vnto the aduenturous fountain, and finding her pauillion as yet &s;tanding vp, determined not to depart from thence till the next day in the morning, that &s;hee tooke the way that led to Te&s;ifant. And hauing ridden till noone, &s;hee met the Prince <HI>Alphorax,</HI> with a great number of knights that all night had &s;taied vpon the way to the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> thin|king tho&s;e that had take~ his wife would lead her thether, to haue her in &s;afe k&eacute;eping, and &s;uch was their opinion that brought him newes thereof. But they met not any man in the way, wherfore they returned againe to go vnto the aduenturous fountain, much gr&eacute;eued when they perceiued the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxe</HI> comming to|wards them, to whom <HI>Alphorax</HI> ranne, and imbra&s;ing him with a louing ki&s;&s;e, a&s;ked her how &s;he had e&s;caped from the enemy. My lord (&s;aid &s;he) when I &s;hall haue told you how, yet am I in doubt you will hardly bel&eacute;eue it. And to &s;ay the truth, it &s;&eacute;emeth fortune hath taken plea&s;ure in one day to make mee know both the good and euill &s;hee could doe vnto mee. Then &s;hee &s;hewed him of the
<PB REF="70"> ouerthrow of her knights, the words that pa&s;&s;ed betw&eacute;ene <HI>Fran|dalo, E&s;plandian,</HI> and her: and la&s;tly the hone&s;t intertainement they v&s;ed in her behalfe.

My lords (&s;aid <HI>Frandalo</HI>) I pray you pardon me, I am well a&s;&s;ured that my valour is none &s;uch as you report, whereby I de&s;erue not the prai&s;e you giue me, neither did I euer any thing worthy commendation, but on|ly by my lord <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> meanes.

With that the Empre&s;&s;e accompanied with the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e,</HI> and diuers other la|dies and Gentlewoman came thether, to whom <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> doing humble reuerence, they bad him welcome, and becau&s;e hee &s;taied to doe <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> commendations to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> the Emperour &s;aid vnto him: Truly nephew, you &s;hall make an end, to &s;hewe vs what hath happened in your voiage, then if it plea&s;e you you may court the ladies. Wherefore I pray you tell from the beginning what you haue done. My lord (&s;aied he) at our departure from hence wee had &s;o good a winde, that without any let wee arriued at the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> yet could wee not make &s;uch ha&s;t, but that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> with his great Serpent, and <HI>Frandalos</HI> &s;hips had already drowned and ouerthrowne cer|taine of the enemies &s;hips, and made the re&s;t to flie, and the next day after king <HI>Armato</HI> was taken pri&s;oner, his army ouer|throwne and put to flight: but the &s;port was when I &s;aluted the Turke, and that hee knew mee, then hee told the great rage the Turke was in, the threatnings and &s;p&eacute;eches hee v&s;ed vnto him, the ouerthrow of the twenty knights at the aduenturous foun|taine, the &s;kirmi&s;hes and a&s;&s;aults at the Towne of Alfarin, the danger wherein <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and <HI>Frandalo</HI> found them&s;elues, the taking of the Towne and of <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> her deliuery with the peo|ples that fled to the temple of Iupiter, and how that before hee imbarked him&s;elfe to returne, a great &s;hippe arriued there from great Brittaigne with diuers knights therin, who&s;e names and &s;irnames he rehear&s;ed, as hauing &s;&eacute;ene them with king <HI>Amadis.</HI> Further my lord (&s;aid he) the good knight <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> willed me to &s;hewe you that hee k&eacute;epeth king <HI>Armato</HI> till your grace &s;hall di&s;|po&s;e of him, as al&s;o the citty of Alfarin, but for the ca&s;tle <HI>La mon|taigne defendu,</HI> hee &s;aith hee mindeth not to y&eacute;eld the &s;ame to any other then to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> in who&s;e name hee hath conquered it, hoping as her &s;eruaunt and no other to defend the &s;ame.

<PB REF="73"> &s;p&eacute;ed hee may (&s;aied <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI>) as hee hath promi&s;ed mee. In good faith (&s;aied the Emperour) I would it were this day before to+morrow, I haue &s;o great de&s;ire to knowe him by rea&s;on of the great chiualry that daily increa&s;eth in him, in &s;uch manner, that if heretofore the knight with the Gr&eacute;ene Sword hath b&eacute;en e&s;t&eacute;e|med the be&s;t in all the world, now his &s;onne dimini&s;heth a great part of his glory. And all being well con&s;idered, I thinke that <HI>Amadis</HI> hath not done more in tenne yeares time, then <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> hath accompli&s;hed in the &s;pace of tenne w&eacute;ekes: But tou|ching <HI>Frandalo,</HI> is hee &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to our &s;eruice as you make report? My lord (&s;aied <HI>Ga&s;tilles,</HI>) It is not po&s;&s;ible to doe bet|ter then he hath done: wherefore, my lord <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> willed mee to &s;hew you, that for the better entertaining him in his proc&eacute;e|dings, h&eacute;e is of adui&s;e that your grace &s;hould giue him the citty of Alfarin, not knowing any man worthier then hee to k&eacute;epe it. In good truth (&s;aied the Emperour) <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his companions haue had the paines to conquer it, wherefore I am content they haue the di&s;po&s;ing thereof: Neuerthele&s;&s;e, if they re&s;t vpon my con&s;ent therein, I am well content it &s;hall bee &s;o, and I will not cea&s;e to &s;hewe him greater fauour, if hee per&s;euer as hee hath begun. And you daughter (&s;aied hee to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI>) what &s;ay you to this that my cou&s;in <HI>Ga&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lles</HI> hath told you touching <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> that &s;ayeth hee k&eacute;epeth the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu</HI> for you onely? My lord (&s;aied &s;he) I know not how you and many others e&s;t&eacute;eme &s;o much of him, con&s;ide|ring the &s;mall obedience hee &s;heweth to his father, for if he were &s;uch a knight as hee is reported, hee had long &s;ince come hether to acquite the promi&s;e wherevnto hee is bound: which maketh mee verily thinke, the &s;p&eacute;ech <HI>Carmelle</HI> v&s;ed of him, and all that hee hath &s;ent you by word of mouth by my cou&s;in <HI>Ga&s;tilles,</HI> are onely but di&s;&s;imulations.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. How Frandalo accompanied of foure&s;core Knights, i&s;&s;ued out of Alfarin towards Te&s;ifant, and of the taking of Eiraca captaine of the Towne.</HEAD>
<P>_THe knights of great Brittaigne arri|ued in the Towne of Alfarin, (as you heard before) <HI>Frandalo</HI> and others that were hurt being healed of their wou~ds, <HI>Belleris</HI> that cea&s;ed not continually to hearken after <HI>Alphorax,</HI> was aduerti|&s;ed by his &s;pies, that hee continued in the citty of Te&s;ifannt, which hee and <HI>Branfil</HI> told vnto the re&s;t of their com|pany, who therewith being &s;omewhat incouraged, very earne&s;t|ly de&s;ired <HI>Frandalo</HI> to lead the~ forth, and bring them to &s;ome place where they might lie in ambu&s;h to &s;urpri&s;e <HI>Alphorax</HI> or &s;ome of his companie if they chaunced to &s;tray abroad. <HI>Frandalo</HI> not wil|ling to deny them any rea&s;onable reque&s;t, agr&eacute;ed (with the
<PB REF="74"> con&s;ent of <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) to depart the next night following, and to take with the~ to the number of foure&s;core knights and no more, which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> liked well, he minding to bee one. Where vpon tho&s;e that were appointed for the iourney prepared them&s;elues, and about &s;unne &s;etting i&s;&s;ued out of Alfarin, <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Belle|ris</HI> knowing y^e country &s;o well, that they n&eacute;eded no other guides, but trauailed &s;trait towards Te&s;ifant, and hauing ridden till ele|uen of the clocke at night, they came vnto a cro&s;&s;e way, where <HI>Frandalo</HI> adui&s;ed them to deuide them&s;elues in two companies, willing the knights (that before that time had neuer ben in Tur|kie) to hold clo&s;e together. For (&s;aid he) the warres in the&s;e coun|tries are far otherwi&s;e then they are in great Brittaigne, where knights v&s;e mo&s;t commonly to trauaile alone without compa|ny, and although they chaunce &s;ometimes to ride in companies, the lea&s;t occa&s;ion that happeneth maketh them &s;eperate them|&s;elues, but here tho&s;e that v&s;e armes trauaile in great companies together, whereby the combates that are fought here mo&s;t com|monly are rather battailes then incounters. And more then this, if thr&eacute;e hundred Turkes chance to &s;urpri&s;e one hundred, thirtie, twenty, or le&s;&s;e number of their enemies, they take a pride to put them to death, preferring reuenge before a certaine kind of honour, that (as I haue vnder&s;toode) is kept and ob&s;erued in the We&s;t parts, where combates are in a manner equall. Where|fore my friends (&s;aied he) I pray you &s;eperate not your &s;elues, but march all in a company, a&s;&s;uring you that in the place whe|ther wee goe, wee &s;hall not faile to finde men &s;ufficient again&s;t whome wee may imploy our forces, and &s;hewe what valour is in vs. I knowe that within halfe a mile of Te&s;ifant <HI>Alpho|rax</HI> v&s;eth oftentimes to lie at a hou&s;e that hee hath cau&s;ed to bee made called Gruobinach, where if it bee our good for|tunes wee may chaunce to finde him, wherefore I am of adui&s;e that we deuide our &s;elues in two companies, my nephew <HI>Belleris</HI> &s;hall take the left hand, and lie in ambu&s;h n&eacute;ere vn|to the village of Ientinomele, from whence hee may ea&s;ily perceaue when any man i&s;&s;ueth out of Te&s;ifant, and I with <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and the other halfe of our companie will followe
<PB REF="74"> this way that bringeth vs vnto a valley n&eacute;ere to Gruobinach, where we will &s;ecretly &s;tay if n&eacute;ed require, to &s;uccour each other: whereunto they all agr&eacute;ed: but before they departed thence, they found their enterpri&s;e to be far more dangerous than they e&s;t&eacute;e|med it, as hereafter you &s;hall heare. <HI>Belleris</HI> and his companie leauing <HI>Frandalo,</HI> trauailed &s;o long, that about two houres before day they met fixe &s;ouldiours, whome <HI>Belleris</HI> &s;aluted in the Ara|bian language, a&s;king them of what place they were. My Lord, &s;aid they, we are going to the towne of Sra&s;&s;e. My good friends (&s;aid he) we trauaile this night to Te&s;ifante to aduerti&s;e y^e prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> of the great dommage and de&s;truction the Chri&s;tian dogges continually doe and within &s;hort &s;pade haue done vnto y^e countrey round about: for they are i&s;&s;ued out of Alfarin, &amp; haue taken and carried away all they can find: and as yet are abroad, not cea&s;ing to execute all tyrannie they can deui&s;e: neuertheles, if it plea&s;eth him to giue vs aid, w&eacute;e know the place of their re|trait, where we may ea&s;ily inclo&s;e them, &amp; not one of them &s;hall e&s;cape. What are you, &s;aid the &s;ouldiours, that bring vs the&s;e newes? Friends (&s;aid <HI>Belleris</HI>) I am <HI>Rou&s;&s;an,</HI> cou&s;in to <HI>Eiraca,</HI> ehiefe captaine of Te&s;ifant. We can tell you good newes of him, &s;aid the &s;ouldiours, wherewith we thinke you will be well plea|&s;ed: for he is not farre from hence, being ridden out of Te&s;ifant with two hundred knights to goe vnto Falandie, to &s;&eacute;e the &s;ame be not &s;o lightly &s;urpri&s;ed as Alfarin was. But becau&s;e he willed vs to ride before, w&eacute;e will &s;tay no longer: wherewith they hadde them farewell. Friends (&s;aid <HI>Belleris</HI>) the good fortune I wi&s;h you I pray God may happen vnto you. With that the &s;ouldiours pa&s;&s;ed on their way, but they had not gone farre when <HI>Belleris</HI> &s;ent after them, and fearing they would di&s;couer his enterpri&s;e, cau&s;ed them to be &s;laine: and therewith pre&s;ently di&s;patched one of his Squires on me&s;&s;age to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> to aduerti&s;e him of the enemies b&eacute;eing abroad with a verie &s;trong and huge companie: whereupon h&eacute;e wi&s;hed him to ioyne with them. The Squire made all the ha&s;t h&eacute;e could, but before the newes came to <HI>Fran|dalo, Belleris</HI> met with <HI>Eiraca</HI> and his company about the vil|lage of Ientinomele, b&eacute;eing vpon them before they had time to
<PB REF="75"> put on their helmets. There did the captaine of Te&s;ifant &s;hewe him&s;elfe to be no yoong beginner in armes, for that like a valiant and hardy knight hee entered among the Chri&s;tians, and being &s;econded by his men, did mo&s;t valiantly defend them&s;elues, and a&s;&s;ailed the enemy, although at their fir&s;t encounter ten of their braue&s;t &s;ouldiours were vnhor&s;ed and ouerthrowne. And as <HI>Ei|raca</HI> entered into the prea&s;e, <HI>Norandel</HI> and he met together with &s;uch force, that <HI>Norandel</HI> was wounded in the left &s;houlder, but not &s;ore hurt, and the captaine of Te&s;ifant loo&s;ing his &s;tirrops, was throwne ouer his hor&s;e with &s;o great a &s;trength, that with the fall hee was forced to lie vpon the ground, and could remooue neither hand nor foote, which the Turkes perceauing, to rel&eacute;eue their captaine, did &s;o valiantly, that they ouerthrew foure of the Britti&s;h knights, who neuerthele&s;&s;e ro&s;e pre&s;ently againe, and with their &s;words in hand, thru&s;t &s;o many of the Turkes hor&s;es into the &s;ides and flanckes, that in &s;hort &s;pace more then twentie of the Turkes were ouerthrowne likewi&s;e, and many &s;lain out|right: at that charge <HI>Enil</HI> and <HI>Gauarte</HI> were hurt, and the re&s;t &s;o hardly handeled, that without <HI>Frandalos</HI> company that came to &s;uccour them, they had all beene ourthrowne: and in truth they had almo&s;t &s;traied too long, but the Squire that <HI>Belleris</HI> &s;ent vnto them, could not ouertake them before they were in the valey where they &s;hould haue met. And although they had heard the &s;ound of their blowes, yet did they not &s;u&s;pect any &s;uch perrill, vntill the &s;quire had done his me&s;&s;age, wherewith they ranne with all the &s;p&eacute;ed they could vnto the place, where <HI>Belleris</HI> and his companions (being out of breath) did nothing but recule, and defend them&s;elues again&s;t their enemies blowes, that had &s;laine diuers of them, but that the captain of Te&s;ifant would haue them to bee taken and pre&s;ented to the Prince <HI>Alphorax:</HI> Neuerthe|le&s;&s;e <HI>Frandalo, E&s;plandian,</HI> and the re&s;t of their company, made them change opinion: for when they perceaued their compani|ons &s;o hardly matched by the enemy, they entered among them with &s;uch fury, that had it not beene for <HI>Eiraca</HI> (who at that time behaued him&s;elfe mo&s;t valiantly) they had ouerthrown y^e Turks at their fir&s;t on&s;et, but by rea&s;on of the great re&s;i&s;tance hee
<PB REF="75"> made, they continued fighting halfe an houre after, wherein h&eacute;e maintained him&s;elfe &s;o well, that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> could neuer take him before h&eacute;e had ouerthrowne him, and pulled off his helmet, wherewith h&eacute;e y&eacute;elded: meane time <HI>Frandalo</HI> and his compani|ons being in the middle of the enemies, laide &s;o well about them, &s;laying hor&s;es, pulling away &s;hields, and doing &s;o valiantly, that woonder it was to behold them, yet did not the Turkes once &s;&eacute;eme aba&s;hed, but &s;till fought mo&s;t couragiou&s;ly, vntil &s;uch time they perceiued their captaine taken pri&s;oner, which cau&s;ed them to flie and turne their backes: but not all of them, for there lay more than one hundred and fiftie of them dead vpon the ground, the re&s;t &s;aued them&s;elues by meanes of the darke night. It was then about an houre before day: and <HI>Frandalo</HI> fearing that tho&s;e of Te&s;ifant (hearing of the ouerthrow) would i&s;&s;ue foorth to cut off their pa&s;&s;age, pre&s;ently cau&s;ed captaine <HI>Eiraca</HI> to be remoun|ted, and all the Chri&s;tians that wanted hor&s;es, and with all &s;p&eacute;ed rode backe againe to Alfarin, not the &s;ame way they came, but another way &s;omewhat farther about; wherein they trauailed &s;o long, that about &s;unne ri&s;ing they entred into a great woode, where they alighted to refre&s;h both them&s;elues and their hor&s;es: and &s;taying not long there lea&s;t they &s;hould b&eacute;e &s;urpri&s;ed, they made &s;uch &s;p&eacute;ed, that about &s;unne &s;etting they arriued in y^e town: meane time newes came to Te&s;ifant of the ouerthrowe of their men, wherewith <HI>Alphorax</HI> was in &s;uch a rage, that in a man|ner h&eacute;e &s;&eacute;emed de&s;perate.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. Of the great griefe E&s;plandian had, vnder&s;tanding by the me&s;&s;en|ger that Ga&s;tilles &s;ent vnto him, what di&s;plea&s;ure the Prince&s;&s;e Leonorine had conceiued again&s;t him.</HEAD>
<P>_YOV heard before how <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> &s;hewed the Emperour what <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had done, and what me&s;&s;age h&eacute;e &s;ent vnto him, and to the Prince&s;&s;e Leonorine, as al&s;o what an&s;were &s;he made, which <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> by his Squire writ and &s;ent vnto him, hauing charge from the Emperour &s;o to doe, thereby to procure his &s;p&eacute;edier arriuall in Con&s;tantinople. The Squire with his lether made &s;uch ha&s;t, that h&eacute;e arriued at Alfarin about fiue daies after the taking of <HI>Eiraca,</HI> and m&eacute;eting <HI>Carmelle</HI> at the gate, a&s;ked her if he might find <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> at conuenient lei&s;our to deliuer him a letter from <HI>Ga&s;tilles,</HI> but <HI>Carmelle</HI> being &s;ubtill, &s;u&s;pecting it to be &s;ome newes from the Prince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> that might mooue <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> who as then &s;&eacute;emed di&s;content, an&s;wered him &amp; &s;aid: My good friend, you can hardly &s;peake with him at this time, but follow me and giue me the letter, and I will pre&s;ent it vnto him, and cau&s;e him to returne you an an&s;were. The Squire did as &s;he willed him, and followed her to <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> lodging: where entring into his chamber, &s;he found him &s;itting vpon his bed tal|king with the king of Denmarke, and deliuered him <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> letter, which when he read, the teares ranne out of his eyes, and therewith ca&s;t forth a great &s;igh, &s;aying: O Lord? but <HI>Carmelle</HI> that beheld him, doubting the cau&s;e to be as &s;he &s;u&s;pected, a&s;ked him if he were ill at ea&s;e. Ill? &s;aid he, I that I am, and &s;o ill that I would to God I were dead: and looke I pray you, &s;aid he, whe|ther I haue cau&s;e or not: wherewith &s;tretching forth hish hand, he gaue <HI>Carmelle</HI> the letter, and turning his face, began to make the greate&s;t &s;orrow in the world: but when &s;h&eacute;e had read the con|tents, &s;h&eacute;e e&s;t&eacute;emed not thereof, but &s;aid vnto <HI>E&s;plandian:</HI> What
<PB REF="76"> my Lord? are you aba&s;hed at &s;o &s;mall a matter? By my &s;oule I now perceiue very well, that the affections and loues of men are farre different and much vnlike the pa&s;&s;ions that we &s;imple wo|men endure, when we fall into the like extremities: and knowe you how? you men doe mo&s;t commonly take plea&s;ure to manife&s;t and make known your loue either by word of mouth or outward &s;hewes, and many times di&s;&s;emble more than you meane to doe: and which is wor&s;e, how much the more the Lady or Gentlewo|man you loue is of great de&s;ert, or high linage, &s;o much more glo|ry doe you take to make it knowne, not onely that you beare her affection, but that you are beloued and fauoured of her aboue all others: which is cleane contrary to the nature of women (I meane &s;uch as may b&eacute;e tearmed wi&s;e and of good vnder&s;tanding) for how much the greater their parentage is, &s;o much more feare they haue to manife&s;t their amorous pa&s;&s;ions, in &s;uch manner, that mo&s;t commonly both in word, ge&s;ture, and countena~ce, they outwardly denie that which they haue mo&s;t d&eacute;epely engraued in their hearts and mindes: and not without good cau&s;e, for that the thing which redoundeth to your prai&s;e and commendations (as you think, which is the manife&s;ting of your loue) br&eacute;edeth to them a certaine &s;pot in their honour, which often times they can not ea&s;ily deface. Wherefore it is more than expedient, to ob&s;erue this mode&s;tie and con&s;tancie in vs, not that I meane to re&s;traine my &s;elfe vnto this lawe, &s;&eacute;eing that all my glory and felicitie de|pendeth vpon you, in &s;uch manner, that I de&s;ire no greater hap|pine&s;&s;e in this world, then that the loue and dutifull obedience I beare vnto you, &s;hould be publi&s;hed and made knowne vnto the world, to the end that all tho&s;e that &s;hall heare of your great va|lour and my meane e&s;tate, may know my great good fortune, to haue the meanes to &s;erue you as I doe. Wherefore my Lord, in my opinion you ought to take the &s;p&eacute;eches <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> hath written vnto you, to be v&s;ed by the lady <HI>Leonorine</HI> in good part and great|ly to your aduantage, for I dare warrant you on mine honour, that your affections are both alike: and to &s;ay the truth, &s;he hath behaued her &s;elfe mo&s;t wi&s;ely to di&s;&s;emble the matter &s;o well as &s;he hath done in the Emperors pre&s;ence. I deny not but &s;he hath
<PB REF="77"> &s;ome cau&s;e to be impatient, con&s;idering the me&s;&s;age I deliuered vnto her in your behalfe, but that is ea&s;ie to be cured: &amp; although the loue &s;h&eacute;e hath borne you &s;o long time &s;hould be wholly extin|gui&s;hed (which I can hardly bel&eacute;eue) euen as a bone that is bro|ken in two p&eacute;eces &amp; &s;et togither againe, is &s;tronger in that place than in any other part, &s;o you being there and in her companie, &s;hall winne that you finde broken, and by that meanes make it &s;tronger than euer it was before. Therefore I am of adui&s;e (that fulfilling her de&s;ire) you goe vnto her, and that as &s;oone as po&s;&s;ibly you may. Alas <HI>Carmelle</HI> (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) what good or what &s;er|uice did I euer doe vnto her, thereby to haue de&s;erued at her hands the lea&s;t fauour among an infinite number I haue recei|ued from her? &s;pecially by the report of your owne mouth. If therefore &s;hee hath iu&s;t occa&s;ion to be offended with me, hauing offended her &s;o much, can I hope for any other at her handes than m&eacute;ere di&s;daine and mortall hatred? My lord (&s;aid <HI>Carmelle</HI>) I am a woman and know the nature of women better than you doe, or then all the men in the world be&s;ides, I pray you there|fore bel&eacute;eue me, and go and &s;&eacute;e her, and if &s;o be &s;h&eacute;e entertaine you not according to your de&s;ire, then neuer giue credit to my words againe. In faith my good companion (&s;aid the king of Denmark) <HI>Carmelle</HI> giueth you &s;o good and wi&s;e coun&s;ell, that either you ought to giue credit to her &s;p&eacute;ech, or els wholly driue this fanta&s;ie out of your mind, con&s;idering (as is mo&s;t true) that &s;ometimes, and very often, how much the more feruent and extreme the loue of a woman is, &s;o much the &s;ooner is it dead and wholly extingui|&s;hed, for that their incon&s;tancie is &s;uch and &s;o great, that for the lea&s;t occa&s;ion in the world they are ouer ready to loue, and much more incon&s;iderately doe they forget the &s;ame againe: not that I accu&s;e the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> of &s;o great lightnes, but to &s;ay the truth as co~monly we find, &amp; for my part I know not vpon what occa&s;ion you ground your loue, wherby you &s;hould make &s;o much accou~t of her, &s;&eacute;eing y^t &s;he neuer &s;aw you, nor you her, but are on|ly content to conceiue well of ech other vpon a certaine renowm y^t hath &s;pred abroad, &amp; &s;et forth the great perfections y^t are repor|ted to be in you both: which in truth may b&eacute;e compared to a fire
<PB REF="77"> made of &s;traw, y^t is no &s;ooner kindled but pre&s;e~tly co~&s;umed: wher|fore be not then &s;o much aba&s;hed if y^e princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> &s;hew her &s;elfe at this pre&s;e~t &s;o &s;mally affected towards you, for tho&s;e y^t loue mo&s;t d&eacute;erly do oftentimes fall into di&s;curte&s;ies &amp; coldnes of affec|tion, that they di&s;daine, or (at the lea&s;t) in the twinkling of an eie, wholly forget tho&s;e that for a long time they haue loued mo&s;t in|tirely, &amp; that for their &s;akes &s;hal haue hazarded their liues in mo&s;t dangerous aduentures. Did you neuer heare how <HI>Bri&s;arde</HI> beha|ued her &s;elfe in regard of <HI>Troilus,</HI> after the de&s;truction of Troy, &s;h&eacute;e loued him &s;o well that &s;he would n&eacute;eds die in his armes: whe~ &s;he was con&s;trained to for&s;ake him, the Gr&eacute;ekes thinking verily &s;he would haue &s;laine her &s;elfe: &amp; yet was &s;h&eacute;e &s;car&s;e i&s;&s;ued out of Troy but &s;he wholly forgot her loue <HI>Troilus,</HI> &amp; tran&s;ported that vehement loue &s;he had borne him all her life, to <HI>Diomedes</HI> king of Thrace. O God? What incon&s;tancie? what lightnes? what foundation vpon a &s;andy grou~d was that? This vncon&s;tant wo|man among other precious ornaments giuen her by <HI>Troilus</HI> her friend, had a paire of perfumed gloues, which within one houre after her captiuitie &s;he gaue vnto her new friend <HI>Diomedes</HI> in to|ken of the loue &amp; amity &s;he bare vnto him. What had <HI>Troilus</HI> &s;aid then if he had b&eacute;en pre&s;ent? would he haue bel&eacute;eued her? I thinke not. And what a point of hone&s;tie, I pray you, did <HI>Clitemne&s;tra</HI> &s;hew vnto her hu&s;band, when in &s;t&eacute;ed of welcoming him home at his comming from the &s;iege of Troy, where he had remained ten y&eacute;ers togither? &s;he cau&s;ed him cruelly to be murdered by <HI>Egi&s;tus</HI> her ruffian. But will you heare more exa~ples of the like matter? &amp; as he began to proc&eacute;ed, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;aid vnto him, My good friend, I pray you do not this wrong vnto my lady <HI>Leonorine,</HI> but let me here your coun&s;ell how I may from henceforth gouerne my &s;elfe to &s;ati&s;fie her de&s;ire. Go &amp; &s;&eacute;e her, &s;aid y^e king, &amp; if you think good I will beare you co~pany. Shall we go &amp; leaue our co~panions?

My good friend (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) doe as you thinke good, I am content to hazzard my life in your hands. It &s;uffi&s;eth (&s;aid the king) but I pray you &s;peake vnto our companions, and di&s;|patch the &s;quire. With that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> called for inke and paper, and wrote vnto <HI>Ga&s;tilles</HI> as the king of Denmarke had adui&s;ed him. Next day in the morning <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the re&s;t of the com|panie came into his chamber as they v&s;ed ordinarily to doe, and being togither deui&s;ing of diuers things, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;aid vnto them: My good friends, I am con&s;trained to leaue your compa|ny for the &s;pace of fift&eacute;ene daies or three w&eacute;ekes, to goe about cer|tain vrgent affaires y^t import me much: I will take with me my brother the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin, Enil, Carmelle,</HI> and no more. I pray you thinke it not &s;trange, for if I were not con&s;trai|ned thereunto, I &s;weare vnto you of my faith, I would not do it. There was not any among them that once would a&s;ke him whe|ther he went, but an&s;wering him, &s;aid: That he might goe whi|ther it plea&s;ed him, &amp; that they for their parts would k&eacute;epe y^e place till he came againe, although he &s;taid a whol y&eacute;er before he retur|ned; by this means <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> by little &amp; little framed him&s;elfe to take his voiage while y^e king of Denmarke cau&s;ed the &s;hip that brought the knights of great Britain thither, to be made ready, &amp; vpon a monday in the morning <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &amp; his company imbar|ked them&s;elues to &s;aile vnto the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> but they were no &s;ooner put to &s;ea, but the wind falling contrary, the &s;ea ro&s;e &s;o high &amp; &s;o furious withall, y^t neither ma&s;t, &s;aile, nor cord could hold, but brake all in p&eacute;eces: in which maner they co~tinued
<PB REF="78"> for the &s;pace of tenne daies and as many nights, &s;o that neither mai&s;ter nor marriners could tell in what part they were, for that during that time, the clouds were &s;o thicke and the mi&s;t &s;o great, that it made the aire &s;o darke and ob&s;cure, that tho&s;e that were in the &s;hippe could &s;car&s;e &s;&eacute;e one the other, expecting nothing el&s;e (without the mercy of God) then the ouerthrow of their &s;hippe: which they thought verily had happened, when they arriued at the rocke of the Enchauntre&s;&s;e, wherevpon they were driuen a|bout thr&eacute;e of the clocke after midnight: wherewith the &s;aylers ca&s;t anker, and going on land, &s;taied till day appeared.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. How E&s;plandian and his company went vp vnto the broken pallace of the Enchauntere&s;&s;e, and of the &s;traunge thinges they found there.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_ESplandian</HI> and his company being on land, not knowing the place where they were arriued, cau&s;ed a great fire to bee made, about the which they thought to lie downe and &s;l&eacute;epe, but they heard &s;uch a noi&s;e from the top of the rocke, that they were all aba&s;hed: with that the winde be|gan to cea&s;e, and the &s;ea to waxe calme, the &s;kie &s;hewing full of &s;tarres, and withall the mone &s;hone &s;o bright, that it &s;&eacute;emed as light as if it had ben day: wherefore <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> de&s;irous to know what the noi&s;e might bee, determined to mount vp the rocke, but he was coun&s;elled by his company to &s;tay till the next day in the morning. When <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> knew it certainely to be the rocke of the Enchauntre&s;&s;e, and &s;aied vnto the king of Denmarke: In good truth I thinke I haue beene here before and take it to be the place whether the great Serpent brought me the &s;ame day I re|ceaued the order of knighthood, which putteth mee in better hope of our voiage then I had before: which he &s;aied, remembring the &s;croll with the prophe&s;ie that he found in the lions paw.

<PB REF="79"> the death of the &s;erpent, &amp; all y^t he had &s;&eacute;ene vpon the rocke, &amp; it is called (&s;aid he) the rock of the Enchauntre&s;&s;e.

But before hee did it, he determined fir&s;t to &s;peak with <HI>Carmelle,</HI> and taking her
<PB REF="81"> a&s;ide, &s;aied vnto her: My great friend, you know for what cau&s;e the king of Denmarke left vs, &amp; the rea&s;on of his voiage, as al&s;o the promi&s;e he made vnto me to returne again with all &s;p&eacute;ed, but we can heare no news of him at all, which maketh me a&s;&s;uredly bel&eacute;eue either hee is dead, or that the &s;torme hee was in hath ca&s;t him in &s;ome country &s;o far off, that he cannot by any meanes doe as he hath promi&s;ed, wherefore I pray you giue mee your adui&s;e what I were be&s;t to doe: for tho&s;e that are in the like mind that I am, although in &s;ome thinges they haue their vnder&s;tandings whole and perfect, yet are they commonly to &s;&eacute;eke in that which concerneth them as touching tho&s;e points.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. How E&s;plandian was put into the Cedar che&s;t, and with the tombe carried into the Prince&s;&s;e Leonorines chamber, and what confe|rence they had togither.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Emperour and his company gon as it is &s;aid before, <HI>Carmelle</HI> called <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> that in the meane time lay in the bottome of the &s;hippe, and told him the manner of their proc&eacute;edings, as al&s;o the &s;p&eacute;ech the Emperour had with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> &amp; all what had happened, as it is before re|hear&s;ed. By my &s;oule (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) I was neuer in the like paine, for hearing all you &s;peake, only the lady <HI>Leonorine,</HI> I could not tell what to thinke: but when y^e Em|perour told you &s;he was not in the citie, bel&eacute;eue me, it comforted my heart. Did not I play my part well? &s;aid <HI>Carmelle.</HI> That you did, and as well as one could wi&s;h, (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) and if it be true which is commonly &s;aid: That a good beginning makes a good ending, I hope I &s;hall not faile to bring my purpo&s;e to pa&s;&s;e. And while they deui&s;ed togither it waxed night, &s;o that the Empre&s;&s;e returned into the citie which <HI>Carmelle</HI> vnder&s;ta~ding, cau&s;ed <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> pre&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> to lie downe in the Cedar che&s;t, in &s;uch &s;ort, that the aire entred therein on all &s;ides, and couering it with the Azure and Chri&s;tall &s;tones, <HI>Gandalin, Enil,</HI> and their Squires tooke the tombe, and with the gentlewoman went out of the &s;hip and came vnto the palace, where they found the Lady <HI>Leonorine</HI> (b&eacute;eing already aduerti&s;ed of the goodly Pre&s;ent &s;ent her by <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) in great deuotion &s;taying for <HI>Carmelle,</HI> for it had b&eacute;ene tolde her, that in the euening &s;he would bring it to her lodging: wherefore &s;he had no &s;ooner e&s;pied it, but &s;he (with many
<PB REF="84"> other ladies and gentlewomen no le&s;&s;e curious to behold y^e &s;ame) met her in the hall. With that <HI>Carmelle</HI> (perceiuing her come) &s;tepped forward, and doing reuerence vnto her, &s;aid: Madame, y^e good knight <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;endeth you this Pre&s;ent, y^e not long &s;ince he conquered in the rocke of the enchantre&s;&s;e, according to y^e good fortune &amp; happy de&s;tiny aboue a hundred yeres pa&s;t prede&s;tinated of him: which he &s;endeth vnto you, expre&s;ly to giue you to vnder|&s;tand the great de&s;ire that daily more &amp; more increa&s;eth in him to be your faithfull knight. But before you proc&eacute;ed further, it is con|uenient you grant me two reque&s;ts: the one, that neither you nor any other &s;hall looke into the tombe vntill the morning that I re|turne againe with the keye to open a Cedar che&s;t, that you &s;hall find therin: the other, that after you haue opened it you &s;hall giue it me, to carry with me to the place, where my father k&eacute;epeth his hermitage, therein to bury the bones of <HI>Matroco</HI> that died a chri|&s;tian, as you haue vnder&s;tood. <HI>Carmelle</HI> my friend (&s;aid y^e princes) that am I content to doe: neuerthele&s;&s;e I am much aba&s;hed why <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> deferreth the time &s;o long before he commeth to &s;&eacute;e the Emperour. Madame (&s;aid &s;hee) I will tell you that to morrow: meane time, I pray you, determin where you will haue our men to &s;et downe their charge. In the great hall (&s;aid <HI>Leonorine</HI>) that my gentlewomen may &s;&eacute;e it at their ea&s;e. In faith madame, you &s;hall pardon me (&s;aid <HI>Carmelle:</HI>) this place is too open and ouer common to leaue &s;o precious a thing &s;tanding therein: I denie not to let them haue the plea&s;ure to behold it, but hauing &s;&eacute;ene it, for the more &s;afetie it &s;hall be &s;et into your owne chamber, wher|of you and none other &s;hall haue the keye. With that they that bare the tombe, entered into the hall and &s;et it downe till <HI>Leono|rine</HI> and the re&s;t of the gentlewomen had beheld it long: and if <HI>Carmelle</HI> had not b&eacute;ene there; a&s;&s;ure your &s;elues it had b&eacute;ene bet|ter vi&s;ited than it was: but &s;he would not depart from thence till it was &s;hut vp. Which done, taking her leaue, as &s;h&eacute;e went out &s;he tooke the Princes a&s;ide, and giuing her the keye of the che&s;t wherein <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> lay, &s;aid vnto her: Madame, I leaue you in this tombe two ine&s;timable trea&s;ures, although their difference be great, as you may will perceiue you being alone: for it is
<PB REF="85"> &s;ure, that vnder this keye lyeth the thing, y^t in all the world you mo&s;t de&s;ire to &s;&eacute;e: &amp; without &s;taying <HI>Leonorines</HI> an&s;wer, &s;he went out of the chamber, and with <HI>Gandalin</HI> and his company retur|ned to the &s;hip, leauing the princes in a maruellous doubt by rea|&s;on of the words &s;hee v&s;ed vnto her: &amp; there with did &s;o certainely per&s;uade her &s;elfe, that her friend <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> lay dead within the &s;ame, that &s;he was con&s;trained to cau&s;e all her gentlewomen to depart the chamber, only qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> that &s;taied to beare her company: with that &s;he threw her &s;elfe on her bed, &amp; almo&s;t drowned in teares, began to make the greate&s;t &s;orrow in the world. Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> aba&s;hed at &s;o &s;uddain alteration, knew not what to think, but perceiuing her gr&eacute;efe to increa&s;e &s;till more &amp; more, went vnto her and &s;aid: Madame, I pray you hide y^e cau&s;e of this &s;orrowe from me no longer, for I &s;weare vnto you of my faith, if by any means I may rel&eacute;eue the &s;ame, I will deale ther|in as for my &s;elfe. <HI>Leonorine</HI> that neuer cea&s;ed &s;ighing, could not an&s;wer her one word, but with much importance at the la&s;t an|&s;wered her and &s;aid: Alas my good friend, for Gods cau&s;e let me be in re&s;t, and let it &s;uffice you that you know, that I neuer was &s;o de&s;irous for to liue, as I am at this pre&s;ent to die. What Ma|dame? (&s;aid the Qu&eacute;ene) will you tell me nothing els? No, (&s;aid &s;h&eacute;e.) In good faith then (&s;aid the Qu&eacute;ene) you &s;hall do me wrong, and I &s;hall haue good cau&s;e to thinke the loue and fauour that in times pa&s;t you haue &s;hewen vnto me, to bee altogither fained: whereat I am much gr&eacute;eued, &s;&eacute;eing I haue borne &s;uch a mind to you, that I would neuer haue failed to hazard not only my honor but my life and &s;oule both for your &s;ake. When the princes heard her &s;peake with &s;uch affection, &s;he was &s;omwhat better a&s;&s;ured, and thereupon &s;aid vnto her: S&eacute;eing you are &s;o de&s;irous to know the cau&s;e, you &s;hall heare it pre&s;ently, vpon condition you &s;hall promi&s;e me to be a meanes rather to hinder my daies than any waies to further them, &s;&eacute;eing I am fully determined to die. You may yet well remember (&s;aid &s;he) the fir&s;t time y^t <HI>Carmelle</HI> came hither to bring vs newes of <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> &s;onne to the good knight with the gr&eacute;en Sword, that had commandement from his father (as &s;he &s;aid) to come hither to &s;erue vs in his place, according to
<PB REF="85"> the promi&s;e he had made vnto vs being in this court: &amp; <HI>Carmelle</HI> &s;aid, that for that cau&s;e onely <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had &s;ent her vnto Con|&s;tantinople, to giue the Emperour and vs to vnder&s;tand therof: but there were other matters in the wind, for &s;h&eacute;e came expre&s;ly to intreat me to be good vnto her ma&s;ter, who for the great loue and affection he bare vnto me, liued in the greate&s;t paine that po&s;|&s;ible could be. Whereupon it happened, that being vanqui&s;hed &amp; ouercome with an infinite number of rea&s;ons that &s;he made vn|to me, I confirmed in my heart, that which his renowme had al|readie imprinted in my mind; and there with determined for to wi&s;h more good to him that to my &s;elfe: not that I euer thought to commit any fault that might redound to my di&s;honour, but onely for the glory to haue &s;o worthy a knight readie at my com|mandement: whereby this fire did &s;o augment in me, that euer &s;ince I could not thinke on any other thing that vpon <HI>E&s;plan|dian,</HI> with who&s;e loue my mind hath b&eacute;ene to mooued, that his long ab&s;ence hath almo&s;t procured my death: yet the hope I had from day to day to &s;&eacute;e him, hath made me able to &s;u&s;taine my griefe with &s;o great patience, that neither you nor any other, as I thinke, could euer perceiue it in me. But as the Saylor on the &s;ea being in a tempe&s;t, thinking at length to arriue at &s;ome hauen for to &s;aue him&s;elfe, &s;uddainly m&eacute;eteth with a rocke that breaketh his &s;hippe in p&eacute;eces: &s;o I (mo&s;t vnfortunate Ladie) ho|ping by the pre&s;ence of him I &s;o much de&s;ire to &s;&eacute;e, to be at the end of my great &s;orrowe, am now fallen into the gulfe of de&s;pe|ration, con&s;idering the &s;p&eacute;ech which <HI>Carmelle</HI> v&s;ed to me, who &s;peaking &s;oftly, &s;aied in this manner: Madame I leaue you within this tombe two ine&s;timable trea&s;ures: the one is the thing that in all the world you mo&s;t de&s;ire to &s;&eacute;e: which maketh me verily thinke it can be no other thing than the dead bodie of <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and that (as it is very likely) h&eacute;e hath de&s;ired at his death to be brought vnto me to w&eacute;epe and lament ouer him, as I meane to doe during the terme of my life: which if it plea&s;eth God &s;hall not be very long. And &s;aying &s;o &s;h&eacute;e ca&s;t forth a great &s;igh, &s;owning in Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;es</HI> armes: who being aba&s;hed to hear the prince&s;&s;e v&s;e tho&s;e words &s;o far from y^e e&s;timation &s;he

Where with the Qu&eacute;ene &s;aid vnto her, What Madame, wil you throw the helue after &s;he hatchet? will you b&eacute;e holden for a foole, and loo&s;e the reputation that is &s;pread of you throughout y^e world? Where is the con&s;tancie, the mode&s;tie, and the wi&s;dome where|with you were woont to be adorned? Mu&s;t you for one word (which you mi&s;vnder&s;tand) forget your &s;elfe &s;o much? Suppo&s;e it were true that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;hould be dead, can you call him againe by this tormenting your &s;elfe? For Gods &s;ake be patient, and if the wor&s;t be, you may prooue if it be &s;o, and not fall into this kind of fanta&s;ie vpon your owne imaginations: <HI>Carmelle</HI> hath tolde you that the thing you mo&s;t de&s;ire in all the worlde is inclo&s;ed in this tombe: is it therfore to be &s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;hould not be aliue? Thinke you he is the fir&s;t man that hath done the like for his be|loueds &s;ake? This I a&s;&s;ure you, that although I breake y^e tombe and all that belongeth to it, I will pre&s;ently &s;&eacute;e what may b&eacute;e in it. Alas cou&s;in (&s;aid the Princes) I feare you will &s;&eacute;e it ouer &s;oone for me, for if he be dead (as I thinke he is) a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe I will beare him companie before it be day. I pray you (&s;aid the qu&eacute;ene) be not vnhappy before your time, but let me worke the feat: hold then (&s;aid <HI>Leonorine</HI>) here is the keye y^e <HI>Carmelle</HI> left me: which the Qu&eacute;ene tooke in her hand, and entring into the cha~ber where the tomb &s;tood, &s;he lifted vp the chri&s;tall plate; that done, &s;he &s;pake aloud, and a&s;ked if any bodie were within the &s;ame: <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> (to whom one houre &s;&eacute;emed a whole y&eacute;ere) &s;taying for that time, and hearing the Qu&eacute;ene &s;peake, an&s;wered pre&s;ently, and &s;aid: I Madame.

It is inough (&s;aied the Qu&eacute;ene) wherewith &s;hee lifted vp the &s;e|cond plate, and then opened y^e che&s;t where in he lay, and comming out he v&s;ed great reuerence to the Qu&eacute;ene, but as then he knew her not, till &s;he &s;aied vnto him: Sir Knight, it may bee you haue heard of m&eacute;e before this time, I am <HI>Minore&s;&s;e,</HI> that to deliuer my Lady and you from the great paine you both indure, hath taken you out of this your pri&s;on: Wherefore I pray you &s;tay here a while, till I returne againe.

You haue be wailed your knight <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> for dead, but neuer in all my life haue I &s;&eacute;ene a dead creature bu|ried that was &s;o faire, and of &s;o plea&s;ant countenance, as the dead man I haue found within the tombe: I pray you come and &s;&eacute;e it I be deceaued or not. When the Prince&s;&s;e heard the Qu&eacute;ene v&s;e tho&s;e words touching <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and to laugh withall with ioie, her heart leaped in her body, and ri&s;ing out of her bed, without &s;peaking any word, &s;he ranne pre&s;ently into the chamber, at the entery whereof, &s;hee e&s;pied him &s;hee had &s;o much lamented: who pre&s;ently kn&eacute;eled downe to ki&s;&s;e her hands.

I &s;ay not but y^e Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> did the~ wrong: and likewi&s;e, if any man would accu&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> of folly or in|con&s;tancy, I an&s;were him againe that &s;he is mo&s;t ea&s;ily to be ex|cu&s;ed both of the one and the other, for although &s;hee had neuer &s;&eacute;ene <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> before that time, &amp; that in rea&s;on &s;he &s;hould haue known him better before &s;he &s;hewed her &s;elfe &s;o priuat vnto him, you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e (as it is trew) that loue had of long time before &s;o well ingrauen him in her mind, y^t &s;he &s;ea&s;ed not to &s;&eacute;e him eue|ry day with her inward eies.

In that manner the two louers pa&s;&s;ed the night till day began to appeare: which qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> perceiuing, went to <HI>Leonorine</HI> and &s;aid vnto her: Madame, the &s;ecrete&s;t follies are alwaies be&s;t, it is almo&s;t day, and it may bee the Empre&s;&s;e may &s;end &s;ome one of her women, or come her &s;elfe in per&s;on to vi&s;it you, for that ye|&s;ternight very late it was told her you were not wel. I pray you giue this knight leaue to depart, and let vs &s;hut him in the che&s;t, as wee found him at the fir&s;t. Alas how hard were tho&s;e wordes vnto <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and no le&s;&s;e vnto the Prince&s;&s;e, who fore&s;&eacute;eing the daunger that might fall out if they were found together, &s;aid vnto him: My good friend, this happy night that hath fauou|red vs &s;o much, &s;hall cau&s;e you if you thinke good, to remember the promi&s;e you haue made vnto mee: I pray you let m&eacute;e &s;&eacute;e you againe as &s;oone as po&s;&s;ible you may. And as &s;hee ended tho&s;e words, the qu&eacute;ene y^t &s;tood as a &s;tout watch, heard &s;ome body come vp y^e &s;taires, wherwith being in great fear, &s;he told y^e princes <HI>Le|onorine,</HI> which made <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> pre&s;e~tly go into y^e other chamber, &amp; without hauing time to take any longer farewell, laid him&s;elfe

<P><HI>_ESplandian</HI> entered into his &s;hippe, and <HI>Carmelle</HI> being returned as it is &s;aied before, they determined not to &s;tay longer, fearing to be di&s;couered: wher|fore they cau&s;ed ankers to be hoi&s;ed, &amp; &s;etting &s;aile, made towards the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> but fortune by a great &s;torme and contrary wind ca|ried them another way, driuing them along the coa&s;t of Alfarin, where the wind cea&s;ed, they &s;ayling almo&s;t hard by the &s;hore, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant whe~ they e&s;pied
<PB REF="89"> among the rockes certaine hor&s;e and footmen fighting together: whereat <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> maruelled, and &s;aid vnto <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil:</HI> I pray you, &s;&eacute;eing w&eacute;e are arriued here at this in&s;tant, let vs goe &s;&eacute;e from whence the occa&s;ion of their combate proc&eacute;edeth, and if we may, helpe them that haue the iu&s;te&s;t quarrel.

By the faith of a knight (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) if you had con&s;idered the countrey where wee are, and that the lo&s;&s;e of one of our men is greater to vs then a thou&s;and others, if we were in Chri&s;ten|dome, you would not haue hazarded your &s;elues &s;o much: but
<PB REF="89"> what is pa&s;t, cannot bee vndone. And to the end wee &s;p&eacute;edend wor&s;e, let vs enter into my &s;hippe that &s;tayeth for mee. My lord <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> (&s;aied <HI>Belleris</HI>) Occa&s;ion is offered now vnto vs, and let him goe that refu&s;eth it, when time &s;erueth. You &s;&eacute;e the ouerthrow of the Turkes, which is &s;uch, that I certainely bel&eacute;eue, there is not one man left within the Towne. Where|fore I am of opinion, that wee ride thether in as &s;ecret manner as wee may, then if wee &s;&eacute;e occa&s;ion, wee will &s;et vpon the gates, and it may bee &s;hall enter the Towne without re&s;i&s;tance, meane time &s;end one of your Squires to certefie your &s;aylers, that they &s;aile vnto Alfarin, or el&s;e that they &s;tirre not from thence before they heare newes of vs. This coun&s;ell liked them well, and they all agr&eacute;ed vnto it: with that <HI>Belleris</HI> mar|ched on before, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and the re&s;t following after, ri|ding clo&s;e together vpon a Cau&s;ie, where not farre from thence they e&s;pied one &s;itting vpon a &s;harpe rocke mo&s;t hideous to beholde, whereat they &s;purred their hor&s;es thether to &s;&eacute;e what it might bee, where they &s;awe a woman &s;o olde, impotent, and withered, that her brea&s;tes hung downe beneath her nauill, apparrelled in a Beares &s;kinne, whereon hung her long, white, and knotted haire, where &s;hee had liued a|mong tho&s;e rockes in all tempe&s;ts and &s;tormye weathers for the &s;pace of &s;ixe&s;core yeares together. By which meanes, her naked bodie &s;hewed like the barke of an Elme tr&eacute;e or &s;ome an|cient Oke, whereby not one of them but began to laugh, a&s;|king <HI>Belleris</HI> if hee had heard of her before.

<P>_THe Chri&s;tian knights being met togither, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> a&s;ked <HI>Frandalo</HI> wherefore h&eacute;e rode abroad with &s;o great a company: My lord, &s;aid he, this morning I was aduerti|&s;ed, that <HI>Belleris</HI> my nephew had i&s;&s;ued by night out of Alfarin w^t certaine knightes, to &s;&eacute;e if they could m&eacute;et with our enemies, and fearing they &s;hould find &s;ome ambu&s;h laid for them that would be &s;tronger than them&s;elues, I told my lord <HI>Norandel</HI> your vncle, by who&s;e adui&s;e we tooke this way to followe him, but for that neither we nor you haue met with any company to prouoke vs to fight, I pray you let vs returne again the be&s;t way we can vnto Alfarin: but you my lord &s;aid he, what aduenture hath brought you hither in &s;o good time to find vs here?

If they were &s;orry it is not to be doubted, for that be&s;ides the lo&s;&s;e of their goods, they lo&s;t their wiues and children, thinking they &s;hould all be &s;ent pri&s;oners into a &s;trange countrey, whereat they were much gr&eacute;eued: but one Knight among the re&s;t b&eacute;eing a man of &s;ome &s;tomacke, perceiuing their &s;orrowe, badde them be of good courage, animating them in &s;uch &s;ort, that they all determined either to loo&s;e their liues or els to winne the towne againe: and therevpon (more mooued with rage than with rea|&s;on) they returned to the towne, and a&s;&s;ailed it in &s;uch furious and indi&s;crete manner, that a great part of them lo&s;t their liues in the a&s;&s;ault, b&eacute;eing repul&s;ed and driuen away by <HI>Frandalo, E&s;|plandian, Enil, Gandalin, Elian, Tiron,</HI> and tenne other of the mo&s;t principall Chri&s;tian knights: who to encrea&s;e more feare in the Galatians, i&s;&s;ued out of the towne and &s;lewe a great

But they had neither Barke nor Pinnace ready to &s;end, wherefore they were con&s;trained to take y^t where|in <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> came thither: which at that time (as fortune would) lay &s;till at anker &s;taying their plea&s;ure. Wherewith <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;ent <HI>Sergil</HI> to cau&s;e the &s;hip to come thither: which done, &amp; <HI>Gan|dalin</HI> ready to imbarke him&s;elfe, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> tooke him a&s;ide, &amp; &s;aid vnto him: Friend <HI>Gandalin,</HI> you haue alwaies b&eacute;ene faithfull &amp; tru&s;tie to my father, which giueth me cau&s;e to di&s;clo&s;e my &s;ecret vnto you before all others. When you come to Con&s;tantinople (&s;aid hee) you &s;hall &s;&eacute;e the Lady <HI>Leonorine,</HI> to whome you &s;hall pre&s;ent my mo&s;t humble commendations, &s;hewing her, that I will not faile very &s;hortly to accompli&s;h my promi&s;e and her co~|mandement, and withall you &s;hall pre&s;ent her the two &s;laues that were giuen me, which I &s;end to wait vpon her, that by their pre&s;ence &s;he may haue me in remembrance: and knowing you are not to learne how to v&s;e your &s;p&eacute;eches in &s;uch ca&s;es, I pray you <HI>Gandalin</HI> let me find in you that which I expect. My Lord (&s;aid he) God giue me grace to doe you &s;eruice. Then fare you well (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian.</HI>) With that <HI>Gandalin</HI> with all his charge entred into the &s;hip, and hauing &s;et &s;aile, had a good wind, that in &s;hort time after he arriued in Con&s;tantinople: where being lan|ded, he cau&s;ed two &s;quires to beare the pre&s;ents he had brought;
<PB REF="92"> and entring into the palace, he found the Emperor talking with diuers of his Noble men: the Emperor perceiuing him, went to imbrace him, a&s;king him where he had left the good knight <HI>E&s;plan|dian,</HI> and whether he meant not &s;hortly to come and &s;&eacute;e him. My Lord, &s;aid <HI>Gandalin,</HI> he commendeth him&s;elfe mo&s;t humbly vnto your Grace, and hath &s;ent you word by me, that not aboue fift&eacute;en daies pa&s;t, h&eacute;e, <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and others of our companie haue taken the towne of Galatie. Galatie? (&s;aid the Emperor) By y^e faith I beare to God, that is good newes: for as I haue b&eacute;en informed heretofore, it is one of the riche&s;t townes in all Turkie, but I know not well how they can k&eacute;epe it. Full well my lord (&s;aid <HI>Gandalin</HI>) &s;o it be your plea&s;ure to &s;end them &s;ome aid: otherwi&s;e they &s;hall bee con&s;trained in the end, either to abandon that to k&eacute;epe Alfarin, or Alfarin for that: which would b&eacute;e a &s;hame for them, and great dommage both to your Grace and all Chri&s;ten|dome. Haue they found great riches therein (&s;aid the Emperor) or haue they lo&s;t any quantity of their men? My lord (&s;aid <HI>Gan|dalin</HI>) &s;ome of the enemies were &s;laine in the taking thereof: and with that he began to &s;hew him the maner how it was done, and cau&s;ing the ca&s;es wherein the pre&s;ents were, to be opened, amo~g other things he &s;hewed him the images of <HI>Nabuchodono&s;ot</HI> king of A&s;&s;iria, of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, and that which he mo&s;t e&s;t&eacute;e|med, the true and liuely repre&s;entation of <HI>Hector</HI> of Troy, ar|med at all points, as he was when he fought again&s;t the Greci|ans: and &s;urely the Emperour had rea&s;on to make &s;o much ac|count thereof, for that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> was content to receiue it for his part, as being e&s;t&eacute;emed to be the riche&s;t iewell in all the citty of Troy, for that <HI>Hector</HI> him&s;elfe had cau&s;ed it purpo&s;ely to b&eacute;e made while the Grecians lay before the citie, by one of the cun|ninge&s;t workemen that could be found, and &s;et it vpon the chiefe gate of the palace of Ilion, which long time after fell into the hands of the kings of Turkie, that had erected it in the market place of Galatie, placing it vpon a high marble pillar, which <HI>Gandalin</HI> &s;hewed vnto the Emperour, as he hard reported in the country: wherewith the Emperour was &s;o well plea&s;ed, that h&eacute;e could not refraine to &s;ay: In good truth I &s;hould not be better
<PB REF="93"> plea&s;ed with the taking of the Citty of Te&s;ifante, then I am at this time with this goodly Pre&s;ent, and I pray you tell y^e knights that &s;ent it, y^t I thanke them for it with al my heart. My lord (&s;aid <HI>Gandalin</HI>) &s;o they did thinke it would b&eacute;e more acceptable vnto your grace the~ all the ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;iluer y^t they found with|in the Towne, part whereof they haue likewi&s;e &s;ent vnto you, that are in this other ca&s;e, which h&eacute;e pre&s;ently cau&s;ed to b&eacute;e ope|ned, and after they had peru&s;ed them, <HI>Gandalin</HI> cau&s;ed the two &s;laues that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;ent, to come n&eacute;erer, pre&s;enting them to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> &s;aying vnto her: Madame, the good knight <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> not knowing what greater Pre&s;ent to offer you (next vnto him&s;elfe) then the&s;e two yong maids, h&eacute;e &s;endeth them vnto you as your &s;laues, to the end euery man may know, that as you are the goodlie&s;t lady that euer nature framed, &s;o is there not any creature liuing on the earth, that better de&s;erueth to commaund &s;uch as command others, then your &s;elfe: wherefore if you &s;hew him the courte&s;ie to accept them at his hands, hee will e&s;t&eacute;eme it for one of the greate&s;t fauours that euer hee receaued. <HI>Leonorine</HI> that knew as well how to di&s;&s;emble her affections as any woma~ liuing on the earth: And de&s;iring to haue the &s;ame opinion, that alwaies had run of her, to continue &s;till, with a di&s;&s;embled kinde of anger, an&s;wered <HI>Gandalin</HI> and &s;aid: Sir knight, it &s;&eacute;emeth by your words, that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> is di&s;po&s;ed to mock me, and that you e&s;t&eacute;eme me to be a woman of light credite, could you of your faith thinke me &s;o very a child, that I &s;hould not well perceaue, (that if <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> were &s;o much at my commaundement as you &s;ay) hee would not haue deferred the time &s;o long to come hether vnto vs, were it only but to acquite the promi&s;e king <HI>Amadis</HI> his Father made vs aboue &s;ixe or &s;euen yeares pa&s;t. But I knowe his mind full well, h&eacute;e meanes to content vs with wordes, and many me&s;&s;ages that from time to time h&eacute;e &s;endeth, together with an infinite number of excu&s;es, but all to no purpo&s;e, wher|of while I liue I will not accept one of them for his di&s;charge: let him therefore come him&s;elfe, and then it may bee I will be|l&eacute;eue that to b&eacute;e in him, I haue &s;o oftentimes heard reported. When the Emperour heard her &s;peake in that &s;ort, hee &s;howed
<PB REF="93"> by his countenaunce that h&eacute;e tooke great plea&s;ure at his dough|ters choler, and &s;aied vnto her: My &s;w&eacute;et friend, what wil <HI>Gan|dalin</HI> &s;ay to &s;&eacute;e you &s;o vncourteous towards him, that honoureth you &s;o much: I pray you &s;w&eacute;et heart moderate your colour, and take that h&eacute;e &s;endeth, for if you refu&s;e it, h&eacute;e &s;hall haue great oc|ca&s;ion to di&s;like thereof: And you &s;&eacute;e that for your &s;ake hee dooth &s;o many valiant acts, that the good knight with the Gr&eacute;ene &s;word could neuer doe the like. My lord (&s;aied &s;hee) I bel&eacute;eue for valour h&eacute;e is not inferiour vnto his father, but for courte&s;ie his father &s;urpa&s;&s;eth him. In faith Madame (&s;aied <HI>Gandalin</HI>) if you knew him as well as I doe, it may b&eacute;e you would commend him more then now you bla&s;pheame him, &s;&eacute;eing that if hee hath deferred the time to come hether, it is onely becau&s;e hee thin|keth h&eacute;e hath not as yet done &s;ufficient in armes, whereby hee &s;hould de&s;erue one &s;parke of fauour at your handes, con&s;idering your e&s;tate and the &s;mall valour that is in him, although at this day h&eacute;e is e&s;t&eacute;emed the be&s;t knight that euer bare armes for the&s;e hundred yeares. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, &s;&eacute;eing you accu&s;e him of that, that ought mo&s;t to excu&s;e him, I promi&s;e you of mine honor, lea|uing all thinges apart, pre&s;ently vpon my retourne hee &s;hall come hether vnto you, to doe what&s;oeuer it &s;hall plea&s;e you to commaund him. <HI>Gandalin</HI> (&s;aied the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI>) thinke not (what&s;oeuer I &s;ay) that I either take plea&s;ure or di&s;plea&s;ure at his pre&s;ence or his ab&s;ence, but onely as my Father dooth, and I for his &s;ake, knowing the great loue and affection h&eacute;e hath alwayes born to King <HI>Amadis</HI> his Father, and continueth the &s;ame to his &s;onne. But hereof am I well a&s;&s;u|red, that h&eacute;e cannot &s;o excu&s;e him&s;elfe, or make vs thinke o|ther, then that herein h&eacute;e hath done vs wrong. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, &s;&eacute;eing it is the Emperours plea&s;ure, I will k&eacute;epe the Pre&s;ent h&eacute;e hath &s;ent m&eacute;e, vppon the promi&s;e and a&s;&s;urance you haue made of his comming hether as &s;oone as you &s;hall bee arriued at Galatia. Truely <HI>Leonorine</HI> played her part, very cunningly herein: for hardly would it haue b&eacute;en thought or once imagined, that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and &s;hee had &s;o faithfully giuen their handes and harts as they had done in the pre&s;ence of qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e,</HI> as you
<PB REF="94"> heard before, and <HI>Gandalin</HI> for his part knew not what to think, although he had borne <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> in the tombe, and &s;et him in hir chamber as you likewi&s;e heard. Then the Emperour a&s;ked him how long h&eacute;e meant to &s;tay. My lord (&s;aid <HI>Gandalin</HI>) as little as I may, for it were not fit for me to line at re&s;t, while my co~panions are in armes: Wherefore I mo&s;t humbly be&s;&eacute;ech your grace to giue m&eacute;e my di&s;patch as &s;oone as po&s;&s;ible you can. <HI>Gandalin,</HI> (&s;aied the Emperour) I will pre&s;ently &s;end for my admirall, &amp; wil cau&s;e men in al ha&s;t to be prepared, that within &s;ixe or &s;euen daies they &s;hall b&eacute;e ready to depart. With that hee went into the Garden to recreate him&s;elfe, and the Ladies with him: where when <HI>Gan|dalin</HI> perceiued <HI>Leonorine</HI> in an herbor of Mirtle tr&eacute;es, walking pen&s;iuely alone, hee went vnto her and &s;aied: Madame, my lord <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> commanded mee to certefie your grace, that &s;ince the time hee departed from you, and that he receiued &s;o great fauour at your handes, his heart (that wholly is yours) hath &s;o longed after you, that hee hath thought to die a thou&s;and times with gr&eacute;efe, for the lo&s;&s;e of your pre&s;ence. And to &s;ay the truth, I haue knowne many men troubled with the pa&s;&s;ions of loue: but I certainely bel&eacute;eue there was neuer his like, nor that more wi&s;e|ly could di&s;&s;emble it, which maketh mee greatly to doubt his per&s;on. For that it is impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the gr&eacute;efe hee &s;till indureth, together with the &s;mall comfort hee receiueth of his familiar friends, (not knowing his di&s;ea&s;e) but that hee mu&s;t in &s;hort time end his daies: whereby great dommage &s;hould then ari&s;e vnto all Chri&s;tendome, con&s;idering the &s;traunge be|ginning of Knighthoode and great Prowe&s;&s;e that is in him: which is &s;uch, as that if hee continue as hee hath begun, he will bring that order in greater e&s;timation then euer it hath b&eacute;ene before: wherefore Madame, &s;&eacute;eing I haue alwaies (as it may bee you are alreadie aduerti&s;ed) beene a &s;eruaunt to his father, and that I am acquainted with the nature of his &s;onne, and the daunger wherein hee is like to fall into, if you &s;hewe him not &s;ome fauour, I haue pre&s;umed to &s;hewe your Lady&s;hip the hard ca&s;e wherein he was when I left him, as al&s;o that hee hath expre&s;&s;ely commaunded mee to a&s;ure you,
<PB REF="94"> that his only intent and de&s;ire is to be in your pre&s;ence. Yet per|ceiuing the danger wherin his companions do remain, he know|eth not what excu&s;e to make, whereby he might take occa&s;ion for to leaue them: wherfore he be &s;&eacute;echeth you to impute his long ab|&s;ence vnto fortune, and not to him that is born only to loue, &s;erue, and obay you. In vttering whereof <HI>Gandalin</HI> &s;hewed &s;o &s;orrow|full a countenance, that hee made <HI>Leonorine</HI> ready to w&eacute;epe, In which kind of office hee had &s;o well ben exerci&s;ed from his youth, that no man could &s;urpa&s;&s;e him in the &s;ame. Friend <HI>Gandalin</HI> (&s;aid y^e prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI>) I know not what you mean I &s;hould do for him more then already I haue done, nor yet for what cau&s;e you &s;hould imagine that I &s;&eacute;eke to be the means of his death: &s;&eacute;e|ing that if he were but &s;ick, I know my &s;elfe &s;o f&eacute;eble and impati|ent, that with gr&eacute;efe &amp; &s;orow I &s;hould not be able to liue one hour after. Let it therfore be far from you, once to thinke that I would euer be any other mans then only his: and think it not &s;trange, if in the Emperors pre&s;ence, or before the world, I di&s;&s;emble as I do, for I would not in any ca&s;e, that the lea&s;t inckling of the bur|ning loue wherein my heart continually flameth towards him, &s;hould as yet bee once perceiued, ch&eacute;efly for the great good I wi&s;h vnto him. Madame (&s;aid <HI>Gandalin</HI>) I am well a&s;&s;ured hee will re|ceiue an extream plea&s;ure to hear the&s;e newes, and y^t he wil leaue all things to come hether, if you thinke it good. That is my de&s;ire (&s;aid &s;he) and I pray him &s;o to do, and you to per&s;uade him there|vnto. While they were deui&s;ing, <HI>Tartarie</HI> the admiral (&s;o called of the place of his birth) entred into y^e garden: being a man i&s;&s;ued of a mean hou&s;e, but aduanced vnto great authority by his great wit &amp; valiant courage, &s;o that he commanded ouer all y^e Grecian &s;eas. The Emperor and h&eacute;e talked long time touching <HI>Gandalins</HI> me&s;&s;age, concerning aid to bee &s;ent vnto Galatia, and in the end he willed in all ha&s;t to prepare thirty gallies &amp; Foi&s;tes, with two thou&s;and of the be&s;t &s;ouldiers he could find to man the &s;ame. The admirall <HI>Tartary</HI> according to his charge, executed his commi&s;&s;i|on in &s;uch &s;ort, that within &s;ixe daies after he was ready with his nauie to &s;et &s;aile, and depart from thence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. How Vrganda arriued at Galatia, and of the danger wherein &s;hee was by the &s;ubtletie of Melie the Enchauntre&s;&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>_THe admirall <HI>Tartarie</HI> and <HI>Gandalin</HI> ha|uing taken their leaues of the Emperor, &s;et &s;aile, and pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traights of Con|&s;tantinople, and without any aduentures, arriued at Galatia within one w&eacute;ek after their departure: if they were wel receiued by the Chri&s;tian knights, it is not to be doubted, for their number was &s;o &s;mall and &s;o di&s;per&s;ed, that they were in doubt to bee able to k&eacute;epe that Towne, with Alfarin, and the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu.</HI> But when they &s;aw &s;uch aid, they were in better hope, and hauing re|ceaued the admirall, they deuided their two thou&s;and men, as n&eacute;ed required. Mean time <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had no &s;mall de&s;ire to know of <HI>Gandalin</HI> if he had &s;poken with the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> &amp; how &s;he did: for the which cau&s;e being in his chamber, h&eacute;e &s;ent for him. Where talking together, <HI>Gandalin</HI> &s;hewed him from point to point what &s;p&eacute;eches had pa&s;&s;ed betw&eacute;ene the Prince&s;&s;e and him, not only before the Emperour, but al&s;o in the garden. And of my faith &s;ir (&s;aied h&eacute;e) you do her wrong, con&s;idering the good meanes you haue both to &s;ati&s;fie her and your &s;elf: for what excu&s;e &s;oeuer you can make, you are not &s;o &s;ore charged on this &s;ide, that you may not &s;pare &s;ome time to goe and &s;&eacute;e her, which &s;hee craueth at your hands. That I wil doe (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) but I mu&s;t find the meanes; take you care for y^t (&s;aid <HI>Gandalin</HI>) and let me go &s;l&eacute;epe, for I neuer had more n&eacute;ed: Goe (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) &amp; be here again betimes in the morning. Wherewith <HI>Gandalin</HI> tooke his leaue, leauing <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> alone in great care how hee might find &s;ome conuenient excu&s;e to leaue his companions in y^e extreamity, but God prouided for him: for y^e &s;ame night about an hour before day as he began to &s;lumber, he heard a mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;ound of mu&s;ick,
<PB REF="95"> which you mu&s;t vnder&s;tand, came out of the great &s;erpent y^t hee left in the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> which at y^e time was arri|ued before the town of Galatia, but little did he thinke of any &s;uch thing, or y^t <HI>Vrganda</HI> had ben therein, becau&s;e he thought her to b&eacute;e in great Brittaine. This mellody continued for the &s;pace of half an houre and more, which done, he heard &s;uch a noi&s;e of trumpets Clarigals, Phifes, and Tabers, y^t &s;ounded &s;o high, y^t the &s;entinels of the town thought verily the enemies nauy had ben arriued be|fore the &s;ame to lay &s;iege vnto it: wherevpon they cau&s;ed an ala|rum in the town, each man running to the wals, being all of that mind till day, when they might be hold the great &s;erpent (wherein <HI>Vrganda</HI> was) all hung with long pennons and &s;treamers: wher|at <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was &s;o glad, that going downe vnto the Hauen, hee pre&s;ently entered into a boat with <HI>Talanque, Manely,</HI> and diuer&s;e other of the principall captaines to &s;&eacute;e who might bee there. And rowing n&eacute;ere vnto it, they knew <HI>Vrganda</HI> that &s;taied for them on the hatches, &amp; &s;tretching forth her armes, &s;pake vnto them &amp; &s;aid: My good friends, you are mo&s;t hartily welcome, I pray you come vp into my &s;hip, y^t I may imbrace you. With that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> ente|red, and as he meant to &s;alute <HI>Vrganda,</HI> &s;he kn&eacute;eled on the ground to ki&s;&s;e his f&eacute;et, whereat he being a&s;hamed tooke her vp, and &s;aied vnto her: Madame, I neuer thought you would haue take~ plea|&s;ure to mock with me, &s;&eacute;eing I account my &s;elf much more bound to you then to any creature liuing in the world. And therfore for Gods cau&s;e, if at any time I chaunce to offend you, puni&s;h mee I pray you in &s;ome &s;ort or other.

My good friends (&s;aied &s;hee) you &s;hal know it at &s;ome other time when better lai&s;ure &s;erueth: mean while I am to tell you that it is nece&s;&s;ary for you &s;hortly to go vnto the city of Con&s;tantinople, where you &s;hall enter all ar|med &amp; apparelled in y^e &s;ame armor I haue brought hither for you,
<PB REF="96"> and thus mu&s;t I tell you, that if you &s;hould deferre it till another time, it would be preiudiciall to you all. Wherfore I coun&s;el you to do it vpon the fir&s;t day of the next w&eacute;eke, a&s;&s;uring you to be as well receiued of the Emperor, as euer were any knights, which your ea&s;e and plea&s;ure in his company, &s;hall continue vntil y^e rol|ling wh&eacute;ele of Fortune turning about, &s;hall bring with it manie trauels, pa&s;&s;ions, and aduentures, which &s;hal cau&s;e many gr&eacute;efes and &s;orrowes both to you and others. And the better to make you bel&eacute;eue that all I &s;ay is true, I tell you that I my &s;elfe &s;hall fall into two of the greate&s;t dangers of my life that euer I had, whe|ther it bee here or in another place I knowe not.

Madame (&s;aied <HI>Manely</HI>) Is it not your plea&s;ure to goe into the Towne? I (&s;aied &s;he) and I pray you &s;end for <HI>Norandel,</HI> who at this pre&s;ent I knowe is at Alfarin, and I wil giue you as great cau&s;e to reioice as euer you had: for that within my &s;hippe I haue brought the king of Den|marke, wounded in a combate that hee fought again&s;t <HI>Garlante</HI> Lord of the I&s;le of Calafre, that by force would haue taken two Gentlewomen from him. And although <HI>Garlante</HI> bee e&s;t&eacute;emed a hardy and valiant knight, yet did the king bring him in &s;uch ca&s;e, that vnle&s;&s;e hee had craued mercy, the king would haue &s;tricken of his head: which he &s;pared vpon condition, that during his life hee &s;hould neuer after iniury any knight, which <HI>Garlante</HI> &s;ware and vowed in my pre&s;ence, for that by chance arriuing there, du|ring their combate, I heard what pa&s;&s;ed betw&eacute;ene tham. And be|cau&s;e I perceiued the King to bee in danger of his per&s;on by rea|&s;on of y^e great number of wounds he had vpon his body, I would not leaue him, but cau&s;ed him to enter into my &s;hippe, and layed him in the be&s;t bed, where now h&eacute;e is almo&s;t healed. Ha (&s;aied <HI>E&s;|plandian,</HI>) What good newes are the&s;e, of my faith I thought
<PB REF="96"> verily he had ben dead: wherefore madame, I pray you for Gods cau&s;e let m&eacute;e craue the means to &s;&eacute;e him: with y^e <HI>Vrganda</HI> led him where he lay, but when they &s;aw each other, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> could not refraine w&eacute;eping, with the great plea&s;ure h&eacute;e took to &s;&eacute;e the king. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, for y^t time they had no great &s;p&eacute;ech together, nei|ther would <HI>Vrganda</HI> permit them to do it, doubting lea&s;t the king (being yet but weake and f&eacute;eble) might therby b&eacute;e hindered of his health. Wherefore &s;he cau&s;ed <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> to go forth, and entring with her into y^e boat, they rowed to the &s;hoare, from whence they led <HI>Vrganda</HI> to the be&s;t lodging in the town, with as much honor as they could haue done to the Qu&eacute;enes <HI>Bri&s;enne</HI> or <HI>Oriane,</HI> if any of the~ had ben there in pre&s;ence. The next day <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> pitying the great number of women &amp; little children y^t had ben kept with|in the town from the time y^t it was take~, &s;aid to his companions, that it would be better to giue them leaue to depart from thence, then to hold them &s;til, for y^e the longer they continued in y^e town, the more charge they put them to: &amp; to k&eacute;ep them pri&s;oners (&s;aied he) or in longer &s;eruitude, God may po&s;&s;ible be offended with vs. Wherfore if you wil bel&eacute;eue me, v&s;ing rather mercy then rigour towards them, I am of opinion y^t we &s;end them al to Te&s;ifant to the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> who wil thank vs for it, &amp; &s;o &s;hal we be ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;o much charge. To this al the knights agr&eacute;ed, &amp; <HI>Carmelle</HI> was appointed to execute the me&s;&s;age, &amp; he y^t had &s;&eacute;en the great number of people y^t were about her, e&s;pecially women, w&eacute;eping mo&s;t bit|terly to behold them&s;elues bani&s;hed &amp; driuen from their own hou|&s;es, &s;urely he could not chu&s;e vnle&s;&s;e he were hard harted, but haue pittied their e&s;tate. But let them goe, &amp; let vs heare what danger fell vnto <HI>Vrganda</HI> the next day after, who being welcome to the knights, took great plea&s;ure to hear them &s;hew of the aduentures they had found in the Turki&s;h countrey, &s;ince the taking of Alfa|rin. And each man after the other di&s;cour&s;ing what they knewe, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> remembred the old woman they had &s;&eacute;ene among the rocks, where &s;he continued, wherat he could not chu&s;e but &s;mile, which <HI>Vrganda</HI> e&s;pying, a&s;ked him the cau&s;e.

<HEAD>CHAP. XL. How Carmelle arriued at Te&s;i&s;ante, and &s;pake with Heliaxe, and of the maruellous combat which E&s;plandian, Frandalo, Ganda|lin, and Enil fought again&s;t three Gyants and twelue Turki&s;h knights.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_CArmelle</HI> trauelled &s;o long with the women and children of Galatia, that they arriued at Te|&s;ifant, where they found both their fathers and hu&s;bands as many of them as had &s;aued them&s;elues, as it is &s;aid before. E&s;t&eacute;eme I pray you what gr&eacute;efe they had to thinke vpon their exile, and lo&s;&s;e of all their goods: Surely there is no heart &s;o hard, but would haue wept with gr&eacute;efe to be|hold great numbers of men and women, with diuers litle chil|dren about them, and not hauing any meanes to giue them bread or drinke. Whereof the Prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> hauing newes, &amp; hea|ring of their &s;orow, could not refraine to &s;ay in pre&s;ence of them all. Ah immortall gods, it mu&s;t n&eacute;eds be, that either for &s;ome great &s;inne of me or mine, this cruell warre is mooued in my countrey: O gods immortall, let your wrathes appea&s;e, and of your infinite goodnes let it rather plea&s;e you that all the mi&s;chiefe which you &s;end vpon tho&s;e impotent people fall only vpon m&eacute;e that alone haue mooued your indignations: if not, then I be&s;&eacute;ech you giue me grace, that to your glory I may driue the&s;e cur&s;ed Chri&s;tians (enemies of your holy lawes) out of my countrey, &s;wearing vnto you, that if you vouch&s;afe your aides, I will make &s;o great a &s;laughter of them, that thereby your wrathes &s;hall b&eacute;e appea&s;ed, if it be &s;o that the &s;mall indeauour I haue hither to v&s;ed to driue them hence be the occa&s;ion of your anger towards me. Then h&eacute;e a&s;ked them how they got away. My Lord (&s;aid h&eacute;e that brought him newes) a faire gentle woman named <HI>Carmelle</HI> (as I heare &s;ay) hath brought them hither, and de&s;ireth to &s;peake with you and the prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxe.</HI> Ladie (&s;aid <HI>Alphorax</HI> to his

Lady (&s;aid <HI>Alphorax</HI>) I am wel con|tent therewith. With that &s;ome of them ran to fetch <HI>Carmelle,</HI> who being come in pre&s;ence of <HI>Alphorax,</HI> went pre&s;ently vnto the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Heliaxe,</HI> and without &s;alutation, &s;aid vnto her: ma|dame, you know the lord and mai&s;ter that I &s;erue, who only hath aucthority ouer me, think it not therefore &s;trange, if in any &s;ort I haue not humbled my &s;elfe before the prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> or to you: And to the end Madame, that you &s;hould knowe the cau&s;e of my arriuall here, I thinke the taking of Galatia is not vnknowne vnto you, whereof at this pre&s;ent the Chri&s;tians are Lords and mai&s;ters, hauing conquered it from you by force, not finding any Garri&s;on therein, but a number of women and little children: which my lord <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &amp; his company &s;end vnto your grace, committing them vnto your good di&s;cretion. A&s;&s;uring you (their Religion onely excepted) they are ready to doe you any &s;eruice that they may. <HI>Carmelle</HI> (&s;aied the Prince&s;&s;e) this is not the fir&s;t fauour they haue &s;hewed vnto me, I am of long time &s;o much be|holding to them, that bee it in their aduer&s;ities or their pro&s;peri|ties, I will neuer bee vnmindfull of the &s;ame. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, I am a&s;&s;ured, that at this day I haue not, neither yet &s;hall euer haue the meanes to doe it, (as I thinke) vnle&s;&s;e that variable fortune turne her rouling wh&eacute;ele, and aba&s;e them as much as now they are aduaunced, then (if it &s;o fall out) they &s;hall full well perceaue, howe much I e&s;t&eacute;eme their vertues and fauours they haue &s;howne vnto mee. <HI>Carmelle</HI> (&s;aied <HI>Alphorax</HI>) haue they willed you to deliuer no me&s;&s;age vnto mee? No my lord (&s;aied &s;hee) but I tell you plaine, they are determined verye &s;hortly to come and vi&s;ite you, in &s;uch manner, as will not greatly like you. By all my gods (&s;aied <HI>Alphorax</HI>) I will ea&s;e them of that burthen, if they make not the more ha&s;t. For I haue &s;o many men preparing, that I meane to goe in per&s;on to Con&s;tantinople to de&s;troye the wicked Emperour
<PB REF="99"> and all the Chri&s;tians. Then &s;hall my wife haue meanes (if &s;hee thinke good) to acknowledge the fauours towards them, which they haue &s;howen vnto her, as &s;hee &s;ayeth. My lorde (&s;aid <HI>Carmelle</HI>) Mens enterpri&s;es doe oftentimes fall out con|trarie to their expectations, and God that is in Heauen a|boue, commaundeth and di&s;po&s;eth of all thinges as it plea&s;eth him, and not as wee would haue it. Nowe Madame (&s;ayed &s;hee to <HI>Heliaxe</HI>) I haue done the commaundement of tho&s;e that &s;ent mee hether, wherefore I be&s;&eacute;ech you let mee be &s;afely con|ducted to the place from whence I came. My lord (&s;aid the prin|ce&s;&s;e to <HI>Alphorax</HI>) I pray you &s;hewe her &s;o much fauour, for it would gr&eacute;eue m&eacute;e much that &s;h&eacute;e &s;hould receaue the lea&s;t iniurie in the world, which hee graunted vnto her: and withall <HI>Heli|axe</HI> gaue her for her paines one of the riche&s;t gownes &s;hee had. Wherewith &s;hee cau&s;ed her to bee conducted by twenty knights vnto the Towne of Galatia: where being arriued, &s;hee &s;hew|ed them what &s;hee had done, as al&s;o what &s;p&eacute;eches the Prince <HI>Alphorax</HI> v&s;ed vnto her, which <HI>Vrganda</HI> marked well, &s;aying vnto the Knights: In faith my good friendes, as touching <HI>Al|phorax</HI> high woordes, they are the fruites of his nature, being altogether prowd and arrogant: Neuerthele&s;&s;e, I can a&s;&s;ure you, that fortune promi&s;eth him great matters. And becau&s;e it will not bee long before they doe happen, I will nowe v&s;e no wordes of them: Praying &s;ome of you to &s;hewe mee &s;o much fauour to retourne againe vnto <HI>Melies</HI> caue, to fetch her Bookes that w&eacute;e left behind vs. Which being in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, it may bee they will &s;erue hereafter to doe both you and manie others plea&s;ure. <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> hearing <HI>Vrganda</HI> &s;peake with &s;uch affection, and knowing the de&s;ire &s;hee had to haue the bookes, an&s;wered her and &s;aied: Madame, before I &s;l&eacute;epe I will &s;&eacute;e if I can fulfill your plea&s;ure. And without longer &s;taying, hee de&s;ired <HI>Enil, Frandalo,</HI> and <HI>Gandalin,</HI> to beare him company: who pre&s;ently armed them&s;elues, and being on hor&s;e|backe without any other companye then their owne Squires, i&s;&s;ued out of the Towne, leauing <HI>Vrganda</HI> with <HI>Norandel,</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI. How E&s;plandian entred into Melies caue, to fetch her bookes, and of an a&s;&s;ault made vpon him, Frandalo, Enil, and Gandalin, as they thought to returne againe vnto Galatia.</HEAD>
<P>_THe combat ended as you heard before, ech man cau&s;ed his woundes to be dre&s;&s;ed and bound vp in the be&s;t manner they could: then <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> entred into <HI>Melies</HI> caue to fetch the bookes he &s;ought, where h&eacute;e went into a faire chamber b&eacute;eing foure &s;quare, about the which there grewe &s;o much Iuie, that it might verily be iudged to haue b&eacute;ene placed there for the hangings of the chamber: in this chamber at ech corner there hung foure lampes, that burnt both night and day and neuer went forth, &s;o cunningly could the Enchantre&s;&s;e &s;hew her Art in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> place: and as <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> loo|ked well about him, he e&s;pied the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> of another chamber, in the middle whereof &s;tood a great candle&s;ticke all of ma&s;&s;ie gold with &s;euen branches, and in euery branch a waxe candle that burned continually: hard by it &s;tood a Cypres table, whereon lay <HI>Me|lies</HI> bookes, &s;ome couered with plates of gold and grauen vpon it, others with &s;iluer, bound and embo&s;&s;ed round about, which <HI>E&s;|plandian</HI> tooke and carried with him out of the caue, giuing them to k&eacute;epe vnto his &s;quire, and mounting on their hor&s;es, they rode the &s;ame way they came, thinking pre&s;ently to be at Gala|tia againe. But they were &s;tayed &s;ooner than they looked for, for the Turkes that fled away (as you heard before) made an alarme at a little towne not farre from thence, whereby there i&s;&s;ued twenty hor&s;e and fortie footmen, who being a&s;&s;ured that foure knights onely and no more had ouerthrowne their men, made all the &s;p&eacute;ed they could to inclo&s;e them, &s;pecially tho&s;e that were wel hor&s;ed: <HI>Frandalo</HI> and his company perceiued them a farre off yet could they hardly &s;hunne them, but of force mu&s;t fight, or els
<PB REF="101"> endure the &s;hame to flie away. Wherefore <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was in mind to trie their fortune, and to &s;end one of their &s;quires in all ha&s;t vnto Galatia, to aduerti&s;e them of the danger they were in, that they might &s;uccour them: whereto <HI>Frandalo</HI> would not giue con&s;ent, &s;hewing what great paine and trauaile both they and their hor&s;es haue endured all that day, as al&s;o the great number of their enemies in regard of them, in &s;uch &s;ort (&s;aid he) that if we take vpon vs for to fight with them, I am in doubt, that thin|king to winne honour, we &s;hall be counted ra&s;h and pre&s;umptu|ous fooles. What then? (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) will you endure the &s;hame to flie away? In good truth (&s;aid he) for my part I had ra|ther endure the hazzard of life or death, what euer &s;hall happen. Then we will doe thus (&s;aid <HI>Frandalo:</HI>) my &s;quire &s;hall runne vn|to Galatia to aduerti&s;e <HI>Talanque</HI> and the re&s;t how we &s;taied be|hind. Meane time, I know a bridge not farre from hence, whe|ther w&eacute;e will goe and defend the &s;ame, till our aid &s;hall come, where we cannot be a&s;&s;ailed by them all at once: otherwi&s;e thinke with your &s;elfe what meanes we haue to re&s;i&s;t &s;o many men both on hor&s;e and foot, that come purpo&s;ely to a&s;&s;aile vs. Let vs goe then (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) wherewith leauing the way on the right hand, they turned to the left, as <HI>Frandalo</HI> ledde them: and they had not ridden very farre but they came vnto a little riuer &s;omewhat d&eacute;epe, ouer the which there &s;toode a bridge, where they had no &s;ooner arriued, but they were pre&s;ently charged by their enemies, e&s;pecially by one of the Turkes that was mo&s;t braue and &s;umptuous, and be&s;t mounted of them all, as b&eacute;eing their captaine: who bearing a great launce in his hand, began to crie mo&s;t vehemently in the Arabian tongue vnto <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his companions, &s;aying: You dogges, you flye away, but by our gods it &s;hall co&s;t you all your liues: wherewith <HI>Enil</HI> that heard his threatnings better than the re&s;t, turned his face, and &s;et &s;purres to his hor&s;e, the Turke and h&eacute;e m&eacute;eting &s;o fiercely togither, that <HI>Enil</HI> was hurt in the right arme, and the Turke thru&s;t cleane through the body, wherewith hee fell pre&s;ently &s;tarke dead vnto the ground: Which &s;et his companions in &s;uch a rage to &s;&eacute;e their champion thus &s;uddainly &s;laine, that they
<PB REF="102"> thought to inclo&s;e <HI>Enil,</HI> but he found means to recouer the bridge: &s;urely who&s;oeuer had &s;&eacute;en the great prowe&s;&s;e of tho&s;e four cham|pions, might with good rea&s;on e&s;t&eacute;eme them as they were, &s;peci|ally <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> that &s;troke not one blowe in vaine. And although they were but fewe in compari&s;on of their enemies, yet they did twice or thrice ouerthrow diuers of the Turkes that &s;&eacute;emed bol|de&s;t to aduenture forward, in &s;uch &s;ort, that had it not b&eacute;ene for the footemen that came vpon them, the hor&s;emen had but little preuailed: whereat it is not to be maruailed, becau&s;e the greate&s;t part of them were citizens, altogither vnexpert in armes, and fitter to banket at a table than to guide a hor&s;e or breake a lance: whereby in le&s;&s;e than a quarter of an houre the foure knightes had done them great hurt: and &s;o much, that neither the hor&s;e|men nor footmen dur&s;t once &s;et forward to enter vpon the bridge, till one of them determined to make proofe, thereby if it were po&s;|&s;ible to inclo&s;e them round about. This Turkes name was <HI>Tlu|acam,</HI> a valiant and hardy knight, as he well &s;hewed before the combat ended: for although the water was d&eacute;epe and the other &s;ide hard to clime vp, yet he waded through, and at diuers times bare eight more of his companions ouer: which <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the re&s;t perceiuing, they were con&s;trained to deuide them&s;elues, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> &s;taying at the end of the Bridge where the combat fir&s;t began, <HI>Frandalo</HI> and <HI>Gandalin</HI> &s;tanding at the other, and God knowes what trouble they had, for <HI>Tluacam</HI> de&s;irous to winne honour or to loo&s;e his life, with his lance in hand, char|ged <HI>Gandalin</HI> in &s;uch &s;ort, that both man and hor&s;e had like to fallen to the ground, and withall he brake his &s;peare: wherfore taking his &s;word in hand, &s;triking on both &s;ides, and thinking to be &s;econded by his fellowes, put his hor&s;e in &s;uch a fury, that whe|ther he would or not he bare him to y^e middle of the bridge: where thinking to &s;tay, the hor&s;es f&eacute;et &s;lid from him, whereby both h&eacute;e and his ma&s;ter fell into the riuer and were drowned: whereat the Turkes gaue &s;o great a crie, that they &s;&eacute;emed madde, and bowing downe their heads thinking to acquite their lo&s;&s;e, v&s;ed all the force they could on both &s;ides the bridge to enter vpon the foure knightes: who &s;u&s;teined their a&s;&s;ault &s;o brauely, that the
<PB REF="102"> Turkes at la&s;t were forced to recule, wherof nine were thrown into the water, but <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his company were &s;o weary, that in a manner they could fight no longer. With that they per|ceiued their aid in all ha&s;t comming towards them: the occa&s;ion why they &s;tayed &s;o long was becau&s;e <HI>Frenace, Frandalos</HI> &s;quire, that went to &s;&eacute;eke <HI>Manely</HI> and the re&s;t, thinking to find his ma|&s;ter where he left him, had led them thither, but not finding them there, &s;uppo&s;ed them to be gone vnto the bridge: and to &s;ay truth, they arriued in very good time, for that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his thr&eacute;e companions were almo&s;t cleane out of breath: but when they perceiued their aide, neuer did poore pri&s;oners that were &s;et at li|bertie more reioyce, nor were better plea&s;ed: and the Turkes on the contrary &s;ide neuer more a&s;toni&s;hed, yet they held clo&s;e togi|ther, determining rather to reuenge their deathes than once to y&eacute;eld vnto their enemies: &s;o that before the Knightes of Galatia could enter in among them, they gaue them much to do, although in the end they ouercame them, whereby not one e&s;caped aliue, to carry newes vnto their friends. <HI>Enil</HI> at the fir&s;t on&s;et had b&eacute;en &s;ore wounded, as you heard before, wherefore h&eacute;e cau&s;ed his wounds to be &s;earched: the like did the re&s;t of the hurt knights. Which done, they &s;et forward to Galatia, contenting them|&s;elues for that day with the victory it had plea&s;ed God to &s;end them. And comming to the gate, they found <HI>Vrganda</HI> readie to receiue them: who knowing how all had pa&s;t, and the daunger wherein <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> had b&eacute;en, ie&s;tingly &s;aide vnto him: In faith my Lord, &s;aid &s;h&eacute;e, if I were afraid of death when I fell into <HI>Me|lies</HI> hands, I bel&eacute;eue you were not in much better ca&s;e &s;ince that I &s;aw you la&s;t, as I vnder&s;tand by tho&s;e that know what dom|mage you were in. Madame (&s;aid he) I know I am a mortall man, and that my life and death are in the hands of God, as it plea&s;eth him to di&s;po&s;e, and I confe&s;&s;e vnto you, if w&eacute;e had not b&eacute;ene &s;uccoured, that in the end we could not haue endured: yet am I well a&s;&s;ured, that before it had come to pa&s;&s;e, we had laid &s;o many enemies on the ground, that the re&s;t &s;hould haue had grea|ter cau&s;e to lament their lo&s;&s;e, than boa&s;t of their conque&s;t. <HI>Vr|ganda</HI> perceiued by <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> words that he liked not her &s;p&eacute;ech,
<PB REF="103"> whereupon &s;hee &s;aid vnto him: My Lord, pardon me I be&s;&eacute;ech you, and excu&s;e the indi&s;cretion of a woman, &s;pecially in m&eacute;e, who at this pre&s;ent had forgotten my &s;elfe. Madame (&s;aid <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI>) you may command me, and likewi&s;e &s;et me forth for a cow|ard, hardy, or any other what it plea&s;eth you to tearme me.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLII. How the Knights of great Brittaine that were at Galatia imbarked them&s;elues with Vrganda in the great &s;erpent, to &s;aile vnto Con|&s;tantinople, and what happened vnto them.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Knightes that had b&eacute;en hurt at the la&s;t encounter, for the &s;pace of fift&eacute;ene daies after were forced to k&eacute;epe their chambers vntill their woundes were healed: during which time, <HI>Vrganda</HI> tooke great plea&s;ure in reading <HI>Melies</HI> bookes which <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> cau&s;ed to b&eacute;e brought vnto her: wherein &s;h&eacute;e found &s;uch wonderfull coniurations and deui|&s;es of Magicke Art, that &s;he was aba&s;hed how &s;h&eacute;e that had had them &s;o long time in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, knew no more than yet &s;h&eacute;e did, e&s;t&eacute;eming the Enchantre&s;&s;e Lady to haue b&eacute;en the perfecte&s;t &s;chollar that euer &s;tudied in that art, as it well appeared by her bookes. Now the time approched wherein it was expedient (ac|cording to the de&s;tinies appointed) that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his com|panions &s;hould goe vnto Con&s;tantinople: wherefore as &s;oone as their wounds were healed, <HI>Vrganda</HI> cau&s;ed them to b&eacute;e a&s;&s;em|bled, and &s;tanding in the midde&s;t of them all, &s;he &s;aid vnto them: My good friends, knowing part of the pro&s;perities and aduer&s;i|ties which the heauens fore&s;hewe vnto you all, I came hither
<PB REF="103"> &s;pecially to &s;&eacute;e <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and you, of whome I haue receiued great pleat plea&s;ure, perceiuing at my arriuall the loue and ami|tie that is among you, with the great de&s;ire you haue to accom|pli&s;h the order of knighthood: not for the glory and recompence of this world, but onely for the increa&s;ing of our faith and the &s;eruice of God, that &s;hall reward you for it: and to the end you may continue in this forwardnes, and that the thing which I pretend, may happily fall out, I will from henceforth not only imploy my per&s;on but my Arte, which hath plea&s;ed God to lend me, wherewith I will adui&s;e you what I &s;hall find conuenient and nece&s;&s;arie for the augmentation of your honours alreadie &s;pread throughout the world: which to begin I am of opinion, that you all imbarke your &s;elues with me in the great &s;erpent, that &s;hall bring vs vnto Con&s;tantinople to the Emperour, for without him it is impo&s;&s;ible that this great enterpri&s;e you haue taken in hand can come to good effect: as al&s;o that hee him&s;elfe before many y&eacute;eres are pa&s;t, &s;hall be found in maruellous nece&s;|&s;itie, and &s;uch, that he &s;hall account him&s;elfe mo&s;t happie to haue your aid: and with good rea&s;on, for that in the end both hee and you &s;hall ouercome tho&s;e hazzards according to your de&s;ires. Then &s;hall you plainely knowe, that this that I fore&s;hew vnto you is mo&s;t true. While <HI>Vrganda</HI> v&s;ed the&s;e wordes, all the com|pany &s;tood &s;till intentiue for to heare her: and had it not b&eacute;en that they e&s;t&eacute;emed her words to be mo&s;t true, they had doubted of the threatnings &s;h&eacute;e v&s;ed again&s;t the Emperour, he b&eacute;eing &s;o great and pui&s;&s;ant a Monarch. Neuerthele&s;&s;e the i&s;&s;ue of that trou|ble which &s;h&eacute;e a&s;&s;ured vnto them, gaue them &s;ome ea&s;e and con|tentation of minde: in expectation whereof, they made account in the meane time to prooue their &s;trengths and forces, that thereby their valour and magnanimitie might be further &s;pread abroad. And as touching their voiage to the Emperour, as <HI>Vr|ganda</HI> gaue them direction, it was onely the thing wherevnto <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> did a&s;pire, hoping that if the warres were openly proclaimed in the Grecian Empire, and the Emperours daun|ger &s;o imminent, to &s;hewe &s;uch valour and prowe&s;&s;e in martiall exploits, that h&eacute;e would not onely fr&eacute;e and acquite his father
<PB REF="104"> of the promi&s;e he had made to &s;erue the Ladies, but confirme the loue that the princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> bare vnto him, in &s;uch &s;ort, that he might obtaine her for his wife: which cau&s;ed him to &s;peake for all his companie, a&s;&s;uring <HI>Vrganda</HI> that not one of them but was readie to obey and goe where it plea&s;ed her. My friends (&s;aid &s;he) then I pray you to morrow in the morning cau&s;e your hor&s;es to be &s;hipped in my &s;hippe, and for armour take you no care, I will prouide you thereof &s;o well, that ech man &s;hall find him&s;elfe con|tent: let it &s;uffice you to imbarke your &s;elues and &s;et &s;aile: for of|ten times an enterpri&s;e deferred ouer long, falleth not out as me~ de&s;ire it &s;hould, not for want of good and wi&s;e coun&s;ell, but by the neglige~ce of tho&s;e that are appointed to execute the &s;ame. Thus was their voiage to Con&s;tantinople agr&eacute;ed vpon, in &s;uch &s;ort, that all the knights of great Brittaine entred into the great &s;er|pent, taking with them <HI>Frandalo, Melie,</HI> and the captaine of Te|&s;ifant that had b&eacute;en taken pri&s;oner, as you heard before, leauing the Admirals &s;ouldiers for garri&s;on in the towne. Which done, the &s;hip went forward of it &s;elfe, &s;ayling towards the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> where being arriued they tooke <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turkie and his two captaines with them: for <HI>Vrganda</HI> wil|led them &s;o to doe: and &s;ixe daies after, the great &s;erpent arriued within halfe a mile of Con&s;tantinople, where &s;he &s;taied. Then <HI>Vrganda</HI> cau&s;ed her Knightes to be armed with the armour &s;h&eacute;e had brought, which were white, with a red cro&s;&s;e both before and behind, mo&s;t comely to behold. They were in all fortie knights, who&s;e names are as followeth: <HI>E&s;plandian, Frandalo, Norandel, Talanque, Manely</HI> the wi&s;e, <HI>Ambor</HI> of Gandel, <HI>Grauate</HI> of the fearfull valley, <HI>Gandalin, Enil, Trion</HI> cou&s;in to qu&eacute;ene <HI>Briolanie, Brauor</HI> &s;onne of the giant <HI>Balan, Belleris, Elion le delibere, Lico|ran</HI> of the white Tower, <HI>Li&s;toran</HI> of the &s;iluer bridge, <HI>Landin</HI> of Sariaque, <HI>Imo&s;il</HI> of Burgondie, <HI>Ledadrin</HI> of Ferraque, <HI>Sarqui|les</HI> cou&s;in to <HI>Angriotes, Palomir, Branfil, Tantiles</HI> the proud, <HI>Gal|bron</HI> &s;onne of <HI>I&s;amel, Carpin</HI> his brother, <HI>Carin</HI> of Carante, <HI>Atta|lio</HI> &s;onne of <HI>Oliuas, Bracele</HI> &s;onne of <HI>Bandoyuas, Garamante</HI> &s;onne of <HI>Norgales, Amphinio</HI> of Almain, <HI>Brandonie</HI> of Fraunce, <HI>Pena|trie</HI> of Spaine, <HI>Flamene</HI> his brother, <HI>Cul&s;picio</HI> of Bohemia,

Being arriued, the &s;hippe was pre&s;ently e&s;pied by the citizens which they knewe, hauing &s;&eacute;ene it before when it put them in &s;uch feare, as you haue heard, but hoping for him that v&s;ed ordinarily to &s;aile therein, they all ranne vnto the walles, and along the &s;hore to &s;&eacute;e him land: wher|with the noi&s;e and rumour was &s;o great, that the Emperour had newes thereof b&eacute;eing as then talking with the ladies. Tho&s;e newes plea&s;ed the Princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> &s;o well, that &s;he no &s;ooner heard the great &s;erpent named, but &s;he ro&s;e vp and went vnto the windowes to &s;&eacute;e if &s;h&eacute;e could e&s;pie her loue <HI>E&s;plandian:</HI> but the &s;hip was &s;omewhat too farre off, neither did it mooue from the place whereas it lay. Wherfore fearing to be deceiued as &s;he had b&eacute;en before, &s;he began to change colour: which Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> perceiued, and ie&s;ting &s;aid vnto her: Madame, doe you make this pitifull countenance to di&s;&s;emble the ioy you haue conceiued, or for feare I &s;hould beguile you of him that commeth to &s;&eacute;e you? How now cou&s;in (&s;aid &s;he) how long haue you learned to mock? In faith I neuer thought vpon the fir&s;t of tho&s;e two points, and much le&s;&s;e am I in doubt of the &s;econd, for you know as much as my &s;elfe, and yet I am not ignorant that when the great &s;erpent was there where I now behold it, he whome we expect came not thither, wherefore I feare (and with good rea&s;on) that w&eacute;e &s;hall now be &s;erued in like &s;ort: and as &s;he ended her &s;p&eacute;ech, the &s;hippe came within a bow &s;hot of the hauen where they might perceiue one of her &s;ides to open, from whence they put out a boat, and not long after they &s;aw <HI>Carmelle</HI> and two other gentlewomen come forth, the two gentlewomen playing mo&s;t &s;w&eacute;etly vpon two in|&s;truments, which they did till they arriued at the &s;hore: from whence they went vnto the Emperor, who knowing <HI>Carmelle,</HI> had better hope to &s;&eacute;e <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> than euer he had before: &amp; going vnto her to a&s;ke what newes, &s;he made no more reuerence vnto him than &s;he v&s;ed at other times to do, &s;aying vnto him: My lord, <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> my ma&s;ter (that you &s;o much de&s;ire to &s;&eacute;e) is now arri|ued before the town in y^e great &s;erpent with diuers other knights

Truly <HI>Carmelle</HI> (&s;aid the Emperor) I neuer heard me&s;&s;age in al my life that plea&s;ed me &s;o wel, I am content to do as they de&s;ire, although I was determined to m&eacute;et them, and to giue them that entertainement they de&s;erue: But &s;&eacute;eing they will haue it otherwi&s;e, I will &s;ati&s;fie their de&s;ires. That is &s;ufficient (&s;aid <HI>Carmelle</HI>) we will then retourne to them againe, to certefie your graces an&s;were.

With that <HI>Carmelle</HI> with the two Gentlewomen departed to|wards the Hauen: meane time, who&s;oeuer had beheld the Prin|ce&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> might ea&s;ily haue iudged the alteration of her heart, it was &s;o full of ioy, that without Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> y^t cau|&s;ed her to refraine, &s;he would peraduenture haue done done &s;om|thing whereby her honour had been blemi&s;hed, minding to leaue the Empre&s;&s;e her mother, and goe to m&eacute;ete <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> who&s;e ab|&s;ence had procured &s;o great &s;orrow in her mind. But the Qu&eacute;ene as a wi&s;e and di&s;cr&eacute;et lady per&s;uaded her &s;o much, that &s;h&eacute;e &s;tayed at the window, whereby her alteration might not be perceaued. <HI>Carmelle</HI> &s;taied not long, but went into the boate, rowing to the great &s;erpent, where being entered, there were pre&s;ently two boats more put forth, that brought hor&s;es to land, which don, they returned again to fetch the knights, &amp; tho&s;e y^t would went forth, and among them &s;ix gentlewomen, thr&eacute;e of the~ &s;ounding y^e recor|ders, the~ cea&s;ing, the other thr&eacute;e plaied on y^e lute and vials, in that manner being landed &amp; mounted on their hor&s;es, they entred into the Citty, y^e &s;ixe Gentlewomen marching fir&s;t, after them y^e two Turki&s;h captaines y^t were taken at y^e &s;iege of the ca&s;tle <HI>La mon|taigne defendu,</HI> then y^e captain of Te&s;ifant, next followed <HI>Armato,</HI> &amp; with him y^e prince&s;&s;e <HI>Melie,</HI> apparrelled in y^e beares &s;kin as &s;h&eacute;e had ben taken, then followed y^e forty knights two in a ranke, ar|med hor&s;e &amp; man in one &s;ort of armour, in y^e midde&s;t of them road <HI>Vrganda,</HI> talking to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and y^e king of Denmarke. And as they approched y^e pallace, y^e Emperor&punc; y^e Empre&s;&s;e, and the ladies met the~, where y^e emperor comming to <HI>Vrganda,</HI> did her as much
<PB REF="105"> honor as if &s;he had ben y^e greate&s;t qu&eacute;en in the world. Mean time the knights being among the Ladies, gaue occa&s;ion to bee found no le&s;&s;e courteous, then prompt &amp; valiant in armes, &s;pecially <HI>E&s;|plandian,</HI> who comming to the prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> kn&eacute;eled on the ground to ki&s;&s;e her hands, but &s;hee refu&s;ed it, making y^e whole co~|pany bel&eacute;eue, &s;he was offended with him for delaying the time to come vnto the court as he had promi&s;ed. Which the Emperour perceiuing, could not refraine to &s;mile, and &s;aied vnto her: How now daughter? Is this the good entertainement you &s;hewe vnto your knight, and y^e thankes you giue him, for comming expre&s;&s;ely hether to &s;erue you? I pray you call to mind, that he de&s;erueth a better countenance, were it only for his fathers &s;ake, to whome you are &s;o much beholding. My lord (&s;aid &s;hee) y^t is y^e cau&s;e I am &s;o much offended with him, for if he re&s;embled y^e knight with y^e gr&eacute;en &s;word as much in curte&s;ie as in countenance, he had not &s;tayed &s;o long to obay his fathers wil, &amp; to &s;ati&s;fie y^e reque&s;ts y^t you &amp; I haue made vnto him by <HI>Carmelle</HI> and others, as your grace kneweth. Before God (&s;aid y^e emperor) you &s;ay true: yet I could neuer haue ben per&s;uaded you would conceiue di&s;plea&s;ure &s;o long time, con&s;i|dring what he hath done, &amp; y^e rich pre&s;ents he &s;ent to you. My lord (&s;aid &s;he) if he hath done any thing for me, it was without my co~|mandement, I had rather he had done le&s;&s;e in tho&s;e things, &amp; y^t h&eacute;e had ben more obedient to his fathers wil &amp; mine. Madame (&s;aid y^e emperor to <HI>Vrganda</HI>) you &s;&eacute;e in my daughter how great y^e choler of an angry woman is. My lord (&s;aid &s;he) &s;he hath rea&s;on &s;o to do, for y^t <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> obeying his father, ought to confirm him&s;elf both to her wil &amp; yours. And hauing failed therin, all he &s;aith y^t he hath done for her &s;ake, may be accounted nothing, although I am a&s;&s;u|red, y^t the remembrance of my lady your daughter hath made him (being in fight) enter into &s;uch danger, that it was mo&s;t &s;trange howe hee could e&s;cape. Wherefore Madame (&s;aid &s;hee to <HI>Leo|norine</HI>) he de&s;erueth pardo~ for the &s;ame, &amp; &s;o I pray you grant him. While <HI>Vrganda</HI> &s;pake, y^e Princes beheld <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> with &s;o great affection, that in a maner &s;h&eacute;e liued and died in him: and he for his part by hir felt in what &s;ort loue v&s;eth tho&s;e he holds in his power. Wherby &s;he co~tinued a long time without an&s;wering <HI>Vrganda,</HI>
<PB REF="106"> not for any euill will to her in v&s;ing of tho&s;e &s;p&eacute;eches, but rather f&eacute;eling &s;uch alteration in her mind, that &s;he trembled like a leaf. But in the end &s;he remembred her &s;elfe, and &s;aied vnto her: Ma|dame, &s;&eacute;eing it is your plea&s;ure that I remit his offence, I am content to doe it, vpon condition, that if h&eacute;e forget him&s;elfe as h&eacute;e hath done heretofore, you &s;hall beare the puni&s;hment for him. With that &s;he tooke him by the hand, and made him ri&s;e vp, chan|ging &s;p&eacute;ech, becau&s;e the Empre&s;&s;e (that in the meane time talked with the king of Denmarke) came thether, whereby <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> was con&s;trained to leaue the Prince&s;&s;e, and &s;alute her. The em|peror al that while had giuen no entertainement to king <HI>Arma|to,</HI> as knowing him not, but when they &s;hewed him which was he, he imbraced him and &s;aid: My lord and brother, I be&s;&eacute;ech you pardon my ignorance, in not entertaining you before this time, as not knowing you, but I will amend the fault when you think good. My lord (&s;aied <HI>Armato</HI>) I am now (as it plea&s;eth fortune) in place where you may command me, yet I pray you call to mind who I was, and what I may bee, and doe for me as you would I &s;hould do for you if your ca&s;e were mine: Con&s;idering with your &s;elfe, that the like hard fortune may fall on you, and that it is no le&s;&s;e vertue to intertain the vanqui&s;hed courteou&s;ly, then to ouer|throw the pui&s;&s;ant enemie. With that the Emperour led him into his pallace, the re&s;t following after him, and when they were in the hall, hee left them with the Empre&s;&s;e to &s;peake vn|to <HI>Frandalo,</HI> and taking him a&s;ide, &s;aied vnto him: <HI>Frandalo,</HI> to let you knowe howe well I do account of the great good &s;eruice you haue done for m&eacute;e, I will that from henceforth you &s;hall bee my ch&eacute;efe &s;tandard bearer, in which place I nowe e&s;ta|bli&s;h you.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII. How Norandel and Queene Minore&s;&s;e fell in loue one of the other, and what conference they had together.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Emperour being among his Knights, making them all the cheare and honour that hee could deui&s;e. It happened that the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> and Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Mino|re&s;&s;e</HI> &s;&eacute;eing the king of Denmark and <HI>No|randel</HI> together, called <HI>Carmelle,</HI> and a&s;|ked her who they were. My Ladies (&s;aied &s;h&eacute;e) you haue &s;&eacute;en him that hath the lea&s;t beard here before, (which is the king of Denmarke) for hee came hether with <HI>Frandalo,</HI> the other is <HI>Norandel</HI> king <HI>Lui&s;arts</HI> &s;onne, e&s;t&eacute;emed for one of the hardie&s;t knights liuing on the earth. I pray you (&s;aid the Prince&s;&s;e) de&s;ire them to come hether, that w&eacute;e may &s;peake with them. With that <HI>Carmelle</HI> called them vnto her, and as they were before the two Prince&s;&s;es, the more they beheld the excellency of their beauties, the more they maruailed at it, and not without cau&s;e, for next vnto <HI>Leonorine</HI> there could hardly be found in all Gr&eacute;ece one that matched qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e,</HI> e&s;pecially in comeline&s;&s;e and good behauiour, but if &s;hee had &s;ome perfection in her, nature had not forgotten her &s;elfe in forming the two knights, e&s;pecially <HI>Norandel,</HI> who till that time had ne|uer felt the &s;tings of loue, no more had Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e.</HI> Ne|uerthele&s;&s;e, that little th&eacute;efe &s;urpri&s;ed them &s;o couertly, that hee bound them both, making them captiues one to the other, in &s;uch manner, that after many Que&s;tions and An&s;weres propounded they drew them&s;elues apart, leauing the king of Denmarke tal|king with the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> the Qu&eacute;ene a&s;king <HI>Norandel</HI> what hee thought of the Prince&s;&s;e. Madame (&s;aid h&eacute;e) although I haue heard her e&s;t&eacute;emed for one of the goodlie&s;t ladies in y^e world, yet did I neuer thinke her beautie had b&eacute;ene &s;uch as now I &s;&eacute;e it is, although you are little behinde her in that re&s;pect, whereby I
<PB REF="107"> might e&s;t&eacute;eme my &s;elfe mo&s;t happy if I had ben a&s;l&eacute;epe that day I enterpri&s;ed to take my iourney hether. Wherfore (&s;aid the qu&eacute;en) haue you had &s;o ill intertainment in this court? No madame (&s;aid he) but there is one hath &s;tollen that from me which I haue mo&s;t carefully kept during my life. The Qu&eacute;ene not knowing what he meant, was thereat aba&s;hed, a&s;king him what it was, &amp; whe|ther he knew the th&eacute;efe. I madame (&s;aied he) and it re&s;teth in you to do me iu&s;tice, if it b&eacute;e your plea&s;ure: for you &amp; none other haue that whereof I &s;peake. In good faith (&s;aied the Qu&eacute;ene) you &s;hall pardon mee, for I haue nothing of yours that I cam remember. Madame (&s;aied <HI>Norandel</HI>) &s;ince the time I fir&s;t did knowe what belonged to a man, I kept my liberty, not alienating it to any one: But comming hether (I had no &s;ooner &s;et mine eie on you) but I found my &s;elfe of a fr&eacute;eman a bond&s;laue and captiue to your ladi&s;hips good fauor: which I be&s;&eacute;ech you afore me, in recompence of y^e liberty you now haue taken from me. Truly &s;ir knight (&s;aied &s;he) you haue at this pre&s;e~t run too far a&s;tray, for if you beheld me as you &s;hould, you had not found me &s;uch a one as you &s;ay, &amp; wold haue ben twice adui&s;ed to v&s;e &s;uch &s;p&eacute;eches as you do. Neuerthe|le&s;&s;e, I will not take them at your hands (being a &s;tranger) in &s;o euill part as mine honour doth require, and I think likewi&s;e you &s;peake farre otherwi&s;e then you meane: which &s;he &s;aid to vnder|mine him, thereby to &s;&eacute;e if <HI>Norandels</HI> words were &s;poken from the heart, who hearing that ouerthwart an&s;were, was much a|&s;toni&s;hed, but being moued with loue, an&s;werd her and &s;aid: Ma|dame, pardon my boldne&s;&s;e I be&s;&eacute;ech you, but I &s;weare vnto you, by the faith of a knight, that I haue di&s;couered the &s;ecret of my heart: and if you will not bel&eacute;eue me at this time, I hope in time to come to doe &s;o much, that you &s;hall well perceiue what great de&s;ire I haue to bee your Knight, if it will plea&s;e you to graunt mee &s;o much fauour to accept mee for the &s;ame. When Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> perceaued him &s;o earne&s;t, as that in vttering tho&s;e words hee &s;hewed great affection, &s;hee e&s;t&eacute;emed in her minde to haue &s;ufficient argument that might per&s;uade her to bel&eacute;eue his wordes, wherewith &s;hee an&s;wered him and &s;aied: My lorde <HI>Norandel,</HI> If you doe as you promi&s;e, I well bel&eacute;eue that you
<PB REF="107"> &s;ay: and for the accepting you to bee my Knight, mee thinketh I &s;hould doe wrong to refu&s;e &s;o &s;mall a fauor to &s;o courteous a gen|tleman as you are: wherfore I both grant it and de&s;ire it of you. With y^t &s;he took a litle ring (&s;he commonly wore) off from hir fin|ger, giuing it vnto him for a witne&s;&s;e of their new confirmed ali|ance: And had it not ben y^t y^e Emperor was ready to go to &s;upper, they had no &s;ooner left talking, but y^e Empre&s;&s;e went in, whereby qu&eacute;en <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> was con&s;trained to follow after, taking <HI>Melie</HI> &amp; <HI>Carmelle</HI> w^t hir, to whom &s;he did al honor &amp; good intertainme~t &s;he could deui&s;e: &s;upper being don, &amp; y^e tables vncouered, y^e princes <HI>Le|onorine</HI> y^t had &s;&eacute;en <HI>Norandel</HI> &amp; qu&eacute;en <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> talking w^t &s;o great affection, doubted &s;ome feathers in y^e wind, wherefore taking her a&s;ide, &s;aid vnto hir: Cou&s;in, I bel&eacute;eue y^e knight y^t intertained you &s;o long, told you &s;ome news out of great Brittaine, or &s;omthing els y^t plea&s;ed you ful wel, I pray you fair lady tel me what it was, for you were very earne&s;t to harken thervnto. How now madame? (&s;aid &s;he) &s;ince when I pray you, did you learn to mock? cal you y^e mocking (&s;aid &s;he) which is don in earne&s;t? I pray God y^e mockery I mean to you may fal out as I de&s;ire it wold: the~ &s;hal I at y^e lea&s;t haue as good adua~tage at you, as you haue had at me, which wold plea&s;e me wel, not &s;o much to haue a co~panio~ in mine own e&s;tate, as to y&eacute;eld you in excha~ge y^e like plea&s;ure I haue receiued at your hands, whe~ you fir&s;t were made acquainted with y^e loue betw&eacute;en <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &amp; me. Wherfore fear not to vtter your mind vnto me, otherwi&s;e I wil from henceforth haue you in a iealou&s;ie, for that you haue already done, or yet would doe. Madame (&s;aid y^e qu&eacute;ene) rather the~ you &s;hould do &s;o, I wil declare to you y^e &s;ecrete&s;t thing I know. The knight (&s;aid &s;he) wherof you &s;peak, (I know not by what means) hath &s;o captiued my mind, y^t I f&eacute;el y^e thing in my &s;elf which I neuer thought could haue happened to me. And as they y^t are mole&s;ted with a co~tinual ague, do find y^e ta&s;t of water better the~ y^e hope of life to the~: &s;o I likewi&s;e, y^e was accu&s;tomed not only to co~temn the force of loue, but blame al &s;uch as y&eacute;eld to his might, (e&s;t&eacute;eming their e&s;tate rather voluntary then forcible) finde my &s;elfe &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed, y^t if God help me not, I am in the greate&s;t danger y^t euer poore woman was. What (&s;aid the prince&s;&s;e) think you my lord <HI>Norandel</HI> is of &s;o hard a heart, and little courte&s;ie, as
<PB REF="108"> that hee would di&s;daine the loue of &s;o faire and comely a Lady as you are? Doe you perceiue by him, that his mind is placed el&s;e|where? No madame (&s;aied &s;he) but to the contrary, hee prote&s;ted to be wholly mine, without any further aduantage, then that I haue accepted him for my knight. Truly (&s;aied <HI>Leonorine</HI>) I am glad thereof, and if you had done otherwi&s;e, he might &s;urely haue complained, and you much more to haue refu&s;ed &s;o great a good, when it is offered without di&s;&s;imulation: el&s;e if it b&eacute;e otherwi&s;e, it is no good, but rather a cur&s;e. I am of this opinion (&s;aied &s;hee) that my lord <HI>Norandel</HI> would rather die a thou&s;and deathes then beare that mind: Wherefore determine I pray you to v&s;e him well, a&s;&s;uring you, that I will not faile to &s;uccour you in what I may, and will doe for you as you haue done for m&eacute;e. So long they talked together, that the Emperour and his company ri&s;en from the table, came to &s;&eacute;e the ladies. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, neither the Prin|ce&s;&s;e nor Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> could haue the meanes to entertaine their friends, but onely with a looke, whereby (their hearts pan|ting in their bellies) were &s;ome what ea&s;ed: when night appro|ching, euery man withdrewe him to his re&s;t, but when Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> found her &s;elfe alone, and in her bed, &s;he began to think vpon the &s;p&eacute;eches that <HI>Norandel</HI> v&s;ed vnto her, &s;ometimes deter|mining to a&s;&s;aie, if by any meanes &s;hee could driue the &s;ame out of hir mind, and then pre&s;ently changed thoughts, and &s;aied vnto her &s;elfe: Alas, was there euer greater con&s;tancy in a woman, then that I alwaies had vntill this time? Mu&s;t I nowe of force y&eacute;eld vp the fort, that again&s;t &s;o many hard a&s;&s;aults I held inuin|cible? Alas, I nowe perceiue it is of force, wherefore it is better pre&s;ently to &s;&eacute;eke for remedy, then to con&s;ume thus &s;ecretly as I doe. But what? if I chaunce in this &s;ort to y&eacute;eld vnto mine own de&s;ire, (poore &s;oule that I am) then doe I manife&s;tly perceiue the danger wherein I fall, and the thraldome that I bring my &s;elfe into, from whence while I liue, I &s;hall neuer e&s;cape. Wherefore it were far better for m&eacute;e to bridle mine owne affection, and com|mand that which commandeth me, then do that which hereafter I might repent. With that &s;hee held her peace, and tourning on each &s;ide, like one not well at ea&s;e in body nor in mind, &s;he had no
<PB REF="108"> &s;ooner re&s;olued one thing, but pre&s;entlye di&s;&s;olued it againe, &s;o great was her incon&s;tancy therein. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, hauing well debated with her &s;elfe al the plea&s;ures or di&s;plea&s;ures that might cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e thereby: In the end, with a lowd voice &s;hee vttered the&s;e words: I knowe not what may come to pa&s;&s;e, but Loue promi|&s;eth me great things: Wherefore if the wor&s;t fall out, and that from henceforth I forget my &s;elfe, hee &s;hall beare the blame, and not I, that will doe nothing but vnder his protection: In which opinion, &s;he fel a&s;l&eacute;epe, and the next day <HI>Norandel</HI> and &s;he finding meanes to talke together, they confirmed their loue in &s;uch &s;ort, that they determined to v&s;e the &s;ame more by wi&s;edome, then by pa&s;&s;ion: which tho&s;e that are in like ca&s;e, ought to follow, there|by to attaine vnto the point of their de&s;ired ioyes, which in times pa&s;t before, was commonly called the gracious gifte of Mercy.</P>

About a mile without the citie, the Emperor had built a &s;umptuous pallace, called <HI>Vaelbeniatnof,</HI> as like to that of <HI>Apollidon</HI> in y^e firme I&s;le as well could be deui&s;ed: which place was compa&s;&s;ed with a parke furni&s;hed with all things requi&s;ite for mans delight, whither h&eacute;e meant to lead the ladies, with <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and his companie, as al&s;o king <HI>Armato,</HI> to fea&s;t them in the &s;ame, and for that purpo&s;e within thr&eacute;e daies after their arriuall, they departed from the citie of Con&s;tantinople, and went to Vaelbeniatnof, going into the parke, wherein they found the hunters, and at their fir&s;t entrance a great Hart was &s;ingled out, which in the end after long chace was killed almo&s;t before the ladies: &amp; going further, they e&s;pied a bore &s;o fiercely hunted by dogs, y^t they made him turn, &amp; with his tu&s;kes &s;troke y^e dogs, y^t none dur&s;t &s;et vpon him: but at the la&s;t one of the hunters &s;trake him in the throat, &amp; &s;o he died: &s;o long this &s;port endured, y^e &s;upper time drew on, wherfore the lords &amp; ladies entring into the palace found the tables couered, &amp; &s;itting downe, were &s;erued in mo&s;t &s;umptuous maner: &amp; hauing &s;upped, they began to daunce, which continued till midnight, minding y^e next day to begin their &s;port againe: but fortune minding to beare a part, did &s;o trouble the fea&s;t y^t &s;he gaue them well to vnder&s;tand, how &s;he can worke in all things at her plea&s;ure: for the next day about euening the
<PB REF="110"> knights and ladies being in the Parke, &s;ome talking with tho&s;e to whom they bare affection, and co~tenting their mind with &s;uch deui&s;es as loue to pa&s;&s;e the time in plea&s;ure, put into their heads, others running about and taking plea&s;ure to gather floures, and doe as mo&s;t delighted them. <HI>Melie</HI> (from who~ till then they could not heare one word) went vnto <HI>Vrganda,</HI> &amp; before them all &s;pake vnto her and &s;aid: Madame, I maruell (if it be &s;o that your lear|ning and &s;kill be &s;uch as is reported) why you make no &s;port vnto this company. <HI>Melie</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Vrganda</HI>) where you are pre&s;ent I wil not vndertake to doe it before you, but you &s;hould rather doe it, being well a&s;&s;ured, that the Emperour would bee thankfull for the &s;ame. If it plea&s;ed him (&s;aid &s;he) I am content, vpon conditi|on, that after me you do the like, or better if you can. Truly (&s;aid the Emperour) it is but rea&s;on: and I pray you both to doe it. My lord (&s;aid <HI>Melie</HI>) then command <HI>Vrganda</HI> to lend m&eacute;e a booke that I was wont to haue, whereon the picture of <HI>Medea,</HI> (&amp; her name written ouer it) dooth &s;tand, then &s;hall you beholde &s;ome of mine art, and if <HI>Vrganda</HI> neuer knew it before, &s;he may learne it now of me. In good faith (&s;aid <HI>Vrganda</HI>) that wil I not deny you: with that &s;he called one of her Gentlewomen, willing her to fetch the booke: meane time <HI>Melie</HI> tooke king <HI>Armato</HI> by the hande, and making as though &s;he would &s;peake a word with him, they wal|ked a while together, then they &s;at them downe hard by the place where the empre&s;&s;e and the ladies were talking with ech other, and &s;taying til the thing <HI>Melie</HI> had reque&s;ted, were brought the|ther, which not long after <HI>Vrgandas</HI> Gentlewoman brought vn|to her, &s;he hauing it in her hand opened the booke, and then began to read, making certaine &s;ignes with her eies lifted vp to heauen and calling <HI>Vrganda,</HI> praied her to come thether, &s;aying &s;he &s;hold &s;&eacute;e y^t &s;hee neuer had &s;&eacute;ene before. <HI>Vrganda</HI> not doubting any trea|&s;on by <HI>Melie</HI> prepared, went and &s;at downe by her, and next her king <HI>Armato,</HI> &s;o that &s;he &s;at betw&eacute;ene <HI>Melie</HI> and him, where <HI>Me|lie</HI> began to turne the booke, &s;hewing them certaine prophe&s;ies, and other &s;trange deui&s;es, which continued not long but the aire began to be couered with a round blacke cloud, and there with it &s;&eacute;emed &s;o darke, that they could not &s;&eacute;e each other, at the la&s;t the
<PB REF="110"> cloud opened, and they beheld two horrible dragons comming downe out of the cloud that drewe a waggon, and &s;taied right be|fore <HI>Vrganda,</HI> who by <HI>Armato</HI> and <HI>Melie</HI> was &s;o &s;traitly embra|ced, that whether &s;hee would or not they thur&s;t her in, and they after her.

My good friend (&s;aid &s;h&eacute;e) me thinkes you &s;hould doe this at better ley&s;our, and not in &s;o great ha&s;t as now you doe: yet am I well content to doe as plea&s;eth you: but forget not I pray you (&s;aid &s;h&eacute;e) to returne a|gaine as you haue promi&s;ed.

<P>_THe Dragons bearing <HI>Vrganda, Melie,</HI> and king <HI>Armato</HI> in the aire, flewe &s;o &s;wiftly, that before day they were right ouer the citie of Te&s;ifante, where they &s;et downe their charge: that done, they flewe away, and neuer were &s;&eacute;ene againe: king <HI>Arma|to</HI> was exc&eacute;eding glad when he perceiued him&s;elfe to be in place whereas he might commaund, and went vnto his pallace, where finding the guard, he made him&s;elfe knowen vnto them, that pre&s;ently went to ad|uerti&s;e the prince <HI>Alphorax,</HI> who much aba&s;hed at tho&s;e newes, &s;tart out of his bed, and ca&s;ting a furred gowne vpon his &s;houl|ders, ranne to imbrace his father, who &s;&eacute;emed to be &s;o changed, not onely becau&s;e his beard was longer than he v&s;ed, but by rea|&s;on of the great gr&eacute;efe and melancholly he had &s;o long endured, that the prince began to w&eacute;epe, and &s;ay vnto him: My Lord, you are more than heartily welcome, for Gods cau&s;e I be&s;&eacute;ech you tell vs how fortune hath b&eacute;ene &s;o much your friend to deliuer you out of the mi&s;ery wherein you haue continued &s;o long, to my no little griefe. Sonne (&s;aid he) <HI>Melie</HI> can tell you better than my &s;elfe, for &s;he is the only meanes of my good hap, and hath brought with her <HI>Vrganda di&s;cogneue,</HI> (of whome heretofore you haue heard.) And as he left &s;peaking, <HI>Melie</HI> and <HI>Vrganda</HI> entred into the hall, wherewith the rumor of the kings returne was &s;o great within the Citie, that all the people ranne vnto the palace for to &s;&eacute;e him, being as glad of his arriuall, as <HI>Vrganda</HI> &s;orry to &s;&eacute;e her &s;elfe in &s;uch a place, and that which gr&eacute;eued her more, was that <HI>Melie</HI> in pre&s;ence of them all, &s;pake vnto her and &s;aid: <HI>Vrganda,</HI> two things mooue me to &s;aue thy life: the one, for that in my cap|tiuitie
<PB REF="111"> thou ha&s;t not once &s;uffered an euill word to be v&s;ed to me, neither permitted that any man &s;hould doe mee harme: the other becau&s;e I certainly know that king <HI>Armato</HI> hath by thy means receiued all the good intertainement he had, during his hard im|pri&s;onment. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, the mi&s;chiefe thou ha&s;t procured vn|to this country (being the only cau&s;e the Chri&s;tians entered into the &s;ame) is &s;ufficient to make th&eacute;e indure perpetuall impri&s;on|ment: wherein by mine art I will &s;o &s;traightly inclo&s;e th&eacute;e, that thy Art &s;hal nought auaile th&eacute;e euer &s;o get forth. But although that &s;entence might well aba&s;h <HI>Vrganda,</HI> yet &s;hee &s;hewed &s;uch con&s;tancy, y^t &s;he neuer changed colour, determining w^t her &s;elfe to indure what&s;oeuer &s;hould fal out, wherfore &s;he &s;aid vnto <HI>Melie:</HI> Madame, you may do with me as plea&s;eth you, but in rea&s;on you ought not to v&s;e me otherwi&s;e then you your &s;elfe were v&s;ed whe~ I had the like authority ouer you, as you haue now of me, other|wi&s;e you &s;hal do wrong both to your &s;elfe &amp; me: To me, y^t am olde &amp; ancient, putting me in pri&s;on, wherewith you threaten me, (not hauing offended you,) &amp; to your &s;elfe, in preferring cruelty before the curte&s;ie y^t hath ben found in you: whereto <HI>Melie</HI> an&s;wered hir not a word, but commanded her to be &s;hut into a great tower &s;ta~|ding in the mid&s;t of y^e citty, ouer y^e which &s;he wrought &s;uch coniu|rations, y^e <HI>Vrganda</HI> knew without Gods help, it would be impo&s;|&s;ible for her euer to come forth: yet &s;he liued in hope, con&s;idring y^e mutability of fortune, &amp; y^e king <HI>Armato</HI> him&s;elfe had ben ca&s;ually deliuered, who continued certaine daies in his great Citty of Te&s;ifant, without making any &s;hew to bee reuenged. But in the end he &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adours to all the Princes in the Ea&s;t y^t were his allies and confederates, de&s;iring them to enter into arms, not onely to driue the Chri&s;tians out of Galatia, Alfarin, and other places that they had v&s;urped in his countrey, but to de&s;troy Con|&s;tantinople with all the Chri&s;tian monarch, and therefore wrote a letter vnto them, the contents whereof doe follow.</P>
<P><HI>Armato,</HI> by the prouidence of our immortall gods, called to the gouernment of the pui&s;&s;ant country of Turky, the frontier &amp; Bulwark of al y^e Pagan land, to all caitifes, kings, &s;oldiors, ad|mirals &amp; gouernors of y^e countries &s;cituated in y^e ea&s;t parts, &s;e~deth
<PB REF="112"> gr&eacute;eting, being returned out of pri&s;on, from whence we are now deliuered, I thought good to giue you to vnder&s;tand, that not long &s;ince there is a knight come out of the South into the mar|ches, de&s;cended (as men &s;ay) of the race of <HI>Brutus</HI> the Troiane, to whome for our iniu&s;tice (as it is verie likely) our gods haue giuen power to conquer the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> &s;laying <HI>Matroco</HI> and <HI>Frerion,</HI> two of the be&s;t Knightes in all the Ea&s;t parts: and which is wor&s;e (the number of the Chri&s;tians increa|&s;ing more and more) they haue fought all meanes to de&s;troy our holy lawe: which to preuent, we entred into armes, and hauing rai&s;ed a mightie armie, thought to driue them out of our quar|ters: but hauing long time continued &s;iege before the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> and brought it to &s;uch extremitie, that they had no victuals to &s;u&s;taine them&s;elues, he of whome we were mo&s;t in doubt, the fir&s;t beginner of tho&s;e warres, found meanes by the aid of a villaine named <HI>Frandalo</HI> (that &s;ometime belonged vnto vs) to enter therein, and by &s;ubtiltie to take vs pri&s;oners, in &s;uch &s;ort, that our army being ouerthrowne, we remained pri&s;oners in their handes, where they haue holden vs in &s;traight k&eacute;eping almo&s;t for the &s;pace of a whole y&eacute;ere togither: meane time our fortune continuing wor&s;e and wor&s;e, they haue by trea|&s;on &s;eazed vpon the townes of Alfarin and Galatia, two of the be&s;t portes in all our Realme: which they had neuer taken in hand without the aide of the traiterous and di&s;loyall Emperour of Con&s;tantinople: who for to aid and &s;uccour them, hath fal&s;ly broken the truce concluded betw&eacute;en vs, and rai&s;ed &s;o many men, that without your aides, we are in danger to fall into their ha~ds, a thing that would concerne you much, &s;&eacute;eing we (as you know) are the frontire and rampart to you all. Wherefore in the name of all our gods, wee pray and de&s;ire you, that not onely for the &s;afegard of our law, but for the profit and vtilitie of all the Ea&s;t countries, you will a&s;&s;emble your forces in &s;o great number, that thereby we may driue the&s;e Chri&s;tians out of our countrey, and conquer the Empire of Con&s;tantinople, euen to Fraunce, and the countries of great Brittaine, which will be both ea&s;ie and profitable vnto vs. The&s;e letters written and the me&s;&s;engers
<PB REF="112"> di&s;patched, they made &s;uch ha&s;t, y^t before y^e end of Iuly following, there were &s;o many men a&s;&s;embled at the port of Tenedos, that the Chri&s;tians had newes thereof, as hereafter you &s;hall heare. One day among the re&s;t as <HI>Belleris, Talanque,</HI> and <HI>Manely</HI> being i&s;&s;ued out of the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> hoping to take &s;ome Turke in the way to Te&s;ifant that might tel them news, not on|ly of king <HI>Armato,</HI> but of <HI>Melie</HI> &amp; <HI>Vrganda,</HI> as day began to ap|peare came vnto the aduenturous fountain, where they beheld y^e pillers of bra&s;&s;e, y^e pauillion, &amp; y^e field bed y^e <HI>Heliaxe</HI> had left there, with a great &s;erpent lying therein, which pre&s;ently began to run away, and the knights after, thinking to kill her, but their hor&s;es dur&s;t not go n&eacute;ere her, yet &s;he began to complain and w&eacute;ep as bit|terly as a woma~ trauelling w^t child. Wherewith there appeared four men wel mounted &amp; armed at al points, y^t cried out and &s;aied: Sir knights, depart frem hence &amp; trouble not our gentlewoman in this &s;ort, or it &s;hall co&s;t you your liues. And &s;car&s;e had they en|ded their &s;p&eacute;ech, but they ran ech at other, y^e &s;trange knights brea|king their &s;peares in &s;uch maner vpon the Chri&s;tians, y^e <HI>Manely</HI> and his companions thought they had run again&s;t the~ with long &s;trawes. Yet could not one of the~ couch his launce, but ran their cour&s;e without once touching the~. Mean time, the &s;erpent entred into a hole, and could no more be &s;&eacute;ene, &amp; as they turned their hor|&s;es to run another cour&s;e, the four knights would not abide, but flying away, cried vnto them and &s;aid: Sir knights, our Gentle|woman is &s;afe, for y^e re&s;t conte~t your &s;elues if you think good. Get you hence to al the deuils (&s;aid <HI>Talanque</HI>) and ill fortune might he haue y^t followeth after you. With y^t they thr&eacute;e returned vnto the fountain, not without great laughing at their aduenture. And as they were before the pauillion, they perceiued a knight that wa|tred his hor&s;e, to who~ <HI>Belleris</HI> riding, a&s;ked him his name: What haue you to do therwith? (&s;aid he.) So much (&s;aid <HI>Belleris</HI>) that ei|ther you &s;hal tell me pre&s;ently w^t good wil, or els &s;hal &s;ight w^t me. You &s;hal faile in the one, but not in the other: for although you b&eacute;e thr&eacute;e, yet am I well content to prooue what the knights of great Brittaine can doe. Whe~ <HI>Talanque</HI> heard him &s;peake &s;o boldly, he could not refrain to &s;ay: By God &s;ir knight, that &s;hall you prooue
<PB REF="113"> without delay, &amp; &s;etting &s;purs to his hor&s;e, ran fiercely again&s;t the other that refu&s;ed him not, but &s;trake him &s;o &s;ure, y^t he ouerthrew him to y^e ground. Which <HI>Manely</HI> wondring at, &s;et forward to re|ue~ge his friend: but if y^e fir&s;t &s;ped ill, he &s;ped no better, no more did <HI>Belleris:</HI> all thr&eacute;e ri&s;ing vp againe, a&s;hamed at their fals, which minding to amend by dent of &s;words, the other knight fled along the wood, crying &s;o lowd, that they might heare him &s;aie: Sir knights, another time &s;it better on your hor&s;es, and trouble not your &s;elues to follow me, if you meane not to lo&s;e your way. In Gods name (&s;aid <HI>Talanque</HI>) what may this mean, &s;hall w&eacute;e haue no better fortune all this day, I thinke wee are inchaunted. Let vs mount vpon our hor&s;es and follow after him, that wee may knowe whether God or all the diuels in hell haue determined to cro&s;&s;e vs in this iourny. Wherewith they mounted, determining to follow after y^e other, but they heard a lamentable voice, wher|fore they &s;taied to &s;&eacute;e what it might bee. With that they e&s;pied a woman with her head vndre&s;t, crying out for helpe: And after her ran a lion ready to deuour her: whereat they being mooued with compa&s;&s;ion, thought to &s;tep betw&eacute;en the~, but the lion began &s;o horribly to rore, y^t the hor&s;es &s;tricken with fear, bare their ma|&s;ters aboue two long bows &s;hot from thence: meane time, y^e wo|man and the lion vani&s;hed away, whereat <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Manely</HI> more aba&s;hed then before, a&s;ked <HI>Belleris</HI> if euer hee heard of &s;uch adue~tures. In good faith (&s;aid he) tho&s;e y^e are de&s;irous to &s;&eacute;e &s;tra~ge things, mu&s;t repaire vnto this fountaine: For there are manie (&amp; &s;uch as yet you haue not &s;&eacute;ene) y^e wonder it is to hear, &amp; wil you know how it commeth to pa&s;&s;e? <HI>Melie</HI> had deui&s;ed the~ long time &s;ince, wherfore it is not to be maruelled. No more I doe not (&s;aid <HI>Manely:</HI>) neuertheles, were it not for y^e enterpri&s;e we now haue take~ in hand, by the faith of a knight (&s;aid he) I would not depart from hence before I had &s;&eacute;ene them all. That &s;hall b&eacute;e at another time (&s;aid <HI>Belleris:</HI>) let vs now k&eacute;epe on our way, y^t wee be not di&s;|couered. With y^t they held on the left hand, alwaies riding tow|ard the citty of Te&s;ifant: &amp; hauing ridden about fiue miles &s;pace, they met ten men on hor&s;eback all vnarmed, leading two Gen|tlewomen, one of them being &s;omewhat faire and well apparel|led.
<PB REF="113"> But the ten men were in &s;o great fear, y^e leauing the Gentle|women, they ran and &s;aued the~&s;elues not being pur&s;ued, for the thr&eacute;e knights &s;taied w^t the gentlewomen, of whom they hoped to hear &s;uch news as they de&s;ired. And in effect, after they had &s;om|what a&s;&s;ured them, they a&s;ked them what news of king <HI>Armato,</HI> and whether he were &s;til pri&s;oner. My lords (&s;aid the elde&s;t Gen|tlewoman) it is not long &s;ince hee e&s;caped out of the Chri&s;tians hands, and is returned vnto Te&s;ifant with <HI>Melie,</HI> that hath &s;hut <HI>Vrganda</HI> in a tower, from whence &s;he &s;hal neuer depart without her leaue. That is good newes for vs then (&s;aid <HI>Belleris:</HI>) and what hath king <HI>Armato</HI> done &s;ince his returne? Doth he not (&s;aied he) meane to bee reuenged on them that kept him pri&s;oner &s;o long? I truly (&s;aid &s;he) for all the kings, Souldans, Cailiffes, and admi|rals of the Pagan law, haue promi&s;ed him to arriue at Con&s;tan|tinople, and to de&s;troy all Chri&s;tendome. And as it is &s;aied, the mo&s;t part of them are already arriued in the i&s;le of Tenedos. In good faith &s;aid <HI>Belleris</HI> to his companions,) con&s;idering the &s;p&eacute;e|ches of the&s;e Gentlewomen, I am of this opinion, that we med|dle no longer with them, but returne vnto our hold. Wherevn|to they both agr&eacute;ed, and letting the Gentlewomen depart, made &s;o great ha&s;t, that about two houres after &s;unne&s;etting they ar|riued at the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> where they &s;hewed their companions what aduentures they found in the aduenturous fountaine. And at our departure from thence (&s;aid they) we found tenne men on hor&s;ebacke leading two Gentlewomen, by whom wee haue for certaine vnder&s;tood, that <HI>Vrganda</HI> is &s;traightly &s;hut vp in one of the towers of Te&s;ifant, and &s;o inchaunted therein by <HI>Melies</HI> coniurations, that &s;he is like neuer to come forth, as al|&s;o that the Pagan kings a&s;&s;emble them&s;elues together in the i&s;le of Tenedos, to ouerrun the Emperour of Con&s;tantinople, and all the Chri&s;tians countrey.</P>

And as they were in debating of the matter, <HI>Cre&s;celin</HI> nephewe to the Admirall of Gr&eacute;ece, (that not long before had &s;tollen tenne Gallies from the Emperour to roue vpon the &s;ea) came to aduerti&s;e the Knights, that as he &s;ailed into Phrigia, he had di&s;couered in the i&s;le of Te|nedos, &s;o many Gallies, Foi&s;tes, and other ve&s;&s;els, of the ene|mies, that the &s;ea &s;&eacute;emed couered therewith, who without doubt a&s;&s;embled to ouerrun the Emperour &amp; de&s;troy all Chri&s;tendome: wherefore (&s;aid he) I thought to let you vnder&s;tand the &s;ame, not onely becau&s;e you might prouide for them, but al&s;o to de&s;ire your fauours to entreate the Emperour in my behalfe: a&s;&s;uring you, that if hee pardon the offence I haue committed again&s;t his maie&s;ty, I will fro~ henceforth do him &s;o good &s;eruice, that he &s;hall like it well. My lord <HI>Cre&s;celine</HI> (&s;aied <HI>E&s;plandian</HI>) I haue alwaies heard y^e emperor reported to be one of the be&s;t princes liuing in y^e world, &amp; mo&s;t ea&s;ie to b&eacute;e appea&s;ed, whe~ w^t rea&s;on men reconcile them&s;elues vnto him: wherefore I am a&s;&s;ured, y^t if he know you mean faithfully to &s;erue him as you prote&s;t, y^t he wil not only for|get your fault, but do you much more good the~ to others of his me~:
<PB REF="114"> and the better to incite him thereunto, I am of this opinion, that with your &s;hips you pre&s;ently returne to the goulfe <HI>Propontide,</HI> &amp; there (if it be po&s;&s;ible) &s;hall find the means to take &s;ome Turki&s;h gally, thereby to know the truth of their intent: and if you will, <HI>Belleris</HI> &s;hall go with you, and according to your reports, we will determine what were be&s;t for vs to do, wherevnto the pirat wil|lingly condi&s;cended: &s;o that the &s;ame day he put to &s;ea, and with <HI>Belleris</HI> they coa&s;ted the countrey of Thrace vnto Solombre, where &s;taying &s;ecretly at the entrie of the goulfe, they continu|ed certaine daies to bring their enterpri&s;e to pa&s;&s;e: meane time <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> not being idle, &amp; thinking vpon the newes that <HI>Cre&s;|celin</HI> brought, was of adui&s;e that <HI>Frandalo</HI> &amp; all the other knights of great Brittain &s;hould returne to Con&s;tantinople to aid y^e Em|peror (which he de&s;ired them to do:) &amp; I (&s;aid he) with the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin,</HI> and <HI>Enil,</HI> with the garri&s;on of this place, will &s;tay the returne of tho&s;e that are gone to Tenedos, and ha|uing &s;poken with them, either we will remaine here &s;till, or pre|&s;ently follow you. E&s;t&eacute;eme I pray you, if this opinion of <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> were liked of by <HI>Norandel,</HI> for that from the day he left qu&eacute;en <HI>Minore&s;&s;e,</HI> he had not &s;hewen a plea&s;ant countenance, but was &s;o melancholly that euery man wondred thereat: and although the re&s;t were not infected with the like di&s;ea&s;e, yet was there none that &s;tarted backe, but all agr&eacute;ed to <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> mind: wher|vpon without long delay, they imbarked them&s;elues with &s;o good a wind, that the &s;euenth day after they arriued at Con&s;tantino|ple, whereof the Emperour being aduerti&s;ed was exc&eacute;eding glad, going to m&eacute;et them at the hauen: and hauing embraced them one by one, not &s;&eacute;eing <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> in their company, hee a&s;ked where they left him: with that the knights told him what intelligence they had receiued by <HI>Cre&s;celins</HI> means from out of A&s;ia, the great danger prepared again&s;t him by the kings of the Ea&s;t, how h&eacute;e and <HI>Belleris</HI> were returned to &s;&eacute;e the countenance of the enemie, and to know more certaine newes: and la&s;tly, what the occa&s;ion was why <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;tayed behind in the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne de|fendu,</HI> with the king of Denmarke, <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil.</HI> The Em|perour hearing the&s;e newes, was much aba&s;hed, yet like a &s;tout
<PB REF="115"> and valiant prince di&s;&s;embled what he thought, and not long af|ter (minding to preuent all inconueniences) in all ha&s;t cau&s;ed Con&s;tantinople and his other townes, places, and hauens of the &s;ea, to be prouided of victuals and munition as h&eacute;e thought m&eacute;e|te&s;t for them: meane time &s;ending forth his captaines through|out all his Empire, to a&s;&s;emble men in all places, that might be readie when occa&s;ion &s;erued. Thus did the Emperour take care to prouide for his affaires: and <HI>Norandel</HI> meane time to gouerne <HI>Minore&s;&s;e,</HI> who minding to trie him like gold within the fornace, one day among the re&s;t &s;hewed him a harder countenance than v&s;ually &s;he did, faining &s;he had receiued newes that he loued a la|die in great Brittain: wherein <HI>Norandel</HI> by all meanes &s;ought to excu&s;e him&s;elfe: but the more he &s;&eacute;emed con&s;tant, &s;o much more did the Qu&eacute;ene make him bel&eacute;eue &s;h&eacute;e thought the wor&s;e of him: wherewith he was in &s;uch perplexitie, that hee could not choo&s;e but &s;ay: In faith madame, as farre as I perceiue, you meane to end my daies, for the wrong you do me is &s;o great, that it can not well be iudged but by &s;uch as know your crueltie: and yet the af|fection I beare you is &s;o great, that neither I nor any other can well expre&s;&s;e the &s;ame, if pre&s;ently they doe not &s;hew the beauty and perfection wherewith nature hath adorned you. Wherefore e&s;tranging me from your wonted fauour, I perceiue my life be|gin to &s;horten, wherewith I am not grieued, were it not, that dying, I &s;hould loo&s;e the meanes to doe you &s;eruice, but not the benefite of loyaltie: for whether I liue or die, the &s;ame &s;hall &s;till accompanie my &s;oule vnto the place of re&s;t. Which wordes when <HI>Norandel</HI> had vttered, the tears trickled down his ch&eacute;ekes. Whereat Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> tooke &s;uch pitie, that forgetting her di&s;&s;imulation, with a &s;miling countenance &s;h&eacute;e an&s;wered him and &s;aid: My good friend, I now bel&eacute;eue you well, and therefore I pray you pardon my indi&s;cretion: for &s;o it is, that this that I haue done, hath b&eacute;ene onely to auoid the meanes that &s;hould pro|cure you to attempt the &s;ame. Now I well perceiue your con|&s;tancie (according to my coun&s;ell at your la&s;t departure hence) remember I be&s;&eacute;ech you how nece&s;&s;arie di&s;&s;imulation is to &s;uch as are infected with the like di&s;ea&s;e: I meane, it &s;hould not b&eacute;e
<PB REF="115"> betw&eacute;ene vs two, but before the world that they perceiue it not. Madame (&s;aid <HI>Norandel</HI>) I will not if I may offend your Grace, knowing mine owne con&s;tancie &s;o well, that impo&s;&s;ible it were for me to withdrawe my loue from you, as al&s;o not to &s;erue and honour you, yea though you &s;hould reward m&eacute;e with the grea|te&s;t cruelties that all &s;uch as loue &amp; are not loued, might endure. While they thus deui&s;ed togither, the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine</HI> (that &s;erued them as a watch) entertained <HI>Frandalo</HI> and the re&s;t, and making as if &s;he knewe not the cau&s;e of <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> returne to Con&s;tantinople, &s;h&eacute;e a&s;ked it of them, faining to be di&s;plea&s;ed at the &s;ame, but they excu&s;ed him: in like &s;ort they did vnto the em|perour, as you heard before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. How Cre&s;celin and Belleris returned to the ca&s;tle La montaigne de|fendu, with a &s;hip that they had taken from the Turks, by whome they vnder&s;tood the enemies pretence.</HEAD>
<P>_NOt long after that <HI>Cre&s;celin</HI> and <HI>Belle|ris</HI> departed from the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaign defendu,</HI> &s;ayling as &s;ecretly as they could along the coa&s;t of Phrigia, fortune fauoured them &s;o well, that a Brigan|dine &s;ayling to Tenedos, charged with Turkes, fell into their hands, whereof they left but foure aliue: by whom they certainely vnder&s;tood, that the armie of the Princes of the Ea&s;t was to depart from thence within a mo|neth or &s;ixe w&eacute;ekes after at the furthe&s;t, and &s;aile to Con&s;tanti|nople, which they hoped ea&s;ily to &s;urpri&s;e, hauing by their e&s;|pials had intelligence that the Emperour made no preparation to with&s;tand them. Which hauing heard, they returned with|out longer &s;tay to giue adui&s;e vnto <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> who fearing that the Emperour would not be able to with&s;tand their might, de|termined to v&s;e the ayde of all his feiendes, minding to &s;end
<PB REF="116"> <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> vnto them, with letters to the &s;ame effect: &s;pe|cially to his vncle the Emperour of Rome, to whome h&eacute;e wrote as followeth.</P>
<P>My lord, the danger I &s;&eacute;e prepared again&s;t all Chri&s;tendome, con&s;traineth me to &s;end this me&s;&s;enger vnto you, by whome at large your Grace may vnder&s;tand how great and pui&s;&s;ant an ar|mie all the Kings and Potentates of the Ea&s;t (enemies of our faith) haue lately rai&s;ed, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turkie, therwith to ouer-runne not only the Empire of Greece, but all the land of Chri&s;tendome, and wholly to extingui&s;h our faith and holy lawe. And for that all tho&s;e of whome you hold the place, haue alwaies b&eacute;ene the true defenders of the Chri&s;tian faith, as al&s;o that the ca&s;e toucheth you &s;o n&eacute;ere, I am of this ad|ui&s;e (my lord) that you ought to &s;pare neither mony nor men, but to a&s;&s;emble your forces in all ha&s;t, and prepare your ve&s;&s;els to aid and &s;uccour the good prince, who is the frontier (as you knowe) both vnto you and all the potentates that hold the law of Chri&s;t. I write the like vnto the king my father, and to the mo&s;t part of all the Chri&s;tian Lordes, to whome I &s;end <HI>Gandalin.</HI> And for that <HI>Enil</HI> hath in charge to certifie your grace by word of mouth, what it &s;hall plea&s;e you to demand, I will not trouble you with many lines, be&s;&eacute;eching you to giue credit vnto him, as to my &s;elfe. The like he wrote to the king of Sardaigne: which two me&s;&s;ages <HI>Enil</HI> had in charge: to whome he gaue ample in&s;tructi|ons and remembrances of all the aduerti&s;ements and &s;ecret in|telligences he had receiued from the Turki&s;h coa&s;t: not onely of the number of men both on hor&s;e and foot; but al&s;o of the multi|tude of their ve&s;&s;els and other warlike in&s;truments: commaun|ding <HI>Gandalin</HI> to goe with him till he came vnto Cicilia, where he &s;hould prouide &s;hipping to &s;aile into great Brittaine to <HI>Ama|dis</HI> his father, and from thence to France vnto king <HI>Perion,</HI> then to Sobradi&s;e to <HI>Galaor,</HI> likewi&s;e to king <HI>Bruneau,</HI> to <HI>Quedragant, Dragonis,</HI> and <HI>Go&s;quilant:</HI> to whome he &s;ent like &s;euerall letters: <HI>Gandalin</HI> carrying them likewi&s;e the &s;ame in&s;tructions that <HI>Enil</HI> had vnto the Emperour, commaunding them expre&s;ly to a&s;&s;ure them all, that he would not depart from the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne
<PB REF="116"> defendu,</HI> before their arriuall there, but meant to k&eacute;epe it while breath was in his body. <HI>Gandalin</HI> and <HI>Enil</HI> had &s;o good and pro&s;|perous a weather, that in le&s;&s;e than fift&eacute;ene daies after their de|parture, they pa&s;&s;ed the countrey of Me&s;&s;ine, and landed at Sa|ragource, where <HI>Gandalin</HI> hired a Brigandine to execute his charge. And to the end you may vnder&s;tand what effect their me&s;&s;ages did worke, I will leaue <HI>Gandalin</HI> trauer&s;ing the Medi|teranean Sea, and entring into the Ocean, and &s;peake of <HI>Enil</HI> that arriued at O&s;tre, where as then he found the Emperour ac|companied with king <HI>Flore&s;tan,</HI> deui&s;ing onely of haukes and houndes: but when they e&s;pied <HI>Enil,</HI> pre&s;uming he brought &s;ome ill newes, they a&s;ked him where h&eacute;e left <HI>E&s;plandian: Enil</HI> know|ing how to behaue him&s;elfe, ki&s;&s;ed the letters, and gaue one to the Emperour, the other to the king of Sardaigne: which hauing read, and perceiuing them to be of credit, tooke him apart where hee di&s;couered vnto them all you heard before. With that the Emperour leauing <HI>Enil</HI> with king <HI>Flore&s;tan,</HI> went vnto the gentlemen and knights that then were pre&s;ent, and &s;aid vnto them: My friends, w&eacute;e mu&s;t all to the warres: my nephew <HI>E&s;|plandian</HI> hath aduerti&s;ed me (by this gentleman expre&s;&s;ely &s;ent vnto me) that the king of Turkie and all his allies are in armes, and haue rai&s;ed a mighty armie to a&s;&s;aile my brother y^e Emperor of Con&s;tantinople: but I vow to God (if he giue me life &amp; helpe) that before the moneth of September next en&s;uing, I will be there with &s;uch a force, that I will make him twice repent how hee &s;o ra&s;hly dooth a&s;&s;aile, and learne him to defend him&s;elfe. Wherefore let euery man b&eacute;e ready, for I will goe my &s;elfe in per&s;on: and calling king <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> he a&s;ked him if hee would goe with him: My lord (&s;aid he) to morrow I will &s;end to all my ports &amp; hauens, that all the &s;hips of war that can be found may be in a readines: meane time I will in all parts a&s;&s;emble men to doe as my nephew <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> hath required. My Lord (&s;aid <HI>Enil</HI>) my lord <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> hath written by <HI>Gandalin</HI> to king <HI>Amadis</HI> and other of his friends, whome he hath de&s;ired to ioyne with you, &s;o y^t I hope about one time all your armies wil be ready, &amp; that wiihout long &s;taying for each other, you will a&s;&s;emble all togither. Truly (&s;aid
<PB REF="117"> king <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> it was well deui&s;ed. With that diuers captaines were di&s;patched into &s;undry places to giue order for their men, and to ballace, rigge, and prepare ve&s;&s;els for their voiage into the Ea&s;t. <HI>Gandalin</HI> on the other &s;ide coa&s;ting the I&s;les of Ma|iorque and Minorque, leauing Guinea and Barbarie, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traits of Gibraltar, and had &s;o good a wind, that in fewe daies without &s;taying in Spaine, h&eacute;e arriued in great Brittain with king <HI>Amadis,</HI> who as then continued in London, and pre&s;ented him with the letter that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> &s;ent, &s;hewing him likewi&s;e his charge by word of mouth, the good and euill aduentures that he had had &s;ince he departed from Myrefleur, and among the re&s;t the ouerthrowe of the Turki&s;h armie on the &s;ea, the taking of king <HI>Armato,</HI> the occa&s;ion why the &s;iege ro&s;e vp before the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> the arriuall of <HI>Ga&s;tilles,</HI> the taking of Al|farin, and of the captaine of Te&s;ifant, the &s;urpri&s;ing of Galatia, the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Vrganda:</HI> and la&s;tly all what you haue read at large in the chapters going before. And to the end my lord (&s;aid he) that order may be had to preuent the inconuenience he fore&s;&eacute;eth to be prepared again&s;t all Chri&s;tendome (if it be not &s;uccoured) he hath expre&s;ly willed me to &s;hew you, that he hath had certaine intelli|gence, that all the kings of the Ea&s;t parts haue &s;worne and pro|mi&s;ed, togither to ouerrunne all Chri&s;tendome: which is verie likely, con&s;idering the great preparations and a&s;&s;embly of men they haue alreadie made in the I&s;le of Tenedos: which is &s;uch, that as our &s;pies report, they are at lea&s;t &s;ixe hundred &s;ayle of &s;hippes, and about foure or fiue hundred thou&s;and men. God will helpe vs if it plea&s;eth him, &s;aid king <HI>Amadis,</HI> for my part, I will doe what po&s;&s;ible I may, and will like wi&s;e aduerti&s;e king <HI>Pe|rion</HI> my father and my brother <HI>Galaor.</HI> My lord (&s;aid <HI>Gandalin</HI>) I haue al&s;o charge to trauaile vnto them, and likewi&s;e vnto <HI>Ga&s;|quillan, Don Bruneau, Quedragant,</HI> and others, to whome <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> hath written in like &s;ort as he hath done to you, and hath ex|pre&s;ly giuen me in charge to &s;&eacute;e king <HI>Lui&s;art,</HI> and doe his humble commendations vnto him. It is great rea&s;on (&s;aid the king:) ne|uerthele&s;&s;e I am of this opinion, that before my mother y^e qu&eacute;ene you doe not once declare the occa&s;ion of your comming, but giue
<PB REF="117"> her to vnder&s;tand that all is well, but not vnto the king, if you find him alone: for he is a man (as euery one well knoweth) to take all things with patience as they &s;hall fall out: and becau&s;e my &s;onnes affaires require no delay, I pray you <HI>Gandalin</HI> after you haue refre&s;hed your &s;elfe a day or two, goe on your iourney as you haue in charge. So <HI>Gandalin</HI> that day remained there, du|ring which time Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Oriane</HI> talked long with him: the next day he departed to &s;&eacute;e King <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> and Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Bri&s;enne</HI> at Mire|fleur, who knowing he came of me&s;&s;age from <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> were exc&eacute;eding glad: the Qu&eacute;ene although &s;h&eacute;e were wi&s;e and verie aged, yet could not change her womans nature, but before the king &s;pake any word a&s;ked him for her &s;onne: but <HI>Gandalin</HI> (ac|cu&s;tomed readily to deui&s;e excu&s;es, as h&eacute;e had b&eacute;en in&s;tructed by king <HI>Amadis</HI>) tolde her that he had left him in the firme I&s;le not well at ea&s;e by rea&s;on of his long trauell, but not &s;o ill (&s;aid he) as that he could not haue taken paine to come hither &amp; &s;&eacute;e you, but he feared lea&s;t his &s;icknes would encrea&s;e: wherefore he thought it better for him to k&eacute;ep his chamber a while, than to entertaine a long and enuious ague for a long &s;pace: which the qu&eacute;ene ea&s;ily bel&eacute;eued: and for the hope &s;he had &s;hortly to &s;&eacute;e him, &s;he made no account thereof: neuertheles, the &s;ame euening <HI>Gandalin</HI> tolde king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> all that you heard before, wi&s;ely excu&s;ing him&s;elfe of the &s;p&eacute;ech he v&s;ed before him vnto the Qu&eacute;ene, as king <HI>Amadis</HI> had giuen him charge: wherein king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> commended him, &amp; for the re&s;t he promi&s;ed to thinke theron while he trauailed vnto tho&s;e with whome he had to doe. In this &s;ort <HI>Gandalin</HI> being di&s;|patched, returned to king <HI>Amadis,</HI> who in the mean time (per&s;ua|ded by qu&eacute;en <HI>Oriane</HI>) wrought a marriage for him, as you &s;hall heare. You haue read in the beginning of our hi&s;tory of the &s;erui|ces the gentlewoman of Denmarke did for them, and the things wherein &s;he &amp; <HI>Gandalin</HI> had b&eacute;en exerci&s;ed: wherefore it was rea|&s;on, that hauing b&eacute;en partakers of their youthful toies, &s;he &s;hould al&s;o ta&s;t &s;ome of their pro&s;perous fortunes. Wherefore qu&eacute;ene <HI>Oriane</HI> moued king <HI>Amadis</HI> to make a marriage betw&eacute;en them two, but he thought the match vnfit, becau&s;e the gentlewoman was already aged, &amp; <HI>Gandalin</HI> being yong and lu&s;ty: neuertheles,
<PB REF="118"> as all women that are wi&s;e and of a quicke conceit, can bring their enterpri&s;es to effect, the Qu&eacute;ene found meanes to get the kings con&s;ent: wherby <HI>Gandalin</HI> was no &s;ooner come fro~ Myre|fleur but he took him a&s;ide, &amp; &s;aid vnto him: <HI>Gandalin,</HI> the qu&eacute;ene is de&s;irous to haue you &s;tay with vs, not only for the loue &s;he know|eth I beare vnto you, but al&s;o for the good &s;h&eacute;e wi&s;heth you. And for this cau&s;e &s;he would haue you marry with the gentlewoman of Denmarke, whome &s;he loueth, &amp; will doe much both for her &amp; you, if you con&s;ent thereto: you know her long time &s;ince both to be wi&s;e, good, &amp; vertuous, and for my part I pray you and coun&s;ell you thereunto. <HI>Gandalin</HI> would gladly haue excu&s;ed him&s;elfe, and to &s;ay the truth, he was too yong for &s;o old a match: neuerthele&s;&s;e hauing from his infancie learned to confirme his will to y^e of <HI>A|madis,</HI> he was content to doe as plea&s;ed him: in &s;uch &s;ort, y^t in le&s;&s;e than thr&eacute;e daies after the marriage was celebrated and ended. Meane time king <HI>Amadis</HI> tooke the letters and in&s;tructions that <HI>Gandalin</HI> &s;hould carry to <HI>Ga&s;quillan</HI> and king <HI>Bruneau,</HI> and &s;ent them by a gentleman of his named <HI>Handro,</HI> cou&s;in german to the Counte&s;&s;e of Flaunders, de&s;iring them as much as po&s;&s;ible they might to aide his &s;onne in his &s;o good a cau&s;e: but the next weeke following <HI>Gandalin</HI> more affected to the &s;eruice of <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> tha~ to court his wife, departed from thence to trauaile into Fraunce vnto king <HI>Perion,</HI> and from him to Sobradi&s;e to <HI>Galaor.</HI> Meane time king <HI>Amadis</HI> &s;ent for all the pilots, ma&s;ters, and mariners of his countrey that he could find, commending king <HI>Arban</HI> of Norgales, to take care for all things requi&s;ite for the enterpri&s;e &amp; charges of &s;uch a v&s;age, both for men and ve&s;&s;els. In this maner did the affaires touching the&s;e wars proc&eacute;ed through the greate&s;t part of Europe, while all the kings in the Ea&s;t by little &amp; litle a&s;|&s;embled them&s;elues togither, as you &s;hall heare.</P>

The~ hee &s;ent diuers brigandines vnto Natolia, to di&s;couer the Pagans army, and bring him certaine newes: Meane time, the countrey people reaped all their corn, and brought it to the citty. Within eight daies after the Brigan|dines y^t were &s;ent forth, di&s;couered in the &s;traights of Helle&s;pont the great fl&eacute;et of the Turkes y^t lay at Abides, where they &s;tayed a certaine time to take in victuals and other munitions nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;hips. Whereof y^e emperour being aduerti&s;ed, cau&s;ed his men to mu&s;ter, giuing <HI>Frandalo</HI> charge of the dragon gate, &s;o cal|led, becau&s;e y^t at the foundation of the citty, when it was named Bi&s;ance, there was found a maruellous Dragon vnder the foun|dation of y^e gate, which dragon was bound chained, and nori&s;hed, &s;o long time, y^t it was thought mo&s;t &s;trange. <HI>Norandel</HI> had charge of the gate called quiline, &amp; <HI>Ga&s;tiles</HI> his nephew of that called y^e Well, &s;o named of a great &amp; profound well that &s;toode hard by it. And cau&s;ing the other gates to bee rampired vp, prouided for all things as a wi&s;e &amp; valiant captaine &s;hould do in &s;uch a ca&s;e. With that a Grecian that had ben take~ by the Turks, came into y^e city, and a&s;&s;ured the~ for certaine y^t the Soudan of Liquie was him&s;elfe in per&s;on with king <HI>Armato,</HI> and almo&s;t all the kings of the ea&s;t, hauing two hundred Gallies, as well great as &s;mall, fifty great &s;hips, thirty mahoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and one &amp; twenty cafords, that are &s;hips not much vnlike to gallies: be&s;ides thirtie foi&s;tes and diuers bri|gandines,
<PB REF="119"> barkes, galions and &s;ciffes, wherein they had laid their victuals &amp; other munitions: and for their number of footmen, they might be about &s;ome thr&eacute;e hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, &s;aying likewi&s;e, that <HI>Alphorax</HI> had the ch&eacute;efe charge at &s;ea, and <HI>Armato</HI> on land, and that their determination was neuer to depart from Con&s;tantinople, till they had de&s;troied it, and from thence would go to Rome, &amp; further if they rould. The &s;ixt day after, this great army (pa&s;&s;ing the gulfe of Propontide) came into the &s;traights of Con&s;tantinople, entering in the great &s;ea, where they remained during the &s;iege, robbing all the countrey about, where fir&s;t they &s;taied a w&eacute;eke before they landed any of their men: meane time, certain gallies and &s;mall &s;hips &s;et forward to make an alarum in the hauen, from whence (to their great lo&s;&s;e) they were repul&s;ed, for y^e &s;ixe of the principalle&s;t of them were &s;unk in the &s;ea. Neuer|theles, the next day following they began to land, &amp; in great num|bers thought to win the gate: there were many braue blows both with &s;word and &s;peare giuen on both parts, and many a valiant man ended their daies, &amp; became meat to fi&s;hes. There y^e knights of great Brittain &s;hewed the~&s;elues not to b&eacute;e vnacquainted with &s;uch dangers, &amp; who &s;o had beheld <HI>Norandel, Frandalo, Manely,</HI> &amp; <HI>Talanque</HI> repul&s;e the enemy, y^t thought to aduaunce them&s;elues, might ea&s;tly iudge with what de&s;ire they fought. But what &s;huld I &s;tand longer to de&s;cribe this conflict? To conclude, y^e gate was defended, &amp; the enemies repul&s;ed from the &s;ame, yet their number was &s;o great, y^e notwith&s;tanding the valour of the Emperours men, they landed &amp; lay within two bowes &s;hot of the city, they of the city being forced to retire. The Pagans being on land, deui|ded them&s;elues into four parts, in &s;uch &s;ort, y^t the city was &s;o well be&s;ieged, that not a man could enter or come forth without their leaue. Wherefore king <HI>Armato</HI> pre&s;ently cau&s;ed great number of ladders to bee prepared, the mo&s;t part of them double, hoping before the w&eacute;eke were ended, to a&s;&s;ault, take, &s;poile, and de&s;troye the City. But they within &s;lept neither night nor day, but made artificiall fires, with all other things requi&s;ite for &s;uch a charge. The Pagans &s;taied not long to execute their purpo&s;e, &s;o that vp|on a munday in the morning, they came in great fury to &s;et fire
<PB REF="119"> on the gates, and to &s;cale the Town although for y^e time they lo&s;t their labors, &amp; many of the~ their liues, where in the end they were co~&s;trained to retire to their no litle &s;hame &amp; great confu&s;ion. And in their retraict, <HI>Norandel</HI> with four or fiue hundred men, i&s;&s;ued at a po&s;tern gate, &amp; &s;et vpon them behind, which put the~ in &s;uch fear, y^t they draue them to their tents. Yet not being content with this fir&s;t repul&s;e they determined on friday after either to die, or enter into the town. And the day appointed, ran vnto y^e wals, where the number of y^e a&s;&s;ailants was &s;o great, &amp; the a&s;&s;ault giuen in &s;o ma|ny places both by &s;ea &amp; land, y^t if God had not prouided for them, it is mo&s;t certain y^e town had ben take~: e&s;pecially on <HI>Frandalos</HI> &s;ide, for the mo&s;t part of his men fled away from their guard: wherby it happened, y^t more then a hundred Turks mounted on the wals, but they &s;taied not long, for y^t the emperor (who during the a&s;&s;ault &s;taied in the mid&s;t of the city with the re&s;t of all his power to aid &s;uch places as had mo&s;t n&eacute;ed) aduerti&s;ed therof, marched to <HI>Fran|dalos</HI> quarter, and with &s;uch force repul&s;ed the enemy, that h&eacute;e made the~ glad to get them thence, in &s;uch &s;ort, y^t they receaued no le&s;&s;e lo&s;&s;e at the &s;econd a&s;&s;ault then at the fir&s;t. It is true, y^e ten of y^e knights of great Brittain were &s;laine at y^e conflict, which much gr&eacute;eued their companions, &s;pecially for y^e lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Ledarin,</HI> of <HI>Feiar|que,</HI> of <HI>Trys,</HI> and <HI>Imo&s;il</HI> of Burgundy. This &s;econd a&s;&s;ault hauing had &s;uch i&s;&s;ue as you heard before, <HI>Armato</HI> went to coun&s;ell with all y^e other kings and princes to know what they &s;hold do, where it was concluded to k&eacute;ep their tents, and &s;o inclo&s;e y^e town: for to get it by a&s;&s;ault, they knew ful wel they &s;huld but lo&s;e their labors wherfore they ment no more to try y^e &s;ame: but many times made &s;kirmi&s;hes with y^e citty to their no litle lo&s;&s;e. Thus they pa&s;&s;ed a|boue a month without doing any thing worthy y^e rehear&s;ing, till one day among y^e re&s;t, a gentlewoma~ belonging to the &s;ouldan of Liquie came on me&s;&s;age to the gate y^e <HI>Norandel</HI> had in charge, of who~ &s;he a&s;ked if y^e knight of the great &s;erpent were among them. Wherfore? &s;aid <HI>Norandel.</HI> I bring him (&s;aid &s;he) a letter from the ch&eacute;ef and mo&s;t courteous knight in all A&s;ia. <HI>Norandel</HI> de&s;irous to vnder&s;ta~d the contents of the letter, &s;aid h&eacute;e was the man. Then looke vpon it (&s;aied &s;hee) at your lei&s;ure: And if you thinke it
<PB REF="120"> good returne an an&s;were: with that &s;h&eacute;e turned her hor&s;e, and rid the &s;ame way that &s;hee came. Which done, <HI>Norandel</HI> opened the letter, the contents whereof are the&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Rodrigue</HI> great Soudan of Liquie, friend to the gods, and ene|my to their enemies, defendor of the Pagan law: to th&eacute;e that cal|le&s;t thy &s;elf knight of y^e great &s;erpent, gr&eacute;eting. Know thou that y^e cau&s;e of our long voyage by Sea to enter into the&s;e countries, hath b&eacute;ene in hope to bee reuenged of the outrages that my vn|cle <HI>Armato</HI> king of Turky hath receiued at the hands of th&eacute;e and thy co~panions, not hauing once offe~ded th&eacute;e: and although we are mo&s;t &s;ure of y^e de&s;truction of the wicked emperor y^e fauoureth th&eacute;e in thy &s;o wicked and damnable enterpri&s;es, and that before long time be pa&s;t, both hee and his &s;hall end their liues by our hands, yet &s;hould I be much gr&eacute;eued, that this mi&s;fortune &s;hould happen vnto th&eacute;e, before I haue prooued my body again&s;t thine, becau&s;e of the renowne y^t is &s;pread of th&eacute;e throughout the world. Wher|fore chu&s;e whether thou wilt accept of the combate betw&eacute;ene vs two alone, of tenne to tenne, a hundred to a hundred, or of grea|ter number as thou thinke&s;t good. Swearing vnto th&eacute;e, by all our gods, that tho&s;e thou &s;halt bring with th&eacute;e for that cau&s;e, &s;hall re|ceiue no more di&s;plea&s;ure then my &s;elf, vnle&s;&s;e it be by &s;uch as are ordained to fight with them, according to the agr&eacute;ement we &s;hall make. Wherefore make m&eacute;e an an&s;were worthy &s;uch a Knight, that thereby thy honour be not &s;tained.</P>
<P><HI>Norandel</HI> hauing read this letter, &s;hewed it to his friends, who were all of adui&s;e to graunt the Soudan his reque&s;t. But <HI>Noran|del</HI> would determine nothing before h&eacute;e made the Emperour ac|quainted, vnder who&s;e conduct during the &s;iege, he had &s;ubmitted him&s;elfe: whereupon hee went to &s;peake with him, and hauing &s;hewed him the contents of the letter that h&eacute;e had receiued in <HI>E&s;|plandians</HI> name, and the coun&s;ell of his companions, the Empe|rour a&s;ked him what hee thought therein. My lord (&s;aied hee) if it plea&s;ed you, that I and nine others which I will chu&s;e, &s;hall vn|dertake this combate, you &s;hal doe vs great fauor. My good friend (&s;aid the Emperor) you &s;&eacute;e the e&s;tate wherein I am, and the time wherein I ought to k&eacute;epe, not onely you and others wherein I
<PB REF="120"> put my whole affiance, but the meane&s;t &s;ouldiour in this Cittye. Neuertheles, I will &s;o much agr&eacute;e vnto your will, that if you and your companions thinke it good, I am content you do it. My lord (&s;aid <HI>Norandel</HI>) both I and they mo&s;t humblye craue it of your grace. Wel then (&s;aid the Emperour) If it plea&s;eth God, you &s;hal win honour thereby, as you haue done before in many as perril|lous aduentures as this is. <HI>Norandel</HI> thanked the Emperour, and the &s;ame day cau&s;ed his Knights of great Brittaigne to bee a&s;|&s;embled together, by who&s;e adui&s;e there was an Aun&s;were fra|med to the Soudans letters, the contents whereof doe follow.</P>
<P>The knights that are &s;eruants to Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, being at this time with the Emperor of Con&s;tantinople, for the defence &amp; aug|mentation of the Chri&s;tians name, to th&eacute;e <HI>Rodrigue</HI> Souldan of Liquie, like gr&eacute;eting thou ha&s;t &s;ent vnto the knight of the great &s;erpent: a gentlewoman that &s;aith &s;hee belongeth vnto th&eacute;e, that hath giuen vs a letter directed vnto him, the contents wherof are in two points. In y^e fir&s;t, y^u complaine&s;t of the enterpri&s;es he hath made again&s;t thine vncle king <HI>Armato:</HI> in the other thou &s;hewe&s;t a de&s;ire y^u ha&s;t to proue thy per&s;on again&s;t his, or a greater num|ber again&s;t a greater, as he &s;hal think it good. But for y^t the knight thou write&s;t vnto at this pre&s;ent is not here, nor in place wheras he can return th&eacute;e an&s;wer, we thought it conuenient in his behalf to &s;ati&s;fie thy reque&s;t, &amp; to accept the offers thou ha&s;t made vnto him: a&s;&s;uring th&eacute;e, y^t here is the &s;on of a king, &amp; nine other knights with him y^t wil fight with th&eacute;e and as many more of thine, if thou be content therwith: Adui&s;e thy &s;elf the~ herein, &amp; hauing receiued thy an&s;were, with &s;afe conduict &s;afely to go and come, we wil not faile to be in the place where you &s;hall appoint.</P>
<P>This letter &s;ealed vp, <HI>Norandel</HI> gaue it to one of his &s;quires to bear it to the &s;oudan, who made him an&s;were y^t he de&s;ired only to proue his body again&s;t the knight of y^e great &s;erpent &amp; none other. But (&s;aied he) if tho&s;e y^t &s;ent you hether haue any de&s;ire to fight a|gain&s;t ten of my knights, they &s;hall find the~ ready, being as great gentlemen and of as high a linage as they are. And as touching their &s;afe conduict, I wil &s;o wel prouide for it, y^t they &s;hall haue oc|ca&s;ion to think wel of me: wherfore return thou vnto the~, and let
<PB REF="121"> me know their an&s;were. With that the &s;quire hauing his di&s;|patch, went and came &s;o often betw&eacute;ene them, that in the end the combate of ten to ten was fully agr&eacute;ed vpon, and the li&s;ts appoint hard before the Towne: where they the next morning the tenne knights went, who&s;e names were as followeth. <HI>Norandel, Gar|uate du Val Craintif, Talanque, Manely, Ambor de Galdel, Elian le delibere, Brauor</HI> &s;on of <HI>Balan, Trion</HI> cou&s;in germane to Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Briolanie, Imo&s;il de Burgoigne,</HI> and <HI>Li&s;toran</HI> of the &s;iluer bridge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX. How the ten Chri&s;tian knights entred into the li&s;ts, and of the com|bate betweene them and tenne Pagan knights that belonged to the Souldan of Liquie.</HEAD>
<P>_ALL that night the ten Knights watched in the princi|palle&s;t church of Con&s;tantinople, confe&s;&s;ing the~&s;elues, and praying vnto God as if they &s;hould pre&s;ently die: The next day as the &s;unne began to appeare, the Em|perour accompanied of diuers Noblemen, the Empre&s;&s;e, y^e Prin|ce&s;&s;e <HI>Leonorine,</HI> Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Minore&s;&s;e,</HI> with diuers other Ladies and Gentlewomen, came vnto them, where they heard ma&s;&s;e deuout|ly, that done, they returned vnto the pallace where <HI>Norandel</HI> and his nine companions armed them&s;elues, the ladies &s;eruing them for &s;quires, in &s;uch &s;ort, as <HI>Norandel</HI> receaued &s;uch fauor at qu&eacute;en <HI>Minore&s;&s;es</HI> handes, that &s;hee found meanes to helpe to buckle on euery p&eacute;ece of his armour one after the other. As &s;hee was bu&s;ie about him, he found meanes to &s;ay vnto her: Madame, the honor that you doe me, maketh mee &s;o couragious, that this day I hope to make it knowne to tho&s;e that &s;hall beholde vs fight, how much my &s;trength is now increa&s;ed by your meanes. But if it plea&s;ed you to be&s;tow &s;ome fauour vpon me, that I might bear the &s;ame about my armour, I &s;hould account my &s;elfe for one of the mo&s;t happy knights liuing on the yearth. My good friend (&s;aied &s;he) the mo&s;t precious iewell y^t I can giue vnto you, is my heart y^t &s;hal ac|company yours, to the end, that being vnited together, they may the better pre&s;erue both your life &amp; mine. And taking a bracelet
<PB REF="121"> of gold, that from her infancy &s;he had alwaies kept, &s;hee tied it a|bout his right arme. And this circle (&s;aied &s;he) being round as you behold it, &s;hall without cea&s;ing bee witne&s;&s;e of our loues, &s;eruing for a rampart to this army: which (if it plea&s;eth God) in defending it &s;hal &s;o wel defend his ma&s;ter, y^t he &s;hall return in as good health as I de&s;ire he &s;hould. <HI>Norandel</HI> thanked her mo&s;t heartily: mean time <HI>Leonorine</HI> intertained <HI>Talanque, Manely</HI> &amp; the re&s;t, to whom &s;he &s;aid: My friends, I hope the Lord wil &s;hew you &s;o much grace that the victory &s;hall be yours, for the combat you take in hand is not for to defend the honour of a Gentle woman, but the glorious faith of Chri&s;t. If therfore it be &s;o, y^e &s;trength proc&eacute;edeth from him, be you the~ wel a&s;&s;ured, y^t he wil impart &s;o much to you as you &s;hal want. Madame (&s;aid <HI>Talanque</HI>) at other times we haue ben at the like fea&s;t, from whence we haue returned to the great expence of tho&s;e y^t called vs thither: as (if it be Gods wil) we hope this day to do y^e like. Wherwith taking their leaues of her, they went to find their hor&s;es, and being mounted, the emperor with great number of knights and gentlewomen brought them to the gate: And com|mitting them to God, the ten knights marched brauely to y^e place of combat, where the &s;ouldan with a great number of his friends met the~, a&s;king them whom the emperor had appointed iudge on their &s;ide. Souldan (&s;aid <HI>Norandel</HI>) w&eacute;e de&s;ire no other iudge then your &s;elf, that are accounted a curteous and mo&s;t faithfull prince. By all my gods (&s;aid he) I had rather die a thou&s;and deaths, then you &s;hould indure the lea&s;t iniury in the world: we bel&eacute;eue it wel (&s;aid al the knights. With y^t he cau&s;ed them to enter into the li&s;ts at one end, and the ten pagans at the other: but before they entred into fight, he called <HI>Norandel</HI> &amp; his companions, &amp; &s;aid vnto them: My friends, I pray you let me &s;hew you what the cu&s;tome of my country is in &s;uch affairs: the~ if you think good, you may ob&s;erue it, if not, my knights &s;hal k&eacute;ep your cu&s;tome if it be indiffere~t. Shew vs the~ (&s;aid <HI>Norandel</HI>) what it is, &amp; if y^e &s;ame be rea&s;onable, we wil not refu&s;e it. You &s;hal vnder&s;tand (&s;aid he) y^t all knights iu&s;tle one again&s;t one, to y^e end, y^t all men may know y^e excellency of the vi|ctor: And if any one be ouerthrown, he y^t is on hor&s;eback &s;hall not a&s;&s;aile y^e other before their companions haue run out their cour&s;e:
<PB REF="122"> Then he that is on hor&s;eback &s;hall alight, and &s;hall fight it out by dint of &s;word with him that before was ouerthrown. Becau&s;e it chanceth oftentimes, that the be&s;t knights that are fall into &s;uch inconuenience, only by the fault and means of bad hor&s;es, which cau&s;e them diuers times either to faile in &s;triking of their enemy, or els not to run their right cour&s;e: Which cannot bee excu&s;ed in tho&s;e that are on foot, to whome it is permitted to &s;uccour each o|ther if n&eacute;ed require. Truly (&s;aid <HI>Norandel</HI>) that cu&s;tome is wel or|dained, and I and my companions will ob&s;erue the &s;ame. Wher|with the &s;oudan went out of the li&s;ts, cau&s;ing his Heralds to pro|claim the fight: With that a Pagan &s;tepped forth again&s;t <HI>Noran|del,</HI> that refu&s;ed him not: but couering him&s;elfe with his &s;hield, they met &s;o fiercely, that their &s;pears were broke~ to their wre&s;ts, m&eacute;eting body to body with &s;o great &s;trength, that the Pagan fell ouer his hor&s;e taile, lying flat vpon the ground: but <HI>Norandel</HI> had no hurt, onely that his hor&s;es &s;houlder was thru&s;t out of ioint, &s;o that he lighted of, &s;taying til the re&s;t had runne their cour&s;e, as he had promi&s;ed. Then <HI>Garuate du Val Craintif</HI> ran again&s;t one of the other, and they charged each other in &s;uch &s;ort, that their f&eacute;et failing in their &s;tirrops, they were both ca&s;t out of their &s;addles. Then <HI>Talanque</HI> ran again&s;t the third Pagan, to whome fortune was more fauourable then to any of the re&s;t: for they ran &s;o wel, that neither of them once &s;tarted a&s;ide, or moued in their &s;addles, and yet brake their &s;peares in many p&eacute;eces. The like chanced to <HI>Manely</HI> and <HI>Ambor,</HI> but not to <HI>Brauor</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Balan,</HI> for hee hit him that ran again&s;t him right in the brea&s;t, and threw him from his hor&s;e. And pre&s;ently therewith <HI>Imo&s;il</HI> of Burgundy had &s;o great a &s;troke with a launce, that his eies &s;tarted in his head, and was therewith &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed, that his hor&s;e bare him to the &s;ide of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rriers, where he fell downe flat. <HI>Elian le delibere,</HI> and hee that ran again&s;t him, were con&s;trained to holde by their hor|&s;es maines. <HI>Li&s;toran</HI> of the &s;iluer bridge mi&s;&s;ed his &s;troke, and his enemy likewi&s;e: the like happened to <HI>Trion,</HI> and the la&s;t that ran with him. That done, all they that were on hor&s;ebacke, lighted downe to fight with &s;words, and there began betw&eacute;en them &s;uch a fight as the like had not b&eacute;ene &s;&eacute;ene of &s;o few knights together,
<PB REF="122"> maintaining them&s;elues &s;o brauely one again&s;t the other, that the &s;tronge&s;t of them was &s;o wearie and out of breath, that they were con&s;trained to re&s;t. And as <HI>Norandel</HI> leaned vpo~ his &s;word which he re&s;ted on the ground, the bracelet that <HI>Minore&s;&s;e</HI> gaue him fell downward vpon his arme, which put him in &s;o good re|membraunce of her, that cleane forgetting all the trauaile h&eacute;e he had taken before, he &s;pake &s;o loud that euery man might hear, and &s;aid: By God, &s;ir Knight, this re&s;t doth not be&s;&eacute;eme vs: ma|ny men will from henceforth be in doubt of the great glory that now we meane to win. Wherefore let euery man &s;hewe forth what he can doe, and let no man &s;pare. Wherewith taking the little p&eacute;ece of his &s;hield that re&s;ted in his hand, and lifting vp his arme, he gaue &s;o great a blow vnto his enemie, that he made him r&eacute;ele therewith: and doubling it, &s;trake him &s;o &s;urely on the hel|met, that with the blow the Turke was forced to kn&eacute;ele downe, and let his &s;word fall out of his hand: which <HI>Norandel</HI> &s;ea&s;ed vp|on being readie to &s;trike off his head, if he had not cried him mer|cie: which <HI>Talanque</HI> and <HI>Manely</HI> perceiuing, employed their for|ces in &s;uch manner, that it might ea&s;ily be iudged they would &s;oon obtaine the victorie. As for <HI>Brauor</HI> he had alreadie &s;tricken his knight downe, wherefore he ranne to helpe the re&s;t, and <HI>Noran|del</HI> likewi&s;e. With the which helpe it &s;oone appeared, that they which re&s;ted yet to ouercome would not long re&s;i&s;t: for in &s;hort &s;pace they found them&s;elues in &s;uch extremitie, that vnle&s;&s;e the Souldan of Liquie had de&s;ired the Chri&s;tian knights to &s;tay a while, they had all died: but calling <HI>Norandel</HI> vnto him, he &s;aid: I pray you (&s;aid he) proc&eacute;ed no further in this combat, and con|tent your &s;elues that I account my knights for vanqui&s;hed, as in truth they are, and &s;o hardly handled, that the force you &s;hall from henceforth v&s;e again&s;t them, &s;hall more be holden for a kinde of crueltie than any chiualrie. Neuertheles if my reque&s;t may take no place with you doe as you thinke good. Souldan (&s;aid <HI>Noran|del</HI>) if they acknowledge it at our hands and a&s;ke vs mercie, they &s;hall not faile to haue it: for it was neuer our cu&s;tome to v&s;e force to &s;uch as could not &s;tand again&s;t vs. Content your &s;elues (&s;aide he) that I that am their Lord y&eacute;eld you the victorie, and I pray
<PB REF="123"> you therefore &s;hew mercie vnto them, &s;wearing vnto you by my crowne (if you doe them &s;o much good) that while I liue, I will not be vnmindfull of the &s;ame. With that the ten Chri&s;tian knightes went out of the fielde, and mounting on their hor&s;es, tooke their way vnto the citie, where the Emperour &s;taied for them, for he had &s;&eacute;ene the i&s;&s;ue of the combat, and how they re|turned victors: but he heard not what words had pa&s;t betw&eacute;ene them, till they being lighted off their hor&s;es, told him what was done, for the which hee prai&s;ed God, e&s;t&eacute;eming more of them for their courte&s;ie they had &s;hewen vnto the enemy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. L. How Queene Calafre came to aide the Pagans, and of the maruai|lous and perillous a&s;&s;ault that &s;hee gaue to the citie of Con&s;tan|tinople.</HEAD>
<P>_THe renowne of this warre vndertaken by the Kings, Taborlans, Souldans, Ca|liffes, and Princes dwelling in Tartaria, India, Arabia, and other countries in the Ea&s;t, again&s;t the Emperour and his Em|pire of Con&s;tantinople, was &s;pread &s;o far abroad, that it was knowne to the pui&s;|&s;ant Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Calafre</HI> reigning in Califo|rine, a mo&s;t fertile and plea&s;ant countrey, confining on the head of the riuer Bori&s;tenes, hard by the foot of the Riffee mountains. This countrey whereof I &s;peake, was &s;ometimes peopled with good knights and men of all quarters, but the women vpon ma|lice deui&s;ed a meanes to kill them all, e&s;tabli&s;hing a law among them&s;elues, that from that time forwardes they would acknow|ledge for Ladie and Qu&eacute;ene one of their owne country women, gouerning them&s;elues as the Amazons v&s;ed to doe. Whereby it was not lawfull for any of them to v&s;e the companie of men aboue once or twice a y&eacute;ere, vpon the daies and times by them appointed, when they went out of their owne countrie and v&s;ed
<PB REF="123"> their neighbours helpe, with whom God knoweth if they found not meanes to make them pay the v&s;urie of the time lo&s;t, in &s;uch &s;ort, that mo&s;t of them returned home with child: but the brin|ging vp of their children was far different, for the maiden chil|dren were kept aliue, burning their right paps, but not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> children, for as &s;oone as they were borne they put them to death, hauing agr&eacute;ed not to &s;uffer one aliue, or els &s;o few, that they very ea&s;ily might ouercome them. For this cau&s;e often times they warred again&s;t the Tartarians bordering on their country, put|ting them to great trouble by diuers and continuall inua&s;ions, as well by &s;ea as by land. In their lawes and cu&s;tomes they ob|&s;erued &s;o great rigour, as that if any man (by ca&s;ualtie or other|wi&s;e) fell into their hands, he prooued for food vnto a great num|ber of griffo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s, nouri&s;hed among them when they were young, being &s;o tame and gentle, that neuer any hauke knewe better the Faulkoners lure, then tho&s;e gentle birds knew the voice of her that ordinarily fedde them. To come vnto the point, this qu&eacute;ene of Califorine being a woman of great &s;pirit, valiant, har|die, young, faire, and of good behauiour, hearing of the warres vndertaken again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, was de&s;irous to be there, not for any ill &s;h&eacute;e wi&s;hed them, but onely for to know them, and to &s;&eacute;e their countrey that bare &s;o great renowme. And for that cau&s;e &s;he a&s;&s;embled great numbers of the principall ladies of her countrey, &s;hewing them what honour they might obtaine in that voiage: which may peraduenture be &s;uch (&s;aid &s;h&eacute;e) that by our force and great prowe&s;&s;e w&eacute;e may greatly augment our Empire, b&eacute;eing feared and redoubted of each man, and not con|tinue alwaies buried among the&s;e mountaines, as they in times pa&s;t did, of whome at this pre&s;ent w&eacute;e now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e and enioye the place. The Qu&eacute;ene in this &s;ort could &s;o well per&s;uade them, that they being mooued with a marueilous de&s;ire to goe with her, pre&s;ently prepared their &s;hippes, and &s;et &s;aile for Thracia, with &s;o good and pro&s;perous a winde, that the tenth day after the a&s;&s;aults of Con&s;tantinople, they arriued in the ar|mie of <HI>Armato,</HI> where they were honourably receiued: &amp; after
<PB REF="124"> diuers &s;p&eacute;eches v&s;ed by the Souldan of Liquie, and other princes of the campe vnto the qu&eacute;ene of Califorine, &s;pecially touching their determination concerning that great enterpri&s;e, &s;h&eacute;e being &s;orrie they had done &s;o little again&s;t the towne, de&s;ired them that &s;he might once haue leaue to try her fortune again&s;t it, by means that &s;he would v&s;e. And the better to induce them thereunto, &s;he told them &s;he had fiftie griffons that would not faile (b&eacute;eing let out of their cages) to &s;ea&s;e vpon the Chri&s;tians without hurting of her women, becau&s;e they knewe them and had b&eacute;en nouri&s;hed with them. And while they take their flight (&s;aid &s;he) I will giue &s;uch an a&s;&s;ault again&s;t the towne, that without doubt wee will enforce the &s;ame: for if the Emperors &s;ouldiers appeare but to defend the wals, my Griffons &s;hall be ready to carrie them clean away, as the Merlin doth the larke. But to the end (&s;aid &s;he) your men receiue no hurt, let them abide within their tentes till they be &s;hut into their cages. When king <HI>Armato</HI> and the Souldan of Liquie heard the great zeale and affection &s;he &s;hewed to em|ploy her forces, as al&s;o the inuention that &s;he had, they all agr&eacute;ed that the next day after &s;he &s;hould doe what liked her. Whereupo~ &s;he &s;ent pre&s;ently to her that kept the griffons, that &s;h&eacute;e &s;hould giue them nothing for to eate of all that day, that when they meant to v&s;e them at the a&s;&s;ault, they might be gr&eacute;edier: and fur|ther &s;ent worde by &s;ound of drumme, that all her companies &s;hould be readie the next day early in the morning, to giue a&s;|&s;ault vnto the citie. Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Calafre</HI> hauing in this maner proui|ded for her enterpri&s;e, at the time appointed all her women ar|med according to their manner (the mo&s;t part of them bearing bowes) ranne with great furie vnto the walles, and with their ladders began to mount vp: with that the alarme went about the citie, all men running to defend the &s;ame: and as they were &s;ome vpon the walles and other places of defence, the Qu&eacute;ene made &s;igne to let the Griffons loo&s;e, which being hungry and fly|ing ouer the towne, &s;eazed vpon &s;uch as they could find abroad: wherewith the Emperours &s;ouldiers were in &s;o great feare, that mo&s;t part of them that fought, for&s;ooke the walles to hide them|&s;elues. Alas what pitie was it to &s;&eacute;e &s;ouldiers, citizens, knights,
<PB REF="124"> and others, yea women and little children, and all what&s;oeuer they could get into their clawes taken vp into the aire, and &s;om|times hauing taken them vp, they let them fall vpon the &s;tones, whereby they had a &s;trange and cruell death: &s;urely if God had not kept the Cittie better than tho&s;e that had the charge, it is mo&s;t &s;ure it had b&eacute;ene taken at that time. But there happened a &s;trange ca&s;e, for as the Griffons helde their prey, and that the Knights of great Brittaine with &s;ome &s;mall number of others, re&s;i&s;ted the a&s;&s;ault made by the women, the Turkes (that had b&eacute;en aduerti&s;ed not to come out of their tents while they a&s;&s;ailed the towne) mooued with too gr&eacute;edy a de&s;ire to &s;acke the Citte which they thought &s;urely had b&eacute;en taken, ranne vnto the a&s;&s;ault making &s;uch a noi&s;e, that the Griffons (f&eacute;eding on their preyes) left the bodies they had &s;eazed vpon, and flying vp againe, &s;ea&s;ed on them that they &s;awe come running to the towne, whereof in &s;hort &s;pace after they made &s;o great a butcherie, that more than foure hundred Turkes were pre&s;ently &s;laine by them: meane time tho&s;e within the towne perceiuing that good fortune, did &s;o fiercely repul&s;e the Californiens, that their principall women lay dead within the ditches: wherewith the Qu&eacute;ene was forced to retire, knowing her enterpri&s;e would not take effect as &s;h&eacute;e de&s;ired it &s;hould, not by rea&s;on of her &s;ouldiers, but in that they kept not in as they had promi&s;ed. Wherewith &s;he commanded to take the birdes againe, but the Falconers could not by any meanes make them to come in, before they had &s;laine and deuou|red aboue a thou&s;and Turkes and others, whereof they onely &s;uckt the blood. Wherewith king <HI>Armato</HI> and the Souldan of Liquie were &s;o grieued, that from thenceforth they began to &s;hew &s;o hard a countenance to the Qu&eacute;ene, that &s;h&eacute;e was in the minde to returne into her countrey, not offering from that time once to giue &s;troke with &s;word to their aduantage. Yet not long after &s;h&eacute;e was appea&s;ed, and fought with King <HI>Ama|dis,</HI> as it &s;hall b&eacute;e &s;hewed you at large in the end of this our fift Booke. And that w&eacute;e may haue the better meanes to attaine thereto, w&eacute;e will now returne againe vnto the Chri&s;tian Princes, that a&s;&s;embled their powers and forces to helpe the
<PB REF="125"> Emperour, imbarking them&s;elues as pre&s;ently you &s;hall heare. But before they arriued at Con&s;tantinople, many good knights both of great Brittaine and others were &s;laine within the citie, not onely in the a&s;&s;aultes made again&s;t it by the Pagans, but at the la&s;t a&s;&s;ault made by the qu&eacute;ene <HI>Calafre,</HI> among the which, none were &s;o much lamented as <HI>Ledarin de Faiarque, Trys, Imo|&s;ill</HI> of Burgundie, and the two &s;onnes of the gyant <HI>Balan.</HI></P>

<P>_IF you haue read the di&s;cour&s;e of this our hi&s;tory, it hath b&eacute;ene &s;hewed you before, how <HI>Enil</HI> went vnto the Emperour of Rome, and <HI>Flore&s;tan</HI> king of Sardaigne, and what became of <HI>Gandalin</HI> after he had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traights of Giberaltar, and en|tred in the Ocean &s;ea, euen to great Brit|taine and other places, where h&eacute;e found king <HI>Amadis</HI> and others, to whome he had charge to goe: Now we mu&s;t declare the re&s;t. You &s;hall therefore vnder&s;tand, that <HI>Gandalin</HI> hauing &s;oiourned eight daies in London, more by the commaundement of king <HI>Amadis</HI> and Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Oriane,</HI> than for the plea&s;ure that hee tooke in the woman they had cau&s;ed him to marrie, knowing the affaires wherein he had left his compani|ons, departed from thence, and trauailed &s;o long, that he arriued in Fraunce, and went vnto king <HI>Perion</HI> to whome he gaue the letters that his &s;onne and grand-child &s;ent vnto him: and withall declared the &s;tate of the Ea&s;t countries, as they then were, with the inconuenience that might fall vnto all Chri&s;tendome, if the Empire of Con&s;tantinople were in obedience to the infidels. So well could <HI>Gandalin</HI> tell his tale, that the good old king <HI>Perion</HI> mooued with a holy zeale, determined to go him&s;elfe in per&s;on,
<PB REF="125"> and to take with him great quantity of &s;hips and men, furni&s;hed for the wars. <HI>Gandalin</HI> &s;tayed not long with him, but while hee prepared him&s;elfe, hee went into Scotland, Norway, Sobradi&s;e, Denmarke and Sweathland, and did his Emba&s;&s;ages &s;o well, that all the Kings and Princes to whome hee went, determined with all &s;p&eacute;ede to aid <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> in &s;uch &s;ort, that in &s;hort time af|ter their &s;hips were ready, and tho&s;e of Sweathland, Norway, and Denmarke, come vnto the port of Suer, from whence &s;et|ting &s;aile, they coa&s;ted along Fre&s;eland, Holland, and Braband, till they arriued at Bulloigne, where king <HI>Perion</HI> had prepared great number of Ships, Hulkes, and other ve&s;&s;els: which being furni&s;hed with men, victuals, and munition nece&s;&s;arye for the warres, hoi&s;ed &s;aile and put to &s;ea. And coa&s;ting Normandie, came to little Brittaigne, where they ankered in S. <HI>Mathewes</HI> Hauen, where the Kings, <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> and <HI>Amadis</HI> accompanied of <HI>Grumedan</HI> and diuers other knights, were arriued to refre&s;h the~|&s;elues: hauing pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;le of Sorlingue, the Iri&s;h men imbar|ked them&s;elues at the cape Antiquan, and the Scots at cape Ba&s;|&s;o. And hauing &s;ailed the way that the Brittons had pa&s;t, ioined with the We&s;terne Princes that went that voiage, in &s;uch &s;ort, that within thr&eacute;e daies after they &s;et &s;aile, &amp; hauing a Northea&s;t wind, they di&s;couered the coa&s;t of Spaine, pa&s;&s;ing the Port of <HI>Fi|nis terre in compo&s;telle:</HI> after that the cape S. <HI>Vincent:</HI> &amp; draw|ing on the left &s;ide, they pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traights of Gibraltar, &amp; lea|uing Barbary and Guinde on the right hand, &s;ailed toward Ta|mar, Au&s;tora, and Lagarde, minding to leaue Maiorque &amp; Minor|que, to enter into y^e &s;traights of Bu&s;ina and Monaco, &amp; fro~ thence to &s;aile to the ports of Ele&s;e and Cor&s;e, where they met with <HI>Flo|re&s;tan</HI> king of Sardaigne &amp; his fl&eacute;et, but before they ariued there, fortune was &s;o contrary vnto them, that certaine of their Galli|ons could not follow the &s;hips, but &s;taied behind to the number of eight, being &s;o &s;cattered, y^t they made account they had been lo&s;t. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, the next day they arriued all at Port S. <HI>Luce,</HI> where without longer &s;taying they pa&s;&s;ed forward to go to Regi, where the army of the Emperor of Rome (comming from O&s;ty) lay at anker &s;taying for them. Where they continued &s;ix daies,
<PB REF="126"> not onely to take in fre&s;h water, but al&s;o to calke and mend their &s;hippes and other ve&s;&s;els that had n&eacute;ed: the &s;euenth day hauing a good wind, they hoy&s;ed ankers, and &s;etting &s;aile, coa&s;ted along the country of Morea, comming to cape de Malua&s;ie, where the winde fell &s;omewhat contrarie: but in the end the &s;ea waxing calme, put forward to Cape Calon, and the I&s;le of Negrepont: and entring into the Archipelago they di&s;couered the &s;ide of the cape Athos, till they approched Galiopi, leauing the Ile of Te|nedos, becau&s;e they would not be di&s;couered by the Turkes that <HI>Armato</HI> had &s;et there to k&eacute;epe a pa&s;&s;age for his victuals to b&eacute;e brought vnto the armie: where they &s;taied not long but they entred into the goulfe of Propontide, coa&s;ting Thrace, till they came vnto the Port of Salombre, which is not aboue thirtie miles from the citie of Con&s;tantinople, where they landed, that they might the better approch the Pagans campe: with that they agr&eacute;ed among them that king <HI>Childadan</HI> and <HI>Quedragant</HI> &s;hould be Generals of the armie by &s;ea: and hauing left &s;uffici|ent number of men for the furni&s;hing and &s;afe k&eacute;eping of their &s;hippes, their fl&eacute;et &s;ailed towards Con&s;tantinople, hoping to &s;et vpon <HI>Alphorax</HI> and his armie by &s;ea before they &s;hould perceiue them. But it fell out otherwi&s;e, for the Turkes that had &s;pies in all places, di&s;couered them, not &s;uffering <HI>Alphorax</HI> to fight, de|&s;iring him mo&s;t earne&s;tly onely to k&eacute;epe the entrie of the &s;traits to take all meanes from the towne to be victualled on that &s;ide. Which king <HI>Childadan</HI> and <HI>Quedragant</HI> vnder&s;tanding, would not hazzard them&s;elues, but ankered within halfe a myle of the enemie, &s;taying for king <HI>Lui&s;art,</HI> the Emperour of Rome, and tho&s;e that marched by land, meane time giuing diuers &s;kirmi|&s;hes to the enemie with their Pinnaces, but <HI>Alphorax</HI> for all that would not leaue his hole, lying as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ibly he could: on the other &s;ide <HI>Armato</HI> and his company being aduerti&s;ed of the great aid that came towards the towne, cau&s;ed their forces to a&s;|&s;emble, determining to k&eacute;ep the &s;ide of the great &s;ea, by y^e which they might ea&s;ilier recouer victuals, as well from Natolia as out of Tartaria. The kings <HI>Amadis, Perion,</HI> &amp; others made &s;uch ha&s;t, that the ninth day after they incamped them&s;elues in y^e &s;ight
<PB REF="126"> of Con&s;tantinople right before their enemies, in a place that &s;&eacute;e|med mo&s;t conuenient. But if the Pagans at the fir&s;t were much aba&s;hed to &s;&eacute;e tho&s;e &s;uccours, the Emperor &amp; tho&s;e within y^e town were not much le&s;&s;e, doubting it had b&eacute;en &s;ome new forces come again&s;t the towne: for they had not any intelligence of the &s;en|ding of <HI>Gandalin</HI> &amp; <HI>Enil</HI> to the chri&s;tian princes, that brought with them a multitude both of &s;hips &amp; men, as well knights as others. Now to returne to the Chri&s;tians fl&eacute;et: King <HI>Childadan</HI> know|ing that <HI>Alphorax</HI> plaied the foxe, de&s;ired <HI>Quedragant</HI> (hauing equall power with him) to be content that he with thr&eacute;e&s;core pin|naces might &s;kirmi&s;h with him, that thereby if it were po&s;&s;ible, he might prouoke him to come out, which he agr&eacute;ed vnto: where|fore &s;etting &s;aile, he made towards the enemie, &s;o n&eacute;ere, that they were ready to fight hand to hand: neuertheles <HI>Alphorax</HI> for that time would not touch the bait, but entred farther in the &s;traights: wherewith king <HI>Childadan</HI> retired, and came vnto the hauen of the citie, making the braue&s;t &s;how that might be &s;&eacute;ene: tho&s;e of Con&s;tantinople perceiuing the bandirols and &s;treamers of great Brtttain &amp; of other chri&s;tian princes, made him an&s;wer with the like, and &s;o high, that the noi&s;e of the trumpets, clerons, &amp; tabers was &s;o great, that <HI>Armato</HI> and all the Pagans might ea&s;ily hear it. With that king <HI>Childadan</HI> was receiued by the Emperor, <HI>No|randel,</HI> &amp; others, to whome he &s;hewed what aide was come vnto them, and what princes had taken the voiage in hand. In good faith (&s;aid the Emperor) they bind me for euer vnto them, yet am I much aba&s;hed how they vnder&s;tood of the wars betw&eacute;ene <HI>Ar|mato</HI> &amp; me. What? my Lord (&s;aid <HI>Childadan</HI>) did <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> neuer tell you therof? No I a&s;&s;ure you (&s;aid the Emperor) nor any of his companions, as far as I know. Is he not in the city (&s;aid y^e king?) In good truth (&s;aid <HI>Norandel</HI>) hee would not leaue the ca&s;tle <HI>La montaigne defendu,</HI> minding to k&eacute;ep it, if the Pagans came to be|&s;iege it. A&s;&s;ure your &s;elues (&s;aid <HI>Childadan</HI>) he will not long &s;tay there before king <HI>Amadis</HI> &s;endeth for him: for we determine pre|&s;ently to giue battell, &amp; if he &s;hould faile at &s;uch a iourny, it would gr&eacute;eue him euer after.

<P>This letter giuen to the Gentlewoman that bare the fir&s;t to <HI>Norandel,</HI> &s;he went vnto the Chri&s;tians campe, and being aduer|ti&s;ed which was <HI>Amadis</HI> tent, entered therein, as he &s;ate talking with king <HI>Lui&s;art, E&s;plandian,</HI> and other good knights. Where kn&eacute;eling on the ground, &s;he a&s;ked which of them was the knight of the great Serpent and his father. <HI>Amadis</HI> &s;pake vnto her and &s;aied: Gentlewoman, I am the one, and this is my &s;onne. Is it your plea&s;ure to &s;peake with vs? The gentlewoman ca&s;ting hir eie vpon <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> maruelling at his great beautie, &s;pake &amp; &s;aid: In good faith king <HI>Amadis,</HI> I verily bel&eacute;eue that this is hee, for I haue heard him in diuers places e&s;t&eacute;emed for the &s;ame that nowe I doe behold in him. Gentlewoman (&s;aid <HI>Amadis</HI>) if you came in|to our camp only to &s;&eacute;e him, you now haue your de&s;ire. That hath not ben only the cau&s;e (&s;aid &s;he) but to bring this letter which the Souldan of Liquie and Qu&eacute;en <HI>Calafre</HI> &s;end vnto you both: wher|fore hauing read it, I pray you returne an an&s;were. With that (<HI>Amadis</HI> hauing taken it in his hand) the Gentlewoman depar|ted out of the tent, attending their re&s;olution. King <HI>Amadis</HI> ha|uing read it, &s;hewed it to King <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> and the re&s;t that were in pre&s;ence, wherewith there ro&s;e great controuer&s;ie among them concerning the refu&s;all or acceptation of the combat, for that the mo&s;t part of them were of adui&s;e it &s;hould not be accepted, &s;hew|ing diuers great and euident rea&s;ons to confirm the &s;ame, as the greater number of enemies they had before them readye to giue them battaile, &amp; if it happen (&s;aid they) that fortune &s;hould be con|trary to king <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> (in whome partly con&s;i&s;teth our hope) &s;uch hard chance would br&eacute;ed great fear in diuers men
<PB REF="128" MS="y"> that are now very willing &amp; ready to do the be&s;t they can. Others held the contrary, &s;aying that it would be &s;hame vnto them al, for that that refu&s;al only would much incourage the enemy, but they were of this opinion, that it might wel be required that the num|ber of the combatants might be greater. In good truth (&s;aie <HI>Ama|dis</HI>) be it of two again&s;t two, twenty again&s;t twenty, or of grea|ter number, the victory is in the hands of God. Wherefore in re|fu&s;ing thereof, I &s;hould doe my &s;elfe wrong, and cau&s;e a great ble|mi&s;h to all Chri&s;tendome, that would not be defaced in long time after. Be&s;ides I haue great hope of Gods helpe herein, for who&s;e faith and honour I haue vndertaken this voiage. When <HI>E&s;plan|dian</HI> heard his fathers mind, he &s;pake boldlier and &s;aid: That he would take that combate vpon him&s;elfe alone, not onely again&s;t the Souldan and the Qu&eacute;ene, but again&s;t two others more with them, rather then it &s;o &s;hould be refu&s;ed: whereupon it was con|cluded, that <HI>Amadis</HI> and he would fight, and &s;ending for the me&s;|&s;enger into the tent, <HI>Amadis</HI> &s;aied vnto her: Gentlewoman, you &s;hall tel the Souldan and the Qu&eacute;ene that I and my &s;on are con|tent to doe as they require, wherefore let them chu&s;e what arms they will, and for the place it &s;hall bee betw&eacute;ene their campe and ours: a&s;&s;uring them on the faith of a king, that not one of our &s;ol|diours &s;hall once remoue, how &s;oeuer we &s;p&eacute;ed, which wee de&s;ire likewi&s;e at their hands: and if it b&eacute;e their de&s;ire to haue the com|bate fought this day, we are content to doe it. With that the gen|tlewoman returned, and comming to the Souldans tent, &s;h&eacute;e de|clared her me&s;&s;age vnto the~, being &s;uch as you haue heard: wher|of the Souldan was glad, but e&s;pecially the Qu&eacute;ene, for the great de&s;ire &s;he had to &s;&eacute;e <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> wherefore &s;hee a&s;ked the Gentle|woman what &s;he thought of him. Madame (&s;aied &s;hee) I haue in my life time &s;&eacute;ene many men and women that nature had indued with great beautie, but by the gods I confe&s;&s;e it is all but pain|ting in regard of that I haue found in him: for hee is &s;o faire and beautifull, that the more I thinke thereon, &s;o much the more it maketh me co~ceiue &s;uch beauty to be rather deuine the~ humane. That is much (&s;aid the Qu&eacute;ene.) I know not (&s;aid the gentlewo|man) what you meane by that word Much, but I am wel a&s;&s;ured,
<PB REF="129"> if you had &s;&eacute;ene him as I did, that you would &s;ay as much as I doe, and it may be more. Truly (&s;aied the Qu&eacute;ene) before I enter in combat with him, I will fir&s;t &s;&eacute;e him vnarmed, and &s;peak with him, not as an enemie to an enemy, but as friends commonly do one vnto the other. Madame (&s;aied the Souldan) &s;&eacute;eing it is your de&s;ire, it were good our Gentlewoman went againe vnto them, to de&s;ire them to giue you leaue to come and vi&s;ite them in their campe, not to procure them any cau&s;e of enuy, but to do them ho|nour: and for that cau&s;e to de&s;ire their &s;afe conduct. This coun|&s;ell &s;&eacute;emed good vnto the Qu&eacute;ene, and without longer &s;taying &s;he &s;ent the Gentlewoman backe againe vnto <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandi|an</HI> whom &s;he found yet in the Tent whereas &s;he left them. With that &s;he told them what her me&s;&s;age was, and the great de&s;ire the Qu&eacute;ene had to &s;&eacute;e them before they entred into combat. King <HI>A|madis</HI> could not refraine laughing to hear the Gentlewoman ex|pre&s;&s;e the affection her mi&s;tre&s;&s;e had, a&s;king king <HI>Lui&s;art</HI> what he thought therein. Sonne (&s;aied hee) deny not her reque&s;t, for I a&s;|&s;ure you (&s;ince our comming hether) I haue heard the Qu&eacute;ene to b&eacute;e e&s;t&eacute;emed a wi&s;e and beautifull Prince&s;&s;e. You heare our an|&s;were (&s;aied <HI>Amadis</HI> to the Gentlewoman) let the Qu&eacute;ene come hether when &s;he thinketh good, for &s;he &s;hall be heartely welcome. With that the Gentlewoman returned to the Qu&eacute;ene, who be|ing greatly plea&s;ed with that an&s;were, determined the next daye to goe vnto them. But &s;he knew not well what manner of appa|rell &s;he were be&s;t to weare: &s;ometimes &s;hee thought it fit to goe as &s;he v&s;ed when &s;he went to bataile, and then pre&s;ently changed opinion, thinking a womans apparrell would bee more &s;&eacute;emely and conuenient, &s;&eacute;eing &s;he went not to trie their forces, but only to win the loue and fauour of <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> if &s;he might procure the &s;ame. And thinking on it all night long, in the morning when &s;he meant to apparrell her &s;elf, &s;he was re&s;olued to dre&s;&s;e her as wo|men v&s;e to do, thinking &s;he had means inough afterward to &s;hew her &s;elfe in habite of a knight, whereby &s;hee might bee &s;&eacute;ene both in the one and the other &s;ort. Whervpon &s;he cau&s;ed her mo&s;t pre|cious robes to be brought vnto her, and apparrelling her &s;elf, for|got not any thing that might once beautifie or adorn her per&s;on,
<PB REF="129"> or that in her opinion would deck her well, the better to be liked. And to bear her company &s;he tooke twelue of her own gentlewo|men, &s;o well furni&s;hed and &s;et forth with &s;tones and pearles, that the like was neuer &s;&eacute;ene. That done, &s;he &s;ent vnto her &s;hips for a mo&s;t &s;trange and mon&s;trous bea&s;t, wherevpon &s;ometimes &s;hee v&s;ed to ride in great pomp. It was as big as a great Dromadary, the hair long &amp; &s;omewhat yellow, black &s;pots, his two eares han|ging downe vnto his kn&eacute;es, hauing but one eye, &s;hining brighter then a burning gla&s;&s;e, and &s;tood right in the mid&s;t of his forehead: out of his mouth there i&s;&s;ued two great t&eacute;eth like hornes, and al|though his f&eacute;et were clouen like an ox, yet was there no Hart in all the world y^t could outrun him, were it in plaine way, or ouer rockes. In that manner &s;he entered into the Chri&s;tans campe, of whom &s;he was not a little wondred at before &s;hee came to King <HI>Lui&s;arts</HI> tent, where <HI>Amadis</HI> and in a maner all the principal cap|taines of the army &s;taied for her, praying <HI>Quedragant</HI> to goe out to welcome her, which he did with great courte&s;ie: for he had no &s;ooner e&s;pied her, but hee &s;tepped forward, and doing her great re|uerence, holpe her to di&s;cend, and taking her by the arme, led her into the tent, where the lords were all a&s;&s;embled, of whome &s;hee was mo&s;t honourably receiued. But when &s;he beheld <HI>E&s;plandians</HI> beauty, &s;he was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed with the loue of him, y^t &s;hee re|pented her comming thether, not &s;o much for the &s;mall hope &s;hee had to win him, (being diuers in religion) but doubting y^t the fan|ta&s;y newly entred into hir mind would &s;o much e&s;trange hir force (by ouermuch thinking vpon him) when &s;he went to fight, y^t ther|by &s;he &s;hould be in danger to lo&s;e the honour and reputation &s;hee had gotten in arms among the be&s;t knights in all y^e world: which to preuent, &s;hee determined to &s;tay the le&s;&s;e time there, knowing the nature of loue to bee &s;uch, y^t it can &s;teale the hearts of all per|&s;ons, and commonly maketh him&s;elfe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, before hee that hath it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, can perceaue it. And as the Princes entertained her with diuers &s;w&eacute;ete and plea&s;ant &s;p&eacute;eches, &s;hee tourned to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> and &s;aied: Sir Knight, for two mo&s;t ex|cellent graces that are in you, I haue taken the paines to
<PB REF="130"> come and vi&s;ite you: The fir&s;t is the gift of beauty, which is &s;uch in you, as I could neuer haue imagined the &s;ame: The other is the force of your body and magnanimity of your courage, where|by you are accounted altogether inuincible. The one I haue &s;&eacute;en with mine eies to be &s;o perfect, that I neuer hope to &s;&eacute;e the like a|gaine, although I liued a thou&s;and yeares and more: the other, y^e combat you &s;hal haue again&s;t the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant Souldan of Li|quie will be a witne&s;&s;e vnto vs: and had it not ben that h&eacute;e reque|&s;ted me to fight again&s;t king <HI>Amadis</HI> (becau&s;e his onely de&s;ire is to prooue his body again&s;t yours) I would haue tried it my &s;elfe. Of one thing can I wel a&s;&s;ure you, that if the honour remaine to vs and life to you, I will afterward tel you a thing that much im|porteth me, and which I greatly de&s;ire to let you know before I &s;aile into my countrey. Now for this time I haue &s;ati&s;fied my de|&s;ire: wherefore my lords (&s;aid &s;he vnto all the Princes) I be&s;&eacute;ech you pardon me in not v&s;ing longer &s;p&eacute;eches, for I know full well that my long &s;taying with you, (thinking to finde that I hoped for) might po&s;&s;ible cau&s;e me to lo&s;e my &s;elfe, wherewith I &s;hould be ouermuch di&s;plea&s;ed, for that before &s;unne&s;etting I hope to b&eacute;e in place where I will &s;hew &s;uch valour in armes, that hee which neuer could be vanqui&s;hed by man (as it is reported) &s;hal now re|ceiue an ouerthrow at a &s;imple womans hand. Madame (&s;aied king <HI>Perion</HI>) fortune can doe much when it plea&s;eth her, if you do as you &s;ay, truly you &s;hall doe more then we can well bel&eacute;eue, but commonly y^e workman is known by his worke, and becau&s;e the i&s;&s;ue of the combat is the glory of him or you, til then we wil defer our iudgements. And although <HI>Amadis</HI> perceiued him&s;elfe much outraged by the qu&eacute;en, yet he made no &s;ign thereof, but taking her by y^e arm, led her where her company &s;taied, and as &s;h&eacute;e mounted to return, with a &s;miling countenance he &s;pake vnto her and &s;aid: Madame, whe~ we come to dealing of blowes I be&s;&eacute;ech you &s;hew me not the greate&s;t extremity you can, becau&s;e I was alwaies a friend to women, and euer will be during my life: wherevnto the qu&eacute;en an&s;wered not a word, but rode vnto y^e Pagans camp to arm hir &s;elfe. Mean time <HI>Brian de Monia&s;te</HI> arriued in the Chri&s;tians camp, who hauing ben &s;ent by the king of Spain his father with
<PB REF="130"> a great power of men into Africa, to be&s;iege the town of Ce&s;onie after called Centie, was aduerti&s;ed by a pirate, of the Chri&s;tians enterpri&s;e, and how their army and great fl&eacute;et had pa&s;&s;ed the cape of <HI>Finis terre,</HI> pre&s;ently &s;ent vnto his father to de&s;ire him to giue him leaue to goe that voiage: whereunto by much importunitie he granted.

<P>_QV&eacute;ene <HI>Calafre</HI> returned to the Pagans campe as you heard before, pre&s;ently armed her &s;elfe, &amp; the Souldan like wi&s;e, and &s;tayed not long before they came vnto the place where the combat was a&s;&s;igned, where not long after they found <HI>Ama|dis</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian:</HI> and becau&s;e the two campes were not well a&s;&s;ured of each other (notwith&s;tanding the oathes and promi&s;es on both &s;ides made) they &s;et them&s;elues in order of battaile not &s;tirring one foot: king <HI>Perion</HI> &s;ending word to <HI>Que|dragant</HI> and king <HI>Childadan,</HI> that as they had intelligence from the enemy, they &s;hould &s;et vpon their armie by &s;ea: the like word was &s;ent vnto the Emperour of Con&s;tantinople, that he might likewi&s;e be prepared: and as the foure combatants were ready to &s;trike each other, the Souldan called <HI>Amadis</HI> and <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> a&s;king them if they would not &s;weare and k&eacute;epe promi&s;e (accor|ding to the agr&eacute;ement &s;ent vnto them by his gentlewoman) that the vanqui&s;hers without impeachment &s;hould lead away the vanqui&s;hed. I truly, &s;aid they, therefore beware of vs. With that <HI>Amadis</HI> made towards the Qu&eacute;ene, and the Souldan again&s;t <HI>E&s;|plandian,</HI>
<PB REF="131"> to whome he gaue &s;o great a blow with his launce into the &s;hield, that he pierced it through: wherby diuers thought a&s;|&s;uredly he had b&eacute;en wounded to death, but it was not &s;o, for the launce pa&s;&s;ed vnder his &s;addle without any further hurt: but <HI>E&s;|plandian</HI> gaue him his exchange, &s;triking him &s;o fiercely, that h&eacute;e made him loo&s;e both &s;tirrop and &s;addle and fall vpon the ground, with &s;o great might, that he rolled twice or thrice before he &s;tay|ed, in &s;uch manner, that the helmet flew off his head. Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Calafre</HI> ranne again&s;t king <HI>Amadis,</HI> and he again&s;t her: and as they were in the middle of their cour&s;e, <HI>Amadis</HI> turned the but end of his launce again&s;t her, &amp; pa&s;&s;ing forward would not &s;trike her: yet &s;h&eacute;e held her launce downe and &s;trake his hor&s;e in the &s;t&eacute;ele of his forehead, and withall they met &s;o &s;trongly body to body, that therewith the Qu&eacute;ene fell downe, &amp; <HI>Amadis</HI> was con|&s;trained to light, his hor&s;e was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed with the truncheon of the launce that &s;tucke within his forehead. But the Qu&eacute;ene ro&s;e pre&s;ently, and with her &s;word in hand went towards <HI>Ama|dis,</HI> the like did the Souldan to <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> that had &s;uffered him to take breath and lace his helmet, not for any good he wi&s;hed him, but that at the end of his carere h&eacute;e e&s;pied the princes <HI>Leonorine</HI> &s;tanding on the walles of Con&s;tantinople, whereat he was &s;o aba&s;hed, that euery man &s;aide, the Souldan had hurt him in the bodie. Neuerthele&s;&s;e within &s;hort &s;pace after they knew the con|trarie: for h&eacute;e lighted on foote, where betw&eacute;ene them two was fought the mo&s;t perillous combat that euer was &s;&eacute;ene, for <HI>Rodri|gue</HI> was as valiant a knight in armes as any in his time: but <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> handled him in &s;uch manner, that often times he made him cleane forget the &s;ubtilties that commonly he v&s;ed in &s;uch affaires, and in the end v&s;ed him &s;o hardly, that it might euident|ly be &s;&eacute;ene the victorie would be his. Meane time the Qu&eacute;ene v|&s;ed all her force to ouercome king <HI>Amadis,</HI> who holding in his hand a great truncheon of a launce in&s;tead of a &s;word, gaue her &s;uch a blowe on the cre&s;t of her helmet, that h&eacute;e made her eyes &s;tart within her head. Wherewith &s;h&eacute;e being much offended, &s;pake vnto him, and &s;aid: What &s;ir Knight? doe you thinke me either to he a dogge or el&s;e a countrey clowne, that you &s;&eacute;eme to

You account m&eacute;e then (&s;aid the Qu&eacute;ene) one of that number: but you &s;hall pre|&s;ently f&eacute;ele that I am &s;omething more: with that &s;h&eacute;e tooke her &s;word in both handes, and in great choller gaue him &s;uch a blow, that &s;h&eacute;e claue his &s;hield in two, and thinking to double her &s;troke, <HI>Amadis</HI> &s;tepped vnto her and plucked hers from off her necke, with &s;uch force, that &s;h&eacute;e was con&s;trained to kn&eacute;ele vpon the ground.

<P>_THe ob&s;equies and funerals of the Kinges, Princes, Lords and others, that died in the battell, being fini&s;hed, the wounded cu|red, and all things &s;et at re&s;t: the Empe|rour of Con&s;tantinople knowing that <HI>A|madis</HI> and tho&s;e that were come with him from the We&s;terne parts would retourne againe into their countries, de&s;ired them to a&s;&s;emble, &s;hewing them that his meaning was to let them know what h&eacute;e determined to doe before they went from thence: The next day in the morning they all met in the emperors great hall, and he &s;tanding in the midde&s;t, &s;pake vnto them and &s;aid: My brethren, lords, and good friends, the bond wherein I &s;tand boun|den vnto you is &s;o great, y^t although it hath plea&s;ed God to make me Emperour of all Grecia, yet am I well a&s;&s;ured, it is far be|yond my poore hability to &s;ati&s;fie you for the &s;ame, e&s;t&eacute;eming the honour and riches that I now haue (next vnder God) be it little or much, to proc&eacute;ed from you: I am now thr&eacute;e&s;core yeares of age, wholly aged &amp; decrepit, by rea&s;on of the paines that in my youth|full yeares I haue continually taken in following armes: &s;o it is I haue but one child, which is a daughter, the onely &s;taffe &amp; hope of my old yeares, whome I haue determined (if you thinke good) to giue in marriage vnto the valiant knight <HI>E&s;plandian,</HI> and with her likewi&s;e to inue&s;t him with the Empire and gouernement of all my countries. And the better to liue &s;olitarily, and to &s;eperate my &s;elfe from worldly company, I haue determined to goe (with the Empre&s;&s;e my wife) into the mona&s;tery that I cau&s;ed to bee made, there to liue religiou&s;ly, calling vpon God and doing pen|nance for the euils I haue committed heretofore.

My lord (&s;aid he) my &s;onne &s;hal doe as you command him.

My lord (&s;aid &s;he) not long before <HI>Melie</HI> be|traied <HI>Vrganda,</HI> &s;he and I being alone in my chamber, &s;he &s;ent to fetch one of the bookes that had ben taken from her, couered with gold, whereon the Enchauntre&s;&s;e was ingrauen, and I remem|ber that I &s;aw therein the like carracters that <HI>E&s;plandian</HI> beareth on his body, and ouer them their &s;ignification, which is nothing el&s;e but his name and mine.
