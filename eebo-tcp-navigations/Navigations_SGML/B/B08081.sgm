<HEAD>A POETICALL SEA-PEICE:</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SO &s;pake the &s;tormy fiend; who&s;e work it was,</L>
<L>To vex the aer, and &s;eas as &s;moothe as gla&s;&s;e,</L>
<L>To roll on heaps till they on end doe &s;tand,</L>
<L>Where they again&s;t the windes doe breaking band,</L>
<L>And lift at heaven, and in their rangeing race,</L>
<L>Twixt ridg and ridg the deep engulphing &s;pace,</L>
<L>Appeares like jawes infernall, mouthes of hell,</L>
<L>To &s;wallow whole Fleets whole, none left to tell,</L>
<L>The lo&s;&s;es hapning in tho&s;e liquid graves.</L>
<L>Thus while the windes doe tyranni&s;e the waves,</L>
<L>Great clapps of thunder break from thickned skie,</L>
<L>And &s;hafts of lightning through the region flie,</L>
<L>And flie at randon, which more terrour breed:</L>
<L>They onely happy who were &s;trucken dead.</L>
<L>The wilde &s;eas madded thus, in their affray,</L>
<L>Doe threaten with their da&s;h to put out day.</L>
<L>The rocks in &s;ight would faine have &s;hrunck the head,</L>
<L>The hidden to be &s;eene in vaine doe dread.</L>
<L>The battred &s;hores had almo&s;t yeelded back,</L>
<L>The waves &s;o litle of their wils did lack:</L>
<L>And but for bounds the worlds creatour fixt,</L>
<L>All th' elements had once again been mixt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Mariner, when fir&s;t the &s;torm began,</L>
<L>By known &s;ignes taught to feare, looks pale and wan,</L>
<L>His &s;ailes takes in, and &s;toups unto that ill,</L>
<L>He cannot ma&s;ter, and with &s;ighes doth fill,</L>
<L>The deafe, and angry heavens, from who&s;e offen&s;e,</L>
<L>The per&s;ecution came, permitted thence.</L>
<L>For otherwi&s;e an ho&s;t of &s;pirits want powr,</L>
<L>To &s;tirre a breath, or &s;train a &s;lender &s;howr.</L>
<L>The &s;prinkling of the breaking waves beget,</L>
<L>Somewhat like rain, and which as much doth wet.</L>
<L>Yet fell rain al&s;o in &s;o va&s;t a &s;tore,</L>
<L>As had the windes &s;lept, and the waves no more,</L>
<L>Been &s;tirring then the windes, and force did u&s;e,</L>
<L>Which might, the &s;hip it &s;unck not, bulge, and brui&s;e:</L>
<L>Like chorus between acts &s;o came the rain,</L>
<L>Peal after peal, then tragick &s;torms again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away goes &s;teerage, and the lead away,</L>
<L>All cour&s;es fail, no road is near, nor bay.</L>
<L>Away the card, away the compa&s;&s;e goes:</L>
<L>In two and thirty points not one point &s;howes,</L>
<L>A line of &s;afety, all the lines that were,</L>
<L>Did point to death, none other center there.</L>
<L>And if AMALFI had at that time found,</L>
<L>The load&s;tones u&s;e, the needle turning round,</L>
<L>Vpon no corner could have faln &s;o true,</L>
<L>As to direct from whence le&s;&s;e danger grew.</L>
<L>The &s;taff wherewith the height they wont to take,</L>
<L>Now when each &s;ea over the &s;hip doth rake,</L>
<L>Surges whelm &s;urges, billowes doe billowes ride,</L>
<L>(The &s;ea-race running counter to the tide)</L>
<L>Vnu&s;efull is, nor fit a &s;tep to &s;tay,</L>
<L>When rocking &s;hips the reeling drunkards play,</L>
<L>And di&s;engorge the &s;eas &s;urcharging wa&s;te,</L>
<L>At gu&s;hing &s;cuppet-holes, which &s;eem to ca&s;te.</L>
<L>The dancing beak-head now doth plunge, and dive,</L>
<L>Then up again before the winde doth drive,</L>
<L>And while upright it &s;tands upon the &s;lide,</L>
<L>The naked bottom may be halfway eyd.</L>
<L>No place for art is left, no place for might,</L>
<L>And every way be&s;t plea&s;eth but the right.</L>
<L>For they the windes mu&s;t follow not their will.</L>
<L>Obedience was their be&s;t, and that was ill.</L>
<L>To minde then fir&s;t life pa&s;t hath &s;wift recour&s;e,</L>
<L>Then fir&s;t the feare of death doth &s;tir remor&s;e,</L>
<L>Awakens memory, repre&s;ents things done:</L>
<L>And they who labourd riches to have wonne,</L>
<L>By deaths contempt, would all the world now give,</L>
<L>To be but &s;afe on &s;hore, and &s;o to live.</L>
<L>The&s;e were the &s;ports of that outragious fiend:</L>
<L>On whom a rabble of his likes attend,</L>
<L>Alike perdues, alike forlorn as he,</L>
<L>But le&s;&s;e in power, in malice, and degree.</L>
<L>Some ball up clouds to ramme into the winde,</L>
<L>Others new bla&s;ts doe labour to unbinde,</L>
<L>And on their backs come feircely riding in,</L>
<L>Before the old ones to &s;urcea&s;e begin,</L>
<L>And with their on&s;ets violate the skie,</L>
<L>And betweene whiles doe whole broad-&s;ides let flie.</L>
<L>The Vultures, Harpyes, and all birds of praey,</L>
<L>Took &s;anctuarie far upon &s;hore away:</L>
<L>Their element is now no longer theirs.</L>

<LG>
<L>He had a coat full threefold thicke of bra&s;&s;e,</L>

<L>As had that man of CRETE, from who&s;e arts fame,</L>
<L>Choice peices carry the DAEDALEAN name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The &s;hips &s;ides crack, the tackle teres like thred:</L>
<L>Some plie the pump; &s;ome cry we all are dead.</L>
<L>Here climbes a nimble boy unto the top,</L>
<L>When him now halfway, or not halfway up,</L>
<L>A gu&s;t praevents, which ducks into the deep,</L>
<L>The &s;hrowds them&s;elves, &amp; from the ropes doth &s;weep</L>
<PB REF="3">
<L>The ventrous climer, darting him as farre,</L>
<L>As globe of &s;tone from in&s;trument of warre.</L>
<L>There, to &s;tand fa&s;t the one the other bindes,</L>
<L>And both are blown of with the hoi&s;ting windes:</L>

<L>Him bounding haches bandie to the deep.</L>
<L>Some tru&s;t unto the halliards, and their hold,</L>

<L>The giddy &s;hip the &s;ailers braines turnes round,</L>

<L>Throughout his bones, and out at either eie.</L>
<L>If any one le&s;&s;e &s;icklie were then &s;o,</L>

<L>No &s;tanding on the decks, no &s;tirring there;</L>
<L>Th' unbridled bea&s;t will now no ma&s;ter heare,</L>

<L>And as a load too heavie to dige&s;t,</L>
