<HEAD>A SHORT DECLARATION Of the Divi&s;ion, Situation &amp; Qualities of the EARTH.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Beginning did the Everla&s;ting and Almighty God, throug his wi&s;|dom, create the world out of nothing; and joyne the Earth with the Sea to|gether (as being the heavie&s;t) in one round forme, in the manner of a ball, and place them in the center or mid&s;t point, as in the nethermo&s;t place; the heaven, as a tent, is with an unmea&s;u|rable breadth extendeed, over and about it, and adorned with many and glorious lights, as the Sunne, Moone, Planets and other Starres innumerable. And that the earth might be a fit habitation or dwelling for man and other terre&s;trial creatures, and through its plentiful fruit nouri&s;h and &s;u&s;taine them, hath God exalted it above the waters, and ordained unto the Zea its place in the depths on &s;uch a manner, that &s;hee on every &s;ide comprehending the earth with its krookednes, doth di|&s;tingui&s;ch and divide the &s;ame in three &s;everal parts or great continents, that is firm lands, over which the de&s;cribers of the earth (as the A&s;tronomers over heaven) place fif circkels, as the Aequinoctial, &s;o called, becau&s;e night and day are over the whole earth off one length when&s;oever the Son doth come in this circkel, which happeneth about the 21^t^h^. of March, and the 23^t^h^. of September. This circkel is al&s;o called Aequator, to which when the Sunne commeth, it maketh the dayes &amp; the nights equal; the Marriners of the lowe countreys doe call it the middel-line, becau&s;e it doth divide the face of the earth in two equal parts, whereof one tendeth towards the North, and the other towards the South, &amp; &s;o it is the very middle be|twixt the Northern and Southern lines or Poles. The other is called Tropicus Cancri, or the Sunne turning of the Crab, be|cau&s;e the Sunne when it commeth to this cirkel about the 21^t^h^. of June, beginneth to turne towards the Aequator, and then it is the longe&s;t day to tho&s;e who live in the north, and the &s;horte&s;t to tho&s;e who live in the South from the Aequator: this circkels &s;ituated 23 degrees 31&frac12; minutes Northward from the middel|line. The third is tearmed Tropicus Capricorni, or a Sunne-turning of the &s;igne in the heaven, called Capricorne, becau&s;e the Sunne, when it comme to this circkel, which is about the 22^t^h^. of December, beginneth to turne and to klimbe towards the Aequator; and then it is contrary as before, the &s;horte&s;t day to tho&s;e who live in the North, and the longe&s;t to tho&s;e who live in the South of the mid-line: and this &s;igne is &s;ituated 23 degrees, 31&frac12; minuits in the South of the Aequinoctial. The 4^t^h^. is called Circulus Arcticus, the Northern cirkel, &amp; the 5^t^h^. Cir|culis Antarcticus, the Soutrhern cirkel: the&s;e are &s;ituated 23 de|grees 31&frac12; minutes, the one from the Northern, and the other from the Southern pole or diameter of the world, and are through the circumrotation of the heaven, de&s;cribed from the Pole of the Zodiak, or the cour&s;e of the Sunne. The ancient &amp; mo&s;t skilful A&s;tronomers under&s;tand by the Circulus Arcti|cus not onely this which is de&s;cribed; but &s;uch a circkel who&s;e half Diameter or line which goeth through the midle point, is even as much as the heyght of the pole from every place, com|prehending alwayes tho&s;e &s;tarres which before the heyght of every land never goe under, in which regard this circkel in all countreys which differ in breath, doth differ, as al&s;o from An|tarcticus: but in the afore&s;ayd de&s;cription wee follow the com|mon manner off the de&s;cribers off countreys. The earth is al&s;o through the aforenamed 4 la&s;t circkels, divided in 5 great re|gions, by the Grieck called Zonas, or girdels, becau&s;e that they in the form of girdels doe compa&s;&s;e the globe of the earth. The fir&s;t thereof is environed or enclo&s;ed within the Northern circ|kel, and beareth the name of the Northern colde region. The &s;econd is called the Southern colde region, running round a|bout the Southern Pole within the Southern circkel. The third, being the middelmo&s;t among&s;t them all, is called the barren and hot region, and is &s;ituated betweene two Circkels of the Cancer or Crab, &amp; the &s;igne of Capricornus. The 4^t^h^. is &s;ituated betwixt the Northern Circkel and the Circkel of the Crab, and is called the tempered Norther Region. The la&s;t called the Southerne temperate region, is &s;ituated betwixt the Circkel of Capricornus and the Southerne Circkel. The olde Philo&s;ophers and De&s;cribers of countreys did &s;uppo&s;e that off the&s;e few the two temperate alone where inhabited, and that of the other three, the two colde ones colde not be inhabited, in regard of the great intolerable colde, &amp; the barren hot region, in regard of the burning heat of the Sunne. But time in con|clu&s;ion hath produced, the truth thereof: &s;eing we have ex|perienced about 150 jears hence that they all are inhabited, but the colde lea&s;t of all, as Greenland, Y&s;land, Lapland, the utmo&s;t parts of Norway, and &s;uch like countreys. Experience likewi&s;e hath taught us that in the barnen, hot region the heat is not untolerable, neither doth it burne in &s;uch a manner as the Ancient conceived: fith there are found many excellent fruit|full and populous Kingdomes, as Gennee, Aethiope, Arabien, Ea&s;t-Indies, the famous Ilands Sumatra, Java and Molucquen, as al&s;o Bre&s;ilien, Peru, Nieuw-Spaine, and other &s;uch like countreys.</P>
<P>For to have the right under&s;tanding of the &s;ituation of coun|treys, wee mu&s;t knowe that the de&s;cribers of the earth calcu|late the &s;ame according to the degrees of length and breath. The breath of places (which is alwayes a like at the height of the Pole) is accounted from the midle line to be twofold, Northward or Southward to the number of ninety. The length is accounted from the Meridian-line, which runneth over the Pico de Tayda in the Iland Teneriffa, along de midle-line to|wards the Ea&s;t, to the number of 360, as for example, Am|&s;terdam is &s;ituated 52&frac12; from the midle-line towards the North, which is the breadth or the Poles heigth of the &s;ame city, and in the length 23 degrees, becau&s;e the &s;ame doth agree with &s;uch a degree of the Aequinoctial, calculating from the afore|&s;ayd Meridian. De Cabo de Bona E&s;peranca is &s;ituated on the breadth Southward from 34&frac12; degrees, and in the length from 42 degrees. The countreys or cities &s;ituated under the &s;ame length, have alwayes at one time and moment alike midday, and alike houre of the day: as when it is noonetide at Am&s;ter|dam, then it is al&s;o noonetide at Bergen in Norway, at Lions in France, at Algiers in Barbary, and &s;uch like places &s;ituated in one length. But tho&s;e which are &s;ituated under &s;everall degrees of length, differ likewi&s;e in the calculation of houres; &s;o that when it is midday in the forenamed places, then it is a Bantam in the Iland Java 7 houres and 12 minutes in the afternoone, becau&s;e the &s;ame city is &s;ituated 108 degrees in the length to|wards the Ea&s;t, for it differs every 15 degrees one houre; but in the city Lima, lying in Peru, it is 6 houres in the fore-noone, becau&s;e the &s;ame city is &s;ituated in the length about 90 degrees towards the We&s;t, as Am&s;terdam. Tho&s;e al&s;o which are &s;i|tuated under the like breadth or heigth of the Pole, have al|wayes alike length of dayes and nights: this is al&s;o to be under|&s;tood, that tho&s;e who live on the &s;outh&s;ide of the midle-line, have the &s;horte&s;t day, when we have the longe&s;t: as they have the Winter when we have the Sommer, and we the Winter, when they have the Sommer. But they which are &s;ituated un|der an unequal breadth or heigth of the Pole, have al&s;o une|qual length of dayes and nights: for the farter a place is &s;ituated from the midle-line, how the longe&s;t day is greater there, and the &s;horte&s;t les. As for example they wol live under the Aequi|noctial line, have day and nigt thorough the whole jeare alike long, without change. They who live on the breath of 30 de|grees, have the longe&s;t day almo&s;t of 14 houres: on the breath of 50 degrees, the longe&s;t day hath &s;tifly 16 houres. Under the Northern Circkel, which wee call Circules Arcticus, doth not the Sunne on the longe&s;t day, &s;et or goe under the Horizon. On the breadth of 70 degrees doth not the Sunne &s;et in 64 dayes: and &s;o following the longed dayes encrea&s;&s;e till under the Pole, wherein the whole jear not more is then one day and one night, each continuing one half jeare.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>Further more the Earth is divided ad this day in two great firm lands and parts, in <HI>Antiquam</HI> or olde and <HI>Novam</HI> or new America, called the new Worlde. The fir&s;t called the olde Worlde, becau&s;e it was onely knowne to the Ancient, have the ancient De&s;cribers of the Earth divided againe in tree parts to wit, in <HI>Europa, A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>EUROPA as &s;ome wil have it, hath its name from the Dochter of Agen, or King of Syrien, ravi&s;hed by Jupiter, which others e&s;teeme to be fabulous, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Ori|ginall of this name is unkowne. The territories of Europe in the We&s;t are the great Zea, in the &s;outh the Mediterranean Zea, in the Ea&s;t the Archipelage, Pontus Euxinus, or Maeotis Palus, and the right line a&s;cending thither wards the Nord to the River Dwyna, from whence the Ys-Sea doth wa&s;he again&s;t Europe. Albeit this part of the Worlde be very &s;mall in re&s;pect, of the other parts of the Earth, yet not with &s;tanding it is com|mended above all other Countreys for its &s;ingular vertuet, &amp; &s;pecially for the whole&s;om and temperate ayr, the fruytfulnes of the Earth, &amp; abundance of all other nece&s;&s;aries for the main|tenance of Mans-life; being watered with many fayre Rivers, and furni&s;hed with many hot and colde water-veynes or ba|things, effectual and fit for the expelling of &s;everall di&s;ea&s;es. Here grow no drugs not precious &s;tones, but abundance of Korne, Wine and als &s;ort of fayr tree-fruyt. Here are few cruel and pernitious bea&s;ts, but tame Creatures in a greater multitude and fayret then one where. Thoug that which this Countrey doth mo&s;t boa&s;t of, is the great multitude of its fayre, welbuilt &amp; populous cityes, which are here farre more in number, then in other parts of the earth. Europe hat formerly through the Monarchy of the Grecians and Romans, ruled as a Queene over the Countreys of A&s;ia &amp; Africa: al &s;hee yet doth at this day through the Mo&s;coviters and Turckes, as al&s;o throug the Ca&s;tilianen, Portugals and Hollanders, who have dominion over many places, countreys, Ilands, and potent Cities the|rein conteyned, and who doe &s;ubdue under theyr obedience almo&s;t whole America.</P>
<P>SPAYNE is the We&s;tern, &amp; therefore al&s;o the fir&s;t King|dom of Europe, of their inhabitans called E&s;panna, within name as al&s;o the People have theyr denomination and deriva|tion of certayn Province in A&s;ia, in former time called Pania, of pan who was Lord of the &s;ame. Spain is on all the 4 parts or &s;ide environed with the Zea, except on the North-ea&s;t-korner which is compa&s;&s;ed about with the Pyrenian hils, for a &s;eparation from Frans. 't Is a wonderful ble&s;&s;ed countrey, not onely in re&s;pect of fruytful ground, but al&s;o of an healthy ay|re; thence it is that there is &s;o faire a growth of Oyle, Sugar, Figs, Rai&s;ons, Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Pomegranats, Kappers, and other medicinal hearps; and above all &s;uch &s;trong and delicate &s;orte of Wine as any where are to be had. The worldly governement of Spayne con&s;i&s;teth in a King, never|theles he doth not conclude of any nomentany affairs without the advi&s;e of the 12, who one with an other make up the high Coun&s;el. The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical governement con&s;i&s;teth in Arch-Bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hop; the fir&s;t are ten in number, the other more then vifty. Spain in our time is gotten under one King, which was never &s;ien before in 800 yeares, notwith&s;tanding conteyningh 16 &s;everal Kingdoms as may be &s;eene in the Spani&s;h Titels: but Ca&s;tilien or Ca&s;tilie, Arragon and Portu|gal are the chiefe&s;t, under which all the other re&s;ort.</P>
<P>ARRAGON hath its denomination from the Province Tarroconen&s;is, in which it is &s;ituated, or from the city Tarragona. Its head or Mother-city is Sarago&s;&s;a, in former time called Cae&s;ar Augu&s;ta, placed on the river Ebro. In the mid&s;t of this Kingdome is Mon&s;on founded, wether the King once in three year doth re&s;ort in his owne Per&s;on, for the receyving of his revenues.</P>
<P>The third krowne of Spayne conteyneth the Kingdoms of Portugal and Algarven; Portugal is la&s;t of all joyned unto the other Spani&s;h Kingdoms. 't Is &s;uppo&s;ed that the revenues of the Kingdom import jearly two Millions of Ducats, which wealth doth mo&s;t ari&s;e from the great trade which the Portu|gals drive upon Ginee, Bra&s;il, and Portugals Indien; but the countrey is al&s;o fruytfull in it &s;elf, affording many &s;ortes of Wine, Oly, and other commodities. The mayne City of Portugal is Lisbon, &s;ituated on the River of Tajo, an excel|lent and great city of Marchandi&s;e.</P>
<P>FRANCE, the noble&s;t fruytful&s;t and mo&s;t potent King|dome of Europe, hath its name from the Frankes, a people of Germany, which 1200 years hence begin to conquer it. For the environing of this Kingdom is drawn in the North a line from Calis to the freedom of Straetsburgh; which line they of Artois, Henegou and Lutzenburg doe let lye on the left hand. In the We&s;t Frans doth beath on the Sea of Aquitanien, nou Gujenne, and partly on the Pyrrhenian hils, which fa&s;ten and joyne it to Spayn, in the South is bordereth on the Mediterra|nean Sea; in the Ea&s;t the high hils (called the Alpes) divide it from Italy, the hil Jura from Helvetia or Swit&s;erland, and the River Rheine from Germany. This countrey hath abundance of wheat and all other &s;orts of Korne, of Wine wee find here many &s;orts, and in &s;uch abundance, that it doth not onely &s;upply it &s;elf therewith, but al&s;o Engeland, Schotland, the Lowe Con|treys, and many other places be&s;ides, in the Southern parts of France is plenty of Oyle, Figs, Safferon there is ordinarely much kattel; wee finde there much Salt, Flax and Hemp. In this Kingdome are 14 Arch-Bis&s;hops, and above hundret Bis&s;hops. It is divided in 8 Parlaments or high Courts, to which the 21 head-Provinces there in conteyned, appeale. The &s;ame Par|lamens have their re&s;idence in the cities of Paris, Rouaan, Ren|nes, Bordeaux, Tholou&s;e, Grenoble, Aix, and Digion. In our time hath King Henry the Great of an immortal memory joy|ned his &s;ouveran Prinsdom of Bearn to the Krown, and there erected a ninth Parlament in the city of Pau.</P>
<P>ITALY, which many account for the fayre&s;t countrey in the World, &s;hold have obtayned its name from the King Italus of Sicily, who fir&s;t taught the Inhabitans husbandry. The Territories of Italy in the We&s;t are, &amp; partly al&s;o in the North, the Alpes with the flood Varo, which divide this Country from Frans, Germany and Swit&s;erland: forth thence forth the Sea wa&s;heth round about it. The hil Apenius is as the back|bone of Italy, dividing the &s;ame in length allmo&s;t over thwart from the hils of Alpes to the Sea of Sicily. Italy hath for the mo&s;t part a healthy and good temperate ayr, the ground is wonderful fat and fruitful, affording plenty off Korne, fruite, &amp; all &s;orts off hearbs, &s;everal excellent good Wines, Oyl &amp; Flax, the fields are ful off tame, and the woods ful off wild creatures, the hils adorned througly with &s;everal Metals and &s;tones. Here are found many waters repleni&s;hed with fi&s;h, many glorious and neatly-built and &s;trong cities, in one nord, this country is the right Paradijs off World. In Italy are 28 Ar&s;h-Bis&s;hops and more then 200 Bis&s;hops; with many beautiful cities, off which the&s;e are the chiefe&s;t: Rome, Napels, Florence, Ve|nice, Genua, Milanen, Bolonien, Ravenna, Cremona, Pavia, Paedoa, Verona, Vicenza, Mantoua, Siena, Luca, Ancona and Livorne are the two chiefe&s;t havens. Me&s;&s;ina and Palermo lye in Sicily. The Ilands of Sicily are &s;pecially three; Sicily, Cor|&s;ica and Sardinien; be&s;ides other little ones.</P>
<P>GERMANY, the greate&s;t Countrey off one name and Language in whole Europe, the Latini&s;ts call it Ger|mania, the inhabitans them&s;elves call it <HI>Teut&s;chlandt</HI> / the rea&s;on hereof is uncertaine. The linits off Garmany doe at this day &s;tretch much further then in the dayes off Prolomy, for in the We&s;t is pa&s;&s;eth through the Rhine, and beateth at the French Lands of Loreyn and Bourgondien; in the South, it &s;tretche&s;t over the River Donau to the hils the Alpes, which divide it from Italy; in the Ea&s;t it bordereth on Pru&s;&s;ia, Po|land, and Hungary, in the North on the North-zea, Den|marck, and the Ea&s;t-zea. 't Is a warlik Nation and a populous Countrey, no le&s;&s;e plea&s;ant then fruitful; it hath a &s;weet Plea|&s;ant ayr, and plenty of Wines, which produce delicate good Wines. The Woods and Fields are repleni&s;hed with wilde and tame Bea&s;ts, the Rivers and other Waters rich off Vi&s;ch: Here are found very faire Fountaines, and healthy baths; many of Iron, Steele, Kopper, Tinne, Gold and Silver. Germany is divided in the high and lowe Countreys. The high Coun|treys are called tho&s;e places which lye next to the Alpes, and conteyne tho&s;e following Provinces: El&s;az, Swaben, the County of the Pals on the Rhine, the Kingdome off Bohe|men, which, though the inhabitans thereof u&s;e another lan|guage, noth wich&s;tanding is comprehended within Germany and hath under it three Provinces; to wit, Marhern, Sile&s;ien and Lau&s;nits. The County Tirol, Stiermarck, Carnten, and Carniola or Crayn. The Low-Countreys comprehend the Bis&s;hopricks off Ments, Trier and Coln, the County off He&s;|&s;en, the Dukedoms off Saxen, Pomeren, Mekelenburgh, Mey&s;&s;en, Thuringen, Cleeff and Bergh, with the Countreys which doe depend on them. Under the Marque&s;&s;e off Bran|denburg re&s;ort We&s;tphalen &amp; the Dukedom of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;lant.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>THe LOW-COUNTREYS, which in time off the Romans mo&s;t were conteyned in <HI>Gallia-Belgica,</HI> are at this day divided in 17 Provinces, bordering in the We&s;t and South on Frances, in the Ea&s;t on the Rhine or the Maas, in the North on the Ocean. The ayre off the&s;e Countreys is thick and moi&s;t, but healthy and convenient; the ground for the mo&s;t part even and &s;mooth. The Low-Countres are very fruit|ful off Korne, and &s;everal &s;ortes off tre-fruyt; they afforde al&s;o much Flax, Hemp; there is al&s;o much catle to be found: but the chief of the countrey con&s;i&s;teth in fishing and navigation, whe|rein the inhabitants &s;urpa&s;&s;e all other Nations. The&s;e 17 Pro|vinces are partly &s;ubject under the Hou&s;e off Bourgundien, partly free, and are governed in the manner of a comonon|weath. The Hou&s;e of Bourgundien po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the Dukedoms off Brabant, Limburg, and Lutzenburg, and one Quartier off Gelderland, the Marquizdom off the Holy Empire on the Ri|ver Schelde, the Earldoms off Flandres, Artois, Henegou, Namen, and the Dominion off Mechelen. The free united Low-Countrey Provinces are the&s;e: three quarters of the Du|kedom Gelderland, and the Earldom Sutphen, the Earldoms off Holland and Zeland, and the great Dominions off Utrick, Frie&s;land, Overy&s;&s;el, and Groeningen.</P>
<P>HELVETIA or SWITSERLAND borders in the South, on Italy; in the Ea&s;t on the Earldom on Tirol; in the We&s;t, on Savoyen and Bourgondien; in the North, on Ei&s;az and Loreynen. It is a countrey which lieth in the mid&s;t off the Alpes, and therefore accounted the highe&s;t Countrey off Europe, indifferent good and fruytful; free and re&s;pected off all its neyghbours, divided in &s;everal Cantons, which the call Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">en. The chief cityes are Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Ba&s;el, Friburg, Baden.</P>
<P>The Earldom off Walles, where of Sitten is the prime city, &amp; the Province off the Gri&s;ons or Graubunders, having Chur for a capital City, have bin long &s;ince in con&s;ederacy with the Swit|&s;ers, and defend one another again&s;t theyr common enemies.</P>
<P>POLAND borders towards the Ea&s;t on Sile&s;ien; hath for her Neygbours the Pru&s;&s;iaus, Littauwers, and Hungarians; it is a very fruytful Countrey off all &s;orts off Korne. The chief city is Cracou, &s;ituated on the Weixel. Not farre from thence are mines off Salt. The chief commodities which are tran&s;por|ted out off Poland in other countreys, are, Wheat, Rie, Flax, Wax, Wood and Lead.</P>
<P>DENMARKE is an indifferent great and large King|dom, on a wonderful manner parted and divided throug the &s;ea. Its extreme&s;t Province is Jutland, in former time called Cimbrica Cher&s;onne&s;us. This countrey bordereth in the South an Germany, being forthwith environed with the &s;ea, for the mo&s;t part it is fruytful and rich off Korne, except in the North, where it is &s;andy and barren. Out of Denmark are conveighed to other parts multitude of Oxen and Hor&s;es, much Butter, Hides, Vi&s;ch, &amp;c. The chief city is Coppenhaven, where the King deepes his court, and where there is an Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>NORWAY hath on the Ea&s;t Sweveland, on the We&s;t the Ocean, on the South Denmarke, and on the North Lapland. The We&s;t and South Quarters of the Countrey are of an indifferent temperate Climate, but on the North the &s;oile is unfruytful, and not able to feed and &s;upports its habitans. Out of Norway cometh plenty of Stok-vi&s;ch, great quantity of pelt, hides, trane, tarre, ma&s;ts, &s;pars, plankes, &amp; other &s;ort of wood.</P>
<P>SWEDEN or SWETHELAND boundeth in the We&s;t on Norway, in the South on Denmarke; in the Ea&s;t on the white Sea and Mo&s;covia; in the North on the Ys-Sea. This Kingdom is one of the fruitful&s;t Quarters of the North, &amp; affordeth much Korne, Hony, Wax, Pelts, Hides, Roer, Silver, Steele, Lead, Iron and Kopper. The head or chief city of the Kingdom is Stokholm, where the King keeps his Court.</P>
<P>MOSCOVIA hath towards the North the Sea Petzor|ke, towards the Ea&s;t the Tartarians; towards the South the Turks; &amp; towards the We&s;t, the Littauwers, Lijflanders, and the Swethers. The chief city is Mo&s;cou, there the great Du|ke (whone the Subjects call the Emperour of Ru&s;&s;ia) keepeth his Court. The principall commodites which are from hence tran&s;ported unito other Countreys, are Flax, Hemp, Wax, Eland &amp; Oxen-hides, &s;everall precious pelts, traan &amp; &s;alt vi&s;ch.</P>
<P>LIFELAND bordereth in the Ea&s;t on white Ru&s;&s;enland of Mo&s;covia; in the South on Samogitien, which is a part of Litta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">; in the We&s;t and North on the Ea&s;t-Sea. The chie|fe&s;t city is Rigs, not farre from the mouth of the River Dwyna. Ith affordeth much hony, Wax, As&s;hes, Pick, Taar, and Pelts.</P>
<P>HUNGARY hath for her Neygbours on the Ea&s;t Moldavia; and Walachia; on the South Bo&s;nia and Croatia, towards the We&s;t Au&s;tria or O&s;tenreich, and towards the North, Poland. The ground is exceeding fruytful of Korn, Wine, and all &s;ort of Victuall, of kattel here is &s;uch great plenty as that the &s;heep and Oxen are &s;ent in abundance to Germany and Italy. Here al&s;o are found many Mines of Gold, Silver, Kopper, Iron and Steele.</P>
<P>SLAVONIEN is environed betwixt Hungary, Italy, the Gulf of Venice and Grece: containing Liburnia, Croa|tia, Bo&s;nia and Dalmatia. The Turke hath a great part thereof in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, another part the Emperour of Germany, the re&s;t being &s;ituated on the Zea, is under the dominion of the Ve|netians.</P>
<P>GREECE, in former time a Mother and Nur&s;e of all &s;ort of learning, but now a bond&s;laaf of the unbeleeving Ma|humeti&s;ts, and an habitation of the Turki&s;h Emperous, is en|vironed on the North with Bulgaria and Servia; and forth with on the We&s;t, South and Ea&s;t compa&s;&s;ed about with the Sea. The commodities which are brought out of Greece and con|veyghed to forreine places, are, gold, &s;ilver, kopper, kopperas, &s;evral dying &s;tuffe, wines, oyl, flus, Dama&s;ts, &amp; Turk&s;ch Grog|greins. Greece or Grieckland hath allmo&s;t innumerable Ilands, among which the grea&s;t and mo&s;t famous, is, Candia, in for|mer time called Creta, affording very precious and delicate Wines, Mo&s;cadel and Malve&s;ii, Curtens, Scarletdie, Sugar, Cri&s;tal, goat-skins, Oyl, Hony, Wax, and healing hearbs.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t Ilands of Europe, &s;ituated in the great Sea, are, Brittaine, Yreland and Y&s;land, Brittaine (which certaine yeares hence is happily reduced under one Kingdom) was here to fo|re divided in Engeland and Scotland.</P>
<P>ENGLAND which with Scotland maketh the greate&s;t Iland of Europe, bearing abundance of good wheat and other &s;ort of Korn, and beautified with many rivers wherein is plenty of fish, hath many commodious havens: al&s;o mines of Gold, Silver, Lead, Iron, and e&s;pecially much precious Tinne: There are &s;everal &s;ortes of creatures, (&s;erving for the &s;uppor|tance of Man) and chiefly a great multitude of fine Wol-bea|ring &s;heepe, which indeed is the right golden fleece of this Ro|yal Iland. The chief city of whole Engeland is the glorious city London, &s;ituated on the River Teems, with a bridge over it, which is accounted one of the fayre&s;t of Europe. From hence come &s;everal &s;orts of Wollen clothes, Saffron, Tinne, Lead, Wheat, Baarly, Beat, Dried herrings, and Sea-koles.</P>
<P>SCOTLAND compa&s;&s;ed round about with the Sea, except on the South where it boundeth on Engeland, is not &s;o fruytful, hath notwit&s;tanding all nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;up|portance of life. The chief city is Edenbourrough. Scotland affordeth many &s;ortes of cour&s;e Wollen clothes: Wool, Malt, Hides, Fish and Stone-Koles.</P>
<P>YERLAND is ful of lakes &amp; &s;tanding Pooles, hath good fat pa&s;torage, al&s;o abundance of tame and wilde Bea&s;ts. This Iland hath an healthy ayre, beareth no venomou&s;thing. The inhabitants are rude wilde People but through the con|ver&s;ation &amp; governement of the Engli&s;h begin to be more &amp; more tamed. On the fields grow much gras, where in goe ma|ny kie &amp; &s;heep, but are &s;omwhat le&s;&s;e then in other countreys.</P>
<P>YZLAND is in length about hondert dut&s;ch miles, for the mo&s;t part unbuylt and hilly, in the valleys is much katle and gras, there groweth no Korne or other trees then bark and Junipertrees. The inhabitans make bread of beaten fi&s;h, wont to drinke water, but mixe it now with Korne, which is brought to them from forreyne places. They live mo&s;t, in caves or holes under the earth, and account the Mountaines for theyr cities, make theyr hou&s;es of fi&s;h-bones. They in the Ea&s;t-countrey deale much for Y&s;land, and exchange ther com|modities for brim&s;tone, dry Fi&s;h, Roet, Butter, Skins of wilde and tame Bea&s;ts, white Faulkes, Hor&s;es, and other commodi|ties. In this Countrey are two Bis&s;hopricks, Holen and Schal|holt, which have &s;ome Nunneries under them. Here as al&s;o in other Northern parts are found many white Beares, which are exceeding fierce and cruel.</P>
<P>ASIA the &s;econd part of the olde World, is in the We&s;t divided from Europe throug the Rivers the Don and the Dwina; from Africk throug the narrownes, betweene the Me|diterranean and the red Seas; on the Ea&s;t it &s;tretcheth to the Chinee&s;ch or Eoi&s;ch, on the North to the Scyti&s;h, and on the South to the Indiaen Sea.

<PB REF="6"> plenty of &s;pices, precious &s;tones, ko&s;tly Pearles, and other rarities. This part of the world hath bin in all former times the mo&s;t famous; for from hence aro&s;e fir&s;t all dominions, where by the world hath bin governed. Man hath bin there fir&s;t crea|ted of God, placed in Paradijs, &s;educed throug Satan, and re|deemed throug Chri&s;t our Saviour.

<P>All the Countreys of A&s;ia are divided in &s;ix parts: where of the great Duke of Mu&s;covien doth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e a part; the &s;econd is under the Tyranny of the great Turk; the third under the Power of Tartarians; 4^t^h^. under the Dominion of the mighty King of China; the 5^t^h^. are the rich Countreys of Indien, and the 6^t^h^. and la&s;t part is under the command of the Sophi, or King Per&s;ien. To A&s;ia likewi&s;e appertaine an innumerable mul|titude of Ilands, among which the&s;e are the chiefe&s;t, Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, furthermore in the Indian Sea, Zeil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">n, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, Moluccen, Banda, Gilolo, Luconia and Japan.</P>
<P>Of Mu&s;covia wee have treated here to fore in the De&s;cription of Europe, &s;ith the mo&s;t part thereof is &s;ituated in Europe.</P>
<P>That which the great Turk doth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e in A&s;ia, are all the Provinces of Natolia (formerly called A&s;ia the le&s;&s;e) &s;mall Ar|menia, and a part of a great Armenia; Diarbech (in former time Me&s;opotamia) Syria and a great deal of Arabia. The chiefe&s;t Mart-townes in the&s;e Countreys are, Trape&s;onda, Aleppo, with the Sea-havens Tripoli, Amon, Dama&s;co, Baruti and Mecha. The&s;e Countrey affoard much &s;ilk, Ta&s;ti, Dama&s;ts, Turks Groggrein, Kotton and Scarletdie. The other part of Arabia re&s;orteth under &s;everall Kings, there in is &s;ituated the famous city Aden: from thence come very fayre Pearles; the unfeygned Balzem-Oyl, Franckincen&s;e, Myrrhe, and &s;uch|like commodities.</P>
<P>TARTARIE are in one name tearmed all the Coun|treys, &s;ituated, with a large and confu&s;ed comprehen&s;ion, Ea&s;tward from the Ea&s;tern Ocean, betwixt the Northern Yz-Sea and the Southern Countreys, as China, that part of In|dien without Ganges, the River Oxus, the Ca&s;pian and Meo|tian Sea to Mo&s;covien we&s;tward. The inhabitans are called Tartarians, who are ordinarily &s;trang; &s;tout and bold People, and who ea&s;ely &s;uffer hunger, heat, and cold. They have no cityes, villager nor hou&s;es, but dwel by companyes (which they call Hordas) with wives, childern and cattel (in tabernakels &amp; tents in the fields) now here, to morrow el&s;ewhere, where&s;oe|ver they finde good pa&s;torage for theyr cattle, to wit, Oxen, Sheep, Hor&s;es and Kamels, with who&s;e fle&s;h, blood and milk they &s;u&s;taine them&s;elves. Theyr Prince one or the greate&s;t Po|tentates of the Earth they call Cham (that is Duke) to whome they &s;hew &s;ingular obedience.</P>
<P>CHINA which is accounted the greate&s;t, powerful&s;t, &amp; riche&s;t Kingdome of the whole World, is compa&s;&s;ed on the Ea&s;t and South with the Orientall Ocean, which the An|cient named Mare Eoum; on the we&s;t with India and Bramas; and on the North it is joyned with Tartary, where the Kings have divided it with an admirable wall of 400 miles in length, buylt betwixt the hils. It is divided in 15 Kingsdoms or great Provinces, they have each a Prince or King of theyr owne, who againe &s;ubmit them&s;elves all unto one &s;upream King; who is able (according to the relation of the Portugals) in time of war|re to bring in the field moor as 300000 Footemen and 200000 Hor&s;emen. It is very fruytful of Korne, kattel, tame and wil|de: it hath al&s;o mines of precious &s;tones, gold, kopper, iron, &s;teel and pearls and &s;pecialy there is great abundance of &s;ilk: it conteyneth great migry citities, which al&s;o are very populous. Of the great and glorious city Paquin (where the King hath his re&s;idence) are almo&s;t incredible things written. The inha|bitans are very witty and &s;utle, inespecially in Manifactuurs, they make wagons with which they &s;ayle over Land, as with &s;hips in the Zea. The art of printing and making of pieces of ordonances hath bin by them farre &s;ooner in u&s;e as by us. They have good civil lawes, according to which they live; but the true knowlegde of God they want, &s;ith they are heathens, and adore Sun, Moone, and other idols, jea the Divel hun&s;elf, lea&s;t he doe them any evil. The principal commodities which come out of China, are, gold, precious &s;tones, musk, rhubarb, the root China, fine earthen platters, abundance of &s;ilke, &s;ugar, rijs, cotton, linnen and korne.</P>
<P>INDIEN &s;ituated betwixt Per&s;ien, the hil Tauri, China, &amp; the Indian Sea, is (as all writers Witnes) the be&s;t and nobe|le&s;t Countrey on Earth, or which produceth the beautiful&s;t &amp; be&s;t fruit, as wel tho&s;e which &s;erve for Mans &s;u&s;tenance a plea|&s;ure. It repleni&s;heth the whole World withis precious &s;tones and pearles, ko&s;tly &s;pices, medicinal drugs and perfumes, in &s;uch a manner that (if Paradys where no where to be had) this whole Countrey might betearmed a terre&s;trial Paradys. Many Kingdoms and rich countreys are therein conteyned, as the Kingdom of the great Mogol, which is properly Indien, Cam|baja, Orixa, Bengala, Aracan, Pegu, Malacca, Siam, Tipura, Gouro, &amp;c. Calicut, &s;ituated in Malabar, wont not long &s;ince to be the chief city of whole Indien, which at this time is called Coa: here have the Deputy of Portugal, the Arch-Bis&s;hop, the Kings Coun&s;el and the Chauncellors theyr re&s;idence, to commaund over all the Quarters of the Ea&s;tparts appertayning to the King of Spayne. Among many &s;trange thing and trees which grow in Indien, are the tree de Rais and the tree Tri&s;te very wonderfull. The tree de Rais or root-tree groweth fir&s;t from below as other trees doe, but &s;preading its branches, they grow ful of &s;prigs and roots, which bowing &amp; growing down|ward to the earth, at la&s;t grow fa&s;t there and take root, and in progres of time grow &s;o thick as the fir&s;t root, &s;o that they are hardly to be di&s;cerned one from anoter: out of which againe others round about grow to an innumerable number; &s;o that &s;uch trees in time &s;pread them&s;elves in a round circle an Italian mile farre; and not onely that the lowes branches thru&s;t theyr twigs &amp; rootes downwards (which afare of is as a deal of han|ging hemp) but al&s;o the uppermo&s;t highe&s;t, in &s;uch a manner that one onely tree maketh a clo&s;e wood.</P>
<P>De Arbore tri&s;te or the &s;adtree, &s;o called, becau&s;e he doth not &s;louri&s;h by day but alwayes by night; a &s;trange thing to behold. As long as the Sun is not &s;et, this tree appeareth as withered, and when the Sunne is &s;et, there is no blo&s;&s;om to be &s;een on it; but pre&s;ently an half houre after, it is as ful of blo&s;|&s;oms as may be, very faire to behold, and of an exceding plea|&s;ant &s;mel, and continueth &s;o the whole night: but as &s;oone as the day and Sunne returneth, doe all the blo&s;&s;oms fall of, that there remayneth not one on the tree, and cover the Earth, and the leaves &s;hut them&s;elfs half, &s;o that he &s;eemeth to be withe|red and dead; this continueth til evening, then it beginneth to get blo&s;&s;oms as before; and continueth &s;o the whole year.</P>
<P>PERSIA very famous in re&s;pect of the 2^d^e Monarchy, comprehendeth many Countreys and Provinces, is a very potent rich countrey, and is governed by the Sophi, who (though he be a Mahumeti&s;t) warreth continually again&s;t the Turck for the religion of Mahumet, and that in re&s;pect of the &s;everal expo&s;itions of the Alcoran. Out of Per&s;ia are brought precious &s;tones, Oriental Pearls, the cordial &s;tone Bezoar, much &s;ilk-work, and very fayr Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The nobele&s;t &amp; fayre&s;t Pearls which are found in the whole Ea&s;t, and which are called the right Oriental Pearls, are found in the Gulf of Per&s;ia, betwixt Ormus and Ba&s;&s;ora, in the Pla|ces of Bare in Caryffa, Julfar &amp; other places thereabout. The&s;e are fished by Divers, which are therein experienced, going ten, twelff, twenty and more fathoms under water, and growe in Oi&s;ters, which the Dippers (being naked) grable &s;wiffly on the bottom, and with a &s;mall baskef, which they have bound about theyr body bring them with them above water; being layd in the Sunne, they goe open of theyr owne accord, and therein are found the Pearls.</P>
<P>ZEYLAN is one of the be&s;t and fruytful&s;t Ilands which are knowne at this day, the Earth is there alwayes green, and the trees loadened with blo&s;&s;ems and fruit, producing the fayre&s;t Oreng appels, Lemmons, Citrons, and &s;uch like fruyt. The be&s;t Cinamon groweth here with hole bon&s;hes. This plea&s;ant fruit is the ondermo&s;t or &s;econd rind of tree, is cut of in foure &s;quare pieces, is of an a&s;ch-colour, being laid in the Sunne and rould up together, it becommeth red, and in three years after the trees have theyr rinde or bark again. Be&s;ides many other creatures there are multitude of Elephants, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;urpa&s;&s;e all Elephants of other Countroys in wit and nobilite.</P>
<P>We&s;tward from Zeylan are &s;ituated the Ilands Maldivia, more (as is reported) then eleven thou&s;and in number, which are mo&s;t inhabited, and &s;ome for theyr lownes not inhabited: here are not much other commodities then Coques, that is, Indian nuts, and the&s;e in &s;uch abundance, that the Inhabitants doe wholy maintaine them&s;elves with them, &amp; the leve almo&s;t whole Indien. The rind, or, that which &s;itteth about the fhel of this nut is the hemp of Indien, where of they make kabels &amp; all &s;ortes of ropes. They make theyr Ships of the wood of this tree, and &s;ewe them together with koardes made of this afore|named rind, without the u&s;e of an iron needle. The leaves of
<PB REF="6"> the tree they u&s;e for theyr &s;ayles. In one word, the &s;hip withal its appurtances, they victual and al&s;o merchandize where with it is loadened is all of this onely date tree, which maintayneth all the Inhabitants of the&s;e Ilands.</P>
<P>SUMATRA which in former times (according to the Opinion of many) was wont to be called Taprobana, is divided under &s;everall Kings: of all the&s;e is he of Achem the mo&s;t potent. Here groweth (be&s;ides &s;everall other &s;pices) plen|ty of very good Peper. Al&s;o there are mines of &s;everall mettals, whereof the Inhabitants make good peeces of Ordonnance. Here are found very big Elephants, which being tamed, are very fit for warre, they have theyr re&s;idence in the woods, by whole troupes: here is al&s;o to be &s;een the creature Rhinoceros, the arch-anemy of the Elephant, and thoug it be farr le&s;&s;e, yet notwith&s;tanding it dare enter battle with it: it doth whet its hornes again&s;t the rocks, and thereby endeavoureth to teare up the belly of the Elephant. Many judge it to be the right Unicorn. What &s;oever part of body this creature hath, but e&s;pecially the horne, is accounted very precious for the expel|ling of all venome.</P>
<P>JAVA is very fruitfull of &s;everall &s;pices and Indian fruyts, e&s;pecially here groweth great plenty of Pepper. Is divided among many Kings, of which the great Mataran, he of Bantam, and he of Tuban are the mightie&s;t. They who dwel on Sea|&s;hore are Mahumeti&s;ts, in the Countrey they are heathens. On Java the Hollanders have buyle the city and &s;trong fort Batavia where formerley Jacatra hath bin; it is the chiefe&s;t Colonie &amp; re&s;idence of the Governeur.</P>
<P>BANDA is a &s;mall Iland, but very famous; for here alone and on &s;ome Ilands thereabout grow all the nutmucks &amp; Mace, which are di&s;per&s;ed in great plenty over all the World. The trees on which the nutmeks grow are &s;omething alike the pear-tree of per&s;ick-tree, onely that they are &s;maller. The nut|meks are covered with a threefold &s;hel or rinde: the outmo&s;t is as the green rindes of acornes: when the&s;e are ripe, they divi|de or &s;eparate them&s;elves a&s;under, and then there is to be &s;eene a rind or ba&s;t, like a &s;mall net, where with the fruit is compa&s;|&s;ed about, fayre red of colour, like unto &s;carlet, plea&s;ant of &s;igt, which wee call Mace or the blom of the nutmek. When the fruit is ripe and groweth drye, the Mace breaketh forth, and becometh then an Orange couler. The third rinde or &s;hel is &s;ome what harder &amp; woodeni&s;h then the former; as the acor|ne-nuts, &s;afe that it is blacki&s;h, and that being opened, the|rein wee find the Nutmek. Three times in the jear the&s;e trees afforde ripe fruit, to wit in Augu&s;t, in December, and the be&s;t and mo&s;t in April. In Banda is to be &s;eene a wonderfull bird, which they call Eme, being almo&s;t once as big as a Swan, ha|ving black feathers, but no winges nor tong, above its head it hath a &s;harpnes or &s;hield, as a &s;hell-crab, he doth protect and defend him &s;elf with his &s;trong hookes, &s;triking behind him as a hor&s;e. He devoureth all that is ca&s;t before him, thoug it were apples as big as a fi&s;t, and that which is mo&s;t to be admired, bur|ning koles and great pieces of ice. In the year 1596 have the Hollands Ships brought &s;uch a bird a live at Am&s;terdam, for an admirable rarity.</P>
<P>The Ilands of Moluccen, &s;ituated under the Aequinoctial li|ne, and a little towards the North (thoug they be &s;mall) are notwith-&s;tanding famous over the whole world, in regard of cloves which growe onely in the&s;e places; and are vijf number, to wit, Ternate, Tidore, Motir, Machian and Bachian. The trees on which the cloves grow, are like the laurel-tree or bay|tree in bignes and fa&s;hion, onely that the leaves are &s;maller; like unto the almond or willow-leaves, they have many twigs and plenty of flowers, which fir&s;t are white, afterward green, and at the la&s;t red and &s;omewhat hard, and doe change in the|&s;e fruit, which wee call cloves. When the&s;e flowers are green they have the mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;mel above all flowers in the Worl|de. The flowers grow very clo&s;e together in great quantity on the utmo&s;t of the &s;prigs, as the berryes of the Myrtle-tree. The&s;e Ilands afford very little to the &s;u&s;tenance of man life; here groweth no rice nor korn; there are al&s;o no catle, but fewe bukgoat and hens. Theyr bread they make of &s;ome trees and roots. Onely in the&s;e Ilands are to be found the Paradijs-birde, which in &s;trange &amp; beautiful feathers &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all other birds in the World.</P>
<P>AFRICA, the third part of the old World, is divided from Europe through the Mediterranean, and from A&s;ia through the red Sea. The chief Countreys of Africa are Bar|Bary, Aegypt, Biledulgerid, Sarra, the Countrey of the Ethio|pians, the Abi&s;&s;ines, of Prie&s;t Johns Countreys, and Meno|motapa. The I&s;lands appertaining to Africa, are tho&s;e of Ca|naria, Cabo de Verde, S. Thomas Madaga&s;car, &amp; Sacotora. Out of Africa are brougt in Europe, Gold, Yvorie, Eben-wood, Aloe, the Aegyptian Balzem-olye, Mumia, Myrrh, Feathers, Sugar, Ginger, Daats and &s;ome Wines from Madera, and the Ilands of Canari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</P>
<P>BARBARY, the be&s;t part of Africa, hath on the South the mountaynes of Atlas; on the We&s;t, the Atlanti&s;h; &amp; on the North the Mediterranean Zea. It is divided into four Kingdomes, as Marocco, Fez, Tele&s;in and Tunes it is wate|red with many Rivers, which flowing out of the hils Atlas, Powreth out her waters in the Mediterranean Zea. The King|dom of Fez, which is farre forth the mightie&s;t of Barbary, hath its name derived from the Mother-city Fez, a fayr and popu|lous city partly environed with Walls and fortwith mountai|nes and rocks. It is reported that in the &s;ame are 700 chur|ches, where of the Mother-church comprehendeth a large round place, having 30 high and very &s;pacious dores. Here grow ordinarily many daats, Oranges, Olives, Figs, and &s;uch like fruyt, but not much wine. The Inhabitants are white or jollow Mores, commonly an upright and good, but dom and uncapable people.</P>
<P>EGYPT hath bin many years hence a famous Countrey, &s;o admirable fruytful, when the River Nile doth but keepe its ordinary cour&s;e, and flowe 13 cubites over the Land, that the Po&euml;t Lucan doth highly extol it. The afore&s;ayd flood be|ginneth commonly to encrea&s;e in the beginning of June, and continueth 40 dayes: then it doth by litle and litle decrea&s;e, &amp; as &s;oone as any part of the Countrey runneth drie, they begin to ca&s;t theyr zeed in the earth, not &s;tanding in need of rayne or any other humidty. The Aegyptians have bin in former times very futtel and witty, great A&s;tronomers and Phy&s;icians, but exceeding &s;uper&s;titious.</P>
<P>The Pyramides, which are reckoned among the &s;even mi|racles of the world, where formerly erected in this place by theyr Kings, eyther for vayn glory and o&s;tentation of theyr great power and wealth, or to keep the people in action that they might not betake them &s;elves to ydelnes.</P>
<P>ETHIOPIA or ABISSINEN hath northward Ly|bien and Egypt; towards the We&s;t the River Nigar, and the Kingdom of Congo; towards the South the Maensber|gen; and towards the ea&s;t the Kingdoms of Melinde, Maga|doxa and the red Sea, and though here grow but little korne, notwith&s;tanding it beareth much fruyt, unkowne to us, fir&s;t for maintenance of Mans life. The Inhabitans are Chri&s;tians have one King who by us is called Prie&s;t John, but by them Acegue &amp; Negus, that is Emperour and King: He writes that he is of the hou&s;e of David: is able to ray&s;e ten hondert thou|&s;end Men of warre, and 500 Elephants, be&s;ides a great num|ber of hor&s;es and Camels, they have one Patriarch, whome they call Abuma, who is the head of the Clergii: have Cloi|&s;ters for Men and Women, but the Monkes as al&s;o the Prie&s;t being married, mu&s;t maintaine them&s;elves with theyr own la|bour and husbandry. They mixe the go&s;pel and the old Te&s;ta|ment among one another: circumci&s;e both male and female kind, and baptize them with water and fire, to wit, in burning &s;ome tokens on theyr face; and the bapti&s;m of water is yearly revewed by them. They keep al&s;o lent; which continueth with them 50 dayes, with water and bread, and &s;ome of them with green hearbs. They have be&s;ides the&s;e many other cere|monies &amp; &s;uper&s;titions to tedious to relate.</P>
<P>BILEDULGERID beareth that name from the palm or Daat-tree, which groweth here in quantity. The Inha|bitants are dul &amp; bor&s;h, without any good lawes or manners.

<P>NEW-SPAYN conteyneth many Provinces and Na|tions of &s;everall languages. The chief city of this Coun|trey is Mexico, a Queen of all the cities of the new world. Be|fore the Spanjards came hither, the number of the hou&s;es were 70000, and was &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a great or large lake or &s;tandingh poole, almo&s;t as Venice: but Ferdinandus Cortez, who in the jears 1519 and 1520. hath brought the&s;e Coun|treys under the command of the King of Spayn, hath tran&s;por|ted the city on the &s;hore of the lake, and is at he pre&s;ent a wel|built city. The other principall cities next to Mexico, are, Com|po&s;tella, (where the Bis&s;hop hath his &s;tool, and the Kings Council her re&s;idence,) Colima or Purficatio, Guadalajara, Mechoacan, Sacatula, and Civitas Angelorum, or the city of Angels. The commodities which are tran&s;ported hence unto other parts of the World, are Gold, Silver, Pearls, Balzem-Oyl, Concenille or Scarlet-die, Sal&s;aparilla, the reat Mechoacanna, Brim&s;tone and Hides.</P>
<P>FLORIDA is plea&s;ant and indifferent fruitfull countrey. Here growe mulberries, cherries, che&s;nuts, grapes, medlers and prunes. Here are al&s;o ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, goates, beares, leopards, and many other creatures; al&s;o peakocks, partridges, parrets, and manifold birds, which are yet unknown to us. In the Rivers are many and &s;everal Serpents, and many Crocodils, which the inhabitants mo&s;t continually &s;eek to oppo&s;e. As for the man|ners of the inhabitants, they are for the mo&s;t part rude and not cha&s;t. They doe not let their Children learn na art nor trade, neither reprove them for their faults. From robbing and to keep that which they have tobbed as their owne, they make no con&s;cience. Every one nothwith&s;tanding hath his owne wife, and are very jealous, account no thing &s;o precious as the cu|rious colours of the feathers of birds. They doe beleeve the im|mortality of &s;oules, but are otherwi&s;e Idolaters.</P>
<P>PERU, the mo&s;t famaus place of all Countreys in the world, hath on the North Ca&s;tilia del Oro; on the ea&s;t the hils; on the South Chili; and on the We&s;t the great Southern Zea. The prime city is Lima, otherwi&s;e called Ciudad de los Reyes: there the Deputy hath his re&s;idence, al&s;o the Ar&s;ch-Bis&s;hop, having under him for Bis&s;hops-cities, Quito, Cu&s;co, Guamanga, Guanuco, Popoian, Gajaquil, Chacapoias, Porto Vejo, Arequipa, Plata, Trugillo, Charchi, S. Miguel &amp; S. Fran|ci&s;co. This Countrey is temperate of ayr, very populous, and fruitfull of precious &s;tones, bezoar-&s;tone, Sal&s;aparilla, and e&s;pe|cially of gold and &s;ilver: for it is accounted for one of the riche&s;t in the world in regard of this acceptable and de&s;irable Metall; which is al&s;o ea&s;ily to be conceived from the great trea&s;ures which have bin many jears hence, and yet are, conveyged thence. That which the Hi&s;torians write of Peru is almo&s;t in|credible. Atabaliba, King of Peru, when the Spanjaerts came fir&s;t thither, &amp; tooke him pri&s;oner, offered for his redemption, to fil up the place, where he lay impri&s;oned, with gold, &s;o high as he &s;tanding on his toes, where able to reach with his fin|gers; the place was 22 feet in length, and 17 in breadth; or if they rather wold have Silver, he wold fil the place twice up to the top of the hou&s;e. It appeareth al&s;o out of hi&s;tories, that the Spanjards in their fir&s;t coming thither did cover the hoofs of their hor&s;e with Gold and Silver, from Peru are tran&s;ported in to Europe Gold, Silver, Precious &s;tones, Be&s;oar-&s;tone, Sal&s;apa|rilla, and more other things of an healingh nature.</P>
<P>CHILI is al&s;o larg Countrey, rich of Gold, but as yet litle knowne, much le&s;&s;e conquered by the Spanjards, again&s;t which nation the inhabitans (for the defence of their liberty) continually warre, wherein al&s;o they carre them&s;elves manly.</P>
<P>BRASIL is towards the ea&s;t and north compa&s;&s;ed about with the Sea: towards the we&s;t &amp; north it hath the large River of the Ama&s;ones, and to the South de Rio de la Plate. This is a very plea&s;ant and fruitful Countrey, and of an healthy ayre. This Province is divided by the Portugals into 9 gou|vernments, which they call Capitanias, other doe reck on 14, to wit, S. Vincent, R. de Jenero, Porto Seguro, Spirito Santo, Itheos, Bahia, Seregipe, Phernambuco, Tamaraca, Parayba, Rio Grande, Ciara, Maranhahon, and Para; though &s;ome of the&s;e &s;urpa&s;&s;e the bounds of Bra&s;il. The inhabitants are called Margajaten, Trabajaten, Ovetacaten, Tovoupinambaultien, Morpions, and many more: mo&s;t all of them cruel and wild people, and eaters of mankind. They goe &s;tark naked, Men and Women: Adorne them&s;elves with feathers, they bore in their lips and cheeks great holes, in which they place certaine little &s;tones or bones, which is of a terrible &s;ight. They are &s;tran|gers to all civil governement and religion, they known neither honour heavenly nor earthly Gods: beleeve notwith&s;tanding the immortality of the Soules, and that tho&s;e who have taken pri&s;oners, killed eaten many Enemies, live with their Fore-fa|thers in delight &amp; dancing: and on the contrary that the &s;low are carried away and tormented of the Aignan, that is, the di|vel, who doth plange them. They warre alwayes one again&s;t another, the one Nation again&s;t the other: their weapons are wooden &s;pears or Javelins, bowes, and arrows. Their enemies whome on both &s;ides they take pri&s;oners, they make fat as &s;wine, and afterward kil them with many ceremonies, and being roa&s;ted on their woodden grid-irons, eath them up. The Margajaten are friends to the Portugals, through who&s;e con|ver&s;ation they by degrees are tamed, and made &s;ubject to lawes and civil gouvernement be&s;ides Bra&s;ily-wood, cotton &amp; other things more, doth Bra&s;il afford, more as other Countreys, great quantity of &s;ugar, which groweth in long reedes or canes, the&s;e they breake, and grinde them with mils, afterward &s;eeth or boyle them in ketles, and &s;o they draw the plea&s;ant &s;weetnes out of it.</P>
<P>The principal Ilands of the new world are Hi&s;paniola, Cu|ba, Jamaico and S. Juan de Porto Rico. Hi&s;paniola is al&s;o cal|led S. Domingo, after S. Dominicus, to who&s;e honour they have built there a city, which is the head-city of all the re&s;t; there the Deputy of the King and the Bis&s;hop have their re&s;i|dence. It is al hilly, but above all other a plea&s;ant and fruitfull Countrey. Here growet great plenty of &s;ugar, Ca&s;&s;ia Fi&s;tula, Ma&s;tix, and great &s;tore of the be&s;t ginger. Here are al&s;o good mines of Gold and Silver, and from thence are brought abun|dance of Hides.</P>
<P>CUBA is a long &s;mall Iland, and al&s;o Mountainous, hath many gold-bearing rivers. The Spanjards have built there two cities, S. Jago, where the Bis&s;hop dwelleth, and Havana, the Matt-touwn and haven of the Iland, very &s;trong, where the fleet zayling from the We&s;tindis to Spain doth ordinarily meet, and wayte for winde and weather for to zayle over.</P>
<P>Some wont to cal for a fifth part of the world Terra Au&s;tra|lis or Magellanica, the Countreys in the South of the Streat Magellanes; but &s;ith the &s;hipping by the Hollanders to tho&s;e parts, but &s;ome few jears hence it known, that Tierra del Fue|go, by Magellanes called, is nothing than a heap of Ilands; and no firm land there about, which may beare the name of the 5^t^h^. part of the world, I thinke it &s;ufficient that I have touched it with the&s;e few words, except, two will call Terra Au&s;tralis, tho&s;e Countreys in the South of Nova Guinea, whether the Hollanders mo&s;t zayled in the jear 1644. and in the&s;e our Maps are called Hollandia Nova, and Nova Zelandia. Noth|with&s;tanding &s;ith the Coa&s;ts are but partly di&s;covered, and that we have no knowledge of the inwards Countreys, wee &s;hall as yet let them re&s;t under A&s;ia, til further di&s;covery; and com|mend &s;uch a divi&s;ion to our Po&s;terity, if wee by our life gaine no more knowledge.</P>
