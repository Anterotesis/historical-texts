<L>THere was a Maid as I heard tell</L>
<L>which fell in de&s;peration,</L>
<L>She lov'd a Young-man pa&s;&s;ing well,</L>
<L>which brought her in vexation:</L>
<L>The Young-man had the Maid beguil'd,</L>
<L>the matter &s;o was carried,</L>
<L>For he had gotten her with Child</L>
<L>before that they were married</L>
<L><HI>Which caus'd this Maid to make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and often times to &s;peak &s;o,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My belly is up and my heart is down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and my Love is gone to Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He was my joy and hearts delight,</L>
<L>and well my mind contented,</L>
<L>But now h&eacute;e's gone out of my &s;ight,</L>
<L>I &s;orely am tormented:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t he with me was living here,</L>
<L>heaven knows I lov'd him dearely,</L>
<L>But now my heart will bur&s;t with care,</L>
<L>it touch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th me &s;o nearly.</L>
<L><HI>I &s;igh I &s;ob&punc; and I make great moan,</HI></L>

<L>My Love was wondrous kind and fr&eacute;e,</L>
<L>when as fir&s;t he came a woing,</L>
<L>And many good guifts he gave to me,</L>
<L>becau&s;e he would be doing:</L>
<L>My Love gave me a Beaver Hat,</L>
<L>methought it was br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ve and bonuy,</L>
<L>And a gallant Love-fancy to weare in it,</L>
<L>which co&s;t five pound in mony:</L>
<L><HI>but now I weep and make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the rea&s;on why I &s;peak &s;o, &amp;c,</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Love gave me a Silken Gown,</L>
<L>with rich and co&s;tly Laces,</L>
<L>Ther's not a br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ver in the Town,</L>
<L>it all the re&s;t &s;urpa&s;&s;es:</L>
<L>My Love gave me a gay gold Ring,</L>
<L>and Bracelets made of Amber,</L>
<L>He al&s;o gave me a better thing,</L>
<L>when he had me in his Chamber.</L>
<L><HI>I &s;igh, I &s;ob, and I make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the rea&s;on why I &s;peak &s;o,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My belly is up and my heart is down,</HI></L>

<L>MY love gave me a Holand &s;mock</L>
<L>and bid me for to weare it</L>
<L>One night 'twixt ten &amp; eleven a clock</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure he did not teare it:</L>
<L>My Love gave me a Feather bed,</L>
<L>to lye on when I was weary</L>
<L>On which he had my Maiden-head</L>
<L>when he had made me merry</L>
<L><HI>but &s;ince dame fortune &s;he doth frown</HI></L>
<L><HI>this makes me &s;igh and &s;peake &s;o,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My belly is up and my heart is down</HI></L>
<L><HI>and my Love is gon to Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;ince that time I am po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>with many griefs I tell y&eacute;e</L>
<L>In head, in &s;ide in back and brea&s;t,</L>
<L>but chiefly in my belly:</L>
<L>Oh that my love were here againe,</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure he would befriend me,</L>
<L>And u&s;e a meanes to cure my pain,</L>
<L>and take a cour&s;e to mend me.</L>
<L><HI>I &s;igh, I &s;ob, and I make great moan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the rea&s;on why I doe &s;o, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If I had <HI>Icarus</HI> wings to flye,</L>
<L>I doe &s;o greatly mind him,</L>
<L>Then I would &s;oone beyond the Seas,</L>
<L>and &s;&eacute;eke till I could finde him,</L>
<L>If that he were in France or Spain.</L>
<L>or el&s; in High Spaniclo.</L>
<L>I'de &s;urely m&eacute;et with him again,</L>
<L>&s;o clo&s;ely would I follow.</L>
<L><HI>The Indies and the Wilderne&s;&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and hollow caves Ide &s;eek to.</HI></L>
<L><HI>And every place both more and le&s;&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nging to Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus many a woful day and night</L>
<L>the Dam&s;el lay lamenting,</L>
<L>Before her love appear'd in &s;ight</L>
<L>to y&eacute;eld her hearts contenting:</L>
<L>But mark what hapned at the la&s;t</L>
<L>when &s;he &s;o long had mourned,</L>
<L>The bonny Lad that &s;he lov'd be&s;t,</L>
<L>&s;afely from Sea returned.</L>
<L><HI>But when &s;he heard her true-love &s;peak</HI></L>
<L><HI>&s;he knew him by his tongue Sir,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her heart did in her belly leap,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and about his neck &s;he flung Sir.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good Lord what ki&s;&s;ing there was then;</L>
<L>with friendly kind embraces,</L>
<L>Vntill the joyfull tears of them</L>
<L>ran down each others faces:</L>
<L>The very night when this was done</L>
<L>as is for certain &s;poken,</L>
<L>She was delivered of a Son,</L>
<L>a fair and goodly token,</L>
<L><HI>Whereby &s;he alters &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">on her tune,</HI></L>
<L><HI>her fancy made her &s;peak &s;o,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My heart is up and my belly is down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>and my Love is come from Jamaica.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon after that the Seaman bold,</L>
<L>he having of mony plenty,</L>
<L>Ca&s;t in her lap ten pound in gold.</L>
<L>and halfe crown pieces twenty:</L>
<L>And &s;ince that time they married are,</L>
<L>whereby their joyes are double,</L>
<L>And now &s;he &s;ings with a merry ch&eacute;er,</L>
<L>being fr&eacute;e from care and trouble.</L>
<L><HI>My &s;orrows all are pa&s;t and gone,</HI></L>
<L><HI>which makes me &s;ing and &s;peak &s;o,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My hart is up and my belly is down,</HI></L>
