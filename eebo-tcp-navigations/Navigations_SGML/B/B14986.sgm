<P>_IT is certified from <HI>Palermo</HI> in Sicilia, that <HI>Don Franci&s;co di Ca&s;tro,</HI> as future Vize-Roy, is gone with his Gallies to Gaeta, to be admitted ther|in, and that the &s;aid Country hath determined to disbur&s;e 12000. crownes, to be imployed for the enter|taining of him as a welcome thither: but he would not per|mit them to doe it, neither would receiue the Pre&s;ents that they of Palermo pre&s;ented vnto him, nor once &s;uffer the common people to be burthened with any expences.</P>
<P>The Vize-Roy of Naples, by rea&s;on of the vprore made there becau&s;e of the great dearth, is yet in the Ca&s;tle of Saint Ermo, and hath come to a parly with the people, and in the meane time hath &s;ent a Po&s;t into Spaine, to certifie the King of the want of Corne, and the di&s;order touching the monies, and hath further taken order, that euery Citi|zen &s;hall haue fiue loaues of bread dealt out to them euery day, and euery &s;tranger but one loafe a day.</P>
<P>The Popes hath &s;ent out Commi&s;&s;ion, that all the &s;piri|tuall per&s;ons that had promi&s;ed to giue the tenth peny of their reuenewes vnto Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth, for the &s;eruice of the Catholike league in Germany, &s;hould pre&s;ently di&s;|bur&s;e and pay the one halfe thereof.</P>
<P>From Turnio it is written, that the Duke of Sauoy hath giuen his Hor&s;emen two moneths pay, and cau&s;eth the Ga|ri&s;on in A&s;ti to be renforced on Saterday in Saint <HI>Anthonio.</HI> The new Gally called <HI>Torre di Mar,</HI> was lanched, to be rig|ged and armed, and &s;o to be &s;ent vnto the Armado, and <HI>Andre Ferlerichi</HI> Captaine of the V&s;tochen, was &s;eene in the gulfe of Dalmatia, where he tooke one of <HI>Niclaoes Gardine|gees</HI> Barkes, and cut off the head of <HI>Stephano Roccouichi</HI> the
<PB N="2" REF="2">Captaine, which he &s;et vpon the Bandite Stoane, but his Souldiers &s;aued them&s;elues.</P>
<P>A Po&s;t out of France brings newes, that the King will haue Valtolino re&s;tored againe, and that to the &s;ame end, he prepareth 80000. foot and 10000. hor&s;emen, to inuade the Hugonites, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Le&s;digincres</HI> with his men are ready to march.</P>
<P>The newes is, that vpon the 17. day old and 27. new &s;tile of Ianuary, in the morning about 8. of the clock, the noble Prince <HI>Eru&s;t</HI> a Prince of the Empire, Earle of Hol&s;tein, Schaumburg, and Sterburg, Barron of Ge&s;hmen, &amp;c. to the great griefe and &s;orrow of his wife, Statholder, Chan|celour, and Coun&s;ell, as al&s;o of his faithfull Subiects, and adherents, departed out of this world: and although that by meanes of his death, his &s;aid Wife, Country, and Sub|iects, were much grieued, and &s;orrowfull, yet they were pre&s;ently comforted againe, becau&s;e that vpon the 7. day old &s;tile and the 17. new &s;tile of February, by Gods proui|dence, the Lord <HI>Iob&s;t Herman,</HI> Earle of Hol&s;tein, Shaum|burg, and Sternberg, Barron of Gehmen and Berghen, &amp;c. was receiued by the Coun&s;ell and States of the Countrey, for their Lord and right heire of the land. This happy ele|ction being made, the body of the afore&s;aid Prince <HI>Eru&s;t</HI> which &s;umptuou&s;ly &amp; &s;olemnly buried, vpon Thur&s;day be|ing the 21. old &s;tile and the 31 of March new &s;tile, God &s;end him a happy re&s;urrection, and peace and plenty vnto his Subiects.</P>
<P>Vpon Friday the 4. of March, the Lord <HI>Iohn Bapti&s;ta We|ber,</HI> one of the Emperours Coun&s;ell, rode vnto Hungarian Berg&s;tar, to receiue the &s;aid Towne for the Emperours v&s;e, and to appoint Officers therein.</P>
<P><HI>Bethlem</HI> hath &s;ent all the men of Bergh from thence into Siebenbergen, there to build his hill worke: Since that
<PB N="3" REF="2"><HI>Bethlem</HI> lay at Ca&s;chau, to whom there came a Turki&s;h Am|ba&s;&s;adour, and it is agreed that the Crowne of Hungaria, and the regall En&s;ignes, &s;hall be deliuered vnto the Empe|rours Amba&s;&s;adors, to the which end he hath cau&s;ed them to be brought from Et&s;chet to Ca&s;chau.</P>
<P>It is quiet and peaceable at Vianna, but there &s;hall be more forces &s;ent again&s;t the Earle of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and at Lintz there are 2000. hor&s;emen, and at Steyer 1000. &s;oot men mu&s;tered, which &s;hall all goe to <HI>El&s;as.</HI></P>
<P>The Saxon Regiment lie &s;till in Presburg, and for that the Burgers therein are much oppre&s;&s;ed, they haue &s;ent an humble Petition vnto the Emperour, to de&s;ire the &s;ending away of the &s;aid Regiment, what will be done therein, wee &s;hall heereafter know. It is reported that the Hungarian lands day, &s;hall be holden in Edenburg.</P>
<P>From Prague there is no &s;peciall newes to be written, but that dearth and want of all things daily encrea&s;eth, which is mo&s;t pittifull to thinke on. The Souldiers and poore people haue great want, and can hardly liue. There is no order taken, and it is feared that it will rather encrea&s;e then dimini&s;h. Touching the &s;ending away of the Emperours and &s;trange Souldiers out of Morauia: there is &s;ome &s;peech made, &s;ometimes it is agreed vpon, and then againe it is put off. The &s;trange Souldiers doe great hurt vnto the In|habitants of the Country, and although many complaints are made, yet no remedy is had, nor no puni&s;hment infli|cted vpon them. The poore Pe&s;ants in great numbers, for want of victuals, die euery day. The Subiects and Pe&s;ants goe alway to &s;owe and till the land, and in the meane time they are robbed of all they haue. The labouring men and &s;eruants are gone, and die for want of worke and maintai|nance, there is no ground plowed nor &s;owed, and therefore there is no hope of bettering, but rather a great dearth to
<PB N="4" REF="3">en&s;ue. The Duke of Lerchten&s;ten is expected to come to Pragne within eight dayes, who&s;e comming they hope will be a meanes of great reformation: God graunt it.</P>
<P>It is written from Heydlebergh, that eight dayes pa&s;t, being the fifth of March, the Bauarian &s;ouldiers, &s;et vpon Nu&s;eloch, Waldorof, and Laimen Villages lying about Heydleburgh, and tooke them: whereupon &s;ome of the &s;ol|diers in Heidlebergh in the night i&s;&s;ued forth, to &s;et vpon the Bauarians in Laimen, and finding that the Bauarians were gone from thence again, about &s;ome other enterpri&s;e, they entered into the &s;ame, and driuing out all the Cartle they found therein, put a Gari&s;on into the Village, and &s;o kept it from being &s;uddainly &s;urpri&s;ed againe by the Ene|mie: there were al&s;o a good number of Bauarian &s;oldiers &s;eene about Dil&s;perg Minnenburg.</P>
<P>Out of Spiers it is written, that Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> had taken two Villages in the Palatinate, and hardly be&s;et Wi&s;eloch, but could not preuaile again&s;t it: but when <HI>Mansfield</HI> drew neere to Manheim bridge, <HI>Tilly</HI> being not &s;trong enough in the field, he retired againe, whereby the affaires remaine in <HI>antiquis terminis,</HI> &s;o that no man can write any certainty thereof. Colonell <HI>Ouertrant</HI> is at Germer&s;heim with his forces.</P>
<P>To Lindenburg there are many Saylers, Carpenters, and Bridge Ma&s;ters, come from Stein, to &s;et the &s;hip bridge ouer the Necker. There &s;hall be no bridge ouer the Rhine at Stein, but at Oppenheim. The Earle of <HI>Mansfield</HI> is daily expected at Manheim, who&s;e intent is, with halfe his Ar|my, to march the Bergh&s;trate, and with the other halfe to goe to Oppenheim.</P>
<P>From France it is confirmed, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Force,</HI> hath ouerthrowne <HI>Mon&s;ieur S^t. Lurks</HI> Regiment, and that &s;ome places in Languedor are be&s;ieged and taken by the
<PB N="5" REF="3">Barron <HI>de Sonbi&s;e:</HI> &s;ince that the Hugonites haue take the Towne of Neracagaine, driuen the Gari&s;on out of it, and killed many of them. They of Rochell haue cut off the pa&s;|&s;age of &s;ending any thing to <HI>Burdeaux</HI> by water, &amp; are gone with their Army by &s;ea el&s;e where; yet in Paris they &s;peake of a peace.</P>
<P>Colonell <HI>Pithan</HI> hauing ouer night &s;upt with the Prince of Orange, by commaundement of the Coun&s;ell of State, was the &s;ame night arre&s;ted by the Mar&s;hall of the Court being in his lodging, and it is &s;aid that hee is put into the place where <HI>Barnfeld</HI> was committed pri&s;oner, and it ap|peareth, that others al&s;o will be brought thether, for all the Captaines that were in Gulick, are &s;ent for the ther.</P>
<P>There are two Souldiers of Hen&s;den, and three hor&s;e|men of Gertrudenbergh, that are &s;u&s;pected to be acquain|ted with the Trea&s;on that is di&s;couered, and are brought pri&s;oners to the Hage, who haue beene rackt to make them to confe&s;&s;e their fault.</P>
<P>There is preparation made here for an Army by land.</P>
<P>There came a Letter from Midleburgh in Zealand to Am&s;terdam, that they of Sluce in Flaunders haue cut cer|taine &s;luces of water, and thereby haue not onely enclo&s;ed all the Spani&s;h Sconces, but al&s;o the Towne of Bruges and Gant round aboutwith water, whereby many thou&s;and A|kers of land are drowned, and great hurt is done in the land. And that there are Armes for 15000. men &s;ent to Breame for <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Duke of Brun&s;wick: and &s;ince that, that there are as many more bought for 6000. men.</P>
<P>The Lords, the States Proclamation was proclaimed in Am&s;terdam, whereby they prohibit all Ie&s;uites and other Prie&s;ts, as well Strangers as naturall borne Subiects, within &s;ixe dayes after the publication thereof, not to come into, nor &s;tay within the vnited Prouinces, but for &s;uch naturall
<PB N="6" REF="4">Prie&s;ts as dwell there: they are permitted to &s;tay therein, certifying their names and lodgings vnto the Magi&s;trates of the places where they are re&s;ident.</P>
<P>From Cullen it is written, that after the taking of the Towne of Gei&s;eck, the chiefe Lieutenant Colonell <HI>Erwitte</HI> went backe againe with certaine thou&s;and Hor&s;emen to <HI>Paterborne,</HI> and tooke the Townes of Peckel&s;heim, Bergen|rich, Bercholt, and Warburg, vpon the 10. of March, and of them of Carpegan newly taken, &s;uddainly &s;urprized and killed 1000. hor&s;e and foot men, and tooke &s;ome of the Of|ficers pri&s;oners.</P>
