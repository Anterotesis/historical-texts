<P>Whereas the Freedom and Liberty of the Wor&s;hip of God, according to the holy Scriptures, is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;irable thing, and in the next place the Security of the Liberty, and property of the per&s;ons and E&s;tates of every man to him and his po&s;terity &s;o far as humane prudence can extend it &s;elf for the common good of mankind ought to be pre&s;erved; Wee therefore doe re&s;olve and agree by Gods permi&s;&s;ion to &s;etle a free Port and Trade for all Nations in an Eminent part of <HI>We&s;t-India,</HI> whereunto we are invited by a great and populous Em|pire, where we &s;hall not only by the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance be capable of promoting the true Wor&s;hip of God, but al&s;o of enriching our &s;elves, and all that &s;hall be concerned with us, and therefore We propo&s;e to our own and all other Chri&s;tian Na|tions, who are de&s;irous to joyn in &s;o glorious and great an un|dertaking to incorporate with us; re&s;olving to give and allow equal Priviledges and Advantages to all, according to their Merits. And becau&s;e &s;o great an undertaking cannot be ef|fectually carried on without the concurrence of many per&s;ons of ability and Sub&s;tance, We do re&s;olve and agree that when we have received the Sub&s;criptions of Seventy per&s;ons to this undertaking, a general meeting &s;hall be appointed and held, where the whole Affair &s;hall then be debated, and &s;uch Officers, both Military and Civil as may &s;eem convenient, &s;hall be &s;etled with the methods for effecting this great glorious and advanta|geous Affair, which we que&s;tion not but God that hath in&s;pired us in the undertaking, will ble&s;s and pro&s;per to the accom|pli&s;hing thereof; but in regard all things are intended to be managed by a Comon Stock, and the Advantages de&s;tributed according to the Quantum of every per&s;ons &s;ub&s;cription, which cannot be brought to the de&s;ired perfection, without &s;ome pre&s;ent Charge. It is therefore agreed that every Sub|criber &s;hall depo&s;ite the &s;um of twenty Gilders upon his Sub|&s;cription, to be imployed for and towards the nece&s;&s;ary charge of the promoting and obtaining the Sub&s;criptions, and meeting of the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly of Seventy, to whom affair and ju&s;t Ac|count shall be given at their meeting, and then the Remain|der of that Money and all &s;uch Sums as &s;hall then and after be
