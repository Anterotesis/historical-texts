<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> there are very &s;ure of the Friendline&s;s of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> and the five other Nations above them.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 24. The <HI>Mohawk Sachems,</HI> appeared in the Court-Hou&s;e of <HI>Albany,</HI> with a Pre&s;ent of Beaver of about twenty pound value, who cho&s;e their Speaker, he ta|king two or three Skins, the re&s;t &s;itting &s;ilent, Ro&s;e up and &s;aid:</P>
<P N="1">1. Brethren, we are now come as our Grandfathers u&s;ed to do, to Renew our Unity, Friend&s;hip and Covenant made by us and you.</P>
<P N="2">2 We de&s;ire the Hou&s;e, being the Covenant and Propo&s;ition Hou&s;e may be kept clean, that we may keep a clean, &s;ingle, and not a double heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. We do now Renew the Former Covenant or Claim that hath been made be|tween us and you; <HI>(viz.) New-England, Virginia, Mary-land,</HI> and tho&s;e parts of <HI>America,</HI> that it may be kept bright on every &s;ide, and not &s;uffered to ru&s;t, or be forgotten.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are heartily &s;orry to hear of the Blood&s;hed by tho&s;e ill minded <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;tward;</HI> and we now Pre&s;ent this Guift as our <HI>Indian</HI> manner is, to wipe the Tears from the Eyes, and the Blood from off the Relations of tho&s;e who have lo&s;t Friends by tho&s;e ill-minded men.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let the Tree of Love, Unity and Commerce grow and flouri&s;h, and let the Roots &s;pread and branch forth through all our &s;everal Dominions, to &s;tand fa&s;t that none may move it; &s;o that we may live under the &s;hade of the Tree, &s;o that the Sun of Di&s;cord and Quarrelling may not &s;corch and wound us.</P>
<P N="6">6. We have heard there hath been &s;everal Emba&s;&s;yes the la&s;t year from you to <HI>Canady.</HI> that we could not be acquainted with, we do all publickly Above-board, and we de&s;ire you do &s;o al&s;o.</P>
<P>We heard that the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians</HI> came where &s;ome of our men were Hunting, de&s;irous to &s;peak with us, but we refu&s;ed to have any di&s;cour&s;e with them, but warned them to be gone, &s;o that they came not near our Forts, but went as they came.</P>
<P N="7">7. We intend a Meeting of the Chief of our five Nations in a little time, at <HI>A|madado,</HI> there further to con&s;ider of publick Affairs, and de&s;ire that you would &s;end &s;ome per&s;ons from you to hear what we &s;hall Confer of, and al&s;o &s;ome of the <HI>River Indians</HI> if they &s;ee cau&s;e, the Meeting was chiefly intended to con&s;ider what An&s;wer to give the <HI>French,</HI> who had often &s;ent to have Speech with them.</P>
<P>VVhen the <HI>Sachems</HI> had heard how Matters were circum&s;tanced, in the Coun|try, and what News was come to hand, &s;eemed to be glad, and much Rejoiced, &amp; wholly laid a&s;ide their intended Meeting, promi&s;ing neither to &s;peak with them, nor to allow the <HI>French</HI> to &s;peak to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Albany</HI> &s;ay, the <HI>Mohawks</HI> &s;hew them&s;elves very willing to go again&s;t the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians,</HI> if De&s;ired.</P>
