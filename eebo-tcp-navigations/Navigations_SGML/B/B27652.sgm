<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 2. 1692.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE your Lord&s;hip &s;eems to think, that an Account in general of the Fleet's good Succe&s;s, is not &s;o &s;atisfactory as one &s;etting forth the Particulars, I here &s;end it with as much Brevity as the Matter will ad|mit of. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was not much inclined to trouble you in this nature, not being ambitious to &s;ee my Name in Print on any Occa|&s;ion; but &s;ince 'tis your Lord&s;hips Commands, I am the more enclined to give you the be&s;t Information I am able of the Action, having &s;een &s;everal Printed Relations not very &s;incere.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> in the Evening, being the Eighteenth of <HI>May,</HI> &s;tanding over for <HI>Cape de Hague,</HI> I ordered Captain <HI>Gillam</HI> in the <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Charles</HI> Galley, to lie at &s;uch a di&s;tance to the We&s;tward of the Fleet, that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> might di&s;cover any Signals made from me.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y">
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the Nineteenth, &s;tanding with a &s;mall Gale S. S. W. the Wind at W. and W. and by <HI>S.</HI> hazey Weather, <HI>Cape Barfleur</HI> bearing then S. W. and by S. from me di&s;tant about Seven Leagues, between three and Four in the mor|ning, we heard &s;everal Guns to the We&s;tward, and in a &s;hort time I &s;aw the two Frigats making the Signal of &s;eeing the Enemy, with their Heads lying to the Northward, which gave me rea&s;on to think the Enemy lay with their Heads that way; upon which I ordered the Signal to be made for the Fleet's drawing into a Line of Battel; after which I made the Signal for the Rear of the Fleet to Tack, that if the Enemy &s;tood to the Northward, we might the &s;ooner come to engage; But &s;oon after four a Clock, the Sun had a little cleared the Weather, and I &s;aw the French Fleet &s;tanding to the Southward, forming their Line on the &s;ame Tack that I was upon; I then ordered that Signal for the Rear to Tack to be taken in, and at the &s;ame time bore away with my own Ship fo far to Leeward, as I judged each Ship in the Fleet might fetch my Wake or Graine; then brought to again, lying by with my Fore-top-&s;ail to the Ma&s;t, to give the Ships in the Fleet the better opportunity of placing them&s;elves, as they had been before directed. By eight a Clock we had formed an indifferent Line, &s;tretching from the S. S. W. to the N. N E. the Dutch in the Van, the Red in the Center, and the Blue in the Rear. By Nine a Clock the Enemies Van Guard had &s;tretch'd almo&s;t as far to the Southward as ours, their Admiral and Rear-Admiral of the Blue that were in the Rear, clo&s;ing the Line, and their Vice-Admiral of the &s;ame Divi&s;ion &s;tretching to the Rear of our Fleet, but ne|ver coming within Gun-&s;hot of them. About ten they bore down upon us, I &s;till lying with my Fore-top-&s;ail to the Ma&s;t. I then ob&s;erved Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tour|ville,</HI> the French Admiral, put out his Signal for Battel; I gave order that mine &s;hould not be hoi&s;ted till the Fleets began to engage, that he might have the fairer opportunity of coming as near me as he thought convenient, and at the &s;ame time, I &s;ent Orders to Admiral <HI>Almonde,</HI> that as &s;oon as any of his Squa|dron could Weather the Enemies Fleet, they &s;hould Tack, and get to the We&s;tward of them; as al&s;o to the Blue, to make &s;ail and clo&s;e the Line, they being at &s;ome di&s;tance a-&s;tern; but as &s;oon as the Fleet began to engage it fell calm, which prevented their &s;o doing. About half an Hour after eleven, Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Tourville</HI> in the <HI>Royal Sun</HI> (being within Three Quarters Mu&s;quet-&s;hot,) brought to, lying by me at that di&s;tance about an Hour and a half, plying his Guns very warmly; though I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that our Men fired their Guns fa&s;ter; after which time I did not find his Guns were fired with that vi|gour as before, and I could &s;ee him in great Di&s;order, his Rigging, Sails, and Top-&s;ail Yards, being &s;hot, and no body endeavouring to make them &s;ervice|able, and his Boats towing of him to Windward, gave me rea&s;on to think he was much gaul'd. About two the Wind &s;hifted to the N. W. and by W. and &s;ome little time after that Five fre&s;h Ships of the Enemies Blue Squadron came and po&s;ted them&s;elves, three a-head of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tourville,</HI> and two a-&s;tern of him, and fired with great Fury, which continued till after three. About four in the Evening there came &s;o thick a Fog, that we could not &s;ee a Ship of the Enemies, which occa&s;ioned our leaving off firing for a little time, and then it cleared up, and we could &s;ee Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tourville</HI> towing away with his Boats to the Northward from us; upon which I did the &s;ame, and ordered all my Divi&s;ion to do the like; and about half an Hour after Five, we had a &s;mall breeze of VVind Ea&s;terly. I then made the Signal for the Fleet to Cha&s;e, &s;ending Notice to all the Ships about me, that the Enemy were running. About this time I heard &s;everal Broad-&s;ides to the We&s;tward and, though I could not &s;ee the Ships that fired, I concluded them to be our Blue, that by the &s;hift of Wind had weathered the Enemy; but it proved to be the Reer-Admiral of the Red, who had weathered <HI>Tour|ville</HI>'s
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y"> Squadron, and got between them and their Admiral of the Blue, where they lay firing &s;ome time, and then <HI>Tourville</HI> anchored with &s;ome Ships of his own Divi&s;ion, as al&s;o the Reer-Admiral of the Red with &s;ome of his: This was the time that Captain <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> in the <HI>Sandwich</HI> was killed, he driving through tho&s;e Ships, by rea&s;on of his Anchors not being clear. I could not &s;ee this part, becau&s;e of the great Smoak and Fog, but have received this Informa|tion from Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovel</HI> &s;ince. I &s;ent to all the Ships that I could think were near me, to Cha&s;e to the We&s;tward all night; telling them, I de&s;igned to fol|low the Enemy to <HI>Bre&s;t;</HI> and &s;ometimes we could &s;ee a French Ship, two, or three, &s;tanding away with all the Sail they could make to the We&s;tward. About Eight I heard firing to the We&s;tward, which la&s;ted about half an hour, it being &s;ome of our Blue fallen in with &s;ome of the Ships of the Enemies in the Fog. 'Twas Foggy, and very little Wind all night.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 20th, 'twas &s;o thick in the morning, that I could &s;ee none of the Enemies Ships, and but very few of our own. About Eight it began to clear up; the Dutch, who were to the Southward of me, made the Signal of &s;eeing the Enemy; and, as it cleared, I &s;aw about 32 or 34 Sail, di&s;tant from us be|tween two and three Leagues, the Wind at E. N. E. and they bearing from us W. S W. our Fleet Cha&s;ing with all the Sail they could make, having taken in the Signal for the Line of Battle, that each Ship might make the be&s;t of her way after the Enemy. Between Eleven and Twelve, the Wind came to the S. W. The French ply'd to the We&s;tward with all the Sail they could, and we after them. About Four the Tide of Ebb being done, the French anchor'd, as al&s;o we in 43 Fathom Water, <HI>Cape Barfleur</HI> bearing S. and by W. About Ten in the Evening we weighed with the Tide of Ebb, the Wind at S. W. and ply'd to the We&s;tward. About Twelve my Fore-Topma&s;t came by the Board, having received &s;everal Shot.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 21&s;t, we continued &s;till plying after the Enemy, till Four in the morning. The Tide of Ebb being done, I anchored in 46 Fathom Water, <HI>Cape de Hague</HI> bearing S. and by W. and the <HI>I&s;land of Alderney</HI> S. S. W. By my Topma&s;t's going away, the Dutch Squadron, and the Admiral of the Blue, with &s;everal of his Squadron, had got a great way to Windward of me. About Seven in the morning &s;everal of the Enemies Ships, being far advanced towards the <HI>Race,</HI> I perceived driving to the Ea&s;tward with the Tide of Flood. Between Eight and Nine, when they were driven &s;o far to the Ea&s;tward that I could fetch them, I made the Signal for the Fleet to cut and follow the Ene|my; which they all did, except the aforementioned Weathermo&s;t Ships, which rid fa&s;t, to ob&s;erve the motion of the re&s;t of the Enemies Ships that continued in the <HI>Race of Alderney.</HI> About Eleven, I &s;aw three great Ships fair under the Shoar Tack and &s;tand to the We&s;tward: but after making two or three &s;hort Boards, the bigge&s;t of them run a&s;hoar, who pre&s;ently cut his Ma&s;ts away; the other two being to Leeward of him, ply'd up to him: The rea&s;on, as I judge, of their doing this was, that they could not weather our &s;ternmo&s;t Ships to the We&s;tward, nor get out a-head of Us to the Ea&s;tward. I ob&s;er|ving that many of our Ships hovered about tho&s;e, I &s;ent to Sir <HI>Ralph Delaval,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the Red, who was in the Reer of our Fleet, to keep &s;uch a number of Ships and Fire&s;hips with him, as might be &s;ufficient to de&s;troy tho&s;e of the Enemies; and to order the others to follow me, I being then in pur|&s;uit of the re&s;t of the Enemy: An Account of the performing that Service I don't trouble your Lord&s;hip with, He having given it you already. About Four in the afternoon 18 Sail of the Enemies Ships got to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Cape Barfleur;</HI> after which, I ob&s;erved they hawled in for <HI>le Hogue:</HI> The Reer-Admiral of the Red, Vice-Admiral of the Blue, and &s;ome other Ships, were
<PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y"> a-head of me. About Ten at night, I anchored in the Bay of <HI>le Hogue,</HI> and lay till Four the next morning, being</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 22d; and then I weighed, and &s;tood in near the Land of <HI>le Hogue:</HI> but when we found the Flood came, we anchored in good Sandy Ground. At Two in the afternoon we weighed again, and ply'd clo&s;e in with <HI>le Hogue,</HI> where we &s;aw 13 Sail of the Enemies Men of War hawled clo&s;e in with the Shoar: The Reer-Admiral of the Red tells me, That the night before he &s;aw the other five, which made up the 18 I fir&s;t cha&s;ed, &s;tand to the Ea&s;t|ward.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 23d, I &s;ent in Vice-Admiral <HI>Rooke,</HI> with &s;everal Men of War and Fire&s;hips, as al&s;o the Boats of the Fleet, to de&s;troy tho&s;e Ships: but the Enemy had gotten them &s;o near the Shoar, that not any of our Men of War, except the &s;mall Frigats, could do any Service; but that night Vice-Admiral <HI>Rooke</HI> with the Boats burnt &s;ix of them.</P>

<P><HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the 24th, About eight in the morning he went in again with the Boats, and Burnt the other &s;even, to|gether with &s;everal Tran&s;port Ships, and &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els with Ammunition, the Names of which Ships I am not yet able to give your Lord&s;hip any other Account of than what I formerly &s;ent you, which are in the Margin.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 25th, I Sailed from <HI>le Hogue,</HI> ordering the Admiral of the Blue, with a Squadron of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships under his Command, to run along the Enemies Coa&s;t as far as <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> in hopes that &s;ome of the beforementioned five Ships that &s;tood to the Ea&s;tward, might have been got thither; but he informs me, that upon his appearing before that place, he could perceive but one or two &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. The Number of the Enemies Ships did not exceed fifty Men of War, by the be&s;t information, from Fifty &s;ix to One hundred and four Guns; and tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that our number was &s;uperiour to theirs (which probably at fir&s;t might &s;tartle them) yet by their coming down with that Re&s;olution, I cannot think it had any great effect upon them; And this I may affirm for a Truth, not with any intention to value our own Action, or to le&s;&s;en the Bravery of the Enemy, That they were beaten by a Number con&s;iderably le&s;s than theirs; the Calmne&s;s and Thickne&s;s of the Weather giving very few of the Dutch or Blue the Opportunity of Engaging, which I am &s;ure they look upon as a great Misfortune; and, had the Weather proved otherwi&s;e, I do not &s;ee how 'twas po&s;&s;ible for any of them to have e&s;caped us.</P>

<P>This is the Exacte&s;t Account that I am able to give You, which I hope will prove to Your Lord&s;hip's Satisfaction.
