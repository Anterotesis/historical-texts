<HEAD>The Dreame.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>1. THe Dreame is this:</HI> One in a &s;hape diuine,</L>
<L>Tran&s;ported by the Windes as &s;wift as thought,</L>
<L>Who&s;e face more glorious then the Sunne did &s;hine,</L>
<L>Me to an vnknowne climat quickly brought,</L>
<L>Whereof &s;trange things that were within that Nation,</L>
<L>And of their natures he gaue true relation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>2.</HI> He &s;hewed me Oare of Gold, which being tried</L>
<L>As Mettals v&s;e to be in burning fire,</L>
<L>One &s;hould haue thought would haue beene purified,</L>
<L>But contrarie it turn'd to filthie mire,</L>
<L>And who&s;oeuer kept it afterward,</L>
<L>Should be with Sprights and Goblins &s;trangely &s;card.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>3.</HI> Be&s;ides the operation of this Oare</L>
<L>Was, who&s;oeuer toucht it, to make blinde</L>
<L>And &s;otti&s;h, &s;o that they could neuer more</L>
<L>Haue wit or &s;ight in any perfect kinde,</L>
<L>Except by bathing in one Riuer pure,</L>
<L>In Europe Northward where they might haue cure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>4.</HI> In this &s;trange Countrie al&s;o was a flower,</L>
<L>Which this good Angell had no &s;ooner gather'd,</L>
<L>But within one halfe quarter of an hower,</L>
<L>As a thing bla&s;ted &s;uddenly it wither'd,</L>
<L>And as the Marigold by the Sunne is &s;pread,</L>
<L>This by the Sunne &s;hut vp and &s;eem'd as dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>5.</HI> The Angell then transfer'd me to a Land,</L>
<L>Where huge deformed vgly Giants breed,</L>
<PB REF="4">
<L>Which &s;poil'd and burnt good corne which there did &s;tand,</L>
<L>And &s;et <HI>Tabacco</HI> that foule &s;tinking weede,</L>
<L>One bad me ta&s;te, but the Angell bad me leaue,</L>
<L>For that would me quite of my life bereaue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>6.</HI> For this is not a man as you &s;uppo&s;e,</L>
<L>But a black fiend which humane &s;hape a&s;&s;umes,</L>
<L>That takes <HI>Tabacco</HI> thus through mouth and no&s;e,</L>
<L>And brings from Hell the&s;e deuilli&s;h perfumes,</L>
<L>I &s;tarted back &s;eeing it was a Deuill,</L>
<L>And praied good Angell, &s;aue me from this euill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>7.</HI> Be not afraid quoth he, thou &s;halt that &s;ee</L>
<L>Before that we depart this wicked Land,</L>
<L>Which neuer eie beheld: And then to me</L>
<L>Appear'd damn'd creatures in the flames to &s;tand,</L>
<L>Th&s;e are <HI>Tabacconi&s;ts</HI> &s;aid he, that for this turne,</L>
<L>Did whilst they liu'd, before-hand learne to burne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>8.</HI> Then &s;uddenly he &s;natcht me vp and flew,</L>
<L>Vntill he came vnto a thick-&s;et Wood,</L>
<L>Where trees of all &s;orts many thou&s;ands grew,</L>
<L>And likewi&s;e Shrubs innumerable stood,</L>
<L>And looke how many Trees and Shrubs there were,</L>
<L>So many &s;euerall fruits they all did beare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>9.</HI> Some were like Apples, but were Crabs in ta&s;t,</L>
<L>And in the eating had but &s;owre dige&s;tion:</L>
<L>Some were as bitter as the Oaken ma&s;t,</L>
<L>More fit for &s;wine then any mags refection:</L>
<L>Some were delicious &s;weete, and perfect good,</L>
<L>Such as at fir&s;t in <HI>Edens</HI> Garden &s;tood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>10.</HI> But as that fruit was good and lu&s;hious,</L>
<L>The Scituation of the Trees was bad,</L>
<L>For none of them by meanes of Vnder-bu&s;hes,</L>
<L>Sufficient roome to &s;prout their branches had,</L>
<L>So th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> for want of elbow-roome, a Tree</L>
<L>Not halfe &s;o fruitfull was as el&s;e might bee.</L>
</LG>
<PB REF="4">
<LG>
<L><HI>11.</HI> Vnfruitfull briars choakt their &s;appy roote,</L>
<L>And with &s;harpe pricks did goad their tender Rinde,</L>
<L>Thornes would not let their &s;pringing Armes to &s;hoote,</L>
<L>Sprigs of wilde Trees about their branches twinde,</L>
<L>As if they all malicious enuie had</L>
<L>At that good fruit, &s;eeing their owne was bad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>12.</HI> Pitty it was the husband-mans re&s;pect,</L>
<L>Did not roote out the&s;e inconuenient lets;</L>
<L>He might haue remedied that great defect,</L>
<L>By burning vp tho&s;e preiudiciall &s;ets,</L>
<L>For tho&s;e Trees properly are made to burne,</L>
<L>As &s;ome to build, and &s;ome for other turne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>13.</HI> This when I had peru&s;ed curiou&s;ly,</L>
<L>The Angell led mee to a goodly Vine-yard,</L>
<L>Kept by a Tyrant, who &s;wore furiou&s;ly,</L>
<L>That hee would kill mee with his bloody whineyard.</L>
<L>The Angell &s;au'd mee, and compel'd him to</L>
<L>Declare the mi&s;chiefes which hee there did do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>14.</HI> Then thus the Tyrant timerou&s;ly &s;aid,</L>
<L>Northward from hence there is within a Land,</L>
<L>Amid&s;t the Sea, a fruitfull Paradice made,</L>
<L>Where goodly Vines in curious order &s;tand,</L>
<L>Which proue exceeding plentifull: And there</L>
<L>I &s;ometime great authoritie did beare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>15.</HI> And tho&s;e faire Vines to all e&s;tates were free,</L>
<L>As well the Plough-man as the Potentate,</L>
<L>And euery beggar might &s;ufficed bee,</L>
<L>Without controlement of the Magi&s;trate,</L>
<L>That all degrees by vertue of that Grape,</L>
<L>Grew perfect wi&s;e, &s;ober, temperate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>16.</HI> But I by craft and deuilli&s;h inuention,</L>
<L>De&s;iring their &s;ubuer&s;ion, cut tho&s;e Vines</L>
<L>Vn&s;ea&s;onably, to hinder their extention</L>
<L>In growth and &s;preading: And as oftentimes</L>
<PB REF="5">
<L>As J with blood the Rootes &s;hould haue made moist,</L>
<L>A poy&s;on &s;trong I clo&s;ely in did foist.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>17.</HI> Which to conceale from mens detection,</L>
<L>This trick I had, I &s;uffer'd none to come</L>
<L>Within that Paradice for to make collection,</L>
<L>But I my &s;elfe in per&s;on, or el&s;e &s;ome</L>
<L>Of my confederates, whom I put in tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Deliuer'd them how, and to whom we lu&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>18.</HI> Many di&s;ea&s;es heerevpon did grow,</L>
<L>The Ague, Pal&s;ey, Megrims, Scurfe and Scab,</L>
<L>The cau&s;e of &s;ickne&s;&s;es they did not know,</L>
<L>For no man of the Grapes &s;u&s;pition had.</L>
<L>By this I got at ending of their daies,</L>
<L>All that they had for Ro&s;emary and Bayes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>19.</HI> At length my helli&s;h purpo&s;e was de&s;cried</L>
<L>By one that vomited a poy&s;oned Grape,</L>
<L>By rea&s;on of an Antidote applied,</L>
<L>And all the Countrie then did beare me hate,</L>
<L>And for tho&s;e faults which I committed there,</L>
<L>They bani&s;ht me, and &s;o I thence came here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>20.</HI> And all the&s;e Vines which heere you planted &s;ee,</L>
<L>Are of that &s;ort, which I from thence did bring:</L>
<L>But I haue cau&s;ed other Weedes to bee</L>
<L>Set with them, that they may together &s;pring,</L>
<L>And both at one time put into the Pre&s;&s;e,</L>
<L>The Grapes and Weedes, to make a mingled me&s;&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>21.</HI> And to keepe well tho&s;e Weedes, I haue ordain'd,</L>
<L>They be continually vnderpropt with &s;takes,</L>
<L>By &s;uch as I haue purpo&s;ely retain'd,</L>
<L>Who in like ca&s;e for their owne lucre &s;akes,</L>
<L>Ten times more curious are to trimme and prime</L>
<L>Their branches, than the branches of the Vine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>22.</HI> This mingle mangle compo&s;ition,</L>
<L>Hath much be&s;otted all the Peoples braines,</L>
<PB REF="5">
<L>And &s;uch is their &s;ond &s;uppo&s;ition,</L>
<L>They hold him cur&s;t that from this drinke refraines:</L>
<L>The gaines being great for &s;elling of this Ale,</L>
<L>Hath lift my head as high as Dragons taile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>23.</HI> And all the Countrie call me Demy-god,</L>
<L>Bending their knees to me with great deuotion,</L>
<L>And offer Gold, Iewels and Emmerods,</L>
<L>And all they haue for this my potion:</L>
<L>But out alas, their blind inchaunted &s;ight</L>
<L>Sees not the Adder me that doth them bite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>24.</HI> And that my gaine may be enlarg'd the more,</L>
<L>I haue deui&s;'d a Law on Paine of death,</L>
<L>That none the Iuce of Grapes &s;hall ta&s;t, before</L>
<L>The Iuce of Weedes be mixt, whereby of breath</L>
<L>I haue bereaued thou&s;ands with this blade,</L>
<L>Which for that purpo&s;e onely I haue made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>25.</HI> The Angell an&s;wer'd, for this Impious fact,</L>
<L>A iudgement on thee &s;uddenly &s;hall come,</L>
<L>Wor&s;e then the Serpents cur&s;e, for his vilde Act</L>
<L>Which in deluding <HI>Euah</HI> he had done:</L>

<Q><HI>1</HI> &mdash; One in a &s;hape diuine,</Q>
<P>BY the&s;e words is meant the Spirit of Truth, the Re|uelation of the My&s;terie of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, the diuine and heauenly operation of the holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<Q>Tran&s;ported by the windes as &s;wift as thought,</Q>
<P>Which is in&s;pired, and breathed into our &s;oules, thoughts and con&s;ciences, from the mouth of the mo&s;t &s;acred Trini|tie: as <HI>Acts</HI> 2.2. it is &s;aid, that when the Apo&s;tles receiued the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>&s;uddenly there came a &s;ound from heauen, as of a ru&s;hing, and mighty winde, and it filled all the hou&s;e where they &s;ate.</HI></P>
<Q>Who&s;e face more gloious then the Sunne did &s;hine.</Q>
<P>The Word of Truth may well be &s;aid to be farre more glorious then the Sun in brightnes and &s;hining, in re&s;pect of the integritie and eternitie, thereof: for the Sun onely giueth light vnto the outward eyes, to guide our naturall feete from &s;tumbling: But this gratious vi&s;itation in Chri&s;t Ie&s;us hath lightned the darkne&s;&s;e of our hearts, to guide our mindes and affections, le&s;t we &s;tumble at errors and deadly &s;innes, and &s;o fall into perdition. S. <HI>Iohn</HI> 1.4. &s;peaking of the worthines of the word, &s;aith, <HI>It was life, and the life</HI> (mea|ning Chri&s;t Ie&s;us) <HI>was the light of men.</HI></P>
<Q>Me to an vnknowne Climate quickly brought.</Q>
<P>By this is to be vnder&s;tood a Repre&s;entation vnto vs of &s;uch places, where the light of the Go&s;pell hath not yet &s;hined, and where the word of Truth is not yet preached, as among&s;t the Heathen people, Pagans, Infidels, Virgini|ans, and other the like barbarous and bruiti&s;h Nations,
<PB N="2" REF="8">and as it was with vs Gentiles in the time of the Law be|fore our vocation, as it is written, <HI>wee were &s;ometimes &s;tran|gers from the promi&s;e, Eph.</HI> 2.12.</P>
<Q><L>Where of Strange things that were within that Nation,</L>
<L>And of their Natures he gaue true relation.</L></Q>
<P>That is, the Spirit of grace doth demon&s;trate vnto vs, the &s;trange Religions and Here&s;ies of tho&s;e forraine Nati|ons, their vaine &s;uper&s;titions, and blinde Idolatrie, and the effects and euents of their errors: 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.5. <HI>He will lighten things that are hid in darkne&s;&s;e, and make the Councels of the hearts manife&s;t.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>2</HI> He &s;hewed me Oare of Gold, &mdash;</Q>
<P>All is not gold that gli&s;tereth, neither is this meant to be materiall Oare, but that which indeed (if it had beene of the right touch) would haue been farre more pretious then gold. It is meant by their Religion, which being of a coun|terfeit &s;tampe, is but a <HI>&s;uperficies,</HI> faire without, but dro&s;&s;e within; for in&s;tead of wor&s;hipping the liuing God, they adore a dead Idol of gold, and &s;ometimes of wood and &s;tone: &s;ome of them al&s;o wor&s;hip the Sun, the Moone, and the Starres; &s;ome put their tru&s;t in their Coyne, &s;aying, with the couetous mi&s;er, <HI>Pecunia omnia pote&s;t:</HI> I pray God too many of tho&s;e Idolaters be not among&s;t vs; nay, &s;ome wor&s;hip the Deuill him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>We reade in the 2. <HI>King.</HI> 16.3. <HI>That Ahaz King of Ieru|&s;alem made his &s;onne to goe thorow the fire, after the abhomi|nations of the Heathen, as a Sacrifice to the Idol Molech.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o, in the 2. <HI>Kings</HI> 21. It is &s;aid of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eth,</HI> that <HI>he built the high places which Hezekiah his father had de&s;troied, and he erected vp Altars for Baal, and made a groue as did A|hab King of I&s;rael, and wor&s;hipped all the hoa&s;t of Heauen, and &s;erued them.</HI></P>
<P>And as in tho&s;e times, <HI>they wor&s;hipped the Gods of their Na|tions,</HI> 2. <HI>King.</HI> 17.29. So is it now with tho&s;e ignorant incre|dulous
<PB N="3" REF="8">people in our daies which know not the true God.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;which being tried,</L>
<L>As mettals v&s;e to be, in burning fire,</L>
<L>One &s;hould haue thought would haue beene purified,</L>
<L>But contrarie it turn'd to filthy Mire,</L></Q>
<P>The Go&s;pell of Chri&s;t Ie&s;us is compared to a burning fire, mo&s;t vehement, which maketh a change of things through all the World: as in <HI>Luk</HI> 12.49. Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>I am come to put fire on the earth,</HI> &s;peaking of the Go&s;pell, &s;o then this is the meaning of the la&s;t ver&s;es, That the Religion of tho&s;e Idolaters and Heathen people, being compared and examined with our Catholike and Apo&s;tolike Doctrine, it needes no other touch&s;tone, it &s;hewes both in&s;ide and out|&s;ide, that in re&s;pect thereof it is ba&s;e and vilde, and as durt and dro&s;&s;e to pure gold, as a pibble-&s;tone to a pretious Di|amond.</P>
<P>If we diligently peru&s;e the Scriptures, we &s;hall finde that Idolatrie is forbidden 500. times in the New and Old Te|&s;tament with &s;euere puni&s;hments: And God him&s;elfe for the vilde wickedne&s;&s;e and abhomination thereof, hath pro|nounced that <HI>the enti&s;ers of Idolatrie &s;eeme they neuer &s;o holy &s;hould be &s;laine, Deut.</HI> 13.5.</P>
<P><HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Tree whereby Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e commeth, but that is cur&s;ed that is made with hands, both it and he that made it: He becau&s;e he made it, and it being a corruptible thing, becau&s;e it was called God, Wi&s;d.</HI> 14.7.8.</P>
<Q><L>And who&s;oeuer kept it afterward</L>
<L>Should be with &s;prights and goblins &s;trangely &s;card.</L></Q>
<P>Heere is to be noted, that after our con&s;ciences haue beene throughly tried, by the word of God, and that we haue receiued by the &s;pirit of Grace the knowledge of Chri&s;t Ie&s;us, if we reuolt againe from the truth, to &s;erue &s;trange Gods, the Lord will giue vs ouer to the temptati|ons of Satan, hardne&s;&s;e of heart, blindne&s;&s;e of vnder&s;tan|ding,
<PB N="4" REF="9">and will bring vpon vs warre, famine, and all the cur&s;es mentioned in the Booke of his Law, and in the end death and de&s;truction, &amp; after death perpetuall damnation.</P>
<P>It is euident in diuers places of the Old Te&s;tament in euery booke, that the Kings of I&s;raell &s;o long as they kept the Commandements of God, and ob&s;erued his Lawes, as the Lord hath appointed, not according to their owne ima|ginations, they pro&s;pered in all their doings, and many ble&s;&s;ings were vpon them: But when they went a whore|ing after &s;trange Gods, the vengeance and wrath of God came vpon them with many heauy cur&s;es pronounced: whereof reade 2. <HI>King.</HI> 17.7. <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.20. al&s;o 23.32.33. <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. from 2. <HI>ver&s;e</HI> to 8. al&s;o 29. from the 18. to the la&s;t <HI>ver&s;e.</HI> al&s;o 30.17.18. <HI>Reuel.</HI> 21.8.</P>

<P>Heere are de&s;cribed the effects of Idolatrie, blindne&s;&s;e and dulne&s;&s;e of vnder&s;tanding: So heere are blinde Gods, and blinde People:</P>
<P>2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 5.8. When king <HI>Dauid</HI> and his men went to Ieru|&s;alem vnto the Iebu&s;ites, he promi&s;ed preferment to tho&s;e that would &s;mite the <HI>Lame and Blinde,</HI> meaning the Idols which his &s;oule hated, as the text mentioneth.</P>
<P>And <HI>Salom. Wi&s;d.</HI> 14.26.27. &s;aith, that <HI>the wor&s;hipping of Idols, which ought not to be named, is the beginning and the cau&s;e and end of all euill, for either they be mad, when they be merrie, or prophe&s;ie lies, or liue vngodly, or el&s;e lightly for&s;weare them&s;elues.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o writing to the <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.17.18.19. ex|horteth them <HI>that they will not walke as other Gentiles, in va|nity of their minde, hauing their cogitation darkened, and be|ing &s;trangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the hardne&s;&s;e of their hearts, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<P> And it may be truely applied vnto them that is &s;poken by <HI>I&s;a.</HI> the Prophet <HI>cap.</HI> 59.10. <HI>They grope for the wall like the blinde, and as one without eies, they &s;tumble in the noone-day, as in the twilight, and they are in &s;olitarie places as dead Men.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Except by bathing in one Riuer pure,</L>
<L>In Europe Northward where they might haue cure.</L></Q>
<P>The word of God in diuers places of the Scripture is likened to Riuers and waters, whereby is meant, that if tho&s;e Idolatrous Nations haue recour&s;e to the holy Scrip|tures as they are now profe&s;&s;ed and taught in the Church of Great Britaine, they &s;hall be deliuered and freed from their blindne&s;&s;e and ignorance.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn</HI> 4.14. <HI>Who&s;oeuer drinketh of the water</HI> (&s;aith Chri&s;t) <HI>that I &s;hall giue him, &s;hall neuer be more a thir&s;t, but the water that I &s;hall giue him, &s;hall be in him a well of water &s;pringing vp into euerla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ezech.</HI> 47.8.9. The Scriptures are called whole&s;ome wa|ters, in the&s;e words, <HI>The&s;e waters i&s;&s;ue out toward the Ea&s;t Countrie, and runne downe into the plaine, and &s;hall goe into one Sea, and the waters &s;hall be whole&s;ome, and euery thing which moueth where&s;oeuer the Riuers come &s;hall liue, and there &s;hall be a very great multitude of fi&s;h, becau&s;e the&s;e waters &s;hall come thither, for they &s;hall be whole&s;ome, and euery thing &s;hall liue whither the Riuer commeth.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o in the 36. <HI>ver.</HI> 25. Gods Spirit is compared to cleane water, where the Lord &s;aith, <HI>I will pure cleane water vpon you, and ye &s;hall be cleane, yea, from all your filthine&s;&s;e, and from all your Idols will I clen&s;e you.</HI></P>
<P>And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> writing to the <HI>Eph. cap.</HI> 5. <HI>ver.</HI> 26.27. &s;heweth how Chri&s;t &s;anctifieth and clen&s;eth his Church by the wa&s;hing of water through the word, that he might make it vnto him&s;elfe a glorious Church, not hauing &s;pot or wrinckle or any &s;uch thing, <HI>but that it &s;hould be holy and without blame.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="10">
<P> La&s;tly, Bapti&s;me (which the&s;e Heathen people haue not) is a token, that God hath con&s;ecrated the Church to him|&s;elfe, and made it holy by his word, that is, his promi&s;e of free iu&s;tification and &s;anctification in Chri&s;t.</P>
<Q><L><HI>4.</HI> In this &s;trange Countrie al&s;o was a flower</L>
<L>Which this good Angell had no &s;ooner gather'd,</L>

<L>As a thing bla&s;ted, &s;uddenly it wither'd,</L>
<L>And as the Marigould by the Sun is &s;pread,</L>
<L>This by the Sunne &s;hut vp and &s;eem'd as dead.</L></Q>
<P>Certaine it is, that there is a flower in the Indies, which when the Sun &s;hineth it &s;huts it &s;elfe clo&s;e, as a Marigould openeth by the Sun. And there is a Tree called the &s;hame|fac'd-Tree, which groweth very faire and greene, who&s;e leafe if you touch, though you pluck it not from the Tree, yet it will &s;hrinke together for a &s;ea&s;on, like as if it &s;hould wither, and &s;o continue vntill your departure from that place, but the purpo&s;e heere is not to di&s;couer naturall cau|&s;es, but to make Spirituall v&s;e.</P>
<P>Therefore, By this flower, is &s;ignified the weake faith of the&s;e Infidels, which as it is little or none at all, &s;o it hath no &s;ure foundation whereupon it is built, and therefore cannot &s;tand again&s;t the power of the &s;pirit of truth, no more then the Idol <HI>Dagon</HI> did before the Arke of the Lord, whereof it is written, 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 5.2 3.4. <HI>That the Phili&s;tines tooke the Arke of God, and brought it into the hou&s;e of their chiefe Idol Dagon, and &s;et it by Dagon, And when they of A&s;hdod ro&s;e the next day in the morning, behold Dagon was fallen vpon his face on the ground before the Arke of the Lord, And they tooke vp Da|gon and &s;et him in his place againe, And they ro&s;e vp early in the morning next day, and behold Dagon was fallen againe vpon his face on the ground before the Arke of the Lord, and the head of Dagon and the two palmes of his hands were cut off vpon the thre&s;hold, onely the &s;tumpe of Dagon was left to him:</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="10">And &s;o is it with this flower which properly I cannot call Faith, &s;eeing the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> 2. <HI>The&s;.</HI> 3.2. &s;aith, <HI>all men haue not faith,</HI> but it is a kinde of blinde zeale in their blinde Re|ligion, which at the appearance and tryall of the &s;pirit of God withereth like a flower.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e, and of the Spirit, and may be &s;aid to proceed from a true zealous Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P><HI>Gal.</HI> 5.22. <HI>The fruit of the Spirit is Loue, Ioy, Peace, Long|&s;uffering, Gentlene&s;&s;e, Goodne&s;&s;e, Faith, Meekene&s;&s;e, and Tem|perance.</HI></P>

<P>Many times it fals out that the godly are hindred by the
<PB N="15" REF="15">wicked, that they cannot &s;hew their good workes in &s;uch mea&s;ure as they would. For the profe&s;&s;ion of the true Go&s;pell of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, is oftentimes ecclip&s;ed in them by the darke cloudy meetings, and mixture of Here&s;ies of o|thers, among whom they liue, &s;o that it doth not &s;hine with his perfect light, e&s;pecially among &s;uch as either refu&s;e to heare the Go&s;pell of Chri&s;t at all, or el&s;e if they heare it, they will peruert it, and make the con&s;truction thereof ac|cording to their owne fanta&s;ies. So the&s;e vngodly people are compared to vnder-bu&s;hes, that hinder the propagati|on of Gods holy word, and the growing and pro&s;pering of the fruits of the Spirit.</P>
<P>And they are like to the Phari&s;es, that neither would be|lieue the Go&s;pell them&s;elues, nor &s;uffer others to belieue, <HI>Math.</HI> 23.13. Add like to the Iewes &s;poken of in the 17. Chapter of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, where <HI>Paul</HI> being in The&s;&s;alonica, (as his manner was) went into their Syna|gogue, opening and alleadging, <HI>that Chri&s;t mu&s;t haue &s;uffe|red and ri&s;en againe from the dead,</HI> and &s;ome belieued, but the Iewes which belieued not, tooke vnto them certaine va|gabonds, and wicked fellowes, and made a tumult in the Citie, and would haue brought <HI>Paul</HI> out to the people.</P>
<Q><L><HI>11.</HI> Vnfruitfull briars choakt their &s;appy roote,</L>

<L>Sprigs of wilde Trees about their branches twinde,</L>
<L>As if they all malicious enuie had</L>
<L>At that good fruit, &s;eeing their owne was bad.</L></Q>
<P>Enuie is one of the fruits of the fle&s;h, as before mentio|ned, and therefore is altogether repugnant to the Spirit. And heere is demon&s;trated vnto vs, the malice of the Chil|dren of the Deuill again&s;t the Children of God. Accor|ding as Chri&s;t &s;aith to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Yee &s;hall be hated of all men for my &s;ake, Math.</HI> 10.22. They that doe maintaine tho&s;e wicked Here&s;ies, and vaine inuentions, haue their eies euill,

<P>But that is not all the hurt they doe, to be vnfruitfull in them&s;elues, for the nature of &s;uch bryars and thornes is to make the ground barren round about where they grow, and to hinder the growth of any thing, that is neere there|unto.</P>
<P>And they may be &s;aid to be wilde Trees, which haue not the knowledge of truth grafted in their hearts, of which there are too many in that place, and tho&s;e of &s;eueral Sects, &s;o that it is now with the good Prote&s;tant in that place, as it was with the Children of I&s;raell, who being but one people in their iourney to the Land of promi&s;e, met with diuers Nations that re&s;i&s;ted them; &amp; being there is but one truth, which the Prote&s;tants profe&s;&s;e, there they are much cum|bred and troubled with many hoa&s;tes of Errors, but as the Lord euer gaue the Conque&s;t to the I&s;raelites, &s;o no doubt he will be to the Prote&s;tants.</P>

And likewi&s;e in goodly fruitfull Orchards, where trees are pe&s;tered thick together, the bad trees that are vnfruitfull, hinder the pro&s;pering of the good trees, that they cannot be &s;o fruitfull as otherwi&s;e they might be.
