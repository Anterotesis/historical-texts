<P>_THe <HI>Belgick</HI> Pro|vinces for the la&s;t Century have been &s;uch a Thea|tre of <HI>Mars,</HI> that all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> have little rea&s;on to thank the <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
<PB REF="4"> for enforcing the States of <HI>Holland</HI> to know and u&s;e their own power and &s;trength; and therefore it was gravely expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ober Per&s;on, that to have all the Low Coun|tries governed by a few States, or by one Prince, wholly de|pending upon the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> would be equally dan|gerous: but it doth mo&s;t com|port with the intere&s;t of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in Wi&s;dom and Policy, to erect and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a Prince as &s;hould neither alto|gether depend upon <HI>France,</HI> or be wholly devoted unto <HI>Spain;</HI> or el&s;e to divide the Seventeen Provinces into di|vers
<PB REF="4"> &s;everal Cantons, whereby &s;ome of them being induced to affect <HI>England,</HI> and others to favour Princes of their Re|ligion, they could not render them&s;elves &s;o formidable.</P>
<P>How prudent an expedient this would be for the &s;ecurity of <HI>England,</HI> and to e&s;tabli&s;h peace in Chri&s;tendom, I &s;ubmit it unto your Lord&s;hips grave judgement, who is perfectly acquainted with all the Criti|ci&s;mes of State. But that which is the ju&s;t admiration of all wi&s;e men, the le&s;&s;er moie|ty of the&s;e Provinces hath far exceeded even the whole, and &s;even Provinces are become
<PB REF="5"> greater and more potent then Seventeen: In Riches and Power they have out-done &s;ome of the greate&s;t Princes in <HI>Europe.</HI> Their Cities are many and &s;plendid; and yet there are more Sects among them then Cities, and as ma|ny Creeds as Heads: but if they had imitated your Lord|&s;hip when you did them the honour to live among&s;t them, (the regularity of your De|votions being with &s;uch re|verence) you had made all their Provinces Canonical: yet they have learned to verni&s;h their lucre with De|votion, and to make godli|ne&s;s
<PB REF="5"> a Page to their pri|vate Intere&s;t, and to be &s;o wi&s;e in any of their meet|ings never to di&s;cour&s;e of Religion; their Opinions therein, being as oppo&s;ite as the &s;ides of the Diameter; but they all concentre in this one Ecliptick line, to darken the Authority of Princes.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip (being &s;o great an Artizan of State) under&s;tands all their <HI>Arca|na</HI> and My&s;teries; and &s;o great a Captain, as (this AGE with much difficulty hath not produced a greater) you know all their Policies and
<PB REF="6"> Stratagems of War; by the fir&s;t your Lord&s;hip hath much en|gaged your own Nation; by the other, you may live to oblige all Nations of the World.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_LE&s;t thou &s;houl|de&s;t have cau&s;e <HI>(Gentle Rea|der)</HI> to <HI>Quaere</HI> this pre&s;ent E|dition of the Exact Survey of the &V;nited Provinces of the Netherlands, con&s;idering the many E&s;&s;ays written of that Subject; at the
<PB REF="7"> in&s;tance of the worthy Author of this excellent and u&s;eful Di&s;cour&s;e, I was de&s;ired to adverti&s;e thee, that &s;ome honourable Friends of his put him upon this pre&s;ent work, which in their noble concepti|ons would be very acceptable to the Publick. By this To|pographical Di&s;cour&s;e thou art brought to more familiar acquaintance with the &s;cite, &s;trength, pre&s;ent &s;tate and con|dition of tho&s;e Belgick Coun|tries, which for this la&s;t Cen|tury had &s;o bravely quit them|&s;elves, maugre the utmo&s;t Po|licies and Ho&s;tilities of their great and formidable Enemies:
<PB REF="7"> and when you hear of this or that other Town or Ca&s;tle of theirs either taken or be&s;ieged, upon a &s;light peru&s;al of it, up|on all occa&s;ions, you may be a|ble to judge of tho&s;e matters. The Author hereof hath &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ulted with mo&s;t of the Grave Writers both Co&s;mogra|phers &amp; Hi&s;torians, and others of the greate&s;t note which have hitherto written of tho&s;e Coun|tries and Provinces, from whom (be&s;ides his own ob&s;ervations) he hath received no &s;mall light &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;tance: &amp; having brought this Web out of the Loom, he here pre&s;ents it to the judicious Eye of the Candid Reader,
<PB REF="8"> wherein, without much trouble or co&s;t, he may behold the &s;ad face in its full dimen&s;ion, of the late mo&s;t High and Mighty States of the &V;nited Pro|vinces, that &s;eemed &s;o lately to eclip&s;e and &s;hadow much of the Grandeur and Glory of the mo&s;t Potent and ab&s;olute Princes, now lamentably it &s;elf eclip&s;ed, and rent in pieces; and Peace, the faire&s;t flower in Paradi&s;e, and the plea&s;ante&s;t Fruit upon the Tree of Life, is here in Ex|ile: &s;o that you may &s;ay of them, as the Poet of <HI>Rome:</HI>
<Q><L>Qui mi&s;erandae videt veteris ve&s;tigia <HI>Romae,</HI></L>
<L>Ille pote&s;t merito dicere <HI>Roma</HI> fuit.</L></Q>
<Q><PB REF="8">
<L><HI>They who the Ruines of fir&s;t</HI> Rome <HI>behold,</HI></L>
<L><HI>May &s;ay,</HI> Rome <HI>is not now, but was of old.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>If in <HI>Anno 1584,</HI> the <HI>poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People of the Low Countries</HI> was their Epithet in all their humble Addre&s;&s;es to the then Queen of <HI>England,</HI> what they then &s;pake as Politi|cians, po&s;&s;ibly the &s;ame they may now &s;ay as Reali&s;ts. But Pride will have its Fall &s;ooner or later; Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and In|gratitude will never go long unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>And truly three of the har|de&s;t things in the world are,
<PB REF="9"> To Quadrate a Circle; to finde out the Philo&s;ophers Stone; and to make the Dutch grate|ful. The fir&s;t Office of Grati|tude is to receive a good turn Civilly, then to retain it in Me|mory, and acknowledge it; and la&s;tly, to endeavour a requital. How far they are from the&s;e, their In&s;olencies to the Engli&s;h Nation will ea&s;ily tell you; they daily do heap injuries on the Engli&s;h whom they have &s;o highly wronged, as if the latter injuries would give counte|nance of Ju&s;tice to the former: and to &s;peak truly, if we &s;hould be left to their mercies, we &s;hould be &s;tript as bare as <HI>Dio|genes</HI> did <HI>Plato</HI>'s Man.</P>
<PB REF="9">
<P>'Twas <HI>England</HI> that fir&s;t rai&s;ed them, and it was the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> that un|der God would have pre&s;erved and protected them, if they had kept their Ancient Boundaries, and not been too ignorant of their true Intere&s;t. At pre&s;ent they &s;eem to the world a lo&s;t People, full of intrin&s;ick confu|&s;ions, and upon the point of Ru|ine; and they that have been reckoned for Great and Domi|nical Letters in the Worlds Alphabet, are now almo&s;t blot|ted out.</P>
<P>For their Country, it was in the General for its dimen&s;ions, fuller planted with People, Ci|ties,
<PB REF="10"> Great Towns, Ca&s;tles, For|tre&s;&s;es, Bulwarks, Forts, Gar|ri&s;ons, and for Military De|fence, then any other Countrie in Europe. Their Naval For|ces were prodigious, befitting Wonder rather then Words, e|ven a Terrour to the Great Princes of the World. For their trade, it far exceeded that of the Neighbouring Princes; and in the Oeconomy of it more prudently managed. To every town they a&s;&s;igned &s;ome Staple-Commodity; As to <HI>Dort</HI> the Germane Wines and Corn: To <HI>Middleburgh</HI> the French and Spani&s;h Wines: To <HI>Trevere</HI> the Scotch Trade: In <HI>Leyden,</HI>
<PB REF="10"> in re&s;pect of her long Siege, was erected an &V;niver&s;ity: to <HI>Har|lem</HI> Knitting and Weaving; and to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> formerly (now <HI>Dort</HI>) the Engli&s;h Cloth: this maketh their Towns &s;o equally rich and po|pulous.</P>
<P>The Hollanders (the be&s;t Copy of Thrift in Chri&s;tendom) teach their little Ditches to bear Boats; not that their Wa|ters are more docible in this kinde then ours, but they are the more ingenious and indu|&s;trious School-Ma&s;ters of the le&s;&s;on of publique advantage, making every place in their Provinces to have acce&s;s to
<PB REF="11"> others therein, by &s;uch cheap tran&s;portation: A thing much to be de&s;ired in <HI>England;</HI> and certainly this great Metropolis, and other Cities here, would at|tain to much more grandeur and riches, if more navigable Rivers were made unto them: for nothing can more advance Trade, or rai&s;e a better Nur&s;ery of Sea-men.</P>
<P>Their Buildings are Splen|did and Magnificent. In many places, as in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> the Foundations of their Hou&s;es co&s;t more then the Super&s;tru|cture; for the Ground being low and &s;pungy, they are con|&s;train'd to ram in huge &s;takes of
<PB REF="11"> Timber till they come to a firm Ba&s;is; &s;o that one &s;aid, Who&s;o|ever could &s;ee <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> un|der Ground, &s;hould &s;ee a huge Winter-Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>But of the&s;e, as of their more Ancient and Noble Families, the Famous Men of their Coun|tries for Learning and Ex|ploits of War, their rare Mo|numents and other admirable Rarities to be found among&s;t them, with many other remark|ables, which for thy more am|ple &s;atisfaction I &s;hall refer thee to the following di&s;cour&s;e, wherein our Author hath gravely and judiciou&s;ly with &s;ingular method and brevity
<PB REF="12"> &s;et each memorable particular to thy View, in which thou wilt meet with many Occurrences worthy of thy admiration; having not only equall'd the be&s;t of &s;uch Writers as have hitherto treated on this Sub|ject, but far out-done them all: And therefore I &s;hall no ways doubt of thy candid Interpre|tation of this his very lauda|ble and worthy Enterprize; a&s;&s;uring thee that thy friendly reception of the&s;e his pre&s;ent Labours, will &s;trongly invite him to commend unto thy judi|cious con&s;ideration another Political Di&s;cour&s;e, di&s;cove|ring their Arts and Intrigues
<PB REF="12"> by which they have attained to their Grandeur; a Book which will be of great concern and advantage to the Engli&s;h Nation.</P>
<P>Of the great plea&s;ure and utility, and the excellent u&s;e that will be found in the &s;eri|ous peru&s;al of Books of this kind, I &s;hall need to &s;ay nothing, though I fir&s;t principally in|tended it, it being a truth &s;o generally received amongst all Judicious Readers; only I &s;hall tell thee, thou ha&s;t here <HI>Mag|num in parvo,</HI> or <HI>Iliades in nuce,</HI> or the late High and Mighty States of the <HI>United Netherlands</HI> with all their
