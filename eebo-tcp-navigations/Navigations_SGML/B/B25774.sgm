<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Good Fortune which has always at|tended me by Sea and Land, in my la&s;t Travels in|to the <HI>Levant,</HI> incourages me to pre&s;ume, that that &s;ame Providence, which more
<PB REF="4"> e&s;pecially a&s;&s;igns certain <HI>Ge|nius's</HI> to watch over the &s;afety of &s;uch Per&s;ons, which it culls out for the Execution of the greate&s;t Enterpri&s;es, ca&s;t an Eye upon me, from the very Moment that I de|parted from <HI>London,</HI> with a Re&s;olution to find your Lord&s;hip out, in whatever part of the World you were. That Providence doubtle&s;s it was, which having &s;natch'd me from the gaping Jaws of Dragons in <HI>France,</HI> and deliver'd me from &s;everal dangers and hazards which I ran both upon the one and the other Sea, diverted al&s;o
<PB REF="4"> from my Heart the Sharp pointed Dagger of a <HI>Megera,</HI> which Hell it &s;elf had vo|mited up to overwhelm me at <HI>Venice:</HI> This Providence it was that &s;taid a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> for &s;even Months together, till the day that I arriv'd to embark my &s;elf for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> &amp; to be there before your Lord&s;hip was to depart, in pur&s;uance of other Voyages quite contra|ry to the Advantage of your Affairs, and which I could never di&s;cover. At length being happily return'd home under the Conduct of your &s;ucce&s;sful Patronage, after
<PB REF="5"> I had travell'd Six thou&s;and nine hundred Miles by Sea or by Land in four Months time, I flatter'd my &s;elf, that in Dedicating to your Lord|&s;hip this little Piece, which departs from my Study upon a Voyage to the Republick of the Curious, it might find the &s;ame Good Fortune as the Author of it. Tho' indeed a &s;tronger Rea&s;on oblig'd me to procure it this Honour; that is to &s;ay, the Grandeur of a Name which has pre&s;erv'd it &s;elf untar|ni&s;h d in the Nobility of your Family for many Ages, even till this very day in
<PB REF="5"> your own Illu&s;trious Per&s;on. For you are de&s;cended from that Great <HI>Hero,</HI> who a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> to lay the Foundations of a Mo|narchy, which the Sword of your Ance&s;tors has ever &s;ince upheld with the hazard of their Lives. Witne&s;s that Thunder-bolt of War, the Decea&s;ed Earl your Father, who for having taken up Arms in the defence of the King his Ma&s;ter, had lo&s;t his Head, had not the Ven|geance of Heaven cru&s;ht the Tyrant who had condemn'd him by the means of a &s;mall number of Judges and Ju|ry
<PB REF="6"> Men, that then acknow|ledg'd no other Law than Ab&s;olute Power. And your Lord&s;hip, the true Off-&s;pring of &s;o many Hero's, tracing their Glorious Examples, declar'd your &s;elf again&s;t your be&s;t Friend, &s;o &s;oon as he appear'd to be an Enemy to the King his Father, who&s;e Arms your Prowe&s;s caus'd to be redoubted, both in <HI>Flanders</HI> and wherever el&s;e the Honour of his Com|mands carry'd you. I could &s;ay much more, but that your Mode&s;ty obliges me to &s;ilence. But to what purpo&s;e &s;hould I be multiplying
<PB REF="6"> words, when your own Acti|ons them&s;elves &s;ufficiently Proclaim the re&s;t, as well as your Per&s;on, which alone attracts the Affection and E&s;teem of all that have the advantage to know tho&s;e ex|cellent Qualities with which God has endow'd your Lord|&s;hip; and of which I wi&s;h your Lord&s;hip a happy and long Enjoyment.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Had written in my time &s;e|veral Volumes upon &s;eve|ral Subjects, which after|wards I threw into the Fire; as well for that they di&s;lik'd me (for I am a very &s;evere Cen&s;u|rer of my own works,) as for that I did not think them proper for the Genius of the Age, more inclin'd to trifles than to &s;erious things. Neverthele&s;s I was mer|ciful to the Memory of my Ad|ventures, not &s;o much for any
<PB REF="8"> E&s;teem which I had of them, but that I might leave my Chil|dren &s;ettl'd in a Foreign Coun|try the Con&s;olation of knowing whence they came, and by what Accident they happen'd to be born. Afterwards under&s;tanding by the Conver&s;ation which I had had with the Book&s;ellers, that Books of Travels were agreeable to the Palates of mo&s;t Readers, the Inclination which I have had all my life to be &s;erviceable to Mankind, made me re&s;olve to publi&s;h this &s;mall Part of mine, at lea&s;t to give &s;ome few hours Diverti&s;ement to the Publick by reading them; with this Pro|mi&s;e, that if this &s;mall E&s;&s;ay
<PB REF="8"> find acceptance, they &s;hall have the whole Journal entire. The Im|pre&s;&s;ion was begun in <HI>French</HI> the la&s;t year; at what time finding my &s;elf oblig'd to return into the <HI>Levant,</HI> upon the occa&s;ion which I have hinted in the preceding Epi&s;tle, I de&s;ir'd the Printer to &s;top his Pre&s;s till my return, be|cau&s;e I de&s;ir'd to over&s;ee it. In the mean time he had caus'd my Copy to be Tran&s;lated into <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> which I view'd and found faithfully done. After which ha|ving re&s;tor'd him his Tran&s;lation to do what he pleas'd with it, he de&s;ir'd me to an&s;wer &s;ome Ob|jections which had been made in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<PB REF="9">
<P>In the fir&s;t Place they will hardly believe the Shipwrack which I &s;uffered in my Third year, nor the manner how I e|&s;caped. Neverthele&s;s there is no|thing more certain than what I have &s;aid of it: be&s;ides other Circum&s;tances, which I have o|mitted which would &s;eem yet more incredible. All the City of <HI>Lyons,</HI> which is the Place of my Nativity, was at that time fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it; I was there lookt upon as another <HI>Mo|&s;es.</HI> Neither am I &s;o old, but that there are &s;till Per&s;ons alive that can te&s;tifie the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> They will have <HI>Heliopo|lis</HI> to have been in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> I
<PB REF="9"> confe&s;s it; but that is not the <HI>Heliopolis</HI> I &s;peak of. But as there are at this time &s;everal Cities of the &s;ame name; as <HI>Frankfort</HI> upon the <HI>Maine, Frankfort</HI> upon the <HI>Oder; Ly|ons</HI> upon the <HI>Saone,</HI> and <HI>Ly|on le Saulnier;</HI> or <HI>Lyons</HI> where the Saltpits are, be&s;ides <HI>Leiden</HI> which the <HI>Latins</HI> call <HI>Lugdunum</HI> al&s;o: <HI>Chalon</HI> up|on the <HI>Saone,</HI> and <HI>Chalons</HI> upon the <HI>Marne; Valence</HI> in the <HI>Dauphinate,</HI> and <HI>Valence</HI> in <HI>Spain:</HI> Why mu&s;t it be deny'd, but that be&s;ides <HI>Helio|polis</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> there may be that other of which I have given the Relation in <HI>Tartary.</HI> They
<PB REF="10"> who never &s;aw more than their own Village, never imagin that Steeples are of any other fa&s;hion than their own. <HI>Lactantius</HI> and St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> laught at tho&s;e who by the dictates of &s;ound &s;ence af|firm'd there were <HI>Antipodes.</HI> And a <HI>German</HI> Bi&s;hop was ac|cus'd for a Heretick before Pope <HI>Zachary</HI> upon the &s;ame &s;core. And if <HI>Columbus</HI> had not di&s;cover'd the way where o|thers follow'd him, we &s;hould have had enow pitiful Schollars that would have maintain'd there was never any &s;uch thing. Be|ing once in a Coach with an Im|pertinent Lady, under&s;tanding that I was a <HI>French</HI> Man, &s;he
<PB REF="10"> would not believe that they &s;poke in <HI>France</HI> any other Language than hers, which &s;he thought to be the Language of the whole World. Good God! how ma|ny People are there, who be|lieving them&s;elves to be very witty, are altogether like this Woman? If not in this very par|ticular, yet in &s;everal other things. We have taken for Fa|bles what the Poets or the An|cients have told us of the fir&s;t Inhabitants of the World. That they liv'd after the manner of Bea&s;ts, without Commonwealths, without Laws, naked, and feed|ing upon Acorns, and what the Earth produc'd, without any o|ther
<PB REF="11"> preparation than that of Nature. Yet they who return from <HI>America,</HI> tell us that they meet with &s;uch People there at this day, and that that part of the World is &s;till in its In|fancy. Nay though our own Hemi&s;phear be &s;o Polite, yet there are &s;ome Cantons di&s;co|ver'd, where the Men have only the outward &s;hape of Men: Wit|ne&s;s the Savage, which, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sloskoski</HI> a Canon of <HI>Cracovia,</HI> told me at <HI>Padua,</HI> he &s;aw in his own Country, and which had been brought from the Mountains that &s;eparate <HI>Po|land</HI> from <HI>Hungary.</HI> He was all over Hair, &s;poke not at all,
<PB REF="11"> but made a &s;ign for his Victu|als, by barking like a Dog; he hid him&s;elf up in a Corner, a|&s;ham'd to be &s;een of Men; he refus'd all manner of Cloaths which they brought him, and the Bread and Meat which they offered him bak'd and boil'd; on|ly fed upon raw Fle&s;h and Pro|vender like a Bea&s;t: For the ruggedne&s;s of tho&s;e uninhabited Mountains hindring People of our Conditions to have any Con|ver&s;e or Commerce in tho&s;e Parts, pre&s;erves tho&s;e Savages in their purely natural E&s;tate; in like manner as the va&s;t extent of the Ocean had kept the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> in their Primitive &s;implicity.
<PB REF="12"> Now becau&s;e there was not any Author, who had inform'd the <HI>Polonians</HI> that there were Sa|vages &s;o near them, had they any rea&s;on to give the Lye to tho&s;e, who having travell'd thi|ther, either out of Curio&s;ity, or by accident, &s;hould have a&s;&s;ur'd them that it was &s;o, unle&s;s they had brought one of tho&s;e Savages along with them? which howe|ver it was more ea&s;ie for them to do than to bring a <HI>Heliopo|litan</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI> For of things which we do not &s;ee, we know nothing but by the Report of others. Now Men have not re|ported to us all things for want of having been upon the Places;
<PB REF="12"> and the Rea&s;on why they do not travel thither, is either want of Courage or Curio&s;ity. Now that other People, be&s;ides tho&s;e of whom Hi&s;tory &s;peaks, have tran&s;ported them&s;elves from one Country to another, there is no Que&s;tion to be made: Witne&s;s tho&s;e, who in the Times of the fir&s;t <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> e&s;caped out of that part of <HI>Syria,</HI> where they inhabited, into <HI>Africa,</HI> where they Erected a Pillar, which was found &s;everal Ages after with this In&s;cription,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Procop. ci|ted by <HI>Ma|chiavel.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nos Mauru&s;ii qui fugimus &agrave; facie Jo|&s;ue Latronis, filii Nave.</HI> 'Tis very well known, that we
<PB REF="13"> have but a very &s;mall part of the Ancient Authors, and that tho&s;e which have been pre&s;erv'd to us are very much maim'd. Had we all of them entire, we &s;hould not be &s;uch admirers of what appears to us &s;o &s;trange or new by rea&s;on of our Ignorance only. Perhaps we might there have found out the Tran&s;migra|tion of this Solary Colony, whe|ther the Incredulous might ea&s;ily go, &s;ince we do not here pretend to undertake the fanta&s;tick Tra|vels of <HI>Begerac de Cyrano.</HI> As to what remains, &s;ince I relate nothing which is impo&s;&s;ible or miraculous, or that may render my Relation incredulous, it
<PB REF="13"> &s;ignifies little to call in que&s;tion the Matter of Fact, while the po&s;&s;ibility of the thing is acknow|ledg'd; and that leaving to every one the liberty to believe as they plea&s;e, they do not deprive me of that freedom which <HI>Plato</HI> had to propo&s;e the Idea of a Republick after his manner.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> As for the Pa&s;&s;age where I &s;ay that I heard People &s;peak|ing Greek litteral behind a Wall, they exclaim'd it is impo&s;&s;ible; but if they read with attention all the Relation, which in two different Pa&s;&s;ages &s;ays well enough for &s;atisfying our Admirer, and I do not like Re|petitions.</P>
<PB REF="14">
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> They &s;ay that I have not given an exact Relation of my return. To which I an&s;wer, that being weari'd with long Travelling, I thought it &s;ufficient to &s;et down the mo&s;t Remarkable things till I recover'd <HI>Turky.</HI> And as for what concerns <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> I have not &s;aid any more concerning them going thither than coming back; tho' I have made very exact De&s;crip|tions of them too, as well as of <HI>Ger|many, Switzerland, Holland, Greece</HI> and other Countries, de|&s;crib'd &s;o many times by other Pens, and as well known to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf. However Courteous Reader, if
<PB REF="14"> it be my good hap to under&s;tand that this E&s;&s;ay finds a favoura|ble acceptance, I may ob&s;erve the Promi&s;e which I have made you at the end of my Relation, by giving you the whole of my Adventures, together with the knowledge of all the Corners of the World, where I have been, as exactly as it is po&s;&s;ible to be done.</P>

<P>SO glorious is the Beauty of the Sun, and the Sphere of his Activity &s;o large, that of all tho&s;e People who adore the Creature to the Prejudice and Di&s;honour of the Creator, tho&s;e are to be deem'd le&s;s culpable, who pay their ho|mage to this, of all the Beings or Things of Heaven which we behold, the mo&s;t noble and beau|tiful.
<PB N="2" REF="16"> In &s;hort, his Characters have &s;uch a Corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e of the Deity, that were it not for that Revelation which informs us to the contrary, we could not be blam'd for adoring him as the God of this &s;ubluna|ry World. The Earth, which &s;eems to undergo a kind of Death at his departure, &s;eems to ri&s;e again at his return; while the Plants &s;ending forth their Flowers and Leaves, recloath her with their gaye&s;t Ornaments. The Birds renew their Amours; the very In&s;ects propagate; the more perfect Animals re&s;ume new vigor to engender their like: And, in a word, this com|mon Mother of all things grows young again, when he has fi|ni&s;hed his Southern Retrograda|tion, and comes back to us. Or,
<PB N="3" REF="16"> if it be he that &s;tands &s;till, when &s;he, according to the Or|der of her Revolution, oppo&s;es again&s;t him one or other of his Tropicks. For then it is that &s;he keeps open-hou&s;e for all her Inhabitants, by the Production of her Fruits, by the Favour of his lovely A&s;pect, from which nothing is conceal'd. For the va&s;t extent of his Beams renders him pre&s;ent over all the Univer&s;e, of which he penetrates the deep Aby&s;&s;es, there to produce Gold, Diamonds and Pearls. He is the inexhau&s;tible Fountain of that heat which enlivens us, and our real Fellow-parent in the Generation of our Children, if we may give credit to <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> He is lovely for his Beauty, to be adored for his Power, un|&s;peakable for his Effects, formi|dable
<PB N="4" REF="17"> for his Cha&s;ti&s;ements, which he &s;hall quickly feel, that &s;tares upon his lu&s;tre, with di&s;|re&s;pectul Eyes, as being dazl'd with the &s;ight; and if he con|tinue ob&s;tinate in his curio&s;ity, he fails not to find him&s;elf over|whelmed with the &s;pendor of his Glory. Now if all the&s;e Attributes will not &s;erve to ex|cu&s;e People that want the light of the Sun of Ju&s;tice, and that to be <HI>only</HI> a more &s;pecifick Cha|racter of the Divinity, we may add in their favour, That he is only &s;ingle; for which rea&s;on it was that the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd him <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, by a name excluding Multitude. The <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> nam'd him <HI>Adad,</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>One,</HI> and acknowledged him for the chief|e&s;t of the Gods, together with the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who called him by
<PB N="5" REF="17"> another name, which &s;ignifies in their Language, <HI>He in whom re|&s;ides the Soveraignty of Command.</HI> If <HI>Pliny</HI> his admirer did not adore him, he deem'd him wor|thy the Adoration of the Peo|ple, which the Inhabitants of the Fortunate I&s;lands never re|fus'd him. The <HI>Ma&s;&s;agetes</HI> ac|knowledge no other Deity but him. Al&s;o at this day we find in <HI>China</HI> a Temple dedicated to the Atoms of the Sun, who&s;e Palace is thought to be the Pa|radi&s;e of that People. All the Heathen upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ma|labar</HI> pay him homage, as al&s;o &s;ome part of the <HI>Jappons,</HI> and the <HI>Great Tartars,</HI> as we are told by &s;everal Geographers. For my own part, in truth, I never ob&s;erv'd any &s;uch &s;ort of Wor&s;hip in all that va&s;t extent
<PB N="6" REF="18"> of Territory, which I have tra|vell'd; only I met with one &s;mall corner inhabited by Phi|lo&s;ophers originally de&s;cended from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who mov'd by the&s;e, or &s;ome other more im|portant Reflections, were con|vinc'd not of his Divinity, but of his Superiority, and con&s;e|crated Holy-days; and ordain'd Ceremonies, wherein they ac|knowledge the Benefits which they receive by his Influences.

<PB N="7" REF="18">
<P>In the third year of my Age, and the year of our Lord 1636. I was &s;ent by my Parents from a Country-hou&s;e upon the <HI>Saone</HI> two Leagues above <HI>Lyons,</HI> with my Governe&s;s in a Boat, which through the carele&s;sne&s;s of the Ma&s;ter, was over&s;et by another larger Ve&s;&s;el that was tow'd a|long the &s;ame River. I remem|ber I heard the confu&s;ed noi&s;e of Shrieks and crying-out, <HI>We are lo&s;t, we are lo&s;t;</HI> I ask'd what was the matter? they made an|&s;wer, That they believed me to be the Cau&s;e of their di&s;a&s;ter, while the Boat-men &s;tood ga|zing to &s;ee me play in the Wa|ter. At length I lo&s;t my &s;en&s;es, I know not how. But no &s;ooner recovering my &s;elf, I &s;aw a Lady floating upon the Water, that with a lamentable voice called
<PB N="8" REF="19"> me by name; whereupon I cal|led to her and others whom I &s;aw peri&s;hing before my Eyes, to do as I did: For I fan&s;ied my &s;elf holding fa&s;t by the Piles of a wooden-Bridge, believing certainly that I could not be drowned &s;o long as I kept my hold. Methought al&s;o that &s;ome body went about to hinder me from &s;aving my &s;elf, by thru&s;ting away my Head with a Pole, which made me call him Cruel. Being thus lo&s;t a &s;econd time, I remain'd &s;encele&s;s, till I found my &s;elf in a Bed, where &s;ome People had laid me, who per|ceiving me from the &s;hoar about half a League lower, and be|lieving me to be a Bundle of Goods, came and fetch'd me out of the middle of the River, where they found me carried by
<PB N="9" REF="19"> the Stream upon a Bavin of Vine-Twigs. About two hours after the Boat was &s;unk, where|in were fourteen Per&s;ons all un|fortunately drown'd. From that time forward, being at the di&s;|po&s;al of tho&s;e to whom I was beholding for my life, I rowl'd from School to School, learn|ing Greek, Latin, and Poetry, with whatever be&s;ides the Cir|cle of the Sciences contains, till I was fourteen years of age; at what time being fallen into the hands of a &s;ort of Per&s;ons, who have the &s;ubtilty to in&s;inu|ate them&s;elves into the &s;imple Minds of Youth, and to make what impre&s;&s;ion they plea&s;e there|in, I &s;uffer'd my &s;elf to be led by their per&s;wa&s;ions to follow their Maxims. I remain'd in their So|ciety travelling from City to
<PB N="10" REF="20"> City, from Country to Country, till I was four and twenty years of Age; at what time finding my &s;elf at <HI>Rome</HI> in full lei&s;ure to examine the Sciences, which I thought I had acquir'd, I found by my &s;elf, that I knew nothing becau&s;e I had been ill taught: Therefore I tran&s;lated my &s;elf from the <HI>Lycaeum</HI> to the <HI>Portico,</HI> to the end I might give my &s;elf wholly up to the Study of Mo|rality, till the Reflections which I made upon the &s;everal Objects that pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my Sen&s;es, furni&s;h'd me with other Principles, that made me apply my &s;elf to the &s;tudy of Philo&s;o|phy and Phy&s;ick, with a greater &s;atisfaction than before.</P>
<P>During this lei&s;ure of mine, I open'd my Eyes to ob&s;erve the Cheats that had been put upon
<PB N="11" REF="20"> me, and bethought my &s;elf that it was my duty to abandon tho&s;e People, who&s;e ill lead Lives gave the Lye &s;o manife&s;t|ly to their Tenents. There ha|ving communicated my De&s;ign to <HI>Monthre&s;o,</HI> the hone&s;te&s;t and the mo&s;t Learned among the whole Tribe, he not only ap|prov'd it, but de&s;ir'd he might have the honour to accompany me in &s;o laudable an Enter|prize. With the&s;e Re&s;olutions we departed from the Capi|tal of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire the Twentieth of <HI>January</HI> 1663. by St. <HI>John Lateran</HI>'s Gate, and arrive at <HI>Naples</HI> by the 25th. where after we had &s;een the Curio&s;ities of <HI>Puzzuolo,</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI> tir'd with our Tra|vels through the Principal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> we re&s;olv'd to &s;ee
<PB N="12" REF="21"> the Varieties of other Coun|tries and Territories of the World. Thereupon re&s;olving to go aboard the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el that &s;et &s;ail for the <HI>Levant,</HI> we went to the Sea-&s;ide, where we met with <HI>Signor Hippolito,</HI> Cap|tain of the good Ship call'd the <HI>Hope;</HI> who under&s;tanding our de&s;ign, made us an obliging Proffer of his Service, which we readily accepting, embark'd the fourth of <HI>February,</HI> with a Wind &s;o favourable, that in a &s;hort time we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Land, which by Sickne&s;s laying in my Cabin I &s;aw no more till we arriv'd at <HI>Porto Lione,</HI> where we again had a view of it the Fifteenth. Overjoy'd that I was &s;o near a Place which was formerly the Man&s;ion of all Hu|man Wi&s;dom, I &s;oon forgot the
<PB N="13" REF="21"> tire&s;ome hard&s;hips of the Sea. So &s;oon as I ca&s;t my Eyes upon the ancient <HI>Pyraeum,</HI> &s;o ill treat|ed by Time, that it does not pre&s;erve &s;o much as its Name, chang'd into that which it car|ries at pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on of the ill-&s;hap'd figure of a Lyon. In the &s;ame Place we hir'd Po&s;t-Hor&s;es to vi&s;it <HI>Athens,</HI> di&s;tant from the Port about five Miles. So &s;oon as I arriv'd there, I be|gan to look for the rugged Ruins of that Famous Piece of Antiquity. Wherein I found great A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the know|ledge of the Learned <HI>Demetri|us,</HI> to whom I was recommend|ed by his Friends at <HI>Venice.</HI> Nei|ther was my own Skill in the Greek unprofitable to me. For though the Vulgar Greek differs very little from that in the
<PB N="14" REF="22"> Schools, the Corruption of this is not &s;o great, but that it may be under&s;tood, when it is &s;po|ken according to the Pronuncia|tion of the Country. Be&s;ides that it is as common among Per&s;ons of Quality, as Latin among the <HI>Polonians.</HI> Moreo|ver, they told me, that there is no other Greek to &s;peak pro|perly than that. In regard that what is call'd Vulgar Greek is a kind of Pedlars French, which differs according to the &s;everal Juri&s;dictions of the Country: that it was the &s;ame in the time of <HI>Demo&s;thenes;</HI> that then, be|&s;ides the four Dialects mo&s;t known, there were &s;ome other in u&s;e among the Vulgar Peo|ple; but that the Orators in their publick Pleadings made u&s;e of the common Speech,
<PB N="15" REF="22"> which was under&s;tood by the ordinary &s;ort, although they did not &s;peak it; which they con|firm'd to me by the Letters of private Per&s;ons written at that time, and which were after|wards found in the Ruins of old Walls. Their Books al&s;o were written in that &s;ort of Greek, which we call for that Rea&s;on <HI>Literal,</HI> and which is the very &s;ame that the Preachers at this day make u&s;e of in their Sermons. In a word that Per|&s;on is deem'd to write and &s;peak be&s;t among them, who comes neare&s;t the Language of the Ancient Authors; which is at this day the only Standard of the Language, as the <HI>Paragon</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> in <HI>France</HI> in re&s;pect of the other Provin|ces, where though it be not
<PB N="16" REF="23"> &s;poken, yet it is under&s;tood by the meaner &s;ort. The Citadel or <HI>Acropolis</HI> &s;eated upon a Rock commands the City, and is &s;een at Sea. Being not permitted to go in I could &s;ee no more than the outward &s;ide of it; but my Friend told me that there was a noble Piece of Antiquity, <HI>viz.</HI> the Temple of <HI>Diana.</HI> How|ever all that we could meet with of the Ancient Ornaments of that City, built many Ages be|fore <HI>Rome</HI> was, only certain &s;mall Towers erected in honour of tho&s;e who had been Victors in the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games, and &s;ome Portico's of ruin'd Tem|ples; among which there is one which re&s;embles that of <HI>Virile Fortune,</HI> which is now the <HI>E|gyptian</HI> St. <HI>Mary's</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> up|on the Banks of <HI>Tiber,</HI> in the
<PB N="17" REF="23"> Fle&s;h-market. They &s;hew'd me al&s;o a certain piece of carv'd Work, repre&s;enting <HI>Diana</HI> in her hunting Habit, attended in a Wood by her Nymphs. It was a wonderful Piece of Work|man&s;hip, and the In&s;cription gave us to under&s;tand, that it was wrought by the hand of <HI>Phidias,</HI> having been digg'd, but a little before we came thi|ther, out of the Ruins of the <HI>Areopagus;</HI> which does not now &s;tand within the compa&s;s of the City, that is now reduc'd with|in a le&s;&s;er compa&s;s. They al&s;o &s;hew'd me the place of the Tem|ple or Altar Erected to the un|known God. Several Statues are digg'd up out of the Earth every day, of which not one that I have &s;een comes near to tho&s;e of <HI>Italy.</HI> Thereupon be|ing
<PB N="18" REF="24"> amaz'd to &s;ee &s;o few Signs of its ancient Splendor, they made me an&s;wer, that I might &s;ee them in other Places, whi|ther the War had tran&s;planted them, or el&s;e Barter in Traffick. Indeed there was one Piece which I &s;aw the la&s;t time I was at <HI>Venice,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Sig|nor Michele Peruli,</HI> an <HI>Athenian</HI> Merchant, which had been &s;ent him as a Pre&s;ent, repre&s;enting in <HI>Ba&s;s Relief,</HI> a young man &s;tark naked, holding a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or el&s;e a Horn-Owlet, for the word &s;ignifies the &s;ame.</NOTE> Jack-daw in his Right hand. The bot|om of the Sculpture was adorn'd with a Palm-tree, upon the Trunk of which a certain kind of <HI>Beetle</HI> was engrav'd in a creeping Po|&s;ture. The Corni&s;h comes forth as far as the Statue, and is rai&s;ed
<PB N="19" REF="24"> by two borders, between which at the Top the&s;e words are to be read in Greek Letters, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, which &s;ome will therefore have to be the Son of the Great <HI>Demo&s;the|nes.</HI> The Piece is good from the Belly downward; but the Head is not very extraordinary, and the left hand is broke off. Every Body knows that the Sta|tue of <HI>Venus</HI> which formerly &s;tood upon <HI>Mount Pincius</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and is now to be &s;een in the Galleries of <HI>Florence,</HI> leave being given to the Grand Duke by the pre&s;ent Pope to remove it thither, was the Work of an <HI>Athe|nian,</HI> who&s;e name is en|grav'd at the bottom of the Statue, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. <HI>Kleome|nes
<PB N="20" REF="25"> the Son of Apollodorus an Athenian made this.</HI> A favour which the Dukes Predece&s;&s;ors could ne'er obtain, though from Popes of the &s;ame Family.

The&s;e Olive Trees en|compa&s;s it round, and are the chief Revenue of the <HI>Athenians.</HI> Their other Fruits are very Ex|cellent, and it may be the be&s;t in the World. But as for the Inhabitants they are no le&s;s na|turally Witty and Ingenious than ever; &s;o that if they
<PB N="21" REF="25"> were but well manur'd by Edu|cation, they would prove as Good Poets, Orators, Philo&s;o|phers, Statuaries or other Ar|ti&s;ts whatever, as ever were known at the time when it flou|ri&s;h'd in its highe&s;t Splendour. The Turks have the &s;ame re|&s;pect for them as the <HI>Romans</HI> had; who &s;uffer them to live according to their own Laws, and to be govern'd by their own Magi&s;trates, for the <HI>Grand Sig|nior</HI> is contented only with &s;end|ing thither one of his Favourite Eunuchs, who receives the Duty impos'd, without farther con|cerning him&s;elf with their Af|fairs; be&s;ides that his Garri&s;on is very incon&s;iderable. The Bi&s;hop is Judge of the Diffe|rences between the Dioce&s;ans, who generally &s;ubmit to his De|termination
<PB N="22" REF="26"> for fear of Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Cen&s;ures. They trade into <HI>Italy</HI> with their Commodi|ties, for which they receive in exchange Cloth, and all manner of Iron Tools. Their Women are hand&s;ome, and richly clad in their Garments embroider'd with Gold down to their very Shooes, which their Husbands, though poor, willingly let them have, for fear of a greater mi&s;|chief. The Citizens of Quality wear a long black robe with &s;hort Sleeves; but their Prie&s;ts are habited much like the Mini|&s;ters of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, on|ly the Sleeve is not gathered in|to Pleats: In the City they al|ways wear upon their Heads a round Cap; but in the Country a flat Hat; which they call an <HI>I&s;chiodon,</HI> becau&s;e it covers them
<PB N="23" REF="26"> from the Sun; their Beds are Quilts laid down on the Sop&s;a, but &s;ome of them are furni&s;h'd after our own fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>They believe the pre&s;ence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Sacrament; though the mo&s;t Learned among them have acknowledg'd to me, that the Fathers never under|&s;tood what <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI> meant. They &s;ay moreover that Chri&s;t is not there pre&s;ent in that manner which the <HI>Latins</HI> hold, when the Prie&s;t pronoun|ces the&s;e Words, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. <HI>This is my Body;</HI> which they affirm to be purely Hi&s;torical, but by virtue of the Prayer when he &s;ays, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. <HI>Make this Bread the worthy Body of Chri&s;t.</HI> I ob&s;erv'd that they ne|ver kneel'd before the Sacra|ment,
<PB N="24" REF="27"> but only bow'd with their Shoulders to the Bread, as well before as after Con&s;ecrati|on. The Liturgy being ended, the Prie&s;t invites the People to the Communion, if no body come, he eats the remainder upon a Table which &s;tands at the &s;ide of the North Door.</P>
<P>As for the Sick, they commu|nicate of the Bread and Wine Con&s;ecrated by the Bi&s;hop upon <HI>Maundy Thur&s;day</HI> for the whole year. To which purpo&s;e they keep the Bread &s;teep'd in the Wine, by the &s;ide of the Altar in a Cup-board without Light. I ask'd them, whither the Sa|crament &s;o pre&s;erv'd, did not putrifie; but they a&s;&s;ur'd me, it did not.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops Miter is not cloven, but round, and all be&s;et

<P>They never &s;tay till they are &s;ick to receive the Sacrament of Extream Unction; but they re|ceive it all every year in the ho|ly Week, after this manner: Two Archbi&s;hops ble&s;s the Oil; afterwards the Archbi&s;hop of the Church being &s;eated in his Chair, and five or &s;ix Prie&s;ts in theirs, the People pre&s;ent them&s;elves to be anointed, fir&s;t by the Prelate, who holding a Wax Candle in his hand, dips the Cotten in the holy Oil, and then anoints the Forhead,
<PB N="26" REF="28"> the Face, and Palm of the Hand; after which the &s;ame Per&s;on goes to the other Prie&s;ts who do the &s;ame. They pray for the dead, who&s;e Souls they believe remain in this World in expectation of the General day of Judgment; not admitting any parcicular Judgment.</P>
<P>They frequently perfume with Frankincen&s;e in their Ceremo|nies, which are very decent, and fill the Soul with a &s;en&s;ible Devotion. I ask'd them the rea&s;on why they made &s;uch fre|quent u&s;e of their Perfumes; to which they an&s;wer'd, That it was to admoni&s;h the People to &s;end up their Prayers with the Perfume, which a&s;cends toward Heaven. As to what remains, the Ea&s;tern Church glories in its Priority, which they a&s;&s;ume
<PB N="27" REF="28"> to them&s;elves, and which is no more than Truth; neither do the <HI>Latins</HI> di&s;pute the Point of Elder&s;hip. That which &s;ur|priz'd me was this, that they &s;hould pre&s;erve them&s;elves un|der the Tyranny of the <HI>Maho|metans,</HI> who neither by their oppre&s;&s;ive Impo&s;itions, nor fair Promi&s;es, could ever oblige the Ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians to change the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> for the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> To which purpo&s;e I will impart to the Reader two Remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages, that happen'd about &s;ix years &s;ince; the one at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> that befel a young man between &s;eventeen and eighteen years of Age, who&s;e Name was <HI>Anthony,</HI> Learned for his Age in the Turki&s;h Language above a|ny, belov'd by every one for his Excellent Qualities, even of
<PB N="28" REF="29"> the Turks them&s;elves, who for that rea&s;on would fain have brought him over to the <HI>Maho|metan</HI> Religion. To which purpo&s;e they &s;hew'd him a lit|tle Note to read, wherein were written, in <HI>Arabian,</HI> the&s;e words, <HI>I believe in God, and in Maho|met his Apo&s;tle.</HI> So &s;oon as he had read it, they &s;aluted him as one of their Brethren, &s;aying he was a Turk, as having made a Profe&s;&s;ion of their Religion by reading that Note. He deny'd it; upon which they carried him before a Judge who condemn'd him. From thence they hal'd him to the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> who upon the Te&s;timony of tho&s;e wicked People who had &s;o &s;ur|priz'd him, condemn'd him al&s;o to make profe&s;&s;ion of the Law, as being thereto oblig'd by his
<PB N="29" REF="29"> reading. Upon his refu&s;al they carried him to Pri&s;on, where for thirty days he endured mo&s;t horrible torments; of which one among the re&s;t was the thru&s;ting of &s;harp Reeds be|tween the Fle&s;h and the Nails of his Fingers: After which he had his Head cut off, which the Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> bought of the Executioner as a precious Relique.</P>
<P>The other, named <HI>Diamanti,</HI> aged about thirty years, and of a charming Beauty, was rowing naked in a Boat upon a River of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> with certain <HI>Turks,</HI> who mov'd with com|pa&s;&s;ion that &s;o lovely a Man &s;hould peri&s;h for want of em|bracing their Religion, put a white Turbant upon his Head. Which done, he was u&s;ed with
<PB N="30" REF="30"> the &s;ame &s;everity as <HI>Anthony</HI> was, after he had refu&s;ed the chiefe&s;t Preferments in the Empire. But a <HI>Jacobin</HI> Monk, who was there at the &s;ame time, renouncing his Chri&s;tianity, was the occa&s;ion of their recovering by his Apo&s;ta|cy, what they had lo&s;t by the generous Con&s;tancy of <HI>Diaman|ti.</HI> I could give a more ample De&s;cription of the Religion of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> but having done it in another place, I &s;hall not &s;tudy to enlarge this Volume.</P>
<P>Neither was <HI>Demetrius</HI> con|tent to &s;hew me what was with|in the City, but extending his kindne&s;s, re&s;olv'd to let me &s;ee what was without. To which purpo&s;e he invited me to take a walk with him to the Coun|try-hou&s;e of one <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> his particular Friend, di&s;tant about
<PB N="31" REF="30"> ten miles; which we re&s;olv'd to walk according to the cu&s;tom of the Country. We &s;et out by day-break, and with great delight cro&s;s'd over &s;everal de|licious Gardens and Fields plant|ed with Olive-trees, promi&s;ing our &s;elves a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Jour|ney, perceiving the Sun to ri&s;e upon the Lilies whitene&s;s. But contrary to the Maxim of the Weather-wi&s;e we were deceived. For a black Cloud behind us be|ing driven forward by a We&s;t wind, &s;oon got under the Sun, and deprived us of the &s;ight of that noble Planet. Pre&s;ently the Sky became &s;o dark that we could hardly di&s;cern one ano|ther, which were the fore-run|ners of a mo&s;t dreadful Thun|der; which, however, did not terrifie me &s;o much as the Rain
<PB N="32" REF="31"> that followed did me mi&s;chief. For be&s;ides that continuing all that day, it &s;oak'd through my Shirt to my very Skin; the Fat Soil of the Fields through which we were to pa&s;s to get the neare&s;t way, being di&s;&s;olv'd, we &s;unk in the Mud up to our very Knees, &s;o that we were forc'd every &s;tep we took to pull out our Legs with our Hands. This &s;ame Combat with the bad Weather and wor&s;e Way, tired me &s;o much, that I was forced to make a &s;top. Ne|verthele&s;s I encourag'd <HI>Monthre|&s;or</HI> to follow <HI>Demetrius;</HI> I bid them al&s;o drink and be merry, and take no notice of my indi&s;|po&s;ition, telling them withal, That after I had re&s;ted my &s;elf upon the de&s;cent of a Turfy Bank, where I was laid down
<PB N="33" REF="31"> through meer faintne&s;s, I would endeavour to overtake them the next day. After that, falling in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;leep, I knew not what became of them, till wak'd with the noi&s;e, I perceiv'd them upon two Camels followed by a Countryman who led a third, which carried me to the Friends Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> treated us with that magnificence, that it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee he had been adver|ti&s;ed of our coming. But having lo&s;t all my Strength and Spirits, not all the Delicacy of his Vi|ands could force my langui&s;hing Appetite; &s;o that the good Wine was all the Refre&s;hment I could take that Evening. How|ever I took &s;ome plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Company fall on &s;o heartily, &s;ometimes ca&s;ting my Eyes upon
<PB N="34" REF="32"> a Lady that &s;ate over-again&s;t me, young, hand&s;ome, and plump, yet one that eat no more than my &s;elf; which I wondered at the more, becau&s;e I could not &s;ee any rea&s;on &s;he had to be &s;o tender-&s;tomach'd, I ob&s;erv'd al|&s;o, that &s;he would be &s;till &s;taring upon me, and could read in her Eyes that I was not a per&s;on out of her Favour. However, Mo|de&s;ty would not permit me to inform my &s;elf any farther, and my Indi&s;po&s;ition was Excu&s;e e|nough for me to take leave of the Company, that I might re|pair the Lo&s;&s;es of my Strength by the Refre&s;hment of a good Bed. After a &s;hort Nap, I ob|&s;erv'd <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> earne&s;tly pee|ping through the crevice of a Door that lead out of my Cham|ber into another, and finding
<PB N="35" REF="32"> by my &s;tirring, that I was awake, he came to me, and made me put my Head out of Bed, and look through the &s;ame chink in|to the next Chamber, where I &s;aw a young man performing the Duty of a Chambermaid to the young Lady: But neither of us knew what the meaning of it was; thereupon I fell a&s;leep again, and <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> went to bed. About midnight I was awaked again by the hard tread|ing of &s;ome body in the Cham|ber; at what time, putting by the Curtain of the Bed, which was of Cloth of Gold, I was &s;trangely &s;urprized to &s;ee the &s;ame young man in his Shirt, with a Scimiter drawn in his right Hand, and his Eyes &s;park|ling like the light that glitter'd out of the Lanthorn which he
<PB N="36" REF="33"> held in his left, with my own Night-cap. Nor was I le&s;s ter|rified to &s;ee him in that po|&s;ture making toward <HI>Monthre|&s;or</HI>'s Bed; which however, he pre&s;ently left to come to mine; and &s;o &s;oon as he perceived my bare Head, which I thru&s;t out from between the Curtains to &s;ee what was the matter; <HI>Oh! is it you,</HI> cry'd he? The noi&s;e which he made, wakned my Companion, and I at the &s;ame time leap'd out of my Bed &s;tark naked as I was, having lain af|ter the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, the bet|ter to ea&s;e my &s;elf, &s;natch'd up my Cloak and wound it about my Arm to &s;end off the Blows which the enraged young Fellow laid on without mercy. By this <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> coming to my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, cla&s;p'd the young man
<PB N="37" REF="33"> about both his Arms, and &s;topp'd his Fury, which was as much as he could do, in regard we had both left our Swords in the place where we &s;upp'd. Pre|&s;ently after the Lady coming out of her Chamber, made a hideous out-cry which rai&s;ed all the Hou&s;e, and brought them into the Room; and <HI>Demetrius</HI> without any more to do, took my part. At which the Ag|gre&s;&s;or began to vomit forth a|gain&s;t me all the Reproaches and ill Language that his Pa&s;|&s;ion could invent, out of a fal&s;e belief, that I had at|tempted the Honour of his Si|&s;ter, &s;hews my Cap to <HI>Constan|tine,</HI> as being the mo&s;t proper Judge of the Tre&s;pa&s;s which was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been com|mitted in his Hou&s;e; and adds,
<PB N="38" REF="34"> That having heard a noi&s;e in her Chamber, he ha&s;tned thither and found what I wanted, lying at her Beds feet. However, though the Pre&s;umption were very rational, <HI>Demetrius</HI> had a better opinion of me, as well in re&s;pect of his experience of my Conver&s;ation, and the Re|commendations of his Friends in my behalf, and &s;tifly maintain'd that I was a Per&s;on that &s;corn'd &s;uch a di&s;honourable Action. On the other &s;ide, the Lady who had thrown her &s;elf be|tween her Brother and me, to &s;top his Fury, conjured him by her own Honour, not to be|lieve any thing that might tend to her Scandal; alledging, that the Cap might have been carried into the Chamber by &s;ome un|thought-of Accident. This <HI>Con|stantine</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="34"> confirm'd, a&s;&s;uring the Company, That the Rats, of which the Hou&s;e was full for want of Cats, the &s;ight of which he could not endure, did often play him &s;uch Tricks, many times carrying away his Stock|ings and other Clothes, &s;ome|times into one Corner, &s;ome|times into another, and that &s;o my Cap might have fallen ac|cidentally from my Head, and have been carried where the young man found it; therefore he de&s;ired <HI>La&s;caris</HI> to pacifie his Wrath, and me to pardon his zealous Fury in his Si&s;ter's behalf. Thereupon, every one acquie&s;cing in his Judgment, they all return'd to their Beds. By break of day my Enemy gave me another vi&s;it, not like a Mad-man, but with a &s;erene
<PB N="40" REF="35"> and &s;miling Countenance, crav'd my Excu&s;e for the Tran&s;ports of his Rage; and &s;o &s;aying, he brought me one of his own Shooes that a Rat had likewi&s;e carried away, all gnaw'd and Vermin-eaten as it was: And this, added he, puts me out of doubt of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Conje|cture. After that he made me privy to his Si&s;ter's Concerns, and his de&s;ign to carry her pri|vately out of the way, that he might relea&s;e her from the im|portunate Addre&s;&s;es of the Eunuch Governour of <HI>Athens,</HI> who was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her, but who&s;e vain and impotent Care&s;&s;es were loath|&s;ome to her.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> would fain have had me travelled farther up in|to the Country; but in regard I
<PB N="41" REF="35"> had &s;een enough to judge of the Nature of the re&s;t by what I had &s;een already, that is to &s;ay, That it was enriched with ex|cellent Fruits, abounding in Corn and Oil, without any de|ficiency of <HI>Bacchus</HI>'s Liquor, I determined to return to the City, where finding my Land|lord <HI>Epiphanes</HI> tied Legs and Feet by the Fetters of that Di|&s;temper which proceeds from Wine and good Chear, where men indulge their Appetites to exce&s;s, I relieved him with my <HI>Antipodagricon,</HI> or Antidote a|gain&s;t the Gout; and under|&s;tanding that our Ve&s;&s;el was ready to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> tho' there &s;till remained many things for me to have &s;een in this &s;o highly renowned Pro|vince of <HI>Greece;</HI> I rather cho&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="36"> to deferr the Satisfaction of my Curio&s;ity till my Return, than to lo&s;e the opportunity of our Ve&s;&s;el; &s;o that we embark'd the 25th. New-&s;tile, and the 15th. Old-&s;tile, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> re|tain as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce were we got clear of the Road, but my u&s;ual Di&s;tem|per &s;eized me, which obliged me to keep my Cabin, where I lay ill till we came to <HI>Byzan|tium,</HI> where we arrived the 4th. of <HI>March.</HI> Upon our landing, a <HI>French</HI> Slave that &s;tood upon the Key, offered to conduct us to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Signior Lorenzo,</HI> to whom I had Letters to deli|ver; by the way we met with two <HI>Turks,</HI> one of which took off my Hat, and with his Foot to&s;&s;ed it up into the Air, like a Foot-ball, diverting him&s;elf and
<PB N="43" REF="36"> his Companion for &s;ome time with his rude Sport, laughing and houting all the while. The rea|&s;on was, as our Guide told us, becau&s;e tho&s;e &s;ort of People bear an inveterate hatred to our Habits, which they look upon to be very paltry and ridiculous, neverthele&s;s we think them to be very graceful, and account our &s;elves the wi&s;e&s;t People in the World.</P>
<P>This Capital City of the <HI>Ot|toman</HI> Empire having been &s;e|veral times de&s;cribed by other Travellers who have been very exact in their relations, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of it, only that af|ter I had &s;atisfied my &s;elf with the &s;ight of the Hippodrome, and &s;everal other the mo&s;t re|markable parts of it, I departed thence the 7th. of <HI>March,</HI> ha|ving
<PB N="44" REF="37"> the opportunity of a Ve&s;|&s;el, which carried me through the Euxine Sea to <HI>Lonati,</HI> where we arrived the 17th. my de&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>Tartary,</HI> of which Coun|try there has been &s;o little &s;aid, cau&s;ing me to make choice of that Pa&s;&s;age. However, not ha|ving any information that might a&s;&s;i&s;t me to find out the mo&s;t commodious and &s;afe&s;t way to &s;teer my Travels, I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to frequent the Coffee-Hou&s;es, where I had the good luck to meet with <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> a young man, well-featur'd, and infinitely civil, the Son of a rich Merchant of <HI>Jamina</HI> in <HI>Epirus,</HI> famous for the Birth of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> and well &s;tored with Learning. This Per&s;on was al&s;o a Traveller for his plea&s;ure, and with the &s;ame de&s;ign that we had, which
<PB N="45" REF="37"> was to &s;ee the mo&s;t remote Pla|ces, rarely frequented, and of which the Relations are hitherto very imperfect. He under&s;tood the Turki&s;h perfectly well, but excell'd in the Litteral Greek. Seeing therefore that I had a &s;mattering of both the Lan|guages, and that our humours corre&s;ponded, he was de&s;irous to make a Third in our Socie|ty. Thereupon we concluded to range the remainder of Tur|ky, being inform'd that we &s;hould find Ve&s;&s;els at <HI>Santa Ma|ria,</HI> which would tran&s;port us into <HI>Tartary</HI> through the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and that we might take that way without any danger, having a Janizary to attend us, with whom we might agree for the whole expence of the Jour|ney. With the&s;e In&s;tructions
<PB N="46" REF="38"> we pitch'd upon a Rough hewn Blade, who undertook to conduct us for Twenty five Crowns a Head, for who&s;e Fi|delity, be&s;ides that he lookt like an hone&s;t &s;tout fellow, a Mer|chant of <HI>Ari&s;tides's</HI> Acquaintance engag'd. A Crown is a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Real, which Money, as well as that of the <HI>German</HI> Empire and <HI>Holland,</HI> goes through all Turky with <HI>Venetian</HI> Sequins, to the great advantage of Travellers; upon every Sequin you get five Shillings, upon every Real one Shilling.</P>
<P>Upon the Twentieth of <HI>March</HI> we got a Hor&s;e-back, the Weather being very fair, and &s;o continuing till the Thirti|eth, at what time we got to <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> by ea&s;ie Journeys, &s;etting up our Tents in tho&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="38"> places which &s;eem'd to us mo&s;t convenient; and yet for all that we travell'd at lea&s;t Twelve Leagues a day. All that Coun|try which comprehends <HI>Mingre|lia</HI> and <HI>Georgia,</HI> is &s;ufficiently beautiful, but ill peopled and con&s;equently wor&s;e manur'd. The <HI>Georgians</HI> are acompted Hereticks by the Greeks, though they ob&s;erve their Ceremonies. The difference between them con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in this, that they will not acknowledge the Holy Virgin to be the Mother of God; alleadging that God could have no Mother: How|ever though they blame the Greeks for being of a contrary Opinion, yet they do not for|bear to frequent their Churches in <HI>Italy,</HI> and prefer them before the <HI>Latins. Aristides</HI> and my
<PB N="48" REF="39"> &s;elf were pre&s;ent at their Cere|monies in the Pa&s;&s;ion Week, at what time <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> lay &s;ick of a Dy&s;entry; but by virtue of an infallible Cure which I brought with me from <HI>Rome</HI> he recover'd, and was in a Condi|tion to put to Sea, the Third of <HI>April,</HI> which we did with a fair Wind that brought us to <HI>Mora</HI> the Seventh. However we did not land there, by rea&s;on of the Pe&s;tilence that was very violent in that Place: Which was to me a grievous Affliction by rea|&s;on of the racking Pains which I endur'd upon the Sea, and which only going a&s;hore could relieve. Thereupon we were con&s;train'd to put out again in|to the open Sea, which being offended at our Return, began to murmur, and by and by all
<PB N="49" REF="39"> in a raging fury began to threa|ten the de&s;truction of our Ve&s;|&s;el, and &s;wallow us up in his Mounting Waves. Nor did the Storm cea&s;e till &s;ome hours after Night was &s;hut in; but then it became &s;o calm and &s;mooth that I felt &s;ome ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The next day being the Eighth I got upon the Deck, and de&s;crying Land with a &s;mall Town about three Miles di&s;tant from the Shore, I propos'd to our Friends, that we might be row'd a&s;hore in our Skiff, to which they agreed, and our Captain was no le&s;s willing, and in re&s;pect to <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> order'd the Seamen to carry our Luggage to the Town, which afterwards we found to be <HI>Sabatan.</HI> There we were curteou&s;ly receiv'd by the Inhabitants, who care&s;s'd us after an extraordinary manner,
<PB N="50" REF="40"> and without any hopes of Pro|fit, in regard there are no Inns in that place, as in <HI>France</HI> and other Countries of Europe; the Per&s;on that entertains you being &s;atisfi'd with having per|form'd a laudable Act of Ho&s;pi|tality. Happy was he that could have us; and therefore to plea&s;e more then one we divided our &s;elves. However though we lodg'd in &s;everal Hou&s;es, we kept together all day long. They al&s;o recommended to our Service a <HI>Tartarian,</HI> who having liv'd among the <HI>Franks</HI> at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> had learnt the <HI>Itali|an</HI> Language; and therefore finding him inclin'd to &s;erve us we accepted of him. And thus having recover'd our former health by re&s;t and good feed|ing, we &s;et forwards again the Eleventh, without any other de|&s;ign,
<PB N="51" REF="40"> than to travel at a venture in a Country that let us come where we would, we had what we aim'd at.</P>
<P>About a Mile from <HI>Sabatan</HI> we travell'd over a ri&s;ing Ground, from whence we might take a view of the Country; and after we had for &s;ome time lookt as far as we could &s;ee, we cho&s;e the South Ea&s;t, as &s;eeming the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, and &s;o march'd on with <HI>Caraman</HI> our <HI>Tartar</HI> be|fore us, carrying a Basket of Provi&s;ions, with a <HI>Parti&s;an</HI> in his hand, and his Bow and Ar|rows at his Back. We carry'd every one a Carbine in our hands, as well for &s;port as de|fence, two Pi&s;tols in our Pock|ets, and a Scimitar by our &s;ides; and as for our Coats and Bags of Linnen for change, we
<PB N="52" REF="41"> threw them upon a Hor&s;e which we had provided to &s;erve us in time of nece&s;&s;ity. Moreover <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> had one more atten|dant than any of the re&s;t; a &s;tout Ma&s;tiff, which he had bred up of a Whelp, fierce to all others but his Ma&s;ters Friends; and which his Ma&s;ter had arm'd with a &s;trange fan|ta&s;tical Cap of Steel to defend him from the Claws and Fangs of Wild Bea&s;ts, which cove|ring his head like the hollow half of a Pruen Stone, ended a little below his No&s;e, like the Horn of a Rinoceros, with a Point &s;o &s;harp to be able to pierce a Bufolo's Skin. This Dogs Name was <HI>Pamphagos,</HI> in plain <HI>Engli&s;h All-devour.</HI> And thus accouter'd and pro|vided we travell'd all that day till night without meeting any
<PB N="53" REF="41"> Living thing; nor was the night le&s;s tedious to us for want of a good lodging.</P>
<P>The Twelfth, &s;etting forward again betimes in the Morning, and we found by <HI>Caramans</HI> pace, that we had made a &s;hift to find the way to our Mouths in the Dark. But when we had made a farther Breach in his Basket at Noon, he began to out-&s;trip us &s;o fa&s;t that we were forc'd to order him to keep behind. Toward Even|ing we di&s;cover'd a Cottage made of Stone without Morter cover'd with Gra&s;s. Thereup|on we de&s;ir'd <HI>All-devour</HI> to o|pen his Mouth and &s;peak to the Cottage, believing that upon his &s;urly &s;ummons they that were within would make their appearance; but no an&s;wer be|ing return'd, we conjectur'd it
<PB N="54" REF="42"> to be as we found it, empty; and thereupon thought fit to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not knowing where to find a better Lodging. The re&s;t of the Evening we &s;pent in cutting Fern for our Bedding. The Wolves however being come, <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> &s;trook a light with his &s;teel and flint, to the end we might &s;up with more plea&s;ure by the light of a &s;mall Wax Candle; <HI>Caraman</HI> was extreamly pleas'd to &s;ee us feed like Hunters, in hopes that he &s;hould have nothing to car|ry next day; and truly there was but a very &s;mall Modicum left, which we re&s;erv'd with an equal proportion of Wine for breakfa&s;t. Thus after we had &s;upp'd we took our repo&s;e ve|ry &s;weetly under the Guard of <HI>All-devour,</HI> who kept Sentinel at the Door of the Cottage.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="42">
<P>The Thirteenth <HI>All-devour</HI> &s;tarted a Hare, which it was <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI>'s good fortune to kill. Pre&s;ently we got a good heap of Bru&s;h Wood together to roa&s;t our Veni&s;on. And af|ter we had din'd we agreed to|gether, that if any Misfortune &s;hould threaten us, the la&s;t li|ving &s;hould inherit all the Goods.</P>
<P>All this while the apprehen|&s;ion of wanting Victuals had put us quite out of conceit with the&s;e De&s;erts, at what time we di&s;cover'd about four Miles off a ri&s;ing Hillock, of which the White and Green put it into our heads that we &s;hould make a di&s;covery what it really was. Thereupon we made up to it, and the nearer we approach'd the Objects rendring them&s;elves more di&s;tinct, at length we per|ceiv'd
<PB N="56" REF="43"> them to be a knot of Shepherds Lodgings, who un|der&s;tanding by <HI>Caraman</HI> the Cau&s;e of our coming, fea&s;ted us in their Tents to the be&s;t of their Power: For their u&s;ual Dyet is Milk, Chee&s;e, Butter and Pul&s;e, &s;uch as the Earth naturally produces without la|bour. Some there are that eat Fle&s;h; but they are lookt upon as Savages and Brutes. They have al&s;o a &s;ort of Wheat which grows like their Pul&s;e without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Husbandry; but they make no Bread of it, no more than they make Wine of their Grapes. In a word, they live upon all the Productions of the Earth, which it affords them without any o|ther preparation than that of nature. Neverthele&s;s, as having the foreca&s;t of Bees and Emets,
<PB N="57" REF="43"> they make their Provi&s;ion in its proper Sea&s;ons again&s;t Win|ter.</P>
<P>As to their Stature, they are generally about four foot and a half high, but never exceed five. Their Faces are generally &s;quare, but well &s;hap'd, only that their No&s;es are generally flat: They are &s;trong and couragious; their Cloathing for the more carele&s;s &s;ort is only a Sheeps Skin; but the more neat and curious make u&s;e of the Skins of Hares, Martins, Foxes or Ty|gers, which they kill in Hunt|ing. Nor is the Habit of the Women much different from that of the Men; for they &s;ay that the Beard is a &s;ufficient di|&s;tinction between the two Sexes. They are faithful to their Hus|bands, equally &s;haring with them in their Cares and Pains,
<PB N="58" REF="44"> according to the practi&s;e of <HI>Hol|land.</HI> When they have a mind to eat, their Provi&s;ion is brought in an old <HI>Hart,</HI> or <HI>Elan</HI>'s Skin; which being &s;pread upon the Ground &s;erves in&s;tead of a Ta|ble, Napkin and Platter much like the Greeks and Turks; they &s;it down upon Cu&s;hions made of Sheep Skins with the Wooll on; every one takes what be&s;t plea&s;es his Palate. For they have Fruits of all &s;orts, fre&s;h in their Sea&s;on, and pre|&s;erv'd in Winter; Apples, Pears, Cherries, Figs, Grapes, Wheat, Milk, and Roots, which they pre&s;erve in Honey in&s;tead of Salt, of which they make no u&s;e at all; they begin their Meals with a large draught of Milk, and &s;o conclude them. After that, if they chance to be a drye, they quench their Thir&s;ts
<PB N="59" REF="44"> with the next fair Water they meet. They lye in their Cloaths upon Skins &s;pread upon the Ground, and cover them&s;elves with Skins of the &s;ame &s;ort: Which I find to be more con|venient than the Beds of <HI>Ger|many</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> where Feathers &s;erve for Bed and Co|verlet.</P>
<P>They are never &s;ick, and therefore Phy&s;ick is not known among them. They only dye of old Age, upon the utter ex|tinction of their Natural heat, which happens &s;ooner or later, according to the Compo&s;ition which they fir&s;t receiv'd in their Mothers Womb. I once askt a decrepid old Man, whether he were not afraid of Death? Who being &s;urpriz'd at the Novelty of a Que&s;tion never propos'd a|mong them, made an&s;wer, That
<PB N="60" REF="45"> there was nothing to be fear'd where there was nothing of E|vil. That he conceiv'd Death to be nothing el&s;e but a Ce&s;&s;ati|on from the Motions of Action and Thought: That all evil con&s;i&s;ted in the Thought, and therefore there could be no &s;uf|fering where there is a Ce&s;&s;ation of Thought. I could not but admire at &s;uch Philo&s;ophy as this in a Per&s;on &s;o Illiterate; for they are &s;o far from addicting them&s;elves to &s;tudy, that they have not any knowledge of Books. In the next place I caus'd him to be ask'd of what Religion he was? To which he made this Return, That he was a Shepherd by Profe&s;&s;ion; nor could I draw any other an&s;wer from him. They abide in the Places of which they make choice, &s;o long as their Flocks
<PB N="61" REF="45"> find any thing to feed upon. Afterwards they remove into o|ther Parts, under the Conduct of one who is their Chief. They were &s;o Civil, that perceiving we wanted a Tent, they pre|&s;ented us with one of their own; together with a Cart and four Cows to draw it, which be|&s;ides the &s;ervice that they did us, might al&s;o feed us with their Milk. Their Tents are made of white Skins, dre&s;t with the Hair on; which colour they make choice of above all others, to the end their Tents may be di&s;cern'd at a di&s;tance, which prevents others that have occa|&s;ion to change their &s;tations, to remove to a place already po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth we took leave of our Ho&s;ts, laden with Pro|vi&s;ions for Eight days, which
<PB N="62" REF="46"> they put into our Cart; for which we pre&s;ented them with &s;everal <HI>Italian</HI> Trifles, very ac|ceptable to them by rea&s;on of their Novelty.</P>
<P>From thence we went on &s;lowly, and by &s;hort Journeys, taking up our Lodging an hour before Night, which we &s;pent either in eating or &s;leeping, one of our Company always keep|ing watch in his Turn; not for fear of Robbers, or Barbarous &s;poilers of Pa&s;&s;engers; for there are no &s;uch U&s;ages among them, but for fear of the wild Bea&s;ts, which otherwi&s;e might have a&s;|&s;aulted our Per&s;ons, or de|vour'd our Cows, for who&s;e Pa&s;turage our Sentinel had in charge to provide, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of <HI>All-devour,</HI> We al|&s;o made a &s;top in the day time, as well to re&s;t our &s;elves, as to
<PB N="63" REF="46"> refre&s;h our &s;elves with a &s;hort Meal, which was generally by the &s;ide of a Fountain, which wanting of, we drank at the charge of our Cows.</P>
<P>The Twentieth we under|&s;tood by the heat of the Sun, that we were far di&s;tant from the North; which heat was &s;o violent, that the Reflection of it from a Rock upon our right hand, put <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> into a violent Fit of the Headach, who having at length met with a convenient Shade, under the favour of the Elbow of a Hillock, made bold to &s;it down upon certain Stones, which long time had loo&s;en'd and rowl'd down from the Rock; be&s;ides that our hour be|ing come, the conveniency of the Place invited us to take our Repa&s;t, provided we could meet with any Water. There|upon
<PB N="64" REF="47"> <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> and my &s;elf, leaving our &s;ick Friend to his Repo&s;e under the Guard of <HI>Car|raman,</HI> went to look out for &s;ome Water, judging by the na|ture of the Place, that we could not be far off from a Spring: Nor were we deceiv'd, for not far off, we di&s;covered a large Hind going to cool him&s;elf in a wide receptacle of &s;pring water, not unlike to that which proves the Spring of a wide River near the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> at the foot of <HI>Tourmagne</HI> at <HI>Nimes</HI> in <HI>Languedoc.</HI></P>
<P>The Bea&s;t was nothing &s;cared either at the &s;ight of us, or our Fire-arms; nor did we think it Humanity to injure our Benefa|ctre&s;s. But finding the Rock to open in that place, our Curio|&s;ity led us to enter the Hole; wherein about ten paces from
<PB N="65" REF="47"> the entrance, we found a &s;pa|cious Hall very convenient for us to take the benefit of the cool Air. The rocky part was &s;o odly contrived, that you would have taken it for the Workman|&s;hip of a Monk of <HI>Pic-Puz,</HI> had you been near <HI>Paris.</HI> The bottom of the Grotto was cleft into an A&s;cent, the fir&s;t &s;teps of which did not &s;eem very un|ea&s;ie. Thereupon our Curio&s;i|ty leading us further, <HI>Monthre|&s;or</HI> &s;trook a light, by vertue of which we pur&s;ued the A&s;cent for about half a quarter of an Hour with &s;ome difficulty, till at length we came to another Hall larger and fairer than that below. Thence we pa&s;&s;ed into a Gallery that led into &s;everal others, very much re&s;embling tho&s;e of <HI>Chinon;</HI> for that here as well as there, the moi&s;ture of
<PB N="66" REF="48"> the Earth &s;training it &s;elf through her Veins in &s;o many di&s;tinct, as it were, Springs of Water, tran&s;|forms it &s;elf into &s;o many Chry|&s;tal Pendants, &s;ticking and cru|&s;ted to the Wall, like &s;o many little Mirrours, in a concave and unequal form, not inferiour to the Ice flakes of <HI>Murrhan,</HI> which are poli&s;h'd at <HI>Venice.</HI> And thus Nature having, as it were in Sport, &s;hewn us what &s;he can do alone without the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Art, &s;eem'd to teach us the Original of Rivers: For &s;he permits the remainder of this matter, after &s;he has form'd the&s;e rare Pieces of Workman|&s;hip, to fall partly by way of Di|&s;tillation from the point of a con|fus'd multitude of Pyramids, hanging athwart this &s;o richly frettiz'd Ceiling, partly trickling from the glittering Concave up|on
<PB N="67" REF="48"> the Pavement that receives it; whence the whole conveys it &s;elf into &s;everal Channels to be thence conducted into larger Receptacles, &s;ituated at a di|&s;tance one from another, till it come to the la&s;t and large&s;t of all, whence it unfolds it &s;elf like a Napkin, which the violence of the Air opens as it hangs, till at length it de&s;cends in a kind of &s;mall Rain, colour'd by the Reflection of the Sun that &s;hoots in through the hole at the top, into a profound Aby&s;s, not to be beheld without Terror and Amazement. The&s;e Ob&s;ervati|ons put me out of doubt, that that &s;ame Water which I knew to be a rama&s;sment of di&s;tilled Drops, was the Water that ori|ginally enlarg'd the Receptacle fir&s;t mentioned, and to the Ri|ver that &s;prings from it. Whence
<PB N="68" REF="49"> I concluded that all other Springs have the &s;ame original; whe|ther it be, that the Air condens'd by Cold, di&s;&s;olve into moi&s;ture; or whether the Earth imbibe this Humour by filtration, or otherwi&s;e, as I &s;et forth in my new Sy&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy. And thus &s;atisfied with a &s;ight &s;o ex|traordinary, we return'd to <HI>Ari|&s;tides,</HI> to whom we imparted our Di&s;coveries; who thereup|on would needs have us carry our Dinner thither, to the end we might have the plea&s;ure of eating in &s;uch a delicious Ban|quetting hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The 21st. we had nothing but Plains on every &s;ide very rich in Pa&s;turage, which was the rea|&s;on that we met &s;everal Shep|herds who had left their Tents, where only Night requires their Attendance.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="49">
<P>The 23d. we arrived at the foot of a Mountain cover'd with Box, out of which the Lake called the Swan's Lake, di&s;char|ges it &s;elf through a hole about ten foot below the top, among the Boughs of a plea&s;ant Wood; where Nature has &s;o ordered the &s;loping of the Rock, that &s;ome|times the Water &s;pouts forth like &s;o many Waves, &s;ometimes &s;purts out like a Plume of Feathers, and &s;ometimes like an Agret; afterwards falling all of a &s;ud|den, like a Veil, through the &s;ides of a Demi-oval, eight Foot in Diameter, it throws it &s;elf into a neighbouring River, which in Summer is the de|light of the Shepherds that feed their Flocks in the Mea|dows which it waters. In this River while they wa&s;h their Sheep, they &s;port with their
<PB N="70" REF="50"> Sheperde&s;&s;es; every one cocker|ing and care&s;&s;ing his own Mi|&s;tre&s;s. Which done, they fall to their Mu&s;ick, playing &s;everal Tunes upon Flutes made of the Rine of Willows that cover the Bank; upon which they al&s;o &s;it while they a&s;&s;wage the hun|ger which their bathing has excited and &s;harpen'd, putting their own Victuals altogether. One day they gave us a Vi&s;it at our Imcampment, where we pre&s;ented them with &s;everal Gla&s;s Jewels, &s;uch as they make at <HI>Nevers,</HI> in lieu of which, they brought us their Provi&s;ions, more than our Cart would carry.</P>
<P>The 24th. we came to a Fo|re&s;t, out of which there i&s;&s;ued a Bea&s;t about the bigne&s;s of an Elephant, which it re&s;embled in every thing el&s;e but the <HI>Probo|&s;cis.</HI> This Bea&s;t perceiving us,
<PB N="71" REF="50"> recovered the Wood, where I could &s;ee him feed upon the ten|der Branches of the Trees, not being able to nibble the Gra&s;s by rea&s;on of the tallne&s;s of his head. Thereupon judging it to be tame, I went up to it, and of|fer'd it &s;ome Wheat in the Skirt of my Coat, which it &s;wallow'd with &s;ome &s;eeming acknow|ledgment for my kindne&s;s, and kept us Company all the time we &s;taid there under the &s;hade of the Oakes.</P>
<P>The 25th. we made a full &s;top.</P>
<P>The 26th. being adverti&s;ed by <HI>Caraman,</HI> that a Company of neighbouring Shepherds were packing up their Tents, with an intention to change their po&s;t, and that we &s;hould be very welcome in their Company; we accepted the Propo&s;al, as well to continue our Journey with the
<PB N="72" REF="51"> more convenience, as to ob&s;erve the Form and Cu&s;tom of their March, which is thus: The day before the Captain gives notice by the found of a Horn, that they are to be ready the next day. At what time the &s;ignal is no &s;ooner given (&s;o punctual they are) but they begin their March in this Order. Fir&s;t moves the Standard, which is the Head of Bull crowned with Flowers, which they &s;tick upright in the Ground when there is any oc|ca&s;ion of encamping: After that follow the Pipers afoot; the Captain immediately goes be|fore the Children which are car|ried in Carts, with their Tutors, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to have an in&s;pection into their Manners; next the Women and aged Peo|ple carried likewi&s;e in Carts drawn by Bulls, for they have
<PB N="73" REF="51"> no Oxen, neither is it their Cu|&s;tom to geld any other Creatures, dete&s;ting above all things that &s;ort of Mutilation, &s;o familiar among men in <HI>Italy,</HI> as injurious to Nature. After the&s;e follow the men in the full vigour of their years, together with the Baggage, the Guard of which belongs to them, and all the way they laugh and &s;ing, and &s;ome|times dance. Two hours before night they make a &s;top, at what time every Ma&s;ter of a Family carries what Provi&s;ion is nece&s;|&s;ary to his own People in the Carts. We followed them in our Cart till the 28. at what time we took our leaves, becau&s;e they re&s;olv'd to tarry, and we re&s;olv'd to go farther.</P>
<P>The 29th. we met with &s;e|veral Hunt&s;men, who, as they told us, are another &s;ort of wild
<PB N="74" REF="52"> <HI>Tartars,</HI> who feed and cloath them&s;elves with the Fle&s;h and Skins of the Bea&s;ts which they take; and to that purpo&s;e making continual War upon the poor Creatures, with whom they combat, arm'd with a Bow and a Cutlace: Here we made a &s;top, and after Dinner had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee a Tyger pur|&s;ued by two of the&s;e Champions. So &s;oon as they perceived the Bea&s;t, they pre&s;ently let fly their Arrows again&s;t him, of which the fir&s;t flight is not intended to do him any great harm, but on|ly to provoke him the more. But when they perceive the Bea&s;t to make at them in revenge of the Injury, then they be|&s;tow their Arrows upon him thick and three-fold, till the poor Creature having received &s;everal Wounds in his Body, is
<PB N="75" REF="52"> forc'd to yield. At what time one of the Hunters boldly ru&s;h|ing in upon him, cuts off his Head with his Cutlace: Some|times they will &s;truggle with the Bea&s;t, but without any danger, for that they are very nimble, and never alone, otherwi&s;e the Bea&s;t would have the Advan|tage.</P>
<P>The 30th. we pa&s;&s;ed through a Hamlet, where we de&s;ired Pro|vi&s;ions, which they let us have for our Money. Neverthele&s;s, <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> finding him&s;elf in a Veni&s;on-Country, re&s;olv'd to ta&s;te of it; to which purpo&s;e we made a &s;top about Noon, and after a &s;hort Repa&s;t, he be|gan to beat the Fields, with <HI>Car|raman</HI> in his Company, while <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> and my &s;elf &s;et up the Tent, and went to cut Wood for our Kitchen. Toward Eve|ning
<PB N="76" REF="53"> our Hunt&s;men returned loaden with Hares, Phea&s;ants, and Partridges, which we roa&s;t|ed upon a woodden-Spit, and fea&s;ted our &s;elves that Night, if a Fea&s;t could be without Wine; but we were pretty well accu|&s;tomed by this time to want it. The fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> we &s;et for|ward betimes in the Morning, re&s;olved for the future to make our be&s;t of the cool of the day, finding the heats to be very in|commodious. But <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> allur'd with the Succe&s;s he had the day before, was re&s;olved to have the other Hunting-Bout together with his Companion, whom he never brought back again. For the poor <HI>Tartar</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed by a <HI>Tyger,</HI> which leaping of a &s;udden upon him, gave him a gripe by the Neck, and choak'd him before his Ma&s;ter could
<PB N="77" REF="53"> come to his relief, who neverthe|le&s;s revenged his Death with his Scimitar, which he ran full into the Body of the Bea&s;t over gree|dy of his Prey; with which Wound the <HI>Tyger</HI> died, only giving <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> a &s;light Nip in the Arm, which did not hin|der the Victor however from fleaing him, that he might have the Spoils of his Enemy, which he preferred before tho&s;e of an <HI>Aga.</HI></P>
<P>By this accident were we de|prived of our Speech, as if all our three Tongues had been cut out, which cau&s;ed us to bewail our Lo&s;s &s;o much the more, be|cau&s;e we thought it irreparable. We were now to renounce the Society of Men, unle&s;s we in|tended only to appear among them as mute Bea&s;ts. However, we did not forbear to go for|ward,
<PB N="78" REF="54"> in hopes of &s;ome lucky Accident before we had &s;pent all our Victuals, with which we were furni&s;h'd for eight days; all which time we were continually upon the march, but when we either eat or &s;lept, &s;teering our cour&s;e all along directly again&s;t the South-Ea&s;t, <HI>All-devour</HI> &s;erving us in|&s;tead of a Forerunner, at|tacquing with a Heroick Valour all that came in his way. But the mo&s;t famous of his Exploits was this: A very fierce Lyon met him, and thought to have terrified him with his roaring; but <HI>All devour</HI> on the contrary growls, barks, advances, and having joyn'd him at four leaps, nimbly fixes upon his back, and pre&s;ently made him &s;en&s;ible of the &s;harpne&s;s of his Fangs. There|upon the Lyon endeavouring to &s;hake off his Burden, frisk'd a|bout
<PB N="79" REF="54"> in &s;uch a manner, that he threw his Rider, and then flew open jaw'd upon his Antagoni&s;t with a de&s;ign to gripe him by the Neck; but <HI>All-devour</HI> pre|vented him; fixing his Steel|horn &s;o directly in the Palate of his Enemy, that he thru&s;t it quite through and through. But then <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> coming in &s;ea&s;onably to <HI>All devour</HI>'s relief, put an end to the Combat with his Scimitar, unwilling to hazard another en|gagement.</P>
<P>The lovely clear Water that glided along by the &s;ide of a Wood whither we came the 6th. of <HI>May,</HI> invited us to make a &s;top. And here it was that <HI>Monthre&s;or,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the fatal Misfortune of <HI>Carraman,</HI> and all our friendly Per&s;wa&s;ions to the contrary, would needs gratifie that extraordinary Pa&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="80" REF="55"> which he had for Hunting. Thereupon <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> being re|&s;olv'd to keep him company, I was left alone to get ready the Lardings again&s;t their return: And I had the more hopes of his Succe&s;s, in regard that <HI>All devour</HI> followed his Ma&s;ter. Nor had I been deceived, had they had none but Bea&s;ts to contend with; but a De&s;tiny far different at|tended <HI>Monthre&s;or.</HI> For after they had rang'd about for &s;ome hours, they came to a Lake &s;o clear and clean at the bottom, that it invited both, being heat|ed by their Exerci&s;e, and &s;cald|ing heat of the Sun, to go into the Lake and bathe them&s;elves. As for <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> becau&s;e he could not &s;wim, he would not tru&s;t him&s;elf out of his depth, u&s;ing only a medicinal Bath by the Banks of the Lake, while <HI>Mon|thre&s;or</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="55"> diverted and plea&s;ed him|&s;elf with cutting the &s;mooth and liquid Plain through all its Di|men&s;ions. He tried its depth by diving to the bottom, its breadth and length in imitation of the Frog. Sometimes he laid him&s;elf upon his Back to ea&s;e him&s;elf; afterwards re&s;uming the u&s;e of his Limbs with more vigor, with a de&s;ign to cro&s;s the Lake, he met with a Current &s;o rapid, that it carried him to the entrance of a Cavern hollowed under the Mountain that bor|dred upon one &s;ide of the Lake, where he vani&s;h'd of a &s;udden from <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI>'s &s;ight, who made me the Relation with Tears in his Eyes for the Lo&s;s of a Per&s;on &s;o dear to him. I &s;pent the night in extremity of Sorrow, expect|ing day-light, which no &s;ooner appear'd, but I went and viewed
<PB N="82" REF="56"> exactly the &s;everal Places, of which when I had con&s;ider'd all the Circum&s;tances, I de&s;pair'd of ever &s;eeing my Friend again.</P>
<P>The Eighth there aro&s;e &s;uch a furious Tempe&s;t, accompany'd with Rain and Thunder, as if the World had been returning to its fir&s;t <HI>Chaos,</HI> and to com|pleat my Mi&s;eries, I had the Misfortune to &s;ee <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> ran|vers'd to the Earth by a Fla&s;h of Lightning, and thrown four Paces at lea&s;t before the Cart which I follow'd; I threw my &s;elf upon him for &s;ome time quite &s;encele&s;s; but then reco|vering my &s;elf, I began to think that death had put an end to their Mi&s;eries, and that the end of my Friends Misfortunes was but the beginning of my own, in a &s;trange Country, of which the Language and Roads were to
<PB N="83" REF="56"> me unknown, without a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, without &s;upport, without Provi&s;ions or means of &s;ub&s;i|&s;tance. 'Tis true I had Gold and Jewels both of my own and of my deceas'd Companions; but I neither knew how to trade, nor how to agree with any Per|&s;on that could bring me to the Sea-&s;ide, where I might get a convenience to carry me back into my own Country; which I lookt upon as my be&s;t way. At la&s;t con&s;idering that I could get nothing by &s;taying where I was, I re&s;olv'd in the fir&s;t place to pay my la&s;t devoires of Bu|rial to my decea&s;ed Friend: To which purpo&s;e I made u&s;e of my Sword to dig a grave in the Earth four fingers deep, where I laid him at his full length, and cover'd him with the &s;ame Turf which I had par'd
<PB N="84" REF="57"> off: For by our di&s;cour&s;es to|gether, I under&s;tood that &s;uch a Sepulcher pleas'd him be&s;t; for he did not like that Cu&s;tom of the Chri&s;tians to bury in Churches, who not content with a deep Grave, cover the dead Body with a heavy Free-&s;tone. Whereas, &s;aid he, it is much better to carry our Carka&s;es in|to the Fields, where their &s;ub|&s;tance di&s;&s;olving, and &s;erving to nouri&s;h the Plants, receives a kind of new Life; by which means the wrong done to Na|ture by Mortality is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure repair'd. He al&s;o tax'd of &s;otti&s;hne&s;s and inju&s;tice the Cu|&s;tom of embalming; of &s;otti&s;h|ne&s;s, becau&s;e that Death re|ceives no benefit by it: of in|ju&s;tice becau&s;e it defrauds Na|ture of her Rights; for 'tis her de&s;ire that the Corruption of
<PB N="85" REF="57"> one &s;hould be attended by the Generation of another, to which Perfumes are an Enemy, be|cau&s;e they delay the Di&s;&s;olution of the Body which they embalme.</P>
<P>After all leaving <HI>All-devoure</HI> upon his Ma&s;ters Grave, from whence I could by no means al|lure him, I re&s;olv'd to abandon my &s;elf to Fortune, and to the guidance of the Cows; which I determin'd &s;hould take their own fancy, without troubling my &s;elf any farther than only to follow them: In which di&s;tre&s;s, my Provi&s;ions failing me in three days, I was reduc'd to Milk; upon which I liv'd for three Weeks together, wandring through De&s;erts where I could not di&s;cern the lea&s;t print of hu|man Foot&s;tep. In the day time I took care to pick up all the Bru&s;h Wood and dry Sticks I could find
<PB N="86" REF="58"> to make a Fire in the night, which I under&s;tood by the <HI>Tartars</HI> the wild Bea&s;ts would never ap|proach. One time among the re&s;t meditating like a Philo&s;o|pher, I came to a Lake, the deceitful Banks of which giving way to my Hor&s;es Feet, we fell both into the Water, which was of an ill ta&s;te, and began to fill my Mouth. Pre&s;ently I threw my &s;elf off my Hor&s;e to|ward the Land, and laid hold of the fir&s;t Roots I could light up|on, thinking to get up out of the Water, but they being too weak to bear my weight I fell in again; nor had I any other way to get out, but by gra&s;ping the Mudd, and &s;o taking hold of other Roots &s;tronger than the former, by which means I drew my &s;elf to the Shore. So full was I of my <HI>Seneca</HI> at that time;
<PB N="87" REF="58"> and by reading him become &s;o familiar with Death, that in&s;tead of being affrighted to &s;ee him &s;o near me, I rea&s;on'd with my &s;elf in falling, with the &s;ame Tranquillity of mind as I could have done at the greate&s;t di&s;t|ance from danger. My Hor&s;e had the Misfortune to remain there; but I the good for|tune three days after to light in|to a Country well manur'd. I &s;aw that the Lands were till'd, and fenc'd with Diches as in Eu|rope, that the Medows were Pa|lizado'd, the Vinyards wall'd a|bout, and a little farther I met with Gardens and Orchards plan|ted according to Art. This change of the Scene put me in hopes that I &s;hould &s;uddenly meet with Men of our own Fa&s;hions. And with the&s;e hopes I &s;till went on, when by and by I came to a
<PB N="88" REF="59"> place where I heard People talk on the orher &s;ide of a Wall. Upon which I made a &s;top, and li&s;tning under&s;tood their Lan|guage to be <HI>Greek.</HI> What! thought I to my &s;elf, am I mira|culou&s;ly tran&s;ported into <HI>Greece?</HI> Thereupon I went up into my Cart to &s;ee whither I could di&s;|cover any thing like to what I had heard; and then I &s;aw Peo|ple weeding a Field that was &s;own with Corn, and planted with Vines after the manner of <HI>Naples.</HI> At fir&s;t I took time to con&s;ider, not without a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that Per&s;ons who had no|thing of a Country Meen, &s;hould employ them&s;elves in Hu&s;|bandry. I rous'd my &s;elf, I felt my &s;elf, and yet could hardly believe my &s;elf, or rather I could not believe but that I dreamt, or that my Life had been only a
<PB N="89" REF="59"> Dream, till this very Moment. However at length I opened my Lips and &s;aluted the Gentlemen with a <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, or <HI>God &s;ave ye.</HI> Thereupon they &s;tar'd upon me, and I ask'd them in what Coun|try I was? In the Territories of <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> cry'd they, and you are welcome. Thereupon I made them a &s;hort Relation of my Misfortunes; upon which one of the Company by con&s;ent of the re&s;t came to me, and un|dertaking to drive my Cart, brought me to a Country Hou&s;e, about Five hunder'd Pa|ces di&s;tant; where &s;o &s;oon as we came into the fir&s;t Court, another took my Cows and led them to the Stable, while my Guide carry'd me into the Hou&s;e, the neatne&s;s of which, together with the Gaietry of the People charm'd me at fir&s;t
<PB N="90" REF="60"> &s;ight; nor did they delay to bring me in Refre&s;hments im|mediately. Judge you whe|ther I were not overjoy'd at a happine&s;s &s;o unexpected, and whether I did not with Plea&s;ure behold the Wine in the Gla&s;&s;es, not having ta&s;ted any in &s;o long time before. The Collation be|ing ended, I was conducted in|to a Chamber, where they told me I might take my Re|po&s;e at lei&s;ure, and make u&s;e of the Conveniencies of the Lodg|ing as long as I pleas'd. There|upon &s;eeing the Bed hand&s;om and decently adorn'd, as much weary as I was, I made ha&s;te in|to it, and lay till the next morn|ing very late.</P>
<P>In this delightful Man&s;ion I &s;pent three days, amid&s;t the In|nocent Sports of a mo&s;t Charm|ing Youthfulne&s;s, with which

<P>After the Death of <HI>Alexan|der,</HI> his Courtiers &s;har'd his Em|pire among them&s;elves, and Go|vern'd it after a manner &s;o far from the Intentions of that

The re&s;t of the Wi&s;e Men of <HI>Greece</HI> being inform'd of this de&s;ign were de&s;irous to be of the Company, and all toge|ther carry along with them what they had of mo&s;t precious Value, more e&s;pecially the Books which you will &s;ee in the great Library at <HI>Heliopolis.</HI> Thus ha|ving without danger cro&s;s'd the
<PB N="94" REF="62"> Seas that &s;eparate us from our Ancient Country, &s;o &s;oon as they got a &s;hore and &s;aw the Land inhabited, they deem'd it a horrible attempt to expel the Inhabitants, only they de&s;ir'd free pa&s;&s;age, which was granted them, and &s;o they went forward, being re&s;olv'd to make War up|on none, unle&s;s thereto pro|vok'd; nor to &s;ettle in any place to the prejudice of the Ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, though they might have done it, as being &s;ufficient|ly numerous, and well provid|ed with Arms. After they had wander'd two Years and two Months, at length they came to this Sunny Region, which when they found abandon'd, here they &s;topp'd, and &s;atisfi'd them&s;elves with the Fruits which they found growing here and there among the Plants, that Nature volunta|rily
<PB N="95" REF="62"> produc'd, the &s;ame upon which we live at this day; tho' perhaps &s;omewhat bettter, through the Indu&s;try of our Progenitors, who grubb'd up the Lands, and in proce&s;s of time brought them to that Per|fection, wherein we &s;till pre&s;erve them. They &s;hared the pains and labour of Tillage one among another, every one according to his be&s;t Skill, making u&s;e of the In&s;truments and knowledge which they had brought along with them; &s;ome for planting Vinyards, others for &s;owing, o|thers for forging the Smiths work, and others for building and Architecture. When they either cut or grubb'd up the Wood, they did not &s;o de&s;troy it, but that they re&s;erv'd at con|venient di&s;tances, enough for Firing, or for other u&s;es; having
<PB N="96" REF="63"> divided the Country, which in Diameter is Four hunder'd and four&s;core Furlongs, which is Fifty nine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, into as many Cantons and Country Seats, as it contains at this day. Afterwards they built a City in the very Navel of their Teritory, for the &s;eat or re&s;idence of the Soul of this My&s;terious Body, from the middle equally to in|fluence all the Parts of its Cir|cumference. This City they call'd <HI>Heliopolis</HI> in Honour of the Sun, which we believe to be the Center of the World, and the Heart from which tho&s;e Spirits flow that enliven it. After that, they took into Con&s;ideration all the Forms of Government of which they had any knowledge, either by their own experience or by reading, and ob&s;erving the defects of each, they thought
<PB N="97" REF="63"> it more to the purpo&s;e to cull out of every one what they deem'd to be mo&s;t profitable, taking the liberty to add or de|mini&s;h, as they thought it mo&s;t &s;uitable for the Common Good, as aiming to Erect this their Bo|dy of Government upon the Pat|tern and Foundation of a Fami|ly well order. To this purpo&s;e they agreed upon a General A&s;|&s;embly, where all the Men a|bove thirty years &s;hould have a Right to vote: So that of twelve thou&s;and Souls, which made up the whole Body, three thou&s;and were privileg'd to be at the A&s;|&s;embly, partly Philo&s;ophers, part|ly of other Profe&s;&s;ions who had run the &s;ame Ri&s;co, either for Affection or Intere&s;t. Out of the&s;e three they made choice of a thou&s;and, to whom they &s;ub|mitted the Determination of all
<PB N="98" REF="64"> their Concerns, having &s;o great a Veneration for them, that they believ'd them Infallible. But afterwards con&s;idering that the number was too great, they cho&s;e rather to lo&s;e their &s;hare which they had in the Soveraign Government of a growing Re|publick, than to expo&s;e it to Confu&s;ion, which u&s;ually hap|pens, when a number too va&s;t is therein concern'd. Thereupon they reduc'd their number to three hundred, to whom they &s;urrender'd the whole Authority which had been &s;urrender'd to them by the General A&s;&s;embly. Which three hundred being con|vinc'd of the nece&s;&s;ity of a Pre|&s;ident or Chief, made choice of <HI>Mi&s;argyre,</HI> whom they inve&s;ted with an Authority to make Laws, and to call together the Council for their Approbation. This Philo|&s;opher,
<PB N="99" REF="64"> not &s;o much reverenc'd for his Age, as for the integrity of his manners, which was known to all the People, found little or no difficulty to e&s;tabli&s;h what he thought mo&s;t convenient; nor did he propo&s;e any thing but what was highly to be ap|plauded. And therefore having &s;ummon'd a Council about eight days after, he thus deliver'd him|&s;elf.</P>

<PB N="100" REF="65"> mind, to make a choice of Con|&s;titutions, and thereupon have reduc'd them all to one &s;ingle Law, the only Law that ever I heard of in all my life, and which I believe to be under|&s;tood by all that are endued with a clear Under&s;tanding; and this is the Law of Nature, imprinted in our Hearts, con|fe&s;s'd and acknowledged by all tho&s;e who have not a Rea&s;on perverted and di&s;ordered by their Pa&s;&s;ions; and therefore to come to the Mark at which e|very good Legi&s;lator chiefly ought to aim, that is to &s;ay, the maintaining of Peace a|mong this People, who have willingly &s;ubmitted them&s;elves under our Conduct, I think it &s;ufficient ince&s;&s;antly to admo|ni&s;h them to follow the Lu&s;tre of that <HI>Flambeau</HI> which enligh|tens
<PB N="101" REF="65"> them to obey Rea&s;on, and above all the lovely Precept which that divine Mi&s;tre&s;s infu|&s;es into the Brea&s;t of all Men. The Nature of man is his Rea&s;on. Does not &s;he alone teach every particular man not to do to a|nother what he would not have done to him&s;elf? Now this Command alone being pun|ctually ob&s;erv'd, is not this a|lone &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve peace among men? And therefore let it be &s;ufficient for us to ordain, That the mo&s;t prudent among us be oblig'd to undeceive all tho&s;e, in whom fal&s;e Mi&s;takes and Prejudices have &s;tifled the Sentiments which Nature in|&s;pires into us, for by this means we &s;hall avoid multitude of Laws, and the Tra&s;h and Trum|pery of Proce&s;s that attends them. Now there is no need
<PB N="102" REF="66"> of publi&s;hing this Law of our Rea&s;on, it is already within us: But in regard the Employments of Life, or our Pa&s;&s;ions veiling and clouding our Under&s;tand|ings, hinder &s;everal from taking notice of it, my Opinion is to publi&s;h a Decree, That every Ma&s;ter of a Family have fairly written in large Characters, and in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of his Hou&s;e the&s;e two words, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, <HI>Follow Na|ture,</HI> to the end that being al|ways thus in view, it may be never out of their Memory. Let us al&s;o make another De|cree, That our Children be well educated in pur&s;uance of this Law. Let them be taught betimes, in the fir&s;t place, that by it all Civil and Criminal Pro|ce&s;&s;es ought to be determined, according to the Sentence of
<PB N="103" REF="66"> tho&s;e wi&s;e Men, with whom the Office and Dignity of the Magi&s;tracy is entru&s;ted.</Q>
<P>Then having divided all the People into four di&s;tinct <HI>Cla&s;&s;es,</HI> of Children to the Age of &s;even years; of Youths, till eighteen; of young Men, till thirty; and of Men in their perfection, from thirty to the end of their lives, he ordain'd that the fir&s;t &s;hould remain purely under the tuition of their Parents, who be&s;ides their in&s;tructing them in good Manners, &s;hould al&s;o teach them to read: That from thence they &s;hould be &s;ent to the &s;everal Schools, there to be in&s;tructed by Ma&s;ters cho&s;en by the <HI>Council,</HI> in the liberal Arts, in Military Di&s;cipline, and in Moral and Natural Philo&s;ophy: That &s;uch as &s;hould be deem'd uncapable of learning the Sciences, &s;hould
<PB N="104" REF="67"> be put to Trades and Manufa|ctures mo&s;t &s;uitable to their <HI>Ge|nius</HI>'s; for certain it is, that Na|ture, be&s;ides an inclination to Arts, furni&s;hes us al&s;o with Fa|culties nece&s;&s;ary to attain tho&s;e Arts. That being arriv'd to the Age of the third <HI>Cla&s;&s;is,</HI> they &s;hould be &s;ent to the Country-Hou&s;es, where after they had &s;erv'd twelve years under the Directions of a Governour de|puted by the <HI>Council,</HI> they &s;hould return to the City to be mar|ried, and then to &s;pend the re&s;t of their days in Peace and Tran|quility. That the young Vir|gins al&s;o &s;hould be brought up in Schools apart, and in&s;tructed in Arts mo&s;t &s;uitable to their Sex, then &s;ent into the Country for the Country husbanding, under the care of a Mi&s;tre&s;s who &s;hould be an&s;werable for their Educa|tion
<PB N="105" REF="67"> to the Council; with this difference only, that they &s;hould &s;erve no longer than only twen|ty five years of age, and then to be &s;ent home to their Parents to be married at their di&s;cretion, preferring before all, the Per|&s;ons to whom they &s;hall have engag'd their Affections in the Country, who&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions they have more rea&s;on to know than tho&s;e of others whom they never &s;aw in their lives.</P>
<P>Then con&s;idering that diffe|rences among Citizens generally proceed from di&s;putes about Property, it was ordain'd, That every thing &s;hould be in Com|mon; and that there &s;hould be Magazines in &s;everal Quarters of the City; whence there &s;hould be a di&s;tribution made of all things nece&s;&s;ary for Food and Rayment. They al&s;o enacted
<PB N="106" REF="68"> &s;everal other Laws and Con&s;ti|tutions, of which you will &s;uffi|ciently be inform'd if you make any &s;tay among us.</P>
<P>He al&s;o propos'd to continue this number of three hundred, the members of which &s;hould be call'd <HI>Wi&s;e Men:</HI> That thirty of the mo&s;t ancient of this number receiv'd, &s;hould be of the &s;tand|ing Council, to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of which the re&s;t &s;hould be called upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions, when the thirty &s;hould think it expedient; and that the&s;e thirty &s;hould have for their Pre&s;ident the mo&s;t ancient among them, who &s;hould be al&s;o the chief Per|&s;on in the <HI>State;</HI> and that when one Place fell vacant, it &s;hould be fill'd up with the mo&s;t ancient of the hundred and &s;eventy, and his place &s;hould be &s;upplied by one cho&s;en by the <HI>Thirty.</HI></P>
<PB N="107" REF="68">
<P>All this was approved by the three hundred; and to the end the&s;e Con&s;titutions might re|main inviolable to perpetuity, as the fundamental Law of the Kingdom, they &s;ummon'd toge|ther once more the General A&s;|&s;embly, who having heard the&s;e Con&s;titutions read, &s;ub&s;crib'd them without the lea&s;t He&s;itati|on, promi&s;ing to ob&s;erve and defend them with their lives; and unanimou&s;ly pronouncing an <HI>Anathema</HI> upon all &s;uch as hereafter prove refractary and di&s;obedient; that is to &s;ay, the Cur&s;e of Bani&s;hment, which is indeed the only Puni&s;hment that we inflict for the highe&s;t Crimes, and which we fear more than Death. So that of three of our Citizens that have been con|demn'd in all &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;et|tlement of our Commonwealth,
<PB N="108" REF="69"> to this pre&s;ent time, there was not one but would have rather cho&s;en to have been his own Exe|cutioner, than to have been ex|pell'd his Country by perpetual Bani&s;hment. <HI>Mi&s;angyres</HI> al&s;o pre|&s;ently gave te&s;timony of the &s;in|cerity of his Soul by his &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to tho&s;e Ordinances which he had made; for that in regard he was not the mo&s;t ancient of the Society, he &s;urrendred his Pre&s;ident&s;hip to his Senior: but it was an&s;wer'd him, That as to that particular, the Law was not to take place till after his Death, and &s;o oblig'd him to keep his Station. From that time for|ward the <HI>Thirty</HI> have been So|veraign Rulers in all affairs both private and publick. The re&s;t are entru&s;ted with the Superin|tendency over the Tribes, and In&s;pection into the Schools, the
<PB N="109" REF="69"> Manufactures and Magazines. They are al&s;o the fir&s;t Judges of all differences that ari&s;e within the &s;everal Cantons where they dwell, from whom becau&s;e they are look'd upon as they are, to be Per&s;ons of great Equity and In|tegrity, you &s;hall very rarely hear of any Appeals to the <HI>Thirty</HI> from their Determinations.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e gave me &s;o great an <HI>Idea</HI> of the City, that I mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd him to vouch&s;afe me an occa&s;ion of &s;ee|ing it with the fir&s;t opportunity. Thereupon, to morrow, &s;aid he, I &s;hall &s;end away the Carts ac|cording to order, by which means you will have the oppor|tunity of going along with my Deputy, to whom I will give order to be your Guide, and to pre&s;ent you to the <HI>Wi&s;e-man</HI> of this Precinct, who will take care
<PB N="110" REF="70"> of your per&s;on. The&s;e Waggons which are built much after the manner of <HI>Holland,</HI> are drawn by Bulls that bear the mark of the Country-hou&s;e that &s;ends them, and of the Tribe to which they belong; and after they have de|liver'd their Provi&s;ions into the Magazines, they carry back what is contain'd in the Governour or <HI>Archon</HI>'s Note, for the Service of the Farm, together with &s;uch Parents as have a de&s;ire to &s;ee their Children, as al&s;o &s;ick Per|&s;ons, to whom change of Air is pre&s;cribed for their recovery.</P>
<P>Having therefore taken leave of the <HI>Archon,</HI> whom I pre&s;ent|ed with a Ca&s;e of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Knives with Oriental Agate Handles em|belli&s;h'd with Gold; I took the fir&s;t <HI>Waggon,</HI> and plac'd my &s;elf next to the Deputy, who drove the <HI>Waggon</HI> in a Seat covered
<PB N="111" REF="70"> over, and large enough to hold three Per&s;ons with ea&s;e. The way, which is about five and twenty miles, or two hundred Furlongs, according to their mea|&s;ure, to me &s;eem'd very &s;hort, as well through the learned Di|&s;cour&s;e of the Waggoner, as for the Diver&s;ity of Objects which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to me in this enchanted Country. We baited at all the Country-hou&s;es upon the Road, and were treat|ed with Dancing and Mu&s;ick. There is not one navigable Ri|ver in all the Country, but a great number of &s;mall Streams and Brooks, of which &s;ome have Water enough to turn their Corn-mills and Paper-mills. They have no high Mountains, but only &s;ome few Hillocks, fertile in Wine and Oil, which &s;et forth the Beauty of the Plains, like
<PB N="112" REF="71"> precious Stones enchas'd in Gold-&s;miths Work. The Soil yields fifteen for one, and the goodne&s;s of the Pa&s;turage di&s;|covers it &s;elf by the excellent ta&s;te of their meat.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;opher care&s;s'd me with more than ordinary Civili|ty, and carried me to the <HI>Fore&s;te|ria,</HI> or Foreigner's Lodge, which is a Hou&s;e built at one of the ends of the Town adjoining to the Ma|nufacturies and Schools, where &s;trangers are entertain'd, and their Expences honourably de|fray'd. The fir&s;t two days, be|&s;ides the days of arrival and de|parture, they fea&s;t very &s;plen|didly; but if the Stranger &s;tays any longer, he is treated as a Ci|tizen: Though to &s;ay the truth, they are not much troubled with Strangers, for very few travel thither, for that the <HI>Europeans,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="71"> who are the greate&s;t Travellers in the World, have no know|ledge of the place; either ima|gining that there is nothing &s;o beautiful in <HI>Tartary,</HI> or that the difficulties of travelling thither are un&s;urmountable. However, there was in the City when I was there, a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> of <HI>A&s;tra|can,</HI> two <HI>Tartars</HI> and one <HI>Per|&s;ian,</HI> whom meer chance had brought thither as well as my &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Reports of my Arrival being &s;pread among the Philo&s;o|phers, I never wanted Compa|ny, which the rarity of the Acci|dent brought to vi&s;it me. They told me that they had not &s;een in their City before &s;ixty years together any of the third Part of the Continent which we in|habit, and which they only know by means of the ancient Geogra|phy,
<PB N="114" REF="72"> but one; which Per&s;on was a <HI>Frenchman</HI> who died three Months after his Arrival, with a Surfeit of <HI>Champignons</HI> and new Wine, which he drank to exce&s;s, it being then Vintage-time. Up|on that I told them, that I was likewi&s;e a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> which put them into a Laughter, becau&s;e they &s;aid my Language &s;poke the contrary; for that as they &s;aid, they had in their Library a Book that they found in &s;trip|ping a deceas'd Pilgrim, wherein they &s;aw nothing that re&s;embl'd my &s;peech. 'Tis true, Gentle|men, &s;aid I, that in <HI>France</HI> they &s;peak otherwi&s;e than I do, for I under&s;tand the <HI>Greek</HI> which I learn'd by my own endeavours, out of a natural inclination which I had for a Language that was formerly &s;poken by the mo&s;t excellent People in the World.</P>
<PB N="115" REF="72">
<P>But of all that came to vi&s;it me at my fir&s;t coming, Per&s;ons of Wit and and Learning, <HI>Eu|genes</HI> was the Per&s;on toward whom my Affection mo&s;t enclin'd, as being one who&s;e humour I found to be mo&s;t agreeable with mine. Thereupon I enter'd into a &s;trict League of Friend&s;hip with him, &s;o that whether at our Re|creations or our Studies we never for&s;ook each other. Which he might the more ea&s;ily do, in re|gard that being, by rea&s;on of his Youth, excluded from the ma|nagement of publick Affairs, he was the more at lei&s;ure. So that he was my con&s;tant Guide, wherever my Curio&s;ity led me.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place he carry'd me to a Pillar built much like the Monument in <HI>London,</HI> but ri&s;ing higher, from whence I could take a full view of the City. It is
<PB N="116" REF="73"> &s;eated in a Plain, water'd within and without with &s;everal Rivu|lets of Running Water. The Hou&s;es are Low-built, all but the publick Buildings; which becau&s;e they take up a larger ex|tent of Ground than the private Hou&s;es, generally over look them. But none either pub|lick or private are above two Stories high. The Figure of it is round, and it is about three good Miles in Diameter, without Walls, defended only by a &s;ingle Moat, which is fed by the Ri|vers that water it both within and without. From this high Pillar I had al&s;o a Pro&s;pect of all the plea&s;ant Country round a|bout in its mo&s;t beautiful Trim; as al&s;o of the Country Hou&s;es &s;catter'd up and down at equal di&s;tances, like a Fleet of Ships upon the Ocean in a Calm, or
<PB N="117" REF="73"> like &s;o many Stars in the Firma|ment in a &s;erene Sea&s;on. About Two hundred Miles from hence, they that have a very quick &s;ight may di&s;cern a Chain of Mountains, which by rea&s;on of the va&s;tne&s;s of the di&s;tance, &s;eem to be embody'd with the Clouds them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And thus having con&s;ider'd the City in general, we de&s;cend|ed to view it in particular. It is divided into three Quarters or Wards, of which the fir&s;t in the heart of the City, derives its name from the Sun, the &s;econd from the Council, and the third from the Schools. The Streets are wide, clean and &s;treight, like tho&s;e of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> but with|out Trees; and in&s;tead of Fil|thy Kennels it is &s;tor'd with Ri|vers that carry away the na&s;ti|ne&s;s of the Street, and all un|cleanne&s;s
<PB N="118" REF="74"> from the City. As well the <HI>Piazza's</HI> as the Streets are a|dorn'd with Portico's like <HI>Bolig|na,</HI> as neat and elegant as the Cloi&s;ter of the <HI>Chartrena</HI> at <HI>Pa|via.</HI> So that you may walk a|bout your Bu&s;ine&s;s at all Sea&s;ons free from the annoyance of heat or rain. The Roof of the&s;e Portico's is &s;upported by Pillars without, and Pila&s;ters within (I mean adjoining to the Wall it &s;elf of the Hou&s;es) of the <HI>Do|rick Order,</HI> in the Council Ward; of the <HI>Ionick Order</HI> in the Schools Ward; and of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> in the Ward of the Sun. The Doors and Windows ob&s;erve the &s;ame Symmetry. The tops of their Hou&s;es are cover'd with Lead, in a Figure of a Duomo, ending with a Cuppola of Cop|per all gilt over. The Gutters al&s;o being gilded are laid upon
<PB N="119" REF="74"> a Bali&s;ter of hard Stone, between the Windows of which they di&s;|charge the Rain Water into the Rivulets underneath. Every Hou&s;e has a Garden belonging to it on the back &s;ide, with a Foun|tain, cau&s;ing a delicate Pro&s;pect at the Entrance. And both the Streets and Portico's are &s;o order'd, that the back &s;ides of the Hou&s;es face each other the Gardens lying between, only parted by a Rail, from on both &s;ides there is a continual fall of clear Water from the Mouth of &s;ome Antick Figure or o|ther.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Piazza of the Suns Ward, which is Six hundred Paces in Diameter, there &s;tands a Structure like the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> with this ad|dition that it is &s;urrounded with a Portico, &s;upported with Co|lumns
<PB N="120" REF="75"> of Porphyry, the Chapter and Ba&s;es of which are gilt. There are four entrances into it at four oppo&s;ite Doors fronting the four Cardinal Points; and the coming to it is through as many Gutters leading to the Cir|cumference of the Grand Portico of the Piazza. The Roof opens in the middle, as well to give light to that Pompous Enclo&s;ure, as to give vent to the Perfumes that are burnt therein. In the Body of the Wall under that part where the Roof begins to ri&s;e, are Three hundred and &s;ix|ty round holes, an&s;wering to the Three hundred and &s;ixty degrees of the Ecliptick, to mark out the Point of the Zodiack which the Sun touches every day above the Earth, which according to their Opinion moves and not the Sun, whom they will have
<PB N="121" REF="75"> to be fix'd to the Center of the World. This va&s;t <HI>Cupola</HI> is rear'd up into the Air with a double row of Alaba&s;ter Pillars, of the Order of the <HI>Caryatides;</HI> the workman&s;hip mo&s;t delicate, the Drapery of Gold, and the Ba&s;e of the &s;ame, upon a Pede&s;tal of Ja&s;per. The Frize enrich'd with <HI>Releifs</HI> of Gold, having its <HI>Cor|niche</HI> al&s;o of Alaba&s;ter, is &s;ur|mounted with a Bali&s;ter of the &s;ame Metal. The Counter Pila|&s;ters of the <HI>Corridore</HI> are pro|portionable to the beauty of the Columns, their hollow &s;paces be|ing fill'd up with Serpentine, as is the whole Concavity of the Duomo with <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful that ever I &s;aw in the mo&s;t curious Cabinets in <HI>Ita|ly.</HI> From the Center of the Pave|ment which is of Alaba&s;ter as white as Snow, ri&s;e three
<PB N="122" REF="76"> round Steps of Steel, adorn'd with Arabick Figures of <HI>Re|port,</HI> al&s;o of Gold, which frame the Ba&s;e of a <HI>Tripos</HI> all of ma&s;&s;y Gold, enchas'd with precious Stones, of which the upper mo&s;t Figure, like an Eagles Head, bears a little Perfumer of Gold likewi&s;e, to which Rubies and Diamonds contribute &s;uch a Lu|&s;tre, as dazles the Eyes of the Beholder. The uppermo&s;t of the Steps publi&s;hes al&s;o the Magnifi|cence of the Per&s;on, that pre&s;ent|ed &s;o rich a Jewel to the Repub|lick, by this In&s;cription in Let|ters of Gold, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. <HI>The Gift of</HI> Cho&s;ores <HI>King of the Per&s;ians.</HI> The Circle of Gold that &s;urrounds the O|verture of the <HI>Duomo,</HI> &s;preads his Beams of the &s;ame Metal upon the lead that covers it without.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;h'd at &s;o much Riches,
<PB N="123" REF="76"> I could hardly believe my own Eyes. But my Guide gave me to under&s;tand that the Quarries that afforded the Marble which adorn'd this &s;umptuous Temple, were not far di&s;tant. And then con&s;idering with my &s;elf, that that &s;ame Luxury which ruins larger and more Potent States than this, was bani&s;h'd hence, I began to think, that in &s;o many Ages they might have probably heap'd together &s;o much Gold as I &s;aw.</P>
<P>From thence I went to the Pi|azza of the Schools, where &s;tands a Fountain adorn'd with a larger Aigret than both tho&s;e together in the <HI>Vatican:</HI> And the fall of the Water like Dew, is &s;o artfully contriv'd, that the Beams of the Sun continually form in the dri&s;ling Rain the Daughter of <HI>Thaumantes.</HI></P>
<PB N="124" REF="77">
<P>The Piazza of the Council Ward was adorn'd with a more Magnificent Fountain repre&s;ent|ing the Cele&s;tial Sphear, &s;upport|ed by a Column of Granate Stone; &s;o conformable to the Sy&s;teme of <HI>Copernicus,</HI> that I be|gan to think that &s;ome of his Fol|lowers had communicated his de|&s;ign to the&s;e Philo&s;ophers; but they told me that the &s;ame Do|ctrine had taken Root in their Schools above a thou&s;and years before; and that as for <HI>Coperni|cus</HI> they had never &s;o much as heard of his Name. The Globe of the Sun, which makes the Cen|ter from all the Points of its Convexity, ca&s;ts an infinite num|ber of watry Beams, with which it be&s;prinkles the Earth; the Moon, withal the re&s;t of the Planets, and all the Parts of the Spherical Concavity, whence the
<PB N="125" REF="77"> &s;ame Beams de&s;cend like Rain into a Receptacle fa&s;hion'd like a Roman S or <HI>Oget</HI> in Architecture, made of a Stone &s;o hard that they were twelve years before they could hollow and poli&s;h it.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Piazza</HI> live the Thirty, who a&s;&s;emble every Morning in the hall of the Grand Palace, ei|ther to do Ju&s;tice to particular Per&s;ons, or to con&s;ult about the publick Affairs. If the Pre&s;i|dent be indi&s;pos'd, the mo&s;t An|cient next to him pre&s;ides; and they Summon the Senior of the Two hunder'd and &s;eventy to &s;upply the number of the Thirty.</P>
<P>There are neither Proctors nor Notaries, nor Advocates to be &s;een in this Place, every one Pleads for him&s;elf. But if they find the Per&s;on to be uncapable to Plead for him&s;elf, he has li|berty to bring a Philo&s;opher,
<PB N="126" REF="78"> who is his Friend, who does him that kindne&s;s gratis. I often frequented their Courts through plea&s;ure, which I took in hearing the Polite Orations which are there &s;poken. For the &s;tream of di&s;cour&s;e is not interrupted with the irk&s;om Citation of Law Ca&s;es, with which our Advocates &s;tuff their Pleadings: They ha|ving no other Law to &s;tudy but that of Nature, in&s;tead of the Volums of <HI>Codes</HI> and <HI>Dige&s;ts,</HI> they read them&s;elves, and draw from their proper Fund the Ar|guments by which they maintain the Right of their Cau&s;e, yet not without the flouri&s;hes and beauties of true Rea&s;oning nei|ther. Among the re&s;t I was pre&s;ent at the Oration of a young Philo|&s;opher upon a Fact, which merits the Relation by rea&s;on of the Ex|travagancy of the Ca&s;e.</P>
<PB N="127" REF="78">
<P><HI>Philaretes</HI> (for that was the young Philo&s;ophers Name) had made his own Caravan in the &s;ame Country Hou&s;e with <HI>&V;rania,</HI> who&s;e rare Beauty, ac|company'd with her &s;weet and obliging humour had ren|der'd him her ab&s;olute Ado|rer. But he was not her only Admirer, for he had a Rival who&s;e Name was <HI>Philip;</HI> and the &s;trife was between the&s;e two who &s;hould gain this Incomparable fair one by the A&s;&s;iduity of their Services, or who &s;hould give her the mo&s;t undenyable Marks of his Pa&s;&s;ion. One day <HI>Philaretes</HI> being in the Fields, a Fire took hold of a Barn through which there was a nece&s;&s;ity to pa&s;s to the Chamber where <HI>&V;rania</HI> was crying out for help. Pre&s;ently <HI>Philip</HI> ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, dart|ing through the Flames, which a

<P>The Novelty of a Cau&s;e, for which there had not been a Pre|&s;ident in any Age before, &s;o &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd the Judges, that they had never agreed in favour of the Suppliant, but that <HI>Alcibiades</HI> a&s;&s;ured them, That he had ju&s;t &s;uch another de&s;ign in his Youth, from which nothing could have diverted him but the change of a better Fortune, and that mo&s;t certainly it was a

Thereupon the two Mothers paid that morn|ful Office to their Children with tho&s;e &s;ad Sentiments which are natural to Women upon &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions.

Howe|ver to pre&s;erve the Memory of &s;o rare an Action, they caus'd to be engrav'd upon a Marble Mo|nument again&s;t the Garden Wall two Rings one within another, in the mid&s;t of a flaming fire, with this Motto <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, to inti|mate, <HI>That neither Death it &s;elf could part them.</HI></P>
<P>The Wards are &s;ubdivided in|to Tribes; the Council Ward in|to Twelve, the Suns Ward into Thirteen, and the Schools Ward into five only, becau&s;e the Col|leges and Manufactures take up the greate&s;t part of it. The Council of <HI>Thirty</HI> al&s;o deputes Three out of the Two hunder'd and &s;eventy to govern every Tribe; of which the one takes care of the Concerns within, the other without; that is to &s;ay, of
<PB N="140" REF="85"> the Farms belonging to his Tribe, and the Third is &s;uperin|tendant over the Magazines; for every Tribe hath its particular Magazines, to which the private People repair every day to fetch their nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions. There is nothing of &s;ervitude among them, for they are all their own Servants, only when they grow old they are waited upon by their Children, who upon their returns from performing their Duties in the Farms, or other Places, retire to their Parents whom they Honour and Reve|rence as long as they live.</P>
<P>The Schools are their Semina|ries of Vertue, Sciences and Arts, as well Military as Civil, where their Children are educated un|der excellent Ma&s;ters, who the fir&s;t year trie the Di&s;po&s;ition and Genius of their Scholars, and if
<PB N="141" REF="85"> they find any one uncapable of learning, they inform the Super|intendant, who &s;ends him to the Manufactures with leave to make choice of what Trade he plea&s;es, which he is taught by Ma&s;ters made choice of by the Council of Thirty: And under the&s;e Ma|&s;ters it is that they follow their &s;everal Callings, in &s;everal Apart|ments of the Building, be&s;tow|ing their pains upon all things either nece&s;&s;ary or &s;eemly for the u&s;e of human Life, and their Labours are afterwards di&s;tribu|ted into the Magazines for the common Service of the People.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t things taught in the&s;e Schools are the Mathematicks, of which they learn all the Parts, e|ven to A&s;tronomy, wherein they excel: For as for A&s;trology they reject it as a frivolous thing. And indeed I could wi&s;h that
<PB N="142" REF="86"> &s;uch as wa&s;te their Time in that Study, or make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ult our A&s;trologers con|cerning their future De&s;tinies, and all &s;uch who &s;hall read the&s;e Travels had the &s;ame &s;corn and contempt of A&s;trology which this wi&s;e People, by me &s;o for|tunately di&s;cover'd, have. Give me leave therefore to &s;ay this by the by, for the Edification of my Reader, &s;ince &s;o fair an Op|portunity pre&s;ents it &s;elf, that I my &s;elf formerly &s;tudy'd this Art, and had made &s;o fair a Pro|gre&s;s in the knowledge of Schemes and Horo&s;copes, that I began to be in high Reque&s;t; but more the &s;ucce&s;s which my Ma&s;ter had who taught me at <HI>Rome,</HI> who was A&s;trologer to Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina.</HI> However the better to a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf of the &s;olidity of this Art, I was re&s;olv'd
<PB N="143" REF="86"> to &s;urprize him: To this pur|po&s;e, one Morning I pre&s;ented him the Figure of my Nativity, which I had been calculating all night long, accompany'd with his own Directions. Very true it is, that he knew of him&s;elf that it was mine; but then the Oppo|&s;ition of Saturn to my A&s;cendant in the third Degree, which is my third Year, he made a doubt of it, not believing that I had e|&s;caped &s;o fatal a direction. Thereupon reque&s;ting him to tell me what it was, <HI>A Shipwrack,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>wherein I &s;hould ab&s;olute|ly peri&s;h.</HI> This an&s;wer, more convincing to me than that of <HI>Thra&s;ibulus</HI> to <HI>Tiberius</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> made me &s;tand in Admiration. Afterwards &s;earching by what means I might avoid the danger, he ob&s;erv'd that Venus came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="144" REF="87"> by correcting the Malignity of Saturn. This lucky Accident ha|ving encourag'd me to make a farther Progre&s;s in a Study, whereby I thought to have rais'd my &s;elf above Humanity, I fell to it &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;pent &s;ix Months in the examination of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> till I came to that pa&s;|&s;age, where he &s;ays, That they who&s;e <HI>Horo&s;cope</HI> or <HI>A&s;cendant</HI> the Leg of <HI>Capricorn</HI> governs, &s;hould be troubl'd with Di&s;ea&s;es in the Legs; which is one of the grand Maxims held at this day by the A&s;trologers, as are all the re&s;t of this great Ma&s;ter in their Art. But then &s;aid I to my &s;elf 'tis not the immoveable Point or &s;pace of the Heavens which influences, but rather the Con&s;tellation which is there plac'd, of which the Leg makes a part, and from whence that twelfth Part of the
<PB N="145" REF="87"> <HI>Zodiack</HI> deriv'd its name, in the time of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> above &s;eventeen Ages ago. Now every Age the Stars of the Figure advancing a de|gree from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t, they ought to have recoil'd as much. Neverthele&s;s our A&s;trolo|gers at pre&s;ent call tho&s;e Parts or Spaces by the &s;ame name, and ground their Predictions thereup|on, as if the Figure were &s;till fix'd in the &s;ame place. Be&s;ides &s;uppo&s;ing that the Leg of <HI>Capricorn</HI> had not chang'd place, who does not di&s;|cern that this Maxim was ground|ed upon the Relation of one Limb to another purely Imaginary, there being nothing of Reality in any of the&s;e Figures; &s;o that the Foun|dation of their Art appearing to me &s;o vain, I took a di&s;liking to the Science it &s;elf. Many other Rea&s;ons al&s;o &s;o cleanly convinc'd me of the fal&s;ity of it, that at length I quite
<PB N="146" REF="88"> and clean abandon'd it. Seeing that if the A&s;trologer lit upon a pa&s;t Accident for once, I attribute it, as the Learned Per&s;ons of this Country of the Sun do, meerly to Chance, which &s;ometimes may pro|duce a Truth among thou&s;ands of Lyes.</P>
<P>From the Mathematicks they pa&s;s to Grammar learning, withal at the &s;ame time to write and &s;peak well; and among all the other Di|alects the <HI>Attic</HI> there prevailes, in regard that they have not had any Commerce with Foreign Nations, whence proceeds the Corruption of Languages; whereby it comes to pa&s;s, that they have pre&s;erv'd the purity of their own, as have al&s;o &s;ome Villages of <HI>Greece</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> where they &s;peak the pure litteral Greek; for that living at a di&s;tance from the Sea, and in a Country of difficult acce&s;s, they
<PB N="147" REF="88"> enjoy the &s;ame good Fortune. For which, be&s;ides the Te&s;timony of <HI>Davity,</HI> I have al&s;o the Authority of the Reverend and Learned <HI>Pa|pa, Michael</HI> of <HI>Epirus,</HI> who but lately a&s;&s;ur'd me at <HI>Venice,</HI> that he had met with &s;uch in his Travels.</P>
<P>By this time their Judgments being rightly inform'd, they be|come more fit to read Philo&s;ophy, which they learn in the la&s;t place. They have al&s;o their bodily Exer|ci&s;es, being taught at the &s;ame time to handle their Arms both Rapier and Back-&s;word, to &s;hoot with their Bows, and to ride the manag'd Hor&s;e, in a place appointed for that purpo&s;e, where al&s;o are admitted the Manufacture Apprentices. They never teach Logick nor Rhetorick; alledging that tho&s;e two Sciences are as natural to a Man as to goe, or to make u&s;e of his Hands; and that no man can arrive to be an
<PB N="148" REF="89"> exqui&s;ite Logician, or a perfect Orator that has not an excelling Genius that way. However they give their Scholars certain general Precepts, very much agreeing with the Maxims of the <HI>Epicureans.</HI></P>
<P>They al&s;o read and expound in their Schools <HI>Ari&s;totle, Plato, Socra|tes, Epicurus, Democritus, Thales, Di|ogenes,</HI> and all the ancient Philo&s;o|phers, of which we have only the Names; and who&s;e writings they pre&s;erve; leaving to their Scholars to choo&s;e what Opinion they think mo&s;t probable. They al&s;o permit them to read the Poets, though very much incens'd again&s;t them, for their Invention of Fa|bles concerning Deities that never were. For by the Conver&s;e which I had among them I found that their knowledge in Philo&s;ophy was altogether bounded by Sence, which they take for the only Rule
<PB N="149" REF="89"> of their Rea&s;oning, the Extrava|gancies of which are to be mode|rated and corrected by them&s;elves, being per&s;waded that what can|not be apprehended by the Sence, is not at all, nor can be the object of our Meditations. To which when I an&s;wer'd that the contrary was taught in our Schools, that is to &s;ay that Rea&s;on corrected the Sence, they lookt upon it as ridi|culous, as if a Blind man &s;hould go about to correct his Guide.</P>
<P>They generally believe the E|ternity of the fir&s;t matter, not be|ing able to conceive how any thing &s;hould be made out of nothing; that the World with all its varie|ties was produc'd by the &s;ympathy and antipathy of the fir&s;t Body's, which as they had no beginning will have no ending. They make &s;ome Bodies moveable of them|&s;elves; others by the impul&s;e of
<PB N="150" REF="90"> tho&s;e only in a void &s;pace. They acknowledge no other Cau&s;e but one, which is the Material. For all which Opinions of theirs I do not here produce their &s;everal Rea&s;ons, as de&s;igning at pre&s;ent only a Hi|&s;torical Relation; which el&s;e would require a larger Volume by it &s;elf, which perhaps I may here|after put to publick view.</P>
<P>If any one begin to broach new Opinions they cite him before the Council, who examine them, and if they find them ill grounded, the Per&s;on is not commanded to re|cant, but only to hold his Peace, un|der the Penalty of being put into the number of the <HI>Scandalous;</HI> a Li&s;t of who&s;e names is affix'd to the Door of the Temple, there to remain to perpetuity: an afflicti|on, which next to exile, they &s;tand mo&s;t in fear of.</P>
<P>Their Library more &s;pacious than
<PB N="151" REF="90"> the <HI>Vatican,</HI> is &s;o much the more Curious, by how much it is fur|ni&s;h'd with an infinite number of Authors, of which we know not &s;o much as the Names, and &s;uch as liv'd before <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> Tho&s;e they call the ancient Authors; for the Modern they e&s;teem to be tho&s;e that wrote after their &s;ettle|ment, which is above Two thou|&s;and years ago. They &s;hew'd me al&s;o Tran&s;lations of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Books, which make the World to be much more ancient than we be|lieve it to be; our Chronology being no more than a Great Grand Child of theirs.</P>
<P>As for Printing tho' they well know what it is, yet they make no u&s;e of it; &s;o that all their Books are in Munu&s;cript, either in Parch|ment or Paper, in the Greek Lan|guage, in regard they know no other; unle&s;s it be the <HI>Tartarian,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="91"> which by what means &s;ome of them come to under&s;tand I &s;hall relate in due place.</P>
<P>They di&s;tingui&s;h their Books ac|cording to the Quality of the Sub|jects. And if any Author of their own writes any thing new, his Book is not admitted into this No|ble Society of Volums, till it has had the Approbation of the Coun|cil of Thirty: Private Men may have it before, but few care for it till then; &s;o great a veneration they have for the Judgment of that mo&s;t noble A&s;&s;embly, all compo|&s;ed of learned and cho&s;en Men, the flowre of Philo&s;ophers, as are al&s;o the two hunder'd and &s;eventy.</P>
<P>Among the Legi&s;lators, I &s;aw the Pentateuch of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> tran|&s;lated by the care of <HI>Alexander,</HI> and &s;ent to his Ma&s;ter <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> as &s;ome Lines under his own hand, at the end of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> wit|ne&s;s.
<PB N="153" REF="91"> I ask'd them their Senti|ments concerning that Law; to which they an&s;wer'd that they had a great e&s;teem for the Moral part, di&s;lik'd his Sacrifices, condemn'd his Ceremonies, and for his Hi&s;to|rical part, &s;ome they deem'd pro|bable, the re&s;t very improbable: One of the Company added that he was a Philo&s;opher, that he had too enigmatically de&s;crib'd the Generation of the World, and of the Creatures therein to a blocki&s;h &s;ort of People, uncapable to ap|prehend it by methodical Rea&s;on|ing: That he believ'd with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that man was produc'd out of the Earth, and that without doubt he had borrow'd that Opinion from the learning of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> a|mong whom he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to have had his Education.</P>
<P>At length I came to the Book which was left by the <HI>French</HI> man
<PB N="154" REF="92"> of whom I have already made mention. They kept it apart, not knowing where to range it, be|cau&s;e they did not under&s;tand it: I found it to be a New Te&s;tament.

At which they were overjoy'd, and gave me a thou&s;and Thanks.

As for their Climate their own A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations reckon it two and forty Degrees, far from the Equi|noctial Line; and their own Miri|dian is the fir&s;t in their own Maps.</P>
<P>Now tho' they inhabit a Coun|try abounding in all things that may render Life agreeable and commodious, yet they live after a mo&s;t &s;paring and au&s;tere manner. For they affect not the delicious ta&s;tes of Drink or co&s;tly Viands, unle&s;s when they are &s;ick, or make great Banquets, which they never do but only upon certain Occa&s;i|ons, and that very rarely, as at Weddings, the Birth of their Chil|dren,
<PB N="157" REF="93"> Receptions of Strangers or the like, without being thereto con&s;train'd, however by any Laws or Decrees. They eat about &s;ome three hours after they ri&s;e in a Morning; but their chief Meals are in the Evening about three hours before they go to bed. Their Magazins furni&s;h them with cour&s;e Food, Bread and Wine; but for Veni&s;on and Fi&s;h they eat none, but what they hunt and catch them&s;elves, or what their Children &s;end them from their Country Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Their Habit is plain, made of Wooll dy'd of a Violet Colour for the Men, and white for the Wo|men; which is the only di&s;tinction of their two Sexes. As to the fa|&s;hion, it is the &s;ame us'd all along by the Ancients, with a Stole up|on their Shoulders after the man|ner of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to cover them
<PB N="158" REF="94"> in the Country from the Sun, or when they are forc'd to go in the Rain. As to other things, bare|headed and bare footed, only in a Leather Sandal lin'd within &s;ide with Wooll. They that have Jew|els may wear them; and as for the three hunder'd they are di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by their Scarlet habit, which none be&s;ides are allow'd to wear.</P>
<P>There are no profe&s;s'd Phy&s;ici|ans among them, for they all un|der&s;tand Phy&s;ick. 'Tis very true that in difficult Ca&s;es they call a Philo&s;opher, who comes upon the &s;ame Conditions as their Pleaders without any Fee: Their u&s;ual Re|medies they take from Trees, Herbs and Roots growing in their own Grounds, which have the &s;ame Qualities, with Ca&s;&s;ia, Senna, and Scammony, and with which they &s;uddenly cure all Di&s;tempers that are curable. For in regard
<PB N="159" REF="94"> that Noble Science is there pra|ctis'd for no advantage of gain, the Philo&s;opher who is &s;ent for never &s;eeks to prolong the Cure; be&s;ides that making up their Pre&s;crip|tions them&s;elves, they have no|thing to fear on the Apothecaries part, who&s;e Avarice or <HI>qui pro quo</HI> often times does the Patient more injury than the Di&s;temper it &s;elf. There is not a Surgeon nor a Bar|ber to be &s;een, for they never let blood, as not being to be per&s;wad|ed that they ought to wound a Patient to cure him; or that the Blood which is the &s;eat of the Soul, with which it has &s;o &s;trict an Alliance, that it &s;eems to be in&s;e|perable, ought to be &s;pilt to make it better, &s;eeing that which remains in the Body is as bad as before the Blood letting; but that it is better corrected by <HI>Catharticks,</HI> which &s;e|parate from its Ma&s;s the Humours
<PB N="160" REF="95"> which infect it, without taking a|way that which is good, and that the quantity of it may be dimi|ni&s;h'd at any time by Diet, Exer|ci&s;e, and Sweating.</P>
<P>As to Wounds and Brui&s;es, they proceed after the &s;ame method as in Fevers; that is to &s;ay, they cure them&s;elves with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Philo&s;opher if need require.</P>
<P>The Women &s;have and trim their Husbands, of whom they are &s;o jealous, that they will not &s;uffer any bodies hands to come neer their Faces but their own.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophers have al&s;o &s;pe|cific Remedies for the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Soul, the continual u&s;e of which fortifies the Memory and purifies the Wit in &s;uch a manner, that they will make a Dunce Ingenious. It is a Compo&s;ition of which we have the ingredients in this part of the World; and of which I have
<PB N="161" REF="95"> often made u&s;e &s;ince my return into Europe, with good &s;ucce&s;s as well to my &s;elf as to others.

<P>If a &s;ick Per&s;on be given over as pa&s;t recovery, there is no need of a Comforter, becau&s;e they do not conceive there is any evil in death, which they look upon as only a meer Ce&s;&s;ation from Acti|on and Thought, which may po&s;|&s;ibly return one day, if the Par|ticles from whence the &s;ame Acti|on and Thought deriv'd their fir&s;t beginning &s;hould happen to reu|nite. The Children burn the Body of their Parents deceas'd in their
<PB N="162" REF="96"> own Gardens, and &s;catter their A&s;hes upon the Earth; believing that the enlivening Atoms are cha|rioted up in the Flames to their fir&s;t Original, which they believe to be the Sun; and by their mix|ture of the A&s;hes with the Earth, they believe that in eating the Plants which proceed from thence, that they enliven the more gro&s;s and terre&s;trial Portion of their Pa|rents. To &s;peak the truth, I at|tribute the goodne&s;s of the Air which they breath in tho&s;e Parts, partly to this Cu&s;tom, which ren|ders it &s;o free from tho&s;e Infections which the &s;tinking Exhalations of the Bodies interr'd in our Cities are the certain cau&s;e of among us.</P>
<P>In regard their Commerce is not great, 'tis not very po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be Rich. However they are not poor neither; for that the fertility of the Soil furni&s;hes them with all
<PB N="163" REF="96"> things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and plea&s;ure of Life, and to &s;pare. So that they &s;end the &s;uperfluity of their Provi&s;ions and Manufactures once a year to a Fair that is held between the Confines of this State, and the <HI>Great Moguls</HI> Country, where they Barter their Commo|dities for Pearls, Diamonds, and other Precious Stones, or el&s;e for Gold and Silver coyn'd, for the be|nefit of the Publick Trea&s;ure, which &s;urpa&s;&s;es in value tho&s;e of St. <HI>Denis, Loretto</HI> and St. <HI>Mark,</HI> put them altogether tho' they be the Riche&s;t that I have &s;een in Europe. Nor do they prohibit private Per|&s;ons from &s;ending their Goods thi|ther, and Trading upon their own accounts. For after they are out of their times, and have done that Service which is requir'd from them for the Benefit of the Coun|try Farms, or otherwi&s;e, till they
<PB N="164" REF="97"> come to be Thirty years of Age, they have then liberty to work at home, for the Ornament of them|&s;elves and their Hou&s;es. Be&s;ides, that whatever they do for the Ser|vice of the Commonwealth is &s;ure to be publickly rewarded; and with this wealth, either purchas'd by their Indu&s;try or their Vertue, they fea&s;t and give Portions to their Children when they marry them.</P>
<P>Now altho' they lye &s;urrounded by the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> yet are they not at War with any body: For the Great <HI>Kam,</HI> who has always had a high e&s;teem for them, by rea&s;on of their Integrity, permits them to live in Peace and Tranquillity one among another. In acknow|ledgment of which favour, they furni&s;h him at all times with a &s;mall Regiment of 300. Men, under Thirty years of Age, who go to &s;erve him voluntarily, and all the
<PB N="165" REF="97"> time that they &s;tay there, is lookt upon as if they had &s;pent it in the Service of the State. The&s;e 300 choo&s;e them&s;elves their own Colo|nel, who &s;wears fidelity to the Great <HI>Kam;</HI> who at his fir&s;t arri|val pre&s;ents him with very fair Arms and Weapons, and gives him leave to make choice of &s;ix Leiutenants, to Command every one under him Fifty Men a peice. Nor do they ever return from his Service without a con&s;iderable Re|ward; and they that &s;ignalize them|&s;elves by any extraordinary At|chievement, are rewarded moreo|ver according to their Merit. Thus it is that they come to under&s;tand the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Language, of which the People of this Country make u&s;e in their Commerce by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of one or two of the&s;e In|terpreters, who are deputed by the Council to attend the Fair.
<PB N="166" REF="98"> When they are ready to March to the Great <HI>Kam,</HI> the Council gives them an Order to take Arms out of the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> which is al|ways furni&s;h'd to Arm Sixty thou|&s;and Men upon occa&s;ion. Their Offen&s;ive Arms are a Bow, a Sci|mitar, a Mace of Iron, a Javelin, and a Pike; their Defen&s;ive only a Buckler and a Helmet.</P>
<P>All the while that I convers'd with them I could not find that they had any Notion of God after our manner; in regard that as I have &s;aid, their Philo&s;ophy &s;olely depends upon Sence. As for tho&s;e Deities which either Poetry, Fear, or Imagination has &s;et up, they are too wi&s;e to acknowledg; &s;o that I have nothing to &s;ay concerning their Religion, except you call Religion that which they believe and practi&s;e concerning the Sun.</P>

They are per&s;waded that it is the Soul of the World, and that the Beams of the Sun being incorporated into the Creatures give motion to their Corporeal Ma&s;s, the external Fi|gure of which makes the Princi|pal difference which we &s;ee be|tween them. Tho' they do not deny but that their different In|ternal Operations may proceed as well from the variety of little Bodies, with which they are mix'd, as from the Beams of the Sun more or le&s;s purify'd. They a&s;&s;ert the Sun to be a Globe of Fire exactly rarify'd, and &s;hining in the Center of the World, as being the heart which animates all the Parts of it; and the Element or Principle of Souls to which they all return up|on their &s;eperation from the Body,

Their Di&s;putes contain no|thing of the Pedantick, there is not to be heard <HI>I deny your Major,</HI> or <HI>I

<P>As to their Ponunciation it a|grees with that of our Criticks; in which they differ from our <HI>Euro|pian</HI> Greeks; and I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o to turn over the Books of &s;everal Ancient Philo&s;ophers, which we want, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which, though fal&s;ly, is laid to the charge of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Ambition. By the reading of which I found the Mode&s;ty of tho&s;e Great Men, who never a&s;&s;erted their Opinions like Arrogant Dogmati&s;ts, but only as Doubts, or as An&s;wers which to them &s;eem'd probable, in &s;atisfacti|on of the Que&s;tions which were to

<P>Among their Authors of <HI>My|thology</HI> I found the <HI>Greek</HI> New Te&s;tament which I had pre&s;ented them. Of which I demanded the Rea&s;on from the Library Keeper: who an&s;wer'd me, That he had ob&s;erv'd mo&s;t excellent Precepts of Morality therein; but by rea&s;on of a Cele&s;tial Genealogy, and &s;ome other particulars, that did not &s;eem rationably to be believ'd, he had rank'd it among tho&s;e Vo|lumes, by advice of his Council compos'd of Four other Philo&s;o|phers, deputed as he was, by the
<PB N="179" REF="104"> Thirty. Thereupon I took an oc|ca&s;ion to unfold to them the Prin|ciples of the Chri&s;tian Religion, &s;o univer&s;ally believ'd by the Princes and Potentates of Europe; how|ever without making any progre&s;s among them, becau&s;e I had to do with People that acknowledg'd no other Authority but that of Sence and Rea&s;on, which cannot appre|hend the My&s;teries of Faith. But when I came to tell them of one Nature in three Per&s;ons, of two Natures in one Per&s;on, and one invi&s;ible incorporeal Deity, who was All in All, and All in every Part; born in a Stable, Crucify'd upon a Cro&s;s, and reproducing him&s;elf every day in a thou&s;and Parts of the World to be &s;wallow'd by his Adorers, they began to di&s;|cour&s;e among them&s;elves that I was frantick, and talk'd already of &s;end|ing me among the mad Folks, &s;o

<P>If there be &s;uch a God, &s;aid one to me, as you de&s;cribe, who would be Wor&s;hipt by all the Earth ac|cording to the Religion which you propo&s;e, and that this Faith is the only way to gain Heaven, and &s;hun everla&s;ting Torment, it had become his Wi&s;dom, his Goodne&s;s and his Omnipotency, to have caus'd it to have been divulg'd a|broad at fir&s;t through all the Uni|ver&s;e, after the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t intelligible manner imaginable, to prevent the ruin of &s;o many Men who have peri&s;h'd according to your Principles, for the&s;e &s;ixteen Centuries pa&s;t, becau&s;e they never heard of any &s;uch thing. In&s;tead of expo&s;ing an Innocent Son to the &s;everity of Torment, he &s;hould have &s;ent him into the World with an Equipage an&s;werable to his
<PB N="181" REF="105"> Birth, that he might have been heard with more re&s;pect; with an Army to render him formidable; and with Lightning in his hand to terrifie tho&s;e that would not obey his Law.

Where is that Judge, reply'd my Antagoni&s;t, that would condemn an Innocent Son for the &s;ake of Criminals? e|&s;pecially it being in his &s;ole and only Power to &s;ave by a meer amni&s;ty.

I mu&s;t confe&s;s I made a Propo&s;ition to <HI>Eugenes</HI> and &s;ome o|thers, to have taken a Journey in|to <HI>Europe;</HI> but they very frankly told me, That there was not any thing which I had related to them, concerning our Parts of the World that bred in them the lea&s;t Inclina|tion to undergo &s;o great a trouble. Upon that I pre&s;ented my Friend with an Emrald &s;orrounded with Diamonds; and he pre&s;ented me with the Works of <HI>Democritus,</HI> and <HI>Thales</HI> the <HI>Mile&s;ian,</HI> together with a certain Stone, which our Lapidaries know not what to make of. After that taking leave of my Friend upon the Frontiers, whe|ther he had accompany'd me, as well out of friend&s;hip, as by the Orders of the Thirty, in hopes to &s;ee each other again, I betook my &s;elf to the Conduct of my <HI>Tartar,</HI> who taking a neerer but more dif|ficult
<PB N="184" REF="107"> way than what I had travell'd before, gave me opportunity of &s;eeing &s;everal Countries, not much unlike tho&s;e Beautiful and Charm|ing Glooms that adorn the <HI>Alpes</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> of which I intend to give a De&s;cription, if the&s;e my pre&s;ent Travels find a favourable reception.</P>
<P>In &s;ix Weeks time I came to a Village by the Sea-&s;ide, where to comfort me for the lo&s;s of <HI>Eugenes,</HI> I had the happine&s;s to meet with <HI>Monthre&s;or,</HI> who after the u&s;ual Embraces, and Tender Expre&s;&s;i|ons, which &s;uch an unexpected meeting could invent, gave me an accompt, how that after he had been carry'd away by the impetu|o&s;ity of the Current, he enter'd into a deep Water, &s;alt and &s;till; which made him believe him&s;elf to be in the Sea, where he often lanch'd him&s;elf forth according to
<PB N="185" REF="107"> the Art of &s;wimming; that at fir&s;t he found &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance at the top, which made him &s;wim between the two Waters, darting him&s;elf forth withal the &s;trength he could, till at length he gain'd the Shore of the Sea that wa&s;hes this Coa&s;t. I ask'd him what he &s;aw remarkable under that &s;ame <HI>Tartarian Pau&s;illipus.</HI> To which he an&s;wer'd that by the thick darkne&s;s of that dreadful Cave, tho' it were at Noon day, he could make no Ob&s;ervation by his &s;ight, but that his Ears were ter|rify'd with a Horrid Whi&s;tling, of which he had no time to examin the Rea&s;on, in regard his Thoughts were all employ'd how to &s;ave him&s;elf. After that we made a Re|lation one to another of our pa&s;t Adventures, while we &s;taid to em|bark in a Fi&s;her-boat, like tho&s;e of <HI>Marteguois,</HI> and &s;o &s;wift that it brought us to <HI>Santa Maria</HI> in four
<PB N="186" REF="108"> days, from whence we held the &s;ame Cour&s;e backward as we had done forward.</P>
<P>Returning through <HI>Athens</HI> I vi|&s;ited my Ho&s;t <HI>Epiphanes,</HI> who re|ceiv'd me with a great deal of joy, returning me a thou&s;and thanks for the good Effects of my <HI>Antipo|dagricon,</HI> finding him&s;elf ab&s;olute|ly freed from the Tormenting pains of the Gout by the u&s;e of it. And I &s;hould have been much more glad to find my &s;elf &s;o In&s;trumen|tal in the Recovery of a Per&s;on from whom I had receiv'd &s;o much kindne&s;s, had not my Joy been a|bated by the news which I receiv'd at the &s;ame time of the death of <HI>Demetrius</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Athens</HI> I had a de&s;ign to have taken a Journey to <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> but under&s;tanding I &s;hould &s;ee no|thing but a Mountain, like to o|ther Hills, with out any Foot&s;teps
<PB N="187" REF="108"> of Antiquity, I laid a&s;ide tho&s;e thoughts. For I am not of the hu|mour of many Men that put them|&s;elves to a great deal of trouble, meerly that they may be able to &s;ay they have been at &s;uch or &s;uch a place when mention'd in Company. If the Beauties of a Country do not draw me thither, there mu&s;t be at lea&s;t &s;ome remainder of tho&s;e that formerly inhabited tho&s;e Parts, whence I may in &s;ome mea|&s;ure under&s;tand the Fa&s;hions of Li|ving, and Cu&s;toms of a People whom Hi&s;tory has repre&s;ented to the World with Applau&s;e; nor is the knowledge of the Manners and Cu&s;toms of the pre&s;ent Inhabi|tants, able to make a Parallel be|tween them and their ance&s;tors un|worthy a Man of Wit; and there|fore above all things I flye to a place where once Learning flou|ri&s;h'd.

<P>From <HI>Athens</HI> we return'd to <HI>Na|ples,</HI> who&s;e delicious Climate con|&s;train'd <HI>Monthre&s;or</HI> to &s;top there. For my own part I return'd into <HI>France,</HI> where after I had experi|mented all the Rigours of a Cruel Fortune, in the year 1676, I em|bark'd at <HI>Rochel</HI> in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;|&s;el, which brought me to <HI>Plymouth</HI> the 28th. of <HI>September,</HI> having a de&s;ire to terminate my Travels and my days in this Kingdom. But the Enemy of my repo&s;e would &s;uffer me to take no re&s;t, having
<PB N="189" REF="109"> found out new nece&s;&s;ities for me to revi&s;it as well <HI>France,</HI> as &s;everal o|ther parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> through Roads not common, where I have made &s;everal Remarks, which I &s;hall communicate to Publick view, when I under&s;tand what kind of entertainment this my fir&s;t Volume has receiv'd: For nature not be|ing wholly &s;hut up in one &s;mall Corner, it behoves a Philo&s;opher to &s;ound for Experience in various Parts, which he cannot otherwi&s;e do than by Travelling; el&s;e the Company of Learned Men and rare Wits, which are in Kingdoms and Countries like &s;o many <HI>Phoe|nixes,</HI> is not to be acquir'd, but by a &s;trict &s;urvey of tho&s;e Kingdoms. And indeed by the means of the&s;e two a&s;&s;i&s;tances it was, that I found what I &s;ought for in the Study of Philo&s;ophy, which of all the Stu|dies I have labour'd in, even to the maintaining of General The&s;es, con|cerning

Be|&s;ides that the exact knowledge of the Body of Man, which &s;he promi|&s;es her followers, making me hope that &s;he would favour my de&s;igns of diving into the Secrets of Na|ture, bred in me a &s;trong Inclina|tion from that time forward to ap|ply my &s;elf devoutly to that Sci|ence. And the Progre&s;s which I made both in the one and the o|ther &s;eem'd &s;ufficient to my Friends to importune me to take the De|gree of Doctor in both Faculties.
