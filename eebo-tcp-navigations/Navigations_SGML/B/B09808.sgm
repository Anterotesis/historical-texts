<OPENER><SALUTE>Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur coming here according to the Cu&s;tome of your Ance&s;tors, to Condole the death of your <HI>Brethren</HI> Mur|thered at <HI>Shennechtady</HI> is very acceptable, whereby your Inclination towards us is Demon&s;trated; we mu&s;t acknowledg that they did not keep &s;o good Watch as they ought, con&s;idering what a fal&s;e and deceitful Enemy they had to deal withal, but that which made them &s;o &s;ecure, was, the great Tru&s;t which they Repo&s;ed in the forty <HI>Maqua&s;s</HI> who came here, and Tendered their Service to go and be the Out-watch, and to &s;py the Enemy: To which end Powder and Lead
<PB N="6" REF="8"> was given them as they de&s;ired; we were about Hiring Chri|&s;tians to &s;end thither, but were unhappily diverted by the &s;aid Company of <HI>Maqua&s;s,</HI> who promi&s;ed to have four Po&s;ts ready, two to go to their own Country, and two to come hither if a|ny Enemy &s;hould appear. For the Brethren did a&s;&s;ure us, that no <HI>French</HI> could come here without being Di&s;covered; and then would all fall into our hands: We are likewi&s;e mindful, how that the five Nations la&s;t <HI>Fall,</HI> when the Gentlemen of <HI>New-England</HI> were here did Declare how they would Encompa&s;s the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> that they could not break out this Winter, without being Di&s;covered and Fallen upon: We did likewi&s;e propo&s;e by our Me&s;&s;engers, <HI>Arnout,</HI> and <HI>Robert Sanders</HI> at the General Meeting of <HI>Onnondage</HI> to have Three or Four Hundred Men &s;ent hither to be ready on all occa&s;ions, but &s;ee none.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> this Evil is done and cannot be called back again, and the only means to prevent the like for the future, is to keep good Watch, and to have good courage to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t the Enemy. We are no wayes Di&s;comfited for this mi&s;|fortune. It is the fortune of War, we do not fear to be even with the <HI>French</HI> in a &s;hort time; we have already &s;ent Let|ters to all our Neighbours of <HI>New-England, Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> the Subjects of the great King of <HI>England,</HI> and acquainted them of the <HI>Evil</HI> done here by the <HI>French,</HI> and how requi&s;ite it is, that Ships be fitted out with all convenient &s;peed, to go to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> and to pre&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s the more, we do now &s;end per&s;ons to <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> a purpo&s;e to lay open the Ca&s;e before them. And to per&s;wade them to Rig out Ve&s;|&s;els not only to hinder Succour coming from <HI>France,</HI> but to take <HI>Quebeck</HI> it &s;elf: as al&s;o to &s;end more Men hither, that we may then &s;end Men along with you to annoy the Enemy in their Country In the mean time we recommend the <HI>Brethren</HI> to &s;end for
<PB N="7" REF="8"> <HI>two hundred Men</HI> from the upper Nations, to joyn with you, to keep the <HI>French</HI> in continual Alarm, and do them what mi&s;chief imaginable; and <HI>Onnondages</HI> and <HI>Sinnekes</HI> mu&s;t go down the Ri|ver of <HI>Cadarachqui,</HI> and meet one another about <HI>Mont Royal,</HI> and annoy the Enemy there: we &s;hall in the mean while Fortifie the Town, and put our &s;elves in a good po&s;ture of Defence, that we may not be Surprized, as they of <HI>Shennechtady</HI> were; and make all Preparations to oppo&s;e the Enemy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brethren</HI> &s;ee that we are in War with <HI>France,</HI> now there is no time to &s;peak of Peace. The <HI>French</HI> as you well ob&s;erve have fallen on both ends of the Chain, but not broke it. Let us keep the Covenant &s;o much the fa&s;ter, which never has had the lea&s;t crack &s;ince the very fir&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> came here: They &s;trove to lull us as all a&s;leep, by their Me&s;&s;engers at <HI>Onnondage,</HI> &s;peaking of Peace, and then they were upon the way, hither to commit this Murther.</P>
<P>&rindx; The <HI>Brethren</HI> need not fear for a <HI>Ce&s;&s;ation</HI> to hinder us to pur&s;ue the Enemy, for as we told you before, the KING that ordered <HI>that,</HI> was a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and a great Friend of the <HI>French;</HI> But our pre&s;ent Great KING will pur&s;ue the War to the outmo&s;t: Therefore we mu&s;t all prepare for War. It will therefore be very requi&s;ite that the <HI>Brethren</HI> for their better Security come and Plant this Summer at <HI>Shinnechtady</HI> upon the Land that can|not be cultivated this year, that we may be near to one another upon any occa&s;ion. Concerning the Propo&s;ition of the <HI>Shackkook</HI> Indians, 'tis concluded on &s;ome dayes ago, to propo&s;e to the <HI>Shack|kook</HI> Indians the Planting on <HI>Marte Gerrit&s;e</HI> I&s;land hard by the Town, and the River Indians that live below &s;hall al&s;o come to|gether to be ready on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t In&s;i&s;t and Recommend you to per&s;wade them of <HI>Oneyde</HI> to &s;end the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> hither, for you have &s;een how dangerous
<PB N="8" REF="9"> it is to have &s;uch per&s;ons among you, who informs the Enemy of all your doings, and di&s;covers all our De&s;igns, we &s;hall &s;ecure him that he Run not away, and when the Owner demands him, and the&s;e Troubles are over, &s;hall be Delivered, for he can do more harm in <HI>Oneyde</HI> than an hundred men.</P>
<P>We think it Convenient that one or two of the <HI>Sachims</HI> &s;tay here, and that a <HI>Sachim</HI> of each Nation be here to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the management of the Affairs of the War. There was given them &s;ix Belts or <HI>Wam|pom,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Duffils,</HI> Tobacco, and &s;ome Bags with Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>After the Propo&s;ition was an&s;wered, they gave a Shout according to their Cu&s;tome, which &s;ignified <HI>Amen,</HI> that they would continue the War to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>After the &s;aid An&s;wer was made, The <HI>Maquas Sachems</HI> &s;aid after they had Repeated our An&s;wer. We are glad to &s;ee that you are not Di&s;couraged, A mi&s;take can be made by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men, and we mu&s;t &s;ee now to Pur&s;ue the War with all Vigour, we have an hundred men out in Pur&s;uit of the Enemy &s;till, who are good Skouts; in the mean time, we expect all the <HI>Sachims</HI> of the Upper Nations to Con&s;ult with us, who will come to Condole the Death of our <HI>Bre|thren</HI> Murthered at <HI>Shennechtady:</HI> You need not fear our being Rea|dy, we are &s;oon fitted out, our Ax is in our hand. But take care for your &s;elves to be in Readine&s;s. The Ships that mu&s;t do the principal work are long a Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ting out and Rigging; we do not De&s;ign to go out with a &s;mall Troop as Skouts, but as &s;oon as the Nations come together; we will go with a whole Army to Ruine the Coun|try. The Bui&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be &s;oon brought to a Period; therefore &s;end in all ha&s;te to <HI>New-England,</HI> for we nor you cannot live long in this Condition; we mu&s;t order it &s;o, that the <HI>French</HI> be in a continual Fear and Alarm, and that is the way to be in Peace here.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Shakkook</HI> Indians in our Opinion they lye well where they are, as a good Watch, They are our Children, we will take care that they do their Duty, but as for the <HI>Indians</HI> that live be|low the Town, Them we mean mu&s;t be &s;ent for up, and got to Plant and live together, to be always in Readine&s;s upon occa&s;ion.</P>
