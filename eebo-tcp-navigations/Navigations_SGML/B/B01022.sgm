<HEAD>Captaine Carleills di&s;cour&s;e</HEAD>
<P>_WHen the Gold&s;mith de&s;ireth to finde the certaine goodne&s;&s;e of a peece of golde, which is newly offered vnto hym, he pre|&s;ently bryngeth the &s;ame to the Touch|&s;tone: whereby comparyng the &s;howe or touche of this newe peece with the touch or &s;hewe of that whiche he knoweth of olde, he forthwith is able to iudge what the valewe is of that, which is newly offered vnto hym. After the ex&s;ample wherof I haue thought it good to make &s;ome briefe repetition of the perticuler e&s;tate of many other forraine Voyages and trades alreadie frequented and knowne vnto vs, wherby you maie be the better able to conceiue and iudge what certaine likeli|hood of good there is to be expected in the Voyage, whiche is pre&s;ently reco~mended vnto your knowledge and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t to laie doune that of <HI>Mo&s;couia,</HI> who&s;e beginnyng is yet in the remembrance of many. It is well knowne that what by the charges of the fir&s;t di&s;couerie, and by the greate giftes be&s;towed on the Emperor and his Nobilitie, together with the leaud dealing of &s;ome their &s;eruauntes, who thought them&s;elues &s;afe enough from orderly puni&s;hment. It co&s;t the Companie aboue fower &s;kore thou&s;ande poundes, before it could be brought to any profitable reckoning. And now that after &s;o long a pacience, and &s;o greate a burthen of expences. the &s;ame beganne to frame to &s;ome good cour&s;e and commo|dity: It faleth to very tickli&s;h tearmes, and to as &s;lender like|lihood of any further goodne&s;&s;e as any other trade that may be named. For fir&s;t the e&s;tate of tho&s;e Countreis and the Em|perours dealinges, are thinges more fickle then are by euery bodie vnder&s;toode. Next, the Dutchmen are there &s;o crept in, as thei daiely augment their trade thether, which maie well confirme that vncertentie of the Emperours di&s;po&s;ition to keepe promi&s;e with our Nation. Thirdly, the qualitie of the voyage, &s;uche as it may not bee performed but once the yere. Fourthly, the charges of all Amba&s;&s;adours betweene that Prince &amp; her Maie&s;tie, are alwaies borne by the Marchants
<PB REF="2" MS="y">&s;tocke. And la&s;tly, the daunger of the Kyng of Denmarke, who be&s;ides that pre&s;ently he is like to enforce a tribute on vs, hath likewi&s;e an aduauntage vpon our Shippes in their voyage, either homewardes or outwardes when&s;oeuer he li|&s;teth to take the opportunitie.</P>
<P>The bad dealynges of the E&s;terlynges are &s;ufficiently knowne to be &s;uche towardes our Marchaunts of that trade, as thei doe not onely offer them many iniuries ouerlong to be written, but doe &s;eeke all the meanes thei can, to depriue them wholy of their occupiyng that waie: and to the &s;ame purpo&s;e haue of late, cleane debarred them their accu&s;tomed and auncient priuileges in all their greate Townes.</P>
<P>The traffiques into Turkie, be&s;ides that by &s;ome it is thought a harde poinct to haue &s;o muche familiarity with the profe&s;&s;ed and ob&s;tinate Enemie of Chri&s;t: It is likewi&s;e a voyage whiche can not bee made but at the deuotion, and as it were in the daunger of many States, who for &s;ondrie re|&s;pectes are apt to quarrell with vs vppon &s;udden occa&s;ions. And the pre&s;entes to be giuen awaie in Turkie this yere co&s;t litle le&s;&s;e then two thou&s;ande poundes.</P>
<P>As for the trades into all the partes of Italie, it maie ea&s;e|ly be con&s;idered by euery one of iudgement, that the &s;ame &s;ta~|deth in the like termes touching the pa&s;&s;ages, as that of Tur|kie, and that many tymes our Shippes beeyng taken in the waie by the <HI>Galleis</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> our poore Mariners after the lo&s;&s;e of their goodes and trauaile, are &s;ett at &s;uche exce&s;&s;iue Rau~&s;omes before thei can be freed of their &s;lauerie: as for the mo&s;t parte thei are no way able to di&s;charge: as for Example at this in&s;taunt there are &s;ome pri&s;oners poore ordinary Ma|riners, for who&s;e relea&s;ing there mu&s;t be paied two hundred Duckets the man, for &s;ome three hundred, yea, fower or fiue hu~dred Duckets the man for &s;ome of the~. And how enuiou&s;ly thei doe already oppo&s;e them &s;elues again&s;t our frequenting into their partes, maie appeare by the late cu&s;tomes which thei haue impo&s;ed a&s;well vppon our Engli&s;h Marchaundize whiche wee bryng them, as al&s;o vpon &s;uche their Marchaun|dize
<PB REF="3">whiche we fetche from them.</P>
<P>The trade into <HI>Barbury</HI> groweth likewi&s;e to wor&s;e tear|mes then before tymes: and when it was at the be&s;t our Mar|chauntes haue beene in daunger of all their goodes thei had there, when&s;oeuer it happened the Ryng to die. For vntill a new were cho&s;e~, the liberty of al di&s;cordered per&s;ons is &s;uch, as thei &s;poile &amp; wro~g who~ thei li&s;t without any redre&s;&s;e at al.</P>
<P>Touchyng Spaine and Portugall, with whom wee haue very greate trade, and muche the greater, by meanes of their ventyng a good parte of our wares into their <HI>Jndies,</HI> as al&s;o of the proui&s;ion thei haue from the &s;ame, wherwith are made manye of our returnes from them againe. It falleth out that twi&s;e the yere ordinarily we &s;ende our Flates into tho&s;e par|tes: So that when&s;oeuer the Ryng of Spaine li&s;teth to take the opportunity, he maie at the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons depriue vs not only of a greate nomber of our very good Shippes, but al&s;o of our hone&s;te&s;t, and able&s;t &s;ort of Marriners that are to be found in our whole Realme againe: which is a matter of no &s;mall con|&s;equence: for it is to bee noted, that when he &s;hall take a quar|rell in hande, though it be but his owne perticulerly, yet hath he the meanes to put in hazarde a&s;well tho&s;e our Shippes which are in his owne Countreis of Spaine and Portugall, as al&s;o all others whiche &s;hall be bounde to any the partes of all Italie or of Turkie either. And further who&s;oeuer he bee that is but &s;o meanly affected in Religion, as of nece&s;&s;itie be|commeth euery ordinarie man and good Chri&s;tian to be, can not but be agreeued in his harte to con&s;ider, that his children and &s;eruaunts whom he de&s;ireth to haue well brought vp, are in the&s;e trades of Spaine and Portugall and all Italie, for|ced to deny their owne profe&s;&s;ion, and made to acquaint them &s;elues with that which the Parentes and Mai&s;ters doe vtter|ly denie and refu&s;e, yea which many of them doe in their own hartes abhorre as a dete&s;table and mo&s;t wicked doctrine.</P>
<P>But who &s;hall looke into the quality of this voyage, beyng directed to the latitude of <HI>40.</HI> degrees, or there aboutes of that hithermo&s;t part of <HI>America,</HI> &s;hal finde it hath as many poinc|tes
<PB REF="3" MS="y">of good moment belonging vnto it, as may almo&s;t be wi|&s;hed for. As fir&s;t it is to be vnder&s;toode, that it is not any long cour&s;e, for it may be performed to and from fower monethes, after the fir&s;t di&s;couery thereof: Secondly, that one wind &s;uf|fi&s;eth to make the pa&s;&s;age; wheras mo&s;t of your other voya|ges of like length, are &s;ubiect to three or fower winds. Third|lie, that it is to be performed at all tymes of the yere. Fo|werthly, that the pa&s;&s;age is vpon the high &s;ea, wherby you are not bound to the knowledge of daungers, on any other coa&s;t, more then of that Countrey, and of ours here at home. Fift|lie, that tho&s;e partes of Englande and Irelande, whiche lye apte&s;t for the proceedyng outward, or homeward vpon this voyage, are verie well &s;tored of goodlie Harbourghes. Sixt|ly, that it is to be accompted of no daunger at al, as touching the power of any foraine Prince or State, when it is compa|red with any the be&s;t of all the other voyages before recited.</P>
<P>And to the godlie mynded, it hath this comfortable com|moditie, that in this trade, their Factours, bee thei their &s;er|uauntes or children, &s;hall haue no in&s;truction or confe&s;&s;ions of Idolatrous Religion enforced vpon them, but contrarily &s;hall bee at their free libertie of con&s;cience, and &s;hall finde the &s;ame Religion exerci&s;ed, whiche is mo&s;t agreable vnto their parentes and Mai&s;ters</P>
<P>As for the Merchandizyng, whiche is the matter e&s;peci|ally looked for, albeit that for the pre&s;ent, we are not certain|ly able to promi&s;e any &s;uche like quantitie, as is now at the be&s;t tyme of the <HI>Mo&s;couian</HI> trade brought from thence: So likewi&s;e is there not demaunded any &s;uche proportion of dai|ly expences, as was at the fir&s;t, and as yet is con&s;umed in that of <HI>Mo&s;couia</HI> and other. But when this of <HI>America</HI> &s;hall haue been haunted and practized, thirtie yeres to an ende, as the o|ther hath been, I doubte not by Gods grace, that for the tenne Shippes, that are now commonly employed once the yere into <HI>Mo&s;couia,</HI> there &s;hall in this voyage twi&s;e tenne be im|ployed well, twi&s;e the yere at the lea&s;t. And if for the pre&s;ent tyme, there dooe fall out nothyng els to bee founde, then the
<PB REF="4">bare Fi&s;hyng, yet doubte I not after the fir&s;t yeres planting, but by that matter only to &s;erue half a dozen of your be&s;t &s;ort of &s;hippes, although my &s;upplie of people doe not followe me &s;o &s;ub&s;tancially, as in all rea&s;on maie be well looked for.</P>
<P>But when it is a&s;ked what maie bee hoped from thence af|ter &s;ome yeres, it is fir&s;t to bee con&s;idered, that this &s;ituation in <HI>40.</HI> degrees, &s;halbe verie apte to gather the commodities, either of tho&s;e partes whiche &s;tande to the Southward of it, as al&s;o of tho&s;e whiche are to the Northward.</P>
<P>In the Northerlie maie be expected, not onely an e&s;peciall good fi&s;hing for Salmon, Codde, and Whales, but al&s;o any other &s;uche co~modities, as the Ea&s;terne Countre is doe yeeld vs now: as Pitche, Tarre, Hempe, and therof Cordage, Ma|&s;tes, Lo&s;&s;he hides, riche Furres, and other &s;uche like, without beyng in any &s;ort beholdyng to a Kyng of Denmarke, or o|ther Prince or State, that &s;halbe in &s;uch &s;ort able to co~maund our &s;hippes at their plea&s;ure, as tho&s;e dooe at this daie, by meanes of their &s;traight, pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;trong Shippyng.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e partes which lye We&s;t, and to the Southwar|des, it maie well be hoped thei will yeeld wines with a &s;mall helpe, &s;ince the grapes doe grow there of them&s;elues already very faire, and in great abundance. Oliues beyng once plan|ted, will yeeld the like Oile as Spain and Italy. The Coun|trey people beyng made to know, that for Waxe and Honie, we will giue them &s;uche triflyng thynges, as thei de&s;ire of vs, and &s;hewyng them once the meanes, how to prouide the &s;ame, the labour thereof beyng &s;o light, no doubt but in &s;hort tyme thei will earne&s;tly care to haue the &s;ame in good quan|titie for vs. Be&s;ides what greate likelihoode there is of good meanes to make Salt, which may &s;erue for y^e fi&s;hing of tho&s;e partes, maie well enough appeare vnto them, who can iudge the quality of &s;uch places, as are required to make y^e &s;ame in.</P>
<P>Thus muche for the beginnyng, becau&s;e thei may be had with an ea&s;ie kinde of trauaill. But when it maie haue plea|&s;ed God, to e&s;tabli&s;he our people there any &s;uche tyme, as thei maie haue planted amonge&s;te them, in &s;ondrie partes of the
<PB REF="4">Countrey, and that by gentle and familiar entreatyng them, thei bee made to &s;ee, what is better for them, then thei doe as yet vnder&s;tande of, and that in &s;o many &s;ortes of occa&s;ious, as were infinite to be &s;et doune. It is to be a&s;&s;uredly hoped, that thei will daiely by little &amp; little, for&s;ake their barbarous, and &s;auage liuyng, and grow to &s;uche order and ciuilitie with vs, as there maie be wel expected from thence no le&s;&s;e quantitie, and diuer&s;ity of Marchandize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is &s;poke~ vpon the o|pinion which by &s;ome is conceiued that Irelande is not &s;uffeted to be redu|ced to that perfection whiche it might be, lea&s;t one dai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> by chaunce reuoltyng fro~ the Crowne it might proue an ouer&s;tro~g partie to be &s;o nere an e|nemie vnto England.</NOTE> then is now had out of Dutch|lande, Italie, Fraunce, or Spaigne. And as the borderyng neighbours, are commonly the apte&s;t to fall out with vs, &s;o the&s;e partes, beyng &s;omewhat further remote, are the liker to take, or giue le&s;&s;e occa&s;ion of di&s;quiet. But when it is con&s;ide|red, that thei are our owne kindred, and e&s;teemed our owne Countrey Nation whiche haue the gouernement: meanyng by tho&s;e who &s;halbe there planted, who ca~looke for any other then the dealyng of mo&s;t louing, and mo&s;te a&s;&s;ured freendes.</P>
<P>There are further to be con&s;idered, the&s;e twoo pointes of good importaunce, concernyng the matter of trade. The one is, that by the good pro&s;peryng of this action, there mu&s;te of nece&s;&s;itie fall out, a verie liberall vtteraunce of our Engli&s;he Clothes, into a maine Countrey, de&s;cribed to be bigger then all <HI>Europe,</HI> the larger parte whereof bendyng to the North|ward, &s;hall haue wonderfull greate v&s;e of our &s;aied Engli&s;he Clothes, after thei &s;hall ouce come to knowe the commoditie therof. The like will be al&s;o of many other thinges, ouerma|ny to be reconed, which are made here by our Artificers &amp; la|bouryng people, and of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be prouided fro~ hence.</P>
<P>The other is, if there bee any po&s;&s;ible meanes, to finde a Sea pa&s;&s;age, or other fre&s;he water cour&s;e, whiche mate &s;erue in &s;ome rea&s;onable and conuenient &s;orte, to tran&s;porte our Marchandize into the Ea&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, through any of the&s;e Northerly partes of <HI>America,</HI> it &s;halbe &s;one&s;t and mo&s;te a&s;|&s;uredly performed by the&s;e who &s;hall inhabite, and fir&s;t grow into familiaritie with the Inlande people.</P>
<P>What Minerall matter maie fall out to be founde, is a thing lea&s;t in &s;u&s;pence, vntil &s;ome better knowledge, becau&s;e
<PB REF="5">there be many menne, who hauing long &s;ince, expected &s;ome profites herein, vpon the great promi&s;es that haue been made them, and beyng as yet in no poincte &s;ati&s;fied, doe therevpon conceiue, that thei bee but woordes pourpo&s;ely ca&s;te out, for the inducyng of menne to bee the more willyng to furni&s;he their money, towardes the charge of the fir&s;t di&s;couerie.</P>
<P>But now to aun&s;were &s;ome others, who beginne with an other obiection, &s;aiyng: That it is not for the Marchauntes pur&s;e, to continue the charges of tran&s;portyng and plantyng: and that &s;ince the&s;e hundred menne, whiche are now to bee planted, will co&s;te fower thou&s;ande pounde, it is then to bee thought, that the charge of a farre greater nomber, will be al|&s;o a farre greater &s;ome of money. Wherevnto I aun&s;were, that in all atemptes vnknowne, e&s;pecially &s;uche a one as is this, wherewith wee are pre&s;ently in hande, the fir&s;t charges are commonly aduentured in more de&s;perate kind, then tho&s;e that folowe vppon &s;ome better knowledge: and therewith it falleth out, that whereas one aduentureth in the fir&s;te enter|pri&s;e, an hundred for that one will of them&s;elues bee willyng, and de&s;irous to aduenture in the next, if there be neuer &s;o lit|tle more apparaunce, that the entended matter is by &s;ome knowledge of our owne, found true in &s;ome poinctes of our fir&s;te pre&s;umption.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ewer of Mettall brought by Mai&s;ter Fro|bi&s;her, cau&s;ed two &s;euerall Supplies tho two yeares next follo|wyng, where|of the latter was of xiiij. tall Shippes.</NOTE> The examples are many, and maie ea&s;ily bee remembred by tho&s;e who bee Marchantes, euen in their ordinarie and daiely trades, as well as in extraordinarie at|temptes, whiche of late yeres haue fallen into tho&s;e tearmes of &s;ome likelihoode, as is aboue &s;aied. So then no doubt, but when certaine reportes &s;halbe brought by them, who directly come from thence: that &s;uch a Cou~trey and people, thei haue them&s;elues &s;een, as is by vs &s;poke~ of, but that then there will come forwarde a greater nomber of tho&s;e, who now neither haue hard any thing of the matter, as al&s;o of others, who pre|&s;ently make &s;uche friuolous &s;cruple, as will not otherwi&s;e be &s;ati&s;fied, then by the reporte of &s;aincte Thomas. I &s;peak not this by the Marchauntes, whom for their freedomes of trade, I would not haue pre&s;&s;ed to any further charge, then this fir&s;t
<PB REF="5">preparacion, but rather by &s;uche as haue great affection, to hazarde the chaungyng of their e&s;tates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Fraunces Drake his pa&s;&s;edge on|ly through the Iles of Molucca, was cau&s;e of a preparation thither of &s;euenteene thou&s;ande poundes, whereof there was not a|boue fiue or &s;ix thou&s;and in Marchaun|dize, the re&s;t in other char|ges of Ship|pyng and ex|pen&s;iue pro|ui&s;ion.</NOTE> and would be well content to goe in the Voyage, if thei might onely bee a&s;&s;ured that there is &s;uche a Countrey, and that their money &s;hould not be wa&s;ted to nothyng in the preparations. The right exa|mination of this poincte, mu&s;t bee the contrary &s;equell of the common Poruerbe, <HI>Nothyng venture, nothyng haue,</HI> &s;o on the other &s;ide by venturyng, many greate good proffites are fou~d out, to the wonderful benefite of the common weale, and to tho&s;e e&s;pecially in priuate, who take on the hazarde of their life and trauaill, or &s;ub&s;tance in the fir&s;t attemptes, and there|fore I would wi&s;he that thei who (God bee thanked) are well able to &s;pare that, whiche is required of eche one towardes the vndertakyng of this aduenture, bee well content and wil|lyng to employe the &s;ame, &s;ince the &s;equell in good and &s;ub|&s;tanciall rea&s;on dooeth promi&s;e, not onely a greate commodi|tie in perticuler to the Marchaunte, who &s;hall here at home exerci&s;e the trade of Marchaundize: But al&s;o to an infinite nomber of other, who pre&s;ently liue in poore e&s;tate, and maie by takyng the opportunitie of this di&s;couerie, alter the &s;ame to a farre better degree. Wherefore to make &s;ome conclu&s;ion vpon this poincte of the Marchauntes mi&s;doubt, who &s;u&s;pec|teth lea&s;t this fir&s;t di&s;burcement, without returne of pre&s;ent gaine, &s;hould not bee all his charge, but that afterwardes he might yet further bee vrged to continue the like againe, as hath happened in the di&s;couerie of the <HI>Mo&s;couian</HI> trade. It maie &s;uffice to con&s;ider, that this is not an action, whiche con|cerneth onely the Marchau~tes perticulerly, but a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> deale more the generall &s;orte of people throughout all Englande: And that when &s;uche relation &s;halbe returned, as that it maie bee founde a matter worthie the folowyng, the whole gene|ralitie will not refu&s;e to contribute towards the furtherance thereof, rather then it &s;hould &s;incke, for wante of any rea&s;ona|ble &s;upplie. But as it is a very little tyme, &s;ince I haue been throughlie re&s;olued, to trie my fortune in the matter, &s;o is it more then tyme, the preparation were in hande already, and
<PB REF="6">therefore no fit tyme now, to make any nomber of ignoraunt men to vnder&s;tande with rea&s;on, the circum&s;tance that belon|geth to a matter of &s;o greate con&s;ideration and importance.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who haue any forwarde myndes in wel doyng, to the generalitie of mankinde, I &s;aie this muche more, that Chri&s;tian charitie doeth as greatly per&s;wade the furtherance of this action, as any other that maie bee laied before vs, in as muche as thereby, wee &s;hall not onely dooe a mo&s;te excellent worke, in re&s;pect of reducyng the &s;auage people, to Chri&s;tia|nitie and ciuilitie, but al&s;o in re&s;pect of our poore &s;orte of peo|ple, whiche are verie many among&s;t vs, liuyng altogether vnprofitable, and often tymes to the great di&s;quiet of the bet|ter &s;orte. For who knoweth not, how by the long peace, hap|pie health, and ble&s;&s;ed plentifulne&s;&s;e, wherewith GOD hath endewed this Realme, that the people is &s;o mightely encrea|&s;ed, as a great nomber beyng brought vp, duryng their youth in their parentes hou&s;es, without any in&s;truction how to gett their liuinges, after their parents decea&s;e, are driuen to &s;ome nece&s;&s;itie, whereby verie often, for want of better education thei fall into &s;ondrie di&s;orders, and &s;o the good &s;orte of people, as I &s;aied before, are by them ordinarily troubled, and them &s;elues ledd on, to one &s;hamefull ende or other, wheras if there might bee founde &s;ome &s;uche kinde of imploymente, as this would bee no doubt but a greater part of them would be with held, fro~ fallyng into &s;uche vile deedes: and in &s;teade thereof, proue greatly &s;eruiceable in tho&s;e affaires, where thei might be &s;o imploied. This I &s;peake of myne owne experience, ha|uyng &s;een diuers come ouer to the warres of the lawe Coun|tries, duryng my r&s;idence in the &s;ame, who here had been ve|rie euill and idle liuers, and by &s;ome little continuance with vs, haue growne to bee verie indu&s;trious in their facultie, whiche I ca~ a&s;&s;ure you, was a more painfull maner of liuing, then in this action is like to fall out, and withall to a purpo&s;e of farre le&s;&s;e valew, in re&s;pect of their perticuler recompe~ce, then with an a&s;&s;ured kinde of good hope is loked for in this.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee in euery poincte, that maie be wi&s;hed for, in
<PB REF="6">a good action and voyage, there is matter and rea&s;on enough to &s;ati&s;fie the well di&s;po&s;ed. But now to growe &s;omwhat ne|rer the quicke, and to &s;howe you &s;ome greater apparaunce, then hath been yet &s;poken of touching the trade whiche is the onely &s;ubiect wherwith I doe meane to entermeddle at this tyme, becau&s;e my addre&s;&s;e hereby is cheifly to me~ of &s;uch like faculty: you may vnder&s;ta~de by that foloweth, the circo~&s;tance of a little di&s;cour&s;e, whiche doeth concerne the&s;e matters ve|ry directly.</P>
<P>In the yere <HI>1534.</HI> Iames Carthier of Deepe, made his fir&s;t di&s;couerie of tho&s;e partes of <HI>America,</HI> whiche lye to the We&s;twardes, and as it were on the back&s;ide of newfounde+land. In whiche voyage his principall intention was to &s;eeke out the pa&s;&s;age, whiche he pre&s;umed might haue been founde out, into the Ea&s;t Indian &s;ea, otherwi&s;e called the pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Cathayo,</HI> but this yere he went no higher, then the I&s;tandes of the a&s;&s;umption in the greate Baie of S. Laureuce, and &s;o returned backe into Fraunce.</P>
<P>The next yere followyng he went with greater proui&s;ion into the grand Bay againe, where he keeping the Northerly &s;hore, ranne vp the greate Riuer that comes doune from <HI>Ca|nada</HI> and other places, vntill at la&s;te with his &s;mall Pinaces, hauyng lefte his greate Shippyng by the waie, he ariued at <HI>Fochelaga</HI> Toune, beeyng fiue hundred leagues within the entrance of the grande Baie. In whiche trauaill he had &s;pent &s;o muche of the yere, that it was now the moneth of October, and therefore thought it co~uenient, for the better enformyng hym&s;elf at large in this di&s;couerie, to Winter it out in tho&s;e partes, which he did at a place called by him&s;elf holy Cro&s;&s;e. This Winter fell out to bee a verie long and hard Winter, as many tymes the like happeneth with vs in the&s;e partes, and the &s;auage people who for the mo&s;te parte, make but a &s;lender kinde of proui&s;ion, euen as it were fro~ hand to mouth fell into &s;ome &s;carcitie of victualles; yet did thei not refu&s;e to &s;erue the Frenchmen, with any thyng thei had all the Win|ter long, albeit at &s;omwhat higher prices towardes the end,
<PB REF="7">when the neede was mo&s;te, as with our &s;elues the like happe|neth at &s;uche tymes. But when the Frenche had had their wantes &s;erued all the yere, and that as yet thei &s;awe not, any apparance of their entended matter, whiche was the di&s;coue|rie of the pa&s;&s;age, and yet imaginyng by the &s;ignes where|with the willyng people, endeuoured to declare their know|ledge in that poinct, that &s;ome good matter might bee had from them, if thei might haue been well vnder&s;toode, they re|&s;olued with them&s;elues, to take &s;ome of the &s;ufficiente&s;t men of that Countrey home into Fraunce, and there to keepe the~ &s;o long, as that hauyng once achieued the Frenche tongue, thei might declare more &s;ub&s;tancially their mynd, and know|ledge in the &s;aied pa&s;&s;age, concludyng this to be the meane of lea&s;t charge, of lea&s;t trauaile, and of lea&s;t hazarde. And when thei came to bethinke them&s;elues, who might bee meete&s;t for it, thei determined to take the King, as the per&s;on who might bee be&s;t enformed of &s;uche partes, as were &s;omewhat remote from his owne Countrey, as al&s;o that for the re&s;pect of hym, the people would be alwaies readie, and content to doe them any further &s;eruice, when it &s;hould happen them to retourne thether againe about the di&s;couerie. Thus the poore Kyng of the Countrey, with two or three others of his chief compa|nions commyng aboard the Frenche Shippes, being requi|red thether to a bancket, was traiterou&s;ly caried awaie into Fraunce, where he liued fower yeares, and then dyed a Chri|&s;tian there, as <HI>Theuet</HI> the Frenche Kynges Co&s;mographer doeth make mention. This outrage and iniurious dealyng, did put the whole countrey people into &s;uche di&s;like with the Frenche, as neuer &s;ince thei would admit any conuer&s;ation, or familiaritie with them, vntill of late yeres, the olde matter beginnyng to growe out of mynd, and beyng the rather dra|wen on by giftes of many triflyng thynges, whiche were of greate value with them, thei are (as I &s;aid) within the&s;e two or three yeares content againe to admitte a traffique,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The yere 1581.</NOTE> whiche two yeares &s;ince, was begonne with a &s;mall Barke of thirtie tunnes, who&s;e retourne was founde &s;o profitable, as the next
<PB REF="7">yere followyng, beyng the la&s;t yeare, by tho&s;e Marchauntes, who meant to haue kept the trade &s;ecrete vnto them&s;elues, from any others of their owne Countrey men, there was hi|red a Shippe of fower &s;core tunnes out of the Ile of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> but not any one Mariner of that place, &s;auyng a Shipboye. This Shippe made her retourne in &s;uche &s;orte, as that this yeare thei haue multiplied three Shippes to bee one of nine &s;core tunnes, an other of an hundred tunnes, and a third of fo|wer &s;core tunnes: whiche reporte is giuen by very &s;ub&s;tanci|all and hone&s;t men of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who &s;awe the &s;aied Shippes in readine&s;&s;e to departe on their Voyage, and were aboarde of &s;ome of them. Here is at this in&s;tant in the towne a man of <HI>Gerne&s;ey, Lewis de &V;icke:</HI> who reporteth to haue credibly heard, that by this la&s;t yeares Voyage the Frenchmen got foreteene or fifteene hundred for euery one hundred. But how &s;oeuer it bee, it carieth good likelihoode of &s;ome notable pro|fite, in a&s;muche as thei doe &s;o greatly, and thus &s;uddenly en|crea&s;e the burthen and number of their Shippes this pre&s;ent yeare. Now, if in &s;o little as two yeares tymes this voyage of the Northerne partes bee growne to &s;uche good pa&s;&s;e as hath been declared vnto you: it is worthe the thinkyng on to con&s;ider what maie bee hoped for, from the Sotherne parte: whiche in all rea&s;on maie promi&s;e a greate deale more. And &s;o as one who was neuer touchd with any indirect meanyng, I pre&s;ume to wi&s;he and per&s;wade you to &s;ome better takyng of this matter to harte, as a thing which I doe verely thinke will turne to your greater and more a&s;&s;ured commoditie, then you receiue by any other Voyage, as yet frequented of &s;o &s;horte and &s;afe a cour&s;e as this hath: dealyng herein no other|wi&s;e with you for your &s;eueral &s;mal &s;ommes, then I doe with my &s;elf, bothe for more of myne owne, then is required of any one of you: be&s;ides the hazard and trauell of my per&s;on, and the total imployment of my poore credite, whiche (I thanke God) hath hetherto pa&s;&s;ed clere and vn&s;potted in mat|ters of greater importaunce and difficultie, then is like to fall out in this betweene you and mee.</P>
