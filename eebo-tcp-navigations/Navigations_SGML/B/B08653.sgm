<HEAD>The CASE of the French Prote|&s;tants Refugees, &s;ettled in and about London, and in the Engli&s;h Plantations in America.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas there is a Clau&s;e in a Bill brought into the Honorable Hou&s;e of Com|mons, Entituled, <HI>An Act for preventing Frauds, and Regulating Abu&s;es in the Plan|tation-Trade;</HI> in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And be it further Enacted, by the Authority afore&s;aid, That no Alien or Foreigner, or any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, other than &s;uch as are Natives of</HI> England <HI>or</HI> Ireland, <HI>or &s;uch Per&s;ons as are born in His Maje&s;ty's Plantations in</HI> A&s;ia, Africa, <HI>or</HI> America, <HI>&s;hall, after the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span"> Day of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Exerci&s;e the Trade or Occupation of a Merchant or Factor, in any of the &s;aid Plan|tations, upon pain of the Forfeiture of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span"> one <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span"> to His Maje&s;ty, one to the Governor of the Plantation, where &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hall &s;o offend, and the other <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span"> to the Per&s;on &s;uing for the &s;ame in any of His Maje&s;ty's Courts in the Plantation where &s;uch Offence &s;hall be committed,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The French Prote&s;tants Refugees in this Kingdom, in behalf of them&s;elves, and of the French Prote&s;tant Refugees &s;ettled in the Engli&s;h Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> do humbly Repre&s;ent, That having been cruelly pro&s;ecuted in their Native Countrey, for the &s;ake of their Religion, they came and &s;heltered them&s;elves in this Kingdom, being invited there-to by the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's <HI>Declaration</HI> of the 28th of <HI>July</HI> 1681: And &s;ince, by another of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, made the 25th of <HI>April</HI> 1689, inviting all French Prote&s;tants hither, and promi&s;ing them their Protection <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That upon this Encouragement they came over in great Numbers, bringing all they could convey away with them, with their Trades, Arts, and Manufactures, and were very kindly received by this Nation, and had that Favour &s;hewn to them, that a great many of them were made Free Deni&s;ons.</P>
<P>That they al&s;o being invited by &s;everal of the Lords Proprietors of the Engli&s;h Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> to go thither and inhabit tho&s;e Countries, many of them tran&s;ported them&s;elves and Families there, with great Hazards, Troubles and Charges.</P>
<P>That &s;ome Hundred Families of them are now &s;ettled there, and have improved in a man|ner tho&s;e Colonies, by making the Ground Arable, and by their Trades, Labours and Indu|&s;try; in&s;omuch, that particularly <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>New York</HI> are, for the mo&s;t, inhabited by them.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid French Prote&s;tants Refugees, &s;ettled here and in tho&s;e Countries, have, on all Occa&s;ions, &s;hewed their Loyalty, Zeal and Affection, to the pre&s;ent Government, by &s;uppor|ting very chearfully the Charges and Taxes of the Land, and wearing Arms for the Defence of it, e&s;pecially in the Attacks of <HI>Quebek, Martinico, Guadalupa, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>St. Domingo,</HI> &s;e|veral having lo&s;t their Lives, and others being wounded, in tho&s;e Occa&s;ions: And many there and here being come to great Lo&s;&s;es, both by the Earthquake at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and by the Enemies Privatiers at Sea.</P>
<P>That if &s;uch a Clau&s;e &s;hould be in&s;erted, all tho&s;e poor People there would be reduced to the greate&s;t Extremities, or forced to return back to <HI>England,</HI> where they mu&s;t &s;tarve, or be maintained by the Publick Charity. Be&s;ides the great Prejudice tho&s;e who are &s;ettled in this Kingdom will unavoidably receive by it, having the mo&s;t part of their &s;mall Stocks imployed in the Plantation Trade, to &s;upport their Brethren there, and procure a &s;mall Livelihood to their Families here.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore they humbly pray this Honorable Hou&s;e to commi&s;erate their Condition, and u&s;e &s;uch Methods for their Relief, as this Honorable Hou&s;e in their Wi&s;dom and Charity &s;hall think fit.</HI></P>
