<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the Seventeen Provinces; And of the Province of <HI>HAYNA&V;LT</HI> in particular, in which is the City of <HI>MONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Seventeen Provinces are, <HI>Brabant, Lembourg, Luxembourg, Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lders,</HI> (which are Dutchies); <HI>Flanders, Artois, Haynault, Hol|land, Zealand, Namur,</HI> and <HI>Zutphen,</HI> (which are Earldoms); the <HI>Marque&s;ate of the Holy Empire, Frie&s;land, Malines, &V;trecht, Overy&s;&s;el,</HI> and <HI>Groningen,</HI> (are Signiories.)</P>
<P>The circuit of the Countrey is about a thou&s;and Engli&s;h Miles, or thirty-four Flemi&s;h Leagues. Tho&s;e that formerly be|longed to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which are now the Seven United Provinces, in the&s;e are contained 208 Walled Towns, 6300 Villages with Pari&s;h-Churches, be&s;ides a great number of other Villages and Hamlets.</P>
<P>The Beeves of <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are very great, and weigh &s;ome of them &s;ix|teen hundred pound weight of that Coun|trey. The Ewes in <HI>Holland, Frie&s;land,</HI> and part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> bring forth three or four Lambs at a time, and the Kine &s;ometimes two Calves. The Countrey brings forth much Mather, wherewith a part of <HI>Europe</HI> is furni&s;hed; Wood, and Hemp and Flax in great abundance.</P>
<P>Five principal Rivers are in the&s;e Coun|treys; the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Scheld,</HI> the <HI>Haa,</HI> the <HI>Eemes.</HI></P>
<P><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>The <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> affords abundance of Sturge|ons, &s;o big, that &s;ome of them weigh 400, and &s;ome 420 pounds weight, and are twelve foot long of <HI>Antwerp</HI> mea&s;ure. It yieldeth al&s;o great &s;tore of Salmons and Salmon-Trouts, Lampreys, Shads, Congers, Mullets, and divers other &s;ort of Fi&s;hes, which coming into fre&s;h Waters, become fat, and excellent good.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scheld</HI> hath divers &s;orts of Fi&s;hes that come out of the Sea; as Sturgeon, Salmon-Trouts, Lampreys, Turbots, Con|gers, Shads, Mullets, Soles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and an infinite number of other Fi&s;h, that multi|tudes of people are relieved therewith.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Rivers, divers Channels are cut out and made Navigable by Man's hand; the principal whereof are at <HI>Bruxells, Ghent, Bruges,</HI> and <HI>Middlebourg.</HI></P>
<P>The Countreys have many Meers, Pools, Lakes, and Mar&s;hes, which fortifie the Countrey, and furni&s;h it with Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Herrings come out of the Northern Seas in incredible multitudes into our Seas in <HI>Augu&s;t, September, October,</HI> until the mid&s;t of <HI>November;</HI> the &s;ooner the cold begins, the &s;ooner they come: They compa&s;s our I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and &s;o pa&s;s into the Nor|thern Ocean.</P>
<P>They have in the&s;e Countreys divers Fore&s;ts and Woods well &s;tored with Red and Fallow-Deer, Goats, Wild Boars, Hares, Coneys, Badgers, Wolves, Foxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which yield good Furs.</P>
<P>The Fowl in this Countrey are, Partridges, Phea&s;ants, Turtle-doves, Quails, Black|birds, and all other &s;orts of Fowl.</P>
<P>The People are Valiant, and very skilful Seamen: they excel in making Woollen|cloth, Tape&s;try, Fu&s;tians, Silks, Velvets.</P>
<P>The Women govern all both within doors and without, and make all bargains; which makes them too imperious and trouble&s;ome. The elde&s;t Daughter is of the greate&s;t Reputation, yet hath no larger Portion than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t. They marry Noble with Ignoble, Young with Old, Ma&s;ter and Servant.</P>
<P>The Air of the&s;e Countreys is &s;omewhat gro&s;s and moi&s;t, yet neverthele&s;s whol&s;ome, and fit for dige&s;tion, and very good for breeding all kind of Cattel. The Summer is fair, plea&s;ant, and delight&s;ome, becau&s;e the Sun is not over hot: the Winter is com|monly long, cold, and &s;harp. The welfare of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> con&s;i&s;ts principally in their Navigation and Fi&s;hery; which, as two inexhau&s;tible Mines, keep and pre&s;erve them in a continual Trading, Riches, and Pro&s;perity; employing 300 fi&s;hing Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, which doth employ near 9000 other Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, and 150000 people, that are employed on Sea and Land in the management of that Trade; and do build yearly 1000 Ships, tho they have not one Timber-&s;tick growing in their own Country.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the Province of <HI>Haynault</HI> in particular; it being the pre|&s;ent Seat of Action, in the Inve&s;ting of <HI>Mons</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> King's Forces in the year <HI>1691.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HAYNA&V;LT</HI> is &s;o named of the River <HI>Hayne,</HI> which runs through it. It is bor|dered on the North with <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> on the South with <HI>Champaign</HI> and <HI>Piccardy,</HI> on the Ea&s;t with the County of <HI>Namur,</HI> and on the We&s;t with the <HI>Scheld,</HI> and part of <HI>Flanders Gallican.</HI> It is 20 Leagues long, and 16 broad; The Air is whol|&s;ome and the Soil good, by rea&s;on that the Countrey is watered with many Rivers, as the <HI>Scheld,</HI> the <HI>Sambre,</HI> the <HI>Tender,</HI> and many other &s;mall Rivulets; there are al&s;o in it many Lakes, Mar&s;hes, Ponds, Pools, Fountains, goodly Woods, and plea&s;ant Fore&s;ts.

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the City of <HI>MONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE City of <HI>MONS,</HI> or <HI>Berghen,</HI> receives its Name from its &s;cituation, which latter in their Language &s;ignifies a Mountain or Hill: but the ri&s;e of the Earth is &s;o gentle, as it cannot be &s;aid to be Mountainous. It is a Noble City for Scituation, Inhabitants and Buildings: It is a very &s;trong place by Nature and Art, and may be environed with Water at plea&s;ure. The City-wall is very &s;trong, and is fortified with three large and deep Ditches, and with an ancient Ca&s;tle. The place is great and fair, and beautified with &s;umptuous Buildings, both publick and private, with rich Fountains, and with rich Citizens and Arti&s;ts. Here is great concour&s;e of People for Commerce. The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Councel u&s;ed to &s;it here, which admini&s;trated Ju&s;tice to all the Countrey: All which Prerogatives gave it the Precedency over all other Cities in the Province of <HI>Haynault.</HI> It commands large and &s;pacious Fields round about it.</P>
<P>This City is &s;tronger by its Natural Scituation, than by Manual Indu&s;try: It is cut through on the lower-&s;ide with a little Rivulet called <HI>Truita;</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oon as it goes out of it, falls into another &s;omewhat bigger than <HI>Haen.</HI></P>
<P>To this City the French Forces being ha&s;tned from their Quarters, upon notice of the ROYAL CONGRESS at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the Powerful Army agreed on among&s;t the Confederate Princes, in conjunction with His mo&s;t Se|rene Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who are jointly agreed to pull down the a&s;piring Pride of <HI>France;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King re&s;olved to attempt &s;omething early, that he might look big with Pride once more before his fall: And on the fifteenth of <HI>March,</HI> 1690/1. New Stile, their Cavalry began to inve&s;t it in a formal manner, u&s;ing all diligence to &s;treighten the pa&s;&s;ages; and &s;oon after the arrival of the In|fantry, the Enemy formed the Siege with a con&s;iderable Body of Men, and pro|ceeded ha&s;tily to break ground, and work on their Lines of Circumvallation and Contravallation, to pu&s;h on the Siege before the Confederate Armies can be embodied. But it is well hoped, that by rea&s;on of the City's being &s;ufficient|ly Gari&s;oned with Old Soldiers, amounting to Six Thou&s;and Foot and Seven Hundred Hor&s;e, well di&s;ciplin'd, under experienced Commanders; of which there are &s;ix <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiments, and two of <HI>Brandenburgers;</HI> the re&s;t being <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Walloons,</HI> Commanded by the Valiant Prince of <HI>Burgue,</HI> an experi|enced Soldier; the City being plentifully furni&s;hed with all manner of Stores, Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, the French King may lo&s;e his aim, in endeavouring by this ha&s;ty attempt to undermine all the Councels of the Congre&s;s at the <HI>Hague.</HI> But let him call to mind, and look back to the year 1678. where our pre&s;ent KING (then Prince of <HI>Aurange</HI>) with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and other Noble Heroes of the Engli&s;h Nation, rai&s;ed the Siege of <HI>Mons,</HI> again&s;t all the Power of the French King in that year, and relieved the City. And who knows but God by his good Providence may do the &s;ame again, by the Pru|dent Conduct of our Au&s;picious King <HI>WILLIAM?</HI> whom God long pre&s;erve; and let all the good People of <HI>England</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
