<HEAD>BY The <HI>GOVERNOUR &amp;</HI> General COURT <HI>Of the COLONY of the</HI> Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, <HI>In New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>IT having been a thing too Sen&s;ible and Obvious to e&s;cape the Ob&s;ervation of all who are not wholly Strangers in our</HI> I&s;rael; <HI>that this poor Land has laboured under a long</HI> Series <HI>of Afflicti|ons and Calamities, whereby we have &s;uffered &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in our precious and plea&s;ant Things, and have &s;een the Anger of the righteous God against us, expre&s;&s;ed in Characters, which ought to be as</HI> Terrible <HI>as they mu&s;t needs be vi&s;ible unto us; it having al&s;o, both by the</HI> Te&s;timonies <HI>of tho&s;e, that after the mo&s;t humble and exact Enquiries into the Mind of God, have di&s;covered the &s;ame unto us, and by their own General and Repeated Confe&s;&s;ions, become undeniable; That a</HI> Cor|ruption <HI>of Manners attended with Inexcu&s;able</HI> Degeneracies <HI>and</HI> Apo&s;ta&s;ies, <HI>found in too many of this People, is the cau&s;e of that Controver&s;ie, which the God of our Fathers has, for many years been maintaining with us: It being likewi&s;e at this day, &s;uch a</HI> Probation-time <HI>with all</HI> New-England <HI>as this Countrey has never before &s;een from the fir&s;t Foundation of it, and the Judgments of that Holy God, who hath beheld how incorrigible we have hitherto been under all His Di&s;pen&s;ations, now arriving to &s;uch an Extremity, That</HI> the Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees, <HI>and we are in imminent danger of peri&s;hing, if a &s;peedy REFORMATION of our</HI> Provoking Evils <HI>prevent it not</HI> <GAP DESC="blank"> THIS COURT have therefore thought it needful to praeface their other Endea|vours for the Publick Welfare, with a very &s;olemn Admonition unto this whole People, that they every where give Demon&s;trations of a thorough <HI>Repentance,</HI> without which we have little rea&s;on to hope for any good &s;ucce&s;s in our Affairs.</P>
<P>Wherefore it is Ordered, that the <HI>Laws</HI> of this Colony again&s;t <HI>Vice,</HI> and all &s;orts of <HI>Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Prophane&s;s</HI> (which <HI>Laws</HI> have too much lo&s;t their edg by the late Inter|ruption of the Government) be now faithfully and Vigorou&s;ly put in Execution; Parti|cularly the <HI>Laws</HI> again&s;t <HI>Bla&s;phemy, Cur&s;ing, Prophane Swearing, Lying, Unlawful Gaming, Sabbath breaking, Idlene&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, &V;ncleanne&s;s, and all the Enticements, and Nur&s;eries of &s;uch Impieties.</HI> Together with all other the whol&s;ome <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> agreeable to the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Countrey; by the Execution whereof, we may approve our &s;elves <HI>a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI></P>
<PB REF="1" MS="y">
<P>And as all Per&s;ons are hereby warned to avoid tho&s;e <HI>Vices</HI> which the&s;e <HI>Laws</HI> are de&s;igned for the Prevention and Cha&s;ti&s;ement of (the <HI>Lovers</HI> of, and <HI>Pleaders</HI> for, &s;uch Iniquities, being among the principal <HI>Troublers</HI> of their Countrey) So all inferiour <HI>Officers</HI> are enjoyn'd to perform their Duty in finding and bringing out Offenders again&s;t the afore&s;aid <HI>Laws,</HI> and withal to give notice to &s;uch Offenders that they mu&s;t expect the Ju&s;tice of an <HI>Exemplary Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>And that no attempt towards <HI>Reformation,</HI> may want that A&s;&s;i&s;tance which all good men will be willing to give thereunto, 'tis hoped that the Mini&s;ters of God will to the publick Reading of this <HI>Proclamation,</HI> adjoyn their own fervent La|bours, not only for the Rebukeing and Suppre&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e <HI>Provoking Evils,</HI> which are marked for common Hatred: but al&s;o to witne&s;s again&s;t the more <HI>Spi|ritual Sins,</HI> which fall not &s;o much under the cognizance of Humane <HI>Laws,</HI> namely, &s;uch as <HI>&V;nbelief, Worldline&s;s, Here&s;y, Pride, Wrath, Strife, Envy,</HI> and the <HI>Neglect</HI> of communion with God, in both Natural and In&s;tituted <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> and the <HI>Contempt</HI> of the <HI>everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> with a &s;hameful want of due <HI>Family-In&s;truction,</HI> which are the <HI>Roots of Bitterne&s;s</HI> in the mid&s;t of us.</P>
<P>Moreover, after the Example of <HI>Pious Rulers</HI> commended in Sacred Writ; the <HI>Churches</HI> every where are hereby advi&s;ed to give utmo&s;t Encouragement unto the Faithful and Watchful <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of their Souls; to &s;eek (where they <HI>lack</HI>) a full Set|tlement and Enjoyment of &s;uch <HI>Officers,</HI> as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has appointed for their Edification; to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly and frequently on their <HI>Covenants,</HI> to &s;harpen their <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e that <HI>walk di&s;orderly;</HI> and immediately to compo&s;e their <HI>Differences</HI> and <HI>Contentions</HI> (if <HI>&s;uch</HI> there be) whereby any of them may be di&s;tempered and enfeebled, that &s;o they may become <HI>Terrible as an Army with Banners.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore it is Expected that the &s;everal <HI>Towns</HI> within this Juri&s;diction do &s;peedily furni&s;h them&s;elves with all fit means for the good <HI>Education of Youth,</HI> and take &s;pecial care to avoid <HI>Factions</HI> and <HI>Quarrels</HI> in their other <HI>Town Affairs;</HI> and all Plantations are &s;trictly forbidden to continue without the Advantages of having the <HI>Word</HI> of God con&s;tantly preacht unto them, or without a Sincere and Active Indu&s;try, to obtain the Pre&s;ence of the Lord Chri&s;t in all His ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P>And Finally, this whole People are hereby adverti&s;ed, that if the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ayes</HI> for an univer&s;al Reformation, &s;hall be ob&s;tructed (as tho&s;e in the dayes of the Reform|ing <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> were) by Mens being <HI>&s;ettled on their Lees,</HI> and <HI>hating to be Reformed,</HI> they can rea&s;onably look for no other i&s;&s;ue than this, that the jealous God <HI>will pu|ni&s;h them yet &s;even times more for their iniquities:</HI> But, that if the God of Heaven &s;hall grant unto them the Grace to <HI>Remember whence they are fallen, and Repent and do the fir&s;t Works,</HI> it will give a greater Pro&s;pect of <HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> than can ari&s;e from the be&s;t <HI>Coun&s;els,</HI> and bigge&s;t <HI>Armies.</HI></P>
<P>The Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> thus <HI>endeavoured,</HI> is now <HI>recommended</HI> unto the ble&s;|&s;ing of the Almighty, with whom alone it is, to Recover a Back&s;liding people; per&s;wading our &s;elves, that the Event thereof would be <HI>Salvation nigh unto us, and Glory dwelling in our Land.</HI></P>
