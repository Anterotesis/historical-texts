<P>Wee had thought to have given over printing our Forraigne avi&s;oes, for that the Licencer (out of a partiall affec|tion) would not oftentimes let pa&s;&s;e apparant truth, and in other things (oftentimes) &s;o cro&s;&s;e and alter which made vs almo&s;t weary of Printing, but he being vani&s;hed (and that Office fallen vpon another, more vnder&s;tanding in the&s;e Forraine affaires, and as you will finde more candid.) We are againe (by the favour of his Maje&s;tie and the State) re&s;olved to goe on in Printing if we &s;hall finde the World to give a better acceptation of them, (then of late) by their Weekly buying them. It is well knowne the&s;e Novels are well e&s;teemed in all parts of the World (but heere) by the more Iudicious, which wee can impute to no other but the di&s;continuance of them, and the vncertaine dayes of publi&s;hing them, which if the Po&s;t faile vs not wee &s;hall keepe a con&s;tant Day every weeke therein, whereby every man may certainly expect them, and &s;o wee take leave,</P>

<P>SIR, I cannot let pa&s;&s;e, to give you a briefe rehear&s; ll of the &s;udden alteration here, viz. Vpon Saturday la&s;t the pro cur|rant the Secretary <HI>Migel de Vas Gon&s;aluez</HI> was &s;laine in his quar|ter in the Palace by the Nobility, and throwne out at the win|dow in the <HI>Terrara de pa&s;&s;a,</HI> where his corps did remaine all that day and night following, being footed and &s;tript by the peo|ple, his beard, eares, and &s;ome of his members cut off: and next morning it was conveyed in mo&s;t abject manner to the <HI>Mi&s;eri|cordia.</HI> Pre&s;ently when the Secretary was &s;laine, the Gentry
<PB N="464" REF="27">rode through mo&s;t &s;treets of the citie, well accompanied and armed, crying, <HI>Viva Don Guan quarto,</HI> which was &s;o generally received by the people, that there appeared not the lea&s;t oppo|po&s;ition, all taking armes in the cau&s;e, appearing under their co|lours in the <HI>Terra de pa&s;&s;a,</HI> to wait the command of the Nobili|ty, now Governours. The day was &s;olemnized with joy, by ringing of bells, and di&s;charging the great ordnance of &s;hips in the river, which for the mo&s;t part were Engli&s;h. Sunday the &s;econd of December, the ca&s;tle of Lisbone rendred to the Nobility, and two dayes after the ca&s;tle of Bellyne, for want of victuals, and now they are upon S. <HI>Guans,</HI> that doth yet hold out, but within few dayes will be forced al&s;o to render.</P>
<P>The King came to the citie two dayes &s;ince, and now is a &s;tage building upon <HI>Terra de pa&s;&s;a,</HI> for him to bee &s;worne and crowned, which the King doth de&s;ire to doe in the view of the world, to &s;hew, as he &s;aith, that hee comes to enjoy his right, which hath been &s;o long detained from him.</P>
<P>The Portuguezes have &s;howne &s;uch celerity as is to bee ad+mited, there having not been in this accord, pa&s;&s;ing three or foure &s;laine, which made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance upon the comming of the Nobility to the Secretary.</P>
<P>The po&s;t from Spaine, Madrid, and Sivell, do not now goe, which will breed much alteration in trade, e&s;pecially with &s;uch as are <HI>Cambia-dores:</HI> and likewi&s;e I doubt we &s;hall find<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> much alteration for our Engli&s;h commodities, all now changing the fa&s;hions of apparrell, leaving their owne, and imitate the Eng|li&s;h and French fa&s;hions what po&s;&s;ibly they can. Thus be&s;ee|ching God that all may be for the be&s;t, to who&s;e mo&s;t holy protection I commit you, and re&s;t yours to command:</P>
