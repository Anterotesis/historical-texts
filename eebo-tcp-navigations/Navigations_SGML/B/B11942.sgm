<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe Diuine Power that in&s;pired the breath of life into man, infu&s;ed the life of Authoritie in|to the King. This in&s;piration maketh man the image of God; that other maketh the King in particular the Lieutenant of God. And there|fore humane right no &s;ooner &s;tileth one with the name of a King, but diuine Heraldrie graceth him with the title of a mortall God, thereby intimating that it is his chiefe&s;t glory, within the &s;phaere of his Royaltie to imitate the &s;ingular gouernment of that power, who&s;e Sub&s;titute he is, and with who&s;e name he is honoured. Now the vnparalleled excellencie of diuine gouernment ouer the world is grounded vpon that di&s;tinct knowledge which the Creator hath of the nature, con|dition,
<PB REF="4"> and v&s;e of all creatures &s;ubiect to his gouernment. And &s;urely the readie&s;t way for an earthly Potentate to make his go|uernment exactly analogicall to that <HI>Jdea,</HI> will be by getting an accurate knowledge of the nature and qualitie of the Land and People ouer which God hath made him his Lieutenant gene|rall. But the <HI>Metropolis</HI> and the <HI>Royall Throne</HI> require &s;uch fre|quencie of the Soueraignes pre&s;ence, that &s;uch knowledge can|not be gotten by his owne ob&s;eruations. Our Maps therefore (e&s;pecially being ioyned with di&s;creet ob&s;eruations) as they are delightfull unto all, are e&s;pecially v&s;efull vnto the King: for by this meanes, though re&s;iding in his Princely Seat, he may as the eye from the head, contemplate with much delight and pro|fit the remote&s;t Territories of his Kingdomes. And becau&s;e af|faires of a higher nature take vp the principal of his time, longer De&s;criptions are not for the purpo&s;e; the more compendious, &s;o as accurate, are mo&s;t &s;utable to the calling of a King.</P>

<P>_OF all morall knowledge, the knowing of our &s;elues; of all Ma|thematicall, the knowledge of our owne Countrey is the mo&s;t v&s;efull and profitable. Yet had mo&s;t men rather &s;pend them|&s;elues and their precious houres in the mo&s;t difficult trifles in the world, than once to enter into them&s;elues. And mo&s;t Stu|dents in Geographie take more delight to contemplate the remo|te&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous Countries of the earth, than lightly to examine the De&s;criptions of their owne. So that (as if like tho&s;e <HI>Lamij</HI> in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> they had eyes abroad, and inclo&s;ed them in boxes in their owne homes) they are accurate in the De&s;criptions of the &s;malle&s;t village in a forraine King|dome,
<PB REF="6"> when they &s;carce know how the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e Country is &s;ituated. The excu&s;es that are ordinary for this common neglect, are, either that accurate De&s;criptions are wanting, or that they are &s;o voluminous, that they are preiudiciall both to time and pur&s;e. But behold (courteous Reader) thou ha&s;t here exhibited vnto thee &s;uch exqui|&s;ite compendious Surueyes of thine owne natiue Countrey, as will at once take away the&s;e excu&s;es, and ea&s;e thee of this double grieuance. The Country de&s;cribed, both in regard of Commodities wherewith it is fraught, and places of note wherewith it is graced, is a perfect epitome of the World; the&s;e Maps and De&s;criptions are a compleat epitome of it, and therefore in a double regard worthy thy peru&s;all. And becau&s;e no Maps can be rightly vnder&s;tood without &s;ome in&s;ight in the generall termes or notions of Geographie, I haue prefixed a compendious Delineation of the &s;ame. If thou reade&s;t them, and pro|fite&s;t by them, I haue the principall of my de&s;ire; If thou doe&s;t both, with a candid ap|probation of the Labour, I haue it with Intere&s;t.</P>

<PB REF="7">
<P>The <HI>Meridian</HI> is a <HI>Circle</HI> drawne by the <HI>Poles</HI> of the world, and the verticall point of the place. Of the&s;e (though the number &s;et downe in the <HI>Artificiall Globe</HI> at the mo&s;t be but 180) are there to be &s;uppo&s;ed in the <HI>Reall Globe</HI> as many as there are <HI>Zeniths</HI> or verticall points from Ea&s;t to We&s;t.

<P>Among the&s;e one is of &s;peciall note and u&s;e, which <HI>Geographers</HI> commonly call the fir&s;t and chiefe <HI>Meridian.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Meridian</HI> is that from which the longitude of places from We&s;t to Ea&s;t is reckoned.

<P>The <HI>Rationall Horizon</HI> is a Circle pa&s;&s;ing by the Center of the Earth, who&s;e two Poles are the point directly ouer a mans head, which is called the <HI>Zenith,</HI> and the point directly vnder his feet, called the <HI>Nadyr.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rationall Horizon</HI> is that which Geographers reckon among the greater Circles, and not the <HI>Sen&s;ible;</HI> but both change according to the change of the place which way &s;oeuer it is.</P>
<P>The v&s;e of this is to di&s;cerne the diuers ri&s;ings and &s;ettings of the Starres.</P>
<PB REF="8">
<P>The <HI>Aequator</HI> is a great Circle pa&s;&s;ing thorow the mid&s;t of the Earth, and diuiding it exactly into two equall parts or <HI>Haemi&s;pheres,</HI> North and South. The v&s;e of it is to &s;hew the latitude of any place; for from it both the Southerne latitude betwixt it and the South Pole, and the Nor|therne latitude betwixt it and the North Pole is to be reckoned.</P>

<P>Both of the&s;e are 23 degrees di&s;tant from the <HI>Aequinoctiall,</HI> the one Southward, and the other Northward.</P>

<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a &s;pace of earth contained betwixt two le&s;&s;er Circles: the number of them is fiue, whereof two are ouer-cold, one ouer-hot, and two temperate.</P>
<P>The two ouer-cold <HI>Zones</HI> are tho&s;e parts of the Earth which lie betwixt the two Polar Cir|cles and the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<PB REF="8">
<P>The two temperate <HI>Zones</HI> are betwixt the <HI>Tropicks</HI> of <HI>Cancer</HI> and the <HI>Articke,</HI> and betwixt the <HI>Tropicke</HI> of <HI>Capricorne</HI> and the <HI>Antarticke</HI> Circles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Torrid</HI> or ouer-hot <HI>Zone</HI> is that which lieth betwixt both the <HI>Tropicks.</HI></P>
<P>Both the <HI>Torrid</HI> and <HI>Frigid Zones</HI> (though the Ancients thought them to be altogether vn|habitable) are in many parts at this day well inhabited.</P>
<P>Againe, the Inhabitants in the burnt <HI>Zones</HI> are called <HI>Amphi&s;cians,</HI> for that they haue the meridian &s;hadow on both &s;ides of them, &s;ome part of the yeere Northwards, and &s;ometimes Southwards. In the temperate <HI>Zones, Hetoro&s;cians,</HI> hauing the &s;hadow but on one &s;ide; and the frigid <HI>Peri&s;cians</HI> hauing their &s;hadowes runne round about.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Inhabitants in the &s;ame parallel and oppo&s;ite part of the Meridian are called <HI>Periaecians.</HI></P>
<P>In the like parrallel on the other &s;ide of the line and &s;ame meridian <HI>Antiaecians.</HI> In the like pa|rallel on the other &s;ide of the line and oppo&s;ite part of the meridian, <HI>Antipodes.</HI></P>
<P>A climate is a &s;pace of earth contained betwixt two parallels, di&s;tant from the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> towards the North or South Pole: the v&s;e of climats is to di&s;tingui&s;h the length and &s;hort|ne&s;&s;e of the daies in all places, for places as they differ North and South, &s;o haue they vnequall daies and nights; the more Northerly climats and places hauing longer daies in the Summer, and longer nights in the Winter than the more Southerly doe enioy.</P>
<P>Thus much of the generall or &s;phericall part of <HI>Geography.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;peciall or Topographicall part hereof is that which &s;etteth forth the de&s;cription of the <HI>Terre&s;triall Globe</HI> &s;o farre forth as it is diuided into di&s;tinct parts or places, and is either

It is but a &s;mall Shire, and yet is diuided into 17 Hundreds, which haue in them 165 Pari&s;h-Churches, and eight Market Townes, whereof the mo&s;t famous and euer flouri&s;hing Vniuer&s;itie of <HI>Cambridge</HI> is the principall, which is &s;ituate on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Riuer <HI>Caine,</HI> from whence (as &s;ome hold) &s;he hath her name; although other Hi&s;tories of antiquitie deriue it from <HI>Cantaber,</HI> who 375 yeeres before the Incarnation had there &s;etled the Mu&s;es &s;eat. And albeit in many Ages this Citie (like many others) hath ta&s;ted many wofull fortunes, yet now is it beautified and fairely adorned with &s;ixteene mo&s;t magnificent Colleges and Halls, full &s;tored with painfull Students, and as euer it hath, &s;o &s;till it doth with abundant increa&s;e of mo&s;t learned and famous Do|cto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Teachers, and Profe&s;&s;ors of all Arts and Sciences, enrich not only this our Land, but all others whereto they are di&s;per&s;ed.

Another Citie in this Shire was &s;ometime al&s;o of great note, called by the <HI>Saxons Elg,</HI> but now by vs <HI>Ely,</HI> which grew fir&s;t famous for one <HI>Audrey</HI> a Prince&s;&s;e, and wife to <HI>Egbert</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who there built a Nunnery, and leauing her husband, was the fir&s;t Abbe&s;&s;e of it her &s;elfe.

And though (as other Shires bordering on <HI>Scotland</HI> are) it is exempted from Sub&s;idie, and therefore wants the diui&s;ion of Hundreds, yet are there (be&s;ides Chapels of ea&s;e) 58 Pari&s;h-Churches contained in it: and al&s;o there are 20 Riuers in it, hauing 33 Bridges. There is one Citie, one Bi&s;hop|ricke, three Fore&s;ts, and eight Parkes.

The ancient Inhabitants of this County were the <HI>Silures,</HI> a fierce, hardy, and valiant people, as appeares by their nine yeeres oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Romans.</HI> And afterwards the <HI>Saxons</HI> made this County a part of their <HI>Mercian</HI> Kingdome: and <HI>Sutton</HI> was their Royall Court kept of their great King <HI>Offa.</HI> Before the Conque&s;t this County was accounted vvith tho&s;e of <HI>Wales</HI> again&s;t <HI>England;</HI> but when it was ioyned to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with diuers Ca&s;tles was it fortified again&s;t the <HI>Welch:</HI> for wee reade that in times pa&s;t it hath beene &s;trengthned with 28 &s;trong and faire Ca&s;tles, mo&s;t of which are now low buried in the heapes of their owne ruines. Of remarkable things in this Shire, the Spring called <HI>Bone Well,</HI> neere <HI>Ri|chards Ca&s;tle,</HI> is famous for Fi&s;h-bones and no Fi&s;h, which though it be cleerely clean&s;ed thereof, will &s;hortly after be furni&s;hed afre&s;h with the like. But the great wonder was the admirable motion of <HI>Marcley Hill,</HI> containing about 26 acres, within our owne memorie, <HI>Anno</HI> 1571, which with a great noi&s;e remoued it &s;elfe from its owne place, and went continually for three dayes together, carrying with it &s;heepe in their coats, hedge-rowes and trees, and ouerthrowing <HI>Kinna&s;ton</HI> Chapell, and diuers trees, turning two high waies neere 100 yards from their v&s;uall Road, and bearing the earth before it the &s;pace of 400 yards. With very many Religious Hou&s;es hath this Shire beene adorned; but in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth were vtterly ruinated, as many others in all other Counties. The Aire is here plea&s;ent, healthfull, and temperate; and the Soile as fertile and fruitfull as any other in <HI>England,</HI> yeelding Corne, Cattell, Wooll, Wheat, and almo&s;t all other nece&s;&s;ary commodities, for the v&s;e of the Inhabitants.</P>

It is diuided into fiue Hundreds, which are &s;ubdiuided into 64. Pari&s;hes: 26. Riuers and Riuerets, with nine Bridges, are plea&s;antly inter&s;per&s;ed in it. And for negotiating of bu&s;ine&s;&s;e for the Inhabitants, foure Market Townes, whereof <HI>Cardigan</HI> the Shire Towne is the principall, which on the North &s;ide of the Riuer <HI>Tyuy,</HI> on a high banke is plea&s;antly &s;eated, which <HI>Gilbert de Clare,</HI> to whom King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t gaue this County, encompa&s;&s;ed with a wall that hath three waies for pa&s;&s;age into the Towne; and built there al&s;o vpon a Rocke, a faire large and &s;trong Ca&s;tle, which the bitter &s;tormes of time haue now transformed into a monument of ruines: vnder which Ca&s;tle is the Bridge, which is the onely pa&s;&s;able way ouer the Riuer <HI>Ty|uy.</HI> The eleuation of the Pole is here 52. 16. and the Longitude 19. 55. The ancient Inhabitants of this Countie, that <HI>Ptolemie</HI> makes mention of, were the <HI>Dimetiae,</HI> who vnder the conduct of their King <HI>Ca|ractacus,</HI> were mo&s;t valiant oppo&s;ers of the <HI>Romans,</HI> till <HI>Iulius Frontinus</HI> ouercame and &s;ubdued them. This &s;mall Shire, I finde was furni&s;hed with few Religious Hou&s;es, namely at <HI>Cardigan I&s;tradfleet, Llan-Badern-Vaur,</HI> which &s;ometime was a Bi&s;hops Sea, and yet the&s;e few could not e&s;cape the force of Fortune, and Time the deuourer of all things. The Aire is here open, &s;harp, and piercing, and yet withall whole&s;ome. The Soile hilly and vneuen, except towards the Sea-&s;ide, where it is more plaine, hauing plea&s;ant valleyes and rich pa&s;tures. And the chiefe&s;t Commodities of this Countie are Corne, Cattell, Fowle and Fi&s;h; and in &s;ome places are Mines of Lead.</P>

And for Commerce and Traf|fique in this Countie, are but three Market Townes, <HI>viz. Bala, Dolgelhe</HI> and <HI>Harlech,</HI> which is accounted the principall, though it be much defectiue both of building or any other ornaments befitting a Shire Towne, for in a barren place it &s;tands, but bleake and cold, where there is little plentie of any thing but of Fowle and Fi&s;h. Yet is there a &s;trong and faire Ca&s;tle, &s;ituate vpon a Mount encircled with a double Bulwarke, which is a &s;ure defence again&s;t the entrance there of any forren inuaders. And though the Con&s;table of this Ca&s;tle by Patent is al&s;o Maior of the Towne, yet doth the want of repaire thereof threaten a &s;udden decay.
