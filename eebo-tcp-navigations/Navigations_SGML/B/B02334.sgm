<HEAD>POEM ON HIS <HI>Royal Highne&s;&s;es Re&s;tauration</HI> to the Dignity of Lord High Admiral of England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THe Royal Name of <HI>YORK</HI> has too much worth,</L>
<L>For any Common Mouth to Trumpet forth,</L>
<L>His Prai&s;e; for who dares venture to relate</L>
<L>The glorious progre&s;s of his Royal Fate,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t be acquainted fir&s;t that's Royal Sire</L>
<L>Highly e&s;teem'd him, (whom all ought t'admire)</L>
<L>In&s;tructed him in all Obedience,</L>
<L>When he &s;hou'd die unto his Son the Prince;</L>
<L>Which took &s;uch la&s;ting root in <HI>YORKS</HI> great heart,</L>
<L>That he ne'r from that Royal Law did &s;tart.</L>
<L>His Youth was &s;ea&s;on'd with the generous Rules,</L>
<L>The Grave&s;t and mo&s;t Learned in the Schools</L>
<L>Cou'd teach him, and when that his Age began</L>
<L>To &s;pur him forwards to become a man,</L>
<L>He as impatient of the ling ring time,</L>
<L>Did force his Youth Honors high mount to climbe;</L>
<L>Early he thru&s;t his budding Glories out</L>
<L>In foreign Courts; mo&s;t Princes round about,</L>
<L>Hearing our Hero's Gallantris, Proclaim</L>
<L>The thriving Glorys of his infant Fame:</L>
<L>The French and Spani&s;h King who Grac'd his hands</L>
<L>With th' highe&s;t Dignities of their Commands;</L>
<L>By Experience found his Valour &s;uch a Prize,</L>
<L>That none excell'd, and few cou'd Equalize;</L>
<L>Therefore my Mu&s;e with empty Graces Sings</L>
<L>His Fame, which has been better &s;ung by Kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us with thankful Reverence,</L>
<L>On bended Knees for his great Providence,</L>
<L>Wor&s;hip the Rider on the Heav'nly Throne,</L>
<L>Who for him &s;how'd his great Salvation,</L>
<L>Who &s;av'd him from the raging Lyon-Dutch,</L>
<L>Nor &s;uffer'd one of his curs'd Paws to touch</L>
<L>His Royal head, next that the bay&s;trous Seas,</L>
<L>Which hundreds then devour'd, dur&s;t not to &s;eize</L>
<L>His Life pre&s;erving it for higher things,</L>
<L>To &s;ubject <HI>Scotland</HI> to the be&s;t of Kings,</L>
<L>And tho' the heaven permitted &s;wearing <HI>Otes,</HI></L>
<L>To be the Bell-Weather to lead the Votes,</L>
<L>Of a ra&s;h Parliament to Vote him down,</L>
<L>And Bar him from his ju&s;t Succe&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Yet &s;till pre&s;erves his Title to the Crown.</L>
<L>Which &s;av'd him al&s;o from the powers of Hell,</L>
<L>(The place appointed for all that rebell,)</L>
<L>The Authors of that dire Con&s;piracy,</L>
<L>Again&s;t his Life and's Sacred Maje&s;ty;</L>
<L>That be might rai&s;e him up again above,</L>
<L>All Malice to his Sacred Brothers Love:</L>
<L>Who hath re&s;tored him both by Sea and Land,</L>
<L>To the high Tru&s;t of which he had Command.</L>
<L>Thus Arm'd by his Brothers power, &s;enc'd with the Prayr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>
<L>Of Loyal hearts th' Illu&s;trious <HI>Hero</HI> dares,</L>
<L>Do any thing that can be underr&s;tood,</L>
<L>To tend unto his Soveraigns honor and the good.</L>
<L>Of all the Subjects of this happy <HI>I&s;le,</HI></L>
<L>Which has &s;o long been graced with the &s;mile</L>
<L>Of Hea ven, whil&s;t all our Neighbring Countrys are,</L>
<L>Shook by the con&s;tant Earthquakes of a War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Therefore in vain &s;hall earth and hell combine,</L>
<L>To part his Tittle from the Royal Line,</L>
<L>And with Religious mask their Plots conceal,</L>
<L>Sinceth Authors and the crimes Heaven did reveal,</L>
<L>And Earth Revenge, and may all Plotters be,</L>
<L>Still Branded with Eternal In&s;amy,</L>
<L>Who &s;hall Con&s;pire again&s;t great <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>Thee.</HI></L>
