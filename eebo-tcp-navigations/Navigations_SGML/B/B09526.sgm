<P>THere is nothing of greater advantage to a Land, than the opening of Rivers, that by the Com|munication of them, the more <HI>Inland</HI> Countries may not only abound with all the varieties in which they exceed, but that all other manner of Goods, (though never of &s;o great burthen) may be daily imported or exported to the incredible ca&s;e and benefit of the Sub|ject.</P>

<PB REF="5"> of good Arti&s;ts, could not accompli&s;h (though attempted) with &s;o much honour and advantage.</P>
<P>It having plea&s;ed Almighty God, to re&s;tore Your Maje|&s;ty to the Government of this Nation, and Your Maje&s;ty having of your &s;elf a delight in the water, I have pre&s;umed to make this addre&s;s unto Your Maje&s;ty, concerning a Na|vigable pa&s;&s;age upon the two famous Rivers of <HI>Avon</HI> and <HI>Thames,</HI> to the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and &s;o to the Sea, which will be a work of great advantage, were your Maje&s;ty &s;o gratiou&s;ly plea&s;ed, that it might be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Act of <HI>Parliament</HI> (as was that noble pa&s;&s;age by water from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford</HI>) &amp; no le&s;s encouragement would it be to the undertakers, who then would undergo &s;o famous a work even at their own charge, and through all ages would crown your Maje&s;ties prai&s;es, &amp; love to the publick; for Rivers will remain when Cities and Towns do fall, and it will be no little honour unto me, that in &s;o great a work your Maje&s;ty will de&s;cend from the height of your own judgment, to reflect on the endeavours and the experience of him, who is,</P>

<HEAD>Of the Opening of Rivers for Na|vigation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN the&s;e <HI>Papers</HI> we are not to re|flect upon this I&s;land, as capable of &s;uch Waterings as the flat Netherlands, who&s;e Benefits may &s;eem to allure us to the like Indu&s;try; Ne|verthele&s;s <HI>Englands</HI> fair Val|leys, and rich In-lets, through which many noble Rivers in&s;inuate them&s;elves, might, with the imita|tion of the indu&s;trious Netherlander, be made in many places docible of Navigation, to the ine&s;ti|mable comfort, &s;atisfaction, ea&s;e, and profit of the publick, e&s;pecially during the &s;even (which we call) Winter-months, when Waters abound in our Ri|vers, and the Sea-coa&s;ts &s;o dangerous for Naviga|tion: but with more charge Navigation may be maintained all the whole year, upon many of our Rivers.</P>
<P>The Objections of the differences of the Soyl, mu&s;t not deterr us from &s;o advantagious an enter|prize,
<PB N="2" REF="6"> there wanting thereunto nothing but a <HI>Re&s;o|lution of the powerful Undertaker.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince that word <HI>Undertaker</HI> is fallen from my Pen, it mu&s;t pa&s;s for a principle with me, That &s;uch great and publick Works are not to be attempted by private men, or any particular Cor|poration, But mo&s;t fit it were, that the <HI>State</HI> it &s;elf &s;hould be the &s;ole Undertaker, performing all at its own proper charge; and &s;o may ju&s;tly &s;ettle upon every &s;uch Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>a Revenue to the Common-wealth for ever.</HI></P>
<P>But before any particular Work in this kinde be Re&s;olved upon, the Expence is to be weighed, with the Benefits to the publick; and the&s;e laid in equal balance, it will &s;oon appear, Whether that one particular De&s;ign, will be profitable or not.</P>
<P>To clear this, a &s;uppo&s;ed In&s;tance may be made in the Citizens of the noble City of <HI>Salisbu|ry,</HI> as humbly making &s;uit, That their <HI>Avon</HI> fal|ling into the Sea at <HI>Chri&s;tchurch,</HI> might be open|ed to &s;mall flat-bottom Ve&s;&s;els, Billanders of 30 Tun, which Loaden, draw only three foot and a half Water; and this as well for the Sea, and its Commodities to be imported, as for the ea&s;ier carrying down the Fruits of <HI>Mendip</HI>-Hills, and of all that part of the We&s;t, to all tho&s;e parts below, which &s;tand in &s;o much need thereof.</P>
<P>The Charge mu&s;t be looked into with the Pro|fits: and though the Expence might &s;eem great, yet mu&s;t it not affright the publick <HI>Undertaker:</HI> For be&s;ides the high Obligation this &s;hould lay up|on
<PB N="3" REF="6"> the City of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and all tho&s;e adjacent parts, for &s;o great and everla&s;ting a Gift, which to a <HI>State</HI> ought to be a prevalent motive: The <HI>State</HI> it &s;elf might al&s;o reflect upon the benefit not only to the people, but al&s;o to its own Revenue accruing by that Navigable pa&s;&s;age, &s;ettled upon the Common|wealth for ever: It being a known maxime of State, that <HI>by what the People, by the &s;ame the Government groweth rich.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it mu&s;t be thought that the de&s;ires of the people in the in&s;tance before cited, were groun|ded upon apparent benefits conceived.</P>
<P>This Example may &s;erve for all other &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages by water aimed at, the which ought to be made as apparently beneficial, as feazible: the Charge, as hath been &s;aid, being fit for <HI>no Under|taker, but the State it &s;elf:</HI> and the more &s;uch Navi|gable pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould Meander and winde within the Land, &s;till would the benefit more and more ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Rivers may be compared to States-men &s;ent abroad; they are never out of their way: &s;o they pa&s;s by great Cities, Marts, Courts of Princes, Armies, Leaguers, Diets, and the like Theaters of Action, which &s;till contribute to the increa&s;e of their Ob&s;ervation; So Navigable Rivers, the more places of Note they pa&s;s by, the more they take up, or bring; &s;till gleaning one Commodity or other from the Soyl they pa&s;s through, and are &s;upplied by every Town they touch at with imploy|ment</P>
<P>The Benefites which will evidently ari&s;e by o|pening of &s;uch Rivers in this Common. wealth
<PB N="4" REF="7"> <HI>as &s;hall be found beneficially capable of Navigation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bacon</HI> in his Natural Hi&s;to|ry calleth the&s;e the riche&s;t Mines above ground.</NOTE> are numerous and great; of which &s;ome few we will her touch.</P>
<P>By this indu&s;try, as it increa&s;eth, will be rai&s;ed many thou&s;and of Watermen, fit at any time to be taken into the &s;ervice <HI>of the State,</HI> and what wa|terman will not think hem&s;elf highly advanced, to come out of a River into the Sea; out of a <HI>Bil|lander, into a man of War,</HI> who&s;e con&s;tant pay will be far greater, and who&s;e imployment will be of much more credit, and carry it with more hope of prefer|ment. Hence al&s;o many thou&s;ands of Hor&s;e, now on|ly u&s;ed for Packs and Burthens, would be &s;pared, &amp; our Studderies more capable for Warlike &s;ervice, and the feeding of &s;mall Tits imployed upon impro|vable &s;tocks.</P>
<P>The facility of Commerce from one place to a+nother, and the cheapne&s;s of tran&s;portation of Commodities, without &s;o much grinding and plowing up our high-wayes, which maketh them now in many places &s;o impa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>You &s;hall &s;ee We&s;tern waggons, which they call Plows, carry forty hundred weight; in&s;omuch as between <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Marlborough,</HI> they have been en|forced at a Hill they call <HI>Bagdown-hill,</HI> to put twen|ty Bea&s;ts, Hor&s;e and Oxen, to draw it up. This great abu&s;e, by this means would be taken away, by keeping our High-wayes plea&s;ant; and withal, by this tran&s;portation of Commodities by Rivers, the price of Commodities would fall.</P>
<P>The Impo&s;ition, though ea&s;ie, laid upon every &s;uch Navigable pa&s;&s;age, would, as Rivers by de|grees are opened, amount to a fair revenue, without
<PB N="5" REF="7"> any grievance at all to the people, but rather with much comfort, as it is imbraced in other Countries, where they cannot live without the help of the&s;e Billanders, pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing daily from Town to Town, from Market to Market, and from Coa&s;t to Coa&s;t; The&s;e are onely &s;ome few of &s;o many benefits, which will re&s;ult from the opening of our Rivers.</P>

<P>If any other River, practicable for Boats, lye neer the head, or &s;ide of the &s;aid River, and that the ground favour the opening of a &s;till River to be drawn between them, then to joyn them with Sa&s;&s;es, <HI>alias</HI> Locks, or otherwi&s;e.

<P>How facile a thing it were from <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> ly|ing upon the &s;aid River, to open a pa&s;&s;age for the&s;e Billanders of 30 Tun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Were the Bil|landers to carry 40 chal|dron, 250 of them would carry 10000 Chaldron at one Voyage.</NOTE> which draw Water but three foot and half, loaden, into the River <HI>I&s;is,</HI> by <HI>Creek-lade</HI> and <HI>Letchlad,</HI> and &s;o into the <HI>Thames,</HI> all that Land-pa&s;&s;age being not fully 3 miles (inviting the <HI>Undertaker</HI>) being very low, and practicable ground, mo&s;t fit for the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age opened, the proffits to the <HI>State,</HI> would ri&s;e to a va&s;t Sum, and far greater then that of <HI>Coal.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="11">
<P>By this means there would be a <HI>Mediterranean</HI> pa&s;&s;age opened from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to <HI>London</HI> by Water.</P>
<P>Not only for the &s;upply of much <HI>Coal</HI> in time of nece&s;&s;ity, but for all other Commodities brought into <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which in time of Ho&s;tility <HI>London</HI> could not otherwi&s;e enjoy, but by exce&s;&s;ive Rates for Land-carriages, or Convoyes by Sea: but by this Pa&s;&s;age once opened, all Commodities may be brought from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to <HI>London</HI> (even at one Farthing <HI>per</HI> ponnd) we now paying all the Win|ter-time for carriage by Land between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> 4 <HI>s. per cent.</HI></P>
<P>Our Forreign Vintage never permitting us to bring home Wines till the beginning of <HI>November</HI> when our Channel is very dangerous, the Mer|chant would be glad to &s;ecure his Voyage by this <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Pa&s;&s;age by unloading his Wines at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> without any further hazard.</P>
<P>The whole Charge of this Navigable Pa&s;&s;age would be paid with the proffits of the fir&s;t year: And as for <HI>Coal</HI> for 2 <HI>s.</HI> more upon the <HI>London</HI> Chaldron for Fraight, they al&s;o this way would be brought to <HI>London</HI> at 20 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> the Chaldron, <HI>London</HI> Chaldron.

<P>It were good that the 2 <HI>d.</HI> upon every Chaldron were paid towards the defraying of the Salaries of

<P>This Pa&s;&s;age in time of Peace might be u&s;ed for Tran&s;portation of Merchandize to <HI>London,</HI> and from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> only from the fir&s;t of <HI>Octo|ber</HI> to the fir&s;t of <HI>April;</HI> partly not to ob&s;truct our Navigation by Sea, all the Summer-time, when the doubling of the Cape of <HI>Cornwal</HI> is not danger|ous, nor our Coa&s;ts &s;o &s;ubject to &s;torms: And partly by rea&s;on of the <HI>Avon,</HI> and <HI>I&s;is,</HI> and the <HI>Thames</HI> it &s;elf in tho&s;e Winter-months will not want Water, which in the Summer they do, unle&s;s other Rivers be let into them, which cannot be done without more Charge: And for <HI>Coal,</HI> our Seas being not infe&s;ted, none &s;hould pa&s;&s;e higher then <HI>Malmsbury</HI> and <HI>Calne,</HI> not to hinder, as hath been &s;aid, our Navigation, for that Commodity by Sea, which mu&s;t &s;till be endeavoured to be kept up to the full.</P>
<P>Now who &s;hould be the <HI>Undertaker</HI> of this great Work, but <HI>the State</HI> it &s;elf? it being too great an Expence for any private man or Corporation to lay out; and of too great a Profit for them to re|ceive, being effected.</P>

<P>Many Sa&s;&s;es are to be made upon this River of <HI>Avon,</HI> it being &s;o much a Falling-water, in&s;omuch it is now forced to be kept up with many Dams, every one of which mu&s;t have his Sa&s;&s;e, but not upon the Dam, but upon the &s;ide of it.</P>
<P><HI>The Propo&s;er of this</HI> Paper <HI>hath no other in|tere&s;t in this De&s;ign, then a true Patriot ought to

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Highne&s;s.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THus I &s;hall &s;tate the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e which at pre&s;ent I intend to pre&s;ent to your powerful hand, and under your po|tent Protection to the whole Commonwealth, the which Work is even already fra|med to the end intended; that is, Nature having &s;o bountifully concurred with her own endeavours to the effecting thereof, in undergoing the greate&s;t charge, which commonly is the chiefe&s;t &s;top in all bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of this nature.</P>
<P>The flouri&s;hing Havens of <HI>Lyn</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth</HI> being &s;o Portuous, &s;o much frequented with Shipping, and &s;o plyed with Trade, it is apparent that the two
<PB N="6" REF="14"> Counties adjoyning, <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> receive much comfort thereby, being more indulgently dealt with|al by their two Havens then remoter parts, as particu|larly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their importations, furni&s;hed by that means with many Forreign commodities, which come flowing into tho&s;e Ports.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Rivers above named, the <HI>little Ow&s;e</HI> and <HI>Waveney,</HI> running as it were between the two Ha|vens, and in a manner dividing tho&s;e two Counties, were they opened for Navigation, would very much encrea&s;e the benefit both to tho&s;e Haven Towns, in venting of tho&s;e their Importations, as al&s;o prove a great ea&s;e to the &s;aid two Counties to have &s;o facile, and cheap a pa&s;&s;age made to bring tho&s;e Commodities unto them, and withal thereby to vent what they pro|duce of their own.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Rivers are &s;o favourably ca&s;t by Na|ture, as in the Winter (when they will be mo&s;t for u&s;e) the Heads of them already almo&s;t meet, at a place called <HI>Loppham Bridge,</HI> where a Navigable Channel being cut, (in length le&s;&s;e than a mile) the two Rivers would joyn for mutual Commerce from <HI>Lynn</HI> to <HI>Yarmouth;</HI> and withal Boats might re&s;t at a|ny place of the&s;e Rivers, there to make their Maga|zins of &s;uch Forreign Importations, as the Countries adjoyning &s;tand in need of; others might touch at e|very Market Town, there &s;tanding at the lea&s;t &s;ix or &s;e|ven upon, or very neer adjoyning to the &s;aid Rivers; and within di&s;tance of ten miles, very many Market Towns more, the which in the end of this Paper I &s;hall &s;et down, with their &s;everal di&s;tances from tho&s;e two Rivers; which Rivers I ob&s;erve to lie &s;o neer upon a <HI>Level,</HI> as few <HI>Sa&s;&s;es</HI> will be required, to le&s;&s;en the
<PB N="7" REF="14"> charge. What a ble&s;&s;ing and ea&s;e would this afford to all the Inhabitants neer adjoyning, upon all Mar|ket daies (as they do in <HI>Flanders</HI>) to carry them|&s;elves, and their Commodities by Water (avoyding tho&s;e deep waies in the Winter &s;ea&s;on, e&s;pecially on <HI>Suffolk</HI> &s;ide) from Town to Town, from Market to Market, at &s;uch rates, as will not be con&s;iderable, if compared to their charge, and trouble in going by Hor&s;e or Cart?</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages for the increa&s;e of Commerce; and Trade, your Highne&s;s wi&s;dom will &s;oon pene|trate, and give heat unto, by your potent approbati|on, your Highne&s;s being generally ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t zealous in the &s;etting forward of Trade, taking &s;o much to heart the increa&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>Neither doth this De&s;ign of mine contain it &s;elf within the verge of the afore&s;aid two Rivers, nor in the advance of Trade brought into tho&s;e great Havens of <HI>Lynn</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> but it reacheth higher, and extends to the uniting the In-land-Commerce upon Rivers between the North and Ea&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> there being no ob&s;tacle (were the&s;e two Rivers opened for Navigation) no hinderance at all, but that which our carele&s;ne&s;s hath negligently ca&s;t a&s;ide, and made no u&s;e of for many years) to impead our Na|vigation upon Rivers within the Land, from the Ha|ven of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to the Citie of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, (as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> well ob&s;er|veth in his de&s;cription of <HI>Lincolne &s;hire</HI>) cut a Chan|nel for the &s;pace of &s;even miles from <HI>Tork&s;ea</HI> upon the <HI>Trent</HI> down to the Citie of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> there to joyn with the River <HI>Witham,</HI> which falling into the Haven
<PB N="8" REF="15"> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> comes through the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Ely,</HI> into the&s;e our two Rivers the <HI>Little Ow&s;e</HI> and <HI>Waveney,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;aith, this gallant King cau|&s;ed that memorable work of &s;even miles to be ca&s;t up for the benefit of his City of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> though other Writers &s;peak of a mixt intention therein, as partly to facilitate his own <HI>Removes</HI> from one part of the Kingdome to another, he being the fir&s;t King who brought <HI>Progre&s;&s;es</HI> into fa&s;hion, &s;o making his people equally participant of him, that they might &s;ee and know him better by him&s;elf, than by his picture.</P>
<P>He was an active and wi&s;e Prince, and as all Ru|lers of States have ever their de&s;igns headed with &s;eve|ral ends; &s;o might this King in this very work; as up|on any forreign inva&s;ion, or dome&s;tick in&s;urrection, to tran&s;port from one &s;ide of the Kingdom to another his Army, without grievance to his people for billet|ing of his Souldiers through the Country as they pa&s;|&s;ed, or tyring out his men with long Marches, but to have them ready for action upon a moment; for by this very work of his of &s;even miles, cut out for Na|vigation, (conjoyned to what Nature before had wrought) he might have tran&s;ported an Army by Water, all within the Land from the Ea&s;t part of <HI>Eng|land</HI> into the North, without the lea&s;t noi&s;e of landing, and have been upon his Enemies before they dreampt of him, in this &s;ilent and covered way. How&s;oever his ends were, it was a noble Work, and a Gift worthy to come from a Crown, it being <HI>the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident that I have found in England of joyning Rivers for Naviga|tion,</HI> which &s;howeth (even then) how forward, and prone toward Improvement this Kingdom was.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="15">
<P>But what an nnworthy neglect thereof hath been in the&s;e latter times, I blu&s;h to write! To let it fall, to be of no u&s;e, and the Work (though yet extant) to lye empty, wa&s;t, and dry, far from the intention of the Royal giver! in &s;o much as now Sheep, and Cattel graze, where formerly Barks have &s;ayled, and perhaps a King in them.</P>
<P>This Work, or Channel of 7 miles, commonly called <HI>Fo&s;&s;e Dike,</HI> were it repaired, and the Banks in &s;ome places made up, would ea&s;ily again be made capable of Navigation, and revive that &s;afe, rich, and large extended Commerce, which by that means did formerly &s;pread it &s;elf within the Land, and would open the pa&s;&s;age for Boats, as hath been &s;aid, between <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to the un&s;peakable comfort of very many Towns and Villages lying near, and upon the Pa&s;&s;age, and would yield a general benefit both to the Ea&s;t and North of <HI>England,</HI> and by participation all <HI>England</HI> over.</P>
<P>It hath been ob&s;erved upon <HI>Level</HI> taken, that the <HI>Trent</HI> lyeth lower than <HI>Fo&s;&s;e Dike</HI> by Two Foot, or thereabouts, &s;o that of nece&s;&s;ity in that place there mu&s;t be <HI>A Sa&s;&s;e</HI> to draw up, and let down the Boats. And in|deed if we look upon our Sea Coa&s;ts of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> they are &s;o wanting of Harbours, and of places to relieve Ships in, in time of &s;tre&s;&s;e, e&s;pe|cially upon a &s;trong Ea&s;terly Wind, as I may well term them importuous, for any Ships of Burden, &s;o that in the Winter time (when our Inland pa&s;&s;age will be mo&s;t in play) the great frequented Haven of <HI>Hull</HI> will be willing to &s;erve it &s;elf with the&s;e Rivers Navi|gable, for the more &s;afe conduct of their Merchandize into the Ea&s;t parts of <HI>England.</HI> And &s;eeing our For|reign Vintage never comes into our dangerous Chan|nel
<PB N="10" REF="16"> till the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> in my judgment he were a de&s;perate Merchant who will adventure Men, Ship, and Goods in &s;ayling farther North, when he might &s;ecure all by unloading at <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and making u&s;e of this &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age upon Rivers, even up to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, and the further advantages of this &s;ecure Tran&s;portation of all Commodities within the Land upon Rivers, between the North and Ea&s;t of <HI>England</HI> all the Winter &s;ea&s;on (when the Coa&s;t is &s;o dangerous) I need not any further &s;et forth to your Highne&s;s, who&s;e Wi&s;dom will &s;oon imbrace them all, and accor|dingly reflect upon them to the benefit of the publick.</P>
<P>One thing I had almo&s;t omitted, among&s;t the many helps which the opening for Navigation of the&s;e Two Rivers between <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> would afford tho&s;e Counties, that is, the &s;upply of <HI>Fuel,</HI> which by this means may be brought unto them with great facility; <HI>Sea Coal</HI> now &s;upplying the defects of our <HI>Wood,</HI> &s;o much the&s;e latter years con&s;umed, and I may well &s;ay de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>And were <HI>Fo&s;&s;e Dike</HI> repaired for Navigation (which now lieth wa&s;te) what a recruit would that al&s;o bring to all the Ea&s;t parts of <HI>England,</HI> by Tran&s;porting this way <HI>out of Nottingham-&s;hire, Darby-&s;hire, &amp; Leice&s;ter-&s;hire, Pitt Coal</HI> (which in Forrein parts they call <HI>Scots Coal</HI>) which in abundance might be fetched by the help of this pa&s;&s;age?</P>
<P>Though in this very point <HI>Caution</HI> were to be had, that no &s;uch <HI>Coal</HI> &s;hould be carried out of tho&s;e Coun|ties this way, but from Pitts new &s;unk, and from pla|ces where <HI>Coals</HI> have not been &s;ought. That the inhabi|tants of tho&s;e parts &s;hould not &s;uffer by this exportati|on: And I &s;hall make evident to your Highne&s;s, That there are indeficient Mynes of this <HI>Coal</HI> to &s;upply this

<P>Moreover at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> (where they mu&s;t pa&s;s) there might be a <HI>Magazine</HI> for that <HI>Coal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But much fitter for us to do it, for increa&s;e of our Ship|ping.</NOTE> either for us to Tran&s;port, or for Forreiners to fetch them there, which would rai&s;e a very great <HI>Revenue</HI> to the State, that <HI>Coal</HI> being &s;old in Forrein parts by weight, at very high Rates.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> Paper <HI>out of my bounden Re&s;pect, and Duty to your Highne&s;s, I offer unto your Prudence and deep Con|&s;ideraiion, I conceiving it to contain matter of very great Honour to your Highne&s;s, and no le&s;s benefit and comfort to the whole Common Wealth.</HI></P>
