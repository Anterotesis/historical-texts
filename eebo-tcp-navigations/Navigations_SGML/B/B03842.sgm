<L><HI>A</HI> Beggar, a Beggar,</L>
<L>A Beggar I'le bee.</L>
<L>There's none leads a Life &s;o jocond as h&eacute;e;</L>
<L>A Beggar I was</L>
<L>And a Beggar I am,</L>
<L>a Begger Ile be, from a Begger I came:</L>
<L>If (as it begins) our Trading do fall,</L>
<L>I fear (at the la&s;t) we &s;hall be Beggers all</L>
<L><HI>Our Trades-men mi&s;carry in all their Affayrs,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And few men grow wealthy, but Courtiers and Players</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Craver my Father,</L>
<L>A Maunder my Mother,</L>
<L>A Filer my Si&s;ter, a Filcher my Brother,</L>
<L>A Cauter my Unckle</L>
<L>That car'd not for Pelfe;</L>
<L>a Lifter my Aunt, a Begger my &s;elfe;</L>
<L>in white wheaten-&s;traw, when their bellies were full,</L>
<L>Then I was begot, between Tinker &amp; Trul</L>
<L><HI>And therefore a Begger, a Begger I'le be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For none hath a &s;pirit &s;o jocond as he.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>When Boyes do come to us,</L>
<L>And that their intent is</L>
<L>to follow out Calling, we nere bind them Prentice</L>
<L>Soon as they come too't,</L>
<L>We teach them to doo't</L>
<L>and give them a &s;taff, &amp; a Wallet to boo't,</L>
<L>We teach them their Lingua, to crave and to Cant,</L>
<L>The devil is in them, if then they can want,</L>
<L><HI>If any are here, that Beggers will bee,</HI></L>
<L><HI>We without Indentures will make them free.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We begg for our bread,</L>
<L>But &s;ometimes it happens,</L>
<L>we fea&s;t it with Pigg, Pullet, Couny and Capons,</L>
<L>For Churches Affairs,</L>
<L>We are no Men-&s;layers;</L>
<L>We have no Religion, yet live by our Pra|yers</L>
<L>But if when we begg, Men will not draw their pur&s;es,</L>
<L>We charge &amp; give fire, with a vally of cur&s;es</L>
<L><HI>The Devil confound your good wor&s;hip we cry</HI></L>

<HEAD>The &s;econd Part, To the &s;ame Tune,</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>We do Things in &s;ea&s;on,</L>
<L>And have &s;o much Rea&s;on,</L>
<L>we rai&s;e no Rebellion, nor never talk Trea|&s;on.</L>
<L>We Billet our mates</L>
<L>At very low Rates,</L>
<L>whil&s;t &s;ome k&eacute;epe their Quarters as high as the Gates</L>
<L>With <HI>Shinkin ap Morgan,</HI> with <HI>Blew-cap,</HI> or <HI>Tege,</HI></L>
<L>VVe enter into no <HI>Covenant,</HI> nor <HI>League:</HI></L>
<L><HI>And therefore a bonney bold Begger I'le be;</HI></L>
<L><HI>For none lives a life &s;o happy as he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VVe never do prate,</L>
<L>In matters of State,</L>
<L>For fear we &s;hould come to <HI>Hugh Peters</HI> his Fate</L>
<L>VVhil&s;t Scripture unfolders,</L>
<L>And Trea&s;on upholders,</L>
<L>Have lo&s;t their heads, we keep ours on our &s;houlders</L>
<L>Our Plots &amp; our Projects, are never &s;o tall</L>
<L>To reach to the Top-ma&s;t of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall</HI></L>
<L><HI>And therefore a merry brave Begger I'le be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For none wears his Nodle &s;o &s;afely as he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For &s;uch petty Pledges,</L>
<L>As Shirts from the Hedges,</L>
<L>we are not in fear to be drawn upon Sledges</L>
<L>But &s;ometimes the VVhip,</L>
<L>Doth make us to skip,</L>
<L>And then we from Tything to Tything do trip,</L>
<L>For when in a poor hou&s;ing-ken we do bib it</L>
<L>VVe &s;tand more in awe of the Stocks then the Gibbet:</L>
<L><HI>And therefore a merry mad Begger I'le be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For when it is night, to the Barn goes he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VVe throw down no Alter,</L>
<L>Nor ever do falter</L>
<L>So much, as to change a Gold-Chain, for a Halter:</L>
<L>Though &s;ome men do flout us;</L>
<L>And others do doubt us,</L>
<L>we nere go without forty peices about us;</L>
<L>But many brave fellows are fine &amp; look fiercer</L>
<L>That owe for their Cloths to the Taylor and Mercer:</L>
<L><HI>And if from the Stocks I can keep out my feet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I fear not the <HI>Compter, Kings-bench</HI> nor the <HI>Fleet.</HI></HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes I do frame,</L>
<L>My &s;elf to be lame;</L>
<L>and when a coach comes, I do hop to my game:</L>
<L>VVe &s;eldome miscarry,</L>
<L>Yet never do Marry,</L>
<L>By the Gowns Common-Prayer, nor the Cloak Directory,</L>
<L>But <HI>Harry &amp; Mary</HI> (like birds of a feather)</L>
<L>do nothing but ki&s;s, laugh, &amp; lye down together</L>
<L><HI>Like Piggs in the pea&s;e-&s;traw, intangld they lie</HI></L>
<L><HI>Till there they beget &s;uch a bold Rogue as I.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To &s;umme all in brief,</L>
<L>VVe live by relief,</L>
<L>And pray for King <HI>Charles,</HI> our Commander in chief:</L>
<L>God ble&s;s all the Peers,</L>
<L>The wi&s;e Over-&s;eers,</L>
<L>that they may con&s;ider the poore <HI>Cavaliers,</HI></L>
<L>For if they let them but lower to fall,</L>
<L>The'l take our profe&s;&s;ion &amp; begger us all:</L>
<L><HI>And then it will be but a folly for me,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A merry &s;oul'd, bonny bold Begger to be.</HI></L>
