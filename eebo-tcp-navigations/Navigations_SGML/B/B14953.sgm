<HEAD>From <HI>Stetin</HI> the last of July, <HI>Stilo vet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe King of Sweden having defeated the Im|periall regiments, I wrote of in my la&s;t, re|tired againe and &s;atisfied his Campe the be&s;t he could, for he knew <HI>Tilly</HI> would not long tarry but come and vi&s;ite him. But be|fore <HI>Tilly</HI> came on him&s;elfe hee had &s;ent certaine &s;pies, and &s;ent word to &s;ome other he had in the Kings army, to do him &s;uch &s;eruice as he thought would a&s;&s;ure him of the totall victory over the King. They therefore having undertaken to naile the Ordnance of the Kings Campe, at lea&s;t towards that part where <HI>Tilly</HI> had e&s;pe|cially commanded it, and by that meanes make the &s;ame quite u&s;ele&s;&s;e for the King when he &s;hould mo&s;t have need of it, one of tho&s;e &s;pies or traytors feeling &s;ome remor&s;e in his con&s;ci|ence, di&s;covered the plot to the King and was cau&s;e that the other were apprehended. Now <HI>Tilly</HI> hoping things were per|formed according to his plea&s;ure, beganne to di&s;charge his great Ordnance again&s;t the Kings quarter, and having &s;pent aboue 60. &s;hots, yet he did no harme thereby, except that one &s;hot carried away the head from the &s;houlders of a gentleman that having &s;erued <HI>Tilly</HI> had but a few dayes before beene ta|ken pri&s;oner, and an arme from another &s;ouldier. For the King having put things in order did endure all without making one &s;hot in an&s;were, whereby <HI>Tilly</HI> was the more a&s;&s;ured in his hope and re&s;olution, and therefore he &s;ent on &s;ome of his troopes to attempt the Kings trenches, where they found no
<PB N="2" REF="3">great re&s;i&s;tance, which <HI>Tilly</HI> &s;eeing, he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould quickly force and take all that quarter, and to that end advanced and pre&s;&s;ed on with his army, when on a &s;udden the Kings ordnance playd at once among&s;t the &s;ame, and with chaine &s;hot and what other &s;hot el&s;e was thought fitte&s;t to de&s;tructi|on, made a great butchery of <HI>Tillies</HI> army; And the King at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;ent forth <HI>Baudis</HI> with three regiments of Hor&s;e, who &s;et &s;o rudely into <HI>Tillies</HI> Curra&s;&s;eers, that he &s;lew a great many and turned them to flight; And it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that if the King had &s;econded him with the re&s;t of his army, he would have defeated all his enemies, and few would have e&s;|caped. Thus <HI>Tilly</HI> having &s;ped no better in this his reuenge, then his Vantgard had done before him, made his retreat, which was not much unlike unto a running away, leaving a number of his men pri&s;oners and more &s;laine behinde him.</P>
<P>Vpon the 28. of Iuly, my Lord <HI>Marquis Hamilton</HI> arri|ved with all his fleete joyfully at <HI>Stral&s;unt,</HI> and all his men were in good health.

<P>The plague bginnes to be very furious in Sile&s;ia, but yet notwith&s;tanding the Emperour hath given order to make an army there al&s;o again&s;t the King of Sweden, which &s;hall con|&s;i&s;t of 15000. men, and the &s;aid army is already very &s;trong, and hath this great while be&s;iedged the Swedes in Cro&s;&s;en, but have as yet done them no harme. The King of Sweden hath &s;ent for his forces that were in Sile&s;ia to come to him, and thereby it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;aid King and <HI>Tilly,</HI> who is &s;omewhat retired back, untill his army be reinforced againe, will not part, before they give one another a bloody battell. And at the Citty of Hall, all the water of the ditches about the towne was of late turned all into blood, and hath beene &s;eene by many hundred men of good &s;ort who doe averre the &s;ame.
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">Be&s;ides this on the la&s;t day of Iuly la&s;t in the afternoone, there happened in the&s;e Countries an exceeding great &s;torme, and e&s;pecially along the Elbe and about Magdenburgh, where it was &s;o great, that the violence of the wind had certainly carried both <HI>Tilly</HI> him&s;elfe with his tent and pavillion, &s;tan|ding not very farre from Werben, away into the Elbe, had he not beene re&s;cued and &s;aved by his attendants and Soul|diers.</P>

<P><HI>Tilly</HI> being much di&s;plea&s;ed at the lo&s;&s;e of the Cavalry which were defeated by the King of Sweden on the 27^t^h. of Iuly, did breath nothing but revenge again&s;t Sweden, and therefore having advanceed with his maine army towards the King of Sweden, he had &s;everall enterpri&s;es and gave many on&s;ets and a&s;&s;aults again&s;t the Kings Campe, which was well fortified and provided, as that King is accu&s;tomed to doe where&s;oever he doth encampe him&s;elfe. <HI>Tilly</HI> &s;eeing he could not doe any great matter again&s;t him by force, did v&s;e al&s;o &s;ome other plots, to bereave the King of the u&s;e of his ordnance, Where|by the King did mightily annoy him, and having &s;ome &s;ecret inteligence with &s;ome &s;ouldiers that &s;erved the King, he cor|rupted them to naile the &s;aid ordnance again&s;t St. <HI>Iames</HI> day, which day <HI>Tilly</HI> intended to a&s;&s;ault the Kings Campe. But one of tho&s;e &s;ouldiers or Traytors di&s;covered the matter unto the King, who keeping it &s;ecret, gave order for that dayes worke, on which <HI>Tilly</HI> began to play with his great Ordnance di&s;charging about 80. &s;hots, during which time no an&s;wer nor &s;hot was made from the Kings Campe. Therefore <HI>Tilly</HI> &s;ent &s;ome of his hor&s;e to skirmi&s;h, who came under the Kings ord|nance, but yet were not &s;hot at except by &s;ome mu&s;quetiers, which the King &s;uffered now and then to give fire again&s;t them; <HI>Tilly</HI> &s;eeing no ordnance play again&s;t him, &s;uppo&s;ed that indeed the Kings ordnance had beene nailed, and there|upon gave a furious a&s;&s;ault upon the Campe. Then the King cau&s;ed his ordnance on a &s;udden to play through the midde&s;t of the Imperiali&s;ts. And &s;oone after he made a fally with his
<PB N="4" REF="4">hor&s;e and &s;ome of his Infantery, and forced the Imperiali&s;ts to withdraw into their owne quarters. The two next dayes one after another <HI>Tilly</HI> tryed againe his fortune again&s;t the King of Sweden, but he was alwaies &s;o well received, that at la&s;t his men had no more minde to come on, but retiring were by the Swedi&s;h forces that followed them, e&s;pecially by the Swedi&s;h dragoners &s;o overha&s;tened, that many lo&s;t their lives, and left behind them a great number of their Waggons, bag|gage and peeces of ordnance. <HI>Tilly</HI> retired into Magdenburgh, and what he will now doe is not knowne; he &s;ends for forces to joyne with him, which daily come marching from &s;everall places. The King doth the like; Some thinke <HI>Tilly</HI> will make an attempt about the river of Havel, but long he cannot &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, for the King hath his provi&s;ions and victualls comming to him without any let, where <HI>Tilly</HI> hath none but what is brought very farre downe from Germany to his army, where there is already &s;uch a dearth, that a loafe of bread co&s;ts a Flo|rin of gold, which is a french crowne; whereby it is thought <HI>Tilly</HI> mu&s;t either goe backe againe or tarrying but a while lon|ger, &s;uffer extreamity.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Prage</HI> the <HI>4.</HI> of Augu&s;t Stil nouo.</HEAD>
<P>It is certaine that the King of Sweden hath defeated on the 17. of Iuly la&s;t at night, foure whole Imperiall Regiments, &s;laying a great number, and among the &s;ame Collonell <HI>Bern|&s;tein,</HI> for whom there is heere made great lamentation, but more e&s;pecially by his Si&s;ter, becau&s;e he was the la&s;t of his family. <HI>Montecuculy</HI> we do heare was not pre&s;ent, being then in Sile&s;ia; But his regiment was wholly defeated, and parti|cularly three Companies thereof were all &s;laine &s;o that not one man thereof e&s;caped. There e&s;caped &s;ome few with &s;uch a &s;wiftne&s;&s;e, that they left all they had behind, running away in their &s;hirts, as they came out of their beds. We cannot know the trueth of all particulars, but &s;ome of them confe&s;&s;e, they lo&s;t at the lea&s;t about tenne Cornets and foure En&s;ignes, and withall all their baggage.

<P>Meane while the army that the Emperour hath in Sile&s;ia, having not done any thing yet worthy of relation is now to be augmented, and to that end there are &s;ent out of Bohemia, 5000. men, gathered in this kingdome and in Moravia.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is an apparent and naked truth. That the Burgama&s;ters, councel, and Citizens of the City <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">burgh</HI> could in no wi&s;e be drawn and per&s;waded to disbur&s;e a rea&s;o|nable &s;umme of money, (upon good a&s;&s;urance) for the ad|vancement of the levying and rai&s;ing of forces, for his Maie|&s;ty of Sweden, tending to the reliefe and deliverance of the &s;aid di&s;tre&s;&s;ed itty in particular, and reducement of the com|mon Germain Liberties and Priviledges, in generall. Much le&s;&s;e would they any wi&s;e con&s;ent and permit, the lea&s;t quarter or billetting to his Maie&s;ty and his grace the Admini&s;trators of Magdenburgh, their conjoyned forces; till at the la&s;t, by rea|&s;on of the enemies blocking of them up, this la&s;t &s;iedge, they were compelled thereunto.</P>
<P>Which was the cau&s;e, that both the hor&s;e and foot-forces
<PB N="8" REF="6">neyther might, nor would aggregate, in &s;uch a compleat num|ber, and &s;o opportunely as both they could haue done, and was requi&s;ite, in&s;omuch that the enemy gained conueniency and opportunity to blocke up, and be&s;iedge the &s;aid Citty, by the meanes wherof his Mai. was of nece&s;&s;ity con&s;trained &s;omewhat to de&s;i&s;t, and his intention ayming at the generall and publike good, was thereby withdrawne, and exceedingly hindred.</P>
<P>But to the end, that all men may fully be acquainted with the cau&s;es which moved his Mai. to this re&s;olution to a&s;&s;emble a convenient and rea&s;onable army in that place afore mentio|ned. We mu&s;t know; that even than, where his Princely grace the Admini&s;trator of Magdenburgh, in the end of Iuly in the yeare pa&s;t 1630. came into the Citty, the whole Bi&s;hoprick of Magdenburg was very de&s;titute of Imperiall troupes, and fur|ni&s;hed with very weake garri&s;on. So that his Princely grace wanted no thing except the afore&s;aid monies for the rai&s;ing of &s;ouldiers; which if upon earne&s;t reque&s;t, and &s;oliciting of the &s;aid Citty Magdenburgh he could have obtained, in a very &s;hort &s;pace he might very ea&s;ily have rai&s;ed and a&s;&s;embled together certaine thou&s;ands of men, and by that meanes haue prevented and put by the &s;iedge, which <HI>Papenheym</HI> hath then begun with very few forces, yea he might than have diverted the whole State of that warre, have withdrawn all warlike provi&s;ion and nece&s;&s;aries from the enemy, and a&s;&s;embled his forces even with|in the Citty. He might al&s;o have built an inexpugnable fort or Tower, and have con&s;tituted <HI>Sedem Belli,</HI> to &s;econd, and de|fend all the adjacent places again&s;t the un&s;peakable Tyranny, and perceiving impo&s;itions of his adver&s;ary. And here we o|mit to &s;peake of all other important and many con&s;equences of warre. E&s;pecially, this is to be regarded, that this Citty by this meanes might &s;o long have bin pre&s;erved vntill his Mai. of Sweden had quite expelled and ruinated all the Emp. forces in Pomerania, and upon the river Oder. How&s;oever, the com|mon people of this Citty are in this matter very excu&s;able, who by rea&s;on of the potent favorites and traitors which the enemy had drawn to him in that Citty, were not able to pro|ceed with a couragious and manly re&s;olution. Which may &s;uf|ficiently appeare by the woefull and lamentable ruine of the
<PB N="9" REF="6">&s;aid Citty, which the treacherous Machination of tho&s;e tray|tors of their owne Countrey, brought upon the &s;ame, and is meerely to be imputed unto them, for in all this they have prevailed.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this, it may ea&s;ily appeare, and by tho&s;e Citties them&s;elves be made manife&s;t, what vigilant care and diligence his Mai. hath taken, and be&s;tirred him&s;elfe for the obtaining of the &s;aid monies by exchange from the Citty Hamburgh and Lubeck, and tran&s;ported the &s;ame to Magden|bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">gh, becau&s;e they, by rea&s;on of the Scituation of that place had not opportunity and could not furni&s;h &s;uch meanes, not|with&s;tanding it could be proved ea&s;ily, that it was not &s;o im|po&s;&s;ible for them as their excu&s;e would make it. So that this fault in the very fir&s;t beginning is not to be a&s;cribed to his Mai. nor his Princely grace the Admini&s;trator of Magden|burgh. But to tho&s;e traytors and founders of mi&s;chiefe on the one, and to their con&s;orts and adherents, who furni&s;hed the enemy with munition, provi&s;ion &amp;c. on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>And although that his Mai. &s;ince that time hath made ouer great &s;ummes of money for the maintenance of the &s;ouldiers, and al&s;o hath tran&s;ported much provi&s;ion and all warlike ne|ce&s;&s;aries to Magdenburgh, and promi&s;ed the &s;aid Citty his Kingly ayd and deliverance, at &s;everall times. Neverthele&s;&s;e tho&s;e that are acquainted and skilled in Pollitick and warlike affaires, doe know that tho&s;e kind of promi&s;es are regulated according to conveniencie, and according to the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ibility of men, and the &s;tate of things. And are not to be taken &s;o ab|&s;urdly, as if the Kings maie&s;ty of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t for &s;atisfaction of his promi&s;e made, endanger and hazard the common wel|fare, the deliverance of &s;o many hundred thou&s;and &s;oules and con&s;equently his whole royall State, his Kingdome and Coun|trey, or rather ruinate and utterly undoe the whole worke be|gunne, and leave all in a de&s;perate &s;tate and Condition. Where|as at the fir&s;t this Citty might ea&s;ily have bin holpen with the lea&s;t &s;upply. And yet furthermore we doe &s;hew and declare, that his Mai. notwith&s;tanding them aboue mentioned rea&s;ons hath u&s;ed and reached forth his be&s;t and extreame endeavour, to relieue and deliver this Citty, but hath bin hindered and
<PB N="10" REF="7">prevented, and kept back by &s;uch ob&s;tacles and hinderances, as were impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;hun. Which being demon&s;tra|ted we are fully per&s;waded that no man being unpartiall, and voyd of pa&s;&s;ion, and in his right &s;ences and temper, will any longer in this point accu&s;e and impute any cau&s;e unto his Ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P>It is well knowne, not onely to the whole Empire but throughout the whole Chri&s;tian world, that an huge Emperi|all army being enquartered in the two Dukedomes of Pomera|nia and Mechlenburgh, had than already cut off the pa&s;&s;age from the Ea&s;t-&s;ea to Magdenburgh, which great army in Champagne (e&s;pecially in hor&s;e forces) did farre exceed the army of his Maie&s;ty of Sweden, which was the cau&s;e that it proved impo&s;&s;ible for his Maie&s;ty with his weake Army to &s;trike thorough &s;o pui&s;&s;ant an Army, beeing enquartered in &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;age, and pa&s;&s;e quite thorough his Enemies the length of forty Dutch miles, unle&s;&s;e fir&s;t hee had confirmed him&s;elfe in &s;ome place, and had &s;ome footing in that &s;trange Countrey.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;ufficiently knowne, that notwith&s;tanding his Maie&s;ty u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible meanes, laboured as &s;oone as po&s;&s;ible might bee to advance his chiefe&s;t Troupes, and induct them into tho&s;e parts. Neverthele&s;&s;e, it was in the moneth No|vember, 1630. before the&s;e forces arrived.</P>
<P>Which, when hee had received and reduced into his army under him the whole cold Winter, ayming e&s;pecially to attaine to the deliverance of the &s;ayd City Magdenburgh. It is to bee doubted, whether or no, any man in &s;o rigid and &s;harpe a Winter, and in the midde&s;t of &s;o many inconveniences, and pa&s;&s;ing thorough &s;o many ob&s;tacles, hath ever effected &s;o much and in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace. For by meanes of this his Maie&s;ties incomparable labour in this hard time, it plea|&s;ed Almighty God, (from whom proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ds all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tory) to de|liver up into the hands of his Maie&s;ty with admirable victo|ry, tho&s;e two mighty pa&s;&s;ages of Gartz and Griffenhagen. Which if his Maie&s;ty had not obtained, it had bin impo&s;|&s;ible for him, and very unadvi&s;edly done, to have proceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d any farther, unle&s;&s;e his Maie&s;ty contrary to all rules a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d
<PB N="11" REF="7">In&s;tructions of warre, and contrary to rea&s;on and poli|ticke prudencie, would haue hazarded and endangered the common welfare and his owne &s;tate, and ruinated them both</P>
<P>Now by rea&s;on of this admirable victory which it plea|&s;ed Almighty God to afford his Maie&s;ty, he obtained &s;o much advantage of his Enemy, that he might ea&s;ily have fallen uppon the very head of him, and utterly rui|nated all his forces, and con&s;equently (by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance,) without great hinderance, or lo&s;&s;e have delivered the &s;aid Citty Magdenburgh. If his Maie&s;ty, could but have obtained the pa&s;&s;age and thoroughfare, through the &s;trong and mighty fortre&s;&s;e Cu&s;trin, which he &s;ought and required of the commander <HI>Krachten,</HI> who then commanded there, with earne&s;t intreaty and &s;upplication, upon good a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>Hereupon did follow very great inconveniences. His Maie&s;ty through want of victualls and furniture, was con|&s;trained to let his enemy e&s;cape and retire to Lantsbergh.</P>
<P>His Royall Army al&s;o by rea&s;on hereof happened into &s;e|verall dangers and extreamities. The Catholick blood-thir|&s;ty Enemy by this meanes was not ruinated, who otherwi&s;e was brought into a remedile&s;&s;e confu&s;ion. Neither could his Maie&s;ty wholly purge the River Elue, and all the Countrey betweene the Elue and the Ee&s;t-&s;ea, from the&s;e bloody and cruell Enemies. Much le&s;&s;e could his Maie&s;ty relieue and &s;e|cond the re&s;t of the Evangelicall Princes with a victorious hand. Who now are extreamely in danger to loo&s;e all &s;pi|rituall and temporall liberties and priviledges.</P>
<P>All the&s;e inconveniences did hence proceed, becau&s;e his Maie&s;ty could not obtain the afore&s;aid pa&s;&s;age of Cu&s;trin from the Commander <HI>Krachten.</HI></P>
<P>If any one object heere, that his Maje&s;ty ought to have conducted and brought his Army into his Enemies face the Generall <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lly,</HI> and rouzed him up with his Army. Wee have already &s;hewed, that his Maie&s;ties army, was exceedingly wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ied, and that whole winter grievou&s;ly weakened. And by rea&s;on of the refu&s;all of the pa&s;&s;age of Cu&s;trin, not onely
<PB N="12" REF="8">debilitated but decrea&s;ed, and therefore not capable and &s;uffici|ent to oppo&s;e &s;o great a power as <HI>Tilly</HI> than had. Neither did his Maj. hold it expedient and commendable, to proceed de&s;|perately and to hazard the whole matter in a dangerous fight. Which if it had not well &s;ucceeded, as apparently it might not, the good City <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> had fared never the better.</P>
<P>When <HI>Tilly</HI> was retired out of Pomerania and Mechlenburgh, than was the City <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> a&s;&s;aulted with the greate&s;t and extreame&s;t power, &s;o that it is in no wi&s;e to be imputed to his Maie&s;ty that the &s;ayd City was not delivered. Concerning the time while&s;t this &s;iedge did continue, it is not unknowne that the Emperors army being &s;trong before both of hor&s;e and foot, and having taken tho&s;e afore&s;aid pa&s;&s;ages by the <HI>Oder,</HI> did refortifie them&s;elves and adde unto their forces 12000. and came into a perfit &s;tate and po&s;ture, in the <HI>Nieumarck, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ker|marek,</HI> e&s;pecially at <HI>Francfort, Lantsb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">h,</HI> and the Countrey of <HI>Steynbergh,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Cro&s;&s;es.</HI> Moreover the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> with many thou&s;ands both foot and hor&s;e being enquar|tered on this &s;ide of the Elve and Mockeren, was very vigilant, and did duely attend all occa&s;ions. In&s;omuch that it was not plau&s;ible for his Maj. to leave &s;uch an Army as was before men|tioned behind his back, and meeting the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> by that meanes, to thru&s;t him&s;elfe between the doore and the hindge, <HI>Inter Malleum &amp; incunem.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, his Maje&s;t. of Sweden to &s;hew and manife&s;t his Chri&s;tian re&s;olution, and good intention for the re&s;toring and recovering of the Germaine liberties and privi|ledges of the Prote&s;tant Churches, &amp; for the di&s;charging of his Maje&s;ties Con&s;cience, and for his reputation, with a Heroicke courage did a&s;&s;ault the very heart of the whole Imperiall Army within the City <HI>Francfort,</HI> than being at lea&s;t 700<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">. &s;trong. Where, with extraordinary victory (which it plea&s;ed God in re&s;pect of his Chri&s;tian intention to afford him) hee defeated, overcame, and utterly ruinated them, &s;o that now hee had no &s;uch cau&s;e more to feare his enemy behind him. How&s;oever this is to be con&s;idered, that in a very &s;hort &s;pace 6000. men were againe recollected together, under the Co~mander <HI>Schou|wenburgh</HI> at great Glogau in Sile&s;ia, which 6000. men by all
<PB N="13" REF="8">likelihood, by rea&s;on of the confluxe of many forces from Sile|fia, Mehren, Bohemia, and Hungaria, might have beene excee|dingly augmented.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, but di&s;regarding all this, as al&s;o that Ge|nerall <HI>Tilly</HI> could ea&s;ily adjoyne his forces to the re&s;t, tran&s;por|ting them over the Elve by meanes of the Bridge layd neere unto <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> his Maj. did &s;o much re&s;pect, and tender the good City <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> that not fearing the great danger after good deliberation, him&s;elfe in per&s;on, with his whole Army marched to Berlyn, there to obtaine the &s;trong fort Span|dau, to the end that his Maj. in time of nece&s;&s;ity might have a &s;ure retreat. Which having obtained, his Maj. proceeded for|ward on the way to Potzdam, hoping that whereas the &s;aving of the City <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> did &s;o deeply concerne the Prince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lector of Saxony, that his Princely Excellence would a&s;&s;i&s;t him with &s;ome troupes and certaine pieces of Ordnance, mu|nition, powder, &s;hot &amp;c. for the furthering of this great and heauy enterprize of relieving the City Magdenburgh, or at lea&s;twi&s;e, affoording him a free pa&s;&s;age and thorough-fare over the Da&s;&s;aw-bridge, by which meanes his Maje&s;ty might have received all manner of nece&s;&s;aries from <HI>Mey&s;&s;en,</HI> and more con|veniently have pa&s;&s;ed along the River neere unto the City in|tended. Therefore his Maj. did to this end &s;end &s;everall me&s;|&s;engers, with divers moving and extreame patheticall letters. The chiefe&s;t whereof were ba&s;ely kept backe aboue 14. dayes.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, when now the time of delivery was approaching and nece&s;&s;ity required no longer delay; and therefore his Maje&s;ty had brought up his Army to undertake the maine bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and now or never to effect &s;ome notable thing for the common good. The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> fru&s;trated his expectation, and flatly denyed him all his former reque&s;ts, appealing to his du|ty and devotion which they vowed, and the obligation where|with they were obliged to his Imperiall Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>As concerning the Marquis of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> his Excellence (notwith&s;tanding his Maie&s;ty might have depended upon his a&s;&s;i&s;tance) did not deliver or at lea&s;twi&s;e could not deliver, un|to his Maie&s;ty, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries of victuals and &s;hipping in &s;uch time and mea&s;ure as was expected and requi&s;ite.
