<HEAD>To the Gentlemen Readers, <HI>Barnabie Riche</HI> Soldi|our <HI>&s;endeth greeting.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_GEntlemen, vnder rhe&s;e Cloudes of fained Hi&s;tories (if it plea&s;e you to prie with adui&s;ed in&s;ight) you maie find the Anotomy of wanto~ youth, &s;ea&s;oned with ouer late repe~tance: And among&s;t you that bee &s;taied, good le&s;&s;ons to confirme your ex|perience. For other that are now en|tering the world, maie finde whole|&s;ome coun&s;aile to preuent inconuenience.</P>
<P><HI>Simonides</HI> hath now imitated <HI>Sophocles</HI> the <HI>Tragedian,</HI> who accu&s;ed before the Magi&s;trates of dotage, repeated before the~ his <HI>Tragedie</HI> of <HI>Oedipus Coloneus</HI> (whiche at that in&s;taunt he had made) &s;o that his accu&s;ers confounded in their owne o|uerweanyng, departed with a &s;hamefull repul&s;e: So our Spanyard amo~g&s;t our curious Precizians condemned of la&s;ci|uiou&s;ne&s;&s;e, now concludeth their opinions to bee corrupt, whiche accu&s;e hym by onely reportyng this his true intent, whiche vrged hym to publi&s;he his owne follies.</P>
<P>It was fir&s;t his will to warne the vn&s;taied by his fall, and to in&s;truct the incon&s;taunt, to gather vp the fruites of experience, &s;o as the after repentaunce might not make them loath&s;ome. He was coun&s;ailed by the adui&s;e of aged <HI>Aristo,</HI> yet refu&s;ed it. He was admoni&s;hed by the fall of <HI>Porcia,</HI> yet he continued vncon&s;taunt. What women were, <HI>Lamia</HI> taught hym. What Loue was, <HI>Titerus</HI> made triall: and neither the per&s;wa&s;ion of a gallant Soldiour, nor the adui&s;e of an auncient Father, neither
<PB REF="4"> yet the &s;harpe inuectiues of his trauailyng companion <HI>An|thonio,</HI> were euer able to withhold hym, but he would needes pro&s;ecute his follie to the ende.</P>
<P>The&s;e medicines opertunitie offered hym in his fir&s;t tra|uaile, now what &s;ucceedeth in this volume, let the adui&s;ed Reader be Iudge. The ende is <HI>Simonides</HI> found women incon|&s;taunt, the worlde vn&s;table, plea&s;ure &s;till vadyng, hope vncer|taine, expence remedile&s;&s;e, lo&s;t tyme vnrecouerable, and with a teare concluded thus. Good Gentlemen, let my <HI>Cantharus</HI> layd in <HI>Balme,</HI> that is, my youthly follies &s;ea&s;oned with repen|taunce call you home. And &s;ince at <HI>Ciuill</HI> Ladies haue beene &s;tained, I be&s;eeche you remember this, that as the Climate can not alter the effect, &s;o this mi&s;cheef maie as well raigne in <HI>En|gland</HI> as in <HI>Spayne,</HI> and therefore my coun&s;aile is, that you ra|ther content your &s;elues with <HI>Clarindas</HI> fir&s;t repul&s;e, then in the end to become partaker of <HI>Simonides</HI> too late repentance.</P>
<P>But now Gentlemen, for that I knowe very well, that my li|nes &s;hall a&s;&s;one finde a <HI>Scipio Na&s;cica</HI> to reprehende, as a <HI>&V;i|tellius</HI> to commende, a di&s;dainefull iudgement to mi&s;like, as a fauourable opinion to alowe, I haue concluded with my &s;elf to laugh at <HI>Naeuius</HI> when he findes fault, and to ie&s;t at <HI>Boldu|nus</HI> when he cauelleth: &s;o turnyng the furie of their reportes on my per&s;on, I doubt not but to finde &s;houlders to beare the burthen of reproof. For you curteous Gentlemen, I doubt not but you will wincke at that you would not &s;ee, and laugh at that you be&s;t alowe of.

And according to the &s;ub|iect that &s;erued his contemplation, he began with him &s;elf to compare <HI>Rome</HI> that is, to that whiche was: tho&s;e Monuments that are, to tho&s;e whiche were: tho&s;e men that be, with their progeniturs which haue bin, to the end he might gather a con|clu&s;ion of the worlde, by the compari&s;on of bothe ages: whiche ob&s;eruation a&s;&s;uredly (in the iudgement of the wi&s;e&s;t) is the mo&s;t confirmer of a confu&s;ed opinion, not yet per&s;waded with probable authoritie: And to the better accompli&s;hyng of his purpo&s;e, he conuaied him &s;elf to his lodgyng, wherevnto accu|&s;tomarily, many and &s;undrie Gentlemen did re&s;orte: partly to take their repa&s;t, partly to meete good companie, whiche ma|keth the Bankett more accompted of, although the Caates be not &s;o co&s;tly: And finding it Noone tide, and the company redy to &s;it doune to their dinners, he incited by hunger (which is the companion of Trauailers) and de&s;ire of &s;ati&s;faction of that he mu&s;ed vpon, &s;at doune by good fortune in the company of a re|ligious

<PB REF="5"> he can not continue: if of the efect, what worketh he but a tran&s;itorie peace, where Deuinitie maketh bothe peace with God and man.</P>
<P>Naie, the greate&s;t dignitie that maie be gathered by Deui|nitie is this, that the ground worke is infallible, &s;till perma|nent and irreuocable: where among&s;t our Lawyers, this <HI>Can|non</HI> may be anichilated by this learned Doctor, this di&s;tinction fru&s;trated by that Expo&s;iter, yea, and what not turned top&s;ie turuie to &s;erue the &s;ea&s;on for the <HI>Ciuilians</HI> commoditie.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t di&s;po&s;er of Ciuill policie was your <HI>Iustinian,</HI> the fir&s;t informer of hym was God, he concluded <HI>equum &amp; bonum,</HI> the highe&s;t taught hym <HI>equum &amp; bonum: Numa Pompilius</HI> &amp; man not priuie to the true knowledge of God, yet cheefe&s;t of all, referred his endeuours to the &s;eruice of the Gods, acomp|ting that &s;tate vnhappy, where the Gods haue not receiued due reuerence: all States haue reuerenced the profe&s;&s;ion I am of, eche one hath honoured the dignitie I am called vnto, yea euen among&s;t the enemies of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the power of the highe&s;t hath broken out by the mouth of the Chri&s;tian: whereas law is but leueled by derection, admini&s;tred by appointment, yea, and re|ferred all to reformation, the confirmation whereof, neede to be &s;ought for in no other place, then in your owne <HI>Cannons</HI> and Decreetalles, in which you &s;hould finde &s;uche corrections, &s;uch fru&s;trations, &s;uche anticipations and cautelles, as the &s;tudient had euery daie neede of a new memorie, to con&s;ider of his new coated clau&s;e. If wee rea&s;on of antiquitie, and meane thereby to make a &s;uperioritie, no &s;oner was the worlde made but De|uinitie was knowne, yea, the worde was before worlde: for it was God, and where Religion was mo&s;t honoured, there was peace mo&s;t plentifull.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Justinians radices</HI> were not knowne, but the lawe of the Tables were taught, then the lawe was not in the Ciuill Magi&s;trate to di&s;po&s;e, but the Prie&s;t had it to propounde, that lawe was deliuered by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and confirmed by the pre|&s;ence of the Lawgiuer, and while that lawe was continued, <HI>I&s;|raell</HI> was partaker of the promi&s;e, and benefited by the plentie, the Heathen fell before them, for the Lorde of ho&s;tes was a|mong&s;t
<PB REF="6"> them. In fallyng from the lawe, thei were deliuered into the handes of their enemies, where in continuyng in the lawe, thei were the Lordes of all Nations: &s;o that wee ought to note this, Deuinitie is a heauenly lawe, confirmed by anti|quitie, &s;ealed by God the Lawgiuer, Cleargie men &s;anctified and appointed, who not onely in&s;truct our Ciuilians touching their &s;oules, but al&s;o how to di&s;po&s;e their Ciuill conclu&s;ions. Our habit is aun&s;werable to our profe&s;&s;ion, our life corre&s;pon|dent to them bothe: where Lawyers are &s;umpteous in appa|rell, though his profe&s;&s;ion is vertuous, and concluded in Me|diocritie: yet his life &s;o farre from his learnyng, that they bee <HI>pugnantia inter &s;e,</HI> thei condemne Couetou&s;ne&s;&s;e, yet them&s;el|ues are neuer &s;ati&s;fied: Thei excomunicat the Ince&s;tious, yet who more di&s;&s;olute then they: They make their Plea accor|dyng to the peney, and not to the truthe: They coyne delaies for priuate aduauntage: they make &s;traight crooked, and croo|ked &s;traight: Men thei are fed with vainglorie, led by fond opi|nion, coun&s;ailed by vncertaine <HI>Cannons,</HI> reuerenced rather for their authoritie then vertue: yea, <HI>Roome</HI> were happie if either thei were not or were better, by the one &s;he &s;hould be rid of con|tention, by the other benefited in their amendme~t. Good Lord, how many <HI>Athenian</HI> Oratours haue wee that counterfaite <HI>Squinancy</HI> for a little coyne, yet are to open mouthed again&s;t the poore mans Proce&s;&s;e, &s;uche delaies from Court to Court, &s;uche dilatorie Pleas, &s;uche Iudgement with Proui&s;o, that the poore &s;uiter findes his pur&s;e &s;oner emptied, then his cau&s;e en|ded, thei affectat eloquence to maintaine bad cau&s;es, thei are &s;tudiou&s;ly affable to procure new Clientes, thei are deuilli&s;hly &s;ubtill to cloke inconueniences, &s;o that though the preceptes thei &s;tudie be neuer &s;o perfect, yet the profe&s;&s;ors are &s;till &s;o vn|towarde, that &s;eemyng to be the mini&s;ters of light, they hunt after continuall darkne&s;&s;e, concluding the truthe within a gol|den Cloude, makyng blacke white, and white blacke, darke|nyng al thinges with their di&s;tinctions that &s;hould giue light: &s;o that though in all thynges thei &s;eeme ciuill, yet in all thyn|ges thei are mo&s;t inciuill.</P>
<P>But it maie bee <HI>(Signior Sandalio)</HI> you imagine the&s;e wor|des
<PB REF="6"> to bee &s;poken of &s;pite, and that they are concluded by no proofe: certainely if you doe &s;o you are deceiued, for what &s;oe|uer is here &s;poken by me, I will not onely confirme it by writ|ten authoritie, but al&s;o conclude it by your owne profe&s;&s;ion: naie, I will finde out that your expo&s;iters of Lawe wrote ma|ny thynges <HI>pugnantia inter &s;e,</HI> and agreeyng no waies: one thyng confirmed this daie, and fru&s;trated the next daie, yea, if I &s;hould gather vp all inconueniences in heape, I &s;hould not be &s;ati&s;fied with a &s;edull, but write a whole volume: whiche if no otherwi&s;e, yet euen by <HI>Protulus</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Nerua,</HI> maie bee confirmed, who by his iniurious cauilations, was the de|&s;troyer of <HI>Othos</HI> cau&s;e, a man &s;ingulerly familier with hym, and whom by his owne profe&s;&s;ion to <HI>Vitellius</HI> he wickedly be|trayed: For contrarieties, who doeth not accu&s;e <HI>Baldus Pe|ru&s;inus,</HI> who although for his exceedyng learnyng he was ho|noured among&s;t the famous Writers of our time, yet among&s;t the learnede&s;t is accu&s;ed for incon&s;tancie in his writyng and contrarious opinions, in that wherein he &s;hould haue bin mo&s;t firme.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> he to &s;hew the varietie of his wit did innouate: &s;o that to conclude, the mo&s;t parte of you bind your &s;elues prente&s;e to varyetie, not bent to any &s;tabilitie, but accor|dyng to the vanitie of the tyme, doe you fa&s;ten all your conclu|&s;ion.

<P><HI>Saturius,</HI> an other of your &s;ecte, hath this prai&s;e waityng of him, that he was neuer the reporter or admitter of any profita|ble &s;entence in law.</P>
<P>For couetou&s;ne&s;&s;e, who more commonly noted the~ <HI>Demo&s;ti|nes</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Athenians?</HI> or <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Romai|nes?</HI> whom <HI>Tullie</HI> verie pretilie nippeth of his nerene&s;&s;e, by o|penyng in couert how he had receiued a &s;iluer <HI>Spinx</HI> of <HI>&V;erris</HI> for pleadyng his cau&s;e: &s;o <HI>Angelius Rais</HI> among the <HI>Neopoli|tans,</HI> who for that his Client denied him chaunge of a peece of ba&s;e monie, concluded with his Aduer&s;arie, non &s;uted the cau&s;e neither afterward &s;upplied the place of an aduocate.</P>
<PB REF="7">
<P>Now <HI>Signior Sandalio,</HI> you may &s;&eacute;e that I am led by exam|ple, not fed by opinion, I take not hold fa&s;t of any report: but am confirmed by myne owne knowledge, for re&s;ortyng to our common place of Iu&s;tice, I heare many execrations powred out: &s;ome openly exclaime again&s;t iniurious delaies, fewe or none liue by gettyng, al &s;pend, &s;o that Lawyers are only made riche, the poore Client mi&s;erablie poore.</P>
<P>But you maie well &s;aie that this toucheth nothyng the pro|fe&s;&s;ion it &s;elf, and admit I thinke &s;o, notwith&s;tandyng this I mu&s;te and maie conclude touching the controuer&s;ie that wee haue now in hand, that where as the ground works of law, are at the di&s;po&s;ition and inuention of man, thei are by farre oddes more ba&s;e then our preceptes which are written and &s;et downe with the finger of God, deliuered by tho&s;e that were en&s;pired by God, yea, and &s;o thei take efecte, as not onely thei are the ground worke of all other profe&s;&s;ions, but al&s;o the mainteiners of all both Deuine and Ciuill policies.</P>
<P>But you may (perhappes) thinke to touche me nere, admit|tyng what I &s;peake of Deuinitie it &s;elf, but reprehendyng the profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame, yet herein if you bethinke your &s;elfe, of the &s;ure&s;t holdfa&s;t, you &s;hall bee the farthe&s;t of from your pur|po&s;e. Then the religious who more deuoute? as <HI>Apolonius</HI> the Abbot, who an hundred tymes daie and night with great con|trition and compunction of &s;pirite called vpon the highe&s;t, in his often prayer who wondreth not at his diligence, in his ben|dyng of his knees, who prai&s;eth not his humilitie. <HI>Pastuuius</HI> an other of our profe&s;&s;ion, was &s;o intentiuely bent to prayer (as <HI>Sabellicus</HI> reporteth) that in health he was neuer found vn|occupied, in &s;ickne&s;&s;e when weakene&s;&s;e con&s;trained hym to keepe his bed &s;at &s;till deuoute, hauyng the v&s;e of his tongue taken from hym, yet continued religious, yea, no &s;oner cea&s;ed he meditation then his &s;oule was &s;eparated from his bodie.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;ace Sirus</HI> in the Citie of <HI>Spoletum,</HI> praied continually three daies and three nightes vpo~ his knees without cea&s;yng, which &s;ome of the Citie admittyng for an hypocriticall attempt &s;troke hym, reuilyng him with vngracious and bad language: whiche notwith&s;tandyng, &s;uche was the zeale that accompa|nied

<P>Many other could I repeate vnto you: who not onely for their a&s;&s;idious prayer, but al&s;o for their integritie of life, the worlde hath had and doeth holde, in wonderfull admiration. But <HI>Signior Pierro de ferago&s;a,</HI> thinke you in the&s;e actions to &s;cape &s;cotfree, a&s;&s;uredly &s;ir that maie not bee, for well I wote you are as &s;tudiou&s;ly bent to take holde of the poore Deuine, as any, yea, and as erreligious as the be&s;t: for your profe&s;&s;ion the more I looke into it, the more I looth it, preferryng with <HI>Tully</HI> the iniu&s;ti&s;t Peace before the iu&s;ti&s;t Warre: accompting Soldiours the mo&s;t vnnece&s;&s;arie members that maie bee in a State: For that by experience, their practi&s;e, their honour, nay all actions what&s;oeuer thei attempt, are begun, continued, and ended in bloud.</P>
<P>The&s;e Soldiours the be&s;t &s;orte of them, what be thei, per|happes noble in birthe, yet la&s;ciuious in behauiour, con&s;taunt in nothyng but in crueltie, wi&s;e in fewe thynges but in Stra|tagemes, in reuengyng to cruell, in vncha&s;t loue to di&s;&s;olute, the Captaine in feare of the Soldiour, the Soldiour cozoned by the Captaine, and bothe of them commonly the con&s;umers of the Citizens. Let Warre once take holde of a plentious lande, the Citizen is made &s;ubiect in his owne hou&s;e, his wife deflowred, his daughters defamed, his riches not his owne, yet all this while the Soldiour will bee coumpted commodious: And were thei to bee admitted in a State, the Countrey Hu&s;|bandman is forced by feare to for&s;ake his labour, and what he trauaileth for in &s;orowe, the Soldiour con&s;umeth in riot. But neither the beginning of Warre, neither the effect, neither the action, nor the agent are vertuous, and therefore not commen|dable. The beginnyng of Di&s;&s;ention was de&s;ire and coue|tou&s;ne&s;&s;e of others Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The effect of Warre, is the de&s;truction of Countries, the de&s;olation of noble Hou&s;es, and
<PB REF="8"> the &s;ackyng of opulent Cities: the action dependeth vpon for|tune or mi&s;fortune: vppon oportunities, delaies, forwardne&s;&s;e and vntowardne&s;&s;e of a number of vaine headed followers, who&s;e behauiour and life, beeyng neuer leueled nor ordered by derection, how maie it bee thought that any of their actions &s;hould be either prai&s;e worthie or vertuous. They are the hyre|lynges of ambicious Princes, whom though the &s;ubiect alow of for feare, yet would thei gain&s;aie them if thei dur&s;t.</P>
<P>Naturally the Soldiour is borne Martiali&s;t, bloudy myn|ded, &s;ubiect to rage and anger vpon &s;leight or no cau&s;e, whiche hath followyng her alwaies reuenge: Now, if the Soldiour growe into furie on &s;o light occa&s;ion, thinke you the reuenge to be ordered by di&s;cretion. What Prince can e&s;cape the Sol|diours furie? nay, are not thei naturally mutinous in them&s;el|ues? How iniuriou&s;ly left the <HI>Egiptians</HI> their Kyng <HI>P&s;amme|tricus</HI> in his Warre again&s;t the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> when as two thou|&s;ande of them at one in&s;taunt reuolted to the Enemie, neither hauyng re&s;pect to the honour of their Prince, nor the &s;auegard of their Countrey.</P>
<P>Nay when the <HI>Romaine</HI> Hor&s;emen were &s;ent out to incou~ter the power of their enemies, when at plea&s;ure thei might haue de&s;troyed them, yet remembryng the delaie, their con&s;ull <HI>Fa|bius</HI> made in pa&s;&s;ing the law <HI>Agraria,</HI> thei pretermited to their great &s;hame, the offered opertunitie.</P>
<P>The like mi&s;cheefes by their meanes fell on <HI>Apius Clau|dias,</HI> who for that thei would di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e him of his Triumph, they admitted rather of a di&s;honourable flight.</P>
<P>I would note al&s;o the defect of the Frenchmen, vnder the gouernment of <HI>Quintilius Varus,</HI> the horrible murther com|mitted on <HI>Anthony Ba&s;&s;ianus Carracalla</HI> Emproure by his &s;worne Soldiour <HI>Martialis,</HI> and the de&s;truction of <HI>Adoaldus</HI> Kyng of <HI>Gothes,</HI> by one of his owne retinew called <HI>Zilla Ge|pida.</HI> Truly truly, the memorie of the notable di&s;a&s;ters, vngra|cious and bloudie Murthers, Ince&s;tious and vngodly Rapes committed by the Soldiours, inforceth me almo&s;t into a hor|rour to call them to remembraunce.</P>

<P>_AMid&s;t the de&s;ert of <HI>Scithia,</HI> a renouned Ab|bot called <HI>Moy&s;es</HI> was re&s;ident, who being de&s;ired to giue his cen&s;ure vppon a Frier of the brotherhood that had offended, he came in pre&s;ence with a great &s;ack of &s;and at his backe, and beyng demanded what he brought with him, he made aun&s;wer thei were his &s;innes, whche &s;carcely he was able to beare thei were &s;o burden&s;ome, muche le&s;&s;e to correcte an others. Saincte <HI>Fraunces</HI> trauilyng in companie with one of his fraternitie, and thei meetyng with a poore man, the Frier his companion &s;aied vnto him: Father, although this man be poore touchyng the riches of the worlde, it maie be yet, in de&s;ire to enioy much,
<PB REF="9"> he is riche: which &s;peeches beyng well waied of this Godly fa|ther, he forced this coniecturyng Deuine to di&s;robe him &s;elf and to couer the poore man, thinkyng hym worthie to make recompence by a benefite, who with leude language had iniu|riou&s;lie &s;laundered the poore man.</P>
<P>The actions of the&s;e holy men wel con&s;idered, be &s;ufficient to condemne your pre&s;umtion Father <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> I feare me you haue more cau&s;e to cary the &s;acke then had <HI>Moy&s;es,</HI> and to be di&s;robed then the other Frier, who not onely haue taken vpon you to &s;launder others but al&s;o to dyfie your &s;elf, feedyng your owne fancie with the copiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of your &s;weete &s;et wor|des, and imagine that your colours bee of continuance e|nough to &s;hadow your iniurous counterfaite, but by that time you haue heard but a little what you haue mi&s;taken, and con|&s;ider of that I can reporte, you &s;hal find how greatly your own &s;elf haue neede of reformatio~, and how vainly you vaunt before the victorie. Your &s;tr&s;t argumentes you brought touchyng the dignitie of your profe&s;&s;ion, as I remember was this, that it was Deuine, in&s;crutable, &s;till parmenent, pre&s;cribed by God, immitated by you of the Clergie, opened to vs of the Laietie, and all this I admit, nay I honour, I acknowledge what &s;o is religious is Honourable, and if better title might bee I would mini&s;ter it. Yet thus farre (mai&s;ter Docter) I mu&s;t wade, that our Lawes although thei were the di&s;po&s;itions of mortall me~, yet are thei the in&s;piration of the highe&s;t, and what &s;o is &s;ette doune by the finger of God for offen&s;iue and not to be folowed, is neither admitted of the Lawyer, nor let &s;lip without correc|tion. Where the Lorde was not knowne, lawe mini&s;tred equite, and where God is knowne, the conte~pt of &s;ome is &s;uch, that if no corporall puni&s;hment did terrifie, the bare commaun|dement of the lawe mini&s;tred by the hande of <HI>Moy&s;es,</HI> would little or nothyng preuaile: And truely touchyng lawe in it &s;elf I find thus much, that hauyng pa&s;t through &s;o many inter|pretours handlyng, it can not be but the method &s;hould be ex|qui&s;it, and lookt into by &s;o many Religions, it can not be di&s;|ordered: And certainly beyng (as it were) leueled and propor|tioned according to the true meaning of the Scriptures it can

<P>I &s;ee not moreouer how you are to touch the per&s;on of the Lawyer, more then your &s;elf, either with contrarious opini|ons, or vnnece&s;&s;arie po&s;itions, or iniurious delaies, or auari|cious de&s;ires. In general, the men be very &s;tudious (for the art requires no le&s;&s;e) and where the mind is ocupied with wi&s;e preceptes, the actions of the life can hardly be vncon&s;tant, if at any tyme contrarieties pa&s;&s;e, vnle&s;&s;e in a particuler mans opinion, this toucheth not the Lawe it &s;elf with any varietie, but the mi&s;deamyng man: yea, you knowe well in arte, this matter is vndoubtedly true, y^t by contraries the truth is &s;one&s;t founde out, and without controuertyng (in myne opinion) the groundworkes of all artes &s;hould bee lefte but nakedly bare, but for the &s;cience in it &s;elf, it is &s;till the &s;ame neuer alte|ryng. What the Cannon Lawe is and of what authoritie, you can as well as I beare witne&s;&s;e, whiche hath his original from the mouthe of our holy Father the <HI>Pope,</HI> and from the coun&s;ailes, from the decrees of the auncient Fathers, and po|&s;itions

<P>Yet for all this if it might be &s;poken, <HI>non idem &s;emper e&s;t ca|non,</HI> I mu&s;t not &s;aie contrarious, but if libertie were graunted me to touche what I knowe true, Lorde what &s;quaryng could I finde among&s;t your generall Coun&s;ailes, what daliaunce with Scriptures: &s;hould I &s;aie wre&s;tyng of them, no, mum budget, you are of the holy hou&s;e, and therefore farre be it from me to reproue you, when I like not the looke of a faggot: But this I dare &s;aie for the Deuine, as he for the Lawyer hath al|readie auowed, he hath as humble a Habite as the be&s;t, yet as la&s;ciuious is he as the mo&s;te, whiche poinct although you can hardly fa&s;ten vppon the Lawyer, yet the mo&s;t parte of you, can not but in your con&s;cience confe&s;&s;e you culpable: yea, and Ma|&s;ter Deuine is couetous too, and can as well &s;kill of a <HI>Peter peney,</HI> as the Lawyer of his Clientes fee. But it maie bee that what &s;o is vi&s;cious in the Lawyer, &s;hall be vertuous in the De|uine, and &s;o in deede you maie matche me: Yet for examples &s;ake I will open the liues of &s;ome of our <HI>Romi&s;he</HI> Prelattes, whom though you haue preferred worthely for their humilitie, yet &s;ome I maie touche for their approued follies: &s;o that with you I will turne all vppon the Cleargy men, and leaue the Scripture, as it is perfect in it &s;elf, except it be peruerted by his Interpreter.</P>

For what is there to be allowed of in Warlike bloud&s;uckers: not their pollicie, for that it hath relation to an ill end: not their dilligence, for that it re&s;pecteth nought but murther: not their obedience, for that it is for feare: not their Iudgementes, for that thei are &s;euere: not their orders, becau&s;e thei are vncer|taine to commaunde: not their life, becau&s;e it is leude.</P>
<P>Their imagination is reuenge, their mindes bloudie, their di&s;po&s;itions wrathfull, their attempt vncon&s;taunt: yea, and &s;uche thei be as will &s;ell God for golde, and their Countrie for commoditie.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e Father <HI>Sebastian</HI> hath touched this clau&s;e nere enough, I will be the breefer onely addyng this anticipa|tion to <HI>Don Pierros</HI> apologie, that the Soldiour is not &s;o no|bly
<PB REF="12"> acounted of amo~g&s;t Princes as the Lawyer, for that which in our memorie a mo&s;t renounced Emperour <HI>Sigi&s;munde,</HI> of ex|qui&s;ite valewe, yea, and a braue Soldiour confirmed it to one <HI>George Ficellas</HI> a learned Lawyer, on whom he not onely be|&s;towed the order of Knyghthoode, but in all cau&s;es he al&s;o pre|ferred him as a Coun&s;ailer, whiche beyng obicted again&s;t him by &s;ome of his noble Soldiours, he made an&s;were, that it was ea&s;ie for him to make an hundred Soldiours in one daie, but to make a Doctor, required a thou&s;and yeres.</P>
<P>Herein maie our Soldiour perceiue (if he plea&s;e) how light their profe&s;&s;ion is when it is learned in a daie, and how farre to be vnworthie in re&s;pect of the Lawyer, when a Prince of &s;uch memorie concluded of it &s;o &s;lenderly.</P>
<P>I could report vnto you father, the e&s;timation that <HI>Alexan|der</HI> had of the Ciuilian <HI>Vlpianus,</HI> whom in all his &s;ecrete at|temptes and &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, he tooke coun&s;aile of him, and would admit nothing to pa&s;&s;e, whiche were not confirmed by him.</P>
<P>Yea, the Princes of our tyme haue &s;o honoured Lawyers, as that thei by &s;peciall authoritie inioyned them, that if ought did pa&s;&s;e their handes (yea, though vnder priuie &s;ignet) thei &s;hould not alowe, were it repugnant or contrarie to Law.</P>
<P>My conclu&s;ion is therfore noble Iudge, that &s;ince the Law|yer is le&s;&s;e vicious then the Deuine, and of greater dignitie then is the Soldiour, he &s;hould haue place aboue them bothe, whereas the one is exce&s;&s;iuely &s;infull, the other excedingly per|uer&s;e and cruell. The determination whereof I leaue to your correction, and now yeeld &s;ucce&s;&s;iuely the roome to <HI>Don Piero de Ferago&s;a</HI> to &s;peake for him &s;elf.</P>
<P>Our Soldiour hauyng attentiuely bent his eare to either of the inuectiues, and co~cluded with him &s;elf how to aun&s;wer, began to di&s;cour&s;e thus.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Apologie of the</HI> Sol|diour in his owne defence</HEAD>
<PB REF="13">
<P>_ALthough I haue no Schoole Rethoricke (Gentlemen) or fine phra&s;es to make my cau&s;e more commendable, yet as the naked truth leadeth me, &amp; myne owne experience hath taught me, I will make you priuie to my little &s;kill.</P>
<P>In my youth when I was booki&s;he, I remember I red a Pretie Storie of Sainct <HI>Barnade,</HI> who if by chaunce he fortuned to &s;py out a poore man meanly appareled, he would alwaies &s;aie to hym &s;elf thus: truely <HI>Barnade</HI> this man with more pacience beareth his cro&s;&s;e then thou. If one richly apparelled, it maie be that this man vnder his delycate clothing, hath a better &s;oule then thou ha&s;t <HI>(Barnnde)</HI> vnder thy religious habit. In whiche action of his this I bluntly i|magine of (mai&s;ter Deuine) that the Godly Father had his eye neuer parciall, but alwaies condemnyng him &s;elf, and not reprouing others.</P>
<P>This le&s;&s;on if you and the Lawyer had learned, and you e|&s;pecially &s;ir <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> had followed, you would not haue bin &s;o bu&s;ie in bewraiyng other mens errours, but indeuoured to be indu&s;trious, in amendyng your owne imperfections.</P>
<P><HI>Ae&s;opes</HI> Crowe and our Cleargie men are now adaies of one condition, y^e bird cared not how many fethers &s;he borowed to make her &s;elf braue, nor thei how many vices thei correct, &s;o thei cloake their owne, the birde in a&s;piryng to be Kyng had a reprochfull fall, and di&s;robed of her plumes proued but a blacke Crowe, the Cleargie men, in endeuoryng to &s;eeme ho|ly proue vicious, and but &s;euered from the dignitie of their profe&s;&s;ion, are in the ende as blacke in vices as the birde in colours.</P>
<P>Thinke you (good Sir <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI>) that as nature hath made vs Soldiours re&s;onable, &s;o &s;he hathe not alowed vs the fruites of rea&s;on, both to looke into other mens actions and to order our owne, yes &s;ir yes, though the clarke be neuer &s;o &s;ubtil the Soldiour can compa&s;&s;e him, and the Lawyer neuer &s;o craftie &s;implicitie may di&s;couer him: and in that you make Soldiours altogither vicious, it mu&s;t nedes fall out that &s;ome of your &s;in|nes
<PB REF="13"> &amp; theirs are of acquaintau~ce, or els yours are &s;o proud that thei di&s;daine ours. But becau&s;e you mu&s;t not erre, you are with out &s;inne, yet notwith&s;tandyng, giue me leaue to &s;aie &s;ome|what in mine owne cau&s;e. The Soldiour &s;aie (Mai&s;ter De|uine) is an vnnece&s;&s;arie member, the onely maintainer of the a&s;piryng Princes plea&s;ure, the foe of Citezens, the di&s;troier of countrie men, the &s;acker of Cities, the deflourer of Maidens, a light headed reuenger, a harebrained atte~pter, a bloudie per|former, con&s;tant in nothing but in crueltie, yea, to conclude worthie of nothyng but not to bee.</P>
<P>Now I by my experience can &s;hew, and by your profe&s;&s;ion will per&s;wade either of you, that a Soldiour in liuing is more continent then you both, and for a Commonwealth as profita|ble as the be&s;t. Warre is a mini&s;ter of Gods Iu&s;tice, for either contempt of Religion, or wicked life in ciuill Mage&s;trates, &s;o that it is your &s;innes that drawethe the Soldiours &s;worde: whiche if you liued well &s;hould be &s;heathed perpetually. God is not the author of ill, but the chafticer of abu&s;e, he ordereth the will of Princes to reuenge, and we as obedient &s;ubiectes, are the mini&s;ters to performe. If power were not to maintaine Princes Proceedinges, the Prince &s;hould be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t of his &s;tate, cruell handes would be laide on the Mini&s;trie, yea, the Lawyer pulde from place of Iu&s;tice: &s;o that in peace, the name of a Soldiour re&s;traineth the rebillious, in warre makes &s;ub|iect the proude&s;t re&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Wee referre our actions to the Princes will, the Prince by the direction of God, who &s;ince he is the gouernour of bothe actions, I dare auowe thei are not vicious.</P>
<P>But you maie obiect that in proude attemptes of Princes, the Soldiour is &s;till pre&s;ent, not re&s;pctyng the cau&s;e, but his owne profite. Truely in iniurious cau&s;es I knowe that for certaine, the Soldiour is as contrary to the Warre as the be&s;t, who by proofe (and not by ge&s;&s;e) conclude of the euente of the battaile, when the cau&s;e proceedeth of a wrongfull grounde, not like the eDuine who will continue his errours without controlement, nor like the Lawyer, who of purpo&s;e will take a wrongfull cau&s;e, to cozin his Client of his coyne.</P>
<PB REF="14">
<P>If then warres be lawfull, warriours are not illegitimate: if in generall, the profe&s;&s;ion is to be liked of, then can you but finde fault with perticuler men, and if &s;o you minde to nippe me, neither Mai&s;ter Deuine &s;hall &s;cape &s;cotfree with his &s;mooth lookes, nor Mai&s;ter Lawyer with his glozes: for this I dare auowe, that if eche of our liues be lookt into, the Sol|diour is as &s;urely tied to all vertuous actions as any one pro|fe&s;&s;ion what &s;o euer. In the choyce of a Soldiour, we doe not onely regarde the abilitie of his bodie, but the qualitie of the mynd, for if Religion, circum&s;pection, preuention, coun&s;aill, experience by longe practi&s;e, zeale, faithfull performaunce of promi&s;e, re&s;olutne&s;&s;e in attemptes, continencie in life, care|fulne&s;&s;e to &s;ati&s;fie be not in him that would enter the profe&s;&s;i|on, truely the charge will be ill lookte into, neither is &s;uche a one to be admitted in choyce, then if a Soldiour of iudgement be had, when he is imployde, howe liues he in the feelde, in the feare of God, not a&s;&s;ured of his life from one hower to an o|ther, ab&s;tinent in diet, hard lodgyng, diligent to plea&s;e, care|full to correct, both handes, thoughtes, and all are occupied: &s;o that neither lei&s;ure &s;erues him to be idely occupied, nor the &s;eueritie of the Captaine admits him to runne a&s;traie. Well then, &s;ince it &s;o fallethe out that &s;uch thei &s;hould bee, and thus thei are imployed, you mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e that &s;ome there are or els the name and title &s;hould bee hardly be&s;tead: For the bad, it maie be thei borrow &s;ome of their errours from you, you are &s;o priuie to their e&s;capes.</P>
<P>But me thinkes your iudgement in di&s;po&s;ition of Nature, whereas you make the whole &s;orte of Soldiours ra&s;he, rebel|lious, bloudie mynded, and murtherous is but very bad: truely if thei &s;hould bee ra&s;he, it is nothyng but in venturyng their li|ues for you that hate them: for if thei were not gouerned, their &s;ucce&s;&s;e &s;hould bee more infortunate then it is. If rebellious, truely <HI>Alexander</HI> the great had not conquered &s;o many Coun|treis, &s;ubdued &s;o many Kyngdomes, and ouercome &s;o many Nations, and as it were but with a handfull of his <HI>Macedo|nians</HI> and <HI>Gretians.</HI> If bloudy mynded, why then &s;pared <HI>Cea&s;ar</HI> tho&s;e Senators and Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> whom bothe by their
<PB REF="14"> owne hand writynges and often attemptes, he well knewe to be the followers of <HI>Pompei</HI> and his capitall enemies. If mur|therous, how often might the <HI>Venetian</HI> Armies haue worthely &s;poyled the whole Ilande of <HI>Creat,</HI> whiche not onely had mur|thered many of their Families with the &s;worde, but al&s;o rebel|led again&s;t them more then fiue tymes. If Incontinent, what cau&s;ed <HI>Scipio</HI> to redeliuer that noble yong Virgine, who for her pa&s;&s;yng beautie and greate admiration of per&s;on, was pre&s;en|ted vnto him as a rare gift, <HI>Scipio</HI> hym&s;elf amazed at the &s;ight, would yet deliuer her to <HI>Luceius,</HI> to whom &s;he was e&s;pou&s;ed, and gaue hym al&s;o for a Dowrie the golde that her Parentes had brought to redeeme her. If couetous, how fell it out that after <HI>L. Mummius</HI> had taken <HI>Corinthe,</HI> and adorned all <HI>Italy</HI> with the riches of that Spoyle, keepyng &s;o little to his owne v&s;e, that the Senate was faine for very neede, to giue Dowrie to his Daughter of the common Trea&s;ure. There is no rea|&s;on that either you can obiect again&s;t vs of your owne know|ledge, or alledge by your readyng, but I haue &s;alued it vp, ei|ther by rea&s;onable demon&s;tration, or &s;ufficient in&s;taunce. And to &s;peake my con&s;cience, I know not the be&s;t of you, if Warre &s;hould waite on you, that would not crouche to haue a Soldi|ours countenaunce, and bende if he beckoned.</P>
<P>But why is he not liked of with the Religious, becau&s;e he can not finde in his harte to colour an errour: and wherefore is he di&s;commodious to the Lawyer, for that he abridgeth hym of conuenient tyme, to practi&s;e his corruption. Thus the poore Soldiour &s;tandeth in harde tearmes you maie &s;ee (Religious Gentleman) when he &s;hall bee backbited of tho&s;e, who mo&s;te leudly gouerne them &s;elues: and bee condemned by &s;uche as haue greate&s;t neede of amendment.</P>
<P>But what is he (I praie you) that is &s;poyled by the Soldi|our but the Enemie: whom if he &s;hould &s;uffer to pro&s;per in his wealth, the continuaunce of trouble would decaie our owne &s;tate, and we might &s;uffer others to be riche to make our &s;elues poore, mini&s;tryng our enemies fewell, to &s;et our &s;elues on fire, and like innocent babes, bring our Mai&s;ter a rodd to beate our owne tailes.</P>
<PB REF="15">
<P>But this let I willyngly &s;lippe, giuyng the ignoraunt ra|ther leaue to correct what thei knowe not, then openyng tho&s;e experimentes that tyme hath driuen into me by many occa&s;i|ons, I might make them note that whiche if thei knewe, thei would neuer well imploye. But for that I haue learned &s;ome one poinct of Rethoricke of you both, I will now approue it if I can, openyng a little the e&s;capes of bothe your two profe&s;&s;i|ons: &s;o that in findyng many errours in you, I maie the better colour myne owne.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t for you Mai&s;ter Cleargie man, thus muche mu&s;t I craue, that as liberall I maie &s;peake what I thinke, as you what you plea&s;e, &s;o doubt I not, but to proue you as erreli|gious as the be&s;t, and the Lawyer as lawle&s;&s;e as the mo&s;t. In|continencie is the badge of your profe&s;&s;ion, or els <HI>Pope Ione</HI> could not haue a yong Monk in her belly, nor &s;o many Clear|gie men combred with yong Maidens fir&s;t children.</P>
<P>The <HI>Libertines</HI> as you call them, the <HI>Protestantes</HI> I meane (for among&s;t tho&s;e in my tyme I haue beene conuer&s;aunt) al|though thei maie perhappes in pointes of Deuinitie bee farre from you as you thinke, and though the errors wherewith you charge them be aboue my reache, yet truely as touchyng their life, I haue not founde them &s;o leude, and yet hauyng &s;inned are &s;o little corrected.</P>
<P>Nay, this errour is not onely perpetrated by your &s;elues, but al&s;o wincked at in others, where if a man bee neuer &s;o ince|&s;tious, he maie bee a&s;&s;oyled for &s;iluer, and a dubble Ducket (a|mong&s;t you) will relea&s;e more Synnes in a moment, then the wickede&s;t man maie commit in his whole life: &s;o that you who &s;hould re&s;traine, graunt libertie: and for a priuate gaine vndoe many, whiche led by fonde lu&s;tes haue &s;mall regarde of them &s;elues.</P>
<P>If I were as priuie to your Bookes as your &s;elues, and could reporte vnto you the mo&s;t notable mi&s;deedes of other a|ges, as I can make open &s;ome of our tyme, neither would you &s;it to heare my long di&s;cour&s;e, nor my voyce able to &s;erue me to fini&s;he out my tale. But touchyng your liues this I finde, who de&s;pi&s;eth &s;inne mo&s;t, followeth it a little, and though in o|pen
<PB REF="15"> face of the worlde &s;ome of you can not brooke to bee ac|compted couetous, yet if a priuate commoditie lighten in your lappes, you will be as readie to catche as the be&s;t, and with as faire &s;peeches to flatter for commoditie as the mo&s;t. You are lime fingered for Liuynges to catche them ere thei fall: yet if a Lay man bee but a little couetous, he were be&s;t to amende for feare of condemnation: Nay, not onely are you couetous but bloud &s;uckers, not &s;ati&s;fied with the bloud of the father, but workyng reuenge vpon the very harmele&s;&s;e infauntes his chil|dren, as did <HI>Rogerius &V;baldinus,</HI> Bi&s;hoppe of <HI>Pi&s;anum,</HI> toward <HI>&V;golinus,</HI> whom when with his three children he had long time kept in pri&s;on, and fed hym with hope of pre&s;ent libertie, if &s;o he would make the &s;aied Archbi&s;hoppe priuie, to certaine trea|&s;ure whiche he had hidden: whiche when he had confe&s;&s;ed, and the Bi&s;hop hauyng got the money, he not onely broke his pro|mi&s;e, but al&s;o &s;tarued hym and his three children mo&s;t mi&s;era|blie to death: whiche fact, the worlde doeth not onely wonder at, but al&s;o abhorre the wicked practi&s;es of &s;uche villanie.</P>
<P>Some of you are <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> falling from the faith, as <HI>Theo|philus</HI> a Prie&s;t in <HI>Cilicia</HI> in my memorie, who for that he was wrongfully depriued of his Archdeaconrie, bounde hym&s;elf to the Deuill, that if he would re&s;tore him to his former dignitie, he would become his body and &s;oule: afterward beyng againe in his pre&s;ent place of honour, he began vehemently to be per|plexed in mynd, with the combraunce of his owne con&s;cience, and with teares &s;eekyng the fauour of the Almightie, he was mercifully &s;aued and deliuered. The&s;e and &s;uche like &s;orte of men are you, and yet men mu&s;t bee tongue tied in reprouyng you, and you liberall in &s;peakyng what you plea&s;e: but as plai|ne&s;&s;e is my profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o plainely haue I opened my mynde, meanyng a little to quite the &s;peeches of <HI>Signior Sandalio:</HI> he is a Lawyer, and I would bee lothe to dye in his debt, becau&s;e myne heires might not be troubled after my decea&s;e. Of hym &s;elf I accompt thus, he may be good, but for the greate&s;t num|ber of his profe&s;&s;ion, thei are &s;tarke naught in that thei are co|uetous: for if corruption were not in the lawe, his profe&s;&s;ion were not gainefull: For if &s;o bee the lawe be certaine in it &s;elf,
<PB REF="16"> why &s;hould Iudgement bee delaied: If bent to doe right, why are &s;o many poore men wronged: If grounded on con&s;cience, why is it parciall. But if the v&s;e of the thyng bee onely ill im|ployed, the faulte is in the Lawyer: Then thus it falleth out, that he who knoweth the will of his Mai&s;ter and doeth it not, &s;hould be beaten with many &s;tripes, how like you this Cannon Mai&s;ter Doctor?</P>
<P>I remember as I trauailed to <HI>Athens,</HI> and being de&s;irous to &s;ee the Monumentes there, it was my happe by a good com|panion of myne (that &s;melt &s;omethyng out of your dealinges) to bryng me to the Aulter of <HI>Minerua,</HI> by whiche oftentymes Pleaes were maintained on bothe parties: in which place, we founde two &s;iluer Celles, hauyng on eche of them, their &s;eue|rall in&s;criptions: on the one was written, <HI>The Pulpit of re|proach,</HI> on the other, <HI>The Cell of Impudencie.</HI> A &s;traunge thyng it is to &s;ee, that &s;o many ages pa&s;t &s;ince the &s;ettyng vp of the&s;e, yet the vyces are not cea&s;ed, &s;ince in all what&s;oeuer you rea&s;on of, either you are reprochfull or impudent: reprochfull, in accu|&s;ing onely on reporte: Impudent, in maintainyng naught but heare&s;aies. For vs Soldiours, admit our &s;wordes fa&s;ten on the Enemie, yet venture wee our liues for the &s;auegarde of our freendes: you neither haue re&s;pect of freend nor familiare, but &s;o you maie profite your &s;elues, you &s;pare not to eate your Clientes out of hou&s;e and home.</P>
<P>But where as you would per&s;wade me by the fauour that the Emprour <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> &s;hewed to a Lawyer, if by that it were to bee concluded, that the Lawyer is more excellent, if fauour bee that you take holdfa&s;t on, neither you can bee admitted be|fore a Soldiour, nor the Deuine take place before a Warri|our: For you, one Emperour &s;erues your turne, but looke but from the fir&s;t foundation of this famous Citie, and you &s;hall finde that the Soldiour was he that defended the State: the Soldiour was he that made <HI>Rome</HI> notable: yea, the Soldiour was onely he that had the creation of the Emperours. In the lo&s;&s;e of a Soldiour, how mourned <HI>Iulius Cea&s;er,</HI> whom not on|ly he buried with bitter teares beyng dead, but al&s;o aliue bene|fited with great honours.</P>
<PB REF="16">
<P><HI>Pompei</HI> the great, built the Citie of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> to no other end but to harbour Soldiours, yea, our mo&s;t notable gouer|nours of this Empire, accompted of a Soldiour as of his fel|lowe in mi&s;fortunes, and in attemptes: of you, but as his flat|terers, to confirme but what he plea&s;e. Perhappes for main|taynyng of a good Plea, the Lawyer maie get a little popu|ler prai&s;e, but we for &s;ubduyng of an Enemie to <HI>Rome,</HI> had the benefite of a triumphe.</P>
<P>Some of your Oratours for their pre&s;umptions haue been cut of, mo&s;t of our Soldiours for their de&s;ertes, haue had their &s;tatues &s;et vp in the marked place.</P>
<P>When <HI>Haniball</HI> knocked at <HI>Rome</HI> gates, why preuailed you not by eloquence, why confounded you not by Religion: Alas the while, your Cake was dowe, and had not the Soldi|our giuen the enemie the repul&s;e, your actions had been &s;carce &s;aileable. While the Soldiour gouerned, peace was as plen|tifull as now it is: the reuenewes of <HI>Rome</HI> greater then now thei be: the exce&s;&s;e of <HI>Rome</HI> le&s;&s;er then now thei are.</P>
<P>In our tyme of gouernment, <HI>Rome</HI> was renowned for her Iu&s;tice and faithfull lawes: Now, when the &s;worde is in the hande of the Religious and ciuill Mage&s;trate, <HI>Rome</HI> is noted for exceedyng vice.</P>
<P>In the daies of <HI>Traiane,</HI> other Countreis &s;ought their La|wes from <HI>Rome:</HI> In the&s;e latter tymes <HI>Rome</HI> is accompted lawle&s;&s;e of all the worlde.</P>
<P>Now for the Cleargie man, what maie he vaunt of, when he only defendeth Religion but with his tongue, but the Sol|diour in daunger and hazarde of his life. For the Lawyer, you can not bryng him to &s;peake at the Barre but with a great fee, where the poore Soldiour his hyre is but eight pence for the very day &s;eruice he loo&s;eth his life: And whether is he more worthie that if he bee imployed, it is but proulyng with his pen for priuate pence, or he that opo&s;eth hym&s;elf with his Pike for publique profite. So that for the &s;ake, bothe of Deuine and Lawyer, yea, for the maintenaunce of the whole State we venture our liues: and yet for all this let Peace &s;mile on <HI>Rome</HI> a little, and Soldiours be vnnece&s;&s;arie.</P>
<PB REF="17">
<P>And &s;eyng it now coms in que&s;tion, what profe&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t worthie, of &s;ondrie men I haue heard &s;ondrie opinions.</P>
<P>Kyng <HI>Dridanias</HI> was wont to &s;aie to the <HI>Cicilians,</HI> that to the &s;acrificyng Prie&s;tes of the Temple mo&s;t honour was due. <HI>Bryas</HI> Kyng of <HI>Argiues,</HI> gaue mo&s;te honour to the <HI>Philo|&s;ophers</HI> that read in Schooles. <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Romaines,</HI> was of opinion that he was worthie of mo&s;t reputa|tion, to whom had happened the victorie of any famous Bat|taile.

And I praie (Mai&s;ter Deuine) what wantes he in worthine&s;&s;e, who defen|deth Religion with the lo&s;&s;e of his life as the Soldiour, of him who doth but coate it doune in his quiet Studie as the Deuine.

<P>But to conclude, bothe to the Deuine and Lawyer, this I add, that &s;ince thei bee &s;o perfect in life and exqui&s;ite in liuyng, I would I were &s;uche a one as they thinke them&s;elues to bee, and not as they are.</P>

<HEAD>&leaf; <HI>The cen&s;ure of</HI> Simonides <HI>vpon the</HI> Deuine, the Lawyer, and the Soldiour.</HEAD>
<P>_GEntlemen, my ignoraunce in eche of your profe&s;&s;ions, my want of knowledge of the fa&s;hions of this State, the vn&s;table con|te~plations which now gouerne my mynd, were rea&s;ons enough (if you knew them) to mi&s;like of my iudgement: yet &s;ince it plea&s;ed you to picke me out as an Arbite|rer in &s;o ambiguous a cau&s;e, as my little &s;kill will &s;erue me, I will make recapitulation of your Obiections, and make you breefly priuie to my conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Religious Gentleman (in myne opinion) very elo|quently, both by Prophane and Ecele&s;ia&s;ticall examples, hath maintained the dignitie of his profe&s;&s;ion, and condemned ma|ny imperfections bothe of Soldiour and Lawyer.</P>
<P>The learned Ciuilian hath both aun&s;wered the Obiections were laied again&s;t hym, and inuerted them again&s;t his Aduer|&s;arie, bothe of you conclude again&s;t the Soldiour, who though in bare tearmes he maintained a &s;ufficient cau&s;e, yet certainely he hath painted out bothe the Deuines and Lawyers imper|fections in approued colours. Generally I finde this, Coue|tou&s;ne&s;&s;e is bothe in the Cleargie man, Lawyer, and Soldi|our: Exce&s;&s;e in Deuine, Lawyer, and Soldiour: yea, and affec|tation of honour, bothe in Deuine, Lawyer, and Soldiour. I accompt the Deuine the very onely man to bee honoured if he liue well: The Lawyer to be wondred at if he iudge well: And yet the Soldiour not to be inferiour for he defendeth well.</P>
<P>I can not tell what Soldiours bee in <HI>Rome,</HI> neither am I priuie to their abu&s;e: but what thei are in <HI>Genoua</HI> well I wot, where as not onely exce&s;&s;e by a Soldiours meanes was bani|&s;hed, but al&s;o the whole State worthely coun&s;ailed by an ho|norable Captaine. If therefore, I &s;hould re&s;olue with my &s;elf, to giue iudgement on either partie, either the Deuine might correct me in di&s;placyng hym, or the Lawyer condemne me in
<PB REF="18"> preferryng the Soldiour, or the Soldiour mi&s;like me in ad|mitting you both. Whervpon, &s;ith vnperfectly from my youth vp hetherto I haue alwaies iudged of colours, I would if I might &s;o order my &s;elf now (hauyng &s;eene &s;omewhat) that in plea&s;ing you all I might yet preferre the truth. Your vertues in eche profe&s;&s;ion are fewe, your vices too many, but &s;ith your errours are more in number then your good qualities, your good is &s;imple bad in that it conquereth not the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t I attempted Iourney towardes this famous Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> noated and renowned through all the worlde, I thought verelie that neither the Cleargie man &s;hould be con|tencious he was &s;o deuine, nor the Lawyer couetous he was &s;o lookt into, nor the Soldeour di&s;&s;olute, where is or &s;hould be &s;o much di&s;cipline. But nowe when I fall in companie a|mong&s;t Citizens, I finde reported <HI>Rome</HI> for vertues, is now the verie <HI>Rome</HI> that is vicious, for great mu&s;t the errours bee in the &s;tate, where bothe Deuine Lawyer and Soldiour are altogither di&s;&s;olute.</P>
<P>I remember in our Cronicles of <HI>Spayne,</HI> when couetous Pre&s;identes &s;ent from this Citie did gouerne vs, oppre&s;&s;yng vs with exactious, and &s;uckyng the marrowe of our wealthe from the bodie of our Commanweale, we had alwaies redre&s;&s;e here: this place was the nur&s;e of reformed iu&s;tice throughout the whole world, but &s;ithe the members now are &s;o farre gone from them &s;elues, as that thei &s;launder the heade, and the Ci|tizens ingenerall by their perticuler errours note out the en|normities of <HI>Rome.</HI> I &s;ee well old iu&s;tice is bani&s;hed, and tho&s;e that once gaue Lawes to others, ought now to bee re&s;trained and brideled them &s;elues, whervppon brefely thus I conclude, that &s;ince the controuer&s;ie betwixt you is for the &s;uperioritie of the per&s;on, and not the dignitie of the &s;ubiecte, that the Di|uine is vnworthie, &s;quaryng from his profe&s;&s;ion, the Lawyer not alowed of, beyng incon&s;tant in his owne decrees, and the Soldiour le&s;&s;e to be di&s;commended then you bothe.</P>
<P>And that you maie &s;ee I ground not vppon light oppinion, giue but eare a little to my tompari&s;on, and I doubt not but to re&s;olue non although you ment to doubt.</P>
<PB REF="18">
<P>It befortuned that three <HI>Scithian</HI> Brothers after the de|cea&s;e of the King their father, fell in controuer&s;ie for the King|dome, eche of them aleadgyng his owne worthines both in ver|tue, valew, and nobilttie: the cau&s;e beyng doubtfull, the Coun|&s;aile of the State referred it to a Kyng, a neighbour of theirs, that he might decide the controuer&s;ie, he concluded thus, that eche of them armed with Cro&s;bowe and arrowe, &s;hould be &s;et in a conuenient place, and he of the three Bretheren whiche could mo&s;te neare&s;t &s;trike the harte of the dead Kyng, (who&s;e bodie to that purpo&s;e was taken out of the Sepulcher and fa|&s;tened to a Tree) &s;hould &s;ucceede hym in the Empire: Vppon this conclu&s;ion, the elde&s;t Brother takyng leuell, &s;trooke his father in the brea&s;t, yet mi&s;&s;yng the harte: The middlemo&s;t in the throte: But now the tyme &s;eruyng for the yonger Brother to trie his mai&s;terie, he dete&s;tyng to perpetrate &s;o great impie|tie, ca&s;t awaie his Bowe and Arrowe, de&s;pi&s;ing rather the au|thoritie of a Prince, then willyng to commit &s;uche notable and vnnaturall ennormitie: The whiche the barbarous Kyng no|tyng, he not onely preferred hym to the Kyngdome, but al&s;o worthely recompen&s;ed hym with condigne honours.</P>
<P>So fareth it at this pre&s;ent with you three Gentlemen, your father (I meane your Countrey whereof you be children and members, I meane <HI>Rome</HI> that now is) is dead to that it hath been, hauyng buried his manifolde titles of renowne in the errours of his &s;ondrie vngracious Citizens: you his chil|dren &s;triuyng for &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that is, indeuouryng for &s;uperiori|tie in the State, are to heare the awarde of me a barbarous Iudge, the whole fortune of <HI>Rome</HI> hath beene laied for you to leuell at: the elde&s;t (I meane the Deuine) hath pearced the brea&s;t, hauyng falne into many errours, as Couetou&s;ne&s;&s;e, In|continencie, mi&s;con&s;truyng of the Scriptures and what not, di&s;placed one of the Pillers of the State, I meane Militarie profe&s;&s;ion: Your &s;econd brother the Lawyer hath &s;triken bothe necke and brea&s;t, not onely beyng corrupt in hym&s;elf, but al&s;o corruptyng his Science, and with the elde&s;t con&s;ented to the bani&s;hyng of all warlike defence: The yonger brother, though willyng to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, yet loth to wound his fathers cor&s;e, repro|ueth
<PB REF="19"> but the Deuine and Lawyers &s;euerall vices, not altoge|ther bani&s;hyng them from any title in the State, that is not vouch&s;auyng to laie bloudie handes on his father, and therfore a comparatis I conclude, he is at this tyme to haue the prehe|minence in the cau&s;e, vntill the Deuine liue better, and the Lawyer amende his mi&s;demeanour.</P>
<P>Thus Gentlemen, you maie perceiue my conclu&s;ion, if I haue erred in ought, beare with my Imperfections, I meant well, and as I thought &s;o I &s;peake: If my iudgement plea&s;e not you, I am to referre it to a better learned then my &s;elf: and Gentleman Soldiour, you are preferred but with a Proui&s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e three admittyng very well of <HI>Simonides</HI> di&s;cour&s;e, ac|cordyng to their &s;euerall affaires, onely the Soldiour deligh|ted in the varietie of his wit, di&s;cour&s;ed thus.</P>
<P>Gentleman &s;traunger, your plau&s;ible iudgement of late throughly per&s;wades me of your bryngyng vp, and your well ordred behauiour a&s;&s;ureth me of your worthie and noble birth, and makes me the willynger, either in courte&s;ie to doe you plea&s;ure, or if my &s;eruice maie any waies &s;tande you in &s;teade, I am readily willyng to aun&s;were your expectation. Where|fore, if it &s;hall plea&s;e you in ought to imploye me, you &s;hall not be more earne&s;t to require, then I willyng to performe.</P>
<P>Truely &s;ir (aun&s;wered <HI>Simonides</HI>) neither will I let &s;lippe your proffered courte&s;ie, nor be vnthankfull for your courtlike affabilitie: If therefore it &s;hall plea&s;e you to accompanie a &s;traunger, to ouer&s;ee the Monumentes of this Citie, I &s;hall in this courte&s;ie be greatly beholdyng vnto you. In breefe be|yng both agreed, <HI>Don Pierro de farago&s;a,</HI> conueyed hym to the mo&s;t auncient and renowned Monumentes that were to bee &s;een: at the la&s;t attainyng the Market place, thei e&s;pied a great a&s;&s;embly of Doctors, Prelattes, and diuers other Citizens: &s;ome plea&s;auntly di&s;po&s;ed among&s;t them &s;elues: &s;ome others, greeuou&s;ly complainyng vppon &s;ome iniurie, and to the ende thei might knowe the cau&s;e of this turmoyle, the Soldiour de|maunded what might be the cau&s;e: to whom it was aun&s;wered, that if it plea&s;ed hym to looke on <HI>Pa&s;quius</HI> Piller, he &s;hould perceiue the whole matter.

Notwith&s;tandyng, con&s;idering how &s;erious the cau&s;e was I had in hand, and how daungerous it were to repul&s;e either the one or the other, I thought it mo&s;t conuenient to make a &s;taie for a &s;pace, in which tyme, either the fancie of the one might be le&s;&s;ened, or the &s;eri|ous affection of the other extingui&s;hed: But alas the while, as thei that are &s;tung with <HI>Scorpions,</HI> are wont from the harmer to &s;eeke their recure, &s;o the&s;e twoo noble Nouices, hauyng their faithfull affections fixed on y^e gli&s;tering gleames of my youth|full beautie, thought no other meanes might be had to remedy their mi&s;&s;e, but only by the attaineme~t of my e&s;peciall fauour.</P>
<P>Alas that &s;imple feminine beautie, &s;hould &s;o bewitch rea&s;o|nable Nobilitie, or &s;uche mi&s;fortunes &s;hould befall, by behol|dyng my declinyng fauour.</P>
<P>The&s;e yong Gentlemen, de&s;i&s;ted not their attempt: for what the one in per&s;on preferred with humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;on, the other proffered in papers with a faithfull a&s;&s;uraunce of loyaltie. In breefe the coales of fancie were kindled, and &s;uche vnacquain|ted humours at la&s;t began to gouerne myne actions, that the fire whiche faine I would haue raked vp in the embers of di&s;|cretion, brake out with furie to myne owne confu&s;ion: For be|yng altogether affectionate towardes <HI>Saluanio,</HI> who (as ill for|tune &s;erued) was alwaies pre&s;ent with fewell to encrea&s;e my fire, helped by opertunitie, and ouercome by his importunitie, at the la&s;t I yeelded to the a&s;&s;ault, promi&s;ing hym the full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of my hart, if he would &s;o moderate him&s;elf by a twelue monethes &s;pace, as no one token of accordaunce, &s;hould fru|&s;trate my priuate intent: and to the ende that our vndoubted a&s;|&s;uraunce &s;hould neuer bee &s;eperated, I imparted vnto hym a Gemme of approued valewe, a&s;&s;uryng hym that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, belongeth to him and no other, who continued the cu&s;to|die

<P>Madame, the long &s;orrowes I haue conceiued by your de|laies, and the earne&s;t zeale that attendeth on my harte, the true loyaltie wherewith I honour you, and the feruent affectes of Loue whiche altogether inforce my thraldome, binde me to be|&s;eeche your fauour, that either by your graunt of grace I may bee reuiued now almo&s;t dead with di&s;paire: or if your di&s;plea|&s;ure be &s;uche as no fauour will be had, I maie be adiudged, the mo&s;t infortunate Louer that liueth: Good Ladie, tho&s;e your glorious eyes, the&s;e your exqui&s;it lineamentes, that your &s;eem|ly behauiour haue applied &s;uche an impre&s;&s;ion to my harte, as neither Arte can eate out the corro&s;iue by coun&s;aile, nor life continue if you contemne: For how can the Moone glad the dark&s;ome night, if her borrowed light of the Sunne be extin|gui&s;hed, or the harte continue in good e&s;tate, if the vitall po|wers be determined.

Alas, that harte whiche ea&s;i|ly yeeldeth to like, can hardly brooke to neglect, and that Ar|rowe whiche hath wounded myne eye with reflection, will ne|uer be lo&s;ened but by the a&s;&s;pect of beautie: So that in your re|pul&s;e, I am tied to &s;uch extremitie, either to liue a dying crea|ture, beeyng manaced by your cruell contempt, or els dye on myne owne &s;worde, to auoyd the furie of an euerla&s;tyng Pur|gatorie.

<HEAD>&para; <HI>How</HI> Simonides <HI>ariuyng at</HI> Naples, <HI>was</HI> entertained by his Countrey man <HI>Fredericke de Cicuta,</HI> &s;ometymes a gallant Courtier, but now a <HI>Carthu&s;ian</HI> Frier.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_SIMONIDES</HI> beyng thus ariued at <HI>Naples,</HI> a famous Citie and Towne of Garri&s;on, was no &s;oner entered the Port, but he was &s;taied by the court of Guarde, and was pre&s;ented before the Viceroy of the Citie, who finding out by his reports, that he was a trauelling Straunger, cau|&s;ed hym courteou&s;ly to bee conueied to a conuenient lodgyng in the Citie, where he might imploye hym&s;elf as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Simonides</HI> repo&s;ing hym&s;elf for that night, on the morrowe que&s;tionyng with his Ho&s;t what Straungers were habitaunt in the Citie, he reported vnto hym, that among&s;t the <HI>Carthu|&s;ians</HI> (a Secte of Friers in&s;tituted by <HI>Bembo</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI>) there was at that in&s;taunt inue&s;ted a Gentleman of Nobilitie, a <HI>Spanyard</HI> once renowned for his holy life, though heretofore he had bin a Courtier of &s;inguler brauerie within that Citie, and hauyng learned his name, whiche was <HI>Fredericke de Cicuta,</HI> he likewi&s;e &s;ought the meane to finde hym out, and beyng pre|ferred to his &s;peech by the licence of the <HI>Superintendent</HI> or <HI>Pro|uo&s;t,</HI> he &s;aluted hym thus.</P>
<P><HI>Signior,</HI> beeyng ariued a Straunger in this Citie, and vn|der&s;tandyng by reporte of your beyng here, who are (as I am enformed) my Countrey man, I thought it a poinct of wi&s;e|dome, to acquaint my &s;elf with one of myne owne Nation, and a parte of ciuilitie, to vi&s;ite a Gentleman of &s;uch renowne as I vnder&s;tand you to be of, willyng, if you haue any &s;eruice wher|in to commaunde me, if it bee your plea&s;ure at any tyme to im|ploy me, you &s;hall finde me more willing to performe, then you readie to commaunde.</P>
<P>Frier <HI>Fredericke</HI> hauing giuen him the <HI>Ba&s;eles manes</HI> (after

<P>The Court of <HI>Naples</HI> here renowned by the excellencie of this <HI>Signior</HI> that now gouerneth it, hath incited many young men (hauyng the raine in their owne neckes) to re&s;orte hether, where bothe by the &s;erenitie of the ayre, thei maie haue a&s;&s;u|raunce of their health, and by the brauerie of the Court, &s;ati&s;fie their youthly humours.

Idlene&s;&s;e, of able Gentlemen la&s;ciuious Mecocks: Their feates of Armes, are turned to a Sinquipace: Thei had rather tread a tricke of one and twentie follies, then performe an action that might increa&s;e honour.</P>
<P>Suche are the di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e &s;orte of Gentlemen, that if thei erre in ought, thei are &s;oothed in the &s;ame: if thei delight to be prai&s;ed, the Flatterer will preuaile: if to bee reuerenced, thei &s;hall haue capp and curte&s;ie: if for title of credite, thei &s;hall bee wor&s;hipped and rewor&s;hipped: if la&s;ciuious and wanton, thei &s;hall want no priuie Brokers: if riotous, who doubtes but Spendthriftes will haunt them: if daintie in diet, thei mu&s;t haue a Frenche Cooke: if fa&s;hionatiue, the Towne &s;hall bee &s;ought for an inuenting Tayler: So that at the la&s;t &s;ome plea|des pur&s;e emptie, and very many are non &s;uited of al their co&s;t|ly attire: and the Farmer in di&s;chargyng the Marchauntes bookes, hath either his Lea&s;e renued or continued for euer.</P>
<P>It is a &s;traunge thyng to &s;ee, how in Courte our daintie Nobles braue it, de&s;iryng rather to feed their Mi&s;tris eye with delicate a&s;pect, then maintaine the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soldiour with nece&s;&s;arie proui&s;ion: yet in this, I altogether blame not the Gentleman, whereas (perhappes as Court fa&s;hion is) plea&s;ing of humours is mo&s;t profitable: he de&s;iryng to bee a Penifather will venture his &s;take among&s;t the re&s;t, but where one &s;p&eacute;edeth a hundred faile, who ouer runne with arerages, are faine them &s;elues to pull downe their bri&s;tles, and to &s;ettle their &s;ailes lo|wer to auoyde the Perrie of perdition.</P>
<P>Truely now adaies <HI>(Signior Simonides)</HI> the fa&s;hion of <HI>Na|ples</HI> is &s;uche, as fauour preuaileth with many by occa&s;ion, not by de&s;art: by opinion, not by worthine&s;&s;e: And now &s;ince peace makes all plentious, Gentlemen will bee delicate: Ladies a|morous: the Prince perhappes &s;tudious. And though not &s;ee|yng
<PB REF="32"> all ennormities, yet compa&s;&s;ed about with many that bee enormous.</P>
<P>Our Courtiers now adaies, from the practi&s;e of the Launce, haue learned to loue: perhappes in remembraunce of their for|mer endeuours, thei will turnie a cour&s;e or two to plea&s;e their Mi&s;tris: but for olde daylie experience, whiche inureth the bo|die to a&s;&s;aultes, alas, thei are to comber&s;ome, we mu&s;t none of them, but if our Mi&s;tris like of a codpeece Dublet, it &s;hall co&s;t them the &s;ettyng on but it &s;hall bee had: If &s;hort Breeches, all <HI>Padua</HI> &s;hall be &s;earched for them. So that now from the En|gli&s;hman, our Italians haue &s;tolne their portrature, and they mu&s;t now bee pictured naked, with a paire of Sheares in his hande, thei are &s;o combred with newe fa&s;hions and inuentions. In the Court of <HI>Naples,</HI> now <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> for his plaine&s;&s;e &s;hall be thru&s;t out, and <HI>Ari&s;tippus</HI> for his nicene&s;&s;e preferred. <HI>Cri&s;ip|pus</HI> with his &s;weete eloquence &s;hall preuaile, where <HI>Cato</HI> with his &s;owre cen&s;ures &s;hall be mi&s;likt. When <HI>Damocles</HI> flattereth fa&s;te&s;t he &s;hal be preferred &s;one&s;t, where if any &s;euere <HI>Cali&s;tines</HI> reprehended he &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Although in this Court we haue &s;undrie wi&s;e men, yet &s;ome|thyng maie &s;lippe thei can not &s;ee all, and where &s;o many mat|ters are &s;o often debated, no maruaile though rea&s;on bee &s;ome|thyng abated.</P>
<P><HI>Pithagoras</HI> with his owne hande, wrote this In&s;cription on his Schoole doore.</P>
<Q><L>Who &s;o knoweth not what he ought to knowe, is a bea&s;t among&s;t men,</L>
<L>He that knoweth no more then he hath need of, is a man among&s;t beastes,</L>
<L>He that knoweth that maie be, is a God among&s;t men.</L></Q>
<P>It maie well bee a iu&s;t Prince might pre&s;cribe this before the Court of <HI>Naples,</HI> but &s;hould he enter into the examination of the Premi&s;&s;es, I feare me he might worthely condemne the mo&s;t, who ought to knowe that exce&s;&s;e is vnnece&s;&s;arie, and yet our Courtiers doe commonly v&s;e it, and therefore bruti&s;he: Many we haue that knowe no more then thei neede of, and yet but men among&s;t brute bea&s;tes: but for tho&s;e that knowe all
<PB REF="33"> thynges, thei are but <HI>Pauci quos equus amauit Jupiter at&abque; ar|dens euexit ad athera virtus.</HI></P>
<P>Let <HI>Traian</HI> pre&s;cribe good lawes for eternall memorie, and yet where are thei &s;ooner broken then in the Court of <HI>Traian.</HI> Let <HI>Marcus aurelius</HI> &s;tore his Court with wi&s;emen, yet euen there thei waxe di&s;&s;olute. And our Court gui&s;e here is &s;uche, that in &s;horte &s;pace we learne to knowe what is ill, but for that is good, we can hardly compa&s;&s;e it in a long &s;ea&s;on. And how can it otherwi&s;e bee, that where all thynges are mini&s;tred to plea&s;e the appetite, that rea&s;on &s;hould preuaile: where all &s;tu|dies are to inuent vices, we &s;hould admitt vertue: where all our exerci&s;es are amorous, any one endeuour &s;hould be Philo|&s;ophicall: Cu&s;tome inuerteth all thynges: Errour de&s;troyeth all thynges, where onely &s;imilitudes &s;erueth the Court, what &s;hall become of &s;ub&s;taunce.</P>
<P>Truely if <HI>Catos</HI> cen&s;er, had as greate authoritie in our <HI>Na|politan</HI> Court as he had in <HI>Rome,</HI> and if the Animaduer&s;ions of Idlene&s;&s;e, were as au&s;tere here as thei were in his gouernme~t it was then, I feare me &s;ome of our nice Courtiers &s;hould ki&s;&s;e the <HI>Marmotiue,</HI> and beare tho&s;e corrections, whiche be fitted their follies.</P>
<P>In his gouernment, all <HI>Rome</HI> bani&s;hed Idlene&s;&s;e: in our go|uernment, noted vices growe and encrea&s;e Idlene&s;&s;e: where|vpon, it proueth that the braue&s;t Soldiour, is become the com|mone&s;t Courtier, and the furie of the &s;worde is &s;upplied, with the fame of the tongue: the mediocritie in diet and attire, to banquettyng in diet and brauerie in attire. Thus our whole Courte by Idlene&s;&s;e is made di&s;&s;olute: by cu&s;tome corrupt: where fa&s;hions fixe follie, follie breedes vanitie, bothe incon|&s;taunt.</P>
<P>This Courte in elder age, was accompted the Mother of Wi&s;emen, the &s;tepdame of Fooles: where now, a Foole &s;hall glorie of more fauour, then the Wi&s;eman of acceptaunce: And no maruell &s;ince the worlde as now runneth at this rate, that as Mothes eate the cloath, and the Cankerworme pearceth the Tree, &s;o flatteryng <HI>Sicophantes</HI> beguileth all the worlde. But for tho&s;e &s;ortes that depende on their de&s;artes, alas the
<PB REF="33"> while, I pittie their mi&s;fortunes, thei wantyng power and abi|litie to maintaine a parte, are put backe from compa&s;&s;yng be|nefite, and if in &s;triuyng to ari&s;e thei haue but one faune of for|tune, tho&s;e eyes that looke into al procedinges, and are watch|full onely to their owne profites, will preuent them, turnyng them of with a little preferment, not &s;ufferyng them to ri&s;e to hie, for lickyng the fatt from their fingers, &s;o that now adaies Promotion is determined in &s;uche &s;orte, as fan&s;ie rather con|firmeth the election then di&s;cretion, in &s;o muche that de&s;arte maie now goe a beggyng when all the worlde is guided by o|pinion.</P>
<P>But whereas we haue but lookt a little into the priuate ac|tions, attire, and externall practi&s;es of their life and founde &s;o muche errour, if we but now con&s;ider the inwarde di&s;po&s;ition of the mynde, of troth you maie wonder. The whole &s;tate of them tooth and naile, by all po&s;&s;ible meanes from their fir&s;t ri|&s;ing vp affectate honour, not by tho&s;e meanes that are requi|red in men of liberall mynde, but altogether accordyng to the nature of tho&s;e thei depende of. If <HI>Phaleris</HI> will torment, <HI>Pe|rillus</HI> will inuent: If <HI>Aemilius</HI> will martir, <HI>Paterculus</HI> will mini&s;ter: If <HI>Alexander</HI> will be &s;tately, <HI>Photion</HI> will be hum|ble: If <HI>Domitius</HI> fooli&s;he, <HI>Hipodamus</HI> will be franticke, euery greate mans vaine &s;hall haue a follower, and by the&s;e &s;teppes of &s;oothing Gouerners phanta&s;ies now adaies, our Courtiers &s;eeke to clime, rather the~ by any other action that is commen|dable: So though the honour thei attaine make the~ renowned in the face of the world, yet the meanes wherewith thei attaine are odious in the opinion of the wi&s;e&s;t. For what can bee more di&s;commendable, then for a noble mynd to applie it &s;elf to &s;er|uile functions? What booteth Nobilitie, where the man ma|kes hym&s;elf abiect? If glorie amid&s;t the vniuer&s;all benefites of fortune be cheefe&s;t, (for that it is the onely recorde of vertue, and vertue by no other meanes is to bee atchiued but by hone&s;t endeuours) I count hym infortunate that by contrarious &s;tep|pes would clime to it, and &s;eeking by vniu&s;t meanes to attaine beyng vnmeete for it.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e honours that dependeth vppon the opinion of
<PB REF="34"> Princes, as it is conceiued &s;o feareth it in an in&s;taunt: Tho&s;e titles of renowne in true glorie pa&s;&s;e by de&s;arte: in fained pre|ferment are committed by ca&s;ualtie: the proude borroweth the &s;tate and title of the humble: the humble of the proude: For where the Iudgement is in an vndi&s;creete eye, how can it o|therwi&s;e be, but that all thynges mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e by opinion. It was true honour grounded on de&s;arte, that preferred <HI>Fabius</HI> to the title of <HI>Maximus:</HI> It was the au&s;tere actions of <HI>Marilius,</HI> that made hym to bee tearmed <HI>Jmperio&s;us</HI> in vndoubted re|nowne. Therefore we &s;ee <HI>Simonides,</HI> the preferment without counterfaite, but in fained and momentany glorie (which bea|reth no &s;mall &s;waie in this Court) all runnes by heare&s;aies.</P>
<P>But this I dare boldly affirme, that if honours were to bee compa&s;t by vices, as in olde <HI>Rome</HI> thei were by vertues, there would more proue honourable (in our Court of <HI>Naples</HI>) in one yeare, then <HI>Rome</HI> had of good men in a whole age.</P>
<P>How many <HI>Democriti</HI> &s;hould we haue, that would deride al men accomptyng them mad, when he hym&s;elf was out of his witt? How many <HI>Epicuri</HI> that are led altogether with &s;en&s;uall lu&s;t, yet di&s;daine the &s;trickt life of others.</P>
<P>Truely if our <HI>Napolitans,</HI> had euery parte of their bodies, accordyng to the number of fa&s;hions they weare, they &s;hould haue Flemi&s;he heades to their Dutche hattes: Frenche faces to their marqui&s;otted cutt: Pari&s;ian neckes to their Parris ruffes: Italian bodies to their bigge bellies: Millian buttocks to their mincyng Breeches: Spani&s;h legges to their Spani&s;h Stockynges: Engli&s;he feete to their Engli&s;he Pantoffies: And if euery Countrey for his fa&s;hion might craue a member, I thinke it were more wi&s;edome in equall di&s;tribution of eche Countre is parte, then witt to acquaint our members with &s;o many Countrey fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>Truely it were better for a Courtier with the <HI>Atlantibae,</HI> rather to want his name, then good nurture: for vnnamed his honour &s;hall not grow in que&s;tion, but &s;poken of, his vices &s;hall be noted.</P>
<P>But to let &s;lippe our men Courtiers, with their affectation of honour, with their vnorderly meanes to attaine renowne,
<PB REF="34"> let vs now turne to our Courtlike Ladies, and wee &s;hall finde there was not &s;o much varietie in the one, but there is twi&s;e as muche vanitie in the other: the Gentleman is not &s;o fooli&s;he, but the Gentlewoman is euen as fonde: &s;o that bothe of them are coupled in a lea&s;e of agreeable follies: the one to followe, the other to intice. The&s;e Damo&s;elles can make Emperours idle as <HI>Authony:</HI> Valiaunt men effeminate as <HI>Hercules:</HI> wi&s;e|men di&s;&s;olute as <HI>Salomon:</HI> Eloquent men la&s;ciuious as <HI>Au|relius:</HI> their eyes haue power attractiue: thei neuer prie but thei pearce: neuer glaunce but thei conquer, &s;o that none but <HI>Mer|curie,</HI> can abridge their &s;leightes to entrap: nor ought but wi&s;e|dome, preuaile again&s;t their &s;ugred inticementes. I haue kno|wen the braue&s;t Courtier in <HI>Naples,</HI> to daie brauely mounted traue&s;ing the Streates, richly demeined, brauely attired, and beyng ouercome but by a glauncyng pa&s;&s;ion, the next daie in mynde malancholie: in habite mournefull: in gate incon&s;tant: nay, in all actions not hym&s;elf, &s;uche pearce haue the&s;e Ladies eyes, and thei be&s;towe them &s;o cunningly, that makyng out their choyce on the Idele&s;t, thei alwaies become conquerers. No Nouice maie &s;cape their handes, but from Heauen with <HI>Prometheus</HI> he bringes away &s;ome flame: So that in the Prin|ces Court (I dare auowe) there are more at this in&s;taunt ina|moured, then of continent habitude.</P>
<P><HI>Madami&s;ella</HI> her &s;elf what practi&s;eth &s;he not, this youth mu&s;t bee her &s;eruaunt and weare her colours, that Gentleman her Partner and weare her &s;leeue, a third her Louer and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;e vncha&s;t bed plea&s;ures: And though the two fir&s;t bee as la|ui&s;he in their giftes as the la&s;t, yet thei both are for&s;t to hold the Candle, while the other offers to our Ladie. Suche bee the&s;e Gentlewomen, that thei haue tongues to traine, eyes to alure, bodies to performe: no opertunitie with them &s;hall be let &s;lippe for a plea&s;ure: nothing pretermitted to make them&s;elues fini&s;h.</P>
<P>In their youthly beauties, thei procure many fauourers, who led by colours not &s;ub&s;taunce, thinkes that the olde pain|ted face of <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI> is the &s;ame it was when &s;he fir&s;t became <HI>Plutos</HI> wife. Thei haue colours to be rubie tallowe faces, me|dicine to allaie gro&s;e humours, Ma&s;kes to couer deformed vi|&s;ages,

<P>The&s;e makes our youthes to bee di&s;&s;olute, not &s;tudious: a|morous, not venterous: wanton, not wi&s;e: curious, not co~&s;tant. In &s;o muche that you maie &s;ee here as muche ryot, as in <HI>Rome</HI> &s;u&s;pected Religion.</P>
<P>This is the demeanure of the Court of <HI>Naples,</HI> this haue I &s;eene and learned by myne owne experience. And for this <HI>Si|monides,</HI> as thou &s;aie&s;t thou art come to <HI>Naples,</HI> if to e&s;chewe by &s;eeyng, and not to practi&s;e by beholding, I thinke no man bet|ter welcome then my Countrey man, but if to followe that whiche I haue pa&s;t ouer with repentaunce, no man &s;oner wi&s;ht from hence thence <HI>Simonides.</HI></P>

<PB REF="38">
<P>In the Citie of <HI>Scienna</HI> (a plea&s;aunt &amp; commodious towne, renowned a&s;well for the brauerie of the noble, as the wealth of the Marchaunt, and &s;tored with greate foy&s;on of beautifull Damo&s;els) there dwelt a &s;ixe yeares agoe an honourable and renowned Magnifico called <HI>Sertorius,</HI> who hauyng large &s;ummes of money in mo&s;t of our bankes of <HI>Jtaly;</HI> growne at la&s;t to the greate&s;t e&s;timation in the Citie, and ble&s;t euery waie with the be&s;t &s;upplies of fortune, was onely depriued of this comfort, that he was wiuele&s;&s;e: to the remedie whereof, he en|deuoured to ca&s;t his eyes abroade, mindyng to fixe his fan&s;ie on &s;ome faire yong damo&s;ell, by who&s;e companie in his declining yeares, he might perhappes be beautified with i&s;&s;ue and heires to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e his inheritaunce. At the la&s;t by long trauell, hauyng attained the &s;ight of a delicate yong Maiden, by birthe noble, and of pa&s;&s;yng beautie, one of the Daughters of the <HI>Signiors</HI> of the Citie called <HI>Brunellus,</HI> the Virgines name <HI>Orienta,</HI> he &s;ought by all meanes po&s;&s;ible, how he might be&s;t imploye hym &s;elf to the attainement of his purpo&s;e. In the ende, he &s;olicited the Father, que&s;tioned with the Mother, vi&s;ited the Daughter, he cloathed hym&s;elf in vnaccu&s;tomed colours, maqui&s;ityng his Munch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ches to looke youthly, &s;tretchyng out his &s;tarke limmes almo&s;t wrethen with age after the fa&s;hion of a Monar|ko: &s;o that without all peraduentures, he per&s;waded hym&s;elf he &s;hould &s;peede he was &s;o frolike. Wherevpon (after the Italian gui&s;e) he concluded with the father and freends, who more alo|wing of his wealth then of his goodly per&s;onage, thei brought hym in the ende to the &s;peeche of the Daughter.</P>
<P>She beyng yong, tender, faire, amiable, and full of all gra|ces, and &s;eeyng her &s;elf &s;ued too by &s;uche an olde cru&s;t, began e|uen with a &s;milyng regarde to pretende what was to followe, and beyng curteou&s;ly &s;aluted by <HI>Sertorius,</HI> &s;he returned hym a requitall.

<P>Mi&s;tris <HI>Orienta,</HI> that &s;weete beautie of yours, whiche is a|ble to &s;ubdue the mo&s;t indurat affection of the wi&s;e&s;t, and con|quer the greate&s;t re&s;i&s;t of the &s;tronge&s;t, hath made me your pri|&s;oner, not otherwi&s;e able to be deliuered fro~ the martirdome of Loue, but onely by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your fauour, wherevppon
<PB REF="38"> my poore harte feedeth all his &s;weete&s;t contemplation. And though my yeares perhappes maie make breach betwene your tender delicacie and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> forworne age, yet per&s;wade your &s;elf thus, that although I am not the onely to be liked, yet knowe I throughly, I haue not in me vtterly to be loathed, what eue|ry yeare &s;hall di&s;wade in myne age, I can recompence it with a ca&s;ke of Crownes: and for wealth, <HI>Italy</HI> &s;hall not afforde you a better hou&s;band, though for youth it maie alowe you more to be accompted of. This writhen bodie (&s;weete Damo&s;ell) maie perhappes afforde you as muche hone&s;t plea&s;ure, as one more nice: other &s;upplies muche more and farre better. Wherefore ge~tle <HI>Orienta</HI> vouch&s;afe me fauour: for if you &s;houl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> once mar|tir me with repul&s;e (alas the while) my life would proue but death, and my happie and ble&s;&s;ed daies &s;hould be determined.</P>
<P>The yong Gentlewoman, hauyng heard her lu&s;tie Woers &s;uite, replied thus.</P>
<P>Me thinkes <HI>Signior Sertorius,</HI> your yeares beyng almo&s;te growne to their date, you &s;hould not be giuen to doate, and the heires of experience beautifiyng your head, you &s;hould with good aduerti&s;ement call your &s;elf home.</P>
<P>To &s;hape an Oxe and an A&s;&s;e in one Plough, were but a mockerie: to place hot and colde in one con&s;ert, were as great follie: to ioyne age and youth in vowed Wedlocke, were very noy&s;ome: how can there be agreement, where all thynges are contrary: or loue, where the parties be loth&s;ome.</P>
<P>Twere better to be buried hone&s;tly cha&s;t, then to be a Bride in an olde mans bed.</P>
<P>One of your feete <HI>Signior Sertorius,</HI> is in the graue, the other declinyngly bendyng, can not brooke long to vpholde &s;o croo|ked a cor&s;e.</P>
<P>I in my prime of youth, natiue heate, cheefe beautie, like to maintaine combat again&s;t the fates a long tyme.</P>
<P>You if perhappes (as I doubt me) you &s;peede of that you &s;peake for, when your &s;mall heate is &s;ati&s;fied, will tipe vp your heeles, and leaue poore <HI>Orienta,</HI> a &s;orrowfull Widowe, and ha|uing mourned a little for maners &s;ake, findyng my &s;elf vncom|bered from &s;uche a loath&s;ome burthen, might di&s;porte my &s;elf
<PB REF="39"> at my plea&s;ure, and make my &s;elf ble&s;&s;ed in my newe choyce.</P>
<P>Noble Magnifico, thinke you of your Beades, not of your bed: of your Mattins, not of your Marriage: It is now tyme to fini&s;he your accompt of plea&s;ure, &s;ince your principall per|formaunce is extingui&s;hed. As for me, let me alone &s;illie maide as I am, there be more fitter in <HI>Scienna</HI> for you to wed then my &s;elf, and more meeter for me to match then with you.</P>
<P>Thus de&s;iring <HI>Signior Sertorius</HI> to beare with <HI>Orientas</HI> rude|ne&s;&s;e, &s;he takes her leaue mynded to followe her bu&s;ine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>This olde amorous Gentleman, hauyng bin galled &s;o nere|ly, as &s;carce he could bridle his choler, yet yeeldyng to the re|pul&s;e for the pre&s;ent, not doubtyng but in tyme the humour would ouerpa&s;&s;e, and that by her freendes per&s;wa&s;ion, his Mi|&s;tris would bee pacified. This notwith&s;tandyng, he continued his wonted porte, fea&s;tyng the Father, flatteryng the Mother, pre&s;entyng the Daughter, who delighted not in &s;uche &s;tale youthes, &s;o that opertunitie (or the importunitie of the fates) &s;erued, that to fru&s;trate his enterpri&s;e, Loue began to wring the harte of a yong Gentleman, one of the &s;ame Citie, who fin|dyng his pa&s;&s;ion no otherwi&s;e recurable, but by the fauour of <HI>Orienta,</HI> practi&s;ed in what he might to compa&s;&s;e his purpo&s;e, towarde the attainement of her good grace, in &s;o muche, that as occa&s;ions were proffered, if <HI>Orienta</HI> would be holy, <HI>Fuluius</HI> would goe to Churche: if di&s;po&s;ed to walke for recreation, her &s;uppliaunt mu&s;t take the ayre.</P>
<P>Thus pre&s;entyng fire to the flaxe, the vncurable heate of the torment inflamed the yeeldyng affectes of the yong Damo&s;ell to receiue the impre&s;&s;ion, that being bothe touched with equall de&s;ire, the yong man perplexed by rea&s;on of the matche the fa|ther pretended with <HI>Sertorius,</HI> &s;he holding backe by maidenlike &s;hamefa&s;tne&s;&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he was vnproffered, and bothe of them otherwi&s;e deteined then thei wi&s;ht for. The noble courage of the yong Gentleman, led by a &s;milyng hope of heauenly re|warde for a &s;mall aduenture, compa&s;&s;yng in his cogitations many matters: At la&s;t he be thought hym&s;elf of his acquain|taunce with <HI>Sertorius,</HI> who&s;e wanton woyng was knowne ve|ry well through all <HI>Scienna,</HI> by hym onely in his mynd, he con|cluded
<PB REF="39"> the attainement of his purpo&s;e, though in deed his one|ly enemie in this attempt.</P>
<P><HI>Fuluius</HI> hauyng &s;ought hym out, with &s;ubtill information, he &s;aluted hym thus.</P>
<P><HI>Signior Sertorius,</HI> the olde familiaritie betweene my father and you, and the report of your curteous and hone&s;t dealynges in <HI>Scienna,</HI> hath made me (being forced thereunto by nece&s;&s;itie) to come and craue your fauour.</P>
<P>Thus it is, that beyng greatly indebted in <HI>Scienna,</HI> by rea|&s;on of continuall &s;uites betweene the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Corua&s;ij</HI> and me, for a certaine Ca&s;tle betweene this and <HI>Aranthum,</HI> I am forced now by the Iudiciall decree, to buye their parte, and to this i&s;&s;ue altogether vnfurni&s;hed of money, I am to &s;ell or mor|gage certaine Reuenues, to the accompli&s;hing of my purpo&s;e. Wherevpon (good <HI>Signior</HI>) if either vpon morgage or &s;ale, it plea&s;e you to furni&s;he me with one thou&s;ande Duckettes, I &s;hall by this meanes, not onely be greatly bounde vnto you for your fauour, but al&s;o if in any &s;eruice I maie &s;tande in &s;tead, pre&s;t at your commaunde.</P>
<P>The old Foxe though his lippes did water, di&s;&s;embling to loue no Grapes, aun&s;wered <HI>Fuluius</HI> thus.</P>
<P>Good <HI>Fuluius,</HI> the nobilitie of the Hou&s;e you come of, the faithfull freend&s;hip betweene your father and me, with the to|ward and honourable behauiour of your &s;elf, were &s;ufficient to inforce a &s;traunger, muche more a freend to plea&s;ure you. But when I looke into my pre&s;ent e&s;tate, and &s;ee the occa&s;ions I haue to imploye my money, truely I am loth to &s;et foote in the cau&s;e: notwith&s;tandyng, to plea&s;ure &s;o hone&s;t a Gentleman as you, if you be mynded to &s;ell any Signorie, I will &s;traine my &s;elf you &s;hal haue money, <HI>Fuluius</HI> &s;hal finde a frend of <HI>Sertorius.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;eemyng very de&s;irous, gaue our Magni|fico hartie thankes, a&s;&s;uryng hym that to the aduenture of his life, he would requite the fauour &s;hewed him. Herevpon he ma|kes price of a mo&s;t plea&s;aunt and beautifull Maner hou&s;e with the demeanes, &s;ituate out of <HI>Scienna</HI> fiue or &s;ixe Leagues, the bargaine is beaten out and accordingly agreed vpon, that <HI>Ser|torius</HI> &s;hall haue the Fee &s;imple of the Signorie of <HI>Brentio,

At this tyme <HI>Sertorius</HI> bethinkyng hym&s;elf of <HI>Brunellus</HI> with his faire <HI>Orienta,</HI> began to &s;ay thus in his owne imagination.</P>
<P>Oh happie bargaine for me, this is a pa&s;&s;yng pre&s;ent for my <HI>Orienta,</HI> I doubt not but if giftes will plea&s;e the Goddes, re|wardes maie entice women: And on this he concluded in hym &s;elf to delaie the liuerie and &s;ea&s;on for one moneth, at whiche tyme, he be&s;ought <HI>Fuluius</HI> to make honourable preparation for hym and his companie: addyng this moreouer, that the onely Gemme he de&s;ired in the world, &s;hould be there at the banquet.</P>
<P><HI>Fuluius</HI> perceiuyng how the game would goe, promi&s;ed to performe what he required, and beyng a&s;&s;ured by <HI>Sertorius</HI> to receiue his readie money he departed, and labouryng by &s;un|drie meanes to come to the &s;peech of <HI>Orienta,</HI> he fel in acquain|taunce with an olde Gentlewoman, who had often recour&s;e to the hou&s;e of <HI>Brunellus,</HI> and priuie familiaritie with <HI>Orienta,</HI> to whom <HI>Fuluius</HI> opened the bitter a&s;&s;aultes of his pa&s;&s;ion, and betw&eacute;ene faire &s;peeches and liberall rewardes he &s;o compa&s;&s;ed this woman, that &s;he promi&s;ed not onely to preferre his &s;uite, but al&s;o to applie what per&s;wa&s;ion &s;he thought nece&s;&s;arie, to|warde the attainement of the Maidens fauour.</P>

Wherevpon, cal|lyng a &s;orte of his courteous Companions together, it was a|greed thei would make the Bridegrome priuie to their com|myng, who accepting of their curte&s;ie in mo&s;t freendly maner, promi&s;ed them a hartie welcome.</P>
<P>All thynges prepared for this purpo&s;e, the next daie came <HI>Orienta</HI> with her father and mother to the &s;olemni&s;ing of this Weddyng.</P>
<P>Our &s;nudge Magnifico, is there in his be&s;t colours to court it: Night beyng come, the Ma&s;kers beyng mounted on great Hor&s;es, apparelled after the Turkie fa&s;hion all in cloath of Ti&s;&s;ue entered the greate Court, where di&s;mountyng them &s;elues, thei orderly marched into the great Chamber, the com|pany
<PB REF="41"> attentiuely beholding the brauerie of the Ma&s;kers, <HI>Ful|uius</HI> had giuen his compartners a le&s;&s;on, whereby <HI>Orienta</HI> was left for his owne choyce, whom &s;oftly taking by the hande, and with a coye regarde, &s;he &s;eemed at the fir&s;t to &s;traine curte&s;ie, but ea&s;ely per&s;waded to that &s;he mo&s;t de&s;ired: after thei had pa|ced the fir&s;t mea&s;ure, eche Ma&s;ker fallyng to the courtyng of his Ladie, <HI>Fuluius</HI> began his di&s;cour&s;e in this &s;orte.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion (&s;weete Mi&s;tris) that you alowed me, is euen now happely atchiued, and he that was bolde to &s;ue in paper, is now here readie to performe in per&s;on, here is your loyall &s;worne &s;eruaunt <HI>Fuluius,</HI> who without your gracious a&s;pect, mu&s;t fini&s;he his life with vnmercifull martirdome.</P>
<P>Here interrupted by the Mu&s;itions, and hauyng traced on neatly the other <HI>Corranto, Orienta</HI> aun&s;wered.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o iniurious <HI>Signior Fuluius,</HI> but I will adde one benefite to hym that preferreth all occa&s;ions: and if in cha&s;t loue, &s;o good a Gentleman as you hath vowed your &s;eruice, it maie be his chaunce to finde as con&s;taunt a freend to yeeld him his rewarde.</P>
<P>Here interrupted againe, at the third pau&s;e <HI>Fuluius</HI> &s;pake thus.</P>
<P>For benefites that &s;hall pa&s;&s;e from Beautie, <HI>Fuluius</HI> will be thankfull, and if it &s;hall plea&s;e <HI>Orienta,</HI> to fit all occa&s;ions &s;o well as &s;he framed this, <HI>Fuluius</HI> &s;hall no doubt finde a remedie, and his Mi&s;tris &s;hall not repent her.</P>
<P>Here the in&s;taunt that interrupted the Louer, &s;hortly &s;erued the Ladie, who di&s;cour&s;ed thus.</P>
<P>My &s;weete freend, if the Mi&s;tris of thy harte, will be per|&s;waded by my meanes, feare not, but ere long &s;he will make ei|ther time &s;erue affection, or both &s;ati&s;fie thy expectatio~. Wher|vpon, de&s;iring hym to be circum&s;pect, for feare of &s;u&s;pition (for the Magnificoes eyes were watchfull ouer her) the Gentle|man refrained vntill the Ma&s;ke being ended, and eche Gentle|man accompanied with his Mi&s;tris went to banquet, he choo|&s;ing a conuenient corner to di&s;couer him&s;elf to <HI>Orienta,</HI> in the&s;e tearmes per&s;waded with her.</P>

<P>And lieth it in me &s;weete freend (&s;aid <HI>Orienta</HI>) to performe, truely then giue me in&s;tructions, and I wil quickly haue them without booke.</P>
<P>Then gracious <HI>Orienta</HI> (&s;aied <HI>Fuluius</HI>) thus it &s;tandeth, I &s;eeyng no meanes to attaine the di&s;couery of myne affections towardes you, of late colourably went and compa&s;&s;ed with the olde Magnifico your Woer, to &s;ell a peece of Lande, by that meanes thinkyng to wring out &s;omewhat, by growyng in fa|miliaritie with hym, but the Foxe beyng wylie, &s;et me be&s;ide the Co&s;hin, yet greedily gapyng after my Reuenues, was con|tented to imploye twelue thou&s;and Crownes for a Manner of myne liyng &s;ixe Leagues from out this Citie, de&s;iryng me to make honourable proui&s;ion for his comming that day moneth, for that the &s;weete&s;t Gemme in the worlde &s;hould be there with hym.

<P>The quicke wit of the yong Maiden, conceiuing at the fir&s;t the conueiaunce of all, &s;milyngly thus interrupted hym.</P>

<P>This &s;edull ouer read by one of the cheefe&s;t Magi&s;trates of the Citie, the whole a&s;&s;emblie continued mute along &s;pace, in the ende, an auncient Philo&s;opher (as he &s;eemed) be&s;pake him thus.</P>
<P>Vn&s;earchable (O ye <HI>Athenians</HI>) is the power of the Godes, by who&s;e benefites, &s;ince this Towne hath been a long tyme maintained, yet cea&s;e thei not by their euerla&s;tyng wi&s;domes, to continue it, to who&s;e beneficence, if we compare our ingra|titude, we &s;hall iu&s;tly conclude, that the Godes created vs to many vertues, and wee haue bound our &s;elues bond&s;laues to mon&s;trous vices: If therefore we looke into our owne &s;tates, and compare our aunciters good, with our ill, we &s;hal confirme <HI>Licurgus</HI> dead te&s;timonie, and pointyng to our be&s;t <HI>Athenian</HI> Philo&s;ophers, we &s;hall touch this one with the blot of auerice, and note that other with the blemi&s;he of vaine glorie.</P>
<P>If by the hidden workyng of the Godes we are put in me|morie of our e&s;capes, let vs mend them. And &s;ince with more fauour then to other Cities, thei haue ble&s;&s;ed vs with more circom&s;pection, in reuerence of their bountie let vs become more circom&s;pecte.</P>
<P>This &s;cedull pre&s;enteth vnto our Prince pollicie: to our
<PB REF="52"> Religious &s;anctimonie: to our Layetie continency. By exce&s;&s;e onely we are found to haue falne, hauing gathered in &s;o many yeres ouer pa&s;&s;ed, many errors, recouered no vertues. Oh hap|pie <HI>Athens,</HI> when <HI>Agis</HI> not re&s;pectyng the furie of his com|parte nor Kyng, began to pull downe the pride of <HI>Athens.</HI> Oh vnfortunate Citie when by the diligence of <HI>Pericles,</HI> Golde brought pride into <HI>Athens.</HI> We &s;tand ama&s;ed now confoun|ded in our &s;elues by our &s;eldome a&s;&s;pectes, impartyng the gil|tine&s;&s;e of our conciences, neither hauyng that confirmitie of mynd in vs that befitteth Philo&s;ophers, nor that valewe to at|tempt as in the daies of the Law maker <HI>Licurgus</HI> we once had. If we will be wi&s;e, why are our attemptes &s;auced with repen|taunce: if learned, why are we blind in di&s;cipline. If we reme~|ber our &s;elues of our former e&s;tates, how we haue been glori|fied in our well doyng, contemned in our ill, how accounted of for our expeditions, how di&s;dained for our flatteries, we &s;hal find all our goodes to procede from good coun&s;aile, as our bad|des from contempt of the Godes.</P>
<P>So that now thus it &s;tandeth, &s;ince the floudes, the fates, yea the <HI>Fli&s;ian</HI> feildes are &s;o fauourable, that the one ca&s;teth vp, the other ble&s;&s;eth, the la&s;t greeteth vs with heauenly documen|tes and nece&s;&s;ary forewarninges, let the head rule the feet, eche member folow the &s;uperior, all conclud in a mediocritie, and not only leaue tho&s;e memories ingrafted in table of record, but al&s;o imprinte them in our hartes, to the &s;ati&s;faction whereof, O you <HI>Athenian</HI> Senators, I coniure you to applie all your &s;tudies.</P>
<P>The graue old father hauing thus fini&s;hed his oration, ech alowed his coun&s;aile, and the Magi&s;trates of the Citie hauing accordyng to the direction of the &s;edull, redeliuered the coffin vnto the flouds, with many &s;olemne cerimonies performed vn|to <HI>Neptune,</HI> thei vppon adui&s;ed deliberation, did commit the &s;crole vnto the common trea&s;ure, as an euerla&s;tyng and me|morable miracle.</P>
<P><HI>Fuphues</HI> and <HI>Simonides</HI> beholdyng all the&s;e thinges with incredible admiration, departed towarde their lodgyng, where after thei had a while re&s;ted them&s;elues, <HI>Euphues</HI> brake of their

<P>It is neither occa&s;ion (noble Spaniard) that preferreth, nor pollicie whiche procureth but the Godes whiche fauour the&s;e actions.</P>
<P>Thou art come to <HI>Athens</HI> to &s;ee but blind guides, yea, blind are we in coulers that &s;hould know all proportions.</P>
<P><HI>Fredericke</HI> my freende, hath pre&s;ented thee with a flower without &s;ent, with a bare &s;hadow ond no &s;ub&s;tance, with a ver|tuous towne in name, but bad in nature. So that vnle&s;&s;e thou can&s;te make of venemous confections, hol&s;ome Triacles, of poy&s;onable <HI>Mummi</HI> comfortable <HI>Methridat,</HI> in &s;eekyng here for <HI>Sibill</HI> thou &s;halt encounter a <HI>Siren,</HI> and for the image of <HI>A|lexandre</HI> the protrature of <HI>Jrus.</HI></P>
<P>I haue &s;een much <HI>(Simonides)</HI> and marked &s;omewhat, yet in <HI>Athens</HI> neuer knew I more fooles le&s;&s;e Philo&s;ophers. The Ro&s;e &s;auoreth &s;weetly yet hath his prickell, <HI>Mercurie</HI> is &s;now white yet deadly poi&s;on, the Peacocke faire plumed yet black footed, the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;weete tonged yet ill manired.</P>
<P>If as <HI>Demo&s;tines</HI> trauiled to <HI>Corinth,</HI> to inioy <HI>Layes, Simonides</HI> be come to <HI>Athens</HI> to learne fa&s;hions, as the Philo&s;opher di&s;|dained to be laui&s;he for a little plea&s;ure, <HI>Simonides</HI> will bee as curious to imitat &s;o vaine pre&s;identes.</P>
<P>In <HI>Athens</HI> it fareth now, as in <HI>Rome</HI> it did once, here plenty maketh vs proud, their high honours made them haughtei.</P>
<P>As the&s;e errours I note are incident to the&s;e Cities, &s;o are the vertues the nominated in &s;edull, practi&s;ed farre of from this Citie, which when better opportunitie &s;erueth, I will not onely vtter to thy plea&s;ure, but al&s;o open to thy profite. Meane tyme, if it plea&s;e thee to take parte of a Scholers repa&s;t, thou &s;halt haue the benefite perhappes of a morrall di&s;cour&s;e, which may make recompence for the &s;lenderne&s;&s;e of thy diet.</P>
<P><HI>Simonides,</HI> comparyng all <HI>Euphues</HI> curte&s;ies together, knit vp his aun&s;wer in this forme.</P>
<P>The benefite that is reapt by good coun&s;aile (gentle <HI>Eu|phues</HI>) as it profiteth him that by experience vttereth, &s;o con|firmeth it the other who as yet was ignorant.</P>
<P>So fareth it with me, that hearyng tho&s;e &s;age preceptes
<PB REF="53"> that pa&s;&s;e from thee: I am not onely per&s;waded of the &s;ingu|laritie of thy wi&s;dome, but al&s;o inured to the imitation of thy vertues. Many ca&s;ualties happen, whiche although thei be be|neficiall vniuar&s;allie, yet confirme they &s;ome one perticuler more then the re&s;t, and I thinke that the&s;e ca&s;ualties as now hath happened in <HI>Athens,</HI> when as &s;uch a one at the in&s;tante is re&s;ident, who with eloquence may blazen out the myracu|lou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the accident, and by good admonition &s;ubdue the errours of this Citie.</P>
<P>As I came to <HI>Athens</HI> to &s;ee it, &s;o &s;ailed I hether to here thee, and though the delight of the one bee &s;omewhat aun&s;werable to my trauell, yet thy eloquence is that whiche onely excedeth the report.</P>
<P>For this Citie, I find it more faughtie then famous, for thee, more learned then I haue yet hard &s;poken.</P>
<P>As for the noueltie that latly happined, if &s;o the &s;tate be ru|led any where as there it is &s;et downe, I doubt not but peace hath there &s;eated her &s;elf in &s;ecuritie, &amp; that either the Climate is &s;o gratious that all are wi&s;e from their cradell, and all for|tunate by the benifit of the place. For thy repa&s;t, I accept it: for thy morrall di&s;cour&s;e I wi&s;he for it, and de&s;ire in as &s;horte &s;pace I might be made copartner of thy conformitie, as I &s;hall with thankfull harte bee pertaker of thy diet. This &s;aied, thei &s;at downe, and hauyng &s;ati&s;fied them &s;elues with &s;uche proui|&s;ion as then was prepared for them, <HI>Euphues</HI> at length began thus.</P>
<P><HI>Simonides,</HI> though the cour&s;ene&s;&s;e of thy diet bee not accor|ding to the bountie of the court, yet here among&s;t vs &s;tudents, we rather e&s;teme of a <HI>Socraticum conuiuium,</HI> than the exce&s;&s;iue dainties of the banquets of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> thinking that no more than nece&s;&s;ary repa&s;t is requi&s;ite for the profe&s;&s;ors of &s;ciences, e&s;pecially to &s;ati&s;fie nature, whereas in re&s;pecte of the &s;oule it can not be &s;ufficiently confirmed with the &s;weete preceptes of philo&s;ophie.</P>
<P>Truely &abquod; <HI>Simonides</HI> (interrupting <HI>Euphues,</HI>) &s;uche as the complections of the bodie and the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oule is, &s;uch e&s;teeme I the externall actions, and the internal delight,
<PB REF="53"> as for this meale we haue made, wee haue I confe&s;&s;e &s;uffici|ently &s;erued our appetites, but for the &s;oule, it hathe &s;undrie o|perations, and what one likes, another loathes.</P>
<P>Truth it is, &s;aide <HI>Euphues,</HI> that <HI>&V;enus</HI> delighteth her &s;elfe in daliance, where <HI>Diana</HI> alonely aloweth cha&s;titie, <HI>Democri|tus</HI> &s;oliciteth him &s;elfe in laughter, but wi&s;e <HI>Cato</HI> in grauitie and &s;adne&s;&s;e: eche nature as it is di&s;po&s;ed fo worketh it, which maketh apparance euen nowe in my &s;elfe, who tho whilome I liked loue, nowe loath I lu&s;te, though once I counted <HI>Cupid</HI> for a God, nowe I account vaine loue godle&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>But it may be <HI>Simonides</HI> in this my nature, and your con|&s;titution we di&s;agree, you fire, I fro&s;t, you amorous, I &s;tudi|ous, which if it be &s;o, I doubt not but to &s;itte &s;uch occa&s;ions, as touching that mo&s;t neare&s;t which hitteth you mo&s;t feately, I may in this imitate <HI>Phirne</HI> the harlot, who beeing pre&s;ented by <HI>Praxetiles</HI> the Painter with that picture which &s;oeuer that be&s;t wiihin his whole &s;torie &s;houlde plea&s;e hir fanta&s;ie, &s;he very carefull to make a warie choice of &s;o plea&s;aunt a gi&s;te, cau&s;ed one &s;odainely to informe the Painter that hys &s;hoppe was on fire, who among&s;t the re&s;t of his tables, demaunding if the pi|cture of <HI>Cupid</HI> was vnuiolated, was cunningly compa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Phirne</HI> in this, who &s;ati&s;fied hir expectation by the opinion of tye workemai&s;ter him&s;elfe.

<P>Although thy eloquence &s;houlde make me <HI>Argus,</HI> yet the matter thou talke&s;t of inforctth mee to bee <HI>Endemon,</HI> what is &s;ubdued in thee, is rooted in mee, &s;o that, thoughe per&s;wa&s;ion may confirme for a while, yet if fancie doe but a little kindle the coales, we &s;hal &s;oone haue fire: but for that night calleth on, and I de&s;ire to be more readie to morrowe, to heare the ac|compli&s;hment of thy promi&s;e touching the Iland thou talke&s;t of, I be&s;eech thee let vs v&s;e the aduice of our pillows, whether this nights di&s;cour&s;e be auaileable.</P>
<P>And doe <HI>Simonides</HI> (&abquod; <HI>Euphues</HI>) &s;o perchaunce at Sunne ri&s;ing, thou wilt either repent thee of a folly, or remember th&eacute;e of a good le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, <HI>Euphues</HI> conueied <HI>Simonides</HI> to his Lodging, and after betooke hym&s;elf to his owne couch, where repo&s;ing them &s;elues a conuenient &s;pace, at la&s;t the me&s;&s;enger of the Sunne with plea&s;aunt redne&s;&s;e be coloured <HI>Euphues</HI> face: who beeyng very &s;tudious betooke hym&s;elf to his bookes: And after &s;ome deliberation, thinking it good time to goe vi&s;ite his new gue&s;t, he came vnto hym whom he founde readie, and after a gentle <HI>Bon ioure</HI> pa&s;t betwene them, thei determined to take the aire: And walkyng out into a plea&s;aunt Groue, hauyng a goodly pro&s;pect into both Sea and Champion: for it was eminent, <HI>Si|monides</HI> began thus.</P>
<P>Feeend <HI>Euphues,</HI> beholdyng now the waue, whiche pre&s;en|ted <HI>Athens</HI> ye&s;terdaie with <HI>Licurgus</HI> good coun&s;aile, I am brought in memorie of a certaine report of yours, wherein you
<PB REF="56"> &s;pecified an Ilande, whereas tho&s;e documentes were practi&s;ed whiche the &s;edull pre&s;ented, maie it plea&s;e you now, from your bitter inuectiues again&s;t Loue, to fall to your worthie declara|tion of this Ilande, wherevpon perhappes I maie be per&s;wa|ded, that hauyng pa&s;t ouer a greate parte of the worlde co &s;ee fa&s;hions, I maie make a fewe monethes &s;aile thether to learne vertue.</P>
<P><HI>Euphues</HI> hauyng pau&s;ed a little &s;pace, in the ende brake out into the&s;e &s;peaches.</P>
<P>Truely <HI>Simonides,</HI> thou at this in&s;taunt per&s;wade&s;t me to the remembrauece of that in whiche once, hauyng placed my cheefe&s;t felicitie, I now am almo&s;t raui&s;hed with the remem|braunce onely of the place.</P>
<P>Thou de&s;ire&s;t a report of that noble Spanyard, which with out wonder I did not &s;ee, nor without plea&s;ure thou can&s;t not heare.</P>
<P>And herevpon I can not imagine, whether with more admi|ration I maie &s;peake of the &s;ituation of the place, or the di&s;po|&s;ition of the people, the one is &s;o worthely fenced by nature, the other &s;o noblie nurtured by vertue.</P>
<P>For the Ilande it &s;elf, in olde tyme it hath been called <HI>Al|bion,</HI> and after by the ariuall of the <HI>Troyan</HI> Trauailer <HI>Brutus,</HI> it was called <HI>Britanie,</HI> afterwarde brought vnder the gouerne|ment of <HI>Engustus,</HI> it was called <HI>Engu&s;tland,</HI> and dy &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as now continueth the name of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Gouernours hereof by their manifolde vertues, haue not onely filled <HI>Europe,</HI> but al&s;o repleni&s;hed <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the Climate very beneficial for proui&s;ion to maintaine a State, neither wa~|tyng Wooll for clothyng, nor Corne and Cattle for foode: So that if any one Countrey in the worlde bee ble&s;&s;ed with bene|fites, I thinke this Iland happie, beyng fenced by the <HI>Occean</HI> again&s;t forraine Inua&s;ions, and gouerned by good lawes to a|uoyde populer Mutinies.</P>
<P>The Princes haue euer been ruled by di&s;crete gouernours, thei haue conquered and &s;ubdued many Nations, the <HI>Jri&s;he</HI> are vnder their &s;ubiection, from the French by Conque&s;t thei bare a title: yea, &s;o happie this Nation is, as in their peace all Prin|ces
<PB REF="57"> wonder, and in their fauour eche Countrey glorieth.</P>
<P>So that it can hardly be &s;aied, whether thei bee more feared for their power, or honoured for their prowe&s;&s;e. Generally, thei are all valiaunt not fearyng Warlike attemptes, but with as greate wi&s;edome preuent, as with valewe thei performe.</P>
<P>Of per&s;onage thei are &s;eemely, of behauiour comely, of ap|parell co&s;tly, in entertainyng &s;traungers none more readie: re|ligious thei be without hipocri&s;ie: &s;erious in preferryng their Countrey: to their fr&eacute;endes Lambes: to their enemies Lyons.</P>
<P>The men beyng thus, what more to bee wondered at then their women: Beautie in them hath be&s;towed her &s;weete&s;t co|lours: Nature hath benefited them with all &s;eemely proportio~: Art fini&s;hed them with &s;cience and affabilitie.</P>
<P>They are &s;weete in behauiour, without lightne&s;&s;e, &s;tedfa&s;te in louing, yet not la&s;ciuious, con&s;tant in religion, not &s;uper|&s;titious, braue in attire, yet are not proude.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Simonides,</HI> countrey, lawes, men, women of all &s;orts are thus good by nature, and of this behauiour through wi&s;e go|uernement: now &s;eeing al the&s;e perfections do thus concurre in one, of what exqui&s;itene&s;&s;e &s;houlde the prince be, who&s;e &s;ub|iectes are &s;o perfect.</P>
<P>Truely the Engli&s;he regiment (to eche mans admiration <HI>Simonides</HI>) at this day is &s;o gouerned, as neither <HI>Salomon</HI> in <HI>Iurie</HI> for iu&s;tice, nor <HI>Alfon&s;us</HI> of <HI>Aragon,</HI> for affabilitie, nor <HI>&V;espa&s;ian</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> for correction, are to bee compared to hir that wildeth the kingly &s;cepter there, who being a virgin, and making her vertue an&s;wearable to hir renowmed fathers vic|tories, &s;he hath as much to glory in her pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, as he in his con|que&s;ts: &s;prung &s;he is out of two the renowmed hou&s;es of <HI>Lan|caster</HI> and <HI>Yorke,,</HI> in who&s;e birth (as it &s;eemeth) the cruel mu|tinies forepa&s;t (by rea&s;on of affectation of dignitie) betweene tho&s;e noble families, is euen determined.</P>
<P>She, as report runneth, the&s;e xxv. yeares hath &s;o gouerned her dominions, as neyther con&s;piracie coulde either e&s;cape the circum&s;pection of the gouerner, nor mercie bee pretermitted, if &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion were preferred: This ble&s;&s;ed Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> hath now dominion ouer this bountifull Ilande, who&s;e

<P>Truth it is, <HI>Elizabeths</HI> mantion is an <HI>Academie,</HI> no court where men are &s;o eloquent, women &s;o prudent, al &s;o continent.</P>
<P>There is not the pompe of <HI>Seleucus,</HI> yet is the &s;tate magni|cent, there is not the traine of <HI>Darius,</HI> yet &s;uche are they there, as be gallant: the end is, the Engli&s;h court excelleth all prin|ces palaces for vertues, and matcheth them for vn&s;tained glo|rie, for the practi&s;e of morall precepts what countrie &s;o fortu-tunate, as equitie ruleth at home, &s;o iniuries are not preferred abroade: yea, but looke into one yeares action there, and it wil folow, that what&s;oeuer <HI>Licurgus</HI> left here in paper, thou maie&s;t beholde there in practi&s;e.</P>

<P>Truely aun&s;wered <HI>Phile&s;ius</HI> (for &s;o the Philo&s;ophers name was called) I am &s;ilent more then I would be (good &s;ir) in that perhappes &s;ome here (as the mo&s;t parte of the world) di&s;daine Artes, accomptyng the profe&s;&s;ors thereof to be either fooli&s;he or franticke.

<P>What other mens di&s;po&s;itions are I knowe not (quoth <HI>Si|monides</HI>) but for my &s;elfe, I not onely delight in Science, but al&s;o de&s;ire to knowe it, plea&s;e it you therefore (the rather to a|bridge our trauaile) to varie on &s;ome propo&s;ition, whereby ei|ther &s;ome hidden &s;ecretes of Nature maie be opened, or &s;ome cele&s;tiall working of the &s;uperiour heauens in the&s;e inferiour creatures may be denotated.</P>
<P><HI>Phile&s;ius,</HI> as willing to performe as <HI>Simonides</HI> to require, &s;aide thus: Gentle &s;ir, my pre&s;ent mu&s;ing at this time, is not to be included in fewe tearmes, neither may a rea&s;onable vo|lume comprehend my imaginations, for why, the &s;oule pa&s;&s;eth through more in a moment, than in many yeares may be effe|ctually &s;et downe.</P>
<P>Whilome I was comparing the worlde, which is &s;pherical and rounde (which of all proportions is the be&s;te) nexte of the gouernement of &s;o myraculous a firmament: thirdly, of the o|peration the &s;uperior powers haue in the&s;e inferiour &s;ubiectes: fourthly, what affinitie may be betweene Arte and Nature: fiftly, howe Arte came fir&s;t to light, and was continued by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Al the&s;e propo&s;itions haue I compared in thought, and now
<PB REF="61"> orderly will I &s;peake of them for your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>For the worlde (accordyng to the forme) what is more excel|lent, who&s;e orderly reuolutions, di&s;tingui&s;hing tymes, and pre|fixing euentes to euery ca&s;ualtie, giue occa&s;ion (to a con&s;iderat iudgement) to wonder at the motion, and reuerence the mo|uer: the beautie whereof is &s;uche, as in old time it hath not one|ly been diefied for the glorie it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but al&s;o accompted of by &s;ome of no &s;mall iudgement in Philo&s;ophie for a GOD: which rea&s;on contemned of tho&s;e of &s;ome iudgement in that it was created, cau&s;eth that more honour is atributed to y^e work|mai&s;ter then the worke.</P>
<P>But for the opinion of the Philo&s;ophers touchyng this &s;ub|iect, truely wee of late iudgement, and growne more nerer to the knowledge of God, reproue all for pa&s;&s;ed po&s;itions as fri|uelous, and confirme with <HI>Pithagoras,</HI> that God onely is wi&s;e: Men but louers of wi&s;edome.</P>
<P>But that wee maie mea&s;ure former imaginations of Phi|lo&s;ophers, with our latter experiences in this cau&s;e, let vs con|&s;ider what our Aunce&s;ters haue imagined, both of the creation of the Worlde, and the beginnyng of the Creature.</P>
<P><HI>Thales Mile&s;ius,</HI> one of the wi&s;emen of <HI>Greece,</HI> beginnyng to looke into the generation of all thynges. For the &s;oule he i|magined it immortall, for the world he concluded it to haue his beginnyng by water.</P>
<P><HI>Anaxagoras</HI> tru&s;tyng to his owne opinion fabled thus, that the Sunne was compo&s;ed of bright Iron, that the Heauens were of &s;tone wonderfully knit together lea&s;t thei &s;hould fall.</P>
<P><HI>Euripides</HI> his &s;choler, he faines that the Moone had vallei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> and mountaines in her, and that the minde was the beginning of all motion: concludyng, that all creatures had their creation of Water, Fire, and Earth: wherevnto had hee added the other Eliment of Ayre, I thinke it could neither haue been di&s;&s;onant from rea&s;on, nor repugnaunt to true Philo&s;ophie.</P>
<P>For the creation of the Yearth, <HI>Archelaus</HI> will haue it of liquide water inflamed by the heate of fire, and by re&s;olution turned into du&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Heraclitus,</HI> he thinkes all thynges to haue their originall
<PB REF="61"> of fire, concluding with <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that the generation of one thing is the corruption of an other.</P>
<P><HI>Democritus</HI> and <HI>Leucippus</HI> with the re&s;idue of their cohe|rents, imagining &s;omewhat, yet concluding nothing, they re|ferre the originall of the world to a litle nothing, and making vp a &s;omething of this <HI>Chaos,</HI> conclude it to be &s;ubiect to cor|ruption, wherein they harped on a trueth in their errour, con|firming the vanitie of our <HI>Metaphisickes,</HI> who wading pa&s;te their reatch, conclude &s;omewhat, they knowe not what.</P>
<P>In the&s;e opinions our old philo&s;ophers being conuer&s;ant, the farther they looked into the beginning of all thinges, the more they lo&s;te them &s;elues: &s;o that one of them a mo&s;te profounde clearke called <HI>Simonides,</HI> de&s;ired by <HI>Hiero,</HI> the ty|rant to inquire what God was, and demaunding but one dayes re&s;pite, was in his deepe&s;t imaginations &s;o confounded, that &s;eeing the farther he &s;ought the more he failed, he was in|forced to cea&s;e the attempt, and &s;ubiect his opinion to the in|&s;crutable e&s;&s;ence of the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>In leauing therfore the&s;e opinions of philo&s;ophers to their Mai&s;ters, we mu&s;t conclude, that the worlde of nothing was made wonderfull, fini&s;hed in a triuall dignitie which is mo&s;te ab&s;olute, for though in &s;ixe dayes work the whole Ma&s;&s;e was fini&s;hed, yet in three per&s;ons the fabricature was compo&s;ed, and the fabricated redeemed: &s;o that in vnequall numbers an vnexplicable wonder was wrought, when as by the omnipo|tencie of triuall dignitie the worlde was made, man created, man &s;anctified, and man redeemed, by the operation of three per&s;ons in one godhead.</P>
<P>Some philo&s;ophers (and not vnaptly) by &s;erious in&s;ight in this beautifull firmament haue di&s;tingui&s;hed places, apoin|ting fir&s;t a place of re&s;idence to the Maie&s;tie, whych is they &s;ay <HI>Celum Emperium,</HI> next place they <HI>Cristalinum,</HI> the heauen of Cry&s;tall: nexte in &s;eauen circular motions di&s;tingui&s;he they the planets, appointyng <HI>Saturne</HI> for the fir&s;t, and &s;o by di&s;cent to <HI>Luna,</HI> in the&s;e vnperfect numbers, and circular motions, placing al the beautie of the heauens, and the glorie of the fir|mament.</P>

<P><HI>Plato</HI> in his booke of common wealth, will needes make a common wealth of diuelles in the &s;kies: thus ech hath his er|rour, and euerie one a &s;euerall fanta&s;ie, but &s;ince we certaine|ly knowe how the Worlde was made, and by the beholding of the &s;ame, wonder at the workemai&s;ter, &s;ince we &s;ee the im|perfection of our Philo&s;ophers, that woulde inclo&s;e the diui|nitie wythin limites, let vs nowe wade further, and con&s;ider of the operation of the cele&s;tiall bodies in our terre&s;tiall &s;ub|iects: and herein the vanitie of many are to be wondred at, at|tributing many things to de&s;tinie &amp; fortune, whereas nothing pa&s;&s;eth without the prouidence of the highe&s;t: but for the wor|king of the higher powers: there is &s;ome &s;imilitude in this, that according to the operation of the planet, the creature is di&s;po&s;ed, and if oppo&s;itions fal contrarious in the heauens, the contrarietie takes effect here on earth: for in truth, man is that table, wherein is included al the &s;ecretes of nature, and &s;o are his members di&s;po&s;ed by prouidence, that if by all circum|&s;pection he can conceiue his owne con&s;titution: neither can the operation of the planets be hiden from him, nor the nouel|ties of the earth pa&s;&s;e his vnder&s;ta~ding, in the the whole ma&s;&s;e of nature, neither is hidden Arte concluded &s;o &s;ecrete, that is not included in man, neither any effect in things without life, that hath not relation to the liuely &s;ub&s;tance, according as the heauens are round, &s;o is mans head &s;phericall, as the vnder&s;ta~|ding and intellectiue parte, hath congruence wyth the higher heauens, in which rea&s;on as in in&s;crutable power di&s;po&s;eth al things, and ruleth al things, the &s;ences which are the orgaines whereby rea&s;on worketh, though in number they differ, yet in effect they varie not, mini&s;tring with equal compa&s;&s;e to euery member, at the &s;pheres wyth one <HI>Sumphonia</HI> inuiron the cen|ter.</P>
<P>But to pa&s;&s;e from generalities to particulars, we conclude a <HI>Joui&s;t</HI> to be liberall minded, bounteous, faire borne to honors: a <HI>Marti&s;t</HI> quarrel&s;ome, red haired, au&s;ter lookte, bloudie min|ded, incon&s;tant: a <HI>Mercuriali&s;t</HI> a lyar, a theefe, borne elo|quent, &s;ubtil, and &s;uch like: a <HI>Saturni&s;t,</HI> melancholy, of deepe in&s;ight, &s;tedfa&s;t to per&s;euer, commonly wi&s;e, concluding ac|cording
<PB REF="62"> to the con&s;titution wyth <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that melancholie men are mo&s;te wittie, and in like &s;orte of all the planets.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ee wee a certaine hidden working, and agreement pa&s;&s;ing our reatch, which fleightly we may imagine of but in|wardely we cannot comprehend, wherein we mu&s;t condemne the&s;e vaine heades, who clyming too high beyond their reach, confound them &s;elues in their owne deeming, taking vppon them to knowe other mens fortunes, when they bee ignorant of their owne mi&s;happes. Such &s;kie ge&s;&s;ers haue we now|adayes, that can &s;ee <HI>Jupiter</HI> in his a&s;cendant, and cannot know them &s;elues till they come to the di&s;cendant. But ouer&s;lip|ping the&s;e, I mu&s;e with what fate it falleth out, that in nota|ble and rare ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing, we haue &s;ome foreknowlege of good or bad.</P>
<P>A Comet pretended the birth of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> a Comet pre|figured the de&s;truction of <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> a vniuer&s;al darkene&s;&s;e co|uered the face of the earth, at &s;uch time as our &s;auiour was crucified: at the creation of <HI>Eugenius</HI> the third of that name, fire from heauen deuoured Church &s;teeples in <HI>Rome: Romu|lus</HI> the founder of that ancient citie, was deuoured by fire from heauen.</P>
<P>So that we &s;ee both the heauens worke toward the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the creature, and manace toward the di&s;&s;olution of the creature, and yet but as in&s;truments of their diuine gouer|nour, who by the mi&s;teries of his glorie, prefigureth his fu|ture power.</P>
<P>But leauing this, let vs come to the affinitie betweene Art and Nature, where we are to con&s;ider with the Philo&s;ophers what Nature is: <HI>Tullie</HI> in his <HI>Offices,</HI> hath this &s;aying: <HI>If wee folow nature as guyde we &s;hall neuer erre,</HI> e&s;teeming nature for a God, by whome our chiefe&s;t good fortunes happe.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotles</HI> interpreters diuide nature into two formes, cal|ling the one <HI>Natura Naturans,</HI> and the other <HI>Natura Natu|rata,</HI> that nature that naturateth, is that which <HI>Tullie</HI> accoun|teth for a God: that nature that is naturated, is man.</P>
<P>If Arte be compared to that whych perfiteth all things, it &s;hould &s;triue wyth his founder, but compared wyth his equal,
<PB REF="63"> it perfiteth it, &s;o that Nature is it which pre&s;e~teth the &s;ubiect, Art, it whych perfecteth the &s;ubiect: for many naturally are borne wyth inclinations both to good and bad, Art &s;earching narrowly into the &s;ecrets of al things, confiyrmeth according to the di&s;po&s;ition, eyther clean&s;ing that whych was corrupt, or confounding the euill di&s;po&s;ed in their owne enormitie.</P>
<P>The inclination of &s;ome by nature is to be la&s;ciuious, the correction of the naturall errour by Arte, is to be continent: &s;ome by nature are borne cowardes, the &s;ame by Art are made con&s;tant.</P>
<P><HI>Zopirus</HI> by exterior &s;ignes, adiudged <HI>Socrates</HI> to be wanton and vayne headed, who, though hee confe&s;&s;ed hys naturall in|firmitie, yet thus he di&s;anulled the former propo&s;ition, <HI>E&s;&s;em ita &s;i me philo&s;ophia non correxi&s;&s;et,</HI> I had beene &s;o, had not phi|lo&s;ophie mended me.</P>
<P>But as Arte profiteth Nature in &s;ome things, &s;o Nature excelleth Arte in many thyngs, and yet haue the&s;e two &s;o &s;tri|ued together, that in <HI>Protogenes</HI> table were as fayre grapes in colours, as in Natures gardens, they were in &s;ub&s;taunce: for Nature indeede not onely affecteth the &s;ight, but al&s;o the &s;en&s;es, where Art in &s;ettyng out of colours pre&s;enteth a &s;hape wythout a &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>But &s;o are the&s;e two knitte together, that if Nature alowe no fenell, Arte can make no fire, if Nature be&s;towe no cou|lours, we can haue no paynting, and hee that will &s;tryue to make an A&s;&s;e eloquent, wil, <HI>inuita Minerua,</HI> worke great won|ders, and yet a Crowe could cry <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> although Nature allo|wed her no limites.</P>
<P>Betwixt both Nature and Arte then, let vs put an <HI>interme|dium,</HI> whiche is V&s;e: Nature fir&s;t frameth, Arte teacheth, V&s;e maketh perfect.</P>
<P>Arte was &s;ought out fir&s;t by naturall man, and Arte at fir&s;t confirmed naturall man, yet was there a framer of the one and an in&s;pirer of the other.</P>
<P>Some are borne eloquent, yet Art confirmeth them in their eloquence. Some valiau~t, yet Art compa&s;&s;eth their exploites. What &s;ecrete &s;oeuer Art founde out Nature mini&s;treth it, and
<PB REF="63"> what &s;oeuer Nature hath in her bowelles included, Art hath &s;ought it out.</P>
<P>So that in &s;triuyng to exceede, thei &s;o agree in confirming, that in a learned man it is hard to &s;aie, whether Nature or Art preuaile or profite mo&s;t. But for that Nature was before Art, we will in this preferre her: yet if Art and Wi&s;edome be <HI>Re|latiua,</HI> I feare me Nature mu&s;t loo&s;e the &s;tirropes, and Art &s;et in the &s;addle.</P>
<P>But as touchyng our la&s;t propo&s;ition of the inuention and continuation of Artes, truth it is that the opinions of the Phi|lo&s;ophers are ambiguous in the&s;e pointes: Notwith&s;tandyng, accordyng to my remembraunce, I will breefly pa&s;&s;e through &s;o many as on this &s;odaine my memorie will afforde me, tou|chyng that in a Letter for breuitie whiche els would a&s;ke a vo|lume.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t foundation of Letters is attributed by &s;ome to <HI>Mercury,</HI> by other &s;ome to <HI>Cadmas,</HI> other &s;ome <HI>Palamedes,</HI> who by the criyng of Cranes added fower letters to the Cro&s;|rowe: &s;ome to <HI>Simonides Melicus,</HI> other to <HI>Anticlides</HI> of <HI>Ae|gipt,</HI> but tho&s;e of latter memorie as <HI>Crinitus</HI> reporte, that in a certaine Library this Monument was left for memorie.</P>

<P>Thus Artes had their originall by diligent inue&s;tigation of the in&s;ight into Nature, and are continued vnto the&s;e ty|mes, wherein we finde that as the age chaungeth, &s;o the fa&s;hion altereth, and that Nature and Arte are at &s;uche an atonement, that what &s;o, either in the center of the earth may be found out to worke vpon &s;hall be mini&s;tred: and what &s;o, either memorie maie alowe Art &s;hall perfect: and what is ob&s;cured by tyme, &s;hall be made newe beyng againe renued.</P>

<P>To apply pray&s;e to tho&s;e that alow it not, is to mini&s;ter water to increa&s;e flame, I had rather be in deede, than to bee pray&s;ed in word, but let vs &s;lip ouer the&s;e vnnece&s;&s;arie prai&s;es, and to morrowe we wil fall to &s;ome other &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>They both beyng agreede, betooke them &s;elues to their ca|bins, where I leaue them to their re&s;t, til on the morrow at the Sunne, <HI>Philesius</HI> not accu&s;tomed to &s;leepe exce&s;&s;iuely tooke the hatches, and calling <HI>Simonides</HI> vp, whome he founde fa&s;te a &s;leepe, hee merily in this &s;ort ie&s;ted with hym.</P>

<P>Herein I agr&eacute;e with you (&s;aied <HI>Phile&s;ius</HI>) but the&s;e are in an other kinde then tho&s;e Dreames we talke of: for although thei maie borowe the name of a Dreame, yet in nature they are re|uelations: For in Dreames there are di&s;tinctions bothe aloted by the Poetes, and alowed by the Philo&s;ophers, attributyng one to men, the other to bea&s;tes: for the phanta&s;ie, it worketh on in&s;en&s;ible thynges, and in dreamyng, not onely by the power of the highe&s;t a certaine inwarde knowledge of the immortali|tie of the &s;oule is gathered, but al&s;o certaine forewarninges ei|ther of good or ill are prefigured. For &s;uche Dreames as haue their originall only of the di&s;po&s;ition of phanta&s;ie, and the com|plexion and operation of humours, they as incident to bruite bea&s;tes neede little di&s;cour&s;e.

<P><HI>Cirill</HI> reporteth this dreame to haue fortuned to hym &s;elfe, beyng in his bed, and after he had fini&s;hed his prayers, that hee was fallen a&s;leepe, it &s;eemed vnto him, that he felt an vnmea|&s;urable and horrible &s;tench, whych the &s;en&s;e not admittyng, at la&s;t, the dead bodie of his owne kin&s;man called <HI>Rufus</HI> appea|red vnto hym loaden and chained with greate iron &s;hackles, vomityng out of his mouth, fierie flames, and &s;endyng from out all partes of his bodie innumerable &s;parkles, and tokens of the inwarde fire that was kindled wythin his brea&s;t, whome thus beholdyng wyth intollerable feare and compa&s;&s;ion of minde, he at la&s;te with tremblyng voice as mini&s;ter of hys feareful heart, demaunded of hym thus: O <HI>Rufus,</HI> how falleth it out that thou liuyng as thou didde&s;t in mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed behaui|our accompted of for the integritie of thy life of all men, and &s;houlde&s;t bee thus tormented.</P>
<P>Alas <HI>Cirillus</HI> aun&s;wered <HI>Rufus,</HI> thou art deceiued, for the&s;e plagues are laied vppon mee onely for the loo&s;ne&s;&s;e of my life, for my leude liuyng, my Dieyng and vnlawfull Ga|myng, hath brought me to bee puni&s;hed with &s;o many horrible plagues.</P>

<P>And for that I haue priuate &s;tudies to applie, I am forced to end abruptly, wherevpon, leauyng you to your plea&s;ures good Gentleman) I take my leaue, and thus with a Philo&s;o|phicall becke <HI>Phile&s;ius</HI> departed to his Cabbin, and <HI>Simonides</HI> continued his mu&s;ing of the accidentes forepa&s;t, and wonde|ryng at the effectes of learnyng, he brake into the&s;e tearmes.</P>

<P>It &s;eemeth courteous Gentleman, that you haue certaine ceremonies to performe you &s;it &s;o &s;adly, I am &s;orry among&s;t &s;o many of our poore plea&s;ures, no one of them will wring one &s;mile from your heauie countenaunce.</P>

<P>My thought is the le&s;&s;e &s;ir (&s;aied &s;he) and your welcome the more, but how like you <HI>Englande</HI> &s;aied Madame <HI>Fraunces.</HI></P>

<PB REF="68"> the&s;e attempts, it is not onely a puni&s;hment prefixed to talke again&s;t loue, for commonly the mo&s;te contemners are &s;ubiect to this mi&s;chiefe, that ta&s;tyng their fill of fancie, they not on|lie in nights dreames beholde their dayes &s;orrow, but al&s;o by daye di&s;continu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="4 letters"> their wakyng happine&s;&s;e, whiche makes me now, &s;o to prefixe limites to my arguing, that beyng loath to commit an errour, yet am not I willyng to commende too much, wherevppon, if it plea&s;e you, wee will rea&s;on whether beautie be more commendable in a ba&s;e borne creature, than in hir that is &s;prong of noble parentage: and for that I wil leaue you that which belongeth to your &s;elfe, beyng de&s;cended of ho|nourable parentes: I meane to maintayne this, that the ex|cellencie of beautie is more commendable in hir that is &s;prong by progenie of &s;mall regarde, than in hir that is beautifull and enriched with many titles of honour.</P>
<P>My rea&s;ons be the&s;e, fir&s;t nature is emploid more &s;trange|ly than minde can conceiue, when on thi&s;tles &s;hee grafteth ro|&s;es, or on the hurtfull hemlocke, the hurtle&s;&s;e hearbgrace, in the deformed wombe, a perfect &s;ub&s;tance, when gro&s;e humors, homely feedyng, and di&s;ordered diet, worke both in actiue and pa&s;&s;iue &s;ub&s;tances, if there were not more than a &s;upernatural workyng, we mu&s;te conclude, that the female &s;houlde be &s;ub|iect to manie defaults, and humours eyther abandonyng or defaulting in Nature, the babe &s;houlde be either a mon&s;ter or changelyng in proportion: &s;o that, by howe muche the more the rare effects of Nature are to bee wondred at, by &s;o muche the wonderfull benefites of beautie are to be commended.</P>
<P>And with &s;ome hidden rea&s;on, the powers be&s;tow the&s;e be|nefites on pouertie, that where they haue not mini&s;tred to it in worldly honours, they forget not to recompence in &s;eemely &s;imilitudes: &s;o that it mu&s;te be concluded, that Nature more &s;trangely worketh in vnnoble than in noble, when from &s;o ba&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, &s;o &s;weete a perfection is gathered. So that I feare me, if there were the like cu&s;tome in <HI>England,</HI> as was at <HI>Elida,</HI> that &s;hee that was the beautifulle&s;t, &s;hould bee crowned in re|garde of honour, I doubt not but our ba&s;e borne beautifull, might &s;acrifice a target to <HI>Minerua,</HI> when our braue&s;t courti|ers,
<PB REF="68"> and Ladies of greate&s;t honour, &s;houlde be but mini&s;trs to accompli&s;he the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>And it would &s;o fall out, that the faire maidens of <HI>Tenidos,</HI> &s;hould carrie away the bucklers, when our beautifull damo|&s;ells of <HI>Troy</HI> were to be depriued of their honour they &s;o &s;triue for.</P>
<P>But to make my rea&s;ons more forcible, I mu&s;te inferre this, what &s;o a noble minde beautified wyth all titles of honor de&s;ireth, mu&s;t be concluded to be both rare and wonderful, but the beautie of hir that is borne but of vnnoble pare~ts, hath &s;ub|dued mightie Emperours, and therefore more to be maruailed at.</P>
<P>For you faire damo&s;ells, the abundance of your wealth, the promotions of your fathers, the expectation of worldly plea|&s;ure makes you to be &s;ought after, and to bee &s;ued to, when as they hauyng none of the&s;e po&s;&s;ibilities to preferre them, are as curteou&s;ly intreated as your &s;elues, and more accompted of, than many of you.</P>
<P>It was a lawe among&s;t the Lacedemonians, that who in battell had gained victorie, &s;houlde in the pre&s;ence of the king be crowned with garlands of honor, wherevpon noble Iudge, I mu&s;t now reque&s;t you, that &s;eeing I haue concluded &s;o vn|doubtedly, I may be rewarded wyth honour accordingly.</P>
<P>Mai&s;tre&s;&s;e <HI>Claudia</HI> conceiuyng his conclu&s;ion, chopte him this aun&s;were, who triumphs before the victorie, may &s;ooner carrie a fagot for his penaunce than weare a garlande for his honour. <HI>Stichicus</HI> might &s;triue with <HI>Hercules</HI> in &s;leight matter of plea&s;ure, but if he chalenge the combat, he might haue a cold comfort in his proceedynges.</P>
<P>So <HI>Signior Siluius</HI> it will fare with you, who in matters of plea&s;ure like the Lambe maie plaie with the Lyon, but if you &s;tretche pa&s;t your compa&s;&s;e, you maie happe to haue a clindge for your labour, neither ought you to claime the rewarde of victorie, &s;ince with mo&s;t certaine demon&s;tration I will defend, and with more probabilitie I wil conclude, that beautie in the Noble is more commendable, then in tho&s;e of ob&s;cure name it is prai&s;e worthie. In good &s;ooth tell me <HI>(Signior Siluius)</HI> is not
<PB REF="69"> the Sunne more beautifull in the Firmament, when the ob|&s;curitie of the cloudes defaceth it not, than when it is ouer&s;ha|dowed wyth darkene&s;&s;e: is not the delectable &s;ent of the Ro&s;e more commendable, when it is mixed with his companions in Nature, than ouerpre&s;&s;ed with vn&s;auorie &s;melles, I &s;ee not but that the moone is more faire amid&s;t the glim&s;ing &s;tarres, than amonge&s;t the &s;hrowdes of darkene&s;&s;e, and affects the eie &s;ight with more plea&s;ure, and the trauailer with greater com|forte.</P>
<P>Place beautie in an honourable per&s;onage, and it hath affi|nitie with an honourable minde, which maketh it &s;o much the more to be wondred at: As for the matching beautie in a ba&s;e per&s;onage, it is to put pearles in a &s;wines no&s;trels, to pricke floures in a filthie donghill, or to dre&s;&s;e an A&s;&s;e in a Lyons &s;kinne.</P>
<P>I can bring you many that were noblie borne, that were ex|qui&s;ite in all profe&s;&s;ions, but for them that are ob&s;cure in byrth, neuer founde I anie, neither if I did would I beleeue it.</P>
<P>A beautifull noble woman brought vp in vertuous demea|ner is a pre&s;ident to tho&s;e that folow after, who with emulatio~ will contend to exceede or match hir at the lea&s;t. But when a beautifull in noble &s;hall fortune by wonderfull de&s;tinies to growe to great perfection, what imitation &s;hal wee finde or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion among&s;t the&s;e ob&s;cure maidens.</P>
<P>No <HI>Segnior Siluius.</HI> I conclude, and you mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e, that my rea&s;ons are the &s;tronger, and for that I wil not be tedious, I leaue the re&s;te to the di&s;cretion of the Iudge.</P>
<P>The whole companie alowing this methodicall contenti|on, after &s;ome paw&s;e, were attentiue to heare the &s;econd di&s;|putation, when as <HI>Fauellus</HI> a noble Gentleman, and one well nurtured, turned to <HI>Secr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">bia,</HI> and &s;aide thus:</P>

<PB REF="69"> whether would you alow of the Souldior for your bedfellow, or the Courtier for your hu&s;band?</P>
<P>Truly <HI>Fauellus</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Secrobia</HI>) I alow wel of the Souldior, but I mu&s;t yeelde the pri&s;e to the Courtier.</P>
<P>And I Madame (&s;aide <HI>Fauellus</HI>) wil prooue the Souldiour more worthie to be alowed of, and a more meete man to be be|loued, and this not without rea&s;on: fir&s;te, for per&s;onage mo&s;t commonly he is as perfect as the be&s;te, for bedde plea&s;ures, Idoubte not as actiue as the mo&s;te, in di&s;cour&s;e, as de|lectable, in loue as &s;tedefa&s;t, his affections are not &s;o vari|ous as the Courtiers, for that his life is not &s;o la&s;ciuious, if thine honour be depraued, he wil reuenge it, if thou be &s;ubiect to any imperfection, he will beare with it, for it mu&s;te needes folow, that he who winketh at &s;o many outrages in his Soul+dior, wil not be much incen&s;ed with a womans naturall fragi|litie: their eies are cha&s;te in all places.

<P>A &s;ouldiour perhaps may bee accompted bloudie minded, and therfore not mete for a delicate damo&s;els bed, but in my o|pinion it were better to marrie a man than a meacocke, for the Souldiour offereth no rigour but to his enimie, if hee be di&s;plea&s;ed, it is with &s;uch as enuie the felicitie of his Mi&s;tris: the Courtier perhaps &s;hutes it out in better colours, but the Souldiour hauing no fine phra&s;es to plea&s;e humours, laieth it on with plaine truthe, whiche is the plea of him that in loue wil prooue mo&s;t con&s;tant.</P>
<P>Whereupon I mu&s;t conclude (mi&s;tris <HI>Secrobia</HI>) that either you mu&s;t proue affectionate in your choice, or peruer&s;e in re&s;o|lution, makyng election of the wor&s;er and leauinge the better, and on this conclu&s;ion I refer my &s;elf to iudgment.</P>
<P>And to this conclu&s;ion I &s;hape this aun&s;wer (&s;aied <HI>Secrobia</HI>)
<PB REF="70"> though you haue tied me within limites of election <HI>(Signior Fauellus)</HI> yet I will &s;u&s;&s;pend my re&s;olut iudgment, and for that you &s;hall not thinke by your rea&s;on thus to win the goole, thus much for the courtier.</P>
<P>Who &s;o in all actions mo&s;t fitteth wonens fanta&s;ies. is mo&s;t conuenient to be alowed, but Courtiers are thei that mo&s;t con: ueniently &s;ati&s;fie faire Ladies likynges, and therefore mete&s;t to be had in wedlocke.</P>
<P>For the truth is &s;o, that whereas faire demo&s;eles are deligh|ted with &s;eamline&s;&s;e, mode&s;t plea&s;ure, with like courtly behaui|ours: &s;uch thinges are mo&s;t agreable to their delicate humours, and therefore it cannot bee but that a Courtiour mu&s;t bee ad|mitted who is the onely man for this purpo&s;e to furni&s;h them in that thei looke for.</P>
<P>The Courtiour with &s;eamly par&s;onage, with honourable behauiour, with philed phra&s;es, with &s;weet mu&s;icke, and with twentie amarous deuices will delude the time &s;o pretely, that we Laidies can not imagine them, but to be the onely mini|&s;ters to procure our plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the Soldiour, what re&s;teth there either to be wondreth at or wi&s;hed for that the Courtiour wanteth, in the Courtiour, is there any thing mi&s;&s;yng in whiche he exceedeth not the Sol|diour, the Courtiour is as good a hor&s;eman, as practi&s;ed a man at armes, as valiaunt to defend his mi&s;tris, yea more re&s;olute in beauties cau&s;e, they &s;tand on euery light tearme of honour, not &s;ufferyng the lea&s;t &s;taine to take hould of their gentrie.</P>
<P>The Soldiour is fed withe murthers, delighted in blod&s;hed, the memorie of who&s;e ma&s;&s;akers, would make the memorie of his plea&s;ures mo&s;t looth&s;ome. And <HI>Signior Fauellus,</HI> that con|tenencie whiche you impute to Soldiours, aledging the exam|ple of <HI>Alexander</HI> that would not regarde the beautie of <HI>Darius</HI> wife &amp; daughters, imagiyyng thereby the cha&s;titie of Soldiors myndes, I can not by this excu&s;e your gro&s;e imagination, but doe rather thinke Soldiours to be &s;o betle blinded that thei are not able to di&s;treye the perfection of beautie: or els compo&s;ed of &s;o ba&s;e a &s;ub&s;taunce not to e&s;tem of &s;o rare a benifit, as hath mad the wi&s;e&s;t to &s;toupe.</P>

<P>The Courtiour continueth in one comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e, that is alwaies con&s;tant, redie at a becke for all &s;eruice: the Soldiour when his mi&s;tris &s;hould haue mo&s;t nede of him, is wandryng I knowe not where, and returneth I can not tell when.</P>
<P>The Courtiour pretermitteth not a daie without varietie of delight, lyberall he is in expence, bountifull to her he honour|eth, he re&s;pecteth not either this occa&s;ion of conque&s;t, or that bootie to inriche him, but acountes his chefe&s;t felicitie in the at|tainment of beautie, and to doe faire Ladies &s;eruice, and &s;hould not thei (thinke you) be to vnkynde, that would forget the dili|gence of &s;o louing Gentlemen.</P>
<P>Truely <HI>Fauellus</HI> I mu&s;t conclude my fancie with faire Lai|dies opinions (for I take my &s;elf &s;ometimes to be one of their preuie coun&s;aile) that Soldiours are more fitter for the feilde, then for the feilde bed: more meter for a ma&s;&s;acre, then for a ma|riage: And the Courtiour to be the onely nece&s;&s;arie man, that fitteth to worke a faire Ladies plea&s;ure. If this be not true, I referr me to the iu&s;t determination of this gentleman our iudg.</P>
<P>All the companie laughed hartely at this mery conclu&s;ion, till &s;uch tyme as madame <HI>Eraunces</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed thus.</P>
<P>Sith the matter is &s;orted out thus farr (gentle <HI>Furnelius</HI>) I will now &s;treine curti&s;ie with you and inuert the order, and becau&s;e my memorie is but brittle, I will begin the &s;oner lea&s;t I forget the latter.</P>
<P>Your profe&s;&s;ion (I dout not) is &s;uch good &s;ir, as you which haue practi&s;ed the profit thereof &s;o long, are not now to &s;eeke how to prai&s;e it, whereupon at this pre&s;ent, I meane to argue thus. Whether the Lawyer or the Phi&s;ition be more commen|dable in a &s;tate, I will defend the Lawyer, for you as beeyng a Phi&s;ition by profe&s;&s;ion, you maie the better defend &s;ince you are the more practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;er of the law, if he had naught els to commend hym, the verie name it &s;elf would make it prai&s;e worthy, for by the lawes good di&s;ciplines are pre&s;cribed, the &s;tate gouerned, and all policies to the maintenaunce of peace, both begun, con|tinued and ended.</P>
<P>The Lawyer, knowyng the puni&s;hment of all errours, and
<PB REF="71"> findyng him &s;elf to be a pre&s;ident in all good demeaner, &s;o orde|reth him &s;elf as when he but pa&s;&s;eth the &s;treates as <HI>Cato Cen&s;er</HI> did, all <HI>Rome</HI> refraineth idlene&s;&s;e and becommeth well ocupied, he purgeth the &s;tate of &s;u&s;pitious inconueniences, he pre&s;cribeth in the Commenwealth &s;uch preuentions as that an errour now &s;pronge vp can neither take head nor be contenued, no not in tho&s;e of great countenaunce the profe&s;&s;er of the law hath relati|on to leade him, con&s;cience to direct him, iu&s;tice to coun&s;ell him, honour to reward him. In his life he is vertuous, in his coun|&s;ailes con&s;tant, in his iudgementes vpright, in his pleadynges vncorrupte, in conclu&s;ion, he is the onely nece&s;&s;arie membre in a &s;tate, by whom the Noble are coun&s;ailed, the &s;ubiect kept in awe, and the truth is, that the Common wealth is vnhappie, whereas the Lawyer hath not both preferment by his practi&s;e, and poure to reproue what he mi&s;liketh.</P>
<P>It was a Lawyer (yea and a learned practi&s;er of the &s;cience <HI>Apius Claudius</HI>) who when the whole &s;enate and &s;tate hunge in &s;u&s;&s;pence by the approch of the enimie, not onely coun&s;ailed that whiche was profitable, but al&s;o preferred tho&s;e preceptes which were honourable for his cuntrie: neither yet knew I any regi|ment fortunate, where either the Prince was &s;elf opinionatiue not re&s;pectyng lawe or the &s;ubiect &s;o di&s;&s;olute that he regarded not the Lawyer. As for you Docter <HI>Furnelias,</HI> if your potions be whol&s;ome, thei are as perlions to the Soule as thei are pro|fitable for the bodie, for your pacient beyng once re&s;tored to health, he is made prone to put in practi&s;e euery kynd of inor|mitie: againe, your medicine is commodious but to one perti|culer per&s;on, but where one good <HI>Axiome</HI> pa&s;&s;eth from a Lawyer, it is not a &s;ole plea&s;ure, but in truth it is publiquely commodions</P>
<P>If then, by the dignitie practi&s;e and profit, the law as mo&s;t commendable, the profe&s;&s;er of force mu&s;t not faile of prehe|minence, whom &s;ince I haue concluded for a more nece&s;&s;ary per&s;on, I doubt not but the iudge will determine, that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ate he is mo&s;t profitable.</P>
<P>Here cea&s;ed Ladie <HI>Fraunces</HI> when thus the graue Docter began his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<PB REF="71">
<P>Madam perhappes (as commonly among&s;t Ladies it fal|leth out) your Ladi&s;hipe rather deameth vppon affection then iudgement, whiche makethe you &s;o parcially to thinke of the Lawyer, and &s;o iudicially to condemne the Phi&s;ition, but if a burnyng feeuour as now had handfa&s;t of your bodie, I fere me you would rather &s;acrifice to <HI>A&s;culapius,</HI> then &s;hake handes with <HI>Iu&s;tinian,</HI> per&s;waded by profe &amp; experience in this that a medicine can alay that in the body which moral preceptes ca~ ne|uer a&s;wage, and that the Phi&s;ition in extreamitie of &s;icknes is your Godes good, where nowe in your di&s;cour&s;e he is &s;mally accounted of.</P>
<P>As man is made but of Soule and bodie, &s;o nexte the Soule the health of the bodie is to be pre&s;erued before worldly pelf, and as riche&s;&s;e are but &s;laues to mini&s;ter to the bodies want, &s;o the greate&s;t commendation that may be giuen to a Lawyer is but in iu&s;tice to giue euery one his owne, yet this farre vncomper|able to the Phi&s;ition, that giueth euerie one his health. But admit what you haue &s;aied to be true, that the Lawyer is to be thought worthy the commendation you haue giuen him, yet the Phi&s;ition is he that continueth him his health, and then I doubt not but you will conclude, that the perfiter is more wor|thy then the perfited, and that he that mini&s;treth perfection to the Lawyer, is of more excelencie then the Lawyer. If &s;ick|nes &s;hould take hold on your mo&s;t vpright iu&s;ticer, by whom (as you conclude) the whole &s;tate is releaued by, I praie you then who is &s;ent for, is not the Phi&s;ition &s;ued vnto, then runnes this Ladie for that pre&s;eruatiue, now for that preparatiue, againe for this purgation, and &s;hould not the humour by Phi|&s;icke be expelled, our Lawyer might bid goodnight to his frendes, is it not then true that the Phi&s;ition is to be preferred when he not onely is a good membre in a Commonwealth, but al&s;o continueth in good health the &s;taies and vpholders of the &s;tate. If the memorie be ill, phi&s;icke will recouer it: if the bodie be con&s;umed, a medicine will helpe it: if beautie be de|caied, phi&s;icke will re&s;tore it: and madame, can you find in hart to &s;peake ill of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary members. He that mu&s;t be a Phi&s;i+tion &amp; a mai&s;ter in his &s;cience, mu&s;t be able to &s;earch into the na|ture
<PB REF="72"> of the Heauens, the cour&s;e of the Planetes, the di&s;tintio~ of tymes, the operations of complextions whereas to be a &s;uffici|ent Lawyer requireth no great art, but a di&s;crete iudgment, a good memorie, with a fewe principles, &s;o that the conclu&s;ions of law maie be comprehended in 20 yeares limet, where to be a good Phi&s;ition requireth <HI>Ne&s;tors</HI> yeares.</P>
<P>Yea, madam, for that you &s;hall know the Phi&s;ition is as profitable and as expert in &s;tate as any others, doe but marke this, that in the tyme of <HI>Eugenus</HI> the thirde, at a general coun|&s;aill, a Phi&s;ition interteinynge the whole rablement of pro|found Philo&s;ophers of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and at that &s;ityng, not onely aun|&s;wered them to their depe&s;t opo&s;itions, but al&s;o confounded them in their owne groundes, and not without rea&s;on, where|as he that perfiteth the memoryes of others can bee, without the &s;ame perfection by which he worketh.</P>
<P>Truly faire Ladies if you were examined vppon your con&s;|ciences, how many of you would proue kind pacientes to your Phi&s;itions, and confe&s;&s;e that vnle&s;&s;e our medicines had &s;harp|ly alaied &s;ome humours would haue proued ouer lawle&s;&s;e, nei|ther able to be corrected with a common Lawyers cautions, although in your Ladi&s;hippes opinion, now thei mu&s;t haue the preheminence.</P>
<P>But good madame &s;ince we haue referred all to an arbiter and iudge, I reque&s;t you &s;u&s;pend your iudgement and leaue it to his di&s;cretion, who beyng a &s;traunger and hauing in trauell gathered many experiences, will not faile to conclude accor|dyng to di&s;cretion, and preferre the per&s;on accordyng as his de&s;ertes inable him.</P>
<P>Why &s;aied madam <HI>Fraunces, Signior Simonides,</HI> the whole re&s;teth in you, who to conclude this our nightes di&s;port, are onely to furni&s;h vs of a iudgment touchyng all our doubtes.</P>
<P>And I madame accordyng to the tenuite of my iudgment, will fulfill what you haue inioyned me, although I am bound in the&s;e cau&s;es to &s;ome extreamyties.</P>
<P>Since you <HI>Signior Siluius</HI> confirme a wonder, Mi&s;tris <HI>Claudia</HI> a meruell, beautie as I e&s;teame (faire Ladies) as it was fir&s;t made incomprehen&s;ible by rea&s;on of excelencie, &s;o is
<PB REF="72"> it not be&s;towed but vppon rare per&s;onages: for nature in the fir&s;t compo&s;ition of all creatures, proportioned the beautifull in &s;uch forme, as if <HI>Ethinick</HI> poetes may preuaile to per&s;wade, it not onely bewitcheth the Godes, but al&s;o intangleth the cre|atures, &s;o that where the benifit of beauty is imploied, ther bi|cau&s;e the per&s;on is to be wondered at the powers, by hidden &s;e|cre&s;ie adequat the delight of the one, with the perfection of ho|nour, not vouch&s;afing beautifull brightne&s;&s;e but on the &s;unne, nor faire face but on an honourable per&s;onag, willyng on this to contenue their wonted equalitie, who be&s;tow all graces a|like, not &s;ufferyng beautie to dround honour, nor honour to ex|cede beautie, &s;o that when nature bendeth at my tyme to the ba&s;er, it is but to &s;hew that &s;he can of infamous make noble, and of ba&s;e borne beautiful yet notwith&s;tanding, as the Pain|ter generally be&s;towith all his be&s;t coullers on the &s;weete&s;t &s;i|mulytudes, &s;o nature mo&s;t commonly be&s;toweth her rare&s;t per+fections on the roialle&s;t &s;ub&s;taunce, immitatynge herein the cour&s;e of the world, where there is haboundaunce, there more &s;hall be be&s;towed, and he that is pre&s;&s;ed with penurie, mu&s;t &s;til be contented to bide the penaunce.</P>
<P>So that <HI>Signior Siluius,</HI> herein I mu&s;t depriue you of that you wi&s;he for, in that you commende that whiche onely is but probably true, where this Gentlewoman hauyng experience in the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, hath iudicially concluded, leauyng me a bad &s;cipher to fini&s;he vp her &s;entence.</P>
<P>But for you <HI>Signior Fauellus,</HI> who hath entered into the na|ture of deuine creatures, bindyng womens likynges within limites, I mu&s;t v&s;e you and your re&s;olutions as the <HI>Anthro|pophagie</HI> v&s;e their enemies, who fat them then mo&s;t exce&s;&s;iuely, when thei entende to murther them cruelly, &s;o alowyng you a little &s;cope to confirme the plau&s;ibilitie of your witte, I mu&s;t with the &s;ame rea&s;ons di&s;&s;wade by which you confirme, &s;o bea|tyng you with your owne rodde, and mai&s;teryng you in your owne conclu&s;ions, Mi&s;tris <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">robia</HI> mu&s;t haue the day and you the di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>You growe in commendation of Soldiours, in whom what note you but con&s;tauncie (and that is a vertue) in whom what
<PB REF="73"> alowe you but valewe, (and that placed as it ought to bee is a black &s;wane) yet who fitteth the faire Cambrick with a black &s;taine, and the &s;weete Amber with the rancke Mandrake, &s;hall find he hath but acquainted an A&s;&s;e with eloquence, &amp; a Plow man with Philo&s;ophie.</P>
<P>Are Soldiours con&s;taunt <HI>(Fauellus)</HI> it is then in vncon&s;tan|cie? Are Soldiours valiaunt <HI>(Fauellus)</HI> it is then in extreami|ties, and I thinke who neuer doeth well before he be vrged, his well doyng is not prai&s;e worthie, for where the action is not freely enterpri&s;ed, though the &s;ucce&s;&s;e be neuer &s;o fortunate, the vnwillyng attempt concludes an vnworthie exigent.</P>
<P>It is a Soldiour that you would make a Ladies mai&s;ter, and faire Damo&s;elles vouch&s;afe not to accept &s;o ba&s;e fellowes to bee their &s;eruauntes, &s;o then in myne opinion wee mu&s;t con|clude, that he that will prefixe raines to womens fanta&s;ies, and would pre&s;cribe them limites to keepe them within compa&s;&s;e, mu&s;t both bid the repul&s;e of his vniu&s;t compari&s;on, and be di&s;|placed of Iudgement when he &s;eekes to conclude that whiche is infinite.</P>
<P>A Courtier is a collop of plea&s;ure, whiche was fir&s;t bred to feede Ladies with varietie, and to &s;ucke the Marrowe of the youth, and to determine the plea&s;ures of their age.</P>
<P>A Soldiour is no doubt of it re&s;erued to an ende, yet that exigent &s;o &s;eque&s;ters them from any libertie of likyng, that he who but carries the name for his after commoditie, mu&s;t bee glad of the repul&s;e for his vniu&s;t title.</P>
<P>So that now <HI>Fauellus,</HI> I mu&s;t conclude in beauties cau&s;e, as vniu&s;t tyrauntes in their owne ouerweanyng, <HI>Stat pro ra|tione voluntas,</HI> Beauties alowance &s;tandes for rea&s;on: And if I haue not concluded well faire Ladies be you Iudge.</P>
<P>But Madem <HI>Frunces,</HI> as you inuented the order, &s;o now mu&s;t I alter my &s;entence, and as your conclu&s;ions were mo&s;t &s;erious. &s;o will I more &s;euerely conclude of your cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>You as naturally inclined to maintain a Commonwealth (in that you are a nece&s;&s;ary membre to multiplie) giue phe|minence to the law maker, and not without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he contenueth and increa&s;eth peace, pre&s;cribeth and
<PB REF="73"> performeth good lawes, ye &s;o ordereth all thinges, that no thinges can be lawle&s;&s;e that is within his reche, nor any thing vnlookt to where he maie haue libertie. But Docter <HI>Furneli|us,</HI> who can de&s;cant on all natures, in colouryng the errours of the Lawyer, ciphereth out his owne perfections, he will not tell how the Lawyer is a peny Father, how a maintainer of contencions, how like to <HI>Ae&s;opes</HI> Rite, who while the mou&s;e and the Froge &s;troue togither for &s;uprimecie in the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;he, he denoured them both, and made the &s;oure of their contention the &s;wet of his praie,</P>
<P>But he wi&s;ely reputes him prai&s;e, by that meanes to im|ploie the excellency of his practi&s;e, for (&s;aieth he) if the Law|yer bee commodious then he that contenueth this commodity mu&s;t of force be accounted more profitable.</P>
<P>But if Doctor <HI>Furnelius,</HI> &s;hould remember, that by the o|peration of his potions, the euil are enabled to more vnlawful practi&s;es, and the Lawier being by him recouered, is lefte to folow his wonted exerci&s;e, to maintaine &s;trife and contention in a &s;tate, for the verie brables and quarrel&s;ome debates that are had among&s;t fooles, is the onelie credite, reputation, and maintenance of the Lawyer: And therfore (Madame <HI>Fraun|ces,</HI> not to di&s;&s;emble with you, who hath &s;aid &s;o well for them, and not to flatter Mai&s;ter Doctor, who hath aleadged &s;o much in his owne behalfe, I mu&s;t conclude the Phi&s;ition to bee the mo&s;t profitable member in a common wealth, for that he many times with his medicines killeth the Lawier, who, while hee liued in health, cou&s;ins the poore comminaltie of their coine, with his crafte.</P>
<P>So now my faire Ladies, and good Gentlemen the debate may cea&s;e: and if it &s;hall plea&s;e you to &s;leepe vpon my verdite, if to morrow you &s;hall not like it, you may reuer&s;e it with a writ of errour, &s;o you put in good &s;ureties: And we will not trouble the Iudge wyth common baile (&s;aide Madam <HI>Fraun|ces</HI>) in &s;o &s;erious a cau&s;e: yea but Madame (&s;aid <HI>Simonides</HI>) I mu&s;t put you to your booke othe before I admitte you: As for that conclu&s;ion (&s;aid Ladie <HI>Fraunccs</HI>) &s;ince it lieth on your curte&s;ie to e&s;teeme, I doubt not but you will forbeare if you

<P>He thus in a &s;trange &s;oile, and among&s;t &s;trange people, was troubled with as &s;trange imaginations, fir&s;t with the felicitie of the Ilande, next of the opulencie of the inhabitants, then of the bountie of their repa&s;t, thinking in him&s;elfe, that <HI>Euphues</HI> prai&s;e might wel per&s;wade &s;o farre, and that <HI>England</HI> was on|lie fortunate, beyng &s;o fruitful in all ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>And &s;leepyng on the&s;e imaginations, on the morrowe at conuenient time, he was conducted by <HI>Philautus</HI> vnto the Engli&s;h court, where he not onelie receiued a freendly <HI>Bein &V;enu</HI> of <HI>Surius,</HI> but al&s;o a curteous &s;alutation of Madam <HI>Ca|milla.</HI></P>
<P>And here it were a wonder to write, how his imaginations wrought, comparyng <HI>Euphues</HI> reports, with his own proofes, there &s;awe he as great brauerie as might be, as much beauty as was requi&s;ite, ech &s;ubiect &s;o &s;umptuous, that raui&s;hed with the imagination of the inferiour, he beganne euen then to me|ditate what might be in the &s;uperior, but when the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Elizabeth</HI> pre&s;ented hir &s;elfe, in whom findyng au&s;tere &s;eeme|line&s;&s;e befittyng a Prince&s;&s;e, curteous affabilitie to entertaine freends, incomparable beautie to allure an enimie: admirable cha&s;titie again&s;t all a&s;&s;aultes of fancies, con&s;tant re&s;olutions in wortthy attemptes, ine&s;timable dowers of learnyng with|out anie blemi&s;h of arrogancie: he concluded as the Paynter did of <HI>&V;enus</HI> proportion, that &s;ince the&s;e verie <HI>Principia</HI> of hir vertues were vn&s;peakeable, it were not po&s;&s;ible to cyphre out the true &s;imilitudes of hir perfections, nor re&s;emble that by &s;hadowes, which relied vpon a more than heauenly con&s;tel|lation.</P>
<P>Thus fared it with <HI>Simonides</HI> at that in&s;tant, as that alto|gither confounded in his imaginations, he here &s;et vp his re&s;t confirming, that if <HI>England</HI> were as happie for &s;ubiectes as it

<P>Herevpon he po&s;ted ouer his wanderpng eies to more ba|&s;er, yet &s;eemely obiectes, and takyng the viewe of the beauti|full Ladies in Courte, in whome beholdyng &s;uch &s;trange and &s;undrie fa&s;hions, &s;uch imitating of all exce&s;&s;e, that was v&s;ed through <HI>Europe,</HI> he concluded in his imagination, that either the Ladies bare the&s;e patternes in &s;corne of the abu&s;e, or loath to yeelde to anie countrie in curio&s;itie, vouch&s;afed the fa&s;hion though they admitted not the vice.</P>
<P>When he looked into the whole &s;tate of Gentlemen, and finding &s;ome of the yonger &s;orte to be more than halfe effemi|nate, light in attire, imitating &s;uch newfangles, as are vn|&s;eamly for men. He varied in his opinion thus much, that ei|ther <HI>Euphues</HI> &s;ought to confirme him by contraries, or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> brauery was <HI>Napolitan</HI> exce&s;&s;e, and that both <HI>Napolitan</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;he</HI> ryot was to be lamented, not commended.</P>
<P>This befell on <HI>Simonides</HI> in the oueruewe of the <HI>Engli&s;he</HI> Court, and thus fared it in his fanta&s;ies, &s;o that in him &s;elf he began to conclude an opinion, when at the very in&s;tant noble <HI>Su|rius</HI> with <HI>Madamo&s;illa Camilla,</HI> with <HI>Philautus</HI> in the compa|ny, all at one in&s;tante came vnto him, conductyng him vnto their mantion hou&s;e, where <HI>Simonides</HI> beheld &s;uch new brauery as wrought in his minde a new wonder.: The mu&s;icke was &s;o delicate, the meate &s;o daintie, the entertainment &s;o hartie, the &s;erui&s;e &s;o &s;tatly, the &s;eruitours &s;o &s;eamly, to conclude euery thing was &s;o &s;umptious, as the glory of the Spani&s;h Court &s;ea|med propo&s;terous in compari&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Camilla</HI> willing to delight the &s;traunger with as great vari|etie as &s;he could, leauing the re&s;t of the companie, betooke her &s;elf to entertaine him, began in the&s;e tearmes to commence her di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Curtious Gentleman, it &s;eemeth me that either you are fed with di&s;dain, or led with &s;ome mi&s;like, your behauiour is &s;o ma|lancholike, and your demeanour &s;o mi&s;content: if ought be here
<PB REF="75"> therefore that mi&s;likes you, forbid it, if any thing that myght delight you command, and it &s;hall be had.</P>
<P>Madam &s;aied <HI>Simonides,</HI> if wonder bread malencholie, I confe&s;&s;e my &s;elf &s;ubiect to the humour, the plea&s;ures here bee &s;o infinit, as one drowneth an other, &amp; al haue relation to one beau|tie on whiche thei attend, whiche among&s;t all the delightes that wait on your Court, on myne Honour mo&s;t contenteth mee.</P>
<P>And if beautie plea&s;e your affectes &s;o much (&s;aied <HI>Camilla</HI>) truely this hou&s;e is vnfortunate onely in that plea&s;ure, notwith|&s;tandyng, &s;uch louely browne as our Courtiours are aco&s;tomd to, you maie be aquainted with: and your Ladie&s;hip maie doe me great fauour in this (&s;aied <HI>Simonides</HI>) wherevpon the La|die callyng out three of the mo&s;t beautiefull Damo&s;eles of her traine, began to di&s;cour&s;e againe thus with <HI>Simonides.</HI></P>
<P>Since (noble Spaniard) it is beautie that delighteth you, I haue brought you three patturns to imploye your cunnyng on, whiche &s;hall atend both on your cup and trencher, and &s;up|plie &s;uch &s;imple di&s;cour&s;e as their yong heades will afford them</P>
<P>And I madame (aun&s;wered <HI>Simonides</HI>) gratiou&s;ly accept your honourable curti&s;ie and their &s;inguler fauour: wherevpon &s;treinyng ech of them gentely by the hand he began to di&s;cour&s;e with them thus.</P>
<P>Faire Ladies if all perfection of your myndes, be aun&s;wer|able to the habitudes of your bodies, I feare me that neither any climat in <HI>Europe,</HI> can afford more beautifull nor ouerlooke more wi&s;e. Mi&s;tris <HI>Elida,</HI> a Gentlewoman of very quicke capacitie, and incomparable beautie, aun&s;wered him thus.</P>
<P>Gentleman, &s;ince &s;o preiudicially you condemne all <HI>Eur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">pe,</HI> and admit of three &s;illy offalles of beautie, leauyng a whole <HI>Ca|tologe</HI> of Courtiers vnlookt, yet &s;eemeth either you count vs mete &s;ubiectes to worke vppon, &s;ince our imperfections be &s;o many, and the onely browne which furthereth your whit in your &s;ecret imagenation: which if it be &s;o, you maie if it plea&s;e you go forward in your purpo&s;e, and we &s;illy &s;iphers will &s;it &s;till, while you figure forth your fanti&s;ie,</P>
<P>My faire Maidens (&s;aied <HI>Simonides</HI>) I am neither &s;o cor|rupt in nature, neither &s;o alinated from good nurture, to &s;aie
<PB REF="75"> one thyng and thinke an other, nor &s;o &s;eque&s;tred from all good gouernement, as not to conclude with iudgement and deter|mine with di&s;cretio~, if therfore you doubt I alter in any thing, I craue you to yeeld a rea&s;on before repul&s;e, and condemne not without a cau&s;e. <HI>Thucida</HI> y^e &s;econd returned him this an&s;were.</P>
<P><HI>Signior Simonides,</HI> if your opinion and thoughtes worke a like, the ende mu&s;t thus followe, that where you alowe &s;o pre|ci&s;ely you mu&s;t loue a little, els in contemnyng that you com|mende, we &s;hall condemne you in that you pleade not guiltie.</P>
<P>And will you binde me (Mi&s;tris) to that extreamitie (&s;aied <HI>Simonides</HI>) truely then the ca&s;e will goe harde, for if it mu&s;t be concluded, that I mu&s;t loue there where I commend, I &s;hould loue the white <HI>Mercurie</HI> though deadly poy&s;on, I &s;hould feede on the glorious Diamonde though rancke <HI>Aconitum,</HI> yea, I &s;hould by the deemyng of myne eye, bee domed to myne owne de&s;truction: but becau&s;e it is wi&s;edome to auoyde &s;uche an er|rour, faire Ladies I mu&s;t conclude this, that I loue you all be|yng beautifull, I honour you beyng vertuous, and reuerence you beyng wi&s;e.</P>
<P>I but (&s;aied Mi&s;tris <HI>Philida</HI>) the&s;e colours are not halfe wel &s;hadowed, I mu&s;t tey you within &s;horter limites, you loue vs all you &s;aie, &s;ir and we like you, but well I wot three &s;uche flees would comber one bed, and one &s;uche Gentleman, would be &s;hrewdly cloyed to mannage &s;uche a lea&s;he of merlines, you mu&s;t therefore growe to an equalitie, and alowyng one the &s;u|perioritie in beautie, &s;hrowd your &s;elf vnder her fauour, &s;o wee &s;hall be left to them that li&s;t, you aloted to her you loue, and the Gentlewoman wonne by your good like, loue hym faithfully whiche e&s;teemeth of her &s;o nobly.</P>
<P><HI>Simonides,</HI> vpon the &s;odaine thus tropmed vpon, was almo&s;t pa&s;t all helpe how to recouer hym&s;elf: notwith&s;tandyng, tru|&s;tyng vnto the plau&s;abilitie of his wit, he concluded all their circumuentions by this pretie delaie. It was a cu&s;tome (faire Ladies) among&s;t the mo&s;t renowned Cities bothe of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> in matters of importaunce, not to conclude vppon the opinion of the Citizens, but to refere the cen&s;ure to the Ora|cle of <HI>Appollo,</HI> who&s;e imitations &s;ince I knowe them nece&s;&s;a|rie,

<P>No &s;oner had he ended, but Madame <HI>Camilla</HI> brake vp the a&s;&s;embly, &s;o the night drawyng on, and the companie readie to departe, <HI>Philautus</HI> and <HI>Simonides,</HI> bothe takyng their leaue, withdrewe them to their Lodgyng, where <HI>Simonides,</HI> coun&s;ai|lyng with his pillowe, of that he had &s;een by daie, and remem|bryng hym&s;elf of his Mi&s;tris <HI>Clarinda,</HI> he brake out into this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

The &s;umptuous Buildin|ges of &s;tately Pallaces, the gorgious attire of the Ladies, the noble entertainment of the Gentlemen is to be accompted of, yet the vertue <HI>Simonides</HI> lookt for, beyng re&s;ident in contine~ce, not in exce&s;&s;e, I thinke it more conuenient to giue <HI>Englande,</HI> a worldly commendation, then &s;uche greate titles of vertue as I can not finde here.</P>
<P>Thou maie&s;t &s;ee now <HI>Simonides</HI> what tru&s;t is in vncertaine prai&s;e, what difference betweene the name and nature, and &s;ince thou ha&s;t gathered vp all the&s;e experiences together, confirme now thy &s;elf, returne al the&s;e benefites to <HI>Ciuill,</HI> where acquain|ted with thy Mi&s;tris <HI>Clarinda,</HI> thou mai&s;t practi&s;e the experi|mentes of all places in <HI>Ciuill,</HI> and hauyng attained the loue thou ha&s;t lo~g looked for, &s;ati&s;fie thy &s;elf with the remembrance of thy forepa&s;&s;ed trauailes: and confirmed by experience cea&s;e to doate vpon this wicked worlde to muche.</P>

<HEAD>&leaf; <HI>How</HI> Simonides <HI>&s;hippyng for</HI> Spayne ariued at Ciuill, and with what fruites his Loue concluded.</HEAD>
<P>_LIttle knewe the poore Louer how cold his entertainement &s;hould be in <HI>Ciuill,</HI> for <HI>Cla|rinda</HI> bothe forgettyng <HI>Simonides</HI> him&s;elf, and al&s;o her owne prote&s;tation of vowed cha&s;titie, after his departure for al her &s;im|peryng ciuillitie, became the maried wife of an olde doating Citizen called <HI>Baldio,</HI> a man neither of equalitie in yeares to fit her likyng, nor &s;hape of per&s;on to procure her plea&s;ure, but the onely cullice the Mi|&s;er had to comforte her, were a fewe ru&s;tie Crownes, &s;ealed vp in an olde bagge, which in rea&s;on, &s;hould not &s;o much preuaile to bewitche a faire Ladie, but &s;uche are the di&s;po&s;itions of wo|men, that like the Weathercocke thei turne at their plea&s;ures, and like a feather in the winde, they are moued with euery breath of per&s;wa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But <HI>Simonides</HI> ignoraunt of the &s;equell, ariued at <HI>Ciuill,</HI> the rumor of who&s;e returne, was brought to y^e eares of his father, but Lorde how plea&s;aunt were the&s;e newes to the olde man, how iocond was the mother, the whole Citie gaue him a frend|ly welcome: But as euery &s;weete is quickly ouerlaied with a little &s;owre, and the Sunne darkened with a blacke Cloude, &s;o the&s;e delightes were as &s;one cro&s;&s;ed, by the vniu&s;t di&s;a&s;ter of <HI>Clarinda</HI> the vncourteous. For, <HI>Simonides</HI> enquiryng for his Mi&s;tris, was aun&s;wered how &s;he was maried to an olde Mar|chaunt called <HI>Baldio</HI> her neighbour, how comfortable the&s;e ne|wes might be to <HI>Simonides,</HI> Louers, I reporte me to you, doe you thinke he did not take it greeuou&s;ly, yes a&s;&s;ure your &s;el|ues: He for&s;ooke all plea&s;ures of the Citie, and renting in pee|ces that tra&s;he whiche he had prouided for her, he enueied thus
<PB REF="77"> bitterly again&s;t womankinde.</P>
<P>Is this the fruites of Loue, O you Heauens, are the&s;e the rewardes of loyall &s;eruice, are womens fanta&s;ies &s;o fickle, and Ladies trothes &s;o vncertaine. Oh wicked &s;exe, that vnder faire white, &s;hrowde&s;t blacke venome, that vnder &s;eemely &s;ub&s;taun|ces, conclude&s;t vn&s;table perfections.
