<P>THe inclo&s;ing of <HI>Jarrow&s;like</HI> and making Balla&s;t-&s;hores on it, will greatly advantage the River <HI>Tyne</HI> and all Ships Trading to that Port, and be no real Damage to any, unle&s;s it be &s;o, to &s;ome Perticular Ballast-Wharfs already made on the River in places not &s;o fit for that &V;&s;e as this will be when tis done: The Pre&s;ervation of the River, or what may any way damage the Trade of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> in general, being intended to be provided for in the Bill.</P>

<HEAD>The Reports and Rea&s;ons of the <HI>Trinity-Hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ACCording to Your Maje&s;ties Order in Council, bearing date <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 5th. We have con&s;idered of the Allegations of Sir <HI>Charles Adderly</HI> Knight, and <HI>John Crook</HI> E&s;quire, concerning the erect|ing of a Balla&s;t-&s;hoar at <HI>Jarrowes-Slake</HI> near <HI>South-Sheild</HI> in the county o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Dure&s;me;</HI> And do Hum|bly make our Report that we are of opinion, That a Balla&s;t-Wharf at <HI>South-Sheilds</HI> will be of great u&s;e and benefit to all &s;hips Trading in the River <HI>Tine</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">or coals, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That it will prevent the lo&s;s of &s;hips in their coming for <HI>Tinmouth-bar,</HI> for that they have, and do at this day, ca&s;t out great part of their ballast before they come to the bar, &s;o to avoid the great charge after they are in the River of carrying up their balla&s;t in Keels to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> after which meet|ing with foul Weather, they have many times been ca&s;t away by rea&s;on of their Lightne&s;s.</P>
<P>2ly, It will be a means to &s;ecure great &s;hips from the ca&s;ualties which befall them, by their coming a Ground many have been Lost going up or coming down the River; at Lea&s;t, it will prevent the wronging of them when they lye on hard Ground or Rocks, going to, or coming from <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> where|by the &s;hips will last the longer; and it will al&s;o give them a much quicker di&s;patch in their Voyages.</P>
<P>3ly, It will be an Encouragement for Men to build great &s;hips for that Trade, &s;uch as may be u&s;eful for defence of the Kingdom in time of War, and much more proper for that Trade than &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>4ly, That the Price of taking out the balla&s;t at <HI>Sheilds</HI> being moderately &s;et, It will be a great In|couragement to Navigation, for that the price of taking it out by the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> is very high.</P>
<P>5ly, That by means hereof Ma&s;ters of &s;hips may make two or three Voyages more in a year, the charge of taking out their balla&s;t being le&s;sned, and the time of going up the River being &s;aved and their &s;hips hereby the better pre&s;erved, and being great Ships mo&s;t proper for that Trade, they may &s;ell Coals much cheaper to the benefit of the Publick, and get more money to their Owners than now they do, and all this with le&s;s hazard; All which we Humbly &s;ubmit to Your Sacred Maje&s;ties mo&s;t prudent Con&s;ideration.</P>
