<P>Before the Arrival of Admiral <HI>Evert&s;en,</HI> it was agreed between the Two Na|tions, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;hould have the Van-guard, which was in all likely|hood to do them Honour; but at the bottom, to conceal <HI>Torrington</HI>'s De&s;igns, af|ter they had been under Sail about Two or Three Hours, they were obliged to come to an Anchor, by rea&s;on of the Foggs and bad Weather: But &s;oon after they perceived the <HI>French</HI> Fleet to bear up towards them, with the Wind at Ea&s;t-Immediately they weighed Anchor, and endeavoured to gain the Weather-gage, which they did with that &s;ucce&s;s, that <HI>Torrington</HI> gave the Signal for the fir&s;t Squadron to Engage, but the <HI>French</HI> thought fit to retire. The 6, 7 8, and 9th. the Two Fleets were always in view of one another; but in regard the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was much the &s;tronger, both for Number and bigue&s;s of Ships, it was judged mo&s;t proper not to fight in the open Sea, and <HI>Torrington</HI> did his part &s;o well, that he avoided engaging till he was come to the <HI>Beve&s;ier,</HI> which was fa|vourable for his Purpo&s;e. And there it was that he received the Queen's Orders, not to delay Engaging, if the Wind and Weather would permit, which was the Rea&s;on that upon the 10th. by break of day, we went to &s;eek the Enemy, who expected us in order of Battel, and &s;o by nine of the Clock, the Engagement be|gan between the Blew Squadron of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Van-guard of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and both &s;ides fired de&s;perately for Three Hours together, till the <HI>French</HI> Squa|dron not liking their Entertainment, bore away with all the tack they could make; but about one there happened a Calm, which not only prevented the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Pur&s;uit, but put them into a little Di&s;order; upon which, the <HI>French</HI> (whom the &s;ame Calm hindred from getting away, were con&s;trained to begin the Fight again, which la&s;ted till five a Clock in the Evening, with an incredible Fury. As for what concerns the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> mo&s;t certainly, unle&s;s it were &s;ome few Ve&s;&s;els that fought again&s;t <HI>Torrington</HI>'s Order, the re&s;t did nothing at all: So that the main Body of the <HI>French</HI> fell into the Rear of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet; &s;o that having fought from Morning till Evening, and having defended them&s;elves &s;o long again&s;t &s;uch a prodigious Number of the Enemy, that a&s;&s;ailed them on every &s;ide, they were &s;o very much batter'd, that hardly Three were capable of making any Defence; which con&s;trained them to make their way through the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and bear away to the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> between <HI>Beve&s;ier</HI> and <HI>Ferly;</HI> Admiral <HI>Frackel, Jean Dick,</HI> and Captain <HI>Northey</HI> were &s;lain; the <HI>Vrei&s;landt</HI> ha|ving lo&s;t all her Ma&s;ts, and not being to be towed off by rea&s;on of the Calm, was taken towards the end of the Fight. Admiral <HI>Evert&s;en</HI> gave this Te&s;timony of all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers and Soldiers, That there was not one that did not exactly perform his Duty; and as for the Admiral him&s;elf, though he would not &s;peak his own Prai&s;e, in his Letter to the States; yet all Men give him this Character, That he &s;ignalized him&s;elf by the greate&s;t Actions that a true Valour could in|&s;pire, and which de&s;erve an equal Fame with that of <HI>Trump</HI> or <HI>de Ruyter.</HI> In &s;hort, it was never heard that ever Twenty two Ships fought &s;o long again&s;t Four&s;core and Two, of which Seventeen carried no le&s;s than &s;ome Four&s;core and &s;ome an hundred Guns.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> had we known no more than what the Ad|miral of <HI>Holland</HI> out of his Mode&s;ty writes, we had known nothing at all: But in a Letter which a per&s;on of Honour in <HI>England</HI> wrote to the Lord <HI>Dur&s;ly,</HI> there is this Expre&s;&s;ion, which better informs us, <HI>That the</HI> Holland <HI>Squadron behaved them&s;elves with &s;o much Bravery, that if the Lord</HI> Torrington <HI>had done his Duty, in all probability we had won an ab&s;olute Victory.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had but Two Captains &s;lain, and Three Ships di&s;abled, which are thought to be the only Ships that fought without the Lord <HI>Torrington</HI>'s Order.</P>
