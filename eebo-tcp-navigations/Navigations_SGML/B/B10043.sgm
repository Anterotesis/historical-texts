<HEAD>THE Si&s;ters Complaint For the Decay of the GALLANTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Tune of, <HI>Will Womens Vanities never have End.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>YE Geudly Si&s;ters! have a care</L>
<L>How you the&s;e Gallants tru&s;t,</L>
<L>A &s;adder Tale you ne're did hear,</L>
<L>Then now unfold, I mu&s;t.</L>
<L>It hapned lately that a Fair Maid,</L>
<L>In <HI>London,</HI> would have &s;et up her Trade,</L>
<L>But by a Gallant was made a Jade.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what &s;hall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>She thought him able, to perform</L>
<L>What e're he undertook,</L>
<L>And knew he could do her no harm,</L>
<L>For all his Lofty Look.</L>
<L>She was in hopes to have enough,</L>
<L>But when it came unto the proof,</L>
<L>This Gallant went out like a Candle Snuff.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what &s;hall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Fir&s;t at the Tavern, they did move</L>
<L>Their Active Bloods, with Wine.</L>
<L>She &s;aw that this would not improve,</L>
<L>Or further her de&s;ign;</L>
<L>With that &s;he Thought if this would not do 'it,</L>
<L>They'd have a Dram of Brandy to boot,</L>
<L>The Dev'l's in't then if he come not to't.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what &s;hall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>So hand in hand away they went,</L>
<L>To &s;ee how this would take,</L>
<L>And &s;tayd not long for the Event,</L>
<L>Such Courage Brandies make.</L>
<L>For they had not been long at the Platter,</L>
<L>But at him, her Mouth did water,</L>
<L>And he, was eager to be at her.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what &s;hall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>They had no opportunity,</L>
<L>To play their Loving Game,</L>
<L>But where another Girl did lye,</L>
<L>No matter for her Name.</L>
<L>Who it &s;eems did play Bo-peep,</L>
<L>Or, as they call it, &s;lept Dog-&s;leep,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e &s;he did their Reckoning keep.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what &s;hall we do?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>They did enjoy their wi&s;ht content,</L>
<L>Within the Naked Bed.</L>
<L>But e're her brisk de&s;ire was &s;pent,</L>
<L>The Gallant, he, was Dead.</L>
<L>Yet, in an hour, it is well known,</L>
<L>He was but fower times up and down,</L>
<L>If none but &s;uch Men &s;erve the Town.</L>
<L><HI>Alack what &s;hall we do?</HI></L>
