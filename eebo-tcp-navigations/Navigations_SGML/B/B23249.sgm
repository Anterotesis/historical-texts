<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce what I have formerly imparted to you was &s;o well accepted, I have thought good to continue my corre&s;|pondence with you, by relating &s;everal things that have fallen out on Board us &s;ince my la&s;t: I told you then, that the great Coun|cel of Officers was called, whereby the Say|lers hoped to have had the Ship put into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a condition, as not to have fear'd the attempts either of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> or the <HI>Algerines,</HI> but might have rendred the hopes of the one, and the expectations of the other fru&s;trated; our hopes hereof were very much heightned, when at the opening of the Councel, the noble Captain gave them large a&s;&s;urance of his ready compliance with all the means they &s;hould think convenient, to this end the Councel upon &s;erious debate, and mature deliberation, came to this Re&s;olve, That the only way to &s;ecure the Ship, and the Chri&s;tian Religion, again&s;t the attempts of the <HI>Maho|metans,</HI> was by an order of the Captain and his Councel of Officers, to di&s;able the Lieute|nant from &s;ucceeding to the Captains place after the Captains death, all other ways being in&s;ufficient and dangerous, like the fal&s;e heal|ing of a Wound, or Building on a rotten Foun|dation: The Captain not liking their proceed|ing, &s;ent them word by an Officer, that a &s;mall Pinnace belonging to the Ship, was in danger to be taken by &s;ome &s;et on and incouraged as it's thought by the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Algerines,</HI> e&s;pecially the latter, from whom it is thought they have been furni&s;hed with Powder, Shot, and Guns, wherewith to batter this Pinnace, and therefore he would have them let the Lieutenant alone, and bend all their thoughts to the defence of this Pinnace, &s;ince it was of &s;o great con&s;equence to the <HI>Van-Herring,</HI> that if once lo&s;t, we can never Trade into the Straits with &s;afety: the Councel after a &s;eri|ous debate on this Me&s;&s;age, re&s;olved to draw up an Addre&s;s to the Captain, wherein they a&s;&s;ured him they would withal readine&s;s com|ply with the motion of relieving the Pinnace, if there might be a &s;atisfying a&s;&s;urance given them, that it would be in order to the &s;ecu|ring the Old Ship, which they were humbly bold to tell him, they had found by woful ex|perience hitherto, to be altogether manned with, and mannaged by the <HI>Mahometans;</HI> and they appeal'd to the Captain him&s;elf, that he knew it was not long &s;ince one of the Arch-Traytors, now in the Hold, for endeavouring to Murther the Captain, and &s;eize the Ship for the Lieutenant, &s;ayled in, and commanded this Pinnace; therefore &s;ince the whole Ship was in danger to be lo&s;t, they could not ha|zard the whole Ship by endeavouring to re|lieve this Pinnace, which had been a Ne&s;t of our implacable Enemies the <HI>Mahometans:</HI> they al&s;o with all humility &s;hewed him, that all, or mo&s;t of the &s;upplies they had formerly given to maintain the Captains Honour, and the Ships &s;afety, were abu&s;ed by ill Officers, the de&s;ign wholly inverted to &s;erve the <HI>Mahome|tans</HI> intere&s;t. They told him al&s;o, that &s;ince the be&s;t defence this Ship had, was to endea|vour the advancing the Chri&s;tian Religion abroad, they admired to find his Officers en|deavouring to procure <HI>Mahometan Chappels</HI> in other Chri&s;tian Ships: they de&s;ired al&s;o, that tho&s;e which endeavoured to render the en|deavours of this Councel, as dangerous to the Captains Intere&s;t, might be looked on by him as Enemies to him and his Government: The Councel have al&s;o puni&s;hed &s;ome per&s;ons, that by ob&s;tructing Petitions for the meeting of this Councel, have betrayed the Liberty of the Saylers, which we hope will have this good effect, that in the Vacan&s;y of Councel, there will be no more Abhorrors found among&s;t us. They have al&s;o made &s;everal Addre&s;&s;es to the Captain, to remove from his Pre&s;ence &s;everal pernicious Officers, who by their fawning words, and flattering Councels, would draw his affection from the Loyal Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lers, one of them was chief Clark to the great Cabbine, him they have got removed, but the re&s;t re|main as they were, only one advanced by the influence of the Lieutenant to the dignity of chief Boat-Swain, was by the Councel of the lower Bench charged with Trea&s;on again&s;t the Captain, and betraying the Liberty of the Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lers, requiring to have him &s;ecured, but could not prevail; the Councel of the lower Bench after many debates and con&s;ultations, drew up an order to di&s;able the Lieutenant to &s;ucceed to the Captains place after the Cap|tains death. Now Sir; I cannot tell you the
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">different humors that filled the Saylers; all men were big with expectation what would become of this order, when pre&s;ented to the Councel of the upper Bench, all per&s;wading them&s;elves it would be according to their own de&s;ires; the Councel of the lower Bench hand|ed it to the Officers of the upper Bench, where the Captain &s;at, where after &s;ome debate, it was rejected, to the great grief of the Chri|&s;tian Saylers, and the Joy of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faction; the Officers of the Red Robe were indifferently divided, but tho&s;e of the White Robe, although they pretend to be the Pillars of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and have long been thought by &s;ome of the Saylers to be &s;o; Yet now to convince the World, their own pre|tences were untrue, and the Saylers good opinion of them fal&s;e; they mo&s;t of them came in as a dead weight, and &s;peedily carried the Scale on the Lieutenants &s;ide, which is a thing &s;o &s;trange, that it makes &s;ome of the Saylers think, that as they were the Relicks of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, which remains unpurged, when the re&s;t of their Innovations were expelled this Ship; &s;o they have &s;ecret inclinations to return again to the Obedience of the <HI>Mufty.</HI> Yet &s;omething has been done to the di&s;couraging the <HI>Mahomitans,</HI> and in|couraging the Chri&s;tian Saylers; for one of the Arch Traytors was at la&s;t brought to his Tryal before the Councel, and condemned to loo&s;e his Head upon the Cap&s;torm, which was done accordingly; the Coun&s;el notwith&s;tand|ing the rejecting the Order, con&s;ulted of &s;ome other way to di&s;able the Lieutenant, which to prevent, the Captain minded them again of the danger of the Pinnis, whereupon they re&s;olved to draw up another Addre&s;s to the Captain, wherein they gave him great thanks for the care he had taken to prevent the <HI>Ma|hometan</HI> de&s;ign, and his gracious promi&s;e of complying with all means they &s;hould think convenient for &s;ecuring the Ship; yet they much grieved to find his promi&s;e &s;o limited, as to render it wholly u&s;ele&s;s, by refu&s;ing to grant that wherein alone our &s;afety doth con|&s;i&s;t, there being no &s;afety to him or the Ship, until the Lieutenant be Excluded; all the An|&s;wer the Captain returned, was, that the Councel of the upper Bench, by rejecting the Order, had confirmed him in an Opinion, that it is not his Intere&s;t to de&s;ert the Lieutenant; the Coun&s;el hereat amazed, after &s;ome De|bate, entred into the Journal of their Proceed|ings, That it is their Opinion, that there can be no &s;ecurity to the Captain, the Ship, or the Chri&s;tian Religion, without preventing the Lieutenant from being Captain; and that notwith&s;tanding the Captains promi&s;es of complying with all other ways of &s;ecuring us, that unle&s;s this Order be pa&s;&s;ed, they can give him no &s;upplies, without Betraying the Cap|tains per&s;on, the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by the Saylers; and who&s;oever &s;hould advi&s;e the Captain to put off this Councel to any other purpo&s;e then to the making this Order, are betrayers of the Cap|tain, the Chri&s;tian Religion, and Promoters of and Pentioners to <HI>Argere,</HI> and that the thanks of this Bench be given to the Saylers in the great Cabbine, for their Loyalty to, and en|deavors for the pre&s;ervation of the Captain, and the Chri&s;tian Religion; immediately they were put off for a few days, which the <HI>Maho|metans</HI> have the impudence to &s;ay, it was done in favour to them, but the Loyal Saylers hope the contrary, and that it is only to give the Councel an occa&s;ion to bring in the Order again; yet the Saylers of the great Cabbine, fearing the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> might take this op|portunity to attempt &s;omething again&s;t the Cabbine, reque&s;ted the Ma&s;ter of this Cabbine to take all imaginable care for its pre&s;erva|tion. I had almo&s;t forgotten one thing that hath occa&s;ioned much di&s;cour&s;e among&s;t us; a Loyal Officer made an ingenious Speech, containing a &s;hort and true Account of our Affairs: It was condemned by &s;ome, although others think it will prove &s;omewhat like a late Treati&s;e, called, <HI>The Growth of Mahometani&s;m,</HI> which when fir&s;t Publi&s;hed, was generally condemned as a de&s;ign fal&s;ly to a&s;per&s;e the Captains Favourites, but in &s;hort time we found the thing too true. I &s;hould have told you al&s;o, that while the Councel of Officers were inquiring into this Plot, &s;ome came on Board us from on Board the <HI>Harp,</HI> and ac|quainted our Councel, that Ship al&s;o was in danger to be Betrayed to the <HI>Algerines:</HI> We are informed, that the <HI>Algerines,</HI> by the help of the <HI>Mufty</HI> and his Agents, have got a Stout Ship that Rides near us, called, The <HI>Eagle,</HI> to be &s;o Betrayed by the Captains Officers, that it mu&s;t &s;hortly fall into their hands. As for our Lieutenant, he at pre&s;ent Sayles in the <HI>Lyon,</HI> but is expected on Board us; I &s;up|po&s;e his ab&s;ence will be more welcome to them, then his pre&s;ence to us: ju&s;t as I was fini&s;hing this Letter, I &s;aw the Sayles flocking about the Main-Ma&s;t, whereupon I went to enquire the rea&s;on, and found them with great amazement and admiration reading an Order of the Captains for di&s;charging this Councel of Officers, and calling a New one, which are not to meet in the Old Cabbin, which they have done time out of mind, but in the Aca|demy, a &s;mall Cabbin in a more remote part of the Ship; this unexpected and prodigious News filled the Loyal Saylers with &s;ad hearts and dejected countenances, yea, the Heavens have put on Mourning, appearing Dark and Gloomy, and the Sun not &s;een for three or four days together. Thus I have given you a &s;hort but impartial account of all or mo&s;t of the material things that have fallen out &s;ince my la&s;t.</P>
