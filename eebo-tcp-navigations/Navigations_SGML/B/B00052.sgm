<HEAD>&para; Of the Region of <HI>Tarta|ria,</HI> and of the Lawes and power of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_TArtaria,</HI> which by ano|ther name is called <HI>Mon|gall,</HI> as <HI>Vicencio</HI> writeth, &s;tandeth towardes the northea&s;t, and at the Ea&s;t parte ioyneth with the Land of the <HI>Catheos</HI> and <HI>Solangos:</HI> on the South parte it bordereth with y^e Country of <HI>Sartanecos,</HI> &amp; on the We&s;t parte with that of the <HI>Naymanos,</HI> and of the North parte it is co~pa&s;&s;ed about with the Occean Seas. It was called <HI>Tartaria,</HI> by rea&s;on of a Riuer running by it, called <HI>Tartar,</HI> and is a Region where the greate&s;t parte is full of Moun|taines, and the mo&s;t part of the plaine fields verie &s;andie, being a barren countrey, &s;auing that &s;ome parte of it is ouerflowen with the waters of y^e Ryuers, &amp; a great parte thereof is wilderne&s;&s;e &amp; litle inhabited. Ther are no Cities nor Townes in it, &s;auing onelye the Citie of <HI>Cracuris.</HI> Ther is &s;o great want and &s;mal &s;tore of wood in it, that the people there are driuen to v&s;e for the mo&s;t parte the offall and dung of Oxen and Hor&s;es for their fuel, a&s;well in ro&s;ting and boyling their victuals,
<PB REF="5"> as otherwi&s;e. The ayre of this Region is ve|ry intemperate, and full of &s;tormes and tem|pe&s;ts, that in the &s;ommer time there are &s;uch wonderfull thunders and lightninges, that men die for very feare of the &s;ame. At other times there is great heat, and immediate|ly followeth verye extreame colde, and &s;nowe falling very thicke. The windes there are &s;o boy&s;terous an &s;trong almo&s;t continu|ally, that they drawe men backward as they are ryding on their iournyes, ouerthrowing them to the ground, and al&s;o blowe vp trees by the rootes, and to conclude do much other harme. In the winter it neuer rayneth, in the &s;ummer many times, and at euery of the &s;ame &s;o little, that &s;car&s;elye it wetteth the ground: and yet for all this it is a rich coun|trey of all kinde of cattell, as well oxen as Camels, &amp;c. Of bea&s;tes of &s;eruice and hor|&s;es there is &s;o great &s;tore and plentie, that it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, there are not &s;o many moe in all the re&s;t of the worlde. There were at the beginning in this Realme foure &s;ortes of people: The fir&s;t &s;orte called <HI>Yeca Mon|gales,</HI> which is as much to &s;aye the great <HI>Mongales:</HI> The &s;econd &s;orte called <HI>Sumon|gales,</HI> which &s;ignifieth the <HI>Mongales</HI> of the water, becau&s;e they dwell neere to the Riuer
<PB N="2" REF="5"> <HI>Tartar,</HI> whereof they beare the name of <HI>Tar|tars:</HI> The third are called <HI>Mercat,</HI> and the fourth &s;orte <HI>Metrit:</HI> All the&s;e had one man|ner of &s;hape of body, and v&s;ed all one lan|guage. Their manner of lyuing at the fir&s;te was fearce &amp; barbarous, without any lawes or policie, they lyued by the increa&s;e of rattell, and were a bruite people, and little regarded among the <HI>Scithians.</HI> Afterwarde in proce&s;&s;e of tyme they deuided and &s;euered them &s;elues into certaine places and be|gan to take theyr Captaines in companie which had charge of the whole common wealth, and yet for all that cea&s;ed not to pay tribute to the <HI>Naymanos,</HI> which next adioy|ned to them, vntill that by chaunce one <HI>Can|gui&s;ta</HI> a man brought vp among them, was elected for their king, by meanes of an Ora|cle and reuelation. This man immediately after he had receiued the Empire and So|uereigne gouernment, commaunded that all honour accu&s;tomed to be done to the deuill, &s;hould cea&s;&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by his generall edicte, that all people &s;houlde honour and wor&s;hip one onelye GOD, the migh|tie&s;t, greate&s;t and be&s;t of all others, and al&s;o gaue expre&s;&s;e commandement, that it &s;hould be generally publi&s;hed that he had receyued the Realme by the &s;ame Gods prouidence.
<PB REF="6"> After this he commaunded that all &s;uch as could beare armour, &s;hould come forthwith and repre&s;ent them &s;elues before him by a certeine day. And all the people apt for the warres being come together, he in his owne per&s;on hauing taken the number of them, de|uided them in order, and appoynted ouer the~ Corporals, Sargents, Captaines and Co|ronels. &amp;c. After this, to proue what force and power he had in the empire and &s;upreme authoritie: he commaunded &s;euen of the mo&s;t principall men that fir&s;t had the charge and gouernment of all the Realme, to kill their &s;onnes with their owne handes, the which though it was and &s;eemed a very hard thing vnto the~, yet they acco~pli&s;hed it forthwith, be+ing moued thervnto, partly for feare of the co~|mon people, and partly by rea&s;on of a deuout &s;uper&s;tition in that they had conceiued a &s;tedfa&s;t beliefe that God was the beginning and foundation of that kingdome, and that if they refu&s;ed to obey the commaundementes of their king, they committed not an offence to him, but to God. And with this tru&s;t and power &s;o ray&s;ed, the king <HI>Cangui&s;ta,</HI> fir&s;t of all brought vnder his &s;ubiection, by force of armes, the <HI>Scithians</HI> that bordered vpon his countrey making them his tributaries, with
<PB N="3" REF="6"> the other people al&s;o to whom his owne &s;ub|iects had before payed tribute, and forthwith &s;et vpon diuers other nations both farre and neere from his owne dominions, hauing &s;o pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e, that he brought in &s;ub|iection vnder his Empyre all the Realmes, Dominions &amp; nations, euen from <HI>Scithia</HI> vn|to the <HI>Mediterran</HI> &s;ea, wher the Sun ry&s;eth, &amp; &s;ome what more, in&s;omuch that with rea&s;on he intituleth him &s;elfe Lord and Emperour of all the Ea&s;t partes.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Tartars</HI> are of an euill &s;hape in their bodies, the mo&s;t part of them being of a &s;mall &s;tature. They haue great eyes, &s;tan|ding farre out, and the liddes thereof coue|red with very much hayre, in &s;uch &s;orte that there can but a litle of their eies be &s;ene, their faces are brode, they haue no beards, &s;auing on their vpper lips, &amp; in the &s;ame haue but a few hayres, and tho&s;e very thin: al of them for the mo&s;t part are &s;lender in the wa&s;t, in the fore pare of their heads they weare their hayre long like women of our countrey, and make two rowles thereof, and &s;o gather the~ behind their eares: and not only the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> do thus, but al&s;o &s;uch as are ioyning nere to them do the like. They are light peo|ple and good hor&s;emen, but euill foote|men,
<PB REF="7"> none of them do go afoote, although they be very little. Their manner is to ride vpon hor&s;es or oxen whether &s;o euer they tra|uaile, and the women v&s;e Geldinges that are not fierce. They al&s;o v&s;e to haue their forheds decked with &s;iluer and precious &s;tones, and conceiue a great glorye, in that their hor&s;es carry collers of belles to make a great iyng|ling. Their &s;peach is &s;harpe and high, when they would &s;inge they howle like wolues, when they drinke they &s;hake the head, and al|&s;o they accu&s;tome to drinke &s;o often, tyll they fall downe, and take it for great honour.</P>
<P>They inhabite neither townes nor cities, but in the fieldes, as the <HI>Scithians</HI> did in the olde time, vnder Pauilions and Tentes: For the mo&s;t parte are &s;hepheardes. In the win|ter they v&s;e to lyue in the plaine fieldes, in the Sommer they continue in the moun|taines, for the fruitefulne&s;&s;e of the pa&s;ture. They make their lodginges and plates of abode like a &s;hoppe eyther of bowes, or of timber, couered with felt, and in the midde&s;t of the&s;e &s;heddes, make a rounde windowe where the light commeth in, and the &s;moke goeth out, in the midde&s;t of the cottage is the fire, and their wiues and children alwayes about it. The men v&s;e to &s;hoote in bowes,
<PB N="4" REF="7"> and to wra&s;tle, they are merueilous hunters, they ride a hu~ting armed on hor&s;back, &amp; whe~ they &s;ee any wilde bea&s;tes, they compa&s;&s;e them about, and euery one of them &s;hooting his arow, they wound, &amp; take him. They haue no bread, v&s;e no table cloth nor napkins, and beleeue in one God onely, affyrming him to be the maker of all thinges, vi&s;ible and inui|&s;ible, they honour him not with any ceremo|nie, but make certeine Iodls of felt, or &s;ilke, or the likene&s;&s;e of a man, and put them on both &s;ides of their &s;heddes or &s;hoppes, praying them to keepe &s;afe their cattell, and &s;hewing great reuerence toward them, offe|ring them all the milke that they haue fir&s;t of the cattell, and before they beginne to eate or drinke, they &s;et their part before them. Any manner of bea&s;t that they kyll for to eate, they put his hart in a ve&s;&s;ell all night, and in the morning &s;eeth and eate it. They honour and do &s;acrifi&s;e likewi&s;e to the Sunne and Moone, to the foure Elements, and al&s;o the great <HI>Chaam</HI> their king and Lorde, whome they thinke to be the Sonne of God, and &s;o honour him deuoutly, and do &s;acrifice to him, and beleue that in al the world there is none better, nor of more dignitie then he, neyther wil they con&s;e~t y^t any other be named but be.</P>
<PB REF="8">
<P>This people in re&s;pect of them &s;elues, thinking no other nation worthy to be com|pared with them, in wi&s;dome nor goodne&s;&s;e, and therfore will not willingly &s;peake with any other, but rather auoyd them &s;elues from their companies. They call the Pope and al other Chri&s;tians dogges and Idolaters al|ledging that they honour &s;tones and &s;tockes. They are much adicted to wicked arts, geue credit to dreames, and enterteine and allow &s;uch as v&s;e the magicall &s;cience and arte of diuination, and can enterpret their dreames: Al&s;o they a&s;ke que&s;tions and receiue an&s;wer of their Idols, with ful per&s;wa&s;ion and be|liefe that God &s;peaketh in them. And ther|fore what enterpri&s;e &s;o euer they take in|hand, they begin and proceede in the &s;ame by the coun&s;ell of tho&s;e Idols. They behold and marke the weather very much, and e&s;pe|cially the Moone: for they make no diffe|rence of one tyme more then of an other, nor honour any fe&s;tiuall day, ne v&s;e any manner of fa&s;ting or ab&s;tinence. At all times they liue after one fa&s;hion, and are &s;o coue|tous, that what &s;oeuer they &s;ee, if it like them well, if they cannot get it with the good will of the owner, being no <HI>Tartar,</HI> they take it from him by plaine &s;tafford law, accoun|ting
<PB N="5" REF="8"> it a matter lawfull to be don by meanes of a commaundement and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the king their &s;ouereign Lord. For they haue an ordinance of their <HI>Cangui&s;ta</HI> and <HI>Chaam</HI> their fir&s;t king, that any manner of <HI>Tartar</HI> or <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;eruaunt finding by the way as he trauaileth any hor&s;e, man, or woman without a letter or &s;afe conduct of the king, may &s;en&s;e and take them as his owne, and enioy them foreuer. They lend their monye to &s;uch as &s;tand in neede of it, and take a certeine kind of v&s;urie, both very great and al&s;o intollera|ble: for they take after the rate often pounds vppon the hundred for euerie moneth, and if the v&s;urie money be not payde immediatly, then they they take further v&s;urie. They con|&s;traine the people &s;ubued vnto them to paye &s;o exce&s;&s;iue tribute and taxes, and &s;o greatly mole&s;t and oppre&s;&s;e them, that there is no people read of, that &s;o much mole&s;teth their tributarie &s;ubiects. Their couetou&s;ne&s;&s;e is &s;uch, as is &s;kant credible to be beleeued, they are alwayes crauing and brybing, yea the mo&s;t Lordes of all others, geue nothing to any, no not to &s;uch as are in nece&s;&s;itie, nei|ther giue to poore people almes: onelye in this they &s;eeme worthy of &s;ome commenda|tion, that if any gue&s;tes by chaunce come to
<PB REF="9"> them when they be at meate, and would take parte with them, they turne them not awaye nor di&s;turb them, but rather inuite them, and geue them of that they eate with much pitie. In their diet they are very filthy hauing nei|ther tables to eate vppon, nor table clothes, nor napkins, &amp; v&s;e not to wa&s;h their ha~ds nor bodyes, nor clothes. They eate no bread, for they haue it not, nor any manner of hearbes, but feede onely with the fle&s;h of al manner of bea&s;tes, and likewi&s;e pigs fle&s;h, and of cats, hor&s;es and rats: and when they take any pri|&s;oner of their enemies, to &s;hew their crueltie the more, and the de&s;ire they haue to reuenge them &s;elues, &s;omtimes they roa&s;t them at the fire, and after manye of them a&s;&s;emble and eate him, like vnto wolues, they teare him in peeces, and eate his fle&s;h, and take the blood the which they keepe in certein ve&s;&s;elles and drink it, although that otherwi&s;e their accu&s;|tomed drinke is the mylke of bea&s;tes. They haue no wine among them, but if by chaunce any be brought thyther to them, they drinke it with great de&s;ire and affection, as all o|ther men do. Likewi&s;e they eate the lyce one of an other, taking them out of their heades, or any other place: and when they haue ta|ken them, they &s;ay that they wil do &s;o by theyr
<PB N="6" REF="9"> enemies. They take it for a great euill a|mong them, when any part of their meate or drink falleth from them, or is lo&s;t, and throw not their boanes to dogges, before they haue fully burni&s;hed them. They v&s;e &s;uch &s;carcitie and niggardne&s;&s;e of all thinges, that they neyther kill nor eate any manner of bea&s;te while it is whole and &s;ounde, but when it is lame, or hath &s;ome impediment in the body, or whe~ it beginneth to wax old, or by chaunce is &s;icke: In all other thinges they are verye mode&s;t, for they content them&s;elues with ve|ry little meate. In the morning they drinke a ve&s;&s;ell full of mylke, and afterwarde manye tymes neyther eate nor drinke in al the day. The apparell they v&s;e is wel neere after one &s;orte, as wel men as women. The men weare vpon their heades a certeine thing, not very depe, which is playn before, and behind hath a tayle well neere a &s;panne long, and as much in breadth, and bicau&s;e it may &s;tande clo&s;e to the head, and not be blowne of for the winde, they haue certeine gardes &s;ow|ed with it, neere to the eares, wherewith they binde them vnder the chinne. The mar|ried women weare a garment made lyke to a round ba&s;ket, a foote and a halfe long, and the hygher parte of them playne much
<PB REF="10"> after the fa&s;hion of a boote, being of many coulours, al garni&s;hed and edged about with &s;ilke, or Peacocks feathers, and layde ouer with many precious &s;tones, and golde: and the re&s;t of the bodye euery one apparelleth according to their habilities, the riche&s;t &s;ort of grayne and &s;ilke after the &s;ame manner that their hu&s;bands do, they haue cotes made full of pleites, open in the left &s;ide, whereby they put them on and off, hauing four or fiue lowpes or buttons to keepe them together and fa&s;t to theyr bodies. The apparell they weare in the &s;ommer, is for the mo&s;t parte black, and that which they weare in the cold and rayny wether is white: the&s;e cloths reach no lower the~ to the knee: the mayde~s are not ea&s;ily knowne from the married wiues, nor the women from the men: for almo&s;t they haue the like faces and apparel that the men haue, euery one equally and after one &s;ort v&s;e all their &s;mall apparell alike. When they en|ter into battaile, &s;ome of them weare armour vpon their armes with certeine yron leaues, which they tye together with &s;tringes, other v&s;e leather many times doubled, and in the like &s;orte they arme their heades, there are few that v&s;e Launces, and long &s;wordes, but commonly they carry &s;hort &s;wordes, three
<PB N="7" REF="10"> &s;pannes long, round with a &s;harpe edge on the &s;ide, and with the&s;e they wounde their &s;ides when they fight.
