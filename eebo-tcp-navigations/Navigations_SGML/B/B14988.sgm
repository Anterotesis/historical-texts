<HEAD>THE LAMENTABLE DEATH OF CAPTAINE <HI>Andrew Shilling,</HI> who was &s;laine by the <HI>Portingals,</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph.</HEAD>
<P>_I Will neither talke of the <HI>Roman</HI> glory, nor the <HI>Roman</HI> Vertues, which made that glo|ry &s;o tran&s;lucent to the lookers on; but how? by commemo|ration of hy&s;tory, and publication of their worthine&s;&s;e to the world, which was ap|parant in nothing more, then the rewar|ding of well de&s;erving men, or remem|bring them to po&s;teritie by &s;ome relation, or other; thus at this day is the <HI>Common
<PB N="2" REF="4">Wealth</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> famo&s;ed for ob&s;erving the rules of <HI>Aha&s;huero&s;h,</HI> in keeping the cu&s;tome of attention to his owne <HI>Chronicles,</HI> and then making a &s;top at <HI>Mordechaies</HI> &s;aving his life, asking what had beene done to the man of &s;o great de&s;erving, and when an&s;were was made nothing (oh ble&s;&s;ed be tho&s;e times, wherein Princes will demand &s;uch que&s;tions, and Courtiers be &s;o hone&s;t to tell the truth) you know what follow|ed? and my heart leaps for ioy to &s;ee the Emperour &s;o gratious: From hence other <HI>Common-Wealths</HI> haue, or &s;hould haue &s;uch Regi&s;ters, as a man by <HI>Alphabet</HI> may finde out the memorable actions of others im|ployed in their Countries &s;eruice, or &s;uch <HI>Antiquaries</HI> as &s;hall expo&s;e the Noble <HI>Achieu|ments</HI> of heroijck &s;pirits in what kinde &s;o ever. As for their interpo&s;ition? that would haue none, but men of Honour, and great <HI>Captaines</HI> nominated, I am &s;od|den in my que&s;tion, how came they to be &s;o Honourable? but from humbled Aunce&s;tors, and poore beginnings? and all from the advancement and donation of Maie&s;tick Princes?</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<P>Oh God? he, that &s;aw the <HI>Danow,</HI> and the va&s;t mouth of <HI>Hister,</HI> gaping vpon the blacke Sea: hee that looked vpon <HI>Nilus</HI> &s;even gates opening them&s;elues vpon the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea: Hee that fol|loweth the <HI>Rhine</HI> in his triple divi&s;ion, and braving the <HI>Ocean</HI> with his &s;treames, and al&s;o &s;aw the weake &s;wellings vnder the <HI>Alpes,</HI> or trickling drops come out of the Hils, would wonder at the progre&s;&s;e of the&s;e Rivers, and &s;tand amazed to con|ceiue, that &s;uch poore &s;prings &s;hould in|crea&s;e to &s;uch huge &s;treames: thus fareth it with men of good de&s;erving, the more meane, and ob&s;cure, the more glory and honour to make their vertue extend &s;o farre, as true notice and memory of their actions, or to &s;tepp out of the common tract of drudging and de&s;pi&s;ed poverty, to take braver &s;teps toward renowne, and riches.</P>
<P>Therefore I embrace Ma&s;ter <HI>Hacklife</HI> for his voyages: the Travellers of our time for their iournals: the Chronolo|gers for their inventories: the writers of Story, for their records of memorable
<PB N="4" REF="5">men, and all the lovers of their Country for attempting &s;ome exploit, or other without in&s;ulting, or o&s;tentation: and yet remarkable to future ages: yea I prote&s;t, I thanke him: that &s;et out the di&s;cour&s;es of the <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Exchange</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tow,</HI> with their Ma&s;ters and Saylers who performed wonders, ere they could bring the &s;hips into <HI>England:</HI> and all others, that are &s;o touched with truth and de&s;ire not to let pa&s;&s;e worthy accidents, that they will pub|li&s;h hone&s;t di&s;cour&s;es, which &s;hall affoord example, or precept to idle &s;luggi&s;h men to be row&s;ed vp, and take more cheere|full cour&s;es to doe them&s;elues, and coun|try good.</P>
<P>I could name many things of wonder, and other men of worth: but that I de|termine no &s;uch heapes, nor to rai&s;e a poore <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> to &s;uch an height, that En|vies fingers &s;hall attempt to pull it downe to rubbi&s;h, or raging feete pre&s;ume to trample it to dirt: I will now onely &s;peake of a man, of whom I am acquainted with nothing but his valour, and skill in his profe&s;&s;ion, yea I am &s;o impartiall, that not
<PB N="5" REF="5">knowing any friend, or kindred belong|ing vnto him, I will yet out of meere affec|tion to vertue, and de&s;ire to worke vpon the governours of Factories, importune them to remember the liuing with re|ward, and the dead by recompencing their widdowes, and children; and intreat o|thers to endevour the immitation of well de&s;ervers, and make v&s;e of <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> &s;chol|ler&s;hip, who was &s;o inflamed with the <HI>Trophes</HI> of <HI>Miltiades,</HI> that he never de&s;i&s;ted, till he had got the reputation of a great Captaine.</P>
<P>This <HI>Andrew Shilling,</HI> of whom I would &s;peake, and am affrayd I &s;hall not &s;peake &s;ufficiently, came from all the degrees of Navall imployment to be ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, yea, of many &s;hips, till at la&s;t in the time of Sir <HI>Thomas Glover,</HI> whom ma&s;ter <HI>Clarke</HI> brought over with his Lady to <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI> he arrived there him&s;elfe with a &s;hip called the <HI>Angell,</HI> which he commanded, as mai&s;ter <HI>Tiler</HI> did the <HI>Dragon.</HI> There was al&s;o mai&s;ter <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI> at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> Captaine <HI>King</HI> at <HI>Xante,</HI> and many other well de&s;erving men at <HI>Scio, Smirna,</HI> and al the ports of the Levant
<PB N="6" REF="6">and Arches. But <HI>Shilling</HI> (without impeach|ment of the credit of others (was &s;o liked and looked vpon with the iudicious eyes of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, that they im|ployed him thither, and he imployed him|&s;elfe &s;o well, and &s;o hone&s;tly, that he di&s;|patched his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and came with Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> (who had beene <HI>Amba&s;&s;adour</HI> to the great <HI>Mogull</HI>) into <HI>England.</HI> But &s;ee, what it is to thriue? the Marchants mooving in their proper elements for obtaining of wealth, and having had &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of di&s;contentments with former Captaines, thought it not befitting to be further mo|le&s;ted, and therefore once againe made choice of ma&s;ter <HI>Shilling</HI> to goe another voyage, to which (after his accounts were rendred) he &s;o addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elfe, that he &s;carce tarried 6 weeks, but vndertooke the bu&s;ines. And in a &s;hip, called the <HI>London,</HI> was appointed Admirall of that Fleet; the Vice Admirall was the <HI>Hart:</HI> There were al&s;o two other &s;hips in the company, the <HI>Eagle</HI> and the <HI>Roe-buck,</HI> all of great burthen, and daringly able to encounter with a far grea|ter number.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>Thus &s;hall hone&s;t men be imployed, and vertue can not be poore, &s;o that whether it was their iudgement, and good husban|dry, or his wi&s;edome and care to take hold of opportunities fore-top, he thought his time well be&s;towed in growing rich, and they thought their choice very happie to make him rich, and &s;o vpon reciprocall a|greement, he tooke the Seas for <HI>Zarret</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> in the next &s;hips, that were readie after Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> came into <HI>Eng|land:</HI> and after many changes, and varietie of Accidents, boy&s;terous Seas, and moun|ting billowes, fearefull &s;tormes, and &s;ome wants, he attained the de&s;ired harbour, had not an vnde&s;ired mi&s;chance flung him downe into the harbour of death: For he peri&s;hed in the Sea by &s;laughter, which was the more lamentable, becau&s;e by his vallour and directions his Company were victors, and both brought their &s;hips to take in their lading at other places, and brought them without lo&s;&s;e into <HI>England;</HI> but that they counted the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Shilling</HI> to exceed halfe the benefit in their be&s;t fraighted &s;hip: but how this came to pa&s;&s;e?
<PB N="8" REF="7">if you will giue me leaue to write out a worthy mans Letter, I will not leaue you, till you vnder&s;tand as much as my &s;elfe.</P>
<P>After a long and tedious pa&s;&s;age by the <HI>Ilands,</HI> watring places, and <HI>Cape,</HI> we di&s;co|vered divers &s;hips, &s;ome for the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> &s;ome for the <HI>South,</HI> and many, both <HI>Flemmings</HI> and others for their Country: tho&s;e which were remote we never attended, &s;uch as came within kenning had friendly &s;aluta|tions, and many times when we encoun|tred with &s;ome friends, extraordinary gu&s;ts, and foggy mi&s;ts did divide vs, which being v&s;uall, and the common effect of long iourneyes, we neither wondred at the &s;ame, nor tarried for further encom|brances: but came in convenient time to S. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and from thence keeping the common road, we arrived happily at <HI>Za|retta,</HI> and yet I cannot call it &s;o, becau&s;e of &s;ome di&s;a&s;trous mi&s;chiefe which hapned vnto vs, and although it was a common thing to encounter with daily mi&s;chances, from tempe&s;ts, enemies, and Pyrats, which were all as ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed over, as &s;uddenly came vpon vs: yet at this time our lo&s;&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="7">and griefe was the greater, becau&s;e we had not only a wealthy &s;hip in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but a valiant Captaine to manage our af|faires, both which we lo&s;t to our great di&s;|comforts, when the malignity of time was overcome with indu&s;try, and our enemies departed from vs beaten and di&s;comfited.</P>
<P>Know then, that we haue not had long trade in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> till of late &s;ending euery yeere a &s;hip, we acquainted our &s;elues with the inhabitants of <HI>Ia&s;ques</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;i|an Gulph,</HI> and &s;o proceeded with them in orderly traffique, both to their &s;atisfaction, &amp; enriching our Marchants, which when the <HI>Portingalis</HI> vnder&s;tood, they contrived by all po&s;&s;ible meanes to intercept our ior|neyes, which they performed both by &s;e|cret plots, and con&s;piracie, and open force, and defiances. Concerning the plots they inferred many things again&s;t vs to the peo|ple, and kindled a kind of reciprocall iea|lou&s;ie betweene vs: they inticed vs a&s;hore, vnder cullour of viewing &s;tuffs, and com|modities, and then &s;urpri&s;ed vs, taking ma|ny pri&s;oners by divers &s;leights, and v&s;ing vs vnkindly, when they had vs vnder &s;ub|iection.
<PB N="10" REF="8">Concerning their force and pow|er, they alwayes had fiue or &s;ixe great <HI>Gal|lions,</HI> and &s;hippes of warre belonging to <HI>Spaine,</HI> &amp; imploied for the &s;ecuritie of the&s;e places, and at this in&s;tant, had foure well appointed &s;hips in readines, who lay wat|ching for our Marchant, as a Hawke ho|uering ouer the prey, and &s;o re&s;olved to take it, who&s;oeuer it was: all which was con&s;idered of vs in our pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that whe~ we were within 40, or 50. leagues of <HI>Zar|ret</HI> a <HI>Councell</HI> of warre was called, and <HI>An|drew Shilling</HI> being our <HI>Admirall,</HI> and Com|maunder of our &s;mall Fleet, concluded to &s;end the <HI>Hart</HI> being <HI>vice-Admirall,</HI> and the <HI>Eagle</HI> to <HI>Ia&s;ques</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;o according to our ceremonies, they tooke their leaue of vs, before we came to <HI>Zarret,</HI> and wee went directly to harbour, wher we might haue beene welcommed with all the comforts of friendly greetings, had not the Marchants vnder&s;tood, what we had done, but apprehen&s;iue of the danger, they would not &s;uffer vs to land, but &s;ent vs pre&s;ently after the other to a&s;&s;i&s;t them: for they knewe, they &s;hould bee fought
<PB N="11" REF="8">with all, if not over-&s;et: it was not our turnes to di&s;pute, nor had we any other part to play but obedience, and &s;o wee put to Sea againe, taking a cour&s;e to fol|low our &s;hipps.</P>
<P>But we had not beene two dayes vnder &s;ayle, before wee encountred a <HI>Portingall</HI> of 300. tunne, which at fir&s;t made good &s;emblance of <HI>oppo&s;ition,</HI> till wearied with our &s;hott, and beaten with a broad &s;ide, &s;hee yeelded her &s;elfe, and wee tooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her: her Marchandi&s;e was but Rai&s;ons, and Dates, and fortie two <HI>Arabian</HI> hor&s;es: yet were they worth &s;tore of money, and might haue made vs a &s;a|ving iourney.</P>
<P>This &s;hipp wee carried along with vs thus fraighted, and &s;ayled a fortnight without any impeachment, or adventure, till at la&s;t by Gods eternall providence, we met our two &s;hips returning home againe to <HI>Zarret,</HI> as not able to encounter with the <HI>Portingals,</HI> who&s;e &s;trength and prepara|tion they reported extraordinary: But the truth is, they were very rich them&s;elues, and loath to loo&s;e al by any mi&s;adventure,
<PB N="12" REF="9">which they might e&s;cape, and not wil|fully run into: and yet I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e, they had many motiues to fight with them, &amp; daring heartes to the encounter: For all their great burthen, and preparation, wel? they did not? but returned (as I &s;ayd) and met vs at Sea, di&s;cour&s;ing at large of the matter, and de&s;cribing the maner of the Enemies watches, and how brauely and warlike they were appointed: When <HI>Andrew Shilling</HI> had heard them out, and ap|prehended the vtmo&s;t perill, hee re&s;olved to trie his Fortune, and &s;et vpon them, proiecting, that if the wor&s;t came, the <HI>Por|tingall</HI> &s;hip formerly taken, &s;hould be fiered, and thru&s;t to them, which when &s;ome in|terpo&s;ed, as pittying the lo&s;&s;e of &s;o many braue hor&s;es, he as brauely replyed, how doe they then in the wars, when they are compelled to kill their pri&s;oners in colde blood, and therefore thinke neither of &s;cruple, or nicety, but let vs follow the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, we take in hand.</P>
<P>Thus we concluded to fight, and &s;o be|fitting our &s;elues, approched them on the harbour of <HI>Ia&s;ques</HI> on a &s;atterday, being
<PB N="13" REF="9">about the 17. of <HI>December</HI> 1620 and within eight dayes of <HI>Chri&s;tmas:</HI> and &s;o without more adoe we came vp with them, and to them, but the wind being contrary, we could not fight with them in harbour, nor they dur&s;t not &s;tirre as we imagined, wher|vpon we de&s;i&s;ted for that time, &amp; woond our &s;elues away, as if we meant not to fight at all, which que&s;tionles did much animate them, and made them &s;uppo&s;e, that our former de&s;i&s;ting and recoyling a|ro&s;e out of &s;u&s;pition of their greatnes, and power; For the next day being Sunday, they came out of the road, and in a braving and daring maner invited vs to an encoun|ter, which we intertained with many Na|vall ceremonies, and putting out our cul|lours of defiance, with the adorning our &s;hips to an&s;were their proportion of Gal|lantne&s;&s;e, we made a braue &s;how, as if we meant to intertaine death and &s;laughter with mirth and iollitie.</P>
<P>In a word, the Drums &amp; Trumpets &s;um|mon vs, &amp; we went chearfully to the bu&s;i|nes: Our fight began at eight of the clocke in the morning, and continued to night,
<PB N="14" REF="10">when the darknes tooke either pitty vpon vs, or by way of oppo&s;ition &s;tomached our light: For many times we made fire workes, &amp; &s;hot flaming arrowes into their &s;hips, we al&s;o threw burning balls, and &s;ent ca&s;es full of &s;tones, which killed their men without mercy: we al&s;o &s;hot off their <HI>Admiralls</HI> rudder, that they were enfore&s;t to come to Anchor, and repaire their lo&s;&s;es, which as it &s;hould &s;eeme were very great, and &s;o the fight continued fearefully be|tweene vs.</P>
<P>In a word, &s;uch was the terror and dan|gerous encounter, that although Captaine <HI>Shilling</HI> our <HI>Admirall</HI> with all the good words, and better actions, which belon|ged to a principall commander, &s;till com|forted vs, and as farre as men might con|iecture, warranted our prevailing at this time: yet Captaine <HI>Be&s;t</HI> his &s;onne, whom they call <HI>Generall</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> taking hold of our fir&s;t determination to &s;et fire on the Portingall in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with the hor&s;es, put it pre&s;ently in practi&s;e, when there was neither rea&s;on nor cau&s;e, and when he was furthe&s;t from all perill,
<PB N="15" REF="10">and mi&s;chiefe: as we thought we had in|deed fitted and appointed her to fire, but how? in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;itie, which as yet came not vpon vs, nor was there any like|lihood more then the chance of encoun|ters, and fortune of warre to de&s;parire of prevailing. Well; he tooke out as many things as he thought convenient, leaving mo&s;t part of the Dates and Rai&s;ons in her, and leaving vs in kinde of confu&s;ion to &s;ee &s;o many goodly hor&s;es peri&s;h in the ra|ging Sea, and &s;o to all our griefes &s;he was fired, and thru&s;t vp to &s;trike among&s;t the Portingalls, with &s;uppo&s;ition either to de|&s;troy them, or di&s;&s;ipate them: But alas all was in vaine, for either the bu&s;ines was ill managed, or the Wind &s;lacked her cour&s;e, or &s;omething or other was ami&s;&s;e; for &s;he went not forward, but peri&s;hed in her flames and combu&s;tion before vs all, effec|ting no more good, then a generall ca&s;ting vp the account of the Accident, wherevn|to life is &s;ubiect, and a particular examina|tion of our owne e&s;tates, which might be &s;ubiect to the &s;ame inconveniences. But to goe forward.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="11">
<P>I mu&s;t needs confe&s;&s;e that if it had plea|&s;ed the Captaine, &s;eeing he was &s;o re&s;olved, he might haue come nearer and thru&s;t her vp more clo&s;er vpon them to their preiu|dice, and firing indeed; but failing, and thus di&s;appointed, our fight continued longer, and (as I &s;aid) the very night tooke pittie vpon vs, and divided vs, in which darknes they went away into harbour, and being wonderfully torne with our &s;hot, and di&s;|membred with cro&s;&s;e barres, thought it be&s;t to repaire their &s;hips againe, and pro|vide more men to &s;et vpon vs afre&s;h. The truth is, we let them alone, and gaue way to their good husbandry, anchoring our &s;elues in harbour, and preparing to goe a|bout our marchandice, and &s;et forward our traffique. But on a &s;udden, within 3. or 4. dayes vnexpected, they came out of the road, &amp; braved vs againe, which when our Captaine <HI>Shilling</HI> perceived, we al&s;o perceived in him, (which we never did before) very fignes of di&s;content, as if they were pre&s;agers of &s;ome mi&s;chiefe to fol|low; For though the valiant man was vn|daunted, yet as it happens in &s;uch ca&s;es of
<PB N="17" REF="11">&s;u&s;pition, anger, and revenge, he thus ven|ted out his griefe, as a <HI>Complainant</HI> again&s;t the <HI>malignitie</HI> of time, and over-&s;ights of en|counters.</P>
<P>I &s;ee (quoth he (that in al expeditions op|portunity is not to be neglected, but &s;hee taketh it in &s;corne, that when &s;he openeth her lap, we refu&s;e her bounty and kindnes: &s;o that if we had followed our fortune la&s;t day, and not &s;uffered the&s;e men to haue breathed in the meditation of revenge, &amp; gone foreward in their reparations, wee had ended the bu&s;ines: but now they haue not onely got new breath, but new cou|rages, and will returne vpon vs with grea|ter fury and mi&s;chiefe: Be&s;ides there are &s;everall vertues, which are vn&s;ea&s;onable in their practi&s;e, &s;uch as wee call pitty, com|mi&s;eration, and patience, all good for no|thing in the&s;e warlike trials, and among pollitick and cruel adver&s;aries, but to draw on heavier burthens, and make vs &s;ubiect to fearefull inconveniences; wherefore if I liue, I will never bee guilty of this errour againe, and if I dye, I leaue it to you all as a <HI>principle,</HI> neuer to &s;lacke you hand, if you
<PB N="18" REF="12">finde the enemy &s;taggering, neuer to giue ouer, till you haue made a faire <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> or di&s;patched the bu&s;ines. But come? &s;ee|ing we mu&s;t fight, let vs doe it couragiou&s;|ly? that the&s;e <HI>Portingals</HI> (with many pre&s;i|dents of former times) may confe&s;&s;e, they haue met with <HI>Engli&s;h-men.</HI></P>
<P>After this briefe and pithy complaint, we prepared our &s;elues, and on <HI>Childermas</HI> day our <HI>Admirall</HI> came and anchored by their &s;ides, whom the <HI>Vice-Admirall</HI> followed, &amp; did the like: the other two &s;hipps being &s;maller, &amp; of weaker &s;ayle, the winde &s;ma|ly helping them, could not come fore|ward, &amp; &s;o we were compelled with the <HI>London,</HI> and the <HI>Hart</HI> to make a triall with al the 4. great <HI>Portingals,</HI> which we did in &s;uch a maner, that I prote&s;t (if I might &s;cape vaine glory or partialitie) neuer was &s;uch a fight &s;o wel begun, nor better continued; for we tore them all to peices, and kild &s;o many men, that they could &s;carce get away from vs, nor had e&s;caped peri&s;hing all, if mi&s;chance had not checked our forward|nes, and moderated our in&s;ulting with the greate&s;t lo&s;&s;e, that we thought we could
<PB N="19" REF="12">receiue; for in the mid&s;t of the conflict, while we were wrapped in &s;moake, and &s;weating in blood, a cro&s;&s;e &s;hot cro&s;t vs all, and &s;lue our <HI>Captaine:</HI> yea he peri&s;hed in the mid&s;t of our triumphs, when wee had but &s;ixe men &s;laine, and very few to &s;peake of, hurt.</P>
<P><HI>Andrew Shilling</HI> peri&s;hed, when we by his valour pro&s;pred, and thought to haue gone cleere away with the Victory. <HI>Andrew Shil|ling</HI> peri&s;hed to our di&s;con&s;olation, &amp; abate|ment of ioy when we thought of nothing but prevailing: but Wi&s;edome was at la&s;t predominant, and in remediles ca&s;es we ca&s;t vp another account of reclaiming our &s;elues, and tempring the &s;orrow, &s;o that we were once againe divided, and the <HI>Portin|galls</HI> mo&s;t gladly and cunningly departed from vs, and when they were out of &s;ight we gaue God the pray&s;e for our delive|rance, and divided the &s;orrow for our <HI>Cap|taines</HI> lo&s;&s;e among&s;t vs, not a man but be|moaned his death; not a man but partici|pated with his vertues; not a man but was the better for his in&s;tructions; not a man but wondred at his experience and skill in
<PB N="20" REF="13">Navigation; not a man but lamented his vntimely death; not a man but extolled his timely worthine&s;&s;e, and &s;o with one con|&s;ent, he was buried with all the Ceremo|nies of a <HI>Generall,</HI> and ca&s;t out of &s;ight for feare of troubling vs further, and rai&s;ing new exta&s;ies to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;econd encounter was more for|midable then the fir&s;t, and continued lon|ger, but ended (thanks be to God) as you haue heard to our &s;mall detriment at this time, whereby we went forward in our bu&s;ines, and were well-commed to <HI>Ia&s;ques</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to advance our traffique. But how many were &s;laine of our enemies we know not, onely we know, their &s;hips were made vn&s;erviceable for the pre&s;ent, and report (when we were &s;etled in har|bour) a&s;&s;ured vs, that they lo&s;t 370. Portin|galls, be&s;ides Moores and Negroes, of whom they make no account, as being their &s;laues, and &s;o &s;ubiect to all ba&s;ene&s;&s;e, pro&s;titution, and carele&s;ne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>I could enlarge this Letter with many oc|currences in our Voyage, both tending to navigatio~ &amp; di&s;cour&s;e, but when our good
<PB N="21" REF="13">&s;hip called the <HI>Hart</HI> commeth into <HI>England,</HI> there are tho&s;e in her, that will truely and heartily tell you, all you de&s;ire, and more then I am acquainted with: onely I can a&s;&s;ure you, our trade thriues, and we haue 1200. tunne of lading readie at <HI>Zarret,</HI> but the <HI>Portingals</HI> grow &s;tronger, and &s;tronger, and prepare them&s;elues to intercept our &s;hips both in the way of revenge, for their former lo&s;&s;es, and out of covetuou&s;nes and glory to enrich them&s;elues, and performe &s;ome worthy exploit vpon vs; for they heare of our preparation, and know of our riches, which hath made them (as I &s;ayd) prepare a greater Fleete, and maketh vs a&s;&s;ured, there is nothing to be expected but encounters and &s;laughters, blood and death, happen when it will and to whom it &s;hall.</P>
<P>This Letter was written from <HI>Swallo Road,</HI> neere <HI>Zarret</HI> the 20. of <HI>November,</HI> 1621. and brought into <HI>England</HI> with the la&s;t &s;hipps, that came in the beginning of <HI>Iune,</HI> to the comforting of many &s;ad hearts, &amp; recoue|ring the &s;taggering opinio~ of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indiaes</HI> companies thriuing, fro~ whence I prote&s;t I
<PB N="22" REF="14">haue extracted nothing but the truth, and if I by way of illu&s;tration or amplificatio~, there are &s;ome things added in the pray&s;e of the man: Oh, let vertue haue this pa&s;|&s;age among&s;t you, that it is a glory to all <HI>Common-wealths,</HI> neither to ob&s;cure her, as &s;he is of a durable e&s;&s;ence and exi&s;tence, nor to be forgetfull of her &s;ervants, as they are worthie of commemoration, and well de&s;erving in their &s;everall places, wherein God hath be|&s;towed them.</P>
