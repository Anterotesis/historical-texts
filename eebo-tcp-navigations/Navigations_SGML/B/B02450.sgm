<P><HI>I</HI> Have offer'd you this Book without the Commands of any Per&s;on of Quality, or the ur|gent de&s;ires of any Friend, only for my own Plea&s;ure, and perhaps a little for my Profit; be&s;ides, I think it a plea&s;ant thing, though I &s;hall not im|po&s;e this Opinion on any one, nor think my &s;elf oblig'd to him who favours it; do but buy it, and let the Book&s;eller take your money; then Cur&s;e it, Damn it, and the Author, throw it away, or what you plea&s;e. Nor have I omitted
<PB REF="5">my Name for fear of the Criticks, who I de&s;ire to have no more mercy on the Book, when once bought, than they have of their own unpitied Souls, who likely they may damn, by way of af|firming the poor ignorant Author for a Blockhead, a Dunce, and Fool, with a long <HI>Et caetera</HI> of their ironical Ti|tles; a thing that he'll but &s;mile to hear, &s;o that his Expectations are but an&s;wer'd, and the Book &s;ells: And though likely you may be one of this ungrateful Gang; yet however, I will &s;peak &s;o much, and for the better un|der&s;tanding of it as I think conveni|ent; partly to &s;atisfie you in &s;ome particulars, but more for my own &s;a|tisfaction: I mu&s;t tell you, the Scene being in <HI>Spain,</HI> I have been feign to give them Foreign Characters, al|though the Haughtine&s;s of the Spani&s;h

<HEAD>Li&s;arda; OR, THE TRAVELS OF Love and Jealou&s;y.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CLara Li&s;arda,</HI> a Lady but of &s;ixteen years of Age, Beauti|ful, Di&s;creet, and one that had &s;ixteen thou&s;and Dollars for a Portion; was born in <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> of Illu&s;trious Parents: Now the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors of Youth and Riches we know are never homely, e&s;pecially the lat|ter is &s;o attractive a Virtue, that that it &s;elf is capable to gild all Im|perfections;
<PB N="2" REF="7">&s;o that you need not que&s;tion the number of Pretenders to this Lady, being every way well qualified; but however, amid&s;t the throng of her Adorers, there was not one could rea&s;onably think him&s;elf in a higher place of her regard than another; &s;he was civil to them all, nor was there any one of them, that ever pretended to her, but hop'd with the re&s;t; however &s;he carried her &s;elf with &s;uch indifference, that none could complain, nor envy ano|ther; yet with all young Women &s;he very much de&s;ir'd the happy hour, that might perfect her frame, and &s;atisfie a certain de&s;ire of &s;ome|thing nature did dictate to her, for which end a thou&s;and hovering thoughts advertis'd her, &s;he was born, and that without this (&s;he knew not what) &s;he &s;hould never be happy: a thou&s;and wi&s;hes and de|&s;ires, Curio&s;ity it &s;elf urging her to ha&s;te the experiment of Joys, &s;poke to be &s;o great, that the mo&s;t copious
<PB N="3" REF="7">Language is too &s;canty to expre&s;s. She many times would alone, at that in&s;tant, when each little <HI>Fibre</HI> of her Soul &s;hot forth, warm'd by that ver|nal Sun that &s;till invites tho&s;e of her tender years to new-born Appetites, di&s;creetly rea&s;on in the following manner.</P>
<P><HI>Who is it can penetrate the heart and thoughts of Man, being &s;o various, that the di&s;po&s;itions of mo&s;t are changed as often as they change their Company; and yet as uncertain as their humours are, &s;o certain is it my years require me to ac|cept of one for a Husband? What &s;hall I do then? &s;hall I plunge my &s;elf into life-la&s;ting Mi&s;eries to gratifie my wi&s;hes, and plea&s;e my Parents?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Two things there are to invite Preten|ders, my Per&s;on, or my E&s;tate; My Per&s;on, No. It is not that; for I know many in this City, if not more No|ble, yet far beyond me in Perfections; and becau&s;e they are poor, Lovers are not only wanting, but even tho&s;e that in je&s;t &s;hould offer Marriage. Why then, if
<PB N="4" REF="8">'tis my Portion does the&s;e wonders, I find it hard to marry a Man who wooes not me but my E&s;tate; and yet could I bear with this, (for Ambition is &s;o grown into the World, that there mu&s;t be a new Creation to find di&s;intere&s;s'd men:) who can a&s;&s;ure their &s;elves of their manners, where there are &s;o many Cheats. In the time of wooing the mo&s;t vicious appears a Saint, and dete&s;ts all Vice: with what prote&s;tations doth the incon&s;tant at that time avouch his Constancy? and how a&s;|&s;ured of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Vertue is the Gal|lant, when many times afterwards, he proves murderou&s;ly trouble&s;ome with his Jealou&s;y; and all, how fal&s;e &s;oever, call Heaven to witne&s;s the &s;incerity of their Love: O! how they Adore, Admire, E&s;teem, with many other &s;uch like terms, till they have got their aim. His Friend &s;tiles him vertuous, good,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>His Re|lations will &s;ay that for him, He is good natur'd, and given to no remarkable Vice; another as a gallant young Gen|tleman; Nay the Maid, the young La|dies Confident, hath had the itching of
<PB N="5" REF="8">her Palms an&s;wer'd, to give her good word, and all this to her co&s;t, who takes him for better and for wor&s;e; and gives her hand and heart to an Enemy, who either impairs the E&s;tate by Gaming, or proves very ill humour'd, or what is wor&s;e, grows weary of the Per&s;on that adores him; &s;o oppo&s;ite are the humours of many Men to rea&s;on, that they never love le&s;s than when they are most be|lov'd: thus it is with us poor Women, who fill'd with hopes of continued un|&s;peakable Joys, many times throw our &s;elves into continued and unexpre&s;&s;ible Mi&s;eries. Suffer it not, O Heavens! De&s;ire it not, O Parents! For rather will I end this Life by a draught of Poy|&s;on, or Poniard, than marry, without making, not only for Months, but for Years, a &s;ufficient Enquiry into the Man|ners of him who is to be my Husband.</HI></P>
<P>Thus rea&s;on'd our di&s;creet young Lady, and thus re&s;olv'd not to mar|ry; yet lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould erre in her Election, or rather becau&s;e Love was but ju&s;t conceiv'd in her Maiden
<PB N="6" REF="9">Brea&s;t, and had not yet &s;trength ca|pable of any more than directing that little Affection (&s;he thought Friend&s;hip) to <HI>Ricardo Antonio,</HI> a Gentleman &s;o well accompli&s;ht, and of &s;o great Parts, that in the judg|ment of the whole City, he was only worthy to be <HI>Li&s;arda</HI>'s Husband, and &s;he only de&s;erving to be his Bride. At this time the City was oblig'd to Fea&s;ts, in that to &s;hew their Joy for the Union between the two Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> Exchanging the two Beautiful Prince&s;&s;es <HI>I&s;abel</HI> and <HI>Juana,</HI> that with the tie of affinity their Friend&s;hip might be la&s;ting. The Fea&s;ts were &s;o much the richer, fora&s;much as all the Rival-Servants of our Lady, with Emulation, &s;et them&s;elves forth, without regard of Expences; &s;o that for many days were great Bonefires, Balls, Masks, and to end this Solemnity, there were prepar'd twelve Bulls of the large&s;t &s;ize; this is a &s;port that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> extremely delights in. <HI>Ri|cardo</HI>

'Twas now Love was re&s;olv'd to dally no longer, and took this occa&s;ion to make <HI>Li|&s;arda</HI> know, that even &s;he with all her Charms, could not with&s;tand his Plea&s;ure; for now, though &s;he knew not why &s;he &s;hould be more con|cern'd for <HI>Ricardo</HI> than for the re&s;t of his Competitors; but willing to deceive her &s;elf (a frailty common to humane nature) &s;he fan&s;ied it only a tender Friend&s;hip. She was &s;o griev'd and unea&s;y, that &s;he became re&s;tle&s;s. A terrible Bull was let loo&s;e into the Li&s;ts, when, according to Cu&s;tom, the People gave a &s;hout, which &s;o angred the haughty Animal, that ca&s;ting his fiery Eyes on <HI>Fulgen|cio,

<P>When this Letter came to <HI>Ricardo</HI> by a continued thought of what had pa&s;t, he had arrived almo&s;t to the height of de&s;pair, Cur&s;ing him&s;elf, and the hour he fir&s;t &s;aw <HI>Li&s;arda,</HI> and as the Servant knockt at the Door, he had ju&s;t drawn a Poniard, with in|tention to have ended his Life, but hearing &s;ome body at the door, he &s;topt and li&s;ten'd, knowing the Ser|vants Voice, him&s;elf ran, and the Servant deliver'd into his own hand the Letter, which he retired to read bidding the Servant wait an An&s;wer. A thou&s;and thoughts pe&s;ter'd him, he knew not what to make of the Letter; the Directions he knew to be <HI>Li&s;arda</HI>'s writing, but never ha|ving receiv'd, nor heard &s;he had ever writ to any of her Lovers before, he conjectur'd it was to di&s;card him:

This now pa&s;t for granted, and he was re&s;olv'd not to open the Letter, lea&s;t it might draw Effeminate tears into his Eyes, there|fore retaking his Poniard, he &s;aid, Come welcome &s;teel, thy &s;harpne&s;s is much ea&s;ier to be endur'd, than to &s;ee the happine&s;s of my Rival; End my Mi&s;ery; and as he was going to &s;trike, &s;ays he, No. Though thy Charms hath made me mi&s;erable to that degree, that to avoid that &s;uc|ceeding Chain of Mi&s;eries that mu&s;t needs follow, I will end my life.

She really lov'd <HI>Ricardo,</HI> and her Love urged her to be the &s;everer, nor would &s;he hear him &s;peak, but threatned to tear <HI>Li&s;arda</HI> to pieces; this urg'd <HI>Ricardo</HI> to think of another cour&s;e, &s;o that &s;aying nothing, he went &s;treight to the Corregidors, or Gover|nour of the Town who was his Kin&s;|man, and one that really lov'd him, to him he told the whole affair, and de&s;ired his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to get rid of her, which he promis'd; then they a|greed, that the en&s;uing night, about eleven a Clock, the Corrigidor

<P>THE Corregidor daily vi&s;ited <HI>Ricardo Antonio,</HI> who though his Wounds were by the di|ligence of Skilful Surgeons almo&s;t heal'd, yet none under&s;tanding his
<PB N="46" REF="30">continued Di&s;temper, nor the means to heal his Heart, he was of a brisk Gallant Man, become extreamly the Contrary; full of thought, and often di&s;cour&s;ing and muttering to him|&s;elf, that the Corregidor extreamly fear'd Madne&s;s might be the Con&s;e|quence of his re&s;tle&s;s Mind; and therefore by all means endeavour'd to recreate him; but this augmented his unea&s;ine&s;s, by adding to his grief &s;uch things as he &s;hunn'd; therefore being wholly Cur'd of his Wounds, he re&s;olv'd by travel, thinking <HI>Li|&s;arda</HI> lo&s;t, to get rid of his Cordial, though trouble&s;ome Friends; and to this purpo&s;e, he, with all privacy, got things in a readine&s;s, and in the dusk|i&s;h of the Evening rid out of Town, and in &s;hort time arriv'd at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and finding an opportunity to Em|barque, aboard the Gallies of the Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> who were up|on their return; before he Embark'd, by Letters he acquainted his Friends of his health, and taking Bills of Ex|change
<PB N="47" REF="30">for <HI>Rome,</HI> he &s;et forward.</P>
<P>He acquainted the Captain of the Gally who he was, who treated him with all the Re&s;pect due to a Per&s;on of his Merit, and order'd his Lodg|ing in the great Cabbin; where he endeavour'd to divert him&s;elf with the Lecture of &s;ome Books he had bought to that purpo&s;e at <HI>Barcelona;</HI> there was al&s;o lodg'd another Gentle|man near <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who&s;e Pen&s;ivene&s;s and Melancholy, occa&s;ion'd <HI>Ricardo</HI> to take notice of him, and made him de&s;irous to know the cau&s;e of his Sad|ne&s;s; &s;ometimes he was &s;een to lift up his Eyes to Heaven, at other times was heard to &s;igh and Cur&s;e his ad|ver&s;e Fortune.

<PB N="48" REF="31">Sir, though you are a &s;tranger to me, the trouble I perceive you lie under has ex|treamly di&s;turb'd me; for 'tis not a &s;mall Portion of Pity that &s;hould be be&s;tow'd on &s;o worthy a Gentleman under Affliction, which truly if I could any way remedy, I would willingly adventure my Life to ob|tain your quiet; and in travelling many times are knit the &s;tricte&s;t bonds of Friend&s;hip: Pardon me, (my own Con|dition &s;omewhat re&s;embling yours, in that I al&s;o am under very unea&s;y Circum&s;tan|ces) if I de&s;ire that we may for the time to come, be pair'd in the happy number of Friends; and therefore hoping your bounty will not refu&s;e my de&s;ire, I am willing to relate to you my Misfortunes, which I believe, if they are not greater, they may equal yours; hoping al&s;o that you'll pay me in the &s;ame Coin.</HI></P>
<P>Extreamly plea&s;ed was the Melan|choly Gentleman, with the courte|ous offers of <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who de&s;ir'd not to wonder that he of him&s;elf &s;hould relate a misfortune, that ought to be for his honour kept private from all

<PB N="50" REF="32">my Quality of the Mo&s;t Illu&s;trious in that State; my E&s;tate, though not of the large&s;t, yet enough; and my Age thirty four Years: There dwelt in the very next Hou&s;e to my Fathers, a young Lady, whom I lov'd as I grew in &s;en&s;e and years, beginning from my Childhood: I mi&s;take, I &s;hould &s;ay ador'd; for 'tis more than love, not to be &s;aid to live out of her &s;ight. Our Parents were intimate Friends, and &s;o our Acquaintance and Intima|cy was the le&s;s noted by the Neigh|bours, or &s;candaliz'd by the Envious. I will not tire you with the account of my Endeavours to plea&s;e and gain that amiable Creature, that would be to tire you, as al&s;o refre&s;h my Mind, and make me &s;uffer a &s;econd Martyrdom; but in &s;hort, I'll &s;ay no Art, no Indu&s;try, no Zeal, can ever &s;econd mine to <HI>Donna E&s;tefania,</HI> for &s;o is &s;he nam'd, who by her In|gratitude hath caus'd my Mi&s;ery; It will be enough to &s;ay we were both Children, our Loves great, her Beauty
<PB N="51" REF="32">va&s;t, and her behaviour at that time exceeding Mode&s;t, very Witty, and con&s;equently well di&s;cours'd; our op|portunity did not a little encrea&s;e our Flames, for with the leave of our Parents, we at any time might &s;ee each other; and indeed &s;eldom was it we were a &s;under; by which our Parents perceiving our de&s;ires, con|firm'd their Friend&s;hip by affinity, Marrying us both very young; who yet for all that, in our de&s;ires had been long wedded. Whoever &s;ay that Marriage gluts, and con&s;equently impairs Love, certainly mu&s;t be &s;uch dull Souls, who more like Brutes than Men, are but &s;atisfying their &s;en&s;ual Appetite, while I'm &s;ure all refin'd Spirits, who by the continual Enjoy|ment, have daily the Experiments of the Wit, the Mode&s;ty, the Love, the plea&s;ing Behaviour, affording daily fre&s;h &s;upplies to edge his Appetite, though her Beauty &s;hould dimini&s;h, and though I cannot pretend to more than ju&s;t a rea&s;onable Man, yet like

But to tell the &s;tory of my Misfor|tune, Heaven having given me a Son, no le&s;s Beautiful than Witty, and ha|ving &s;een him brought up with all the Accompli&s;hments his Age was ca|pable of; and &s;ince I could not leave him a larger E&s;tate, I was de&s;irous to better it by a Title to &s;ome Habit; and advis'd with my Wife, who &s;aid &s;o much, and &s;eem'd &s;o eagerly to regret my ab&s;ence for the time re|quir'd to procure it at Court, that I even repented my &s;elf of the thought;

<PB N="55" REF="34">change of the Weather, from a fine clear Day to a very &s;tormy Even|ing, oblig'd me to put into an Inne but two Leagues di&s;tant from my abode; where while I was re&s;ting my &s;elf, and ordering &s;omething for Supper, there came in a Gentleman, who by his Mein and Garb, I gue&s;t to be of Quality; but he was &s;o wet, that I was oblig'd, although I did not know him, to offer him my Servants to un|dre&s;s him and help to dry his Cloaths; and told him, if he pleas'd to accom|pany me at my Table, I &s;hould e&s;teem the Favour, and that he might al&s;o lodge with me: <HI>Don Federico</HI> thankt me (for &s;o was his Name;) and af|ter Supper, we pa&s;s'd an hour or two in relating Stories and &s;everal other Matters: In which di&s;cour&s;e he &s;hew'd much Judgment, &s;peaking excellent Sen&s;e, and withal very chearful and witty.

<P>The Night is &s;uch, &s;aid I, (not dreaming of my Misfortune) that it would have been a Misfortune to the Lady, had you got thither; for I fear you are not in the be&s;t Condi|tion to Content her.

<PB N="57" REF="35">Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;o unwilling to dive further into the Matter before them, I &s;taid till we were in Bed, and they had lock'd the Doors and were gone; but no &s;ooner did I &s;ee our &s;elves a|lone, but with as impertinent a Cu|rio&s;ity, as malicious, and de&s;ignedly to know the Lady's Name, I told him, I thought no Name in <HI>Spain</HI> un|fortunate, becau&s;e they are Names of Saints that are always given in <HI>Spain.</HI> To this he an&s;wer'd, That ever &s;ince in <HI>Castile</HI> there was a Lady named <HI>Estefania,</HI> who was kill'd by her Hu&s;|band, without ever offending him, only by the deceit of a Servant, That it was a vulgar Attribute of the <HI>Este|fania's</HI> to be unfortunate. According to this your Lady is called <HI>E&s;tefania</HI> &s;aid I, a little altered: And he an|&s;wer'd, Having told you the Story fir&s;t, it would be a folly to think to hide her Name now: So craving leave to &s;leep, he turn'd him&s;elf, and left me not altogether free from a vil|lainous &s;u&s;picion of being Horn'd:
<PB REF="36">But however, when I repre&s;ented to my &s;elf all the Letters of <HI>E&s;tefania</HI>'s De&s;ire of my Return, her continual Love to me, her mode&s;t Behaviour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I thought it a madne&s;s to think her fal&s;e, whom I &s;uppos'd as pure as Ve&s;tal Virgins, except in the Obliga|tion of Matrimony, and &s;o per&s;waded my &s;elf in the City there might be others of the Name. It was hardly Day when I gave <HI>Federico</HI> the Good|morrow, asking him if he would ri&s;e to go into the City, that we might be there before Noon; and becau&s;e he told me, that his Affairs requir'd him to &s;tay till Night, and &s;o I might go alone, and that afterwards he would enquire for me: But to tell you the Truth, my De&s;ire was to be &s;atisfied in my Mind, and to know who this <HI>E&s;tefania</HI> was that he Gal|lanted; &s;o that I told him, that I would &s;tay al&s;o and go along with him. He attributed this to Cour|te&s;ie and Affection, which indeed was Doubt and Jealou&s;ie. We re|turned
<PB N="59" REF="36">to the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e that we had before, and I offer'd my Service to him, if there were any Danger in the Atchievement of his Love. He thankt me, and told me there was no Danger, for though I have &s;everal Nights been within the Hou&s;e, yet I have not &s;een the Street, nor out|ward Walls, nor could I find the Hou&s;e, though I endeavour'd it, &s;uch has been the Care and Secrecy of the Owner.

I pray'd her, &s;ince I was confident her Ingenuity could not be wanting to find a means of our &s;eeing one another without gi|ving her the trouble of coming out of her Hou&s;e; at fir&s;t &s;he made &s;ome Difficulty, but Love, according to the <HI>Latin</HI> Phra&s;e, <HI>Overcomes all things,</HI> made her at la&s;t agree to it, but on condition I &s;hould behave my &s;elf

<P>Here <HI>Federico</HI> put an end to his Story, and I remain'd confirm'd in the Opinion of my Di&s;grace, and yet I had &s;ome Place to doubt it, becau&s;e all he had &s;aid was Ambiguous, and might &s;erve for &s;ome other unfortu|nate; but &s;uch delight he took in the relation of it, that he told &s;o many Circum&s;tances and &s;igns of the Hou&s;e, as of the Beds, Cabinets, Hangings, and particularizing &s;ome Pieces of rare Paintings, of which I have ma|ny, (being a great Admirer of them) of the Hands of all the mo&s;t famous Arti&s;ts, by which I was a&s;&s;ur'd my Hou&s;e was the abus'd; and therefore
<PB N="64" REF="39">di&s;&s;embling the Matter as much as I could, becau&s;e about Four in the Af|ternoon we mounted our Hor&s;es, and began our Journey towards the Town, he &s;till telling what Plea&s;ures he hop'd, and as it were each Word &s;tabbed me to the Heart, for &s;o doth every Injury done to my Honour reach the tendere&s;t part about me; but I when I &s;aw my &s;elf on the Road, was not &s;o careful of any thing as to watch a convenient time, if not to Cure, at lea&s;t to Revenge my Ho|nour by his Death: Therefore I or|der'd my Servants to make ha&s;te be|fore us to tell my infamous Wife of my coming: At the cro&s;&s;ing of a very thick Wood, where for many Years the Branches of the Trees hid the Roots from the heat of the Sun, I drew my Sword and gave him &s;o &s;trong a thru&s;t through the Brea&s;t, that without &s;peaking he fell on the Ground, where lighting from my Hor&s;e I gave him many Blows, that in a &s;hort time I put him pa&s;t offend|ing

<P>MY Preten&s;ions to <HI>Donna Clara Li&s;arda</HI> you are &s;ufficiently ac|quainted with; how earne&s;tly I lov'd, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible in my Opinion to Comprehend; this hath been the Cau&s;e of all my Misfortunes which happen'd, as follows:</P>
<P>After my mi&s;take was di&s;cover'd when I met you on the Road, &s;uch a Raging Madne&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;t my Soul, that had it not been Envy and a de|&s;ire of Revenge, I had certainly en|ded my Life by laying violent hands on my &s;elf, where there lay no fault; for your too great Genero&s;ity as it
<PB REF="42">made me appear a Villain, &s;o my Villainy made it appear the more re|&s;plendent amid&s;t all my ra&s;h Acti|ons, by which any other man, le&s;s good than your &s;elf, &s;o often as For|tune favour'd you with the Oppor|tunity, would have made u&s;e of your Victory; (&s;o far was you from de&s;er|ving any blame) that you never &s;o much as offer'd to &s;atisfie a Revenge that might have grown in any o|ther Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>After I found that in&s;tead of <HI>Li&s;arda</HI> I had married <HI>Clara,</HI> finding by what you &s;aid, and <HI>Clara,</HI> that you went in &s;earch of <HI>Li&s;arda,</HI> I pre&s;ently drove to a Village of mine, where with the Offers of a Reward I got eight of my Servants to wait your Return, giving <HI>Clara</HI> a thou&s;and &s;weet words le&s;t &s;he might ob&s;truct my De&s;ign. I left her in the Village while we, well Mounted and Arm'd, waited your Return on the Road, where you know how we rid away with the Coach: I hoping by this to confirm her in the
<PB REF="42">Belief of your Infidelity; and if not to get my own Ends at lea&s;t, to di&s;|po&s;e her never to make you happy While we were on the way I u&s;ed my Rhetorick, with all the Vows and Prote&s;tations imaginable, after my endeavours of di&s;&s;wading her from you; then I told her that now 'twas in my power whither I'd car|ry her, and how I'd di&s;po&s;e of her; and therefore &s;he had better comply than venture the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a cho|lerick Man: But all this produc'd nothing but Scorn and Slights from her, telling me no Man &s;hould ever have her, except <HI>Ricardo,</HI> who, how|ever the Misfortune happen'd that Night, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible he lov'd her, and was one de&s;erving her love.

Snatching my Dagger from my &s;ide, gave me a Wound in my Brea&s;t, that had certainly kill'd me had her Arm had but a little more &s;trength: At la&s;t, when I &s;aw no|thing could prevail, and that in her Company I endanger'd my Life, I be|thought my &s;elf of carrying her to a Country-Hou&s;e I had, where I would keep her &s;ome time, to &s;ee if I po&s;&s;i|bly could gain her by all the Endea|vours that Love and Kindne&s;s could invent; which I did, and re&s;olving not to &s;tay with her, but to ab&s;ent my &s;elf awhile, giving &s;trict Orders to my Servants not to let her e&s;cape, but withal, to let her have all &s;he could demand. I returned to <HI>Clara,</HI> who daily &s;o endeavoured to make me love her; and con&s;idering I was married, and that I had be&s;t to make my Life as ea&s;ie as I could: In two Months time &s;eeing no hope of pre|vailing
<PB N="73" REF="43">on <HI>La&s;arda, Clara</HI> had &s;o far gain'd me, that I really felt Motions of the greate&s;t Tenderne&s;s for her; and as they &s;ay, <HI>Love begets Love,</HI> &s;o was it with me; I left plying <HI>Li&s;ar|da</HI> with Letters, and began to forget her, and to have my Thoughts wholly taken up by <HI>Clara:</HI> So that at la&s;t I took Coach and went to vi|&s;it <HI>Li&s;arda;</HI> and having heard that after you was heal'd, you went to Travel, told her what I knew, which &s;o Rejoyc'd her, that &s;he ea&s;ily par|don'd me for all things pa&s;t, and &s;o ordering a Coach, I had her convey'd to Town, where &s;he remains in her Fathers Hou&s;e. With what Plea&s;ure <HI>Ricardo</HI> heard all this, is not to be expre&s;s'd, but it was plainly &s;een by his change of Countenance, for now he had recover'd a certain Gaiety and Briskne&s;s common to him before his Misfortune: But Dinner coming up &s;top'd the Procedure of <HI>Fulgentio</HI>'s re|lation. <HI>Don Enrique</HI> all the while at Dinner perceiv'd &s;uch Alacrity in

<PB N="85" REF="49">them no great Entertainment, yet they &s;hould be heartily Welcome, and he thought the Company of that loving Pair would extreamly Grace his Marriage, which he hoped would be &s;hortly Celebrated: Then <HI>Donna Angela</HI> de&s;ired to know if &s;he might be acquainted with his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Name, which he told her was <HI>Li&s;ar|da;</HI> O then, Sir, &s;aith &s;he, you may &s;afe|ly depend on your Marriage, for by her Name I gue&s;s yours to be <HI>Don Ricardo Antonio,</HI> the only Per&s;on &s;he hath told me &s;hould be her Husband; for about three Months ago I came acquainted with her here, &s;he ha|ving vowed the Romery for your Pro&s;perity; we became &s;o intimate|ly acquainted lodging in the &s;ame Inne together, that &s;he told me the whole Story of your Loves. After this <HI>Ricardo</HI> made a Complement to <HI>Federico</HI> of his Bed for him&s;elf and his Lady, and <HI>Enrique</HI> with his La|dy betook them&s;elves to his own; and <HI>Ricardo</HI> getting not quite &s;o fit|ting
<PB REF="50">a Lodging for a Lady, retired contentedly to it, and in the Morn|ing early getting up, got his Hor&s;e in a readine&s;s; when his Friends were ju&s;t beginning to &s;tir, he took leave of them, with their Promi&s;e to fol|low him, and &s;ets forward for <HI>An|daluzia.</HI></P>
<P>Love hath Wings, and never did he accompli&s;h a Journey in &s;o &s;hort a time. It was about 11 at Night when he entred the Town, and perceiving &s;ome Gentlemen at the Door of <HI>Don|na Clara Li&s;arda</HI>'s Hou&s;e, tuning their In&s;truments, by which he knew they had a mind to Divert &s;ome Lady; he at a di&s;tance alighted off his Hor&s;e, de&s;irous, if it was po&s;&s;ible, to know who the&s;e were, &s;erenading, as he thought, his Mi&s;tre&s;s: Therefore by chance finding the next Door open, he entred as if it were his own hou&s;e, and &s;o putting him&s;elf behind the Door, unperceived by them, he heard their Song and Mu&s;ick, which was no &s;ooner ended, but he heard the
<PB N="87" REF="50">Lady &s;hut her Window; the Com|pany took leave of one another, and one who &s;eemed to be the Ma&s;ter of this Treat, mounted a Hor&s;eback: <HI>Don Ricardo,</HI> though tired with a long Journey, and very de&s;irous to &s;ee <HI>Don Pedro de Vargas</HI> the Corregidor, yet more de&s;irous to &s;ee his &s;uppo&s;ed Rival, he mounted his Hor&s;e with intention to follow him; but of a &s;udden he &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded with &s;ix men, who asked him, Whe|ther he would part with his Money or his Life; <HI>Ricardo</HI> more anger'd at their hindring his De&s;ign, than their Audacity, gave no other Reply, but &s;hot and killed one of them, the re&s;t &s;et upon him, but he defended him|&s;elf &s;o well, till his &s;uppo&s;ed Rival, not yet got &s;o far off, but that he heard the Noi&s;e they made, was re|turn'd, by which the Rogues forgot the thoughts of Booty, and endea|voured to &s;ave their Lives by run|ning: And <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> thus freed, turning to thank the Gentleman,
<PB REF="51">knew him for his Cou&s;in <HI>Don Pedro</HI> the Corregidor. Great were their Joy, for &s;eeing each other, throwing them&s;elves about one anothers Neck, and embracing. They were no &s;ooner got home, but they went to Bed, for at <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s de&s;ire, he &s;tay'd there, it being late; but <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> had his Thoughts &s;o bu&s;ily employ'd on <HI>Li&s;arda,</HI> that gave him leave but ju&s;t to &s;atisfie Nature with Sleep; awa|king early in the Morning, he pre|&s;ently was for going to vi&s;it, or at lea&s;t write to <HI>Li&s;arda;</HI> &s;till enter|taining him&s;elf with the Hopes of her Con&s;tancy; although now and then the Serenade he had heard, and at her Hou&s;e, would interrupt him in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Thoughts; and his hearing the Window &s;hut, made him conceive that the Serenaded Per|&s;on was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the Com|plement; but then again, other Rea|&s;ons and other Thoughts di&s;&s;waded him from his Jealou&s;ie. <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s de&s;ire to enjoy his Cou&s;ins Compa|ny

<HEAD><HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Loves of</HI> Don Roderigo <HI>and</HI> Don Pedro, <HI>to</HI> Donna Ma|ria.</HEAD>
<P>AFter your Departure, dear Cou|&s;in, which being &s;o privately, we were extreamly troubled, le&s;t your melancholy Thoughts might have made you Injure your &s;elf, and not knowing what was become of you, the whole Town was &s;o Con|cern'd, they cry'd out for Revenge on the Villains who we &s;uppo&s;ed had mi&s;us'd you, and killed tho&s;e that were brought home with you; but finding no Evidence again&s;t them, but their own Confe&s;&s;ions, was, That they at the Noi&s;e coming
<PB N="91" REF="52">out of their Hou&s;es found the Mur|derers gone, and you all on the Ground, who they &s;uppos'd Dead; that they would have taken your Cloaths and Money, and to that end carried you to their Hou&s;e; be|&s;ides receiving a Letter from <HI>Don Fulgentio,</HI> brought by the fair <HI>Li&s;ar|da,</HI> that di&s;charged them of the Mur|der. I was going to pa&s;s Sentence on them for a years Impri&s;onment, when <HI>Donna Maria,</HI> who&s;e Va&s;&s;als they were, begged, or rather com|manded their Freedom. 'Twas fir&s;t here I began to Admire; but after|wards, as I have told you, Vi&s;iting <HI>Donna Li&s;arda,</HI> and &s;eeing her there, I began to Adore tho&s;e extraordinary Perfections and Accompli&s;hments I found in her: Here began I to know the Happine&s;s of Loving, and being Belov'd; for both her Parents and &s;he liked me, my Quality and E&s;tate being both very great: But, Sir, Cro&s;&s;es are things in&s;eparable from Love, and I mu&s;t al&s;o have my
<PB N="92" REF="53">&s;hare; I had <HI>Don Roderigo Va&s;ques</HI> for my Rival, a Man who&s;e Tongue &s;tands him in much &s;tead, &s;ince without ever drawing his Sword, no Duel, no gallant Actions are per|formed, but he makes him&s;elf the Owner, and draws all the Reputa|tion of them to him&s;elf, and that with &s;uch Cunning and Subtilty, that long time he had unde&s;ervingly the Name of a Heroe. My Courage &s;ufficiently known in many famous Exploits for the Service of the King,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All Governours of Towns in</HI> Spain <HI>carry a Wand in token of their Office.</HI></NOTE> and that hath gained me this Honoura|ble Verge, was Eclips'd by this fal&s;e Light; and <HI>Donna Maria,</HI> a Woman of an He|roick Spirit, &s;eemed at the &s;ame time the Match was making between us, to lend him her Ear readier than to any other; &s;uch was his Cun|ning and his Art in deceiving and in|venting new Deceits, that I was al|mo&s;t afraid he would Cheat me of my Mi&s;tre&s;s: But one Day, it hap|pen'd
<PB N="93" REF="53">well for me, (&s;ince no further harm was done.) We were &s;tanding and di&s;cour&s;ing &s;ome other Gentle|man, when news was brought us <HI>Don|na Maria</HI>'s hou&s;e was in a Flame; we all ran to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Fa|mily: But Gods! What Terrour was it for me to &s;ee <HI>Donna Maria</HI> in the Balcony, (the Hou&s;e being &s;urround|ed by the Fire,) begging Aid to help her from peri&s;hing; eagerly I ran through the Flame, and getting up Stairs, luckily found a Bar of Iron, with which I broke a Hole through the Wall; then &s;natching her up in my Arms, I carried her through that Hole, which the Fire had not yet reach'd, and gave her into her Fa|ther's Arms. The Fright, the Noi&s;e, and Fear they were in, would not permit them to take notice of me; and I remembring her Woman was left behind, went to venture a &s;e|cond time, but met <HI>Roderigo</HI> bring|ing her through the &s;ame Hole, who fearful of the Flames, had got a Lad|der,
<PB N="94" REF="54">by which he got into the Balco|ny to help off <HI>Donna Maria</HI>'s Wo|man; and &s;eeing that my help was no further needed, went away about my Occa&s;ions, not to be trouble&s;ome at &s;uch a bu&s;ie time. But <HI>Don Roderi|go</HI> carried the Woman where her La|dy was, and ju&s;t come to her &s;elf, for the Smoak and Fright put her into a Swoon, in which Condition I took her, carried her to her Father, and left her: She &s;eeing him doing that good Office to her Woman, &s;uppo|&s;ed it was him that had done the &s;ame for her; and truly with the Noi&s;e and Fright, her Friends took not &s;o much Notice as to be able to do me Ju&s;tice; &s;o that in Recom|pence of his &s;aving her Life, (as &s;he &s;uppos'd) She with her Friends Vow'd to be his; He with a feigned Mode&s;ty, &s;aid, That he truly had done nothing for their Service, at lea&s;t, it was &s;o little, as did not de|&s;erve Thanks from her Mouth, much le&s;s &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing as Her &s;elf;
<PB N="95" REF="54">but it was too great a Good to be refu&s;ed, and that he now tru&s;ted to her Word.</P>
<P>The next Day it was all about the Town that <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> had ventur'd through the Fire, and re&s;cued <HI>Donna Maria:</HI> This was every bodies &s;tory which did not a little vex me. I af|firm'd the Action to be mine, and that he ly'd who &s;aid the contrary. <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> &s;aid, Yes it was I did it; but that with &s;uch a fal&s;e Smile, &s;uch a feigned Di&s;&s;imulation, and with &s;uch Equivocating words, that he own'd the Action more in his Denial than I in all my Affirmatives; but what did comfort me, was, I had a Witne&s;s in my Pocket, that though it was Inanimate, with <HI>Donna Maria</HI> I was &s;ure would confute my Rival. Sir, it was a Ring I took off her Fin|ger as I carried her out of the Fire; and therefore to do my &s;elf Ju&s;tice, I went to give her Father a Vi&s;it, who now were all in <HI>Donna Li&s;ar|da</HI>'s Hou&s;e; and de&s;iring to &s;ee
<PB N="96" REF="55"><HI>Donna Maria,</HI> and telling her the Truth, the Ring gave it Credit, with the Promi&s;e to me &s;he had gi|ven to <HI>Roderigo;</HI> the &s;tory now was turn'd, and it was made known throughout the Town, how fal&s;ly <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> claimed the Honour of that Action; &s;o that through &s;hame he was fain to leave the Town, and retire to a Seat he has in the Coun|try where he &s;till continues.</P>
<P>Having thus ended his Story, <HI>Don Ricardo</HI> being de&s;irous to &s;ee his <HI>Li&s;arda,</HI> they went together, but the Joy <HI>Li&s;arda</HI> had at the &s;ight of <HI>Ri|cardo,</HI> cannot be expre&s;t, no more than his at the &s;ight of her. But to be &s;hort with you, and to make an end; both his Marriage with <HI>Li&s;ar|da,</HI> and his Cou&s;ins with <HI>Donna Ma|ria</HI> were concluded, and to be Cele|brated both the Sunday following; On the Day before the Marriage, <HI>Don Enrique</HI> and <HI>Don Federico,</HI> with their Ladies Arrived, &s;o that they
<PB N="97" REF="55">had a full Hou&s;e, great Entertain|ment, and a long continued Fea&s;t for Joy, and living very lovingly and happily all the Days of their Lives.</P>
