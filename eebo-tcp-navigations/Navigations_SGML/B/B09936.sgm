<HEAD>A Sad, and True RELATION Of &s;ix Seamen, who &s;old them&s;elves to the <HI>DEVIL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THough this following Relation, contains matter of very great Wonder and Amazement; Neverthele&s;s it comes to our hands, confirm'd by that &s;ufficient Te&s;timony, that we offer it to the Reader, as a Narrative of unque&s;tioned Truth and Reputation.</P>
<P>By a Letter from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> dated the 23 of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, written by a Per&s;on of Worth and Credit in that I&s;land, we have this &s;trange and amazing Relation: That the <HI>Margaret</HI> from <HI>Bo&s;ten</HI> the 21 of <HI>December</HI> 1696. Bound to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> In their Pa&s;&s;age, one of the Sailors at the Helm, did call unto the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, and told him, that he could not &s;teer no longer; Then the Ma&s;ter ask|ing the Rea&s;on, he replyed, that he was not well, and for that Cau&s;e quitted his Po&s;t. Upon this the Ma&s;ter went immediatly and took the Helm; The &s;aid Sailor did likewi&s;e further declare, that there &s;tood a Spirit by the Bin|nacle, that accu&s;ed him of killing a Woman, a fault which the &s;aid Spirit had fal&s;ly accu&s;ed him withal, for he never committed any &s;uch unmanly Crime in his Life; The Spirit he &s;aid, likewi&s;e further told him, that all the Ships Company had contracted and &s;igned an Agreement with the Devil, which was u&s;ed as an Argument, for to entice him to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The next day after, the Fellow fell into mo&s;t &s;trange <HI>Deliriams,</HI> and talked of wonderfull Accidents that would certainly befall the Ship, the which were looked upon as nothing, thinking this proceeded from the wild Notions of his crazed Sen&s;es, the <HI>Chimera</HI>'s of Frenzy. Particularly he &s;aid, That the Spirit had brought a Boat to fetch him away, with other rediculous idle Di&s;cour&s;e of that Nature.</P>
<P>Upon the 17 of <HI>January,</HI> in the Latitude of 19, about 9 at night, a &s;mall and white Cloud aro&s;e, without any Rain or extraordinary Wind, which pre&s;ently falling upon the Ship, pre&s;&s;ed her down with &s;trange, and indeed &s;upernatural weight and force, that the Hatches flew out, and the whole Ship was under Water, by which unhappy Accident, the Boy was wa&s;ht off and drowned.</P>
<P>But here to begin the more miraculous part of my Narrative, the Ship con|tinued 11 weeks under water, a thing that &s;truck (as may well be imagined) an extraordinary amazing Con&s;ternation &amp; Confu&s;ion through all the Mariners, from &s;everal &s;trange &s;orts of Arguments of their A&s;toni&s;hment. Fir&s;t, That the Ship it &s;hould be &s;o wholly immerged under the Water, &amp; yet not to &s;ink down
<PB REF="2">right to the bottom. Secondly, That though they were apparently thus un|der Water, and yet the Ship was not wholly filled with Water, but that they had Air enough for to breath in, by which great Means they continued alive, and feeding all that while upon Raw Meat, and fre&s;h fi&s;h, which came &s;wim|ing over the Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;everal of which they eagerly caught and eat: Their Lodging was on Boards and Planks, the which were placed athwart the Rail, near the Taffrel, covered with a Sail. The Men were alwi&s;e wet, which in &s;o long a time, made that impre&s;&s;ion upon them, that their Fle&s;h on their Bo|dies was galled and raw.</P>
<P>But what was the mo&s;t amazing and di&s;malle&s;t part of all, was, Six of the Ships Crew, upon the &s;inking of the Ve&s;&s;el under Water, were frighted with Infernal Spirits, and about twelve the very fir&s;t Night, were carried away invi|&s;ibly, leaving no more than four Per&s;ons alive behind them; Which indeed gave &s;ome little and &s;mall Credit, to what the forementioned Sailor at the Helm, had declared in his <HI>Deliriums.</HI></P>
<P>After this Eleven Weeks immurement in the&s;e wondrous watery Walls, for &s;o I may ju&s;ty call it. the Ship recovered her &s;elf again, and the fir&s;t Land they could di&s;cover was the I&s;land of <HI>Diffiado,</HI> which, with &s;o few hands left, they could not fetch up, by rea&s;on of a &s;trong Northern Current that bore again&s;t them, the next was <HI>Grand Terra,</HI> where they met with the &s;ame di&s;appointment; But on the fifth of <HI>April,</HI> they run them&s;elves upon the &s;hore upon <HI>Gaurdelopo,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> treated them very kindly, not as Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Names of the three Seamen left alive, are, <HI>William Davis</HI> Ma&s;ter (a Man very well known in <HI>London</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Barbadoe</HI>'s Merchants) <HI>William Cadner,</HI> and <HI>William Bywater.</HI></P>
<P>Note only the Original Letter, and the whole Relation at large, is for to be &s;een at Mr. <HI>Loyds</HI> Coffee-hou&s;e in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> where likewi&s;e &s;everal Per&s;ons are to be heard of, and &s;poken withall u|pon the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> in Atte&s;tation of the whole Truth herein declared.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> in his Treati&s;e of Spirits, &s;ayes, That tho Hurri|canes and Tempe&s;ts have natural Cau&s;es, yet there is great Rea&s;on to think they are managed by Spirits. In Confirmation whereof, he hath related ma|ny Notable In&s;tances of his own particular Deliverances, from the fury of mo&s;t Boy&s;terous Whirl-winds. Namely, when the Reapers in <HI>Eve&s;ham</HI> Vale were hurt, writhen, and one killed, Some Friendly Power (for &s;o he expre&s;&s;es it) re&s;trained the Cour&s;e of Gravally Sand, rai&s;'d by a Whirl-wind, as it met him in a Narrow Lane.</P>
