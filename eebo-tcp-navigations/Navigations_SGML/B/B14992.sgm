<P>They write from <HI>Genua,</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> is arrived neare their Territorie with great Forces: which cau&s;ed them to haue an eye vpon him, and to looke to them&s;elues.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bredaw</HI> are expected divers hor&s;e, and to the &s;ame purpo&s;e are their Stables prepared and made readie: And in <HI>Berghen op Zoom,</HI> and other places thereabout, are likewi&s;e great &s;tore of Forces to be &s;ent, to what effect God knowes.</P>

The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> could make but 8000. to re&s;i&s;t him, &s;o he was forced to compound with him, to giue him Corne and money, neuerthele&s;&s;e, he burned and &s;poyled a great many of his Me&s;&s;ages, &s;o the Duke <HI>de Bulloynes</HI> plot was di&s;covered, for he had promi|&s;ed to deliver into <HI>Mansfeilds</HI> hands three Townes
<PB N="12" REF="8">in <HI>France,</HI> whereof <HI>Saus</HI> in <HI>Burgon</HI> was one of the three, &s;o he marched downe towards <HI>Sedan,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Bulloyne.</HI> The King hearing of this, &s;ent a|way from his Armie Duke <HI>Denawers,</HI> Duke <HI>de Angu|lame,</HI> Duke <HI>de Lonigewen,</HI> to levell Forces for to re|&s;pite him with all &s;peed; and as he marched he came to a Cittie which is called <HI>Mun&s;on,</HI> which is vpon the border of <HI>France,</HI> but not in <HI>France.</HI> And then the the Duke <HI>de Naweres</HI> and <HI>Mansfield</HI> came to a parley, &s;o that the Duke brought him to the Cittie with him, and placed his Armie clo&s;e vnder the Walles, and was faine to furni&s;h his Armie with bread and victualles, &s;o he told the Duke that both he and his Armie were at the Kings &s;ervice, in giuing him foure hundred thou&s;and Crownes, and a yearely pen&s;ion, and &s;hewed him &s;even Letters which the Duke <HI>de Bulloyne</HI> had written to him. This the Duke writ to the King: in the meane time, the French levelled great Armies, both of foote and hor&s;e. And the Duke entertained him, vntill the Kings an&s;were came, which was done with great di&s;cretion, for the Kings Armies are now with the three Dukes in bringing to a head; in two dayes they are in &s;everall places thirtie fiue thou&s;and, and <HI>Mansfeild</HI> is twelue thou&s;and Foote, and eyght thou&s;and Hor&s;e: he told the Duke, that there is fiue thou&s;and of the eyght thou&s;and Hor&s;emen, the be&s;t in Chri&s;ten|dome.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hoppe perceiuing that <HI>Mansfeild</HI> would make his owne peace, and leaue him, there grew a Mutinie in the Armie: and the Bi&s;hoppe would haue left <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and haue gone to the Duke
<PB N="13" REF="8">of <HI>Bulloyne,</HI> but the Duke <HI>Denaweres,</HI> pacified them both.</P>
<P>This I thinke was to colour their intent, &s;o in the end the Kings an&s;were came, which was this; He would neyther of his &s;ervice, nor his Armie, nor giue him any money, &s;o the Duke <HI>Denaweres</HI> and he parted, and he went away without doing any harme, &s;o <HI>Mansfeild</HI> went and conferred with the Duke of <HI>Bulloyne,</HI> in the fields in their Coa|ches, and each of them had three hundred men; what the Conference was we know not, neyther can we tell what <HI>Mansfeild</HI> will doe yet. But he hath burned and &s;poyled in <HI>Loraine,</HI> and vpon the borders of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ixtie Villages and Ca&s;tles, and he is very rich in robbing the Churches of their Chali&s;es and Cro&s;&s;es, and Images, and he hath fiue thou&s;and Women or Whores in his Campe. The Duke <HI>de Bulloine</HI> &s;o &s;oone as he heard that <HI>Mansfeild</HI> was come into <HI>Loraine,</HI> levelled all the moneyes that was due to the King for this yeare, and fiue yeares to come, in all parts round about him, and forced them to make &s;hift to pay him, and tho&s;e that would not, nor could not pay &s;o &s;uddenly, he hanged them, and killed and hanged fiue of the Kings owne &s;ervants, that were there to receiue the Kings Rents. And now of late he hath furni&s;hed <HI>Mansfield</HI> with Powder and other things, and hath bought all the Corne he can, and brought it into <HI>Sedan;</HI> We &s;hall know within the&s;e &s;ixe dayes, what they will doe, <HI>Mans|feild</HI> cannot goe backe againe, for the Emperours Armie lyeth in waite for him, and if he come in|to

<P>AFter <HI>Mansfield</HI> was arriued at <HI>Iambloies, Don Cordua</HI> with mo&s;t of the Countrey Bores, got to a Towne called <HI>Leymon,</HI> by which <HI>Mansfield</HI> mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;itie pa&s;&s;e, and &s;o was con&s;trained to encounter him: The oppo&s;ition that came again&s;t <HI>Mansfield</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> was for certaine betweene 30. or 40000. Bores and Souldiers together, who had &s;o &s;trongly intrenched them&s;elues, and placed their Ordenance, before <HI>Mansfields</HI> comming, that to pa&s;&s;e through them, was very dange|rous; which of nece&s;&s;itie they mu&s;t doe, before they could get any pa&s;&s;age towards <HI>Breda.</HI> It is mo&s;t credible, that <HI>Mansfields</HI> hor&s;emen, after they had encompa&s;&s;ed <HI>Gonzales de Cordua's</HI> Forces, did &s;o valiantly behaue them&s;elues, that
<PB N="14" REF="10">on a &s;udden they were put to a great rout: &s;o that Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> by meanes of certaine companies of his hor&s;e|men, &s;urprized their Ordenance from the Bores, the which they kept couragiou&s;ly for the &s;pace of two houres, in this time they were imployed vpon the enemies, they ha|uing not wherewith to defend them&s;elues: &s;o that by the meanes of lo&s;ing their Ordenance, they were &s;laine in great multitudes. Yet notwith&s;tanding, the multitudes of Bores were &s;o great, being thru&s;t forward by <HI>Don Cor|dua's</HI> old &s;ouldiers, that they gathered a head, and obtay|ned their Ordenance once againe. But before they were wholly recouered, the enemie lo&s;t aboue 1000. men. Be|ing animated on both &s;ides, the Battell at this time conti|nued very fierce, wherein the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> behaued him&s;elfe mo&s;t valiantly, in&s;omuch that hee receiued a &s;hot in the left Arme, neere vnto the Wre&s;t; and notwith&s;tan|ding this misfortune, hee would not leaue the Field, but fought &s;till couragiou&s;ly at lea&s;t the &s;pace of foure houres; in which time he met with <HI>Gonzales de Cordua</HI> in per&s;on: whereupon the Duke (it &s;eemes) not re&s;pecting his woun|ded Arme, couragiou&s;ly made two &s;hots at him with his Pi&s;toll, and it is thought one of them tooke effect, for here is newes come, that he is &s;laine. This is certaine, hee is at this time mi&s;&s;ing, and not to be found; but the truth of this you &s;hall &s;hortly heare. The Duke of <HI>Brun&s;|wicke</HI> &s;till pre&s;t further among his enemies, pro&s;ecuting the Bores, who &s;warmed about him in great multitudes, that in the end the Duke lo&s;t his Standard, and receiued another &s;hot in the middle of his Arme, and yet would not leaue the Field for a good while after, as it &s;eemes not regarding the two Wounds hee had receiued on his left Arme; which the whole Field, as well enemies as friends, admired to &s;ee his worthie to bee pray&s;ed valour.
<PB N="15" REF="10">A little before the Battell was ended, hee was con&s;trayned to leaue the Field, in regard of the Wounds hee receiued on his Arme, the lo&s;&s;e of which is and ought to bee la|mented for by all true Prote&s;tants. After this, hee was conueyed out of the Armie, in a Hor&s;e-Litter made of Reedes, to &s;ome &s;ecure place for his &s;afetie; but going with great ha&s;t, hee vnfortunately fell downe vpon the fore&s;aid Arme, part whereof being cut off; which did &s;o inflame the Wound, that he was enforced once againe to haue it cut off a little below the elbow. As for Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> he &s;till continued the maine Battell, vntill three a clocke in the afternoone; about which time, <HI>Mansfields</HI> hor&s;emen played the Deuill among&s;t the Bores, as them&s;elues repor|ted after the Battell. The&s;e afore&s;aid hor&s;emen put the Bores to rout, and beat them backe amaine, and recouered the Ordenance from them; and indeed, was the chiefe&s;t cau&s;e that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> remained Ma&s;ter of the Field, as you &s;hall pre&s;ently vnder&s;tand. The&s;e hor&s;emen hauing obtained the Ordenance from the Bores, put them into &s;uch a feare, that they became wholly di&s;ordered: which aduantage the <HI>Mansfeldaans</HI> e&s;pying, fell vpon them, and flew a great number of them, mo&s;t of them being Bores, and continually put forwards by the old Souldiers. By which meanes, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> obtaining the be&s;t, con|&s;trained <HI>Don Cordua</HI> to &s;ound a retreat. Nay further, it is certified, that if &s;ome of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> hor&s;emen had taken an opportunitie, which fortunately was proffered them, they had vtterly ouerthrowne and di&s;comfited <HI>Don Cordua's</HI> Forces; which, when he mu&s;tered about <HI>Lier,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of two thou&s;and hor&s;e and eight thou&s;and foot, the mo&s;t whereof, were old and well experienced Souldi|ers. In this fight it is mo&s;t credibly reported, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath &s;lain very neere a thou&s;and of the enemies,
<PB N="16" REF="11">among&s;t whom, was &s;laine a great Commander, <HI>Don Fran|ci&s;co Geuana.</HI> He hath likewi&s;e taken mo&s;t of his Ordnance, all his Munition and Trea&s;ure, be&s;ides two Waggons of Plate, all which are &s;afely arriued in <HI>Breda.</HI> Here all the Trea&s;ure was diuided among&s;t <HI>Mansfields</HI> and <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> &s;ouldiers. Likewi&s;e Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath burned &amp; &s;poy|led mo&s;t part of the Countrey in his pa&s;&s;age through it, as al&s;o the corne on the field. Here it is certified, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> lo&s;t not in this Battell aboue 1000. men, but hee lo&s;t aboue 2000. but not all cut off by the Sword, as you &s;hall heare. The Battell being ended, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> with his Forces departed towards <HI>Breda:</HI> but before his ar|riuall there, hee lo&s;t 1200. the occa&s;ion of who&s;e deaths, were the inhabitants dwelling in tho&s;e parts; who vnder|&s;tanding that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> was ma&s;ter of the field, and that he afterwards intended to march with his Forces to|wards the Magi&s;trats or Gouernor of euery Towne there|abouts; gaue priuat command, that Springs or Ditches of Water which lay in their pa&s;&s;age towards <HI>Breda,</HI> &s;hould be infected with &s;trong poy&s;on, and by this denilli&s;h inuenti|on they lo&s;t within the compa&s;&s;e of twelue dayes aboue 1200, men, onely with drinking their poy&s;oned waters, &s;o that euery day they lo&s;t 100.: it &s;eems by this that <HI>Man&s;|field</HI> lo&s;t more me~ by 200, that were poy&s;on'd, then he had cut off by the &s;word in the battel. Before they were at <HI>Bre|da,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;ent to refre&s;h his army 30000. loaues, be&s;ides other proui&s;ion, which was welcome to the &s;ouldiers: after they were arriued, the towne welcomed them royally, &s;hooting off all their Ordnance, making Bonefires, ringing of Bels, warlicke In&s;truments, &amp; good proui&s;ion for the common &s;ouldiers, withal the entertain|ment they were able to make them. After they were well refre&s;hed, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> trained them in good di&s;ci|pline
<PB N="17" REF="11">of war almo&s;t euery day: he hath brought with him 6000. of the be&s;t hor&s;e in Chri&s;tendome, and 4000. foote|men; be&s;ides a great number wearied and &s;icke men, which come dayly to him in great numbers. I beleeue you had a fal&s;e report was &s;pred all ouer the&s;e countries, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had &s;ent 3000. men to meete with <HI>Don Cordua,</HI> which lo&s;ing their way, were cut off by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Luckes</HI> forces; but for certaine, there is no &s;uch matter, for Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> neuer &s;ent out a man to meete with <HI>Don Cordua,</HI> before <HI>Don Cordua</HI> him&s;elfe met with him. It is certainly reported that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had a skirmi&s;h with <HI>Don Cordua</HI> before his entrance into <HI>Henego,</HI> in which <HI>Don Cerdua</HI> had the wor&s;t; but afterwards hauing that great &s;upply of the Bores of that countrey, did make a ve|ry great oppo&s;ition again&s;t Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> in which was &s;laine aboue 1000. men on both &s;ides. At <HI>Mansfields</HI> fir&s;t comming into the Prouince of <HI>Henego,</HI> the Bores of the countrey vnder&s;tanding of his comming, had carryed away all their proui&s;ion, that for the &s;pace of foure or &s;iue dayes Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> forces found no more to feede vpon then what the trees did affoord them, which bred a great weakne&s;&s;e in his whole army: but &s;hortly after they found very good pa&s;ture in that fruitfull Dukedome of <HI>Brabant;</HI> nay I do ab&s;olutely thinke it to be the fruitfulle&s;t and riche&s;t in all the &s;euenteene. It is further certified, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hath gathered in a readine&s;&s;e 4000. the braue&s;t hor&s;e tho&s;e Prouinces can yeeld, to ioyne with <HI>Mansfields</HI> hor&s;e. Moreouer there are to be brought to the Graue of <HI>Lip&s;tat</HI> 2000. more, al which makes 12000. hor&s;e, which hath &s;eldome been &s;eene in the States iuri&s;dictions. Further it is thought his Excellency hath ready in &s;euerall places, betwixt 30. &amp; 40000. foote: here is now great like|lihood of bloody wars in this country, for that <HI>Don Cordus</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="12">likewi&s;e receiueth greater helpes from the Palatinate, and that the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> is comming downe to ayde <HI>Don Cordua</HI> with great forces. Here it is at this pre&s;ent repor|ted, that <HI>Gonzales de Corduas</HI> forces are arriued at <HI>Antwerp</HI> and there remaineth, for that it is greatly feared among&s;t them, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will be&s;iege the &s;ame, ha|uing &s;o many forces in a readine&s;&s;e. Here it is thought the chiefe rendez-vous of the States warre will bee in and about <HI>Breda,</HI> both to draw the enemies forces from great|ly offending others, and defence of their owne, knowing that a warre maintained in the enemies countrey, is very preualent to weary, or ouercome. And it is thought, though that <HI>Mansfield</HI> wil plant his army betwixt <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Bergen vp Zome,</HI> to imbarre all proui&s;ions from <HI>Spino|las</HI> army, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath left the one halfe of his foote with the Duke <HI>de Boulloign,</HI> as al&s;o his munition: the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> is certainly more grieued for the lo&s;&s;e of his Standerd, then for the lo&s;&s;e of his arme. Some &s;oul|diers comming hither, bring newes that certain letters are written by the Dutche&s;&s;e of <HI>Brabant</HI> to <HI>Spinola,</HI> wherein are di&s;clo&s;ed diuers &s;ecrets of &s;trange plots again&s;t the States and other Princes, to the States great aduantage. This day the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> being in the great Hall of the town, the Duke &s;hewed him&s;elfe with a merry countenance, and &s;eemes prettily amended, and pa&s;t danger at the cutting off his arme, be&s;eeching God that he might recouer of his wound, to be reuenged of his enemies.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> forces that remained here, haue three &s;euerall times taken and &s;poyled great &s;tore of waggons with victuals that was carrying to <HI>Spinolas</HI> campe before <HI>Bergen;</HI> and al&s;o hath &s;laine their conuoyes, &s;o that no vi|ctuals can be brought to releeue the &s;ouldiers which are
