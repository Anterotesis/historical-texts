<P>This day the Imperiall Feild-Mar&s;hall hath &s;ent hither to this Citie a warlike Commi&s;&s;ary, with a reque&s;t that wee-would be plea&s;ed to afford the Imperiall Army free pa&s;&s;age, and grant them to be enquartered thereabouts. After this Commi&s;&s;ary had waited with his Convoy before the Gates of the City for an an&s;wer, from twelue of the Clocke till two in the afternoone, was at la&s;t &s;uffered to enter, and cau&s;ed to propound his errand vpon the Towne-hou&s;e, after he had made his &s;peech and ended his propo&s;ition, he was wi&s;hed to returne backe to his lodging, vntill they had fully delibe|rated concerning his demand of &s;o high a nature. This Com|mi&s;&s;ary Generall finding the time of his expectation for an an&s;wer &s;omewhat too long and tedious, returned backe to the Citie gate againe, before he was &s;ent for, but was not &s;uffered to enter before fiue of the Clocke. And when he had confer|red with the Peeres and Coun&s;ell, they could in no wi&s;e agree together, whereupon he departed peaceably for that time. Afterward his Feild-Mar&s;hall commanded hither certaine Regiments of Souldiers, with &s;ome Ordnance, and deman|ded obedience from the Citie, and willed to yeeld. Which we perceiving to be &s;o earne&s;tly intended, yeelded our &s;elues, after &s;ome Articles of agreement con&s;idered and concluded vpon, and our Garri&s;on departed out of the Citie, and we &s;uf|fered eleven Companies of the Emperours forces to enter. Lately al&s;o the Commander

<HEAD>Extract out of a letter from <HI>Maintz</HI> the <HI>16.</HI> of November.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, If you did now come hither againe, you would mar+vell at the alteration that is here, you know there was but three Moneths agoe &s;uch boa&s;ting among&s;t us and &s;uch writing of pa&s;quils again&s;t our Neighbours e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Vlm,</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>Wirtenburg,</HI> where the Monkes, Prie&s;ts, and Nunns had taken into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion many a goodly and rich Cloy&s;ter! But now we doe heare among&s;t us here, nothing but complaints, deliberations whether to flye and what to doe, &amp; on the other &s;ide we do heare, there they are now taking their turn and pay us in the &s;ame coin they lately received from us. Thus goeth the world: Our Generall <HI>Tilly,</HI> who&s;e name I doe beleeve is rather v&s;ed to encourage us then to affright the Enemies, who (we do well &s;ee) doe neither care whether he be alive or dead, is &s;aid to have a great Army and I beleeve he hath it; But what he doth with it I cannot tell. Hee hath beene long about to take the towne of <HI>Wertheim</HI> (as we have beene often enfor|med by letters) wherein are but 5. or 600. Swedes! And yet he cannot ma&s;ter them, and meanwhile there is &s;till one re|giment and troupe or other of Imperiali&s;ts, and of Loraines beaten, and I can a&s;&s;ure you that the Loraines have no more mind to meete with the Swedes, for they &s;olicite &s;till to be put in gari&s;ons in &s;uch places as are farthe&s;t from their E|nemy, and likely to be not troubled or a&s;&s;aulted at all. Thus we &s;uffer more already by tho&s;e that will make us believe to be our defenders, then we could feare at the Swedes hand, if we do no wor&s;e to them then the Countrey of <HI>Wirtzburg</HI> hath done, who is now in their Kings po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but with|all in peace and quietne&s;&s;e. But of this I dare not &s;ay, what I thinke. The Kings troupes have lately a&s;&s;aulted one of the Imperiall quarters which was betwixt <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hop&s;heim</HI> &amp; <HI>Mer|genthal,</HI> out of which almo&s;t all the Imperiali&s;ts (having gotten notice of the Swedes comming) ran away and &s;o by their light heeles &s;aved their lives; For tho&s;e that were not &s;o quick were &s;oone put to the number of the dead by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who &s;lew about two hundred and tooke three&s;core pri&s;oners, and withall all the Baggage that was left there, <PB N="13" REF="8">which was laden (but could not &s;o &s;peedily be convoyed away) upon above two hundred Waggons, all which be&s;ides many o|ther Hor&s;es, Mules, and other cattell was &s;eized by the &s;ayd <HI>Swedes</HI> without any Notary, and carried away towards their roy|all Campe neare <HI>Wirtsburgh.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;orry I cannot tell you of &s;o great matters and victories as formerly I did oftentimes, when both <HI>Wall&s;tein</HI> (while&s;t hee was upon our &s;tage of Warre, and playd his part) and
<HI>Tilly</HI> did every weeke, nay day, get &s;ome notable Towne, Ca&s;tle, and place, where they found no body that dur&s;t oppo&s;e them, there having never appeared any great Army re&s;olutely again&s;t them, except that of the Bores in <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> How&s;oever, I will give you what I receive, and tell you the truth, though it is not liked a|mong&s;t us here. We had ye&s;terday Letters, and I have heard it confirmed this morning by a Colonell of ours, that 13. Fin|landers (Hor&s;emen) met with 60. Lorraines, and although the Finlanders &s;aw them a farre off, and could have fled and &s;aved them&s;elves (for the Country is thereabouts not open) yet with a boldne&s;&s;e and courage that defies and &s;cornes death it &s;elfe, they &s;et among&s;t them; and without any delay, layd downe to the ground the mo&s;t part of the &s;ayd Lorraines; and made the re&s;t which were yet 16. to yeeld, and &s;o the&s;e 13. Finlanders (which our Country people feares now as if they were Fiend|landers; that is, of the Land of the Divell) brought away to their King
16. Lorraines, without any complement, for I a&s;|&s;ure you, that they could under&s;tand never a word the one of the others.</P>
<P>Our Army of the Imperiall and Catholike and Lorraine troopes, doth onely endeavor (as I doe perceive) to hinder the Circle of
<HI>Swaben,</HI> and other Townes of <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> &amp; the Countries thereabouts to joyne or to yeeld to the <HI>Swedes:</HI> But yet ne|verthele&s;&s;e we doe heare, that the &s;ayd Countries and the chiefe Townes and Imperiall Cities have already or doe yet &s;end and acco~modate them&s;elves with that King, and put them&s;elves un|der his protection.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Norimbergh</HI> is altogether in love with him, and wil be trimmed after his owne de&s;ire, having already Swedi&s;h Engineers, that give order for new fortifications thereof; and there are made leavies for the &s;ayd City, which they will enter|taine in the &s;ayd King of
<HI>Swedens</HI> &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>&V;lm</HI> we heare are doing as much, although I have yet no particular notice of what they are re&s;olved: But this I
<PB N="14" REF="9">know, that they (having &s;ome troopes for their owne defence ready) have hereby beaten backe &s;ome Imperiall forces, that were come out of Italy with much paine and labour, and craving from tho&s;e of
<HI>&V;lm,</HI> (but with &s;ome threatnings) &s;ome reliefe; namely, for every Hor&s;e 10. dollers, and for every Soldier 6. dol|lers (and there were of them
12. Companies) they were for all an&s;wer, contribution and comfort, and without any compa&s;&s;ion of their wearine&s;&s;e and &s;ufferings they indured by pa&s;&s;ing the Alpes, beaten back and driven to lie upon the Archduke <HI>Leopolds</HI> dominions, and &s;o it is thought they will disband.</P>
<P>The K of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath cau&s;ed the Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Wirtzburg</HI> againe to be mended and fortified, that now it may be called what before it was e&s;teemed, an impregnable place in the hands of Swedes. Let this &s;uffice for this time, I hope for better newes &s;hortly.</P>

<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> forces have taken in the mid&s;t of the Catholike army the Old and new Towne of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> making the beginning with the Ca&s;tle which they tooke by Pettarding and E&s;caladoes.

<HI>Palatinate,</HI> for the defence of his own Coun|try, wherat his people (how great &s;oever the feare is among&s;t their Churchmen) is very ill plea&s;ed All the Spani&s;h forces that are come and comming hither towards the
<HI>Rhyne</HI> (which a|mount already to 7000. foot and 32. Cornets of hor&s;e) are to be enquartered (as I doe heare) along the Country called
<HI>Rhinegow</HI> and &s;o lye along the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> to hinder the King of

<HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> whereby he doth call and admoni&s;h all
<HI>We&s;tphalians</HI> that &s;erve either the Emperor or Catholike league, to withdraw them&s;elves out of that &s;ervice, giving them terme of 6. Weekes, which pa&s;t, and they not appearing and obeying, he will proceed again&s;t them (for many Noble and Gent: of that Country &s;erue again&s;t the K. of
<HI>Sweden</HI> and his Allies) and their goods, with all rigour, &amp;c. More you &s;hall have the next Po&s;t.</P>
