<HEAD>REASONS FOR THE <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company's &s;ending out <HI>Twelve</HI> SHIPS to <HI>INDIA</HI> about the 15^t^h of <HI>January</HI> next.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company had Four Ships arriv'd from <HI>India</HI> in <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1691. and in <HI>October</HI> they deliver'd into the Honorable Hou&s;e of Commons a Paper &s;aid to contain a true Account of all their Stock both at home and abroad, wherein they make their E&s;tate then in <HI>England</HI> to amount to about <HI>Thirty Nine Thou&s;and Pounds:</HI> And in that they value their <HI>Dead Stock</HI> at about <HI>Ten Thou&s;and Five Hundred Pounds,</HI> for their Buildings <HI>and Equipage for a Troop of Hor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Now to pa&s;s over all Reflections on the many Notorious Fal&s;ities in that Paper, It may &s;uffice here to ob&s;erve, That were this Article true, 'Tis yet incon&s;iderable, even to a Scandal; For that our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company &s;hould have Four great Ships from <HI>India:</HI> who&s;e Cargoes they valu'd in their afore&s;aid Account at <HI>Three Hundred and Seventy Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and that all that, conjoyn'd with every thing they could po&s;&s;ibly pretend to here before, &s;hould yet altogether, according to their own accompting, make the Total of their <HI>Quick Stock</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> no more than <HI>Twenty Eight Thou&s;and Five Hundred Pounds, <HI>Is too plain a Di&s;covery of their ill Condition.</HI></HI></P>
<P>But tho they were, by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, thus utterly de&s;titute of a &s;ufficient Stock to carry on the Trade, yet they obtain'd leave to &s;end out Five Ships in the Spring, wherein, if they adventur'd any thing for account of the <HI>General Joynt-Stock,</HI> It mu&s;t be borrow d; For the fore&s;aid &s;mall Sum was as little as they cou'd re&s;erve for incident Charges <HI>and Secret Service.</HI> But 'tis well known, that a great part of the Effects laden on tho&s;e Ships, were for the particular Accounts of a few ruling Gentlemen among&s;t them, with &s;uch Friends as they pleas'd to admit into the Concern; together with the <HI>Armenians,</HI> whom, to the great Di&s;honour and Detriment of the Nation, they have of late introduc'd into the Trade. And to cover the&s;e private Concerns from publick Notice, &s;o that they might pa&s;s as the Company's own Goods, the Proprietors were oblig'd to let them go under the Company's Mark, and be enter'd at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> in their Name.</P>
<P>Since this, they have had no more than One Ship from <HI>India,</HI> which is the <HI>Kempthorn,</HI> lately arriv'd, and after &s;he had been detain'd above Two Years in the Country, and the Commander at la&s;t forc'd to prote&s;t for his Di&s;patch, &s;he is now return'd about a Hundred and Fifty Tuns Dead Freighted. Neither were the Goods &s;he brings provided by the Company's own Stock; For, by the Confe&s;&s;ion of a Principal Member of their Committe, their Servants have, for this occa&s;ion, made u&s;e of the Monies of particular Merchants of <HI>London</HI> remaining in their hands, to the amount of <HI>Fifteen Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> for which they have drawn Bills on the Company; And that is at lea&s;t one half of the Co&s;t of her Cargo.</P>
<P>This is the be&s;t Face they them&s;elves can put upon their Affairs here at home: And as to their Condition abroad, if the Evidence in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament were not &s;ufficient, There is now come by the fore&s;aid Ship <HI>Kempthorn</HI> a further Confirmation of the whole Matter, in a Letter from one of their principal Factors, to an Honourable Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, Declaring, <HI>That the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>had lost their E&s;teem in all Places, That the Companies Servants were kept as Pri|&s;oners in the City of</HI> Suratt, <HI>And that the Natives were &s;o Incens'd again&s;t them for their late Ho&s;tilities, That they could &s;carce re|frain from treating them at pre&s;ent after a more &s;evere Manner, tho their own Intere&s;t required it till they had recovered &s;atisfaction for tho&s;e Injuries: Which, if not comply'd with, 'twas fear'd their Rage would drive them to Extremities: And moreover that there was &s;o great a Debt upon the Company at that Place, as would demand a large Stock to be &s;ent out to di&s;charge it.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Tho their Affairs labour under all the&s;e di&s;mal Circum&s;tances, which render them wholly Incapable to act as a Company, according to the true Intent of their Charter; and make it apparent, that this valuable Trade will be intirely lo&s;t to the Nation, if any longer continued in their Hands: Yet tho&s;e Gentlemen who pre&s;ide in the pre&s;ent Management, are Ma&s;ters of &s;o great A&s;&s;urance, To Petition the King in Council, for leave to &s;end no le&s;s than Twelve Ships to <HI>India</HI> this Sea&s;on; And they were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t, to obtain a Grant for half that Number. <HI>But</HI></P>
<P><HI>'TIS humbly Hop'd and Pray'd, That our Honourable Repre&s;entatives, who are now (in pur&s;uance of His Gracious Maje&s;ties Me&s;&s;age to them) Con&s;idering of the mo&s;t proper Methods to Pre&s;erve, Improve, and Establi&s;h this Trade to a National Advantage, Will be plea&s;ed to Interpo&s;e with their prevalent Applications to His Maje&s;ty, to prevent &s;o great a Prejudice to the Publick, as mu&s;t unavoidably be the Con&s;equence of permitting the&s;e Ships to proceed; At least until it be fir&s;t effectually Provided,</HI> That they &s;hall carry out no Effects but what are intirely for Account of their <HI>General Ioynt-Stock,</HI> And give &s;ufficient Security to di&s;charge all Debts and Demands on them in <HI>India.</HI></P>
