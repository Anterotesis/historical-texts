<P>The immortall memory of <HI>Sultan Murat,</HI> Grand Seignor of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> our Predece&s;&s;our and beloved Brother, did alwayes intend to take from the Chri&s;tians their little Rocke, which is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e that are called by the name of <HI>Religion of Malta;</HI> and withall to &s;up|pre&s;&s;e their Gallies, becau&s;e of the continuall damage which they doe upon our Seas. And while&s;t the &s;aid Grand Seignor was bu&s;ie to bring his de&s;igne about, he dyed; Charging us to take this care upon us, which &s;o much the more willingly wee doe re&s;olve to put in exe|cution, becau&s;e the &s;aid Gallies not regarding our di&s;plea&s;ure, tooke not long &s;ince a Ship of ours, where the <HI>Sultan Se&s;era</HI> was, with the <HI>A|ga,</HI> who dyed in the fight, to our great griefe: therefore Wee Command all our <HI>Ba&s;haes</HI> in <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> and all the Kings, to be with their Gallies in a readine&s;&s;e the fir&s;t day of the full Moone, in the moneth of <HI>Aprill;</HI> And that all tho&s;e Gallies which are in our River of <HI>Arcenall,</HI> be &s;et out armed and ready at the &s;ame time; together with all the Shippes that are in our Harbours, and our whole <HI>Militia</HI> is to doe the &s;ame; for our Will is, That this our Armie &s;hall be the terrour, not onely to Chri&s;tendome, but
<PB N="3" REF="3">to the whole World, that by the multitude of our Gallies and Shippes, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, in admiration thereof &s;hall be changed; the Fi&s;hes &s;hall hide them&s;elves in the deepe&s;t bottome of the Sea, for the fearefull noi&s;e of our Ordnance, that the Bea&s;ts and the Forre&s;ts &s;hall be afraid, and the very trees rooted out and bea|ten downe; And all Chri&s;tendome &s;hall by this our great might feele our anger and wrath, for the lo&s;&s;e of our <HI>Sultan</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Aga.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>Sultan,</HI> by this his bla&s;phemous ma|nife&s;tation, declares as if he meant wholly to bend his force towards the I&s;le of <HI>Malta,</HI> not|with&s;tanding is entred in <HI>Candia,</HI> being the Do|minion of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> where he hath already taken &s;ome Forts, whereof &s;ome upon Compo|&s;ition; and notwith&s;tanding, after he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, hath put them mo&s;t treache|rou&s;ly to the &s;word without any mercy, which is not to be wondred at, by rea&s;on that the great <HI>Sultans,</HI> his Predece&s;&s;ours, when they made warre again&s;t the <HI>Venetians</HI> and <HI>Hungarians,</HI> did alwayes put them mo&s;t cruelly to the &s;word, whether they delivered their Townes up by Compo&s;ition, or otherwi&s;e. It is credibly re|ported by &s;ome that have been eye-witne&s;&s;es
<PB N="4" REF="4">thereof, that this Great <HI>Turkes</HI> Army con&s;i&s;ts of above 300000 men, whereof mo&s;t of them are Jani&s;aries; 6 great Galliones, that are of 1000 tunne each; 600 Gallies, 1000 &s;mall Boats to land men and ammunition with; 1500 Camels laden with Powder; Be&s;ides divers Ships from <HI>Algier,</HI> laden with all &s;orts of Ammunition, as &s;takes, nailes, Iron-workes, and &s;uch things as they commonly make u&s;e of, in&s;omuch as it is thought that they never came out with &s;uch a great Armie, as at this time. It is much to be wi&s;hed, that all Chri&s;tian Princes were reconci|led together, and endeavoured to joyne their Forces together, to oppo&s;e that cruell enemy that &s;eekes to make him&s;elfe Monarch of the World, and to bring the Chri&s;tians under his u&s;urping power.</P>
<P>By Letters from <HI>Venice</HI> it is certified, that their Shippes have met with &s;ome part of the <HI>Turkes</HI> Fleet, which were coming from <HI>Algier,</HI> and have fought with them, and have &s;unke twenty of their Gallies and foure of their men of Warre.</P>
<P>They make great preparations at <HI>Venice</HI> a|gain&s;t the <HI>Turke;</HI> many Chri&s;tian Princes offer their help to the utmo&s;t. By Letters from thence
<PB N="5" REF="4">it is certified thus; That the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour the Lord of <HI>Gremovilie,</HI> having made his pub|lick entry the 14^t^h of <HI>Iuly</HI> la&s;t, the next day after had Audience in the Councell, where he was received with great honour and having &s;hewed his Letters of Credit, made an Oration, offering in the behalfe of the King of <HI>France</HI> his Ma&s;ter, his utmo&s;t helpe in this Warre, which was re|ceived thankfully.</P>
<P>The great Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> hath likewi&s;e pre|&s;ented by his Amba&s;&s;adour, all his power, as well by land as by water, his Gallies, Shippes, Men, and his own per&s;on. The Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> that is there at pre&s;ent, offers 1500 Dragoones; 500 hor&s;e, and 3000 foot; it is &s;aid he &s;hall be Gene|rall, and &s;ent towards <HI>Palma.</HI> The great Ma&s;ter of <HI>Malta</HI> offers likewi&s;e 8000 Souldiers, and 2000 &s;laves. In the meane time, the Great <HI>Turke</HI> goeth on his way, bringing all under his Power where he comes, while&s;t they feed them&s;elves with the&s;e offers.</P>
