<P>_WHen the Cardinall of <HI>Strigonia</HI> vnder&s;tood hee &s;hould not be admitted to haue audience of the <HI>Pope</HI> as <HI>Imperiall</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, he did de&s;ire, that he might be heard by what Title &s;oever. Thus his Holine&s;&s;e gaue him audience, and his &s;peech and com|plaints did la&s;t almo&s;t two houres, where the <HI>Pope</HI> was &s;o troubled and wearied withall, that the Amba&s;&s;adour of <HI>To&s;ca|ny,</HI> comming in after that the &s;ayd Cardinall of <HI>Strigonia</HI> was gone, found the <HI>Pope</HI> &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed, that he could not treat a|bout any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, but onely entertained the <HI>Pope</HI> with &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;es, to make him merry againe. And the <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elfe (confe&s;&s;ing to be overwearied about the Cardinals propo&s;itions) departed afterwards out of <HI>Rome,</HI> retyring him&s;elfe into the Country, vpon the Patrimoniall land, lea|ving &s;trict order, that none &s;hould come thither for any ne|gotiation. He went away on Wedne&s;day morning, and will not returne till the twentieth of this Moneth of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>Foure Gentle-men of this Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> being cho&s;en by the Councell of the <HI>Campidoglio,</HI> haue beene with the <HI>Pope,</HI> to be&s;eech him, not to yeelde to the demands made for <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Austria,</HI> concerning the trea&s;ure of the Ca&s;tle. Where|upon the <HI>Pope</HI> with admirable eloquence (wherein indeede he doth excell) made a faire &s;peech in an&s;were, repre&s;enting with an exaggeration the favours formerly &s;hewed to the &s;ayd hou&s;e of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> in giving them &s;ums of
<PB N="2" REF="2"> monies amounting to many Millions, and there hee broke forth in teares, &s;aying: <HI>Pro gratiarum actione</HI> and for a re|compence, We finde now there is layd waite for our life; Our life is &s;ought for in our owne hou&s;e; And &s;hould We now giue to them the &s;u&s;tenance, the bowels, the blood of this Citie?

<HEAD>An extract of a Letter written at <HI>War&s;haw,</HI> <DATE>the 5. of Aprill, 1632.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Concerning the warre with <HI>Mu&s;covia,</HI> it is thought it can|not be &s;hunned. Therefore there are tenne thou&s;and men to march towards the limits, to ob&s;erue what the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> intend to doe, and (if it be po&s;&s;ible) to make &s;ome longer truce, or finding the contrary, to &s;end quickly word thereof hither to the Court. In which ca&s;e, there &s;hall be more forces &s;ent thi|therwards, and the Prince al&s;o is then to carrie &s;ome troopes, (&s;ome &s;peake of 12000. men) and joyne with the former, and &s;o with&s;tand the &s;aid <HI>Mu&s;covits:</HI> And according as the
<PB N="3" REF="2"> enemie &s;hall be found &s;trong, &s;o tho&s;e of <HI>Littaw</HI> &s;hall then helpe accordingly. And to this end both the <HI>Polonians</HI> and <HI>Li|thuanians</HI> haue graunted a Sub&s;idie of <HI>two pobores,</HI> whereof two are to bee paid pre&s;ently, and two about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> next.</P>
<P>As for the children of our late Queene, the States of <HI>Po|land,</HI> haue taken &s;o good an order that they are now &s;uffici|ently prouided for, to the great contentment of the King. For Prince <HI>Iohn Albert,</HI> who is an Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall per&s;on, hee is to haue the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Cracow:</HI> And although there was no mention or expre&s;&s;ion made of the other Church-man, to witt, of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Neis:</HI> Yet neuer|thele&s;&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed, hee &s;hall haue that of <HI>Ermband,</HI> which the &s;econd Prince hath hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. And as for the two politick Princes, named, <HI>Ca&s;imerus</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> and likewi&s;e the Prince&s;&s;e their Si&s;ter, among&s;t them the goods both moueables and immoueables, as <HI>Chivaza, Galbe, Stra&s;|burg</HI> and what el&s;e &s;hee did injoye both in <HI>Poland</HI> and in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> &s;hall bee divided; according as his Maje&s;tie &s;hall thinke be&s;t to giue order for. At this free offer of the States the King hath taken much content, and to &s;hew him&s;elfe thankfull for &s;uch an vnexpected bounty and libe|rality, he hath both thanked them and &s;urrendered &s;ome re|venues, which before were accounted among&s;t the due rents, to returne after his death vnto the States of the Kingdom: &amp; the &s;aid lands are granted vnto the &s;aid princes with con|dition, that after their death they doe returne to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of certaine noblemen.</P>
<P>By this meanes the Prince <HI>Ratziville,</HI> is come againe in|to great fauor of the olde King, becau&s;e he tooke great paines to haue the &s;aid Princes all well provided, according to right and rea&s;on (as he &s;aid) &s;eeing the King their father neg|lecting and loon&s;ig his owne hereditary dominions came &s;o freely and contented him&s;elfe with the Electiue king|dome. As for the matter of Coynes and the monie &s;o much complained of, it is referred to the next Parliament, and re|maines meane while in the olde e&s;tate.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>And concerning the point of <HI>Inter-regnum</HI> and gouernment if the King &s;hould bee too &s;icke or dye, it hath al&s;o beene delayed and left to &s;ome other Parliament. Becau&s;e many of the Burge&s;&s;es had no in&s;truction about that affaire, and o|thers did conceiue, that his Maje&s;tie did intend to put the governement into the hands of his &s;onne <HI>Ca&s;imer,</HI> and &s;o to procure him the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crowne wherunto there is no likelyhood the States will euer giue their con&s;ent. The re&s;t of what was done, you will find in the printed con|clu&s;ion of this parliament, which to make an end, &s;pent three dayes, by rea&s;on that the good olde King was not able to fit &s;o long.</P>

<P>Since my la&s;t which was of the 5. of this moneth, our King fell againe very &s;icke, and becau&s;e he often did rcover, we had no great feare he &s;hould as yet die: but it was Gods plea&s;ure to take him away on this very day, which is the 29. of <HI>A|prill:</HI> I cannot tell you at this time other particularities about his death, for I haue my &s;elfe beene not well the&s;e many daies, and therefore beene ab&s;ent from Court. I will therefore on|ly tell you, that although there was hitherto no doubt, but the States would without any great con&s;ultation or con&s;ide|ration make choi&s;e of the elde&s;t Prince <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> to make him King of <HI>Poland.</HI> Yet neverthele&s;&s;e I am at this very in|&s;tant informed from a very good hand, that the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> (the Emperors brother) hath (during the &s;ickne&s;&s;e of our late King) made him&s;elfe a great partie, who intends to &s;tand for him to make him King: There are al&s;o others that ayme another way: I pray God to keepe vs from di&s;&s;ention among our &s;elues; and I hope yet, that our Prince (again&s;t whom there can be no exception at all) &s;hall bee our King, and &s;o we &s;hall remaine in quietne&s;&s;e whereof (God willing) I will giue you an account by my next.</P>

<P>Here is now againe an indifferent calme, and the boi&s;te|rous tempe&s;t is &s;omwhat cea&s;ed through the death of the <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> who was taken hold on the 21. of this mounth and the day following had halfe his head &s;trooke off, and afterwards tyed by the leggs and drawne vp and hanged on the tree before the gate of the Palace of the <HI>Vizeer</HI> where the <HI>Ianizary Aga</HI> was hanged. Which cau&s;ed great joy and acclamation among the people, not onely the Militarie, but all Nations and &s;orts of people, of what ranke &s;oever, dwel|ling within this Citie. The con&s;ultation and plot was con|cluded and agreeed vpon by the great Turke or Emperour, &amp; the three lately murdered per&s;ons, namely thus; pre&s;ently vp|on the tydings of the death of the depo&s;ed <HI>&V;izeer,</HI> al&s;o to di&s;patch and make away the now raigning <HI>Rogieb Bas&s;ha.</HI> The <HI>Tefterdar &V;izeer,</HI> the <HI>Ianizar Aga,</HI> Captaine <HI>Bas&s;ha</HI> or Ad|mirall of the Sea, and to make the <HI>Chamberlaine Muza Qui|lebij, Ianizar Aga.</HI> And afterward by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance (or at lea&s;t permi&s;&s;ion) of the other <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> (whom they thought ge|nerally to corrupt with great gifts and briberies) to ma&s;&s;acre all the <HI>Syphahies,</HI> by that meanes to confirme the authoritie of the Emperour, or great <HI>Turke,</HI> and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is received for a generall opinion, that the <HI>&V;izeer,</HI> who fir&s;t broached this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e and plotted this mi&s;chiefe, is fal|len in great di&s;ta&s;te &amp; di&s;grace with the great <HI>Turke</HI> or Emp: however it doth not yet bur&s;t forth or appeare; but in the meane time there is a vigilant eye over him. And that his <HI>Im|periall</HI> Maje&s;tie when time &s;hall &s;erue (to wit, as &s;oone as the <HI>Syphahies</HI> &s;hall be de&s;troyed) will make the world &s;en&s;ible of his re&s;entment and affection of the &s;aid plot, which he cannot but take to heart, and will plenarily take his opportune re|venge: Although the afore-&s;ayd <HI>Vizeer</HI> is one of the be&s;t and
<PB N="6" REF="4"> able&s;t men, which this Empire hath produced this long time, and <HI>(quod rarum est)</HI> is generally beloved and affected of all Nations and all people.</P>

The whole Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e&s;ingen</HI> is freely yeelded vp to his Maie&s;ty and payd him contribution.

But &s;ome of our forces which are already &s;ent again&s;t them wil &s;oone coole their courage,</P>
<P>This weeke the aforementioned Boores did ouercome and &s;urpri&s;e 50. <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> &s;oldiers. <HI>Crabates,</HI> betweene <HI>Shro|benhou&s;en</HI> and <HI>Sticha.</HI> The&s;e Boores when they had ma&s;te|red them, did cut off their eares and no&s;es, chopt off their hands and feete, &amp; put out their eyes&punc; and &s;o left them, the&s;e deuili&s;h Boores doe great mi&s;chiefe of the like nature. As &s;oone as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was aduerti&s;ed of the cruell in|&s;olencies of tho&s;e Boores&punc; hee was much di&s;plea&s;ed, and &s;o much the more, becau&s;e he &s;aw that his &s;oldiers would not put it vp&punc; but pre&s;ently cryed reuenge and fired their villa|ges, in&s;omuch that in one day there were &s;eene two hun|dred &s;euerall fires blazing at once.</P>
