It is not onely &s;trange, but likewi&s;e incredible, to beleeue, how many &s;undry and new Workes here are dayly made to defend the Citie; as likewi&s;e, what rare Weapons here are inuented to be v&s;ed. When the Enemies a&s;&s;ault our Workes, as &s;trange Tru&s;hes to knocke the Climbers downe, and Hookes to pierce their Bodyes, and draw them vpon the Walls &s;udden|ly. To be briefe, vnle&s;&s;e God be di&s;po&s;ed to puni&s;h our &s;innes, the Towne hath no rea&s;on to feare the Siege.

<HEAD>&para; A TRVE DELINEATION AND De&s;cription of the great Fight or Battell fought the 29. of Augu&s;t, 1622. betwixt Count <HI>Mans|field</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> on the one &s;ide, and <HI>Don Gonzales de Cordua</HI> on the other &s;ide; betwixt <HI>Gem|blours</HI> and <HI>Flory.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> hoping, that by the inter|ce&s;&s;ion and intermedling of his Maie&s;tie of <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> an agreement &s;hould be made betwixt the Emperour, the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and him; he retyred with his Army out of the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> and pa&s;|&s;ing through <HI>Al&s;atia, Strasburg,</HI> and <HI>Lotteringia,</HI> arriued at la&s;t at <HI>Sedan,</HI> where hee di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, &s;taying him&s;elfe by his Vnckle, the Duke of <HI>Bouillon.</HI> Where|upon the Army being &s;et at libertie, re&s;olued to &s;erue the States of the Vnited Prouinces, and to march thi|ther through the Prouinces belonging vnto the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> being conducted by Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> and the Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;wick.</HI> The <HI>Infanta</HI> hauing notice of this De&s;igne, commanded <HI>Don Cordua</HI> in all ha&s;te to come with his Forces out of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> to re&s;i&s;t this Army; and cau&s;ed likewi&s;e, to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, a great number of Boores to be in Armes. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> perceiuing certaine Boores vpon the way, at his fir&s;t entry of the Low-Countries, would not med|dle with them, &s;aying, That it would be no credite for him to fight with Boores. But &s;one after, wee met with twelue Companies of Boores, which would &s;top our pa&s;&s;age. Whereupon Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> commanded a field-Piece with &s;mal Bullets to be di&s;charged again&s;t them; whereupon they fled, and retyred into a Wood.
<PB N="13" REF="9">And Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> as likewi&s;e the Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> commanded the Villages thereabouts to be fired; which was al&s;o performed. This was ten Leagues from <HI>Gemblours;</HI> where we receiued <HI>Don Cordua's</HI> Let|ter, declaring, that hee was re&s;olued to fight with vs. Whereupon wee e&s;pying afterwards <HI>Don Gonzales</HI> Campe, wee &s;et our Forces in Battell-array. Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> a&s;&s;aulted the enemie fir&s;t with 600. hor&s;e: The Count of <HI>Styrum</HI> followed pre&s;ently with his Regi|ment; the like did Count <HI>Harman,</HI> and diuer&s;e other Counts and Lords: afterwards Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> the Count of <HI>Ottenburg,</HI> the <HI>Rhinegraue,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Ploech,</HI> euery one with their &s;eueral Regiments came to &s;econd the other; as likewi&s;e the Regiment of the Duke of <HI>Saxon, Weymar,</HI> and the Landgraue of <HI>He&s;&s;en;</HI> and they fell &s;o valiantly vpon the enemie, that they cau&s;ed him to retire. At the fir&s;t encounter, the Hor&s;e of the ene|mie fled, whereupon we a&s;&s;aulted his Foot; and Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and Count <HI>Harman,</HI> went to take the Ord|nance of the enemie: which they did, and cau&s;ed them twice to be di&s;charged vpon our enemies, hoping that our Foot would haue come on, but did not; &s;o that we were forced afterwards to leaue them againe: Neuer|thele&s;&s;e, our two Peeces played vpon the enemies Foot without mi&s;&s;ing; and their Ordnance did not annoy vs, becau&s;e it &s;tood too high, and &s;hot ouer our Camp. In the meane time, the Count of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> the Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Ottenburg</HI> rode about the Army, encouraging the Souldiers to fight valiantly, and did them&s;elues the like; by rea&s;on whereof, diuer&s;e Lords and Officers on our &s;ide are hurt, but few &s;laine. Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> had on his backe a White Sattin Dou|blet, and a Blew Feather vpon his head; and hauing his
<PB N="14" REF="10">&s;leeues drawne vp, hee &s;la&s;hed brauely among the ene|mies with his Sword, but was afterwards hurt with a &s;hot in his Arme. On the enemies &s;ide, there are di|uers Commanders, and a great number of the com|mon Souldiers &s;laine, and notwith&s;tanding wee haue lo&s;t many, they haue lo&s;t more, and (God be pray&s;ed) wee haue gotten the victorie.</P>
<P>The Battell being ended, wee were &s;o wearie, that wee could not pur&s;ue our victorie, and our Hor&s;es could not &s;tand almo&s;t any longer vpon their legges; which cau&s;ed vs to re&s;t for a while, and to refre&s;h our &s;elues: and the Duke being yet in heat, was conducted out of the Campe at the &s;ame time by the Count of <HI>Styrum,</HI> and two Gentlemen. But afterwards, wee marching againe in Battell-array were within the &s;pace of a League encountred with diuer&s;e Boores, and o|thers, which would &s;toppe our pa&s;&s;age: but wee &s;et vpon them, and &s;lew foure hundred of the &s;ame; the re&s;t wee bere&s;t the next Morning of their Apparrell and Armes. And from thence wee went &s;traight on, ta|king our way towards <HI>Tongeren,</HI> where wee &s;trengthe|ned our &s;elues a little, and tarryed a while for the Hor&s;e and Foot which were behind; and our Hor&s;e being well accompanied, marched the &s;ame Night within &s;ix Leagues of <HI>Breda.</HI></P>
