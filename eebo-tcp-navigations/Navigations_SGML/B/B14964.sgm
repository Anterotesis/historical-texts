<P>_THere is nothing that makes men more commenda|ble before the face of Heauen and Earth, in compa|ri&s;on of true fidelity towards God and their Prince. It is a Primitive vertue which is borne with vs, and ought not to die but with vs without prejudice or wrong to any forraine Nations, it may bee averr'd with preemi|nence of honour, that there is not any place or Nation, where the Divine wor&s;hip is more religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, the Churches better maintayned and &s;erved, the Cleargy more exemplary, the Nobi|lity more pious, the people more devout and ob&s;ervant in reli|gious duties, than in tho&s;e Provinces of the Low-countries which are &s;ubject and obedient to his Maje&s;ty.

<P>Our enemies are &s;o much the more dangerous, by how much more they doe flatter vs. And as the promi&s;e of liberty of con|&s;cience is nothing el&s;e but an Introduction of here&s;ie: So is the other of publike liberty tendered by the hand of a di&s;loyall one, no|thing el&s;e but a deceitfull bayte to replunge our Provinces into the fore-pa&s;&s;ed calamities, out of which the mercy of the Omnipotent hath delivered and brought vs forth. Our &s;weetne&s;&s;e (GOD bee ble&s;sed) is not mixed with any bitterne&s;&s;e, our Sacrifices are not intertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">bed or troubled, our lives pa&s;&s;e along in tranquility, and under the manifold ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, under the example and government of a Prince&s;&s;e mo&s;t devout and debonayre, and hope and expectation of a young Prince of Royall race. What is there now wanting to the height of our happine&s;&s;e, but the accompli&s;h|ment of a Peace, which cannot be with-held from us, if wee make but &s;ome tryall and proofe worthy of our zeale and good will? We can doe much, if wee have but the will: onely let us have this care, that the want of courage turne not to our reproach &amp; &s;hame, &s;ince that our dome&s;ticke enemies are di&s;cryed &amp; brought to light, tho&s;e without &s;halbe inferiour to us. Our dome&s;ticke enemies are &s;uch, who under colour and pretence of ray&s;ing up the publike liberty, labour and endeavour to de&s;troy it by inovation, and bury the &s;ame in their owne ambitious engro&s;&s;ing. And who having no other Religion but that of their ambition and of their owne inte|re&s;t, doe neverthele&s;&s;e make profe&s;&s;ion of being very good Catho|lickes.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t cau&s;e that ever was in the world wanted not &s;ome pretence or other. There is nothing &s;o like unto an Angell of light as a <HI>Daemon</HI> or Devill, nothing doth &s;o counterfeyte, and appeare like unto the truth as fal&s;hood &amp; a lye. You have (my Lords) &s;eene the ridiculous pretences of Count <HI>Henry de Bergh</HI> in tho&s;e Letters which hee hath &s;ent to her highne&s;&s;e, to the States of the Coun|trey, and the declaration which he made to &s;ollicite the fidelity of &s;oldiers and men of honour. You have &s;eene I &s;ay, his foundation without foundation, upon the which he grounds his perver&s;e in|tentions. But the di&s;like and di&s;ta&s;t which you have taken again&s;t his proceedings hath beene &s;uch, and your loyalty and fidelity &s;o commendable, that even to convince his felony, you have (with an
<PB N="5" REF="3">extraordinary affection, &amp; love to the good of the Countrey) con|tributed unto the Prince farre greater ayde and helpe than former|ly you had done. Moreover it is nece&s;&s;ary that be&s;ides you, the world be &s;atisfied, which oftentimes doth judge by the outward appearance, not knowing the truth of things, and that the &s;ame may &s;ee the truth di&s;covered, le&s;t men be abu&s;ed by the cunning &s;lights and pretences where withall he hides the gro&s;&s;ene&s;&s;e and ba&s;ene&s;&s;e of his trea&s;on. He begins his letter written to her high|ne&s;&s;e with in&s;upportable and boldne&s;&s;e without mea&s;ure, pre&s;en|ting mo&s;t traytour-like bread in one hand, and a flinty &s;tone in the other. He expo&s;eth his wicked de&s;ignes with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Never I am &s;ure, was there any rebellion declared with more &s;hamele&s;|ne&s;&s;e and impudency. After this his fayned Ceremony and com|plement, he <HI>complaineth, that the Souldiers were withdrawne from his government, to the end that they might make him be the cau&s;e of their de&s;truction.</HI> It is lawfull for a man to make his complaint but not perfidious. That which he &s;ayes is not truth, and the Letters of the Marqui&s;e <HI>De Sancte Croes</HI> doe te&s;tifie as much for he required no men from him, <HI>but onely beacu&s;e he judged that the enemy would at|tempt nothing on that &s;ide, leaving all to his owne choi&s;e and de&s;iring him to &s;ee the Bridge well guarded and provided before</HI> Venlo, <HI>to &s;uf|fer the troupes to pa&s;&s;e over &s;afely which &s;hould be &s;eat to relieve the &s;ame.</HI> And put the ca&s;e, that which he affirmeth were true, if hee had beene well minded, and his intention good, he ought to have defended her government to the la&s;t man, and have kept him&s;elfe in the City of <HI>Gelder</HI> which is a &s;trong place, (as he had promi&s;ed by Letters to her highne&s;&s;e, and allowing that <HI>Venlo</HI> was able to be held) &amp; therein have imitated the genero&s;ity of his Brother Count <HI>Frederick,</HI> who in the yeare 1597. defended him&s;elfe within the City <HI>Lingen,</HI> even to the extreamity, with onely three Companies of foote and one of Hor&s;e. But this, two dayes before the enemie did come before <HI>Venlo,</HI> called the Magi&s;trates and told them, that the city would &s;oon be be&s;ieged, &amp; to take away the courage from the Citizens demon&s;trated unto them the &s;mall appearance and hope he had of defending the &s;ame. Wherefore hee excu&s;ed him|&s;elfe from protecting of them, nay and be&s;ides this being Gover|nour of that Province, &s;aid he had other places to guard &amp; looke to,
<PB N="6" REF="4">neverthele&s;&s;e he pre&s;ently made ha&s;t unto the City <HI>Gelder,</HI> from whence he departed pre&s;ently accompanied onely with one &s;er|vant, or Companion, &amp; betooke him&s;elfe to <HI>Liege,</HI> there to put in execution the perfidiou&s;ne&s;&s;e which he had plodded a long time.</P>
<P>As <HI>for his &s;ervice of forty yeares,</HI> which he mentions: Tis true, in the beginning they were con&s;iderable, and of &s;ome worth when his brother (who&s;e death he doth alleadge) did animate him by their good and valerous examples. But ever &s;ince, from the yeare 1606 that he defended the City <HI>Groll</HI> with expectation of reliefe by the Marqui&s;e <HI>Spinola</HI> who came time enough to re&s;cue him, his &s;ervices have not beene &s;o remarkeable nor of &s;uch moment, and moreover they have beene recompenced an hundred fold with dignities and titles, gifts, and honourable charges, and exce&s;&s;ive &s;ummes of Money.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the ill government of the Countryes,</HI> and the progre&s;se of our enemies, that proceeds from nothing el&s;e but from the mani|fold treacheries, and the to too much confidence and tru&s;t which our Princes have in his per&s;on, having with a fatherly and favoura|ble affection which they bare unto their &s;ervants, indured a long time his di&s;contentments, and greevances, which in time by little and little, and more and more are &s;till degenerated unto this action the mo&s;t ba&s;e and ignoble that ever could bee returned with re|proach unto a rea&s;onable Soule, manife&s;ted in the&s;e two branches, ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">atitude, and revolt.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t te&s;timonies of his di&s;loyall and evill will which he cunningly concealed, was ob&s;erved at <HI>Bergen on Zoom</HI> in the yeare 1622. for then and here having received command reitera|ted by her Highne&s;se, to conduct the Marqui&s;e <HI>Spinola</HI> with all di|ligence unto the Army which he than had on the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> hee made a thou&s;and excu&s;es to prolong the time, and &s;tay him or keepe him backe untill the want of reliefe cau&s;ed us to ray&s;e the &s;iege. And it was told the Marqui&s;e than, (who was in travaile with im|patiency, during this delay) by the Lieutenant of the Artillery, <HI>Wyn|gart</HI> by name, that he would loo&s;e his head, if Count <HI>Henry de Bergh</HI> (whom he had knowne by long experience) did arriue, before the occa&s;ion &s;hould be let &s;lip.</P>
<P>He thought to have played the &s;ame prancke two yeares after,
<PB N="7" REF="4">in like manuer to divert the &s;iege of <HI>Breda,</HI> making profer of an en|terpri&s;e upon <HI>Raven&s;teyn,</HI> afterward upon the <HI>Grave,</HI> and la&s;tly up|on the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Genepe.</HI> The cunning Letters which after his &s;ub|tile manner he wrote full of excu&s;es, have &s;ufficiently di&s;covered what was his de&s;igne. They are printed at large, in the hi&s;tory of the &s;iege of <HI>Breda,</HI> compo&s;ed and &s;et forth by Father <HI>Hermanus Hugo.</HI></P>
<P>The confidence which her Highne&s;&s;e had euer &s;ince in his fide|lity for the releeuing of <HI>Groll.</HI> In the yeare 1627. was the cau&s;e why wee lo&s;t that City. For being there was a difference ri&s;en betweene two Mai&s;ters of the Campe, for the vantguard, being of different Nations, hee in&s;tead that hee &s;hould haue rid them out of the Field, and done as it befitted him for his Maie&s;ties &s;ervice, hee coun&s;els the one not to yeild to the other, by that meanes in the meane time, to prevent them both from defeating a Convoy which ea&s;ed and refre&s;hed the Enemie, for want of which Con|voy the Enemie mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity haue rai&s;ed the &s;iege. Hee was put to his excu&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> quitted becau&s;e his authority was not great enough for the deciding the preeminence of Nations, But let vs &s;ee, if hee hath better be haued him&s;elfe when hee had receiued more authority. The City named <HI>Shortogenbo&s;ch,</HI> was be&s;ieged by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in the yeare of our Lord 1629. Wee than prai&s;ed God, becau&s;e the Enemie was fallen before a City which was able to defend it &s;elfe and hold out vntill releife &s;hould come. Her Highne&s;&s;e at that time v&s;ed &s;o much diligence, that in few dayes wee had a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Army on Foote and able to make a &s;trong a&s;&s;ault. There was onely que&s;tion made, who &s;hould command the &s;ame, the Marquis <HI>Spinola</HI> than being ab&s;ent. In the end this was the re&s;olution that Count <HI>Henry de Bergh</HI> &s;hould haue the honour, and to this end hee was &s;ent for by her Highne&s;&s;e. No &s;ooner was hee come to <HI>Bruxels,</HI> but hee be|gan to propound an hundred difficulties one after another, and frame excu&s;es, to the end that the Enemie might gaine the more time to fortifie them&s;elues. In the&s;e extremicies, and by rea&s;on of the confidence which wee had in him, and partly by rea&s;on of his experience nothing was denied him which hee demanded. Many dayes pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e entermedlings, but in the end hee
<PB N="8" REF="5">goes to Field, and was by the way (&s;o great ha&s;t he made) from the 3. of <HI>June</HI> to the 27. and than hee found that the be&s;ieged had not yet lo&s;t one Inch of ground of all their outworkes, although the quarters of the Enemie were in good rea&s;onable defence. The advice of the mo&s;t part of the Colonels was to open Trench a|gain&s;t trench, and weary out the enimie in &s;uch &s;ort, that hee &s;hould not bee able to di&s;quiet the be&s;ieged, and &s;o expect vntill the Autumne &s;hould bee pa&s;t, and than the waters would cau&s;e him to depart of his owne accord, or at the lea&s;twi&s;e bee con|&s;trained to for&s;ake &s;ome quarter or other, by which meanes wee might haue a way opened to bring in Munition, and &s;oldiers and nece&s;&s;aries, as much as &s;hould be required for the deliuerance of the City. Count <HI>Henry</HI> cannot approue this enterpri&s;e, indeed hee made tryall of &s;ome others, in tho&s;e places which were mo&s;t fortified, and contented him&s;elfe with this conclu&s;ion, that the Enemies trenches were not po&s;&s;ible to bee entred. Hauing there|fore intended a diuer&s;ion of his Army hee leaues the &s;iege, and &s;ends to hazard the pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> by <HI>Lucas Cayro,</HI> who ha|uing pa&s;&s;ed happily, hee followed him, and ioynes the Imperi|all Army with theirs, which Army was come for our aid and re|liefe. And what doth hee than? hee begins to treat with the Burgomai&s;ters of Cities, onely to repleni&s;h his owne Coffers, and fami&s;h the faire&s;t and compleate&s;t Army which had beene &s;eene in a long time, in &s;tead of demanding vp tho&s;e places where there were neither &s;oldiers nor munition, and which doubtle&s;&s;e would haue &s;urrendred at the very &s;ight of a &s;tock of a tree, or the &s;mal|le&s;t and &s;imple&s;t &s;troake which could haue beene made at them.</P>
<P>You &s;hall ob&s;erue, if you plea&s;e, an excu&s;able perfidiou&s;ne&s;&s;e. When <HI>Lucas Cayro</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Y&s;&s;ell.</HI> Contrary to the opinion of Count <HI>Henry,</HI> and that the terrour of an explioct &s;o newly put in practice, and not fore&s;eeene had a&s;toni&s;hed all <HI>Holland.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hauing a&s;&s;embled the whole Councell, and pro|pounded vnto them what had &s;o lately and vnexpectedly happe|ned, put into deliberation whether the &s;iege &s;hould bee ray&s;ed yea or no. The aduice and opinion of all the Councell, and each of them was, that the <HI>Veluwee</HI> being thus occupied and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed vnexpectedly, the Cities of <HI>Arnheym, Amersfort, Doesburgh,
<PB N="7" REF="5">Wageningen, Rhenen,</HI> and other neare adioyning places about the <HI>Veluwee</HI> would bee taken without any re&s;i&s;tance at all, and that the gaine and profit which they &s;hould make of <HI>Shertogenbo&s;ch</HI> could not countervaile nor recompence the lea&s;t of all tho&s;e lo&s;|&s;es, which they &s;hould &s;uffer el&s;ewhere, if their enimie were per|mitted to ceaze vpon the very heart of the Country. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> did very much commend the advice of the&s;e Coun&s;el|lors, and &s;aid, that verily &s;ome cour&s;e mu&s;t bee taken, if that which they obiected mu&s;t needs fall out &s;o, but hee could a&s;&s;ure them to the contrary, and that the event would proue otherwi&s;e. And from whom I pray, could he haue this knowledge and a&s;&s;u|rance but from Count <HI>Henry De Bergh,</HI> who in effect neuer made &s;o much as any &s;hew of demanding vp any City. Who within his owne view permitted the City <HI>Desburgh</HI> to be revictualled, and that was the cau&s;e that &s;ome poore <HI>Hollanders</HI> were executed being Catholicks, becau&s;e they had declared and manife&s;ted the intelligence which hee had receiued from them priuately. In a word <HI>Shertogenb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ch</HI> was not releiued, and in effect nothing could be expected on his part &s;ince he had engaged him&s;elfe by promi&s;e to his &s;i&s;ters not to re&s;eue the &s;ame.</P>
<P>What water can wa&s;h him cleare from the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>We&s;el,</HI> which was taken from vs at the &s;ame time? &s;eeing that as &s;oone as euer he heard of the newes, hee kept him&s;elfe &s;hut vp in his Chamber for 24. houres together, for feare lea&s;t hee &s;hould bee required to &s;end help to recouer the &s;ame City; and when as Count <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> hauing intreated him to furni&s;h him with men, to re|gaine that place, before the open breach where the Enemie en|tred, was made vp, hee refu&s;ed it. The Gouernour of <HI>Diden</HI> hath &s;poken it to Count <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> with his owne mouth that if hee had come to releiue the City of <HI>We&s;ell</HI> any time within fiue dayes after the &s;ame was taken hee might haue entred without a|ny difficulty. If Count <HI>Henry</HI> had beene an hone&s;t man, wee had fini&s;hed our warre that yeare, and the Catholicke Religion, (with which cloake hee hides his ba&s;ene&s;&s;e, and the blackne&s;&s;e of his Hypocri&s;ie) had neuer &s;uffered &s;o much as the &s;ame hath done e|uer &s;ince.</P>
<P>What wonders hath hee wrought? where are the great ex|ploicts
<PB N="8" REF="6">of his Conque&s;ts? Let this al&s;o moreouer bee &s;poken for <HI>the great &s;eruices</HI> which hee alleageth in Generall. Hee him&s;elfe hath oftentimes avouched, that he neuer hath receiued wound or hurt in the Kings &s;eruice (notwith&s;tanding that &s;ome Hi&s;tories and report would haue made him beleeue that hee was once hurt in the leg or thigh, in a skirmi&s;h neere vnto <HI>Ruremond</HI> in the yeare 1598.) which hee attributed to a Mandegloire, or little figure or &s;hape of a man, which hee ordinarily carried in a &s;mall box, very durty and foule, which he hath &s;hewed to more than one per&s;on.</P>
<P>Indeed his &s;eruices are well knowne, if euer any mans were; hee entred very poore into the &s;ervice of our Princes, and now at this in&s;tant hee is &s;o rich that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth millions. From a par|ticular Hor&s;eman, and meane&s;t of his hou&s;e, hee was advanced to the greate&s;t offices which any &s;ervant of his Maie&s;ty could a&s;pire vnto. And therefore hee hath great rea&s;on to &s;ay, <HI>that the Nobi|lity is not in that e&s;teeme as they ought to bee;</HI> &s;eeing that the Ho|nours, Offices, and Dignities are &s;o ill be&s;towed; and that hee a|lone doth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e that, which a dozen others better de&s;eruing than him&s;elfe would e&s;teeme them&s;elues happy to enioy. God bee thanked there are none that are vnprovided, and not one who hath ju&s;t cau&s;e to complaine.</P>
<P>Are they not farre engaged and employed in the hou&s;e, and &s;er|vice of their Soueraigne? Doe not they hold the mo&s;t part of the Gouernments? Who doe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the principall Offices, and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall Dignities but tho&s;e of the Low-Countryes? If the <HI>Spani&s;h, whom Count Henry vpbraides to bee the &s;ole Gouernours</HI> haue any part in the Government, and charge, it is for to expo&s;e their liues for our pre&s;eruation, and proceeds from the great care which the King hath for our protection.
