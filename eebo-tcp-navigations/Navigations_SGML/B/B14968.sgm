<HEAD>A SHORT RELATION OR IOVRNALL Of that famous Siege of MASTRICHT.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter that his Excellencie the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had a&s;&s;embled his Forces aboue <HI>Nymegen,</HI> and the generall day of Fa&s;ting &amp; Prayers was pa&s;t in the Vnited Provinces, for the good &s;ucce&s;&s;e of his Excellencies enterpri&s;es: our Army marched in|continently towards <HI>&V;enlo,</HI> a place of &s;trength and importance, and a Citi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Gelderland</HI> From hence his Excellency &s;ent one part of his Army towards <HI>Reremond,</HI> and another troope to <HI>Strallen,</HI> to attache tho&s;e three places, being vnfurni&s;hed of men and nece&s;&s;aries; at the &s;ame time by this meanes to di|&s;tract the Forces of our enemies. It &s;o fell out, that within few dayes tho&s;e three places yeelded vpon faire Conditions, which cau&s;ed his Excellency to leaue therein the publike ex|erci&s;e of their Religion in all their Churches; one excepted in every Towne, where our Reformed haue their publike ex|erci&s;e: by this meanes to make the re&s;t of the Cities of <HI>Bra|bant,</HI> to &s;ubmit to his favourable victorious Armes. We haue not lo&s;t any man of note before tho&s;e Cities, &s;aue onely that renowned and mo&s;t valiant Captaine, a true pillar of the
<PB N="2" REF="3">Church in the <HI>Low Countryes,</HI> Count <HI>Ernest</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> who&s;e lo&s;&s;e in &s;o dangerous times is aboue our expre&s;&s;ions. But his Excellencie a&s;cribing this vnmatcheable lo&s;&s;e of &s;o faithfull an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the fatall de&s;tiny of Heaven, and &s;ur|mounting his naturall affections with Chri&s;tian patience and re&s;olution, was not di&s;couraged by that vnhappie Re|encounter &s;o met withall in his fir&s;t &s;etting forth, but rather re&s;olved to revenge that breach made in his owne bloud: and went &s;peedily towards <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> a neutrall Towne, from thence &s;ending &s;ome Troopes to <HI>Syttart,</HI> a Towne in <HI>Gullickland,</HI> tooke it, and put a garri&s;on into it.</P>
<P>In the meane time that we &s;pent our time about <HI>Ma|&s;eick</HI> two or three dayes, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Forces and reliefe came into <HI>Ma&s;tricht</HI> about two thou&s;and men, pickt out and cho|&s;en out of all the old Companyes that were in the Kings &s;er|vice, vnder valiant and &s;tout Commaunders: the mo&s;t of them having beene in the Towne of <HI>Shertogenbo&s;h</HI> when it was be&s;ieged: &s;o that if we had come but three or foure dayes &s;ooner before the Towne, we might haue made a better bar|gaine, and &s;ooner gotten into that bloudy Citie. But the Lords Coun&s;aile being aboue our conceptions, it was fatall to many noble &s;pirits to haue <HI>Ma&s;tricht</HI> the Towne of their va|liant actions: &s;o that wee delaying our March till that time, came not before the Citie vntill the tenth of <HI>Iune</HI> towardes <HI>Lake,</HI> where his Excellency came very neare the Towne with hor&s;e and foote, within le&s;&s;e then a Musket-&s;hot from the walles, they within not &s;paring their Ordnance, but well|comming vs with great and &s;mall &s;hot without cea&s;ing, not without great lo&s;&s;e of ours. That night and day following, the Quarters were divided, the fir&s;t bartery ray&s;ed, which gaue the Towne the Signall of a Sutor with three demy Canons, being an&s;wered with twelue of theirs.</P>
<P>Before I come to relate &s;ome particulars, giue me leaue to tell you in what condition the Towne and our Army was at the fir&s;t, and how wee did lodge vs round about that va&s;t Chaos of <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> and <HI>Wyck. Ma&s;tricht, (Trajectum
<PB N="3" REF="3">ad Mo&s;am)</HI> is an old and famous Citie in <HI>Brabant,</HI> in the bor|ders of it towards <HI>Luykeland,</HI> and the Dukedome <HI>Limborg</HI> in one &s;ide, and the Land of <HI>Gulick</HI> on the other, devided in|to two Cities by the River of <HI>Ma&s;e,</HI> that floweth through it: whereof the one is called <HI>Ma&s;tricht</HI> on <HI>Brabant</HI> &s;ide, belonging to the King of <HI>Spaine;</HI> the other <HI>Wyck</HI> in <HI>Luyke|land</HI>-&s;ide, heretofore a neutrall Towne, and belonging to the Citie of <HI>Luyke,</HI> but by rea&s;on of &s;cituation and commodi|ou&s;ne&s;&s;e, taken in and kept by the Kings Garri&s;on. The Towne is governed by their Burgomai&s;ters and Senate, and hath many priviledges aboue other Townes: as being the <HI>Magazin</HI> of all <HI>Brabant,</HI> full of Churches and Colled|ges of men and women. The Garri&s;on was heretofore commanded by a Governour, one Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Motterie,</HI> an old &s;ervant to the King: but being commaunded to goe vp with the Kings Forces into the <HI>Palatinate</HI> the la&s;t Win|ter, vnder the commaund of Don <HI>Cordova,</HI> he could not come backe againe into the Towne before the Siege, but was forced to looke vpon his Government with moy&s;tned eyes, in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leaguer that came to releeue the Towne in vaine. In his ab&s;ence commaunded Baron <HI>Delede,</HI> a braue Commaunder, who carried him&s;elfe valiantly all the Siege, as the effect &s;hall proue: He had about two thou&s;and fiue hundred Souldiers in Garri&s;on, and three thou&s;and Burgers that were able to beare Armes, as they did; he wanted nei|ther victualles nor Munition at the beginning, as being in the <HI>Magazin</HI> of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and therefore &s;pared not his &s;hotte, but thundered mo&s;t fearefully into our Quarters, to the lo&s;&s;e of many. The Fortifications of the Towne are not very &s;trong, having but a good Wall, with &s;ome Ravelins and Bulwarkes, and no Out-workes, but before the gates: till at the time of the Siege, that they made diver&s;e Horne-workes and Traver&s;es, which did traver&s;e our Workes mightily. Thus much in view of the Towne.</P>
<P>Our Liaguer on the <HI>Brabandi&s;h</HI> &s;ide of the Towne was devided into foure Quarters next the <HI>Ma&s;e</HI> Northwardes,
<PB N="4" REF="4">where our <HI>Hollandi&s;h</HI> Shipping lay, was Baron <HI>Brederode</HI> quartered on a Hill, with &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiments, for the Guard of our Bridge and Shippes. Within halfe a myle from him, on the South-we&s;t &s;ide of the Towne, was the Quarter of his Excellencie the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who had the &s;trength of his Armie with him. The <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotti&s;h, French,</HI> &s;ome <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Forces. At the beginning his Ex|cellencies Tents were pitched betweene the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Quarter, fa&s;t by the Regiment of the Guardes. But the Enemies Cannons poynting directly that way, and &s;hooting diver&s;e times through his Excellencies Pavilion; they were remooved North-We&s;tward from the Towne to an eminent hill, of a very fayre pro&s;pect; from whence his Excellencie might &s;ee over all the Townes, and all his Quarters round about, &s;itting (as it were) in the mid&s;t of his Armie on a high Throne.</P>
<P>At his Excellencies right hand was the Count of <HI>Solmes,</HI> his brother in-Lawes Regiment, then in order Colonell <HI>Harwoods, Ca&s;terwards,</HI> Colonell <HI>Herberts,</HI> Colonell <HI>Packen|hams,</HI> my Lord <HI>Veeres,</HI> and Generall <HI>Morgans</HI> Regiments, in a Halfe-Moone (as it were) envirouing the Towne. At his left hand was <HI>Chastillion, Haulterine, Mai&s;on, Neufue,</HI> and Duke <HI>de Candales</HI> Regiments; and next to them to|wards the Towne, Graue <HI>Morris</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Hanaws</HI> Regiments.</P>
<P>Betweene the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the Towne, lodged the Lords the States Generall, and becau&s;e it was in a dangerous place, the Bullets flying round about them, they made a kinde of Traver&s;e before their lodging, to keepe off the enemies &s;hot. Before the States lay the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Quarter, Collonell <HI>Brooke,</HI> Collonell <HI>Balfour,</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Buchbergh</HI> Re|giments. At the right hand, a little behinde them the Prin|ces Guardes. Tho&s;e Regiments were in the Princes Quar|ter.</P>
<P>In the third Quarter, South South-We&s;t from the Towne, commaunded Count <HI>Henry, Grave Erne&s;ts</HI> elde&s;t &s;onne, now
<PB N="5" REF="4">Governour of <HI>Free&s;land</HI> in his Fathers &s;teade, with &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiments.</P>
<P>The fourth Quarter Southwardly from the Towne vp|on a hill, was commaunded by Collonell <HI>Pin&s;en,</HI> vnder who&s;e Quarter was the <HI>Ma&s;e,</HI> and a bridge over it, where all our provi&s;ions comming from <HI>Luyck,</HI> landed, and from thence was convayed into our Leaguer, on the other &s;ide of the Towne and Water. Before <HI>Wyke,</HI> was at the begin|ning but one Quarter, in forme of a Campe, commaun|ded by Count <HI>Morris van Na&s;&s;aw;</HI> before our enemies the <HI>Marques de Sancte Croce,</HI> and <HI>Pappenheym</HI> arrived: but afterwards when Count <HI>William</HI> came to vs from about <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> he lodged there likewi&s;e in a peculiar Campe, to hinder our enemies from attempting to relieue the Towne that way.</P>
<P>The whole Leaguer was formed of Hutts of Strawe and &s;ome Tents, &s;o that I could not imagine how it was po&s;&s;ible that &s;o much Strawe &s;hould be found about one Towne, and gathered in &s;o few dayes; for wee came the tenth day of <HI>Iune</HI> before the Towne, and the Leaguer was formed and fitted at the fifteenth day of the &s;ame moneth, when wee beganne our approaches. After that the Hutts were &s;et vp very conveniently and orderly, wee beganne to fortifie our Campe, and entrench vs round about with three &s;everall entrenchments and walles, three ditches be|ing here and there a&s;&s;ured by Scon&s;es, Redoubts, Halfe-Moones, Batteries, to be &s;ure at our backes, in the meane while, wee had to deale with the Towne: as likewi&s;e eve|ry Quarter was enclo&s;ed by it &s;elfe with a &s;trong entrench|ment, with &s;everall meanes to goe in and out, guarded day and night for all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The circuit of the whole Leaguer on both &s;ides was a|bout twelue or thirteene <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> myles, for I wentround a|bout on Hor&s;ebacke an ea&s;ie pace to view the Workes in foure houres. As for our provi&s;ion, wee had never &s;carci|tie of victualles, being relieved by tho&s;e of <HI>Luyck, Tonge|ren,
<PB N="6" REF="5">Sittert,</HI> and others, that came daily into our Quarters, with all manner of provi&s;ion, Bread, Meate, Chickens, Fruits, Fowles, Butter, <HI>Limborg</HI>-Chee&s;es, and e&s;pecially, with roa&s;ting Pigges, that I could not &s;ufficiently admire the quantitie of them. Beere and Wine wee had enough, although &s;ometimes cheaper, &s;ometimes dearer, according to &s;everall occurrences. For the &s;afetie of our Quarters, wee had but little, for there was no place in his Excellen|cies Quarter, at lea&s;t which was not within a Cannon-&s;hot from the Towne-wall: &s;o that at the beginning, before our Traver&s;es and Walles were made towards the Towne, ma|ny Souldiers, men and women, were killed in their Hutts and Tents, e&s;pecially, in the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Pin&s;ens</HI> Quarters; the certaine number thereof, I dare not mention, becau&s;e it may &s;eeme incredible.</P>
<P>Thus haue I brought you to the fini&s;hing of our Quarters in gro&s;&s;e, for the perfect entrenchment of them was not fini&s;hed till three weekes after.</P>
<P>The fifteenth day of <HI>Iune,</HI> beganne his Excellencie to ap|proach towardes the Towne in his Quarter onely, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> on one &s;ide, and by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>High-Dutch</HI> on the other &s;ide: none of the <HI>Low-Dutch</HI> out of no Quarter making any Approaches during this whole Siege. The Batteries that were ray&s;ed were three. 1. in our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Approaches with three; 1. in the <HI>French</HI> Approaches with three; 1. with <HI>Pin&s;ens</HI> Quarter with three peices, although afterwards we in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Approaches had but two Batteries. It was Colonell <HI>Harwoods</HI> turne to beginne the Approaches in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Quarter, and was releeved by Collonell <HI>Packenham,</HI> my Lord <HI>&V;eere,</HI> Generall <HI>Mor|gan,</HI> and the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Regiments, &s;o that it came to every Collonells turne to commaund once in &s;eaven dayes in the Approaches.</P>
<P>At the beginning they beganne to digge couragiou&s;ly, and went well on, &s;o that it was almo&s;t as &s;afe to be in the
<PB N="7" REF="5">Approaches as in the Quarters, they in the Towne &s;paring not their Ordnance to play continually, and &s;eldome with|out &s;ome lo&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>His Excellencie was very forward to further the worke, being more encouraged, when few dayes after the great Convoy came from <HI>Nymeghen,</HI> and the braue bringing in twentie Shippes with Munition and Meale for the Army, and withall a good number of Commaunders, and Gentle|men, that accompanied my Lord <HI>Veere,</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Oxford,</HI> arriving in &s;afetie the two and twentie day of <HI>Iune.</HI></P>
<P>Since the eighteenth till the twentie-two of <HI>Iune,</HI> there was nothing done or wrought in the approaches towardes their Halfemoone by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and towardes the re&s;t of the Out-workes by the <HI>French.</HI> Tho&s;e in the Towne ma|king &s;ometime &s;hew to hinder vs with their Sallyes, but without great hurt.</P>
<P>The twentie-three of <HI>Iune,</HI> his Excellency &s;ent a Trumpet into the Towne, with a Packet of Letters, wherein was the Declaration of Count <HI>Henry Vanden Bergh,</HI> &s;igned vnder his owne hand: but the Governour would not receiue the Letters, and &s;ent them backe againe, with prote&s;tati|on to receiue no Letters, but from his Generali&s;&s;imo, the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>de Sancte Croce;</HI> yet the Trumpet acquainted &s;ome in the Towne with <HI>&V;anden Bergs</HI> intention, and per|ceived &s;o much by &s;ome Souldiers, that alreadie they be|ganne to be weary of their labours, being forced to be day and night at the Guard, and that in the Out-workes to|wardes night, being Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> eue, when the Guard was relieved, they in the Towne made a very curious Volley, of their great and &s;mall &s;hot, in honour of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> the Bapti&s;t, which gaue an Alarm in &s;ome Quarters that were not well skilled in the Almanacke.</P>
<P>The twenty-foure of <HI>Iune,</HI> after their Matins, they made a Sallie both vpon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> entring into our
<PB N="8" REF="6">Trenches, and killing &s;ome few men, but were expul&s;ed with lo&s;&s;e, and left one of their men pri&s;oner behinde them. Wee had not aboue foure men killed, and Colonell <HI>Packen|ham,</HI> who commaunded in the Trenches, was &s;hot in his face, whereon he did lye many weakes, but recovered by Gods mercy. That night wee wrought on in our workes; and they in the Towne came often vpon vs with a <HI>Sa Sa Donques,</HI> but had no minde to fall on. That night was a fire in the Quarter of the Guardes, but did no great harme.</P>
<P>The twentie-fifth of <HI>Iune</HI> was a Salley made by them in the Towne vpon the <HI>French,</HI> and one Lieutenant and one En&s;igne, and &s;ome <HI>French</HI> &s;laine, but they were beaten backe againe.</P>
<P>The twentie-&s;ixe of <HI>Iune,</HI> was a Sergeant killed in my Lord <HI>&V;eeres</HI> Quarter; they played very hard with their Canon out of the Towne: wee heard newes of our enemies comming to relieue the Towne.</P>
<P>The twentie-&s;eaventh of <HI>Iune,</HI> towards evening we heard three or foure Cannon-&s;hots given by the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>Sancte Croce,</HI> for a &s;ignall of his comming to the Towne, being three houres going from vs.</P>
<P>The twentie-eighth of <HI>Iune,</HI> came a Bullet from the Towne in my Lord <HI>Morgans</HI> Tent, and brake two of his Coffers, without other harme; that after-noone wee had a fal&s;e A|larum by occa&s;ion of a Drumme that was to enter into the Towne, but &s;oone di&s;covered: the Marque&s;&s;e beganne to &s;hoot that Evening about twentie-three Cannon-&s;hot for a &s;ignall, and came nearer to vs, thinking to affright our Ar|my with his great Cannons.</P>
<P>The twentie-ninth of <HI>Iune,</HI> the Marque&s;&s;e marched fa&s;t by our Leaguer, in the &s;ight of our Army, where our hor&s;e did skirmi&s;h with his men. That night began our Grand|round, which la&s;ted a great while: the next day the Mar|que&s;&s;e went vp and downe about our Campe, being doubt|full
<PB N="9" REF="6">which way to march; till at la&s;t, the fir&s;t of <HI>Iuly,</HI> he tur|red towardes <HI>Barbie Brederods</HI> Quarter, and formed his Leaguer clo&s;e on the Rivers &s;ide by a Cloy&s;ter, where he remained vntill the day of the taking of the Towne, attemp|ting nothing again&s;t our Campe all that while, although he had many fayre opportunities, but the pri&s;oners and runna|wayes told vs, that he could not finde lea&s;ure to thinke on vs, being &s;o much imployed in dicing: that night my Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI> fell vpon the Enemies Traver&s;e with great cou|rage and re&s;olution, and tooke it by maine force, but for want of &s;uccours was con&s;trained to retyre; yet our men falling on the &s;econd day, beate the Enemie out againe, and had maintained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if our workemen that &s;hould haue turned the worke vpon the Enemies, had not treche|rou&s;ly neglected their workes, and fallen vpon the dead bo|dies to &s;trippe them; for in deferring the worke, the Ene|mie came out of the Towne, and made our men retire: where wee lo&s;t Captaine <HI>Haughton,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Knowles,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Enwein,</HI> Voluntiers vnder my Lord <HI>Veeres</HI> Companie, Lieu|tenant <HI>Gardly,</HI> and &s;ome common Souldiers, and Sir <HI>Simon Harencou&s;te,</HI> with Captaine <HI>Rookwood</HI> were hurt, but e&s;caped by the Lords mercy.</P>
<P>The next morning, the &s;econd of <HI>Iuly,</HI> wee had our re|venge on the Enemie, for the Marque&s;&s;e intending to make a bridge over the <HI>Ma&s;e,</HI> &s;ent &s;ome three or foure hundred men in boates over the River, to gette ground and make a little Countre&s;carfe about the Water, to a&s;&s;ure his workes, but our <HI>French</HI> troopes that had the Guard, &s;eeing them landed, charged them vnder the commaund of that braue Marque&s;&s;e <HI>Des Tiax,</HI> Lieutenant Colonell to the Duke of <HI>Candaile,</HI> and gaue them the overthrow, killing aboue a hundred, and taking the re&s;t pri&s;oners. Notwith&s;tanding, the <HI>Cariols</HI> Cannons, about tenne or twelue peices, which favoured their de&s;cent, and played continually vp|on our men &s;ore. Wee lo&s;t the &s;aid Marque&s;&s;e in returning victoriou&s;ly from the Water by a Canon-&s;hot, as likewi&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="7">Captaine <HI>Fouillem,</HI> and <HI>Dufre&s;ne,</HI> who was hurt and dyed afterwards: the Enemies much commended the valour of our men, as wee perceived out of Letters that were &s;ur|pri&s;ed.</P>
<P>After dinner, the enemies Trumpet came to demaund his pri&s;oners, and his Excellencie had a <HI>Ga&s;coigne French</HI> with him, repre&s;enting to him his kindne&s;&s;e and mercy, that he had not put to the &s;word all the pri&s;oners, which the enemies certainely had done, if they had had &s;uch an advantage over vs, but the Trumpet an&s;wered, that his Excellencies curte&s;ie and mercifulne&s;&s;e was knowne by ex|perience of the former yeare, when the Shallopes were ta|ken at <HI>Bergen,</HI> and therefore they hoped for the &s;ame in time to come, with promi&s;e to &s;hew the like favour to our men, in the like ca&s;e of extremitie; whereupon his Excel|lencie an&s;wered, that he hoped, he &s;hould not haue neede of their curte&s;ie.</P>
<P>And the third of <HI>Iuly,</HI> beganne our worke-men to Sappe into the enemies Traver&s;es, and cut them in peices, and &s;o to make them vn&s;erviceable to them. The Marque&s;&s;e mar|ched that day with &s;ome of his Forces towards <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> to &s;ee whether he could get over the River that way, but our troopes marching on the other &s;ide of the Water, tooke care of all occurrences, e&s;pecially when having joyned the Lord <HI>Diden</HI> with fortie or fiftie Companies, they di&s;po|&s;ed the barge betweene <HI>Roremond</HI> and in our Leaguer, in &s;uch a manner, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Marque&s;&s;e to vnder|take the pa&s;&s;age any more.</P>
<P>The fourth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> was Sir <HI>Iames Leve&s;ton,</HI> Lieutenant Colonell to Sir <HI>David Balfores</HI> Regiment, hurt in the head, but recovered by the Lords mercy. The &s;ame day were &s;ome eighteene Charrets with provi&s;ion, intending to goe to the Enemies Leaguer, brought in by our Hor&s;e|men.</P>

<P>Lieutenant Generall of the Hor&s;e, vpon one of the enemies Hor&s;e-Quarters, and &s;urpri&s;ing them, killed a great many, among&s;t them a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captaine, and came with &s;ome boo|tie and pri&s;oners backe againe into our Leaguer.</P>
<P>The &s;caventh of <HI>Iuly</HI> was Colonell <HI>Harwood,</HI> as hee commaunded in the approaches, &s;hot through his Hatte. They thundered this day mo&s;t furiou&s;ly with their Canon, notwith&s;tanding the great-empe&s;t and &s;torme that was the whole day.</P>
<P>After dinner brought our Hor&s;emen in &s;ome twentie-fiue pri&s;oners, one <HI>Dro&s;&s;ard,</HI> and nine Charrets with provi&s;ion, which were &s;old as good bootie. One of our Granadoes fell this night vpon a hou&s;e in the Towne, with &s;uch an o|peration, that it threw backe againe into our Approaches, a great peece of yron and tymber, which cau&s;ed great ter|rour to the Burgers.</P>
<P>The eight of <HI>Iuly,</HI> were againe &s;ome Charrets loaden with Wine brought in by our Hor&s;emen.</P>
<P>The ninth and tenth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> was nothing done, but wee wrought hard in our Approaches.</P>
<P>The eleventh of <HI>Iuly,</HI> they in the Towne &s;prung a Mine in the <HI>French</HI> Approaches, but without great effect. That day came Duke <HI>de Candale,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Craven</HI> to our Army.</P>

<P>The &s;ame night, made the Garri&s;on a Salley vpon the <HI>French</HI>-Approaches, and beate them out of &s;ome of their workes, and lodged there.</P>
<P>The next day, being the &s;ixteenth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> was a mine &s;prung by the <HI>French,</HI> and an a&s;&s;ault given by them vpon the enemies workes, and taken by force, but lo&s;t againe in|&s;tantly: they in the Towne playing with their Cannon and Muskets from the Wall on all &s;ides, &s;o fiercely, that our men could not hold the Worke. That night tooke the <HI>Wallons</HI> the Workes againe which the <HI>French</HI> had lo&s;t, and turned the enemie quite out of them, but not without a great fight, where on both &s;ides many lo&s;t their liues.</P>
<P>The &s;eaventeenth and eighteenth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> was it very quiet, onely we continued our fapper.</P>
<P>The nineteenth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> in the morning the Marque&s;&s;e gaue vs an Alarum, his Hor&s;e comming neare to our en|trenchments, and gallopping vp and downe within a Mu&s;|ket-&s;hot of our Fort, being aboue two or three thou&s;and Hor&s;es; but all their exployt was to take two or three hun|dred of our Waggen-Hor&s;es that were feeding thereabout, and to ma&s;&s;acre ten or twelue of our poore Wagginers mo&s;t cruelly, cutting off their eares and no&s;es, in a mo&s;t vile and barbarous manner. But our Cannon from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fort, and his Excellencies Battery, made many of them flie in the ayre; as likewi&s;e our Hor&s;emen tooke many of them in their retraites, where the Captaine of his Excel|lencies Cura&s;&s;iers, being too farre engaged, was &s;laine. That day and night before, were about an hundred and twen|tie Hor&s;es brought in by our Hor&s;emen, and &s;old as good bootie.</P>
<P>There had beene an adverti&s;ement given by &s;ome of the Enemies Campe, to his Excellencie by a Letter, of their enterpri&s;e, but that Letter was delivered too late, even when they retreated, by the fault of one whom wee dare not name. The Marque&s;&s;e came that night with &s;ome For|ces,

<P>The twentie of <HI>Iuly,</HI> they did nothing.</P>
<P>The twentie one of <HI>Iuly,</HI> they made a Salley from out of the Towne vpon our <HI>Corps de Guarde,</HI> which we had vnder <HI>Pin&s;ens</HI> Quarter, but were forced to retyre by our Hor&s;es, and &s;ome killed and taken pri&s;oners. That afternoone was a great Skirmi&s;h in the <HI>French</HI> Approaches, where the Count of <HI>Hanaw</HI> after he had &s;prung a Mine, fell vpon the enemies workes, and beate them out; it was long di&s;pu|ted and la&s;ted aboue one houre, and our men making &s;hew to retire, that braue Count with his naked &s;word in his hand, droue his men on, and encouraged them by his ex|ample, till at la&s;t he got a &s;hot in his head, whereof hee dyed fewe houres after; a great lo&s;&s;e of a hopefull young couragious Lord, brought vp by his Excellencie from a childe, and much lamented by all the Army.</P>
<P>The night following, attempted the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>de Sancte Croce</HI> againe to bring &s;ome of his troopes over the water, as they did, and landed ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ue three hundred, but were &s;o entertained by <HI>Grave van Stirum,</HI> that the mo&s;t of them were &s;laine, and a hundred of them brought pri&s;oners into our Quarters, among&s;t them &s;ome <HI>Neopolitan</HI> Captaines and Officers.</P>
<P>The twentie-two of <HI>Iuly,</HI> &s;prang the <HI>French</HI> another Mine, and got two rods of ground of the enemie. After dinner, the enemie &s;prung a Mine in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Approaches, but without great harme. Whereupon Lieutenant Colonell <HI>Proud,</HI> who commaunded in the Approaches in Colonell <HI>Packenhams</HI> turne hearing the Alarum, and running to|wards the breach, was &s;hot in his head &s;tarke dead, being much lamented by his whole Regiment.</P>
<P>The twentie-three of <HI>Iuly,</HI> here happened a memorable thing, that two of our workemen which the day before had beene blowne vp in the Mine, and afterward covered with the earth, came forth out of the ground againe with|out
<PB N="14" REF="9">any hurt, after that they had laboured with hand and foote to get out of the ground the whole night before. This &s;ame day &s;prang they in the Towne another Mine without hurt; for there was &s;carce a day that they did not trouble vs with Sallyes or Mines, behaving them&s;elues very valiantly and &s;toutly.</P>
<P>The next day being the twentie-fourth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> wee did &s;pring a Mine, with an indifferent good effect: the ground being made fa&s;ter and fitter for our Sappers.</P>
<P>The twentie-fiue of <HI>Iuly,</HI> was a Salley made by the Towne&s;|men vpon Count <HI>Morits</HI> Quarter, but they were repul&s;ed with lo&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The twentie-&s;ixt of <HI>Iuly,</HI> was a great Alarum in our Lea|guer, as if the Marque&s;&s;e would come to a&s;&s;ault vs in our Trenches; our Hor&s;e Sentinell having di&s;covered &s;ome of the Enemies Hor&s;es; and heard the beating of many Drummes towards our Leaguer; but it was a meere bra|vado, perhappes to take more Hor&s;es; not with an inten|tion to mea&s;ure the breadth of our ditches, and the firme|ne&s;&s;e of our entrenchments, whereunto our enemies had but little minde; knowing that for all their paines, they &s;hould get nothing but &s;hame and blowes. They in the Towne blew vp a Mine againe, but without effect.</P>
<P>The twentie-eight of <HI>Iuly,</HI> beganne the Marque&s;&s;e to play mo&s;t furiou&s;ly with his Cannons vpon our Guard which we had over the Water, charging his peices with Musket-bul|lets, but did no great harme. The <HI>French</HI> blew vp a Mine, and lo&s;t <HI>Lavioletta,</HI> a braue Captaine.</P>
<P>The twentie-ninth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> did our men approach towards the Halfe-moone before the gate, but were received with great and &s;mall &s;hot in abundance, and with Granadoes, which they threw thicke vpon vs: there was that hone&s;t Captaine <HI>Courtney</HI> hurt, whereof he dyed.

<P>The 30. began the <HI>French</HI> to come neere the Counter|&s;carpe in the Couertmynes they ca&s;t it, and &s;o went to the ditch.</P>
<P>The 31. was a bloody day, where the enemies burnt &s;ome of our blindes or couerts to hide our workemen, and skirmi&s;hing with our <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> that had the Guard kil|led a great many, among&s;t them Lieutenant <HI>Bruce,</HI> and hurt Captaine <HI>Levi&s;ton</HI> and Captaine <HI>Dowgla&s;&s;e,</HI> and o|thers, and demounted one of our Canons.</P>
<P>The 1. of Augu&s;t, burnt the enemy two of our blinds, and &s;lew &s;ome of our men in the gap; notwith&s;tanding we went on in our workes both Engli&s;h and French, for all the &s;tout oppo&s;ition of the enemy. The <HI>French</HI> about this time or a little before, beginning their Couert Galle|ry vnder the ground toward the wall which the enemy did not dreame of, but the Engli&s;h made a <HI>Corps de Gard</HI> fa&s;t by the Counter&s;carpe.</P>
<P>The 2. of Augu&s;t, fell a part of the Towne-wall to the ground, whereupon we did &s;hoot mo&s;t fiercely but it was not a &s;ufficient breach for an a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The 3. day, began the Engli&s;h their Gallery vnder the earth towards the Towne, and wrought very quietly, the enemy &s;hooting no more &s;o furiou&s;ly as they did for want of Powder as wee thought and afterward found to be true, yet was Colonell <HI>Harwood</HI> that night &s;hot in his legge with a Granado, as hee commanded in the Approa|ches and gaue order to re&s;i&s;t the enemies that came to pull downe our Musket baskets from our workes. That day went a Conuoy to <HI>Falckenburgh,</HI> a County and towne be|longing to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance got into the Towne, and tooke away as much proui&s;ion from thence as theyr Wagons could carry.</P>
<P>The 4. of Augu&s;t, began our Engli&s;h to cut through the Counter&s;carpe afore the Ditch and to looke into it, and found it very &s;teepe and deepe.</P>
<P>The next day, went his Excellency to <HI>Argentean,</HI> to conferre with the Magi&s;trate of <HI>Luyck</HI> that came thither.</P>

<P>The 6. wee went on in our workes, and &s;ome of our French Cauailiers went to &s;peake with &s;ome of theyr friends in the Enemies army, with leaue of his Excellency and found them di&s;pairing of all meanes to relieue the Towne, only they hoped to giue vs battell in our returne, which gaue a good couragement to our Souldiers.</P>
<P>The 7. fell the Scotti&s;h vpon the enemies Trauer&s;es and tooke it, with the lo&s;&s;e of a Captaine and tenne Soul|diers.</P>
<P>The 8. arriued <HI>Papenheym</HI> at <HI>Stitart,</HI> and came the 9.th before our Army.</P>
<P>The 10. was a Woman taken comming out of the Towne with an intent to goe to the enemies Campe, and being examined by Serieant Maior <HI>Gla&s;&s;er,</HI> after many threatnings and intreates, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had &s;wal|lowed downe a little bullet and in it a Letter, which after a purge &s;hee voyded and the letter was found; the letter being wrapped together and put in a little bullet and ba|ked in a pa&s;te that &s;he &s;hould the ea&s;ier &s;wallow it downe, the contents of the Letter are not knowne.</P>
<P>The 11. of Augu&s;t, being a day of Prayers in the Lea|guer and in all the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> was Colonell <HI>Har|wood</HI> &s;layne in the approaches with a &s;mall Canon bullet of 6. pound, and his heart beaten in peeces that hee dyed in&s;tantly as hee was viewing the Enemies workes and commaunding in the approaches in his turne; a braue Commander, and as hee was generally beloued of men of high and low e&s;tate, &s;o was he generally lamented for his Piety and experience in warlike affaires. The Prince be|wayling him as a valiant Colonell, the States as a faithfull Patriot, the Church as a true Pillar, the Nobility as a fur|therer of theyr aduancements, and the common Souldier as a Father and Benefactor; his Regiment was &s;oone af|ter prouided with a mo&s;t worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;our, that noble Knight Sir <HI>Henry Herbert,</HI> hitherto Lieutenant Colonell for the &s;ame Regiment. That euening came the Palatine Duke of <HI>Newburg</HI> to our Army, and was receiued of his
<PB N="17" REF="10">Excellency afore the Campe and curteou&s;ly entertayned, but had not his reque&s;ts granted to him, as being ab&s;urd and prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P>He went the next day and came againe into our Leaguer at the euening, his demands were as much as wee could perceiue, to make <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> &amp; <HI>Wyke</HI> newtrall townes and to bee a Mediator betweene his Excellency and <HI>Pap|penheym,</HI> who came to releeue <HI>Wyke</HI> as depending from the Roman Empire, and as hee began in &s;ome licentious &s;peeches in a manner to threaten the States with <HI>Papen|heyms</HI> forces and courage, hee receiued &s;uch an an&s;wer from his Excellency and the Lord Pre&s;ident, that he was faine to goe home the next day as he came, without effe|cting any thing.</P>
<P>The 12. of Augu&s;t, was a great fire in Colonell <HI>Har|woods</HI> Quarter, which burnt a whole diui&s;ion to the very skirt where the dead body of Colonell <HI>Harwood</HI> did lye and there it &s;tayed, the wind turning in a moment as I did ob&s;erue and many with me not without admiration.</P>
<P><HI>Papenheym</HI> came that day and Quartered behind Count <HI>Morwets</HI> quarter vpon an hill within le&s;&s;e then a Canon &s;hot but attempting nothing that day. Thus were wee inuironed on both &s;ides by our Enemies, hauing the Mar|quis on the one and <HI>Papenheym</HI> on the other &s;ide of the Riuer and the Towne afore vs. But hauing the Lord and a good cau&s;e on our part, there was none of the whole Ar|my that was the lea&s;t affrighted, for all the&s;e Spaniards and Imperiali&s;ts, but wi&s;hed rather that they might come and try what courage wee had in our Army, as they did few dayes after.</P>
<P>The 13. comming nearer and nearer the Towne wee found greater re&s;i&s;tance, the Towne&s;men &s;inking their Canons to &s;hoot into our workes, making new Batteries in the bottome of the Ditch, and v&s;ing all meanes to keep vs alwayes bu&s;ie. As likewi&s;e our enemies with fal&s;e a|larums awaking vs night and day, and keeping vs in a continuall guard with our whole Army many dayes, not
<PB N="18" REF="11">without great trouble and wearine&s;&s;e to our common &s;ouldiers and Officers, though they did it very cheereful|ly as hoping for a good &s;ucce&s;&s;efull end and i&s;&s;ue of theyr labours; then began <HI>Papenheym</HI> to &s;hew him&s;elfe an ene|my by his Actions, skirmi&s;hing with our men and hin|dering our victuals to come from <HI>Luyck</HI> to our Leaguer.</P>
<P>The 14. of Augu&s;t, were &s;ome &s;ouldiers and women, comming out of the Towne to cut Corne, taken Pri&s;o|ners, who made contrary reports, &s;ome thinking it vnpo&s;|&s;ible that we &s;hould take the Towne, others that the Towne could not holde out 7. dayes longer and the like, but the be&s;t aduice in what extremity the Towne was in, we had by another woman that was brought in that day with an intention to carry newes to the Marque&s;&s;e lea|guer, and being examined by the Serieant Maior Generall would confe&s;&s;e nothing, nay did laugh &amp; &s;eeme to wonder when he asked her, whether &s;hee had not eaten any let|ters, but at the la&s;t he &s;hewing her the Bullet of the other woman and making her beleeue that he had cut the other womans belly &amp; found the letter in it, vowing to do &s;o to her, if &s;he not would confe&s;&s;e the truth, the poore woman fell on her knees and demaunded pardon and grace, con|fe&s;&s;ing that &s;hee had &s;wallowed &s;uch a pill which &s;hee emptied after a purge, and two letters found in it, one in Spani&s;h from the baron of <HI>Lede</HI> Vice Governour of <HI>Ma|&s;triecht</HI> to <HI>La Mottery,</HI> that was in the Marque&s;&s;e Campe de&s;iring releefe, with promi&s;e to holde out; the o|ther from the Magi&s;trate to the &s;ame <HI>La Mottery,</HI> pro|te&s;ting that if they were not releeued within 3. dayes they would and mu&s;t yeeld to the enemy, &s;uch was the condition of the Towne that they did not agree, &s;ome de|&s;iring to treat, others to hold out, &s;ome labouring more for there honour, others for theyr profit.</P>
<P>The 15. of Augu&s;t, came <HI>Kutingen</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cullen</HI> to the States and his Excellency, but was &s;o coldly entertained and &s;o &s;leightly welcommed, that he could pre&s;ently gue&s;&s;e the nature of his di&s;patch

<P>The 17. of Augu&s;t, was the bloodie&s;t day we had all this &s;iege, for we had worke ynough on both &s;ides; They in the Towne &s;allyed forth vpon vs in the morning and comming vnawarres behinde our Sentinell, fell into our fir&s;t <HI>Corps de Garde</HI> afore they were di&s;coucred, and throwing aboue 20. hand Granadoes among&s;t our men, that lay here and there &s;ecattered, put them into &s;uch a confu&s;ion, that they quitted that worke and retired to the 2. <HI>Corps de Garde</HI> but were driuen from thence and out of the 3. likewi&s;e, theyr we lo&s;t many men afore our troopes could come in &s;ome order, by the meanes of Captaine <HI>Cromwell</HI> who gathered as many men as he could to hinder the enimies proceedings, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by that Noble Lord <HI>Crauen</HI> who came thither vpon this fir&s;t alarum to pre&s;ent his &s;ervice, as he was honorably im|ployed in commanding the Pikes; &s;o that the Enemy &s;ee|ing our men ready to come vpon them fell back by little and litle, till at la&s;t they werebeaten out of all our workes againe with lo&s;&s;e and &s;hame.

But as the Enimies were beaten out of the workes which they had gotten, &s;o we had another re|venge vpon our Enimies in the afternoone to keepe them off from our workes that they &s;hould not enter them, on the other &s;ide of the water: for <HI>Pappenheym</HI> &s;ending &s;ome of his Hor&s;e to draw out our Hor&s;es to a skirmi&s;h, and by that to draw them into an Ambu&s;cado which he had laid in a little Wood with 5. or 600. Musketiers, neare which &s;ome of our Musketiers that were &s;ent out by Count <HI>Me|rats</HI> to charge the Hor&s;es, not &s;uffering our hor&s;es to goe forth for feare of an Ambu&s;cado; whereupon his Mu&s;|kettiers i&s;&s;uing out of theyr Bu&s;hes charged our men, and cau&s;ed them to retire which they did in good order be|ing le&s;&s;e in number, and the <HI>Pappenheyms</HI> pur&s;uing ea|gerly after our men, came into a ditch that had beene made long agoe by our Hor&s;men to keepe in theyr Hor|&s;es, and thinking they were in our entrenchments, &s;ent for &s;peedy releefe to <HI>Papenheym</HI> with adui&s;e, that they had gotten into our workes, which they found a little way off, more important and of greater difficulty to force then they imagined, and therefore began to retyre, but the poore Footmen being kept and forced to goe on by their owne Hor&s;emen which came behind them with their &s;words to beate them forward, they &s;aw no other reme|dy but to runne headlong again&s;t our walles and there to dye before their enemies, rather than to bee &s;tayne by their owne hor&s;es. For it happened, that wee being pro|uided for them, gaue them &s;uch a welcome with our Ca|nons being placed on both &s;ides and charged with Mu&s;|ket bullets be&s;ides our Muskettiers from the walles, that they were &s;layne like &s;illy &s;heepe and fell in abundance, till our men being weary of killing fell out vpon them and tooke the re&s;t Pri&s;oners.

<PB N="21" REF="12">them theyr &s;torme-ladders, munition, Armes and other In&s;truments. There was a bill or a li&s;t brought to the Court of &s;layne: Foure Colonels, 7.

Wagons full of &s;layne and hurt, and left behinde them aboue 2. or 300. in the fields &s;tripped, which our &s;ouldiers buried the day after. Thus was <HI>Papenheym</HI> forced to confe&s;&s;e, that our workes were not to be forced for all his braueries, to &s;end vs backe againe with a &s;taffe in the hand, yet was hee &s;o much more to be comended then the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for his courage, that he dur&s;t attempt that when our workes were fini&s;hed, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> dur&s;t not doe with a &s;tronger Army afore our workes were brought to perfection.</P>
<P>The 18. arriued at <HI>Noufit,</HI> a Conuoy of 50.

<P>The 19. wrought our workemen in the Myne &s;o fa&s;t, that they got vnder the wall in hope to &s;pring it within few dayes as it was done.</P>
<P>The 20. were the two dead bodyes of Colonell <HI>Har|wood,</HI> and Count of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> carried out of the Leaguer in two Wagons, their Companies marching afore them be|fore our entrenchments, from whence they were brought to the Enemies leaguer and by the Marque&s;&s;e Trumpet conducted to <HI>Mazeyk,</HI> and &s;o by water into <HI>Holland.</HI> That day was the Eeue of our Ioy and Victory, but a &s;ad and heauie one, for our Mine which was appointed to be &s;prung about 5. a clocke, could not be ready till towards 9. a clocke which cau&s;ed a great confu&s;ion and trouble. To &s;peake larger of it, wee had made a deckt Gallery vn|der the ground towards the wall, and as our Ingenier
<PB N="22" REF="13">thought to be farre enough, hee began his Mine making three &s;euerall Chambers, and putting &s;ome 18. tonnes of Powder in them; but they in the Towne by theyr Coun|termines found out our myne and began to take it in 9. tonnes of Powder, which our Ingenier perceiuing ha&s;te|ned the other chambers, one of them taking fire about 9. of the clocke in the darke&s;t night, wee had in a &s;hort time made an indifferent breach in the wall, but not &s;o great as we had de&s;ired. Whereupon the Companies were com|manded and &s;ome others voluntarily to fall on, but found the ditch very &s;teepe and deepe, that the mo&s;t part of the Soldiers and Officers were forced to &s;it downe vpon the ground and &s;o to &s;lide downe in the ditch vpon their bree|ches, which being done, they found the other &s;ide of the ditch very high and &s;teepe againe to a&s;cend, the breach being aboue in the &s;tone wall, &s;o that with much adoe they did climbe vp to the breach; in the meane while they in the Towne knowing the place of the myne re|&s;orted all thither, Souldiers, Burgers, and Clergy-men, and threw abundance of hand Granadoes and pitched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">opes and the like &s;tuffe downe in the Ditch, and &s;hot &s;o fiercely with Canons and Muskets vpon our poore men, that they were forced to retyre with &s;ome lo&s;&s;e, Lieute|nant <HI>Hollis</HI> who commaunded the a&s;&s;ault was &s;hot in his thigh, and many Officers and Gentlemen killed and hurt. His Excellency was then in the approaches and could not &s;ufficiently commend the courage and re&s;olution of our <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that went on like as to a Fea&s;t with a great noi&s;e and acclamation.</P>
<P>The in&s;ucce&s;&s;iblene&s;&s;e of the breach and the darkne&s;&s;e of the night, was the cau&s;e that the Towne was not for|ced, which in the day time would ea&s;ier hane beene per|formed: And the Towne brought into that &s;ame e&s;tate in which they were fome 53. yeares agoe, when the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> tooke it by an a&s;&s;ault, and killed Men, Women and Children, and pillaged the whole Towne; For our Souldiers longed already for the faire Buffe coats,
<PB N="23" REF="13">and Gold&s;mithes &s;hops, which are renowned in this Towne to make good booty, but the Lord had otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to &s;pare &s;o much innocent blood that would haue bin &s;pilt in the &s;acking of &s;o mighty a Towne. They within the Towne had made within the walls &s;euerall Trauer&s;es, and cut off the wall, and planted Ordnance heere and there, that if we had gotten into the Towne we had found yet great re&s;i&s;tance, how&s;oeuer this bold at|tempt of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did &s;o terrifie both Clergie and Bur|gers, that the next day being the 21. of Augu&s;t about 8. a clocke, they began to con&s;ult in the towne, whether they &s;hould &s;tay for the &s;econd myne in the <HI>French</HI> approches, which was to be ready within 2. dayes or come to a parly, con&s;idering that the longer they deferred the treaty, the wor&s;e Conditions &s;hould they obtayne from his Excel|lency; Therefore Saturday the 21. of Augu&s;t, betimes a Clergy-man without warrant began to tole the great Bell which was not wont to be tolled but in great extre|mitieand danger, with an intent to a&s;&s;emble the people, which &s;trucke &s;uch a terrour in the Commons thinking there had beene another myne &s;prung, that they came to|gether de&s;iring to parley, and the Magi&s;trates and Clergy being as forwards as &s;ome of the Burgers, they forced the Gouernour to come to a Treaty how loath and vnwilling &s;oeuer hee was, repre&s;enting vnto him the great danger they were in, if the towne &s;hould be forced, the litle hope they had of reliefe, the great honour hee had gotten alrea|dy in giuing an a&s;&s;ault. And thus, till at la&s;t mingling threatnings with intreaties, they moued the Gouernour to put out the white Flag and to de&s;ire a parley, which was granted by his Excellency. And the Serjeant Maior Generall going into the Towne, there came &s;ome Cap|taines and Magi&s;trates vp to his Excellency and treated that whole day, til the next day after they agreed, on both &s;ides vpon &s;uch Conditions as you may finde in the prin|ted Articles, and the Conditions on the behalfe of the Garri&s;on, were fulfilled the day after being Munday the
<PB N="24" REF="14">23. day of Augu&s;t, where about Two of the clocke in the afternoone, they marched out with flying Colours, full Armour, lighted matches, in number about 1300. &s;trong &s;ound men, be&s;ides tho&s;e that were vpon Wagons with the bagage, and &s;uch as were hurt, they had but 2. Com|panies of Hor&s;es very weake, and tooke with them &s;ixe Pieces of Canon. That day marched into the Towne his Excellencies Guard, and the Colonels Companies, which were releeued by others &s;ome dayes after, till a certaine Garri&s;on &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Thus was that &s;trong (and in the eyes of the world) impregnable City of <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> and <HI>Wyck</HI> taken in by his Excellency, by the Lords e&s;peciall grace and ble&s;&s;ing, the difficulty of which Siege, was not &s;o much in regard of the &s;trong Fortification, as for the &s;cituation of it be|ing &s;o farre from <HI>Holland,</HI> in the midde&s;t of the enemies Countrey, the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> darling Towne which hee would not loo&s;e for any thing. Many things were very memorable in this Siege, of which, 4. I cannot chu&s;e but relate.</P>
<P N="1">1 That the things which is brought to hee very hin|der&s;ome and trouble&s;ome to vs, with a meanes of furthe|ring vs and doing vs good. 1. The weather. 2. The E|nemies, for it is generally knowne, how wet and moy&s;t a Summer we had this yeare, full of Raines, tempe&s;ts, &s;tormes, hales, and inundations, which &s;hould haue &s;ee|med to hinder vs exceedingly. There is none of the elde&s;t men in our Army that had remembered &s;uch a fea&s;on, &s;o that &s;ome times we could not &s;ee the Sunne &s;hine in ma|ny dayes, and were forced on the very Mid&s;ummer day to &s;it neare the fire to warme vs, as likewi&s;e often in the Dog dayes. But the &s;ame God who ruleth &s;ea&s;ons and wea|ther, and manife&s;ted his goodne&s;&s;e towards vs by that dry Summer, before the <HI>Bu&s;h</HI> when wee had need of it, in re|gard of the moy&s;tne&s;&s;e of that Mari&s;h ground about that City. He granted vnto vs a wet Summer in regard of the contrary di&s;po&s;ition of this ground about <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="14">being hard &s;tony and a very firme Clay ground, &s;o that if the Lord had not continually &s;oftened the earth by abun|dance of rayne, it had bin impo&s;&s;ible for our workmen to worke at all, or at lea&s;t &s;o currantly in the approaches and trenches; &s;o that though it was very tedious to tho&s;e that had the Guard in the approaches to &s;tand in the durt o|uer the &s;hooes, yet in regard of the publike good it was very profitable to haue rayne and wet weather; be&s;ides, the &s;ame rayne and abnndance of wet weather did &s;erue vs likewi&s;e, in regard of the Riuer of <HI>Ma&s;e</HI> which was alwayes ouerflowne: for that our Army and (the Marquis could not pa&s;&s;e ouer with his Army, or at lea&s;t with his Hor&s;e to a&s;&s;ault vs on the other &s;ide) where wee were weaker at the beginning; for you mu&s;t know, that fir&s;t of all, we entrenched our &s;elues on this &s;ide of the Riuer where <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> lyeth, becau&s;e the reliefe for the towne &s;hould come out of <HI>Braband,</HI> &s;o that wee had need to be &s;ure on our backe for our Enemy, which was done with|in a &s;hort time, and after that wee did goe to worke on the other &s;ide in Graue-<HI>Morrit,</HI> Quarter to entrench that likewi&s;e. And our enimies comming before our trenches on this &s;ide, when they were almo&s;t ready, &s;eeing the diffi|culty to force vs, labored by all meanes to get ouer the ri|uer to bring &s;ome releife in the Towne through Graue <HI>Morrits</HI> Quarter which was not fortified; But the Lord who alwayes fought for vs and made all his Creatures to &s;erue vs, kept the Riuer of <HI>Ma&s;e</HI> in an extraordinary height and the &s;treame in &s;uch a manner of violence, that wheras heretofore it was the whole Summer quayable &amp; ea&s;y to pa&s;&s;e on Hor&s;e-back, this yeare it was a hard mat|ter to cro&s;&s;e it with a Boate, &s;o that our enimy was di&s;ap|pointed in his di&s;&s;ignes. But marke the vn&s;peakable wi&s;|dome and providence of our God, no &s;ooner were wee come with our approaches almo&s;t to the end, and our workes round about the leaguer fini&s;hed and <HI>Pappenheym</HI> with his Army almo&s;t arriued on the other &s;ide out of <HI>Germany,</HI> but faire weather commeth on, and the ground
<PB N="26" REF="15">growne hard agayne and difficult for <HI>Pappenheym</HI> to worke in his batteries and entrenchments. Then the Riuer grew le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e and <HI>Pappenheym</HI> ioyned with the Marqueffe by a Bridge which hitherto we had hin|dred him to doe a long. Wee &s;tood in need of it and did not care, for hauing made an end of our workes. And as the weather, &s;o our enimies them&s;elues haue fought for vs and done as it were a good turne, to deferre to a&s;|&s;ault vs till our workes were ended, and to lye hereabout as without attempting any thing again&s;t &s;ome of our Townes in the vnited Provinces, for if the Marque&s;&s;e had fallen on at his fir&s;t comming, when he was &s;trong in men and had aboundance of ordnance with him, theyr had beene a po&s;&s;ibility to doe vs &s;ome hurt and to bring vs to &s;ome inconueniency, if not to relieue the Towne, our workes being yet vnperfect, but by putting it off from one day to another, wee made our &s;elues &s;o fa&s;t, that afterwards if hee had any mind to a&s;&s;ault vs it had beene vnprofitable, nay preiudiciall to his whole Army, or if hee had gone into <HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>Frizeland,</HI> and taken the cour&s;e which Graue <HI>Henry vanden Bergh</HI> tooke in the Siege of the <HI>Bu&s;h,</HI> to &s;poyle our Country within, and feare vs, hee might haue done vs great harme, if not taken fome towne or forced vs to deuide our Army; but the Lord hath &s;o blinded theyr eyes and benummed theyr wi&s;e Councell, that they would rather &s;it downe neare vs, dye for hun|ger, and loo&s;e a great &s;ort of men that runne ouer to vs e|uery day, to bee as it were eye-witne&s;&s;es of our good &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e and victories, then by any honourable attempt annoy vs or profit them&s;elues. It is the Lords worke, and it is maruailous in our eyes.</P>
<P N="2">2 It is likewi&s;e worthy to be ob&s;erued how the Lord did ble&s;&s;e &s;o bold an enterprize with a &s;ucce&s;&s;efull I&s;&s;ue, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many lets &amp; hindrances. It is to won|der at, and a &s;trange thing to tho&s;e that know this Coun|try, that the States &s;hould &s;end theyr Army vnder the co~mand of his Excellence in &s;o farre and remote a Coun|try
<PB N="27" REF="15">from theyr owne territories, to be&s;iedge &s;o great, po|pulous, &s;trong, and well furni&s;hed a Town, being &s;cituated in the mid&s;t of the enimies Country, the Magazin of whole <HI>Brabam,</HI> the ordinary Rendeuous of the Kings Ar|mies, full of deuout Clergy, faithfull &s;ubiects to the King, valliant &s;ouldiers, hauing aboundance of all nece&s;&s;aries without any want what&s;oeuer, &amp; good re&s;olution, to hold out, and greater hope to be certainly releeued by an Army that came a farre way, without any baggage or &s;ufficient proui&s;ion, hauing left the mo&s;t part of the Canons, Mu|nitions, Proui&s;ions, Tents, Clothes, Linnen, on &s;hipboard at <HI>Nymmegen,</HI> without any po&s;&s;ibility to come to them, as indeed even the be&s;t of vs had want of &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries to the very end of the &s;iege. 3. Hauing no hope to get any proui&s;ion out of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and relying onely and mainely vpon a people neutrall. 4. Be&s;ieging that va&s;t Towne but on one &s;ide from his Excellencies owne quarter, by 2. aproches of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> where the enimie might bend his might and &s;trength to hinder and oppo&s;e vs, and notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;itions goe through with it, continue the &s;eidge &s;o long time 10. weekes and two dayes, and at la&s;t take it by Compo&s;ition. 5. In the &s;ight and pre&s;ence of two powerfull &s;trong Armies of the ene|mies, lying both within a Canon &s;hot from our leaguer, who&s;e onely de&s;ire was to keepe that darling City. It is the Lord who girded our loynes with &s;trength, with him hath our Army leaped ouer the wall, he hath fought our battels for vs, ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name.</P>
<P N="3">3 It is remarkable that this whole &s;eidge, notwith|&s;tanding that vn&s;ea&s;onable weather and many nece&s;&s;ities, and wants of diuers things, our Army hath not beere af|flicted with any &s;ickne&s;&s;es or di&s;ea&s;es, which othe wi&s;e accompanie &s;uch exploits. The Lord repairing and men|ding as it were the vn&s;ea&s;onablene&s;&s;e of the weather with a whole&s;ome piercing and delight&s;ome aire, which kept our bodies in good temper, and good con&s;titution; &s;o that I heare &s;carce of any of our &s;oldiers that was &s;icke of
<PB N="28" REF="16">any di&s;ea&s;e in all this &s;iege, ble&s;&s;ed bee the LORD of Ho&s;ts. For all the&s;e Con&s;iderations and many o|ther manife&s;tations of the Lords prouidence and good|ne&s;&s;e towards our Army, wee may confe&s;&s;e, that it was not the &s;trength of our Army or the Arme of fle&s;h by which wee haue gotten &s;o glorious a victory; but <HI>Digi|tus Dei,</HI> the power and Arme of Almighty God who hath the hearts of men in his hand, inclining them whether he will, that it is he alone who hath crowned this enterprize with glory and victory.
