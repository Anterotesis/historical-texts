<P>Although this winter weather (which proveth exceeding cold in the&s;e parts) &s;eemeth fitter for con&s;ultations than for a|ction, yet doe the Commanders of the Union goe on in their de&s;ignes and activitie, leaving for the Imperiali&s;ts (if they will take it) that part of con&s;ulting and providing what to doe a|gain&s;t the Spring. How&s;oever becau&s;e I have as yet no extra|ordinarie newes (be&s;ides the blocking up of Wolfenbuttle, and the marching of <HI>Bannier</HI> with his Army) of action for you at this time: I will &s;upply the want thereof by communicating to you the copie of a letter written by Generall <HI>Bannier,</HI> dated at Erford the 25. Decemb. la&s;t 1640. &s;aying thus:</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to under&s;tand, that on the 23. of November la&s;t I broke up with mine Armie from Pickenburg and am now here arrived: And having on the &s;econd of this moneth had a conference at Duder&s;tat with the French and Wymarian Com|manders, they thereupon took re&s;olution and order with their Forces to march on, and follow me. Concerning mine armie, I can &s;ay (and thank God for it) that the little re&s;t, which the &s;ame hath by my care enjoyed in tho&s;e quarters I provided for them in We&s;tphalia, Brun&s;wig and Luneburg, both my Caval|lerie and Infanterie hath much been mended &amp; re&s;tored, &s;o that I am come againe into the field with much &s;tronger and better Troops than I had before: while&s;t I am adverti&s;ed from divers places by pri&s;oners, that the enemies remaine &s;till in an ill con|dition, and are now di&s;per&s;ed into their quarters. Therefore I am re&s;olved nothing to neglect, but ob&s;erving and following my rea&s;on of war, to take &s;peedily my way towards tho&s;e parts, where by the power and help of God I hope to effect my de|&s;ignes: wherein, although I am not &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to de|&s;pi&s;e or neglect the enemy; yet neverthele&s;&s;e I am re&s;olved, in
<PB N="484" REF="9">ca&s;e he come forth to &s;top, or hinder my endevours and pro|gre&s;&s;e, upon any occa&s;ion that he &s;hall offer me, &s;till to be ready and in a good po&s;ture to give him battle, and to doe my utter|mo&s;t for the good Cau&s;e, wi&s;hing onely and praying heartily, that Almightie God by his hand doe &s;o conduct and pro&s;per the armes of her Maje&s;tie of Sweden, and all other Prote&s;tants, &amp; &s;o re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e of their enemies, that at length we may attaine the de&s;ired &s;cope, namely, a firme hone&s;t peace for all tho&s;e that &s;tand for the Go&s;pell. The Forces of Brun&s;wig, Luneburg and He&s;&s;en, are at this time in their quarters in We&s;tphalia, Free&s;|land, and other Dukedomes of their owne for particular de|&s;ignes, which neverthele&s;&s;e doe conduce us in generall. But I hope (according to their promi&s;es) in ca&s;e our enemies &s;hould againe &s;o encrea&s;e again&s;t the future Spring or Summer, that my army &s;hould grow inferiour to theirs, our &s;aid friends and allies will then againe be ready to joyne, and march with us to|gether, as nece&s;&s;itie &s;hall require: that wee may with a generall re&s;olution get a generall victory and honour together.</P>
<P>Thus much &s;aith <HI>Bannier,</HI> who &s;ince that time is arrived at Seitz, and gone from thence to Altenburg, and &s;o in Voitland, and the Wymarian Forces are two leagues from him, at New|&s;tat: Their march being &s;aid to goe directly to the upper Pala|tinate, and to vi&s;it the Dyet at Ratisbone.</P>

<P>With the la&s;t letters from Emden, wee have no other newes, but that the Prince Electour Palatine was yet there, from whence hee intended to goe to Gluck&s;tat, thinking that the King of Denmark was there, but un|der&s;tanding that the King was at Coldingen, he re&s;olved to goe the next day after with Count <HI>Volmar,</HI> the Kings naturall &s;on to Coldingen. We have in the&s;e parts &s;uch a fro&s;t, that almo&s;t all the rivers are frozen over, &s;o that

<P>It is confirmed from all places, that Generall <HI>Bannier</HI> with the mo&s;t part of his Army is arrived about Hoffe and Plan, wherefore &s;peedy order is given, that nine Ba|varian Regiments, and divers other Imperiall Regi|ments, which are neare&s;t at hand, &s;hall march with all &s;peed towards Erga, to &s;ecure that pa&s;&s;age, and to all o|ther Regiments that lye enquartered here abouts, in the Lower Palatinate, Wirtenberg, Franconia, Swaben, Mentz, and other parts, is likewi&s;e given &s;peedy order to draw together from all places, and make head again&s;t Generall <HI>Bannier;</HI> but &s;eeing the Imperiall Souldiers have been &s;o tired out and weakened, they have no great mind to it, and are verie unwilling to for&s;ake their quar|ters, e&s;pecially in this cold &amp; fro&s;ty weather, and doubt|le&s;&s;e many will run away before they come to the Ran|devouz; and albeit the Emperour &s;ees him&s;elfe now &s;o weakened, and withall the whole Empire &s;o wa&s;ted and ruinated, and in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate and condition, yet notwith&s;tanding wee heare not the lea&s;t motion of any peace; but mo&s;t men beleeve, that <HI>Bannier</HI> when he comes now into Bavaria, will per&s;wade them with &s;tron|ger arguments to change their minds.</P>

<HEAD>An Extract of a Letter from Norimberg, the <HI>1. 11.</HI> of Ianuarie.</HEAD>
<P>It is mo&s;t certaine, that Generall <HI>Bannier</HI> is pa&s;&s;ed with his whole Army by Hoffe and Plan, him&s;elfe in per&s;on hath beene in the &s;trong Fort and Ca&s;tle of Plei&s;|&s;enberg neare Culinbach, where hee left his Lady, and him&s;elfe followeth the Army, being above 30000 &s;trong: no que&s;tion but hee hath &s;ome great de&s;igne in hand, becau&s;e hee makes &s;uch ha&s;te in his march. The
<PB N="496" REF="15">King of Denmark having tryed all meanes, and &s;ent &s;un|dry letters to the Imperiall Dyet held at Ratisbone, to per&s;wade the Emperour, States and Peeres (if it were po&s;&s;ible) to conclude an univer&s;all peace thorowout the whole Empire, but having under&s;tood now, that the Prote&s;tant States and Peeres there could not prevaile with the Emperour and Prelates, that a con&s;tant peace might be concluded, hath &s;ent another to the Prote&s;tant States and Peeres, wherein he intimated unto them, that in ca&s;e the &s;aid Prelates would continue to &s;tand thus upon their owne heads, and not conclude a peace, they would force him to take another re&s;olution, and to joyn againe with his old Confederates, to try whether they joyntly could procure what hitherto hath been refu&s;ed: The Emperour and Prelates having heard of that letter, u&s;ed the Prote&s;tant States and Peeres more kindly than formerly, and wee hope that this will moderate matters &s;o, that we &s;hall againe heare of &s;ome propo&s;ition for a peace. At the conclu&s;ion of this letter wee receive cer|taine advi&s;e, that Generall <HI>Bannier</HI> hath divided his Ar|my into three parts, one part whereof he hath comman|ded towards Egra, which Citie is already &s;aid to bee ta|ken by the Swedes; another part hee hath commanded towards the upper Palatinate, &s;ome Troops whereof have beene a Gnadenberg, foure Germane miles from this Citie of Norimberg, where they pillaged a Cloy|&s;ter; the third part he hath commanded towards Fran|conia, to hinder the Imperiall Forces of their conjun|ction, which are &s;ummoned to draw together from all parts, though the fro&s;t be never &s;o great, and they never &s;o unwilling to march in this cold weather, and in &s;o un|&s;ea&s;onable a time, having hardly recovered them&s;elves a little &s;ince the la&s;t march, which had wearied and tired
<PB N="497" REF="15">them out &s;o much: It is certaine, that this unexpected and &s;peedy comming of Generall <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nier,</HI> cau&s;eth a great alteration and confu&s;ion among&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, that they doe &s;carce know what to doe.</P>
<P>With the la&s;t letters from France they write (but how certainly we know not) that the Pope hath put forth in print two Buls, in one whereof he confirmeth and e&s;ta|bli&s;heth the new crowned King of Portugall in his Throne and government: In the other hee threateneth all tho&s;e that &s;hall offer the &s;aid new King in his raigne and government, with excommunication. They write al&s;o from thence, that a great &s;tir and confu&s;ion is like|wi&s;e in Ca&s;tillia, and other Kingdomes of Spaine, which the Duke of Medina being borne of the Spani&s;h bloud layes claime to, pretending to have proper right to it, as if they would have no King more of the Germane, but onely of the Spani&s;h bloud. The Imperiall Generall, <HI>Iohn de Werth,</HI> who was detained pri&s;oner at Paris a great while, is now &s;ent from thence to Nancy, to be exchan|ged for Field Mar&s;hall <HI>Gu&s;tavus Horn,</HI> who comes from Ingol&s;tat. In holland are taken up for the French King &s;ome thou&s;and Souldiers, where or which way they &s;hall be employed, the next Spring wee &s;hall heare in time. The lo&s;&s;e which the French had in Catalonia is likewi&s;e confirmed from Paris, and that their Lieutenant Gene|rall was taken pri&s;oner, and &s;ent (after promi&s;e to beare no more armes again&s;t Spaine) to Bi&s;cay.</P>
