<P>THE Condition of an <HI>Author</HI> is much like that of a <HI>Strumpet,</HI> both expo&s;ing our <HI>Reputations</HI> to &s;up|ply our <HI>Nece&s;&s;ities,</HI> till at la&s;t we contract &s;uch an ill habit, thro our Practices, that we are equally troubl'd with an <HI>Itch</HI> to be always <HI>Doing;</HI> and if the Rea&s;on be requir'd Why we be|take our &s;elves to &s;o Scandalous a Profe&s;&s;ion as <HI>Whoring</HI> or <HI>Pamphleteering,</HI> the &s;ame Excu&s;ive An&s;wer will &s;erve us both, <HI>viz.</HI> That the unhappy circum&s;tances of a Narrow Fortune, hath forc'd us to do that for our Sub&s;i&s;tance, which we are much a&s;ham'd of.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t and mo&s;t commendable Talent, admir'd in either, is the knack of plea&s;ing; and He or She among&s;t us that hap|pily arives to a Perfection in that &s;ort of Witchcraft, may in a little time (to their great Honour) enjoy the Plea&s;ure of being Celebrated by all the <HI>Coxcombs</HI> in the Nation.</P>
<P>The only difference between us is, in this particular, where in the <HI>Jilt</HI> has the Advantage, we do our Bu&s;ine&s;s Fir&s;t, and &s;tand to the Courte&s;ie of our Benefactors to Reward us after; whil&s;t the other, for her &s;ecurity, makes her <HI>Rider</HI> pay for his <HI>Journey,</HI> before he mounts the <HI>Saddle.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A TRIP TO JAMAICA:</HEAD>
<P>_IN the times of <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> when <HI>Poverty</HI> was held no <HI>Shame,</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> no <HI>Vertue;</HI> When <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> in a Trade&s;man's Con|&s;cience, and <HI>Money</HI> in his Counting-Hou&s;e, were as &s;carce as <HI>Health</HI> in an Ho&s;pital, or <HI>Charity</HI> in a Clergy-man.

The one o'er Bottle breaks his Je&s;t,</L>

<L>For which he's Treated and Exalted,</L>
<L>By his dear Friend Sir <HI>Looby Dolthead.</HI></L>
<L>&V;nhappy Age! which &s;o in Vice &s;urpa&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>That Men of Worth mu&s;t Wor&s;hip <HI>Golden A&s;&s;es.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I being influenc'd by my Stars, with an unhappy propen&s;ity, to the Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e unlucky kind of <HI>Fortune-Hunters,</HI> till at la&s;t, tho' I had no more Wit to boa&s;t of than another Man, yet I &s;har'd the Fate of tho&s;e that had; and to bear them Com|pany, &s;tragled &s;o far from the Paths of <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Preferment,</HI> into a Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Plea&s;ure and <HI>Enjoyment,</HI> that I had like to have been &s;tuck fa&s;t in a Thicket of Brambles, before I knew where|abouts I was; to clear my &s;elf of which, I bu&s;tled like a <HI>Fox</HI> in a <HI>Gin,</HI> or a <HI>Hare</HI> in a <HI>Partridge-Net:</HI> But before I could free my &s;elf from this Entanglement, I had &s;o wounded my Feet, and &s;tuck &s;o many Thorns in my Side, that I halted homewards like a <HI>Gouty Puritan</HI> to an <HI>Election,</HI> or a <HI>Lame Beggar</HI> to a Mi&s;ers Funeral.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e little Afflictions mov'd me to reflect upon my Mis-&s;pent Time; and like a <HI>Thief</HI> in a <HI>Goal,</HI> or a <HI>Whore</HI> in a <HI>Flux,</HI> I Re&s;olv'd for the future to Reform my Life, change my Mea&s;ures, and pu&s;h my &s;elf upon &s;omething that might recover tho&s;e lo&s;t Moments, I had hitherto converted to the u&s;e of others, and not my &s;elf. I now began to peep into the <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of the World, and chang'd the Company of tho&s;e who had nothing to do but <HI>Spend Money,</HI> for the Conver&s;ation of &s;uch who&s;e Practice was to <HI>Get it.</HI></P>
<P>But I, thro' Inadvertency, neglecting to con&s;ult Doctor <HI>Trotter,</HI> or &s;ome other Infallible Predicting Wi&s;e-aker, began my Reformation in an unfortunate Minute, when <HI>&V;&s;urers</HI> were unbinding their <HI>Fetter'd Trunks,</HI> and breaking up their <HI>Deified Bags</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ecrated Sums,</HI> for the &s;ecurity of <HI>Religion,</HI> and the further e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> without which <HI>[Liberty]</HI> join'd, <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> to them would be of no u&s;e. <HI>Trade&s;men</HI> grumbling at the <HI>Taxes, Merchants</HI> at their <HI>Lo&s;&s;es,</HI> mo&s;t Men complaining for want of <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and all Men in <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> for want of <HI>Money:</HI> Every Man upon <HI>Change</HI> look|ing with as peevi&s;h a Countenance, as if he had unluckily &s;tumbled upon his <HI>Wife's Failings,</HI> and unhappily become a witne&s;s to his own <HI>Cuckoldome.</HI> The&s;e I thought but &s;lender Encouragements to a <HI>New Reformi&s;t,</HI> who had for&s;aken <HI>Liberty</HI> for <HI>Re&s;traint, Ea&s;e</HI> for <HI>Trouble, Lazine&s;s</HI> for <HI>Indu&s;try, Wine</HI> for <HI>Coffee,</HI> and the <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> of <HI>Witty Con|ver&s;ation,</HI> for the <HI>Plague,</HI> of a <HI>Muddy-Brain'd Society,</HI> who could talk of
<PB N="7" REF="4">nothing but <HI>Prime Co&s;t</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> the <HI>Good Humour</HI> of their <HI>Wives,</HI> the <HI>Wittine&s;s</HI> of their <HI>Children,</HI> and the <HI>&V;nluckine&s;s</HI> of their <HI>Prentices;</HI> and knew no more how <HI>Hand&s;omely</HI> to Spend their Money, than <HI>Hone&s;tly</HI> to Get it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Complaints</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Philodenarians,</HI> the <HI>Declination</HI> of <HI>Trade,</HI> and the <HI>Scarcity of Money,</HI> gave me no more hopes of mending my Condition, by pur&s;uing my intended mea&s;ures, than a <HI>Good Husband</HI> has of mending a <HI>Bad Wife</HI> by winking at her <HI>Vices.</HI> I now found my &s;elf in great danger of a Relap&s;e, to prevent which, after two or three Gallons of <HI>Darby-Ale</HI> had one day &s;ent my <HI>Wits a Wooll-ga|thering,</HI> and generated as many <HI>Maggots</HI> in my <HI>Brains,</HI> as there are <HI>Crotchets</HI> in the <HI>Head</HI> of a <HI>Mu&s;ician,</HI> or <HI>Fools</HI> in the <HI>Million Lotttry,</HI> I e'en took up a Re&s;olution to Travel, and Court the Blinking Gip&s;y <HI>Fortune</HI> in another Country. I then began to Con&s;ider what Cli|mate might be&s;t &s;uit with my <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> and what part of the World with my <HI>Circum&s;tances;</HI> and upon mature Deliberation, found a <HI>Warm Latitude</HI> would be&s;t agree with <HI>Thin Apparel,</HI> and a <HI>Money'd Country</HI> with a <HI>Narrow Fortune;</HI> and having often heard &s;uch extravagant Encomiums of that Ble&s;&s;ed Paradi&s;e <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where <HI>Gold</HI> is more plentiful than <HI>Ice, Silver</HI> than <HI>Snow, Pearl</HI> than <HI>Hail&s;tones,</HI> I at la&s;t determin'd to make a trial of my Stars in that <HI>I&s;land,</HI> and &s;ee whether they had the &s;ame Unlucky Influence upon me there, as they had, hitherto, in the Land of my Nativity.</P>
<P>In order to proceed on my <HI>Voyage,</HI> I took a Pa&s;&s;age in the good Ship the <HI>Andalucia;</HI> and about the latter end of <HI>January,</HI> 1697. Upon the di&s;&s;olution of the hard Fro&s;t, I pa&s;&s;ed, with many others, by the Night Tide, in a <HI>Wherry</HI> to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where our <HI>Floating Re|ceptacle</HI> lay ready to take in <HI>Goods</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;engers;</HI> but our Lady <HI>Thames</HI> being put into a Pa&s;&s;ion, by the rude Ki&s;&s;es of an <HI>Ea&s;terly Wind,</HI> drew her Smooth Face into &s;o many Wrinckles, that her ill|favour'd A&s;pect and Murmurings, were to me as Terrible as the Noi&s;e of <HI>Thieves</HI> to a <HI>Mi&s;er,</HI> or <HI>Bayliffs</HI> to a <HI>Bankrupt:</HI> and being pent up with my Limbs, in an awkward Po&s;ture, lying Heads and Tails, like <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Calves in a <HI>Rumford</HI> Waggon, I was forc'd to endure the In&s;olence of every Wave, till I was become as Wet as a New Pump'd <HI>Kidnapper.</HI></P>
<P>In this Condition I Embark'd about Two a Clock in the Mor|ning, where the chief Mate, as Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, condu|cted me to a wellcome Collation of <HI>Chee&s;e</HI> and <HI>Bisket,</HI> and pre&s;en|ted me with a Magnificent <HI>Can</HI> of Soveraign <HI>Flip,</HI> prepar'd with as much Art as an <HI>Apothecary</HI> can well &s;hew in the mixing of a <HI>Cordial.</HI> After this refre&s;hment, I betook my &s;elf to a <HI>Cabin,</HI> which fitted me &s;o well, it &s;at as tite as a <HI>Jacket</HI> to a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> where I Slept till Morning, as clo&s;e as a <HI>Snail</HI> in a <HI>Shell,</HI> or a <HI>Maggot</HI> in an
<PB N="8" REF="5"><HI>Apple-Kernel.</HI> Then Ri&s;ing, and after I had &s;urvey'd our Wooden Territories, I began to Contemplate upon things worthy of a &s;eri|ous Con&s;ideration, which &s;tir'd up in me that Malignant Spirit of <HI>Poetry,</HI> with which I am oft times unhappily po&s;&s;e&s;s'd: And what my <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> dictated to me, her <HI>Amanuen&s;is,</HI> I here, pre&s;ent unto the <HI>Reader.</HI></P>

<P>Towards the Evening the Captain came on Board, with the re&s;t of our Fellow-Travellers, who, when we were altogether patch'd up as pretty a Society, as a Man under my Circum&s;tances would de&s;ire to tumble into: There was Three of the <HI>Trouble&s;ome Sex,</HI> as &s;ome call them, (tho' I never thought 'em &s;o) who&s;e Cur|teous Affabillity, and Complai&s;ance of Temper, admitted of no other Emulation, but to &s;trive who (within the bounds of Mode|&s;ty) &s;hould be mo&s;t Obliging. One <HI>&V;nfortunate Lady</HI> was in pur|&s;ute of a <HI>Stray'd, Husband,</HI> who in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> had Feloniou&s;ly taken to Wife (for the &s;ake of a Plantation) a <HI>Lacker-Fac'd Creolean,</HI> to
<PB N="10" REF="6">the great di&s;&s;atisfaction of his Original Spou&s;e, who had often de|clar'd (thro' the Sweetne&s;s of her Di&s;po&s;ition) That if he had Marri'd another Hand&s;omer than her &s;elf, it would never hav'd vex'd her; but to be Rival'd by a <HI>Gip&s;y,</HI> a Tawny Fac'd <HI>Moletto</HI> Strumpet, a Pump|kin colour'd Whore, no, her Honour would not &s;uffer her to bear with patience &s;o coroding an Indignity. The other Two were a pretty <HI>Maid,</HI> and a Comely <HI>Widow;</HI> &s;o that in the&s;e three, we had every Honourable State of the whole Sex: One in the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Innocency,</HI> another of <HI>Frution,</HI> the third of <HI>Deprivation;</HI> and if we'd had but one in the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Corruption,</HI> a Man might have pleas'd him&s;elf as well in our <HI>Little World,</HI> as you <HI>Libertines</HI> can do in the <HI>Great One.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall be too tedious if I at large Particularize the whole Com|pany, I &s;hall therefore <HI>Hu&s;tle</HI> them together, as a <HI>Moorfields Sweetner</HI> does <HI>Luck in a Bag,</HI> and then you may Wink and Choo&s;e, for the Devil a Barrel the better Herring amongs us. We had one (as I told you before) <HI>Cherubimical La&s;s,</HI> who, I fear, had <HI>Lo&s;t her Self,</HI> two more of the &s;ame <HI>Gender,</HI> who had lo&s;t their Husbands; two <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> who had lo&s;t their <HI>Livings;</HI> three <HI>Broken Trade&s;men,</HI> who had lo&s;t their <HI>Credit;</HI> and &s;everal, like me, that had lo&s;t their <HI>Wits;</HI> a <HI>Craeoland Captain,</HI> a <HI>Superanuated Mariner,</HI> an <HI>Independant Merchant,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h Kidnapper,</HI> and a <HI>Monmothean Sythe-man,</HI> all going with one De|&s;ign, to patch up their <HI>Decay'd Fortunes.</HI></P>
<P>Every thing being in order for <HI>Sailing,</HI> the <HI>Pilot</HI> came on <HI>Board</HI> who put on &s;uch a Commanding Countenance, that he look'd as Stern as a <HI>Sarazins Head;</HI> and the <HI>Sins</HI> of his <HI>Youth</HI> having crept into his <HI>Pede&s;tals,</HI> he Limp'd about the <HI>Quater-Deck,</HI> like a <HI>Cripple</HI> in <HI>Forma Pauperis</HI> upon a <HI>Mountebanks Stage,</HI> making as great a Noi&s;e in his <HI>Tarpaulin Cant,</HI> as a <HI>Young Councel</HI> in a <HI>Bad Cau&s;e,</HI> or a <HI>Butcher</HI> at a <HI>Bear-Garden.</HI> As &s;oon as we had weigh'd <HI>Anchor,</HI> under the dole|ful Cry and hard Service of <HI>Haul Cat haul,</HI> there was nothing heard till we reach'd the <HI>Downs,</HI> but <HI>About Ship my Lads, bring your Fore Tack on Board, haul Fore-Sail haul, Brace about the Main Yard,</HI> and the Devil to do, That I was more Amaz'd than a <HI>Mou&s;e</HI> at a <HI>Thro&s;ters Mill,</HI> or the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> at a <HI>Clap</HI> of <HI>Thunder.</HI></P>
<P>By the help of <HI>Providence,</HI> the <HI>Pilot's</HI> Care, and <HI>Seamens</HI> Indu&s;try, we pa&s;s'd &s;afe to <HI>Deal,</HI> where we Anchor'd three or four Days for a fair Wind. In which interim, the <HI>Prince</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> had puff'd up an unwelcome Bla&s;t in the Night, which forc'd a Ve&s;&s;el upon the <HI>Goodwin.</HI> The next Morning the <HI>Salvages</HI> Man'd out a Fleet of their <HI>Deal Skimming-Di&s;hes,</HI> and made &s;uch unmerciful work with the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;'d <HI>Bark,</HI> that a <HI>Gang</HI> of <HI>Bayliffs</HI> with an <HI>Excecution,</HI> or a <HI>Kennel</HI> of <HI>Hounds</HI> upon a <HI>Dead Hor&s;e,</HI> could not have appear'd more <HI>Ravenous.</HI> From thence with a pro&s;perous Gale, we made the be&s;t of our way into the wide <HI>Ocean,</HI> which <HI>Marriners</HI> &s;ay, is of &s;uch Profundity,
<PB N="11" REF="6">that, like a <HI>Mi&s;ers Con&s;cience,</HI> or a <HI>Womans Concupi&s;cence</HI> 'tis never to be Fathom'd.</P>
<P>'Twas in the mid&s;t of Winter, and very Cold Weather, when we &s;et out; but in a Fortnights time we were got into a comfortable Climat, which yielded us &s;o plea&s;ant a warmth, that a Man might pluck off his Shirt upon Deck, and commit <HI>Murthor</HI> upon his own <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> till he was weary, without the danger of an Ague.</P>
<P>I happen'd one Morning to hear two <HI>Tar-Jackets</HI> in a very high Di&s;pute; I went to them, and ask'd the rea&s;on of their Difference. <HI>Why Sir,</HI> &s;ays one, <HI>I'll tell you, there was my Ma&s;ter</HI> Whi&s;tlebooby, <HI>an old</HI> Boat&s;wain <HI>in one of his</HI> Maje&s;ties <HI>Ships, who was</HI> Superhanded, <HI>and pa&s;t his Labour and the</HI> Ambaralitie Divorc'd <HI>him from his Ship, and the</HI> King <HI>allow'd him a</HI> Su&s;pen&s;ion, <HI>and this Lubberly Whelp here &s;ays I talk like a Fool; and &s;ure I have not u&s;ed the Sea this Thirty Years, but I can</HI> Argufie <HI>any thing as proper as he can.</HI></P>
<P>The chief <HI>Sports</HI> we had on Board, to pa&s;s away the tedious Hours, were <HI>Hob, Spie the Market, Shove the Slipper, Dilly Dally,</HI> and <HI>Back-Gam|mon;</HI> the Latter of which prov'd as &s;erviceable to me, as a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Heraldy</HI> to a <HI>Gentleman Mumper,</HI> or a <HI>Pa&s;s</HI> to a <HI>Pennile&s;s Vagabond:</HI> For (like the <HI>Whore</HI> who boa&s;ted of her <HI>Indu&s;try</HI>) I us'd to make my Days Labour worth <HI>Two Shillings, or Half a Crown,</HI> at <HI>Two Pence,</HI> or a <HI>Groat</HI> a <HI>Bout.</HI> The mo&s;t powerful Adver&s;ary I engag'd with, was a <HI>Par&s;on,</HI> who, when the Bell Rung to Prayers, would &s;tart up in the middle of a Hit, de&s;ire my Patience whil&s;t he &s;tep'd into the <HI>Great Cabin,</HI> and gave his Sinful Congregation a <HI>Dram</HI> of Evangelical <HI>Comfort,</HI> and he would wait upon me pre&s;ently. But that <HI>Recreation</HI> in which we took a more peculiar delight, was the Harmony we made by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the two <HI>Heaven-drivers,</HI> in Lyricking over &s;ome <HI>Antiquated Sonnets,</HI> and for varieties &s;ake, now and then a <HI>P&s;alme,</HI> which our Canonical <HI>Vice-Whippers</HI> Sung with as Penitential a grace, as a Sorowful Offen|der in his <HI>La&s;t Night-Cap.</HI></P>
<P>To plea&s;e my &s;elf at a Spare-Hour, I had taken with me a <HI>Flute,</HI> and there being on Board a <HI>Spanniel Dog,</HI> who <HI>(Seaman-like)</HI> had no great kindne&s;s for <HI>Wind-Mu&s;ick,</HI> for when ever he heard me <HI>Tooting,</HI> he'd be <HI>Howling,</HI> which, together made a Noi&s;e &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, that it frighted away a <HI>Quotidean Ague,</HI> from a Young Fellow who had been three Weeks under the hands of our Doctor.</P>
<P>One Night after we had well Moi&s;ten'd our Drouthy Carca&s;&s;es with an Exhilerating Do&s;e of Right Honourable <HI>Punch,</HI> there aro&s;e a <HI>Storm,</HI> for which I had often wi&s;h'd, that I might not be a &s;tranger to any Surpri&s;ing Accident the Angry Elements, when at Variance, might afford me. The Heavens all round us (in as little time as a <HI>Girle</HI> might loo&s;e her <HI>Maidenhead</HI>) had put on &s;uch a Malignant A&s;pect,
<PB N="12" REF="7">as if it threaten'd our De&s;truction; And <HI>Aeolus</HI> gave &s;uch unmer|ciful Puffs, and Whiffs, that I was fearful to &s;tand upon the <HI>Quarter Deck,</HI> le&s;t, before my time, I &s;hould be &s;natch'd up to Heaven in a Whirle-Wind. From all the Corners of the Skie there darted forth &s;uch Beams of <HI>Lightning,</HI> that I Vow and Prote&s;t the <HI>Fire-works</HI> in St. <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>Square,</HI> were no more to be compar'd to't, than a <HI>Gloworms Ar&s;e</HI> to a <HI>Cotten Candle,</HI> which were In&s;tantly &s;ucceeded with &s;uch Vollys of <HI>Thunder,</HI> from every &s;ide, that you would have thought the <HI>Clouds</HI> had been fortified with <HI>Whole Cannon,</HI> and weary of being to&s;t about with every Wind, were Fighting their way into a Calmer Region, to enjoy their Re&s;t, Then fell &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive <HI>Rain,</HI> that as we had one Sea under us, we fear'd another had been tumbling upon our Heads; for my part, I fear'd the very <HI>Falling</HI> of the <HI>Skie,</HI> and thought of no|thing but <HI>Catching</HI> of <HI>Larks.</HI> My Spirits being a little depre&s;t, by the apprehen&s;ions of the Danger we were under, I went down into the <HI>Gun-room,</HI> to con&s;ult my <HI>Brandy-Cask</HI> about taking of a <HI>Dram;</HI> where one of our <HI>Ladies,</HI> thro' want of better Accomodation, was forc'd to be Content with a <HI>Cradle,</HI> in which &s;he was <HI>Praying,</HI> with as much Since|rity, for <HI>Fair Weather,</HI> as a <HI>Farmer</HI> for a <HI>Kind Harve&s;t,</HI> or an <HI>Old Maid</HI> for a <HI>Good Husband:</HI> And I being greatly pleas'd at her mo&s;t Impor|tunate Solicitations, have given you a Repetition of one part, <HI>viz.

<P>In a doubtful Condition, between this World and the next, we labour'd till near Morning, about which time the Storm abated; But as &s;oon as Day-light appear'd and the &s;erenity of the Weather had turn'd our Frightful Apprehen&s;ions into a little Alacrity, &s;ome of the Men, from <HI>Aloft,</HI> Spi'd a Sail bearing after us with all Expedition; and being no great di&s;tance from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sally,</HI> a jealou&s;ie aro&s;e a|mong&s;t our Officers, of her being a Man of War belonging to that Country, they having upon the Conclu&s;ion of the late Peace with <HI>France,</HI> Proclaim'd a War with <HI>England;</HI> &s;o that we thought our &s;elves now in as great danger of being knock'd on the Head, or made Slaves, as we were before of being Drown'd. This Alaram kindled up among&s;t us new fears of approaching Danger, more Terrible than the former we had &s;o happily &s;urviv'd.</P>
<P>Command was given by our Captain, to prepare for a Fight; down Che&s;ts, up Hammocks, bring the &s;mall Arms upon the Quarter,
<PB N="13" REF="7" MS="y">an every Man directed to his Po&s;t, by orders fix'd upon the <HI>Mizzen-ma&s;t</HI> in the <HI>Steerage;</HI> the <HI>Bulkhead</HI> and <HI>Cabins</HI> nock'd down, the <HI>Deck</HI> clear'd <HI>Fore</HI> and <HI>Aft,</HI> for every Man to have free acce&s;s to his Bu&s;ine&s;s. When all things were in readine&s;s to receive an Enemy, I took a walk on purpo&s;e to look about me, and was &s;o animated which the Seamens Activity and Indu&s;try, together with the &s;mell of Sweat, Match, and Gun-powder, that like 'Squire <HI>Witherington</HI> in <HI>Chevy Cha&s;e,</HI> I could have Fought upon my Stumps. By this time our &s;uppos'd Enemy was almo&s;t come up with us, under <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, but his keeping clo&s;e upon our <HI>Quarter,</HI> and not bearing off, gave us &s;till rea&s;ons to mi&s;tru&s;t him; but &s;eeing him a &s;mall Ship, and ours a Ve&s;&s;el of 400 Tuns, 28 Guns, and about 50 Men, we <HI>Furl</HI>'d our <HI>Main-Sail</HI> with all our Hands at once, as a &s;tratagem to &s;eem well Man'd; put our <HI>Top-Sailes</HI> aback, and lay by, to let 'em &s;ee we were <HI>no more Afraid than Hurt.</HI> We had on Board an <HI>Iri&s;h-man</HI> going over a Servant, who I &s;uppo&s;e was <HI>Kidnap'd;</HI> I ob&s;erv'd this Fellow, being quarter'd at a Gun, look'd as pale as a <HI>Pickpocket</HI> new taken: I ask'd him why he put on &s;uch a <HI>Cow|ardly</HI> look; and told him 'twas a &s;hame for a Man to &s;hew &s;o much Fear in his Coun|tenance. <HI>Indeed Sir</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I cannot halp et, I love the bate of a Drum, the Pop of a Pi|&s;tol, or the Bounch of a Mu&s;hket wall enough, but, by my Shoul, the Roaring of a Great Gun always make&s;h me &s;tart.</HI> I ask'd him who&s;e Servant he was. <HI>By my Fait,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I cannot tell; I wa&s;h upon Change looking for a good Ma&s;hter, and a brave Gentleman came to me and ask'd me who I wa&s;h; and I told him I wa&s;h myn nowm &s;helf, and he gave me &s;ome good Wine and good Ale, and brought me on Board, and I have not &s;heen him &s;inch.</HI> By this time our Adver&s;ary was come within hearing, and upon our Hailing of him, prov'd a little &s;hip bound to <HI>Guinea,</HI> which put an end to our Fears, and made us fly to the <HI>Punch-Bowle</HI> with as much Joy as the <HI>Mob</HI> to a <HI>Bonfire</HI> upon a State- <HI>Holyday.</HI></P>
<P>After we had chas'd away the remembrance of our pa&s;t Dangers, with a reviving draught of our Infallible Elixir, we began to be <HI>Merry</HI> as &s;o many <HI>Beggars</HI> (and indeed were before as <HI>Poor</HI>) beginning to turn that into Ridicule, which &s;o lately had chang'd our Jollitry into Fear and Sadne&s;s. When we had thus refre&s;h'd our Bodies, and &s;trengthen'd our Spirits, by pa&s;&s;ing round a Health to our Noble Selves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'twas thought high time by our Reverend Pa&s;tors, to return Thanks for our great Deli|verance from the hands of our Enemies, tho' we had none near us, which was accor|dingly perform'd with all the Solemnity a parcel of <HI>Merry Juvenal</HI> Wags could compo&s;e them&s;elves to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>By this time we were got into &s;o warm a Latitude, that (God be thanked) a <HI>Lou&s;e</HI> would not live in it: We now began to thin our Dre&s;s, and, had not Decency forbid it, could have gladly gone Naked, as our fir&s;t Parents. Ki&s;&s;ing here grew out of Fa&s;hion; there's no joyning of Lips, but your No&s;es would drop Sweat in your Mouths. The Sea, and other Elements, began now to entertain us with Curio&s;ities in Nature worth ob&s;erving, as <HI>Grampos, Sharks, Porpus, Flying-Fi&s;h, Albacores Bonetta's, Dolphin, Bottle-no&s;es, Turtle, Blubber, Stingrays, Sea-Adders,</HI> and the Devil and all of <HI>Mon|&s;ters</HI> without Names, and &s;ome without Shape. As for Birds, <HI>Noddys, Boobies, Shear|waters, Shags, Pitternells, Men of War, Tropick Birds, Pellicans,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;hall not under|take here to de&s;cribe the&s;e Creatures, becau&s;e &s;ome of them are &s;o Frightfully Ugly, that if any Friends Wife with Child &s;hould long for the Reading of my Book, it &s;hould chance to make her Mi&s;carry. But that which I thought mo&s;t worthy of Ob&s;ervation, were the <HI>Clouds,</HI> who&s;e various Forms, and beauteous Colours, were Inimitable by the Pencil of the greate&s;t Arti&s;t in the Univer&s;e, <HI>Cities, Palaces, Groves, Fields,</HI> and <HI>Gardens, Monuments, Ca&s;tles, Armies, Bulls, Bears,</HI> and <HI>Dragons,</HI> &amp;c. as if the Air above us had been Frozen into a <HI>Looking-Gla&s;s,</HI> and &s;hew'd us by Reflection, all the Rarities in Nature.</P>
<P>By this time we had gain'd the Tropick, and come into a Trade-Wind; the grea|te&s;t of our fears being now a <HI>Calm,</HI> which is fine weather to plea&s;e fearful Tempers; but it brings us more in danger of being <HI>Starv'd,</HI> than a <HI>Storm</HI> does of being <HI>Drown'd:</HI> Tho' it was our Fortune in a few Days after, to make the <HI>Leward-I&s;lands,</HI> and put us

The Belly is call'd <HI>Callipee,</HI> the Back <HI>Callipach;</HI> and is &s;erv'd up to the Table in its own Shell, in&s;tead of a Platter.

<P>Milk is &s;o plenty, you may buy it for Fifteen Pence a Quart; but Cream &s;o very &s;carce, that a Firkin of Butter, of their own making, would be &s;o co&s;tly a Jewel, that the Riche&s;t Man in the I&s;land would be unable to purcha&s;e it.

<P>Every thing is very Dear, and an Ingenious or an Hone&s;t Man may meet with this Encouragement, To &s;pend a Hundred Pounds before he &s;hall get a Penny. <HI>Madera-Wine</HI> and <HI>Bottle-Beer</HI> are Fifteen Pence the Bottle; na&s;ty <HI>Claret,</HI> half a Crown; <HI>Rhenni&s;h,</HI> Five Shillings; and their be&s;t <HI>Canary,</HI> Ten Bits, or Six and Three Pence. They have this Plea&s;ure in Drinking, That what they put into their Bellies, they may &s;oon &s;troak out of their Fingers-Ends; for in&s;tead of <HI>Exonerating</HI> they <HI>Fart,</HI> and <HI>Sweat</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Pi&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE generality of the Men look as if they had ju&s;t nock'd off their Fetters, and by an unexpected Providence, e&s;cap'd the danger of a near Misfortune, the dread of which, hath imprinted that in their <HI>Looks,</HI> which they can no more alter than an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> can his <HI>Colour.</HI></P>
<P>They are all <HI>Colonels, Majors, Captains, Lieutenants,</HI> and <HI>En&s;igns,</HI> the two la&s;t being held in &s;uch di&s;dain, that they are look'd upon as a <HI>Bungling Diver</HI> among&s;t a Gang of <HI>Expert Pick-pockets; Pride</HI> being their <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Impudence</HI> their <HI>Vertue.</HI></P>
<P>They regard nothing but Money, and value not how they get it, there being no other Felicity to be enjoy'd but purely Riches. They are very Civil to Strangers who bring over con&s;iderable Effects; and will try a great many ways to Kill him fairly, for the lucre of his Cargo: And many have been made Rich by &s;uch Wind|falls&punc;</P>
<P>A Broken <HI>Apothecary</HI> will make there a Topping <HI>Phy&s;ician;</HI> a <HI>Barbers Prentice,</HI> a good <HI>Surgeon;</HI> a <HI>Bayliffs Follower,</HI> a pa&s;&s;able <HI>Lawyer;</HI> and an <HI>Engli&s;h Knave,</HI> a very <HI>Hone&s;t Fellow.</HI></P>
<P>They have &s;o great a veneration for <HI>Religion,</HI> That <HI>Bibles</HI> and <HI>Common Prayer Books</HI> are as good a Commodity among&s;t them, as <HI>Muffs</HI> and <HI>Warming-Pans.</HI></P>
<P>A little Reputation among the <HI>Women,</HI> goes a great way; and if their Actions be an&s;werable to their Looks, they may vie <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> with the <HI>Devil:</HI> An <HI>Impudent Air,</HI> being the only <HI>Charms</HI> of their <HI>Countenance;</HI> and a <HI>Lewd Carriage,</HI> the <HI>Study'd Grace</HI> of their <HI>Deportment.</HI> They are &s;uch who have been <HI>Scandalous</HI> in <HI>England</HI> to the ut|mo&s;t degree, either <HI>Tran&s;ported</HI> by the <HI>State,</HI> or led by their <HI>Vicious Inclination;</HI> where they may be <HI>Wicked,</HI> without <HI>Shame;</HI> and <HI>Whore</HI> on, without <HI>Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>They are Stigmatiz'd with <HI>Nick-Names,</HI> which they bear, not with <HI>Patience</HI> only, but with <HI>Pride,</HI>as <HI>&V;ncon&s;cionable Nan, Salt-Beef Peg, Buttock-de-Clink Jenny,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Swearing, Drinking,</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;cene Talk,</HI> are the principal Qualifications that render them acceptable to <HI>Male Conver&s;ation;</HI> and &s;he that wants a perfection in the&s;e admirable Acquirements, &s;hall be as much Ridicul'd for her <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> as a <HI>Plain-dealing Man</HI> among&s;t a Gang of <HI>Knaves,</HI> for his <HI>Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Vertue</HI> is &s;o <HI>De&s;pis'd,</HI> and all &s;orts of <HI>Vice Encourag'd,</HI> by both <HI>Sexes,</HI> that the Town of <HI>Port Royal</HI> is the very <HI>Sodom</HI> of the Univer&s;e.</P>
