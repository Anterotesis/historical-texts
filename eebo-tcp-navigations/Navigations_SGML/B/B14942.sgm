<P>In the la&s;t victory that we had ouer the Ba|uarians, we burnt the towne of Sitigfur, and cha&s;ed the Bauarians: but the 16 of this mo|neth the enemy got vpon a certaine hill about halfe a mile from hence, whereupon the Ge|all Mansfield with 20 cornets of hor&s;emen and fiue regiments of foote marched thither to ioyne full battell with him; but the enemy that they might not ioyne battell, &s;topt the pa&s;&s;ages: but about eight of the clocke the musketiers met and skirmi&s;hed till the eue|ning. The enemy being put to the wor&s;e, lo&s;t great &s;poiles and many men, among whom was the Commander <HI>Baur,</HI> with many other Captaines and hor&s;emen.</P>
<P>The Lord Generall hath encamped neare vnto the Schans: men repaire vnto him very fa&s;t euery day: the Princes are &s;hortly to come together to make an agreement about &s;ome things. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Tilli</HI> is come halfe way and &s;o is the Graue of Solms too.

<P>It is certified vnto vs from Weenen that the Count Bucouoy with 80 hor&s;emen, a|mong&s;t whom were many of his mo&s;t prin|cipall officers going to take a view of a cer|taine Schans neare vnto Newheu&s;ell, was in|uironed by the Hungarians who &s;lue him and mo&s;t of his men: his body being thru&s;t tho|rough with a lance, was caried into his campe.</P>
<P>Thereupon they of Newheu&s;ell &s;et vpon the Emperours Legher with all their might, and &s;lue about two thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>And <HI>Bethlem Gabors</HI> men being vpon the frontiers of Morauia, burnt the towne of Ol|mits.</P>
<P>Moreouer, that the Emperour had &s;ent a generall pardon into Morauia, whereupon all the pri&s;oners were &s;et a libertie againe.</P>
<P>It is further &s;ignified vnto vs out of Sile&s;ia, that the Marc-graue of lagheren dorpe is &s;ix|teene thou&s;and &s;trong, at the charges of the Clergie, and hath be&s;ieged certaine townes in Bohemia to keepe the country in awe.</P>
<P>The truce in the Palatinate continueth till the fourth of Augu&s;t, in the meane time the countrimen are very much oppre&s;&s;ed by the Spani&s;h gari&s;ons, who will not &s;uffer them to mow their corne without giuing them much mony, whereby the fruits of the earth are &s;poi|led, and the countrymen runne away.</P>
<P>The Spaniards doe fortifie them&s;elues ex|ceedingly: many Dutch Lords being ioyned vnto them, which do make great preparation for warre; what the i&s;&s;ue will be, the time will manife&s;t. The &s;ouldiers in the Palatinate are for the mo&s;t part marched to the Earle of Mansfield, who lieth by Withen&s;ell, hauing a very great army.</P>

<P>On Friday la&s;t the body of the Lord <HI>Baur</HI> which was &s;laine by Mansfield in the fight be|fore mentioned, was brought hither from the Bauarian Legher, and embalmed, and from hence was by a conuoy of 30 hor&s;emen &s;ent towards Wietsburgh: but about a mile from hence they were &s;et vpon by two cornets of Mansfields hor&s;emen and a hundred musket|tiers, who brought them vnto Walt&s;axen with a good bootie al&s;o.

<P>The &s;hip of warre which lately &s;ailed by, lieth not far from the Schans of Papen-Muts, for what purpo&s;e &s;hee lyeth there, is yet vn|vnknowne.</P>
<P>Here both parties begin to &s;et vpon each other, for not long &s;ince two Capi&s;aines with certaine hor&s;emen were taken: and the re|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t goes, that the Gouernours haue receiued commandement to ioyne battel with the ene|my, and to &s;lay him or take him captiue.</P>
<P>All things are quiet in the&s;e quarters, men know not yet whether there &s;hall be peace or war, but it will be knowne within few dayes, and then the corne &s;hall be brought out of the fields with as much &s;peed as may be.</P>
<P>The Gouernour <HI>Pithen</HI> of Gulick hath writ|ten to <HI>Graue Hendrick vanden Berg</HI> to retaine his hor&s;emen, to the end that his &s;ouldiers of hor&s;e and foote might haue the freer pa&s;&s;age, which if he doth, no man &s;u&s;taining hurt or domage, he will doe the like for <HI>Graue Hen|dricks</HI> hor&s;emen.</P>

<P>Wee vnder&s;tand from Bru&s;&s;els that the <HI>In|fanta</HI> is not gone into the Cloi&s;ter, but is de|tained by <HI>Pater Dominico:</HI> the Marquis would haue that &s;he &s;hould remaine in gouernment till the 17 Prouinces are giuen to the dowrie, whereby they might gouerne and hold the land in good peace and vnitie, as they were left by the Arch Duke. Therefore there is a po&s;t &s;ent into Spaine for to know the Kings re&s;olution. Some doe thinke that <HI>Don Carlo</HI> his Maie&s;ties brother &s;hall be &s;ent to take the gouernment.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that tho&s;e of Rochell haue taken or &s;poiled 50 French &s;hips; and that the Ge|nerall of the Popes Gallies hath taken a Tur|ki&s;h Pirates &s;hippe, and made 35 Turkes &s;laues.</P>
<P>It is further &s;ignified from Venice that three men were lately taken and executed, which attempted to fire the &s;hips in the harbour.</P>
