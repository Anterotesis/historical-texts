<P>_WHereas the Trade of the <HI>Canary</HI>-Wines was heretofore carried on with much benefit and advan|tage to Our Subjects, by a great Vent and Exportation of the Native Commodities and Ma|nufactures of Our Kingdoms, and the Wines received in Exchange for tho&s;e Commodities, were u&s;ually, when Imported, &s;old at moderate and ea&s;ie Rates, until of late, by rea&s;on of the irregular and di&s;orderly Trading of Retailers, and other per&s;ons no ways experienced in that Trade, and of their extraordinary and un&s;ea&s;onable re&s;ort unto the &s;aid I&s;lands; with an unu&s;ual number of Ships, the Prices of tho&s;e Wines have be&eacute;n exce&eacute;dingly enhaunced, and the Commodities and Manufa|ctures of Our Kingdoms deba&s;ed in their Value by the Inhabitants of the &s;aid I&s;lands, and Our Sub|jects enforced to pay for a great part of tho&s;e Wines with Pieces of Eight, and Bills of Exchange, to the decay of Trade, and the decrea&s;e of the Trea&s;ure of Our Kingdoms: And whereas the Inhabitants of tho&s;e I&s;lands not contenting them&s;elves with the Bani&s;hment of Our Con&s;ul, and the principal Factors out of the I&s;land of <HI>Theneriff</HI> la&s;t year, have lately proce&eacute;ded further, and do openly Declare, That no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship what&s;oever &s;hall be permitted to Load or Vnload, or any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant to live among&s;t them; And the Governours of the &s;aid I&s;lands have publi&s;hed &s;everal Proclamations to that effect, and executed them with &s;uch &s;everity, That all Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants lately re&s;iding in tho&s;e I&s;lands, are quite turned off the &s;aid I&s;lands, and forced to leave their E&s;tates behind them, to their utter ruine. We therefore de&eacute;p|ly re&s;enting the&s;e injuries done to all Our loving Subjects, and re&s;olving not to &s;uffer the Indignities offer|ed to Our Self, have thought fit by the advice of Our Council, to Declare, and do hereby Publi&s;h and De|clare Our Royal Will and Plea&s;ure, That no Wines, nor any other Commodities of the Growth, Produ|ction, or Manufacture of the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, nor any other Merchandi&s;e what&s;oever from thence, &s;hall at any time hereafter be Imported into this Our Kingdom, or into any other of Our Kingdoms and Dominions, until Our Plea&s;ure &s;hall be further known, upon pain of forfeiting all the Wines, Commodities, and Mer|chandi&s;es &s;o Imported, and of incurring the utmo&s;t Penalty which can be inflicted upon the wilful Con|temners of this Our Royal Command. And We do hereby Charge and Command all and every of Our loving Subjects, of what degre&eacute; and condition &s;oever, as well in this Our Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> as in any other of Our Kingdoms or Dominions, That they pre&s;ume not to continue any Trade or Traffique with any of the Inhabitants of the &s;aid I&s;lands, nor to have any further Commerce with them, or &s;end any Ship or Ships thither, as they will an&s;wer the contrary at their perils. And all Merchants and Commanders of Ships now in Port, and Outward bound for the &s;aid I&s;lands, or any of them, are hereby Commanded not to proce&eacute;d in &s;uch their Voyage, upon pain of Our utmo&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure. And We do hereby &s;traitly Charge and Command all Farmers, Collectors, Waiters, and Officers of Our Cu&s;toms, and all other Our Officers and Mini&s;ters what&s;oever, That they pre&s;ume not to &s;uffer any Wines of the Growth of the &s;aid <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, or any other Commodities or Merchandi&s;e belonging to any of the Inhabitants of the &s;aid I&s;lands, or coming from thence, for the account of any other per&s;on or per&s;ons whom&s;oever, to be Landed at any the Ports of this Our Kingdom, or any other of Our Kingdoms or Dominions, until Our Plea&s;ure herein &s;hall be further known, as they will an&s;wer the contrary at their perils.</P>
