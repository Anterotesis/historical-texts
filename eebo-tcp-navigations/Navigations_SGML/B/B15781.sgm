<HEAD>&para; The true Coppie of Sir ANTHONY SHIRLIES Oration to the So|phie, as followeth.</HEAD>
<P>I Am &s;o a&s;&s;uredly fr&eacute;e from any iu&s;t imputation, that I will not draw into &s;u&s;picion &s;o noble a cau&s;e (as this of my comming with circum&s;tances,) which though they beare the name, yet are in &s;ub&s;tance nothing but vncertaine Excu&s;es that betoken a fault: whereas trueth &s;&eacute;eketh no &s;tarting-holes, but as a Pilgrim (who follow|eth the motion of his affections) is come from farre, to y&eacute;elde and pay vnto vertue his Zeale and Deuotion, and to none other end, if it may plea&s;e your Maie&s;tie to accept the con&s;ecration of his poore Carcas vnto you, which my minde hath caried hither to be made an Offering or hang|ing vow in the Temple of your mo&s;t &s;inguler vertues, be|ing brought to this point by the Extremitie of my de&s;ires, with expen&s;es of much time, and not without great perill: which though it be no Pre&s;ent in any degree of woorth e&s;ti|mable to &s;uch a Prince: it may plea&s;e your Maie&s;tie to re|member, that the pitch of an Eagles flight, doth farre &s;ur|mount
<PB REF="3"> the fluttering of a Flie, and that common ba&s;e Mindes are not Capable of &s;uch Noble Thoughtes, as might rai&s;e them&s;elues with the true &s;eeking of thie&s;e your mo&s;t rare &amp; worthie parts, which haue drawn me to your Pre&s;ence: whereof I haue hearde men &s;peake with wonder, &amp; now they giue me cau&s;e to think my &s;elfe mo&s;t happie. And therefore I humblie be&s;eech your Maie&s;tie, when you haue read the Hi&s;torie of the inward thoughtes of my minde, you will vouch&s;afe to iudge hereof, not as of conceiptes hanging of the thr&eacute;edes of flattering tearmes: but that you will be plea&s;ed to vnder&s;tande through the concience of your owne vertues, that wordes of neuer &s;oe great magnificence, are but the lea&s;t parte of &s;o high and excellent de&s;erte, and that the le&s;&s;e I am able to di&s;play their dignitie with my &s;peaches: the more will I with my Bloude make proofe of my zeale towardes them, if at any time I may be made worthie to be Commaunded by your Maie&s;tie.</P>
<P>I am a Souldier who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion is cleane contrarie to wordes, which &s;hall &s;ooner faile me, then my courage to greater effect. Yf the pre&s;ent be acceptable to your Ma|ie&s;tie, I &s;hall e&s;t&eacute;eme it as a mo&s;t &s;inguler good happe vnto me: but much more, if it &s;hall be imployed. For it would be but a very idle ende and conclu&s;ion of &s;o long a trauaile, full of &s;o many perrills, if it were knit vp with wordes on|ly, and a very poore and &s;lender harue&s;t of &s;o feruent Affe|ction, if it &s;hould bring foorth onely Buddes or Blo&s;&s;omes, and no &s;ounde Fruite: and finally too m&eacute;eke a Subiect for your Maie&s;ties mo&s;t excelent vertues, if my deuotion and ob&s;eruances were not &s;ealed with my Bloude, the which I do humble and fr&eacute;ely offer at your Maie&s;ties f&eacute;ete, to be &s;hed and &s;pent, at the lea&s;t &s;igne and token of your Maie|&s;ties plea&s;ure.</P>
