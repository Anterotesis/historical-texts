<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To the Dut|ches of Par|ma the 27. of April. 1582. with his owne hande.</NOTE> I haue an&s;wered al your highnes letters that came to my hande, and doe very de&s;irou&s;ly attende newes from thence of your highne&s;&s;e perfect recouerie, to the ende, to be ea&s;ed of my care in y^t by the la&s;t I hearde that the goute had not yet per|fectly left you. God for his mercie &s;ende
<PB REF="7"> me &s;hortly good tydinges. The letters which lately we haue had out of England putteth vs in hope that wee be deliuered of the Prince of Orenge, &s;ith the 14. day after his hurt (as they write thence) there was no more hope of his life, and the Q. of Englande was duely aduertized from time to time of the &s;tate of his hurt. They &s;ay moreouer, that he hath been grieuou&s;|ly tormented as well with the payne of his wound, as al&s;o, with the payne that he hath bin put to, partly by &s;uch incitions, as the &s;urgions haue made to come to the bottom of the hurt, &amp; partly by cauteries of towe for &s;topping of the blood: which yet they could not atteyne. It is pitie hee died not long &s;ince, together with a great number of his faction, namely. <HI>S. Alde|gonde.</HI> His death wil bread great altera|tions as is mo&s;t like, &amp; we loke for news of what haue &s;ince happened, and what cour&s;e matters haue taken. We heare that the duke of <HI>Anieow</HI> hath &s;ent the P. <HI>Daulphin</HI> to the king of France for &s;uc|cour, we &s;hall &s;ee what will come of it.

But we can haue no helpe of our power, ney|ther knowe it, or con&s;ider in what &s;tate tho&s;e bee that doe on all &s;ides di&s;quiet vs, yea &s;o farre as by procuring the di&s;cente of the Turkes armie, who I &s;uppo&s;e ve|rily woulde come, in cace the Per&s;ian warre, which yet continueth, did not let him, as hauing lately on that &s;ide had an ouerthrow of his people, wherevpon, ac|cording to the la&s;t newes, <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI> was much troubled, and the &s;ayde Turke hath &s;ent into his frontiers newe reliefe of two <HI>Sangiaques,</HI> with 4000. <HI>Iani&s;&s;aries,</HI> and 3000 <HI>Spachies,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding they giue out that they doe at|tende an emba&s;&s;adour out of Per&s;ia, who &s;houlde bring the conditions of peace, whiche I hope is but a voice to deceiue them, and that he hath to doe with a peo|ple that doe fight in running away.</P>
<P>My Lord of S. <HI>Va&s;tz</HI> went this way, and by po&s;te continueth his iourney to|warde
<PB REF="8"> the king, who is nowe at <HI>Almerin</HI> whether he went to meete the Empre&s;&s;e, and my Lorde the <HI>Archduke</HI> Cardinall is gone to receiue her vpon the confines of the kingdome. The &s;aide Abbot of S. <HI>Va&s;tz</HI> &s;eemeth a wary man, and &s;uche a one as can yeelde good accompte of the &s;tate of the Lowe Countreys. I enter|tayned him very well, and haue commen|ded him in the court, to the ende they may &s;o v&s;e him, that hee may returne well &s;a|ti&s;fied. I am well a&s;&s;ured that for his part he wil &s;ollicite the &s;ending of &s;ouldi|ers and money for the pay: whereabout I haue laboured the&s;e two monethes, cal|ling vpon it &s;o much as I might. And alreadie we haue worde from Sicill and Naples, that the power that &s;hould come thence, will marche very &s;hortly, &s;o to ioyne with Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Tolete,</HI> who is yet in the Neapolitayn gallies at <HI>Calibry,</HI> while Don <HI>Ihon</HI> of <HI>Cardoa,</HI> at|tendeth conuenient tyme to pa&s;&s;e the gulfe: and in troth, he is very &s;lacke. So as the Countie <HI>Oliuares,</HI> who is in the &s;ame gallies, is not yet gotten to <HI>Rome,</HI> to the great preiudice of the affayres: not|with&s;tanding
<PB REF="9"> his Holine&s;&s;e hath already graunted the &s;ub&s;idy, which he hath &s;tai|ed the&s;e three yeeres full vnder colour of the ab&s;tinence of warre, which <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Marliano</HI> had co~cluded with the Turke. I doe within the&s;e two dayes looke for the Prince <HI>Iohn Andrew Dorye,</HI> who returneth toward Italy with his Gal|leyes, and the Duke of <HI>O&s;&s;una</HI> goeth with him, who, as your highne&s;&s;e maye haue heard, goeth as <HI>Viceroy</HI> to <HI>Naples.</HI> His Maie&s;tie and all his blood thanked be God, are in good health, and we waite what re&s;olution they wil take after their Maie&s;ties haue beene together, who are to returne from <HI>Almarin</HI> to <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> where (if I be not deceiued) the Kinge hath yet enough to do: for concerning iu|&s;tice, gouernment, trea&s;urie, and &s;uche like concerning &s;urety, I &s;ee nothing yet done to my lyking: be&s;ides that, I wote not how his Maie&s;tie can without daun|ger leaue the Realme of Portingale. Our Nauy is prouiding, but &s;lowly ac|cording to cu&s;tome, &s;o as if wa~t of monie had not hindred <HI>Don Anthony</HI> &amp; the Q. Mother of Fra~ce, they had by this pre|ue~ted
<PB REF="9"> vs. The feare of the Turkes army hath cau&s;ed the leuie of 6000.

It is doubted whether the enterpri&s;e of <HI>Tercera</HI> &s;halbe executed this yeere, or whether they take any other order. God put into his Maie|&s;ties hart, that that may be for the be&s;t. It is &s;till &s;aid, that the Imperiall diet &s;halbe holde~ at <HI>Au&s;pburg,</HI> but I ca~not thinke it, it began vpon Sunday la&s;t, notwith&s;tan|ding the purport of y^e letters of conuoca|tion.

<P>Your highne&s;&s;e may haue heard howe it hath plea&s;ed his Maie&s;tie to nominate to the Bi&s;hoppricke of <HI>Turney Moril|lon,</HI> Prouo&s;t of <HI>Ayre.</HI> Al&s;o that I haue graunted to di&s;charge my &s;elfe of the

<P>We can come to no ende with the wi|dowe,
<PB REF="22"> who is a fooli&s;h woman, and hath euill coun&s;eile, I hope neuerthele&s;&s;e that time and friendes may mollifie her, and teach her to knowe her wrong. In the meane time my Lord of <HI>Secry</HI> waxeth &s;o liuely and practi&s;e in the language and knowledge of &s;pani&s;h affaires, that his empri&s;onment will not onely bee not vn|profitable to him, but al&s;o mo&s;t profitable.

Of this mi&s;happe wil redounde this benefite, that they &s;hall haue learned the &s;peeche and cu&s;tomes of the kingdome.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that his Maie&s;ties &s;oiour|ning at <HI>Lisbone</HI> is very fit for y^e reducing of the Hollenders &amp; Zeala~ders, who haue learned &amp; vnder&s;tood what y^e K. our M. is. Al&s;o that herewithal the P. of Ore~ges death, w^t is thought certayne, may breede great alteratio~: God graunt we may wel v&s;e this opportunitie.

<PB REF="23"> peace, a &s;trong war is nece&s;&s;arie.

Where|vpon I dare &s;ay his Maie&s;tie will v&s;e both wi&s;edome and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Your L. doeth greatly binde mee in &s;hewing &s;o great fauour towarde me, my kin&s;men and friendes.

A &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome of my yeeres pentions, in title of a Lorde of the priuie coun&s;ell, are yet behinde. I am to craue your Lord&s;hips fauour in the pay|ment thereof, towarde the reliefe of my mother, and other our wantes which are great, by rea&s;on of the great lo&s;&s;es whi|che in our goods wee haue &s;u&s;teyned du|ring the&s;e warres.

Wherevpon I digre&s;&s;ed in opening &s;undrye purpo&s;es concerning your highne&s;&s;e entent.

<P>The common opinion is, that in a|nye wi&s;e hee will in September returne to <HI>Madrill,</HI> as being both in <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Arragon</HI> greatly de&s;ired.

<PB REF="28"> truly is here as it were adored of the ba&s;e co~munaltie, &amp; it is &s;ayd that in Brittaine, there is a great army ready. Al&s;o in as much as they ca~not beate any places but what lyeth between <HI>Duore</HI> &amp; <HI>Mignio,</HI> his Maie&s;tie &s;endeth towarde the Citie of <HI>Porto</HI> the <HI>Prior Don Hernando</HI> with 10000. footmen and 800. hor&s;e, with whom he &s;hall keepe that Countrie. In this Citie there is a &s;ufficient garri&s;on. Al&s;o at <HI>Settubar</HI> a regiment of <HI>Almains;</HI> and y^e re&s;t of the fortre&s;&s;es hereabout are &s;ufficie~tly prouided. His Maie&s;ties &s;houl|ders are charged with greate expen&s;es. Al&s;o it may be the &s;hadow is bigger the~ the daunger, which is encrea&s;ed by him that endeuoured to hinder the &s;ending of any power of importa~ce into tho&s;e parts, as being but a &s;mall friend to our Prin|ces glory, and an vtter enemy to the pro|uiding of y^e remedy for y^e affaires of tho&s;e parts which haue by him beene lo&s;t and &s;ubuerted: &s;o as without farther &s;peeche your highnes doe well vnder&s;tande mee.</P>
<P>Howebeit as <HI>Don Iohn</HI> toulde mee, although his Maie&s;tie be to prouide for
<PB REF="28"> diuers Countries: yet is he re&s;olued to take order for greate proui&s;ion of coyne for the affaires of tho&s;e Countries, ney|ther will hee that the &s;ayde a&s;&s;ignation be imployed any other where. I am not &s;ure of the iu&s;t &s;umme, but I vnder&s;tande it will bee at the lea&s;t 2. millions of gold yeerely. The mo&s;t part of the &s;aide coine the <HI>Fouquers</HI> &s;hall prouide monethly at <HI>Collen.</HI> In <HI>Italy</HI> there is order taken for 4. or 5000. <HI>Italians,</HI> a fewe hor&s;emen, and 2. Regiments of <HI>Spaniardes,</HI> who all &s;hall marche thitherwardes. And in as much as I perceiued all this proui&s;ion to proceede but &s;lowely, and e&s;peciall that of coyne, (that is the principall) by the coun&s;ayle of <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> I determined to exhibite a briefe to his Maie&s;tie, the tenor of the copie whereof is here inclo&s;ed, the which together with other diligence v&s;ed coulde not but bring forth good effectes.</P>

<P>BE&s;eeching God this pre&s;ent may come to your Lo. and finde you in &s;uch health as I be&s;eech &amp; wi&s;h you.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Ia&s;per of Anna&s;tro.</NOTE></P>
<P>By the la&s;t ordinarie I writ to your Lorde&s;hippe of my occurrences. In the&s;e I will rehear&s;e the &s;ub&s;taunce thereof, &s;o farre as I can remember (for I keepe no copies of my writings) as al&s;o what el&s;e &s;hall come in my minde. For not being as then a&s;&s;ured of the princes death, I nowe &s;peake otherwi&s;e, then then I did, and although at that time I was earne&s;t with you to come &s;peedily hither, &s;o to get you from among tho&s;e bea&s;tes feete. Al&s;o that thervpon I writ you a perticu|lar, which in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity you &s;houlde
<PB REF="30"> &s;hewe to the prince, yet nowe I &s;ay, that by a letter which my father writt me the 23. of this moneth, his minde is, that your Lorde&s;hip come not pre&s;ently, vntill that the heate of <HI>Orenges</HI> death bee cooled, for that hee doubteth lea&s;t they haue layd your way, and &s;o you &s;hould haue greater labour &amp; payne to pa&s;&s;e them, then to re|mayne vnder the princes protection. Al|&s;o in re&s;pecte of &s;o &s;mall a&s;&s;uraunce, I thinke it meet (for preuenting what may happen) that you &s;ende me a proxie to re|couer of his Maie&s;tie that which he hath promi&s;ed you for this &s;eruice, with a &s;e|uerall note vnder your hande, in what maner you will that this quantitie bee employed and diuided: pre&s;cribing there|in howe muche you alowe mee for my paynes. For although my father a&s;|&s;ured mee of more then the thirde part, and that I was then content therewith: yet nowe I &s;ay, in con&s;ideration of &s;uche great depts as the Marchaunts doe pub|li&s;he, that your Lord&s;hip oweth, I will bee content with the fourth part: but if you be otherwi&s;e minded, you know that my father is a partie, which notwith&s;tan|ding
<PB REF="30"> I will procure him to be content w^t what I thinke good, &amp; therfore I be&s;eech you &s;et it &s;o down in your perticular note &amp; in&s;truction, to the ende wee may con|clude vppon that whiche concerneth this matter. For that is the way to deale for &s;ati&s;fiyng my father, be&s;ides that, &s;o your &s;elfe may be plea&s;ed, and he wil not faile in what&s;oeuer occurre~ce may happe~ about his Maie&s;tie. In the meane time, I pray God pre&s;erue you in &s;uch health as I do de&s;ire. I likewi&s;e put your Lord&s;hip in minde in the &s;aid in&s;truction, to make perticular mention, that you would haue before the high alter in the Church of the town or village, of whe~ce he was, a tombe built of &s;tone, in &s;uche forme &amp; maner, as you or I &s;hold appoint for y^e &s;laier of him. It were al&s;o good in my opinio~, to build a perpetuall chantry of 2. chapleyns. Al|&s;o to buy for the yong mans father &amp; mo|ther, or his nere&s;t kin&s;man 3. or 400. duc|kets of rent for them ioyntly to enioy: &amp; that they and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors might bee Lordes of the &s;ayde chantrie and tombe, &amp;c.</P>
<PB REF="31">
<P>Now I &s;ay the Chamber hath procured to learne of my Father who the yong man was, and of whence, therefore if they &s;houlde al&s;o require to &s;ee the demon&s;tra|tion, that your Lorde&s;hip maketh of your affayres, it were meete you declared at large, and di&s;cretely what&s;oeuer concer|neth the &s;ame. I &s;aid al&s;o that (if you coulde) you &s;houlde procure the perfecte picture of the &s;aide young man to be &s;ent hither, which your Lorde&s;hip may ea&s;ely doe con&s;idering the good nature where|with it hath plea&s;ed God to endue you: and &s;o you &s;houlde &s;ati&s;fie manie that are de&s;irous to knowe him. My cou&s;in <HI>Peter</HI> gaue mee warning that your Lord&s;hips creditors determined to mole&s;t my Lady your mother, purpo&s;ing to take away her goods for your debt. Al&s;o y^t he had writ|ten vnto her, to &s;ende &s;ome docket where|by to auoide this trouble, and &s;o inconti|nently I gaue my father notice, wi&s;hing him with all &s;peede to get forth two &s;ce|dules, which for this purpo&s;e, as al&s;o for preferring you before all the creditors of <HI>Peter Martinez</HI> of <HI>Arbalu,</HI> he had craued of his Maie&s;tie in your name: and that
<PB REF="31"> wee will procure to bee done, notwith|&s;tanding the king &s;eeketh to delay for a fewe dayes the ouerplus of &s;uche gratifi|cation as he oweth you. Whereupon, as al&s;o concerning other articles, pre&s;e~t|ly vppon tydinges of <HI>Orenges</HI> death I wrote a letter, the copie whereof I &s;ente to your Lord&s;hippe, and doe hope that you haue receaued it. For default wher|of I wil &s;e~d another, to y^e end you may &s;ee w^t what goodwil and &s;eruice I haue &amp; do employ my &s;elfe in your &s;eruice: not that I deale any whitt of my owne intere&s;t, but only of your Lord&s;hippe and of your hou&s;e, vntill I haue by Gods helpe brought and &s;et the~ cleare. I writ like|wi&s;e in my la&s;t, that becau&s;e it had been capitulated, I &s;ay, by woordes concluded with the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> that the billes of 80000. &s;houlde bee di&s;patched in my name, it were good for the accompli&s;h|ing thereof, that the &s;ayde In&s;truction which I require were &s;ent me, to y^e end I might worde by worde, accompli&s;h it ac|cording as your lord&s;hip &s;hould appoint.</P>
<P>And I &s;aide vnto <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> that it was requi&s;ite to haue <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> the

<P>Howebeit pre&s;uppo&s;e the afore&s;aide &s;o to bee, yet I writte to my father that if it plea&s;ed <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> to publi&s;he mee to haue been the partie that had giuen the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> I woulde with all my heart to do him &s;eruice do it: but I knowe not what re&s;olution they will take.</P>
<P>This I thought good to imparte vnto you, that you might vnder&s;tande it, There is a naughtie man in this Towne, who with exce&s;&s;iue libertie in my ab&s;ence, hath medled in your Lord|&s;hips affaires. E&s;pecially one day a|mong the re&s;t, in the pre&s;ence of Ladye
<PB REF="32"> <HI>Frauncis</HI> of <HI>Aratia</HI> who is heere, who al&s;o (as &s;hee is not troubled with the pippe) paide him home agayne pre&s;ently: in &s;uche wi&s;e, as they had gone together by the eares, had not one of the Kinges Secretaries wiues, in who&s;e pre&s;ence this argument begunne, &s;tepped betweene them. All was about Orenges death, &amp;c. And the &s;ame ho|ne&s;t man toulde a verye friende of myne but ye&s;terday, that hee knewe by &s;ome of credite, that <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> was in the di&s;grace of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> for certaine cau&s;es whiche there were not to bee &s;po|ken of, of him and his affayres: whiche when hee coulde not beare: he &s;ayde,</P>
<P>By the habitte of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> and S. <HI>Paule,</HI> if I coulde catche him, hee &s;houlde pay mee.</P>
<P>This likewi&s;e I thought good to cer|tifie your Lo. to the ende, If this bee a|mi&s;&s;e, wee might deale warily with this man. But if it bee otherwi&s;e, and wee may knowe that this wretche hath inuen|ted it, as he hath done other things, al&s;o that you be &s;ure, that neither by word nor
<PB REF="33"> writing you haue not &s;aide any thing a|gayn&s;t the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> then that you con&s;ider whether it were good that you writ one letter vnto him, al&s;o that y^e prince writ him another, to certifie him y^e you are his faithfull &s;eruaunt: and there|in your Lo. may &s;ay, that this hath bin publi&s;hed and giuen out, by rea&s;on of &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure conceaued again&s;t <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> natiue of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words"> for that is the cau&s;e why I tell you this wretches name, and no other: for now it is no time to make enemies, e&s;pecially if heerein this man hath reported the trueth.</P>
<P>Sende me woorde whether you made any Bargaine with the Man&s;leyer: For this wretch here &s;aith, that he was a cut|lers &s;onne of <HI>Bilbao,</HI> and that hee will cau&s;e his father to repayre to the king, for the rewarde which his Maie&s;tie by his la&s;t edict offered to him that &s;houlde &s;tay <HI>Orenge.</HI> In ca&s;e he &s;hould haue au|dience, they might bring our pretence in que&s;tion. This is the cau&s;e why I &s;peak: but if your Lo. woulde pre&s;ently let me vnder&s;tand, who or of whence this young man was, wee woulde enter acquain|taunce
<PB REF="33"> with his father and mother, or his nighe&s;t kindred, and &s;o compounde with them that they &s;houlde not di&s;turbe or hinder your Lo. rewarde. And ad|mitte they can not haue it, yet will they &s;till trouble vs. For although the king woulde not doe as I &s;ay, yet might hee commaunde your Lord&s;hippe to giue the youngmans father, or neere&s;t kin&s;man, part of that belongeth to you. Your Lord|&s;hippe mu&s;t therefore well con&s;ider here|of: and &s;ende me worde of your minde, to the ende, by good coun&s;ayle, we may or|der this matter, which is of &s;o great im|portance.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of the plea&s;ure that the reue|rent father <HI>Peter of Olaue</HI> hath done in helping me in &s;o fitte a time vnto 200. crownes, I tru&s;t God willing, this day &s;euennight to depart homeward toward my hou&s;e, where your wor&s;hippe may write to mee and commaunde mee. Al&s;o, if your habilitie coulde beare it, to helpe mee as I haue reque&s;ted, with 500. Duc|kets, toward y^e reparations of my hou&s;e, your wor&s;hippe might greatly binde me to your &s;eruice: but if you doe it not, I
<PB REF="34"> will impute it to your want.</P>
<P>Thus commending my &s;elfe to Sir <HI>Olaue,</HI> I wil ad no more, but that I &s;end this by meanes of the Lorde emba&s;&s;ador <HI>Iohn Babti&s;ta Ta&s;&s;us,</HI> whom I be&s;eeche carefully to &s;end it to Sir <HI>Olaue.</HI> I al|&s;o pray your wor&s;hip, to let me vnder&s;ta~d of your receipt hereof, who&s;e noble par|&s;on and e&s;tate, our Lorde God keepe and pre&s;erue as I de&s;ire.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To the gene+rall payma|&s;ter of the P. of Parma his armie.</NOTE> I haue receiued your letter, dated the 18. of Februarie. which notwith&s;tanding, it lay aboue two moneths by the way, yet came in &s;o good time, that together with y^e &s;upply of 200. crownes w^c you &s;ent me there w^t, I hope godwilling w^tin the&s;e 8. daies to go home to my hou&s;e, where God willing you &s;hal alwayes finde mee readye at your com|maunde,

<P>Concerning the e&s;tate of <HI>Arcauty</HI> his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. I a&s;&s;ure you (as peraduenture you haue hearde) although he lay at <HI>Paris</HI> vnder the name of his Maie&s;ties factor, yet had his highne&s;&s;e taken expre&s;&s;e order that no money &s;hould come to his hands: but be altogether deliuered to <HI>I&s;uard Ca|pello,</HI> and after to <HI>Elias</HI> and <HI>Simon Cal|uia,</HI> which was pre&s;ently perfourmed in &s;uch wi&s;e as <HI>Arcauty</HI> was not bounde to any accompt of mony by him receiued. But he tooke order in his great di&s;compt of 36300. crownes. whereof he had gi|ue~ bils of exchange vnto &s;uch marchants as he had dealt w^t, notwith&s;tanding, there came neuer a peny into his handes, as I
<PB REF="35"> &s;aid, but to <HI>Capello</HI> &amp; <HI>Caluia,</HI> w^t neuerthe|les was very indi&s;cretly done of his high|ne&s;&s;e in re&s;pect of <HI>Arcauty:</HI> for it was a very ab&s;urde matter, to deliuer letters of exchange for that money that neuer came to his handes, although it fell out well.</P>
<P>And if after giuing vp of that accompt, hee had gone home to his owne hou&s;e, as he purpo&s;ed when he came hither, he had not bin at that point that nowe he is at.</P>
<P>But he &s;tayed in this Court almo&s;t <HI>2.</HI> yeeres, onely to cleare him &s;elfe of the theft of <HI>28000.</HI> crownes, which he &s;aieth <HI>Alphon&s;e Curiel</HI> hath committed, from his Maie&s;tie, ari&s;ing of two Commi&s;|&s;ions of <HI>55000.</HI> crownes: for when hee had here receiued them out of the Cheft with thre keys, he di&s;bour&s;ed not there a|boue <HI>22000.</HI> So that when the factor, who is <HI>Curiels</HI> kin&s;man, or at the lea&s;te his very friende, came to be chiefe of the Coun&s;ell of acompts in Flaunders, he did &s;o informe him, as well by worde of mouth, as al&s;o by certayne the writinges of <HI>I&s;uarde Capell, Arcautyes</HI> enemie, that he made him beleeue, that <HI>Arcauty</HI> ought the &s;aide <HI>28000</HI> crownes, &s;o that
<PB REF="35"> thus w^tout farther a do, they haue brought him to that e&s;tate he is now in. But the receauer is &s;caped out of theyr hands, as he who gat the licenciat <HI>chumacero</HI> his maie&s;ties coun&s;ayler, who is the vi&s;iter of the coun&s;ell of <HI>Demaynes</HI> &amp; other the Kinge his officers to be the iudge of his cau&s;e: but when the factor and his com|mi&s;&s;ioners perceiued that all they went about, was &s;mally to the purpo&s;e, they woulde not directly charge the &s;ayd <HI>Ar|cauty,</HI> but did, and &s;till do greatly mole&s;t him. Howebeit, it is &s;ayde that <HI>Chuma|cero</HI> will &s;oone ende this matter, and that the affection of the&s;e Iudges will &s;oone be &s;pied. Of whom the one is <HI>Al|fons Carner,</HI> who hath playde him the wor&s;t tricke of frind&s;hippe that any man coulde: as if him &s;elfe had liued <HI>&s;ine cri|mine.</HI> In this e&s;tate doe the receiuers affayres now &s;tande.</P>
<P>Where you de&s;ire to knowe whether bringing in&s;tructions from the generall receiuers, hee might bouldly come to giue vp his accomptes: I &s;ay he may, &s;o that the &s;aide in&s;tructions bee effectuall: al&s;o that there bee &s;et downe both the re|cepts
<PB REF="36"> and di&s;bour&s;ings of the mony. By this meanes, together with bringing mo|ney for your expences, you may ea&s;ely &s;toppe that gappe: for the King alloweth neyther wages nor any other thing vnto the Lo. of <HI>Vnceta,</HI> who &s;tayeth here about giuing vppe of <HI>Lexaldi</HI> the receiuers ac|compts and his owne, yea it is &s;aide he will not giue him &s;o much as a loafe of breade. I am therefore of opinion, that if you coulde get your accompt to be pa&s;|&s;ed there, you &s;hould &s;aue much, both mo|ney and labour: but if not, bee of good cheare, for by the meanes afore&s;ayde you &s;hall giue the phi&s;ition a figge. Father, &s;o &s;oone as God will giue mee leaue to gette to <HI>Victoria,</HI> I will immediatly &s;ende you your predece&s;&s;ors relation, as curious and braue as you coulde wi&s;he, for vntill then I can not for the cau&s;es that aforetime I haue &s;hewed you.

<PB REF="36">
<P>At his comming, I pray you &s;alute him from me, and will him to doe that he toulde me. Al&s;o that Lady Mary and her &s;onne were in good health the <HI>20.</HI> of this pre&s;ent. I heare &s;o much of the child, that notwith&s;tanding euery man affirmeth it, yet I can not beleeue it. God pre&s;erue him to his &s;eruice. Amen. The proui+der the <HI>23.</HI> of this moneth, was in &s;uche health as my &s;elfe &s;tande in neede of, and laboureth &s;till to re&s;igne his office vnto me: but he ca~not compa&s;&s;e it. He wil god|willing, tarry &s;till at home: &s;ome &s;ay his Maie&s;tie will &s;ende him into the Lowe Countreys with the &s;ouldiers that &s;hall goe thither, to be their generall commi&s;|&s;arie: but I knowe he will not take it vp|on him, vnle&s;&s;e he helpe me to the other: al&s;o that in ca&s;e I haue it, hee will not re|fu&s;e any thing. But make not me author hereof. In the &s;ayde letters of the <HI>23.</HI> it is &s;ayde, that his Maie&s;tie departed the <HI>19.</HI> out of <HI>Lisbone,</HI> to meete his &s;i&s;ter the Empre&s;&s;e. Al&s;o that hee returneth the tenth of May, wholy to receiue her.</P>
<P>Al&s;o that the great Prior is in the fielde,
<PB REF="37"> with whome there &s;hall ioyne <HI>8000. Ca|&s;tilian</HI> &s;ouldiers, <HI>4000. Almaynes,</HI> and <HI>800.</HI> Hor&s;es of the garde of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and that with that campe hee &s;hall goe to vi|&s;ite all the houldes and countreys bee|tweene <HI>Oporto</HI> and <HI>Bayon</HI> in <HI>Callice.</HI></P>
<P>The cau&s;e is &s;ayde to bee for that <HI>Don Anthony</HI> is in Fraunce, furni&s;hing him &s;elfe to come vpon vs, but I can not thinke that. But his Maie&s;tie will &s;toppe him, and &s;o hee may make a fayre hande with the&s;e people. If hee were heere, though it &s;eeme vnpo&s;&s;ible, yet manye woulde be very glad. From <HI>Guipu&s;coa</HI> there came to him <HI>18.</HI> &s;hippes gallantly furni&s;hed with aboue <HI>1500.</HI> Marriners, I wot not what to &s;ay of it: and althogh here were a voice of late that when the Empre&s;&s;e was comen into Portingale his maie&s;ty would goe to <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> yee now is there no more &s;peache: where|upon wee may gather that vntil he &s;eeth the end of this frenche dealing, hee will not out of this realme. It is &s;aid that within the&s;e few dayes the great Chap|leyne of Portingall was in hande with him in the behalfe of the Realme. And
<PB REF="37"> hat although his Maie&s;tie did them great honor in bringing his &s;i&s;ter to go|uerne them, yet &s;hould they greatly com|playne of his departure, &s;ithe nowe he knewe both the e&s;tate, qualitie and go|uernours of the kingdome. But the K. vnder&s;tanding whereat the Chapleyne leueled, made him this an&s;were. My &s;i&s;ter knowing mee to haue heere &s;o great af|fayres, woulde not but come to &s;ee mee.</P>
<P>Thus the Chapleyn could not vnder|&s;tande his purpo&s;e: &s;o great is his Ma|ie&s;ties di&s;cretion.</P>

<P>MO&s;t noble L. &s;ith the copie of my former writing vnto you is here|vnto adioyned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To y^e prince of Parma.</NOTE> I will certifie you onely of what haue &s;ince happened me. The Abbot of Saint <HI>Va&s;tz</HI> arriuing here the 16. of this pre&s;ent, did deliuer mee that which your highne&s;&s;e writte mee the <HI>27.</HI> of Februarie. Al&s;o whiles very earne&s;tly wee wayted for newes from your high|ne&s;&s;e, there arriued ye&s;terday a po&s;t here, by whom I receiued the letters which it plea&s;ed you to &s;ende the <HI>16.</HI> of this mo|neth, whereunto I will make a &s;hort an|&s;were, becau&s;e the po&s;te of <HI>Italy</HI> by whom I alwayes write, is this day to be di&s;pat|ched. <HI>Cardinall Granuelle</HI> entertay|ned the &s;ayde Abbot at his hou&s;e: where|in I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him vntill hee departed to|warde his Maie&s;tie, whiche was the <HI>20.</HI> of this moneth. I &s;hewed him what your highne&s;&s;e writte vnto mee: al&s;o howe he &s;houlde behaue him &s;elfe: wherein I will not there fayle him. I de&s;ired him to let me vnder&s;tand if there were any thing
<PB REF="39"> wherein I might do him any plea&s;ure. I writ al&s;o to <HI>D. Iohn</HI> of <HI>Idiaxz</HI> how eare|ne&s;tly he had trauayled to bring y^e e&s;tates to this re&s;olutio~ y^t they haue taken. Al&s;o that it were good y^t his maie&s;tie lett him vnder&s;tand that your highnes informed him of the whole, with what &s;o euer els I thought meete. Concerning the re|turne of the &s;ouldiers that are departed out of the&s;e e&s;tates, al&s;o of the <HI>Italians</HI> that are to goe with them, I can &s;ay no|thing: onely I was glad to vnder&s;tand that his Maie&s;tie hath nominated &s;uche Captaynes ouer them to guide them, as your highne&s;&s;e doeth &s;o well like of, and as is meete for his Royall &s;eruice, and I a&s;&s;ure my &s;elfe, hee will &s;o deale in your highne&s;&s;e behalfe, by rea&s;on of the great loue he beareth you.</P>
<P>That which now me &s;eemeth the be&s;t, is the furniture of coyne, and &s;urely if I coulde doe anye more then put him in minde thereof, your highne&s;&s;e &s;hould not de&s;ire it more. But I haue done that, and doe it &s;till, yea and dayly will vpon euery opportunitie, con&s;idering howe euident it is, that your highne&s;&s;e can doe nothing
<PB REF="40"> without that &s;ub&s;taunce.

I haue put both of them in minde, and will ad|uerti&s;e your highnes of their re&s;olution. The Cardinall &s;hewed mee howe de&s;i|rous hee was of this re&s;olution: Al&s;o howe often hee had propounded it, wil|ling mee to doe the like. I &s;uppo&s;e that the ordinarie proui&s;ion that is to bee made, dependeth vndoubtedly vpon the pre&s;ident of the Tre&s;urie: for I haue tal|ked with him, and he maketh mee no an|&s;were to the purpo&s;e. But &s;ith this is ordered by the way of e&s;tate, it is no mar|uell.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Madams</HI> health and recouerie, all wee your highnes &s;eruauntes are ve|rye glad, and rea&s;on. The contrarye whereof we doe feele, in that the French haue opportunitie to try that they do, and to bring all into triall, but I hope in God that in the ende, by meanes of &s;uch order and foreca&s;t as your highne&s;&s;e will in all
<PB REF="40"> places v&s;e, they &s;hall reape no fruite of their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>We haue of late dayes greatly wi&s;h|ed for letters from your highne&s;&s;e, to re|&s;olue the doubt conceiued of the death of <HI>Orenge,</HI> the newes being here &s;o diuers, as well from <HI>Paris</HI> as <HI>Antwerpe.</HI> All wi&s;e men thinke him dead, and &s;o we are to beleeue, although it be &s;trange, y^t your highne&s;&s;e cannot fully verifie it. There came newes from <HI>Lisbone</HI> that hee was in extremities, and here it was &s;ayde that he was dead: But his fautors had concea|led it a fewe dayes, whyle they tooke or|der in their owne affayres.</P>
<P>I will write vnto <HI>Vela&s;ques</HI> of <HI>Mina|ya,</HI> who is of his Maie&s;ties chamber, con|cerning the good you haue done him, and doe &s;till wi&s;he to doe, neyther can it bee but many will like well of it, that your highnes are &s;o willing to fauour &amp; plea|&s;ure his Maie&s;ties &s;eruauntes, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are &s;o neere his royall per&s;on.</P>
<P>I doe infinitely thanke your highnes for the plea&s;ure it plea&s;ed your highne&s;&s;e to &s;hewe mee, in thanking his Maie&s;tie, and honouring his &s;eruantes. The great

<P>The liberty and commoditie that your highne&s;&s;e haue giuen mee to di&s;tribute a|mong &s;undry per&s;ons, to the yeerely va|lue of two or three hundred crownes, as my &s;elfe &s;hall thinke good, was verye comformable to your highne&s;&s;e mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> noble &s;eruice.

He had neede leaue &s;ome proui&s;ion of money with his mother, but for that, and any o|ther thing needefull for his iourney, hee will &s;eeke the be&s;t remedy hee may.

<P>Farther, although there were no other cau&s;e but y^e only electio~ of y^e people of this Realme, who for default of kings, are by their decrees and ordinances to chu&s;e o|thers: yet was it inough, that your Maie|&s;tie entred the lande with an armie, the controuer&s;ie not being decided: for had your title bin neuer &s;o good, yet had you thereby vtterly lo&s;t it.

If your maie&s;tie woulde but thinke vpon y^e houre of your death, together with the euils that then will offer them &s;elues to your view, and remember that you are e|uerla&s;tingly to &s;uffer the paynes whiche you haue inflicted vpon the <HI>Portingalls</HI> perceiuing then howe neere the lo&s;&s;e of all is vnto you; Oh! howe woulde you turne a&s;ide from all that is pa&s;t: for at y^t time it will bee before your eyes. Howe much better had it bin for you, quietly to haue remained in your own realme, to &s;ee your va&s;&s;als in peace, your &s;elfe beloued of all Chri&s;tians, and obeyed of all your &s;ubiectes! for in re&s;pect of that you haue

That which the inhabita~ts of this afflic|ted realme doe endure, is &s;ufficient to let you know, that they which are out of this bondage and heauie yoke, do couet rather freely to dye in the warres, then to fall in|to &s;uch &s;lauery: neither will I otherwi&s;e coun&s;ell the inhabitants of this Ile, lea&s;t
<PB REF="46"> I &s;houlde both damne my &s;oule, and my honor &s;hould fall into le&s;&s;e reputation the~ nowe it is in.

For to die well is perpetuall honor, for the pre&s;eruation wherof, I had rather per&s;euer in loyalty, then feare the preparatiues of people, &s;hippes, and mu|nition, wherewith your Maie&s;tie doeth threaten me: for I haue &s;uch a confidence in God, that hee will fight for vs &amp; our &s;hips. The &s;ea &amp; hauens of this Ilande, together with the foretre&s;&s;es, walles, and trenches are ready for the munition: yea, and many pittes opened, whereinto to ca&s;t tho&s;e people y^t &s;hall come to &s;eeke vs, who are not to haue any pardon, by rea|&s;on of &s;uch mi&s;chiefe as proceedeth of for|giuing them.

<PB REF="46">
