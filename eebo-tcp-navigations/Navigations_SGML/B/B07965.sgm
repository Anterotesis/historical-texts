<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_WE had rather a great deale (gentle reader) pre&s;ent you with the happy newes of the Articles of Agree|ment betweene Chri&s;tian Princes, and that they would once li&s;ten to the pru|dent aduice of our <HI>Engli&s;h Salomon</HI> who labours to make all Countreys happy like his owne, that in his dayes there might bee abundance of peace. But &s;ince God is yet plea&s;ed for the
<PB REF="4"> &s;innes of Chri&s;tendome to &s;et euerie mans Sword again&s;t his Brother; Wee therefore knowing all men de&s;irous of newes, be it either good or bad, haue purpo&s;ed (&s;o farre as the power of Au|thoritie &s;hall licence vs) to publi&s;h the weekely occurrences which come to our hands: Our chiefe intention being to &s;tay the vncertaine reports of partiall newes-mongers, who tell euery thing as them&s;elues would haue it; And in this Continuation, though wee cannot hope to make euery reader beleeue what we write, yet neuerthele&s;&s;e we will not publi&s;h any thing, but either from a &s;ure hand, or &s;ome relation, &s;econded and confirmed by others: What we re|ceiue in doubtfull termes, wee will not report peremptorily, but you &s;hall haue it as we receiue it, neither will we print
<PB REF="4"> euery report. And although to con|fe&s;&s;e truth, we wi&s;h well, yet that we are not partiall, you may perceiue by our relating this skirmi&s;h betweene Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and M^r^. <HI>Tilly.</HI> Wee write a continuation, that you may &s;ee by the proceedings, that there is good dependancy betweene the relations, wherein we purpo&s;e to keepe nere to the Lawes of Hi&s;torie, to gue&s;&s;e at the rea|&s;ons of the actions by the mo&s;t apparant pre&s;umptions, and to &s;et downe the true names and di&s;tances of places, and times, that you may perceiue, there is probability in the &s;euerall Atchieue|ments.

<HEAD>A CONTINVATION of more Newes from the PALATINATE.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter that defeat of the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> and his flight into his owne <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and his iour|ney thence into <HI>Brisgoia,</HI> to try what forces hee could gather among the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Swit|zers,</HI> for the reenforcing of his lo&s;t Army: The whole countrey thereabouts, with the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Spyres,</HI> was left to the deuotion of the King of <HI>Bohemiah,</HI> now by this victory of <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> made &s;ole ma&s;ter of the field; whereupon the <HI>Man&s;feldians</HI> made what rauage they plea&s;ed in that delicate and mo&s;t fruitfull countrey: And the Count <HI>Van Hannow</HI> of the lower <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> (neigh|bour to <HI>Leopoldus)</HI> taking into his due con&s;ideration, that rule of warre; When two powerfull Princes are either declared or engaged in a warre, it hath beene &s;till ob&s;erued to be a dangerous thing, for any third man to &s;tand as a neutrall, who is not able again&s;t either of them to &s;tand of him&s;elfe: For &s;till the Victor when he hath ouerthrowne the ene|mies, falls next vpon the weaker Neuters: So that if the Victor has lei&s;ure afterward to pro&s;ecute them,
<PB N="2" REF="6"> it is as &s;afe almo&s;t, for to haue beene a dependant on the vanqui&s;hed, as to haue beene onely a looker on: whereas a third man that is of equal power to either of the two <HI>Antagoni&s;ts,</HI> &s;hall be &s;ure to be &s;olicited by either &s;ide; Fir&s;t for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and if that bee denyed, then &s;eeing hee plea&s;es not to bee a friend, that he would not a&s;&s;i&s;t the enemy, neither by &s;uf|fring any of his troupes to pa&s;&s;e through his coun|trey, nor that the Campe bee &s;upplyed with meat, munition, Armes, &amp;c. from him: And hee may &s;till take his aduantage to chu&s;e whom to &s;ide withall; or after the victory he may yet bee welcome to the Victor, or remaine &s;till a Neuter: whereas an inferi|our Prince, mu&s;t either come in to the Victor or be ruined, when hee that is too &s;trong for him, pur|po&s;es to make neutrality occa&s;ion of a quarrell. This con&s;ideration peraduenture this Count <HI>Van Hannow,</HI> made v&s;e of, which made him offer his &s;eruice to the King: who &s;peedng well, as being re|ceiued both into friend&s;hip &amp; protection, yet &s;o into protection, &amp; vpon &s;uch conditions, as free Princes v&s;e to accept a dependancy vpon a &s;tronger party, that is, not to be made a &s;ubiect, but an Allie and Confederate: Who&s;e example hath beene &s;uch a leading ca&s;e to others, that a Captaine of much ex|perience, good intelligence, and able iudgement in tho&s;e affaires, who (in his letters from <HI>Manhem May.</HI> 22.) hath related this &s;tory, infers thus much thereupon in his very next &s;yllables. And I hope (&s;aith he) ere long of a greater fortune.</P>
<P>The 18. of May, they tooke in <HI>Bu&s;we&s;ter,</HI> next to
<PB N="3" REF="6"> <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> and in it 250 Centeries of Powder, 200 of Match, with &s;ome Bullets, a murthering peece, and certaine other Ordnance. Thence he went to <HI>Cotton</HI> and tooke that in. <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> thus left behind without an enemie, and with &s;ome friends in it, comming neerer home towards the Palatinate; The King &amp; Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> wnet to <HI>Spyers</HI> the chiefe City (and a faire one too) in that Bi&s;hoprike; and be&s;ides that the very chamber of the Empire, where (by this pa&s;|&s;age it &s;eemes) they were as &s;afe, as they had been in <HI>Heidlebergh.</HI> For thither came the Marques of <HI>Baden</HI> to them, where vpon a coun&s;ell of War it was agreed that their two Armies &s;hould thus &s;euerally bee di&s;|po&s;ed of: That the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>Spiers</HI> being neere his <HI>Baden,</HI> &s;hould a while &s;tay to &s;ecure tho&s;e parts either again&s;t a revolt, or an enemy that &s;hould pa&s;&s;e through that way, His Leaguer (a &s;hort one though it were) he was to make at <HI>Ger&s;ham,</HI> and withall, to block vp <HI>Eddenham,</HI> the only place of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Spiers</HI> in tho&s;e parts, which it &s;eemes he did in &s;ome 7. or 8. dayes; for this agreement being made about the 12. the King pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Neckar</HI> with his Army at <HI>Manhem</HI> on the 20. And the Marque&s;&s;e (hauing all &s;ure at his backe) pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Germer&s;heim</HI> the 21. to fetch his Army which yet was in his owne Countrey, and about the 23 or 24. was to pa&s;&s;e to follow the Kings Army into <HI>Derm|&s;tadt:</HI> (of which wee gaue you an Item in our la&s;t newes printed the 3. and 5. of <HI>Iune.)</HI> But before we tell you what hath there beene done, will you plea&s;e to take &s;ome of the rea&s;ons of the inva&s;ion of this
<PB N="4" REF="7"> Country abroad before the Palatinate were cleered of enemies at home. Tis iudged, that now this grow|ing time of the yeare any Warriour had rather liue vpon his enemies Countrey, then de&s;troy his owne; Againe, for that <HI>de Tilly</HI> is not fir&s;t medled withall, may be, for that the <HI>Mansfieldians,</HI> thinke it better to fetch their victuall &amp; provi&s;ion out of this rich and vntouched Countrey, then to lye &s;tarving in a Summer Leager, before a full enemie. Againe, the Prince of this <HI>Derm&s;tadt,</HI> though hee bee of the hou&s;e of the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;en,</HI> who is a <HI>Caluini&s;t;</HI> yet is he a Chatholick, and as &s;ome &s;ay, a Bi&s;hop too, and hath hitherto furni&s;hed and befriended the ene|mies of the Palatinate; which they purpo&s;e by this inva&s;ion, to di&s;able him from doing hereafter. And there, againe, was the place of meeting appointed be|tweene the King and the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> the day prefixed being the 26. of May pa&s;t (after the old &s;tile.) The place, vpon the River <HI>Mayne</HI> towards <HI>Franckford,</HI> as we before told you. And indeed this expedition was chiefly intended to open the pa&s;&s;age for him, and withall to hinder the Baron of <HI>Anhalts</HI> comming to <HI>Dirlandt</HI> in <HI>He&s;&s;en,</HI> and &s;o to M. <HI>Tilly:</HI> that &s;o by ioyning of 3. faire Armies, the King may bee at once, ab&s;olute Mai&s;ter of the field therabouts, and be able to giue lawes to all <HI>Germanie</HI> if he plea&s;e: And the Armies kept together, or divided, accor|ding to their be&s;t advantage. But it &s;eemes that the Duke hath &s;omething diverted his Armes to pur&s;ue other de&s;ignes. For about the 10. of May he gaue the overthrow to the Baron of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> and &s;lew 2000
<PB N="5" REF="7"> of his men; which battell, (as the advice from <HI>Cul|len</HI> written the 19. of May after the old &s;tyle, &s;ayes) was &s;trooke neere <HI>Soltkott</HI> betweene <HI>Gezek</HI> and <HI>Pa|derborn.</HI></P>
<P>And next, on the 18. of May he went to <HI>Lisfelt,</HI> where he demanded 150000. dollers of the Can|nons of the Abbey; and they offered 80000, but how they &s;ped, iudge you. And by letters from the <HI>Hage</HI> the 20. <HI>of May,</HI> it appeares he was &s;ince againe at <HI>Hilde&s;hem,</HI> which he hath reduced: And the 26. of <HI>May</HI> being appointed for the meeting with the King about <HI>Frankford;</HI> It &s;eemes that &s;ome proiect of his vpon the rich Abbey of <HI>Fulda,</HI> which &s;tands at the Citie of <HI>Fuld,</HI> vpon a riuer of that name too; which is in <HI>He&s;&s;en;</HI> about the degrees, 32. 51. This Citie being well watered, is rich in pa&s;ture, and in flockes, and e&s;pecially their commoditie comes in by wooll; which was the rea&s;on of the planting of a famous Mona&s;tery there, accounted among&s;t the greate&s;t and riche&s;t of Germanie; and among&s;t them is the Duke; whether to &s;ing Ma&s;&s;e or no, I know not. But at this place he was yet about the 28. of <HI>May,</HI> it being &s;ome ten or twelue German myles from Franckfort the appointed place of meeting. Yet neuerthele&s;&s;e the King and Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> (the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baden</HI> following within three dayes) went on into <HI>Derm&s;tadt;</HI> which iourney was rather a progre&s;&s;e of plea&s;ure, (as if the Army had gone on|ly to take the ayre) then a warlike expedition; for as they were not medled withall in their march, nei|ther by <HI>Cordoua,</HI> who (we told you) had &s;ent all his
<PB N="6" REF="8"> hor&s;e to <HI>Tyllye,</HI> nor by <HI>Tyllye</HI> him&s;elfe; who lying to expect &s;ome forces of <HI>Bucquoyes,</HI> and <HI>Dampiers</HI> old Regiments, thought him&s;elfe not yet &s;trong enough to di&s;turb them, but kept his leager about <HI>Heidleberg:</HI> So in the country it &s;elfe they found neuer an enemy to re&s;i&s;t them; which made the ta|king in of the towne of <HI>Derm&s;tadt</HI> it &s;elfe, rather a &s;port then a &s;iege. And in the Ca&s;tle was the <HI>Landt|graue</HI> and his &s;onne with him &s;urprized at vnawares, for he neuer &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected an inua&s;ion; either &s;o &s;ecret was that re&s;olution of <HI>Spiers</HI> kept, or hee &s;o &s;ecure and negligent. But &s;eing his land full of &s;oldiers: which once di&s;cerned not to be his owne, nor his friend <HI>Tillyes,</HI> hee offers an e&s;cape; vpon which as if hee had confe&s;t guiltie, and &s;omething withall vnder his owne hand being &s;hewed again&s;t him, he was made pri&s;oner, and brought to <HI>Man|hem.</HI> This being done as &s;uddenly as hee did that, who wrote <HI>veni, vidi, vici,</HI> that is, in &s;ome foure dayes; in which time the &s;oldiers would want no victuals, there being &s;uch &s;tore of cattle in the coun|trey, that at the citie of <HI>Franckford,</HI> (as by letters from thence the 26. of <HI>May</HI> appeares) whither the&s;e boote-halers droue their pillage, a Calfe was &s;old for two &s;hillings, &amp; a &s;heep for one &s;hilling En|gli&s;h, &amp; yet they wanted chapmen at that price too; &s;o that the &s;oldiers are very flu&s;h: And vpon the 25 of <HI>May</HI> many thou&s;ands of Ricks dollars were ta|ken vpon the water at <HI>Ouenbach,</HI> by 10. Rijters or hor&s;emen. And it is reported that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> will haue 4. Tunne of gold of the&s;e cities herea|bouts,
<PB N="7" REF="8"> and the Papi&s;ts and the Iewes goods with vs in <HI>Franckford,</HI> are like to pay for it. The <HI>Mansfieldi|ans</HI> have taken here, the Commi&s;&s;ioner for the Ene|mie, who &s;wagger'd it vp &amp; down in his red skarffe, but the red color is now chang'd to Orengetawney, and none of the <HI>Bavarians</HI> or <HI>Spaniards</HI> heere, dare &s;hew their heads. Neither hath this onely made an impre&s;&s;ion of feare among&s;t vs, but the Citty and Countrey of <HI>Mentz</HI> have taken the affright al&s;o.</P>
<P>And thus, the Country, Citty, Ca&s;tle, and Land|grave of <HI>Derm&s;tadt</HI> being taken, and all ea&s;ily, and all &s;uddenly: The Generall <HI>Mansfield</HI> having intelli|gence, that M. <HI>Tilly</HI> had receiued tho&s;e &s;uccours which he lookt for, being &s;ome 7000. foot and 800. hor&s;e, from <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and that withall the Baron of <HI>Anhalt</HI> with &s;ome 5000. more, of the forces of <HI>Cullen,</HI> was come vp to him, whereby his Army was become 24000. &s;trong at the lea&s;t; and withall fore|ca&s;ting his purpo&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e him&s;elfe of the pa&s;|&s;ages of be&s;t advantage, to hinder them in their re|turne. Hee therefore through his owne, and the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Badens</HI> indi&s;po&s;ition of body to fight (having both beene for &s;ome dayes before, &s;icke of the gowt) was not &s;o willing now, as he hath beene at other times, to fly on, and hazard a battell; where the two Generalls were &s;o much di&s;abled from gi|ving per&s;onall directions: But e&s;pecially hee con&s;i|dered, that he had &s;omething weakned his Army, by putting in of Garri&s;ons into tho&s;e Townes which he had lately taken in; And that the enemie was more in the field then hee; And that new commers
<PB N="8" REF="9"> are &s;till forward to venter and put on at fir&s;t, to get them&s;elues honour and reputation; and he had ra|ther peradventure let their bravery and fury &s;pend it &s;elfe vpon &s;ome light skirmi&s;hes with his Reare, which he well knew they would fall vpon; then to force his owne pa&s;&s;age through the whole and fre&s;h body of their maine Battalion. Therefore there was this cour&s;e agreed vpon; That the Pri&s;es and Pur|cha&s;es, with all the baggage, &amp; luggage of the Army &s;hould be &s;ent home into the Palatinate aforehand, and that the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baden</HI> &s;hould goe before to take the pa&s;&s;age over the river <HI>Mayne</HI> at <HI>Reusburgh</HI> &s;ome Dutch mile and a halfe below <HI>Frankford;</HI> But the towne belonging to the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Derm&s;tadt</HI> and hauing corre&s;ponde~cie with <HI>Tilly,</HI> had a&s;&s;urance from him (vpon their &s;ending to him the newes of <HI>Badens</HI> march thitherward) that hee would withall &s;peed come in to their re&s;cue, if the towne Garri&s;on could but make good the place, &s;ome few houres. So that the towne&s;men beeing confident of &s;uccours, the Marques perceiuing his pa&s;&s;age that way &s;topt; and that all the Army could not pa&s;&s;e the River, be|fore the enemie would bee ready to fall vpon tho&s;e that were pa&s;&s;ing, or not yet pa&s;&s;ed; came off fairely, and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> who kept the Reare with the greate&s;t part of the Army, retired in good order and ley&s;ure, as beeing before freed of their Carriages. And yet neverthele&s;&s;e, the Vauntgard of the <HI>Ba|varians</HI> being come up to the reare of the <HI>Mansfieldi|ans,</HI> followed them, and skirmi&s;hed with them, al|mo&s;t two daies together; In which to confe&s;&s;e the
<PB N="9" REF="9"> truth, and no more but the truth; The Generall in|tending homewards, was vnwilling to turne faces a|bout, and to make a &s;tand with the whole body of his Army, (&s;o at once to receiue the whole &s;hocke of the battell vpon him) there were &s;ome 600. foot, and 60. hor&s;e of ours, cut off; And becau&s;e I would bee impartiall, I haue heere &s;poken with the mo&s;t, although tho&s;e that could wi&s;h them ten times &s;o many, will peraduenture at lea&s;t haue foure times &s;o many &s;laine; &s;o partiall are many reporters, as &s;ome haue not let to giue out, that the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baden</HI> had the defeat of 15000, &amp; the Archduke <HI>Leopol|dus</HI> they would haue to loo&s;e but 400. But beleeue it, as I heare, &s;o I &s;peake nothing vnder the number of common &s;ouldiers heere &s;laine: And of Com|manders, on the Kings &s;ide, one Colonell <HI>Gul&s;tein</HI> of the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Badens</HI> was kild; a Pal&s;graue, and a Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> (of the &s;ame hou&s;e with the Ge|nerall <HI>Mansfield)</HI> are carried hence pri&s;oners; which two great names, will no doubt make a great noy&s;e, being &s;o nere in title to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Pal&s;|graue of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> &amp; to the Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> General of the Army. But to enforme the&s;e men: let them know, that all Princes of the Empire haue this pri|viledge, that their Paternall titles doe de&s;cend to all their younger Sonnes; although to keepe vp the hou&s;e, the Lands are onely entaylde to their elde&s;t. The re&s;t, hauing for their portions, either &s;ome pur|cha&s;ed Lands, or Summes of Moneyes; and with|all the honour of Governour of &s;ome Countrey or State in the Country; which makes them &s;till both
<PB N="10" REF="10"> to bee employed and accounted of: Or el&s;e, they mu&s;t make them&s;elues vp a fortune by the Warres. And thus there are at once diuers Dukes of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> diuers Pal&s;graues of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and diuers Marque&s;|&s;es of <HI>Brandenburgh:</HI> the chiefe of which 3. great Families, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;econd hou&s;es, by the addition of <HI>Kurfur&s;t,</HI> or Elector, put to their &s;tiles: And thus is it po&s;&s;ible (not comparatiuely to in&s;tance in any) that the&s;e two pri&s;oners &s;hould bee no greater per&s;onages, then that Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> whom after the defeat of the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> Colonell <HI>Overtraut</HI> tooke pri&s;oner at <HI>Strasburgh.</HI> On the Enemies party there were many &s;laine too; and among&s;t the re&s;t, one braue hor&s;e captaine, who being hemd in, did with one Cornet of Hor&s;e, aduenture to charge through a whole Regiment of the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Badens</HI> hor&s;e: where being oppre&s;t with multitude, he was killed, ere he could tell his name; &s;ome others are heere pri&s;oners with vs too, men of good fa&s;hion, and the be&s;t forwardnes in the battell: and this skirmi&s;h continued the 29. and 30. of May. The next day the Enemy proud of it to haue had once the better, came on in the heat of blood, and in a brauado pre&s;ented him&s;elfe in Battalia &s;om|times, and &s;ometimes in &s;ome loo&s;e troopes flying vp and downe before the Trenches of the Kings Reare, who had not yet pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Neckar</HI> at <HI>Man|hem</HI> bridge, but were by the River parted from the re&s;t of the Campe. And this they did againe the fir&s;t of <HI>Iune;</HI> but by their actions wee know not whether they be friends or enemies, for they haue attempted
