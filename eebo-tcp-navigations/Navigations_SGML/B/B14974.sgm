What pitty is it in this City, wherein there are &s;o many hor&s;e &amp; footemen rea|ready armed, &amp; &s;end no men out to re&s;cue them, wherby ma|ny poore might be relieued, in re&s;pect that the Hungari|ans are but meane people, and not well armed, and yet are not re&s;i&s;ted, it is &s;trangely di&s;cour&s;t on heere: the hurt they haue done wil not be repaired with the valew of <HI>100</HI> thou&s;and Florens, therefore the common people are de&s;|perate, and neither &s;pare friend nor foe, &s;o al&s;o <HI>2.</HI> dayes &s;ince Bethlem Gabors Hungarians haue made a road in|to Marauia, and &s;poyled all the Country, therefore Colo|nell <HI>Wal&s;tein</HI> with his forces hath left the Marckt, and is forced to goe to Niclae&s;burge: to conclude, they haue &s;hut vp the pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>In the meane time there is a treaty of peace in Hand-hol|den, at Rauen&s;burge, in the Marckt and Committies, to that end on both fides come thether.
