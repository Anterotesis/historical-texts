<P>Although Trecherie / ill Gouvernment of the Souldiers / al&s;o that the Bohemians have not a&s;&s;i&s;ted the King of Bohemia with on accord / and more other matters / are judged to be the movall cau&s;es of the lo&s;&s;e of Praghe / with the appendixes: yet is the chiefe cau&s;uall cau&s;e ac|counted to bee an Indignation of God over the pertickuler rulers therof / for &s;inne / for now tho&s;e Lords and Gentility / which formerly in high degree did u&s;e great Tyranny over their &s;ubiects the &s;ame are now di&s;pi&s;ed of them / for in the Cit|ties they are not &s;uffered / neither dare they com by their Subiects / of whom they are &s;laine.</P>
<P>And in the Sat&s;er Craits are gathered together &s;om certaine <HI>1000.</HI> of Contrymen more / they think to defend them&s;elves by force / if they had but a Gouvernour: and that the King / who having the chiefe Priveledges and Iuwels with him / gathering his forces againe very &s;trongly / hath adverti&s;ed them that hence forth they &s;hould be free: therefore will they a&s;&s;emble many <HI>1000.</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>And although &s;om Counties in Bohemia have given them&s;elves under the Emperours Comi&s;ioner van Wal&s;teen / &s;om being con&s;trai|ned there unto by force / others through threten|ning: as &s;om few dayes agone are arived heere the Emperours Comi&s;ioners / and have pro|pounded / that this Cittie and Countie &s;hould com to the Cittie Laun / and give them&s;elves un|der &s;ubiection / if not / they would per&s;ecute us with fire and &s;word: but they have gotten but a &s;light an&s;wer.

<P>In the meane while is Taus / Mies / Tacha / and other Citties / &s;trongly be&s;et with the Em|perours or Beyers Gari&s;&s;on. The &s;aid Comi|&s;ioners have enterpri&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h Ma&s;-prie&s;ts in certaine places / thereupon the Subiects are very di&s;quieted / and grieved / therefore the Gari&s;|&s;ons are in great danger. The Governour of Taus hath per&s;waded the Lord of Illa (who is Evangeli&s;t) from &s;uch a Reformation / exorting him not to Reforme the fore&s;aid Comi&s;ion of the Emperour / but to punni&s;h the di&s;obediente cal|ling to mind the i&s;&s;ue of the like former Compul|&s;ions. The warres will fir&s;t rightly begin again&s;t the Spring: And there might ari&s;e a ge|neral tumult / for there hath beene an uproer in the oulde Cittie of Prage again&s;t the Sedition of the Souldiers / what the i&s;&s;ue will bee / time can reveale.</P>
