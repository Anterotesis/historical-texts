<HEAD>To the Reader,</HEAD>
<P>COncerning tho&s;e Brief and Nervous Di&s;cour&s;es which are emitted here|with, the Reverend and Worthy Au|thor, had no thoughts of Publi&s;hing them, until &s;uch time as others did Importune him thereunto. As for the fir&s;t Treati&s;e, it was thus occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>In the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time of the late War with the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>N-England,</HI> many of the Rulers (both Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical) in <HI>Connecticut Colony,</HI> being &s;en&s;ible that publick Judgements &s;eldome come, but as Intimations of Heavens di&s;plea|&s;ure; and that then, of all Men the Leaders of the People are concerned to enquire into the Cau&s;es of the Lords Controver&s;ie, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21.1. they did accordingly meet for that purpo&s;e. The Mini&s;ters drew up in writing what they concei|ved to be the mind of God, re&s;pecting the &s;o|lemn Que&s;tion before them; which <HI>Re&s;ult,</HI> was approved of by their Magi&s;trates, and Recom|mended to the Con&s;ideration of the Inhabitants in that Juri&s;diction. This faithful Servant of Chri&s;t, did wifely take hold on that opportunity,
<PB REF="5">in his publick Mini&s;try to in&s;i&s;t upon both the <HI>Malady</HI> and the <HI>Remedy,</HI> which there is &s;o great cau&s;e to be enquiring into, and did reduce his In&s;tructions into a <HI>Catechetical Method,</HI> for the better edification of the younger &s;ort in his Congregation. Sundry Per&s;ons of Worth and Judgement hapning to be pre&s;ent at &s;ome of tho&s;e Exerci&s;es, were very earne&s;t to have them made more publick; to gratifie who&s;e de&s;ires, the Worthy <HI>Author</HI> has been prevailed with to grant the Copy of what was more inlargedly <HI>viva voce,</HI> delivered. A Di&s;cour&s;e of this nature is very &s;ea&s;onable and needful; and I hope will be ble&s;&s;ed for the good of many.</P>
<P>As for the &s;mall tractate, re&s;pecting the <HI>Chri|&s;tian Sabbath;</HI> the Author has (&s;o far as I am able to di&s;cern) with very good judgement and in few words, a&s;&s;erted and proved the Truth who&s;e confirmation he has undertaken. The mo&s;t plau&s;ible Argument, which our <HI>Jewi&s;h Sab|batarians</HI> in&s;i&s;t upon is, their pretending the Mo|rality of the fourth Commandment. Nor do we deny but that by virtue thereof, a <HI>&s;eventh part of time,</HI> or one day in the <HI>Hebdomadel Revolution,</HI> ought to be kept as an holy Re&s;t unto God. But it is evident, that &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Deca|logue,</HI> do in a peculiar manner re&s;pect the <HI>Jewi&s;h State.</HI> This is true of the Preface to the Moral
<PB REF="5">Law; and of the promi&s;e annexed to the fifth Commandment; and &s;ome particulars in the tenth Commandment, are accommodated to the then &s;tate of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> And why &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in the fourth Commandment may not be &s;o too, our &s;eventh day Men have as yet given us no &s;o|lid and &s;ufficient rea&s;on. Nay, the Learned <HI>Jews</HI> them&s;elves acknowledge it to be &s;o. And there|fore they are not offended when they &s;ee Chri|&s;tians doing &s;ervile works upon the &s;eventh day of the week, for they &s;ay the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are not ob|liged to the &s;trict and legal ob&s;ervation of their Sabbath. The Jews in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> told <HI>Jack&s;on, Sands,</HI> and other keepers of the &s;eventh day, that except they were al&s;o Circumci&s;ed, their ob&s;ervation of that day was groundle&s;s. There is no place in the New Te&s;tament which the <HI>Iews</HI> do &s;o much object again&s;t Chri&s;tians as <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.17, 18. They perver&s;ely cavil and &s;ay, that the Apo&s;tles did act contrary to the Do|ctrine of their Ma&s;ter Chri&s;t, by telling Men that they ought not to ob&s;erve the Ceremonial Law, <HI>R. Maimon</HI> (<HI>In mi&s;na</HI> L. 1. C. 9.) has a whole Chapter full of Bla&s;phemy again&s;t tho&s;e who teach that the Law is de&s;troyed in whole or in part. The mo&s;t Judicious and Learned of our Writers, acknowledge that the place mentioned has re&s;pect both to the Ceremonial and to the
<PB REF="6">Moral Law; And that as <GAP DESC="foreign"> is &s;et in opppo&s;ition <GAP DESC="foreign"> as de&s;troying is oppo|&s;ite to fulfilling, chri&s;t did not evert the ceremo|nial Law. he did him&s;elf conform to the cere|monies of the law, and require other men to do &s;o, as long as the author of that law did &s;ee meet to continue it; and every way fulfilled tho&s;e <HI>Types</HI> which pointed at the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that was to come. Our <HI>Iewi&s;h Sabbatarians</HI> who a|bu&s;e tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t to countenance their Error; might as well from thence argue that the Ceremonial Law is &s;till in force. For its certain it was not aboli&s;hed until every tittle contained therein was fulfilled. It has been ob|jected, that Chri&s;tians in the Primitive times ob|&s;erved the &s;eventh day. The Chri&s;tian <HI>Iews</HI> in the Apo&s;tles time had a religious re&s;pect, not only for the &s;eventh day Sabbath, but for Cir|cumci&s;ion and other Ceremonies, until &s;uch time as the <HI>Iudaical World</HI> was utterly de&s;troyed, but the Apo&s;tles never allowed Chri&s;tianized Gen|tiles &s;o to <HI>Iudaize.</HI> The <HI>Ebionites</HI> kept the &s;e|venth day, but they were never accounted true Chri&s;tians. The <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> which pa&s;s under the Name of <HI>Clement,</HI> L 7. C. 24. commend the ob&s;ervation both of the &s;eventh and of the fir&s;t day of the week. And <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> &s;peaks of &s;ome that ob&s;erved both dayes. Such Chri&s;tians
<PB REF="6">were certainly leavened with <HI>Iudai&s;m.</HI> At this day, the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ine</HI> Chri&s;tians ob&s;erve the &s;eventh day, they al&s;o ob&s;erve Circumci&s;ion; and if Men will <HI>Iudaize</HI> in one particular, it is not to to be wondred at, if they be left to <HI>Iudaize</HI> in more. Of later times there have not been ma|ny of any great Fame or Note in the World, that have &s;tood up for this Opinion. There was in <HI>England</HI> formerly <HI>Braborn</HI> and <HI>Trask;</HI> but they afterwards recanted. Within the&s;e few years, Mr. <HI>Bramfield</HI> of <HI>Sherborn</HI> was &s;trangely drawn away into this Error. But his weightie&s;t Objections are an&s;wered, with great judgment and candour, by the Reverend Mr. <HI>William Ben</HI> of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> (a Man who&s;e Conver|&s;ion was occa&s;ioned by a Sermon of his own; after which he continued an eminent Light in the Church of God for fifty years together; and than whom I never knew Man upon Earth that did maintain a greater intimacy of Com|munion with God) Nor has Mr. <HI>Bramfield</HI> made any Reply to Mr. <HI>Ben</HI>'s Book, &s;o far as I have &s;een or heard.</P>
<P>As for the pre&s;ent <HI>Jewi&s;h Sabbatarians</HI> in <HI>Connecticut Colony</HI> they out-do all their Predece&s;&s;ors, as to In&s;olent Behaviour, being arrived unto that height of impudent Prophanene&s;s, that they fear not in the &s;ight of the Sun, to bid defiance unto the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, by following the &s;ervile works of their particular Callings on the Lords Day. So that it was high time for the Magi&s;trate
<PB REF="7">who is <HI>Cu&s;tos utriu&s;&abque; tabulae,</HI> to interpo&s;e. And truly if it had not been &s;o, there is rea&s;on to fear that the hand of Heaven would have done the Magi&s;trates work, after a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ar more terrible manner. We cannot with truth af|firm, that vi&s;ible Judgments from Heaven have befallen Chri&s;tians, for not religiou&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;erving the &s;eventh Day, but Hi&s;tories abound with Examples of Gods awful and tremendous puni&s;hments, inflicted upon the Prophaners of the Lords Day; which is a very convincing Argu|ment, that the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>fir&s;t day of the week</HI> is of Divine In&s;titution.</P>
<P>Concerning the Objector here Animadverted upon; the truth is, his Allegations are feeble and frivolous, &s;o that &s;ome may think 'tis pity a Man of Mr. <HI>Fitch</HI>'s Strength and Ability, &s;hould be improved in a Service which a far meaner hand might with ea&s;e have underta|ken. Yet con&s;idering, that &s;ometimes as &s;en&s;ele&s;s an <HI>Apo&s;tate</HI> as <HI>Mahomet</HI> was, may po&s;&s;ibly leven a World of deluded Souls, if due care be not taken to prevent it; o|thers have judged it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be an&s;wered <GAP DESC="foreign"> What is written will tend either to his Conver&s;ion (which if po&s;&s;ible the Lord grant) or el&s;e to his being left the more inexcu&s;able &amp; condemned in him|&s;elf, while he oppo&s;eth the light of Truth. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> does both allow and require, that &s;ome and in &s;pecial <HI>Ju|daizers</HI> &s;hould be <HI>rebuked &s;harply,</HI> that they may be &s;ound in the faith, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.13. Had the <HI>Antichri&s;tian Sabbatarian</HI> here refuted, only mode&s;tly &s;crupled whether the &s;eventh day were not &s;till of Divine in&s;titution, more gentlene&s;s in Expre&s;&s;ion would have been u&s;ed with him; but he is not a per&s;on to be <HI>Saved</HI> in that way. If by any means he be plucked out of the fire, neither him&s;elf, nor tho&s;e that have aimed at his Salvation, will be &s;orry, <HI>Jude</HI> 23. The Lord give a ble&s;&s;ing to Faithful Endeavours, and vin|dicate his Truth, Name, and Sabbath, in &s;uch a way as &s;hall be mo&s;t for his own Glory.</P>

<HEAD>In Order to &s;ome <HI>Explica|tion</HI> of the Solemn Advice, which our Honoured Magi&s;trates did in the Time of our Calamity, &s;end abroad unto the &s;everal Churches and Congregations in this Colony, we have occa&s;ion to reflect upon both</HEAD>
<P>THe Provocations of <HI>New-England,</HI> and the Impediments of Refor|mation; and to make way for the following Di&s;cour&s;e: we may con&s;ider what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that great Prophet of the Lord, and chief Ruler in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did incul|cate upon that People in <HI>Deut.</HI> 9.7. <HI>Remem|ber, and forget not how thou provoked&s;t the Lord thy God to wrath in the Wilderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We ought to have and hold a remembrance what our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been, by which the Lord hath been provoked to wrath a|gain&s;t us.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Remembrance ought to be clear and full: the Pen-men of the Holy Scriptures
<PB N="2" REF="8">were moved by the Spirit of God, to Record clearly and fully the Provocations of which the People of God had been guilty, as is ma|nife&s;t in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78. <HI>&amp; P&s;al.</HI> 106. and through the Hi&s;tory of the Church in the Book of God, and &s;ome of the &s;pots of the mo&s;t beautiful Saints, God would not &s;uffer the&s;e to be for|gotten and left out of the Holy Scripture Re|cord, 1 <HI>King</HI> 15.5. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 106.32, 32.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Remembrance ought to be affecti|onate, with a heart &s;uitably affected; Remem|bring what our cares and fears, grief and tears were in that day, when the wrath of the Lord appeared to be a con&s;uming fire, and we as combu&s;tible matter; and had not the Lord quenched the fire of his wrath, with his own Bowels of Mercies, we had peri&s;hed, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16 61. <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.19, 20.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Remembrance ought to be parti|cularly Reforming, con&s;idering how our &s;ins have driven us into a perillous &s;tate, and we ready to peri&s;h in the Ocean of mi&s;eries, and &s;hall we again provoke the Lord to wrath? will he not be angry until he hath con&s;umed us? <HI>Ezra</HI> 9.14. if we do not remember our Provocations to our Humiliation and Refor|mation, the Lord will remember them again&s;t us, to our own confu&s;ion and de&s;truction; al|though
<PB N="3" REF="8">we wa&s;h our &s;elves as with Nitre, and take much Sope, yet our iniquities are marked before the Lord, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.22. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.21, 22.</P>
<P>And we may &s;ee what Record of Provi|dences re&s;pecting a People or particular per|&s;ons is mo&s;t agreeable to holy Scripture Rule. That Record which doth declare the Righte|ous acts of the Lord &amp; our unrighteous deeds, the &s;uperabounding Grace of God although our &s;ins have abounded: That Record which doth &s;et forth the Lords Ju&s;tice, Mercy, Truth, Faithfulne&s;s and Almighty arm, by uncovering the feeblene&s;s, &s;icklene&s;s, fal&s;ene&s;s, &amp; many o|ther bitter Provocations, both of Rulers &amp; peo|ple, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.7, 8. This is mo&s;t like the Record in Holy Scripture, and the Church Hi&s;tory therein contained: but &s;uch a faithful Record &s;eldom comes forth in that age in which the then pre&s;ent Providences were acted, few will &s;uffer a plain Remembrance of their Provo|cations, but the Lord hath hitherto provided &s;ome faithful Recorder, who hath left that in Record to &s;ucceeding Ages, which the pre&s;ent Generation would not endure to hear of, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 10.4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.5. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.36, 37, 38.</P>
<P>And that we may have and hold a convin|cing, hearty &amp; Reforming effectual Remem|brance what our Provocations have been; let
<PB N="4" REF="9">us con&s;ider according to that mo&s;t Solemn Advice of our Rulers.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What that &s;in is which is the root actually and nextly of all the other &s;ins?</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> Apo&s;ta&s;ie from the true Religion, con|&s;idered not only ab&s;olutely but comparatively as it is a declen&s;ion from the &s;tricter part of Religion, or a decay of the Beauty of a Re|ligious Profe&s;&s;ion, and this Apo&s;tacy doth &s;hew it &s;elf in the various degrees of it, and in the bitter fruits and effects of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="1">1. Apo&s;ta&s;ie may be taken either Ab&s;olute|ly, or Comparatively. 1. Ab&s;olutely, and &s;o its a total turning from the Faith, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.19, 20. and thus the Apo&s;tate is become a Bla&s;pheming Infidel; or a falling from Profe&s;&s;i|on to Prophanene&s;s; &amp; thus the Apo&s;tate is turn+ed like the Dog to his Vomit, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.22, or a for&s;aking all Godline&s;s, and godly wayes, and loving the pre&s;ent World; and thus the A|po&s;tate is become a meer Worldling, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or Apo&s;ta&s;ie taken Comparatively.</P>
<P N="1">1. In compari&s;on of that which the&s;e Pro|fe&s;&s;ors have been and done, and thus they are not the lovers of God, and doers of good works, which &s;ometimes formerly they have been, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.4 5.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<P N="2">2. Fallen away in compari&s;on of the ex|amples of their godly Predece&s;&s;ors, who&s;e Children they are after the Fle&s;h, but not after the Spirit, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.37.44. a noble Vine, and right Seed in re&s;pect of their Parentage, but a degenerate Plant in re&s;pect of their own practice, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.21. and have gone away from the Ordinances of the Lord, from the dayes of their Fathers, and not kept them in that purity and power, as they were left with them by their Predece&s;&s;ors, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.7.</P>
<P N="3">3. In compari&s;on of what they yet profe&s;s in words to be, but compare their words, and their works, and it is manife&s;t that their works do deny what in words they profe&s;s, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.16 concerning that ab&s;olute Apo&s;ta&s;ie, it is not &s;een in many in <HI>New-England,</HI> nor u&s;ually &s;een in any, unle&s;s it be in &s;ome who at fir&s;t are left to Doctrinal Prophanene&s;s, by falling into damnable Here&s;ies, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.1. and are after|wards given up to practical Prophanene&s;s, Infi|delity and Athei&s;m: But as to this compara|tive and gradual Apo&s;ta&s;ie, how far <HI>New-En|gland</HI> is declined from being <HI>New-England,</HI> I mu&s;t leave to the wi&s;e hearted to judge, and tho&s;e only are be&s;t able to judge of this, who are kept in an awakened broken-hearted, and humbly-believing frame, by frequent heart-&s;earching
<PB N="6" REF="10">and &s;elf-emptying tryals.</P>
<P>And this comparative Apo&s;ta&s;ie doth appear.</P>
<P N="1">1. In Declen&s;ion from the &s;tricter part of Religion: an apo&s;tatizing Profe&s;&s;or in his con&s;ultations and contrivements, will chu&s;e the licencing part of that in&s;truction given by Chri&s;t, to be wi&s;e as Serpents, but he refu&s;eth that re&s;trictive part to be harmle&s;s as Doves, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.16. but happy is he who is harmle&s;ly wi&s;e, and yet wi&s;ely harmle&s;s. An Apo&s;tati|zing Church is inten&s;ely &s;et to the exten&s;ion of Church Liberties to the utmo&s;t extremity of them, that is the licencing part, but will be remi&s;s in the exerci&s;e of Church Di&s;cipline, and to keep the difference clear between the clean and the unclean, that is the &s;tricter part of Religion, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 22.26. An Apo&s;tatizing Profe&s;&s;or will catch at Chri&s;tian Liberty to plea&s;e the fle&s;h, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.13. but will not &s;it as with a knife at his Throat, as the wi&s;dome of the Spirit of God doth warn in that matter him who is given to appetite, or any &s;en&s;ual affection; this is the &s;tricter part of Religion, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.2. A withering Profe&s;&s;or in the mid&s;t of all his Apo&s;tatizing and degenerate Practi&s;es wanteth not wit, nor will, zeal nor courage, to do &s;ome duties in which he can
<PB N="7" REF="10">pacifie Con&s;cience and plea&s;e corruption, can honour God and exalt him&s;elf, and be as <HI>E|phraim,</HI> like the Heifer that loveth to tread out the Corn, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 10.11. But as to tho&s;e Du|ties in which there mu&s;t be a crucifying of the fle&s;h and the affections, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.24. and an an|nihilating the idol &s;elf, and that the ca&s;ting a|way &s;elf, &s;hall be the way to &s;ave him&s;elf, and the hating of life &s;hall be the only way to keep it to life eternal. <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.25. whatever a be|lieving Con&s;cience may tell an Apo&s;tatizing Profe&s;&s;or of the truth of the&s;e things, yet an unbelieving and backfliding heart will draw back, for he loveth plea&s;ures more than to plea&s;e God, and the prai&s;e of Men more than the prai&s;e of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.42, 43. and thus the declen&s;ion is from the &s;tricter part of Reli|gion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or a decay of the beauty of a religious Profe&s;&s;ion, and this is u&s;ually &s;een:</P>
<P N="1">1. Either in a palpable neglect of &s;ome known duty, in which it may be &s;aid of him, <HI>thou lacke&s;t one thing,</HI> Mark 10.21. and is as the deficiency or want of &s;ome part and mem|ber in the body which marreth the integrity and compleatne&s;s of the Man.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or &s;ome notorious di&s;ordering and di&s;|placing of duties, that one &s;ervice comes in
<PB N="8" REF="11">the time and place of another, and not do|ing that which is comely, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.35. and this is as a member of the Body out of its proper place, and a want of that beautiful and joyful thing called Order, <HI>Col.</HI> 2, 5.</P>

<P N="4">4.

But a declining Profe&s;&s;or is either in|di&s;creetly zealous, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.2. or luke warm, neither hot nor cold, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.16. he is either Schi&s;matically cen&s;orious, and &s;aith, <HI>Stand by, I am holier than you, I&s;ai.</HI> 65.5. or is &s;o promi&s;|cuou&s;ly temporizing, that he is mixed among the People, and as a Cake not turned, <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> 7.8.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of this is, that the Lord in judgement doth withhold from Apo&s;tatizing
<PB N="9" REF="11">Profe&s;&s;ors, tho&s;e beautiful vi&s;ions, and tran&s;|forming Di&s;coveries of his Glory, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. he doth withdraw the ri&s;ing Beams of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the &s;hadows of the Evening are &s;tretched upon them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.4 5. and the temptations of Satan, and the World doth look upon them, and make them Sun|burnt, and Black, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.6. and the Beauty of their vi&s;ible Profe&s;&s;ion, doth langui&s;h as with pining &s;ickne&s;s, their love decayeth and waxeth cold, and iniquity aboundeth, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.12. and if there yet remain &s;ome good things with an Apo&s;tatizing People, <HI>yet how is the Gold become dim,</HI> Lam. 4.1. their Profe&s;&s;ion hath lo&s;t much of that golden &s;plendor and precious and plea&s;ant lu&s;tre. And thus Apo|&s;tacy con&s;idered as a decay of the beauty of a religious Profe&s;&s;ion, and this maketh way for the clearing of the Rea&s;on, why Apo&s;ta&s;ie is the root of other &s;ins; and that is,</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e other &s;ins in nature follow this, and they are as branches or bitter fruits: the &s;in of omi&s;&s;ion, is in nature before the &s;in of commi&s;&s;ion; a neglect of what ought to be done, before the practice of that which ought not to be done; a for&s;aking the Fountain of living Waters, and then follows, <HI>our hewing Ci&s;terns, broken Ci&s;terns which can hold no Wa|ter,</HI> Jer. 2.13.</P>

<P N="2">2. The other &s;ins are (through the Lords ju&s;t judgement) a puni&s;hment of the former.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Apo&s;ta&s;ie doth &s;hew it &s;elf in the neg|lect of &s;everal Duties of Gods Wor&s;hip, or of Family Duties, or private Chri&s;tian Meet|ings, and at la&s;t in the neglect of the Publick Wor&s;hip of God.</P>

But the &s;pecialty intended in the hand|ling of this, is to &s;hew how far the neglect of the&s;e &s;ecret Duties doth argue a declen&s;ion from Religion.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e who neglect &s;ecret Duties have

<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e who neglect the&s;e &s;ecret Duties, have lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal, inward Soul-difficulties; for who&s;oever feels in a broken-hearted manner, his Soul pinched and pre&s;s'd with difficulties, he mu&s;t and will have an out|let by &s;ecret Prayer, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.11. <HI>Behold he Prayeth,</HI> he embraceth Prayer not only as a duty, but as a gracious liberty; but among&s;t his Soul difficulties, he ever finds &s;ome which cannot be &s;o particularly and expediently reached but by &s;ecret Prayer, and calleth for a praying apart, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.14. but tho&s;e who neglect the&s;e &s;ecret duties are pa&s;t feeling of the&s;e difficulties, and as they feel no &s;uch need of &s;ecret prayer, &s;o Chri&s;t pa&s;&s;eth by them, as

<P N="3">3. The&s;e have lo&s;t the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in &s;ecret; and as they have for&s;aken him in &s;ecret, &s;o he will for&s;ake them openly. There are many are very de&s;irous to hold the pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t openly, although they neglect his pre&s;ence in &s;ecret, but this cannot be, they have no promi&s;e and grounded hope of his pre&s;ence openly, who do neglect the means of his pre&s;ence in &s;ecret, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.5.

<P N="2">2. A neglect of Family Duties; as Prayer in the Family morning and evening, and are of the number of tho&s;e Families which do not call upon the Name of God, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.25. or neglect reading the Word of God daily in the Family, or occa&s;ional repeating of Ser|mons, or of that daily in&s;tructing the Family

<P N="1">1. Either total and are under the &s;ame &s;entence of wrath with the Heathen, and are heatheni&s;h Families, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or tho&s;e who are incon&s;tant in the&s;e Du|ties if prayer in the evening, yet none in the morning, or if prayer, yet have &s;trangely for|got that by Word and Prayer all is &s;anctified, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.5. but the &s;pecialty I intend in this is not &s;o much to prove the&s;e to be duties, for who knoweth not this, who knoweth any thing of the Word of God, and of the practice of godly Families; but let us con&s;ider how far a neglect of the&s;e doth argue Apo&s;tacy from Religion.</P>
<P N="1">1. The&s;e want true &s;anctified love to their Families; the natural love doth incline them to take care and provide for their Families in things of concernment to the outward Man, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.8. Otherwi&s;e they are wor&s;e than an Infidel, and if they had true &s;anctified love to their families, this would make them as readily to take care for their Families in their Soul concernments, and <HI>Abraham</HI>-like as a head of the Family, to in&s;truct, yea command an attendance to the great things of God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.19. but the&s;e want natural affection truly &s;anctified.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P N="2">2. The&s;e want love to God, and to their own Souls.</P>
<P N="1">1. They want love to God, for this would di&s;po&s;e them to a through care to bring up their Family in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. They want love to their own Souls, its not po&s;&s;ible for one to pitty his own Soul, but pre&s;ently he will pitty and take care of the Souls of others, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who are nearly related to him: if a Ma&s;ter of a Fa|mily be under a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, and a Bo|wel melting working of a Spirit of love to his own Soul, <HI>Ephraim</HI>-like to bemoan him&s;elf, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18. he will then need no other motive to make him pray in his Family, In&s;truct, Cate|chi&s;e, and u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means for the good of his Family.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e want true love to Church and Common-wealth; they cannot but know that &s;uch as Families are, &s;uch at la&s;t the Church and Common-wealth mu&s;t be. How can it be that a Ma&s;ter of Family, who liveth in neglect of Family Duties, &s;hould prove a true Friend to the purity and power of Religion in Church, or to a true pious Government in the Common wealth? he that will not &s;erve God in his own Hou&s;e, will not be a true Ser|vant
<PB N="16" REF="15">of God in the hou&s;e of the Lord, nor in the Common wealth, let us view well <HI>Jo&s;huah</HI>'s &s;peech and practice, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 24.15. and what <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 101.2.</P>
<P>The third Particular followeth, and that is a neglect of private Chri&s;tian Meetings.</P>
<P N="1">1. As tho&s;e &s;et and &s;olemn Meetings for Conference about the great things of God, and to pray together, and &s;ometimes adding Fa&s;ting and Prayer.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or tho&s;e occa&s;ional Meetings of Chri|&s;tians, taking opportunities as they have oc|ca&s;ions one with another, to conver&s;e about their Soul concerns.</P>
<P>And the neglect of the&s;e is either 1. Total; there are &s;ome who have wholly for&s;aken the&s;e A&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves together: or 2. If they hold up &s;ome &s;et Meetings; yet as to tho&s;e intimate Di&s;cour&s;es, by laying toge|ther their Ob&s;ervations of the times, and o|ther Soul-concerns, as tho&s;e Jewels &s;poken of in <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.16. from the&s;e they are Strangers, and will give no heart-encouragement to other Chri&s;tians to come near to them, with intimate Conference about per&s;onal and par|ticular Experiences of the Lords dealing with them; and the&s;e know not what it meaneth to come into that broken hearted way of ac|knowledging
<PB N="17" REF="15">one to another, their temptati|ons &s;nares, and Soul-hazards, and that which is called by the Apo&s;tle a confe&s;&s;ing of Faults one to another, and a praying one for another, <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.16.</P>
<P>But the &s;pecialty likewi&s;e we intend in this, is to &s;hew how far the&s;e neglects do argue de|clen&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. The&s;e neglect a principal means of pra|ctical communion of Chri&s;tians, that wherein much of the life of it doth con&s;i&s;t; for pra|ctical Chri&s;tian Communion cannot principal|ly con&s;i&s;t in Apellations, and Titles, nor in meeting together at a Sacrament; but in caring one for another, as members of the &s;ame body, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.25. bearing one ano|thers Burdens, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.2. communicating one to another of &s;piritual gifts, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.11, 12. but tho&s;e &s;olemn Chri&s;tian Meetings or occa|&s;ional intimate Di&s;cour&s;es, whereby Chri&s;tians are intimately acquainted with one anothers Burdens, and Soul-concerns; the&s;e lead into the life of practical communion, and where the&s;e Chri&s;tian Meetings fail, their communion vani&s;heth into Names, Titles, or &s;ome very powerle&s;s forms of communion.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e do give place to many dangerous Temptations and di&s;tempers; for while they
<PB N="18" REF="16">live as Strangers from the Souls one of ano|ther, or any &s;uch intimate Chri&s;tian Confe|rences; the Tempter is at hand upon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion, to come in with uncharitable &s;ugge|&s;tions, and to imploy any evil In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rument to &s;ow &s;eeds of di&s;cord among&s;t Chri&s;tians, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.20. and when the&s;e come to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ords Supper, the Go&s;pel Pa&s;&s;eover, if they be not pa&s;t &s;eeling, they will find it too hard for them to eat with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.8. with that true Go&s;pel &s;pirit of unity as becometh tho&s;e who eat of the &s;ame &s;piritual Bread, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.16. yea its u&s;ually &s;een (through the Lords ju&s;t judgement) that tho&s;e who are become Strangers from Chri&s;tian Meetings, or the hearty way of the management of them, that they are left to too much familiarity with other Companions to the reproach of their Profe&s;&s;ion, and harm to their own Souls, and at la&s;t the wrath of God comes and finds them in fellow&s;hip with Children of Di&s;obedience in &s;ome works of darkne&s;s, which they ought to have reproved, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.11.</P>
<P>The next Con&s;ideration follows:</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>How Apo&s;ta&s;ie doth &s;hew it &s;elf in the neglect of publick Wor&s;hip?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>An&s;wer</HI> is, In neglect either of tho&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="16">Ordinances which all are commanded to at|tend, as publick Prayer, and hearing the Word of God Preached, and particularly of Sanctifying the Sabbath; Or a neglect of tho&s;e Ordinances which do properly belong to tho&s;e in Church Relation, and particularly in neglect of the Lords Supper and Church Di&s;|cipline.</P>
<P N="1">1. A neglect of tho&s;e publick Ordinances which all are commanded to attend, as pub|lick Prayer, and hearing the Word preached, and this neglect is, either.</P>
<P N="1">1. Upon &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, not works of Mercy, as <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.13. but from an unwillingne&s;s to break throng any con&s;idera|ble difficulty, or to beat co&s;t about publick Wor&s;hip not as <HI>David,</HI> who would not offer that to the Lord which co&s;t nothing. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or not careful to come &s;ea&s;onably to the publick Wor&s;hip, as before the fir&s;t Pray|er, or entrance be made into the publick Wor|&s;hip; in the&s;e they are carele&s;s, not as tho&s;e in <HI>Nehemiah</HI>'s time, who were &s;ea&s;onably ready, and waited for the publick Wor&s;hip of God, <HI>Neh.</HI> 8.1.</P>
<P N="3">3. Or attending upon the Ordinances in a &s;lighty and &s;leepy manner, not offering their

More particularly this neglect doth &s;hew it &s;elf and Apo&s;ta&s;ie therein, in the neglect of Sanctifying the Sabbath; and that is either,</P>
<P N="1">1. In neglecting to prepare for the Sab|bath by a timely breaking off from worldly Occa&s;ions, but do run on to the very time of the beginning of the Sabbath, to that in their Worldly concerns, their foot &s;teppeth into the time of the Sabbath, or &s;o nigh to it that they cannot prepare for holy time, and the Duties of the &s;ame &s;o &s;uddenly, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 58.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or in the time of the Sabbath, a neglect to Sanctifie the Holy time, having forgot to practice that which is &s;o plainly declared: Call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, and honourable, and &s;halt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, not finding thine own plea&s;ure, not &s;peaking thine own words, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 58.13.</P>
<P N="3">3. As &s;oon as the Sabbath is ended, tho&s;e who do fall into vain and unprofitable di&s;cour|&s;es,
<PB N="21" REF="17">which at all times are &s;inful, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 5.4. but in a Sabbath Evening are the Soul robbing temptations, by which Satan does bereave them of all the good they have &s;een or heard of God in the holy Day, or are running into their worldly Di&s;cour&s;es, as if they were glad the Sabbath were ended, <HI>Ames</HI> 8.5.</P>
<P>But let us likewi&s;e in this con&s;ider how far the&s;e neglects do argue a declen&s;ion from Re|ligion.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. The&s;e do by their practice &s;ay, that the wor&s;hip of God is a burden, and an abhorring to them, their loathne&s;s to come to the pub|lick Wor&s;hip, their weari&s;ome Behaviour in the time of it, and their ha&s;tening from it do

<PB N="61" REF="37">Lord be angry until he hath con&s;umed us <HI>Ezra</HI> 9.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. But publick Reformation mu&s;t be carri|ed on principally by tho&s;e who are in publick place; the Rulers of the Common-wealth holding and handling the Sword of Ju&s;tice imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rtially, and brightly, to the terror of evil doers, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.3. executing judgement in the Gates, and &s;eeking truth, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.1.

<P N="3">3. But if every one do not practically a|gree to carry on according to their places and power, their part, the whole work of Reformation will be ob&s;tructed in &s;ome de|gree or other.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who are in chief place, and have the greate&s;t Power, &s;hall leave the greate&s;t Burden of the work upon the &s;houlders of tho&s;e who are in inferiour places, and power, the&s;e will &s;ink under the burden or mi&s;carry in

<P N="5">5. Or whatever the care and pains may be of Reformers in faithfulne&s;s to God, and to his People, yet when they &s;pend their Labour upon a People who are under the power of judicial impenitency:</P>
<P N="1">1. Their labour will be in vain at pre&s;ent as to the work of Reformation; if that peo|ple had <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to be their Ruler, yet they will be &s;tiff necked, and be corrupting them&s;elves, and one another, and be an unreformed and unreforming People, again&s;t whom the Lord had Sworn in his wrath they &s;hould never en|ter into his re&s;t, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.30.

<P N="2">2. And yet this is &s;ometimes the heavy work of Pious Rulers, thus to labour in the

<P N="3">3. And yet the harder the work of Refor|mers is, and they found faithful in it, though labouring with a People under a judicial im|penitency, and it is in vain as to that people: but yet their work proveth the more accepta|ble to God, and they &s;hall be the more glo|rious in the eyes of the Lord, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 49.4, 5. 2 Cor. 12.15. and tho&s;e Rulers are in the way to &s;ee peace and truth in their dayes, as <HI>Heze|kiah, Jo&s;iah,</HI> and other godly Rulers had this favour graunted to them; although their

<P N="4">4.

<P>ARguments Grounded upon the Word of God, to prove that the Fir&s;t Day of the Week is by Di|vine Appointment the Day &s;epara|ted for Holy Wor&s;hip, and ought to be kept Holy unto the Lord, according to the Rules of Sanctifying the Sabbath, and con&s;equently the Ce&s;&s;ation of the &s;eventh Day Sabbath in the&s;e Go&s;pel Dayes.</P>
<P>And then a Reply to <HI>John Rogers</HI> his An|&s;wers to &s;ome Que&s;tions &s;ent to him from the Honourable Governour of <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and likewi&s;e an An&s;wer to <HI>John R.</HI> his &s;even Que|&s;tions with which he concluded.</P>
<P>Concerning the Arguments, the Que&s;tion is not now concerning the Name, whether to be called a Chri&s;tian Sabbath, which &s;ome take to be Analogically a re&s;emblance to the <HI>Jewi&s;h Sabbath;</HI> or whither to be called the Lords Day, which &s;ome have thought to be a
<PB N="76" REF="45">more Go&s;pel Name. But the Subject of our Di&s;cour&s;e at this time, is not concerning the Name but the thing, and far be it from me to imagine that I can add any thing to, or do &s;o well as tho&s;e Worthies, Doctor <HI>Bound,</HI> Mr. <HI>Abbot,</HI> Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> &amp; Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> and others have done in their Learned Ela|borate Di&s;cour&s;es upon this Subject, only I &s;hall take &s;ome Arguments which to me &s;eem mo&s;t &s;uitable to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is from <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.10. in which the Apo&s;tle declared, <HI>that he was in the Spirit on the Lords Day:</HI> For the opening of which words to make way for the Argument we may Con&s;ider:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It was &s;ome particular Day in the week, which the Apo&s;tle calls the Lords Day: for his Scope is to notifie at what particular time he had the Vi&s;ions and Revelations of &s;o great concernment to all the Churches in all Ages to the end of the World, and this he cal|leth the Lords Day:</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> Which was either &s;ome particular day, or &s;ome general name applicable to any day of divine Vi&s;ion, if &s;o then the an&s;wer &s;hould be the &s;ame with the Que&s;tion, and prove and make evident nothing, for the que&s;tion is what day he had the&s;e divine vi&s;ions
<PB N="77" REF="45">and the An&s;wer then &s;hould be in the day of divine Vi&s;ions, far be it from us to think that the Apo&s;tle guided by the Spirit of God in every word he &s;aid, could &s;peak &s;uch non&s;ence: therefore it mu&s;t be under&s;tood of &s;ome par|ticular day in the week.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It was &s;ome particular Day well known to the Churches of Chri&s;t to whom he wrote, by that name of the Lords Day.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> For it was a Day well known to the Churches by the name of the Lords Day, or el&s;e unknown and ob&s;cure, and would want an Expo&s;ition; far be it likewi&s;e from us to think that the Apo&s;tle guided by the Spirit of God, and having undertaken to make known to the Churches in what particular Day he had tho&s;e Divine Revelations, &s;hould put an ob&s;cure and unknown name upon the Day by which the Churches could not know what he meant; therefore it is to be under&s;tood of a particular day well known to the Churches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> This particular Day &s;o well known to the Churches by the name of the Lords Day, was a Day of divine In&s;titution a Holy Day:</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> For it is called the Lords Day, either becau&s;e it was a day of divine Revelation, or a
<PB N="78" REF="46">Day by divine In&s;titution; but it was not cal|led the Lords Day, becau&s;e it was a day of divine Revelation, for as we heard before, this would be to &s;peak non&s;en&s;e, and nothing to the Que&s;tion, therefore it was called the Lords Day, becau&s;e it was &s;o by divine In&s;titution, and &s;o a Holy Day.</P>
<P>Take one <HI>Argument</HI> more for the clearing of this, That which is honoured by the Holy Gho&s;t in the Apo&s;tle, with the &s;ame honou|rable and holy Title and Name as belongs to the Lords Supper, and other holy In&s;titutions is holy as the&s;e are.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> The rea&s;on is, for if the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould honour this particular Day with as &s;a|cred a Name of Honour, as Ordinances are, and yet not be a holy Day, it would be to ho|nour it above its due, and con&s;equently to degrade other divine In&s;titutions, but this can|not be, but the day &s;poken of hath the &s;ame honourable title and name, as the Lords Sup|per, the Word of the Lord. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That the particular Day well known to the Churches of Chri&s;t, called by the &s;ame honourable and holy Title or Name, as the Lords Supper is, and other holy In&s;titutions was the fir&s;t day of the week.</P>
<P>And for the Proof of this, let us con&s;ider
<PB N="79" REF="46">Arguments of all &s;orts, inartificial, and arti|ficial abundantly confirmed by the Holy Scri|ptures, Light and Evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To begin with inartificial Arguments, <HI>viz.</HI> Te&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of all the Churches in all ages, from the Apo&s;tles times, until you come nigh to our dayes; take Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s own words, <HI>It is unque&s;tionable to any man ver&s;ed in antiquity, that all the Churches of Chri&s;t, Greek and Latin, Syrian, Ethiopick, Per&s;ian, and Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ck called the fir&s;t day of the week the Lords Day:</HI> and further he and other Wor|thies have and do give the chalenge unto any one to cite out of approved Hi&s;tories, or from but one an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ent Writer, but one Church, or but one Chri&s;tian or but one Heretick, who did gain&s;ay this but of late times. And what force there is in this Argument we may now weigh it; the Word of God &s;aith, <HI>that the Te&s;timony of two Men is true,</HI> John 8.17. this is granted of all who have but humanity, that it is legally true, and the contrary to this is legally fal&s;e, and we may know what to judge of him that &s;peaks it: but the Te&s;timony of all the Churches of Chri&s;t, from the Apo&s;tles time from age to age, may well have the cre|dit which belongs to two men, and &s;omewhat more, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that it was not
<PB N="80" REF="47">po&s;&s;ible all the Churches Ea&s;t and We&s;t, tho&s;e who had no opportunity one with another, that the&s;e could convene or any wayes con&s;ult to deceive their poor po&s;terity with a lie, by telling them that the fir&s;t day of the week had the holy name of the Lords day, and was to be kept holy, when if it were fal&s;e: but they all &s;pake the &s;ame thing, becau&s;e they were guided according to truth, which came from the &s;ame &s;pirit of truth, breathing in the Apo&s;tles, and guiding the Churches in the primitive time, to declare the &s;ame to their Children, and &s;o to Childrens Children in all ages, according as it was &s;aid in another ca&s;e, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.6, 7. and if <HI>de facto</HI> as they call it, concerning the fact, for that we now &s;peak of <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the fir&s;t day of the week from the primitive time, was called the Lords day, if Hi&s;tories be of no u&s;e to inform us, or what they &s;ay ought not to be credited, although they generally &s;peak the &s;ame thing as to fact what was done, I know not of what u&s;e they be: but all the Books and Hi&s;tories of the Church of Chri&s;t concerning the time of the ten Per&s;ecutions, and ever &s;ince, may be com|mitted to the Flames as unworthy of credit: and let us never Write and Record any thing more for the benefit of Po&s;terity of this kind:
<PB N="81" REF="47">But I take it for granted that no &s;ober minded Chri&s;tian will agree to this whatever <HI>John Ro|gers</HI> his judgement may be.</P>
<P>And if any do de&s;ire to &s;ee more fully how it is proved that the fir&s;t day of the week is the Lords day by the te&s;timony of the antient Wri|ters; let them read Mr. <HI>Samuel Cradock</HI>'s Book Entituled <HI>Knowledge and Practice,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s Book, concerning the <HI>fir&s;t Day of the week by Divine Appointment the Lords Day;</HI> in which Books may be &s;een the antient Writers cited in their &s;everal places and ages from the primitive time to the latter time, at|te&s;ting the fir&s;t day of the week to be the Lords Day.</P>
<P>We have at pre&s;ent done with the fir&s;t Ar|gument, as it re&s;pects Te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="2">2. But let us proceed to that kind of Argu|ment which by the Learned is called Artificial, and argues from the Artifice, Frame and Na|ture of the thing, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be granted to be the &s;tronge&s;t way of Rea&s;on|ing.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> The Apo&s;tle calls the Day as it was by the Lord made, and as it is, or el&s;e he did mi&s;cal it; the fir&s;t part of this disjunct Pro|po&s;ition mu&s;t be granted, that the Apo&s;tle did call the Day as it is, as the Lord had made,
<PB N="82" REF="48">for none will dare to &s;ay that he mi&s;called it, unle&s;s it be tho&s;e who have learned to Bla&s;|pheme. The Minor follows, that the fir&s;t day of the Week was made by the Lord above any other day of the week to be the Lords Day in Go&s;pel times; and for the Proof of this let us now Con&s;ider:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> this was the day in which our Lord ro&s;e, <HI>John</HI> 20.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Luk.</HI> 24.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. This was the day in which he appeared to the two Di&s;ciples after his Re&s;urrection to teach them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 24.13.</P>
<P N="3">3. This was the day in which he appeared to the Apo&s;tles, and gave them their Commi&s;|&s;ion, and the Holy Gho&s;t to enable them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 24.33, 36. <HI>John</HI> 20.19, 20, 21, 22.</P>
<P N="4">4. And this was the day he cho&s;e again to ap|pear, when <HI>Thomas</HI> was with them, <HI>John</HI> 20.26.</P>
<P N="5">5. And this was the day promi&s;ed and pro|phe&s;ied of and &s;ulfilled as in the former par|ticulars.</P>
<P>It was the day promi&s;ed in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 118.24. called the day the Lord hath made: &s;peaking by way of Promi&s;e and Prophecie of Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection Day, as it is expre&s;s in the words.</P>
<P>And that which &s;ome have mentioned in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 43.27. hath likewi&s;e its weight, that
<PB N="83" REF="48">the eighth day &s;hall be the day wherein their Offering &s;hall be accepted.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> Take the Argument from hence, ei|ther this was performed literally, or typically, if literally, then the eighth day which is our fir&s;t day of the week, was Honoured and San|ctified above the &s;eventh day, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the Lords appointment: but thus it was not be|fore the Go&s;pel times for that would be con|trary to <HI>Numb.</HI> 28.9, 10. therefore, it is to be under&s;tood typically, <HI>viz.</HI> what day in Go&s;pel times the Wor&s;hip of God, &s;hall be accepta|ble, and that is the eight day which is our fir&s;t day of the week.</P>
<P>And that day of his Re&s;urrection was the day of performing that great promi&s;e and prophecie, <HI>Thou art my Son, this day I have be|gotten thee,</HI> for thus its expounded by the A|po&s;te, <HI>Act.</HI> 13.33. God hath fulfilled the &s;ame to us, in that he hath rai&s;ed up Je&s;us again, as it is written in the &s;econd <HI>P&s;alm, Thou art my Son this day I have begotten thee.</HI></P>
<P>For although Chri&s;t is the Son of God from everla&s;ting, yet this was the day in which he was declared to be the Son of God by Re&s;ur|rection from the dead, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.4. and the fir&s;t day of the week was the very day for the per|formance of this promi&s;e, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.5. as <HI>Pareus</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="49">doth more fully explain it.</P>
<P>And to conclude this, and though we can|not expect that tho&s;e who are under a penal blindne&s;s and deafne&s;s, will either give or take rea&s;on until the Lord &s;hall give them an ear to hear, and an eye to &s;ee, and becau&s;e they &s;ay they &s;ee their &s;in remaineth, <HI>John</HI> 9 41. Bot to help the mind and memory of tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible of their weakne&s;s, but are willing to hear and &s;ee: Let us gather up briefly that which hath been &s;aid out of <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.10. as followeth;</P>
<P>The day called the <HI>Lords Day</HI> is &s;ome par|ticular day well known to the Churches of Chri&s;t, otherwi&s;e it was in vain, and to no purpo&s;e for the Apo&s;tles to have &s;poken a word of the Day.</P>
<P>And this day called the Lords day was a Holy Day, otherwi&s;e it could not have the holy name proper unto holy things and holy time.</P>
<P>And that the day called the <HI>Lords Day</HI> is the fir&s;t day of the week, this hath been pro|ved both by the Te&s;timonies of all Churches in all ages, though cavelled again&s;t by &s;ome in late times, yet this their Te&s;timony may well pa&s;s for legal Te&s;timony in any Court of Ju&s;tice upon Earth, and they who oppo&s;e it
<PB N="85" REF="49">mu&s;t be legally condemned for Liars.</P>
<P>And more then all this it hath been infallably proved by the Word of God, and his Works, that the fir&s;t day of the Week is the very day which the Lord by his Prophets foretold he would make to be the day in which above all other dayes we &s;hould rejoyce, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 118 24.</P>
<P>And with his Almighty hand he hath per|formed it by the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Chri&s;t Je&s;us when he rai&s;ed him from the dead, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.20. And in this very day revealing him&s;elf to his Di&s;ci|ples as the exalted head of his Church and People. And in this very day Commi&s;&s;ion|ing his Apo&s;tles, and breathing the Holy Gho&s;t in the &s;ame day upon them, to impower and enable them in all things re&s;pecting their work as Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, and particularly by the Holy Gho&s;t guiding the Apo&s;tles to &s;ettle the fir&s;t day of the Week in all the Churches of Chri&s;t, as it is the Lords day and our Chri&s;tian Sabbath: but more of this in that which followeth.</P>
<P>And thus that which the Lord hath wrought according to his Word, may well pa&s;s or divine Te&s;timony in the Court of Con&s;ecience, that the fir&s;t day of the week is by Divine
<PB N="86" REF="50">In&s;titution the Lords Day, and our Chri&s;tian Sabbath.</P>
<P>And now let us proceed in the &s;econd place to prove that the fir&s;t day of the week, which the Lord hath made by his word and works to be the Lords Day and our Chri&s;tian Sabbath, was &s;ettled by the Apo&s;tles in all the Churches in the primitive time.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By their Doctrine, <HI>Secondly,</HI> By their Practice.</P>
<P N="1">1. By their Doctrine, for for the clearing of this, let us con&s;ider; <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.8.9.</P>
<P>Where the Apo&s;tle doth by his Doctrine inform us of a Re&s;t which remaineth to the People of God, and another day of Re&s;t; and to make way for the Argument, let us open that Scripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> he &s;peaks of a Sabbati&s;m, &s;o the Word in the Original is, a Re&s;t re&s;embled by the &s;eventh day Re&s;t, &s;poken of in the third and fourth ver&s;es, and by the Re&s;t in the Land of Canaan mentioned in the &s;eventh and eighth ver&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is another Re&s;t, and therefore ano|ther day for this Re&s;t: thus in 8, <HI>&amp;</HI> 9 ver&s;es, and I &s;hall at pre&s;ent content my &s;elf with <HI>Pa|reus</HI> his Expo&s;ition until I meet with a better; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> in the P&s;alms to which the Apo&s;tle
<PB N="87" REF="50">had re&s;pect, did &s;peak of another Re&s;t, and a day of Re&s;t which is neither the &s;eventh day Re&s;t, nor the Re&s;t in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but &s;ignified and exemplified by the one, and &s;ha|dowed out by the other and the Apo&s;tles de|mon&s;tration of this Doctrine may be expound|ed by ad sjunctive Syllogi&s;me.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> Either it is of the fir&s;t re&s;t of God in which he cea&s;ed from the Works of Creation or of that re&s;t in <HI>Canaan,</HI> or of &s;ome other re&s;t, and of another day of re&s;t, but not of the two former; and therefore the conclu&s;ion of the Apo&s;tle is in the 8th and 9th ver&s;es of ano|ther Sabbath of re&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. This re&s;t, and day of re&s;t &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle remaineth, &s;o it is expre&s;s in the words of the 9th ver&s;e, which remaining pro|perly, belongs to this re&s;t, intimating by this his Doctrine, that the other re&s;t, the &s;eventh day re&s;t is removed, for the remaining &s;igni|fieth the &s;tability and permanency of this Go|&s;pel re&s;t, and the day of that re&s;t, but the re|moving of the thing &s;haken, that tho&s;e things which cannot be &s;haken may remain, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.27. The re&s;t on the &s;eventh day, and that day of re&s;t was mi&s;erably &s;haken by the &s;in and fall of man, which brought the Cur&s;e not only upon him&s;elf and his Po&s;terity, but upon
<PB N="88" REF="51">the works of Creation; and therefore the Lord did not only threaten to de&s;troy Man, but likewi&s;e to de&s;troy the Bea&s;ts, the Creep|ing things, and the Fowls of the Air; for &s;aith the Lord, it repenteth me that I have made them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.7.</P>
<P>Thus was the &s;eventh dayes Sabbath which was a memorial of Gods re&s;ting from, and complacency in his works of Creation, &s;ha|ken by Mans &s;in, and Gods cur&s;e upon the Creatures becau&s;e of Man, and the Com|mandment for the &s;anctifying the &s;eventh dayes Sabbath did remain as a hand-writing again&s;t &s;inful and fallen Man, as other Ordi|nances and Hand-writings did, until Chri&s;t comes and brings in better Ordinances, and a better day of re&s;t which remaineth as the A|po&s;tle by his Doctrine in&s;tructeth us.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Re&s;t and day of Re&s;t which remain|eth, is that into which Chri&s;t fir&s;t entred, and at length did perfectly po&s;&s;e&s;s, and into which he leadeth his People, but Chri&s;t entred into his re&s;t the fir&s;t day of the week, when he ro&s;e from the dead, and at length he pa&s;&s;ed in|to the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Man&s;ions and re&s;t|ing places, <HI>ver.</HI> 14. and he that entred into his re&s;t cea&s;ed from his Works as God did from his, <HI>ver.</HI> 10.</P>
<PB N="89" REF="51">
<P N="5">5. The remaining of this day of Re&s;t is &s;poken of in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e; it is &s;aid there|fore there remaineth a Re&s;t, &s;o that it is that which at pre&s;ent the people of God do po&s;&s;e&s;s although the perfection of it is re&s;erved for them when they &s;hall come to the Man&s;ions prepared by Chri&s;t for them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.2, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.11. the words being thus opened the Argu|ment now follows.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> That if the People of God have ano|ther day of Re&s;t which is not the &s;eventh day re&s;t, but that which Chri&s;t doth lead them in|to by his own Example, and by way of com|munion with him who entred into his re&s;t in the fir&s;t day of the week, then the fir&s;t day of the week is the day of our Go&s;pel Re&s;t, and of our Chri&s;tian Sabbath, and con&s;equently a ce&s;&s;ation of the &s;eventh dayes Sabbath; but the proof of all the&s;e particulars we have in the former: and concerning Chri&s;ts entring into his Re&s;t on the fir&s;t day of the Week, I &s;hall yet &s;peak more fully concerning that as I &s;hall meet with it in &s;ome of the Objections of <HI>John Rogers.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, to prove that the Apo|&s;tles by their Doctrine did &s;ettle the fir&s;t day of the week to be our Chri&s;tian Sabbath, we may &s;ee in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.12.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="52">
<P N="1">1. That which is there expre&s;t is by way of precept and injunction, for &s;o the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, he had given order concerning the col|lection of the Saints, and therefore not left it as a matter of indifferency or liberty, but who&s;oever did neglect this, did tran&s;gre&s;s the Apo&s;tolical precept and order.</P>
<P N="2">2. This order for the collection for the Saints was not only &s;ent to the Churches at <HI>Corinth,</HI> but to the Churches at <HI>Galatia,</HI> &s;o that it was an order and injunction common to the Churches:</P>
<P N="3">3. The order did not only re&s;pect the col|lection it &s;elf, but the time and day of it, that upon the fir&s;t day of the week, let every one lay by him in &s;tore, as God hath pro&s;pered him: &s;o it is expre&s;s in the 2^d^. ver&s;e, now the Argument follows.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> The fir&s;t day of the week was either a common and indifferent day, or a holy day, the day of the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, but no com|mon and indifferent day; for how could the Apo&s;tle by his injunction and order, make it nece&s;&s;ary for the Churches to attend this work of mercy, collection for the Saints on the fir&s;t day of the week, if it was but a com|mon day, and thus e&s;teem one common day above another contrary to his Doctrine, <HI>Rom.</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="52">14.5. far be it from us to think that the Apo|&s;tle could &s;o contradict his own Doctrine, but it was becau&s;e the fir&s;t day of the week was made to be a holy day, and &s;uch works of mer|cy are very &s;uitable unto the day.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Arg.</HI> Or thus, the Apo&s;tle did order collection for the Saints to be on the fir&s;t day of the week, either becau&s;e it was the Chri&s;ti|an Sabbath, or for &s;ome other rea&s;ons, but I have &s;o long waited to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r of &s;ome other rea|&s;ons, why the Apo&s;tle &s;hould lay an injunction upon all Churches to have &s;uch an honourable re&s;pect to this day, without any con&s;ideration of it as the Lords Day and Chri&s;tian Sabbath, and all the Objectors and Cavillers again&s;t the fir&s;t day of the week the Lords day, have not brought forth the lea&s;t appearance of any rea&s;on to the contrary, that I confe&s;s I begin to think, that the Opponents them&s;elves with|in them&s;elves, have received a Sentence of de&s;pair of giving any rea&s;on, only they have travelled and brought forth one poor Obje|ction, that there is not a word &s;poken of a Sabbath here, and who &s;aith there is? but the Argument is taken from the Apo&s;tles Order, and by Apo&s;tolical Order advanced the fir&s;t day of the week above any other day, and that the rea&s;on of this is, either becau&s;e it is the

<P>Now in the next place, concerning the pra|ctice of the Apo&s;tles &amp; the practice of the Churches, of which much may be &s;aid in or|der to their attendance to holy Duties in the fir&s;t day of the week, becau&s;e it was a day &s;eparated for holy Wor&s;hip, but at pre&s;ent we may con&s;ider <HI>Acts</HI> 20.7.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it was a Church a&s;&s;embly there &s;poken of, for it is &s;aid the Di&s;ciples came together.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> the end for the &s;ake of which they came together, it was for the &s;ake of re|ligious duties, that they might partake of the Lords Supper called breaking of Bread in this place, as in <HI>Act.</HI> 2.42. and did not go alone without other Religious performances, <HI>viz.</HI> Prayer and hearing the Word Preached.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is &s;poken of as a cu&s;tom, and u&s;uall practice of the Di&s;ciples, therefore it is &s;aid on the fir&s;t day of the week when the Di&s;ciples came together. <HI>Paul</HI> having wait|ed for and taking this opportunity to Preach to them, for he abode &s;even dayes among them, but this was the la&s;t day, his being
<PB N="93" REF="53">ready to depart on the morrow, as is expre&s;t in the 7th ver&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> Hence the Argument is, <HI>Paul</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> with him either kept the Seventh day Sabbath or the fir&s;t day of the week a Chri&s;tian Sabbath, or el&s;e they kept no Sabbath at all, if they had kept the &s;eventh day Sabbath, that was the day before this Fir&s;t day of the Week, then they had a meeting after a Sabbath manner for Religious Duties, then the Evangeli&s;t would not have &s;poken of this Meeting on the Fir&s;t day as the only Church Meeting of the &s;even dayes of the A|po&s;tles abode among&s;t them; therefore it was the fir&s;t day of the Week in which <HI>Paul</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> a&s;&s;embled, and kept as a Chri&s;tian Sabbath.</P>
<P>Much more hath been &s;aid by others, and I have &s;omewhat more in readine&s;s to &s;ay if the occa&s;ion calleth for it, and God giveth oppor|tunity.</P>
<P>But at pre&s;ent having proved that the fir&s;t day of the Week was by the Lord him&s;elf made by his Word and by his Works to be the Lords day, and our Go&s;pel and Chri&s;tian Sabbath, and his Apo&s;tles were guided by the Holy Gho&s;t to &s;ettle it in the room and place of the &s;eventh day, both by their Doctrine and by their Practice; we proceed to make

<P><HI>Reply,</HI> The Reply to <HI>Iohn Rogers is,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He grants that Chri&s;t as God, is the Commander and Lord of the Sabbath.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> He denies him to be the Lord of the Sabbath, as he is God Man: to which the Reply is,</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> By God-Man is meant, God and Man per&s;onally united, that is, the Son of God having a&s;&s;umed a humane nature into per&s;onal union with his Divine nature, is both God and Man; and if he be not Lord of the Sabbath as he is God and Man then he is not head over all things as he is God and Man, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.21.22. then not Mediator as God and Man, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.5. And the Argu|ment he gives now follows:</P>
<P>For &s;aith <HI>Iohn Rogers,</HI> as he was Man he was made of a Woman, and made under the Law, hence his Argument is, if Chri&s;t as a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n was made of a Woman under the Law, then as God-Man he is not Lord of the Sabbath. If this be good Divinity then let <HI>Iohn R.</HI> pro|ceed to &s;ay, that becau&s;e he was Man, made under the Law, therefore as God Man he is not head of his Church and is not the Medi|atour, and as God Man he &s;hall not return to be the Judge of the World; this is &s;o far
<PB N="98" REF="56">from being &s;olid, that it is contrary to the frame of Go&s;pel Scriptures.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> He argues from <HI>Mark</HI> 2.28. his Expo&s;itions are the&s;e, but if thou ha&s;t re|ference to that Scripture which &s;aith, <HI>the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,</HI> he doth not &s;ay God Man but the Son of Man; whence his Argument is, if the Scripture &s;aith that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. then <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> judgeth it is not a &s;olid a&s;&s;ertion to &s;ay Chri&s;t as God Man is Lord of the Sab|bath.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> My Reply is, that if Chri&s;t the Son of Man be Lord of the Sabbath its either as he is the Son of God, or as the Son of Man, or as he is God and Man; not as the Son of God con&s;idered without being the Son of Man for the words are expre&s;s, <HI>that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Not as the Son of Man, this <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> granteth to be too low, becau&s;e thus he was under the Law, and therefore it mu&s;t be as he is God Man, that he was Lord of the Sabbath, and yet <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> &s;aith this is not a &s;olid a&s;&s;ertion, but he hath given no &s;olid Argument to the contrary, but that which fights again&s;t it &s;elf.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.

<P><HI>Reply,</HI> The Reply to <HI>John R.</HI> his An&s;wer is, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He &s;aith the work of Creation is the greate&s;t work, and his rea&s;on is becau&s;e God made all things: The Reply is,</P>
<P>That if the work of Creation be the great|e&s;t, then the work of Redemption is not &s;o great as the work of Creation; but a work is greater or le&s;&s;er according to the greatne&s;s of wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s manife&s;t in it, but the wi&s;dom of God &s;hining in the work of Redemption, excels the wi&s;dom &s;hining in the work of Creation, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.7. wi&s;dom in a my&s;tery, and the power made manife&s;t in Re|demption is greater than in Creation, called the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power towards them that do believe, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19.</P>
<P>And for goodne&s;s to finners <HI>John R.</HI> cannot but confe&s;s it is the mercifulle&s;t work, and yet he denieth that a day &s;hall be appointed for a memorial of this greate&s;t work; but as it is worthy of a Day, &s;o the Lord hath appointed the fir&s;t day of the week for that end, as hath been proved by the Scriptures abovemention|ed, and therefore it is in vain for <HI>John R.</HI> to deny it.</P>
<P>Qu. 5. The fifth Que&s;tion is, <HI>Was not the
<PB N="102" REF="58">work fini&s;hed at the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t on the fir&s;t day of the week, when he entred into his re&s;t as God did into his.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> John R. his An&s;wer is, The price was paid as &s;oon as the Sacrifice was offered, and the dead rai&s;ed; but the work of Re|demption as yet not perfected in us, for we are yet under the bondage of corruption, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.23. but to &s;ay that Chri&s;t entred into his Re&s;t on the fir&s;t day of the week I cannot, for he did a&s;&s;emble him&s;elf with his Di&s;ciples af|ter his Re&s;urrection, being &s;een of them forty dayes before he a&s;cended up into Heaven, and upon the day of his Re&s;urrection did eat with his Di&s;ciples, and did travail with them, which was Labour.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> The Reply is, that <HI>Iohn</HI> R. denieth that the work of Redemption was fini&s;hed, becau&s;e it is not fini&s;hed in us: Whence his Argument is,</P>
<P>That if Redemption be not perfected in Believers, then not fini&s;hed by Chri&s;t: but this is fal&s;e rea&s;oning for want of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between the work of Redemption and the work of Application: Chri&s;ts work of Re|demption may be fini&s;hed although the work of the Holy Gho&s;t as &s;ent from the Father and the Son to apply Redemption may not be

<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Reply is, Either Chri&s;t was on the fir&s;t day of the Week in a &s;tate of Humi|liation, or a &s;tate of Exaltation: if in a &s;tate of Humiliation, then his Re&s;urrection was no degree of his Exaltation, contrary to <HI>Rom</HI> 1.3, 4 <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.20, 21. if he were in a &s;tate of Exalta|tion then in a &s;tate of ble&s;&s;ed and glorious Re&s;t: And although there are divers de|grees of his Exaltation, as his Re&s;urrection, A&s;cention, Se&s;&s;ion at the right hand of the Father, and his return at the la&s;t Day to be the Judge, but Re&s;urrection is one degree of his Exaltation and of his Re&s;t; and therefore he was entred into Re&s;t, although for the con|viction and confirmation of His Di&s;ciples, he did &s;hew him&s;elf, and by &s;ome &s;en&s;ible &s;igns make it manife&s;t that it was him&s;elf, that very humane nature which had &s;uffered death, was rai&s;ed, that he that de&s;cended was rai&s;ed, and is the &s;ame al&s;o that a&s;cended into Heaven <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.10.</P>

<P>That a Sabbath as a Sabbath is fir&s;t and la&s;t in the Precept, and &s;hall not be changed, but the particular day is &s;econdarily &s;pecified, and is mutable as other po&s;itive Laws are, the Lord having re&s;erved a liberty to him&s;elf to change them according to his Royal plea&s;ure, and who &s;hall &s;ay he hath done iniquity? And as for <HI>Iohn</HI> R. his Argument, &s;o far as it hath any colour of rea&s;on in it, is. That &s;eeing Chri&s;t came not to de&s;troy the Law but to fulfil it, and that in every jot and tittle of it, and there|fore not to change the &s;eventh dayes Sabbath into the fir&s;t day of the Week, and to this we &s;hall po&s;itively and plainly Reply.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There is that which may be cal|led an actual fulfilling in all and every particu|lar point and duty required in the Decalogue, but Chri&s;t did never actually fulfil the particu|lar Duties of Parents to Children of a Hu&s;|band
<PB N="112" REF="63">to a Wi&s;e and many other particular points and duties contained in the Decalogue and yet his fulfilling all and every one of tho&s;e Duties which had any &s;uitablene&s;s to his &s;ta|tion and work, as he had opportunity in rela|tion to God or Man, this is called a fulfilling of all righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.15.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> There is an actual fulfilling of the Law literally; and in this &s;ence the Prie&s;t in his Labour in Sabbath duties of his Office, might be &s;aid to prophane the Sabbath, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.5.</P>
<P>And a fulfilling &s;piritually and finally accor|ding to the true &s;cope of the Law, and thus he was &s;aid to be blamele&s;s, and &s;o may we, if we keep that day holy which Chri&s;t hath appoint|ed as mo&s;t &s;uitable to Go&s;pel times and the mo&s;t &s;piritual &s;cope of the fourth Command, although we prophane the &s;eventh day Sab|bath.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To come nearer to the Text mentioned, Chri&s;t came not to make any de|&s;tructive change of the Law but to fulfil it; and therefore to make a perfecting or per&s;e|ctive change: And the Godly, Learned do note that the word to de&s;troy the Law &s;igni|fies to di&s;&s;olve or pull it in pieces, Chri&s;t came not to di&s;&s;olve or pull the Law in pieces, and
<PB N="113" REF="63">leave the wills of Men to a lawle&s;s liberty, but to bring in a &s;tricter holine&s;s and righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and a more perfect Admini&s;tration and edition of the Law, and this is expre&s;ly his &s;cope, and Chri&s;t him&s;elf expounds his mean|ing in the following part of the Chapter, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. whil&s;t Chri&s;t gives a more &s;piritual expo&s;ition than the corrupt <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> did, who did cleave to and pervert the Letter of the Law, as this <HI>Jewi&s;h Sabbatarian</HI> doth the letter of the fourth Command: but when Chri&s;t changeth the &s;eventh day Sabbath to the fir&s;t day of the week, that is the Sabbath from the &s;eventh day of the week to the fir&s;t day of the week, with re&s;pect to the commemoration, not only of the old Creation which is &s;ubje|cted unto corruption, but the new Creation the work of Redemption which &s;hall remain: what de&s;tructive change is this of the Law in any one jott or tittle of it, and no more rea|&s;on for any to complain of a change then they had when Chri&s;t changed, and made water in|to wine; if <HI>John Rogers</HI> cannot chu&s;e but re|fu&s;eth this Go&s;pel wine, yet let him not &s;corn and &s;coff at us, for our thankful receiving of it: And if <HI>Beza</HI> be in &s;o good credit with <HI>J. R.</HI> as he &s;eemeth to intimate, let him credit <HI>Beza</HI> in this matter al&s;o, who atte&s;teth that in
<PB N="114" REF="64">an ancient Copy he had found it thus Recor|ded, That the Apo&s;tle had given order for the Collections in the fir&s;t day of the week with this added the Lords Day, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.2.</P>
<P>But &s;eeing this <HI>Judaizer</HI> and others of his per&s;wa&s;ion have &s;o wre&s;ted this Text, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.17. we &s;hall add one con&s;ideration more for the clearing of the &s;ame, and our Argument is this.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> As Chri&s;t came to fulfil the Law, &s;o likewi&s;e he came to fulfil the Prophets, &s;o it is expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.17. <HI>think not</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>that I am come to de&s;troy the Law or the Pro|phets, I am not come to de&s;troy but to fulfil.</HI></P>
<P>But Chri&s;t did fulfil the Prophets, their pro|phecies by performing and an&s;wering the &s;cope and end of the &s;ame, and by changing the Prophecies into performances: Oh mo&s;t happy and glorious change, without which the Prophets their Prophecies could not have been fulfilled! this was far off from a de|&s;tructive change of one jott or tittle of the Prophecies.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e Chri&s;t did fulfil the Law, and particularly that Law the fourth Command|ment, by performing and an&s;wering the &s;cope and end of it, and by changing not the Sab|bath as a Sabbath, but by changing of the Sab|bath from the &s;eventh day to the fir&s;t day of
<PB N="115" REF="64">the week, and this was no de&s;tructive change of one jott or tittle of the fourth Command, but a mo&s;t happy and glorious change with re|&s;pect to the glory of the Law-giver, and the good of his People, which ble&s;&s;ed ends are more fully and perfectly attained by the change, than could po&s;&s;ibly be by a &s;eventh day Sabbath, as is more fully explicated in my Catechi&s;m; &s;o that the fourth Command complains not, it is wronged not a jott, or tittle of it de&s;troyed, no more than when ve&s;&s;els of Bra&s;s or Earthen Ve&s;&s;els are turned into Gold and that which is le&s;s perfect is turned into that which is more perfect, for though the Law of God is ever perfect as to the time and &s;ub|ject for whom it is fitted, and &s;o as the &s;eventh day Sabbath as it re&s;pected the time and &s;ub|jects for whom it was fitted, but yet when the fir&s;t day of the week is appointed by the Lord of the Sabbath as mo&s;t &s;uitable to Go&s;pel times, and the &s;ubjects of Go&s;pel Admini&s;tra|tions; now that which was le&s;s perfect re&s;pe|cting this time and &s;tate mo&s;t give place to that which is more perfect, and in this the fourth Command is not de&s;troyed but fulfilled, the Law being no Enemy to the Go&s;pel, but like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> do ki&s;s one another upon the Mount of the Lord, and thus doth the fourth

R.</HI> I leave to his own Con&s;cience, and the Con|&s;ciences of others: I am only at pre&s;ent cal|led to declare the Rule out of the Word of God by which we ought to judge; and let o|thers who are eye-witne&s;&s;es, and ear-witne&s;&s;es of his practice give in their Te&s;timony when they are called thereunto: But I conclude, that if the Spirit of Chri&s;t was not only in the Martyrs, the Witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t, but like|wi&s;e in our godly Predece&s;&s;ours, Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> and in many others in <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>New England:</HI> That Spirit that is contrary to the Spirit of Chri&s;t in tho&s;e Worthies is an Anti|chri&s;tian

<P>But now I &s;hall ha&s;ten unto a Conclu&s;ion, <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> concludes his writing with &s;even Que&s;tions: The Preface to them is this; <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> &s;aith, I de&s;ire you &s;ince we are under Sufferings by you, that thou woulde&s;t pro|cure and return me a direct An&s;wer to my &s;e|ven Que&s;tions un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">erwrit, without &s;hifting or &s;hunning the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn R.</HI> his fir&s;t Que&s;tion is;</P>
<P>Qu. 1. <HI>Whether Sin is imputed where no Law is?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> That &s;eeing the Law, whither Moral or Go&s;pel, contains a Platform of well-doing, the contrary to this is Sin, and if no Law then no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but Chri&s;t is our Judge, our Law-giver, and our King, and he will &s;ave us, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 33.22. and he hath given us his command to keep the fir&s;t day of the week holy as the Lords day: And the <HI>Mo&s;aical
<PB N="127" REF="70">Law</HI> re&s;pecting the &s;eventh day Sabbath, in which <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Rogers</HI> tru&s;teth, &s;hall condemn him for his di&s;obedience again&s;t the Law of Chri&s;t, which is Lord of the Sabbath, as we have pro|ved already; and thus he hath an An&s;wer to his fir&s;t Que&s;tion, and likewi&s;e to his &s;econd Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether there can be Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion where no Law is.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> his third Que&s;tion followeth;</P>
<P>Qu. 3. <HI>Whither or no God hath given Laws &s;ufficiently to reprove &s;uch as are Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, or is &s;hort in his Laws and &s;o need many A&s;&s;i|&s;tants?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Gods Laws are perfectly &s;ufficient, and they need no A&s;&s;i&s;tants, but we need A&s;&s;i|&s;tants to look to the Application and Execu|tion of them again&s;t Malefactors, and to be a terror to evil Doers; and be&s;ides many other Rea&s;ons to prove this, the experience of <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> his behaviour may be &s;ufficient to con|vince us that the government have need of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, although the Law it &s;elf needs none.</P>
<P>Qu. 4. <HI>Hath God any Law to forbid work on the fir&s;t day of the week, and that gives liber|ty to work on the &s;eventh?</HI></P>
<P>Take likewi&s;e his fifth Que&s;tion almo&s;t the &s;ame with the fourth, and then we &s;hall an&s;wer them together.</P>
<PB N="128" REF="71">
<P>Qu. 5: <HI>Hath God by any of his Me&s;&s;engers or otherwi&s;e in Scripture called the fir&s;t day of the week the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, or is it a humane in|vention, if not humane, quote the place in Scri|pture, for a thing is known by the name of it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I An&s;wer both to the fourth and fifth Que&s;tion, I have proved it already by many Arguments from aforementioned Scriptures, that the fir&s;t day of the week is by Chri&s;ts Commandment the day appointed to be the Lords day, and our Chri&s;tian Sabbath, and therefore I refer him for an An&s;wer to that which hath been already &s;aid.</P>
<P>Qu. 6. <HI>If any Sect produce Con&s;equence from Scripture, as the Judge to uphold their O|pinion, and it appear to be altogether contrary to the plain Word of God in the Scripture, whither or no I &s;hould look at it to be con&s;equence or blind|ne&s;s in the Sect?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The Con&s;equence from Scripture is either a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, and being ac|cording to Scripture, is of as full force as any plain Scripture, as <HI>John Rogers</HI> granted in his An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Que&s;tion, or el&s;e it is a Con&s;equence &s;eemingly deduced from Scripture, but is really a perverting of, and contrary to the Scripture, as &s;ome unlearned and un&s;table, who wre&s;t the Scriptures to
<PB N="129" REF="71">their own de&s;truction, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.16. and then it is far off from being of the &s;ame force with the Scripture: But we have given <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> nece&s;&s;ary deductions from plain Scriptures in the Old and New Te&s;tament, to prove that the fir&s;t day of the week is the Lords day, and our Chri&s;tian Sabbath; and it is in vain for <HI>Iohn R.</HI> to deny this until the Arguments be confuted.</P>
<P>Qu 7. <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> his &s;eventh Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether or no there be a po&s;&s;ibility to take out the day commanded out of the fourth Commandment, and put in one of the &s;ix working dayes, in the room thereof, and not alter one jott or one tittle of the former Law, if there be a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a thing, or ever &s;uch a thing was?</HI> I de&s;ire a Copy of it may be &s;ent me to the Pri&s;on as &s;oon as may be.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> My An&s;wer to this &s;eventh Que&s;tion is, that I have already proved in my Reply to his An&s;wer to the tenth Que&s;tion, that this change of the Sabbath from the &s;eventh day to the fir&s;t day of the week is no de&s;tructive but a perfecting change, and &s;o far from de|&s;troying the Law in a jott or tittle of it, that it is a fulfilling of the Law as really and fully as the performances of Prophecies are the fulfilling of Prophecies, and it is too late for
<PB N="130" REF="72"><HI>John Rogers</HI> now to que&s;tion, whither that be po&s;&s;ible to be done which is already certainly performed and done as we have proved al|ready; and as for &s;ome fragments of Obje|ctions and Cavils which <HI>I. R.</HI> hath gathered out of &s;ome late Authors, and yet if all the&s;e be put together he is unable to defend his &s;e|venth day Sabbath.</P>
<P>And it is as po&s;&s;ible for <HI>I. R.</HI> to hinder the charge of the Moon as he can hinder the change of the &s;eventh day Sabbath, &s;eeing it is founded upon the works of Creation which is given to change: but who can hinder the &s;tability &amp; immutability of the fir&s;t day of the Week, the Lords day; which is grounded upon the unchangeable work of our Re|deemer, according to an immutable and ever|la&s;ting Covenant: And if it be not po&s;&s;ible for <HI>I. R.</HI> yet to &s;ee the rea&s;on of this but ad|mire at his legal light, and de&s;pi&s;e Go&s;pel vi|&s;ions: <HI>Behold ye de&s;pi&s;ers wonder and peri&s;h, for I work a work in your dayes, a work which you &s;hall in no wi&s;e believe, though a man declare it unto you,</HI> Act. 13.41. and yet tho&s;e who have the Revelations of the Spirit of Wi&s;dom in the Go&s;pel, &s;hall &s;ay, this is the Lords doings, it is marvellous in our eyes, this is the day which the Lord hath made; <HI>Save now I be&s;eech
<PB N="131" REF="72">thee O Lord, ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</HI> P&s;al. 118.23, 24, 25, 26.</P>
<P>And if he that de&s;pi&s;ed the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and particularly did prophane the &s;eventh day Sabbath was &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed, as <HI>Iohn</HI> R. did note, of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath de&s;pi&s;ed the Go&s;pel Commandment, and particularly the Lords day the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, the Ordi|nance and In&s;titution of Chri&s;t which he hath by his Blood purcha&s;ed, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.28, 29.</P>
<P>And thus I have done likewi&s;e with <HI>Iohn R.</HI> his Que&s;tions at pre&s;ent; and if <HI>I. R.</HI> or any for him &s;hall undertake to make a Reply to that which hath been &s;aid, I expect they &s;hould an&s;wer my Arguments <HI>interminis,</HI> according as they are in the frame and method of them: I do not intend for the future to trouble my &s;elf with an An&s;wer to &s;uch Lax Di&s;cour&s;es as have nothing of the frame of an Argument with them.</P>
<P>And thus at pre&s;ent I have done &s;peaking to Man, but this I may &s;ay, <HI>Oh Lord, I have not de&s;ired the woful day, that which came out of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ips was right before thee, be not thou a terror to me, thou art my hope in the day of evil,</HI> Jerem. 17.16, 17.</P>
<P>And if in any thing I have &s;aid for matter or

<P>And whereas the Plague is come into a neighbouring Plantation, and &s;ome Families already &s;hut up, the Lord have mercy upon them, and humble us deeply for our great un|fruitfulne&s;s and e&s;pecially for our prophana|tion of the Lords D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y: what is the cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e of this &s;o fierce wrath to let loo&s;e a Spirit of Er|ror an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Delu&s;ion thus to rage, that tho&s;e who received not the love of the truth may be de|livered up to believe a lye, and damned that have plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, (2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 10.11, 12) And whil&s;t &s;ome ri&s;e up that they might ca&s;t down the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, under a pretence of advancing the &s;eventh day Sab|bath; <HI>Oh Lord, let not the evil one prevail with the prophanene&s;s of others to cau&s;e them to neg|lect holy time and holy things.</HI></P>
