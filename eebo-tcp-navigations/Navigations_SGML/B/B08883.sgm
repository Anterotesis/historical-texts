<P><HI>When Eight Ships were overwhelmed by the Fre&s;hes, of which Six were (as not lying difficult) removed and cleared the fir&s;t month; the other Two being great and deep laden, &s;unk in the be&s;t of the Harbour, were blown up with Gun-powder a few months after, with &s;ome particulars of what Change happened that Harbour thereupon to this pre&s;ent</HI> Augu&s;t <HI>following.</HI></P>
<P>THE two Wrecks called Mr. <HI>Vicars,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Grayes</HI> Ships, &s;unk where before was not above 10, 12, to 14 foot at low water; the one L lying on her broad &s;ide, the other K back-broken, &s;ate right up, fa&s;t dockt, the Fre&s;hes running with &s;uch violence from We&s;tward above, betwixt both Ships; and almo&s;t round about them &s;uch a whirle Neddee of water, as may be compared to an Oriocano of wind, had the fir&s;t Month &s;coured a Channel on the We&s;t &s;ide of, and neer both the&s;e Wrecks, deep as they are marked 28, 30, to 33 foot al&s;o at low water, which Channel would have run lower, and &s;o &s;ettled the Ships out of harms way, had they not at that depth met with a hard Cole-Mine; whereas at the Ea&s;t-&s;ide towards the Barre the old depth of 10, 12, to 14 foot at low water con|tinued notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t Storms, Surfs and Spring-Tides that happened out the Sea over the Barre, &s;o neer the Wrecks for two months together after the Wrecks were &s;o &s;ettled.</P>
<P>For it was the Fre&s;hes that overwhelmed the&s;e eight Ships in <HI>December,</HI> 1672. which no Storms ever did, whereof the&s;e two L, K &s;unk in the be&s;t of the Harbour, as appears by the two Light-hou&s;es C, D and the Barre M, for no Ships could &s;teer into the Harbour by the lights, but mu&s;t run hazard of being &s;poild, if not quite &s;plit upon the Wrecks, they being be&s;et in &s;uch a manner as the Wreck L, defended K, from the Sea, Ea&s;t, and K the like for L, from the Fre&s;hes We&s;t, that they were ab&s;olutely fixt for Ages to continue, and that Harbour like to be lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the Powder-bla&s;ts upon the&s;e two Wrecks L, K, a few alterations hath appeared near the Barre to the bet|ter, <HI>viz.</HI> the Wrecks lying &s;o near the Hurd Sands N, cau&s;ed &s;uch a &s;trong Sluce betwixt that and the Wrecks, that it hath thrown the Hurd up further Southward, and con&s;equently the River and the Barre broader than it was before at that place, which is the cau&s;e of this in publick. Some &s;mall alterations al&s;o it hath cau&s;ed on &s;undry Sands up the River, of which every Wherry-man can inform, although by what cour&s;e it hath taken &s;ince the bla&s;ts: All tho&s;e places are like in a year or two's time, to return to its old &s;tation; for after the Ship L that had Lead in, was blown away, where at fir&s;t it &s;unk was but 10, 12, to 14 foot, after thirty dayes were 28, 30, to 33 foot, and after the bla&s;t one third part of four hundred peeces Lead being taken up at about 28 foot deep, within twenty daies after it &s;hallowed to 17 and 20 foot, and daily more, till all the re&s;t of the Lead became buried.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Wrecks, one very near, and the other above 400 Ton full, laden with Coals, &amp;c. weighed about eight hundred thou&s;and pound weight apiece, be&s;ides the empty Ships, which by the Ship-Carpenters Rule of proportion ought with all her Ma&s;ts, Anchors, Tackle, Rigging, &amp;c. to weigh near as much as her Lading in weighty Commodi|ties, if &s;he be de&s;igned long liv'd; to the&s;e add &s;o many hundred Ton of Water or Sea atop of them. The difficulty of conveying a Powder-che&s;t to execute under Water at them on the out-&s;ide of the Ships, many, <HI>viz.</HI> their lying &s;o near the Barre, that what by one con&s;tant cour&s;e or other happening every year, in three quarters thereof it could not be performed; for three dayes before, and three dayes after every Spring-tyde, reckoning the day of the Moons change, there's half of the year gone, how often the Wind is Ea&s;t, North, or N, E in a year, either of tho&s;e, with a rea&s;onable gale, makes too great a &s;well thereabouts to &s;pend Powder-che&s;ts below; how many &s;tormy dayes are there u&s;ually in a year? when, and two dayes after every &s;torm, no dealing thereabouts in that bu&s;ine&s;s; and wor&s;e than all this, rainy-weather &s;ometimes three or four dayes, after one dayes &s;howres, the Fre&s;hes will bring down &s;o &s;wift a Current, that over again&s;t <HI>Cliffords</HI> Fort, and the Figure 30, makes for a matter of a hundred and fifty fathom length, a gulf, &s;wifter than that of <HI>Florida.</HI> To all the&s;e, one difficulty more as bad as the wor&s;t, the Neddee, or Whirle of Water, would without great pains and care overturn the Engine from its de&s;igned place, which &s;undry particular difficulties I mention, becau&s;e &s;ome unskilful pretenders to this part of the Mathematicks, expected that &s;o great a weight and bulk before-mentioned, be&s;ides Lead and Stones, in one of them, &s;hould with one Che&s;t containing &s;even barrels of Powder, be blown up from that depth, &s;o ea&s;ie and &s;o high above Water, as the Boyes &s;end up Kites, which could not have been hoped from &s;even thou&s;and barrels, the Ships not being to be undermined, and the Powder-che&s;ts being fired at the &s;ides of the Ships; but, were &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s to be done in the Waters of <HI>Thames,</HI> as many Che&s;ts might be &s;pent, and Ships blown up in twenty dayes, as could be done at this Barre in a year at &s;uch weather as was there &s;ix months together; and every day one could be done to an empty Ship in &s;uch &s;treams as the <HI>Thames,</HI> and where the Che&s;t could be conveyed in the hold.</P>
<P>At any of which Weathers, or at the neare&s;t of a Slack (if any ever be there) all former known waies would have failed, as divers (to any other purpo&s;e but vain expences) were endeavoured before my coming there; for no flying Fu&s;ee would burn to the bottom, but either bend or break, which mu&s;t needs choak or drown the Wild-fire by the way; &s;o that po&s;&s;ibility it &s;elf became to be que&s;tioned, whether ever the Harbour were like to be cleared, or at the be&s;t to the co&s;t of many thou&s;ands; thereupon the Magi&s;trates &s;ent up a Relation of the dangerous condition His Ma|je&s;ties Port of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> was in; His Maje&s;tie was plea&s;ed to &s;end unto them a new way to convey a Fire-Ball through a hollow Ma&s;t fa&s;tned to the Che&s;t at the bottom of the Sea, the Che&s;t &s;haped and ordered within and without in &s;uch a figure, as the de&s;igned place could be executed upon, as true under Water, as Guns can &s;end out Bullets above, which hi|therto was never known, or at lea&s;t not known to be practi&s;ed in any Country by any Nation what&s;oever before; by virtue whereof the Author can de&s;troy and remove all &s;uch Sinckers, as was this and the la&s;t year, or at any time here|after may be de&s;igned by the enemy, as certain (without undermining) as Rocks (which cannot be done but with un|dermining) can be blown up above ground, whether the Sinckers are fill'd with Sand, Coals, Stones, Bricks, Morter, in a ma&s;s, or loo&s;e, the like of any other matter of weight what&s;oever.</P>
<P>And in regard the appearance of Smoak above Water after the bla&s;t &s;o far under, hath &s;tartled the inqui&s;itive Chimi&s;t in point of nature, that the Sea-water being &s;alt, and Gun-powder likewi&s;e &s;alt, its Smoak al&s;o &s;alt, mu&s;t therefore certainly incorporate together, and none of that Smoak ever be &s;een above-water.</P>
<P>I have purpo&s;ely placed this figure V to &s;hew how the Water and Smoak, with pieces of the Ship did appear for a moment or two above water, a matter of a quarter of a minute after the Powder took fire below, without any contra|diction to that rule of nature; for the&s;e &s;ix or &s;even barrels of Powder &s;pent together under Water, produced no more Smoak or report above, than is u&s;ual from one Ordnance (although tho&s;e that &s;tood a mile off upon the Hills, felt the ground &s;hake under them at the blow) and doubtle&s;s therefore by that natural rule, the Smoak mu&s;t all have di&s;&s;ol|ved into the Salt-water, had the bla&s;t been deeper, or the quantity of Powder le&s;s, which being &s;o much, and the mo|tion &s;o &s;wift through &s;uch a &s;hallow as twenty eight foot, &s;ome Smoak appeared above, by the &s;ame rule, as a Gnatt pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;mall flame, mu&s;t di&s;&s;olve in the flame; but by rea&s;on of its &s;wift pa&s;&s;age, part of him appears &s;corcht on th'other &s;ide. And for another Gentlemans opinion, to confirm the foregoing, that this lower Smoak W having not &s;o &s;wift a way as the uppermo&s;t X before it: where the report began was therefore the &s;adder colour, as if it had been dyed in the pa&s;&s;age, is not &s;o probable, but palpable to the contrary in my opinion; rather that the &s;adne&s;s of the Smoak about the Water W pa&s;&s;ing through the Ship, and up with the Coals, became blacki&s;h by the Coals; and nothing more certain, but that almo&s;t all the Smoak was mingled with the Sea; el&s;e had but half of it broke out above at X, it mu&s;t con&s;equently have &s;haken both South and North Sheilds.</P>
