<HEAD>The pre&s;ent State of CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the Thirtieth day of <HI>January,</HI> 1665. I went in the company of Mr. <HI>Carlos Daty,</HI> to vi&s;it Father <HI>John Grueber</HI> at his arrival from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> About two years &s;ince, he came out of <HI>China,</HI> where he had re&s;ided full three years.

<PB N="3" REF="3">barren and wild, that one of the Neighboring people can have any temptation to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the antient Inhabitants. Nothing is there re|markable, but only &s;ome few di&s;|per&s;ed Tents of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who lead a mo&s;t mi&s;erable life.</P>
<P>The beautiful River <HI>Toktokai,</HI> which is as large as <HI>Danubinus,</HI> but &s;o &s;hallow, that any Man, on Hor&s;e|back, may ford it over in the deepe&s;t place, watereth this ble&s;&s;ed Coun|trey, and gives unto it a name. From hence our Traveller pa&s;&s;ed through the Province of <HI>Tangut,</HI> which is very populous and belongs to the Kingdom of <HI>Barantola;</HI> he vi&s;ited, in his way, the City of <HI>Retink,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Barantola,</HI> the <HI>Me|tropolis</HI> is called <HI>La&s;&s;a,</HI> and the pre|&s;ent King <HI>Teva.</HI> He is of a very an|tient and noble Family of the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> of <HI>Tangut.</HI> His ordinary re|&s;idence is at <HI>Butala,</HI> a lofty Ca&s;tle built according to the <HI>European</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4">mode upon a high Hill, having Buildings of four &s;tories, of very good and regular workman&s;hip. The Court of this Prince is numerous, and his attendants are extream lavi&s;h in their apparel, which is, for the mo&s;t part, of Cloath of Gold, and of embroidered Stuffs. Neverthe|le&s;s this Nation is generally very &s;lutti&s;h, and unhand&s;ome in their attire: Neither Men nor Women wear lining next to their skin. Their common Bed is the ground, their ordinary food is raw Fle&s;h, and they are not &s;o &s;crupulous to wa&s;h their hands or faces; but they appear very kind and courteous to &s;tran|gers. Their Women have the liber|ty to walk about the Streets, as among&s;t the other <HI>Tartars;</HI> but their other Cu&s;toms are like to tho&s;e of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Their Arch-Prie&s;t or Mufty is called <HI>Lamacongi&ugrave;,</HI> whom they re|verence as God, and believe to be
<PB N="5" REF="4">related to their fir&s;t King, but they name him the Brother of all the the Kings of the World. They are per&s;waded that he ri&s;eth from the dead as often as he dies, and that this Man hath already ri&s;en &s;even times. The Kings and Polititians of that Countrey labor, by &s;ubtil means, to entertain the common people, in this &s;trange belief, and the <HI>Lamacongiu</HI> him&s;elf contributes to it; for he keeps his face always covered, and &s;uffers none to look upon it, but &s;uch as are acquainted with the my&s;tery. The Nobility do mightily re&s;pect him; &s;ome of them come to that point of adoration, as to covet that which is incredible, and to carry it about as a &s;acred relick: From <HI>Barantola,</HI> Father <HI>Grueber</HI> tra|velled to the Kingdom of <HI>Nekpal,</HI> and in a moneths time pa&s;&s;ed through it. The two principal Towns are <HI>Catmandir</HI> and <HI>Patan,</HI> &s;ituate on the Banks of a River op|po&s;ite
<PB N="6" REF="5">to one another. This latter is a young Prince very well accom|pli&s;hed; he commands all the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Kingdom as General. When Father <HI>Grueber</HI> was there, he was at the head of a great Army marching again&s;t a Neighboring King called <HI>Varcam,</HI> who made frequent inroads to &s;poil the Countrey. The Je&s;uites gave this young Prince a Pro&s;pective Gla&s;s, through which he cau&s;ed him to look at a place where <HI>Varcam's</HI> Army lay encamped; he found it &s;o nigh, that he gave order pre&s;ently to make ready and prepare for the fight, for he perceived not that this propinquity was but an effect of the Gla&s;s. This pre&s;ent was acceptable to him.</P>
<P>From <HI>Nekpal</HI> our Traveller went, in five days, to the Kingdom of <HI>Mo|ranga,</HI> where he could &s;ee no City, but only &s;mall Hou&s;es covered with Straw, and little Huts, one appoint|ed for a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;se. The King
<PB N="7" REF="5">of <HI>Moranga</HI> pays a yearly tribute of 250000 Rixdollers, and &s;even Ele|phants to the <HI>Mogol.</HI> From <HI>Mo|ranga</HI> he travelled into that part of <HI>India</HI> which is beyond the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> and came to <HI>Minapor,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Countrey; where he pa&s;&s;ed over that River, which is twice as big as the <HI>Danubius.</HI> From thence he went to <HI>Patan;</HI> and from that City, in five and twenty days, to <HI>Agra,</HI> the Royal City of that part of <HI>India,</HI> which is on this &s;ide <HI>Ganges.</HI> From thence to <HI>Laor</HI> in fourteen days. This City is built upon the Banks of the River <HI>Ravi,</HI> which is as large as <HI>Danubius,</HI> it runs into <HI>India,</HI> near <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ltaia.</HI> There he took Boat and was carried down the River, in forty days to <HI>Tata,</HI> the ut|mo&s;t City of <HI>Indostan,</HI> the ordinary re&s;idence of the Viceroy of that Countrey; his name is <HI>Laskarkan,</HI> there he met with many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Marchants.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>From this place he &s;ailed to <HI>Or|muz</HI> by Sea, from <HI>Ormuz</HI> he went to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> afterwards he returned back to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where he took &s;hipping and arrived &s;afe at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> from thence he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he received an expre&s;s command to go back again to <HI>China.</HI> For that pur|po&s;e he travelled into <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Polonia,</HI> hoping to find another way through <HI>Mu&s;covia.</HI> By the Emperors procurement, he had got Pa&s;ports from the Dukes of <HI>Curland</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covia.</HI> But when he was &s;o far on his way as the Borders of <HI>Mu&s;|covia,</HI> he under&s;tood that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made a conjuction of their Forces, with an intent to attempt upon the Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covia.</HI> By this means he was diverted in his pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Mu&s;co;</HI> for the fear of the dangers and diffi|culties in time of War, brought him back to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he arrived at a convenient time when the Empe|ror
<PB N="9" REF="6">was di&s;patching an Amba&s;&s;ador, Count <HI>Le&s;hley</HI> by name, to <HI>Constan|tinople.</HI> The Je&s;uite took this op|portunity to travel thither with a re&s;olution, from thence to go for|ward in his intended journey: But when he came to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> he was mightily incommoded with a great rheume, with &s;hortne&s;s of breath, and with violent pains in his &s;tomach; &s;o that being not able to proceed on in his journey, he went aboard a Ship bound for <HI>Le|gorne;</HI> from whence he was carried to <HI>Florence,</HI> where he remained a|bout eight days. In this time he was pretty well recovered of his di&s;temper, &s;o that he could go after|wards to <HI>Venice;</HI> from whence he pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Friuli</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> with an intent, by that way, to re|turn to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that he might travel afterwards to <HI>China,</HI> accord|ing to the orders of his General.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P>This Father is about forty five years of age, of a jovial temper, ex|traordinary civil, as &s;incere as a <HI>Ger|man,</HI> his conver&s;ation is very plea|&s;ant; in a word, he hath &s;o many good qualities, and is &s;o gallant a Man, that though he were not a Je&s;uite, all the World would e&s;teem and love him.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Carlos Dati</HI> had &s;een him, the day before we had any di&s;|cour&s;e with him, in the With-draw|ing Room of Prince <HI>Leopold,</HI> where he was entered into a conver&s;ation with him, which la&s;ted not long; for the Father was called away and introduced into his Highne&s;&s;es pre|&s;ence. After this fir&s;t acquaintance, he intreated him to give him &s;atis|faction to &s;ome que&s;tions that he had a de&s;ire to make him concern|ing <HI>China,</HI> which reque&s;t the Father granted in an obliging manner.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Mr. <HI>Dati</HI> de&s;ired to know, whether the pre&s;ent King of <HI>China</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="7">is the Son of the la&s;t Conqueror of that Kingdom? Where he kept his Court? Whether in <HI>China?</HI> or in <HI>Tartaria?</HI> The Father an&s;wered, that he was but his Grandchild; for the Grandfather being invited and brought in by the Rebellious Eu|nuchs in the year 1646. He con|quered all <HI>China,</HI> as Father <HI>Marti|nius</HI> hath written at large in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>China.</HI> He told us, that the pre&s;ent King of that Countrey is about twelve or thirteen years of age; that he re&s;ides at <HI>Pekin,</HI> the cheif City of the Kingdom, that his Father and Grandfather al&s;o did dwell there, according to <HI>Ma|chiavels</HI> Rule; for he advi&s;eth a Prince when he intends to keep in his hands a Countrey newly &s;ub|dued to his Scepter, where the In|habitants differ from him in Lan|guage, Cu&s;toms, and Laws, to go and make there his abode. This is a Policy not &s;o &s;ubtil, but that the
<PB N="12" REF="8"><HI>Tartarians</HI> have very well under|&s;tood and practi&s;ed it.</P>
<P>We inquired next, what kind of <HI>Militia</HI> they had? And how the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> were treated by their <HI>Tar|tarian</HI> Kings?</P>
<P>He told us, that the mo&s;t part of the Soldiers of the Kingdom were <HI>Tartars,</HI> unle&s;s it be the Kings Guard which is a Body of about 40000 Men armed with Muskets and Bows of <HI>Corea</HI> or <HI>Japonia,</HI> for the mo&s;t part. That the Inhabitants were not oppre&s;&s;ed with Taxes, nor treated wor&s;e then by their former Kings; for they have all kind of Liberty and Freedom of Religion. The antient Laws are yet maintained in force all over the Countrey, and Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tred by Judges that are natural <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> only there is this alteration, a <HI>Tartarian</HI> mu&s;t a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t in every Court with a limited Autho|rity, which &s;uffers him to alter no|thing of the antient Cu&s;toms and Laws of the Countrey.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8">
<P>We de&s;ired him to tell us, what manner of Government they had under the King?</P>
<P>At <HI>Pekin,</HI> replied the Father, there are nine Judges or Courts of Judicature; and &s;o it is in all other Cities of the Kingdom, where they are called by the &s;ame names, and hear the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and highe&s;t Court is called <HI>Li-p&uacute;,</HI> where half are <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and half are <HI>Tartars.</HI> It judges all Cau&s;es proceeding out of other Courts of the Kingdom, by way of Appeal, of what nature or bu&s;ine&s;s &s;oever. The &s;econd is named al&s;o <HI>Li-p&ugrave;,</HI> but here the &s;yllable <HI>Li</HI> is pronounced in a different manner from the fir&s;t, for in the former it &s;ig|nifies <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> but in this latter word it imports <HI>Ceremony.</HI> This Court is the <HI>Forum Eccle&s;ia&s;ticum</HI> that judges of all differences be|tween the Learned; and decides all matters of controver&s;ie in Religion.
<PB N="14" REF="9">The third is &s;tiled <HI>Pim-p&ugrave;,</HI> which examines the affairs of the <HI>Militia.</HI> The fourth is for offenders, or the Criminal Court called <HI>Nim-p&ugrave;.</HI> The fift is named <HI>Cho-p&ugrave;,</HI> appointed for the Kings Trea&s;ury, as the <HI>Exchequer</HI> is among&s;t us. The &s;ixth is <HI>Cum-p&ugrave;,</HI> which hath a care of all the Kings Buildings and publick Structures, and Edifices. The &s;eventh is to &s;ee to the payment of all the Kings Of|ficers and Attendants in his Family. The eighth hath an in&s;pection over the Kings Kitchin and Table. The Father had forgot the names of the two latter Courts, and of the bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es examined in the other.</P>
<P>In every City, the&s;e nine Courts are erected &s;ubordinate to one an|other; for example, that of one City, appointed for the <HI>Militia,</HI> is under the juri&s;diction of the Pro|vincial Court, which is in the cheif City of the Province; and from that, and all others, Men appeal
<PB N="15" REF="9">to the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Kingdom for the <HI>Militia,</HI> from whence they may appeal to the highe&s;t Court, which is the <HI>Li-p&ugrave;,</HI> when it is a bu&s;ine&s;s of great importance.</P>
<P>From this Tribunal, there can be no appeal further, but to the Kings per&s;on, which is never granted without the puni&s;hment of one hun|dred ba&s;tinadoes, which every one mu&s;t patiently endure before he can be admitted to the Kings pre&s;ence. The manner of giving them is very cruel; the poor wretch is forced to lye down upon the ground, upon his Belly, with his middle and back|&s;ide naked, two men &s;it one again&s;t another upon his Neck and Legs, with two great <HI>Indian</HI> Canes in their hands attempered before in wa|ter, that they might be more pliable, then they &s;trike one after another; he that &s;its at the Head, &s;trikes up|on the Hips, and the other upon the Back, one after another &s;o fa&s;t,
<PB N="16" REF="10">that they are forced to &s;top &s;ome|times, and &s;uffer the patient to breathe; for otherwi&s;e they would beat the breath out of his Body. The <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Noblemen of the Countrey, and the <HI>Tartars,</HI> do commonly inflict this kind of puni&s;hment upon their &s;ervants, for the lea&s;t offence. He that is forced to undergo this mi&s;ery before he can come into the Kings pre&s;ence, proceeds in this manner. He is to ca&s;t in a &s;tone at the Kings Chamber Window, then he is com|manded to come in; and if the King perceives that he &s;uffers brave|ly the fir&s;t ba&s;tinadoes in &s;uch a manner, that declares his cau&s;e to be ju&s;t, and the greatne&s;s of his op|pre&s;&s;ion, he commands the Execu|tioners to forbear, and the party to relate his bu&s;ine&s;s. If it appears then, that any inju&s;tice hath been done him, all that have had any hand in the judging of the matter
<PB N="17" REF="10">before, are happy if they are di&s;|charged, only for the lo&s;s of their Offices; for commonly they are condemned to die.</P>
<P>I asked the Father, whether there were none left of the Race of the la&s;t Kings that reigned in <HI>China.</HI> For Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dati</HI> &s;aid, that &s;ome affirm that a Son of the former King of <HI>China</HI> had e&s;caped into an ad|jacent I&s;land where he doth now live.</P>
<P>The Father a&s;&s;ured us, that if we did but con&s;ider where that I&s;land was &s;ituate, that it was enough to convince us of the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hood of that report: For it is in the Oriental part of <HI>China,</HI> therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e the Prince was to pa&s;s and tra|vel many moneths through the whole Body of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Army, and conquered Territories, for they were come that way into <HI>China;</HI> which is a thing not po&s;&s;ible to be performed. The King his
<PB N="18" REF="11">Father that reigned then, was be|come effeminate by his la&s;civious behavior. He &s;eldom &s;hewed him|&s;elf out of his Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, more then once a year, leaving the Govern|ment of the Kingdom and Army, to 10000 treacherous Eunuchs that had called in the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who had &s;ubdued three whole Provinces, and be&s;ieged the City of <HI>Pekin</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ound about, before the King knew any thing of their attempts upon his Government.</P>
<P>This &s;udden approach and &s;ur|pri&s;e, ca&s;t him into &s;uch a de&s;pair, that he re&s;olved to die. In order to it, he writ with his own blood upon a Bu&s;quin of white Damask the&s;e words. <HI>God pre&s;erve the new King, let him not trust my Coun&s;el|lors, but let him take compa&s;&s;ion of my people.</HI> After this he hanged one of his Daughters, and then hanged him&s;elf under the door that leads into the Garden of his Pallace. The
<PB N="19" REF="11">Queen al&s;o died in the &s;ame manner, but her Son and another of her Daughters were taken by the <HI>Tar|tars,</HI> and &s;hut up in a pri&s;on where they died al&s;o.</P>
<P>We inquired of what Family were the antient Kings of <HI>China?</HI> and the Kings that now reign, of what Hou&s;e they are?</P>
<P>He informed us, that the antient Kings of <HI>China,</HI> were of the Family called <HI>Min,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Light.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dati</HI> replied, wherefore then doth Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his Hi&s;tory call their Family <HI>Taimin? Tai</HI> an&s;wered Father <HI>Grueber,</HI> &s;igni|fies Stock or Race; &s;o that the meaning of <HI>Taimin</HI> is the Race of <HI>Min,</HI> as we &s;ay the Race, or the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria,</HI> or the Hou&s;e of <HI>Arragon.</HI> But he told us, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> have no name to their Fa|milies, they are not di&s;tingui&s;hable, but by their proper names. The Father of this pre&s;ent King was cal|led
<PB N="20" REF="12"><HI>Xun-chi,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>The Son of Heaven;</HI> and this Kings name is <HI>Tun-min, A great Light.</HI></P>
<P>We de&s;ired him to tell us, how the King lives with his Wives, and what di&s;tinction he did put between their Children, and the Children of his Concubins.</P>
<P>At this que&s;tion, he an&s;wered al|mo&s;t in the words of the <HI>Canticles,</HI> Chap. 6. <HI>Sexaginta &s;unt Reginae &amp; octogint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">binae &amp; adole&s;centulo|rum non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">est num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rus.</HI> The truth is, the King hath fifteen Wives honor|ed with the title of Queen, they are not all equal, three of them are more e&s;teemed then the re&s;t?

The other Wives are more or le&s;s, according to the Kings plea&s;ure and humor; but it is certain, that there is never le&s;s then one hundred, they are all in the Guardian&s;hip of Eu|nuchs: But the Children of the&s;e Wives are all equal; he is looked upon to be the cheif, whom the King chu&s;eth as his Succe&s;&s;or. The King that reigns now, is the Son of a Concubine, he attained not to that honor for want of other Bre|thren, for he was preferred to five of his Brethren, Queens Sons, a little before his Father died; be|cau&s;e, when the dying King had called them before him, he did not look upon them as able to com|mand in cheif, and manage &s;o great an Empire. Therefore he ordered
<PB N="22" REF="13">this Man to be &s;eated in the Throne, and to be proclaimed King in his &s;tead, and his Mother to be decla|red Queen Regent, during his mino|rity, appointing him four Tutors or Governors, of whom the cheif is named <HI>Samni.</HI></P>
<P>I inquired afterwards, how they did bury their Kings?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, that they did ne|ver bury their Corps, but burn them according to the <HI>Tartarian</HI> fa&s;hion. The pile is not of Wood, but of Paper, it is almo&s;t incredi|ble, what a va&s;t quantity is imploy|ed, or rather wa&s;ted, in &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion: For they do not only burn his Body, but al&s;o all his Wardrobe, his Moveables, his Trea&s;ury, his Jewels; in a word, all that was u&s;e|ful to the decea&s;ed, or that was de|&s;igned for his &s;ervice, the living Animals only excepted. Twelve Elephants bridled, and richly har|na&s;&s;ed, loaden with <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Stones,
<PB N="23" REF="13">meral ds, Saphirs, and all manner of jewels of an ine&s;timable price; three hundred Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es, and one hun|dred Camels carried the Kings Trea|&s;ure at the la&s;t Funeral. All this was unloaden, and put upon this Mount of Paper, erected to burn the Kings dead Body; when the fire had been put to it, the Gold and Silver did run from it in &s;treams, and force a way through the gazing multitude, who are not all idle lookers on; for &s;ome &s;eek to advantage them|&s;elves with the &s;poils of the de|cea&s;ed: But there is a great care taken to prevent &s;uch kind of vio|lences and &s;tealth, by the watchful|ne&s;s of the Guards, and by the grie|vous puni&s;hments inflicted upon &s;uch offenders. The <HI>Tartars</HI> are very &s;uper&s;titious in this re&s;pect, and careful to con&s;ume to a&s;hes the very Bones, and not &s;uffer &s;o much as the bigne&s;s of a Pins-head to re|main; the Gold and the Silver that
<PB N="24" REF="14">is left, after the burning, is &s;pent, to provide more Paper in &s;uch a ca&s;e, and to burn again the relicks of the dead Body, for the Souls &s;ake. At the la&s;t Funeral, when the expence of Paper was reckoned up, it a|mounted to no le&s;s then Seventy thou&s;and Crowns, and the whole Trea&s;ure that was there con&s;umed, to Forty thou&s;and Millions. Three of the Kings dome&s;ticks, a Privy Coun&s;ellor, a Chaplain, and a Con|cubine, devoted them&s;elves to at|tend upon the decea&s;ed Princes Soul, and follow him into another life, by &s;acrificing them&s;elves, a&s;&s;oon as the breath was out of his Body. They have always the liberty to chu&s;e what manner of death they like be&s;t, but commonly their Heads are cut off, which is the mo&s;t u&s;ual kind of death among&s;t the&s;e people to puni&s;h offenders, only Soldiers are &s;trangled. Be&s;ides the&s;e three Officers, many offer them&s;elves free|ly
<PB N="25" REF="14">to death, &s;ome out of affection for their King, others out of a &s;u|per&s;titious per&s;wa&s;ion, unto which their Religion inclines them. But in ca&s;e every one &s;hould refu&s;e to die, and none would be willing to wait upon the Princes Soul, they force &s;uch as he took mo&s;t delight in, and his deare&s;t &s;ervants to depart and follow after him.</P>
<P>I inquired next, in what did the Kings Revenue cheifly con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>He informed us, that the Fields and Countrey did properly belong to the Pea&s;ants, who out of the in|crea&s;e of their Fruits, pay about the tenth part to the King, and an|other part to the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to the Gentlemen that dwell in the Ca&s;tles; for they are the Lords of their adjacent Fields. This Revenue that belongs to the Crown, is very great; there is an|other that proceeds from all the Cattle of the Kingdom, out of
<PB N="26" REF="15">which, a tribute is gathered: Be|&s;ides, there are great Cu&s;toms upon Cattons and Rice tran&s;ported, and &s;everal Mines in the Province of <HI>Tunan,</HI> which &s;ignifies a <HI>Southerly Cloud.</HI> The&s;e Mines yield plenty of Gold, Saphirs, Emeralds, and all manner of precious Stones, that in|rich the Neighboring Kingdom of <HI>Pegu.</HI> There is al&s;o an unknown quantity of Silver brought out of the&s;e Cities, <HI>Quangh-ceu, Canton,</HI> and <HI>Nanquin,</HI> which are the cheif Mart Towns of all the Kingdom.</P>
<P>We asked him, if the King did often &s;hew him&s;elf publickly in the City? And how many Inhabitants may be in <HI>Pekin?</HI></P>
<P>He told us, that he was wont to cau&s;e the Soldiers of his Guard to be drawn up in Battalia, and exer|ci&s;e once every moneth, where he did commonly appear, to cau&s;e them to &s;hoot at a mark in the Mea|dows belonging to the City, be|tween
<PB N="27" REF="15">the Walls that incompa&s;s it; for it is &s;urrounded three times about, the uttermo&s;t Wall is the lowe&s;t, the two others are higher; the nearer they are to the middle of the Town. The Ditches are deep and full of Water; about the City there are many plea&s;ant Mea|dows. In one of them a great Sta|tue of Wood is erected, again&s;t which, the King appoints his Soldi|ers to &s;hoot either with Bow and Arrows, or with Powder and Shot; one is to hit the Hand, another the Head, a third the Bre&s;t. If the Soldier mi&s;&s;eth the fir&s;t time, he hath liberty to try the &s;econd, and the third; if he fails all three, with|out touching his mark, he receives a great many ba&s;tinadoes for his reward, and is disbanded as un|worthy of his Kings &s;ervice. In the whole City of <HI>Pekin,</HI> there cannot be le&s;s then a Million of Inhabitants, &s;ome &s;ay that there have been here|tofore
<PB N="28" REF="16">Nine millions: But that is not credible, for the City is not &s;o extraordinary large, and their Buildings are but of one &s;tory high.</P>
<P>We de&s;ired to know, how they did cover their dwellings?</P>
<P>He informed us, that they did cover them with Tiles, the Coun|trey Hou&s;es have no other covering The Tiles of the Kings Pallace are of various colours, of yellow and marble, very plea&s;ant and beautiful when they are looked upon at a di&s;tance: When the Sun &s;hines up|on them, they appear as if they were all of Gold.</P>
<P>We inquired, what Religion the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> did profe&s;s?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, that they did pro|fe&s;s Idolatry, that they were all I|dolaters in their hearts, wor&s;hip|ing &s;everal Idols in private. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> we con&s;ider only their outward profe&s;&s;ion, there are three differing
<PB N="29" REF="16">Sects. The fir&s;t is of the Learned, that profe&s;s to wor&s;hip a &s;uperior Being, named in their Language <HI>Sciax-ti.</HI> The&s;e two words are en|graven upon Tables of Gold, hung up in their Temples; unto them they offer Sacrifice, by burning be|fore them Paper gilded with Gold or Silver; together with &s;ome &s;mall round Balls made with Storax and Frankincen&s;e. But although they make profe&s;&s;ion of this Religion, which appears more plau&s;ible then the re&s;t; it is only outwardly, that they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> a &s;ort of men come out of <HI>China</HI> into <HI>India,</HI> extreamly &s;uper|&s;titious, exceeding all others in Idolatry, and fond Conceits; at fir&s;t they were in &s;ome good repute among&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es;</HI> as it common|ly happens when any new Sect ap|pears that is not known. The Do|ctrine which they publi&s;hed of the Tran&s;migration of Souls, which is
<PB N="30" REF="17">not altogether like that of <HI>Pytha|goras,</HI> got them the peoples e&s;teem, and procured them the envy of the Learned: So that they, in time, oppo&s;ed the progre&s;s of this new Sect, more out of di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t it, then out of love for their antient Religion. Therefore they have &s;o well publi&s;hed and e&s;tabli&s;hed the wor&s;hip of their <HI>Sciax-ti,</HI> that the Religion of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> is out of fa&s;hi|on and date, and hath lo&s;t all its credit; and they them&s;elves are looked upon no better then cheats. Now all over <HI>China,</HI> there is no kind of people more exclaimed again&s;t and decided; nor is there any Pro|fe&s;&s;ion more ridiculous then that. A man of credit &s;corns to exchange a word with them in publick, or to be in their company, unle&s;s it be in &s;uch occa&s;ions as are not to be a|voided; as in Funerals, publick Sa|crifices, Proce&s;&s;ions, where the&s;e Idolatrous Prie&s;ts are mercenary,
<PB N="31" REF="17">and hired to attend. The Nobility cau&s;e them to go in Proce&s;&s;ion in nuptial Solemnities, at the birth of their Children, and &s;uch like times. Their Proce&s;&s;ions are preceded by &s;everal In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, and attended with Banners, and di&s;|played En&s;igns, which they carry about their Idols; who&s;e prai&s;es they &s;ing in Songs and Hymns, and to whom they burn Paper and Fran|kincen&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Sect is the mo&s;t nume|rous, for it con&s;i&s;ts of the Citizens, of the Nobility, of the People and Pea&s;ants; in a word, of all manner of People. The&s;e pay their Devo|tions to the Souls of their Ance&s;tors, unto whom they Sacrifice continu|ally in their Temples; and in their private Hou&s;es, by burning Paper and Frankincen&s;e. All over the Countrey, this is the ordinary Sa|crifice which is offered to the good and evil &s;pirits every morning, be|fore
<PB N="32" REF="18">they go out of their doors. The third Sect is that of the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> who are mo&s;t abominably &s;uper&s;titi|ous.</P>
<P>We inquired, what the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> did believe of Mans e&s;tate after Death?</P>
<P>They believe, an&s;wered he, that we &s;hall be all happy, that we &s;hall be inriched with more wi&s;dom, and delighted with more plea&s;ure then in this life; but they proceed no further to particulari&s;e how the&s;e advantages &s;hall happen to Men. The Soul they believe to be immor|tal: But replied Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dati,</HI> if they believe that all &s;hall be hap|py in another World, how comes it to pa&s;s, that they are not thereby en|couraged to indulge them&s;elves in all manner of Vices? Nothing hin|ders, an&s;wered the Father, but the fear of pre&s;ent puni&s;hment. Yet they have &s;ome light per&s;wa&s;ions of Hell, where the Souls of the wicked
<PB N="33" REF="18">&s;hall be tormented; but they have found a way to get them out of tho&s;e Tortures. You mu&s;t know, that at <HI>Pekin,</HI> and in every con&s;iderable Town, there is a great Temple e|rected, unto which, above three hundred little Chappels belong; every Trade hath one appertaining to it, and not only the Trades, but al&s;o every order and rank of Men, from the Magi&s;trate to the Beggar. Now their per&s;wa&s;ion is, that the Spirit that is to vex the Soul of the wicked man, decea&s;ed, haunts the Chappel appropriated to that Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, unto which he did belong: For example, a Theif or a Robber &s;hall bring a &s;mall gift to the Theifs Chappel, to ingratiate him&s;elf with, and appea&s;e the di&s;plea&s;ure of that Spirit that puni&s;hes Theft and Rob|bery, that he might &s;pare him when his Soul &s;hall fall into his hands. The Spirit makes no u&s;e of the gift, as you may imagine, but the <HI>Bonzi</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="19">that keep the Chappel: So is it with the re&s;t. This is a politick In|vention, very well contrived for two good purpo&s;es, by that means they free them&s;elves from the trou|ble&s;ome apprehen&s;ions of the fu|ture; and they cau&s;e a pack of Knaves to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, who otherwi&s;e would trouble all the World with their begging.</P>
<P>We asked the Father, whether among&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> there were any Religious Orders of Men?</P>
<P>To this que&s;tion he an&s;wered: There are no other Orders of Reli|gious Votaries, be&s;ides the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> who are mo&s;t wicked Varlets, and infamous for their unnatural love of Boys; they want not opportuni|ties to commit this abomination, for they are intru&s;ted with the tuition of the youth; they are as the Schoolma&s;ters of that Countrey. This &s;in is too common among&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as well as among&s;t the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es.</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="19">In&s;tead of abhorring it, they make publick Profe&s;&s;ion of it, by erecting Academies for that infa|mous purpo&s;e. This Vice hath &s;pred it &s;elf farther into <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> they are &s;o ba&s;e as to receive Boys in Mar|riage, and their Fathers them&s;elves, are not a&s;hamed to give their con|&s;ent, and appoint them a kind of Portion, as to their Daughters. A|mong&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> there are al&s;o Religious Votaries not much unlike the <HI>Bonzi;</HI> they have the care of the Sacrifices, and are attired with Yellow or Red Garments, that fall down as low as their heels, with large &s;leeves open. Some of them carry on their heads Paper Miters; but commonly their heads are un|covered; they march with naked feet, and all their habit is much like that which our Painters give to the holy Apo&s;tles. This Religi|ous Order hath many Convents of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Women, &s;ituated, for
<PB N="36" REF="20">the mo&s;t part, upon High Moun|tains, of an unea&s;ie acce&s;s. Out of the&s;e Mona&s;teries, they never go out, without the leave of their Superi|ors, and &s;eldom, unle&s;s it be to beg, and then the olde&s;t of them are ap|pointed. All the&s;e Nuns make Vows of perpetual Cha&s;tity, Poverty, and Obedience; their heads are unco|vered, and their hair is cut round, clo&s;e to their ears; their garments are like to that of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> in &s;hape; but they are of a red colour, that of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> is gray.</P>
<P>We inquired of the Sciences pro|fe&s;&s;ed among&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>They have, &s;aid the Father, the Works of <HI>Con&s;ucius,</HI> who is as much e&s;teemed among&s;t them, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> is among&s;t us. <HI>Confucius</HI> lived about Three thou&s;and years ago, he hath left them a <HI>Moral Philo&s;ophy</HI> mingled with <HI>Divinity</HI> and <HI>Natural Philo&s;o|phy.</HI> I have &s;een one of his Po&s;terity reckoned to be the Three&s;core and
<PB N="37" REF="20">third Man of his Race: He is very rich, and honored with the title of a Prince; for the Kings of <HI>China</HI> have always had &s;o great a re&s;pect for this Learned Man, that they have allowed that title of honor to his Grand-children. Be&s;ides the Works of <HI>Confucius,</HI> they are natu|rally inclined to the knowledges of Numbers; but their <HI>Geometry</HI> is very imperfect, for it teaches only the more ordinary and practical part: They are not in the lea&s;t acquainted with the Theory, nor with the mo&s;t excellent part of <HI>Geometry,</HI> as the <HI>Optick.</HI> From hence we may judge how little they excel in <HI>Painting</HI> and <HI>Architecture.</HI> They are mighti|ly addicted to <HI>Chyromancy, Meto&s;|copia, Magick,</HI> and &s;uch like Arts. And in Judiciary <HI>Astrology</HI> they e&s;teem them&s;elves &s;uper-excellent.</P>
<P>We intreated him to tell us next, &s;omething of their Language, and of their Writings.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="21">
<P>For their Language, &s;aid the Fa|ther, it is very poor, for it hath not above Four hundred words. All the Nouns are undeclinable, and the Verbs are imployed only in the In|finitive Mood. I an&s;wered him, Sir if you would but continue but eight days in this City, I am per|&s;waded that I could learn &s;o well the Language, that I might be taken for a Natural <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> The Father laught at my confident conceit, and returned me this reply. After &s;uch a &s;tudy of eight days, you might po&s;&s;ibly call a Man a Hog, in&s;tead of honoring him with the title of <HI>Sir;</HI> for all the &s;ignifications of the <HI>China</HI> Language con&s;i&s;t in the varia|tion of the accent, in the difference of the tone, in the a&s;pirations, and other alterations of the Voice, which are almo&s;t innumerable.</P>
<P>For example, <HI>Cin</HI> pronounced &s;im|ply, hath no &s;ignification. <HI>Ciunun</HI> pronounced by lengthning the pro|nounciation
<PB N="39" REF="21">of the <HI>u,</HI> and &s;harp|ning of the Voice, &s;ignifies <HI>Sir</HI> or <HI>Mon&s;ieur; Ciu</HI> pronounced in lengthning the <HI>u,</HI> and keeping the &s;ame tone, is a <HI>Hog; Ciu</HI> &s;poken &s;wiftly, or rather &s;hot in ha&s;te out of the Mouth, &s;ignifies a <HI>Kitchin;</HI> and <HI>Ciu</HI> made u&s;e of in the begin|ning of a &s;trong Voice, which di|mini&s;heth at la&s;t, &s;ignifies the <HI>Foot of a Stool.</HI> By this example you may &s;ee how one word may have five differing &s;ignifications. In like man|ner <HI>Tien,</HI> pronounced plainly, hath no meaning. If it be &s;poken &s;harp|ly, &s;o that it makes <HI>Ti-en,</HI> it will &s;ignifie <HI>Sweet.</HI> If the <HI>(i)</HI> is accent|ed thus <HI>Ti-en,</HI> it means <HI>Bread. Ti-en</HI> uttered &s;peedily, &s;ignifies the <HI>Foot of a Table,</HI> or of a <HI>Bed.</HI> Mo&s;t part of the words in this Language are Mono&s;illables, and may be joyned together in a various manner. But this Art of Joyning the words, is very difficult, and not to be learn|ed
<PB N="40" REF="22">in an in&s;tant; but that which renders it more unea&s;ie to &s;trangers, is, That they have neither Cha|racters for their Letters, nor Alpha|bet; for they write all their Con|ceptions in Figures and Ciphers, that &s;ignifie every one of them two or three words, and many times whole Periods and Sentences; therefore they are forced to write the five &s;ignifications of the word <HI>Ciu,</HI> by five differing Ciphers, for want of Characters and Accents; whereas we might ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h them by the &s;everal Accents, which we might place variou&s;ly upon the &s;ame words. This is the Perfection of other Tongues, although the &s;ame word may have divers &s;ignifi|cations, we can ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h that which is proper to it in that place of the di&s;cour&s;e, where we find it by the words that go before, and follow immediately after.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="22">
<P>But to return to this wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>Ciu,</HI> be&s;ides the different Characters to expre&s;s the five former &s;ignifications. Suppo&s;e I intend to write <HI>Good mor|row Sir,</HI> I mu&s;t not make u&s;e of the Character that &s;ignifies <HI>good,</HI> nor that of <HI>Sir,</HI> but I mu&s;t write an|other Character different from all the former, which alone &s;hall &s;igni|fie all the&s;e three words <HI>Good mor|row Sir.</HI> Or &s;uppo&s;e that I am to write <HI>Yes Sir,</HI> I mu&s;t not u&s;e the Character of <HI>yes,</HI> nor that of <HI>Sir,</HI> but mu&s;t imploy another which will &s;ignifie alone <HI>Yes Sir.</HI> By this you may ea&s;ily judge what number of Characters are needful to write our Conceptions in this Language. Therefore it is more unea&s;ie to read it, then it is to write it; for when we intend to expre&s;s our mind in writing, it is only requi&s;it that we &s;hould under&s;tand the &s;ingle Cha|racters of words; for when they are joyned together, we may ea&s;ily
<PB N="42" REF="23">under&s;tand their meaning. But this manner of writing is not e&s;teemed, and only in u&s;e among&s;t the vulgar &s;ort of Men. But the Learned mu&s;t be acquainted, not only with tho&s;e &s;ingle Characters and Ciphers, but many others of a larger &s;ignificati|on: Some reckon them to be about Seventy four thou&s;and; who&s;oever knows any more then the re&s;t, is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t Learned, becau&s;e he is mo&s;t able to under&s;tand and read more Books.</P>
<P>From hence it is, that this Tongue is &s;o difficult to be learned; for as they have no Letters, they have no Dictionary to teach the meaning of the words; &s;o that there is no other way to learn them, but to hear them &s;poken, to ob|&s;erve the &s;ound and accent, and to imitate the Inhabitants by repeating them often, as the Parrots when they learn to &s;peak. The Je&s;uites have cau&s;ed a Catechi&s;m to be
<PB N="43" REF="23">Printed, and certain Dialogues; the one to teach the proper terms, that they might di&s;cour&s;e of the my&s;te|ries of our Faith, and make the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> under&s;tand them; the other is for the words mo&s;t common|ly u&s;ed in a familiar conver&s;ation: Nine thou&s;and Characters which are in that Book, are &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This account of the <HI>China</HI> Lan|guage di&s;couraged me, and took me off from my incon&s;iderate de|&s;ign of learning it in &s;ix days. When I feriou&s;ly think upon it, I cannot conceive how mans life can be long enough, for any to attain to a per|fect knowledge of &s;o many Ciphers, to under&s;tand them, when they are placed together, and to remember their different &s;hapes and &s;ignifica|tions. I have &s;ought out a familiar example, to make me conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of ma&s;tering the difficul|ties of &s;uch a &s;tudy. I remember
<PB N="44" REF="24">the Figures that are imployed in the Demon&s;trations of <HI>Geometry,</HI> may &s;erve very well for this purpo&s;e; for although the&s;e Figures be in|tangled in Lines, Triangles, Squares, Circles, and many &s;uch Figures which are made by the cro&s;&s;ing and meeting of the &s;everal Lines; ne|verthele&s;s, at the fir&s;t view, I under|&s;tand not only that which is demon|&s;trated, at la&s;t, by the&s;e differing Lines; but al&s;o many other Truths, which mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity appear, be|fore all the Lines can be drawn by a great many former Figures that enter into my mind, though they appear no more in that Figure and Demon&s;tration which they finally compleat: For all tho&s;e Figures and Truths are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated. There is yet another difficulty in this example; the Figures of <HI>Geo|metrical Demon&s;trations,</HI> are to be looked upon variou&s;ly, as a &s;trait
<PB N="45" REF="24">Line is &s;ometimes the <HI>ba&s;is</HI> of the Triangle, &s;ometimes the Diameter of a Circle, or part of an Oval, or as the right &s;ide of a Parabole, or as the <HI>Latus tran&s;ver&s;um</HI> of another. This con&s;ideration cau&s;ed me to ad|mire, the more, Mans ingenuity, and to conceive a po&s;&s;ibility of writing and under&s;tanding the Characters of the <HI>Chine&s;es;</HI> for our skilful <HI>Geo|meters</HI> who are well acquainted with all the Figures of <HI>Euclides</HI> and <HI>Archimedes, &amp;c.</HI> And that are able, of that Truth that is thereby proved, and to gather from thence a great many other con&s;e|quences that are deduceable, &s;eem to perform &s;omething more difficult then the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who are only to di&s;cover the meaning of certain Fi|gures imprinted in their minds, by a long continuance and u&s;age; for it is po&s;&s;ible in the whole cour&s;e of our
<PB N="46" REF="25">life to attain to a familiarity with them all.</P>
<P>The Father <HI>Grueber</HI> told us of their Marriages, that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> when they came to nineteen years of age, or thereabouts, commonly e&s;pou&s;e a Woman that is reckoned as their only and lawful Wife; they receive with her a Portion in Marri|age, according to their E&s;tates; but it is always in their power, to put her away by returning her Portion to her again. When a Father de|livers his Daughter in Matrimony, he never expects to &s;ee her again, he &s;huts her up in a clo&s;e kind of Sedan. When he hath locked her in, he delivers the Key to the good Woman, by who&s;e Mediation the Marriage is con&s;ummated; for there are &s;ome who make it their Profe&s;&s;i|on and Trade, to deal in &s;uch kind of Wares. The Woman &s;he delivers the Key to none but to the married Man, who is not to open it, and
<PB N="47" REF="25">free his Bride from her pri&s;on, but when &s;he is brought into the Nupti|al Chamber. When the Virgins of the Nobility go abroad, they are carried in Litters by Hor&s;es or A&s;&s;es covered over with a Vail, the re&s;t march on foot with their faces al&s;o hid; all kind of Women appear in this manner in publick. He told us afterwards, that when any Man hath taken a Wife, he is at his liberty to entertain as many Con|cubines as he plea&s;eth, of whom there are two &s;orts, &s;ome free, others &s;laves: The free are de&s;cended of Gentlemen, or other Per&s;ons well qualified, who to free them&s;elves from the burden of &s;o many Chil|dren, which they have by their many Concubines, are ready to part with their Daughters upon that ac|count for &s;mall &s;ums of Money, which they never re&s;tore again to the Men, when they divorce or &s;end them away. All the Children re|main
<PB N="48" REF="26">&s;till with the Father, unle&s;s he plea&s;e to allow a yearly Pen&s;ion to them and their Mothers. The Con|cubines that are &s;laves, are common|ly the Daughters of the meaner &s;ort of people, they part with them for the &s;ame rea&s;on as the Gentlemen do with theirs: They bring their Children to the Market-place of the City to &s;ell them; Daughters to &s;erve as Concubines, and the Boys as Servants; but they commonly drowned all &s;uch Children, Males and Females as are crooked or mi|&s;hapen at their Birth, or when they are otherwi&s;e deformed. For fifteen crowns any man may chu&s;e the mo&s;t beautiful Girls of the meaner &s;ort to be his Concubine; but their con|dition is mo&s;t mi&s;erable, for they are forced to carry water, and to drudge about the lowe&s;t offices of the family: When their Ma&s;ter de|&s;ires to enjoy them, they cannot re|fu&s;e him; for they were bought for
<PB N="49" REF="26">that purpo&s;e; and although they may be of as good Family as him&s;elf; if they are taken in Adultery, they commonly loo&s;e their heads. The Catholick Prie&s;ts make u&s;e of the&s;e meaner Concubines, to in&s;inuate the My&s;teries of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> into the minds of the other Women, and to teach the Children of the Noble&s;t Families. They have been by this means &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that many of the&s;e Women are become Converts, but they do not think it convenient to baptize them, in regard of that obligation that lies upon them, to grant to their Ma&s;ters all the liberty that they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Catholick Religion is there freely profe&s;&s;ed all over the Empire, without let or hinderance. In every one of their Churches, a Copy of the Kings Mandate, by which he grants a free exerci&s;e of our Religi|on, is graven in a Stone, and hung up in an eminent place, in the view
<PB N="50" REF="27">of the Congregation. <HI>Christians</HI> are very well e&s;teemed of in all the Provinces of <HI>China;</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> as well as the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> have liberty to turn <HI>Christians,</HI> and imbrace the Catholick Faith. The Learned Men of the Countrey, are familiarly ac|quainted with our <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary Prie&s;ts;</HI> the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition that they meet with, is from the Idolatrous <HI>Bonzi.</HI> The Father told us, that he had left in <HI>China</HI> &s;ix and twenty Je|&s;uites, four at <HI>Pekin,</HI> &s;ix <HI>Jacobins,</HI> and two bare-footed <HI>Carmelites.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> wear the &s;ame habit as the Learned of the Coun|trey, a long garment of white Da|mask that reaches to the ground. Father <HI>Adam Schall</HI> is one of the four <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary Je&s;uites</HI> in this City, he hath lived forty five years in <HI>China,</HI> and is very well e&s;teemed of the Prince and People.</P>
<P>We inquired what kind of Coyn
<PB N="51" REF="27">or Money, and what Weights the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> u&s;e?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That they had but one &s;ort of Coyn Printed, named <HI>Cuxa,</HI> of very ba&s;e mettle, each of them is worth about a farthing; upon one &s;ide is the Kings name, up|on the other, the name of the Coyn. Three hundred peeces of this money make a <HI>Lexu,</HI> which is worth about a Crown; they divide the <HI>Lexu</HI> in ten <HI>Ziens,</HI> in eight <HI>Fueus,</HI> and every <HI>Fueu</HI> in ...... <HI>Cuxas.</HI> They u&s;e in|&s;tead of Money, both Gold and Silver pieces, which they cut off as they &s;pend; for that purpo&s;e, they carry in their Boots, and about them, Seales and Cizers.</P>
<P>The Pound weight of <HI>China</HI> is &s;ixteen of our ounces. They mea|&s;ure by a cubit: All kind of Victu|als is very cheap, as well as their cloathing; for five <HI>Fucas,</HI> which are five of our pence, one may buy a very large Hen; by that any may
<PB N="52" REF="28">judge of every thing el&s;e that is &s;old, at a proportionable rate.</P>
<P>We asked him concerning their Meat and Drink.</P>
<P>He told us, that they had no Wine, although their Countrey af|fords excellent Grapes. The <HI>Euro|peans</HI> &s;ometimes make Wine with them, which the Inhabitants like very well, but they dare not drink of it, but in private, for this proud Nation have a Law in force to puni&s;h &s;everely all &s;uch as &s;hall bring in new modes of living. Their or|dinary drink is <HI>Th&eacute;,</HI> and Wine made of Rice; they extract it doubtle&s;s by the Limbick and the Still. It is not certainly known how they do it, for they will not di&s;cover the &s;ecret of any of their Arts to &s;trang|ers, unle&s;s they &s;wear fir&s;t to profe&s;s it, and it may co&s;t them their lives, if they fail afterwards. They de|light to drink hot liquors for that purpo&s;e; they are always upon the
<PB N="53" REF="28">fire in ve&s;&s;els near their Tables. In Summer they ca&s;t a little quantity of Ice in their drink, which they &s;uffer to remain there only for a mo|ment, that the liquor may receive from it, in &s;o &s;hort a time, &s;ome|thing of its cold nature to cool the &s;tomach; but they quickly take it out again, that they might not loo&s;e the plea&s;ure of drinking it hot. They keep their Ice, as we do in <HI>Europe;</HI> it is &s;old about the Towns very cheap, they u&s;e it more to cool their Fruits, then their Drinks, for they delight to eat them very cold.</P>
<P>But to return to their liquors, Wine made of Rice, appears of a whitene&s;s, inclining a little to the Amber colour, and mixed with a Golden Yellow, very beautiful to the eye. It hath a very plea&s;ant ta&s;te, and &s;o delicious, that it &s;eems as good as the be&s;t Sack. The com|mon people drink out of Earthen
<PB N="54" REF="29">Ve&s;&s;els, but the rich and noble are provided with Golden and Silver, adorned with ordinary Workman|&s;hip. The greate&s;t Lords u&s;e drink|ing Ve&s;&s;els made with the Horns of a <HI>Rhinocerot,</HI> imbelli&s;hed in a cour&s;e manner, inriched with Gold, and &s;ometimes with Diamonds. For their Meats they have all kind of varieties, as we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> of Veni&s;on, and of Fowl, of all man|ner of Fruits and Pul&s;e. Their Spi|ces are better then ours, for they are nearer to the <HI>Molucas.</HI> Their Wheat is very good, they can make Meal of it, but they have no skill to knead it into Bread; therefore in lieu of that, they u&s;e Rice which hath &s;oaked in the Water, and been parched and dried afterwards at the fire. This they take and carry to their Mouths, with long &s;ticks that &s;erve them in&s;tead of Forks. In their left hands they are commonly provided with a Porringer full of
<PB N="55" REF="29">this Rice, which they u&s;e in&s;tead of Bread, taking it out with their &s;ticks at every bit of Meat. They have no skill, nor ta&s;te to &s;ea&s;on their Meats well: In the &s;ame Pot they boil Pork, Hare, Fi&s;h, Veal, and Phea&s;ant together; and their be&s;t Cooks are continually pouring in abundance of Water, while they are boiling. When they are &s;odden, they fill their Porringers and Di&s;hes with this mad <HI>Oleo Podrido,</HI> which &s;erves them in&s;tead of Pottage. The mo&s;t ordinary Fle&s;h that they feed upon is Pork; their Mutton is in good e&s;teem among&s;t them. The poorer &s;ort eat A&s;&s;es, Dogs, Cats, and &s;uch like things, which they buy in Shambles, appointed for all kind of Fle&s;h. The dried Legs of Dogs, well and curiou&s;ly &s;moaked as we do our Neats Tongues, is a bit very &s;avory to them; they commonly re&s;erve it for their de&s;&s;ert and la&s;t mor&s;el at dinner; they
<PB N="56" REF="30">e&s;teem it a great fortifier of the &s;tomach. They bring every kind of Meat &s;everally in di&s;tinct Di&s;hes, but they have but two &s;orts of Saw|ces to encourage and provoke appe|tite. The fir&s;t is a kind of Pa&s;te made with &s;mall Beans in this man|ner; they beat the Beans &s;oaked in Water, and then &s;tir them well to|gether in the Water; when upon the top there appears a thin cover|ing, or green skin, they &s;train all through a Linnen cloath into clean Water; the fine&s;t &s;ub&s;tance runs through, but the skins remain be|hind. This they u&s;e in&s;tead of Sawce to all their Meats, and in&s;tead of Salt al&s;o; for they never &s;alt them otherwi&s;e, although they want not Wells and Fountains of Salt and Bracki&s;h Water in all the We&s;t|ern Provinces. The other Sawce is named <HI>Mi-&s;&s;o,</HI> which is made of a rotten Grain that yields a mo&s;t noy|&s;ome &s;mell; they do not boil it
<PB N="57" REF="30">with the re&s;t of their Meats, but they put it by it &s;elf in Sawcers; and when they are at dinner, they dip their mor&s;els of Meat in this &s;trong and filthy Mu&s;tard. At their Fea&s;ts, and at the Tables of their Nobles and Lords, they garni&s;h their Di&s;hes variou&s;ly, but ordina|rily with Rice, Herbs, or with hard Eggs, minced &s;mall and fried. When their Cooks have &s;hewn all their art and skill in &s;uch occa&s;ions, it is no light puni&s;hment to condemn a Man of <HI>Europe,</HI> to carry thither an empty &s;tomach: Therefore when &s;trangers are invited, they provide them&s;elves with a good dinner be|fore hand, for they are certain to meet with nothing there fit for their appetites.</P>
<P>Their Tables &s;tand round about the room where the Fea&s;t is to be held, never above two or three are together at the &s;ame Table, the Ma|&s;ter is wont to &s;it alone at the lower
<PB N="58" REF="31">mo&s;t. They u&s;e no Table-cloaths, but cover them with as many nece&s;|&s;ary uten&s;ils, as there &s;hould be per|&s;ons at the Table: The&s;e uten&s;ils are a di&s;h to drinkin, a Plate of Rice, another of their dainty <HI>Mi-&s;&s;o,</HI> and two of the&s;e Sticks, that &s;erve them in&s;tead of Forks. All their Di&s;hes are of Porcelane, the Kings as well as the meane&s;t Subjects, with this difference, That the one is of a finer &s;ub&s;tance then the other. When the invited gue&s;ts are &s;eated, an Officer u&s;hers in the fir&s;t &s;ervice; and when all the Tables are furni&s;hed, he makes a &s;ign to all to begin to eat. If any &s;hould offer to touch the Meat before he hath given the &s;ig|nal, he would be &s;everely checked, and looked upon as a Clown or an impatient Glutton. The &s;ignal or liberty of eating, is given by &s;aying to them all <HI>Zin,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>I in|vite you;</HI> then the gue&s;ts all an&s;wer, <HI>Zin, zin, zin,</HI> repeating this word
<PB N="59" REF="31">three times, as the <HI>Italian</HI> Prie&s;ts do the word <HI>Peace,</HI> when they &s;alute and embrace one another. After this, they all carry their hands to their &s;everal Di&s;hes together, and the Meat to their Mouths; and if any do not eat at the &s;ame time, as the re&s;t, the Officer calls upon them; for they think that the perfection of their Fea&s;ts con&s;i&s;ts in eating altoge|ther, otherwi&s;e they judge it to be out of order, and unhand&s;ome. When the Officer e&s;teems that they have &s;ufficiently eaten of the fir&s;t &s;ervice, he cau&s;eth the &s;econd to be brought in, and after that the third, ob&s;erving the &s;ame ceremonies and decency, as at the fir&s;t. Likewi&s;e, when he thinks it is time to drink, he invites them to it, in the &s;ame manner as he doth to eat; but they mu&s;t all empty their Cups. When they begin to drink the fir&s;t time, the Stage-players enter into the Room, &s;ome of them are common,
<PB N="60" REF="32">who play for Mony at every Hou&s;e, when they are hired, others are en|tertained by Noblemen; the riche&s;t have &s;everal companies of them, as the great Lords in <HI>Europe</HI> have Mu&s;icians. The&s;e kind of people are very richly cloathed; when they come in, they addre&s;s them&s;elves to him that &s;its at the highe&s;t Seat to &s;hew him their Book of Comedies, and to de&s;ire him to tell them upon what &s;ubject to play. He &s;ends them, out of civility, down to another, with their Book, which comes at la&s;t to the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, who commonly tells them to act what Comedy they plea&s;e. This Comedy la&s;ts about a quarter of an hour: The Subjects of the mo&s;t part of their Comedies, are taken from the Lives and Heroick Actions of their former Kings and Queens; when the Comedy is ended, the Officer enters in with other Di&s;hes of Meat; and when they are all taken away,
<PB N="61" REF="32">and have ended their drinking, the Comedians return again, ob&s;erving the &s;ame ceremony as before, to in|treat the a&s;&s;i&s;tants one after another, to appoint the &s;ubject, upon which they are to di&s;cour&s;e and act. When this &s;econd Comedy is fini&s;hed, the Officer comes again to give his at|tendance: Now this unplea&s;ant di|ver&s;ion la&s;ts &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even hours. I had almo&s;t forgot, &s;aid the Father, to tell you, that they have no <HI>Olives</HI> growing in <HI>China,</HI> therefore they make u&s;e of three other &s;orts of Oyl: The riche&s;t have an Oyl taken out of the Berries of Flowers of that Countrey, that grow upon Bryars: This is very &s;weet and plea&s;ant. I know not how they make it, but they have a great quantity of it; for their Land is as fruitful of &s;uch Bryars, as ours is of Nettles. The meaner &s;ort of people make u&s;e of another Oyl, extract|ed from a Grain which they call <HI>Tel|&s;elin;</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="33">it hath almo&s;t the &s;ame ta&s;te as the Oyl of <HI>Se&s;amum,</HI> a little bit|ter. The Countrey People, as in <HI>Poland,</HI> employ the Oyl of <HI>Line</HI> or <HI>Flax,</HI> or another kind of Oyl ex|tracted from a Plant named <HI>Ma-&s;en,</HI> which hath a mo&s;t odious and &s;trong &s;mell. They never eat any Sallads, nor other raw Herbs; many of their Fruits they pre&s;erve in Salt and Vinegar. In &s;hort they are not cu|rious in their ta&s;te and eating, but are filthy and unhand&s;ome. When we had a Phea&s;ant, or a Hair, we could not abide to &s;ee our <HI>China</HI> Cook handle and dre&s;s it; we were forced to &s;pit and dre&s;s it our &s;elves, and eat it in the mo&s;t retired Room, having fir&s;t forbidden the door to be opened to any that &s;hould come, unle&s;s it be to the Kings Officers. And that none might &s;urpri&s;e us un|awares, while our Meat was pre|paring, always one of us &s;tood Senti|nel at the Window, to give warn|ing
<PB N="63" REF="33">of any Mans coming up to us.</P>
<P>It is a very &s;trange thing &s;aid Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dati,</HI> that this Nation that hath &s;o many Sheep and Cows, have no skill to make Chee&s;e with their Milk, in any other manner, but with &s;mall Beans.</P>
<P>This proceeds, replied the Fa|ther, from their un&s;ufferable Pride; for they &s;corn to learn any thing, from &s;trangers, e&s;pecially from the <HI>Tartars;</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Tartars</HI> make Chee&s;e that is enough to cau&s;e them to abominate &s;uch a compo&s;i|tion; for that Nation. I could never make u&s;e of any of their Chee&s;e, nor of the Milk of the <HI>Chine&s;es;</HI> for both yield a mo&s;t odious &s;mell. The <HI>Tartars</HI> make their Chee&s;e of the &s;hape of our Cracknels, and hang them up with &s;trings, a great many together, at their Shops, to invite the hungry &s;tomach to buy them; they are &s;o grievous hard, that the
<PB N="64" REF="34">Flint Stones are not more. They are not to be eaten, but after they have been &s;oftned by the Fire, and molified as our Wax.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> are far more nice and curious in their &s;leeping, then in their eating and drinking. In Winter they &s;pred Cotten Mats upon little Furnaces, and &s;quare Stoves, named <HI>Ca&ugrave;,</HI> where they keep a very moderate Fire. Upon the&s;e Mats they lay very fine Sheets of Cotton, all their Linnen is of that &s;ub&s;tance; for they u&s;e their <HI>Line</HI> to make Oyl, and their <HI>Flax</HI> to twi&s;t into Ropes. At the four corners of their <HI>Ca&ugrave;,</HI> there are Pillars as at our Beds; at the top round, the Curtains are fa&s;tned, which they call <HI>Cai-&iuml;&agrave;.</HI> In Winter they are of Cloth, or of &s;ome other thick &s;ub|&s;tance; but in Summer they are of a very fine and thin Cotton, to keep off the Musketas. When the cold is over, they carry their Mats, and
<PB N="65" REF="34">lay them upon Boards or Tables; and in the heat of Summer, in&s;tead of Wool and Cotton, they fill them with a Sea weed, which when it is dried, is as &s;oft as Silk, and as light as Feathers: It is naturally very cool. Their Bol&s;ters and Pillows are very neatly made of the thinne&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t skins of Reed, which we call <HI>Indian Cane,</HI> in the manner of Hurdles. When the in&s;ide is emp|tied out, and &s;hut up clo&s;e, they are filled with wind, which yields in the hotte&s;t Sea&s;on much plea&s;ure. The head feels them to be very &s;oft, and never &s;inks deep; it is not buri|ed as in our Down-pillows, they are very &s;mooth. Their head are as though they were upon Springs, when they turn; and at the lea&s;t motion, they cau&s;e their Pillows and Bol&s;ters, to &s;end up a cold and fre&s;h Air to cool their faces, which is a notable advantage in the hotte&s;t nights of the Summer.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="35">
<P>Their Chairs are of the &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance, the Back and the Elbows are made of the Skins of <HI>Indian Cane,</HI> very commodious to &s;it down. The <HI>Tartars</HI> are not &s;o effeminate to make u&s;e of all the&s;e things, they &s;leep upon the bare ground as the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>We de&s;ired him to tell us &s;ome|thing of the Kings pomp, and of the magnificence of his Throne, when he appears in publick in all his grandeur.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured us, that the former Kings of <HI>China</HI> did delight in a great deal of glory and &s;tate; but that the pre&s;ent King of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who reigns now in <HI>China,</HI> is not &s;o cere|monious: He is content in his great|e&s;t &s;plendor, to &s;it upon a Carpet &s;pred on the ground.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dati</HI> de&s;ired to know from the Father, in what the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> were mo&s;t expen&s;ive.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="35">
<P>He an&s;wered, that they &s;pent much in their Funerals, in the great quantity of Perfumes and Wax, which they did there burn, in the making of Wooden Statues, in their Frankincen&s;e, which they did offer to the decea&s;ed, and &s;pecially in the rare Coffins, in which they put the dead Bodies. They are of pre|cious Wood, as of <HI>Aloes,</HI> of <HI>Yellow Saunders,</HI> or of &s;ome other <HI>Aroma|tick Wood</HI> of a great value: This &s;erves in&s;tead of imbalming.</P>
<P>We inquired of the goodne&s;s of the Air, of the Countrey, and how long the Inhabitants do commonly live.</P>
<P>The Air, &s;aid he, is very good every-where; therefore the Coun|trey people that are temperate in their diet, commonly live to be very old; &s;ome are one hundred years of age. The Nobility at forty &s;eem to be old, and when they &s;ee fifty, they begin to be cra&s;ie; this
<PB N="68" REF="36">difference proceeds from their de|baucheries with the Female Sex, and their immoderate eating, in which they pre&s;cribe no bounds to them&s;elves. Their Daughters &s;el|dom come to be thirty years of age, becau&s;e their Mothers are wont to tie and bind their Legs a&s;&s;oon as they are born; for they think all their beauty con&s;i&s;ts in crooked Legs, which is that part alone of their Bodies &s;een when they go a|broad.</P>
<P>This &s;trange and unnatural bending and tying of their Legs &s;o young, di&s;orders the Channels, through which; the nouri&s;hment of their Members pa&s;&s;eth, and &s;tops the Conduits, in &s;uch a manner, that neither their Legs nor their Bodies ever come to a perfect &s;tature and bigne&s;s; for by that means, the Blood is hindered in its ordinary circulation; and the complexion and con&s;titution of their Bodies be|ing
<PB N="69" REF="36">vitiated, it ha&s;tens them the &s;ooner to their Graves.</P>
<P>We de&s;ired him to tell us, which were their mo&s;t noted Fe&s;tivals?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered us, That they cheifly ob&s;erve three; the one at the fir&s;t New Moon in <HI>February,</HI> the &s;econd in <HI>November,</HI> and the third at the Kings Birth-day. In every one of the&s;e Fe&s;tivals, the King goes out of the City, attended upon by all the Nobility and Lords of the Court; by the Magi&s;trates, Officers of the Law, and by the Learned Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Every one wears an habit &s;uitable to his dignity and place. All their Garments are differing from one an|other, none but the King dares wear a Pearl alone at the top of his Gap. Many of the mo&s;t eminent Lords have precious Stones, and &s;ome Pearls; but always a Ruby, an Emerald, or a Ja&s;per, is put with it; for none but the King is to wear it alone. He wears al&s;o as marks of
<PB N="70" REF="37">his Royalty, two Storks embroider|ed with Silver upon his Bre&s;t. The <HI>Mandarins</HI> have other Animals: There are nine cheif differences, by which the Nobility is di&s;tingui&s;hed in their habits. The fir&s;t hath a Crane for his Badge, the &s;econd a Lion, the third an Eagle, the fourth a Peacock; I do not remember the re&s;t, nor what differences are to be noted in the Garments of their Ma|gi&s;trates and Learned Men. I only remember the Badge of the <HI>Mathe|maticians,</HI> they wear four little Squares of Ja&s;per, tied with &s;ilken &s;trings at their Girdles. In the mid|dle of the Squares there is a Ruby, and upon the top of their Bonnet, they bear a Ruby and a Pearl to|gether. The mo&s;t ordinary colours of their Garments, are Red, Blew, Orange mixed with Blew. We have already &s;aid, that their <HI>Bonzi</HI> are cloathed in Gray, and the Learned in White.</P>
<PB N="71" REF="37">
<P>I remember that at every Fe&s;ti|val ob&s;erved at the New Moon in <HI>February,</HI> every one is wont to melt or ca&s;t &s;ome piece of Mettle; upon which they repre&s;ent the Figure of a Cre&s;cent or New Moon; and they call this Fe&s;tival, <HI>The Sacrifice of the Hare.</HI></P>
<P>We inquired, Whether the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> had any Memorials &s;o antient, that give an account of the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;o many thou&s;and years ago, as &s;ome do affirm.</P>
<P>He told us, that they had no Hi|&s;tories more antient then King <HI>Tao,</HI> who lived about four thou&s;and &s;e|ven hundred years ago; and that they had no Hi&s;tories of antienter date, that &s;peak of the beginning and continuance of the World.</P>
<P>We put the Father next upon the Art of Navigation, to know whe|ther they believe in <HI>China,</HI> that there is any pa&s;&s;age out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>America;</HI> he a&s;&s;ured us, that they
<PB N="72" REF="38">had but little skill in Navigation; that they know not well how to make u&s;e of the <HI>Compa&s;s,</HI> or rather this knowledge is defective. Their greate&s;t Ve&s;&s;els are not able to carry above fifty Men, their Sails are made of Mat, but &s;o artificially, that they can go almo&s;t with any wind. Their rowing differs from ours, for they move their Oars be|fore and behind. Therefore as they have no great in&s;ight into the Art of Navigation, it is not po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould be able to adven|ture far at Sea, they dare not loo&s;e the &s;ight of the Land.</P>
<P>Concerning their pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>America,</HI> the Father told us, That he knew nothing certain, becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Holland|ers</HI> have been di&s;appointed in their attempting to pa&s;s through the <HI>Frozen Sea,</HI> where they have no manner of Trade: For the <HI>Tartars</HI> they are no great Traders, and it is
<PB N="73" REF="38">not probable, that any of them will venture upon a meer curio&s;ity, to open that pa&s;&s;age. It is not likely, that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> will leave their Countrey, to undertake any &s;uch hazardous voyage: Neverthele&s;s, it is generally believed, that there is &s;ome-where a pa&s;&s;age, or that <HI>A&s;ia</HI> is divided from <HI>America,</HI> but by a Narrow Sea. The continual ap|pearance of many wild Fowl of <HI>A|merica,</HI> in the Southern Parts of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> do very much &s;trengthen this opinion: For it is not probable, that they would there be &s;een, if <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Tartaria</HI> were not joyn|ed together, or not far from one an|other.</P>
<P>We asked him concerning the Dan|cings, Plays, and Gardens of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> replied the Father, never dance, but the <HI>Tartars</HI> u&s;e that &s;port among&s;t them&s;elves; the Men with the Men, and the Women with the Women; but never both Sexes
<PB N="74" REF="39">together.

<PB N="75" REF="39">Gardens are very green and delight|ful, becau&s;e of the conveniency of watering them with fre&s;h Rivers; but they have but &s;mall skill to dre&s;s and order them. All that I could take notice of, in &s;uch places, was in the Kings Garden, where is to be &s;een a great Ca&s;cade of Water, that falls from a Rock of Bra&s;s, covered all over with artificial Trees of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are extraordinary skilful in the Art of ca&s;ting Mettals; therefore their Ar|tillery is very beautiful.</P>
<P>We de&s;ired him to inform us of &s;omething concerning their other Arts, and cheifly concerning their Phy&s;ick and Phy&s;itians.</P>
<P>Their Phy&s;itians, an&s;wered the Father, are notable in di&s;cerning by the Pul&s;e, the nature and qualities of a di&s;ea&s;e; but their knowledge is not &s;o extraordinary in pre&s;cribing remedies, for they govern them&s;elves by gue&s;s, at all adventures, as our Phy&s;itians.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="40">
<P>I can &s;peak of both by experi|ence; for when I fell &s;ick, about forty days di&s;tance from the City of <HI>Pekin,</HI> one of the Kings Phy&s;itians vi&s;ited me, at the reque&s;t of Father <HI>Adam Schall.</HI> As &s;oon as he was come into my Chamber, he cau&s;ed me to &s;it down and &s;uffered me to re&s;t quietly a while. Afterwards he uncovered both my Arms as far as the Elbows, placing them upon a Table, and felt the Pul&s;es of both Arms, one after another; pre&s;&s;ing the Arteries &s;ometimes hard, &s;ome|times &s;oftly, &s;ometimes equally; and at other times he pre&s;t hard upon one Arm, leaving the other free: Sometimes he pre&s;t hard upon one Pul&s;e, and &s;oftly upon the other; he continued to feel it along while, a|non he felt it but by turns; &s;ometimes he cau&s;ed me to hold my fi&s;t clo&s;ed, anon he made me open it. In &s;hort, he felt and examined my Pul&s;e, as it did beat in every po&s;ture of my
<PB N="77" REF="40">Arm and Hand, which la&s;ted a long while, about three quarters of an hour. After all this, I had almo&s;t a mind to di&s;cover to him my di&s;|ca&s;e, but Father <HI>Adam</HI> interrupted me, and told me, that he knew it better then I did. When the Phy|&s;itian was &s;ate down, he de&s;cribed with a wonderful maje&s;ty my di&s;|ea&s;e, and all its properties and cir|cum&s;tances, a&s;&s;igning to them the time of their fir&s;t beginning, in &s;uch an exact manner, that I was &s;trange|ly &s;urpri&s;ed. He appointed me &s;ome Potions, but by the &s;mall advantage that I received from them, I found that he had been more skilful to gue&s;s at my di&s;ea&s;e, then to pre&s;cribe Remedies. They never let any man blood, as we do, but in&s;tead of that, they make u&s;e of Cupping-Gla&s;&s;es in the Shoulders: They cure the Pox very well, with certain mixture of Herbs; &s;o that this di&s;|ea&s;e is not &s;o mortal, in the&s;e parts,
<PB N="78" REF="41">as in <HI>Turky, Per&s;ia,</HI> and other Coun|treys of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies:</HI> They have among&s;t their Phy&s;icks a very fa|mous Root that grows, cheifly, in the Province of <HI>Sur-iven,</HI> they name it <HI>Tigers-Milk;</HI> for they &s;ay, That it never comes, but where the Milk of the &s;he <HI>Tigers</HI> hath moi&s;tened the ground, when they are furious and inraged by the pur&s;uit of Hunts|men. It is certain, that the &s;mell of this Root is very like the &s;mell of Milk, and its colour is white as Milk: They &s;ay, that when this Root is well prepared according to their skill, it is able to give an in|fallible &s;weat; it is true, I have &s;een the Root, but never the experiments of its vertues.</P>
<P>We que&s;tioned him afterwards, concerning the other Arts of the <HI>Chine&s;es;</HI> and the Father in the &s;ame order, as we had propo&s;ed to him, returned us an an&s;wer to every que&s;tion.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="41">
<P>That in <HI>China</HI> they have no Chry|&s;tal, but many Gla&s;&s;es, one &s;ort e&s;pe|cially, which they name <HI>Rice-Gla&s;s,</HI> it is more brittle then our Gla&s;&s;es, but ea&s;ier to work: For as &s;oon as the &s;ub&s;tance of it feels the heat of the Furnace, it melts; and they are not unskilful in handling it, for they make with it mo&s;t beautiful &s;hapes and fabricks. In&s;tead of Iron, they make u&s;e of great and hollow &s;taves of Gla&s;s, as our Enammellers in <HI>Europe.</HI> All their Looking-Gla&s;&s;es are very good; and as they have a particular Art in Melting and Ca&s;t|ing Mettals, they make many curi|ous Looking-Gla&s;&s;es in a Concavity, for a very &s;mall price; for a little above a peice, one may buy a Look|ing-Gla&s;s containing thirty two Thumbs in Diameter. The Je&s;uites have carried to them the Art of making Spectacles and Tele&s;copes. It is a wonderful thing that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have humbled them&s;elves
<PB N="80" REF="42">&s;o much, as to learn this skill from us. At pre&s;ent they do them very well, according to our patterns which the Merchants of <HI>Europe</HI> tran&s;port thither. Our Specta|cles of the larger &s;ize, is a gift well accepted of them; therefore the Merchants do not forget to furni&s;h them with this commodity.</P>
<P>They make excellent Stuffs with Thred of Gold, and with Golden Wire they make many beautiful Works: But they boa&s;t much of their Art in Gilding with Gold and Silver-Straw at the fire, in &s;everal manners; for with this gilded Straw they compo&s;e many rare and excel|lent Works. But I judge them to be mo&s;t ingenious, in their making of artificial fires with Gunpowder; for they cau&s;e them to repre&s;ent all kind of Shapes, Characters, Figures of Trees, and to appear in all man|ner of natural colours. I could never have believed from others re|lations,
<PB N="81" REF="42">what my eyes have con|vinced me to be true. I have &s;een at a Fea&s;t, a big Vine come down from the Roof of a large Room; and another fire after incompa&s;s it about, repre&s;enting its Leaves and Grapes &s;o perfectly well, and &s;o na|turally coloured, that a Painter could not have &s;hewn one more lively.</P>
<P>This appearance la&s;ted as long as we are repeating over our <HI>Mi|&s;ereri;</HI> when the combu&s;tible mat|ter was &s;pent, the artificial Vine vani&s;hed away, leaving behind a dark mi&s;t in every place, where any part of the Vine had appeared with its Leaves and Branches of Grapes. They have &s;omething of this Art in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but they cannot do &s;uch wonderful feats as in <HI>China,</HI> for here they care not to communicate their skill: The expence is not ex|traordinary, for forty &s;hillings any man may have a fire repre&s;enting
<PB N="82" REF="43">three or four &s;hapes. At the&s;e words I in&s;tantly replied to Father <HI>Grue|ber.</HI> You make me now believe, what I could never credit before. About eleven years ago, I met at <HI>Rome</HI> with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Se&s;tel,</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> who told me, that &s;ome of his Friends had written to him from <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> that a <HI>Dane</HI> being re|turned out of <HI>China,</HI> had &s;hewn the King an artificial Fire that ro&s;e up into the Air, and bur&s;t out into many flames, which repre&s;ented the Kings name. The Father replied, You may &s;afely believe it; but I wonder how this man could come to under&s;tand the my&s;tery, which he could never have been able to put in practice, unle&s;s he had tried it before, and taken an Oath re|quired in all &s;uch occa&s;ions, I wonder al&s;o, how he could e&s;cape out of the Countrey after &s;uch an Oath.</P>
<PB N="83" REF="43">
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dati</HI> asked, Whether they u&s;e any Coaches or Chariots?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are carried in Litters by Mules, or by Men; they are like ours, but &s;omewhat longer; for they put in them, their Cloaths, a Bed, a Table, and other conveniencies for a Tra|veller. The <HI>Tartars</HI> have Coaches, with two Wheels, drawn by one or two Mules or Hor&s;es. The Ladies of Viceroys, or of other eminent Lords, are drawn by two of the&s;e Bea&s;ts, and incompa&s;&s;ed about with a great many <HI>Tartarian</HI> Women on Horsback, Armed with Bow and Arrows. They carry their Bag and Baggage upon Camels backs, and up|on a kind of carriage that hath but one great Wheel that turns in the mid&s;t of two Trunks full of Stuff. One man draws this with a Girdle tied to his middle, and tied al&s;o to two Staves that are fa&s;tned to the Trunks, with which he governs
<PB N="84" REF="44">this Carriage at his plea&s;ure. They carry about their Wares and Com|modities through the Land, in this manner.</P>
<P>We asked him, Whether they de|light in Hunting? Whether they run Races? Whether they be good Hor&s;men? And, whether they have any skill to manage Hor&s;es?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That the <HI>Tartars</HI> are good Hunt&s;men, but the <HI>Chine|&s;es</HI> &s;eldom practice hunting: They know not what it is to run a Race; they are very careful and curious in harna&s;&s;ing well their Hor&s;es, but they do not know how to man|age them.</P>
<P>We de&s;ired to know, Whether they took any Tobacco?</P>
<P>To this he replied, That they take no Tobacco in Powder, but in Smoak; the <HI>Tartars</HI> and the <HI>Chine|&s;es,</HI> the Men and the Women are great takers of Tobacco. For that purpo&s;e, the Women are commonly
<PB N="85" REF="44">provided with a Bag that hangs over their &s;houlders, where their Pipe and their Tobacco is kept; but the Men carry their Pipes at their Gir|dles.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dati</HI> de&s;ired to know, Whether the word <HI>Mandarin</HI> be of <HI>China?</HI></P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That it was a <HI>Por|tugues,</HI> and that at <HI>China</HI> they are termed <HI>Quoan,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Prince, or a Governor.</P>
<P>We asked him concerning their Courage and Inclinations, to Mar|tial exploits and War.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured us, That they were Cowards, and that in three years time that he lived in <HI>China,</HI> he ne|ver could &s;ee above two people fight together at cuffs; for they have no other way to &s;atisfie their revenge, and end their quarrels.</P>
<P>We inquired of him, whether in his return he had not met with one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Mer|chant,
<PB N="86" REF="45">that was gone from <HI>Legorne,</HI> about two years &s;ince, into the <HI>In|dies,</HI> to carry thither a great deal of riches in Jewels; among&s;t the re&s;t, he had a &s;et of great Saphires, and of Pearls, as big as Pears, to make a Ro&s;e, which he intended for the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> to imbelli&s;h the Plume of his Elephant. I told him al&s;o, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> had &s;aid, That the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> did &s;pend e|very day Fifteen thou&s;and Crowns, only to keep the Elephants of the late King his Father. Therefore I de&s;ired him to tell us, whether we were to believe any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured us, That he had met with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and that I might credit what he had told me, and much more concern|ing the expence of this Prince to keep his Elephants.</P>
<P>That you may better under&s;tand the truth, you mu&s;t know &s;aid Fa|ther <HI>Grueber,</HI> That <HI>India</HI> beyond,
<PB N="87" REF="45">and on this &s;ide of the River <HI>Gan|ges,</HI> is divided into &s;everal di&s;tinct Regions or Governments, which are given by the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> to the Lords of his Court, during life, upon condition of paying every year a certain &s;um of money, as a Pre&s;ent or a Tribute. Be&s;ides that, they are al&s;o obliged to keep al|ways, &s;ome a thou&s;and, others two thou&s;and men on foot, others five thou&s;and, which may be ready to march at the Emperors command. By this means it happens, that the number of their <HI>Militia</HI> never di|mini&s;hes; and when the Prince comes to take a view of them, if the Soldiers be not well cho&s;en, and of a good appearance, well cloathed and armed, their Cheiftains are in danger of Bani&s;hment from Court. Therefore the <HI>Mogol,</HI> may upon a &s;udden, rai&s;e five or &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and men, ready for the encounter, without putting him&s;elf
<PB N="88" REF="46">to any extraordinary expence; for every Governor is obliged to have all his <HI>Militia</HI> ready, in all times of the greate&s;t Peace. Now you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that &s;ix or &s;even Ele|phants are kept purpo&s;ely to attend upon the per&s;on of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> they are named <HI>Pancia&s;ari,</HI> which &s;igni|fies <HI>Lords of Five thou&s;ands;</HI> be|cau&s;e the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> expends as much to keep them, as the Lords or Governors do, to entertain Five thou&s;and Hor&s;e in the Army.</P>
<P>By this you may judge, that what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> has told you, is very true. But you may take notice, that the <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;pends a great deal of this money in keep|ing fair Hor&s;es, as well as Elephants. They are richly harna&s;&s;ed and ador|ned with many precious Stones; the <HI>Mogol</HI> delights much to make them run Races.</P>
<P>He told us, that the pre&s;ent Em|peror in his young days, did &s;eem
<PB N="89" REF="46">to affect a retired life, &s;pending his time in contemplation. But &s;ince this crafty Hypocrite hath ca&s;t a|way his Mask, and pulled down his Father from his Throne, &s;hutting him up in a pri&s;on at <HI>Agra;</HI> the old man is about Eighty &s;ix years of Age: Only the fear of the Rebelli|on of his people, that did intirely love the Father, has hindered him from taking away his life. His pri|&s;on is a very large Palace, with many Buildings about it, and plea&s;ant Gardens. He is there guarded by a numerous Company of Muskettiers, and attended upon by his Women that are kept in an adjoyning <HI>Se|raglio,</HI> in which he &s;pends, for the mo&s;t part his time, and pa&s;&s;eth the melancholly thoughts of his retire|ment. The Emperor, his Son, cau|&s;ed a high Tower to be built near to this place, in &s;uch a manner, that it did overlook all the Gardens of his Father: Upon it he appointed a
<PB N="90" REF="47">Watchman to overlook and &s;pie out all that pa&s;&s;ed in the Pri&s;on; but the old man cau&s;ed him to be &s;hot and killed by a Company of his Women: Then he de&s;ired the cheif Commander of the Pri&s;on, to tell his Son, from him, that he &s;hould do well to &s;end &s;uch manner of Birds, and place them upon the &s;ame Tower, for they would give a great &s;port to his Women.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Mogol,</HI> or Emperor, is renowned for many examples of Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom, that are report|ed of him. It hapned when I was at <HI>Lahor,</HI> a Prince cau&s;ed the Groom of his Stables to be killed in a very barbarous manner, his head to be &s;truck through with a large Nail, for a &s;mall fault, for not having tended and dre&s;&s;ed his beloved Hor&s;e, as he &s;hould have done. When the Emperor was &s;itting in the Seat of Judicature, which he con&s;tantly doth every moneth, in a
<PB N="91" REF="47">day appointed for that purpo&s;e, in a great Meadow, out of the Royal City, the Grooms or Farrier Wife made her complaints of the cruel ma&s;&s;acre of her Husband; the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;ent immediately for the Prince, and asked him, If it were &s;o as the Woman &s;aid; He confe&s;&s;ed his crime: Therefore the <HI>Mogol</HI> cau&s;ed him to be &s;tretched upon the Ground, and commanded the Wo|man, or the Farriers Widow, to deal with him in the &s;ame manner as he had dealt with her decea&s;ed husband. There are many other reports con|cerning the Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom of this Prince. He governs his King|dom very well, and cau&s;eth Ju&s;tice to be admini&s;tred, only to ingrati|ate him&s;elf with his Subjects, and prevent the tumults which they might otherwi&s;e be tempted to rai&s;e, becau&s;e of the cruel detention of his aged Father; for which unnatural deed, he knows that he is hated.</P>

<P>He is about forty years old, it may be when his Father &s;hall be dead, he will loo&s;e his pre&s;ent Mo|deration, and his forced Inclinati|ons now impri&s;oned, by the con|&s;iderations of Safety and Intere&s;t, may bur&s;t out and di&s;cover them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>In this manner Father <HI>Grueber</HI> an&s;wered to our Que&s;tions; we had a great de&s;ire to inquire of other Matters, concerning that remote Countrey; but in regard our con|ver&s;ation had la&s;ted many hours, and that much of the night had been &s;pent in this plea&s;ing di&s;cour&s;e, we thanked him for his great civili|ty, and withdrew to our Lodg|ings.</P>

<P>From <HI>Nesti</HI> they travelled in &s;ix days, to the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the King|dom of <HI>Nekbal,</HI> called <HI>Cadmendu,</HI> lying in twenty &s;even degrees and five minutes from the Pole. The King is a great Prince, and a Hea|then, but no Enemy to Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="51">
<P>From <HI>Cadmendu,</HI> in half a day, they went to <HI>Nekbal,</HI> the cheif City of the Kingdom, which is called al&s;o <HI>Baddan;</HI> and from thence, in five days, they arrived at the City <HI>Hedonda,</HI> belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>Maranga,</HI> &s;ituate in twenty &s;ix degrees and thiry &s;ix minutes from the Pole. From thence, in eight days, Travellers go to <HI>Mutgari,</HI> the fir&s;t City upon the confines of the Kingdom of <HI>Mogol.</HI> From <HI>Mutgari,</HI> they went to <HI>Battana,</HI> a Town of the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala,</HI> &s;ituate up|on the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> in twenty five degrees and forty four minutes. From <HI>Battana,</HI> in eight days, they came to <HI>Benares,</HI> a populous Town near the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> lying in twenty four degrees and fifty mi|nutes. It is a noted place, for there are the Schools of the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> where all the Sciences, profe&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e Countreys, are taught, and
<PB N="99" REF="51">with them, the mo&s;t abominable Su|per&s;titions.</P>
<P>From <HI>Benares,</HI> there are eight days journey, to <HI>Catampor;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Agra,</HI> &s;even more.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pekin</HI> to <HI>Agra,</HI> Men go in 214 days. But when they go no fa&s;ter then the <HI>Carravans,</HI> they are four|teen moneths in their journey.</P>
<P>This Relation I had from the Fa|thers of our Society, who gave me this account of their Journeys.</P>
<P>The&s;e Kingdoms were never known by any in <HI>Europe</HI> before, nor to the Geographers. In their pa&s;&s;age they took notice of many particu|lars concerning the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the &s;everal Inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pekin,</HI> the Imperial City of <HI>China,</HI> they travelled in two moneths to the famous Walls of that Coun|trey, where the great City <HI>Sining|fu</HI> is &s;ituate, as a &s;trong Bulwark again&s;t the <HI>Tartars</HI> inva&s;ions. They
<PB N="100" REF="52">took great notice of the Walls, that are as &s;trongly built, as the conve|niencies of that place will afford. This Wall is &s;o large, that &s;ix Hor&s;|men may ride upon it, in a bre&s;t, without hindering one another. They are often vi&s;ited by the In|habitants of <HI>Siningf&uacute;,</HI> to receive the benefit of the fre&s;h Air, which comes off from the Sandy Moun|tains of the Neighboring De&s;art; and to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in walk|ing and delighting their eyes, with the plea&s;ant Pro&s;pects; for they are &s;o high, that they di&s;cover the Countrey round about, and invite the Citizens to take a view of the delightful objects that appear be|fore them: There is a very ea&s;ie a&s;cent up to this high Wall.</P>
<P>Its length from this City, to the other Gate, by which Men come out of the De&s;arts into the Town of <HI>Sucien,</HI> is about eighteen days journey; many, out of curio&s;ity, as
<PB N="101" REF="52">well as out of nece&s;&s;ity of bu&s;ine&s;s, undertake this journey. For that purpo&s;e they get a Pa&s;sport from the Governor of <HI>Siningf&uacute;,</HI> and provide them&s;elves with &s;ufficient victuals. They &s;ay, that in this delightful pil|grimage, they may &s;ee an infinite number of dwellings in their way, in the <HI>China</HI> &s;ide, which they di&s;|cover as from a high Mountain; but on the other &s;ide, towards the great and &s;pacious Wilderne&s;s, as the Inhabitants have told them, there are all manner of wilde Bea&s;ts to be &s;een, <HI>Tigers, Lions, Elephants, Rhinocerots, Leopards, Wilde Bulls, Monocerots;</HI> this la&s;t &s;ort are a kind of <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> with Horns in their Fronts. The beholders may from hence, without fear of danger, plea&s;e them|&s;elves with many &s;trange and un|u&s;ual &s;ights of furious Bea&s;ts, e&s;pe|cially from that part of the Wall that is towards the South, in the mo&s;t inhabited places near to <HI>Quam|&s;i,
<PB N="102" REF="53">Junnam,</HI> and <HI>Tibet.</HI> From hence to the Yellow River, in the Coun|trey adjoyning to the Wall, the wild Bea&s;ts hunt together in Com|panies to &s;eek for food in the&s;e places that are full of Brambles and Bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>When the Fathers of our Society were gone out of this prodigious Wall, into the Neighboring Wil|derne&s;s, they found a &s;mall Stream of Water full of Fi&s;h, whereof they dre&s;&s;ed a great quantity in their Tent, and kep &s;ome for another time. When they were pa&s;&s;ed over the Yellow River which runs out of the Wall, they entered into that va&s;t De&s;art of <HI>Kalmak,</HI> full of un|fruitful Mountains, and Fields mo&s;t dreadful to behold; and in three moneths they arrived at the King|dom of <HI>Barantola.</HI></P>
<P>Although this Wilderne&s;s be &s;o &s;olitary, and uninhabitable, it is fre|quented by the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kalmuk,</HI> at certain times of the year, when
<PB N="103" REF="53">the Gra&s;s appears upon the &s;ides of the Rivers; then they tran&s;port their Portable Hou&s;es or Tents, and pitch them in &s;uch numbers toge|ther, that any man would judge every company to be a City.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> take the liberty to march up and down, and plunder all that they can meet with; there|fore it is nece&s;&s;ary to be well armed again&s;t the violences of the&s;e Rogues, and to travel with a good <HI>Caravan.</HI> Our Fathers did often light upon &s;everal &s;cattered com|panies of them, as they travelled through this Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lamae,</HI> who are the Prie&s;ts of the&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kalmak,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hable by a Red Hat, a White Gown twi&s;ted behind, a Red Girdle, and a Yellow Tunick: At their Girdle there is a Pur&s;e that is fa&s;tned to it. They &s;ay, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kalmak</HI> are cloathed with Skins, and a Yellow Cap;
<PB N="104" REF="54">their Women with Skins, or with Green or Red Stuffs; every one of them hath a Charm and Characters hung about their Necks, to pro|tect them from evil &s;pirits and witchcraft. They lodge in the in|nermo&s;t Room of the Tent, made up with portable Staves, but the out&s;ide is covered with a thick Wollen Cloath and tied with Ropes. When their <HI>Lamae</HI> are at their Devotions, their Bigots, there pre&s;ent, roul about a Wheel, and handle it as a Scepter.</P>
<P>They have given the de&s;cription of <HI>Han,</HI> a decea&s;ed King of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> whom they &s;ay had fourteen Sons, and for his Goodne&s;s and Ju&s;tice in governing his Kingdom, the Inha|bitants have honored him as a god, in their Countrey fa&s;hion. He is &s;aid to have been of a Tawny coun|tenance, he had a Beard of a Che&s;|nut colour, and Eyes like unto Dogs-eyes, &s;welling out of his Head.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="54">
<P><HI>Tanguth</HI> is a large Kingdom of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> the&s;e Father-Je&s;uites have travelled through a great part of it.</P>
<P>At that time, in the Court of <HI>Dena,</HI> King of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> there was a Woman came from the Northern part of <HI>Tartary,</HI> that wore twi&s;ted Hair, in the manner of Ropes; her Head was adorned with Sea-&s;hells, and her middle bound about with a Girdle. In the &s;ame place, &s;ome of the Courtiers were habited as Wo|men, only their Cloaths were of a Red colour as their Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>Into the&s;e Kingdoms of <HI>Tanguth</HI> and <HI>Barantola,</HI> the Devils &s;ubtilty hath brought in a mo&s;t abominable and horrid cu&s;tom. They chu&s;e a &s;trong youth, &s;tout, and lu&s;ty, and give him liberty at certain times of the year, to kill, with the weapons, that he hath for that purpo&s;e, Men, Women, and Children, that he meets in his way; and when they are
<PB N="106" REF="55">killed in this manner, they imagine that they are con&s;ecrated to their godde&s;s <HI>Menipe,</HI> that they are in a mo&s;t happy e&s;tate; and therefore the living render to their memories, particular honors.</P>
<P>The youth is cloathed with a Garment of &s;everal colours, he is furni&s;hed with a Sword, with Bow, Arrows, and a Quiver; he carries &s;ometimes a Banner. At a certain &s;ea&s;on, he is tran&s;ported with Fury, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spirit, unto whom he is con&s;ecrated; he flies in|to the Streets, and rambles up and down; all that he meets, he kills, for none dare make him any re&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>This youth they call, in their Tongue, <HI>Buth,</HI> which word &s;igni|fies a <HI>Slayer.</HI> Whiles the Fathers were there, they had a &s;ight of him habited in that manner as he is al|ready de&s;cribed.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="55">
<P>In this large Kingdom of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> there are many Kingdoms included, fir&s;t, <HI>Barantola,</HI> which is al&s;o called <HI>La&s;&s;a,</HI> the name of the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Kingdom. It hath a King of its own, mi&s;erably addicted to Paga|ni&s;m. He wor&s;hips many Heathen Idols, among&s;t whom <HI>Menipe</HI> is one of the cheif. Its head ri&s;eth up as a Sugar-loaf, in a mon&s;trous manner. <HI>Kircherus</HI> hath promi&s;ed to publi&s;h a di&s;cour&s;e, more at large, of this and other Idols of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Before this Idol, the&s;e people per|form their Sacrifices with &s;trange ge&s;tures, often repeating this excla|mation, <HI>O Manipe mi hum, &ocirc; Ma|nipe mi hum,</HI> that is, <HI>Manipe &s;ave us.</HI> Be&s;ides, the&s;e fooli&s;h Idolaters bring to their Idol, to ingratiate them|&s;elves with him, all kind of Meats; and ob&s;erve many other abomi|nable practices of the antient Hea|thens.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="56">
<P>There is another Image of a fal&s;e God to be &s;een in <HI>Barantola,</HI> which is &s;o &s;trange, that &s;carce any body will believe it; therefore I &s;hall here give a more punctual account of it.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Fathers, <HI>Grueber</HI> and <HI>d'Orville</HI> affirm, that whiles they waited at <HI>Barantola,</HI> about two Moneths, until a <HI>Caravan</HI> was ready to march, they took great notice of the Peoples Manners and Cu&s;toms, whereof &s;ome were ridiculous, and &s;ome mo&s;t abominable.</P>
<P>In this Kingdom there are two Kings, the one is imployed about the Government of the Kingdom, and is named <HI>Dena;</HI> the other is re|tired from all worldly affairs; he lives idle in the &s;ecret Chambers of his Pallace, and is adored and wor|&s;hipped as a god; not only by the Natives, but al&s;o by all the Kings of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> &s;ubject to this King|dom; for they come to him in pil|grimage.
<PB N="109" REF="56">They name him their eternal and heavenly Father, and reverence him as the true and living God, by offering to him great pre|&s;ents. He &s;its in an ob&s;cure and dark place of his Pallace, adorned with Gold and Silver, upon a Bed rai&s;ed on high; under his feet rich Carpets are &s;pred, and round about him many Lamps &s;tand lighted. When &s;trangers come to him, they fall upon their faces, they creep to him upon their knees, and ki&s;s his feet, as the Papi&s;ts do the toes of their Pope, with a wonderful re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>From hence we may di&s;cover the Devils &s;ubtilty, in appropriating this ceremony and te&s;timony of re|&s;pect due to none on Earth, but to the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Here Mr. <HI>Je&s;uite</HI> &s;peaks as a Papi&s;t.</NOTE> to the barbarous Super|&s;titions of this Idola|trous Nation. He hath had the malice to transfer and u&s;urp all the other
<PB N="110" REF="57">my&s;teries of our Faith to his own Wor&s;hip. As the Papi&s;ts call the Pope, the Father of all Spiritual Fa|thers; &s;o the&s;e Idolaters call this Demy-God, <HI>The great Lama,</HI> or <HI>The High Prie&s;t,</HI> or <HI>The Lama of Lamas;</HI> that is, The Prie&s;t of Prie&s;ts: For all their Religion and Idolatry de|pends upon him; therefore they honor him with the title of <HI>Eternal Father.</HI> And that by his decea&s;e, his weakne&s;s and mortality might not appear, the Inferior <HI>Lamae,</HI> and other Prie&s;ts only are admitted to attend upon him, to procure him what&s;oever he &s;tands in need of, to receive his commands, and deliver them as Oracles of the Divinity to the &s;imple Pilgrims.</P>
<P>The&s;e men after his death, are wont to &s;eek another, as like him in feature and &s;tature as they can; him they lift upon the Throne. By this means the whole Kingdom, un|acquainted with the manner of the
<PB N="111" REF="57">deceit, firmly believes that he is ri&s;en again to them, from the dead, &s;even times; and that he &s;hall con|tinue for ever. This per&s;wa&s;ion is &s;o fixed in their minds, blinded with the Devils illu&s;ions and deceits, that there is none que&s;tions it. There|fore he is wor&s;hipped by all in a &s;ignal manner. Every one e&s;teems him happy indeed, who can prevail &s;o much upon the goodne&s;s of the inferior <HI>Lamae,</HI> his attendants, as to get &s;omething that hath but touched his body, or been taken from him, which they bear about their necks. For that purpo&s;e they load them with many rich gifts to obtain this their de&s;ire. O abomina|ble and filthy blindne&s;s! By the&s;e Relicks, they imagine them&s;elves protected again&s;t all manner of evils.</P>
<P>This the &s;aid Fathers under|&s;tood, to their great grief, from the Inhabitants of <HI>Barantola.</HI> It is true,
<PB N="112" REF="58">the Fathers did not &s;ee this great <HI>Lama,</HI> becau&s;e none is admitted that makes profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri|&s;tian Religion; and there are many previous Ceremonies full of Ido|latry to be practiced, before any man can be permitted to go near him, but they &s;aw his Picture at the Entry in of the Kings Palace; unto which, as much reverence is paid, when but repre&s;ented in Pictures and Images, as if he were there in per&s;on, by the&s;e Idolaters. His au|thority is &s;o great all over <HI>Tartaria,</HI> that there is no King that offers to take upon him his royal Scepter, but he &s;ends fir&s;t his Amba&s;&s;adors with rich pre&s;ents to the great <HI>Lama,</HI> to obtain his ble&s;&s;ing for his happy and pro&s;perous reign.</P>
<P>They &s;aw al&s;o at <HI>Barantola</HI> &s;ome &s;trange Women, of a Neighbor King|dom called <HI>Co&iuml;n,</HI> one old and the other young: Women of an anci|ent Nobility fold up their Hair in a
<PB N="113" REF="58">bundle, and ca&s;t them behind their backs. Upon their foreheads they wear a red Ribbon, adorned with Pearl, but on their heads a Silver Crown, in the &s;hape of a Box, em|belli&s;hed with <HI>Turkoi&s;es</HI> and <HI>Cor|ral.</HI></P>
<P>They arrived next from <HI>Baranto|la</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Nekbal,</HI> through a difficult way that leads over one of the highe&s;t Mountains of the World, named <HI>Langur,</HI> which we have already de&s;cribed. They found all things there needful to the life of Man, but only the knowledge of Chri&s;tianity; for the Natives are all involved in the thick mi&s;ts of the Heathens ignorance.</P>
<P>The cheif Towns are <HI>Cuthi</HI> and <HI>Nesti;</HI> the Cu&s;tome of the Inhabi|tants is, when any drink to Women, other per&s;ons pour into the Cup their liquor called <HI>Ch&agrave;,</HI> or Wine, three times, and ob&s;erve other ri|diculous ceremonies.</P>

<P>_THe <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monar|chies &s;eldom live long in Peace. Either the Intere&s;t of the Kingdoms, or the jealou&s;ies of State, or the humors of the People, or the na|tural aver&s;ions and animo&s;ities which they have received by inhe|ritance from their Forefathers, do frequently kindle the flames of War. Their Neighborhood and continual Conver&s;ation furni&s;hes them with many occa&s;ions of di&s;ta&s;tes and di&s;|putes;
<PB N="120" REF="62">for both the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> have no compliance nor re&s;pect for one another. They are naturally proud and high-minded, they pretend both to the Univer&s;al Monarchy, and think all the World mu&s;t bow and creep to their great|ne&s;s. I intend not to examine in this &s;hort Tract, the cau&s;es of their frequent Ruptures and Wars, I &s;hall confine my di&s;cour&s;e within the Borders of the <HI>French</HI> Domini|ons, where we mu&s;t vi&s;it the King and Court, and &s;ee what hath hap|ned worthy of our ob&s;ervation up|on that famous Theater of <HI>Europe.</HI> I de&s;ign not &s;o much to &s;atisfie the <HI>Readers</HI> curio&s;ity, as to furni&s;h him with that knowledge which he may improve to his advantage; for in every capacity true and impartial Hi&s;tory tends to our right informa|tion and direction, God by his pro|vidence teacheth men as well as by his Word. It concerns us not to
<PB N="121" REF="62">neglect the means that he affords for our in&s;truction. And there is no|thing more required in men that pretend to learning and perfection, then to be acquainted with the late and pre&s;ent Affairs, as well as with tho&s;e that we have received from our Forefathers Relations.</P>
<P>It is very ob&s;ervable, that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;eldom con|clude Peace without a Marriage. The old Fable of <HI>Mars</HI>'s Adultery or Conjunction with <HI>Venus,</HI> is a practice &s;o ordinary among&s;t them, that it needs no proof. In the year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fif|teen, the Polititians of both King|doms were re&s;olved to conclude their di&s;putes, and reunite their in|tere&s;ts in a Marriage between <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth, &s;irnamed <HI>The Ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Austria, Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> Both Kingdoms expected from the&s;e two hopeful Princes, a numerous po&s;terity; but to the
<PB N="122" REF="63">great di&s;appointment of their Sub|jects, and of all <HI>Europe,</HI> they lived together three and twenty years without Children. Succe&s;s follows not always our be&s;t endeavors. At la&s;t in the Moneth of <HI>September,</HI> One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred thirty and eight, the Queen was brought to Bed of a brave lu&s;ty Boy, who was &s;aluted and welcomed into the World by the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> with the name of <HI>Dieu-donn&egrave;, Given of God:</HI> For they were verily per|&s;waded, that his Birth and Concep|tion had been miraculous, in regard of the indi&s;po&s;ition of his Father. To &s;trengthen this per&s;wa&s;ion, the more by Cardinal <HI>Mazarines</HI> con|trivance, then the <HI>Factotum</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the King, the Queen, and the whole Court had been in Pro|ce&s;&s;ion, with much devotion, bare|footed, to the Chappel of the Vir|gin <HI>Mary,</HI> near <HI>Paris,</HI> to de&s;ire from her, a Son and Heir to the Crown o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="123" REF="63"><HI>France.</HI> Therefore the <HI>French</HI> look upon this Prince, as the effect and return of their Prayers, then &s;o|lemnly offered up to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; for within a year after, the King and Queen were ble&s;&s;ed with this hopeful Child, to the greater joy of <HI>France,</HI> then of &s;ome of the Blood Royal, who had promi&s;ed to them&s;elves the Kingdom, in ca&s;e <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth did die with|out i&s;&s;ue. Their di&s;contents remain|ed long concealed in private, and were not &s;uffered to break out into a Publick War, by the good order that the Cardinal gave to the Affairs of the Kingdom, and by their re|&s;pect for the King, then alive. But afterwards, when they &s;aw <HI>Lewis</HI> in his Grave, the People di&s;&s;atisfied, and the Grandees di&s;contented, with the <HI>Italian</HI> Government, they pro|claimed their di&s;plea&s;ures at the Head of an Army, with the loud noi&s;e of Drums, Trumpets, and
<PB N="124" REF="64">Cannon; as we &s;hall &s;ee by and by.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Dolphin</HI> was inau|gurated into his Principality, and initiated into Chri&s;tian Religion, they gave him his Attendants and Officers, according to his quality and Birth; the two cheif were his Governe&s;s &mdash; a Lady of a no|ble &s;pirit, and <HI>Hardouin de Perefixe,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and &s;ince removed to the Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>Paris,</HI> was his Governor and Tutor. He is a great Polititian, Wi&s;e, and Learned, very affable and courteous. Whiles he lay in his Cradle, we can find nothing wor|thy of our notice, but as &s;oon as he &s;tept out of it to walk alone, Pro|vidence waited upon him, to put into his hands a Scepter, before he could manage it: For at four years of age, and a few Moneths, his Fa|ther <HI>Lewis,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>The Just,</HI> de|parted this life, having publi&s;hed
<PB N="125" REF="64">before his Declaration, dated <HI>April</HI> 21. 1643. By which the Queen was appointed Regent, and Go|verne&s;s of the whole Kingdom, the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was her Lieute|nant, and cheif of the Council. The Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> decea&s;ed, the Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Se|guier,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI> Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Bouthillier,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cha|vigny;</HI> were to be of this Privy Council; but the conduct of the Army, then on foot, was left to the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> who is now Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>This Declaration &s;ettled the Af|fairs of the Kingdom, and prevent|ed the mi&s;cheif which might have hapned, in ca&s;e the election of the&s;e great Officers of State had been left to the choice of &s;uch as might have de&s;igned to imbroil the King|dom, for their own private ends. About a Moneth after, on the four|teenth day of <HI>May,</HI> 1643. the King
<PB N="126" REF="65">died. At that time the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was attempting to inlarge his Do|minions in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> by a War with <HI>France.</HI> Don <HI>Franci&s;co de Melo</HI> was Viceroy there, at the Head of an Army before <HI>Rocroy,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;on, which he be&s;ieged in vain: For the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> a young General, of twenty two years of age, came &s;ea&s;onably to its re|lief, forced the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to a re|treat, and obtained of them a no|table victory on the nineteenth of <HI>May.</HI> All their Artillery was taken, with about three&s;core Colours; all their Bag and Baggage, and &s;ix thou&s;and pri&s;oners: The Colours were &s;ent to <HI>Paris,</HI> to be pre&s;ented to the new King, &s;ix days after his promotion to the Throne. The Viceroy behaved him&s;elf like a great Commander, he incouraged his men by his words, promi&s;es, and example; where he perceived the greate&s;t danger, there did he hazard
<PB N="127" REF="65">his per&s;on, and his life; but when he &s;aw the day lo&s;t, and the grie|vous &s;laughter of his Soldiers, he found a way out of his Trenches, to retreat with the &s;ad remains of his broken Army, and left his Enemy to glory in their Succe&s;s, and to in|rich them&s;elves with his &s;poils. The Count <HI>de Fontaines</HI> was then grie|vou&s;ly incommoded with a di&s;ea&s;e; neverthele&s;s, for the honor of his Ma&s;ter, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be car|ried in a Chair, during the fight, that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t his men with his Coun&s;els, and incouragement; &s;ee|ing he could not help them by his example. He purcha&s;ed to him&s;elf much renown with the lo&s;s of his life; for he re&s;olved to overcome or die. Therefore in the hurry and rout of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom he labored to keep to their Colours, he was killed by a mean hand.</P>
<P>This victory gave a check to the de&s;igns of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> of
<PB N="128" REF="66">inlarging their Borders upon <HI>France.</HI> They had per&s;waded them|&s;elves, that the <HI>French</HI> had been di&s;|couraged, during the &s;ickne&s;s of the old King; and that they were not &s;o able to make re&s;i&s;tance in the mi|nority of the new; for commonly, Factions and private Intere&s;ts, raign in all Courts and Armies, when the Prince hath not attained to the age and ability of managing his own affairs. But it hath been ob|&s;erved, that when men intend to advantage them&s;elves by their Neighbors weakne&s;s, they find them&s;elves di&s;appointed at la&s;t, for providence makes u&s;e of the feeble&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible Agents to defeat the proude&s;t purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> General pur&s;ued the Enemy into his own Countrey, and took, from him, &s;everal &s;mall Forts and Towns, as <HI>Maubeuge, Borle|mont, Aimmerikt, Binch,</HI> and <HI>Thion|ville, &amp;c.</HI> So that they that had
<PB N="129" REF="66">flattered them&s;elves of enjoying new Conque&s;ts, lo&s;t a &s;mall portion of their own Land. The Ca&s;tle and Town of <HI>Cirke</HI> &s;topped the cour&s;e of the victorious General; it was &s;o well furni&s;hed with Men and Pro|vi&s;ions, and commanded by &s;uch a re&s;olute Governor, that the threats of the <HI>French</HI> Army, the inconve|niency of an approaching Siege, and the noi&s;e of the thundering Cannon, could not prevail upon him to yield to the fir&s;t Summons, therefore it held out again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> &s;everal days; but when they had brought their Trenches to the Town Walls, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> heark|ned to Conditions of Surrendring it up.</P>
<P>After this, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> left the Army, about the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> to receive the Compli|ments of the Court at <HI>Paris,</HI> for his great &s;ucce&s;s in <HI>Flanders;</HI> but at his fir&s;t arrival, the news of the
<PB N="130" REF="67">death of the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Guebri|ant,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> Forces in <HI>Germany,</HI> ha&s;tned him thither. He had been ingaged in a Battle again&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, on the &s;eventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> where he was mortal|ly wounded; for he died a few days after. The fight had been de&s;|perate between the <HI>Germans,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> both lo&s;t a great many of their be&s;t men; &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> Army was not able to hold the Field any longer, without the coming in of fre&s;h and victorious Troops out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> with their young Ge|neral <HI>Enguien.</HI> His coming re&s;tored heart and courage to the &s;hattered Companies of the dead Mare&s;chals Army. The <HI>French,</HI> who are always wont to boa&s;t much in their Suc|ce&s;&s;es and Victories, and &s;eldom or never to grant the lo&s;s of the day to their triumphing Enemies, de|clare, That the Mare&s;chal beat the <HI>Germans</HI> out of the Field. It is
<PB N="131" REF="67">certain they &s;ei&s;ed, a little after, upon <HI>Rotueil,</HI> a Frontier-Town, where the wounded Mare&s;chal breathed forth his la&s;t ga&s;p.</P>
<P>This War between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> had ingaged mo&s;t Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the quarrel, the Trum|pets &s;ounded round about the Borders, in <HI>Savoy,</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Na|varre, Catalonia, Flanders, Ger|many, Al&s;atia, &amp;c.</HI> Armies and Armed Men did carry about, Death and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>In <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> had three watchful Commanders, Prince <HI>Tho|mas</HI> took from the <HI>Spaniard, Trin;</HI> the Marque&s;s of <HI>Ville</HI> &s;ei&s;ed upon <HI>A&s;t;</HI> and the Count of <HI>Ple&s;&s;is-Pra&s;|lin</HI> invaded <HI>Estura,</HI> &s;mall places that would de&s;erve no mention, if the&s;e Generals had but taken any more con&s;iderable Towns; but for want of &s;tronger and more noted Garri&s;ons, and braver exploits, the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t needs &s;tuff their Relations
<PB N="132" REF="68">with the taking of the&s;e poor Ham|lets. And the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> on their &s;ide, were not idle, they gained &s;everal places upon the <HI>French,</HI> but none of any importance.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the Mare&s;chal <HI>de la Mouthe Houdancour</HI> commanded as Viceroy, for the <HI>French,</HI> at the head of a &s;mall Army, with which, he drove the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the Siege of <HI>Miravel</HI> and <HI>Flix;</HI> he made &s;ome inroads into the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and &s;ei&s;ed upon <HI>Almeras.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, at Sea, as well as at Land, the affairs of War were carried on with much heat: The Duke of <HI>Brez&egrave;</HI> was Admiral for the <HI>French,</HI> in the <HI>Streights.</HI> He in|gaged, with his Light Squadrons, again&s;t the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet, twice, once before <HI>Carthagena,</HI> in the Moneth of <HI>August;</HI> and another time, on the nineth day of <HI>September.</HI> In both Rencounters, the <HI>Armadoes</HI> ex|changed a few Bullets, looked one
<PB N="133" REF="68">another in the face; but they were &s;o &s;cared with their Enemies fright|ful countenances, and with the ap|prehen&s;ion of what might happen, if they continued too ob&s;tinately in the fight, that they were both willing to part upon equal terms; although the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniard</HI> both claim the Victory as their own.</P>
<P>When the War is once kindled between the&s;e two Nations, it is not one or two Campagnes can put a period to their di&s;putes; no le&s;s then a River of the Subjects Blood mu&s;t be &s;pilled, to extingui&s;h the flames. And it is ob&s;ervable, that all their Neighbors mu&s;t dance at the &s;ound of their Fiddles, and be intere&s;ted in their quarrels. All the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> mu&s;t attend up|on them, and &s;econd their bloody de&s;igns. War like a Tempe&s;t, com|monly ri&s;eth out of <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> then it &s;preds it &s;elf, and involves
<PB N="134" REF="69">all the Neighborhood into the &s;ame mi&s;ery. Both Kingdoms are &s;o po|pulous and con&s;iderable, that when the Princes of either &s;tir, all the bordering people move; they are forced in their own defence to have their Armies ready; which when they are &s;o, Intere&s;t obliges them to employ them.</P>
<P>During this Winter, great prepa|rations were making for the en&s;uing Spring of the year 1644. As &s;oon as it appeared, the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was appointed to command in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> where he be&s;ieged <HI>Graveling,</HI> which was &s;urrendered to him, after a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance of two moneths: He made his entry the Twenty nineth of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>This place was &s;trong and well fortified, and the Key of <HI>Flanders,</HI> on that &s;ide; therefore the taking of it, did as much rejoyce the <HI>French,</HI> as it did grieve the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> After this &s;ucce&s;s, the Mare&s;chal of
<PB N="135" REF="69"><HI>Ga&s;&s;ion,</HI> Lieutenant General, had orders to march with his Army fur|ther into the Enemies Countrey, where he took and pillaged &s;ome &s;mall Ca&s;tles, the Abby of <HI>Vate,</HI> the Forts of <HI>Rebus, d'Henuin,</HI> and <HI>Arq.</HI> Some few <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops that were &s;o unhappy as to come within his reach, were put to flight.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> was General in <HI>Germany;</HI> for that Countrey hath always been the Seat of War, when any is &s;tir|ring in <HI>Europe.</HI> At this time, the whole Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria</HI> that have &s;o great a &s;way in that Climat, thought them&s;elves ingaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> their Brother, again&s;t the common Enemy the <HI>French.</HI> General <HI>Merci</HI> commanded the Army of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> he was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful to take <HI>Frie|burgh</HI> from the <HI>French.</HI> As he was marching farther, to be&s;iege &s;ome other place, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="70">met him with his Army, and in|gaged three times on three &s;everal days; at la&s;t, the <HI>French</HI> forced them, after a notable &s;laughter, to a di&s;orderly retreat. After this, many con&s;iderable Towns &s;ubmitted to the conquering valor of the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> and received, from him, Garri&s;ons only to pre&s;erve their Territories from the &s;poil, which otherwi&s;e he would have made. <HI>Philipsbourgh,</HI> a &s;trong Frontier Town, <HI>Vormes, Spire, Mayence, Burghen, Landau,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Magdebourgh,</HI> were yielded up this Summer.</P>
<P>But before the year was over, the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> agreed to &s;end all their Plenipotentiaries to <HI>Munster,</HI> there to compo&s;e their differences, and agree in a General Peace; for <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Frontier Towns of the Empire had been &s;o much impoveri&s;hed; by the long and con|tinual Wars, that as many died by
<PB N="137" REF="70">Famine, as formerly by the Sword. The only remedy was an Univer&s;al Peace, which was endeavored be|tween all the Princes of Chri&s;ten|dom. The Queen Regent of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ent thither the Count <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Servien,</HI> to manage the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t; afterwards the Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> followed. The Treaty began in the Moneth of <HI>A|pril,</HI> 1644. but could not be con|cluded till the Twenty fourth of <HI>October,</HI> 1648. All the Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> agreed to lay down Arms, and to &s;uffer their People to injoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, only <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had &s;uch differences as could not be compo&s;ed, their pre|ten&s;ions were &s;o high, and &s;o in|tangled, That the greate&s;t Politi|tians that a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this compo&s;ure of Affairs, could not find any ex|pedient to bring them to an agree|ment: Therefore the Mini&s;ters of other Princes did their bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="138" REF="71">without them. When they &s;aw them &s;o &s;tiff, in not yielding to one another, they left them to them|&s;elves, and their Ma&s;ters alone, to end their own quarrels, and fight till they were weary. That which admini&s;tered new difficulties every day to this Peace, between the two Monarchies, was the pro&s;ecution of the War, which was &s;o vigorou&s;ly managed by the <HI>French,</HI> in the time of the Treaty, that in the begin|ning of the Spring, 1645. they had five Armies on foot, in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The Army of <HI>Flanders</HI> was com|manded by the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> as <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo;</HI> his Lieutenants were the Mare&s;chals <HI>de Ga&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Rant|zau:</HI> At their pa&s;&s;age over the Ri|ver of <HI>Colme,</HI> there was a very hot di&s;pute between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but, in fine, the two Mare&s;chals behaved them&s;elves &s;o
<PB N="139" REF="71">bravely, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was put to flight, and the pa&s;&s;age opened. <HI>Mardike, Bourbourgh, Lillers, Be|thune, Mount-Ca&s;&s;el, S. Venant, Me|nenes,</HI> and <HI>Armentiers,</HI> were forced to yield. The Town of <HI>Lens</HI> was &s;uddenly taken.</P>
<P>Upon the Borders of <HI>Germany,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> General, marched with his Troops as far as the <HI>Nekar,</HI> he took <HI>Rotem|bourgh,</HI> and went next to find out his Enemies, the United Forces of the Empire, that were encamped about <HI>Nortlinguen,</HI> and <HI>Dunke&s;piel.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> had here a notable victory, Four thou&s;and men were killed, with <HI>Merci,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bavariaes</HI> General; <HI>Gleen,</HI> the Em|perors General was taken, with all the Provi&s;ions, Artillery, Waggons, and above forty Colours. The Duke entertained <HI>Gleen</HI> very kindly, and &s;et him at liberty; the Neighbor|ing Towns, <HI>Nortlinguen</HI> and <HI>Dunke&s;|piel,</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="72">were &s;urrendered to the <HI>French,</HI> after the Battle. The Army had orders to march towards <HI>Hailbron,</HI> but the Duke fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick; &s;o that he was forced to withdraw, and be carried to <HI>Philipsbourgh.</HI> At this time, the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> uni|ted all its Forces under two Gene|rals, the Archduke <HI>Leopold,</HI> and General <HI>Galaz.</HI> There were in this Army above Thirty thou&s;and Men. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> and the Mare&s;|chal of <HI>Grammont,</HI> commanded in the <HI>French</HI> Army, in&s;tead of the Duke <HI>d'Enguien;</HI> they had not a|bove Twelve or thirteen thou&s;and Men, yet they behaved them&s;elves &s;o gallantly, that the Imperiali&s;ts could never come to fight them. They retreated with their Soldiers through their Enemies Countrey, and returned &s;afe home into the Borders of <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Generals were highly commended for their Wi&s;dom, in fore&s;eeing the
<PB N="141" REF="72">danger of a General Battle; and for their care and prudence, in ma|naging the Retreat to &s;ave their Men.</P>
<P>In <HI>Lorraine,</HI> the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Vil|leroy</HI> was &s;ent with an Army to drive the Duke out of his Domi|nions, becau&s;e he had Confedera|ted him&s;elf with the Enemies of <HI>France.</HI> The Inhabitants are natu|rally inclined to favor the <HI>French,</HI> therefore they made no great re&s;i&s;t|ance, but &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the King of <HI>Frances</HI> General, only <HI>La Mothe</HI> held out. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ma|galoty</HI> undertook to defend it; but his death cau&s;ed it to be &s;urrendred al&s;o: So that the poor Duke was driven out of all his Patrimony, by the overruling power of his Neigh|bor.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> were no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful for the General, the Count <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is-Pra&s;lin</HI> took <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> the nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> and the
<PB N="142" REF="73">Count <HI>de Harcourt,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Ca|talonia,</HI> defeated the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Fields of <HI>Liorerys,</HI> and forced the Town of <HI>Balaguier</HI> to open its Gates. <HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is-Pra&s;lin</HI> was ho|nored with the Staff of a Mare&s;chal of <HI>France,</HI> for his good &s;ervice to that Crown; and was commanded into <HI>Italy</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In the Duke|dom of <HI>Milan, Viguerano</HI> was taken from them; but when the Prince was in his Retreat, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ge|nerals overpowered him; and had it not been for the &s;ea&s;onable com|ing in of the new Mare&s;chal, his Sol|diers had been cut in pieces, and totally routed.</P>
<P>The next year 1646. the War was managed with the &s;ame fury as be|fore, e&s;pecially in <HI>Flanders,</HI> under the Dukes of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>d'En|guien,</HI> who laid &s;iege, with a nume|rous Army, well appointed, to the City of <HI>Courtray,</HI> which they took
<PB N="143" REF="73">in the pre&s;ence of all the Forces of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria,</HI> that came with a de&s;ign to rai&s;e the Siege. <HI>Mardike</HI> was again retaken from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was be&s;ieged by the Duke of <HI>Enguien. Caracena</HI> and <HI>Lambay</HI> were the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gene|rals, but they did not dare to ad|venture a pitcht Battle. The Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Leda,</HI> a famous and ex|perienced Commander, was then Governor of this Town, that was well fortified by Nature as well as by Art. Neverthele&s;s, the <HI>French</HI> won it in thirteen days, and forced the be&s;ieged to a Capitulation. Af|ter this, Prince <HI>Thomas,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brez&eacute;</HI> be&s;ieged, and took <HI>Orbi&s;elle;</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;o &s;trong in <HI>Italy,</HI> that the Court or|dered the Mare&s;chal <HI>de la Meilleray,</HI> and <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is-Pra&s;lin,</HI> with United Forces to march thither; they took two &s;mall places, <HI>Paombino</HI> and <HI>Por|tolongone.</HI></P>

<P>About this time, <HI>Henry de Bour|bon,</HI> Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> died, the Six and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> and his elde&s;t Son, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> &s;ucceeded him in his Principality, and to the honor of being the fir&s;t Prince of the Blood Royal of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1647. the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Ga&s;&s;ion</HI> forced many places to &s;ubmit; he was wounded at the &s;iege of <HI>Lens,</HI> and carried to <HI>Arras,</HI> where he died. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villequier</HI> commanded in his ab&s;ence, and took the Town.</P>
<P>About this time the Duke of <HI>Brez&eacute;</HI> was killed over again&s;t <HI>Na|ples,</HI> with a Cannon Bullet, and his Fleet was put to flight by the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h Armado.</HI></P>
<P>But the misfortunes and ill &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> brought all his family to ruine. He had been &s;ollicited by the Rebellious <HI>Neapo|litans,</HI> to command their Army
<PB N="145" REF="74">again&s;t their lawful Prince. He too credulou&s;ly tru&s;ted an uncon&s;tant Rabble, and went to <HI>Naples</HI> to manage a War again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> in that part of the World, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria,</HI> of one of its be&s;t Kingdoms.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t arrival was attended by &s;ome Succe&s;&s;es, and the favor of the Inhabitants; but when the Court of <HI>France,</HI> out of a jealou&s;ie of his greatne&s;s, began to frown upon him, and deny the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they had promi&s;ed, and might have &s;ent him; the <HI>Neapoli|tans</HI> betrayed him to their old Ma&s;ters for their own &s;afety and pardon. He was carried into the Pri&s;ons of <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence he could &s;carce obtain his freedom in three years. This great di&s;appoint|ment brought the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> to a low e&s;tate, together with &s;ome other mi&s;carriages, that they have been guilty of.</P>
<PB N="146" REF="75">
<P>In this Campagne, <HI>Lerida,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t Bulwark upon the Borders of <HI>Spain,</HI> was &s;treightly be&s;ieged by the Army of the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;.</HI> The Count <HI>de Harcourt,</HI> had at|tempted it the year before; but this place &s;tood it out, till the la&s;t, &s;o that the &s;iege was rai&s;ed to &s;uc|cor &s;ome other more con&s;iderable Town, which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was ready to carry.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Spring 1648. that di&s;mal year for <HI>England,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> appeared again at the head of an Army in <HI>Flanders.</HI> where he took <HI>Ypres</HI> in twelve days; but before this &s;iege was over, where the <HI>French</HI> Army &s;uffered many wants, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had re|covered <HI>Funes, Courtray,</HI> and <HI>Lens.</HI> The&s;e advantages had made them contemn their Enemies, command|ed by the Prince: So that General <HI>Beck,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Arch duke <HI>Leo|pold</HI> in his Army, a&s;&s;ured him of a
<PB N="147" REF="75">full victory over the <HI>French.</HI> With this per&s;wa&s;ion, they ventured to ingage, but the Troops of <HI>Lorraine</HI> were di&s;ordered in the Battle, and the Archdukes Cavalry were &s;o mi&s;erably treated, that if the Prince <HI>de Ligny</HI> had not come in, with his re&s;erve, the Archduke had been made pri&s;oner. General <HI>Beck</HI> died with the di&s;plea&s;ure of his ill &s;uc|ce&s;s, as well as by his wounds. This Battle was fought the twentieth of <HI>August;</HI> it cau&s;ed &s;everal petty Towns to open their Gates, as <HI>Lens</HI> and <HI>Furnes, &amp;c.</HI> At this time, Ma|re&s;chal <HI>de Schomberg,</HI> the Kings Ge|neral in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> took the Town of <HI>Tortoi&s;e,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Va|lencia,</HI> and defeated the Army of <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Melo,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> General, that came to relieve it.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Sieges, Battles, and Ren|counters, hapned during the Treaty at <HI>Munster,</HI> which excluded the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> Their
<PB N="148" REF="76">quarrels alone could not be ended, for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had intelligence of a &s;ecret Con&s;piracy in <HI>France,</HI> where the greate&s;t Princes were concerned. He did therefore expect to recover what he had lo&s;t by the favor of the Dome&s;tick Wars, and troubles of his Neighbors. The Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;,</HI> and many more of the Blood Royal were united together, they publi&s;h|ed their <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> to ju&s;tifie their taking up Arms to reform the Go|vernment, as was pretended, and to remove the Cardinal from that great tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by the Queen. <HI>Paris</HI> held for the Rebels, and many other Towns were in dan|ger of following the &s;ame example. The Inhabitants were more then u&s;ually &s;currilous and &s;candalous again&s;t the King, the Queen, and the Cardinal. The&s;e troubles had almo&s;t deprived the young King of his Crown and Scepter, had it not been for the &s;ea&s;onable a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="149" REF="76">and kind Mediation of our great Monarch, and the vigorous endea|vors of the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Turenne,</HI> more faithful to his King then to his Religion.</P>
<P>At la&s;t after much Blood&s;hed in an inte&s;tine War, the Prince re|treated into <HI>Flanders,</HI> with tho&s;e of his party, whom neither Love, Loyalty, nor Intere&s;t, could per|&s;wade to guard their young King. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> put him at the Head of their Troops, with which he re|covered almo&s;t all the Towns that he had formerly lo&s;t. If the Mare&s;|chal <HI>de Turenne</HI> had not &s;topped the progre&s;s of the Princes victories, he had invaded the Crown it &s;elf as well as the Frontier Towns. But after an ab&s;ence of &s;everal years, the King invited him home, received him into his favor, be&s;towed upon him his Government, and Employs, and treated the Dukes of <HI>Conti,</HI> and <HI>Longueville,</HI> in the &s;ame generous
<PB N="150" REF="77">manner, publi&s;hing a General Par|don to all other offenders in the Civil Wars.</P>
<P>On the Seventh of <HI>September,</HI> 1651. the King being thirteen years old, was declared of Age, &s;ufficient to take upon him the Government, and to begin to act in per&s;on, in that &s;phere where providence had put him. The Declaration was approved of in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and proclaimed all over the Land.</P>
<P>The War continued &s;till between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> In the years 49, 50, 51, and 52, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had the greate&s;t Succe&s;&s;es again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> for they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Sedition and Treachery of the Inhabitants, as much as by their own valor and numbers of Men, to recover more then they had former|ly lo&s;t. But after the Kings majo|rity, he appeared him&s;elf at the head of his Troops, and, with his pre&s;ence, gave them &s;o much cou|rage
<PB N="151" REF="77">and re&s;olution, that they turn|ed the fortune of War. The City of <HI>Bar,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ligny,</HI> was &s;urrendred to the Mare&s;chal <HI>de la Fert&eacute;,</HI> in 1653. The Duke of <HI>E&s;per|non</HI> be&s;ieged <HI>Bellegard,</HI> but could not take it, till the news was come, that the King was in the Camp; then the Governor was loath to &s;tand it out again&s;t his own Prince. <HI>Rethel</HI> and <HI>Mouzon</HI> were retaken by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne, St. Menehou</HI> by <HI>la Fert&eacute;,</HI> the twenty &s;eventh of <HI>November. Du Ple&s;&s;is Pra&s;lin</HI> be|haved him&s;elf &s;o gallantly in taking this place, that the King gave it him to command. <HI>Grancey</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed <HI>Castillon,</HI> and with&s;tood the valo|rous efforts of General <HI>Caracena.</HI></P>
<P>The year 1654. was honored with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, and mo&s;t &s;acred Ceremony of <HI>France,</HI> the Coronation of their King at <HI>Rheims,</HI> with that holy Oyl which they affirm to be faln from Heaven,
<PB N="152" REF="78">and &s;ent from God for that purpo&s;e, to anoint their Kings therewith. When they have been thus inaugu|rated, the people have a particular re&s;pect for their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Stenay</HI> was be&s;ieged by the <HI>French,</HI> commanded by Mare&s;|chal <HI>d' Hocquincourt;</HI> when the <HI>Spa|niard</HI> &s;aw they could not hinder the taking of this place, they labored to make a Diver&s;ion, and to recom|pence them&s;elves for their lo&s;s, by the inva&s;ion of <HI>Arras. Turenne, la Fert&eacute;,</HI> and <HI>Hocquincourt,</HI> had orders to hazard all, rather then to &s;uffer this great City to fall into their hands. When they had called a Council of War, they re&s;olved to attack the Lines and Trenches, which they did with much re&s;olu|tion, in the night, the 24 and 25 days of <HI>August. Hocquincourt</HI> en|tered fir&s;t into the Enemies Camp, through the Troops of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> but he was beaten back
<PB N="153" REF="78">with a great &s;laughter of his Men; the other Commanders relieved, and &s;econded him: So that at la&s;t the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was forced to leave his Trenches with &s;ome lo&s;s of Men, of Ammunition, and Baggage: For the Governor of the Town &s;allied out at the &s;ame time, and recei|ved &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that the Enemy de&s;paired of being able to gain the Walls. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gene|ral pre&s;erved his Army by a &s;ea&s;on|able retreat, which was managed with that prudence and courage, that he hath worthily de&s;erved the admiration of his Enemies. The King went to vi&s;it his Camp and Army immediately after this Siege was rai&s;ed, to encourage and reward his brave Soldiers.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia</HI> al&s;o, the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s in taking <HI>Conflans</HI> and <HI>Cerdagne</HI> from the <HI>Spa|niard.</HI> About the beginning of the Spring 1655. <HI>Landrecy, Maubeuge,
<PB N="154" REF="79">Cond&eacute;,</HI> and <HI>St. Guilham,</HI> &s;ubmitted them&s;elves again to the <HI>French</HI> Mo|narchy. Thus the&s;e &s;mall places were often taken and retaken by the Armies of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> At every advantage, in the Field, the&s;e weaker Towns, of no re&s;i&s;tance, were forced, for their pre&s;ervation, to prefer their Safety to their Loyal|ty, and to &s;ide with the &s;tronge&s;t party.</P>
<P>In this year there was a League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive, made be|tween <HI>Cromwel</HI> and <HI>Mazarin,</HI> a|gain&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> upon conditions di&s;|graceful to the King and Court of <HI>France.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> &s;olli|cited his Ma&s;ters Affairs &s;o notably, that he got that Arch-Rebel to &s;end over, in the beginning of the Spring 1656. an Army of &s;tout Soldiers, commanded by <HI>Reynolds.</HI> For al|though <HI>France</HI> abounds in Men, it is wont to make u&s;e of the valor of its Neighbors, in all Wars, again&s;t
<PB N="155" REF="79">&s;trangers: For it hath been found, by experience, that the <HI>French</HI> are good for the fir&s;t On&s;et, but cannot abide nor weather &s;o many di&s;courage|ments, as the <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotch,</HI> and <HI>Switzers</HI> can in War; be&s;ides their Foot are not to be compared to ours. Therefore they may a&s;cribe their mo&s;t difficult Conque&s;ts to their Money, and to the <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotch, Iri&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Switzers</HI> valor; as we &s;hall &s;ee in &s;everal late Encount|ers with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Imperia|lists.</HI></P>
<P>The year 1656. was noted for the remarkable Siege of <HI>Valancien|nes,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> received an overthrow, and were forced to quit the place; but afterwards they took <HI>Cappelle</HI> and <HI>Valencia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of the Cam|pagne 1657. <HI>Montmedy</HI> was be|&s;ieged by <HI>la Fert&eacute;,</HI> the King him|&s;elf went thither, after that the Suc|cors which were intended for a re|lief,
<PB N="156" REF="80">were happily routed. After|wards the City yielded to his Ma|je&s;ty, and opened its Gates to re|ceive him on the &s;eventh of <HI>Augu&s;t. St. Venant, Bourbourg,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Mardike,</HI> al&s;o were taken by <HI>Turenne.</HI> Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;erved him in good &s;tead in the recovering of the&s;e places, e&s;pecially in &s;torming of <HI>Mardike.</HI> The attempt was not e|&s;teemed fea&s;able by the <HI>French</HI> Ge|neral, who had a de&s;ign rather to be&s;iege it, then to win it by an A&s;|&s;ault. But our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commanders undertook this perillous attempt, Sir <HI>Tho. Morgan,</HI> now Governor of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> lead his Party with &s;o much courage and re&s;olution, that they recovered the top of the Walls in an in&s;tant, pa&s;&s;ing through &s;howers of &s;hot and fire, to the great a&s;to|ni&s;hment of the re&s;t of the Army. This Gentleman hath purcha&s;ed to him&s;elf the name and honor of one of the brave&s;t Soldiers of <HI>Europe.</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="80">And when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> ventured in the night to &s;urpri&s;e this Fort again, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;aved it, beat back the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and obliged them to a &s;peedy retreat to <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> After this <HI>Turenne</HI> was employed with a Flying Party to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Ardres,</HI> which he did with &s;o much bravery, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> received there a con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Conque&s;ts were in|con&s;iderable to tho&s;e of the next year 1658. <HI>Turenne</HI> and <HI>La Fert&eacute;</HI> were the two Generals of the <HI>French,</HI> and after the death of <HI>Rey|nolds,</HI> drowned near <HI>Goodwin Sands,</HI> in a &s;mall Boat in which he ventured to pa&s;s from <HI>Mardike</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> my Lord <HI>Lockart,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Paris,</HI> took the charge of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces. The Army was com|manded to be&s;iege <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> for it had been agreed between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> that this place &s;hould be put into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hands. It
<PB N="158" REF="81">was &s;urrounded the Twenty fifth of <HI>May;</HI> which when the Marque&s;s of <HI>Leda</HI> had notice of, he &s;hut him&s;elf in, with a &s;trong Garri&s;on, re&s;olving to defend it, or die there. The Siege was carried on very re&s;olutely, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Armies made their approaches on a &s;udden; &s;o that the fear of loo&s;ing this &s;trong place, cau&s;ed the Archduke to en|deavor to rai&s;e the Siege by a&s;&s;ault|ing them in their Trenches. <HI>Turenne</HI> confided in his own &s;trength, there|fore when he heard of the Enemies approach, he marched bravely out of his Camp to meet the Archduke, the victory declared for the <HI>French.</HI> In this encounter, it was the unhap|pine&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to fight with their own Countrey-men. In the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army, the Noble and Cou|ragious Duke of <HI>York,</HI> a Prince of an invincible re&s;olution, was enter|tained by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> as one of the be&s;t Commanders of that Army.
<PB N="159" REF="81">That wi&s;e Nation, as well know|ing in Men as in Affairs, would not &s;uffer &s;o great a Courage idle, in time of War. If I might have the liberty in this &s;uccinct Narration, I could give an account of the mo&s;t heroick actions of his Royal High|ne&s;s; in&s;omuch, that <HI>Turenne,</HI> and the other Generals, have often con|fe&s;&s;ed him to be the able&s;t and mo&s;t skilful Commander of the World. His Courage and Wi&s;dom had not that &s;ucce&s;s that could have been expected at this time; for the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Regiments under my Lord <HI>Lockart,</HI> e&s;pecially that of Colonel <HI>Al&s;op,</HI> beat back the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and pur&s;ued them over the Sandy Hills, with a great &s;laughter. This victory was due cheifly to the courage of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>June,</HI> 1658. After the Retreat of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Army returned to the Siege, where the Marque&s;s of <HI>Leda</HI> was killed with a Bullet. After

<P>The King entered into the City, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, afterwards he delivered it up to my Lord <HI>Lockart,</HI> for the u&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who&s;e Blood and Valor had got it from the Enemy. <HI>Bergues, Furnes,</HI> and <HI>Dixmuyde,</HI> yielded al&s;o to the Kings Summons, &s;o did <HI>Oudenard.

<P>At that time <HI>La Fert&eacute;</HI> a&s;&s;aulted <HI>Gravelin,</HI> but could not recover it in a Moneth, for the Garri&s;on was &s;trong and re&s;olute. Many brave Actions hapned in this attempt, the

<P>In the interim, the Dukes of <HI>Mo|dena</HI> and <HI>Navailes,</HI> took <HI>Mortera</HI> for the <HI>French.</HI> This fir&s;t hath always been devoted to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> endeavored to take from the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ome little places which they recovered; but it is certain, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was the greater loo&s;er.

The King of <HI>Spain, Philip</HI> the Fourth, had cau&s;ed &s;ome Overtures of Peace to be made by the Popes Mediation. The <HI>French</HI> Court entertained them wil|lingly
<PB N="162" REF="83">upon condition of a match, between the young King, and the <HI>Infanta of Spain.</HI> When the King was at <HI>Lions,</HI> an Envoy came to him from <HI>Madrid,</HI> about this Negotia|tion.

The Queen-Mother was not a little u&s;eful in this bu&s;ine&s;s; for when the Cardinal did &s;eem to put in &s;ome Demurs, &s;he declared, That the Peace &s;hould be made without him, for that &s;he was re&s;olved, that her Son &s;hould match with one of her own Kinred.</P>
<PB N="163" REF="83">
<P>The Kings indi&s;po&s;ition had al|mo&s;t ruined this Affair, for he fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick; but he recovered after a few days di&s;temper.

<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> gra|vity was very &s;low in concluding the Peace; that Court trifled away the time in Con&s;ultations and Meet|ings, while&s;t the Spring of the next year 1659. was coming on apace.

The Marriage was performed in <HI>Fonta|rabia</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> the third day of <HI>June.</HI> The two Kings met in the <HI>I&s;le of Conference,</HI> &s;cituate between both Kingdoms, where the young Queen was delivered to her Husband, and both Kings &s;wore to keep, and con|firmed to one another the Treaty of Peace.</P>
<P>After this interview, they &s;epara|ted; the <HI>French</HI> King and Queen was received at S. <HI>John de Luz,</HI> with much pomp and Joy; and in their journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> every good City in their way expre&s;&s;ed their extra|ordinary &s;atisfaction, for the Marri|age
<PB N="166" REF="85">and Peace between the two Kingdoms. But their Reception at <HI>Paris,</HI> was one of the mo&s;t glorious Ceremonies, the mo&s;t &s;plendid Tri|umph of our Age. The young Queen was carried in an open Char|riot, &s;hining with all the riches of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies;</HI> &s;he was attended upon by the whole Court, in their greate&s;t &s;plendor and glory. The People, the Clergy, and the Nobility, did welcome her with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of joy, that they are not credible.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the next year 1661. on the nineth of <HI>March,</HI> the great Mini&s;ter of State, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> paid his la&s;t debt to <HI>Na|ture,</HI> having, by his policy, rai&s;ed him&s;elf and family from a low be|ginning, to the greate&s;t honors in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Court was plea&s;ed to Mourn for him, but they quickly ca&s;t off their &s;ad attire, when Mon&s;ieur of
<PB N="167" REF="85"><HI>France</HI> re&s;olved to marry with the Prince&s;s of <HI>England:</HI> A Lady, very well accompli&s;hed in <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Vertue.</HI> The publick ceremony was performed on the One and thirtieth of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>There hapned nothing remark|able this year, till the latter end. The fir&s;t day of <HI>November,</HI> the <HI>Dau|phin</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was born, to the great joy of all that Kingdom, Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Montau&s;ier</HI> was appointed to be his Governor.</P>
<P>One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty and two, the King made Seventy two Knights of the Order of the <HI>S. E&s;prit;</HI> all Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Nobility, and approved valor. In the &s;ame year there hapned a differ|ence between the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> about preceden|cy, in the City of <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>Spa|niards</HI> were prepared to receive the <HI>French;</HI> &s;o that the tumult was great, and &s;ome Blood&s;hed on both &s;ides.</P>
<PB N="168" REF="86">
<P>The <HI>French</HI> &s;ent their Complaints to <HI>Madrid,</HI> the King gave them &s;a|tisfaction, and forbad all his Amba&s;|&s;adors for the future, to appear in any publick &s;olemnity with the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France;</HI> for they claim a precedency in all Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> unle&s;s it be in <HI>Vienna,</HI> where the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria</HI> are Lords. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> preferred in this occa|&s;ion, the Peace and Quiet of his Kingdoms to this odd <HI>Punctilio</HI> of Honor.</P>
<P>This year was &s;pent in Sports and publick Diverti&s;ements of the Gen|try and Nobility at court, till the Moneth of <HI>November.</HI> Then the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>England,</HI> had Orders to demand the re&s;titution of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> for a &s;um of Money, according to their pretend|ed Agreement with <HI>Cromwel.</HI> It was generally &s;uppo&s;ed by the wi&s;e&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would never part with a place &s;o well fortified,
<PB N="169" REF="86">by their late indu&s;try, purcha&s;ed with the Blood of many of their brave&s;t Men that took it, and &s;o handy and commodious to them, both in Peace and War; and that therefore there would be a di&s;pute between the two Nations, for the recovery of it. But it hapned other|wi&s;e, to the Univer&s;al Sorrow of all our people, <HI>Dunkirke</HI> was &s;urren|dered, and the <HI>French</HI> King made his entry into it the &s;econd day of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>There had been a Treaty be|tween the old Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and this young King, by which the Duke made over to him, all his Right, Title, and Intere&s;t, in the Dutchy of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> for &s;ome Lands in lieu of it; and for the priviledge of being declared Heir to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> in ca&s;e the Fa|mily of <HI>Bourbon</HI> did fail. This A|greement had been made the &s;ixth of <HI>February,</HI> 1662. and confirmed
<PB N="170" REF="87">in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Moneth of <HI>March.</HI> So that the <HI>French</HI> &s;ei&s;ed upon all the Cities and Countrey of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> only the &s;trong Town of <HI>Mar&s;al</HI> remained in the Dukes hands, who &s;eemed un|willing to deliver it. Be&s;ides the young Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> was &s;uppo&s;ed to have won the Sol|diers there in Garri&s;on, therefore they would not &s;urrender it upon Summons.</P>
<P>This affair cau&s;ed the King to tra|vel into that Countrey, with a &s;uffi|cient Army, to reduce it to his obe|dience, commanding that <HI>Mar&s;al</HI> &s;hould be be&s;ieged without delay. His &s;udden motion &s;urpri&s;ed the Duke, and found him unprovided; therefore he went to meet his Ma|je&s;ty at <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> to &s;ubmit him&s;elf unto him. The King re|ceived him very generou&s;ly, and made him welcome; <HI>Mar&s;al,</HI> accord|ing to Agreement, was put into
<PB N="171" REF="87">the <HI>French</HI> hands, on the third of <HI>September,</HI> 1663.</P>
<P>A little before, the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Crequi,</HI> had been affronted, and in danger of his per&s;on, in the City of <HI>Rome.</HI> Some of the Popes Guards &s;hot into his Coach, and wounded his &s;ervants. When the Court of <HI>France</HI> heard of it, the King commanded the Popes <HI>Nuncio,</HI> then at <HI>Paris,</HI> to depart out of the Kingdom, and &s;ent for his Generals, ordering them to pre|pare for a War. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Se|venth did then &s;it in S. <HI>Peters</HI> &s;up|po&s;ed Chair. He &s;ent immediately, upon the news of the coming of the <HI>French</HI> Army, an Expre&s;s, to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, that he was much di&s;|&s;atisfied with the deed, and that he would give him all the &s;atisfaction that he &s;hould de&s;ire. The City of <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> was pitched upon to examine and di&s;cour&s;e of this affair, where the Popes, and the <HI>French</HI> Deputies,
<PB N="172" REF="88">concluded it the Twelfth of <HI>March,</HI> 1664. to the great joy of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Catholicks. The Pope yielded to his own di&s;honor, that his Ne|phew <HI>Flavio Chigi</HI> &s;hould wait up|on the King, and beg his pardon, that a Monument &s;hould be erected in the very place, for po&s;terity to gaze upon, with an In&s;cription, de|claring the cau&s;e of its &s;tanding there. This was performed accord|ingly; but the zeal of the <HI>French,</HI> for their King, and their concern|ment for his honor, is very remark|able in this occa&s;ion. The Parliament of <HI>Aix</HI> hearing of the affront given to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and the Kings re&s;olution to revenge it, made &s;ome levies of Men of their own accord, and marched to <HI>Avignon,</HI> where they drive out the Garri&s;on, they &s;urpri&s;ed <HI>Carpentras,</HI> and all the Popes Territories near them. This action gave the King and Court great &s;atisfaction, and facilitated an
<PB N="173" REF="88">Agreement between him and the Pope; for the <HI>French</HI> are not &s;o wedded to their Super&s;titions, as to be &s;o much afraid of the Popes thunderbolts as in former ages. It would become the wi&s;dom of the Politicians of this Nation, to &s;hake off the Popes burden&s;ome Fetters, and e&s;tabli&s;h a Patriarch of their own. There wants nothing el&s;e to make their King an ab&s;olute Mo|narch. Some of the <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts</HI> have attempted to per&s;wade their Clergy to it, I hope God will one day open their eyes, to perceive their &s;lavery to S. <HI>Peters</HI> counterfeit Keys, and to oblige them to u&s;e that liberty unto which Providence invites them.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, that the Car|dinal was in <HI>France,</HI> the Emperor de&s;ired the Kings Succors, to help him again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had in|vaded his Dominions. This motion plea&s;ed the <HI>French</HI> humor, for they
<PB N="174" REF="89">would be thought to be the Cham|pions of Chri&s;tianity again&s;t the Infidels. The King ordered, as &s;ome &s;ay, about Ten thou&s;and Men to march under the command of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Coligny,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Fueillade,</HI> who is now Duke of <HI>Roannez.</HI> This Army joyned with the Imperiali&s;ts about the Moneth of <HI>June,</HI> 1665. they found out the <HI>Turks</HI> Army, and encountered with them twice. It is certain, the <HI>French</HI> behaved them&s;elves very gallantly in this expedition; &s;o that the Enemies were wor&s;ted, and in their retreat, over the River of <HI>Raab,</HI> they lo&s;t about Five thou|&s;and Men that were &s;lain, Sixteen pieces of Cannon, and about One hundred and fifty Colours were taken, with much of their Baggage. The re&s;t of their Army fled, not be|ing able to with&s;tand the Chri&s;tians valor.</P>
<PB N="175" REF="89">
<P>The Queen-Mother of <HI>France</HI> fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, and died the Twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> in that omni|ous year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty &s;ix. She was much lamented in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> for &s;he was an excellent Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>At this time there was War be|tween the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland.</HI> Their Fleets had had a bru&s;h at Sea, where the brave Duke of <HI>York</HI> adventured, in per&s;on, again&s;t their Squadrons, more in number then ours. <HI>Opdam</HI> their Admiral was blown up, and after a &s;harp fight they fled to their own Coa&s;t, to carry thither the &s;ad news of their defeat, and of the lo&s;s of many Ships taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> When the <HI>French</HI> &s;aw that the <HI>Hollander</HI> was likely to be wor&s;ted, he pretended an obligati|on to defend them; therefore he declared War again&s;t us, not &s;o much with an intention to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
<PB N="176" REF="90"><HI>Hollander</HI> by Sea, as to &s;tand by with his Fleet, and judge of the blows. However, the countenance of &s;uch a Prince, dreadful to all the World, becau&s;e it was not known yet what mi&s;cheif he could do, helped them very much.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> made no attempts upon us at home, unle&s;s it be upon our indu&s;trious Merchants, who lo&s;t &s;ome Goods and Ships at Sea. But in the <HI>West Indies</HI> their treache|ry and cruelty were remarkable in the Iland of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Plantations had lived in Peace and Amity &s;eve|ral years, they &s;uppo&s;ed our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> would endeavor to drive them away, after this breach between the two Nations. To prevent there|fore that which the others had no de&s;ign to execute, they fell upon them unawares, and ma&s;&s;acred their Neighbors, to their eternal &s;hame, plundering all their Goods, and
<PB N="177" REF="90">rifling their habitations. They &s;ei|&s;ed next, the I&s;lands of <HI>Antego, Ta|bago,</HI> and S. <HI>Eu&s;tache.</HI> Our Men re|&s;olved to revenge the&s;e outrages up|on tho&s;e of <HI>Guadeloupe;</HI> but the Fleet that &s;et forth for that intent, was di&s;per&s;ed by a terrible <HI>Hurri|cane,</HI> and &s;ome of our Ships were broken and &s;hipwracked, among&s;t the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, to the great di&s;appointment of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> continued till the year 1668. the Peace was concluded at <HI>Breda;</HI> for the <HI>French</HI> had no quarrel with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but only as was pretended in defence of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, the King did not care to have two Enemies upon his back, at once; he was re&s;olved to take into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ome Towns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> belonging to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> he was glad that His Maje&s;ty of <HI>England,</HI> would let him alone, and not intermeddle in this
<PB N="178" REF="91">Affair. The pretence to colour the inva&s;ion was, that &s;ome Articles of the Treaty of Marriage were not performed by the Court of <HI>Spain.</HI> The King, by his Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Madrid,</HI> acquainted them with his demands, but they neglected to give him &s;atisfaction; this cau&s;ed him to publi&s;h his <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> to ju&s;ti|fie the &s;ei&s;ure of tho&s;e Lands and Towns which, he &s;aid, belonged to the Queen, by agreement at her Marriage.</P>
<P>At the end of <HI>May,</HI> 1667. he en|tered into <HI>Flanders</HI> with about Thirty thou&s;and Men, well furni&s;h|ed. The fir&s;t Garri&s;ons were for|&s;aken, as <HI>Armantiers, La Ba&s;&s;&eacute;e, Cond&eacute;,</HI> and <HI>S. Guilhain. Bergnes</HI> and <HI>Furnes,</HI> were yielded up to the Mare&s;chal d' <HI>Aumont.</HI> The King com|manded <HI>Charleroy</HI> to be rebuilt and fortified, that it might &s;erve as a Bulwark again&s;t <HI>Flanders. Tournay</HI> was be&s;ieged and a&s;&s;aulted, but
<PB N="179" REF="91">could not &s;top the impetuous tor|rent of the <HI>French,</HI> that carried, at this time, all before them. <HI>Douay</HI> waited for their coming, its Gover|nor had the meen to &s;top the <HI>French</HI> progre&s;s: But upon his Maje&s;ties Summons, he obeyed, and &s;ent him the Keys. <HI>Courtray</HI> was taken in four days; <HI>Oudenard</HI> and <HI>Alost</HI> were quickly frighted into a compliance with the <HI>French. Lille</HI> was the next Garri&s;on that had the unhappine&s;s to be in the <HI>French</HI> Kings way. The Governor of this place had the re|putation of a brave Commander, he had under him 800 Hor&s;e and 4000 Foot in Garri&s;on, and was re&s;olved to defend it. Therefore the King came before it with his whole Army, laid &s;iege to it, and, after a very &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, obliged the renown|ed&punc; Governor to &s;ave the re&s;t of his men by yielding up the Town, upon honorable terms. The King made his entry on the Eight and
<PB N="180" REF="92">twentieth day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> One thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty and &s;even.</P>
<P>During the &s;iege, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Commanders had rai&s;ed a &s;mall Ar|my, with an intent to A&s;&s;ault the <HI>French</HI> before <HI>Lille. Marcin</HI> was at the Head of the&s;e Troops in his march, when <HI>Crequy, Rouvray, Lille|bonne,</HI> and <HI>Bellefonds,</HI> met with his Cavalry, in two &s;everal Rencoun|ters, and broke his de&s;ign. For the&s;e Captains had &s;o di&s;ordered his Men, and &s;cared them, that they could not be per&s;waded to attempt upon the <HI>French</HI> again without more a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>After this Campagne, the King went to <HI>Paris,</HI> and in the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the Spring, One thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty and eight, he gave order to his Armies to march towards the <HI>Franche Comte.</HI> The Prince had the command of this ex|pedition; but when the Inhabitants under&s;tood it, they &s;ent to his Ma|je&s;ties
<PB N="181" REF="92">Deputies, to treat of yielding to him, to prevent the &s;poils of an Army. While&s;t the Deputies de|layed, the Prince, with his Army, being ready, went &s;treight to <HI>Be&s;an|zon,</HI> where he encamped. On the &s;ixth of <HI>February,</HI> it was &s;urrendered into his hands; &s;ome other Towns were taken without re&s;i&s;tance, and <HI>Salines</HI> was &s;ei&s;ed upon &s;uddenly. At that time his Maje&s;ty was come to his Army, which he cau&s;ed to draw near to <HI>Dole,</HI> a place well for|tified and furni&s;hed with Men and Cannon, which cau&s;ed the Inhabi|tants to &s;tand upon their Guards, and think of a re&s;i&s;tance; but when they &s;aw that the <HI>French</HI> had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all the Outworks in one night, and lodged them&s;elves under their Counter&s;carpe, they accepted of his Maje&s;ties offers, and &s;ent him the Keys of their City.</P>
<P>All the&s;e places were taken in twelve days, to the great a&s;toni&s;h|ment
<PB N="182" REF="93">of all Neighboring People.</P>
<P>There had been &s;ome overtures of Peace made the year before: To pre|vent the conclu&s;ion of them, the King appeared with his Army this year &s;o early in the Field; for the <HI>Dutch</HI> had threatned him, by their Amba&s;&s;ador, to joyn with the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI> if he would not hearken to an accommodation. This Speech, together with the Re&s;olution of his Neighbors, of ri&s;ing up in Arms again&s;t him, brought forth the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chappelle:</HI> Unto which place, <HI>Colbert</HI> was &s;ent as an Extraordinary Amba&s;&s;ador, to meet with the Mini&s;ters of the Media|ting Princes. It was &s;igned the &s;ixth of <HI>May,</HI> and &s;ent to be publi&s;hed at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> King was mightily offended at the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had forced him, again&s;t his will, to this conclu&s;ion of Peace; therefore in due time he was re&s;olved to find an occa&s;ion
<PB N="183" REF="93">to puni&s;h them for their &s;auci|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Nobility and Gallants of <HI>France</HI> that had prepared their equipages, for the next Campagne, when they &s;aw them&s;elves di&s;appointed by a ha&s;ty Peace, re&s;olved to venture a|broad in Foreign &s;ervice. <HI>Fame</HI> had told them of the long Siege of <HI>Candy,</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and that the&s;e Infidels did daily win upon the be&s;ieged by their numbers; there|fore the greate&s;t Zealots of them re|&s;olved to hazard their per&s;ons for the releif of that noble City be|longing to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> The Duke <HI>de Roannez,</HI> the Count of <HI>St. Paul,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Chateau-Thierry,</HI> the Chevalier <HI>de Harcour,</HI> with many other brave Adventurers, voluntari|ly ingaged them&s;elves in this expe|dition. It is certain, that they be|haved them&s;elves with all the gal|lantry that could be expected. At
<PB N="184" REF="94">their return, they acquainted the King with the condition of the place, and the &s;trength of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>This per&s;waded his Maje&s;ty, to|gether with the Sollicitations of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to &s;end over thither the Dukes of <HI>Beaufort</HI> and <HI>Navailles,</HI> with about 10000 Men, to &s;ee whe|ther they could rai&s;e the &s;iege. All the World expected a Succe&s;s an|&s;werable to the <HI>French</HI> courage: At their fir&s;t &s;allying out upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> they beat all down before them; but when the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;aw their vigor abate, they charged furiou&s;ly upon them, and routed them, for|cing them back into the City Walls. <HI>Beaufort</HI> him&s;elf was lo&s;t, and kill|ed, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, in the rout, but his body could not be found afterwards.</P>
<P>He was much to be blamed for venturing his per&s;on, and the honor of his Prince, among&s;t the meane&s;t
<PB N="185" REF="94">Soldiers; for Commanders of his rank and quality, are to be mind|ful, that the &s;afety of the whole Army depends upon the pre&s;erva|tion of their lives: They are never to hazard them&s;elves in the Front of a Battle, but when their pre&s;ence is nece&s;&s;ary, to give courage to their fainting Soldiers, or to add more vigor to them, when the victory is almo&s;t in their hands. After the de|feat of the <HI>French,</HI> the be&s;ieged City was yielded up to the <HI>Turks</HI> General, upon very favorable con|dition.</P>
<P>The King had intelligence about the end of the year 1669. that the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> did endeavor to &s;tir up the Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> again&s;t him. This cau&s;ed him to &s;end the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Crequy</HI> with an Army of 18000 Men into <HI>Lorraine,</HI> to take in that Countrey. The Duke &s;ei&s;ed upon <HI>Pont a Mou&s;|&s;on,</HI> and pulled down the Walls.
<PB N="186" REF="95"><HI>Epinal</HI> and <HI>Chat&eacute;</HI> held out a litte&egrave;, but they were, at la&s;t, Surrendered up into his hands, and the old Duke was driven out of all his Principality.</P>
<P>This year 1670. the King vi&s;ited his new conquered Towns in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> repair&egrave;d their breaches, re&s;tored their Fortifica|tions, and put them all into a good po&s;ture of defence. But that which was remarkable in this progre&s;s, the King had no extraordinary <HI>Militia;</HI> he tru&s;ted &s;o much the&s;e new Sub|jects, that he entered into all their populous Towns, attended only by his hou&s;hold Servants, and u&s;ual Guards.</P>
<P>This got him the love and re&s;pect of the <HI>Walloons,</HI> and &s;ecured him the hearts of his people, as well as the Walls of their Towns.</P>
<P>About this time, a King of <HI>Guinny,</HI> who lives at a City called <HI>Arda,</HI> &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Paris</HI> to treat
<PB N="187" REF="95">about an e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Trade, between that place, and the I&s;lands of <HI>America,</HI> under the <HI>French</HI> Scep|ter. The King entertained him, and his motion, very kindly, and &s;ent him back with Tokens of his liberality.</P>
<P>There had been an Order of the Kings Council publi&s;hed, by which certain Wares of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were prohibited in <HI>France.</HI> They labored, by their Amba&s;&s;ador, to per&s;wade the King to revoke this Order; but in vain, for the King was now re&s;olved to revenge him|&s;elf upon them, for their in&s;olent carriage towards him, and his peo|ple, in the <HI>West</HI> and <HI>East Indies,</HI> and in many Foreign Countreys; where they had ingro&s;&s;ed all the Trade to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is certain, that both the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had great cau&s;e to complain of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who had, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, di&s;covered
<PB N="188" REF="96">an un&s;ufferable Pride, and a haugh+ty carriage, not to be endured by Crowned Heads. They had exer|ci&s;ed their cruelty upon the Sub|jects of both Kingdoms beyond the Seas, and had &s;ei&s;ed upon their Goods, affronting thereby their Princes who are ingaged to protect them.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and other unju&s;t practi&s;es, as was pretended, obliged the <HI>French</HI> to prepare for War: There|fore in his Progre&s;s in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he vi&s;ited, him&s;elf, the Fortifications of all his Frontier Towns, and cau&s;ed the weake&s;t places to be fortified with new Works; from <HI>Dunkirke,</HI> he went to <HI>Amantiers,</HI> from thence to <HI>Lille,</HI> to <HI>Courtray,</HI> to <HI>Aeth.</HI> He found that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Montal</HI> had &s;trongly repaired the Walls of <HI>Charle le Roy;</HI> for which, he highly commended him.</P>
<P>Before the War was proclaimed, Madam <HI>de Orleans,</HI> the only Si&s;ter a

But as all our &s;atisfactions are momentary, &s;he had no &s;ooner &s;een the&s;e dear Relations, but was forced to leave them again, and re|turn over to <HI>France,</HI> where &s;he died &s;o &s;uddenly, that mo&s;t men en|tertained the bad reports that were rai&s;ed about her death. However, the Court of <HI>France</HI> honored her Birth and Vertues, with an out|ward Mourning, and the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s countenance &s;eemed to be very &s;ad and pen&s;ive, until the King had cheared him up with the thoughts of another Wife. The Daughter of the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> was pitched upon; the Mare&s;chal <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> was &s;ent to e&s;|pou&s;e her in the Dukes name, in the

<P>All this while, the War was pre|paring again&s;t <HI>Holland. England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were to unite their For|ces, by Sea and Land. On the &s;e|venth day of <HI>April,</HI> 1672. the King publi&s;hed his Declaration, to forbid all Commerce and Trade with the States of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces;</HI> and immediately after, appeared at the Head of an Army of One hundred and fifty thou&s;and Men, with whom he carried all before him in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> as a violent torrent: No|thing was of a &s;ufficient re&s;i&s;tance for &s;o great a power; every one did judge, that he would win all the other Towns, the following Spring,
<PB N="191" REF="97">if there were not a &s;top put to his undertakings. But the motion of the <HI>French</HI> is always violent at the fir&s;t, and then at the lea&s;t di&s;courage|ment, it begins to abate. The Dutchy of <HI>Cleves,</HI> the Electorate of <HI>Cullen,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Limburgh,</HI> the County of <HI>Zutphen, &V;trecht,</HI> and its Territories. <HI>Holland, Bra|bant, Overi&s;&s;ell,</HI> the <HI>Oriental Frieze, Groningen,</HI> and the Dutchy of <HI>Gel|dres,</HI> were full of <HI>French</HI> Troops, on a &s;udden. <HI>Or&s;oy, Ve&s;el, Burick,</HI> and <HI>Rhineburgh,</HI> that had been &s;o &s;trongly Garri&s;oned, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> thought them to be the Bulwarks of their Land, were &s;urrendered at the fir&s;t appearance of the Kings Standard. <HI>Reez, Emmerick,</HI> and <HI>Groll,</HI> were delivered to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Munster,</HI> who had taken up Arms to vindicate the <HI>French</HI> quar|rel.</P>
<P>The next attempt was, the Pa&s;s|age over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which was fir&s;t
<PB N="192" REF="98">undertaken by the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> at the Head of Two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, he &s;wom over it, although three Squadrons of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome few Foot, were ready to re|ceive him on the other &s;ide. When the <HI>French</HI> had recovered the Bank, they charged &s;o de&s;perately, that the Enemy was di&s;ordered, and fled to their Foot for &s;uccor. They had Barricadoed them&s;elves in, but when the Prince, and the Dukes of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Longueville,</HI> were got on the other &s;ide with their Infan|try, they re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault them in their Trenches. The Prince de|&s;ired to march in order again&s;t them, but &s;ome of his Men were &s;o furious, that nothing could keep them in. The Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> in a rage, went &s;o near them, with the Prince, that the Duke was kill|ed, and the Prince wounded in the left arm, with many more laid up|on the ground.</P>
<PB N="193" REF="98">
<P>When they &s;aw the whole Army &s;urround them, they de&s;ired quar|ter, which was granted by the Prince, by that means they yielded, and were all taken pri&s;oners. It is not good to render an Enemy de|&s;perate, a &s;mall company in a dan|ger have won the victory; there|fore the Prince freely offered them their lives.</P>
<P>This Action amazed the <HI>Hol|lander,</HI> and a&s;toni&s;hed the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who expected the Kings Army another way. <HI>Harnen</HI> was taken by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne, Ni|meguen</HI> and <HI>Schenk</HI> al&s;o. <HI>Does|bourgh</HI> and <HI>Zutphen,</HI> were &s;urren|de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed into his Maje&s;ties hands, and the City of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> &s;ent Deputies to yield it up. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lux|emburgh</HI> was &s;ent thither to take in all the places about <HI>&V;trecht.</HI> After this, <HI>Turenne</HI> recovered <HI>Crevecoeur, Co&euml;rden, Grave,</HI> and <HI>Bomel;</HI> &s;o that almo&s;t all the Inland Countrey
<PB N="194" REF="99">thereabouts, &s;ubmitted to the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were then &s;o much troubled, that they offered Conditions of Peace to the King; but he hoped to gain all the re&s;t of their Countrey: Therefore they were rejected as unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The King after all the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es, left the Army the Six and twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> where he was con|gratulated and welcomed by all the Societies of his Kingdom. The Queen was &s;o much overjoyed, that &s;he commanded a Chappel to be built at <HI>Roan,</HI> and dedicated it to <HI>Our Lady of Victories;</HI> for as a|mong&s;t the Heathens they did give to <HI>Pallas,</HI> the Godde&s;s of War, &s;e|veral attributes, and names be|tokening the many good Office that they fancied, proceeded fron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> her favoring of them: So the Pa+pi&s;ts a&s;&s;ign divers, and differing ti|tles to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who is
<PB N="195" REF="99">now become the Godde&s;s of War among&s;t them, and the Giver of Victory to her devout Pro&s;elites.</P>
<P>The Princes wound had ca&s;t him into an indi&s;po&s;ition, which made him follow his Maje&s;ty, and accom|pany the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> the Kings Brother, to <HI>Paris,</HI> leaving the Conduct of Affairs to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Luxembourgh</HI> and <HI>Turenne.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was then before <HI>Vo&euml;rden</HI> with Twelve thou&s;and Men; <HI>Luxembourgh</HI> prepares a &s;trong brigade of Two thou&s;and five hun|dred Men, and by a &s;ecret way over the Mar&s;hes, he gets into the Town undi&s;covered, with his Party, with which he made &s;uch &s;tout Sallies, that the Prince was forced to ri&s;e from thence with his Army, to leave &s;ome of his Baggage and Cannon be|hind him.</P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;carce time to look about, the <HI>French</HI> had been &s;o nimble and
<PB N="196" REF="100">furious, that they had gained all this Countrey, without any con&s;i|derable lo&s;s. But before the next Campagne, the face of affairs was changed, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had many Armies come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the <HI>German,</HI> and the <HI>Im|perialists,</HI> &s;ent their powerful Suc|cors to aid them: So that they have &s;ince recovered a great part of what they fir&s;t lo&s;t, and will, accord|ing to all probability, recover the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was now re&s;tored by Order of the States, after the inhumane ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>de Wit,</HI> to his Patrimonial Offices of <HI>Statholder, Admiral,</HI> and <HI>General of the &V;nited-Provinces.</HI> This generous Prince began to appear at the Head of an Army of 24000 Men; with the&s;e he re&s;olved not to be idle; &s;ome places he took, but did not yet dare to adventure again&s;t his in&s;o|lent Enemy, triumphing for &s;o many
<PB N="197" REF="100">great Succe&s;&s;es. <HI>Monterey,</HI> Viceroy of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> de&s;ired him to attempt &s;ome|thing in his Countrey, becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> had drained their Garri&s;ons; for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had not declared yet again&s;t them. According to this advice, he laid &s;iege to <HI>Charle|roy,</HI> a Fortre&s;s that was likely to annoy the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> their next Neighbors. <HI>Montal,</HI> the Governor, had notice of the de&s;ign, he Po&s;ts: thither in ha&s;te; and taking his: time in the night, he pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, and got &s;afe into the Garri&s;on, to the great joy of the be&s;ieged. The next day he adventured to &s;ally out with a &s;trong party, which was re|ceived and welcomed by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with lo&s;s on both &s;ides. When the King heard of this &s;iege, he drew near to the Borders of <HI>Pi|cardy,</HI> and gave order to &s;everal thou&s;ands of his Soldiers to meet
<PB N="198" REF="101">him, with a de&s;ign to beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> off. Therefore this intelligence cau&s;ed the Prince to ri&s;e with his Army, the Two and twentieth day of <HI>December,</HI> and depart: Which was &s;ignified to the King by a Po&s;t, &s;ent from the Governor.</P>
<P>At this time, <HI>Luxembourgh</HI> at|tempted to lead his Men over the Ice, to A&s;&s;ault <HI>Bodengrave, Swam|merdam,</HI> and <HI>Niverburgh;</HI> which three places he took without much re&s;i&s;tance. After this, the <HI>French</HI> went no further till the next Spring, 1673. They were all &s;ent into &s;eve|ral Garri&s;ons, where we &s;hall leave them to take notice of their behavi|or at Sea.</P>
<P>On the Water, as well as on the Land, the War was carried on. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had a gallant Fleet, with which they did defie the Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> But though <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> their Admiral, labored by Policy to fight us, and to &s;ur|pri&s;e
<PB N="199" REF="101">us at an advantage; he was much mi&s;taken to find our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> courage, in the greate&s;t di&s;courage|ment, not to re&s;i&s;t and brave Death it &s;elf.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty of <HI>England</HI> had been engaged to joyn his &s;trong Fleet with the <HI>French</HI> Squadron, which was commanded by the Count <HI>de E&s;tr&eacute;es.</HI> Therefore the Twenty eighth of <HI>May,</HI> 1672. in pro&s;ecu|tion of the War that had been de|clared again&s;t the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> our Fleet, under the command of the brave Duke of <HI>York,</HI> had a very &s;harp Engagement with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t; in which, the Victory declared for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with the lo&s;s of the <HI>Royal James,</HI> which was unfortunately burned; and of the Earl of <HI>Sand|wich,</HI> who was drowned, and his body found about the tenth of the next Moneth floating on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hore. He was an excellent Captain,
<PB N="200" REF="102">more fortunate in the <HI>Mediterrane|an,</HI> and in the <HI>Sound,</HI> then in our Channel. <HI>England</HI> lamented the lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a per&s;on. It &s;eems his courage de&s;troyed him; for when his Ship was Boarded and Fired by a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> when it was &s;urrounded by many of the Ene|mies be&s;t Ships; His re&s;olution to brave Death, and the Enemy, in the mid&s;t of the greate&s;t di&s;advantages and dangers, made him abide and continue the &s;ight in his Flaming Ship.</P>
<P>Of our <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Twenty four Per&s;ons of Note were killed, with three of the <HI>French.</HI> Among&s;t the re&s;t, a Gentleman, &s;o Courageous, Learned, Civil, and &s;o well accom|pli&s;hed, that I cannot but mention him in this place: It was Mr. <HI>Cle|ment Cotterel,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Cotterels</HI> Son. About fifteen Gentlemen were de&s;perately wounded, &s;even hun|dred Common Soldiers and Seamen
<PB N="201" REF="102">killed, and as many maimed. Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Rabiniere tres le Bois,</HI> Rear Admiral of the <HI>French,</HI> was killed, and buried at <HI>Rochel.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>York,</HI> in this En|gagement, behaved him&s;elf as a di&s;creet and wi&s;e Commander, with an undaunted Courage.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that if our whole Fleet could have had the conveni|ency of fighting, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had been for ever undone; but the Wind hindered mo&s;t part of our Ships from coming up to them; &s;o that the Blew Squadron was forced to ingage with the Enemy alone. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had great lo&s;s of Men and Ships; it is thought about five or &s;ix of theirs, be&s;ides the Fire|&s;hips were &s;unk: It is certain, that our Fleet pur&s;ued them to their own Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>About this time, the Twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> 1672. hapned a mo&s;t barbarous execution of the two
<PB N="202" REF="103"><HI>De Wits</HI> torn in pieces by the rude rabble of the <HI>Hague,</HI> their Privities cut off, their Bodies dragged through the Streets, and hanged at the Gallows, in &s;uch a barbarous manner, that the <HI>Cannibals</HI> would have been a&s;hamed to have done the like.</P>
<P><HI>Groningen</HI> had been be&s;ieged by the Mercenary Weather-cock of <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> but in the Moneth of <HI>August</HI> he left the Town, after a con|&s;iderable lo&s;s of his Men. The good Bi&s;hop was moved with compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ee his Soldiers &s;laughtered by the &s;tout-hearted <HI>Dutch;</HI> &s;o that he preferred their &s;afety, or it may be his own, to the filling of his Pur&s;e with Gilders; which was the thing this noble Captain aimed at in this attempt upon the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The States of <HI>Holland</HI> had pre|vailed with many of their Neigh|bors, e&s;pecially with the Emperor, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Bran|denburgh,</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="103">to &s;end their Succors to a&s;&s;i&s;t them by Land. The Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> was per&s;waded, notwith|&s;tanding his Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> to enter into the party. They were all re&s;olved to &s;end into the Field their Armies, in the next Spring; for they were afraid that the <HI>French</HI> would not be content with the Conque&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> but would incroach upon them al&s;o after|wards.</P>
<P>During this Winter, nothing hap|ned worthy of notice, but the lo&s;s of private per&s;ons, robberies, and &s;mall Encounters of Parties, that &s;ought for Plunder and Booties.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Spring, 1673. three Armies appeared for the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> the King of <HI>Spains</HI> commanded by the Count <HI>de Mon|terey,</HI> the Emperors by <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Brandenburghs</HI> by him|&s;elf; be&s;ides the Army of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was declared Ge|neral
<PB N="204" REF="104">at Land, Admiral at Sea, and Statholder by the States. The <HI>French</HI> Army commanded by <HI>Turenne,</HI> marched again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Bran|denburgh,</HI> who was forced to quit to him all the County of <HI>Marck,</HI> and to leave his Bag and Baggage behind him, for fear of a total de|feat of his Forces. The <HI>French</HI> took <HI>&V;rnia, Ham, Camen, Altenau, Soe&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Hoexter, Bilefeld,</HI> and <HI>Raven&s;perg,</HI> &s;mall places of no &s;trength.</P>
<P>At this time, the <HI>Swede</HI> and the <HI>Dane,</HI> with other Neuter Princes, had de&s;ired an accommodation of the differences between the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France. Cologne</HI> was the place of meeting; all the Ple|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ipotentiaries were &s;ent with In|&s;tructions: But although the <HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;o many lo&s;&s;es by Land, and by Sea, they would not yield to any rea&s;onable Propo&s;itions at fir&s;t. Their &s;tout hearts were re&s;olved to
<PB N="205" REF="104">try the Fortune of War, before they would li&s;ten to any peaceable conclu&s;ion. At la&s;t after &s;everal De|bates, and Con&s;ultations, the Peace was concluded between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the States, but the <HI>French</HI> pretentions were extraordi|nary high, and their Succe&s;&s;es great; &s;o that there was no po&s;&s;ibility that did appear, to end their differences at this time. But before the Peace was publi&s;hed between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> all this Summer of the year 1673. the War was vigorou&s;ly carried on by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>By Sea, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> command|ed a Fleet of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> One hundred and twenty Sail. With the&s;e Ships he attacked the <HI>Dutch</HI> Frigats, under the command of <HI>De Ruyter</HI> and <HI>Van Trump.</HI> The fight was mannaged with much re|&s;olution on both &s;ides: The <HI>French</HI> in the former Engagements had been taught to face their Enemy
<PB N="206" REF="105">upon the Water; for they behaved them&s;elves now very bravely, be|cau&s;e they could not well excu&s;e them&s;elves. It is certain, the Princes conduct and courage in this, and all other Engagements, have ju&s;tly de|&s;erved the prai&s;e of all Men, and the thanks of our Nation. This noble Spirit hath &s;ince his infancy, &s;pent his Wit and Blood in the de|fence, and for the honor of our Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> proclaimed Victory at Land, while&s;t their Ships and Shipwracks complained of their ill u&s;age at Sea by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They lo&s;t eight con&s;iderable Ve&s;&s;els, that of <HI>Van Haen</HI> was the chief, it was blown up by an unfortunate &s;hot. Many were &s;o di&s;abled, that they could not reach into their Harbors. His Maje&s;ties Fleet had received &s;ome damage in the Rigging, and lo&s;s of Men; but not &s;o as to hinder them the next morning, the nineth
<PB N="207" REF="105">of <HI>May,</HI> from pur&s;uing their Ene|mies to their own Coa&s;t. The <HI>Dutch</HI> lo&s;t many Men, &s;ome of note, and a Ship taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>At Land there were frequent en|counters between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French.</HI> The City of <HI>Ma&s;treicht</HI> was the cheif place of action this Summer: The Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Montall,</HI> were ordered to inve&s;t it, the &s;ixth of <HI>June:</HI> The re&s;t of the Army marched thither to po&s;t them&s;elves about this &s;trong place. <HI>Fario</HI> was then Governor, with a very &s;tout Garri&s;on of &s;ix thou&s;and Men; the Count <HI>de Mon|terey</HI> had &s;ent thither two thou&s;and <HI>Italian</HI> Hor&s;e and Foot, to reinforce the place. The King him&s;elf was in the Army with the brave&s;t and choice&s;t Regiments; and the Noble Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with &s;everal thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> under his com|mand.</P>
<PB N="208" REF="106">
<P>It is certain, the <HI>French</HI> King vi&s;it|ed the Trenches, and incouraged his Troops, with a great contempt of the danger. <HI>Fario</HI> had &s;ent him this civil me&s;&s;age, That if he knew whereabouts his Maje&s;ties Quarters were, he would command his Men to forbear &s;hooting to that place: The King &s;ent him word again, That his Quarters were every where in his Camp. The be&s;ieged made a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, many Men were kil|led on both &s;ides. It is thought that this Town might have put a &s;top to the <HI>French</HI> Conque&s;ts, if the Burgers had been more faithful to their old Ma&s;ters, and le&s;s carele&s;s of their lives and riches. It is cer|tain, that it had never been taken by the <HI>French</HI> alone, had not our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;pent their blood, and in contempt of all danger, pa&s;&s;ed with their Regiments through &s;howers of &s;mall and great &s;hot, to the A&s;&s;ault.</P>
<PB N="209" REF="106">
<P>We cannot &s;ufficiently admire the courage of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> a young General of an admirable conduct and skill in Martial Affairs. He commanded in the Trenches, with an intention to a&s;&s;ault the Counter&s;carpe, and the Half-Moon, before <HI>Bru&s;&s;els-Gate.</HI> He led on his Men with &s;uch re&s;olution, that though two or three Mines were &s;prung up, and the &s;hot fell thick among&s;t them, they carried the Half-Moon, to the great wonder of all men, in half an hour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was taken, the Duke, with his Party, was immediately re|lieved by the <HI>French,</HI> upon whom, the be&s;ieged played &s;o briskly, with their great and &s;mall &s;hot, that they beat them out with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Mine, and a &s;tout Sally. When the Duke &s;aw that the <HI>French</HI> had lo&s;t what his Men had got, he pre|pared him&s;elf to regain it; which he did with the greate&s;t re&s;olution
<PB N="210" REF="107">and happine&s;s imaginable. This in|vincible &s;pirit at the Head of his Party, leaped over the Trenches fir&s;t, with his Weapon in his hand, only twelve &s;tout Voluntiers accom|panied him, the re&s;t followed &s;o furiou&s;ly, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were beat|en off again, and his Grace became Ma&s;ter of the Half-Moon the &s;e|cond time, delivering it into the hands of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Feuillade.</HI> So that without flattery, the <HI>French</HI> ow the taking of <HI>Ma&s;treicht</HI> to the courage, conduct, and brave re&s;olu|tion of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> to the Blood and undauntedne&s;s of our <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Jones</HI> was killed in one of the&s;e a&s;&s;aults, which hapned the twenty fourth of <HI>June.</HI> After &s;ome other attempts, where our Men were again imployed, the Town de&s;ired a Parley the twenty nineth, and in two hours the Arti|cles were granted, That the Go|vernor and Garri&s;on &s;hould march

The King took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it the thirtieth of <HI>June,</HI> and commanded the Cardinal <HI>de Bo&uuml;illon</HI> to re&s;anctifie the Church|es profaned by the <HI>Dutches</HI> Devo|tions.</P>
<P>About this time there hapned an|other Sea-&s;ight, between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets, with lo&s;s on both &s;ides; but our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beat the boa&s;ting <HI>Dutch</HI> again into their Harbors, where they left them to complain of their wounds and dead, and to glory in their pretended Suc|ce&s;&s;es and Victories.</P>
<P>The many Armies that were now on foot, to attend upon and &s;top
<PB N="212" REF="108">the further proceedings of the <HI>French,</HI> cau&s;ed them to call away their Garri&s;ons from many Conquer|ed Towns: Be&s;ides the Sickne&s;s and the War, had con&s;umed a great number; &s;o that they were forced, for their own &s;afety, to gather a little more clo&s;e together. Several &s;trong places were abandoned, and &s;everal were di&s;mantled; the So|diers were &s;ent to reinforce the Armies.</P>
<P>During this Winter, many En|counters hapned between the Ene|mies, and &s;ome few uncon&s;iderable places taken. But now to the great joy of <HI>England,</HI> it plea&s;ed His Ma|je&s;ty to grant a Peace to the <HI>Hol|lander,</HI> on mo&s;t honorable Condi|tions to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King neverthele&s;s continues his de&s;igns by Land; but by Sea he commands his Ships to be drawn up, or to &s;ail out of the Dutchmens &s;ight. In the beginning
<PB N="213" REF="108">of the Spring he be&s;ieged <HI>Be&s;anzon,</HI> in the <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;; Pe&s;me, Mar|nay,</HI> were taken before by the Duke of <HI>Navailles,</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>February.</HI> The &s;trong Town of <HI>Gray</HI> was yielded up after two or three days &s;iege: On the twenty eighth, <HI>Ve&s;oal</HI> was al&s;o taken. The King him&s;elf, with a &s;trong Party, arrived at his Camp before <HI>Be&s;anzon,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> 1674. It was &s;urrendered into his Maje&s;ties hands before the end of the Moneth, after many brave exploits and much blood &s;hed.</P>
<P>Whiles the Treaty was on foot at <HI>Cologne,</HI> the Emperor cau&s;ed the Prince of <HI>Fur&s;temberg,</HI> Plenipoten|tiary for the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cologne,</HI> to be arre&s;ted by the Officers of his Regiment of <HI>Grana,</HI> in his Coach, and carried to <HI>Bon,</HI> becau&s;e he had not maintained the intere&s;t of the Empire, as he &s;hould have done, he being a Subject.</P>
<PB N="214" REF="109">
<P>This violent proceeding did mightily &s;candali&s;e all the Amba&s;|&s;adors, e&s;pecially the Archbi&s;hop, and the <HI>French</HI> King, were offended at this violence: For they pretend, that the per&s;on of an Amba&s;&s;ador is &s;acred, and not to be violated by any means. <HI>Nature</HI> hath taught the mo&s;t barbarous people to &s;uffer them to go and come in &s;afety, who are imployed in quenching the Flames of War.</P>
<P><HI>Navaigne</HI> was afterwards be|&s;ieged and yielded to the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;;</HI> but the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had an intent to &s;uccor it, had not the be&s;ieged made &s;o much ha&s;te to &s;ecure their lives by a Surrender. <HI>Dole</HI> was al&s;o be&s;ieged by the King, and taken after a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The fifteenth of <HI>June,</HI> there hap|ned a fight between Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> and the Imperiali&s;ts com|manded by the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Caprara.</HI> The
<PB N="215" REF="109">Duke of <HI>Bournonville</HI> was march|ing up to them, <HI>Turenne</HI> re&s;olved to hinder a conjunction; for that pur|po&s;e, he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Philips|burgh.</HI> The Duke and Count had but Seven thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and a Regiment of Foot, but <HI>Turenne</HI> was Twelve thou&s;and &s;trong. The Confederates behaved them&s;elves &s;o bravely, that had they not been inferior in number, they had forced the <HI>French</HI> to a retreat. After a hot ingagement, which la&s;ted all the Afternoon, the <HI>Germans</HI> &s;ought their fafety in a retreat over the <HI>Neckar;</HI> many brave Men were kill|ed on both &s;ides, &s;ome &s;ay the lo&s;s was equal. It is certain, four thou|&s;and Men lay dead on the Ground; the old Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> headed his Troops with &s;o much re&s;olution, as if he had intended to win a Duke|dom in another World, by his not|able courage.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="110">
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, about one hun|dred Sail, pa&s;&s;ed out of the Chan|nel to &s;coure the Seas, of all <HI>French</HI> Frigats, and to attempt &s;omething upon the Coa&s;t; they Landed on <HI>Belle I&s;le,</HI> but were repul&s;ed after the lo&s;s of a few Men.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> com|manded the <HI>French</HI> Forces in <HI>Cata|lonia;</HI> in the County of <HI>Rou&s;illon,</HI> he ingaged with them, and forced them to a retreat, with the lo&s;s of his Son, and another Gentleman of quality taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The next action was between the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Count <HI>de Souches,</HI> the eleventh of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> near <HI>Haynault.</HI> The two Armies were re&s;olved to have a bru&s;h, which was performed with much gallantry: The Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Army lo&s;t many Men, and Commanders; and the <HI>French</HI> di&s;puted the ca&s;e very &s;toutly; at la&s;t they retreated into
<PB N="217" REF="110">their Camp, carrying with them many noble pri&s;oners, and mo&s;t part of the Princes Baggage; leav|ing the <HI>Dutch</HI> to boa&s;t of their empty and &s;orrowful Victory, in the open Field.</P>
<P>At this time <HI>Grave</HI> was be&s;ieged by the <HI>Dutch:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> could not be per&s;waded to &s;urrender it, till after a long and bloody &s;iege.</P>
<P>The <HI>Me&s;&s;inen&s;es</HI> had revolted from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and put them|&s;elves under the <HI>French</HI> protection. The Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> arrived there, with &s;ome Succors, and relief of Men, and Provi&s;ion. The Inhabi|tants put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tronge&s;t places about the City; the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by Sea and Land, endeavored to plague them. A &s;hort conflict hapned upon the Coa&s;t, between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleets, where the noi&s;e of their great Guns, and their mutual Rodomontadoes, &s;oon terrified
<PB N="218" REF="111">them, and made them both willing to part upon equal terms. By this means the <HI>Me&s;&s;inen&s;es</HI> had &s;ome Pro|vi&s;ion brought to them in their ur|gent nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>In <HI>October,</HI> the Confederates, in|camped upon the skirts of <HI>Turennes</HI> Army, were forced to fight near <HI>Strasburgh;</HI> they lo&s;t three thou&s;and Men, ten Pieces of Cannon, thirty Standards, and many Pri&s;oners; the <HI>French</HI> al&s;o had many of their be&s;t Menkilled. The Confederates re|treated to <HI>Spire,</HI> and <HI>Turenne</HI> to the &s;ides of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>The taking of the Cittadel of <HI>Leige</HI> this Winter, by the <HI>French,</HI> was an accident, that &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;tartled all the World. It was be|trayed by a treacherous Governor, and delivered into the Kings hands, who &s;ent thither three thou&s;and Men to remain in Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>This year 1675 the War con|tinues &s;till call <HI>Europe</HI> is ingaged in
<PB N="219" REF="111">this Bloody di&s;pute, between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> have been per&s;waded, for the <HI>French</HI> &s;ake to enter into the Borders of the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and in defence of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, as they pretend, to help the <HI>French,</HI> who carries on the Popes. There|fore they have quartered their Army all this Winter, upon the Sub|jects of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who hath been forced to draw his Army from the Confederates to &s;top the <HI>Swedes</HI> violences.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King cau&s;ed <HI>Limburgh</HI> to be be&s;ieged, after the taking of <HI>Huy</HI> and <HI>Dinant.</HI> The Confederates were re&s;olved to rai&s;e the &s;iege, but the &s;urrender pre|vented them. Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have behaved them|&s;elves very &s;toutly in the defence of this Town.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with his Army, attends upon the

What end this great quarrel will have, God alone knows; however we ought to lament at the mi&s;eries of our Neighbors, at the Chri&s;tian Blood that is &s;hed to &s;atisfie the Am|bition of a Prince that wants no|thing on Earth, but Content. We ought to pray God to pre&s;erve our <HI>England,</HI> in Peace and Unity; and our gracious King, the be&s;t of all Monarchs, in health and pro&s;perity.</P>
