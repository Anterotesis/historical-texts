Therefore, the Lords of His Maje&s;ties Privy Council, for explanation of that clau&s;e of the &s;aid Act according to the true meaning and intent thereof; do declare, that the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hall be proceeded again&s;t by the Council as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the Act, who withdraw from their Paroch Kirks after three publick admonitions given by the Mini&s;ters of the re&s;pective Paroches out of the Pulpit in the Church upon the Lords day after divine Service: And that the Mini&s;ters atte&s;tation under his hand, That in pre&s;ence of two or moe &s;ufficient Witne&s;&s;es, he hath from the Pulpit upon three Lords dayes intimat the names of &s;uch, who ordinarly and wilfully ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the ordinary meetings of divine Wor&s;hip in their own Paroch Church, &s;hall give an &s;ufficient ground of proceeding again&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons as tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors of the &s;aid Act.

So they do require &s;uch per&s;ons, as &s;hall be called by the Mini&s;ters legally planted, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of &s;in and di&s;orders in the Paroch, to give their concurrence for that effect.
