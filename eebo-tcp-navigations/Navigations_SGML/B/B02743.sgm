<HEAD>To the Right Reverend and Illu&s;trious, CARDINAL <HI>de</HI> MONTE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE horrible fierce Di&s;cordances, and inte&s;tine Civil Wars of Chri&s;tian Princes, had reduc'd me (mo&s;t noble Cardinal) to this condition, That being de&s;poyl'd and plundered of all E&s;tate, bound in Chains, and haled thorow the Moun|tainous &amp; dangerous Pa&s;&s;ages
<PB REF="3">of <HI>Thracia</HI> and le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> dragged about from place to place, like hor&s;e unto a Mar|ket, I became &s;even times &s;old to the &s;undry and toyle&s;ome &s;orts of ru&s;tick labors; where under an heavy <HI>Turkish</HI> rod, &amp; &s;harper provocations, in hun|ger and thir&s;t, in cold and na|kedne&s;s, expo&s;ed to all open|ne&s;s of Airs, I was compell'd to attend the feeding Sheep, Goats, and all other &s;orts of Cattel, and oftentimes to ex|erci&s;e their di&s;cipline of war. For prevention therefore of a la&s;ting mi&s;ery, I endeavoured an e&s;cape; and wandering up and down, guided by the Nor|thern
<PB REF="3">Pole, &s;u&s;taining Life with Acorns, wilde herbs, and their bitter roots, &s;odden with a little &s;alt, I &s;pent my time in &s;olitarine&s;s, amid&s;t even ra|vening Bea&s;ts; till at length, having fa&s;tned together &s;ome few Timber pieces with cords and wythes, I ventured to pa&s;s the Helle&s;pontick Sea; but was retaken, and brought back again unto my Ma&s;ter; where tyed both hands and feet, and pro&s;trated on the ground, I was mo&s;t cruelly and &s;everely &s;courged and thre&s;hed; and after, for the &s;pace of thirteen yeers, to&s;&s;ed and tumbled on the waves of
<PB REF="4">a &s;ad and adver&s;e fortune un|der the Turki&s;h Government. I endured and &s;uffered many mi&s;eries, calamities, afflicti|ons, and per&s;ecutions for my Religions &s;ake.</P>
<P>But when I had found by &s;ad exprience, that the for|mer more compendious way through <HI>Thrace,</HI> could not free me from their Tyranny, and grievous Slavery, I re&s;olv|ed to &s;teer another cour&s;e by ob&s;ervation of the Southern Pole, to pa&s;s the De&s;arts and perillous places of <HI>Caramania</HI> and <HI>Syria:</HI> and &s;o through many and various difficulties, I at length arrived in the holy
<PB REF="4">Land, and was received by the Brethren of Saint <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> inhabiting Mount <HI>Sion:</HI> from whence, after the refre&s;hment of a yeer, as a man revived from death, (by God's Almighty providence) and as &s;natched from the claws of the helli&s;h Dragon, &amp; freed from tho&s;e cruel tor|tures, I return'd home among&s;t my Chri&s;tian Friends, a true witne&s;s of the Turki&s;h cruel|ties; that they with due repen|tance for their &s;ins and errors, might learn to avoid like cru|cifyings and tortures; and likewi&s;e under&s;tand what high degree of hate tho&s;e men
<PB REF="5">de&s;erve, who&s;e foul ambitions &s;top and hinder the employ|ment of Chri&s;tian &s;words from de&s;tructing and aboli&s;hing that Satanick-Turki&s;h Go|vernment, which may (by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance) be the only preventor of our future mi|&s;eries; and which hath been long-&s;ince, and propheti|cally &s;poken of, both by Chri|&s;tians and Infidels.</P>
<P>Therefore having fini&s;hed a large perambulation of the holy Land, and vi&s;ited good part there of the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and de|&s;cribed rudely the Tragedy of their cruelties, together with other circum&s;tances of that
<PB REF="5">Government, all which I ga|ther'd from daily conver&s;ati|on, experience, &amp; long practi&s;e in Courts and Camps of the Turki&s;h Emperour; and what more I could ever learn from ratiocinations with wi&s;e and experienced men, or by read|ing, I committed &s;til to memo|ry, and at &s;everal times &amp; &s;tati|ons, remitted them to writing, and made them after publick; which divers learned and &s;o|ber per&s;ons tran&s;lated into their &s;everal Idiomes: which when I found, and perceived they might prove nece&s;&s;ary, or &s;omewhat u&s;eful, &amp; favour|ably accepted by the Reader,
<PB REF="6">I recollected them, and bound them up into this little bun|del, and have dedicated the whole unto your Grace, the be&s;t of Patrons, printed in this famous City, <HI>Rome,</HI> receptacle of all Natoins, to be difper&s;ed to all Friends and Strangers.</P>
<P>Do you therefore by the ex|ample of our Saviour Chri&s;t, who preferred the poor Wid|dows mite, before the gifts of Princes, &amp; with that purcha&s;ed the inheritance of immortali|ty, favourably &amp; in good part accept of this poor oblation, from</P>

<P>HE that de&s;ires to move compa&s;&s;i|on or &s;uch-like affections in o|thers, mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;ympathy and natural inclination thereto him&s;elf.

What heart &s;o flinty, as to forbear lamenting for them? The rigid old opinion of &s;ome Stoicks, who fancied &amp; taught not be grieved at

The &s;ence and tenderne&s;s whereof, wrought me to this Tran&s;lation: and remembred thereby, to prai&s;e and glorifie our good and gracious God, who hath pre&s;erved us from &s;uch calamities; and likewi&s;e hoping to encrea&s;e the number of re|lenting mindes, and charitable di&s;po&s;i|tions.

<HEAD>Of their Oratories.</HEAD>
<P>_THe fabricks of their Churches are &s;uf|ficiently large and &s;umptuous, and cal|led by the name of <HI>Me&s;chites:</HI> in which I never could perceive any &s;ort of fancies or imageries (for Idolatry is held by them the wor&s;t of abominations)
<PB N="2" REF="11">but onely the&s;e, or one of the&s;e in|&s;criptions following, in the Ara|bick Language, <HI>There is no God but one, and Mahomet his Prophet;</HI> or, <HI>One Creator and Prophets equal:</HI> or, <HI>None is &s;trong as God.</HI> Then there is &s;een a great abundance of burning Lamps, the whole Church whited, the Pavement covered with Mat|tre&s;&s;es, and on them the Ornaments of Tape&s;tries. Neer the Church, is erected a Tower of great height, to the top whereof the Prie&s;t a&s;|cends before the time of Prayers, and with a loud voice, his ears &s;topped with his fingers, he thrice proclaims the&s;e words; <HI>God, True, One:</HI> which Clamour or Outcry (for they have no Bells) being heard, the Nobility, and all unbu|&s;ied per&s;ons, repair to Church, as bound to that devotion. After|wards the &s;aid Prie&s;t de&s;cending, prays with them; (and then they turn their faces towards <HI>Mecha:)</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="11">And this he is tyed to do by his Of|fice, five times day and night. But who&s;oever cometh to the&s;e Pray|ers, mu&s;t wa&s;h his hands, his feet, and privities, and his head thrice &s;prinkled with water, and the&s;e words pronounced: <HI>Glory to my God.</HI> Then, their &s;hooes put off, and left at the Church-door, they enter in, &s;ome bare-footed, others having new Shooes or Socks, and &s;o ten|derly touch the ground. Women come not into Churches, as being not excis'd, and for fear of di&s;turb|ing mens devotions; but meet a|part in &s;evered places, altogether &s;hut off from eyes and ears of men; and more &s;eldome frequent their Churches, except in time of Pa&s;&s;e|over, or Ea&s;ter, and on Fridays; which days, from <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tra|ditions, for di&s;tinction and imita|tion, they almo&s;t re&s;pect as much as Jews their Sabbaths, or Chri&s;ti|ans the Lords day. They pray
<PB N="4" REF="12">from nine a clock at night till twelve; and in their praying, their bodies are ever in great motion and agitation, wherewith they marvelou&s;ly afflict them&s;elves, with loud cryings and fierce ejacu|lations; &s;o as oftentimes, their &s;trengths and &s;pirits failing, they &s;ink unto the ground; and if it hap|pen, any of them conceive her &s;elf with child, &s;he then a&s;&s;ures her &s;elf, that pregnancy proceeds from fa|vour of the Holy Spirit; and when delivered, the Infants born are cal|led, <HI>Sons,</HI> or <HI>Souls of the Holy Ghost.</HI> This hath been related to me from their Hand-maids; for I, nor ever any man el&s;e, were pre&s;ent at that &s;pectacle. At mens devotions I have been often pre&s;ent with my Ma&s;ter; who&s;e cu&s;tomes are in manner following: in their prayers they ne'er take off (their Turbants) coverings of their heads, but with the tops of their fingers gently
<PB N="5" REF="12">touch them, in token of taking them off; they fall upon their knees and often ki&s;s the ground: they hold it for great wickedne&s;s, to have a Chri&s;tian pre&s;ent at their my&s;teries; for they believe their Churches (as they &s;ay) to be polluted by men unwa&s;hed; and that Chri&s;tians u&s;e not &s;uch Lavatories. Every Church in <HI>Turky</HI> hath a peculiar place for Baths and wa&s;hings, with lodgings for a Prie&s;t. Now here the Prie&s;t a&s;cends his Pulpit (reads a piece of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and &s;ometimes expounds it) and there preaches a|bout two hours; his Sermon end|ed, two boyes come up to him, who pronounce their prayers &s;inging with re&s;pon&s;als; which Songs be|ing ended, the Prie&s;t with the whole People in a low voice, beat|ing upon their &s;ides, repeat the&s;e words, <HI>There is but one God;</HI> which for the &s;pace of half an hour they do, and &s;o depart. But this
<PB N="6" REF="13">manner of Prayers and Ceremonies of Preaching and &s;inging, are not done every day, unle&s;s in time of Lent, Fe&s;tivals, &s;ome Sundayes; and mo&s;t ob&s;erve the Fridayes for religious wor&s;hip.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their Lent.</HEAD>
<P>THey keep their Lent by fa&s;ting one Month and one Week e|very Year; but not alwayes the &s;ame: for if this Year they fa&s;t out <HI>January,</HI> the next they fa&s;t out <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> and keep on that cour&s;e; &s;o as in twelve Years &s;pace, they de|dicate to God (in lieu of tenths) one Year and twelve Weeks. Travel|lers and &s;ick Per&s;ons are excu&s;ed from pre&s;ent fa&s;tings; but are in|joyned to &s;upply it, by fa&s;ting &s;o many dayes at other times. When they fa&s;t, all that Day they ta&s;te nothing, not &s;o much as Bread or Water; then the Stars appearing,
<PB N="7" REF="13">it is lawful for them to eat of all things which are not &s;trangled, or Hoggs-fle&s;h, which they e&s;teem as carrion, mo&s;t unclean. Their Lent being pa&s;t, they ob&s;erve <HI>Ea|&s;ter</HI> for three dayes, with great &s;o|lemnity, anoynting the Nails of their Feet and Fingers with an Oyl which they call <HI>Chna,</HI> which maker tho&s;e Nails to &s;hine like Gold; and with the &s;ame, they &s;omtimes &s;tain or colour the Hoofs and Tails of Hor&s;es. This Tincture holds very long, &amp; can hardly be wip'd away; &s;o, as until new Nails thru&s;t out the old, they &s;till retain that dye: but Nails of the Hand, by frequent wa&s;hing, abate in time. Women do not onely anoynt the Nails, but their whole Hands and Feet al&s;o with that Oyl.</P>

<HEAD>Of their Circumci&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THey Circumci&s;e not on the eighth day, as the <HI>Jews</HI> do, but when the new-born arrive at the age of &s;even or eight yeers, and be of perfect &s;peech: the my&s;tery whereof, is from the words of con|fe&s;&s;ion required before circumci&s;i|on, which are &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;en|tences afore-mentioned in their Churches, which they repeat, and give a&s;&s;ent thereto, by hold|ing up the Thumbe of the right-Hand. The Youth is not for this my&s;tery brought unto their church, but is circumci&s;ed in his Parents Hou&s;e. I have been often pre&s;ent at this &s;olemnity, which is per|formed in manner following: fir&s;t, the friends are all invited to a fea&s;t, &s;ufficiently furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of delicate fle&s;h, lawful for them to eat; and almo&s;t everywhere, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="9" REF="14">among&s;t the wealthier &s;ort, an Ox is killed, bowelled, and flawed; in the body whereof, they include a Sheep; and in that Sheep, a Hen; and in her, an Egge; all which are entirely roa&s;ted toge|ther, for the &s;olemnity and &s;plen|dor of that day. Then in their Fea&s;t and time of Supper, the Boy that is to be circumci&s;ed, is brought to a Phy&s;itian skilful in that Art, who fixing between a pair of pinchers the fore-skin of his privie Member, to prevent all fear in the Boy, he telleth him, that the next day he will circumci&s;e him, and &s;o departs; but pre&s;ently feigning to have omitted &s;omething appertain|ing to this preparation, on a &s;udden he cuteth off the fore-skin, apply|ing thereunto a little &s;alt and bom|bace; and then he is called a <HI>Mu&s;&s;el|man,</HI> that is, one circumci&s;ed. Yet their Names are given the day of their Nativity, not Circumci&s;ion.
<PB N="10" REF="15">After continuance of this Fea&s;t for three dayes, the Boy with great pompe and &s;olemnity is accompa|nied to the Bathes; and being re|turned to his Hou&s;e, he is brought before the Gue&s;ts, and by them pre&s;ented with gifts prepared for him; &s;ome give Silver, Silken Ve&s;tments; &s;ome, Silver Cups; others, Money; and &s;ometimes, Hor&s;e. Women pre&s;ent him like|wi&s;e, &s;ome, with Shirts, Hand|kerchers, and &s;uch like, according to the &s;everal plea&s;ures and abilities of the Gue&s;ts. Women are not circumci&s;ed, onely they confe&s;s the afore&s;aid words, and &s;o made <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmen.</HI> And if any Chri&s;ti|an voluntarily confe&s;s a Faith in <HI>Mahomes,</HI> and &s;uffers Circumci&s;ion, (which often happens, by the heavy yoke and burthen of their Tri|bute) this Man is led through all the Streets and open places of the City, to the great joy and honour
<PB N="11" REF="15">of the people, with acclamations and ringing of Bells: him al&s;o they pre&s;ent with gifts, and after free him from all Tribute. For covetou&s;ne&s;s of this profit, many <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Albanes</HI> become cir|cumci&s;ed. But if any be forced thereto, as he that &s;hall &s;trike or otherwi&s;e di&s;grace a <HI>Mu&s;&s;elman,</HI> or bla&s;pheme <HI>Mahomet,</HI> (as it befel a certain <HI>Grecian Bi&s;hop</HI> which I did &s;ee) that man is circumci&s;ed, and hath nothing pre&s;ented to him, yet &s;hall be freed from Tribute as o|thers circumci&s;ed.</P>

The Army moveth at mid|night, and till mid-day following marcheth. The King rides be|tween two Ba&s;&s;a's talking with him, before whom marcheth &s;ome of the order of Janizaries on hor&s;e|back, bearing lighted Candles in time of night.

<PB N="87" REF="53">more ignominious; I my &s;elf, though never called to Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Function, undertook the charge of arguing this point of Piety with him; and &s;o a prefixed day was agreed on between us: when multitudes of people of each Reli|gion, came Spectators of the e|vent. The place was in a Mo|na&s;tery of <HI>Franci&s;cans;</HI> the day, <HI>Whit&s;on</HI>-Sunday, day of Penteco&s;t; where he moved to me fir&s;t this Que&s;tion: <HI>Where God had his being, before the Heavens and Earth, and therein all things el&s;e were created?</HI> Which Que&s;tion, though it &s;eemed to me not much pertinent to our purpo&s;e, yet le&s;t he &s;hould imagine us ignorant of our great God's uni|ver&s;al pre&s;ence, I &s;aid, He then was in his own being.

<P>This compari&s;on wrought in him a belief in God the Father, his onely begotten Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t; a Trinity in Unity. And when he had heard my weak di&s;|cour&s;es of God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Gho&s;t, he much admired, with &s;aying, <HI>O God, O God; I, nor any of our Sect, could ever imagine, you had &s;uch good thoughts of God; for we conceive you live in darkne&s;s of under&s;tanding: but by your relation, it &s;eems you have great apprehen&s;ions of him; and be|lieve well, if you did not neglect our great Prophet of God,</HI> Mahomet.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>A Lamentation for lo&s;s of Chri&s;tians de&s;troyed.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AFflicted with an infinite and in|credible &s;orrow (mo&s;t high and mighty Mo|narchs and Go|vernours of Chri&s;tian Commonwealths) to &s;ee the &s;ad condition, and mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable being of our Brethren under the Turki&s;h &s;lavery; whereof &s;ome &s;educed from the bo&s;ome of our
<PB N="98" REF="59">Church to heretical unhappine&s;s; others with civil and ho&s;ti&s;e &s;word, &s;lain, murthered, and ca&s;t to de|vouring Bea&s;ts; others made cap|tive to perpetual &s;ervitude, and mo&s;t cruelly afflicted. They all by me in lamentable &s;obs and groanings complain, O mon&s;trous, mi&s;chievous ambition of ill men, and wicked covetou&s;ne&s;s of ruling! How many equal &s;ouls con&s;ecrated to God's Divine Wor&s;hip, have you betrayed to Death and to the Devil? How many Principalities and Kingdoms of great Kings, and all &s;orts of Nobility, have you de|&s;troyed? How many walls of &s;tate|ly Towns have you demoli&s;hed? How many &s;umptuous Palaces and &s;trong &s;tately Ca&s;tles have you levelled with the ground? How many lawful Owners have you de|jected from eminent E&s;tates and quiet Conditions, and bani&s;hed to perpetual di&s;con&s;olations?</P>
<PB N="99" REF="59">
<P>And although I intend not to write the acts of Princes, but to delineate the calamities and trage|dies of Captives, I cannot forbear remembrance of that abomina|ble di&s;cord of the Earl of <HI>Scrvia,</HI> a potent and proud Prince, who a|greeing (a &s;hameful foul example of a vitious ambition) with the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> (his neighbour-E|nemy) and having many Ca&s;tles and &s;trong holds upon the Turki&s;h Confines, even to the River <HI>Savus,</HI> (which divides <HI>Illyria</HI> from <HI>Croatia</HI>) and defended all tho&s;e Provinces which lye between that River and the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> from Turki&s;h violences and incur&s;ions: This Earl or Lord of <HI>Servia,</HI> falling into variance and &s;ome petty contro|ver&s;ies with the Nobility of <HI>Scla|vonia,</HI> made friend&s;hip with the &s;aid Ba&s;&s;a, and joyning their Ar|mies both together, invaded the <HI>Sclavonians,</HI> partly at difference be|tween
<PB N="100" REF="60">them&s;elves, and partly im|potent; wholly de&s;troys them and their Province with fire and &s;word, ruining their Towns and Ca&s;tles, &s;ome by violence and force, &s;ome by craft and treachery, (cu&s;tomary with wicked men and Turks) and &s;o totally vanqui&s;hed and con|quered them. And after a few Months had pa&s;&s;ed, this Ba&s;&s;a be|holding the Earl's rich Provinces, and neighbouring with his, he took or made occa&s;ions to invade him, whom at length he kill'd; and &s;o reduced all his Territories under the Turki&s;h Government. Thus this &s;editious Athei&s;t, Traytor to his Country and his Brethren, mo&s;t ignominiou&s;ly lo&s;t his life: for &s;uch are the Turk's rewards to whom&s;oever by craft, policy, or villanous fraud, he can lay hold on or en&s;nare. The like was done with &s;ome Noble-men of <HI>Hungary,</HI> whom they reduced to mi&s;erable captivity.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="60">
<P>Wherefore (mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Mo|narchs) the cruelties of this Ty|rant, ought with all indu&s;try and vigilance, be both feared and pre|vented; le&s;t con&s;idering your fair Provinces, and viewing them with a fa&s;cinating eye, he finde you di&s;|agreeing, and thereby infeebled, he a&s;&s;ault you on all &s;ides, not onely <HI>Candia, Calabria, Malta,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> but even <HI>Italy, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and prove an univer&s;al &s;courge and terror to all Chri&s;ten|dome.

But not to trouble you in this kinde, I recommend to you, mo&s;t prudent Governours, the correction and a|mendment of this great error, and return to the deplorable calamities and afflictions our Brethren &s;uffer under the yoke of Tribute in the Turk's Dominions, where &s;ome

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>An Exhortation again&s;t the</HI> TURK.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have often mar|velled with my &s;elf, mo&s;t mighty Monarchs, when I con&s;idered the adva~tages which promi&s;e Chri&s;ti|ans victories again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> and yet in&s;o many yeers they attempted none, or failed. We have Je&s;us Chri&s;t our God, who in one onely night de&s;troyed the ho&s;t of <HI>Sennacherib;</HI> who drowned <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> who with
<PB N="110" REF="65">a maiden hand of <HI>Judith,</HI> &s;truck off th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> head of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">phernes;</HI> and, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> a God, who&s;e will is victory. Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ary to which, they have a <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> a wicked man of life &amp; con|ver&s;ation, in death, yet hanging in his Sepulchre without Re&s;urrecti|on: &s;o as there is as much difference between them, as is between an ever living Son of an ever living God, and a putrid carka&s;s of a &s;on of a mortal man; that if we diligently examine the nature of each Power and Authority, it would apear like dead men, &s;uperi|ors in &s;trength to living. Now in abilities of bodies, capacities, and gifts of under&s;tanding, we exceed them; which are good &s;trengths and fortifications again&s;t an enemy: and yet we are &s;till defeated. Who is more hardy then the <HI>Hungarian?</HI> more &s;tout and robu&s;tious then the <HI>German?</HI> more quick and nimble then the <HI>Frenchmen?</HI> more grave
<PB N="111" REF="65">and &s;olid then the <HI>Spaniard?</HI> more cautelous and prudent then the <HI>Ita|lian?</HI> more valiant and daring then the <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI> forbearing other Na|tions, the endowments of who&s;e mindes, are better or at lea&s;t equal. All the&s;e abilities &s;eem able &s;ingly to get a victory, or at lea&s;t well to forward it. Courage often with|out much force, genero&s;ity of minde, wi&s;dom, foreca&s;t, ambition of honour, and policy, oft &s;ubdues an Enemy; yet notwith&s;tanding, wretches as we are, among&s;t &s;o ma|ny victorious attributes, we get no victories. Then if we con&s;ider the ea&s;ie preparation &amp; great furnitures of all &s;orts of arms, we &s;hall appear far to exceed the Turk. Guns of all &s;orts have bin our own inventions, and the divers kindes of compleat harne&s;&s;es for hor&s;e and foot. The Turks, Per&s;ians Subjects, naked, or half &s;o, march forth to war: they have bows, we guns; that is, fire
<PB N="112" REF="66">and thunder: they have arrows, which hardly pierce an Armour; we Cannons, which Rocks cannot with&s;tand: and yet now &s;ome <HI>Mu&s;&s;el-men</HI> have Guns and Gunners; but few, and unskilful.</P>
<P>Now I pray, what other kinde of people u&s;e they mo&s;t in Expe|ditions? <HI>Scythians</HI> and <HI>Thracians,</HI> who have no <HI>Italian</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Spirits, onely a kinde of inhumane fiercene&s;s, ignorance and &s;tolidi|ty: to the&s;e are added <HI>Grecians,</HI> lo&s;t men with ea&s;e and lazine&s;s; <HI>A&s;ians,</HI> corrupt with luxury; <HI>Ae|gyptians,</HI> no le&s;s in minde then bo|dies, feebled; <HI>Arabians,</HI> bloodle&s;s, thin, and parboyl'd with the Sun. Who could imagine &s;uch-kinde of Souldiery &s;hould &s;ubdue the great advantages and abilities of tho&s;e fore named Nations? yet (be it &s;poken with grief) our Chri&s;tians by the&s;e are overcome, and ma|&s;tered into &s;ervitude, and our great
<PB N="113" REF="66">Captains are forced to bear arms a|gain&s;t us, who were born and bred by Ance&s;tors to liberty: and in the mean &s;ea&s;on, the <HI>Turk</HI> laughs at us, and the <HI>Jew</HI> rejoyceth.</P>
<P>Now if I &s;hall con&s;ider the Laws and In&s;titutions of Nations, we &s;hall be found abundantly &s;uperiour in that re&s;pect: for, what is more righ|teous and divine then the Deca|logue and holy Go&s;pel, written by God's own Finger and his Spirit? what more regular then the Canon-Law? more ju&s;t and equal then the civil Law? Whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> live by Direction &amp; Dictates of the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> a book of &s;tuff as fooli&s;h, as full of vanity; a book of &s;port and mirth, if pity for the &s;educed did not allay it; though now &s;pread abroad too much, and handled a|mong&s;t Chri&s;tians; &s;o as it may be truely feared, we &s;hall learn other Laws, or &s;hortly lo&s;e our own, and turn <HI>Turks</HI> in our mindes and
<PB N="114" REF="67">approbations, &s;ooner then in our bodies to their Dominion. What is then the cau&s;e, having &s;o many prerogatives of hopeful war, we are alwayes beaten? why are our En&s;igns adorn'd with Crucifixes, fearful formerly to infidels and de|vils, now trampled on &amp; frighted? I &s;hall tell you in few words, and truth, We have a God mo&s;t great, mo&s;t good; but alienated from us &s;o far, that according to the Prophets &s;aying, <HI>We &s;carce are to be named his people:</HI> for why &s;hould Chri&s;t re|main with us, whom we have rent and torn in far more pieces, then the Souldiers did his Garment, by our hideous Sects, Schi&s;mes and Here|&s;ies? Be&s;ides his Name, what of him is dear unto us? The very Plow man the&s;e times is impudent and factious, the Citizen fraudu|lent and avaritious, the Magi&s;trate &s;eeks retributions and rewards, the Nobility is riotous and lazy, the
<PB N="115" REF="67">Gentry contentious and proud; the Souldier, beyond his pay and &s;poil, craves nothing from the war; let Scepters fall as they will, he is no le&s;s grievous to friends and compa|nions, then Enemies. Church-men be&s;ides pomp eccle&s;ia&s;tical, have lit|tle of the Church; not &s;anctity, not piety, &amp; &s;ome not fitting erudition; &s;eeking their own, not Chri&s;t's ad|vancement; that we may &s;ay with the Prophet, <HI>All have declin'd the ways of God, and are unprofitable; there's none that doth good, not, even one.</HI> Why &s;hould we marvel then that Chri&s;t is not our Friend? We therefore go to war without a God, and what is more calamitous, with God our ad|ver&s;ary. We carry Bibles &amp; Cruci|fixes with us, but the crucified by his favour conver&s;eth with our ene|mies; our actions therefore peri&s;h, &amp; are involv'd in lo&s;&s;es And when one Nation fights again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> another is imploy'd in civil wars,
<PB N="116" REF="68">calling to his aid, Pagans, Schi&s;ma|ticks or Hereticks, more eagerly to oppo&s;e Chri&s;t; others tend their home-affairs, to indulge them&s;elvs in ea&s;e &amp; voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. The &s;oul|dier &s;ets not forth for Chri&s;t, but money; which failing, &s;oon de&s;erts the field, &amp; turns home back again. What have we then from tho&s;e rich Attributes &amp; Eulogies of <HI>Ger|many, France, England, Spain,</HI> &amp; <HI>Italy,</HI> when the Souldier neglects both God and Honour, and goes to war, as to market, a brothel-hou&s;e, or &s;tews, to exerci&s;e all rapine, &s;poil, and lewdne&s;s? We have good laws, but evil manners; good furniture of arms, but wicked di&s;po&s;itions: it is our glory to fight among our &s;elves; and if we prove coward to enemies, there follows little &s;hame or puni&s;hment. When do we &s;ee a Souldier quitting Colours or di&s;|banding, &s;everely handled? which crimes were anciently capital; and
<PB N="117" REF="68">whole Legions have been deci|mated and tyth'd for le&s;s offences. We therefore march with men few in numbers, and tho&s;e corrupt in manners, again&s;t millions of men well di&s;ciplin'd; for <HI>Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ks</HI> leave their vices in their hou&s;es, from whence we carry ours.

What wonder then if they conquer who are pre&s;erved by &s;obriety, par&s;imony, diligence, fidelity, and obedience? Let them peri&s;h then, who lo&s;e a field to get a prey; who are oftner found among&s;t whores, and drunk, then in good actions: but 'tis the fault and error of Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">iors, when Subjects are not kept in due ob&s;ervance; which if Chri&s;tians were, we could not be inferiour to
<PB N="118" REF="69"><HI>Turks.</HI> And yet a greater fault, be|hold, Princes them&s;elves, while they contend in mutual quarrels, are cau&s;es why they cannot mu&s;ter equal forces again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> for whil&s;t they fight and combate for &s;ome little Town or other, after grievous &s;trife, conflictation and exhau&s;tion of men and trea&s;ure, they grow weak, impoveri&s;hed and heartle&s;s. What brave actions might tho&s;e &s;treams of Chri&s;tian blood have done, which civil wars mo&s;t impiou&s;ly have drawn out, emptied, and dried up?

<P>Now, mo&s;t mighty Monarchs and high Governours, for God's cau&s;e, bani&s;h from among&s;t you all di&s;|cord &amp; ambitious tyrannies (which are the Devils in&s;truments to main|tain oppre&s;&s;ions &amp; impieties, there|by to prolong Gods wrath upon you) and re&s;tore to each proprietor his due rights and priviledges; and then, as Rivers having free cour&s;e, ha&s;te all &s;moothly to the &s;ea, &amp; make one mighty body; &s;o your &s;trengths united in the bond of peace, would &s;tartle, a&s;toni&s;h and drown this great Tyrant <HI>Turk:</HI> which ble&s;&s;ing on bended knees, I humbly pray

<PB N="122" REF="71">God being plea&s;ed, and our lives amended, the&s;e enemies of our faith would ea&s;ily be trodden down. All <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Thrace,</HI> (where yet great part retain the law of Chri&s;t) expect with greedine&s;s the Chri&s;ti|an Sword, and readily would re|volt upon &s;uch occa&s;ion, and man|fully a&s;&s;ault and fight again&s;t tho&s;e Lords and Ma&s;ters, that have &s;o cruelly afflicted them: which cir|cum&s;tance alone, would much ha&s;ten, if not perfect a &s;peedy victory.</P>
<P>I would to God, and wi&s;h hearti|ly, mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Monarchs, That your civil, fruitle&s;s, home-conten|tions, would permit and &s;uffer you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, and calmly to examine the&s;e offered motions; you then would finde all mens wills and arms concur with yours; no age, no &s;ex, no conditions of men would leave your En&s;igns: Each <HI>Turk</HI> would have his Execu|tioner
<PB N="123" REF="71">at home, his Traytor in his Tent, and fugitive in the field.

And when&s;oever it &s;hall plea&s;e God to root out from among&s;t us the&s;e perpetual E|nemies of his faith, and &s;end them to their old lurking holes and caves, and corners in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> by the Chri&s;tian Sword, (according to &s;ome of their own Prophecies) or el&s;e to reduce them to the bo|&s;ome of our Catholick Church; no man can doubt, but in &s;hort time the Emperor will be &s;eated in his chair at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and inve&s;ted in his Imperial Roman Territories; The King of <HI>Romans</HI> re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and recover <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Thrace; France,</HI> le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia; Eng|land,</HI>

<P>The&s;e are the apprehen&s;ions of all Chri&s;tian captives under the Turki&s;h Tribute, and even Turks them&s;elves, who have knowledge and long acquaintance in military affairs. And this my &s;elf have learned by thirteen yeers experi|ence, The <HI>Turk</HI> is valiant again&s;t a flying, and flying again&s;t a valiant Enemy; when therefore he by nature is fugitive, impiety flyes without pur&s;uit. Let God ari&s;e and &s;catter all his Enemies: let tho&s;e that hate his Doctrine, a|void his pre&s;ence: let them like &s;moak vani&s;h, and melt like wax again&s;t the fire: &s;o may all Infidels peri&s;h, before the face of God and his holy Church, that
