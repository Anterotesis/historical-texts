<HEAD>REASONS <HI>humbly Offered again&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;hing the pre&s;ent</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Compa|ny by Act of Parliament, exclu&s;ive of others, and confirming their Charters.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BEcau&s;e that all the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> have an equal Right to Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> by the Laws of the Land, and which the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons have lately Declared and A&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P N="2">II. Becau&s;e that the E&s;tabli&s;hing this Company would give away that Right to a few Men only, which belongs to all the Subjects of <HI>England;</HI> and thereby exclude all the re&s;t from it for 21 Years.</P>
<P N="3">III. Becau&s;e that this Honourable Hou&s;e have in two Se&s;&s;ions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Parliament made two Solemn Addre&s;&s;es to have this Company Di&s;&s;olved, it's humbly &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;ed, Their being E&s;tabli&s;hed contrary to their &s;aid Addre&s;&s;es, cannot be thought Merit &s;ufficient to recom|mend them to &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Becau&s;e it would be &s;o great a Service to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to have a Company E&s;tabli&s;ht on &s;o ill a Foundation; which would be &s;o much le&s;s able to conte&s;t with them in that Trade, than a New Company founded on a National Bottom, with a clear Stock of Two Millions; that the <HI>Dutch</HI> might afford to furni&s;h the Money, which is propo&s;ed to be advanced for.</P>
<P N="5">V. Becau&s;e that the confirming this Companies Charter, would give them &s;uch Powers as are not fit to be tru&s;ted in any Subjects; much le&s;s in tho&s;e who have already &s;o much abu&s;ed them, and by colour thereof have been guilty of &s;uch Arbitrary Proceedings, as well on the Lives, Liberties and E&s;tates of their Fellow-Subjects, as to the Natives of <HI>India:</HI> and for &s;ome of which, they have been ju&s;tly Cen&s;ured in Parliament.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Becau&s;e that it would countenance by a Law, one of the greate&s;t Cheats that ever yet was practi&s;ed; and that only to &s;erve the Private Ends of a few Men, who have been the Promoters of it; and by their Arts and Tricks have procured New Sub&s;criptions to be made to their Old Stock, which they knew was worth nothing: and the better to Decoy in others, have given Security, to &s;ome to make their 90 <HI>l.</HI> worth 100 <HI>l.</HI> in 6 Months time.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Becau&s;e this Propo&s;al is not made by the Company, or with their Con&s;ent, nor &s;o much as a General Court called, to propo&s;e it to them; but is managed and promoted by tho&s;e Security-Men, who now want the Credit of an Act of Parliament: to make them a &s;aving Bargain, by rai&s;ing the Stock: that &s;o they may either Sell out, or not have it put upon them with &s;o great a Lo&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Becau&s;e there is no a&s;&s;urance, that this Propo&s;al will be complied with; for many of the Adventurers are &s;o far from approving of it, that they publickly expre&s;s their di&s;like thereof. So that if it &s;hould be offered by the Hou&s;e, it may not perhaps be accepted.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Becau&s;e it would E&s;tabli&s;h in a few Men of the Old Company, the greate&s;t part of all that Trade, and give them, and &s;uch only as they plea&s;e, the whole Power and Management of it; as they have had for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, and have now lately &s;ecured to them&s;elves by their New Charter; by reducing the Votes from 500 <HI>l.</HI> to 1000 <HI>l.</HI> and having ten Votes for 10000 <HI>l.</HI> which the New Sub&s;cribers would now gladly retrieve; and to that end have made Regulations, which the Governing-Men will not agree to: and the New Sub&s;cribers and the Old di&s;agreeing about their New Regulations, if any of them them &s;hould get into the Committee at the Election in <HI>April</HI> next, they may perhaps be too nice in examining into the Particulars of the large Articles expended for <HI>Secret Service,</HI> and di&s;cover the mi&s;erable &s;tate of the Companys condition; which would occa&s;ion the Stock to fall, unle&s;s it can be thus Supported.</P>
<P N="10">X. Becau&s;e, that at the Return of the two Ships, which were &s;ent to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> by particular Men la&s;t year, the true &s;tate of the Companies Condition will then appear; and the fear of the con&s;equence of having the truth thereof di&s;covered, which they know is &s;o bad, is the great Rea&s;on, That they are now &s;o Solicitous to obtain an E&s;tabli&s;hment by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Becau&s;e no other Rea&s;ons are given by tho&s;e who promote the Confirming this Com|pany, for &s;o doing; but only their Lending 60000 <HI>l.</HI> without Intere&s;t to be advanced in three Years, and be Re-paid out of their own Cu&s;toms: Which by a rea&s;onable Computation cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to near &s;o much as they have Paid for <HI>Secret Service,</HI> but is neverthele&s;s more than they can perform, unle&s;s their Friends the <HI>Dutch</HI> help them to it, or that they procure others to Lend it for them: a Practice with which they have been well acquainted, when they have pretended to make Loans to Their Maje&s;ties; and have lately given by their Emi&s;&s;aries, 1 or 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than the King Paid, to procure the Mo|ney to be lent in their Members Names, by tho&s;e who otherwi&s;e would have lent it to the Go|vernment them&s;elves without any &s;uch Compen&s;ation, &s;o that the Publick has had no Advan|tage by their pretended Loans.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Becau&s;e that this is not a rai&s;ing of Money for the Crown, but only a Borrowing of it, by anticipating the Revenue which is already Granted.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Becau&s;e, that if the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould incline (which it's hum|bly hoped they will not) to Confirm this Company, with an Exclu&s;ion of the Right of all the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> whom this Honourable Hou&s;e repre&s;ents; only for their Lending 600000 <HI>l.</HI> If the &s;ame Method were to be taken in Rai&s;ing Money on other Foreign Trades of this Kingdom, &s;everal Millions might be Rai&s;ed thereby; and there are Per&s;ons who would make Propo&s;als for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade to be Settled in a New Company, far more Con&s;i|derable and Advantageous to the Publick, than what are now made for the Old Company.</P>
