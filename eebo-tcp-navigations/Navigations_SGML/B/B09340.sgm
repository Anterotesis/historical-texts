<HEAD>TO THE LADIES.</HEAD>
<P>_YO&V; have in this Romance in <HI>Querpo</HI> (although I believe having read it, you will allow it a better Title, and at least, &s;wear 'tis pity it was not True) the perfect Repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of <HI>Innocence;</HI> I don't mean the time when our fir&s;t Parents, for want of Drapers, made u&s;e of Leaves, but the Age that not long after follow'd; in which <HI>Love,</HI> which is now made a piece of Art, was Natural; when Mens Affections were not bya&s;s'd with the De&s;ire of a great E&s;tate, and without huge heaps of Gold were contented with the innocent light|ne&s;s of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, I mean that Air, Mine and Gayety they e&s;teem'd, and did not as we do, cen&s;ure their &s;prightly Ge&s;tures, as if Mirth and Hone&s;ty were incon&s;istent. Then how would they have laugh'd to hear
<PB REF="5">of a Lady, that made her Servant follow the Sent two whole Years, when perhaps &s;he is more in love with the Gallant, than he with her, who in his api&s;h Ap|prenti&s;hip (for he must be a Slave to her Will) has &s;pent more Money in the <HI>Mulberry Garden,</HI> and the <HI>Parks,</HI> than would build an <HI>Ho&s;pital;</HI> has &s;een more <HI>Plays</HI> than are good, and been acquainted with all the Coach-men in Town; who&s;e E&s;tate at last being &s;pent <HI>Victoria, Victoria,</HI> the Day's our own, he at last has vanqui&s;h'd his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Affections, is marry'd, and with her Portion is just flu&s;h'd for the vi&s;it of another Lady; and then who can blame our <HI>Prophetick Gentlewomen?</HI> They are like to enjoy little Plea&s;ure, after the Man in black has conjur'd them together, except to tell how many <HI>Rheni&s;h-wine</HI> Gla&s;&s;es have been drank in drinking her <HI>Health,</HI> by the Good-man her Husband, whow is now perhaps, lest he &s;hould for|get his Court&s;hip, paying his <HI>Devoirs</HI> to new Madam; I know the Ladies having read it (But not for the good of the Book-&s;eller, let us contrive how that may be; why, it is but feeing the Chambermaid to pretend Ignorance, and get the Foot Boy-to buy her the new Book of the Maid that was &s;o Blind as to Lo&s;e her &s;elf in a <HI>Moon &s;hine Night,</HI> and then convey it to her Lady, who will by the Title, expect it &s;hould be horrible Bawdy, when a &s;tarch'd Puritan I think would not groan in Spirit to be call'd the Owner of it) I &s;ay the Ladies that read it will be cur&s;ed an|gry with me, that <HI>Myrtilla</HI> was &s;o ea&s;ily gain'd, and that &s;he did not, like our fooli&s;h Females, oppo&s;e, what &s;he most de&s;ir'd. For the first I dare oppo&s;e
<PB REF="5">her Con&s;tancy to any of their Lady&s;hips; and for the other, you &s;hall &s;ee I am &s;o much a Gentleman, as to help a young Lady over the Stile. I know her Accu&s;ers Argument is, that &s;he ought to have taken &s;ome time to try her Servants Affection; but pray direct me to that fooli&s;h Fop (and I'le procure him a Mi&s;tre&s;s of Clouts, for he de&s;erves no better) who when he is wooing, will offer to be deficient in his Duty, that will quarrel at an angry look, and will threaten to bang her if &s;he will not &s;ay &s;he loves, which is as ridiculous to think, as that a lame Beg|gar &s;hould Hector out an Alms. For my part, I think our <HI>Myrtilla</HI> is to be commended for her Policy, &s;he does by this oblige her Lover, and he must bely the &s;hape of a man, and be wor&s;e than a Devil, that will wrong a Lady that &s;o confidently commits her Honour to his keeping. Well, however the Ladies quarrel at me and <HI>Myrtilla, Circe</HI> and I &s;hall be &s;ure to &s;cape with the Chambermaids, their good hearts will only envy a little her fortune, and it may be &s;ay their Prayers every Night, and lie cro&s;s-legg'd in expecta|tion of the like.</P>
<P>It is now fit to tell you why I undertook this harm|le&s;s piece of Mirth, which was for this Rea&s;on; I &s;aw how well one Story out of the &s;ame Authour took, beeing turn'd into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that is out of the incompa|rable <HI>Erycius Puteanus,</HI> and thinking this no way infe|riour to it in it &s;elf, having nothing to do, I adventur'd upon the Tran&s;lation of it. I confe&s;s it comes &s;o &s;hort of the Pen of that ingenious per&s;on that wrote the other, that fear I have done the witty <HI>Italian</HI> an unpardo|nable
<PB REF="6">Injury in daring to render it &s;o pitifully. But to excu&s;e him of all tho&s;e faults my Tran&s;lation may make him &s;eem guilty of, I a&s;&s;ure you the Cloaths are my own; If you ask why I made 'em no better, I a&s;&s;ure you I could not, 'twas done for the afore&s;aid Rea&s;on to avoid idlene&s;s, and then I think I am a little more excu&s;able, than the per&s;on that having no|thing to do, went and hir'd in the Market a Drudgery at the expence of a great Sum. If I have offended the Ladies, I beg their pardon, and a&s;&s;ure them that I am their</P>

<HEAD>THE MAIDEN-HEAD LOST BY Moon-light. OR, <HI>The Adventure of the Meadow.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_MY little Skill in Geography will not let me give you any better Account, then that in part of the Dominions of the great <HI>Comus,</HI> dwelt a young Gentleman, by Name <HI>Chere&s;tratus;</HI> I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf nor you with a tedious Relation of his Ance&s;tors, and how many of them were <HI>Lord Mayors;</HI> but I am &s;omething like a Woman, and now I think, on't can't but tell you that one of them was hang'd, which I had not done, but that I thought it would not be any di&s;paragement to him, who was
<PB N="2" REF="7">&s;o well accompli&s;h'd, that his fir&s;t actions had quitted the di&s;grace had they all &s;uffer'd the like fate; He was not at all behind hand with the Gallants of the&s;e times, either for Learning or Valour, be&s;ides Sing|ing, and compo&s;ing of Madrigals, which &s;eemed in tho&s;e days to have been in great u&s;e; for the Ladies being not over coy, were not &s;o great Enemies to the Progre&s;s of Mu&s;ick, as to deny them&s;elves or Servant the plea&s;ure of an early <HI>Serenade,</HI> which the next day was rewarded with &s;ome &s;ignal favour, except the Lady &s;o courted had been wak'd out of &s;ome plea&s;ant Dream, and then too &s;he dur&s;t hardly chide, for fear left being out with the men (who where chiefly concern'd in the Comedy) her Dream &s;hould prove but a Dream, and &s;he &s;hould never be made happy with the Reality. Be&s;ides this, he could Dance incomparably well, by which the Ladies might ghe&s;s he had not been under the Surgeon's hands, nor had much skill in <HI>Maiden heads</HI> (a thing very much to be deplor'd in our days, for our Gal|lants not finding the fir&s;t night what they look for (but they are fools that do) &s;eldome continue Lo|ving above the fir&s;t Month; and &s;eem not &s;o much to be married as to keep a Mi&s;tre&s;s with a little more Ceremony. I am loath to tell you that with the&s;e Perfections he was rich, for I would be unwilling to put in any thing that might make you &s;u&s;pect the truth of this Relation, and I am &s;ure you will never believe, that a per&s;on &s;o well accompli&s;h'd, and of a &s;ufficient E&s;tate &s;hould find &s;o cruel a Lady, as not to admit of his Addre&s;&s;es. But you mu&s;t con&s;ider the
<PB N="3" REF="7">time which according to the be&s;t Chronologers was in <HI>Tire&s;ias</HI>'s days, and the women would not deny his Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That they take as much plea&s;ure or more in doing the Gentleman a good turn&punc; than the per&s;on that receiv'd it, This made the Ladies then, contrary to what they are now a days, count it an unpardonable Sin to take a Reward for their mutual plea&s;ures, and this made <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> not prove &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfull in his Amours, as he might have done had he liv'd now.</P>
<P>But to come to the Story, it was the unhappine&s;s of this incomparable Gallant, to place his Affection on a Per&s;on that di&s;dain'd his frequent Suits, which &s;he did with a kind of Reluctancy, for &s;he her &s;elf nor any body el&s;e could tell why &s;he would not let him pay his <HI>Devoirs</HI> to her, as well as any other Gal|lant of the Town, to whom he was no way inferiour. But the my&s;teries of Love are as blind as him&s;elf, who&s;e hidden Cau&s;es can never be under&s;tood, and I &s;hould rather be content to be kept in ignorance, then endeavour of a di&s;covery of <HI>Medea's Video me|liora proboque, Deteriora &s;equor.</HI> However the Lady continued very ob&s;tinate, whether becau&s;e &s;he was prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Love of <HI>Hyleus</HI> (Rival only in Love to our noble <HI>Chere&s;tratus,</HI> for, for other things he could not &s;tand in competition with him) or for &s;ome other Rea&s;on, I know not. For I do not think that the comparing of a Ladie's Favours to Shadows always holds true, for then <HI>Hyleus</HI> had been as un|happy as our unfortunate Gentleman, who ply'd his Bu&s;ine&s;s as hotly as <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly do.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<P>By this time <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> was grown a perfect Vo|tary of Love, which made him like the re&s;t of that mad Religion abandon the &s;ociety of men, and en|deavouring as it were to be free from him&s;elf, he would often be &s;inging &s;ome lamentable Ditty, of which he had &s;tore, but above all, this was the chief:
<Q><L><HI>Whatever I think or whatever I do,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My</HI> Phillis <HI>is &s;till in my mind:</HI></L>
<L><HI>When in anger I mean not to</HI> Phillis <HI>to go</HI></L>
<L><HI>My feet of them&s;elves the way find,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now you'l &s;ay this is very like a modern Song of ours, but I a&s;&s;ure you what follows, could I but re|member it, was not at all like it, and it was only by chance, that he thought of the fir&s;t Stave, for it is certain there are common notions, which are obvious to all that make upon the &s;ame Subject. In hitting on which &s;ome have been &s;o happy, that they have wrote whole Poems, and things of greater bulk &s;o like other men, that if compar'd, it was not ea&s;ily told which was which. But let this pa&s;s, &s;ometimes you &s;hould have our <HI>Inamorato</HI> under the reverend &s;hade of a well &s;pread Oak, be&s;eeching it's &s;en&s;ele&s;s Divinity to give him leave to in&s;cribe the Name of his dear <HI>Myrtilla</HI> there (for &s;o was the hard-hearted Lady call'd,) and then taking out a Pen Knife, which had never been put to any &s;ervile office, as cutting of Corns, or the like, he ingraves on the bark with flou|ri&s;hing Letters, which &s;earce a Writing Ma&s;ter in tho&s;e parts could mend, the Name of his Saint. This
<PB N="5" REF="8">done like a meer heatheni&s;h Gentleman he falls down, and wor&s;hips the work of his own hands; then with a tedious Harangue he twits the poor Tree in the teeth of the benefit he had done it, &s;aying that it &s;hould be now more famous for bearing the Name of the incomparable <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> then it was for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and that were not corn yet found out, he might not at all fear a rape of his ripe Acorns, for as &s;oon as people came, and &s;aw tho&s;e Letters, rapt up in admiration, they would forget to eat, and with fixed eyes gaze till &s;ome envious Dryades forc'd 'em from their De|votion. Be&s;ides the&s;e works of &s;upererogation, our Gallant (which was the only comfort he had) was almo&s;t continually walking by the door of the cruel Lady, whom he &s;eem'd to watch or rather guard with as much diligence, as <HI>Argus</HI> did <HI>Io,</HI> or the mortify'd Gho&s;t of &s;ome lately departed U&s;urer his mu&s;ty baggs, but yet he dur&s;t not (as being forbid by his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and fearing to di&s;plea&s;e her) hang Garlands at her Po&s;ts &s;o artificially woven with Enigmatical Flowers, that &s;he might there read his fervent af|fection. This and &s;everal other Love-tricks that the Youths of tho&s;e times us'd, to accompli&s;h their wi&s;hes, he was forc'd to forbear.</P>
<P>His Friends by this began to have &s;mall hopes of his E&s;tate, or Legacies; for his not eating nor drink|ing any thing, made them &s;u&s;pect he was grown im|mortal. Among&s;t the re&s;t of his acquaintance one <HI>Paneutus</HI> a Yeoman ith' Country &s;ome ten miles of the City where our pining Lover now was, hearing of the deplorable condition his Friend lay in, and

<PB N="7" REF="9">
<P>This Letter in <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI>'s ab&s;ence, arriv'd at his City Hou&s;e, who was ju&s;t now gone, as his cu&s;tome was, to take a view of his Lady's Lodgings, which he did &s;o eagerly, that he had like to have paid for his gaping. For &s;ome of the Neighbours ob&s;erving him how narrowly he ey'd the Hou&s;e, thinking he had &s;ome bad de&s;ign, acquainted the old Gentlewoman, Mother to the young Lady; who could hardly be per&s;waded from carrying our Gallant before the Ju&s;tice, to which her Daughter encourag'd her, which went to the very heart of <HI>Chere&s;tratus,</HI> for &s;he knew well enough though &s;he &s;eem'd ignorant of the cau&s;e. But the old Lady, having no witne&s;s to prove any thing, di&s;mi&s;s'd him, with a &s;evere charge never to trouble her door again. What remains now to the de&s;perate Lover, but to make away with him|&s;elf, and fall a Sacrifice to her di&s;dain? which cer|tainly he had done, had not his ha&s;ty de&s;ire to vi&s;it <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> Hou&s;e made him forget to put on his Sha&s;h, that morning. A thou&s;and mi&s;erable thoughts offer'd them&s;elves to him in his way home, whither he was no &s;ooner come, but throwing him&s;elf upon his Bed, he began to bewail his hard fortune, with tears and &s;ighs. Scarce had he begun his Soliloquy, but his Ser|vant came into the Room, and pre&s;ented him with the Letter; which having read, and taking a turn or two in the Chamber, the reflecting on his Lady's inci|vilities made him re&s;olve to accept his Friend's Offer. To which end &s;etling his Hou&s;hold Affairs, he com|mands all things to be made ready for his next days intended Journey, which accordingly he took, wi&s;ely
<PB N="8" REF="10">choo&s;ing rather to ride a mile about, then to come by <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> Hou&s;e, by which he &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed; being &s;afe come to his journey's end we will leave him with his merry Friend <HI>Paneutus,</HI> who entertain'd him with all the kindne&s;s imaginable, always en|deavouring his diver&s;ion with &s;ome pa&s;time, as Hawk|ing, Hunting, and the like, and return to <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> who&s;e Mother you mu&s;t know, knowing what care and caution is to be us'd over young Maids, made the Daughter grow weary of her Government, counting it too &s;evere, as depriving her of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures that young Ladies would willingly accept of. For her Mother keeping a Dairy would often &s;et her to make Butter and Chee&s;e for fear of the green Sickne&s;s, which he knew how to cure as well as any Doctor in <HI>Europe,</HI> had her Mother been as willing as &s;he, where|as &s;he had rather have been reading of &s;ome brisk Romance, or Story of the &s;trange Metamorpho&s;is of a Maid into a Woman. Be&s;ides her Mother began now to oppo&s;e <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s Vi&s;its, the only comfort her Daughter had, for &s;he being a pretty while in her Teens, had the &s;ame de&s;ire as all her Contemporaries had, to mind nothing but the end for which they were made, which caus'd her, encourag'd by her Mothers rigour, to think on &s;ome way to obtain her de&s;ires, and free her &s;elf from the old Lady's Tyran|ny, which was very much encreas'd &s;ince the death of her Husband, to who&s;e Education he left his Girl <HI>Myrtilla.</HI></P>
<P>Long you may imagine &s;he had not &s;tudied before &s;he found out a Plot (for Women's Wits on &s;uch

This &s;he re&s;olv'd to put in practice, and contrary to a Woman, kept con&s;tant too. But &s;he &s;aw no way of effecting it without making &s;ome body privy to it, and then &s;he thought no one fitter then her Maid <HI>Circe,</HI> a loving Girle, and welwi&s;her to Gen|tlemen, for before &s;he happen'd into her Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Service, &s;he waited on a Lady, and like the re&s;t of that trade, very often cho&s;e before her Mi&s;tre&s;s, other|wi&s;e &s;he would not &s;peak a good word for a Gallant. <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> Mother being call'd to a Womans Labour, &s;he thought it a very fit time to communicate her De|&s;ign to her Maid. Where upon coming down to look for <HI>Circe</HI> &s;he found her in the Garden tumbling on a Camomile bed, lying on her back a Star-gazing, but &s;eeing her young Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;tarting up &s;he quickly quitted that po&s;ture, and ask'd her if &s;he had any &s;ervice to command her. Ah <HI>Circe</HI> (&s;aid &s;he &s;ighing) I have, could I but be a&s;&s;ur'd of thy Secrecy. Of mine, Madam? (reply'd <HI>Circe</HI>) why, there be a great many Gallants in Town, would be Surety for me if need requir'd. Why, 'tis the only thing I am good for. Why then (&s;aid <HI>Myrtilla</HI> &s;itting down with her Maid) you mu&s;t needs have ob&s;erv'd how my Mother pryes into all my Actions, debarring me of all I take delight in. I have now thought how to mend this,

To which <HI>Circe</HI> an&s;wered, I believe he is an hone&s;t Gen|tleman, and were it to me I &s;hould take his word; now all the difficulty will be to make him acquainted with the De&s;ign.

I am certain he will gladly em|brace the opportunity, which I would never have given him, but that I'm confident his Honour will not let him &s;tain mine. Mad <HI>Circe</HI> would have taken up her Mi&s;tre&s;s, but the &s;hort time &s;he had, fearing her Mother's return, would not let <HI>Myrtila</HI> admit of her fooling. Take here &s;aid &s;he, this Jewel (in which was neatly wrought in Diamonds) the Story of the Rape of <HI>Pro&s;erpine</HI> by <HI>Pluto,</HI> (and you cannot imagine <HI>Hyleus</HI> &s;o much a fool as not at fir&s;t &s;ight to under|&s;tand the Hieroglyphick) which I have got wrought on purpo&s;e.

<P>This unexpected News was extreamly &s;urpri&s;ing to <HI>Hyleus,</HI> who before was much fretted with the &s;port he but ju&s;t now came from, for his ill &s;uc|ce&s;s in it. And is it &s;o then, ye kind Deities (cry'd

<P>With this An&s;wer departed <HI>Circe,</HI> who was got home before &s;he was aware, who was extreamly ta|keth with <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and thinking on the Token &s;he had for <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> whom &s;he now began to envy, and long as much for the forbidden fruit as her Mi&s;tre&s;s; coming to <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> &s;he told her the good &s;ucce&s;s of her Me&s;&s;age, and how effectually it had wrought upon the Heart of <HI>Hyleus,</HI> who would not fail two hours after Sun-&s;et; this done &s;he enter'd on the not unplea&s;ant Panegyrick of the expected Gentleman. The ill connection of it, as all other Chambermaids di&s;cour&s;es, makes me I can't remember it, only this I am &s;ure was in it, that he was a fine proper Man, hand&s;om Leg'd, and &s;he'd warrant as good a Woman's Man as any in the Shire. But the old Lady coming home made her unwillingly break off her Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> by this time had got all things in readine&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="12">for his Love-adventure, and &s;etting out with two Servants he had towards the City, which was about three miles from his Hou&s;e, his great de&s;ire of the Prey made him there &s;omething of the &s;oone&s;t, which he had not been, but that <HI>Myrtilla</HI> and <HI>Circe</HI> were at difference; for her Mi&s;tre&s;s could not per&s;wade her to &s;tay behind, if &s;he went, although &s;he urg'd the unlikeline&s;s of their E&s;cape together, however &s;he would not be contented till &s;he had promis'd to &s;end one of <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s Servants for her.</P>
<P>Now we are forc'd to a &s;mall digre&s;&s;ion, to make you acquainted that the Countrey and all it's Sports, with all the per&s;wa&s;ions of his Friend <HI>Paneutus,</HI> could not make <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> leave off thinking on his Mi|&s;tre&s;s, and it &s;o happen'd that his Friend being en|gag'd in &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, our melancholy Lover being left to him&s;elf, who was now taking a turn in the Garden, began to recollect his former Affection, one while chiding him&s;elf for &s;pending &s;o long a time in a vain pur&s;uit; another while angry with him&s;elf for leaving off now, when he was &s;o far engag'd, and then a few mu&s;ty Apothegms got in his Head, <HI>viz.</HI> Maids &s;ay No, and take it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he re&s;olves to renew the On&s;et, for which he could not have met with a convenienter time, <HI>Paneutus</HI> being out of the way, for had he been at home, he could not have been brought to have parted with <HI>Chere&s;tratus,</HI> who&s;e company he took very much delight in: This being re&s;olv'd on, he marched to the Stable, and charges the Groom immediately to make ready his Gelding, under pretence of breathing him that Evening,
<PB N="14" REF="13">and indeed &s;o he did, for in half an hour and two minutes, he reach'd the door of his dearly belov'd <HI>Myrtilla.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> you mu&s;t know, thinking he had been too &s;oon, had taken a turn down to view the Ca&s;tle, thinking immediately to come back, and indeed it was not long e're he did, but however this is the critical minute, when out came <HI>Myrtilla</HI> in a riding Dre&s;s, making &s;igns of di&s;patch to <HI>Chere&s;tratus,</HI> who was &s;taring on the Windows as he us'd to do, not dreaming what good luck was approaching him; Make ha&s;t, make ha&s;t my Dear (cryes the kind Lady) my Mother el&s;e will be here immediately. Our Gallant could &s;carce believe his Eyes or Ears, and thought certainly he was a dreaming, for he could never hope for &s;uch a happine&s;s as to have his cruel Lady &s;ubmit her &s;elf to him; but he now began to &s;mell out the Plot, and without more adoe helpt the Lady up, who had not as yet di&s;cern'd the mi|&s;take. Having got his rich Prize behind him, he thought it not &s;afe to tarry there long, wherefore &s;purring on his free Bea&s;t, away he rides, and met with no ob&s;tacle, for the City gates were kept open for <HI>Hyleus,</HI> by the appointment of the Servants, who had brib'd the Watch-men (for you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf in <HI>Comus</HI>'s City, they keep very good Hours, although the Citizens are commonly &s;can|daliz'd for Revelling, or letting their Wives tarry up longer then them&s;elves.)</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> was now return'd back to <HI>Myrtilla's</HI> Door, to which he was no &s;ooner come, but he heard all
<PB N="15" REF="13">the Hou&s;e in an uproar; for it &s;eems the old Lady had mi&s;t her Daughter, and began to ghe&s;s at the Bu&s;ine&s;s, for which &s;he was &s;chooling <HI>Circe</HI> mo&s;t bit|terly, who being in her riding Clothes, expecting <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s man, could not po&s;&s;ibly frame any thing like an Excu&s;e, at which her Mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;o enrag'd, &s;he began to &s;eek for &s;omething to cha&s;tice the poor Maid. <HI>Circe</HI> therefore &s;eeing her &s;carce avoidable Doom, runs out pulling the door after her, which hinder'd her Executioners pur&s;uit. <HI>Hyleus</HI> who had been all this while in an Agony for his Lady, to think what would become of her, &s;eeing <HI>Circe</HI> e&s;caping out &s;o boldly, and taking her for <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> lights &s;trait off his Hor&s;e to help her up, which done, away he rides. He was no &s;ooner got through the City Gate, but his Servants that accompany'd him thither, came out to congratulate his good fortune, he was &s;o over|joy'd with his Booty, he could &s;carce find time to thank them, making homewards with all the &s;peed imaginable. Whither he was &s;carce come, when by his order three Maids met them &s;trowing Flowers all the way home, while others there were bu&s;ied in providing the Cake and Sack-Po&s;&s;et; at the Gate &s;tood a proper Gentleman U&s;her to take down the Lady, Madam Chamber-maid; that done, off leaps <HI>Hyleus</HI> to &s;alute her, and bid her welcome to her Own.</P>
<P>And now at la&s;t it was that the mi&s;erable man perceiv'd his Errour, but he was wonderfully &s;ur|priz'd to &s;ee <HI>Circe,</HI> where he expected <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> he began now to con&s;ider how improbable it was, that
<PB N="16" REF="14">&s;he &s;hould give her &s;elf up to him &s;o ea&s;ily, and now concludes it was a Plot of <HI>Circe's,</HI> to whom he ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be clear'd of the doubt. And is it thus, ba&s;e Slut, thou ha&s;t abus'd me, and thy Mi&s;tre&s;s? was it for your embraces I have taken all this pains and care? were the numerous Pages about Town, that us'd to accompany their Ma&s;ters to vi&s;it my dear <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> grown &s;o &s;carce, that I mu&s;t be made a Pro|perty? I wonder thy impudence could ever harbour &s;uch a thought, &s;o prejudicious to thy Lady, as to think I was re&s;erv'd for thy tooth; how cam'&s;t thou by this Jewel, which I am confident belong'd once to <HI>Myrtilla?</HI> For none &s;ure would buy thy favour at the va&s;t expence of &s;o rich a Diamond? He would have gone on in his tedious Harangue, but being al|ways kind hearted to Females, he began to con&s;ider how unmanly it was to quarrel with a Woman, and for a fault Love had made her commit. However, his pa&s;&s;ion proceeded &s;o far that he call'd her Whore: Poor <HI>Circe</HI> who all this while &s;tood &s;hivering for fear (though it &s;eem'd to her a plea&s;ant pain, being in the company of her &s;weet <HI>Hyleus</HI>) was &s;omething mov'd at the la&s;t word, which made a deeper im|pre&s;&s;ion on her mind, then all had pa&s;t before (for though I will not &s;wear for her, yet I think &s;he was hone&s;t) &s;he makes him this An&s;wer. My kindne&s;s in helping young Gentlemen in Addre&s;&s;es to my Lady, could never de&s;erve that name. No, no, Sir, you have here no Whore, nor one that had any de&s;igns upon you, but what were innocent and devoted to the Service of my young Mi&s;tre&s;s. I will not indeed &s;o far
<PB N="17" REF="14">bely my Con&s;cience, as to deny I lov'd you; but I was &s;o far from promoting my love, that I quite de&s;pair'd of it; and therefore re&s;olv'd to be happy in the next degree, namely, in mediating with you for my Mi|&s;tre&s;s. The de&s;ire of following her hath thus be|tray'd me to your cen&s;ure. And is <HI>Myrtilla</HI> gone before, then? &s;aid <HI>Hyleus;</HI> Yes Sir, an&s;wered <HI>Circe,</HI> &s;he is, and had not your Pa&s;&s;ion tran&s;ported you, you might e're this have been in a Capacity of reco|vering my Lady, who cannot be gone far.</P>
<P><HI>Circe's</HI> An&s;wer you'l &s;ay was very excu&s;able, and indeed <HI>Hyleus</HI> could not but approve of it, although anger for his ravi&s;h'd Mi&s;tre&s;s would not let him at pre&s;ent acknowledge it. For he immediately com|manded his Hor&s;es to be brought out of the Stable again, but hold, I think they were not yet put in, and with his other Fellow Travellers like a Knight Errant, re&s;olves to go to re&s;cue the Lady, leaving poor <HI>Circe</HI> again to the mercy of the Butler, who was now re&s;olv'd to try the utmo&s;t &s;trength of his &s;trong Beer Philter on the weak Virgin. But &s;he, contrary to his expectation, &s;eem'd more coy, as having more hopes then ever of marrying <HI>Hyleus,</HI> in ca&s;e her Mi&s;tre&s;s could not be found out. But we mu&s;t be found as uncivil as <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and leave her to the But|lers managing, and mad he to his Progre&s;s, and re|turn to <HI>Chere&s;tratus:</HI></P>
<P>Who by this being ten miles out of Town, was impatient to &s;ee and &s;alute his &s;weet Prey, who&s;e Maiden-mode&s;ty not &s;uffering her to &s;peak fir&s;t, very much wonder'd at her &s;ilent Lover. They were
<PB N="18" REF="15">&s;carce gone a quarter of a mile further; but the tran&s;parent Rays of the bright Queen of Night (a rare expre&s;&s;ion for Moon &s;hine this &s;ame) made di&s;covery of a delicate plea&s;ant Meadow, which lay ju&s;t by the Road-&s;ide. <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> could not for his life pa&s;s by this opportunity, he light and gently taking <HI>Myrtilla</HI> off the Hor&s;e, began the amorous Prologue with a Ki&s;s. That done, Madam, &s;aid he, how happy have you made the late mi&s;erable <HI>Chere|&s;tratus!</HI> At the name of <HI>Chere&s;tratus, Myrtilla</HI> &s;tarted, and looking upon him &s;eriou&s;ly, knew him to be the per&s;on nam'd. The poor Lady was &s;o extreamly troubled at this unexpected Accident, that &s;he &s;woun|ed away in <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI>'s Arms, and truly me thinks it was ominous, for ever &s;ince that night the Lady was troubled with Qualms. But I fear I &s;hall be cen|&s;ur'd for playing thus with a Gentlewomans mi&s;|fortunes; all I have to excu&s;e it is, that knowing the the fifth Act of the Play and how they came off, it is pardonable to be merry, and laugh before as &s;he did after &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P><HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> you may imagine was in a &s;weet kind of taking to think that he had lo&s;t his Mi&s;tre&s;s before he had her (which was true enough, if you can make it out) be&s;ides a Con&s;table and a grave igno|rant Jury came in his head, for &s;ome might think he had kill'd her, be&s;ides the plaguy fear of being wrote again&s;t, like <HI>Phila&s;ter</HI> for being the death of his pretty Mi&s;s. All this con&s;ider'd, the poor man was extreamly put to his &s;hifts, what to do. And though men &s;ay our wits are be&s;t in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity,
<PB N="19" REF="15">he at pre&s;ent could not think of a better Remedy, then <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s, &s;o that he was forc'd to give her a gentle twinge oth' No&s;e, for Water in that place there was none, nor any thing el&s;e that might conduce to the recovering of a Lady out of that &s;ad condition. <HI>Myrtilla</HI> by this was &s;omething come again to her &s;elf, and gave <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> &s;ome &s;mall hopes of her, to whom in a lamentable tone &s;he &s;aid. By what Magick, Villian, ha&s;t thou depriv'd me of the com|pany of my dear <HI>Hyleus?</HI> who were he but pre&s;ent, would teach you better manners, then to lie Eves|dropping thus, to betray the &s;ecrets of mi&s;erable Lovers. But alas, why blame I you? It was my own ra&s;hne&s;s, for which I am ju&s;tly puni&s;h'd, &s;ince I could not di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the Worthy <HI>Hyleus</HI> and the ba&s;e <HI>Chere&s;tratus.</HI> Our Gallant, that thought him&s;elf well enough to pa&s;s, as never having a Rupture, or any thing el&s;e that might reduce him to the u&s;ing the Wedding Ring the wrong way, in ca&s;e Art had conquer'd Nature, could not endure to hear <HI>Myrtilla</HI> preferr <HI>Hyleus</HI> &s;o much before him, and was going to vindicate him&s;elf when thus &s;he continued. O my unhappy Fate! have I for this prov'd di&s;obedient, and left my old Mother? to fall into the hands of him I &s;o much hated, who is in pretence only a Lover? if it be not &s;o as I &s;ay, prove your Affection, and re|deem your fault by killing the mi&s;erable <HI>Myrtilla.</HI> Faintly he thought &s;he &s;poke, for all the while&mdash; &s;tay, I think there was no &s;mile in the ca&s;e; however <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> who came <HI>communi Animantium appetitu,</HI> did not care to &s;atisfie his Lady in that point, and had
<PB N="20" REF="16">rather get the King a Souldier, then lo&s;e him a Sub|ject, for Ladies do good Service. No, Madam, &s;aid he, that were to injure you, and rob my &s;elf of the greate&s;t happine&s;s in the world. Your misfortunes are not &s;uch, as to make you boldly wi&s;h for Death, that Bug-Bear to all Ladies. 'Tis time enough for it yet, you have no rea&s;on to think on't, being in the hands of a Per&s;on, of who&s;e incivility you never yet had any proof. I cannot imagine you are really angry, when if you are pleas'd to remember I took you up in a ready Dre&s;s for the March, as if you as well as Heaven were willing to make me happy. For doubtle&s;s, Madam, it was not by meer chance, I left my Friend in the Countrey at &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable time of Night to come and vi&s;it your door, where unlookt for, my good Genious had prepar'd me a &s;ight of my divine <HI>Myrtilla.</HI> No, no, the Powers above, who&s;e will we ought not to re&s;i&s;t, ordain'd this, to &s;ee how happy they could make a mortal Man by the pre|&s;ence of a per&s;on &s;o nigh their Divinities, as your in|comparable &s;elf. This done, he put his Handkerchief to his Eyes, and us'd &s;uch comforting expre&s;&s;ions to the Lady, that they di&s;&s;ipated her clouds of Sorrows. Her Eyes &s;hot &s;uch lu&s;tre, that the Moon with all the noi&s;e of Bra&s;s Pots and Kettles that could be rung out fear'd an Eclip&s;e. To be &s;hort, &s;he &s;eem'd &s;o well &s;atisfy'd, that <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> tying his Hor&s;e to a Tree, did not much offend her, in de&s;iring her to repo&s;e her &s;elf on a neighbouring Bank.

<PB N="21" REF="16">in who&s;e commendations he in&s;i&s;ted &s;o far, that &s;oon after he forc'd her to yield to &s;ome Arguments he brought.

<P>They had not been in this delightful Scene long, but <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> found his Lady's mind to &s;ympathize with the plea&s;antne&s;s of the place, which &s;o reviv'd on a &s;udden her drooping Spirits, that &s;he &s;eem'd &s;o brisk, airy and gay, as gave our Gallant good hopes that the thoughts of <HI>Hyleus</HI> were remov'd, and that &s;he had no &s;mall Affection for him, who was now mu|&s;ing how to compa&s;s the great de&s;ign, for the obtain|ing which he thought nothing more efficacious, then the di&s;paragement of <HI>Hyleus,</HI> his Rival.

<P>The&s;e words &s;o wrought upon her, that &s;he became more obliging than before, &s;o that &s;he very com|plai&s;antly render'd thanks to her Lover for his true Affection, and vow'd &s;he would never have an

No, Madam, (reply'd <HI>Chere|&s;tratus</HI>) if I have de&s;erv'd any thing of you, you may &s;oon think of a better way of rewarding your Lover; who for all tho&s;e favours he &s;aw you daily heap on the unworthy <HI>Hyleus,</HI> could not dimini&s;h his Affections to you, which mu&s;t now be rewarded, or he will &s;acrifice his mi&s;erable life before you.

I expected now &s;he &s;hould have rattled him &s;oundly, but it &s;eems &s;he was not &s;o angry as I took her for: They continued their Di&s;cour&s;e for &s;ome time, which though I could not hear; I &s;oon per|ceiv'd it was no Trea&s;on they &s;poke; for &s;oon after I &s;aw <HI>Myrtilla</HI> with &s;mall reluctancy receive a Green Gown from her lu&s;ty Lover, who was now prepa|ring to make his Lady amends to the utmo&s;t of his power for her former Favours. We will leave 'em in mutual Embraces, and in&s;tead of an <HI>Epithalamium</HI> (for I am loth to be idle) make an Apology for their not &s;taying the Par&s;on's lei&s;ure. To which the&s;e grave Rea&s;ons induce them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Here the Bride-groom is &s;ure next morning to have all his Ribbons upon his Breeches.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Bride, or the Woman lay with, will not be at a lo&s;s to find her Stockings, which at Ceremonious Weddings are thrown over her Head, nor will her Pins be lo&s;t to dre&s;s her with.</P>
<P>Thirdly, While they lie on the Gra&s;s, they need not fear cutting the Bed-cords, or &s;owing the Sheets together.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There can be no Bell under their Bed, unle&s;s a natural Blew-Bell.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="18">
<P>Fifthly, The Lady need not be put to the blu&s;h the next morning by a company of her Chronies with asking her how &s;he does, and how &s;he likes it.</P>
<P>Sixthly and la&s;tly, No trouble&s;ome crowd of Fidlers betimes in the morning, to &s;poil better &s;port with their mi&s;erable &s;craping. For the&s;e and &s;ome other Rea&s;ons, our Lovers may de&s;erve your pardon, which I que&s;tion not but you will give them without peti|tioning for.</P>
<P><HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> now began to fail in his vigour, and was &s;ounding a Retreat in a whole Volly of Ki&s;&s;es, which &s;he return'd very willingly, as being now con|&s;cious of the Obligation &s;he had to him. And then they &s;etled them&s;elves for a gentle Repo&s;e, which they did in &s;o &s;weet a po&s;ture, &s;he infolding his Neck in her delicate Arms, that they &s;eem'd like <HI>Cynthia</HI> and her belov'd <HI>Endymion,</HI> who&s;e &s;oft Embraces &s;he &s;o oft courted. They had not lain long thus, but a &s;weet Sleep &s;eiz'd them both, in which they dream'd over again what they had ju&s;t now been the real partakers of. Where we will leave them to their natural Re&s;t, and return to <HI>Hyleus</HI> and his three Companions, who ju&s;t now unfortunately arriv'd at this Scene of Love, whither they were no &s;ooner arriv'd, but <HI>Hyleus</HI> &s;py'd out the Pair of Lovers in that loving Condition, that I de&s;crib'd them in.</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI> was enrag'd to &s;ee his <HI>Myrtilla</HI> as it were with her own Con&s;ent given up to another. He immediately draws his Rapier, and &s;wears mo&s;t damnably that he will be the death of <HI>Chere&s;tratus,</HI> as in effect he had, but that tho&s;e who accompany'd
<PB N="26" REF="19">him, having a kindne&s;s for his happy Rival, per|&s;waded him to de&s;i&s;t from his purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t they told him he ought to &s;tay till he wak'd, for then he might force him nobly either to re&s;ign up his Life, or his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ing he had forc'd her again&s;t her Will (as the loving po&s;ture they were in, was proof enough to the contrary) for otherwi&s;e, it was not worth the while. Well, with much adoe, <HI>Hyleus</HI> was at la&s;t per&s;waded to &s;tay till he wak'd, but then he &s;wore to be reveng'd on him.</P>
<P>Hereupon for this purpo&s;e lighting off their Hor|&s;es, they all &s;at down by our &s;leeping Lovers; It had been you'l &s;ay, a great temptation to his fellow Travellers to lie by &s;o hand&s;ome a Lady, but be|ing weary with accompanying their Ma&s;ter in his wilde pur&s;uit, they thus &s;eem'd with him rather to have a de&s;ire to &s;leep, than any thing el&s;e; they &s;trove indeed a great while again&s;t the drow&s;ie Di&s;temper, but <HI>Morpheus</HI> at la&s;t arre&s;ted them, in the King's name, and charg'd them to keep the Peace, which they had broken with their loud Jangling.</P>
<P>They had not been long under the Leaden Scep|ter'd Gentieman's hands, but the two Lovers a|wak'd very much troubled to &s;ee any Company there, but much more when they knew them to be <HI>Hyleus</HI> and his men. <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> bid his <HI>Myrtilla</HI> not be affraid, but prepare for her Journey, by which he doubted not, but they &s;hould e&s;cape the Enemy, which <HI>Myrtilla</HI> as much now endeavour'd to avoid,
<PB N="27" REF="19">as not long before &s;he coveted the Sight of <HI>Hyleus. Chere&s;tratus</HI> that had before learn'd of <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> that <HI>Hyleus</HI> had receiv'd a rich Diamond of her, which was to be worn in his Hat, was unwilling to leave that Token of his Ladies former Affection behind him, wherefore he advanc'd towards <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and did without any difficulty find out the Jewel by the ex|tream lu&s;tre of it. Having got this, he and <HI>Myrtilla</HI> march with full &s;peed together towards his Friend's Hou&s;e, with whom he had lodg'd being invited, the hone&s;t tru&s;ty Soul <HI>Paneutus.</HI></P>
<P>They had not been long gone, but <HI>Hyleus</HI> and his men awake, and find the Pair of Lovers gone, to the &s;atisfaction of all but <HI>Hyleus,</HI> who was &s;o much troubled at their e&s;cape, that they had much adoe to keep him from laying violent hands on him&s;elf, but his rage was very much encreas'd when he &s;aw the Jewel was gone too, and now he re&s;olves to pur&s;ue <HI>Chere&s;tratus,</HI> not as a Rival only, but as a profe&s;t Enemy. The Servants did all they could to pacifie their furious Ma&s;ter, telling him he ought not to be &s;o incens'd again&s;t <HI>Chere&s;tratus,</HI> &s;ince he had done nothing but what a Lover in the like ca&s;e would have done, and that doubtle&s;s it was not his fault, but <HI>Myrtilla</HI> either by her free con&s;ent, or the treachery of <HI>Circe,</HI> that lov'd him her &s;elf, had deliver'd her up to him. And that &s;ince 'twas &s;o, he ought not to de&s;pi&s;e the innocent flames of pretty <HI>Circe,</HI> who excepting her Birth, &s;eem'd altogether as worthy his Bed, as the &s;cornful, faithle&s;s <HI>Myr|tilla.</HI> What though &s;he &s;ent that Diamond, yet
<PB N="28" REF="20"><HI>Circe</HI> brought it, by whom he might reckon it given too, &s;eeing there was no Remedy left, and there appear'd not the lea&s;t hopes of overtaking the happy couple.</P>
<P><HI>Hyleus</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ion was now pretty well over, when he took Hor&s;e for Home, intending to follow his Servants Coun&s;el, and make poor <HI>Circe</HI> happy, who all this while was crying, and deploring her condi|tion. As &s;oon as he came in, he call'd for her, and with a Ki&s;s told her, his Intention was to marry her that Night, telling her the mad Adventures of his ra&s;h Journey. <HI>Circe</HI> you may ea&s;ily imagine, was very well pleas'd to hear her Mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;ped &s;o well, and that &s;he was now to enjoy her belov'd <HI>Hyleus. Hyleus</HI> immediately &s;ent for the man in Black, and gave order for making ready that very Night for the Wedding, which was done with all &s;peed, and they two huddled to Bed together, for better for wor&s;e, where I &s;uppo&s;e they had as much &s;atisfaction of one another, as <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> and <HI>Myr|tilla</HI> did before, be&s;ides the advantage they had of a &s;ofter Bed.</P>
<P>The next day early, <HI>Hyleus</HI> &s;ent to be&s;peak the Wedding Dinner five miles off, where al&s;o <HI>Chere|&s;tratus</HI> with his Lady were that day to be merry together; and as good luck would have it, they were in the next Room to one another, though neither Company knew of it, till about Dinner time. <HI>Myrtilla</HI> hearing <HI>Hyleus</HI>'s Voice in the next Room, &s;wouned, <HI>Chere&s;tratus</HI> and all his Company
<PB N="29" REF="20">wonder'd at the &s;uddene&s;s of her &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;u|&s;pected there was &s;omething in it more then ordi|nary; and as &s;oon as &s;he came to her &s;elf again, &s;he told them the Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;he heard <HI>Hyleus,</HI> and fear'd le&s;t he &s;hould know of <HI>Chere|&s;tratus,</HI> and there might &s;ome mi&s;chief be done. They cheer'd her up, and told her there was no fear of any &s;uch thing, e&s;pecially in that place. While they were comforting <HI>Myrtilla,</HI> a Gentle|man that was equally a Friend to both of them, ran to tell <HI>Hyleus,</HI> having fir&s;t engag'd him to be civil, &s;ince things could not be alter'd. <HI>Hyleus</HI> was at fir&s;t &s;urprized, but then one glance of <HI>Circe's</HI> di&s;pell'd his anger, and he was re&s;olv'd to joyn Companies, which he pre&s;ently did, to the &s;atis|faction of both Parties. Where I'le leave them drinking their Ladies Healths, be&s;ides &s;ome odd Bru&s;hers to the little Country Gentleman, or <HI>Myr|tilla's Hans en Kelder.</HI></P>
