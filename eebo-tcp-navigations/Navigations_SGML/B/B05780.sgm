<P>SCarce had they given over <HI>talking</HI> at Court of the taking of <HI>Mons,</HI> and of the advantages that <HI>France</HI> would re|ceive by &s;o important a Conque&s;t, which put into her Hands the Key of all the Spani&s;h <HI>Netherlands,</HI> but a whi&s;pering be|gan to be &s;pread abroad, that the Council had &s;ome new de&s;ign in Hand, which promi|&s;ed great things and would be the occa&s;ion of as great an umbrage, yea greater than that of <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> Whil&s;t the Generals were ga|thering together, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Luxem|bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gh, de Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, d' Humieres, Boufflers, Vauban</HI> and others of the &s;ecret Council were pa&s;|&s;ing to and fro; it was not doubted but there was &s;ome grand Enterprize on foot. The Criticks of the times, and tho&s;e which made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to fore&s;ee things to come, met al&s;o by cour&s;es, and did indi&s;creetly ca&s;t the Horo&s;cope of the place threatned with this Thunderbolt, upon which it was ready to fall; making the Innocent bear the burthen of the Guilty, but withall not di&s;covering any thing of their real intentions; for <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5"> is &s;o &s;ubtle in concealing her de&s;igns, that &s;he would oblige People to believe quite ano|ther thing than what &s;he really intends. Neverthele&s;s orders were given that all things &s;hould be in readine&s;s. The Roads were al|ready fill'd with Waggons and Carts loaden with Ammunition and Provi&s;ion, which went to fill the Magazines of <HI>Mons, Phillip-Ville, Maubeuge,</HI> and <HI>Dinant.</HI> There were never &s;een &s;o many Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es, gathered together, and &s;ent in a time when the rigour of the Winter had rendred the Roads unpa&s;&s;able. They were not &s;atisfied with the great Stores of Corn and Forrage, that all the conquer'd Countries could furni&s;h them withall, be&s;ides an innumerable number of Provi&s;ions, rais'd in the Enemies Country by way of Contributions, but al&s;o the Hay and Oats of <HI>Champaign</HI> and the Neighbouring Provinces, had been tran&s;ported in &s;o great abundance, that it reduc'd the People of that Country to the la&s;t extremity; having de|prived them of their proper &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. Be|&s;ides all the&s;e Prodigious Preparations, to prevent yet the di&s;order which might hap|pen to a great and numerous Army, if it &s;hould once come to want Provi&s;ions, they made u&s;e of the &s;ame Artifice as they had done at the Siege of <HI>Mons,</HI> I mean, that the Victu|aller General found a way how to bring from
<PB N="3" REF="5"> <HI>Holland</HI> 100000 Crowns worth of Dutch Chee&s;e, by the intelligence he had with a Baker at <HI>Gaunt</HI> who knew the &s;ecret how to get it convey'd: In the affair of <HI>Mons,</HI> &s;o great a provi&s;ion was made, that after the reduction of that place, the Army being fir&s;t furni&s;h't, the re&s;t was publickly &s;old, for fear it &s;hould be &s;poil'd; &s;o that nothing was &s;een in the Boats and publick Markets but <HI>Holland</HI> Chee&s;e.</P>
<P>So that we may &s;ay that <HI>France</HI> partly maintains her Armies, upon the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of her Enemies; and the opportunity &s;he hath by the means of her Gold and Silver, to &s;pread Corruption in a Country as fruitful of Tray|tors as <HI>Brabant,</HI> emboldens her, and makes her undertake in the mid&s;t of Winter, the Siege of the &s;tronge&s;t places in <HI>Europe,</HI> whil&s;t the Allies, who do not u&s;e &s;o much precau|tion, &s;ee them&s;elves incapacitated for want of <HI>Magazines,</HI> to enter the Campaign before the Month of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>But it is not of Ye&s;terday that <HI>France</HI> has been a practitioner in this mattter. In the War of 1672. &s;he managed otherwi&s;e, for then Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> found the way, &s;ome Months before the Declaration of the War, to draw from the Principal Bankers of the City of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in ready Mony full eight Millions of Silver.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
<P>This Summ and many others privately rai&s;ed in &s;everal other Cities of the&s;e Pro|vinces were advanced, and defray'd a part of the charge of the War, which had like to have overturn'd the State, and to put it upon the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>But without calling in the time pa&s;t for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or diving into things acted in the precedent Wars and Ran&s;acking, as we &s;ay, the A&s;hes of the Dead, let us di&s;|cour&s;e of the Living, and bring upon the Stage the Illu&s;trious Marque&s;s of <HI>Ga&s;tenaga,</HI> heretofore Governour of the low Coun|tries.</P>
<P>What has he not done to fill his Coffers?</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Cavalry has lo&s;t in him one of the be&s;t Jockeys in all the Countries of <HI>Germany, Liege,</HI> or <HI>Brabant;</HI> and I do not know how they will do after the Campaign, and who &s;hall furni&s;h them &s;ufficiently with Hor&s;es to remount their Cavalry. For we reckon that he has conveyed into <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince the Declaration of the War, to the num|ber of 40000 Hor&s;e, for which he had three Pi&s;toles <HI>per</HI> Hor&s;e for his pains.</P>
<P>But now when we unmask the cau&s;e of &s;o many Misfortunes, mu&s;t we not avow, whe|ther we will or no, that we know the evil and are not willing to remedy it? &s;ince we &s;ee that no exact inquiry has been made into
<PB N="5" REF="6"> all the&s;e rotten Members, who betray'd the good Party, and &s;old (by the example of <HI>Judas I&s;cariot</HI>) their Country, their Wives, and Children; and all that was mo&s;t Sacred and Inviolable in the Government.</P>
<P>But to return to my matter in Hand: Af|ter having &s;o furni&s;hed the <HI>Magazines,</HI> as we have already &s;aid, Orders were di&s;patched, which were carried in all ha&s;t by Curriers &s;ent into <HI>Savoy, Germany</HI> and <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to cau&s;e all the Troops to be upon their March, in order to be in <HI>Flanders</HI> at the be|ginning of the Month of <HI>April.</HI> To cover yet better the great De&s;ign, and to deceive the Enemies by Marches &amp; Countermarches which were caus'd to be made, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boufflers</HI> had orders to go to <HI>Mons</HI> to command in the ab&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Luxenburgh,</HI> who &s;taid at <HI>Paris</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the la&s;t Re&s;olutions of the great Council of War, which was to be held before the opening of the Campaign, where &s;everal ob&s;tacles and difficulties that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Vauban</HI> and <HI>de Megrini</HI> had propo&s;ed in the Execution of this project were to be de|cided. Now it is acknowledged by all, that the&s;e two Ingineers are beyond all contro|ver&s;y not only the be&s;t of this Age, but al|&s;o that <HI>France</HI> ever had, &s;ince &s;he was go|vern'd by Kings, and that we may call them without <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> the Right Hand of the
<PB N="6" REF="7"> Conque&s;ts that the King has made during the whole cour&s;e of his Reign, and greate&s;t pro&s;perities, if we con&s;ider the Invention, the good Order, the Capacity, and the quick Execution; in which we may &s;ay that they have not their fellows in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But let us &s;ay al&s;o without <HI>Hyperbole</HI> or Flat|tery, that it is a great advantage for an In|genious Man, when he has to do with a Prince who &s;pares nothing for the Execution of a de&s;ign; and this doth not a little contribute to acquire him a great Reputation in the World; whereas others that are in the Ser|vice of other Princes find them&s;elves with all their Ingenuity, bauk'd and &s;topt, &s;ome|times in the mid&s;t of their Carreer, when they are upon a great de&s;ign, by the defect and want of means which &s;hould contribute the mo&s;t to make them &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>But however it be, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Vauban</HI> and <HI>de Megrini</HI> had orders to be at <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the fini&s;hing of this de&s;ign. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Megrini</HI> who made his ordinary abode at <HI>Tournay,</HI> of which he was Governour, depart|ed in all ha&s;te to place him&s;elf, where his Maje&s;ties orders had call'd him, and arriv'd, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Catinat</HI> did, who had taken Po&s;t immediately after the taking of <HI>Montmellian.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<P>All was now ready for the opening of the Council, and all the Generals his Maje&s;ty had pleas'd to call, were arriv'd.</P>
<P>The number yet was but very &s;mall, the King being in what regards his Council and his Secrets, a Prince as circum&s;pect as ever was; which is the cau&s;e that his Ma|je&s;ty confides in &s;o few per&s;ons, and that he ordinarily admits none but &s;uch as are ex|tremely re&s;erv'd; &s;o we we may &s;ay it is one of the principal Wheels upon which his great de&s;igns, and his good fortune moves; and that he is come to &s;o many Conque&s;ts on|ly by this means; and if we &s;ay of Mony that it is the Sinew of War, we may &s;ay al&s;o that Silence is the Soul, and that by con&s;e|quence they are both indi&s;pen&s;ably and ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince they make Armies move and march where they think fit, mak|ing them Victorious and Ma&s;ters of the mo&s;t Important Forts, of Provinces, and al&s;o of whole Kingdoms, as we have experienc'd in the la&s;t Revolution that happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> which we may &s;ay was the only time that the French King was deceiv'd; for that ordina|rily he has &s;o many precautions, and al&s;o &s;o great a number of <HI>Emi&s;&s;aries</HI> well paid in all Courts, that he keeps in his Pocket (&s;o to &s;peak) the Key of their Coun&s;els and mo&s;t &s;ecret Re&s;olutions.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="8">
<P>But we may &s;ay that the affair of <HI>England</HI> was miraculous; for how el&s;e could King <HI>William,</HI> encompa&s;s'd round with French Spies, as he was in &s;uch a place as the <HI>Hague,</HI> (where they were &s;een to walk openly in Troops, and with as much confidence and fiercene&s;s as if they had been in the mid&s;t of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI>) find neverthele&s;s means to hide &s;o great an undertaking, to carry it on a whole year, and to tru&s;t but two Mini&s;ters of State with it, to wit Pen&s;ionary <HI>Fagel</HI> of happy memory, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dickvelt,</HI> to make all the Preparations, and at la&s;t to make them appear by the Reduction of three Kingdoms, and to &s;ave, by an undertaking as bold as &s;ucce&s;sfull, <HI>Europe</HI> from Slavery, and that in the &s;ight of two mighty Kings his Enemies well Arm'd, who &s;tood waiting for him without ever &s;tirring, treated him with fool-hardine&s;s, and flatter'd them&s;elves with hopes, to &s;ee him &s;wallow'd up in his enter|prize, with as much &s;hame and Confu&s;ion as the unfortunate Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was?</P>
<P>Finally, that I may return to my &s;ubject, the great Council of War, which was to be held at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> being a&s;&s;embled, and all the Generals being there pre&s;ent, his Maje&s;ty would according to his cu&s;tom have a particular Conference with each General, and for this rea&s;on order'd they &s;hould enter
<PB N="9" REF="8"> in order, one after another, into his Cham|ber.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> was fir&s;t call'd, as be|ing the greate&s;t Favourite, and him in whom his Maje&s;ty mo&s;t confided, looking upon him as his greate&s;t &s;upport, and him who would maintain at pre&s;ent the Honour of the Nati|on and the Glory of <HI>France.</HI> It will not be alltogether foreign to our purpo&s;e, before we go any farther, to &s;peak a word of the Per&s;on of this General.</P>
<P>We will &s;ay then that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;o much made of and &s;o much e&s;teem'd as now he is, ought not to boa&s;t to be de&s;cended from the Illu&s;trious and ancient Hou&s;e of <HI>Luxem|burgh,</HI> which has given &s;o many Emperors to <HI>Germany,</HI> and &s;o many Kings to <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> neither is he of the po&s;terity of tho&s;e titular Dukes of <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> and <HI>Piney,</HI> Princes of <HI>Tingry;</HI> but a Po&s;thumous Son of <HI>Francis Lord</HI> of <HI>Bouteville,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Montmoranci,</HI> who was beheaded at <HI>Paris</HI> the 21. of <HI>June,</HI> 1627. for having kill'd in cold Blood in a Duel &s;everal per&s;ons of Quality. This happen'd under the Mi|ni&s;try of the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu.</HI> The pre|&s;ent Duke of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> was then but in the Cradle, and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Bouteville</HI> his Mother, retir'd her &s;elf after this di&s;grace to one of her Country Hou&s;es, where &s;he
<PB N="10" REF="9"> liv'd a Melancholy life, till &s;uch time as her only Son, whom &s;he very tenderly belov'd, arriv'd at the &s;eventh year of his age, an age in which it was fit to take him from the Hands of Women, and put him under the care of Governors capable to give him Edu|cation &s;uitable for a Per&s;on of Quality.</P>
<P>By this time Madam <HI>de Bouteville</HI> judg'd that the Mothers Hou&s;e was a place very un|fit for the Education of the young Count, and be&s;ides, being not di&s;&s;atisfied to find an occa&s;ion to &s;hew a part of her Re&s;entment of the &s;hameful Death of her Husband, &s;he re&s;olv'd to carry her Son to Court, and pre&s;ent him to the King.</P>
<P>She &s;et out then for <HI>Paris</HI> without much Equipage, and being arriv'd &s;he went the next day to St. <HI>Germain,</HI> and demanded Au|dience of the King, who was then with the Prince and &s;ome Lords of the Court. They were mightily &s;urpriz'd at the arrival of this Lady, who for many years, had not appear'd in the World, and every one &s;trove to find out the rea&s;on of it, when &s;he enter'd into the Chamber, having her Son in her Hand, whom &s;he carried &s;traight to the King, &s;ay|ing, Sir, here is the la&s;t of the <HI>Montmoranci</HI>'s, which I pre&s;ent to your Maje&s;tty to do with as you think fit.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<P>The King would have reply'd &s;omething to her, but Madam <HI>de Bouteville</HI> not de&s;iring to engage in any further di&s;cour&s;e, retir'd after having perform'd her obei&s;ance and left the young Count in the Kings Chamber.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who was naturally very generous, was &s;o affected at the condi|tion of this poor Gentleman, that he told the King, that he having been formerly a ve|ry good friend of his Fathers, and of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Montmoranci,</HI> he would do him a very great favour to let him bring up this la&s;t ca&s;t|away of a Family which had been dear to him; the King con&s;ented, and the Prince carried him home, caus'd him to be in&s;truct|ed and brought up with all imaginable care, particularly in the exerci&s;es of a Gentleman, &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h as Riding the Great Hor&s;e, and Fencing, and as to that, give me leave to tell you what an old Officer brought up from his infancy in the Lord <HI>Bouteville's</HI> Hou&s;e, did a&s;&s;ure me, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> was born &s;traight, and of a good &s;hape, and that he appear'd &s;o to the Eyes of the World, till he was ten years of age, that the Prince, as we may &s;ay, forcing nature in the Child, did &s;o hara&s;s him in mounting on Hor&s;e back and fencing, before he was &s;trong enough to bear the&s;e rude Exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;es, that he thereby lo&s;t one full Third of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<P>In effect, tho&s;e that have &s;een him undre&s;s'd know that he is in a manner all Thighs and Leggs,</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, this la&s;t opinion is &s;carcely believ'd, if we make Reflection upon his hump back, which gives him &s;o ridiculous an Air, and which cannot be look'd upon other|wi&s;e than a natural defect; and it is rea&s;o|nable to believe he came into the World in this condition, becau&s;e we certainly &s;ee by experience, that the exerci&s;e of Arms contri|butes rather to regulate and render the Body free, than to cau&s;e &s;uch imperfections.</P>
<P>Let it be as it will, he has improv'd it well. We may &s;ay that he is at pre&s;ent a Man after the King's own Heart, &s;o it is not to be wonder'd at if he leaves to him the Government of his Armies, &s;ince he has been bold &s;everal times to &s;ay, <HI>That he thank'd God that he had caus'd him to be born with|out pity and compa&s;&s;ion, to the end he might be more capable of &s;erving the King his Ma&s;ter, and executing his de&s;igns:</HI> A ve|ry Chri&s;tian like &s;entiment and worthy of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Luxemburgh.</HI></P>
<P>But as to the Hump in his Back, it will not be ami&s;s to give an account of a thought which he had the day after the Battle of <HI>Fleurns.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="10">
<P>As he receiv'd the Complements of &s;ucce&s;s from the Lieutenant Generals, and other Officers of his Army, &s;hewing them his Hump, he told them he had there a re&s;erve of a Body of Forty Thou&s;and Men, of which his Enemies knew nothing, which would always render him Victorious, thereby re|marking the Artifices which he made u&s;e of, which without contradiction makes up a good part of the Necromancy, of which he was accu&s;ed, and which he him&s;elf has be|gun to Communicate, &s;ince he has been a Commander, to the other French Generals.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Bouflers,</HI> who was one of his principal Di&s;ciples, did him mo&s;t Honour; for he it is that at pre&s;ent &s;eems to have profited mo&s;t by the Le&s;&s;ons of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>So Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> cho&s;e him to be at the Head of this re&s;erve, of which he &s;poke, and was very careful in all the Battles, to place him &s;o well, that he was &s;een running up and down like a Mad-Man, not to &s;ay fly, upon the lea&s;t &s;ignal that he gave him.</P>
<P>The King &s;eeing him come in, turn'd towards him, and &s;poke in the&s;e Terms, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> you are the Per&s;on at this Day in whom <HI>France</HI> places her greate&s;t hopes; my People look upon
<PB N="14" REF="11"> you as their <HI>Turenne,</HI> and I my &s;elf e&s;teem you as my right Hand; you &s;ee me en|gaged in an unhappy War, which con|&s;umes my Trea&s;ure, impoveri&s;hes my Sub|jects, ruins the State, and makes me apprehen&s;ive of unhappy Events.</P>
<P>It is a lingring Fever, which undermines by little and little my Kingdom, and I fear le&s;t it &s;hould in the i&s;&s;ue become like <HI>Spain,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a poor and impotent De&s;ert.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I thank your Maje&s;ty for having forgot my pa&s;s'd faults, and for honouring me with the preference of the Command of your Armies before the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Humieres,</HI> much Older and Wi&s;er than my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I am at the &s;ame time very much Obliged to the decea&s;ed Marque&s;s of <HI>Louvois</HI> my good Friend, and to the good Madam <HI>de Main|tenon,</HI> who &s;ollicited my relea&s;e, and em|ploy'd all their credit with your Maje&s;ty to get me out of the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> where I had been &s;hut up, upon the Death of the Count <HI>de Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> and &s;everal other &s;mall mat|ters, which I was branded withall: I vow, I did not expect to be received again into your Grace and Favour, your Maje&s;ty ha|ving had &s;ince t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e War of 1672 a particu|lar aver&s;ion to my P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;on.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="12"> of &s;o great a Favour, I will do for my part, all that lies in my power, to ruin your Enemies, and advance your Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>You know, an&s;wer'd his Maje&s;ty, That the fir&s;t Campaign, which was that of 1689. I gave the Command of my Army to the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Humieres,</HI> and that this Gene|ral, who is a good Man, did really do me good &s;ervice.</P>
<P>For it was him that I &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> immediately af|ter the Death of King <HI>Charles,</HI> and he ex|ecuted my Orders very punctually. For King <HI>James,</HI> who came to be Crown'd King of three Kingdoms, received him with open Arms, and very generou&s;ly accepted all the offers of Alliance and Friend&s;hip that <HI>Humieres</HI> made him on my be|half.</P>
<P>But this unfortunate Prince afterwards not having followed my Orders, found him&s;elf all of a &s;udden overwhelm'd with great troubles, and has engag'd me in a War which has Arm'd all <HI>Europe</HI> again&s;t me.</P>
<P>But to come to my purpo&s;e: Having then cho&s;e him to Command in <HI>Flanders</HI> again&s;t Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> a General of good Conduct, and well in&s;tructed in
<PB N="17" REF="12"> what concern'd the Order that an Army in her Marches and Incampments ought to be kept in; but on the other hand ve|ry unlucky to hazard a Battle; I remark'd that in this fir&s;t year, the Mar&s;hal <HI>d' Hu|mieres</HI> &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be Coop'd up, as we &s;ay, by Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> and that he had during the whole Campaign the di&s;|advantage.</P>
<P>I remember al&s;o very well the Battle of <HI>Walcourt,</HI> which was on the Great St. <HI>Louis</HI> day, Patron and Protector of my King|dom, where all my Hou&s;e-hold was Cut in pieces; but I pardon him with all my heart, becau&s;e he did it with a good in|tention, and belief of doing me Service that day. The little Genius of <HI>d' Humi|eres</HI> was not only the cau&s;e of this check; but we may al&s;o &s;ay that he favour'd, by the little motion he made, the Enterpri|zes of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and of the Ele|ctors, who took Three good Cities from me that year.</P>
<P>The decea&s;ed Marque&s;s <HI>de Louvois,</HI> whom I now very much lament, foretold it me; the good Man was a very good Phy&s;iognomi&s;t, and as he knew his People extremely well, &s;o he was ob&s;erved not to be mi&s;taken in the choice he made of Per&s;ons of merit to fill the vacant places, which has been the
<PB N="18" REF="13"> cau&s;e, that during my Reign, I have always had the choice&s;t Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>It was he that pre&s;ented Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ca|tinat</HI> to me, to Command in <HI>Italy,</HI> being a Man, he &s;aid, who had experience, and the good Fortune to have pa&s;s'd through all the inferiour degrees in the War, having been formerly a common Sol|dier.</P>
<P>I was al&s;o willing to imploy the Duke of <HI>Duras</HI> to Command in <HI>Germany;</HI> but <HI>Louvois</HI> advis'd me rather to &s;end the Mar|&s;hal <HI>de Lorge</HI> his Brother, as a Man who had more of Softne&s;s and execution, which agrees better with the natural &s;lowne&s;s of the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>I had al&s;o made choice of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lau|zun</HI> for <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the Sollicitation of Ma|damoi&s;elle <HI>de Monpen&s;ier</HI> my Cou&s;in, but the poor Man is no more what he was, and the affairs of that Kingdom were quite changed after the lo&s;s of the Battle of the <HI>Boyn,</HI> where he commanded joyntly with King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Louvois</HI> advis'd me to call him back as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly, and to &s;end the brave St. <HI>Ruth</HI> of happy memory, whom I much lament, becau&s;e he was the Man that Purg'd my Kingdom of the Huguenot He|re&s;ie.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="13">
<P>He was naturally ha&s;ty, but brave as his Sword.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, I found him very &s;ervicea|ble to me, and if he had not been unfortuna|tely kill'd by a Cannon Bullet, I am per&s;ua|ded that the War would have la&s;ted &s;till in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> would not have come off &s;o cheap in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o the decea&s;ed Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> who pre&s;ented <HI>Tourville</HI> to me to Com|mand my Fleet, as an Admiral of a gallant Per&s;on; And I vow that I have had till this very time a great deal of trouble to &s;top the Torrent of his Courage. He talks to me in all my undertakings of nothing but giv|ing Battle to the Enemy. Hitherto I have always hindred him, becau&s;e I was not altogether &s;atisfied with the Engagement of 1690. where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> alone with 20. or 22. Men of War, dar'd to attack him at the head of my Fleet, which was compo&s;ed of more than 80. great Ships, whil&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> contented them&s;elves to be Spectators; and that which cau&s;ed a&s;toni&s;hment, was, that after a Fight of more than Six hours, not one of the Ene|mies Ships was taken, having retreated after the Fight in very good order, tho' in truth di&s;abled and unma&s;ted. So the la&s;t Expedition, I order'd him to &s;hun all
<PB N="20" REF="14"> Engageing, and when the Enemies &s;hould be on the one &s;ide, to go on the other; which he ob&s;erv'd very well</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o from the &s;ame hand that the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Bouflers</HI> was pre&s;ented to me, tho' in truth Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> al&s;o contributed, for &s;he wearied me Night and Day, and I never &s;aw her but &s;he &s;poke to me of him.</P>
<P>But I have not been deceiv'd in him.</P>
<P>He is one of the brave&s;t Officers that I have at this Day in my Armies, and from whom I reap the greate&s;t benefit, by the Contributions, which he takes care to ga|ther together, and to make my Enemies pay in ready mony, which makes a con&s;i|derable Sum, de&s;ign'd to buy Hor&s;es to re-mount my Cavalry.</P>
<P>For his pains, I have lately made him Captain of my Guards, be&s;ides &s;everal other good Offices which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; fur|ther more I have re&s;erv'd a Mar&s;hals Staff for him, if the War la&s;t two Campaigns more.</P>
<P>'Tis <HI>Louvois</HI> al&s;o who pre&s;ented to me Mon&s;ieur <HI>Amelott</HI> (formerly my Amba&s;&s;a|dor at <HI>Venice</HI>) to go and re&s;ide with the Laudable <HI>Swi&s;s Cantons</HI> during this War.</P>
<P>I have been deceiv'd in him no more than in Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bouflers,</HI> for if this knows
<PB N="21" REF="14"> how to u&s;e a Pi&s;tol, and is able in the handling of a Sword, the other is no le&s;s in that of the Pen. It is al&s;o to his good conduct that I attribute all the good intel|ligence, which reigns at pre&s;ent among&s;t my Cou&s;ins the <HI>Sui&s;&s;ers.</HI></P>
<P>Let him but make a Speech with Words well plac'd, back'd with a good Pur&s;e of my <HI>Loui&s;&s;es,</HI> di&s;tributed under|hand and behind the Curtain, I obtain im|mediately all I would have. They grant|ed me the la&s;t Campaign the rai&s;ing of ten thou&s;and Men of new Troops.</P>
<P>I hope they will grant me this Cam|paign at lea&s;t fifteen thou&s;and to fill up the number of the forty thou&s;and that I have in my &s;ervice, with whom I am very well &s;atisfied, for they are the be&s;t Foot of my Army.</P>
<P>I ought not to forget to &s;peak one word by the way of their General <HI>Stouppa,</HI> with whom I am very well contented, who &s;eems to have chang'd his Country in changing his Religion, that is to &s;ay, be|come a good French-Man. He takes &s;o &s;trongly to Heart my intere&s;ts, that we &s;ee him boldly march at the Head of the <HI>Swi&s;&s;er</HI>'s Troops, every where, and in all places, laughing at certain old and pre|tended Treaties, which &s;ay that the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="15"> that are in my Service, &s;hall not act a|gain&s;t the Emperour and his Allies.

<P><HI>Bidall</HI> writ to me that he could no lon|ger retain his Re&s;entment, and that the Engli&s;h and Dutch Capers might make him become one <HI>of the French Intere&s;t.</HI> I have given order to the Count <HI>de Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hune</HI> to &s;ay at his arrival at <HI>Stockholme,</HI> That he was arriv'd by chance, and that a Tem|pe&s;t had ca&s;t him there, that he may con|ceal &s;o much the better his Negotiation. I hear, thanks to God, that he is happi|ly arriv'd. I have al&s;o in <HI>Holland</HI> one of the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Bethune,</HI> which doth me very good &s;ervice, and who has well &s;uc|ceeded the Count <HI>d' Avaux.</HI></P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Bethune</HI> had con&s;iderable Summs to pay to Madam <HI>Morean's</HI> Father a rich Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI> but finding him|&s;elf disabl'd to &s;erve him, he engag'd him|&s;elf to obtain of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> (by my recommendation) Letters of credit for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Moreau</HI> her Husband, and that by this means he might, as we &s;ay, kill two Birds with one Stone, and be as

<P>When the Count <HI>de Bethune</HI> &s;hall have made the fir&s;t motion to the Northern Princes, I have then the Count <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> and <HI>Bonrepos,</HI> ready to &s;et &s;ail for that Coa&s;t, to go and fini&s;h what <HI>Bethune</HI> &s;hall have begun.</P>
<P>I have made choice of the&s;e two Mi|ni&s;ters <HI>d' Avaux</HI> for <HI>Sweedland,</HI> and <HI>Bon|repos</HI> for <HI>Denmark,</HI> becau&s;e truly I judg them mo&s;t proper to bring tho&s;e two Crowns to a Mediation; their manage|ment accompanied with &s;ome Millions may buy a peace, or at lea&s;t &s;et a good &s;tep towards it. <HI>D' Avaux</HI> has done me great Services in <HI>Holland,</HI> and knows the Republican Spirit to the bottom.

<P>Sir, &s;aid he, here is the mo&s;t active of your Subjects, and from whom your Ma|je&s;ty may receive great Services, if you &s;end him Amba&s;&s;adour to the Northern Crowns; which I did accordingly, and truly he did me very good &s;ervice at the Court of the decea&s;ed Elector of <HI>Brande|burgh.</HI></P>
<P>I knew by his Intreagues all that pa&s;s'd there. The Kings of <HI>Sweedland</HI> and <HI>Den|mark</HI> did nothing but what I came to the knowledg of, by his means; &s;o that I did not trouble my &s;elf to have on that &s;ide any other Spy, nor corre&s;pondence but his. Since calling him home, I &s;ent <HI>Bidal</HI> in his place, and it is he al&s;o actually takes care of my intelligence in tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>But an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I have heard that your Maje&s;ty has &s;ent <HI>Rebenack</HI> lately into <HI>Italy,</HI> to endeavour to bring the Princes of tho&s;e parts to imbrace your &s;ide, or at lea&s;t a good Neutrality.

<PB N="25" REF="17">
<P>He has orders to go to all tho&s;e Courts, by what I can under&s;tand his Negotiation will not be altogether in vain, having al|ready put many of tho&s;e Princes into a wavering condition. The great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> and the Republick of <HI>Genoua</HI> have promis'd him, and I hope the re&s;t will follow.</P>
<P>Sir, reply'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> mu&s;t he not al|&s;o take a turn to <HI>Rome</HI> to ki&s;s the Slipper of Innocent the 12th. on the behalf of your Maje&s;ty? for by what I can learn that good Father has more of a French Heart than <HI>Alexander</HI> the 8th. and <HI>Innocent</HI> the 11th. his Predece&s;&s;ors. Without doubt, an&s;wer'd his Maje&s;ty, for the Holy Father granted me al|mo&s;t all I ask'd of him, whereas the others refus'd me every thing. He has already granted the greate&s;t part of the nece&s;&s;ary Bulls, to the Bi&s;hops of my Kingdom, and promis'd to the Count <HI>d' E&s;tree</HI> to endeavour with all forwardne&s;s to procure a peace to Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>Now I think on't Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> how does your Maje&s;ty like the Baron <HI>de Chateauneuf,</HI> whom I took the liberty to pre&s;ent to be your Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Constan|tinople?</HI></P>
<P>Very well, &s;ays his maje&s;ty, he is a gown Man, &amp; come out of my Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="18"> where he pa&s;s'd for an able Man in bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and I wanted &s;uch a Man as him; for by what I can learn he is an arti&s;t in per&s;uading the Grand Signior. Be&s;ides, the be&s;t of it is that he is very well be|lov'd by the Grand Vi&s;ir, who has pro|mis'd him to hearken to no peace this Campaign, but even that, not without two hundred thou&s;and Crowns which he was oblig'd to pay him.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> Mony at this Day affords great help to your Ma|je&s;ty; and if it &s;hould come once to fail I do not know how all would go. That puts me in mind of what the Hi&s;tory of our Kings report of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, who was Sirnam'd the Wi&s;e that he without going out of his Clo&s;et, had always the ad|vantage over the Engli&s;h, and obtain'd all his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>After his Death he was called rich, be|cau&s;e at his Death he left 17 Millions of Crowns, which was a prodigious Sum at that time. I much doubt if your Ma|je&s;ty had reign'd in that time, whether you would have &s;ucceeded in all your En|terpri&s;es with &s;o &s;mall a Sum; &s;ince we &s;ee that you have a great deal of trouble to do it with the three hundred Millions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">f Livers that you draw from your Sub|jects.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="18">
<P><HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;ays his Mayje&s;ty, a Prince which is ab&s;olute over his People, and who is by con&s;equence Ma&s;ter of their E&s;tates, has Mines of Gold and Silver which never con&s;ume; the&s;e Springs ne|ver dry up, and are infinitely richer and more abounding than tho&s;e of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> and we &s;ee in our Days that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> that furni&s;hes (as we may &s;ay) all other Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> with all the Riches they have, and all the Gold and Silver which rules in the trade of each People and each Nation, is neverthele&s;s the lea&s;t partaker of it, and has the mo&s;t occa&s;ion for it.</P>

<P>The true art to reign, &s;ays his Ma|je&s;ty, was unknown to them, and they knew not how to make any profit of the le&s;&s;ons of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> and of the incom|parable <HI>Richelieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine,</HI> who have been the only per&s;ons that have taught it; &s;o that I do not &s;ee of all my Ance&s;tors why <HI>Louis</HI> the Eleventh &s;hould make &s;o

<P>He that knows not how to di&s;&s;emble, knows not how to Reign.</P>
<P>As to the matter of Mony, &s;ays <HI>Luxem|burgh,</HI> how does your Maje&s;ty like <HI>Pont-Chartrain,</HI> that the decea&s;ed Mon&s;ieur <HI>Col|bert</HI> recommended to you before his Death, as a Man very proper to manage your Trea&s;ury?</P>
<P><HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> an&s;wer'd his Maje&s;ty, doth me good &s;ervice in the pre&s;ent conjun|cture, and I know not how all would go if I had him not.

<P>He was too much hated by the People, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty; they began to call him Thief, they accus'd him of having ruin'd <HI>France,</HI> and made it a general Ho&s;pital; and yet he never did any thing but by my order, and acquainting me with all he did. Let it be as it will, he has been the In&s;trument of a great many things, of which I &s;hould never have thought of, had not he per&s;waded me unto them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, for the quieting of my People, I am glad that his death has taken this Ob&s;tacle out of their way that was a hor|rour to them; and as we love Novelties, we always flatter our &s;elves, that the la&s;t comer will be better than the former; all the World conceiv'd great hopes upon the Arrival of <HI>Pontchartrain.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I think that <HI>Colbert</HI> had gather'd together great Riches, which he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd as his own, and all his Children became very great.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, but after his Death the Water came to it's Spring, and I caus'd full and good Re&s;titution to be made: I made u&s;e of a &s;pecious pre|tence

<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> let us let all tho&s;e matters alone which do not concern the War; your Maje&s;ty has no time to lo&s;e, the matter in hand is now to pre|vent your Enemies, and be early in the Field, &s;o that it's time to take a firm and &s;o|lid re&s;olution.</P>
<P><HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> you have rea&s;on, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, and it is al&s;o for that purpo&s;e I caus'd you to come hither, together with my other Generals, to hear you one after ano|ther, and to have a private conference about what I ought to undertake.</P>
<P>But as you are one of tho&s;e in whom I have mo&s;t confidence; and that on the other &s;ide my de&s;ign is to make <HI>Flanders</HI> the principal Theatre of the War, where I pretend that my great de&s;igns &s;hall ap|pear, I will impart every thing to you with an open heart.

<P>Be it as it will, I &s;hall never forget the good &s;ervice he did me in <HI>Germany,</HI> and of &s;o many brave Captains, you are the on|ly one that is left me; &s;o I de&s;ire you not to expo&s;e your &s;elf too much, and to take as much care of your dear Per&s;on as my Armies. For if I &s;hould come to lo&s;e you, I &s;hould not know who to give the Command to, having for the mo&s;t part none but Lieutenant Generals, more fit to Command a party of Incendiaries, than an Army &s;o con&s;iderable as that in <HI>Flan|ders.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> coming every Campaign to Command him&s;elf, would de&s;ire no better than to have to do with a Novice; nor the fiery Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who al&s;o commands with him.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Princes fly round about my Army as a Bird of Prey about a Swallow, and &s;eek nothing el&s;e, but to make me lo&s;e a Battle to make way for them into <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>They made a &s;hew &s;ome years ago to have play'd this trick; but I made &s;uch &s;trong Prote&s;tations, and threatnings to come into <HI>Flanders</HI> with a great Army, without having any regard to the Truce, that they thought fit for the Peace of tho&s;e Provinces, and the repo&s;e of <HI>Europe</HI> to re|fer the matter to another time.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> all this good &s;ucce&s;s we owe to the taking of <HI>Mons,</HI> and the good Corre&s;pondence that the good Marquis <HI>de Gastanaga</HI> had kept with us,
<PB N="33" REF="21"> which was thereby di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;eeing the Spani&s;h <HI>Netherlands</HI> were &s;old at a great price by the covetou&s;ne&s;s of the Governours, re&s;olv'd to play a Ma&s;terpiece in cau&s;ing it to be put into better hands, who would make it their glory to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, can that be done without inju&s;tice, and can they di&s;pute with my Son the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> as they would have di&s;puted with me in the time of the Wars of <HI>Paris,</HI> that the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Queen <HI>Maria Tiere&s;ia,</HI> formerly Infanta of <HI>Spai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and immediaely after the <HI>Pirenaean</HI> Peace became my Wife, was brought to Bed of a Prince at <HI>Fountain Bleau,</HI> on All <HI>Saints</HI> day, the fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> a little before Noon in the year 1661.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> the <HI>Dau|phins</HI> Birth is not the thing in Que&s;tion; no Body doubts but he is truly your Ma|je&s;ties and the Queen <HI>Maria Tiere&s;ia's</HI> Son. We are well &s;atisfied with the fruitfulne&s;s of that Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>And as to what properly concerns your Maje&s;ties Per&s;on, you have, thanks to God, furni&s;h'd us with Patterns, taken from the Originals of the Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>de Fontanges, la Val|liere,</HI> and <HI>la Mourte&s;pan,</HI> who have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ft enough of Illu&s;trious young <HI>Sprigs,</HI> Wit|ne&s;s
<PB N="34" REF="22"> the Duke <HI>de Main,</HI> Madam the Prin|ce&s;s of <HI>Conti,</HI> and <HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Blois</HI> now Dutche&s;s of <HI>Charters.</HI> As for Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> who &s;ucceeded them, I dare not &s;peak of, becau&s;e I am per&s;waded it is a Soil where the be&s;t Seeds-men &s;eem to me to loo&s;e their time and trouble, unle&s;s God would make her a <HI>Sarah.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Blois,</HI> I mu&s;t tell your Maje&s;ty by the way, that they talk very much of her Marriage with Mon&s;ieur the Duke <HI>de Charters,</HI> in Foreign Coun|tries, and Principally in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they Criticize even upon the lea&s;t Actions of Kings and Princes.</P>
<P>All the World take upon them here to talk of Politicks, nay even the Wo|men.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that your Maje&s;ty has by this Marriage, and by that of the Prince&s;s <HI>de Conti,</HI> unworthily and without di&s;tinction, mixt the pure with the impure, and that if this &s;hould continue, there would not remain in <HI>France</HI> one drop of the Noble Blood of your Great Grandfathers, and that we &s;hould &s;ee no other in the Royal Family, but the Children of <HI>la Valliere,</HI> and <HI>la Monte&s;pan.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to my matter in Hand, that which is the Que&s;tion is, that the Allies
<PB N="35" REF="22"> pretend the renunciation your Maje&s;ty made at the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Peace has forfeited you your Right and Preten&s;ions, which you might have had to the Succe&s;&s;ion we were &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ty, it was not in my power to di&s;po&s;e of tho&s;e Rights, and to renounce them to the prejudice of my Son; according to all Laws, the Fathers have no right to alienate the E&s;tates of their Chil|dren whil&s;t they are Minors, and when the&s;e E&s;tates are Maternal.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> the Marriage was only concluded upon this condition; &s;o that the renunciation your Maje&s;ty made upon all the pre&s;ent and future Right that you might have upon <HI>Spain,</HI> or upon the depending States, was con&s;ider'd as the Ground of Marriage, without which the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Spain</HI> would have been guilty of a great deal of Folly on their &s;ide, to have con&s;ented to an Ally|ance which would have produc'd n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">w cau&s;es of Wars and Divi&s;ions, in&s;tead of a Firm and Stable Peace, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h was their chief de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I add to all the&s;e proofs, that the Cir|cum&s;tance of the Oath that your Maje&s;ty was obliged to take in &s;wearing &s;olemnly upon the Holy Evangeli&s;ts, that you
<PB N="36" REF="23"> would keep your Royal World that you then gave, was as the Seal of all the pro|mi&s;es, of the engagements, and of the good Faith of your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In your opinion, &s;ays the King, I am then very ill grounded in my preten&s;ions, and I have no right according to the Civil Law.</P>
<P>No, without doubt, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> but a hundred thou&s;and Men, a hundred pieces of Cannon, and a hundred Mil|lions will make the Ballance incline much more to your &s;ide.</P>
<P>It was a cu&s;tom to repre&s;ent Ju&s;tice blindfolded, holding a Balance in one Hand; but if the other had not been arm'd with a Sword, and had a Lion plac'd by her &s;ide, which is the badge of Force and Might, &s;he would have been but a ridiculous Maygame, expos'd to the violence and ra&s;hne&s;s of Men. So we may &s;ay, he that has the power in his Hand is the Ma&s;ter of Ju&s;tice, and whether &s;he will or no, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity betake her &s;elf to his &s;ide, and fight under his Standards again&s;t the weake&s;t, and this is your Ma|je&s;ty's Right. But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, &s;ince things are in this condition, and that I &s;ee my &s;elf Ma&s;ter of Force and of Ju&s;tice, &s;hall I not do well to pu&s;h my good fortune to the end, and to render my &s;elf, by my
<PB N="37" REF="23"> Armies always victorious and triumphant over all the States which &s;hall be at my di&s;cretion and &s;erve for my conveni|ence, having placed my &s;elf &s;afe from the oppo&s;ition of mine Enemies? Very well, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> there is no other ob&s;ta|cle which is capable to &s;top your Maje&s;ty but the Faith of Treaties. But that is another Go&s;pel for your Maje&s;ty for which you care but very little. We &s;ay of King <HI>John</HI> the Fir&s;t, one of your An|ce&s;tors de&s;cended from the fir&s;t Branch of <HI>Valois,</HI> that that Prince was &s;o great an ob&s;erver of his Word, that they gave him the Title of Good. He was accu&s;tomed to &s;ay, that when Fidelity and good Faith &s;hould be bani&s;hed the World, they ought to be found in the per&s;on of a Prince.</P>
<P>This Prince, an&s;wer'd his Maje&s;ty, did not know <HI>Machiavel;</HI> and you &s;hould have added at the &s;ame time that he was very unhappy during his Reign; and I do not doubt but his too great Goodne&s;s was in part the cau&s;e of his Misfortunes.</P>
<P>For having lo&s;t the Battle of <HI>Poictiers</HI> again&s;t the Engli&s;h, who were commanded by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> a great Captain, the King was taken and carried Pri&s;oner to <HI>London,</HI> from whence he came not out, but by the treaty of <HI>Bretigny,</HI> by which
<PB N="38" REF="24"> he quitted the Sovereignty of &s;ome Pro|vinces in <HI>France</HI> in f vour of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But all the&s;e faults of <HI>John</HI> the Fir&s;t were gloriou&s;ly repaired by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth his Succe&s;&s;or, who acquir'd to him &s;elf the name of Wife.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;ince your Maje&s;ty Laughs &s;o at the good Faith of Treaties, which other Princes look upon as Inviolable and adore as an Idol, I am not &s;urpriz'd that you have heap'd up Con|que&s;t upon Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>There is never a little Prince in the World but may be in a condition to make him&s;elf great by this means, and at la&s;t become the terror of his Enemies; but it is not to be wi&s;hed that &s;uch a like di&s;or|der &s;hould happen, for if every Soveraign &s;hould do the like, we &s;hould &s;ee a great number of Scepters overthrown to the ground become the Prey of the &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, &s;ince it is not per|mitted to make ones &s;elf great, what's the rea&s;on that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is Mounted even in our Days upon the Throne of his Father-in-Law? Is not that an U&s;urpation?</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> that is not &s;in|gular, Hi&s;tories are full of &s;uch like in&s;tan|ces
<PB N="39" REF="24"> and we &s;ee that <HI>Childerick</HI> the Third, la&s;t King of the fir&s;t Race was Dethron'd by <HI>Pepin</HI> the Short, who before was but Mayor of the Palace, which was a place almo&s;t like that of Grand <HI>Vi&s;irs;</HI> and his depo&s;ing was al&s;o done by the A&s;&s;embly of the States, after the <HI>Pope</HI> had declar'd that the <HI>French</HI> were di&s;pens'd with from owning that Prince.</P>
<P>So that the poor Dethroned <HI>Childerick</HI> had no other part to take, but to &s;have him&s;elf, and put him&s;elf into a Mona&s;tery. And as this di&s;grace happen'd to him by rea&s;ons of State, which would be too long to report, &s;o the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is not mounted upon the Throne but by the con|&s;ent of the People which call'd him to it. And the Parliament it &s;elf which being in <HI>England</HI> very near to what the States were formerly in <HI>France,</HI> Crown'd him and confirm'd him; <HI>nemine contradicente;</HI> &s;o the coming of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to the Crown ought to be call'd an <HI>Acceptance</HI> and not an <HI>&V;&s;urpation.</HI></P>
<P>According to this &s;en&s;e, &s;ays his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|je&s;ty, you are then of opinion that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is well grounded, and that the poor King <HI>James</HI> has no &s;horter Cour&s;e to take in the mid&s;t of his di&s;graces than to imitate <HI>Childeric;</HI> that is to &s;ay, to make a
<PB N="40" REF="25"> rennuciation of the Crown, &s;have him|&s;elf and &s;o put him&s;elf into a Convent.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I abu&s;e, per|haps, the liberty your Maje&s;ty allows me, &s;peaking open hearted my Mind, and what I think of the misfortune of this Prince. But as in the beginning of this Conference your Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to &s;ay you put a great deal of Confidence in me, I de|&s;ire you al&s;o to give me leave to ab&s;tain from the language of certain Para&s;ites who applaud your Maje&s;ty in every thing.</P>
<P>No, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, you do me a kindne&s;s to tell me the things as you think t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">em; that does not &s;urpri&s;e me, becau&s;e I have always given you more liberty to &s;peak your thoughts than any of my Courtiers and Coun&s;el|lors.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;ince your Ma|je&s;ty gives me leave to &s;peak what I think of King <HI>James</HI> and of the War which has been kindled in <HI>Europe,</HI> upon his occa&s;ion; I do not now &s;peak of a &s;ecret itching de&s;ire that your Maje&s;ty had from your Cradle to &s;urpa&s;s your An|ce&s;tors, in enlarging your Dominions, and pu&s;hing on you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Conque&s;ts beyond the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Sambre,</HI> and <HI>Meu&s;e;</HI> I &s;peak
<PB N="41" REF="25"> not neither of the Rights of the decea&s;ed Queen: I pa&s;s al&s;o in &s;ilence the Right of dependance, which is an old quarrel that your Maje&s;ty has with the Emperour, and the Princes of the Empire: I will hold my Tongue al&s;o as to what regards that &s;ecret enmity which has reign'd in all Ages, between the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and that of <HI>Bourbon.</HI></P>
<P>But I will come forthwith to matter of fact, and that which is now before us is, that your Maje&s;ty did procure to your &s;elf a War in the year, 1689. which is now four years agoe, and that upon the occa&s;ion, 1&s;t. Of the Univer&s;al Monarchy, 2dly. Becau&s;e of <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> the Ele|venth, who oppos'd him&s;elf to all your de|&s;igns. 3dly. Upon occa&s;ion of the <HI>Cardi|nal de Fur&s;tembergh.</HI> 4thly. To hinder the ruin of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. 5thly. To re-in&s;tall King <HI>James</HI> in his Throne: Of all the&s;e Articles I will chu&s;e but one, and with your Maje&s;ties permi&s;&s;ion will in&s;i&s;t upon the la&s;t, which is in my Opinion the mo&s;t important, and which I con&s;ider as an invincible ob&s;tacle to a glorious Peace, which ought to be the end of your Ma|je&s;ties Arms and Enterprizes. I &s;ay then, that your Maje&s;ty finds your &s;elf at this day in a great confu&s;ion, by the weight
<PB N="42" REF="26"> of the War which you are obliged to &s;up|port, which is one of the bloodie&s;t, the mo&s;t pernicious, and the mo&s;t burthen|&s;ome that <HI>France</HI> ever had. And really to run through all the Reigns that have pre|ceded this, we do not &s;ee that <HI>Charles</HI> the Seventh, <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth, <HI>Charlemain,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, no more than <HI>Louis</HI> the Thirteenth, have had &s;o many Enemies at one time upon their Hands.</P>
<P>But that which &s;urprizes me the mo&s;t, and which I look upon as a Miracle, is, that in the mid&s;t of &s;o many Enemies your Maje&s;ty equally enjoys your &s;elf, and gives your Orders every where with as much tranquility as if you were in a pro|found Peace. Things being in this con|dition I have but one thing to know of your Maje&s;ty, which I de&s;ire you to tru&s;t me with; after which I will ingage my &s;elf to lay down a way which &s;hall infallibly conduct you to a general peace in le&s;s than two Campaigns.</P>
<P>I have already told you, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, that I put full confidence in you, and that I have cho&s;en you as one of my be&s;t Coun&s;ellors in the condition I find my &s;elf; becau&s;e really I have re|mark'd, that my Affairs have put on ano|ther
<PB N="43" REF="26"> Face, &amp; run quite in another Channel from the very moment you took the com|mand of my Army; and I know not whe|ther my Enemies fear you more than my other Generals, or whether the Familiar Spirit, as is &s;aid, that you have to win Bat|tles, makes you Bolder and more undaunt|ed. Be it as it will, the Battle of <HI>Fleu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> which you won me, has been a great bene|fit to me: It has put my tottering Affairs into a good condition; and if any other but you had had the di&s;po&s;al of it, I &s;hould have run a great hazard of lo&s;ing it, &s;ince that fifty thou&s;and Men of my be&s;t Troops had a great deal of trouble to de|feat twenty four thou&s;and which com|pos'd the Enemies Army. I add al&s;o this circum&s;tance, that the Victory being a long time Ballanc'd by the great re&s;i&s;tance which the Enemies Foot made, and which you did not expect, you were al&s;o ob|liged to encourage my Troops, which re|fus'd to charge again the fourth time, and pulling off your Hat de&s;ir'd the Officers to put them&s;elves in mind of the honour of <HI>France,</HI> and of the glory of their Prince; which &s;o &s;trongly animated them, that com|ing to the Charge they oblig'd the Victory to declare it &s;elf for my Arms. I believe, if poor <HI>d' Humieres</HI> had been there to
<PB N="44" REF="27"> command as he was the Campaign before, the good Man would have been in a great deal of trouble. But I much doubt, <HI>Lux|emburgh,</HI> if the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had been at the Head of that Army, whether you would have come off &s;o cheap as you did with Prince <HI>Waldeck.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> when I &s;hall com|mand again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> I will content my &s;elf to play the cunning part; but when Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> &s;hall Command, I pretend to go eat his Bread, and to En|camp in his Country, and to lead him up and down where I plea&s;e; the rea&s;on of it is, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is &s;tirring and &s;pares not his own Per&s;on, pre&s;enting him&s;elf every where in a Battle, contem|ning danger, enjoying him&s;elf, and gi|ving Orders without confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, How did you do at the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Leu&s;&s;e?</HI> for he was at the Head of that Army all the Campaign.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> I took care not to attack his Army at that time, but I ju&s;t took the occa&s;ion of his departure, and with difficulty came to under&s;tand by Six of my be&s;t Spies, that he was Ar|rived at <HI>Breda,</HI> when I made the Hor&s;e march. To deceive the Enemies by a Strata|gem plea&s;ant enough, I took with me
<PB N="45" REF="27"> Me&s;&s;ieurs the Dukes <HI>de Charters</HI> and <HI>du Main,</HI> and we went all three to <HI>Tournay</HI> with a de&s;ign to &s;ee there a Play. We ar|riv'd there about Six of the Clock in the Afternoon, it was ju&s;t the Eve of the A|ction, which was to pa&s;s the next day about 8 or 9 of the Clock in the Morning, as we had contriv'd.</P>
<P>The Spies of Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> with which he was not the be&s;t provided, did not fail to give him an account we were at the Play, as it was true; but I had before given Orders to the <HI>Sieur de Roze,</HI> to <HI>Me&s;|&s;ieurs</HI> the Counts <HI>d' Auvergne</HI> and <HI>de Ville|roy,</HI> countenanced by the Prince <HI>de Soubi&s;e,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Congis,</HI> to advance very &s;lowly with about Sixty or Eighty Squadrons divided into &s;everal parties.</P>
<P>The Comedy which they Play'd, was <HI>The Phy&s;ician in Spight of him&s;elf;</HI> which being ended, one of the Players invited the Company the next day to another, call'd <HI>The Citizen turn'd Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Drawing near Mon&s;ieur the Duke <HI>du Maine,</HI> I whi&s;per'd him &s;oftly in the Ear, by my faith we &s;hall have another Comedy to morrow, not to &s;ay Tragedy, for it &s;eems to me as if it would not be very bloody.</P>
<P>That being done, we got on Hor&s;eback
<PB N="46" REF="28"> about Nine of the Clock, and return'd by the ob&s;curity of the Night near to your Maje&s;ties Troops. And by good Fortune there aro&s;e a thick Fog, which begun a|bout one of the Clock in the morning, which favour'd our march &s;o well, that we arriv'd at Eight of the Clock in the Mor|ning in &s;ight of the Enemy, who were &s;uprized at our coming, and taking advan|tage of their di&s;order, I Charg'd them with the Troops of your Hou&s;e, which I led my &s;elf to the Battle.</P>
<P>Now I think on't, <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, I under&s;tood that there was one of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Guards who came headlong with his Sword in his hand with a de&s;ign to kill you.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> it is true, and I e&s;cap'd a &s;troke from him &s;o narrowly, that he had undoubtedly taken my Head off, if I had been tall. But as you may, when I am on Hor&s;eback, take me for Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Scarron,</HI> I ea&s;ily put by that blow in crying out with a full Throat, Fire upon that bold Fellow.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, you dearly then bought the glory that you had to keep the Field about half an hour, by the death of my be&s;t Officers, and of a great number of brave per&s;ons of my Hou&s;e.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="28">
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> your Maje&s;ty has long &s;ince u&s;ed your &s;elf, to lo&s;e a great m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ny Men when you would have the advantage over your Enemies.</P>
<P>As it is my Maxime to attack them or|dinarily three again&s;t one, and that the Enemies who &s;ee them&s;elves almo&s;t always inferiour and more feeble in number by half, fight al&s;o like Madmen, that's the rea&s;on your Maje&s;ty lo&s;es more men than they; but &s;till you have the Glory on your &s;ide.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, if the&s;e lo&s;&s;es are frequent, and that the War &s;hould la&s;t four or five Campaigns, as in all appear|ance it will, I run a ri&s;que to &s;ee my &s;elf without Officers and Souldiers.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Peace at any rate, &s;hould it co&s;t even half your Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ects.</P>
<P>But, an&s;wers his Maje&s;ty, I had then rather hazard a general Battle, and come orderly into an open Campaign in the Face of my En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mies.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded that they would not refu&s;e it, and that would be infinitely more glorious and worthier of the name of Great, that I bear; imitating in that <HI>Charles Martel</HI> who acquir'd that name by rea&s;on of his martial humour, and of the
<PB N="48" REF="29"> great actions he did at the Battle of <HI>Tours,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> kill'd a hundred and &s;e|venty five thou&s;and <HI>Moors,</HI> that lay dead on the Spot. It &s;eems to me that an Action like that would be incomparably better than all the Tricks and Wiles that I have made u&s;e of till now, which are no more after all than &s;mall Rencounters, which decide nothing, and only lengthen the War.</P>
<P>No, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> that is not the way by which I pretend to conduct your Maje&s;ty, your Enemies would de|&s;ire no better.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> would Triumph with joy, and your Maje&s;ty cannot do them a greater favour, than to come as you &s;ay into an open field.</P>

<P>Thus, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh;</HI> your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t come at the Head of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and Men divided into three Bodies, the fir&s;t of which &s;hall be commanded by your Maje&s;ty, having un|der you the <HI>Mare&s;chall d' Humieres.</HI> The the &s;econd &s;hall be under the Command of the Marque&s;s <HI>de B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ufflers,</HI> and the third &s;hall be remitted to my Conduct.</P>

<P><HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, this enter|pri&s;e is great, and this place &s;eems to me Impregnable by it Situation; be&s;ides the building of a certain Fort which is called

<P>I know an expedient by which half of the&s;e difficulties will be overcome, and thus it is, as I under&s;tand it. There is in the Cittadel a certain Baron <HI>de Ber&s;e,</HI> which is a Major, a Man fit to do any thing, a high &s;pender, and much given to his plea&s;ures. I under&s;tand that this <HI>Ber&s;e</HI> calls him&s;elf Kin&s;man of Madam <HI>de Main|tenon,</HI> and that's what we want. But &s;ays, his Maje&s;ty, who has told you that this <HI>Ber&s;e</HI> will be a fit Man to hold corre&s;pon|dence?</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> it is &s;uffi|cient that he is given to Debauchery. Your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t charge Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> with all this bu&s;ine&s;s; and whil&s;t we &s;hall be preparing Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es, &s;he on her &s;ide mu&s;t attack the &s;tronge&s;t part of the place by fair and good guilded Letters, which will do more in one day than an Army of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and Men in &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>Ho! &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, if matters be &s;o, my good and dear <HI>Maintenon</HI> will do

<P>But what is it &s;he mu&s;t promi&s;e him in order to engage him?</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t pro|mi&s;e him one hundred thou&s;and Livers for reward, and after the reduction of the place, a Lieutenant Generals Po&s;t.

<P>Ha! Well &s;ays his Maje&s;ty; &s;uppo&s;e then for example, that he accepts the offers that <HI>Maintenon</HI> &s;hall make him, in your opinion what method mu&s;t he take to fa|vour the enterprize?</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> it is this, he mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place make an exact Re|gi&s;ter of all the Provi&s;ions and Ammu|nitions of War, which &s;hall be found in the Cittadel; he mu&s;t al&s;o make a very re|gular draught of the &s;trength and weakne&s;s both of the Cittadel, the <HI>Devils Hou&s;e,</HI> &amp; <HI>Fort William;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e mu&s;t oppo&s;e in quality of Major of thc Cittadel, to all that &s;hall be under|taken on the behalf of the Prince of <HI>Bar|bancon,</HI> who he mu&s;t al&s;o endeavour to en|gage, if that can be done.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t inform your Maje&s;ty or &s;ome of your Generals, of all the de&s;igns, marches and countermarches of your Ene|mies;

<P>Which being done, Madam <HI>de Mainte|non</HI> mu&s;t write to him &s;ome time before to pretend to come out in a Party and &s;uffer him&s;elf to be taken Pri&s;oner, as if it had happen'd by imprudence.</P>

<P>If that be &s;o, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, we &s;hall have as good a Bargain as that of <HI>Mons.</HI> But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is about to repa&s;s the Sea in order to be pre&s;ent here early, and by what I can learn here, may put him|&s;elf into the Field as &s;oon as I; and having a great Army, and being accompa|ny'd with the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> they may well di&s;pute this Conque&s;t with me; the&s;e two Princes are of a little hot tem|per, &s;o that this attacking them by &s;o &s;en|&s;ible an enterpri&s;e will &s;o inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ame them

But the arrival of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> in <HI>Piedmont</HI> &s;poil'd all by the great num|ber of <HI>Germans</HI> which he brought with him, which being joyn'd with the Troops of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> Form'd an Army &s;tronger than mine by more than half. This inequality of Force &s;top'd immediate|ly the happy Progre&s;s I had made in the beginning of the Campaign; neverthe|le&s;s without going out of my natural Seat.</P>
<P>I made all the movements I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to make, to cover the Country, to guard the Pa&s;&s;ages, and to &s;hun an Engagement, to which they would have drawn me, your Maje&s;ty having ex|pre&s;ly forbid me; and that was a great fortune to me to have to do with <HI>Germans,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="37"> who gave me the time well to retrench, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s my &s;elf of all the Po&s;ts, after having left in <HI>Carmaniole</HI> Four or Five Thou|&s;and Men, and cau&s;ed all the Hills and Pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Suza</HI> to be taken up.

<P>I acknowledge freely Sir, that this Project gave me a great deal of trouble, and that I fear'd very much that the Bal|lance would have lean'd to that &s;ide; be|cau&s;e truly according to the rules of War, and the true intere&s;ts of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and of his Allies, they might thereby cut out a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s for your Maje&s;ty, and put me out of a condition to oppo&s;e them, becau&s;e I &s;hould have immediately been obliged to divide the Body of my Army, which was already but too &s;mall, and I &s;hould have found my &s;elf in a condition to have held out the Campaign no longer.</P>

<PB N="68" REF="39"> advantageou&s;ly intrench'd; be&s;ides that the Winter which came on apace, did not permit that they &s;hould at &s;o great a di&s;tance, engage them&s;elvss in an unknow Country, and run a hazard of being cut off; that they might ex|po&s;e an Army to great danger by following the advice of</HI> Schombergh, <HI>and that that was not all, to enter into an Enemies Country, but al&s;o to bring the Army back again &s;afe and &s;ound.

<P>The Count <HI>de Schombergh</HI> being mind|ful of the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> intere&s;t, who had &s;ent him into <HI>Savoy</HI> to put him|&s;elf at the Head of the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> could not without being concern'd hear what Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> propos'd; and altho he was of a &s;weet and pacifick temper, a quality which he inherited from his decea&s;ed Fa|ther, as well as that that gave great hopes of his being one of the be&s;t Captains of the Age, could not neverthele&s;s per&s;uade him&s;elf to be quiet; he had too long &s;een him&s;elf idle again&s;t his will. Be&s;ides, he could not get it into his head whatever, he tryd to force him&s;elf to believe, that a whole Campaign ought to be pa&s;s'd in the Siege of &s;o &s;mall a place as <HI>Carmaniolle,</HI> whil&s;t they &s;hould neglect one of the fair|e&s;t occa&s;ions that ever was offer'd for the Allies to enter into <HI>France.</HI> He re|ply'd then to all that had been propos'd by Count <HI>Caraffa, that he was too old a pra|ctitioner in War not to have a full knowledg of the Situation of the Country, of the Roads, of the Woods, of the Mar&s;hes, of the Defiles, of the Mountains, of the Rivers, of the Bridges, of the watry places&mdash;, of the Pa&s;&s;a|ges, and in one word of all the places by which

<PB N="71" REF="40"> Allies, which was conceiv'd in the&s;e terms.</P>
<P><HI>That all the Inhabitants of High and Low</HI> Dauphine <HI>were exhorted to come and joyn the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ms of his</HI> Britannick <HI>Majesty, and of his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of</HI> Savoy, <HI>who came with a pote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t Army to their relief, to help them to &s;hake off the Yoke, under which they had groan'd &s;o many years.

<P><HI>That they protested that nothing in the ex|erci&s;e of Religion &s;hould be changed, but that every one &s;hould have full liberty of con&s;cience, like that the People &s;o peaceably enjoyed in the reigns of</HI> Henry <HI>the Fourth and</HI> Louis <HI>in the Thirteenth.

<P>Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> &s;eeing that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Schomberg</HI> came immediately to matter of fact, and that he maintain'd his Opinion by &s;trong proofs, and remarking be|&s;ides, that his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Bava|ria,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Leganez,</HI> the Count <HI>de Palfi,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Piane&s;e,</HI> who were all pre&s;ent, &s;eem'd in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be willing to applaud him, withdrew im|mediately out of the Council, and went home, prote&s;ting that he would remain firm in his fir&s;t re&s;olution; that the Coun|cil might re&s;olve what they thought fit; but for him he knew what he had to do, and that the Imperial Troops of which he had the chief Command, &s;hould make no other motion than what he &s;hould or|der them; that he knew the Emperour's mind, and &s;o it was needle&s;s to lo&s;e time in employing it to deliberate there|upon.</P>
<P>This way of procedure, which was &s;o little expected, extreamly &s;urpriz'd
<PB N="76" REF="43"> the other Generals. But the Count <HI>de Schomberg</HI> appear'd &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd at it, that he without any more ado pre&s;ent|ly complain'd, and al&s;o afterwards ac|quainted them, that he was &s;o little &s;a|tisfied in <HI>Italy,</HI> that he e'en re&s;olv'd to go back into <HI>Holland,</HI> or into <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> where he had formerly Commanded the Troops of his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Bran|denbourg.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was no le&s;s concern'd, that after having Travel|led through all <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> to come by hard Journeys into <HI>Piedmont,</HI> where he was expected with &s;uch impatience, which he did, notwith&s;tanding the acce&s;s of a Fever, which he found very hard to get rid of, without reckoning a Thou&s;and other unhappy mifortunes which he felt, during the length of his Journey: And all this in hopes to have gather'd Lawrels at his Arrival; if he met with nothing le&s;s, that he mu&s;t re&s;t contented, as al&s;o his other Companions, with an Idea only which they formed to them&s;elves of a Glorious Campaign.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was he who lo&s;t mo&s;t by the&s;e Di&s;putes, and whom the matter touch'd neare&s;t; but as he had not the experience of other Generals, he found him&s;elf not in a condition with a heat
<PB N="77" REF="43"> proper for the cau&s;e, to maintain an Opi|nion &s;o plau&s;ible and &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted as that of Count <HI>Scomberg</HI>'s appear'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he was willing to con&s;ent to it, becau&s;e they look'd upon this undertaking as the only remedy which pre&s;ented it &s;elf to incommode their Enemy, and to di&s;|charge their poor States from the In&s;up|portable burthen of the Auxiliary Troops, which would Triumph with Joy, &s;aid he, if they &s;hould &s;ee them&s;elves once Po&s;ted in the Enemies Country, to take their Winter Quarters there, which is ju&s;t the grievance of the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>But the bitter Draught that Count <HI>Ca|raffa</HI> could not &s;wallow, was quite another thing. He &s;aw among&s;t the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> plenty enough of all things. It is a Country flowing with Milk and Hony; whereas in <HI>Dauphine,</HI> he &s;aw nothing but Melancholy De&s;erts, and People already ruin'd by the War, which was more than &s;ufficient to make him take another re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was of the Opinion of the Duke his Cou&s;in, and their intere&s;ts were too common, not to be united toge|ther. He added that he could not think &s;elf-willdne&s;s was capable to produce &s;o great di&s;orders, and that Princes were
<PB N="78" REF="44"> happy when they were the only Ma&s;ters, and the Armies Victorious, when they were Commanded by one Chief; that the&s;e three years that the Wars continu'd in <HI>Italy</HI> their di&s;agreement had alone done more hurt than the Enemy; for 'twas this an|gry Godde&s;s of Di&s;cord that came ince&s;|&s;antly to trouble the mo&s;t important re|&s;olutions, and to furni&s;h new Seeds of Di|vi&s;ion and Di&s;pute, which oftentimes ari|&s;es from a &s;light occa&s;ion: That if the&s;e conte&s;ts &s;hould be kept up any longer, and that we &s;hould amu&s;e our &s;elves thus to pa&s;s whole Campaigns in deliberating, and principally the precious time which was de&s;tin'd to enter into Action, This would be ju&s;t to play the Game which <HI>France</HI> would de&s;ire; that we draw|ing our &s;elves in&s;en&s;ibly into Winter, which is the Mother of bu&s;ine&s;s for her, &s;he would have a new occa&s;ion to cry out as &s;he u&s;e to do of Victory, becau&s;e &s;he is a&s;&s;ured of her de&s;ign, and takes ju&s;tly the time of our Retreat and lying in our Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Leganez</HI> Governour of the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> was altogether of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Opinion, (that is to &s;ay) <HI>Piano veremo,</HI> and being full of confidence and good will, he catch't at all, and was ready to embrace
<PB N="79" REF="44"> the fir&s;t or &s;econd re&s;olution, or el&s;e both together, if that could have been done and agreed to with good Judg|ment.</P>
<P>But as the good Man is as great a Wit, as was his Predece&s;&s;or, &s;o he &s;eems to have a little more good nature, and the glorious Hou&s;e from which he is de&s;cended &s;erves him for a Pattern; he contents him&s;elf neverthele&s;s to follow the Crowd and plurality of Voices, for fear to fall into &s;ome Here&s;ie, if he &s;hould have dar'd to have advanc'd from his own Opinion a third project. In a word, the re&s;olution taken to enter into <HI>France,</HI> was the mo&s;t proper for him, and for all the other States of <HI>Italy.</HI> And if the Count <HI>de Caraffa</HI> would by misfortune have yiel|ded to it, that had been done. But as I have already in&s;inuated to your Maje&s;ty, I had &s;o well fetter'd him with Chains of Gold, that he &s;aw him&s;elf not in a condi|tion to make one &s;ingle Step towards it. Count <HI>Palfi,</HI> a good <HI>German</HI> al&s;o, otherwi&s;e a brave Man, and the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Piane&s;e,</HI> were ab&s;olutely of the Opinion of Count <HI>Schomberg,</HI> and could not con&s;ent to the <HI>Negative</HI> without regret.</P>
<P>The bu&s;yne&s;s having then been tra|vers'd by the &s;elfconceitedne&s;s of Count
<PB N="80" REF="45"> <HI>Caraffa,</HI> who, as I have repre&s;ented it, had no Body with him; but as he had on his &s;ide all the Imperial Troops which made the principal Force of their Army, he con&s;train'd all the other Generals in &s;pight of all they had to &s;ay, to &s;ubmit to the Law of his Judgment; &s;o that not be|ing able to do otherwi&s;e, they re&s;olv'd at la&s;t to act joyntly with him, and to open the Campaign by the Siege of <HI>Carma|noille,</HI> of which they made them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters after a great deal of re&s;i&s;tance, from a part of your Maje&s;ties Troops which fought bravely.</P>
<P>After this Conque&s;t they talk'd no more of any Project for the re&s;t of the Cam|paign. <HI>Caraffa</HI> keeping faithfully his word which he had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn, would hear talk of nothing more but Winter Quarters, for fear of violating his Oath, and pa&s;&s;ing for a perjur'd Per&s;on; &s;o putting immediately his Hand to the Work, he began to treat about Con|tributions with the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> who finding them&s;elves in more trouble than if they had an Enemies Army at their Gates, found no better way to take, to pre&s;erve Peace and repo&s;e in their Coun|try, than to con&s;ent to the payment of great Summs which they demanded of

<P>The Republick of <HI>Genoua,</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Modena</HI> will for a good while remember the coming of the <HI>Germans</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> and the other States will have no rea&s;on to forget them.</P>
<P>But to make &s;hort, &s;ince your Maje&s;ty orders me, and that the time to make your de&s;igns appear this Campaign, ap|proacheth, I will add only to all I have &s;aid already concerning the Affairs of <HI>Italy,</HI> that I thought fit, as I have let your Maje&s;ty know, to make advantage of the di&s;tance of the <HI>German</HI> Troops which were found di&s;pers'd here and there in &s;everal Countries, and to lay Siege to <HI>Montmelian,</HI> and &s;ecure by this important Fort the Conque&s;ts with which it had pleas'd God to ble&s;s your Arms in <HI>Savoy.</HI> I undertook then this Siege in a time, when the rigors of the Sea&s;on making us feel the utmo&s;t extremity, not to &s;peak of a great number of other unhappy ob|&s;tacles, which &s;eem'd to oppo&s;e &s;o great an undertaking, I found my &s;elf &s;everal times oblig'd to quit it; but as your Ma|je&s;ty

<P><HI>Catinat,</HI> an&s;wer me, I pray you, &s;ays the King, to what I &s;hall ask you. I have a great de&s;ign in <HI>Flanders</HI> that I pretend to execute &s;ome weeks hence, and for this purpo&s;e I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for an Army of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and Men. As the Troops that I have in <HI>Bra|bant</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> are not &s;ufficient to make this number, may I well di&s;po&s;e of fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and Men of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">oops which are under your command in <HI>Savoy?</HI> As you are the only one of all my Generals who knows the Map of <HI>Italy</HI> be&s;t, the de&s;igns of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the Genius of the <HI>Italian</HI> Nation, hav|ing travel'd in the habit of a <HI>Carmelite</HI> thro' all tho&s;e Countries, according to the or|der I had given you, in hopes that you would be one day more proper to do me important Services on that &s;ide, and it was you who had the care of the buying of the City of <HI>Cazal,</HI> having received the Sum which I had agreed with the Duke of <HI>Mantoua</HI> to pay unto him for it.</P>

<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>Catinat,</HI> your Province of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> which was the mo&s;t expos'd of all your Kingdom, and into which your Enemies have often flatter'd them|&s;elves to enter with a great Army, need to fear nothing further, &s;ince the tak|ing of <HI>Monmelian.</HI> This place as well as <HI>Pignerol, Su&s;a</HI> and <HI>Nice,</HI> of the &s;ide of <HI>Provence,</HI> are more than &s;ufficient to cover it and to put all into a profound &s;ecu|rity.</P>

That if once this Barrier come to be forc'd, my Enemies might from <HI>Dauphine</HI> enter into the Country of <HI>Lyons,</HI> Fore&s;ts and Boucollois, all being o|pen on that &s;ide, and do me more hurt in one Campaign than I have done to them &s;ince the War was declar'd.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wers <HI>Catinat,</HI> re&s;t &s;atisfi|ed in this, and let not your Maje&s;ty for this &s;top the cour&s;e of your great under|takings: I will take care of <HI>Dauphine;</HI> give me only the charge of it, as you have done for the time pa&s;s'd, and confide en|tirely in me.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the King, you may be mi&s;ta|ken <HI>Catirat.</HI> Do not you know that Men alter, as well as their Opinions, and that &s;uch a Re&s;olution is quickly ta|ken?</P>

<P>I wi&s;h it might be &s;o, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty; for if I were a&s;&s;ured of the contrary, I would chu&s;e rather to remain all the Cam|paign upon the defen&s;ive, waiting for the Winter to make a Siege, than to &s;uffer that my Enemies &s;hould give me on that &s;ide any blemi&s;h to my glory; and that a Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> whom I formerly treat|ed as one of my Pages, &s;hould boa&s;t to have encamp'd at the Gates of <HI>Grenoble:</HI> I believe I &s;hould dye with grief if that &s;hould come to my Ears: For what &s;hame would not that be to receive Law from a Prince to whom I gave it all the cour&s;e of my Reign?</P>

<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Lorge,</HI> your Maje&s;ties Army in <HI>Germany</HI> may amount to about fifty thou&s;and Men, reck|oning the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> of <HI>Phi|lipsbourg,</HI> and the other places; &s;o you may depend upon a Detachment of twenty or twenty five thou&s;and Men; the other twenty five thou&s;and which remain &s;hall be order'd for the pre&s;ervation of the Country, of which I can at any time form an Army of ten thou&s;and Men, which will be more than &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve the Enemy, and the re&s;t &s;hall be di&s;tributed in the Garri&s;ons of the Fron|tier places.</P>

<P>Sir, reply'd the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Lorge,</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> go not &s;o fa&s;t in bu&s;ine&s;s; your Maje&s;ty makes them gain at this time more Conque&s;ts, than they will make in three Campaigns.</P>
<P>They are too great Friends to their Ea&s;e and good Cheer to for&s;ake their Win|ter Quarters in the Month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think on't <HI>de Lorge,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, How did you Govern your &s;elf the la&s;t Campaign, which was that of 1691. for I hear that their Army was &s;trong.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> this Campaign was pa&s;s'd like the re&s;t, that is to &s;ay, in di&s;puting the Ground. But as the Con|federate Army, commanded by the late Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> came very late into the Field, which is the Original Sin of the <HI>Germans,</HI> that of your Maje&s;ty had two Months &s;ooner the Enemies Country at her di&s;cretion.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="52">
<P>After having caus'd the Forrage to be con&s;um'd on the Right and Left, as I had Orders from your Maje&s;ty to keep my &s;elf upon the Defen&s;ive, I repa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> upon the Arrival of the Enemies Ar|my.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> pretended to fol|low me; but as he wanted more nece&s;&s;a|ries than I to make a Bridg, &s;o I was on the other &s;ide before he was ready, and made my &s;elf fir&s;t Ma&s;ter of the be&s;t Po&s;ts. The Marqui&s;s <HI>d &V;xelles</HI> made on his &s;ide, with a Flying Camp, all the nece&s;&s;ary Marches and Counter-marches, as well to cover the Place, as to give fal&s;e Alarms to the Enemies. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Melac</HI> open'd the Campaign by thirty Villages that he Burnt with a very good Grace. As he is the able&s;t Incendiary of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o he has rea&s;on to hope for a Mare&s;chals Staff for recompence.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, How did then the De&s;igns of the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> end?</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> this Elector was a good Prince, made much of by the God <HI>Mars,</HI> but a lover of Joy, of Plea&s;ure and of good Chear; Brave otherwi&s;e as the Sword he wore. But as he was not ab&s;olute in the Army, and that I had the &s;ecret to divide them, I knew always be|forehand
<PB N="95" REF="52"> by the means of my Spies and my Intelligence, all the Re&s;olutions taken in their Council: Be&s;ides I do not know a Nation more lyable to be Corrupted than the <HI>Brabancons;</HI> at the &s;ight of a Golden Calf they all Humble and Pro&s;trate them&s;elves. St. <HI>Louis</HI> was a great Saint in <HI>Germany</HI> as well as in <HI>Flanders:</HI> I &s;peak as to particulars, becau&s;e as to the general, each People have their <HI>Scaevola,</HI> who had rather Dye a Thou&s;and times than betray their Country.</P>
<P>To come back to my Subject, the Di|vi&s;ion began, and the Sickne&s;s accompli&s;h'd the ruin of their Army, which coming to want Provi&s;ions by the defect of the Ma|gazines, &s;aw them&s;elves reduc'd to the brink of falling into great extremities.</P>
<P>The Elector him&s;elf having felt in his own Per&s;on part of the Evils, which be|gan to afflict his Army, went out of the Camp, and caus'd him&s;elf to be carryed, Sick of the Bloody Flux to <HI>Frankfort.</HI> Sometime after I heard of his Death, which made an end of the Expeditions of the Campaign of the <HI>Germans</HI> for the Year 1691.</P>
<P>But, an&s;wer'd the King, that does not follow, and does not prove that it will be the &s;ame this year. The <HI>Germans</HI> may come
<PB N="96" REF="53"> again to them&s;elves, make ju&s;t reflections, and enter into their true Intere&s;ts; and as they have a mighty Spur, which is the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> and have on the other &s;ide from Forty to Fifty Thou&s;and Men; if they &s;hould come all of a &s;udden to pa&s;s the <HI>Rhine</HI> and force you, I am per&s;waded that you would be in a great confu&s;ion, having but Ten Thou&s;and Men to oppo&s;e them. So that coming to lo&s;e a Battle, I &s;hould lo&s;e the Faire&s;t Flower of my Crown, and my good Fortune, which has promis'd not to quit me but in the Grave, would bid me eternally Farewel. Be&s;ides that, the <HI>Turk</HI> my Ally, whom I have till now &s;trove to rai&s;e up in his hopes, by the con&s;ideration of the Progre&s;s that I have made upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> would turn his Back upon me, and making his &s;eparate Peace with the Emperour our common Enemy, I &s;hould find my &s;elf in a very ill con|dition.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> do not forge unto your &s;elf Mon&s;ters for fighting them. The Picture that your Maje&s;ty now makes of the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Germany,</HI> is nothing le&s;s than &s;uch.

<P>Let us begin with the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> I do not think that your Maje&s;ty has any thing to fear on that &s;ide, &s;ince it is only a Me|lancholy remainder of what e&s;cap'd the Fury of the Soldiers, and the Barbarity of the Incendiaries, and by con&s;equence wor|thier of pity and compa&s;&s;ion than to be fear'd.</P>
<P>As for the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> he is a brave Prince, and who might be fear'd if he had Power in his Hands.</P>
<P>Let us go on to the Elector of <HI>Mayence;</HI> neither will he put him&s;elf at the Head of the Imperial Army to Command it, be|cau&s;e on the other &s;ide it is not his bu&s;ine&s;s. I am per&s;waded that he will be very &s;orry to have chang'd his Cro&s;s for a Mar&s;hal's Staff, and he ought long ago to have re|member'd the Allyance of your Maje|&s;ty, and to have, more than he did, hear|ken'd to the <HI>French</HI> Sirens, which ob|&s;tinacy hath made him become a Prince without Land, an Arch-bi&s;hop without a Dioce&s;s, and a Shephard without a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lock, and he would have been &s;till in the &s;ame condition if the Decea&s;ed D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ke of <HI>Lor|rain,</HI> and the Allies had not taken up Arms in his Favour, to recover him a part of

<P>Let us &s;peak one word of the Elector of <HI>Treves;</HI> neither is War his bu&s;ine&s;s, and his Sword &s;eems to me, never to have done hurt to any body.

<PB N="100" REF="55">
<P>As to what regards the Electorat of <HI>Co|logne,</HI> we may put them into the number of tho&s;e who have greatly &s;uffered, ha|ving been the Seat of War all the time that the di&s;pute between the Cardinal <HI>de Furestemburgh</HI> and Prince <HI>Jo&s;eph Clement</HI> remain'd undecided, and which was at la&s;t ended only by force of Arms, which had like to have overturn'd that State, and utterly to have ruin'd it. So that that Dioce&s;s will need many years quiet to repair her lo&s;t forces and recover her ancient liberty.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, the Prince <HI>Jo&s;eph Cle|ment</HI> is brave, and of whom there is great hopes; but on the other &s;ide he is too young to mea&s;ure his Sword with your Maje&s;ty; &s;o you have no occa&s;ion to fear any thing from that Quarter.

<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I do not pre|tend to talk off the Electors of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Bavaria;</HI> and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch le&s;s of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e Princes having a greater &s;hare in &s;upporting the War of

<P>But if your Maje&s;ty de&s;ires I &s;hould &s;peak a word by the way, I will obey you wil|lingly, and add to what has been &s;aid of the Princes of the Empire, that to what relates to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> we do not doubt but he is brave in his Per&s;on, and perhaps one of the greate&s;t Princes, that the Empire has yet produc'd; he hath gi|ven &s;ignal marks in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where he has done for his Age, Actions worthy to be put in Paralell with what the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Captains have done; I add to all that, that the Campaign of 1689. in which he Commanded with the late Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Army of the Confederates upon the <HI>Rhine;</HI> the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> to whom your Maje&s;ty had gi|ven the Command in Chief of your Army, had all the trouble imaginable, and was oblig'd to make u&s;e of all the tricks of War, to avoid a Battle; whil&s;t that his Brother-in-Law the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="56"> made on his &s;ide great Marches, and forc'd all that oppos'd his pa&s;&s;age to come to engage; &s;o far it is true that Hatred be|comes more and more irreconcileable when it is born among&s;t Relations or Friends. But the failing of Generals, by the Death of two of the greate&s;t Captains of the Age, <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Schomberg,</HI> and the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities that the Allies found them&s;elves in, by the progre&s;s that your Arms had made in <HI>Flanders, Savoy, Cata|lonia,</HI> and upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> was the cau&s;e that he went to Command in <HI>Italy,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he actu|ally is.</P>
<P>It were only to be wi&s;h'd by them, that his Electoral Highne&s;s would u&s;e a little more Circum&s;pection in the choice he makes of his Dome&s;ticks, and principally of his Mu&s;icians, who wriggle them&s;elves into his Chappel, in the Habit of a Prie&s;t or Monk, not to &s;ay of a Fox, for no|thing but to &s;ee what pa&s;&s;es, and di&s;cover to his Enemies his mo&s;t &s;ecret underta|kings; which is the greate&s;t misfortune that can happen to a General; and that he ought to endeavour to avoid as a plague capable to &s;poil all he does, to ruin his reputation, to make him unhappy, and baffle all his great de&s;igns.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="57">
<P>But it is an Univer&s;al Malady among&s;t all the Allies; and there are very few of their Generals, who have yet found the &s;ecret to pre&s;erve them&s;elves; and this is ju&s;t the defect of their Brea&s;t-Plate, and by which your Maje&s;ty carries even into the Heart your mo&s;t formidable Blows, and that all the <HI>French</HI> Generals look up|on at this day, as the Seed of the Lawrels and Victories they have heap'd up one upon another. Your <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> may con|clude from all that I have reported of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> that this Prince will be for the future &s;o &s;trongly employ'd in other places that I do not think we &s;hall &s;ee him any more at the Head of the Ar|mies of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>But the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, could not he come in Per&s;on, for by what I can learn he is to make the Campaign, without being able to under|&s;tand where he is to Command.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wered <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I have told your Maje&s;ty, and I'le repeat it again, that all the&s;e con&s;iderations ought not to &s;top the cour&s;e of your Enterprizes. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> has to &s;treight En|gagements with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to leave <HI>Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two Princes are in&s;eparable, and
<PB N="105" REF="57"> will always hold together Mutually to maintain their Intere&s;ts: It is not nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould enlarge thereupon, nor that I &s;hould &s;earch Proofs at a di&s;tance; the Cata&s;trophe th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> furni&s;hes a convincing Argument, and we may &s;ay, that this was the only Ele|ctor among&s;t all the Members of the Em|pire to whom the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had open'd his Heart, and put confidence in.</P>
<P>So the Elector on his &s;ide favour'd his de&s;ign as well by his Troops, as by the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hal <HI>de Schomberg,</HI> whom he off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">'d him with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l freedom of Heart.</P>
<P>So in <HI>Flanders,</HI> &s;ince the beginning of the War till now, and al&s;o during the time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> labour'd in <HI>Ireland</HI> for the reduction of that Kingdom, the Ele|ctor made it his chief Study to Act joyntly with Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> and we never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ve &s;een him come back again to the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e,</HI> to quit the Command of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">is Troops which are almo&s;t all in the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">vice of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces.</HI></P>

<P>The death of the late Electrice has al|&s;o depriv'd you of a good part of your be&s;t Intelligences, &s;o that to renew them in this Court, you mu&s;t implore the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> and be&s;tow behind the Curtain a good number of Pi&s;tols, af|ter which your Maje&s;ty will be Ma&s;ter of the Secrets there, as you are in all other places.</P>
<P>But, an&s;wer'd his Maje&s;ty, as to matter of Intelligence, I ju&s;t now learn'd with a great deal of regret, and al&s;o with &s;ome kind of trouble, that the poor General <HI>Schoning</HI> was arre&s;ted by order of the Emperor, and carry'd to <HI>Spielberg</HI> in <HI>Mo|ravia</HI> where he is Condemned to a perpe|tual pri&s;on. That troubles me &s;o much the more, becau&s;e I lo&s;e in him one of the mo&s;t faithful Corre&s;pondents that I had in all <HI>Germany,</HI> and in one word a &s;econd <HI>Fu&s;temberg.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall never forget the Obligation I have to him, and the Siege of <HI>Bon,</HI> where he found the Means to make it hold out five whole Months after it was Bombar|ded

<P>If the good Man had been believ'd o|ther Affairs would have fallen'n well out.</P>
<P>Sir, your Maje&s;ty will never fail of Spies, if you do but largely reward them. Money has charms who&s;e Brightne&s;s dazle a Man's Rea&s;on, and makes all things to be undertaken; and if your Enemies had this &s;ecret, your Maje&s;ty would not reck|on &s;o many Victories nor Conque&s;ts: But their parcimony has &s;erv'd more to bring your Maje&s;ty to the Period whither you are at pre&s;ent come, than your great and numerous Armies.</P>

<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, what do you hear of the Negotiation of the Peace between the two Empires? Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harbord</HI> En|voy of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> has he been well receiv'd by the <HI>Grand Vizier?</HI> I know the enterview was to be at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> what have you learnt, and what are your thoughts thereupon?

<P>Sir, an&s;wer'd <HI>de Lorge,</HI> I know from good Hands that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> wi|&s;hes for a Peace, and that the People will have it at any rate; &s;o your Maje&s;ty has no more time to lo&s;e, and there wants but one moment to conclude it, and to recon|cile the&s;e two Powers. The <HI>French</HI> Si|rens who are at the Court of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> begin to loo&s;e a little of the Charms of their Singing and their Melo|dy, as well as their credit. The <HI>Louis d' Ors</HI> are &s;o &s;trongly cry'd down at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that no Body will have a|ny

<P>I advi&s;e then your Maje&s;ty to pu&s;h on your great de&s;igns; the time pre&s;&s;es, prevent your Enemy in the Field; your Maje&s;ty being at the Head of a flouri&s;hing Army, may go fall on where you think fit, and carry one of the &s;tronge&s;t places of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I advi&s;e you again to make your la&s;t efforts, to come to a Peace, an to hin|der the conclu&s;ion of the Truce between the two Emperours, and if Mony is not capable to hinder it, to employ yet more Sovereign remedies, the Se|crets of<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Harbord</HI> poy&s;oned.</NOTE> <HI>Brinvilliers</HI> in the Hands of a <HI>French</HI> Cook are infallible.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Lorge,</HI> was gone out of the Chamber, the King or|der'd that the Count <HI>de Tourville</HI> and <HI>John Barts</HI> &s;hould come in.</P>
<P><HI>Tourville,</HI> &s;aies his Maje&s;ty, I have two great de&s;igns in hand, and I have cho&s;e you to execute the one, whil&s;t I am going to execute the other at the Head of an Army, of one Hundred and Fifty Thou|&s;and Men. There is no time to lo&s;e, the occa&s;ion is pre&s;&s;ing, and the re&s;olution is taken.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I propo&s;e to my &s;elf to re-e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="116" REF="63"> King <HI>James</HI> upon the Throne of <HI>England:</HI> And in the &s;econd place to con&s;train my Enemies, who have flatter'd them&s;elves to &s;top the Cour&s;e of my Conque&s;ts, to ask for a Peace.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Tourville,</HI> nothing is impo&s;&s;i|ble for your Maje&s;ty; you have a formida|ble Fleet which makes you Ma&s;ter of the Sea, &amp; which obliges your Enemies to yield you that Empire, for which &s;o many Na|tions have &s;pilt their Blood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> boa&s;ted them|&s;elves till now to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, but the glori|ous Fight of 1690. has decided it to the advantage of your Maje&s;ty, &s;o you are in a condition to undertake all that you plea&s;e on that &s;ide. By Land your Maje|&s;ty is no le&s;s formidable, you have great and Valiant Armies, always ready for the execution of your va&s;t undertakings; you have able Generals to Command them, who Work for nothing but the Glory of their Prince; and which is more, you have the Philo&s;opher's Stone in your Hand, that is to &s;ay, the &s;ecret to draw from your Subjects what Mony you plea&s;e, which renders you formidable to all <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and makes you always Trium|phant.</P>
<P>That's not the matter in hand, &s;ays his
<PB N="117" REF="63"> Maje&s;ty, I well know that I am fear'd, by my Enemies; but by land I have more rea&s;on to tru&s;t to the good fortune of my Arms than by Sea.

<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Tourville,</HI> if your Maje&s;ty takes the pains to run over the Hi&s;tory of your Reign, you will &s;ee many Victories that your Admirals have gain'd upon the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who are al&s;o yet as much to be fear'd as the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> becau&s;e be&s;ides the method they have of blowing up them|&s;elves rather than &s;ubmit, they al&s;o other|wi&s;e fight like mad-men.

In another Fight all the Enemies Fleet was burnt under the Canon of <HI>Palermo.</HI></P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, all tho&s;e times are
<PB N="118" REF="64"> pa&s;t, and experience has &s;hewn me in the year 1690. when you fought again&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which were in all but Twenty Four great Men of War, whereas you had Eighty Five, that you had neverthele&s;s a great deal of trouble with that great number to draw your &s;elf off from the En|gagement; and I do not know whether my Fleet was more damag'd than theirs; &s;ince you brought no other mark of Vi|ctory, than that of carrying back to <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> my Ships much di&s;abled without having taken from the Enemies one &s;imple Cha|loop.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Tourville,</HI> I vow to your Ma|je&s;ty, that my &s;urprize was great to &s;ee &s;o &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> number re&s;i&s;t and fight again&s;t a Fleet whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h we had rea&s;on to take for Invincible, and I much doubt if that of <HI>Philip</HI> the II. which was &s;o called when &s;he went to the Conque&s;t of three King|doms, was &s;o Fine, &s;o Formidable, and &s;o Numerous in great Ships of War.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, Sir, generally all the Fleet of your Maje&s;ty, fought again&s;t this &s;mall number, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gabaret</HI> had like to have been taken off with a Canon Bullet, and had more than Two Hundred kill'd aboard. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Ne&s;mo d</HI> did wonderfully well, but his Ship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">as &s;o
<PB N="119" REF="64"> maul'd, that we had a great deal of trou|ble to carry her off. Mon&s;ieur the Count <HI>d' E&s;tre</HI> was Wounded in the Leg by a Splinter, and had a great number kill'd and wounded aboard. The Marque&s;s <HI>de la Porte</HI> came off at no cheaper a rate than the Count <HI>d' E&s;tre,</HI> and his Ship was greatly damaged.</P>
<P>The Marquis <HI>de Vallette</HI> was obliged to Change his Ship, &s;o much had &s;he been &s;hot through and through; he had above half his Equipage kill'd without reckoning the wounded. In &s;hort, Sir, what I Re|port here to your Maje&s;ty is but an abridg|ment of the lo&s;&s;es we had, and I content my &s;elf to &s;peak of the Admirals and Chiefs of Squadrons, pa&s;&s;ing over in &s;i|lence a great number of Officers of le&s;s con&s;iderable Ships. But as to the re&s;t your Maje&s;ty had the glory of the Fight and the Victory on your &s;ide.</P>
<P>But that is not all, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, you will have a &s;tronger Enemy to fight with this Campaign, than the former, if I may believe my Spies in <HI>Holland,</HI> and chiefly at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who have let me know po&s;i|tively, that that Republick has re&s;olv'd to put to Sea for her <HI>quota,</HI> a Fleet of Forty five great Ships, which being joyn'd to Fifty that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will furni&s;h, will

<P>But do you know well, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, that the <HI>Holl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nders</HI> alone are almo&s;t as &s;trong in number as you will be?</P>

I &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o the advantage, that if it &s;hould happen by a misfortune, or by contrary Winds, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' E&s;tre</HI> was not in a condition to joyn me, Sir I engage at the Peril of my Life, to go and attack them with the Forty Four which compo&s;es the main of the Fleet, and which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> more, to come back Glorious and Triumphant.</P>

<P>Ha! what then! Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux.</HI></P>
<P>I am a going, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, into <HI>Flanders,</HI> at the Head of an Army of 150000 Men, to form the Siege of the Key of all the Low Countries.: <HI>Lux|emburgh</HI> has &s;hou'd it me as clear as the Sun at Noon.</P>

<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Chanlais,</HI> Gold and Trea&s;on are at this day two great double Keys to your Maje&s;ty; be|&s;ides,
<PB N="129" REF="69"> that they open all Gates, they operate more in a moment than great Armies do in a Summer's Ex|pedition.</P>
<P>Both the one and the other mu&s;t be had, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty; I have found out the means to tame the Lion and the Fox, which were heretofore incom|patible, and I only march now to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what I have bought before.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> that is not all; your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t &s;eek the &s;horte&s;t way to come quickly to a Peace; the want of every thing is a dangerous Di|&s;ea&s;e, which begins to be felt throughout your Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> you &s;peak home, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, and all the advantage I propo&s;e to my &s;elf, by this Ex|pedition, is to come to the way of a Peace.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> I have yet a &s;horter way, and more abridg'd than that, to come to a Peace.</P>
<P>Ha! what? &s;ays his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>It is to put in execution the Project that my de|cea&s;ed Father, the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Louvois,</HI> had begun the rough draught of, and which he left in his Cabi|net after his death; that is, the White that is the Center whereto all your Maje&s;ty's Enterprizes &s;hould tend.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t be done then, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty?</P>
<P>Sir, the Bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, is to &s;end the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> Chief of the League, <HI>ad Patres,</HI> if your Ma|je&s;ty will con&s;ent to it. It is he that &s;its at the Helm, and is the chiefe&s;t Promoter of this War, who draws by his Rapidity, the Princes and the Circles of the Empire, as well as the other States at pre&s;ent in War with your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Sir, added <HI>Chanlais,</HI> thereby King <HI>James</HI> will re|mount his Throne immediately, and your Maje&s;ty will impo&s;e what Laws you plea&s;e to the Allies, who then would &s;ee them&s;elves without a Head, and
<PB N="130" REF="70"> would be like a Flock without a Shepherd. The Dogs of <HI>England</HI> coming to fail, the Wolf would enter into the Park, &s;acrificing all to her rage, without Pity and without Mercy.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, how can that be? Such an Undertaking gives me Horror.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> that's not the matter in hand; your Maje&s;ty is in the Mire, as we &s;ay, you mu&s;t draw your &s;elf out of it co&s;t what it will.</P>
<P>But good God, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, if the World &s;hould come to know that I had con&s;ented to &s;o black an Attempt, what would they &s;ay of me?</P>
<P>When I &s;hall have throughly acquainted your Maje&s;ty, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> with the Importance of the Project and the ea&s;ine&s;s of the Execution, we will look out for Remedies to cure the nicene&s;s of your Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>What is your Opinion of it, then, &s;ays his Ma|je&s;ty?</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> I have two profligate Men ready, <HI>Grandvall</HI> and <HI>Dumont,</HI> who &s;hall be the Un|dertakers of this glorious Tragedy; I will charge my &s;elf with the Event, and will an&s;wer for the Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Ho! ho! &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, you have then your People ready.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> the late Marqui&s;s <HI>de Louvois,</HI> my Father, has been &s;o happy as to do your Maje&s;ty &s;ome con&s;iderable Services, during your Reign, and he would have added this to the re&s;t of his good Deeds, if Death had not cut him off; but having &s;natch'd him out of the World, when he thought the lea&s;t of it, he charg'd me, as his worthy Son, to proceed to the execution of his la&s;t Will, and to be A&s;&s;i&s;tant to this great Work.</P>
<P>Ha, ha, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, <HI>Louvois</HI> had then under|taken it, had he? I &s;hould never have thought that of him.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="70">
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> is your Maje&s;ty ignorant then, that the death of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and now of late, the Knight <HI>Harboard,</HI> hath been pro|cured by our means, with the help of a little Poy|&s;on? We have brought the Affairs of the War on the <HI>Rhine</HI> into a good Po&s;ture, and caus'd, on a &s;ud|den, all the Propo&s;itions of Peace to vani&s;h, that the <HI>Turk,</HI> your Ally, made to the Emperor. No Sir, that your Maje&s;ty may not flatter your &s;elf, you owe all to Poy&s;on, to Mony and to Trea&s;on; and if you had not on your &s;ide the&s;e great and mighty Springs, you would never with all your numerous Armies, have pu&s;hed on your Frontiers &s;o far.</P>
<P>Let us &s;peak &s;oftly, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, for fear &s;ome of my Enemies &s;hould be here; I would not for a hundred &s;uch Crowns as I wear, this &s;hould come to the Ears of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, added <HI>Chanlais,</HI> your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t know, That there is no Prince in the World who marches with more freedom and &s;implicity, than the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> He expo&s;es him&s;elf to Danger without troubling him&s;elf about the Event; Prede&s;tination alone rules his Motions; and we do not &s;ee him as your Maje&s;ty, an Idolator of his Per&s;on nor of his Pre&s;ervation: He is wont to &s;ay, That which God guards is well guarded. So, Sir, your Maje&s;ty needs only give your con&s;ent to the Undertakings, and we warrant the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, methinks <HI>Grandvall</HI> and <HI>Dumont</HI> are not &s;ufficient for &s;o great a De&s;ign, but that there &s;hould be yet &s;ome other &s;ort of Incendi|aries to animate and help them.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> without doubt your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t needs think that King <HI>James</HI> is the Head of the Party, and that there are eight Actors more, Per|&s;ons ready to do any thing, who&s;e Names are the&s;e, <HI>Grandvall, Dumont, Lie&s;dal, Rebenac, Bidal, Luxem|burgh,
<PB N="132" REF="71"> Paprel, Parcker, Chanlais</HI> and my &s;elf; if your Maje&s;ty accepts of the Propo&s;ition, you will give great encouragement to the Undertaking.</P>
<P>As to my &s;elf, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, I am not alto|gether my own Ma&s;ter; I have a Sovereign who reigns over my Will, and who has an Empire over me, much more ab&s;olute than that I have over my Subjects, I mean, the Guides of my Con&s;cience, &s;o that I dare not engage my &s;elf in the Cabal, before I have con&s;ulted my Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> the time pre&s;&s;es and the oc|ca&s;ion is favourable.</P>
<P><HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, then let my Coun&s;el of Con&s;cience be call'd, and I will con&s;ult them thereupon. The Reverend Father <HI>la Chaize</HI> going out of the Chamber of Meditations appear'd with his triangular Cap, accompanied by Madam <HI>de Main|tenon</HI> his Secretary, who carried under her Arm a great Book, in Folio, which had for Title, <HI>The Art to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Kings.</HI> The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> could not come, becau&s;e of the Di&s;patches he had to write to <HI>Rome,</HI> the Po&s;t being ju&s;t upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ts departure.</P>
<P>My Reverend Father, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, as you are a great Ca&s;ui&s;t, and that you, like St. <HI>Peter,</HI> have full power to bind and unbind with me.</P>
<P>What's the Bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, Sir, &s;ays the Reve|rend Father <HI>la Chaize,</HI> being impatient of knowing what he had to put to him?</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;hort, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, is to com|mit an execreable Attempt, and to know whether my Con&s;cience will not be charg'd with it, if I con|&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>What is it then, &s;ays the Reverend Father?</P>
<P>My good Father, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> has ju&s;t now propos'd to me a very &s;hort way whereby I may, this Campaign, undoubtedly come to clap up a Peace, and there wants nothing but my con&s;ent to have it ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cuted.</P>
<PB N="133" REF="71">
<P>As what? as what? &s;ays the Reverend Fa|ther?</P>
<P>Father, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, it has been re&s;olv'd to have the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, as he who is the only Ob&s;tacle to all my De&s;igns: and as this Prince expo&s;es him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">elf very much, <HI>Grandvall</HI> and <HI>Dumont</HI> have engaged them&s;elves to deliver him alive or dead.</P>
<P><HI>Opus plane Divinum!</HI> &s;ays the Reverend Father <HI>la Chaize.</HI> This Enterprize is all of God: <HI>Ab&s;olvo te,</HI> Sir, I ab&s;olve you. Thereupon, taking in hand the great Book that his Secretary Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> carried, he &s;hewed to his Maje&s;ty, by the Opinion of the mo&s;t celebrated Authors of the Society, to wit, the Reverend Fathers <HI>Garnet, Suares, Eudemon, Par&s;ons, Zimancka, E&s;cobar, Sancher, Saiman, Fili|tius,</HI> and a great number of others, That to take off a Heretick Prince from the Chri&s;tian World, by the Sword, Poi&s;on or otherwi&s;e, was a Work very acceptable to God, and the &s;trait way that led to Paradice.</P>
<P>But 'tis time we put an end to a Conference which carries &s;o much Horror with it, by the Devi&s;e of this great Prince, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ni &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u qui mal y Pen&s;e;</HI> and we will only &s;ay, That he hath us'd long &s;ince heartily to forgive all his Enemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Evils they would do him, and that he accounts it his Glory to pray to God for their R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pentance and their Conver&s;ion.

<PB N="134" REF="72"> as one of the principal Events of his Reign. This will be the riche&s;t Flower of his Crown, and one of his faire&s;t Pictures, capable to draw admiration from all Ages to come. But I can't forbear &s;aying here, by the way, That there have &s;uch things been done in the Reign of this Monarch, which yet pa&s;s, in the &s;en&s;e of his Flatterers, for Actions Great and Heroick, which yet, to &s;peak &s;incerely, are nothing le&s;s than &s;uch; and if we &s;hould put, as we &s;ay, the Hi&s;tory of his Life and of his Reign into a Crucible, there would be wrought a very &s;urprizing change; for in&s;tead of Gold and the other fine glittering Gimcracks, wherewith tho&s;e Juglers u&s;e to cheat the deluded Multitude, there would come out nothing but &s;o many Mon&s;ters, in different Shapes and Figures.</P>
<P>It is to be fear'd, that of all the&s;e Prodigies of Glory and Grandeur, which at pre&s;ent &s;eem to be the terror of his Subjects as well as of his Enemies, and as it were e&s;&s;ential to his good Fortune, there would remain in the Furnace only a little Dro&s;s and Smoak.</P>
<P>But hold, let us not go too far, but turn for once the other &s;ide of the Medal, and take it on the faire&s;t &s;ide. We will &s;peak a little of his Glory, &s;ince he loves it &s;o much, and it is his Favourite Pa&s;|&s;ion: We will own it true, that he is one of the greate&s;t Kings that the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy ever yet hath given us; that he is a very great Politician, very Wi&s;e in his Choice, and very Vigilant in the execution of a good De&s;ign; but then we mu&s;t ac|knowledge this too, that this Prince would be a very great Hero, if he would but add to all the&s;e ex|cellent Qualities, that one, of right knowing him|&s;elf, without &s;uffering his Courtiers to offer him &s;uch Incen&s;e as if he were another Divinity, and thereby commit that great over&s;ight which <HI>Alex|ander</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="72"> the Great did formerly, when he exacted that they &s;hould pay him <HI>Divine Honours.</HI> Let him re|member him&s;elf, that this was the fir&s;t Forerunner of the fall of the Empire of that Prince, and of the great De&s;igns he had conceiv'd of the Conque&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>I would advi&s;e him then, rather to rid him&s;elf of all tho&s;e <HI>Owls,</HI> who are always about his Sacred Per|&s;on, as Birds of an unhappy Omen, and who will leave him no more than the Devil formerly did our Saviour in the Wilderne&s;s, even till he hath pro|mi&s;ed them to do all the mi&s;chief they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Here is the Source and Spring of all tho&s;e Evils and Calamities, which at pre&s;ent &s;o cruelly afflict <HI>Europe.</HI> If this Prince would but once enter into his true Intere&s;ts, and would change his Council, we might then &s;ee him the Wonder of the Univer&s;e; The imaginary Immortality with which they flatter him, would then be a real and &s;olid one; which would procure him not only the Love of his Sub|jects, but al&s;o the Re&s;pect and Veneration of the whole World.</P>
<P>Here is enough for <HI>Louis</HI> the Great; let us go on to King <HI>James</HI> his good Friend.</P>
<P>This Prince, as all the World knows, has long &s;ince bid adieu to Glory, and therefore it may be &s;aid of him, That he is like an old De&s;erter who has &s;old all his Equipage, to go into the Service of ano|ther Prince.

<P>He went then to find out his Maje&s;ty, and told him, Sir, this is not all; your Maje&s;ty &s;ees your &s;elf at the very point of having all <HI>Europe</HI> upon your hands, and the War which is a going to be kind|led, will perhaps be the bloodie&s;t that <HI>France</HI> ever yet felt, not only in this Reign, but tho&s;e that pre|ceeded; and as your Maje&s;ty will have many Ene|mies to fight with, &s;o you will be obliged to have &s;everal Armies.

<P>After this Di&s;cour&s;e Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> ob&s;er|ving that his Maje&s;ty appear'd half &s;haken, thought that Madam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> would be of great help to him, to pu&s;h on the bu&s;ine&s;s effectually.

<P>Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> who is a true Siren near the King, and who &s;ees her &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Heart and Will of this Monarch, by her flattering Amours, was &s;o lively per&s;waded by the Di&s;cour&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lovois,</HI> that &s;he immediately e&s;pou|&s;ed the cau&s;e, and the intere&s;t of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lux|emburgh,</HI> and promis'd the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> to &s;peak to the King the very fir&s;t vi&s;it &s;he made, ad|ding withal, that &s;he did not doubt but &s;he &s;hould obtain the pardon of this unhappy Man, and draw him out of his di&s;grace, unle&s;s that the In&s;tances and the Intrigues of Father <HI>La Chaize,</HI> and of the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> &s;hould prevail over hers; that for him who was the chief of the Clergy of <HI>France,</HI> &s;he had the means in her Hands to appea&s;e him, but that Father <HI>La Chaize,</HI> would give her a great deal more trouble, becau&s;e this good Father was
<PB N="142" REF="76"> an Enemy to be fear'd, and it was by no means good to have him a party again&s;t one; that &s;he would endeavour neverthele&s;s to per&s;wade both the one, and the other, which &s;he al&s;o did, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Luxemburgh</HI> was no le&s;s beholding for his liberty to Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> than to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> &s;ince they equally labour'd for his pre&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>The King having been thus prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and the Storm rais'd again&s;t him entirely appeas'd, the Duke began to hope in Pri&s;on to have &s;ome more Liberty, and to ta&s;t &s;ome comfort.

This was done only to di&s;po&s;e by degrees the People and his Inqui&s;itors, to receive with le&s;s noi&s;e the news of his Relea&s;e. The time being then come that <HI>France</HI> had occa&s;ion for him, as the Marque&s;s <HI>de Louvois</HI> had foretold; and the King having expe|rienc'd the fir&s;t Campaign, which was that of 1689. that his Armies were ill govern'd, and that they did not Act conformab y to his intention, and as he had well enough laid the Scheam; that if on the other &s;ide his Arms had not had &s;ucce&s;s that year, it was not for want of Forces, and being &s;econded and &s;upported by great Armies, but rather the fault of the General, who was neither undertaking enough, nor cunning enough. His Maje&s;ty ha|ving caus'd the Duke of <HI>Luemburgh,</HI> to be call'd would in granting him grace and pardon take oc|ca&s;ion from thence to engage him by new favours
<PB N="143" REF="76"> to be more mindful than ever of his Intere&s;ts; and make that his acknowledment, &s;hould be a potent inducement to this General, to excel above all what he had done well and glorious for the &s;ervice of his Prince, in the former Wars, and particular|ly in that of <HI>Holland,</HI> where he had &s;ignaliz'd him|&s;elf by his Cruelties. And as the matter in hand, was to give him the Command of the Army in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> becau&s;e it was there where he had the be&s;t &s;ucceeded, if we except the Battle of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> the King wi&s;ely thought that he would not fail to make him&s;elf quickly talk'd of, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to feel new marks of his inhumanity, which <HI>France</HI> wanted above all things to oblige yet tottering Fortune to declare her &s;elf for her Arms.</P>
<P>It was re&s;olv'd upon, utterly to ruin the re&s;t of <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> to the end that he might be|come Ma&s;ter of them with more ea&s;e, thereby to force the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to hearken to new propo&s;itions of Peace, which is the aim of his Maje&s;ty, and the de&s;ign of the Court.</P>
<P>Experience &s;hews us then at this day, that the Marque&s;s <HI>de Lovois</HI> was in the right.

<P>Behold Mon&s;ieur <HI>Rabenac</HI> who walks a pace, let us &s;ee what he will have to &s;ay to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf for having had al&s;o a part in &s;o black of an Action. He will not fail to &s;ay, that the overgreat Zeal he had for the Intere&s;ts of the King his Ma&s;ter did en|gage him therein.</P>
<P>What &s;lavery is this, That a Mini&s;ter &s;hould en|gage to commit a dete&s;table Crime before God and Men, for nothing but to plea&s;e his Prince! But it may be he will perform his Repentance, whil&s;t he is at <HI>Rome,</HI> and ask pardon of God and of the Holy Father for &s;o great a Sin.</P>
<P>For Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Bidal</HI> and <HI>Paparal,</HI> we will put them together to make the balance even, becau&s;e they are truly of the &s;ame Metal and the &s;ame Weight.

So it is no very &s;trange thing, that they have plaid the &s;ame part in this Tragedy. Good God then have mercy on them.</P>

<P>But we mu&s;t not forget here the Encomiums of Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> who has made no &s;cruple neither to fowl her Fair White Hands in the Plot of an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate. She is at lea&s;t as much to be fear'd as the Godde&s;s of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> formerly was at the Fea&s;ts of the Marriage of <HI>Peleus,</HI> and would not

<P>As for the Reverend Father <HI>La Chaize.</HI> Me|thinks I &s;ee him appear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">olding in one hand the Sword, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h which the great St. <HI>Igna|tius</HI> was about to kill the <HI>Moor</HI> (in going his Voyage to <HI>Spain</HI>) who would maintain to him that the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was no Virgin af|ter the Conception.</P>
<P>Methinks al&s;o, in the other Hand he carries a Book in Folio, which has for Title, <HI>The Art to a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;inate Kings and Princes.</HI> But let us not enter into a Di&s;pute with him, for fear he &s;hould be oblig'd to borrow all the Eloquence of Father <HI>Bourdalou</HI> to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf. To rai&s;e yet again the Glory of all the&s;e Tragical Actors, we may join here to
<PB N="147" REF="79"> their Cabal, the Il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;trious <HI>James Clement, Barriere, Cha&s;tel, Ravaillac, John Iuvr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">gni, Venero, Balthuzar Gerard, Peter Paine, Parri</HI> and a great many more of them, as we may find by the Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rt of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">bad|neira</HI> the Je&s;uit, <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>ch.</HI> 3. who have attempted the Lives of the Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the Third and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, of Great <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> his Son Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth.</HI></P>
<P>But it is no a&s;toni&s;hing thing that we &s;ee at this day all the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o many brave Lords who have formerly witne&s;&s;ed their having had a Horror for &s;o dete&s;tablea Doctrine, to be never|thele&s;s blindly engaged in &s;uch a Cabal, after having cruelly underwrit to the death of the greate&s;t Prince of <HI>Europe.</HI> After this Stroke, I &s;ay, may we not &s;ay, That the whole Monarchy is at this day govern'd by Je&s;uits; and that in&s;tead of one <HI>Louis</HI> the Fourteenth, we &s;ee one Father <HI>la Chaize</HI> reigning and &s;itting upon the Throne of the <HI>French,</HI> giving his Orders, and making all his Tragical and Bloody Actors to perform their parts.</P>
<P>And as the Soul of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> is an Active Soul, and by con&s;equence, the mo&s;t conformable to the Soul of this Reverend Father, &s;o has he been cho|&s;en to be at the Head of the&s;e A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates the bet|ter to command them, and to add yet this Expe|dition to the Hi&s;tory of his Life, as the la&s;t Ma&s;ter|piece of it.</P>
<P>But let us come to our purpo&s;e, and confe&s;s, That all the&s;e Proceedings are made by <HI>France,</HI> to come quickly to her end, which is an advantagious Peace. Let us al&s;o add, for Concl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ion, That <HI>Louis</HI> the Great, often mi&s;takes him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Execution of his va&s;t De&s;igns; &s;ince of all the Re&s;olutions he had taken for this Campaign, Experience has &s;hewn us that he was out in his Account&punc; about the Imagi|nary
<PB N="148" REF="80"> Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of King <HI>James,</HI> about the Engagement at Sea, about the Entry of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> into <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and about the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating of King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, he made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Namur,</HI> which was one of the four great Undertakings that was the object of his Ambition. But then we may al&s;o own, that this Triumph has been &s;ufficiently counterbalanc'd by the ruin of his Fleet, and of the De&s;igns of King <HI>James,</HI> which are all blown into the Air, by the glorious Irruption of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who has put his Country under Contribution; and, la&s;tly, by the Shame and Infamy which will always attend the Ba&s;ene&s;s of having attempted on the Life of &s;o great a Prince. And here are the Events which have flatter'd this Monarch into the begin|ning of a Campaign, but which neverthele&s;s have not an&s;wer'd the great hopes he had conceiv'd. Let us &s;ee, at pre&s;ent, what he will undertake anew, and if his Projects will have the &s;ame Succe&s;s the next Campaign: Let us wait for him boldly, and make him &s;ee that our People are not &s;o weary of the War as his Subjects; and that if he will come to a glorious Peace, with which he flatters him&s;elf, and &s;eeks after with eagerne&s;s, he mu&s;t, at the lea&s;t, &s;urrender up all his Conque&s;ts.</P>
