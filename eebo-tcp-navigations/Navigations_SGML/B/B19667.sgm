<OPENER><SIGNED>CHARLES R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>_WHereas notwith&s;tanding divers good Laws made and Enacted for the preventing of the Stealth and Imbezlement of His Maje|&s;ties Stores of War, and for the puni&s;hing the &s;ame, His Maje|&s;tie findes by experience, that whether by the negligence or un|faithfulne&s;s of His Officers, or through difficulty of the work, tho&s;e Frauds, Stealths, and Imbezlements are not prevented (as they ought) but are daily practi&s;ed, particularly in Stores relating to the Navy, not only to the great prejudice of His Ma|je&s;ties Service, but likewi&s;e to the hindrance and di&s;courage|ment of &s;uch Trade&s;men, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion and livelihood it is to make and &s;ell &s;uch Stores and Commodities to Merchants Ships; who finding a cheaper way for furni&s;hing their Ships, by buying the Stores pur|loyned and imbezled, as afore&s;aid, decline the lawful &s;ellers of &s;uch like Provi&s;ions. For the preventing the&s;e and the like abu&s;es for the future, His Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed hereby &s;trictly to Charge and Command all His Officers, not only to endeavour the di&s;covery of the &s;aid abu&s;es (as afore&s;aid) but al&s;o &s;trictly to pro&s;ecute the per&s;ons offending, according to the rigour of the Laws in &s;uch ca&s;es provided. And for the more ea&s;ie di&s;covery of the &s;ame, and to the end the receivers of &s;uch &s;tolen Goods may not pretend ignorance, His Ma|je&s;ty doth hereby Command, Publi&s;h and Declare, That all the Rope-makers who &s;hall hereafter work in His Maje&s;ties Yards, or &s;hall el&s;ewhere make any &s;ort of Cordage for the u&s;e of His Maje&s;ties Navy, &s;hall make the &s;ame in manner following <HI>(viz.)</HI> All Cables, Haw&s;ers, and other Cordage of the larger &s;ort, &s;hall be wrought with one &s;mall hair-line through every &s;trand thereof; all Coyls of &s;maller Cordage &s;hall have two &s;trands compo&s;|ed of even threads, and the third &s;hall have one odd thread. The Sail-makers, working for the u&s;e of His Maje&s;ties Navy, &s;hall table the Sail with white Twine, whereby they &s;hall be di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;uch as are made for the u&s;e of Merchants Ships. And for pre|venting the abu&s;e which hath been of late practi&s;ed concerning Flags, Pendents, and other Ornaments, His Maje&s;ty doth hereby &s;trictly prohibit and forbid the u&s;e of His Maje&s;ties Colours in Merchants Ships, and doth Authorize and Command all Commanders and Officers of any His Maje&s;ties Ships of War, not only to take from Merchants Ships all &s;uch Colours, but likewi&s;e to &s;eize the Commander of &s;uch Merchant-Ships wherein after the Fir&s;t day of <HI>April</HI> next they &s;hall be u&s;ed, and to bring them to condign puni&s;hment. And His Maje&s;ty hath appointed that the Flags, Iacks and Pendents of His Maje&s;ties Ships &s;hall henceforth be made of Red, White, and Blew, to the end the Offenders herein may not pretend ignorance or mi&s;take. And His Maje&s;ty doth further Command, That on all other Stores, where it may be done without prejudice to the &s;aid Stores, or Charge to His Maje&s;ty, as Nails, Spikes, and other the like Stores, That the broad Arrow be put on &s;ome part of the &s;ame, whether by Stamp, Brand, or other way, as &s;hall be par|ticularly directed by the Principal Officers and Commi&s;&s;ioners of His Maje&s;ties Navy, to whom the care thereof is committed. And His Maje&s;ty doth hereby forbid all Artificers to make any Stores or Provi&s;ions &s;o marked, except for the u&s;e of His Maje&s;ties Navy; and doth likewi&s;e hereby Command all His Maje&s;ties loving Subjects, that they forbear to buy or receive from any per&s;on what&s;oever, any Stores marked as afore&s;aid (without particu|lar order and leave from the Principal Officers and Commi&s;&s;ioners of His Maje&s;ties Na|vy) upon pain of being proceeded again&s;t as Receivers of &s;tolen Goods, and as Imbezlers of His Maje&s;ties Stores. And to the end that His Maje&s;ties Officers may not be negligent in the performance hereof, or for any indirect con&s;iderations omit to place and affix the marks and di&s;tinctions, as is above, or &s;hall be hereafter directed, His Maje&s;ty doth recom|mend it to the care of His mo&s;t dear and entirely beloved Brother, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> His High Admiral, that &s;uch Officers or Workmen who &s;hall neglect or di&s;obey the Directi|ons herein contained, be di&s;charged from their Imployments, and be further puni&s;hed as their offence &s;hall de&s;erve. And for the better di&s;covery of &s;uch as &s;hall notwith&s;tanding this His Maje&s;ties Proclamation, Imbezle any of His Stores as afore&s;aid, His Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to Declare, That any per&s;on who &s;hall di&s;cover to the Principal Officers and Commi&s;&s;ioners of His Navy, any Cordage, Iron-work, or other Stores imbezled or pur|loyned out of His Maje&s;ties Yards, Stores, or Ships, &s;hall receive as a reward and encou|ragement for &s;uch his di&s;covery, one full third part of the value of &s;uch Stores &s;o di&s;cover|ed; Provided that he likewi&s;e di&s;cover either the Imbezler and Purloyner of them, or at lea&s;t the Receiver of the &s;ame. And for the better and more certain publi&s;hing the Marks which are not herein particularly &s;pecified, His Maje&s;ty doth hereby enjoyn the Principal Officers and Commi&s;&s;ioners of His Maje&s;ties Navy, with all convenient &s;peed to cau&s;e Patterns of them to be &s;ent to Shipwrights and Ironmongers Hall re&s;pectively, there to remain for the in|formation of &s;uch as are concerned in the knowledge thereof.</P>
