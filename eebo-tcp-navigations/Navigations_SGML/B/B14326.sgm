<P>_HOnorable Mi&s;tris in the waine of my litle wit, I am for&s;t to de&s;ire your protection, el&s;e euery Ballad-&s;inger will proclaime me bankrupt of ho|ne&s;ty. A &s;ortof mad fellows &s;eeing me merrily di&s;pos'd in a Morrice, haue &s;o be|painted mee in print &s;ince my gambols began from London to Norwich, that (hauing but an ill face before) I &s;hall appeare to the world without a face, if your fayre hand wipe not away their foule coulors. One hath written <HI>Kempsfarewell</HI> to the tune of Kery, mery, Buffe: another his de&s;pe|rate daungers in his late trauaile: the third his en|tertainement to New-Market; which towne I came neuer neere by the length of halfe the heath. Some &s;weare in a Trenchmore I haue trode a good way to winne the world: others that gue&s;&s;e righter, affirme, I haue without good help daun&s;t my &s;elfe out of the world: many &s;ay many thinges
<PB REF="3"> that were neuer thought. But in a word your poore &s;eruant offers the truth of his progre&s;&s;e and profit to your honorable view, receiue it I be&s;eech you, &s;uch as it is, rude and plaine, for I know your pure iudgement, lookes as &s;oone to &s;ee beauty in a Blackamoore, or heare &s;mooth &s;peech from a Stammerer, as to finde any thing, but blunt mirth in a Morrice dauncer, e&s;pecially &s;uch a one as <HI>Will Kemp,</HI> that hath &s;pent his life in mad ligges and merry ie&s;tes. Three rea&s;ons mooue mee to make publik this iourney, one to reproue lying fooles I neuer knew: the other to co~mend louing friends, which by the way I daily found: the third to &s;hew my duety to your honorable &s;elfe, who&s;e fauours (among other bountifull friends) makes me (di|&s;pight of this &s;ad world) iudge my hart Corke, &amp; my heeles feathers, &s;o that me thinkes I could flye to Rome (at lea&s;t hop to Rome, as the olde Pro|uerbis) with a morter on my head: In which light conceite I lowly begge pardon and leaue, for my Tabrer &s;trikes his hunt&s;up, I mu&s;t to Norvvich: I|magine Noble Mi&s;tris, I am now &s;etting from my Lord Mayors, the houre about &s;eauen, the mor|ning gloomy, the company many, my hart merry.</P>

<HEAD>The fir&s;t daies iourney, being the fir&s;t Munday in cleane Lent, from the right honorable the Lord Mayors of London.</HEAD>
<P>_THe fir&s;t mundaye in Lent, the clo&s;e morning promising a cleere day, (attended on by <HI>Thomas</HI> Slye my Taberer, <HI>William</HI> Bee my &s;eruant, and <HI>George Sprat,</HI> appointed for my ouer&s;eer, that I &s;hould take no other ea&s;e but my pre&s;cribed order) my &s;elfe, thats I. otherwi&s;e called <HI>Caualiero Kemp,</HI> head Ma&s;ter of Morrice dauncers,

<PB REF="4"> began frolickly to foote it, from the right Hono|rable the Lord Mayors of London, towards the right wor&s;hipfull (and truely bountifull) Ma&s;ter Mayors of Norwich.</P>
<P>My &s;etting forward was &s;omewhat before &s;ea|uen in the morning, my Taberer &s;troke vp merrily, and as fa&s;t as kinde pepples thronging together would giue mee leaue, thorow London I leapt: By the way many good olde people, and diuers o|thers of yonger yeeres, of meere kindnes, gaue me bowd &s;ixepences and grotes, ble&s;&s;ing me with their harty prayers and God-&s;peedes.</P>
<P>Being pa&s;t White chappell, and hauing left faire London, with all that North-ea&s;t Suburb before named, multitudes of Londoners left not me: but eyther to keepe a cu&s;tome which many holde, that Mile-end is no walke without a recreatio~ at Strat|ford Bow with Creame and Cakes, or el&s;e for loue they beare toward me; of perhappes, to make them|&s;elues merry, if I &s;hould chance (as many thought) to giue ouer my Morrice within a mile of Mile-end. How euer, many a thou&s;and brought me to Bow, where I re&s;ted a while from dancing, but had &s;mall re&s;t with the&s;e that would haue vrg'd me to drink|ing. But I warrant you <HI>Will Kemp</HI> was wi&s;e enough: to their ful cups, kinde thanks was my re|turne, with Gentlemanlike prote&s;tations: as truely &s;ir, I dare not: it &s;tands not with the congruity of my health. Congruitie &s;aid I? how came that &s;trange language in my mouth? I thinke &s;carcely
<PB REF="4"> that it is any Chri&s;ten worde, and yet it may be a good worde for ought I knowe, though I neuer made it, nor doe verye well vnder&s;tand it; yet I am &s;ure I haue bought it at the word mongers, at as deare a rate, as I could haue had a whole <HI>100.</HI> of Bauines at the wood-mongers. Farwell Congru|itie for I meane now to be more conci&s;e, and &s;tand vpon eeuener ba&s;es: but I mu&s;t neither &s;tand nor &s;it, the Tabrer &s;trikes alarum. Tickle it good Tom, Ile follow thee. Farwell Bowe, haue ouer the Bridge, where I heard &s;ay, hone&s;t Con&s;cience was once drownd. Its pittye if it were &s;o: but thats no mat|ter belonging to out Morrice, lets now along to Stratford Langton.</P>
<P>Many good fellows bring there met, and know|ing how well I loued the &s;porte, had prepared a Beare-bayting: but &s;o vnrea&s;onable were the mul|titudes of people, that I could only heare the Beare roare, and the dogges howle: therefore forward I went with my hey de gaies to Ilford, where I a|gaine re&s;ted, and was by the people of the towne and countrey there-about, very very wel welcomd: being offred carow&s;es in the great &s;poon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great &s;poone in Ilford hol|ding aboue a quart.</NOTE> one whole draught being able at that time to haue drawne my little wit drye: but being afrayde of the olde Pro|uerbe (He had need of a long &s;poone that eates with the deuill) I &s;oberly gaue my boone Companyons the &s;lip.</P>
<P>From Ilford by Moone-&s;hine, I &s;et forward, dauncing within a quarter of a myle of Romford:
<PB REF="5"> where in the high way, two &s;trong Iades (hauing belike &s;ome great quarrell to me vnknowne) were beating &amp; byting either of other. And &s;uch through Gods help was my good hap, that I e&s;caped their hoofes, both being ray&s;ed with their fore feete ouer my head, like two Smithes ouer an Anuyle.</P>
<P>There being the end of my fir&s;t dayes Morrice, a kinde Gentleman of London lighting from his hor&s;e, would haue no nay but I &s;hould leap into his &s;addle. To be plaine with ye, I was not proud, but kindly tooke his kindlyer offer, chiefely thereto vrg'd by my wearines: &s;o I rid to my Inne at Romford.</P>
<P>In that towne, to giue re&s;t to my well labour'd limbes, I continued two dayes, being much behol|ding to the town&s;-men for their loue, but more to the Londoners, that came hourely thither in great numbers to vi&s;ite me: offring much more kindnes then I was willing to accept.</P>

<HEAD>The &s;econd dayes iourney, beeing Thur&s;day of the fir&s;t vveeke.</HEAD>
<P>THur&s;day being Market day at Burnt-wood, <HI>Tom Slye</HI> was earlyer vp then the Lark, and &s;ounded merrily the Morrice: I row&s;ed my &s;elfe, and returned from Romford to the place wher I tooke hor&s;e the fir&s;t night, dauncing that quarter of a myle backe againe thorow Romford, and &s;o me|rily to Burnt-wood: yet now I remember it well, I had no great cau&s;e of mirth, for at Romford
<PB REF="5"> townes end I &s;trained my hip, and for a time indu|red exceeding paine: but being loath to trouble a Surgeon I held on, finding remedy by labour that had hurt mee, for it came in a turne, and &s;o in my daunce I turned it out of my &s;eruice againe.</P>
<P>The multitudes were &s;o great at my comming to Burntwood, that I had much a doe (though I made many intreaties and &s;taies) to get pa&s;&s;age to my Inne.</P>
<P>In this towne two Cut-pur&s;es were taken, that with other two of their companions followed mee from Lo~don (as many better di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons did:) but the&s;e two dy-doppers gaue out when they were apprehended, that they had laid wagers and betted about my iourney. Wherupon the Officers bring|ing them to my Inne, I iu&s;tly denyed their ac|quaintance, &s;auing that I remembred one of them to be a noted Cut-pur&s;e, &s;uch a one as we tye to a poa&s;t on our &s;tage, for all people to wonder at, when at a play they are taken pilfring.</P>
<P>This fellow &amp; his half brother being found with the deed, were &s;ent to Iayle: their other two con|&s;orts had the charity of the towne, &amp; after a dance of Trenchmore at the whipping cro&s;&s;e, they were &s;ent backe to London: where I am afraide there are too many of their occupation. To bee &s;hort I thought my&s;elfe well rid of foure &s;uch followers, and I wi&s;h hartily that the whole world were cleer of &s;uch companions.</P>
<P>Hauing re&s;ted well at Burntwood, the Moone
<PB REF="6"> &s;hining clearely, and the weather being calme, in the euening I tript it to Inger&s;tone, &s;tealing away from tho&s;e numbers of people that followed mee: yet doe I what I could, I had aboue fiftie in the company, &s;ome of London, the other of the Country thereabout, that would needs when they heard my Taber, trudge after me through thicke and thin.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="day">
<HEAD>The third dayes iourney, being Friday of the fir&s;t weeke.</HEAD>
<P>ON Friday morning I &s;et forward towardes Chelm&s;ford, not hauing pa&s;t two hundred, be|ing the lea&s;t company that I had in the day time: betweene London and that place. Onward I went thus ea&s;ily followed, till I come to Witford-bridge, where a number of country people, and many Gen|tlemen and Gentlewomen, were gathered together to &s;ee me. Sir Thomas Mildmay &s;tanding at his Parke pale, receiued gently a payre of garters of me: gloues, points, and garters, being my ordinary marchandize, that I put out to venter for perfor|mance of my merry voyage.</P>
<P>So much a doe I had to pa&s;&s;e by the people at Chelm&s;ford, that it was more than an houre ere I could recouer my Inne gate, where I was faine to locke my &s;elfe in my Chamber, and pacifie them with wordes out of a window in&s;teed of deeds: to deale plainely I was &s;o weary, that I could dance no more.</P>
<PB REF="6">
<P>The next morning I footed it three myle of my way toward Braintree: but returned backe a|gaine to Chelm&s;ford, where I lay that Satterday and the next Sunday. The good cheere and kinde welcome I had at Chelm&s;ford, was much more than I was willing to entertaine: for my onely de|&s;ire was to refraine drinke, and be temperate in my dyet.</P>
<P>At Chelm&s;ford a Mayde not pa&s;&s;ing foureteene yeares of age, dwelling with one Sudley my kinde friend, made reque&s;t to her Ma&s;ter and Dame, that &s;he might daunce the Morrice with me in a great large roome. They being intreated, I was &s;oone wonne, to fit her with bels, be&s;ides &s;he would haue the olde fa&s;hion with napking on her armes, and to our iumps we fell. A whole houre &s;he held out: but then being ready to lye downe I left her off: but thus much in her prai&s;e, I would haue challenged the &s;tronge&s;t man in Chelm&s;ford, and among&s;t many I thinke few would haue done &s;o much.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="day">
<HEAD>The fourth dayes iourney, beeing Munday of the &s;econd vveeke.</HEAD>
<P>ON Munday morning very early, I rid the <HI>3.</HI> myles that I daun&s;t the &s;atterday before: where
<PB REF="7"> alighting, my Taberer &s;trucke vp, and lightly I tript forward, but I had the heauie&s;t way that e|uer mad Morrice-dancer trod: yet
<Q><LG TYPE="song">
<L><HI>With hey and ho, through thicke and thin,</HI></L>
<L><HI>the hobby hor&s;e quite forgotten,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I follow'd as I did begin,</HI></L>
<L><HI>although the way were rotten.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>This foule way I could finde no ea&s;e in, thicke woods being on eyther &s;ide the lane: the lane like|wi&s;e being full of deep holes, &s;ometimes I &s;kipt vp to the wa&s;te: but it is an old Prouerb. That it is a little comfort to the mi&s;erable to haue companions, and amid&s;t this miry way, I had &s;ome mirth by an vnlookt for accident.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tome of hone&s;t Country fellows my vnknowne friends, vpon hearing of my Pype (which might well be heard in a &s;till morning or e|uening a myle) to get vp and beare mee company a little way. In this foule way two pretty plaine youthes watcht me, and with their kindnes &s;ome|what hindred me. One a fine light fellow would be &s;till before me, the other euer at my heeles. At length comming to a broad pla&s;h of water and mud, which could not be auoyded, I fetcht a ri&s;e, yet fell in ouer the anckles at the further end. My youth that fol|low'd me, tooke his iump, and &s;tuck fa&s;t in the mid&s;t, crying out to his companion, come George, call yee this dauncing, Ile goe no further: for indeede hee
<PB REF="7"> could goe no further, till his fellow was faine to wade and help him out. I could not chu&s;e but lough to &s;ee howe like two frogges they laboured: a har|tye farwell I gaue them, and they faintly bad God &s;peed me, &s;aying if I daun&s;t that durtie way this &s;eauen yeares againe, they would neuer daunce af|ter me.</P>
<P>Well, with much a doo I got vnto Braintree by noone, tarried there Munday night and the next day: onely I daun&s;t three miles on Tew&s;day, to ea&s;e my Wedne&s;daies iourney.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould deny that I was welcome at Brain|tree, I &s;hould &s;lander an hone&s;t crew of kind men, among whome I far'd well, &s;lept well, and was euery way well v&s;de.</P>

<P>TAking aduantage of my <HI>3.</HI> miles that I had daun&s;t y^e day before, this wedne&s;day morning I tript it to Sudbury, whether came to &s;ee a very kinde Gentleman Ma&s;ter Fo&s;kew, that had before trauailed a foote from London to Barwick: who giuing me good coun&s;aile to ob&s;erue temperate dyet for my health, and other adui&s;e to bee carefull of my company, be&s;ides his liberall entertain|ment, departed leauing me much indebted to his loue.</P>
<P>In this towne of Sudbury, there came a lu&s;ty
<PB REF="8"> tall fellow, a butcher by his profe&s;&s;ion, that would in a Morrice keepe mee company to Bury: I being glad of his friendly offer, gaue him thankes, and for|ward wee did &s;et: but ere euer wee had mea&s;ur'd halfe a mile of our way, he gaue me ouer in the plain field, prote&s;ting, that if he might get a <HI>100.</HI> pound, he would not hold out with me; for indeed my pace in dauncing is not ordinary.</P>
<P>As he and I were parting, a lu&s;ty Country la&s;&s;e being among the people, cal'd him faint hearted lout: &s;aying, if I had begun to daunce, I would haue held out one myle though it had co&s;t my life. At which wordes many laughed. Nay &s;aith &s;he, if the Dauncer will lend me a lea&s;h of his belles, Ile venter to treade one mile with him my &s;elfe. I lookt vpon her, &s;aw mirth in her eies, heard boldnes in her words, and beheld her ready to tucke vp her ru&s;&s;et petticoate, I fitted her with bels: which he merrily taking, garni&s;ht her thicke &s;hort legs, and with a &s;mooth brow bad the Tabrer begin. The Drum &s;trucke, forward marcht I with my merry Mayde|marian: who &s;hooke her fat &s;ides: and footed it mer|rily to Melfoord, bring a long myle. There parting with her, I gaue her (be&s;ides her &s;kinfull of drinke) an Engli&s;h crowne to buy more drinke, for good wench &s;he was in a pittious heate: my kindnes &s;he required with dropping &s;ome dozen of &s;hort court|&s;ies, and bidding God ble&s;&s;e the Dauncer, I bad her adieu: and to giue her her due, &s;he had a good care, daun&s;t truely, and wee parted friendly.

<P>At Melford, diuers Gentlemen met mee, who brought me to one ma&s;ter Colts, a very kinde and wor&s;hipfull Gentleman, where I had vnexpected entertainment till the Satterday.

<P>FRom Wedne&s;day night til Satterday hauing bin very trouble&s;ome, but much more welcome to ma&s;ter Colts: in the morning I tooke my leaue, and was accompanied with many Gentle|men a myle of my way. Which myle ma&s;ter Colts his foole would needs daunce with me, and had his de&s;ire, where leauing me, two fooles parted faire in a foule way: I keeping on my cour&s;e to Clare, where I a while re&s;ted, and then cheerefully &s;et forward to Bury.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from Clare towards Bury, I was inuit|ted to the hou&s;e of a very bountiful widdow, who&s;e hu&s;band during his life was a Yeoman of that Countrie, dying rich no doubt, as might well ap|peare, by the riches and plentie, that abounded in euery corner of the hou&s;e.

<P>At her hou&s;e were met aboue thirty Gentlemen. Such, and &s;o plentifull variety of good fare, I haue very &s;ildome &s;eene in any Commoners hou&s;e. Her behauiour being very mode&s;t and freendly, argued her bringing vp not to be rude. She was a woman of good pre&s;ence: and if a foole may iudge, of no &s;mal di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>From this widdowes I daun&s;t to Bury, com|ming in on the Satterday in the afternoone, at

But indeed con|&s;idering how I had been booted the other iourneys before, and that all this way or the mo&s;t of it was o|uer a heath, it was no great wonder: for I far'd like one that had e&s;caped the &s;tockes, and tride the v&s;e of his legs to out run the Con&s;table: &s;o light was my heeles, that I counted the ten mile no better than a leape.</P>

<PB REF="10"> began with. All this: ble&s;&s;ing the houre vppon his knees, that any of the Queenes Maie&s;ties well-willers or friends would vouch&s;afe to come with|in his hou&s;e: as if neuer any &s;uch had been within his doores before.</P>
<P>I tooke his good meaning, and gaue him great thankes for his kindene&s;&s;e: and hauing re&s;ted mee well, began to take my cour&s;e for Hingham, whe|ther my hone&s;t Hoa&s;t of Rockland would needs be my guide: but good true fat-belly he had not fol|lowed mee two fieldes, but he lyes all along, and cryes after me to come backe and &s;peake with him.

<P>I hauing ha&s;te of my way, and he being able to keep no way, there wee parted. Farewell he, he was a kinde good fellow, a true Troyan: and it euer be my lucks to meete him at more lea&s;ure, Ile make him full amendes with a Cup full of Canarie.

<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the gate, Wifflers (&s;uch Officers as were appointed by the Mayor) to make me way through the throng of the people, which pre&s;t &s;o mightily vp|on me: with great labour I got thorow that nar|row preaze into the open market place. Where on the cro&s;&s;e, ready prepared, &s;tood the Citty Waytes, which not a little refre&s;hed my wearines with toy|ling thorow &s;o narrow a lane, as the people left me: &s;uch Waytes (vnder Benedicite be it &s;poken) fewe Citties in our Realme haue the like, none better.

<P>Pa&s;&s;ing by the Market place, the pre&s;&s;e &s;till in|crea&s;ing
<PB REF="13"> by the number of boyes, girles, men and women, thronging more and more before me to &s;ee the end. It was the mi&s;chaunce of a homely maide, that belike, was but newly crept into the fa&s;hion of long wa&s;ted peticotes tyde with points, &amp; had, as it &s;eemed but one point tyed before, and comming vn|luckily in my way, as I was fetching a leape, it fell out that I &s;et my foote on her &s;kirts: the point ey|ther breaking or &s;tretching, off fell her peticoate from her wa&s;te, but as chance was, thogh hir &s;mock were cour&s;e, it was cleanely: yet the poore wench was &s;o a&s;hamed, the rather for that &s;he could hardly recouer her coate againe from vnruly boies, that loo|king before like one that had the greene &s;ickne&s;&s;e, now had &s;he her cheekes all coloured with &s;carlet. I was &s;orry for her, but on I went towards the Mai|ors, and deceiued the people, by leaping ouer the Church-yard wall at S. Iohns, getting &s;o into M. Mayors gates a neerer way: but at la&s;t I found it the further way about: being forced on the Tew&s;|day following to renew my former daunce, becau&s;e George Sprat my ouer-&s;eer hauing lo&s;t me in the throug, would not be depo&s;ed that I had daun&s;t it, &s;ince he &s;aw me not: and I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e I did not wel, for the Cittizens had cau&s;ed all the turne-pikes to be taken vp on Satterday, that I might not bee hindred. But now I returne againe to my Iump, the mea&s;ure of which is to be &s;eene in the Guild-hall at Norwich, where my bu&s;kins, that I then wore, and daun&s;t in from London thither, &s;tand equally
<PB REF="14"> deuided, nailde on the wall. The plenty of good cheere at the Mayors, his bounty, and kinde v&s;age, together with the general welcomes of his wor&s;hip|ful brethren, and many other knights, Ladies, Gen|tlemen &amp; Gentlewomen, &s;o much exceeded my expec|tation, as I adiudg'd my &s;elfe mo&s;t bound to them all. The Maior gaue me fiue pound in <HI>El&s;abeth</HI> an|gels: which Maior (faire Madame, to whom I too pre&s;umptuou&s;ly dedicate my idle paces) as a man worthy of a finguler and impartiall admiration, if our criticke humorous mindes could as prodigally conceiue as he de&s;erues, for his cha&s;t life, liberality, &amp; temperance in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing worldly benefits: he liues vnmarried, and childle&s;&s;e, neuer purcha&s;ed hou&s;e nor land: the hou&s;e he dwels in this yeere, being but hy|red: he liues vpon marchandies, being a Marchant venturer. If our marchants &amp; gentlemen wold take example by this man, Gentlmen would not &s;ell their lands, to become banckrout Marchants, nor Marchants liue in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of youth-be guiled gentlemen: who ca&s;t them&s;elues out of their parents heritages for a few out-ca&s;t commodities. But wit whither wilt thou? What hath Morrice tripping Will to do with that? it keeps not time w^t his dance: therefore roome you morral precepts, giue my legs leaue to ende my Morrice, or that being ended, my hands leaue to perfect this worthle&s;&s;e poore tottered volume.</P>
<P>Pardon me Madame, that I am thus tedious, I cannot chu&s;e but co~mend &s;acred liberality, which
<PB REF="14"> makes poore wretches partakers of all comfortable benefits, be&s;ides the loue &amp; fauour already repeated: M.

<P>It re&s;teth how that in a word I &s;hew, what pro|fit I haue made by my Morrice: true it is I put out &s;ome money to haue threefold gaine at my returne, &s;ome that loue me, regard my paines, &amp; re&s;pect their promi&s;e, haue &s;ent home the treble worth, &s;ome other at the fir&s;t &s;ight haue paide me, if I came to &s;eek the~, others I cannot &s;ee, nor wil they willingly be &s;ound, and the&s;e are the greater number.

<P>MY notable Shabetags, the effect of my &s;ure is di&s;couered in the Title of my &s;upplication. But for your better vnder&s;tandings: for that I know you to be a &s;ort of witles beetle hends, that can vnder&s;tand nothing, but what is knocke into your &s;calpes. The&s;e are by the&s;e pre&s;entes to certifie vnto your block head&s;hips, that I William Kemp, whom you had neer hand rent in &s;under with your vnrea&s;onable times, am &s;hortly God willing to &s;et forward as merily as I may; whether I my &s;elfe know not Wherefore by the way I would wi&s;h ye, imploy not your little wits in certifying the world that I am gone to Rome, Ieru&s;alem, Venice, or any other place at your idle appoint. I knowe the be&s;t of ye by the lyes ye writ of me, got not the price of a good hat to couer your brainles heads: If any of ye had come to me, my bounty &s;hould haue exceeded the be&s;t of your good ma&s;ters the Ballad-buiers, I wold haue apparrelled your dry pates in party coloured bonnets, &amp; be&s;towd a lea&s;h of my ca&s;t belles to haue crown'd ye with cox-combs. I haue made a priuie &s;earch, what priuate Iigmonger of your iolly num|ber,
<PB REF="16"> hath been the Author of the&s;e abhominable bal|lets written of me: I was told it was the great bal|let-maker <HI>T.D. alias Tho. Deloney,</HI> Chronicler of the memorable liues of the <HI>6.</HI> yeomen of the we&s;t, Iack of Newbery, the Gentle-craft, &amp; &s;uch like hone&s;t me~: omitted by Stow, Hollin&s;head, Grafto~, Hal, froy&s;art, &amp; the re&s;t of tho&s;e wel de&s;eruing writers: but I was giuen &s;ince to vnder&s;tand, your late generall Tho. dyed poorely, as ye all mu&s;t do, and was hone&s;tly bu|ried: which is much to bee doubted of &s;ome of you. The que&s;t of inquiry finding him by death acquited of the Inditement, I was let to wit, y^t another Lord of litle wit, one who&s;e imployment for the Pageant, was vtterly &s;pent, he being knowne to be Eldertons immediate heyre, was vehemently &s;u&s;pected but af|ter due inqui&s;ition was made, he was at that time knowne to liue like a man in a mi&s;t, hauing quite gi|uen ouer the mi&s;tery. Still the &s;earch continuing, I met a proper vpright youth, onely for a little &s;tooping in the &s;houlders: all hart to the heele, a penny Poet who&s;e fir&s;t making was the mi&s;erable &s;tolne &s;tory of Macdoel, or Macdobeth, or Mac&s;omewhat: for I am &s;ure a Mac it was, though I neuer had the maw to &s;ee it: &amp; hee tolde me there was a fat filthy ballet-maker, that &s;hould haue once been his Iourneyman to the trade: who liu'd about the towne: and ten to one, but he had thus terribly abu&s;ed me &amp; my Tabe|rer: for that he was able to do &s;uch a thing in print. A &s;hrewd pre&s;umption: I found him about the bank&s;ide, &s;itting at a play, I de&s;ired to &s;peake with him,
<PB REF="16"> had him to a Tauerne, charg'd a pipe with Tobacco, and then laid this terrible accu&s;ation to his charge. He &s;wels pre&s;ently like one of the foure windes, the violence of his breath, blew the Tobacco out of the pipe, &amp; the heate of his wrath drunke dry two bowle|fuls of Rheni&s;h wine. At length hauing power to &s;peake. Name my accu&s;er &s;aith he, or I defye thee Kemp at the quart &s;taffe. I told him, &amp; all his anger turned to laughter: &s;wearing it did him good to haue ill words of a hoddy doddy, a habber de hoy, a chicken, a &s;quib, a &s;quall: One that hath not wit e|nough to make a ballet, that by <HI>Pol</HI> and <HI>Aedipol,</HI> would Pol his father, Derick his dad: doe anie thing how ill &s;oeuer, to plea&s;e his api&s;h humor. I hardly beleeued, this youth that I tooke to be gra|cious, had bin &s;o graceles: but I heard afterwards his mother in law was eye and eare witnes of his fathers abu&s;e by this ble&s;&s;ed childe on a publique &s;tage, in a merry Hoa&s;t of an Innes part. Yet all this while could not I finde out the true bal|let-maker. Till by chaunce a friend of mine puld out of his pocket a booke in Latine called <HI>Mun|dus Furio&s;us:</HI> printed at <HI>Cullen,</HI> written by one of the vilde&s;t and arrante&s;t lying Cullians that euer writ booke, his name Ian&s;onius, who ta|king vpon him to write an ab&s;tract of all the tur|bulent actions that had beene lately attempted or performed in Chri&s;tendome, like an vnchri&s;tian wretch, writes onely by report, partially, and
<PB REF="17"> &s;coffingly, of &s;uch who&s;e pages &s;hooes hee was vn|worthy to wipe, for indeed he is now dead: farewell he, euery dog mu&s;t haue a day. But &s;ee the luck on't: this beggerly lying bu&s;ie-bodies name, brought out the Ballad-maker: and it was generally confirmd, it was his kin&s;man: he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elfe guilty, let any man looke on his face: if there be not &s;o redde a colour that all the &s;ope in the towne will not wa&s;he white, let me be turned to a Whiting as I pa&s;&s;e be|tweene Douer and Callis. Well, God forgiue thee hone&s;t fellow, I &s;ee thou ha&s;t grace in thee: I pre|thee do &s;o no more, leaue writing the&s;e bea&s;tly bal|lets, make not good wenches Prophete&s;&s;es, for litle or no profit, nor for a &s;ixe-penny matter, reuiue not a poore fellowes fault thats hanged for his offence: it may be thy owne de&s;tiny one day, prethee be good to them. Call vp thy olde Melpomene, who&s;e &s;traube|ry quill may write the bloody lines of the blew La|dy, and the Prince of the burning crowne: a better &s;ubiect I can tell ye: than your Knight of the Red Cro&s;&s;e. So farewel, and cro&s;&s;e me no more I prethee with thy rabble of bald rimes, lea&s;t at my re|turne I &s;et a cro&s;&s;e on thy forehead, that all men may know thee for a foole.</P>
