<P>The <HI>30.</HI> of September the Spaniards tooke in Lam&s;heym, our Hor&s;men are all gone to their quar|ters at Seckenheym, Neckerhau&s;en, and Edingen, they di&s;tru&s;t to be able to re&s;i&s;t the Spani&s;h forces, they are not &s;trong enough both on Foot and Hor&s;e|men. To day a <HI>1000.</HI> Soldiers are trayned at Nec|kerhau&s;en, The Spaniards keepe them&s;elues at Franckendal, it is thought that they will march to New&s;tat.</P>
<P>The <HI>30.</HI> of September, &s;he hor&s;emen of Ouer|trout, haue ran&s;acked the &s;uburbes of Weinheim, they will likewi&s;e ran&s;acke the Towne it &s;elfe, be|cau&s;e that they haue y&eacute;elded them&s;elues to the Spaniards.</P>
<P>At Heydelburgh they make before Newenheym a land partition, and a Bulwarke, whereupon great pieces of Ordenance may be planted. On the other &s;ide they haue taken downe the tower called Trots Key&s;er, and filled it with earth, and p&eacute;eces of Canon &s;hall be &s;et vpon it.</P>

<P>Thr&eacute;e dayes pa&s;t, tho&s;e of Gulicke being <HI>7000.</HI> men &s;trong, &s;allyed out with <HI>Thomas Viller</HI> his hor&s;|men, &amp; tooke in a Sconce by Lint&s;enich on this &s;ide of the Roer, wherein &s;ome of the Spani&s;h &s;ouldiers were &s;laine, and &s;o with their Lieutenant were ta|ken pri&s;oners and brought into Gulicke, who the next day were all relea&s;ed againe, the &s;aid Leiute|nant remaining &s;urety for their ran&s;ome.</P>
<P>The&s;e of Gulick haue made a Sconce on the Ro|erbridge, through which they can fall out, they haue al&s;o the&s;e dayes pa&s;t &s;hot furiou&s;ly out of it, to hin|der the Spaniards from making their fortifications, whereouer &s;ome were killed. In the meane time the gates of Gulick &s;tand yet open, and the Cattle goeth yet out to pa&s;ture, and the women and Children of the Soldiers in Gulick, are yet &s;uffered to come in the towne, And thus the Towne and fortre&s;&s;es is yet well prouided of all nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>From <HI>France</HI> is the Death of Duke of Mayne confirmed, being be&s;ides him many Noble and Gen|tlemen &s;laine, with &s;ome odde hundreths of &s;oldiers. And moreouer the contagious di&s;ea&s;e is great in the Kings leager, if h&eacute;e will their continue it is much doubted of. It is likewi&s;e reported that the Duke of Rohan is n&eacute;ere, with &s;ome thou&s;ands of men rea|dy and n&eacute;ere to rel&eacute;eue the &s;iege from Montaubon.</P>
<P>The Duke of Rohan hath with him <HI>20000.</HI> men, and hath &s;ent word to the King, that he will not come to any agr&eacute;ement, before all the affaires of France be fir&s;t pacified, and by fault thereof, that he will re&s;i&s;t him to the vttermo&s;t, although he &s;hould be forced to auoyde the Kingdome.</P>
<P>We heare from <HI>Rees,</HI> that they worke yet hard on the new Forts ouer the Rhine, that right ouer the Town of Emmerick another Fort &s;hould he made, otherwi&s;e no mutation of things was done, nor al&s;o of the Spani&s;h &s;ide, it &s;&eacute;emeth that by rea&s;on of the long raining weather at this time, no further enter|pri&s;es &s;hall be vnder taken.</P>
