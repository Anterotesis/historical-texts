<HEAD>THE CHARGE OF THE Admirals of England.</HEAD>
<P>Licen&s;ed according to Order.</P>
<P>AS <HI>England</HI> is Wall'd round with a Wall of Water, Her De|fence of that Wall by Her Floating Ca&s;tles, Her Naval Strength and Management, is her greate&s;t, if not almo&s;t Her only Bulwarks and Rampants. This is mo&s;t certain, as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire holds a two-fold <HI>Regale,</HI> Her <HI>Scepter,</HI> and Her <HI>Trident;</HI> Her Dominion at Land, and Her Soveraignty at Sea; &s;o, that Maritine Principality being the <HI>Frontiers</HI> and <HI>Out-lines</HI> of Her whole Power and Territories, and con&s;equently Her chiefe&s;t Strength, as being Her only Inlet; that Deputed Hand, that under the Imperial Commi&s;&s;ion, has the <HI>Charge</HI> of Her <HI>Admiralty,</HI> has the highe&s;t Po&s;t of Honour, and the mo&s;t Impor|tant Tru&s;t that a Crown'd Head can lodge in a Subject. For, as no At|taque can be made upon <HI>England,</HI> without fir&s;t gaining Her <HI>Ma&s;tery</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> the Pre&s;ervation of that faire&s;t of Her Crown-Jewels is, and ought to be Her able&s;t Care and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>This is notoriou&s;ly manife&s;t from the never-dying Fame of our Great <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where one intire Naval Triumph o're <HI>Spain,</HI> was of more Advantage to this Kingdom, and carried more Trophies along with it, than all the Battles and Succe&s;&s;es of a <HI>Third Edward,</HI> or a <HI>Fifth Henry,</HI> in the very Bowels of <HI>France.</HI> For, to &s;umm the whole Grandeur of that Greate&s;t of Potentates, and be&s;t of Queens; Her Sword-work at Land, tho' encompa&s;&s;ed with Enemies, was nothing to Her Thunder-work at <HI>Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The Fortune of that &s;ingle Stroke, attended with &s;o great a Blow upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and Her prudent Caution of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Maritine Growth of <HI>France,</HI> even again&s;t their great <HI>Fourth Henry</HI> him&s;elf, in threatning to burn his Navy in their Harbour for &s;o much as attempting to build a Capital <HI>Ship of War,</HI> was of that high Import to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grandeur; that had Her Politicks been pur&s;ued, and Her Advantages from that onely Succe&s;s been rightly improved by Her Ma&s;culine, tho' (Heavens knows) more Effeminate Succe&s;&s;ors; <HI>England</HI> had held the Scale of <HI>Europe</HI> to
<PB REF="2">End of the World, and the pre&s;ent Greatne&s;s of <HI>France,</HI> the now Terror of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> had been wholly an impracticable Attempt and Ambition.</P>
<P>But as the afore&s;aid E&s;teminacy of the &s;ucceeding Reigns, utterly ne|glected that fortunate Occa&s;ion, and lo&s;t the happy <HI>Forelock;</HI> which had we held, we had awed the whole World, and pre&s;erved the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Greatne&s;s, as immortal, as that <HI>Prince&s;&s;es</HI> never-dying Memory, and has thereby &s;o infinitely le&s;&s;ened our Original <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Lu&s;tre: Neverthele&s;s, 'tis not &s;o late, even after all our Lo&s;&s;es, and former Mi&s;-managements, to en|deavour &s;ome part at lea&s;t of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Recovery. This Glory at lea&s;t we have to boa&s;t, for our Encouragement, That never more hardy Cou|rage &s;ate on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne than now. Nor a <HI>Prince,</HI> who&s;e Endea|vours and Zeal can be more &s;trenuous, or more indefatigable, for the Redemption of our too long falling Glory. Cou'd all Hands follow; but as this leads, both Fear and De&s;pair would be far from our Doors, and a new Dawn of Hopes &s;urronnd us.</P>
<P>But to return to our <HI>Admiral</HI>'s Cau&s;e: As the <HI>Sea</HI> is a <HI>Divi&s;um Im|perium,</HI> a &s;eparate Soveraignty from that of the <HI>Land;</HI> and accordingly the Laws; by which all Maritine Affairs are tried, are different from the common Law of the Nation; So the <HI>Lord High Admiral</HI> of <HI>England</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion, as &s;o much different from any other Command, con&s;titutes him no le&s;s than a <HI>Viceroy;</HI> a Title above any other Dignity, or Prefer|ment whatever.</P>
<P>If the Honour of the Command it &s;elf be &s;o Eminent and Illu&s;trious, the Faithful and Zealous Execution of it mu&s;t be truly more Honourable and Illu&s;trious; for indeed 'tis only the Di&s;charge of a Tru&s;t, and the Exertion of Virtuous Actions, and Gallant Atchievements, are the true Foundati|on of Renown and Glory.</P>
<P>As the ever-memorable <HI>Drake</HI> has left a Name that will live as long Time it &s;elf &s;hall la&s;t; we may likewi&s;e add, That our latter Honourable Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> has acquired as large a &s;hare of Fame, as true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Courage, rewarded with Succe&s;s and Victory, can well reach. And 'tis highly to be wi&s;h'd, that our this pre&s;ent Years latter Expedition, in our <HI>Joynt Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiralty,</HI> cou'd have met with as fair a Chapplet of Lawrels. But if either any un&s;miling Providences above, or unhappier Conduct below, have deny'd us that Ble&s;&s;ing; 'tis our Misfortune, that &s;o fair a Chian &s;hould ever be broken, and that &s;uch Signal Happine&s;&s;es &s;hould be other than the continued &s;how'ring Favours of our kind Stars.</P>
<P>But whether our this Years Unhappine&s;s at <HI>Sea</HI> was <HI>Misfortune,</HI> or <HI>Mi&s;-management,</HI> is a Province above me; 'tis &s;afficient, that <HI>Sub Judice lis e&s;t.</HI> The Cau&s;e is depending before the Great Council of the Land, Our Patriots in <HI>Parliament</HI> A&s;&s;embled, who&s;e Vigilance and Wi&s;dom, as they have the In&s;pection now before them; &s;o their Hands have the Bal|lance, and Scales, to do Ju&s;tice accordingly.</P>
