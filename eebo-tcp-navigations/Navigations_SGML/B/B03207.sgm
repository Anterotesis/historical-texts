On <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t, the 25 in&s;tant, 1699. here Arrived an Expre&s;s to the <HI>Court of Directors</HI> of the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Company, from the Council of their Collony in <HI>America,</HI> bearing date at <HI>New Edinburgh,</HI> in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> the 28. of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, which brings the Welcome News of their being Arrived &s;ave at <HI>Darien</HI> the 2. of <HI>November:</HI> That the Natives came immediatly on Board of them, with all Imaginable Demon&s;trations of Joy, at their Arrival, inviting them a Shoar to &s;ettle and inhabite among&s;t them, and that they &s;hould meet with a Kind and Welcome Reception: That on the 3d. they &s;ounded the Coa&s;t and Bay, and on the 4th. brought their Ships within the Harbour, and begun to Land their Men: That in a very &s;hort time, the Chiefs, or Captains, of the &s;everal Tribes, were &s;o very fond of their Treatment, that they offered not only a Right to what was Uninhabited in their &s;everal Bounds, but al&s;o to Re&s;ign even their own particular Plantations: And that before the &s;aid Expre&s;s came away, they had, with all the Solemni|ty and Ceremony Requi&s;ite, taken Commi&s;&s;ions from the &s;aid Council, and do actually carry the Company's Colours in their <HI>Canoas,</HI> or little Boats: That, that part of <HI>Darien</HI> where they are &s;ettled, (now called <HI>Caledonia</HI>) was never before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any <HI>Europian</HI> Nation: That the Climate is as Healthy there, as any upon the Continent of <HI>America;</HI> And they are &s;o far from meeting with any of tho&s;e Contagious Di&s;tempers, Epidemick to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and other <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, that all the Men who were &s;ick upon the Voyage, have, &s;ince their Arrival there, Recovered to perfect Health even beyond Expecta|tion, Excepting a Few who dyed before Landing, or very &s;oon thereafter; So that the &s;aid Expre&s;s left not a Sick Man a Shoar but Five, who were on a very hopfull way of Recovery: That the Soil is Extream Rich and Fertile, and when duely Cultivated, will (no doubt) produce any thing that's valu|able in <HI>America:</HI> That the Country is Extreamly well watered with excel|lent Springs, and Rivers of choice Whol&s;ome Water: That they have a very Commodious and Excellent Harbour, and that as yet their whole time was be&s;tow'd and all hands at Work, in Building of Forts and Hou&s;es.</P>
