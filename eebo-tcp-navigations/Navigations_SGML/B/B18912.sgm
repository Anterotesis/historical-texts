<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THat this <HI>Epi|tome</HI> &s;hould &s;uit with the Grain of all Mens Di&s;po&s;itions, is far beyond my expectation; becau&s;e I am &s;ufficiently &s;en|&s;ible that Mens mindes are as di&s;crepant, as their Phy|&s;iognomies are various: And it hath been the fate of all
<PB REF="3">Writers that ever appeared in publique, (e&s;pecially un|der the notion of Saty|ri&s;ts) to be attended by &s;ome carping <HI>Zoilus:</HI> But fall back fall edge, I will be ar|med with a &s;ufficient &s;tock of Patience to undergo the Succe&s;s of this Publication. I know already, that if &s;ome carping Critick light on it, he will ca&s;t it a&s;ide, and &s;ay, the&s;e Whim&s;ies are but <HI>In|genii la&s;civientis flo&s;culi,</HI> the &s;uperfluous Excre&s;cen|cies of la&s;civiating wit. Or probably &s;ome Squeami&s;h Zealot, who through Hy|pocondraick Melancholy, is
<PB REF="3">become a meer Lump of quickened Care, may di&s;|gu&s;t it; yet the more frol|licki&s;h Genius, who no doubt is freer from intended mi&s;|chief then the thoughtful man, will di&s;ge&s;t it.</P>
<P>Let not the &s;mallne&s;s of the bulk occa&s;ion your con|tempt; for the more vigo|rous a thing is, the narrow|er is the circumference that contains it. And it is u&s;u|ally &s;aid, <HI>The &s;maller the Vo|lume, the fewer the faults:</HI> Some there are undoubted|ly, which have either e&s;ca|ped the Printer, or el&s;e were occa&s;ioned by my own neg|lect;
<PB REF="4">but my Sanctuary is the hope of your accu&s;tom|ed Candor and Clemency, which may &s;hrowd me from any fal&s;e imputation: How|ever, here you have it as it is; and as a man takes his wife, &s;o mu&s;t you take this Piece, for better for wor&s;e&punc; Here you have my Cru&s;e of Oyl, as well as my Bottle of Vineger; &s;ome &s;weet &s;mel|ling Flowers, as well as bit|ter Wormwood: Nor was it my intention in publi&s;h|ing this Pamphlet to be|&s;patter any &s;ingle per&s;on; but, like a Fencer in a pub|lick Show, wave my Sword
<PB REF="4">about, aim at all, and hit none; yet the mildene&s;s of the Conclu&s;ion will miti|gate the &s;everity of the Ex|ordium: And the mo&s;t na|tural Italian will be com|pelled to confe&s;s that I end well, though I began ill, and will vouch&s;afe to give his <HI>Plaudite</HI> to the Epilogue, though the Prologue di&s;|plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>Now there is none of the Readers &s;o illiterate, I pre|&s;ume, as to be ignorant of that as true, as ancient Sen|tence, <HI>Finis coronat Opus;</HI> which I have taught to &s;peak Engli&s;h thus:</P>

<P>For that hath two ends, and &s;o have I, as well as two parts; the one Vituperato|ry, and the other Laudato|ry.</P>
<P>Reader, peru&s;e it, if thy more weighty Affaires will permit, it is but &s;mall, and &s;o will put thee to no great Expence either of Money or Time, and if thou gain|e&s;t any benefit by the &s;ur|veighing of it, it will not repent thee of thy peru&s;al.

<P>And fir&s;t let us con&s;ider <HI>Rome,</HI> that reputed Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World, and Metropolis of <HI>Italy,</HI> who&s;e Encomiums hath devour|ed more reams of Paper, and drunk up more bottles of Ink, than would repair a decay'd Sta|tioner, and we &s;hall find her to be according to their own Proverb:

<P>'Tis a market, where Sins and Pardons are &s;aleable, nay Staple|commodities. A Juglers Shop, who&s;e Ma&s;ter plays finely at fa&s;t and loo&s;e with Oaths and Vows. A Mill, where the blind and ig|norant Laity grind for the fat Clergy. A Magazine where more Scripture is &s;tored, than ever their Maker in&s;pired. A Church that depraves the Text, and pins their Faith upon other mens &s;leeves. A Slaughter-hou&s;e, where the Butchers bring in all &s;orts of per&s;ons, and now and then a Monarch. A woman that hath been a Whore all her youth, and now is turn'd bawd to Sin. In

<P>This City that is founded up|on &s;even hills, is the re&s;idence of of that &s;even headed <HI>Hydra,</HI> the Pope, and here he doth tyrannize over his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Va&s;&s;als, far more than ever <HI>Nero</HI> or <HI>Caligula.</HI> He mu&s;t not pa&s;s without a Saty|rick nip, and now I think on't, I could wi&s;h my pen were dipt in Lye and Gall, that I might la&s;h him &s;ufficiently: He it is, yet cau&s;eth what&s;oever he parrot (or if you will have it Anagramma|tically) praterlike twattles, to pa&s;s for Bullion, and current, though hammer'd in the impure mint of his own Chymaerical Pericranium, and &s;peaks freely what&s;oever he thinks without
<PB N="11" REF="11">contradictions, &s;o that his <HI>Ip&s;e dixit</HI> will countervail, and over|balance all the <HI>Ergo's</HI> in the World: His tongue is confited in Pepper, and hath pierc'd the &s;ides of Chri&s;tendome more &s;hrewdly than ever <HI>Mahomets</HI> Sword did: He it is, with his Complices, that maintain Error to get them a maintenance; He dethrones the Deity, and deifies wood and &s;tone; yet he is there <HI>Deus in Terris,</HI> The Dagon which they have &s;et up; the Idol which they adore, who&s;e indul|gences make his Kitehin &s;moke, by the help of his coadjutars the Je&s;uites, that fetch him fuel from mo&s;t parts in Chri&s;tendom. There is no &s;uch Pick-pur&s;e under the Heavens as his fictitious Purga|tory; and could mens con&s;cien|ces be as throughly purged as
<PB N="12" REF="12">their pur&s;es, they would excel the Angels them&s;elves in purity.

Not a day pa&s;&s;eth, but they extract fre&s;h Silver (rare Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Chy|mi&s;ts) from the hot furnace of their Purgatory: And when they find that [Silver] <HI>Luna</HI> &s;hines up|on

Ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints! that di&s;approve of lawful matri|mony, but approve of unlawful meretricious actions: it grieves them to &s;ee &s;uch pure Nunnes fle&s;h, as they do &s;omtimes, bar|reld up in penitential pickle, yet for all the pretended &s;trict|ne&s;s of their Religion, they can break a Lent to &s;eed upon them.</P>
<P>Twelfth, He would often ride abroad in the Coach with <HI>Juana Maria</HI> a Lady of plea&s;ure, that was as common as a Barbers Chair, no &s;ooner one was out, but another was in.</P>

<P>Twentieth, He did innumer|able other acts of ob&s;cenity and wantonne&s;s, as inviting the fair|e&s;t Concubines into his garden, where he had provided as &s;ump|tuous as lu&s;cious a Banquet for them, after which he command|ed them to &s;trip them&s;elves &s;tark naked (where 'tis to be ob&s;erved he had a fancy to &s;ee the naked truth) whil'&s;t he with a hollow trunck, &s;het confits at their na|ked bodies, which they were to take up &s;tanding upon their high Chiappins.</P>

<PB N="31" REF="21">their indigency: One will &s;it at his door picking his teeth, and condemning the Capon he eat la&s;t, when alas poor de&s;picable wretch!

Another will beg in this method: Fir&s;t he looks to &s;ee whether the coa&s;t be clear, before he will utter one Suppliant &s;yl|lable, and then he approaches with &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ivene&s;s, as a &s;lave u&s;eth to his Patron; yet if any chance to glance that way with his eye, immediately he re|treats to familiarity, pre&s;&s;ing the ju&s;tne&s;s of his demands, till he

But now I think we have breath'd the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Cour&s;er &s;uffici|ently, let us turn our Bridle, and travel to <HI>Venice;</HI> which is taken to be no other then a Boat, that &s;ome Ca&s;tle doth embarque by the Magick Laws of <HI>Urgandus,</HI> when he would have &s;ayled to great <HI>Albion</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Amadis,</HI> as he did in times of the year: and 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the world never produced &s;uch unheard of <HI>Machiavilian</HI> Devices to &s;ur|prize an Enemy unawares, as the

<P>A fourth is a Gun, to be di&s;|charged with wind, which for &s;ix paces fails not of execution, with little or no report. And give me leave to adde a fifth Knack of theirs, which is their <HI>Bergama&s;que</HI> hanging up in the third Chamber of the Grand Dogues Gallery; being an Invention to lock up female frailty; an irrefragable Argument of the Italian Jealou|&s;ie, with which inhumane con|&s;traint they do &s;o per&s;ecute and pro&s;ecute their Con&s;orts back and belly, and &s;o cramp them hip and thigh, that if a poor de&s;pica|ble Crab-lou&s;e &s;hould chance to be cloy&s;ter'd up within the&s;e fer|raments, he hath not room to
<PB N="35" REF="23">breath, and what would become of the poor Flea &s;hould it be his fate to be thus confined? I pre|&s;ume he could not take his frol|liki&s;h Lavaltors.

Another being demanded by one of our Clergy men in <HI>England,</HI> how many Sacraments there were? replied, Nine: at which he being amazed, he asked him how he could prove it: to which he rejoyn'd, &s;even beyond &s;ea, and two with you: at which the Bi&s;hop &s;miling, though pity|ing his ignorance, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him. One more in&s;tance I have for you, and then I have done: A certain Prie&s;t among them com|ing often to vi&s;it a Merchant, one of his Pari&s;hioners, becau&s;e he was one of his noble&s;t Benefact|ors, was &s;o much taken with his Wife, that for the future he re|&s;olved to a&s;&s;ociate him&s;elf with the Mi&s;tre&s;s, and not the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, which accordingly
<PB N="77" REF="44">he did, and &s;ollicited her ince&s;|&s;antly for a nights lodging (&s;ee what it is to be troubled with the Pr&mdash; of zeal) but &s;he like a cha&s;te Matron, &s;corning to be di&s;loyal to her husband, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">f <HI>Lam|berts</HI> Lady had been &s;o loyal, <HI>Nol</HI> had ne're made him wear the Bulls Feather) and withal &s;he did inculcate, and repeat the &s;candal that it was to tho&s;e of his Coat, to entertain &s;o much as a thought of coveting his neighbors wife; but he a &s;ervant to the fle&s;h more then to the &s;pirit, grew the more earne&s;t for being repuls'd, and renewed his intreaties and per|&s;wa&s;ions with more vigor, then formerly: She perceiving it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid it, unle&s;s it were by di&s;covering him, re&s;olv'd to do it when her husband came home; which accordingly &s;he did,
<PB N="78" REF="45">who after he under&s;tood his de|&s;ign, bid her promi&s;e him the u&s;e of her body, and he would be in the next room ready to enter in the very heighth of opportunity, and &s;poil his &s;port; &s;o the next time he came, he per&s;i&s;ted &s;till in his accu&s;tomed humor, and &s;he at la&s;t with a kinde of unwilling willingne&s;s, &s;eemed to be over|come with his per&s;wa&s;ions, and &s;o con&s;ented to let him have the fruition of his de&s;ire, which he over-joyed to hear, made all po&s;|&s;ible &s;peed to the Bed-chamber, where in the twinkling of a Bed|&s;taff, he di&s;rob'd him&s;elf of his Pontificalibus, and was ju&s;t skip|ping into bed, when her husband rattled at the door, which &s;he hearing, bid him get into the Pre&s;s that &s;tood by the Bed &s;ide, to hide him&s;elf; which he did in
<PB N="79" REF="45">all ha&s;te, glad at his heart that he was cloy&s;ter'd within tho&s;e woodden walls from the &s;ight of the Goodman of the hou&s;e, who coming in in the interim, taking no notice at all of the bu&s;tle he made with tumbling into the Pre&s;s; How do&s;t thou, my dear? &s;aith he, Prethee what's the rea|&s;on that this Pre&s;s is always left open? and &s;o lockt it, and put the Key in his Pocket: Now you mu&s;t note by the way, that this fell out to be on Saturday night, as fortune would have it, and the Prie&s;t, next morning be|ing Sunday, was to officiate in the Pulpit; the day began at the length to appear, and the time draw nigh wherein people u&s;ually frequent the Temple, there all &s;ervice was perform'd, the Saints|bell rung, and the people gaping
<PB N="80" REF="46">in expectation of the Prie&s;t, who as yet was cabinetted up in the Merchants hou&s;e, who had a de|&s;ign upon him to make him a publick example of infamy to the people, and ignominious and hateful to the Clergy, at lea&s;t in appearance and outward &s;hew, (though they can pa&s;s by &s;uch tricks of youth without exami|nation or puni&s;hment) which was this, he cau&s;ed the Pre&s;s to be carried into the Church, and pla|ced behinde the Pulpit, at which &s;udden and unexpected &s;ight the Congregation was amazed, and immediately gave order that the Pre&s;s door &s;hould be opened; which was no &s;ooner done, but the Prie&s;t like a gho&s;t newly come from among the tombs, &s;teps into the Pulpit with the&s;e words in his mouth, <HI>Sic re&s;urrexit</HI> Laza|rus
<PB N="81" REF="46"><HI>&egrave; &s;epulchro:</HI> In this po&s;ture did <HI>Lazarus</HI> ari&s;e out of the grave, and preacht upon't as his Text; for which his religious zeal, he was highly extoll'd by the people (they being altogether ig|norant of his lu&s;ty zeal that fir&s;t cau&s;ed his confinement) and the Merchant perceiving how inge|niou&s;ly he had cloaked this his piece of knavery, did not divulge it at that pre&s;ent, but kept it within his own brea&s;ts: But we mu&s;t not &s;cratch the pates of the&s;e bald Prie&s;ts too much, le&s;t we draw blood: now to the Ca|noni&s;t. The Canon-Law that hath &s;o great a vogue in <HI>Italy,</HI> will &s;ooner be condemn'd for vicious, then extoll'd for ju&s;t, when you con&s;ider that it makes the Crown do homage to the Mitre; the Scepter to the Cro&s;ier, and the

<P>Among the Italians he is ac|counted no le&s;s then a fool, that is not melancholy once a day: They are onely liberal to their Superiors, from whom they ex|pect greater benefits; to all others the pur&s;e is clo&s;e&s;t &s;hut, when the mouth opens wide&s;t: nor is there any probability of your get|ting a piece of Cake there, unle&s;s yours be known to be in the Oven. To add to their trea&s;ure, they will light a candle to the Devil. In <HI>Legorn</HI> they allow a Jews Synagogue; nay, you may be what Devil you will there, &s;o you pu&s;h not the Pope with your horn. They are the greate&s;t em|bracers of plea&s;ure, and e&s;teem of pearles as pebles, &s;o they can but &s;atiate their <HI>Gu&s;to,</HI> in point
<PB N="83" REF="47">of plea&s;ure, Here you may finde Love and Hatred, Virtue and Vice, Super&s;tition, and Religion in their extreams, for the great|e&s;t wits once depraved prove ever the mo&s;t dangerous. They are in their Lu&s;ts unnatural, in their hatred irreconciliable, and in their thoughts unfathomable, &s;o that with one breath they blow both hot, and cold, and to com|pa&s;s their own ends, and accom|pli&s;h their own de&s;ignes, they will play the Divel incarnat: But now we will wring them no more by the no&s;e, le&s;t we fetch blood, wherefore we will allay the bit|terne&s;s of this potion with the edulcorating ingredients of their virtues.</P>

<P>Nor are her Cities le&s;s famous then her inhabitants: and fir&s;t of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is judged the Em|pere&s;s of the world, the Protect|ere&s;s of all Arts and Sciences, and the Fountaine from who&s;e &s;treams of Virtue and Piety, the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian world is wa|tred.

<PB N="88" REF="50"><HI>Martial</HI> the Epigrammati&s;t &s;ings, as her due Encomium.
<Q><HI>Terrarum Dea, Gentium&abque; Roma Cui par e&s;t nihil, &amp; nihil &s;ecun|dum.</HI></Q> What a va&s;t Circumference &s;he had, may be gue&s;&s;ed at by the number of Cobwebs that <HI>Helio|gabalus</HI> cau&s;ed to be gathered there, which amounted to a thou|&s;and weight.</P>
<P>As for the renown'd Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> without her, as an eminent Author of our times notes, <HI>Italy</HI> &s;hould want her chiefe&s;t Ornament, Liberty a re|fuge, <HI>Europe</HI> her Bulwark, <HI>Nep|tune</HI> &s;hould be de&s;titute of a Mi&s;tris, and Nature of a Miracle. She is a Lady that hath encroacht more upon <HI>Neptunes</HI> dominions, then any State in the World: She commands a fortre&s;s that is
<PB N="89" REF="50">built according to the mo&s;t ex|act rules of Enginery, that &s;tood her in two millions the erecting, and charges her with a hundred thou&s;and Crowns <HI>per annum,</HI> her yearly maintenance. Her Ar&s;e|nal is as famous a wonder as her illu&s;trious &s;elf, &s;he would exta&s;y a foreiner with the &s;ight of her &s;tately fabricks. This City, &s;aith one of our well-worded Gran|dees, that is adorn'd with a dou|ble portion of Parts, and Arts, Manners, and Manors, hath con|tinued a Virgin nere upon the&s;e fifteen hundred years, yet withal &s;uch an Amazon, that &s;he hath wre&s;tled with the mo&s;t potent Monarchs in <HI>Europe,</HI> and thrown &s;ome of them flat on their backs, but none of them could lay her in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as to get her Mayden-head. Her grandees are
<PB N="90" REF="51">noble Patriots, <HI>Patres Patriae,</HI> they have publique &s;pirits, are fage in Councels, and &s;olid in their judgement, con&s;tant in ad|ver&s;e, and moderate in good for|tune: Nor doth her incolumity depend upon the &s;lender twi&s;t of the life of one &s;ingle per&s;on, but upon the prudent management of an immortal Senate.</P>
<P>The Characters that the Lear|ned confer upon her are many, noble, and what &s;he de&s;erves in their own judgement. <HI>Mamerti|nus</HI> the Panegyri&s;t, calls her <HI>Gen|tium Dominam,</HI> the Mi&s;tre&s;s of all Nations. <HI>Rutilius Numatia|nus, Coele&s;tem mundique Reginam;</HI> A Heavenly thing, and Empre&s;s of the world. <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicar|na&s;&s;aeus, Totius Orbis optimam:</HI> The mo&s;t famous Countrey in the who&s;e univer&s;e. And others,
<PB N="91" REF="51"><HI>Caput Orbis,</HI> The Head of the world, and that not unde&s;erved|ly, for either Pike or Pen, <HI>Mer|cury</HI> or <HI>Mars;</HI> no Nation what|&s;oever that comes into the ba|lance with her, but will be out|poiz'd, if held up by an unbya&s;&s;ed hand.</P>
<P>Touching her Exce&s;&s;es, and principally tho&s;e of the Popes, which have been &s;ufficiently ana|tomized by &s;everal Authors, it is incontrovertible; that among &s;o great a number &s;ome will be found culpable: There is no Wheat, but &s;ome Chaff; no Wine but &s;ome Lees. In the fir&s;t Ele|ction that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour made, among twelve there was one found bad: But let it not be buried in oblivion, that the fir&s;t thirty three Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;uf|fered Martyrdom: And if that
<PB N="92" REF="52">the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks Purple &s;eem to dazzle the eyes of &s;ome weak|&s;ighted, and &s;lenderly-grounded per&s;ons, and that the Clergy &s;eem to them to lead a life in too much external pomp and out|ward glory, the Capuchians frock and the reclu&s;e and au&s;tere lives of Mendicant Fryars, and other ab&s;tenious per&s;ons, may &s;erve in lieu of an Apology for the pre|mentioned Extravagancies.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> be cramm'd with Courtizano's, yet the cha&s;tity of &s;o many thou&s;ands of pious cloy&s;ter'd &s;ouls, who have totally wean'd them&s;elves from all mundane frothy delights, and adhered to heaven, and the hopes they have of the fruition thereof, may make &s;ome &s;atisfaction for their Exce&s;&s;es.

<PB N="93" REF="52">that de&s;erves con&s;iderati|on, and that is, <HI>Non minus mag|nam virtutem e&s;&s;e &s;cire de&s;inere, quam &s;cire dicere.</HI> It is no le&s;s vertue to know when to put a period to a Di&s;cour&s;e, then to write the Exordium; wherefore I judge it far better to &s;trike &s;ayl, then to launch any farther into &s;o va&s;t an Ocean of Matter, as the Prai&s;e of the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">alians:</HI> Thus having bid adieu, I make an</P>
