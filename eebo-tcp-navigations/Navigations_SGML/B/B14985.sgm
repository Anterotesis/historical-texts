<HEAD>THE KING OF BOHEMIA'S Welcome into the PALATINATE with the la&s;t defeat of Mon&s;ieur TILLIES Army, and other re|markeble thinges there, and el&s;ewhere.</HEAD>
<P>_THE turmoyles of Europe hauing gotten an vpperhand ouer the V|nity and Peace of the Nations, haue likewi&s;e preuayled with the very di&s;po&s;itions and affections of the people, &s;o that though neuer &s;o good Letters of credit come a|mong&s;t vs, they &s;hall receiue a &s;oyle of calumniation, euen by &s;uch, as yet know no cau&s;e, why they &s;hould traduce the writers: but &s;peake at randome, as either &s;ome &s;trange credulity tran&s;|ports them, or their own pa&s;&s;ions ouer&s;way rea&s;on and probability, and this is and hath beene reciprocall both betweene Papi&s;t and Prote&s;tants, &s;ince that fatall day in which the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was driuen out of <HI>Prague,</HI> and the magnanimous Queene taught a le&s;&s;on to try|umph ouer misfortune; the Papi&s;t wondring at the re|jection of the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and hauing no o|ther name for the intru&s;ion, but Trea&s;on, turbulency and ambitious V&s;urpation: The Prote&s;tant ju&s;tifying the action, as the determination of an Electiue Pro|uince, and that God had a worke in hand to propagate his Church and Religion. The Papi&s;t magnifying the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> as if it were impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand the Emperour, the Pope and King of <HI>Spaine:</HI> The Pro|te&s;tant alledging, that both Pope and Emperour mu&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="3">&s;ubmit to the Controler of all Popes and Emperours, and if he haue a cau&s;e in hand there is no pleading a|gain&s;t him, nor can any arme of Fle&s;h turne the frame of Heauen about.</P>
<P>The Papi&s;t maintaining, that all Kings and Princes doe act one anothers part, and therefore in the &s;ecrets of Combination &s;eeme not allow of Subjects to take vp Armes again&s;t their Princes, or that inferiours &s;hall conte&s;t with &s;uperiours in matters of any oppo&s;ition, wherein the Dignity of Soueraignty &s;hall &s;uffer dimi|nution, or the pre&s;umption of homagers admit of aug|mentation: The Prote&s;tant alledging, that it ab&s;olute|ly holdes in &s;ucce&s;&s;iue Monarchies, where the Subiect is bound patiently to tollerate the per&s;ecution, rather then re&s;i&s;t the power of the Prince by way of Ho&s;tility: But in Prouinces that are not tyed to &s;o &s;trict Obedi|ence, there may be Appologies made, and many cir|cum&s;tances produced to alledge the graunts of Prin|ces, and confirmations of Priuiledges, with the Digni|ties of free Citties, euen again&s;t Emperors them&s;elues, as in the Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Au&s;burgh:</HI> the manumitting of Townes, and the immunities of principallities, which either a Parliament hath con&s;ented vnto, a Prince rate|fied, money redeemed, or time effected and brought to pa&s;&s;e: And in this manner is all the newes of Eu|rope to&s;&s;ed betweene vs, yea banded vp and downe as Balles again&s;t the boards of a Tenni&s;court, till the &s;tuffing flye out of the leather, and the game is ended, except there be a fre&s;h &s;upply.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this diui&s;ion among&s;t vs, there is but one Truth in the Variation of all manner of acci|dents, yea in this la&s;t bu&s;ines of <HI>Tillies</HI> defeat, which
<PB N="3" REF="3">hath comforted all hone&s;t hearts, there may be many circum&s;tances, but the maine point is, the King of <HI>Bo|hemia</HI> hath preuayled, and for his welcome into the <HI>Pa|latinate</HI> found a better friend of Fortune (as wee pro|phanely abu&s;e that Character) then he expected, but becau&s;e I will not be too &s;odaine with you in this ioy|full tidings, giue me leaue not by way of digre&s;&s;ion, but by hone&s;t recollection of &s;ome former pa&s;&s;ages, to prepare and &s;ea&s;on your humours the better to enter|taine that you de&s;ire, or if you be of a contrary humor, to admit of that you cannot preuent or di&s;appoint.</P>
<P>I will meddle with nothing, that &s;hall reuiue your memories with matters di&s;ta&s;tfull: For that, which the Papi&s;t calls the wor&s;t, is &s;ubiect to con&s;truction and di&s;putation, and for the re&s;t neuer was the time or the Aduer&s;ary, &s;o powerfull and ouer daring, but there was interceptions and ca&s;ting of blockes in his faire&s;t walkes and &s;tronge&s;t cour&s;es of &s;ecurity. In the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Prague,</HI> the King was not altogether de&s;tituted and abandoned, but found a retiring place and friendly &s;uccors in <HI>Holland.</HI> In the reuolts of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mora|uia,</HI> the Marques of <HI>Ieggendor&s;e</HI> made &s;ome &s;top of that inundation, and hath &s;till and &s;till beene faithfull and loyall to the generall Cau&s;e. In the bringing in of a &s;trange Nation into <HI>Hungary,</HI> I meane the Spaniard in|to <HI>Rab, Camora, Presburgh,</HI> and the re&s;t; the Lords and Proceres brought in the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;iluania,</HI> which for any thing I &s;ee will not be &s;o ea&s;ily remoued or thru&s;t out againe: In the mu&s;tring the Forces of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> and proceedings of the Emperour, I hope the Deaths of <HI>Dampiers</HI> and <HI>Bucquoy,</HI> pull'd him back by the &s;leeue from running too fa&s;t to ouer pre&s;umption of
<PB N="4" REF="4">preuayling: In bringing in <HI>Spinola</HI> into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> our few Engli&s;h, and the Forces of the Princes, reba|ted the fury of their Tryumphs, and made a kinde of Circle, that tho&s;e Spirits could come no further, then limitation: In the donation of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> to <HI>Baua|ria,</HI> as a recompence of his &s;eruice for taking of <HI>Prague,</HI> I finde no great cau&s;e of exaltation, for both he and <HI>Tilley</HI> are with&s;tood, and peraduenture the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> him&s;elfe repines at the matter, and may &s;tand Newter for any thing the Emperour knowes, and then God knowes how the wheele of Fortune may be tur|ned about, and a new face of alteration quickely vn|maske it &s;elfe, to the comfort of all hone&s;t hearted loo|kers on, and the di&s;may of &s;uch, as either wi&s;hed the thriuing of the Emperour, or pittyed the Palatine as a forlorne and for&s;aken man.</P>
<P>But now if I &s;hould demaund from whence comes Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who rai&s;ed vp the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;|wick?</HI> who cau&s;ed the Princes to remember them&s;elues and their Honours? who put into the Emperors heart to &s;end into <HI>England</HI> about a Peace? And in a worde who hath thru&s;t &s;o many Countries, and &s;o much trea|&s;ure into a Strangers hands, as you &s;ee by the procee|dings in the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Spires</HI> and el&s;ewhere, either you mu&s;t an&s;wer with the Prote&s;tant, it is the proui|dence of God to make <HI>Ahabs</HI> little Cloud powre downe &s;hewers of Raine, to the refre&s;hing the parched Land: or hang downe the head like a Bul-ru&s;h with the Papi&s;t, and cry out, that a bad cau&s;e doth &s;ome|times thriue again&s;t expectation, and men are tryed in this world to prepare them to patience, and other en|durances.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, and that I haue &s;hew'd you, the <HI>Bohemia</HI> cau&s;e was neuer &s;o de&s;perate, but there ap|peared heat and light in the Imbers, to manife&s;t there might yet a fire be made out of the &s;maller &s;parkes; there are certaine men will neuer beleeue any thing a|gain&s;t their owne humors, or if they be brought to a kinde of yeelding to the truth, they will interpo&s;e di|&s;tinction, Fortune, circum&s;tances, de&s;ertion of friends, di&s;order of Souldiers, and &s;uch like, and therefore I will hone&s;tly proceed in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> to this very houre, whereby you may &s;ee, that God made a hard, intemperate, and fro&s;tie Winter bring forth &s;pringing Flowers of comfort and pro&s;peritie.</P>
<P>I will not intermeddle with the di&s;po&s;ition of other Princes, or the re&s;olutions of Gouernment, either in affecting, or di&s;-affecting the cau&s;e: but come neerer vnto you and &s;ay, that while the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> lay at the <HI>Hage,</HI> many Treati&s;es, Me&s;&s;ages, and Coun&s;ells pa&s;&s;ed betweene the King of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> Him&s;elfe, the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the two Dukes of <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Vnion,</HI> Count <HI>Man&s;feild,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;iluania, Ieggendorff,</HI> Generall <HI>Vere,</HI> and many more, who all re&s;olued (by one meanes or other) to reintegrate the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ho|nor of the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> or make him &s;ome recom|pence for the lo&s;&s;es of his Countrey.</P>
<P>Whereupon, Count <HI>Man&s;feild</HI> being the onely &s;tir|ring Spirit in the&s;e glorious De&s;ignes, vnder&s;tanding that the <HI>Emperor</HI> was capitulating with the <HI>Hungarians</HI> for a Truce, and had &s;ent <HI>Bauaria's</HI> Duke to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and &s;urpri&s;e <HI>Heidelberg</HI> it &s;elfe, after the Prince of <HI>Anhalt</HI> was departed from the Ar|my,
<PB N="6" REF="5">betweene whom &s;ome emulation aro&s;e, of which I will not di&s;pute, concluded with the Marquis of <HI>Ieggendorff</HI> to diuide the Souldiers, being then in <HI>Mo|rauia,</HI> and follow <HI>Bauaria,</HI> which way &s;oeuer he went: This he did with that brauery and expedition, that he &s;tartled him from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> draue them into the Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Spiers</HI> Country, remoued the &s;iege of <HI>Francken|dale,</HI> vi&s;ited <HI>Mainheim,</HI> where Sir <HI>Horace Vere,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h lay, and &s;upplied the wants of many places, which before were ouer-pre&s;&s;ed with the bur|then of feare &amp; terror, of vtter defeat and expugnation.</P>
<P>Then he made a martiall progre&s;&s;e through many Countries, and as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was wont to write, <HI>Veni, Vidi, vici,</HI> he might well &s;ay, he came no where but they made &s;ome compo&s;ition with him. For, like a Ball of Snow in fro&s;ty weather, by the often rowling, groweth bigger and bigger; &s;o did his Armie increa&s;e, and the Countries where he came, &s;upplied their wants. Thus did he vi&s;ite <HI>Spiers, Wormes,</HI> and all tho&s;e Bi&s;hoprickes: Thus came he into <HI>Leopaldus</HI> Countrey, and tooke many Townes, with <HI>El&s;as Saueren</HI> it &s;elfe. Thus pro|ceeded he to <HI>Mentz, Strasburgh,</HI> and many Catholicke Citties, who redeemed their peace with great &s;tore of trea&s;ure. Thus did he vi&s;ite <HI>Loraine,</HI> and made a truce with the Duke for three yeares: And thus when he vn|der&s;tood of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tillies</HI> crueltie, and threatning of <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> he returned toward the <HI>Palatinate</HI> againe, both to lay downe a cooling Card for his o&s;tentation, and breath new comfort into the decayed e&s;tate of tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>By this time, Aprill begins both with them and with vs, and Count <HI>Man&s;feild</HI> &s;ends foure Regiments of
<PB N="7" REF="5">Souldiers into <HI>Mainheim,</HI> and the Townes adioyning, tarrying with the re&s;t of his Army at <HI>Germer&s;heim,</HI> and <HI>Determi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI> &s;poyling <HI>Bergau&s;en, Dil&s;perg, Mandech, Mutter&s;tat, Reinganhem, Manenheim,</HI> and other pla|ces, where he quartred his Forces: then he procee|ded to fortifie many Townes and Scon&s;es, and put Garri&s;ons into them; for by this time he had taken in almo&s;t all the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Spiers,</HI> the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> the townes of <HI>Haggenaw, Landenburg, Steine,</HI> and <HI>El&s;as,</HI> all which he left &s;ufficiently guarded, both to defend them&s;elues again&s;t any enemy, and to command the Countrey to &s;upply them with money and proui&s;ion. But becau&s;e his particular actions haue inuited you to the &s;uperui&s;ing of many Pamphlets, I will &s;peake no more of the &s;ame, but conclude, that by this time he heard of the King of <HI>Bohemia's</HI> comming to him, and &s;o tarried for him at <HI>Haggenaw,</HI> and about <HI>Mainhem,</HI> and when he came in deed (as you &s;hall heare hereafter) well-commed him with 18000. foote, and 6000. hor&s;e, the re&s;t of his army po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Bi&s;hop|pricke of <HI>Spiers,</HI> and commanding other places in <HI>Leo|paldus</HI> his Country; and thus much for <HI>Man&s;feild,</HI> be|fore the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> repayred into his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Palatinate.</HI> Now to <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and how he began and proceeded.</P>
<P>While the King and Queene of <HI>Bohemia</HI> lay at the <HI>Hage,</HI> and had certaine newes, that his mother was retired to <HI>Wittenberg</HI> both for her better &s;afetie, and better accommodating: <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and younger brother of that hou&s;e came to pre&s;ent his &s;ervice to the Queene, his neere kin&s;ewoman, and was honorably welcommed of the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="6">animated by the King of <HI>Denmarke</HI> him&s;elfe, who &s;ee|ing him forwarde, young, lu&s;tie, and valiant thought him a fit in&s;trument to play his ma&s;ters pri&s;e in the&s;e turbulent times, &amp; cro&s;&s;e affaires, whereupon among&s;t them they &s;upplied him with a &s;mall Armie and trea|&s;ure, wherein and whereby hee had &s;uch fortunate &s;ucce&s;&s;e, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Collen,</HI> a Prince Elector, was afraid of him, and at la&s;t compelled to &s;end to <HI>Ba|varia,</HI> and the Spani&s;h Garri&s;ons for &s;uccours, which was accordingly granted him: For <HI>Bavaria</HI> and his Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> playing the wantons with the poore Townes, and the trod-vpon vines of the Pallatinate, and taking advantage of Count <HI>Man&s;feilds</HI> remote|nes, euen as farre as the borders of <HI>Loraine,</HI> &s;ent both hor&s;e and foote, yea <HI>Tilly</HI> once or twi&s;e went out in per&s;on to encounter with <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> be&s;ides the Bi&s;hop obtained &s;uccours and commanders from <HI>We&s;ell</HI> and <HI>Gulick,</HI> and all to meete with this youthfull &s;ervant of <HI>Mars,</HI> who in my con&s;cience emulating Count <HI>Man&s;|feilds</HI> glory, and de&s;iring to imitate him in all vertu|ous actions, advanced him&s;elfe the &s;ooner, and the forewarder on the Martiall Theater, and as you haue likewi&s;e heard, prevailed in many &s;kirmi&s;hes, and had the glory of as many victories. For he vexed the Coun+trey, came to <HI>Pater-borne</HI> and <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> compounded with the Villages, expul&s;ed the Bi&s;hop to &s;ome Ca&s;tle of &s;ecuritie, and had faire language euen of the Citty it &s;elfe: thus increa&s;ed hee to 1200 &s;trong, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed divers peeces of Ordnance, and fire workes, had &s;un|drie &s;upplies from <HI>Bream,</HI> and other Princes, was a&s;|&s;ured that the <HI>Lant&s;graue</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> &amp; the Princes of the <HI>Vnion</HI> would come to a new compo&s;ition with Fortune
<PB N="9" REF="6">for the recovery of their credits, and &s;o re&s;olved to goe forward for the King of <HI>Bohemia's</HI> de&s;ignements, and did indeede doe many things worthy the honour of a better experienced Commander.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> &s;aw the breaking out of this light from the thickning clouds of the former di&s;comfiture; and apparent &s;ignes manife&s;ted vnto him of better hopes, but e&s;pecially when hee vnder&s;tood that the Emperour had &s;ent Count <HI>Swatzenhourg</HI> in|to England about a treatie of peace, hee began to be&s;tirre him&s;elfe and indeede was afraid he might bee countermaunded in his great pro&s;ecutions; For his &s;u&s;pition aro&s;e from the&s;e grounds.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t from the Princely di&s;po&s;ition of the King his Father in law to peace, who &s;tudied nothing more then to avoid the effu&s;ion of blood, and keepe one even cour&s;e of charitie, noblene&s;&s;e, and corre&s;pondencie with all Princes.</P>
<P>Secondly, from a determination in England to &s;end the Lord of <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> who had beene <HI>Irelands</HI> Deputy, and a long well de&s;erving Souldier, into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> about the rendition, or compo&s;ition for the &s;ame, which though hee thought was no fit recompence for his lo&s;&s;es and &s;poyles there, yet was it a gladne&s;&s;e and a matter of con&s;equence, becau&s;e the &s;ooner it was cleered of Enemies, the &s;ooner it might recouer her pri&s;tinate flori&s;hing and hand&s;omnes, onely he feared lea&s;t &s;o great a benefite imparted by the King of En|gland with the in&s;upportable charges he had beene at before, and mu&s;t be tied to now, would be a kinde of barre and procra&s;tination of his other purpo&s;es, and finall re&s;olutions.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P>Thirdly, From the nature and manner of the <HI>Empe|rors</HI> Emba&s;&s;ie, with the attraction of the per&s;on to win his purpo&s;e, (for what euer the Papi&s;ts &s;ay, the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> de&s;ired no peace, but &s;till thought vpon and proiected the recouery of his honor.) Now <HI>Swatzen|bourg</HI> was a comely, Courtly Gentleman, of a good pre&s;ence, and habituall vertues, to effectuate any bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e, hauing made a kind of compo&s;ition to goe into <HI>England</HI> at his owne charge, and performe this &s;eruice by way of gratuitie, and recompence to his imperiall Maie&s;tie, for his procuring him a wife, which belike both plea&s;ed his affection, and aduanced his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Fourthly, From a new a&s;&s;urance of the di&s;content|ments of <HI>Prague,</HI> who de&s;ired once againe to &s;ee him at the head of &s;ome &s;ufficient troupes, and to make him recompence for their former de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Fiftly, from the &s;trength of his own friends, who were now able to mu&s;ter an Army, greater then any in <HI>Chri|&s;tendom,</HI> &amp; therfore why &s;huld a peace countermand his forwardnes, &amp; pul him back in the race to a new glory.</P>
<P>Sixtly, From the Emperors weake preparations; for there were few Forces rai&s;ed, and le&s;&s;e money in a rea|dines: Be&s;ides, the Army out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the trea&s;ure from <HI>Spaine</HI> failed in the <HI>Valtoline,</HI> and among&s;t the <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> whereby <HI>Leopaldus</HI> was much di&s;contented, and di&s;countenanced; yea, out of hope to recouer his lo&s;&s;es in his Country, and &s;o had cau&s;e to complaine, but no meanes of redre&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Seuenthly, From the repinings of the Duke of <HI>Saxo|ny,</HI> who had di&s;puted the matter with a me&s;&s;enger from the <HI>Emperor,</HI> about the donation of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> from the heires of the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> to a &s;tranger, which
<PB N="11" REF="7">mu&s;t needs breed an innouation among the Prouinces: For neither was the <HI>Emperor</HI> to challenge the Empire as hereditary to <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> nor to inflict the children of any Prince with &s;uch a puni&s;hment, for the Fathers of|fence, be it trea&s;on, or what you will.</P>
<P>Eightly, La&s;t of all, from the intermixture of Reli|gions, which now made him more zealous to expell <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and &s;uper&s;tition out of his <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and take pitty on the teares of &s;o many thou&s;and Prote&s;tants, who euery where began to complaine of the crueltie of the Bi&s;hops, and the tyranny of the Ie&s;uits that thun dred out nothing but warre, and reuenge, blood and death, fire and &s;poile, hell &amp; damnation again&s;t them.</P>
<P>All which things con&s;idered, hee thought it high time to come to prevention, and approch neerer and neerer to &s;ome publick practi&s;e of anticipation, lea&s;t the mi&s;cheife &s;hould grow incurable, and the vexation remediles: This as you haue heard made him ha&s;&s;ard his per&s;on, and expo&s;e his Fortunes to a wonderfull and dangerous iourney: For in the fir&s;t weeke of A|prill (&s;ome will haue it on a Sunday,) hee re&s;olved to retire privately from the <HI>Hage,</HI> and &s;ent Sir <HI>Francis Nether&s;all</HI> to <HI>Dort,</HI> to provide him a &s;hip, but not di&s;|cover the bu&s;ines: &s;o with onely 10, per&s;ons di&s;gui|&s;ed, and a &s;mall Cabinet of Iewels, hee embarked him&s;elfe, and landed at <HI>Callice,</HI> from whence he tooke wagon for <HI>Amiens,</HI> where &s;ome will haue him di&s;coue|red, in&s;omuch that the Governour taken with his no|ble and heroick demeanour, offered him his &s;ervice, and re&s;olved to entertaine him according to his dig|nitie, and worth, but it &s;hould &s;eeme, hee refu&s;ed all ceremonie: for he onely reque&s;ted taciturnity, and &s;o
<PB N="12" REF="8">went forward on his iourney: but whether it hapned in this particular, or no, it matters not, &s;ure I am, hee went &s;afe from <HI>Amiens,</HI> and as &s;ome will haue it, hi|red two wagons through the wood, and a <HI>Provo&s;t Mar|&s;hall</HI> to accompany him, hauing good Petronels and other weapons among&s;t them, in which manner they came to <HI>Sedan,</HI> not yet di&s;covered: but when the Duke of <HI>Bolloigne,</HI> who being very old kept his Pallace here vnder&s;tood of his acce&s;&s;e, and by former letters was ad|verti&s;ed of his intent, and purpo&s;e, hee ro&s;e to meete him and in &s;uch a fa&s;hion, that it was quickly noy&s;ed ouer the Couutrey, &s;hhat an e&s;cape he had made: but notwith&s;tanding his great entertainement heere, he de|termined not to tarry, nor did the Duke thinke it con|venient, that rumor &s;hould any way prepare his Ene|mies for his interception, &s;o within a day or two hee provided a &s;ufficient convoy for him: and he came be|fore Ea&s;ter fir&s;t to <HI>Landaw,</HI> &s;econdly to <HI>Germ&s;hen,</HI> third|ly, to <HI>Haggenaw,</HI> and la&s;t of all to <HI>Mainhem.</HI></P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that a little before his ac|ce&s;&s;e, Count <HI>Mansfeild:</HI> the <HI>Margraue</HI> of <HI>Tur&s;o,</HI> Generall <HI>Vere,</HI> and Colonell <HI>Overtrout,</HI> had beene in coun&s;ell at <HI>Mainhem</HI> aboue two houres, which di&s;&s;olued, they re|turned to their quarters, and Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> prepared an Armie to goe meete the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which was not, nor could be &s;o couertly done, but the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and <HI>Tilley</HI> had notice of the &s;ame, who newly returned from being fle&s;hed with the blood of inno|cents, as &s;paring neither man, woman, nor child, in cer|tain villages betweene <HI>Heidelberg</HI> &amp; <HI>Mainhem,</HI> in which iollitie they attempted to &s;et vpon the Reare of Count <HI>Mansfeilds</HI> Army, alreadie on foote for &s;ome enterpri&s;e,
<PB N="13" REF="8">and defeated &s;ome of his Foot &amp; &s;ome of his Waggons. For when he vnder&s;tood that <HI>Mansfield</HI> had made a long march and was remote from the place, and knew the Gar|ri&s;ons of <HI>Franckendale</HI> and <HI>Mainhem,</HI> &s;afe from i&s;&s;uing out, or making any Sallies, he tooke the aduantage, and &s;et vp|on the &s;tragling Company, and &s;o in a iollity returned to his Quarter.</P>
<P>By this time is the King welcommed to the Army, or as &s;ome haue it, returned with the &s;ame, which went to meet him: and &s;o came to <HI>Mainhem,</HI> where a whole day was &s;pent in Ceremony, and ob&s;eruation toward him, in&s;o|much that &s;ome will haue reciprocall teares, &amp; pa&s;&s;ionate imbraces betweene him and Sir <HI>Horace Vere;</HI> yea not an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man pa&s;&s;ed without &s;haking by the hand, &amp; Prince|ly thankfulnes: the extacy betweene <HI>Mansfield</HI> &amp; him had her determination the day before, and to adde to the ioy of this welcome, the people brought in their pre&s;ents, and euen from <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> and <HI>Bazill,</HI> the Riuers were filled with Boates, who came downe on heapes to &s;ee their Prince, and &s;hew their Duty, &s;o that whereas before Mut|ton, Butter, and good accates &s;eldome fell to the Gene|rals &s;hare: the common Soldier now renued his acquain|tance euen with Pullen, Fowle, Fi&s;h, and Pa&s;tery, yea ma|ny a dainty di&s;h.</P>
<P>Well, time addes a period to all thinges, and their af|faires put them in minde of other bu&s;ines: For you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that both <HI>Gonzales Cordua</HI> and the Spaniards, and <HI>Bauaria</HI> and <HI>Tilley</HI> with their Colonels, and Captaines, vn|der&s;tand of all this, and demeaned them&s;elues like vndan|ted Souldiers for all the alteration: <HI>Gonzales</HI> and his Spa|niards lying in <HI>Openheim, Cru&s;nach,</HI> and other places, kept their former repo&s;ednes, and neuer &s;hewed a motiue of
<PB N="14" REF="9">di&s;temperature, or any pa&s;&s;ion for the newes: But per|aduenture &s;tood vpon a Guard of better circum&s;pection, and &s;trengthned their Watches with ouerlooking the Fortifications: <HI>Tilley</HI> was brauer then euer, mu&s;tring his Forces, drawing out his Army, and increa&s;ing it with <HI>Bauaria's</HI> new &s;upply: For you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that not two dayes before the King of <HI>Bohemia's</HI> arriuall, the Emperour had &s;ent a Me&s;lenger to Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> a|bout the ce&s;&s;ation of Armes, and certaine other Propo|&s;itions concerning the good of Chri&s;tendome, and pa|cification of the pre&s;ent troubles, who quickly returned an&s;wer, that hee was now but a &s;econd per&s;on, and mu&s;t yeeld to a higher Soueraignty, for the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was come in per&s;on into the Field; neither was this An&s;wer plea&s;ing to the Emperour nor the Title, yet for the time making a Vertue of patience, he depended on a better &s;atisfaction: and &s;ent &s;uch Forces as he could into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> with whom <HI>Tilley</HI> proiected great matters.</P>
<P>All this while Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> lyes in wayte for re|uenge, and &s;o leauing the King to ouerlooke the Fortifi|cations of <HI>Mainhem,</HI> &amp; <HI>Franckendale:</HI> where he was made acquainted with the &s;euerall accidents and lo&s;&s;es, which happened in the &s;iege of <HI>Franckendale:</HI> He takes an op|portunity of <HI>Tilley's</HI> brauery, and acquaints the King with his purpo&s;e, who thereupon brauely re&s;olueth to goe in per&s;on into the Field. But concerning that, time &s;hall di&s;couer more? It is now &s;ufficient, and &s;uffici|ently well, that vnder&s;tanding, that <HI>Tilley</HI> was lodged within a Village not farre from the Towne, wherein he had left the memories of his Cruelty, and within foure Leagues of <HI>Heidelburgh,</HI> he layde an Ambu&s;cado of 2000. Hor&s;e and Foote to entrap him. For as I &s;aid, he recided
<PB N="15" REF="9">a little remote from the mayne body of his Army, hauing onely two Regiments with him, being 3000. and at this time was &s;omewhat carele&s;&s;e, and le&s;&s;e thought of a Skir|mi&s;h, becau&s;e he imagined the Enemy would bee detay|ned from fighting, as bu&s;ied in Welcomming the Prince, whereupon Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> likewi&s;e apprehending as much, and de&s;iring of all other thinges to drawe him in per&s;on into the Field, came toward him with 600. Shot, and Pikes, and &s;ome few Hor&s;e, who &s;eemed rather to braue him, then intended to Fight with him, and becau&s;e hee &s;hould be the better induced to come neare the Ambu&s;cado: Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> retired to the head of the&s;e ob&s;cure Troopes, and &s;heltred him&s;elfe vndi&s;co|uered: the re&s;t that were to Skirmi&s;h indeed, made onely &s;hew, as if they had beene but Forragers, &amp; came of purpo&s;e to get proui&s;ion for the Army, but now being &s;o neare the Enemy the Pikes made a &s;tand, and the Shot began a Skirmi&s;h, the Hor&s;e wheeling about to drawe them to better ground, then the Valley they were lodged in, and played their partes &s;o well, that <HI>Tilley</HI> would not be &s;o affronted, but re&s;olued to the Encounter, if they had beene as many more.</P>
<P>Thus he drew forth him&s;elfe, and his Captaines drew forth the re&s;t, &s;o that with 800. hor&s;e and &s;omewhat more then 3000. foot, he gaue the Alarum to the Villages, that a fight was begun: but ere his maine Army could prepare it &s;elfe, or Bauaria haue notice of the accident, the fight was begun, and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> with 2000. hor&s;e, and 500. Muskatieres pre&s;ently enclo&s;ed them, and as pre|&s;ently di&s;ranked them all: For what with the &s;uddainne&s;&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and the feare of a greater Army, or the apprehen&s;ion, that the King might be there in per&s;on, or
<PB N="16" REF="10">the apparant fury of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> charge, who was que&s;tionle&s;&s;e exa&s;perated again&s;t them: or the willing|ne&s;&s;e of the Souldier to be reuenged, who both remem|bred their owne wrongs, and his cruelty again&s;t the Pea|&s;ants: there pre&s;ently followed a lamentable &s;laughter: for the hor&s;e were rowted, and thronged &s;o fa&s;t one vpon another, that they lay &s;laine by heapes: the foote (as all Souldiers know) once di&s;placed, fell vnder the rage of the hor&s;e, yea were &s;ubiect to the foot, that kept their rankes, and came vpon them with violence: the &s;hot had al&s;o a &s;hare in the execution, as they had afterwards in the &s;poile, <HI>Tilly</HI> him&s;elfe fled, as peraduenture being better hor&s;ed, better breathed, and more cautelous, as apprehending the danger, and being more afraid to come within the danger of Captiuity: but whether he were hurt or no, is vncertaine.</P>
<P>But now you mu&s;t know, that the greate&s;t cau&s;e of this di&s;comfiture, came through <HI>Tillies</HI> owne ha&s;tine&s;&s;e, who was &s;o hot vpon the&s;e few Muskatieres, that he brake with his hor&s;e through his owne Pikes, who &s;tood in their open order to giue him pa&s;&s;age, and could not come in to forme and fa&s;hion againe, till certain Captaines of <HI>Man&s;|fields</HI> hor&s;e e&s;pied the aduantage, and &s;et vpon them at the fir&s;t, as &s;oone as the ambu&s;h brake out, and before they could rally them&s;elues together.</P>
<P>After the &s;laughter, which was reckoned very neere 2500. followed the &s;poile, many colours were taken, great &s;tore of Armes were &s;hared, diuers pri&s;oners re&s;erued, all the cariages diuided, and many hor&s;e le&s;t their Riders be|hind them on the ground.</P>
<P>To this you may adde, that while the Souldiers in Ga|ri&s;on drew them&s;elues out to &s;econd their fellowes, the
<PB N="17" REF="10">Pe&s;ants of the places tooke aduantage of the few number, which remained, and cut their throats, whereby they &s;up|po&s;e as much harme was done this way, as the other, and both wayes as is thought irrecouerable. I make no que|&s;tion of the Boonfires at Heidleberg, and prayers euery where. For this cau&s;e is generally &s;o well reputed of that without di&s;putation of the iu&s;tification of the warre, a world of friends come flocking in to the King, and in England the matter is &s;o well affected, that both good and bad wi&s;h well vnto the Queene: yea, the young Princes, who were neuer &s;eene among&s;t vs, are pittied of all &s;orts, to be depriued of their Fathers inheritance, and di&s;inheri|ted by the malignity of time, and the ouer-&s;ight (as the pa|pi&s;t will haue it) of their Father. But of that no more. It is &s;ufficient now to &s;ee the people glad, and heare their tongues eccho out their hearts wi&s;hes, and all for the pro|&s;perity of the Palatinate, wherein I &s;hall not be beleeued, if I tell you the friends which are rai&s;ed, the helps promi|&s;ed, the prayers made, the contribution prepared, and the meanes di&s;couered for the re&s;tauration. For the Duke of Wittenberg is ready, and hath diuers forces mu&s;tered, which the Emperour repines at, and goeth about to in|tercept: but becau&s;e the Kings Mother is in his Court, and that there may be better v&s;e of them in his Countrey, to defend the &s;ame, and be in a readine&s;&s;e at more neede. It hath beene agreed vpon by a Coun&s;ell of Warre, that he &s;hall detaine them there, and &s;tand the better vpon the Guard of oppo&s;ition, if the Emperour enforce him, or as he hath done, command him to attend Bauaria, or whom he &s;hall appoint.</P>
<P>The Marqne&s;&s;e of Baden hath al&s;o &s;ent word, that his Army is 10000. and longs to ioyne with Count <HI>Man&s;|field,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="11">but e&s;pecially to &s;ee the King of Bohemia, who&s;e ca&s;e according to the fortune of great per&s;ons in aduer&s;ity, is now much lamented, con&s;idering it might haue beene a temptation to haue ouercome any of them all, who euer reputed Bohemia &s;ubiect to election, and the choi&s;e of the Lords, and as for the King, hee came not in with an Army, nor proiected to fortifie his owne Countrey: but tooke an honorable retinue with him, and would not out of &s;u&s;pition giue the Emperour cau&s;e of iealou&s;ie, that ei|ther his owne ambition ha&s;tned him to the dignity, or any pollicy or bribery had wrought the Lords and Ele|ctors vnder-hand to preferre him before another.</P>
<P>The Duke of Brun&s;wick is great with the birth of &s;ome braue action in his behalfe, and longs for the deliuery, but is adui&s;ed to remaine, where hee doth, and &s;end to the Lantzgraue of He&s;s for his forces, that he may both pro|&s;ecute the Bi&s;hop of Cullen: and attend <HI>Saxony,</HI> to know what he will doe either in Sile&s;ia or Bohemia: For now is the time of the bu&s;ines, and of the yeere, &s;o that if he hold his peace at this time, he may for euer hereafter be &s;ilent. To talke of the elder Brun&s;wick, or the Marque&s;&s;e of Bran|denburg, were onely to fill vp a Catalogue with names without actions: For their Countries are &s;o remote, that they may doe more good with their pur&s;es, then their per&s;ons, wherein I make no que&s;tion they will be indul|gent, and con&s;idering &s;o many motiues of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I re|&s;olue my &s;elfe the disbur&s;ing of trea&s;ure &s;hall not be a wall of &s;eperation betweene the Kings cau&s;e, and their care, and &s;hal leaue them to the due examination of the mat|ter, which &s;hall as much enlarge their own honour, as augment his dignity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the greater circles, which moue in this Sphere
<PB N="19" REF="11">of turbulency, concerning the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of Europe, and the difficulties of Warre, which as it is begun, &s;o in plaine termes cannot end without effu&s;ion of blood, and rai&s;ing vp of &s;tormes; nay, I am afraide, that as the Sea exagita|ted remaines &s;tormy, and full of high billowes after the winde is laid, &s;o will it fall to Europes &s;hare: let the&s;e contentions be pacified, when they can, the heires of the&s;e Princes, and the &s;eedes of di&s;cention may remember for|mer vnkindne&s;&s;e, and &s;prowt vp againe, as the ground is either nouri&s;hed or manured, except (which is heere not to be &s;poken of) the cau&s;es of the Warre, and occa&s;ion of the grieuances might be either &s;tifled in their infancie, or digged vp in their full growth, and firme flouri&s;hing, root and all.</P>
<P>To conclude in a word, this defeat of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tillie</HI> was the 12. or 14. of April. They purpo&s;e to haue 2. armies made of the&s;e forces, the 1. for <HI>Bauaria,</HI> the other for <HI>Bohe|mia.</HI> They will haue the King to admit of no peace, &amp; yet &s;ubmit to the Maie&s;tie of England. And they will haue an ab&s;olute expul&s;ion of the Ie&s;uites, where&s;oeuer they come, and puni&s;hment of the Catholick Prie&s;ts, that haue &s;tored their inuectiues with vnciuill termes, and odious defamation.</P>
