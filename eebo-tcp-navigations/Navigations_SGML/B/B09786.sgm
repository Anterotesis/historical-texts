<HEAD><HI>Prince Butler</HI>'s QUERICAL DEMONSTRATIONS Relating to The Ea&s;t-India Trade. Part II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SInce &s;ome very good Friends, of both <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Stocks,</HI> are endeavouring, by all hone&s;t ways, together, to joyn, and in order thereto, are <HI>Writing, Pleading,</HI> and <HI>Printing</HI> their Ca&s;es; and &s;ince <HI>Lo&s;ers</HI> have always the Liberty to &s;peak, why may not I as well <HI>Print</HI> and <HI>Plead</HI> my Ca&s;e; For I am &s;ure I have as much, <HI>nay more</HI> rea&s;on to do it than they?</P>
<P N="2">2. If the&s;e two contending <HI>Stocks</HI> be made one, and the <HI>Engli&s;h Manufacturers</HI> Ca&s;e be not taken &s;ome care of, I can, without Star-gazing, plainly fore&s;ee, That they, and &s;ome <HI>other Folks,</HI> &s;oon <HI>Ruin'd</HI> will be; And therefore pray, Mind what I &s;ay; If not for their &s;akes, for your own, be pleas'd to take care on't.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not much more demon&s;trable, That the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade is of greater advantage to <HI>England</HI> than 'twas two Years ago; For &s;ince that time, it has in a great mea&s;ure Ruined the <HI>Canterbury Silk Trade,</HI> and obliged mo&s;t of the <HI>London Silk Weavers, Throw&s;ters,</HI> &amp;c. to give over their &s;everal Trades and Employments?</P>
<P N="4">4. Will not this be of great Advantage to all the <HI>Clothing Counties</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e &s;ome of the&s;e poor People, rather than &s;tarve, are gone to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;et up Trade there; others fall'n to <HI>Comb, Card,</HI> and <HI>Spin;</HI> make <HI>Cloths; Stuffs</HI> and <HI>Serges;</HI> who being at the Principal Mar|ket, can make and &s;ell them as well, or better, than the Country Weaver and Clothier can do?</P>
<P N="5">5. Does not Sir <HI>Jo&s;. Child,</HI> who is well known to be Skilful in Trade, prove plainly, That the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;cour&s;e of Trade. <HI>The Pre|face.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade ought to be greatly Encouraged, when he tells us in Print, That <HI>the Expence of Foreign Commodities, e&s;pecially Foreign Manufactures, is the wor&s;t Expence a Nation can be inclinable to, and ought to be prevented as much as po&s;&s;ible?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Has not the <HI>Author</HI> of the E&s;&s;ay on the <HI>E. India Trade,</HI> as &s;ufficiently proved it Gainful, not <NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;ay on the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Trade</HI> page 14.</NOTE> only to us, but all <HI>Europe,</HI> when he tells us, <HI>They had been Richer by a full Third than they now are, if that Trade had never been Di&s;covered or Undertaken; and that it bears hard only upon tho&s;e Countries that Con&s;ume tho&s;e Commodities?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Is it not plain, That it bears not hard upon <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince it could never be proved (and I <HI>challenge</HI> any now to do it) That we Con&s;ume at <HI>Home,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or our <HI>Plantations,</HI> above nine parts in ten: Or that in Foreign Parts (except our Plantations, <HI>&amp;c)</HI> there are Con&s;umed above one eighth part of the <HI>Wrought Silks, Bengals,</HI> and <HI>Printed Callicoes?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Since 'tis allowed this Trade is hurtful to <HI>Europe,</HI> and all are agreed in a General Peace, What if they &s;hould agree to Bani&s;h it out of all their Dominions? But if not, Why &s;hould we re&s;train any part, Since <HI>we have nothing from thence of &s;olid U&s;e,</HI> (but) <HI>Materials for Luxury, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 12.</NOTE> <HI>peri&s;hable Commodities, for our Gold and Silver, which is there buried,</HI> as the &s;ame <HI>Author</HI> tells us?</P>
<P N="9">9. Is it not better we &s;hould be at four or five hundred thou&s;and Pounds Charge <HI>per An.</HI> for <HI>In|dian Vanities,</HI> having &s;uch plenty of Money, than for the &s;ake of imploying our own <HI>Poor,</HI> upon our own <HI>Wooll,</HI> di&s;oblige &s;everal <HI>Maids</HI> and their <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> who would then be at a lo&s;s how to Dre&s;s up <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> their <HI>Chambers, Parlours,</HI> and <HI>Clo&s;ets?</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Is it not our Intere&s;t (as the E&s;&s;ayer tells us) to wear the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures, becau&s;e they would &s;oon bring down the price of our own &s;o low, <HI>That we may Export them to all Foreign</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 29.</NOTE> <HI>Markets, and be able to under &s;ell all Nations;</HI> For (&s;urely) they neither can, or will ever think of falling in their Prices as we do.</P>
<P N="11">11. Or if they &s;hould, rather than leave off and <HI>&s;tarve,</HI> &s;ell their Commodities as cheap as we, Pray what &s;hall we get by this <HI>Learned Advice,</HI> &s;ince, after all, our Reducing the <HI>Indian,</HI> that Work for a Peny a Day, will out do us all, unle&s;s we're re&s;olv'd to Work as Cheap, or Cheaper than they?</P>
<P N="12">12. Will not the Falling the Prices reduce the Wages of the <HI>Poor,</HI> and by that means make the Nation grow <HI>Rich,</HI> &s;ince Sir <HI>Jo&s;. Child</HI> has very well ob&s;erved, <HI>That where ever Wages are high,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Preface.</NOTE> <HI>throughout the whole World, it is an</HI> infallible <HI>Evidence of the Riches of that Country; And where Wages for Labour runs low, 'tis a proof of the Poverty of that Place?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. But if bringing down the Prices will be &s;uch an Advantage, Why may we not as well &s;end for the <HI>Corn</HI> we &s;pend to the <HI>Ea&s;t Country,</HI> for theirs is much cheaper than ours? And then we may &s;end our own <HI>Corn</HI> with our own <HI>Cloth,</HI> &amp;c. to &s;eek Abroad for a Market; Would not this &s;oon Rai&s;e the Value of all the <HI>Rents</HI> and <HI>Lands</HI> in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. And to &s;ave yet the more, employ the <HI>Dutch Shipping,</HI> for they always Sail much cheaper than we do, and then we may &s;end our own <HI>Ships</HI> to all Foreign Nations, that either want, or will hire them, or el&s;e &s;ave the Building of more, to the much greater Pre&s;ervation of both our <HI>Seamen</HI> and <HI>Timber?</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. And if nought but cheap Working will vend our Commodities, let's to't in good earne&s;t, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 27.</NOTE> and Employ the <HI>Twelve hundred Thou&s;and</HI> which the E&s;&s;ay tells us receives Alms, which by the way is a very great Number, and &s;hews how much we want the <HI>poor Indians</HI> to Work for us, and they &s;ure
<PB REF="2"> will bring down the Prices &s;o low, that when our Money is gone, the <HI>Indians</HI> will take &s;ome <HI>Stuffs</HI> for their <HI>Callicoes.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. What if the <HI>Landed Men</HI> &s;hould apprehend, that this would <HI>Begger</HI> their <HI>Tenants,</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> all their <HI>Rents,</HI> Can't we by another <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> with <HI>Rhetorical Flouri&s;hes,</HI> amu&s;e them, and then by <HI>imaginary,</HI> or <HI>fabulous</HI> Computation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> prove this cannot be; Or that 'tis our <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> it &s;hould be &s;o, rather than re&s;train the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade?</P>
<P N="17">17. Has not this Nation been great Gainers for many Years by the u&s;e of <HI>Mu&s;lings</HI> and <HI>Calli|coes,</HI> which are worn in the room of <HI>German Linnens, Sile&s;ia Cambricks,</HI> and <HI>Lawns?</HI> For the fir&s;t we have had for our <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Bullion:</HI> The la&s;t were the Return of our own <HI>Woollen Mann|factures,</HI> which now we can keep for our own u&s;e at Home.</P>
<P N="18">18. Were not the <HI>Sile&s;ians</HI> very great <HI>Fools,</HI> when we would not take off their <HI>Cambricks</HI> and <HI>Lawns,</HI> to &s;et up the making of <HI>Woollen,</HI> with which they now &s;upply both them&s;elves and their Neighbours; Whereas we could yet have very well &s;erved them both for their <HI>Money?</HI> And may not &s;ome others &s;oon follow &s;uch <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> Examples?</P>
<P N="19">19. If the <HI>Parliament</HI> would be &s;o kind as to take off the Duty from cour&s;e <HI>Callicoes,</HI> which be|ing from twenty to fifty <HI>per Cent.</HI> is a very great Clog upon them; We could then al&s;o &s;oon beat them out of mo&s;t of the re&s;t of their <HI>Linnens,</HI> which might be as much more for the <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Gain</HI> of this Kingdom.</P>
<P N="20">20. But if this will le&s;&s;en the <HI>Cu&s;toms,</HI> we're content they &s;hould double the Duties on all Wrought Silks; for they may well bear about 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> And being &s;uch <HI>Bulky Commodities,</HI> &s;ure none will Run them to &s;ave &s;uch &s;mall Cu&s;toms, or the Ladies wear them when they'll be &s;o dear: And will not this plea&s;e the <HI>Clamorous Silk Weavers?</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. Or if they <HI>complain</HI> &s;till, Can any one think the <HI>Parliament</HI> may not have &s;ome regard to &s;o con&s;iderable a Company of <HI>poor Manufacturers</HI> as they are? When as, with no very great <HI>dif|ficulty,</HI> they lately pa&s;s'd an Act for <HI>Relief</HI> and <HI>Support</HI> of the <HI>Hair</HI> and <HI>Silk</HI> Button-Makers?</P>
<P N="22">22. If the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company had Imported the&s;e Commodities, would it not have been ea&s;ier for the&s;e <HI>Button Makers</HI> to have gained their Bill? And &s;ince the <HI>Parliament</HI> have pa&s;t an Act in fa|vour of the <HI>Trimmings,</HI> may they not in time do as much for the Principal Parts of the <HI>Garments?</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. And now to conclude: To your &s;elves be &s;o <HI>kind,</HI> The&s;e Quericals <HI>mind,</HI> For they are <HI>de&s;ign'd,</HI> To inform all <HI>Mankind,</HI> So as Truth they may <HI>find,</HI> If <HI>not</HI> wilfully <HI>Blind:</HI> But who&s;oe'r by private Intere&s;t is <HI>&s;way'd,</HI> Or Money have <HI>paid,</HI> To the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Aid,</HI> I am very much <HI>afraid,</HI> That for all I have <HI>&s;aid,</HI> They will me <HI>upbraid,</HI> And cry out <HI>I am Mad.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. But if they do, I mu&s;t tell them <HI>plain,</HI> I find in my <HI>Brain,</HI> So much Sen&s;e &s;till <HI>remain,</HI> As the Cau&s;e I'll <HI>maintain,</HI> 'Gain&s;t them and their <HI>Train:</HI> Therefore don't <HI>di&s;dain,</HI> My Queri|cal <HI>Strain,</HI> And I &s;hall <HI>remain,</HI> Your Friend as <HI>before,</HI> To &s;tand at your <HI>Door,</HI> To plead for the <HI>Poor,</HI> And have yet in <HI>&s;tore,</HI> Of &s;uch Quericals <HI>more,</HI> At lea&s;t a whole <HI>Score:</HI> Which you may have when you plea&s;e.</P>
