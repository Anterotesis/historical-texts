<PB N="74" REF="41"> upon. The way for us, to have our <HI>Hou|&s;es</HI> taken away from us, is, to have our <HI>Hearts</HI> vainly fond of continuing in them.

<P>Oh! Let us not be tho&s;e <HI>Fools,</HI> of whom 'tis &s;aid in P&s;al. 49.11. <HI>Their Inward Thought is, that their Hou&s;es &s;hall continue for ever, and their Dwelling-places to all Generations:</HI> Nor let us fooli&s;hly count, the <HI>Goods</HI> in our Hou&s;es, <HI>Goods laid up for

<P>And what &s;hould be the I&s;&s;ue of &s;uch Con&s;iderations?
