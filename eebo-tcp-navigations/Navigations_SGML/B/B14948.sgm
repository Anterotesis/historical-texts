<P>Three dayes agone are pa&s;&s;ed by, 2. mile from this Cittie 6000. Hungarians (cho&s;en out Sol|diers) under the General Redi&s;erens, vvhich are gon to our Head-camp, &amp; the Enimie lieth yet near unto ours by Rackonits, though the crie goeth, that the enimie cau&s;ed all his might to com togither, to com this vvayes again&s;t Prage, if that comes to pa&s;&s;e, it &s;hall not run of vvith|out blovves, the vvhich might be revealed vvith in fevv dayes.</P>
<P>It continues, that in the Sat&s;er Crais are ga|thered togither 10000 Contrie-men, mo&s;t high-dutch-men, again&s;t Mei&s;&s;en, &amp; no Bohemians, they vvill help the King, to drive the enimie out of the Land. In like manner &s;om certaine 1000 Contrie-men rebel in the Lentmarit&s;cher Crais, but it is feared that tho&s;e Countrie-men are &s;tarred up, through practi&s;e of the Adver&s;arie, that the enimie in the meane vvhile might com to Prage. Wee under&s;tand, that Bucquoy hath not been in the Camp, but by the Duke of Saxen &s;om certaine dayes, therefore vve are to looke to our &s;elves, for feare of Trecherie. And it is thought that the Emperour vvill leave Au&s;tria to the Hungorians, &amp; &s;ee to effect his intention only uppon Praghe.</P>

<P>Letters out of Neurenburghe of the 20 of this pre&s;ent, make mention, that they had advi&s;e from the Borders of Bohemia, that there had beene a very great Battel by Prage, betvveen the King &amp; the Duke of Beyeren, &amp; many 1000. &s;laine on both &s;ides, but that the Duke of Beye|ren &s;hould have any folke vvith in Prage, is yet uncertaine, there uppon under the Merchants vvith in Neurenberge are laid many 100. Florins that the Emperour, nor the Duke of Beyeren have no folke vvith in Prage. The cau&s;e that here comes no certainty thereof, is this; That all pa&s;|&s;ages are &s;o be&s;et, &amp; &s;o dangerous to travaile, that it is to vvondered at, &amp; not enough to be vvritte~ of, vvhat roveing, &s;poyling and killing is done dayly uppon all vvayes.</P>
