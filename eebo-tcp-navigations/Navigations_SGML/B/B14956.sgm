<HEAD>The true and perfect Relation concerning the maine pa&s;&s;age, now expected, and lately happened betweene the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> and the Imperiall Army.

<P>IT hath plea&s;ed Almighty God this &s;econd time to &s;hew him&s;elfe favourable towards his Church, and to worke a great worke for us. For the pa&s;&s;age over the River of <HI>Lech</HI> could not po&s;&s;ibly be pa&s;&s;ed over, without very great difficulty. The rea&s;on is becau&s;e Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> with his whole Army lay on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>This River is not very broad, but runneth very &s;wiftly and is very hardly pa&s;&s;ed over. His Maj. of <HI>Sweden</HI> being ac|quainted with the &s;ame River, had di&s;cryed and taken no|tice of &s;ome place where the River doth circumvent and
<PB N="11" REF="7"> encompa&s;&s;e &s;ome ground, as it were in forme of an I&s;land. His Maj. of <HI>Sweden</HI> did entrench this whole Circle, where two dayes &s;ince he cau&s;ed batteries to be built &amp; rai&s;ed, &amp; with a retrenchment drew the &s;ame to one Lyne, right be|fore the I&s;land his Mai. cau&s;ed the Bridge to be layd, and &s;ent &s;ome men on the other &s;ide with piles there to be fa|&s;tened. Where al&s;o they rai&s;ed a halfe Moone. Whereupon at &s;everall places the Alarum was &s;trucke up, and the troupes began to march; but whereas ye&s;terday, early in the morning there did ri&s;e a very foggy mi&s;t, the enemy knew not whither to betake him&s;elfe, nor whereabouts ayme at his adver&s;ary. Being in this &s;traite he was con&s;trai|ned in his iudgment, to place &s;ixe Regiments of his forces, into the Wood neare at hand, where al&s;o he rai&s;ed &s;ome batteries again&s;t us, and the whole day next en&s;uing, did play upon us with &s;ome rea&s;onable earne&s;tne&s;&s;e; in the meane time our forces &s;lept not, but with &s;ome ready pay|ment an&s;wered them. In&s;omuch that notwith&s;tanding they tooke the Wood for their &s;helter, in the up&s;hot a great many dead Corps were left behind them.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday in the Evening, our Army did perceive that <HI>Tilly</HI> drew backe and retyred all his Baggage, and he him|&s;elfe in the night fled and went his wayes with all his Troupes. This morning very early, his Mai. ha&s;tened over the bridge (which ye&s;terday was ready in good conveni|ent time) fir&s;t 300. and afterward 500. hor&s;e more, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ought backe &s;uddainly many pri&s;oners.

<P>On the 2. of Aprill, by a Proclamation it was forbidden in <HI>Aug&s;burgh,</HI> that none of the Inhabitants there &s;hould come abroad out of their hou&s;es: And it was then &s;ignifi|ed by the Magi&s;trate vnto a principall prote&s;tant there, that Generall <HI>O&s;&s;a</HI> had order to come with his Army thi|ther, vnle&s;&s;e the vncatholike Burgers (who ea&s;ily might yeeld to long for, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>) would freely and willingly deliuer vp all their armes, that &s;o a rea&s;onable Garri&s;on might bee a&s;&s;ured of them.
