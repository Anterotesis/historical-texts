<HEAD>A pitiful Relation of the mi&s;era|ble end which a woman made with <HI>her Spou&s;e to whom &s;hee was promi&s;ed,</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT is manife&s;t that mankinde is of its owne nature wicked and giuen to ill, reiecting all manner of good in&s;tructi|ons which are made by the teachers of the Go&s;pell; and among&s;t diuers other vices, wee perceiue by daily experience, that both the rich and poore are bent to pride, although it be repugnant to the holy Scriptures, and forbidden in the &s;ame. It is true, I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e, that many of vs reade &s;ome|times the Scriptures, and harken the Mini&s;ters of the Word of God, with an intention to amend our liues; but alas, we let tho&s;e in&s;tructions more com|monly pa&s;&s;e through our eares as a wind that com|meth at the one doore in, and flieth againe out by another doore or window: wee &s;ee not &s;ooner a wanton eye, or any other wickedne&s;&s;e, but fall a|gaine to our former &s;inne, and thinke no more vpon that which hath bin taught vnto vs. And by rea&s;on of this it happeneth, that God &s;endeth daily many plagues vpon vs, to puni&s;h our &s;innes, and vi&s;iteth vs e&s;pecially with warre, pe&s;tilence and famine. Our mortall Enemy, who runneth continually as a roa|ring
<PB N="2" REF="5">Lion after vs, knowing our wicked inclinations, and that wee make too much of the fle&s;h, &s;eeketh to bring vs into temptations, hoping thereupon to de|&s;troy both our bodies and &s;oules: and e&s;pecially he enticeth vs to pride and vaine glorie, which are none of the le&s;&s;er &s;ins, and a net to catch vs. For we ob&s;erue daily, that many which will flie higher then their wings are able to carry them, come not onely to &s;hame and di&s;credit, but bring their &s;oules al&s;o into great mi&s;eries and vexations; as among&s;t other examples may appeare by this following, which happened lately neere the towne of <HI>Hoey</HI> (lying vp|on the frontiers of <HI>Brabant</HI>) on the per&s;on of a daughter of one <HI>Aert Clae&s;&s;en</HI> an Jnne-keeper, who dwelled without the gate of the &s;ame towne at the &s;igne of the blacke hor&s;e, and had no other children than this daughter, of which he made therefore very much, and &s;pared no co&s;t to adorne her mo&s;t beau|tifull body with &s;uch gay and rich apparell as &s;hee required. She then being apparelled farre aboue her fathers e&s;tate, and &s;et forth as if &s;he were an Earles daughter, grew very proud, and de&s;pi&s;ed all young men and &s;uiters that came to &s;ee her. And it happened afterwards, that both her beautie and &s;pightfulne&s;&s;e or &s;corne being made knowne to the world by them which had lodged at her fathers hou&s;e, &s;ome three rich Merchants of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> ta|king their way towards <HI>Francford,</HI> baited at her fa|thers hou&s;e. One of them being yet a bachelor, and a very hand&s;ome man, was euen at the fir&s;t &s;ight that he had of her inflamed to loue &s;uch a rare beautie:</P>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<P>And not long afterwards, hauing at &s;euerall times beene a &s;uiter vnto her, he got at la&s;t her good will, and tooke the fruits of loue vpon great oathes and promi&s;es made before hand; and went thereupon to her father to get his good liking to the mariage, and &s;poke in this manner: It is now come &s;o far be|twixt your daughter and me, that if it plea&s;eth you we &s;hall be two &s;oules in one bodie: the father li|king the Merchant very well, &s;aid thereupon, None ought to &s;eparate them whom God hath conioy|ned, and therefore if God hath appointed her for you, you &s;hall not want my good will; and added moreouer, that if he would, he might in the pre|&s;ence of his two friends that came with him, make the &s;pou&s;alls &s;ure both by hand and mouth: He li|king this motion very well, tooke pre&s;ently a ring with a <HI>Diamond</HI> from his finger, and gaue it to her &s;aying, Take my mo&s;t beloued, &amp; receiue my faith|full promi&s;e. This being done, her father made a fore-meale of the wedding to fea&s;t the Bride|groome (as is v&s;uall in tho&s;e parts) and his friends. The other two Merchants hauing daily vrged the Bridegroome to di&s;patch his affaires about the wed|ding, that they might aduance their iourney; he tooke his leaue from his &s;pou&s;e, and went thereup|on to her father and mother to doe the like, and de|&s;ired them that they would take great care both for their daughter and her fruit, if &s;he got any; and promi&s;ed them againe, that at his returne from <HI>Franckford</HI> he would come to them backe againe, with an intention to marrie their daughter, and to
<PB N="4" REF="6">carrie her afterwards to <HI>Antwerpe.</HI> After his depar|ture came many &s;trange cogitations in the minde of his deare&s;t, and con&s;idered by her &s;elfe that if the young Merchant her &s;pou&s;e came not backe againe, that &s;he &s;hould be contemned, and blamed all the daies of her life, and that the people would point at her with their fingers and &s;ay, looke, there &s;he go|eth who is now paied for her great pride and &s;pite|fulne&s;&s;e: But e&s;pecially &s;hee troubled her minde, with the&s;e and &s;uch like cogitations. When &s;he &s;aw that the time was expired which he had appointed for his returne, and would not be appea&s;ed by her Parents, who &s;ought to comfort her, &s;aying, Be of a good minde, doe not mi&s;tru&s;t your &s;pou&s;e, he is an hone&s;t man, and will &s;urely come backe againe, as &s;oone as his affaires will giue him leaue. She grow|ing then daily more and more de&s;perate, it happe|ned that &s;he ri&s;ing early on a Munday, put on her be&s;t apparell, and told to her parents with a &s;miling countenance, that &s;he had but little re&s;t the night before, and that &s;he conceiued in her fir&s;t &s;lumbring, that the Merchant &s;hould not come backe againe; but afterwards being againe fallen into a &s;lumber, her minde gaue her that &s;hee &s;hould &s;hortly &s;ee her &s;pou&s;e, and I thinke &s;urely that it &s;hall happen, and am therefore now re&s;olued to walke a little abroad to recreate my &s;elfe. Going abroad &s;hee went to|wards a wood that lay not farre from her fathers hou&s;e, and e&s;pied there a young man comming to her with his rapier on his &s;ide, and &s;he thought that he was her &s;pou&s;e: (But alas &s;he was mightily de|ceiued,
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y">for it was the wicked &s;pirit, who appeared vnto her in his &s;hape and apparell) and bade him welcome with a cheerefull minde: and receiued thereupon a rich &s;carpe which hee &s;aid that hee had brought with him to be&s;tow vpon her; and de&s;ired thereupon that &s;hee would yeeld vnto him her young and delicate bodie, for which he had longed a great while. Shee ea&s;ily yeelding to his &s;uit, went hand in hand with him towards the wood (in which &s;hee yeelded afterwards the v&s;e of her bodie vnto him) and prote&s;ted by the way, that in his ab&s;ence &s;hee had fetcht many heauy groanes for his &s;ake. But hee not being contented with her body, made her al&s;o to yeeld her &s;oule vnto him; and wrung her head from her necke, (as &s;oone as &s;hee had granted his reque&s;t) making the whole wood to tremble and &s;hake: and &s;o made this poore wretch a mo&s;t mi&s;erable end of her life, being de&s;tituted of the feare of God, and onely giuen to pride, vanity, and worldly care. The father, and mother, longing for the returne of their daughter, learned afterwards by a &s;wineheard what was become of her, for he knew her, and had partly heard and &s;eene this mi&s;erable tragedy. They were both at the hearing of this newes much di&s;comforted, and the mother fell pre|&s;ently into a trance. The next day, the young Mer|chant comming backe againe found the Parents of his deare beloued in this heauine&s;&s;e, and asked them where &s;he was; who told him thereupon as well as they could this Hi&s;torie, and told him that for his loues &s;ake &s;he had beene tempted and murdered by
<PB N="6" REF="7" MS="y">the Deuill: he being full of &s;orrow and griefe, went thereupon out of their hou&s;e and hung him&s;elfe out of a de&s;perate minde. The Magi&s;trate hauing heard that which was hapned, &s;ent pre&s;ently the hangman to fetch the body of the Merchant, and cau&s;ed it to be hanged on a gibbet, as is there the cu&s;tome of the land. Concerning her body it was buried vnder the gallowes. Her parents died likewi&s;e within the &s;pace of few daies, being not able to beare &s;uch a heauy griefe. This example may moue vs to pray to God that he will giue vs better mindes, and pre&s;erue vs from all temptation of the wicked.</P>
