That the Air doth al&s;o notwith|&s;tanding the predominancy of the heat abound with moi&s;ture, as al&s;o with a volatile nitrous Salt, prov|ed from the &s;peedy ru&s;ting of Steel and Iron, and the penetrancy and wonderful fructifyiag quality of their rains and dews: hereby putrefaction hindred, hence is it that the heat is &s;o little trouble&s;ome, and that the heat doth not cau&s;e &s;uch thir&s;t as the &s;ame would in <HI>Europe:</HI> from this al&s;o proceeds their be|ing more lax in their Bowels.

<ITEM>An Explication of the Name and Nature of Fevers at large, their &s;everal cau&s;es and various effects. That there's no malignity originally in Fevers at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> though &s;ometimes &s;uperadded by the management of
<PB REF="7">the attendant or Patient for want of due evacuation or exa&s;perating hot remedies. The mo&s;t general and proper Remedies for Fevers in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bleeding and vomiting.

Whence it is that our Fevers u&s;ually intermittent, of which there are divers &s;orts, all which duely manag'd prove &s;imple Tertians, but if interrupted continued. The u&s;e of Cor|dials dangerous, for which divers rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned. The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful and natural Cure is to begin with Emeticks, and then to proceed with Sudorificks, of which latter &s;ort <HI>China</HI> Root plentifully growing in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> is commended and by long and frequent ex|perience approved.

They are u&s;ually after Fluxes Fevers and other Di&s;ea&s;es, where Nature weak and Tran&s;piration le&s;&s;ened and interrupted; as appears in its Cure by &V;nction. A &s;pecifick Remedy for this
<PB REF="8">Di&s;ea&s;e afforded by <HI>Jamaica.</HI> Its de&s;cription called the Dumb Cane, who&s;oever toucheth it with his tongue becoming dumb &s;ome hours after. That 'tis no poy&s;on and might therefore probably be taken inwardly, but the Author applies it only externally. Its preparation and how to be u&s;ed, its odd effects, where occa&s;ionally of the like evacuation cau&s;ed by another plant, very &s;ucce&s;sfully applied in the Pleuri&s;ie.

<LABEL><HI>Chap. VIII.</HI> Of Worms. </LABEL>
<ITEM>Whence Worms &s;o frequent in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and that the per&s;ons chiefly afflicted therewith, are children, wo|men and weakly infirm. Their Symptomes. Occa&s;ion|ed partly by the Air, partly by the Water and Diet, the former being too plentifully impregnated with the Eggs or &s;eminal Principles of In&s;ects: And Bread not being over plentiful the meaner &s;ort feed on Po|tato's and other Roots, which are here accounted ae|quivalent to Bread. The proper Remedies again&s;t Worms are almo&s;t all bitter things, e&s;pecially Reme|dies irradiated with Mercury. The Cure &s;omewhat diver&s;ified by the parts in which the Worms re&s;ide, how to make di&s;covery thereof. Jamaican Aloes or Sempervive variou&s;ly prepared a &s;pecifical Remedy again&s;t Worms: As al&s;o irradiations of Mercury communicated to convenient Vehicles; and &s;ucceed|ed by gentle Purges.

In this Chapter our Author &s;eems to de&s;cribe an Endemial Di&s;ea&s;e pro|per to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> as the Root of the Pox, which latter he accounts an European Di&s;ea&s;e grafted on an Indian, and a&s;cribes unto them different Cures. The Authors Conjecture that many of the Symptomes in the Yaws and Pox, may proceed from minute Ani|mals, confirmed by divers Rea&s;ons and Ob&s;ervations. That the Air of <HI>Jamaica</HI> conduces much to the ea&s;ie and &s;peedy Cure of the Di&s;temper, by Rea&s;on of its nitrous Quality. The Cure of the Pox as &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed in <HI>Jamaica</HI> by a plain methodical Cour&s;e, in which he u&s;ually employs a Bal&s;amical Juice, who&s;e u&s;e fir&s;t di&s;covered by wild Boars, its excellent quali|ties and &s;ignal effects.</ITEM>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE OF THE State of Health IN THE ISLAND OF JAMAICA, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT being my bu&s;ine&s;s, while in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to con&s;ider the Health and attend the Di&s;ea&s;es of the place, it was nece&s;&s;ary to commit what occurred in that af|fair to a more faithful Regi&s;ter than my memory: to the which, that I might better effect my end, I was forced often to recur, and thereby to amend what too ea&s;ily im|po&s;ed
<PB N="2" REF="10">it &s;elf on my credence, or el&s;e what I was more confirmed in, became the better e&s;tabli&s;hment of my practice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Generals, whereto I referred my &s;elf, were the Topicks of <HI>Hippocrates, viz.</HI> the Air, the Place, and the Waters, next the Cu|&s;toms and manners of living: and la&s;tly the con&s;equents of the former, <HI>viz.</HI> the intempe|ratures and Di&s;ea&s;es either peculiar to the Tropicks or mo&s;t u&s;ually found thereabouts all which may not &s;erve barely for &s;pecu|lation but the u&s;e and benefits of the Inhabi|tants, either for their timely preventing or el&s;e curing their incident Maladies. Not as if <HI>Jamaica</HI> were obnoxious to more Di|&s;ea&s;es, and &s;uch more frightful then are el&s;e|where to be found, for the &s;equell will de|mon&s;trate the contrary, but lea&s;t &s;uch as are there, prove more fatal for want of be|ing remarked: and fora&s;much as no one yet hath done that charitable office to his neigh|bour, I cannot without rebuke of my con|&s;cience refu&s;e to become a Samaritan, and by thereto make what rea&s;onable provi&s;ion I may for the comfort and recovery of the af|flicted: for it doth not a little unea&s;ily touch humanity to &s;ee the burthens of nature aggravated by ignorance of remedy, and want of &s;utable a&s;&s;i&s;tances. Neither
<PB N="3" REF="10">is it a little confu&s;ion to be able to do &s;o lit|tle in &s;o de&s;irable a work; however a &s;ingle Talent may not be napkined without guilt, and that not to be expiated without a double diligence. It's true a little labour is more then doubly trouble&s;ome in a hot Country, where the mo&s;t &s;ooner &s;eek the &s;hade, though it be but of an A&s;s, rather than undergo the heat of the day; where|fore to &s;tart any thing that may exerci&s;e in a lazy country, hath this in it of prai&s;e, that it's again&s;t the grain, and manife&s;ts &s;omewhat of &s;elf-denial, at lea&s;t the va|nity of o&s;tentation or humor of &s;cribling can have &s;mall pretences here, where there is &s;o little of gaity offered at. And in a place where Booki&s;hne&s;s is not rea&s;onably to be expect|ed, it may &s;uffice, if relation of matter of fact imploy the more &s;agacious in profita|ble deductions, or that the pre&s;ent truths afford relief to any one afflicted. For it mu&s;t needs be irk&s;ome to have the plea&s;ures of a &s;ummer country, &s;uch as <HI>Jamaica</HI> is, interrupted by indi&s;po&s;itions and want of li&s;t to enjoy what's &s;o plentifully offered. It's pity a rational Creature &s;hould &s;urfeit of di|licacy, and not moderate his inclinations out of good husbandry to enjoy it the longer. but &s;ince appetite is apt to over-rule our rea|&s;ons,
<PB N="4" REF="11">and the de&s;ire of good tempts to the neare&s;t confines of evil, by how much the more de&s;irable the place and clime is, by &s;o much the more need of circum&s;pection: to the which if I might happily awaken my Country-men, I may prevent &s;urpri&s;als, which of all is the greate&s;t evil the Engli&s;h u&s;ually lay open to, through too hardy a cou|rage rather then remi&s;s &s;upinene&s;s: they being too prone to &s;light their lives rather than be curious in their pre&s;ervation; a tem|per happy and agreeable enough to the northern Climes, but un&s;utable to the torrid Zone, where through the great activity of Nature mo&s;t &s;udden changes are effected, a &s;ound health oft precipitated into Di&s;tem|per, and &s;uch Di&s;tempers po&s;ting to the Grave, ere the &s;luggi&s;h ob&s;erver be awake|ned to prevention.

Its heat is the nece&s;&s;a|ry product of the neighbouring Sun, as its moi&s;ture is from that of the Moon; from both flow the beneficial as well as nece&s;|&s;ary Brezes rendring the Air different from any on the other &s;ide the Tropicks, and therefore differently to be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of Health and Di&s;ea&s;es. Though the wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, yet it's in general &s;omewhat regular, and ob&s;erves its times, and keeps or makes its &s;ea&s;ons, no one who&s;e ob&s;ervance hath been but &s;light, can ea&s;ily doubt: For whil&s;t the Sun by its direct Rayes threatens mo&s;t to parch, then (as there is mo&s;t need thereof) the more
<PB N="6" REF="12">forcible Brezes fan mo&s;t: wherefore I &s;tick not to conclude the Sun to be the ap|parent cau&s;e of the brisk moving Air, or daily Sea Brezes, thereby rendring <HI>Apollo</HI> opportunely &s;ollicitous of the health of his mo&s;t immediate &s;ubjects by &s;o rea&s;onable provi&s;ion therefore. For of nece&s;&s;ity all things mu&s;t be &s;uffocated and dy between the Tropicks, did not the extraordinary heat generate the extraordinary winds to give a &s;utable &s;upply of often to be chan|ged breath, ventilating our Lungs with renovating changes of fre&s;her air. Which happy effect though it acknowledge the Sun as its male parent, requires al&s;o as preg|nant a Womb of receptive moi&s;ture to bring forth the happy and nece&s;&s;ary Brezes: whereto the Moon, as a handy Midwife to Nature, mo&s;t readily affords a&s;&s;i&s;tances, not only from her own moi&s;t Rayes, but by the &s;ignal power on the Ocean, where unloo|&s;ing the clo&s;e &s;aline Bonds of the briny Main, &s;he adapts thereby the parts vola|tile for a daily flight, as oft as the urging Sun &s;timulates the nece&s;&s;ary &s;uccour of the cooling Brezes. But Brezes or mo|ving Air being twofold, and generally pro|ducing different effects, as well as they have different times of their blowing, force us to
<PB N="7" REF="12">a&s;&s;ign a different cau&s;e of their productive originals. For as the Moon by loo&s;ing the &s;aline Bonds of the Sea (which is demon|&s;tratively to be proved it doth) affords daily matter for the &s;ea Brezes: So the &s;tagnated Air, harbouring in mountainous Caverns and woody confinements, actuated by the night lights and &s;tarry influences, admini&s;ter &s;ufficient matter for the night winds called the land <HI>Brezes,</HI> both which differently impre&s;s in point of Health: For as the Sea Brezes partaking of the uni|ver&s;al vivifying &s;aline nature are found to be mo&s;t healthful and agreeable to life, as re&s;i&s;ting and defending from putrefaction; &s;o the &s;tagnated Air impregnated by mine|ral <HI>Gas</HI> and the &s;till variable Moon, never cea&s;eth to incline to alterative changes, and &s;uch as &s;avour of putrefaction and death: wherefore from their cau&s;e, as well as we find by experience, I conclude, the two Brezes re&s;pect health variou&s;ly: The &s;olar and &s;aline ones mo&s;t concurring to health, as the Lunar and putrefactive ones do to death and di&s;&s;olution. From the latter &s;pring the great encrea&s;e and multiplica|tions in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as from the former the worth and vigor of their product, both Brezes &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary from their cau&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="13">and to their ends, and a virtue is to be made of &s;uch as well as a nece&s;&s;ity entails them on the Places where they are found; betwixt both the Air is almo&s;t al|ways kept in motion, which otherwi&s;e through its great heat and moi&s;ture mu&s;t egregiou&s;ly putrefy, and thence rather hatch the plagues of <HI>Egypt,</HI> producing In|fects and &s;uch like generations, in&s;tead of more noble and perfect animals.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of Day and Night being &s;more equal throughout the year than in <HI>Europe,</HI> divides the &s;ea&s;ons of tho&s;e two &s;ort of Brezes more equally, al&s;o they generally have neer twelve hours for their interchangeable blowings, though &s;ome|times they may borrow of each other, <HI>viz.</HI> the Land Brezes intrench on the time of the Sea's, as the Sea Brezes do &s;ometimes on the u&s;ual time of the land Bre|zes: Be&s;ides the &s;ea&s;ons of the norths which much alter the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the Winds as well as of health. The&s;e norths are &s;mart winds and cold, blowing from off the land with unu&s;ual force and continuance, being particular not general winds, either from the mountainous Tracts of <HI>Jamaica</HI> it &s;elf, and then only to be felt on the &s;outh &s;ide, and not far to Sea, or el&s;e ari&s;ing from
<PB N="9" REF="13"><HI>Cuba,</HI> and then chiefly if not only remar|ked on the North &s;ide of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> But yet &s;ometimes &s;o &s;trong as to excite the &s;ame effort of winds in the mountainous pa&s;&s;ages, where being increa&s;ed, it's propa|gated to the South, and becomes a thorow and &s;evere North to the whole I&s;land and neighbourhood of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which comes neere&s;t to the windward I&s;land tumultua|ting Haricanoes, but never one quarter &s;o mutinous or afflicting. The u&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons of the Norths is while the Sun is mo&s;t re|mote in its <HI>Capricorn</HI> progre&s;s: For then the cold umbrages of the mountains have be&s;t opportunities to &s;ally forth, while the over-ruling <HI>Phoebus</HI> is mo&s;t ab&s;ent with his &s;trong &s;ea Brezes: The &s;ea&s;on of the&s;e Norths is mo&s;t fruitful in the cruciating Belly ach, and e&s;pecially it endangers &s;uch who have been once afflicted therewith, likewi&s;e &s;ore Eyes, &s;ore Throats, and Tertians take oft this time of a&s;&s;aulting di&s;po&s;ed Bodies,</P>
<P>But to return to our mo&s;t u&s;ual and or|derly diurnal and nocturnal Brezes, the better to defend from the latter as well as rejoyce in the former, be&s;ides what hath been &s;aid to both as to their effective originals, in their evident qualities
<PB N="10" REF="14">va&s;tly differ: for the land Brezes have a far more &s;en&s;ible chilline&s;s than tho&s;e from the Sea; the general occa&s;ion as to the Air of the Tertian and Quartan Agues: for while the pores by daily Sweating or in&s;en&s;ible tran&s;pirations are egregiou&s;ly open, the &s;uddain change of the land Brezes &s;urpri&s;ing the open Pores ea&s;ily invade the di&s;po&s;ed body with an agui&s;h Inclina|tion, Nature being &s;en&s;ible of her intruding Enemy oft violently &s;huts and keeps too too clo&s;e the outlets of the skin, unadvi&s;edly im|pri&s;oning what ought be di&s;charged: hence the pri&s;oners become a four ferment to the Juices of the whole body, fir&s;t &s;hivering and chilling the extream parts, and after in|flaming the whole in a hot paroxy&s;m; of which more under our Chapter of Di&s;ea&s;es. It may not be improper to remark, that tho&s;e Brezes of the night do le&s;s injury to new comers from the colder <HI>Europe,</HI> than to the more antient inhabitants, who&s;e pores be|ing as it were moulded into the bore of the Indian Air, are of larger &s;ize and more re|ceptive of the chilling Brezes than &s;uch as come from the northern parts: hence al&s;o &s;uch as pa&s;s directly out of <HI>Europe</HI> hither are not &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;&s;aulted with fevori&s;h attracts as tho&s;e from the <HI>Carib</HI> I&s;les: for
<PB N="11" REF="14">tho&s;e little tracts of land of <HI>Barbadoes, Nevis, Mon&s;erat, &amp;c.</HI> being well opened, and therefore affording nothing &s;o much of night Brezes as the large woody mountains of <HI>Jamaica</HI> do, hath not inured them there|to, while their greater diurnal heat hath &s;uf|ficiently di&s;po&s;ed them to a mo&s;t ready re|ception of the night cold Invaders, of which more under the head of place. Let's here make &s;ome further progre&s;s, though on this airy Subject, and con&s;ider next it's thickne&s;s and moi&s;ture. That active heat rarefyes and thins, is very true; and therefore it may &s;eem a Paradox, to a&s;&s;ert the Air of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to be eminently thick, while the Clime is &s;o hot: but yet that <HI>de facto</HI> it is &s;o, and for great rea&s;on mu&s;t be &s;o, it behoves me to evince. Air as Air, in its &s;elf and with|out additional mixtures, is to a proverb thin: &s;o that to enquire into its fir&s;t e&s;&s;entialls or quiddity ought to afford but a jejune noti|on; yet as it cau&s;eth real effects, and carri|eth &s;o great a &s;hare of the mo&s;t manife&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions of the Univer&s;e, it ought not to be neglected in a phy&s;ical enquiry. Every one breathing knows or feels what's meant by the word; and as it hath generally been e|&s;teemed an element, it admits of no compo|&s;ing mixture. But &s;ince it is demon&s;trated of
<PB N="12" REF="15">late, to have great ela&s;ticity or central Spring of its motion, which alwayes ari&s;eth from centration, or contraction of &s;ome|what, I con&s;ider it therefore as a mo&s;t thin ve&s;t or mantle of gro&s;&s;er bodies, without which our &s;en&s;es can act on nothing; and the which, as it's variou&s;ly altered and changed by diver&s;ities and accumulations of bodies, becomes differently beneficial or noxious to life: but as in it &s;elf not &s;tuff|ed out with gro&s;&s;er bodies, it may well be apprehended as contracting and &s;hrinking into its &s;elf: hence rea&s;onably it may be mo&s;t cold, and a general cooler: when there|fore it's &s;en&s;ibly hot, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be thick, and from the great re&s;i&s;tance of its in|mates be di&s;po&s;ed to quicke&s;t motion, or without &s;uch motion it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;olve into putrefaction, and break up the old man&s;ion for a newer dre&s;s or outward ap|pearance. It may not be without &s;ome pro|bable &s;hew, that from this Ela&s;ticity of the Air, when refined and &s;eparated through the porous Lungs, that the <HI>Sy&s;tole,</HI> or con|tracting power of the heart may fir&s;t be put into act, and that then the heart from its concentrated heat may be pu&s;hed into its <HI>Dia&s;tole</HI> or enlargement, &s;o beginning and and &s;o continuing our vital motions from
<PB N="13" REF="15">the &s;ame &s;prings that give motion to the greater World. But to run that Ela&s;ticity to its fir&s;t cau&s;e and the heat to its, would tran&s;port me into improper &s;ugge&s;tions for this place, and therefore at lea&s;t now I &s;hall be content to take them both as I find them, <HI>viz.</HI> as they two con&s;titute the <HI>Ja|maica</HI> thick, yet brisk moving Air. There remains yet another nece&s;&s;ary quality <HI>viz.</HI> that of Moi&s;ture: for thick and hot mu&s;t be too har&s;h for life without &s;oftning moi&s;ture. Male qualities can never be be|nign enough without amorous mixtures of Female &s;oftne&s;s; <HI>thus Male and Female cre|ated he them, and they repleni&s;hed the earth,</HI> The Air of <HI>Jamaica</HI> is eminent herein, and therefore mo&s;t agreeable to women, be|nificial to their living, incuding their con|ceptions and facilitating their Births: but yet not &s;o far impregnating, as if they, like the Spani&s;h Ginnets, might be impre&s;|&s;ed by the Wind to a fruitfulne&s;s, without the Airine&s;s of a Male con&s;ort.</P>
<P>It's evident, maugre the fal&s;e reports of the de&s;igning Spaniard concerning <HI>Jamai|ca,</HI> that it abounds with Children, as who &s;o when he lands at Port- Royal, may convince him&s;elf at the ea&s;ie rate of his fir&s;t &s;ight. It's true, among &s;o great a crowd of
<PB N="14" REF="16">young many will drop, as all the world over, ere they arrive their riper age. The moi&s;ture of their infant &s;tate complying with that of the air mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily breed worms, which is almo&s;t the whole of e|vil, ordinarily be&s;iegeth children to their hazard; of which in its more proper place. That the Air here is egregiou&s;ly moi&s;t, the very keys in our pockets will ea&s;ily o|pen and demon&s;trate its truth, and that moi&s;ture is not only &s;uch, but notoriou&s;ly nitrous; hence it may well work on mi|neral bodies and corrode them with ru&s;t, as we &s;ee it doth. The great quantities of &s;alt-Peter brought into <HI>Europe</HI> from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> evinceth its great &s;tore to be found in &s;uch like hot Countries as they are, and every way to be equalled by the We&s;t in all &s;uch products: from the &s;ame cau&s;e of abounding nitrous parts in the Air, our Rains are &s;o fruitful and our Dews &s;o va&s;tly penetrating, that they equal if not out-do that of Snow water.</P>
<P>Hence it is, the moi&s;ture of our Air is not &s;o putrefactive as might be expected from its heat and moi&s;ture, did not its Ni|tre eminently &s;ea&s;on it with a &s;aline pre|&s;ervation. Neither yet doth our heat cau&s;e &s;uch thir&s;t as the &s;ame would of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="15" REF="16">in <HI>Europe:</HI> Fora&s;much as the ni|trous Air re&s;olving clammy thicknings and furrings of our mouths, an&s;wers one end of moi&s;ture, and con&s;equently prevents thir&s;tings: From the &s;ame cau&s;e generally our bellies are more open and lax to the daily di&s;charge of excrementions Bur|thens.</P>
<P>It may not be improper being fallen in|to this nitrous account of the Air, to &s;peak &s;omething of that thundering &s;alt, which hath made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the world, e&s;|pecially &s;ince the invention of Gunpow|der, who&s;e principal ingredient being Ni|tre, hath brought it into daily remark as well as into greater u&s;e: Nitre therefore, to de&s;cribe it, and make good the de&s;crip|tion by experiments, is to every ones ta&s;te a cooling Salt, to every ones experience volatile and greatly penetrating, therefore clean&s;ing and &s;couring, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a re|markable Sulphur and an internal bitter|ne&s;s. All which &s;en&s;ible qualities point at its being and compo&s;itions, which Na|ture elaborates from various &s;ubjects, on which art it &s;elf in &s;ome mo&s;t happily imitates. That all Air hath nitrous parts, though &s;ome far more then others, is no difficult belief: but how it comes by &s;uch
<PB N="16" REF="17">is nothing &s;o ea&s;ily to be evinced. The mo&s;t eminent di&s;po&s;er of our vi&s;ible heat is the Sun, all light contracted proves hot, and the extremity thereof Fire, the pa&s;&s;age or <HI>medium</HI> of light from its great Source to the earth is &s;oft yeilding Air; and that already hath been &s;aid to be a contracting ve&s;t of Bodies, and therefore it will not be hard to apprehend how it may invellope and gra&s;p to it &s;elf warm Particles of light, and thereby give being to this univer&s;al inmate, <HI>viz.</HI> the Nitre of the Air which while but lightly tinctu|red manife&s;ts but little thereof, but through daily renovations of the &s;ame action grows &s;atiate, and falls by its own weight to the ground: Be&s;ides, from the Earth, and emi|nantly from the Sea, the united reboun|ding heat a&s;cending its neere&s;t air there|in is captivated, and fa&s;hioned into this new form of nitrous Salt; and to conclude this deviation, the Sea &s;alt it &s;elf, though &s;o egregiou&s;ly fixed, that Fire moves it little, even that is wholly converted into pure Nitre and a fixed in&s;ipid Earth, as by undoubted experience I have evinced to my &s;elf: So then for our great heat between the Tropicks, the moi&s;ture of the air and our neerne&s;s in <HI>Jamaica</HI> to the &s;ur|rounding
<PB N="17" REF="17">Sea: We cannot but expect, as we find our Air to be very nitrous, thence penetrating and thence cooling, aver&s;e in its nature to the coagulating &s;tone, in hu|mane Body a good defence and &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;corbutick affects, a true cooling Febrifuge. Hence our Fevers arerarely continued but generally intermitted ones, of which el&s;e where, hence to conclude this Chapter of the air of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the contagious plague is well and maturely prohibited inhabiting our Air, the which, to &s;umm up all, is vifying hot, and multi|plyingly moi&s;t, incorporating thick, and &s;pirituou&s;ly brisk and moving, by its ni|tro&s;ity piercing and clean&s;ing, in all mo&s;t proper to increa&s;e life, &s;utable to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the place.</P>

<P><HI>JAmaica</HI> being an I&s;land of its peculiar Form, &s;cituated in the degrees of 17.29. with its references to its neighbou|ring I&s;lands and the South Continent be|ing variou&s;ly lyable to Currents, to Norths, South's, and South-we&s;t Winds. Its diur|nal and nocturnal Brezes affords peculiar con&s;iderations, both as to &s;ea&s;ons and &s;tates of health.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t as it is an I&s;land, 'tis more &s;utable to I&s;landers; as to its form, it &s;eems fitted for the re&s;i&s;tance of Hariconoes, to which this I&s;land hath not yet been, and I pre|&s;ume never may be &s;ubject: For the whole is a long narrow Tract of land, &s;welling in the mid&s;t into the continued heights of mountains, running from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t: whereby the north Winds become divided from the South, and the Ea&s;t and We&s;t are both wedged a&s;under to the di|minution of their force, from the figure
<PB N="19" REF="18">of the place. Therefore it becomes le&s;s lyable, if not wholly free, from tho&s;e de|&s;tructive tumults of huddling winds, which de&s;olate &s;ometimes and always at the &s;ea&s;ons of their blowings affright other the le&s;&s;er I&s;lands: The figure of this I&s;land re&s;embles mo&s;t a Saddle or many Saddles, the mo&s;t inhabited and planted places are the plainer skirts and de&s;cents, as mo&s;t neer the exporting and importing places of the I&s;land. Yet the more remote moun|tains are not without their eminent de&s;ira|blene&s;s, as being generally be&s;t wooded and watered, and when opened, mo&s;t whol&s;ome and agreeable, plea&s;ant to the Engli&s;h Temperament, as being cooler and the Air thinner: Be&s;ides the mould is mo&s;t unctuous and fruitful, having been a long time defended and &s;haded by its mighty Bowers, from the fierce Rapes of the fiery <HI>Phaebus.</HI> The coolne&s;s of the moun|tainous tracts &s;o va&s;tly differing from the hotter neighbouring confines of the Sea, render health more difficultly to be pre|&s;erved in tho&s;e who pa&s;s immediately from one to the other, but that is for want of due advertency of one and the other place, and &s;utable provi&s;ion for that change, which hereafter I &s;hall &s;ufficiently
<PB N="20" REF="19">remark, having experienced the &s;ame &s;ufficiently on my &s;elf, to my &s;atisfaction and &s;afety: after fir&s;t having &s;uffered in &s;uch a travel, by the inva&s;ion of a &s;evere Tertian. But to return to the more inha|bited parts of this I&s;land, and to &s;alute our new Comers at the mo&s;t eminent place of Port-Royal, which is &s;eated on the &s;outh &s;ide of the I&s;land, in the degrees 17.29. On the end of a long &s;pit of &s;andy Land, after it having run twelve miles from the Mountains foot into the Sea, fra|ming with other mo&s;t admirable helps of the &s;alt Pond, Mountains covert, the in|comparable Land lockt Harbour mo&s;t pro|perly &s;tiled Port Royal, a place as agreea|bly &s;eated for health and whol&s;ome air, a for exportations and importations and de|fence. The latter being more proper for others on &s;utable occa&s;ions, to expatiate on, I leave the healthy part to our pre&s;ent remarks, and therein matter of Fact hath &s;ufficiently convinced me for nigh five years, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s thereof bids fair to &s;ecure for the future. For the &s;alt Wa|ter wa&s;hing it on both &s;ides with the great pre&s;ervative and bal&s;amick friend of life, defends from putrefactive inclin|tion, neither yet renders &s;uch a place in|cident
<PB N="21" REF="19">to the Scurvy (as u&s;ually in cold northern Climes 'tis wont) for here the mo&s;t fixed &s;ea Salt through the nature of the Heat, Air, and heavenly <HI>Blas,</HI> is rea|dily volatilized, and thereby cures in &s;tead of cau&s;ing &s;corbutick affects. This Spirit of Salt relieves what the fixed Salt inflicts in our northern Sea confines, of this well &s;ea&s;oned Air Port-Royal partakes doub|ly for any other part of the I&s;land, becau&s;e &s;eated in the mid&s;t of this pre&s;erving pi|kle: So that when the land Brezes reach this place, they mu&s;t needs be fir&s;t blen|ded with the well leavening Air of the Har|bour it &s;elf, whereby its noxiou&s;ne&s;s be|comes well corrected and far le&s;s injuri|ous. Be&s;ides, the nature of this &s;andy tract is &s;uch, as well to concur with its whol&s;om air, for it's eminently dry, and thereby an imbiber of the greate&s;t rains, leaving no &s;tagnating Water to putrefy and corrupt the Air, thus the &s;teril Sands become occa&s;ionally fruitful in healthfulne&s;s. And what is not &s;o proper for Herbage is more happy in being agreeable to humane Na|ture, and for propagating the Stock of <HI>A|dam</HI> with the fir&s;t &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>increa&s;e and multiply.</HI> But I mu&s;t not dwell too long in one place, having &s;o much to touch at, e|&s;pecially
<PB N="22" REF="20">the fair <HI>Ligania</HI> inviting their gree|dy eye to a pre&s;ent inquiry. This compact &s;ettlement is joyn'd by its mountains Ea&s;terly to the fir&s;t runnings out of our extended &s;an|dy tract, whereof Port-Royal graces as well as defends the one end, and the&s;e Mountains the other, which &s;eem to make one point of a Bow, for &s;uch a figure be&s;t explicates <HI>Ligania.</HI> May it always abide in its &s;trength, projecting its numerous &s;hafts as their <HI>Decus</HI> and <HI>Tutamen</HI> of the whole I&s;land: the &s;tring of this lovely Bow is the mo&s;t convenient Harbour of Port Royall, from whence the expatiating levell Land and large <HI>Savan|nas</HI> crowd backward the &s;welling Mountains many a fair Mile, affording a mo&s;t benign Seat to numerous &s;ettlements: this plea&s;ant tract is well advanced by its &s;weeter profit, while it unlades it &s;elf of great quantities of the be&s;t Sugar; and that &s;o ea&s;ily as to di&s;&s;olve little by its transporting charge, which con|ducing to its plentifull accommodations, and being thus nigh, daily &s;upplies of conve|niencies render <HI>Ligania</HI> to be a mo&s;t grate|ful and healthy place: the North we&s;t end whereof affords the other point of our Bow directing a further journey: for there the parting River of <HI>de Coure</HI> remembers us of <HI>St. Jago de la viega</HI> &s;eated on the &s;ide
<PB N="23" REF="20">of the &s;ame about &s;ix Miles from the Har|bour. It is this River which &s;upplies the dayly drink of the Port, as well as its more neighbouring place, called Pa&s;&s;age Fort, the fair hopefull beginning of a larger Town, di&s;tant from Port Royall about two leagues, quickly pa&s;&s;ed over by the delight|full as well as the convenient tran&s;ports of <HI>Jamaica</HI> built Wherries, whereof many a &s;core plying both on the one &s;ide and the other &s;ide admini&s;ter every way &s;utable convenience of mo&s;t ready Communicati|on. Thus we bring our new Comer from the &s;andy point to the more apparent <HI>Terra ferma</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where I being in&s;tead of a <HI>Mercury</HI> to the unacquainted, I cannot but tell him once for all, that this place as well as all our immediate bordering places on the &s;ea round the whole I&s;land are more proper for the well inured <HI>Jamaica</HI> Man than any later arrived per&s;ons: for the Air here as well as the water are rarely &s;o good as more high in the well opened Country. Let's therefore being welcome here, pa&s;s on our mo&s;t plea&s;ant Road to the Town of St. <HI>Jago</HI> a very fair Town, through the enlarge|ment of many &s;treets beautified with di|vers Churches and regular Buildings, while it was the Re&s;idence of the lazy Spaniards, who here contented them&s;elves with ea&s;ie
<PB N="24" REF="21">plea&s;ure, comitted their planting to the care of their &s;laving Negro's: whereas now their more indu&s;trious &s;ucce&s;&s;ors live more &s;prin|kled abroad, wheree're their thriving con|cerns require the pre&s;ence of the Ma&s;ter, lea|ving this Town more thinly dwelt in, having fir&s;t been much &s;poiled by the conquering Army or ruinous neglects &s;ince. However there remains yet a good &s;eat for a large Town, being well accommodated with a free open Air, from the wide <HI>Savanna</HI> wherein it's plac'd, &s;upplied with water from the Ri|ver <HI>de Coure</HI> running by its &s;ide, furni&s;hed plentifull with the gra&s;ing Herds and Flocks, &s;porting in its view, though &s;ome|times forced to go further a Field for their daily Food, the &s;oyl having &s;o long lay open to the &s;terilating Sun, it mu&s;t needs be dry and afford more health to the Inhabitants of the Town than plenty of Herbage to their gra&s;ing Cattle. But the large quantity of their far extending <HI>Savannaes,</HI> and the skirts of woods well &s;upply the &s;hortne&s;s of their gra&s;s, in their dry times generally affording Milk for their Babes and good fle&s;h for their &s;tronger men. This Town being well &s;eated both for health and the conveniency of the whole I&s;land, becomes the place of

After which I need &s;ay nothing more for St. <HI>Jago de viega</HI> but pa&s;s on in our plea&s;ant <HI>Savan|naes</HI> or Indian, Fields (for &s;uch the&s;e <HI>Savan|naes</HI> are conjectured to have been) and while we journey, refre&s;h our &s;ight &s;ome|times with the numerous herds of larger oxen, in who&s;e labour there is profit, &s;ome|times with the &s;porting of the wanton Calves, and delight our ears with the &s;weet breathed Cowes, who&s;e lowings echoing make Rural mu&s;ick, delightfull at lea&s;t to the happy owners who&s;e dwellings ever now and then &s;alute the pa&s;&s;engers with their innocent a&s;pects: and by this time <HI>viz.</HI> of an hour we are arrived the Bridge, emi|nent for it's remarkable good water; and here we mu&s;t needs drink, as Cu&s;tome is, and by drinking commend the &s;ame, as the be&s;t of any River water in <HI>Jamaica.</HI> When pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge, we &s;till continue in o|pen Air <HI>Savannaes,</HI> where jogging on we are &s;till affected as before with the brutal Crowa, and &s;oon after &s;urprized with more

For here Nature her &s;elf is prodigal in the number and big|ne&s;s of her rocky Tablets, heaped one on the other to a portentous crowd of the up|rear'd &s;tructure, as if the Giants of old had here begun their work of invading the <HI>Em|pyraeum.</HI> And le&s;t the horror of the&s;e daring Rocks affright too much by their threat|ning Imminency, Mother Nature hath

<P>HOw nece&s;&s;ary Water is to life, and how differences of water do vari|ou&s;ly affect the life not only of the vegeta|tive, but of the breathing world, though readily it will be confe&s;&s;ed, yet oft it's le&s;s con&s;idered than the improvement of &s;uch an object may well require at our hands: E&s;pecially in tho&s;e places where water is the common drink of the mo&s;t, as well as the mo&s;t proper for all. To &s;earch out the fountains of the deep, and enquire after the original Source of waters may &s;eem an extravagancy as well as too needle&s;s a Re|tro&s;pect; yet fora&s;much as the inqui&s;itive mind is never &s;atisfied without it a&s;cend to the fir&s;t cau&s;e of things, and even the fir&s;t as &s;uch intimates a principle yet prior to the cau&s;e, I pre&s;ume to gue&s;s at the princi|pations of waters, and thence a&s;&s;ign them one of the fir&s;t appearing cau&s;es or mat|ter of all vi&s;ibles, and therefore not to be

For he not only as enlightened <HI>by the Candle of the Lord</HI> with other men: But as a&s;cen|ding into the Mount, and by the &s;pecial light of the burning Bu&s;h, peeping neere&s;t into the thick darkne&s;s, thence knew how to commence the generations of the Heavens and the Earth; for darkne&s;s was fir&s;t on the face of the Deep: Not dark|ne&s;s as a privation of light, becau&s;e it was fir&s;t but darkne&s;s as a fit &s;heath to en&s;hrine the after to be produced light: Darkne&s;s as the curdling power and confining Ta|bernacle of the fir&s;t breath, or going forth of the Almighty: Thus he makes darkne&s;s his Pavilion, and characterizeth his other|wi&s;e unintilligible Word to the modes and mea&s;ures of after to be created Beings, fit|ted to take in by piece meal, what was im|po&s;&s;ible in the whole to be apprehended, therefore the Spirit of God is &s;aid to move fir&s;t on the Face of the waters: The Spi|rit cannot move without the Word, nor the Word without Light, nor the Light be
<PB N="41" REF="29">apprehen&s;ible but by a confinement or ter|mination which is darkne&s;s on the face of the Deep, or on the face of the waters, which is all one and the &s;ame: For the face of the waters, <HI>viz.</HI> the external term thereof, being nothing but darkne&s;s, was ere the waters were brought forth, for the Waters being creatures were made by his word, and his fir&s;t word was <HI>Let there be light,</HI> where, but in the darkne&s;s, which being the <HI>Horizon,</HI> the confinement, the vale of the light, and that light being ac|cording to true weight and mea&s;ure adju&s;t|ed to its covering ve&s;t, make the fir&s;t pure fluid.

<P>Hence all our knowledge in and of this World may well be &s;aid to be as in a mirror darkly, and that not tropically only but truly and naturally, for the nature of all created Beings taking their Source hence, <HI>viz.</HI> from the originating waters, all we &s;ee is truly and radically in each thing, nay all that becomes communicative any wi&s;e to our &s;upply, fir&s;t expands it &s;elf towards

<PB N="43" REF="30">to humane life and health, from its great diver&s;ity of Allays and corrup|tions, my duty is to remark the good, and and characterize the le&s;s good, or directly noxious, or at lea&s;t &s;timulate others to do it better. The mo&s;t general allowed Te&s;t of waters is their lightne&s;s, of which the be&s;t partakes mo&s;t: Whereby all mineral wa|ters, though never &s;o limpid are fir&s;t to be excepted again&s;t, at lea&s;t in the way of nouri&s;hment, though not as to medicinal effects. Sometimes de&s;irable mountanous places, &s;uch as <HI>Jamaica,</HI> hide in their tee|ming Bellies &s;tore of the &s;ubjects of the mineral Kingdome, and therefore the wa|ters i&s;&s;uing thence are fir&s;t to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, hence the fir&s;t &s;ettling Spaniards named the River that pa&s;&s;es by the Town of St. <HI>Jago Rio de Coure,</HI> or the Copper River, being it is tainted with i&s;&s;uings forth of &s;ome or many Copper Mines, chiefly di&s;cernable in the time of Floods and Fre&s;hes, when the mountainous Rain wa&s;h down the Creeks and Guts, in the otherwi&s;e whol&s;ome Current, at which times the prudent Spaniard drank not thereof, nor at other times, without fir&s;t &s;ettling the &s;ame in Jars, whereby the mineral <HI>Ocra</HI> had time to &s;ub&s;ide and &s;epa|rate
<PB N="44" REF="31">the vomitive virtue from their drink, which laudable cu&s;tome continues to their Succe&s;&s;ors, who generally take up the next days water in the precedent evening, which while the carele&s;s neglect, they oft pay for it to their &s;orrow, though they con|&s;ider le&s;s the cau&s;e thereof than the im|portance requires. This &s;ame River after having run &s;ome purging miles becomes the u&s;ual drink of Port-Royal, for the mo&s;t part more whol&s;ome there than at the Town of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> becau&s;e by its cur|rent more defaecated from its mineral In|mate, which demon&s;tration of weight will ea&s;ily evince to the curious, not but that even this water brings &s;ometimes its taint with it to the Port, through the di&s;charge of the many &s;alt Springs neer Cabbage Tree bottome, and the neighbouring pla|ces, of which my curio&s;ity hath prompted me to ta&s;te; but then being casked up (for &s;o our water is conveyed to the Point) and &s;tanding &s;ometimes in its new Inclo&s;ure, ere we drink thereof, give's time to the &s;ub&s;iding alien: The care remains that the Cask be always well wa&s;hed when the &s;upplies of water are required in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el, otherwi&s;e the mineral <HI>Ocra</HI> may contaminate the latter received Te|nent,
<PB N="45" REF="31">continuing the alien taint till it be imbibed by the drinkers, who unknow|ingly all on a &s;uddain fall into Fluxes and Gripes, e&s;pecially new Comers who not yet u&s;ed thereto are much affected thereby, nay the country planters coming rarely to the Point, &s;uffer oft the like from the &s;ame cau&s;e: To avoid all which both at St. <HI>Ja|go</HI> and the Port, it were much to be de&s;i|red that both one and the other would &s;up|ply them&s;elves with water el&s;ewhere, <HI>viz.</HI> that they of the Town would be at the trou|ble as the wi&s;er Spaniards were to fetch their water from the Bridge, from the Ri|ver called the black River, and they of the Point from the Rock (a place &s;o termed neer the Harbour) both which afford &s;ig|nally good water. As for the Well waters where&s;oever they are u&s;ed, as too frequent they are e&s;pecially in <HI>Ligania,</HI> they are found too heavy for our nece&s;&s;ary brisk circulation of Blood, be&s;ides their remain|ing gro&s;&s;er parts prove oft ob&s;tructive in|mates, admini&s;tring too frequent occa&s;ions of our dry Bellyach and Drop&s;ies. Pond water as either ari&s;ing from higher Springs or containing Rain water, both farther concocted of the Heavens, makes a more whol&s;ome than delightful water; yet
<PB N="46" REF="32">&s;uch as is mo&s;t fit for brewing our cold drinks (as they call them) with being mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptive of a fermenting power to work and thereby render them more whol&s;ome. Providence hath plentifully watered this I&s;land with great variety of copious Rivers, be&s;ides le&s;&s;er Springs almo&s;t every where to be found, but more in the mountanous than valy Land. And &s;uch affording more whol&s;ome drink by how much the higher the a&s;cent of &s;uch is, hence though we mount not without &s;ome &s;training diffi|culty the a&s;piring heights of Hills, we are well recompenced by the excellency of the water, u&s;ually found there more cleer, more pure, and far cooler, truly &s;lacking and not exa&s;perating, as &s;ome waters do, the deceived thir&s;t: for on &s;uch Eminen|ces the water is u&s;ually be&s;t dige&s;ted and &s;eparated from injurious aliens (e&s;pecially there no mineral Taints are blended there|with) &s;uch are mo&s;t u&s;ually met with in their de&s;cending traces, not in the fir&s;t ruptions on the tops of mountains: for there|to mineral waters cannot well a&s;pire, for their depre&s;&s;ing weight hurries &s;uch to their more proper place, and brings them to the mouths of the lazy, who not taking pains for the be&s;t mu&s;t be contented with
<PB N="47" REF="32">the wor&s;er. <HI>Sed quis a&s;cendet in montem Domini,</HI> he alone is &s;ecure of the true na|tural waters of life which in their pure vi|tality promi&s;e length of days and clarity of Spirits.

<HEAD>CHAP. 4. <HI>Of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of living.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe con&s;ideration of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of living, is no way an a|lien &s;peculation from our &s;cope of de|&s;ired health, but the neglect thereof often much contributes to diver&s;e Intempera|tures, undavi&s;edly drawn on our&s;elves, for the want of &s;ub&s;tituting new Indian ones in the place of our proper native man|ners and u&s;ages in living. I confe&s;s it is deeply natural, where ere we are, to adhere to our earlie&s;t implanted inclinations, wherefore though we change our place we &s;eem loth to change our ingeny, but needs, though with le&s;s rea&s;on than's fit, we tran&s;port northern chilly propen&s;ities, and cu&s;toms thereon depending, into the &s;outhern hot Climes, and mo&s;t improper and de&s;tructive to health, at lea&s;t long life: we retain our ancient Engli&s;h humor (mo&s;t de&s;irable in its proper place) as to eating
<PB N="51" REF="34">and drinking, and other the acts of Na|ture no way to be neglected or perhaps dimini&s;hed, only in an order &s;utable to the change of the place, to be better hus|banded for the vigor of Nature and pro|longing of Life. The quantity, times, and quality of our Engli&s;h Drink and Food, ought, according to the be&s;t of my rea&s;on, to be wholly changed for other more na|tural and agreeable to the clime and cir|cum&s;tances of living. As for the quan|tity we neither ought to eat &s;o much or &s;o little as may well agree in <HI>England,</HI> for exce&s;s in either cannot &s;o &s;uddain threaten life there as here, for Nature is not &s;o yare with her delinquents in the cold northern Tracts as between the Tropicks, where all motions being nece&s;&s;arily more quick, the puni&s;hment of all Intemperances afford le&s;s time for Repentance: the quantity therefore ought to be le&s;ned one way and increa&s;ed another, <HI>i.e.</HI> we may well eat more at more times and le&s;s at each, where good &s;upplies admini&s;ter a plenty. It mu&s;t be for health and continuance of &s;trength to eat at lea&s;t four times in twenty four hours, <HI>viz.</HI> Chocalata at &s;ix in the morn, at Ten dine more &s;paringly than the Engli&s;h, at four afternoon repeat Chocalata, between
<PB N="52" REF="35">&s;even and eight a plentiful &s;upper may be be&s;t admitted; to drink between meals may not be forbidden in a hot Country as this, for who&s;o li&s;ts may properly take a plentiful Draught of water, as it is u&s;ual for &s;ome before they take their Chocalata, but by no means &s;oon after, as &s;trictly pro|hibited by the ob&s;erving Spaniard: How|ever at other times a large Draught of the pure cry&s;talline naturally well con|cocted Water, may well refre&s;h and con|tribute to render our Bloods thin, and cir|culate the better: and le&s;t &s;uch at &s;ome|times &s;hould chill the Stomach too much, the Spani&s;h cu&s;tome of eating candied warm Fruits and Roots after &s;uch draughts may be e&s;teemed rea&s;onable, &s;uch as can|died Limes, Orenges, Ginger, Marma|lade of <HI>Guavas</HI> quiddinies, of Citrons, to be taken in little quantities as we u&s;ual|ly do Chee&s;e after meat for concoction. When the Sun declines, the warm Spirit of the Grape mo&s;t properly may be admitted, and that to a natural warmth, not an ine|briating Fire, to whet appetite and better perform the dige&s;tion of the greater meal, as well as to fortify again&s;t the nigh moi&s;ture of the Air, and powers of the neer Moon. And now it being not out of the way, but
<PB N="53" REF="35">con&s;piring to the great de&s;ign of health and life, we may well remark the Wines proper and improper for our careful <HI>Ja|maica</HI> Drinker, and herein we may con&s;i|der the great providence and bounty of the All-wi&s;e and All-good di&s;po&s;er of his creati|on. For as there is no place &s;o conveni|ently &s;eated for the quick and commodi|ous conveyance of Wines to the we&s;tern World, as the <HI>Maderas</HI> and her neigh|bours: So neither is there any wine &s;o well adju&s;ted to the wants and profitable refre&s;hings and &s;afety of the Drinkers, as &s;uch Wines are, they being as it were a <HI>me|dium</HI> between other Wines and Bran|dy, not &s;o hot as the latter, nor &s;o mild as the former, but of a good war|ming nature again&s;t the daily large ex|pence by heat and &s;weating, adapted to circulate her thick blood: For &s;uch we are liable to here, &s;utable to the brisk motions nece&s;&s;ary to this &s;welling part of the Globe. Be&s;ides, &s;uch wines afford agood plea&s;ant mixture with water, and thereby become mo&s;t u&s;eful here, where water is our mo&s;t natural and common drink. Again contra|ry to other wines, which are be&s;t pre&s;er|ved to the plea&s;ure and the profit of the Drinker in cold places and cellars, the&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="36">as it were complying with the place they were de&s;igned for, pre&s;erve them&s;elves though in a warm Repo&s;itory, and grow &s;ower and eager in a more cool. Having therefore &s;o good and agreeable conditions in our <HI>Madera</HI> Wines, we may better di&s;|pen&s;e with the ab&s;ence of French Clarrets and white Wines, as al&s;o the too heavy (as u&s;ually ordered) Canaries and Sacks, for the&s;e, more e&s;pecially the balderda&s;hed Clarrets, the covetous Brewers and Cor|rupters thereof &s;eldome &s;end them without having one part thereof burnt to &s;erve the funerals of tho&s;e they have killed. It were not without &s;hew of Ju&s;tice that &s;uch who fir&s;t expo&s;ed them to the publick nu&s;ance of life &s;hould drink mo&s;t of &s;uch them|&s;elves, whereof if they dy, they may have a &s;take driven through their Corps as Fe|lons <HI>de &s;e:</HI> But the unrighteous <HI>Mammon</HI> accruing from &s;uch Merchandize will make them better friends and entail the danger on the innocent Purcha&s;er, whom as I ought I do warn thereof, wi&s;hing him to drink his own health in the &s;afe <HI>Maderas,</HI> &s;uch being every way accommodated to cautious <HI>Jamaica</HI> Drinkers. But le&s;t while I talk of the <HI>Madera</HI> Wines with a fee|ling <HI>gu&s;to,</HI> I may &s;eem to forget my &s;elf
<PB N="55" REF="36">and loo&s;e my way, Il'e return more direct|ly to my di&s;cour&s;e, where I left my regula|ted man at his good &s;upper, to &s;upply the large expences of the Day, as well as to provide carefully for the night, which ought to be &s;pent not without circum&s;pe|ction, our greate&s;t dangers ari&s;ing thence, <HI>viz.</HI> from the great chilling moi&s;tures of the Moon, and the influence of the other man alluring Planet felt by the amorous, from whence the due moderation of Rea|&s;on ought carefully to defend the Males, who, for want of advertency herein and o|ther things, dye four or five to one of the other Sex. I mean the virile Males to the &s;utable Females, and the rea&s;on is not ve|ry ob&s;cure, for who&s;o &s;pends two hun|dred pound in one place, as oft as in ano|ther he could but one &s;ingle hundred, mu&s;t a&s;&s;oon again be bankrupt, which is much the &s;tate of the forementioned ca&s;e: wherefore let our moderation be known herein by prolonging our lives through alteration of cu&s;toms to a &s;utable adju&s;t|ment of Nature and Place. But of this e|nough; to plea&s;e therefore, let me return to my Chocalata, wherewith I begin the orderly and properly &s;upplies of the day. And here dame Nature &s;miles me thinks
<PB N="56" REF="37">as it were &s;hewing her &s;elf in love with humanity by &s;uch a provi&s;ion both for the individual and &s;pecies in one &s;ingle nou|ri&s;hment: Had the Poets known hereof, they had made this &s;ingle Food &s;erve their Deities in both Capacities of Meat and Drink, for &s;uch it, is being moderately hot as its agreeable bitterne&s;s witne&s;&s;es, and refre&s;hing moi&s;t as its cool oyl &s;ugge&s;ts, and thereby mo&s;t fitly nouri&s;heth and &s;lac|keth thir&s;t at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>If to any Thir&s;t en&s;ue the drinking there|of, or where&s;o it may di&s;agree with the Sto|mach, as &s;ometimes it may, it &s;ignifies &s;uch of no good we&s;t Indian temper, at lea&s;t at pre&s;ent; or that the place doth not naturally agree with &s;uch an one: For as|much as all Natives I ere ob&s;erved mo&s;t greedily de&s;ire it from their infancy, and if ever they refu&s;e Chocalata, it &s;ignifies they need rectifying their State. Where|fore it is not only a Food, but a natural te&s;t of Health, for when the Stomach hath too much choler, as to quarrel with Cho|calata, it indicates evacuation thereof ne|ce&s;&s;ary and expedient, or &s;ome other pro|vi&s;ion for regulating of di&s;ordered temper, but luxury is too prone to vitiate the gifts of Nature by corrupting her &s;implicity,
<PB N="57" REF="37">for a better provi&s;ion to the &s;atisfying of lu&s;ts, which as entrenching on the inte|grity and duration of life, I ought not to in&s;inuate but ca&s;heir the high aromatick mixtures and perfumes of the otherwi&s;e much better Chocalata, &s;uch burthening the Stomach, which el&s;e with fre&s;h and renewed appetite would continually grace the &s;incere Chocalata: Egs likewi&s;e gra|duate it too high for a con&s;tant u&s;age, wherefore while I recommend a daily re|petition and that doubly of this our we&s;t Indian Ambro&s;ian Nectar, I intend the &s;imple well ground and adapted Nut and water, with &s;o little Sugar as to pre&s;erve &s;omewhat of the natural bitterne&s;s of the <HI>Cacaa,</HI> which is mo&s;t grateful to the Sto|mach; who&s;o li&s;teth may con&s;ult <HI>Hernan|des,</HI> P. 8. and find there three &s;orts, and chu&s;e which plea&s;eth him be&s;t: The anci|ent Indians contented them&s;elves often with the bare Nut in their travelling, eat|ing two or three of them at a time and drinking water, to make the compo&s;ition more natural in their dige&s;ting Stomachs: With the better compo&s;ition, yet &s;till as neer nature as may be, I would have the regular living <HI>Jamaica</HI> man in&s;titute one half of his &s;u&s;tenance, it being not only
<PB N="58" REF="38">very ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, but affording &s;olid and la&s;ting nouri&s;hment again&s;t the devouring heat of the near Sun: For the oily parts &s;up|ply with genuine moi&s;ture his otherwi&s;e apt to be too much parched Body, rendring the mu&s;cular Fibres apt to motion, levening the Stomach with renovated ferment, &s;upplying the Bowels with defen&s;ive ar|mature again&s;t corroding defluxions, as well as making the &s;ame &s;lippery for the advantage of their peri&s;taltick motion: For the Kidney I find nothing more ge|nuine than Chocalata, moving a more plentiful Urine, and al&s;o admini&s;tring a bal&s;amick quality to the Ulcers, oft incident to tho&s;e parts, provided &s;pices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be o|mitted. To particulari&s;e all the u&s;eful con|veniences of this &s;ingle fruit, would require more paper than this &s;mall manual can ad|mit; to &s;hew what convenient and nou|ri&s;hing Food (in time when it &s;hall be plenty enough) it might admini&s;ter to Armies and royal Navies, would &s;well as beyond our &s;tint.

As for the generation of the Turtle, it's almo&s;t pa&s;t the creed of any to allow, without mo&s;t undeniable &s;en&s;e con|vince: for the amorous embraces of the Male and Female Turtles continue not Minutes, not Hours, not Daies; but the very circuit of a Moon, an old Aegyptian year compleat, their coitions, wherein they live on &s;eminal expences without any other re&s;taurative than water, is that, which would bankrupt the creation to imitate throughout. But then the poor prodigal, like the emblematick figures in <HI>Fullers</HI> holy War, as he went on full, he returns emp|ty, and requires eleven months recruit to vi&s;it his Uncle, while the &s;he plumps with the &s;welling of her impregnated Ovary, and being richly laden &s;eeks the proper di&s;charge of her increa&s;ing Trea&s;ury, mix|ing it, like that of natural du&s;t Gold with the warm hatching &s;and, which puts off its &s;terility by extraordinary plentiful brood of young Turtle, who by &s;trange in&s;tinct knowing their watery man&s;ion, ha&s;t thi|ther,

As for the Ca&s;e wherein the blood is too thin and ea|ger, I &s;hall need keep no Crowd of Reme|dies to confu&s;e the choo&s;er, but pre&s;cribe what nature freely offers in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and that is <HI>China</HI> Root, whereof being &s;ome|what dryed and then grated into powder &s;eparated in a Searce, let him take a &s;cru|ple, or as much as may ly on the point of a broad knife twice, for a Do&s;e, let the &s;ame be taken in bed, and repeat the &s;ame if need be every &s;ix hours: And the blood and Juices thereby &s;weetned cea&s;e from their indirect irruptions. In the other ca&s;e where the blood is thick let the Patient
<PB N="75" REF="46">bleed and drink copiou&s;ly of Pti&s;an or Bar|ly Water, till the &s;ymptoms cea&s;e by &s;uch a dilating cour&s;e, and if the blood being thinned chance to be rendred &s;harp, and effect the Dy&s;entery from a new cau&s;e, as &s;ometimes it may be: Then take of Chi|na as before.

<P>A Fever being the general door through which mo&s;t in all places take their <HI>exit</HI> of this world, and the difference of Fe|vers affording a great variety thereof, hath imployed in all ages and places diffe|rent attempts of Remedy, for &s;o univer|&s;al a grievance, or at lea&s;t of di&s;cour&s;e to|wards &s;o de&s;irable an end. That I may not be wanting to common cu&s;tome, or more e&s;pecially in any good wi&s;hes and endea|vours to obviate &s;o common an Enemy, I'll &s;ubjoin the be&s;t of my thoughts with my &s;ucce&s;&s;es and ob&s;ervations as well of the nature as cure of tho&s;e conflagrations in humane Body, called Fevers. A Fever is a word of a Roman extract derived from the &s;ame Root as cau&s;e of its deno|mination, with the moneth &s;tyled <HI>Februa|ry,</HI> wherein the Ancients u&s;ing their ex|purgatory fires for expiating the lap&s;ed, as well as for a further preparation for the
<PB N="77" REF="47">new years future benefit, both in form and intention de&s;ign the &s;ame for the publick Weal, that Nature in each individual intends for humane pre&s;ervation by the conflagrati|on in humane body termed Fevers: The <HI>ge|nus</HI> of which affects common to each &s;pe|cies or kind of Fevers, is a non-natural heat, wherein all agree, of which there|fore &s;omewhat ought to be &s;aid. By non-natural is meant &s;omething nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of nature in her delin|quent condition, though extraneous there|to and not of the nature thereof, and there|fore called non-natural. Thus the Air, Eat|ing and Drinking, Evacuations and Reten|tions, Labour and Re&s;t, the Pa&s;&s;ions of the mind and Propagation of the &s;pecies are called commonly the &s;ix non-naturals: Though congenial to and flowing from na|ture yet being extraneous from the phy|&s;ical Being of a man (for a man is none of tho&s;e) they have hitherto been allowed the term of non-naturals: Thus a Fever is a heat non-natural, though it be nothing el&s;e than an heating &s;trugling endeavour of nature her &s;elf to remove &s;ome grie|vance: Yet as this heat is more than na|ture requires for her daily management of her functions of life, &s;uch heat may be
<PB N="78" REF="48">termed non-natural: it is not contranatu|ral, though nature thereby is &s;ometimes o|verthrown and di&s;&s;olved, nor yet preter|natural, for it is not be&s;ide but with the intention of nature, nor yet natural, becau&s;e nature in her integrity needs it not, but therefore non-natural, a Fever is a non-natural heat. Heat &s;eems the active prin|ciple of the Univer&s;e, from which both par|ticular and general motions are begun, or at lea&s;t continued. The World is quick|ned by the central heat of the Sun, and the whole jollily dance about their warming Fire, to the &s;olemn natural prai&s;es of the great Recidenciary, life beams it &s;elf thence: For <HI>in him we live, move and have our being;</HI> the continuance of his Efflux maintains us in life, our <HI>Calidum nativum,</HI> or &s;acred Ve&s;tal Fire being fed thereby daily, and &s;ometimes is &s;urfeited thereof by an inflaming di&s;proportion, whereby our temperament not only <HI>ad Pondus,</HI> but that <HI>ad Ju&s;titiam</HI> is fractured into mor|bifick Affects. Thus nature is enraged often by our abode too long in the Sun, and excites our <HI>Ephemeris,</HI> or the Fever of a daies time: For which there's no need of a Cure, the very nature of &s;uch a Fever terminating it &s;elf, if we &s;ub&s;tract the Pa|tient
<PB N="79" REF="48">from the inflammatory cau&s;e. The fir&s;t heat of nature in humane frame pre|paratory to the continuation of all her de|pending motions, is the dige&s;tive heat for chylification in the Stomach, from the cor|ruption or exa&s;perating of which either from the &s;ower ferments, or too much of the overflowing Gall, mo&s;t Fevers are either continued or begun. Hence it hath been a common u&s;age as well as &s;ucce&s;sful to ac|co&s;t our Fevers at fir&s;t with Emericks or Vomits, either &s;ometimes to remove the &s;ole cau&s;e of the feveri&s;h Intemperature (and the effect likewi&s;e cau&s;eth this &s;ole Re|medy) or el&s;e timely to &s;ub&s;tract occa&s;ional &s;uccours of additional heat, which though begun el&s;ewhere would much be aggrava|ted by vitiating Juices brought or found in this fir&s;t elaboratory of decocting nature. Therefore &s;uch evacuation by vomiting ne|ver ought to be neglected by the careful attender, provided &s;uch be duly timed and proportionated both to the circum&s;tances within and without, which being materi|al may crowd them&s;elves into our pre&s;ent remarks. As fir&s;t where eminent &s;igns of a <HI>Plethora</HI> or great fulne&s;s of blood exhi|bit them&s;elves, then the&s;e clean&s;ings by vomitings mu&s;t give the fir&s;t place to eva|cuation
<PB N="80" REF="49">by blood letting, le&s;t the full ve&s;|&s;els being too much urged by the contra|natural motion of the Stomach in vomi|ting, &s;uffocate at once; or el&s;e may be for|ced to an eruption in the more tender and fine parts, &s;uch as the Eyes, Lungs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> laying the unhappy foundation for an <HI>Empyeron</HI> in the fir&s;t, or divers la&s;ting, weakne&s;&s;es in the latter. Wherefore eva|cuation by blood letting ought in &s;uch ca|&s;es to preceed the&s;e from Emeticks. More|over the &s;ex is to be con&s;idered, the Female not wanting &s;o much the evacuations, by bleeding e&s;pecially, nor that by vomiting &s;o generally, both which are almo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the other &s;ex, under the fir&s;t irre|gular ferment, or non-natural heat in the Stomach, nature providing better for the one than the other Sex by her great dif|charges of turgent humours: be&s;ides the great commotions cau&s;ed from wind in E|meticks or opening of a Vein, may in the Female prevent or corrupt natures own intentions, and rai&s;e the Devil of vapours not &s;o &s;oon laid again. Wherefore adver|tency is to be had, and that more cautious, concerning the more tender Sex &s;utable to their Nature, Time, Age and other cir|cum&s;tances. And now having thus added
<PB N="81" REF="49">the nece&s;&s;ary cautions not to be forgotten in our mo&s;t general evacuations, we may more &s;ecurely proceed thereto, and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e malignity, of which there's great noi&s;e and &s;olicitude in other parts of the World, hath no place here ori|ginally at lea&s;t in Fevers, but &s;ometimes added thereunto by the management of the attendant or Patient, who for want of di&s;charge proper and timely of turgent hu|mours; but exa&s;perating &s;uch by an inflam|matory u&s;age, they may become little le&s;s, if not &s;omewhat malignant. But our Air in <HI>Jamaica</HI> (of which oft refre&s;hed the Pa|tient ought partake) is our general external pre&s;ervative from pe&s;tilential and malig|nant Fevers, wherefore I in&s;i&s;t on the two general Remedies of bleeding and vomi|ting, as the mo&s;t proper for our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Practicer, and mo&s;t &s;afe if duly timed. I know it hath been commonly received that about eight years &s;ince when the victori|ous Fleet returned from the &s;ignal <HI>Panama</HI> expedition, that then they brought with them an high if not pe&s;tilential Fever, of which many dyed throughout the Coun|try: But this being a forreign di&s;temper brought from abroad, the cau&s;es of which I could not &s;o well judge, I am not as yet forced
<PB N="82" REF="50">from my opinion thereby, but conclude <HI>Ja|maica</HI> more happy than to be annoyed there|with directly and originally, I confe&s;s if our Patient be not timely and &s;ufficiently bled, and death en&s;ue, &s;pots from the thick blood &s;tagnating appear: but that not from a ma|lignant cau&s;e but fulne&s;s, for bleeding and cooling well timed, and thinning medica|ments prove &s;uccesful; for the &s;ymptoms of malignity, &s;uch as great oppre&s;&s;ions at heart, Fainting, cold Sweats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are here acted from the u&s;ual thickne&s;s of the Blood, for the blood being thick and when by a feveri&s;h ferment whipped about with a brisk motion &s;utable to the moving cau&s;es, the thickned Juices not without difficulty pa&s;s the many &s;traits of the Body, and &s;ometimes &s;tagnating by a plaging force of the actuated blood &s;ud|denly kill, whereas when blood is duly withdrawn ere the ferment ri&s;e too high, and is &s;o managed till it cea&s;e again, the &s;ymptoms of malignity either not appear or el&s;e are &s;oon removed, relief always en&s;u|ing &s;uch evacuation if rightly timed: wherefore if the Practitioner be not igno|rantly malignant there's no cau&s;e of terror in our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Fevers: But the two imita|ting evacuations being e&s;tabli&s;hed, we may de&s;cend to the particulars of our non-natu|ral
<PB N="83" REF="50">heat, and begin from the intemperature in the fir&s;t decoction of nature in the Sto|mach, which &s;eeing it quickly draws its neighbours into a&s;&s;ociation, the fermenta|tion is ea&s;ily propagated further, or el&s;e &s;oon cea&s;eth here by the &s;ole Remedy of a Vomit; but if not, this fir&s;t evacuation &s;ets us but the further in our direct way of obviating a greater Enemy: therefore &s;carce ever with &s;afety ought it to be neg|lected or retarded. It's u&s;ual that the too &s;ower ferment of the Stomach vellicates and thereby contracts that part, &s;o that the neighbouring a&s;&s;age of the Gall called the Coleduct is moved upwards likewi&s;e, and from &s;uch motion the ductile Gall follows till it a&s;cend the Stomach, from whence the former heat is aggravated and gives a &s;ickne&s;s in that part, irritations to vomit, and pains in the head. Wherefore the former method of cure continues proper: however one emetick is not &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the <HI>Cy&s;tis fellea,</HI> the ne&s;t of this flowing fer|ment; but &s;uch filling again, and overflow|ing as before, renew the feveri&s;h heat, hence mo&s;t rea&s;onably our u&s;ual Fevers are intermittent. Of the which &s;ince our di&s;cour&s;e is now in their chief &s;eat, and
<PB N="84" REF="51">&s;uch Fevers are the mo&s;t frequent Ene|mies that annoy us, I mu&s;t more particu|larly in&s;i&s;t thereon, and &s;hew that <HI>Jamai|ca</HI> is as kind in a &s;ufficient Remedy, as lia|ble to this frequent intemperature. Five or &s;ix of our Fevers are of this kind and com|monly called the every other daies Fever and Ague, which oftentimes is interrup|ted by medicaments or Methods, but if let alone, the management of nature proves no other than a &s;afe Tertian, to the which the Natives are &s;afely liable, it rarely killing any of them without the help of an irregular management. The great frequencies of the&s;e Agues may have two cau&s;es, the one the great quantity of Choler abounding here, the other a &s;top of the u&s;ual nece&s;&s;ary di&s;charge of &s;uch fermenting humour.

The cor|ruption of &s;implicity and confu&s;ed igno|rance hath rai&s;ed the&s;e Spirits &s;ince to car|ry the afflicted more &s;peedily in fiery Chariots, God knows where: for my part I never add coals to the fire, but re|move the fewel, and calm nature to a com|po&s;e and regular di&s;charge of the morbi|fick matter, without &s;training her or run|ning unnece&s;&s;ary risks. For my great Ma|&s;ter tells me, Nature is the curer of all her di&s;ea&s;es, the Phy&s;itian is but the ob&s;erving Mini&s;ter to &s;ugge&s;t her nece&s;&s;aries and re|move impediments, the which now re|mains, and that therein I manife&s;t the &s;ame &s;implicity that nature delights in, and
<PB N="88" REF="53">thereby is relieved, as who&s;o tries will find the benefit of ea&s;ie relief and &s;afety, in the attempt thereto complying with the three happy adverbs of the divine <HI>Hippo|crates, viz.</HI> that the Phy&s;ician ought to cure <HI>quickly, &s;afely,</HI> and <HI>plea&s;antly;</HI> without demurrs, to magnifie the cure and inflame the Reckonings; without happy-be-lucky ventures, where mans life lies at pawn; or torturing nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s, to add affliction to the afflicted. Wherefore &s;ince the intenti|on of our pre&s;ent Fever, and it may be of mo&s;t others, is the di&s;charge of the fir&s;t tur|gent monitor from the Stomach, and adja|cent parts by vomiting as is &s;aid before and the contemperating of the incited or enra|ged non-natural Heat; let the Patient upon the di&s;covery of the a&s;&s;aulting Ene|my watch a Pacate, and timely three hours before his Fit take either of the vomiting Wine, which is no other than <HI>Crocus Me|tallorum</HI> powdered (the quantity where|of matters little) &s;uppo&s;e half an ounce more or le&s;s in one quart of Wine, &s;et the &s;ame in a Skillet or Pot of warm water, wherein let it &s;tand two hours, then remove the &s;ame infu&s;ion and keep for u&s;e, pouring off the &s;ame cleer when occa&s;ion offers, whereof one ounce, or half as much more may

By the which clean&s;ing the Guts and Stomach, ere the acce&s;s of the feveri&s;h a&s;&s;ault, a fit &s;ea&s;on is prepared for our mo&s;t general of a vegetable (if not of all others) &s;udorifick or febrifuge Sweater, which the benign <HI>Ja|maica</HI> affords mo&s;t plentifully and ready at hand, <HI>viz.</HI> China Root, take and grate the &s;ame when fir&s;t dry, &s;earce the fine powder thereof, and thereof take about &ounce;j, or the quantity that two points of a broad knife will take up, there's no pre|judice as ere I found in the acce&s;s of &s;o be|nign a &s;imple compo&s;e in Bed to a &s;wear, which &s;oon without exa&s;perating heat or force en&s;ues, and if need be more plenti|ful to di&s;charge by &s;weating, repeat the like three hours after, adding for a better &s;up|ply of inoffen&s;ive and agreeable moi&s;ture of the Decoction, for which of the &s;ame Root may be taken about &ounce;iij, &s;liced into two quarts of water being boyled as we u&s;ually do Tea. To afford after half an

<PB N="91" REF="54">half of our Patients in <HI>Jamaica</HI> may be provided for without trouble, co&s;t or nau|&s;eou&s;ne&s;s. And moreover this happy Re|medy an&s;wers not only the Indications of a Tertian, but of a continued, nay of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate quartane Fever al&s;o. But I need not di&s;tingui&s;h of Fevers or at lea&s;t pur&s;ue &s;uch di&s;tinctions with di&s;tinct Cures, for though I have not experienced as yet in Quartans as much as in Tertians, nor ever may; yet &s;o much as I have, which hath been in &s;ome and in all I have met with &s;ince my happy u&s;age of China, as above, I have found the &s;afe di&s;charge both of Continued and Quartans by the &s;ame Simple: therefore I &s;hall conclude though empirically yet beneficially for the Pub|lick, for the which I write, and not further multiply under this Head, but refer the u&s;ers to the above&s;aid, who may be content with no further trouble. For to confe&s;s the truth where ere the Practicer heaps a multiplicity of Remedies, it declares his own &s;u&s;picion of the de&s;ired effect, and ig|norance what will an&s;wer his intention, or in&s;ufficiency in what he u&s;es or el&s;e a mer|cenary compliance with cu&s;tom.

Whence of late its price hath &s;unk with its demand, whereas in <HI>Jamaica</HI> this happy Root being repleat with its &s;alutiferous Tincture, which gives its weight and in|trin&s;ick worth, outdoes its common fame and any vegetable that ere I have met with, nay what the cracking Chymi&s;t brags of his <HI>Elixir,</HI> this while in its vigour, truly performs. But whether in the northern Climes it may an&s;wer what it performs in its native place, where the Pores are o|penly di&s;po&s;ed to &s;weats, I cannot a&s;&s;ert,

<P>I having after my manner di&s;patched the di&s;cour&s;e and cure of the Fevers in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> come to the next en&s;uing epi|demick, called the Drop&s;ie or Country Di&s;|ea&s;e, to which many Servants and neglect|ed per&s;ons e&s;pecially are obnoxious, and for want of timely a&s;&s;i&s;tances come &s;hort home, for their &s;akes therefore as well as their ma&s;ters, I &s;hall omit nothing healing|ly to obviate &s;o common an enemy, ren|dring it both ea&s;ie and cheap through the overflowing bounty of the great healer of us all, who hath given a balm for every Sore, and that not to be far &s;ought and dear bought, but neer at hand, were our
<PB N="94" REF="56">eyes opened like <HI>Hagars</HI> to &s;ee the thir&s;ted for Remedy. A Drop&s;ie is a di&s;ea&s;e hath made a great noi&s;e in the contending par|ties, an argument of its being le&s;s known, nay <HI>Helmont</HI> is &s;o bold as to tax the whole Schools with the ignorance thereof, and al|though he was happy in a Remedy to cure the &s;ame, which is the the true end of the knowledge of a Di&s;ea&s;e; yet with his good leave, he him&s;elf might perhaps run into as unlike conjectures about the cau&s;es as tho&s;e he &s;everely reproves. The Schools have a&s;&s;igned three &s;orts of Drop|&s;ies, <HI>viz.</HI> an <HI>Ana&s;arca, A&s;citis</HI> and the Tym|pany. The fir&s;t is water betwixt the skin and that generally throughout the Body and neer the &s;ame with a <HI>Leuco-Plegmatia,</HI> the &s;econd named <HI>A&s;citis</HI> being the mo&s;t proper Drop&s;ie as appearing in Belly and Legs, the third is called Tympany from the great Ten&s;ion of the skin like to a Drum, the mo&s;t rare though the mo&s;t cru|el and afflictive, all which &s;eem little le&s;s than di&s;tinction of degrees of one and the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, or at lea&s;t I will take leave to &s;uppo&s;e them &s;o, having rea&s;on there|fore in my cure thereof. <HI>Helmont</HI> will by no means allow the Schools to be ju&s;t in taking the Liver as the chief part male af|fected
<PB N="95" REF="56">in the&s;e di&s;tempers, and indeed not without great &s;hew of good rea&s;on, for I thought with my &s;elf, &s;aies he, to what end hath there been Anatomy in the World for two thou&s;and years, if there be not in this day a more &s;uccesful cure of the Drop&s;ie than in times pa&s;t, for wherefore are we the Butchers of dead Carca&s;es, if we do not learn thereby the errors of the Antient. The &s;ame Author therefore having in&s;pect|ed the many Carca&s;es of drop&s;ical per&s;ons, of whom he makes di&s;tinct mention, a&s;&s;erts the Livers of them all all no way vitiated, and therefore concludes the Liver faultle&s;s in drop&s;ical Affects, of which I am further &s;atisfied by the nature of the Cure of &s;uch di&s;tempers, of which anon: However I can neither allow the opinion of the more happy <HI>Helmont</HI> concerning his hard word <HI>Latex,</HI> and the wrothful Governour there|of, the Kidneys, whence in &s;hort he de|rives the cau&s;e of a Drop&s;ie, the which for want of my well under&s;tanding I be|take my &s;elf to a more evident de&s;cription thereof agreeable to its frequency in the hotte&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> premi&s;ing the u&s;ual times of our Drop&s;ies to be after Fluxes, Fe|vers and other di&s;turbances, whereby the di&s;charge through the habit of the body is
<PB N="96" REF="57">le&s;ned and interrupted, hence whats u&s;u|ally carried off by &s;weating and a more &s;i|lent daily breathing through the whole skin, rebounds inwards thence conden&s;e in|to an ichorous Water, thence aggravates more and more the fir&s;t cau&s;e through en|crea&s;ed weakne&s;&s;es and hindrances of the nece&s;&s;ary tran&s;piration, the which accor|ding to the <HI>Statica Medicina</HI> is demon&s;tra|ted to be very con&s;iderable, it being &s;ome pounds weight. And when that in part or in whole &s;hall be retained, &s;ome time, &s;uch as the Drop&s;ies u&s;ually take to come to their height, may well accumulate the greate&s;t quantities of Water trea&s;ured up for the de&s;truction of the Patient, that ere we may have &s;een or heard of, not but that &s;uch &s;tagnating Waters in time may work further alterations likewi&s;e on the &s;ubjected parts and <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> the which then to &s;ee effected, may afford no won|der, nor yet in&s;inuate the rea&s;on of the fir&s;t Waters from the weakne&s;s of the Liver, Reins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as u&s;ually is taught and recei|ved for a truth, but rather from a more evident cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the con&s;tipation of the porous Skin impeding tran&s;pirations and more copious &s;weatings, according whereto I in&s;titute the rea&s;on of the Cure
<PB N="97" REF="57">of Drop&s;ies, which matter of fact hath e|vinced to me from bare external unctions, although from greater &s;ecurity to the cure, I add or rather premi&s;e a Vomit of <HI>Mercurius vitae</HI> or of our phy&s;ick Nuts, but oft cure without and perhaps as well, the unction &s;ufficiently an&s;wering the intention of this Di&s;ea&s;e of the Drop&s;ie.</P>
<P>There grows almo&s;t every where in moi&s;t and boggi&s;h places, a large and re|markable plant called generally the dumb Cane, and that not improperly. For it &s;imilates in its large and high joynted Stalk that of a Sugar Cane, and &s;carce of it &s;elf without its leaf by the eye to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed there from, though it gives a deeper verdure than u&s;ually the &s;weet Cane doth, and be&s;ides the leaf of this is much other than the flag of the Sugar Cane, mo&s;t repre&s;enting a water Plantain leaf though much longer. The Epithet of dumb is re|markably added thereto, for as much as who&s;o toucheth it with his Tongue be|comes dumb and unable to &s;peak for two or three hours: But then without any prejudice the part returns to its former u&s;e and volubility. Therefore it appears to be no poy&s;on, however I admini&s;ter it not in|wardly as yet, but content my &s;elf with
<PB N="98" REF="58">the &s;ufficient outward application in the manner following.</P>

For apply a Catapla&s;m of that Plant warm to the &s;ide affected and it relieves from that grievance through a di&s;charge by the skin, of the afflicting blood; the remarks where|of appear on the Catapla&s;m when removed, wherefore when Nature can and doth di&s;|charge the neere&s;t way, what need we go fur|ther about. The rea&s;on why and how this dumb Cane affects the Tongue, may be the &s;ame for its de&s;ired way of di&s;charging by the Pores to the curing of the Drop&s;ie, for that which renders the Tongue as be|fore&s;aid upon the touch of the dumb Cane, is its power of drawing &s;uch plenty of moi|&s;ture into the porous Parts as to &s;trut the ve&s;&s;els, whereby the whole tongue is ren|dred immoveable, till gradually &s;uch crow|ded moi&s;ture be di&s;charged, which done, the Tongue returns to its former &s;tate with|out injury thereto. Likewi&s;e this &s;ame Cane effecteth the like on the &s;wollen parts, whereto the Ointment is applyed by an ea|&s;ie and kind di&s;charge of the &s;welling <HI>Ichor,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="59">and at the &s;ame time opening the Ports for the prevention of a further accumula|tion or return of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which I make from the cure to be originaly but a cutaneous di&s;ea&s;e, ari&s;ing from the con|&s;tipation of the skin, which prohibiting due tran&s;piration, thereby the &s;welling is formed and continued in the cutaneous parts and neighbourhood thereof, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are depending, as the belly <HI>Scro|tum</HI> and the Legs, which parts may, well be weakned by want of due exerci&s;e in daily tran&s;pirations.

<HEAD>CHAP. 8. <HI>Of Worms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FRom the great moi&s;ture of the Air, be|fore &s;ugge&s;ted, conjoyned with its quickning animating heat, it's no wonder to ob&s;erve a frequent generation of Worms, either in the Stomach and Guts mo&s;t u&s;u|ally or in other parts, oftentimes to the great interruption of Health by various annoying &s;ymptoms, chiefly and with mo&s;t hazard acco&s;ting the Infant, as the moi|&s;te&s;t &s;tate, as al&s;o the more grown a|mong the Female Sex, or the debilitated among the Males far oftner than is &s;u&s;pect|ed; from whence irregular Fevers and
<PB N="102" REF="60">Loo&s;ne&s;s, Convul&s;ions, dejections of Ap|petite, Nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s, Vomitings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> u|&s;ually en&s;ue. Wherefore I &s;cruple not, though among my few heads of di&s;affecti|ons, to a&s;&s;ign a particular Chapter thereto. Active Nature being never at re&s;t is at all moments and in all things hatching of life, though variou&s;ly more or le&s;s perfect ac|cording to the various occurrences of Mat|ter, Motion, and &s;eminal Di&s;po&s;itions. Every creature living whether Animal or Vegetable, have their le&s;&s;er and different troops of Worms, Mites, Flies, and other products ari&s;ing from the heat and corrup|ting &s;eminal Particles. Neither is Man freed from &s;uch offen&s;ive nu&s;ances, but often lowred to the very du&s;t from &s;uch little inte&s;tine Enemies: e&s;pecially the weaker &s;tate of man, Infancy or child|hood, who&s;e ferment or dege&s;tive heat be|ing not &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of their great moi&s;ture, &s;uffer &s;uch like generations to the hazard of the harbouring &s;tructure. This evil of Worms is univer&s;al through|out all places and climes more or le&s;s, but more e&s;pecially to be remarked and &s;a|vingly obviated in all hot and moi&s;t places, &s;uch as <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where from their Diet and Water as well as the place Worms
<PB N="103" REF="60">are found mo&s;t frequent and injurious. As for the Diet, Bread being not &s;o frequent e&s;pecially in remoter places of the I&s;land, for there mo&s;t &s;upply them&s;elves with &s;weet Potatoes, and a fruity kind of bread, which gives &s;ufficient matter to this intru|ding Vermine, and our water being com|monly haunted with Muskeetoes, a &s;mall &s;ort of fly which prodigally &s;prinkle their Egs every where, though &s;carcely percep|tible, yet in a weak Stomach may well be hatched into offen&s;ive &s;mall Stomach Worms, and act the tragical &s;ymptoms thereto. Wherefore it &s;eems rea&s;onable if not nece&s;&s;ary, to provide for and fortifie a|gain&s;t tho&s;e inbred di&s;turbers of our more perfect health: And when by u&s;ual &s;ymp|toms &s;uch may be &s;u&s;pected, we ought mo&s;t &s;peedily to labour there ca&s;ting forth by proper Remedies, and &s;uch almo&s;t all bit|ter things are found to be as well as tho&s;e which partake of the irradiations of Mer|cury or Quick&s;ilver. From which two Topicks we cannot want a choice of ef|fectual Remedies, and fora&s;much as Chil|dren the chief &s;ubjects of Worms and wor|my Slime, are not ea&s;ily induced to admit bitter ta&s;ted Remedies inward, it con|cerns to contrive otherwi&s;e to an&s;wer our
<PB N="104" REF="61">intention. Be&s;ides the Place or Re&s;idence of the offenders is to be con&s;idered, <HI>viz.</HI> whether &s;uch be the Stomach or Bowels, if the Bowels, whether the mo&s;t external as the <HI>Rectum,</HI> or more internal as the <HI>Co|lon,</HI> or <HI>Ilia,</HI> or <HI>Jejunum.</HI> And accor|ding to the different &s;eat of &s;uch inter|nal &s;candals or offen&s;ives of life, we diffe|rently level our Remedies and manner of cure. If the Stomach be the re&s;idence thereof, Sickne&s;s and gripings in that part, e&s;pecially at times mo&s;t remote from ea|ting, &s;udden qualms and incitations to vo|miting, pains in the head, di&s;turbed re&s;t, &s;tinking breath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may di&s;cover the &s;ame, and then a Vomit, about an hour af|ter having well eaten may be the mo&s;t pro|per thereto. But if the &s;eat of the Ver|mine be lower in the jejune or hungry gut, a fit place to nouri&s;h the&s;e milk &s;uckers to the deprivation of the whole Body from its due &s;upplies, of which likewi&s;e the craving vermin being quickly cheated by the numerous &s;ucking Chyle ve&s;&s;els found there, are rendred more re&s;tle&s;s, and there|by become more ea&s;ily felt by the ob&s;er|ving Patient. However vomitings do not there u&s;ually en&s;ue, but rather acute gripes on the &s;udden afflicting and thence skreeks:
<PB N="105" REF="61">for the greater worms being bred here for their room &s;ake, as well as the mo&s;t &s;upply of milky juice, while they follow their quickly withdrawn milk unto the ori|fices of the &s;ucking ve&s;&s;els, may well knip the tender Fibres thereof, and cau&s;e &s;ud|den twitches oft complained of, to di&s;lodge the&s;e notorious offenders, though &s;ome|times by forcible vomiting (whereby the mouth of the Ventricle through weakne&s;s or otherwi&s;e may be relaxed) they acci|dentally may be pumped upwards. As in &s;uch ca&s;es which happen now and then where large worms are ca&s;t forth by vomi|tings, yet &s;uch are not natives of the Sto|mach, but as is &s;aid before of the <HI>Jejunum</HI> or other next productive guts, wherefore the mo&s;t proper conveyace for them is downwards by the force of aloetick or Mercurial Medicaments: And fora&s;much as the pa&s;&s;age is tedious for &s;uch &s;low mar|chers as worms are, there are requi&s;ite re|petitions of the protruding medicaments at lea&s;t for three daies together, &s;ometimes &s;ix they ought be &s;timulated to their <HI>exit</HI> by &s;uch appropriated Goads. And further to render the whole Region of the Bowels, an unea&s;ie re&s;idence to &s;uch unwelcome gue&s;ts an external plai&s;ter of our Aloes or
<PB N="106" REF="62">Sempervive in&s;pirated to a due &s;oftne&s;s, which then &s;ticks well to the Navel, is ne|ver to be omitted; and further to &s;pecificate the &s;ame, powder of formerly ejected worms may be &s;prinkled therewith as mo&s;t effectual to our purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially for Children, who often will admit no inter|nal. But for &s;uch who may or will be per|&s;waded to take in a bitter &s;up of the juice of the Sempervive &s;imple, or &s;weetned in|to a dulcamare Syrup, with the afore&s;aid plai&s;ter applied to the Navel; they may need no further, provided &s;uch be month|ly repeated, nay tho&s;e who through daily u&s;age of Sempervive juice in a draught of water, have rendred the &s;ame agreeable to their palates, as &s;ome have done this as well as Wormwood Wine in <HI>England:</HI> &s;uch Children or more elderly per&s;ons have had the mo&s;t florid and healthy complexi|ons of any in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as being thereby well &s;ecured again&s;t worms and ill effects thence ari&s;ing. Be&s;ides not only tho&s;e worms of the Guts but of the Stomach like|wi&s;e, and the &s;mall le&s;&s;er worms of all &s;ta|bling in the <HI>Rectum,</HI> called <HI>A&s;carides,</HI> who clu&s;ter them&s;elves in the &s;ink of the Body or fundament, may be removed by internal|ly received Sempervive and external appli|cations
<PB N="107" REF="62">of the &s;ame bitter enemies in Baths and Injections, &s;o then &s;eeing Nature hath provided us &s;o plentifully with &s;ufficient Remedies again&s;t &s;o common an Enemy, it's our own fault if we &s;uffer for the want of the benefit thereof. However &s;ince &s;ome will &s;pare the Child for his crying, and comply with the refu&s;al of a bitter and unplea&s;ant Remedy, we mu&s;t &s;et down an in&s;ipid though effectual one calculated to deceive the ob&s;tinacy of ill commanded Children, and &s;uch Medicaments are tho&s;e which partake of Mercurial Irradiation de&s;tructive to worms where ere they are. And now I am fallen on a con&s;ideration which gives me as much wonder as any in Nature, and yet matter of fact enfor|ceth it upon us, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;trange operati|on or the way how all mercurial Bodies, &s;uch as all Metals are, operate with a kind of divinity, powerful and yet without di|minution of their Force and Virtue. Thus the common emetick Wine may always be &s;upplied from the &s;ame undimini&s;hed <HI>Cro|cus Metallorum:</HI> Thus likewi&s;e the Anti|monial Cup communicates its vomitive quality to its contained Liquor remaining the &s;ame in weight and operation, though years and ages made u&s;e of. And thus
<PB N="108" REF="63">our common Quick&s;ilver, if boiled an hour or two in fair water, renders the whole without communication of &s;cent or ta&s;t or lea&s;t imaginable lo&s;s of parts of the &s;aid Mercury, a certain de&s;troyer of worms in humane body, nay common Quick&s;il|ver is enemy to worms where ere it be placed. Hence it's received that if the &s;ame be placed any where, as among Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where worms mo&s;t frequently are ge|nerated, it defends the &s;ame there from. The why and wherefore I dare not undertake to determine, <HI>Helmont</HI> &s;olves it by an Ir|radiation, &s;uppo&s;ing Metals according to their names to be no le&s;s than earthen Lu|minaries, Gold as &s;upream and mo&s;t per|fect obtains the name of the Sun, Silver that of the Moon, Tin is remarked with the &s;ign of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> Iron with <HI>Mars</HI> his note, Copper is &s;ignalized by <HI>Venus,</HI> and Lead they give <HI>Saturn</HI>'s Character, and and our Quick&s;ilver is commonly known by the name of Mercury, which mo&s;t certainly appears to lo&s;e nothing though it be made u&s;e often thou&s;and times effect|ually to the killing of worms; which is af|ter this manner: Take one ounce or two of Quick&s;iilver (for the quantity varies no|thing) boyl the &s;ame in two quarts of wa|ter
<PB N="109" REF="63">in a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el or Bottle, pour off the water, the Quick&s;ilver in its full weight remains at bottom, u&s;e the in&s;ipid Water not di&s;cernible, as boyled, by the mo&s;t peevi&s;h palate of Children from their u&s;u|al drink of water, wherefore they drink freely thereof. The proper times for the &s;ame is going to bed or in the night, three nights afore and as many after the full Moon. But &s;ince this Water may only kill the worms and not bring &s;uch away, if the Child have not a loo&s;e belly (which commonly they have) a di&s;&s;olution of Man|na &ounce;&s;s, in their Chocalata may &s;ecure all by carrying forth the skinny &s;lough and remains, which might otherwi&s;e injure health, &s;uch loo&s;ne&s;s at the time or from the cau&s;e of worms killing many Children indicates what ought to be done. And in|deed Manna u&s;ed in&s;tead of Sugar in their Chocalata is a mo&s;t agreeable and proper purge in &s;uch ca&s;es, but le&s;t the loo&s;ne&s;s like a wheel &s;et a turning continue too long, though the moving hand be &s;u&s;pended, let our Child &s;o acco&s;ted le&s;t he be too much weakned, take of our true Sweetner of our Juices and benign quieter of nature, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>China</HI> Root powdered as much as lies on a knife point with or without as
<PB N="110" REF="64">much Sugar to carry it more ea&s;ie down the Throat, after which wa&s;hing the mouth with any Liquor, let the Child or other per&s;on be kept warm that night, and the loo&s;ne&s;s dimini&s;heth if not quite cea&s;|eth. Thus the poor and every one may ea&s;ily and &s;afely at all times be provided a|gain&s;t the general affliction ari&s;ing from Worms and the mo&s;t eminently in hot and moi&s;t Countries, as <HI>Jamaica</HI> is.</P>

<P>IT may appear rea&s;onable to who&s;o reads this and the other Chap. that this follows the former of Worms, and &s;urely venereal affects in the We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> may well challenge a particular animadver&s;ion, affording con&s;iderable intimations to all o|ther parts where tho&s;e unhappy plants have taken root. Neither may it be impro|per to enquire into the fir&s;t Soyl of this

The fir&s;t open|ing of this <HI>Pandoras</HI> Box, at lea&s;t in the Eu|ropean parts, was at the Siege of <HI>Na|ples,</HI> where the Spaniards returning from their new found World, brought with them as great a rarity, this new found di&s;temper. Thus they &s;everely paid for their treacherous lavi&s;hing the Indian Blood, and the &s;ale of their own Faith and Humanity: among others they brought this foul return of a Pox to them&s;elves. And had they &s;till engro&s;t it to them&s;elves without any participation thereof to their Neighbours, as they have laboured to do their acque&s;ts in the <HI>Indies, Europe</HI> might well have thanked them for &s;o great a be|nefit of their re&s;erved Temper, but alas! a Spaniard is too free of his Fle&s;h to be confined within his own Nation, (but like a plaguy per&s;on as they &s;ay) crowds to in|fect others with no other than the pitiful excu&s;e of the old ditty <HI>Solamen mi&s;eris, &amp;c.</HI> and mi&s;erable comforters are &s;uch all, e&s;pecially while the angui&s;h of this <HI>Ne|me&s;is</HI> whippings makes them feel to the purpo&s;e, while the inte&s;tine enemy approa|ches

<PB N="122" REF="70">The nature of the u&s;ual Cure complies with &s;uch a conceit; therefore it is found beneficial as killing worms, as all know Mercury to be eminent.

<HEAD>CHAP. 10. <HI>Of the Dry Belliach.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I refer my harde&s;t task to the la&s;t, that my thoughts may have a longer time and experience for their happy intimations concerning the Bellyach. A Di&s;ea&s;e &s;o called from its mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptome, which is exqui&s;ite pain, &s;uffered under this affect in that &s;ame mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part; a Part by God him&s;elf &s;tyled the &s;eat of fel|low feeling and divine &s;ympathy; mo&s;t ten|der, and therefore mo&s;t ready to receive all impre&s;&s;ions; mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to life, and therefore when ob&s;tructed long, carrying mo&s;t feeling horror with it: from its &s;eat it may &s;eem to have &s;ome alliance with iliack and colick Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ometimes it may add both of them to it &s;elf, which however are but con&s;equents or rather con|comitants and not the di&s;ea&s;e, no more than the &s;hadow is the Body. This Bellyach as well as tho&s;e additional torments may need the invocation as well as the name of <HI>mi&s;e|rere
<PB N="130" REF="74">mei:</HI> For, to confe&s;s the truth, if any thing hath di&s;mal a&s;pect in the <HI>Indies,</HI> it is this Di&s;ea&s;e of the dry Belliach. But that not &s;o much from the incurablene&s;s as the want of care, there being no impo&s;&s;ibility there|in, were ignorance bani&s;hed: As for my &s;elf though I may grope as in the dark in an unknown path; yet through the gui|dance of my ob&s;ervation from the nature of the Affect, the Attributes thereof, its in|&s;eparable Conjuncts, its Cau&s;es and Circum|&s;tances, Symptoms, Con&s;equents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> comparing the We&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> with the Ea&s;t, I cannot but pre&s;ume to hold the Candle in this &s;ame dark&s;ome di&s;temper. The general occa&s;ional cau&s;e is contracting cold, excepting there, where contagion from ex|crements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hath propagated its like, a cold not to be found in the Northern Climes, but even there where the Sun &s;howers his mo&s;t plentiful heat. Thus the &s;harpe&s;t Vinegar re&s;ults from the &s;weete&s;t Wine, thus freezing by the fire &s;ide mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t violent; thus harde&s;t Steel is made by the &s;oftning fire, and cold taken between the hot Tropicks if &s;eated in the region of the Belly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Cramps the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and tender Fibres of the Guts with the con|tractings
<PB N="131" REF="74">of the torturing Bellyach, and there's the original Cau&s;e, heres the for|mality of the direfull Di&s;temper. Nei|ther may it &s;eem &s;trange, that Cold and Heat &s;hould &s;o eminently meet in one place, while the whole World is upheld by its bounding contraries, &amp; con&s;equently where heat is intended cold mu&s;t obtain its pro|portion of contracting vigour (wherein its formality lies) though not of extending enlargement; &s;o that there may be more cold in le&s;s room, though le&s;s room for cold. Therefore if Cold in &s;uch places chance to obtain, its Tyranny may be mo&s;t &s;evere and cruelly urging; thus &s;trong Springs drawn clo&s;e&s;t project the &s;trong force, exerci&s;ing their aggravated Ener|gies with greate&s;t violence. For Cold is not a &s;imple privation of heat, but a &s;trong competitor therewith, and &s;trengthens its oppo&s;ite, while it &s;ubdues its force to it &s;elf: Thus the conquering heat growes &s;trong through the acque&s;t of &s;ubjected cold; the &s;trugling Enemy inflaming his Conquerour to keep it under. And if ere he chance to break the yoaking Bond, with what violence doth the Captive triumph, cruciating the tender Fibres with obdurate contractions; wherein the &s;harp &s;ting of the
<PB N="132" REF="75">Bellyach lies. But further to a&s;&s;ign a &s;uf|ficient compleat cau&s;e for &s;o great an evil as we &s;ee this Bellyach to be: we mu&s;t add the &s;uperior aggravator of all Spa&s;ms and con|vul&s;ive motions, <HI>viz.</HI> the Moon, which we have rea&s;on to allow as the timer of &s;uch like affects: for it is at her full that the tide of &s;uch nervous Di&s;ea&s;es ri&s;e highe&s;t, and in a place where her direct Beams, as between the Tropicks, are mo&s;t &s;trong, this Spa&s;m of the Bellyach may well derive an afflicting enforcement. Neither is &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition chymerical, to give more power to the direct a&s;pect of the Moon between the Tropicks than &s;he may challenge el&s;ewhere; for demon&s;tration evinceth it frequently, that Fi&s;h taken in the moi&s;t Moon-&s;hiny nights mo&s;t &s;ud|denly grow &s;hort and rotten, nay that &s;ide of the fi&s;h which chanceth to ly open to that light, while the covered part of the Fi&s;h remains more firm. Moreover I have &s;een my &s;elf mo&s;t &s;evere Spa&s;ms of the one half of a man who hath ventured to &s;leep in the Moon&s;hine, and other le&s;&s;er Spa&s;ms through long continuance under this noct|urnal Luminary. Moreover that our a&s;|&s;igned cau&s;es may not come &s;hort of the great effect, we may well add the mine|ral
<PB N="133" REF="75"><HI>Gas</HI> de&s;cending from the Caverns of the mountanous Tracts; mo&s;t eminently manife&s;ting them&s;elves in our cold Norths, as a rea&s;onable aggravator if not producer of &s;uch affects. And that &s;uch <HI>Gas</HI> mu&s;t needs break forth from mountanous hol|lows, no one will he&s;itate; and that &s;uch e|gregiou&s;ly affect the nervous parts, and cramp oft the tender Fibres in weaker men with convul&s;ive Spa&s;ms, is as ea&s;ily gran|ted. I have known in the Lead Works in <HI>Derby,</HI> there where the fumes of the &s;e|parating <HI>Oar</HI> hath infe&s;ted the Air, which as heavy laden with its weighty inmate, and falling on the neighbouring fields of Gra&s;s, hath communicated the &s;ame effect to the gra&s;ing Cattle as our torturing Bel|lyach, of which the brutal Patients give &s;ufficient notices by their bellowing com|plaints, their re&s;tle&s;s motions, and convul|&s;ive Deaths. Again, the nature of the Parts fir&s;t affected ought chiefly to be con|&s;idered, fora&s;much as thence flow the mo&s;t eminent apparent evils, &s;uch as the con&s;ti|pation of the Belly, ob&s;tructing or le&s;&s;ening of the peri&s;taltick motion; thence infla|ming heat; and thence obduratene&s;s of ex|crementitious Pa&s;&s;engers; thence their im|moveable re&s;i&s;tance; from whence the ag|gravation
<PB N="134" REF="76">of the fir&s;t Evils with addition of irritating vomitings, corruptions of Chyle in|to porraceous and adu&s;t Choler, dejections of Appetite, and a general infirmity, with an <HI>Iliad</HI> of Evils linking each other to falter the infirm Man to his unea&s;ie Couch. At the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;ure of this Evil, the Mu&s;cles of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and &s;ometimes tho&s;e of the Brea&s;t, through contractions prove hard and pain|ful, as in our ordinary Cramps; the Pul&s;e heavy and &s;low, yet eaven enough, after &s;ome time the pain is &s;hifting and commu|nicated to the Mu&s;cles of the Back; thence the Urine flows &s;paringly and appears red as if Brick were mixed therewith: Pain aggravates more and more; and want of &s;leep and re&s;t, with other unea&s;ine&s;s and commotions of mind and Body, entail a &s;ymptomatical Fever, which alters and changes as it cau&s;es do. This feveri&s;h Af|fect and irregular hudling up and down of the contained Juices, with unhappy &s;top|page in the contracting fibrous Pipes of the Mu&s;cles, &s;till inflame the cruciating pains, and like added Cyphers to the fir&s;t &s;um, mount it high enough, &s;ometimes to bank|rupt nature. But more oft &s;pin out the Thread of life to a longer durance mi&s;erable and afflictive; for heated nature by its of|ten
<PB N="135" REF="76">tryals to fling off her oppre&s;&s;ions, vio|lently forceth the crude and indige&s;ted Li|quor into the &s;mall nervous Pa&s;&s;ages, fitted for mo&s;t fine indwellers, but perforce re|ceptive now of &s;uch more gro&s;s ones, which ob&s;truct and plug them up, whence lamene&s;s in &s;uch parts nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceeds; and an Atrophy encrea&s;ing the weakne&s;s of the Members, till neither hand nor foot be able to help; nor yet the Phy&s;itian quickly, but Nature and time effecteth it if ever. However to prevent the height of tho&s;e accumulated Evils, and re&s;tore the the lo&s;t limbs and weak parts with what &s;peed po&s;&s;ible; &s;omething may be in&s;er|ted not improper nor in&s;uccesful. And now I cannot but de&s;ire the We&s;tern People, without &s;uper&s;tition to turn their faces Ea&s;tward, and &s;ee there the u&s;ages proper to &s;uch a temperament, to con&s;ider what they there do and why, with the happy &s;equel or matter of fact. That in hot Countries &s;weating is natural as well as nece&s;&s;ary needs no argument, and where nece&s;&s;a|ries are liable to be ob&s;tructed, the proper Remedies to remove are or ought to be mo&s;t ready at hand; and where &s;uch are neglected, ill con&s;equences may well en|&s;ue. Hence the We&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> though of
<PB N="136" REF="77">the &s;ame temperament with the Ea&s;t, may &s;u&s;tain &s;uperadded Evils, which the cu&s;t|oms of the Ea&s;t wi&s;ely prevent and pre&s;erve them&s;elves free from. It is matter of fact, they are little afflicted if any thing at all with this Evil there: And I cannot a&s;&s;ert a better rea&s;on thereof than their profi|table u&s;ages of Baths and Unctions, by which the cutaneous and mu&s;cular Fibres being &s;ecured from contracted Spa&s;ms, and kept open for the con&s;tant di&s;charge of tran&s;piring Particles; the original of the Bellyach is cut off, as al&s;o the crowd of en&s;u|ing Symptoms before mentioned: Where|fore let who&s;o fears and carefully would avoid &s;o great an evil, be provided with convenient bathing Tubs or places adap|ted to &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an office in a &s;weating Country. Let him alwaies after travelling and &s;uch like exerci&s;ings de&s;cend thereto, having &s;uch &s;utably warmed and refre&s;h|ingly &s;weetned with Orange Flowers, or the Waters thereof, or with our Spiknard or other &s;weet Herbs. For &s;uch Sweets allure the Spirits outward to &s;upply the extream Parts to with&s;tand their cutane|ous Contractions, which el&s;e might hin|der tran&s;piration, but now by Bathing being called forth, and encrea&s;ed at lea&s;t
<PB N="137" REF="77">in the extream Parts, the formality of the Bellyach is removed at an ea&s;ie rate. An agreeable unction of Orange Flowers or Je&s;&s;amine Butter or &s;uch like, lightly rub|bed ore the Skin; e&s;pecially of the Belly, Back, &amp; Stomach, may further render u&s;eful the Bath for the ends propo&s;ed: And tho&s;e not only of preventing the Bellyach, but curing it likewi&s;e. Let &s;uch a Patient there|fore under the binding con&s;trictions of the Bellyach, betake him&s;elf to &s;uch a like Bath, and therein &s;it or lye as long as he may well bear the &s;ame, then be removed into a Bed and be rubbed and well anointed with fragrant not &s;trong pungent Oyls. For the latter may well cau&s;e further con|tractions, whereas the more kind and &s;oft may relax the bondage; if the Excrements of the Bellyach need, as oft they do, an auxi|liary di&s;charge, let a Cly&s;ter of Mala&s;&s;es, in Milk or in the want thereof with water be injected ju&s;t as they enter the Bath, which may well forward a beneficial Stool and the quieting of the Bowels. As for a &s;pe|cifick (for the Indians have many &s;uch) my Worthy Friend Doctor <HI>Lawford</HI> of the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> humanely communi|cated a remarkable one in this ca&s;e to his Exellency My Lord <HI>Vaughan,</HI> by who&s;e
<PB N="138" REF="78">favour for the benefit of the afflicted, I &s;ubjoyn the &s;ame, having found the Plant as de&s;cribed, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an in|genious Botanick Friend here, who by the de&s;cription taken out of <HI>Pi&s;o,</HI> P. 102. happily met with the &s;ame, of which &s;aith the &s;agacious Doctor, he had a hun|dred tryals, powdered I give, &s;aith he &dram;j, in any convenient Liquor, and repeat it once in three or four hours till the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e abate; &s;ometimes I give &ounce;j, &ounce;ij, &ounce;iij, of it in Syrups: al&s;o in de|coctions and Cly&s;ters. It is an admirable An|tidote agai&s;t the biting of Serpents, and I have found it a great Diaphoretick in ma|lignant Fevers. So far the Doctor to his excellency, referring to the Plant it &s;elf un|der the name of <HI>Cajacia,</HI> called by the Spa|niard <HI>Erudos Cobres;</HI> which in Engli&s;h is a Snakeweed, for its great u&s;e and &s;ervice fre|quently known to the Spaniards. <HI>Pi&s;oes</HI> de|&s;cription is exact thus, it is a &s;mall creeping milky Plant, its Leaves not unlike tho&s;e of Mint but longer and &s;maller, of a dark green colour: its Stalk inclining to a reddi&s;hne&s;s with &s;mall Fibres or hairy Roots, between its leaf at the joints of its Stalk come forth Flowers of a green colour in &s;mall Bun|ches. This &s;pecifick being every where
<PB N="139" REF="78">to be found growing in all &s;orts of Soyl and therefore ready at hand, I'll detain my Reader no further, but recommend in my former pre&s;cribed Baths in this di&s;tem|per to be better &s;pecificated by boyling of this <HI>Cajacia</HI> therein; and for &s;trengthening the lo&s;t Limbs let the weakned parts be fortified with an Empla&s;ter of our afore de&s;cribed Gum: the which may well be renewed once in twenty four hours u&s;ing warm frictions to the parts &s;o affect|ed. And after &s;uch u&s;age the Plai&s;ters to be continued till &s;trength is re&s;tored and confirmed to the &s;uffering Criple, who then may fling away the Crutches of adventitious helps, where I rejoyce to leave my Patient.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>AS I prefaced tho&s;e Chapters of which particularly I have now treated with the occa&s;ions thereof, and my Method therein, and the Rea&s;ons inducing thereto: So now by way of conclu&s;ion to the whole, I &s;hall &s;ubjoyn &s;omewhat that may have place in each ca&s;e, where Nature &s;hall want due a&s;&s;i&s;tances or vigorous fortifying, as &s;he may &s;ometimes in any of the fore|mentioned affects. As al&s;o recommend the Ea&s;t Indian or other Countries like ours of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> their laudable if not nece&s;&s;ary u&s;ages of Baths for the keeping free and open the Pores to healthful tran|&s;pirations and more copious Sweatings. The which for want of &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances, at &s;ome time or other may cau&s;e our Belly|ach, many of our Tertians and other Fe|vers, Drop&s;ies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> rationally to be pre|vented by due and proper Bathings. The
<PB N="141" REF="79">rea&s;ons whereof are very obviou&s;ly two, the one is clean&s;ing from relicts of ob&s;tru|cting &s;weat, whereby the porous Pa&s;&s;a|ges being opened ea&s;ily admit a thorough|fair to Natures ejectments: The other is the pre&s;ervation of the Tone and Spring of the fibrous Skin, for the better &s;trength of her nece&s;&s;ary functions, both which are &s;ecured by bathing and proper anoin|tings. Wherefore let who&s;o de&s;ires the continuance of Health and vigour in this our I&s;land, provide him&s;elf proper ba|thing Places, and u&s;e the &s;ame frequently, e&s;pecially after Travellings, at which time we are lyable to Fevers, as al&s;o upon all la&s;&s;itudes and li&s;tle&s;s indi&s;po&s;ition, not pre&s;ently after, but rather before eating, and four hours after at the time of di&s;tri|bution of nouri&s;hment into the extream outward parts: Then may &s;uch mo&s;t pro|perly be exerci&s;ed with rubbings in a warm Bath, into which let the de&s;irous of health de&s;cend carefully both of time in re&s;iding there, and the manner thereof: The time, that it may not exceed to faint|ne&s;s, but refre&s;hment, cau&s;ed as well from Natures relief from her oppre&s;&s;ed Bur|thens, as by &s;weet &s;mells effected by odori|ferous Herbs or Flowers or &s;weet Waters
<PB N="142" REF="80">&s;uperadded to &s;uch Baths, after which being carefully dried and gently anoynted, let &s;uch pa&s;s into their Beds, and there re|main half an hour, not to &s;weat, but com|po&s;e nature to a fit briskne&s;s of exerci&s;ing new vigour, when they ari&s;e to their for|mer employ. Thus tyred weari&s;omne&s;s too incident to hot Countries is defeated, life it &s;elf vigorated in all its exerci&s;ings, and thereby becomes le&s;s liable to Di&s;ea&s;e. There remains as general a re&s;taurative and high, mo&s;t innocent Cordial, where|ever nature &s;hall need &s;uccours either for the Sick or well habited Man; of which &s;ince we are neer the place of its being u&s;ually found, I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omewhat both of its nature and u&s;e to our de&s;ired end. It hath been already received by all that Ambergrie&s;e is a great friend to Nature, and its u&s;e hath already placed it in high Price and great Demand. It hath every where been e&s;teemed fit to attend the Courts of Princes and great Men: but yet it is not concluded what it may be, vo|lumes have &s;welled with diver&s;ity of opi|nions about this re&s;taurative Trea&s;ure, though each agree in its ju&s;t tran&s;cendent benefit; I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf to repeat the fal&s;e opinions concerning it: for there
<PB N="143" REF="80">can be but one adju&s;ted to the truth, and all the other mu&s;t needs mi&s;s the mark. In general I can never believe it any Mineral or <HI>Bitumen,</HI> becau&s;e it is &s;o throughly innocent, and its perfection con&s;i&s;ts in light|ne&s;s. No excrement of any animal, Fi&s;h or other, as of a great Bird, as the volumi|nous German imagins it, becau&s;e of its long duration and liquid unctuou&s;ne&s;s di&s;|cernable by heat. No Liver of a Fi&s;h, as &s;ome have &s;ugge&s;ted, from its fibrou&s;ne&s;s ob&s;erved when fre&s;h; which may otherwi&s;e be &s;alved: be&s;ides it di&s;&s;olves not, nor hard|ens as all Livers do by dry heat. And it were &s;trange to find the Liver without &s;ome other parts of the Fi&s;h. But nega|tives proving nothing, I mu&s;t add matter of fact; and that, where&s;oever Amber|grie&s;e is u&s;ually found, there are poi&s;o|nous and venomous Fi&s;h, as about the <HI>Bar|mudas, Bahame</HI> I&s;lands, and the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Florida, &amp;c.</HI> Secondly, that the Inha|bitants of &s;uch places, when ever poi&s;o|ned with Fi&s;h, which often they are, they betake them&s;elves to Ambergrie&s;e as a mo&s;t powerful Antidote, and are cured therewith, and re&s;cued from the other|wi&s;e mo&s;t horrid Symptoms threatning life ha&s;tily, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of this
<PB N="145" REF="81">&s;overeign Remedy. Thirdly, that from the good &s;ucce&s;s it had agaiu&s;t Poi|&s;on, the People there venture on it in almo&s;t all their weakne&s;&s;es, in great e|vacuations by Vomitings and Stools, and all other too liberal di&s;charges of nature and &s;trength: In di&s;piritments from Fevers or any other affect they happily take Am|bergrie&s;e. And which adds to its de&s;ira|ble innocency, they &s;tand not on quantity from any other cau&s;e than the preciou&s;|ne&s;s of that Commodity. I have &s;een the Man who by good luck in finding a quantity hereof hath eaten &dram;ij at a time, without any prejudice to him&s;elf or any alteration to the &s;tate of health, &s;aving that he was cheerfully di&s;po&s;ed as per&s;ons are by drink|ing good Wine or u&s;e of <HI>Opium.</HI> But our Amber excels both, for it neither &s;tupe|fies nor intoxicates as Wine and Opiates are apt to do; but unites by its odorife|rous parts to the Spirits them&s;elves, and &s;trengthens by &s;uch addition the&s;e brisk Mini&s;ters of life and &s;en&s;e, thereby enabling to ca&s;t forth an Enemy, or receive its a&s;&s;ault without &s;inking under the &s;ame. The ad|vantage of &s;uch Auxiliaries exceds far the tran&s;ient inflammatory ones of burning Spirits: &s;uch as tho&s;e of Wine or any other
<PB N="145" REF="81">&s;uch vegetable ones le&s;s natural. Our more benign Amber carries no &s;uch ha|zard with it: it's not like the&s;e volatile Spirits who like forreign Pidgeons though for a little while may augment the home fed Stock, yet quickly deceive the hopes of the owner by carrying his proper ones in place of &s;taying them&s;elves; the like doth not &s;eldome happen to tho&s;e profu&s;e crowders of warming mixtures under the characters of Cordials, whereby the &s;pi|rits are hurried into a brisk motion the &s;ooner to ha&s;ten an <HI>exit.</HI> The fir&s;t foun|tain of all de&s;cending Phy&s;ick, the divine <HI>Hippocrates</HI> had no &s;uch Spirits for his fa|miliars; <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> men fir&s;t brought them into u&s;e, Nature knows nothing of &s;uch: they may &s;erve as external fire in cold Countries to exerci&s;e the healthy, but conduce little to the Sick, &s;aving to gratify them that u&s;e them, or from cu&s;tome ex|pect &s;uch attendants. Whereas our be|nign and powerful Ambergriefe, neither &s;erves the ignorant Pomp of thronging the &s;ick mans Chamber with u&s;ele&s;s Gla&s;&s;es, nor indangers enflaming the weak Spirits to a Con&s;umption of the much rather to be encrea&s;ed Stock: nor &s;purs hurrying nature to an overhazarding &s;trein: But
<PB N="146" REF="82">&s;uccours with adventitious and la&s;ting &s;trength conveyed apparently by &s;ubtile and la&s;ting odour, &s;uch as Nature her &s;elf hath adapted and cooked without any fur|ther trouble than di&s;&s;olution in Wine or Broth or other warmed Liquids. The which when received into the &s;en&s;ible Sto|mach rejoyceth therewith, and is perfu|med thereby to a continued &s;ending of the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions into the whole Body; whereby the Spirits, e&s;pecially the Animal ones, are not heated but refre&s;hingly che|ri&s;hed and &s;trengthened to their proper functions and ejectments of forreign morbi|&s;ick Taints not only of the egregious poi&s;o|nous ones but all other le&s;s noxious. Hence vomiting and loo&s;ne&s;&s;es cea&s;e thereby, if managed as directed in our fifth Chapter; intemperate heats in Fevers (as in our &s;ixth Chap. de&s;cribed) if urging to faintne&s;s may be obviated; weakned nature under Drop&s;ies, of which in our &s;eventh Chap. becomes fortified; putrefactive fumes from Worms and wormy Slimes of which in the eight Chap. is over-ruled; debilities in vene|real affects, whereof the ninth treateth, may be &s;ignally remedied, and the horrid Spa&s;m in the dry Bellyach (of which our tenth Chap.) is be&s;t provided. Thus we dare a&s;|&s;ign
<PB N="147" REF="82">Ambergriefe to be our mo&s;t univer|&s;al and proper Cordial, from which no detriment but benefit if rightly admini|&s;tred for the mo&s;t part, which is enough for any medicament, en&s;ues the receiving thereof. Wherefore from matter of fact in its &s;overeign u&s;efulne&s;s, from the places of its being found and circum&s;tances there|about, I will conclude with my be&s;t con|jectures concerning this great re&s;taurative Medicament as well as mo&s;t de&s;ervedly rich Commodity, which I believe to be a Marine Plant growing on the Rocks or &s;hoals of &s;uch places where poi&s;oning Fi&s;h are, not unlike the &s;pecies of <HI>Caragauta</HI> or <HI>Manguey</HI> or <HI>Metle</HI> a large &s;trong and thick leaved and &s;ucculent Plant, who&s;e leaves if broke afford a thick roapy juicy <HI>bitumen</HI> not unlikely to appearance of the white or black Amber, both which I'll &s;uppo&s;e from the &s;ame vegetable. But that the black is the more recent dropped juice, and therefore mo&s;t heavy; the grey &s;uch as by duration laying on the &s;and neer the Root of its original ere it be moved thence becomes more light, as wa&s;hed with the clean&s;ing Pickle of the Salt Waters from its more crude parts; thence it's made grey and more porous and therefore lighter.
<PB N="148" REF="83">Whereas the newer Juice, &s;uch as affords the Black Amber; may well be the fir&s;t or new running of &s;uch a vegetable cau&s;ed either by the brow&s;ing Fi&s;h, who ha&s;t|ning thither for this Antidote and break|ing its inclo&s;ing Plant, may cau&s;e it to &s;end forth this precious Juice, either by &s;torms ca&s;t up on the &s;urface of the water pre&s;ent|ly, and then it mu&s;t be black; or if it re|main longer on the ground where it fir&s;t run from its original, it turns as &s;aid before grey and may be mixed with little &s;ands and fi&s;h &s;cales oftentimes found therein: or el&s;e if the Fi&s;h that hath plentifully fed thereon chance &s;uddenly to be taken, in &s;uch it may be &s;een, as al&s;o in Sea Fowl who allured by the &s;mell, when ca&s;t on the &s;hore by Storms, and devouring much of the &s;ame, being grateful to all life may puzle catchers of &s;uch Fowl, and make them &s;an|cy that Amber is the produce of that A|nimal. Whereas as much rea&s;on is there for every &s;ort of Fi&s;h, who eats thereof, and may di&s;cover the &s;ame if taken in due time: Wherefore &s;ince we ju&s;tly may not a&s;cribe it to one more than another, I ra|ther conclude it as before &s;ugge&s;ted from no Animal but &s;uch a like marine Plant placed by divine bounty and wi&s;e provi|&s;ion
<PB N="149" REF="83">for the relief of poi&s;oned Fi&s;h ori|ginally, and thence to be brought to our more happy knowledge and u&s;e, and to the &s;ingular benefit of the Creation, in which ble&s;&s;ed Concord all things naturally mo&s;t &s;weetly harmonize, &s;inging an univer&s;al <HI>Te Deum,</HI> wherein may I but bear an agree|able part I have my end.</P>
