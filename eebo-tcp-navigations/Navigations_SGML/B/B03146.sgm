<HEAD>AN ELEGY ON Captain William Harman, Late Commander of His Maje&s;ties Ship <HI>Guern&s;ey.</HI> Occa&s;ioned by a former Copy of Ver&s;es on the &s;ame Subject.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Has't Thou for this, by thy calm valour, taught</L>
<L>How Young men can fight, and how Old men ought?</L>
<L>Is this the guerdon of the Stout, and Brave?</L>
<L>Are the&s;e the Flow'rs &s;trew'd on thy Watry Grave?</L>
<L>Mu&s;t we confe&s;s, to th' honour of <HI>Argier,</HI></L>
<L>Thou 'wer't Kill'd ith' <HI>Streights,</HI> but thou wer't Murder'd here?</L>
<L>Dear Sir, could I as well acquainted be</L>
<L>With thy ble&s;s'd Gho&s;t, as once I was with Thee,</L>
<L>Thou would'&s;t (what thou did'&s;t never yet,) complain,</L>
<L>That thou wer't now by Goo&s;e-&s;hot ba&s;ely &s;lain.</L>
<L>Thou, who &s;o oft, when Bullet, Ball, and Fire</L>
<L>Did joyntly, to thy ruine, all con&s;pire,</L>
<L>Stood'&s;t on the Billowes, as on Native Ground,</L>
<L>Fix'd like the Poles, when all the World turn'd round.</L>
<L>Thy Father's Courage was &s;o tri'd and known,</L>
<L>'Twas fit to be bequeath'd to Thee alone.</L>
<L>Valour in Thee would &s;carce for Vertue go,</L>
<L>(For <HI>Harman</HI>'s Son mu&s;t like a <HI>Harman</HI> do:)</L>
<L>Had not thy Brain commanded &s;till thy Heart,</L>
<L>Improving Nature by well-mea&s;ur'd Art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This the brave <HI>Sprag</HI> fore&s;aw, when Thee he cho&s;e</L>
<L>To run the Gauntlet, through 'our then <HI>Belgic</HI> foes:</L>
<L>When the di&s;abled <HI>Cambridge</HI> breathle&s;s lay;</L>
<L>Though (like a Stag imbauch'd) &s;he &s;tood at Bay,</L>
<L>Till Thou Her, as <HI>Aeneas</HI> did his Sire,</L>
<L>Brought'&s;t nobly off, and &s;pitd'&s;t out all their Fire.</L>
<L>At Eighteen to &s;o high a pitch to &s;oar,</L>
<L>Had bin a mir'acle, were not <HI>Harman</HI> More.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>&mdash; But did not I a Poeta&s;ter blame?</L>
<L>And am I not my &s;elf become the &s;ame?</L>
<L>Pardon, dear Friend, if Sorrow make me mad:</L>
<L>Men know not what they &s;ay, when they are throughly &s;ad.</L>
<L>Take but a parting Tear&mdash;But why on Thee</L>
<L>Are Drops be&s;tow'd, when cover'd with a Sea?</L>
<L>Yet Thou wer't &s;o belov'd, that had the Shore</L>
<L>Receiv'd thy Corps, thou'had'&s;t bin intomb'd in More.</L>
<L>For though thy Courage did the Stoute&s;t awe,</L>
<L>Thy Gen'erous Mildne&s;s equally gave law.</L>
<L>Thy 'obliging temper with it's potent charms</L>
<L>Vi'ed conque&s;ts ev'en with Thy victorious arms.</L>
<L>Nor Friend, nor Foe thy 'unbounded power controuls;</L>
<L>Thou 'or'ecom'&s;t Their Forces, and in&s;lav'&s;t Our Souls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Valour, Art, and Prudence could command</L>
<L>Was &s;till perform'd by Thy &s;ucce&s;sfull hand:</L>
<L>And when re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Fate thy Foe appear'd,</L>
<L>Though ne'r &s;o pow'erfull, yet &s;he was not fear'd.</L>
<L>Nay though her Pow'er has plac'd her among the Gods,</L>
<L>She dar'ed not to attacque Thee, but with Odds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks I &s;ee the Great <HI>Leviathan</HI> fly</L>
<L>With winged hunger to devour the fry:</L>
<L>Sure of her Prey, &s;he &s;ports upon the Main,</L>
<L>And hugs the thought of what &s;he ne'r &s;hall gain.</L>
<L>A greater Rage the <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> does in&s;pire,</L>
<L>She &s;preads her Sails, and fills them with her Fire:</L>
<L>Only complains One &s;ingle Ship to meet;</L>
<L>Shee, and her Captain, us'd to 'ingage a Fleet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They &s;tand not long at di&s;tance to di&s;pute,</L>
<L>But with warm breath each other's &s;ides falute.</L>
<L>The' in&s;ulting <HI>Turk</HI> with Bulk and Numbers &s;well'd</L>
<L>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Valour not by Mon&s;ters quell'd.</L>
<L>The Infidel twice &s;eiz'd the Noble Prey:</L>
<L>Twice from her rave'nous jaws &s;he's &s;natch'd away.</L>
<L><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ne'r lo&s;e what they 'are re&s;olv'd to &s;ave:</L>
<L>Nor can the Bulky over-pow'er the Brave.</L>
<L>This <HI>Harman</HI> &s;ees and does; with his bold Hand</L>
<L>Example gives: with his wi&s;e Head, Command.</L>
<L>'Mid&s;t his own wounds he makes the re&s;t &s;ecure:</L>
<L>His Courage keeps them Stout, his Conduct Sure.</L>
<L>And though the Shot thrice pierce his valiant brea&s;t,</L>
<L>The Soul, he's lo&s;ing, he imparts to th' re&s;t.</L>
<L>A Soul &s;o active, and diffus'edly great,</L>
<L>'Twould &s;erve, alone, to animate a Fleet;</L>
<L>And '&s;pight of all <HI>Argier,</HI> command the Main;</L>
<L>'Twould quickly 'have brought their <HI>Cre&s;&s;ent</HI> to her wane.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor will we now thy Death Misfortune call:</L>
<L>He never bravely &s;tands, that fears to fall.</L>
<L>Shall we bewail that man, who 'has lo&s;t his blood</L>
<L>In his King's Favour, for his Countrey's Good?</L>
<L>No, 'tis Our Selves that we commi&s;erate,</L>
<L>Who are depriv'd by this thy early fate:</L>
<L>Thy early fate, which did de&s;igns defeat</L>
<L>As great as could be good, as good as great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Live then, ble&s;s'd Friend, thy life's remainder out</L>
<L>In the hearts of all that Loyal are, or Stout.</L>
<L>May our great <HI>Charles,</HI> revenge thy death, and all</L>
<L>Their Fleet a Victim to 'His ju&s;t fury fall.</L>
<L>May <HI>Harmans</HI> daily from the Waves ari&s;e</L>
<L>To &s;pread His Conque&s;ts through all Seas and Skies:</L>
<L>Till's Flag command, where'ere it doe's appear:</L>
<L>But may 'He ne're buy, ev'en Victory, &s;o dear.</L>
</LG>
<P><HI>Licen&s;ed according to Order.</HI></P>
