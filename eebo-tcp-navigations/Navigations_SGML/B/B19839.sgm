<P>_WE being &s;en&s;ible how much it imports the Profit and Honour of this our Realm, that the Trade of Exporting of Woollen Manufactures into <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Sevente&eacute;n Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> be encouraged and pre&s;erved under a due Regulation, which hath of long time be&eacute;n maintained and carried on by the Company of Merchant-Adventurers, by vertue of &s;everal Grants, Charters, and Confirmations to them by Vs and Our Royal Predece&s;&s;ors heretofore made and Granted, to the great Advancement and Increa&s;e of the &s;aid Trade; And being given to under&s;tand by the &s;aid Company, That their &s;aid Trade, and the Liberties and Priviledges by Vs and Our Royal Predece&s;&s;ors to them Granted, have be&eacute;n very much of late Invaded and Infringed, and principally by Aliens, and other Foreigners, to whom We have extended Our Grace and Favour of Naturalization or Endenization; Who in requital of Our Grace and Favour towards them, make it their endeavour to de&s;troy the &s;aid Company, and being under no Rule or Regulation for Exporting the Woollen Manufacture, do take upon them to Ship, Tran&s;port, Carry, and Convey the Cloth and Woollen Manufactures of this Kingdom unto the Town of <HI>Hambourg,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> whereby, and by &s;e|veral deceitful practices of the &s;aid Foreigners, in counterfeiting the Marks, Seals, and Tillets of Per&s;ons Fre&eacute; of the &s;aid Company, the &s;aid Trade will be in great danger of being impaired, if not totally lo&s;t to the Natives of this Our Realm: And for that the &s;aid Company have &s;ubmitted it to Vs and Our Privy Council, to ad|mit into the Fre&eacute;dom of the &s;aid Company, any of Our Subjects, whether Natives, Naturalized, or Endenized, upon &s;uch Terms as We by the Advice of Our Privy Council &s;hall judge rea&s;onable. We therefore of Our Princely Care for the Pre&s;ervation and Regulation of the Trade of Cloth, and all other Woollen Manufactures now made, or here|after to be made within this Our Kingdom, have thought fit, with Advice of Our Privy Council, to Declare and Publi&s;h Our Royal Will and Plea&s;ure to be, and We do hereby &s;trictly Will and Command, That no Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, Subject, or Subjects of Our Realm of <HI>England,</HI> Alien or Foreigner, Naturalized, or Endenized, &s;hall from henceforth Ship, Tran&s;port, Carry, or Convey, or cau&s;e to be Shipped, Tran&s;ported, Carried or Conveyed either from Our City or Port of <HI>London,</HI> or from any other City, Town, Port, Haven, or Cre&eacute;k of Our Kingdom of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> any Woollen Cloth, either White Cloths, Coloured Cloths, Dre&s;t and Dyed out of the Whites, Cloths called <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths, mixt or of one Colour, or any Bayes, Ker&s;ies, Perpetuanos, or any Stockins, or other Woollen Commodities what&s;oever, now made, or hereafter to be made within Our Realm afore&s;aid, unto any th&eacute; Cities, Towns, Ports, or other Places within the Countreys of <HI>Germany,</HI> or the Seventeen Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> &s;aving onely &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as are or &s;hall be Free of, admitted and continued as Member of the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip of Merchant-Adventurers of <HI>England,</HI> and none o|thers. And that no Fre&eacute;men of the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip &s;hall Ship, Tran&s;port, Carry, or Convey, or cau&s;e to be Ship|ped, Tran&s;ported, Carried or Conveyed, any Cloths, or Woollen Manufactures made within Our Realm, Dominion, and Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> afore&s;aid, without &s;pecial Licence of the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip, into any the parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> or the Sevente&eacute;n Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> &s;ave onely to the Publick Marts, Staples and Re&s;idences de|clared by the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip, within the parts afore&s;aid beyond the Seas for the time being, or to one of them. And to the end that this Trade may be the better improved in an orderly and well Governed way, Our Will and Plea&s;ure is, That the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip of Merchant-Adventurers of <HI>England</HI> &s;hall from henceforth from time to time, admit and receive into the Freedom of their &s;aid Fellow&s;hip, all and every &s;uch Our Subjects, and &s;uch as be Na|turalized, or made Denizen, as &s;hall at any time hereafter de&s;ire and demand the &s;ame: Paying Thirte&eacute;n pounds &s;ix &s;hillings eight pence as a Fine to the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip for their Entry, Income and Admittance thereunto: That is to &s;ay, &s;uch as are of <HI>London,</HI> to be me&eacute;r Merchants, and exerci&s;ed in that Profe&s;&s;ion, and no Shop-keep|ers, except giving over their Shops, and &s;uch as are of the Out-Ports, if bred in Merchandi&s;e, though Shop-ke&eacute;p|ers. Provided that every &s;uch Per&s;on, both of <HI>London,</HI> and of the Out-Ports afore&s;aid, do demand their &s;aid Freedom, and be actually admitted into the &s;ame within one Year next en&s;uing the Date hereof, and that their Sons and Servants &s;hall at their &s;everal Admi&s;&s;ions and making Fre&eacute;, be admitted for the Sum of Six pounds thirte&eacute;n &s;hillings and four pence, according to the Statute of the Twelfth of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh.

And to the end that the Charters and Government of the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip may be the better put in execution, and to the intent that all Offenders again&s;t the &s;ame may be di&s;co|vered and brought to Iu&s;tice, and &s;uch Puni&s;hment inflicted upon them for &s;uch their Offences, as by their &s;aid Charters, Orders and Con&s;titutions ought to be inflicted on &s;uch as wilfully and contemptuou&s;ly tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t Our Charters, and this Our Proclamation in pur&s;uance of the &s;ame; We do by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council, hereby Will and Command, as well the Iudges of Our High Court of Admiralty, as the Mar&s;hal and under-Officers of the &s;ame, as al&s;o Our Commi&s;&s;ioners or Farmers of Our Cu&s;toms for the time being, and the Searchers of Our Cu&s;toms in all Our Ports of <HI>England,</HI> and the &s;everal Officers of what kind &s;oever, belonging to, and attending the Service of Our Cu&s;toms outwards, as al&s;o Our Admirals, Vice-Admirals, Commanders, Captains, and Officers what&s;oever of any of Our Royal Ships, or any of Our Ca&s;tles, Block-hou&s;es and Forts re&s;pectively, and all other Our Officers and Mini&s;ters in their &s;everal Places to be Aiding and A&s;&s;i&s;ting unto the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip and Company of Merchant-Adventurers of <HI>England,</HI> and all &s;uch as they &s;hall Employ in all matters and things tending to the Supportation of the Government of the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip and Company, and Regulating of their Trade, and for the Pre&s;ervation of the Priviledges, Iurisdictions, and Franchi&s;es by Our Royal Predece&s;&s;ors to them Granted, and by Our Self to them Confirmed by Our Letters Patents.</P>
