<HEAD>GEMITUS &amp; TRIUMPHUS. <HI>A Dream.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Upon the much lamented Death of <HI>WILLIAM</HI> late Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>CANTERBURY.</HI> By <HI>Peter Gleane,</HI> Gent.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LAte as I lay with &s;urging Cares oppre&s;t,</L>
<L>The rude Invaders of my placid Re&s;t,</L>
<L>I begg'd an Interval but to retire,</L>
<L>To Fuel up my languid vital Fire:</L>
<L>But &s;tubborn Care, reluctant Care, denies</L>
<L>Re&s;t to my Soul, and Slumber to my Eyes.</L>
<L>At la&s;t, when quite fatigued, I &s;tole away;</L>
<L>Nor could this noi&s;y Tumult make me &s;tay;</L>
<L>'Tis true it kept my gro&s;&s;er Shell of Clay,</L>
<L>But the immortal Watcher of that Frame,</L>
<L>Always awake, always the &s;ame,</L>
<L>Was &s;wiftly towring on the rapid Wing</L>
<L>Of &s;oom good Daemon, &s;ome cele&s;tial Thing;</L>
<L>Such as tho&s;e airy Emi&s;&s;aries be,</L>
<L>That with young Prophets talk in Exta&s;ie.</L>
<L>This airy Charioteer wa&s;ted me even</L>
<L>Where good Mens Souls they &s;ay embarque for Heaven;</L>
<L>Where, when my labouring Thoughts I could recount,</L>
<L>I found my &s;elf on th' top of <HI>Pi&s;ga</HI>'s Mount;</L>
<L>Where, looking round about, as I did &s;tand</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Landskip of the happy and,</L>
<L>I &s;aw (methought) a Reverend Matron &s;et</L>
<L>Wearing the Symptoms of Di&s;con&s;olate,</L>
<L>Yet &s;till comply'd with her &s;ini&s;ter Fate;</L>
<L>Not once &s;he utter'd a reluctant moan,</L>
<L>Yet I ob&s;erv'd &s;he in a mode&s;t Tone</L>
<L>More than once repeated, <HI>He is gone.</HI></L>
<L>Yet with that Con&s;tancy, that humble Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>She never once betray'd her Patience.</L>
<L>The whil&s;t a wat'ry Deluge drowns my Eyes,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t my relenting Soul did &s;ympathi&s;e,</L>
<L>My Pity equal to her Grief did ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Zealous to know and ea&s;e her Mi&s;eries.</L>
<L>And whil&s;t my anxious Thoughts were thus employ'd,</L>
<L>With elevated Hands and Eyes &s;he cry'd,</L>
<L><HI>Eripe heu mi&s;eram;</HI> another Word</L>
<L>She added, which could not be under&s;tood</L>
<L>By me; who, all this while, &s;tood ignorant</L>
<L>Of the my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s of this Complaint.</L>
<L>Con&s;cious at la&s;t that I &s;hould &s;eem to be</L>
<L>Lo&s;t in the Practice of Humanity,</L>
<L>And by a &s;low &s;upine omi&s;&s;ion Sin,</L>
<L>I re&s;olutely threatned to begin</L>
<L>To ask the Cau&s;e of all the&s;e Signs of Grief,</L>
<L>The better to proportion &s;ome Relief.</L>
<L>Then trembling I approach'd, &s;o as we &s;ee</L>
<L>Strangers addre&s;s them&s;elves to Maje&s;ty,</L>
<L>And &s;tooping too one Knee, becau&s;e I knew</L>
<L>That Po&s;ture to her Reverence was due:</L>
<L>Lady, (&s;ays I) If this unbya&s;s'd Brea&s;t</L>
<L>May be with &s;o Divine a Secret ble&s;t,</L>
<L>Su&s;pend your Grief a while, and let me know</L>
<L>From what black Radix all this Sorrow grow,</L>
<L>Undraw the Tragick Curtain of your woe.</L>
<L>Let me in your Calamities pertake,</L>
<L>That which makes you &s;ad, may me happy make,</L>
<L>And to th'Unfortunate it is we know</L>
<L>Comfort, to have Confederates in woe.</L>
<L>So 'twill me happy make, if I may be</L>
<L>An In&s;trument to ea&s;e your Mi&s;ery:</L>
<L>And &s;ure if in my Sphere it lies I'le do't,</L>
<L>I'le ran&s;ack every dark Rece&s;s throughout,</L>
<L>But that I'le find the hidden Mi&s;chief out.</L>
<L>And then&mdash; But here &s;he &s;topt me, Silence brake,</L>
<L>And very Gravely, like her &s;elf &s;he &s;pake:</L>
<L>Enough, (tender young Man) enough, I &s;ee</L>
<L>A Specimen of Chri&s;tian Love in thee.</L>
<L>Wipe off tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s Tears, my Lo&s;s is by</L>
<L>An indi&s;pen&s;able Nece&s;&s;ity:</L>
<L>Therefore your Con&s;olations pray retain,</L>
<L>They're kind-indeed, yet but to me in vain;</L>
<L>Yet here I think you only have betray'd</L>
<L>How much your Love exceeds your Power to aid.</L>
<L>'Twas not (young Man) from any mortal Arm,</L>
<L>Or humane Violence, my Sorrow came,</L>
<L>And therefore 'twere Prophane for to believe</L>
<L>That humane Powers are able to relieve:</L>
<L>Death is the Cau&s;e, that Providential Rod,</L>
<L>That fatal Executioner of God,</L>
<L>He has bereav'd me of my Elde&s;t Son;</L>
<L>Alas! he's gone! (wringing her hands) he's gone!</L>
<L>My Son, my Father, Friend or what can be</L>
<L>Nearer in Love, or Con&s;anguinity?</L>
<L>For &s;ince my Lord and Husband &s;pilt his Blood,</L>
<L>He has the &s;ure&s;t and the firme&s;t &s;tood</L>
<L>To all my Cu&s;toms, and Prerogatives,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t I a Mute in helple&s;s Widdow-hood.</L>
<L>And for my &s;ake has undergone of late</L>
<L>The heavy Cen&s;ures of an angry State:</L>
<L>Yet he; good, patient, he; ea&s;ily retir'd,</L>
<L>For 'twas a Solitude that he de&s;ir'd.</L>
<L>I follow'd him, there lovingly we &s;at,</L>
<L>Nor envy'd Monarchs in our &s;afe retreat;</L>
<L>Though &s;ome I know vainly believ'd that I</L>
<L>Had left him too in this Cata&s;trophy,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e that look'd like humane Con&s;tancy:</L>
<L>No, there I left the Torrent, 'cau&s;e before</L>
<L>I ne're Allegiance to th' Cu&s;tom &s;wore:</L>
<L>No Scene of fre&s;her Troubles did ari&s;e,</L>
<L>But I con&s;orted in his Mi&s;eries.</L>
<L>When tied to th' la&s;t Confinement of his Bed,</L>
<L>With tender Palms I pre&s;s'd his dying Head.</L>
<PB REF="2" MS="y">
<L>Watching the languid Motions of his Eyes,</L>
<L>As th'Indian does the Occidental Skies.</L>
<L>Though I was &s;ure my &s;etting Sun &s;hould ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Fetching a dying Sigh, and that mu&s;t be</L>
<L>Not 'cau&s;e he left the Churli&s;h World, but me.</L>
<L>His Pious Soul thus glanced without &s;trife</L>
<L>Out of his Mouth, that Sally-port of Life:</L>
<L>After I'd &s;een him this la&s;t Tribute pay,</L>
<L>I ki&s;s'd his frigid Lips, and came away,</L>
<L>Leaving th' exhau&s;ted Magazine of Breath</L>
<L>T'adorn the Triumphs of in&s;ulting Death;</L>
<L>And to this Mount my &s;wift Courier did tend,</L>
<L>Where good Mens Genius's to Heaven a&s;cend.</L>
<L>And here I wait a&s;&s;uredly to &s;ee</L>
<L>Him on his Voyage to Eternity.</L>
<L>His thinner Sub&s;tance &s;tem the wat'ry Clouds,</L>
<L>Marching along in the Cele&s;tial Roads</L>
<L>Till to the ble&s;t <HI>Empyreum</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>But here &s;he broke abruptly off, and gaz'd</L>
<L>About, with Arms &s;tretch out, like one amaz'd;</L>
<L>I fearing &s;ome Alarm turn'd me round,</L>
<L>For now I heard a noi&s;e of Trumpets &s;ound,</L>
<L>And vocal Acclamations from on high,</L>
<L>Which &s;hook the Architecture of the Sky:</L>
<L>And &s;till de&s;cending nearer unto us,</L>
<L>Grew more articulate, and harmonious.</L>
<L>At la&s;t a Hurricane drew back a Cloud,</L>
<L>Which did before the Royal Pro&s;pect &s;hroud:</L>
<L>When from behind appear'd a num'rous throng</L>
<L>That to th' aetherial Man&s;ions did belong,</L>
<L>Who in a Con&s;ort, <HI>Io Poean</HI> &s;ung.</L>
<L>Whil&s;t the Seraphick Chori&s;ters throughout</L>
<L>Their &s;weeter Hallelujahs echo out.</L>
<L>Some rode in Chariots wrapt in Fiery Gowns,</L>
<L>None but wore Coronets, and &s;ome had Crowns;</L>
<L>Myriads of le&s;&s;er Cherubs &s;eem'd to &s;port</L>
<L>Tho&s;e little Out-guards of th' aetherial Court;</L>
<L>The Sun his bu&s;y Rays the while employs</L>
<L>To guild the craggy Meteors of the Skies;</L>
<L>And all the new accompli&s;h'd Scene to dre&s;s,</L>
<L>To entertain the now approaching Gue&s;t;</L>
<L>Whom in a Chariot then I chanc'd to &s;py</L>
<L>Ri&s;ing afar off in the low hung Sky,</L>
<L>As from the Ocean: So in a Scallop rode</L>
<L>The Azure <HI>Thetis,</HI> with her marine God.</L>
<L>Yonder your Heroe comes, (Matron) I cry'd,</L>
<L>See, &s;ee, he does in active Triumph ride,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t his Retinue flies he drives in ha&s;te,</L>
<L>Nor ever furious Jehu drove &s;o fa&s;t;</L>
<L>I &s;py'd on's Chariot, though with wonder &s;mitten,</L>
<L><HI>&V;ltra militiam triumphanti</HI> written.</L>
<L>At la&s;t the two Retinues did unite,</L>
<L>Shouting as when two Royal Armies meet.</L>
<L>I fear'd this loud Concu&s;&s;ion, I confe&s;s,</L>
<L>Had crackt the Machine of the Univer&s;e;</L>
<L>And heard a Voice &s;hriller than all the re&s;t,</L>
<L>In which three times di&s;tinctly was expre&s;t,</L>
<L><HI>Euge bone &s;erve!</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;</L>
<L>And then 'twas Echo'd loudly by the re&s;t.</L>
<L>So marching on they di&s;appear'd &s;treight,</L>
<L>And di&s;tance drew a Veil before my &s;ight.</L>
<L>Sure with &s;uch Equipage ne're Con&s;ul came</L>
<L>To make his pompous Ent'ry into <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>In &s;uch a Chariot ne're was Con&s;ul drove</L>
<L>Up to the <HI>Roman</HI> Capitol of Jove:</L>
<L>Ne're with &s;uch pointed Glories did Romance</L>
<L>Adorn the Nuptials of an earthly Prince:</L>
<L>And whil&s;t my Thoughts with &s;uch Encomiums &s;well'd,</L>
<L>Thus &s;pake the Matron. Now you have beheld</L>
<L>(Young Man) the glorious Triumphs of my Son,</L>
<L>You think (I warrant) all is pa&s;t and gon;</L>
<L>No, more illu&s;trious Glories are to come,</L>
<L>What you have &s;een 's but the Preludium:</L>
<L>He that was late &s;o &s;ervilely en&s;tall'd</L>
<L>Is now a Saint going to be enthrall'd:</L>
<L>He that an humble Captive did lie down</L>
<L>Is rais'd a conqu'ring Hero in Renown:</L>
<L>He that&mdash; But hold a &s;udden Exigence</L>
<L>Of my confus'd Affairs does call me hence.</L>
<L>Farewell, dear Saint! dear Martyr! and to you</L>
<L>(Pointing at me) I bid no long Farewel.</L>
<L>And then away &s;he flew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus I awak'd in Sweat and Agony,</L>
<L>As't fares with Men that are in ex&s;ta&s;y.</L>
<L>At la&s;t my Sen&s;e return'd, I &s;tare upright,</L>
<L>And then re&s;olv'd this raptur'd Dream to write:</L>
<L>And leaving the Confinement of my Bed,</L>
<L>I heard the Reverend Primate <HI>C.</HI> was dead.</L>
<L>With that I into new Convul&s;ions fell,</L>
<L>For fear I &s;hould mi&s;take the Parallel;</L>
<L>Though I was told before, and partly knew,</L>
<L>All that I heard, and &s;een, to him was due.</L>
<L>But this is a new Theme, too great for me,</L>
<L>Which none can Fathom, 'cau&s;e there's no degree</L>
<L>In an indefinite Immen&s;ity:</L>
<L>On which &s;o ea&s;y 'tis much to improve,</L>
<L>And &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay enough.</L>
<L>Which never can defin'd more truly be,</L>
<L>Than when we own the Impo&s;&s;ibility.</L>
<L>And therefore all the Honour we can &s;how him,</L>
<L>Is but a little part of what we owe him.</L>
<L>What can loquacious Zeal then more imply,</L>
<L>Since all Encomiums into &s;ilence dye?</L>
<L>Silence, the propere&s;t Language, I confe&s;s,</L>
<L>Wonder and Veneration to expre&s;s.</L>
