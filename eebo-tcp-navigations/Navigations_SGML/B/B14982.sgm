<HEAD>More Newes from the <HI>Palatinate, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe hi&s;tory of the <HI>Iewi&s;h</HI> captiuitie is &s;o remark|able, that it affordeth many ob&s;eruations to the <HI>Church</HI> of God, and is like the Balme of <HI>Gilead</HI> vnto fe&s;tring wounds, or curing &s;alues vnto &s;ore eies: For for the times of their <HI>humiliation</HI> they were deri|ded of all nations, their credit lay like water &s;pilt out of a bowle neuer to bee gathered vp againe; the Heathen had no word for their Temple, but downe with it, downe with it, nor for the wals of the City, but let them be puld to rubbi&s;h, the crowne of the Prie&s;thood was tumbled into the durt, and <HI>Nehemi|ah</HI> with the <HI>Princes</HI> were mocked to &s;corne, when they attempted to reedifie <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> and to recouer their reputation. And hath it not fared thus with <HI>Count Palatine,</HI> who&s;e inue&s;ture with his euer memo|rable and heroike <HI>Queene</HI> was for the time glorious, and the manner acceptable, till the &s;upportation of his greatnes fell from him, and <HI>Prague</HI> it &s;elfe &s;toode tottering in her firmne&s;&s;e, prouing like an <HI>Egyptian</HI> reede not to be tru&s;ted vnto, yea the <HI>Princes</HI> of the Vnion were exanimated, and gaue way vnto the vnre&s;i&s;table power (as it &s;eemed) of the aduer&s;arie: then was nothing heard of but the lo&s;&s;e of his crown and dignitie, the &s;urpri&s;ing of his Countrey and in|heritance, the pur&s;uit of his enemies, the clamors of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> the deri&s;ion of the <HI>Ie&s;uites,</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> the exclamation of the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> the attempts of <HI>Sax|ony,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">and <HI>Bauaria,</HI> with all the formidable preparation, that the <HI>Emperour</HI> and hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> could make again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But now comes the comfort and cure, <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> is reedified, the people re&s;tored, the Temple erected, the wall builded, the <HI>Princes</HI> &s;ent home againe, the Law read, the Sacrifice exalted, the Prie&s;thood mag|nified, and a worke is done of admiration: for the God of breath and &s;pirits blew gentle calmes vpon the violent heate of their per&s;ecutions, and &s;lacked the burnings of their outragious fires: and why may it not be thus with the <HI>Palatinate?</HI> or, if you will, the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> proceedings? he hath hitherto had <HI>Neme&s;is in tergo,</HI> and according to the prouerbe eue|ry place hath beene a <HI>Seians</HI> hor&s;e vnto him, for in hope of re&s;titution, and a peaceable ende, hee hath found no re&s;t, but one waue of turbulency following another: <HI>Spinola</HI> and his armie enters on the We&s;t: <HI>Bavaria</HI> and his forces comes vpon the Ea&s;t, and the whole Countrey is trampled vpon with the cruell feete of his enemies: but now <HI>Rota fortunae in gyro,</HI> and through Gods mercy the vaile of de&s;paire is ta|ken away, and a new face of chearefulnes appeares. For the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> are a&s;hamed of their for|mer retraction, and &s;ome <HI>Catholick Bi&s;hops</HI> begin to &s;u&s;pect a further incrochment and tyranny, and &s;o promi&s;h faire to &s;et vpright the flori&s;hing liberty of their Cities, which can not be done, except the <HI>Pa|latine</HI> be re&s;tored, the warres ended, and &s;trangers kept from v&s;urping the plenty of their Country.</P>
<P>As for the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> brother to the Emperour, Count <HI>Man&s;feild</HI> hath alreadie abated his
<PB N="3" REF="3">&s;trength, and in a maner di&s;mounted him from ri|ding away with the triumph of preuailing, yea, he hath affrighted <HI>Leopaldus</HI> him&s;elfe, and thru&s;t vp all his enemies into Townes of Garri&s;ons, &s;o that what with the malignity of the time of the yeare, and wea|ther, and the feare of his Greatne&s;&s;e, being 30000. &s;trong: here is nothing talkt of, but Treati&s;es of pacificationwith him, and martages for attonement. For the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Spires</HI> Country is wholy in his power, except one Fort, and euery place he comes to either compoundeth for his friend&s;hip, or a&s;&s;ociates her &s;elfe vnto him: yea, he is growne &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o well appointed, that there are me&s;&s;ages (I dare not name them Emba&s;&s;es) &s;ent vnto him on all &s;ides, namely, from <HI>France, Venice, Hage, Loraine,</HI> and per|aduenture <HI>England</HI> her &s;elfe, and that worthily too. For if euer <HI>Hanniball</HI> was commended for Di&s;cipline, and good order in his confu&s;ed Army, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many &s;euerall Nations, this man hath augmented his reputation for his Martiall gouernment one way, and his noble Spirit, commixed with man&s;uetude, and commi&s;eration another way: &s;o that his very enemies can lay no imputation vpon him, more then amazement, what cour&s;e this braue built Barke will take in this turbulent Ocean of defiances, when all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;tand thus watching one ano|thers proceedings. And thus much for Count <HI>Man&s;|feild,</HI> and the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> hopes to &s;ee once a|gaine the &s;cattered limbs of <HI>Pelops</HI> gathered together and the broken bones of his Fortune well &s;et againe, made &s;trong and &s;tronger, like broken bones indeed, that proue the better for their fir&s;t fraction, being well cured by a cunning Surgeon.</P>

<P>The elder Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> as it &s;hould &s;eeme, is not dead: For by rea&s;on of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hauer&s;taffs</HI> letters, the yonger Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> hath played the Souldier all this Winter, and taken in 8. or 9. Townes of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Ments</HI> and <HI>Cullen,</HI> and al|though &s;ince February Count <HI>Harry Vanderbergh</HI> is gone vp again&s;t him, &s;ince he tooke <HI>Gulick,</HI> and a <HI>Colonell</HI> of <HI>Bauaries,</HI> and another of <HI>Don Gonzales,</HI> be|ing in all 12000. foot, and 2000. Hor&s;e, are likewi&s;e marched to intercept his forwardne&s;&s;e: yet hath he proued very fortunate in his expeditions, and kept his ground in de&s;pight of the proude&s;t wra&s;tlers. But we &s;ay here, that the&s;e two la&s;t Colonells named, are retired backe againe, as taking their fir&s;t iourney vpon a rumor, that there were 8000. Engli&s;h co~ming into the Countrey, and hoping of good pa&s;&s;age by the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> meanes, whom the&s;e <HI>Baua|rians</HI> meant to intercept. But this rumor ran her &s;elfe quickly out of breath. For by the fir&s;t of March, let|ters of credit came, that not a Drumm was beaten in <HI>England</HI> to &s;uch a purpo&s;e, whereupon they returned backe againe to their Generalls, for feare of Count <HI>Man&s;feilds</HI> comming vpon them, and &s;urprizing them vnawarres.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Count <HI>Man&s;feild</HI> thus proceeded, and had his affaires carried in a &s;weet pa&s;&s;age boat of &s;ucce&s;&s;e, the Prote&s;tant Princes loath to be behind hand with him in corre&s;pondency, &s;eeing the great ayds which came in, and the many Forces promi&s;ed, engag'd them&s;elues likewi&s;e to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, namely, the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baben,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Wittenbergh,</HI> the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Aen&s;burch,</HI> and the <HI>Lan&s;sgraue</HI> of <HI>He&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4">who euery one prepared 10000. men for the Spring, and made tender of their &s;eruice accordingly, &s;o that if performances follow, &amp; this faire &s;hadow of good words haue but an equall body of &s;ub&s;tance, and a|uayleable actions, the Summer fields may be filled with an Armie of a 100000. men, which though it &s;ound too har&s;hly in the eares of Souldiers, who know, what 40000. armed men can doe, and &s;eeme ridiculous to Polliticians, who pre&s;ently demand af|ter the money to pay them: yet is it certaine, that the&s;e Princes &amp; Lords of Countries haue made their tongues pronounce the iudgement, as for the con|&s;ent of the heart, and the many contingents, which may happen di&s;a&s;trou&s;ly, the&s;e are wrapped vp in the clo&s;et hou&s;e of Heauen, and being <HI>arcana coeli,</HI> it is not for polluted hands to reach at them, no more then for vs to know, whether <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> will goe on, as he hath done, to hold the Emperor play in tho&s;e quarters, which if he doe, then let equall men iudge (for all there is a report, that there are 8000. men come out of <HI>Italy</HI> to <HI>Leopaldus</HI>) whether the Emperor can be any way &s;o &s;trong, as the Princes, I might better &s;ay, his Excellency Count <HI>Man&s;feild.</HI> For without controuer&s;ie, he is now &s;uch a &s;pirit rai&s;d that I beleeue will hardly be coniured downe againe by &s;uch forces, as the Emperor can either &s;pare, or prouide &s;o &s;oone. But the Summer is the time that Armies goe into the fields, and &s;o till that time, we will &s;u&s;pend all predictions, and anticipations.</P>
<P>The fa&s;t letters from <HI>Vienna</HI> report diuers things, both of the Emperors pretended mariage, and of the Turkes making peace with <HI>Poland;</HI> but e&s;pecially,
<PB N="6" REF="5">concerning the contracts with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> which hath &s;pent mo&s;t part of the Winter in their Treaties, and is indeed &s;u&s;pected not to haue any good &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e, becau&s;e <HI>Bethelem Gabor</HI> will not conclude it without the Emperour of <HI>Turkes</HI> con&s;ent, to whom he is Tributary; and the <HI>Turke</HI> will not con&s;ent, be|cau&s;e he pretends that the Emperor hath broken with him, and &s;et vpon his friends in his ab&s;ence, or not kept promi&s;e in &s;ending his Emba&s;&s;ador to the <HI>Sacraporta,</HI> as hath bin the cu&s;tome, and &s;o to attend him in his warres. Thus in&s;teed of reconciliation, is he rather threatned, and for any thing we heare, the Prince of <HI>Tran&s;iluania</HI> affects the re&s;titution of the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and will pro&s;ecute his recouery as farre as he can, or is able. But which way &s;oeuer it chance, <HI>Dulce Bellum inexpertis,</HI> and the warre hath not onely made &s;carres in the face of this plea&s;ant Countrey, but filled it with wrinckles, which haue taken in &s;o much &s;oile, and durt, and &s;weat, that I am affrayd the running water of peace will hardly wa&s;h it cleane againe in good time, and it will &s;carce re|couer her pri&s;tinat glory in many yeares. But of all other things mo&s;t lamentable, the Church of God hath &s;uffered deua&s;tation, and the backes and &s;ides of Religion haue beene la&s;hed with cruell &s;tripes, and the tormentors hand hath gon ouer them and ouer them againe: For <HI>Idolatry</HI> hath made the walls of tho&s;e Churches weepe, where God hath beene truely wor&s;hipped, and not the name of an Image heard in many yeares. The pulpits haue beene trampled in with tho&s;e ob&s;coene feet, who&s;e ma&s;ters haue trod vp on the graues of poore decea&s;ed <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and by the
<PB N="7" REF="5">name of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> thought them onely worthy to be receptacles for their ordure, making their Chappels a very Stewes: the hou&s;es which haue lodged their garri&s;ons, haue been filled with their &s;trumpets, who haue made the hearts of the owners &s;ad againe, with their filthy pro&s;titution, abominable Ma&s;&s;es, &s;ongs of ribaldry, inuectiues again&s;t Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel, and many other fearefull impieties of &s;uper&s;tition and bla&s;phemie: yea all places haue beene repleni|&s;hed like the groues and alrars of the heathen, with mixtures of incen&s;e and &s;acrifice, which I know, &s;tinck wor&s;e then the &s;mell of a dung-hill in the no|&s;trils of our &s;anctifier, and great God, &s;o that I make no que&s;tion, he will one day take his owne cau&s;e in hand, and deliuer vs from this v&s;urpation and intru|&s;ion, &s;o that for this point I end with the Motto,
<Q>Dies dabit, quod dies negat.</Q></P>
<P>I will not di&s;pute neither of the prerogatiue of Conquerors, nor condition of the conquered, of the riches of <HI>Emperours,</HI> nor the power of <HI>Princes,</HI> of the trea&s;ure of <HI>Kings,</HI> nor aboundant wealth of <HI>Monarchs</HI> of the nece&s;&s;itie of the Souldiers, who mu&s;t either liue vpon their prey, &s;alary, or &s;poyle, or the incon|ueniences of a gari&s;on in a Country ouer-watched with many di&s;a&s;trous accidents. But this I am &s;ure of, that tho&s;e &s;ouldiers which <HI>Spinola</HI> left behind him, are not onely wa&s;ted with many malignant circum&s;tances, but wearied and tormented for want of pay and entertainment: In&s;omuch that <HI>Don Gon|&s;ales de Cordira</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h Generall</HI> laid a new impo|&s;ition vpon that part of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> vnder his iuri&s;|diction of a 100000 dollers, which amounteth to
<PB N="8" REF="6">20000. lib. &s;terling, whereabout the people were mi|&s;erably handled: For although they pleaded the de|ua&s;tation of their Countrey, and the many wre&s;tings from them the ble&s;&s;ings which God had imparted af+ter great toile, labour, and endurances: yet nothing &s;erued the turne but pre&s;ent money, and the Cap|taines had much adoe to pacifie the Souldiers before the taxe was gathered, and the impo&s;ition rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this time, it is the mid&s;t of February, and there|fore it is time to tell you, what a hard Winter wee haue had, and what &s;trange &s;ights wee haue &s;eene. The <HI>Palatinate</HI> hath beene &s;ubiect to &s;uch fro&s;t and &s;now, that the <HI>Rhene</HI> hath beene frozen 7. or 8. weeks together, and &s;ince it began to thaw, which was the 5. of February, we haue had drie and clo&s;e weather, yet faire and &s;ro&s;ty mornings: then grew it clo&s;e and mi&s;ty againe 2. or 3. dayes, afterwards it waxed warm but not long: then the mornings brought vs &s;mall raine till ten of the clocke, but the 14. and 15. were very wet, by rea&s;on of which vncertainty of weather many <HI>proiects</HI> were di&s;appointed, and diver&s;e excur|&s;ions being made, the Souldiers returned without effecting their purpo&s;es: yet did <HI>Generall Vere</HI> ouer&s;lip no opportunitie, which either &s;erued to annoy the enemy, or relieue his friends, hee vi&s;ited the &s;con|ces and gari&s;ons, &amp; &s;upplied their wants as he could, he made new <HI>ramparts</HI> at <HI>Hidelburg,</HI> leauing therein Sir <HI>Garret Herbert</HI> as I take it with 2. Companies of Engli&s;h: but the maine gouerment was vnder a <HI>dutch Colonell,</HI> he fortified <HI>Franckendale,</HI> and the &s;conces on the pa&s;&s;ages, hee watched <HI>Mainhem</HI> and lay therein him&s;elfe: he reveiwed all other places, which &s;tood
<PB N="9" REF="6">in neede of his care, and dilligence, and &s;o much for weather, now to our &s;ights and apparitions.</P>
<P>The 5. of this pre&s;ent February, about one of the clock, there appeared very plainly 3. full coloured Raine-bowes, one bending from <HI>&s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t</HI> to|ward the <HI>north:</HI> the other oppo&s;ite to it from <HI>&s;outh|we&s;t northward,</HI> the third was called <HI>Iris Verticalis,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Center</HI> was the <HI>Sunne</HI> it &s;elfe: there were al&s;o 3. more dimmer and not &s;o well coloured, compa&s;|&s;ing the <HI>Sunne</HI> as it were, but yet of di&s;tance &s;ome de|grees: The night following were many fla&s;hings of the aire of lightning, and as it hapneth in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;ome there were, that &s;aw armed men fighting, and &s;ome that heard the clas&s;hings of armour, and &s;ome, that &s;ayd plainely the&s;e things were not cu&s;tomary, but portended tumultuary convul&s;ions on all &s;ides: I confe&s;&s;e I remembred the Starre 1618. and made a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of many accidents, which haue hapned &s;ince, and although wee were not much amazed at the&s;e things, becau&s;e there was no preuenting of that which God had appointed: yet it made vs make this v&s;e, to pray to God to diuert his iudgment from vs, and continue his mercy towards vs, as for coniectu|ring the wor&s;t, which was warre, blood, and trouble, who could not apprehend as much, without whi&s;pe|ring of prophe&s;ies, or calculating natiuities, or af|frighting any fearefull man, when all <HI>Europe</HI> was in Armes, and the <HI>Princes</HI> of the earth &s;tood ga&s;ing at one anothers Fortunes.</P>
<P>By this time Count <HI>Man&s;feild</HI> had &s;ent to <HI>Loraine,</HI> and had likewi&s;e an&s;wer from the Duke, which &s;ome will haue to this purpo&s;e, That for his owne part he
<PB N="10" REF="7">was willing to giue way for his pa&s;&s;age, whether he meant to goe to <HI>Artoies,</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> But the King of <HI>France</HI> would by no means con&s;ent thereunto, which whether it were plea&s;ing to his Excellency or no, I will not di&s;pute: this I am &s;ure, that it made his own Souldiers talke at randome, that he meant to diuert the warre from the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and either draw it into <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Flanders.</HI> As for the hope of rendition, he would not medle with other Princes de&s;ignes, but in a maner he warranted the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> a better recompence then the rendition of his Countrey, or peraduenture the Crowne of <HI>Bohemia</HI> it &s;elfe, where|upon reciprocall letters haue pa&s;&s;ed betweene them, and no doubt there &s;hall no enterpri&s;e be &s;et on foot, but by direction of a Councell of warre from the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> and &s;o running to one another with &s;weet conueiance, Count <HI>Man&s;feild</HI> &s;hall be (as it were) the Ce&s;terne to entertaine the water comming from the&s;e Springs: For although the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> lieth now quiet at the <HI>Hage,</HI> yet no que&s;tion is his &s;pirit working in o|ther places, and time will perfect that, which we now imagine is an vnperfect <HI>Chaos</HI> of confu&s;ion, and &s;o much for the bu&s;ines as it hangeth in &s;u&s;pence, and cannot yet make euen the skoales of mi&s;chiefe and mi&s;fortune, as we prophanely abu&s;e that tearme, and <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>I vnder&s;tand by many me&s;&s;engers, that your <HI>Co|rantos</HI> in <HI>England</HI> are &s;o tran&s;lated, and ob&s;equious to the Dutch Coppies, that they neuer mention any exployt of the Engli&s;h, nor vouch&s;afe to attribute the glory of any enterpri&s;e vnto them, as forgetting
<PB N="11" REF="7">Captaine <HI>Boroghs,</HI> at the &s;iege of <HI>Franckendale,</HI> and diuers valiant Gentilmen in other places, nay, they &s;carce mention <HI>Generall Vere</HI> him&s;elfe, who is worthy of all memory, for his con&s;tant re&s;olution, and noble courage in the&s;e wants &amp; endurances: For although &s;ome Polliticians haue giuen it out, that <HI>Spinola</HI> might as well haue run all ouer the Countrey, as doe that he did, yea, taken <HI>Heidelberg</HI> it &s;elfe, if he had kept his Armie together, and therefore that which was left vndon, mu&s;t be imputed to his commi&s;era|tion, or peraduenture, directio~s from higher powers: yet will not I giue way to &s;uch opinion, but an&s;were plainly and hone&s;tly, that by that time the Engli&s;h had fortified the places, and hunted the enemy with &s;et Batalions, it was not &s;o ea&s;ie to climbe trenches and ramparts, and come ouer the heads of Pikes, or &s;top the mouthes of Cannons: Witne&s;&s;e the inter|ception of <HI>Bauaria</HI> him&s;elfe, who ambitiou&s;ly &s;wal|lowing the whole <HI>Palatinate,</HI> as a gift of the Emperor, came forward a pace with proud &s;teps to &s;traddle o|uer it like a <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> and thought at once to inue&s;t him&s;elfe with her robe and Coronet: but GOD be thanked, it is yet vndone, and if euer a Prouerbe was verified, we may well &s;ay by him;

<P>But to my fir&s;t purpo&s;e, &s;eeing the Dutch will tell you no Stories of the Engli&s;h, I will tell you one of the Dutch.</P>
<P>Vpon the la&s;t of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> when the Fro&s;t began to breake, a certaine Dutch Captaine, full of pre&s;ump|tuous words, and o&s;tentous braggs, re&s;olued to per|forme
<PB N="12" REF="8">&s;ome exployt vpon <HI>Steine</HI> a Ca&s;tle, which &s;tood in the mid&s;t of woods and waters, and for which <HI>Don Gonzalis</HI> fir&s;t brake the Truce, the 20. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t: whereupon as well acquainted with the pa&s;&s;ages, and all the &s;ecrets of the place, he vndertooke this enter|pri&s;e with a 100. men, and came accordingly thither by foure a clocke in the morning, nor did he this temerariou&s;ly to the outward &s;how, but had good &s;earches and &s;cout-ma&s;ters before to vnder&s;tand the &s;trength of the place (be&s;ides his owne knowledge of the &s;cituation) the number of the Guard, and the order of the Sentinells, with all other things apper|taining to a &s;urpri&s;e. But &s;ee the mi&s;fortune! as &s;oone as euer the Sentinell had di&s;charged his Mu&s;ket, he quickly fell from his re&s;olution, as a man di&s;tracted, and very ba&s;ely cryed out, We are di&s;couered, <HI>A retreat, a retreat;</HI> and when the Souldiers an&s;wered a|gaine, there was yet no danger, nor could be any in the pro&s;ecution, he rode in among&s;t them, and beat them backe mo&s;t cowardly, as if 10000. enemies had come toward them: yet for all this, when he and his company had thus runne away, at the &s;ame time a Dutch Lieutenant, with le&s;&s;e then fiftie men, &s;urpri|&s;ed, and cut off the whole Court of Guard in the Scon&s;e before the Ca&s;tle, tooke many pri&s;oners, and made the re&s;t &s;ecure them&s;elues with in the wals, from whence they played apace, but did not hurt aboue one man: but by rea&s;on they wanted their <HI>Patars,</HI> and that the Captaine and his company were gone &s;o far off, they could not enter the gates, nor &s;ap the wals, but made a braue Retreat indeed, and came &s;afely to their <HI>Rendezuous.</HI> But the Captaine in &s;tead of ren|dring
<PB N="13" REF="8">an account to my Lord <HI>Generall</HI> of his actions, ran away for &s;hame, and was no more &s;eene in pub|lique among the Souldiers; yet had the Lieutenant thankes, and a gratuitie, according to the worthines of his de&s;eruing.</P>
<P>This I thought good to &s;et downe as a ta&s;t of &s;uch bitter pils, we are many times co~&s;trained to &s;wallow, as either the <HI>Dutch</HI> proue vnruly, or out of &s;u&s;pition of ouer-ma&s;tring, ca&s;t vp an vntoward account of their owne weaknes: Thus lo&s;t we this opportunitie of the la&s;ting fro&s;t, con&s;idering the place was of im|portance, and now mu&s;t be contented: For in open weather the Ca&s;tle is in a manner impregnable, as &s;tanding (as I &s;ayd) in &s;uch a fa&s;tne&s;&s;e of wood, and water.</P>
<P>Whiles the affaires of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> cheered our hearts with the expectatio~ of good deliuerance from all our troubles, newes came for certaine, that the <HI>Em|peror</HI> was married, and the <HI>Pope</HI> had &s;ent the <HI>Empre&s;&s;e</HI> an hallowed ro&s;e of gold, with other reliques, which &s;hee receiued very graciou&s;ly at the hands of <HI>Seigneur Pero&s;pi</HI> his <HI>Nuntio.</HI></P>
<P>Although the fro&s;t and &s;now was very great, yet it is &s;ayd, that the <HI>Neopolitans,</HI> and other <HI>Italian</HI> &s;ouldi|ers taking advantage of certaine contracts, and arti|cles betweene the <HI>Grizons,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> garri&s;ons, haue aduentured through the pa&s;&s;ages, and with the lo&s;&s;e of 800. men by the a&s;perity of wether, pre&s;ented a body of 800. to <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> who thereupon attemp|ted both to recouer <HI>El&s;as Saueren,</HI> and his Countrey, which were &s;poyled a new for breach of their faith to <HI>Count Man&s;feild,</HI> and to &s;end a defiance to his <HI>Excel|lencie,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="9">who for all the report of the <HI>Catholicke</HI> great|ne&s;&s;e, &s;miled at the <HI>bravado,</HI> as re&s;oluing vpon other maner of bu&s;ines, then fighting of a battle in a coun|try where nothing was to be gotten.</P>
<P>About the 15. of February, a great fire hapned at <HI>Landenburgh,</HI> as you goe to <HI>Heidelburgh,</HI> which not onely burnt down the two great gates, but con&s;umed many roomes and chambers, yea diuers &s;ouldiers, that had the watch of the Tower, and guard of the place: yet was the mi&s;cheife imputed to the watch, and the Country much affrighted came in to com|plaine to the Gouernour of the offenders.</P>
<P>Report is &s;till bu&s;ie among&s;t vs, and to comfort vs in our wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;e in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> a&s;&s;ureth that all the Countries round about, namely <HI>Spires, El&s;os, Stra&s;burgh,</HI> and all the bi&s;hopricks in generall, are ready to &s;tarue, and haue not &s;ufficient viands for their owne inhabitants, whereupon <HI>Count Man&s;field</HI> hath written to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Wittenbergh,</HI> for pa&s;&s;age through his country, &s;o that it is &s;uppo&s;ed, he either intendeth for <HI>Bavaria</HI> or <HI>Vienna,</HI> vnles he play the lap wing, who commonly flieth furthe&s;t from her ne&s;t, &amp; &s;o may he giue notice of one thing, and yet pretend another.</P>
<P>Much about this time his Excellency <HI>Count Man&s;|field</HI> vnder&s;tanding that the <HI>Bavarian Regiment</HI> was vnder the command of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> and lay quartred vpon the <HI>neckar</HI> in the <HI>ampt mo&s;begg,</HI> &s;ent to the town of <HI>Hagenaw</HI> for a new compo&s;ition, &amp; &s;o had 30000. Florens by way of a taxe or new leauie: thus doth he both increa&s;e and inrich him&s;elfe, yet is not his de|termination knowne, what he will do with his great
<PB N="15" REF="9">armie, more then that (as they &s;ay) he writ letters of comfort to <HI>Heidelburg,</HI> and <HI>Generall Vere</HI> at <HI>Mainhem,</HI> who&s;e hor&s;e went out the &s;ame day vpon an expedi|tion, and tooke many wagons loaden with proui&s;i|on, and diuers pri&s;oners, who were ran&s;omed after the maners of &s;oldiers: they went out to releiue <HI>Lan|denburgg</HI> and other townes in the enemies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io~, for they were &s;ubiect to hunger and cold, and there peri&s;hed of the inhabitants very neere 600.</P>
<P>After <HI>Graue Hendrick Van</HI> being with the garri&s;ons of <HI>Gulick,</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhene,</HI> as was &s;uppo&s;ed, to ioyne with the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were comming into <HI>Ha&s;&s;ia:</HI> the Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;|wick,</HI> &s;tored <HI>Pater borne</HI> and many townes with &s;oul|diers, and re&s;olued to encounter them, which way &s;o euer they came or went, but as they had done once before, &s;ome occa&s;ion deuided them all, for they ne|uer met; but for any thing I heare, they were glad of good &s;helter in this cold and vn&s;ea&s;onable weather.</P>
<P>There are other things, of which I could write, but I am &s;ure you dare not publi&s;h: For &s;uch is the nature of rumor, that a little truth begetteth many ab&s;urdities, like a Ball of &s;now, which by often row|ling groweth bigger and bigger; and therefore I de|&s;i&s;t at this time, till better occa&s;ion pre&s;ent better mat|ter vnto me, which, I am &s;ure, is now in the wombe, and longeth for a birth and faire deliuerance. The &s;umme of all is, that God (as he hath done) will maintaine the cau&s;e of his Church; and Religion (as &s;he hath done) will &s;hew her owne &s;plendor, in de&s;pight of clouds and oppo&s;ition, like the Sunne, that may be a while ob&s;cured, but at la&s;t openeth the
<PB N="16" REF="10">vapours, and commeth like a Bride out of her cham|ber. As for man, though there is no quarrell &s;o iu&s;ti|fiable as the defence of the Go&s;pel, and propagation of the &s;ame, if yet there be mixtures of priuate re|uenge, enuie, ambition, de&s;ire of renowne, couetou&s;|ne&s;&s;e, and that which we call heroike vallour in the ampliation of territories; it will taint the good cau&s;e, like dead flies in boxes of ointments, and God will haue no &s;uch mixtures, as collaterall corruption to be &s;hadowed vnder the defence of his Truth: there|fore I make no que&s;tion of a recouery in the <HI>Palati|nate,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;ee apparantly &s;o many good &s;oules and di&s;po&s;itions both grieued at the ce&s;&s;ation of the publique Mini&s;try in many places, and vexed againe at the impietie of Papi&s;ticall <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> who dare bring the pattern of the Altar of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> into the temple of God. And as for their obiection, that maintaine, that the Souldiers of Count <HI>Man&s;feilds</HI> Armies, and the re&s;t of the Princes, which pretend the defence of the King of BOHEMIA's cau&s;e, are either mo&s;t of them Papi&s;ts, or of no Religion: and yet forrage, and &s;poyle the Countries of Catholick Bi&s;hops, and &s;uch Lords, as know no other but the obedience of the Popes Supremacy. I an&s;wer plainly and hone&s;t|ly: What of that? God will bring his purpo&s;e this way about: Though <HI>Nabuchadnezzar</HI> be an hypo|crite, yet for the time &s;hall his Idoll be trampled to du&s;t, and be no more wor&s;hipped: Though <HI>Cyrus</HI> be a Heathen, yet God calleth him his &s;eruant, and he &s;hall &s;end the people to re-edifie <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> and the ve&s;&s;els of Gold backe againe to adorne the Temple: And though Papi&s;ts maintaine their ab&s;urd opini|ons,
<PB N="17" REF="10">yet &s;hall they be made in&s;truments of Gods glo|ry, and euen de&s;troy one another, till either they be conuerted, or effectuate that worke, which he &s;et|teth them about: In which expectation we remaine at this houre, and exhilerate our &s;elues, that the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in hand is in &s;o good a forwardne&s;&s;e.</P>
