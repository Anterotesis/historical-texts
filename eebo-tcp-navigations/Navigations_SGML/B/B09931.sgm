<HEAD>The Sad and Dreadfull Accident OF THE BURNING OF A Rich Turkey Ship BY LIGHTNING, IN THE ROAD of GRAVESEND: On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 23d. of <HI>June,</HI> 1687.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Sea&s;on for &s;ome months pa&s;t has been extraordi|nary, beyond the Memory of Man, for the Vio|lence of the Winds, &s;o the Element of Fire has pro|duced &s;o prodigious effect on the Watry Region, as to &s;hew Mankind which of the Elements has predominancy o|ver the other, making the demon&s;tration on a floating World in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> which the following account will &s;hew the particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>That the Honourable the <HI>TURKEY-COMPANY,</HI> having (with no le&s;s Diligence then great Expence,) fitted forth divers Ships this Sea&s;on for the <HI>Ottoman-Trade;</HI> which as to the Glory as well as profit of the Nation, Exports the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture of Cloath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and having Freighted the Ship <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> of about 140 Tonns, Captain <HI>Sammon</HI> Commander; with near 300 Bayls of Cloath and other Merchantdi&s;e, and Bound her to the Port of <HI>Scandaroone,</HI> the extreame&s;t part of the <HI>Streights:</HI> She this Week Tyded down the River to the Road of <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> the u&s;ual &s;toppage for their clearing out from the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e;</HI> and having received her Dockets for her Di&s;charge, de&s;ign'd to &s;et forwards on her Voyage as on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 25th. In&s;tant; but behold the Providence of the Almighty, to di&s;appoint many times with unu&s;ual methods what Man directs, &s;ent a dread|full Fiery-Me&s;&s;enger to lay an Imbargo on her Voyage.</P>
<P>For on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 23d. of this in&s;tant <HI>June,</HI> between the hours of 7 and 8 at Night the Heavens were over-ca&s;t, and on a &s;udden, by the Ea&s;tward, a mighty fla&s;h of Lightning broke through the Sky, followed by a great Clap of Thun|der, and a &s;hower of Rain, and as it were, a Fire-ball, fa&s;tne'd or lodged among the Sails and Shrouds of the Ship <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> a|fore&s;aid, and inflamed with that impetuo&s;ity, that it caught hold of the Rigging thereof, which being new Tarred, in a wonderful &s;wift manner run down to the Deck or Hull of the Ship with &s;uch Fury, that the Marriners were not able to with&s;tand the Flames, &s;ome leaping into the River to &s;ave their Lives, which &s;o furiou&s;ly fa&s;tned upon the <HI>Ship,</HI> being new Pitched and Rozen'd, that the Indu&s;try of Man, tho' they had all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance po&s;&s;ible from other <HI>Ships</HI> in the Road, could not quench or extingui&s;h the lea&s;t part of her, untill &s;he burnt to the Waters Edge, whereby all her Cargo, (there being 300 Bayls of Rich Cloth, and other rich Marchandize aboard her, was intirely lo&s;t, the Dam|mage of the whole being computed to the value of 20000 <HI>l.</HI> or upwards; The account of which we have received in a Letter from the &s;ame place, as al&s;o, had it confirmed by the Merchants on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> who have al&s;o received the bad Tidings thereof.</P>
