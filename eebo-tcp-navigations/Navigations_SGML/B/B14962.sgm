<HEAD>From <HI>Rome</HI> the <HI>2.</HI> of <HI>Iune, 1632.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_ON Munday la&s;t the Cardinall of <HI>Strigonia,</HI> parted from hence homeward with little or no &s;atisfaction; The Pope never v&s;ed nor acknowledged him as an <HI>Imperiall</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor, and after his fir&s;t audience, his Holi|ne&s;&s;e would never haue him heard in the Con&s;i&s;torie, and to that end he never did call the &s;ame toge|ther; &s;o that at la&s;t, the &s;aid Cardinall being out of hope to haue any publike audience more, and having &s;pent all his mo|nies, re&s;olved (being inforced &s;o to doe) to returne home a|gaine, without any order for the de&s;ired monies for his <HI>Im|periall</HI> Maje&s;tie. For although there was &s;ent &s;ome order for 60000. Crownes vnto the <HI>Nuncio Grimaldi,</HI> yet was there &s;uch care v&s;ed, that the &s;aid money is not yet paid, and is not like to be paid &s;o &s;oone.</P>
<P>Before the &s;aid Cardinall parted, he did remon&s;trate by a writing the wrong his Holine&s;&s;e had done vnto him in &s;eve|rall poynts, e&s;pecially in not having him approved and v&s;ed as an <HI>Imperiall</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, which dignity other Cardinals in time pa&s;t haue enjoyed. Therevpon the Pope &s;aid if the like hath beene granted in times pa&s;t, now We haue rea&s;ons to the contrary, which moue vs to graunt that honour neither to you, nor to any other. True it is, We haue given way and leaue to the Cardinall <HI>de Richelieu</HI> to bee a Generall of an Ar|my, but he doth exerci&s;e that charge for the publicke good of <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and of the <HI>French</HI> King, which rea&s;ons neither you nor Cardinall <HI>Borgia</HI> can pretend.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>The Pope hath cau&s;ed a Bull to bee prepared, (though not yet publi&s;hed) whereby he doth anatematize and excommu|nicate all that take Armes again&s;t the <HI>Catholike</HI> Religion. And this the Pope hath done to ridde him&s;elfe of the importunity of the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> faction; The which neverthele&s;&s;e doth &s;till vrge him to excommunicate the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that after|wards no <HI>Catholikes</HI> would follow and &s;erue him. Yea they &s;ay (though mo&s;t impertinently) the Pope &s;hould not onely excommunicate tho&s;e that warre again&s;t the <HI>Catholicke</HI> Re|ligion, but al&s;o tho&s;e that warre again&s;t the hou&s;e of <HI>Au~|&s;tria,</HI> becau&s;e who warreth again&s;t the &s;ame (&s;ay they) doth warre again&s;t the foundation and ground of the &s;aid <HI>Catho|licke</HI> Religion; &s;o as doe the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and of <HI>Sweden:</HI> the one publickly and directly, and the other by his money and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; without the which encouragement, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> would never haue come forth out of his North-Corner, and haue over-runne all <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>At this propo&s;ition the Pope did but laugh, &s;aying: Wee that are the head of the <HI>Catholicke</HI> Religion, doe take care for the defence thereof, to pre&s;erue the &s;ame without harme. And to excommunicate and cur&s;e the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> we doe &s;ee no rea&s;on, his warre tending not to the de&s;truction of the <HI>Ca|tholicke</HI> Religion, but onely to performe what he hath pub|li&s;hed by his Manife&s;t about two yeares &s;ince: and we &s;ee, he hath taken innumerable Townes and Cities, where the <HI>Ca|tholicks</HI> haue all kind &amp; loving v&s;age, and no ho&s;tilitie at all. Oh! that the <HI>Austrian</HI> Armies had done the like in the <HI>Ca|tholickes</HI> townes they haue taken, where they haue accompli|&s;hed &s;uch cruelties and impieties, as never were heard of a|mong&s;t the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Armie: <HI>Mantoua</HI> is a fre&s;h example of the pietie of the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Armie, which hou&s;e you call the ground of the <HI>Catholicke</HI> Religion: there hath beene com|mitted &s;uch cruelties again&s;t all ages and &s;exes, &s;uch di&s;ho|nour and wickedne&s;&s;e again&s;t the women, even tho&s;e that were con&s;ecrated to God; &s;uch impiety again&s;t God &amp; his Sa|ments, and all in &s;uch an exce&s;&s;e of abomination, that the like the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> can never thinke nor dreame of, again&s;t whom you doe &s;o &s;torme, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>On the latter end of the la&s;t weeke, the Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Borgia</HI> received his royall Patent or Commi&s;&s;ion, to remaine yet three yeares Amba&s;&s;ador for <HI>Spaine:</HI> whereat the Pope was exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed. Saturday la&s;t was the day hee de&s;ired to haue audience, but the Pope &s;ent him word, that he &s;hould not come before him as Amba&s;&s;ador. And indeed the Pope hath now oftentimes &s;aid, Wee will not that Cardinals bee Amba&s;&s;adors of Princes <HI>(Lais)</HI> without our expre&s;&s;e order and licence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>True it is, that they playing on another &s;tring, doe in &s;ome &s;ort moue the Pope, when they tell him, that the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI> hath de&s;ired of the <HI>Switzers</HI> the pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Italy,</HI> &amp; that his Forces draw neere to the borders thereof. But on the o|ther &s;ide, the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King doth a&s;&s;ure his Holine&s;&s;e for the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and doth promi&s;e him all &s;afetie and friend&s;hip from that part. But becau&s;e every mans death is vncertaine, and mans will changeable, His Holine&s;&s;e there|fore will take &s;uch re&s;olution for the <HI>Papall Sea,</HI> and for the &s;afety of his per&s;on, as he &s;hall thinke &s;itte&s;t, and hath given order, that <HI>Orivetto</HI> a City in the middle of <HI>To&s;cany,</HI> and al|mo&s;t vnacce&s;&s;ible, the old <HI>Papall Pallace</HI> (where in former troubles the Popes were wont to retyre them&s;elues) &s;hould be againe prepared.</P>
<P>Cardinall <HI>&V;baldine,</HI> who had beene the maker of Cardinall <HI>Borgia</HI> his prote&s;t, hath beene driven out of <HI>Rome,</HI> and confi|ned vnto <HI>Zagarola,</HI> belonging to Cardinall <HI>Ludovi&s;io,</HI> where both out of griefe and feare, the poore man hath &s;ince lo&s;t his wit: The Pope having told him before he went out of <HI>Rome,</HI> We haue &s;o much again&s;t you, that we might cau&s;e your head to be laid before your feete, if we &s;hall doe ju&s;tice, &amp;c. But in|deed the Pope is naturally not vindicatiue, el&s;e there would haue beene cut off divers heads before this. More I dare at this time not tell you.</P>

<P>The death which &s;o vnhappily happened to the Marquis of
<PB N="4" REF="3"><HI>Baden,</HI> (who&s;e death I am extreamely grieved at, for tho&s;e rare vertues which were in him, not vn&s;it to be publi&s;hed to the world) and that thundering bullet, the fatall in&s;trument of his decea&s;e, do adverti&s;e me and put me in mind that I am mortall, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame accidents the very poore&s;t and meane&s;t of my Souldiers are &s;ubject vnto. It is a generall Law from which my Crowne, my birth, my victories are not able to re&s;cue and exempt me. There remaineth nothing el&s;e therefore, but that I mu&s;t re&s;igne my &s;elfe to the providence of the Almighty, who, if it plea&s;e him to call me out of this world, heneverthele&s;&s;e, will not abandon and leaue a cau&s;e &s;o ju&s;t as that which I haue vndertaken for the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the <HI>Germane</HI> liberties.

<P>I haue in my letter dated the 28. of Iune acquainted you

<P>On the fir&s;t of Iuly yet being bu&s;ied about this worke, and taking care to provide all things readily, &s;halloupes and boates, and Canons on the battery. The 2. day of Iuly the next morning they began to put their de&s;igne in practi&s;e, and tran&s;ported 250. <HI>German</HI> &s;ouldiers with &s;pades and mat|tocks in boates and &s;hallops, and &s;o landed on the other &s;ide. But his Excellencie hauing the night before e&s;tabli&s;hed good order and well guarded the dyke, both with hor&s;e and foote and al&s;o planted &s;ome Ordnance, and hee him&s;elfe being at hand, had vppon this place cau&s;ed the regiment of the Duke of <HI>Sandall</HI> to keepe watch, commanded by the Lieutenant <HI>Colonell</HI> Marquis <HI>De Thiau</HI> who hauing &s;uffered the enemy to land, and the boates being gone backe againe to fetch ouer more men hee with his forces which were vp|pon the dike fell vppon them that were landed with great &s;trength and furie, and in de&s;pite of the enemies Canon and Muskets which playd continually, they &s;lew mo&s;t of the enemies forces, and many were drowned all of them went to the pot except onely 103. pri&s;oners, which they brought with them into the Princes Quarter, among the&s;e pri&s;o|ners were diuers which la&s;t yeare were taken by <HI>Bergen</HI> in the great defeat. This expedition happened not without &s;ome lo&s;&s;e of our men, by rea&s;on of the Canon, and Musket &s;hott. Among the re&s;t inferiour officers voluntaryes and
<PB N="6" REF="4">common &s;oldiers, we lo&s;t Captaine <HI>Foullion</HI> who receiued three wounds of Musket &s;hott and at the la&s;t after the victo|rie in the retreat hauing brought of his men on the other &s;ide had his &s;houlder taken of with a Canon bullet.

<P>The next day being the third of <HI>Iuly,</HI> the Kings forces did againe attempt to come over, but &s;omewhat lower; but our hor&s;e vnder&s;tanding &s;o much, and they fearing lea&s;t too ma|ny of our forces were vpon the Dyke, dur&s;t not come over, but with the boates returned backe vnto their former place. The &s;ame time were by 25. of our Hor&s;e-men brought 13. pri&s;oners, and many hor&s;e, among them was one Wagoner, and one that was in commi&s;&s;ion for the obtaining of victuals, this man had about him 500. Rix-Dollars, to buy victualls in the Villages for the enemie, this proved good bootie for our Souldiers.</P>
<P>Vpon the 4. <HI>ditto</HI> &s;ome of our hor&s;e tooke and brought pri|&s;oners 106. Boores, 16. or 17. Carts, and 60. Hor&s;es; all the&s;e Boores, Carts, and hor&s;es were well laden with bread, beere, cheefe, &amp; other provant, to victuall the enemies Camp. There was a greater Convoy then this behind, but our Hor&s;e|men were too weake and dur&s;t not a&s;&s;ault them.</P>
