<HEAD>The manner of the Moones Eclip&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THe word Eclip&s;e is as much to &s;ay as to want light, and to be darkned, or hidden from our &s;ight.</P>
<P>The Moones Eclip&s;e is figured at the foote of <HI>America,</HI> over again&s;t your left hand, which is thus: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>When the Sunne and Moone are oppo&s;ite one to the other dia|metrally, and the Earth in the very mid&s;t between both: that is, when a right line drawne from the center to the Sun to the cen|ter of the Moone, pa&s;&s;eth through the center of the Earth: For the body of the Earth being thick and not tran&s;parent, ca&s;ting his &s;hadow to that point which is oppo&s;ite of the place of the Sun, will not &s;uffer the Moon to receive any light from the Sun, from whom &s;he alwaies borroweth her light: And note, that e|very time &s;he is at the full, &s;he is oppo&s;ite to the Sunne, and yet the Earth is not at every &s;uch full diametrally betwixt her &amp; the Sun, for then &s;he &s;hould be eclip&s;ed at every full, which indeed cannot be, unle&s;&s;e &s;he be either in the head or taile of the Dragon.</P>
<P>Now the Moone is eclip&s;ed in part, when the Sun, the Earth, and the Moone, be met in one &s;elfe diametrall line, but the Moon is declining either on the one &s;ide or on the other.</P>
<P>But note that eclip&s;es of the Moone may be univer&s;all, becau&s;e the Earth is far bigger than the Moone, and thereby able to &s;ha|dow her whole body,</P>

<P>When the Moone is betwixt the &s;unne and the Earth, which chanceth in a Conjunction or new of the Moone: and yet not in every Conjunction, but when it falleth either in the head or taile of the Dragon, which may chance (as is &s;aid before) either totally, or in part; totally, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e parts of the Earth whereon the &s;hadow directly falleth. For &s;ith the Moone is far le&s;&s;e than the Earth, &s;he cannot &s;hadow all the Earth, and there|fore the eclip&s;e of the &s;un cannot be univer&s;all but yet to &s;ome part of the Earth it may be totally, to &s;ome partly, and to others nothing at all; as may appeare by the afore&s;aid Figure.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Circles of this Mappe, and their u&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THe Imaginary parts of the Earth are &s;uch, which not being at all in the Earth, mu&s;t yet be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o, for the better teaching and learning this Science; and are certaine Cir|cles going about the Earth, an&s;werable to them in Heaven in name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Meridian</HI> (which comes fir&s;t to be con&s;idered) is a great Circle compa&s;&s;ing round the Earth from Pole to Pole; and is that which you &s;ee in the circumference of both Plani&s;pheares of the Map; and wherein are written the names of the Zones &amp; Climates. This chiefe, fir&s;t, fixed Meridian pa&s;&s;eth through the I&s;lands called Azores, according to the ancient Co&s;mographers; and there are two rea&s;ons why they did there begin to reckon the longitude of the Earth:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for that at that time there was no Land knowne further to the We&s;tward than that place.</P>
<P>Secondly, under that Meridian the Needle in the Mariners Compa&s;&s;e had no variation, but did point directly North and South.</P>
<P>There be al&s;o many Meridians according to the diver&s;e place in which a man lives, the number of them equall to &s;o many points as may be imagined in the Globe; but the u&s;uall &s;etting them knowne to view, is by ten degrees a&s;under; and are tho&s;e blacke lines which you &s;ee in both Plani&s;pheares, running down along from the North to the South Pole.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the Meridian, is to &s;hew the Longitude of any place. Now the longitude of a Region, City or Cape, is the di|&s;tance of it Ea&s;t from the fir&s;t great Meridian; and this ongitude is mea&s;ured and numbred in the Aequinoctiall line by Meridians from the generall and fixed Meridian, into the Ea&s;t, and contain|eth the whole compa&s;&s;e of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> 360. degrees</P>
<P>To prove this by example, ca&s;t your eye on <HI>London,</HI> and you &s;hall &s;ee it &s;omething to the Ea&s;t of the &s;econd blacke Meridian; pa&s;&s;e downe with that blacke line to the Aequinoctiall, and looke as much Ea&s;t there, as <HI>London</HI> is from that Meridian above, then count the degrees of the Aequinoctiall, from the fir&s;t great Meri|dian to that place, and that di&s;tance is the longitude of <HI>London:</HI> which you may perceive to be 20. degrees and better: And the like manner of working is to be made for all other places.</P>
<P>That <HI>line</HI> full of degrees cro&s;&s;ing both Plani&s;pheare: &s;traight a long in the middle, and dividing the world into two halfes <HI>(viz)</HI> North and South halfes; is called the <HI>Aequinoctiall line,</HI> or the Aequator; either becau&s;e it is of equall di&s;tance from both Poles of the world, or el&s;e becau&s;e the Sunne comming in this Circle makes the dayes &amp; nights throughout the world of like length; which happens upon the 10, or 11. of March, and the 13. or 14. of September. It pa&s;&s;es through Aba&s;&s;ia or <HI>Pre&s;ter Johns</HI> King|dome, and Manicongo in Africa, through the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> I&s;land Su|matra, and the Maldive I&s;les of A&s;ia; and in America, through Guiana.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of it is to &s;hew the Latitude of any Countrey, City, Promontory, or the like: Now the Latitude is the di&s;tance of a place toward the South or North, from the Aequinoctiall line or middle of the world; and is reckoned and mea&s;ured upon the Meridian toward either Pole: Tho&s;e therefore have Northerne latitude that inhabit betweene the Aequinoctiall and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">he North Pole, as they have Southerne latitude that are betweene the &s;ame Aequator and the South Pole.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>blacke lines</HI> thwarting the blacke Meridians from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, are parallels, &amp; are al&s;o called Aequidi&s;tants, being di&s;tant one from another 10. degrees toward both Poles; and are here &s;et downe for the ea&s;ier counting the latitude of any place from the Aequinoctiall: as for the <HI>latitude</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> count &s;o many decimall parallels, till you come to the parallel which is neere&s;t <HI>London,</HI> (you &s;hall find them to be five) then follow that line to the Meridian, and &s;ee the figures &s;et thereat; they are 50.) moreover, adde to that number of 50. &s;o much as <HI>London</HI> is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tu|ate
<PB REF="5" MS="y"> above that parallel, the &s;pace is one degree and a halfe; thus &s;hall you finde the latitude of <HI>London</HI> (that is, the di&s;tance thereof from the Aequator toward the North Pole) to the 51 degrees and a halfe: and in the like manner mu&s;t the Latitude of all other places be &s;ought. Thus much of Longitude and Latitude, by which two the whole earth is reckoned.</P>
<P>The Meridian and Aequinoctiall, as al&s;o the Zodiacke, are fil|led throughout with degrees, the number 360. and every degree con&s;i&s;ts of 60. Minutes, and containes, according to our ordinary account, 20. leagues, or three&s;core miles.</P>
<P>The <HI>great Circle</HI> that is drawn bending bias in one plani&s;pheare up to the Tropicke of Cancer, in the other downe to the Tropick of Capricorne, is the Zodiacke; it is repleni&s;hed with degrees, and beares on it the Characters of the 12. &s;ignes.</P>
<P>The u&s;es of it are to &s;hew over what Countries and people the body and beames of the Sunne come perpendicular at &s;ome times or other in the yeare; and it &s;hews to all (where the dayes increa&s;e and decrea&s;e) the longe&s;t and &s;horte&s;t dayes of the yeare, for the Sunne (which cau&s;eth the &s;ame) being alwayes in this Circle, and therein moving about one degree a day, all the while he is comming up from the Tropicke of Capricorne to that of Cancer, the dayes increa&s;e in the Northerne Climates; but contrariwi&s;e in his cour&s;e backe from Cancer to Capricorne, they &s;horten to us, and lengthen to tho&s;e in the Southerne Climates; and this Circle &s;hewes the foure quarters of the yeare; Spring, Summer, Autumne, Winter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Cancer,</HI> (&s;o called, or the Coele&s;tiall &s;igne Can|cer) is a circle, who&s;e di&s;tance from the Aequinoctiall toward the North, is 23. degrees and a halfe. When the Sunne is come &s;o farre Northward as to touch this Circle, then is our longe&s;t day in the yeare.</P>
<P>It pa&s;&s;es through the Southermo&s;t parts of Barbary &amp; Aegypt, Arabia, India, China, <HI>Nova Hi&s;pania,</HI> and the I&s;land Cuba.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tropicke of Capricorne,</HI> (likewi&s;e &s;o named of the &s;igne Ca|pricorne in the &s;tarry heaven) is a circle of like di&s;tance at the o|ther Tropicke from the Aequinoctiall Southward, that is 23. de|grees and a halfe.

<HEAD>The Zones.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Zone</HI> is a &s;pace of Earth, contained betweene two of the &s;maller circles, or within the compa&s;&s;e of either polar Cir|cle: the name &s;ignifies as much as a girdle, by rea&s;on that each Zone compa&s;&s;eth about the earth in manner of a girdle. Of the&s;e there be two kinds, one temperate, the other untemperate.</P>
<P>There be two temper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">e Zones; the one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North temperate Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> is that &s;pace of Earth contained be|tweene the Tropicke of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ncer, and the North polar Circle.</P>
<P>The <HI>South temperate Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> is that &s;pace of earth &s;tretched along betweene the Tropicke of Capricorne, and the South Polar Cir|cle.</P>
<P>They are called temper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> Zones, for that the ayre thereof hath a farre better and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="4 letters">erate temperature, and meeter for man to inhabit, than t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">temperate Zones. The breadth of them is 43. degrees a piece, which degrees, make either temperate Zone to be 2580. Engli&s;h miles broad apiece.</P>
<P>The <HI>untemperate Zones</HI> are twofold; one exceeding in the ex|tremity of heat, the other as much in cold; they have bin thought in former times altogether uncharitable, but latter experience hath found them more fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> for habitation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Torrid or burnt Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> (which is the hot untemperate Zone) is that &s;pace of heaven which you &s;ee contained betweene the Tropicke of Cancer, and that of Capricorne. It hath the name of <HI>Torrid,</HI> becau&s;e the Sunne continually pa&s;&s;es thereover, and ca|&s;ting downe direct rayes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ects it with a marvellous heate; there|by making it not &s;o convenient for the Inhabitants, as the tem|perate Zones are. The breadth of this Zone is comprehended be|tweene the two Tropickes, and containes 47. degrees, that is of Engli&s;h miles 2820.</P>
<P>The <HI>frozen Zones</HI> are &s;paces of Earth inclo&s;ed within either of the Polar circles: of the&s;e there are two, one North, the other South.</P>
<P>The <HI>North fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">zen Zone,</HI> is that &s;pace of Earth contained within the compa&s;&s;e of the North Polar circle.

<P>The <HI>South frozen Zone,</HI> is that &s;pace of Earth compa&s;&s;ed all a+bout with the South Polar circle: It hath the like breadth from the South Pole, as the other frozen Zone hath from the North Pole and likewi&s;e the number of miles is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>They are called <HI>frozen Zones,</HI> becau&s;e they (for the mo&s;t part) exceed in cold; and that is cau&s;ed in regard that the Sunne, for a good part of the yeare, is under the Horizon, and &s;ees them not; and when he is come up into their &s;ight, his appearance (which is for a pretty long &s;ea&s;on together) rather comforts them, than any vertuall heat proceeding from him; for there th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> ayre is &s;tuft with thicke foggy vapours, and his beames at highe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> fall but very oblikely on them; &s;o that what through his want and unability to di&s;pel the cold, and the colds force to re&s;i&s;t and beare backe the Suns heate; the&s;e Zones remaine almo&s;t unhabi|table, and even (as the word is) frozen.</P>

So that there are foure and twenty Climats, con&s;i&s;ting of forty eight Parallels, ere the day come to be 24. houres in length, which is twelve houres longer than the ordinary Aequinoctiall day is. Now this is to be under|&s;tood; Under the Aequinoctiall line, and 13, degrees, that is 3.
