<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THis handful of my Gleanings I have here &s;cattered a|mong you, and if you judge them worth the gathering, take them, and welcome: if not, leave them, and there's no hurt done; For my own particu|lar, I hold it le&s;s criminal
<PB REF="4">to &s;port away the tedious houres with the dalliance of my Pen, than to live be|&s;otted with black Melan|choly Yet as I am not of <HI>Heraclitus</HI> his humour, to whine away my dayes; no more am I of <HI>Democritus</HI> his temper, to laugh out my time; but now and then to unbend my &s;elf with mode|rate relaxation, is my ab|&s;olute temper and con&s;titu|tion. <HI>Semel in anno ridet Apollo:</HI> The God of Wi&s;|dom is merry once a year, and why may not I? there is no rea&s;on to the contrary in my judgement, e&s;pecially
<PB REF="4">&s;ince that no man I pre&s;ume, wil be offended at my mirth, unle&s;s he be a Spaniard: Now how it may move his admirable choller, I am al|together in&s;en&s;ible, yet I am confident, if he be but fur|ni&s;hed with &s;o much patience as to peru&s;e it, he will un|doubtedly like &s;ome, and that is as much as I can ei|ther expect or de&s;ire: I have here painted them with Spa|ni&s;h Wooll, &s;et them forth in their own colours, as far as lay within the compa&s;s of my power and &s;o &s;mall a Vo|lume.</P>
<P>As for my labor herein, I
<PB REF="5">much dete&s;t &s;o &s;ickly an im|potency, as to overwean my &s;elf with a conceipt of my own Work; but if the truly judicious, who are ever ac|companied with a clear per|&s;picacity, and a milde cen|&s;ure, &s;hall courteou&s;ly receive it, I am crown'd: But if any left-handed <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> (who compel the Pen men of this Age, as they did the ancient Comoedians, to make u&s;e of Apologies in lieu of Prologues) &s;hall &s;i|ni&s;terly accept what is vo|luntarily and kindly offered to their &s;urvey, I onely de|&s;ire that they may be endow|ed
<PB REF="5">with that other mute qua|lification of the <HI>Pythagore|ans, viz.</HI> Silence.</P>
<P>As for the mi&s;takes that I may here be accu&s;ed of, if convinced of them, I will ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s them, and doubt not of pardon, &s;ince I have &s;o good a Solici|tor in the eye of any that are but moderately courteous, as my own infancy in re&s;pect of maturity of judgement. Be&s;ides, this will plead my excu&s;e, the pure&s;t eye can|not di&s;cern its own blemi&s;h|es, unle&s;s by reflection; the Moon hath her macula's or &s;pots; <HI>Venus</HI> had her mole,
<PB REF="6">and all per&s;ons their failings, therfore for me to have com|mitted no faults, had been to put off man</P>
<P>But if any in the proca|city of ignoble Envy (oc|ca&s;ioned u&s;ually by a de&s;pair of Imitation) continue to be farther contumelious, I &s;hall pa&s;s it by, knowing that a little a&s;&s;umed Soloeci&s;me will &s;erve my turn; and I with a kinde of deaf con|tempt will pa&s;s by the out|rages of their ob&s;treperous clamor, undi&s;turb'd. Thus you have my re&s;olution, and now I have no more to do, but bid you</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>CHARACTER</HI> OF SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>TIs Nature's Sweating-tub, a Ne&s;t of Wolves, the very Seat of Hun|ger and Famine, a place where never any <HI>Lotus</HI> grew; for be confident no per&s;on that ever travell'd thither, de&s;ired to make it his place of re&s;idence; or when once pa&s;t her bounds, was ever prompted by his fancy to a &s;econd Vi&s;it; for who&s;oever goes thither may be &s;aid <HI>to come out of

'Tis an excellent Countrey to travel in, for you &s;hall &s;carce meet with Meat for money, but Sawce good &s;tore, nor an Inne to entertain you; for the Ma&s;ter and the Mule u&s;ually lodge together, and the latter perhaps meets with better fare then the former.</P>

<P>As for the Natives, and fir&s;t their Sovereign, he boa&s;ts that he hath the Sun for his Cre&s;t; but 'tis certain that mo&s;t of his Sub|jects bear the Moon cre&s;cent, for all the &s;trict Confinement of their Wives: Pride, Haughti|ne&s;s and Ambition, accompanied with an imaginary conceit of their own peculiar <HI>Grandeza,</HI> are the Ingredients that u&s;ually go to the compo&s;ition of a Spaniard; &s;o that it is hard to judge whe|ther the Countrey, or the mindes of the Inhabitants are mo&s;t a&s;pi|ring and mountainous. They are <HI>Saturnine,</HI> dull, &s;low, melancho|lick, and altogether &s;peculative, aiming at no other <HI>terminus ad quem,</HI> then Contemplation, with|out afterwards directing or &s;et|ling it upon any &s;ervile, inferior, or mechanick work or employ|ment;
<PB N="4" REF="8">&s;o that you &s;hall finde few natural Spaniards of any me|chanick Trade, as Shoemakers, Taylors, Coblers, Joyners, Inn|keepers, or the like; for which I call all Travellers to witne&s;s that go into <HI>Spain,</HI> and return offended, becau&s;e they finde no Ale-hou&s;es or Inns upon the way as they do in other Countreys, &s;o that they are compell'd to be their own Providores, and carry Victuals in their bags, and Wine in their bottles; for they delight infinitely in their imagin'd <HI>Gran|deza,</HI> outward appearances and honor, not at all regarding their private intere&s;t, &s;o that they can but create unto them&s;elves the opinion and e&s;teem of the world; and if they want good Apparel, and biting penury nips them, they will fa&s;t two or three days for a
<PB N="5" REF="8">hand&s;om Cloak, or a &s;tarch'd Ruff, and then &s;trut it abroad in &s;tate; &s;o deliberately do they mea&s;ure their way, as if they &s;aid a <HI>Pater No&s;ter</HI> or an <HI>Ave Maria</HI> between every &s;tep, and if he be &s;o far &s;timulated by that Tyrant <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,</HI> that he mu&s;t vend his clothes to buy him food, he will fir&s;t part with his Shirt, becau&s;e that with his Doublet &amp; Ruff he covers the want of it; then if his needs increa&s;e, off goes his Dou|blet, covering his body with his Cloak; next his Sword; after that his Ruff, and la&s;t of all his Cloak, till he has never a one left to co|ver his pride and knavery, and this is their method which exi|gencies prompts them to. His pride, when reduced to the ut|mo&s;t extent of poverty, <HI>viz.</HI> beg|gery, is infamous; for he will
<PB N="6" REF="9">never confe&s;s that nece&s;&s;ity, but &s;ome ca&s;ualty or misfortune com|pell'd him to it; as, that he was forced to cloath him&s;elf in the&s;e de&s;picable weeds to pre&s;erve his life, and his honor: and thus to play the Fryar Mendicant, when he craves your charity, it &s;hall be in the&s;e or the like terms, May it plea&s;e you Sir, to do &s;ome courte&s;ie for a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Cava|liero, that hath de&s;erted his na|tive countrey for &s;uch and &s;uch a mi&s;chance, and been con&s;trained to &s;hew him&s;elf in this misbe&s;ee|ming garb; and when you are certified of the quality of the per&s;on that craves your Alms (as long it will not be) you will think your &s;elves happy in relieving &s;o noble a per&s;on as I am: and if perchance he that hears him, de|mands who he is? he will reyly,

Nor do the females come &s;hort of them in pride or arrogancy, which may be &s;ufficiently evinced by this en&s;uing Relation that <HI>Bar|clay</HI> in his <HI>Euphormio</HI> affords me. 'Tis a &s;tory of a poor mi&s;erable Spani&s;h woman, that coming with her family (her three &s;onnes I mean) to beg of a French Shoe|maker, he being compa&s;sionate told her, he would ea&s;e her of her charge, and take one of her &s;ons from her, and make him of his own profe&s;sion, that &s;o he might be able to get a compe|tency, whereby he might main|tain him&s;elf hand&s;omly: She with a great deal of indignation replied, O Sir, God forbid I
<PB N="9" REF="10">&s;hould ca&s;t away my childe on a &s;tranger, of &s;o mechanick a pro|fe&s;sion as yours is; who knows, but in time he may come to be Viceroy of <HI>Naples,</HI> or <HI>Mexico.</HI> So horribly are they puft up with the timpany of pride, that they are the greate&s;t enemies under the &s;un to their own preferment: Go but into their <HI>Ca&s;a de Locos,</HI> or Bedlam, and you &s;hall hear one cry, <HI>I will be King;</HI> another, <HI>I am Emperor;</HI> and a third, <HI>I am Pope:</HI> all which verifies our Eng|li&s;h Proverb, <HI>That which is bred in the bone, will ne're out of the fle&s;h.</HI> Nay, their pride is &s;o infa|mous, that it is grown common, even to a Proverb, indebted to them for being &s;o; for they have a vaporing &s;aying of them&s;elves in point of valour, <HI>Un E&s;pannol &s;on quatro Diables en Francia.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="11">One Spaniard can act the part of four devils in <HI>France.</HI> And when <HI>Mendoza</HI> was Amba&s;&s;adour in <HI>France,</HI> he would often break out into this prophane O&s;tentation; <HI>Dios es Podero&s;o en Cielo, y Don Felipe en Tierra:</HI> God bears &s;way in Heaven, and King <HI>Philip</HI> on Earth: So daringly pre&s;umptious are they, as to make God their fellow-creature.

So &s;elf-conceited are they of their own imaginary dignity and de&s;erts, that they judge no Nation fit to come in competition with them. I will borrow a Story of one of our rarely accompli&s;h'd Gentle|men,
<PB N="11" REF="11">concerning a Ca&s;tilian Ca|pitain, who u&s;ed to expre&s;s him|&s;elf in this en&s;uing maner: When I de&s;cend into my &s;elf, and con|template my mo&s;t horrible ter|rible terribility, I can hardly con|tain my &s;elf within my &s;elf: The&s;e Breeches that I wear are ftu&s;t with Capitains Beards, and the Mu&s;tacho's of French Gene|rals; my Pillow is filled with Amazonian hair, my Cu&s;hion is made of a Turban taken off of the Grand Sultan's head, my Co|verlet is the skin of the Nemean Lion that <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;lew, my Cur|tains are made up of Colours and En&s;igns taken in divers Battels: When I march into the fields, I commonly carry two Drums, as Pendents at my ears; I am lull'd a&s;leep by the noi&s;e of Trumpets, and bra&s;s Kettles; and <HI>Perillus</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="12">his Bull &s;trecht along, &s;erves me for a Pillow: I was born in the moneth of <HI>Mars,</HI> who was then the predominant Planet, and A&s;cendant: I came into the world about break of day; <HI>Sol</HI> him&s;elf then &s;uffered an Eclip&s;e, <HI>Jove</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> hid them&s;elvs, and <HI>Cynthia</HI> withdrew her horns for fear; that morning it rained blood; the &s;treams of the great|e&s;t Rivers turn'd red; <HI>Mongibel</HI> and <HI>Strombola</HI> belch'd forth more fire then ordinarily: Near the place I was nurft in, there was a Den of Lions, that I might be mur'd to their roaring; and one time my mother cau&s;ed a young Cub to be &s;lain, on purpo&s;e to feed me with the blood thereof. To conclude, I am that invinci|ble, tran&s;cendent, great Capitain <HI>Ba&s;ili&s;co E&s;pheramonte,</HI> Genera|li&s;&s;imo
<PB N="13" REF="12">of all the Militia of <HI>Eu|rope:</HI> I am he that u&s;eth to &s;wal|low Mountains, breathe Whirle|windes, &s;pit Targets, and &s;weat Quick-&s;ilver: I believe all the Notaries in <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> in three years &s;pace cannot ca&s;t up tho&s;e mira|culous Atchievements, which I the Scourge of <HI>Lutherans,</HI> Con|verter of Pagans, and Peopler of Church-yards, have performed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Would not any one imagine that <HI>Ovids</HI> gho&s;t were rambled hither, and by a Pythagorean Metemp&s;ycho&s;is tran&s;migrated into this Per&s;on, all that oppo&s;|eth this conjecture is onely this, that the one writ in undige&s;ted rough pro&s;e, and the other in &s;oft &s;weet ver&s;e, this modern, hath quite out-fabled the ancient <HI>Ovid. Thra&s;o</HI> him&s;elf where he
<PB N="14" REF="13">intervives, dur&s;t not come in competition with this <HI>Bragadocio</HI> Ca&s;tilian, &s;uch a piece of prodi|gious &s;elf-conceitedne&s;s as this, the world ne're heard of. Ano|ther &s;trange kind of temper di&s;|crepant from all Nations they have, and that is this, as great an argument of their haughtine&s;s, as any of the preceding If any one &s;hould demand an account in a &s;trange Countrey concerning any of the Natives, though never &s;o mean, nay the &s;on of a Cobler, he will reply, And is't po&s;&s;ible, &s;ir, that you &s;hould not know that Cavalier? Did you never hear of him? And all this nay more, though he be but one of their &s;un|bak't Pea&s;ants I dare lay a wa|ger there is not a Child in the City or Kingdome five years old, but knows him, at lea&s;t, if he be
<PB N="15" REF="13">&s;prung of noble Patents. You &s;hall therefore under&s;tand, Sir, (then he begins to be the fal&s;e Herald of his forged fame) that he is Son to the <HI>Maggiora&s;co</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and one of the mo&s;t no|ble families that <HI>Spain</HI> can boa&s;t of, and there are many that con|fidently pronounce him &s;econd Co&s;in to King <HI>Philip:</HI> yet doth he go di&s;gu&s;ed in the&s;e weeds, that he may be undi&s;cerned by the &s;earching eye of the vulgar: be|&s;ides I mu&s;t engage you to &s;ilence in this bu&s;ine&s;s, for if the King &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible in the lea&s;t of his re&s;idence here, he would take it hainou&s;ly that he did not alight at Court a&s;&s;oon as he arrived: But he that will di&s;cour&s;e of all particulars on this &s;ubject, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;well into a volume, wherefore I will wind all up
<PB N="16" REF="14">upon a &s;mall bottom. Now for the nature of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> they are compo&s;ed of fancy, and an affected gravity, under which lurks &s;tore of arrogancy, you &s;hall have one of a dunghil|brood &s;tand on tip-toe, twerling his Mu&s;tachos &s;ay, <HI>Voto a tal io &s;oy tan burno ce mo el Rey Don Felipe,</HI> I &s;wear by <HI>Jupiter Am|mon,</HI> that I am in as good a condition as King <HI>Philip;</HI> nor will &s;ome of them &s;cruple the &s;aying, that they will walk arm'd in Pa|radi&s;e, but 'tis to be feared they are no birds of Paradi&s;e, and &s;o there is very little probability of of their ne&s;tling there. You &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome of their Dons pacing of it with abundance of gravity, en|viron'd with a croud of Servitors, or more properly, va&s;&s;alls, two before him, one holds his hat up|on
<PB N="17" REF="14">occa&s;ion, another his cloak, if it chance to rain, another carries a clout to rub his Ginnet while&s;t he is at Ma&s;s, another a Curry|comb to kemb his Mane, and all the&s;e when they come home, will be content with a cru&s;t of bread, and a radi&s;h apiece for their re|pa&s;t. They have a &s;aying of the French (between whom there is a very &s;trange antipathy, and that irreconcilable too; <HI>Al primer impetu &s;on mas que hombres, y de|&s;pues menos que mugeres.</HI> Their fir&s;t on&s;et manife&s;ts them more then men, but their la&s;t le&s;s then women. But they to requite their kindne&s;s, have an ill-favor'd &s;ay|ing of them, <HI>That the Spaniards in point of true active valor, are but bearded women.</HI></P>
<P>Now as to their habit and garb, they u&s;ually go clo&s;e buttoned,
<PB N="18" REF="15">nor will they unbutton though fire fall from heaven. Their Col|lar is very clo&s;e, as if they inten|ded that &s;aying in the &s;acred Code, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> All things are bare neckt to God. He u&s;ually wears that upon his arms, which others do on their thighs, <HI>viz.</HI> long &s;leeves, and &s;hort breeches: be&s;ides, he wears his &s;tockings &s;o clo&s;e and &s;treight to his Leg, that you cannot take hold of them with a pair of pin|cers: As for their ge&s;ture in the &s;treet, if there be a company, they march two by two, as if they went in proce&s;sion to &s;ome Saint, or Lady, and that &s;o &s;lowly, that you would judge them to be newly recovered of a Quartan-Ague; and 'tis beyond the power of whip or &s;taff to quicken their pace. As for their &s;peech, they
<PB N="19" REF="15">are &s;o helli&s;hly ambitious, as to &s;ay that when God forbad <HI>Adam</HI> eating of the tree of knowledge, he &s;poke in Spani&s;h, &s;uch is their imperiou&s;ne&s;s and arrogancy; but I am an enemy to tediou&s;ne&s;s, e&s;pecially while&s;t I am under the name of a Character; therefore to &s;ome other particulars.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t let's make a Pa&s;s at the Je&s;uite, that plays the <HI>Ma|chiavilian</HI> both in Church and State, tho&s;e grand Supporters of the Spani&s;h Crown, which made a Burgundian Gentleman &s;ay, <HI>Un E&s;pagnol &s;ans &s;on Je&s;uite e&s;t com|me un Perdrix &s;ans Orange.</HI> A Spaniard without a Je&s;uite at his elbow in con&s;ultation, is like Powder'd-beef without mu&s;tard. Define them we need not, &s;ince 'tis done already to our hands by <HI>Alexander Hays,</HI> one of their
<PB N="20" REF="16">own Order, and 'tis this; <HI>Je&s;uita e&s;t omnis home:</HI> They are <HI>Pluto's</HI> prime Agents, that labor tooth and nayl to people his infernal Territories, and adde Va&s;&s;als to his gloomy maje&s;ty.

They are the <HI>Umbra</HI> of the Nobility, in&s;epa|rable a&s;&s;ociates, that follow them as a &s;hadow doth the bodies, which is the rea&s;on of the nume|rous Legacies that are conferr'd upon them, yet they are like tho&s;e little animals <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;peaks of, <HI>qua mordent, &amp; non &s;entiun|tur:</HI> For where&s;oever they get footing or entertainment, they prejudice by in&s;en&s;ible encroach|ments,
<PB N="21" REF="16">though the party &s;hall not judge him&s;elf hurt, or damaged in the lea&s;t. And as to their dam|nable Inqui&s;ition, if you are re|&s;olved upon a Di&s;pute concern|ing any Doctrine held by the Roman Church, they will retort with a Syllogi&s;m of Hemp, or Fire, which is far more har&s;h then one in <HI>Barbara,</HI> or <HI>Baroco,</HI> and fitter for devils then men. And though they are &s;o much in e&s;teem with the Pope, yet are they maligned and flouted at by the vulgar, as appears by the Pa&s;|quils no le&s;s various, then inge|nious and tart, that are be&s;towed on them in every place, which is apparent to any one that is but a mean Hi&s;torian. When they fir&s;t negotiated in <HI>France</HI> for footing in <HI>Paris,</HI> they were askt, whether they were <HI>Seculares,</HI> or <HI>Regulares?</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="17">and replied, <HI>Tales, Quales,</HI> &s;uch and &s;uch, which remain; upon re|cord a Nick-name to them even to this very day. But what the &s;ubject be&s;towed on them with the tongue, they fetcht out of their Soveraign's teeth (King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth I mean) they began to take a cour&s;e that he might be hit in the teeth with no|thing, by endeavoring to beat them all out; for a young Je&s;uite green in growth, but old in vil|lany, &s;tabb'd him in the mouth, though it happened with the lo&s;s of one onely tooth; whereupon the King &s;aid merrily, <HI>Falloit il que les Je&s;uites fu&s;&s;ent convanicus par ma bouche?</HI> Mu&s;t they needs be convinced by my mouth?

<P>There happened one day a very facetious, quipping pa&s;&s;age be|twixt King <HI>Philip</HI> and a Veteran Capitain, that had &s;erved him a long time in the <HI>Belgian</HI> Wars, who being deferr'd by the Coun|cel of State, was re&s;olved to find out his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, who was then at the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> and as for|tune would have it, hunting; where mounted on his Mule, and meeting the King &s;ingle in the field, the King began to enter|tain Di&s;cour&s;e with him: fir&s;t,

No, &s;aid the Capitain: then replied the King, I am clearly of opinion, that he will &s;carce give you any thing &s;ince he hath &s;ati&s;|fied you in your arrears, and prin|cipally becau&s;e he is infinitely indebted, and hath many de&s;igns to put forward; at which the Capitain broke off abruptly, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Pues que me be&s;e la mula en el culo:</HI> Then let him, ki&s;s my Mule in the tayl; and &s;o was ri|ding away, but the King call'd
<PB N="63" REF="37">him back, and ask'd him what Petition he had made, or what cour&s;e he had taken for &s;atisfa|ction? He told him that he had often attended the Councel of State, and War, with his Memo|rials, but was never the near, nor could he ever procure the &s;ight of his Maje&s;ty there, nor el&s;e|where. Very good, &s;aid the King, the Councel &s;its to morrow, and I &s;hall be there pre&s;ent, for I have an Office there; wherefore if you come I &s;hall procure your entrance, and then you may make your Addre&s;s to <HI>Don Philip</HI> in per&s;on. The King the very next day did pre&s;ide him&s;elf in Coun|cel, and gave &s;trict order, that if &s;uch a per&s;on, de&s;cribing him of &s;uch a name, (for that he had lear|ned of him by their Conference) &s;hould chance to be at the door,
<PB N="64" REF="38">he &s;hould be admitted: the Ca|pitain coming, and having enter|ance, &s;eeing the Councel bare, and knowing this to be the King with whom he had private di&s;|cour&s;e ye&s;terday, he was not much out of countenance: Immediate|ly <HI>Philip</HI> ask't him, whether he remembered the di&s;cour&s;e that was between them in the field? Yes Sir, replies the Capitain; then, &s;aid he, you cannot forget what you &s;aid: <HI>That if the King would not reward you, he might ki&s;s your Mule in the breech:</HI> Sir, replied he, <HI>Seno lo dicho, dichio, mi Mula e&s;ta debaxo a la puerta:</HI> What I &s;aid, I &s;aid, and Mule &s;tands below at the back gate: The King was not at all di&s;turb'd but gave him his hand to ki&s;s, and caus'd him to be nobly reward|ed.

<PB N="78" REF="45">putant, quam eo, quam revera &s;unt.</HI> And yet what are the&s;e <HI>Portu|gals?</HI> a rude rabble or pack of &s;laves; for the number of them in &s;ome places are very near as great, if not more then the inha|bitants; And there are very few places where there is &s;o little di|&s;tinction among them; for they &s;carce make any difference be|tween men and bea&s;t, and they are both &s;old in the market at an equal rate, &s;o that they may law|fully be term'd a Crew of Hea|thens, or Pagans, notwith&s;tand|ing their pretended zeal to Reli|gion. But that is but a fair pre|tence to &s;et off their vill any the better, a meer ceremony among them, and indeed &s;o much cere|mony, that it hath almo&s;t eaten out the &s;ub&s;tance of Religion, Bible, Alchoran, Talmud, or Gol|den
<PB N="79" REF="45">Legion, all's one; Religion &s;erves but for a meer Stratagem, and their Prie&s;ts, that were or|dained (or at lea&s;t &s;hould be) to exorci&s;e devils, are the greate&s;t fiends, and &s;hould, if rightly &s;er|ved, be ca&s;t out them&s;elves. But now, as to the foundation of their imagined <HI>Grandeza,</HI> that they have brought their Government unto, as they imagine: The very form thereof is very unplea&s;ing to a &s;ubject, for they had rather rule by fear than love, and where &s;he acquires any of the latter, it is drawn as a thread through the eye of a needle out of the appre|hen&s;ion of fear: it being one of their State-maxims, That Obe|dience proceeding from &s;uch a love, is the &s;ure&s;t and &s;afe&s;t, in regard that Fear being the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t careful Governe&s;s

<P>Nay farther, the chief and high|e&s;t Mini&s;ters they employ, are &s;o much for their private lucre, and &s;elf-intere&s;t, (which mo&s;t com|monly proves the de&s;truction of a Kingdom) that it is grown to a Proverb, <HI>Some of them gnaw, o|thers eat, and &s;ome devour, where they are deputed to &s;ignorize and govern.</HI> But, now 'tis time to change our &s;ubject, and to be a little more milde in their De|&s;cription and Character.</P>
<P>In this fore-going Di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="81" REF="46">you have &s;een their mo&s;t hainous Vices, cruel Plots, helli&s;h De|&s;igns, and barbarous Enterprizes; as al&s;o their imperious Mindes, proud and haughty Spirits, their ba&s;e Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions, and their depraved Natures, er|roneous Tenets, and wicked Cu|&s;toms; Now that we may not be thought to be altogether made up of &s;pleen and choler, and to have dipt our pen in <HI>aqua-fortis,</HI> or vinegar, we &s;hall take a &s;hort &s;urvey of their Virtues, and no|ble Qualifications, to the end we may demon&s;trate unto you that they have &s;omewhat among them, which may merit commen|dation as well as condemnation. And fir&s;t, the Soyl is healthful, having for a long time a con&s;tant &s;erene Ayr, which made the Prince of Greek Poets, and &s;e|veral
<PB N="82" REF="47">other Authors place the <HI>E|li&s;ian fields</HI> here; for there are no gro&s;s, caligmous vapors ri&s;ing up from Bogs or Fens, but there are mo&s;t refre&s;hing, &s;oft <HI>Zephyres</HI> or Breezes, that pierce the cir|cumambient Air, and enliven both man and bea&s;t; nay, Mari|ners that u&s;e to traver&s;e tho&s;e Seas, can tell when they approach the coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain</HI> by the odori|&s;erous &s;mel of Ro&s;emary, &amp; other Aromatick Vegetals that grow there up and down the common fields, and perfume the Air with their fragrancy: She is not parcht with &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive heat as <HI>Afri|ca,</HI> nor &s;haken with &s;uch impe|tuous windes as <HI>France,</HI> nor to&s;|&s;ed with &s;uch earthquakes as <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> nor nipt and pincht by the be|numming thumbs of Winter, as <HI>Holland, Swethland,</HI> and &s;everal
<PB N="83" REF="47">other Regions; but enjoys a mo|derate and temperate Air. <HI>Spain</HI> abounds with the mo&s;t generous Wines, and the be&s;t Oyls; as al&s;o the be&s;t Fruits, as Figs, Rai|&s;ins, Almonds, Orenges, Lemons, and Pomegrannets, and all other kinde of Vegetables, as Herbs, Roots, and Flowers. Be&s;ides her bowels are richly furni&s;hed with Mettals, as Iron, Steel, Quick|&s;ilver, and Gold. She produceth good Silk, Flax, an excellent Wooll, though they are behold|ing to us for that commodity.</P>
<P>Now for that generous Ani|mal the Hor&s;e, &s;he &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all Countreys; for their <HI>Cordovan Gjnnets</HI> excel tho&s;e of <HI>Turkey</HI> for fiercene&s;s; tho&s;e of <HI>Barbary</HI> for their light feet, or nimble heels, as we term it; and tho&s;e of <HI>Italy</HI> in comline&s;s of proportion. Her
<PB N="84" REF="48">&s;tately Fabricks, Structures, and Cities, are as numerous as &s;tate|ly; which occa&s;ioned the Pro|verb, <HI>Quien no ha vi&s;to Sevilla, non ha vi&s;to Maravilla: Quien no ha vi&s;to Lisboa?, no ha vi&s;to co&s;a boa.</HI> He that ne're &s;aw <HI>Sevil,</HI> ne're &s;aw a miracle; and he that ne're &s;aw <HI>Lisbon,</HI> ne're &s;aw any thing that was rare; but the ca|dency of the words in the Span|i&s;h, is far more harmonious than in the Engli&s;h Dialect. To prove which, I need mention but one, and that is the Mona&s;tery of <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> near the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> which for matter and form is not to be parallel'd. <HI>Claudian</HI> breaks out into an Elogium of her, which concludes thus:</P>
<Q><HI>Dives equis, frugum facilis, pre|tio&s;a metallis.</HI></Q>
<PB N="85" REF="48">
<P>The patience of the Spaniard is commendable; their valor no|table; their fidelity very &s;ignal, which was the rea&s;on that <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> us'd to have a Guard of them, and <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> a Band of <HI>Bi&s;cayners</HI> or <HI>Cantabrians</HI> about him. In their Military di&s;cipline they are admirable, very &s;trict and &s;evere, and obedient to their Commanders; as may appear by that Spani&s;h Centinel, who was found dead in the morning in a tower upon the Cittadel of <HI>Ant|werp,</HI> with his musket in his hand, in a defen&s;ive po&s;ture, &amp; &s;tanding on his legs upright, like one that was alive and in health to their &s;eeming, yet all frozen. Be&s;ides, they are infinitely carefull of their National Honor, and very indu&s;trious to promote it. For their Di&s;coveries of other Coun|treys,
<PB N="86" REF="49">they have had great &s;uc|ce&s;s, and rendred them&s;elves fa|mous thereby. And though they have received va&s;t heaps of gold and &s;ilver from the <HI>Americans,</HI> in requital whereof, that they might not be altogether ingrate|ful, they received Chri&s;tianity, and we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e civiliz'd by them, when as before the Savages did re&s;em|ble bruit bea&s;ts more than ratio|nal men.</P>
<P>It was the Spani&s;h Navigation that fir&s;t confuted that erroneous opinion, that there were no &s;uch per&s;ons in <HI>e&s;&s;e,</HI> as the <HI>Antipodes;</HI> when as be ore there was a Bi|&s;hop impri&s;on'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> for ve|rifying this now uncontrovertible Tenet, which is under&s;tood al|mo&s;t by every plebeian. The Friars in the We&s;t, and the Je|&s;uites in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> fir&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="49">planted Chri&s;tian Religion, and cultivated tho&s;e parts, and made a fruitful vineyard of them, bap|ti&s;ing them in the Laver of rege|neration; nay, it is credibly repor|ted, that one &s;ingle Franci&s;can Frier did chri&s;ten 400000 of them. And though the Proverb hath it, <HI>E&s;pania las Armas, Italia lapluma. Spain</HI> is more for the pike, then the pen, yet they have produc'd &s;ome famous lights of the Church, as <HI>Fulgentius, I&s;io|dore, Paulus Oro&s;ius, Ju&s;tinian,</HI> and others, and &s;ome Rabbies, though of different &s;ect, yet may they have a place in the <HI>Cata|logue</HI> of learned men, as Rabbi <HI>David Chimcho,</HI> Rabbi <HI>Abenez|ra,</HI> and Rabbi <HI>Ma&s;es,</HI> and more that might be mention'd.</P>
<P>Now for eminent Doctors in the Civil Law, &s;he hath brought up
<PB N="88" REF="50">no &s;mall number, as <HI>Alvarus Vala&s;cus Goveaneus,</HI> that is con|fe&s;t, and approv'd of for the be&s;t, and true&s;t interpreter that ever commented upon <HI>Ju&s;tinian, Ca|lixtus</HI> the third, and <HI>Pinellus.</HI></P>
<P>As for Phy&s;ick &s;he hath pro|duc'd many that have bin very eminent, as <HI>Garcias ab Horto, Averroes</HI> of <HI>Cordova, Chri&s;topher a Vega, Avicenna</HI> of <HI>Sevil,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nor hath &s;he bin de&s;titute of Philo&s;ophers, witne&s;s <HI>Seneca</HI> who tran&s;cended, and &s;urpa&s;s't all his Predece&s;&s;ors and Po&s;terity hi|therto in precepts of morality, &amp; many more that might be men|tion'd. She hath flouri&s;ht with &s;tore of Poets that de&s;erv'd the Bays, as <HI>Silius, Italicus, Lucan,</HI> and &s;everal others that might be &s;pecified.</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> the Rhetorician was an
<PB N="89" REF="50">off-&s;pring of their own, who was famous for his tenacious memory and &s;everal famous Hi&s;torians, as well as Orators, <HI>Ju&s;tinus</HI> the great, <HI>Trogus Pomperus, Ludovi|cus Vives, Pomponius Mela Mar|tial Columella,</HI> and <HI>Fabius Quin|tilianus.</HI> All which, have added very much to the Republick of Literature, and bin famous for their &s;everal works now extant: And that you may not think Learning to be a qualification that men are onely adorned with|all, you &s;hall find it &s;hine in the contrary &s;ex, for they can boa&s;t of one <HI>Aloy&s;ia Sigea,</HI> a famous female, <HI>Pallas Alcera,</HI> a &s;econd <HI>Minerva,</HI> who was excellently ver&s;'d in five &s;everal languages, and tho&s;e that are the radices of all others, as Latine, Greek, He|brew, Syriack, and Chaldaick:
<PB N="90" REF="51">and &s;ome of the epi&s;tles that <HI>Paul</HI> the third wrote to this <HI>Toledo</HI> vir|gin, are extent to this very day. That her confines extend incre|dible, wil appear by this, that there are but 360^d in the Zodiack, and <HI>Portugal</HI> her&s;elf is thought to take up 200. Now it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that her policy &amp; prudence in governing &s;o many &s;quandred kingdoms, &amp; &s;o great a number of inhabitants, of &s;everal humours, con&s;titutions and tempers, mu&s;t needs be great. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> may <HI>imperare,</HI> but the miracle is, how he makes them <HI>parere;</HI> 'tis not &s;o great a wonder that he governs them, as that he makes themobey, when as we all know that the vul|gar are very apt to be rebellious, and rai&s;e a mutiny in one &s;ingle countrey, and yet he makes mul|titudes of people, and tho&s;e of &s;e|veral
<PB N="91" REF="51">countreys, bow to his Scep|ter. And as &s;he is famous for her Government and Policy, &s;he is al&s;o eminent for the number of Princes that &s;he hath brought forth, &amp; be&s;tow'd upon other Na|ations, as well as tho&s;e that have &s;way'd the Spani&s;h Scepter; and fir&s;t &s;he produced <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> who fir&s;t founded the Spani&s;h Monarchy, by matching with <HI>Donna I&s;abella,</HI> queen of <HI>Ca|&s;tile,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> the II. who was tearm'd <HI>Philip the Prudent,</HI> by a Parlament in <HI>Spain,</HI> &amp; afterwards &s;olemnly confirm'd by a Con&s;i|&s;tory at <HI>Rome:</HI> Be&s;ides, &s;he hath brought forth Princes to other nations, as <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the I. &amp; the fir&s;t Emperor noted for Morality and Virtue, who rebuilt and rai|&s;ed up the tottering Roman Mo|narchy: And <HI>Trajan</HI> the Empe|ror,
<PB N="92" REF="52">who had as great a &s;hare of Piety, as <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had of Felici|ty; as al&s;o the Emperor <HI>Hadri|an,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Fir&s;t, who was an Infant of <HI>Spain;</HI> a Prince, who for all Virtues and Qualifi|cations &s;uitable to, and nece&s;&s;ary for one of his dignity, came &s;hort of none of his Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>To conclude, and draw to a period: The Spaniard is very much to be commended for his Policy, Prudence, and deliberate Con&s;ultations, for his Patience, Gravity, and admirable Choler; his noble, and liberal Di&s;po&s;ition; his Valor, Magnanimity, Con|&s;tancy, and height of Spirit: As for <HI>Spain</HI> her &s;elf, &s;he may be term'd <HI>The Exchequer of Chri|&s;tendom,</HI> and the Nur&s;e of &s;tout Champions, who exceeds in Men and Mines, and Arts as well as
<PB N="93" REF="52">Arms. Her Kings are the long|e&s;t arm'd Monarchs in the world, who have as many Kingdoms as &s;ome have Provinces; as many Fleets, as &s;ome have Ships; as many Viceroys, as &s;ome Mar|&s;hals; and as many Capitains by Sea and Land, as others have pri|vate Soldiers. Fortune her &s;elf may be call'd the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Wife, who hath brought with her &s;uch va&s;t Trea&s;ures for her Dow|ry. And thus having given you a ta&s;te of her Vices and Vertues, Power and Weakne&s;s, Perfection and Imperfection, I lay down my Quill, being come to my <HI>Ne ultra.</HI></P>
