<HEAD>A true Report of all the pa&s;&s;ages in the Ile of <HI>Ree,</HI> twixt the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> his Grace, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Thorax,</HI> Gouernour of the Fort, as al|&s;o betwixt the Duke, and the French King, and of the &s;tate of the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> and the Kings forces lying before it, to|gether with other matters of moment lately hapned there. As it was on Sun|day la&s;t being the 25. of <HI>October,</HI> rela|ted at <HI>White Hall,</HI> by a <HI>Dutchman</HI> that came from thence.</HEAD>
<P>_ABout twelue dayes &s;ince it plea&s;ed his Ex|cellencie the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> to di&s;patch a Dutchman with Letters to his Maie&s;tie concerning the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our Armie, lying now in the Ile of <HI>Ree,</HI> and before the Fort or Cittadell there, who &s;aith,
<PB REF="3">that about three dayes before his comming away, Sir <HI>William Bourchier</HI> arriued at the Ile with certaine &s;hips furni&s;hed with money and victuals, &s;afe and well, which gaue great comfort to his Excellencie, hauing long ex|pected to heare from <HI>England,</HI> in &s;o much that before his arriuall our Armie was in great di&s;tre&s;&s;e for want of pro|ui&s;ion and of victuals, and other nece&s;&s;aries, that it was a great que&s;tion whether they &s;hould continue there any longer, or rather giue ouer the further pro&s;ecution of the action, in regard of tho&s;e many extremities that they were brought vnto, hauing beene of a long time not &s;up|plyed from <HI>England,</HI> whereupon my Lord taking into con&s;ideration, the great di&s;honour that would redound to the Nation; &s;aid that he would for his part aduenture him&s;elfe to the vttermo&s;t perils Fortune could obiect a|gain&s;t him, rather then hee would giue ouer &s;o noble a de&s;igne, and did therevpon exhort all his followers and Souldiers to a con&s;tant per&s;euerance in the action, mau|gre all the difficulties that might en&s;ue &s;aying that hee would participate of the greate&s;t dangers with themene&s;t of his followers, before hee would &s;uffer the di&s;honour that would accrue vpon the declining of &s;uch an action, and further &s;aid hee would rather commit him&s;elfe and his whole Armie to the releeuing of the Towne of Ro|chell before he would returne into England with di&s;ho|nour, or without the accompli&s;hing of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e for which he came thither.</P>
<P>For the &s;tate of the Fort (notwith&s;tanding &s;ome &s;mall reliefe they lately had obtayned) is &s;uch that in the iudgement of man, it cannot hold out many dayes, for &s;ince they haue receiued &s;ome reliefe, there hath come forth daily by twenties more or le&s;&s;e, poore hunger-&s;tarued people, which doth demon&s;trate the &s;tate of the re&s;t, hauing had (as they report) only a
<PB REF="3">poore pittance of Bread and Water, for a moneth or fiue weekes together, in&s;omuch, that the number in the Fort which they haue remayning for defence, is come from two thou&s;and and odde to fiue hundred, and that of late about two dayes before the comming away of this Me&s;&s;enger, a Dutchman comming out of the Fort, and did deliuer to my Lord Duke the &s;trength of the Fort, and where they were be&s;t prouided for defence, what places were weake&s;t, and not able to defend the lea&s;t a&s;&s;ault, &s;hould bee made again&s;t them. For in rea&s;on, if we con&s;ider the compa&s;&s;e of the Fort) being about a mile) the be&s;ieged with that number of men cannot mayntaine each worke, with enterchange of fre&s;h men, as the nece&s;&s;itie of the &s;iege will require, by which you may gather that they cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Be&s;ides my Lord hath taken and doth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, two of the principall out-workes of the Enemie, by which they are able to di&s;mount the greate&s;t part of their Ordi|nance, and in &s;hort time to command &s;ome other of their be&s;t workes, and to giue law vnto them in their owne tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ches.</P>
<P>Vpon which con&s;ideration, together with other infor|mation receiued, my Lord called a Councell, and did thereupon re&s;olue to a&s;&s;aile them in places of be&s;t ad|uantage, which was to be put in execution immediate|ly vpon the comming away of this Me&s;&s;enger, not doub|ting (as this Me&s;&s;enger reports) of a happie I&s;&s;ue, and that the Fort before this is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>For the further hope of reliefe which they may ex|pect from the Mayne, my Lord hath taken &s;uch care, and hath from Rochell receiued diuers flat bottome
<PB REF="4">Boates, which are &s;o linked and chainted together by art, that now it is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;uccour &s;hould be brought in, in the night, as formerly hath beene; now, whereas &s;ome may obiect again&s;t my Lords care in &s;uf|fering the Fort thus at &s;euerall times to be relieued, I an|&s;wer, that it is not po&s;&s;ible, neither could the wit of man preuent the &s;ame, if they will venture at all times, and hazard them&s;elues, but that &s;ome of many may &s;cape in, with &s;ome &s;mall proui&s;ion, vnle&s;&s;e wee could guard the &s;hoare with a &s;ufficient number of Boates a&s;well night, as day, to preuent which they haue now made a Barracado; as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The French King did lately &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger to my Lord to require a faire quarter to bee ob&s;erued by his Excellency, &amp; did promi&s;e the like &s;hould be ob&s;erued on his part, wherunto my Lord &s;ent him this an&s;wer, that for his part he would ob&s;erue all farre quarters with his Maie&s;tie by land; but by water, he de&s;ired him to par|don him, and &s;ayd, that by water it might di&s;aduan|him, and therefore would keepe no other quarters then he had done hitherto, and which by the Law of Armes he might iu&s;tifie with his Honour.</P>
<P>The French King lying with his Armie before Rochell is verie &s;icke, and doth &s;uffer much in his Army by &s;euerall ca&s;ualties: the new Fort which hee hath lately erected, is much demoli&s;hed, and diuer&s;e workes belonging to it taken by the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">chellers, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Rochell are building another Fort again&s;t it, which will be a great annoyance to the Kings Armie.</P>
<P>The Duke of Rohan is marching to the ayd of Ro|chell with 7000. Foot and 500. Hor&s;e well prouided
<PB REF="4">and re&s;olute Souldiers. In Lorraine, a Bi&s;hop of that Dukedome hath in readine&s;&s;e 15000. men, which as it is &s;ayd, are prouided, and haue a purpo&s;e to fall vpon &s;ome parts of the French Kings Dominions, and that the quarrell &s;hould be the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria's, be&s;ides &s;ome other Princes are preparing to inuade him likewi&s;e, which will giue the French King his hands full.</P>
<P>My L. Duke and his whole Armie are couragious and in good e&s;tate, he hath receiued lately fiue compa|nies from Rochell of braue re&s;olute fellowes, and hath &s;ent into Rochell all his &s;icke and hurt men, where they are well releeued of all nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>The Rochellers haue wholly declared them&s;elues for the King of England, as by the Articles which are agreed vpon by my L. Duke and them doth appeare, his Excel|lencie hath &s;ent word to his Maie&s;tie, that if it plea&s;e him to &s;end him bread, he will de&s;erue it, but if he will adde vnto it &s;omewhat more he will drinke his health; by which you may &s;ee his inuincible courage, zeale and affection to his Countries Honour, which I pray God to pro&s;per.</P>
<P>Since this Me&s;&s;enger came, one Ma&s;ter <HI>Griffin,</HI> a Gentle-man belonging to his Excellencie, arriued in London on Sunday night (who being longer at &s;ea) yet was di&s;patcht away before this Dutch-man 12. daies, &amp; doth confirme what this Me&s;&s;enger brought, only it was his misfortune to arriue after him, being cro&s;t by con|trarie winds, and the Barke in which hee came in being ca&s;t away, and onely him&s;elfe and his fellow-pa&s;&s;engers were &s;aued by the mercie of God, together with tho&s;e packets and other matters of worth, which they had in
<PB REF="5">the &s;aid Barke, were &s;aued from &s;hipwracke, and can re|late not much more then the former Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
