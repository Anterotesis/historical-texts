<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONO|rable, George, Earle of Shrewe&s;|bury: Lord Talbot: Furniuall: Warden: and Strange, of Blackemyre: Knight of the mo&s;t Noble order of the Gartyre, and one of the Queenes maie&s;ties mo&s;t honourable priuie Councell, and Iu&s;tice in Eyre, from Trent North|wardes. IOHN IONES WISHETH ALL HEALTH, long lyfe, encrea&s;e of honour, and Graces eternall.</HEAD>
<P>_AFTER that the Philo&s;opher (right Noble Earle) had con&s;idered the mo&s;te woonderfull workes of God, and nature, &s;o orderlie placed within the Sphere or round world, Macroco&s;i|mus, with all things aboue the Elementes, and Quinte&s;&s;ence, the hyghe heauens, as the in|feriour con&s;tellations: Influences: and Begynners of corrupti|ble &s;ub&s;tances: the Elements them &s;elues: all thinges, in the Fyre, Ayre, vvater, and Earth: be it be&s;yde of the highe&s;t immor+tall, and perpetuall, or of the inferiours: mortall and corrupti|ble, doing, being, growing, &s;enting, and rea&s;onable, as Microco|&s;ums, man, for other v&s;es &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, the heauenly bodies, con|&s;pyred to one ab&s;olute Empyre, vvith all thinges vnder them, produced, to mo&s;t effectual purpo&s;es, cau&s;ing him to &s;ay, God, and nature, dyd nothing in vaine.</P>
<P>The which heauenly &s;aying, dayly we fynde mo&s;t true, albeit, many of tho&s;e greate and hidden benefytes: preordinate by prouidence diuine: were vnknowen many yeares, to many na|cyons. In&s;omuch, as hu&s;bandry an arte mo&s;t comune: and now of lea&s;t conning: was long vnknowen: men liuing on the fruits
<PB REF="3">of the Erth, without any manura~ce, as bea&s;ts: for vntil Dioni&s;ius his time, it was vnknowen amo~g&s;t the Egipcia~s, &amp; vntil Charles the fith Monarche, among&s;t the India~s: as Diodorus, Polydorus and Martine Curte&s;&s;e affirmeth: and in Greece and A&s;ia, vntill Triptolemus: In Italie, vntill Saturnus: as Macrobius shew|eth. So was, vvyne, Oyle, Honie, Ale, Beere, Bread, Chee&s;e, and infinite other thinges, after orderlie appointed, to our v&s;es as doth appeare And, Bacchus vvas the fyr&s;t, that of Barly made Ale, for the Egipcyans: bicau&s;e as then they had no Grapes: the which we Britaines v&s;e &s;till, and they of Germanie, and Flan+dres, beere. The Iewes found oyle, as Iu&s;tinus writeth, and Gor|gonius the king, hony: Ari&s;teus the making of chee&s;e: Arachue Flax, and knitting, as Plinius approueth: Minerua, &s;pinning: Nicias, fulling: Pallas clothing: V&s;o, apparel &s;ayeth Eu&s;ebius, Building of hou&s;es is a&s;cribed fir&s;t to lobal, if we beleue Poli|dore: walles and towers, &s;ayth Ari&s;totle the Cyclopians edified: Carpentry, Dedalus inuented: &s;ayling, Neptunus: gold Cadmus found out, fir&s;t in Thrace, and Emanuel the la&s;t king of Portu|gall, &s;ent to &s;eeke it fir&s;t in India: Siluer, Erictonius: Iron, Ideda|ctili: Lead, Mydachuitus: Bra&s;&s;e, Ari&s;totle &s;ayth, Lydius: Fyre, Vulcanus: Phi&s;ick, Apollo: amplified by AE&s;culapius: perfec|ted by Hippocrates: expounded by Galen. Bathes and hot hou+&s;es, Nero, Agrippa, Ve&s;pa&s;ianus, Titus, and other Emperours, Kings, Philo&s;ophers and Phi&s;itions, as te&s;tifieth Iulius Capito|linus.</P>
<P>So that by the&s;e and ten thou&s;and others, we may gather, that Gods good gyfts haue not all at one time bin reuealed, nor at one in&s;tant to al nacions auayled, but &s;ome by one, in one time, &s;ome by another in another time, and all as it plea&s;ed his infinit bountie, to ayde and benefite his creatures with: as by king Bla|dud the Britten were fir&s;t erected the bathes of Bath: So now we may &s;ay by your honour, the bathes of Buck&s;tone to be be|neficially edified, worthy euery where to be notified.</P>
<P>Of the which, by Gods help, and your honours protection,
<PB REF="3">&s;omewhat shalbe shewed hitherto vnknowen, that the benefite thereof, may the better be perceaued.</P>
<P>The which worke, how&s;oeuer it be, I be&s;eech your Noblenes to accept, as that which of mo&s;t right, to you of duety belongeth. And, fora&s;much as your care hath ben therein, to the benefyte of all: It is right that of all, you should be highlie magnified, for your vertuou&s;e exployte, accomplishing of &s;o noble a be|nefyte, and that in this our age, when as the mo&s;t &s;ort, are giuen to &s;eeke worldlie gayne, rather then the publique proffet (the more pittie it is to &s;peake it) and that &s;uch, as to them&s;elues, and theyrs, onelie, might belong. But your vertuou&s;e indu&s;try, is, &amp; hath ben, for the benefyt, of the vniuer&s;all people of God: as a thing, de&s;cending from your parents: and of you enherited. Therfore, to you mightie Erle I dedicate, the&s;e my labours, and playne Treati&s;e, entytuled <HI>Buckstones Benefyte,</HI> bicau&s;e, by you is accomplyshed, and notified, euery wher, that which was in a maner hydden, and vnknowen, to all a far of, and vnto the mo&s;t neere hand. If, I should here shew, how greatlie they are to bee extolled: that take &s;uch paine, and be at &s;uch co&s;t: for the wele publique: I might rather make a newe volume: then fynish this. As it may ea&s;ilie appeare, by that which is already expre&s;|&s;ed. VVherfore, I will &s;tay my pen, for that, I confe&s;&s;e my &s;elfe farre vnable: to &s;et out the condigne pray&s;es: that eyther too your honour belonge, for the true loue a&s;&s;urid Loyaltie, and great tru&s;t: vnto your pui&s;&s;ance comitted: or the worthy benefytes: that the Bathes, or vvels, of Buck&s;ton do yelde.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, great Alexander, retained with him in great fauour: one that wrote his hy&s;tory: albeit, it was not mo&s;t ele|gantlie penned (as Quintus Curtius affirmeth) bicau&s;e, it might encourage, &s;ome of more eloquence, to take in hand, the like enterpry&s;e: for, otherwi&s;e what had auayled the fame of hys conque&s;t? when that age had expired, if none had taken in hand: for the po&s;terities to haue remembred: who&s;e example herein I haue folowed.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>For that, &s;o great a benefyte, as is Buck&s;tons Bathes, vvithin the edifices vnder a bushel should not be ouerwhelmed: not, with out the order heerein expre&s;&s;ed how to v&s;e them: frequented. Vntill &s;ome other of more learning will better handle hit. Cra|uing nothing els for my paynes but that it may of your Lord|ship bee vvel excepted praying for the long pre&s;eruacion and encrea&s;e of your honour, in all helth, welth, and felicitie.

<P>_EVen as in one hou&s;ehould or familie (gentle Reader) the Chyldren, begotten betwene one Father and one Mother: doe differ one from another, a&s;well, in proporcion of body, as in wyt, di&s;po&s;ition; and maners: Euen &s;o, men of one facultie, in &s;undry things, be of &s;un+dry inuencions, iudgementes, and di&s;po|&s;icions: a&s;well Diuines, Lawiers, Phi|lo&s;ophers, as Phi&s;icio~s, no maruail ther+fore, if others. So hard it is for any man, be it neuer &s;o fre~dly inte~ded: neuer &s;o &s;tu|diou&s;ly laboured: neuer &s;o profitable, for, the wele publike: to &s;et forth any thing, for al mens liking, that euen mo&s;t of the wi&s;e&s;t &s;ort (as many men think) &s;et forth nothing by printing: bicau&s;e, many now a daies are giue~, to the &s;earching out ra|ther, (if they ca~) to blot him, with the le&s;t matter (if there bee no greater) and let the common profyt, then too &s;eeke the thinge that may all men benefyte, ey|ther
<PB REF="6">the &s;ame to commend, or therto too adde any credite.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch lyke cau&s;es, haue letted many (as I deme) fro~ the attempting of this (how&s;oeuer it be) which I haue ac|compli&s;hed, of Buck&s;tons benifite: aduen+turing rather for my part, to be &s;tong of the Drones, then to leaue the good hony vn&s;ought and to be barked at, with &s;uch vnkind curs, then to leaue the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e helples: tru&s;ting that the wi&s;e, Graue, Learned, Curteou&s;e, &amp; Louing &s;ort, wil accept the endeuour of him, who a&s;much as in him lieth (for y^e tyme) doth &s;eeke, how he may be&s;t profit the vniuer|&s;all people of God, and in &s;peciall, hys owne countrymen that bee vexed with &s;uch greuous &s;ickne&s;&s;es, as they de&s;paire of remedy, by any other meanes.</P>
<P>Galen, whe~ he came fir&s;t to Rome, &s;ent for by Marcus Aurel. Willing his Lief|tenant, that he &s;huld honorably furni&s;he him with men, money, hor&s;e, &amp; municion as very noblie he did: for that he was de|&s;irous greatly of his con&s;ayle. Commo|dus his &s;onne being very &s;icke of a feuer,
<PB REF="6">the which at the fir&s;t &s;ight, hee pre&s;aged (for that the Cri&s;is &s;o progno&s;ticated, a knowledge by him throughly labored, as he that was mo&s;t expert in phi&s;icke) that he &s;hould haue his fit no more: whereat, the Phi&s;icions of the Emperours hyghe councell, meruayled, &amp; whe~ they &s;aw the effect, greatly di&s;dayned (for &s;uch know|ledge they had not &s;tudied) where they &s;hould haue louingly embraced him, and highly haue co~mended him, for Tagalti+us &s;aieth, the maners that to Phi&s;icions belonged, are that thei be of gentle enter+taynement, curteou&s;e, &amp; friendly toward &s;uch as be of their own profe&s;&s;io~, in greek termed Philateiras. But what did hee? leaue his well dooing for all their enuy|ing? no truly. So much was hee gyuen the vniuer&s;all world to profyt, more ear|ne&s;tly proceeded forward in all good doc|trine, as by his workes made there, both again&s;t Era&s;i&s;tratus, co~cerning letting of blood: and again&s;t The&s;&s;alus Trali|anus, about the healing of vlcers, maye appeare: prouing &amp; reprouinge, by mo&s;t waighty arguments, &amp; be&s;t authorities,
<PB REF="7">al that he did not waying the di&s;dain of a fewe, &s;o that he might profyt all, as no dout he hath al the world. Let Paracel|&s;us (&amp; all other vayn practi&s;ers do what they can) with his fyre work, of three be|ginnings, of &s;alt, Brim&s;tone, and quick|&s;iluer, blowing the coles vnto a&s;hes, and &s;tilling til they haue no gla&s;&s;es, as wy&s;e as gee&s;e, as rea&s;onable as apes, as trim as Colyers, and as riche as newe &s;horne &s;heepe.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing Galen, in who~ was heaped as in a grainard: all knowledge both philo&s;ophicall, &amp; phi&s;icall, was enuyed, di&s;dained, backbyted, and yet of &s;ome is: what &s;hal I think to go &s;cotfre, that am &s;o far inferiour vnto him, as is the &s;chol|ler, vnto the mai&s;ter? No no, therefore I will arme my head with patience: and my harte with a cleare Con&s;cience, pro|te&s;ting before GOD: and men, (which thorow the enuiou&s;nes of the time I am driue~ vnto) that this, that I haue done, I haue done neyther of a proud mynd, ambicious de&s;ire, or ouerwening in my &s;elfe, but of a very feruent zeale, to the
<PB REF="7">pre&s;eruation of health, and mayntay|ning of lyfe: bycau&s;e I &s;awe &s;o many repaire thither, without al order. By meanes whereof, &s;ome went away very &s;ick, that came thither indyfferent well. Some neuer a whit the better: whiche if they had had good coun&s;ail, might. And &s;ome, more by hap then by cunning: as it dyd them no good, &s;o dyd it them no harme.</P>
<P>The&s;e things wayed, I began to con|&s;ider with my &s;elf, of many things dout|ting, whether it were better, to let pa&s;&s;e, as other wi&s;er, &amp; better lerned the~ I had done &s;uch matters, or to procede therein. The which, whe~ I had atte~pted, more and more I &s;aw was too bee &s;ayde, min|ding to haue gone no further: thus be|twene dout and de&s;pair, hapned to come vnto me, of the lerned &s;ome, &amp; other of the gentility, wi&s;e &amp; expert that feared God, loued their country: and hearing that I had begon &s;uche a matter of Buck&s;tone, as I had of Bath: in&s;ta~tly de&s;ired mee, to goe forward, affirming, I &s;hould doo a gratefull deed too the common weale
<PB REF="8">of my natiue cou~try, &amp; that for the north parts, &amp; We&s;t: a&s;wel as the South: yea &amp; if it were not &s;o well done as &s;ome others of more wi&s;edome, learning, &amp; experience could, (as I think of my &s;elf it is not) yet bicau&s;e it &s;hould encourage &s;ome other, if they &s;aw myne not &s;ufficient to amende (as it is ea&s;ier then to begin) that which I haue rudely rouded ouer. Albeit al that which I haue done, is collected out of the be&s;t writers in phi&s;ick: and for the&s;e .xiiii. yeres &amp; more, proued. Tru&s;ting it will be wel accepted, &s;eeing the profit is thyne, &amp; the labor myne. But if ther be any &s;o af|fectionated to Rhetorique, that vnle&s;&s;e they find a moulhil made a mountayne, or an Emet, an Elepha~t, think the mat|ter vnperfect let them con&s;ider that.</P>
<P><HI>Non cupit ornari, cupit, &amp;c.</HI> Or if, they &s;uppo&s;e knowledge nothinge worthe, vttered in their own language. The~ I mu&s;t nedes &s;ay, they &s;hall find this of Buck&s;tons be|nefyt, &amp; al&s;o Bathes aide vnperfect. How+beit, of this if they con&s;ider, they may ea|&s;ily fynde whether a thing briefely and plainly taught, bee better, or a thing ob|&s;cure
<PB REF="8">&amp; intricate: and whether a thinge familiar, or a thing &s;traunge be ea&s;ie&s;t to iudge of, what neede many wordes? If a longe di&s;cour&s;e had more needed, then a &s;hort: Hippocrates had not written his Aphori&s;ines, nor Galen Ars parua: ney|ther had they writen in Greeke, when as all Grece vnder&s;toode Greeke, a&s;well as they, or we in England engli&s;h. But had deui&s;ed &s;ome new tongue: a matter of no great labour: for the Drawcabio~ tongue of fiue yeares &s;tanding, as it was in a day inuented. So was it in a weeke per|fected: &amp; is with &s;ome, for their plea&s;ures in daily v&s;e. But the&s;e toies, were far fro~ their meaning, &amp; &s;o I dout not, but they be now from the wy&s;e, or els, the guide of the &s;oule, Gods woord, had not bin in our owne tongue vttered, nor of Paule, &s;o ap|pointed. And therfore, if with the matter any be offended, let the~ be offended with the be&s;t learned, who&s;e example herein I haue followed, and out of whom this is collected. If the phra&s;e like them not, I wi&s;he them to thinke, &s;o many men, &s;o many wittes: &s;o many &s;tyles, &s;o many
<PB REF="9">deui&s;es, as you haue hard. If the &s;tyle be to playne, I would haue them to reme~|ber, whether heuy things be ea&s;ier of di&s;|ge&s;tion, or light: and briefly to conclude, whether their own familiar &s;pech: their own lawes: or the Romains be better, &amp; ea&s;yer, too Iudge of. Too conclude, if the matter be be&s;t whiche the approued writers, ob&s;erue &amp; affirme: then I dare &s;ay, this is not all ill. If the phra&s;e be be&s;t that is mo&s;t playn, the~ this is not wor&s;t. If the &s;tyle or endyting be be&s;t which co~|tinueth the matter: then this is not vt|terly to bee di&s;allowed. In fyne, if the mother tongue be mo&s;t meete for hir own children, and ea&s;ye&s;t to be vnder&s;tanded, then this in our own, you will affirme, is not to bee abandoned. So that I wil thus ende.</P>

This is a&s;much, as I &s;uppo&s;e, may b&eacute;e gathered thereof, that it hath the name of the Towne: and the Towne lykewy&s;e hath the name of &s;ome one &s;o cal|led (for of &s;uch there b&eacute;e diuers) and the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> a&s;well as the <HI>Britaynes</HI> were wont to name their townes after their own names, as it is euide~t of very many places in this lande: and a Saxon, or Engli&s;h name it is, and no Britti&s;h, or Wel&s;h: And therefore, &s;ithence <HI>Engi&s;tus,</HI> it hath his denomination. Howbeit, many yeares pa&s;t, it was fre|quented for the health of thou&s;andes, by bathing them: a&s;|well as it is in the&s;e our dayes. For, betw&eacute;ene Burghe and it, there is an high way forced ouer the moores, all paued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buck&s;tones Bathes of great anti|quitie.</NOTE> of &s;uch antiquity as none can expre&s;&s;e, called Bathgate: alb&eacute;e it more of a &s;uper&s;titiou&s;e hope they had in thywell, than of
<PB REF="10">
<Q REND="inline">any affiance thei had in the qualitie, te~perature, or property of the Bath: for of it and the v&s;e therof, they were ignorant.</Q></P>
<P>Moreouer, It is not vnlikely that the &s;tagges or buckes wounded, would take &s;oyle ther, and there the fo&s;ters of the forre&s;t, called it Buck&s;tand: but in my iudgement, the for|mer &s;uppo&s;ition is more likely. And as for Cottrels tale, or the vayne inuencions about S. Aune found in the well, or of the water fet from flood Iordan. I recke~ not them worthy the recitall. Therefore, I will not detayne you with &s;uche tryfles, our dayes being &s;o &s;hort: and the rea&s;on of the arte, &s;o hard to attayne, (as <HI>Hypocrates, 1. lib. Aph. primo</HI> &s;ayeth) pa&s;&s;ing ouer, the di&s;tinction of bathes here in this Treati&s;e, and definition of artificiall: bicau&s;e in my fir&s;t booke of the Bathes of Bathe, they be &s;hewed, contenting vs with the naturall.</P>
<P>Naturall bathes be tho&s;e, which flow throw the entralles of the earth: taking their effect of &s;uch things, as they runne thorow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Significatio~ of Bathes.</NOTE> and receyue power by: for many infirmities mo&s;te auaylable. The differences of which ho&s;e naturall Bathes of Buck&s;tone, by what meanes, of what mynerals, for what gr&eacute;efes, infirmities, and &s;icknes they &s;erue be&s;t, &s;hal be pro|&s;ecuted with all po&s;&s;ible breuity, as far foorth as herein my iudgement is nece&s;&s;ary: &s;&eacute;eing that in our &s;econde Booke of Bathes ayde, you may find &s;uch things &s;ufficiently &s;ka~ned: and therefore vnn&eacute;edfull here of repeticion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of the ch&eacute;efe Bathe which is the warmer &s;pringe, voyde in effect of all corrupcion, arguing therfore, no great quantitie of brim&s;tone (as in Bathe) nor of allume, as &s;ome haue bruted. For then it &s;hould not onely b&eacute;e of another col|lour, marly yellow, or &s;warty gr&eacute;ene: but al&s;o it might &s;en|&s;ibly be perceyued by ta&s;te: albeit I acknowledge that <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> affirmeth, that there is no &s;uch ho&s;e &s;pring, without y^e myne of brym&s;ton And I think with <HI>Fal.</HI> &amp; <HI>Sauona. Rubr. de therm.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Falopius li. de So&s;&s;.</NOTE> none without firie heat: although the quantitie may
<PB N="2" REF="10">differ: and that may wel appeare. For if the quantitie were equal and like to the mynerals in Bath, the heat of as great force, fortified with like <HI>Antipari&s;ta&s;is,</HI> and as n&eacute;ere to the head, then it &s;hould little in that re&s;pect, vary from Bathe. But it &s;&eacute;emeth &amp; &s;ure it is &s;o, that Buck&s;tons bathes haue not the fourth part of that heate which the bathes of Bathe haue, nor the other mynerals that b&eacute;e ther. For Buck&s;tons is much like as if a quart of boyling water were commixed with a galond of cold water. But Bath is, as if too a galond of &s;&eacute;ething water were put a quart of cold water. By rea&s;on wherof, it attrecteth and di&s;&s;olueth more &s;p&eacute;edly. But buck|&s;tone more &s;w&eacute;etly, more delicatly, more finely, more daint|ly, and more temperatly: not bringing halfe &s;o many gr&eacute;e|uou&s;e accidentes as Bath doth, yit le&s;&s;e &s;p&eacute;edly: but in pro|ce&s;&s;e of tyme, very effectuou&s;ely, and for many infirmities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No greuous accident fo|lowing Buc|&s;tones Baths</NOTE> more commodiou&s;ly, re&s;trayninge vnnaturall i&s;&s;ues, and &s;trengthning the f&eacute;eble members: a&s;&s;i&s;ting the animall, vi|tall, and naturall faculties: di&s;per&s;ing opilacions, and qua|lifying gr&eacute;efes.</P>
<P>The well &s;pringes be &s;ituate in a valley, hard by a run|ning brooke, and runneth into it. Where at the m&eacute;eting you may &s;en&s;ibly percegue and f&eacute;ele the hot water on the one &s;yde of the riuer, and the colde on the other. Notwith&s;tan|ding, &s;o commixed after, that it letteth the riuer of fre&s;&s;hing, in the colde&s;t weather, for the &s;pace of a quarter of a myle, an argument of the power of the heate of tho&s;e &s;pringes which be thr&eacute;e e&s;peciall, and tho&s;e very excellent, and benefi|ciall for diuers di&s;temperatures, gr&eacute;efes and &s;ickne&s;&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">iij cheefe Bathes at Buck&s;tone</NOTE> as hereafter &s;halbe further &s;hewed, God a&s;&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>But there be fiue or fixe other, although not &s;o good: yet it maye b&eacute;e pre&s;uppo&s;ed, that if there were boryers, &s;uche as mynerall men v&s;e in &s;earching ore: too meete with the Springes, of &s;omme of the other, that the colde water, which is commixed wyth the hote, myght b&eacute;e turned away:

<PB REF="18">
<P>In the beginninges of &s;icknes, we do giue an euen dyet, which doth neyther augment, nor demini&s;h the &s;trength of the body. For fir&s;t we mu&s;t deale plenteou&s;ly (as <HI>Galen</HI> wil|leth <HI>primo ad Glanconem</HI>) that the &s;icke may &s;uffyce.</P>
<P>In declination we do encrea&s;e, for it behoueth too make encrea&s;e, lyke to the demini&s;hing, which was afore in &s;tate. Therfore <HI>Galen</HI> doth teach <HI>Tercio artis paruae,</HI> that the arte which doth refre&s;h, and &s;trengthen, is conuenyent for them that be whole.</P>

<P>The &s;hewing of the manner of v&s;e, is al&s;o taken of iiif. thinges afore &s;aid. For if the &s;trength &s;halbe weake, and the di&s;po&s;ition be of corruption of humours, or of want of them, w&eacute;e &s;hall giue the &s;icke but a little nouri&s;hment, a little in deede: bycau&s;e his weakene&s;&s;e, cannot &s;u&s;taine at once, the whole multitude of nouri&s;hment. And often bicau&s;e the di&s;|po&s;ition n&eacute;edeth many thinges: if &s;o be that, wanting dooth n&eacute;ede adding, and corruption clen&s;ing.</P>
<P>If with weakenes of the vertues or &s;trength, there &s;hal|b&eacute;e neyther any wanting, nor any corruption, neyther yet lacke of naturall humoures, but that they &s;hal abound, then we will giue fewe thinges, and &s;eldome, and &s;o much the rather, if the humours &s;hall abound.</P>
<P>But if ther &s;halbe want of humoures, or corruption, and the vertues &s;trong, then we wil giue much meate, and of|ten, as the di&s;po&s;ition may requyre, and nature &s;trong able to di&s;ge&s;t it.</P>
<P>If the vertues, powers, or &s;trength &s;halbe &s;trong, with a di&s;po&s;ition of the pleuri&s;y, then we wil giue &s;eldome, and litle at once, bycau&s;e the pre&s;erued &s;tate dooth not neede
<PB N="8" REF="18">much.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in Somer tyme, often &s;ew things mu&s;t be giuen: for that then the body n&eacute;edeth much adding, as tho&s;e which be di&s;&s;olued, through vapoures (as you haue hard) and haue but a weake &s;trength.</P>
<P>In the winter &s;ea&s;on, much may be giuen, by rea&s;on the actions be &s;tronger, yet &s;eldome, bycau&s;e the &s;icke doth not n&eacute;ede very much, adding as they to whom, there is not much euacuation made.</P>
<P>In the Spring, w&eacute;e will nouri&s;h with fewe things, and that a long tyme: as al&s;o in full di&s;po&s;itions, if the powers b&eacute;e &s;tronge.</P>

<P>_AS thou ha&s;t, mo&s;t mercyfull Father, of thine infinite bounty and grace, ge|uen vs power, to come, to the&s;e thy Bathes, (preordinate, of thy deuine prouidence) for the benefite of vs thy deare creatures: So likewi&s;e rightly we confes, that the breach of thy mo&s;t holly lawes, which we haue, to often done, is the very cau&s;e, that we be &s;o vexed, greued, di&s;ea&s;ed, and enf&eacute;ebled, as a iu&s;t cro&s;&s;e, for our mi&s;d&eacute;edes, &s;&eacute;eing that to the third, and fourth generation, thou ha&s;t &s;aid, thou wilt the~ vi&s;ite. Howbeit, we hope in thy mercies, vnto the which, as vnto a &s;afe anchor (to&s;&s;ed in this mi&s;erable maze of world+ly wretchednes) we certainly tru&s;t. Taking comfort of thy heauenly word, that whom thou cha&s;ti&s;e&s;t, thou loue&s;t. So loue vs good Lord, that we vnfaynedly tru&s;ting in thy woord, the &s;econd per&s;on in Trinitie our Red&eacute;emer, and calling on th&eacute;e in his name, (in one vnitie) may be rel&eacute;eued, comforted, &amp; ea&s;ed, as thou in thy word ha&s;t promi&s;ed (if it be thy mo&s;t gracious will) of all our gr&eacute;efes, whether they be inward or outward in body or mind. By the benefite wherof, all the <HI>Athi&s;tes</HI> godles and careles of the world, may knowe thy power: that from th&eacute;e, commeth health, to al Nations, for from th&eacute;e commeth al knowledge, how to v&s;e thy Creatures for our v&s;es be&s;t.</P>
<P>Graunt therfore good Lord, the healthfull &s;pirit of truth, the holy gho&s;te, to help, ayde, and a&s;&s;i&s;t vs, in all our afflyc|tions, and to guyde thy mini&s;ters, natures Interpreters, Phi&s;itions, with thy heauenly health, that being &s;trengthe|ned by thy influence, may not only, the better benefite vs, and the certeyner, a&s;&s;ertaine vs, of thy gyftes, here and els

This graunt eternall Father thorough the bloud, of the immaculate Lamb, Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, that we departing hence, better in health, &amp; &s;trength, therby may glorify th&eacute;e, ouer all the worlde the more, too whome with the Sonne, and the holy gho&s;t, be all glory, pray&s;e, do|minion, and power, for euer and euer Amen.</P>
