<HEAD>The Objections of the Le|vant Company an|&s;wered.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="objection">
<Q><HI>Object.</HI> 1. _THat their Impri&s;onment of Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> and their &s;ei|&s;ure of his E&s;tate, was in their own defence; for impri&s;oning their Factors, and &s;ei&s;ure of all their E&s;tates: for that (otherwi&s;e) he would have devoured them.</Q>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> (by his Commi&s;&s;ion, the Grand Seignors Capitulations, the Cu&s;tom of that Emba&s;&s;ie, and by his Articles with that Company) was the authori&s;ed Governor and Judge in all Cau&s;es, there, belonging to this nation; and thereby might ju&s;tifie the impri&s;onment of any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man under the Charge, or the Seque&s;tration of any of theirs, or their Factors E&s;tates, on a lawfull occa&s;ion; and &s;ays, that the Companies re&s;i&s;tance, in &s;uch ca&s;e, was not only un|lawfull, but de&s;tructive to Government it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. That, though he had a ju&s;t occa&s;ion, yet he denies, that he did ever impri&s;on their Factors, or &s;eque&s;ter their E&s;tates, but &s;ays, that by a particular Covenant with the Company (a|mong&s;t other things) he being obliged to cau&s;e all their pub|lique
<PB N="2" REF="5">orders to be ob&s;erved, (and one of them being, that (when any debt &s;hould ari&s;e in <HI>Turkie,</HI> payable by the Compa|ny) he &s;hould cau&s;e the &s;ame to be levyed by an equal Average, on all the Engli&s;h E&s;tates in the place.) In <HI>Anno</HI> 1645. the Companies Debts being ca&s;t up by their Officers there, and a Leviation agreed on to be made by their Factors, for the payment of that debt, (According to the Companies publique Or|ders and Cu&s;toms in that behalf) &s;ome particular Members of that Company, contrary to their Publique Rules, gave Order to their re&s;pective Factors, not to pay their parts thereof, ex|cept by force.</P>
<P N="3">3. Which comming to the Creditors eares (being mo&s;t of the Grand Seignors Subjects) they &s;oon repaired to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ju&s;tice, and upon Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> promi&s;e at the Nations intreaty (after the Leviation agreed) to &s;ee them &s;atisfied, the Creditors would have made him re&s;pon&s;ible for the others Debts.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Whereupon</HI> the Bu&s;ine&s;s comming before the publique <HI>Divann,</HI> the <HI>Vizier</HI> &s;ent forth his Officers to demand the Debt of the Nation, impri&s;oned the Per&s;ons, and &s;eque&s;tred the E&s;tates of &s;uch as refu&s;ed to pay their parts, (which was but Ju&s;tice in him on the Factors defaults.)</P>
<P N="5">5. And whereas in &s;uch Ca&s;e, the <HI>Vizier</HI> might have &s;ent them to the Common Gaol (in favour to Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> on their behalf) he &s;ent them only to his Hou&s;e, untill they &s;hould cau&s;e the moneys owing by them to be paid.</P>
<P N="6">6 Where they were &s;o far from being kept as Pri&s;oners, that they had a plentifull Table kept for them, all the while apart, at Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> his charge, and (upon his Paroll to the <HI>Vizier</HI>) had liberty all the day time to go about their own Occa&s;i|ons.</P>
<P N="7">7. But during the time of their &s;tay there (which was near a month) tho&s;e refractory Factors were &s;o far from paying their Debts, that (pretending Orders from their Principals to the contrary) they joined together, and (by a greater Levi|ation than before, made on the Trade and Nation) they bribed the <HI>Turks,</HI> procured Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> to be &s;upended from the duties of his Charge, and (before any intimation given to, and without any Authority from this State) by their own Election procured a
<PB N="3" REF="5" MS="y">Common factor of the place, to be made their Agent, in Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> his &s;teed; and by force of Money &s;o continued him &s;u&s;pen&s;ed, &s;eazed his e&s;tate, &s;eque&s;tred his profits, and pro&s;ecuted him at the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Law, for 15. months together, before Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h</HI> his arrival.</P>
<P N="8">8. During which time, he was &s;o bound up by their Agents bribes, and the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> power, that he had no means to offend the Company; and from the beginning of his Emba&s;&s;ie, till that time, it will appear by their own letters (be&s;ides many a thanks from them, for his care of their Affaires) that they had no que|&s;tion with him, but about the Strangers Con&s;ulage (a valuable perqui&s;ite of that Emba&s;&s;ie worth 4. or 5000 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> which the Company would fain have had from him) and was really the Original, if not the only ground of all di&s;putes, be|tween them, as them&s;elves in &s;ome of their own Letters Con|fe&s;&s;e.</P>
<P N="9">9. Which if made good (as Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> is punctually able to prove) there was certainly &s;o little ground or cau&s;e for a defence on the Companies part, that the offence will appear to be wholly on their &s;ides, and that Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> was only the Defendant, <HI>Ab origine,</HI> as he hath been all along (and as at this day he is.)</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="objection">
<Q><HI>Object.</HI> That by orders under Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> his hand, and otherwi&s;e, they have proved, the fir&s;t offence to have been given by him; and that his witne&s;&s;es have been al&s;o heard.</Q>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. Upon this bare pretence, Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> hath been pro&s;ecuted by the Company the&s;e ten years pa&s;t, and more, and what ever they may pretend, they have not in all this time produced one witne&s;s, but parties to their Complaint.</P>
<P N="1">1. And though the&s;e witne&s;&s;es (under a like pretence that the bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e may perhaps prove criminal in the i&s;&s;ue) be admitted <HI>de bene e&s;&s;e</HI> only by the Committeee (to whom the Cau&s;e is now referred for examination) yet on the other &s;ide Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> hath not to this day examined one witne&s;&s;e through on his part; &s;o, no judgement can be given, nor report yet be made by the Com|mittee, wherefore to judge him before a full examination, were to conclude him <HI>ex parte.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="6" MS="y">
<P N="2">2 And la&s;tly for An&s;wer to tho&s;e warrants, which the Compa|ny &s;ay they have produced under his own hand (and he denies not to bee his) he doubts not, by &s;ome Clau&s;es and re&s;erves in tho&s;e very warrants, and In&s;tructions (without other help) to free him&s;elf from this objection, or any Act of force on his part ef|fected (or &s;o much as intended) by him again&s;t the Company or any of theirs, the&s;e orders being prepared only and lodged in his Servants hands, in order to his own defence, and by way of prevention only, of that force which hee was advertized, the Company intended again&s;t him, and their factors &s;oon after di&s;covered, And put upon him; (&s;ome time before tho&s;e war|rants came to light) by means whereof never any thing was put in execution, nor ought Acted by his Servants, or by vertue of his &s;aid directions, upon the Factors or any of their e|&s;tates.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="objection">
<Q><HI>Object.</HI> 3. That Sir <HI>Sackvile</HI> &s;ues the Company for that, which the Par|liament warranted and avowed them in, and they Acted but as Servants to the Parliament.</Q>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. The Parliaments Commitment of Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> (upon their bare and &s;ole Complaint) after his arrival in <HI>England,</HI> will hardly amount to a ju&s;tification of what they did to him in <HI>Turky;</HI> unles they make good that complaint on which he was committed by the Parliament after his arrival here.</P>
<P N="2">2. But if the Company can produce any other warrant or avow|ment from the Parliament, for their cau&s;ing him to be &s;u&s;pen|ded (as before recited) either before Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;hes</HI> arival at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> or for the impri&s;onment of his per&s;on, and their &s;eizure of his e&s;tate there, (after Sir <HI>Tho. Bendi&s;hes</HI> coming) or plunder of his hou&s;e &amp;c. (which hereafter will come to be re|lated) he offers readily (and without regret) to withdraw his &s;ute at the Law, where his action for the pre&s;ent is, for their fal&s;e Impri&s;onment there and by the way only, and his Dama|ges.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="objection">
<Q><HI>Object.</HI> 4. That under the Notion of the Act of Oblivion, he pretends Indempnity for all his offences, Criminal, and under that
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y">protection, granted him by the Committee, he &s;hrowds him&s;elf from their particular Actions, whil&s;t he &s;ues them at the Law, for tho&s;e things whereof he pretends indem|nification.</Q>
<P><HI>An&s;w</HI> 4. Though he hath not hitherto pleaded that Act (nor in this Cau&s;e conceives he &s;hall have any occa&s;ion) yet he hath no rea&s;on to lay by any part of his Armour again&s;t &s;o implacable and powerful an Enemy; knows not why his pleading that Act &s;hould barr him from pro&s;ecuting any of his particular Debts, Nor in the mean time can his a&s;&s;uming of that privi|lege from the Committee be any barr to any of them, or any of their private Actions again&s;t him: Neither doth he (nor &s;hall he ever) make any other u&s;e of that protection from the Com|mittee, than intended by it, for his &s;ecurity, in order to his de|fence, during the dependence of the cau&s;e before them; And when ever the Company &s;hall de&s;i&s;t there or withdraw their Complaint in Parliament, he &s;hall not refu&s;e to appear to any Action of theirs at law; And till then, holds it not rea&s;onable to be lyable to an&s;wer the &s;ame things in two Courts of Ju&s;tice at once.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="objection">
<Q><HI>Object.</HI> 5. That he was an Enemy to the Parliament, and divers of their Welwi&s;hers, particularly marked out by him for ru|ine.</Q>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 5. Though Companies (E&s;pecially this) are confident e|nough, and becau&s;e they cannot blu&s;h, may &s;ay what they plea&s;e, yet the&s;e have not hitherto taken the liberty to a&s;&s;ert any &s;uch thing again&s;t Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> in any of their publike Com|plaints, or Petitions to the Parliament, but by private whi&s;|pers and in&s;inuations: Nor have they otherwi&s;e proved any thing, tending to that end, but by &s;urmi&s;e, and without know|ing hitherto, what he is able to an&s;wer for him&s;elf: And in
<PB N="6" REF="7" MS="y">the mean time upon hear&s;ay or Su&s;pition for any to condemn another, were a great Inju&s;tice, though perhaps merely for his Relations and obligations to the former Court) there may be &s;ome grounds for this Su&s;pition; which al&s;o in the I&s;|&s;ue will prove rather an injurious Malice and Imagina|tion, than any thing of Reality and Truth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="objection">
<Q><HI>Object.</HI> 6. That he re&s;i&s;ted the Authority of Parliament, in oppo&s;ing Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h</HI> &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador by them.</Q>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 6. Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> denies he ever oppo&s;ed Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h,</HI> though he confe&s;&s;es he did not help him; nor had rea&s;on, except bet|ter warranted, than he ever could di&s;cover to him&s;elf to be to this day, he conceiving the Company not able to prove, that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> had any full Orders or effectual Commi&s;&s;ion from the Parliament to be either the Amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary, or Ordinary, for this Nation, with the Grand Seignor; the Ordinance of Parliament produced by them, directs his going Amba&s;&s;ador, or Agent, or Con&s;ull for the Merchants Af|fairs, not for the States; and this without any Super&s;edeas to Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> his Commi&s;&s;ion, or mention of this Revocation in it, or in any other Order by the Parliament, that he ever &s;aw or heard of. And Sir <HI>Tho.</HI> his Commi&s;&s;ion (if he had any at all, any legal one) ought to have been agreeable to that war|rant whereon it was grounded, which Sir <HI>Tho.</HI> his was not.</P>
<P N="2">2. But if Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> had any &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ion; yet if he ne|ver &s;hewed it, how could Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> be &s;aid to di&s;obey it? the truth is, he never &s;hewed it, nor pretended to any, but the late Kings Commi&s;&s;ion, which he refu&s;ed al&s;o to &s;hew, or any other war|rant, for his Mi&s;&s;ion, when needfull, and required by Sir <HI>Sa.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Be&s;ides tho&s;e Credentials delivered to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> brought with him for his Introduction, were under the High Commi&s;&s;ion Seal, and Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Arms (when
<PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y">that Office had been ca&s;t down by Parliament two years be|fore) And tho&s;e Seals never before that time &s;een beyond the Seas.</P>
<P N="4">4. And that Letter, which he brought for Sir <HI>Sa.</HI> his Revo|cation, was under a doubtfull, and no more authentique a Seal than the other, defaced at lea&s;t, and &s;o the Signature al&s;o, if not counterfeit.</P>
<P N="5">5. So that the whole frame of his pretended Emba&s;&s;ie, and every &s;tep of his toward it, being ju&s;tly to be &s;u&s;pected (Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> not being able to prove &s;o much as his Mi&s;|&s;ion, and refu&s;ing to &s;hew his Commi&s;sion) with the expence of 35000 <HI>l.</HI> levied on the Trade, and Nation, allowed (if not warranted) by the Company, purcha&s;ed his Introduction, and (into the Bargain) the per&s;on of Sir <HI>Sackvile</HI> to be rendred into his and the Companies pow|er, and thereon in&s;tantly (and without Warrant or Au|thority from the late King, the then Parliament, or this State) &s;ent him Pri&s;oner for <HI>England,</HI> plundred his Hou&s;e, &s;ei&s;ed his <HI>Cancellaria,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t the Papers of his Emba&s;&s;ie, Evi|dences of his E&s;tate, turned his Wife, Children, and Fa|mily out of their Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, and in a barbarous manner &s;ent them after.</P>
<P><HI>However</HI> upon the&s;e, and other like fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions by the Company, (to prolong their Sute) and after a ten years Impri&s;onment (hitherto without proof) through their Publique Clamours, and the Parliaments mi&s;-informa|tion, and their Incogni&s;ance hitherto of the Truth, by Or|der of the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, his Tryal at the Law (after Li|cence from the Protector, and Parliaments permi&s;&s;ion) was &s;topped, (Ju&s;t when all his Witne&s;&s;es were brought up to Town, &s;ome of them one hundred, and others two hun|dred miles off, the Jury &s;ummoned, his Council feed, and all things ready for a Hearing.)</P>
<P><HI>Which</HI> being contrary to all Pre&s;idents, con&s;tant Rules, and Declarations of all former Parliaments, he humbly yet
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="y">hopes (upon their better Information may be redre&s;&s;ed.) And (notwith&s;tanding his being under Reference up|on any Subjects pretence again&s;t him whatever) that he may yet enjoy the Privilege of a Free-man, till con|demned, and by their favour be left at liberty to &s;ue his particular Right at the Common law; The benefit whereof was never yet denied to any, that had not Iu|dicially forfeited it, which he is confident to affirm, hath not hitherto been made good; nor (by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of, and Iu&s;tice of the Committee) will ever be pro|ved again&s;t him.</P>
