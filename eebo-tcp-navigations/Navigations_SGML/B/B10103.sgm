<HEAD>THE SUCCESS of THE Two Engli&s;h Travellers Newly arrived in <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>To a New Iri&s;h Tune.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>AS we was a Ranging</L>
<L>upon the Salt Seas,</L>
<L>For <HI>France</HI> and for <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>our humours to plea&s;e;</L>
<L>But when we came there,</L>
<L>the fir&s;t News we did hear,</L>
<L>Was, you Rebels of <HI>England</HI></L>
<L>what do you do here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When we was a walking</L>
<L>along in the &s;treet,</L>
<L>Both Men, Wives and Children,</L>
<L>and all we did meet,</L>
<L>They gathered up &s;tones,</L>
<L>and at us did fling,</L>
<L>Cryed Rebels of <HI>England,</HI></L>
<L>you murther'd your King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this being odious</L>
<L>unto our own hearts,</L>
<L>Then from the <HI>French</HI></L>
<L>we were forc'd to depart;</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> did deride us,</L>
<L>with &s;cornful di&s;dain,</L>
<L>We hoi&s;ed up Top-&s;ail</L>
<L>and &s;ailed for <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when we came there,</L>
<L>we'd not &s;et foot on Land,</L>
<L>But &s;trait they perceiv'd</L>
<L>that we were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men,</L>
<L>VVith their hands on their Rapiers</L>
<L>their Cloaks off did fling,</L>
<L>Crying Rebels of <HI>England,</HI></L>
<L>you murther'd your King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this being odious</L>
<L>unto our conceits,</L>
<L>VVe hoi&s;ed and ha&s;tened</L>
<L>up into the <HI>Straits;</HI></L>
<L>Next Port unto <HI>Venice,</HI></L>
<L>intending to go,</L>
<L>Not fearing nor dreading</L>
<L>they did of it know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when we came there,</L>
<L>our Ships they did &s;can,</L>
<L>They &s;aw by our Colours,</L>
<L>we were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men,</L>
<L>O they laugh'd in their <HI>Lingo,</HI></L>
<L>and at us did fleer;</L>
<L>You Rebels of <HI>England</HI></L>
<L>what do you do here?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus twenty years wandring</L>
<L>from Sea-port to Town,</L>
<L>In all parts abu&s;ed,</L>
<L>re&s;olv'd to turn home:</L>
<L>We &s;teer'd up for <HI>London,</HI></L>
<L>but when we came there,</L>
<L>The Court all in Mourning,</L>
<L>put us in di&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then great <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>England,</HI></L>
<L>we found was interr'd,</L>
<L>And &s;ome known Offenders</L>
<L>in Mourning appear'd;</L>
<L>VVho for &s;ome years together,</L>
<L>had de&s;ign'd and &s;wore,</L>
<L>To &s;erve him as they did</L>
<L>his Father before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great <HI>James</HI> of his Birth-right,</L>
<L>they &s;ought to depo&s;e,</L>
<L>But now for ten Guinneys</L>
<L>you'l find none of tho&s;e,</L>
<L>King <HI>James</HI> is E&s;tabli&s;hed</L>
<L>&s;afe in his Throne,</L>
<L>And none &s;hall invade</L>
<L>the ju&s;t Rights of the Crown:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now we're re&s;olved</L>
<L>in <HI>England</HI> to &s;tay,</L>
<L>And wait for to &s;erve,</L>
<L>and our King to obey,</L>
<L>And his Royal Con&s;ort,</L>
<L>Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s ble&s;t Name:</L>
<L>And we'l drive both the <HI>French,</HI></L>
<L>and the <HI>Dutch</HI> o're the Main.</L>
