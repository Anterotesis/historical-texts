<P>_THe la&s;t great and &s;udden Fro&s;t, hath beene cau&s;e that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> gave over the &s;iege inten|ded again&s;t <HI>Landsberg:</HI> And having given order for the fortifying of &s;uch places as hee hath taken, and left good Garri&s;ons every where, finding no more Imperiall troops to drive out of <HI>Pomerania</HI> he went backe with his Armie, and having pa&s;t the River of <HI>Oder,</HI> entred into the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelburgh,</HI> where comming unlooked for among&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, (that lye here and there enquartered, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ive upon the Inhabitants, as their ma&s;ters, having a better re&s;olu|tion to eat and drinke than to fight) he awakened them with his warlike Mu&s;icke of thundering Ordnance and Muskets, mo&s;t un|plea&s;ing to them, and there made him&s;elfe ma&s;ter of divers good places and Townes; as, <HI>Friedland, Brvndenberg,</HI> and <HI>Malchin</HI> all the Imperiali&s;ts that are able to e&s;cape, flying away as fa&s;t as they can leaving every where their booties and goods, which they have the&s;e many yeeres robbed, behind them, unto their victorious enemies.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Tilly,</HI> he having written to the States of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> requiring them to receive into their Country &s;uch Imperiall forces as hee would &s;end thither, to bee enquartered there, and entertained by contribution untill winter &s;hould be pa&s;t, (promi&s;ing the number &s;hould not exceed 7000. men) and amplifying his Letters with many kind words; and complaints of the wants and mi&s;eries of the &s;aid Imperiall forces that came out of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and other parts thereabouts, to move the &s;aid States to compa&s;sion; hee received for all that, for all an&s;wer, a round denyall, grounded upon impo&s;|&s;ibilitie,
<PB N="2" REF="3">the people in that Country being &s;carce able to live with tho&s;e forces that are already lying upon them and whereof they did hope and expect to be freed very &s;hortly, le&s;t all might come to a ge|nerall rebellion.</P>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> him&s;elfe hath appointed his generall <HI>Rendez-vous</HI> for the Imperiall Forces at <HI>De&s;&s;aw,</HI> and hath &s;ent &s;ome troopes to <HI>Franck|fort</HI> on the <HI>Oder:</HI> But there is &s;mall &s;tore of victuals and munition to be found for them; and therefore great di&s;contentment among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Out of the Countries of <HI>Franconia, Suevia,</HI> and tho&s;e parts, there are now marching many Imperiall troopes towards <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and from <HI>Lindaw</HI> there are &s;ent that way 60.

Souldiers, having lived at ea&s;e, without any di&s;cipline, are very unwilling to march, where they &s;hall be no lon|ger commanders over the poore people, and therefore they runne a|way where they can e&s;cape. The Commanders and Officers them|&s;elves &s;eeme to have no great plea&s;ure to goe; where they will bee forced to u&s;e rather their Weapons again&s;t the Enemy, than hither|to they have done among&s;t tho&s;e that could not with&s;tand. I cannot expre&s;&s;e in words, how rigorou&s;ly it is proceeded again&s;t tho&s;e No|bles and Gentlemen of <HI>Franconia,</HI> who either them&s;elves or by &s;ome friends, brothers or fathers, have in time pa&s;t &s;erved again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> Their Lands, hou&s;es, and goods being daily ta|ken from them, by &s;uch as come eyther with Commi&s;sion or Let|ters of the Emperour, that be&s;towed the &s;ame on them. So that whole Families, their wives and children, are driven out, to &s;eeke where to live, being not &s;uffered to take the lea&s;t thing with them.

<P>THere is as yet no certainty, whether or no the Countries of <HI>Gu|lick</HI> and <HI>Berghen</HI> &s;hall be freed from the Troopes that lye there enquartered.

The Duke of <HI>Deuxponts,</HI> (a Prince Palatine that in time pa&s;t was Ad|mini&s;trator at <HI>Heydelberg</HI>) being diverted by other occa&s;ions from comming him&s;elfe, hath given his power and Commi&s;sion to the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;en.</HI> All the Prote&s;tant Imperiall Cities have &s;ent their Deputies thither; and the Circle of <HI>Suevia</HI> likewi&s;e, as al&s;o the Nobility of <HI>Franconia.</HI> The two Dukes of <HI>Meckelburg,</HI> (not|with&s;tanding that they are pro&s;cribed by the Emperour, and that the Duke of <HI>Friedland</HI> hath long &s;ince taken their Countrey) having beene invited thither by the Elector of <HI>Saxen,</HI> are al&s;o there.

<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath left (be&s;ides the Garri&s;ons of &s;uch places as he hath taken in <HI>Pomerania</HI>) behinde him in the March of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> an Armie of 9000 men. And <HI>Tilly</HI> (not knowing what that King intended when he went backe from before <HI>Landsberg</HI>) gave order for the fortifying of a place called <HI>Beskou,</HI> and &s;ent many troopes towards <HI>Franckfort</HI> on the <HI>Oder;</HI> which troopes doe there, and in all tho&s;e parts where now they are, commit &s;uch in&s;olencies, that it cannot be written: They de&s;troy and &s;poile all; and although there is but &s;mall, or in &s;ome places no provi&s;ion of victuals at all; yet what&s;oever they finde, it they are not able to con&s;ume the &s;ame, or if it is not worth the carrying away, they doe &s;poile, burne, or other|wi&s;e make it u&s;ele&s;&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of another Letter of the <HI>25.</HI> of February.</HEAD>
<P>IT is certaine that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath taken the good Towne of <HI>New-Brandenburgh,</HI> where there lay a Garri&s;on of Imper ali&s;ts, commanded by Colonell <HI>Marezan,</HI> who yeelded the &s;aid Towne by compo&s;ition, and went out (delivering the &s;ame to that brave King) with &s;ix hundred Souldiers, with promi&s;e not to &s;erve again&s;t the &s;aid King the&s;e three moneths.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>The nowes of this reddition being brought to <HI>Treptow,</HI> (ano|ther good Towne in the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelberg,</HI> and al&s;o kept by an Imperiall Garri&s;on) the Imperiali&s;ts therein fearing to get not &s;o good a condition, fled pre&s;ently, and &s;o left the Towne for the King, who being &s;peedily adverti&s;ed thereof, tooke the &s;ame al&s;o on the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>And we under&s;tand that be&s;ides the&s;e Townes, hee hath &s;ince ta|ken <HI>Malchin, Malchow, Dammin, Garbaw,</HI> and other places: So that he is already ma&s;ter of all the Dukedome of <HI>Meckelburg,</HI> &s;ave onely foure (but principall good) Townes; being <HI>Wi&s;mar, Ro&s;tock, Butzow,</HI> and <HI>Damitz,</HI> which is a &s;trong place, and lyeth upon the River of <HI>Elbe.</HI> What he intendeth now to doe, whether to be&s;iege one of tho&s;e Townes, or to goe towards <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> time mu&s;t teach us: for his intentions are kept in his owne bre&s;t.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Tilly,</HI> we under&s;tand that he had gathered together eight thou&s;and Imperiali&s;ts, with whom he marched towards <HI>Branden|burg,</HI> to hinder the &s;aid Kings comming towards <HI>Magdenburg.</HI></P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly of the Prote&s;tants began at <HI>Leip&s;ick,</HI> and the fir&s;t propo&s;ition hath beene made, but it is kept as yet &s;o &s;ecret, that we cannot heare what it con&s;i&s;ts of.</P>
<P>It is written from thence, that among&s;t other Amba&s;&s;adours and Deputies, there hath beene admitted an Amba&s;&s;adour that came from the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and another (whom they call <HI>Mon&s;ieur de L'i&s;le</HI>) from the French King. But it is much marvelled at, that the Cite of <HI>Hamburg</HI> hath not &s;ent any Deputie thither, &s;eeing <HI>Norim|berg, Franckfort,</HI> &amp; divers other &s;uch Cities (who are now in greater danger than <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and have beene warned by divers Electors, and commanded by the Imperiall Commi&s;s oners, not to &s;end any Deputy thither) have notwith&s;tanding &s;ent their Deputies with full power and Commi&s;sion.</P>
<P>Concerning the Countries of <HI>Gulick. Cleve,</HI> and <HI>Berghen,</HI> &amp;c. It is now certainely beleeved, that they &s;hall bee freed from all the troopes that lye therein, both of the Spaniards, Imperiali&s;ts, and the States: Her Highne&s;le the <HI>Infanta</HI> having publi&s;hed a Decree at <HI>Bruxels,</HI> bearing date the 19 of February la&s;t, whereby &s;hee &s;ignifi|eth, That upon their &s;tance of the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> Her Highne&s;&s;e doth grant unto the Innabitants to raze and breake downe all For|tifications that of late have beene made in the &s;aid lands of <HI>Gulicke, Cleve, Bergh, Marcke, Ravenspergh</HI> and <HI>Raven&s;tein,</HI> except only the

Vnder&s;tanding well this mi&s;|chiefe, which is &s;o much the more &s;en&s;ible unto us, in that for the pre&s;ent it deprives us of the fruit of all our care and paines, which have never any other ends but the ea&s;e of our people, which we have continually in our heart, as the prin|cipall &s;cope of all our de&s;ignes.

In the meane while certaine Committees were &s;ent out of the &s;aid Citie in the name of the 4 parts of Flanders to treat with his Excelle~ce concerning the contribution which was behind and had long time beene unpayd, in&s;omuch that they gave &s;e|curitie for entire payment of 10 yeares contribution. Where|upon his Excell with his whole Army departed, and the verie &s;ame night tooke his re&s;ting place at <HI>Maldegom,</HI> where we pa&s;|&s;ed the 5 of <HI>Iune</HI> over the river <HI>Lieve</HI> towards <HI>Walichem</HI> and from thence toward <HI>Eckelo,</HI> and <HI>Caprick,</HI> and the 7 of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">une re|turned backe with our whole armie at <HI>Watervliet,</HI> where his Excell. in&s;tantly cau&s;ed retrenchments to be ca&s;t up all along the <HI>Holland Dike,</HI> for the better en&s;uring of his armie, &s;o that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n
