<LG>
<L>_THat noble and that ancient Town</L>
<L><HI>Dumbrittain</HI> glorious for renown,</L>
<L>That &s;tands upon the Silver &s;ides,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Leven</HI> wa&s;h't with Tydes:</L>
<L>Two Rivers &s;corning to change names,</L>
<L>With <HI>Tweed,</HI> or <HI>Forth,</HI> nay not with <HI>Thames;</HI></L>
<L>More venerable none can be,</L>
<L>If we re&s;pect antiquity:</L>
<L>Or if we look to Situation,</L>
<L>She is the pride of all the Nation;</L>
<L>Her port, &s;o &s;afe, &s;o calm, &s;o fair,</L>
<L>Sole object of the Seaman's pray'r;</L>
<L>Her Fort of &s;uch magnificence,</L>
<L>Is boa&s;ted <HI>Scotland</HI>'s chiefe defence;</L>
<L>Environ'd with the &s;calie legions,</L>
<L>The Burgers of the brinnie regions;</L>
<L>Her Buildings Graceful, and her Fields</L>
<L>Plea&s;ure and profit jointly yields:</L>
<L>All the&s;e are worthy of great prai&s;e,</L>
<L>For which this Town de&s;erves the bayes;</L>
<L>But in this one She doth excell,</L>
<L>And from all others bears the <HI>BELL,</HI></L>
<L>That in the&s;e awle&s;s Lawle&s;s times,</L>
<L>Famous for Faction and for Crimes,</L>
<L>She and She only &s;trives to be,</L>
<L>Famous for pious Loyalty.</L>
<L>Therefore Commi&s;&s;ioners has &s;ent,</L>
<L>Indulged Traitours to prevent.</L>
<L>Her very common Bells do ring,</L>
<L>Obedience unto the <HI>KING,</HI></L>
<L>That nothing in the Town may be,</L>
<L>But what may &s;ound their Loyalty,</L>
<L>Ev'n ju&s;t like <HI>A'rons</HI> Bells of Gold,</L>
<L>That did both &s;ound and teach of old.</L>
<L><HI>Dumbrittans</HI> Bell as ye &s;hall hear,</L>
<L>Can charm the Heart, and Chim the eare,</L>
<L>An in&s;tance whereof ye may mark,</L>
<L>In hone&s;t <HI>Thomas Walker</HI> Clerk,</L>
<L>A Man who from this very &s;tory,</L>
<L>May reckon'd be <HI>Dumbrittains</HI> Glory;</L>
<L>Ju&s;t like the Town Clerk in the Acts,</L>
<L>That was made Famous by &s;uch Facts;</L>
<L>Tho he did but appea&s;e a &s;trife,</L>
<L>But <HI>Thomas</HI> did convert his Wife,</L>
<L>And therefore in records of Fame,</L>
<L>De&s;erves a farr more noble Name;</L>
<L>This was the way he her converted,</L>
<L>To Conventicles She had &s;tarted,</L>
<L>Wherefore he vow'd Her to divor&s;e,</L>
<L>And would admitt of no remor&s;e,</L>
<L>And that all men might clearly &s;ee,</L>
<L>How Zealous he re&s;olv'd to bee,</L>
<L>He for the skillet <HI>Bell</HI> doth call,</L>
<L>To roap what was in Hou&s;e or Hall;</L>
<L>That &s;o She might for ay de&s;pair</L>
<L>His per&s;on, or his goods to &s;hare.</L>
<L>The <HI>Bell</HI> doth clank, the Rogue doth cry,</L>
<L>Who'le <HI>Thomas Walkers</HI> Goods, come buy;</L>
<L>For <HI>Thomas</HI> he his Wife will bani&s;h,</L>
<L>And his whole Hou&s;e he will di&s;pleni&s;h,</L>
<L>And teach all Husbands to their &s;hame.</L>
<L>A Wife's ane ea&s;ie thing to tame.</L>
<L>The Woman come of ancient race,</L>
<L>The <HI>Wat&s;ons</HI> chief Men of that plac&punc;</L>
<L>Who for their valiant Loyal<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span"></L>
<L>Were gifted with the Sacred Tree.</L>
<L>Then which their's no Tree unto fate.</L>
<L>A Tennant of a longer date;</L>
<L>The <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> for his Manly &s;troake,</L>
<L>Doth in his Arms bear the Oake.</L>
<L>Gentle She, and melting hearted,</L>
<L>At the fir&s;t noi&s;e of this She &s;tarted,</L>
<L>And ay the more the <HI>Bell</HI> it &s;ounded,</L>
<L>The more, the more She was confounded,</L>
<L>And now She thought the time was come</L>
<L>That She would get Queen <HI>Va&s;hties</HI> D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter">om</L>
<L>And did begin to fear the wor&s;t,</L>
<L>And in Her Heart <HI>Phanaticks</HI> cur&s;t,</L>
<L>And their debau&s;ht and lawle&s;s Meetings,</L>
<L>That are Prophane and Godle&s;s Cheatings,</L>
<L>That di&s;cord make in Church and State,</L>
<L>And in all Families debate.</L>
<L>But chiefly thought Her &s;elf accur&s;t,</L>
<L>That from Her dear mu&s;t be divorc't:</L>
<L>Her head was full of dolefull notions:</L>
<L>Her Heart with melancholy motions:</L>
<L>Her words with &s;ighs all chequered are,</L>
<L>And with Her hair Her hands made Warr</L>
<L>But &s;till the <HI>Bells</HI> mo&s;t &s;hamefull &s;ound;</L>
<L>Her heart with grief did mo&s;t confound.</L>
<L>And had not Friends by Interce&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Caus'd <HI>Thomas</HI> pardon Her Trangre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="4 letters"></L>
<L>Then &s;uddenly Her fatal Breath</L>
<L>Had pay'd it's la&s;t arrears to Death</L>
<L>But now all Per&s;ons Her do &s;ee</L>
<L>A Zealot in Conformity.</L>
<L>Who Poy&s;on in Her Meat would d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 span"></L>
