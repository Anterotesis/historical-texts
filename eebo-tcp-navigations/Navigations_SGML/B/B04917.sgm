<HEAD>A Particular Relation of the rai&s;ing of the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the Defeat of the Turki&s;h Army on the 12th of <HI>September,</HI> 1683.</HEAD>
<P>YOu have already had &s;everal Relations of the great Victory which the Confe|derate Army obtained against the Turks the twelfth instant, but none &s;o exact and particular as that we now give you. The Turks after a Siege of nine Weeks, had reduced this place to that extremity, that it could not have held out <HI>48.</HI> houres longer, for our Provi&s;ions failed, our Gari&s;on which at first was about <HI>12000.</HI> men, was brought to <HI>6000.</HI> having &s;uffered more by &s;ickne&s;s than by the Enemy, and the Turks had three Mines ready to &s;pring, which would in|fallibly have blown up the la&s;t Retrenchment we had made for our &s;ecurity within the Town, when the Chri&s;tian Army with the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance happily reliev|ed us: Which they would not &s;o ea&s;ily have done, had the Grand Vi&s;ier &s;ecured the pa&s;&s;ages of the Wood and other Po&s;ts (which the Christians found difficult enough to pa&s;&s;e, even though they met with no oppo&s;ition) but either for want of Foot, or through a vain confidence of his own &s;trength, having &s;till an Army of <HI>120000.</HI> fighting men, he neglected the&s;e advantages.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of between <HI>70.</HI> and <HI>80000.</HI> men, ad|vancing towards this place, a great Body of Hor&s;e and Dragoons was &s;ent on the 11th to &s;eize the chief Pa&s;&s;ages and Avenues of the Wood, which the Army having afterward pa&s;&s;ed, they po&s;ted them&s;elves in the evening at the entrance of the Wood, on the &s;ide towards the Enemy, and there being a hill at a &s;mall di&s;tance from them, &s;ome Troops were &s;ent to &s;ecure it, and all things were di&s;|po&s;ed for the Battel the next day; the right Wing was given to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> for that he had the mo&s;t Hor&s;e, and that the Countrey was on that &s;ide open; the left to the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> becau&s;e they were &s;trongest in Foot, and that it was an enclo&s;ed Countrey all along the <HI>Denube:</HI> and the main Body to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and Prince <HI>Waldecke.</HI> The next morning by break of day, the Generals, according to appointment, met on the Hill before mentioned, to give the la&s;t Orders, and were no &s;ooner come thither, but a Body of about <HI>10000.</HI> Turks appeared, and advanced towards the Christians, whereupon a Battalion was ordered to put them&s;elves into a Vine|yard that was on a Hill hard by, being &s;upported by three other Battalions, which made the Turks &s;top, for not enduring the Fire of the &s;aid Battalions, and be|ing all Hor&s;e, and in a Ground where they could not well attack the Foot, they contented them&s;elves with making one Di&s;charge, accompanied with a hideous noi&s;e, and &s;o retired. Hereupon the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the other Princes having ob&s;erved the di&s;po&s;ition of the Enemy, drew the Army in three Lines, all clo&s;ed without any Intervals, and Ordered them to march very &s;lowly towards the Enemy, and to stand when the Turks came to Charge them, to keep them&s;elves very clo&s;e, and not to Fire till the Enemy had made their di&s;charge, which was accordingly done. The Enemy advanced towards them with a horrible cry, as if they meant to break in upon them, hoping thereby to make them give w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> or to put them into di&s;order, but perceiving that the Chri&s;tians &s;tood firm, and expect|ed them in a very clo&s;e order, they dur&s;t not pu&s;h any farther, but made a halt, and finding the Chri&s;tians did not &s;tir, but stood expecting them, they made their di&s;charge and wheeled off, upon which all the fir&s;t Line of the Christians fired, and that done, the whole Army advanced with a &s;low pace, and &s;o gained ground upon the Enemy, who returning, came up as before, the Christians thereupon made a halt, and expected them, and the Turks having made their Di&s;charge, again retired, which they repeated &s;everal times without ever daring to break in upon the Chri&s;tians, who &s;till gained Ground, and drove the Turks before them like a flock of Sheep; Being come near the Enemies Camp, a Body of Foot and
<PB N="2" REF="2">Dragoons was detached to attack their Cannon, which they made them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of without much Oppo&s;ition, the Enemy having but a &s;mall number of Foot to defend them, and even their Hor&s;e made no great re&s;i&s;tance in any place, though on the &s;ide of the right Wing, they endeavoured to charge the Chri&s;tians in Flank, but the King of <HI>Poland</HI> mi&s;trusting it, cau&s;ed part of the &s;econd Line to advance, and make a Front on that &s;ide, and charging the Enemy in Per&s;on with the first Line, made them give way. During the hotte&s;t of the Battel, the Turks attack|ed the Town, and pre&s;&s;ed the Be&s;ieged &s;o hard, that the Count <HI>De Staremberg</HI> was forced to &s;end to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with the help whereof, all the Turks that were in the Attack were cut in pieces. In conclu&s;ion, towards night the Enemy began to give way and to fly, the Chri&s;tians pur&s;uing them beyond their Camp, and there they made a halt, the Souldiers being commanded upon pain of death not to &s;tir out of their Ranks, and the whole Army remained all night in Battalia, as if the Enemy had been &s;till pre&s;ent. The next day the Camp was plundered, half of a Company going out at a time, while the other half continu|ed in Arms, and when they returned, the&s;e went out in like manner. All the Enemies Baggage, Provi&s;ions, Tents, <HI>50.</HI> pieces of Cannon, two Hor&s;e-Tails, the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Standard, and the <HI>Vi&s;iers</HI>'s own Hor&s;e were taken, and mo&s;t of their Foot were cut in pieces, which it's believed was not above <HI>12.</HI> or <HI>15000.</HI> they having lo&s;t an incredible number during the Siege. This great Vi|ctory which was obtained at &s;o cheap a rate, that the Chri&s;tians lo&s;t not a <HI>1000.</HI> men, and very few Per&s;ons of Note, (the Duke <HI>de Croy,</HI> and &s;ome others being wound|ed) must in great mea&s;ure be attributed to the great Conduct and Bravery of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who engaged in Per&s;on among the thicke&s;t of the Enemy, having with him the Prince his elde&s;t Son, but <HI>15.</HI> years old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> who thus early &s;ignalized him&s;elf; the Electors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Prince <HI>Waldecke,</HI> have likewi&s;e gained great Honour and Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">utation, much of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of this great Day being due to them.</P>
