<HEAD>An EXACT and TRUE ACCOUNT Of the taking Five FRENCH SHIPS Laden with AMMUNITION, By the <HI>Dutch,</HI> de&s;ign'd for <HI>Ireland:</HI> Together with the particulars of the Blowing up of <HI>D&V;NKIRK</HI> by the Magazine taking Fire.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Letters &s;ay, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Letters confirm, that Five <HI>French</HI> Ships laden in the Port of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with all &s;orts of Mu|nitions of War, and going under the Convoy of two of their &s;mall Fri|gats de&s;ign'd for <HI>Ireland,</HI> were intercepted and taken by three <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of Wat; the <HI>French</HI> Convoys, after receiving the fir&s;t Broad|&s;ide, &s;heeting off, e&s;caped; and they are now actually brought into <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where being examined into, are found to be Freighted with the&s;e following Parti|culars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>In one of them are 16 Demi-Culverins upon Carriages, with Sponges. Ladies and all other Materials thereto, as Traces, and Harne&s;s for the Draught of Hor&s;es 236 Barrels of Gunpowder. 6000 Iron Bullets. 120 Quintals of Match. 500 Barrels of Mu&s;quet. Carbine, and Pi&s;tol-&s;hot. 1500 Chevaux de Frize. 400 Tune&s;piks. 8 Gabions, and other Baskets. 7000 Mattocks, as many Shovels. 300 Wheel Barrows. 2 Mortars 600 Bombs, from 60 to 100 <HI>l.</HI> weight each. 6000 Hor&s;e-&s;hoes. 2000 Saddles, as many Bridles, with Hol&s;ters for Pi&s;tols, and Cruppers. 4000 New Tents. 3000 Firelock Mu&s;quets. 2000 Matchlocks. 1000 Fu&s;ees 6000 Swords, Bandaliers, Belts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with much other Materials, too long to in&s;ert, all which are condemned as Prize, and are to be brought to <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> and the greate&s;t part order'd to <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> and <HI>Breda</HI> for the u&s;e of the States Army. And this direful Misfortune (as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb denotes, <HI>&s;eldom Comes Alone</HI>) is u&s;hered in with another wor&s;e than that before mention'd; where|of take the Particulars.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dunkirk</HI> there happen'd a Terrible and Surprizing Di&s;a&s;ter in the <HI>French</HI> Gar|ri&s;on there: For the &s;ame being look'd upon the Metropolitan over all the <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;ons in the New Conque&s;ts in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whereby mighty Stores of all &s;orts of Munitions of War were Repo&s;ited, for the carrying on the De&s;igns of <HI>Leuis</HI> the XIV, was by one Fatal Blow and Di&s;a&s;ter, through the Negligence of a Drunken Workman, or Soldier, with a lighted Pipe of Tobacco, entirely Blown up and De|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The certainty of the Occa&s;ion cannot be authentickly known, becau&s;e the Powder gave no minutes for Enquiry, but precipitatly carried all before it into the Region of the Air, which as it was more Inclu&s;ive, had greater Exten&s;ive E&s;&s;icacy on the Garri&s;on, it having de&s;troyed and wholly mined one Third of the Interiour Fortifi|cations,
<PB REF="2">and made a large Breach in the Wall of the Side towards the Sea, there be|ing computed 2000 Barrels of Powder to be lo&s;t, which is an extreme Injury to <HI>France,</HI> the &s;ame being valued at eight Pounds ten Shillings <HI>Sterling</HI> each Barrel, be&s;ides the Store of Arms and Ammunition adjoining, are either broke to pieces, or burned in the Ruines, there not being one part of the &s;aid Garri&s;on, but what re|ceived its dreadful Effects, either by the de&s;truction of the Hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ome People therein, the tops of all the Buildings, being either carried away, or broke down afterwards with the Stoues, or other ponderous weight which fell thereon. And the Damage is almo&s;t Irreparable, one hundred thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> being not &s;ufficient to put it into its pri&s;tine Condition, for the terrible Shock which it made, has created a great many Cracks and di&s;mal Ca&s;ma's in the very Wall of the Fortifications, which mu&s;t be wholly taken down to the ground to be repaired, otherwi&s;e Untenable; and upon a &s;trict Examination, about 530 people, as well Soldiers as Inhabitants, have peri&s;hed in this <HI>Cata&s;trophe,</HI> among them 43 Officers, and above 300 others are mi&s;erably &s;hatter'd or wounded with the Stones: And there are &s;ome which conclude that it was occa&s;ioned by the Treachery of &s;eve|tie new Convert Soldiers, but con&s;idering that the per&s;on which perpetrated it, was a Companion in the mi&s;ery which en&s;ued; we believe that it was more Misfortune than De&s;ign; and the rather, for that it was known, that a con&s;iderable Quantity of Powder brought from Foreign parts, had, by the Saline and Vaporous Quality of the Sea received &s;ome Detriment, whereby it was drying, and making again &s;er|viceable. However it was (as all Advantages with Enemies are be&s;t) it betokens a lucky progre&s;s of A&s;&s;airs to all the Confederates in the en&s;uing Campagnes e&s;pe|cially in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to which place the &s;aid Powder was principally de&s;ign'd, and where we do not doubt the <HI>French</HI> Rhodomantado's as &s;oon as ap|pear, will vani&s;h in Smoke.</P>
