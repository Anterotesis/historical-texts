<HEAD>A Letter from Gen. BLAKES fleet Dated in the <HI>Downes</HI> the third of <HI>October</HI> 1652.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ON the 25 of <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1652. There was a great meeting of the Of|ficers of the Fleet with General <HI>Blake,</HI> about engaging with the Hollanders then about <HI>Goodwin</HI> Sands, and it was re&s;olved after &s;everall mee|tings, that on Tue&s;day la&s;t we &s;hould ende|vour to ingage with them.</P>
<P>And accordingly, on Tue&s;day la&s;t we &s;ai|led towards them, and the Hollanders &s;tood to us; being well manned, and every ways very well fitted, and about our number, each party being between 50 and 60 &s;ail, and the Hollanders had two Admirals.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>Fir&s;t Major <HI>Bourne</HI> with the <HI>Andrew</HI> led on, and charged the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;toutly, and got off again without much harme.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Bodily</HI> with his &s;hip al&s;o (for we have one of the <HI>Bodelies</HI> a Captain with us, be&s;ides Capt. <HI>Bodely</HI> in the Straits,) hee char|ged exceeding gallantly; but was in very great danger to have lo&s;t his &s;hip, for the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;o clo&s;e on both &s;ides of him. charging again&s;t him, that one might have flung biskets out of his Frigot into the Dutch &s;hips.</P>
<P>All his &s;ailes were &s;o torne and &s;hattered, that he could not &s;ail either too or fro, or any more but as the Tide drove him, and there were about 60 men killed in that Frigot, and &s;he had near 100 &s;hot in her Hul, and was in danger of &s;inking or taking.</P>
<P>But ble&s;&s;ed be God they got her &s;afe to Harbour, the fight being not above 6 leagues from the &s;hoar.</P>
<P>The w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ter being &s;hallow upon the &s;ands, we were in &s;ome danger of &s;u&s;taining great lo&s;&s;e, In &s;o much that the Sovereign, and the
<PB N="3" REF="3">&s;hip in which Gen. Blake was, with the Ad|miral began to &s;tick, but ble&s;&s;ed be God were got off again without any great harm there|by.</P>
<P>The Sovereign that great Ship, a delicate Frigot (I think the whole World hath not the like) did her part, &s;he &s;ailed through and through the Holland Fleet, and played hard upon them.</P>
<P>And at one time there were about 20 Holland Frigots upon her, but ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord &s;he hath &s;u&s;tained no very great lo&s;&s;e, but in &s;ome of her Tacklings, and &s;ome &s;hot in her which her great bigne&s;&s;e is not much preju|diced with.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome other lo&s;&s;es in &s;everal other &s;hips, &s;ome 2 or 3 in &s;ome &s;hips &s;laine, and in others twice or thrice that number: and &s;ome of the &s;hips had lo&s;&s;e more, and &s;ome le&s;&s;e, in their Sailes and Tacklings.</P>
<P>We fought them &s;tifly as long that night as from foure a clock untill we could not &s;ee to fight longer.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded that if we had had day to
<PB N="4" REF="4">have pro&s;ecuted the fight, we had ut|terly &s;poyled them, and yet I am per|&s;waded that their lo&s;&s;e is very great.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders Vice-Admirall</HI> was &s;unk in our &s;ight, a very great and &s;tout &s;hip.</P>
<P>Al&s;o another very good Frigot, and of a good bulke, we &s;aw &s;ink in our view.</P>
<P>Two of their &s;hips we have taken, one of 30 guns, and the other of 36 guns, neither of which did much op|po&s;e us, after we attempted to board them. By which we perceive that their hearts are much broken, and they are much di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>VVe hear of two &s;hips more of theirs &s;ince &s;unk, &s;ome &s;ay three, but of that I cannot yet a&s;&s;ure you the certainty, but ble&s;&s;ed be God we lo&s;t not one &s;hip.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>VVe pur&s;ued them the next day, and made &s;ome di&s;covery of them, and &s;ent out &s;ome ve&s;&s;els towards them, but they fled, and &s;ailed away, we pur&s;ued them neer <HI>Holland,</HI> but could not get them to ingage.</P>
<P>I beleeve it will be &s;ad news to the States; and although they thought to have foundered our &s;hips in the &s;ands, yet ble&s;&s;ed be God, we have gotten the Victory, and they are fled home by the weeping cro&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>VVe are come back now to the <HI>Downes</HI> where we are to take in &s;up|plies, and then &s;hall indeavour to act further &s;ervice, as God &s;hall give us occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were drunk generally the mo&s;t part of them when they fought, for at fir&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="5">they fought exceeding de&s;perately, as ever I &s;aw; but after &s;ome hours, were nothing &s;o valiant.</P>
<P>But let God have all the glory, we went forth in his &s;trength, and I hope &s;hall &s;till wait on him, who hath thus far manife&s;ted his pre&s;ence with us, and ble&s;&s;ing upon us.</P>
<P>All our Captains generally played their parts, and &s;o did the Sea men and the Soul|diers, who plyed their work, in di&s;charging upon the Enemy, though &s;ome of the men were up to the middle in water in &s;ome of the &s;hips.</P>
