<HEAD>A LETTER from <HI>MOSCOW</HI> TO THE Marque&s;s of <HI>CARMARTHEN,</HI> Relating to the Czar of Mu&s;covy's Forwardne&s;s in his GREAT NAVY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Since His <HI>RETURN</HI> Home.</HEAD>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Mo&s;cow, <DATE><HI>March</HI> 8. 1698/9. <HI>O.S.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have deferr'd writing, till I could be able to give Your Lord&s;hip a true Account (from my own Knowledge) of the <HI>Czar</HI> (our Ma&s;ter's) Navy, which being a New Thing in the World as yet, I believe is variou&s;ly talk'd of in <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> Fir&s;t, At <HI>Voronize</HI> there is already in the Water and Rigg'd, 36, and to be Launch'd in the Spring 20 more &s;tout Ships, from 30 to 60 Guns. Next, 18 very large Gallies (built after the <HI>Venetian</HI> manner by <HI>Italian</HI> Ma&s;ters) are already compleated; and 100 &s;maller Gallies or Brigantines are equipt for the Sea; 7 Bomb-Ships are Launch'd and Rigg'd, and 4 Fire&s;hips are Building again&s;t the Spring, when they are all to go down to <HI>Azoph.</HI> The Ships are chiefly built by the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>The 25th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Mo&s;cow, incognito;</HI> immediately he took in hand the rewarding of General <HI>Gordon</HI>'s Soldiers, that fought again&s;t the Re|bels he defeated in <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, and next day gave Orders to fetch up all tho&s;e of the Rebels who were di&s;per&s;ed by way of Bani&s;hment, which were in all then left about 2700. I &s;uppo&s;e Your Lord&s;hip has been inform'd by Publick News, how they are hung round the Walls of this City, &s;ome hundreds beheaded, &s;ome broke upon the Wheel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the whole Number of them, which was in all 3000.</P>
<P>At my Arrival in <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> I fell very ill of the Bloody-Flux, which made me be in <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> when his Maje&s;ty came home: About the latter end of <HI>October</HI> I was &s;omewhat recovered, his Maje&s;ty then carried me down to <HI>Voronize</HI> with him. <HI>Voro|nize</HI> is about 400 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> from <HI>Mo&s;cow.</HI> There the <HI>Czar</HI> immediate|ly &s;et up a Ship of 60 Guns, where he is both Foreman and Ma&s;ter-Builder; and not to flatter him, I'le a&s;&s;ure Your Lord&s;hip it will be the be&s;t Ship among them, and 'tis all from his own Draught: How he fram'd her together, and how he made the Mould, and in &s;o &s;hort a time as he did, is really wonderful: But he is able at this day to put his own Notions into Practice, and laugh at his <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Builders for their Ignorance. There are &s;everal Pieces of Workman&s;hip, as in the Keel, Stem, and Po&s;t, which are all purely his own Invention, and &s;ound good Work, and would be approved of by all the Shipwrights of <HI>England,</HI> if they &s;aw it. She has a round Tuck, and a narrow Floor, a good tumbling Home, and Circular Side; none are to exceed 11 <HI>Dutch</HI> Foot Draught of Water. He has not run into any Extreme, But taken the Mediums of all good Sailing Properties, which &s;eem be&s;t. One may, methinks, call her an Ab&s;tract of his own private Ob&s;ervations whil&s;t Abroad, &s;trengthned by Your Lord&s;hip's Improving Di&s;cour&s;es to him on that Sub|ject, and his own extraordinary Notion of Sailing. One thing as to her Keel is, That &s;hould it wholly be beat out, yet it is &s;o ordered, that the Ship will be tight and &s;afe, and may continue &s;o at Sea afterwards.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e made a Suit of Moulds for a Ship of Sixty Guns, but after &s;ome time fell &s;ick again; and at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> when his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> he brought me back again for Recovery of my Health, where I am at pre&s;ent; notwith&s;tanding, both our
<PB REF="2" MS="y">Ships go forward, having put things in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as that a <HI>Grecian</HI> (who has been in <HI>England</HI>) carries on the Bu&s;ine&s;s. Mr. <HI>Ney</HI> is Building of a 60 Gun Ship there too; be&s;ides, there are four of that Size (near built) upon the <HI>Done,</HI> two of 40 Guns already at <HI>Azoph,</HI> carried down &s;ome time &s;ince, and a great many Galleys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Rivers <HI>Vorona,</HI> at <HI>Voronitz,</HI> when I was there, was hardly &s;o broad as the Ships are long; but in the Spring about the latter End of <HI>April,</HI> or beginning of <HI>May,</HI> when the Snow melts, there is 16 Foot Water in that little River, and continues this height about 12 or 14 days, with a Rapid Torrent, with that force, that though it be 1000 Miles down to <HI>Azoph,</HI> yet the Ships will ea&s;ily be there in 9 or 10 days. There is 30000 Soldiers at <HI>Voronize,</HI> to defend the Ships from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who are very mi&s;chievous, and very &s;wift in &s;etting a place on Fire, and running away again. Tho&s;e Ships that are Launcht lie fa&s;t in Ice about two Foot thick, &s;o that the River is now as firm as Land, although this is reckoned a very mild Winter; for I remember in <HI>January</HI> one Afternoon with a <HI>Southerly</HI> Wind it thaw'd and rain'd for 3 or 4 hours, which is rare enough for an Almanack. The Ground is covered with Snow about a Yard deep, and 'tis mighty clear, piercing cold Weather, &s;uch as in <HI>England</HI> we can't imagine.</P>
<P>Looking again&s;t the Sun, one may &s;ee innumerable Atoms of congeal'd Snow, flying up and down the Sky like Du&s;t; but within Doors the Rooms are about as warm as 'tis in <HI>June</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> made &s;o by Stoves, all over of a &s;oft familiar heat. As to the Temper of the Climate in general, the Summers (as la&s;t was) are ex|ce&s;&s;ive hot, the Winter as cold; the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> and part of <HI>May,</HI> the Coun|try is almo&s;t drown'd by exce&s;&s;ive overflowings of the Rivers, occa&s;ioned by the melted Snow. The Land in Summer is plea&s;ant all over, and fertil, and all provi|&s;ions wonderful cheap; as, a good fat Sheep for four Shillings, Bread, Beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pro|portionably; and even now in Winter 'tis not much dearer. I hope by this time Twelve-Months, to give Your Lord&s;hip (in <HI>England</HI>) a particular De&s;cription of the Country by word of Mouth. His Maje&s;ty was at my Chamber two days of la&s;t Week, with Mr. <HI>Styles</HI> as Interpreter (who gives his humble duty to Your Lord&s;hip) You may gue&s;s what His Maje&s;ty came to be inform'd in whil&s;t he was there; I &s;hew'd him a Model of a Machine to bring up the <HI>Royal Tran&s;port</HI> to the <HI>Volga,</HI> at 17 Inches Draught of Water; he was pleas'd to like it, but gave no Orders for put|ting it in Execution, &s;o I believe &s;he will lie where &s;he is now, and peri&s;h. Here are Three Envoys, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Emperor's,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgs,</HI> in this <HI>Slabado,</HI> (as it is call'd,) which lies from <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> as <HI>Lambeth</HI> does from <HI>London.</HI> The whole place is Inhabited by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> I believe there may be 400 Families. La&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Monday</HI> the Strangers were invited to the Con&s;ecration of General <HI>La Fort</HI>'s New Hou&s;e, which is the noble&s;t Building in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and finely furni&s;ht. There were all the Envoys, and as near as I could gue&s;s 200 Gentlemen, <HI>Engli&s;h, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and about as many Ladies; each Day were Dancing and Mu&s;ick. All the Envoys, and all the Lords (but three in <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI>) are going to <HI>Voronize</HI> to &s;ee the Fleet, I &s;uppo&s;e. His Maje&s;ty went la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> to <HI>Voronize</HI> with Prince <HI>Alexander,</HI> and I am to go down (being &s;omething recovered) with the Vice-Admiral about &s;ix days hence. This day was a Mu&s;ter of all the Seamen and Officers in his Maje&s;ty's Service, &frac34; of which are di&s;charg'd: They are to go home by the way of <HI>Narve.</HI> Capt. <HI>Perry,</HI> who was &s;ent to make a Communication between the Rivers <HI>Volga</HI> and <HI>Done,</HI> near <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> is returned from Surveying the &s;ame; he makes it appear Fea&s;ible enough to be done; accordingly his Maje&s;ty has ordered 40000 Men to be rais'd, and Materials provided for doing the &s;ame; which he has promis'd to fini&s;h in Five years, tho' I believe it may be done in le&s;s. When that is perform'd, then the <HI>Czar</HI> may carry his Ships from the <HI>Black Sea</HI> into the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> and extend his Conque&s;t that way.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> What I have writ, I wi&s;h it may be any Satisfaction to Your Lord|&s;hip, and I have my End, who am,</P>
