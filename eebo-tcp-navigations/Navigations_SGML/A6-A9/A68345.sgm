<HEAD>The Duchie of Gelders.</HEAD>
<P>_THere is great contradicti|on of opinions betwixt both ancient and moderne writers touching the fir&s;t beginning of the <HI>Geldrois,</HI> the which they can hardly reconcile, neither will I vnder-take the charge. <HI>Marlian</HI> &s;aith, that in <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ars</HI> time, the con|trie which is now called <HI>Gelders,</HI> was inhabited by the <HI>Menapiens.</HI> Others hold that it was the aboad of the <HI>Sicambrians,</HI> where-vnto I will yeeld, and that vnder that name the <HI>Cleuois</HI> were compre|hended: through who&s;e country, as well as through <HI>Gelders</HI> the riuer of <HI>Rhine</HI> doth runne: the which doth ca&s;t one of his branches betwixt the Duchies of <HI>Gelders</HI> and <HI>Cleues,</HI> being called <HI>Wahal,</HI> at the diui&s;ion of the Iland of <HI>Sgrauen-Weerdt,</HI> where that mighty fort was fir&s;t built by Collonell <HI>Martin Schenck,</HI> and at this day in great e&s;teeme. For which Iland there hath bin long de|bate betwixt the Dukes of <HI>Gelders</HI> and <HI>Cleues,</HI> the
<PB N="2" REF="6">
which is not yet decided, &amp; was begun betwixt the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and <HI>William</HI> duke of <HI>Cleues,</HI> father to this la&s;t Duke. The <HI>Battauians</HI> or <HI>Hollanders</HI> did al&s;o hold a part of that which is now called <HI>Gelders.</HI> There is no doubt but in <HI>Cae|&s;ars</HI> time, the <HI>Sicambrians</HI> did inhabit on either|&s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> in the countries of <HI>Cleues</HI> and <HI>Geldres:</HI> as <HI>Wezel</HI> on the one &s;ide, with <HI>Burich, Cleef</HI> and others of the other &s;ide are of the Du|chy of <HI>Cleues:</HI> And of <HI>Geldres, Nymegen</HI> lies of the one &s;ide and <HI>Arnham</HI> on the other, &s;o as we may rightly &s;ay that the riuers of <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Wahal</HI> do run through the&s;e two Prouinces: for the <HI>Sicam|brians</HI> hauing often bin defeated by the <HI>Romains, Augu&s;tus</HI> (who &s;ucceeded <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> as <HI>Strabo, Sucto|nius</HI> &amp; others do write) to be the better a&s;&s;ured of them, and to keepe them in awe, tran&s;ported a good number of them with other people on this &s;ide the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and there planted them. I will not deny that the <HI>Menapians</HI> did not fir&s;t inhabit all that country which lies along the riuer of <HI>Rhine,</HI> to whom the <HI>Sicambrians</HI> did afterwards &s;uc|ceed, who enioyed a great continent of ground, on the one &s;ide as far as the <HI>Vbiens,</HI> and on the o|ther vnto the ocean &s;ea. The which <HI>Marlian</HI> con|firmes by the&s;e words. The <HI>Sicambrians</HI> planted wheras the two great riuers of <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> do meet and ioyne, extend them&s;elues vnto the ocean &s;ea&punc; And in another place he &s;aith.

beyond the riuer of <HI>Rhine</HI> nere vnto the <HI>Vbiens</HI> and <HI>Eburones,</HI> which are the people of <HI>Cologne &amp; Liege.</HI> So as wee cannot &s;ay that tho&s;e which at this day are called <HI>Geldrois</HI> had the name of <HI>Si|cambrians</HI> onely, but that vnder that name were al&s;o comprehended, they of <HI>Cleues, Monts, Marck &amp; Iulliers&punc;</HI> all neighbors to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and on the other &s;ide a part of the riuer of <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> which pa&s;&s;ing by the country of the <HI>Eburones</HI> and the moderne <HI>Geldrois,</HI> comes &amp; ioynes with the riuer of <HI>Wahal</HI> (which is a branche of the <HI>Rhine)</HI> nere vnto <HI>Loue&s;tein,</HI> and then retayning the &s;ole name of <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> wa&s;hing the townes of <HI>Dor|drecht, Rotterdam, Schiedam, Vlaerdingen</HI> and the <HI>Brill,</HI> it falls into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ea, and &s;o into the great Ocean.

ridiculous vnto me, as it is &s;et downe in the chro|nicle of <HI>Holland:</HI> I would rather hold with them which maintaine that the whole countrie hath taken his name of <HI>Gelduba,</HI> a towne in old time &s;eated vpon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> wherof <HI>Tacitus</HI> makes ho|norable mention, but at this day there remaines no memory thereof: <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> holds it for mo&s;t certaine, that the fir&s;t Lords of this country (who long after carried no higher title then of Aduocates, then of Earles, and in the end of Dukes) were two brethre~, i&s;&s;ued from the French <HI>Wyncard</HI> and <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">old du Pont,</HI> who built a Ca&s;tell called <HI>Pont-Gelder,</HI> which ca&s;tle hath long retai|ned that name of Pont, and is now ioyned to the towne of <HI>Geldre,</HI> which hath giuen the name to the whole Prouince, hauing at this day towards the North the countrie of <HI>Fri&s;land,</HI> to the Nor|we&s;t the <HI>Zuyderzee:</HI> vpon the South the riuer of <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> ioynes vpon it, and diuides it from the Duchie of <HI>Brabant:</HI> to the South-ea&s;t is the Du|chie of <HI>Iuilllers.</HI> Towards the Ea&s;t is a part of the riuer of <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the duchie of <HI>Cleues,</HI> the which diuides it into two very vnequall parts: &amp; to the We&s;t is <HI>Holland</HI> and the &s;iegneurie of <HI>Vtrecht.</HI></P>
<P>This Prouince is plaine and of a goodly &s;citu|ation, hauing few mountaines, but maine heaths, &amp; great &s;tore of woods, which are both plea&s;ant and profitable: among the which is that of <HI>Ech|terwald.</HI> All their &s;oile or ground for tillage is ve|ry fertile in corne: and the pa&s;ture fat for cattle,

It hath one very great Church with a high &s;teeple &s;upported with great columnes or pillars, and much longer then any other in the Low-countries. There pa&s;&s;eth now through it a riuer called Sparre, which falls out of a lake of fre&s;h water into the chanell that runnes towards the townes of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Leyden,</HI> which is called the &s;ea of <HI>Harlem;</HI> which riuer hath bene drawne with great labour and charge from that of <HI>Tye</HI> by the &s;luces of <HI>Spa|rendam,</HI> about halfe a league from thence: before the towne on that &s;ide towards <HI>Leyden</HI> there was heretofore a very plea&s;ant wood which during the &s;eege of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was cut downe by the <HI>Allamaines</HI> that were quartred on that &s;ide in the village of <HI>Hemsted;</HI> But within a few yeares after the Magi&s;trate of the towne cau&s;ed it to be replanted, &s;o as in a &s;hort time it became as plea|&s;ant as it was before, &s;eruing the inhabitants of the towne for delightfull walkes for the excer&s;i&s;e of their &s;pirits, and keeping many people of the towne from the Tauernes and &s;uch other places, in pa&s;&s;ing their time there.

Seeing wee are &s;peaking of this ca&s;tle, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e (although it be &s;et downe in the hi&s;tory of the Netherlands) to re|late a memorable accident that then hapned, as a &s;trange&punc; note of true coniugall loue.

<PB N="234" REF="122">
<HI>Schyeringers,</HI> which are butchers and &s;ellers of tripes, which is a ba&s;e kinde of trade, which facti|ons they &s;ay came from Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Fri&s;land.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;pring and beginning thereof was; that all the&s;e marchants of cattell and the butchers bee|ing togither at a publick banket according to their cu&s;tome, there was a gue&s;t to choo&s;e a Prouo&s;t, a Deane or a King among&s;t them, who&s;e charge &s;hould bee to looke that no di&s;order &s;hould bee committed, which might trouble the companie. There was among&s;t them of either of the&s;e two companies, one that exceeded the re&s;t, and both e|quall in wealth, in re&s;pect and loue towards all the gue&s;ts. Whom both the one and the other partie contended to cho&s;e, their Deane, Prouo&s;t or King: the one and the other maintayning that this digni|ty &amp; authority at the table, was mo&s;t befitting him that had the hone&s;te&s;t trade. Wherevpon a que&s;ti|on grew among them, which of tho&s;e two marchan|di&s;e was the hone&s;te&s;t: the one preferring the mar|chants of cattell, the other the butchers. Vpon which di&s;pute their braines being het with wine, in the end they fell from words to blowes one again&s;t an other, party again&s;t party, euery one with his Al|lies and Kin&s;men, meaning to maintaine the one quarrell or the other: &s;o as in the end there was a great fight, in the which many were either hurt or &s;laine. In reuenge whereof, either party holding it &s;elfe wronged, they began to make factions, and to bandie one again&s;t an other: &s;o as this canker eat|ing

more and more; &s;trangers (who had no intere&s;t, nor were any way wronged) ingaged them&s;elues, vpon hope of bootie of the one or the other par|tie: euerie one wre&s;ting what hee could from his Aduer&s;arie, without either lawe or iu&s;tice (&s;o confu&s;ed were things then and full of di&s;order) but &s;uch as they made by the &s;worde, where as the &s;tronge&s;t carried it. The fruits of the&s;e facti|ons were &s;uch, as they not onely rained among&s;t priuate per&s;ons, but among&s;t whole fam lies, vil|lages, bourrougs and townes, yea among whole Prouinces, &s;o as the whole country was ful of thefts and murthers, and no man was free from their in|&s;olencies. In like maner about that time <HI>Holla~d</HI> was afflicted with the factions of <HI>Hoecks</HI> and <HI>Cabillaux</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Hame&s;ons</HI> and the <HI>Merlus,</HI> wherof we haue made mentio~ heretofore: which was, that the one party (as the <HI>Merlus</HI> or <HI>Coddes</HI> bee fi&s;hes which prey) did threaten to deuower the other: and they of the <HI>Hame&s;ons</HI> did threaten to take the others by the throat: which to &s;peake truth were quarrels &s;carce fit for children.

<P>THis fort was built at one in&s;tant with that of <HI>Lilloo,</HI> beeing oppo&s;ite vnto it vpon the riuer of <HI>E&s;cault,</HI> &s;o as all &s;hip s that come from the &s;ea to goe to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e betwixt the&s;e two forts: But it could not re&s;i&s;t the enemies attempts like vnto <HI>Lilloo:</HI> for in the yeare 1584. the Vicont of <HI>Gant</HI> Marquis of <HI>Roubay</HI> be&s;ieged it, and tooke it by a&s;|&s;ault, by a &s;tratageme which he made with a heape of &s;trawe and haie, which he cau&s;ed to bee burnt on the dicke-&s;ide where hee gaue the a&s;&s;ault, &s;o as the &s;moake being driuen with the winde, did &s;o trouble their &s;ights that defended the breach, as they were forced with great furie, the Vicont killing Collonel <HI>Petain,</HI> (who commanded there) with his owne hand, in cold bloud, and cau&s;ing many Burgers of <HI>Antwerp</HI> to bee hanged: the which was afterwards reuenged vpon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other pri&s;oners which they held in the vnited Prouinces. It was &s;ince recouered by the E&s;tates&punc; vnder who&s;e obedi|ence it hath continued vnto this day. Yet it is not like to continue as <HI>Lilloo,</HI> but may well be razed vp|on the conclu&s;ion of a peace, beeing of no &s;uch im|portance as the other.</P>

<P>Is a good village of that quarter of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which hath a Baylife, Alderman and other officers, whereas the vnited E&s;tates did long &s;ince build a fort, and entertained a good garri&s;on: it is &s;ituated in the mide&s;t of a drowned Land, and therefore not ea&s;ie to approch nor to campe before it; for which con&s;ideration the <HI>Spaniard</HI> (who will not willingly wet his feet) would not attempt it: remaining vnto this day vnder the E&s;tates, being commanded by a captaine, &s;uperintendent for them.</P>

<P>IS a little towne in the land of <HI>Waes</HI> (which is one of the be&s;t quarters of <HI>Flanders)</HI> which <HI>Seruaes van Steelandt</HI> great Bayliffe of the &s;aid country of <HI>Waes</HI> deliuered vnto the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> when as the Duke of <HI>Aniou</HI> was retired, after that great folly committed at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> Six or &s;eauen years after Sir <HI>Phillip Sid|ney</HI> Gouernor of <HI>Fle&s;singue,</HI> and <HI>Collonel Ihon Peron</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed it, and deliuered it vnto the E&s;tates in the yeare, 1587. the which they much fortefied &s;ince, by drowning of the great part of the country, which makes it inacce&s;&s;ible, whereof the &s;aid <HI>Peron</HI> hath recouered a good part, during the time that the E|&s;tates, left him gouernor of the place.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BOERENTANGHE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a goodly fort, none of the greate&s;t, but at this pre&s;ent like a little towne vpon the fronters of the countie of <HI>Lingen,</HI> which is the high-way to goe out of <HI>Fri&s;eland</HI> and <HI>Groning</HI> into the country of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> and by <HI>Cloppenbourg</HI> to <HI>Delmenhor&s;t</HI> and <HI>Breme,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Hamburg, Lubecke</HI> and other towns of the Ea&s;t country, along the Baltique &s;ea. Is is en|tertained with a good ordinary garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of many halfe companies (at the lea&s;t when I was there) wherby (in my opinion) the E&s;tates did wi&s;ely cutting off many Monopolies and occa&s;ions of mu|tynies, for that there is &s;eldome any accord where there is diuer&s;itie. The countrie about is all moor|i&s;h or full of turfes, wherewith they doe both fur|ni&s;h the place and the countrie about it.</P>

<P>IS a good village or rather a Borrough, at the end of the <HI>Dullard&punc;</HI> where as the riuer of <HI>Ems</HI> growes narrowe&s;t, by the which they mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e comming from <HI>Embden</HI> by water to goe to <HI>Boerentanghe,</HI> lea|uing the ca&s;tle of <HI>Wedde</HI> vpon the right hand: where the E&s;tates haue made a fort to defend the county

of <HI>Lingen:</HI> yet is it not &s;o well fortefied, but it mu&s;t yeeld to the fir&s;t enemy if he be Mai&s;ter of the field.</P>
<P>As for the other forts di&s;per&s;ed here and there|vpon riuers, fronters and pa&s;&s;ages, beeing many in number, throughout all the vnited Prouinces, I haue thought it &s;uperfluous to de&s;cribe them here particularly, hauing onely vndertaken the chiefe.</P>
<P>By this de&s;cription may be &s;eene, that in the &s;aid eight vnited Prouinces, which make the E&s;tates of the <HI>Belgike</HI> Common-weale, there are aboue &s;ixe|&s;core townes&punc; great and &s;mall, and aboue a hundred ca&s;tles and forts of all &s;orts, entertained with ordi|narie garri&s;ons, be&s;ides their troupes of re&s;erue which they put into townes, e&s;peciallie in winter, or when they haue neede to refre&s;h their compa|nies either of foote or hor&s;e, where they are well lodged and accommodated.</P>
<P>Touching the &s;hippes of warre which the vnited E&s;tates doe v&s;ually entertaine, as well at &s;ea, as vp|on the riuers of <HI>Rhine, Meu&s;e, Wahal, Ems</HI> and o|thers, I cannot &s;et downe the number, the which is great, &s;ome-times more, &s;ome-times le&s;&s;e, accord|ing to the nece&s;&s;itie of their affaires: they haue &s;ome-times a hundred and twenty &s;hippes of warre in paie, well armed and appointed with men and munition. Their nauigation and trafficke of mar|chandi&s;e extends to the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North and South. I dare boldly &s;aie, that the Common-weale of <HI>Venice,</HI> which is held &s;o ritch and mighty an E|&s;tate, could not haue continued &s;uch inte&s;tine wars
<PB REF="156">
three years, as they haue done many, and doyet like the ebbing and flowing of the &s;ea, whom all the forces of <HI>Spaine</HI> could neuer vanqui&s;h.</P>
<P>Wherefore wee mu&s;t conclude that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> was ill adui&s;ed to intreate them with &s;uch rigor, as they haue beene forced to oppo&s;e them|&s;elues and to &s;hake off his yoake. Whereas contra|ry-wi&s;e, the King his &s;onne now raigning, (for feare of &s;ome greater inconuenience) hath with good ad|uice, declared them free E&s;tates, &s;eeing that his fa|ther could not with all his forces and trea&s;ure, de|priue them of their liberties and freedomes: of|fring then peace, without attending the preiudici|all euent of a warre of a hundred yeares: as the Princes of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> his Predece&s;&s;ors had again&s;t the Cantons of <HI>Sui&s;&s;es,</HI> who almo&s;t for the like occa&s;i|ons, did &s;hake off their yoake, neere three hundred yeares &s;ince. Let vs praie vnto God, that their vni|on may continue: the which may re&s;traine the in&s;olency of &s;ome of their Neighbours and norri&s;h peace among them. Which God grant.</P>
