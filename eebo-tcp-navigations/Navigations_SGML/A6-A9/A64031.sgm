<HEAD>A TRUE RELATION Of &s;undry pa&s;&s;ages in and about the mo&s;t honourable Hou&s;e of PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>_ON Munday the third of this in&s;tant month of <HI>January,</HI> his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> by War|rant under his own hand, Authorized Sergeant <HI>Frances,</HI> Sergeant at Armes, to come to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and there to demand Mr. <HI>Denzill Hollis,</HI> Sir <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerigg,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pym,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hampden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Strowd,</HI> whom in his <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> name, he accu&s;ed of High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons returned this an&s;were, that not only tho&s;e five Gentlemen, but al&s;o every one of them would lay downe their lives and for|tunes at his <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> feet, &s;o he would be but plea|&s;ed to accu&s;e them in a legall way, and make known the cau&s;e of their Accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>The next day being Tue&s;day, his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> (unex|pectedly) came to the Hou&s;e of Commons attended with a multitude of per&s;ons Armed as afore&s;aid, and there in the SPEAKERS Chaire, demanded the&s;e five Per&s;ons, &s;aying he expected ye&s;terday o|bedience,
<PB N="2" REF="2">and not an An&s;were: When his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> a long time together had ca&s;t his eyes round about the Hou&s;e, and could not di&s;cerne any of the&s;e five Members there, he was plea&s;ed to command Mr. Speaker to tell him if they were there, the Speaker falling upon his knees humbly be&s;eeching his <HI>Maje|&s;ty</HI> to excu&s;e him, for he was &s;ervant to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and could neither &s;ee nor &s;peake with|out their leave.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;tie di&s;cerning they were not in the Hou&s;e, graciou&s;ly departed; but the bloody min|ded &s;ouldiers, &s;ome of whom &s;tood neere the doore of the Hou&s;e of Commons, with their Pi&s;tols readie cockt, and their Swords erected in their hands, expecting when the word &s;hould have beene given with fearefull Oathes expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, that they lo&s;t that they came for, the per&s;ons were not there, they mi&s;t the opportunity of cutting their throats, and the throats of all tho&s;e Parlia|ment men of the Hou&s;e of Commons that would not have &s;uffered the&s;e five per&s;ons to have beene taken out of the Hou&s;e, his Maje&s;ties owne &s;er|vants carrying them&s;elves civilly, and indeed igno|rant of the Trayterous de&s;igne.</P>
<P>As &s;oone as the&s;e damme blades about the num|ber of 400. were gone, the Hou&s;e of Commons, full of griefe of heart to &s;ee the priviledges of Parlia|ment thus broken, adjourned in great di&s;content til Wedne&s;day, the 5. of Januarie, at two of the clock, at which time they met, and concluded of an Order to adjourne the Hou&s;e till Tu&s;eday, the 11. of Janu|ary, 1641. And in the meane time, appointed a Comittee of the Hou&s;e of Commons to &s;it in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">to con&s;ider of the &s;afety of the King, Kingdome and Parliament, and of repairing of the priviledges of <HI>Parliament</HI> &s;o highly broken.</P>
<P>Which meeting hath produced &s;everall Orders and Declarations for maintaining the priviledges of Parliament, which are to be reported to the Hou&s;e, and there to have it's force.</P>
<P>But for the &s;afety of the Kingdome and Citie, which they conceived to be in emminent danger; the Committee for Iri&s;h affaires of the Hou&s;e of Commons propounded the con&s;ideration thereof to the Committee of the Lords Hou&s;e for Iri&s;h af|faires, who &s;ate likewi&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> who in re|gard the King had denyed both hou&s;es a Guard to protect them; and in regard &s;uch an ho&s;till plot was intended, as was apparantly proved declared their opinion, that whereas the King and Parliament was in &s;o great danger; that in that ca&s;e the Sheriffes of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Midle&s;ex,</HI> ought to come with the <HI>Po&s;&s;e Commitatus,</HI> to the Parliament to de|fend the King and Parliament, to which opinion the Comittee of the Hou&s;e of Commons a&s;&s;ented, which was communicated to the Lord Major, Al|dermen and Common Coun&s;ell of <HI>London,</HI> and they delivered their opinions herein, and expre&s;&s;ed their forwardne&s;&s;e hereunto.</P>
<P>This breach of priviledge of Parliament begot much di&s;content in the Parliament and people, and the more in regard by &s;peciall command, the Arti|cles again&s;t Ma&s;ter <HI>Pym,</HI> and the re&s;t was printed, and the &s;ame publi&s;hed by Sir <HI>William Killegrue</HI> and Sir <HI>William Flemyn,</HI> and delivered in his Maje&s;ties Name (as they fa&s;ely pretended) to the foure Innes
<PB N="4" REF="3">of Court, to the end to make the&s;e per&s;ons the more odious to them and the Kingdome: And in regard the con&s;equence of admitting this Accu&s;ation in this manner again&s;t the&s;e five per&s;ons, is a pre&s;ident to take away the whole Hou&s;e of Commons at a breath, under pretence of high Trea&s;on, if (as God forbid) an Accun&s;ation of this nature &s;hould be hereafter; and con&s;idering that to this very day, (11. Januar. 1641.) no Articles of Impeachment is come into the Hou&s;e of Commons by the Kings Attourney or otherwi&s;e, or from the Lords Hou&s;e (if any be there again&s;t them) till which time that it come from thence by me&s;&s;engers of their owne (if their fir&s;t depending) the Hou&s;e cannot legally take notice thereof: This, and ma|ny other rea&s;ons, made the Hou&s;e of Commons to in&s;i&s;t upon it, be&s;ides the great merit of the&s;e per|&s;ons, whom (as the hou&s;e hath declared) though as deare as their lives unto them, they will deliver over unto a tryall, &s;o as his Maje&s;tie will proceed again&s;t them in a legall way, either at the Kings Bench, or in Parliament, and produce any Subject in England that will &s;tand to make good the Accu|&s;ation, and in ca&s;e they faile to make it good, that his Majectie will let them be forth-comming, and al&s;o to di&s;cover tho&s;e wicked Coun&s;ells that have advi&s;ed him to this cour&s;e, that they may be brought to condigne puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The City ond people in the adjacent parts are &s;o much moved in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and fearing &s;ome &s;ud|daine execution may be done upon the <HI>Parliament</HI> (both the Hou&s;e of Peeres, and Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Lords of the Privy Coun&s;ell, having decla|red
<PB N="5" REF="4">that this Act of his <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> without their ad|vice, and again&s;t the privilledges of <HI>Parliament</HI>) That they ye&s;terday declared, that eight Compa|nies of the Trayned Bands, with 8. pieces of Ord|nance, and divers Hor&s;emen mounted, &s;hall Guard the Commitees of the Hou&s;e of Peeres, and Com|mons, from Grocers-hall in <HI>London</HI> to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> And the Sea Captaines, Ma&s;ters of Ships, and Mar|riners, with &s;mall Barges, and long Boates &s;uffici|ently man'd and Armed with Murderers, Rablets, Faulchion and Minion, with Mu&s;quets and halfe-Pikes, to the number of 2000 per&s;ons have engaged them&s;elves to Guard the Parliament by water. The Trayned Bands in <HI>Southwark</HI> have offered them|&s;elves to &s;ecure all the other &s;ide of the water, and the Aprentices tendred their &s;ervices to attend the Parliament to the number of ten thou&s;and with Warlike weapons, but tho&s;e the Parliament en|joyned to &s;tay at home. And la&s;tly, the Watermen tendred their Barges for more &s;afety to carry the Parliament men by Water: All which to the great admiration of all the Beholders, put in execution this day: And that which is mo&s;t con&s;iderable, 4000 Hor&s;emen are come to the hou&s;e of Co~mons this day, except &s;ome of them which lay at <HI>Vxbridg</HI> and places thereabouts, with a Petition in the name of the whole County of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> that <HI>Mr. Hampden</HI> their Knight of the Shire may receive his Tryall, and not lie under the name of high Trea&s;on, and cannot obtaine a legall way of Tryall, and that if he acquit him&s;elfe (as no good men make doubt of) Ju&s;tice in a high mea&s;ure may be done upon the fal&s;e informers of his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> how neere or how
<PB REF="4">a great &s;oever; They being confident that it is but de|&s;igne of the Popi&s;h party, to put an interruption in the proceedings of Parliament, that no reliefe may be &s;ent to <HI>Ireland,</HI> but that more Prote&s;tant blood may be &s;hed there, and that all Acts made this Parliament, may be avoyded under pretence of no free Parliament: And la&s;tly to force a breach of this Parliament, by an un|timely adjournment, or fayle of meeting through fear of danger.</P>
