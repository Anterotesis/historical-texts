<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 13. of this in&s;tant (after a tempe&s;tuous &s;torm) it plea&s;ed God to admit us a fair Gale, and a &s;ea&s;onable calm, untill &s;uch time that we had coa&s;ted neer the point of <HI>Gibralterre,</HI> where we made a di&s;covery of the re&s;t of our Fleet under the Con|duct of Vice-Admirall <HI>Pen;</HI> and coming up to them, our Captain was called aboard the <HI>Fairfax</HI> Frigat, where a Councel of Officers were pre&s;ent; and after &s;ome &s;erious con&s;ultation touchin the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> Fleet in the
<PB N="4" REF="3"><HI>Streights,</HI> unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to &s;teer towards that coa&s;t, and fight them; and accordingly on the 14 in&s;tant, we weighed anchor, and after 9 hours &s;ayl came within &s;ight of them; which they perceiving, immediatly prepared to re|ceive Us, opening their port-holes, put forth their Guns, and man'd their Decks; for indeed they were at lea&s;t three to one; being about 33 Sayl, and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e Bankers which were the onely Pyrats that had mo&s;t an|noy'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch:</HI> Our Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of but nine &s;ayl, but very re&s;olved men; as appears by the en&s;u|ing Narrative, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>When we came within a league of their Rear. Admirall, Orders were given for each man to make ready to man the Decks, the Gunners and their A&s;&s;i&s;tants to prepare and o|pen their port-holes; and &s;o each man according to his place and calling, to endeavour what in him lay to perform that duty and &s;ervice which God had called him unto: This was with great care and prudence ob&s;erved; and immedi|atly the Red Flag in every &s;hip was put forth; which be|ing done, the Trumpets &s;ounded, the Marriners &s;houted, and &s;oon after the Canons plaid; for when we came within half a league of them, about 13 of their be&s;t &s;hips were manned forth, who gave us &s;everal broad &s;ides; which Captain <HI>Pen</HI> perceiving, immediatly made up to them with the <HI>Fairfax,</HI> the <HI>Lyon,</HI> the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> and the <HI>George,</HI> and gave them eight broad &s;ides; in&s;omuch that the Enemy decli|ned engagement, and would fain have de&s;erted us; but C. <HI>Pen</HI> keeping clo&s;e up with them to the re&s;t of their &s;hips, the whole Fleets became engaged; and a bloudy fight en|&s;ued, which continued for the &s;pace of two hours, and very gallantly maintained on both &s;ides: For the <HI>Lyon</HI> laid the <HI>French</HI> Admiral aboard three times, and was &s;till repul&s;ed and beaten off; but the fourth time &s;he carryed it, and
<PB N="5" REF="3">hailing her clo&s;e, entred the &s;hip, and put mo&s;t of the men to the &s;word, for they denied quarter. During this di&s;pute, the valiant <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and the re&s;t of our Fleet, plyed them clo&s;e with great and &s;mall &s;hot, and killed many of them, e&s;pecially the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who lay the mo&s;t open to out &s;hot, for they charged their Canon on the out-&s;ide of their &s;hips: In this conflict we &s;unk 7, and boarded five more; and at la&s;t di&s;pier&s;ed the whole Navy, taking about 15 &s;ayl of them; &s;o that there are not many got off, but &s;ome few <HI>Pickroons,</HI> which were too &s;wift for us; but I am confident, they cannot be very &s;erviceable; for the &s;hips that we have taken are exceedingly torn, and mo&s;t of the men either kil|led or wounded; &s;o re&s;olutely did they fight it out. And truly I may &s;ay, that &s;uch a mercy never did God be&s;tow upon his poor &s;ervants at Sea, as he hath done upon Us, in giving of Us Victory over our Enemies, and making Us in|&s;trumental for the vanqui&s;hing &s;uch a formidable pyrati|cal power as the&s;e were, with &s;o little lo&s;&s;e; for from the beginning to the ending, we lo&s;t not above 20 men, &s;ome few wounded, and our &s;hips not much defaced or torn: God grant that we may live to prai&s;e &amp; glorifie the Name of the Lord for this happy deliverance: And likewi&s;e for the many and wonderful deliverances which He hath di&s;|pen&s;ed to his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Two Dutch men of War came in to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance about the middle of the fight; but its conjectur'd, that it was more for their own ends, then for any love they bare to us: however, I &s;hall cen&s;ure charitably; for we have lo&s;t no|thing, but they haue gain'd; having by this means inlarg'd their liberty upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts.</P>

We had no intelligence of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s at <HI>Waterford,</HI> until 4. a Clock on the Lords day, but upon no|tice thereof we made out with all the Boats and Ve&s;&s;els we could procure, and fell down that night within a mile of the Town, and about 10. or 11. a Clock at night the Enemy quitted the place and marched away, having agreed with the Town&s;men to pay them 400 l. to &s;ave the Town from burning. Since which time we have received intelligence that Col. <HI>Cook,</HI> and Col. <HI>Axtel,</HI> with Col. <HI>Prette,</HI> have given the &s;ame Enemy a repul&s;e, comming upon them in the County of <HI>Kildare,</HI> fell upon their reare as they were going o|ver a pa&s;&s;e, put them to the run, pur&s;uing them 4. or 5. miles, about
