<HEAD>A brief Relation or Remon&s;trance of the Injurious Proceedings and Inhumane cruelties of the Turks, perpetrated on the Commander and company of the Ship <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> with the re|&s;olved Captivity of their Ship, Goods and Per&s;ons, by the Men of War of <HI>Tripoli</HI> and <HI>Tunis;</HI> with their happy e&s;cape from them. <ADD>7^b^e^r 8 1657</ADD></HEAD>
<P><HI>_WIlliam Ell,</HI> Commander of the Ship <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> with his &s;aid &s;hip at <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> about the twelfth of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t was pre&s;&s;ed by the Ba&s;&s;a of the &s;aid place, to &s;erve for tran&s;portation of Rice, Sugars, with other provi&s;ions for the Grand Signiers ac|count, from the &s;aid Port of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> or <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which of the two (might with mo&s;t conveniency and &s;ecurity from the <HI>Venetian</HI> Armata) be fir&s;t arrived to, with contract for the &s;umme of Rials of 8/8 6550. for &s;uch goods
<PB N="2" REF="2">as the Turks &s;aid they would lade; and for the re&s;t of his &s;hips burden, he was to lade him&s;elf or di&s;po&s;e of as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Captain and &s;hip thus forced and ingaged, the Turks (contrary to the &s;aid contract) keep them from the 12 of <HI>January</HI> till the 18 of <HI>April,</HI> (with promi&s;e of con&s;ideration for demurrage or lo&s;s of time) they detaining him onely for their own convenience. At la&s;t di&s;mi&s;s him (with breach of contract too) both in quantity and quality of the goods promi|&s;ed to be laden) without payment of any part of his fraight, or the lea&s;t allowance for his &s;o long attendance.</P>
<P>The Captain thereupon demanding compliance, with con|tract for fraight and demurrage, is an&s;wered with threats of chains and captivity, if he forthwith depart not with two French &s;hips, which they had in like manner forced to &s;erve for Convoy of divers Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els which were ready to de|part with us, putting on board of us (among&s;t other Turks) an Officer called <HI>Capagee</HI> to order us (as it &s;hould &s;eem) ac|cording to In&s;tructions given him, whereof we know nothing, &s;ave to &s;ail directly to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> or <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;aid Turki&s;h Officer or Capagee (&s;o &s;oon as we were gotten into the height of the I&s;land of <HI>Rhodes</HI>) commanded us in the Grand Seigniers name, of bear in for that Port (when we had a fair wind to &s;ail on towards <HI>Smyrna</HI>) and the 28 of <HI>April</HI> we came into <HI>Rhodes</HI> with all our Fleet, &s;ave the bigger of the French &s;hips, which left us two dayes before; nor could we hear what became of him.</P>
<P>In the Port of <HI>Rhodes</HI> we found the Captain Ba&s;&s;a (or Ge|neral or the Grand Signiers Naval forces) with fourty four Gallyes, &s;even <HI>Tripoli,</HI> &s;ix <HI>Algetre,</HI> four <HI>Tunis</HI> &s;hips of War; here we are con&s;igned into the Ba&s;&s;a's hands, and kept two moneths in wor&s;e condition (for blows of all &s;orts, with wea|pons and other wayes) then the very Gally-Slaves, and were reduces to want to all provi&s;ions, &s;ave bread onely, without money to help our &s;elves; nor dur&s;t we go on &s;hore to procure it. And be&s;ides all our per&s;onal &s;ufferings (and making us row them with our boats where any of them plea&s;ed for the pay of blows and abu&s;es) we were threatned by tho&s;e of <HI>Tripoli</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> that &s;o &s;oon as the Grand Signiers goods were out of
<PB N="3" REF="2">our &s;hip, they would not onely have two youths of ours (which they had &s;aid wait for, to &s;atisfie their inhumane, unnaturall Lu&s;t) but al&s;o would be Ma&s;ter of our &s;hip, goods and men, or they would &s;et fire of us, though it were in Port; nor were tho&s;e words onely loo&s;ely &s;poken as &s;imply bravado's, but re&s;olutions confirmed to us by &s;ome Jews pa&s;&s;engers with us, who conver|&s;ing with them on &s;hore, adverti&s;ed our Captain of the &s;ame; advi&s;ing him to provide for the &s;ecurity of his &s;hip, per&s;on, and goods.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all which, and our &s;hips being &s;o leek (by rea&s;on of a &s;troke on a wrack as we came out of <HI>Alexandria</HI>) that our pumps went continually, we yet &s;ailed after the Ba&s;&s;a and his Fleet to the I&s;land of <HI>Stangue,</HI> where they then told us we mu&s;t go to <HI>Mettelina</HI> (an I&s;land 'twixt <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI>) there to deliver all our goods, as well belong|ing to &s;trangers as to our &s;elves, and fit our &s;hip to &s;erve among&s;t them again&s;t the <HI>Venetians:</HI> to which an&s;wer was made that the Captain was under obligation to &s;everal Mer|chants to carry their goods to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> that his &s;hip (as they &s;aw) was leek and un&s;erviceable, wherefore he de&s;ired he might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> left the &s;hip might founder under him, and all be loft. But no rea&s;on will &s;erve, follow them we mu&s;t, whither they plea&s;e to lead us, till a fit conjuncture to make us a prey to the Barbarians, whom the Ba&s;&s;a is forced to humour, fearing their power, and want|ing their aid, in this &s;o great exigent again&s;t the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the French Captain and the Mariners of each our &s;hips had certain notice of the de&s;ign which the <HI>Tripoli</HI> and <HI>Tunis</HI> men of war had on us both, and came to our Captain to give account of what they were too much a&s;&s;ured, and wi&s;hed him (as they intended to do) to provide for the pre&s;ervation of him&s;elf, his people and goods.</P>
<P>In this great &s;trait, not having much time to con&s;ider, nor others to con&s;ult then our own abu&s;ed Officers and Mari|ners, (all &s;truck with deep apprehen&s;ion of our greater approch|ing mi&s;eries) after craving Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direction, the Captain re&s;olves all difficulties and expedients: And fir&s;t,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he had left a con&s;iderable part of his &s;tock at <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3">with all the freight (or pay) due to him for the pre&s;ent &s;er|vice vice to the value of Rials 8/8 20000 or thereabouts, to provide lading for his &s;hip again&s;t his return from <HI>Smyrna</HI> thither, and that he had in his &s;hip the value of other Rials 8/8 25000. or thereabouts (for his own and owners account) in goods no where vendable &s;ave in Turkey (or at be&s;t of little value in any part of Chri&s;tendome) and therefore he not going into Turky, would be the certain lo&s;s of all the <HI>Alexandria</HI> &s;tock, with a very great part of that in the &s;hip.</P>
<P N="2">2. That if he &s;hould e&s;cape from the Fleet and go for <HI>Smyrna</HI> (whither 'twas probable his now mutinied Marriners were like&s;t to be per&s;waded to go) That then for di&s;obeying the Generals command of going to <HI>Metelina,</HI> (and under pre|tence of the Grand Signieurs di&s;-&s;ervice) the General might make life and goods a prey to his fury and avarice.</P>
<P N="3">3. That if he &s;hould go with them to <HI>Metelina,</HI> and un|lade all there, our goods would be imbezelled and lo&s;t, we ha|ving none there to take care of any thing, nor any one of lan|guage to &s;peak for us, if we &s;hould be kept among&s;t them to &s;erve again&s;t the Venetians, and by accident &s;hould be taken by them, there could be no better expected then lo&s;s of &s;hip, and captivity of per&s;ons; as it befell Captain <HI>Mer&s;ie</HI> in the &s;hip <HI>Peter,</HI> about two years &s;ince.</P>
<P N="4">4. That a French Captain which went away from <HI>Alex|andria</HI> about four dayes before us, be&s;ides lo&s;s of all was taken and hanged by the Venetian General, onely for bringing pro|vi&s;ions to the Turks, and hereof we had notice at <HI>Rhodes.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That again&s;t this de&s;perate de&s;tructive re&s;olution of the Barbarian Cor&s;ares to make prize of his, our per&s;ons and goods, we could have little hope of protection from the Ca|ptain Ba&s;&s;a or General, for that five dayes before we arri|ved at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> the &s;aid &s;even &s;hips of <HI>Tripoli</HI> (which were then in the Grand Seignieurs &s;ervice, and had received their pay before they came out of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> which notwith&s;tanding) did near <HI>Candia</HI> &s;eize on the &s;hip <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>Thomas</HI> on his way towards <HI>Scandarone,</HI> with the value of Rials of 8/8 100000 in ready money and goods for the account of our Merchants, and made &s;ale of our &s;hip, per&s;ons and goods at
<PB N="5" REF="3"><HI>Rhodes,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the Grand Seignieur and Armate, which ought to have protected our &s;hip, men and goods, and relea&s;ed all according to our Capitulations, had the <HI>Tripoli</HI> &s;hip been &s;imply in the capacity of Barbarian Rovers, and much more being in the Grand Seignieurs pay, and con&s;equent|ly of is own Navy.</P>
<P>The whole premi&s;&s;es con&s;idered, with the a&s;&s;urances (the French Captain and Officers affirmed they had from very good hands of the inevitable de&s;truction which was de&s;igned for us; together with the general Re&s;olution of our men not to run them&s;elves further into an apparent mi&s;ery which was yet a|voidable; we on the 6 of <HI>July,</HI> near the I&s;le of <HI>Samos,</HI> took our opportunity to leave the Turks in the night; and by Gods ble&s;&s;ing on the 28 of <HI>July</HI> we arrived at <HI>Livorne,</HI> for which great deliverance, the good &amp; provident Lord be for ever ble&s;&s;ed; our Captain and all with him humbly conceived, that God directed them to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian and prudent expedient for the pre|&s;ervation of &s;o many Chri&s;tians, e&s;tates, liberties and lives, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed, with their poor fami|lies depending on them all whom may now by Gods providence live to &s;erve their Countrey.</P>
<P>We are now informed that &s;ome officious per&s;ons here, cla|mour high, condemning this our act, as like to be prejudicial to the e&s;tate in Turkey; and that therefore they would endeavour to procure the great Dukes denial of us the u&s;ual priviledge of his free Port. And that we &s;hall neither have reception nor pro|tection, but would inforce us to return into the Barbarians hands, from which God hath &s;o graciou&s;ly delivered us; but had the perte&s;t of tho&s;e critical pretenders been under the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s, they would que&s;tionle&s;s have con&s;idered with us that life being the mo&s;t de&s;irable of all temporal good <HI>(For skin for skin and all that a man hath he will give for his life)</HI> next liber|ty and e&s;tate, which makes our being a comfortable wel-being; and then the reputation of ju&s;tice and prudence, which are mans chiefe&s;t ornaments and accompli&s;hments, and all the&s;e at brink of inevitable ruine, and but one onely way left to e&s;cape it. It is believed they would have concluded with us that pre&s;ervation of all was prepo&s;eable unto &s;elf-felony, &s;elf-be|traying
<PB N="6" REF="4">of liberty and e&s;tates (with the wel-being of all our deare&s;t relations) in fidelity to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us, by whom imployed us, and forfeiture of the repute of prudent, or able to manage, imputation of all which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been incured, had we not u&s;ed this onely means to &s;ave what el&s;e had been totally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>And for jealou&s;ie of prejudice to the e&s;tate in Turkey. The Tenth Article of our capitulation provides as followeth; <HI>viz.</HI> That no Engli&s;h-mans per&s;on or e&s;tate (except of &s;uch as have become &s;ureties by publick Act) &s;hall be liable to the debt or default of any other, and que&s;tionle&s;s the Lord Emba&s;&s;adour with his power and authority will have better account of Capi|tulations from a Council of State, where things are calmly debated, that all parties may be under&s;tood, then poor men could have had when in the hands of mercile&s;s Barbarians, who had determined our general de&s;truction; be&s;ides the two youths which were committed to our Captains Tuition (for education as well in Chri&s;tianity, as in abilities to be &s;erviceable to their Countrey; he was as willing to pre&s;erve from being forced (by cruelties) to turn Turk, or &s;uffering other un&s;peak|able abu&s;es; As <HI>Lot</HI> was to incur inconveniencies to him&s;elf rather then to expo&s;e his two &s;trangers (once retired under his roof and protection) to the abu&s;e of tho&s;e (and the&s;e are no le&s;s) <HI>Nefarious</HI> Sodomites, who at <HI>Rhodes</HI> violated two Greek youths belonging to the Gallies, for which &s;ome of the &s;oul|diers (who were the in&s;truments of bearing them away) were hanged, but the youths could never be recovered out of the hands of the Barbarian Captain who had them; So little the&s;e Mon&s;ters value the Ba&s;&s;a's authority. But not to be trouble|&s;ome with much more which might be &s;aid: The &s;umme of all is &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, natural and rational, and when that's at &s;take (which &s;uch a train of dependences as attended this ca&s;e of ours) 'Tis humbly conceived, that all other circum&s;tances (nay even legalities them&s;elves) are not con&s;iderable; and if in or|der to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, a <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> ob&s;cured him&s;elf, a <HI>David</HI> feigned madne&s;s &amp; a <HI>Paul</HI> e&s;caped out of a window in a basket; It may be hoped there's nothing in this act of ours contrary to Canon or civil right. And to take of all &s;uppo&s;itions of making
<PB N="7" REF="4">any advantage of the Turks goods, It is de&s;ired that the intere&s;|&s;ed in the &s;hip would become &s;ecurity to his Highne&s;s the Lord Protector, that ju&s;t account &s;hall be rendred of all that belongs to the Turks; and that the ballance due to them &s;hall likewi&s;e be depo&s;ited in the hands of whom&s;oever his Highne&s;s may think fit to appoint to be di&s;po&s;ed accordingly, after the ca&s;e is more fully examined, controverted and judged; for we de&s;ire to give a good account of our &s;elves in all particulars, to enjoy our Countrey and friends, and with our per&s;ons and &s;ub&s;tance to &s;erve his Highne&s;s and the State, as our Captain and many of us in the &s;ame &s;hip did, on the engagement with the Dutch before <HI>Livorne,</HI> under Captain <HI>Badiley,</HI> to the knowledge of all the <HI>Levant</HI> Company, in who&s;e &s;ervice our Captain hath been imployed ever &s;ince his childhood; nor hath any other way of livelihood, &s;ave by the &s;ervice of his friends in the <HI>Levant</HI> Navigation. And therefore humbly de|&s;ires that this Ca&s;e may have gracious audience, and him&s;elf and company acquitted or condemned according to the merit of it.</P>
<P>And in the mean time we further pray, that the intere&s;&s;ed in the &s;hip would become petitioners to his Highne&s;s for his Let|ter to the great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> that we may with the u&s;ual freedom of his Port, buy, &s;ell, and receive our dues without oppre&s;&s;ion or mole&s;tation from any pretenders what&s;oever; That we may not be nece&s;&s;itated to any re&s;olutions unworthy our Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, or our Nation.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, it is humbly de&s;ired, That this our ca&s;e may be repre&s;ented to his Highne&s;s in the &s;ame dre&s;s it comes to you, for &s;imple attire be&s;t becomes &s;o &s;ad a truth, which (with our &s;elves) we with all humility, pro&s;trate at his Highne&s;s feet, with prayers for his length of happy dayes.</P>
