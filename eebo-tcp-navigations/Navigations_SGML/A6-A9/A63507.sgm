<HEAD>A True DESCRIPTION OF JAMAICA, With the Fertility, Commodities, and Healthfulne&s;s of the Place.</HEAD>
<P>_THis I&s;land is &s;cituated We&s;t from <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> South from <HI>Cuba,</HI> which <HI>Columbus</HI> here|tofore called the I&s;le of St. <HI>Iames,</HI> but its now better known by the name of <HI>Ia|maica.</HI> The eighteenth De|gree of Northern Latitude cuts the middle of it. It is of equal di&s;tance from
<PB N="2" REF="3">the two former great I&s;lands, <HI>viz.</HI> twenty Leagues from each. The compa&s;s or circuit of the I&s;land is an hundred and fifty leagues; its length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t is fifty leagues, the bredth is twenty, or better. This I&s;land excels the others for the goodne&s;s both of the Ayr, and bounty of the &s;oyl, it is for the mo&s;t part a plain and even Country, yeilding in great abundance what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;a|ry for mans life. It breeds and nouri&s;hes very great &s;tore of Hor&s;es, Bulls, Cows, and Hogs: The Yucam (whereof Ca&s;&s;avi is made) is &s;o plenteous, as that this I&s;land (and mo&s;t de&s;ervedly) may be reckoned the Granary of the re&s;t of the I&s;lands; Cotton-wool grows very frequently up and down the I&s;land, which makes it to excel mo&s;t in clo|thing; al&s;o whatever fruits God and Nature have planted from the beginning, or have by the indu|&s;try and diligence of man been tran&s;planted thi|ther from any other part, do thrive in this Land wonderfully. The Spaniards, when fir&s;t they ar|rived here, found the I&s;land very well furni&s;hed with barbarous people, which &s;ince are &s;trangely decrea&s;ed; partly through the cruelty of their Lords, partly by rea&s;on of their own &s;loth and idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Towns here (con&s;idering the bravery and goodne&s;s of the I&s;land) are but few in number: at this day not above three, the chief of which is <HI>Sevil,</HI> upon the North &s;ide of the I&s;land, not far from the Sea. Here was an Abbaty, whereof <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> that famous Writer of the Indian
<PB N="3" REF="3">affairs, was &s;omtimes Abbot. The next Town to this, at an eleven Leagues di&s;tance Ea&s;tward, &s;tands <HI>Melilla,</HI> famous for <HI>Columbus</HI> his Shipwrack, when in a tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;age that he had from <HI>Veragua,</HI> he would &s;o gladly have put in thither. The third Town is <HI>Ori&s;tan,</HI> upon the we&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land, fourteen Leagues from Sevil: But of the City <HI>de la Vega,</HI> whence the <HI>Columbi</HI> had the Title of their Dukedom, there is &s;carce at this time any memorial or remembrance.</P>
<P>A great part of this I&s;land, with the chief City of it, was &s;ubdued in the year 1596, by Sir <HI>An|thony Sherley.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea &s;hore, where it mo&s;t vergeth and bend|eth it &s;elf toward the Ea&s;t, hath the high Promon|tory <HI>Moranta</HI> upon it, from which the &s;aid &s;hore goes back by little and little toward the Southwe&s;t, taking in the Sea in certain Creeks, then it goes di|rectly forward toward the We&s;t &s;o far as to the Promontory <HI>de Falcon,</HI> whence it turns to the we&s;t|ward, till it come to the Promontory <HI>del Negrillo,</HI> which lies outmo&s;t to the We&s;t, from thence again the &s;hore turns in towards the Ea&s;t: In the Nor|thern quarter of it, it hath many Stations and Ports, the chief of which lies nigh to <HI>Sevil,</HI> the next to <HI>Melilla,</HI> ten leagues from the former to the Ea&s;tward; the third <HI>Ianta,</HI> a like di&s;tance off, ten leagues from the former, and as many from the Promontory of <HI>Moranta,</HI> towards the we&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this I&s;land for the richne&s;s and good|ne&s;s of the &s;oyl, for the plea&s;antne&s;s of its woods,
<PB N="4" REF="4">and the abundance of all good things, may very well contend with any other of the American I&s;lands whatever, and in this re&s;pect excels them, that it hath &s;o convenient and advantagious a &s;citu|ation between the greater I&s;lands and the We&s;tern Continent of <HI>America:</HI> So as if our Countrymen would but rai&s;e up their dull &s;pirits, and &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et them&s;elves to plant there, they would not only exceedingly advance the Publique Intere&s;t, and be|nefit their Native Country, but very much advan|tage and enrich them&s;elves, their children, and po|&s;terity; there being no Adventure or Merchan|dize in any part of the world undertaken as yet by the Engli&s;h, that is like to be of le&s;s hazard, and more certain profit, as evidently appears, in that he that fir&s;t di&s;covered the&s;e Countries, and be&s;t knew to make his choice, was only a Suitor for this I&s;land; and when afterward he was asked by the Portugal why he did not cau&s;e the mines there to be wrought; he made an&s;wer, They would fir&s;t go farther off, and when they had wrought out tho&s;e, they would return thither, being a place nearer home, and of great &s;ecurity. I need not inform you of the great variety of Fi&s;h, and Fowl, nor the healthfulne&s;s of the place, when a man hath &s;ome little time been acquainted with the Ayr.</P>
<P>And &s;o my Countrymen, wi&s;hing &s;uch noble thoughts to po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;ouls, as may encline you to &s;ome gallant endeavour and undertaking herein, that after times may &s;ay, this active Age hath not con&s;in'd us to one poor corner of the earth, but
<PB N="5" REF="4">&s;tirr'd us up to look upon that which the negli|gence of our Ance&s;tors did cau&s;e them &s;o unhap|pily to fore&s;low and for&s;ake, I recommend you to the direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty.</P>
