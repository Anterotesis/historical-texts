<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Friday la&s;t about five of the clock in the morning, our Generals re&s;olved to fight the enemy; and after &s;eeking the Lord for a ble&s;&s;ing in this great work, we engaged their whole Fleet con|&s;i&s;ting of about 80 &s;ail, who were convoying neer upon 300 Merchants homewards; we were not above 60 &s;ail, yet di&s;puted it till 7 of the clock in the Evening, great execution being done on both &s;ides, as appears by the inclo&s;ed Narrative and Li&s;t. The fable night ending the di&s;pute, both fleets lay neer each other with their Lights forth; and on Sa|turday morning the fight began again, which was with great gallantry maintained by Gen. Blake, with his own Squadron, viz.</P>

<P>All which, bare up to the enemy with &s;o gallant a &s;pirit of re&s;olution, that (by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of General Monk with the Vanguard and others) before 3 of the clock on Friday, we had taken, &s;unk, and fired 15 &s;ail, whereof one is their Vice-Admiral, a &s;tout &s;hip of 60 Guns; another, their Rear-admiral, a gallant &s;hip, and fought bravely; indeed, &s;o they did all; but General Blake having got the wind-ward of them, charged with &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;table and magnanimous &s;pirit, that Vantrump endeavoured to decline en|gagement, which his Excellency perceiving, imme|diatly pur&s;u'd; &s;o that a third and fourth conflict hapned; during which di&s;putes, the famous Triumph (to the perpetual eternizing of the Generals fame be it &s;poken) received neer upon &s;even hundred &s;hots, wherein was &s;lain that noble and approved &s;ouldier capt. Ball, with &s;ome others; be&s;ides many wounded; among&s;t the re&s;t, the General him&s;elf re|ceived a wound upon the Thigh by an unhappy &s;plinter (but its hoped not dangerous) which &s;plin|ter took away part of General Deanes breeches, but
<PB N="5" REF="3"> not any part of his body at the lea&s;t hurt. In this fight Captain Mildmay, and Captain Barker, de|ported thsm&s;elves with &s;ingular dexterity and cou|rage; but at la&s;t received their mortal wounds; to|gether with our Secretary, who&s;e deaths are much lamented. Both our Rear-Admirals have lo&s;t their Main-ma&s;ts, but are got &s;afe into port&s;mouth; we have al&s;o lo&s;t the Samp&s;on, which was &s;o extreamly rent and torn, that &s;he was even almo&s;t full of wa|ter; until which time, the Souldiers and Mariners re&s;olved not to de&s;ert her; but at la&s;t was forced to e&s;eape in boats.</P>
<P>The enemies lo&s;s is far greater; for we have &s;unk fired, and taken about 19, and are now in pur&s;uit of them towards their own Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Their Merchant-men are conceived lay up to|wards the Coa&s;t of France all the time of the En|gagement; and we doubt not but to give a good account of this memorable Expedition very &s;ud|denly. Vice-admiral Pen endeavored to come &s;ea&s;o|nably in to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with 14 &s;ail, from the Downs; but was prevented by cro&s;s windes; yet it plea&s;ed God he came timely to the pur&s;uit. We are now in a gallant condition; &s;ince the Lord was plea&s;ed to crown the endeavors of our Fleet with happy &s;ucce&s;s; for which we de&s;ire to magnifie his great and glorious Name.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe States proceed on vigorou&s;ly in &s;eting forth a new Armado; no le&s;s then eighty &s;ayl is voted for, in ca&s;e they receive not a Repeal from England: &s;ome Frigats are already off from the Stocks, and Dewitte is the onely man whom they now pin their faith upon; but that which renders them indifferent willing, is, their &s;trange Fancies and new Gingles of infu&s;ing an incredible belief into the hearts of the people, viz. That your General Cromwel is confined to the Tower of London, for declaring for the Intere&s;t of young Charles, upon the Parliaments motion to make his brother the Duke of Glouce&s;ter King; &s;aying, That in ca&s;e they mu&s;t have a King, they &s;hould take the right Heir; with many other falaci|ous Devi&s;es, of the Lord Grey's drawing his Sword in the Parliament hou&s;e again&s;t his Excellency, the creating of collonel Harri&s;on General of the &s;oul|diery, and divers other circum&s;tances of the like coyn, which will prove too light for the&s;e Arti&s;ts of
<PB N="7" REF="4"> the Flemi&s;h Mint. Nay, further, they retain &s;uch un|pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">allel'd atchievements of their Victors at &s;ea, that all is like to be their own in England, for&s;ooth; and nothing but Death and Impri&s;onment &s;hall be the Reward and Portion of the Members of Parlia|ment, without either Bail or Mainprize. Again, they plea&s;e them&s;elves very much with thoughts of &s;trange mutinies among our men, both by Land and Sea, and divi&s;ions among&s;t your Governours, and Commanders, whereupon they expect a &s;ud|den change; and it is for certain reported, that Hull, Yarmouth, and the Divel and all, are revolted to the Royal party. And yet all this will not get in the In|tere&s;t of Monarchy, though that party do pretend mountains of golden advantages thereby for the ta|ming of the Engli&s;h: All that they do for him as yet, is, to give him free Port for &s;uch &s;hips as &s;hall by his commi&s;&s;ion &s;ail. But now that the Zealand Lords are arrived here, &s;omewhat more will be attempted, not onely for him, but al&s;o in the behalf of the O|range Family. The Duke of Glouce&s;ter, with a very &s;mall Retinue, is tran&s;ported from the I&s;le of Wight into Flanders; from whence comes a mon&s;trous ru|mour of a great Victory obtained by the Dutch; but where, no man knowes.</P>
