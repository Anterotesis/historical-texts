<HEAD>Critical REMARKS Upon the ADVENTURES OF <HI>Telemachus.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN truth, Sir, you are a dangerous Enemy; 'tis neither fair nor civil to take &s;o much Advantage of the Power ye have over me. I have my Rea&s;ons for my Silence; why &s;hould you urge me to Garrulity? I tell you over and over again, all People look upon <HI>Te|lemachus</HI> to be an admirable Piece: Ne|ver did Hero appear upon the Stage with &s;uch an univer&s;al Applau&s;e. 'Tis witty, delicate, natural, 'tis my&s;terious and in|chanting; what would you have more? Oh! but &s;ay you, I do not ask your Sen|timents about the reli&s;h of the Publick; I am &s;ufficiently inform'd of the great
<PB N="2" REF="3">noi&s;e which this little Romance makes a|mong the curious; 'tis the Subject Ala|mode for Conver&s;ation; but I de&s;ire to know you Thoughts concerning it. To what an inconveniency do you expo&s;e me? I mu&s;t now be lookt upon in your Judgment for a ridiculous Manhater, if I cannot di&s;cover in this Piece, tho&s;e pre|tended Beauties that charm all other Rea|ders. Am I not already &s;ufficiently un|fortunate, to be po&s;e&s;s'd with a cro&s;s thwarting Humour, but that I mu&s;t be oblig'd my &s;elf to reveal my own Shame? All the World admires <HI>Telemachus;</HI> on the other &s;ide, I that can find nothing in it worthy Admiration, yet do my &s;elf this Ju&s;tice, for my want of a good Pal|ate, that I admire my own Stupidity. This I take to be an ingenious way of &s;hifting off the Condemnation of the Piece; and any other Per&s;on but your &s;elf would di&s;charge me, after &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion. You might blame me for my want of Judgment, without putting your &s;elf to the trouble of exacting my bad Rea&s;ons. But I know your Humour in re&s;pect of my &s;elf; my fanta&s;tical Con|ceits divert yee, and you have done me the Honour to tell me, that you take &s;ome kind of delight to &s;ee me fencing with the Multitude. It &s;hall not then be &s;aid,
<PB N="3" REF="3">that 'tis long of my ill Nature, or <HI>Momus</HI>-like Temper that you are not &s;atisfi'd. I will then faithfully Copy out the Idea which I have fancy'd to my &s;elf of the famous <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and give you leave to Laugh, upon condition that you laugh in a corner alone. I have but three A&s;&s;aults to make upon this impregnable Fortre&s;s. I &s;hall fir&s;t examin the de&s;ign that &s;ent <HI>Telemachus</HI> abroad into the World; in the next place, I mu&s;t attack the Style of this ingenious Fiction: And la&s;tly, I &s;hall endeavour to unfold the meaning of this &s;ame Satyr, altogether My&s;tical, which as &s;ome will have it, the Author has with &s;uch a zealous Devotion di&s;play'd again&s;t the Wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t Potent Government that ever was.</P>
<P>Now then, that I may make my Con|jectures, as all others do (for I mu&s;t tell you, I have no other foundation to a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf either of the Name or Intentions of the Author) The aim of the Work is Great, Noble and Lofty: To teach a young Prince the pure&s;t Maxims of Wi&s;|dom, to &s;et Vice before his Eyes in all the hideous &s;hapes of it, to make him re|li&s;h the lovely &s;weets of Vertue, to re|hear&s;e in his Ears a thou&s;and and a thou|&s;and times over, that Wickedne&s;s is the cau&s;e of all Misfortunes, and that Ju&s;tice
<PB N="4" REF="4">is the Fountain of all Happine&s;s; to form his Mind according to the mo&s;t lively Lights of Knowledge and Under&s;tanding; to render his Heart impenetrable again&s;t all Irregularity, this is to conceive a de|&s;ign to rai&s;e his Royal Pupil to the Pina|cle of Glory, and to procure the Felici|ty of the People, who are one Day to live under the Dominion of this young Prince. But with your good leave, has this de&s;ign been put in execution, in &s;uch a manner as to promi&s;e good Succe&s;s? For my part, had I an intention to &s;poil a young Inclination, I would give &s;uch a Youth <HI>Telemachus</HI> for his Pocket Book. Nor can I di&s;approve the Raillery of a Courtier, who was &s;aying t'other Day, that if the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> were wholly guided by this Romance, the Crown of <HI>France</HI> would be in danger of falling un|der the Government of a Di&s;taff. They with whom he was joaking, under&s;tood no other wit in his Je&s;t, but that he meant <HI>Minerva</HI> in di&s;gui&s;e. But he drove higher, as I under&s;tood from one of his Ac|quaintance; for his meaning was, that if ever a <HI>Telemachus</HI> raign'd, under the Au|&s;pices, and by the Coun&s;els of &s;uch a &s;evere Godde&s;s, Vi&s;ion, Chimera, and Fanatici&s;m would &s;it upon the Throne. If you gue&s;s, as I make no que&s;tion but
<PB N="5" REF="4">you do, at the Brain that was deliver'd of this Fancy of a Romance, beware of revealing it: For in je&s;ting with Jupiters Wi&s;dom, you would ruin the Reputation of a judicious Man, which an illu&s;trious Friend has acquir'd in the World; there would not be a Wit o'th'Town but would be ready to throw a Stone at him, and all would cry out, that 'twould be better for them to be lodg'd in a Mad-hou&s;e than in his great Palace. But &s;ince 'tis yours and my Profe&s;&s;ion not to judge of things by the common reli&s;h, let us weigh his Proofs, and &s;ee who is in the right, whe|ther he or all Mankind be&s;ide. You your &s;elf have told me a Hundred times, that the Labours of Fiction are poy&s;on'd Springs, from whence young People know not how to draw, without intere&s;t|ing the Exactne&s;s of Di&s;cernment, and and without receiving dangerous Impre&s;|&s;ions again&s;t the uprightne&s;s of the Soul. Poets and Writers of Romances never &s;peak like other Men, being forc'd to follow another Road then that of Na|ture, to arrive at that &s;ublimity which they &s;eek for in them&s;elves, they overdo what ever they go about. The Fire of Imagination, in them, &s;upplies the place of profound Rea&s;oning. But reduce the&s;e pompous De&s;criptions, the&s;e glit|tering
<PB N="6" REF="5">Images, this refin'd <HI>Tour</HI> to the Terms of good Sen&s;e, 'tis only the fla&s;h of the Powder that has pa&s;s'd before your Eyes, and leaves nothing behind but the ill &s;cent. Nature and Truth are in the Hands of the&s;e Gentlemen to be dawb'd, and fucu&s;s'd over as much as they &s;hall think proper for their own Purpo&s;es: Never believe that they pre&s;ent before us tho&s;e two Countenances with that &s;im|plicity which is their principal Ornament. They are a&s;ham'd to &s;ay with the Vul|gar, that the Sun ri&s;es and &s;ets; that it has been a plentiful Harve&s;t; that the Meadow is cover'd with Flowers; that the Water is clear; that the Trees are laden with Fruit. Pitiful Expre&s;&s;ions that wou'd make tho&s;e in&s;pir'd Enthu&s;ia&s;ts blu&s;h There is a much more noble elevation of Wit to be made u&s;e of in explaining to us the Motions of Nature, under the &s;ublime Emblems of Dewy Charies, Chry&s;tal, Pearls, Diamonds, and all tho&s;e other pretty Toys of which our <HI>Telemachus</HI> is a true Magazine. Is he to commend a good Prince? He is exempt from all humane Infirmities; his Merit &s;urpa&s;&s;es Imagina|tion, and he has perform'd tho&s;e At|chievements for which there want exam|ples in Story; and the Vertue of that He|ro is as inconceivable as <HI>Pure Love.</HI> It is
<PB N="7" REF="5">his bu&s;ine&s;s to cen&s;ure the Conduct of an ill King? there's no mercy to be expect|ed, he is a Tyrant; he has made unju&s;t Wars; he has broken Faith with his Con|federates; in the mid&s;t of Peace he has &s;urpris'd 'em, pillag'd their Cities, burnt their Hou&s;es under ridiculous pretences; he has violated his Oaths, ruin'd his Peo|ple; he has invaded the Rights of God, oppre&s;s'd his mo&s;t faithful Subjects; he has openly ju&s;tifi'd Adultery; he is a mon&s;ter abandon'd to his own Obduracy; 'tis in vain for him to have recour&s;e to the Gods, they are inexorable to his Prayers; their anger is ju&s;t ready to thun|der upon his Head; Mon&s;ieur the Poet has pronounc'd the Decree, nor will he bate a tittle of the Sentence. Well, Sir, what do you think ont? d'ye believe a young Prince to be well plae'd in the Hands of &s;uch a &s;ort of Guides? Some|times climbing to the top of a Mountain, &s;ometimes de&s;cending to the bottom of a Valley; never moving upon even Ground; to have always a &s;lippery Ice before their Eyes; call you this an ea&s;y Road to ar|rive happily at a Throne? To what pur|po&s;e is it to create an imaginary World in order to teach a young Prince how to reign in ours? Our Kings are not like Kings upon a Theatre, who only enter up|on
<PB N="8" REF="6">on the Stage to repre&s;ent fabulous Per|&s;ons; They ought to govern according to the Laws, and according to the pre&s;ent time, and this is that wherein they ought to be in&s;tructed, without fetching compa&s;&s;es about, and the refinement of Hyperboli|cal Language. You will not deny but that Kings have more need of Judgment and Penetration then other Men, for they &s;uffer them&s;elves too frequently to be &s;urpriz'd by prejudice; and that crowd of Flatterers which environs 'em is a Rail that Truth has much ado to leap over. How then is it po&s;&s;ible for a young Prince to walk in a hazardous Country, where he runs from Phantom to Phantom, from fal&s;hood to fal&s;hood, where he meets with none but Objects capable to &s;educe a better in&s;tructed Rea&s;on then his own? Did you never &s;pend a &s;erious thought, Sir, upon the&s;e Portraictures &s;o flattering and &s;o apt to tickle the Sen&s;es? I am cer|tain you would never, upon &s;uch Con&s;i|derations, expo&s;e &s;uch charming delu&s;ions to the Eyes of your Family, much le&s;s, if you have been call'd to the Prelature, would you do it to any other Per&s;on. What &s;hall we &s;ay of tho&s;e Courte&s;ans of Godde&s;&s;es, amourous even to Tran&s;port, pen&s;ive, jealous, re&s;tle&s;s, furious, and &s;ometimes driven to di&s;pair? The devo|tion
<PB N="9" REF="6">of the <HI>Cretan</HI> Women for <HI>Venus</HI> and her Plea&s;ures? the Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI> to captivate <HI>Telemachus</HI> in her golden Tre&s;&s;es, and the fruitle&s;s Toyls of <HI>Cupid</HI> to the &s;ame purpo&s;e? You may look upon the&s;e things as Trifles if you plea&s;e, but in my Opi|nion, the leading of a young Prince in|to the&s;e &s;lippery places, is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure to couple his Mind with Super&s;tition, and expo&s;e his Heart to dangerous At|tacks; for in &s;hort, what a &s;trange me|thod is it for the in&s;tructing of a Chri&s;tian Soul, to teach it down right Pagani&s;m, to carry a Di&s;ciple into inchanted Places with an intent to infu&s;e into him an ab|horrence of Plea&s;ure, to expo&s;e him to violent Temptations, with a de&s;ign to render his Innocence invincible? This is the utmo&s;t that a con&s;ummate Quiete&s;t dur&s;t pre&s;ume to undertake; and yet perhaps, he would find a nece&s;&s;ity of intrenching him&s;elf well before hand in his pa&s;&s;ive Condition, to dige&s;t his Scru|ples, and to prevent his con&s;enting to the &s;weet impre&s;&s;ions of Objects. But youth is not &s;ufficiently harden'd to tho&s;e inte|riour Combats, to be led after &s;uch a manner into the Fire: We know it has a far greater inclination to Vice then of Vertue: It needs no encouragement to idolize Plea&s;ure; rather, unle&s;s it be of
<PB N="10" REF="7">an extraordinary Temper, what &s;hould incite him to de&s;pi&s;e it? The rea&s;on of a young Man is not ripe enough for Truth; Age and Experience are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to convince him of tho&s;e noble and great re&s;emblances and agreements where|in this Truth con&s;i&s;ts: But has the Sen&s;e of a young Man &s;ufficient Vigour to re&s;i&s;t the Allurements of Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s? Now then to expo&s;e before a young Prince the view of Plea&s;ure almo&s;t &s;tark naked, un|der pretence that it unfolds the Truths of Salvation and Morality, what is this but to enervate his Mind by flattering his Pa&s;|&s;ions? rather is it not as if a Phy&s;ician &s;hould give Poy&s;on to a feeble Stomach, to procure the dige&s;tion of &s;trong Food? Is not this to corrupt at the &s;ame time that he pretends to in&s;truct? This is but a bad &s;ort of Pedagogie; however it is <HI>Telemachus</HI> all over. <HI>Mentor</HI> &s;peaks the noble&s;t things in the World, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s it; but the Author with his Roman|tick Chain of yolle Stories, de&s;troys the virtue of the Exhortations, like an old Dotard as he is. <HI>Mentor</HI> preaches up one Holy God, Almighty, Immen&s;e, In|comprehen&s;ible, and Adorable; the Au|thor teaches a company of vicious Deities, bounded in their Power; Vagabonds, familiar, ignorant and pa&s;&s;ionate. <HI>Men|tor</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="7">corroborates the heart again&s;t Sloth and Female tenderne&s;s; the Author does all he can to render it Effeminate. <HI>Men|tor</HI> makes Happine&s;s to con&s;i&s;t in Vertue; the Author makes it always unfortunate, and introduces the wicked always happy till Death. <HI>Mentor</HI> would have a King to be ju&s;t, and that he &s;hould Sacrifice him&s;elf for the welfare of his People; the Authors Hero's are two Princes, one of which abandons his Subjects to revenge the Quarrel of a Mi&s;tre&s;s; the other Scap|erloiters about the World like a Cox|comb, leaving his Mother and his Coun|try a Prey to a company of Rivals. The pa|rallel would make you &s;tare, &s;hould I car|ry it as far as I could &s;tretch it. Stay but till I examin the Tomes apart, and you &s;hall have more plea&s;ant Encounters to make you merry. In the mean time I be&s;eech yee allow me one thing; That this Piece being an Ambiguous Contexture of Piety and Super&s;tition, of Error and Truth of Figure and Natural, of Vice and Ver|tue, of good and bad Sen&s;e, it favours the Inclination of a young Prince to Evil, and is only fit to perplex and confound his Ideas of Good. But here you will object and cry, this is all but &s;la&s;hing the Air. He that proves too much proves nothing: According to your Conclu&s;ions, Youth
<PB N="12" REF="8">mu&s;t be excluded from reading the Poets, and all manner of Fictions, and then the Lord have Mercy upon yee; for all the Regents of Colledges, and Ma&s;ters of Schools, would fall about your Ears, and tho&s;e Pedantick People are a terrible &s;ort of Enemies, who are always in Arms, and their La&s;hes will fetch Blood through a Quire of Brown Paper. Well, Sir, let 'em be as terrible as they plea&s;e, their Menaces are not able to terrify me. Thanks to my evil De&s;tiny, I fear neither Eagles nor Crows. But you mi&s;take the &s;en&s;e of my Sentiments, and therefore for your better information, let us argue a little after the venerable manner of the Schools. I offer yee this Propo&s;ition. A prudent Tutor ought not, on purpo&s;e to compo&s;e a Romance interwoven with Sacred and Prophane, to form the Mind and Heart of a young Prince: From whence you conclude, that all Poetry is pernicious to young People. But this is no good Lo|gick; for you argue from a Particular to a General. Tho' I had Learning, and Credit &s;ufficient to bani&s;h out of Colledges the Illu&s;ion and Bomba&s;tical Style of Poetry, I would not de&s;ire to merit the Name of a Reformer in the Republick of Learning: That Honour would be due to a Per&s;on who for Erudition and De|licacy,
<PB N="13" REF="8">is none of the meane&s;t Ornaments of the Age: You know who I mean. But I pretend not to go too far. I agree with who&s;oever plea&s;es to agree with me, that good Poetry may be profitable to Youth in many things; It is an Art that requires Application, and procures to the Wit a Felicity to unfold and penetrate many Difficulties. Salt and Poynancy, which are as it were the Soul of that in|genious Amu&s;ement, afford Matter for that which is called <HI>Brilliant.</HI> Neither are Fictions barren Images; they &s;erve to render the Wit inventive, and Invention is the Mother of publick Benefit. But what is all this to my The&s;is? Is it le&s;s certain, that Poetry and Romances are two Rocks again&s;t which good Sen&s;e and Vertue &s;plit them&s;elves a thou&s;and times, and &s;uffer Shipwrack? For which rea&s;on it is, that prudent Ma&s;ters will never let their Di&s;ciples be out of their &s;ight when they give 'em leave to ramble that &s;lippe|ry Tract, &s;o &s;teep and full of Precipices. Have a care they cry, this Idea is fal&s;e, that Conceit is poor and fla&s;hy, that piece of Morality is corrupt, that Example is to be abominated. We only pa&s;s the&s;e Phantoms &s;lightly before your Eyes, be|cau&s;e 'tis fit you &s;hould know every thing, and becau&s;e there is a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmit|ting
<PB N="14" REF="9">to the Tyranny of Cu&s;tom. What would you think, Sir, after all this of a grave and devout Preceptor who &s;hould bethink him&s;elf of ramma&s;&s;ing all the&s;e Follies together, and incorporating 'em into one Romance, with an intention to infu&s;e-into a young Prince his Pupil, a &s;olid Piety, Ju&s;tice incorruptible, a Pati|ence proof again&s;t all Tryal, a Courage un&s;urmountable, a right Sen&s;e, and an exact Di&s;cernment; in a Word, all the Qualities that might render a King wor|thy his Di&s;tinction. A goodly Catechi&s;m you'll &s;ay, and pre&s;ently reply, &s;uch a Guide would lay the Snare, dig the Ditch, and make the Bait him&s;elf. Ne|verthele&s;s, this is <HI>Telemachus</HI>'s de&s;ign, if the publick have done him Ju&s;tice. It may be you will be skirmi&s;hing with your Objections again&s;t me, and tell me that 'tis lawful for a Tutor to make u&s;e of his own Romances, as well as of tho&s;e which are compo&s;s'd by theirs, and that provided he order his Di&s;ciples to read 'em with nece&s;&s;ary precautions, nothing hinders but that his Wit may prove an Honour to him. But what you get by this you may put in your Eye. For a Tutor is made choice of to meet the mi&s;chief, not to give occa&s;ions for the growth of it. 'Tis his duty to weed a|way
<PB N="15" REF="9">whatever may prove de&s;tructive to his young Plant, and not to &s;et any thing near it, that may feed it with ill juice. This Tutor is the young Princes Spiri|tual Phy&s;ician, 'tis his Duty to let him know which are good, which are bad Nouri&s;hments; but if the Phy&s;ician &s;hould him&s;elf prepare dangerous Food for his Patient, in hopes to have the Honour of preventing the ill Con&s;equences of it, think you that would be well done? I am &s;ure, you do not belive that &s;uch a man could act with a &s;afe Con&s;cience; nor would you, if once it came to be known, di&s;charge him upon a bare Repentance. Let us drive the Nail as far as it will go. <HI>Telemachus</HI> is a Compo&s;ition of Fiction and Truth, of Vices and Vertues, of Good and Evill: The Tutor who is a Man Able, Eloquent, Per&s;wa&s;ive and a profound My|&s;tick every Inch of him, employs all the &s;trength of his great Genius to hinder the young Prince from mi&s;taking his cour&s;e between the&s;e two oppo&s;ites. He makes him under&s;tand the Ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of Ficton, the deformity of Evil, the beauty of Vertue, and the reputation that attends Men of worth: But who has told this <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> that his <HI>Alexander</HI> will be|lieve him upon his Word? If the young Prince be of a temper to be carried away
<PB N="16" REF="10">with Hyperboles and Figures; If he be of a merciful Humour, not to let a fair Godde&s;s dye for Love; If <HI>Cupid</HI> &s;ubdue him under the Empire of <HI>Venus;</HI> If he takes a liking to the Religion of the In|habitants of <HI>Craete;</HI> If the di&s;potici&s;m and avarice of <HI>Pygmalion</HI> do not offend him; And la&s;tly, If in&s;tead of taking out all the Honey of the Romance, he &s;ucks out all the Venom, Theres a young Prince quite &s;poil'd: and when he comes to be King, his Subjects mu&s;t be mi&s;erable; and all this will be charg'd to our Tutors account. Would you believe it, Sir, that this famous <HI>Telemachus,</HI> upon whom all People be&s;tow their Panegyricks, and &s;trew Flowers, that I may &s;peak like a Poet, by whole Baskets full, &s;hould one day prove the cau&s;e of mo&s;t di&s;mal effects, and con&s;equently become the Object of publick Malediction? I know that I com|bat with a Fly, and that the Misfortune will never happen: It may be <HI>Telemachus</HI> will be better advis'd then to turn Peda|gogue: But tho' he &s;hould have aim'd at the Education of a Prince &s;o well known to us, there would have been no danger. That Prince is too well born to turn to his ruin what was only compo&s;s'd for his pre&s;ervation: But in &s;hort the thing is not impo&s;&s;ible; and that is &s;ufficient for me
<PB N="17" REF="10">to condemn the de&s;ign which is a&s;crib'd to the Work. In a Word, Sir, Why &s;hould he not follow the beaten Road? Why &s;hould not every Flower be gather'd from its own Bed? The true Method of in&s;tructing Youth is rightly to teach the di&s;tinction of Ideas, by never confound|ing Matters. Every In&s;truction ought to be deriv'd from its own Spring: Let Re|ligion be drawn from the &s;acred Scrip|tures; Mythology from Fables; The knowledge of Nature from Philo&s;ophy; Actions from Hi&s;tory; And Morality from the World, which is the great Vo|lume. Upon the&s;e different Subjects let 'em a Gods name, make as many and as long Commentaries as they &s;hall judge convenient; but let it be done without anticipating one matter by another. For if you once confound 'em, you make a Gallimawfrey that di&s;tracts the Under|&s;tanding of the Di&s;ciple; and while you go about to teach him all at a time, he learns nothing as he ought to do. From whence there is &s;o much the more rea&s;on why great, Capital, and E&s;&s;ential Truths &s;hould never be in&s;erted in Romances. In good earne&s;t, this is to encha&s;e precious Stones in pitiful guilded Clay: Tho&s;e fal&s;e Adventures are recounted with an Air of &s;incerity, exact Circum&s;tances,
<PB N="18" REF="11">and all the appearances of Truth. Which way now to prevent a Youth from being deceiv'd? If he believes 'em, he's in a fair way to mi&s;take Error for Truth. Is he then capable of tho&s;e &s;ublime Speculations and of tho&s;e noble Maxims which they endeavour to infu&s;e into him? If he be apprehen&s;ive of the Fiction, he &s;tands upon his guard again&s;t &s;urprize. He reads tho&s;e things which are lea&s;t &s;ubject to contradiction, as tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t remote from good Sen&s;e. So that in a well continu'd Romance, and Pieces well knit together, &s;uch as is <HI>Telemachus,</HI> Fal&s;hood becomes an ob&s;tacle to Truth, and Truth inclines the Reader to believe the Fal&s;hood. Would you know to whom I compare <HI>Mentor</HI> in the frequent Exhortations which he gives <HI>Telemachus?</HI> Even to an Orator that never would pro|nounce any other then fal&s;e Panegyricks, nor ever would explain him&s;elf but by fal&s;e Texts. For example, Sir, <HI>Mentor</HI> preaches like a Doctor in Romances: He rai&s;es &s;ome Per&s;ons to the very Skies, and throws down others to the bottom of Hell: There is not one action that he prai&s;es but what is invented; nor is there any one which he condemns which is not Chymerical, what credit is there then to be given to the&s;e charming Di&s;|cour&s;es?
<PB N="19" REF="11">When he Dogmatizes like a <HI>Plato,</HI> Moralizes like a <HI>Socrates,</HI> and Di&s;cour&s;es like a <HI>Cato,</HI> concerning the Happine&s;s and Liberty of the People, they are like Struc|tures without a Foundation: They are Con&s;equences which being erroneous in the fir&s;t Principle, fall and them&s;elves de|&s;troy them&s;elves. For example, behold an Inference of <HI>Mentors</HI> Morality.

<P>You gue&s;s no doubt, Sir, what I drive at; and knowing my Genious &s;o well as you do, 'tis ea&s;y for you to imagine that I am clearly out of conceit with this &s;ort of Poetical Pro&s;e. I do not pretend to refinene&s;s of Wit; you are in the right on't, I admire, as another Man would do, when I am &s;poken to plainly and Politely, provided they &s;peak to me in the Language of Mankind, as three fa|mous Writers in your <HI>Holland</HI> very lucki|ly

The Poets boa&s;t, that their Language is the Language of the Gods. In good truth, they &s;peak better then they are aware of; for from this Confe&s;&s;ion we may conclude, that neither mortal Men under&s;tand them, nor that they un|der&s;tand them&s;elves. However, if they have receiv'd by infu&s;ion the under&s;tand|ing of what they write, let 'em write for the Gods as much as they plea&s;e; Let 'em walk upon Stilts; Let 'em heap Fiction upon Fiction; Let 'em de&s;cend from their high flow Jargonry; Let 'em climb up to the Clouds; Let 'em immure them&s;elves within the narrow limits of Mea&s;ure, Number, and Cadence, we have nothing to &s;ay to 'em. The&s;e are a &s;ort of Birds that make u&s;e of their Wings to fly to <HI>Parna&s;&s;us:</HI> the beauty of their Plumage is as reall as the Divinity of <HI>Apollo.</HI> Thats nothing to the purpo&s;e; the&s;e Birds have the priviledge to &s;upport them&s;elves in the Air; let 'em enjoy it; theres nobody envies 'em their Happine&s;s; But let 'em not infect the Earth with their Vi&s;ions and their Dreams; Let 'em not intrude

'Tis not ju&s;t that fal&s;hood &s;hould cloath it &s;elf in the Ve&s;t|ments of Truth, for then what way will there be to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other? Pro&s;e is the natural means that Men make u&s;e of to communicate their Ideas one to another, to open their Hearts and intermix their Souls; it is the Vehicle of the light and warmth of Wit, as the Air is the conveyance of the Light and heat of the Sun. Through this the Sciences are transfus'd; by this the Laws are publi&s;h'd and ob&s;erv'd, Equity &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts, and Sincerity maintains it &s;elf. 'Tis the Language of Society; nor do I know any People in the World that expre&s;s them&s;elves, that Rea&s;on, that In&s;truct one another or govern in Ver&s;e. 'Tis upon this Ground, as I believe, at lea&s;t I do not know a better, that among clear &s;ighted People there is &s;o much pains taken to poli&s;h the Language of the Country: they pare off the mean, impure, exce&s;&s;ive and too much figur'd Expre&s;&s;ions: The People are de&s;irous to think nothing but what is &s;olid, they are willing to &s;peak as they think, and they are in the right on't.

Could the Pre&s;ence of God in&s;pire him to paint forth a Lye, with a laborious Pencil in the Colours of Truth? Had the Author wrote in Ver&s;e, he could not have been altogether excu&s;able, but there might have been le&s;s Cau&s;e to blame him. 'Tis true, that he could never have e&s;cap'd the Reproach of having mi&s;|&s;pent his lei&s;ure Hours, in having di&s;|honour'd his Profe&s;&s;ion; and having in|terrupted my&s;tical Contemplation by vain Amu&s;ements.

They are not like the French who never think 'em&s;elves fully happy, unle&s;s they publi&s;h their good Fortune to all the World; be&s;ides that <HI>Telemachus</HI> might &s;teal &s;omething from his dear Nymph, and never let Men know of it. No, Sir, call me Ob&s;tinate and Incredulous as long as you plea&s;e, I will never agree to the Sentiments of the Public. The Public, notwith&s;tand|ing all the Re&s;pect that I owe it, is a Back|biter. 'Tis not po&s;&s;ible, that a My&s;tic &s;hould be &s;uch an Arti&s;t in making Love, tho' it was a pure Amour, intended only to lawful Enjoyment. There is too great an Oppo&s;ition between Sacred and Pro|phane Love. Sacred Love is without In|tere&s;t, and without return of Reward. on the other &s;ide, Prophane Love is not &s;atisfi'd with the Plea&s;ure of Loving; his Genero&s;ity is intere&s;ted, there mu&s;t be a Reciprocal Return of Body and Soul.

<PB N="26" REF="15">Prelate, &s;wallow'd up in the Di&s;inter|e&s;tment of Divine Love, &s;hould under|&s;tand &s;o well the petty Traffic of Lovers? A Quieti&s;t lives at Re&s;t without Action; bur two Hearts that love each other are always in Motion. No, believe me, 'tis not the great Arch-Bi&s;hop, who is the Author of <HI>Telemachus;</HI> and could I write with &s;o much ea&s;e, as I have Ve|neration for his Merit, I would &s;toutly undertake his Defence and write his A|pology, though I ran the hazard of ha|ving the Lye given me by all that knew the contrary.

Pardon me the Expre&s;&s;ions; for here it is that I find my Wrath a little inflam'd; in&s;omuch that I could wi&s;h my &s;elf Proctor Gene|ral of the Nation, that I might have the Liberty to pro&s;ecute the Author. I would &s;ummon him to appear before the Tribunal of Good Sence, that he might be fairly and duly condemn'd to &s;tand in a white Sheet, with a Torch

You talk at your ea&s;e with your Dutch Flegm. But 'tis in good earne&s;t that I am angry at this Minute, and without any other Form of Proce&s;s, I condemn <HI>Telemachus</HI> that is in my Study, to be burnt by all the common Hang|men of <HI>France.</HI> How! <HI>Telemachus</HI> that was compos'd for the Education of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy!</HI> You mi&s;take &s;ure: The Author had another De&s;ign in his Head. As he has a great deal of Wit he had a mind to &s;port with the Incon|&s;tancy of <HI>France,</HI> and to diverti&s;e him|&s;elf alone behind the Curtain. Do not you call my Conjecture a Vi&s;ion; I ground it upon the Succe&s;s of the Work, and if the Author had built upon that Platform, he would have had all the Rea&s;on in the World to have been &s;a, tisfi'd with his De&s;ign. 'Tis in Matter of Wit the French &s;trive to excel other Nations, in judging &s;oundly of another Man's Works. They flatter them&s;elves that they enjoy by a certain Priviledge that happy Penetration which makes
<PB N="28" REF="16">them di&s;tingui&s;h Solidity from fal&s;e Lu&s;tre. Never till now did they pu&s;h on &s;o far this pretended Delicacy of theirs.

But 'tis a Plea&s;ure at <HI>Paris</HI> to &s;ee the Book&s;ellers Shops full of a Number of Cen&s;urers; who decide the Fate of Books like Oracles, and tell ye with an erected Eyebrow, this creeps, that clambers. We are come off from the&s;e Simplici|ties; why &s;hould the Pre&s;s be &s;ully'd with &s;uch na&s;ty Sottici&s;ms. Men are become altogether Men: they are no lon|ger pleas'd with any thing but what is Natural and Judicious; we de&s;ire &s;ome|thing that may in&s;truct us, not amu&s;e us.

This brings a Fancy into my Head. The E|nemies of our incomparable Prince, have given out a long time that he was pro|jecting the Conque&s;t of all <HI>Europe.</HI> The Calumny was too palpable. The King's Ju&s;tice and Moderation is too well known, and his Maje&s;ty has given illu&s;trious Proofs of in, in &s;topping &s;everal times the Rapid Cour&s;e of his Victorious Arms, and giving Peace to <HI>Europe:</HI> The Truth is this, that if <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great did not &s;eek to be Ma&s;ter of <HI>Europe,</HI> he was very near being &s;o, till Heaven,

There has &s;omething of this Nature befall'n our Nation, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;'d with her own Me|rit, thro' the Succe&s;s with which they have cultivated the Liberal Arts and Sci|ences and all manner of Learning.

But an unknown Per&s;on comes and throws him&s;elf in the way, and not being able to endure &s;o much Pride, it comes into his Head to bring her a Pegg lower. What does he do? Like an hone&s;t Pla|giarie, He Pillages the Poets; he pilfers a Dream from one, a wild piece of Do|tage from another, to give a kind of Solidity to the&s;e hollow Imaginations; he dre&s;&s;es up a Fable Alamode; and let's it run about the Streets; pre&s;ently behold all the French Men at the heels of it: 'Tis in vain to cry, Stop: This Pro&s;e is a Curti&s;an in di&s;gui&s;e; her Dre&s;s

A <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> never contta|dicts him&s;elf; he knows what he loves, and &s;eeks it after his own manner. But the <HI>French</HI> who cry out every where for Sub&s;tance, good Nouri&s;hment, good Juice, &s;erve their Tables with painted Me&s;&s;es, and devour 'em. I excu&s;e this Tran&s;port in your Refugees: Not but that I believe 'em to be People of Wit, but their Souls are not in their natural &s;cituation.

What do you
<PB N="33" REF="18">find &s;o wonderful in all this?

The Author might have let a|lone that Daughter of <HI>Jupiter</HI> to enjoy the Advantages of her Birth in quiet, and have taken the fir&s;t that came of the Clarks in his Dioce&s;s; I &s;peak only by way of &s;uppo&s;ition. I am &s;ure that with a little good Sen&s;e, and ea&s;ine&s;s to ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf, he might have &s;aid as much as the Divine Pedagogue. Wherein con|&s;i&s;ts the Excellency of that Morality which enchants the World &s;o much? In continually repeating the &s;ame Precepts? I a&s;&s;ure ye, that <HI>Mentor</HI> had great need of being a God, to &s;ucceed in his Per&s;wa&s;ions: His Doctoral Style could not be thinner, He neither proves, nor demon&s;trates the Effect by the Cau&s;e, nor the Cau&s;e by the Effect. All his Philo&s;ophy is reduc'd to this &s;mall Inference: They did this, and were commended, therefore you ought to do &s;o too. They did this and were blam'd, therefore you ought to have a care how you follow their Example. Mu&s;t a Man be cleft out of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Skull to &s;ay this? 'Tis true indeed, that
<PB N="34" REF="19">the fluency of the Words &s;upplies the force of the Rea&s;oning. If it be true then, that a Judicious Reader be no Friend to a Conci&s;e Stile, then indeed I am too blame, to wonder that <HI>Telemachus</HI> is &s;o much admir'd; for in&s;tead of including much Sen&s;e in few words, 'tis much more when a pompous di&s;play of words furni&s;hes us with a reli&s;h of good Sen&s;e. The Mi&s;chif is, that the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions as frequently return as the &s;ame Things. Never was Man &s;o wealthy in Synoni|mous Terms; &s;o that I would willingly adopt in his favour the Eulogy, which an Enemy of the Accademy formerly gave to a Member of that Illu&s;trious Body. 'Tis &s;aid he, the be&s;t dough of Man in the World, he has a number of words which boults and &s;ifts over and over again, with a wonderful Dexterity. But 'tis now high time that I &s;hould have a fling at <HI>Tele|machus</HI> for his My&s;terious part; and I a|gree with you, that this is the Part which makes his Reputation &s;oar &s;o high.</P>
<P>My bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir, is here to penetrate the Intention of our Author. By all the Rules of Probity, my Critici&s;m ought not to go &s;o far; 'tis forbid me to grope ano|ther Man's Heart; 'tis a &s;ecret part, re|&s;erv'd only for God, a Confe&s;&s;or, and a Confident.

For Holy Men, and e&s;pecially My&s;tical Holy Men, will never tell a Lye; &s;o that had I nothing el&s;e to &s;ay to ye but that, the My&s;tery will be at the bottom.

'Tis very great; and I mu&s;t frank|ly acknowledge, that were they <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Polanders</HI> that were to interpret the Intention and di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Mentor,</HI> I &s;hould have nothing to object.

You look upon your &s;elves as Martyrs for the Cau&s;e of God and the Laws: And in|deed if Patience, Charity, Humility, Piety and good Living were eminent a|mong your People, your Faith would make the Con&s;cience of the mo&s;t zealous Catholick tremble: But in &s;hort, you be|lieve your &s;elves the Victims of an unju&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion; 'tis no wonder then, you &s;hould be &s;o highly pleas'd with what|ever decrys the Conduct of your Per&s;ecu|tor; in a word, I pardon you your Com|mentaries and your Exultations over <HI>Te|lemachus:</HI> The lea&s;t favour that can be granted to Innocent Unfortunates; much le&s;s will I quarrel with your Brethren that langui&s;h in the mid&s;t of us; their mi&s;|fortune is &s;till greater then yours.</P>
<P>But I have a &s;ecret Grudge again&s;t a Crowd of People, who boa&s;ting to bear the glorious Titles of Catholick and French Men, prophane both the one and the other, by &s;eeking in <HI>Telemachus</HI> the Cen&s;ure of our Admirable Government: For I ought not to conceal our Shame:
<PB N="37" REF="20">it is certain, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> has run thro' <HI>France,</HI> with as much or more Applau&s;e as in <HI>Holland:</HI> and that which vexes me mo&s;t is that they write me word from &s;everal Courts, that the Emba&s;&s;a|dors make this Book their Favorite Com|panion; &s;o that if what you &s;end me word be true, that the worthy Mini&s;ter that we have among you gave order that the Book|&s;eller &s;hould be well &s;chool'd, I &s;hall have a greater E&s;teem for him then ever I had, and hope to thank him in the Name of all good French Men, &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hall return. But don't you &s;ee, Sir, by this the Character of our Nation, without a Pro&s;pective Gla&s;s; When the French Men do not love their King, they are in&s;olent; when they obey a Prince whom they adore, even to dotage, they are overjoy'd when he is revil'd and rayl'd at. But let us &s;ee whether there be any ground for the imagining that <HI>Mentor</HI> has done it in <HI>Telemaehus.</HI> For my own part, who am a little Scrupulous and who &s;hould be very much troubl'd to think ill of my Neighbour, I had ra|ther believe that the Author of the Ro|mance, fill'd as he is, with veneration of our incomparable Monarch, has fetch'd a compa&s;s about to draw his Portraiture, and being unwilling to re&s;emble tho&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="21">flattering Hi&s;torians, who blind the Eyes of Princes with their Incen&s;e and their Smoak, he makes <HI>Minerva</HI> &s;peak in ge|neral. To be &s;hort, in all that <HI>Mentor</HI> un|folds to us of the Vettue, Glory and Me|rit of good Princes, is there any thing which does not pre&s;ently cau&s;e us to think of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.? In the hideous, and ex|travagant Pictures that <HI>Minerva</HI> gives us of Tyrants, can we refrain our Joy when we con&s;ider, that we have a Prince who is not &s;o wicked as they? But you will not be fatisfi'd with an Idea &s;o general. I know your Exactne&s;s; you mu&s;t have a particular Accompt; <HI>go too then:</HI> The fir&s;t and greate&s;t Quality that <HI>Mentor</HI> &s;eeks in a good Prince is, that he &s;hould live only for the &s;ake of his Subjects. Does not the King do &s;o? 'Tis only out of a de&s;ire to reign over his Subjects, that he de&s;ires to live, and he will Reign to the la&s;t ga&s;p of his Breath, or el&s;e he would not be Ma&s;ter. <HI>Mentor</HI> would have it, that the Prince &s;hould be the Father of his Country, and love his Subjects with as much tenderne&s;s as his own Children. Well, Sir, d' ye not &s;ee his Maje&s;ty to the Life in all this? People judge of the Tenderne&s;s of a Father by his extraordi|nary zeal, to &s;eek the good of his Chil|dren: Now I defie you and all your Hi|&s;torians
<PB N="39" REF="21">to find me out, &s;ince the founda|tion of Royalty, a Prince that has longer and more &s;ucce&s;sfully apply'd him&s;elf, as well in Per&s;on as by his Mini&s;ters, to &s;eek the welfare of his Subjects; I mean their Spiritual and Temporal Welfare: and to prove it to ye, for with a <HI>Hugonot,</HI> we mu&s;t be &s;ure to have good proofs for what we &s;ay; do not you conceive; Sir, that the true welfare of the People con|&s;i&s;ts in Plenty? Riches perhaps are a more dangerous Enemy; they are only fit to enfeeble natural Vigour, to feed Pa&s;&s;ion and ha&s;ten Death. The chief Happine&s;s of Life is to be Ma&s;ter of his own Hearth, to eat his Bread in Peace under the pro|tection of Ju&s;tice: Now are not we be|holding to the Kings Bounty for this in|e&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ing? When he a&s;cended the Throne, he found Subjects that knew not how to make u&s;e of Fortunes Favours: Money was in their hands, like a Knife in the Hand of a Madman. Troubles, Di&s;|orders, Rebellion was all the Talk of that Time: The Nobleman oppre&s;s'd the Pea|&s;ant; the Great men made the Little Ones turn about with the wind of their Pride and Capriccio; the Stronger gave Laws to the Weaker; From whence Du|els, Murders, Robberies, Inju&s;tice and Violence multiply'd; the People &s;wel'd
<PB N="40" REF="22">up with their own fat, no longer acknow|ledg'd any Ma&s;ter; or to &s;peak more pro|perly, they groan'd under the Yoke of an infinite number of petty Tyrants, &amp; forgot their Re&s;pect to their lawful Soveraign. The Princes, Governours, Parliaments, the Men in Credit, all the&s;e were like &s;o many Flambeaux, that kindl'd and fed the Fire of Revolt, under the &s;pecious pretence of maintaining the Law, and the pre&s;ervation of Liberty: Good Plea&s;ure, full Power and Soveraign Authority, de|pended upon all the&s;e Heads; and when Abu&s;es were to be reform'd, or Money was to be rais'd to &s;upply the Publick Nece&s;&s;ities, the Royal Maje&s;ty was ex|pos'd to Affront or Refu&s;all. Our Pru|dent Father of his Country has pluck'd up all the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs by the Roots, as a prudent Head of a Family ought to do: he has made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the whole. By that means his Kingdom is like a Hou&s;e well regulated, where the Father di&s;po&s;ing of the whole E&s;tate, retains every body in Order, in Subjection and in their Duty. Do we &s;ee any di&s;contented Prince under <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, betake him&s;elf to Arms to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice? Do we &s;ee Governors draw whole Pro|vinces after 'em, contrary to the Intere&s;t of the Sovereign? Do we behold Sediti|ous
<PB N="41" REF="22">Libels pre&s;ented in an A&s;&s;embly by the People's Deputies? Do we hear of any &s;harp and Stinging Remon&s;trances from a Parliament? So far from it, that the Ambition of Princes is calm'd, the Go|vernors are &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, the Parliaments &s;et open their Regi&s;ters, the People have no more to do but to open their Pur&s;es; ab&s;olute Power &s;preads its Influences eve|ry where, and every body libes in peace under his own Fig-tree. This Sir, is that; which among the Heroes is call'd &s;eeking the Temporal good of the People. You <HI>Dutchmen</HI> with your &s;hadow of Liberty, have no mind to agree to this. You look upon all us as Slaves and Beggars. 'Tis true our People are not &s;o fat as yours, nor our Country Pea&s;ants &s;o rich: But if Murders and in&s;urrections &s;hould hap|pen among you, is it not true, that you would wi&s;h to be in our places. Be&s;ides, you are not to imagine that our Prince heaps up abundance and draws it to him|&s;elf, to make a benefit of it, but to be a good Steward and a ju&s;t Di&s;pen&s;er of it. Do you not &s;ee that he labours &s;till un|der the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ities, that his Edicts ob&s;erve their Cour&s;e, and that tho' he be actually at peace, he is con&s;train'd to augment the Taxes? What does he do, &s;ay you, with tho&s;e prodigious Numbers
<PB N="42" REF="23">of Millions that go every Year into his Coffers? He generou&s;ly divides a Part to tho&s;e who have the Honour to &s;erve him, and principally to tho&s;e nota|ble Head-pieces that manage the Finan|ces: He maintains &s;ormidable Armies that make him the Arbiter of the Laws, and the Terror of his Neighbours: He en|larges his Palaces, and makes Embelli&s;h|ments there, that &s;urpa&s;s even wonder it &s;elf: He reforms Nature, by levelling Hills and digging new Rivers. Has he not need of Immen&s;e Summs for tho&s;e incompara|ble Beauties, who had Charms &s;ufficient to engage his Heart, and oft refre&s;h'd him, wearied with the Toils of Govern|ment? How many Cities purchas'd? How many Spies maintain'd abroad? I &s;ay no|thing of his famous Trafficking at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople;</HI> which if it were not the mo&s;t famous of all, was yet the mo&s;t beneficial to <HI>France.</HI> There is no need for me to in|form ye at this time how our great King has &s;ought, and &s;till &s;eeks the Spiritual Welfare of his Subjects; you that are an Ob&s;tinate Heretick know it too well: but the hardne&s;s of your Heart will not per|mit you to reap the Benefit of it; and this Pious Monarch &s;tays but till the day of Judgment to reproach you with it. <HI>Men|tor</HI> would have a King be ju&s;t; ours is &s;o.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="23">
<P>He has made Re&s;titution in earne&s;t, and re&s;tor'd to every one the be&s;t part of what belong'd to him. Ju&s;t, do you &s;ay, to his People? Yes, ju&s;ter then to his Enemies? The &s;ame is <HI>Lewis</HI> the Grand: If we un|der&s;tand by Ju&s;tice that which is rendred in Tribunals; never Prince was &s;o exactly careful in his Admini&s;tration. He has tur|ned out, and turn'd in all Officers of all &s;orts and &s;ifted their Employments. He has created new ones in Superior and Inferior Juri&s;dictions; and if the Judges are the Eyes of a Prince, as &s;ome will have it, it may be &s;aid without Flattery, that <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. is the mo&s;t quick-&s;ighted among Monarchs. If we mean Ju&s;tice that a King ought to render him&s;elf to his Sub|jects, 'tis that which our Prince never fail'd of. The French love Money, and when they have it can never live at quiet; they love Honour, and feed 'em&s;elves with it. What has our Prince done? He has taken away their Money, and given 'em Quiet and Ho|nour in Exchange. Is not the one better then the other? The French love their Trade; but as a good Catholick People, they love their Religion better. The King has &s;poil'd Trade, but he has exterminated Hugnenoti&s;m, have the People any rea&s;on to complain? You &s;hall hear a French Pea&s;ant, that can hardly pay his Taxes,
<PB N="44" REF="24">chatting after his Ru&s;tical Manner, over a Pint of Wine of the King's Conque&s;ts and Victories; and then is he in his King|dom. I hold an even Wager, he would not change his Condition with one of the Burgo-Ma&s;ters. Had you &s;een, in the time of the War our Beggars dancing about a Bonfire, you would agree with me, that Poverty becomes a <HI>French</HI> Man, and that it is but Ju&s;tice to reduce him to that Condition. But la&s;tly, one convining Proof of the King's great Ju&s;tice is, that the People never complain. You who &s;o regu|larly read the Gazette, have you ever ob|&s;erv'd that the People cry out for Bread, or that they murmur'd at the &s;carcity of Money, or pa&s;ted up Pa&s;quils, injurious to the Court? 'Tis true, the Gazetters and News Papers mention &s;ome &s;uch thing &s;ometimes; but as we are not oblig'd to keep Faith with Hugnenots, &s;o there is as little rea&s;on to credit 'em. <HI>Mentor</HI> de|claims again&s;t unju&s;t War; Is there any &s;uch? The Right of War is authoriz'd by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Ages. <HI>Alexander</HI> is not quoted in Hi&s;tory for a Robber, nor the <HI>Romans</HI> for U&s;urpers; were it &s;o, the Pulpits would not ring &s;o often as they do with their Names; and the Preachers would have a care how they &s;uly'd their Sacred Eloquence, by extolling every
<PB N="45" REF="24">Day thd Noble Actions of tho&s;e famous Conquerors. The King made u&s;e of this Right as another would have done. His Maje&s;ty has extended his Frontiers, he has conquer'd Cities and Provinces, and acting with more &s;incerity then tho&s;e ancient Lords of the World, who took all and re|&s;tor'd nothing, the King has re&s;tor'd more then he took, and has kept nothing but what he could not re&s;tore. But who told the&s;e Interpreters of <HI>Telemachus</HI> that our King ever undertook an unju&s;t war. Let 'em con&s;ult all the Declarations of War that have been publi&s;h'd &s;ince the King's Marriage; I am &s;ure they will not find one that does not contain a great deal of Rea&s;on. That concerning bad Satisfaction which one of our illu&s;trious De&s;erters ex|plain'd among you with his u&s;ual Deli|cacy, is may be the weake&s;t of all. But they who penetrate the Rea&s;ons of that bad Satisfaction, agree that the Com|plaint was not altogether ill grounded.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then that <HI>Telemachus</HI> is not more hap|py in his My&s;terious Part, then in his De&s;igns and his Stile. But to give &s;omething to the Publick; I &s;uppo&s;e with them, that <HI>Mentor</HI>'s Politicks are the Rever&s;e of the Government, and that 'tis that which has caus'd the di&s;grace of the <HI>A.</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray.</HI> Do you not believe with my &s;elf, that <HI>Mentor</HI>'s King is a Fanta&s;tic King, and that if Princes would reign according to the Memoirs of that old Dr. <HI>Minerva</HI> mu&s;t have
<PB N="46" REF="25" MS="y">de&s;cended to the Earth to overturn the World. If a King &s;hould ob&s;erve all tho&s;e divine Pre|cepts, he would become a Victim to his People, and his Condition would be wor&s;e then that of a private Per&s;on; I wi&s;h all Nations one of <HI>Men|tor</HI>'s Prince: but where will you find him: <HI>Mentor</HI> would have a King without Infirmities and Pa&s;&s;ions: Is this po&s;&s;ible; King's being Ma|&s;ters, and always Fle&s;h and Blood, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible but that they &s;hould be &s;ubject to no|torious Vices. An ambitious King ruines his People by War. A voluptuous Prince can give no good Example. A covetous King will &s;uck the Blood of his Subjects. A Heart of Iron will never be mov'd to Compa&s;&s;ion. A proud and de&s;potick Prince will domineer over all Man|kind. A Prince prejudicated with a fal&s;e Zeal will per&s;ecute to death; and &s;o of other Defects. 'Tis for the People to lay down their Necks, and bear the Burden. The&s;e, Sir, are the Ge|neral Remarks which I have made in Reading your <HI>Telemachus.</HI> You will hence conclude, that there is no great Matter in the Piece, or that I am but a Novice in the&s;e Matters. However, I &s;hall comfort my &s;elf with a full Per&s;wa&s;ion, that I have &s;aid nothing but what is true, and with the delight which I &s;hall take in having obey'd your Orders. If you think fit, burn this little Epi&s;tle, and take a &s;pecial Care that no Refugee may &s;ee it. Tho&s;e Gentlemen never love the Apologi&s;ts of our Court; and as I have a great E&s;teem for their Per&s;everance, I &s;hould be very much troubled to incur their Di&s;plea|&s;ure. Farewel, Sir, you know I am yours, <HI>ad Aras &amp; Focos.</HI> The re&s;t by the Porter. &mdash; <HI>Paris,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
