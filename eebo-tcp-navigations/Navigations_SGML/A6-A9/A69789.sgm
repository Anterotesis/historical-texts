D^R. <HI>CONNOR'^S</HI> PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my PREFACE to the First Volume of this <HI>Hi&s;torical Rela|tion of POLAND,</HI> I have men|tion'd my Incapacity for Matters of this Nature; both becau&s;e I was only Twelve Months in that Kingdom, and becau&s;e I have no Talent, or Genius, for Hi&s;tory. I thought, Writing it by way of LET|TERS, in Imitation of &s;ome of our Neighbours, would be more ea&s;ie to my &s;elf, and more acceptable to the Pub|lick. I am proud to have this happy Occa&s;ion of giving the Honourable Per|&s;ons I write to &s;o publick a Te&s;timony of my Re&s;pects. I am &s;orry in the &s;ame time, I cannot have Lei&s;ure to honour my &s;elf in writing to the Noble Per&s;ons men|tion'd
<PB REF="3">
in the Second Volume, as I have had in the First. I follow a Profe&s;&s;ion &s;o remote from HISTORY, particu|larly a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> one, that it neither allows me Time, nor leaves me any Inclination to attend any other Bu&s;ine&s;s. I hope notwith&s;tanding, the Per&s;ons I promis'd to write to, will be pleas'd to excu&s;e me for not being able to keep my Word to them, as I flatter'd my &s;elf I could, &s;ince the ingenious Gentleman I de&s;ir'd to undertake this Work will give them the &s;ame Satisfaction, he having already a&s;|&s;i&s;ted me in my First Volume, and ha|ving had all my Memoirs for this Se|cond.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Form of the Government in <HI>Poland,</HI> and of the King's Power, Court, and Revenues.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT high Station wherewith the King has Recompenc'd Your Merits, and the great Tru&s;t His Maje&s;ty has repo&s;ed in Your <HI>GRACE</HI> during his Ab&s;ence, &s;hews his Confidence in Your Ability, as well
<PB N="2" REF="4">
to Govern the <HI>State</HI> as the Church. Since therefore being lately Inve&s;ted with a &s;hare of the Regal Authority, you had occa&s;ion to know more intimately Our King's Power and Prerogatives, I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to give Your <HI>GRACE</HI> an Account of tho&s;e of the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> to the end, that compa|ring both together, you might more &s;en&s;ibly perceive the Excellency of our Own Con&s;ti|tution, which makes the Greatne&s;s of the King in&s;eparable from the Intere&s;t of the People: For when the Executive Power is as vigilant to &s;ee our Laws obey'd, as the Le|gi&s;lative has been provident in making them, <HI>England</HI> can ju&s;tly boa&s;t of a much greater Happine&s;s, than either <HI>Poland</HI> or any other Kingdom of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">From the Year <HI>550,</HI> to the Year <HI>1698.</HI></NOTE> Having, <HI>My LORD,</HI> not been a full Twelve Month at the late King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Court, I cannot pretend to be throughly ac|quainted with that Kingdom; yet I find that, like mo&s;t other Countries, it has undergone &s;everal Changes in its Con&s;titution &s;ince the middle of the VIth Century (at which time it began to be a di&s;tinct Nation) during the Reigns of the two great Hou&s;es of <HI>Pia&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Jagello.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Former Power of the Kings of <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> Ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Lechus</HI> its Foun|der, the Kings thereof have been Elected to the Crown after an Hereditary manner, tho' not by an Hereditary Title: They have re|ally been Ab&s;olute, and their Will went for a Law; for then they made Peace and War when they pleas'd, Levied as many Troops as they thought fit, Puni&s;h'd or Pardon'd at
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Plea&s;ure, and Rewarded where they &s;aw Con|venient: And all the Admini&s;tration, either of Public or Private Affairs was &s;o wholly lodg'd in the King's Hands, that I have heard the <HI>Poles</HI> them&s;elves &s;ay, That <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> II. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1574.</NOTE>the la&s;t King of the <HI>Jagellonic</HI> Family, was to the full as Ab&s;olute as either the King of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Denmark</HI> is now.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> thus maintain|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Advantage thereby.</NOTE>a Supream Power over their Subjects, they exceedingly enlarged their Dominions, were both fear'd Abroad, and belov'd at Home, Commanded Potent and Numerous Armies into the Field, Executed mo&s;t Enterprizes &s;peedily, and were almo&s;t always &s;ure of Suc|ce&s;s; and this becau&s;e they did not then, as now, depend upon the lingering Determina|tion, and tedious Conclu&s;ions of a Turbulent <HI>Diet.</HI> But the Family of <HI>Jagello</HI> being once Extinct, by the Death of <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> II. who had re&s;ign'd his Kingdom to the Senate and <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Gentry, and given them full Power and Authority to di&s;po&s;e thereof as they thought fit, the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> was anew declared <HI>Elective,</HI> to the end that all the Princes of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> who had due Merits and Quali|fications, might have a Right to A&s;pire there|unto.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Prin|ces Court the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Gentry.</NOTE> This gave occa&s;ion to mo&s;t of the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> ever &s;ince, to Court the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> No|bility after their King's Death: And that ei|ther to get the &s;ucceeding Election deter|mined in their own Favour, or el&s;e to have &s;ome of their Friends Advanced to that great Dignity; but this mo&s;t commonly rather with regard to their own private Intere&s;ts,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
than out of any Re&s;pect to the Per&s;on they de&s;ired to Promote; as the Hou&s;es of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Bourbon</HI> have always practis'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nobilities Re&s;olves thereupon,</NOTE> The Gentry of <HI>Poland</HI> therefore ob&s;erving that &s;everal Princes at a time always A&s;pir'd to their Crown, and con&s;idering that not one of them had more Right than the re&s;t; as like|wi&s;e that it lay altogether in their Power to choo&s;e whom they plea&s;ed, re&s;olved Unani|mou&s;ly to Elect none but &s;uch as &s;hould Con|de&s;cend, nay Swear, to ob&s;erve the Terms and Conditions they propo&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abridge the Antient Power of their Prin|ces,</NOTE> Hereby the <HI>Poles</HI> by degrees have clip'd and limited the Antient Power of their Kings, and have reduc'd them to the Bounds we now find them to have, that is, barely to a third Part of the Grand <HI>Diet:</HI> For the <HI>Poles</HI> knew very well, that no Prince would be &s;o Impru|dent as to &s;cruple Submitting to any Condi|tions, to become Ma&s;ter of &s;o con&s;iderable a Kingdom, to which he had no Right either by Birth or other Claim; and more e&s;pecial|ly &s;ince the&s;e Conditions are neither Rigorous nor Di&s;honourable, but &s;uch as are decently con&s;i&s;tent with the Regal Character he is to be Inve&s;ted with.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And Con&s;ti|tute a Re|public.</NOTE> Thus the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Gentry, of a kind of Mo|narchical Government, have in time made a perfect <HI>Republic,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of three Orders; The King, Senate, and Gentry; which they call the Nobility.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divi&s;ion of the People of <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> Here, <HI>My Lord,</HI> I mu&s;t take notice to Your GRACE, that the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nation is divided into two &s;orts of People, the Gentry or Freeborn Subjects, who are hardly a Tenth Part of the Kingdom, and the Va&s;&s;als, who
<PB N="5" REF="5">
are no better than Slaves to the Gentry, for they have no Benefit of the Laws, can Buy no E&s;tates, nor Enjoy any Property no more than our <HI>Negroes</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> can and this becau&s;e &s;ome Ages &s;ince the Com|mon People Revolting again&s;t their Lords, and having driven them out of the Nation, the Gentry came with a Foreign Power, and reduced them to a greater Subjection than be|fore, in which they have been kept ever &s;ince. So that the Government of <HI>Poland</HI> at pre&s;ent comprehends only the King and Gen|try. By a Gentleman or Nobleman of <HI>Po|land,</HI> is under&s;tood a Per&s;on who either him|&s;elf, or his Family, has a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in Land: For they never Intermarry with the Common People. All the Gentry from the King's Sons to tho&s;e that are but only Ma&s;ters of an Acre of Land, are equally Noble, both by their Birth and the Con&s;titution of the Kingdom; for no Body is Born either a Palatine, <HI>Senator,</HI> or Lord, but tho&s;e Titles are always annex|ed to certain Employments, which the King only gives to Per&s;ons advanced in Age, and recommended by their Merits.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diet.</NOTE> The <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> (in &s;ome re&s;pects) re|&s;embles our Parliament, being made up of two Hou&s;es; the Hou&s;e of <HI>Senators,</HI> an&s;werable to our Hou&s;e of Lords; and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Nuncio</HI>'s, not unlike our Hou&s;e of Commons. The <HI>Senators</HI> are the Bi&s;hops, <HI>Palatines, Ca|&s;tellans,</HI> and the Ten Great Officers of the Crown, in all about 142. In the Upper-Hou&s;e the <HI>Senators</HI> &s;it not by any Writ of Summons or Letters Patents as in <HI>England,</HI> but only by Virtue of the Great Preferments in
<PB N="6" REF="6">
the King's Gift, which they Enjoy for Life. So that the King wholly Con&s;titutes the Upper Hou&s;e; but the Lower are the Repre&s;entatives of the Gentry, Elected by them alone in their re&s;pective Provinces, without the Concur|rence of the Common People, who have no Priviledge to Vote in their Election. In&s;o|much, that at lea&s;t Nine Parts in Ten of the People of <HI>Poland</HI> are excluded from having any Share in the Government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Power.</NOTE> The Grand <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> is nothing el&s;e but the King, <HI>Senators,</HI> and Deputies a&s;&s;em|bled together in any Part of the Kingdom that his Maje&s;ty Commands. Without this great A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>States,</HI> the King can neither Make nor Repeal Laws, Declare War nor Conclude a Peace, make no Alliance with any Foreign Princes, rai&s;e neither Troops nor Taxes, Coin no Money; and, in a word, can Determine no Matter of State of any Impor|tance, without the Univer&s;al Con&s;ent and Concurrence of this Parliament, which they term the <HI>Free States of</HI> Poland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives for a mixt Go|vernment.</NOTE> Several powerful Motives have enclin'd the <HI>Poles</HI> to E&s;tabli&s;h this kind of mixt Government, which they take to be a ju&s;t Temperament of whatever is to be found mo&s;t Excellent in the &s;everal Monarchies, <HI>Ari&s;tocracies,</HI> and <HI>De|mocracies,</HI> that have been in the World. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which Motives, as I have met with them in their Hi&s;tories, or learn'd them from the mo&s;t knowing among their Natives, are as follows.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Motive.</NOTE> Fir&s;t, They think by this Judicious Choice of a Government, to pre&s;erve their King|dom from tho&s;e Di&s;orders which mo&s;t com|monly
<PB N="7" REF="6">
attend Ab&s;olute Monarchies: Agree|ing herein with that Prince of Philo&s;ophers, <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who though he preferr'd this kind of Government to all Others, yet was he ne|verthele&s;s obliged to own, that when ever it degenerated, it was the mo&s;t pernicious of all.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Poles</HI> have temper'd the Exorbi|tant Power of their Kings, with the mixture of two other Governments, whereby they thought to &s;ecure their Liberty, a Thing al|ways mo&s;t Dear to them, from the Arbitrary Will of a Prince, who by Imagining him|&s;elf above the Laws, might Fancy whatever his Pa&s;&s;ions prompted him to, allowable, and his true&s;t Intere&s;t to be the Entire Subjection of his People. The mi&s;erable Examples of their Neighbours, the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> have &s;ufficiently convinced them of this Truth; wherefore the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nation thought it but convenient to limit the exce&s;&s;ive Power of their Kings, and confine them to Rule with more Moderation and Ju|&s;tice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">II. Motive.</NOTE> Secondly, The <HI>Poles</HI> have ob&s;erv'd as well from their own Government, as from that of their Neighbours, that no &s;mall di&s;ad|vantage has flow'd from an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy.</HI> They could not be per&s;waded but that the Autho|rity of one Per&s;on was infinitely more ea&s;ie to be Tolerated than that of many; for that either the Ambition or Jealou&s;y of &s;uch would often di&s;turb the Repo&s;e and Tranquility of the Public. <HI>Poland</HI> al&s;o began to Reflect up|on its former Mi&s;eries under its <HI>Woievods,</HI> when it was deplorably rent and torn by the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Factions among tho&s;e Palatines: In&s;omuch that even while it became a Conqueror from without, it was vanqui&s;h'd within, and that by its own Force. This gave the <HI>Poles</HI> no &s;mall di&s;like to an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> which they have re&s;olved never more to admit among them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">III. Motive.</NOTE> The Third Rea&s;on of State, which has ob|liged the <HI>Poles</HI> to reject a <HI>Democracy,</HI> is, that they look upon that &s;ort of Government to be the mo&s;t dangerous of all, being the ea&s;ie&s;t enflam'd, and the greate&s;t Enemy to true Nobility. Its fir&s;t <HI>Maxim</HI> is, <HI>To procure a &V;niver&s;al Levelling, or making all alike;</HI> where|by, under the Notion of a common Liberty, they weaken and enervate tho&s;e great Geni|us's which were de&s;ign'd to Govern and Pro|tect them. How then could it be expected that the De&s;cendents of tho&s;e mighty War|riers who Founded the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nation, and have &s;o long maintain'd the Honour of it by their Valour, &s;hould &s;ubmit to have their Blood deba&s;ed, by mixing it with the Ignoble Vul|gar?</P>
<P>The Tyranny of Laws, which the Nobles are &s;ubjected to in an Ab&s;olute Common|wealth, would be too rude a Check to this Ambition which the <HI>Poles</HI> have always had to Command over their Va&s;&s;als, and therefore they have always entertain'd a &s;ecret <HI>Odium</HI> for tho&s;e <HI>Grecian</HI> Republics, that Bani&s;h'd their greate&s;t State&s;men, meerly becau&s;e they would not have them gain too fa&s;t upon the Affections of the People.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould perhaps doubt of the perni|cious Con&s;equences of a popular Government,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
where Rea&s;on does not &s;o much reign as an Unruly violence of a People, who know no other Laws than tho&s;e of their Pa&s;&s;ions; let them ca&s;t their Eyes on the Heats of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Empire, who were often ready to Over|turn the State, had not the Senate &s;peedily applied a prudent Remedy. But there are o|ther Examples more Modern, as the Revolt of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and the la&s;t Troubles in <HI>Bo|hemia.</HI> To the&s;e al&s;o may be added the Re|volutions of our own Nation in the Time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. when the Fury of the People ex|tended their Rage, even to the dipping their Hands in this Prince's Blood.</P>
<P>Politicians do generally own, that the People are a wild Bea&s;t, which ought rather to be led than left at Liberty, and by con|&s;equence have pronounced it mo&s;t Perilous to acquie&s;ce under their Subjection. An <HI>A|narchy</HI> would undoubtedly do more harm in a day, than a Tyrant could in all his Reign. If he Puni&s;hes, 'tis with &s;ome pre|tence of Ju&s;tice, when nothing can abate the Peoples Rage, but an utter Extinction of whatever is placed over their He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ds.</P>
<P>A mixt Government therefore made out of all the&s;e Three, is that which has proved mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Advan|tage of a mixt Go|vernment.</NOTE>Agreeable to the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nation, being a ju&s;t <HI>Medium</HI> between the dangerous Extremities of an Ab&s;olute Monarchy, and tho&s;e of <HI>Ari&s;to|cracy</HI> and <HI>Democracy.</HI> It is this the <HI>Poles</HI> have pitch'd upon as mo&s;t proper to pre&s;erve the public Liberty, and to perpetuate the Happi|ne&s;s of their State; being, it &s;eems, per&s;wa|ded that a Body Politic re&s;embles a Humane in this, that as the one borrows all its Vigour
<PB N="10" REF="8">
and Health from a Ju&s;t Temperament of the different Humours that compo&s;e it; &s;o the other depends ab&s;olutely on that of the Three before-mention'd Forms of Government. And moreover, as the former &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by the mutual Oppo&s;ition of contrary Qualities, &s;o the King, Senate and Gentry of <HI>Poland</HI> having in &s;ome mea&s;ure different Intere&s;ts and Incli|nations, are not only hinder'd from deviating into vicious Extremities, but al&s;o through a Noble Emulation are excited to labour care|fully for the Good of the Public.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divi&s;ion of the Repub|lic.</NOTE> The Republic is divided into Two <HI>States,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania;</HI> yet both which are but as one Body, having the &s;ame King, the &s;ame Par|liament, the &s;ame Laws, the &s;ame Privileges, the &s;ame Religion, and, as the natural re&s;ult of all the&s;e, the &s;ame Intere&s;t. The&s;e Two States are &s;o very well United, that a King cannot be Elected, a Law made, nor any State-Bu&s;ine&s;s done, without the mutual Con|&s;ent of both. But, <HI>My Lord,</HI> as the King is the Prime and Chief Member of this Re|public, I will give Your <HI>GRACE</HI> an Account of his pre&s;ent Power and Prerogatives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings pre|&s;ent Power and Prero|gatives.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> are too proud a Nation to agree with tho&s;e Politicians that mea&s;ure the Gran|deur of a Prince, and Happine&s;s of a <HI>State,</HI> by the De&s;potic Power of him that Governs it; and therefore tho&s;e pernicious Maxims of Tyrants, <HI>Si Lubet, Licet; Oderint dum Me|tuant,</HI> and the like, would be but ill receiv'd among a People that have all along &s;ecured their Liberties by their Prudence and Valour.
<PB N="11" REF="8">
This Va&s;&s;alage would &s;uit well enough with the Slaves of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> or with the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who all &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be govern'd like Bea&s;ts, and led by the No&s;e according to the different Caprice or Plea&s;ure of their Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Happi|ne&s;s.</NOTE> As for the Kings of <HI>Poland,</HI> they may re&s;t in &s;ecurity in the Bo&s;om of their Country, even amid&s;t the Noi&s;e of Arms, either with|out or within their Dominions, &s;ince they have always their Subjects to crowd about them for their Guards, thro' indi&s;pen&s;able Inclinations. For what contributes chiefly to the Happine&s;s of the&s;e Princes, is, the Loyal Ob&s;ervance and voluntary Obedience paid them even by tho&s;e that are at Liberty to do the contrary. I have often heard Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Polignac,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, &s;ay at <HI>War&s;aw, That he thought a King of</HI> Poland <HI>more Happy in his Per&s;on and Condition, than a King of</HI> France. Neverthele&s;s this Authority of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> is &s;o alloy'd by the Laws of the Land, that it does not exact more Vene|ration from the Nobles or Gentry, than they think he de&s;erves: For tho' their Behaviour be generally extraordinary Ob&s;ervant, yet do they tacitly &s;eem to call in que&s;tion the Power they have limited, and often refu&s;e that Duty which they have deem'd him wor|thy of by his Election.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unhappi|ne&s;s.</NOTE> The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility make no Difference between their King's Right, and tho&s;e of the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>Deputies,</HI> affirming, That &s;ince the&s;e three Members compo&s;e but one Body, they ought equally to &s;hare in the &s;ame Bene|fits and Injuries, and con&s;equently ought all

<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Illegi|timate as much &s;lighted.</NOTE> The King's Natural Sons are extreamly undervalu'd, and are hardly look'd upon to be Common Gentlemen; for none of the Gentry care to keep Company with them: Nay, one of the Late King's is a Clerk in the Salt Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e at <HI>Thorn,</HI> a City in <HI>Pru&s;|&s;ia,</HI> where his Place is not worth him above Thirty Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI> All over the Kingdom they u&s;ually have a very mean Opi|nion of Illegitimate Children, though Nature endows them generally with as many Perfecti|ons, and with as good Qualities, as &s;he does the Lawfully Begotten.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Means to continue the Crown in one Fa|mily.</NOTE> The only way for a King of <HI>Poland</HI> to con|tinue the Crown in his Family, is to be War|like; to enlarge his Dominions; to gain the Love and Affections of his People by his own Merits, and by the Favour of the Clergy; to &s;end his Children early to the Wars to get Credit and Reputation in the Army; to &s;pend Liberally all his Revenues, and to die in Debt, to the end that the <HI>Poles</HI> may be en|clin'd to Elect his Son, to enable him to pay what his Father ow'd. But all this while he mu&s;t never think to encroach on the Privi|leges of the Nation, nor endeavour by any means to render the Crown Hereditary; for whenever the <HI>Poles</HI> begin to &s;mell out any &s;uch private De&s;ign, they are pre&s;ently apt to &s;tir up Seditious Tumults, which would prove very Pernicious to all the Po&s;terity of that King, as the ill Succe&s;s the Late King's Sons have had &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates.</P>

Power; for the State of <HI>Denmark</HI> was quite different then from what that of <HI>Poland</HI> is now. In <HI>Denmark</HI> the King, Clergy, and Commonalty were under the Rule and Go|vernment of the Gentry, &s;o that it was the Intere&s;t of the Clergy and Commonalty to &s;ide with the King, to abate and depre&s;s the exce&s;&s;ive Power and Privileges of the Nobi|lity; which they &s;oon effected, by being Re|&s;olute and more in Number. But in <HI>Poland</HI> it is quite otherwi&s;e; for there the Clergy and Gentry have a common Intere&s;t, to keep the King and People in Subjection. The Cler|gy have great Privileges, and are very Rich. The Bi&s;hops for the mo&s;t part are Princes or Dukes; they are all Senators, and &s;it in the Diet before all the Temporal Lords; &s;o that by the great Authority and Veneration which they have procur'd to them&s;elves from the &s;la|vi&s;h People, they can hinder them from making any In&s;urrection; and by the Ar|bitrary and Free Power which they and the Gentry have hitherto maintain'd, to Elect whom they pleas'd for King, they will always keep him in &s;uch a Dependence for the &s;ake of his Children, that he &s;hall hardly ever be able to effect any De&s;ign upon their Prerogatives. Nay, providing he had found any Opportu|nity to compa&s;s &s;uch a dangerous Enterprize, yet would it not con&s;i&s;t with Prudence either to declare or Attempt it, for fear of Incurring the Hatred and Di&s;plea&s;ure of the People, which would not only tend to his own Ruin; but likewi&s;e Ob&s;truct the Election of any of his Family to the Throne after his Death; &s;o that the &s;ure&s;t way for a King of <HI>Poland</HI> to

Nay, their <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> is to be the fir&s;t Starter of all Laws, and when con|cluded upon, it is his Office only to read them before the Senate.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why pre|&s;erve their Kingdom elective.</NOTE> The others are, fir&s;t, That they take that Government to be ea&s;ie&s;t, which is executed by a Per&s;on whom they have unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to obey, being not thereby oblig'd to be &s;ubject to a Prince that Nature only has &s;et over their Heads.

If this be pre|tended to be remedy'd by a&s;&s;igning fit Tutors and Coun&s;ellors to the young Prince; They &s;ay, that the Government will be mi&s;erably mi&s;taken, for that we do not want in Hi&s;tory &s;everal Examples of young Kings, who have been driven out of their Thrones by their a&s;|&s;ign'd Governours: And moreover, that &s;el|dom any Kingdom has been known to conti|nue long in Peace, during the Minority of its King. The third Rea&s;on they give is, that in an elective State, rarely any Blood is &s;hed about the Succe&s;&s;ion, as has frequently hap|pen'd in other Countries, without fetching any Examples from Antiquity. Fourthly, They &s;ay, that a King cho&s;en by the free Con&s;ent of the People, will be likely, in common Gratitude, to retaliate the Obliga|tion by the Clemency and Ju&s;tice of his Reign. The fifth Advantage which the <HI>Poles</HI> pretend by an Election of their Kings is, that in no other State Princes take &s;o great Care to educate their Children, as in theirs.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Creation of a Gentle|man.</NOTE> The Manner of making a Gentleman is this. The King not being &s;ole &s;ufficient for that Purpo&s;e, he is oblig'd to &s;end to all the little <HI>Diets</HI> of the Kingdom for their Con&s;ent, which afterwards al&s;o mu&s;t be approv'd by the Great <HI>Diet,</HI> and then a Gentleman may have his <HI>Diploma,</HI> and be enroll'd.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three ways of forfeit|ing it.</NOTE> Al&s;o as Nobility is to be gain'd, &s;o likewi&s;e it may be forfeited three Ways: Fir&s;t, by &s;ome heinous Crime: For Example, where a Nobleman permits one that is Ignoble to u&s;urp his Coat of Arms.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In what Ca&s;e re&s;to|r'd.</NOTE> However, tho' Nobility may by the&s;e Means be lo&s;t and forfeited, yet many have been known to be re&s;tor'd where their Pa|rents had quitted their Quality thro' Poverty, the <HI>Poles</HI> ju&s;tly con&s;idering the Force of that Condition, which is able to drive Men to the mo&s;t Ignoble Actions.</P>

all under the &s;ame Parallel, and yet enjoy not the like Vigour and Health, and therefore mu&s;t proceed,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From their Diet, which as to Meat is generally fre&s;h roa&s;ted Fle&s;h (for they &s;carce ever eat any boyl'd or &s;alt) and Fowl, which encrea&s;es the volatile and fix'd Salts, and thence comes their Vigour and Vivacity.</P>
<P>Secondly, From their Drink, which is &s;piri|tuous and &s;trong, being chiefly <HI>Hungarian</HI> Wine burnt, or Ani&s;eed Water, both which they guzzle down in great Quantities almo&s;t all the Day long. The poorer Sort have a Liquor di&s;till'd from Wheat, Oats, or Bar|ley, which the Gentry rectifie with Anni&s;eeds or Aromaticks.</P>
<P>Thirdly, From their living hardily, for they hate Effeminacy, and a poor Country Cottage plea&s;es them as well as a Palace, and they frequently weave Tapi&s;try and Arras, as they travel along upon the Roads.</P>
<P>Nay, many of them will &s;leep in Time of Fro&s;t and Snow without any Bed or other Conveniency, and the little Children, two Months after they are born, have been &s;een carry'd about &s;tark naked.</P>
<P>Fourthly, from hunting, which is very much in U&s;e among them, and particularly of a wild Bea&s;t which they call <HI>Zubra,</HI> having no cloven Feet. They eat the&s;e Animals, which they find only in <HI>Lithuania.</HI> The <HI>Poles</HI> are ex|treamly addicted to, and expert in Hor&s;eman|&s;hip, which might probably occa&s;ion the Arms of <HI>Lithuania.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="101">
Fifthly, From other Exerci&s;es, for the <HI>Poles</HI> are very much enclin'd to Dancing, Leaping, Vaulting, Jumping, &amp;c. as likewi&s;e exceed|ingly given to Talking and Conver&s;ation, wherein they agree with the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, Their Beds, Fa&s;ting, and Tempe|rance in Eating, very much contribute towards their living long; for hard Beds knit their Bones, and Temperance refines their Spirits. The Slaves among them have no Beds, and the Ma&s;ters &s;eldom u&s;e any but Quilts, and the like.</P>
<P>And &s;eventhly, Their Health, Vigour, and Vivacity may rea&s;onably be augmented by their great Freedom and Privileges; for where Slavery hebetates and blunts the Mind, and con&s;equently enervates the Body, Liber|ty exhilerates the one, and by that means &s;trengthens the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com|plexion, Con&s;tituti|on, &amp;c.</NOTE> The Complexion of the <HI>Poles</HI> is generally enclining to fair, as likewi&s;e their Hair to a pale Yellowi&s;h Colour. Their Stature is commonly of the middle Sort, tho' a little tending to the talle&s;t. Their Con&s;titutions are generally good, and their Bodies gro&s;s, yet the Women of Quality make it their chief Study to make them&s;elves lean and &s;lim: But Painting and Wa&s;hes to meliorate their Complexions they abhor, neither have they any Occa&s;ion for them.</P>

This Sabre hangs by a Strap of Leather, to which is al&s;o fa&s;tened a Hankercheif, a Knife and Sheath, and a &s;mall Stone &s;et in Silver to whet their Knife upon. They wa&s;h their Faces and Necks eve|ry Morning in cold-Water, and the Fathers are accu&s;tom'd to make their Children to wa&s;h them&s;elves as &s;oon as they are &s;tirring, even in the &s;harpe&s;t Weather.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fur|ther Cha|racter.</NOTE> The <HI>Poles</HI> are generally open-hearted and hone&s;t (as <HI>Boterus</HI> ob&s;erves in his Relations) more apt to be deceiv'd than to deceive, and not &s;o ea&s;ily provok'd as appeas'd.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To what generaly apply them|&s;elves.</NOTE> The Adult among the Plebeians generally addict them&s;elves, the Men to Trade or Agriculture, and the Women to good Hou&s;e|wifry. The Gentry al&s;o apply them&s;elves to &s;erve the Church or State. Yet both Gentry and Commonalty are often given to Travel, and ea&s;ily imbibe the Idioms of foreign Nati|ons. Their Parts are &s;prightly and active, yet neverthele&s;s more apt for Imitation than Invention. Formerly the <HI>Poles</HI> were not much given to Trafick, but now, by the Ex|ample of their Neighbours who came to trade among them, they &s;trive to outvy each other in Riches and Covetou&s;ne&s;s; yet for the mo&s;t part they love to make a Show, and will ap|pear very &s;plendid upon the lea&s;t Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wor&s;t part of their Character.</NOTE> For the wor&s;t Part of their Character we mu&s;t ob&s;erve with <HI>Barclay,</HI> that they run mad after Liberty, and rather drive than in|vite their Kings to ob&s;erve their Laws. They not only hate the Name of Slavery, but likewi&s;e abhor a ju&s;t and hereditary Monar|chy. The Gentry claim prerogatives that

will &s;carce give them Leave to be guilty of any Crime, and whenever they happen to ac|knowledge any &s;uch, the Prince has &s;eldom a Power to puni&s;h it. They are not only li|centious in their Morals and a civil Life, but likewi&s;e in Religion and &s;acred Ob&s;ervances, for without Fear of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures, they will both talk and act as they plea&s;e again&s;t that Function, affirming them&s;elves &s;elf-&s;ufficient to be their own Guides in tho&s;e Matters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Genius how enclin'd.</NOTE> Their Genius enclines them generally to Arms, tho' they fall far &s;hort of their ancient Glory, by rea&s;on there are now &s;o few pub|lick &s;pirited Per&s;ons among them, each ha|ving greater Regard to his own private Inte|re&s;t and Gain, than either the Honour or Safety of his Country.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enur'd to Hard&s;hip.</NOTE> It is probable they would be almo&s;t invin|cible were they but well Di&s;ciplin'd, for they are &s;o inur'd to Hard&s;hip, that they look up|on even the <HI>Germans</HI> to be an Effeminate Sort of People, not fitting to &s;upport the Fatigues of War, and the Rigour of Weather.

In the Mornings both Men and Women generally drink Ginger, Yolks of Eggs and Sugar boyl'd in Beer. They are immoderate Lovers of Pig roa&s;ted, tho' their Sauces have commonly an odd Ta&s;te. The Great Men &s;eldom dine without a Di&s;h of Peas and yellow ru&s;ty Bacon &s;lic'd, which it &s;eems they prefer. They eat all manner of Mu&s;hrooms, not excepting tho&s;e that cleave to the Trees, which they gather and dry, to pre&s;erve them. Tho&s;e of above a Nights Growth, we commonly e&s;teem Poy&s;on, and which perhaps may be &s;o here and not there, no more than Poppy Seeds, which they like|wi&s;e eat in great Quantities, for they drink the Milk of them, as al&s;o make it into &s;everal

Their Sauces al&s;o differ extreamly from ours; &s;ome whereof are yellow and made with Saffron; others white, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of Cream; a third Sort grey, being of Onyons; and a fourth black, being made with the Juice of Plums. Into the&s;e Sauces they put a great Quantity of Sugar, or &s;ometimes Pepper, Cynamon, and &s;ometimes Ginger, Cloves, Nutmeg, Olives, Capers, Kernels of Pine Apples, and Prunes.

They al&s;o have a broad Piece of &s;tarch'd Lin|nen to &s;erve for Napkins, &s;ow'd round the Table Cloath for fear it &s;hould be &s;tollen away. The Gue&s;ts being &s;et down at Table, immediately the Gates of the Hou&s;e are &s;hut, and are not open'd till all the Company are ri&s;en, and the Plate taken Account of and lock'd up; for &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, the Footmen are generally &s;o light-finger'd, that they would infallibly <HI>Nim</HI> &s;ome of it, and this is the Rea&s;on al&s;o why they do not lay Spoons, Knives and Forks on the Table.</P>

a part for Fea&s;ts and Entertainments. Here there is a Place made up with Balla&s;ters for the Side-board Table, from which the Cloath is never taken till it is very dirty, being al|ways loaded with a great Quantity of Plate. Over this Place there is a Gallery for Mu&s;ick, u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ting of Violins and Organs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Particulars of Servants.</NOTE> Tho&s;e that are invited, always bring their Footmen along with them, to whom, as &s;oon as they are &s;eated, they cut half their Bread, and as much Meat, and give it over their Shoulders. This Servant being thus provided, &s;tands and eats what is given him behind his Ma&s;ter. If the Ma&s;ter asks twice for Wine, the Servant brings him as much again, and, after his Ma&s;ter, drinks out of the &s;ame Gla&s;s without rincing. Altho' there are great Quantities of Victuals brought from the Kitchin, yet do they rarely carry any back, for the Servants immediately &s;eize on what is left, and their Ladies make them car|ry each of them a Napkin to prog for dry'd Sweet-meats or Fruit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners at Table.</NOTE> After the Cloath is taken away, the <HI>Poles</HI> are accu&s;tom'd to &s;it a good while drinking. The Genteele&s;t Part of them, at lea&s;t, have a very decent way of eating. They never once touch the Meat with their Hands, but carve with &s;o great <HI>Addre&s;s,</HI> that they dex|terou&s;ly cut a Partridge into &s;ix Parts in a Trice, holding it on the End of a Fork. While they are eating they mind nothing el&s;e, and tho' any body &s;ends in for them, they never &s;tir from Table till they have done.

After their Meals they generally take a Pipe of Tobacco, as the Cu&s;tom is with us and other Countries, the Manner whereof may not be unplea&s;ant to be related.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> way of taking Tobacco.</NOTE> They generally &s;moak Tobacco without injuring either their Heads or Stomachs, and that by the&s;e Means: They have a Pipe &s;tuck thro' a little round Box, into which they have before put Sponge that had been &s;oak'd in di&s;till'd Vineger; this Sponge, by means of a few little Holes thro' the Pipe, commu|nicates its Mildne&s;s to the Smoak, and be|&s;ides &s;ucks away all the Oyl of the Tobacco, whereby the Heat is exceedingly lenify'd, and the Plea&s;ure of &s;moaking con&s;equently im|prov'd. When they would render &s;moaking Tobacco yet more agreeable over and above this lenifying the Heat, they have a way of per&s;uming the Smoak, by placing another Box of a le&s;&s;er Size than the former, nearer to the Bowl of the Pipe, wherein they are wont to put Cotton dipt into &s;ome Sort of E&s;&s;ence, which by means of the like Holes made as before within that Box, and thro' the Pipe tran&s;mits its odoriferous Quality to the Smoak.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of Inns.</NOTE> Tho&s;e Inns, or rather long Stables, are all built up with Boards, and cover'd with Straw.
<PB N="220" REF="116">
Within there is no Furniture, neither are there any Windows, but all the Light comes in either at Holes made by the Weather, or the Crevices of ill join'd Boards. 'Tis true, at the further End they have a little Chamber with a Fire-Hearth, but then there is no lodging in it, becau&s;e of the Flyes, Fleas, Bugs, and e&s;pecially the noi&s;om Smells that incommode it; for if they happen to have a little Window there, yet do they never open it tho' the Weather be never &s;o hot; &s;o that Strangers choo&s;e rather to lye in the afore&s;aid Stable, where the <HI>Go&s;podarz</HI> or Inn-Keeper lodges him&s;elf with his whole Family, than to be &s;uffocated by the Stink and Smell of &s;o clo&s;e and &s;mall a Room. In the long Room likewi&s;e there is an intolerable Smell, occa&s;i|on'd by a Parcel of rotten Cabbages, which tho&s;e People always keep by them: And this, tho' it may be agreeable enough to the Na|tives who are us'd to it, yet to Strangers it mu&s;t needs be very offen&s;ive.</P>

<P>Sixthly, No Part of <HI>Poland</HI> produces &s;o much Honey, for here almo&s;t every Tree contains a Swarm of Bees. It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o, that the Honey of this Country is more free from Wax than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now entertain your Lord&s;hip with a few remarkable Cu&s;toms in Husbandry pe|culiar to the&s;e two Countries, and wherein I will be as brief as I am &s;en&s;ible that Art is not much either known or e&s;teem'd, being ap|propriated
<PB N="233" REF="122">
chiefly to vulgar Conditi|ons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners in Husbandry.</NOTE> It may be ob&s;erv'd, that the&s;e People plow, &s;ow, and harrow, all at the &s;ame Time, and that their Ground having been but once fecundated with burning, will bear great Crops &s;even or eight Years together without dunging. When they burn the Woods on the Lands, if they meet with high Trees, they do not cut them down, but only prune off their &s;ide Branches, &s;o that the Sun may not be kept from the Ground, the manner of doing which is uncommon, for one Pea&s;ant will prune above a thou&s;and Trees together without &s;o much as once coming down.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange way of Pruning Trees.</NOTE> To effect this, he provides him&s;elf of a Seat of Rope, much like a Stirrup, the which he fa&s;tens to a long Cord, and having ca&s;t it over an Arm of the Tree, a Boy that is on the Ground draws him up and down, and when he has &s;o done, by Help of another Cord, ea&s;ily transfers him to the next Tree. This Pea&s;ant has always a Hook by his Side, with which he u&s;es to lop off the Branch|es.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peculiar manner of Sowing.</NOTE> They have moreover another odd and pe|culiar Way of &s;owing in the&s;e Countries, which is by mixing two Parts of Barley with one of VVheat, and putting them into the Ground together in the Spring, whereby it happens, that the Barley may be mow'd on
<PB N="234" REF="123">
one Harve&s;t, and the VVheat reap'd the next. This VVheat being trod down by tho&s;e that mow the Barley, the next Harve&s;t commonly comes up &s;o thick and high, that there is &s;carce any pa&s;&s;ing thro' it for Fear of being &s;tifled.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways of or|dering Corn.</NOTE> In Time of VVar the&s;e Boors have a VVay of &s;ecuring their Corn, &amp;c. by burying it in a Place made up under Ground with Po&s;ts and Bark of Trees for that Purpo&s;e. Their Way of ordering their Corn is al&s;o extraordinary, for they fir&s;t dry it with Smoak before they lay it up in their Graneries, by which means it will keep good for &s;everal Years toge|ther.</P>

the people; and the&s;e flow chiefly from the Officers, and fir&s;t from the General's being perpetual, the King being often oblig'd to give that great Charge to a rich Noble|man, that knows little or nothing of War|like matters, yet when he has once be&s;tow'd it, he cannot recall his Grant, tho' he fore|&s;ee never &s;o many ill Con&s;equences that at|tend it; &s;o that it is no wonder if <HI>Poland</HI> often makes fal&s;e &s;teps in Martial Affairs, when it has frequently &s;o unexperienc'd a Guide. On the contrary, if this high Com|mand were only conferr'd on, and conti|nu'd to Merit, what wonders might not the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Cavalry be able to perform? for be|ing &s;o va&s;t a number of Hor&s;e, they might ea&s;ily hem in and Cut off the greate&s;t Bo|dy of Foot, of which the Armies of their Enemies chiefly Con&s;i&s;t. Another inconve|nience proceeds from the ill Conduct and Remi&s;sne&s;s of the under Officers, the grea|te&s;t whereof is that, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Gentry, &s;eldom come to the place of Ren|dezvouz, till a Month or &s;ix Weeks after the time appointed, and this neither the King nor General dares offer to remedy, for fear of di&s;obliging that &s;erviceable Body. In like manner the Gentry are &s;ometimes accu|&s;tom'd to leave the Army a Month before the Campaign is ended, which grievance is al&s;o not to be redre&s;s'd without danger. The cau&s;e of their being &s;o tardy in appearing, is in a great mea&s;ure to be Attributed to the defective Orders given them; for when the Officers are Commanded to March to &s;uch or &s;uch a place in the Kingdom, nei|ther
<PB N="23" REF="136">
the time they are to march in, nor the Towns they are to pa&s;s through, are com|prehended, &s;o that by the&s;e means they are at liberty, to delay on account of their own private Bu&s;ine&s;s, as much as they plea&s;e, or el&s;e, to wander all over the Kingdom, either for their Profit or Plea&s;ure; whereby the Country they March through is not a little damag'd, and the be&s;t laid De&s;igns of the Army fru&s;trated by their Ab&s;ence. Another Inconvenience ari&s;ing from the Officers, is, That they employ &s;o much Money in fitting them&s;elves out with co&s;tly Arms, and &s;plen|did Equipage&punc; that for want of timely Pay, they have &s;eldom any thing left, in a little time, to &s;upport their Nece&s;&s;ities: Which De|fect they are wont to make up, by oppre&s;&s;ing the People after an unrea&s;onable manner.

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TRADE has ever been ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd &s;o nece&s;&s;ary towards the Support and Grandeur of any <HI>State,</HI> that no Nation in the World has hitherto been found &s;o Stupid, as to be without it. Some Countries indeed, have wholly confin'd it to the limits of their own Dominions, but how much they have been in the wrong, may appear from the va&s;t advantages which Foreign Commerce has brought to other Nations. <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol|land</HI> are &s;ufficient Demon&s;trations of this A&s;|&s;ertion, who, during the late War, have been thereby able to contribute &s;o largely towards the oppo&s;ing a Potent Monarch, who other|wi&s;e might have been &s;o far from affording
<PB N="35" REF="142">
&s;uch wonderful Conce&s;&s;ions, as we have ob|tain'd by the late happy Peace, that he might rather, in all Probability, have over-run the greate&s;t part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> not much en|clined to Trade, and why.</NOTE> As for the Trade of <HI>Poland,</HI> my <HI>Lord,</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> are but little addicted to indu&s;try of that kind, the Gentry being ab&s;olutely forbid it on the forfeiture of their Honour, and the Commonalty for the mo&s;t part wanting Funds &s;ufficient to promote it; therefore, what Trade they have is chiefly follow'd by Foreign Merchants. Be&s;ides, tho&s;e of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who have the be&s;t Fortunes, generally &s;pend too much of their Revenues in co&s;tly Habits and Luxury to be able to undergo any con&s;idera|ble matters in Traffick. Al&s;o this Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> is not in the lea&s;t commodious for &s;uch an undertaking, it not having any con|&s;iderable Port, that of <HI>Dantzic</HI> only excepted, which would &s;uffice for the exotick Trade of &s;o va&s;t a Country. Hence it follows, that what Commodities are tran&s;ported into Foreign Countries are &s;o very incon&s;ide|rable, that tho' they are of &s;everal &s;orts, and of general u&s;e, yet being counterpois'd by the incredible quantity, and richer variety of foreign Merchandize, they &s;carce &s;uffice for Balance to the Cloth, Silk, Jewels, Tape&s;try, Fruit, Spice, Salt-Fi&s;h, Wine, Tin, Steel, &amp;c. Imported from <HI>England, Flanders, Portugal, Spain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commidi|ties Expor|ted and Im|ported.</NOTE> <HI>Starovol&s;cius</HI> enumerates the divers particu|lars Exported and Imported, wherein it may not be improper to follow him. He &s;ays, that over and above tho&s;e already mentioned,
<PB N="36" REF="143">
there are likewi&s;e rich Furrs, Gold and Sil|ver, both wrought and unwrought, and great variety of Kick&s;haws and Delicacies Import|ed, and as for what are Exported, they are Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rie, Millet, and all &s;orts of Grain and Pul&s;e, Wooll, Hemp, Flax, Hops, a &s;ort of Herb for Dying, Hides, Tallow, Tann'd Leather, Furrs brought out of <HI>Mu&s;ao|vy,</HI> but dre&s;t here, and tran&s;ported from hence. Likewi&s;e <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Furrs, Honey, Wax, Amber, Pitch, Pot-a&s;hes, Ma&s;ts, Planks, and &s;everal Materials both for Shipwrights and other Builders. <HI>Poland</HI> al&s;o exports, Salt, Beer, Opium, Vitriol, Nitre, <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> Vermil|lion, Bra&s;s, Lead, Iron, Copper, Pit-Coal, Gla&s;s, and Earthen Ware. Moreover it &s;up|plies the Neighbouring Countries with Hor&s;es very much coveted for their &s;wiftne&s;s, hardi|ne&s;s, and ea&s;y pace. It al&s;o furni&s;hes other Nations with va&s;t numbers of Oxen, Sheep, Hogs, &amp;c. with which it greatly abounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">But little Money, and why.</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Exportations, yet as I &s;aid before, the Trade of <HI>Poland</HI> is over|balanc'd by Foreign Commodities, whence it comes to pa&s;s, that there is but little Money to be met with in that Kingdom. What &s;mall matters the Merchants receive for their Goods at <HI>Dantzic,</HI> they generally give to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> &amp;c. for Wine; neverthele&s;s, they have &s;ome Foreign Coin, and &s;ome of their own &s;tirring among&s;t them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coin mo&s;t current in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> That which is mo&s;t current in the King|dom, is either all of Copper, or Copper mixt with Silver, tho' they have likewi&s;e &s;ome few Silver and Gold Coins of their own. The

two fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;orts are the mo&s;t common, and which are always Coined in &s;uch &s;mall pieces, that it is very trouble&s;ome either re|ceiving or paying out any Sum.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contributes to Poverty.</NOTE> This ba&s;e <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Coin contributes very much towards the Poverty of this Kingdom. It was introduc'd on Account of Nece&s;&s;ity, when the <HI>Poles</HI> had no Money to pay their Army, which began to Confederate, and join in a <HI>Roko&s;z,</HI> for want of it. It is not likewi&s;e of late Days that this Coin has been introduced, for the Officers of <HI>Ca&s;imir</HI> III. are &s;aid to have coin'd it; and which was af|terwards grievou&s;ly exclaim'd again&s;t at the <HI>Diet</HI> held at <HI>Petrikow,</HI> in the Year 1459, un|der the Reign of <HI>Ca&s;imir</HI> the Great. In tho&s;e Days, it &s;eems, the Kings had a Power to coin Money; and the fir&s;t that re&s;ign'd his Right to the Republick, was <HI>Sigi&s;mond</HI> III. in the Year 1632.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Coins.</NOTE> The next of their Coins are called <HI>Chou|&s;tacks,</HI> being &s;mall pieces of Silver of ba&s;e alloy, whereof three make a <HI>Tinfe,</HI> which is al&s;o a &s;ort of Silver Money of ba&s;e Alloy.

As for Gold Coins, <HI>Ca&s;imir</HI> the Great was the fir&s;t that caus'd any to be &s;tamp'd in <HI>Poland,</HI> but of which, either Coin'd by that King or his Succe&s;&s;ors, there are few now made u&s;e of, the Silver and Gold Coins that have any Currency in the Kingdom, being for the mo&s;t part Foreign. Tho&s;e of Gold are <HI>Ducats,</HI> which are worth two <HI>French</HI> Crowns, or two <HI>German</HI> Rixdollars. Tho&s;e of Silver are generally of the <HI>German</HI> Coin.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> not very rich, and why.</NOTE> Tho' it may hereby appear, that the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Wealth is not over con&s;iderable, yet &s;ays <HI>Sta|rovol&s;cius,</HI> it has always been &s;ufficient to de|fray the Expences of the Kingdom, without the help of any Neighbours, tho' the &s;ame Author afterwards gives this Character of his Countrymen; that they are not over rich by rea&s;on of their &s;ending the greate&s;t part of their Commodities abroad, and generally re|ceiving nothing in return, but &s;uch as &s;erve to &s;upport Luxury, and encourage Vice. <HI>Hauteville</HI> gives another rea&s;on why the <HI>Poles</HI> may not be &s;o rich as formerly, which is, becau&s;e of the many and frequent Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Mu&s;covites, Turks, Co&s;acks,</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> into this Kingdom, who were accu&s;tomed to carry off great num|bers into &s;lavery, and thereby to di&s;-people the Country; al&s;o by rea&s;on of the many bloody Wars, and &s;weeping Pe&s;tilencies which this Country has undergone.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerning Salt.</NOTE> The Spaces, or Allies, which I there took notice of are form'd by rows of large Pillars cut out of the Salt to keep the Earth from fal|ing in, and which, by reflection of the Light make a very agreeable Pro&s;pect, &s;eem|ing &s;o many Rows of &s;parkling Chry&s;tal. The Salt is taken out of the&s;e Mines in huge Ma&s;|&s;es, and laid in heaps all about the entrance, whence it is tran&s;ported in Carriages through|out the whole Kingdom, except <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> only, where <HI>French</HI> Salt is alone made u&s;e of. This Salt is ground in Mills like Corn. The Gen|try of this Kingdom have a right to any of the&s;e Mines, as likewi&s;e to tho&s;e of any Me|tals found upon their Lands; there being by the Con&s;titutions no Royal Mines in <HI>Poland,</HI> except tho&s;e of white Salt only, which belong peculiarly to the King.</P>

In this, and in other re&s;pects, the <HI>Poles</HI> are very negligent of their own Intere&s;t, being content to pay great rates for Cloth and Paper, when they might ea&s;ily have both of their own Manufacture.</P>

The <HI>Poles</HI> Trade very much in fre&s;h Fi&s;h among&s;t them&s;elves, and the manner of their Fi&s;hing, I imagine, may not be unacceptable to your <HI>Excellency,</HI> having &s;omething peculiar in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Fi&s;hing.</NOTE> Their Lakes and Fi&s;h-ponds in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania</HI> being generally &s;o large, that it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible ever to drain them, They u&s;ually choo&s;e to Fi&s;h them in Winter when they are all frozen up. They fir&s;t make a great hole in the Ice to let down their Nets, and afterwards &s;everal little ones from place to place, that they may draw them along from hole to hole with a Rope fa&s;t|ned to a long Pole, till they bring them back to the fir&s;t large opening; When the two ends of the Nets are brought together, they pull them up, and bring out with them all the Fi&s;h that happen to be within the &s;pace of Water thro' which the Nets were drawn, for they cannot po&s;&s;ibly leap over them, becau&s;e of the Ice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Honey, and its Produce.</NOTE> Throughout all <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> there are huge quantities of Honey to be found in the Woods, either in hollow Trees, holes of the Ground, or any where el&s;e that the Bees can find to &s;ettle in.

Neighbouring Countries. Now is it not a great wonder, that the&s;e Bees can produce &s;o great plenty of Honey in &s;o Cold a Climate?
