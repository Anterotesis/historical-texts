<P>Whereupon the Sea Royali&s;ts began to mutiny a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, and at the la&s;t fell into &s;uch an a|gony and pa&s;&s;ion, That they encountered each other, fought re&s;olutely, di&s;puting their <HI>Decks</HI> with halfe Pikes, Mu&s;quets, Swords, and other Warlike weapons, killing neer vpon twenty, and wounded many, throw|ing them over &s;hip-board into the Sea.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration of the further proceedings of the Treaty, between his Majesty and the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>the Commi&s;&s;ioners of parl. for them&s;elves and attendants are putto a very large expence of money, which is nece&s;&s;arily required for the carrying on this great and publike employment, and therefore do de&s;ire the parliament to &s;upply them with the re|mainder of the 10000. <HI>l.</HI> with convenient &s;peed. As for the begining and &s;ome dayes progre&s;&s;e in the Treaty you may be plea&s;ed to take notice of the pa&s;&s;ages between his Maje&s;ty, and the parliaments Commi&s;&s;ioners, meeting in the Treaty Chamber the 18 of this in|&s;tant Septem. in the Forenoon little bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was di&s;patcht, onely the Commi&s;&s;ion read of the parliaments Commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;ome introduction made into the Propo&s;itions, after which his Maje&s;ty went to dinner and met the Commi&s;&s;ioners again in the afternoon and after they were &s;et,</P>
<P>The Commi&s;. proceeded to this effect. <HI>May it plea&s;e your Maie&s;ty, Having made known our Commi&s;&s;ions to treat per&s;o|nally with your Maj. upon the propo&s;itions formerly pre&s;ented at</HI> Hampton-Court, <HI>as they concern the Kingdoms of</HI> England <HI>&amp;</HI> Ireland. <HI>And this Treaty to be for</HI> 40 <HI>days, beginning this pre|&s;ent, and to proceed in the fir&s;t place upon the propo&s;itions fol|lowing in order, viz. For recalling all Oaths, Declarations, &amp;c. And to receive your Maj. An&s;wer in writing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then his Mai. de&s;ired nothing to be binding, but what &s;hould be agreed upon in writing, which was a&s;sented to.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Commi&s;&s;ioners then de&s;ired his Maiesty to give his Roy|all a&s;sent to this propo&s;ition in&s;uing, That whereas both Hou&s;es of Parliament have bin nece&s;&s;itated to undertake a war in their ju&s;t and lawfull defence, &amp;c. An Act of parliament may pa&s;se, whereby all Oaths, Declarations, &amp;c. again&s;t both or either hou|&s;es, or again&s;t any for adhering unto them, &amp;c. to be declared null, and that publikely intimated in all pari&s;h Churches in all your Maie&s;ties Dominions of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Ireland.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P> Then his Maje&s;ty de&s;ired to have the Propo&s;itions of the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h intirely together.</P>
<P>To which the Commi&s;&s;ioners an&s;wered, <HI>That the Propo&s;i|tions them&s;elves were formerly pre&s;ented to your Maiesty at Hampton Court we conceive are in your Maiesties hands, ex|cepting that of the Court of Wards, delivered &s;ince in the I&s;le of</HI> Wight, <HI>&amp;c. what concerns our in&s;tructions we &s;hall doe; but we have no warrant from our Hou&s;es to do that.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And to the latter part of the &s;econd paper delivered in the morning, we &s;hall acquaint the Hou&s;es, that no agreement put in writing, be binding till the conclu&s;ion of the whole Treaty, unle&s;se it &s;hall be otherwi&s;e e&s;pecially agreed.</HI></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day Septemb. 19. the King and the Commi&s;&s;io|ners met again in the &s;ame order that they had done the day before, and treated both forenoon and afternoon.</P>
<P>None of them do go to the King at all, but in the Treaty Chamber, and altogether publikely, where there are made gallant &s;peeches.</P>
<P>And the 19. Sep. his Maje&s;ty brought in a paper to this effect.</P>

<OPENER><SIGNED>CHARLES R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>In an&s;wer to your proceedings the 18 Sep. concerning the recalling of all the Oaths, Declarations and Proclamations heretofore had, or to be had, again&s;t both or either Hou&s;es of Parliament, or again&s;t any for adhering unto them, or for doing, or executing any Office, place or charge by any au|thority derived from them: And all Judgments, Indite|ments. Outlawries and Inqui&s;itions in any of the &s;aid Cau|&s;es, and all Grants thereupon, made or. hnd to be made or had, be declared null, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and forbidden, and that this be publikely intimated in all Pari&s;h Churches, and other places needfull within his Maje&s;ties Dominions of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty concerning that expre&s;&s;ion that both Hou|&s;es
<PB REF="4">of Parliament have been nece&s;&s;itated to undertake a war for their ju&s;t defence, which &s;eemes to lay the blame of the bloud &s;pilt on his Maje&s;ty; therefore his Maje&s;ty de&s;ires that part may be referred to be treated on la&s;t.</P>

<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners then put in a paper to this effect. <HI>For our giving the Propo&s;itions intirely together, we find not our &s;elves warranted to pre&s;ent our de&s;ires concerning all the Pro|po&s;itions at once, or in any &s;ort to treat them but in Order, but what we have drawn out for our own u&s;e, wee &s;hall give your Maiesty to expedite the Treaty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And this draught is &s;eparated from what concernes the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P><HI>And this we do not in way of Treaty, but out of de&s;ire to &s;a|tis&s;te your Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VVe humbly de&s;ire your Majesties An&s;wer to our paper deli|vered yesterday concerning the Propo&s;ition for recalling all Oaths, &amp;c. and other proceedings thereupon against the</HI> Parlia|ment, <HI>or tho&s;e that acted by their Authority.</HI></P>
<P>So that the bu&s;ine&s;s that thus holds in Di&s;pute is, about the matter of the fault, upon whom the guilt of the bloud &s;hed in the&s;e wars &s;hall be laid, and how as to freeing his Maje&s;ty, which his Maje&s;ty would have done, and about this the Commi&s;&s;ioners have written to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There is as yet nothing denyed by the King to be pa&s;&s;ed; though nothing actually granted. But the great rub is not yet removed.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty is loath to charge him&s;elfe with the guilt of the bloud &s;pilt. The Commi&s;&s;ioners are very faithfull to their In&s;tructions.</P>

<P>THis morning his Maje&s;ty came &s;omewhat early to the Treaty, and &s;itting in the Chair of State at the up|per end of the Table, He ro&s;e up, and made a Speech to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of both Hou&s;es, intimating, <HI>That it was His Majesties gracious will and plea&s;ure to pa&s;se an Act, for ju&s;tifying the proceedings of Parliament in the late War, and for declaring all Oaths, Declarations, Proclamations, and other proceedings again&s;t it to be void, to the end, that no obstruction what&s;oever, may hinder or indanger this ble&s;sed work in hand, that &s;o all differences may be compo&s;ed, all jealou|&s;ies removed, and the peace of this langui&s;hing Kingdom firmly &s;etled and united.</HI></P>
