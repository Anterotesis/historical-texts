And though Mr. <HI>Bullocke</HI> be pleased to under-rate at it halfe the crowne the bushell, which in the Canaries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill yeeld ten and twelve shillings, and in Spaine eight, yet even in that proporti|on you are recompenced with six, seven, or eight pound the Acre, of which two men by a discreet division of their time, will plow, reape, and in at the least 60 Acres.</P>
<P>Which though it may appeare a matter of admiration, yet I shall easily make it apparant by the following Narration, in which such is the exactnesse of the Ayre in this Country, that you may have five successive Harvests of the same grain in different seasons. For though a man and a boy with much ease may plow an Acre every day, the ground being pliable of a rich blacke and tender mold, and no frosts or snowes, no usuall droughts or raines to hinder the going of the plow, yet I shall allow a month for the plowing of twelve Acres, and thus plowing in September, October, November, December, and January, you may have your severall Harvests in June, July, Au|gust, and September, which may easily bee inned by the same hands the labour not falling in a glut upon them, but the Corne ripening according to its severall seasons.</P>
<P>And thus by two mens labours onely you have a gratefull re|turne of at the least three hundred and sixty Quarters of Wheat, which will at that under rate formerly mentioned, <HI>viz</HI> 2s. 6d. yeeld so many pounds sterling: Nor is there such difficulty in the threshing, as may be at first sigh't suspected, since it may easily be tread out with Oxen, as it is usuall in Italy and other Countries.</P>
<P>The first Wheat being reaped, if you desire a croppe of Barley, the same Land plowed in <HI>Iuly,</HI> will returne its ripe increase in <HI>September,</HI> so that from one and the same piece of ground you may have the benefit of two different Harvests.</P>
<P>But the Rice (for production of which this Countrey is no lesse proper then those Lands which have the greatest reputation of fer|tility) sowed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eelds a greater encrease with the same labour 40 A|cres

of this plowed if valued but at 7s. 6d. the Bushell, will yeeld 600l. all done by two men and a Teame of Oxen, who may by other labour in the intervall betwixt the committing the seed to ground, and its ripening, fall upon Cole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">seed or Rape-seed, infinitely rich Commodities with the same facility.</P>
<P>The objection, that the Countrey is overgrowne with Woods, and consequently not in many Yeares to bee penetrable for the Plough, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ies a great feeblenesse with it. For there are an im|mense quantity of Indian fields cleared already to our hand by the Natives, which till wee grow over populous may every way be a|bundantly sufficient, but that the very clearing of ground carries an extraordinary benefit with it, I wil make apparent by these follow|ing Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. If wee consider the benefit of Pot-ashes growne from ten to fifty pound the Tunne, within these twenty yeares, and in all proba|bility likely to encrease by reason of interdicting Trade betwixt us and the Muscovite, from whence we used to supply our selves; We shall finde the employment of that very Staple will raise a conside|rable summe of Money, and no man so imployed can (if industri|ous) make his labour lesse then one hundred pound, <HI>per annum</HI>: For if wee consider that those who labour about this in England give twelve pence the bushell for Ashes, if wee consider to how many severall parts of the Countrey they are compelled to send man and horse before they can procure any quantity to fall to worke u|pon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if wee consider some of the thriftiest, and wise, and under|standing men, fell Wood on purpose for this Commodity, and yet notwithstanding this Brigade of difficulties finde their Adventures and Labours answered with a large returne of profit, wee who have all these things, already at our owne doore without cost, may with a confidence grounded upon reason expect an advantage much grea|ter, and a clearer profi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Nor can wee admit in discretion, that a large qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntity of those should not finde a speedy Market, since the decay of Tymber is a de|fect growne universall in Europe, and the Commodity such a neces|sary S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aple, that no civill Nation can be conveniently without it.</P>
<P>Nor are Pipestaves and Clapboard a despicable commodity, of which one man may with ease make fifteene thousand yearely, which in the countrey it selfe are sold for 4l. in the <HI>Canaries</HI> for
<PB N="5" REF="11">
twenty pound the thousand, and by this meanes the labour of one man will yeeld him 60l. <HI>per annum,</HI> at the lowest Market. If all this be not sufficient to remove the incumbrance of Woods, the Saw mill may be taken into consideration, which is in every respect highly beneficiall by this Timber for building houses, and shipping may be more speedily prepared, and in greater quantity by the la|bour of two or three men, then by a hundred hands after the usuall manner of sawing.</P>
<P>The Plankes of Walnut-trees for Tables or Cubbords, Cedar and Cypresse, for Chests, Cabinets, and the adorning magnificent buil|dings, thus prepared will be easily transported into England, and sold at a very considerable value.</P>
<P>But that in which there will be an extraordinary use of our Woods is the Iron mills, which if once erected will be an unde|caying Staple, and of this forty servants will by their labour raise to the Adventurer foure thousand pound yearely: Which may ea|sily be apprehended if wee consider the deerenesse of Wood in En|gland, where notwithstanding this great clog of difficulty, the Master of the Mill gaines so much yearely, that he cannot but reckon himselfe a provident Saver.</P>
<P>Neither does <HI>Virginia</HI> yeeld to any other Province whatsoever in excellency and plenty of this Oare: And I cannot promise to my selfe any other then extraordinary successe and gaine, if this noble and usefull Staple be but vigourously followed.</P>
<P>And indeed it had long ere this growne to a full perfection, if the treachery of the Indians had not crushed it in the beginning, and the backwardnesse of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Merchants to reerect it, hindred that Countrey from the benefit arising from that universall Staple.</P>
<P>But to shew something further, what use may be made of Woods besides the forementioned Wallnut Oyle, at the least a fourth part of the Trees in <HI>Viginia</HI> being of that <HI>species,</HI> is an excellent Staple, and very gainefull to the industrious Labourer.</P>
<P>Nor is it a contemptible profit that may be made of Woods, if by boaring holes in divers trees, of whose vertues wee are yet ig|norant, and collecting the juce thereof, a scrutiny be made which are fit for Medicinall Liquor and Balsomes; which for Gummes, Perfumes, and Dyes, and heere I may justly take occasion to com|plaine of our owne sloth and indulgence, if compared to the labo|rious

<P>The French relations of their Voyages to <HI>Canada,</HI> tell us, that the Indians and themselves falling into a contagious disease, of which Phisitians could give no Reason or Remedy, they were all in a short space restored to their health meerely by drinking water, in which Saxifrage was infused and boyld, which was then discovered to them by the Natives, and wee justly entertaine beliefe that many excellent Medicines either for conservation of Nature in her vigour or restauration in her decadence may be communicated unto us, if projection of this stampe be so much incouraged by hopes of re|ward or honour, as to be put in practice.</P>
<P>By this Improvement of Woods, the Ground comming to bee cleared, wee have a soile fit to produce what ever is excellent in Na|ture, the Vine and Olive which Naturally simpathize together, will thrive beyond beliefe, nor need it be any interruption to Tillage, since the Vintage and Harvest alwayes fall but in different Reasons.</P>
<P>That wild Vines runne naturally over <HI>Virginia,</HI> ocular experi|ence declares who delighting in the Neighbourhood of their belo|loved Mulberry-trees inseparable associates over all that Countrey, and of which in this their wildnesse Wines have beene made, of these Wines if transplanted and cultivated, there can be made no doubt but a Rich and Generous Wine would be produced: But
<PB N="7" REF="12">
if wee set the Greeke Cyprian Candian or Calabrian Grape, those Countries lying parallell with this, there neede not be made the smallest question<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but it would be a Staple which would enrich this Countrey to the envy of France and Spaine, and furnish the Nor|therne parts of Europe, and China it selfe where they plant it not, (of which more heereafter) with the Noblest Wine in the World, and at no excessive prices.</P>
<P>And from this Staple 'tis not unworthy of our most serious con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ideration, what an occasion of wealth would flow upon this Nati|on: Virginia when well peopled being able to match Spaine in that his Soveraigne Revenue, and the State by addition to their Customes for exportation thereof according to the mode of France and Spaine, would in no short time be sensible of this most inesti|mable benefit: To which if wee joyne the Profits of our Olives<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wee may (Gods favourable hand blessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g our industry) be the hap|piest Nation in Europe.</P>
<P>Nor need wee be at that charge for Caske under which Spain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> labours, where ever wee cast our eyes upon this Fortunate Countrey wee may finde Timber proper for it.</P>
<P>For the advance of which noble Staple, I should propose that the Greeke, and other Rich Vines, being procured from the Countries to which they are geniall, every Planter in that Coun|trey might be enjoyned to keepe a constant Nursery, to the end when the ground is cleared, that they may be fit for removal, and the Vineyard speedily planted.</P>
<P>Further that some Greeke, and other Vignerous might be hired out of those Countries to instruct us in the labour, and lest their en|vy, pride, or jealousie of being layd aside when their mysterie is discovered, may make them too reserved in communicating their knowledge, they may be assured, besides the continuance of their Pension of a share in the profits of every mans Vintage, which will the more easily perswade them to be liberall and faithfull in their instructions, since the publick advance of this designe cannot mis|carry without a sensible losse to their particular interest.</P>
<P>That before their going over a generall consultation may be had whith them what ground is proper, what season fit, what pre|vention of casualties by bleeding or splitting, what way to pre|serve or restore Wine when vesseld, which <HI>species</HI> of Wine is fittest
<PB N="8" REF="13">
for transportation over, or retention in the Countrey, which for duration, which for present spending: It being in experience mani|fest that some Wines refine themselves by purge upon the Sea, o|thers by the same meanes suffer an evaporation of their Spirits, joyne to this that some Wines collect strength and richnesse, others contract feeblenesse and sowernesse by seniority.</P>
<P>These consultations drawne to a head by some able person, and published to be sent over in severall Copies to Virginia, by the in|spection of which people might arrive at such competent know|ledge in the Mystery, that the reservation or jealousies of those Vig|nerons, could not but be presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> perceived and prevented.</P>
<P>But from hence no occasion should bee derived to breake or fall short of any contract made with those Vignerons, who are to be e|xactly dealt with in performance of Articles, every way made good unto them, with all just respects to win upon them, and the non|performance of this hath beene the originall cause why Virginia at this day doeth not abound with that excellent commodity. Those contracted with as hired servants for that imployment, by what miscariage I know not, having promise broken with them, and com|pelled to labour in the quality of Slaves, could not but expresse their resentment of it, and had a good colour of justice to conceale their knowledge, in recompence of the hard measure offered them, which occasioned the laying aside of that noble Staple, the diligent prose|cution whereof, had by this time brought Virginia to an absolute perfection in it, and to a great degree of happinesse and wealth which would attend it.</P>
<P>And had this beene as happily followed as it was prudently in|tended<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that excellent Country had not hung downe its desolate head in so languishing a condition as the disr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spect cast upon her, till of late yeares had reduced her to.

<P>And from hence might Barbadoes, St. Christophers, and all our Islands in the Indies, have richer, better, and by much cheaper, wines transported to them from a place much neerer in distance then Spain

or the Canaries) and which doubles the benefit such intercourse to|gether, would draw them to an association in power as well as com|munication of Staples.</P>
<P>Were this brought to a just perfection no other Nation could u|pon a quarrell betwixt Us, and Spaine, and France, reape a benefit by selling us their Wine at a third Market. And what wee vend now for it (that being made Native to us) might be returned in Bul|lion, to the apparent enriching of the Common-wealth, and the impoverishing of our Enemies, or at the least Friends deservedly suspected.</P>
<P>All Authours of Agriculture unanimously consent that neither Arable Pasture, Meadow, or any other Grounds are so benigne ge|nuine, or proper for planting Vines in, as those cleared Lands are, wherein not Shrubs, but Tall Trees were standing.

What Fleets come yeerely upon the coasts of New found Land, and New England for Fish, with an incredible returne? Yet tis a most assu|red truth, that if they would make experiment upon the South of Cape Cod, and from thence to the coast of this happy Countrey, they would find Fish of a greater delicacy, and as full handed plen|ty, which though Foraigners know not, yet if our owne Planters would make use of it, would yield them a Revenue which cannot admit of any diminution, whilest there are Ebbes and Flouds, Ri|vers feed and receive the Ocean, or Nature fayles in (the Elementall Originall of all things) Waters.</P>
<P>There wants nothing but industrious spirits and incouragement, to make a rich Staple of this commodity; and would the Virgini|ans but make Salt pits, in which they have a greater convenience of Tides (that part of the Universe by reason of a full influence of the Moone upon the almost limitlesse Atlantick causing the most sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cious Fluxes and Refluxes, that any shore of the other divisions in the World is sensible of) to leave their pits full of Salt|water, and more friendly and warme Sunbeames to concoct it into Salt, then Rochel, or any parts of Europe. Yet notwithstanding these advantages which prefer Virginia before Rochel, the French King rayses a large proportion of his Revenues out of that St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple yearly, with which he supplyes a great part of Christendome.</P>
<P>And if from this Staple the miserable French can procure a sub|sistence, some of them a comfortable livelyhood, notwithstanding all the private oppressions of their grinding Landlords, the Publick Tallies, Subsidies, Aides, Imposts, and other hard Titles of authori|zed Rapine. What shall wee imagine the freeborne English in a Countrey where he owes no Rent to any but to God and Nature, where he has Land to satisfie his desires in its extent, his wishes in its fertility, where free-quarter is a word onely understood by Re|port, may expect of profit and content both in this Staple of Salt, in that of Wines made in those Countries, where either the Spa|nish insolence and exactions, the French extortions, or the Turkish Imperiall Robberies, though in the highest degrees of exorbitance,

<P>Nor would it be such a long intervall (Salt being first made) be|twixt the undertaking of this Fishing, and the bringing it to per|fection; for if every servant were enjoyned to practise Rowing, to be taught to handle Sailes, and trimme a Vessell, a worke easily pra|ctised, and suddainely learned, the pleasantnesse of Weather in fish|ing season, the delicacy of the Fish, of which they usually feede themselves with the best, the encouragement of some share in the profit, and their understanding what their owne benefit may bee when their freedome gives them an equallity, will make them wil|ling and able Fisher-men and Seamen.</P>
<P>To adde further to this, if wee consider the abundance, largenesse, and peculiar excellency of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urgeon in that Countrey, it will not fall into the least of scruples, but that one <HI>species</HI> will bee of an invaluable profit to the buyer, or if wee repeate to our thoughts the singular plenty of Herrings and Mackarell, in goodnesse and great|nesse much exceeding what ever of that kinde these our Seas pro|duce, a very ordinary understanding may at the first inspection per|ceive that it will be no great difficulty to out-labour and out-vye the Hollander in that his almost onely Staple: Which wee may also sell at a cheaper Market then in common estimation; if wee revolve the Salt to be our owne, which they buy from France, or fetch from the Isle of May, and that the very fraight of Passengers (of which allured by this improvement, and the publick approbation, there will be constant multitudes) in our owne Shippes will at the least defray 3 fourths of the charges.</P>
<P>I should not unwillingly heare (though I dispaire ever to know it for a certainety) that <HI>China</HI> did exceede us in fishing; for were it granted, wee should not imagine those wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry Inhabitants so cir|cumscribed and limited to one part of the Ocean especially the same Climate and Latitude, inviting them as not to visit our opposite shore of Southwest <HI>Virginia</HI> in as great variety and plenty.</P>

Of this Mr. <HI>Porey</HI> in his discovery of the great River Chamonoak, to the South of <HI>Iames</HI> River delivers a Relation of infinite Quan|tity, covering the Surface of a Vast Forest of Pine-trees, being 60. miles in length.</P>
<P>It had beene wished that the injun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion given to every Plan|ter to set so many thousand Plants of this kinde had been effectu|ally prosecuted: The intermission whereof hath beene a prejudice not easily imaginable: Nor is it yet too late to effect it, and in all probability by transplantation it may thrive beyond comparison larger, and the skinne of it growne more tender and delicate, may arrive to some equality with the labour of the Silke-worme, if it be managed by such Rules of Nature best sute with its production.</P>
<P>For Hempe there is a naturall kinde of Hempe, a <HI>species</HI> of Flagg in that Countrey, from which being boyled you may strippe a long and fine skinne, not onely proper for Cordage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iner sort singularly usefull for Linnen; of this two hundred weight hath

<P>To the Brasse of <HI>China,</HI> wee shall oppose the <HI>Virginian</HI> Copper (or Gold, for yet it is doubtfull) for by a concurrent Relation of all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndians, justified to severall English of Quality, particular|ly to the Earle of <HI>Southampton</HI> in Mr. <HI>Poryes</HI> Narrative, to Sir <HI>Wil|liam Berkely,</HI> all seconding Mr. <HI>Heriots</HI> Report, that within ten dayes West toward the setting of the Sunne, the Natives of that Countrey gathered a kinde of a Red Sand falling with a streame is|suing from a Mountaine, which being washed in a sive, and set up|on the fire speedily, melts and becomes some Copper, which they shew us, but as they say much softer.

<P>Nor shall wee plead inferiority in Pearles with China or Persia, since Mr. <HI>Heriot</HI> assures us of a large quantity of Pearles found a|mongst the Natives, spoyled by their ignorance in boring of them, and defacing their orientall lustre, by exposing them to the fire. These were found amongst the Indians at Roanoak, and the Relati|ons of the Natives on all hands unanimously concur that the South and West of this opulent Countrey was stored with such abundance and variety, that the Indians used to make and adorne Babies with them: And one of the English had collected a Bracelet of very o|rientall Pearle, to the number of five thousand, which were all lost in the Returne to England.</P>
<P>If China suppose a merit of precedency in Muske, Virginia may justly oppose them with her Musk Rat, or Muscassus, which in all probability cannot but be the same; for it is a tradition recei|ved into the Number of truths, that the Confection of their Muske in that Countrey is bruizing and burying a certaine Creature to pu|trefaction, of which this Odour is effected, and it is very open to conjecture that this Musk-Rat or Muscassus, whose flesh and skinne are extraordinary redolent and durant, and of which there is an in|finite plenty, by such order may be brought to the same perfection. Neither is it so improbable that this Odour should proceed from putrefaction, which is naturally an abhorrence to the Nosthrill: for if you apply too neare to the substance of the Muske, there is an oc|cult subolency of such a putrefactive originall. Neither are all ex|cretions of Nature in themselves offensive to the sense of smelling, for the Fluxe of the Civet-Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is accounted amongst our most sove|raigne Perfumes: And this experimented will be a Staple of noble use, and no lesse benefit.</P>
<P>Nor shall wee yeeld the Laurell of preeminence in Richnesse of Furres to China, if the Furres of Beavers, Otters, Martines, and a|bove all Black Foxes (which are upon some part of this Continent) may pretend any title to Richnesse: And yet have wee beene hi|therto so supinely negligent to permit the Dutch and the French to carry away most of this pretious Commodity, to trade in our Ri|vers,

<P>To conclude, what ever else China may presume to boast of: Whether Nitre, Allum, Quicksilver, Rhubarb, and China Root, of which some wee have already discovered: If wee consider the pa|rallell in Latitude, the equality of temperate Climate, the parity in soile, and its fertility, the similitude in brave Navigable Rivers, the unanimous congruity and consent in divers knowne Commodities, wee shall have an ample basis to ground conjectures upon, that what ever singularity of Nature that Nation may imagine her selfe Victorious over others, will be found equall in this Garden of the World, this aemulous Rivall of China, Virginia: And the Chine|ses may with as great justice deny the Europeans the benefit of both eyes, as boast that they precede in any thing except Antiquity of habitation and a long experienced industry, this great Luminary of the new World Virginia.</P>
<P>What ever other commodities, the Novelty of inhabiting this a|morous Virgin hath made it appeare defective in, as Sugar, Indigo, Cotton, Ginger, and other advantageous Staples, wee shall appeale to all who have seene this unexampled Countrey; (we meane Roa|noak, and the more Southerne parts, and those Countries towards the fertile Mangoack) whether it be guilty of any contrariety, di|stemper, or extremity, which might hinder their production. The Sunne, which in other Countreys makes his visit in Flames and Droughts, heere casts his auspicious Beames, and by an innocent and complementall warmth, courts the bosome of this his particu|lar favourite, hastening and disposing its wombe for ripe producti|ons, which salute him in an absolute perfection.

<P>But if we may beleeve Printed Relations (and the person delive|ring it so cleerely, is, in my opinion, worthy of all credit) Tobacco from Surat to Moco yeeld ten for one profit, returned in Eastridge feathers to England you have six to one profit; but this is for those Planters who are so infected with that disease of the Countrey, that they cannot admit of any other Staple, though more gainefull and lesse laborious.

<P>And the same <HI>Tellier</HI> is bold to affirme, that <HI>non obstante</HI> the disa|greeablenesse of the Country to that worme, in the Kingdome of France from the sole revenue now of Silke, arises a greater intrade then from their Corne, Oyle and Woad put together, which grow in that Kingdome in vast proportions.

<P>If France (an almost improper Countrey for this improvement) can rayse within the verge of fifty yeeres, so large and numerous a revenue, what shall we imagine Italy (a warmer Region, and by much more convenient, although not altogether Native for this in|riching creature) may meerely upon this Staple returne in their Treasury, having besides the advantage of Climate, a hundred and fifty yeeres precedency in the mystery, and their seed more s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rong, better fed, and lesse subject to diseases and casualties?</P>
<P>But Virginia a Countrey which Nature hath no lesse particul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly assigned for the production, food, and perfection of this Creature then Persia or China stored naturally with infinites of Mul|berry-trees, some so large that the leaves thereof have by French|men beene esteemed worth 5l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in which the indigenall and naturall Worme hath beene found as bigge as Wallnuts, and thriving, in the South thereof in admirable plenty and excellence; if this mystery were but duly followed, and industriously promoved, might be a Magazine for all the Westerne World, and singly in her selfe out|vy France, Spaine, and Italy, in all their advantages collected.</P>
<P>Heere the Leaves are onely sold by nature, who requires no other satisfaction then industry to make use of her bounty.

<P>To further this happy designe, let us d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">scend into an unequall comparison: Let us compare our most incomparable Virginia, where the Mulberry and the Worme are aboriginall to Italy, where they are onely adventitious: Let us imagine our owne Worme of that strength and greatnesse onely equall to those of Brescia and I|taly, where the usuall of come from sixe ounces of seede is 72, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at least 60 pound weight of Silke, and adhearing to this Parallell; let us see the apparency in the profit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>A man and a boy, if their hands be not sleeping in their pockets, will feede as many Wormes as come of sixe or eight ounces of seed till they be past their foure first sicknesses, and within some 14 dayes of spinning: Indeed the last 14 dayes require a more extraordinary diligence and attendance, a more frequent and carefull feeding, be|cause in that time they conceive, gather, and store up the disposing matter from whence the Silke comes, which by an incomprehensi|ble mystery of Nature, they after as it were vomit out of their mouthes, and spinne out of their bowells. At this more particu|lar season, there is a necessity of adding the labour of three or foure helpes more (to which Women or Children are as proper as Men) which is an inconsiderable accession considering the gaine arising from it.</P>
<P>That you may know the reason why Women, Children, lame and impotent persons are as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itting to attend the last fourteene dayes, as Men, will appeare by their labour, which is nothing but to feede them within doores, cleanse, dry and perfume their lodgings, with some strengthning<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but not overstrong odour.</P>
<P>And as one skilfull in this noble mystery is sufficient for the em|ploying, overseeing, and directing hundreds under him, so (the skill being rather experimentally to be taught, then built upon long and ambiguous precepts) he may bee able to perfect all those under him, within the five or six weeekes time of their imployment in the full understanding the mystery.

the teacher and learner of the mystery, the master should be invited by reward to be liberall in communicating his knowledge, and those under his instruction encouraged by arguments of honour and profit proposed to the best proficient, would disperse seeds of emulation and diligence, since every one would imploy himselfe seriously to engrosse and appropriate to himselfe the reputation and advantage in the victory.</P>
<P>And in boyes and children, disputations frequently set on foot, with some slight distinction of merit, would make all that are inge|niously disposed, quicken their observation and diligence, to gaine the credit of prelation. Though to take off all disincouragement or despayre, from those lesse apprehensive and docible, in this noble and gainefull Trade of Silke, there is no such absolute necessity layd upon them to be supersticiously and precisely curious in observing the Booke Rules, and written Precepts, that upon the omission or unpunctuall observation of any of those Precepts in hatching, lod|ging, feeding, and tending of the Silke-wormes, wee should ima|gine such minute deviations might occasion an improsperity or gene|rall failing: for wee will admit something may be wanting either in materialls, accommodation, or precisenesse of knowledge; yet may the worke (a higher and irresistible cause not interrupting it) prosper and succeede, notwithstanding such defect, to the great con|tentment and gaine of them which keepe them.</P>
<P>Let us imagine it to be granted that the indigency of the person improving the incommodiousnesse of the place, or want of House-roome, which the Bookes exactly tye us to, be in many things pre|terr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gular (though such a supposition may fall upon any other part of the World more justly then Virginia, where all materialls and conveniency answer our exactest wishes) yet will dayly examples confirme us, that in Languedoc, Provence, and other parts of France, and as many in Spaine and Italy, amongst the common sort of that exaction tyred people, that one poore low-rooft Cottage, and one Roome in it is all the house extent they have to take their sleepe in, dresse their miserable dyet, and serve themselves of for use and re|tirement; yet does this industrious Creature (such are the blessings with which God rewards the sweat of Industry) thrive as happily (and sometimes answer labour with a greater fellcity) as tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e which the curiosity of Richer persons fit with all commodiousnesse

Wee must therefore lift up our hearts and eyes with thankefullnesse unto the Hills, unto the Mountaine of Israel, and Rock of <HI>David,</HI> from whence those streames of blessings must acknowledge their sole, their originall Fountaine, which may serve as an admonition, that neither the whole, nor any part of the worke should be begunne without applying our devotions to him: Let it therefore be the Morning Omen to the worke, and the Eve|ning auspice, Lord prosper the worke of our hands, prosper good Lord our handy workes. After the Reposall of this confidence in God; let him apply himselfe with his greatest industry and ability, with this comfort and assurance, that he cannot but make a conside|rable returne: Though wee should be much injurious to Art (the noble right hand and Midwife to Nature) if wee should deny a more promising probability of a riper and fuller gaine the more cu|rious and observant he is in following all the approved experiments, Rules, directions, and precepts thereunto belonging.</P>
<P>But the chiefest aime and intention of those Rules are to illustrate the perfection of this Art, and to informe your knowledge, and bet|ter your future experience and preventionall care, if any misadven|ture arrive, or miscarriage in the Silke-wormes, or if they prosper not equally this yeare with the last; for by inspection upon them you may understand the cause and reason of such misadventure, and with it the remedy; and this also takes away all dispaire or disin|couragement for men, commonly men till they are convinced in the naturall cause of a disaster or failing attribute, all such mischances to Nature, or else impute the non-thriving to their owne misfortune by a ridiculous opinion that they are not ordained to be fortunate in this or that Mystery, so freequently does Fortune incurre the blame
<PB N="35" REF="22">
of humane neglect or ignorance.</P>
<P>Besides wee are to imprint in our knowledge, that no Rules c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n have so much of generality and exactnesse, which will not admit of deviations arising from some particular and variable circumstances. Wee must not therefore conforme the nature of the Climate to our Rules, but our Rules to it, in which wee must resume to your deli|beration how, and in what one Climate differs from another, how the constitution of this yeare varies from the next, or the precedent, the immediocrities of heate, cold, drought, and moisture, serenity, or mists, &amp;c. The manner of their lodgings, the quality of the winde to be admitted or excluded: To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emper a season inclining to a preternaturall coolenesse with an artificiall heate, to refresh and infrigidate the Aire in times of immoderate heate, by admitting the cooling Aire and Windes proceeding from a cooler Quarter, and this to be observed with a more particular care; when they spinne their Silke, that Creature then being very obnoxious to be stifled with too much heat.</P>
<P>There must be likewise a providentiall regard in a moist season, that the Mulberry leaves be carefully dryed after their gathering, before they be administred for food to the Silke-worme: But if the season pertake more of drought it will be wisedome to let the leaves lye and shade a little after their gathering, that they may have them coole and refreshing, and in seasons of temperature and con|tinued droughts, it may be very requisite to water the Roots of the Mulberry-tree, which will be a refreshing to the leaves, and this is usually practised in Spaine; especially if the Mulberry-tree be sea|ted in a hot or dry ground, which otherwise must not be so prescri|bed without particular caution.</P>
<P>Nor is it below our consideration to weigh the condition of the place in which the Mulberry is planted, if in a sower foule or wet soile to collect what inconvenience that food may bring unto your worme, and therefore if your necessity will admit it to avoyd such wholly, if not to use them with such qualifications as may make them l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ast offensive.</P>
<P>After having regard to the nature of the ground your Tree re|ceives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts juce from, the quality of the season, in which you gather them; it falls next to your consideration to compare the kinde and nature of the Tree, together with the kinde and nature of their

<P>But time and observations will affoord you many experiments, out of which perhaps some more rules of Art may be framed, in di|vers particulars, more consenting to the Country and Climate of Virginia. Which finding, after good triall thereupon made, it will become the reputation of a good Patriot in generall, and a good Ma|ster of a family in particular, to digest them into such a regular or|der and method, that the publication thereof may be a common be|nefit to all, and a private memoriall to particulars.</P>
<P>For since in Persia and China it does not fall under likelihood, that they can oblige themselves to observe all particulars in its stri|ctest limitation, where such an infinite quantity of silke passeth through the hands of the people, it is very agreeable to reason that in a Climate of the same nature and parallell, namely Virginia, there may be rules found out of far l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse brevity<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and more pertinency, then have yet been considered or published.</P>
<P>And yet where all these Rules are curiously observed, they make not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in Spaine and Italy, but in the colder parts of France a far greater gaine (the quantity of adventure and time considered) by thus chargeably fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding of Silk-wormes, then by any other com|modity whatsoever.</P>
<P>But to avoid that inconvenience of fetching leaves a far off, or attending the growth of your owne Mulberries, or that necessity which makes the poorer sort of our owne miserable people to lodge them in that Roome which is their Kitchin, their Chamber, their all. With what ease and conveniency may there be a house set up in the middle of a Grove of Mulberries, naturally growing, where the Silkewormes, in a dry Cabinet of Boords, after the maner of Sicily, may be kept (described more largely in the Bookes which treat of this Silkeworme, then can bee expected in this paper) set up with stones in it, in case the Countrey and season require it, eyther to cor|rect the ill sents, or (if so be they are seated in cold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moyst, or shady places, of which your owne sense and experience will quickly ac|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">int you) to give the ayre a temper and qualification, which if not

<P>And this Lodge built for them, the season of the yeere will in|vite your selfe and family (I meane such part of your family as you assigne to this worke) to lodge there also, the time being at the most but six weekes, and for the first moneth, one third of your fa|mily will be sufficient to feed them, but the last 14. dayes; the o|ther 2. thirds will be requisit that the wormes may bee more often and plentifully fed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the well feeding at that time contributing much to their strength and perfection, and consequently to the improving your expected silke, both in quantity and quality.</P>
<P>That all may be invited and courted to this undertaking, in this glorious Countrey, Nature hath left us destitute of no materialls. To erect these slight silken lodgings, will be no more expences, then your labour; nor is that any greater, then to cut out some posts and studdes, fit them, and set them up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then to cleave and saw out small quarters, rafters, plankes, pales, and boards, to make and set up the sides of the house, in stead of more substantiall walls, and to cover the roofe in stead of Tile. For the effecting of all which with the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ser trouble, that Countrey affords abundance of Woods, which will runne out, slit, and cleave into long lengths and br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adths, which by the directnesse of the Ground will rive in a manner, as if they had beene sawen for the worke. All which must be so close layd, joyned, and nayled together, the one still lapt over the other, that no Winde or Raine may penetrate therein to offend that labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rious Creature, and this may easily be prevented, if such chinkes and open places as you shall discover bee stopped up with Lome, Clay, and Lime, of which materialls in those Countreyes you will finde no want. And to this purpose the Indian Mats, and the like things may be made good use of in this way, which will be sure to keepe out Winde and perhaps Raine: But to these things your owne inventions, <HI>pro re nata,</HI> will abundantly furnish you with matter of preventing casualties: Nor will it bee unseasonable to repeat the extraordinary convenience of Saw-mills, which in this case will be in a high degree serviceable to you, and of this the whole Colony will be beneficially sensible in boards, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lankes, hou|sing, Silk-worm-lodgings, Timber, shipping, and all particular kinde of uses.</P>

<P>Or being in doubt of surprisall, some Families going into the Woods together may equally joyne together, and those woodden houses (still observing that the Roomes where the wormes are may be set end and end together, that so the Kitchins and their lodgings may be still the two extreames) may be cast into the forme of a Fort which pall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sadoed, and your house sentinelled by halfe a dozen of good Dogges, wilbe a sufficient defence against all the Natives of the Countrey.</P>
<P>And this may be in case they worke not in common, which if by compact they agree upon, the Lodging for the wormes may be cast in the middle of such a circle, the Timber houses round about sha|ding them from over much heat, wind or moisture, and the necessary fires there made, will throughly cleere the ayre of all vapours and mists which may disorder this innocent Spinner.

<ITEM>2. But to feed his curiosity, there is nothing in the world more proper then this curious atome of Nature the Silkeworme: to see this untaught Artist spin out his transparent bowels, labour such a monument out of his owne intralls, as may be the shame, the blush of Artists, such a Robe that Solomon in all his glory might con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esse the meannesse of his apparell, in relation to the workemen, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnot but bring them to admiration; and that those spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s whose t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oughts are of a higher wing then ordinary, may bee convinced of a divine power of the hand of God in the Creation: which gaynd upon him, it will not be impossible to drive him to an acknowledgement of Redemption, if private ends or any other respect then that to Gods glory, possesse not those who should cover a multitude of sinnes, by winning a soule to his Creator, and forcing him from the jawes of his Destroyer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In this curiosity there is little or no labour (a thing which they abhorre) their women and children will bee sufficient to goe through with it: and if they could but be brought to it, our T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade with them for silke would be of greater consequence, then all their Furs or other commodities put together.</ITEM>

<P>Neither doe I comprehend a sufficient Reason why in so happy a Climate as that of Virginia; there may not be a double Silke Har|vest: This I am sure of, that there are secrets in Nature of retarda|tion as well as acceleration of Springs, and both being industriously brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the experiment, the acceleration ante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeding the first Spring, and the retardation postvening the latter by three weekes, (which may easily be effected by election and distinction of ground to plant in) and at the latter end of the Harvest the seeds being dis|posed and ripened for production, will without doubt produce an effect answerable to the most inestimable profit intended by it.</P>
<P>That the election of Ground may doe this, wee may see by free|quent examples betwixt things well cultivated, and that which is never transplanted from its first wildnesse, and there are many pre|sidents round about us, where in one and the same Towne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one and the same fruit have oftentimes three Weekes distance of time be|twixt their unequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll maturity; the naturall warmenesse or coldnes of the Ground occasioning the advance or procrastination of fruits according to its severall disposition.</P>
<P>Nor can such a course be any interruption to Harvest or Vintage, both comming much after the season of the Silke-worme, though
<PB N="33" REF="25">
I should (in submission to better judgement) conceive that with transplantation of trees (such as they would have come later then ordinary, for that purpose being loosed from the Ground neare upon the as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt of their sap would spring for that season ac|cording to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir expectation later then is usuall, and the next yeare its novelty of ground having made it wanton will come much ear|lier, and more improved then those whose fixure to the place of its first pullulation keepes it selfe to its former constancy, and by this meanes the later Harvest would not be at the most three Weekes time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter the (usuall) income of the first.</P>
<P>And without doubt the Chineses and Persian could not vend such vast quantities of Silke, with which they fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shion so huge a part of the World with one single Harvest, which though wee are at present ignorant of, yet what should discourage us from delive|ring such conjectures to a tryall, since the examen of it is not with|out probability, nor the discovery without an extraordinary cer|tainety of profit?</P>
<P>Those who will object that notwithstanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00 years practice Italy hath not discovered this mystery, or if discovered, found it destitute of successe, may be pleased to receive this Answer: That there is an immense disproportion betwixt the happyest Region of Italy, and the South of the excellent Virginia. Italy (and that an|nually) is subject much to inclemency of Winters, in respect of our more temperate Maiden, where Snows and black Swans are alike Prodigies; the cold there is rather like a Phletomy to tame the Ple|thorick abundance of Springs, then dead it: Nor are the Springs of Italy so early as ours in that Climate, and the Mulberry shooting forth later then all other T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ees by much, may by this meanes of transplantation and heat of soile, be equall with the first, and by that early apparence give day-light to this and other more abstruse Magnalia.</P>
<P>I have ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sted so much the longer upon this Mystery of the Silk-worme, because (if it were handled by a better pen, judgement, and ability) it is every way noble and sublime, so much worthy the knowledge, not onely for the benefit (which is extraordinary rich how ever) but for the admiration of Nature, who hath ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evi|ated all the Volum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her other Miracl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s into this her little, but exact Epitome, like that Artist who contracted the whole body

<P>Besides what wee have sayd of Silke wee shall find the Indian profitable to himselfe, and as in the Staple of Wines, of which when he has received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he whole knowledge, wee cannot make the least tittle of doubt, but he will with all eagernesse prosecute it: First, because it concernes his belly, to which no people unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hea|ven are more indulgent; and secondly, his Wife and Children who plant his Corne may take the charge of the Vineyard with not much more labour. But that which turnes to our advantage is, that the Indian communicating the knowledge of the Grape to his Neighbours, and they transmitting it all along as far as New Spain, will stir up the Spanish jealousie to interdict all Viti-culture a|mongst them, and as far as the extent of his power can fathome to prosecute severely all such Natives as shall make it a subject of their industry to the prejudice of Spaine. This must of necessity make strong combinations and leagues against the Spanish Tyranny, which though they are not of themselves able to shake off, yet will the Spanyard feare to extend himselfe further (except in such strength as at present his condition denies him) knowing the Indi|ans untinguishable thirst of Revenge, and his laying hold of all opportunities to put it in execution, with all the powers of his un|derstanding cruelty and malice.</P>
<P>And thus shall the Spanyard in case he attempts our supplantati|on be constantly discovered by the siding Indian, and if there be a necessity to prevent his malice, by turning his designe upon his owne head, infinite occasion of intelligence may wee have from the enraged Native, how to attaque him in his strongest security, where either the distance or impassability of the way will make him con|fident and carelesse.</P>
<P>Further use may be made of the Native in fishing after Pearle, to which if wee allure him by a constant Trade with him for them, his owne profit will quickly enlighten his desire of more, and that desire quicken his industry.</P>
<P>That Virginia affordes multitude of Pearles, Mr. <HI>Lane</HI> is suffici|ent to give publick information, where he tells us a Relation deli|vered to him of a Weroance, who had so great quantity of Pearle, and did so ordinarily take the same, as that not onely his owne skinnes that he weareth, and the better sort of his Gentlemen and
<PB N="35" REF="26">
Followers are set with the sayd Pearle; but also his beds and hou|ses are garnished with them, and that he hath such quantity of them that it is wonder to see: These are Mr. <HI>Lanes</HI> words exactly.</P>
<P>Nor is there any difficulty in the discovery of this, or ingrossing the Trade; especially since wee are the Masters of the Countrey, and if any other Nation should attempt to partake in the benefit of our Trade, the strength of Virginia is at present such as may repell by violence, all Forraigne incroachments upon their trade and livelyhood.</P>
<P>The Indians unanimously consent that twenty two mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s beyond the Falls, is a Rocke of Chrystall, and this they evidence by their a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rowes very many whereof are headed with it. And that 3 dayes journey from thence, is a Rocke or Hill of Silver Oare. Beyond which, over a ledge of Hills, by a concurrent Relation of all the In|dians, is the Sea, which can be no other but that Sea which washes the shore of China, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That this report of a great Sea Southwest beyond the Mountains, cannot have the least of fiction or confederacy, since all the Indians from Canada to Florida, doe unjarringly agree in the Relation, is obvious to the meanest apprehension.</P>
<P>The discovery whereof, if we fall upon it by degrees, will bee a worke of no long time or difficulty, but the unexpressible profit and glory of the action, will rayse the noble head of this above example Countrey to such a high Zenith of wealth, power, and lustre, that it will be reputed a very remarkable degree of felicity to any Nation which shall reach to such a Verticall point of glory, as to bee repu|ted but our second in these most noble considerations.</P>
<P>By this meanes what wealth can there be in those richest provin|ces of the World, in those Countries which Nature created for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Cabinets of excellency, which we shall not discover?

<P>That it must not bee attempted at the first heat, but must have more recourses then one to the fire of a Triall, will bee made appa|rent by these reasons.</P>
<P>First, the inconveniency or non feysibility of carrying so much provision as will serve the Discoverers, whose number, in my opi|nion, cannot bee lower then two hundred, if wee let slide into our deliberation the many unknowne Nations, through whose territo|ries we are to make our passage, and which by common esti|mation, are much more numerous in the Inland, then Marine Countreyes.</P>

<P>The safest way therefore is, by degrees to steale upon the design, and take our way thither, by ceasing of places of advantage, very frequently found in that Contry, which we may progressionaly for|tifie at every twenty or five and twenty miles distance, and to these places we may constantly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end supplies of victu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls and ammuniti|on, not only for the men there Garrisond, but for our owne recep|tion and maint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nance in the Discovery: and these men standing continu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly upon their guard, may (I meane those most rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te) by conference with the Indians, discover with much ease, of what di|stance, what accesse, what harbours, what frequentation, and by what people the neighbour Sea consists of; to take with them ex|emplars of all Mineralls, Drugges, Dies, Colours, Birds and Beasts, drawne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the life in colours, which (by an invitation of reward) will be a surer meanes of discovery, (if any such be) then by multi|tudes of people, whose number commonly (as in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mple of <HI>Fernando Soto</HI> in Florida) hastens no other discovery, but that of unavoydable famine, and being usually, either through nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssity, or a disordred maner of living irregular and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngoverned, fright the in|habitants from all commerce and conference or else make th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m join in a confederacy to abuse and remove them by telling their unwel|come Company, golden lies, and miracles of Countreys farther di|stant, where they are likely to find small satisfaction for their co|vetousnes or hunger.</P>

<P>Though wee may entertaine grounds of hope and confidence, that this discovery of the South Sea may be made without any tedi|ous Land-journey, since it is certaine that from the great confluence of Waters in the Gulfe of St. Laurence, foure mighty Rivers receive their sourse, the first whereof pouring it selfe North into Canada, another running Eastward into the Sea called Hunsons River, the third running Westward into the Maine are already discovered, but the fourth upon which wee have reason to fixe high expectation be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding Southward to Florida, washes all the backside of Virginia, and may in all probability discharge it selfe into the South Ocean, which if it suit with our conjectures, Virginia will have by that meanes a double accession of security and convenience.</P>
<P>For our security it will be a naturall bar betwixt us and the jea|lous Spanyard, who if he shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d injustly continue the possession of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Florida, which is indisputably English; yet thus dividided from us by a vast River full of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">slands, and places convenient to command the Channell fortified and maintained by our Nation, he is too full of providence and caution to attaque us, if once in so good a posture.</P>
<P>For the conveniency which sufficiently speakes it selfe the ease of transportation by water, and all in our owne Chanell, the saving of Land charges, and probability of a more speedy passage, are prespi|cuous arguments to commend it.</P>
<P>And to confirme the probabilities of this passage by the Lake the more strongly, the Indians of Canada confessed to <HI>Iames Cartier</HI> that it is but a Moneths sayling, from thence to go to a Land where Cynanon and Cloves are gathered. Others told the same person, that from the place where they left their Pinnace, there is a River which goeth South-West, from whence there is a whole Moneths

<P>But it is time to remit these high and noble atchievements to the prosecution of those who have more power and ability, who may give such a discovery the honour of their names, and transfer a per|petuall illustrious memory to posterity, we shall onely suppose it faisible and hope the effects will answer such supposition.</P>
<P>Which if it should faile, why may not Virginia in her future fe|licity of silke be a new China and Persia to Europe? why may not all the spicery of the East flourish with an equall successe in this our most justly tempered Climate? already can Virginia boast of Cina|mon, which if transplanted might not be inferiour unto any? why may not the Cloves perfume Virginia with as aromatick redolency as the Philipine Gardens.</P>
