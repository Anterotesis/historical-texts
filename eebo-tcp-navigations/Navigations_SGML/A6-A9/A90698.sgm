<P>HAving been &s;ome years Secretary to the King's Mini&s;ter at the Court of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and brought &s;ome Memoirs from thence relating both to the Ancient and Mo|dern
<PB REF="3">State of that King|dom, I was prevailed with, through the Importunities of &s;ome Friends, to com|mit them to the Pre&s;s. For the <HI>Northern</HI> Regions not lying in the u&s;ual Road of our Travellers, and not being thought to have any thing &s;ufficiently inviting as to engage them to undergo the inconvenien|cies and hard&s;hips that at|tend all Voyages into tho&s;e Parts, nor to make &s;uch a &s;tay as is requi&s;ite for the
<PB REF="3">rendring their Ob&s;ervations worthy of the Curio&s;ity of the Age. We are gene|rally very much in the Dark as to the Government and Manners of tho&s;e People.

<HEAD>THE <HI>Pre&s;ent State</HI> OF <HI>DENMARK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> con|taining that part of the <HI>Cimbrick, Cher&s;one&s;e,</HI> called <HI>Juitland, Hol|&s;tein,</HI> a great Shoal of I&s;lands, the Prin|cipal whereof are <HI>Zealand, Funen,</HI> and many more, but of le&s;s Note, with the great continent of <HI>Norway,</HI> and the I&s;les thereof, is Bounded on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> with the Main <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Ocean, on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> with the <HI>Bal|tick</HI> Sea, on the <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> with part of <HI>Sweedland, Full-North</HI> with the Main Frozen Ocean, and on the <HI>South</HI> with <HI>Germany,</HI> from which it is &s;eperated on the <HI>South-we&s;t</HI> by the River <HI>Albis,</HI> and on the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> by the <HI>Trave,</HI> a &s;mall <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> or Neck of Land Uniting it to that Con|tinent.</P>
<P>It had its Name from the People of tho&s;e many I&s;lands which lie together in the <HI>Bay</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="6">or <HI>Gulph,</HI> called <HI>Sinus Codanus,</HI> (Now the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea,) who took upon them the Name of <HI>Danes,</HI> Extending their Name afterwards as they did their Conque&s;t, and not from <HI>Dan</HI> a Fabulous King thereof, above a Thou&s;and years before the Birth of our Saviour.</P>
<P>As for its Po&s;ition in regard of the Hea|vens, part of it lieth within the <HI>Northern</HI> temperate <HI>Zone,</HI> and part within the <HI>Artict</HI> Circle; reaching from the middle Parallel of the 10th Clime, or 55 Degree of Latitude, where it Joyneth with <HI>Ger|many</HI> as far as the 71 Degree, where the Frozen Ocean is its only Boundary, thus the longe&s;t Day in the <HI>Southern</HI> parts hereof, is 17 hours and a quarter: But in the parts farthe&s;t <HI>North,</HI> they have no Night for two whole Months, three Weeks, one day, and &s;ome Seaven hours over; as on the Contrary, no Day for the like &s;pace of time, when the Sun is farthe&s;t di&s;tant in the other <HI>Tropick.</HI> Thus the Air would be very &s;harp and bitter, were it not Tem|perated by the warm Vapours of the Sun, by which means in <HI>Juitland, Zealand,</HI> and the Adjoyning I&s;lands, it is not &s;o Cold as in places which lie much more <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho the Land be Naturally Sterile, and affording little be&s;ides Woods and
<PB N="3" REF="6">Mountains, yet the Care and Indu&s;try of the Inhabitants have made it very Fruit|ful.</P>
<P><HI>Denmark</HI> abounds in Rich Pa&s;tures, which Feed &s;uch va&s;t Numbers of Cattle, that it has been &s;ome times known, that in one Year a Hundred-Thou&s;and Cows and Oxen, have been hence Exported in|to <HI>Germany</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> which brings a Va&s;t Income to the Kingdom, nor do they want excellent Breeds of Hor&s;es, that part of it called <HI>Oldenburg</HI> e&s;pecially, Furni&s;hing the be&s;t and fine&s;t Coach-Hor&s;es of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea Coa&s;ts of <HI>Juitland, Zealand,</HI> and other parts of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Territories, are plied with &s;uch Va&s;t Shoals of <HI>Herrings, Plai&s;e, Whitings, Cod,</HI> and other Fi&s;h, that they are almo&s;t capable of Hindring the Pa&s;&s;age of Boats and Ships.</P>
<P>Nor are their Forre&s;ts le&s;s &s;tocked with Veni&s;on, there being no le&s;s every Hun|ting Sea&s;on than Fifteen Hundred <HI>Bucks</HI> brought into the Kings Pallaces, be&s;ides Va&s;t numbers of Wilde <HI>Boars, Hares,</HI> and &s;uch like &s;ort of Gaim.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, the mean Opinion which the <HI>Romans</HI> had, and the Ill Charact|er they have given us of all the <HI>Northern</HI> Nations, yet they found them&s;elves con|&s;trained
<PB N="4" REF="7">to Buckle under their Vigourous Attacks, and abandon their City and Country as a Prey to the Pillage and Mercy of the Triumphing <HI>Cambrians,</HI> nor are the other <HI>Northern</HI> Nations, in&s;en&s;ible of the Mettle and keenne&s;s of the <HI>Dan|i&s;h</HI> Swords; the <HI>Danes</HI> having Conquered <HI>Ireland</HI> no le&s;s than Eight &s;everal times, Beaten, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ten times and who for a long while were Subject to the Kings of <HI>Den|mark; Scotland</HI> for &s;ome time Tributary to this Crown; <HI>Saxony</HI> has paid Homage to &s;everal of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Kings, and <HI>Sweeden</HI> frequently own'd e'm for their Soveraigns, nor is the Kingdom of <HI>Norway</HI> a &s;mall proof of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Courage, neither have their Women been Barren of Brave per|formances, their Exploits being equally Glorious with tho&s;e of the greate&s;t Heroes of other Nations. But Valour and War|like Conduct are not the only qualities prai&s;e worthy in the <HI>Danes,</HI> they are no le&s;s to be Commended for their. Ho&s;pita|lity and Extraordinary Complai&s;ance to all Strangers; and tho their Entertainments do &s;ometimes degenerate into Luxury and exce&s;s, yet without doubt the Crime is much more Pardonable in them than tho&s;e who live under a more happy Climate. The <HI>Danes</HI> indeed are Haughty and Super|&s;titiou&s;ly
<PB N="5" REF="7">Jealous of their Honor, revenging the lea&s;t outrage and contempt, and re&s;ent|ing to a High Degree all things which give the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of an Affront, and as they are Rigorous Pro&s;ecutors of In&s;ults done to them&s;elves, &s;o are they no le&s;s &s;evere Puni&s;hers of Criminals of State, e&s;pecially Thieves and Pirates. And as they are Peremptory in their Executing of Ju&s;tice upon Offenders, &s;o are they mo&s;t Religious in doing and Di&s;tributing it where due, and Inviolable ob&s;ervers of their Words and Contracts.</P>
<P>The Bulck and Stature of the Bodies of the <HI>Danes,</HI> does in &s;omewi&s;e &s;uit with the Grandure of their minds, and tho the Luxu|ry of the Age has &s;o far prevailed in <HI>Den|mark</HI> as to qua&s;h the growth of their Mo|dern <HI>Danes</HI> in re&s;pect of their Ance&s;tors, yet they be &s;till more Large, Strong, Vi|gorous, and long Liv'd than mo&s;t or any of their Neighbours. They are generally fair Complexion'd, their Hair &s;omething in|clined to Yellow.</P>
<P>Their common Food is on Corn, Fi&s;h, and all manner of Tame and Wild Bea&s;ts that are Mans Meat, which they have in great abundance. And among&s;t their many kind of Fowl, they have greater &s;tore of Wood-Cocks than any other Coun|trey
<PB N="6" REF="8">what&s;oever. The Old Liquor of <HI>Den|mark</HI> was <HI>Oel,</HI> (<HI>Ale,</HI> or <HI>Beer,</HI>) made of Malt and Water, and is &s;till their com|mon and mo&s;t general Drink. And tho Wine has now obtain'd much among them, yet perhaps their exce&s;s therein has Cur|tailed much of their pri&s;tine Vigour, and that had they kept con&s;tant and &s;olely to their <HI>Oel,</HI> it might have &s;pirited them to as great Actions as tho&s;e of their Pre|dece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Language, it is only a di&s;tinct Dialogue of the <HI>Teutonick,</HI> the <HI>High-Dutch, Sweedi&s;h, Norwegion, Flan|drian,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being no more, and all Derived from one Mother Tongue.</P>
<P>As for the Government of <HI>Denmark,</HI> without dwelling upon the Fabulous &s;tories of King <HI>Dan,</HI> it is Evidently to be made out, that it was a Monarchy in the Con&s;ult&s;hip of <HI>Catulus</HI> and <HI>Marius,</HI> near a hundred years before <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> after which we have an account of one <HI>Gothrick</HI> King of the <HI>Danes</HI> in the time of the Emperour <HI>Charles Magne,</HI> from whom the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Denmark</HI> is De&s;cended in a Lineal Succe&s;&s;ion, though &s;ome Authors do affirm that the Ancient Line failed in the Death of King <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> the 3d.</P>
<P>The Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> it &s;elf was
<PB N="7" REF="8">Elective untill the year 1660. Neverthe|le&s;s the <HI>Senatours</HI> generally cho&s;e the El|de&s;t Son of their Soveraign, who from that time forth was Stiled the Prince, and the other of the Kings Sons, the Dukes and Heirs of <HI>Norway.</HI> Now their Electi|on in former times was performed after a very Solemn manner, for as many of the Nobles as were <HI>Senatours,</HI> and had Power of Voting and giving their &s;uffrages, hav|ing pitcht upon &s;ome Commodious place in the Fields, where having placed them|&s;elves in a Circle, upon &s;o many great Stones they pa&s;t their Votes, and having Seated their new Elected Soveraign in the middle, upon a Stone Higher than the Re&s;t, they Saluted Him King. There being to this Day in <HI>Zealand</HI> &s;uch a company of Stones which bear the Name of <HI>King-Seat.</HI> But after the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> had been thus Elective for above Two Hundred years in the pre&s;ent <HI>Oldenburg</HI> Family, the chief Power of Election, as I &s;aid being, in the Nobility, tho&s;e Nobles took this means and occa&s;ion to Capitulate advantages to them&s;elves, as Previous and Preliminary Conditions to the Election, which every &s;ucceeding King was forced to comply with, to the Curtailing, Di&s;poiling, and Weakning of the Crown, and to the pre|judice
<PB N="8" REF="9">and di&s;advantage of the other Or|ders of the Kingdom, in&s;omuch that none but a Noble Man could Buy, Purcha&s;e, or po&s;&s;e&s;s in his own Right any Seigniory or Mannour. A Cittizen or Burgher was not capable of purcha&s;ing more than a Hou&s;e, and perhaps a Guarden and an Or|chard, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;lender bu&s;ine&s;s. The Lands and Revenues of the Crown were let our to Noble Men, it may be not to the Third, often not to the Fourth part of what they were really worth, and yet the King could not rai&s;e the Old Rents, tho the Nobles in the mean while kept the under-tennents Chewing upon a rack Rent. The Pe&s;ants in the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> I&s;land were Villains Reguardant to the Mannors of Noble Men. All publick Offices and ad|vancements were Monopolized by the Nobility. And meer merit without the Circum&s;tances of Nobility of Extraction and Grandure of State, was excluded all Countenance, Protection and Preferment. Thus the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> which &s;hown with &s;o much Lu&s;tre, Renown and Glory in former Ages, was Dwindled almo&s;t in|to an <HI>Ari&s;tocra&s;ie,</HI> and hardly the &s;haddow of what it had been &s;ome Centuries before. But upon the Occa&s;ion of a Warr between <HI>Carolus Gu&s;tavus</HI> King of <HI>Sweeden,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="9"><HI>Frederick</HI> the 3d. King of <HI>Denmark</HI> in the Year 1660. Great Priviledges were pro|po&s;ed and conferred upon the Burgers of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> the better to Encourage them to &s;tand the more Valiantly in Defence of their King and Countrey, lea&s;t the Pro&s;|pect of mending their Circum&s;tances un|der a new Ma&s;ter, &s;hould prevail with them to abandon their Old. Now the Privi|ledges E&s;tabli&s;hed in that juncture were an equal admi&s;&s;ion to Offices and Honours, according to the De&s;erts and Capacities of them and their Children, a Power of Pur|cha&s;ing Lands and Lord&s;hips with the &s;ame Rights as the Nobles. <HI>Copenhagen</HI> to be one of the E&s;tates of the Kingdom, and to have a Suffrage in all publick Councels and Re&s;olves, and the Crown turn'd from Elective to Hereditary, and &s;o freed from the Guardian&s;hip of the Nobility. Thus that juncture, how Menacing &s;oever it &s;eemed to the whole Realm of <HI>Denmark,</HI> yet proved of &s;uch advantage as to rein-&s;tate the King in all that Power that was nece&s;&s;ary for the Defending of His Do|minions again&s;t the Inva&s;ions and In&s;ults of Forreigners, and the Oppre&s;&s;ions and U&s;urpations of one fellow Subject upon an other. Thus the Complexion of that Government is much more Vigorous, and
<PB N="10" REF="10">there is a better Circulation of the Ble&s;|&s;ings to be Enjoyed under a happy Sway, &s;ince this Reformation, than had been for &s;ome Ages before under &s;everal Reigns together.</P>
<P>The account of the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> before the Planting of Chri&s;tianity in that Country, will be found a difficult matter to be Stated, their Chronicles before that time being for the mo&s;t part feign'd and fabulous, as well as that of other Nations. But according to the mo&s;t careful, Judi|cious and Mode&s;te&s;t Relations of that matter, we &s;hall &s;et down the following Catalogue.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Harald</HI> being forced to Fly his Kingdom by the Accomplices of his Bro|ther <HI>Reinferd,</HI> had recour&s;e to the Empe|rour <HI>Ludowick</HI> for Succour, who Furni&s;hed him with Forces for the Rein&s;tating him in his Kingdom, but upon Condition he would abandon his Heatheni&s;me, and be Converted to Chri&s;tianity. Accordingly he was Baptized in the year 826, and was forthwith &s;et again upon his Throne. But not long after he turn'd Idolater a|gain, adn &s;o remained till he was pre|vailed with to Renounce it by St. <HI>Angchar.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Eric</HI> Succeeded his Brother <HI>Harald,</HI> and though he had been Baptized with
<PB N="11" REF="10">him at the Emperours Court, yet he per|&s;ecuted the Chri&s;tians with the &s;ame Cru|elty as his Brother had done in the time of his Relap&s;e. During his Reign, name|ly, about the year 853. the <HI>Danes</HI> are &s;aid to have fir&s;t Invaded <HI>France,</HI> under the Conduct of their General <HI>Rollo,</HI> though others would have <HI>Gotfrid</HI> to have made the fir&s;t Eruption into that Kingdom, and that <HI>Rollo</HI> did not enter <HI>France</HI> till the year 876. and was not E&s;tabli&s;hed peace|ably in <HI>Normandy,</HI> till 889. or 890.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Eric Barn,</HI> or the Child being the only Male left alive of the Royal Family after the Bloody Wars between <HI>Eric</HI> and <HI>Guthorn</HI> King of <HI>Norway.</HI> But he had not been long upon the Throne, before he Re|newed the Per&s;ecution upon the Chri&s;tians with more Cruelty then his Prodece&s;&s;ors had done, de&s;troying more Churches, Bi|&s;hops, and Religious Hou&s;es, then all the other <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Kings put together; He Pro|&s;ecuted his Wars in <HI>Germany</HI> with great Gallantry and Conduct, Slaying with his own Hands <HI>Bruno</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and Twelve Counts. He Departed this Life in the year 902.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Canutus Lodneknut</HI> or the <HI>Hairy</HI> Suc|ceeded his Father <HI>Eric.</HI> In his time every Third Man in <HI>Denmark</HI> went to &s;eek his
<PB N="12" REF="11">Fortune, and tho&s;e who went away thus upon the&s;e Expeditions over-run all <HI>Pru&s;ia, Courland, Semgal,</HI> and other Countries, where they E&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves, and where their Po&s;terity remain unto this day, He Dyed a <HI>Pagan</HI> in the year 912. And was Succeeded by</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Frotho</HI> his Son, though &s;ome &s;ay <HI>Sueno</HI> his Brother Reigned Nine years. He was twenty years King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> being Converted to Chri&s;tianity in <HI>England,</HI> and Dyed a zealous Chri&s;tian, his next Succe&s;&s;ors was,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Gormo, Gormund,</HI> or <HI>Guthram</HI> (Sur|naned <HI>Harte&s;nute,</HI> and <HI>Engelander,</HI> becau&s;e Born in <HI>England:</HI> He with his Attendants was Baptized at <HI>Aal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> our Learned and Pious King <HI>Alfred</HI> being his Godfather, and gave him the Name of <HI>Athel&s;tanes,</HI> and the Kingdom of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Harald</HI> Surnamed <HI>Blaat and</HI> Succeed|ed his Father <HI>Gormo.</HI> In his days did the <HI>Danes</HI> make that Famous Trench between <HI>Gottorp</HI> and <HI>Sle&s;wick</HI> called <HI>Dannewerk.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Sueno</HI> or <HI>Suenotho,</HI> Surnamed <HI>Tui&s;|keg</HI> (that is <HI>Fork'd Beard,</HI>) Succeeded <HI>Harald.</HI> At his fir&s;t coming to the Crown he was a <HI>Pagan,</HI> and Exerci&s;ed great Cru|elty upon the Chri&s;tians, but was after|wards
<PB N="13" REF="11">Converted to Chri&s;tianity, and E|rected three Bi&s;hopricks at <HI>Sle&s;wick, Ri|pen,</HI> and <HI>Arhu&s;en.</HI> He is by &s;ome &s;aid to have Dyed in the year 1012. and was Buryed at <HI>York,</HI> Others in 1014. and In|tombed in <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Canutus</HI> the Great, (Son to <HI>Sueno</HI>) He was at once King of <HI>England, Denmark, Sweeden, Norway, Slavonia,</HI> and <HI>Sambland,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay too, King or Duke of <HI>Normandy.</HI> He was Buryed at <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> in the year 1036. after he had been Seaven and twen|ty years King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> twenty four of <HI>England,</HI> and Seaven of <HI>Norway,</HI> and was Suoceeded in the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> by his Son.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Hardi-Cnute,</HI> who within four years obtained the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> upon the Death of his Brother <HI>Harald.</HI> He Dyed in <HI>England</HI> in the year 1041. and was Buryed by his Father in the Cathedral of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Magnus,</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> by main force upon the Death of <HI>Hardi-Cnute,</HI> pre|tending a Contract that Entituled him to it, but had it not long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He Dyed in the year 1048. and left the Crown to</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Sueno E&s;thret,</HI> Son of one <HI>&V;lf</HI> an
<PB N="14" REF="12"><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Earl. He Departed this Life in the year 1074. and left behind him five Sons, who all of them Enjoyed Succe&s;|&s;ively their Fathers Crown.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Harald Sueno</HI>'s Elde&s;t Son, Swayed the Scepter no longer then two years, be|ing an ea&s;ie efferninate, timerous Prince. So that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> laid hold of the Juncture, &s;hook off the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Yoak without any great trouble.</P>
<P N="14">14. St. <HI>Canutus,</HI> the Second Son of King <HI>Swain</HI> in the year 1088. was Inhumanly Murdered by his own Subject at St. <HI>Albans</HI> Church in <HI>Oden&s;ee</HI> (a City in the I&s;le of <HI>Funen</HI>) which he had made his Sanctua|ry. Now his Brother <HI>Olaf</HI> longing for the Crown, Fomented a Rebellion again&s;t <HI>Canutus,</HI> and effected his de&s;igns, by the means of the Kings commanding his Sub|jects to pay Tyths, according to the Cu|&s;tom of other Nations.

<PB N="33" REF="21">unweildy as they were in the foregoing Ages, but readier either to Attack, Fly, or Pur&s;ue. No Prince in Chri&s;tendom is bet|ter Furni&s;hed with all things nece&s;&s;ary for the fitting out a Fleet, <HI>Norway</HI> and his other Territories; affording him all the Equipage requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e. He is al&s;o pretty well &s;tored with Sea-men, and indeed all his Dominions being I&s;lands, or Maritime Provinces, the Inhabitants are almo&s;t Naturally Mariners. Never|thele&s;s this Monarch is &s;ometimes forced to have recour&s;e to &s;trangers for Recruits of Men; the <HI>Northern</HI> Countreys not a|bounding &s;o in People as they did in for|mer times, when they Spawn'd and pour|ed forth &s;uch &s;hoales as over ran not only mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> but continued their Incur&s;ions into <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> But whether this be imputed to the Aboli&s;hing of Poligamy, which the Introducing Chri&s;tianity did re|form, or that the prevailing of Luxury has debilitated their pri&s;tine Vigour, and ren|dred them the le&s;s fit for generation, cer|tain it is, that no parts of <HI>Europe</HI> are now &s;o thin of Inhabitants, as the&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Regions, and that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> has not People enough to Man out &s;o many Ships He would be otherwi&s;e ca|pable to fit out: For without Exhau&s;ting

The Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> &s;ince the Reformation made in that State, in the year 1660 hath a Perogative of as large extent as any Monarch in Chri&s;tendom, having Power without con&s;ulting the States, or his Senate to <HI>Declare War, make Peace, &s;end and receive Amba&s;&s;adors, make Leagues and Treaties with any Foreign States, I&s;&s;ue out Commi&s;&s;ions for the Rai&s;ing of Men both by Sea and Land,</HI> di&s;po&s;e of all Ca&s;tles, Fortre&s;&s;es, Ports, Havens, Ships of War, Ma|gazines, Ammunition, and publick Moneys; appoint the Mettal, Weight, Purity and Value thereof, and by His Order can make any Foreign Coyn, to be the cur|rant Money of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>He can by his Letters Patent, Erect <HI>New Di&s;tricts, Bi&s;hopricks, &V;niver&s;ities, Cities, Burroughs, Colledges, Ho&s;pitals, Schools, Fairs, Markets, Courts of Ju&s;tice, Forre&s;ts, Cha&s;es, Free-Warrens,</HI> He can Enfranchi&s;e an Alien, and render him a <HI>Deni&s;on,</HI> Enabling him to purcha&s;e Hou&s;es and Lands, and bear Offices.

<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> has all &s;uch things as are proper <HI>To a Monarch, as Crowns, Scepters, Purple Robe,</HI> and <HI>Holy &V;nction,</HI> and acknowledgeth no Superiour but God, nor holdeth his Kingdom in Va&s;&s;a|lage, nor receiveth his Inve&s;titure or In|&s;talment from another.

<P>Tho till &s;ome of late Creation, the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Nobles had neither the Titles of Dutchies, Marqui&s;&s;ates, Counties, nor Barrony, as other States; nor do they Quarter their Armes, yet tis Cu&s;tomary for many of them to be Dub|bed Knights, upon any Signal piece of Ser|vice rendred to their Prince or Countrey.</P>
<P>Two Orders of Knight-hood they have in <HI>Denmark,</HI> that of the <HI>Elephant</HI> and that of <HI>Dancbrogh.</HI></P>
<P>That of the <HI>Elephant</HI> was fir&s;t in&s;tituted upon the occa&s;ion of King <HI>Christian</HI> the fir&s;t going in a kind of Pilgrimage to <HI>Rome,</HI> when as he was inve&s;ted by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fourth with this Order, in Remembrance of our Lord and Saviour, and at the &s;ame time it was Ordain'd that the Succeeding Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> &s;hould have a Succe&s;|&s;ive Right to be Soveraigns of this Order. Whereupon the fore&s;aid King <HI>Christian,</HI> Built the Stately Chappel of the three
<PB N="52" REF="31">Kings, in the Cathedral at <HI>Ro&s;childt</HI> where the &s;olemnities of the Order were to be held, and the Knights obliged to A&s;&s;emble, for the choo&s;ing a new Member upon the Death of any of their Fraternity. Into the Number whereof &s;everal Kings, Prin|ces and Noble Men have been Admitted. The chief En&s;igne of the Order, was the Figure of an <HI>Elephant,</HI> on who&s;e &s;ide (within a Rundle) was repre&s;ented a Crown of Thorns, with three Nails all Bloody; in Honour and Memory of the Pa&s;&s;ion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. The Knights were obliged to the performance of Acts of Piety, <HI>Alms-deeds,</HI> and certain Ceremonies particularly on tho&s;e days on which they wore the En&s;ignes of their Or|der. Some of the Kings of <HI>Denmark</HI> have been very Zealous to rai&s;e the Honour of this Order to the Highe&s;t E&s;teem, and e&s;pecially their King <HI>John,</HI> who wore the En&s;ignes of it on every Solemn Fe&s;tival, and &s;o promoted its value, that our King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight, and King <HI>James</HI> the Fifth of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were content to be of the Fraternity. Some <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Writers are not of Opinion, that it re eived its fir&s;t In&s;ti|tution, when <HI>Christian</HI> the Fir&s;t had tho&s;e many Honours conferr'd on him by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fourth, but that the Badge
<PB N="53" REF="31">was a meer Millitary En&s;igne, formerly be&s;towed as a Memorial and Incite|ment to the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Princes, for the De|fence and promoting of Chri&s;tianity a|gain&s;t the Infidels. Heretofore the Knights wore a Collar of Gold, Compo&s;ed of <HI>E|lephants</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> fa&s;hioned &s;omewhat like <HI>Cro&s;&s;es Ancrees,</HI> at which Hung the Picture of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> to the middle holding <HI>Christ</HI> in Her Arms, and &s;urround|ed with a <HI>Glory</HI> of Sun Beams. But at this day they only wear a Blew Ribbond, at which hangs an <HI>Elephant Enamell'd</HI> white, Adorned with four large Diamonds &s;et in the middle. Tho&s;e <HI>Elephants</HI> worn by the Knights, in the days of <HI>Christian</HI> the Fourth, had in the &s;ame place within a Circle the Letter <HI>C.</HI> and in the Heart thereof the figure of 4. made to &s;ignifie <HI>Christianus Quartus.</HI> The Kings of <HI>Den|mark</HI> have Generally conferred this Ho|nour on the days of their Coronation, both upon the Nobles and Senatours of the Kingdome. <HI>Frederick</HI> the Third, brought into u&s;e an Embroidered <HI>Glory</HI> of Silver Purl, wrought upon the left &s;ide of their Cloak or Ve&s;t, on which was Em|broidered two Crowns within a Rundle, bearing this <HI>Motto, Deus Providebit.</HI> But the <HI>Motto</HI> has changed with the Soveraign,

This Or|der&punc; was Continued till the Relique was lo&s;t it &s;olfe in <HI>Ditmar&s;h,</HI> after which it was for a long while wholly laid a&s;ide, until revived again in the year 1673. by the pre&s;ent King <HI>Christian</HI> the Fifth. This Prince ordain'd that the Knights of this Order, of which Him&s;elf is one, &s;hould Wear an Enamell'd Cro&s;s Edg'd round with Red, hung in a &s;tring of the &s;ame Colour, reaching from the Right Shoul|der to the Left &s;ide.</P>

But &s;ince the Reformation of the Government in the year 1660. The number of them is very much Retrenched.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t the Kingdome of <HI>Denmark</HI> lay confu&s;ed and broken into &s;everal parts, all the Provinces had not all the &s;ame Law, but were Governed by peculiar Statutes. Whence we read of <HI>Leges Scanicae, Leges Sialandice,</HI> and the like. But when they came to be reunited under on Head, they became all Subject to the &s;ame Law. The
<PB N="64" REF="37">Laws now in u&s;e were compiled into one Body, which they call the <HI>Iyd&s;e Lowbog,</HI> or the Book of the Laws of <HI>Juitland,</HI> and E&s;tabli&s;hed by King <HI>Waldemar</HI> the Second. But neverthele&s;s &s;ometimes changed accor|ding to the Circum&s;tances of the juncture. Thus Murder was formerly puni&s;hed, only with a pecuniary Mulct, but now with Death.

<P>The <HI>Danes</HI> u&s;ed formerly, and do &s;till, in &s;ome parts of <HI>Juitland,</HI> to A&s;&s;emble eve|ry Pari&s;h by them&s;elves once a Year in the Fields, to Determine all Controver&s;ies by Twelve Select Men, from whom an Ap|peal lay to the Judge of the Province, upon the inreconciliation of the Parties, and thence to the Supream Court of Ju&s;ti|ces, and this cu&s;tome of a Jury of Twelve Men, was undoubtedly derived to the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> from the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Heathen Danes,</HI> did likewi&s;e de|termine Controver&s;ies by Duels, wherein the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e was Demon&s;tra|ted by the &s;ucce&s;s. But Chri&s;tianity Abo|li&s;hed this Cu&s;tome, when one <HI>Loppo</HI> upon
<PB N="65" REF="37">its fir&s;t Planting, for the confirming the truth of His Doctrine, took up with his bare Hands, Glowing-Hot Barrs of Iron, without the lea&s;t Harm to the Admiration of all the Beholders.

Two doors have they in the&s;e Hou&s;es, the fore door, which is of common u&s;e and entrance for the whole Family, and the back door, thro which the Men pa&s;s, and that only when they go a Hunting, Fi&s;hing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but all Women are forbid it, either becau&s;e that Sex is thought to be very inau&s;picious to tho&s;e Exerci&s;es,

The&s;e Hou&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;everal Partitions, not by any Wall, but only by great Po&s;ts or Loggs of Wood laid upon the Ground; their Fire place is in the middle, about which the whole Fa|mily lies, either upon the bare Earth or upon the Skins of Rein Deer, Bears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When they have a mind to change their Habitation, which they do con&s;tantly twice a Year, they unty this their Tent, take it away with them, and pitch it in a more convenient place. Another Sort of Hou&s;es among them, are their Granaries and Store Hou&s;es; which that they may the better &s;ecure their Provi&s;ion from wild bea&s;ts and vermin, they do not build upon the Ground, but at &s;ome di&s;tance from it, upon the bole or &s;tump of a large Tree.</P>
<P>The Ordinary Diet of the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> is either of Fi&s;h or the Fle&s;h of their Rein Deer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which they eat &s;ometimes raw, &s;ometimes boil'd, but for the mo&s;t part dried in the air. Bread and Salt are
<PB N="113" REF="60">unknown to them, in&s;tead of Bread they make u&s;e of their dry'd Fi&s;h, groun'd &s;mall like Meal: And for Salt they take the in|ward of the Pine Trees, which they dry in the Sun, and putting it into Boxes bury it a &s;mall depth in the Ground, then after it hath lain there a competent time, they kindle a fire upon the place and &s;o dry it; whereby it becomes of a redi&s;h co|lour, a plea&s;ant ta&s;te, and gives a good gu&s;t and reli&s;h to their cour&s;er Food.</P>
<P>Their general Drink is pure Water, which in the Winter time they keep in their Hou&s;es continually hot, and &s;o drink it. Of late they are grown ac|quainted with Brandy and Liquors of that nature, which are in great vogue with them, and which they drink only on their Holy Days and at their Weddings. Their Dining Room is commonly in the middle of their Tent about the Fire, with|out Tables, Di&s;hes, Spoons or Trenchers, and &s;uch &s;ort of Implements; each lays his Commons upon his Mittens, and when he has eat it, &s;ays Grace, &s;hakes his Camrades by the right Hand, which is their Charity Cup; and &s;o every one trudges about his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Their Garments are very cour&s;e and mean, made either of the Skins of Wild Bea&s;ts, (frequently in u&s;e among&s;t them)
<PB N="114" REF="61">or the wor&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, which they wear only on Holy Days and at their Publick Fairs.

Their Shoes, as the the re&s;t of their ordinary Garments, are made of the &s;hins of rein Deer, Elks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the hair outward, the toe bending &s;omewhat upward, and according to the ancient Cu&s;tom, ending with a &s;harp point: On their Heads they have a Cap made of the Skin of &s;ome Fowl, as Gee&s;e, Ducks, or the like, but particularly make choice of the Loom for that purpo&s;e, and like the ancient <HI>Germans</HI> taking the Feathers, Head and Wings along vvith it. The Garb proper to Women is a large vvide Govvn, made either of Cloth or Skins, according to the Per&s;ons Condition and E&s;tate: this Govvn is gathered clo&s;e in the middle, and decked vvith &s;everal Figures of Birds, Bea&s;ts, and the like, vvhich they vvork very prettily and vvith great art.</P>

<P>Their Gods common to the whole Countrey be <HI>Thor</HI> or <HI>Thiermes,</HI> that is, <HI>Thunderer</HI> or <HI>Noi&s;e-maker,</HI> they honour him with endearing and lofty Titles, as, <HI>Great-Grand-Father</HI> and the like; they fancy his abode to be in the Clouds, and that he di&s;po&s;es of Wind, Rain, Thun|der, good and bad Weather, as he thinks fitting: He it is they think gives Life or Death, Health or Sickne&s;s, Ble&s;&s;ings or Sufferings: They make his Image of
<PB N="116" REF="62">Beech-Tree, ea&s;ily turning the &s;toops which &s;hoot out from the root into the likene&s;s of a Mans Head, Arms, Feet, and the re&s;t, laying by him a Bow, Arrows, and a Hammer to kill the mi&s;chievous <HI>Demons.</HI> They place their Images upon a Table in a piece of Ground dedicated to that Service, not far from their Habita|tions, the Table &s;erves them for an Al|tar, and the Boughs of Birch and Pine for a Temple. They &s;uffer not their Women to be pre&s;ent at the Sacrifices they offer to him, looking upon that as very Criminal. But they never offer Sacrifice till they have enquired of their God whether he will accept it or no: And this they do with a certain In&s;trument which they call <HI>Kannees,</HI> re&s;embling much the old fa&s;hi|oned Drums, on which they picture &s;eve|ral of their Gods: The whole manner of the Ceremony being as followeth, They pull off &s;ome of the hair at the bottom of the Bea&s;ts Neck which is to be &s;acrificed, and bind it to a Ring which is fa&s;tned to the Drum, then one of them beats the Drum, and all the re&s;t &s;ing the&s;e words, <HI>What &s;aye&s;t thou, O great and &s;acred god, doth thou accept this Sacrifice whic we de|&s;ign to offer unto thee?</HI> And while &s;ome Chant the&s;e Words, others repeat the Name of the Mountain where they are;
<PB N="117" REF="62">then if the Ring re&s;ts on that part of the Drum where the God is pictured, they take it for granted the God is plea&s;ed; and &s;o proceed to the Ceremony; or el&s;e cary the Sacrifice to <HI>Storejunkar</HI> or &s;ome other God, u&s;ing the like Form of words, <HI>Father god will you have my &s;acrifice?</HI> Their u&s;ual Sacrifices are Rein-Deers, Cats, Lambs and Hens. The u&s;ual time of their offering up their Sacrifices is in <HI>Autumn,</HI> becau&s;e that Winter and Nights approach|ing, they think they have the more need of their Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Their way of Con&s;ecrating is in this manner, Fir&s;t they Sacrifice the Rein-Deer, then taking out his Bones they anoint the Idol with the Blood and Fat, and bury the Fle&s;h and Bones under ground, but this they do not till the God has approved of the Sacrifice, after which they bind the Rein-Deer be|hind the hou&s;e, then with a &s;harp knife they run him thro the heart, and gather the heart blood, wherewith they anoint the I|dol, into a Ve&s;&s;el. After that having placed the Images right, making a new one eve|ry time they &s;acrifice, and &s;etting them in order behind one another, the la&s;t al|ways hindmo&s;t, they approach with reve|rence to it, anoint the Head and Back all over with the blood, but on his Brea&s;t they only draw &s;everal cro&s;&s;es, behind him
<PB N="118" REF="63">they place the Skull, Feet and Horns of the &s;acrificed Deer; before him they place a Coffer made of the bark of Birch, into whic they put a bit of every Member of the <HI>Rein Deer,</HI> with&s;ome of the <HI>Fat;</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> they convert to their pri|vate u&s;es.</P>
<P>The next of their Principal <HI>Gods</HI> is <HI>Store|junkar,</HI> that is, <HI>Great Commander,</HI> he they &s;ay pre&s;ides peculiarly over all Bea&s;ts and Cattle; this Gods Name they reverence with the highe&s;t re&s;pect, and pay him fre|quenter, if not greater Devotion than o|ther Gods, for they &s;uppo&s;e him to be their <HI>Thor</HI> or <HI>Thiermes</HI> Lieutenant, and wor&s;hip him becau&s;e that they think they receive all their <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> thro his <HI>hands,</HI> and that all <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Cattle</HI> are &s;ubject to his <HI>Will,</HI> and he governs <HI>them</HI> as <HI>Thiermes</HI> does <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Spirits;</HI> wherefore he can give them to whom he will, and none can re|ceive them without his plea&s;ure: Thus, <HI>Thiermes</HI> and <HI>Storejunkar</HI> are the two pe|culiar <HI>Gods</HI> of the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> the one hav|ing the <HI>Dominion</HI> over the <HI>Men,</HI> the other over <HI>Bea&s;ts;</HI> one be&s;tows life, the other all things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance of it. When they offer <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to <HI>Storejunkar,</HI> which is likewi&s;e a <HI>Male Deer,</HI> they fir&s;trun a <HI>Red Thred</HI> thro his <HI>Right Ear,</HI> and bind <HI>Him,</HI> and &s;acrifice <HI>Him</HI> in the place where
<PB N="611" REF="63">they did the like to <HI>Thor, pre&s;erving</HI> the <HI>blood</HI> al&s;o in a Ve&s;&s;el; then he who performs the Ceremony takes the <HI>Horns</HI> and the <HI>Bones</HI> of the <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Neck,</HI> with the <HI>Feet</HI> and <HI>Hoofes,</HI> and caries them to the <HI>Moun|tain</HI> of that <HI>Storejunkar,</HI> for whom the <HI>Sa|crifice</HI> was de&s;igned: When he comes near the <HI>&s;acred &s;tone</HI> he reverently uncovers his head and bowes his body, paying all the Ceremonies of Re&s;pect and Honour, then he anoints the <HI>Stone</HI> with the <HI>Fat</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> and places the <HI>Horns</HI> behind it; un|to the right <HI>Horn</HI> they fa&s;ten the <HI>Rein-Deers Yard,</HI> and to the left &s;ome red <HI>Thred</HI> wrought upon <HI>Tin</HI> with a little piece of <HI>Silver.</HI></P>
<P>The third and la&s;t of their Principal Gods is the <HI>Sun,</HI> whom they call <HI>Baiw,</HI> and wor&s;hip him chiefly for his Light and Heat; al&s;o becau&s;e they believe him to be the Author of Generation, and that all things are made by his means, e&s;pecially their <HI>Rein-Deers,</HI> of whom and their Young, they think he hath a peculiar care to cheri&s;h by his Heat, and bring &s;uddenly to Strength and Maturity.

And this Sa|crifice differs from the <HI>Other,</HI> in that there are neither Images erected here, nor Horns, the <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> not being come to their growth. But that there may be &s;ome ris&s;emblance of the Sun, they place their chief Bones of the Sacrifice upon the Table in a Circle.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Laplanders</HI> are not more nototorious for their Idolatry than for their Witchcraft; anci|ent and modern Writers a&s;&s;erting that they have attained to &s;o great a skill in Enchantments and Magick, as that among &s;everal other &s;trange Effects of their Art, they could &s;top Ships when under full Sail, nay and could either by their looks, words, or &s;ome other wicked Artifice, to en&s;nare and bewitch Men, as to deprive them of the u&s;e of Limbs and Rea&s;on, and very often bring them into extream peril of their lives. Now one of the main Rea&s;ons and Motives of their &s;o doing, is, that every one thinks it the &s;afe&s;t way to defend him&s;elf from the injurious and malicious de&s;igns of others; for they com|monly profe&s;s that their knowledg in the&s;e things is ab&s;olutley nece&s;&s;ary, for their own &s;e|curity. Wherefore they have Teachers, Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="121" REF="64">in this Science; and Parents in their la&s;t Will bequeath to their Children as the greate part of their E&s;tate, tho&s;e Spirits and Devils that have been any ways &s;erviceable to them in their life time. Now as to the bequeathing their Familiars to their Children, they con&s;ider it as the only means to rai&s;e their Family, &s;o that they excel one another in this Art, according to the largene&s;s of the Legacies they receive. By which it is apparent that every Family hath peculiar Spirits, and of different and quite contrary Na|tures from tho&s;e of others; and as each hou&s;e, &s;o has each &s;ingle per&s;on his particular Spirits, &s;ometimes one, two or more; but there are a &s;et number of ob&s;equious Spirits, beyond which none hath. Neverthele&s;s &s;ome of the&s;e Spirits will not engage them&s;elves without great Soli|citation and earne&s;t Entreaties, whereas others will readily offer them&s;elves to little Children, when they find them capacitated for their turn, &s;o that &s;everal of the Inhabitants are almo&s;t na|turally Magicians; for when the Devil takes a liking to any per&s;on in his Infancy, as a fit In|&s;trument for his purpo&s;es, he pre&s;ently &s;eizes on him by a Di&s;ea&s;e, in which he haunts him with &s;everal Apparitions, from whence accord|ing to the Capacity of his Years and Under&s;tand|ing, he knows what belongs to the Art. Tho&s;e who are thus taken a &s;econd time &s;ee more Vi|&s;ions, and gain far greater knowledge. If they are &s;eized a third time, which is &s;eldom with|out great torment or utmo&s;t danger of their life, the Devil appears to them in all his &s;hapes, by which they arrive to the very Perfection of his Art, and become &s;o knowing, that without a
<PB N="122" REF="65">Drum they can &s;ee things at greate&s;t Di&s;tances, and are &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Devil, that they &s;ee them even again&s;t their will. And a certain <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Author tells a &s;trange Story of a <HI>Laplan|der,</HI> who upon complaint made again&s;t him for keeping a Drum, brought it, and delivered it up to him, and with Tears confe&s;t, that tho he thus willingly parted with it, and never intended to provide another, yet he &s;hould &s;till be tor|mented with the &s;ame fearful and trouble&s;ome Vi&s;ions about future Events, which (tho' his Eyes were &s;hut) were always pre&s;ent to his im|agination, giving him a true and particular Re|lation of whatever had happened to him in his Journey to <HI>Lapland.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Art it &s;elf, it is according to the di|ver&s;ity of In&s;truments u&s;ed in it, divided into two parts, one comprehends all that to which the Drum belongs; the other, tho&s;e things to which Knots, Darts, Spells, Conjurations, and the like refer: The Drum is peculiar to the <HI>Lap|landers,</HI> and called by them <HI>Kannus</HI> or <HI>Quochdas,</HI> made of a hollow piece of Wood, and mu&s;t be either of Pine, Fir, or Birch Tree, which grows to &s;uch a particular place, and turns directly according to the Suns Cour&s;e; which is when the Grain of the Wood running from the bottom to the top of the Tree; winds it &s;elf from the right hand to the left. It is made hollow on one &s;ide, upon which they &s;tretch a Skin, fa&s;ten|ing it with wooden Pegs; on the other they make two holes to hold it by; the &s;hape of the upper part is Oval, about half an Ell in Diameter; upon the Skin they paint &s;everal Pictures in red, &s;tain'd with the Bark of an Alder|tree; and through the middle they draw
<PB N="123" REF="65">&s;ome cro&s;s Lines in every Quarter, of which they place their Attendants; neither do they alwaies ob&s;erve the &s;ame Gods, and the &s;ame Methods. But this is ob&s;er|vable, that they commonly paint the Sun in the middle, their Gods above, and the earthly things under him. And &s;ince Chri|&s;tianity was introduced among them, many of them do place upon their Drum the Image of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his Apo&s;tles, owning him to be, or to have the power of one of their Gods. Moreover, they alter their figures according to the occa&s;ion of the inquiry, retaining the general Notions the Heathens had of their Deity, that &s;everal of them had peculiar Offices and Employ|ments. But now, though in many places they have been forced to abandon their Drums, yet do they practice all their knots, have their familiars in the &s;hape of Flies, Bees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But chiefly their black Cats (whom they not only Con&s;ult at home about their Dome&s;tick affairs, but take with them al&s;o in their huntings; tho in the depths of Snow;) and their Diaboli|cal Exerci&s;es, which are performed &s;ome|times with, &s;ometimes without a Drum: If with a Drum, the Sorcerer kreels down, and having a bunch of Rings, and other pieces of Bra&s;s laid in the middle of
<PB N="124" REF="66">the Drum, he beats with a Con&s;ecrated Hammer, &s;o &s;trongly, that the Rings dance upon it, by the re&s;ting of which upon &s;uch a figure, they draw forth an an&s;wer to what they would de&s;ire to know; but if this be not &s;atisfactory, then the Drummer puts him&s;elf by dancing and howling into a vio|lent motion, till he falls down, which he chu&s;es to do upon his Drum; and then he lies without motion and di&s;turbance, and without &s;en&s;e, till he voluntarily ri&s;e again, and gives an&s;wer to what is de&s;ired. This kind of Divination is chiefly u&s;ed, when &s;omething at a great di&s;tance is de&s;ired to be known. The Stories are &s;o frequent, and from per&s;ons not over credulous, that there is no room left to doubt of what they &s;ay concerning the&s;e Sorceries. A|mong&s;t other In&s;tances thereof, this is rela|ted by a Per&s;on of worth and under&s;tand|ing; who being one time at Dinner with his Father, Mother, Brother, Si&s;ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> his Fathers knife was mi&s;&s;ing upon the &s;udden, and could not be found, till two years after a Coun&s;in of his returning from being Fa|ctor in, or near <HI>Lapland,</HI> brought it with him, telling them, that out of curio&s;ity he had employed a <HI>Laplander,</HI> a pretender to great skill in this Art, to bring him notice of the health and condition of that Family;
<PB N="125" REF="66">who after he had lain &s;ometime in this now de&s;cribed manner, brought him news, that they were all well, that he found them at Dinner; and that to confirm his Rela|tion, he brought away that knife, which he delivered to the Merchant, and the Mer|chant brought home now to his Uncle.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid before, they &s;ometimes pra|ctice the&s;e Sorceries without the Drum, u&s;ing in&s;tead of it commonly Strings or Darts, by which they advantage their friends, or injure their enemies at their plea&s;ure. The &s;trings they make u&s;e of to rai&s;e or quell the Winds, which they &s;ell to Mariners for that purpo&s;e. They con|&s;i&s;t commonly of three knots; the fir&s;t of which being untied, affords a favourable Wind; the &s;econd a brisk Gale; and the third a violent Storm; as has been approved to the great peril &amp; lo&s;s of &s;everal Seafaring per&s;ons, that have given account of it in pub|lick. By their Darts, which are &s;hort Cylin|ders of Lead; they wound any one who hath done them an injury, or their malice puts them upon to a&s;&s;ault: The&s;e are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t powerful Charms of any, &amp; upon occa&s;ion to have &s;plit Rocks, level'd Moun|tains, and &s;uch like incredible Exploits.</P>
<P>They have Matrimony in great venera|tion, it being &s;eldom known they commit
<PB N="126" REF="67">Adultery, but if &s;uch a crime be once di&s;|covered, it is &s;everely puni&s;hed. Now, when ever any man purpo&s;es to marry, his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is, to make inquiry after a Maid well &s;tock'd with <HI>Rain-Deers;</HI> for the <HI>Lap|landers</HI> have a Cu&s;tom of be&s;towing upon their Children &s;oon after their Birth, &s;ome certain number of tho&s;e <HI>Rain Deers,</HI> and their Encrea&s;e is accounted of not as the Parents E&s;tate, but the Child's Portion. Thus &s;he, who has the greate&s;t number of them, is in the faire&s;t way to have a Hu&s;|band. Nor have they regard to any thing el&s;e, not minding either good Breed|ing or Beauty, or other the common al|lurements of Wooers. Now the Spark ha|ving pitched upon a Mi&s;tre&s;s, informs one of his neare&s;t friends of his Intentions, and de&s;ires him to be his Spokes-man: This Kin&s;man of his &s;ollicits the bu&s;ine&s;s with her Father, Mother, and Kindred, pre&s;ent|ing and cajoling them with Brandy and Tobacco, or what el&s;e is mo&s;t in reque&s;t in order to the purcha&s;ing their Con&s;ent. After this the Suitor has an Invitation to the Hut where the Bride dwells, where he agrees to certain Articles offered by her friends, and then li&s;ts him&s;elf for a whole year in her Fathers &s;ervice; though fir&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="67">pre&s;enting the Father with a Silver Cup, &amp; Kettle of either Copper or Alchimy, and a Bed, or at lea&s;t hand&s;om Bedding. To the Mother he gives a Girdle of Silver, a Robe of Honour, and a Whisk, which they wear about their neck, and let it hang down to their brea&s;t, interlaced all about with Bo&s;&s;es of Silver. Be&s;ides, he be&s;tows upon the Brothers and Si&s;ters, and all the Kindred, Silver Spoons, Silver Bo&s;&s;es, and &s;ome other &s;uch knick knacks of Silver; for each of them mu&s;t be pre&s;ented with &s;ome gifts by the Bridegroom, if he mean to obtain his Bride. But the time of his years Service being expired, he takes to him his Wife, and proceeds to the Solem|nizing the Marriage, which is ever per|formed with great Pomp and Ceremony, according to their abilities. The Bride is &s;pruc'd up with the Choice&s;t Ornaments they can get, as pieces of Tin and Alchi|my, with &s;everal Rings of Fi&s;h Bones and Bra&s;s; though a Bride of the Richer &s;ort fir&s;t loo&s;es her hair, and the Fillet where|with &s;he bound it up together before, &s;he gives to the Virgin that is next akin to her: Afterwards on her bare head and loo&s;e hair &s;he puts a kind of Silver Fillet, guilt over, or two, &s;uch as is the womens Cu&s;tom to wear at other times, in&s;tead
<PB N="128" REF="68">of a Garland or Coronet, which is practi&s;ed in <HI>Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and other Northern Countrys, &s;o that by how much this Fillet is loo&s;er then to environ only her head; &s;o much it hangs down the more behind. Like|wi&s;e about the middle they put on a Silver Girdle, the Bridegroom too is as &s;pruice as po&s;&s;ible he can be, having the be&s;t cloaths on he can get at his own charges, and tho&s;e girded with a Silver Girdle. Thus adorn'd is the Bride dragg'd to Church, or to the Prie&s;t, &s;eeming to go with much reluctance, and there is married according to the u&s;ual Forms. In former times Matrimony was &s;olemnized by the Parents and Friends (the Father &s;upplying the place of the Prie&s;t, by &s;triking of Flint and Steel, the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">te&s;t Emblem, as they thought, of a mar|ried life; for as the Flint conceals within it Fire, which by concu&s;&s;ion breaks forth; &s;o in both Sexes there is life hid, which by the mutual coupling of Marriage, is propa|gated at la&s;t to be a living Off-&s;pring. Poligamy is not allowed of among them, a man being &s;uffered to have but one Wife at a time. Nor do they contract Wed|lock without the con&s;ent of their friends, to whom they refer them&s;elves wholly as to that matter. Thus a &s;toln Wedding is never heard of among them, neither
<PB N="129" REF="68">are they &s;uffered to trade for them&s;elves, until they have &s;erved as Bond&s;men their Father-in-law for a certain time, which Cu&s;tom does &s;eem to be derived from the mo&s;t Primitive Times and Nations.</P>
<P>Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers are very rarely known in this Country, the purene&s;s of the Air &s;till correcting the malignity of them, when they happen to be introdu|ced. Pluri&s;ies, Inflammations, and Sorene&s;s of the Eyes, they are &s;ometimes troubled with, which la&s;t they cure by drinking a Decoction of the Root of <HI>Mo&s;s,</HI> or the Stalk of <HI>Angelica,</HI> in the Whey of the Milk of their <HI>Rain-Deer.</HI> They cure wounds with no other Ointments or Plai&s;ter than that of Ro&s;in, which the Trees &s;weat out: If a Member be benummed with cold, the the Chee&s;e made of <HI>Rain-Deers</HI> Milk, af|fords the pre&s;ente&s;t Remedy to it; they thru&s;t a red hot Iron into it, and with the Fat of the Chee&s;e that in&s;tantly di&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> from it, they anoint the part affected, with incredible &s;ucce&s;s; and when troubled with any Pains or Aches in their Joynts, or Body, as the Gout; Cramp, Sciatica, or the like, they ea&s;e and cure them by ap|plying a Cau&s;tick of the flame of any Chips to the affected place.

<P>But when they perceive any one near Death, they &s;end either for the Prie&s;t, if near at hand, to prepare him for his Di&s;|&s;olution, or el&s;e for a Magician, who is &s;aid to be able to re&s;olve them by his Drums, of the very hour and manner of any mans Death. In ca&s;e he dies, they fancy his Soul is re&s;tle&s;s till his Body be buried, which for that rea&s;on they do with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t, commonly carrying him to the neare&s;t Wood or Cave which they pitch upon for a burying-place, &s;el|dom interring them in Church-yards, by rea&s;on of their remotene&s;s. The dead Corps they carry upon a Sledge, the per&s;on who conducts being particularly intreated

When they come with the Body to the Cave, they ca&s;t it in, and the Sledge after it, or el&s;e cover it with great Logs of Wood, to de|fend it from wild Bea&s;ts, never failing to lay by it a Hatchet, a Flint and Steel, that if ever they come to ri&s;e again in the dark|ne&s;s, they &s;hall have great need of &s;pring+ing a light; to which the Flint &amp; Steel may help them; as likewi&s;e there will be occa|&s;ion for a ready way wherein they may travel to Heaven, to which purpo&s;e their Hatchet may &s;tand them in&s;tead, them e&s;pecially that are buried in thick Woods, that if any Trees ob&s;truct their pa&s;&s;age, they may cut them down.

<P>The people are humble and civil to one another, and e&s;pecially Courteous to Stran|gers; Loyal, and liberal in their Contribu|tions to the Government, and Charitable to the Poor: they are moderate and fru|gal in their Dyet, which is chiefly on Milk, Fi&s;h, Gruel, and Fle&s;h. They dry both their Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h in the Wind, having Wind hou&s;es for that purpo&s;e, when the fle&s;h is dryed, they boyl it in Water, and thicken the Broth with Barley Meal; which is reckon'd one of their greate&s;t Delicacies.</P>
<P>As for their Apparel, the Men wear woollen &s;hirts, flannel Trowces, and Wa&s;t|coats, with &s;hort loo&s;e Coats of the &s;ame. The Women rich and poor, go all alike, in &s;trait Growns without skirts. Their

<HI>Ingulph</HI> a <HI>Norwegian</HI> Baron, is &s;aid to have brought the fir&s;t Inhabitants into this I&s;land, in the year 874. though there is rea&s;on to believe it was peopled before that time, &amp; known too, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> it being acknowledged, that the Ancient <HI>I&s;elan|ders,</HI> called the <HI>Iri&s;h Papey,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> part of their I&s;le, as mo&s;t frequented by <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Merchants <HI>Papey.</HI> Be&s;ides, there is &s;till &s;everal remains and monuments of Idolatry in this I&s;land, which &s;how its ancient Inha|bitants to have been Pagans, whereas the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians</HI> at the time of their fir&s;t &s;etling there were Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The modern Natives are for the mo&s;t part plain and &s;imple, living on what is gi|ven them by nature, without the help of Art, more then that of making Chee&s;e and Butter: the Mountains &s;erving them for Towns, and the Rivers for Drink, and they quarter with their Hor&s;es and their Oxen under one and the &s;ame roof. As they do not &s;tand in need of either Phy&s;ick or Phy|&s;ician, &s;o neither do they u&s;e any, their temperance in meat and drink, and the na|turally &s;trong con&s;titution of their Bodies enabling many of them to attain to the age of 150 years, and more, Nay, <HI>Olaus Magnus</HI> affirms they commonly live to the age of three hundred years, and <HI>Blykenius</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="75">reports, that he &s;aw a man in <HI>I&s;eland,</HI> who told him that he had then lived two hund|red years.</P>
<P>Their habitations are for the mo&s;t part of timber, roofed with &s;lags or turfs, with a hole on the &s;ide of the roof to let in their light; though in their Cities of <HI>Hola</HI> and <HI>Shalholt,</HI> in&s;tead of Tiles, they make u&s;e of fir-boards.

<P>The food of the <HI>I&s;elanders</HI> is upon Beef, Mutton, and the like, with mo&s;t &s;orts of Foul, which they have in great abundance, the truth is, they have no variety of Sau|ces, but the &s;harpne&s;s of the air furni&s;heth them with &s;tomachs which need none. Fi&s;h they have great plenty of, and which dried, is indeed their only bread, and their Ling is &s;o excellent, that even with us it is counted one of our greate&s;t Dainties.</P>
<P>Their mo&s;t common Drink is Whey, which is generally &s;o good, that an ounce of it will very well bear half an Ounce of
<PB N="143" REF="75">Water. They have al&s;o a &s;ort of Mead, made of Barley flower, and a Honey-comb boyled in Water, and another liquor &s;quee|zed out of a certain reddi&s;h Berry, pecu|liar to this I&s;le. But though they have neither Ale, Bear, nor Wine, they can make a &s;hift to be &s;umptuous, nay, profu&s;e in their Revels and Banquets, for we read that <HI>Theodore,</HI> and <HI>Thorwald</HI> (Brethren and Citizens of <HI>Hialtedat</HI> in <HI>North I&s;eland</HI>) &s;o|lemnizing the Funerals of their Father <HI>Hialta,</HI> entertained twelve hundred Per|&s;ons for fourteen days together at a Ban|quer; and at the departure of his Gue&s;ts made 'em all pre&s;ents, every one &s;uitable to his quality; many more in&s;tances have they of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>They have little mony in <HI>I&s;eland,</HI> what they have is <HI>Dani&s;h,</HI> but that in very &s;mall quantity; bartering one Commodity for another, being their method of buying and &s;elling, as it was of all other Nations in the Non-age of Commerce.</P>
<P>The principal Commodities of this Coun|try are Whalebone, which they have in &s;uch abundance, that many of 'em make Hou&s;es of it, and the only Bridge in the I&s;land is framed of the &s;ame matter, they al&s;o formerly exported va&s;t quantities of Beef, Mutton, Butter and the like, and do

Whereby a man runs great danger in approaching the flames who is not perfectly acquainted with eve|ry part of the mountain, for he not only runs the ri&s;que of being knocked on the head with &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;tones which fre|quently comes to pa&s;s, but al&s;o the ground does &s;urprizingly open, and the flames &s;wallow up men alive. Of this and two
<PB N="145" REF="76">other Mountains in this I&s;land called <HI>Helga</HI> and <HI>la Croix,</HI> more &s;trange circum&s;tances are related, than what are &s;aid of <HI>Aetna,</HI> many of the &s;illy &s;uper&s;titious Inhabitants believing that underneath it is Hell, and the abode of the damned, &amp; &s;ome do confidently report that they have frequently &s;een whole Herds of Devils throng into the mouth of the furnace with their Burthens of damn'd Souls, and having eas'd their &s;houlders, re|turn for a new leading.
