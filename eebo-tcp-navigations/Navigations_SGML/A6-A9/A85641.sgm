<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe King of <HI>Scots</HI> hath re&s;umed the way of me|diation for peace and union between his Roy|all Maje&s;ty, and the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> propo|&s;ing (as an Expedient) that Cardinal <HI>Maza|rin</HI> might be &s;ent away as a Commi&s;&s;ioner to treat about the general peace of <HI>Europe;</HI> but the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> &s;eemed to wave it at pre&s;ent, until &s;uch time, that
<PB N="2" REF="3">by the advice and coun&s;el of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> he was moved to accord thereunto; in pur&s;uance whereof his roy|all Highne&s;s gave his a&s;&s;ent, That young <HI>Charles</HI> &s;hould be permitted to per&s;ue his mediation. Whereupon He imme|diatly &s;ent the Lord <HI>Montague</HI> with a Me&s;&s;age to K. <HI>Lewis,</HI> wherein he declared him&s;elf as followeth:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="body of declaration">
<OPENER>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty,</OPENER>
<P>WHereas by &s;ad experience (in the&s;e our late di&s;tem|pered and unhappy Times) We are &s;en&s;ible of the great Mi&s;eries and Calamities that are incident both to Prince and People, upon the di&s;tempers ari&s;ing between the Head and Members, occurring chiefly from the flames of tho&s;e, who are frighted with mortal apprehen&s;ions, and re|tain unto them&s;elves diver&s;ity of fears and jealou&s;ies, at the remembrance of tho&s;e dangers, which wi&s;e Coun&s;els, and great Favourites, may &s;uddenly involve them in: There|fore, having &s;eriou&s;ly weighed the &s;ad effects thereof, and the great deva&s;tation that doth befall both Crown &amp; King|doms thereby, which with grief of heart I &s;peak it, I hum|bly offer to your Maje&s;ty this Expedient, for preventing of the&s;e inevitable Ruines, That your Maje&s;ty will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider upon &s;ome convenient way for the expelling of the Cardinal (though it were but a limitation of time pre|fixed within your Royal Brea&s;t) and to &s;atisfie the de&s;ires of the people; without which, little &s;afety can be expected, and all hopes of Reconcilement utterly fru&s;trated and taken away.</P>
<P>The King having received this Me&s;&s;age, or Declaration, returned thanks to his Cou&s;in <HI>Charles;</HI> but withall de&s;ired him not to intermeddle any further therein giving a&s;&s;urance that he was re&s;olved to keep and protect the Cardinal.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Citizens of <HI>Paris</HI> were exceedingly ex|a&s;perated
<PB N="3" REF="3">in &s;pirit, offering to rai&s;e 20000 men for the Pr. of <HI>Conde</HI> again&s;t the King: but its probable, that upon re|ceit of the unwelcome tydings of the great blow given to the Princes forces by Gen. <HI>Turein,</HI> and valiant <HI>James Stuart,</HI> they may change their re&s;olutions: for, indeed, the Defeat was great, being managed by a &s;urpri&s;al; the exact Rela|tion whereof, take as followeth:</P>
<P>The King drawing near <HI>Paris,</HI> Mar&s;hal <HI>Turein,</HI> Generall <HI>Hocquincourt,</HI> and Col. <HI>Stuart</HI> being to attend the march of the Court with their Armies, came along the Rivers of <HI>Yonne</HI> and <HI>Seine:</HI> And <HI>Turein</HI> perceiving that if he got be|twixt the Princes Army and <HI>Paris,</HI> he might be able to in|terrupt their communication with the Pari&s;ians, marched with &s;uch care and expedition, that he arrived at <HI>Chartres,</HI> while the &s;ame time the Princes army removed from <HI>Mon|targis</HI> to <HI>E&s;tampes:</HI> And being re&s;olved to &s;et upon the ene|my, he marched all night, and found them daawing up their army near <HI>E&s;tampes;</HI> who &s;pying the Kings army, immedi|atly retired into the Town, placing their Foot within the Works and Fortifications; but cau&s;ed their Hor&s;e to pa&s;s the River.</P>
<P>Hereupon the two Generals drew up near the Walls of the Town; and perceiving a good &s;pace of ground not wel guarded betwixt the outmo&s;t Suburbs and the Town, where they might cut off that part of the Suburbs, they attempted that place, and began the a&s;&s;ault with much re&s;olution, and the Town was well maintained by the Defendants; but the Kings Ordnance having the advantage of a commanding Hillock, did &s;o annoy the Princes party in the Town, and made a breach in the Wall, &s;o that the Kings forces entred; and after a &s;harp di&s;pute, became Ma&s;ters of the Town, &s;ei|zing upon the Magazine, and putting divers to the &s;word: during this di&s;pute, the titular Duke of <HI>York,</HI> brake in with the hor&s;e, doing great execution.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>The Princes party were almo&s;t all killed, or taken, and his own Regiment totally cut off; for they denyed quarter. The Hor&s;e &s;tood all upon a Hill, on the other &s;ide of the River, as Spectators of this bloudy Tragedy, and never attempted to relieve the Foot. The occa&s;ion of the Princes Army draw|ing out thus, was to welcome Madamoi&s;elle from <HI>Orleans,</HI> whence &s;he came to &s;ee them. This action was the more ob&s;ervable, in that the Kings party con&s;i&s;ted onely of 2000 Foot, and 500 Hor&s;e, again&s;t 6000 of the Princes; notwith|&s;tanding they had the advantages of a deep Trench, a &s;trong Wall, and the Town it &s;elf. The Duke of <HI>York</HI> (for &s;o he is called here) commanded the Kings hor&s;e, who charged &s;o pui&s;&s;antly, that his very fir&s;t On&s;et &s;ufficiently te&s;tified he fought either to Death or Victory; for after the fir&s;t Vol|ley, he brake in upon <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and the Princes own Re|giment, doing great execution, and making the field re&s;ound with &s;hrill ecchoes: In this fight was &s;lain Moun&s;ieur <HI>de Bloin,</HI> a Gentleman of irre&s;i&s;table courage: Yet notwith|&s;tanding, the lo&s;s whereof, could not damp the general re|joycing for &s;o important a Victory: Which was pur&s;ued with &s;uch eagerne&s;s of &s;pirit by the afore&s;aid Duke, that the Kings party were in half an hours time exceedingly tran|&s;ported with exce&s;s of gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>The King hearing of this Victory, &s;ent an Expre&s;s to young <HI>James,</HI> to ha&s;ten to the Court, where he was triumphantly entertained, and is now in great e&s;teem among&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> Immediatly after his reception, he pre&s;ented the King with a Narrative of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, and a particular Li&s;t of the Officers and Souldiers killed and taken on both &s;ides: a Copy whereof I have hereunto annexed.</P>
