<P>_IT Holds not alwaies that the be&s;t and mo&s;t virtu|ous Princes finde faithfull and obedient Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cts; but rather on the contrary, clemency and goodne&s;&s;e are requited with &s;trange unthankfulne&s;&s;e, or mon|&s;trous Rebellions. The pre&s;ent and &s;ad experience of His Maje&s;ty the King of England, who was borne to the mo&s;t unque&s;tioned Right of three Imperiall Crownes, &s;ees them all in a raging fit of a di&s;tempered Rebellion, his Queene forced to flee away for refuge and protection: The Prince (the Heire apparent to the Crowne) with other the Royall Branches en|during a ba&s;e impri&s;onment, or a forced ab&s;ence, and Maje&s;ty it &s;elfe confinde by the bloody O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dnances of cruell and barbarous Tray|tors, who fir&s;t pretending a Reformation, and at la&s;t bla&s;pheming more freely to a Saint-&s;hip, have violated all the Rules of duty to God and man, &s;quaring all things acording to the humor of their fancy, and thereby tumbling the world into another Chaos, and new confu&s;ion. The King (for many yeares pa&s;t) hath endeavoured to correct the&s;e bold pre&s;umptions, by meeting impudent Rebellion in the field; but the torrent &s;welling too high, His Maje&s;ty was o|ver borne, and what he could not compleate by a Martiall power, he &s;uffers for (though an unworthy impri&s;onment) by an Angelicall patience, in who&s;e &s;ad afflictions all Loyall Subjects and good Chri|&s;tians beare a part and &s;hare: and now providence hath given &s;ome advantage to an Illu&s;trious and hopefull Prince to enter on the &s;cene, and act a part in this bloody Tragedy, who after two yeares conti|nuance in France, with his Royall Mother the Queene, at length takes his leave, making his fir&s;t j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">urney to Calais, and after a few dayes continuance there prepares him&s;elfe for a pa&s;&s;age into Holland, which &s;ucceeded with a pro&s;perous Gale; and being aboard, a States man of war on Munday the 13. of July <HI>(&s;tilo veceri)</HI> His High|ne&s;&s;e arived at Helver&s;luce, the next day following in the afternoon; but before he put his foot in &s;hooe he had the happy view of a Noble part of the Royall Navy, where the Duke of York, attended
<PB N="2" REF="2"> with many Loyall hearts, had their expectations filled with over|flowing joyes: Their &s;howting and acclamations were exceeding high for &s;uch an acce&s;&s;e of happine&s;&s;e; and the Seamen, and Can|nons plaid their parts, and with their loud voices roared out their joyfull apprehentions, filling the Region of the Ayre and tryum|phing over the waters, with high expre&s;&s;ions of chearfullnes; that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Prince of wales was now with them. And now the tide of rejoi|cing pa&s;t over, His Higne&s;&s;e goes on &s;hore; and having &s;uddenly met with the Duke of Yorke; the two Princes congratulated their happy meeting, and with love un&s;peakable embraced each other: The day following the Prince of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ange made an early vi&s;it to the Prince of Wales, and the matchle&s;&s;e Prince&s;&s;e, the Prince&s;&s;e Roy|all made all ha&s;t to wait on her Brother, thinking every minute too tedious untill &s;he enjoyed His pre&s;ence: The Queene of Bohemia and her family made all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to welcome this Princely Gue&s;t; and after a few dayes or rather howers &s;pent in &s;alutation, the Prince directs His thoughts for a voyage by Sea, and minding the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the Navy, bids farewell to His Royall friends: And on Thur&s;day after His Highne&s;&s;e arived at Helve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;l uce: He went aboard the Admirall, where after &s;ome &s;econd expre&s;&s;ions of chearfulne&s;&s;e, he was received with great Te&s;timonies of duty and obedience; and the winds not blowing faire for the Downes, the command was given to beare Northward towards Yarmouth Rode: And upon Saturday following about a in the afternoone, the whole Fleet atten|tending His Highne&s;&s;e ca&s;t Anchor in that Rode, where after an hower or two it was re&s;olved, that a Gentleman &s;hould be &s;ent with a Letter of kindene&s;&s;e, and with certaine heads of the Princes De|claration the better to invite and animate that Corporation to their obedience: But &s;ome of the enimies Troopers guarding the Shore, forced the Me&s;&s;enger to returne to the Navy <HI>(Re infecta,)</HI> &s;o by rhat interuption the Princes good intentions to the Towne, and the Town&s;men good affections to the Prince were not under&s;tood at that time: The next day being Sunday, the Navy floting on the Sea, and the people amazed in the Towne, both continued in great admiration of each other; the Fleet wondred at the peoples &s;trange undutifulne&s;&s;e towards their Prince, and the People &s;car'd into a timerous, and benummed neutrality &s;tared towards the Fleete with various di&s;tracted affections: The di&s;tempers and di&s;compo|&s;ures in the Towne were very furious for a fit: at la&s;t their feare exceeded their love and Honour to their Prince, and forgetting
<PB N="3" REF="2"> what an opportunity they had to welcome their Prince &s;o grea a &s;tranger: that night was &s;pent in frozen cold expre&s;&s;ions, and the night approaching &s;ummoned re&s;t and &s;ilence for that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the Morning &s;ome petty expre&s;&s;ions of du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y dared to appeare, and His Highne&s;&s;e had a ta&s;te of &s;ome loyall Adventures, which by boat came to the Admirall from per&s;ons well affected and deeply tou|ched with the &s;ence of &s;o great per&s;ons neerne&s;&s;e to the Towne. And after a while betwixt 6 and 7 of the clock on munday morning (the Town&s;men having &s;ummoned their wits together the day before) it was re&s;olved in a publique meeting: That one of the Aldermen of the Towne &s;hould come and vi&s;it the Prince, and accordingly (a &s;mall Boat being &s;et off from the &s;hore) a trim Town&s;man neatly dre&s;t up in a great double Ruffe, and in his &s;atten doublet, &s;peedily came to the Admirall, where having performed his devoir to the Prince, he out with his pur&s;e and impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ently told His Highne&s;&s;e, that the Towne was re&s;olved to admit no forces of either &s;ide: But if His Highne&s;&s;e plea&s;ed to command any refre&s;hments from the Towne, His plea&s;ure &s;hould be obeyed. His Highne&s;&s;e then con&s;i|dering the &s;taggering humor of the People, or rather more &s;eriou&s;ly the ca&s;uall condition of the Towne &s;o nearly waited on by a malici|ous enemy, accepted the motion of refre&s;hments; and having Or|dred commands for that purpo&s;e, the word was given for the whole Fleet to waigh Anchor, and the winde being courteous, to hoy&s;e up &s;ayles and to &s;teere towards the Downes: which motion being ob&s;er|ved by the Towne&s;men, they were free with their Canon at our fare|well, and they di&s;charged their O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">dnance round the Towne, which was interpreted a te&s;timony of their cheerefulnes, and loyalty, rather then of their feare or neglect. On the Wedne&s;day following, the Na|vy came with a fayre quarter wind into the Downes: at who&s;e fir&s;t approach the two fair Ca&s;tles of Deale and Sandowne di&s;charged their Ordnance for joy, and the &s;everalll &s;hips were mutuall and kind in their expre&s;&s;ions: and now the whole fleet having ca&s;t anchor in the Downes, fre&s;h occa&s;ions were given for better advantages: Some de&s;ignes were propo&s;ed for enriching and encrea&s;ing of the Navy, that the Seamen might prove the more couragious, and the Fleet more formidable to all oppo&s;ition. But &s;ome more heady and impatient motions &s;tarted &s;uddenly on foot: And &s;ome of the Offi|cers and Seamen grew fierce and violent for the Land &s;ervice, and the reliefe of the two be&s;ieged Ca&s;tles of Deale and Sandowne; and the &s;udden rai&s;ing of the whole County of Kent, was a fancy that
<PB N="4" REF="3"> vainly hurryed away the mindes of &s;ome, who&s;e precipitate violence hath &s;ince recompenced their ha&s;ty indi&s;cretion: &s;ome le&s;&s;e experi|enced courages thought to remove mountaines as well as ride over waves, and made no doubt of heating Hor&s;e and Foot from before the Ca&s;tle with their mu&s;quets and pikes: But the mixt body of Souldiers and Seamen (under the conduct of Sir <HI>John Boys</HI> and Major Generall <HI>Gib&s;on</HI>) being about the number of 600. in the whole, and all Foot, were after a gallant adventure, mightily overpowred by a numerous Body of Hor&s;e and Foot of the enemy; &s;o that the retreat was for|ced to Sandowne Ca&s;tle, and &s;ome few &s;laine (to about the Number of fifteene) and ninety three being taken pri&s;oners, according to a li&s;t of their names, &s;ent from the enemy by a trumpet the nex mor|ning: The re&s;t of the Souldiers retired to Sandowne Ca&s;tle for pre|&s;ent &s;helter. And the skirmi&s;h over, they were the &s;ame day before night reimbarked into the &s;everall &s;hips of the Navy: But though an importunate violence (not to be &s;atisfied) occa&s;ioned &s;ome mis|fortunes on &s;hoare, the windes and tydes brought better &s;ucce&s;&s;e at Sea: And in a &s;hort time the Navy began to &s;well with new additi|ons of &s;trength and wealth. Each &s;hip was diligent in their duty to attend the North and South furlongs. And the Convertine and Blackmore Lady not a little pro&s;perous; all the Fleet carefully ob|&s;erving that no &s;hip might pa&s;&s;e without acknowledgment and duty to the Admirall now in the Downes the Kings chamber. And a guard being commanded for obedience, the Fleet did &s;udainely thrive to greater power: But amid&s;t the occurrences at Sea, the Prince con&s;iders the Affaires at Land: And in order to his Royal Fathers bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, thinkes meete to di&s;patch a Gentleman to the tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter, with a letter of kindne&s;&s;e to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and a Declaration inclo&s;ed; thereby manife&s;ting to all the world his Princely inclinations and de&s;ires to the peace and happine&s;&s;e of the Kingdome; but the Gentleman was in a few dayes returned, brin|ging no an&s;wer to his Highne&s;&s;e that contained nothing in it but craft and wonted &s;tubburne&s;&s;e, plainely di&s;covering that the men of We&s;tmin&s;ter were re&s;olved rather to &s;acrifice the hopes of all mens happine&s;&s;e to their ambition, lu&s;t, and avarice, then part with the lea&s;t mite of their u&s;urped power; and this occca&s;ioned an utter differ|ment of all future motions to that purpo&s;e; but whil&s;t tho&s;e on &s;hore are &s;o bruti&s;h and mon&s;trous, the Sea gave good advantages of a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, And fir&s;t the Cormant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ne a new &s;hip (laden for Ginnye in the We&s;t Indyes, and now named the <HI>Charles</HI> by the Prince him&s;elfe)
<PB N="5" REF="3"> was reduced from that imployment to &s;erve his Highne&s;&s;e, and proves a bold and gallant Frygot. The <HI>Love,</HI> another tall and gallant &s;hip (returning from the Streits out of the Venetian &s;ercice, formerly im|ployed again&s;t the Turks) was received (pa&s;&s;ing through the Downs) into &s;ervice, and made a man of war to attend the Navy; &s;ome other &s;hips of great importance and &s;ervice were there admitted, and li|&s;ted for attendance and commands, which proved cheerefull additi|ons of &s;trength and power. And now after &s;ome weekes &s;pent at Anchor in the Downes; notice and alarum was given of the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Preparations, and comming for Sea: After which ad|verti&s;ement, his Highne&s;&s;e advi&s;ing with his Coun&s;ell of war, thought fit to weigh Anchor, and &s;aile from the Downes towards Lee-Rode, being the mouth of the Riuer Thames to dare and encounter all op|po&s;ition which &s;puriou&s;ly pre&s;umed to affront Royalty, and to make triall whether the Earle of Warwicke dur&s;t &s;ayle with the Royall Standard and Flag in his Main Top. The Seamen were extreamly for|ward in the de&s;ign; and (though &s;ome coun&s;els were clean a ver&s;e) yet after the Prince under&s;tood that Warwick was certainly drawn downe from Grave&s;end, his courage countermaunded all coun&s;els.</P>
<P>And in publick Aboard the Admirall His Highne&s;&s;e cheerefully de|clared his Re&s;olutions for Lee-Rode, which di&s;covery of his for|wardne&s;&s;e &s;o animated the hearty Sea-men, that they pre&s;ently &s;ee|med as eager and violent as hungry Lyons to &s;earch out and pur&s;ue the pray; that dared to appeare under &s;uch a brazen faced rebellious countenance: And from the&s;e motions, the flames of Re&s;olution grew &s;peedily more fervent over all the Navy; and all things are prepared and po&s;tured for a fight at Sea, if the enemy dur&s;t grapple or engage. To this purpo&s;e a new Command was given on Sunday the &s;eaven and twenty of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the &s;everall &s;hips to weigh Anchor, and &s;ayle towards the Rebellious Party; who&s;e more nimble and &s;couting Frygots were fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t di&s;cerned on the Tue&s;day following, which &s;ight &s;o encouraged the hearts of all the Fleet attending the Prince; that the Officers and Sea-men brake forth into new expre&s;|&s;ions of joy, not doubting but to reduce the Rebels to &s;ubmi&s;&s;e o|bedience, or el&s;e re&s;olving to dye in a Cau&s;e &s;o ju&s;t and honourable. And this re&s;olution was confirmed by an Oath of fidelity (which the Officers and Sea-men voluntarily tooke in his Highne&s;&s;e Pre&s;ence, going aboard each &s;hip) to be true and faithfull to his Highne&s;&s;e Per|&s;on and Commands again&s;t the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> power, and all his Adherents and Confederates. And after the&s;e great pledges of fide|lity
<PB N="6" REF="4"> was given on Wedne&s;day morning; the Fleet made all the &s;ayle they could, &amp; pur&s;ued the Frygots (fir&s;t di&s;covered the night before) which &s;uddainly returning to their Mock-Admirall, told the newes of the Princes Approach with his Fleet, which made them (being then under &s;aile) to tack about: And they ba&s;ely fled, and &s;uffered the pur&s;uite for ten Leagues at lea&s;t, the Channell growing more narrow, the Sands numerous on each &s;ide, and the night approaching, the en|gagements, were &s;omewhat the longer deferrd; for the next morning (after the mi&s;ty fog was fir&s;t di&s;per&s;ed) the Princes whole Navy weighed Anchor againe, re&s;olved to fight with the enemy, whether lying at Anchor or under Saile; all preparations were ha&s;tened in the &s;everall &s;hips, the Cabins in an in&s;tant knockt downe, and &s;lung into the Sea, the guns primed and leveled, the granads and fire balls ready, and &s;everall gunners with their lin&s;tocks ordered in their &s;everall quarters: And all per&s;ons diligent to obey commands, re&s;olved to beate and conquer the enemy, or dye bravely. And yet before the endeavour of farther attempt; it plea&s;ed the Gracious Prince to try if a Me&s;&s;age of peace and pardon could mollifie obdurate Traytours, and divers or prevent the effu&s;ion of Engli&s;h blood; Anciently Acts of grace did ingage the people, <HI>ob&s;equio mitigantur imperia:</HI> And kinde M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ges very prevalent with civ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Heathens. To this purpo&s;e the Prince was plea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d to &s;end a groome of his Bed-chamber to <HI>War|wick,</HI> with a Letter to prepare his Loyalty and obedience; but his Committee-M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ters &s;o ordered their Cypher-Admirall, that a ba&s;e and unworthy an&s;wer was returned, much to this purpo&s;e: That his Warwick&s;hip was (for&s;ooth) Lord High Admirall by a Commi&s;&s;ion from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he two Hou&s;es at we&s;tmin&s;ter; and that he could not &s;trike the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gge in his mainetop to any Per&s;on whom&s;oever; which Re|bellious defyance made all Loyal Re&s;olutions much more keene, and ha&s;tened the Princes Fleet to more &s;peedy revenge; which was on Thur&s;day attempted with many de&s;perate haz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ds to engage the ene|my; but his Mock-Admiral&s;hip avoides all offers of fighting: And flying as neere the &s;hoare as po&s;&s;ible, would not endure the breath of a Canon, nor the &s;ight of a broad &s;ide. Among&s;t other exchanges of the day: The Prince in the Admirall was very forward, and cal|ling for his Armes, ready to engage, minded more the pre&s;ervation of his Honour then his Per&s;on; notwith&s;tanding all importunities of his Coun&s;ell, and the Sea-men &s;o earne&s;t for his &s;afety: He an&s;we|red that he dreaded no hazard in &s;uch a Cau&s;e, but per&s;i&s;ted re&s;olute and undaunted to encounter with the greate&s;t danger, equally with
<PB N="7" REF="4"> the meane&s;t Per&s;on ingaged, and following the <HI>George,</HI> wherein <HI>War|wick</HI> was, made often at him: But <HI>Warwick</HI> &s;till looked either to the mouth of Chattam River for the Protection of Queenburrough Ca|&s;tle, or towards the mouth of the River of Thames, that he might be &s;ecure of the block hou&s;es neere Graves end. Another hand&s;ome piece of Gallantry, the Vice-Admirall of the Princes Fleet did ma|nife&s;t by pur&s;uing <HI>Warwicks</HI> Mock-Vice-Admirall &s;o long, and to &s;uch a neerene&s;&s;e, that if &s;he dur&s;t have &s;tayd, or &s;hewed any courage, the engagement mu&s;t &s;udainely proved very bloody, or very glorious to one of the two: The Swallow the Reare-Admirall in the Princes Fleet, was very impatient of Attendance, and in order made a &s;wift pur&s;uite after <HI>Warwicks</HI> &s;hip; but he dur&s;t not &s;tay to give or take a broad &s;ide from any of the Princes &s;hips; but &s;till crept neerer the &s;hoare towards Queenburrough Ca&s;tle: And thus the great &s;hips and frygots having plyed too and againe to ingage the enemy to fight, a violent &s;torme of winds and tempe&s;t &s;udainly ari&s;ing, di&s;cre&s;|&s;ion forced the Princes whole Fleet to ca&s;t Anchor againe; and darkene&s;&s;e parted further di&s;putes for that night following: The n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">xt day being F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">yday, the winds blew faire to goe to Sea, and they &s;eemed to breath an invitation to either Fleet, where they might have Sea roome to fight and end the quarrell: And betwix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ix and &s;eaven of the clock, the command was given in the Princes Fleet to weigh Anchor, and hoi&s;e up &s;ailes, where the Channell being na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ow, the Sands numerous, and the way dangerous, by rea&s;on of a Pa&s;&s;age called the Spits (where many Sea-wracks yet appeare) the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> et &s;ai|led very gently le&s;t they &s;hould be too &s;oone ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Warwicks</HI> &s;ight, and the motion was ordered the more &s;low to dare <HI>Warwicks</HI> compa|ny to a more proper conveniency of fighting: And for &s;ome nine or ten Leagues <HI>Warwicke</HI> &s;eemed to be inclined to that purpo&s;e, and three Frigots of his mocke Vice-Admirall, came neere &s;ometimes, and once within di&s;tance of Canon &s;hot: and two &s;mall Ships of the Princes fleet loytering in the Reare, were lagging like ea&s;ie &s;weet baits to in|vite <HI>Warwicks</HI> Frigots to make greater ha&s;te: which (the Rear Admi|rall the Swallow being pa&s;t by) they &s;eemed to gape more greedily hoping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;eaze on the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, though they dur&s;t not be enga|ged by any that were their equalls: But the Princes Reare-Admirall well knowing her duty &s;uddenly tackt about and turned the Helme a lee, and her Sales halled up, &s;he pre&s;ently gave deafince to <HI>War|wicks</HI> three Frygots, and the mock-Vice Admirall: nay that Tacking about checked <HI>Warwicks</HI> whole Fleet, which pre&s;ently halled up
