<HEAD>A True and Perfect RELATION OF THE ENGAGEMENT That happened between His Maje&s;ties Ship the KING's-FISHER, <HI>Cap, Francis Wheeler. Com^r^.</HI> AND THE GOLDEN ROSE OF ARGIERS, The <HI>4th.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> 1681. Fitted from thence by the People of <HI>SALLY,</HI> Mounted with 22. Guns, and 22. Petereroes; wherein the Particulars of the Engagement, and taking of the &s;aid Ship, as it was Communicated in a Letter, dated the <HI>6th.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, from <HI>Malaga</HI> Road, to the Secre|tary of the Admiralty, are as followeth.</HEAD>
<P>AFter I had <HI>Carreen'd</HI> and fitted my Ship at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> in Pur&s;uance of <HI>Admiral Herbert</HI>'s Orders, la&s;t <HI>Friday</HI> the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> We went into the <HI>Gut</HI> to Crui&s;e, between <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and <HI>Sutta,</HI> on <HI>Tue&s;|day</HI> the <HI>4th.</HI> in&s;tant, being <HI>N. E.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> from <HI>Gibraltar</HI> 10. Leagues off, &s;tanding to the <HI>S.</HI> ward, the Wind <HI>We&s;terly;</HI> We happened to &s;tand &s;tem for &s;tem with the <HI>Golden Ro&s;e,</HI> fitted out of <HI>Argiers,</HI> (but it &s;eems at the Charge of &s;ome People at <HI>Sally,</HI>) Mounted with 22. Guns, and 20. Petere|roes; As &s;oon as we made what they were, we gave chace upon a Wind, to the <HI>N.</HI> ward, and in le&s;s then one hour got into her Wake, and within Mu&s;quet Shot, at which time unluckily our Fore-top-ma&s;t came by the Board, which brought down the Main-top-gallant-ma&s;t; when he out-reached us, but &s;eeing a Ship under the <HI>Spani&s;h Shoar,</HI> he put a&s;tays, but the Ship refu&s;ing it, he put a way afore the Wind. When we had cleared our &s;elves of our Fore-top-&s;ail, and got our Main-top-gallant-&s;ail on our Fore-top-ma&s;t-Stump, we had him &s;o well under our Lee, that he could not clap by with|out
<PB N="2" REF="2">out hazard of being run down by us; We bore away, and Out-Sail'd him, and with one of our Cha&s;e-Guns, Shot down his Fore-ma&s;t, and pre&s;ently got Aboard fair along his &s;ide; but for want of his Rigging, my Bow-&s;prit could not get any hold, and being before the Wind, though our Cour&s;es were hawled up, and the Main-top-fail lowred down to the Slings, yet we could not keep a Stern, and mi&s;t entring my Men; We got Aboard twice after very well forward, but by the &s;ame rea&s;on could not keep fa&s;t; The fourth time we got up our Grapples on our Star-board-&s;ide, and intended to be fa&s;t on his Lar-board bow, but ju&s;t as we were coming upon his Quarter, he skilfully put his Helm hard a Star-board, and had like to have been Thwart our Haw&s;er, which we prevented by quick working, and got very well on his other &s;ide; But his Sails being all Torn, We could not come to make fa&s;t a Haw&s;er to his Main-&s;hrouds, but upon his falling off, We brought our Star-board-&s;ide, to bear and cut down his Main, and Mizon Ma&s;ts; Upon which he yielded.</P>
<P>Upon my Lieutenants going on Board, they found five Foot Water in hold, occa&s;ioned by &s;even Shot under Water, of which two were double-head, all Unplugged, the Pumps-Shot in peices, and before they could get the Boat out of the way to Bayl, the Water was within two Foot of the Gun-Deck: When the Water began to come in at the Ports, &s;everal of the Port-Lids being Shot away, and there being a great Sea, for want of Ma&s;ts, She rowled &s;o extreamly, as contributed much to her lo&s;s, though they got Her afore the Wind with all the dilligence po&s;&s;ible; we got Her in a Towe, and by that time we had Her along our Quarter to &s;ave the Men; She went down Head formo&s;t, with abundance of Wounded Moors who were in the great Cabbin, Steerage between Deck, and in hold, with two of my own Men who &s;taid too long below to Plunder. The main rea&s;on of Her lo&s;s was occa|&s;ioned by the Moors, who being &s;o terribly frighted, did not &s;top the &s;hot-holes; and although our People did it as well as the &s;hortne&s;s of the time would permit, yet 'twas then too late, and 'tis not unlikely but that they mi&s;t find|ing of &s;ome.</P>
<P>Of our Men there were two Kill'd, three Wounded, and two Drowned. The &s;mallne&s;s of the lo&s;s makes it rea&s;onable to judge they did not fight very well; but this I am certain, that 'twas great courage in them to be &s;o &s;tub|born as not to yeild, but to venture to take our Broad-&s;ide four times, &s;o near as our low Guns touched his Ship-&s;ide, Loaded with Round and Double-&s;hot, with thirty Musqueteers playing upon them, be&s;ides abundance of Shot &s;ent them before, I really judge never beyond Pi&s;tol-&s;hot.</P>
<P>'Twas near this place She yielded, &s;o that it is not out of my way to come in to get up a new Top-Ma&s;t, Fi&s;h our Fore-Yard, which is dangerou&s;ly Wound|ed, and knot and fit our Rigging, and mend our Sails; as al&s;o in our way fill &s;ome Cask with Water, which will all be performed by to morrow night, and then to Crui&s;e with our clean Ship, who we find Sails well large, and pretty well by. This Ship had when &s;he came out of <HI>Argiers</HI> near 150 Men, whereof eight Chri&s;tians and three Renegadoes, of which not above one half are to be found, and all of them we &s;aved by Swimming, and our Boat; 28 are wounded, and a good part of them very dangerous; We began to fire our Chace-Guns near eight a Clock, Boarded Her the fir&s;t time near ten, and Shee yielded at two, and Sunk at three a Clock, or pa&s;t.</P>
