<P>_THere came an account of the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of our fir&s;t En|gaging with the Dutch Fleet to this effect.</P>
<P>Upon Friday 18. in&s;tant as &s;oon as day began to dawn, ours di&s;covered the Holland fleet, betweene <HI>Portland</HI> and the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> about &s;even leagues off <HI>Portland</HI> North and by We&s;t, the wind North-we&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ted of about 80 &s;aile men of war be&s;ides the Merchant men, which were judged about 150 &s;ome &s;ay many more, they all having the wind of us.</P>
<P>But about eight a clocke the &s;ame morning Gen. <HI>Blake</HI> and Gen. <HI>Dean</HI> being both of them aboard the <HI>Triumph,</HI> ingaged the Enemy, the Dutch men of war bearing upon them, but the re&s;t of our Fleet indeavouring to follow, not above three or four of them could get up, becau&s;e they were to Lee-ward, &s;o that the Generall with tho&s;e few were con&s;trained to bear the fir&s;t brunt holding play with no le&s;&s;e then 30 of the Dutch men of war, whereof &s;even at a time kept upon the <HI>Tryumph,</HI> and yet they con|tinued till two a clock in the afternoon, being much &s;hattered in her Sales, but &s;o tite in her Hulls, that &s;he never &s;o much as pumpt for it.</P>
<P>It was ten a clock before any more of our fleet ingaged, and then not above halfe our number came up, the whole amoun|ting to about 60 faile: after this the di&s;pute grew very hot, and &s;o continued for the &s;pace of 4 or 5 houres, but afterwards the
<PB N="2" REF="3">fight grew more moderate, holding play till night parted both parties.</P>
<P>In this action the Lord was plea&s;ed &s;o to pro&s;per us, that wee lo&s;t but one &s;hip called the <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> which was rendred un&s;er|viceable in the Fight, and then her men being taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> was &s;unk by her own Captaine, having fir&s;t &s;unk the Enemy which maimed her, &s;he was a Ship of 26 guns, her Captaine is wounded, his name is Captaine <HI>Button:</HI> We had like to have lo&s;t the <HI>Pro&s;perous</HI> commanded by Cap. <HI>Barker,</HI> but &s;he was re|taken by Cap. <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ey</HI> commander of the <HI>Merly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Frigot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Advice</HI> F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">got was in hot &s;ervice having 4 &s;aile of <HI>Dutch</HI> which lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">board of her, yet &s;he acquitted her &s;elf &s;o wel, that &s;he &s;unk one of their Rear Admiralls of 38 guns down by her &s;ide, and one &s;hip more of 36 guns in the &s;ame manner, but her Cap. is dangerou&s;ly wounded, his name is Capt. <HI>John Day,</HI> there are wounded al&s;o his Ma&s;ter and divers other Officers; his Lieut, Boat&s;waine and Corporall with about 35 more are &s;lain and a|bout 40 or 50 more wounded: The Dutch boarded her once, and had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her fore ca&s;tle, but they were beaten out again, her Hull, Ma&s;ts and Rigging are &s;o &s;hattered, and her Company &s;o much di&s;abled by &s;o &s;harp and di&s;advantagious a confl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ct, having coped with &s;o many at once, that &s;he was occa|&s;ioned that night to make for <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> there to repaire.</P>
<P>The lo&s;&s;e on our &s;ide is of divers worthy, and precious men, in the Generals own &s;hip the <HI>Triumph</HI> which was &s;o &s;harply in|gaged, there are between 80 and 100 killed and wounded wher|of 4 of note, <HI>viz.</HI> Cap. <HI>Bal,</HI> the Gen. Secretary Mr. <HI>Sparrow</HI> with the Ma&s;ter who&s;e name is <HI>Broadrtdge</HI> and his Mate. The two Generals was by an over-ruling providence pre&s;erved, other|wi&s;e greatly indangered, by a bar of Iron which wounded Ge|neral <HI>Blake</HI> on the left thigh, a litle above the knee, but not dan|gerou&s;ly, and tore two peeces of the coate and Brechees of Gen. <HI>Deane;</HI> all with the &s;ame &s;hot.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>In the <HI>Van-guard</HI> there was &s;laine Cap. <HI>Mildmay</HI> with about 30 more killed and wounded In the <HI>Fortune</HI> Cap. <HI>Tatnel.</HI> In the <HI>Pro&s;|perous</HI> Cap. <HI>Barker,</HI> Cap. <HI>Kirby,</HI> and Cap. <HI>Deacons</HI> are wounded.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Dutch</HI> lo&s;&s;e, the exact &amp; ful particular is not yet known but thus much is certaine, we have taken one of their Vice Ad|miralls a &s;hip of 1200 Tuns and 44 peece of Ordnance 6 or 8 bra&s;&s;e, it being one of their prime &s;hips, This ve&s;&s;ell was found to have 100 men &s;taine in her being delivered up to Cap. <HI>Stokes,</HI> be|ing much battered by the <HI>Lyon</HI> who would have bit hard before if &s;he had had this Cap. in her, who is &s;aid to have been the bain of 3. of the Dutch men of War, the <HI>Dragon</HI> al&s;o plaid her part ve|ry lu&s;tily. There was &s;unk and burnt of the Dutch fleet in this incounter, one of their Vice Admirals, one of the Rear Admirals, and nine more of their men of War. Seven or eight more &s;o maimed, that &s;ome of them were &s;een towed, what more may be is not yet known, but our men were plying towards the Enemy, five leagues off the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>And on Saturday 19. in&s;tant our fleet began with 2. Frigots to re-ingage them about 10. a clock in the morning, but left againe for a while, till the main fleet came up, and then about one a clock the whole fleets were ingaged, ours having that day the wind, the Dutch being before, and &s;etting their Merchant men Ea&s;t-ward of <HI>Dunno&s;e</HI> 6. leagues all along the Channell.</P>
<P>The 18. at night there came to the fleet the <HI>Diamond</HI> from <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> 2. Merchant men from the Downes, with the <HI>Saphyre</HI> Cap. <HI>Hill</HI> who informed that in all there were 19 more coming from the Downs, the <HI>A&s;si&s;tance, the Advice</HI> and <HI>the Oake</HI> are come into <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and &s;ome private men of War gone our thence.</P>
<P><HI>From the</HI> I&s;le of Wight 19. <HI>in&s;tant, Al&s;o it is written that the &s;ame day being Saturday the two Fleets were ingaged againe, within foure leagues of the I&s;land plainly in veiw, that they begun about</HI> 12 <HI>of the clocke, and &s;pent &s;ome time upon firing at each other at a di&s;tance, but afterwards the Fight growing hot, the Sea being calme, and Sea roome
<PB REF="4">enough, it was conceived &s;omewhat in all probability would be done to purpo&s;e, that ours pre&s;&s;ed much after the enemy before they could engage; that they have placed their Merchant men in the Van, who are ob&s;er|ved to ha&s;ten Ea&s;tward, that our &s;hips were &s;een to come gallantly ex|cept</HI> 10 <HI>or</HI> 12 <HI>which could not &s;ail &s;o fast, but were likely to get in quickly, and that ours had the weather-gage of the enemy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By another of the &s;ame date from the &s;ame I&s;land, it is written far|ther thus, That on Frydays engagement about</HI> 8 <HI>or</HI> 9 <HI>of the Dutch Ve&s;|&s;els were ob&s;erved to be burnt: That on Saturday both Fleets in view of that I&s;land were engaged again: that there were about</HI> 4 <HI>leagues off in the trade-way: That &s;ome of our headmo&s;t &s;hips began the engage|ment about</HI> 12 <HI>of the clock that day, which the Dutch endeavoured to avoid: That the Dutch Fleet were of Men of War and of Merchant|men (as was gue&s;&s;ed) near</HI> 300: <HI>That ours &s;eemed about</HI> 70. <HI>of which &s;ome were not fully come up: That the Dutch placed their Merchant|men in the Van, who appeared, endeavouring to &s;ail on Ea&s;tward as far as they could, yet but &s;lowly, the wind being very &s;till: That their Men of War engaged retreating, and ours pre&s;&s;ed on hard, being as fa&s;t as they could get up: That ours had gotten the weathergage, and the fight waxed very hot, even while this Letter was a penning, and the &s;ea&s;on and peace of the fight being con&s;idered, the event is like to be very con|&s;iderable.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe&s;e &s;erve only to advi&s;e you of what we have heard concerning the action between our Fleet and the Hollan|ders, who fir&s;t engaged on Friday la&s;t about half Seas over of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> which continued all day, and was a very hot di&s;pute: but what the event of it was there is not any certainty yet come; only the general report of &s;ome that are arrived from thence, who can give no particulars, but &s;ay we have had the be&s;t of it, and conceive 5 of their Men of War that day to be taken.</P>
<P>This day came on &s;hore one <HI>Thomas Prynne</HI> &s;ent in with a prize; who was one of the company of the Nightingale Frigot, who were la&s;t Saturday in the fight of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> who &s;aith they ingaged with the whole Fleet of the Hollanders about noon, and fought them the whole day, where one of the Hollan|ders greate&s;t Ships were taken, night coming on they parted.</P>
<P>On Sunday morning our Fleet had &s;ight again of the Hollan|ders, and about nine of the clock engaged again with their whole Fleet, which for an hours time was very de&s;perate; but at leng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">h the enemy bore up before the wind, with all the &s;ail they could make, our Fleet cha&s;ing them &s;o that they made a running fight;
<PB N="6" REF="5">who making &s;uch great &s;ail, left their Merchant men a &s;tern off them, who began to &s;traggle in a confu&s;ed manner, &s;ome falling in among&s;t the thicke&s;t of our Fleet, which in regard of the pur|&s;uit of the Hollanders, were forced to &s;ink &s;ome, and fire the re&s;t. By all that we can gather, our Fleet is yet in cha&s;e of them both to the Ea&s;tward and the Southward: the wind at pre&s;ent blows hard at North, and North-ea&s;t, &s;o that tho&s;e &s;hips of the Hol|landers that have e&s;caped are not able to get home. There is in our road afar off the Fairfax, whereof Captain <HI>Law&s;on</HI> was Com|mander, who is &s;lain, who hath taken the Vice-Admiral of Holland prize; with him many other &s;hips are &s;een in the <HI>Offing</HI> conceived to be prize: by all that we have &s;ound together, it is generally concluded a total di&s;per&s;ing of the Hollanders Fleet, who were between four and five hundred &s;ail of Men of War and Merchant-men.</P>
<P>We hear not of the lo&s;s of any of our &s;hips, only the &s;hip Pro&s;perous was boarded and taken by the Hollanders, but was immediately again retaken by one of our Frigots.</P>
<P>There is already brought into the Road three prizes, but we have no great accompt of them. One is loaden with Wine from <HI>Nantz,</HI> and the others with Salt and Brandwine. We have not el&s;e,</P>
