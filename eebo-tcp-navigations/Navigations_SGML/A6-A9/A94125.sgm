<HEAD>A Rea&s;on of this <HI>Work.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHereas there are thou&s;ands of &s;hips belonging to this Kingdom, which have not Mini&s;ters with them to guide them in Prayer, and therefore either u&s;e the old Form of Common-Prayer, or no Prayer at all; The former whereof for many weighty Rea&s;ons hath been aboli&s;h|ed, and the latter is likely to make them ra|ther Heathens then Chri&s;tians (the Lords day being left without any mark of Piety or Devotion) Therefore, to avoid the&s;e Inconveniences, It hath been thought fit to frame &s;ome Prayers, agreeing with the Directory e&s;tabli&s;hed by Parliament; It being hoped, that it will be no grief of heart
<PB N="4" REF="3">to wi&s;e and full Chri&s;tians, if the thir&s;ty drink out of Ci&s;terns, when them&s;elves drink out of Fountains; But they will ra|ther pity the wants of their needy Bre|thren, and out of Compa&s;&s;ion immitate him who filleth the hungry with good things.</P>
<P>The&s;e Prayers being enlivened and &s;ent up by the Spirit in him that prayeth, may be lively Prayers and acceptable to him who is a Spirit, and accepts of &s;ervice in Spirit and Truth. And, in truth, though Prayers come never &s;o new, even from the Spirit, in one that is a guide in Prayer, if the Spirit do not quicken and enliven that Prayer in the Hearer that follows him, it is to him but a dead Form, and a very carca&s;e of Prayer.</P>

And we pray thee, for his &s;ake, to turn away thy heavie wrath and cur&s;e from us, which we are not able to avoid or bear; and humbly and earne&s;tly be&s;eech thee, out of thy free Grace and Mercy, to grant unto us the full Remi&s;&s;ion of all our

Lord, we be|&s;eech thee, let it be now to thy &s;ervants according to this thy Word, and then let that al&s;o be done which ju&s;tly followeth: Let us Prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;&s;e, and his wonderfull workes to the &s;ons of men; Let us Exalt thee in the Congregation of the People, and Prai&s;e thee in the A&s;&s;embly of the Elders: And if the Heathen Mar|riners which carryed <HI>Jonah,</HI> being delivered from the &s;torm, did fear the Lord exceedingly, and offered Sacri|fice to the Lord, and made Vows; Let us much more who have the light of the Go&s;pel in &s;o great a mea&s;ure be|yond them, fear thee greatly, and offer to thee the Sacri|fices of Prai&s;e, and make Vows of better Obedience:
<PB N="16" REF="9">And, Lord, having made &s;uch Vows, a&s;&s;i&s;t us by thy grace that we may perform them; and cau&s;e us all our lives to carry with us, and in us, the &s;ame thoughts and re&s;oluti|ons of holine&s;&s;e and good Conver&s;ation, which we have when we are in a &s;torm, and not obey thee wor&s;e after de|liverances, then we re&s;olved to do in dangers. And, Lord, how &s;oever thou &s;halt plea&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of us, we do here ca&s;t our &s;elves down under thy Mighty hand; We &s;ub|mit our &s;elves to thee, as the clay to the Potter, to do with us what is good in thy fight; for thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed that all &s;hall turn to good to tho&s;e whom thou ha&s;t cho&s;en: And ha&s;t further &s;hewed us, that neither life nor death can &s;eparate us from thy love that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; Let it be &s;o unto thy &s;ervants, let thy love alwayes be towards us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Son of thy Love: What&s;oever Iudgements fall on our bodies, let our &s;ouls be &s;aved by the Lord Je&s;us; Let us &s;o be knit unto him by a lively Faith, that we may be partakers of him, and in him, of life Eternall: And having a &s;ure hope and confidence here|of, let us de&s;ire to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with Chri&s;t, which is be&s;t of all; and at our di&s;&s;olution, &s;peak with a&s;&s;urance to be heard, Lord Ie&s;us Receive our Spirits: Hear us, O Lord, and grant us our Petitions, and what&s;o|ever thy wi&s;dom knows to be be&s;t for us, which is far be|yond all that we can ask or think, and all for the &s;ake of thy Son and our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, through whom alone we and our Prayers have acce&s;&s;e unto thee; to whom with thy G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">orious &s;elf, and mo&s;t Holy Spirit, be all Honour and Glory, Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, Service and Obe|dience, from this time forth, and for evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
