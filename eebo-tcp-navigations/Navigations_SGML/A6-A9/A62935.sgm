<HEAD>A NEW ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>Northern-America.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>TR&V;TH and Sincerity being the chief Qualities, which make a Book of this nature Valuable, the Author of this promi&s;es him|&s;elf upon that account a favourable Recep|tion from the Publick: and therefore thinks it would be &s;uperfluous to make a longer Preface.</HI></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cavelier de La Salle,</HI> a Native of <HI>Roan</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> the chief Under|taker of the Di&s;coveries in the <HI>Northern America,</HI> which make the Subject-Mat|ter of this Book, was a Man of extra|ordinary Parts, and undaunted Cou|rage. He was the fir&s;t that formed the De&s;ign of Travelling from the Lake of <HI>Frontenac</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> to the Gulph of
<PB N="2" REF="3"><HI>Mexico,</HI> through a va&s;t unknown Coun|try, in order to bring the Inhabitants to the Knowledge of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, and Extend the Dominions of the King of <HI>France.</HI> This Gentleman having duly weighed all the Difficulties that were like to cro&s;s &s;o Noble a De|&s;ign, came to Court to acquaint his Maje&s;ty with it, who was plea&s;ed not only to approve his Enterprize, but al|&s;o to Encourage it, by the Liberal A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and the Power he gave to M. <HI>La Salle,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e of his New Di&s;|coveries as he &s;hould think fit.</P>
<P>I was then at the Court of <HI>France</HI> to &s;ollicit &s;ome Employment, having &s;erved his Maje&s;ty both by Sea and Land, and lo&s;t one Hand in <HI>Sicily</HI> by a Granado, and as M. <HI>La Salle</HI> was upon his departure, the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was plea&s;ed to recommend me to him, as fit to accompany him in his Undertaking, whereupon I was ea&s;ily admitted, the Patronage of His Highne&s;s having been very u&s;eful to M. <HI>La Salle.</HI> Every thing being ready for our departure, we &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Rochel, July</HI> 14. 1678. to the number of 30 Men, among&s;t whom were Pilots, Carpenters, Smiths and other u&s;eful Arti&s;ts, and arrived at
<PB N="3" REF="3"><HI>Quebec</HI> upon the 15th of <HI>September</HI> follow|ing; we remained there &s;ome days, after which having taken our Leave of Count <HI>Frontenac</HI> Governor-General of <HI>Canada,</HI> we &s;ailed up the River St. <HI>Laurence</HI> to Fort <HI>Frontenac,</HI> where we landed.</P>
<P>That Fort lyes within 120 Leagues from <HI>Quebec,</HI> about the 44th Degree of Latitude, on the Mouth of a Lake cal|led likewi&s;e <HI>Frontenac</HI> or <HI>Ontario,</HI> which is near 300 Leagues about, and has a communication with four other Lakes, much of the &s;ame extent. All tho&s;e Lakes are Navigable, and plentifully &s;tored with Fi&s;h; The Mouth, or en|trance of this Lake is defended by a Fort with four large Ba&s;tions, which might protect a great number of Ve&s;&s;els again&s;t the attempts of any Enemy. As M. <HI>La Salle</HI> had Erected this Fort, the King had given him the Propriety thereof, and of all the Lakes there|abouts with their dependencies. The Country about it is &s;o Charming, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe its Beauties: The va&s;t Meadows are intermixed with Woods and Fore&s;ts, full of all &s;orts of Fruit-Trees, and watered with fine Brooks and Rivers.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>It was in this place that we prepared our &s;elves for our great Voyage, and Glorious Undertaking, of which no bo|dy, I am &s;ure, can give a better ac|count than my &s;elf, not only becau&s;e I accompanied the &s;aid M. <HI>La Salle,</HI> but al&s;o becau&s;e the chief Care and Burthen of that Perilous, tho' Glorious Enter|prize, fell upon me by the untimely Death of that Gentleman. The Ac|count which I offer now to the Publick, is extracted out of the Journal I kept, wherein I &s;et down things as they ap|peared to me: 'Tis true, I am &s;ome|times obliged to take things upon Tru&s;t, becau&s;e I could not be always with M. <HI>La Salle,</HI> but I am &s;o fully convin|ced of the Probity and Hone&s;ty of tho&s;e upon who&s;e Evidence I have advanced any thing, that I may an&s;wer as well for their Ob&s;ervations as for my own. The Reader mu&s;t not therefore expect here Noble and Pompous De&s;criptions, &s;uch as Authors u&s;e to adorn their Works with, but a natural &s;implicity, and a rigid fidelity. If my Stile &s;eems har&s;h and unpolite, I have no other Apology for it, but that I may have contracted &s;ome thing from the Com|merce
<PB N="5" REF="4">of the Savages of <HI>America,</HI> with whom I have &s;o long conver&s;ed.</P>
<P>Who&s;oever con&s;iders this Enterprize in it &s;elf, the difficulties it was attend|ed with, and the advantages that <HI>Eu|rope</HI> may reap from the di&s;covery of tho&s;e va&s;t Countries, which are above eighteen hundred Leagues North and South, will I hope agree, that an ex|act account thereof is worthy of the Cu|rio&s;ity of the Reader.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ferti|lity of the Soil.</NOTE>That large Country is now called by the name of <HI>Loui&s;iana,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof in the Name of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great. The Soil is, generally &s;peaking, &s;o fertile, that it produces Naturally without any Culture, tho&s;e Fruits that Nature and Art together have much ado to bring forth in <HI>Europe:</HI> They have two Crops every Year without any great fatigue; the Vines bring extraordinary Grapes, without the Care of the Husbandmen; and the Fruit-Trees need no Gardiners to look after them; the Air is every where temperate; the Country is watered with Navigable Rivers, and delicious Brooks and Rivulets, and diver&s;ified with Fore&s;ts and Meadows; it is &s;tockt with all &s;orts of Bea&s;ts, as Bulls, <HI>Orig|nac</HI>'s,
<PB N="6" REF="5">Wolves, Lines, Wild A&s;&s;es, Stags, Goats, Sheep, Foxes, Hares, Beavers, Otters, Dogs, and all &s;orts of Fowls, which afford a plentiful Game for the Inhabitants. They have di&s;covered Mines of Lead and Iron, and 'tis not doubted but there are al&s;o Mines of Gold and Silver, if they would give them&s;elves the trouble to look for them, but the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Countries valuing things only as far as they are nece&s;&s;ary for Life, are yet unacquaint|ed with the Fanciful Value we put upon tho&s;e Metals, and have not dig'd up the Earth to look for them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Man|ners of the Inhabi|tants,</NOTE>Tho&s;e Inhabitants have nothing of Man but the Shape and the Name; they live without any Laws, Religion, Superiority, or Subordination, Indepen|dency and Liberty being their <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> or the ultimate end they pro|po&s;e to them&s;elves. Their Life is al|ways wandering, having no &s;etled Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions; they take &s;everal Wives, if they plea&s;e, whom they quit when they will, and leave them to others, ju&s;t as they do their Habitations, for after having for &s;ome time cultivated a piece of Ground, they quit it without any occa&s;ion to Cultivate another, and the
<PB N="7" REF="5">fir&s;t comer takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, &s;o that they are perpetually changing their Habitations, and by this continual motion, every thing becomes in a manner common among&s;t them: they know no Superiority, and think the World is made only for them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Reli|gion.</NOTE>I &s;aid they have no Religion, tho' it &s;eems they have an ob&s;cure Idea of God, becau&s;e they live as if they thought there was none. They believe in ge|neral that there is a God, but who does not concern him&s;elf in what they do. Some Wor&s;hip the Sun, and others fan|cy that the World is full of certain Spi|rits, who pre&s;ide over their Actions, and they are &s;o extravagant as to be|lieve, that every thing in the World has a Spirit, and that they are Good or Hurtful according to the <HI>Caprice</HI> of that Spirit. 'Tis upon this Principle that are grounded all the fooli&s;h Super|&s;titions of their <HI>Jugglers</HI> or <HI>Monitous,</HI> who are their Prie&s;ts or Magicians.</P>
<P>I don't believe that they have car|ried their Reflections &s;o far, as to think on the Nature of their Souls; tho' 'tis true, they &s;eem to believe their Immor|tality, and a kind of <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is,</HI> or Tran&s;migration of Souls; but they have
<PB N="8" REF="6">&s;o many extravagant fancies upon this Subject, that it is in a manner im|po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover their true Opinion. I may &s;ay in general, that they are &s;o &s;tupid in matters of Religion, that they are not convinced of their own Belief, nor of what others believe, and there|fore Laugh at the In&s;tructions of our Mi&s;&s;ionaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Good quali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ies.</NOTE>However, notwith&s;tanding that bru|ti&s;h temper, they have as good a Sen&s;e as the re&s;t of Mankind, to know their true Intere&s;ts, and therefore are capable of Negotiations, Commerce, and Coun|&s;el. They know how to weigh and con&s;ider the Con&s;equences of an Enter|prize, and take Ju&s;t Mea&s;ures to com|pa&s;s it. When they meet together to con&s;ult about &s;ome great De&s;ign, they &s;it in a private place, in a profound Si|lence, &s;moking Tobacco, and every one &s;peaks gravely in his turn. It is to be ob&s;erved by the by, that they never make any Treaty, Convention or Agree|ment with any body, till they have fir&s;t of all, mutually exchanged Pre|&s;ents. They give commonly Collars as the Symbol of Union; they have a par|ticular Kettle for Peace, and another for War. They proclaim Peace with
<PB N="9" REF="6">the <HI>Calumet,</HI> and War by great Out|cries, or rather dreadful Howlings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sci|ence in War.</NOTE>They know likewi&s;e how to Incamp, and Fortifie their Camps with Intrench|ments and Palli&s;adoes. They ob&s;erve al&s;o &s;ome Order in their Attacks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Til|lage.</NOTE>This Soil produces indifferently all &s;orts of Corn and Plants, but as they have ob&s;erved, that &s;ome among them are more proper for their Nouri&s;hment than others, they take care to Sow and Cultivate them, and therefore they have great Crops of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, of which they make a &s;ort of very delicious and nouri&s;hing Pap. They Cultivate al&s;o what they call <HI>Touquo,</HI> of which they make their <HI>Ca&s;&s;ave,</HI> and Turneps, where|with they make <HI>Ca&s;&s;amite.</HI> The&s;e are their own terms, which are not to be tran&s;lated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Phy|&s;ick.</NOTE> There are in their Country &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, from which an excellent Bal&s;am drops, the u&s;e where|of the Savages know very well, as al&s;o of &s;everal Plants again&s;t Wounds, and the venomous bitings or &s;tinging of Ser|pents and other Creatures.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their A&s;tro|nomy.</NOTE>Their Knowledge is not circum&s;cri|bed within tho&s;e narrow bounds, they carry it as far as Heaven, and have ob|tained a &s;ufficient Knowledge of the
<PB N="10" REF="7">Cour&s;e of the Sun, Moon and Planets, and pretend thereby to foretel the changes of the Weather, Winds, Storms, and other things of this nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Dex|terity.</NOTE>Be&s;ides tho&s;e qualities already men|tioned, they have a wonderful dexteri|ty at &s;everal beautiful and u&s;eful Works: Some of them make extraordinary fine Mats for their Coverings, and adorn|ing their Cabins; others have found the way to Dre&s;s Leather to make Wa&s;tecoats and Shoes; but their great|e&s;t dexterity appears, in my opinion, in the &s;tructure of their <HI>Canoos</HI> which can never &s;ink. They make them with the Barks of Elm, Walnut-trees or Elder|trees, about 10 or 12 Foot long, the &s;ide being a little turned inward as <HI>Gondolas.</HI> In&s;tead of Oars they make u&s;e of two pieces of Wood, like two Bakers Peals, and term <HI>Swimming</HI> what we call <HI>Row|ing.</HI> As their Canoos draw very little Water, becau&s;e of their lightne&s;s, the Savages <HI>Swim</HI> with an extraordinary &s;wiftne&s;s, even again&s;t the &s;tream of Rivers, and undertake very long Voy|ages without fearing Rocks or Storms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tra|vels by Land.</NOTE>Tho' there are neither Road nor Path in that Country, they Travel through the&s;e va&s;t Fore&s;ts and Wilderne&s;&s;es,
<PB N="11" REF="7">with the help of certain Marks they make upon the Rind of Trees from place to place; and by the&s;e means, the Wo|men and Children are able to find the Men when they go a Hunting, or upon any Expedition. They very &s;eldome bring home what they kill, and it is the Office of their Wives to fetch it and dre&s;s it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ca|bins.</NOTE>I think fit to add, in this Place, a &s;hort Account of their Cabins, Hou&s;|hold-Goods, and the like. Many of them are wandring in Woods, where they lie upon the Ground as Bea&s;ts; but &s;uch who live together, make Cabins, or Huts, with Branches of Trees driven into the ground, interlaced with others, and joined at the top as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;i|ble, and covered with Reeds, or large Leaves of Trees. The in&s;ide looks &s;ome|what better, it is well-enough Matted, and mo&s;t of them have a &s;ort of curious Floor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Beds.</NOTE>Their Bed&s;teads are made up with &s;ome pieces of wood, upon which they lay skins full of Wool or Straw; but for their Covering, they u&s;e the fine&s;t &s;ort of Skins, or el&s;e Mats finely wrought.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Kit|chin &V;ten|&s;ils.</NOTE>They have Cellars, or rather Holes, to pre&s;erve their Corn, their Wood, and other Provi&s;ions; but all their Kitchin Uten&s;ils con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome few pieces of Earthen-Ware, which they make with Clay, and harden it with the Dung of Bulls. They have no &s;orts of Mills, but in&s;tead thereof, u&s;e to grind their Corn between two Stones, with a great deal of trouble. They make u&s;e of a &s;ort of &s;harp Stones in&s;tead of Knives; but this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of &s;uch Sa|vages, who never had any Commerce with <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms.</NOTE>They u&s;e Bows and Arrows with great dexterity, and the extremity of their Arrow is arm'd, in&s;tead of Iron, with a &s;harp Stone, or the Tooth of &s;ome Animal. They have be&s;ides heavy Clubs, or &s;harp Sticks, in&s;tead of Swords or Halberds. They u&s;e al&s;o wooden Cor&s;lets again&s;t Arrows, and make Bucklers with &s;everal skins &s;titch|ed together.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ap|parel.</NOTE>Mo&s;t of them go &s;tark Naked, and are &s;o inured to Rain, and other Hard|&s;hips, that their bodies are almo&s;t in&s;en|&s;ible; and the &s;oles of their Feet &s;o hard, as to re&s;i&s;t the &s;harpne&s;s of Thorns and Stones. Their Women
<PB N="13" REF="8">have &s;till pre&s;erved a &s;hadow of Mode|&s;ty, for they wear commonly about their wa&s;te a large Girdle, from which hang two pieces of skin, which cover in &s;ome manner their Nakedne&s;s. I &s;peak of tho&s;e Savages who Inhabit a Temperate Climate, for tho&s;e who live to the Northward of <HI>Quebec,</HI> and other cold Countries, cover them&s;elves with skins of Bears, Stags, Ellends, and the like. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve al&s;o, that tho&s;e who Inhabit toward <HI>Mexico,</HI> &s;eem more civillized than others; for tho' their Climate is pretty Hot, they cover them|&s;elves with Mats finely wrought.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The care of the Family divided be|tween the Husband &amp; the Wife.</NOTE>The care of the Family lies equally upon the Husband and the Wife: The former goes a Fi&s;hing or Hunting for the Family; and the Wife Tills the ground, and gets in what &s;he has &s;ow'd. It is likewi&s;e her Duty to fetch Fruit, Herbs, and other things in the Woods. When the Savage is come back from Hunting, he takes fir&s;t of all his Pipe, and as he &s;moaks, tells his Wife what he has done, and what he would have her to do, which &s;he mu&s;t obey without any reluctancy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Sa|vages.</NOTE>One may ob&s;erve in Men a great Gravity and Authority, and in Women
<PB N="14" REF="9">an extraordinary Complai&s;ance for their Husbands, and as they follow their Natural In&s;tinct in every thing they do, their Behaviour is always &s;incere and without any affectation; and one may truly &s;ay, That the conjugal Union be|tween them, is the effect of a Natural Inclination, which is common to Men and to Brutes, and not founded upon a true Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Wo|men in par|ticular.</NOTE>The Savages being perpetually in Action, they are free from &s;everal Di&s;|ea&s;es that the <HI>Europeans</HI> are &s;ubject to, and 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the&s;e Women have not that natural Incommodity that ours are liable unto, and that, which is &s;till more to be wonder'd at, they bring forth without any Pain, or at lea&s;t without any ceremony as they go along, making no other Provi&s;ion for it, than their own girdle, and &s;ome Skins to wrap up the Child into.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Breed|ing of their Children.</NOTE>They have a very extraordinary way to bring up their Children, for though they have no Clouts or Swath-Bands, they have found a way to keep them very clean without any great Trouble. They provide them&s;elves with a good quantity of Du&s;t of rotten Wood, which is as &s;oft as any Doun what&s;oever, and is
<PB N="15" REF="9">very good to pre&s;erve them again&s;t Hu|midity. They lay their Children upon that Du&s;t, and wrap them into &s;ome good Furs, and tie them pretty fa&s;t, and have nothing to do for dre&s;&s;ing them, but to change that Du&s;t, by means whereof they keep them always clean, till they are able to walk about.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they feed them.</NOTE>They Feed them with Pap, made with <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and give them a Bow as &s;oon as they can walk; &s;o that they u&s;e them&s;elves to &s;hoot, and follow their Parents into the Woods, learning thereby betimes the u&s;ual Places for Hunting; and having no manner of E|ducation, they are only guided by their Natural Inclination and Sen&s;uality, as Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>I &s;hould never make an End, &s;hould I undertake to give a particular Account of all the Cu&s;toms of the Savages; but I think that what I have &s;aid is &s;ufficient to convince the Reader, that their In|telligence extends only to what is Ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting their Natural Life; and that if they have any Law among&s;t them, it is to ob&s;erve none at all. Born and bred up in Forre&s;ts, Hunt|ing is their greate&s;t Pa&s;time, to which I may add War, Quarrels, and Cruelty,
<PB N="16" REF="10">which is &s;uch, that they mu&s;t turn their Arms again&s;t harmle&s;s Bea&s;ts, when they want Pretences or Opportunities, to u&s;e them again&s;t Men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>La Salle</HI> un|dertakes with <HI>30</HI> Men to Travel through tho&s;e Na|tions.</NOTE>It was through tho&s;e Wild Nations that Mr. <HI>La Salle</HI> undertook to Travel, and di&s;cover a Way to the Gulph of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and who&s;oever will impartially con&s;ider that Enterpri&s;e, mu&s;t agree, that this courageous De&s;ign can hardly be parallell'd. But this will appear the better, if they con&s;ider what Preparations he made for that great Journey. He had only <HI>Thirty</HI> Men, as I have already &s;aid, without any other Provi&s;ions, but Powder and Shot, which were to &s;upply him during his Voyage. We had fir&s;t of all a Bark, and &s;ome Canoos, but we were &s;oon deprived of that help, and forc'd to Travel by Land, and carry our Equipage, cro&s;&s;ing large Rivers upon Rafts, or Trees, having no other Guide through tho&s;e va&s;t unknown Countries but a Compa&s;s, and the Genius of our Commander, who (according to the variation of the Needle, and the Knowledge he had in A&s;tronomy) was able to gue&s;s at the Climate we were in, and what cour&s;e we were to follow.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="10">
<P>The&s;e Difficulties, the Armies of Sa|vages, which we were obliged to Fight to force our way, Hunger, Thir&s;t, and other Wants and Perils, were however &s;urmounted by our Courage and Con|&s;tancy, &s;o that we arriv'd at the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and after &s;everal Misfortunes returned Home. But before I proceed any further, I think fit to give an Ac|count of the <HI>Four Lakes</HI> I have already mentioned.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The upper Lake, or &s;uperior Lake.</NOTE>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> lies above the 47 Degree of Latitude, and is called <HI>&V;pper Lake,</HI> or of <HI>Frontenac,</HI> and may be 80 Leagues broad, and 300 in circuit. It has com|munication with the Lake <HI>Herie,</HI> or of <HI>Conti,</HI> by a Canal of above 20 Leagues long, interrupted by a Fall of 600 Foot high, known under the Name of <HI>Fall of Niagara.</HI> This Lake of <HI>Conti</HI> joins with another called <HI>The Lake of the Hurons,</HI> or of <HI>Orleans,</HI> by a Canal or &s;tream which is very Rapid, and this la&s;t Lake has communication to the <HI>South</HI> with a <HI>Fourth,</HI> called, <HI>The Lake of the I&s;linois,</HI> or of the <HI>Dauphin:</HI> It joins al&s;o by the <HI>North-&s;ide</HI> with another Lake, larger than any of the re&s;t, called, <HI>The Lake of Conde;</HI> but we did not &s;ee it.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="11">

<P>M. <HI>la Salle</HI> being arrived in that Bay, took &s;ome new mea&s;ures, and &s;ent back his Bark, laden with Furs, to <HI>Niagara,</HI> and embarked again in Canoos with &s;e|venteen Men and a <HI>Recollect,</HI> to go to

<P>However, as he ob&s;erved that this Nation was incon&s;tant, and ea&s;ily im|po&s;ed upon, he thought fit to build a Fort for his Security, and to make there a kind of Magazine for the execution of his further De&s;igns, which was accord|ingly done with all convenient &s;peed, M. <HI>la Salle</HI> having cho&s;en an advantagi|ous Situation at the Mouth of the Ri|ver.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="15">
<P>The impatience I had to re-join M. <HI>la Salle</HI> with the fifteen Men I had brought back to their Duty, obliged me to make all the ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible, but the want of Provi&s;ions, and the contrary Winds obliged us to land within Thirty Leagues of our Fort, where we found Acorns and &s;ome Staggs, wherewith we refre&s;hed our &s;elves. My Men were &s;o hara&s;&s;ed, that I could never per&s;wade them to imbark again the &s;ame day, which obliged me to imbark alone with our Pilots, promi&s;ing them to return &s;peedily. The Weather being very &s;tormy, we &s;pent &s;ix days before we could reach the Fort <HI>Miamis,</HI> where I gave an Account to M. <HI>la Salle</HI> of my Di&s;coveries.

<P>The&s;e la&s;t words &s;eem'd to me a Com|mand, and therefore after having re|fre&s;hed my &s;elf, I went again into my Canoo, but I was hardly Fifteen Leagues off, that I was met by a vio|lent Storm, in which our Canoo was overturned and then &s;et to rights again, and at la&s;t driven upon the &s;hore, from whence we went over Land to meet
<PB N="27" REF="15">our Men at the place appointed. We arrived there the next Morning, and having &s;pent the re&s;t of the Day to get them together, embarked again, and came in le&s;s than one day to Fort <HI>Miamis.</HI></P>
<P>M. <HI>la Salle</HI> was very glad to &s;ee his Men together, looking upon this Re|cruit as a nece&s;&s;ary Supply to carry on his De&s;igns, and yet the&s;e very Men di&s;appointed them, and &s;ome time after put an end to his Di&s;coveries, and to his Life, &s;o that the Men alone, upon whom he grounded his hopes, were the only cau&s;e of all the Misfortunes that befell him, and of the Tragical end of his Life.</P>
<P>M. <HI>la Salle</HI> having in le&s;s than two Months put his Fort in a good po&s;ture of Defence, as well to protect his Barks, and Canoos, as to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the Natives on the Land &s;ide, and in|gaged the chief of the Nation into his Intere&s;ts, re&s;olved to advance as far as the <HI>Illinois,</HI> who&s;e neare&s;t Habitation was above 100 Leagues from our Fort.</P>

They love Women with ex|ce&s;s, and Boys above Women, &s;o that they become by that horrid Vice, very effeminate. 'Tis ob&s;ervable however, that notwith&s;tanding that vitious Incli|nation, they have &s;everal Laws to pu|ni&s;h that infamous Vice. For as &s;oon as a Boy has pro&s;tituted him&s;elf, he is degraded in a manner of his Sex, being forbidden to wear the Apparel or Name of Man, and to make any Office or Function fit for Men, even nor &s;o much as to be &s;uffered to go a Hunting. They are therefore look'd upon as Women, and confin'd to their Employments, of whom they are even more &s;lighted and hated than by Men; in&s;omuch that the&s;e Wretches become, by their Crime, the &s;corn and contempt of both Sexes. Thus without any help but natural Rea|&s;on, they are &s;en&s;ible of their Crime, and have made the&s;e Laws as a Bridle to ma&s;ter their bruti&s;h &s;en&s;uality, tho',

They are very Jealous, and puni&s;h the Infide|lity of their Wives with a great &s;everi|ty. <HI>Hermaphrodite</HI> are very common among&s;t them, but whether it be an ef|fect of the Climate or no, I do not pre|tend to determine. Women, and the pro&s;tituted Boys I have &s;poken of, work fine Mats for hanging their Cottages, while Men go a Hunting or till the Ground for &s;owing of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn.

<P>M. <HI>La Salle</HI> being &s;en&s;ible of the &s;trength of this Nation, thought that nothing was to be neglected to keep them in amity with us; but at the &s;ame time that it was nece&s;&s;ary to provide our &s;elves again&s;t their Incon&s;tancy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fort built.</NOTE> There|fore he ordered a Fort to be built upon a ri&s;ing ground near the River, which was in a little time in a po&s;ture of defence.

I was pre|paring my &s;elf to &s;uffer every thing, but ob&s;erving a young ra&s;h <HI>Iroquois</HI> &s;tand|ing behind me with a Razor in his Hand, and knowing the Cu&s;tom of that Cruel Nation, which is to cut off their Enemies Head, and then take off the Hair and Skin like a Cap, which is a|mong&s;t them the greate&s;t Trophy, I did not doubt hue this young Warrior had a great fancy to my Hair, which he touch'd now and then, and le&s;t he &s;hould do it too &s;oon, I told him, that he ought, at lea&s;t, to expect the Orders of his Ma&s;ters. <HI>Tagancourte</HI> would have me put to death, but <HI>Agou&s;tot</HI> being a particular Friend of M. <HI>La Salle,</HI> oppo|&s;ed the other General, and by a kind of Miracle, Mercy perhaps, for the fir&s;t time, prevail'd with this Barbarous Na|tion;
<PB N="55" REF="29">and it was re&s;olved to &s;end me back to the <HI>Illinois,</HI> and tell them they were di&s;po&s;ed to a &s;incere Peace and U|nion, giving me a fine Collar of <HI>Porce|lain,</HI> as a Token of their &s;incerity. They prote&s;ted that they would for the future, live in Peace with the <HI>Illinois,</HI> and look upon them as Brethren, &s;ince they were Children of the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> which they did not know before.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the danger I had e&s;caped, Cured me almo&s;t of my Wound, and gave me &s;ufficient &s;trength to return to our Camp. I met about half the Way, Father <HI>Gabriel de la Ri|bonde,</HI> and Father <HI>Zenoble Membr&egrave;,</HI> who almo&s;t di&s;paired of &s;eeing me any more, and therefore could hardly expre&s;s the joy they had for my happy return. We went together to the <HI>Illinois,</HI> to whom I deliver'd the Me&s;&s;age of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> but advis'd them withal not to tru&s;t too much to their Words and Pre&s;ents; for I could not per&s;wade my &s;elf, that &s;o Cruel and Ambitious a Nation would return Home without any other Advantage, but that of having made Peace with the <HI>Illinois,</HI> whom they pretended to &s;ubdue; which was ra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters"> a di&s;honour, and therefore I lookt

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re&s;olu|tion of the <HI>Illinois,</HI> upon my return, and their De&s;ertion.</NOTE>The <HI>Illinois</HI> were fully per&s;waded with what I told them, of the Infide|lity of the <HI>Iroquois;</HI> and yet they re|&s;olv'd to return the Pre&s;ent by an Em|ba&s;&s;ie. They called, in the mean time, a Council, to take the nece&s;&s;ary mea|&s;ures for their Defence; but their young Warriors being &s;atisfy'd with the Glo|ry they had gained in the fir&s;t: Attack, wherein they repul&s;ed their Enemies, would not venture a &s;econd Fight, and mo&s;t of them left their Camp. The others being thus weakened by their De&s;ertion, ran away upon the approach of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> who plundered their Camp.</P>
<P>Being thus for&s;aken by our new Con|federates, we retir'd into our Fort, but the <HI>Illinois</HI> being re-inforced by fre&s;h Men, appeared again two days after, upon a ri&s;ing ground in good Order, and re&s;olved to fight; whereupon the <HI>Iroquois</HI> thinking they were more nu|merous than at fir&s;t, and having tryed their Valour in the former Attack, de|fir'd me to interpo&s;e my mediation for a Peace, which I accepted; and they gave me one of their Chiefs as an Ho|&s;tage.
<PB N="57" REF="30">I went to the <HI>Illinois</HI> with Father <HI>Zenoble,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Par|ties accept my media|tion.</NOTE> and told them the Propo&s;als of the <HI>Iroquois;</HI> and that I had brought one of their Chiefs for Ho&s;tage.

This Que&s;tion did not plea&s;e them, and after a general grumbling, they told me, that &s;ince I was &s;o curi|ous, they would &s;atisfie me, and that they would depart, after having de|vour'd &s;ome of our Brethren, or el&s;e &s;ome of the <HI>Illinois.</HI> As &s;oon as I un|derstood this An&s;wer, I thru&s;ted back their Pre&s;ent with my Foot, and told them, that &s;eeing they had &s;uch a De|&s;ign, I would accept none, adding with|al, that I would march away without their.

<PB N="62" REF="33">was among&s;t them one <HI>Abenaguis,</HI> with whom I had been acquainted, who told me, that they were very much angry with me, and advis'd us to retire with all the ha&s;te we could to our Fort; which we did accordingly, and &s;tood all the Night long upon our Guard, being re&s;olved to defend our &s;elves to the utmo&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>When we &s;aw our &s;elves &s;afe, Father <HI>Zenoble</HI> and I made &s;everal Reflections, on the Di&s;&s;imulation and Infidelity of that Nation, and likewi&s;e on the dangers we had been expo&s;ed to in their Coun|cil; and I remember that that good Father blam'd my proceedings; and &s;aid, That in tho&s;e nice occa&s;ions, we ought to be more pliant, in hopes to find a more favourable opportunity. I agreed with him in general, but in&s;i&s;t|ed, that this Principle admitted of &s;ome exceptions, and that a&s;&s;uredne&s;s and vi|gour were more prevailing upon bar|barous men, than a more prudent way. In the mean time we advi&s;ed what was fit to be done in this juncture;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> quit the Fort.</NOTE> and be|ing unable to defend us again&s;t &s;o ma|ny Enemies, we re&s;olved to quit the Fort the next day.

<PB N="63" REF="33"><HI>French</HI> men; the others who were in the Fort, having cho&s;en to go and live among the <HI>Illinois</HI> rather than to return home.</P>
<P>Having equally divided our Arms, Ammunition, and Goods, we Embark|ed the Eleventh of <HI>September</HI> 1687, ve|ry early, and about Five Leagues from the Fort, we went a&s;hore to re|pair our Canoo, and dry &s;ome Furs, which the Water would have &s;poiled. As we were bu&s;ie about it, Father <HI>Gabriel</HI> told me that he would take a walk along the Shore;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Father <HI>Ga|briel</HI> mur|thered by the Sava|ges.</NOTE> and I ad|vi&s;ed him to keep in our &s;ight, be cau&s;e we were &s;urrounded with E|nemies; but the charming Pro&s;pect of that Country ingaged him a little too far, &s;o that &s;eeing he did not return, we began to mi&s;tru&s;t that he was fal|len into the Hands of the Savages. Fa|ther <HI>Zenoble</HI> and I advanced into the Woods to look for him, but could not di&s;cover what was become of him, not|with&s;tanding we fir'd our Arms, and made all the Night long a great Fire to give him notice of the place where we expected him. We under&s;tood &s;ince, that he was met by a Band of Savages called <HI>Quicapous,</HI> who murther|ed
<PB N="64" REF="34">him, and &s;old, &s;ome time after, his Breviary to a Je&s;uit, from whom we learned the&s;e particulars. Thus dyed this Holy Man, in the &s;eventieth Year of his Age, by the Hands of tho&s;e very Men for the &s;ake of whom he had left his Native Country, and &s;uffer'd &s;o many Fatigues.</P>
<P>We waited for him 'till the next day about Noon, but having no hopes of his Return, we Embarked again, and after one Months Navigation, land|ed within two days Journey of the Lake of the <HI>Illinois,</HI> into which we car|ried over Land our Equipage. We em|barked again on the 20th of <HI>October,</HI> and ten days after, were forced to land, by contrary Winds, within 20 Leagues of a great Village, called <HI>Potavalamia,</HI> where we found no other Provi&s;ions but Acorns.</P>
<P>I was &s;ick of an Ague, and my legs were &s;o &s;woln, that we could not reach the Village I have &s;poken of 'till the 10th of <HI>November.</HI> We found no body in it, nor any Provi&s;ions, but having, by good chance, advanced into the Coun|try, we met with a good quantity of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, which enabled us to Im|bark again. The Winds were &s;o cro&s;s,
<PB N="65" REF="34">that we were oblig'd to come a, Shore few days, after, where having found &s;ome fre&s;h foot-&s;teps, we, followed the Track, and came to another Village of the <HI>Pontoualamis,</HI> which was likewi&s;e abandoned, but however afforded us &s;ome Provi&s;ions, which were &s;ufficient to maintain us 'till our arrival at the Buy of <HI>Puans,</HI> which; was towards the latter end of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Having already de&s;cribed this Bay, I need not repeat it now, but I mu&s;t add, that there is a Creek in it called the Creek of the Sturgeons, becau&s;e of the prodigious quantity of that, &s;ort of Fi&s;h that is catch'd in it. We refre&s;h|ed our &s;elves in that place for &s;everal days with the <HI>Pontoualamis,</HI> who en|tertained us with &s;corched Bee&s; and Stagg. We diverted al&s;o our &s;elves in Hunting of Beavers, which afforded us a great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Country about the Bay, being watered by an infinite number of Ri|vulets, lined with great Trees, and the Woods being full of A&s;pen-trees, the Branches and Leaves whereof are the dainty food of Beavers. Tho&s;e Creatures are very numerous in tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="35">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ac|couns of Beavers.</NOTE>The Beavers are, as every body knows, Amphibious, Creatures, who cannot live without Air, Water, and Land. They are near as big as Sheep, but not so tall, their legs being very &s;hort, but &s;o nimble, that they come nothing &s;hort of Apes for dexterity. They have a Muzzle or No&s;e, and &s;trong Teeth; their Body is covered with thick Hair, and pretty fine, but their Tail is made up of a kind of twi&s;ted Hair, Which forms a figure like that of a Triangle, and &s;erves them as a Trowel to beat the &s;oft Earth they make u&s;e of to build their Ha|bitations.</P>
<P>The In&s;tinct or Indu&s;try of tho&s;e Creatures is almo&s;t incredible, and there|fore I am &s;en&s;ible that many will que|&s;tion the Truth of what I have to &s;ay about it, however, I may a&s;&s;ure the Reader that I do not Romance in the lea&s;t. When they have a mind to make a new Settlement or Habitation, and have found a proper place for it, which is commonly in the Channel of a: Ri|ver, provided it be not too deep, or too broad, they look for a Tree on the Bank of the &s;aid River, lean|ing a little towards the Water. They
<PB N="67" REF="35">meet together in a Circle, and becau&s;e their number is always odd, it &s;eems that they hold a Council, to know what is fit to be done. The fir&s;t thing to be done, is to cut down the Tree they have pitched upon, but not hori|zontaly, but in &s;uch a manner that it may fall into the very place they have a mind to, that is cro&s;s the River, to &s;top, or at lead to abate the Rapidity of the &s;tream. If the Branches hinder the body of the Tree to lye in die Water. they cut them likewi&s;e, and then make a perfect Dike or Bank with Mud and Gravel together, leaving now and then &s;ome places open for the Water, le&s;t the River &s;hould overflow their Bank. If the Tree cannot reach the other Shore, they fell another Tree over a|gain&s;t it to join that, and make a per|fect Cau&s;ey or Bridge. This Work being compleated, they build their Ha|bitations or Caves near that place, and employ nothing but mud in the fol|lowing manner; they lay a Lay of it, and beat it very hard with their Tails, and then another, and &s;o on &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly, 'till it is about three Foot high; they Arch it and Poli&s;h it very hand&s;omly, and divide it into three &s;everal Apart|ment&s;,
<PB N="68" REF="36">which have communication one with the other; one of them is to lie in, the &s;econd for their Provi&s;ions, and the third &s;erves them for a nece&s;&s;ary Hou&s;e. They make a Canal or &s;ubterranean Aqueduct from the River to one of their Apartments, in which they have a kind of Pond, wherein they hold their Tail, for otherwi&s;e they could not live. This Canal &s;erves al&s;o for a|nother u&s;e, for when they hear any noi&s;e, they make their e&s;cape through that place into the River. Every one is obliged to work, but if any one has his Tail excoriated or other wi&s;e hurt, he lays it flat upon his back, to &s;hew that he is unable to work.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they Hunt Bea|vers.</NOTE>When the Savages go a Hunting, they follow the Rivers, and as &s;oon as they di&s;cover any Cau&s;ey, Bridge or Bank, they may be &s;ure that the Beavers are not far off. They come as near as they can, but as &s;oon as the Beavers &s;ee or hear them, they run through their Canal into the River; but as they mu&s;t breath from time to time, the Savages &s;oon &s;hoot them, if it be in Summer time; for in Winter they u&s;e another Art to catch them. They make holes in the Ice and ha|ving
<PB N="69" REF="36">beat out the Beavers from their Habitations into the River, they mu&s;t come to breath through tho&s;e Holes, and then the Savages catch them a|live by the Tail.</P>
<P>Having refre&s;hed our &s;elves above Ten Days in this place, and taken in Provi&s;ions, we Embarked again on the Seventeenth of <HI>December</HI> for <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilima|chinac,</HI> but eight days after were fore|ed back by a contrary Wind. The Savages were gone away, but had left &s;ome Provi&s;ions, which we wanted ve|ry much; for the Ice and the malady of our Men obliged us to continue in that place, where we &s;uffer'd very much. Finding our &s;elves in that ex|tremity, I advanced into the Woods to endeavour to find &s;ome relief, and it plea&s;ed God that I met with two Savages, of the Nation of the <HI>Outno|vas,</HI> who conducted me to a Village belonging to the <HI>Pontoualamis,</HI> where we met &s;everal <HI>French</HI>-men &s;etled in that place, by whom we were kindly receiv'd, as al&s;o by the Savages. Father <HI>Zenoble</HI> under&s;tanding that the Je&s;uits had a Settlement in the bottom of the Bay, thought it was more becoming his Character, to pa&s;s the Winter a|mong&s;t
<PB N="70" REF="37">them, than in company of the Savages, and went thither two days after our arrival; but we continued 'till the next Spring in that place, and liv'd very comfortably.</P>
<P>We diverted bur &s;elves at Hunting wild Bulls in the beginning of <HI>March,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they Hunt Bulls.</NOTE> the Gra&s;s being already grown. Tho&s;e Bulls are near twice as big as ours, the Hair looks like a fine Fleece, and is very long; their Horns are bent backwards, and extraordinary long; their Eyes are likewi&s;e larger and big|ger than tho&s;e of our <HI>European</HI> Bulls, which make them look terrible. They go always by Droves of three or four Hundred in each. When the Savages go a Hunting, they encompa&s;s a Drove of the&s;e Bulls, and one of them comes creeping as near as he can, and then &s;tands up, making an Out-cry, which frightens away the whole Drove; the Savages being in a Circle, they cannot e&s;cape without being &s;hot; but as they become very fierce and dangerous when they are wounded, the Savages &s;hoot them in the Thigh or the Shoulder, to prevent their coming upon them, and when they are down, they break their Heads with Clubs. As they are ex|cellent
<PB N="71" REF="37">Mark&s;men, they never mi&s;s, and twenty Men will &s;ometimes kill Forty and Fifty Bulls.</P>
<P>That which is wonderful in this, is the havock, which the Shot &s;ent by the Savages makes; for be&s;ides the ex|actne&s;s and &s;wiftne&s;s of the Stroke, the force of it is very &s;urprizing, and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e it is nothing el&s;e but a Stone, or a Bone, or &s;ome|times a piece of very hard Wood, pointed and fa&s;tned to the end of an Arrow with &s;ome Fi&s;hes-glue, that cau&s;es this terrible effect. When the Savages go to War, they poi&s;on the Point, or extremity of their Dart, &s;o that if that remains in the Body, Death follows of nece&s;&s;ity; the only Re|medy in this ca&s;e, is to draw out the Arrow through the other &s;ide of the Wound; if it goes quite thorough, or if not, to make an aperture on the other &s;ide, and &s;o to draw it through; after which they know by in&s;tinct, cer|tain Herbs, the application of which both draws out the Venom, and Cures 'em.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed all the Month of <HI>March</HI> in this place: Father <HI>Zenoble</HI> came back to me at Spring, and we re-embark|ing
<PB N="72" REF="38">at the Creek we had left, came to Land at <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilimachinac</HI> in the begining of <HI>April,</HI> with a de&s;ign to &s;tay there for M. <HI>de la Salle.</HI> From the 11th of <HI>September,</HI> 1681, when we took our leaves of the <HI>Illinois,</HI> to the 1&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> Seven Months were &s;lipt away; during which time, M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> upon the Advice that I had gi|ven him by my Letter, was come down to the <HI>Illinois</HI> with a good Re|cruit, with intention to help us.

It was with this De&s;ign, that after Six Days re&s;t, M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> &s;et out in a Canoo for <HI>Fronte|nac,</HI> Father <HI>Zenoble</HI> and I going along with him; haying &s;ailed happily the fir&s;t day, we landed at a Village cal|led <HI>Trejagou,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Iroquois.</HI> M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> Traficked there with &s;ome Skins, and having ordered me to &s;tay for him there, with Father <HI>Zenoble,</HI> he went on board the <HI>Canoo Frontenac.</HI> There he found his Bark ready, and &s;tored her with a|bundance of Ammunition and Provi&s;i|ons;
<PB N="74" REF="39">he li&s;ted there &s;ome new Souldiers, and eight days after, lent me his Bark laden with fre&s;h Men, good Mer|chandi&s;e, and &s;uch things as were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. The Father and I went on board, and landed the fir&s;t Day at <HI>Niagara,</HI> below the Fall of the River: There we were forced to put our Baggage and Merchandi&s;e upon Sledges, and &s;o conduct them to the Lake <HI>Heri&egrave;,</HI> where we re-embark'd in a Canoo to the number of Twen|ty Per&s;ons, as well Souldiers as Mari|ners, together with our be&s;t Merchan|di&s;e. After Three days Sail, we land|ed at the &s;ide of the River of the <HI>Miamis,</HI> where having lodg'd our &s;elves in Huts, I had time to rea&s;&s;em|ble there &s;ome <HI>French</HI> and &s;ome Sa|vages, <HI>Abenaguis, Loups, Quicapous,</HI> and others. There I augmented our Provi&s;ions by Hunting, and I bar|ter'd &s;ome of our Commodities for <HI>In|dian</HI> Corn.</P>
<P>There it was that M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> came to rejoin us towards the end of <HI>No|vember;</HI> the day of his Arrival we, fell down the River of the <HI>Miamis</HI> in a Canoo, to the Mouth of another River named <HI>Chicacou;</HI> and we went
<PB N="75" REF="39">up it again to a &s;mall Harbour, which is but a League from the great Ri|ver of the <HI>Illinois.</HI> Having put on Shore in this place, we pa&s;&s;ed the Night with a very great Fire; for the Cold was &s;o &s;harp, that the next day the Rivers were froze and un|navigable. We were obliged then to have recour&s;e to the Sledge, to car|ry our Baggage to the Village of the <HI>Illinois,</HI> where we found things in the &s;ame &s;tate that M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> had left them; only the Village was better Peopled; which gave us opportunity to defer our Intrigues a little, and to renew our Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Rivers being &s;till block'd up with Ice, we found our &s;elves oblig'd to begin again our Journey by Land; the Third day of <HI>January,</HI> 1683. we had pu&s;ht on our way to Thirty Leagues below. There the Weather grew mild, and the Ice melted, &s;o that Navigation appearing commodi|ous, we went on Board a Canoo, the Twenty Fourth of <HI>January,</HI> and fell down the River or the <HI>Illinois,</HI> to the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> where we arri|ved the &s;econd of <HI>February.</HI></P>

<P>Being &s;urpriz'd, or rather charm'd, with the Beauties of this Savage Court, I addre&s;s'd my Speech to the vene|rable Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Di&s;|cour&s;e ad|dre&s;s'd to the Prince of the&s;e Sa|vages.</NOTE> and &s;poke to him in the Name of M. <HI>de la Salle.</HI> That having the Honour to be &s;ent by the King of <HI>France,</HI> the mo&s;t potent of all the Kings upon Earth, to make a Di&s;|covery of all the Nations of <HI>America,</HI> and to invite them to live under the Government of &s;o great a Prince; we came to offer them our Friend&s;hip and Protection; to which the upper Countries had all freely &s;ubmitted: That if we did pretend to &s;ettle our &s;elves in the Country, it was not &s;o much to bring them under a rigorous Yoke, as to maintain for them, by the power of our Arms, what was alrea|dy in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and to impart to them our rare&s;t Arts and our Wealth: Not &s;o much to &s;poil them of their Trea&s;ures, as to teach them a more advantagious way of u&s;ing them. Not to U&s;urp their Territories, but put them in a way to Cultivate and Improve them, and to in&s;truct them in our Commerce. In &s;hort, not to become their Lords and Matters, but
<PB N="88" REF="46">to E&s;tabli&s;h a Brotherly Friend&s;hip with them.</P>
<P>The Prince all this while hearken'd with great Attention, (and one of our <HI>Abenaguis</HI> having given him to under|&s;tand what I &s;aid) embraced me, and with a &s;miling Countenance, told me, That after the Account I had given him of our great Monarch, he could not but conceive the greate&s;t Re&s;pect and Veneration for him; that he &s;hould the next day &s;ee M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> and that he would give him more par|ticular a&s;&s;urances of it. Whereupon I pre&s;ented him in M. <HI>de la Salle</HI>'s Name, with a Sword inlaid with Gold and Silver, &s;ome Ca&s;es of Razors, Cizars, and Knives, and &s;ome Bottles of <HI>A|qua vitae.</HI> I cannot expre&s;s the Joy and &s;atisfaction he receiv'd the&s;e &s;mall Pre&s;ents with. But I took notice at the &s;ame time, that one of his Wives, who had a pair of the Cizars in her Hand, admir'd very much the neat|ne&s;s of the Work, and would now and then give me a Smile, which I fancied might be a mode&s;t way of asking me for a pair too. I took an opportunity to draw near to her, and pulling out of my Pocket a &s;mall &s;teel
<PB N="89" REF="46">Ca&s;e of Filligreen-work, wherein was a pair of Cizars, and a little Tor|toi&s;e-&s;hell Knife, and pretending to ad|mire the whitene&s;s and finene&s;s of her Garment, I &s;lipt the Ca&s;e into her Hand, and &s;he received it, &s;queez|ing my Hand pretty hard. Which gave me rea&s;on to think, that the&s;e Women have not Hearts altogether &s;o Savage, but that they might ea&s;ily be tamed by us, and taught the Politer Arts of Conver&s;ation. Another of the Com|pany, who was not le&s;s pretty, and neatly accoutred, drawing nearer to us, gave me to under&s;tand by the Thorns &s;he &s;hewed me, which &s;he made u&s;e of to fa&s;ten her Train, that &s;ome Pins would be very acceptable to her. I gave her a paper of 'em, together with a Ca&s;e of Needles and a Silver Thimble. The&s;e little Trin|kets &s;he received with a wonderful joy; and then I gave as much to the two others. She who was the fine&s;t and the mo&s;t agreeable of 'em, hav|ing taken notice that I admir'd a Collar of large Pearl that &s;he had a|bout her Neck, took it off, and made an Offer of it to me, with abundance of civility. I refus'd it a good while,
<PB N="90" REF="47">but reflecting upon the plenty of Pearls that is among them, and that the fi&s;hing for 'em was in the Seas there|abouts, I made no further difficulty, and after a few more offers, I accept|ed of it. But, in return, I gave her ten Yards of Blew Ribbon, which &s;he valued, at lea&s;t, at as high a rate.</P>
<P>The Night now drawing on, I was going to take my leave of the Prince, but he very earne&s;tly de&s;ired me to &s;tay 'till the next day, and gave the charge of me to an Officer, to let me want for nothing. I did not want much Court&s;hip, and the de&s;ire I had to &s;ee a little of their Manners and Behaviour, made me readily enough accept of the kind offer. I was con|ducted into an Apartment furni&s;hed much after the rate of that the Prince was in. There they brought me a Collation of Wild-fowl, and Fruit, and &s;ome Liquors, of which I ta&s;ted. All that while there was an Old Gentle|man with me, who was very good Company, and e&s;pecially becau&s;e he re&s;olved me all the Que&s;tions I put to him. As for what concerns their Politicks, he inform'd me, that they were in|tirely
<PB N="91" REF="47">govern'd by their Prince's Ab|&s;olute Will. That they obey'd him as their Soveraign; that they own'd his Children his lawful Succe&s;&s;ors; that when he died, they &s;acrificed his fir&s;t or Chief Wife, the fir&s;t Steward and twenty Men of his Nation, to be his Retinue and wait upon him in the other World. That during his Life, no Man drunk in his Cup, nor eat out of his Di&s;h, or walk'd as he was pa&s;&s;ing by; that care was al|ways taken, not only to clean the Way for him, but al&s;o to &s;trew it with &s;weet Herbs and Flowers. I ob&s;erv'd in that little time I was in his Pre&s;ence, that when he &s;poke to any body, they made a loud kind of humming before they an&s;wer'd him; and I'begg'd this Old Gentleman to tell me the Rea&s;on of it: He told me that this was lookt upon as a token of admiration and re&s;pect. As to their Religion, he told me that they Wor&s;hip the Sun; that they had their Temples, their Altars, and their Prie&s;ts. That in that Temple, there was a Fire which burnt perpetually, as the proper Emblem of the Sun.
<PB N="62" REF="48">That at the Decrea&s;e of the Moon, they carried a great Di&s;h of their greate&s;t Dainties to the Door of the Temple, as an Oblatory Sacrifice; which the Prie&s;ts offer'd to their God, and then they carried it home, and fea&s;ted them&s;elves with it.</P>
<P>As to their Cu&s;toms, every Spring they go in a Body to &s;ome retir'd place, and there turn up a large &s;pace of Land, which they do with the Drums beating all the while. After this, they take care to call it the <HI>De|&s;art,</HI> or the <HI>Field of the Spirit.</HI> And thither they go in good earne&s;t, when they are in their Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Fits, and there wait for In&s;piration from their pretended Deity. In the mean while, as they do this every Year, it proves of no &s;mall advantage to them, for by this means they turn up all their Land in&s;en&s;ibly, and it becomes abundantly more fruitful. In Autumn they gather their <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and they keep it in great Baskets 'till the New Moon in the next Month of <HI>June:</HI> Then the Families get to|gether, and every one invites his Friends
<PB N="93" REF="48">and Neighbours, to come and eat Cakes, and &s;ome Meat they get like|wi&s;e; and thus they &s;pend the Day in Fea&s;ting.</P>
<P>This is all I could learn that Day of their Religion, their Government and Cu&s;toms. The next Day I had the Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing their Temple, and the Old Gentleman had me thi|ther. The Structure of it was exact|ly the &s;ame with that of the Prince's Hou&s;e. As to the out-&s;ide, it is en|compa&s;&s;ed with a great high Wall, the &s;pace betwixt that and the Tem|ple forming a kind of Court, where People may walk. On the top of the Wall are &s;everal Pikes to be &s;een, up|on which are &s;tuck the Heads of their own mo&s;t notorious Criminals, or of their Enemies. On the top of the Fronti&s;piece, there is a great Knob rai&s;|ed, all covered round with Hair, and above that, an heap of Scalps in form of a Trophy.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of the Temple is only a <HI>Nave,</HI> painted on all &s;ides, at top with all &s;orts of Figures; in the mid&s;t of it is an Hearth in&s;tead of an Altar, upon
<PB N="94" REF="49">which there is continually three great Billets burning, &s;tanding up on end; and two Prie&s;ts dre&s;t in White Ve&s;t|ments, are ever looking after it, to make up the Fire and &s;upply it. It is round this that all the People come to &s;ay their Prayers, with &s;trange kind of Hummings. The Prayers are three times a Day; at Sun ri&s;e, at Noon, and at Sun &s;et. They made me take notice of a &s;ort of Clo&s;et cut out of the Wall, the in&s;ide of which was very fine: I could &s;ee only the Roof of it, on the top of which there hung a couple of &s;pread Eagles, which look'd towards the Sun. I wanted to go into it; but they told me that it was the Ta|bernacle of their God, and that it was permitted to none but their High Prie&s;t to go into it. And I was told that this was the Repo&s;itory of their Wealth and Trea&s;ures; as Pearls, Gold and Silver, precious Stones, and &s;ome Goods that came out of <HI>Europe,</HI> which they had from their Neighbours.</P>
<P>After I had &s;een all the&s;e Curio&s;i|ties, I took my leave of all tho&s;e
<PB N="95" REF="49">that were with me, and went back with my two Interpreters, to M. <HI>de la Salle;</HI> to whom I gave a faithful Account of the good Entertainment I had received from the Prince of the <HI>Tacucas;</HI> of his Magnificence, and e&s;|pecially of his good Inclinations to acknowledge the King's Authority. Some time after we &s;aw him coming towards us, in a very magnificent Barge, with Drums beating, and the Women that attended him playing on &s;everal In&s;truments: Some of them were in his own Barge, &s;ome in others that went along by the &s;ide of it. M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> received him in a re&s;pectful manner, and yet with that gravity as be&s;t became him, con|&s;idering the Character he bore. He thanked him for the honour he did him, and told him he did not receive it but in the Name of the Prince his Ma&s;ter; and that as he did not doubt but he was willing to acknow|ledge his Power, &s;o he might &s;afely a&s;&s;ure him of his Royal Friend&s;hip and Protection. The Prince of the <HI>Tacuca</HI>'s made An&s;wer, That what he had heard of the Grandure of the <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="96" REF="50">King, and of the Valour of his Sub|jects, would not permit him to he&s;i|tate, in paying him in Per&s;on the Hommage which he was per&s;waded was due to him whom he repre&s;ent|ed; and that tho' he was a Soveraign, he chearfully &s;ubmitted to our great King's Power; and that he &s;hould be glad to merit our Alliance and Pro|tection by his Services. After the&s;e mutual Prote&s;tations of Friend&s;hip, they made each other their Pre&s;ents. M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> pre&s;ented him with two pieces of Ribbon, and &s;ome Trinkets for his Wives. The Prince gave him &s;ix of his riche&s;t Robes, a Collar of Pearl, a <HI>Piroque</HI> or Barge filled with Ammunition and Provi&s;ion; after which, there was brought a Dozen of Bottles of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> prepar'd with Sugar and Almonds, and Apricock Kernels. Then the King's Health was drunk, with a di&s;charge of all our Guns, after that of the Prince of the <HI>Tacuca</HI>'s in like man|ner; after which he went again in|to his <HI>Piroque,</HI> and went away very well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>We continued all that Day on that
<PB N="97" REF="50">Shore, where we took the Altitude, and found our &s;elves at the 25th Degree of Latitude, the next day being the 22d of <HI>March</HI> 1693, we went and lay ten Leagues off</P>
<P>M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> perceiving a <HI>Pi|roque,</HI> that made up towards us, to &s;ee what we were, gave me or|ders to cha&s;e it; which I did; but as I was ju&s;t going to lay hold of her, above a Hundred Men &s;traight appear|ed on the Shore, with their Bows ready to &s;hoot us. M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> with loud calling after me, made me &s;top; and being come back to his Company again, we went all and &s;tood over again&s;t them with our Muskets ready pre&s;ented. This po&s;ture of ours frighted them, and made them lay down their Arms; and I was immediately ordered to go and carry them the <HI>Calumet.</HI> Be|ing come up to them, I offer'd them the Collar of Peace; they accepted it very civilly; they embraced me, and gave me to under&s;tand, that they would be Friends with us. M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> &s;eeing in what an ob|liging
<PB N="98" REF="51">manner they had received me, came to join us on the &s;ame Shore; and as &s;oon as tho&s;e Sa|vages perceived him to be our Chief, they paid him all kind, of Honours and Re&s;pect. He told them that he did not require any thing from them, but a chearful Acknow|ledgment and Submi&s;&s;ion to our great King's Orders; to which he added, for their encouragement, the Example of the other greater Na|tions, and made u&s;e of the Argu|ments he before u&s;ed on like occa|&s;ions. They an&s;wer'd him, that they had their Prince, and that they could determine nothing with|out his Orders, and offer'd either to bring him to us, or to conduct, us to his Dwelling. M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> who was always glad of an Op|portunity of &s;eeing the Situation, Manners, and Faculty of tho&s;e Na|tions, cho&s;e the latter. Their Vil|lage was four great Leagues off from the Shore. We were no &s;ooner come into it, but the Prince came to receive us; he had us into his Cottage, where he treated us very
<PB N="99" REF="51">hand&s;omly, it was the Prince of the Nation of the <HI>Naches.</HI> This People is divided into two Provin|ces; this was the lea&s;t of the two. Their Territories are &s;eldom above Twenty Leagues compa&s;s, and their greate&s;t Revenues is the Pearl Fi|&s;hery which they have in the Sea about them.</P>
<P>There is a great many Divers of that Nation, who dive to the bottom of the Water, and fetch up the&s;e precious Shells from the lower|mo&s;t part of the Rocks. On a fair day you may &s;ee the Shells on the Rocks open them&s;elves to receive the Dew of Heaven. Which Dew breeds the fir&s;t Seeds of the Pearl within the Shells, which appear like little white Grain that &s;ticks fa&s;t to the Shell. The&s;e &s;mall &s;oft Grains do in time become hard and white, as we &s;ee they are. It is ob&s;erved that the Pearls which are fetch'd from the bottom of the Sea, are fairer than tho&s;e which are found on the Rocks, becau&s;e the Sun
<PB N="100" REF="52">tarni&s;hes the&s;e, and the Thunder is de&s;tructive to their Seeds.</P>
<P>This little Prince pre&s;ented M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> with &s;ome Dozens of 'em, of a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s; and in return, we gave him a Hatchet, a Kettle, and &s;ome Knives. They gave us be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;ome Provi|&s;ions; and having &s;taid there the whole Day, we went away the next very well &s;atisfied with each other. They gave us a couple of Guides, to &s;hew us the way into the other Nation of the &s;ame Name, which is Ten Leagues farther in the Country. In the mean time M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> &s;ent two of our Men to carry &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions to tho&s;e that waited for us by the Water &s;ide, together with Orders to fall Ten Leagues lower down the River, and to &s;tay for him there.</P>
<P>Thus we went under the Con|duct of our Guides, and came that Night to the great Village of <HI>Na|ches.</HI> This Nation is able to &s;et
<PB N="101" REF="52">out Three Thou&s;and Men in any time of War. Their Land is very well Cultivated, and bears <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, all &s;orts of Fruit-Trees, O|live-trees, and Vines. There are va&s;t Meadows to be &s;een there; va&s;t Fore&s;ts and all &s;orts of Cattle; Fi&s;hing and Hunting being all their Employment and their Wealth.</P>
<P>The Prince received us with a great deal of Joy; made us a great many Pre&s;ents both of Pearl and Provi&s;ions, and treated us very ge|nerou&s;ly. The next day we plant|ed there the King's Arms, giving a Volley of Shot; after which we took our leaves of the Prince, who a&s;&s;ured us of his intire Submi&s;&s;ion; and we went to meet our Men with new Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Being got aboard our Canoos, we went forward, and about Eight Leagues off, we came to the Village <HI>Coroas,</HI> where the Prince receiv'd us as the re&s;t had done, and paid Homage.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="53">
<P>The next day being the 27th of <HI>March,</HI> 1683. we planted our Huts at the Mouth of a great River, which comes from the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and is called <HI>La Sablonniere;</HI> Ten Leagues from hence, as we continued our Cour&s;e, we found the River di|vide it &s;elf into three Channels; I took the Right-hand-&s;tream, M. <HI>de la Fore&s;t</HI> took the left, and M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> the middle way; we fol|lowed each our Cour&s;e for about Ten Leagues, and in a little time after, we &s;ound our &s;elves re-join'd by the uniting of the Three Streams again into one. We were hardly got together again, and gone for|ward Five or Six Leagues, but we e&s;pied &s;ome Fi&s;her-men by the Wa|ter-&s;ide, who were <HI>Quinipi&s;&s;a's.</HI> As &s;oon as they &s;aw us come near, they allarmed all the te&s;t of their Men, and &s;traight the Drum fell a beating, and the Shore was in an in&s;tant lined with Savages, all armed with Bows and Arrows; we were willing to &s;end Four <HI>French</HI> Men to treat with 'em, but they
<PB N="103" REF="53">were &s;everely &s;ent back by a &s;hole of Arows; after which, four of our Savages offer'd to go to &s;ee what they could do, but they were u&s;ed in like manner; in &s;o much that M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> not willing to run a|ny further ri&s;que here, he bid us leave them in quiet, and trouble our &s;elves no further with them.</P>
<P>Twelve Leagues from the <HI>Qui|nipi&s;&s;a</HI>'s, we fell to the Right, on the Village call'd <HI>Tangibao;</HI> we found it pillag'd, &s;ack'd, and a great Heap of dead Bodies one up|on another. This &s;ight &s;truck a mighty honour in us, and conclud|ing that it was not good &s;taying there, we went on; and about Ten Leagues further, we be|gun to find the Water bracki&s;h; the Shore &s;eemed &s;omewhat more extended, and all &s;trewed with Shells of different &s;hape and figure, &s;ome like drinking Cups, &s;ome like Snails ending in a &s;piral point, and all of a mo&s;t agreeable varie|ty of Colours. We kept on &s;till, and alter an Hours failing, we put
<PB N="104" REF="54">our &s;elves into a Canoo, and kept along the Coa&s;t, the better to take our Ob&s;ervation of the Shore, and &s;o came back to land at the River's Mouth.</P>
<P>This was on the Seventh of <HI>A|pril,</HI> 1683. The fir&s;t thing we then took care to do, was to re|turn our humble thanks to Almigh|ty God, for our good Succe&s;s, and for that he had carried us in &s;afe|ty to the end of our Voyage, after more than Eight Hundred Leagues, &s;ailing and rowing with &s;o &s;mall a handful of Men, and &s;o little Am|munition; and that through &s;o ma|ny barbarous Nations, which we had not only di&s;cover'd, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure made &s;ubject to us. We Sung the <HI>Te Deam;</HI> after which, taking our Canoos, and our Equi|page upon Sledges, we went and planted our Huts a little above the Shore, to be out of the reach of the Sea, which wholly overflows it, af|ter &s;ix Hours Ebb, during which it's left quite dry.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="54" MS="y">
<P>Having pitched here our New Camp, we &s;a&s;tned a Cro&s;s to the top of a large Tree, and &s;et up the Arms of <HI>France:</HI> After which we rai&s;ed three or four Huts more, and Entrenched our &s;elves there. Then M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> took the Alti|tude, to know where the Mouth of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> was. The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had attempted to find it out, tho' in vain, had already given it the Name of <HI>Del Rio A&s;condido.</HI> Ac|cording to M. <HI>de la Salle</HI>'s Calcu|lation, it is between the Twenty &s;econd and Twenty third Degree of Latitude; that it throws it &s;elf into the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> with a large Channel which is Twenty Leagues wide, and very deep and Navigable.</P>
<P>M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> would be a little acquainted with its Shores, before he would leave them. It is cer|tain that they are not fit to be in|habited, by rea&s;on of the frequent Inundations by the Spring-Tides,
<PB N="106" REF="55">and the Barrenne&s;s of the Shore; there is nothing but Canes and Reeds, and Woods overthrown. But about a League and a half within the Country, it is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant in the World, fine large Meadows, fair Woods full of Mulberry-trees, Nut-trees, and Che&s;nut-trees. The Fields are covered with all &s;orts of Fruit-Trees, as Orange, Lemmon, Pomegranate, and the &s;ides of the Hills with Vines, and the Fields bear <HI>Indian</HI> Corn twice a Year. We &s;aw in all their ponds and Ri|vers va&s;t quantities of Water-Fowl, Gee&s;e, Ducks, and Teal, Moor-hens, &amp;c. and in the Woods and Fields, Partridges, Phea&s;ants, Quails, and other kind of Fowl; of four Foot|ed Creatures all &s;orts, e&s;pecially one large &s;ort of Oxen, which they call <HI>Cibola</HI>'s; the&s;e are much larg|er than any hath been mention'd, and are rai&s;ed like a Cammel from the Chine to the middle of the Back; they feed among the Canes, and go together &s;ometimes no le&s;s in number than Fifteen Hundred.
<PB N="107" REF="55">They Hunt them them after a par|ticular manner. When they are in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Canes, where there is no coming at them, the Savages get round about them, and &s;et fire to 'em in &s;everal places, e&s;|pecially when the Wind is &s;ome|thing high, which makes at fir&s;t a mighty &s;moke, which turns all of a &s;udden into a Flame, and this &s;trikes &s;o great a terrour into the Herd, that they all di&s;per&s;e them|&s;elves, and the Savages, who lie in wait upon Trees, &s;hoot &s;ome with Arrows, &s;ome with Bullets, and make an incredible Slaughter among them. By good Fortune, the Sa|vages <HI>Tangibao, Quinipi&s;&s;as,</HI> and <HI>Na|ches,</HI> had been a Hunting when we were there (for they always join when they Hunt them) and they left us three fine large ones, which we &s;eiz'd, and having dre&s;t them, they fea&s;ted us all for three Days, and we had &s;ome left the day we went away from thence.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="56">
<P>M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> having a mind to go and give an Account of his Di&s;coveries to Count <HI>Frontenac,</HI> and to confirm the Nations he had gone through in the good e&s;teem of us, re&s;olved to go up the &s;ame River back again to the <HI>IIlinois,</HI> and thence for the Lakes, in order to get to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> and from thence &s;et Sail for <HI>France,</HI> and give the Court a true account of his Suc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Eleventh of <HI>April</HI> of the &s;ame Year 1683, we got in a Ca|noo on the &s;aid River; we were about Sixty of us. As this River divides it &s;elf into three Channels, about Fifty Leagues from the Sea, we came the fir&s;t day to the place where they met together, and in Six days after that, to the Point where it divides it &s;elf: There our Victuals failing, it was highly nece&s;&s;ary to look about us. The fir&s;t Relief we met with, were &s;ome Crocodils; we kill'd two of 'em
<PB N="109" REF="56">in a little while, that were pretty large: The fle&s;h of them is good, white, firm, and very well ta&s;ted. It is as firm as Tunny, and near in ta&s;te to Salmon, and we fea&s;ted on it for &s;ome days. The Stream of our River began now to grow &s;tronger again&s;t us, &s;o that we were forced to get on Shore, and u&s;e our Sledges, as far as <HI>Quini|pi&s;&s;a</HI>'s. As this People had given us a &s;curvey welcome as we came down, we were forced to con&s;ult how we &s;hould do to make them a little more tractable, wherefore we &s;ent two <HI>Abenaguis,</HI> and two <HI>Loups</HI> towards them. They met with four Women only, which they brought to us that Night. This Prize plea&s;ed us very well, hoping that by their means, we &s;hould be&s;t compa&s;s our De&s;igns. We u&s;ed tho&s;e Women with all the Civility and Prudence imaginable; and being come near to their Village, the next morning we &s;ent one of them home with &s;ome &s;mall Pre|&s;ents, to &s;hew that we did not
<PB N="110" REF="57">come in an Ho&s;tile manner, only wanted their Friend&s;hip, and what was chiefly nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ome Recruits of our Provi&s;ions. She &s;hewed them all the little Gewgaws we had given her, and related to them what good Entertainment &s;he had received from us, and what De&s;igns we came upon. Immediately they &s;ent four of the Chief of their Nation to us, who brought along with them &s;ome Provi&s;ions, and invited us to come and be merry with them. We then re&s;tored the Three Wo|men into their Hands, and we came nearer to them, but &s;till &s;tanding upon our Guard. When we were come into their Village, they pre|&s;ented us &s;ome of their Fruits, and &s;ome Water-Fowl pretty well dre&s;t. After this Refre&s;hment, we retired about a Hundred Paces from them, and lodged in our Huts that Night, be|tween the Village and the River. By break of Day the&s;e treacherous Rogues &s;urrounded, and attacked us: But they mi&s;t of their aim; for we had &s;et Sentinels, all that Night,
<PB N="111" REF="57">and with their fir&s;t Approach, we were prepared to receive them. We killed five or &s;ix the very fir&s;t blow, upon which the re&s;t fled; and we pur&s;ued them a little way, and having killed three or four more, we thought that was enough, and we took their Scalps with us to &s;erve for a Trophy.</P>
<P>From thence we went forward to the <HI>Naches;</HI> we had hid &s;ome <HI>In|dian</HI> Corn there, as we went down, and we found it again in very good condition. The Prince came &s;traightway to receive us; M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> after the fir&s;t Compliments pa&s;s'd, pre&s;ented him with the Scalps of the <HI>Quinipi&s;&s;a</HI>'s we had brought with us, who were his greate&s;t Enemies. Which made it the more grateful, and &s;erved to &s;hew him that we were not Men to be fool'd with.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing he did, was to give order for &s;omething to be fetch'd to refre&s;h us; which we
<PB N="112" REF="58">freely accepted of. All this while we ob&s;erved that we &s;aw no Wo|men in the Village, which made us &s;u&s;pect &s;ome Roguery. Not|with&s;tanding we kept eating and drinking, and never &s;eem'd to take any notice of any thing, but we kept our Arms all the while. A little while after we &s;pied a great number of Men in Arms drawing towards us, and we in an in&s;tant put our &s;elves in a po&s;ture of de|fence. But the Prince bid us fear nothing, and a&s;&s;ured us that we never needed to entertain any &s;u&s;|picion of them; he went up to 'em and commanded them to halt. Af|ter which, he told us, that it was a Party of his Men who had been again&s;t the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> but that they for their own part were re&s;olved ever to maintain a firm Friend&s;hip with us. His words he confirmed by &s;ome Pre&s;ents that followed, as al&s;o &s;ome Provi&s;ions, which we heartily and thankfully received, leaving them, by way of return, &s;ome of our Canoos, which indeed
<PB N="113" REF="58">were but cumber&s;ome to us; and that we came off &s;afe and &s;ound, but we attributed our &s;afety to our care and watchfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>After this, we continued our Cour&s;e toward the <HI>Tacuca</HI>'s, and the <HI>Akanc&eacute;a</HI>'s, who received us very hand&s;omly at our Landing.</P>
<P>Thus, pa&s;&s;ing through &s;o many different Nations, we made try|al of the faithfulne&s;s of &s;ome, and the treachery of others; and by a due mixture of mildne&s;s and &s;eve|rity, and a con&s;tant care, we did not only fru&s;trate their De&s;igns, and avoid their Ambu&s;h, but we brought them to Terms, and made them &s;ubmit to us.</P>
<P>On the Twelfth of <HI>May,</HI> 1683, we left the <HI>Akanc&eacute;a</HI>'s, and pu&s;hed forward to the Mouth of the Ri|ver of the <HI>Illinois;</HI> after which we went on along the Shore, quite up to the Fort <HI>Preudhomme,</HI> where M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> fell dangerou&s;ly ill. Father <HI>Gabriel</HI> &s;taid with him, with a good many of his Men; and I was commanded to go with Twen|ty of his Men to <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilamachinac,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="59">to look after his Affairs. I left him there the Fifteenth of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>I went the fir&s;t Day to lie at <HI>Ouabaches;</HI> where I was made very welcome.</P>
<P>Twenty Leagues further, I met with &s;ome <HI>Iroquois.</HI> The&s;e Sava|ges, who are the mo&s;t barbarous of all others, are &s;neakingly &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive when their Party is the weake&s;t, but mo&s;t unmerciful when they have an advantage. There was but Five of them that met us; and they told us we &s;hould not go far e're we &s;hould meet a Company of above Four Hundred Men well Armed. This Advice made us take care to &s;tand upon our Guard, for truly it is not very &s;afe to fall into the Hands of the&s;e Barbarous People when they march in a Body. We had not gone a quarter of a League, but we &s;pied a little Army, which we took at fir&s;t to be <HI>Iroquois,</HI> but they were <HI>Tavaroa</HI>'s who had joined them&s;elves with &s;ome <HI>Illinois.</HI> They &s;eeing our Fire-Arms, took us for <HI>Iroquois,</HI> and were going to &s;urround us, with a De&s;ign to burn us, for that
<PB N="115" REF="59">is the u&s;ual way of dealing with tho&s;e barbarous Fellows, when&s;oe|ever they get any of them; &s;o great is the abhorrence which all Nations have again&s;t them. But the <HI>Illinois</HI> having di&s;cover'd who we were, they unbent their Bows, and gave us part of their Provi&s;i|ons. We pur&s;ued our Road to the River <HI>Chicacou,</HI> and after Twenty Days Journey, we at length arri|ved at <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilimachinac,</HI> in the begin|ing of <HI>July;</HI> where we &s;taid for M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> who came and join|ed us in <HI>September</HI> the &s;ame Year. He &s;tayed there but three Days, to give &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Orders. He gave me the command of Fort St. <HI>Louis,</HI> with orders to &s;ee it fi|ni&s;hed, and a full power to di&s;|po&s;e of the Lands adjacent, and left all his Men under me, except &s;ix <HI>French</HI> Men he took with him to <HI>Quebeck.</HI> We went away the &s;ame Day, he for <HI>Canada,</HI> I for the <HI>Il|linois.</HI></P>
<P>I went directly to <HI>Miamis,</HI> at the head of Forty Men, <HI>French</HI> and Savages. I came to it on the 6th
<PB N="116" REF="60">of <HI>January,</HI> 1684, and vi&s;ited the Fort, which was in a very good condition. There I left Ten of my Men well Armed, and pur&s;u|ing my Journey, I got, by the end of the Month, to Fort St. <HI>Louis.</HI> I &s;et Men at work about it imme|diately, and in le&s;s than two Months time I compleated it. Pre&s;ently af|ter this, I invited all the Neigh|bouring Nations to come to it.</P>
<P>There needed no great pains or Art to get them thither. The beauty of the Country, the fruit|fulne&s;s of the Land, the convenien|cy of a fine Navigable River; the nearne&s;s of about a Hundred diffe|rent Nations, and of tho&s;e little Lakes, or rather little Seas, which make it a fit Seat of Commerce for all <HI>North America;</HI> and reach from the River St. <HI>Laurent</HI> to the Gulf of <HI>Mexico.</HI> In &s;hort, the ad|vantagious Scituation of this Fort, which was de&s;ign'd as a Bulwark for all the Nations that &s;hould come to &s;ettle there, again&s;t Nations, was a &s;ufficient Invitation and Induce|ment
<PB N="117" REF="60">to them to come and dwell there. So that in a little time, there was above Five Hundred Huts made up, and in le&s;s than two Months, there was a wonder|ful great concour&s;e of People of all Nations. By this it is ea&s;ie to be &s;een, with how little difficulty the Savages might be tamed, and po|li&s;hed, by planting here and there &s;ome Colonies of <HI>Europeans.</HI> For how few &s;oever they be, they are, as it were a oiment of Concord and civil Society among&s;t the mo&s;t bar|barous Nations.</P>
<P>In the mean while M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> being arriv'd at <HI>Quebec,</HI> had the di&s;|&s;atisfaction not to meet with M. <HI>la Comte de Frontenac;</HI> for he had been re-manded to <HI>France</HI> by an Order from Court, and was gone thither. After his Arrival, he did not fail to acquaint all the City with the Di&s;coveries he had made, and with the News of &s;o many Nations yielding them&s;elves &s;ubject to the King's Power. The <HI>Te De|um</HI> was &s;ung, as an acknowledg|ment of this happy Addition of
<PB N="118" REF="61">glory and Honour to the Crown. The earne&s;t de&s;ire which M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> had, to go to give the King and his Mini&s;ters an Account of the &s;ucce&s;s of his Travels, made him ha&s;ten his Departure. He went from <HI>Canada</HI> in the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> 1684. But before he &s;et Sail, he &s;ent the Chevalier <HI>de Bogia</HI> to me, as a Per&s;on that had been highly recommended to him. He came to me to St. <HI>Louis</HI>'s Fort. I received him as well as I could, and gave him the be&s;t Entertain|ment that my Condition would per|mit me.</P>
<P>On the Twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> in the &s;ame Year; having received Ad|vice, that the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> being jea|lous of our new E&s;tabli&s;hment, were coming again&s;t us with con|&s;iderable Forces; I &s;ent an Expre&s;s to M. <HI>de la Durontai,</HI> Governour of the Fort <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilimachinac,</HI> for &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In the mean while I rai&s;ed new Fortifications, and by means of good Ditches, Rampires, and other Works, I put the Vil|lage into a good po&s;ture of De|fence.
<PB N="119" REF="61">They came on the 28th of <HI>March,</HI> and lay before us, to the number of Five Hundred; we beat them back bravely in their very fir&s;t Attacks; at la&s;t, after Six Weeks, we rai&s;ed the Siege, and forced them to retire with the lo&s;s of Four&s;core of theirs, and not of one of ours. They took a few Slaves in the Neighbourhood, that they might have &s;omething to Brag of, and might not be thought to come back empty; but as they were ju&s;t a going to flea their Scalps, the poor Wretches were happily &s;o cunning as to get away, and came to us in our Fort.</P>
<P>About the 15th of <HI>April,</HI> M. <HI>de la Durontai,</HI> and Father <HI>de Loy</HI> a Je&s;uit, with Sixty <HI>French</HI> came to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, but it was needle&s;s then. In the mean, while M. <HI>de la Barre</HI> was come to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> to &s;ucceed the Count <HI>de Frontenac.</HI> This Change was a dreadful blow to New <HI>France</HI> in general, which look'd upon Count <HI>de Frontenac</HI> as their Patron. But it proved no le&s;s &s;evere, in re&s;pect to my own par|ticular.
<PB N="120" REF="62">For no &s;ooner was this new Governour come over, who was a Friend and Relation of the Chevalier <HI>de Bogia,</HI> but he gave him the command of St. <HI>Louis</HI>'s Fort; the ri&s;e and perfection of which were all owing to me. He directed his Orders to M. <HI>de la Du|rontai,</HI> to deliver to me; who in|formed me with the new Gover|nour's Orders, to give up my Command of the place, and to in|ve&s;t the Chevalier therewith. I could do no other but obey the Orders. I left &s;ome con&s;iderable Ef|fects in the Fort, whereof I made an Inventory, which the Chevalier was &s;o kind as to &s;et his Hand to; and I left the place the &s;ame day, taking with me what was of mo&s;t moment and u&s;e. I fir&s;t took the Road of <HI>Montreal,</HI> and thence went to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> where I arriv'd in the beginning of <HI>July.</HI> I could do no le&s;s than go and wait on the Governour, and give him a faithful Account of the Condition and Importance of the place, which I had left by his Order, and of the &s;tate of the Country in general.

<PB N="121" REF="62">he heard me very courteou&s;ly, and very civilly offer'd me any other Po&s;t I &s;hould de&s;ire in <HI>America.</HI> I thank|ed him for his kind Offers, and told him, I was not willing to take any Employment until M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> came back; and &s;o we parted.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I arriv'd, I did not fail to write to <HI>M. de la Salle,</HI> and give him an Account how I was &s;erved, and how I thought my &s;elf wronged, by being thus put out of the Command he had given me. Adding, that I really thought there might be &s;ome Danger of the Peoples &s;itting unea&s;ie under a new Governour, and for&s;a|king their new Habitations, or com|mitting &s;ome Di&s;order. I writ be&s;ides to M. <HI>de la Fore&s;t,</HI> a Friend of mine, to &s;upport my Intere&s;ts with our com|mon Protector. The&s;e Letters had all the good effect I could wi&s;h or hope for.

I had the &s;atisfaction to learn from him what a gracious reception M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> had met with at Court, and what con&s;iderable For|ces
<PB N="122" REF="63">the King had granted him to &s;et|tle the Colonies in the New-found-lands; and withal that he was im|bark'd for the Gulf of <HI>Mexico;</HI> but what compleated my joy was, that I triumphed over mine Enemies, by my re&s;titution to St. <HI>Louis</HI>'s Fort, in the Quality of Governour, and Cap|tain; for which this Gentleman brought me the Letters which M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> had obtain'd from the King in my favour.</P>
<P>I equipp'd my &s;elf &s;traightway with Arms and all Materials nece&s;&s;a|ry, as well for the Fortification of the place, as for the rai&s;ing of my Company.

<P>The Ice putting a &s;top to our Voy|age on the River of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> we were forced to &s;tay and Winter at <HI>Montreal,</HI> until the next Spring, in 1685.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> we got up the River again as far as the Fort
<PB N="123" REF="63"><HI>Frontenac,</HI> where I took my leave of M. <HI>la Fore&s;t.</HI> I went in a Canoos on the fir&s;t Lake to <HI>Magara,</HI> where af|ter I had &s;hot the fall of the River, I got to <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilimachinac,</HI> and then to <HI>Miamis,</HI> and being come to the Mouth of the River of the <HI>Illinois,</HI> I went to Fort St. <HI>Louis,</HI> about <HI>June</HI> 15 in the &s;ame Year.</P>
<P>The Chevalier <HI>de Bogia,</HI> immedi|ately entertain'd me with all po&s;|&s;ible marks of Joy, Friend&s;hip, and Re&s;pect; and I endeavour'd to make a &s;uitable return to his Kindne&s;s; but at la&s;t, after having inform'd him of M. <HI>de la Salle</HI>'s Embarking, and of all other News then &s;tirring; I found my &s;elf oblig'd to &s;hew him the Let|ters Patents, to be Commander in Chief, and Governour of Fort St. <HI>Lou|is,</HI> with which the King thought &s;it to honour me. He receiv'd this Or|der with a great deal of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and put me again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, with all the Effects with which I had entru&s;ted him, a&s;&s;uring me, at the &s;ame time, that neverthele&s;s he &s;hould &s;till be ready to do me &s;er|vice upon all occa&s;ions, and always
<PB N="124" REF="64">to perform the Office of a faithful Friend. We &s;pent the re&s;t of the day together in amicable Conver&s;ation, and the next Morning he departed a third time for the Town of <HI>Quebeck.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>Miamis</HI> and the <HI>Illinois,</HI> neighbouring Nations and our Allies, being at variance about, cer|tain trivial preten&s;ions; I endeavour'd to reconcile them; having, receiv'd from both Parties Ho&s;tages and Pledges of their Fidelity. In the be|ginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> being much di|&s;turb'd that I had heard no News of M. <HI>de la Salle,</HI> I pa&s;s'd over to <HI>Mi&s;&s;ili|machinac,</HI> to make &s;ome Enquiry after him.

<PB N="125" REF="64">tight Ships, given him by the King, and that apparently he mu&s;t needs have arriv'd at the Mouth of the Ri|ver <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> or in &s;ome other Port.</P>
<P>This Letter &s;erv'd only to increa&s;e the Earne&s;t de&s;ire I had to meet him, in&s;omuch that I immediately took care to provide what Supplies I could for him; fitted out Twenty <HI>Canadi|ans,</HI> and returning to the <HI>Illinois,</HI> with my new Recruits; I arriv'd within a Month, at St. <HI>Louis</HI>'s Fort: Where, after having given nece&s;&s;ary Orders, I left the Command of the Place to the <HI>Sieur de Bellefontaine;</HI> and &s;et for|ward with Forty Men for the Gulf of <HI>Mexico.</HI> Thus we pa&s;s'd down our River into the great one of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> follow'd its Cour&s;e to the Sea, and &s;pent about two Months in perform|ing this Voyage.</P>
<P>Upon our Arrival on the Sea &s;hore, not meeting with what I &s;ought for, nor any Per&s;on who could give me any Information about the matter, I &s;ent out two Boats, <HI>viz.</HI> one to the <HI>Ea&s;ty</HI> and the other to the <HI>South-we&s;t,</HI> to endeavour to make &s;ome Di&s;cove|ry: They row'd up and down about
<PB N="126" REF="65">Twenty Leagues from one &s;ide to a|nother, along the Coa&s;t, and having de&s;cry'd nothing, were oblig'd to &s;tand in for &s;ome Port for want of Fre&s;h Water, and return'd to join our Fleet, after a Cour&s;e of two days; without being able to get any notice of what I expected. All that I receiv|ed from them by way of Con&s;olation, was only a Porpoi&s;e, and &s;ome very &s;ine Shells of Mother of Pearl, which they took on a Rock.</P>
<P>Therefore perceiving that it would be to no purpo&s;e to wait there any longer, I advis'd with the mo&s;t prudent Men of our Company, about the Cour&s;e we ought to &s;teer at our re|turn. I was inclin'd to follow the Coa&s;t as far as <HI>Menada,</HI> hoping by that means, continually to di&s;cover &s;ome new Country, or to take &s;ome good Prize: But the mo&s;t part were of the contrary Opinion; affirming it was &s;afer to keep a known Road, rather than to take one that was not &s;o, and which otherwi&s;e could not but be of very difficult pa&s;&s;age; as well by rea|&s;on of the High Lands along the Coa&s;ts, as for the great number of Rivers that
<PB N="127" REF="65">unload them&s;elves into the Sea; &s;o that we were oblig'd to take a Re&s;o|lution to return the &s;ame way that we came.</P>
<P>Before our Departure, having ob|&s;erv'd, that the Tree on which M. <HI>de la Salle</HI> had caus'd a Cro&s;s, with the Kings Arms to be &s;et up, was ready to be thrown down by the boi&s;trou&s;|ne&s;s of the Winds and Waves, we got up a little higher, where having E|rected a large Pillar, we fixt a Cro&s;s upon it, and underneath the Arms of <HI>France.</HI> We lodg'd that Night in the &s;ame place, but the next Morning being <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Monday, <HI>A.

<P>On our &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of 20 Leagues from <HI>Niagara,</HI> we found Means to meet with a numerous Party of <HI>Engli&s;h, Iroquois,</HI> and <HI>Ouabaches,</HI> who under the Conduct of Major <HI>Gregory,</HI> were conveying a great quantity of Brandy, Provi&s;ions, Ammunition, and Merchandizes, to the Inhabitants of the <HI>Iroquois.</HI> We fell upon 'em; and after having kill'd the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> and of the other Savages, we &s;eiz'd on their Baggages and Mer|chandizes, took a great number of Slaves, and carry'd away above 25 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men Pri&s;oners.

<PB N="134" REF="69">to <HI>Niagara,</HI> where we compleated the Building of the Fort in &s;ight of the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> and even at the very Foot of their Habitations.</P>
<P>The pro&s;perous Succe&s;s of our Arms in the beginning oblig'd us to &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger to the Governour, to give him an Account of every thing that had pa&s;s'd, and <HI>M. de la Foret,</HI> who was very de&s;irous to accept of this Commi&s;&s;i|on, &s;et forward with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed. <HI>M.

<P>We encamped for &s;ome Days in that Place, and the Army under the Com|mand of <HI>M. de Lude</HI> and <HI>M. de la Du|rontay</HI> came to joyn ours. The next day after their Arrival we did not &s;tay a moment, e're we took a Re&s;olution to force the Enemies Camp; who being inform'd of bur De&s;ign, by their Spies, did not think fit to wait for our
<PB N="136" REF="70">Approach, but decamp'd with great Precipitation. We found in their Camp &s;ome Remainders of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and other Provi&s;ions, which we made u&s;e of to our Advantage, and we &s;pent the Night in their Tents, or rather Huts; the Sea&s;on being already very far advanc'd. The next Morning we &s;ent back all our Allies to their &s;everal Ter|ritories, with Orders to meet together again upon the fir&s;t Summons; while the <HI>Sieurs de la Lude</HI> and <HI>de la Durontay</HI> repair'd to their Re&s;pective Stations.</P>
<P>As I was marching to mine, I met with certain <HI>Hurons,</HI> who gave me to under&s;tand, that I was ready to be &s;ur|rounded with the whole Army of the <HI>Iroquois.</HI> There was no longer any Means to have recour&s;e to <HI>M. de Lude,</HI> and <HI>de la Durontay,</HI> who were already embark'd in Canoos on the Lakes; in&s;omuch, that I was oblig'd to cau&s;e my &s;mall Band of Men to halt, and in&s;tantly to di&s;patch a Courier to <HI>Nia|gara</HI> to demand &s;peedy Succours of the Commander of the new Fort. It hap|pen'd accidentally, that <HI>M. de la Val|rom&egrave;,</HI> the Governour of it, &s;uppo&s;ing us to be engag'd with the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> was leading up Fifty Fu&s;ileers to our Relief,
<PB N="137" REF="70">and in the mean while the Me&s;&s;enger whom I &s;ent, having met with him, inform'd him of our pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s, which caus'd him to ha&s;ten his March: His Arrival in&s;pir'd us with new Cou|rage, &s;o that the Enemies appearing, we &s;et our &s;mall Army in Battel-array; yet when we had advanced towards 'em within Musket-&s;hot, they had not the Courage to &s;tay for our com|ing up, but &s;uddenly turn'd their Backs upon us: Whereupon we pur&s;ued 'em for &s;ome time, till about 100 of them peri&s;h'd on the &s;pot, and the re&s;t found Means to e&s;cape into the Woods. Then I immediately caus'd a Retreat to be founded; and having convoy'd <HI>M. de Valrom&egrave;</HI> on part of his way, I judg'd it expedient to take up our Winter-Quarters at <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilimachinac,</HI> and to re|&s;ide there till the next Campaign, in ca&s;e the War &s;hould continue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iro|quois</HI> forc'd to &s;ubmit.</NOTE>The Scene of Affairs began now to be chang'd; for the <HI>Iroquois</HI> re&s;ign'd to us their Habitations that were near <HI>Niaga|ra;</HI> made a Pre&s;ent of their be&s;t Skins to the Governour; and engag'd that for the future they &s;hould not di&s;turb the Tranquillity of the Nations that were under our Protection, and who were
<PB N="138" REF="71">our Allies. A Treaty of Peace being thus concluded, I &s;et forward in my Journey to the Country of the <HI>I&s;linois</HI> in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1687. and &s;hould have been very well &s;atisfied with the Succe&s;s of the Campaign, if I had not been continually troubled, by rea&s;on of <HI>M.

<PB N="139" REF="71">
<P>As &s;oon as I enter'd my Hou&s;e, I was extremely &s;urpriz'd, there to meet with <HI>M. Cavelier, M. De La Sall</HI>'s sown Brother, and indeed, I did not di&s;cern in his Countenance that free and &s;pright|ly Air, which u&s;ually appears at the fir&s;t Meeting of two Friends, after a long In|terval of Separation: However, the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of my Joy, not permitting me to make long Reflections, I incon|tinently embrac'd him, and at the &s;ame time enquir'd of him about his Brother's Welfare. Upon this Addre&s;s, he appear'd to be altogether put to a &s;tand; &s;o that a &s;ad Look up to Hea|ven, a deep Sigh, and a certain Effort, which he &s;eem'd to make within him|&s;elf, were taken by me as &s;o many ill Omens; I earne&s;tly entreated him to conceal nothing from me, and after he had recover'd him&s;elf a little, he told me very po&s;itively, <Q>That <HI>M. de la Salle</HI> his Brother was in perfect Health; but that the ill Succe&s;s of his Naviga|tion had &s;o far pull'd down his Spirits, that he had &s;carce Courage to conti|nue his Cour&s;e; that in returning by &s;mall Voyages, he took delight in trading with the different Nations, whom he met with; and that ha|ving
<PB N="140" REF="72">charg'd him to go before, to give me notice of his Arrival, he de|termin'd &s;till to re&s;ide among the <HI>Na|ches</HI> and <HI>Akanceas</HI> for &s;ome time, to purcha&s;e certain Merchandizes of both tho&s;e Nations.</Q></P>
<P>The A&s;&s;urance, with which he &s;poke to me, joyn'd with a Shew of downright Integrity, which was na|tural to him, be&s;ides the Deference due to a Per&s;on of his Character; for he was a Prie&s;t, would not &s;uffer me in the lea&s;t to call in Que&s;tion the vera|city of his Relation, and &s;erv'd a lit|tle to encourage me again&s;t my &s;ad Pre&s;ages. Therefore I entreated him to give me an Account of his Voyage, and to let me know when they re-em|bark'd, and at what time they landed. Since then I gave him a great deal of Scope, to deliver his Mind ingenuou&s;ly, and without Con&s;traint, he began to relate the particular Circum&s;tances with &s;o much the more Freedom.</P>
<P>He told me at fir&s;t, <Q>That the whole Court of <HI>France,</HI> being charm'd with the great Di&s;coveries made by <HI>M. de la Salle,</HI> the King made no &s;cruple at all to grant him the Supplies he de|&s;ir'd; not to mention the Titles of
<PB N="141" REF="72">Honour, that procur'd him greater Authority in his new Plantations: That they &s;et out from <HI>France, July</HI> 24. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1684. with four Ve&s;&s;els, very well provided of all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and above 200 Men, as well Soldiers as Artificers of all &s;orts of Trades, and that neverthele&s;s by a Complication of Misfortunes, their whole Fleet was reduc'd to a few Boats, and that great number of Per|&s;ons, to Seven or Eight <HI>French</HI> Men, who &s;erv'd as a Convoy to his Bro|ther during his Return.</Q></P>
<P>Fora&s;much as the&s;e Remarkable Cro&s;&s;es afforded Matter of Wonder, I could not choo&s;e but be very de&s;irous to be inform'd of all the Particulars of their Adventures: Whereupon <HI>M. Cavelier</HI> re&s;uming his former Narra|tive from the beginning of their Navi|gation, told me, <Q>That after a Calm which continued for &s;ome Days, in the Latitude of St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> they were &s;uddenly &s;urpriz'd with a vio|lent Storm; in&s;omuch, that one of their Ships, laden with Merchandizes, to the value of above Thirty Thou&s;and Livres, was hurry'd away with a furious Bla&s;t of Wind, and afterwards
<PB N="142" REF="73">taken by certain <HI>Spani&s;h</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Piroques.</NOTE> Rovers: That the re&s;t of the Fleet ca&s;t Anchor before the &s;ame I&s;land, where they were &s;oon refitted, and &s;upply'd with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, which with the Mer|chandizes there bought, &s;erv'd for the Cargo of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, but that the greate&s;t part of the Mariners, by li|ving &s;omewhat too licentiou&s;ly, con|tracted very dangerous Di&s;ea&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That they cruis'd about from thence towards the I&s;lands of <HI>Caimant,</HI> and took in fre&s;h Water on that of <HI>Cuba;</HI> where, having found many Tuns of Canary, good Brandy, Sugar, and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn left unguarded, they &s;eiz'd on the whole Cargo, and got &s;uch Repri&s;als as were &s;ufficient to make 'em amends for the lo&s;s of every thing that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken from them before: That afterwards being &s;upply'd with all manner of Provi&s;ions, they &s;et Sail again; and that having always had a favourable Gale of Wind, they would have en|ter'd the Gulph of <HI>Mexico;</HI> but that perceiving the Currents to be very rapid, and the Shelves to be nume|rous, they were oblig'd to &s;tand off from the Shoar, which hinder'd <HI>M.
<PB N="145" REF="73">de la Salle</HI> from lighting on the exact degree of Latitude, for the Mouth of the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi;</HI> in&s;omuch, that to avoid the expo&s;ing of the Men to greater Dangers, he order'd 'em to land at the Bay of <HI>Spiritu Santo,</HI> 50 Leagues below the River they &s;ought for: But two Days after, hoping to di&s;cover it, they got on Board their Ships again, and always taking care to &s;teer into the Main, to &s;hun the Rocks and Shelves, they at la&s;t ar|riv'd a great deal higher in a Bay, afterwards known by the name of St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> This Bay is of a very con|venient Depth for a Harbour; but 'tis dangerous landing there, as well by rea&s;on of the Shelves of Sand that encompa&s;s it; as for the Rocks with which 'tis be&s;et on all &s;ides.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed the mi&s;&s;ing of the Entrance of the River (continued he) would have been no great Detriment to us; for after having once arriv'd &s;o near its Mouth, it would have been difficult to de&s;cry it, at lea&s;t by Land; after|wards to convey our Ships thither; to form a kind of Harbour, to pre|vent Mi&s;takes for the future; and e|ven to build a regular Port; but ill
<PB N="144" REF="74">Luck would have it, that after <HI>M. de Beaujeu,</HI> who commanded one of the three Ve&s;&s;els, was come on Board our Ship; the two others were lo&s;t, as well by the ill Management of the Pilot, as by the Carele&s;ne&s;s of the Mariners; for the fir&s;t ran upon a &s;helf of Sand in the Mouth of the Bay, from whence it was impo&s;&s;ible to get her off, notwith&s;tanding our utmo&s;t Endeavours; altho' indeed we were &s;o fortunate as to &s;ave the Men, and the be&s;t of our Effects. The other Ship was da&s;h'd in pieces a|gain&s;t a Rock, even in the very Har|bour, with the lo&s;s of the mo&s;t part of the Mariners; but we had luc|kily unloaded it of all our Pro|vi&s;ions and Merchandizes: Be&s;ides, that the greate&s;t part of our Compa|ny and Goods were &s;et a&s;hoar by <HI>M. de Beaujeu,</HI> who after having been a Witne&s;s of our Misfortunes, &s;et Sail to return for <HI>France.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>M. Cavelier</HI> having thus related the Di&s;a&s;ters that befel their Fleet, pro|ceeded to give the following Narration of the other Adventures and Occurren|ces that happen'd during their Voyage. <Q>To reckon <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> from <HI>July</HI> 24.
<PB N="145" REF="74"><HI>A.

<PB N="146" REF="75">
<P><Q>In the mean while, <HI>M. de la Salle</HI> growing more impatient than ever to recover the River of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> made Incur&s;ions on all &s;ides to de&s;cry it. Fora&s;much as that whole. Country is divided by a great number of Ri|vers that empty them&s;elves at divers Intervals into the Bay; he &s;ometimes travell'd by Land, and &s;ometimes in a Canoo, accompanied with Ten or Twelve <HI>French</HI> Men, arm'd with good Fu&s;ees: At every one of tho&s;e Di|&s;tances he met with &s;everal Habita|tions of the Savages, and every where abundance of all &s;orts of nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions, even &s;o much as tame Fowl.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At la&s;t after Fifteen Days &s;earch he met with a &s;pacious River, and follow'd the Cour&s;e of it for Seven or Eight Leagues to the Place, where it rolls into the Sea, and perceiv'd it to be really that which he had &s;o long &s;ought for, and the Mouth of which he was not able to di&s;cover: There|fore he took an Ob&s;ervation of its La|titude again, that he might not mi&s;s it, in ca&s;e he &s;hould have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s thro' the Gulph at any other time. Thus being well &s;atisfied with this Di&s;cove|ry, and yet more delighted with the
<PB N="147" REF="75">Fruitfulne&s;s of the adjacent Territo|ries, he return'd to his new Colony, but as an addition to his former Mis|fortunes, he &s;oon found that &s;ome of his Men died, quite worn our with tho&s;e lingering Di&s;ea&s;es, which they had contracted at St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and that above Forty of them were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated by the Savages. He was ex|tremely afflicted at &s;o great a lo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">; but having fortify'd him&s;elf again&s;t immoderate Grief, he &s;ummon'd tho&s;e that were left (the number of whom did not amount to 100) encourag'd 'em, and exhorted 'em to take care that by the Means of their Labour, mu|tual Concord, Indu&s;try and good Cor|re&s;pondence with the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> they might make Advantage of the Riches that Nature afforded 'em, in great Abundance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Since the newly di&s;cover'd Coun|tries appear'd to <HI>M. de la Salle,</HI> to be &s;o many conquer'd Provinces; and in regard that all the Lo&s;&s;es he might &s;u&s;tain &s;eem'd to him to be of no ac|count, in compari&s;on of one Nation, that was voluntarily &s;ubdu'd; he en|deavour'd to comfort him&s;elf with the Hopes of better Succe&s;s in the Un|dertaking
<PB N="148" REF="76">of &s;ome other Voyages, and thus having taken a new Re&s;olution, he determin'd to di&s;cover tho&s;e va&s;t Territories which are &s;ituated between the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to the South-ea&s;t. On the 22d. Day of <HI>April,</HI> 1685. he &s;et out from St. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Bay for this new Voyage, tak|ing along with him only Twenty Per&s;ons, among whom were our two Nephews, <HI>Cavelier</HI> and <HI>De Moranget,</HI> a Father of the Order of <HI>Recolet</HI> and my &s;elf.

<P><Q>On the fir&s;t Day we pa&s;s'd above 20 Rivers, the Territories lying round about which, appear'd to us to be as it were an inchanted Country, and conver&s;ed with a very obliging &s;ort of People, who deny'd us nothing.

<P><Q><HI>M. de La Salle</HI> being inform'd of their good Intentions, did not fail to convey him&s;elf thither the next Day, and &s;aw the principal Elders of the Nation, who were all adorn'd with Plumes of Feathers, and cloath'd with their riche&s;t Skins, coming to meet him, and the di&s;tance of 200 Paces from the Village.

We could di&s;cern among them, as well as
<PB N="164" REF="84">among the <HI>Cenis,</HI> &s;ome Tincture of the Chri&s;tian Religion. For &s;ome of 'em made the Sign of the Cro&s;s, and others expre&s;s'd to us by certain Marks the manner of celebrating the Ma&s;s; in|&s;omuch, that we clearly perceiv'd it to be the Effect of &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;i|ons: But 'tis not to be doubted, the Increa&s;e would be much greater; if the&s;e fir&s;t Seeds of Religion were &s;ow'd among 'em by Per&s;ons, to whom they have le&s;s Aver&s;ion.

<P><Q>Notwith&s;tanding the great &s;atisfa|ction we had among tho&s;e Savages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sad Di&s;|a&s;ters.</NOTE> yet we met with two &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ters; one of which was the De&s;ertion of Four of our <HI>French</HI> Men, and the other was my Brother's Sickne&s;s. As for the four De&s;erters, it is not known whe|ther they were excited by the Plea|&s;antne&s;s of tho&s;e Countries, to endea|vour to &s;ettle them&s;elves among &s;ome of the Neighbouring Nations; or whe|ther
<PB N="165" REF="84">being entic'd by the alluring Baits of the Savage&s;&s;es, they return'd to the <HI>Cenis;</HI> or whether they retir'd to the <HI>Na&s;&s;onis.</HI> However, 'tis certain, that as &s;oon as they had Hor&s;es in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they did not any longer imagine them&s;elves to be among the Savages; &s;o that we were not able to retain 'em, neither could we have any Tidings of 'em ever &s;ince that end.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As for my Brother's Indi&s;po&s;ition, it was undoubtedly the Effect of Grief occa&s;ion'd by the De&s;ertion of &s;ome of his Attendants. He fell &s;ick, <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 24. in the &s;ame Year 1685. After three Months travelling, and within 200 Leagues of St. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Bay. His Sickne&s;s was follow'd almo&s;t at the &s;ame time with that of <HI>De Moranget,</HI> our Nephew. However, during that Affliction, we had the good Luck to find among the Savages all the Help that could have been procur'd in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> except Phy&s;itians: For we had every thing that we could wi&s;h for, particularly Veal, Mutton, Pullets, Pigeons and Ring-doves; be&s;ides, all &s;orts of whole&s;ome Herbs, as well for Pottage, as for Pti&s;ans, Decoctions,
<PB N="166" REF="85">and other Remedies nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ick Per&s;ons. Our two Surgeons were al|&s;o pre&s;ent, and were very &s;erviceable to us upon this occa&s;ion; nay, the very Savages them&s;elves, as well Men as Women, gave us Meat, Fowl, and other &s;orts of Veni&s;on; in&s;omuch, that at la&s;t (thanks be to the Divine Provi|dence) by the Means of our diligent Care, both our Patients recover'd their Health, after a Months Indi&s;po&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon they had regain'd their Strength, my Brother being of Opi|nion that he ought to improve his la&s;t Di&s;coveries; and not being able to go any farther, without entring the Ter|ritories of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> from whence according to all probability, we &s;hould never have come back; took a Re&s;olu|tion to return to his new Colony. Therefore we &s;et forward again in our Journey in the end of the Month of <HI>September,</HI> 1685. But we had this Ad|vantage, that we were now in a ca|pacity to return on Hor&s;eback, where|as we came on Foot; That which was mo&s;t &s;urprizing in our new Fur|niture is that our Hor&s;es without be|ing &s;hod, had &s;o hard a Hoof, that they could go any where; and had &s;o
<PB N="167" REF="85">tender a Mouth, that they gave way to the Curb, as if they had been train'd up to it: Every one of our Compa|ny was rea&s;onably well mounted, and our &s;upernumerary Hor&s;es &s;erv'd either for Change, or in&s;tead of Pack-Hor&s;es, to carry our Provi&s;ion, Ca|noos, and other Equipage; which was no &s;mall Con&s;olation to us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>However, &s;ince the mo&s;t u&s;eful things &s;ometimes prove the mo&s;t fatal, it happen'd either accidentally, or for want of Skill, that one of our Hor&s;es occa&s;ion'd the Lo&s;s of a Savage belonging to our Retinue. For on the Banks of the River <HI>La Maligne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Croco|dile drags a Man into the Water, and de|vours him.</NOTE> on which my Brother run the hazard of being lo&s;t, a Hor&s;e prancing at the &s;ight of a huge Crocodile, threw his Rider into the Water. He had &s;carce fallen, when that ravenous Bea&s;t drag|ged him away, and devour'd him in our &s;ight. We were extremely trou|bl'd at this &s;ad Spectacle; but in &s;uch Voyages 'tis difficult to avoid the &s;ad Accidents, to which tho&s;e who undertake 'em are &s;ometimes liable. Therefore the &s;afe&s;t way for a Tra|veller is to prepare for &s;uch Di&s;a&s;ters, by quieting his Con&s;cience, and by
<PB N="168" REF="86">putting him&s;elf under the Protection of Almighty God, who is our Guide, and con&s;tant Pre&s;erve.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Fora&s;much as no Remedy could be found for this Misfortune, we con|tinu'd our Journey; and after Three Months march, we arriv'd at St. <HI>Le|wis</HI>'s Bay in the beginning of the Month of <HI>January,</HI> 1686. As &s;oon as we came near our Colony, we perceiv'd that all the Fields thereabouts were clear'd of Trees, and well cultivated. We there met with a great number of Women, and Cottages, fill'd with new Families, each Family having its peculiar Store of Provi&s;ions, with a Garden, and other Apartments. In a word, every thing &s;eem'd to pro|mi&s;e a happy Improvement, and a nu|merous Increa&s;e. My Brother was receiv'd there as the Father of this little Common-wealth, and we took great Delight in ob&s;erving the&s;e beginnings of the Incorporation of our <HI>French</HI> Men with the Savages, and the good U&s;e that every one made of the Ad|vantages of this new Plantation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In regard that my Brother's Pre|&s;ence in that Country, was nece&s;&s;ary, as well for the compleating of the
<PB N="169" REF="86">Fort, as for the modelling of this new State, we &s;ojourn'd there about Three Months longer; after the expirati|on of which time, he determin'd to return to <HI>France</HI> to get new Supplies at that Court, and to procure &s;ome Re|cruits of Trade&s;men, Artificers and Labourers, as well in favour of this la&s;t Colony, as for all the others that are planted in divers parts of Northern <HI>America.</HI> After having taken leave of every one, he &s;et out, accompany'd with 20 <HI>French</HI> Men for <HI>Canada,</HI> and travell'd by Land to the Country of the <HI>I&s;linois,</HI> in the end of the Month of <HI>March, A.

<P><Q>Altho' this Road was the mo&s;t trou|ble&s;ome, yet it &s;erv'd not only to di&s;|cover the Cour&s;e of the Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Ri|vers.</NOTE> of which we only &s;aw the Mouths, in pa&s;&s;ing down the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi;</HI> but al&s;o to give us a nearer View of all the People, who inhabit along the Banks; &s;o that we might take frequent Op|portunities to contract new Alliances with 'em.

Therefore he follow'd the re&s;t of he Company; but after Two Months march, their
<PB N="190" REF="97">Provi&s;ions failing, between the Terri|tories of the <HI>Palaque&s;&s;ons</HI> and the <HI>Noa|diches; Dan</HI> and <HI>Lantelot</HI> made an Agreement to go a hunting in the Woods, and &s;ollicited the <HI>Sieur de Moranget,</HI> to accompany 'em. The unfortunate Gentleman, without mi|&s;tru&s;ting any thing, conde&s;cended by way of Complai&s;ance, to grant their Reque&s;t. But the two Ruffians, who being excited as well by Envy, upon Account of his &s;ingular Merits, as by the implacable Hatred that they bore his Uncle, had long ago form'd a De&s;ign upon his Life; having now in&s;en&s;ibly drawn him a&s;ide, reek'd their Malice upon him, to which pur|po&s;e they gave him a blow on the Head with a Hatchet, of which he died two Hours after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Mo|ranget</HI> knockt on the Head with a Hatchet.</NOTE> like a good Chri&s;tian, heartily forgiving his Ene|mies; of who&s;e Revenge this was the fir&s;t Effort.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Day being ended, and <HI>M. de La Salle</HI> not &s;eeing his Nephew return, nor his Companions, &s;pent the Night in a &s;trange Perplexity: The next day he went him&s;elf to the Place, where he judg'd that they might have been, and was &s;oon follw'd by Father <HI>A|na&s;ta&s;ius,</HI>

The Villain impudently an&s;wer'd that he might go look him on the Bank; and indeed the Body of that unfortu|nate young Gentleman lay extended there, and two Vulturs were flutter|ing over it, to get their Prey. In the mean while tho&s;e two perfidious Wretches lay hid in the Gra&s;s, with their Fu&s;ees ready cockt; and as <HI>M. de la Salle</HI> was drawing near the Foot|man, to cha&s;ti&s;e him, he was &s;hot in the Head with three Balls, which <HI>Lante|lot</HI> had di&s;charg'd again&s;t him; where|upon he fell to the Ground with his Face all over bloody. Father <HI>Ana|&s;tu&s;ius</HI> and his Brother having heard the Report of the Gun, immediately ran to him, and found him dying, but not as yet altogether de&s;titute of Sen&s;e and Knowledge.

<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e two afflicted Relations, and the good Monk were employ'd in performing their la&s;t Devoirs to the Decea&s;ed, tho&s;e perfidious Villains ran to &s;eize on the re&s;t of <HI>M. de La Salle</HI>'s Effects; the whole Cargo con&s;i&s;ting in Ten Hor&s;es, &s;ome pieces of Linnen-Cloth and Merchandizes, to the value of about 2000 Crowns. As &s;oon as they had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Goods, the re&s;t of the Company was oblig'd to make a Vertue of Nece&s;&s;ity, and to joyn with 'em. The Brother and the Nephew, who had redeem'd their Life by &s;ilence, and by a volunta|ry Re&s;ignation of every thing, were likewi&s;e forc'd to follow the Torrent.

<P><Q>In the mean while <HI>Lantelot</HI> and <HI>Dan,</HI> who &s;et up for Commanders in chief of the Company, took up their Lodging apart; ab&s;olutely di&s;pos'd of all the Effects of <HI>M. de La Salle,</HI> at their Plea&s;ure; diverted them&s;elves at his Co&s;t; and made good Cheer.

<P><Q>Afterwards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man and the <HI>German</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their Spoils, and offer'd 'em all to the di&s;cretion of the two <HI>M. Caveliers,</HI> who only took as much as was nece&s;|&s;ary

<P><Q>I only convers'd (&s;aid I then) with the Uncle and the Father <HI>Recolet,</HI> but as for the Nephew, M. <HI>Jou&s;tel</HI> and the <HI>Chaouanou,</HI> I had no &s;ight of 'em. As for M. <HI>de la Marne,</HI> I remember that M. <HI>Cavelier</HI> told me, that he was drown'd; neverthele&s;s, I cannot re|cover my &s;elf from my Surprize, when I reflect on the Con&s;tancy and Tran|quillity of Mind, with which he relat|ed to me the particular Circum&s;tances of his whole Voyage, and all his Adven|tures. 'Tis a common Saying, that deep Sorrow is dumb, and I dare not call in que&s;tion the Sincerity of his;
<PB N="198" REF="101">but I am certain, that he has made no Scruple to cro&s;s the Proverb.</Q> He had &s;ome occa&s;ion to u&s;e Di&s;&s;imulation (re|ply'd <HI>Cou&s;ture</HI>) <Q>He was willing &s;ome|what to allay his Grief, by the telling of long Stories; and be&s;ides, he had &s;ome By-ends, and &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons for &s;uch a Deportment at that time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I very well comprehend your mean|ing (&s;aid I) he was de&s;irous to bor|row Money of me, and he was afraid, le&s;t I &s;hould refu&s;e to lend him any, if he inform'd me of his Brother's Death. But ala&s;s! I was too much indebted to his Name and Family, to deny him any thing. Would to God I had nothing left in the World, and had not lo&s;t my honoured Protector, my dear Patron, and my mo&s;t faithful Friend! But ala&s;s! all our Lamentations are to no purpo&s;e; and &s;ince we cannot repair &s;o great a Lo&s;s, let us at lea&s;t arm our &s;elves with Patience; let us al&s;o endeavour to bring to Perfection what he has &s;o happily begun.</Q></P>
<P>At that very in&s;tant I encourag'd my &s;elf in my Re&s;olution to make another Voyage, with a De&s;ign not only to carry Relief to tho&s;e poor <HI>French</HI> Men,
<PB N="199" REF="101">who were abandon'd on the Sea-&s;hoar, but al&s;o to undertake &s;ome new Enter|prize, that might afford me &s;ome Con|&s;olation for the Lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;tain'd. To that purpo&s;e I made Preparations for a new De&s;cent to the Seas, and to vi&s;it all tho&s;e Nations that were late|ly di&s;cover'd by <HI>M. de La Salle,</HI> and mention'd to me by his Brother.</P>
<P>In the mean while I receiv'd a Letter from the Marquis <HI>D'Enonville,</HI> our Governour; the Purport of which was to inform me, That we were engag'd in a War again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">War with the <HI>Spa|niards.</HI></NOTE> and by which he gave me free Liberty to make what Attempts I could upon 'em. This Letter, in Conjunction with what <HI>M. Cavelier</HI> had told me concerning tho&s;e Nations, who were ready to make War with 'em, animated me &s;o much the more to ha&s;ten my Journey. Therefore I &s;et out <HI>Decemb.</HI> 3. <HI>A.

<PB N="200" REF="102">Neighbouring People, from whom they carry'd away 130 Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;s'd to the <HI>Cappa's,</HI> who gave me very good Entertain|ment, and &s;ome time after the <HI>Toginga's</HI> and <HI>Torimans</HI> receiv'd me with the like Demon&s;tration of Friend&s;hip and Re|&s;pect. Then the Cour&s;e of my Jour|ney brought me to the <HI>O&s;&s;otoues,</HI> where I built an Hou&s;e for the Convenience of Traffick.

But a far greater Di&s;a&s;ter befel us during that Journey. For two <HI>French</HI> Men of my Company &s;tragling in the Woods to hunt, were a&s;&s;aulted by a Party of <HI>Naches,</HI> and unfortunately kill'd. We were &s;o much the more &s;en&s;ible of this Indignity, in regard that 'twas im|po&s;&s;ible for us to revenge it, not being

I readily ac|cepted of the Office; &s;o that Thirty <HI>Taen&s;as</HI> having joyn'd our Company, we arriv'd after Eight Days march, at the Village of the <HI>Nachitoches.</HI> This Nati|on con&s;titutes only one State with two others, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Oua&s;ita's</HI> and the <HI>Capi|chis.</HI> The chief Commanders of the&s;e three &s;orts of People being met toge|ther, they cau&s;ed me to &s;it down in the middle of 'em; but the Thirty <HI>Taen&s;a's,</HI> before they took their place, de&s;ir'd Leave to go to the Temple, to implore the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their God, for the obtaining a firm Peace.

Whereup|on I promoted their Intere&s;t as far as it lay in my Power, making the be&s;t of their Claim, and at la&s;t brought Matters to a good Accommodation; in&s;omuch, that the <HI>Nachitoches</HI> promis'd to &s;upply 'em with Salt, in exchange for their Skins and Grains.

During our Cour&s;e we found fifteen Cottages of the <HI>Naches,</HI> and took up our Lodging among&s;t 'em that Night, continually &s;tanding upon our Guard.

Afterwards we went out of the Champion Country to their Village, and the chief Elders enter|tain'd us at &s;everal Fea&s;ts. Then I made 'em &s;ome Pre&s;ents, and de&s;ir'd that I might have Guides to conduct me to the <HI>Quodadiquio's.</HI> They made a great deal of difficulty to grant me any, by rea&s;on that three Days ago they ma&s;&s;acred three of their Amba&s;&s;a|dors; neverthele&s;s, by the means of Entreaties and Prote&s;tations to defend 'em, they were at la&s;t prevail'd upon to furni&s;h us with five.</P>
<P>When we drew near the three Vil|lages, we di&s;cern'd the Tracts of Hor&s;es and Men on the Road, and indeed in the Morning divers Hor&s;emen appear'd, and offer'd to convey us thither. I

All the People &s;eem'd to be concern'd at their Death; and fora&s;much as they were very &s;ollicitous about that Affair, I made a Promi&s;e both to the Widows, and to the People, to take Vengeance for the Murder of their Husbands and Amba&s;&s;adors. Then they conducted me to their Temple, wa&s;h'd my Face with Water, before they permitted me to enter; and after having pray'd to God for the &s;pace of one quarter of an Hour, they led me back into the Cottage of one of tho&s;e Women, where I was magnificently entertain'd. There I was inform'd, that the Seven <HI>French</HI> Men, who were &s;eparated from <HI>Cavelier,</HI> after the Death

I reply'd, That certainly they them&s;elves had murder'd 'em; they deny'd it &s;tiffly, and fora&s;|much as I ince&s;&s;antly accus'd 'em, their Wives fell a weeping, and made me under&s;tand by their Tears, that the In|formation concerning their Death was too true.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nouadiches</HI> us'd their utmo&s;t Ef|forts to clear them&s;elves, and offer'd me the <HI>Calumet</HI> a &s;econd time; I told 'em that I would not accept of it, till I were thoroughly convinc'd of their In|nocence
<PB N="208" REF="106">as to that Point, and that never|thele&s;s if I could be &s;erviceable to 'em in any thing, they &s;hould find my Fi|delity inviolable. The chief Com|mander an&s;wer'd my kind Expre&s;&s;ions, with a Pre&s;ent of Ten &s;ine Hor&s;es, well harne&s;s'd, and I gave him &s;even Hat|chets, with a Set of Gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We left their Country <HI>May</HI> 29. and advanc'd within a Days Journey of the <HI>Palaque&s;&s;ons,</HI> where we were inform'd that the la&s;t Colony e&s;tabli&s;h'd by <HI>M. de la Salle,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> not having been able to maintain it &s;elf in a perfect Union, was quite di&s;pers'd; that &s;ome were inter|mixed with the Savages, and that o|thers found Means to get to the <HI>French</HI> Plantations in other Places. There|fore not judging it expedient to &s;eek for 'em where they were no longer to be found, I took a Re&s;olution to re|turn the &s;ame way I came. In the mean while I endeavour'd to pa&s;s to the Village of <HI>Coroas,</HI> but a prodigious Inundation happening, by rea&s;on of the extraordinary Rains, which continu'd for Three Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, we were involv'd in the greate&s;t Streight imagi|nable: For the Water every where
<PB N="209" REF="106">ro&s;e up to the middle Leg at lea&s;t; in|&s;omuch, that we were forc'd to &s;leep, and to make Fires on thick Trees, and we thought our &s;elves happy, in being then provided with Ca&s;&s;ave, Beef and Veni|&s;on: We continu'd three or four Days in this forlorn Condition, but as good Luck would have it, we di&s;cover'd a &s;mall I&s;land, which the Waters had not as yet overflow'd, and we retir'd thi|ther for a Day and a Night: Our Hor|&s;es were &s;omewhat recruited there, and the Ground being &s;uddenly dry'd by the exce&s;&s;ive Heat of the Sea&s;on, and of the Climate, we got up in a Days Journey to the Village of <HI>Coroas.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coroas,</HI> a Savage People.</NOTE> I cannot &s;uf|ficiently expre&s;s the noble Entertain|ment we met with among tho&s;e People, who employ'd &s;everal Per&s;ons every day in fi&s;hing and hunting, on purpo&s;e to treat us, and &s;upply'd us with abun|dance of Pullets, Gee&s;e, Pigeons and Turkeys. But that which redoubled my Joy is, that two of tho&s;e <HI>French</HI> Men, whom I &s;ought for among the <HI>Nouadiches,</HI> were luckily found here; and that I had so favourable an Oppor|tunity to re-unite 'em to my Com|pany.</P>
<PB N="210" REF="107">
<P>I took my leave of the <HI>Coroas, July</HI> 20th. and arriv'd on the 31th. in the Ter|ritories of the <HI>Akancea's,</HI> where I was &s;eiz'd with a Fever, which oblig'd me to &s;tay there till <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 15. After I had a little recover'd my Strength, I &s;et forward again in my Journey to the Country of the <HI>I&s;linois,</HI> and arriv'd there in the Month of <HI>September.</HI> Thus the Treaty of Peace concluded between the <HI>Taen&s;a's</HI> and the <HI>Nachitoches;</HI> the plea&s;ure of being mo&s;t kindly enter|tain'd by all the Savage People; and the Satisfaction of bringing back two <HI>French</HI> Men, whom I had given over for lo&s;t; were the Fruits of my la&s;t Voyage.</P>
<P>By this Relation one may take an e&s;timate of the Riches and Beauty of all tho&s;e Countries, inhabited by &s;o many People, that are all in a manner already brought under Subjection, and who have a perfect Idea of the Gran|deur of our Monarch. It cannot be conceiv'd how much that Continent a|bounds, as well in all &s;orts of Grain and Fruit, as in variety of Cattel. 'Tis &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with great Seas, the Shoars of which are very deep, and &s;eem to pre&s;ent us with natural
<PB N="211" REF="107">Ports; in&s;omuch, that three or four Havens on the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI> would undoubtedly &s;ecure for us the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Territories. The <HI>French</HI> are generally &s;o well belov'd, that to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of 'em, they have nothing to do but to &s;ettle there incon|tinently, and to plant their Colonies. What is wanting, may be tran&s;ported thither by our Ve&s;&s;els; as in like man|ner, what is wanting in our Country, may be brought us from thence. For from tho&s;e Parts we have our principal Stores of Skins; we might al&s;o get Silks, Timber for Ships, and divers o|ther Commodities. If there be a &s;carci|ty of Corn and Wine, 'tis le&s;s occa&s;ion'd by the defect of the Soil, than for want of the Improvement of Husbandry. La&s;tly, to procure all the Trea&s;ures of Nature, 'tis only requi&s;ite to be&s;tow &s;ome Pains in &s;eeking for 'em, and to improve 'em when found. Such is the State of Affairs in that Country: God grant that a happy and la&s;ting Peace may &s;oon put us in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;e|cure us in the Enjoyment of the&s;e Ad|vantages.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER to Mon&s;ieur</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have at la&s;t receiv'd the Relation of the Voyage, made by Capt. <HI>Montau|band,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Montauban,</HI> and I have &s;ent it you printed. You will ad|mire without all Doubt, as well as I, how by the means of his &s;ingular Prudence and Courage, he extricated him&s;elf from tho&s;e weighty Pre&s;&s;ures, under which any other Per&s;on in his Circum&s;tances, would have unavoidably peri&s;h'd: You may al&s;o call to Mind in reading the beginning of this Narrative, that you had a &s;ight of &s;ome of his Seamen at <HI>Bordeaux, A. D. 1694.</HI> from whence he &s;et out the next Year to undertake the Voyage, of which he here gives us a particular Account.</P>
<P>He gave chace to divers Ships that he met during his Cour&s;e, and engag'd at <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> with a Frigat of <HI>34</HI> Pieces of Ordnance. At St. <HI>John's Cape</HI> he came up with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>20</HI> Guns, and took her after a &s;mall Engagement. Afterwards he took a Caper of <HI>Branden|burg,</HI>
<PB REF="110">and &s;teer'd his Cour&s;e to <HI>Angola.</HI> At last he di&s;cover'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Guard-Ship, arm'd with <HI>54</HI> Pieces of Cannon near the Coa&s;t, and fought her during five or &s;ix Hours, till they both came to board|ing with great Fury. But when he was ju&s;t ready to ma&s;ter her, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cap|tain &s;et fire to his whole &s;tore of Powder, and both the Ships were blown up into the Air, with a mo&s;t dreadful Noi&s;e and Havock.</P>
<P>You may have the &s;atisfaction to take a view of &s;o terrible a Shipwreck in this Narrative, as it were on the Sea &s;hoar, and to ob&s;erve how Capt. <HI>Montauban</HI> makes his E&s;cape with Fifteen or Sixteen of his Men. He &s;uffer'd Hunger above Three Days, and at la&s;t arriv'd at <HI>Cape de Lopez,</HI> where he went to vi&s;it the King of the Country: He has given us a De|&s;cription of the Court and Kingdom of that Prince; treating at the &s;ame time of his Religion, and forming a Project for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> in tho&s;e Parts. He &s;tood Godfather to the King's Grand-&s;on, by his Son Prince <HI>Thomas,</HI> and embark'd in a <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, to return to <HI>Europe.</HI> An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of his Acquaintance took him on board his Ship, and convey'd him to
<PB REF="110"><HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where he was confin'd in a Chamber by the Order of <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> Go|vernour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> I&s;land. After|wards he was &s;et at Liberty, and tran|&s;ported to <HI>Martinica,</HI> where he was pre|&s;ent at the Death of <HI>M. de Blenac,</HI> Ge|neral of the <HI>French</HI> I&s;lands. From thence he pa&s;s'd over into <HI>France,</HI> and continu'd very doubtful thether he &s;hould try his Fortune again by Sea or not.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Particulars (Sir) are related in &s;o plain and natural a Style, that you may clearly di&s;cern the Integrity and Gene|ro&s;ity of the Author. Indeed it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that Sailers and other Per|&s;ons, taken up with the Management of Maritime Affairs, ate nothing near &s;o po|lite, as tho&s;e that have Employments on the Land, by rea&s;on that they do not keep &s;o much Company, and have not an oppor|tunity of conver&s;ing &s;o frequently with the more refin'd Wits of the Age; but to make amends for this Defect, they are ge|nerally a great deal more &s;incere. There|fore you need not fear, le&s;t a Sea-Captain &s;hould impo&s;e on your Credulity: Be&s;ides, I have often heard him making a Narra|tion of the &s;ame Voyage, yet never could perceive him to vary in the lea&s;t Circum|&s;tance; in&s;omuch, that the Candour and
<PB REF="111">free Air, with which he was wont to relate the bravest Actions that were perform'd in the Engagements, would &s;oon per&s;uade his Hearers to believe, that what he &s;aid was certainly true. Neither did he write this Narrative thro' O&s;tentation, &s;ince he him|&s;elf &s;ufficiently declares in the beginning of it, that he did it only to give an Account of his Expeditions to a Mini&s;ter of State. Lastly, if you &s;till doubt of the Fight, in which the <HI>Sieur de Montauban</HI> &s;uffer'd Shipwreck, you cannot but remember that you have read it in the <HI>Gazettes</HI> of the Month of <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> of the pre&s;ent Year.</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION OF THE VOYAGE OF THE <HI>Sieur de Montauban,</HI> Captain of the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinea, A. D.</HI> 1695.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having been &s;o often made &s;en&s;ible of the Malignant Influences of the Planet that governs at Sea; and having, by the means of a cro&s;s For|tune, lo&s;t all the Goods which I had gather'd together, with &s;o great Care and Pains, I &s;hould take no Delight in calling to Mind the Misfortunes that put an end to my la&s;t Expe|dition; were it not that the De&s;ire of being &s;till more &s;erviceable to the Publick, and to Private Per&s;ons, as al&s;o to te&s;tifie to his Ma|je&s;ty the fervent Zeal I had for his Service, did not oblige me to &s;et Pen to Paper, to
<PB N="8" REF="112">give &s;ome Account of my Ob&s;ervations to <HI>M. Phelipeaux,</HI> in which he may di&s;cern with what Earne&s;tne&s;s I penetrated into the mo&s;t remote Colonies of the Enemies, to de&s;troy 'em, and to ruin their Commerce.</P>
<P>I was not willing to enlarge this Relation with an Account of all the Voyages I made, and of all the particular Adventures that be|fell me on the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>New Spain, Car|thagena, Mexico, Florida, New-York, New-England, Newfoundland,</HI> the <HI>Canary I&s;lands,</HI> and <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> where I cruis'd up and down above Twenty Years, having begun to fol|low the practice of Navigation at the Age of Sixteen. I might al&s;o add the Expedition of the Year 1691. in which, being Commander of the Ship, call'd <HI>The Machine,</HI> I ravag'd the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> enter'd the great River of <HI>Serrelion,</HI> &s;eiz'd on the Fort of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in which there were 80 pieces of Cannon, and caus'd 'em to be blown up, that they might not be refitted: But I will confine my &s;elf to the Narrative of my la&s;t Voyage, be|cau&s;e 'tis the late&s;t, and that which is &s;till fre&s;h in Memory, as having been made known buplickly by the Report that was &s;pread abroad in <HI>France</HI> and el&s;ewhere, about the firing of my Ship, and the blowing me up into the Air, after &s;o prodigious a man|ner.</P>
<P>In the Year 1684. after having ravag'd the Coa&s;t of <HI>Carrack</HI> I got the Wind to <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> and was inform'd there, that a Con|voy of Ships was to &s;et out from the I&s;lands
<PB N="9" REF="112">of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Nevi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> for <HI>England.</HI> Where|upon I was oblig'd to go to the Latitude of <HI>Bermudas,</HI> with a De&s;ign to &s;eize on that &s;mall Fleet, and in hopes of getting a good Prize. I was no &s;ooner arriv'd, but they appear'd &s;teering directly towards me, with|out any manner of Fear; but I attack'd the Convoy, call'd the <HI>Wolf,</HI> with two other Merchant-Ships, laden with Sugar; the re&s;t having found means to e&s;cape, during the Fight. As I was carrying off this Prize, I met with another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el of Sixteen Guns, that came from <HI>Spain,</HI> and was like|wi&s;e &s;ailing for <HI>England:</HI> She &s;urrender'd after a &s;light Engagement, and I convey'd her to <HI>Rachel,</HI> where the Court of Admiralty adjudg'd her to me as lawful Prize. After having &s;old her, I brought my three other Ships to <HI>Bordeaux,</HI> where I arriv'd in the Month of <HI>September, A. D.</HI> 1694. The&s;e were in like manner allow'd to be good Prize, and I immediately &s;ought for Mer|chants to di&s;po&s;e of 'em.</P>
<P>In the mean while my Free-Booters, who had not &s;een <HI>France</HI> for a long time, being now arriv'd in a great City, in which Vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s and Luxury are predominant, were de&s;irous to make them&s;elves &s;ome a|mends for the Fatigues they had endur'd, during &s;o long an Ab&s;ence from their Na|tive Country: In&s;omuch, that they rio|tou&s;ly wa&s;ted va&s;t Sums of Money, and gave way to all Actions of Extravagance. The Merchants and Victuallers made no
<PB N="10" REF="113">&s;cruple to tru&s;t 'em, or to &s;upply 'em with whatever they de&s;ir'd, upon the Reputation of their Wealth, and the Report that was given out in the City, with reference to the great Prizes in which they had a Share. Thus they pa&s;s'd all the Nights in variety of Diverti&s;ements, and the Days in running about the Streets in Ma&s;querade, cau&s;ing them&s;elves to be carry'd in Chairs, with lighted Torches at Noon-day: This Ex|ce&s;s of Debauchery de&s;troy'd &s;ome of 'em, and four others de&s;erted me; &s;o that per|ceiving that I lo&s;t my Men, notwith&s;tanding all my Precaution, and all the Prohibitions that I could make, I determin'd to retire from the City as &s;oon as 'twas po&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve the re&s;t of my Company.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I fill'd up again the Vacancy of tho&s;e that were lo&s;t, by an equal number of young Men of <HI>Bordeaux,</HI> who in a &s;hort time were as capable of playing their Parts as the olde&s;t. And indeed, I always take a particular Care to in&s;truct my Men in the be&s;t manner of firing a Piece, and the fre|quent Exerci&s;e, with which I u&s;ually train 'em up, within a little while, renders 'em as expert in &s;hooting right at a Mark, and in handling their Arms, as the mo&s;t ancient Free-booters of the Sea, and the mo&s;t skil|ful Hunters on Land.</P>
<P>After having victuall'd my Ship, which carry'd about 34 Pieces of Ordnance, I &s;et out from <HI>Bordeaux</HI> in the Month of <HI>Februa|ry, A. D.</HI> 1695. with a De&s;ign to crui&s;e on
<PB N="11" REF="113">the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> in <HI>Africa.</HI> To that purpo&s;e I pa&s;s'd to the I&s;lands <HI>Azores,</HI> which lie in the 37th. Degree of Latitude, and rov'd up and down during Eight Days, without di&s;covering any thing. From thence I &s;teer'd to the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, &s;ituated in the 25th. Degree, and de&s;cry'd the Pike of <HI>Te|neriff</HI> at a very great di&s;tance, which is reput|ed to be the highe&s;t Mountain in the World. 'Tis reported that tho&s;e I&s;lands took their Name from <HI>Doggs,</HI> call'd <HI>Canes</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> great Numbers of which were found there by the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> I &s;ail'd round about 'em for Fourteen Days, to wait for certain <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, which (as I was inform'd) were to come that way; and indeed, they actually appear'd, but enter'd the Port be|fore I could come up with 'em; which Di&s;|appointment oblig'd me to &s;teer my Cour&s;e for <HI>Cape Blanc,</HI> and the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> which lie between the 14. and the 18. Degree of Southern Latitude. Upon my Arrival, I met with two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships riding at Anchor in the Road of the I&s;land of <HI>May.</HI> I &s;ent out my Shallop to di&s;cover 'em; and fora&s;much as &s;he brought me word, that they were Pri|vateers or Interlopers, of 30 Guns apiece, I took a Re&s;olution to take 'em by boarding; and therefore tack'd about, to make up to 'em: But whil&s;t I was running a Cour&s;e on one of the Points of the I&s;land, tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els did not &s;tay till I had tack'd about again; but &s;u&s;pecting my De&s;ign, they &s;peedily &s;et &s;ail, leaving their Cables, Anchors and Shal|lops on the Road.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="114" MS="y">
<P>I pur&s;u'd 'em all that day; but the Night approaching, I lo&s;t the &s;ight of 'em, and re|turn'd to the Road, from whence they &s;et out, to hoi&s;t up the Cables and Anchors, and to &s;ink the Shallops, to which they were fa&s;ten'd. Afterwards I &s;teer'd my Cour&s;e to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> to pay my Ship, and to take in fre&s;h Water and Wood. This I&s;land is one of tho&s;e of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> or <HI>Green-Head,</HI> where I &s;tay'd Eight Days, and at the end of that Term, having receiv'd Information from a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Bark, that there were two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateers of 20 or 30 Guns at the I&s;land of <HI>Fuogo,</HI> one of which was refitting, by rea&s;on of an En|gagement &s;he had with another Privateer, I immediately weigh'd Anchor, and made that I&s;land, which is not very far di&s;tant from tho&s;e of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> hoping to meet with the Enemies there; but upon my Arrival I was inform'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> that they had left the &s;aid I&s;land <HI>de Fuogo,</HI> five Days before, in the Night, without giving any notice of their Cour&s;e. Whereupon I &s;teer'd mine to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and touch'd fir&s;t at the Cape of three Points, where I met with the Guard-Ship which was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Frigat of 34 Pieces of Ordnance, and was crui&s;ing on the Main. She did not fail to de&s;cry me, and forthwith &s;ail'd directly towards me, to make a Di&s;covery: Fora&s;much as I al&s;o had a &s;ight of her, and wi&s;h'd for an Opportu|nity to fight her, I caus'd a <HI>Dutch</HI> Flag to be &s;et up, to avoid di&s;heartning her, and to
<PB N="13" REF="114">give her Liberty to draw near within my Cannon-Shot. When I perceiv'd her to be near enough, I put out the <HI>French</HI> Colours, and made a Signal co her to &s;trike Sail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> but &s;he incontinently let fly a Broad-&s;ide at me with a great deal of Courage and receiv'd mine in like manner. Thus we continu'd battering one another, from Morning, till Four a Clock in the Afternoon:Neither was I able to get the Weather gage, nor to come to a clo&s;e Engagement, to make u&s;e of my B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">anier Fu&s;ees to good purpo&s;e, in which con&s;i&s;ts the principal Force of our Privateers, nor to hinder her, by the means of the Advantage of the Wind, which &s;he &s;till kept over me, from ca&s;ting Anchor under the Fort of the Cape of the three Points; where there were al&s;o two ther <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, one of which carry'd 14 Guns, and the other 18.</P>
<P>I was apt to believe at fir&s;t, that tho&s;e three Ships would joyn together in que&s;t of me; &s;o that I tack'd round about during a whole Day, to wait for 'em, and ca&s;t An|chor within a League of the Road, hoping that at la&s;t the Shame of &s;eeing them&s;elves in&s;ulted over, after &s;uch a manner, would excite 'em to endeavour to revenge the Af|front. But all the&s;e Efforts were in vain, and apparently the Guard-Ship was too much di&s;abled to &s;tand in need of a &s;econd Engagement. A &s;mall <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that pa&s;s'd by &s;oon after, gave me to under&s;tand, that tho&s;e Ships were the &s;ame, that had
<PB N="14" REF="115">oblig'd the <HI>Sieur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Roy,</HI> Commander of the King's Pink, call'd the <HI>Deep,</HI> to abandon the Coa&s;t, which was afterwards confirm'd by the <HI>Sieur Roy</HI> him&s;elf, at the Prince's I|&s;land, where we happen'd to meet.</P>
<P>Thus having perceiv'd, that the Enemies refus'd to &s;ight, and judging that in would be di&s;advantageous to me to attack 'em un|der the Cannon of the Fort; I took a Re&s;o|lution to go to <HI>Cape de Lopez,</HI> and to the I&s;lands of the Prince, and of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI> By the way, I went to di&s;cover St. <HI>John's Cape,</HI> which is on the Continent of <HI>Guinee,</HI> as well as that of this three Points, and I lucki|ly met with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship of 20 Guns, la|den with 350 Negro's, Elephants Teeth, and Wax. It co&s;t me no great trouble to take her, and the Captain told me that he came from <HI>Ardra,</HI> where he took on board 550 Negro's, &s;ome of whom he caus'd to be put to Death, for revolting again&s;t the Ship's Crew, and others made their E&s;cape to Land in his Shallop, which they had ta|ken away. <HI>Ardra</HI> is one of the principal Towns of <HI>Guinee,</HI> &s;ituated on the Sea-&s;hoar, being the u&s;ual Place of Re&s;idence of a Prince, who governs a large Tract of Land in that Country.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;s'd to the Prince's I|&s;land, in the &s;ight of which I took a &s;mall Caper of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> arm'd with Eight Pieces of Cannon, and 70 Men: She was wont to crui&s;e in that Latitude, and to &s;eize on &s;mall Barks that pa&s;s'd by that way,
<PB N="15" REF="115">without any Di&s;tinction of Nation or Co|lours. Afterwards I enter'd the Harbour, to cau&s;e my Ship, which was very &s;oul, to be cleans'd, and to di&s;patch the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prize, I had taken ju&s;t before: I &s;ent her to St. <HI>Do|mingo,</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> to be condemn'd there, under the Command of the <HI>Sieur de Nave,</HI> with a &s;ufficient number of Men, whom I took out of my own Ship. But I was inform'd &s;ome time after, that &s;he was retaken by certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War, who were be|fore the le&s;&s;er <HI>Goeree.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while, not to &s;uffer my Ma|riners to lead an idle kind of Life, I gave Orders to the Officers to cau&s;e my Ship to be careen'd, and with the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> Caper I had taken, and 90 Men, whom I put on boards her, we &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e, during a Month and half, crui&s;ing up and down the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guinee,</HI> or round about the I&s;lands of the Prince, and of St. <HI>Omer,</HI> with|out meeting any Enemy. Afterwards I re|turn'd to the Road of the former of tho&s;e I&s;lands, where I caus'd my Ship to be victu|all'd with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed; and having made every thing ready, I weigh'd Anchor, and &s;tood in directly for St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s I&s;land, with a De&s;ign to &s;ell or to truck away the Caper I had taken. And indeed, I barter'd her for Provi&s;ions, not having a &s;ufficient Store to &s;erve us whil&s;t we cruis'd along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Angola,</HI> where I determin'd to pa&s;s five or &s;ix Months, to avoid a Privateer which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were building in tho&s;e Parts of
<PB N="16" REF="116"><HI>Guinee:</HI> They actually fitted out three Men of War and a Fire-Ship, to &s;eek for me in the Road of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> where they judg'd that I was to continue for &s;ome time. At my departure from that I&s;land I de&s;cry'd a Ship riding at Anchor, and making towards her, I gave her Chafe for a long time, but I could not by any means hinder her from getting a-&s;hoar, and falling in with the I&s;land of St. <HI>Omer.</HI> I mifs'd in not taking her 150 Pounds of Gold Du&s;t, which that <HI>Dutch</HI> Interloper had traded for on the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Afterwards I &s;teer'd to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>An|gola,</HI> which are &s;ituated above 250 Leagues beyond the Equinoctial Line. I arriv'd there <HI>September</HI> 22. and got Information at the di&s;tance of three Leagues from the Port of <HI>Gabin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">la,</HI> that there were two <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, laden with Negro's. Fora&s;|much as I lay under the Wind of that Port, I kept off from the Shoar, hoping that the next day the South-we&s;t Wind, that u&s;ually blows from the Main, would convey me di|rectly into the Port. That Morning, very early, I de&s;cry'd a Ship with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Co|lours making up towards me, yet I did not at fir&s;t take her to be a Man of War, but di&s;|cover'd &s;ome time after, that &s;he carry'd 54 Pieces of Ordnance. I us'd all the Pre|caution imaginable not to fright her away, and &s;et up <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours to make up to her with greater Facility: The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship on the other &s;ide did almo&s;t the &s;ame thing,
<PB N="17" REF="116">and by the Cannon-Shot, which &s;he boldly di&s;charg'd from time to time, endeavour'd to draw near us. Having perceiv'd her De&s;ign, I feign'd to wait for her coming up &s;teering very &s;lowly, to induce her to believe that my Ship was over loaded, or that our Cour&s;e was hinder'd for want of Sails, or a &s;ufficient Complement of Men. We pa&s;s'd after this manner from Break of Day, till Ten a Clock in the Morning: She ince&s;&s;antly maintain'd her Flag with Cannon-&s;hot without Balls; but perceiving at la&s;t that I did not do the like to make good mine, and that we were already come within Gun-&s;hot one of another, &s;he let off a Cannon load with Ball, which oblig'd me to put out <HI>French</HI> Colours, and to an|&s;wer her Salute. At the &s;ight of that Flag, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War, without endea|vouring to get the Wind of us, let fly two Broad-&s;ide, which I receiv'd without &s;o Men kill'd: I &s;top'd that being come a little nearer, I might render her uncapable of making an E&s;cape; u&s;ing my utmo&s;t Ef|forts to get clo&s;e within Fu&s;ee-&s;hot, deter|mining to embolden her to come on Board, &s;ince I was not in a condition to board her, becau&s;e we were to the Leeward. At la&s;t, having approach'd by little and little, and &s;eeing her within the reach of my Fu&s;ileers, who lay hid under Deck, I caus'd 'em to get up, and they made &s;o continual a Fire, that they &s;oon abated that of the Enemies.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="117">
<P>In the mean while, fora&s;much as their Company con&s;i&s;ted of above Three Hun|dred Men, and they were al&s;o &s;en&s;ible that their De&s;ign could not be accompli&s;h'd by the di&s;charging of their Cannon, a Re&s;o|lution was taken to board us, which they did with hideous Outcrys, and Threats, to give us no Quarter, unle&s;s we &s;urren|der'd: But their Grappling-Irons not being able to lay hold on the Stern of my Ship, theirs ran in &s;uch a manner, that &s;he da&s;h'd her Poop again&s;t my Bolt&s;prit, and broke it in pieces.</P>
<P>Than my Men taking the Advantage of the Hurry and Di&s;order, lo&s;t none of their aim, and fir'd &s;o furiou&s;ly for an Hour and half, that the Enemy being no longer able to re&s;i&s;t; and having lo&s;t many of their Mariners, began to de&s;pond, and retir'd underneath the Decks. I al&s;o perceiv'd almo&s;t at that very in&s;tant that they made me a &s;ign with their Hats to give 'em Quar|ter. Whereupon I caus'd my Men to de|&s;i&s;t from firing, and commanded the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to embark in their Shallops, in order to &s;urrender them&s;elves on board my Ship. At the &s;ame time I appointed &s;ome of my Attendants to leap into that of the Ene|mies, to &s;eize on it, and to prevent all manner of Surprize. I was already over|joy'd at the taking of &s;o con&s;iderable a Prize; and &s;o much the rather, in regard that after having ma&s;ter'd that Ve&s;&s;el, which was the Guard-Ship of <HI>Angola,</HI> and
<PB N="19" REF="117">the large&s;t that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had in tho&s;e Seas; I &s;hould be in a condition to ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> better Prizes, and to attack any Man of War whatever: My Men were no le&s;s joyful than my &s;elf; &s;ome of whom were going from on Board, and others were employ'd in veering the Cable, with a great deal of &s;a|tisfaction, when on a &s;uddain Fire, having taken the Powder in the Gun-room, by the means of a Match, which the Captain had left there, hoping to e&s;cape with his two Shallops; the Ships being grappl'd to|gether, were both blown up into the Air, and made the mo&s;t dreadful Noi&s;e that e|ver was heard. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to make a lively Repre&s;entation of that &s;ad Spectacle; for &s;ince the Spectators were them&s;elves the Actors in &s;o bloody a Tragedy, they knew not whether they &s;aw it or not, and were not able to judge, but of what they them|&s;elves had felt: Therefore leaving it to the Reader to imagine the Horror that might ari&s;e from the &s;ight of two Ships that are blown up into the Air with Gun|powder, above the height of 200<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Toi&s;es.</NOTE> Fathoms, forming as it were an huge Mountain of Fire, Water, Fragments of the Ships, Cords, pieces of Ordnance and Men, with a deadly Havock; during which, amid&s;t the noi&s;e of the Guns that were let off in the Air, and of the roaring Waves that &s;well'd upon all &s;ides; one might al&s;o hear the horrible cra&s;hing of the &s;hatter'd Ma&s;ts and Ta|bles, of the torn Sails and Cords; of the
<PB N="20" REF="118">Men crying out, and of the broken Bones, leaving all that I &s;ay to the Imagination of the Reader, I &s;hall only declare here what befel my &s;elf, and by what good Fortune I e&s;cap'd.</P>
<P>When the Fire took, I &s;tood on the Deck of my Ship in the Fore-Ca&s;tle, where I was giving Orders, and was blown up with &s;ome part of the Deck &s;o violently, that (as I take it) the extreme Height, to which I was hurry'd, hinder'd me from being involv'd among the Fragments of the Ships, where I mu&s;t inevitably have been cru&s;h'd in a thou&s;and pieces: I fell back into the Sea, quite &s;tunn'd, and continu'd for a long while under Water without being able to recover my &s;elf; till at la&s;t &s;trug|gling in the Water, as a Man, who is a|fraid of being drown'd, I got above it, and caught hold of a piece of Ma&s;t that &s;ay near me. Then I cry'd out to &s;ome of my Men whom I &s;aw &s;wimming round about me, and exhorted 'em to be of good Courage, hoping that we might &s;ave our &s;elves if we could find &s;ome of our Shallops. But that which troubl'd me more than my own Misfortune, was the &s;ight of two half Bo|dies, in which there was &s;till &s;ome Re|mainder of Life, floating on the Water, and leaving the Place where they &s;unk &s;tain'd with their Blood; as al&s;o to &s;ee round a|bout me an infinite number of Limbs and Members torn from Bodies, and the greate&s;t part of 'em &s;pitted on the Sprinters
<PB N="21" REF="118">of Wood. In the mean while, one of my Men having e&s;py'd an entire Shallop amid&s;t the Wreck, that &s;wam on the Water, told me that 'twas requi&s;ite to endeavour to &s;top a Hole therein, and to take out a &s;mall Boat, which was enclos'd within it. Whereupon about Fifteen or Sixteen of us, who had e&s;caped, made up to the Shallop, every one on his piece of Wood, and took &s;o great Care to clear our Boat, that at la&s;t our Attempt prov'd &s;ucce&s;sful. Thus we all got into it, and not long after &s;av'd our Ma&s;ter-Gunner, who had one of his Legs &s;hot off in the Fight. We took up three or four Ours, or pieces of Planks, that &s;erv'd us for the &s;ame u&s;e. Then we &s;ought for &s;omewhat to make a Sail, and a &s;mall Ma&s;t; and after having fur|ni&s;h'd our &s;elves in the be&s;t manner we po&s;|&s;ibly could, we entirely rely'd upon the Di|vine Providence, which alone was able to &s;ecure our Life and Safety.</P>
<P>As &s;oon us I had ceas'd from Work, I found my &s;elf all over be&s;mear'd with Blood that run our of a Wound I receiv'd in my Head, and which was apparently occa&s;ion'd by my being blown up. There fore Lint was made for me with my Handkerchief, and a Band with a piece of my Shirt, having fir&s;t wa&s;h'd the Wound with Urine. The &s;ame thing was done for others of our Company, who were wounded, whil&s;t our Shallop &s;ail'd without any &s;ight of Land, neither did we know whither we were &s;teering; but that
<PB N="22" REF="119">which added to our Affliction was, that we had no Provi&s;ions, and had already pa&s;s'd three Days without either eating or drink|ing; in&s;omuch, that one of our Men, quite worn out with Hunger and Thir&s;t, drank &s;o great a quantity of &s;alt Water, that he bur&s;t. The greate&s;t part of our Company vomited continually, whether they receiv'd any Injury from the Water they &s;wallow'd upon their falling into the Sea, as if befel me, or from that which they were noce&s;&s;i|tated to drink. As for my &s;elf, I was a long time indi&s;pos'd, &s;o that my Body &s;well'd extremely, and a great number of &s;mall Pimples broke forth throughout my Body: But I am apt to believe, the cure of my Drop&s;ie, and the Health that I have in &s;ome mea&s;ure recover'd, and which is by degrees more and more re&s;tor'd, to be chiefly owing to a Quartan-Ague, that &s;eiz'd on me a little while after that Mis|fortune. I do not reckon up the other In|conveniences that were occa&s;ion'd by &s;o de&s;perate a Blow, it being impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould not befal any Per&s;on under my Circum&s;tances. The Fire of the Powder burnt all my Hair, my whole Face, and all over one &s;ide of my Body, and I became &s;en&s;ible of that Accident, which commonly happens among the Cannoniers, who &s;erve at Sea; that is to &s;ay, I voided Blood thro' the No&s;e, Ears and Mouth. I know not whether the Bla&s;t of the Gun-powder pro|duces that Effect, by exce&s;&s;ively dilating the
<PB N="23" REF="119">Ve&s;&s;els that contain the Blood in our Body, &s;o that the ends of the Branches let it out, or whether the great Noi&s;e and Commotion that it cau&s;es in tho&s;e Organs, opliges the Veins to open: But let the ca&s;e be how it will, 'tis of no great moment, &s;ince this is not a proper Place to hold a Con&s;ultation of Phy&s;itians, as long as we are ready to be &s;tarv'd with Hunger; nor to enquire what became of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, when we had much ado to &s;ave our &s;elves.</P>
<P>We continu'd our Cour&s;e by rowing up the Current, becau&s;e we knew it came from the Port of <HI>Cabinda;</HI> but fora&s;much as the Wind was contrary, we could never reach it; and we were forc'd to content our &s;elves only to make <HI>Cape Cor&s;a</HI> if it were po&s;&s;ible, which is di&s;tan. Twelve Leagues from that of <HI>Cather&s;na,</HI> where we were not able to land, by rea&s;on of a Bar, which renders the Coa&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. That was our De&s;ign, but Hunger hinder'd us from putting it in Execution, and 'twas requi&s;ite to overcome the Ob&s;tacles that Nature laid in our way, by getting a-&s;hoar notwith&s;tanding the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> which we did at la&s;t, with a great deal of Difficulty, hoping to meet with &s;ome Ne|gro, who might &s;upply us with Victuals. Therefore one of our Company being de|tach' to &s;eek for &s;omewhat to appea&s;e our Hunger, had the good Luck to find in a Pond that the Sea had form'd hard by, good &s;tore of Oy&s;ters &s;ticking to certain Branches, and immediately ran to give us notice of
<PB N="24" REF="120">this Di&s;covery. Whereupon we all got up the Channel, to that Pond; and being arriv'd there, eat Oy&s;ters with a very good Appetite; opening 'em with Knives we had in our Pockets, which we lent one to ano|ther very charitably. After having &s;pent two Daye there, I divided my Men into three &s;mall Bands, and &s;ent 'em to &s;eek for Provi&s;ions and Habitations farther up the Land, with Orders to return to the Shallop in the Evening. I al&s;o went forth with the re&s;t, but we did not meet with an Habitati|on, nor any Foot&s;teps of Men. We only &s;aw many Herds of Buffies, of the bigne&s;s of an Ox, which fled from us as we drew near 'em . Thus the whole Day being &s;pent, without finding any thing, we all came back to the Shallop to feed upon Oy&s;ters, and took a Re&s;olution to depart from that Place the next day, to go to <HI>Cape Cor&s;a,</HI> to the Lee|ward of which is &s;ituated a large Port, where the Ve&s;&s;els that come from Crui&s;ing, take in fre&s;h Water and Wood. The Ne|gro's who inhabit the Country as &s;oon as they are inform'd of the Arrival of any Ve&s;&s;els, by the di&s;charging of their Cannon, in&s;tantly repair to the Shoar, bringing Pro|vi&s;ions to be exchang'd for Brandy, Knives, Hatchets, and other Toys. They are oblig'd to take up their Habitation far from the Sea, by rea&s;on that all tho&s;e Coa&s;ts are &s;ur|rounded with Mar&s;hy Grounds. We were no &s;ooner arriv'd at that Cape, but we heard a great noi&s;e made by the Negro's,
<PB N="25" REF="120">who came to &s;elf Wood to the Ships that lay at Anchor in the Port, and I made enqui|ry among 'em, endeavouring to find out &s;ome of my Acquaintance: For &s;ince they had very frequently &s;upply'd me with ne|ce&s;&s;ary Refre&s;hments, Wood and other Com|modities in my other Voyages; I hop'd to meet with &s;ome Per&s;ons that had Know|ledge of me; but altho I knew many of 'em, neverthele&s;s 'twas almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;wade 'em, that I was Captain <HI>Mon|tauban,</HI> in regard that I was &s;o much dis|figur'd; and they all took me for an Impo&s;tor that de&s;ign'd to impo&s;e on their Credulity. However, I took the Liberty to tell 'em in their Language, which I under&s;tood a little, that I was ready to &s;tarve with Hunger, and that I entreated 'em to give me &s;ome|what to eat: But I could not prevail by any means whatever, and 'twas ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for me to beg the favour of 'em to conduct me to Prince <HI>Thomas,</HI> who is the Son of the King of that Country, hoping that he would call to mind the good Offices I had formerly done him.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I found means to introduce my whole Company into the Pre&s;ence of that Prince. We pa&s;s'd at fir&s;t thro the Habita|tions of tho&s;e Negro's, and began by lit|tle and little, to make &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions on their Mind; in&s;omuch, that they gave us &s;ome <HI>Banna's,</HI> which are a kind of Figs, longer than ones Hand. The next day we arriv'd at Prince <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Seat, but I was
<PB N="26" REF="121">in &s;o &s;orry an Equipage, that I could not make him take any Cognizance of me, by all the &s;igns I gave him, either in the <HI>Moor|i&s;h</HI> Language, or in that of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> which he &s;peaks very fluently. Fora&s;much as in bathing with him one day, he had &s;een a Scar occa&s;ion'd by a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot I had receiv'd in my Thigh; he told me that 'twas requi&s;ite at that very In&s;tant to know whether I really were Capt. <HI>Montau|ban;</HI> and if I were not the Per&s;on, he would take Care that I &s;hould lo&s;e my Head. Whereupon he ask'd me whether I had not &s;uch a Scar; &s;o that after having &s;hew'd it to him, he immediately embrac'd me, and told me that he was very much concern'd to &s;ee me in &s;o deplorable a Condition. At fir&s;t he caus'd whol&s;ome Victuals to be di&s;tributed to all my Retinue, and caus'd 'em to be lodg'd in &s;eparate Apartments, giving particular Or|ders to the Negro's, with whom they were quarter'd, to take all po&s;&s;ible Care of 'em. As for my &s;elf, he retain'd me in his Court, and caus'd me continually to eat at his own Table. When I was a little refre&s;h'd, he acquaint|ed me with his Intention to conduct me to his Father, who&s;e u&s;ual Place of Re&s;idence was five or &s;ix Leagues di&s;tant from thence; that is to &s;ay, ten or twelve from the Sea|&s;hoar. Whereupon I gave him to under|&s;tand, that I was very &s;en&s;ible of the Ho|nour he did me, with extreme Satisfaction, and humbly entreated him at the &s;ame time to give me leave to take my Free-Booters a|long
<PB N="27" REF="121">with me, and to be&s;tow on us &s;ome Pieces of Stuff to put us in an Equipage fit to appear before &s;o great a Monarch: He conde&s;cended to grant every thing that I de&s;ir'd, &s;o that three Days after, we &s;et out altogether in a large Canoo, and pa&s;s'd up the River of <HI>Cape de Lopez,</HI> by rea&s;on that the Country is &s;o full of Fenns and Mar&s;hes, that one cannot travel thro' it by Land.</P>
<P>Upon our Arrival at the King's Court, in a Village, con&s;i&s;ting of three Hundred Cot|tages, cover'd with Palm-Tree-Leaves, where the King keeps his Wives and Relati|ons, with &s;ome other Negro Families, that have obtain'd the greate&s;t Share of his Favour; a Lodging was provided for me in Prince <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Apartments, and all my Attendants were di&s;pos'd of in others. We found the Inhabitants making great La|mentation and Mourning, becau&s;e the chief Prie&s;t of their Religion, whom they call'd <HI>Papa,</HI> dy'd that very Day; and in regard that the Funeral Pomp was to commence, which is u&s;ually continu'd for Seven Days, for Prie&s;ts of his Quality. Indeed he was in great Veneration and E&s;teem among tho&s;e People, who look'd upon him as a Holy Man. Fora&s;much as during the whole time of that doleful Solemnity, the King was in Mourning, and admitted none to pub|lick Audience, Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> advis'd me to wait patiently, and not to &s;tir out of my Lodging, unle&s;s it were to vi&s;it his Maje&s;ty, becau&s;e it was the Cu&s;tom of his Nation.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="122">
<P>However, I could not forbear going to take a view of the Funeral Proce&s;&s;ion, yet could di&s;cern nothing but a great Concour&s;e of People round about the Corps of the De|cea&s;ed Per&s;on. In the mean while, I was well entertain'd by the Order of Prince <HI>Thomas,</HI> who was gon to &s;ee his Father. Indeed there was no want of <HI>Banana's,</HI> Elephants Fle&s;h, and River-Fi&s;h; but we had neither Bread nor Wine, nor any kind of Sawce, as it may be ea&s;ily imagin'd. My Men were treated in like manner in their Apartments, during the whole time of our Abode in that Place.</P>
<P>At the end of Eight Days Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> came to us, and introduc'd as into the Pre|&s;ence of the King his Father; he is a portly Negro, of a tall Stature, well &s;hap'd, and aged about Fifty Years; who, to do me greater Honour, upon his Son's Recommen|dation, went out of his Hou&s;e, on purpo&s;e to receive me, and advanc'd &s;ome Paces for|ward to meet me. He leant on four or five Women, who &s;upported him on all &s;ides, &s;hewing a certain Grandeur, after a very confu&s;ed and odd manner. He was &s;urrounded with a great number of Negroes, arm'd with Lances and Fu&s;ees, which they di&s;charg'd from time to time with very lit|tle Order: Many Trumpeters and Drum|mers march'd before him, and at the Head of that Company were carry'd divers Stan|dards, of the Colour of tho&s;e of <HI>Holland.</HI> He had no other Cloaths than a piece of Cot|ton-Cloth,
<PB N="29" REF="122">with white and blue Stripes, with which &s;ome Parts were only cover'd by &s;everal Folds made round about his Body.</P>
<P>He was pleas'd to make me &s;en&s;ible of his Amity and Re&s;pect for me, by many Demon|&s;trations; and having &s;tretch'd out his Hand, told me, that 'twas the fir&s;t time he gave it to any Man. When we were arriv'd at his Hou&s;e, he &s;at down at the Door, and caus'd me to be placed on one &s;ide, and his Son on the other. Then he ask'd me &s;everal Que|&s;tions about the Grandeur and Power of the King my Ma&s;ter; and after I had acquaint|ed him, that he alone at pre&s;ent carry'd on a War again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> (of whom his Maje&s;ty had &s;ome knowledge, as having often &s;een 'em at <HI>Cape de Lopez</HI>) and that he likewi&s;e maintain'd it again&s;t the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> more potent Na|tions than the former, he told me that he was well &s;atisfied with my Narrative, and that he had a mind to drink a Health to the King of <HI>France.</HI> Whereupon &s;ome Palm-Wine was immediately brought to him, which was not very di&s;agreeable to the Pa|late, and his Female Attendants ferv'd him with it in a large Cry&s;tal-Gla&s;s. As &s;oon as he began to take the Gla&s;s, the Negroes and Negre&s;&s;es, who attended in great numbers, held up his right Arm, and continually kept it &s;teady in the &s;ame po&s;ture, till he had made an end of drinking. Afterwards a great noi&s;e was made with the Trumpets and Drums, and a Volley of Musket, or rather Fu&s;ee-&s;hot.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="123">
<P>Then Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> ask'd me what was the Name of the King of <HI>Frande;</HI> and after I had made An&s;wer that he was call'd <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> he told me he was de&s;irous that I &s;hould &s;tand God-father to a Child he had, aged only &s;even or eight Months, and that I &s;hould name him <HI>Lewis the Great;</HI> whereupon I could not forbear &s;miling a little. He pro|mis'd me likewi&s;e that at the fir&s;t Voyage I &s;hould make to his Country he would deli|ver him into my Hands, to be convey'd to <HI>France,</HI> and pre&s;ented to the King, for who&s;e Service he de&s;ign'd him; being well plea&s;ed that his Son &s;hould be educated after the manner of that Nation, and in the Court of &s;o great a Monarch. I al&s;o engag'd on the other &s;ide, that the very fir&s;t time I &s;hould come back to <HI>Guinee,</HI> I would not fail to put him in mind of his Promi&s;e, to the end that at my Return to <HI>France</HI> I might &s;et before the King the greate&s;t Pre&s;ent that could po&s;|&s;ibly be made; namely, the Son of Prince <HI>Thomas. Pray a&s;&s;ure him</HI> (&s;aid that Prince) <HI>that I am one of his particular Frineds, and that if he &s;tand in need, of my Service I will pa&s;s over into</HI> France, <HI>with all the Lances and Fu&s;ees belonging to the King my Father; that is to &s;ay, with all the Forces of the Kingdom.</HI> Then the King re&s;uming his Di&s;cour&s;e gave me to under&s;tand, that he al&s;o would take a Progre&s;s thither in Per&s;on, if it were requi|&s;ite, and immediately all the Negroes and Negre&s;&s;es made &s;o hideous an Out-cry, that I was extremely &s;urpriz'd: That Cry no
<PB N="31" REF="123">&s;ooner ceas'd, but the Fu&s;ileers di&s;charg'd a Volley of all their Fire-arms, the Trumpets &s;ounding, and Drums beating; and the Lance-men fell a running from one &s;ide to another backward and forward, with great Shouts; &s;o that I could not choo&s;e but be &s;omewhat frighted: And indeed, I did not know the meaning of that Uproar, neither was I able to recover my &s;elf, till I per|ceiv'd that the King drank a Health to the King of <HI>France</HI> a &s;econd time, with the &s;ome Ceremonies as before; that; Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> pledg'd his Father, and that 'twas order'd that we &s;hould all drink at the &s;ame time. Which being done accordingly, the King caus'd two Loaves of Wax to be brought to him, made me a Pre&s;ent of 'em, de&s;iring me to accept of 'em as a Mark of his Friend&s;hip, and afterwards enter'd his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Audience being thus concluded, Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> conducted me thro' all the Quarters of the Village, where he went to vi&s;it his Friends, and on the following Days we pa&s;s'd to divers other Villages, &s;ituated farther up the Country at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix Leagues one from another. The&s;e People, the greate&s;t part of whom never tra|vell'd to the Sea-&s;hoar, and con&s;equently never had a &s;ight of white Men, ran from all parts to &s;ee us, and brought us greater quantities of Fruit, and of Fle&s;h, of Buffles and Elephants, than we could eat. The E|lephants of that Country are not altogether like tho&s;e of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> being but of
<PB N="32" REF="124">one kind, as al&s;o are tho&s;e of <HI>Cofala,</HI> near <HI>Zanguebar,</HI> on the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;ts of <HI>Ethio|pia.</HI> The Negroes eat 'em with a great deal of Delight, and e&s;teem their Fle&s;h beyond any other: They make their mo&s;t &s;umptu|ous Fea&s;ts with 'em, and tho&s;e who were de|&s;irous to do us mo&s;t Honour, pre&s;ented 'em to us in&s;tead of Buffles; on which, never|thele&s;s I &s;et a greater Value.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much as they were not able to com|prehend the difference of Colour between our Complexion and theirs, they &s;troak'd our Faces with their Hands, to &s;ee whether the white Colour would pa&s;s away; nay, divers of our Company had their Hands &s;crap'd with Knives, &s;ometimes even till they were hurt, yet we dur&s;t not complain of that rough u&s;age: However, Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> perceiving it, commanded his At|tendants not to &s;uffer 'em thus to rub and &s;cratch our Fingers, and &s;poke aloud to the People that ran after us, telling 'em that all Foreigners were white, and that if the Ne|groes travell'd into other Countries, they would appear as &s;trange to tho&s;e Natives, as we did among them in <HI>Guinee.</HI> Nay, he of|ten &s;mil'd to &s;ee the Multitude continually running after us, as if we had been &s;ome un|known Animals; and I know not whether he were di&s;plea'd to &s;ee us thus pe&s;ter'd by the Importunity of the Negroes, or whether he might not take &s;ome Delight in ob&s;erving the Sotti&s;hne&s;s of tho&s;e People: And indeed, I had &s;ometimes an opportunity to take notice of all their extravagant Fopperies.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="124">
<P>At la&s;t, after three Days Journey, accom|pany'd with variety of Diverti&s;ements, the Prince convey'd me thro' another Road to take leave of his Father. The King care&s;s'd me in a mo&s;t obliging manner, according to the Cu&s;tom of his Nation, and made me promi&s;e to vi&s;it him the fir&s;t time I return'd to <HI>Guinee.</HI> Afterwards we embark'd in his Canoo, and arriv'd the next day at Prince <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Village, where he continu'd the no|ble Entertainments, with which he was wont to treat us. Then he told me that he was de&s;irous that I &s;hould perform the Office of a Godfather to his Son, and I comply'd &s;o much the more willingly, in regard that I had an Opportunity of contributing &s;ome|what to the making of a Chri&s;tian, and the &s;anctifying of a Soul.</P>
<P>But fora&s;much as I doubted whether the Prie&s;t of the Village knew how to baptize, or remember'd the Words that ought to be pronounc'd in the Admini&s;tration of that Sa|crament, I entreated the Prince to provide &s;ome of tho&s;e Prie&s;ts who were in the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, and he accordingly &s;ent for one to <HI>Cape de Lopez,</HI> who arriv'd two Days af|ter. The Chri&s;tian Religion was fir&s;t in|troduc'd into that Country by the <HI>Portugue|&s;es,</HI> altho' it be true indeed, that they do not maintain it therein as much as it is requi&s;ite: But the Ob&s;tacles that hinder the Propagati|on of it, proceed without doubt from the dif|ficulty of inhabiting an almo&s;t wild and bar|ren Country, where the Air and Provi&s;ions
<PB N="34" REF="125">are not natural to Foreigners: Therefore in order to its firm E&s;tabli&s;hment in tho&s;e Parts, 'twould be expedient for the <HI>Europe|ans</HI> to have &s;ettled Habitations, or to build Towns there, to in&s;truct the Negroes in the Articles of Faith, and My&s;teries of the Go&s;|pel, and to &s;end Mi&s;&s;ions thither from time to time; which might be done with great Facility, by rea&s;on that tho&s;e People are ex|tremely docil, and very capable of imbibing good Principles, and of embracing any Do|ctrine that one would go about to teach 'em, &s;ince they have liv'd for a long time without any manner of Belief, or any <HI>Idea</HI> of ano|ther Religion. The&s;e Negroes being thus converted to Chri&s;tianity, &s;ome of 'em might be ordain'd Prie&s;ts, who might be furni&s;h'd with Rituals, and other Books relating to the Ceremonies of the Church, and a Catechi&s;m for the regulating of their Faith, till they were capable of reading the New Te&s;ta|ment. It would al&s;o be requi&s;ite to e&s;tabli&s;h a Bi&s;hop in that Town, who &s;hould take care to &s;end Prie&s;ts into the &s;everal Habita|tions of the Negroes throughout the Coun|try, and to cau&s;e Oratories to be built in the mo&s;t populous Places.</P>
<P>Thus the Chri&s;tian Religion might be propagated in <HI>Guinee,</HI> and would be le&s;s lia|ble to be extirpated by the Wars that the Natives make with foreign People. A Re|formation might al&s;o be effectually carry'd on among the Chri&s;tians, who re&s;ide in the Kingdoms of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> and a mutu|al
<PB N="35" REF="125">Corre&s;pondence might be maintain'd be|tween the Prie&s;ts of that Nation, and tho&s;e of <HI>Guinee,</HI> to the end that they might a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in the Pre&s;ervation of Religion throughout all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa.</HI> Indeed Chri&s;tianity was planted almo&s;t after the &s;ame manner among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had a much greater Aver&s;ion to our Faith, than the Negroes of <HI>Guinee</HI> have at pre&s;ent. The Prie&s;ts, who are to be found thereabouts, are not for the mo&s;t part real Prie&s;ts; not having been ordain'd by any Bi&s;hop, and having only &s;ub&s;tituted them&s;elves in the room of tho&s;e who died in their Country: Neither have they retain'd any thing that &s;a|vours never &s;o little of Chri&s;tianity, altho' they perform may Ceremonies, and have &s;ome Appearance of the Admini&s;tration of the Sacraments.</P>
<P>But to return to our private Chri&s;tening; upon the Arrival of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Prie&s;t, Prince <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Son was actually Baptiz'd, and nam'd <HI>Lewis the Great,</HI> according to his Father's Intention: A certain Negre&s;s of his Relations &s;tood Godmother, and I my &s;elf was Godfather. I was told that that Lady bore the name of <HI>Antonia,</HI> which &s;he receiv'd from the Wife of a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Captain, who held her at the Bapti&s;mal Font. Two or three Days after the Celebration of this So|lemnity, which was perform'd with all the Magnificence that could be expected among the Negroes; &s;ome of prince <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Guards, who were po&s;ted, at <HI>Cape de Lopez,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="126">to give notice of the Arrival of the Ships, came to acquaint him with that of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el. Whereupon I entreated him to give me leave to embark therein, to return to my native Country, in order to my perfect Recovery from that illne&s;s, under which I &s;till labour'd. But he was not willing that I &s;hould put my &s;elf into the Hands of my Enemies; and de&s;ir'd me to have a little Patience, till the Arrival of &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> with whom he would readily permit me to go. However, he went to <HI>Cape de Lopez,</HI> to truck away Elephants Teeth, Wax, and Negroes, for Iron, Arms and Brandy, and return'd after ten or twelve Days, when he told me, that a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;el lay at An|chor at <HI>Cape de Lopez;</HI> that 'twas requi&s;ite to cau&s;e my &s;elf to be convey'd in Canoos, to embark there; that he had recommended me to the Captain; and that I &s;hould want nothing that was nece&s;&s;ary for me during my Voyage to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Then I took care to get all my Men to|gether, except two, whom I did not think fit to wait for, becau&s;e they had taken a Pro|gre&s;s into the Country for five or &s;ix Days, and I knew not where to find 'em. There|fore we embark'd in the Canoos of that Prince, after having &s;olemnly taken my leave of him; and being arriv'd at <HI>Cape de Lopez;</HI> I perceiv'd that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Com|mander was an old Acquaintance of mine, with whom I had contracted Friend&s;hip at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI> Whereupon I took
<PB N="37" REF="126">Ship with him, and three Days after, we ca&s;t Anchor before the &s;ame I&s;land; the Go|vernour of which &s;hew'd me a world of kind|ne&s;s, and did the like to all my Men, during a whole Month that we were oblig'd to &s;tay in that Port. At the expiration of that time, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship arriv'd, which had been &s;teering her Cour&s;e on the Golden Coa&s;ts. I &s;oon got into the Acquaintance of the Captain, and at la&s;t we became &s;o in|timate Friends, that I thought my &s;elf bound in Honour to accept of the kind Of|fers he made me, He entreated me to em|bark with him, and a&s;&s;ur'd me, that at <HI>Bar|badoes,</HI> to which place he was bound, I &s;hould meet with all the Supplies, nece&s;&s;ary for the recovering of my Health; becau&s;e there were certain able <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Phy&s;itians, who were his particular Friends. Therefore I went on board his Ship, with all my Men, notwith&s;tanding all the Rea&s;ons alledg'd by the Governour of the I&s;land, to induce me to &s;u&s;pect the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain, who was without doubt one of the mo&s;t courteous and upright Men of his Nation: He was &s;o kind as to re&s;ign his Cabbin to me, and to afford me all the Delights and Diverti&s;ements that can be imagin'd, to mitigate the Pains I en|dur'd from time to time.</P>
<P>Ten Days after our Departure from St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> having lo&s;t the Rudder of our Ship, we were oblig'd to &s;et up a Ma&s;t in its place, which was put thro' the Port-holes of the Gun-room, and we were forc'd to &s;teer
<PB N="38" REF="127">with it, during the whole time of our Voy|age, which continu'd three Months. When we &s;tood in for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> our Provi&s;ions be|gan to fail, and there only remain'd what was &s;ufficient for three Days, in&s;omuch, that the Captain being much offended at his be|ing overcharg'd with my Men, order'd three quarters of their Allowance to be retrench'd; and as &s;oon as we arriv'd in the Port, went to &s;alute <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> who was Governour of the I&s;land. He gave him a particular Ac|count of the Engagement I had with the Guard-Ship of <HI>Angola,</HI> and was very much blam'd for bringing me to <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> After|wards, returning to his Ship, he related to me every thing that was di&s;cours'd between him and the Governour, who forbid him un|der pain of Death, to &s;uffer me to land: However, he did not acquaint me with the Prohibition, but contented him&s;elf only to advi&s;e me not to go a-&s;hore, to avoid giving any cau&s;e of Su&s;picion to <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;ell,</HI> which Order I promis'd punctually to ob&s;erve, not being &s;ollicitous to take any further Cognizance of a Place, which was well known to me a long time ago, and being un|willing to give the lea&s;t Offence to my Cap|tain.</P>
<P>The next day, many <HI>Jews,</HI> who were turn'd out of <HI>Martinica,</HI> came to vi&s;it me up|on the Report of my Arrival; and perceiv|ing me to be very much indi&s;pos'd and weak|en'd, they &s;ent to me divers Phy&s;itians of their Nation, who told me that I could not
<PB N="39" REF="127">be cur'd, unle&s;s I were brought a-&s;hoar, proffering at the &s;ame time to &s;ollicite the Governour on my behalf, to give leave, that I might be convey'd into a Hou&s;e on the Port. Whereupon I drew up a Petition to <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> in which I entreated him to grant me &s;uch a Licen&s;e, promi&s;ing that I would not &s;tir out of the Chamber that &s;hould be appointed for my Lodging, only to re-em|bark, and to cau&s;e my &s;elf to be tran&s;ported to <HI>Martinica.</HI> However, the Phy&s;itians them|&s;elves were oblig'd to be my Bail, and I was at la&s;t conducted to the Hou&s;e of one <HI>M. Ja|cob Lewes,</HI> where great Care was taken of me during the whole time of my Abode in that Place.</P>
<P>Three Days after I was carry'd thither, the Major-General came to &s;ee me by the Go|vernor's Order; very generou&s;ly promis'd me his Protection, and offer'd his Service, e&s;pecially to procure me any thing that might be nece&s;&s;ary for the Re&s;tauration of my Health: Yet I was vi&s;ited from time to time by the &s;ame Major, and every day by a Captain of the Garri&s;on; who came not &s;o much to enquire after the State of my Health, as to ob&s;erve, whether I &s;hould ere long be in a condition to be tran&s;ported out of the I&s;land. <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;el</HI> him&s;elf came in like man|ner ten or twelve Days after my Arrival, to know whether it were true that I was really &s;o ill as it was reported: He al&s;o gave me a &s;econd Vi&s;it &s;even or eight Days after, in the Evening, and caus'd me to be remov'd
<PB N="40" REF="128">from the <HI>Jew</HI>'s Hou&s;e where I lodg'd, to that of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant: He told me at the &s;ame time, that I &s;hould be better ac|commodated there than I had been at <HI>M. Ja|cob Lewis</HI>'s; but the real Intention was, that I &s;hould be better guarded, and that I might not have an Opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing with &s;o many People. The next day he came a|gain to &s;ee me, and ask'd me how I lik'd my new Quarters. I heartily thank'd him for the good Offices he had done me, and to the end that he might not have cau&s;e to &s;u|&s;pect my Men, I entreated him to give Orders, that they &s;hould be confin'd in the Cittadel, to prevent them from &s;traggling about the I&s;land, and from making their E&s;cape.</P>
<P>Then <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;el</HI> told me, that he intended to do &s;o; but that I ought to under&s;tand that they were Pri&s;oners of War, as well as my &s;elf. I reply'd, That I was not ignorant of it; and that I thought my &s;elf happy in fal|ling into his Hands; but that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain, who brought me to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> had pa&s;s'd his Word that I &s;hould not be retain'd nor any of my Company: That upon his Prote&s;tations of inviolable Fidelity, and the Offers of Service he made me, I ventur'd to embark, relying on the marks of Friend&s;hip, which he had already &s;hewn: Then I ad|ded, that my Reque&s;t to him was only to grant me my Liberty, and that of my Men, promi&s;ing that I would ever be mindful of the Favour, either, in re&s;toring the Pri&s;oners whom I might carry off from the I&s;lands, if I
<PB N="41" REF="128">&s;hould take up Arms again, or in paying him what Ran&s;om he &s;hould think fit to re|qire.</P>
<P><HI>No, Sir,</HI> (&s;aid <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;ell</HI>) <HI>I will neither have your Ran&s;om, nor your Pri&s;oners; for you are &s;o gallant a Man, that your Misfortune and Ill|ne&s;s cannot but be pitied, and therefore on the contrary, I would entreat you to accept of Forty Pi&s;toles, of which I make you a Pre&s;ent, to &s;up|ply you with Nece&s;&s;aries.</HI> He gave 'em me in a Pur&s;e, which without doubt he brought for that very purpo&s;e, and at his Departure acquainted me that he was going to give Orders, that my Men &s;hould be got together again. The next day he &s;ent me two of 'em, who told me, that they did not know what was become of the re&s;t, and that they had Orders from the Governor to &s;tay with me: I had the Liberty to &s;end 'em abroad, to procure any thing that I &s;tood in need of, and at la&s;t finding my &s;elf &s;omewhat &s;trengthen'd by the means of the extraordinary Care that my Landlord took of me, I acquainted the Officer, who vi&s;ited me every day, that I would beg leave of the Governour to em|bark in the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el that &s;hould &s;et out from <HI>Martinica.</HI></P>
<P>Three Days after there arriv'd a Bark, which the Count <HI>de Blenac,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> I&s;lands, &s;ent for the exchanging of Pri&s;oners. <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;el</HI> gave me notice of its Arrival, and that I &s;hould prepare for my embarking therein. Then I had the Liber|ty to go to his Hou&s;e to thank him for all
<PB N="42" REF="129">the Kindne&s;&s;es he had &s;hewn me. He told me that he was &s;orry he was oblig'd by the Law of Arms not to allow me more Free|dom than I had, and that he entreated me to afford a favourable Entertainment to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men who &s;hould fall into my Hands. Afterwards I went on board the <HI>French</HI> Bark, which was commanded by the <HI>Sieur Courpon,</HI> formerly an Inhabitant of St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers;</HI> but I could not regain any of my Free-boot|ers, except tho&s;e two, who were &s;ent to me by <HI>M. Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> as I have already hinted.</P>
<P>We di&s;imbark'd at the Royal Fort of <HI>Martinica,</HI> and I repair'd with my two Men to the Town, to give a Vi&s;it to <HI>M. de Blenac,</HI> who was feiz'd with the la&s;t Fit of Sickne&s;s, of which he died. I gave him a particular Account of all my Adventures, and I per|ceiv'd him to be much &s;urpriz'd to hear a Relation of &s;o great Di&s;a&s;ters. Fora&s;much as he was de&s;irous that I &s;hould lodge in his Hou&s;e all the time that I &s;tay'd at <HI>Martinica,</HI> he made me every day repeat the particular Circum&s;tances of my Engagement with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship; and at la&s;t having found an Opportunity of conveying me to <HI>France,</HI> he &s;ent to enquire after the Captain of a Ve&s;&s;el that was bound for that Kingdom, and recommended me to his Care. He de|termin'd likewi&s;e to give me Recommenda|tory Letters for <HI>M. Phelipeanx,</HI> to procure me, &s;ome Employment; but the day before my departure, he fell into &s;o great weakne&s;s, that he was no longer in a condition to
<PB N="43" REF="129">write, and died that very Evening, <HI>June</HI> 10. Indeed I had all the rea&s;on in the World to be very much concern'd at his Death; for <HI>M. De Blenac,</HI> who was a Per&s;on of &s;in|gular Qualities, took delight in being &s;er|viceable to all Mankind; and more e&s;peci|ally had a tender Compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e that were in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition, or lay under the Pre&s;&s;ures of ill Fortune, as my Ca&s;e was at that time: He always endeavour'd to be beforehand with 'em, relieving 'em in their Nece&s;&s;ities, as &s;oon as they came to his Knowledge, and made a voluntary Proffer of the Favours he was ready to be&s;tow, even before they could well be &s;ued for. In a word, he was a Man of an Heroick Courage, and a skilful Navigator, well vers'd in Ma|ritim Affairs; knowing all the Coa&s;ts and Latitudes of the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and highly e&s;teem'd by the King for his Integri|ty, Je&s;tice and Prudence, and for all the &s;ignal Services he had done the State, in matters relating to Trade, and the di&s;cove|ry of the I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The next day after his Death, I went on Board the <HI>Virgin,</HI> a Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Bordeaux,</HI> which was al&s;o built there, and after a few Days Pa&s;&s;age; at la&s;t I arriv'd &s;afe in the Port of that City, with many different and contrary Sentiments. I know not whe|ther I &s;hall bid adieu to the Sea for ever, having been &s;o much di&s;hearten'd by my la&s;t Misfortune; or whether I &s;hall embark once again to revenge the Indignities put upon
<PB N="44" REF="130">me by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> or whether I &s;hall under|take another Voyage, to get a &s;mall E&s;tate; or whether I &s;hall &s;tay at home in Tranquil|lity, contenting my &s;elf with the peaceable Enjoyment of what my Relations have left me. However, 'tis certain, that Maritim Voyages are apt to create in Men almo&s;t the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions as Gaming: For as the lo&s;ing Game&s;ter, notwith&s;tanding the ill Luck he has &s;o often had before, does not believe that he &s;hall always be unfortunate, but is &s;till egg'd on by I know not what Impul&s;e to venture farther; &s;o we Mariners, whate|ver Di&s;a&s;ters may have befallen us at Sea, are continually boy'd up with the hopes of meeting with a fair opportunity to indem|nifie our &s;elves for all our Lo&s;&s;es. Upon the whole, I am apt to believe, that into who&s;e Hands &s;oever my Narrative may happen to fall, they will find it very difficult to give me Advi&s;e as to the Matter in Debate, and even to take it them&s;elves.</P>
