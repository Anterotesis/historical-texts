<P>The di&s;tractions in the&s;e parts begin to increa&s;e daily, and the coles of Enmity and Di&s;cord are now kindling again; for the adver&s;e party grow both nume|rous and potent, and the Lanca&s;hire Souldiery excee|ding in&s;olent and &s;tubborn, rejecting and di&s;obeying the orders of his Excellency, and refu&s;ing to disband;

<HEAD>A Me&s;sage from Holland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Prince is here yet, but his departure expected, and by many longed for: I cannot certainly in|forme you, whether it be into Scotland, or into Ire|land, he is expected at both. Sir <HI>George Radcliffe</HI> is &s;ent after Gen: <HI>Riven,</HI> to ha&s;ten the Swedi&s;h Army into their quarters: there are 6000 men at <HI>Necopia,</HI> ready to put to Sea, and 1200 at <HI>Lodu&s;ia,</HI> waiting only for the melting of the I&s;e: and the Duke of <HI>Hel&s;igna</HI> their Generall.</P>
<P>There is at Hamborough, waiting only for a wind, great &s;tore of Souldiers: 6000 Danes are rai&s;ing in Denmark, but upon what de&s;ign is not as yet knowne, there is another great Army rai&s;ing by the Zwitzers, wherein are many per&s;ons of great eminency, who command in chief, viz. &s;even Dukes, nine Marque&s;&s;es, &s;eventeen Earls, and two or three and twenty Lords. That of the Danes, two Dukes, &s;even Earles, three Marque&s;&s;es, and fifteene or &s;ixteen Lords. The&s;e are great numbers, and it is to be feared, will do more hurt to our already too poor Country, then they can do good. And yet we mu&s;t have very many more, as well of the barbarous Iri&s;h, as of the beggarly Scot, and the both proud and fooli&s;h French.</P>
<P>We heare certainly, the peace is concluded on in France: and by an expre&s;&s;e from P. <HI>Rupert,</HI> the Prince of Wales is a&s;&s;ured of a &s;trong Hold in Ireland; for the two Princes <HI>Rupert</HI> and <HI>Maurice,</HI> are at Sea with &s;eventy two Ships, and Frigots, and their Randezvouz the twelfth of March, are to be within nine Leagues of Dublin, at the Ca&s;tle of Burkley.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P> The &s;ixth of this in&s;tant, the Lord of Or|mond, Generall, the Lord of Clanrickard, Lieute|nant Generall; the Lord <HI>Ta&s;&s;e,</HI> Generall of the Hor&s;e, the Lord Muskerry, Commi&s;&s;ary; and Inchiquin; and Pre&s;ton, with five thou&s;and men, to meet <HI>Ormond</HI> and his fifteen thou&s;and, at Pitmere, twenty miles from Dublin.</P>
<P>Ile a&s;&s;ure you, this is the Princes intelligence: and if I could have got the Coppy of the Proclamation, &s;ent to the Lord of Ormond, you &s;hould have had it; But take the heads. Fir&s;t, he &s;hewes, that he hath no de&s;ire to commence his Reigne in bloud, and that he will freely pardon tho&s;e now holding any Ca&s;tle or Garri&s;on for the Parliament of England; That he fights only to &s;ettle him&s;elfe in the Throne of his late Father, and a deale to this purpo&s;e. This was &s;ent to the Lord of Ormond, by Collonell <HI>Buckworth,</HI> to be proclaimed as a Pardon to all tho&s;e that will fal&s;ify the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by the Parliament of Eng|land.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 17. of this in&s;tant, here arrived a Frigate, who upon her ca&s;ting anchor, immediately man|ned a long Boat to the &s;hore, the Mariners purporting that there hath been lately a great Fight at Sea between Captain <HI>Moulton</HI> and prince <HI>Rupert</HI> neer the We&s;tern point, and that after a bloudy fight, it plea&s;ed God to crown the &s;aid capt. <HI>Moulton</HI> with Victory, and to &s;ink two of the enemies &s;hips, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Leopard</HI> (formerly
<PB N="6" REF="5">called by the name of the <HI>Kings Royall Swallow</HI>) car|rying 40 pieees of Ordnance, and the <HI>Patrick</HI> of <HI>Ire|land</HI> carrying 24 This fight continued for the &s;pace of two hours, being with great gallantry di&s;puted by both parties; and after the exchange of &s;everal dread|full Vollies, the enemy perceiving two of their &s;hips bequeathing them&s;elves to the mercile&s;&s;e waves, held off, and with a fair gaile lanched forth into the Ocean: it is &s;aid the lo&s;&s;e is very great on both &s;ides, many be|ing &s;lain and wounded, yet the Mariners in the &s;aid Fri|gate make mention, that the lo&s;&s;e of the enemy doth far exceed ours, by rea&s;on of above 80 being drowned at the &s;inking of the afore&s;aid &s;hips. Captain <HI>Moultons</HI> Squadron con&s;i&s;ted of about twelve &s;hips, prince <HI>Ru|perts</HI> four and twenty. Some of ours are exceedingly torn and battered, but &s;ince repaired and mrde whole: its further intimated, that in this fight there were be|tween two and three hundred killed and wounded, the princes men begin to moulter away, and die apace, the bloudy fluxe, and other di&s;ea&s;es being very briefe a|mong&s;t them <HI>(a just judgment to all perfidious Chri&s;ti|ans)</HI> if the parliaments Summers Fleet be but expedi|ted to Sea, and timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;ent unto capt. <HI>Molton,</HI> no doubt, but he will be able to give a good accompt of this Summers Expedition. <HI>Oh! what a &s;ad thing it is, that a handfull &s;hould peri&s;h at Sea, when thou&s;ands may be &s;pared at Land.</HI></P>
