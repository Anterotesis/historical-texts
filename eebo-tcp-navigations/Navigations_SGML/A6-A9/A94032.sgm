<HEAD>The wonder of the World, <HI>Or the Great</HI> GYANT DESCRIBED.</HEAD>
<P>_THE &s;trange Report of this Mon&s;terous Huge <HI>Gyant</HI> hath filled all Ears with Wonder and Amazement; that &s;uch <HI>Men</HI> have been in former times, is undeni|able; but that &s;uch &s;hould be in the&s;e la&s;t <HI>Times</HI> of the World, might &s;eem not on|ly very inrredible, but al&s;o Wonderfull to the hearers or beholders of all &s;uch Mon&s;ters, as this is Reported to be; But before I come to de&s;cribe him, let me a little reflect upon former times, and of the Men of tho&s;e dayes, that the pre&s;ent <HI>relation</HI> we have in hand may gain the more likelyhood of truth.</P>
<P>That learned Author <HI>Varro,</HI> writeth of one <HI>Tritamio,</HI> a Fencer at <HI>Rome,</HI> of &s;uch exceeding &s;trength, that being bound hand and foot with ma&s;&s;ie Chains, he would wre&s;tle with the &s;tronge&s;t men that could be found, pu&s;hing their bodyes from one &s;ide to another, he giving &s;uch a deadly
<PB N="4" REF="3">blow, that if he but touched one of them, they were in great danger of their Lives; his Son was no whit inferior, for being a Souldier under <HI>Pompey,</HI> fought alwayes naked, armed with nothing but what <HI>Nature</HI> had furni&s;hed him withall, namely his <HI>Fie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Nayles,</HI> and if he touched but any one with his little finger, he made him yeeld, and brought him Pri&s;oner to the Campe; the <HI>Sinews</HI> of the&s;e two, were not onely at length like other men, but onely athwart, and cro&s;&s;e-wi&s;e over all their whole Body, from whence (as the <HI>Sages</HI> ob&s;erve) proceeded this their &s;o mi|raculous &s;trength.</P>
<P><HI>Elan</HI> writeth of a <HI>Gyant</HI> named <HI>Tritormo,</HI> of &s;uch mighty Pui&s;&s;ance and &s;trength, that <HI>Milo</HI> (another <HI>Gyant</HI>) thinking his great Fame would be ecclip&s;ed by the Report of the others &s;trength, and unconquered Valour; that <HI>Milo</HI> made no more adoe, but &s;ent him a <HI>Challenge,</HI> which was gladly accepted by <HI>Tritormo,</HI> and the Day appointed to Fight, the Combitants being no &s;ooner entred into Fight, But <HI>Tritormo</HI> catching up a mighty cleft of a huge <HI>Rock,</HI> which was impo&s;&s;ible for any Humane force to move, ca&s;ting it from him three or four times, with &s;uch exceeding force, and then lifting it up upon his Soulder, carried it &s;o farre, that <HI>Milo</HI> trembling and amazed at the &s;trangne&s;&s;e thereof, cryed out;</P>
<P><HI>Oh J&V;PITER! Is it po&s;&s;ible that thou ha&s;t brought another</HI> Hercules <HI>into the World?</HI></P>
<P>And &s;o declining the Ingagement, without more adoe, yeilded unto him; thinking it honor enough for him to wait upon him, and become his &s;ervant till his Death; the&s;e had both the Pipes of their Armes and Leggs doubled, their bones being whole, firm and &s;ound, either without hollowne&s;&s;e or <HI>Marrow,</HI> which cau&s;ed them to be of greater force and &s;trength; and which is mo&s;t Remarkable, They never &s;uffere Thir&s;t, nor at any time was it ever ob&s;erved that they &s;weat.</P>
<P><HI>Solinus</HI> writeth, that <HI>Hercules</HI> him&s;elf was but Seven <HI>Foot</HI> high, and all the re&s;t of his <HI>Body proportionable.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>He mentioneth al&s;o two <HI>Gyants</HI> that lived in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> the one named <HI>Pu&s;ton,</HI> the other <HI>Secundila,</HI> who were Ten <HI>foot</HI> high apiece; their <HI>bones</HI> are now to be &s;een in the <HI>O&s;&s;ary</HI> of the <HI>Salustians:</HI> Another <HI>Gyant</HI> was a|bout this time in <HI>Arabia,</HI> called <HI>Gauara,</HI> who was Nine <HI>foot</HI> and 9 <HI>Inches</HI> long, the re&s;t of his body proportionable. The <HI>Bones</HI> of <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> found at <HI>Tegoea,</HI> which being mea&s;ured, were found 7 Cubits long, which is more then four yeards. In the time that <HI>Sartorius</HI> remained Captain General over the <HI>Romane</HI> Army at <HI>Athens,</HI> he cau&s;ed the Sepulchre of a <HI>Gy|ant</HI> to be opened, and his bones to be mea&s;ured, the length of his Carca&s;&s;e was found to be 70 Cubits, which was &s;een to the great admiration of all the <HI>Romane</HI> Ho&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Bergamo</HI> writeth of a Sepulchre, wherein was found a Body of admirable greatne&s;s, outreaching as it were in length the high Walls or Buildings, he &s;eemed as if he lay &s;leeping, having wounds upon him Four <HI>Foot wide;</HI> at his <HI>Bol&s;ter</HI> &s;tood a <HI>Lampe</HI> burning, which would not go out till a <HI>hole</HI> was made in the <HI>Bottome</HI> thereof, which being done, it &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed; and the Body, &s;o &s;oon as touched turned into Powder and A&s;hes, about this Tombe was written in <HI>Greek</HI> Letters, <HI>Pallas, Son of Evander, &s;laine by Tur|nus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Bocacius</HI> writeth, That in the City of <HI>Trapana,</HI> cer|tain Labourers digging of <HI>Chalke</HI> at the foot of a Hill, di&s;|covered a <HI>Cave</HI> of wonderous widene&s;&s;e, in which was a <HI>Light burning,</HI> in the mid&s;t whereof &s;ate a man of Mon&s;ter|ous bigne&s;s, holding a Saffe as big as the greate&s;t Ma&s;t of a &s;hip; they being much affrighted with the fight, runne to the next Town amazed, and rai&s;ed all the People, who arming them&s;elves, came with <HI>Light Torches</HI> to the <HI>Cave,</HI> where finding he did not &s;tir, they laid hands on him, who &s;o &s;oon as touch'd fell into A&s;hes, the bones al&s;o remain|ing, which being mea&s;ured, his Carca&s;&s;e was found to be 140 Cubits long, his skull holding two heaped Bu&s;hells of <HI>Wheate.</HI> But the&s;e were all but <HI>Dwarfs</HI> to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Gyant;</HI> the true&s;t <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of him, take from that &s;age Philo&s;opher <HI>Democritus,</HI> who limmeth him forth thus.</P>

<P>This Mon&s;terous Gyant was taken by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant in a certain Iland in <HI>America</HI> called <HI>Nera,</HI> as two &s;hips were taking in <HI>fre&s;h-water,</HI> they &s;eeing this Mon&s;terous Gyant make towards them, with a great <HI>Oake</HI> in his hand, fled all to their &s;hallop or long-Boat, and &s;o made away to their Ship, much amazed at the &s;ight of &s;o mon&s;terous a Man; He &s;tanding &s;ome little time on the &s;hoar looking after them, and &s;o returned &s;ome di&s;tance up again into the I|land; Whereupon the Captain comanded 3 <HI>Butts</HI> of <HI>Sacke,</HI> and a Rundlet of <HI>Strong-Waters,</HI> to be placed on the &s;hoare, and &s;et an end, and the heads of them to be knock'd out, and &s;o to return a <HI>Ship-board</HI> againe, which done, the next Morning they perceived the Gyant come &s;talking down to the &s;hoare, and &s;melling the <HI>Sack,</HI> he took up a Butt as ea&s;i|ly as one would take up a Cup from the Table, and at one draught drunk it all off, and &s;o went to the next, and did the like, but at the third Butt he made two draughts, and &s;o falling down, &s;et the <HI>Strong-waters</HI> to his mouth, turning it up as ea&s;ily as one would do a <HI>Gill,</HI> which Strong-wa|ter &s;o intoxicated his head, That he fell into a dead &s;leep; whereupon the Captain &s;ent out a Shallop, with 30 of the lu&s;tie&s;t Marriners, with Chains to binde him, and &s;o with Cranes and Pullyes to get him into the Shallop, which with difficulty they effected, yet not without great dan|ger of &s;inking their &s;hallop with his extraordinary <HI>weight,</HI> having him at the Ship-&s;ide, opened the Decks, halled him up by Ropes and Pullyes, and &s;o <HI>loared</HI> him down into the <HI>Hole,</HI> where he &s;lept &s;weetly among the <HI>Sand</HI> 24 houres after, during which time, they had taken off his <HI>chains,</HI> and bound him hand and foot with new Ropes and Cables, and &s;o making fa&s;t the <HI>Balla&s;t-room</HI> left him lying along (as in a Coffin) all the length of the Ship; and &s;o, having a fair wind, &s;ailed about a hundred Leagues from the Iland be|fore he awaked, who perceiving him&s;elf intangled, &s;tretch|ing out his Limbs; cracked a&s;&s;under the <HI>Ropes,</HI> as ea&s;ily as one of us would doe a <HI>twine-thread,</HI> yet could not by rea&s;on of his length ri&s;e up; they feeding him through a
