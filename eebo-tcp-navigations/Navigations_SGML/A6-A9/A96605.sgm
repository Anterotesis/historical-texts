<P>_BEing convinced in his under&s;tanding of the ju&s;tne&s;&s;e of the Parliaments cau&s;e in oppo&s;ition to the King and his adherents, and de&s;iring to manife&s;t his affection thereunto. In <HI>Anno</HI> 1641. he at his owne charge fitted a Ship at <HI>Dover</HI> to be imployed in the &s;er|vice of the State again&s;t the Iri&s;h; but when he had ex|pended a very great part of his e&s;tate therein, Impre&s;t was denyed him, and he being a &s;tranger in tho&s;e parts, and not able to beare the whole charge) was forced to re|turne with the &s;aid Ship to <HI>Wales,</HI> there to Winter, and remaine untill Providence &s;hould offer an opportunity of his being &s;erviceable to the State, which fell according to his expectation; for immediatly after the Battle at <HI>Edge|hill,</HI> the late King &s;ent one Col: <HI>Donell</HI> to <HI>Swan&s;ey</HI> to &s;eize upon the &s;aid Ship, and in her to import Armes and Am|munition from <HI>France;</HI> but Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> having no|tice thereof, took his opportunity and &s;et &s;ayle with the &s;aid Ship to <HI>Plimouth</HI> immediately; for which he was proclaimed a Traytor to the King. But being &s;afely ar|rived, and having &s;upplyed the Town with &s;ome provi&s;i|ons, he took a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Earle of <HI>Stamford</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="4">then Generall of the We&s;t of <HI>England;</HI> and hearing the County of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was much &s;traitned, and in apparent danger of being lo&s;t to the enemy, the well-affected be|ing almo&s;t quite di&s;may'd, having very few friends, many irreconcileable enemies, and no one Ship of force belong|ing to the Parliament in their Harbour to &s;upport them, he &s;et &s;ayle to <HI>Milford haven:</HI> At who&s;e arrivall, the Par|liaments friends were much encouraged to defend them|&s;elves again&s;t the enemy, who were preparing to come a|gain&s;t them; and the enemy no le&s;&s;e di&s;couraged and de|ferred. From thence he &s;teered to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to Admirall <HI>Swanley,</HI> to whom he di&s;covered the nece&s;&s;ity of the Par|liaments friends in <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> with the advantage that might accrue to the Parl. intere&s;t, if he would with any of his Ships of War but appeare to countenance and en|courage them. Whereupon Admirall <HI>Swanley</HI> being &s;eri|ou&s;ly affected therewith, &s;ent Vice-Admirall <HI>Smith</HI> with Capt. <HI>Williams</HI> to <HI>Milford,</HI> where arriving they found two men of Warre of the Kings riding in the Harbour, &amp; threatning fire and &s;word to the Country, if they did not relinqui&s;h the Parl. intere&s;t, and adhere to the Kings; both which were taken, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Fellow&s;hip</HI> by Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> and the <HI>Hart</HI> Frigot by Capt: <HI>Williams,</HI> after 24. houres fight, to the great hazard of his own Ship.</P>
<P>Soone after he reduced the Town of <HI>Tinby</HI> to the obe|dience of the Parl. and obliged them to receive a Garri|&s;on from Maj: Gen: <HI>Laughorne,</HI> although the town at that time had onely Capt: <HI>Wyat</HI> and Capt: <HI>Gibs</HI> and their rela|tions that were in the &s;aid Town, friends to the Parl.</P>
<P>All which &s;ervices, expences and hazards were by him performed upon the &s;ingle &s;core of Affection, he having received no a&s;&s;urance of pay or &s;atisfaction from the Par. that might or did in any mea&s;ure induce him thereto.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<P>Neither re&s;ted he there; but with his Prize taken as a|fore&s;aid, &s;ayled to the Downes, where appearing to the Admirall and his &s;ervice by Vice-Admirall <HI>Smith</HI> to him manife&s;ted, the &s;ame was repre&s;ented to the Parliament, to who&s;e Officers he had delivered his Prize at <HI>Chattam,</HI> with all her &s;tores and tackle unimbezel'd, for which he received a publique owning from the Parliament, and was with his Ship entertained in the publique &s;ervice; and in a &s;hort time was in&s;trumentall in the bringing in many rich Prizes, which were di&s;po&s;ed for the &s;ervice of the Parl.</P>
<P>The next yeare having with the Parl. Commi&s;&s;ion put to Sea for his owne account, he was taken by three of the French Kings Men of War and carryed into <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> where his Ship was &s;old, and he him&s;elfe after many hard&s;hips and hazards e&s;caped with life to <HI>England,</HI> by which he was damnified in his e&s;tate, as is proved in the Admiralty, above 6000. l. all which lo&s;&s;es and hazards he &s;u&s;tained for no other cau&s;e but his con&s;tant adherence to, and ad|vancement of the intere&s;t of Parl. from whom as a reward and encouragement he received a promi&s;e of reparation.</P>
<P>Being di&s;abled in his e&s;tate as afore&s;aid, he re&s;olved ne|verthele&s;&s;e to engage againe according to his ability: In order to which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome friends, he built a Frigot with 32. Oares, with which he re-took the Scout Frigot formerly lo&s;t, &s;unk the Frigot called <HI>The Cavalier of Bri&s;toll,</HI> that infe&s;ted the We&s;tern coa&s;t, e&s;pe|cially <HI>Weymouth;</HI> al&s;o a Frigot of S. <HI>Mallowes,</HI> which con|tinually &s;upplyed the Kings party with Arms and Am|munition.</P>
<P>After which, and &s;everall other &s;ervices done for the Publique, he returned to <HI>London;</HI> where re&s;iding &s;ome &s;mall time, and finding the power of the enemy at Sea increa&s;ing, he againe ca&s;t him&s;elfe upon Providence, and
<PB N="4" REF="5">with three Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the Mermaid, the War&s;pite, and the Increa&s;e, fitted, victualled, and mann'd upon his own accompt he &s;et out to Sea; and being outward bound in <HI>Bolloign</HI> Roade, he tooke the <HI>Charles</HI> Frigot belonging to Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe,</HI> which had long infe&s;ted the Coa&s;t of <HI>Kent,</HI> and done much mi&s;chiefe to the Parlia|ments friends; which Frigot was al&s;o added to his Squa|dron, and a Commi&s;&s;ion obtained for her; &s;oon after, ranging in the Chanell he took the Princes Dogger|Boat, a ve&s;&s;ell of eight Gunns, laden with provi&s;ions for <HI>Pendennis</HI> fort, and a packquet directed to Sir <HI>Nicho|las Cri&s;pe;</HI> which being tran&s;mitted to the State, he &s;teered toward the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well to prevent &s;upplyes con&s;igned to the Iri&s;h from other Nations, as to make his purcha&s;e upon them. Where arriving, on the South We&s;t part of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Barnet Shillock,</HI> he im|mediatly landed &s;ome men, and forcing the Iri&s;h to re|tire to the mountains, he &s;eiz'd upon a Magazine of the enemies, con&s;i&s;ting of a good quantity of Powder, Match, Beere, <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> Salt Salmon, &amp;c. all which he carried on board without any lo&s;&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;i|tion of 120. Muskettiers lodg'd in an adjacent thicket, that endeavoured to prevent the &s;ame, the &s;aid <HI>Ambu&s;|cado</HI> being forced to retreat to a Village, from whence they were beaten al&s;o, and the Village Plundred, Burnt and de&s;troyed, together with the Magazine thereunto belonging; after which, he retired to his Ship without the lo&s;&s;e of any one man, &s;o great was the mercy of God in his pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>From hence he &s;ayled into the <HI>Bay</HI> of the <HI>Bantery,</HI> ha|ving a de&s;igne on the Town of <HI>Dingle de Couch,</HI> but un|der&s;tanding it had been newly &s;acked by Admirall <HI>Moul|ton,</HI> he went to Anchor in the &s;ound of the <HI>Blasketts,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5">where hareing that a Flemi&s;h Ship was that day gone into the &s;aid Town of <HI>Dingle,</HI> he pre&s;ently &s;ent the War&s;pite and the Increa&s;e, to attempt the bringing her out, which was accordingly performed with much gallantry by Captain <HI>Southwood,</HI> and Captain <HI>Falconer</HI> in de&s;pight of 500. &s;mall &s;hot that lined the banks, and endeavoured (but in vain) to Impede them.</P>
<P>With this prize (being the fir&s;t taken upon that Coa&s;t) he &s;teered to <HI>Kin&s;ale;</HI> where arriving, the Lord <HI>Broghill,</HI> then Commander in chiefe of the Parliament Forces in <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> being in great nece&s;&s;ity, u&s;ed &s;ome arguments to induce him to &s;ell part of the prize there for ready money, and to &s;upply him therewith, by which the Soldiers would be releeved, and he being thereby enabled to take the field, the intere&s;t of Parl. would be great|ly advanced, (with which he complyed) as not holding his own intere&s;t any way compatible, when the publick was in ballance, as an evidence whereof he &s;old all or the greate&s;t part of the be&s;t goods for ready money, &s;upply|ed him therewith, and received Bills charged upon the Parliament, upon which accompt there remaines to this day un&s;atisfied 3331.</P>
<P>The forementioned &s;ervices and evidences of his Faith and affection &s;o much to the knowledge of the Parlia|ment, by repre&s;entations from &s;everall places, &s;o far pre|vailed, that a Commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent him from the Com|mittee of the Admiralty, to be Commander in chief of the afore&s;aid Squadron, and all &s;uch other Ships as he could &s;et out, or procure to joyne with him, which Ships were to follow his directions; whereupon hearing that the enemy was fortifying in the I&s;le of <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> which being known to the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> al&s;o (who was newly arrived there) and perceiving the evill con&s;e|quence
<PB N="6" REF="6">thereof, &s;ent Cap: <HI>Williams</HI> a Commi&s;&s;ion to land thereon, with de&s;ire if po&s;&s;ible to force the enemy out, and to &s;ecure the &s;ame for the &s;ervice of the Parl. which he accordingly effected without the lo&s;&s;e of one man; the enemy being forc'd to &s;urrender upon quarter and promi&s;e of Tran&s;port to the maine Land, leaving all their Armes, Ammunition and Spoile behind them, which booty being mo&s;t in Cattle and valued at 250. l. was e|qually divided among&s;t the Marriners, Captain <HI>Williams</HI> disbur&s;ing the money, and retaining the Cattle there for the better &s;upport of the place.</P>
<P>Having reduc'd the &s;aid I&s;land as afore&s;aid, and took an exact view thereof, and finding the &s;ame (although of a &s;mall value) in re&s;pect of it &s;elf, yet very con&s;iderable to the State, as lying convenient to &s;ecure or prejudice the Southern and We&s;terne trade, he fir&s;t put in 35. able Seamen to &s;ecure the Ca&s;tle, who remained there|in untill he had procured it to be engarri&s;oned with a Lieutenant and 46. Soldiers of the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> Army, which were maintained at his own charge; &s;oon af|ter, he repayred the Ca&s;tle, and furni&s;hed it with &s;uitable provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, to his great expence, not doubting but when upon examination it &s;hould appear what preju|dice the Parliament would have &s;u&s;tained, had the ene|my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, he &s;hould have received an|&s;vverable &s;atisfaction for his &s;aid &s;ervices and expen|ces.</P>
<P>The I&s;land being &s;etled, he againe put to Sea, and took the Ship Cat of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> laden with Salt and Tobacco, of which he made a man of Warre, and added her to his Squadron, but ranging to and fro upon the Iri&s;h coa&s;t for &s;ecurity of that Channell, all the Parlia|ments Ships being called off, the winter growing on,
<PB N="7" REF="6">and having by &s;tre&s;&s;e of weather lo&s;t the <HI>Charls</HI> and In|crea&s;e Frigots, he with the Mermaid and War&s;pite returned for <HI>England,</HI> leaving the Cat on that Coa&s;t, who &s;oone after took in the River of <HI>Limbrick</HI> a con&s;ide|rable prize, but he him&s;elfe in <HI>England,</HI> they carryed her into <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> and imbezel'd mo&s;t of the goods, &s;o that little advantage accrewed thereby; In which &s;ervices &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, there is due to him for victualling, 620l. from the State, as may appeare by Bills &s;igned by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t &s;ervices many times receive the lea&s;t re|compence or re&s;pect, as may appeare by the &s;ub&s;equent part of this Narrative: for Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> his nece&s;&s;itated re&s;idence in <HI>England</HI> to procure from the Parl. the per|formance of their engagements to him, their non-pay|ment of the 333. l. due upon the Lo: <HI>Broghills</HI> Bills, nor the 620. l. due for victualling, as afore&s;aid, the charge of his Garri&s;on in Cape Cleere, his family and friends in <HI>England</HI> ruin'd by the Enemie, together with the vi&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity lay upon him to &s;upply the &s;aid Garri&s;on with men, in lieu of tho&s;e of the Lord <HI>Inchequeens,</HI> which were to march to their Regiment at <HI>Cork,</HI> reduced him to &s;o great a nece&s;sity (again&s;t which he could &s;ee no vi&s;ible po&s;sibility of obtaining reliefe from the Parl. or Com. of Safety in one ca&s;e or other) that he which but few mo|neths before was able and re&s;olved to &s;et forth to Sea, in the publique &s;ervice with four men of Warre, a Gally, and two Brigandines, was hereby &s;o di&s;enabled, that he was forced to &s;ell a Con&s;iderable part thereof, only re|&s;erving to him&s;elfe the Mermaid and the two Brigan|dines entire; which having effected, and knowing the time nigh expiring, wherein the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> men were to returne to their Regiment, and &s;eeing little like|lyhood
<PB N="8" REF="7">of gaining any thing from the Parliament or Com, of &s;afety, that might conduce to the &s;ea&s;onable and effectuall &s;ettlement of the &s;aid Garri&s;on and I&s;le, by rea&s;on of the daily encrea&s;e of new troubles; he was forced at his owne charge to &s;end his Brother, Captain <HI>John Williams</HI> into <HI>Wales</HI> to rai&s;e and tran&s;port 30. men to engarri&s;on the &s;aid I&s;land, and to furni&s;h them with all nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplyes that might enable them to &s;ecure the &s;ame, which work he &s;odainly effected, and arrived there in due time; the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> men being called off, and the charge thereof committed to him, im|mediatly whereupon the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> Revolted from his obedience to the Parliament.</P>
<P>By which meanes, to the forementioned troubles a new one was added, and that of a much greater concernment; for by this revolt of the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI>'s the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> was in danger to be lo&s;t, as to the Parlia|men. Whereupon waving all other concernments, hee addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elfe to the then Committee of Safety, and laid before them the con&s;ideration of the place, with all the advantages, that by the &s;ecurity thereof would accrew to the publique, but could obtaine nothing but a &s;ingle Order to enable him to take care thereof, and a promi&s;e of nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply, although to this day he never re|ceived any.</P>
<P>But being engaged to improve his utmo&s;t abilities, to pre&s;erve the &s;aid I&s;land, and finding no po&s;&s;ibility of ob|taining any recruit either of Men, Provi&s;ions, Armes, Ammunition or Cloaths; his own e&s;tate being nigh ru|ined, and the I&s;land no way able to re&s;i&s;t the power of the Enemy; he immediatly di&s;patched complementall letters to the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> to amu&s;e and divert him from de&s;igning or attempting any thing again&s;t the &s;ame.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<P>Immediatly whereupon, (having fir&s;t obtained a let|ter from the Committee of the Admiralty, to Captain <HI>Crowder</HI> Admirall of the Iri&s;h Seas, that he &s;hould con|tribute his utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;ecuring the &s;aid I&s;land) and having al&s;o with &s;ome difficulty obtained an Order from the Committee of the Navy for the payment of 400l. in cour&s;e from Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> then Trea&s;urer, as &s;atisfaction for the victualling of his two Ships, the Helena and Mermaid; but no ready money being to be had thereon he was nece&s;&s;itated to take up 200l. upon Bottomry, for which he paid 350l. as principall, and ad|venture for 8. months 100l. upon &s;pecialty in <HI>London,</HI> and 150l. in <HI>Bri&s;toll,</HI> &s;o great was his charge in victual|ling, and procuring 60. Seamen be&s;ides Soldiers, by him taken up to be employed in the &s;aid &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Being by the extraordinary appearance of God en|abled to pa&s;&s;e through all the&s;e difficulties, and out at Sea in the Mermayd, a dangerous combination was &s;et on foot by &s;ome ill-affected per&s;ons, officers in the &s;aid Ships, who de&s;igned to cary the Ships to <HI>Illford</HI> Sluce, where the revolted Ships then lay; but the &s;ame was through mercy di&s;covered and prevented, and the offenders &s;eized and &s;ecured in the Parliament Garri&s;on at <HI>Tenby</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI> From whence, as &s;oon as a &s;upply could be got, to an&s;wer the number of the forementioned Con|&s;pirators, he &s;et &s;ayle for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in few dayes ar|rived before the harbor of <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> where coming to an Anchor without command, he writ another letter to the Lord <HI>Inchequeen,</HI> therein intimating, that according to his former letters he was come upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with only one Ship; with which he was Commi&s;&s;ioned to take upon the Iri&s;h by the Parliament, which &s;ervice he was nece&s;&s;itated for 6. months to undertake as well to
<PB N="10" REF="8">repayre his fortunes ruined by the Iri&s;h, as to recover a co&s;iderable &s;umme of money due to him for for|mer &s;ervice; and therefore de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip to take no notice of him for that time, but command the delive|ry of a Brigantine by him built and remaining in harbour, and that he might have provi&s;ion for his money, for which favour he &s;hould remaine (&s;etting a&s;ide the afore|&s;aid nece&s;sity) his Lord&s;hips mo&s;t faithfull and obedient &s;ervant, &amp;c. With which Letter the Lord <HI>Inchequeen</HI> was &s;o fully &s;atisfied, that he not onely ordered the Go|vernour of <HI>Kin&s;alle,</HI> but all the other Engli&s;h Garri&s;ons, to let Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> have what he de&s;ired for his mo|ney; and his Brigantine was &s;ent out accordingly, with which he immediately &s;et &s;ayle to <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> where ar|riving, his Brother and Officers came aboard him, to whom he gave &s;uitable in&s;tructions how to manage their bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, competent &s;upplyes to enable them thereto, and exchange of Soldiers for feare of deficiencie or com|bination, together with an a&s;&s;urance of not onely frequent Vi&s;its, but Supplyes, as nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured the I&s;land, he &s;ayled toward the River of <HI>Limbrick,</HI> where hee took a &s;mall Prize, which in his returning to <HI>Cape Cleere</HI> was lo&s;t by foule weather. Soone after he met with a Dutch &s;hip laden with Mer|chants goods, and bound for <HI>Limbrick,</HI> which he re&s;olved to &s;ecure in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> but Providence ordered it otherwi&s;e, as by the &s;equel may appeare; and that di&s;pen fation which he thought to be of a de&s;tructive tendencie, proved the onely meanes of the pre&s;ervation of the &s;aid I&s;land.

<P>While this was on foot, Captain <HI>Pen</HI> came with the Non&s;uch Frigot into <HI>King&s;ale</HI> with the Lord <HI>Inchequeens</HI> elde&s;t Sonne, to whom he went privatly and acquainted him how affaires &s;tood with him, together with the rea&s;on of his being there, and by him to enform the Ad|mirall of his de&s;igne, with the knowledge whereof he could not tru&s;t any of his owne party.</P>
<P>But Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> his condition, not being publickly known, &s;ome Gentlemen carried from <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Mil|ford,</HI> reported at <HI>Tinby</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> that he was revolted with the Lord <HI>Inchequeen,</HI> whereupon a ketch by him taken formerly from a <HI>Wexford</HI> man, was &s;eized on for the u&s;e of the State, but his Brother together with Co|lonell <HI>Horton</HI> and Col: <HI>Jones,</HI> making an addre&s;&s;e unto the Admirall, who knew Capt <HI>Williams</HI> integrity, cau&s;ed her to be returned; in who&s;e cu&s;tody &s;he remained &s;e|verall

<P>But though it was his unhappine&s;&s;e to &s;uffer cau&s;ele&s;ly, his en&s;uing actions manife&s;ted that his affection was not re&s;ident with his body in <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> for he had no &s;ooner repayred his Ship, but he prepared to put to Sea, in which juncture of time, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with the Re|volted Fleet came thither; who by an Order in favour of the <HI>Limbrick</HI> Merchants, notwith&s;tanding <HI>Inchequeens</HI> engagement to the contrary) cau&s;ed his Goods to be &s;ei|zed; but afterwards by the procurement of the Lo: <HI>Inche|queen,</HI> they vvere againe freed; but with &s;o much regret on the part of the Princes Adherents, that he went not onely in great danger of his life, but was left without all vi&s;ible po&s;&s;ibility (without an extraordinary providence) either to get his Ship to <HI>England,</HI> or &s;ecure the I&s;land of <HI>Cape Cleere.</HI> Whereupon to e&s;cape their malice, and con|nivance to get his Ship into their Fleet, he de&s;igned her for a Voyage to the We&s;t Indies with Pa&s;&s;engers, which with much difficulty was effected, a Kin&s;man of his being tru&s;ted therewith; who at his returne was by him orde|red to touch at <HI>Cape Cleere.</HI> That de&s;igne being accom|pli&s;hed, he then ca&s;t about how to &s;ecure the &s;aid I&s;land untill the arrivall of the Engli&s;h Army, which he expect|ed in the Spring, and the return of the &s;aid Ship. In order to which end, (after he had &s;old the remains of his goods, and performed &s;uch formalities to the Prince and Lo: <HI>In|chequeen</HI> as his condition enforced) he betook him&s;elf to the I&s;land, where he remained, untill he received intima|tion of the lo&s;&s;e of his Ship and goods, to the value of

<P>At length with much importunity, he obtained two files of Muskettiers, and an Officer, as a Recruit on the States pay, which were continued only one month in the Garri&s;on, and then &s;ent for away, unle&s;&s;e Capt: <HI>Willi|ams</HI> would maintaine them at his owne charge; neither were they content with this, but by &s;ome underhand working with the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Revenue, pro|cured the I&s;land to be offered at a Rent to who would give mo&s;t: to colour which proceedings, a letter they &s;hewed C: <HI>Williams,</HI> as pretended to be &s;ent from the Lord Deputy <HI>Ireton,</HI> although it be evident by the purport thereof, if any &s;uch letter were &s;ent by the Lo: Deputy; it was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome letter fir&s;t writ to him, de&s;iring his direction therein, otherwi&s;e he would never have re|turned in an&s;wer; among&s;t &s;everall other things, that unle&s;&s;e they could prove Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> a Delinquent, it was but rea&s;on he &s;hould keep the I&s;land, paying a Rent, &amp;c. whereupon he &s;eeing the de&s;igne of his enemies was to take all po&s;&s;ible occa&s;ions to eject him, he &s;aw rea|&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity to countermine them, to which end he &s;ubmitted to a Rent, without Capitulation, whereupon 30l. <HI>per an.</HI> was impo&s;ed, and he enjoyned at his charge, to keepe Guard in the Ca&s;tle, which contract being ra|tified, he returned to the I&s;land.</P>
<P>But the enemy perceiving how he was &s;lighted, and that he was no way likely to receive any a&s;&s;i&s;tance or re|liefe from the adjacent Garri&s;ons, of which it is &s;uppo&s;ed they had intimation before hand, (as by the &s;equell if compared will appear probable) immediatly united as one man, contributing out of every family, upon an ex|pedition for re-taking the &s;aid I&s;land, as a place mo&s;t con|&s;iderable for their refuge under the conduct of <HI>Cornelius O Dri&s;coll,</HI> who was a per&s;on in quarter, but was made

<P>Soon after he received information that the enemy had appointed a Rendevouze at a place on the maine, two Leagues from the I&s;land, whereupon he a &s;econd time &s;ent out his Brother Captaine <HI>John Williams,</HI> with a &s;mall Skiffe manned, to the end he might fall in among them, to &s;poile their Boats, but the weather proving tur|bulent, he took onely three, which by rea&s;on of the foulne&s;&s;e of the weather, being di&s;enabled to bring them to <HI>Cape Gleere,</HI> he carryed and &s;ecured at the next Engli&s;h Garri&s;on; from whence he had foure Leagues to Row to <HI>Cape Cleere</HI> in foule weather, again&s;t the wind in a darke foggy night; but nece&s;&s;ities overcoming all difficulties, to Sea he put, and being with much hazard got almo&s;t home, he fell among the enemies Boats, who were viewing a place where they intended to attempt
<PB N="16" REF="11">Landing, but being di&s;covered by the enemy, a Contro|ver&s;ie aro&s;e between them whether it was an Engli&s;h Boat, or one of their owne Company; during which di&s;pute he made a &s;hift to get a &s;mall Rock betweene him and them, by which meanes he e&s;caped, and got him&s;elf and mo&s;t of his men &s;afe on &s;hore, and to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>But having no con&s;iderable &s;trength, could no way fur|ther impede their de&s;igne, or prevent their landing, but was con&s;trained to endure a &s;iege by 600. men, who im|mediatly made their approaches within Pi&s;toll &s;hot of the Ca&s;tle, where they rai&s;ed a Battery, planted their Ordnance, and &s;ent a &s;ummons to &s;urrender the Ca&s;tle upon good termes, but he denying to treat or &s;urrender, they fell to battering the Ca&s;tle, and &s;pending &s;mall &s;hot upon all places where they thought to annoy him, al|though to &s;mall purpo&s;e, whereupon in a dark night they attempted a &s;torme, but were repul&s;ed, with the lo&s;&s;e of 19. of their &s;toute&s;t men, which were left dead under the walls, without any lo&s;&s;e received by him in the &s;aid Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The enemy &s;eeing no probability of obtaining the Ca|&s;tle, onely continued their &s;iege five or &s;ix dayes, till they had carryed away all his cattle, and &s;tock in the I&s;land, to the value of 800. l. as it was by Oath proved by order of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Revenue. After which they marched away, and returned to their &s;everall homes, and were received into quarter upon promi&s;e to pay contribu|tion; his lo&s;&s;es and &s;ufferings being not deemed con&s;ider|able to be put in the ballance, that he &s;hould merit repaire from that enemy.</P>
<P>For returne of which favour, within a &s;hort time after that very enemy fell into Rebellion againe, and commit|ted many outrages. Whereupon the Lo: <HI>Broghill</HI> fell into their quarters, to whom the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Reve|nue
<PB N="17" REF="11">writ a Letter, de&s;iring him out of what prey he might or &s;hould take, to repaire Capt: <HI>Williams;</HI> but although he took all their Cattle, Capt: <HI>Williams</HI> could reap no bene|fit thereby, in re&s;pect a precedent Order was pretended to be made by the Commi&s;&s;ioners; whereby it was directed that all prey &s;hould be &s;old, and two thirds of the pro|venue paid into the Trea&s;ury, and the other to the party engaged in the action. In this manner, contrary to all for|mer pre&s;idents, (it being u&s;uall to repaire the Engli&s;h up|on the Baronies that prejudiced them) he was left without po&s;&s;ibility of reliefe for his dammage &s;u&s;tained by that Enemy.</P>
<P>And therefore the premi&s;&s;es being duly weighed, and a &s;erious con&s;ideration had both of his &s;ervices and &s;uffe|rings, it is very much hoped, That both your Excellency, and all per&s;ons of worth and authority, will be plea&s;ed to ca&s;t a favourable eye and re&s;pect towards him, and &s;peedily and effectually provide for his full reparation, and ju&s;t &s;atisfaction of what&s;oever &s;hall be made appeare to have been disbur&s;ed by him, or wherein &s;oever he hath been damnified in &s;ervice of the publick.

<P>By all which it may appeare, if duly examined, that by the pre&s;ervation of that I&s;le and Garri&s;on, he is damnified above 8000. l.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the lo&s;s of his employment at Sea, which if improved, might have rendered him capable of a more then ordinary relation; over and above the probable e|&s;tate that he might ju&s;tly have accumulated to him&s;elfe in his ordinary command as Captain.</P>
<P>But the forementioned lo&s;&s;es and accidents ari&s;ing thereupon, did reduce him to great nece&s;&s;ity, his charge being certain and great, his debts contracted upon him for &s;upport of the Garri&s;on, and other his relations nu|merous, and no vi&s;ible po&s;&s;ibility left him of repaying the one, or &s;upplying the other.</P>
<P>Whereupon &s;eeing his endevours at Land, &s;uted not to his de&s;ires, he re&s;olved as his la&s;t refuge to try his own proper element, the Sea; to which purpo&s;e he built him a &s;mall Frigot, which being man'd and fitted, he accor|dingly &s;et Sayle, and had &s;uddainly an opportunity of relieving two New-found Land &s;hips, the one of <HI>Poole</HI> the other of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> the &s;ame being taken by the <HI>French,</HI> both which were re&s;tored to their proper owners. To conclude, after &s;everall skirmi&s;hes, lo&s;&s;es, hard&s;hips and hazards, God was plea&s;ed as a returne of his prayers, and reward of his indu&s;try and patience, to give him an op|portunity to take upon the <HI>French,</HI> whereby he hath been enabled to pay a con&s;iderable part of his debts, and main|taine his relations during the time of his Petitioning the Parliament to take his Ca&s;e, Sufferings, Expences and Services into con&s;ideration; to the end the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Cape Cleere,</HI> never worth in times of peace above 100. l. <HI>per an.</HI> having been by him reduc'd &s;o many yeers &s;ince, and maintained at his charge, might in con&s;ideration of

In returne of which favour, if he had or could obtaine, (although his Arreares due for the keeping thereof, would according to the u&s;uall valuation have purcha&s;ed a much better e|&s;tate) it would create an exceeding obligation in point of gratitude upon him, and futurely devote him, his abilities, life and e&s;tate, faithfully to be imployed and improved for advancement of the publick intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But God which is the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;er of all things, hath &s;o ordered affaires, that his endeavours have been hither|to fruitle&s;&s;e; only he is kept up by a principle of depen|dance, nay confidence, that though one Generation be pa&s;&s;ed away, that might have beene in&s;trumentall in repayring not onely his breach, but the breaches of the Nation, yet that the time is at hand, wherein every man that hath with Faith, Affection and Fervour laid out him|&s;elfe and e&s;tate, for defence of the publique, &s;hall be an|&s;werably repayred, according to their &s;ervices and &s;uffe|rings; In a&s;&s;urance whereof, he hath (principles of rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity inducing) taken the boldne&s;&s;e to draw up and pre&s;ent unto &s;erious con&s;ideration this Narrative; In hope that when an opportunity &s;hall be offered, he a|mong&s;t many others may be remembred and repaired by the payment of his disbur&s;ements and arrears, or &s;ettle|ment of the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Cape Cleere</HI> upon him and his heires, as de&s;ired for &s;atisfaction thereof.</P>
