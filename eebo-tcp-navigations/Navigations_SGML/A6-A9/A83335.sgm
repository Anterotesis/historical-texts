<HEAD>AN ORDINANCE with &s;undry PROPOSITIONS OF THE Lords and Commons A&s;&s;embled in Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>_WHereas the greate&s;t part of this Kingdom, and more e&s;pecially the City of <HI>London</HI> and mo&s;t Maritine Towns are &s;erved and furni&s;hed with Coales from the Town of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tine,</HI> and the adjacent parts of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Durham,</HI> which being now kept by Forces con&s;i&s;t|ing of Papi&s;ts, and other ill affected per&s;ons, under the command of the Earle of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> the City of <HI>London</HI> and all the greate&s;t part of this Kingdome are like to &s;uffer very deeply in the want of that Commodity &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the maintainance and
<PB REF="3">&s;upport of life, and which is like to be of very dangerous con&s;e|quence in the influence which it may have upon the nece&s;&s;ities of the meaner &s;ort. And wheras it is al&s;o very dangerous to adventure &s;hipping within the command of the Forts there erected, as being &s;ubjected to a &s;urprize, and like enough to be made u&s;e of again&s;t the &s;afety of the kingdome, if they &s;hould make their voyage onely man'd as u&s;ually for trade; And how great u&s;e hath been made of the port of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to the danger of the kingdome, &s;ince it came into the hands of the &s;aid Earle is manife&s;t to all. It is therefore hoped that there are none that will be backward to contribute their be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the reducing of that place, in the recovery whereof all men are intere&s;&s;ed, and the rather for the opportunity that is now given, if it be &s;peedily undertaken, and effectually pro&s;ecuted. And whereas in obe|dience to an Order of the Hou&s;e of Commons the Committee of the Navy communicated their opinions in writing to the Lord Major of <HI>London</HI> by what meanes the &s;aid City may be furni&s;hed with Coales, with de&s;ire that his Lord&s;hip would impart the &s;ame to the Aldermen of that City, or &s;uch other per&s;ons as his Lord|&s;hip &s;hould thinke fit, which Writing with the Petition and Pro|po&s;itions of divers Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> were read at a Common-Councell, held at <HI>Guildhall</HI> in <HI>London</HI> &s;he twentieth of this moneth, where the &s;aid Court taking all the premi&s;es into their &s;erious con&s;ideration did conceive that this great worke might be effect|ed if both Hou&s;es of Parliament &s;hould thinke fit to approve of the&s;e en&s;uing Propo&s;itions. Wherefore the Lords and Commons in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, upon mature'd liberation had of the Propo&s;itions following, and well approving the good affections of the City of <HI>London</HI> to the publique &s;ervice, and of all &s;uch other well affected per&s;ons as &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe and pay in any con&s;ide|rable &s;umme of money according to the en&s;uing Propo&s;itions, for and towards this great and nece&s;&s;ary undertaking, doe Order and Ordaine in manner and forme following: And fir&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons doe con&s;ent to nominate ten of their owne Mem|bers, And the Lords and Commons doe order and ordaine, that
