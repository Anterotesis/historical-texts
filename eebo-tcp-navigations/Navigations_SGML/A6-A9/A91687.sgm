<HEAD>The Lord Admirals Letter to the Parliament.</HEAD>
<P><HI>VVHereas the Honorable Hou&s;es of Parliament have bin plea&s;ed to intrust me with the charge of the Fleet, I &s;hall therefore indeavour to improve that Authority committed to me, with a faithfull and inviolable re&s;pect unto my duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For, when I fir&s;t undertook this great charge, I was &s;en&s;ible how much the Cau&s;e, Truth, and Glory of God, the &s;ettlement of my Countries peace, and the preventing of the bloudy and de&s;perate de&s;igns of the Enemies thereof, depended upon the management of this expedition, and how much I was obliged in Con&s;cience and Honour to omit nothing that might have a tendency to tho&s;e ends. That obligation I have (according to my be&s;t rea&s;on and judgment) fathfully di&s;charged, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven have received this fruit (notwithstanding the many ob&s;tructions and difficulties that intervened) that the honour of the Parl. by Sea is cleared, the Fleet committed to my charge pre&s;erved in a condition of honour and &s;afety, the affections of the Seamen &s;etled, the de&s;ign of tho&s;e wicked Revolters, that per&s;idiou&s;ly betrayed &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the Kingdomes Navy broken, and &s;uch as a&s;sociated with them either rende|red or reduced.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as to the a&s;per&s;ion and pretended re&s;olution of my joy|ning with the Prince, in ca&s;e an agreement be not concluded of between the King and parliament, I do profe&s;se in the pre&s;ence of God, who knowes my heart and wayes, that it never entred into my thoughts, and that my &s;oul abhors it as incon&s;istent incon&s;istent with my Duty prejudiciall to the Parliament, de|&s;tructive to the Kingdoms peace, and unworthy of a free borne Engli&s;h man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And therefore, as I have hitherto been faithfull to the Kingdom,
<PB N="5" REF="4">and to the Parliament, where I have the honour to &s;it as a Peer, &s;o I do and &s;hall &s;corn to &s;acrifice my con&s;cience, &amp; tho&s;e ublike and dear concernments of my Countrey, wherein I have a portion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And while I have a heart, and a hand, I &s;hall not faile (by Gods a&s;&s;istance) to have them on all occa&s;ions, lifted up, for the &s;ervice of the parliament, and common intere&s;ts of</HI> England, <HI>with my uttermo&s;t integrity, and to my highe&s;t hazard.</HI></P>
