That all Iudges, Officers, Mini&s;ters, and Subjects of</HI> England, <HI>&s;hould be Ayding and A&s;&s;i&s;ting therein; and to take care that the &s;aid Letters Patents, and Commi&s;&s;ions thereupon, &s;hould be favourably interpreted, and con&s;trued in all re&s;pects, to the benefit and be&s;t advantage of Sir</HI> Edmond Turnor, <HI>and</HI> George Carew, <HI>their Executors, Admini&s;trators and A&s;&s;igns; as by an authentick Copy of the &s;aid Letters Patents hereunto annexed appears.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At the importunity of &s;everal Per&s;ons intere&s;&s;ed, in the &s;aid Letters Patents, for whom the &s;aid</HI> Turnor <HI>and</HI> Carew <HI>were nominated and intru&s;ted. An Exemplification of the &s;aid Ori|ginal grant; was delivered to one</HI> Captain Tyrence Birne, <HI>by the &s;aid</HI> George Carew <HI>to put the &s;ame in Execution, according to the force and effect thereof, again&s;t the</HI> States General <HI>and their Subjects. Whereupon the &s;aid</HI> Carew, <HI>only indor&s;ed an appointment upon the back &s;ide of the Exemplification in the&s;e words</HI> (viz) I the within named <HI>George Carew,</HI> do here|by con&s;titute, a&s;&s;ign, and appoint Captain <HI>Tyrence Birne,</HI> Commander of the good Ship the <HI>Royal;</HI> mentioning therein the burthen, number of Men, Guns, and time of victualling, to do, and Execute all and every &s;uch Act, and thing as by him the &s;aid <HI>Birne</HI> may be done, Exe|cuted and performed; by virtue of the &s;aid Letters Patents, In witne&s;s whereof, the &s;aid <HI>Carew</HI> &s;et his Hand and Seal. <HI>The &s;aid</HI> Captain Birne, <HI>promi&s;ing to procure Sir</HI> Edmond Turnor <HI>to &s;ign the &s;ame, which the &s;aid</HI> Birne <HI>neglected to do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In pur&s;uance of the &s;aid &s;ingle appointment,</HI> Captain Birne <HI>pirocured</HI> Jonathan Fro&s;t, <HI>and other his part-owners, to &s;et forth the &s;aid Ship to Sea; and con&s;equently in or about the Month of</HI> Augu&s;t 1666. <HI>near</HI> Portland Bay, <HI>He &s;eized a Fly-boat, laden with Wine, Salt,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>lately named the</HI> Godlive <HI>of</HI> Brugis, <HI>coming from</HI> France, <HI>and bound for</HI> Am&s;terdam; <HI>and carried the &s;aid Fly-boat into the Harbour of</HI> Chiche&s;ter, <HI>from whence he &s;ent to Mr.</HI> Suckling <HI>his Proctor for a Commi&s;&s;ion to examine the Ma&s;ter and the Seamen, who confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be</HI> Hollanders <HI>born, the Ship</HI> Dutch <HI>built, and the goods cou&s;igned to</HI> Dutch-men. <HI>Then upon return of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion from the chief Magi&s;trates of</HI> Chiche&s;ter; <HI>the Iudge of the Admiralty, pronounced that there was good cau&s;e of &s;eizure, and condemned the pretended claimers in the expences; But in regard one</HI> Peter Gerrard <HI>claimed the Ship and Goods, for the accompt of</HI> Jacob Neitz, <HI>and others, Burgers and Inhabitants of</HI> Brugis <HI>in</HI> Flanders; <HI>an Order of Court was made (the Goods being peri&s;hable,) that both Ship and Goods &s;hould be re&s;tored, upon Bail to abide the Sentence, upon hearing the cau&s;e; which the Claymer re|fu&s;ed to give, pretending, that before the Ship was taken into the Vice-Admiralls cu&s;tody, or Wayters of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e put upon her; that much Salt, Wine, and Saffron, was im|beazelled. Whereupon they Arre&s;ted</HI> Captain Birne, <HI>by Writ out of the Admiralty for</HI> 1000 l. <HI>damages, and committed him to the</HI> Mar&s;hall&s;ey, <HI>who gave good and &s;ufficient Bail by two Citizens of</HI> London, <HI>to an&s;wer the &s;aid Action.</HI></P>
<PB REF="2">
<P><HI>Afterwards the Ship and Goods, upon pretended Certificates from</HI> Brugis; <HI>and new examina|tions, were re&s;tored by decree of the Court, and confirmed by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Prizes; and actually delivered accordingly. Then Mr.</HI> Francklin <HI>Proctor for the pretended Claimers, Exhibited a Libel again&s;t Sir</HI> Edmond Turnor, George Carew, Captain Birne, <HI>and</HI> Jonathan Fro&s;t, <HI>without any di&s;continuance, or pro&s;ecution of the Action for</HI> 1000 l. <HI>again&s;t</HI> Birne, <HI>And framed an impertinent Sentence again&s;t Sir</HI> Edmond Turnor <HI>and</HI> George Carew <HI>(who were not Arre&s;ted, Cited, or Summoned to defend the &s;aid Cau&s;e)</HI> Tyrence Birne, <HI>and</HI> Jona|than Fro&s;t, <HI>for eighteen hundred pounds damages, through imbeazilments leakage and &s;poiling the Ship and Goods by lying, (although occa&s;&s;oned by the wilfull default of the pretended owners) wherefore Sir</HI> Edmond Turnor <HI>and</HI> George Carew, <HI>appealed by them&s;elves for a Nullity of the &s;aid Sentence as repugnant to Law, and of a dangerous con&s;equence to the Sub|jects of</HI> England, <HI>if &s;uch practices &s;hould be brought into pre&s;ident.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That one</HI> Peter Victorine <HI>a per&s;on born in</HI> Am&s;terdam <HI>appeared for the pretended Clamers (after</HI> Peter Gerrard <HI>run away to avoid payment of the expences, and the charges of the Sea|men at</HI> Chiche&s;ter, <HI>which are yet un&s;atisfied) and continues in his malicious and vexatious pro&s;ecutions again&s;t</HI> Turnor <HI>and</HI> Carew, <HI>notwith&s;tanding there is not upon their own &s;hew|ing, any the lea&s;t proof again&s;t the &s;aid</HI> Turnor <HI>and</HI> Carew <HI>in all their Examinations, (though of no Record, to make them chargeable or guilty of any imbeazilment, or &s;o much as the know|ledge of any of the &s;aid tran&s;actions mentioned in the &s;aid Sentence, from which they ap|pealed to His Maje&s;ty in the High Court of Chancery, who appointed the &s;ame to be heard, and determined by the Right Honourable the Lord Chief Iu&s;tice</HI> Rainsford, <HI>Iudge</HI> Wild, <HI>Iudge</HI> Windam, <HI>Faron</HI> Littleton, <HI>Sir</HI> Richard Loyde, <HI>Sir</HI> Timothy Baldwin, <HI>Sir</HI> Edward Lowe, <HI>Dr.</HI> Pinfold, <HI>Dr.</HI> Trumball, <HI>Dr.</HI> Digby, <HI>Dr. and</HI> Briggs, <HI>or a competent number of them, as by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion unto them directed, under the great Seal of</HI> England <HI>appears.</HI></P>

<P>And in the following Articles of the &s;aid pretended Libell, it's alledged that <HI>Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> and <HI>Carew</HI> ratified, allowed and confirmed the &s;eizure of the Ship <HI>Godilive</HI> of <HI>Brugis,</HI> and her Lading, and the di&s;po&s;al of the Goods taken out by <HI>Birne,</HI> and others, And the damnifying the re&s;t of the Goods by lying; in regard, <HI>Fro&s;t</HI> and <HI>Birne</HI> proceeded to adjudication in the Admiralty, in the names of <HI>Sir Edmond Turnor</HI> and <HI>George Carew.</HI> Although neither of them, the &s;aid <HI>Turnor</HI> and <HI>Carew</HI> gave any &s;uch Order; or did at any time lay out any Money, or promi&s;e by way of contribution towards the pro&s;ecution thereof, for any Fees or Salaries to Ad|vocates, Proctors, or Regi&s;ters, who were imployed in the &s;aid Proce&s;s before Sentence; neither are any of the&s;e things made out in the proofs tran&s;mitted, <HI>pro ut, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. It is again&s;t the rules of all Ju&s;tice, that any man &s;hould be condemned before he be heard; and how <HI>Sir Edmond Turnor</HI> and <HI>George Carew</HI> &s;hould make their defence upon any Action, or Libell again&s;t them, being not Arre&s;ted or Legally cited, or &s;ummoned to &s;ee &s;uch Libell admitted again&s;t them. Wherefore, &s;uch an Action, Proceedings and Sentence upon it, is void and null to all intents and purpo&s;es of the Law,</P>
<P N="5">5. It appears upon the pretended claimer's own &s;hewing throughout their whole Proce&s;s tran&s;mitted, wherein &s;o much Paper is &s;poiled, that the greate&s;t damages were occa&s;ioned by delay of proceedings after the Capture; for which the &s;aid Claimers were condemned <HI>in expen&s;is retardati proce&s;sus,</HI> at the in&s;tance of <HI>Birne</HI> and <HI>Fro&s;t,</HI> that only Pro&s;ecuted in the names of <HI>Turnor</HI> and <HI>Carew.</HI> And it al&s;o appears in the proofs that the Embeazelments were done by particular per&s;ons in the Ports, Havens, and Rivers of <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> within the Bodies of the Counties of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Dorcet,</HI> and ought to be tryed there according to the Common Laws and Statutes of <HI>England,</HI> by matter of Record; and tho&s;e per|&s;ons to be que&s;tioned only (by Action of <HI>Trover,</HI> or by <HI>Information</HI>) that did the wrong; there cannot be any pre&s;ident found, that ever any Admiral, Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Peace, or any other Officer, or Mini&s;ter what&s;oever, who was neither <HI>particeps Criminis nec Muneris,</HI> was que&s;tioned for any thing done contrary to a Legal War|rant and Authority given or granted out by either of them; but that only the party offending was called to que&s;tion for exceeding his Commi&s;&s;ion, or Authority.</P>

<P>The &s;eizure was adjudged Legal, upon &s;everal circum&s;tances in the Ca&s;e, the damages afterwards was through the default of the pretended Claimers: And the embeazilments being done by &s;everal per&s;ons within the bodies of the County of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Dorcet,</HI> where the municipal Law of <HI>England,</HI> and not the Civil Law hath the Juri&s;diction.
