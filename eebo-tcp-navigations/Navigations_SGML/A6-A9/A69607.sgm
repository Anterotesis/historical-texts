<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Two following <HI>Let|ters,</HI>
which I have here
pre&s;ented to the Reader,
being lately come to my hands, and
containing a &s;hort but mo&s;t exact
and authentick Account of the pre|&s;ent
Condition of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Empire, I thought I could &s;carce
do more acceptable piece of Ser|vice
to the Publick at this Juncture,
than to communicate them to the
Curious. The fir&s;t Letter was writ|ten
by a Gentleman, who being at
<HI>Am&s;teldam</HI> at the time of that So|lemn
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Emba&s;&s;y; and
whil&s;t the <HI>Czar</HI> was there pre&s;ent,
had the Honour to be intimately
<PB REF="3">
acquainted with &s;ome of the <HI>Mu&s;|vites</HI>
of the fir&s;t Rank there, which
gave him the opportunity to be in|form'd
concerning the&s;e Matters,
which hitherto either are
not at all, or at lea&s;t, but very con|fu&s;edly
come to our Knowledge.
Tho&s;e who will &s;eriou&s;ly reflect
upon what this Gentleman has been
plea&s;ed to tell us concerning the
two. Sieges of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> its true Situ|ation,
Advantage and Strength;
concerning the pre&s;ent State of the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Navy, and their Mari|tim
Affairs; with &s;everal other
mo&s;t Curious Ob&s;ervations, relate|ing
to his <HI>Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty's</HI> Per&s;on,
e&s;pecially &s;ince his departure out of
<HI>England,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, agree with
me in Opinion, that this Account
is the mo&s;t exact, and perhaps al&s;o
the mos;t authentick we have had
of this kind for many Years before.
The &s;econd being an Ab&s;tract of
&s;everal Letters written by a Per&s;on
of Quality then Re&s;iding at the
Imperial Court at <HI>Vienna,</HI> gives us
<PB REF="3">
a faithful Account both of his own
Sentiments and of the whole Imperial
Court concerning the pre&s;ent State of
Affairs in <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> with very Cu|rious
Ob&s;ervations upon &s;everal re|markable
Subjects, relating to the
la&s;t Peace with the <HI>Turks;</HI> and the
Way by Land through the <HI>Great-Tartary</HI>
into <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Any one that will be at the
pains to compare the Maps the
Geographers have been plea&s;ed to
put upon the World formerly, of
the North Ea&s;tern Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
with this Account, will &s;oon be
convinced of their Ignorance, when
they have repre&s;ented this Part of
the World, which is Stock'd with
va&s;t Numbers of Inhabitants, and
Water'd by &s;o many great and fair
Rivers, as inhabitable Forre&s;ts and
De&s;arts. In the whole, the&s;e two
Letters may well be con&s;ider'd as a
Supplement of the <HI>Antient and Pre|&s;ent
State of</HI> Mu&s;covy, publi&s;hed
at the time of His Czari&s;h Maje|&s;ty's
being in <HI>England;</HI> many things
<PB REF="4">
of Moment which have happened
&s;ince, being in&s;erted here, and re|lated
upon the Credit of tho&s;e
Per&s;ons, who had the opportunity
of taking the be&s;t Information that
can be expected of this kind. I
will not pretend to enlarge much
upon the Hi&s;torical Portraicture,
given us by Father <HI>Bouvet,</HI> of the
pre&s;ent Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> &s;up|po&s;ing
that his being an Eye-wit|ne&s;s
of what he relates, and his
offering it to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
King, will be a &s;ufficient Plea, both
for his Authority and Veracity, to
the unbya&s;s'd Reader.</P>

<P>ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</P>
<P>WHen I con&s;ider the Genius
of the Age we live in,
which is &s;o much inclined to call in
que&s;tion every thing that comes
from far Remote Places, I have all
the Rea&s;on in the World, to fear
that the&s;e Memories will undergo the
&s;ame Fate and will not meet with
that favourable interpretation, the
faithfulne&s;s and exactne&s;s where|with
they are written, might ju&s;t|ly
Challenge from unqualified Per|&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
But as I have not in&s;erted the
lea&s;t thing, of which I have not
either been an Eye-witne&s;s my &s;elf,
or el&s;e have received it my &s;elf from
unque&s;tionable hands, &s;o I am apt
to flatter my &s;elf, that the Reader
will look upon this Relation with
another Eye, than is commonly
done upon ordinary accounts; I
hope no body will think me &s;o Im|pudent,
as to dare to Pre&s;ent to the
mo&s;t quick-&s;ighted and greate&s;t Mo|narch
of the World, any thing
which is not in all its circum&s;tan|ces,
agreeable to Truth; which
mu&s;t heeds bring upon me the ju&s;t
Indignation of His Maje&s;ty, and
at the &s;ame time, be a means to
forfeit the Good Opinion of
the Greate&s;t Emperour of the
<HI>Orient.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever the Spirit of Con|tradiction
may be able to invent, to
render the&s;e Memoirs &s;u&s;pected to
the World. I don't que&s;tion, but that
Truth which is repre&s;ented here
without Contradiction, in its Genu|ine
<PB REF="5">
Shape, will protect me both
here and in <HI>China</HI> again&s;t all gain|&s;ayers;
the only thing which I have
to relent at, being, that I have not
been able to repre&s;ent in their full
Lu&s;tre all &s;uch Matters, as mu&s;t
needs be infinitely plea&s;ing to all,
who are truly Zealous for the pro|pagation
of the Faith.</P>

in</HI> France, <HI>that is to &s;ay, a Prince,

it may be truly &s;aid of him, that he

CONDITION
OF THE

TILL THE
YEAR 1699,
In a LETTER from a Gen|tleman,
who was Conver&s;ant
with the late Mu&s;covite Am|ba&s;&s;adours
in Holland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your la&s;t you de&s;ired me to acquaint
you with what I had been able to learn
concerning the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Mu&s;co|vy,</HI>
during the Stay of that mo&s;t &s;olemn
Emba&s;&s;y of His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty in this Ci|ty.
I am extreamly well plea&s;ed, you have
put me in the way of &s;atisfying in &s;ome
<PB N="2" REF="9">
mea&s;ure your Curio&s;ity, having by the fre|quent
Conver&s;ation with the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;a|dours,
had the opportunity to inform my
&s;elf of &s;everal Matters of great Con&s;e|quence,
not commonly known in the&s;e
Parts. I cannot but be amaz'd at the
&s;trange. Notions the greate&s;t Part have
form'd to them&s;elves of the pre&s;ent Con|dition
of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> being prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd
with an Opinion, that this Monarchy is of
&s;o little Consequence in re&s;pect of the other
<HI>European</HI> Kingdoms, as &s;carce to be worthy
taking notice of.</P>
<P>But whoever will take the trouble to
make a true in&s;ight into the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture
of their Affairs, will be forced to confe&s;s,
that there are few Kingdoms in <HI>Europe,</HI>
which at this time may be look'd upon as a
more proper Object of our Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It is not to be denied, but that before the
Year 1645, when Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovitz,</HI>
(his pre&s;ent <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Father) came
to the Crown, the <HI>Ma&s;covites</HI> were much
more barbarous, that they cultivated but a
very &s;lender Corre&s;pondence, and had but
little Commerce with foreign Nations; and
that being ill vers'd in all manner of Sci|ences,
they were con&s;equently very igno|rant
of the Military Art and Di&s;cipline, at
lea&s;t as it is practi&s;ed now a-days in <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
which was the true Rea&s;on of their
ill Succe&s;s in &s;o many Encounters, and that,
tho' naturally fierce and hardy, they were
frequently wor&s;ted by their Enemies, tho'
much interior in Number.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">
The Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovitz,</HI> a Prince
of a va&s;t Under&s;tanding, and a Great Po|litician,
having immediately after his Ac|ce&s;&s;ion
to the Throne, inve&s;tigated the true
Cau&s;e of the Di&s;advantage, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
lay under at that time, in re&s;pect of other
foreign Nations, applied all his Thoughts
to remove this Ob&s;tacle; The be&s;t Expe|dient
he could pitch upon, was, to draw in|to
his Service as many foreign Officers as
po&s;&s;ibly he could, to in&s;truct his Subjects in
the Modern Art of War; And the better
to compa&s;s his De&s;ign, he made u&s;e of all
the Politicks that could have been invented
by the mo&s;t refined Politician. For being
&s;en&s;ible, that it would be no ea&s;ie Task to
engage a con&s;iderable Number of well qua|lified
foreign Officers into his Service, he
in&s;en&s;ibly brought them over to his Party,
by the Promi&s;es of great Pay, of entire
Liberty of Con&s;cience, of what Religion
&s;oever; and by taking them into his Ser|vice
but for a little time: all which was ve|ry
punctually ob&s;erved on his &s;ide. Thus
he put his projected De&s;ign in execution,
with &s;o extraordinary Succe&s;s, that accord|ing
to the Account given by the Baron of
<HI>Meyerbergh,</HI> who was in the Year 1662,
&s;ent by his pre&s;ent Imperial Maje&s;ty <HI>Leo|pald,</HI>
as his Amba&s;&s;adour into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
there were among the foreign Officers in
the Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovitz</HI>'s Service, two
Generals, two Mar&s;hals de Camp, above a
hundred Collonels, a great Nnmber of Ma|jors;
Captains, Lieutenants and En&s;igns, in
<PB N="4" REF="10">
prodigious Numbers, who were all paid
very punctually: This Account coming
from a Per&s;on, who otherwi&s;e &s;eldom &s;peaks
well of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and their Affairs,
de&s;erves to be particularly taken notice of
in this place.</P>
<P>The&s;e abovementioned Officers, having
made their Levies in divers parts of the
Country, &s;ubject-to the Obedience of the
Czars of <HI>Mu&s;chovy,</HI> and brought them under a
regular Martial Di&s;ciplines, did afterwards
in &s;everal Encounters with the <HI>Poles</HI> and
<HI>Swedes,</HI> give &s;ufficient Proofs, that the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> don't want Bravery, when
they are led on by good and experienc'd
Officers. But, be&s;ides the&s;e new Levies, the
Czar had always on foot a certain &s;tanding
Number of old Troops, not unlike to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Legions; tho&s;e the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> call
<HI>Strelitzes,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of forty Thou&s;and
Men, under the Command of the Chiefe&s;t
of the Nobility of the Empire.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved, that the in|troducing
of a more regular Di&s;cipline a|mong
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Forces, was not the
only Rea&s;on which induc'd the Czar <HI>Alexis
Michaelovitz,</HI> to entertain &s;o va&s;t a Num|ber
of foreign Officers in his Service, it
having been prov'd by Experience, That
the &s;ame was in a great mea&s;ure, founded
upon the Security of the Prince's Per&s;on,
who before that time, having committed
the whole Management of their &s;tanding
Forces to the Nobility, thereby gave them
frequent opportunies of abu&s;ing their Pow|er
<PB N="5" REF="10">
in oppo&s;ition to the Royal Authority.</P>
<P>This Great Prince died in the Year 1676,
much lamented by his People, who&s;e Dar|ling
he was, as having not once, in all his
Reign, in the lea&s;t abu&s;ed his Ab&s;olute Pow|er,
but given them a thou&s;and Demon&s;tra|tions
of his Moderation, Ju&s;tice and Pie|ty.
It was he, that fir&s;t changed the face of
Affairs of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire, and laid
that Foundation, upon which the
Greatne&s;s of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> has been built
&s;ince that time, and which is likely to be
brought to perfection, by the pre&s;ent Grand
Czar Peter <HI>Alexiovitz.</HI></P>
<P>He left the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown to
his elde&s;tt Son, <HI>Fedor Alexiovitz,</HI> who reign|ed
but &s;ix years, his early Lo&s;s was like|wi&s;e
much lamented by his Subjects, being
a very Accompli&s;h'd Per&s;on, and who had
given extraordinary hopes of a Good and
Great Prince, having exactly followed his
Father's foot&s;teps, especially in what con|cerns
the foreign Officers, and the Encou|ragement
of Commerce. He was a great
lover of all Sciences, but e&s;pecially of the
Mathematicks, and de&s;ign'd to have all
the Hou&s;es of the City of <HI>Mu&s;con,</HI> new
built of Brick, and the Streets pav'd with
Stones, if he had not been prevented by
Death; It was under his Reign, that Ge|neral
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> of whom I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion
to &s;peak more anon, entred into the
Service of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> He was on a &s;udden, &s;eiz'd
by a violent and continual Feaver, of which
he died in a few days afte; having before
<PB N="6" REF="11">
his death appointed his younger Brother
<HI>Peter,</HI> begotten by &s;econd Adventure, his
Succe&s;&s;our, as judging his own Brother
<HI>Ivan (John)</HI> who was of a weakly Con&s;ti|tution,
uncapable of bearing the Burthen
of &s;o Great an Empire.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>Peter Alexiovitz</HI> was pro|claimed
Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> when he was
&s;carce eleven years of Age. By the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Sophia,</HI> Daughter of the decea&s;ed Czar
<HI>Alexis Michaelovitz,</HI> by his fir&s;t Marriage,
being of a very a&s;pirng Temper, and na|turally
di&s;po&s;ed to Caballing, could not
brook to &s;ee her own Brother excluded from
the Succe&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Throne; for
which Rea&s;on, &s;he &s;et all her Engines at
work, to put the Crown upon her Brother
<HI>Ivan Alexiovitz,</HI> or rather, her own Head.
The better to encompa&s;s this De&s;ign, &s;he
took care to have it &s;pread abroad, that the
late Czar <HI>Fedor Alexiovitz,</HI> her Brother, had
been poy&s;oned by the Phy&s;icians, at the
In&s;tigation of &s;ome of the Chief Men of
the Empire, who&s;e Names were indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
publi&s;hed as the Anchors and Pro|moters
of &s;o helli&s;h a Crime. Being &s;en|&s;ible
that nothing could &s;trengthen her In|tere&s;t
more, than if &s;he, could draw the
<HI>Strelitzes</HI> into her Party; it was rumour'd
abroad, That a De&s;ign was form'd
again&s;t them at Court, it being re&s;olved,
That the Strong Liquor which was to be
given at die Czar's Funeral, &s;hould
be mix'd with Poy&s;on.</P>

<P>Our Geographers do mo&s;t commonly fix
the &s;cituation of <HI>A&s;oph</HI> to the North of the Ri|ver
<HI>Tanais</HI> on the &s;ide of the <HI>Crim Tartary,</HI>
whereas its true &s;cituation is to the <HI>South,</HI> on
the &s;ide of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> upon a ri&s;ing ground ve|ry
near the <HI>Palus Moetis.</HI> Neither is this
City built upon an I&s;land, as it is repre&s;ented
in &s;ome Maps, neither are any other I&s;lands
to be &s;een thereabouts, either near the
mouth of the River, or in the <HI>Palus Moetis</HI>
it &s;elf, as it is likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e
Maps, unle&s;s it be one very &s;mall I&s;le
which lies at the very mouth of the River
<HI>Tanais</HI> (now a-days called the <HI>Don</HI>) to|wards
the North-we&s;t, very near the
Coa&s;tt.</P>
<P>About two Leagues above this Fortre&s;s,
the River <HI>Tanais</HI> emits a branch which
runs towards the North, in the form of
<PB N="12" REF="14">
a Semy-circle before it enters the <HI>Palus
Moetis,</HI> but it is both very narrow and &s;hal|low.
A good way, beyond this, a little above
the Town, i&s;&s;ues forth another Branch,
which ruuning likewi&s;e to the North in
the form, approaching, to a Semy-circle,
divides it &s;elf into five other Branches, ju&s;t
before it di&s;embogues into the Sea. But
this Branch is al&s;o of a very &s;lender depth,

which drives the Waters from the black

lies under Water.</P>
<P>You will, I &s;uppo&s;e, be not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
when I tell you, that the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
in their Maps put <HI>A&s;oph</HI> under the
47th degree of Northern Latitude, and &s;o
do likewi&s;e the <HI>Turks;</HI> whereas in our
Map; we find it under the 51 degree, or
thereabouts. But, what de&s;erves our par|ticular
ob&s;ervation is, That, our Maps a|gree
exactly with theirs in the &s;cituation
of that part of the Country where the <HI>Ta|nais</HI>
or <HI>Don,</HI> approaches neare&s;t to the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI> which both they and we put under
the 49th Degree. I can only thus much
a&s;&s;ure you, that, the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who are
generally taken for very ignorant and unpo|li&s;h'd,
have compo&s;ed the mo&s;t exacte&s;t
Maps of their own Country in the World, I
having &s;een &s;ome of them my &s;elf; and that
<PB N="13" REF="14">
they exclaim again&s;t ours, as very imper|fect
in this point.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>A&s;oph</HI> was formerly no more
than a &s;mall Place, fortified only with
one &s;ingle Wall, after a very irregular
manner; its Form approaching to a <HI>Hexa|gon,</HI>
two of its oppo&s;ite &s;ides lying near pa|rallel
with the River, &s;urrounded with ma|ny
Towers, after the ancient Fa&s;hion. A|bout
the middle of that &s;ide which is oppo|&s;ite
to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> there was a very large
Tower of a con&s;iderable heighth, round at
the bottom, running up like a Pyramid, but
flat on the top; within the body of the
Place there was another Retrenchment,
which &s;upplied the place of a Cittadel, and
was provided always with a good Garri&s;on.
The <HI>Turks</HI> afterwards &s;urrounded the whole
with new Fortifications of Earth, compos'd
of our large and high Ba&s;tions, but not very
regular, yet is the Ditch both very broad and
deep. Two of the&s;e Ba&s;tions towards the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI>
Side lie pretty clo&s;e to one another,
for the better defence of the place, in re|&s;pect
of the nearne&s;s of &s;everal Hills, which
el&s;e would command the Town. The third
Ba&s;tion to the <HI>South-We&s;t,</HI> is at a great di|&s;tance
from the other two, and the fourth
Ba&s;tion towards the <HI>We&s;t</HI> is yet further di|&s;tant
from the third. The Courtin betwixt
the&s;t two la&s;t Ba&s;tions has in the mid&s;t an
Obtu&s;e. Angle; the like has al&s;o the Courtin
towards the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> which, runs down to the
River; and on the River &s;ide it is very
well provided with &s;trong Palli&s;adoes.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
Be&s;ides this, they had built a little above the
Place two &s;trong Towers of brick-work, and
of a quadrangular figure, one on each &s;ide
of the River, provided with good &s;tore of
Cannon, by which means, and a very &s;trong
Chain, they prevented the <HI>Donaick Co&s;acks</HI>
from pa&s;&s;ing that way to the black Sea, who
formerly u&s;ed to take the advantage of the
darkne&s;s of the Night, when they went a
Pyrating upon, the <HI>Turks.</HI> This was the
condition of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> when the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
fir&s;t laid &s;iege to it, in the Year 1695.</P>
<P>It may well &s;eem &s;trange, that the <HI>Turks</HI>
&s;hould either &s;o little under&s;tand the ad|vantage
of the Scituation of this Important
Place, or el&s;e be &s;o negligent in providing for
its Security, as not to take away all Hopes
from the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> of &s;ucceeding in this
Enterpri&s;e. In my Opinion, it was not
only their highe&s;t Intere&s;t to have &s;ecured
a Place of &s;o much Con&s;equence again&s;t
any Attempt of this nature, by rendring it
Impregnable, but al&s;o to have as much as
po&s;&s;ibly they could, extend their Conque&s;ts
on that &s;ide, by making them&s;elves Ma&s;ters
of the Country betwixt the Rivers <HI>Don</HI>
and <HI>Wolga,</HI> which thereabouts approach
within &s;even Leagues di&s;tance to one ano|ther.
Be&s;ides which, there are two other
Rivers betwixt the <HI>Don</HI> and the <HI>Wolga,</HI> one
of which coming from the <HI>North Ea&s;t,</HI>
is pretty large, and di&s;charges it &s;elf into
the River <HI>Don.</HI> The other much le&s;&s;er co|ming
from the <HI>South We&s;t,</HI> di&s;embogues into
the <HI>Wolga.</HI> The&s;e two Rivers carry their
<PB N="15" REF="15">
Currents within one League and an half
di&s;tance. The&s;e two Rivers, are invi&s;ible
in our. Maps, in lieu of which they have
obtruded upon us a &s;uppo&s;itious River, called
<HI>Camus,</HI> which is not to be found therea|bouts.
The Ground betwixt the&s;e two
Rivers is very convenient for Building of
Forts and Fortifications, there being but a
few &s;mall Rocks, which may be made
pa&s;&s;able, and convenient enough for &s;uch
an Undertaking.</P>
<P>The Turks &s;hewed them&s;elves but indiffe|rent
Politicians, and who had but a &s;lender
in&s;ight in matters of this nature, when
they let &s;lip &s;o favourable an Opportunity
of extending their Conque&s;ts on that &s;ide
during the Inte&s;tine Troubles, which har|ra&s;&s;ed,
and almo&s;t de&s;troyed the <HI>Mu&s;|tovite</HI>
Empire in our Age, at the &s;ame
time that the <HI>Ottomans</HI> were in a mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing
Condition. If they at that time had
joined the&s;e two Rivers by a Canal, and
&s;trengthened the &s;ame with &s;ome Forts; or
if they had built but one con&s;iderable Fortre&s;s
upon the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> the whole Kingdom
of <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have fall'n into
their Hands, by which means it would have
been no difficult task for them to render
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Lake, or
Sea, which is the Inlett into the Heart of
<HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and at no great di&s;tance from the
<HI>Indies,</HI> Subject to the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and for
the re&s;t it is &s;urrounded by a great number of
Petty <HI>Tartarian</HI> Princes, who might either
have been ea&s;ily Conquered, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="16">
brought over to their Party to make
them instrumental in the Conque&s;t of
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> What would in &s;uch a Ca&s;e have
become, of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who would
have been continually allarm'd, and
harra&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides by an infinite
number of <HI>Tartars,</HI> by tho&s;e of the <HI>Cri|mea,</HI>
of <HI>Circa&s;&s;a, Bulgaria,</HI> by the <HI>Calmuck</HI>

would have over-run this va&s;t Empire, and
would have rendred the Conque&s;t of all the
Circumjacent Countries as cheap and ea&s;ie
to the <HI>Turks,</HI> as the&s;e Vagabonds formerly
did, when they took up Arms under tho&s;e
Renown'd Heroes, <HI>Ginghis Khan,</HI> and <HI>Ta|mur
Lenek.</HI></P>
<P>These, are two things which pre|vented
the <HI>Turks</HI> from making u&s;e of that
critical Juncture to their Advantage. The
fir&s;t was, that they look'd upon the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI>
as too incon&s;iderable to &s;tand ever
in Competition with them, &s;eeing they had
not Courage enough to accept of the For|tre&s;s

Con&s;equence and u&s;e of a good Naval
Strength, by which means they might

<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
The <HI>Turks</HI> had provided the City of

and Provi&s;ion, and all other things ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for a long and vigorous Defence,
the Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of ten Thou&s;and

<P>Whil&s;t they were bu&s;y in per&s;ecting the

<P>But the Di&s;grace received before <HI>A&s;oph,</HI>
was in &s;ome mea&s;ure recompen&s;ed by the
Conque&s;t of <HI>Ka&s;iker meen,</HI> a <HI>Tartarian</HI> City
Scituated on the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide of the River
<HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> about two Leagues di&s;tance
from the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>It is encompa&s;&s;ed by four &s;trong brick
Forts of a quadrangular Figure, and an e|qual
bigne&s;s, adjoining to one another.
Three of them lye upon a &s;trait Line, but
the Fourth makes up a right Angle with
the Second. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Quadrangu|lar
Forts lies upon the very Bank of the
River <HI>Bori&s;henes,</HI> being Flancked with
&s;everal good Towers as well as the two o|thers,
which are upon the &s;ame Line. But
the fourth exceeds the three others in
Strength, being on one &s;ide provided, in|&s;tead
of Towers, with two large, and high
Ba&s;tions, &s;urrounded with a good Ditch.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the place you &s;ee a
&s;mall I&s;land in the River <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> re|&s;embling
<PB N="20" REF="18">
in form, a Neats Tongue, called
in their Language <HI>Towan.</HI> Upon this I&s;land
the <HI>Tartars</HI> had erected two Forts of four
Ba&s;tions each, which on the upper end of
the I&s;land was called <HI>Momberethkermenn;</HI>
as the other on the lower part was named
<HI>Muftritkermeen;</HI> on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the
River belonging to the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI> there
was al&s;o another Fort in all re&s;pects like to
the other two, ju&s;t over again&s;t <HI>Momba|rethkermeen,</HI>
upon the Bank of the before
mentioned River <HI>Bori&s;thenes.</HI></P>
<P>The Army of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was
chiefly compos'd of <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> inhabiting
tho&s;e parts, and who &s;ome years before had
&s;ubmitted to the <HI>Czar's</HI> Obedience. To
facilitate the Siege of <HI>Ka&s;ikermeen,</HI> it was
re&s;olv'd to Attack fir&s;t the &s;aid Forts, which
being done, accordingly they were &s;oon ta|ken
by the brave <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> who imme|diately
after laid Siege to the Place it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The train Attack was carried on again&s;t
the Fort with the two ba&s;tions, the Ground
thereabouts being mo&s;t proper for the car|rying
on of the Trenches, which were ad|vanc'd
with &s;o much Expedition, that in
a &s;hort time they carried in by A&s;&s;ault. The
Enemies however got time to retreat into
the other Forts, where having beat a Par|ley,
it was agreed that they &s;hould March
out of the Place with their Arms and Bag|gage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="18">
The <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army on that &s;ide was
commanded by the General <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI>
who having contrary to the Capitulation,
connived at &s;ome di&s;orders committed by
the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> again&s;t the Garri&s;on; his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty was &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfied at it, that
he &s;hewed his Re&s;entment in very hard
Terms to the General. He, who did not
expect &s;uch a Reprimand, de&s;ired thereup|on
leave from the <HI>Czar</HI> to lay down his
Commi&s;&s;ion, which being readily granted
him likewi&s;e beyond his expectation, he, after|wards
repented atlei&s;ure. The better to divert
him&s;elf in this Melancholly Di&s;po&s;ition, he
re&s;olved to Travel in Forreign Countries,
and you are not ignorant, how he vi&s;it|ed
mo&s;t of the Courts of <HI>Italy,</HI> and had the
Curio&s;ity to go to the I&s;le of <HI>Maltha,</HI>
where, as well as in all other Pla|ces,
thro which he Travelled, he was re|ceiv'd
with all imaginable Re&s;pect due to
his Birth and Merits.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding Winter was chiefly ta|ken
up with va&s;t Preparations for the next
en&s;uing Campaign, which being to be o|pened
with the Siege of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> great &s;tores
of Ammunition, Bombs, and Provi&s;ions
were got in readine&s;s for that Enterpri&s;e
to prevent the <HI>Turks</HI> from &s;ending any
Relief by Sea; many Gallies and Brigan|tines
were order'd to be built near the City of
<HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> but e&s;pecilly at <HI>Veranowitz,</HI> a City
Scituate on the River. <HI>Don,</HI> about a Hundred
Leagues di&s;tant from the Capital City. But
what is mo&s;t remarkable is that the <HI>Czar Pe|ter</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="19">
having a particular curio&s;ity to be pre|&s;ent
at the building of &s;ome of the bigge&s;t
Gallies, he cau&s;ed them to be &s;et upon the
Stock, in the River <HI>Ocea,</HI> at &s;ome &s;mall
di&s;tance from the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> they
being from thence to be Tran&s;ported to
<HI>Veranowitz,</HI> by Land, were &s;o artifici|ally
contrived, that they might be taken
to pieces without much trouble, and &s;o be
joined together again at <HI>Veranomitz.</HI></P>
<P>To be &s;hort, by the great Vigilancy of
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, all things were got
in &s;uch forwardne&s;s, that there was no|thing
wanting to put the projected De&s;ign
in Execution.</P>
<P>'Tis to be ob&s;erv'd that the City of <HI>A&s;oph</HI>
had been kept block'd up during the
whole Winter, and that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
having maintain'd their Po&s;t all this while
upon the abovementioned Hills, which o|verlook
the Place, they had been &s;o In|du&s;trious
in guarding all the Avenues, that
the Be&s;ieged had not receiv'd the lea&s;t Sup|ply
of Men, or Provi&s;ions. To cut off all
further hopes of Succours, it was re&s;olved
to open the Campaign very early in the
Spring, for which purpo&s;e all the Troops
de&s;ign'd for this Expedition, were order'd
to March to their Rendezvous, and from
thence &s;trait to the Siege of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> which
was begun by throwing a mo&s;t prodigious
quantity of Bombs into the place, with
&s;uch extraordinary Succe&s;s, that the whole
Body of the city was reduced to A&s;hes,
and Rubbi&s;h, and the old Fortifications to
<PB N="23" REF="19">
one large Stone heap, &s;o that there was
&s;carce a place left for the Garri&s;on to &s;hel|ter
them&s;elves again&s;t the fury of the Ene|mies
Cannon and Bombs, all being de|&s;troyed
even to the deepe&s;t Vaults and
Caves.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides which, the Number of the be|&s;ieged
was reduced to le&s;s than two thou|&s;and
Men capable of bearing of Arms,
both by the furious Attacks made upon
the place in the la&s;t years Siege, and the
continual firing from the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> Great
Artillery, and throwing in of Bombs; in
this; not with&s;tanding which, they were
deaf to any propo&s;als of a &s;urrender,
living in hopes of the promi&s;ed Succours.</P>
<P>At la&s;t it appeared, to their great Joy
and Satisfaction, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve Gal|lies,
a great number of Saiques laden with
Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, and a good
number of fre&s;h Troops, be&s;ides fifty thou|&s;and
Ducats, to be di&s;tributed among tho&s;e
brave Fellows that had &s;o Valiantly de|fended
their Po&s;t.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty having before-hand
received Intelligence of the approach of
this Succours, had cau&s;ed &s;even of his
large&s;t Gallies, of a hundred foot length
each, be&s;ides &s;everal le&s;&s;er, and a great
number of Brigantines to pa&s;s that &s;mall
branch of the <HI>Don,</HI> which i&s;&s;ues forth a lit|tle
above the Town As the Water is ve|ry
&s;hallow in this Channel, &s;o it was not
without a great deal of difficulty, that the
large&s;t Gallies could be brought along that
<PB N="24" REF="20">
way, and would in all likelihood have
&s;carce &s;ucceeded, if the <HI>Czar</HI> by his Pre|&s;ence
and Encouragement had not anima|ted
the Workmen to &s;urpa&s;s all Difficulties,
which at la&s;t they did, to the no &s;mall A|&s;toni&s;hment
of the be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;tacle being happily &s;urrnounted,
his Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty judged it of very great
con&s;equence for his purpo&s;e to plant good
Store of Cannon upon the little I&s;land we
have mentioned before, becau&s;e the Shoar
being very low, the Cannon-ball would
&s;trike even with the &s;urface of the Water;
be&s;ides, that the greate&s;t part of the I&s;le
being covered with Wood, did prevent the
Enemy from di&s;covering the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The &s;ame favourable di&s;po&s;ition of this
I&s;land furni&s;hed the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> with an
Opportunity of putting &s;ome of their
lighte&s;t Gallies and Brigantines for a Re|&s;erve,
behind the I&s;le, unperceiv'd by the
Enemy, whom, they intended thus to at|tack
both in Front and Flank, as they pa&s;|&s;ed
by that way, which &s;ucceeded accord|ing
to Expectation.</P>
<P>For, all the&s;e Precautions having been
taken before the Enemies Fleet came in
&s;ight, &s;ome of the bigge&s;t <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Gal|lies,
with many Brigantines were &s;ent out
to meet them, making a Show, as if they
intended to Engage the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet;
but no &s;ooner were they come within Can|non
Shot of one another, but the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
feigning to dread the <HI>Ottomaa</HI> Fleet,
&s;uperior in Number to them, made a run|ning
<PB N="25" REF="20">
Fight, making the be&s;t of their way
towards the Shoar, and po&s;ted them&s;elves
below the I&s;land. The <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving
the Enemy to fly before them, and not in
the lea&s;t forewarn'd of the red that laid
behind the I&s;land, thought them&s;elves, by
the &s;mall number of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Gal|lies,
that appear'd in &s;ight, a&s;&s;ur'd of the
Victory.</P>
<P>Flu&s;h'd with the&s;e hopes, they made all
the Sail they could to fall in among the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> but no &s;ooner were they come
within reach of the Cannon from the I&s;le,
but they receiv'd &s;uch a warm Salute from
thence, that they &s;aw their Gallies torn to
pieces on all &s;ides by the Enemies Cannon,
in an in&s;ant, with a great Slaughter of
many of their Men. Bur this was
only the fore-runner of what was to
en&s;ue.</P>
<P>For his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, who had a
watchful eye on all &s;ides, and who was
&s;ometimes upon the I&s;le, &s;ometimes on
board the Fleet of Re&s;erve, that lay be|hind,
having &s;oon ob&s;erved the Con&s;terna|tion
the <HI>Turks</HI> were put in by this unex|pected
Salute, and willing to improve their
Confu&s;ion to his Advantage, got on board
in Per&s;on one of the lighte&s;t Gallies, Man'd
only with forty Men, giving the Signal
for the re&s;t to follow him with all the Oars
they could. Thus the Enemy found them|&s;elves
&s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI>
who attack'd them with great bravery;
the <HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf boarding the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ad|miral,
<PB N="26" REF="21">
and being &s;ucce&s;sfully, &s;econded by
the re&s;t, the Victory was almo&s;t as &s;oon
completed as begun, the <HI>Turks</HI> being routed
&s;o entirely, that not one Gally e&s;caped,
but what was either &s;unk or taken; and it
mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, That the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;hew'd
&s;o much Conduct during the whole Action,
that no more could have been expected
from the Prudence and Valour of the great|e&s;t
Captain of our time.</P>
<P>So compleat a Victory &s;oon decided the
De&s;tiny of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> for the Garri&s;on, who
had been Spectators of their Lo&s;s, being
now bereav'd of all Hopes of Succours,
demanded a capitulation. In confederation
very honourable of their bravery, they had
Conditions granted them, it being com|prehended
in one of the Articles, that be|fore
their, marching put of the Place, they
&s;hould &s;urrender to the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> a cer|tain
Officer, who had de&s;earted his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty's Service, and di&s;covercd what
he knew concerning his De&s;igns to the
Enemy. The <HI>Czar</HI> to recompence the
Sea-Officers and others on board his Fleet
for their la&s;t Service, and to give them
&s;ome marks of his Liberality, ordered
the Fifty Thou&s;and Ducats, taken
oil board the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Admiral, to be
di&s;tributed among them.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;oph</HI> was no &s;ooner &s;urrendred, but
the <HI>Czar</HI> made it appear to all the World,
that he was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of what
Con&s;equence the Conque&s;t of this Place
was to his Affairs. For, the fir&s;t thing he
<PB N="27" REF="21">
did, was to give his Orders for the re&s;to|ring
the Fortifications, and bringing them
with all po&s;&s;ible Speed, to a &s;tate of De|fence;
and not content with this, he
cau&s;ed the Ancient Walls within the For|tifications,
for the mo&s;t part rain'd by
the Bombs, to be entirely ra&s;ed, and in
lieu thereof, the Foundation was laid of
a new City, td extend to the Fortifica|tions
made of Earth.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e were likewi&s;e con&s;iderably aug|mented
by the Addition of two new
Ba&s;tions in the &s;ame places where we
mentioned before the two obtu&s;e Angles
to have been. All the ancient Ba&s;tions
were enlarged, and made regular, accor|ding
to our modern Rules of Fortification;
each of them being &s;trengthened by a
Half-Moon. The Ditch was defended by
a good Counter&s;carp, with a cover'd
way, from whence was carried a Line
up to the top of the Hill, which over|looks
the Town, where a goodly Fore
was erected (or the Defence of the Line,
and to keep a Communication with the
Place.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Precautions, though very con|&s;iderable
in them&s;elves, yet were thought
in&s;ufficient in re&s;pect of the Accompli&s;h|ment
of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's De&s;ign, who
was re&s;olv'd to render <HI>A&s;oph</HI> impregnable;
as being the main Frontier place on that
&s;ide of the Empire. Pur&s;uant to this
De&s;ign, the Foundation was laid of a new
Fortre&s;s, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>A&s;op,</HI> in the mar&s;hy
<PB N="28" REF="22">
Grounds, which was to have a Communi|cation
with that City by a bridge of thir|ty
Arches to be built over the Mar&s;hes.
This De&s;ign, of which I have &s;een the
Model, was &s;oon put in Execution, the
City which was to be put in the Center of
the place being called <HI>St. Peter.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Body of the Fortifications
con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix Ba&s;tions, the two fir&s;t
facing the River &s;ide, with a Half-Moon
betwixt them. The other two Ba&s;tions
lying on each &s;ide are at a &s;mall di&s;tance
from the others; but the two oppo&s;ite to
the <HI>North,</HI> lye at a much greater di&s;tance,
defended by three Half-Moons The
whole is &s;urrounded with a double Ditch,
and a cover'd way. The Ground upon
winch this Fortre&s;s was built, is rai&s;ed to
that heighth, as to command <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and
when the Wind blows from the <HI>South,</HI>
the Mar&s;hes round about the Fortre&s;s are
all under Water, &s;o that there is but one
way to approach it to wit, by the Bridge.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fortifications would have been
more than &s;ufficient, if His Maje&s;ty had
had no other de&s;ign than to defend his Fron|tiers,
to bridle the <HI>trim Tartars,</HI> and to keep
the neighbouruing <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> inhabiting the Coun|try,
near the <HI>Don,</HI> in awe, but this Monarch
had matters of greater Con&s;equnce in view,
which he knew would in a little time
redound to the great benefit of the Em|pire.
His de&s;ign was to make u&s;e of this
place to &s;erve for the conveniency of carry|ing
down the River the Commodities of
<PB N="29" REF="22">
the product of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> into the <HI>Palus
Maeotis,</HI> and to tran&s;port them by the
way of <HI>Caffa,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> into
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>He wi&s;ely fore&s;aw that by this means he
might introduce, and &s;ettle Navigation in
his Dominions, to the great encrea&s;e of the
Wealth of his Subjects, who thereby
would be u&s;ed to the Sea, &s;o that in time
they might render them&s;elves redoubtable
to their Enemies. But to bring this great
and noble De&s;ign to Perfection, it was ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to put the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Fleet into &s;uch a Condition, as to be able
to coop with the <HI>Turks</HI> in the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> and
to render them&s;elves &s;o formidable, that
the Enemies might be obliged at the next
Peace to allow them a free Commerce, and
the Liberty of their Ports upon tho&s;e
Coa&s;ts, and of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>By the re&s;toring, and &s;trengthning the
Fortifications of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and laying the
Foundation of the new Fortre&s;s of St.
<HI>Peter,</HI> the pre&s;ent <HI>Czar</HI> had in view three
great Points, each of which, as it tended to
the great benefit of the Empire, &s;o it was
&s;ufficient to Eternalize his Memory.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was the making of a conveni|ent
and &s;afe Harbour, capable to contain
a great Fleet.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, the joining of the two Ri|vers,
the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and <HI>Don,</HI> by a Canal, fit
to carry Ships of a great bulk.</P>
<P>And La&s;tly, the building, and equipping
of four&s;core Men of War, as well Frigats
<PB N="30" REF="23">
as Gallies, with a hundred and fifty Brigan|tines,
to make Head again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> where|ever
they &s;hould attempt to di&s;pute with
him the free Commerce at Sea.</P>
<P>It was found quite impracticable to ren|der
<HI>A&s;oph</HI> a good Port; for, tho' the Ri|ver
<HI>Don</HI> is the mo&s;t proper in the World
for Shipping betwixt <HI>Veranowitz</HI> and <HI>A&s;oph,</HI>
as being very deep, without any I&s;lands,
and its Current very &s;mooth, being not
interrupted by any Sands; but the Mouth.
of this River is &s;o full of Shelves, and
choak'd up with Sands, that at Ebb-Tide
there is not above &s;even Foot Water, &s;o
that tho&s;e Geographers who have de&s;crib'd
us the Entrance of this River as very con|venient,
and one of the moil famous Ports,
have impo&s;ed their own Inventions upon
the World for Truth.</P>
<P>It was for this rea&s;on His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
ordered the Coa&s;t thereabouts to be found|ed,
being willing to find out a convenient
Place to make a Port of, as near as po&s;&s;i|bly
could be to the City of <HI>A&s;oph.</HI> When
the <HI>Turks</HI> formerly u&s;ed to &s;end any Ships
of a con&s;iderable burthen to that Town,
they were, obliged to unload near the En|trance
of the River <HI>Mious,</HI> in the <HI>Crim
Tartary,</HI> about five and twenty Leagues
di&s;tancc from <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> where at Low Water,
it is at lea&s;t fifteen or &s;ixteen Foot
deep.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mau&s;covites</HI> &s;ounding along the &s;ame
Coa&s;t, came to a certain Cape at about &s;even
Leagues di&s;teance from the <HI>Don,</HI> where, at
<PB N="31" REF="23">
an Ebb Tide there was twelve Foot, Water.
The Coa&s;t was hereabouts very high, and
&s;teep, the Ground Sandy, but &s;o hard
that it re&s;embled both in Sub&s;tance and
Hardne&s;s a Free-Stone. To the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of the
Cape there was a &s;mall Bay, and at about
a Leagues di&s;tance from thence to the
We&s;t there was a &s;mall River, who&s;e Cur|rent
turn'd in form of a Half-Moon, round
that Point of the Land. The Shoar
from the bay was of an ea&s;ie A&s;cent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> having been exactly informed
Concerning the convenient Scituation of this
Place, order'd a Fort of Five ba&s;tions to
be erected, and a City to be built &s;ome|what
below it, likewi&s;e defended by a good
Fortification, betwixt vvhich and the Bay
there was a Plain, through vvhich vvas to
be cut the great Channel, which was to
di&s;&s;embogue near the Point, of the Land,
into the Sea; and in the mid&s;t of this,
there vvas to i&s;&s;ue another le&s;s Channel
tovvards the Bay, for the conveniency, of
Ve&s;&s;els of le&s;s burthen. I have &s;een the
Model of the vvhole De&s;ign. The Port
is to be, Three Thou&s;and Seven Hundred
and Fifty Foot long, and half as
broad.</P>
<P>Concerning the Conjunction of the
Rivers, <HI>Wolga</HI> and <HI>Don,</HI> vve have already
mentioned before the advantageous Scitua|tion
of the, Grounds betwixt the tvvo Ri|vers,
and the condition of the tvvo le&s;&s;er
ones, which come within a much nearer
di&s;tance of one another, &s;o that the whole
<PB N="32" REF="24">
de&s;ign being founded upon very good
Grounds, it will &s;ucceed in all Probability. For
it is propo&s;ed to &s;top the Waters of the&s;e
two le&s;&s;er Rivers, which are to be join'd
in the Grand Canal by many Sluices, to
bring them to &s;uch a heighth as &s;ha11 be
judged &s;ufficient for the pa&s;&s;age of Ships of
a considerable burthen; there are daily
above tvventy Thou&s;and Men Employed to
dig the Ground, be&s;ides others who are
to bring the vvhole to Perfection.</P>
<P>As to vvhat relates to the third part to

<HI>Czar</HI> made u&s;e in this Point of all the fore|&s;ight
and Prudence that could be e expected
from the mol&s;t refin'd Politician. For, be|ing
immoveable in his Re&s;olution of rid|ding
his Hands of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> that u&s;ed
to &s;tand under the Command of the be&s;t
of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Nobility, he judged not
vvithout Rea&s;on that at this Juncture
he could not pitch upon a more &s;ea&s;ona|ble
and more glorious Expedient than
this, to Employ them in the Service of their
Country, and at the &s;ame time to take
away from them all opportunities of fu|ture
Revolts, Pur&s;uant to this Re&s;olution;
he i&s;&s;ued his Declaration, wherein he told
them that the Pre&s;ent State of Affairs be|ing
&s;uch, as required the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to ap|pear
formidable at Sea, and he being
fully convinced, both of their Valour, and
Fidelity, he wi&s;hed nothing more at this
time, than to &s;ee them apply them&s;elves
to the Knowledge of Maritime Affairs,
<PB N="33" REF="24">
to qualifie them&s;elves for the be&s;t Com|mands
at Sea. That for this purpo&s;e he
had taken all imaginable care to provide
a &s;ufficient. number of Sea Officers, Fa|mous
for their Skill in Maritime Affairs,
and the managing of Sea Engagements,
under who&s;e Conduct they might be
trained up in this Art, and fitted for the
highe&s;t Commands. That he being re|&s;olved
to try the Foundation of the
pre&s;ent Glory of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Monarchy up|on
its Naval Strength, and rendring him|&s;elf
redoubtable at Sea, would head them
in Per&s;on, and &s;hew them by his own Ex|ample
what Foot&s;teps to tread in. According|ly
it was re&s;olved, that each Subject, propor|tionable
to his Ability, &s;hould contribute to
the Equipping, and maintenance of a cer|tain
number of Men of War, the chief Ci|ties
of the Empire, being like wi&s;e obliged to
bear a proportion in this Tax, By this
means His Maje&s;ty Equipped a good Fleet

of this Nature, that there wanted but
little Fuel to kindle the Flame; They
Could not brook the Lo&s;s of their belo|ved
<HI>Strelitzes,</HI> whom they had always
looked upon as the Chief Supporters

them conceive &s;o implacable a Hatred a|gain&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="26">
the Czar, that they entred into a Con|&s;piracy
again&s;t his Life. To put their De&s;ign
in execution, they had brought over to
their Party four Captains of the fir&s;t Re|giment
of the <HI>Strelitzes;</HI> but the difficulty
was, in what manner the Attempt was to
be made For they look'd upon it as im|practicable,
to declare openly again&s;t a
Prince, who, be&s;ides that he was much be|loved
by the People, had at his devotion
a good Number or the be&s;t Troops, Com|manded
by foreign Officers, who were
quartered in and about the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI>
and ready upon all Occasions to &s;acrifice
their Lives for His Maje&s;ty. It was pro|po&s;ed
among them, That the Czar was
u&s;ed to go &s;ometimes abroad with very
&s;lender Attendance, and to appear in the
Streets of <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> without any con&s;idera|ble
Retinue; this was al&s;o look'd upon as
too dangerous, con&s;idering the general Love
the People bore to his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>After many Debates, it was at la&s;t re|&s;olved,
That con&s;idering that Czar, who
takes &s;hare in every thing that concerns his
Subjects Welfare, was wont to appear in
Per&s;on, in ca&s;e of any Accident of Fire,
which frequently happens, and makes a
mo&s;t terrible Havock in the City of <HI>Mu&s;|cow,</HI>
where mo&s;t of the Hou&s;e are of
Wood; they look'd upon this as the mo&s;t
proper Opportunity to encompa&s;s their
De&s;ign; wherefore it was concluded to &s;et
Fire to &s;ome Hou&s;es in the night-time,
when they did not que&s;tion to draw the
<PB N="37" REF="26">
Czar thither, and during the Confu&s;ion,
to find means to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. The
next thing to be done was, (according to
their own Confe&s;&s;ion) to have joyn'd the
<HI>Donaick Co&s;&s;acks</HI> with their Party, to have
relea&s;ed the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> from her Con|finement,
recall'd Prince <HI>Wa&s;&s;ily Galizin</HI> out
of <HI>Siberia,</HI> and &s;urrendred the Admini&s;tra|tion
of the Govevernment into their hands,
who were al&s;o to re&s;tore the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> to
their antient Station.</P>
<P>But it plea&s;ed Heaven to touch the hearts
of two of the&s;e four Captains, that
were Engaged in this Con&s;piracy; their
Names were <HI>Largon Gili&s;arof</HI> and <HI>Gregory
Sileri,</HI> who being &s;truck with Remor&s;e at
the penetrating of &s;o dete&s;table a Fact, did
throw them&s;elves at His Maje&s;ty's feet, in|genuou&s;ly
confe&s;&s;ing their Crimes, and di&s;|covering
their Accomplices, that very day
preceding the Night which this Tragedy was
to be acted.</P>
<P>It was on the 1&s;t day of <HI>February,</HI> in
the year 1697, when His Maje&s;ty was in|form'd
concerning this Con&s;piracy formed
again&s;t his Life, at the Hou&s;e of General
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> where he happened to dine that
Day, He appear'd very little mov'd at
&s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a piece of News, but, without
any Change in his Countenance, aro&s;e from
the Table, and being followed only by a
few Per&s;ons, in whom he confided mo&s;t,
he went directly to the Hou&s;e of the Chief
of the Con&s;pirators, who&s;e Name was <HI>John
Sickler,</HI> and elevated by the Czar to the
<PB N="38" REF="27">
Dignity of a Councellour of State. When
His Maje&s;ty came to the Hou&s;e of this wic|ked
Wretch, he commanded the re&s;t to
remain without doors; He him&s;elf entred
only with three Gentlemen more, and
pretending he had occa&s;ion to ask his Ad|vice
in &s;ome Matter of Moment, ordered
he &s;hould follow him; But no &s;ooner was
he come into the Street but he was &s;eiz'd,
and immediately carried to Pri&s;on, as were
likewi&s;e five more that were his Accom|plices
in the Con&s;piracy; to wit, The <HI>Boyar
Alexis Sekouin, Fedor Puskin,</HI> Son of the
<HI>Boyar, Matfe Pu&s;kin,</HI> two Captains of the
<HI>Strelitzes,</HI> and a <HI>Donaick Co&s;&s;ack.</HI> They all
confe&s;s'd their Crimes, and being condemn|ed
by all the <HI>Boyars,</HI> were executed on
the fifth day of <HI>March,</HI> in the Year 1697,
in the Great Market-place, before the Ca|&s;tle.
Fir&s;t, their Arms and Legs were cut
off, then they had their Heads &s;evered from
their Bodies. Their Heads were fixed on
the top of a Stone Column, erected for
that purpo&s;e, and their Arms and Legs
&s;truck upon Iron-bars round about it; the
Trunks of their dead Carca&s;&s;es were left
in the Market-place for eight days after;
till the Scent became &s;o nau&s;eous to the In|habitants,
that, they were forced to be re|mov'd
from thence.</P>
<P>It having by Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the
Con&s;pirators been made apparent, That the
<HI>Boyar, Ivan Milo&s;laski</HI> was the Chief Head of
the Rebellion which hapned in the year
1682, immediately after pre&s;ent Czar|i&s;h

Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, his Body
Was di&s;interr'd, which being found very
near intire, without any con&s;iderable decay
(tho' it had lain under ground near twelve
Years,) &s;everal Gibbets were erected, on
which were hung the Quarters of his Car|ca&s;s,
which were torn to pieces in an in|&s;tance
by the enraged Multitude.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal In-lets contrived and car|ried
on again&s;t his Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty's Per|&s;on
and Life, are &s;o many in&s;tances, to
convince the World, how dangerous it is
for a Prince to change the antient form of
a Government, it being unque&s;tionable,
that thereby he mu&s;t needs draw upon
him&s;elf the implacable Hatred of that
Party, who arc Sufferers by that Change.
But it mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;s'd, that no|thing
can be more glorious for a Prince,
than to promote the publick Welfare, at
the peril of his own Life; which may
without the lea&s;t Contradiction to truth,
be applyed to the pre&s;ent Czar <HI>Peter A|lexiovitz,</HI>
who had no other Aim in re|moving
the antient e&s;tabli&s;h'd Guards of
the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> from their Station, than
the publick Tranquility; knowing this
arrogant and violent body of Troops, to
have been the Source of the many Re|volts
and Troubles, that have hara&s;&s;ed the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire in our Age.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to
pardon &s;uch of the Con&s;pirators, as were
not &s;o deeply engaged in the De&s;ign a|gain&s;t
his Life, being now re&s;olved to

till he &s;aw the Succe&s;s of the
Siege of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> not que&s;tioning but that
he &s;hould then be for &s;ome time upon
the defen&s;ive, till the beforemention|ed

which he had projected, could be brought
to perfection.</P>
<P>He was &s;ufficiently &s;entible, That, con|&s;idering,
the pre&s;ent State of his Empire
was founded, upon the &s;ervice of his fo|reign
Officers, and a good Naval &s;trength,
whereby he might appear formidable in

&s;everal times &s;ince, that as &s;oon as the
young Prince his Son &s;hould be fit to
Travel, he would &s;end him to the Court,
of <HI>Berlix,</HI> to tarry there for &s;ome con|&s;iderable
Time.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had their High and Migh|tine&s;&s;es,
the States General of the United
Provinces received advice, that this &s;o|lemn
Emba&s;&s;y was on their way towards
their Frontiers, but they &s;ent &s;ome De|puties,
who were to receive their Ex|cellencies
in the name of the States Ge|neral
upon the Frontiers; and orders
were given not only to defray them at the
Charge of the State, but to welcome
them with con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents, and by
<PB N="46" REF="31">
the di&s;charge of the great Cannon of all
the great Towns through which they pa&s;|&s;ed;
their High and Mightine&s;&s;es being
willing upon &s;o extaordinary an Occa&s;ion,
to eternalize the Memory of the Honour,
they were going to receive by &s;o &s;olemn
an Emba&s;&s;y, the mo&s;t glorious that ever
was &s;een; in re&s;pect of Per&s;onal Apppear|ance
of &s;o great a Monarch, with whom
they were Engaged in a mo&s;t &s;trict Tye
of Friend&s;hip and Commerce. After
they had travelled &s;ome Leagues in the
Territories of the United Provinces, his
Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty left the Emba&s;&s;y, that
he might with the more &s;peed reach
the City of <HI>Am&s;teldam;</HI> and that by tra|velling
thus in Di&s;gui&s;e, he might with
the more freedom, and unperceived, take
a view of every thing he thought worth
his Curio&s;ity. Accordingly he came to
<HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> accompanied only by two or
three Gentlemen, &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, as not to
be known by any body, where he lodg|ed,
at a Common-Inn for one night on|ly,
The next day he went to <HI>Sordam,</HI> a
large Town on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the
River of <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> and about two Leagues
di&s;tant, this place being mo&s;t famous
for the great number of Ship-Wrights
and others, who are there employed con|tinually
in building of Ships.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty immediately after his ar|rival
there, took up with a private lodg|ings
at a <HI>Burgher</HI>'s Hou&s;e, which lay much
out of the way, his aim being to keep him|&s;elf
<PB N="47" REF="31">
from being di&s;covered, as much as
Po&s;&s;ible could be. His Chief and fir&s;t em|polyment
in this place, was to inform
him&s;elf in per&s;on from the Work-mens
own Mouths, and to be an Eye-witne&s;s
in what manner they built their Ships;
He bought a &s;mall Yacht of about twen|ty
five or thirty Foot long, which he
took a particular Plea&s;ure to &s;teer
him&s;elf, and to Sail in the Company on|ly
of tho&s;e three Gentlemen, that at|tended
him up and down the River of
<HI>Am&s;teldam</HI> (called the <HI>Tey</HI>) where his grea|te&s;t
delight was, to make his own Ob|&s;ervations,
and to feed his eyes with that
mo&s;t beautiful Pro&s;pect of that va&s;t num|ber
of Ships, which not unlike a Forre&s;t,
lie clo&s;e together in the Road of that
City.</P>
<P>But it was not many days before he
was robbed of the Satisfaction of pa&s;&s;ing
away his time thus undi&s;covered. For a
certain Lock-Smith, who had lived a few
years before in the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> hap|pening
to take particular. Notice of
him one day, as he pa&s;&s;ed by, knew him
fir&s;t; and having told &s;ome of his Com|rades,
the inhabitant flock'd in &s;uch Num|bers
about him, when he appear'd a|broad,
that being tired with the Crowd,
he re&s;olved to leave <HI>Sordam,</HI> &s;ooner than
he intended at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>This News being come to Ears of
the Merchants of <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> Trading to
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> &s;ome of whom had the Honour
<PB N="48" REF="32">
to know His Maje&s;ty, they immediately
went in a Body to pay him all imagi|nable
Re&s;pe&s;t, and to pray him to ho|nour
them with his Pre&s;ence in the City
of <HI>Am&s;teldam;</HI> where he arrived from <HI>Sor|dam</HI>
&s;ome days before the Amba&s;&s;adours,
who had received Orders to tarry for &s;ome
time there, before they went to the <HI>Hague,</HI>
in order to be Admitted to the publick
Audience of Their High and Mightine&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Magi&s;trates of
<HI>Am&s;teldam</HI> took effectual Care to provide
every thing for the Magnificent Reception
of the &s;aid Emba&s;&s;y, great &s;tore of Can|non
being planted upon the Ba&s;tions, facing
the River <HI>Am&s;tell,</HI> which way the Amba&s;|&s;adours
were to come. All the young
Men of the City mounted on Hor&s;eback,
with very &s;plendid Equipages and tho&s;e
of the be&s;t Rank and Quality, went to
meet him in their Coaches. The Ma|gi&s;trates
deputed &s;ome of their Members
to Compliment Their Excellencies at
their Landing, which was about a quarter
of a League without the City, whither
they were conducted in the Yatchs of the
State, and received with a Di&s;charge of
all the Cannon round the Ramparts.</P>
<P>The three Amba&s;&s;adours wire conduct|ed
by the Deputies into the Coach of one
of the Chief Magi&s;trates of the City; the
Deputies took their Places in the &s;econd,
and the re&s;t of the Coaches were taken up
by the Gentlemen of the Emba&s;&s;y, among
whom, as it was reported, was His Czar|i&s;h
<PB N="49" REF="32">
Maje&s;ty. But fir&s;t of all, rid the be|forementioned
Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback,
who leading the Van, were followed by
the Trumpets of the State, and the&s;e by
&s;ome <HI>Tartars,</HI> Armed with Bows, and
&s;ome <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> on Hor&s;eback. After the&s;e
marched on foot twenty Pages belonging
to Their Excellencies the Amba&s;&s;adours,
very richly Clad, their Coats being of
Scarlet Cloth, covered all over with very
rich Gold and Silver Galloons. The&s;e
went immediately before the Coach, where|in
&s;at the three Amba&s;&s;adours, Guarded
on each &s;ide by twelve Tall and lu&s;ty
Fellows, Cloath'd in a <HI>Slavonian</HI> Dre&s;s, car|rying
each a Silver Ax in their hands, and
Cimmetars with Silver Hilts on their Sides.
They had red Cloaks over their <HI>Ca&s;&s;acques,</HI>
trimm'd on both &s;ides with large Silver
Buttons, and large Plated Loops; all which
together, made a very Glorious and Mag|nificent
Show. The&s;e Coaches were fol|lowed
by a great many Footmen, like|wi&s;e
clad in red Scarlet Cloath, trim|med
with Silver Galloons. His Excellen|cy
the General <HI>Le Fort,</HI> appeared that day
in an <HI>Europian</HI> Habit, and the other two
Amba&s;&s;adours, in a Mu&s;covite Dre&s;s, but
their Apparel was extreamly Rich. Thus
they pa&s;&s;ed in very good order through
the Chiefe&s;t Streets of <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> to the
Lodgings prepared for them, where &s;tood
a Company of City Trained-bands in
Arms, to render their Reception the more
Magnificent; All the Streets through which
<PB N="50" REF="33">
they pa&s;&s;ed, were crowded with an in|finite
number of People, who were flock'd
to the City to be Spectators of the mo&s;t
&s;olemn Entrance that had been &s;een there
for many years before; and for &s;everal
days after, their Excellencies were trea|ted
with all the magnificence imagina|ble,
at the Charge of the City of
<HI>Am&s;teldam;</HI> all which, though it amount|ed
to a con&s;iderable Summ, neverthele&s;s
the Magi&s;trates being willing upon this
Occa&s;ion to give the mo&s;t ample
Demon&s;trations that po&s;&s;ible could be, of
their E&s;teem and Re&s;pect for His Czari&s;h
Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, cau&s;ed a great Fire-Work
to be prepared, repre&s;enting a Triumph|al-Arch,
in Honour of his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>It was erected upon the River <HI>Am|&s;tel</HI>
(which had communicated, its Name
to the Famous City of <HI>Am&s;teldam</HI>) in a
place where it might be &s;een at a great di|&s;tance,
being of great height, and having
four Fronts alike to the four principal Cor|ners
of the World; the whole Fabrick being
of the <HI>Corinthian Order,</HI> adorned with the
Arms of His Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty, with Tritons,
Ve&s;&s;els, and many other Embelli&s;h|ments.
The whole Machine was built
upon many Flat-bottom'd Ve&s;&s;els, join'd
clo&s;e together, which being covered
all over with a Linnen Painted Cloth, the
bottom upon which the Fabrick was found|ed,
repre&s;ented at a di&s;tance, a &s;mall I&s;land.</P>
<P>This Fire-work being too remote from
their Excellencies Lodgings, to be &s;een
<PB N="51" REF="33">
there in its full Perfection, the Magi|&s;trates
intreated them to go with them
to a noted Tavern of <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> called
the <HI>Doclan,</HI> where they had the advan|tage
of being Spectators of the Succe&s;s
of the Fire-works, to their entire Satisfa|ction,
and were regaled with a mo&s;t
magnificent Collation. His Maje&s;ty being
graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to appear in per&s;on at
this Fea&s;t; it was then the fir&s;t time,
that I had the opportunity of taking a
full view of him, as well as others, at
lei&s;ure. He is a very Tall and Lu&s;ty
Per&s;on, Well &s;et, with very good Features
in his Face, and, though there is a great
deal Vivacity in his Eyes, (which are
Black and Sprightly) as well as Activity
in his whole Air, he has certain Marks
of a Sweet Di&s;po&s;ition in his Phy&s;iogno|my.
He is very affable in Conver&s;ation,
giving frequent opportunities to be enter|tained
with any thing that is Curious.</P>
<P>Some Hours after it was Dark, the
Fire-works began to Play, with extraor|dinary
Succe&s;s, to the Admiration of all
the Spectators in General, and His Czar|i&s;h
Maje&s;ty in partiulcar, who could not
&s;ufficicntly &s;peak prai&s;e in of it, and de|clare
publickly the Satisfaction he had
taken in the whole Entertainment. The
Concour&s;e of People was &s;o. great at this
publick Rejoycing, that by the Throng,
&s;ome of the Iron Rails of the Bridge of
the <HI>Am&s;tel</HI> being broke down, a great
many of tho&s;e upon the Bridge, fell into
<PB N="52" REF="34">
to the River, &s;ome of whom were drown|ed,
the re&s;t narrowly e&s;caping with Life,
by the help of &s;ome Boats that were near at
hand.</P>
<P>But the Deputies of the Admiralty of
<HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> bring &s;en&s;ible that they could
give no greater &s;atisfaction to the <HI>Czar,</HI>
than in what related to the knowledge of
Naval Affairs, took effectual care to &s;hew
his Maje&s;ty all their Store-Hou&s;es, belong|ing
to the Building and Equipping of their
Men of War.</P>
<P>I have it from good Hands, that the&s;e
Gentlemen who were deputed to attend
him thither, were extremely &s;urpri&s;ed to
&s;ee him with &s;o much eagerne&s;s enquire
after every thing, that had the lea&s;t rela|tion
to the&s;e Affairs, and with how much
Skill and Judgment he would talk and argue
concerning the&s;e Matters, into which (as
they were per&s;waded before) he had but a
&s;lender In&s;ight.</P>
<P>Some Days after, his Maje&s;ty took a Pro|gre&s;s
to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> where he had an Inter|view
with his <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty; this being
the fir&s;t time the&s;e two Great Princes, E|minent
for their Virtue and Bravery, met.
They Di&s;cour&s;ed for &s;everal Hours toge|ther,
and parted from one another with all
the marks of a mutual high E&s;teem.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors &s;tay'd near two Months
at <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> before they went to the
<HI>Hague,</HI> in order to their Audience: For
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty being re&s;olv'd that they
&s;hould make their Appearance there with
<PB N="53" REF="34">
all the Splendor imaginable, Order'd that
the Number of their Dome&s;ticks &s;hould
be con&s;iderably augmented, that they
&s;hould be all new Cloathed, and Richer
than before. They had al&s;o an addition
to their Equipage three of the riche&s;t Coach|es
that could be made, with &s;o many Sets
of very fine Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Every thing being got ready for their
Departure to the <HI>Hague,</HI> they &s;et out on
their Journey, carrying along with them
good &s;tore of Sables and other rich Furs,
to be Pre&s;ented to their High and Mighti|ne&s;&s;es
from the <HI>Czar</HI> their Ma&s;ter, pur|&s;uant
to the Cu&s;tom of mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Na|tions.</P>
<P>Their Excellencies were receiv'd at the
<HI>Hague,</HI> with all the marks of Honour and
Re&s;pect due to their High Character, and
the Day for their publick Audience being
appointed, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty followed
in Per&s;on in Di&s;gui&s;e, wearing a plain
blew Coat, a large white Perriwig, and
white Feather; and being perfectly well
acquainted both with the Per&s;on, and ex|traordinary
Merits of the Sieur <HI>Wit&s;en</HI> (who
is this Year Burgo-Ma&s;ter of <HI>Am&s;teldam</HI>)
he borrowed his Coach, and de&s;ired him to
accompany him thither, Which was per|formed
with &s;o much dexterity and &s;ecrecy
by the &s;aid Sieur <HI>de Wit&s;en,</HI> that his Ma|je&s;ty
was not di&s;cover'd by any body li|ving.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="35">
It was in the Month of <HI>September</HI> of the
la&s;t Year, when there was the greate&s;t
&s;how of Forreign Amba&s;&s;adors, that ever
was &s;een at the <HI>Hague,</HI> occa&s;ion'd by the
Negotiation of Peace at <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> whither
mo&s;t Courts of <HI>Europe</HI> had &s;ent their Pleni|potentiaries,
who all &s;triving to outview
one another in Magnificence, it was no
ea&s;ie matter to add any thing to the Splen|dor
of their Equipages: Yet his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty being &s;en&s;ible that the Eyes of the
World, would in a mo&s;t peculiar manner
be fixed upon his Emba&s;&s;y; and being in|vited
by a mo&s;t commendable Emulation;
to maintain upon this, as well as all other
occa&s;ions the Glory and Lu&s;tre of his Emi|nent
Station in the World, as claiming the
Title of an Emperor, and bearing the Im|perial
Arms, he was fully re&s;olv'd that
this mo&s;t Solemn Emba&s;&s;y, honour'd by his
Pre&s;ence, &s;hould bear the marks of, and be
an&s;werable to his Grandeur.</P>
<P>In effect, according to the Te&s;timony of
all that were Spectators of this Solemn Au|dience,
every thing was manag'd with &s;o
much Order, Maje&s;ty and Gravity, and
with &s;o much Magnificence, that nothing
could be added to the Lu&s;tre of this Solem|nity,
which in all Re&s;pects was &s;uitable to
his Maje&s;ty's De&s;ign and Grandeur.</P>
<P>It is confe&s;s'd by all hands, that never
any Amba&s;&s;ador appear'd in a more Splen|did
Attire, than the General <HI>le Fort,</HI> the
fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador did that Day; he was
Clad after the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fa&s;hion, in a long
<PB N="55" REF="35">
Robe of Cloth of Gold, Lin'd with the
mo&s;t precious Sables that ever were &s;een.
This Robe, as well as the Ve&s;t which he
wore under it, was cover'd before with Di|amonds
of an ine&s;timable Value, and upon
his Bonnet there appear'd a large Jewel of
Diamonds in the &s;hape of a Herns Feather,
with &s;uch lu&s;tre as dazled the Eyes of the
Beholders: He harangued their High and
Mightine&s;&s;es id the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Tongue, with
an Air altogether Maje&s;tick, &s;uitable to the
Character he bore upon &s;o Solemn an Occa|&s;ion.
The two other Amba&s;&s;adors, who
appear'd likewi&s;e in very Rich Apparel,
made al&s;o their Compliments to their High
and Mightine&s;&s;es with a Maje&s;tick Gravity:
But that which added the greate&s;t Lu&s;tre to
this Audience, was, that all the Amba&s;&s;a|dors
of mo&s;t Princes in <HI>Europe,</HI> honour'd
the&s;e Men with their Pre&s;ence, and his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had the &s;atisfaction to be
an Eye Witne&s;s of all what pa&s;&s;ed, from a
Clo&s;et which had a Window opening into
the Audience Room, without being per|ceived
by any body, and returned the next
day privately to <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> extreamly
well plea&s;ed with his Journey. Neither did
their Excellencies make any long &s;tay at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> they having no other Matters to
propo&s;e to the States, but the confirmation
of former Treaties.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands, that the prin|cipal
Motive of this <HI>Emba&s;&s;y</HI> was, that un|der
the &s;pecious Pretence of this Publick
Solemnity, the <HI>Czar</HI> might with the more
<PB N="56" REF="36">
conveniency pa&s;s <HI>Incognito,</HI> through &s;uch
Places as he intended to vi&s;it; his particu|lar
aim in re&s;pect to his Journey into <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
being to have the opportunity of
being undi&s;cover'd at <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> to take,
with the more conveniency a full view of
&s;uch Matters as related to Maritime Affairs,
and without any di&s;turbance, to take Peo|ple
fit for the Sea-Service into his Pay, and
at the &s;ame time to &s;upply him&s;elf with
&s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries, as was requi&s;ite for the
carrying on his Grand De&s;ign.</P>
<P>This &s;ufficiently appear'd after his return
from the <HI>Hague,</HI> by his Reque&s;t to the
Magi&s;trates of <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI> to wit, to chu&s;e
private Lodgings for him&s;elf, and a few
Gentlemen of his Retinue at one end of
the City. It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd the Lodg|ings
were but very indifferent, in re&s;pect of
the Quality of the Per&s;on that was to Inha|bit
them; but in regard of their Situation,
they were in all Points agreeable to his
Maje&s;ty's Intention, they being ju&s;t adjoyn|ing
to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Hou&s;e, which lying
near a convenient Road for Ships, there
was the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect that could
be to the Water-&s;ide, of all what pa&s;&s;ed to
or from <HI>Am&s;teldam.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner hail his Maje&s;ty taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the&s;e &s;mall Lodgings, but he ap|plied
all his Thoughts to the knowledge of
two Things: The fir&s;t was to be In&s;tructed
in all Particulars; which had any relation
to the Building and Equipping of Ships:
The &s;econd, to learn the manner of Bom|barding
<PB N="57" REF="36">
Places by Sea, which being a thing
he was de&s;irous to be inform'd of, he &s;par'd
no pains to attain to. But as his Genius
was always bent to the Mathematicks, and
as he had been In&s;tructed mo&s;t particularly
in the Mechanick part of it, which contains
the Fundamental Principles of both: It was
yet long before he made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of
the&s;e My&s;terious Arts; e&s;pecially, &s;ince his
de&s;ire was &s;uch, as not to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd
with being a looker on, but would lay him|&s;elf
a hand to the Work &s;ometimes, with a
great deal of Plea&s;ure, and fini&s;h a piece
with his own Hands, which he did with &s;o
much dexterity, that one would have
&s;wore he had been accu&s;tomed long ago, to
handle the Axe and the Hammer. I have
my &s;elf &s;een two pieces of his own Handy-Work;
one was a &s;mall Frigat of three or
four Foot long, the other a little Wind-Mill.</P>
<P>What el&s;e can be gathered from all this,
but that his Conduct in relation to the&s;e
Matters, is founded upon mo&s;t profound
Rea&s;ons of State? It &s;eems evident to me,
that the &s;ole motive of it, is the Glory
and Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Monarchy;
and that by the eagerne&s;s he &s;hews upon
this occa&s;ion, of advancing the Naval
Strength of his Empire, he intends to give
the mo&s;t evident demon&s;tratons he is able,
(to his Nobility and People) that on its due
E&s;tabli&s;hment, depends the chief Welfare
of the Realm; and that by dive&s;ting him|&s;elf
thus of his Royal Dignity for a time,
<PB N="58" REF="37">
and applying him&s;elf in Per&s;on to the Build|ing
of Ships, he intends to &s;erve for an
Example to invite them to follow his Foot|&s;teps.
He is too &s;en&s;ible that the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
are naturally inclin'd to Pride and
Lazine&s;s, and he look'd upon it as the be&s;t
means to correct tho&s;e Vices in them, and
hinder their further progre&s;s among them,
if he by his own Example did encourage
them to Labour and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>At his &s;pare Hours, his greate&s;t delight
u&s;ed
to be, to take a view Of any thing that
was curious, or worth his ob&s;ervation in
private Per&s;ons Hou&s;es, where he lay'd hold
of all opportunities, to enter into a fami|liar
Di&s;cour&s;e with them, in &s;o obliging a
manner, that the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who are ex|treamly
taken with familiar Conver&s;ation,
were charm'd with his franck Behaviour;
which had this effect upon them, that it is
almo&s;t incredible, how many voluntarily
offer'd them&s;elves to &s;erve him; I having
been an Eye-witne&s;s my &s;elf, that a great
number of able and well de&s;erving Per&s;ons
could Hot be admitted into the Service, be|cau&s;e
the intended Levies were compleated
in much le&s;s time than was expected.</P>
<P>Not long after the Amba&s;&s;adors return
from the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Maje&s;ty receiv'd an
Expre&s;s from <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> with the agreeable
News of a Battle, fought betwixt the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI>
under the Command of the Prince
<HI>Schein;</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> near <HI>A&s;oph.</HI> The
<HI>Cham</HI> of the <HI>Crim Tartary,</HI> had in the be|ginning
of the Spring, cau&s;ed a great num|ber
<PB N="59" REF="37">
of <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> to pa&s;s in many &s;mall
Bodies, and at different times thro' <HI>Caffa,</HI>
in order to join them with the <HI>Tartars</HI> of
<HI>Circa&s;&s;ia;</HI> and e&s;pecially tho&s;e Inhabiting
near the River <HI>Cubance.</HI> Knowing that the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army was divided into V&s;everal
Bodies, the better to cover the Workmen,
that were employed in &s;everal Places, in
compleating the before-mentioned Fortifi|cations,
he look'd upon this as a fit oppor|tunity
to &s;urpri&s;e them unawares: For
which purpo&s;e, he order'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> Com|manded
by <HI>Sultan Galga,</HI> to advance with
great and &s;peedy Marches toward the Ene|my.
But the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> General <HI>Schein,</HI> ha|ving
received Intelligence of their approach,
had ju&s;t &s;o much lei&s;ure given him, as to
draw together his Troops in an advan|tageous
place, where he re&s;olv'd to engage
the Enemy. The&s;e perceiving them&s;elves
&s;uperiour in number to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and
being encourag'd by that pretended fear
of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army, which did not
move from their Po&s;t, fell with great fury
upon them, and were received with great
bravery by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> who were con|tented
to defend them&s;elves in their Po&s;t,
till their General perceiving the fir&s;t heat
of the <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;pent, attack'd them very
briskly, put them fir&s;t into Confu&s;ion, and
&s;oon after to the Rout, with a great
Slaughter on the Enemies &s;ide, whom they
pur&s;ued to the River <HI>Hagalinek,</HI> where ma|ny
of them were drowned: This River
runs through <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> about two Leagues
<PB N="60" REF="38">
di&s;tant from <HI>A&s;oph.</HI> Our Maps put this Ri|ver
to the North on the other &s;ide of the
River <HI>Don,</HI> above thirty Leagues from
<HI>A&s;oph</HI></P>
<P>Their Excellencies the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adors
made publick Rejoycings upon
this Occa&s;ion, and invited the Magi&s;trates
and other Per&s;ons of Quality to a Magni|ficent
Entertainment, where they were di|verted,
with Dancing, Mu&s;ick, Fireworks,
and all &s;orts of other Diverti&s;ement. His
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to appear there
in Per&s;on, and in &s;o plea&s;ant a Humour,
that all the Gue&s;s were extreamly &s;atisfy'd
with his Goodne&s;s, and at parting, made all
the mo&s;t &s;incere Prote&s;tations to his Ma|je&s;ty,
that they &s;hould keep in everla&s;ting
Remembrance, the extraordinary Favour
be had been pleas'd to be&s;tow upon them,
in honouring them with his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Towards the beginning of the Winter,
this Victory was Seconded by the News of
another Advantage, obtain a near the Ri|ver
<HI>Bory&s;thenes.</HI> For the <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> in
conjunction with tho&s;e of <HI>Budziack</HI> and
<HI>Oczakow</HI> having be&s;ieged <HI>Ka&s;ikermeen,</HI> had
carried on their Trenches to the very Coun|ter&s;carp,
and at the &s;ame time made them|&s;elves
Ma&s;ters of the Adjacent &s;mall I&s;le of
<HI>Towam.</HI> But a Body of <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> having
joined the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> inhabiting tho&s;e Fren|tiers,
came time enough to the relief of
the Place, forcing the <HI>Tartars</HI> to abandon
the Siege and the I&s;le, with a con&s;iderable
lo&s;s on their &s;ide. Upon which his Maje&s;ty
<PB N="61" REF="38">
gave Orders, that the &s;aid I&s;land &s;hould
be &s;trengthned by &s;ome regular Fortifi|cations.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Expre&s;s brought likewi&s;e the
News, that the new Harbour about, &s;even
Leagues from <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> (of which mention
has been made before) was brought to per|fection,
the Place being already Inhabited
by Ten Thou&s;and <HI>Mufcovites,</HI> his Maje&s;ty
having expre&s;ly forbidden any Forreign
Nation to &s;ettle there. He gave the Name
of <HI>Setruchina Tuba</HI> to this City. In a little
time after, Advice was al&s;o brought his
Maje&s;ty, that a great number of the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian Tarltars</HI>
voluntarily &s;ubmitted to
his Obedience; and thereupon being joined
by &s;ome <HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops, they had ex|tended
their Conque&s;ts into the <HI>Crim Tar|tary,</HI>
to the River <HI>Mious,</HI> about five and
twenty Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> where
the <HI>Turks</HI> formerly u&s;ed to unload their
Ships bound to that Place; and that the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were then bu&s;ie in building a
&s;trong Fort near the Mouth of that River,
thereby to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of,
and to command that Road.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> having now taken a re&s;olution
to pa&s;s over into <HI>England,</HI> before his de|parture
out of this Country, gave notice
of his Intention to his <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty,
who immediately &s;ent &s;ome Yachts and
light Friggots to conduct him thither. He
Embark'd with an Attendance only of
Twelve or Fifteen Per&s;ons, ordering his
Amba&s;&s;adors to &s;tay behind at <HI>Am&s;teldam,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="39">
and to buy up good &s;tore of Artillery and
Ammunition: And being happily arriv'd
in <HI>England,</HI> he was received there with all
the Honour and Re&s;pect due to &s;o Great a
Prince; His <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty offering him
for his Re&s;idence the Royal Palace, call'd
<HI>Sommer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> (which is very Remark|able
for its plea&s;ant Scituation on the River
<HI>Thames,</HI>) and a Guard to attend his Per&s;on;
but the <HI>Czar</HI> per&s;i&s;ting in his Re&s;olution
to pa&s;s his time in <HI>England,</HI> Incognito, he
refu&s;ed to accept of the King of <HI>England's</HI>
Offers.</P>
<P>After he had received the Compliments
from his Maje&s;ty and the Royal Family,
and return'd the &s;ame to them, he &s;pent
&s;ome time in taking a view of the Two
Hou&s;es of Parliament, and what el&s;e was
worth his Ob&s;ervation at Court; and then
retir'd at &s;ome di&s;tance from the City of
<HI>London.</HI> for the conveniency of the Pro|&s;pect
upon the River, from whence he
might ob&s;erve the Workmen, that were
Employed thereabouts in the building of
Ships. He &s;tay'd above Two Months in
<HI>England,</HI> during which time, he Employ'd
mo&s;t of his &s;pare Hours, in viewing all
what was Curious or Remarkable, e&s;pe|cially
among the be&s;t Arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>Some <HI>London</HI> Merchants having propo&s;ed
to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, the E&s;tabli&s;hment
of a new Commerce of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> to be
Tran&s;ported only by them into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
and the other Countries under his Maje&s;ty's
Obedience, he &s;ent for <HI>Fedor Alexiovitz
<PB N="63" REF="39">
Gallavin,</HI> his Second Amba&s;&s;ador, to Treat
with them concerning this Point at <HI>London;</HI>
The Treaty was brought to a good i&s;&s;ue, to
the &s;atisfaction of both Parties; and it has
been computed, that the <HI>Czar's</HI> Yearly
Cu&s;toms ari&s;ing from that Commodity,
will amount to above a Million of <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>But what is worth our particular Ob&s;er|vation
in this Voyage into <HI>England,</HI> and
which mo&s;t of all di&s;covers the main De|&s;ign
of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, is, his Progre&s;s
to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> to be a Spectator of a Sea
Engagement betwixt two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squa|drons,
near that Port. I had forgot to tell
you before, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did Enter|tain
him near <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> with &s;uch ano|ther
Mock-&s;ight, where a great many Yachts
were drawn up in different Lines, to &s;hew
to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty the manner of En|gaging
one another, and Retiring after
an Engagement at Sea.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty having been pre&s;ent|ed
by the King of <HI>England,</HI> with a very
fine Yatch, Richly Guilt, carrying Thirty
Pieces of Cannon, and one of the nimble&s;t
for Sailing in the whole Kingdom; he
&s;ent her to <HI>Archangle,</HI> and he him&s;elf re|turn'd,
notwith&s;tanding the badne&s;s of the
Sea&s;on into, <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while that their Excellen|cies
were gone back to the Hague, in Order
to take their Audience of Leave from their
High and Mightine&s;&s;es, the Magi&s;trates of
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> being &s;en&s;ible, that immediately
after their Return, the <HI>Czar</HI> would &s;et for|forward
<PB N="64" REF="40">
on his Journey to <HI>Vienna,</HI> made
great preparations to &s;ignalize their Zeal for
His Maje&s;ty by &s;ome fre&s;h marks of Ho|nour:
But he no &s;ooner had notice of their
De&s;ign, but he &s;ent to de&s;ire them to de|&s;i&s;t,
being willing to leave their City with|out
noi&s;e, and undi&s;cover'd, after a Thou|&s;and
Te&s;timonies of their E&s;teem and
Friend&s;hip to his Per&s;on, received both
from the Magi&s;trates and other Inhabitants,
during the Six Months he had &s;tay'd among
them.</P>
<P>He was ju&s;t upon his departure, when he
was &s;urpri&s;ed by the unwelcome News,
that there had been a Mutiny near the Ci|ty
of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> among &s;ome Remainders
of the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> but that General <HI>Gourdon</HI>
had &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them, and taken mo&s;t
of their Ringleaders Pri&s;oners; who as
they have thereby ha&s;ten'd the entire Ruine
of their Party, &s;o they have brought them|&s;elves
to a mi&s;erable End, having received
&s;ince that time the due Rewards of their
Treachery. For a great Number of them
were Hang'd on Gibbets, and many of the
Nobility had their Heads cut off.</P>
<P>You cannot be ignorant of what has
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Departure
out of <HI>Holland;</HI> with what Honour and
Re&s;pect this Great Prince was received at
the Imperial Court of <HI>Vienna;</HI> with what
extraordinary Splendour and Magnificence
his Emba&s;&s;y appear'd there; as likewi&s;e,
what obliged his Maje&s;ty to return on a
&s;udden into <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> It is al&s;o &s;ufficient|ly
<PB N="65" REF="40">
known to you, that he left <HI>Procofet
Bogdanovitz Wolnizin,</HI> as his Amba&s;&s;adour
and Plenipotentiary for the Negotiation of
Peace to be &s;et on foot upon the Fron|tiers
of <HI>Hungary,</HI> betwixt the Confederate
Princes and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty took the way of <HI>Poland</HI> in
his Return homewards, where he had an
Interview, not far from <HI>Lembergh,</HI> with his
pre&s;ent <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, who a&s;&s;ured him,
That he was re&s;olved to continue the
War again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> unle&s;s Peace might
be obtained upon very good Conditions,
and e&s;pecially by the Surrender of <HI>Ca|minieck</HI>
to the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever the i&s;&s;ue of this Treaty
may be, you will ea&s;ily grant me, if
you will be plea&s;ed to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly
upon what I have told you before, That,
&s;uppo&s;ing the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> &s;hould not
be comprehended in the &s;aid Peace, he is
alone capable of waging War again&s;t the
<HI>Turks,</HI> and not without hopes of Succe&s;s
on his &s;ide. For his Frontiers being &s;o
well provided and &s;trengthned with good
Fortifications on that &s;ide where the
<HI>Turks</HI> mu&s;t attack him; he has no more
to do, than to be upon the Defen&s;ive by
Land, and in the mean while to attack them
briskly at Sea. And it is more than pro|bable,
That this is the Grand De&s;ign of
this Prince, who &s;eems to have taken
&s;uch &s;ure Mea&s;ures in re&s;pect to the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of his Maritime Affairs, that
there is all the Rea&s;on in the World to
<PB N="66" REF="41">
believe, that he will always Triumph
over the <HI>Turks</HI> at Sea, who never did any
thing Memorable in that Se'rvice; and
who according to all outward Appear|ance,
are le&s;s in a Condition than ever
to &s;ignalize them&s;elves upon the Watery
Element at a time, when their Empire
appears in a declining State.</P>
<P>I will leave it to your own Judg|ment,
whether it would not &s;hake the
very Foundation of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Monarchy,
con&s;idering its pre&s;ent tottering Conditi|on,
if the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> &s;hould cha&s;e the
<HI>Turks</HI> out of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and make
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their Ports on the&s;e
Coa&s;ts, which from the City of <HI>Caffa,</HI> as
far as to the mouth of the <HI>Bory&s;thenes,</HI>
mu&s;t thereby be expo&s;ed to the Mercy
of the <HI>Mu&s;covites?</HI> And it is not im|probable
that <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf might
be hardly put to it, or at lea&s;t run the
Hazzard of being laid in A&s;hes by a
Bombardment. What would in &s;uch a
ca&s;e, become of the <HI>Crim-Tartary,</HI> which
being already enclo&s;ed on all &s;ides by a
good number of &s;trong Forte&s;&s;es, mu&s;t of
nece&s;&s;ity fall, without making one Blow,
into the hands of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> if all
Commerce and Corre&s;pondence betwixt
the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;hould be
cut off, by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> becoming Ma|&s;ters
of the <HI>Black-Sea;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="41">
Be&s;ides, it is to be con&s;idered, that as
Places are attack'd now a-days, they have
only <HI>Precop</HI> and <HI>Caffa,</HI> which are in a
Condition to make &s;ome &s;lender Defence.</P>
<P>But, Sir, being unwilling to tire your
Patience with too long a Letter, I will
come to a Conclu&s;ion; I mu&s;t only repeat
to you once more, what I have intimat|ed
before, That it was the greate&s;t O|ver-&s;ight
the <HI>Turks</HI> could be guilty of, not
to take all the imaginable Precautions a|gain&s;t
the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> becoming Ma&s;ters
of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> who thereby have opened them|&s;elves
the way into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> over
which the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire always claim'd
the Sovereignty in a mo&s;t peculiar man|ner.
To make &s;ome Amends for &s;o un|pardonable
an Error, the mo&s;t likely
means they have left, &s;eems to be, to con|clude
an everla&s;ting Peace with the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI>
thereby to lull them a&s;leep, that
they may not lay hold of this Opportuni|ty
of rendring them&s;elves redoubtable in
the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port might thus reap a
con&s;iderable Advantage by the Commerce
with <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> by e&s;tabli&s;hing certain Duties
to be paid for the pa&s;&s;age of Ships through
the Channel leading to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in
the &s;ame manner as it is practi&s;ed in
<HI>Denmark,</HI> where the King of that Name,
receives Cu&s;toms of the Ships that pa&s;s
and repa&s;s the <HI>Sound,</HI> in their going to,
and coming from the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="42">
This appears to me the only mo&s;t pro|bable
Means, to plunge them out of that
Misfortune which they have drawn upon
them&s;elves by their own Neglect, it being
allow'd by all that have any in&s;ight into
the pre&s;ent State of Affairs in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
That the pre&s;ent Czar <HI>Peter Alexiovitz,</HI>
has taken a firm Re&s;olution, not to re&s;t
&s;atisfied, till he has opened this Pa&s;&s;age
in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a free Commerce
with foreign Nations, and to encourage
them to come into his Ports near the <HI>Pa|lus
Meotis.</HI></P>
<P>This, Sir, is the pre&s;ent Condition of
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire, which was formerly
look'd upon as mo&s;t barbarous, but which
now bids fair for the Priority with any in
<HI>Europe,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Encrea&s;e of its
Commerce with mo&s;t Nations of the
World, by the indefatigable Vigilancy of
their pre&s;ent Monarch, who being &s;carce
28 Years of Age; what is it that may
not be expected from &s;o Great a Prince,
if God plea&s;es to ble&s;s him with a long
Life.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Wolga</HI> is above five hundred
Leagues (to reckon from its fir&s;t Spring)
to the Canal, by which it is join'd with the
River <HI>Don,</HI> and this River, from thence
to the City of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> four hundred Leagues
more, fit for Ships of good Burthen,
and from the Canal of Communication
betwixt the&s;e two noble Rivers, there is
two hundred Leagues di&s;tance to <HI>A&s;oph</HI>
upon a &s;traight Line, all extream good
<PB N="69" REF="42">
Grounds; <HI>A&s;oph</HI> and <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> being &s;itu|tuate
under the mo&s;t happy Climate in
the World. The We&s;tern &s;ide of the
River <HI>Wolga</HI> is very well inhabited al|ready,
and there is no great que&s;tion,
but that the Conveniency of Commerce,
and Plenty of the Country, will &s;oon
invite &s;ome of the Neighbouring vaga|bond
<HI>Tartars</HI> to follow the foot&s;teps of
other more civiliz'd Nations, when once
they are made &s;en&s;ible of the Benefit of
an Indu&s;trious and &s;ettled Life. This
is &s;ufficiently verified by the Example of
many of the <HI>A&s;iatick Tartars,</HI> who have
by degrees abandoned their vagabond and
idle Life, and follow'd their Prince into
<HI>China,</HI> where they are become Wealthy
by their Traffick; the like may be &s;aid
of many of the <HI>Crim-Tartars,</HI> tho&s;e of
<HI>A&s;tracan, Siberia, Dauria,</HI> and other
parts &s;ubject to the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>If we ca&s;t our eyes upon that Part of
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> whereabouts the Port of <HI>Arch-Angel</HI>
is, and con&s;ider, that not above an
Age ago the&s;e Patts were as little inhabi|ted
as any of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> being low Grounds,
and &s;ituate under a very cold Climate;
But &s;ince the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Commerce
in this Harbour, the Country all there|abouts
is very well &s;tock'd with Inha|bitants,
and many goodly Towns and
Villages.</P>
<P>In the Southern Parts of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the
Cities of <HI>Wologda, Jere&s;la, Ro&s;tof, Pere|&s;law,</HI>
and others owe all their Encrea&s;e of
<PB N="70" REF="43">
Wealth to traffick. Add to this the ad|vantage
of Commerce betwixt the <HI>Indies,
Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> by the way of the
<HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Lake or Sea; all which Commo|dities
may for the future be tran&s;ported
by the newly projected Canal betwixt
the two Rivers <HI>Wolga</HI> and <HI>Don,</HI> into all
Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> what immen&s;e Profit

conveyed into <HI>Mu&s;couy!</HI> which being al|ready
&s;o con&s;iderable for its va&s;t Extent

it being agreed on all hands, that as his
De&s;ign was to build the Frame of the

more &s;olid Foundation, than it was in for|mer
times, &s;o he judged nothing could
more conduce to obtain this Great End,
than if he &s;hould take this Opportunity,
of being inform'd in Per&s;on concerning
the&s;e Maxims, which have rendred &s;ome
of the <HI>European</HI> States, &s;o flouri&s;hing in
our Age,</P>
<P>For, whereas the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Monarchs u&s;ed
to make the Ignorance of their Subjects
the Main Foundation-&s;tone of their Au|thority;
&s;o it is obvious to every unbya&s;|&s;ed
Per&s;on, that his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty looks
upon the Improvements of all Arts and
Sciences, and the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a re|gular
Di&s;cipline, as the Main Pillars of
the Greatne&s;s of this Monarchy.</P>
<P>It was in the Pro&s;ecution of this Grand
De&s;ign he appear'd, though <HI>Incognito,</HI> in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and after having
&s;atisfy'd him&s;elf in tho&s;e Matters which
<PB N="77" REF="45">
were the Chief Subject of his Curio&s;ity,
he re&s;olved to vi&s;it likewi&s;e the Imperial
Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he arrived with
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Emba&s;&s;y, towards the latter
end of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce been a few days in this
City, when he received Letters from <HI>A|&s;oph,</HI>
That part of that Garri&s;on, to the
Number of betwixt &s;even and eight
Thou&s;and Men, having receiv'd Intelli|gence,
That the <HI>Tartars</HI> had put a great
Number of their be&s;t Hor&s;es in the cir|cumjacent
Pa&s;tures, under the Guard of
three thou&s;and Men, were marched out
again&s;t them, had defeated the Guard,
and brought near thirty thou&s;and Hor&s;es
into <HI>A&s;oph.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Letters were in a few olays after
follow'd by an Expre&s;s from&punc; <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
with an Account, That the Remainders
of the antient <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Guards (whom
they call <HI>Strelitzes</HI>) had Mutiny'd, un|der
Pretence of Want of Pay; and that
being join'd by &s;ome others, were mar|ched
towards <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> the Capital City
of the whole Empire, with an Intention
to Surprize and Ran&s;ack the Place. The
<HI>Strelitzes;</HI> who formerly might be compa|red
to the Jani&s;aries of the <HI>Turks,</HI> had
given &s;uch frequent proofs of their Bar|barity
and Cruelty again&s;t the Inhabitants
of this City, upon &s;uch like Occa&s;ions,
that many of them being terrified by &s;o
unexpected a Revolt in the Czar's Ab|&s;ence,
left their Habitations, and a gene|ral
<PB N="78" REF="46">
Con&s;ternation had &s;ei&s;ed the whole
Empire, as dreading the Effects of the
Fury of the&s;e In&s;olent Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Princes <HI>Loff Kerilvitz, Nariskin
Procorofskoi,</HI> and <HI>Boris Alexiovitz Gallizin,</HI>
who had the Supream Admini&s;tration of
the Government during the Czar's Ab&s;ence,
were not wanting in their Duty, to en|courage
the Inhabitants both by Words,
and their own Example; and that nothing
might be wanting on their &s;ide, to reduce
this rebellious Crew to their Duty, &s;ent
&s;ome of the Nobility, back'd by a good
number of Troops, to endeavour to ap|pea&s;e
their Fury; but they were &s;o far
from hearkning to the Propo&s;itions offered
them by the Deputies of the Governours,
that they fired at them, and forced them
to retire to the City.</P>
<P>Thus all fair means proving ineffectual,
General <HI>Gourdon</HI> was &s;ent out with a good
Body of faithful Troops, Commanded for
the mo&s;t part by foreign Officers, who

Attack'd, and totally Routed them, kil|ling
many of them upon the Spot, and

the due Reward of their Treachery.</P>
<P>The Czar being over-joyed at the Suc|ce&s;s

re&s;olved not only to &s;tay for &s;ome time at

&s;o long and dangerous a Journey; but
be&s;ides this, there may be alledged ano|ther,
having a peculiar Re&s;pect to the

all the Rea&s;on in the World to promi&s;e
them&s;elves the entire Conque&s;t of the
<HI>Crim-Tartary,</HI> and the <HI>Tartarian Penin&s;ula</HI>
it &s;elf, if the War &s;hould be carried on
but for two years longer by the Confede|rates
again&s;t the Infidels, there being no|thing
but the Cities of <HI>Precop, Crim</HI> and
<HI>Caffa,</HI> places of no great Strength, which
could make any con&s;iderable Re&s;i&s;tance,

they had already got firm footing, by the
Conque&s;t of the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Ka&s;ikermeen,</HI>
in the Year 1695, and the Submi&s;&s;ion of
many of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> upon the Frontiers,
to the Czar's Obedience. His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty, who from the beginning of his
War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> had had no le&s;s in
view than the reducing of the&s;e Places,
and making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
had, before his departure out of

Country, the Way through the <HI>Great-Tar|tary</HI>

thus till the Interview, which la&s;ted about
half an Hour, was pa&s;s'd.</P>

<P>I told you before, that &s;oon after his

into the People, that he had over-turn'd
the whole Frame of the Antient
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Government, by reducing the
Standing Forces of the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> to &s;o in|con&s;iderable
a Number, and depriving
Them of their mo&s;t antient Priviledges, in
lieu of which, he had &s;et over them a
great number of foreign Officers, who

over the Natives at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>That the Chief aim of his Journey in|to

pa&s;t all hopes of recovering their former
Priviledges and Dignity.</P>

coals, clamouring with great Zeal to their
Auditors, That their Religion was in mo&s;t
imminent Danger, by the Encouragement
given to Foreigners of another Religion,
who, as they were the In&s;truments of o|verturning
the antient Foundation of the
State, &s;o they would in time prove the
utter Ruine of their Religion.</P>
<P>To this it was added, That the Czar
being at pre&s;ent in far di&s;tant Countries,
they could not wi&s;h for a more &s;ea&s;onable
Opportunity to recover their Lo&s;s, by
putting the Government into the hands of
the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> which of Right be|longed
to her in the Czar's Ab&s;ence, and
which &s;he had managed with &s;o much
Dexterity during her Brother's Minority.</P>
<P>The&s;e In&s;inuations were &s;o prevailing
with many, that they had brought over to
their Party, not only the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> and
other Malecontents of the Nobility, who
were ready at all times to join again&s;t the
Czar, but al&s;o &s;ome of the Head of the

and among them the General that Com|manded
upon the Frontiers of <HI>Lithuania,</HI>
as likewi&s;e &s;ome Lords and Courtiers of the

upon as ab&s;olutely devoted to the Czar's

<P>I don't que&s;tion but that you will look
upon the&s;e Tran&s;actions of the Czar, as
favouring of too much Severity, both in
re&s;pect of the Number and Quality of

call to mind the reiterated Con&s;piracies,

Crown,
both again&s;t his Per&s;on and Government,
you will, I am apt to believe, be obliged
to own, that what was done upon this
Account by the Czar, was not an Effect
of his Natural Di&s;po&s;ition, which is in no
wi&s;e inclinable to Cruelty, but mu&s;t be
attributed to the pre&s;ent Urgency of the
Affairs of the State, which required, that
tho&s;e Members, who after all the Leni|tives
had been made u&s;e of in vain, to
allay their malignant Humours, were now
to be treated with Corro&s;ives, and &s;uch as
were quite degenerated into an incurable
Gangrene, mu&s;t be &s;eparated from the
re&s;t, by cutting off the infected Parts.</P>
<P>You cannot be ignorant that &s;ince his

been concluded with the <HI>Turks</HI> for 25
years, in re&s;pect of his Imperial Maje&s;ty

to the Conclu&s;ion of this Letter, to make
it apparent, that as the whole was tran&s;|acted
by his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Orders and
good liking, &s;o the &s;ame is founded upon
a mo&s;t &s;olid and refined Rea&s;ons of State,
on die &s;ide of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>I told you before, That the Czar of

City of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> &s;ituate &s;o near the <HI>Palus

as far as to the <HI>Bory&s;thenes</HI> it &s;elf,
had all the Rea&s;on in the World, to be de|&s;irous
of the Continuance of the War a|gain&s;t

the Chief Motives of his Journey to the

But his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty being made &s;uf|ficiently

Prejudice to their own Intere&s;t, could

Condition of the <HI>Turks</HI> in general,
it is mo&s;t evident, that the <HI>Ottomans</HI> lie

<P>It is furthermore to be con&s;idered, that
the <HI>Turks</HI> having hitherto look'd upon the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> as &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the

again&s;t them, their Fortre&s;&s;es and
Maritime Towns, though of the greate&s;t
Con&s;equence to them, in re&s;pect of main|taining
the Dominion of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
have been neglected; whereas by the Vigi|lancy
of his pre&s;ent <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Frontiers are in a better State
than any of his other Dominions, by the

upon &s;o good and firm a Foundation,
that the &s;ame is incomparably &s;uperior to
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet (which has been batter'd
&s;o often by the <HI>Venetians</HI> of late) both in
re&s;pect of number of Ships, and the good|ne&s;s

that Matters &s;hould remain among
all Parties in <HI>Statuo-quo,</HI> his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
had little pro&s;pect of obtaining thy Do|minion
over the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> or a free Com|merce
in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ports by a long Truce,
which would have given the <HI>Turks</HI> lei&s;ure
to recover Breath, and to &s;trengthen their
Fortre&s;&s;es and Maritime Places on that

in any wi&s;e a proportionable time requi|&s;ite

<P>That this is his Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty's de&s;ign,

va&s;t Preparations at Sea, being informed
from very good hands, that he has at <HI>Ve|roniza</HI>
only near fourty &s;tout Men of War,
ready to put to Sea, mo&s;t of which carry
betwixt fifty and &s;ixty Guns be&s;ides

able to oppo&s;e at this time again&s;t &s;uch a

of Opinion, that when, by the intended&punc;
Canal betwixt the two Rivers, <HI>Wolga</HI> and

Conveniency extend his Conque&s;ts that

has few good Ports, and that the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Territories are &s;eparated by
Land by va&s;t De&s;arts from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and
that there is a &s;trict Corre&s;pondence be|twixt

Rea&s;on why it may not be more rea&s;ona|bly

not by granting free Commerce to the

two Years Truce, prevent the Storm, his

War on his &s;ide, in reference to the va&s;t
di&s;tance of Frontiers, which are five
or &s;ix Months March from the City of
<HI>Mu&s;cow;</HI> whereas on the other hand, the
<HI>Chine&s;es</HI> &s;end their Supplies with much
more Ea&s;e, and infinite le&s;s Charge, by
rea&s;on of the nearne&s;s of the <HI>Ea&s;tern-Tar|tars,</HI>
their Subjects; and the <HI>Czar</HI> having
at the &s;ame time a &s;trong Inclination to
come to a Rupture with the <HI>Turks,</HI> at a
<PB N="102" REF="58">
Juncture when their Affairs were but in
an ill po&s;ture, re&s;olved to come to an Ac|commodation
with the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t meeting of the Amba&s;&s;adours
of the&s;e two Potent Empires upon the
Frontiers near <HI>Albazin,</HI> proved un&s;ucce&s;s|ful,
the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> according to their an|tient
Cu&s;toms; in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;ome Cere|monies,
that would not in any wi&s;e be
granted by the <HI>Mu&s;eovites;</HI> But the &s;e|cond
Treaty &s;ucceeded according to wi&s;h,
the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> being forced to abate of their
Pride, and to Treat the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adours
from that time, with all the
Re&s;pect due to their Character.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> having not till very
lately applied them&s;elves to the Sea, it is
no great wonder, if they have not neg|lected
the Pa&s;&s;age by Water into <HI>China,</HI>
by the Way of the Rivers <HI>Oby, Gene&s;&s;ai,</HI>
and <HI>Yamour;</HI> and in lieu thereof, have
left nothing unattempted to open their
Pa&s;&s;age thither by Land. 'Tis true, the
Heaps of Ice, which for the greate&s;t part
of the Year are to be met with at the En|trance
of the River <HI>Oby,</HI> the many Water|falls
of the River <HI>Gene&s;&s;ai,</HI> and the Bul|ru&s;hes
which choak almo&s;t up the mouth
of the River <HI>Yamour,</HI> are Ob&s;tacles,
which though they might have been &s;ur|mounted
by indu&s;trious and expert. Sea|men,
yet were &s;o terrifying to the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI>
as to bereave them of all hopes of
Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="58">
And to confe&s;s the Truth, con&s;idering
the Method u&s;ed by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Merchants
and <HI>Caravans,</HI> and the good Order taken
for their convenient Pa&s;&s;ge through the&s;e
Parts, the &s;ame contribute not a little to|wards
mitigating both the Trouble and
Charge of &s;o long a Journey.</P>
<P>They &s;et forward mo&s;t commonly
from the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> in <HI>February,</HI>
when the Snow being well beaten, they
travel in nineteen or twenty days, as far
as <HI>Tobolskoy,</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Siberia,</HI>
eight hundred <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles di|&s;tant
from the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow.</HI> If it
happens to thaw about that time (which
is very &s;eldom) they take the conveni|ency
of the Rivers on this and the other
&s;ide of the River <HI>Oby,</HI> by which means
they cro&s;s the Country till they come
to the <HI>O&s;tiakoi,</HI> the fir&s;t of the <HI>Ea&s;tern-Tartars,</HI>
Subject to the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI>
But if the Fro&s;t continue, they go on by
Land the &s;ame way, where they change
their Hor&s;es for <HI>Renes</HI> or <HI>Rain-deers,</HI>
which carry them with incredible &s;wift|ne&s;s
over the Snow and Ice to the City
of <HI>Gene&s;&s;ai,</HI> built by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> upon
the River of the fame Name, for the con|veniency
of their Merchants traveling
in tho&s;e Parts; Here it is they take Ve&s;|&s;els
which carry them upon the Rivers
<HI>Tongu&s;i</HI> and <HI>Augara,</HI> again&s;t the Stream,
to the Lake of <HI>Baikala.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="59">
From this Lake, they either take
Shipping upon the River <HI>Schelinga,</HI> as
far as to a City of the &s;ame Name,
owing likewi&s;e its foundation to the
<HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> or el&s;e proceed in their
Way by Land, immediately after they
have cro&s;s'd the beforementioned Lake,
through the Country of the <HI>Mongul Tar|tars,</HI>
who readily furni&s;h them with
Mules and Dromedaries, to the Con|fines
of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>But for the better under&s;tanding of
this Famous Pa&s;&s;age by Land, I will
conclude this Letter with giving you
the be&s;t Account I could get, of &s;e|veral

Road lately taken by &s;everal Emba&s;&s;y's

&s;ixty Miles from the la&s;t, and &s;o

they come to the River <HI>Lu&s;owa,</HI>
