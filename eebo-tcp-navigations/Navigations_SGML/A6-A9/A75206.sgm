<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce the taking of <HI>Beaumont,</HI> by a Detachment of our Army, the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> has employed all his skill to Repo&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of that place, by rea&s;on of its Advantagious Situation, but hitherto he has been fru&s;trated in all his De&s;igns. Be|tween the 9th and 10th he broke up, with his Camp, in hopes to &s;urprize the <HI>Count van der Lippe,</HI> who had put a &s;trong Garri&s;on into that place: But his Maje&s;ty having timely Notice of his De&s;ign; gave immediately Orders to our Army to March, which we did ac|cordingly the 10th in the Afternoon, and about 5 a Clock at Night, we came within Sight of the Enemy, we Marched directly towards him; And about Night our whole Army was ranged in order of Bat|tel, within a Cannon Shot of the <HI>French.</HI> They had po&s;ted them&s;elves upon the Hills of <HI>Faubrechies,</HI> and we had <HI>Beaumont</HI> in the mid&s;t of our Line. The whole Night was &s;pent in laying Bridges over a Water and Mora&s;s that was between us and the Enemy, &s;ome of our Cannons were Planted, and we intended to pa&s;s the Bridges by break of Day, and to Attack the Enemy, but his Maje&s;ty being advanced within a Mu&s;quet Shot of the Enemy, and taken a full view of the Ground, it was found that there was not Room enough to Range four Regiments in order of Battle; There being nothing but Defilees on all &s;ides, and that Con&s;equently it was impo&s;&s;ible to Attack the Enemy, without hazarding our whole Camp. We remain'd neverthele&s;s in order of Battle, to try if the Enemy would give him&s;elf the Trouble to come half way; But they keeping them&s;elves very clo&s;e according to their u&s;ual manner, we returned in the &s;ight of the Enemy. It was expect|ed they would fall into our Reer: Having &s;o fair an opportunity for it; But not a Man of theirs &s;tirr'd, and we arrived &s;afely into our old Camp at Court. Since this time orders have been &s;ent to the Bailiffs and Majors to have eigtheen thou&s;and Pioneers ready to March, with|in three days time, and this is without doubt to execute &s;ome con&s;i|derable Enterpri&s;e. We have indeed not been able as yet to provoke
<PB N="2" REF="2">our Enemy to a Pitch-Battel, nor have we taken any great Fortre&s;&s;es; But if under&s;tanding Men will &s;oberly con&s;ider that his Maje&s;ty has forc'd the <HI>French,</HI> to entertain for &s;o Con&s;iderable a time, Two va&s;t Armys within their own Territories, that &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the <HI>French</HI> Kings Dominions, that enabled his Forces to make &s;uch great Excur&s;ions into the remaining <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Provinces, are now de&s;troyed and laid wa&s;t, And that in the mean time, there is time given to the Subjects of his Catholick Maje&s;ty quietly to bring in their Harve&s;t, and con&s;equently to fill the Magazins with Provi&s;ions for the next Campaign, I &s;ay they that con&s;ider all this, will certainly agree that the King has done very much, and more than rea&s;onably could be expected, altho' it &s;hould not come to any con&s;iderable Action this year, which as yet we have great rea&s;on to hope, for the la&s;t News we had out of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Piedmont</HI> entertain us in our hopes of great Succe&s;s on that &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Montmelian</HI> makes a vigorous defence, though it has been formally Be&s;ieged, and the Trenches opened eight days ago. <HI>Catinat</HI> with the main Body retreats towards <HI>Pignerol,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> is al|ways at his heels. Upon their Retreat to <HI>Piobes,</HI> Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> fell in|to his Rear with 500 Hor&s;e, and cut entirely off three Squadrons of Hor&s;e, and a Troop of Carbines of the Enemy, but the Enemy, being reinforced, the Prince did retreat, and had certainly lo&s;t his life, in ca&s;e a <HI>German</HI> had not killed a <HI>French</HI> Dragoon that was ju&s;t going to &s;hoot the Prince. In the mean time, the <HI>French</HI> carry all their provi&s;ions out of that Country into <HI>Dauphine,</HI> which is a certain &s;ign that they have but little hopes to maintain them&s;elves in <HI>Savoy.</HI> The three <HI>German</HI> Generals <HI>Caraffa, Palfi,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> are alrerdy arrived at <HI>Turin,</HI> and his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is expected there him&s;elf within few days, he having taken the Po&s;t at <HI>Munichen, Augu&s;t</HI> the 10th. <HI>New-&s;tile,</HI> Be&s;ides the <HI>German</HI> Succors has all pa&s;t through the Dutchy of <HI>Milain</HI> from whence we have received this following Li&s;t,
