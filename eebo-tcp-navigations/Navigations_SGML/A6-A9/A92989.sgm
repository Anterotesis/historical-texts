<HEAD>Severall Occurrences, touching the fur|ther Proceedings of the SCOTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THis morning we received Intelli|gence, that the King of <HI>Scots</HI> em|barqued him&s;elf on Sunday the &s;ixth in&s;tant, but upon his going aboard, a great &s;torm aro&s;e (which many conjecture to be ominous) The Convoy that is to guard him, is &s;aid to be 7 &s;hips of War, carrying in all about 140 Guns, and man'd with about 500 men, which were de&s;ign'd to meet the <HI>East India</HI> fleet, that are now co|ming to <HI>Holland,</HI> but the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> prevailed with the States, for them to tran&s;port him into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which otherwi&s;e might have been retarded; for <HI>Van Trump</HI> (the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral) &s;eemed unwilling to undertake the Voyage, having other employments; and being &s;olicited (by the young King) for accom|modation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he po&s;itively declared; <HI>That he was a &s;worn &s;ervant to the States of</HI> Holland, <HI>and could
<PB N="2" REF="3">not act or do any thing, without their permi&s;&s;ion or grant, and therefore humbly de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, in not an&s;wer|ing him with a return, &s;utable to his de&s;ire, &amp;c.</HI> As for the <HI>Scots</HI> proceedings, it is the general talk, and daily di&s;cours of mo&s;t in the&s;e parts; but their re&s;ults are kept extream &s;ecret, as in reference to the making a War with <HI>England:</HI> Some report they will make no war for him, till they &s;ee how he proves; and whe|ther he be worth the engaging &s;o deeply for or not: but it's more like, till they &s;ee what forces he can pro|cure, to make &s;ome diver&s;ion; by invading you by &s;ea, in &s;everal places at once. And though you may perhaps think it &s;omething improbable, you &s;hould be invaded at &s;ea, and that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to pro|vide a Navy, either &s;o &s;ecretly as you &s;hould not know it, or &s;o great as you &s;hall not be able to deal with it; they are of another minde, and give out that they have potent numbers in &s;everal parts, and are not without hope of a port or gari&s;on, in the We&s;t or in <HI>Kent</HI> (ther|fore look well to them) where a few &s;hall land at fir&s;t, and the young titular-Kings party, will flock to them in multitudes; and this (as they &s;ay) will draw your forces to one place, till they &s;hall have opportunity to land more in another; and as &s;oon as the&s;e di&s;tractions are among you, then the <HI>Scots</HI> (like a &s;warm of Lo|cu&s;ts) to come in upon you (as one man) to make fertile <HI>England</HI> as mi&s;erable by war, as their own coun|try is without it: and to the end, that they may ob|tain the mo&s;t ea&s;ie and facile way, for the carrying on of this de&s;igne, they have prevailed with General <HI>Wal|demar</HI> (the King of <HI>Denmark's</HI> brother) to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; al&s;o General <HI>Carp</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>German</HI> Command|ers, have agreed with the Prince, to &s;erve him for no|thing
<PB N="3" REF="3">in <HI>England,</HI> and that they will have no pay, how long &s;oever the war &s;hall la&s;t, provided, that they may make booty of what ever &s;hall come in their way: It may very well be doubted, whether their rapinous fingers will be able to di&s;tingui&s;h, between Cavaliers goods, and tho&s;e of Pre&s;bytery or Sectary (e&s;pecially if they &s;hould be mo&s;t valuable;) and divers of the Duke of <HI>Lorains</HI> men have undertaken the like, who are pretty skilful in this art, only they de&s;ire &s;ome advance money, which (we hear) the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> will furni&s;h them with. This is the evil that threat|ens you, &s;pecial care had therefore need to be taken; 'tis very facile to prevent dangers fore-knowing of them: Therefore begin to act &s;trenuou&s;ly and beware you be not deluded by a <HI>beaten</HI> fawning <HI>Spaniel.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Digby's</HI> Secretary is lately arrived here from the I&s;le of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> who reports; That the Duke of <HI>York</HI> pa&s;&s;eth his time very merily in that <HI>I&s;land,</HI> and in continuall exerci&s;e, and de&s;ires to &s;ee the War be|gin this Summer, that he might &s;erve his brother in the head of the <HI>Scots;</HI> of which his de&s;ire, he hath writ|ten to the <HI>Queen</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> who was very well plea&s;ed with it, and accounted it a very honourable de&s;igne. But Sir <HI>George Cartwright</HI> (the Governour) and the L. <HI>Hopton,</HI> do not like that he &s;hould hazard him&s;elf, and do what in them lies, to alter his minde. And it is fur|ther reported by the &s;aid Secretary, that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> will not engage with the <HI>Scots,</HI> who &s;aith they are a perfidious people, who&s;e hearts harbour nothing but deceit. Their bloudy proceedings again&s;t <HI>Mon|tro&s;s, Spotsford, &amp;c.</HI> hath quite turned the tide here, and tho&s;e Officers de&s;igned for that &s;ervice, will not engage with them.</P>

<P>By an Expre&s;s from the City of <HI>Madrid</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> we are advertized of the bruti&s;h and barbarous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of that hone&s;t and ingenuous Gentleman, Ma&s;ter <HI>A&s;cram,</HI> Re&s;ident for the Common wealth of <HI>England</HI> with his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Spain;</HI> which bloudy Tragedy, was acted by &s;ome de&s;perate per&s;ons, as followeth; <HI>viz.</HI> Upon his landing at the Port of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> ha|ving intelligence of divers threats uttered again&s;t him, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colonel with a guard of 200 Hor&s;e, was ap|pointed for his Convoy, by whom he was conduct|ed to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where he arrived the fifth of this Mo|neth, and that night lodged unfortunatly in a com|mon Inn, intending the next day to be better provi|ded. The day following, Ma&s;ter <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> (his Steward) went to &s;eek a hou&s;e, and having found one very con|venient, agreed for it; In the mean time, it happened as Mr. <HI>A&s;cram</HI> and one Signeur <HI>Riba</HI> (his Interpreter) &s;ate alone at dinner, only with one &s;ervant attending them, the murtherers knocked at door, and pretend|ing to be friends, ea&s;ily got acce&s;&s;e; there was &s;ix of them in number, three being habited like Merchants, the other like &s;ouldiers: Upon their approach, Mr. <HI>A&s;cram</HI> ro&s;e from the Table to &s;alute them, but the foremo&s;t laid hold on his hair, and returned the &s;alu|tation of <HI>Joab,</HI> &s;tabbing him into the head; which his Interpreter perceiving, endevoured to e&s;cape, but was li&s;tewi&s;e &s;tabbed in the Belly, and they both fell immediatly. The A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who po&s;t|ed for refuge to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors, but he ab|horring the fact, denied them entrance, &s;o that they were con&s;trained to take Sanctuary in the next Church; and being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued (by command and Proclamation from the King of <HI>Spain</HI>) five of them
<PB N="5" REF="4">are laid in pri&s;on to be made exemplary, and one e&s;ca|ped. This execrable fact (with that of <HI>Dori&s;laus</HI>) ren|ders that party odious to all Nations.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe young King is expected within a day or two, (as many give out) but the people are divided, and the meaner &s;ort begin to &s;ee what &s;lavery they live in under the great Laurds, &s;o that there is great probability they may in time &s;hake off tho&s;e &s;hackles. Yet notwith&s;tanding, the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> have publi&s;hed an Act for the rai&s;ing of every fourth man; A Copy whereof followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The States of Parliament now convened, taking in|to con&s;ideration the good and &s;ervice of the Kingdom, and Shires thereof, they Ordered the Committees of War of every &s;everal Shire of the Kingdom, to make new rolls of all the &s;en&s;ible per&s;ons, within each of their &s;everal Shires, and to cau&s;e the fourth man of the whole number of their &s;en&s;ible per&s;ons, to be trained, armed, and formed in Companies, and made ready upon all occa&s;ions for the publike &s;ervice, and good of the Kingdom and Shires, according to the rules and Acts formerly &s;et down. And the E&s;tates declare, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;hall be inrolled, as the fourth man in the &s;everall Shires, by vertue of this Act, to the effect afore&s;aid, &s;hall no ways be employed
<PB N="6" REF="5">for recruiting of former Regiments; And ordains the Shires to have the nomination and Election of the Of|ficers of their &s;everall Companies, and Regiments to be made up of the fourth man in the &s;aid Shires.</P>
<P>Which nomination and Election, the E&s;tate Or|dains the Committees of War, of the &s;everal Shires to repre&s;ent to the Committee of the E&s;tates of Parlia|ment, to whom the Parliament hereby gives power to allow or di&s;allow of the &s;ame nomination and Ele|ction, as the Committee &s;hall think fit, and to place others for &s;uch as they &s;hall not allow, for the good of the publike &s;ervice: And the E&s;tates do further declare, that this pre&s;ent Act is always without pre|judice to any former Acts, made for the putting of the Kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence, and ordaining all betwixt &s;ixty and &s;ixteen, to be trained and armed.</P>
