<HEAD><HI>A VOYAGE TO The Coa&s;ts of</HI> Africk <HI>called GUINEE.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>With a De&s;cription of the &s;everal Countries, Fa&s;hions, and Manners of the People, the Fruit and Com|modities of tho&s;e parts, with the Trade and Commerce they afford.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africk,</HI> commonly called <HI>Guinee,</HI> comprehen|ing a Tract of ground of &s;even hundred Leagues, from <HI>Cap-verd</HI> in the fourteenth degree of Nor|thern
<PB N="2" REF="6"> latitude, and nintieth degree of longitude Ea&s;t: to <HI>Cape Gon&s;al|vo</HI> in the fir&s;t degree of Southern la|titude and 29 and a half of Ea&s;tern longitude, are at pre&s;ent &s;o little fre|quented by the French (and all from an opinion they have taken up of the Malignity of the air) that it cannot (without great &s;ence and reluctancy) be con&s;ider'd how long, and how unhappily they have been de&s;erted by them, and left as a prey to all other Nations, without re|&s;erving &s;o much as the lea&s;t &s;hare in the mo&s;t advantagious Com|merce they afford.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s (having the heart and pa&s;&s;ions of a Frenchman) I could not ob&s;erve without great re|gret, the cunning, and artifice, wherewith the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Hollan|der,</HI> and the <HI>Dane</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;t us of the pernitiou&s;ne&s;s of the air, and the unwhol&s;omne&s;s of the place,
<PB N="3" REF="6"> and that with &s;o much &s;ubtilty, they had almo&s;t per&s;waded us out of the whole country, and to have given up tho&s;e few places which are &s;till in our power: a practice of that Moment, and importance to them all, that from their traffique upon the&s;e coa&s;ts alone (would they be ingenious and confe&s;s) they mu&s;t acknowledg they derive their mo&s;t con&s;iderable profit and advantage.</P>
<P>And indeed what Frenchman is their in the world &s;o &s;tupid and im|penitrable, that can behold &s;everal Bays along the&s;e coa&s;ts, (by the in|habitants called <HI>Bays de France</HI>) and &s;everal Towns (as <HI>Petit Diep</HI> and o|thers) declaring at this day the Ge|nealogy of their founders, &s;o intire|ly abandon'd by his countrymen, that there is nothing remaining there now but their name, and an indeliable de&s;ire in the natives, that they would conquer them again;
<PB N="4" REF="7"> what Frenchman I &s;ay can con&s;i|der this without remor&s;e, or re|member it without being affected.</P>
<P>True it is, in the time of the ci|vil wars wherewith it pleas'd God to afflict the Kingdome of <HI>France</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry le grand,</HI> our expul&s;ion in tho&s;e parts was com|pleated, for having no lei&s;ure to re|inforce &s;uch garri&s;ons as we had there from the time of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Eleventh, we were forc'd out of them all and con&s;train'd to yeild po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Portugais,</HI> who at that time like an inundation over|whelm'd all we had formerly gain|ed upon the <HI>Golden Coa&s;t,</HI> and for better &s;ecurity of their conque&s;ts, built a Ca&s;tle called <HI>St. George de la Mine,</HI> of which I &s;hall give a more ample di&s;cription hereafter.</P>
<P>Yet, as an argument that our in|tere&s;t was con&s;iderable there once, and that our magnificence was &s;uit|able
<PB N="5" REF="7"> to our intere&s;t: it is worthy ob&s;ervation, that at this very day the <HI>Dutch</HI> make u&s;e of a fair Church built formerly by the <HI>French,</HI> &s;till adorned with our Monuments and Arms, and the principal Battery they have towards the &s;ea, is &s;till by the Natives them&s;elves called <HI>la batterie de France.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts we had once the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Akara, Carmentin, Cape-cor&s;e</HI> and <HI>Takorai,</HI> at which la&s;t the <HI>Sweeds</HI> rais'd a new Fort &s;ince that, and upon the ruines of ours, but their late wars in <HI>Germany,</HI> (like our wars in <HI>France</HI>) having caus'd it to be neglected, and been an occa&s;ion of interrupting its &s;up|plies, it is demolli&s;h'd as well as ours, and hath nothing left now but rubbi&s;h, to &s;hew that ever it was there.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, we have &s;uffered the Hollander to incroach upon us in
<PB N="6" REF="8"> our days, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of our Plantation at <HI>Commendo,</HI> a Town &s;ome two leagues di&s;tance from the <HI>Cha&s;teau de la Mine,</HI> but they were glad to attend the death of two Frenchmen who had lived there along time, built a fair hou&s;e (of which there is nothing now &s;tanding but the walls) and com|ported them&s;elves with that candor and integrity to the Natives, that they gain'd the affections of them all, and have left &s;uch a perfume and reputation of the French be|hind them, the <HI>Moores</HI> do glory in being call'd by that name, and will &s;till beat their drums after the mode of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Three Months in the year, the aire of this Country is dangerous, and no more, yet &s;o little then, that with the lea&s;t providence and mo|deration one may pre&s;erve him&s;elf as well as in <HI>France,</HI> and perhaps
<PB N="7" REF="8"> better, becau&s;e we have &s;everal di|&s;ea&s;es which are familiar in <HI>Europe,</HI> that are utterly unknown in this Country.</P>
<P>But the truth is, this is but pre|tence, and the collu&s;ion of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to put that into our heads, that &s;ee|ing our commerce declining in tho&s;e parts, they might not onely eradicate all our thoughts of reco|vering it again, but all our regret and concernment for the lo&s;s of it, and they them&s;elves go quietly a|way with the commerce of &s;o many Kingdoms, which is &s;o prodigiou&s;|ly rich, I &s;hall only touch upon it <HI>in tran&s;itu,</HI> and not tell what I &s;aw my &s;elf lea&s;t it &s;hould &s;eem to be incredible.</P>
<P>Only this I &s;hall be bold to offer to the con&s;ideration of the world, whether it is probable the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> (who are a people &s;o ardently devoted to their intere&s;t and advan|tage,
<PB N="8" REF="9"> that there is &s;carce any body but knows it) would upon occa&s;ion of &s;urpri&s;ing the <HI>Fort</HI> at <HI>Cormentin</HI> upon the Golden Coa&s;t which was formerly theirs, have ventured upon the la&s;t war with <HI>England,</HI> had not their profits upon tho&s;e coa&s;ts been more then ordinarily con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>And indeed &s;o &s;weet was their trade there, and of that con&s;equence and importance they would never have endured either <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dane</HI> among&s;t them, had not the Natives compelled them.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance I &s;hall give in the ill u&s;age we receiv'd from <HI>the Heer Walkenbourg</HI> their General at the <HI>Mine,</HI> at a time too when we were in &s;o &s;trict alliance with them, that we had e&s;pous'd their quarrel, and made their Enemies our own, will I doubt not be &s;ufficient to demon|&s;trate, that there is nothing &s;o Bar|barous, or inho&s;pitable, they will
<PB N="9" REF="9"> not act for their profit, and to ex|clude the world from the notion of a Trade that would alone maintain the Grandeur of their State, were they ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the&s;e coa&s;ts without any competitors.</P>
<P>That the Genius and Humour of the <HI>Mores</HI> is more &s;u&s;ceptible of the <HI>French,</HI> then any other Nation, is manife&s;t by the de&s;igns all Forreign|ers have lay'd to keep us from thence: they know very well &s;hould our commerce be readmitted, theirs would be lo&s;t irrecoverably, and we &s;hould ingro&s;s the va&s;t quantities of Ivory and Gold-&s;and, which comes yearly from thence: be&s;ides the be|nefit of the Nigroes which are tran|&s;ported for Slaves into <HI>America;</HI> and contribute exceedingly to the profit of tho&s;e plantations.</P>
<P>Nor ought any difficulty in the Voyage, be able to di&s;courage us, &s;eeing when once arrived at the <HI>Ca|naries,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10"> the wind &s;erves always ve|ry well, no tempe&s;ts, no &s;torms, and ankorage is every where &s;o good, that an ankor of nine or ten inches, will hold a Ve&s;&s;el of 400 Tun.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Daliez Seigneur Martel</HI> being imployed into the&s;e parts by the <HI>We&s;t-Indy</HI> Company at <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;etting out from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in a new Ship of four hundred Tun, (called the <HI>Europe</HI>) took me along with him in the quality of his con|trouler for that Voyage.</P>
<P>On St. <HI>Mathews</HI> Eve, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty &s;ix, I departed from <HI>Paris</HI> in order to my imployment, and arrived at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> the Saturday after, the next night pa&s;&s;ing to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Roterdam,</HI> I came &s;afely to <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> on the 13th of <HI>September</HI> where having &s;pent &s;ome weeks with the re&s;t of our Officers in frait|ing our Ship, I departed with the <PB N="11" REF="10"> <HI>Heer Vante&s;ck,</HI> the <HI>Heer Willembourg</HI> (our Captain,) the <HI>Heer Vander|berg,</HI> and <HI>Moun&s;ieur Mathews</HI> (our Secretary) for the <HI>Texel.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning we went a|board, and on the 13 of <HI>November</HI> with a fair wind we &s;et &s;ail, &s;teer|ing our cour&s;e &s;outh &s;outh we&s;t; we gave the <HI>Fort</HI> of the <HI>Texel</HI> three guns, and then put out the colours of <HI>Ostend</HI> to prevent being &s;topt, there having been an expre&s;s prohi|bition for any <HI>Hollander</HI> to &s;erve any forreigner in tho&s;e parts upon pain of death, let the pretence be what it would.</P>
<P>Having di&s;mi&s;t our Pilot which conducted us to &s;ea; by degrees, and the opportunity of a mi&s;t we pa&s;t thorough the Channel, and (e&s;cap|ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of whom we had great apprehen&s;ion) we came up at length to certain I&s;lands about &s;ome 20 leagues di&s;tance from the River of <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<P>In this place it &s;eems it is a cu|&s;tome among&s;t the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (and punctually ob&s;erved) to baptize &s;uch of their &s;eamen and pa&s;&s;engers as have never pa&s;t the Tropique or Line before, and if the Ve&s;&s;el have never made that Voyage before (as ours had never done) by the &s;ame cu&s;tome the Captain is to obliged to give the Seamen &s;ome certain bottles of Brandy to be merry, and drink his health with all, other|wi&s;e he forfeits.</P>
<P>The weather being fair, and we very much beholding to the benig|nity of the &s;un, all things were pre|pared, the Bell rung, and the Sea|men immediately upon the Deck, and having &s;lackned our Sails, they began the ceremony of Bapti&s;m as follows.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the Seamen who had made this Voyage before, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ed up|on the other, and tying their hands
<PB N="13" REF="11"> behind them, they took them one by one, and having fa&s;tned a Rope under their armpits, they puld them up to the yard of the main ma&s;t, from thence &s;oucing them into the water, and then drawing them out again three or four times, &s;omtimes they ducked them for the King of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;omtimes for the States General, and at la&s;t for the Officers of the Ship, and their wives if they had any, after which they gave them a gla&s;s of Sack, or a di&s;h of Brandy, and all were good friends.</P>
<P>The boys in the Ship were &s;tript to their &s;hirts, and put under a bas|ket, and had &s;even or eight buckets of water poured over their heads.</P>
<P>Nor were the Officers exempt, for after their pre&s;ents of drink to the Seamen, they were contented to &s;tand &s;till till they threw &s;ome little water upon their heads out of a gla&s;s or pot, which concluded the ceremony.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="12">
<P>This Chri&s;tning being over, we &s;et &s;ail again, and by the error of our Pilots, we pa&s;t by the <HI>Maderas,</HI> where we intended to have put in.</P>
<P>At length we di&s;covered a high foreland, and advanced within 4 leagues of it to di&s;cover what it was, after five hours coa&s;ting we found by our &s;ounding (the water being forty fathom) and the redne&s;s of the &s;and, that it was not the I&s;le of <HI>Palma</HI> (as we imagined) but that we were got as far as the Gulf <HI>de &s;ainte Croix</HI> neer the Cape <HI>Geer</HI> up|on the coa&s;ts of <HI>Moroque.</HI></P>
<P>Having pa&s;t the <HI>Canaries</HI> and the Cape <HI>de Bajador,</HI> we pa&s;t the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> on the 10 of <HI>De|cember,</HI> and on the 12 having pa&s;t the Cape <HI>Blanc,</HI> we came into 18 degrees of latitude, and by the be|nefit of a &s;outh ea&s;t wind we run a|long by the &s;hore till we came to the 16 degrees, at which time we
<PB N="15" REF="12"> began to de&s;cry the coa&s;ts of <HI>Africk</HI> and to ob&s;erve them &s;andy and low.</P>
<P>The 14 at &s;un-ri&s;ing we found our &s;elves at the mouth of the river of <HI>Senegal,</HI> about 15 degrees, where the wind falling, we endured a calm, &s;o as that day nor the night following, we made no progre&s;s at all.</P>
<P>On the 15th we di&s;cover'd <HI>Cap-Verd,</HI> which at a di&s;tance re&s;embled two Bre&s;ts, but in re&s;pect it was en|vironed with Rocks, and not ap|proachable without danger, we &s;teer'd to the North-We&s;t, and on the 16, we doubled the <HI>Cap</HI> in our pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Rio-Fre&s;co,</HI> a Town upon the coa&s;ts of <HI>Africk,</HI> about 6 leagues from the <HI>Cap;</HI> a place where they u&s;ually take in fre&s;h water, and &s;omtimes trade, but with little &s;ecu|rity, the <HI>Fort</HI> and I&s;land of <HI>Goure</HI> (which belongs to the <HI>Hollander</HI>) being too near.</P>

<HEAD>CAP-VERD.</HEAD>
<P>SO called from a perpetual ver|dure which embelli&s;hes it, is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t a|greeable places in the world. It is a Promontory which throws it &s;elf a long way from Ea&s;t to We&s;t into the Sea; the North part of it is Mountanous, and covered always with green Trees, its point to|wards the Ea&s;t, is about a Mile over: it is a Rock very &s;teep and &s;harp towards the Sea, which with great gentlene&s;s bathes and wa&s;hes the feet of it, after it has been bro|ken, and di&s;cu&s;t by &s;everal &s;maller, and conceal'd rocks that incompa&s;s it, and &s;eem to be plac'd there by nature, on no other purpo&s;e but to oppo&s;e them&s;elves (in the behalf of &s;o delicate a place) again&s;t the
<PB N="17" REF="13"> fury of &s;o impetuous an Element. The 2 points advancing like moun|tains, and making as it were a ver|dant terras or rampart walk betwixt them, yeilds a mo&s;t incomparable per&s;pective thorough the trees on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and is no le&s;s beauti|ful on the South, though the coun|try lies low, by rea&s;on of the Trees which one would think were plan|ted by a line, if he con&s;iders with what exactne&s;s and regularity they grow.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame wind which (being gentle) had indulg'd our curio&s;ity, and given us a grateful and com|pleat pro&s;pect of this Cape, remo|ved us almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly, and brought us to <HI>Goure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Goure</HI> is a little I&s;land about a League in circumference, and three Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Cap-Verd,</HI> 'tis &s;eparated from the <HI>Terra&s;irma</HI> by a little arm of the Sea, about half a
<PB N="18" REF="14"> League over. At pre&s;ent it belongs to the <HI>Hollander,</HI> who on a mountain on the we&s;t-&s;ide has built a Fort, on the Ea&s;t it is low, has a good Port on the South, and good Ankorage.</P>
<P>We &s;aluted the Fort with five pieces of Canon, and received as many from them; we gave them 3. more by way of thanks, and that they might not &s;eem to be behind us in civility, they return'd us one more, and &s;et up the <HI>Dutch</HI> Standard.</P>
<P>A while after the Governor &s;ent out his Boat to inquire what we were, and what news; he that com|manded it &s;pake very good <HI>French,</HI> and it fell to my &s;hare to entertain him a good while. Our di&s;cour&s;e was about <HI>Cap-Verd,</HI> and <HI>Le-Segnal,</HI> which he cry'd up to me as the mo&s;t plea&s;ant part of the world, and the be&s;t for trade, and told me, that at long run the French would carry it from every body.</P>

<P>After Dinner he return'd to the Fort, de&s;iring us to go on to <HI>Gambay</HI> where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had a &s;mall Fort with eight pieces of Canon plant|ed, and the Government worth 2000 <HI>l. per ann.</HI></P>

<P>After Dinner our Secretary was &s;ent on Shore to carry the <HI>Alcair,</HI> or Governor, his Pre&s;ents, (which were
<PB N="20" REF="15"> Knives, and Brandy) and to take a view of what Commodities they had there and to procure fre&s;h meat.</P>
<P>At his return, he told us the <HI>Alcair</HI> had receiv'd him very civilly in his own hou&s;e, which is built in the mid&s;t of &s;everal others, that he made him &s;it down by him upon a very neat Mat, and regal'd him with &s;uch Wine and Fruits as the Coun|trey did afford.</P>
<P>That as to Commodities, the coa&s;t was at pre&s;ent unfurni&s;h'd, but if we would have patience for a fortnight, he would give notice to the Mar|chants of the Country, who would doubtle&s;s &s;upply us, e&s;pecially &s;e|veral <HI>Portugals</HI> which they then had among&s;t them: and as to fre&s;h Vic|tuals he would furni&s;h us next day.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t our Notary was a &s;hore, there came a <HI>Canoe</HI> aboard us from the <HI>Alcair,</HI> but &s;o mann'd, as &s;urpri|zed me very much: they were ex|ceedingly

<P>They demanded what we were; we told them <HI>French:</HI> they ask'd if we were come to &s;tay, or had put in only for Provi&s;ions; we reply'd for Provi&s;ions, but we would return to continue; to which they an&s;wer'd <HI>Bon, Bon:</HI> the <HI>French</HI> are more worth than all the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>There came &s;everal other <HI>Canoes</HI> to us with great quantity of fi&s;h, which they barter'd for knives and &s;trong waters, which they fancy exceedingly.</P>
<P>That night we &s;tood to our arms, apprehending &s;ome attempt from <HI>Goure</HI> to &s;urpri&s;e us. The next mor|ning, the <HI>Alcair</HI> him&s;elf, called <HI>Ab|don&s;ech,</HI> came aboard us in our Shal|lop, accompany'd with his Offi|cers, and the principal of the Town.
<PB N="22" REF="16"> He was a per&s;on of about 35. or 40. years of age, well proportion'd, and under&s;tood his intere&s;t well e|nough.

<P>We made them &s;it and dine with us, after which they de&s;ir'd the Of|ficers of the Ve&s;&s;el that they would return thither and continue, which we promi&s;ing, they enter'd into a Contract of allyance, which was &s;ign'd and &s;eal'd on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>We ask'd them where their King

<P><HI>Rio-Fre&s;ca</HI> is a Town of about 200 hou&s;es, that it hath a conve|nient Harbour on the We&s;t-&s;ide of

<P>The Ea&s;t-&s;ide is covered with a Wood, thorow which I pa&s;t four or five hundred paces, and di&s;co|vered large fields beyond it, which my eye could not compa&s;s. This Wood con&s;i&s;ts of Palm-trees, and other very lofty Trees, which in <HI>Europe</HI> are unknown.</P>
<P>The aire (though the place be fourteen degrees on this &s;ide the Line) is as good and as warm, as any on the&s;e coa&s;ts; for which rea&s;on both women and men, go naked, on|ly a little linnen before, to cover their <HI>pudibunda,</HI> which the men doe not &s;cruple to laave off when they go to Sea.</P>

<P>They eat very little fle&s;h, though they have Oxen, Cows, Sheep, Goats, Kids, Hens, Pidgeons, a kind of Phe&s;ants, and &s;mall Birds in a|bundance; Their chief diet is Fi&s;h, as the <HI>Guilthead,</HI> the <HI>Shadfi&s;h,</HI> the

<P>The men of this place are very per&s;onable and well, not many of them <HI>Camous,</HI> and from hence it is they have the be&s;t &s;laves in <HI>Africk.</HI> The women and daughters are for the mo&s;t part very common, court|ing and &s;olliciting of Strangers by that time they are fourteen years old, and that in the mid&s;t of the &s;treets, &s;o great a kindne&s;s and in|clination they have for them.</P>

<P>THe next day by the benefit of the Tyde, we came to an an|chor in the River of <HI>Sierra-Leone;</HI> aboot noon the <HI>Mores</HI> came aboard us to conduct us into the <HI>Bay de France,</HI> which is the 4th from <HI>Cap-Ledo</HI> at the mouth of the River.</P>
<P>At &s;ix fathom deep, low water, we came to an anchor within mu&s;quet &s;hot of the fountain, where we took in fre&s;h water, and having landed, we went that night to &s;upper upon the banks of it, where we killed a Goat which came thither to drink, and found the water more plea&s;ant and delicious (in re&s;pect of our thir&s;t) then the be&s;t of our Wines.</P>
<P>We put out the colours of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> and not of <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e there

<P>The next day we &s;ent two of our Officers up the River, about ten leagues, to wait upon the King of <HI>Boure,</HI> with our u&s;ual pre&s;ents, and to de&s;ire permi&s;&s;ion to trade, and to furni&s;h our &s;elves with fre&s;h water, &amp; wood; and in the mean time our people fell to work to cut down wood, and carry water, the Notary, my &s;elf, &amp; one of my &s;ervants, going along with them as a guard.

The Clerk and my &s;elf were returning in our great &s;hallop laden with bala&s;t, and advanc'd as much as the tide (which was then coming in) would give us leave, in &s;o much that our &s;hallop was afloat: which being ob&s;erved by the Cap|tain and his <HI>Mores,</HI> they put them|&s;elves into their <HI>Canoes</HI> again, and made with all &s;peed to our men, who were cutting down wood upon the banks of the Bay.

At their landing the <HI>Mores</HI> aban|doned the fountain, and betook them&s;elves to the Woods, where they made a great noi&s;e likewi&s;e, but without any attempt, for our men having run towards them, and fired 5 or 6 mu&s;quets at a venture into the woods, they took their heels, and from that time we heard no more of <HI>Moun&s;ieur Thomas,</HI> nor any of his crew.</P>
<P>After dinner our Emba&s;&s;adors returned from the King of <HI>Boure</HI>'s Court, having &s;tayed there with his mo&s;t Augu&s;t Maje&s;ty but one night: but they brought mo&s;t of the <HI>Canoes</HI> thereabout along with them, laden with Ivory, which was bought off indifferent cheap.</P>

<P>The Brother of the King of <HI>Si|erra-Leone</HI> is a per&s;on of about fifty or three&s;core years of age, and be|gins now to grow gray: his &s;tature is but indifferent, but grave, and in|telligent enough in his affairs.

<PB N="35" REF="22"> &s;trip'd with black and blew, he had a gray hat upon his head, a &s;tick like a mu&s;quet re&s;t in his hand, his Attendants had all of them Robes of Cotton cloth, only the <HI>Portugal</HI> was dre&s;t <HI>ala Portugai&s;e.</HI></P>

<PB N="36" REF="23"> of gathering their Rights, and the frequency of their Commerce with the <HI>Portugals,</HI> has brought them to talk altogether by <HI>Barres,</HI> which is the word they do mo&s;t ordinarily u&s;e.</P>
<P>According to their demand, the 20 <HI>Barres</HI> were payed him, that is to &s;ay, in Iron 12 <HI>Barres</HI> a little Barrel of Strong-waters at 4 <HI>Barrs,</HI> a Kettle at 2 <HI>Barres,</HI> a Hat at 2 <HI>Barres,</HI> and &s;o on: He was him&s;elf upon his own &s;core pre&s;ented with 2 Bottles of Brandy, and his Reti|nue with Knives: at the clo&s;e of the evening he returned, well &s;tuft and well &s;atisfied, as the greate&s;t part of his Attendants were al&s;o; at his departure he had &s;everal Guns given him, and was di&s;mi&s;t with all po&s;&s;ible civility.

<HEAD>The De&s;cription of Sierra-Leone, or the Mountain of the Lyons.</HEAD>
<P>THe Countrey of <HI>Sierra-Leone,</HI> is called <HI>Boulombel</HI> by the <HI>Mores,</HI> which in their language is as much as the large Countrey. In re&s;pect of the extraordinary height of the Mountaines towards the South, which are much higher then either the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> or <HI>Alps,</HI> and the multitude of Lyons which are con&s;tantly to be &s;een there, it was called <HI>Sierra Leone</HI> by the <HI>Por|tugals,</HI> which in our Language amounts to no more then the
<PB N="38" REF="24"> <HI>Mountain of Lyons:</HI> Their Coun|trey begins a great way up in the land Ea&s;tward, and ends North|we&s;t with the <HI>Cap-Ledo,</HI> which throws it &s;elf into the Sea: from the point of that <HI>Cape,</HI> as on pa&s;&s;es up the River, there are &s;everal Bayes, the fourth of which is the <HI>Bay de France,</HI> either becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> were formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Coa&s;t, or that they burn'd a Town there heretofore, and this is the only Bay in that River where they can take in fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>I had one day the curio&s;ity to trace one of the three Fountaines which are there, and having fol|lowed it a league to the foot of the Mountaines, ob&s;erving the tracks and Print of the wild bea&s;ts, which are very &s;trange, and dreadful, I returned as I went, and have been &s;ince informed by one of the <HI>Por|tugals,</HI> that it ri&s;es in the mid&s;t of
<PB N="39" REF="24"> the woods, which are above 15 leagues over, and that if I had pur&s;ued my de&s;ign, and traced it to its &s;pring, I mu&s;t never have ex|pected to come back, as well for the va&s;t number of Lyons, as for the Tygars, Elephants, and Cro|codiles which are there, and would probably have devoured me.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Mountains are covered with Trees very full of Gumme, always green, and for the mo&s;t part not unlike our Laurel.</P>
<P>The Northen parts of this <HI>Sierra-Leone</HI> lye very low; and are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King of <HI>Boulom,</HI> as the Southern parts are of the King of <HI>Boure.</HI></P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Boulom</HI> is not o|verwell known, either to the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Hollander,</HI> their affections being principally inclin'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> of which la&s;t, there are &s;everal that inhabit there.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="25">
<P>The River which bears the name of <HI>Sierra-Leone</HI> likewi&s;e, runs a great way Ea&s;tward up into the Countrey, is about 3 leagues over at the mouth; and one about 14 or 15 leagues higher. The Harbour is not above two fathoms deep, in|&s;omuch that in entring into it, we were fain to come as neer the Mountains as we could, where we found 10, 12, and 16 fathoms wa|ter. It has &s;everal little I&s;lands in its channel, the mo&s;t of them in|habited, and covered with green Trees, e&s;pecially Palm trees, of which they make great quantities of Wine; It is very full of Fi&s;h, and breeds Crocodiles near the head of its Fountain.</P>
<P>The borders of the&s;e I&s;lands are &s;et with certain Trees who&s;e bran|ches do never extend them&s;elves further out one then another, but the &s;hutes or &s;iences growing
<PB N="41" REF="25"> downwards, as &s;oon as they touch the water or the earth, they take new root, and by that means make a Hedge &s;ometimes of 10 or 12 yards broad.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Coun|trey are very well made, I ob&s;erv'd very few of them Camous'd, the men much more civil than at <HI>Cap-Verd,</HI> they are always clothed, and for the mo&s;t part more mode&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Town of <HI>Boure</HI> there can|not be above 300 hou&s;es, accord|ing to the e&s;timation of &s;ome of our men who were there, and told me among other things, that the Pallace of their King is built like|wi&s;e in the middle of the Town, and would not make a good re&s;i|dence for a Ju&s;tice of Peace.</P>
<P>Their Women are generally common, every man has as many of them as he plea&s;eth, and pro|&s;titutes them to Strangers, as he
<PB N="42" REF="26"> thinks good, except only the fir&s;t, which are kept with great jealou|&s;y, and circum&s;pection all along the&s;e Coa&s;ts, &s;o as properly the o|ther are nothing but Concubines.</P>
<P>According to the computation of every body I &s;pake with, there may be in <HI>Boure</HI> about 4 or 500 men, be&s;ides women and children: Their King is a Roman Catholick his name <HI>Philippes,</HI> and has a <HI>Capu|chin</HI> and a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> in his Court.</P>
<P>In an I&s;land called <HI>Saint Andrew,</HI> I entred into one of their hou&s;es, and found it built of &s;ticks and dirt, on one &s;ide a little window cove|red with leaves, a hole for the dore, and a &s;mall fire in the middle; they lye upon matts, made of great ru&s;hes, which they place in a corner, and have their Arms by their &s;ides, which for the mo&s;t part are &s;words, daggers, darts, bows and arrows, the head of which
<PB N="43" REF="26"> they impoi&s;on with fruit of a cer|tain tree, who&s;e poi&s;on is &s;o incon|ceiveably &s;ubtil and quick, it runs immediatly into the blood, and af|fects it &s;o &s;uddenly, it is no ea&s;y matter either to prevent or cure it: Which fruit is long like a rad|di&s;h, and green. Some of them have their Guns, which they all of them are fond of, and do u&s;e with great dexterity.</P>
<P>Their Religion al&s;o is various, the great Commerce the <HI>Portugals</HI> have in this place, and the great numbers that inhabit there already have converted many of them, the re&s;t being <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and <HI>Ido|lators.</HI> They pay a reverence ex|traordinary to certain extravigant figures, which they call <HI>Fetiches,</HI> wor&s;hip them as Gods, pray to them punctually Morning and Night, and when at any time they have any thing better then ordi|nary,
<PB N="44" REF="27"> either Meat, or fi&s;h, or their Palm-Wine, they throw it all down upon the ground in ho|nour to their Gods.</P>
<P>As I went a &s;hore one day in the <HI>Canoe</HI> of a certain <HI>More,</HI> I heard him muttering to him&s;elf, and having di&s;tingui&s;h'd the&s;e words <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> I asked him what he was doing, he told me he was giving thanks to his <HI>Fetiche,</HI> for having pre&s;erved him at Sea, and that the re&s;t of the <HI>Mores,</HI> as they had occa&s;ion, did always the &s;ame: They all of them carry their <HI>Fetiches</HI> in little baggs, either upon their hearts, or their &s;houlders, tendring them meat Night and Morning con&s;tantly, they trim them up with <HI>Ra&s;ade;</HI> or little grains of gla&s;s of all colours, which they take to be the greate&s;t Ornament in the world.</P>
<P>This Country produces great

<P>They appeared very joyful at our arrival; they told us their King lived three days journey up into the Countrey, that they would give notice to their neighbours of our coming that night, and that if we thought good to return the next morning, we might find &s;uch &s;tore of Ivory as could be &s;uddenly got.

<P>Whil&s;t we were Negotiating our affairs, we heard a great noi&s;e on a &s;udden, and &s;aw the <HI>Mores</HI> in a great hurry, running Pell-mell from their hou&s;es, and merchandi&s;e both: we apprehended we might be &s;urprized, and took up our arms immediately, but being got out in|to the air, we under&s;tood it was

<P>Before him marched his Drum, and his Trumpet, 8 or 10 of his kin|dred and friends, and the re&s;t were his Officers: his Wives, and his Daughters, marched on his &s;ide, be|hind him his Slaves followed, and a certain number of women carrying his dinner in bowls of Wood, and of Tyn, which they held up as high as they could po&s;&s;ibly: By him he had four Slaves marching, two of them covering him with two large Bucklers, and the other carrying his bow and arrows, and javelin: As he approached, the <HI>Mores</HI> di|vided them&s;elves, the Men on one &s;ide, the Women on the other, &s;inging, and dancing, and leap|ing up and down, and te&s;tifying
<PB N="58" REF="34"> their joy in a thou&s;and different po&s;|tures.

Pre|&s;ently the King took an arrow, which he &s;hot up into the aire, and pre&s;ently all run to the place where it fell, and happy was he that could take it up fir&s;t, and bring it to him; after this he made a &s;how of &s;hooting directly among&s;t them, &amp; they throwing them&s;elves down again, with great acclamation, con|tinued this pa&s;time for a quarter of an hour: In this triumpth and gran|dour, he was conducted to us; we received him as honorably as we could, &s;aluting him with volleys of &s;mall &s;hot.</P>
<P>He was a grave and venerable
<PB N="59" REF="34"> old man of about three&s;core years of age, or upwards, they called him <HI>Falam Boure,</HI> he was very &s;en&s;ible and maje&s;tick: his habit was the &s;ame with the re&s;t of the Gentle|men, &s;aving that his was quite blew, and the Robes of the Gentle|men, Officers, and Nobility of that Countrey, are always &s;trip'd (like the Captains of <HI>Rio-Fre&s;ca</HI>) with white and blew: We payed him what re&s;pect vve could, and after vve had made him &s;uch pre&s;ents as vvere u&s;ual, he retired into another Arbor the <HI>Mores</HI> had made for him, and left us very graciou&s;ly to our Negotiations.</P>

<P>For their Religion, do what I could, I could not inform my &s;elf, only one of them told me the Whites pray'd to God, and the Blacks to the Devil: Yet I could perceive many of them were Cir|cumci&s;ed, and all of them had their <HI>Fetiches.</HI></P>

<P>In the Kings hou&s;es, or the hou|&s;es of their Nobility, they have a di&s;tinct appartment where their beds are made, either upon plancks, or mat; about a yeard from the ground, about which they hang a cloth (in &s;tead of curtains and val|lence) and &s;o &s;leep all night upon them.

<P>For four days together we had a very good Trade. The commodi|ties we bought were Mats, Rice, and Ivory, which in tho&s;e parts is plentiful and excellently good.</P>
<P>And in this place certainly (if any where) a man may live hap|pily, all things contributing to make his life plea&s;ant; the beauty and bounty of the Countrey, the humour and di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple, the aboundance of all nece&s;&s;a|ries, the con&s;iderablene&s;s of the gain, and the aptne&s;s and conve|nience for building in all places wherever you come.</P>

<P>The fifteenth we di&s;covered our mi&s;take, yet by rea&s;on of calme, we were forc'd to continue at anchor till noon, at which time we percei|ved a <HI>Canoe</HI> making towards us with 2 <HI>Mores</HI> in it, which coming up, de|manded

<P>This <HI>Cape</HI> is called <HI>Mi&s;erado</HI> by the <HI>Portugais,</HI> either becau&s;e it is in|compa&s;s'd by rocks that lye under

<HEAD>RIO-SEXTOS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>RIo-Sextos</HI> is a River, which comes a great way down the land, North and North-We&s;t, and is about half a league over at the mouth of it. On both &s;ides it is &s;et very plea&s;antly with Trees, very large, and very tall; about three leagues up the River, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had formerly a hou&s;e, but there is nothing of it left but the Walls.
<PB N="78" REF="44"> This River will carry a Yacht or a large Barke a douzaine leagues and more up in the Countrey.</P>
<P>It was called <HI>Rio-Sextos</HI> by the <HI>Portugais,</HI> from a certain kind of Pepper which grows by it, and is called <HI>Sextos</HI> by them, the &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e with what we call <HI>Mala|guette</HI> which I &s;hall &s;peake of more particularly in the next Chapter: We were told by their fi&s;herboats, that about a fortnight before there pa&s;s'd two <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els that way to the <HI>Mine,</HI> that we might finde good quantities of Ivory, but that their <HI>Canoes</HI> being &s;o &s;mall, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for us to carry our Mer|chanhi&s;e on &s;hore: whereupon we anchor'd about half a league from land, in about 16 fathom water.</P>
<P>Some of our Officers went a &s;hore in our &s;hallop, and carryed &s;ome Commodities along with them, to begin the Commerce; they carryed
<PB N="79" REF="44"> them three leagues up the River, and their King (who lived yet high|er into the Countrey) came down to &s;ee them, and according to Cu&s;|tome had his u&s;ual pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>They came back very late, and the Notary at his return gave me this accompt of him, that he was a very lu&s;ty man, with a &s;tern and &s;u|percilious a&s;pect; that he profe&s;s'd great frien&s;hip for the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> That he brought down great &s;tore of Ivo|ry with him, but having furni&s;hed the two <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els &s;o lately, he held it &s;o dear, there was no dealing with him for it. That they &s;eem'd wor&s;e natured then the <HI>Mores</HI> at <HI>Mi&s;erado;</HI> But that the River was very fine, and is full of little &s;tones upon the &s;hore like our Flints, only the&s;e are harder, and give more fire upon any colli&s;ion.</P>
<P>While&s;t they were among&s;t them, there came about 10 or 12 of their
<PB N="80" REF="45"> <HI>Canoes</HI> aboard us with a kind of Sea-Pike (an excellent good fi&s;h) and &s;everal other &s;orts, of which we bought &s;ome.</P>
<P>The people are generally well proportioned, and bearing eve|ry one of them the name of &s;ome Saint or other, I had a great curio|&s;ity to know how that cu&s;tom came upon them. I took one of them a&s;ide, and having cajoled him with a gla&s;s of Wine, and &s;trong-water (which they love better then their Wives) I asked him the rea&s;on, and he told me, that when any Ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ed that way, and did the Natives any kindne&s;s, it was u&s;ual to begg their Names at their departure, which they gave afterwards to their chil|dren, in memory of the courte&s;ie they had received from them: Which convinced me, being im|belli&s;hed with &s;o noble a virtue as gratitude, they could not be &s;o bad
<PB N="81" REF="45"> as they had been repre&s;ented to me, and the rather, becau&s;e the King of them having upon the death of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant &s;eized upon all his Ivory and goods, did upon the arrival of the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, vo|luntarily, and without any &s;olicita|tion, deliver all to the Captain: An invincible argument of their piety and &s;aith. I gave him that gave me this accompt, two little knives for his pains, and he was &s;o &s;urpris'd at the pre&s;ent, he de&s;ired my name, and I having told him, he oblig'd him|&s;elf, if his Wife (which was big at that time) was brought to bed of a boy, he &s;hould carry my name, and if ever I return'd that way, he would bring him to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>All along this Coa&s;t, their man|ner of &s;alutation is the &s;ame, they take our &s;ore finger and thumb, into their hands, and putting them into a certain po&s;ture, they pull them
<PB N="82" REF="46"> hard, and make them &s;nap, crying out <HI>Aquio</HI> when they have done, which is as much as <HI>your Servant</HI> with us.</P>
<P>This Countrey is very fertil, well furni&s;h'd with Fowl, and Rice, and Millet, of which they make all the bread, which they carry with them in their <HI>Canoes</HI> when they go out a fi&s;hing, which (as I ob&s;er|ved) they are very neat and axact in keeping clean.</P>
<P>He that would &s;tay upon the place, might make very good advan|tage either by Rice, or Pepper, or Ivory, which is excellently good; their kindne&s;s has been always more con&s;picious to the <HI>French,</HI> then either to the <HI>Hollander</HI> or <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> neither of which they would ever &s;uffer to cohabit with them.</P>
<P>On the 32th. by break of day, we di&s;covered a little Fleet of <HI>Canoes</HI> of about 40, which were go|ing
<PB N="83" REF="46"> a fi&s;hing, and within a quarter of an hour they di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves every way: Of the whole <HI>Ar|mada,</HI> there was but one came to us, with &s;ome few Elephants teeth, which he held &s;o dear he had his labour for his paines, and carryed them off as he brought them; where|upon we al&s;o weighed anchor for <HI>Rio-Sanguin,</HI> which is the fir&s;t place upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malaguette,</HI> and about twelve leagues from <HI>Rio-Sextos;</HI> for four hours together we &s;teer'd Southward to avoid the Rocks which ly in great numbers betwixt <HI>Rio-Sanguin,</HI> and <HI>Rio-Sextos,</HI> after which we &s;teer'd Ea&s;t and by North, and came &s;afe to <HI>Rio-Sanguin.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> had the preoc|cupancy of the&s;e Coa&s;ts, in re&s;pect of all other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> I think is clear from the Names of &s;e|veral Bayes, and a hundred other monuments of their glory: But at

<P>Their authority over the <HI>Mores</HI> upon the Coa&s;ts is &s;o great, they manage them as thy think good, and we can never read that they have at any time rebelled&punc; again&s;t them, as they have frequently done again&s;t the re&s;t of the <HI>Euro|peans;</HI> Nay&punc; &s;o ab&s;olute is their Empire, they are many times &s;erved at the table by the Sons of that King, which is &s;o &s;uperlative a command, there can be nothing beyond it; Yet if any other <HI>Euro|pean</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="48"> does but quarrel or affront any of their Grandees, there is nothing but they will attempt which may contribute to their revenge. One of them who came to traffick with us at <HI>Sierra-Leone,</HI> told me, he did u&s;e every year to go to <HI>Senegal,</HI> which is two hundred leagues from <HI>Sierra-Leone,</HI> and that where he had not the conveniency of a river, both him&s;elf and his Commodities were carryed up into the Coun|trey on the backs of the <HI>Mores.</HI></P>
<P>They have all of them little Chappels built near their hou&s;es, in which they u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means for the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e people, and when they have had any &s;ucce&s;s, and made a pro&s;ilite, they hang Chappelets about his neck, and have a particular care of them ever after.</P>

<P>The <HI>Grand Drouin</HI> is &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of a little River, which winds about a little I&s;land betwixt 2 Mountains; it is encompa&s;s'd with excellent Meadows, and is wa&s;h'd &s;o gently by the water, you would think it was affraid to come near it.</P>
<P><HI>Rio</HI> S. <HI>Andre</HI> of all <HI>Africk</HI> ts the propere&s;t place for building, the River of the &s;ame name, runs up far into the Countrey, and not far from the place where it falls into the Sea, it divides its &s;elf into two branches, one running North-We&s;t, and the other Ea&s;t: It is bordered on both &s;ides with very fair Trees, environed with fine Meadows and Fields, and is deep enough to car|ry a Yacht an indifferent way up. The Rock at the Sea &s;ide, at the
<PB N="106" REF="58"> mouth of the River, is three hun|dred paces in circumference the top, which being flat, commands all the Countrey about it without any conte&s;t. 'Tis very &s;teep to|wards the Sea, and on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and indeed inacce&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s by the River on the We&s;t, which makes it &s;o near being an I&s;land, that the cutting but of 15 paces of earth, would make it one entirely; On all other &s;ides it is encompa&s;s'd with Rocks under water, upon w^c^h even a &s;hallop would be lo&s;t: The fre&s;h water which comes out of a Fountain at the foot of a large Mountain, which covers this Rock on the North-&s;ide, may be defen|ded from thence with the &s;hot of a <HI>Faucon;</HI> and the Towns of <HI>Petit-Drouin, Tao,</HI> and <HI>Groua,</HI> are at no greater di&s;tance then the <HI>Grand-Drouin,</HI> which is only one league and no more: From the top of this

<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 9th of <HI>February</HI> we came to an anchor, and took in fre&s;h water all the re&s;t of the day, as well as on the <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Mun|day</HI> following, which gave me op|portunity of con&s;idering the&s;e fol|lowing ob&s;ervations: The water we took in at this place &s;erved us almo&s;t till we came at the I&s;le of <HI>S.

<P>Upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts they have great quantities of Bullocks, Goats, Kids, Hoggs, and Dear, which are &s;o cheep, one may buy a good Beef of them for a douzain of knives of about twenty pence, and a good Roe Buck for the &s;ame price.</P>
<P>The People are well made, &s;trong, lu&s;ty, their limbs large and fat, but their looks au&s;tere and dreadfull, and 'tis reported they do eat the Whites: I never heard of any hou&s;e built by the <HI>Europeans</HI> in the&s;e parts where they land but very rarely, and have as little to do with them as they can.</P>
<P>'Tis not above thirteen or four|teen years ago, &s;ince fourteen <HI>Hol|landers</HI> were killed, and eaten at <HI>Rio S. Andre,</HI> as they were taking in fre&s;h water, without any occa&s;ion of quarrel; for which rea&s;on, we went alwayes well armed, and were alwayes upon our guard.</P>
<PB N="109" REF="59">
<P>The common people wear only a linnen cloth before but the Gran|dees and Nobles of the Countrey are con&s;picuous by a kind of Man|tle they wrap about them, and a Ponyard by their &s;ides.

<P>The women of <HI>Giron,</HI> and <HI>Petit-Drouin,</HI> had the curio&s;ity to come and look upon us as we were take|ing in water, and to bring their daughters along with them, the liniaments and features of their fa|ces were &s;o ju&s;t and regular, that (bate them the unhappine&s;s of their complexion) they were ab&s;o|lute beauties: Among&s;t fifty of them which I &s;aw, there was not any fat or tall, wheras on the contrary, not one of a hundred among&s;t the men

When they come aboard any Ship, the Captain of it mu&s;t come to them, and it is their cu&s;tom whil&s;t they have one foot upon their <HI>Canoe,</HI> and the other upon the Ship, holding by one hand upon the Rope, they dip the other in the Sea, and throw their handfull upon his head, which is intended as a great in&s;tance of kindne&s;s and ami|ty, and in this they are &s;o perti|natiou&s;ly &s;uper&s;titious, that without it they will never be forc'd nor per&s;waded to enter any Ship: and when they would affirm any thing with more vehemence than ordi|nary, they u&s;e the &s;ame ceremony:
<PB N="111" REF="60"> They are &s;o diffident and di&s;tru&s;t|full, they will never begot with all the art can be u&s;ed, either under deck, or into any of the Cabains, which the <HI>Mores</HI> of all other parts, would do very freely.</P>
<P>They have a great fancy for brace|lets of Iron, with rings and bells up|on them, with which kind of Gal|lantry, mo&s;t of their arms, and legs, are plentifully furni&s;h'd; they have great &s;tore of <HI>Mulettoes</HI> among them.</P>
<P>We could not under&s;tand their language, nor they &s;peak one word of <HI>Portugais:</HI> When they came fir&s;t aboard us, they cryed <HI>Qua, Qua, Qua,</HI> which we found after|wards to be as much as, <HI>you are welcome,</HI> or <HI>good morrow;</HI> for which rea&s;on the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have given the name of <HI>Quaqua</HI> to a good part of this Coa&s;t: they made great u&s;e of that word, e&s;pecially if their Gutts had been filled.</P>

<P>The Commodities which this Countrey yeilds, are Elephants teeth, &s;o large &s;ometimes, that they weigh 200 weight a piece, and then they are worth 10000 livers: If we may credit tho&s;e that live on the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t,</HI> which are their Neigh|bours, they have &s;o great number of Elephants, that they are forc'd for their &s;ecurity again&s;t them, to make their hou&s;es under ground: They kill as many of them as they can: but that which accommo|dates them with &s;o many teeth, is, that the Elephants doe &s;hed them every three year, as the Staggs doe their Horns.</P>
<P>This Countrey affords likewi&s;e good &s;tore of Cotton, of which they make a pritty &s;ort of &s;tuff, &s;trip'd with white, and blew, about three quarters broad, and three or four ells long, which is much valued a|mong&s;t them, and &s;old afterwards
<PB N="113" REF="61" MS="y"> at a good rate upon the <HI>Gold Coast,</HI> to cover their Pe&s;antry there.</P>
<P>They have Gold among&s;t them likewi&s;e undoubtedly, for without any Commerce or communication with their Neighbours, they bind up their hair for the mo&s;t part with hair laces of Gold very curiou&s;ly made; I made a &s;ign to one of them, to know which way they came by it, and he &s;how'd me the great Mountaines up the Countrey afar off, and &s;ign'd to me from thence. for which rea&s;on, he that &s;hould make further di&s;covery of the&s;e parts, would que&s;tionle&s;s encoun|ter many rarities, and without a|ny great difficulties, in regard the Countrey con&s;i&s;ts for the mo&s;t part of Plaines.

<PB N="115" REF="62">
<P>The 4th of <HI>March</HI> we pa&s;t before <HI>Albiani, Tabo,</HI> and other Towns, upon that Coa&s;t: The Countrey there is but low likewi&s;e, very full of Trees, but no River at all: Tho&s;e <HI>Canoes</HI> which came aboard us ha|ving a&s;&s;ured us, they had no Gold, we gave them the go by, and pa&s;t on.</P>
<P>We thought to have doubled the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Apollonia</HI> that night, but two of their <HI>Canoes</HI> coming up to us, and promi&s;ing fair, we beleived them and ca&s;t anchor.</P>
<P>The next day &s;ome of their <HI>Canoes</HI> brought &s;ome Gold, which we bought of them, though it was not much: This <HI>Cape</HI> throws it &s;elf a far into the Sea, and rai&s;ing it &s;elf by degrees into Hills, and then into a Mountain, makes no unplea&s;ant pro&s;pect. But it is of no good acce&s;s, the Sea beating &s;o violently upon it, there is great danger in approching: We weigh'd
<PB N="116" REF="63"> anchor again that night, but the weather being calme, we could not reach <HI>Axime</HI> before <HI>Sunday</HI> in the afternoon, at which time we came to an anchor.</P>
<P><HI>Axime</HI> is a Fort belonging to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> &s;ome twelve leagues di|&s;tant from the <HI>Cape Apollonia,</HI> &s;ituate upon the &s;ide of a River, which runs up Northward al&s;o into the Countrey, and abounds with Gold-Sand, which is e&s;teem'd the be&s;t of all that Coa&s;t.

<P>We weigh'd anchor at that time, and came to anchor again betwixt <HI>Saconde</HI> and <HI>Takorai,</HI> about &s;ix leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Botrou,</HI> they are &s;eated among&s;t the Mountains, which lean as it were upon the banks of the River they lye &s;o near it; at which place, we received Letters from the Governour of <HI>Frederisbourg,</HI> not far from <HI>Cape Cor&s;e,</HI> offring us his road (if we plea&s;ed) in con&s;ideration of the alliance betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Den|mark,</HI> de&s;iring us al&s;o to &s;ecure &s;ome of his Merchandi&s;e for him.</P>

<P>The <HI>Mores</HI> which came aboard us, were in great anxiety and di&s;|order to re&s;olve which way they &s;hould &s;ignifie their joy.

<P>THe Inhabitants of the Golden Coa&s;t are hand&s;ome, and well-proportioned, they have no|thing di&s;agreeable in their Coun|tenance, but the blackne&s;s of their Complexion; &s;ome of them have flatti&s;h no&s;es, and all of them little ears; their eyes are quick and &s;park|ling, but above all, their teeth as white as Ivory, of which they have a particular care, and for their con|&s;ervation, are perpetually champ|ing a certain wood which grows in the kingdome of <HI>Acanis,</HI> which has a peculiar quality of making them white, of pre&s;erving their gums, and preventing any black|ne&s;s or rottenne&s;s in them. Though
<PB N="134" REF="72"> their beards appear not &s;o &s;oon as ours, yet they affect them exceed|ingly, and their Grandees and Officers wear them very long upon their chins, and &s;ome of them like the <HI>Capuchins</HI> with us. Their skin is black indeed, but &s;mooth and delicate, without any hair, but as they grow old, their blackne&s;s le&s;&s;ens, and their hair which is &s;hort, black, and frizell'd, grows grizled by degrees.</P>
<P>Their Stomachs are generally &s;o hot, they do not only dige&s;t all kind of meats that are roa&s;ted or boyled, but raw likewi&s;e; and &s;ome there are among them which prefer that to the other.</P>
<P>They are great lovers of cleanli|ne&s;s, and wa&s;h them&s;elves dayly to prevent Vermin, rubbing after|ward with oyl of Palmes. They are not at all a&s;hamed of their nu|dity, but they have &s;o great an ab|horrency
<PB N="135" REF="72"> and dete&s;tation of belch|ing, or any &s;uch thing, that they will &s;ooner die than do it; and if it happens at any time they be in the company of any <HI>Europeans</HI> that are guilty of it, they run out of the room immediately, making the horrible&s;t faces imaginable.</P>
<P>They have a great deal of wit, are &s;olid in their judgements, cun|ning, and &s;o dexterous and quick, one need never &s;hew them the &s;ame thing twice: they are lyers to the highe&s;t degree, their memory tran&s;cendent, and though they can neither write nor read, yet they manage their Trade with the great|e&s;t exactne&s;s: they never di&s;pute the commands which are laid upon them: you &s;hall have a Merchant negotiating and managing 4 Marks of gold for 20 &s;everal per&s;ons, every particular man de&s;iring five or &s;ix &s;everal Commodities, which he
<PB N="136" REF="73"> performs without ha&s;itation or mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Their addre&s;s appears abun|dantly by their dexterity in their Commerce, they are all of them given to pilfering, covetous to that point, e&s;pecially to the Whites, that they think they do a mighty act, if they pre&s;ent them with a little fruit: they are drunken, luxurious, and much &s;ubject to the <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> which is no &s;candal among&s;t them: they are but ill payma&s;ters, and &s;atisfie their debts with great difficulty and unwillingne&s;s: they are great enemies to cold weather, and endure it with much impatience: &s;o proud, that their Merchants, (who are all of them Nobles, Cap|tains, or other great Officers) march up and down the Streets with their eyes fix'd upon the ground, not vouch&s;afing &s;o much
<PB N="137" REF="73"> as a glance upon the common peo|ple: behind them they have con|&s;tantly a Slave with a chair in his hand, that they may &s;it down when they plea&s;e, it being thought di&s;honourable to be too long upon their leggs; they never an&s;wer any ordinary per&s;on, but with great &s;u|perciliou&s;ne&s;s, and never &s;peak to them but with great Maje&s;ty: to o|ther people they are civil enough, and pay very much re&s;pect to the Whites, e&s;pecially if they be Of|ficers, to whom they never &s;peak but with their hat in their hand. The &s;ure&s;t way of gaining their af|fection, is to be civil to them which they value more than any other thing one can do.</P>
<P>Though the manner of their habits be much different from ours yet they are as curious and as proud in them, as the be&s;t of us. When their Officers or Mer+chants
<PB N="138" REF="74"> walking the Streets, or are in tran&s;action with any Stranger, they take a piece of Silk, Taffaty, or fine Indian Damask, about two or three Ells long, which they tye a|bout their wa&s;te, and afterwards bringing it betwixt their thighs, they let the two ends hang down before and behind almo&s;t to the ground. Sometimes they wrap o|ther Stuffs about them, from their brea&s;t to their mid-legg, or el&s;e throw it over their &s;houlders like a Mantle.</P>
<P>They order their hair in &s;everal ways; but rich, and poor, and all, are very curious in adju&s;ting it hand|&s;omely, and inventing new modes and gallantries to adorn it, it being the only bu&s;ine&s;s almo&s;t which gives their women imployment. Mo&s;t of them dave hats, &s;ome of Straw, &s;ome of the Bark of trees, &s;ome of Goats-skin, but their Slaves
<PB N="139" REF="74"> are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by going bare-headed: they trim them&s;elves up with divers Necklaces of <HI>Ra&s;ade,</HI> and Bracelets, which they beautifie with little works of Gold, in ho|nour to their God, after they have muttered out &s;ome of their Prayers over it: they have Rings or Jewels upon the &s;mall of their Leggs, or el&s;e a &s;tring of Coraile, of the bark of the Tree, under which they pay wor&s;hip to their <HI>Fetiches.</HI></P>
<P>Though they love exceedingly to be &s;pruce yet, they are good hou&s;e-wives of their cloths, never put on their finery but upon &s;ome &s;uch extraordinary occa&s;ion as I have mentioned, and then whip and off with them again as &s;oon as they come home, folding them up care|fully, and putting them into che&s;ts, which they buy of the <HI>Europeans</HI> for that purpo&s;e, where they lye &s;nugg till &s;ome new opportunity
<PB N="140" REF="75"> brings them abroad again: Never|thele&s;s from the King to the Cob|ler they affect change of apparel, to make them&s;elves more con&s;ide|rable, and that more or le&s;s accord|ing to their riches or gains. And yet for all this in the main they are frugal enough, will buy nothing that is &s;uperfluous, but what they do buy, let it be &s;tuff, or any thing el&s;e, they will be &s;ure it be la&s;ting and good, or they will be &s;ure to have none of it, for all &s;light things they laugh at and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>

<P>They have witt enough, good <HI>mine,</HI> hone&s;t, and obliging, but much more curteous then the men; they are very grave, addicted to frugality in their hou&s;es, but to pompe and o&s;tention abroad: But their la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s is above all, which they &s;uck as it were with their milk, playing hoyty|toyty among&s;t the young fellows &s;tarke naked. There are but few of them barren before, but when married they are &s;eldome over fertile, which may be attributed to their temper and complection, for there is &s;eldome any of them have above four or five.</P>
<P>The Virgins, (to plea&s;e, and to enamour the young men, as &s;oon as they are up every morning) take water and wa&s;h, and then combe their haire (which they
<PB N="142" REF="76"> have in twice the plenty the men have) with great curio&s;ity, pla|ting and di&s;po&s;ing it in a hundred &s;everal modes and gallantries, gum|ming it with oyl of Palmes, in&s;tead of mouth glew, tying it with ri|bands if they have any, if not, adorning it with little pieces of gold, or a certain red cockle &s;hell, which is very common among&s;t them. Some of them paint their foreheads with red and white, and &s;ometimes their eye-brows, and cheeks: they cut and carve their skins about their ears, and temples, which ri&s;ing up in little bli&s;ters, they paint them over with divers colours, and fancy it a great addi|tion to their beauty: they have all of them Pendants at their ears, they all of them love the Ribbands, and above all Ribbands, the red; they wear necklaces of Corail, or of <HI>Ra&s;ade,</HI> and bracelets not only
<PB N="143" REF="76"> upon their wri&s;ts and their armes, but upon their leggs, and their ankles; the maidens for the mo&s;t part have their bracelets made of the bark of that tree which is dedi|cated to their <HI>Fetiches,</HI> which are their Gods as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter. When they go abroad, if they be the Wives of Merchants, Officers, or Captains, in that Countrey, they have a piece of Silk, Taffaty, or other Stuff, either red, or blew, or violet-colour'd (which are the co|lours they are mo&s;t plea&s;ed with) which they take and wrap about them, from the brea&s;t to the mid-legg, &s;tuffing it out behind with a great Rouler. They have alwayes a great bunch of keys at their gir|dle, though they have many times never a Che&s;t in the world: they wear bracelets of Ivory, and Gold, and Rings in that abundance, one can &s;ee no fingers that they have
<PB N="144" REF="77"> &s;ometimes; and in this po&s;ture they are fit to be &s;een: the common &s;ort dre&s;s them &s;elves as fine as they can too, but when they come in again, they are mighty careful to &s;old them up hand&s;omely, putting on a kind of coar&s;e linnen with which they make &s;hift to cover them&s;elves from the Navel, to the mid&s;t of their Thigh. They love variety of habits too as well as the men, but the Virgins e&s;pecially, who make it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s from morning to night to &s;pruce up them&s;elves, and make them&s;elves acceptable, above all to the Whites, whom they &s;eem to care&s;s much more than tho&s;e of their own Complexion.</P>

<P>I Happen'd to be pre&s;ent at a Marriage whil&s;t I was at <HI>Fre|derisbourg,</HI> which was con&s;umma|ted in no unplea&s;ant manner.

<PB N="148" REF="79"> very lovingly together, and have &s;eldome any jealou&s;ies or animo&s;ity among&s;t them. A good Merchant, or Officer, will have twenty or thirty, according to his abilities. The King of <HI>Fetu</HI>'s Son-in-Law had forty, by whom he had a dou|zain of daughters, fourteen to the douzain of the other Sex, and kept con&s;tantly a hundred Slaves to at|tend them.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e parts, who will may come into the Chamber of any Woman when &s;he lyes in: as &s;oon as the Child is &s;afe in the world, they bring the good Woman a bottle of drink made of Rice, and Mays, and Water and Wine, and <HI>Malaguette,</HI> (not unlike our Pep|per Po&s;&s;et) which having taken off kindly, they cover her well, and then leave her three or four hours to her devotions, which being over, &s;he ri&s;es immediately, wa&s;hes her
<PB N="149" REF="79"> Child, falls to her bu&s;ine&s;s, and there's an end of that labour; but (to be &s;ober) I could not but ad|mire very much the force of their temper, when I &s;aw the very &s;ame thing done by a Slaves Wife at <HI>Frederisbourg.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as they have wa&s;h'd their Child, the Father and Mother give it commonly a name, and for the mo&s;t part, of &s;ome <HI>European</HI> or other they have been beholding to, that done, they wrap it in a kind of blanket, and then lay it in a skin upon the Ru&s;hes, where it lyes quietly till it be three weeks or a month old, after which time the Mother carries it at her back upon a piece of wood with the leggs un|der her armpits, tying its two hands about her neck, where it hangs all day, and never comes off, but when &s;he goes to bed; and this is the rea&s;on why the Children of
<PB N="150" REF="80"> their Nobles, or better &s;ort, have &s;eldome camous no&s;es, becau&s;e their Wives do not labour, nor carry their Infants about them, as the others do, who&s;e Children &s;leeping many times whil&s;t the Mother is walking or at work, knock their no&s;es again&s;t their Shoulders, and &s;o in time they become flat: if they cry out for the teat, they throw their brea&s;ts over their &s;houlders, and let them &s;uck. Every morning they wa&s;h and rub them with Oyl of Palmes.</P>
<P>By that time they be 7 or 8 months old, they lay them along upon the ground, drawing them forward upon all four, like Kitlings, which po&s;&s;ibly may be the rea&s;on the Children go much &s;ooner in the&s;e Countreys than in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t they be thus tender and young, the Parents put little works of gold about their necks, wrapt up
<PB N="151" REF="80"> in the rind of the tree where they wor&s;hip their <HI>Fetiches,</HI> for fear the Devil &s;hould run away with them, and when they come to be about 4 year old, they bind little branches of it (which they buy of their Prie&s;ts) about their arms, and their leggs, wreathing and bending them into a round figure, which they look upon as a great Antidote a|gain&s;t any &s;ickne&s;s or di&s;a&s;ter what|&s;oever. In this manner they conti|nue their care of them till they be 7 or 8 years old, but after that they feed upon the &s;ame as the Father and Mother does, heaping up ma|ny time &s;uch na&s;ty things as they find in the Streets, which they eat afterward very heartily, when they are hungry: the boys and the gyrls, being higledy-pigledy to|gether, and all naked, it takes off much of their mode&s;ty, and is a cau&s;e they are never a&s;hamed of
<PB N="152" REF="81"> any thing; to which may be added their want of correction, their Pa|rents being &s;o far from whipping them, they never &s;o much as re|buke them in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>From the &s;eventh or eighth year of their age they learn to &s;wim, which they do with &s;o much &s;uc|ce&s;s and perfection, that when they are grown up, if their <HI>Canoe</HI> over|&s;ets at any time at Sea, they are not affrighted, but &s;wim back again ve|ry quietly from whence they came, they will dive excellently well too, and fetch up goods or any other thing that is accidentally ca&s;t a|way, upon which &s;core one may &s;ee the &s;hore &s;o full &s;ometimes of little Blacks, one would think them &s;o many young Devils.</P>
<P>At 12 year old they fall under the juri&s;diction of the Father, who &s;hews them which way to get their livelyhood: if he be a fi&s;herman he
<PB N="153" REF="81"> carries them to Sea, &s;hews them how to make a <HI>Canoe,</HI> and which way to take fi&s;h; if a Merchant he teaches them the mi&s;tery of Tra|ding, brings them acquainted with Forreigners, and in&s;tructs them in this manner till they be 18 or 20, and can begin to do &s;omething for them&s;elves, then he gives them Slaves to do their work, and all the care that is behind, is to help them to Wives, which from that time forward they are alwayes con|triving.</P>
<P>The Gyrls are imployed in keep|ing clean the hou&s;es, in picking their Rice, beating their <HI>Mays,</HI> ma|king their bread, managing their Kitchin, and buying or &s;elling at the Markets what is to be bought or &s;old, &s;ometimes they make bas|kets of ru&s;hes, &s;ometimes matts (in which they are tran&s;cendantly ex|cellent) &s;ometimes weave, but above
<PB N="154" REF="82"> all their care is greate&s;t of their Fa|ther and Mother, to &s;ee that they have their meat and drink in good hours, and that nothing of their goods be imbezled; in &s;hort there is nothing of good hou&s;ewivry or frugality, that is wanting among&s;t them, and when they are once marryed, they may teach that le&s;&s;on to mo&s;t of the Women of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of their Hou&s;es, Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, Drinke, Meat, Palme-Wine, and how it is made.</HEAD>
<P>THe great Commerce they have had with the <HI>Europeans</HI> having learned them the art of building, the Officers and great Merchants of this Countrey have follow'd their directions and built them&s;elves hou&s;es, with high and lofty roofes, &s;everal appartments,
<PB N="155" REF="82"> with one chamber opening into a|nother, and u&s;ually at the door of their chamber 2 Slaves con&s;tantly attending with darts in their hands in the nature of guards, which are releived at certain hours.</P>
<P>All their hou&s;es are made of earth, but the common people have their walls &s;o low, they &s;eldome exceed the height of a man. Their beame and rafters, and the whole frame of the hou&s;e re&s;ting only upon them: the hou&s;es of the Grandees as well as the commons are all thatch'd, and have all of them but one little &s;quare hole, which &s;erves for a door, to which they fa&s;ten a piece of board, without either lock or hinges, like the poor Pea&s;ants in the Countrey to their Garden-doors, and are contented to fa&s;ten them only with a rope, either with|out or within. Their windows are &s;mall, the earth they make their
<PB N="156" REF="83"> floors with, very clo&s;e and com|pact, they have at lea&s;t two cham|bers to a hou&s;e, and this character mu&s;t be given them, that they are very curious in keeping them neat, and paint them very frequently both without and within.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the common &s;ort, there is nothing of hou&s;hould-&s;tuff, or what is us'd commonly about the hou&s;e, to be &s;een, all is locked up in their Coffers, which they buy of the Whites; except they be Mer|chants or great men, and then their Tables and Chairs appear &s;ometimes, but never no Beds, for they lye alwayes upon Skins &s;pread upon the ground, or el&s;e upon Mat|tre&s;&s;es made of Ru&s;hes, covering them&s;elves with the Skins of Oxen, or &s;ome other Bea&s;t, without any Boul&s;ter, except they be of the No|bles, and then they have Pillows under their heads, and a good fire
<PB N="157" REF="83"> in the middle of their Room, but not the lea&s;t hole for a Chimney.</P>
<P>Every woman has her appart|ment, or little hou&s;e, joyning to her Husbands, con&s;i&s;ting of one or two Chambers, where &s;he mana|ges her own affairs by her &s;elf, &s;el|dome eating or drinking together. Some of them go a Go&s;&s;ipping to their Neighbours, and carry &s;uch as they have along with them. The good man takes the &s;ame cour&s;e, and he vi&s;its his Merchant, not &s;o much as concerning him&s;elf how &s;quares go at home, the women be|ing alwayes very punctual to ac|commodate them with every thing nece&s;&s;ary, and to bring up their Children carefully; yet &s;ometimes on their Fe&s;tivals, or upon &s;ome great occa&s;ion, their Stomachs come down, and they feed very lovingly together.</P>
<P>As the women have the charge
<PB N="158" REF="84"> of the hou&s;e and the money, &s;o they make it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s that neither of them mi&s;carry in their hands. The men employ them&s;elves con&s;tantly abroad, ei|ther in matters of Trade, or in ma|king of Palm-wine, or fi&s;hing, as every mans genius inclines him: when they have got any money, they give it &s;till to their wives, who order it &s;o well, they never make the lea&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary disbur&s;ement; they go every night them&s;elves in|to the granaries, delivering out &s;uch a proportion of corn as they judge will be nece&s;&s;ary for the whole fa|mily the next day.</P>
<P>By break of day the young girles are up and at work, beating their <HI>Rice,</HI> and their <HI>Mays</HI> (which is cal|led <HI>Turky</HI> wheat among&s;t us) in a wooden Mortar, and when it is bruis'd, they grind it (as the Paint|ers do their colours.) betwixt two
<PB N="159" REF="84"> &s;tones, and &s;o reduce it to powder, then kneading it with water and &s;alt, they divide it into a kind of penny loaves, and put it into a great earthen pot that &s;tands upon the fire, with a little earthen lid, they throw embers upon it, &amp; 'tis done; if it be well bak'd, 'tis very good, and without any ill reli&s;h at all.</P>
<P>Their food generally is fi&s;h, though they have great &s;tore of fle&s;h al&s;o, which they boyl or roa&s;t as they think good, but their fi&s;h is mo&s;t commonly bak'd, being &s;ea|&s;on'd fir&s;t with water, and pepper, and &s;alt: the great Merchants who have Slaves to wait on them at the Table, do eat <HI>a l' Europeenne,</HI> and have their <HI>Ragousts</HI> as well made as in <HI>France,</HI> which they learn'd of us, and the Cook at the Fort of <HI>Den|mark;</HI> yet there are &s;ome <HI>Mores</HI> will make a <HI>Pottage,</HI> or a <HI>Ragou&s;t</HI> with the be&s;t <HI>Cui&s;inier</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<PB N="160" REF="85">
<P>They eat great &s;tore of fruit, of Peas, Beans, and &s;uch like: they make u&s;ually but two meals a day, that is, at Sun-ri&s;ing, and Sun-&s;et|ting, where they feed like Cormo|rants, and when they have eat ne|ver &s;o much, are hungry &s;till, which I impute to nothing but an exce&s;|&s;ive heat within them, which gives them a <HI>Canine,</HI> and perpetually in|&s;atiable appetite, in&s;omuch that I have ob&s;erved them when they have been at dinner a Ship-board, one Black has eat as much as &s;ix of us could do.</P>
<P>Their Mornings draught is either of water, or a kind of &s;mall beer, which they call <HI>Poitou,</HI> and is made of <HI>Mays,</HI> but 'tis night before they drink any Wine, and the rea&s;on is becau&s;e the Pea&s;ant never brings it to the Market till after dinner.</P>
<P>The Palm-Wine comes out of a Tree, not unlike our Date-trees;
<PB N="161" REF="85"> the <HI>Mores</HI> make a hole at the top of the tree, to which they fa&s;ten a pott, like one of the Monks pitch|ers, and the next day, or the day after, they find it full of a kind of juice like Milk, &s;weet and very plea&s;ant, but with a quality to in|ebriate The <HI>Mores</HI> have got a trick of late to &s;ophi&s;ticate it, and put water among&s;t it for their gain, but 'tis no hard matter to di&s;cover it. This Wine cannot be kept till next day, but will grow &s;ower in a nights time, upon which grounds, the Merchants, and other good fel|lows do meet, and drink &s;martly many times, but with this ceremony alwayes, that they leave a little in the bottome, which they throw upon the ground in honour of their <HI>Fetiches.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have no provi&s;ion, nor means to make any, are forc'd to buy what they want (at a little
<PB N="162" REF="86"> Market hard by) with what they have got by fi&s;hing, by making Palme-Wine, by building or re|pairing of hou&s;es, carrying home what the Merchants have bought on Ship-board, and &s;uch other &s;er|vile imployments as our Mecha|nicks in <HI>France</HI> live by: to which Market the Whites go al&s;o &s;ome|times when their Stomach hangs after fi&s;h.</P>

<P>THe be&s;t Market in all <HI>Africk</HI> is held every day at <HI>Cape-Cor&s;e,</HI> but we being at wars with <HI>England,</HI> I could have no &s;ight of that, and therefore mu&s;t be con|tented with the Market at <HI>Frede|risbourg,</HI> which is not indeed &s;o bigg, but there is the &s;ame thing ob&s;erved in a place de&s;igned for
<PB N="163" REF="86"> the &s;ame u&s;e, and that is, that it be ordinarily in the mid&s;t of the Town.</P>
<P>By break of day the Pea&s;ants come in with their Sugar-canes, bound up like Fagots, their fruits of all &s;orts, <HI>Plums, Potatoes, Turnips, Carrets, Citrons, Oranges, Rice, Mays, Malaguette, Bread, Pullets, Fi&s;h, Eggs,</HI> and whatever is nece&s;&s;ary for the life of man; after Dinner their Palme-wine comes in, and what Fi&s;h is taken &s;ince the morning.</P>
<P>They have never no confu&s;ion in their Markets, each Commodity has a peculiar place a&s;&s;igned for it by the Merchant, which is ob&s;er|ved with great order; their Tobac|co is &s;old in the leaf, which being dryed by the fire, they light it and &s;moak, their indu&s;try as yet not having been great enough to make it up into Rowls.</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch thing among&s;t them as tru&s;ting or credit, no Mo|ney
<PB N="164" REF="87"> no Merchandi&s;e there, every one brings his Gold in his hand. If the Commodity be of &s;mall price, they take their Gold and poi&s;e it upon the end of their finger, adding or &s;ub&s;tracting as they think fit; but if con&s;iderable, and of great value, they out with their Scales and weigh it.</P>
<P>Their Scales are made of two flat pieces of Copper &s;omething broad|er than our Crown pieces, which they hang by a thread at the end of a &s;hort &s;tick, and ballancing &s;o ex|actly, there can be nothing more true. Having no Needle, they make a noo&s;e of thread with their thumb and fa&s;ten to the middle, in which, in&s;tead of weights, they hang a certain red grain they call <HI>Tacous,</HI> each of which grains weighs about two-Penny weight, with which <HI>Pian Piano,</HI> they will weigh a <HI>Mark of Gold,</HI> yet there are
<PB N="165" REF="87"> &s;ome great Merchants which have Scales like ours, which they have bought lately of us.</P>
<P>All that comes to this Market, (which is kept every day in the week (<HI>Sunday</HI> excepted) is Tribute free, and pays no duty to the King.</P>
<P>There are others that re&s;emble our Fairs, and fall out not above twice in the year, to which all the whole Countrey repairs, for there is never in any of tho&s;e Kingdoms two Fairs kept in one day, left one &s;hould be a hindrance and di&s;ad|vantage to the other. By the report I have had, 'tis to the&s;e places they bring the be&s;t and fine&s;t of their things, and whatever they buy of us, as likewi&s;e to the ordinary Mar|kets which are kept farther up into the Countrey, but to tho&s;e Markets which are kept nearer the Sea, there is nothing comes but what is nece&s;|&s;ary to humane life, which the Pea|&s;ants

<PB N="167" REF="88"> to the Markets, and no man is per|mitted to traffick, unle&s;s it be tho&s;e upon the Sea &s;ide, who have liberty to go aboard, any Ve&s;&s;el in the Road, and to truck and make bar|gains as they plea&s;e. The re&s;t im|ploy their times wholly at their de|votions, and doe ob&s;erve it with much more punctuality then we doe our Sundays with us.</P>
<P>They meet altogether in a place, in the middle of which there is a great Tree, called the Tree of their <HI>Fetiche,</HI> of the barke off which they make the fillets, with which they bind their little pieces of Gold to their armes, and their leggs. At the foot of this Tree a Table is &s;pread, (the feet dre&s;t with &s;everal Crowns and Garlands made of the boughs of trees) upon which they &s;et Rice, Millet, Mays, Fruit, Meat, and Fi&s;h, with Wine, and Oyl of palmes, to eat and drink to their
<PB N="168" REF="89"> <HI>Fetiches,</HI> they dance, and &s;ing, and jump up and down all day about this Tree, making a mo&s;t ob&s;trepe|rous noi&s;e with Copper Ba&s;ons, and other in&s;truments for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>They wa&s;h their faces that mor|ning with particular care, and more exactly then all the week after. The fir&s;t bit of what ever they eat, they throw down upon the ground in honour of their Gods, and at night the Captain or the Governour di|&s;tributes Palme-Wine to all the In|habitants, the Pea&s;ants being obli|ged to bring it to him that evening.</P>
<P>Ask them about any thing of their faith, and they will look down upon the ground, but never give you an an&s;wer; only one of them told us that we had a very good God, that gave us &s;o many fine things: They all of them be|lieve an other life, but where, whe|ther above or below, they cannot
<PB N="169" REF="89"> tell. For which rea&s;on, le&s;t their Father or Mother &s;hould be hun|gry and &s;tarve, they put meat and Palme-Wine very often into their graves, to the end that if they be thir&s;ty or hungry, they may repair thither, and be relieved.</P>
<P>When they hear it thunder, rain hard, or the wind blow very &s;trong, there is not one of them to be &s;een in the &s;treets, all hide them&s;elves in their hou&s;es, and cry, <HI>the Gods of the Whites are angry.</HI> I ask'd one of them of what colour his God was, and he told me black: The Devil is &s;o dreadfull to them, they tremble at his very naming, they &s;ay he beats them, and makes them do ill things for their <HI>Feti|ches,</HI> for whom they have an incre|dible &s;uper&s;tition, though they be all of them inanimate, and &s;ome of them &s;o na&s;tily villanous, one would not touch them with a pair of tongs.</P>

<P>They tye this tree about (which is the place where they &s;acrifice) with little roaps of &s;traw, and after their Ceremonies are over, they take tho&s;e ropes, and &s;tringing their gold work upon them, they fa&s;ten them to their arms and leggs, and then think them&s;elves &s;afe again&s;t any mi&s;chief whatever.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ervation of their hou&s;es, they have a &s;ort of <HI>Fetiches</HI> which are planted at their dores, and they are no better than our poles, or hooks, we pull down the
<PB N="171" REF="90"> boughs withall when we gather our fruit: Of the&s;e <HI>Fetiches</HI> their Prie&s;ts &s;et a great number about a &s;tone, which (by their tradition) is as old as the world, and when they have been there a certain time, the Prie&s;ts &s;ell them to the people.</P>
<P>If at any time any trouble befall them, they repair immediately to their Prie&s;t, for a new <HI>Fetiche</HI> (the old one is to be tru&s;ted no longer) who mo&s;t graciou&s;ly &s;upplies them for their money, and into the bar|gain, <HI>he gives them a piece of Suet, or Tallow, with two or three Par|rets feathers &s;et right up, or el&s;e a certain hearb;</HI> the King of <HI>Fetu</HI>'s Son-in-Law had the head of an Ape for his <HI>Fetiche.</HI></P>
<P>They do all of them ab&s;tein from &s;omething or other, in ho|nour of their <HI>Fetiche,</HI> with this opi|nion, that if ever they eat or drink
<PB N="172" REF="91"> of that, after they promis'd ab&s;ti|nence (which is u&s;ually at their Marriage) they &s;hall dye upon the &s;pot; for which rea&s;on, one eats no Beef, another no Goat, ano|ther no Hens, this man drinks no Wine, and the other no Strong-waters, which they ob&s;erve &s;o exactly, they will &s;ooner dye than be per&s;waded or forc'd to the con|trary.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Fetiches</HI> I have &s;poken of hitherto, are but private <HI>Fetiches,</HI> and belong but to particular men: but they have another &s;ort of <HI>Feti|ches</HI> which are tutelary to the whole Countrey, as for example, &s;ometimes &s;uch a Mountain, &s;ome|times &s;uch a kind of Tree, &s;ome|times &s;uch a Stone, &s;ometimes &s;uch a &s;ort of Fi&s;h, or &s;uch a Species of Birds, which they look upon and wor&s;hip as &s;o many Gods. If a <HI>Negroe</HI> by accident kills any
<PB N="173" REF="91"> of tho&s;e Birds, he is puni&s;h'd &s;uf|ficiently, and if a White, he runs a great hazard of his life.

<P>The Con&s;ecrated Trees are or|dinarily tho&s;e about which their Sacrifices are perform'd; they be|lieve whoever cuts &s;uch a one down, de&s;troys (without more adoe) all the fruit in the Countrey: and therefore if there be any &s;uch Malefactors, they are puni&s;h'd with death, as it happen'd to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Moure</HI> in the year 1598, before they had built the
<PB N="174" REF="92"> Fort of <HI>Na&s;sau,</HI> where 8 or 10 of them were killed the 8th. of <HI>May,</HI> for having cut down a Tree dedi|cated to their <HI>Fetiches.</HI></P>
<P>The highe&s;t Mountains, and &s;uch as are mo&s;t &s;ubject to Thunder and Lightning, they imagine are the Re&s;idences of their Gods, and therefore they pay great honour and re&s;pect to them: at the bottom of them they will lay <HI>Rice, Millet, Mays, Bread, Wine, Oyl,</HI> and other things, that they may eat and drink if they be hungry or dry.</P>
<P>Their Stones (which they fan|cy to be <HI>Fetiches</HI>) are like our great Land-marks in the Countrey, (or &s;uch as are laid to di&s;tingui&s;h and determine the bounds or li|mits of a Countrey Pari&s;h) and they believe them as old as the world: about the&s;e it is their Prie&s;ts do &s;et their Cruches which they &s;ell afterwards to the people for

<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>April</HI> being at <HI>Frederisbourg,</HI> whil&s;t they were at Prayers above, I went down, and at the entrance of a hou&s;e which &s;tood alone by it &s;elf, I ob&s;erved a man and a woman, bleeding of a Hen (which they had prick'd on purpo&s;e) upon cer|tain leaves which they had plac'd upon the ground, and after it had done bleeding, they cut it into mamocks, threw them down upon the leaves, and then turning their faces upon one another, and ki&s;&s;ing their hands, they cry'd, <HI>Me Cu&s;a,
<PB N="176" REF="93"> Me Cu&s;a, Me Cu&s;a,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Make me good.</HI> I let them alone till their ceremony was done, and then ask'd them what they were about, they told me, that the <HI>Fetiche</HI> of that quar|ter had beaten them, and they by way of attonement, had given him a Hen for his dinner: As I was looking down upon their leaves, (or an herb rather which grows upon the Sea-&s;ide) they de&s;ired me not to touch them, and told me whoever eat of that Pullet, in half an hours time, would be as dead as a herring; but I was &s;o &s;tout-hear|ed, I took it up, had it broyl'd up|on the coales, by my Lacquey, eat|ing &s;ome part of it in their pre|&s;ence, and throwing the re&s;t to the piggs: the poor people were ama|zed, and &s;tood gaping to &s;ee me fall down dead, or &s;ink over head and ears into the earth immediate|ly.
<PB N="177" REF="93"> I ask'd them to &s;ee their <HI>Fetiche,</HI> they carried me into a little Court, to a kind of a Tyle wrapt about with &s;traw, and told me that was the <HI>Fetiche</HI> which had beaten them. Well &s;aid I, I'le be reveng'd, and throwing it on the ground, I break it into a hundred pieces, and planted a Cro&s;s in the Room on't. I taught them to &s;igne them&s;elves al&s;o, broak all their Cruches about the door, and having given them each a little cro&s;s for their pockets, and bid them when ever the <HI>Fe|tiche</HI> came to plague them again, that they &s;hould &s;igne them&s;elves with the &s;igne of the Cro&s;s, take that out and ki&s;s it, and they &s;hould hear no more of their <HI>Fe|tiche</HI> ever after; they heard me very patiently, and made &s;uch re|lations at home, that a whole Church of them came to me next day, de&s;iring to &s;wop a <HI>Fetiche</HI> for
<PB N="178" REF="94"> a Crucifix: We came immediate|ly to a bargain, and when I began to examine my <HI>Fetiche,</HI> I found it nothing but a piece of putrified earth, nointed over with &s;uet, and grea&s;e, and oyl of Palmes, with five or &s;ix Parrot-feathers bolt upright in the middle, to which morning and night they pay'd their con|&s;tant devotions.</P>
<P>I per&s;waded them afterwards to &s;hew me to their <HI>Fetiche General,</HI> which they did: I found it in a plain where they made all their Sacrifices; it was nothing but a &s;tone covered with earth, which I routed immediately, and brake five hundred of their poles which they had planted about it; from thence I went to their Prie&s;t, to &s;ee what <HI>Fetiches</HI> he had to &s;ell, he told me I had one, which was one of the poles I had brought along in my hand, and would have had me
<PB N="179" REF="94"> pay'd him for't: I took him by the elbow, and carry'd him to the <HI>Ma|ster Fetiche,</HI> and when he &s;aw he was demoli&s;h'd, Lord! what a pickle he was in, he roar'd and cry'd out to his Neighbours, and all of them look'd upon it as a mi|racle that I was not as dead as a door-nail in the twinkling of an eye. I told him, Sir, for your pay|ment I have &s;et up this Cro&s;s, and who&s;oever touches it (unle&s;s upon the knee) is a dead man in a mi|nute; at which words, they ran home as fa&s;t as they could, yelling and crying out to one another, whil&s;t I return'd to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>They have &s;o great an opinion, and veneration for their Prie&s;ts, the whole world is not able to di&s;abu&s;e them: if they have one bit better than other, 'tis kept for them; they are the only people among&s;t the <HI>Mores,</HI> that are &s;uffer'd not to
<PB N="180" REF="95"> work, are nouri&s;h'd at others co&s;t, and chare&s;s'd all ways they can think of, to the end they may af|ford them their prayers. They &s;ell <HI>Fetiches</HI> (as I have &s;aid before) to the common people, per&s;wading them, they found them hanging upon the <HI>Fetiches</HI> Tree, which they believe &s;o ob&s;tinately, their own eyes are not &s;ufficient to con|vince them; for if at any time they &s;ee the contrary, they will &s;ooner believe it an illu&s;ion, than imagine their Prie&s;ts would deceive them: &s;o blind are the&s;e poor people, be|ing led by tho&s;e who are blinder than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Habit of their Prie&s;ts re|&s;embles a Coat of Arms, and is made of &s;ome cour&s;e linnen, or &s;erge, about which they have a &s;carf, &s;et with little bones of broyl'd Pullets, like the Cockle-&s;hells worn by the Pilgrims of St. <HI>Mi|chael;</HI>

<P>For my part, I believe they are made all of them by the Prie&s;t, and that they talk and conver&s;e with the Devil, who communicates with them, and teaches them which way to cheat the people &s;o ea&s;ily; and that which makes me &s;ay it, is this, they alwayes mutter out &s;ome words to their <HI>Fetiches,</HI> before they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">them.</P>

<P>THeir Super&s;tition towards their <HI>Fetiches,</HI> is &s;o po&s;itive, and dogmatical, nothing in this world is able to convince them.

I had a great mind (upon the tidings) to be pre&s;ent at the Ceremony; I went in, and found a Faggot of Thorns in a Basket which a Slave carried under his arm, covered over with a Skin, I made bold to uncover it, and in the middle of the Fag|got, I &s;aw a piece of Suet and Wax, with Parrots Feathers, little burnt bones of Pullets, Plumes of the Bird which was <HI>Fetichi&s;&s;i|mo</HI> of that Countrey, and &s;everal other na&s;tie things with them.

<P>Be&s;ides the wayes of appea&s;ing their <HI>Fetiches,</HI> which I have menti|oned before, they have other whim|&s;eys as memorable: If they have not &s;o good fortune a fi&s;hing, as they u&s;e to have, they imagine their <HI>Fe|tiche</HI> is offended, and has driven them away.

<P>The General of <HI>Frederisbourg,</HI> having notice that there was one of them dead in the Ca&s;tle, gave me adverti&s;ement immediately that I might be pre&s;ent at the Funeral Ceremonies, a thing which the <HI>Mores</HI> will never permit, but by con&s;traint.</P>
<P>When any one dyes among&s;t them, they put the body into a Coffin made of O&s;iers, the barke

<P>If it be a woman that dyes, her daughter or &s;ome other woman, (for the men are never called to their funerals) goes from hou&s;e to hou&s;e complaining and making her moan, and with the gold &s;he finds about her, or in the hou&s;e, buys an Ox or a Sheep, which &s;he gives to the Prie&s;t, to pray to the <HI>Fetiche</HI> of the dead per&s;on, to con|duct her into a place of repo&s;e: the Prie&s;t orders this Ox, or Mutton, to be killed, and then &s;prinkling the blood about in honour to her <HI>Fetiche,</HI> he begs of it, that it would not interrupt her in her pa&s;&s;age to
<PB N="191" REF="100"> the other world, and that it would pardon whatever &s;he had done ami&s;s.

<P>This Ceremony being over, the body is expos'd about half a day, with the head bound about, and the arms extended, after which the women carry it to the place of its Sepulture (it being their Province to bury the dead) the men never &s;tirring in that ca&s;e, unle&s;s the bu|rial be to be in &s;ome other Village,

<P>The Corps being brought to the place of its Burial, the men which inhabited there, digged a hole of about four or five foot deep, and put it in, but &s;o, as the Earth came not near it, then turning about the Grave, they bid him adieu, with great noi&s;e and ejulation; that Wife which he had mo&s;t kind|ne&s;s for, threw his <HI>Fetiches</HI> into the hole, and at la&s;t laid a good part of his hou&s;hold|&s;tuff (as his Kettles and Cloaths) by his &s;ide, and his Arms a top on him: if he loved any thing more
<PB N="194" REF="102"> than ordinary, as Palm-wine, or any thing el&s;e, they plac'd it by him, with Rice, Millet, Mays, and what|ever they thought nece&s;&s;ary for the life of man, that he might want nothing whither he was a going.

<P>As to the worms which grow betwixt the skin and the fle&s;h, Fo|reigners are as much &s;ubject to them, as they: they breed over all the body, but principally in the thighs, legs, and mo&s;t fle&s;hy parts.

The ill water they drink, toge|ther with the na&s;tine&s;s of their diet, may add &s;omething, but 'tis the nipping Winds and Rains which fall upon the Coa&s;t, and
<PB N="203" REF="106"> makes tho&s;e parts &s;o &s;ubject to worms: in <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> (which are the mo&s;t rainy months among&s;t them) experience tells us, tho&s;e worms are mo&s;t apt to engen|der. In &s;hort, every drop of their Rain is bigger than a large Pea: if in a &s;hower of that nature, one be wet never &s;o little, and lets his clothes dry upon his back, be&s;ides that in three dayes his clothes &s;hall be rotten, if he has no worms, he &s;hall be &s;ure of a di&s;temper that will be very dangerous.</P>
<P>We may affirm therefore 'tis the rain, as well as the dew, which produces the&s;e worms, how, or which way, I leave to the Phi|lo&s;opher, and Phy&s;ician to re&s;olve; but this I am &s;ure, having many times put out a bit of fle&s;h in the rain, or in the evening dew, I found as &s;oon as the beams of the Sun glanced but upon it, it turned
<PB N="204" REF="107"> all into Worms, which experi|ment I made very often, &amp; am con|vinced by it, that they come but tho&s;e two ways, either by the rain or the dew. Of tho&s;e Worms which grow in the body, there are two &s;orts, one le&s;&s;er, the other greater, and &s;ome of them as &s;lender as a hair; the lea&s;t are half a foot long, the larger a foot, and &s;ome there are of an ell, but very rarely.</P>
<P>When you are once plagued with them, there is nothing to be done till they are out, which is evident by the tumours they rai&s;e in the fle&s;h, and the &s;welling of the part where they lie. There is nothing like keeping ones bed, and opening the corner of the skin gently with a knife to give them free pa&s;&s;age, if they perceive them advancing, they may ha&s;ten their journey, and pull them out by little and little, if they find any
<PB N="205" REF="107"> &s;top or reluctance in the Worm, they mu&s;t let them alone (le&s;t they break them) and tye a hair or piece of &s;ilk about them, to keep them from going back: &s;ometimes &s;eve|ral of them will come out at one hole, but they mu&s;t have patience, for their motion is but &s;low: above all things they mu&s;t have a care of breaking them, for they are of &s;o venemous a quality, there is no way to pre&s;erve the per&s;on again&s;t its virulence, but by cutting off the part. When they are out, they u&s;u|ally rub the place with butter and &s;alt, and wa&s;h it with Sea-water, which in that ca&s;e is &s;overaign.</P>
<P>Their be&s;t way to &s;ecure them|&s;elves again&s;t them, is to put file-du&s;t into their breeches and &s;hooes to keep their feet dry, and if at any time they be wet, to change their clothes and their drawers immediately, by no means to &s;leep
<PB N="206" REF="108"> upon the ground, to have a care of the <HI>Seraine</HI> or evenings dew, to bind them&s;elves up clo&s;e, and keep their &s;tomachs warm, to ab&s;tein from Women, to u&s;e confection of <HI>Hyacinth, Alkermes,</HI> or <HI>Clarie,</HI> to keep ones &s;elf clean, avoid the raine, which the <HI>Mores</HI> are as feard of as the Plague, &s;hutting up them&s;elves as &s;oon as it begins but to mizzle; if one be wett, to dry his cloths, and by the&s;e ob&s;ervati|ons they may be probably prevent|ed.

<P>THe Inhabitants of the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africk,</HI> are great lovers of Mu&s;ick, and &s;ongs, but e&s;pe|cially of dancing, in which they &s;pend two or three hours every evening before they go to bed: to this purpo&s;e the men and women both, dre&s;s them&s;elves as fine as they can, putting on their bracelets of Gold and Ivory, and trimming up their hair; the men carry little fanns in their hands, made of the tayls of Elephants, or Hor&s;es, (like the boa&s;om of feathers wherewith pictures are du&s;ted, &s;aving that the&s;e are gilt at both ends) and meet all at a place about Sun-&s;et; Being come together, tho&s;e who make the Mu&s;ick, draw into a cor|ner by them&s;elves, their In&s;tru|ments

Their Trum|pets are of Elephants teeth made hollow: we perceived pre&s;ently it was the Kings Son-in-Law, with his Drum before him, 15 or 20 Trumpets, about 12 of his Wives, and about 60 Slaves after him, two of which attended him with great
<PB N="211" REF="110"> Bucklers, carried on purpo&s;e to co|ver him, and two others with his, Darts, his Bow, and his Arrows. The Women were dre&s;t in Da|mask and Taffaties, which they wrapt about them from their brea&s;ts to their mid-legg, wearing &s;everal <HI>Fetiches</HI> upon their heads, &s;everal little plates of gold in bracelets, a|bout their wri&s;ts and ankles, or el&s;e of <HI>Ra&s;ade</HI> or Ivory, their hair very well dre&s;t, according to the mode of that Countrey: the Kings Son in-Law had a piece of blew Taffaty about his wa&s;t, who&s;e two ends were drawn betwixt his leggs, and trail'd almo&s;t upon the ground. Be|fore him he had a little faulchion carried, he had a Cap trim'd with pieces of the skulls of &s;uch per&s;ons as he had killed, and covered all o|ver with plumes of feathers: on his arms and his leggs, he had &s;eve|ral little pieces of gold excellently
<PB N="212" REF="111"> well wrought, and two little fanns in his hands made of hor&s;e-hair; When they were received into the Court, after a hundred &s;houts and acclamations, the men put them|&s;elves on one &s;ide, the women on the other, and the Slaves, Trum|pets, and Drums behind him, who &s;ounded as they pa&s;s'd, and made all the noi&s;e and clamour was po&s;|&s;ible; having &s;eparated them&s;elves, they began their approaching, and retiring with great exactne&s;s, tur|ning them&s;elves this way and that way about half a quarter of an hour: after this he gave his 2 fanns to one of his Slaves, and taking his Dart in his hand, he pretended to dart it at the women, who were do|ing the &s;ame thing on their &s;ide; but the Slaves got about him, and cover'd him quite with their buck|lers: this having la&s;ted a pritty while, on a &s;udden he claps his

<HEAD>Of their Exerci&s;es, their Workmen, their Trades, their Merchandi&s;es, their Fi&s;hing, which way it is u&s;ed and the Duty they pay to their King.</HEAD>
<P>AS they have &s;everal Trades and imployments among&s;t them, &s;o are they very con&s;tantly imploy'd, e&s;pecially if there be no Ships upon their Coa&s;ts to divert them. They have Gold&s;miths which work very curiou&s;ly, they have Carpenters that make their <HI>Canoes,</HI> they have people that Fi&s;h, they have others that cut down their wood, the women in the mean time keeping their Markets, and &s;elling their Commodities to Merchants which come higher out of the Countrey.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who come aboard to ne|gotiate with us are commonly Offi|cers, or Captains of &s;ome Town,
<PB N="215" REF="112"> who are all of them Merchants: their manner of coming aboard us, is in a little <HI>Canoe,</HI> very neatly made, rowed by two <HI>Mores,</HI> the Merchant in the middle upon a little chair, with his &s;word lying by him.</P>
<P>Being of &s;everal places, they have a different way of Trading, tho&s;e who live farther up the Countrey, and are neither acquainted with the language, nor manner of Com|merce, which is practis'd by the Whites, are con&s;train'd to make u&s;e of a &s;ort of Brokers to negotiate for them, and do u&s;ually give them good recompence for their pains; this is an advantage accrews parti|cularly to &s;uch as live near the Sea-&s;ide, and (&s;o generally are they de|voted to their profit) the greate&s;t Merchants among&s;t them will not refu&s;e the imployment, if there be the lea&s;t pro&s;pect and expectation of gain.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="113">
<P>Mo&s;t commonly, it is tho&s;e who live upon the Coa&s;ts, or within 10 leagues di&s;tance of the Sea, that buy up the Commodities which are brought in by &s;uch Ships as come into their Roads, and &s;ell them af|terwards when the Ships are gone, to the Inlanders, &s;eldome for le&s;s profit than &s;ix <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>Having been deceived &s;ometimes formerly, they are now grown &s;o &s;ubtil and wary, there is no cheat|ing them any more; it is our bu&s;i|ne&s;s now rather to be upon our guards, le&s;t they be too cunning for us. They have &s;o great judgment &amp; in&s;ight into Merchandi&s;e, they will di&s;tingui&s;h whether a piece of Saye be dyed at <HI>Leyden</HI> or <HI>Harlem.</HI></P>
<P>When their bargains are made, and their bu&s;ine&s;s done, they fall a begging and bawling for &s;ome pre|&s;ent or other (which they call <HI>Da|che</HI>) and will never be &s;atisfyed
<PB N="217" REF="113"> without it. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> brought up this Cu&s;tom at fir&s;t, to cajole, and work them off from the <HI>Portu|gais:</HI> But what they did volunta|rily then, is become now &s;uch a Cu&s;tome, that &s;ome of the <HI>Mores</HI> are &s;o confident, as to demand what pre&s;ent they &s;hall have, be|fore they will admit any propo&s;i|tion of Traffick.</P>
<P>They have one pretty odd kind of &s;uper&s;tition among&s;t them, if a Merchant &s;neezes as he comes out of his hou&s;e, and turns his head by accident, towards the right hand, (which they call <HI>Eninfan</HI>) they believe they &s;hall run a great hazard of lo&s;ing their goods that day. If he turns it to the left (which they call <HI>Abnicon</HI>) though they were &s;ure to gain the profits of a Kingdom, they would not &s;tir out that day from their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>When they return from our Ship
<PB N="218" REF="114"> they have alwayes &s;tore of boys, &amp; young fellows attending upon the &s;hore, to carry the Commodities they have bought to their hou&s;es, for which the Merchant gives them &s;ome little pieces of gold as a reward. Tho&s;e who live higher up the Countrey have all their Com|modities brought down upon the backs of their Slaves, making no u&s;e of hor&s;e, or any other Creature in that bu&s;ine&s;s, which is no &s;mall inconvenience to a Merchant that comes a hundred leagues to us cro&s;s the Countrey, and forces them to travel with their Arms.</P>
<P>Fi&s;hing being their principal im|ployment, every morning there are twenty or thirty <HI>Canoes</HI> to be &s;een &s;ailing out of their harbours, &amp; di|viding them&s;elves in&s;tantly into all quarters when they come out to Sea. In each of them they have com|monly two men, one to fi&s;h, &amp; the
<PB N="219" REF="114"> other to manage the <HI>Canoe,</HI> and by them they have their &s;words and their Victuals. Their <HI>Canoes</HI> are ve|ry neat and beautiful, painted and adorned with all po&s;&s;ible care; they fa&s;ten <HI>Fetiches</HI> to them, to pre|&s;erve them from &s;torms &amp; di&s;a&s;ters, and when they have done fi&s;hing, they draw them up under a place on purpo&s;e to keep them dry. They are &s;o light, two men will carry one of them as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In this manner they go a fi&s;hing every morning, yet not &s;o much by de&s;ign, as by natural impul&s;e, the wind from the hills forcing them as it were to Sea, and altering at night, and blowing hard upon the &s;hore, they are brought home again by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity and violence: and this they do con&s;tantly every day but <HI>Sunday,</HI> never failing when the weather will endure it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t general way of fi&s;h|ing,
<PB N="220" REF="115"> is with little hooks, of which they fa&s;ten twenty (&s;ometimes) to one line; others make u&s;e of lines with a kind of &s;lipping noo&s;es, but this is as rarely at Sea, as it is ordinary in their Rivers, and Lakes within Land. They are much delighted with fi&s;hing in the night, which they do by the light of Torches greas'd over with Oyl of Palm, or Ro&s;en, hooking the fi&s;h up as they come near them. Others go up to the bellies into the Sea, with a lighted Torch in one hand, and a Net in the other, which they throw over them with great dexterity: and from hence we may collect how indu&s;trious they are, neglecting no time, nor labour to get them&s;elves a lively|hood. At their return, they are attended by &s;everal boyes, who are alwaies waiting in the harbour to help them home with their fi&s;h,
<PB N="221" REF="115"> and to make up their Lines and their Nets for them, for which pains, they u&s;ually gratifie them with &s;ome little pre&s;ent of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>But the Fi&s;herman and Merchant are no &s;ooner return'd, but the Re|ceiver of the Office (in which the Duties and Cu&s;toms are paid; for the King in who&s;e Dominion that Port is) &s;tands ready alwaies to receive them, and to carry with him a full third of whatever they bring on &s;hore) to bring the Mer|chant to a higher compo&s;ition, for there being no fix'd prices &s;et, it is the Merchants bu&s;ine&s;s to get off as cheap, and the Receivers to hoi&s;t him as high as he can: be&s;ides the&s;e duties, the foreign Merchants which are not of that Kingdom, are oblig d &s;ometimes to give a Mark of gold more for a free pa&s;|&s;age through the territories of the neighbouring Princes.</P>
<PB N="222" REF="116">
<P>But tho&s;e who live upon the Sea-&s;ide, are exempted from any tribute in this nature, provided the worth of their Merchandi&s;e exceeds not two ounces of gold at one time, if it does, they pay as other people.</P>
<P>The duty upon their fi&s;h is paid punctually to the Receiver every day, who as punctually &s;ends it every day to the King; not one Fi&s;herman daring under a great penalty, to &s;ell one mor&s;ell till it be paid, this tribute being de&s;ign|ed to the &s;u&s;tenance of his Royal Family; for which rea&s;on, what|ever fi&s;h is taken, is brought im|mediately to the Office, where the Receiver has a great mea&s;ure about the bigne&s;s of a Peck, which he fills and delivers frankly to the Fi&s;herman; that done, he mea|&s;ures the re&s;t, and re&s;erves a fifth part for the King, which is &s;ent away pre&s;ently by the Slaves for

<P>The King of <HI>Fetu</HI> as they repre|&s;ented him to me, is no unhand&s;ome man, he is a great lover of the Whites, &amp; has expre&s;t it upon &s;e|veral occa&s;ions; he is about five &amp; forty, or fifty years old, Maje&s;tick, requires honour and re&s;pect, rich, and very liberal, he has come many times to vi&s;it the Governour of <HI>Fre|derisbourg,</HI> &amp; made him &s;everal pre|&s;ents: Liberality is very ordinary in the&s;e parts, and u&s;ed, to inveigle the
<PB N="225" REF="117"> people, and oblige them to parties: He keeps a great Court, pa&s;&s;ing a|way the time in drinking &amp; laugh|ing in a great Hall in the middle of his Palace; about Sun-&s;et he &s;ets him&s;elf down at the Gate, dre&s;t ve|ry &s;ine, with his bracelets and neck|laces of Gold, &amp; clad in the riche&s;t habits can be bought for money; in this manner, if he be at peace, he pa&s;&s;es away his time with his La|dies, who&s;e principal bu&s;ine&s;s is to wa&s;h and keep him neat again&s;t night, at which time he has dan|cing con&s;tantly and balls.</P>
<P>His &s;ubjects have all of them a great veneration for him, &amp; are in much aw and apprehen&s;ion of his di&s;plea&s;ure, by rea&s;on that whoever among&s;t them has but once di&s;|obey'd their King, he is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> by the Laws of that Kingdome; made incapable of any publick of|fice.

<P>He has alwayes a great number of Slaves and Souldiers guarding his Palace, which is very large, and neat, and incomparably much hand&s;omer than a hou&s;e he has near the Sea-&s;ide: it con&s;i&s;ts of a|bove two hundred chambers, and is built in the mid&s;t of a Town, with large Courts round about it; when he goes abroad, he is always attended and carried upon the &s;houlders of his Slaves, all people endeavouring to plea&s;e him where|ever he comes.</P>
<P>To gain the affections of his Courtiers, and the Grandees of his Countrey, above all things it is nece&s;&s;ary he be Noble, for they hate avarice, and look upon it as ignominious in a great per&s;on, on whom all people do depend, to be too par&s;imoniou&s;ly intent upon
<PB N="227" REF="118"> hoording up Gold; Yet this libera|lity that is look'd for, con&s;i&s;ts only in treatings &amp; banquets, which he makes very often for them, &amp; if the Whites at any time make him a pre&s;ent, he di&s;tributes it among&s;t them, if it be of Strong-waters, he drinks it merrily among&s;t them, preferring their company, in that ca&s;e, to his Wives and Children, to whom notwith&s;tanding he al|lows a proportion.</P>
<P>He has as many Wives as he plea|&s;es, who are all di&s;po&s;ed into &s;everal appartements, with whom he dines or &s;ups &s;ometimes as he thinks good, but very &s;eldom, when they go abroad, they are carried likewi&s;e on the &s;houlders of their Slaves: they are abundantly proud, and im|ploy their whole time in diverting and indulging the King; &s;ome of them are admitted into his compa|ny after dinner in the great Hall,

<P>THe Gold which is tran&s;port|ed in &s;o great quantities from the&s;e Coa&s;ts, that it gives them the Epithet of <HI>Golden,</HI> is taken in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>The Gold of <HI>Axime</HI> is reckon'd the be&s;t, and is oftentimes found in pieces of two and twenty, or three and twenty Carrets.</P>
<P>The Gold of <HI>Acara</HI> or <HI>Ta&s;ore,</HI> is &s;omething le&s;s: that of <HI>Acanis</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="137"> and <HI>Achema</HI> is next, and the wor&s;t of all is the Gold of <HI>Fetu.</HI></P>
<P>The manner of taking it, is known only by the report of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> and (if they &s;peak truth) is &s;everal wayes.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>Axime</HI> and <HI>Achema</HI> find it in the &s;ands of their Rivers, in powder: &amp; 'tis to be &s;uppo&s;ed would they dig at the feet of the Moun|tains where the&s;e Rivers ari&s;e, 'tis probable they would meet with greater proportions, &s;eeing by their own confe&s;&s;ions, after a lu&s;ty &s;hower their plenty is increa&s;t, up|on which &s;core they have this &s;u|per&s;tition among&s;t them, that when they want Gold, they pray to their <HI>Fetiches</HI> to &s;end them good &s;tore of rain, and they are &s;ure to be &s;up|ply'd, as I hinted before.</P>
<P>The Gold of <HI>Acara</HI> comes from the Mountain of <HI>Taffou,</HI> &s;ome thirty leagues di&s;tance, from the Town,
<PB N="266" REF="138"> which is three dayes journey up in the Countrey: One of the Cap|tains of the Blacks had a great de|&s;ire to have carried me to the place, &amp; would have le&s;t the Kings Brother and Son in ho&s;tage: but the water &s;ailing as we were ready to go, we could not proceed in our de&s;ign. He told us that the Mine belonged to the King, that there was no more to be done but to dig about the Mountain, and they would have gold enough; that tho&s;e who found it were to have one Moyety, and the King the o|ther, that he had an ingot of gold before his gate, which by the uni|ver&s;al confe&s;&s;ion of all the <HI>Negroes,</HI> was bigger than the <HI>Fetiche</HI> of the whole Countrey, and taken out of this Mountain.</P>
<P>An Officer at <HI>Frederisbourg,</HI> who has been &s;everal times at <HI>Fetu</HI> and <HI>Acanis,</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, that tho&s;e
<PB N="267" REF="138"> two Kings had each of them before the gates of their Palaces, a golden <HI>Fetiche</HI> of a va&s;t bigne&s;s, not &s;o big indeed as that of the King of <HI>Fetu,</HI> but yet full as big as a Peck.</P>
<P>The gold of <HI>Acanis</HI> and <HI>Fetu,</HI> is found in the earth by digging, &s;ome|times more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s; he which di&s;covers a Mine has one half, &amp; the King the other: it is ne|ver above twenty or one &amp; twenty Carrets; it is melted down at nei|ther place, but brought to us aboard as it is taken out of the ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> General has an in|got of gold, taken out of the Moun|tain of <HI>Tafou,</HI> which weighs &s;even|teen Marks, and about the &s;eventh part of an Ounce. It was a pre&s;ent &s;ent him by the King of <HI>Acara,</HI> when his Army was beaten by the Seigneur of <HI>Acara,</HI> and he protect|ed him in his Fort.</P>
<P>When the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Por|tugais</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="139"> frequented the&s;e Coa&s;ts, the Natives knew not the value of their gold, but &s;ince other Nations have been admitted, (and the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> e&s;pecially) they have learn'd, by their earne&s;t de&s;ire to have it, that 'tis of more price, and do now hold it &s;o dear, and &s;tand &s;o high in their demands, 'tis al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that, they have found out new ways of increa&s;ing their quan|tities by adulterating it, and ming|ling it with little pieces of Copper, which they call <HI>Quaquara,</HI> or other|wi&s;e with Bra&s;s: the chief place for this Artifice is <HI>Commendo,</HI> where I may &s;ay boldly, there are the be&s;t cheats in the world.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e practices are only a|mong&s;t the le&s;&s;er &s;ort of Merchants of whom great care is to be taken, for they are &s;o ingenious in this kind, there is not a cheat or for|gery
<PB N="269" REF="139"> that can fall under the inven|tion of mankind, which they do not u&s;e for the circumvention of &s;tran|gers.</P>

Among&s;t o|ther things, they make great quan|tities of Bracelets of poli&s;h'd Gold, and of tho&s;e <HI>Fetiches</HI> which they wear upon their heads, as thin as paper: But above all things they tran&s;cend in their hatbands, which they make of threads as fine as any hair. Their Kings have their Ve&s;&s;els in Gold &s;till, their
<PB N="270" REF="140"> working Gold&s;miths making eve|ry thing they fancy, and every thing that comes into their heads.</P>
<P>The Wives and Daughters of their Kings, Merchants, and Nobi|lity of that Country, are &s;o well la|den with Rings, Bracelets, &amp; <HI>Feti|ches</HI> of Gold, e&s;pecially when they go to their <HI>Balls,</HI> that they have &s;ometimes in &s;uch trifles, to the weight of 20, or 25 Marks of Gold, and the men to thirty or forty.</P>
<P>It is &s;o incredibly plentiful in tho&s;e parts, that a King upon an or|dinary Fe&s;tival will di&s;tribute two hundred Marks of Gold among&s;t his Courtiers, and &s;ometimes more; for which rea&s;on, the <HI>Negroes</HI> de|light to have liberal Kings, that their large&s;&s;es may be more fre|quent, and the Gold (not being lockt up in their private Coffers) may expend and circulate through the whole Kingdome.</P>
<PB N="271" REF="140">
<P>Nor is the dearne&s;s of their pro|vi&s;ions, a &s;mall argument of the plenty afore&s;aid; a Frica&s;&s;ee of Pul|lets bought of the <HI>Mores</HI> will co&s;t two Crowns at lea&s;t, a Pot of their Palm-wine, as it comes intirely from the tree, a Crown, and is no more than three of our <HI>Chopines</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> 'Tis true among&s;t them&s;elves things are not altogether &s;o dear, but having taken up an opinion that the Whites make treble advan|tage of whatever they buy of them, they &s;ell every thing they can po&s;&s;ibly at that rate to them: their fi&s;h is &s;omewhat cheaper indeed, &amp; for ten pence one may have as much as will &s;uffice ten men.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the pains I did take, I could never inform my &s;elf further concerning their Gold, or their manner of taking it out of the Mines: talk to a thou&s;and per&s;ons of it, and they will all
