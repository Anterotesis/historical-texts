<P>_FOra&s;much as <HI>(Noble Reader) Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2.</NOTE> the City of our God, even upon his holy mountain the joy of the whole earth, and the City of the great King, that fair and mo&s;t ancient City, by a &s;pecial Prerogative is by God him&s;elfe beautified above all other Cities, and was therefore the chief, mo&s;t noble and famous City of the world: Many Travellers and Pilgrims, have at &s;undry times, both in Maps and Hi&s;tories, de&s;cribed the &s;ame. By the advantage of who&s;e labours therein, now of late years, one <HI>Chri&s;tian Adrichom,</HI> [Anno <HI>1585.</HI>] hath performed a mo&s;t lively de&s;cription, and in the Latine tongue, enriched with divers Antiquities. The profit that might come hereby to my Country-men of the vulgar &s;ort, both for the better under&s;tanding of the &s;tory of the Bible, where <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the parts thereof are oftentimes mentioned, and al&s;o for the ready conceiving of <HI>Jo&s;ephus his hi&s;tory,</HI> moved me to tran&s;late it into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue: And the book thus tran&s;lated, with the charts expre&s;&s;ed in natural colours, I have pre&s;umed to pre&s;ent unto your view.

<PB REF="3">the Ma&s;ter-workman in this new plat of old decayed <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> hath left behind him &s;ome rubbi&s;h and relicks of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> &s;uper&s;tition; I have in &s;ome mea&s;ure purged and &s;wept the &s;treets and corners of the &s;ame, with the broom of truth, and carrying them out by the Scoure-gate, or Dung-gate, have laid them on the Ley&s;tall of oblivion <HI>[and as for &s;ome that do yet remain, here is now left a purgation, by addition of Annotations.]</HI> My pains herein taken, though not &s;o great, as the laying of <HI>Jeru&s;alems</HI> founda|tion, or the rai&s;ing of a chief corner &s;tone, or the &s;quaring and fini&s;hing any part of this exqui&s;ite plat: yet &s;uch it is, as even in the meane&s;t degree of a poor labourer, that doth but &s;weep the &s;treets, I be&s;eech you to accept as a &s;mall mite of my good will. The which I gladly offer, to the end that amid&s;t the burdens and &s;nares of your worldly affairs, you beholding this mo&s;t brave City, adorned with &s;o glorious a Temple, and contemplating the Pa&s;sion of our Saviour Chri&s;t therein, may be delighted and recreated: And fur|ther, that viewing this terre&s;trial City, who&s;e glory is now vani&s;hed, you may think &s;till as the Apo&s;tle did &s;ay, <HI>Non habe|mus hic manentem civitatem [We have not here an abiding City,</HI> Heb. <HI>13.14.]</HI> and &s;o a&s;pire to that heaven|ly <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> garni&s;hed, and full &s;tored with all manner of delights, which abideth for ever; Wherein I do mo&s;t humbly and heartily wi&s;h you a mo&s;t happy re&s;idence, after you have performed your &s;hort cour&s;e in this life, in the &s;ervice of your God, and of your friends and Country, and the general benefit, and comfort of your own &s;oule.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Author <HI>Chri. Andric.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>_FOr&s;omuch as the truth of Hi&s;tory, is the foundation of faith, and of &s;piritual un|der&s;tanding (Chri&s;tian Reader) and the hi&s;tory of things done, blind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron. Tom. <HI>3.</HI> Epi&s;. <HI>27.</HI> ad Dard.</NOTE> and imper|fect, without the knowledge of places, the which knowledge giveth much light, both to the truth of Hi&s;tory, and al&s;o to the &s;pirituall interpretation there|of;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;cope of this Book.</NOTE> therefore I have thought good to ob&s;erve two things with great diligence in this work. Fir&s;t, that I might portray and &s;et forth the true and lively Image of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> of all other Cities the mo&s;t glorious and famous throughout the whole world, whereof mention is made in &s;acred and in prophane hi&s;tories, as it flouri&s;hed in Chri&s;t his time; and al&s;o the forme of the Temple (the fame whereof hath been extolled above the heavens, and was worthy of eternal me|mory) by the &s;acred Scriptures, by approved Writers, and by ancient tradition of faithful and tru&s;ty men, in a lively plot, or Map, mo&s;t exqui&s;itly drawn, together with the names, originals, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ituations, and forms of every place, and the mo&s;t worthy Hi&s;tories concerning the &s;ame, with all brevity. Secondly, that I might rightly di&s;po&s;e the places of Chri&s;t his Pa&s;&s;ion, and repre&s;ent every thing which he &s;uffered in every place, even as if they were now done before our eyes, and &s;o repre&s;ented, that I might explain it with plainne&s;s and brevity. For hereby all tho&s;e things which he &s;uffer|ed
<PB REF="4">for our &s;akes, will be both more plainly under&s;tood, and al&s;o more profitably remembred. But peradventure there will be &s;ome which will mi&s;like this our endea|vour, and the rather becau&s;e we have many things by tradition of Elders; to whom I an&s;wer out of <HI>Hierom,</HI> where he &s;aith, <HI>That Eccle&s;ia&s;tical traditions, which are no hindrance to faith, are &s;o to be kept, as they were delivered by the Ancients.</HI> In the mean time I will not &s;ay, that they are too ra&s;h, and too too wicked, which will de|ny that thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. Tom. <HI>1.</HI> Epist. <HI>28.</HI> ad L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cinium.</NOTE> which hath been godly received at all times, and of all men. So many of us therefore as are wa&s;hed with the bloud of Chri&s;t, doe bear his name, and are called Chri&s;tians, if our faith the an&s;wering to our name, and our life, not di&s;agreeing from the truth, hoping to be &s;aved by the merits and grace of Chri&s;t our Saviour, let us beleeve that, which incorrupt and reverend Antiquity hath left, let us in no wi&s;e depart from tho&s;e things [which our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> have celebrated without any &s;uper&s;tition, &amp;] w^c^h by the con&s;ent of the whole world, are come even from them to our hands, and with thankfull godline&s;&s;e, and godly thankfulne&s;s, let us call to minde tho&s;e places oftentimes, which may put us in remembrance of the Pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t; to which places this Map will lead us, as it were by the hand; and with the eyes of faith, and of our minde, let us look upon the &s;ame Sonne of God, and inwardly behold him, who being urged with the great love of our &s;alvation, having fini&s;hed his la&s;t Supper in the Parlour of <HI>Sion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">[The &s;umme of Chri&s;ts Pa&s;&s;ion.]</NOTE> and being come into the Garden of Olivet, prayed and &s;wet blood, through the angui&s;h and grievous con&s;ideration of the immi|nent afflictions. Immediately he was betrayed by the mo&s;t wicked <HI>Judas;</HI> he was taken, bound, and thru&s;t
<PB REF="4">forward by the <HI>Jews,</HI> even as a Lamb by the Wolves, mo&s;t cruelly amid&s;t the noi&s;e of clamors and weapons, and then was lead to the hou&s;e of <HI>Anna</HI> the high Prie&s;t; There he was &s;tricken; from thence hee was drawn to the Pallace of <HI>Caiphas;</HI> in the &s;ame hee was fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, condemned, &s;pit upon, blindfolded, buffeted with fi&s;ts, and &s;undry wayes all the night &s;corned and afflicted. In the morning he was violently carried through the mid&s;t of the City to the hou&s;e of <HI>Pilate.</HI> From thence he was lead to the Pallace of <HI>Herod,</HI> and accu&s;ed again, de&s;pi&s;ed of him, mocked, and apparrelled like a fool in a white garment, and brought back again by another way of the City to <HI>Pilate.</HI> There again he was accu&s;ed of many faults, &s;tripped, and grievou&s;ly whipped, cloathed with purple, crowned with thorns, diver&s;ly derided, &s;pit upon, buf|feted with fi&s;ts, and &s;tricken with a reed, and be|ing thus mi&s;u&s;ed, was made a gazing &s;tock to the peo|ple, and adjudged to death. Then he was loaden with a heavy Cro&s;&s;e, and in the &s;ight of all the people, with grievous and bloody &s;teps he was drawn, punched, and urged by the furious violence of the &s;ouldiers, through a great part of the City, and by the gate of Judge|ment out of the City, by a hard and &s;tony way, even unto mount <HI>Calvary.</HI> And being come thither he was &s;tripped again, and being both faint and weary, was refre&s;hed with gall in&s;tead of drinke; and about high|noon he was fa&s;tened to the Cro&s;&s;e, and &s;o lifted up on high; and hanging on the cro&s;&s;e by the &s;pace of three hours, was derided with taunts and reproachful words; being thir&s;ty, they gave him vineger to drink. Finally, he which could &s;ave the world with one drop of his blood, would needs be&s;tow upon us by the five rivers
<PB REF="5">of his wounds, his life, with all his blood. A figure hereof was that Brazen-&s;erpent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 21.3. Ioh. 3.14.</NOTE> which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> cau&s;ed to be exalted in the wilderne&s;s. To this &s;pectacle al&s;o our heavenly Father calleth every faithful &s;oul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 3.11.</NOTE> <HI>Come forth</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>ye daughters of Sion, and &s;ee King Solo|mon;</HI> Nay one far greater then <HI>Solomon.</HI> In like manner Chri&s;t hanging on the Cro&s;&s;e cryeth out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lam. of Ier. 1.12</NOTE> <HI>O all ye which pa&s;&s;e by the way, behold, and &s;ee, if there be any &s;orrow and grief like mine.</HI></P>
<P>And not only to the con&s;ideration and meditation of the&s;e things, but al&s;o to the imitation, God in the holy Scripture exhorteth us in the&s;e words (&s;piritually in|terpreted) &s;aying, <HI>Look, and make all things according to the example or fa&s;hion which was &s;hewed thee in the Mount.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod 25.40. Heb. 8.5.</NOTE> For all the precepts of life, which our Saviour taught all the time of his preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The be&s;t book is Chir&s;ts pattern.</NOTE> as well by word, as by example, the &s;ame he expre&s;&s;ed in him&s;elf in one day of his pa&s;&s;ion; wherefore if we would follow Chri&s;t, not only in word, but al&s;o in work; we may, by his lively crucifying on mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> as it were out of a gol|den book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Latine, Greek, and Hebrew. Ioh. 19.20.</NOTE> intituled with the noble title of Three mo&s;t principal languages, written with the quils of the &s;pear, of the nails, of the thorns, and of the whips, in the mo&s;t pure parchment of the Immaculate Lamb, and with the purple blood of the &s;ame, both learned and unlearned, learn ea&s;ily and briefly perfect Theology, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome remedies of Phy&s;icke, the full knowledge of Law, and of Ju&s;tice, the &s;cience of li|beral Arts, of true humility, of obedience, of piety, of charity, of patience; finally of all manner of vertues, and of things mo&s;t perfect; and may al&s;o be inflamed and drawn to love and follow Chri&s;t. Thus the ble&s;|&s;ed Virgin, &s;tanding neer to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, did
<PB REF="5">not onely with bodily eyes, but al&s;o in heart, through faith (which wavered not in her) behold the wounds of her Son, and &s;eriou&s;ly thinking thereon, was &s;o comforted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambro&s;. in Luc. cap. <HI>23. Iohn 19.</HI></NOTE> that now (as <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> &s;aith) &s;he was pre|pared al&s;o to dye for the good of mankinde. So S. <HI>John</HI> both &s;eeing the &s;ide of Chri&s;t opened with a &s;pear, bloud with water coming forth of the &s;ame, and &s;o giving te&s;timony thereunto, did by the medi|tation thereof &s;o greatly profit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 23. <HI>Hier. Tom.</HI> 1. <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> 13. <HI>ad Paulinum.</HI> Mar. 15.</NOTE> that at the la&s;t he be|came a mo&s;t perfect divine, and a &s;oaring Eagle to be|hold the mo&s;t holy, <HI>and ble&s;&s;ed God the Father in the Son.</HI> So the Theef, when he &s;aw and heard Chri&s;t Je&s;us crucified, incontinently turned unto Chri&s;t, and con|fe&s;&s;ing him, he made the puni&s;hment of murder, Mar|tyrdome, and changed the Cro&s;s for Paradi&s;e. So al&s;o the <HI>Centurion</HI> by this &s;pectacle, received &s;o great &s;trength of faith, that under the Cro&s;s he was made a famous Confe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;t; and further (as <HI>Chry|&s;o&s;tome</HI> &s;aith) was afterward crowned with <HI>Martyrdome:</HI> Moreover <HI>Thomas</HI> beholding and touching the wounds of Chri&s;t crucified, was &s;o illuminated with faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chry&s;. in Mat. c. <HI>27.</HI></NOTE> that he plainly and openly profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 30.27.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> to be both his Lord, and his God.</P>
<P>This being &s;o, and love procuring love, even as the Load&s;tone draweth Iron; who is he, I pray you, whom &s;o vehement love of Chri&s;t, nay rather a heat and flame will not affect, kindle, and &s;et on fire? Who is he, when at the death of Chri&s;t all creatures doe &s;uffer with him, the Sun darkned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 27.45.5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> the vail of the Temple rent in &s;under, the earth quaking, Rockes break|ing, graves opening, and the dead ari&s;ing; Who, and what is hee (I &s;ay) that will not wonder, and that will not bee aba&s;hed? Onely <HI>Adams</HI>
<PB REF="6">children, for who&s;e cau&s;e he dyed, are not moved with this &s;o great a benefit.</P>
<P>The Adamant, that mo&s;t hard &s;tone, is mollified with the blood of a Goat; Iron with the heat of fire is made &s;oft;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 8.10.</NOTE> but the hearts of Chri&s;tians, more hard then Adamant or Iron, are not mollified with the blood and fire of Chri&s;t, but do crucifie a fre&s;h unto them&s;elves the Son of God, and do tread under their feet the bloud of the Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>What I pray you can be more be&s;eeming, more meet, more ju&s;t, and more profitable for us, then to love again him that &s;o loveth us; and imitate him whom we love? For if any thing herein &s;eem hard, if any thing grievous, that thing, love (the &s;weet yoke of the Lord) maketh light and ea&s;ie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 5.3.</NOTE> for all labour is light, to him that loveth, according to that notable &s;entence of that ancient <HI>Gregory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Epi&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>Nihil adeo grave e&s;t, quod non aequanimiter toleretur, &s;i Chri&s;ti pa&s;sio ad memo|riam reducatur.</HI> There is nothing &s;o heavy and burthen|&s;ome, but the &s;ame is willingly born, if &s;o be the Pa&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;t be remembred.</P>
<P>For we will indure all things with patience as light and ea&s;ie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.2, 3&punc;</NOTE> if we call to minde what hard words, harder &s;tripes, and mo&s;t hard pains and afflictions he &s;uffered for us, who&s;e head was crowned with thorns, his eyes blind-folded, his ears filled with reproaches, his mouth with gall and vineger, his face polluted with &s;pitting, his cheeks brui&s;ed with buffeting, his knees &s;haking, his &s;houlders laden with the Cro&s;s, his heart repleni&s;h|ed with &s;orrow, his body torn with whips, his mem|bers racked, his hands and feet bored; to be briefe, from the crown of the head, to the &s;oals of the foot, he &s;u&s;tained an innumerable &s;ort of wounds and &s;or|rows.
<PB REF="6">Wherefore as the waters of <HI>Mara,</HI> being &s;ome|times bitter, were made &s;weet by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15.25.</NOTE> at what time he ca&s;t wood into them; even &s;o all our tribulation, if we patiently indure the Cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t, will waxe &s;weet, and the gall thereof will turn into honey. For by the meditations of the&s;e afflictions of our Saviour, faith is illuminated, hope &s;trengthned, charity infla|med, and all vertue increa&s;ed. Wherefore holy <HI>Au|gu&s;tine,</HI> a light of the Church, no le&s;&s;e truly then godly, provoking us by very forceable words thereunto; &s;aith thus, <HI>Behold the wounds of him that hangeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t. in lib. de virginitate</NOTE> <HI>the blood of him that dyeth, the price of the redeemer, the &s;cars of him that ri&s;eth; His head boweth to ki&s;&s;e thee, his heart is opened to love thee, his armes &s;tretched abroad to imbrace thee, his whole body &s;et forth to redeem thee. Con&s;ider what, and how great the&s;e things be, weigh them in the ballance of your hearts, that hee may bee wholy fa&s;tened in your hearts, who for us was wholly fa&s;tened on the Cro&s;&s;e.</HI> Thus far <HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI> So that it is not enough to me|ditate of the&s;e things once, but it is profitable to thinke upon them often; yea the oftner, the more they avail and profit. In the whole&s;ome contemplation of who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion, although we profit much, yet we &s;hall never attain to the perfect knowledge thereof, but there will remain &s;till &s;omewhat that we may &s;eek for, the full knowledge whereof is re&s;erved to our hea|venly Country. In the mean time, let us contemplate in the&s;e things day and night; in the&s;e things let us recreate and bu&s;ie our &s;elves.
