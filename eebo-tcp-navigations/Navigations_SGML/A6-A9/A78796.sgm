<HEAD>His Maje&s;ties gracious A&s;&s;ent to the Peti|tion of the Earles of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Cumberland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe Earle of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Cumber|land</HI> petitioned to his Maje&s;ty both, to return to his Parliament (as was expre&s;&s;ely intimated in their Peti|tion) and humbly de&s;ired his Maje|&s;ty to a&s;&s;ent unto tho&s;e Propo&s;iti|ons which were &s;ent by the <HI>Parliament:</HI> who de|clare therein, That they had nothing in their de|&s;ires and thoughts more precious and of higher e&s;teeme (next to the honour and immediate Ser|vice of Almighty God) then the ju&s;t and faith|full performance of their duty to his Maje&s;ty, and their fidelity to the Kingdome? The&s;e &s;aid Earles were &s;ent for from York to attend the Hou&s;e the precedent Weeke; but they &s;hewed the Me&s;&s;enger of the Hou&s;e &s;peciall Warrants under his Maje&s;ties Hand, expre&s;&s;ely comman|ding them to the contrary, and that &s;hould at|tend his Maje&s;ty there, till his further plea&s;ure &s;hould be declared unto them.</P>
<P>But they being very &s;en&s;ible of the great in|conveniences
<PB N="2" REF="3">of this Kingdome, and what irreco|verable danger tho&s;e inconveniences may produce, if not prevented before they grow to maturity, after a deliberate ob&s;ervation of the cau&s;es there|of, did pre&s;ent their dutifull Petition to his Ma|je&s;ty in the po&s;ture as well of all &s;incerity as humility: That out of his Princely Wi&s;edome, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing his own Honours, and Safety, and gracious tenderne&s;&s;e of the welfare and &s;ecu|rity of his Subjects and Dominions, He would be plea&s;ed to returne to his <HI>Parliament,</HI> as being the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and principall mean (through Gods ble&s;&s;ing) of removing tho&s;e jealou&s;ies and differences, which have unhappily fallen betwixt him and his People, and as the effectuall way to procure both to his Maje&s;ty and to the <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> a con&s;tant cour&s;e of their Peace and Hap|pine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty tooke the Petition very graci|ou&s;ly, and de&s;ired &s;ome time of &s;erious con&s;ide|ration thereon, and then he would give them an effectuall An&s;wer. For all the di&s;tractions, and di&s;temper of this Kingdome are derived onely from his Maje&s;ties ab&s;ence, and if he would be &s;o conde&s;centious as to returne, que&s;tionle&s;&s;e the&s;e &s;u&s;pitions would be expelled, and better opinions entertained. And it is very requi&s;ite, That the great affaire of this Kingdome, may not be con|cluded or tran&s;acted by the advice of any pri|vate Man, or by any unknowne and un&s;worne Councellor: but that &s;uch matters as concerne the
<PB N="3" REF="3">State and the publike accommodation of the Realme, are proper for the high Court of <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> which is his Maje&s;ties great and &s;upreme Councell, ought to be debated, re&s;olved, and tran&s;acted onely in <HI>Parliament,</HI> and nor el&s;ewhere. And &s;uch as &s;hall pre&s;ume to doe any thing to the contrary, ought to be re&s;erved to the cen&s;ure and Judgement of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and &s;uch other matters of State as are proper for your Maje&s;ties Privie Councell ought al&s;o to be debated and concluded by &s;uch of the Nobility and other, as &s;hall from time to time be cho&s;en for that place, by approbation of both Hou&s;es of <HI>Parliament;</HI> and that no publike Act concerning the Affaires of the Kingdome, which are proper for your Pri|vie Councell may be e&s;teemed of any validity, as proceeding from the Royall Authority, un|le&s;&s;e it be done by the advice and con&s;ent of the Major part of the Councell, atte&s;ted under their Hands.</P>
<P>And without doubt His Maje&s;ty will conde|&s;cend to &s;o faire a propo&s;ition, for the <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> is his high and chiefe Court and Councell; wherefore it is very expedient, that the doubtfull matters of State &s;hould be de&s;cided, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and concluded by that high Senate.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty hath al&s;o &s;ealed with his Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and concluded, That the convention of Truce made between <HI>D. Michael de Loronha, Conde de Linhares,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Goa,</HI> and <HI>William Methuold</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Engli&s;h in <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4">&s;hall be continued and kept between the Subjects of both Kings in <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> and in all the Dominions of the mo&s;t renowned King of <HI>Portugall</HI> beyond <HI>Cape bona Speranza,</HI> and that the Commi&s;&s;ioners to be named by the &s;aid Kings, &s;hall in <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> take Cognizance with|in thirteen yeares of the demands, which have been or &s;hall be by the Subjects and Va&s;&s;als of both Kings for their commerce in <HI>India</HI> afore|&s;aid, that &s;o a perpetuall peace and confederation may be confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;aid Kings, and between their Subjects on both &s;ides. And becau&s;e the commerce of free comming of the Subjects of the King of great Britaine to the Coa&s;ts and parts of Affrica, the I&s;land of Saint <HI>Thome,</HI> and other I&s;lands comprehended under them, could not yet be agreed upon by rea&s;on of the defect of the powers &s;ent by the mo&s;t renow|ned King of <HI>Portugall</HI> to his Emba&s;&s;adors, that by this debate, this pre&s;ent Treati&s;e of Peace and Amity between both Kings and their Subjects be not delayed: it is on both parts concluded on, That in the Lands, Places, Ca&s;tles, Ports, and Coa&s;ts of <HI>Affrica, Guyne, Bine, &amp;c.</HI> the I&s;land of Saint <HI>Thome,</HI> and other I&s;lands comprehended un|der them, wherein it &s;hall appeare, That the Sub|jects of Great <HI>Brittaine</HI> have dwelt, for trade of Merchandi&s;e, or have had trade or commerce there, in the time of the King of <HI>Ca&s;teele,</HI> or hi|therto; there &s;hall be no alteration or change,
<PB N="5" REF="4">neither &s;hall they have any trouble or injury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">one them by the Portugals, for that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>And if any Cu&s;tomes be to be demanded from the Subject of the King of Great <HI>Britaine</HI> on any Cau&s;e in the Ca&s;tles, Places, and I&s;lands a|fore&s;aid, they &s;hall not be greater, or more grie|vous then tho&s;e which &s;hall be demanded from o|ther Nations in league with the King of <HI>Portu|gall.</HI> And the Subjects of the King of <HI>Portugall</HI> wanting forreign &s;hips for their Navigation, and Commerce to the Coa&s;ts and I&s;lands afore&s;aid may freely at their own plea&s;ure hire the Ship, of the Subjects of great <HI>Britain,</HI> and that Com|mi&s;&s;ioners and Amba&s;&s;adors &s;hall be named, by both Kings, who &s;hall create and conclude con|cerning the commerce, and free-comming to the Coa&s;ts, I&s;lands, and Places afore&s;aid, which hath been demanded by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the King of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> for the Subjects of their King, being per&s;waded out of the confidence of the antient amity which hath been between the Predece&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame Kings, that the mo&s;t re|nowned King of <HI>Portugall</HI> will grant to no Na|tion what&s;oever more ample Rights, Immunities and Priviledges, then he will grant to the Sub|jects of Great <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
