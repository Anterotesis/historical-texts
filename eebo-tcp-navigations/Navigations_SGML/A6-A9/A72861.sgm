<P N="1">1 THe fir&s;t Que&s;tion put by me, whether it be more pro|per to vertue and godlynes to giue or to lend, or to pay that a man oweth.</P>
<P><HI>Pierce Plowman</HI> an&s;wered, that of tho&s;e thr&eacute;e to giue was the be&s;t, to lend was the next, &amp; as for paying that which a man oweth: he held it a duty, &amp; in dooing of duty there &s;tan|deth no Godlynes, neither lieth there any thank therin, &amp; that (he &s;aid) app&eacute;ereth by <HI>Chri&s;te</HI> his owne woords who &s;ayeth, that when w&eacute;e haue doon that which was our duty: w&eacute;e are vnprofitable &s;eruants, neither hath paying, of debts any ex|pre&s;&s;e te&s;timony of Godlynes or vertue, in the Scriptures of God, or by common experience among men, wheras giuing hath a name of vertue, namely of liberallitie wherof the Pro+phet <HI>Dauid</HI> &s;peaketh thus. He hath di&s;per&s;ed and giuen vnto the poore, and his righteou&s;nes remaineth for euer. Again oof lending he &s;aith. The righteous is mercifull and lendeth, and will guide his woords with di&s;cre&s;ion. To be &s;hort, liberalitie (which extendeth both vnto giuing and al&s;o lending) is a pro|pertie of God, who both giueth and lendeth vnto vs his dayly gifts and ble&s;&s;ings, but borowe he ca~not neither pay his debt. And &s;o &s;hortly paying of debt in his opinion no vertue ne pro+pertie of Godlines, for that it is a thing which God him &s;elf cannot doo, and &s;o the fir&s;t twaine, vertues and the third no vertue, but a duty.</P>
<P>OVr Ho&s;te maintained the contrary, &amp; that to pay a mans debt is the mo&s;te excellent qualitie &amp; vertue of the thr&eacute;e,

And therfore full true it is y^e <HI>Ouid</HI> &s;aith, there is oftentimes a good fi&s;h in a wa|ter where a man would little think. W&eacute;e boa&s;t much of ciui|litie and nurture in the South partes of this land, namely in London, and di&s;prai&s;e and di&s;pi&s;e the North as rude and vn|ciuil, but &s;urely for mine owne parte (that am a Southern|man and borne in Kent) to &s;peak indifferently for any thing that euer I haue found in all my trauel in both the partes: I cannot &s;&eacute;e nor know why the Northern People &s;hould not rather pittie vs then enuie vs concerning either Godly|nes, Vertue or good maners, for h&eacute;er I haue &s;poken of the ba|&s;e&s;t kinde of People, wherby it may partly approoue what hope there is of the Gentlemen, merchants and them of the good Townes and Citties, for who&s;e &s;akes and generally for all others I vndertook to gather and to report this little Con|ference, and with Gods help and fauour haue doon it as n&eacute;er accordant to the trueth as I could, neither adding therto nor taking there from, the de&s;ire wherof cau&s;ed m&eacute;e to take the le&s;&s;er Iournies homewarde and to write it by parcells at my Innes lea&s;t I might haue forgotten it.</P>
<P>And h&eacute;erin I prote&s;t, that I haue neither flattered nor be|lyed any man, for my meaning is trueth and the commen|dation therof, and therin is no flattery, for &s;urelie if I haue flattered any body: it is mine owne &s;elf in y^t, that where be|fore I was per&s;waded that pride had vtterly corrupted this whole common welth and had clean ouer &s;pred it with his ge+neration of all vngodlynes and wickednes wherof all times and ages doo agr&eacute;e him to be the father: &s;ithence this Iourney I begin to hope y^t God wil haue mercy vpon vs, and hath and that h&eacute;e hath re&s;erued vnto him &s;elf a remnaunt as h&eacute;e did
