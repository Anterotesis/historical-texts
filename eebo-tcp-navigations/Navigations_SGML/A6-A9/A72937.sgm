<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Hamburg, the <HI>22.</HI> of October, <HI>Stilo veteri. 1630.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The King of Sweden hath already taken diuers good places in Meckelburg, and lyeth now neere Ro&s;tock, but the Imperiali&s;ts are very &s;trong within. The Forces of the &s;aid King, which he left at the &s;iege of Colberg, in Pomera|nia, &s;hew great courage, and are in hope to get the &s;aid Towne &s;hortly. There marched lately 8. &s;trong Compa|nies of Crabats, intending to relieue that place as they were commanded, but comming neere, before they were awares of it, they were &s;o welcommed by the Swedi&s;h, that the mo&s;t part was &s;laine, and the re&s;t forced to &s;aue them&s;elues by flight.</P>
<P>The Imperiall Forces doe much encrea&s;e about the Country of Magdenburg, whereby the Admini&s;trators his Troopes are no more at &s;uch liberty to run the Country as they were before.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y">
And cancerning the Duke <HI>Francis Charles</HI> of Low-Saxony (that was la&s;t winter here in London) hauing taken three or foure Townes of no great &s;trength, and inten|ding to take the Ca&s;tle at Ratzenburg from the Imperia|li&s;ts that lay in it, he was betrayed by his owne elder Bro|ther <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> that was in the &s;ame Towne, who letting in &s;ecretly at night &s;ome Imperiall Forces, cau&s;ed thereby all his Brothers men to be taken and vnarmed, and his brother the &s;aid Duke <HI>Francis Charles</HI> endeuouring to &s;aue him|&s;elfe by flight, went in a Boate vpon the Elb: But the Impe|riali&s;ts hauing planted &s;ome Ordnance to hinder the going away of any Boate, gaue fire, and &s;hot off the head of the Dukes Pilote, whereby the Duke was &s;taid, and (as we are informed) taken pri&s;oner, and &s;o carried vp in the Country towards the Emperour. The Imperialli&s;ts doe al&s;o daily encrea&s;e about Stoade, and in the Bi&s;hopricke Bremen, where they haue gathered all the Boates, to hinder any body to pa&s;&s;e, and them&s;elues haue pa&s;t ouer the Riuer of Elb about 4000. men, intending (as we are informed) to fortifie and keepe all the pa&s;&s;ages that are betwixt Lubeck and Hamburg, whereby there is threatned a great dearth in tho&s;e parts.</P>

<P>We learne from Spaine, that the &s;ame King hath cau&s;ed the Pre&s;ident of Mantua to vnder&s;tand, that hee mu&s;t depart thence, for there was no need of his pre&s;ence any longer.

<HEAD>From Millan the <HI>17.</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>It is verified from Con&s;tantinople that the Ie&s;uites haue a long time importuned the Grand Lord, to grant a &s;laugh|ter, and vtter extirpation of all the Greeke Chri&s;tians. The &s;ame was con&s;ented by him the &s;aid Great Turke, but there was no prefixed time pre&s;cribed for the execution of the &s;ame. Wherefore the&s;e bloodthir&s;ty wretches were at a certaine time and place a&s;&s;embled together, to re&s;olue when, and how this wicked enterprize &s;hould be put in practice. When they were &s;ate in Coun&s;ell in this nature; &s;uch terrible Thunder-claps, and dreadfull Lightnings fell from Heauen, that their mi&s;chieuous intention was there|by fru&s;trated. The Thunder and Lightning did ca&s;t them downe one after another to the very ground, did fire and burne the very Cu&s;hions whereon they &s;ate, &amp; put them all into no &s;mall perplexity, feare, and a&s;toni&s;hment. The Great Turke (who formerly had not willingly conde&s;cen|ded to the cruell and bloody de&s;&s;eine) did openly profe&s;&s;e, that he did palpably perceiue that &s;uch inhumane cruelty plotted again&s;t &s;uch innocent harmele&s;&s;e people, was alto|gether odious, abominable, &amp; di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty. Whereupon he con&s;ulted what ought to be done to the fir&s;t brochers and inuentors of &s;uch villany; and at la&s;t concluded and re&s;olued vpon, That &s;uch Mi&s;creants &s;hould be puni&s;hed with <HI>Lex talionis,</HI> that is, be &s;erued with the &s;ame &s;awce. It was &s;o effected: for all tho&s;e per&s;ons, that had a hand in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, as many as could be found out afterwards (being di&s;per&s;ed) were beheaded and put to death.</P>

Maiden, and de&s;ire to be re&s;olued therein: it is mo&s;t cer|taine and true. The fourth day &s;he lo&s;t her &s;peech againe. She then receiued the holy Sacrament, and wept mo&s;t bit|terly: afterward &s;he went from one roome and place to another, and did &s;hew with &s;ignes vpon her fingers, that &s;he &s;hould dye within 14. dayes. Which is verified from Wulffenbuttel to haue falne out according to her demon|&s;tration. She hath &s;poken mo&s;t &s;trange things, inditing and exhorting the people earne&s;tly to &s;erious repentance, to prayer, Chri&s;tian duties, generally to the &s;eruice and feare of God, for &s;he &s;aid that great mi&s;ery &s;hould befall tho&s;e parts: In&s;omuch, that betweene Augu&s;to and Galle, in the Country of Brun&s;wick, vpon the Long Wie&s;e, neere vnto Pethmar, &s;hould be &s;eene a terrible fight held, that men &s;hould goe vp to the very knees in blood. After this &s;hould come a great mortality, and at la&s;t a peaceable and pro&s;perous yeere. Which things, with many more &s;he &s;pake &s;o elegantly, pathetically, and with &s;uch grace, that each one thought &s;he was from her very Childhood brought vp vnto Eloquence; &s;he was of about the age, be|tweene 17. and 18. yeeres.</P>

<HEAD>Another from Regenburgh, concerning the re&s;olution of the Prince Elector of Saxony.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas his Imperiall Maie&s;ty, and the Princes of the Dyet haue &s;ent a &s;peedy Me&s;&s;enger againe to the Duke of Saxony, &s;ummoning him to appeare him&s;elfe in per&s;on, and &s;o to yeeld his verdict and opinion for the re&s;oluing what cour&s;e to take again&s;t the King of Sweden and other Ene|mies of the Empire, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing and furtherance of the publicke good:</P>
<P>This Me&s;&s;enger is returned backe with Letters to his Imperiall Maie&s;ty from the &s;aid Elector, and the Marquis of Brandenburgh, wherein they doe heauily complaine, that Germany within the&s;e 12. yeeres is &s;o &s;poyled and de&s;troyed, the Con&s;titutions of the Empire weakned, the Peeres impoueri&s;hed and abu&s;ed, the Liberties &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, that iu&s;t occa&s;ion and cau&s;e was offered to forraigne Prin|ces and Potentates to haue an in&s;ight in the affaires of the Empire.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding, the Peeres and Inhabitants haue very importunately de&s;ired his Maie&s;ty of Sweden to be&s;iege, and labour to incorporate both the pa&s;&s;ages of Gartz, and Griffenhagen: Their reque&s;t was thus earne&s;t in this be|halfe, to the end that the Country might be freed from the exce&s;&s;iue tyranny, burning, and pillaging&punc; &amp;c. The rea&s;on why his Maie&s;ty hath not yeelded to their de&s;ire as yet is,
<PB N="8" REF="6">
becau&s;e he hath another weighty Enterprize in hand, to the which end he hath arre&s;ted and &s;tayed many Ships, and laden the &s;ame with Men, Munition, Victuals, Ordnance, and all nece&s;&s;aries. With this Fleet and Army he &s;ailed very lately hence (the wind being fauourable) he pa&s;&s;ed by Wolga&s;t, and went to Straelzondt, where he will land his Army, and march to Mechlenburgh.</P>
<P>Before the departure of his Maie&s;ty, came Letters to him from the 6.

In the meane time his Maie&s;ty of Denmarke is Ma&s;ter of the Riuer Elue, he &s;uffers all manner of Ships and Barkes to pa&s;&s;e to and fro, but tho&s;e that a&s;cend the Riuer mu&s;t pay toll, as much as the Hollandi&s;h Conuoy doth amount vnto. His Maie&s;ty of Denmarke hath markt the Beacons with his owne marke, and &s;et them vpon the drought. He cau&s;eth great paines to be taken about the Blockhou&s;e which is rai&s;ed in the Hauen S. <HI>Margarita,</HI> betweene the Steur and Gheluck&s;tadt, where he will com|mand the Riuer Elue. As &s;oone as this worke is ended, his Maie&s;ties great Ships will againe goe downe to Cop|penhagen. The Magi&s;tracy of this Citty finding the char|ges exce&s;&s;iue and intolerable, haue ca&s;hierd mo&s;t of their Ships and Men; neither will the Commonalty yeeld any more Contribution. It &s;eemes that our (formerly &s;tout) Mariners haue now lo&s;t their courage; for a while &s;ince, 5. of our Ships fled from two of the Kings Ships, not da|ring to re&s;i&s;t them, or make &s;hot again&s;t them. This day came tydings that his Maie&s;ty is gone towards Rensburgh, to what end we doe not yet know. We vnder&s;tand that a Dyet is to be kept there, to con&s;ult concerning the affaires betweene his Maie&s;ty and this Citty. It &s;hould &s;eeme that the Duke of Hol&s;teyn is very diligent to further this place.</P>

<P>By rea&s;on the Dunkerkes are very &s;trong at Sea, being 27. of them in number, tho&s;e of Sealand haue &s;ent di|uers men of Warre again&s;t them.</P>

One Dunkerke among the re&s;t did a notable exploit, he met with one &s;ayling to Nantes with great &s;tore of <HI>Aqua vitae.</HI> This Dunkerker proffered to conuoy him thither, being (as he counterfeited) a States Man of War, he put forth a Flag of Rotterdam: hauing &s;ailed with him one whole day, he inuited the Shipper aboord the next day, and fea&s;ted him. This Ma&s;ter of the Ship pre&s;ented vnto the Dunkerke a Rundlet of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and while&s;t they were making merry together, the Dunkerke tooke him pri&s;oner, and cau&s;ed him to write to the Pilot for more <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> with the Boat which was full of men.
