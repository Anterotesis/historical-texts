<HEAD>A Speech delivered on the Scaffold in the Market place at <HI>Boulton</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> by JAMES Earl of DERBY, on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t, being the fifteenth of this in&s;tant <HI>October,</HI> 1651.</HEAD>
<P>_ON <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t being the fifteenth of this in&s;tant <HI>October,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Der|by</HI> was brought to the place of exe|cution, (the Scaffold being erected and &s;et up in the place where the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> formerly &s;tood) attended by divers Gentlemen and others; And where were pre&s;ent many hundreds of People, who came from &s;everall parts adiacent to behold this Object of compa&s;&s;ion. As &s;oon as his Lord|&s;hip came upon the Scaffold, he took up the Block, and ki&s;&s;ed it, &s;aying; I hope there is no more but this Block between Me and Heaven; and I hope I &s;hall never tire in my way, nor go out of it. Then turning to the People, and putting off his hat, he &s;pake as followeth:</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;tian Gentlemen, and People;</HI></P>
<P>YOur bu&s;ine&s;s hither to day, is to &s;ee a &s;ad Spectacle, a Peer of the Land to be in a moment unman'd, and cut off by an untimely-end: And though truly, if my general cour&s;e of life were but inquired into, I may mode&s;tly &s;ay, there is &s;uch a morall hone&s;ty upon it, as &s;ome may be &s;o pe|remptory as to expo&s;tulate why this great judgment is fall'n upon me: But know, that I am able to give them and my &s;elf an an&s;wer, and out of this brea&s;t (laying his hand upon his heart) to give a better accompt of
<PB N="2" REF="3"> my Judgment and Execution then my Judgers them&s;elves or you are able to give; It is Gods wrath upon me for &s;ins long unrepented, of many judg|ments with&s;tood and mercies flighted; therefore God hath whipped me by his &s;evere rod of correction, that he might not loo&s;e me; I pray joyn with me in prayer, that it may not be a fruitle&s;s rod, that when by this rod I have laid down my life, by this &s;taffe I may be comforted, and received into glory.</P>
<P>As for my accu&s;ers, I am &s;orry for them, they have committed <HI>Judas</HI> his crime; but I wi&s;h and pray for them <HI>Peters tears,</HI> that by <HI>Peters</HI> repentance they may e&s;cape <HI>Judas</HI> his puni&s;hment, and I wi&s;h other people &s;o happy, they may be taken up betimes, before they have drunk more blood of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> men, po&s;&s;ibly le&s;s de&s;erving then my &s;elf</P>
<P>It is true, there have been &s;everall addre&s;&s;es made for mercy, and I will put the ob&s;truction of it upon nothing more then upon my own &s;in, and &s;eeing God &s;ees it not fit (I having not glorified him in my life) I might do it in my death, which I am content to do. I profe&s;s in the face of God, no particular malice to any one of the State or Parliament, to do them a bodily injury I had none.</P>
<P>For the cau&s;e in which I had a great while waded, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, my engagement or continuance in it hath laid ho &s;cruple upon my Con&s;cience, it was on principles of Law, the knowledgment whereof I embrace, and on principalls of <HI>Religion,</HI> my <HI>judgment</HI> &s;atisfied, and <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> rectified, that I have pur&s;ued tho&s;e wayes for which I ble&s;s God I find no blackne&s;s upon my Con&s;cinnce, nor have I put it into the bead-roll of my &s;ins.</P>
<P>I will not pre&s;ume to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ide controver&s;ies; I de&s;ire God to honour him|&s;elf in pro&s;pering that &s;ide that hath right with it, and that you may enjoy peace and plenty, when I &s;hall enjoy peace and plenty, beyond all you po&s;|&s;e&s;s here: in my conver&s;ation in the world, I do not know where I have an enemy with cau&s;e, or that there is &s;uch a per&s;on to whom I have a regret; but it there be any whom I cannot recollect, under the notion of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> men I pardon them, as freely as if I had named them by name, I freely for|give them, being in free peace with all the world, as I de&s;ire God for Chri&s;ts &s;ake, to be at peace with me. For the bu&s;ines of death, it is a &s;ad &s;entence in it &s;elf, if men con&s;ult with fle&s;h and blood: But truly without boa&s;ting, I &s;ay it, or if I do boa&s;t, I boa&s;t in the Lord, I have not to this minute, had one con&s;ultaton with the fle&s;h about the blow of the <HI>Ax,</HI> or one thought of the <HI>Ax,</HI> more then as my Pa&s;&s;e-port to glory.</P>
<P>I take it for an honour, and I owe thankfullne&s;&s;e to tho&s;e under who&s;e power I am, that they have &s;ent me hither to a place however of puni&s;h|ment, yet of &s;ome honour to die a death, exceeding worthy of my blood, an&s;werable to my birth and qualification, and this courte&s;ie of theirs, hath much helped towards the pacification of my mind.</P>
<P>I &s;hall de&s;ire God that tho&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> in that &s;ad bedroll to be tried by the high Court of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> that they may find that really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> no|minall in the Act: An high Court of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> a Court of high <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> high in its righteou&s;ne&s;s, though not in its &s;everity, <HI>Father forgive them, and for|give me as I forgive them.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>I de&s;ire you that you would pray for me, and not give over praying till the hour of death, nor till the minute of death, for the hour is come alrea|dy, that as I have a very great load of &s;ins; &s;o I may have the wings of your prayers, to help tho&s;e Angels that are to convey my &s;oul to Heaven, hoping this day to &s;ee Chri&s;t in the pre&s;ence of the Father, and my &s;elf there to re|joyce with all other Saints and Angels for evermore.</P>
<P>One thing more I de&s;ire to be clear in. There lieth a common imputa|tion upon the Kings party, that they are Papi&s;ts, and under that name we are made odious to tho&s;e of the contrary opinion. I am not a Papi&s;t, but renounce the Pope with all his dependencies; when the di&s;tractions in Re|ligion fir&s;t &s;prang up, I might have been thought apt to to turn from this Church to the <HI>Roman,</HI> but was utterly un&s;atisfied in their Doctrine, in point of faith, and very much, as to their Di&s;&s;ipline. The Religion which I profe&s;s is that which pa&s;&s;eth under the name of <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> though that be rather a name of di&s;tinction, then properly e&s;&s;ential to Religion. But the Rellgion which was found out in the Reformation purged from all the errours of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 6. practi&s;ed in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles,</HI> that ble&s;&s;ed Prince decea&s;ed, that Re|ligion before it was defaced. I am of which I take to be Chri&s;ts Catholique, though not the Roman Catholique Religion: in the profe&s;&s;ion and practice whereof, I will live and die, that for my Religion. Then he turned him&s;elf unto the Executioner, I have no rea&s;on to quarrell with thee, thou art not the hand that throws the &s;tone, &mdash; <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> there is 3 l. for thee, <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Now tell me what I lack. <HI>Executi|oner. Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">air to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">urned up my Lord, Shew me how to fit my &s;elf upon the block. After which his doublet being of, and hair turned up, he turned again to the People, and prayed a good while. Before he laid down upon the block, he &s;pake again to the People, viz:</HI> There is not one face that looks upon me, though many faces, and perhaps different from me in opinion and practice, but (me thinks) hath &s;omething of pitty in it, and may that mercy which is in your hearts, fall into your own bo&s;omes when you have need of it; and may you never find &s;uch blocks of &s;in to &s;tand in the way of your mercy, as I have met with. I be&s;eech you joyn with me in prayer. Then he prayed (leaning on the Scaffold) with an audible voice for about a quar|ter of an hour; having done, he had &s;ome private conference with Dr <HI>Green,</HI> then taking his leave of his friends,&mdash;, and acquaintance, &s;aluting them all with a courteous valediction, he prepared him&s;elf for the block, kneeling down &s;aid, let me try the block, which he did, after ca&s;ting his eyes up, and fixing them very intentively upon Heaven, he &s;aid, when I &s;ay Lord Je&s;us receive me, Executioner do thine Office, then ki&s;&s;ing the Ax he laid down, and with as much undaunted, yet Chri&s;tian courage as po&s;&s;ibly could be in man, did he expo&s;e his threat to the fatall Ax, his life to the Executioner, and commended his &s;oul into the hands of God, as in|to the hands of a faithfull and mercifull Creator, through the meritorious pa&s;&s;ion of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">acious Redeemer, &s;aying the forementioned words; his head was &s;mitten off at one blow.</P>

<HEAD>The Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> his Funeral Sermon: Preached by Doctor <HI>Green,</HI> on Tue&s;day in the Afternoon before his Lord&s;hip was executed.</HEAD>
<P>Beloved, when we come to die, we &s;hall be &s;tript naked of three things,</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hall be &s;tript naked of all our worldly honour, riches and great|ne&s;&s;e. 2. We &s;hall be &s;tript naked of our bodies. And 3. Which is above all, we &s;hall be &s;tript naked of our &s;ins. And that is the happines of a child of God, he &s;hall put off, not only his mortal body, but the body of &s;in.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the fourth place ob&s;erve, As no man knoweth the time when he fals a&s;leep, a man fals a&s;leep before he is aware: So no man can tell the cer|tain time when he mu&s;t die. There is nothing &s;o certain as that we mu&s;t die, nothing &s;o uncertain as the time when we &s;hall die; Death comes &s;uddenly even as &s;leep comes upon a man before he is aware.</P>
<P N="4">4. When a man goeth to &s;leep, he goeth to &s;leep but for a certain time, in the morning he awakes out of &s;leep. So it is with the &s;leep of death; and therefore death is called a &s;leep, becau&s;e we mu&s;t all awake in the mor|ning of the re&s;urrection. We are in the grave, as in our beds and when the trumpet of God, and the voice of the Archangel &s;hall &s;ound, we &s;hall all ri&s;e out of our grave, as out of our beds. Death is but a &s;leep for a cer|tain time.</P>
<P N="5">5. Sleep is a great refre&s;hing to tho&s;e that are weary and &s;ick, and when the &s;ick man awakes, he is more lively and chearful then he was when he fell a&s;leep; and therefore &s;leep is called <HI>Medicus laborum, redinte gratio virium, recreator corporum,</HI> The great Phy&s;ician of the &s;ick body, the re|dinte-gration of mans &s;pirits, the reviver of the weary body. And &s;o it is with death, when Gods people awake out of the &s;leep of death, they &s;hall be made active for God, then ever they were before; when you lie down in the grave, you lie down with mortal bodies; <HI>It it &s;own a morta body, but it &s;hall ri&s;e up an immortal body, it is &s;own in di&s;honour, but it &s;hall ri&s;e up in ho|nour; it is &s;own a natural body, but it &s;hall ri&s;e up a &s;piritual body.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 When we ri&s;e out of our beds, we then put on our Cloathes So in the morning of the re&s;urrection, we &s;hall put on a a glorious body, like to the glorious body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we &s;hall put on <HI>Stolam immortalitatis,</HI> the garment of immortality.</P>
<P N="7">7 As no man when he layeth him down to &s;leep, knoweth the direct time when he &s;hall awake. So no man can tell when the re&s;urrection &s;hall be. They do but couzen you, who &s;ay, that the general re&s;urrection &s;hall be &s;uch or &s;uch a year; for, as no man can know the minute when he &s;hall awake out of his natural &s;leep, no more can any man know when we &s;hall ari&s;e from the &s;leep of death.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is a very ea&s;ie thing to awake a man out of &s;leep, it is but jog|ging of him and you will quickly awake him.</P>
<P N="9">9 As when a man ari&s;eth in the morning, though he hath &s;lept many hours; nay, &s;uppo&s;e he could &s;leep 20 years together, yet notwith&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="5" REF="4"> when he awakes, the&s;e 20 years will &s;eem to be but as one hour unto him. So it will be at the day of Judgment, all tho&s;e that are in their graves, when they awake, it will be <HI>tanquam &s;omnus unius horae,</HI> but as the &s;leep of an hour unto them.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially, As &s;leep &s;eizeth onely upon the body, and the outward &s;en&s;es, but doth not &s;eiz upon the &s;oul, the &s;oul of man is ma|ny times mo&s;t bu&s;ie, when the man is a&s;leep; And God hath heretofore revealed mo&s;t glorious things to his children in dreams, when they have bin a&s;leep; God appeared unto <HI>Abraham</HI> and many others in dreams, the body &s;leeps, but the &s;oul awakes. So it is with the &s;leep of death, the bo|dy that dies, but the &s;oul doth not die. There are &s;ome men that are not afraid to teach you, That the &s;oul &s;leeps as well as the body and that when the body dies and fals a&s;leep, the &s;oul likewi&s;e continues in a dull Lethorgy <HI>veterno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">mno correptus,</HI> neither capable of ioy nor &s;orrow, untill the re|&s;urrection. Beloved, This is a very uncomfortable, and a very fal&s;e Do|ctrine. They indeavour to prove it from my Text, they &s;ay, That <HI>Stephen</HI> when he died fell a&s;leep; It is true in regard of his body, he &s;ell a&s;leep, but his &s;oul did not fall a&s;leep, that which was &s;toned fell a&s;leep, which was his body onely; for when he was &s;toning, he &s;aw Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;tanding rea|dy to receive his &s;oul into heaven: Lord Je&s;us, &s;aith he, <HI>receive my Spirit Stephens</HI> &s;oul could not be &s;toned, though his body was &s;toned. So when I+e&s;us Chri&s;t was crucified, his &s;oul was not crucified. I mean, when his bo|dy was killed, his &s;oul was not killed: indeed he did endure torments in his &s;oul, which made him cry out, <HI>My God, my God why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> But yet his &s;oul did not die. So when Stephen died, his &s;oul went to Chri&s;t. It is true, when a child of God dies, the &s;oul goes to &s;leep; How is that? The &s;oul goes to &s;leep in a Scripture-&s;en&s;e, that is, it goes to re&s;t in Abrahams bo&s;om (O ble&s;&s;ed &s;leep) it goes to re&s;t in the imbraces of God, it goes into the arms of its Redeemer, it goes to the heavenly Para|di&s;e, it goes to be alwayes pre&s;ent with the Lord But take heed of that wicked opinion, to &s;ay, that the &s;oul &s;leeps in an Anabapti&s;tical &s;en&s;e; that is, That it lies in a &s;trange kind of Lethargy, neither dead, nor alive; nei|ther capable of ioy nor &s;orrow, untill the re&s;urrection. Though Stephens body fell a&s;leep, yet his &s;oul did not fall a&s;leep, but immediatly went un|to Je&s;us Chri&s;t in Heaven. Thus I have given the Explication of the words.</P>
<P>Now give me leave to make &s;ome Application of all unto our &s;elve.</P>
<P>If the death of Gods children be nothing el&s;e but a falling a&s;leep, then let this comfort us again&s;t the deaths of our godly friends though they die unnatural and violent deaths, though they be &s;toned to death, though they be burnt to a&s;bes, though they be &s;awn a&s;under, &amp;c Here is a me&s;&s;age of rich con&s;olation, which as a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t I hold out unto you this day, viz. That the death of a child of God, let it be after what manner &s;oveer it will, it is nothing el&s;e but a falling a&s;leep; he goes to his grave as to his bed; and therefore our burying places are called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">oimeteria, do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">mitoria,</HI> our &s;leeping-hou&s;es.
