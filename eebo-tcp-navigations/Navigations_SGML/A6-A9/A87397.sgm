<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VPon a late di&s;pute and engagement between the two Navyes at Sea, great was the re&s;olution and gallantry on both &s;ides; and for the &s;pace of ma|ny hours the Victory &s;eemed doubtfull; but in the heat of the Conflict, Divine providence proved a Banner to the Par|liaments party, and Fortune &s;o attended their &s;everall mo|tions in their heroick atchievements, that they &s;oon became Victors over their in&s;ulting Enemies, and in a &s;hort &s;pace
<PB N="2" REF="3">di&s;pier&s;ed that formidable Fleet, who for many moneths have lain raging upon the Neptune Seas, and forbed the two unfortunate Princes to take &s;anctuary in Harbours; &s;o that now the Citi&s;ens of <HI>London</HI> may receive comfort from the Ocean, and the Marchants and others proceed unanimou&s;ly in free Trade and Commerce without fear or mole&s;tation; The faciliating whereof, may cau&s;e thou&s;ands to rejoyce, and &s;ing hallelujah, for the vanqui&s;hing of this potent Ene|my; it being affirmed, that &s;ince our fir&s;t engagement with them we have re taken above 30 &s;hips and prizes, 200 pie|ces of Ordrance, and at lea&s;t 400 pri&s;oners. We hear that Prince <HI>Charles</HI> upon the 15 in&s;tant, with the Prince, and Prin|ce&s;&s;e royall about &s;ixe of the clock in the morning went to Dort, &s;o far the Queen of Bohemia, brought him on his way. The 11th of June the Electore&s;&s;e of Brandenburg, went toward Cleave, by Vionen, Rhenea The 17th of June, Prince Charles went from Breda toward Bruxels; where an Earl hath order to receive his highne&s;s. Therr is a Col. left in the <HI>Hague,</HI> who is to buy arms for ten thou&s;and men. There pa&s;&s;ing a boat from England to O&s;tend, with divers Engli&s;h they were &s;et upon by &s;ome Engli&s;h, who lie there and rove to get booty. The Pa&s;&s;engers were in great fear at which one of them &s;tood up, and &s;aid to the Pyrats, I have lately broke out of New gate, being a pri&s;oner for King <HI>Charles,</HI> and the&s;e are all my friends, therefore do them no harm? at which they cryed, <HI>Vive la Roy,</HI> and bid them pa&s;&s;e there &s;hould none of them be toucht.</P>
<P>They tell us that come from Edenburgh, that Scotland is quiet, and that the Parl. hath no enemy in arms, in any part of that Kingdom, which is &s;ufficiently confirmed by the &s;oul|diers beginning to be unruly and un&s;eparable concomitant to idlene&s;&s;e, which hath been complained of by the Parl, and Mini&s;ters, which occa&s;ioned the Gen.

Gen. that there might be a meeting of all the chief officers, for redre&s;&s;e or all grievances, and for ordering matters, &s;o that nothing might ob&s;truct the work in hand: the particular which fercht in this Gen, was that there were Engli&s;h Cavaliers &s;cattered up and downe in the army, &s;ome whereof had entertainment, others &s;helter which actions it were nece&s;&s;ary to remove, and retain only tho&s;e who of them were hone&s;t Covenanters. There is di&s;|plea&s;ure taken, that letters between Newca&s;tle and this place going for Scotland, were intercepted and opened, which is likely to procure the like, and is already threatned; di&s;plea|&s;ure is apt to catch: Dr. Sibbald the Phi&s;itian, is di&s;charged of his impri&s;onmen. upon the Fine of 500. Scotch marks, he &s;aith let them take what they wil, he wil not recant his pa|per, and will rather choo&s;e to &s;uffer the mo&s;t ignominious death at the opene&s;t plece in Edenburgh.</P>
<P>The Gent. that brought the letter from Parl. of England, of having neither countenance nor an&s;wer, nor is like to have if the deportment be evidence of re&s;pect to this nation, ther's little if an an&s;wer &s;hould be returned, as it's unlikely, or not like to be &s;odain, it wil be &s;ent in all probability by me&s;&s;en|gers of their own.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;. are at la&s;t returned from their declared King and landed at Kirkaldy: the pure Royali&s;ts &s;ay that there is no agreement brought (whether with joy or &s;orrow the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are made appear not the Sages and know|ing Divines &s;eem chearfull and expre&s;&s;e that Scotland hath cau&s;e to ble&s;&s;e God for the great condi&s;cention or &s;o much compliance in their King, and this &s;eems to be the more pro|bable; yer &s;ome begin to think it may now be in their power to act or &s;peak at lea&s;t in favor of their friends in England.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Louthian,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;io|ners are returned from the young King, with a me&s;|&s;age and an&s;wer to the Propo&s;als and De&s;ires of the Parliament; wherein he declares, <HI>That he is willing to give his Conde&s;cen&s;ions to tho&s;e things, which may &s;tand with his honour and &s;afety, and the liberty and freedom of his people, but doth wholly decline the taking of the Covenant, or to grant to what they last delivered in, &s;aying, That for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the Presbyterian Government, the granting of a generall Act of Oblivion, and the compo&s;ing of all differences what&s;oever vnhappily &s;own and &s;prun vp amongst his people, he will give his Royall a&s;&s;ent therevnto and therefore requires them to hear|ken to him, and not to proceed no further in contest, He being a&s;&s;ured, that he had friends enough among&s;t them, that would joyn with him, and endeavor the &s;acrificing of all that was neer and deer vnto them, for his ju&s;t re&s;titution, in re&s;toring of him to his Throne and Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>After which, his Highne&s;&s;e had a conference with the Lords of his privy Councel, wherein he further remon&s;tra|ted, <HI>That he conceived it requi&s;ite to decline &s;ending over any forces into Scotland, vntill &s;uch time that the re&s;ult of the Par|liament was known touching his la&s;t An&s;wer and Conde&s;cen&s;ions and not to hazard an engagement with the Parliament of Eng|land and the Army, vnder the conduct of the Lord General</HI> Fairfax <HI>and Lieut. Gen.</HI> Crumwell, <HI>till the next Spring</HI></P>
<P>At which Conference mo&s;t of the Nobility &s;eemed to re|&s;cent the &s;ame with great alacrity, declaring, That they did very well aprove of his Highne&s;&s;es motion, and that it would prove very prejudiciall to the advancement of his Cau&s;e, if they &s;hould engage before he be both powerfull and po|tent.</P>
<P>But indeed there is little probability of faciliating that
<PB N="4" REF="4">De&s;ign; for we hear that their di&s;playing of the Royal game at Sea hath quite broken the neck of their de&s;ign at land, &amp; that upon their lo&s;ing of &s;o many brave &s;hips and prizes, many hundreds a&s;hore have wholly de&s;erted, and in &s;tead of becoming ma&s;ters at Sea, and become the &s;laves thereof; in&s;omuch, that the coa&s;t is cleer, and commerce free for the Citi&s;ens of <HI>London,</HI> which otherwi&s;e might have been ob|&s;tructed.</P>

<P>Sir, Since the receipt of the la&s;t me&s;&s;age from the young King, to the Parliament, in an&s;wer to their former Propo|&s;als and De&s;ires, much time hath been &s;pent in debate there|of, and after &s;ome Re&s;ult thereupon, voted, That the &s;aid Conce&s;&s;ions are un&s;atisfactory, and (in paat) very de&s;truc|tive and prejudiciall to the peace of that Kingdome. The General Officers both of Hor&s;e and Foot, and the major part of the Souldiery, of the Scotti&s;h Army, have declared, That they will in no wayes comply with the Royal party, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, untill &s;uch time that he hath given full &s;atisfaction to all intere&s;ts what&s;oe|ver, in reference to the &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of their ju&s;t Rights and Liberties; and to that end are re&s;olved, to keep a faire corre&s;pondency with the Parliament and Army of England, for the prevention of future mi&s;ery, and &s;uppre&s;&s;i|ng of all in&s;urrections. Some of the Scots hor&s;e are ad|vanced towards the borders of England, for the inlargment of their quarters, and ea&s;ing the oppre&s;&s;ed of that Nation.</P>

The inclination of the Souldiery, being &s;o great as to be courted out of them, and perticlarly that of Donade not many miles from Dublin, is delixered up by Major Smith as the reporter &s;ayth.</P>
