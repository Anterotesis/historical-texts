<P>THE <HI>French</HI> thinking to do great Matters at Sea this Summer, got their Fleet out &s;omewhat &s;ooner than than they were wont, appearing more numerous and dar|ing than they did the la&s;t Summer; &s;o that on the 9th. of <HI>May,</HI> their whole Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of about 100 Sail, was, about Noon, &s;een off of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> at a great Di&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> three Leagues from the Start, and continued turning to the Ea&s;tward, the Wind at Ea&s;t and by North; and the next Day,
<PB N="3" REF="2">they were again &s;een from the &s;ame Place, when, by their &s;ail|ing, they &s;eemed as if they intended to &s;tand to their own Coa&s;t: And our Fleet being now well mann'd, and in a very good Readi|ne&s;s, on the 14th. of <HI>May,</HI> in the Afternoon, Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> weighed Anchor out of <HI>Rye Bay,</HI> and about eleven the next Morning joyned Sir <HI>Ralph Delaval,</HI> and Rear-Admiral <HI>Carter</HI> at St. <HI>Helens,</HI> and &s;oon after divers Dutch Men of War came to joyn him, &s;o that the whole Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of about Ninety Sail of Ships for the Line of Battel, the Officers and Seamen being very hearty and full of Courage, and every thing gave a happy Pre&s;age of the Glorious Succe&s;s that &s;oon after en&s;ued, as ap|pears by the Loyal Addre&s;s, humbly pre&s;ented to Her Maje&s;ty by the Chief Commanders of her Fleet; which for the Satisfacti|on of the Reader, it may not be ami&s;s to Incert, as an Intro|duction to &s;o glorious an Enterprize, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>This was &s;igned by Sir <HI>John A&s;hby,</HI> Admiral of the Blew, Sir <HI>Ralph Delaval,</HI> Vice Admiral of the Red, Mr. <HI>Rook,</HI> Vice Admiral of the Blew, Sir <HI>Clou&s;ly Shouel,</HI> Rear Admiral of the Red, Mr. <HI>Carter,</HI> Rear Admiral of the Blew; upon receiving which, her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>That &s;he had always this Opinion of the Commanders, but was glad this was come to &s;atisfie others.</HI></P>
<P>The Engli&s;h and Dutch Fleets having now taken the Seas, on the 18th. of <HI>May,</HI> the Admirals Scouts, whil&s;t he bore South We&s;t and by South, &s;even Leagues from <HI>Cape Barfleur,</HI> made the Signal for &s;eeing the Enemy, the Wind We&s;twardly: The French bore down upon our Fleet, and about eleven engaged it, but at &s;ome di&s;tance; we continued fighting till half an hour pa&s;t five in the Evening, at which time, the Enemy tow|ed away with all their Boats, and we after them. It was calm all day, about &s;ix there was a fre&s;h Engagement to the We&s;t|ward
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y">of the Admiral, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Blew, and it conti|nued calm all Night, but the Particulars at pre&s;ent, are only, that the French were beaten, and the Admiral was &s;teering a|way for <HI>Conquet Road,</HI> having a fre&s;h Gale Ea&s;terly (but very foggy) that being the place he &s;uppo&s;ed they de&s;igned for; and that if it plea&s;ed God to &s;end Fair Weather, he doubted not but to de&s;troy the whole French Fleet. In the Night, three or four Ships were &s;een to blow up, but not known what they were.</P>
<P>As to &s;ome other Particulars, it appears by another Advice, That about the grey or opening of the Morning, our Fleet made the <HI>French</HI> Fleet in a Line of Battel, about two Leagues to the Windward; and they then having the Weather-gage, bore down very boldly and clo&s;ely upon our Fleet; at Eleven the Engagement began, and continued very hot and furious till almo&s;t four in the Afternoon, at what time the <HI>French</HI> Fleet bore away. The Wind at We&s;t by South, and We&s;t South We&s;t, veering about to North by Ea&s;t, and North North Ea&s;t, Sir <HI>Clou&s;ly Shouel,</HI> and Sir <HI>John A&s;hby,</HI> having the Weather|gage, fell bravely on, maintaining the Engagement till almo&s;t ten at Night; the <HI>French</HI> all that while bearing away, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pur&s;uing them, &s;ome Ships were &s;een in the Night|time in flames, about nine of the Clock; but not knowing what they were, nor likewi&s;e the damage &s;u&s;tained on either &s;ide, when this Advice came away.</P>
<P>But &s;ince this, the <HI>Mary Galley</HI> came from Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> to <HI>Spithead;</HI> who left him at Eight in the morning, about fifteen Leagues South and by We&s;t from the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> declaring he &s;aw both the French Admirals Seconds &s;unk, and many Ships on fire, and that for the &s;pace of two Leagues together the Sea was full of Wrecks of Ships, but knew not of the lo&s;s of any of their Maje&s;ties Ships or Commanders; and that when this Galley came away, the <HI>French</HI> were running, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in pur&s;uit of them; and about Ten of the Clock he heard them Engag'd again, and the Guns firing till One, at what time the Wind &s;prung up at South and by We&s;t.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>Upon this News, and ever to be wi&s;h'd-for Succe&s;s, as well by Land as Sea, of which Heaven has given us already &s;o great an Earne&s;t of future Improvement again&s;t the Common Enemy, not only the Joy of all good Subjects abounded, but the Bells, in all places where it came, were rung out; the Tower-Guns, and tho&s;e in other places, were di&s;charged, and the Streets, at Night, filled with Bonfires and Illuminations, to the great con|tentment and rejoycing of the Nation.</P>
<P>Since the former Advices, a Letter came from <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> bearing date the 21&s;t. of <HI>May,</HI> giving an Account that Their Maje&s;ties Ship the <HI>Montague,</HI> Captain <HI>Foulk</HI> Commander, came in thither from the Fleet, his Ship being di&s;abled in the Fight, he leaving the Fleet the day before, about Nine of the Clock in the morning, pur&s;uing the Enemy; and &s;ays, that Mr. <HI>Carter,</HI> Reer-Admiral of the <HI>Blue,</HI> was kill'd in the Action. And the &s;ame Letter further relates, That Captain <HI>Killing&s;worth,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Fox Fire-&s;hip,</HI> had made his way to <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> in his Boat; and gave an Account, That he had burnt his Fire|&s;hip on board the <HI>French</HI> Reer-Admiral, but was put off with a great deal of difficulty; and that he &s;aw a <HI>French</HI> Man-of-War, of about Seventy Guns, blow up, and another Three-deck'd Ship on fire.</P>
<P>On the Twenty fir&s;t, about Nine of the Clock in the morn|ing, our Fleet &s;et &s;ail again; as likewi&s;e did the <HI>French:</HI> Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> took his cour&s;e towards <HI>Barfleur,</HI> having got &s;ight of divers Ships under the &s;hore: Admiral <HI>Allemond,</HI> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the Admiral of the <HI>Blue,</HI> &s;ailed to the We&s;t|ward. The fir&s;t of the&s;e endeavoured to get up with &s;ixteen of the Enemies Ships which he di&s;covered, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be coming from <HI>France</HI> to joyn the French Fleet. Sir <HI>John A&s;hby</HI> pur&s;ued the re&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, who in much Confu&s;ion laboured to get into the Rafe of <HI>Ornay.</HI> Admiral <HI>Allemond</HI> lo&s;t &s;ight of the afore-mentioned &s;ixteen Ships in the night, they having, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, got in among the Rocks; and becau&s;e he found it not &s;afe nor convenient to follow them there, he &s;ailed Ea&s;tward again, to rejoyn Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="4" MS="y">
<P>On the Twenty &s;econd, in the Morning, Vice-Admiral <HI>De|laval</HI> burnt, near to the &s;hore, under <HI>Cape de Wike,</HI> a great Ship, called the <HI>Royal Sun,</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> being the Ship of Count <HI>de Tour|ville,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, carrying a Hundred and Four Guns; as likewi&s;e the Admiral commanded by his <HI>Second,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Beaujeu,</HI> a Ship carrying a Hundred and two Guns; and the <HI>Fort</HI> of Eighty Guns; with two Frigats, and Three of le&s;&s;er rank: And Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was in clo&s;e pur&s;uit of Nine more. The Pri&s;oners who were taken from the burnt Ships, declared, That during the time of the Battel, 4 or 5 of their bigge&s;t Ships were de&s;troyed. Reer-Admiral <HI>Carter,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> after much Bravery and Re&s;olution, were both killed in the Fight: And at this time an Account came from <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> that four <HI>French</HI> Ships, of three Decks, lay on the back of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> extremely di&s;abled; and that two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War, who were refitted, with two <HI>Dutch</HI> Frigates, and a Fire-&s;hip, were going again&s;t them, to take or de&s;troy them.</P>
