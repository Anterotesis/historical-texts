<HEAD>A BRIEF DISCOURSE OF The mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured means and methods to ruine and pull down the va&s;t Monarchy of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Written by a judicious Per&s;on, who for above twenty years re&s;ided at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> being there employed by a great Prince as his Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Turki&s;h Empire</HI> is vulgarly called, the <HI>Empire</HI> of the <HI>Otto|mans,</HI> from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or <HI>Otho|man</HI> the fir&s;t Emperour of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ottoman</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of the Family now reigning, mo&s;t of who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ors did &s;everally en|large their Dominions, and
<PB N="2" REF="4"> by their Conque&s;ts added thereto, &s;ome of them entire <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> and the re&s;t, great and rich <HI>Provinces.</HI> Whereby they have made them&s;elves <HI>Sovereign Lords</HI> of part of <HI>Europe,</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and many great portions of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior's</HI> Empire borders upon the <HI>Republick of Venice</HI> towards <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> and that of <HI>Raguza,</HI> &s;ituate upon the &s;hoar of the <HI>Adriatick Sea.</HI> This latter <HI>Republick</HI> is their Tributary, and can pre&s;erve it &s;elf no longer than it &s;hall plea&s;e the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> for be&s;ides that the City is not &s;trong of it &s;elf, its &s;ituation is very di&s;advantageous, being built at the foot of a great <HI>Mountain,</HI> from who&s;e top they may by rolling down of huge &s;tones overwhelm them, and &s;oon become their ab&s;olute <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ters.</HI> Within a quarter of a league of <HI>Raguza,</HI> there is a <HI>Port,</HI> or <HI>Harbor,</HI> named <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> of a wonderfull capacity, wherein a numerous fleet may winter with much &s;afety.</P>
<P>If the prudence and policy of this <HI>Prince</HI> were as great as his power and &s;trength, he might long &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e have over|come this <HI>Republick,</HI> and have made u&s;e of the &s;aid <HI>Harbor</HI> for forty or fifty of his <HI>Gal|lies</HI> to lie always in a readine&s;s there, by
<PB N="3" REF="4"> which means &s;carce a Ship could go out or into the <HI>Adriatick Sea</HI> without being taken.</P>
<P>The whole Coa&s;t of <HI>Puglia</HI> might very ea&s;ily be ruined by the de&s;cents they might make, the di&s;tance from <HI>Raguza</HI> to <HI>Puglia</HI> being &s;o little, that one may ea&s;ily &s;ee from one &s;hoar to the other.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the <HI>Republick of Venice,</HI> though great by <HI>Sea,</HI> and who get mo&s;t of their riches by Trade and Navigation, mu&s;t &s;oon have declined, and could not but under the favour and protection of a pow|erfull Fleet have &s;ent any forces to de|fend &s;everal of their I&s;lands and places of importance; as <HI>Corfu, Zant</HI> and <HI>Cepha|lonia.</HI></P>
<P>They are Neighbours to <HI>Zara,</HI> a City lying in <HI>Dalmatia: Zara</HI> is on the <HI>Adri|atick Sea-coa&s;t</HI> very far up within the <HI>Gulf</HI> towards <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> near to <HI>Friuli</HI> and a Fort called <HI>Palma,</HI> which the <HI>Venetians</HI> erected &s;everal years &s;ince, to hinder their frequent incur&s;ions.</P>
<P>They are likewi&s;e Neighbours to the <HI>Arch-Duke</HI> of <HI>Grats,</HI> a <HI>Prince</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Bohe|mia.</HI> They are <HI>Sovereigns</HI> of the greate&s;t part of the Upper and Lower <HI>Hungary,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of many Cities not far from <HI>Vien|na,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5"> gained by force of Arms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Valachia, Bogdania</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> are their Tributaries, whom they change whenever they plea&s;e: <HI>Bog|dania</HI> joyns to <HI>Poland</HI> on one part.</P>
<P>If we take our &s;urvey along the coa&s;t of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> on the <HI>European</HI> &s;ide nigh <HI>Caffa,</HI> they confine upon the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Tartary.</HI> This Nation they make u&s;e of as the <HI>French</HI> Kings do of the <HI>Swi&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> which wa&s;hes <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> they border upon the Coun|try of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Maingrelia,</HI> and are al&s;o Neighbours to the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Georgia,</HI> both the one and the other are their Tri|butaries. <HI>Georgia</HI> lies near the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> with whom he confines; as likewi&s;e does the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> in many places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> are frequently in debate, and at war, as well by rea&s;on of their Vicinity which creates frequent occa&s;ions of quarrel, as out of the emula|tion and jealou&s;ie each <HI>Prince</HI> hath of his own grandeur; be&s;ides the contrariety in <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> calling the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> Hereticks, and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> e&s;teeming them &s;o too, and yet both of them hold <HI>Mahomet</HI> for a <HI>Prophet</HI> and the <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of God,</HI> not differing in their Belief, but
<PB N="5" REF="5"> in Ceremonies, and the wa&s;hings they are to ob&s;erve when they prepare them|&s;elves for their Devotions.</P>
<P>In <HI>Egypt</HI> along the <HI>Nile</HI> the <HI>Turk</HI> con|fines with <HI>Pre&s;ter-John,</HI> and is <HI>Lord</HI> al&s;o of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> of <HI>Meccha</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> places of their greate&s;t Devotions; <HI>Ma|homet</HI> being born at <HI>Meccha,</HI> and buried at <HI>Medina;</HI> the&s;e Cities are near the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> he likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great deal on the <HI>Mediterranean Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Along the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> he hath the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of <HI>Tripoly, Barbary, Tunis</HI> and <HI>Algier,</HI> and joyns upon the countries of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Marocco,</HI> who pay him homage and &s;ub&s;i&s;t in their dominions only be|cau&s;e they are of the &s;ame belief with him. I &s;hall not &s;peak here of the great number of <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> which are under his com|mand, nor of the innumerable <HI>Provinces</HI> he holds, my de&s;ign being only to repre|&s;ent in few words the grandeur of this <HI>Empire,</HI> and the ways to overthrow it.</P>
<P>If we &s;urvey what he holds in <HI>Europe,</HI> and al&s;o compute from <HI>Raguza</HI> or <HI>Bel|grade,</HI> a City upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> to <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> hardly can a hor&s;eman travelling ten or twelve leagues a day, ride from one end to the other in three months time, and in all that va&s;t extent of Land,
<PB N="6" REF="6"> there is no other <HI>Prince</HI> that hath any territory or command, he being the ab&s;o|lute <HI>Lord</HI> of all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ottoman Princes</HI> are wont &s;o &s;oon as they make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of any <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Province</HI> to ob&s;erve one me|thod, which is to &s;eize on all the <HI>Deme&s;ns</HI> of the <HI>Vanqui&s;h'd Prince,</HI> all that belongs to the <HI>Church,</HI> or to tho&s;e that die in battel, or tho&s;e who by flight make a &s;hift to e&s;cape the &s;torm.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e People who are content to remain in &s;ubjection to their <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> they leave to all &s;uch the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> and the exerci&s;e of their <HI>Religion,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hing according to the extent and riches or &s;trength of the Countrey &s;o conquered, either <HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> or <HI>Governors</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Provinces,</HI> together with <HI>Judges</HI> to admini&s;ter <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> The&s;e E&s;tates thus taken are &s;hared among&s;t a certain number of Souldiers &s;ufficient to guard and pre&s;erve their Conque&s;ts; they likewi&s;e be&s;tow fomewhat upon their <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks,</HI> but no more than is nece&s;|&s;ary for their feeding and cloathing.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the <HI>Grand Seig|nior</HI> hath three &s;orts of Trea&s;u|ries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t.</NOTE> The fir&s;t is managed by the <HI>Trea&s;urers</HI> of his <HI>Port,</HI> who
<PB N="7" REF="6"> are three in number, to whom all others within the Dominions of his <HI>Empire</HI> ought to give an account of their admini&s;trati|on; the expences of tho&s;e <HI>Provinces</HI> where they are employed being deducted, they &s;end the &s;urplus of the revenue to the &s;aid <HI>Trea&s;urers</HI> of the <HI>Port,</HI> who pay off the Souldiery every three months, as well as all other the expences of the <HI>Grand Seignior's</HI> hou&s;ehold, or whatever el&s;e belongs to the <HI>State</HI> or <HI>Go|vernmont;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second.</NOTE> the overplus (which makes another Trea&s;ury) is left under the keeping of an <HI>Eunuch</HI> whom they call <HI>A&s;enadar Ba&s;chy,</HI> and is one of the three principal <HI>Eunuchs</HI> who are near the per&s;on of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> and who never &s;tir out of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> or <HI>Palace,</HI> unle&s;s to attend and follow their <HI>Ma&s;ter.</HI> The &s;ums of Moneys which are put into the cu&s;tody of this <HI>Eunuch,</HI> re|main in Ca&s;h &s;till and are never employ|ed unle&s;s the mo&s;t urgent affairs require it, and then oftentimes the <HI>Trea&s;urers</HI> of the <HI>Port</HI> are fain to oblige them&s;elves to make it up again with moneys from a|broad.</P>
<P>The third Trea&s;ury, is that of the <HI>Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Third.</NOTE> which is very great for the following rea&s;ons:
<PB N="8" REF="7"> The <HI>Turki&s;h Empire,</HI> as I have &s;aid be|fore, is wonderfully large; the devotion of that people is great; it is true they have not among&s;t them either <HI>Bi&s;hopricks</HI> or <HI>Abbeys,</HI> they have onely very &s;ump|tuous <HI>Temples</HI> which &s;erve them for <HI>Pa|ri&s;hes.</HI> The <HI>Ottoman Emperors,</HI> their <HI>Pa|&s;haws,</HI> their principal <HI>Officers,</HI> and an in|finite number of other devout people, have founded and given much of their wealth to the&s;e <HI>Temples,</HI> (which we will from henceforward call <HI>Pari&s;hes</HI>) which are worth an hundred or &s;ix &s;core thou|&s;and Crowns yearly revenue; tho&s;e that &s;erve in them are few in number, and their allowance &s;o moderate, that they mu&s;t make hard &s;hift to live thereon, &s;o that there is much money remaining, which is put into the trea&s;ury of the <HI>Church,</HI> whereof the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> is the principal <HI>Guardian:</HI> yet cannot he make u&s;e of it, but when urgent occa&s;ions of State, and the maintenance of their Faith makes it nece&s;&s;ary, unle&s;s he will offend his Con&s;cience, and violate the Laws of the <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
<P>The Revenues of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> are very va&s;t, ari&s;ing as well from the or|dinary duties paid by the common people, as tho&s;e contingent &s;ums that are brought
<PB N="9" REF="7"> into his <HI>Coffers:</HI> he is heir to all his Soul|diers and to every one that receives pay from him, if they die without Children; but if they leave Daughters he takes but two thirds of the inheritance and &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of the decea&s;ed, holding the place of Son.</P>
<P>As there comes frequent complaints again&s;t &s;uch as are in eminent Offices and employments of tru&s;t, that they may have pretence to fleece them and get their E&s;tates, they &s;oon conclude them guilty, and &s;eize upon all they have to apply it to the u&s;e and benefit of the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> This inju&s;tice and cruelty is of dangerous con&s;equence; as is that likewi&s;e of appropriating the revenues of their <HI>Temples</HI> to their own private advantage.</P>
<P>To re&s;ume what I was &s;aying of the methods they pur&s;ue when they have conquer'd any <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Province;</HI> after they have given to their <HI>Temples,</HI> and to tho&s;e that &s;erve in them what they think to be nece&s;&s;ary, and al&s;o to &s;uch numbers of Souldiers de&s;igned for the guard of their new Conque&s;ts, they apply one part of it to the maintenance of the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> or <HI>Governor:</HI> they do the &s;ame for <HI>Sala|ries</HI> to the <HI>Judges,</HI> and other <HI>Officers,</HI> all which is di&s;tributed by the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="8"> the <HI>Province,</HI> who is accountable for the &s;ame, and who ought every three months to bring the remainder into the <HI>Grand Seignior's Coffers,</HI> upon pein of corporal puni&s;hment and confi&s;cation of his Goods.</P>
<P>Speaking of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Thunis,</HI> I had forgot to mention with what facility the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> might infe&s;t, yea ruine the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> and by the fre|quent crui&s;ings of his <HI>Galleys</HI> mole&s;t the coa&s;ts of <HI>Calabria,</HI> &s;ince hard by <HI>Thunis</HI> there is a <HI>Gulf</HI> which beats at the feet of the ruines of <HI>Goletta</HI> and the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Car|thage,</HI> able at all &s;ea&s;ons to contain a na|val force: Near the &s;aid <HI>Gulf</HI> there is a very &s;afe and a very capacious <HI>Harbor,</HI> named <HI>Porto Farino,</HI> di&s;tant from the &s;aid <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Sicilia</HI> not above four&s;core miles, and therefore may be &s;ailed over in a very &s;hort time. Should the <HI>Turk,</HI> powerfull as he is, keep always a good number of <HI>Galleys</HI> in readine&s;s in the afore|&s;aid <HI>Gulf</HI> of <HI>Thunis,</HI> or the above-named <HI>Porto Farino,</HI> they might &s;oon be upon the <HI>Sicilian</HI> &s;hoar, keep them in perpetu|al alarms, which would ruine the trade of all &s;uch as &s;ail upon the coa&s;t; hinder the <HI>Sardinians</HI> in their traffick, whil&s;t the <HI>I&s;lands</HI> of <HI>Malta, Cor&s;ica, Majorca,</HI> and <HI>Minorca,</HI> would be liable to the &s;ame trou|ble and inconveniencies.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="8">
<P>But the ambition of the <HI>Ottoman Prin|ces,</HI> and the inveterate hatred they bear again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> having cut them out &s;o much work on that &s;ide, they have neglected the opportunities they had to doe the&s;e and other mi&s;chiefs to the <HI>Eu|ropean Princes;</HI> be&s;ides that their <HI>Religion</HI> obliges them to believe that there is more merit in killing one <HI>Per&s;ian Heretick</HI> in war, than if they &s;lew three&s;core and ten <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;o that their great zeal and rage carries them more that way. And this is that which hath in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ecured the <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> which ne|verthele&s;s hath but too many times felt the weight and force of this too potent <HI>Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1593. the Treaties of <HI>Peace</HI> made between the <HI>Emperour Rodulphus</HI> and the <HI>Grand Seignior Amurath,</HI> about the intere&s;t of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> (wherein both of them had &s;hares) were broken, and they fell out, and that Agree|ment was converted into a dangerous and bloody war; the event proved pre|judicial to <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and &s;hamefull to the &s;aid <HI>Emperour,</HI> by the &s;ignal lo&s;s of a <HI>Battel,</HI> the <HI>City, Ca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Agria;</HI> it was terrible and bloody for the va&s;t numbers of Chri&s;tians &s;lain upon the
<PB N="12" REF="9"> place, or taken and carried away captive by the common enemies of our Faith: It was in <HI>Anno</HI> 1596 that this di&s;a&s;ter hapned.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve that this War com|menced during the reign of <HI>Amurath,</HI> and ended in the reign of <HI>Mahomet</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> who had the reputation and honour of being at the head of his Army when this Victory was gained; but he did not make u&s;e of all that advantage which for|tune had put into his hands; for in&s;tead of wintering and putting part of his Army into the Cities under his command, which are numerous on that frontier, he retur|ned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and lo&s;t the oppor|tunity of making him&s;elf a&s;&s;uredly <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and of all <HI>Hungary;</HI> which gave the <HI>Emperour</HI> lei&s;ure and means to prevent his utter ruine.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e times the intere&s;t of the <HI>Po|landers</HI> made them begin to be&s;tir them&s;elves, and they were making ready to joyn their forces with the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s, fore&s;eeing and apprehending that after the lo&s;s and ruine of <HI>Hungary,</HI> they mu&s;t needs fall too; yet, notwith&s;tanding this their fears of the power of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Tartary</HI> their neighbour, and &s;ome other ob|&s;tacles mentioned el&s;ewhere then ob&s;truct|ed their de&s;ign.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="9">
<P>Before I propo&s;e the certain means whereby the <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes</HI> may ruine this great <HI>Monarchy,</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak &s;ome|what of its dreadfull force and &s;trength, that &s;o &s;uch as &s;hall take the pains to reade this brief Di&s;cour&s;e may know, what great power they have, and what forces they can bring together to trouble and mole&s;t <HI>Europe,</HI> and by con&s;equence what care ought to be taken to hinder the di&s;mal effects. Now we ought not to let them know their own advantages any longer, but prevent and attaque them betimes, which cannot be without a <HI>Ge|neral union of the Christian forces:</HI> but be|fore I di&s;cover the methods they ought to take, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, (as I &s;aid above) to repre&s;ent what the power of the <HI>Turk</HI> is, as well by <HI>Sea</HI> as by <HI>Land,</HI> that it may be apparent they are not ea&s;ie to be beaten, or overcome, but by the way pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This <HI>Empire</HI> hath under its command five and forty <HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> as well in <HI>Europe,</HI> as <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> the names and titles of them in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> tongue are not un|der&s;tood by the <HI>European Chri&s;tians,</HI> (un|le&s;s by &s;uch as live under their &s;ubjection) which is the rea&s;on why I &s;hall not par|ticularly nominate them, but refer my
<PB N="14" REF="10"> &s;elf to the capitulations between our <HI>Kings</HI> and the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> (which were not long &s;ince tran&s;lated and ampli|fied) under the reigns of <HI>Amurath, Ma|homet,</HI> &amp;c. who had &s;o much vanity, that in order to make known their grandeur and power they cau&s;ed them all to be named and in&s;erted in tho&s;e agreements.</P>
<P>There are in this number of five and forty <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> two of them that have each his five and twenty <HI>Provinces</HI> under his command, and in every <HI>Province</HI> they have a <HI>Governour</HI> whom they entitle <HI>San|jacbey,</HI> as much as to &s;ay <HI>Lord of the Stan|dard,</HI> or <HI>Banner,</HI> nay &s;ome of them, whom I &s;hall only name, as the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> hath &s;even and twenty <HI>Provin|ces;</HI> the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI> eighteen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Natolia</HI> &s;eventeen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Arzeron</HI> &s;eventeen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> twenty four, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;eras</HI> twenty one, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Diar|bekir</HI> nineteen, the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> more than the above named; but not to be too tedious, I &s;hall omit to mention the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Forces of all the&s;e <HI>Provinces</HI> as well of Foot as Hor&s;emen, without in|cluding tho&s;e that ought to &s;erve at Sea, are very formidable: the number of
<PB N="15" REF="10"> them is above eight hundred thou&s;and men, 'tis true they are not &s;o brave and generous as they have formerly been, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Venality</HI> that hath crept in among&s;t them.</P>

<P>As for the Souldiers they put on board their Galleys, there are &s;ome that have <HI>Commandries</HI> along the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Shore, chiefly towards the <HI>Morea;</HI> who &s;end out one <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> one <HI>Lieutenant</HI> and other Officers, with fifty, three-&s;core, or an hundred <HI>Jani|zaries</HI> for each <HI>Galley,</HI> according to the undertaking they have in hand: the <HI>Ma|riners</HI> are named <HI>Azabi&s;tan;</HI> they are well furni&s;hed with Cannon and want not for Ammunitions, but generally their Gun|ners are unskilfull; and indeed that Art is very difficult, unle&s;s they have been u&s;ed to Navigation, there being a great deal of skill in pointing of Guns upon the Sea, becau&s;e of the motion of the Ve&s;&s;els and Galleys, which are ever in agitation more or le&s;s. As for their Pro|vi&s;ions they have them in great quanti|ties, their Countries abounding much in Wheat, Rice, Fle&s;h, Butter, Oil, Chee&s;e, and other provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for Navi|gation: they can endure a great deal, and that without any trouble, for from their infancy are they accu&s;tomed to live &s;oberly. Their Galleys are not pe|&s;tered nor encumbred like ours: for fir&s;t they have not the u&s;e of Wine, they carry no great &s;tore of Salt-meats, as we
<PB N="31" REF="18"> do, be&s;ides many other things; wherefore their Galleys are much lighter than ours, cleaner, and the Rowers put to le&s;s labour and pains in their work, by rea&s;on the very Souldiers take a plea&s;ure in helping of them; thus are they more fit and nim|ble either to follow or to fly away from an enemy if they be over-matched.</P>
<P>In the Harbor or Port of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> a great number of Galleys are ordi|narily to be &s;een riding in the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> as we &s;ee our Hor&s;es tyed in rows within our Stables.

<P>As for round Ve&s;&s;els, or as we call them, tall Ships, they have but few fit to make men of war: they have only five or &s;ix great Gallions which &s;erve to carry Wood into <HI>Egypt</HI> proper for build|ing, which they fetch from the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and from <HI>Egypt</HI> they bring back provi&s;ions to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as well for the u&s;e of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Kitchin as for the inhabitants: <HI>viz.</HI> great quantities of <HI>Rice, Sugars, Spices</HI> and other Victuals and Merchandize: of the&s;e <HI>Gallions</HI> they make &s;ome u&s;e in ca&s;e of need.

<PB N="32" REF="19"> fifty &s;ail of <HI>Merchant</HI> Ships, which being well fitted may &s;erve as a Convoy to the re&s;t of the Fleet. They can likewi&s;e equip five or &s;ix <HI>Mahones</HI> (which are a &s;ort of <HI>Galea&s;&s;es</HI>) but they have but few men fit to manage them; they have &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tian Subjects</HI> whom they keep in the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Rhodes</HI> in a great Town na|med <HI>Lindo,</HI> who have large and good Ve&s;&s;els, they can bring about twenty of the&s;e into &s;ervice: and this is all the &s;trength they can make at Sea, which is not very con&s;iderable, if the power of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> would joyn together to at|tack them: And indeed, it is by Sea, that they may with mo&s;t ea&s;e and cer|tainty be de&s;troyed, and not by Land, where they march with millions of men into the field: it being mo&s;t true, that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> can make up two or three Armies, that &s;hall each con&s;i&s;t of at lea&s;t two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and men, as well foot as hor&s;e, but much &s;tronger in hor&s;e than foot. Did they under&s;tand the art of War &s;o well as we do, they would be invincible, &s;ince they have &s;o much &s;trength and courage. They carry along with their Armies a great number of &s;mall bra&s;s Field-pieces, which require not above
<PB N="33" REF="19"> two hor&s;es to draw each of them; of the&s;e they have many, and &s;o &s;oon as they encamp they chain them to one another, and make a large ring, wherein they place a part of their Infantry, and there &s;ecure the Tents of their Chiefs.</P>
<P>That which makes them &s;o valiant is their opinion and belief of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> and their holding that all tho&s;e that die in battel for the defence of their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Countrey</HI> die <HI>Martyrs</HI> and go into <HI>Pa|radi&s;e,</HI> without any obligation of giving farther account or &s;atisfaction for their former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: on the contrary, &s;uch as die with their backs towards the enemy, flying from the &s;hock, are all damned, and if they do e&s;cape the dan|ger they lo&s;e their honour and the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s pay, and oftentimes their <HI>Com|manders</HI> put them to death, at lea&s;t their goods and e&s;tates are &s;ure to be confi&s;cate. They are ill armed, the foot who are quite naked carrying only a &s;mall Mu&s;|quet, and a very &s;hort Sword, which the greater part &s;eldom know how to u&s;e, &s;o that although they are very nu|merous, if they be roundly charged, they are ea&s;ily overcome, whatever re&s;i&s;tance they &s;trive to make. Their Cavalry are better, being advantageou&s;ly mounted
<PB N="34" REF="20"> upon very good hor&s;es; they go on to fight with much heat and fury, but will not &s;tand any long engagement, unle&s;s they gain &s;ome apparent advantage; and if they make a retreat, it is by turning now and then back, and making a &s;light charge at every facing upon the enemy, which is their way.</P>
<P>And although I have in this Di&s;cour&s;e made known the power of this great Ad|ver&s;ary, yet I dare warrant, would <HI>God</HI> permit an <HI>union</HI> of the forces belonging to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates,</HI> that they would be more than &s;ufficient to de&s;troy them in a few years. But, as I have already hinted, they mu&s;t fir&s;t be attacked by Sea, and the Land forces ought by all means to avoid giving battel till they have the news of a naval victory, which will be inevitable, if <HI>God</HI> for our &s;ins &s;hould not hinder and ob&s;truct the effect of our joynt endeavours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Catholick King</HI> might arm an hun|dred <HI>Galleys,</HI> as well &s;uch as he keeps upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> as tho&s;e of the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicilia,</HI> compre|hending that Squadron he maintains at <HI>Genoa.</HI></P>

<P>Let us then &s;peak of the War that is now in <HI>Hungary:</HI> And fora&s;much as a di&s;cour&s;e you made to me about three years &s;ince, brought us within &s;ight of a black cloud that was gathering in <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania,</HI> and which hath &s;ince produced &s;uch a tempe&s;t, as hath born down <HI>George Ragotsky</HI> and <HI>Jona Kemin,</HI> to rai&s;e <HI>Abafti</HI> to the Throne: entertain me with the cau&s;e and &s;equel of that change, that I may the better know whence it happened that the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> who had been only an idle Spectator in the Tragedy, (which <HI>Europe</HI> was acting for thirty years together) &s;hould now attack his Neigh|bours without provocation, and give us occa&s;ion to take up Arms, while we are in a capacity to unite in &s;uch a manner as may give him cau&s;e to repent his under|taking. I am confident that this rupture was preceded, accompanied and followed with &s;o many notable circum&s;tances, that I might to good u&s;e and purpo&s;e, &s;pend many days in canva&s;ing and weighing them; and &s;uch as &s;hall con&s;ider them duly afterwards may reap both plea&s;ure and profit by it.</P>

<P>Although your will hath ever been a law to me, yet is it not without &s;ome kind of regret that I now undertake to

And that you may have the more rea&s;on to acquie&s;ce in what I &s;hall tell you, I will take my ri&s;e from the very fir&s;t &s;ource, and repre&s;ent in Epitome, all what the <HI>Turks</HI> have done in <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;ince the time that <HI>Bajazet</HI> came thither to &s;upport their rebellion, and foment their di&s;cord. I know the ignorant will &s;ay, that the <HI>Turk</HI> hath little or no regard to ju&s;tice when he undertakes a War; and that the advantage he thinks to meet with in his enterprizes is ever the principal motive of his de&s;igns. For my own part, I own there is little faith to be hoped for or expected from an Infidel, and that many times the <HI>Turk</HI> hath no other aim in his attempts but his own in|tere&s;t: But withall it is not impo&s;&s;ible for him to cloak tho&s;e de&s;igns his ambition prompts him to act in the world, with &s;ome fair and &s;pecious pretence.

<P>You ask and de&s;ire two things to|gether, which &s;eem incompatible; how|ever, I &s;hall endeavour to joyn them in one, and de&s;pair not to perform the task, provided you will be very attentive. In the year 1350, or, according to others, 1383, <HI>Lewis</HI> the fir&s;t of that name reigned peaceably over the people of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania, Moldavia, Valachia, My&s;ia, Dalmatia</HI> and <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> which were of the appurte|nances of his Kingdom: but his quiet was di&s;turbed by a misfortune as little dreamt on as fore&s;een. <HI>Jane</HI> Queen of <HI>Naples,</HI> a mo&s;t di&s;&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> preferring &s;ome young <HI>Neapolitans</HI> before King <HI>Andrew</HI> her Husband, &s;he cruelly put him to death. The news whereof, and the Let|ters from &s;uch as were &s;truck with hor|rour at this <HI>Paricide,</HI> did ea&s;ily prompt the Soul of <HI>Lewis</HI> to a ju&s;t revenge. This generous <HI>Prince,</HI> believing that both ho|nour and ju&s;tice obliged him to take up Arms to revenge the death of his Brother, rai&s;ed a great Army, and went to <HI>Naples</HI> to bring the guilty to condign puni&s;hment. His expedition was pro&s;perous, and ha|ving put <HI>Jane</HI> to flight, and routed
<PB N="58" REF="32"> her Confederates, he brought the Rebels to rea&s;on, and puni&s;hed the chief abet|tors of that dete&s;table <HI>Paricide.</HI> Which being done, and all things appea&s;ed, he thought his own ancient <HI>Kingdom</HI> might require his pre&s;ence, and therefore was contriving to return again, not neglecting at the &s;ame time any means to pre&s;erve his new one.

<P>The <HI>Tran&s;ilvanian</HI> as able a <HI>Courtier,</HI> as a <HI>Captain,</HI> concealed his re&s;entment, while he thought it would be u&s;ele&s;s to di&s;cover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and <HI>Lewis</HI> being dead, he then believed that Fortune pre&s;ented a favourable opportunity for his revenge.

By this agreement <HI>John</HI> was to enjoy the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> till his death; and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> or one of his <HI>Sons</HI> was to &s;ucceed him.

<P>In this affair, <HI>King John</HI> was like unto him that holds a <HI>Wolf</HI> by the <HI>Ears:</HI> He found there was as much cau&s;e of fear on the behalf of <HI>Solyman,</HI> as from his competitor to the <HI>Kingdom;</HI> and he thought he might have better hopes in a <HI>Chri&s;tian Prince,</HI> than from an Infidel. Yet &s;o it fell out, that in the end, his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors &s;ubmitted to the <HI>Turk,</HI> to pre&s;erve part of their Dignity: as we are going to &s;ee. Some while after the Marriage of <HI>King John, Stephen Maillats,</HI> and &s;ome others, took up Arms again&s;t him, in be|half of <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> Then <HI>John</HI> willing to extingui&s;h the Fire, before it grew to a greater head, left the <HI>Queen</HI> at <HI>Buda,</HI> and went into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania;</HI> where he freely pardon'd tho&s;e that confe&s;&s;ed and were &s;orry for their faults; which <HI>Clemency</HI> cau|&s;ed many to return to their Duty.

His death was concealed, as much as it was po&s;&s;ible; but at length it was made pub|lick with the tenor of his <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Te&s;ta|ment.</HI> By it, the <HI>King</HI> declared his Son the univer&s;al Heir of all his E&s;tate: and <HI>George Martini&s;ius Tutor</HI> to the &s;aid <HI>Prince.</HI> Some days before he died, the <HI>King</HI> had exhorted the <HI>Hungarian Nobility</HI> to have a regard to the honour of the <HI>Nation,</HI> and to prefer his Son before any other when they came to elect a <HI>King:</HI> a&s;&s;uring them that the <HI>Turk</HI> would take care to protect him, if they had recour&s;e to his Arms.

<P>I am fair and &s;oftly drawing on to|wards what you de&s;ire to know. The <HI>Valachians</HI> and <HI>Moldavians</HI> admiring the <HI>Victories</HI> of the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians,</HI> would needs have their &s;hare, and therefore joyned with them. <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> finding his lo&s;&s;es cau&s;ed this revolt, de&s;i|red to prevent the like; and to that pur|po&s;e, commanded the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of <HI>Themi&s;var,</HI> to attack tho&s;e Rebels, and to make them feel the &s;everity of fire and &s;word. The <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> willing to obey this order, went into the field: but was defeated about the latter end of the year 1564. This <HI>Victory</HI> of <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI>'s, was &s;oon follow'd by another over above twenty thou&s;and <HI>Tartars,</HI> who returning homewards, laden with booty, were &s;et upon, and defea|ted by the &s;aid <HI>Sigi&s;mund:</HI> About the &s;ame time died <HI>Amurath</HI> II. and had for Succe&s;&s;our <HI>Mahomet</HI> the third his Son, who was then aged about thirty years. <HI>Mahomet</HI> being come to the <HI>Crown,</HI> be|&s;towed great large&s;&s;es upon his <HI>Janizaries,</HI> and made great preparations for a War again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> Having therefore
<PB N="126" REF="66"> had information, that the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and the <HI>Podolians</HI> were entred into the <HI>League</HI> with the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians,</HI> he &s;ent an Army of an hundred thou&s;and men, under the conduct of <HI>Sinan,</HI> whom he commanded to cha&s;tize the&s;e rebels exemplarily. <HI>Si|nan</HI> prepared him&s;elf to execute the commands he had from his <HI>Ma&s;ter;</HI> and whil&s;t he was endeavouring to gain &s;ome Friends in <HI>Moldavia,</HI> he likewi&s;e rai&s;ed a formidable Army to compleat his de&s;ign. For all this, he was but roughly handled by <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> who follow'd him &s;o clo&s;e at his heels, when he thought to repa&s;s the <HI>Danube,</HI> that the Bridge being over|charged with the numerous Crowds of &s;uch as fled, broke down; and <HI>Sinan</HI> fal|ling into the River, was in great danger of keeping company with an infinite num|ber of his Men, who were then drowned. This action, added to divers others, wherein the good fortune, prudence, and valour of <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> had been manife&s;ted with great &s;plendour, gained him the name of <HI>Invincible,</HI> and forced <HI>Mahomet</HI> to take the conduct of the Army upon him&s;elf. Now does he take the field with two hundred thou&s;and fighting men; and the&s;e dreadfull forces gave him the confidence to advance as far as <HI>Agria.</HI>

In ef|fect, <HI>Boskay,</HI> lo&s;t no time, vanqui&s;h'd <HI>Bel|joyo&s;o,</HI> reduced him to extremity, and &s;ei|zed upon &s;everal places. Then having the <HI>Grandees,</HI> the Cities, and the people on his &s;ide, he put him&s;elf into &s;uch a condition, that he could talk magi&s;terially to them; but <HI>fortune,</HI> who takes delight to make her &s;elf admired, turned to <HI>Ba&s;ta</HI>'s &s;ide, who having gained &s;ome <HI>Victories,</HI> exhorted <HI>Boskay</HI> to quit his <HI>&s;word,</HI> and bow down his Neck to the <HI>Imperial Yoke. Boskay</HI> who pretended to the <HI>Principality,</HI> re|plyed, <HI>That if they did not leave him</HI> Tran&s;ilvania; <HI>if they did not put</HI> Hunga|rian <HI>Officers into the</HI> Provinces, <HI>and in the</HI> Cities <HI>to Govern them; if they did not re|move the foreign</HI> Militia <HI>to &s;ome other places and if they did not allow him the exerci&s;e of his</HI> Religion, <HI>he would rather chu&s;e to pre|fer War, than Peace. Fortune,</HI> which ma|ny times favours the bold, took <HI>Boskay</HI>'s
<PB N="131" REF="68"> part, and made him triumph over all the difficulties he met with in this War. <HI>Ba&s;ta,</HI> who pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t upon him, &s;aw all his Victories turned to an entire and utter di&s;obedience: His Soldiers mutined, telling him, he paid them only with words. They fell upon him in his own Hou&s;e, and tho&s;e very men that were appointed to guard nine and twenty Waggons, laden with Silver, with Cloath and other Stores, plundred them, and e&s;caped &s;ome into <HI>Poland,</HI> and others to the Enemies. Thus <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> being deliver'd from <HI>Ba&s;ta</HI>'s Army, part of the hundred Cities were taken by <HI>Boskay</HI>'s Friends, and the re|mainder &s;urrendred without the trouble of a Summons.

<P>This <HI>Tran&s;ilvanian</HI> endeavour'd all his life-time to fi&s;h in troubled Waters. But the fortune of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the <HI>Emperour,</HI> having the a&s;cendent over his, he was forced in the end to buckle. Let us now &s;ee what hapned in tho&s;e parts, during the <HI>Reign</HI> of <HI>Ferdinand II.</HI> This <HI>Archduke</HI> was the mo&s;t zealous <HI>Catholick</HI> in the World, and one that could the lea&s;t of any man &s;uffer the Religions, which his Predece&s;&s;ors had connived at in their Countries. This zeal, and his good fortune, made the <HI>Emperour Matthias,</HI> his Cou&s;in, prefer him, before all the other <HI>Princes</HI> of his <HI>Hou&s;e;</HI> and who de&s;igning he &s;hould be <HI>Emperour,</HI> after his death, cau&s;ed him to be owned <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohe|mia,</HI> before his decea&s;e. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> began his Reign, with the oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Prote&s;tants:</HI> He commanded &s;ome of their <HI>Churches</HI> to be &s;hut up, and demoli&s;hed &s;ome others in <HI>Bohemia.</HI> He recalled the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and rejected tho&s;e <HI>Articles</HI> that favour'd the <HI>Religionaries,</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="72"> in the <HI>Treaties</HI> made between the <HI>Empe|rours</HI> and the <HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Bohemians.</HI> This proceeding having di&s;plea&s;ed a Body, which at that time was formidable, gave the <HI>Bohemians</HI> occa&s;ion to prefer <HI>Frederick Elector Palatine,</HI> before <HI>Ferdinand:</HI> And immediately he beheld the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> before the walls of his <HI>Capital</HI> City. At the &s;ame time, <HI>Gabor,</HI> armed with the pretence of his <HI>Religion,</HI> entred into the <HI>League,</HI> and rai|&s;ed an Army of eighteen thou&s;and men, &s;trengthned with eighteen pieces of <HI>Can|non,</HI> wherewith he entred into <HI>Hungary;</HI> and finding their &s;pirits inclined to a Re|bellion, he made &s;o great a progre&s;s, as gave him the confidence to be proclaimed <HI>King.</HI> During the&s;e tran&s;actions, <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI> was at <HI>Francfort,</HI> where he was elected Emperour. And this <HI>election</HI> ha|ving given him both authority and forces, he now thought only how to recover the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> he had newly lo&s;t, and to hum|ble tho&s;e that had dared to attaque him. He loudly complained of the inju&s;tice of his adver&s;aries, and having remon&s;trated to the <HI>Electors</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the ju&s;t rea&s;ons he had to regain his own, he drew into his party all the <HI>Catholicks</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> and even the
<PB N="140" REF="73"> <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who had been one of the main Pillars of the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> and held the &s;words of Foreigners within their Scab|berds. Soon after, the <HI>Elector Palatine,</HI> who had taken the Field with very con&s;i|derable Forces, was put to flight. <HI>Gabor,</HI> made a &s;touter re&s;i&s;tance, and had brought the <HI>Emperours</HI> affairs to an ill condition, had his a&s;&s;ociates plaid their part as well at <HI>Prague. Count Dampier, General</HI> of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Forces, lo&s;t his life in going to view the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> of <HI>Presburg,</HI> where <HI>Gabor</HI> had a Garri&s;on. And <HI>Charles de Longve|val, Count Bucquoy,</HI> who after his &s;ubdu|ing of <HI>Moravia,</HI> had made great progre&s;s in <HI>Hungary,</HI> died there being pierced with &s;ixteen wounds. The death of this great man, gave opportunity to <HI>Gabor</HI> to reco|ver many places, to vanqui&s;h tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed his de&s;igns, and range over the whole Countrey. But in fine, &s;eeing his confederates put to flight, and his own Army much weakned, he demanded a <HI>Peace,</HI> and obtained it, Anno 1622. upon the&s;e following conditions. <HI>That he &s;hould keep all</HI> Tran&s;ilvania, Tokay, Ca&s;&s;ovia, <HI>and &s;even other</HI> Lord&s;hips <HI>in</HI> Hungary; <HI>That re&s;igning with the Crown the other Cities which he held in</HI> Hungary, <HI>he &s;hould quit the name of</HI> King, <HI>contenting him&s;elf
<PB N="141" REF="73"> with that of</HI> Prince <HI>of the Empire, and the</HI> Principalities <HI>of</HI> Opelen <HI>and</HI> Ratibor, <HI>and that he &s;hould re&s;tore the</HI> Je&s;uits, <HI>where they had been &s;etled before the War.</HI> This <HI>Peace</HI> la&s;ted not long. <HI>Gabor</HI> gave up <HI>Vaccia</HI> to the <HI>Turk,</HI> who &s;ent him four&s;core thou&s;and men, which the <HI>Count de la Tour,</HI> had procured for him. With the&s;e Troops he invaded <HI>Hungary,</HI> alledging they had not made good to him what was promi|&s;ed by the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Odimburg;</HI> that they oppre&s;&s;ed his <HI>Religion,</HI> and did not deli|ver the money to him, that was his due. The <HI>Emperour</HI> to prevent this growing mi&s;chief, informed the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> that <HI>Gabor</HI> abu&s;ed his Forces, whil&s;t he at|taqued him without cau&s;e or rea&s;on; and adding his Sword to his words, forced his Enemy to an accommodation le&s;s advan|tageous than the former.

This policy appeared but very ill to &s;uch as know, that even good acts do loo&s;e of their va|lue, when done out of &s;ea&s;on. There is nothing that &s;hocks men &s;o much, as a violence again&s;t their <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> and there are few things wherein we ought to have a greater circum&s;pection, than when we go about to reform Religion.

That <HI>Prince</HI> then believing him&s;elf to be more obliged to his Sect, than to his Friend and <HI>Benefactor,</HI> &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be over-per&s;uaded by the <HI>Con|federates Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> who &s;ought his <HI>Al|liance;</HI> and having declared War again&s;t the <HI>Emperour,</HI> he entred <HI>Hungary</HI> with an Army of &s;eventy thou&s;and fighting men. And that it might appear he did not be|gin the War without good rea&s;on; he by a <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> &s;et forth, that &s;ince the year 1619. they placed <HI>Hungary</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Hereditary Provinces</HI> belonging to the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> that they be&s;towed up|on the <HI>Clergy,</HI> tho&s;e employments that appertained to the <HI>Laity,</HI> that they kept the <HI>Protestants</HI> out of all Offices; that they would not hear their complaints and grievances, and that again&s;t their Wills, and without any thing of their con&s;ent or allowance, they had intro|duced the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> into that Countrey. The fir&s;t expedition of <HI>Ragotsky,</HI> was to ravage the Lands of <HI>George Homonay;</HI> af|ter which he &s;ubdued all that oppo&s;ed him even to <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia.</HI> The <HI>Emperour</HI> to put &s;ome &s;top to this torrent, oppo&s;ed him

<P>The people of that Countrey are &s;o Warlike, they &s;carce know how to live in <HI>peace.</HI> And the <HI>Princes</HI> hoping to im|prove their condition do mo&s;t commonly impair it. <HI>Ragotsky</HI> made us &s;ee it clear|ly, when he e&s;pou&s;ed the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Suedens</HI> quarrel, and equally di&s;obliged both the <HI>Emperour,</HI> and the <HI>Sultan.</HI> This <HI>Tran&s;il|vanian,</HI> de&s;iring to have a &s;hare in the glory, and conque&s;ts of <HI>King Charles Gu&s;|tavus,</HI> went and joyned him in <HI>Poland,</HI> with con&s;iderable Forces. And being able to doe no great wonders, was con|&s;trained to retire, either with a great deal of &s;hame, or with very little reputation. His misfortune did not however end with the lo&s;s of his Army; he was per&s;ecuted yet more, his ill fate armed the <HI>Turk</HI> a|gain&s;t him, and &s;lew him in a Battel, where|in he lo&s;t his life, together with that Countrey he might have left to his Son. Some have written that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> ex|cited the <HI>Turk</HI> again&s;t him, and that was one of the chiefe&s;t cau&s;es of this pre&s;ent War; <HI>Kemin Janos,</HI> his Lieutenant Ge|neral, endeavour'd to get into his place, and to attain his ends, he did &s;ubmit to his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;ty,</HI> &s;ought for and obtained his protection. But he could not pre|&s;erve that E&s;tate, which he had &s;eized
<PB N="148" REF="77"> on. It was then, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vien|na,</HI> de&s;iring to maintain <HI>Janos,</HI> without exa&s;perating the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> could effect neither the one, nor the other. <HI>Janos</HI> was lo&s;t in a Battel, and the <HI>Turk</HI> was di&s;&s;atisfied with the <HI>Emperour,</HI> who, (as he &s;aid) had infringed the <HI>Truce,</HI> which was between them. This mi&s;under&s;tan|ding heated both parties, and occa&s;ioned &s;everal Emba&s;&s;ies, and <HI>Negociations</HI> on ei|ther &s;ide. The <HI>Sultan</HI> declared that he intended nothing but to maintain the <HI>Peace;</HI> and his Subjects mode&s;tly complained of us, &s;aying that we de&s;ired a War, and they would make none, unle&s;s they were compell'd to it by nece&s;&s;ity. During the&s;e wranglings, <HI>Nicholas Count Serini</HI> believed the War was already at our Doors, and imagining it would be &s;ome advantage to him, to build a <HI>Fort</HI> upon the Banks of the River <HI>Mur:</HI> he did &s;o, and began &s;ome Ho&s;tilities. This <HI>Fort</HI> gave the <HI>Turk</HI> greater cau&s;e of complaint, who deman|ded it &s;hould be demoli&s;hed by a <HI>Chiaux,</HI> and by an <HI>Aga,</HI> whom I &s;aw at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the month of <HI>January</HI> one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty two. The&s;e demands had no favourable an&s;wers; but it &s;eemed as if they had talked to deaf man. And, to tell the truth, ob&s;erving that haughti|ne&s;s,
<PB N="149" REF="77"> and re&s;olution to give the <HI>Turk</HI> no &s;atisfaction, I concluded that they would have a War; and that the <HI>Fort</HI> of <HI>Serini,</HI> was a place, would make work enough for &s;everal <HI>Ottoman</HI> Armies. Yet expe|rience hath &s;hewed us, that the &s;aid <HI>Fort</HI> was worth nothing, and that we had no need to undertake a War of &s;uch impor|tance for it. I &s;hall not lay down the rea&s;ons, becau&s;e any one may ea&s;ily gue&s;s them. It &s;hall &s;uffice I tell you, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Forces in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and fearing to be taken unprovided; they &s;ent the <HI>Counts de Montecuculi,</HI> and <HI>Souches,</HI> into the Field with two &s;mall Bodies of men: But a good part of them were de&s;troy'd without gi|ving a blow, or preventing the lo&s;s of <HI>Kemin Janos,</HI> or the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>A|baffi.</HI> The <HI>Sultan,</HI> therefore &s;eeing that <HI>Tran&s;ilvania</HI> was in his power, and that <HI>Abaffi</HI> was fa&s;t in the Saddle, and obliged to &s;erve him, demanded again with grea|ter in&s;tance, that the <HI>Fort Serini</HI> &s;hould be demoli&s;hed, and reparation made for the injuries, he &s;aid, they had done him. For all this, could they not re&s;olve to grant him what he asked: &s;o that with|out more adoe, he re&s;olved to take his own &s;atisfaction, and try whether his fir&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="78"> Warlike enterprize, would prove as hap|py, as he thought it ju&s;t. He therefore began that War, which he pro&s;ecutes to this day, with much heat, and in which all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> &s;eems to have a &s;hare. I conjure you to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, what I have told you till this pre&s;ent, and I am confident you may rightly judge of the ju&s;tice of both parties in this controver&s;ie. We mu&s;t now &s;ee, after what manner the <HI>Turk</HI> attaqued us in the year 1661. with what Forces we oppo&s;ed him, and what either of them hath acted &s;ince the beginning of this War; that &s;o you may the better apprehend what we are to fear; and what we may rea&s;onably hope.</P>

The quick &s;ighted judged rightly, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to levy men; and the more &s;tupid &s;aid, that there was no tru&s;ting of &s;uch, as have no faith in them. The <HI>Emperour</HI> finding he &s;hould have need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, de&s;ired &s;ome; and the very formalities of giving, and of receiving it, was the cau&s;e they were not in a readine&s;s when the bu&s;ine&s;s began. The <HI>Confederates</HI> offer'd con&s;ide|rable forces, which they had already on foot; but they would have the command over them; and his Maje&s;ty thought, that it would be an affront to his dignity to receive them upon tho&s;e terms. The <HI>Empire</HI> making the &s;ame offers, and the &s;ame demands, met with the &s;ame diffi|culties;

<P>The Treaty that was concluded at <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> upon the 24. of <HI>October</HI> 1648, ha|ving yielded up &s;ome Lands to the <HI>French,</HI> and to the <HI>Suedes,</HI> as likewi&s;e to &s;ome Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> they all feared that the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> would repent
<PB N="153" REF="79"> the having bought &s;uch a Peace: that they would endeavour to recover what had been di&s;membred from the <HI>Empire;</HI> and that &s;ome others would demand what they had lo&s;t. To obviate the&s;e inconveniences, the <HI>Cardinal Mazarin,</HI> per&s;uaded tho&s;e that had any cau&s;e of fear, and &s;uch as de&s;ired the peace of the <HI>Em|pire,</HI> that it were fit they &s;hould unite more clo&s;ely, and engage to defend each other mutually, in ca&s;e they &s;hould hap|pen to be mole&s;ted in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of what the Treaty had adjudged to them. Ten or twelve <HI>Princes,</HI> as well <HI>Eccle&s;ia|&s;ticks</HI> as <HI>Seculars,</HI> and of all <HI>Religions</HI> al|lowed in the <HI>Empire,</HI> entred into this League. And every one having taxed him&s;elf proportionably to his forces, they to this purpo&s;e de&s;igned to have about five and twenty thou&s;and men, under the conduct of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Salmes,</HI> and of <HI>Count Holach.</HI> The <HI>Emperour,</HI> to whom this thing was highly di&s;ta&s;tfull, endea|vour'd to di&s;&s;olve them, and not being able to compa&s;s the &s;ame, he endeavour'd to turn it to his own advantage. To this effect, finding he was now threatned with a War by the <HI>Turk,</HI> he remon&s;tra|ted the approaching danger, and de&s;ired tho&s;e Troops might be employed for the
<PB N="154" REF="80"> defence of the <HI>Empire.</HI> The <HI>Confederates</HI> con&s;ented thereto, upon condition they &s;hould be &s;worn to none but them&s;elves, nor &s;hould be employed again&s;t any but the common enemy.

<P>That I may an&s;wer your que&s;tion in one entire di&s;cour&s;e, you mu&s;t know, That the <HI>Turk</HI> having re&s;olved to cut us out work, he &s;ent his <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> into <HI>Hungary,</HI> who arrived at <HI>Belgrade</HI> the 8th of <HI>June.</HI> The <HI>Baron de Gois</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;ty,</HI> came thither the day after; and the eighteenth he was conducted into the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Vizier.</HI> He had then on his left hand two of his <HI>Brothers,</HI> on his right the <HI>Mufti,</HI> and a|bout his Per&s;on near two hundred <HI>Officers.</HI> In this fir&s;t audience, the <HI>Baron</HI> having made his Complement to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> he told him, he was come thither to conclude the Treaty that had been begun betwixt him and <HI>Aly Ba&s;&s;a.</HI> They let him know that it was too late, and that they would think further on it when they were upon our <HI>Frontiers.</HI> The <HI>Baron</HI> replied, they were then to blame to make him come thither, that he could not under&s;tand why they refu&s;ed to conclude it, that they &s;hould meet with greater difficulties when the War was begun: And that <HI>God</HI> would puni&s;h tho&s;e who &s;hould be the cau&s;e of &s;hedding innocent blood. The <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> an&s;wer'd, that he had weighed tho&s;e rea&s;ons very maturely be|ing at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and that in ca&s;e

<P>I believe &s;o too, and do not think that an Officer, how great &s;oever in me|rit and reputation, dur&s;t have taken any re&s;olutions contrary to tho&s;e his <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> had pre&s;cribed him. The Army there|fore
<PB N="157" REF="81"> began to file away upon the 11th of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1663. And this was done with &s;o much pomp, that one would have judged it to con&s;i&s;t of two hundred thou&s;and fighting men. The noi&s;e of the <HI>Camels,</HI> the <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Mules,</HI> the ratling of the <HI>Drums</HI> and <HI>Timbals,</HI> and the &s;ound of their <HI>Trumpets,</HI> la&s;ted both day and night till the eighteenth of the &s;ame month. The <HI>Officers</HI> moved &s;lowly, and although &s;ome or other marched every day, they were mo&s;t of them <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s with their equipage, which being magnificent, made a &s;tately &s;how, and appeared great to admiration. In fine, the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Janizaries</HI> parted the fifteenth with four thou&s;and of his companions, and was followed by the re&s;t of the Army till the eighteenth, at which time the <HI>Grand Vi|zier</HI> went on his way, with a mo&s;t royal magnificence. He &s;ent a thou&s;and foot before him, with each a led hor&s;e or two in their hands. After the&s;e marched the <HI>Spahi-Alagar&s;i,</HI> who is General of tho&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that &s;erve on hor&s;eback, prece|ded by his great <HI>Standard,</HI> and followed by &s;ix hundred <HI>Spahi-Edeli,</HI> who are the mo&s;t valiant of all <HI>Turky,</HI> having their <HI>Cornets</HI> very prettily adorned. The&s;e were followed by a long Staff, at the top
<PB N="158" REF="82"> whereof was a large bra&s;s button, from whence hung down a <HI>Hor&s;e-tail.</HI> Soon after were &s;eeen two great <HI>Guidons,</HI> which they carried before the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Brothers, and other Per&s;ons of Quality and com|mand, who were accompanied by &s;even hundred <HI>Ha&s;vadars,</HI> or Valets, mo&s;t of them covered with Coats of Mail, from the crown of the head, down to the knees. At la&s;t the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s En&s;igns and Guidons marched, and were immediate|ly followed by &s;ixteen led Hor&s;es, with Saddles and Hou&s;ins embroider'd with Gold, and Precious Stones. The Grooms that led them, had Cloath of Gold Ve&s;ts, and Breeches of Crim&s;on Velvet. Eight of the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Footmen had the like cloa|thing, and he went in the mid&s;t of the&s;e, accompanied by two <HI>Janizaries,</HI> wearing upon his head a <HI>Turban</HI> of great price. After the <HI>Vizier</HI> came the <HI>Ro&s;evendy,</HI> or great <HI>Chancellor;</HI> the <HI>Te&s;datir,</HI> or Com|mi&s;&s;ary General, and &s;ome other of the principal <HI>Officers</HI> of the Army: The <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the <HI>Chamber,</HI> all young Fel|lows of twenty or thirty years, cover'd with Jacquets: Six hundred <HI>Ha&s;vadars,</HI> forty <HI>Cimbali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Trumpeters;</HI> two hundred ordinary Hor&s;e-men, and three|&s;core Hor&s;es, that carried the <HI>Grand Vi|zier</HI>'s
<PB N="159" REF="82"> <HI>Tents</HI> and <HI>Pavillions.</HI> With this mag|nificent and dreadfull train, he arrived at <HI>Bukovar</HI> the four and twentieth; and there he was informed by the <HI>Aga</HI> whom he had &s;ent to the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> that in&s;tead of four&s;core thou&s;and men he had promi&s;ed, he would &s;end ten thou&s;and, under the conduct of his Son. The ex|cu&s;e he made for not keeping his word was, that the white <HI>Tartars</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI> had made &s;ome incur&s;ions into his Countrey, which obliged him to keep his men for the defence of his <HI>Frontiers.</HI> Two days after he got to <HI>E&s;eck,</HI> where he &s;ojourned eight or ten days, waiting for &s;uch as were to joyn him. At la&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Bridge,</HI> which is above twelve thou&s;and paces in length, and arrived at <HI>Buda</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>July.</HI> There it was, that after they had held divers <HI>Councils,</HI> the Siege of <HI>Neuhu&s;el</HI> was re&s;olved, and the &s;eventh of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the place was inve&s;|ted.

<P>It is probable they might have held out longer: but there being no relief to be expected, they mu&s;t in fine, have been compell'd to &s;ubmit to their Enemies. They endured three a&s;&s;aults, wherein the <HI>Turks</HI> were vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed. Howe|ver the <HI>Count Forgats</HI> their Governour was confin'd, and accu&s;ed for not having done his duty in that Siege. But I be|lieve it was more his unhappine&s;s, than his Crime, that lo&s;t it: It was reported here, when this &s;trong <HI>Fortre&s;s</HI> was taken, that the Officers were young, and with|out experience. And on the contrary the <HI>Vizier</HI> was a Per&s;on about the Age of five and thirty, active, and diligent in his ex|peditions, skilfull in the Mathematicks, of an heroick courage; and who was day and night in the Trenches, both to en|courage his Soldiers, and to &s;hew them a brave example. This place being taken, he cau&s;ed &s;even pieces of Cannon to be fired in token of <HI>Victory.</HI> And having &s;ent one of his Brothers to the <HI>Port,</HI> to carry the news of it to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> he began to repair the Breaches; and then retired, to prepare him&s;elf for the
<PB N="161" REF="83"> next <HI>Campagne.</HI> This lo&s;s awakened the <HI>Empire,</HI> which &s;eemed to have lain a&s;leep, and the Diet having been called at <HI>Rati&s;|bon,</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Princes</HI> appeared there in Per&s;on, the re&s;t by their <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors.</HI> There was the magnificence of our <HI>Ger|many</HI> to be &s;een: For although the <HI>Em|perour</HI> had de&s;ired the <HI>Potentates</HI> to come without any pomp, yet nothing appeared but what was brave and &s;tately. Divers old <HI>Officers</HI> came to offer their <HI>Swords</HI> to the <HI>Emperour.</HI> And tho&s;e <HI>Princes</HI> who were no &s;trangers to the &s;mell of <HI>Gun-powder</HI> pre&s;ented them&s;elves to command the o|ther. The Number and merit of the pretenders did as much puzzle his Maje&s;ty in the liberty of his choice, as the great variety of <HI>Flowers</HI> in Summer does the Ladies in a curious Garden. He mu&s;t however re&s;olve, and chu&s;e Comman|ders for the new Bodies they were going to rai&s;e. The <HI>Emperour</HI> who had already three Armies under the conduct of the <HI>Counts de Serini, Montecuculi</HI> and <HI>Souches,</HI> de&s;ired to make them more capable to undertake &s;omewhat extraordinary. To this end, without changing the inferiour Officers, and leaving the Sovereign com|mand to the&s;e Counts, he joyned with them <HI>Philip Prince Palatine</HI> of the branch
<PB N="162" REF="84"> of <HI>Sultzbac,</HI> and Count <HI>Spar,</HI> per&s;ons of merit and great reputation. The fir&s;t commanded his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Hor&s;e, in qua|lity of <HI>Captain General,</HI> and the other led the Foot, and the <HI>Cannon. Leopold Willi|am, Marqui&s;s</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> was <HI>General</HI> in <HI>Chief</HI> of the Army belonging to the <HI>Em|pire.

This <HI>Siege</HI> was bloody, and having weakned the Be&s;iegers, and la&s;ted longer than was expected, the <HI>Enemy</HI> approached, and made them rai&s;e the Siege.

<P>THE <HI>French King</HI> having promi&s;ed to <HI>Count Strozzi</HI> that number of Men he had de&s;ired in the name of the <HI>Empe|rour,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this <HI>Campagne</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> &s;ome of his <HI>Infantry,</HI> who were marched into <HI>Provence,</HI> upon another de|&s;ign, and &s;ome <HI>Cavalry</HI> at that time in <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Parma,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Fueillade,</HI> had orders to march into <HI>Germany</HI> forthwith.

So that judging he &s;hould not be in a capacity to make good this <HI>Campagne</HI> a|gain&s;t &s;uch numerous forces, nor avoid the fatal con&s;equences of the &s;torm that threatned him, he went per&s;onally to the <HI>Diet</HI> of <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> to re&s;olve with the <HI>Electors,</HI> what means they might be&s;t take to pre&s;erve the <HI>Empire</HI> from the ap|proaching danger: &s;oon after this <HI>Diet,</HI> there were levies made all over <HI>Germany,</HI> and the <HI>French King,</HI> as <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> obliged him&s;elf to furni&s;h eight <HI>Companies,</HI> and forty <HI>Cornets</HI> of Hor&s;e, which were to make up a body of &s;ix thou&s;and Men, to be defraid during the whole <HI>Campagne</HI> at the expence of his <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI> The <HI>Count de Coligny</HI> had the command of them, and under him <HI>de la Fueillade,</HI> and <HI>Bodvis Mare&s;hals de Camp.</HI></P>

<PB N="176" REF="91">
<P><HI>Coligny</HI> arrived at <HI>Metz</HI> the 25th of <HI>April,</HI> where the Hor&s;e, and tho&s;e that went <HI>Voluntiers</HI> in this expedition, waited for him.</P>
<P>All the&s;e were divided into ten <HI>Squa|drons,</HI> and the <HI>Squadrons</HI> into four <HI>Bri|gades,</HI> under <HI>de Ga&s;&s;ion, Desfourneaux,</HI> and <HI>de Beauvez&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>They received Orders to march to|wards <HI>Colmar,</HI> a City in <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> which refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the conditions pro|pounded to them by the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Maza|rin,</HI> Governour of that Province.</P>
<P>Now to pa&s;s over the particulars of their March, which is not very material, the <HI>French</HI> came at length near the famous City of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and encamped within a League of that place, where the &s;ix Re|giments of <HI>Piedmont, E&s;pernon, Granc&eacute;,</HI> and the re&s;t were joyned, and after two days re&s;pite, they went forwards. The Emperour being come thither to Hunt, and lodge near their Quarters, &s;aw the &s;aid &s;ix Regiments in <HI>Battalia,</HI> and the next day came again accompanied by di|vers per&s;ons of quality, and his ordinary Guards.</P>
<P>The <HI>Emperour</HI> then pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Coligny</HI> to go and joyn the <HI>German</HI> Army, which lay encamped behind the Fort
<PB N="177" REF="91"> <HI>Serin.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> did afterwards attack it, and rai&s;ed al&s;o the &s;iege of <HI>Cani&s;ia,</HI> and about the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> news came it was taken by a&s;&s;ault, though a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Imperial Army. Seven or eight hun|dred of the Men that were to maintain it peri&s;hed, and the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e that endeavour'd to retire towards the Bridge, which made the communication between the Fort and the Army were cut off. This unwelcome news retarded their March, and it was certainly dan|gerous to go to <HI>Markburg,</HI> as had been intended, to wait for the Hor&s;e that were coming from <HI>Italy,</HI> and tho&s;e other that parted from us at <HI>Donavert</HI> when the Foot embarqued.</P>
<P>Being in the <HI>French</HI> Army my &s;elf, I &s;hall, and cannot forbear, to call it our Army, for which you mu&s;t excu&s;e me, and therefore to go on, I mu&s;t let you know, that after con&s;ultation, they chan|ged their former mea&s;ures, and took their road by the Mountains of <HI>Styria</HI> towards <HI>Rakelsburg.</HI> We began this march upon the &s;eventh of <HI>July</HI> by the Plain near <HI>Neu&s;tadt,</HI> and the &s;ame day pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Leytha,</HI> which parts <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> from <HI>Hungary.</HI> From thence we went on by <HI>Odemburg,</HI> which is a pretty large Town,
<PB N="178" REF="92"> and &s;o towards <HI>Fur&s;tenfelt;</HI> a City fortified with &s;ix Ba&s;tions, but ill &s;ituated.</P>
<P>From thence our march was very trouble&s;ome through the Mountains to <HI>Rakelsburgh,</HI> where we arrived on the nine and twentieth. It is &s;ituate in an I&s;land, encompa&s;&s;ed by the River <HI>Muer,</HI> towards the Plain it is fortified with &s;ome Ba&s;tions, and half Moons, the Ditches are large, deep, and full of Water. The left arm of the River pa&s;&s;es within a little di&s;tance of the Out-works, the right is nearer yet: but the Fortifications on this &s;ide are not &s;o good as the other; and they were then at work with great dili|gence: and be&s;ides, this place is comman|ded by a high piece of ground, within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, upon which &s;tands a Ca|&s;tle, guarded by &s;ome Out-forts, built at the point of the hill which faces the Town.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Turks</HI> had taken, and razed the great Fort of <HI>Serini,</HI> the Imperial Army repa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Muer,</HI> to draw the nearer to <HI>Rakelsburg,</HI> and cover the Countrey the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the incur&s;i|ons of the enemies.</P>
<P>This Movement gave <HI>Coligny</HI> the grea|ter facility to joyn them, which he did upon the 22d day of <HI>July,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as he
<PB N="179" REF="92"> was informed of the news, by <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Bodvis,</HI> whom he had &s;ent purpo&s;ely for intelligence.</P>
<P>When we joyned the Army, they were encamped in one Line; the <HI>Empe|rour</HI>'s forces had the right; tho&s;e of the <HI>Empire</HI> were in the mid&s;t, commanded by the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Baden;</HI> and &s;uch as be|longed to the Allies had the left, com|manded by <HI>Count Hollach;</HI> ours po&s;ted them&s;elves upon the left of the&s;e la&s;t.</P>
<P>On the three and twentieth word was brought to the General <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> marched along the River <HI>Raab</HI> to find an ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age, with de&s;ign to enter the Countrey. He took a re&s;oluti|on to march with all the Hor&s;e towards <HI>Kermain,</HI> a little Town &s;ituate upon the River, and leave the Foot and Baggage, with orders to follow him in ha&s;te.</P>
<P>The &s;even and twentieth, <HI>Spork,</HI> Ge|neral of the <HI>German</HI> Foot, who conducted them, &s;ent to <HI>la Fueillade</HI> to march im|mediately, becau&s;e he had notice that the Enemy approached: and to confirm the Me&s;&s;age, he order'd &s;ome Volleys of Cannon to be fired from their Camp at St. <HI>Gottard,</HI> where they arrived that morning. This advice obliged us to leave the Baggage with a &s;lender guard,
<PB N="180" REF="93"> and ha&s;ten the march, to joyn the re&s;t of the forces at St. <HI>Gottard.</HI></P>
<P>They encamped very clo&s;e to avoid &s;ome hills which reigned all along the face of the Camp, and were of too large extent to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Infantry of three Armies.</P>
<P>Our Troops had the left of the Camp, which was on the Enemies &s;ide. The night was &s;pent in making an intrench|ment, and by morning it was pretty well fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the mean time the City Bridges were repairing, the place being but &s;mall and much ruined. Its &s;ituation is at the confluence of the <HI>Raab,</HI> and the <HI>Laufsnitz:</HI> but whatever diligence they u&s;ed in ma|king up the Bridges, the &s;ame could not be compleated till the morning of the eight and twentieth.</P>
<P>Then the Baggage began to go forward, and took up the pa&s;&s;age for a whole day. The following night two thou&s;and Foot were commanded to go and joyn the Hor&s;e at <HI>Kermain.</HI> But &s;carce had they began their march, when news came, that the Enemy, after they had been repul&s;ed at <HI>Kermain,</HI> marched directly along the River to St. <HI>Gottard.</HI></P>
<PB N="181" REF="93">
<P>This action was honourable to the <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e, the <HI>Turks</HI> attempting their pa&s;&s;age in two &s;everal places directly be|fore them: the one being towards the Bridge they were repairing, and which was guarded by &s;ome <HI>Hungarians;</HI> the other at a Ford below it; and to favour the <HI>Tartars</HI> in this pa&s;&s;age, who had un|dertaken it, they had cau&s;ed a con&s;idera|ble body of <HI>Janizaries</HI> to advance to the brink of the River, who by their fire, thought to have made them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters. They were repul&s;ed every where with great vigour, and for want of In|fantry to oppo&s;e them, there were &s;ome Hor&s;e commanded to &s;erve on Foot with Mu&s;quetoons, the better to maintain this attack, where the <HI>Sieur de la Chau,</HI> a Captain who had the guard of the Ford, with four&s;core <HI>Mai&s;tres,</HI> bravely repul|&s;ed all that endeavour'd to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>In this combat the Enemies lo&s;t a <HI>Pa|&s;haw,</HI> named <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> and &s;ome con&s;ide|rable per&s;ons on our &s;ide were &s;lain: the <HI>Chevalier de Saint Aignan,</HI> and <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Cha&s;teau-neuf Aide de Camp, de Sault</HI> and <HI>de Treville</HI> were wounded.</P>

<P>The Hor&s;e, who had taken their way by land, and were &s;eparated from the Foot at <HI>Donavert,</HI> did this day joyn the Army, having left part of their Baggage behind, to march with the greater &s;peed.

<P>When they were driven into that cor|ner, they had no other choice, but either to make good their retrenchments, or

<P>The better part of the Succe&s;s of this illu&s;trious Action is owing to the <HI>French</HI> Nation, who though but few in Num|ber, and without any very con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Imperiali&s;ts, were able to overcome an Enemy entrenched, and who had the advantages of the place.

And in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> the Armies being encamped near <HI>Virtemburg,</HI> there came News that the Enemies were to pa&s;s the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Gran,</HI> to enter upon <HI>Hungary;</HI> this made them change the de&s;ign they had concluded on to march along that River to the Cities of <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Comorra,</HI> and to pa&s;s afterwards over
<PB N="198" REF="102"> a Bridge of Boats at <HI>Presburg,</HI> and oppo&s;e their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>They marched therefore near <HI>Hue&s;en</HI> and <HI>Tirnaw,</HI> towards the River <HI>Vagh,</HI> which runs near <HI>Neuheu&s;el,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Danube</HI> above <HI>Comorra.</HI> Then did there come intelligence that the <HI>Turks</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed, but none could preci&s;ely tell what their re&s;olutions were; it was at fir&s;t believed they would be&s;iege <HI>Levens,</HI> &s;ituate between <HI>Neuheu&s;el</HI> and <HI>Gran,</HI> which had been taken at the beginning of the <HI>Campagne</HI> by Count <HI>Souches,</HI> but in the end we under&s;tood that it was but a party which they had detached to rein|force <HI>Neuheu&s;el,</HI> and po&s;t them&s;elves be|hind it to hinder the be&s;ieging it.</P>
<P>A great train of Artillery which the Emperour &s;ent to his Army, had given them this jealou&s;ie: They were then po&s;ted at the Mouth of the <HI>Vagh,</HI> behind was a Bridge on the <HI>Danube</HI> to pa&s;s into the I&s;land of <HI>Schut,</HI> where the Forces under Count <HI>Souches</HI> were encamped. This re-inforcement made them delibe|rate to go and attack the <HI>Turks</HI> in their po&s;t, and &s;everal days were vainly &s;pent in the&s;e deliberations, there being always &s;ome ob&s;tacle or other that hindred the execution, and as if there had been &s;ome
<PB N="199" REF="102"> conte&s;ts between Count <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> and the Commanders of the <HI>French</HI> Forces, who &s;uffer'd very much after the Battel, and demanded provi&s;ions with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s: It was perceived that this <HI>Italian</HI> General, &s;ubtile no doubt, but of that &s;ort of &s;ubtilty ordinary in tho&s;e of his Nati|on, and fitter for the Cabinet Council, than at the head of an Army, intended nothing le&s;s, than to march again&s;t the Enemy, and who affected that pretence &s;o much, only becau&s;e he &s;aw the Army &s;o hara&s;&s;ed and weather-beaten, that thereby he might in &s;ome &s;ort dimini&s;h the honour they had acquired at St. <HI>Godthard,</HI> by the reproaches he made, that we were the cau&s;e of hindring that de&s;ign; he indeed nobly propo&s;ed it the fir&s;t, though he had no mind to put it in practi&s;e, as being a&s;&s;ured that a Treaty of Peace was then on foot, which had for &s;ome time been &s;ecretly managed for his Ma&s;ter: But the better to conceal his intentions he had marched towards the head of the <HI>Vagh,</HI> making a &s;how as if he would draw nearer the Enemy, for that purpo&s;e. The <HI>French</HI> Troops being ill guided in this march, found them&s;elves upon the two and twentieth within five little leagues of <HI>Neuheu&s;el,</HI> and di&s;tant
<PB N="200" REF="103"> from the re&s;t of the Army above two, in danger of being &s;urprized, becau&s;e the River that lay before them was fordable in many places, and the mi&s;take was not found out till towards noon. <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Coligny</HI> being fallen &s;ick, and car|ried to <HI>Tirnau: Mon&s;ieur de la Fueillade</HI> in his ab&s;cence cau&s;ed them forthwith to march off, and rejoyn the gro&s;s of the Army, the <HI>Turks</HI> not having attempted any thing upon us: They had &s;ome few days before, defeated a party of <HI>German</HI> Hor&s;e, and by the return of &s;ome of tho&s;e Pri&s;oners we fir&s;t heard the News of the Peace in the Camp, and the Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms was proclaimed upon the thirtieth of <HI>September,</HI> the conditions thereof were as follows.</P>
