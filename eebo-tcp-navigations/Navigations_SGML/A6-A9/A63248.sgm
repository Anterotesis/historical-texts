<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE Observations of the same Nature with those which follow, have prevail'd of late for a general Approbation; and it has been more acceptable to the Reader to make En|quiries into the Imperfections of the People which have given Being to the Papers under his Perusal, than to search after their Excellencies and survey their Beauties; I could not but think it adviseable to gratify his Palate, and consult my own Interest, in presenting him with the following Remarks. And as two other Authors (<HI>viz.</HI> those of the Trips to <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>) have giv'n him the sight of Monsters of a Foreign Growth, and one of 'em under no dependance on the English Government; so I have now remov'd the Scene, and brought my Farce to be acted in a Country which Dr. <HI>Molineux,</HI> a late Writer, would insinuate to be independent on the British Nation, tho' re|duc'd by Force of Arms to acknowledge her Conquest. If <HI>Teigue</HI> can but please as well as <HI>Myn-Heer,</HI> the Bookseller has gain'd his Aim, the Author his, and the Reader more than He could ex|pect, since in drawing the Picture of a <HI>Dutch Man</HI> he might have thought Nature had been exhausted of all her Deformities. But <HI>Michael Angelo</HI>'s Cardinal in his representation of the Day of Iudgment is a Beauty to an <HI>Irish Man,</HI> who tho' he does not look with the same Horror for his Crimes as his <HI>Diabolical Eminence,</HI> yet takes Pains to merit the same Punishment; and its enough to send one in Search of the Parish-Register to know the Truth of his Nativity, if one of the meaner sort of this People happens to be suspected of Honesty.</P>
<P>As for the Nobility, who are generally sprung from English Parentage, here are those who are renown'd for their Valour, admir'd for their Iustice, and esteem'd for their Wisdom; and we have seen those Things perform'd by the present Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arran</HI> his Grace's Noble Brother, which have been the admiration of this Age, as they will com|mand
<PB REF="3">
the Wonder of the Times which succeed. But Pane|gyrick is not my Business; and I who am to give such a Descri|ption of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as should make my Reader laugh at its Inha|bitants, should not dwell on two such Instances in its Commenda|tion, unless I would be laught at my self.</P>
<P>To go on therefore with my Subject, and persuade the Buyer as much as I can that he has a very good Bargain, and enough in Conscience for his Mony; here are the Vices of all Nations practis'd by those People, who have not Wit enough to know but what they are solely of their own Growth, and who if they should chance to be told by some one among 'em that can read, that other Nations are guilty of the same Sins, would bite their Nails off but they would find out some less common Road to Damnation. In short, that I may'nt make the Porch too big for the House, and that the Reader may not expect more Matter than I can afford him; in order to proportion the Treatise to the Preface, I shall have said as much as I design, if I tell him, That the People of the Kingdom I give him the Description of, have the Cruelty of a <HI>Spanish Inquisitor,</HI> the Letchery of an <HI>Italian,</HI> the Levity of a <HI>French Man,</HI> the Cowardice of a <HI>Savoyard,</HI> the Perfidiousness of a <HI>Scotch Man,</HI> the Ignorance of a <HI>Muscovite,</HI> the rebellious Temper of a <HI>Dutch Man,</HI> and the Pride of&mdash;themselves; and if all this Bundle of Vice won't content him, let him show me so many Virtues in pra|ctice among 'em, and he shan't ask me twice to be satisfied.</P>

<HEAD>A Trip to Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I enter into the Character of the People, it will not be improper to acquaint my Reader with the Motives which induc'd me to make Ob|servations upon 'em, since I who am about to give him an account of others, may perhaps b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter"> expected to give some account of my self. Let it therefore sufficee if I tell him, the same Curiosity which leads him to the perusal of these Remarks, prevaild upon me to make 'em; And as I am not arrived to the years of those Men, who think no Country deserving of their Notice, but that in which they were born, so my Inclinations are wholly differ|ent from theirs. In short, I was forc'd to make a loose from Old <HI>England,</HI> and since I had no green Turf of my own to tread upon, in it, I was resolv'd to set Sail for a place, whither few, but those in the same condition with my self, would direct their Course.</P>
<P>And as it was not impossible but I might recover the esteem of my Friends, which I had unhappily lost; so I was resolv'd against my coming again into favour, to furnish my self with some Story or other to en|tertain their Maids with, like other young Travellers, in order to continue in their esteem. For it's as common now, for an insinuating Servant to alienate a Mothers affection from her Son, or a Sisters from her Brother, as it is for 'em to lie with their Masters, or wear their Mistresses old Cloaths.</P>
<P>Pursuant to to these Inclinations, I pick't up what Money I could, and went Aboard the <HI>Owners-Love,</HI> a Ship in the River which was bound for <HI>Ireland</HI>; The Commander had laid in <HI>Vsquebaugh</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> enough, and so I held my self con|tented: and what added to my satisfaction, was, that I did not want for Com|pany to divert my self with, during my Voyage. Three of the Directors of the Old <HI>East-India-Company</HI> had just brought in their Goods before I came aboard, and several who had considerable Posts in the Office of <HI>Land-Credit</HI> were making the best of their way off with 'em; we had also a <HI>Bawd,</HI> who had been forc'd to quit her Venerable Station, on account of the Act against <HI>Prophanness</HI> and <HI>Immorality</HI>; and a <HI>Poet</HI> who had lost all hopes of a good third Day in <HI>England,</HI> since Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s <HI>Short View of the</HI> English <HI>Stage</HI> had made its appearance in publick. For my part, I thought the Man of Metre much in the right, and since Hot-Beds are generally made out of Dunghills, the only way to ripen and secure the growth of his Muse, was to transplant her to an Isle where there is nothing else. In short, whilest the three Directors were railing against <HI>Heathcot</HI> and <HI>Shepherd,</HI> and the No-Landed Land-Credit-Men were cursing Dr. <HI>Chamberlain</HI>; The <HI>Poet</HI> being wholy taken up in biting his Nails, and making wry Faces, as taking leave (as I suppose) of his Mistress in some dolefull Sonnet, or meditating on some Invective against <HI>Collier</HI> who had made him step aside; I could not but take incitement from his odd sort of Gestures, to attempt something in Verse too; and since I had learn'd something by playing at Crambo formerly with my Mo|thers Maids, and could Write and Read (the chief Excellencies of <HI>Poets</HI> now a days) I e'en went above-deck, and took my leave of that Famous City, which fled from our sight, as we fled from it, by Penning down the following Lines.</P>

</LG>
<P>These were the hasty Thoughts I committed to Paper; and I who retir'd to my Muse to divert my self, found that instead of removing from the Ideas of those Troubles I would have avoided, I had by making Application to Her, a more lively Representation of 'em. Wherefore I return'd again to my Com|pany, whom I found sitting in for a hearty Cup, the only Preservative against Melancholly. You may judge I wanted not many Persuasions to make one among 'em, and to endeavour the dislodgment of a Guest, which had taken up free Quarters, and liv'd at descretion, as the Temper I was then in had. Accord|ingly I pledg'd the Bawd, who I must tell you, took something of a liking to me, and did me the honour to drink to me so heartily, and I over my left Thumb, <HI>Et sic deinceps</HI>; that the <HI>East-India</HI> Bankrupts had quite forgot that another Company had got the Royal Establishment, the Land-Credit Men were in such a Temper, as if the Iron Chests they have laid in at their Office in <HI>Queen-street,</HI> were full of those Millions the Undertaker propos'd to have in 'em; and the Virginity Broker, and the Haberdasher of <HI>Hexameters</HI> were as merry, as if each of 'em had Acts of Parliament for their respective Employs: And I, for my part, with my illuminated Phiz, and my Eyes ready to drop out of my Head, had such entertaining Conceptions, that I could not but imagine my Fortunes bore a Proportion to my Countenance, and had never been under any such thing as an Eclypse. In short, not to be tedious, we did not spare the Bottle during our Voyage, and had such a smooth Passage over St. <HI>George</HI> his Channel, as if <HI>Neptune</HI> had known us all to be Bankrupts, and consequently not worth the drowning; since we had nothing to feed his Luxury with but our Flesh, and that was meat hardly good enough for the Fish. But since the Reader may be in haste to know something of the Country we were bound for, I shall close the Journal at Sea, by telling him we got safe to <HI>Dublin</HI>; where, as it was our Business to con|ceal our selves, we took leave of one another, and went to our respective Quar|ters. A plague on the place; a Garret in <HI>Grub-street</HI> is one story high to it, and I was forc'd to rest three or four times before I could reach my Bed, which was nothing but a Quilt over some Rushes; and this the Son of a Whore my Landlord would have Eighteen-pence <HI>per</HI> Week for. I was forced to submit for a time, till I had provided all things for Travelling; and so I visited the several Counties of which the Reader may take the following Account.</P>
<P><HI>IRELAND</HI> (at present the <HI>Land of Ire,</HI> or Heavens Wrath) hath little in it, now, of <HI>God's Blessing,</HI> and never had very much of the <HI>warm Sun.</HI> It seems in the Opinion of some, to be part of the <HI>refuse</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> at the <HI>Creation,</HI> and that when the rest of <HI>Europe</HI> was compleated and polished, some of the <HI>scrap|ings</HI> and <HI>rubbish</HI> was cast out at this <HI>back-door,</HI> which being half dried by the squint|ing Beams of <HI>Sol,</HI> was in some measure <HI>dough-baked,</HI> into an <HI>Island,</HI> of what worth and quality shall be hereafter described.</P>
<P>If <HI>Europe</HI> be compared to a piece of fine <HI>Cloath,</HI> this must needs be some of the List, or Fagg-end: If to a stately <HI>Palace,</HI> this is the Postern: If to a humane Figure, where ever we place the <HI>Head,</HI> this will surely hold more proportion
<PB N="4" REF="6" MS="y">
and similitude with the <HI>Tail,</HI> as will appear upon farther Consideration.</P>
<P>Some formerly have thought fit to call it the <HI>Watering-Pot</HI> of the <HI>Planets</HI>; and the French have named it, <HI>Le Pot<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Chambre du Diable,</HI> i. e. <HI>the Devil's Piss-pot,</HI> seldom dry, but often running over, the Rains falling down so frequently, as if the Heavens were a wounded <HI>Eye,</HI> perpetually weeping over it it, or the Clouds dropping Spunges,</P>
<L>So fast it Rains, and so profusely pours</L>
<L>Heav'ns Liquid-Wrath in Elemental Show'rs,</L>
<L>That ev'n an Irish Doctor must disown</L>
<L>The Clouds Distemper there to be the Stone;</L>
<L>But rather with the common Emp'ricks hold,</L>
<L>Since they so drop at Nose, it is a Cold.</L>
<P>And then for the often Gusts of Wind, it may well be reck'ned, as <HI>Nature's Bellows</HI>; but for this, they may perhaps have reason to thank the <HI>Bantamites,</HI> who sowing so much <HI>Pepper</HI> yearly in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> in the Bowels of our Grand|mother <HI>Earth,</HI> it must needs cause her to break Wind backwards in these <HI>Western</HI> Parts, where she eases her self of the <HI>Collick:</HI> What Advantage they reap by it I know not, but the old Proverb says, <HI>It's an ill Wind blows no one any Good.</HI></P>
<P>Says one, It is a Frippery for Bankrupts, or the Grand Hospital for such as are troubled with a Consumption in their Estate and Credit. But whatever it were formerly, there is small hopes now that Strangers should be there cured of such desperate Diseases, since the whole Country may well pass for a Map of ge|neral Misery and Poverty, the Natives and Inhabitants being most of them the lively Portraitures of the Prodigal Lad in his most Swinish Condition; so that it were no less difficult now to get into an Estate there (unless by the Conquering Sword) then to get out of their deepest Bogs, when one is sinking, and can neither help ones self out, nor persuade <HI>Teague</HI> to assist, unless St. <HI>Patrick</HI> does prompt him in a most special manner.</P>
<P>Yet is the Soil in many Parts fat, and liking, (as Dunghils are) and were it well husbanded, would yield a plentiful Encrease; but what through Laziness, and want of Industry, (I speak of the meer Irish, to whom the whole Character re|lates) and their innate Pride, and Self-conceitedness, which make them disdain to be taught by Foreigners, they do so little Improve their Lands, that unless it be them|selves, nothing to an ingenious Eye can be a sadder Spectacle.</P>
<P>Inclosures are very rare amongst them, and those no better fenced than an old Midwife's toothless Gums, or those Parts of <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> where the Hedges were grubbed up by the Rebellious rout of the Commoners.</P>
<P>Much of their Land is reserved for Grazing and Pasturage; and there, in|deed, the Grass being very sweet, and holding a constant <HI>verdure,</HI> it is in many Places so indented with <HI>Purling Brooks</HI> and <HI>Streams,</HI> that their Meadows look like a new green Carpet border'd or fring'd with the purest <HI>Silver:</HI> Yet <HI>Hay</HI> is a Rarity amongst them, and would cost them more Pains than they can well afford, towards the making of it; therefore they seldom or never trouble their <HI>Heads</HI> or <HI>Hands</HI> about it. And then for their <HI>Arable</HI> Ground, it lies most com|monly as much neglected and unmanured as the sandy <HI>Desarts</HI> of <HI>Arabia,</HI> or a ranting Young <HI>Gallant</HI>'s Old Bed-rid <HI>Spouse.</HI> And, not to particularize every Circumstance, their National Custom of <HI>Ploughing,</HI> by tying their wooden Har|ness to the <HI>Horse's-Tail,</HI> and that other senseless Improvidence of <HI>burning</HI> their <HI>Oates</HI> to save the Labour of <HI>Thrashing,</HI> are two such very remarkable Proofs of their <HI>Husbandry,</HI> that it would be needless to describe it further: So that what|ever the <HI>Country</HI> be, they are a <HI>wild Herd of brute Animals</HI> inhabiting, but not im|proving it.</P>
<P>This <HI>Sloath</HI> and Carelessness is judged to be one Reason why all sorts of <HI>Grain-Fruits</HI> are of a less and more degenerate <HI>growth,</HI> than in other well <HI>Cultivated</HI> and <HI>Improved</HI> Countries (which is also noted in most of their <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals, Women</HI> and <HI>Grey-hounds</HI> only excepted) the Corn seldom shoots up to that aspir|ing height upon its Spindle, as may be seen elsewhere, nor does it attain so full and weighty an Ear as to make it bend down to kiss its <HI>Mothers Bosom</HI>; but grows
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y">
so dwarfish, thin, and full of Weeds, that it resembles the <HI>Field</HI> in the <HI>Parable,</HI> which the <HI>Evil</HI> One sowed with <HI>Tares.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Dwellings</HI> or <HI>Cabans,</HI> I should more exactly describe if I durst have adven|tured oftner into them; or could have staid long enough to have Survey'd them at my being there; which I did once <HI>Essay,</HI> but found it as hazardous almost, as <HI>Orpheus</HI> his descent into <HI>Hell,</HI> where there might be indeed a greater <HI>Fire,</HI> but not more <HI>Smoak,</HI> which thick <HI>Cloud</HI> in the midst of the Room did so <HI>blind me,</HI> and <HI>conceal</HI> the <HI>House,</HI> that I could scarce remember any thing, but my sore <HI>Eyes,</HI> when I came out <HI>again:</HI> Should they be as much troubled with that other <HI>noisom Disease</HI> of <HI>Scolding Wives,</HI> as they are with <HI>Smoaky Houses,</HI> they might well upon each <HI>Door</HI> write, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us,</HI> for certainly there cannot be a greater <HI>Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ge.</HI></P>
<P>As for the outward <HI>Structure,</HI> an <HI>English Cow house</HI> hath more <HI>Architecture</HI> far; nay, my <HI>Lord Mayor's Dog-kennel</HI> is a <HI>Palace</HI> compared to them: and for <HI>sweetness,</HI> I have heard many affirm, that the soulest Corner about the <HI>Bear-garden</HI> is <HI>Musk</HI> and <HI>Amber</HI> to their <HI>sweetest Rooms.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Walls</HI> are made of meer <HI>Mud,</HI> mixed with a little wet <HI>Straw,</HI> the Covering is <HI>Thatch</HI>; the Floor <HI>Earth</HI>; which, by reason of the constant Rains, is generally so damp, that they may be said to live over a <HI>Bog</HI>; and the <HI>Thatch</HI> so ill thrashed, that (by the sprouting of the left <HI>Corn,</HI> which often springs up green) it may be added, they live under a <HI>Meadow</HI>; or (as a Person of Honour said of the like place, to which he most aptly compared the <HI>Long, long Parliament</HI>) they have green <HI>Ears</HI> over their <HI>Heads,</HI> and a false <HI>Ground</HI> under their <HI>Feet.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Beds</HI> are upon such a firm Foundation, that nothing but an <HI>Earthquake</HI> can move them; Instead of <HI>Feathers</HI> or <HI>Flocks,</HI> they use <HI>Rushes</HI> or <HI>Straw,</HI> which serves them without changing, till cast <HI>Horse-litter</HI> is a fragrant <HI>Nosegay</HI> to it, and <HI>Iacob</HI>'s sweet Lodging on the <HI>fresh Grass,</HI> compared to it, is like the <HI>Pleasure</HI> of the <HI>Mar|riage-Bed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sheets</HI> they never provide, and to tell the <HI>naked Truth,</HI> unless they can purchase a poor <HI>Cadow,</HI> which is not often, they <HI>ligg</HI> together like <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> before the <HI>Fall,</HI> not a <HI>Rag</HI> to cover them, but themselves: Which may be one reason why they so multiply; for being necessitated to keep together for warmth, they in|gender as thick as <HI>Fly-blows,</HI> each little <HI>Hutt</HI> being as full of <HI>Children,</HI> as a <HI>Conney-Burrough</HI> in a well stock'd <HI>Warren</HI> is of Rabbits.</P>
<P>They seldom have any <HI>Partitions</HI> or several Rooms, but sleep in common with their <HI>Swine</HI> and <HI>Poultrey:</HI> and for second or third <HI>Story</HI> you may look long enough e're you find any. <HI>Windows</HI> would discover their <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Sluttery</HI> too much, and a <HI>Chimney</HI> is reckoned as <HI>superfluous</HI> as a <HI>Steeple</HI> at a new sangled <HI>Conventicle</HI>: The <HI>Door</HI> which perhaps is as irregular and multiform as a new made <HI>breach</HI> in a <HI>Wall,</HI> serving both to let in the <HI>Light,</HI> and let out the <HI>Smoak</HI>; so that you may guess their Abodes are pleasant and airy as a <HI>Dungeon,</HI> and unless they be compared to one another, each of them may very properly be called <HI>None-such.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Women</HI> generally are very little beholding to Nature for their <HI>Beauty,</HI> and less to <HI>Art</HI>: one may safely Swear they use no Painting, or such like <HI>auxiliary</HI> aids of <HI>Fucuses,</HI> being so averse to that kind of Curiosity, (tho' they have as much need thereof as any I ever yet beheld) that one would think they never had their faces <HI>wash'd</HI> but at their <HI>Baptism.</HI> To whom the perpetual <HI>Smoak</HI> within Doors, and want of a <HI>Bon-grace</HI> without, does add such a tincture of Complexion, that a Ploughman's Sun-burnt <HI>hand,</HI> or a Seaman's weather-beaten <HI>face,</HI> is <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Cream</HI> to it: So that one need not fear much temptation, they being, indeed, meer <HI>Scare-Crows,</HI> and their <HI>Phisiognomies</HI> such a defence, such a spell for their <HI>Plackets,</HI> such a refrigeratory 'against the flames of <HI>Lust,</HI> that in the <HI>Day-light</HI> they are secure from any violent attempt upon their <HI>Chastity,</HI> though in the <HI>Night</HI> they may pass <HI>Muster,</HI> and the push of <HI>Pike,</HI> when <HI>Ioan</HI> is as good as my <HI>Lady.</HI></P>

<P>I have heard it affirmed also, by knowing Persons in this Country, that in some Parts of it, they have a way of making a <HI>Soupe,</HI> beyond all the <HI>French Pot|tages</HI> in <HI>Vogue</HI>; the way is thus, A <HI>Dame</HI> of the better sort, having had the good Fortune to boil a piece of very fat <HI>Pork,</HI> till a great part of it is run into an <HI>Oil</HI> swimming on the top, she strips of her <HI>Smock,</HI> dips it therein till it has soaked up all the Grease; then puts it on her Body, and so wears it some days to <HI>smoothen</HI> her <HI>Skin,</HI> and supple her <HI>Ioints</HI>; now if afterwards there be occasion, and no store of other Provision about the <HI>Cabban,</HI> off comes this <HI>anointed</HI> Garment again, which being boiled in clear Water, and a little <HI>Oatmeal,</HI> and a small <HI>Faggot</HI> of Herbs; the melted Fat, and those other Ingredients will be converted into a most savoury Mess of <HI>Irish-Smock broath,</HI> and then 'tis done in a <HI>Dish.</HI></P>

<P>It is an Irish Observation (<HI>and a notable one too</HI>) that whenever two Armies meet in <HI>Battle,</HI> the one must <HI>run,</HI> for both cannot <HI>conquer,</HI> and since one must give <HI>way,</HI> why not at the <HI>beginning</HI> before much Bloodshed, rather than after too many lives are <HI>lost</HI>; and since one of them must, or generally does <HI>run,</HI> who fitter to <HI>run</HI> than they whom Nature has provided with better <HI>Legs</HI> to <HI>run,</HI> than <HI>Hands</HI> or <HI>Hearts</HI> to <HI>sight</HI>; therefore they do commonly <HI>run,</HI> and run betimes, lest some Wound in their Legs should hinder their <HI>nimble</HI> Retreat: This made an old experienc'd <HI>Of|ficer</HI> (who knew the way of the Reasoning of these Brutes) cause some <HI>Regiments</HI> of <HI>Dragoons</HI> to march on foot up towards their more numerous Army, with <HI>Boots</HI> on, whom when the Irish beheld, they straight-way concluded that those English Men being booted, would not, or could not <HI>run</HI>; and since one Party must go off at last, it must needs be themselves, and therefore they discreetly ran all away immediately.</P>
<P>A <HI>Stiff-necked</HI> Generation they cannot be called, they lay them down so readily to every <HI>Yoke,</HI> as if they were born to <HI>Servitude,</HI> and so we find them inclined to have been indifferently under their own <HI>Country-men,</HI> or under their old Friends the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in former Times, and their new Friends the <HI>French</HI> lately, if the English had not prevented it. Therefore are they the less to be <HI>pitied,</HI> because by them there is no greater Liberty <HI>expected,</HI> or much desired and struggled for by them.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Language</HI> seems to be very ancient indeed, being almost worn quite out of <HI>Date,</HI> scarce known in any other Country, and not generally used in their own: To a Foreigner it sounds so unpleasant, that it rather <HI>grates</HI> than <HI>tickles</HI> the <HI>Ear,</HI> and seems fitter to conjure than converse in. Withal, they use such a whining tone, and speak so precipitately, that considering their Garb and Po|sture, you would think they had been newly stript of their little All; and were now hastily and earnestly craving your Relief and Charity, for a fresh Supply.</P>
<P>Nor are they more Grave or Demure in their Pace; but frisk it about the Streets so Post-horse like, as if a Bailiff pursued them, or some fiercer Devil drove them.</P>
<P>Yet at their Work they are on the other hand, so <HI>slow</HI> and <HI>deliberate</HI> (Digging, Ploughing, Thrashing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with their Cloaks upon their Backs, and wasting so much of their time in <HI>Smoaking</HI> and <HI>Prating</HI>) that it is usual to hire Four of these <HI>Lubbers</HI> to dispatch the same daily Proportion of Work, as is performed by one Industrious <HI>English-hind</HI>; which would be very chargeable, did they not humbly submit to accept of much lesser Wages, which they take good care not to over-earn, lest they should surfeit themselves, or wear out their precious Limbs too

<P>Some Historians do speak them to be very tender and careful of their Young ones; but wherein that tenderness consists, is not readily to be found out. For their Food is not in the least degree better than they allow their Pigs, <HI>Bonny-rowre</HI> for the Summer, and <HI>Potato-roots</HI> in the Winter are their choicest Dainties: And then for their Cloathing, it is yet courser; of a whole Child the third part is scarce cover'd with Woollen; nor so much Linnen to be seen among a whole Tribe, as would make a Quaker's falling-band, or furnish an ordinary Box with Tinder, they being for the most part as naked as a young Ladies Neck in Dog-days, or the Bird in the Fable, stript of its borrowed Plumes; so that unless their Apish hugging them in their Arms, or carrying them on their Backs can make it out, I cannot.</P>
<P>But however careless they be of the <HI>Living,</HI> they are mightily concerned for the <HI>Dead,</HI> having a Custom, (which sure they borrowed from the <HI>Egyptians</HI>) of howling when they carry any one to Burial, and screaming over the Graves, not like other Christians, but like People without Hope; and sooner than this shall be omitted, they do hire a whole Herd of these Crocadiles to accompany the Corps, who with their counterfeit Tears and Sighs, and confused Clamour and Noise, do seem heartily to bemoan the departed Friend, though all this is with no more concern and reality, than an Actor on the Stage for the frighted Death of his Dearest in a Tragedy.</P>
<P>One Privilege, indeed, they have to boast of above most other Countries; which is, that they are free from Venomous Creatures (as <HI>England</HI> is from Ra|venous) which we may believe to be a Natural Antipathy, like that of the Islands <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Guernzey</HI>; Tho' they will needs attribute it to their Miracle-monger St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> who (as their Tradition goes) did one day summon them all together on the tod of an high and large Hill, called <HI>Cruich Phadrick,</HI> or St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s <HI>Mount</HI>; where having by irrisistible Conjuration assembled them, he, by his powerful Invocation called for Fire from Heaven, which came down, and consumed them: To which part of the Legend, some have added, That the great Croud of Irish Witnesses whom the good Saint had brought with him to see this Fear, and bear Testimony of it, finding he had so good interest and familiarity with God Almighty to obtain what he but asked for, desired him forthwith to make a second Petition, That Heaven would send down a plenti|ful Shower of Gold and Silver to Cure them of their Poverty, and make them as Opulent as the richest Nations: But he angerly replied, That God would work no Miracles to gratifie their Coveteousness; That he had already given them a large Country, which they were to Cultivate and Improve, and that their honest Labour would bring them in a sufficient Stock of Wealth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there|fore if they were not enough satisfied with this great Blessing so freely con|ferred, but continued to murmur, and tempt God too far, perhaps he might for their Unthankfulness and sordid Desires, turn it into a Curse again, to their perpetual Punishment. But they still importuning him, he at last made a se|cond Essay, not Petitioning for Gold or Silver, but that God would send down what he knew to be fittest for that Generation. Which Word he no sooner had pronounced, but there arose a great and furious Whirlwind, which blew and dispersed the Ashes of those Poisonous Creatures over all the whole Coun|try; and the same being forthwith converted all into Lice, they have for ever since continued a most Nasty and Lowzy Generation, and could never find a Cure, or remove this Epidemical, Egyptian Bosom-plague, so close it yet sticks to them.</P>

<P>A certain Portion of the County of <HI>Galloway</HI> is very well worth Observation; for in a Considerable extent thereof, Nature affords 'em neither Water enough to Drown 'em, Wood enough to Hang 'em, nor Earth enough to Bury 'em; yet 'tis very well Inhabited: Now what sort of Creatures, unless a Race of

<P>It is reported of the Germans, and some other War-like People, that when they come within sight and hearing of the Enemy, being drawn up in Battalia, and almost ready to Engage, they draw out their broad Sword, and each with a Whet-stone, they carry for that purpose, falls to work to set a keen Edge on his Weapon, with so much eagerness and noise, that it begets no little terrour in the listening Foe, and Proclaims with what undaunted Resolution they prepare to Assault them. Whereas the <HI>Teagues</HI> do only gaze about to see what Wood or Bog lies nearest, and can best shelter or favour them in their Re|treat, or, perhaps by greazing their Broags, or anointing their Joints, make ready for a more speedy Flight; then throwing down their Arms, and trusting solely to their Legs, dare not so much as once look back, but leave the Devil to take the hindmost.</P>

<P>WE have hitherto treated of the middle sort of People, and those who are to be found in the several Country Towns and Villages; but we are now come to a City, which is the cheif of the several Provinces, and the Capital in respect of the several Courts of Judicature which are held here, and where the supream Court of the whole Kingdom, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the high Court of Parliament is now assembled; but which notwithstanding the great Concourse of Nobility who now keep their Residence here, bears a proportion in its Inhabitants, to the People whose Manners in the foregoing Papers, we have submitted to the censure of the publick.</P>
<P><HI>Dublin</HI> is a City situated on an arm of the Sea, and might be made very strong, did those who are in the supream Power there think it advisable to make it so; it gives name to an Arch-Bishoprick, and is the place where the Deputies, or Lords-justices of <HI>Ireland</HI> hold their Court: At present their Excellencies the Lord Mar|quiss of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Gallaway</HI> have that Character, and if the In|habitants of this City had any disposition to Industry or Vertue, they might find such Encouragement from these Two noble Lords, as might sufficiently endear it to their Practice. But they are People not to be persuaded by Example or Precept, and if any of 'em are so lucky as to tread in the Paths of Goodness, you may conclude it wholy owing to themselves, for they are all too proud to follow one anothers directions.</P>

<P>The two principal Churches are St. <HI>Patricks,</HI> and <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> Edifices tole|rable enough, did not the Man in the Pulpit disgrace 'em; and unless Dr. <HI>King</HI> or some eminent Bishop transplanted from <HI>England</HI> Preaches there, you may as soon expect an ingenious Discourse from Dr. <HI>Meriton</HI> at St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the After|noon, or a piece of Oratory from the Mendicant Divine, who holds forth upon the rails in <HI>Moor-Feilds,</HI> as a sentence worth observation, from any Man of God among 'em all.</P>

<P>For the Nobility, the greatest Part of 'em may be compared to their own Mountains, who are so very high that they seem to wear the Stars for a Co|ronet, but yet are indeed no better <HI>dighted,</HI> then with a dirty Bog on the top, more deep and dangerous then the lowest Road in the Vallies.</P>
<P>Their Estates for the generality are not greater than an ordinary English Gentle|mans, yet their Pride so excessively great, that Disdain is written on their Brows, where you may read, <HI>I am too good for thee.</HI></P>
<P>For their Commonality, Writing is a rarity among 'em, and Reading would be utterly laid aside, were it not of great and important Consequence, when they are allow'd the Benefit of their Clergy in their Neck-Verse, and often-times poor <HI>Culprit</HI> goes to Pot, because Mr. Ordinary and He can't agree which reads truest.</P>
<P>But I have forgot the Right Honourable his Lordship, therefore I must tell you this pitiful City has its Lord Mayor too, who is at present much such another as that pious Gentleman who preceded Sir <HI>Francis Child</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> was; and tho' one would think that the better sort of Irish-mens Poverty might en|title 'em to beg, this venerable Magistrate will not permit the worser.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="10" MS="y">To conclude, this is a City powerful in its Privileges, but weak in its Exche|quer, empty in its Churches, but full in its Prisons; has very few Fortifications for its Security, yet has Cowards for its Inhabitants; the Nobility which live in it have Titles beyond their Estates, the Clergy Benefices beyond their Deserts, the Merchants great Houses beyond their Trade; and every House|keeper in it Promises beyond Performance. If this ben't enough to make me wish my self in <HI>England</HI> again, I am sufficient Proof for any Place whatsoever; and so much for the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which I shall describe no other|wise than it deserves, if I shall say it is,</P>
<L>A Land which does no <HI>Pois'nous</HI> Beast afford,</L>
<L>But in its Natives, with all <HI>Poisons</HI> stor'd:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Vice</HI> is fruitful and <HI>Sedition</HI> shoots</L>
<L>And shews its Head, from fix'd and lasting Roots;</L>
<L>Which often tempts the <HI>British</HI> Sword, and dares</L>
<L>The Fate of <HI>Caesar,</HI> who as often spares.</L>
<L>False to her Promise, Insolent, and Base,</L>
<L>Her <HI>Friends</HI> Dishonour, and her <HI>Own</HI> Disgrace;</L>
<L>Ready for <HI>Change,</HI> tho' not in <HI>Changes</HI> long,</L>
<L>Forsaking what is Right, embracing what is Wrong.</L>
<L>Conquer'd in Fight, Vnconquer'd in her Pride,</L>
<L><HI>Rescu'd,</HI> tho' never of the <HI>Rescuer</HI>'s Side.</L>
<L>But if Example may prevail, and gain</L>
<L>Repute, within a Land so False and Vain;</L>
<L>If <HI>Goodness</HI> may persuade, or <HI>Virtue</HI> Win</L>
<L>A People drown'd in <HI>Vice,</HI> and lost in <HI>Sin</HI>;</L>
<L>Ev'n she, has those who o're her Sons Preside,</L>
<L>Whose Lives can Teach her, and whose Precepts Guide;</L>
<L>Instructive in their Actions, as their Laws,</L>
<L>Iust to the People, and their Master's Cause.</L>
<L>And <HI>Winchester</HI> may yet retrieve her Name,</L>
<L>Tho' lost to Honour, and unknown to Fame;</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>She</HI> may practice what her <HI>Lord</HI> has done,</L>
<L>And follow <HI>England</HI>'s Virtues, in her <HI>Son.</HI></L>
