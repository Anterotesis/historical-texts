<OPENER><SALUTE>Kind Reader:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAd I opportunity but to borrow &s;ome of the Authors wit, 'tis po&s;|&s;ible I might &s;o trim this curious Work with &s;uch quaint expre&s;sions, as that the Preface might be&s;peake thy further peru|&s;all; but I feare 'twil be a &s;hame for a man that can &s;peak &s;o little, to be &s;eene in the title page of this Womans Book, le&s;t by comparing the one with the other, the Reader &s;hould pa&s;&s;e his &s;entence, that it is the gift of wo|men, not only to &s;peak mo&s;t, but to &s;peake be&s;t; I &s;hall leave therefore to commend that, which with any ingenious Reader will too much commend the Author, unle&s;se men turne more peevi&s;h then women, to envie the excellency of the in&s;eriour Sex. I doubt not but the Reader will quickly finde more then I can &s;ay, and the wor&s;t effect of his rea|ding will be unbeleif, which will make him que&s;tion whether it be a womans Work, and aske, Is it po&s;sible? If any doe, take this as an an&s;wer from him that dares avow it; It is the VVork of a VVoman, honoured, and e|&s;teemed
<PB REF="3">where &s;he lives, for her gracious de|meanour, her eminent parts, her pious con|ver&s;ation, her courteous di&s;po&s;ition, her exact diligence in her place, and di&s;creet mannag|ing of her family occa&s;ions; and more then &s;o, the&s;e Poems are the fruit but of &s;ome few houres, curtailed from her &s;leep, and other re|fre&s;hments. I dare adde little, le&s;t I keepe thee too long, if thou wilt not beleeve the worth of the&s;e things (in their kind) when a man &s;ayes it, yet beleeve it from a woman when thou &s;ee&s;t it. This only I &s;hall annex, I feare the di&s;plea&s;ure of no per&s;on in the pub|li&s;hing of the&s;e Poems but the Authors, without who&s;e knowledge, and contrary to her expe|ctation, I have pre&s;umed to bring to publick view what &s;he re&s;olved &s;hould never in &s;uch a manner &s;ee the Sun; but I found that di|vers had gotten &s;ome &s;cattered papers, affe|cted them wel, were likely to have &s;ent forth broken peices to the Authors prejudice, which I thought to prevent, as well as to plea&s;ure tho&s;e that earne&s;tly de&s;ired the view of the whole.</P>
