<HEAD>A true Relation of what pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_AS the evill carriage of the <HI>Sultan Hibraim,</HI> Empe|rour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> had of long time alienated from him the hearts of the mo&s;t parts of his Subjects, and chiefly of his Militia, not accu|&s;tomed to endure: So their di&s;contents being come to a greater height by extraordinary op|pre&s;&s;ions, this Militia re&s;olved to free them&s;elves from them, by making away the fir&s;t <HI>Vizier,</HI> and by depo&s;ing of the grand <HI>Seigniour</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And to the &s;ame intent they gathered together on Friday the 7th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t hard by the <HI>Mosky</HI> of <HI>Sultan Mehemet,</HI> and &s;ent for the <HI>Mophty,</HI> together with the <HI>Cadileskiers;</HI> one of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> the other of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the Lawyers.</P>
<P>The Grand <HI>Seigniour</HI> having warning of what pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ent &s;ome to &s;peake in his name to the &s;ouldiers and their Officers, to de&s;ire them to di&s;per&s;e quietly, with promi&s;es they &s;hould receive full &s;atisfaction. He did &s;end al&s;o to the <HI>Mophty,</HI> to entreate him to quiet the mutiny: But the Militia an&s;wered, That they were gathered to remedy many things which they found to be ami&s;&s;e in the Government: And the <HI>Mophty</HI> &s;aid, that being &s;ent for by the Militia, he had been forced to obey them; That he would doe his be&s;t endeavour to hinder di&s;or|ders; but that he was forced to declare to the Grand <HI>Seigniour,</HI> that the Militia would not &s;uffer <HI>Acemet Ba&s;ha,</HI> the Great <HI>Vizier,</HI> to enjoy his place any longer, and de&s;ired the &s;ame office to be be&s;towed upon <HI>Mehemet Ba&s;ha,</HI> who was an old man of &s;eventy
<PB N="2" REF="3">yeares of age, retired from the world, and from all em|ployment.</P>
<P>The &s;ame an&s;wer being brought by the Grand <HI>Seigniour,</HI> he &s;ent pre&s;ently word to the <HI>Mophty,</HI> that he was well plea&s;ed to make the &s;aid <HI>Mehemet Ba&s;ha</HI> Great <HI>Vizier,</HI> and thereupon that old man was &s;ent to his Highne&s;&s;e, who &s;pake to him roughly, asking him who had &s;ent him, and objecting that he was not capable of that employment, and notwith&s;tanding gave him the <HI>Bull,</HI> which is the chiefe token of that dignity.</P>
<P>There was nothing more done that day, except that the old <HI>Vizier,</HI> who had fled from his owne hou&s;e to that of one of his kindred, re&s;olved upon the evening of the &s;ame day, to go and ca&s;t him&s;elfe to the mercy of the new <HI>Vizier,</HI> as well becau&s;e he thought him to be one of his friends, as thinking by that fained confidence to engage him to &s;hew him &s;ome mercy, and &s;ave his life: But the Militia hearing from the &s;aid new <HI>Vizier,</HI> that he had the accur&s;ed man in his owne power; &s;ent &s;ome &s;ouldi|ers to tell him, that he &s;hould make him away; and &s;o he was &s;trangled at that time, and his body expo&s;ed in the great place of the new <HI>Mosky,</HI> which is not farre from the <HI>Serralia</HI> of the Grand <HI>Seigniour.</HI></P>
<P>The next day about eight of the clock in the morning, the Militia gathered in the &s;aid great place, to the number often or twelve thou&s;ands; the <HI>Janizaries</HI> being armed with &s;words and guns, and the <HI>Spatries</HI> with &s;words only. The chiefe&s;t of them, and the Officers went into the <HI>Mosky,</HI> where al&s;o came pre&s;ently after the <HI>Mophty Napguiq,</HI> who is the chiefe of tho&s;e, who are &s;aid to be de&s;cended from the pretended Prophet, MAHOMET, The <HI>Cadileskyers</HI> and other Lawyers: Among&s;t whom one of the <HI>Cadileskyers,</HI> who is he of <HI>Romelye,</HI> pre&s;uming to get into the <HI>Mosky,</HI> as the others after the <HI>Mophty,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Mophty</HI> turning him&s;elfe backe had &s;carce ended the&s;e words, <HI>This is none of ours,</HI> that being heard by &s;ome of the <HI>Ja|nizaries,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">they fell in&s;tantly upon that <HI>Cadileskyer,</HI> and hackt him all into pieces: which gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome to believe, that this con&s;piration was fore-thought of, and agreed upon by &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t, and not only contrived by the Militia.</P>
<P>This execution having nothing &s;lackened the fir&s;t de&s;igne, being met together in the <HI>Mosky,</HI> an Officer of the <HI>Spatries</HI> &s;pake fir&s;t, and &s;aid to the <HI>Mophty,</HI> that the Militia was come there together to complain again&s;t the Grand <HI>Seigniour,</HI> and to remedy the pre&s;ent abu&s;es.</P>
<P>To which the <HI>Mophty</HI> an&s;wered, that it was fit to hear what the Grand <HI>Seigniour</HI> would &s;ay in his owne defence. Therefore they &s;ent for him to appeare before the ju&s;tice of God, and to an&s;wer to the complaints of the Militia: That word of ju&s;tice of God being an epithet which the Turks give to their Law, called, <HI>Cher-alla.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mophty Nupguiq</HI> was then deputed with two Lawyers to bring him that word: But his Highne&s;&s;e having heard them, gave an&s;wer, that he would not goe to ju&s;tice; and if they had any thing to complaine of again&s;t him, they &s;hould come to him; that he would hear his Militia, and give them &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>That an&s;wer being brought to the A&s;&s;embly and the <HI>Moph|ty,</HI> being con&s;ulted, &s;aid, that to omit nothing of the formali|ties, they &s;hould make a <HI>Fetfu,</HI> (which is a kind of judgement which the <HI>Mophty</HI> pronounceth, when he is con&s;ulted about any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e) by which it &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted, that any one who is called before the ju&s;tice of God, is bound to appeare there; and that the Grand <HI>Seigniour</HI> him&s;elf is not free from that Law. The <HI>Fitfu</HI> was pre&s;ently made, and in&s;tead of &s;ending any Lawyers to denounce it, as it was done by the former deliberation, they did choo&s;e a <HI>Spatry</HI> and a <HI>Janizary</HI> of the mo&s;t ancient that were in their places, but of no g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">at concernment.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e two rid upon hor&s;es, one of them holding the <HI>Fetfu</HI> very high, that the Militia might &s;ee it; and came
<PB N="4" REF="4">to the Grand <HI>Seigniour,</HI> to whom they delivered their writing; which his Highne&s;&s;e having read, he tore it in pieces, adding, That he would never goe before the Ju&s;tice; that they &s;hould doe their utmo&s;t, he was not afraid of any thing: But if his Militia would depute &s;ome Officers to &s;peake with him, they &s;hould have audience.</P>
<P>The two Souldiers having acquainted the A&s;&s;embly with that an&s;wer, the <HI>Mophty</HI> was urged to declare what a man doth de&s;erve, who will not obey ju&s;tice; and &s;aid, that any one which doth not obey the ju&s;tice of God, is no true <HI>Mu&s;ulman;</HI> his wife is no more his wife; and if he is an Emperour, hee doth forfeit his Office, and the right he had to the Crowne.</P>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>Mophty</HI> made pre&s;ently a &s;econd <HI>Fetfu</HI> of this te|nour; and the &s;ame two Souldiers were &s;ent with it to pro|claime it to the Grand <HI>Seigniour,</HI> who after the reading of it, did with it as before, tearing it, with threatnings, that he would one day avenge him&s;elfe of tho&s;e factious men: Which words being related, the <HI>Mophty,</HI> the Lawyers and Officers of the Mi|litia did re&s;olve to goe them&s;elves to the <HI>Seralia,</HI> and declare to the Grand <HI>Seigniour,</HI> that he was no more Emperour, and to take the elde&s;t of his children, called <HI>Sultan Mehemet,</HI> &s;et him upon his Throne, and proclaime him Emperour. They went then from the <HI>Moskey</HI> about five a clocke in the evening, fol|lowed by the <HI>Janizaries</HI> and <HI>Spatris,</HI> came to the <HI>Seralia,</HI> at the Gate leading to the Grand <HI>Seigniours</HI> lodging: And it is &s;aid, that then his Highne&s;&s;e, who was re&s;olved to &s;hew him&s;elfe to them, and to reprove them roughly, &s;eeing &s;o great a number of Souldiers, fainted in his heart, and intreated to <HI>Valida,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Mother <HI>Sultane,</HI> to helpe him out of that danger, endeavouring to quiet the mutiny: She promi&s;ed him to doe her be&s;t, and having per&s;wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">d him to withdraw into a cham|ber, &s;he lockt him in, and tooke the key with her, and went to the <HI>Mophty</HI> and the Officers of the Militia, to enquire why they
<PB N="5" REF="4">came in that manner to the <HI>Seralia</HI> with armed men, contrary to the re&s;pect and honour due to the Gate of the Grand <HI>Seigniour.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mophty</HI> advancing towards her, told her, that the Mili|tia having great complaints to make again&s;t <HI>Sultan Hibraim,</HI> had called him before the Ju&s;tice; the which having not obey|ed, he had made him&s;elfe unworthy of the Crowne, and that the Militia would have the <HI>Sultan Mehemet</HI> delivered to them, to proclaime him Emperour. The Prince&s;&s;e endeavoured to per&s;wade him, that they had no ground to take away the Crowne from her Sonne; and that if there had been any thing ami&s;&s;e in the Government, it was done by the <HI>Vizier,</HI> who had abu&s;ed his Ma&s;ters authority, and that he had beene ju&s;tly pu|ni&s;hed for it, entreating them that they would proceed no fur|ther, but leave her Sonne in his Throne, promi&s;ing, that all the abu&s;es &s;hould be reformed, and if her Sonne had before that time failed in any thing, he would mend for the future.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mophty</HI> an&s;wered, that all tho&s;e excu&s;es were needle&s;&s;e, and declared that the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was fully re&s;olved; and if the <HI>Sultan Mehemet</HI> was not &s;ent pre&s;ently to him, they would fetch him by force out of the <HI>Seralia:</HI> which forced at la&s;t the &s;aid Prince&s;&s;e to bring out the young Prince, and pre&s;ent him before the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>It was pre&s;ently commanded that the Imperiall Seat &s;hould be brought, with a <HI>Turban</HI> trimmed, with &s;ome hens fea|thers, which is in&s;tead of a Crowne among&s;t the <HI>Ottomans</HI> Em|perours; Afterward the young Prince (being but &s;even years of age) was &s;et upon the Throne, and the Imperiall <HI>Turban</HI> up|on his head, and &s;o was proclaimed Emperour.</P>
<P>The whole Militia being in the Courts of the <HI>Seralia,</HI> and there-about, cryed pre&s;ently, GOD SAVE SVL|TAN MEHEMET: Which being done, every one went home; And the 9th of the &s;aid month <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t,
<PB N="6" REF="5">the conclu&s;ion of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was, That the New <HI>Vizier,</HI> and the Officers of the Militia, with a great number of <HI>Janizaries</HI> and <HI>Spatris</HI> came backe againe to the <HI>Seralia,</HI> where they con|fined the unhappy <HI>Sultan Hibraim</HI> to a chamber; which is the &s;ame pri&s;on where he hath been kept many years in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Amurat;</HI> and they charged the <HI>Bou&s;tangy Bachy,</HI> who hath the guard of the <HI>Seralia,</HI> and doth command to all the <HI>Bou&s;tangis,</HI> with the keeping of his per&s;on there.</P>
