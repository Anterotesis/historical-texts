<P>_THou ha&s;t here, cour|teous Reader, pre|&s;ented to thee a ge|nerall view of tho&s;e remote, but rich and goodly parts of the World, to which the Hand of Divine Providence &s;eemeth at this time to be lea|ding the Engli&s;h Nation, for the execution of tho&s;e things, which his Divine Ju&s;tice and

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Globe of the Earth in generall, and of the generall parts which it containeth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. _GOD Almighty, the great and wi&s;e Architect of the Univer&s;e, having by his Divine Power and Wi&s;dome, rai&s;ed out of Nothing this &s;tately Fa|brique of the World, and a&s;&s;igned unto all things their peculiar Place, Order, and Situ|ation therein, as was mo&s;t agreeable to their particular natures, operations, and properties; the Earth, being the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t materiate of all created Sub&s;tances, by the Creators eter|nall Order and Decree, and its own naturall propen&s;ity, &s;unk into the lowe&s;t place of all Things, and that which was mo&s;t di&s;tant from the Heavens, <HI>viz.</HI> into the Center or middle part of the World, becomming a Ba&s;is, as it were, and Foundation of &s;upport unto all o|ther
<PB N="2" REF="11">
elementary Sub&s;tances or Bodies, as upon which either mediatly or immediatly they doe all re&s;t and are &s;u&s;tained in their motions and operations; it &s;elf (&s;peaking of the whole Bo|dy or Ma&s;s of it) for ever immoveably re&s;ting upon its own weight, that is to &s;ay, upon the mo&s;t naturall property of its own Sub&s;tance; which being (as we &s;ee by experience in every particular part thereof) irre&s;i&s;tably and direct|ly <HI>to move downward,</HI> that is, from the Heavens, and toward the Center; it follows, that the Globe of the Earth being round (as both Scripture, Philo&s;ophie, and experience doe de|mon&s;trate it to be) it mu&s;t needs follow, I &s;ay, that all and every the parts of this round Body, de&s;cending &s;o naturally and irre&s;i&s;tibly, as they doe, from all parts of the Circumference equally to the Center, that the whole Earth mu&s;t naturally re&s;t or &s;tand immovable in the mid&s;t of the World, or in the middle part of the Circumference of the Heavens, neither mo|ving nor inclining one way or other, in re&s;pect of the &s;aid Circumference or cele&s;tial Sphere; becau&s;e, as 'tis evident, the inclination which any particular part of it may have, or be &s;up|po&s;ed to have, to move this way or that: For example, North or South is equally re&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome other part who&s;e inclination is oppo&s;ite,

and tends as naturally Ea&s;t and We&s;t. This the Scripture <HI>P&s;alm.</HI> 104, according to the origi|nal, calleth the founding or e&s;tabli&s;hing of the Earth <HI>upon its own Ba&s;e,</HI> or as the common La|tin tran&s;lations read it <HI>&s;uper &s;tabilitatem &s;uam,</HI> meaning &s;uch a Foundation or Settlement as a|ri&s;eth out of the Principles and natural Proper|ties of its own Sub&s;tance, &amp; not from any thing extrin&s;ecal to it; and may be illu&s;trated to &s;en&s;e by this familiar example: Let A, B, C, D, be
<FIGURE>

the four quarters of a Circumference or Sphere, and E the Center or middle. Let there be four bullets, of pa&s;te or any other Sub|&s;tance, who&s;e parts are apt to joyn and unite together into one figure. Let them be di&s;charg|ed at the &s;ame time from the four quarters of the Circumference, <HI>viz.</HI> from A, B, C, D, out
<PB N="4" REF="12">
of four Cannons or Mu&s;quets, of equall bore and &s;trength, directly, or in a right line to|wards the Center, or E, where will they meet but exactly in or about E, the Center? and where will they re&s;t but there likewi&s;e, in ca&s;e that E, or the Center, be the naturall place of them, and that they have no intrin&s;ecal princi|ple and inclination in them&s;elves to recede from thence? In like manner it is with the Earth. All the parts of it did, at the beginning and fir&s;t creation of things by God, and &s;till doe, naturally and directly tend, not onely from the four quarters, but from all and every imaginable part of the Circumference of the Heavens, to the Center or middle part of the World; and con&s;equently their meeting (be|cau&s;e it is their proper and naturall place, and from which they cannot of them&s;elves, never &s;o little, recede or decline) mu&s;t there, and about it eternally re&s;t: I &s;ay mu&s;t there eter|nally re&s;t and remain &s;etled or &s;till, without motion or inclination to move one way or other, untill wee doe a&s;&s;igne &s;ome extrin&s;e|cal Agent or Cau&s;e, &s;o much &s;uperior in force to their naturall inclination, as to be able to di&s;lodg them and make them &s;tir; which that it &s;hould be the <HI>levant windes,</HI> as &s;ome ima|gine, truly &s;eems to me a conceit lighter than
<PB N="5" REF="12">
the winde, and much unworthy of the judge|ment of him that, I think, fir&s;t publi&s;hed it to the World: That &s;uch a &s;oft and moderate gale, as tho&s;e windes of them&s;elves alwaies are, not &s;ufficient to remove a &s;tone of a pound weight, if it lay in their way, and many times not able to drive a Ship before it, with all the advantage of Sails, cour&s;e of Waters, &amp;c. that can be given it: (for it is no &s;trange thing at Sea, to heare that Ships are, now and then, be|calmed, and want winde upon the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and within the Tropiques.) I &s;ay, that &s;uch a moderate gale, as tho&s;e windes are, &s;hould be able to work &s;uch an effect again&s;t &s;uch an in|finite re&s;i&s;tance as is in the whole body of the Earth, what man of common &s;en&s;e can beleeve it?</P>
<P N="2">2. This therefore being a demon&s;tration for the &s;tability and unmovable fixedne&s;s of the Earth in the middle of the World, of &s;uch evident, obvious, and unrevincible experience as it is; Me thinks it cannot be &s;ufficiently wondred at, why the World &s;hould &s;eem &s;o generally and &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly to be taken with the Eccentrick and injudicious fancies of <HI>Coperni|cus</HI> and <HI>Galilaeus,</HI> concerning the perpetual mo|tion which they imagine to be in the Earth, and that the Heavens or cele&s;tial Bodies &s;tand &s;till
<PB N="6" REF="13">
and move not at all. Fancies, not only contrary to common &s;en&s;e (&s;o farre as &s;en&s;e may be judge of the motion, re&s;t, di&s;tance, and &s;itua|tion of Bodies, which certainly it may and ought to be in many ca&s;es, and &s;uch as doe par|ticularly pertain to this que&s;tion) contrary to the more generall and unanimous judgement of both ancient and modern Philo&s;ophers, con|trary to the evidence of &s;o many thou&s;and de|mon&s;trations Mathematicall and A&s;tronomi|call, which have been founded and held good in all ages, upon the contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Earth is the Center of the Univer&s;e; and that, <HI>&s;ecundum &s;e totam,</HI> it never moveth; but contrary al&s;o unto Scripture, which refutes the opinion in a hundred places, reckoning the perpetuall motion of the Heavens, and the un|movable re&s;t and &s;tability of the Earth, among the <HI>Magnalia Dei,</HI> or the chief works of Divine Providence and Wi&s;dome. The places are &s;o obvious and frequent, that it &s;eems &s;carce ne|ce&s;&s;ary to alledge them; yet the reader, if he plea&s;e, may &s;ee <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.5, 6. and 104.19, 20. <HI>Jo&s;.</HI> 10.12, 13. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 20.9, 10, 11. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 104.5. and 119.90. <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 1.5. which la&s;t is the te&s;timony of <HI>Solomon</HI> him&s;elf, not only a great King, but as the Scriptures likewi&s;e te&s;tify of him 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 4.29, 30, 31, 32, 33. a great Phi|lo&s;opher,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
and one that under&s;tood the nature and con&s;titution of the World better than any meere Philo&s;opher before him, or &s;ince; which I &s;uppo&s;e no man will be &s;o immode&s;t as to de|ny. And though we acknowledge the Scrip|tures were not given principally to teach us a body of Naturall Philo&s;ophy, as they frequent|ly tell us; yet doubtle&s;s they were given to teach us truth, in what&s;oever they teach us, and how to judge of the works of God, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e great and more generall parts of the Creation, which, by their obviou&s;ne&s;s and vi|&s;ibility, were to be the &s;ubject of every mans pious meditation and wonder: Neither can we but pre&s;ume, with &s;ome confidence, that the Author of Scripture under&s;tood the frame and con&s;titution of his own handiwork &s;omewhat better than <HI>Copernicus</HI> or <HI>Des Cartes;</HI> and would, without all doubt, have made another manner of report of it, if the truth had been otherwi&s;e, or that it had been his divine plea|&s;ure, that we &s;hould have otherwi&s;e judged of it. Admit therefore, that the Scripture <HI>&s;ome|times</HI> doth not &s;peak &s;o exactly of the Natures of things, but <HI>more hominum,</HI> as they &s;ay, and by way of <HI>accomodation,</HI> or fitting it &s;elf to the common judgment and apprehen&s;ion of men, and con&s;equently that it ought not to be al|ledged
<PB N="8" REF="14">
in que&s;tions <HI>purely philo&s;ophicall,</HI> con|trary to the evidence of naturall rea&s;on and demon&s;tration; yet certainly, where the te&s;ti|mony of Scripture is &s;o frequent and empha|tically a&s;&s;ertive, as it is in many re&s;pects here, and when the &s;tile thereof is not contrary unto, but con&s;onant to the generall properties and principles of Nature (by which even philo&s;o|phically we are to judge, and in other ca&s;es perpetually doe judge of Naturall things) if then we vouch&s;afe not both to &s;peak and think according to the language of Scripture, we &s;eem to bear but little re&s;pect to Scripture; and though the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;tile</HI> of a writing be not al|waies the one and &s;ame thing, yet in &s;uch ca&s;e it mu&s;t not be every plau&s;ible imagination or phanta&s;m that may po&s;&s;ibly com in our mindes, but very nece&s;&s;ary, cogent, and undeniable de|mon&s;tration indeed, that &s;hould induce us to dogmatize in any thing contrary to the autho|rity of the &s;acred &s;tile. But who ever &s;aw any thing alledged by the Carte&s;ians of this na|ture? What nece&s;&s;ary, cleer, and evident de|mon&s;trations doe they propound, either again&s;t the motion of the Heavens, or for the motion of the Earth? what objections doe they make, but learned men of the contrary opinion, doe as ea&s;ily demon&s;trate to be fallacious and &s;o|phi&s;ticall,
<PB N="9" REF="14">
and more ea&s;ily an&s;wer than they &s;eem to make them? Nay, for my part, 'tis more than I can yet ob&s;erve, that they doe much pretend unto any &s;uch matter, <HI>viz.</HI> as to demon&s;trate either the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of their own &s;y&s;tem of the World, or the <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> and incon&s;i&s;tency of the Ptolemaick or common Sy&s;tem, with the principles of Nature and Rea&s;on&punc; All that they labour about is rather to &s;hew the po&s;&s;ibility of their own devi&s;e, and to reconcile the <HI>Phoenomena</HI> or apparences of Heaven, and make them con&s;i&s;tent wirh the motion of the Earth: which though they were better able to doe, then I &s;uppo&s;e they are, yet would it not follow, but that the other is like|wi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible and con&s;i&s;tent; and having the advantage of divine te&s;timony and atte&s;tation be&s;ide, con&s;equently it would but little ju&s;tify &s;ome of them to dogmatize &s;o freely in the point as they doe, contrary to the &s;tile of &s;acred Scripture, and likewi&s;e to the judgement of &s;ome Eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, that ought not to be &s;lighted, before which <HI>Galilaeus</HI> him&s;elf was twice convinced of his error, and twice re|canted his opinion.

<P N="5">5. That which compleateth the Globe, and maketh the body of the Earth more entirely round, is the Element of Waters; which is a Sub&s;tance compounded, as it were, and con&s;i|&s;ting of Earth and Aire mixed together, yet in &s;uch a proportion, as that the Sub&s;tance of the Earth doth much predominate in the compo|&s;ition. From hence it followeth, that the ele|ment of Water mu&s;t retain the naturall pro|pertie of the Earth, which is, to <HI>move down|ward</HI> in a direct line toward the Center of the World, as we &s;ee perpetually that it doth in every little drop of water, which divides the Aire, and makes it &s;elf a direct pa&s;&s;age through
<PB N="18" REF="19">
it towards the Earth and Center of the World; and likewi&s;e it mu&s;t retain (though in a weaker and le&s;&s;er degree) the propertie of the Aire, which is to be diffufive and perpetually &s;prea|ding it &s;elf, and unapt to be kept together but by &s;ome extrin&s;ecal boundary or body that contains it. From the fir&s;t of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the predominancy and propertie of the Earth in the Element of Water, it follows that the Wa|ter mu&s;t naturally cleave to the Earth, be na|turally united with it, and hardly, that is, not otherwi&s;e than by force &s;eparated from it. So that there is no feare that the waters of the lower Hermi-&s;phere, or of the Antipodes, &s;hould fall back into the concave of the Hea|vens, as, upon our fir&s;t thoughts of it, we are commonly apt to imagine; nor yet that any of the People or other living Creatures in that part of the World, &s;hould have the like mi&s;|chance. For, upon what&s;oever part of the <HI>Su|perficies</HI> or Surface of the Earth they live and move, they are fa&s;tened and glued, as I may &s;ay, to it by this natural &amp; inbred propertie of the Earth, which is predominant in their con&s;tituti|on, <HI>viz.</HI> to move downward, and incline to the Center, and which we &s;ee perpetually takes place in them, when&s;oever their animal and vo|luntary motions cea&s;e. From the &s;econd, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="19">
its natural fluxilitie and diffu&s;ivene&s;s it fol|lows, that the water mu&s;t be apt to in&s;inuate and lodg it &s;elf in all &s;uch cavities and recep|tacles, whether upon the Surface or more within the bowels of the Earth, as the divine Providence hath prepared for it: and al&s;o that where&s;oever it findeth a free pa&s;&s;age, or chan|nel, and that it is not &s;topt or kept in with banks or bounds, it &s;hould be naturally and continually flowing or in motion, as the Aire is: And from both it appears, how apt the wa|ter of it &s;elf is to imbrace the Earth on all parts, and to con&s;titute one common Globe or round Body with it. The Carte&s;ians, men of &s;uch di&s;cerning and &s;earching capacities as they are, me thinks, if they would, might more ea|&s;ily finde &s;ome probable rea&s;on from hence, of that notable effect in Nature, which hath &s;o long exerci&s;ed their Speculations, <HI>viz.</HI> of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, without being driven to a nece&s;&s;ity of un&s;etling and &s;haking the foundation of all things, which the wi&s;dom of God hath &s;o cleerely laid in and upon the Earth; and without perverting the glorious and never &s;ufficiently to be admired Sy&s;tem and Frame of the World, with &s;uch pre&s;umption as they doe. Without doubt the influence of the cele&s;tial Bodies doe much concur to this
<PB N="20" REF="20">
effect, by their attenuating and rarefying the &s;ub&s;tance of that Element; and likewi&s;e the Windes, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are natural and con&s;tant to the re&s;pective Climates of the World: Nor doe I think it an effect, that can be attributed unto any particular, uniform, or &s;ingle cau&s;e what&s;oever; &s;o as they that &s;tretch their wits, and labor to attribute it to any &s;uch cau&s;e, I fear labour in vain. But yet, under fa|vour, and with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to better judge|ment, I &s;uppo&s;e the principal and more gene|ral cau&s;e, which di&s;po&s;eth the element of the Waters to &s;uch an effect, may be that very thing or quality which we are now di&s;cour&s;ing upon, <HI>viz.</HI> its natural fluxility and aptne&s;s to be perpetually running and in motion, where it hath a convenient channel wherein to flow, and wherby to empty it &s;elf into another place. For, as we &s;aid, naturally it is incon&s;i&s;tent in or with it &s;elf alone; nor is there any other cau&s;e required to make it move or flow, but onely a way open and plain: So that if it were certain (as I think mo&s;t Co&s;mographers hold it for very probable) that there were a channel at the North for the waters of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or the we&s;tern Ocean, to pa&s;s into the Atlan|tick, as there is at the South for the waters of the Atlantick to pa&s;s into <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> I
<PB N="21" REF="20">
&s;hould think without any more adoe, that what we call the Tyde, that is, the excre&s;cency of the waters in narrow Seas, Creeks and Rivers nigh the Sea (for in the main Ocean 'tis com|monly &s;aid there is little or noe Tyde ob&s;er|ved) were nothing el&s;e but an effect of that great and general flood, by which the waters of one Hemi&s;phere doe continually flow in|to the other, according to the cour&s;e and mo|tion of the &s;uperior World, from which, be|&s;ide their natural proclivity and aptne&s;s unto motion they doe con&s;tantly receive an acce&s;&s;o|ry influence and impre&s;&s;ion to move; and which general flood, or cour&s;e of the Waters out of one Hemi&s;phere into another, as it pa&s;|&s;eth along the &s;everal coa&s;ts of the World, ne|ce&s;&s;arily putteth in aboundance of waters into all narrow Seas, Creeks, and other receptacles lying conveniently to receive it: and that the Ebbe is nothing el&s;e but the rece&s;s of the &s;ame Waters, retiring and withdrawing them&s;elves (as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily doe) to follow the general flood, when it is gone by. But becau&s;e this pa&s;&s;age or entercour&s;e of the Waters of the upper and lower Hemi&s;phere, by the North, is not to me &s;o evident, I leave the whole matter as a Problem, and Subject of further meditation to tho&s;e that are willing to

In their no|&s;trils and upon their lips &s;ome of them had rings of gold pendant, as it were, in the way of ornament; which the Spaniards quickly e&s;pied: and inquiring of them by &s;ignes, where they had &s;uch fine things, they came to under|&s;tand, that a certain King of that Country, who lived a great way further toward the South, had aboundance of it. This news plea&s;ed them &s;o well, that they made no long &s;tay there, but on the 15^t^h of <HI>October</HI> they &s;et Sail, and fell upon another of tho&s;e I&s;lands &s;even or eight leagues di&s;tant from this, which they called <HI>la Conception;</HI> from thence upon the 17^t^h they came to the I&s;land <HI>Fernandina;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cuba: Columbus</HI> not &s;uffering his men in any of the&s;e places, to take ought from the Natives again&s;t their will, or without gi|ving them &s;omething for it, which they &s;eemed to de&s;ire. At <HI>Cuba</HI> he found that the Natives had &s;ome Towns and Villages, which they in|habited, and were &s;o ordered, that in fifty or three&s;core hou&s;es &s;ometimes 2000 or 1500 people of Men, Women, and Children, were contained, according to the cu&s;tome of the Country, that all People of the &s;ame Linage or Kindred lived together in one hou&s;e: and their

From hence they &s;ailed to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where they had &s;ight of the King of the Coun|try, named <HI>Guacanagari,</HI> who received him and his company with much &s;hew of kinde|ne&s;s, pre&s;enting him with the Fruits and other Commodities of the Country; and, which was better than all the re&s;t, giving them more cer|tain information of tho&s;e golden Provinces, which were afterwards di&s;covered in the main Land; for as yet they were but upon I&s;lands, and had not touched or &s;een any part of the Continent of <HI>America. Columbus</HI> was &s;o well &s;atisfied with the intelligence which he had gained, that he re&s;olved to return for <HI>Spain,</HI> and to make report of his Adventures to the King; whereunto the condition of his Ships, want of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions to proceed further, together with &s;ome other accidents, did al&s;o induce him. For, as it commonly hap|pens in the affairs of this World, unanimity and friend&s;hip la&s;teth not long among men, e&s;pecially where &s;elf-love and private intere&s;t once make a breach, his Vice-Admiral <HI>Pincon,</HI> perceiving the voyage likely to be profitable,

had by this time &s;eparated him&s;elf from <HI>Co|lumbus,</HI> upon pretence of &s;ome offence taken, but really out of hopes to advance his Fortunes better by going apart by him&s;elf; which, though it were derogatorie to his Commi&s;&s;ion and the command which he had over him, as Admirall, yet <HI>Columbus</HI> was content to beare with it, for the better carrying on of their com|mon de&s;ign; &s;o they were reconciled: And having built the Fort of <HI>Natividad</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;pa|niola,</HI> for the guard of &s;ome Spaniards that were to be left there, <HI>Columbus</HI> &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Spain</HI> on Friday the fourth of <HI>January,</HI> having fir&s;t charged his men to &s;hew all due re&s;pect to the King of the Country, and not to wrong the Natives. But how they did ob&s;erve his charge, doth not &s;o well appear; For the men are &s;aid to be murder'd, all of them, by the Na|tives, during the ab&s;ence of <HI>Columbus:</HI> and this is thought to have been &s;ome occa&s;ion, not onely of the Warre, which the Spaniards made afterwards upon the Natives, but of that ex|ce&s;&s;ive &s;everity and cruelty, which for a long time together they u&s;ed towards them. In his return he di&s;covered a great part more of the coa&s;ts of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and gave names to diver&s;e Capes and Harbors, by which he pa&s;&s;ed: But drawing neer home, he &s;uffered two &s;uch ter|rible

&s;torms, upon the coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain,</HI> as had well nigh buried him and all his hopes in the bottome of the Sea. By rea&s;on whereof, and for the performance of &s;ome vows, which he had made in his di&s;tre&s;s, he went on Land, upon &s;ome part of the Kingdom of <HI>Portugall;</HI> which he thought he might &s;afely doe: But it proved otherwi&s;e. For the fame of his voyage being blown home before him, there was in the Court of <HI>Portugall</HI> no little matter of offence conceived again&s;t him, That he, being a Sub|ject of that Crown (as we have &s;aid he was by the right of his Wife) &s;hould doe &s;uch an emi|nent &s;ervice, without leave, to a forraign Prince, and one that perhaps, was little better than an Enemy. This was chiefly through the in&s;tigation of &s;ome malevolent per&s;ons about the King: and although the &s;ugge&s;tion were altogether injurious and groundle&s;s, <HI>Columbus</HI> having fir&s;t offered his &s;ervice to that King, and been refu&s;ed, yet it prevailed &s;o farre, that <HI>Co|lumbus</HI> was apprehended and &s;ent up to <HI>Li&s;|bon.</HI> But the King him&s;elf &s;eeing him, contra|ry to the expectation and endeavours of &s;ome about him, u&s;ed him with much re&s;pect and kindne&s;s; and after &s;ome &s;hort time, having had that di&s;cour&s;e with him, concerning his voyage and adventures, that he de&s;ired, he let

which is a Province of old <HI>Spain</HI> to St. <HI>John D' vllua,</HI> a famous and much fre|quented Port of the Province of <HI>New-Spain</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> about 1700 leagues, after the Spani&s;h mea&s;ure, which is thrice &s;o much of Italian or common miles; and with favo|rable windes they doe ordinarily di&s;patch it in two moneths and an half. To <HI>Nombre be bios,</HI> or <HI>Porto-bello,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> they reckon 1400 leagues, and doe u&s;ually make their voyage in two moneths.

For his Company, a little too much di&s;couraged with his di&s;a&s;ter, carried him back to the Ships, almo&s;t whether he would or no, to the great joy and content of the Spaniards, leaving the town and an infinite ma&s;s of trea|&s;ure behinde them untouch'd; a great part whereof they &s;aw with their own eyes in the Governors hou&s;e, namely huge bars of &s;ilver lying round about the Hall of his Palace, piled up a great height from the ground, ready to be laded and tran&s;ported for <HI>Spain,</HI> as &s;oon as the Ships came. But there wanted &s;ome re&s;o|lution in his company, by whom, being over-borne,

he was forced to put to Sea much a|gain&s;t his Will; &s;o that the &s;ucce&s;s of his fir&s;t enterpri&s;e &s;erved onely to whet his &s;tomach and courage, to give them a &s;econd vi&s;it as &s;oon as might be. Being &s;omewhat recovered of his wound, he falls with his Ships into the Sound of <HI>Darien,</HI> where he lighted upon a cer|tain People called <HI>Symerons,</HI> which are, for the mo&s;t part <HI>Negros,</HI> and &s;uch as having been Slaves to the Spaniards, by rea&s;on of their cruelty and hard u&s;age are run from them&punc; they live in Woods and wild places of the Countrie, in great companies together, not much unlike to other Savages, hating the Spa|niards deadly and doing them upon all occa|&s;ions what mi&s;chief they can. By the&s;e he gets Intelligence, that a <HI>Requa,</HI> as they there call it, that is, a certain number of Mules (mo&s;t commonly they are fourty or fiftie in a com|pany) laden with Trea&s;ure and other things, was to pa&s;s within few daies from <HI>Panama</HI> in the South-Sea, to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> to be Ship'd from thence for <HI>Spain;</HI> which he there|fore re&s;olved, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to &s;urprize. The&s;e <HI>Requas</HI> from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Ventacruz,</HI> which is about &s;ix leagues di&s;tant, in the roade to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> doe con&s;tantly travel in the night, by rea&s;on of the openne&s;s of the

Wherefore having gained a &s;ufficient number of tho&s;e <HI>Symerons</HI> to his party, which he might ea&s;ily doe, with no more than eighteen &s;tout and re&s;olute men of his own, lea|ving the re&s;t to guard and manage the Ships as occa&s;ion might be, they march by night over the Streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> as 'tis called, which is that <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> or neck of Land that joyns the two parts of <HI>America</HI> together, <HI>viz.</HI> the Northern and the Southern part, and contains in that part of it where they were, not above eighteen or twenty miles over, from Sea to Sea, though in length it be many leagues. They were come down undi&s;covered within one league of <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> and had lodged them&s;elves in a Grove on each &s;ide of the road where the <HI>Requa</HI> or company of Mules was to pa&s;s: which accor|ding to their expectation al&s;o came, and, as the manner is, &s;o tyed one to another, that if you

&s;top one, you make them all &s;tand. The <HI>Requa,</HI> which was now coming, belonged for the mo&s;t part of it, to the Trea&s;urer of <HI>Lima</HI> who with his Daughter and Family, were going for <HI>Spain</HI> with eight Mules in the company laden with Gold, and one with Jewels: which without que&s;tion had been all taken but for the indi|&s;cretion of one Engli&s;h-man, named <HI>Robert Pike;</HI> who having drank a little too much Strong-water in his martch, was become pot-valiant with it, &s;o as his companion could not keep him to his po&s;tures nor per&s;wade him to lye clo&s;e, as they were commanded to doe, till the watch-word &s;hould be given; but hearing the Mules come neer, out of a fooli&s;h bravery and ambition to be the fir&s;t that &s;hould give on&s;et in &s;uch an Action, &s;tood up; and wea|ring his &s;hirt uppermo&s;t, as they did all, the better to di&s;tingui&s;h and know one another in the night, was in&s;tantly de&s;cryed by a Spa|ni&s;h Cavaleer that rode a little before the Mules; who, &s;u&s;pecting what it might be, pre|&s;ently turn'd his hor&s;e, and gave &s;uch &s;peedy notice thereof, that the principall part of the Trea&s;ure which came behinde, together with the Trea&s;urer him&s;elf, his Daughter, and other of his company, were &s;aved by a timely retreat, and onely &s;ome few of the formo&s;t Mules ta|ken:

<P N="3">3. In the year 1577 was his voyage a|bout the World, in which to his immortall Fame and Honour, he was the fir&s;t Comman|der of note that encompa&s;&s;ed this Earths Globe and returned &s;afe home again.

<PB N="58" REF="39">
even that was not altogether without profit. For in this he not onely took and well rifled many Towns and places of the Spaniards, up|on the coa&s;ts of <HI>America</HI> (which they that write the pa&s;&s;ages of the voyage report more at large;) but e&s;pecially he met with divers rich prizes at Sea; as namely at <HI>Valparai&s;o</HI> in the South Sea, a &s;hip laden with Wines and as much of the fine&s;t Gold of <HI>Baldivia</HI> (which is counted the be&s;t of all) as amounted to thir|tie &s;even thou&s;and Duckets of Spani&s;h money, be&s;ide &s;ilver and other good Commodities. At <HI>Tarapaxa,</HI> upon the &s;ame coa&s;t, he met with thirteen bars of pure &s;ilver, amounting to four thou&s;and Duckets: And after that with eight hundred pound weight of &s;ilver, that was going for <HI>Arica</HI> to be &s;hipt from thence to <HI>Panama,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Spain,</HI> laden upon <HI>Pa|cos,</HI> which are certain Sheep of <HI>America</HI> about the bigne&s;s of A&s;&s;es, which they u&s;e as Bea&s;ts of Burthen, e&s;pecially for the carriage of their Trea&s;ure by Land from place to place. At <HI>Arica</HI> they rifle certain Barks and other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els which they found in the Port, and take out of them, be&s;ide other Merchandize, fiftie &s;even wedges of pure &s;ilver, every one of them of the weight of twenty pound a piece, and a|mounting in all to one thou&s;and one hundred

fourty pound weight of &s;ilver. At <HI>Lima</HI> they enter the Haven, where they found about twelve &s;ail of &s;hips fa&s;t moored at Anchor, their &s;ails taken off, and all the Mariners &s;ecure on &s;hore; whereupon examining the &s;hips, they finde in them, be&s;ides aboundance of Silks, Linnen and other good Commodities which they took, one che&s;t full of Ryalls, of Plate, which they thought not good to leave behinde; and (which plea&s;ed them as much as all the re&s;t) they got intelligence here of another great Spani&s;h &s;hip, called the <HI>Caca|fuego,</HI> which was at <HI>Payta,</HI> laden with nothing but Trea&s;ure.

For of four hundred men left there two or three years before, by <HI>Don Pedro Sarmiento,</HI> to that purpo&s;e by order of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> there was &s;carce twenty remaining alive when Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendi&s;h</HI> &s;ailed that way; the re&s;t were either &s;tarved for want of nece&s;&s;arie Pro|vi&s;ions, or de&s;troyed by the Natives. They had begun their Town, (which they named St. <HI>Phi|lip</HI>) upon the narrowe&s;t pa&s;&s;age of the Streits, about fourteen leagues within the mouth to the Southward, and not above half a mile broad, in a place very convenient for their purpo&s;e, and the Town it &s;elf well contrived, with four &s;everal Forts, and every Fort having &s;ome piece or pieces of Ordinance to defend it; which the Spaniards, when they &s;aw them|&s;elves left de&s;titute, and not able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t any longer there, had buried in the ground; but the carriages of them &s;tanding open and in view, upon &s;earch the pieces them&s;elves were &s;oon found and taken by the Engli&s;h.

By noon the Engli&s;h &s;hips got up with her, and gave her a broad-&s;ide, which &s;he an&s;wered: but &s;oon after put her &s;elf to a clo&s;e fight, and ex|pected boarding; which the Engli&s;h attempt|ing, were twice beaten off, and forced to be|take them&s;elves again to their Ordinance, with which they &s;o raked her from &s;ide to &s;ide, and ply'd it &s;o continually, that after a di&s;pute of &s;ome five or &s;ix hours &s;he was made to yeeld, the Captain hanging out a flag of Truce, and begging mercy for their lives: which the Ge|neral readily granted, and thereupon com|manding him to &s;trike &s;ail and come on board, the Captain, Pilot, and &s;ome of the principall Merchants did &s;o.

<P N="1">1. Hitherto we have &s;poken of &s;uch Adven|turers, and voyages to the New World, as were either publiquely or privatly owned and avowed by the State; here followeth one, who, as it &s;eems, wanted that priviledge, going onely upon <HI>jus Naturae,</HI> as he conceived, and to re|cover that by force, which he complained was by force taken from him, and having no other means left him whereby to obtain his right. This was Captain <HI>John Oxenham,</HI> a man who
<PB N="79" REF="49">
had formerly been Servant, Souldier, and Ma|riner with Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and together with him &s;u&s;tained &s;ome lo&s;s by the Spaniards at the Port of <HI>St. John D'ullua:</HI> And there|fore, notwith&s;tanding his proceedings may &s;eem to want &s;ome formalities of Law to ju|&s;tifie them, and that the Spaniards counted and &s;entenced him for a Pyrate, becau&s;e he wanted Commi&s;&s;ion; yet &s;eeing his Actions were not altogether groundle&s;s, and that his attempt was &s;o memorably daring and hardy, and al&s;o &s;o well and happily managed, &s;o far as con|cerned him&s;elf, I &s;hall not fear to add his name, and a brief report of his Action, to the re&s;t of the&s;e worthies.</P>
<P N="2">2. This man, as was &s;aid, had &s;erved Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in his Voyages and Adventures at Sea a long time, and had thereby gained him|&s;elf no &s;mall skill in Maritime affairs, and was particularly acquainted with the Coa&s;ts and Commodities of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> &s;o that by the year 1575. he was got to be Captain of a &s;hip of a hundred &amp; fourty Tuns burthen, carrying &s;eventy men in her: with which in the year above-&s;aid he &s;et &s;ail for <HI>America,</HI> and arriveth at the Sownd of <HI>Darien,</HI> at that very place, where a few years before, Sir <HI>Fran|cis Drake</HI> had fallen acquainted with the Sy|meroons

that put him upon the de&s;igne for <HI>Panama</HI> by Land, and of &s;urprizing the Trea|&s;ure Mules; a Place and People which Cap|tain <HI>Oxenham</HI> knew very well, and intended to make u&s;e of them now. Nor was it long be|fore he lighted upon &s;ome of them &s;tragling up and down in the wildes of the Country: but they tell him that the Mules travel not now, but with a &s;trong guard of Souldiers; which was &s;omewhat contrary to his expecta|tion, and alterd his de&s;igne quite: neverthe|le&s;s, being re&s;olved to Act &s;omething worthy of a man, before he returned, it &s;erved not &s;o much to di&s;animate him, as to put him and his companions upon a more hopefull, yet with|all a more hard attempt: which was, that &s;ee|ing there was now but little hopes of doing them&s;elves any good by land, as they hoped, nor by Sea on that &s;ide they were, they re&s;ol|ved to vi&s;it the other Coa&s;ts, and to trie their fortunes upon the South Sea. To this end the Captain brings his own &s;hip on ground, and, as well as he could, covers her with boughs and &s;uch other rubbi&s;h as the place afforded; and burying his Ordinance in the ground, he with his company and &s;ix Negros to conduct them, march by Land towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> Having gone a matter of twelve or
<PB N="81" REF="50">
fourteen leagues they come to a River, which, as the Symeroons told him, ran directly into the South Sea. Here they cut down wood, build them&s;elves a Pinnace of about fourty five foot long by the keel, and in her they put to Sea, making towards the I&s;land of Pearls, which lyeth about twenty five leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Panama</HI> toward the South, hoping it would not be long before &s;ome &s;hips from <HI>Peru</HI> or other parts of the South, would be &s;ailing that way for <HI>Panama.</HI> So that by the way, however Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> hath de&s;er|vedly the honour of fir&s;t di&s;covering the South Sea to Engli&s;h-men, <HI>viz.</HI> by the onely open and known way of the Streits; yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Captain <HI>Oxenham</HI> was the fir&s;t Engli&s;hman that ever &s;ailed upon it with command.</P>
<P N="3">3. He had not waited long, but there comes a Bark from <HI>Quito</HI> (which is a Province of the Countrie of <HI>Peru</HI>) laden with Commodities, and having in her be&s;ides of fine gold &s;ixtie thou&s;and <HI>Pezos,</HI> which he took; and within &s;ix dayes after another from <HI>Lima,</HI> wherein he had no le&s;s than two hundred thou&s;and Pezos of &s;ilver, in barrs. What a Pezo is, both in &s;ilver and gold hath been already &s;aid, in the relation of Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendi&s;h</HI> his voyage.
<PB N="82" REF="51">
There are that render the&s;e <HI>Pezos pounds of weight,</HI> &s;aying that he took two hundred thou|&s;and <HI>pound weight</HI> of &s;ilver, and &s;ixtie thou&s;and <HI>pound weight</HI> of gold, which perhaps is not &s;o well done, and may make the &s;umme to &s;eem le&s;s credible: for as much as every <HI>pound weight</HI> of &s;ilver, after the ordinary rate of five &s;hillings the ounce, is worth four pound of &s;il|ver in Coyne; and likewi&s;e every <HI>pound weight</HI> of gold, according to the common proportion betwixt gold and &s;ilver, which at the Indies is twelve for one, is worth fourty eight pound in Coyn; and con&s;equently the whole value of the prize would amount to above three millions in gold and &s;ilver together, <HI>viz.</HI> two millions, eight hundred, and four&s;core thou|&s;and pound in gold, and eight hundred thou|&s;and pound in &s;ilver; which perharps every body will not beleeve. I think it therefore better to expre&s;s it by the u&s;ual term and va|lue of a Pezo in Spani&s;h, which is commonly &s;aid to be eight &s;hillings of Engli&s;h money: and &s;o the whole value of the prize taken amounted to nine hundred and &s;ixtie thou&s;and pound &s;terling in gold, and to four&s;core thou|&s;and pound in &s;ilver: which being found a competent prize, and enough to &s;atisfie rea&s;o|nable men, they retire with their Pinnace up
<PB N="83" REF="51">
the River, intending to make what ha&s;te they could to their &s;hip. But as it unhappily fell out, through the covetou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;&s;ention of &s;ome of his company, &s;o much time was &s;pent before they could agree about &s;haring of their bootie, and how to tran&s;port it to their &s;hip, that the Spaniards at <HI>Panama</HI> had notice of them; whereupon &s;hips were pre&s;ently &s;ent out to pur&s;ue them at Sea, and likewi&s;e &s;ome Souldiers to intercept their return by Land. The Captain him&s;elf, through the ob&s;tinacie and willfulne&s;s of &s;ome of his company, was forced to leave the Trea&s;ure with them, and to travel &s;ome leagues up into the Countrie to finde Negros that might help him to carry it, his own men refu&s;ing to doe it but at their own demands, and quarrelling with him for larger pay. In the mean time the Spani&s;h &s;hips that &s;ought him at Sea come to the mouth of the River where they were gone up, and by the Feathers of certain Henns, which the Eng|li&s;h had taken, and, as it &s;eems, plucked there, ghe&s;&s;ed pre&s;ently that they might be gone up the River; and thereupon putting in after them, they &s;oon took both them and their prize together. The Captain, as I &s;aid, was ab&s;ent: but by rea&s;on that either the Negros, or el&s;e &s;ome of the Engli&s;h them&s;elves that
<PB N="84" REF="52">
were taken, had di&s;covered their &s;hip in the Sownd, neither he nor any of the re&s;t e&s;caped, but were all, fir&s;t or la&s;t, met with by the Spa|niards; and having no Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;hew for what they did, were executed every man of them, onely two boyes &s;aved. Thus, ended the &s;tout and re&s;olute Captain <HI>Oxenham;</HI> the Ju&s;tice of who&s;e cau&s;e I will not undertake to di&s;pute with his Adver&s;aries. I could wi&s;h it had been as perfectly ju&s;t in all re&s;pects, as it was gallant and bravely managed on the Cap|tains part; in&s;omuch that his very enemies, who made him dye for it, doe yet admire and extoll it: being &s;poyled onely through the pa&s;&s;ion, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;elf-will of &s;ome of his company, who&s;e lives paid for their follie.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe Spaniards and other Nations have not altogether the &s;ame &s;en&s;e con|cerning the &s;ituation or extent of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> Commonly they are taken to &s;ignifie that part of the World lately di&s;covered, which lyeth We&s;tward of the Worlds general and fixed Meridian, which, according to the com|mon opinion, runneth through the <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> I&s;lands, from one Pole to another, thereby dividing the Globe of the Earth into two equall parts, or Hemi&s;pheres. The Spa|niards looking to the pretended Donation or Grant, made by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the &s;ixth, to the Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Leon, of what&s;oever Lands or I&s;lands di&s;covered, or that &s;hould be di&s;covered by them &s;ailing We&s;tward of the</HI> Azores, <HI>whether upon the coa&s;t of India or el&s;e|where,</HI> doe not &s;eldom comprehend under the notion of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and the New
<PB N="86" REF="53">
World, the <HI>Moluccae</HI> and <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, with &s;ome other places in the Indian Sea, though they lie cleerly in the Ea&s;tern Hemi|&s;phere: which, becau&s;e it &s;eems not &s;o proper|ly done, and doth otherwi&s;e beget ob&s;curitie in the Authors that treat of this &s;ubject, I thought it not ami&s;s to give this <HI>Item</HI> of it here. According therefore to the mo&s;t ordi|narie and general acception of the word, <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> or the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> is that part of the World lately di&s;covered, which lyeth We&s;t|ward of the <HI>Azores,</HI> and the Worlds Meridian, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth, either in Sea or Land, the great|e&s;t part of that Hemi&s;phere, <HI>viz.</HI> the We&s;tern Hemi&s;phere of the World; the Land it &s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> being bounded Ea&s;tward and and South-Ea&s;t with the Atlantick Ocean; and We&s;tward, and to the South-we&s;t with <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> the Northern borders of it be|ing not yet known. A Countrie of &s;o va&s;t an extent, that &s;ome have equalled it to all the other three parts of the World, <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> together, to whom I can hardly a&s;&s;ent; yet doe readily acknowledge it to be much larger than any one, yea perhaps than any two of the other parts, could they be exactly compared. It lyeth for the mo&s;t part North and South, not directly, but &s;omewhat in|clining,
<PB N="87" REF="53">
in the Southern part of it, Ea&s;tward, and in the Northern part We&s;tward, being in length, as 'tis commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, from <HI>Terra Magellanica</HI> in the South, to <HI>E&s;tetiland</HI> and the further parts of <HI>Quivira</HI> in the North, above a thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;eaventy &s;eaven Spani&s;h leagues, which according to Engli&s;h or common mea&s;ure, is more than &s;ix thou&s;and miles; reaching from 60. degrees of Northern latitude (for &s;o farr it hath been di&s;|covered already by Land) unto 53 degrees of Southern: The breadth of it, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>St. Michael,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Piura,</HI> in the Pro|vince of <HI>Quito</HI> upon the South Sea, to the <HI>Prefecture</HI> and Town of <HI>Parayba</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> where it is thought to be broade&s;t, is reckoned to be 1300. leagues, and in the whole compa&s;s to contain little le&s;s than ten thou&s;and leagues, or thirty thou&s;and common Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P N="2">2. The whole Countrie lyeth in the form of two <HI>Penin&s;ula's,</HI> or large demy-I&s;lands, joyned together by an Ih&s;tmus or neck of Land called the Streit of <HI>Darien,</HI> of about an hun|dred miles in length, but in breadth, <HI>viz.</HI> from one Sea to another in many places, e&s;pe|cially about <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> not above &s;eventeen and eighteen miles over.

<P N="3">3.

Nor doe there want &s;ome pre&s;umptions of probability for it; as for ex|ample, a report of <HI>Pliny,</HI> out of <HI>Cornelius Ne|pos,</HI> an ancient and credible Author, of certain Indians that were driven by &s;torm upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Suevia,</HI> or <HI>Suaben,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> in their Canoa's or little Boats; in which it had been impo&s;&s;ible, for them to have come thi|ther by any other pa&s;&s;age, than by the North parts of <HI>America:</HI> Impo&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, to have come any other way, and not to have touched fir&s;t at &s;ome other Lands, or I&s;lands by the way, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Barbary, Spain, Portugall,</HI> the <HI>Azores,</HI> or <HI>Canarie</HI> I&s;lands; by rea&s;on that a &s;hip, or any thing el&s;e, floating at Sea, when it is not hindred or diverted by &s;torms, tide, or &s;ome other accidentall cau&s;e, naturally of it &s;elf, and by the proper cour&s;e and conduct of the waters onely, beareth to|wards

There be extant likewi&s;e &s;ome po&s;i|tive te&s;timonies of certain per&s;ons, that &s;ay, they have really pa&s;&s;ed that way, as of one <HI>Salvatierra</HI> a Portughe&s;e, and <HI>F. &V;rdanetta</HI> a Religious man, mentioned by Mr. <HI>Carpen|ter</HI> in his Geographie; and of one <HI>Juan de Fuca,</HI> is he is called, an ancient Greek Pilot, mentioned by Mr. <HI>Purchas,</HI> in his third part of <HI>Eng.

But with <HI>America</HI> it is not &s;o: there is no Countrie in the World generally more temperate in re&s;pect of heat and cold, than the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> be. The rea&s;on of the difference is partly the <HI>Bri&s;es,</HI> as they call them, or the Levant windes, which perpetually blow upon it from the Ea&s;t on both &s;ides of the Aequator, together with other windes from all coa&s;ts of the Sea, that doe much qualifie and abate the heats, which otherwi&s;e, 'tis probable, would be not a little trouble&s;ome, e&s;pecially in the plain Countrie and maritime parts of it: and partly the very &s;ite and po&s;ition of the Coun|trie it &s;elf, which more within Land is generally

mountainous and hilly: &s;o that from what&s;o|ever Coa&s;t or part of the World you enter the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> travelling forward, you &s;till mount upward and a&s;cend, as it were, in &s;ome parts, to a very great height; which is true, not onely of the Continent or main-Land, but al&s;o of all or mo&s;t of the I&s;lands adjoyning: by rea&s;on whereof, not onely the Aire, for the mo&s;t part, is found to be temperate, coole, and healthfull, but the valleys and lower grounds al&s;o very fertil and plea&s;ant. Howbeit not in all parts of the Countrie alike, either for the one or the other, <HI>viz.</HI> either in re&s;pect of tem|perature of Aire, or fertility of Soyle. For we are to know, the Countrie of <HI>America</HI> con|&s;i&s;teth generally of three &s;everal &s;orts of Land: The fir&s;t whereof is flat, and, as it were, level ground, which lyeth for the mo&s;t part upon the Sea Coa&s;ts, and takes up no &s;mall part of the Countrie, by rea&s;on that, as we have &s;aid, <HI>America</HI> is wholly, or at lea&s;t for more than three parts of four &s;urrounded and environed by Sea. The &s;econd is extream high Land, as con&s;i&s;ting of the <HI>Andes,</HI> as they are called, which are a certain ridge or row of mountains, of &s;uch incredible altitude or height, that they are not thought to be paralleld in the world again.

The third is a mean Land be|twixt both, con&s;i&s;ting partly of mountains of le&s;&s;er height, yet for the mo&s;t part running pa|rallel with the Andes through the whole Countrie of <HI>Peru</HI> Southward, and partly of vallies or low-land; both which together they call the <HI>Sierra</HI> or Hill-Countrie. And accor|ding to this diver&s;ity of &s;ite, or po&s;ition in the &s;everal parts or Provinces of <HI>America</HI> we are to expect a difference both in the temperature of the Aire, and in the qualitie of the Soyle. As for example, the Plains of <HI>America</HI> (for &s;o they are commonly called) that is, the flat and lower parts of it, which lie upon the Sea Coa&s;ts, are generally hot and neither &s;o much inhabi|ted, nor counted &s;o healthfull; yet neither are they &s;corched with any intolerable heats, by rea&s;on of the Bri&s;es, and tho&s;e other frequent Sea gales, which, as we &s;aid, are continually blowing upon them, and as it were, cooling

I call tho&s;e Commodities Mercantile, which are generally brought from thence, and
<PB N="105" REF="62">
in &s;o great aboundance, by the Merchants that trade in tho&s;e parts; of which &s;ort are chiefly the Metals of <HI>America, viz.</HI> Gold and Silver, to which mu&s;t be added the great quantity of Pearle, precious &s;tones and Jewels, yearly brought from thence, their Sugars, diver&s;e &s;orts of Spicery and Druggs, aboundance of Cotton wooll and Cloath, Hides, many kindes of wood, as well Medicinal as other: of all which my purpo&s;e is to &s;peak &s;omething, be|fore I come to the particular de&s;cription of the &s;everal Provinces in which they are found; but yet briefly, according as I am oblieged, and referring the Reader for more full &s;atisfaction upon this &s;ubject, in ca&s;e he de&s;ire it, to <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> his Hi&s;torie of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to <HI>Oviedo</HI> his ge|neral Hi&s;torie, whom I chiefly follow, and who treat of the&s;e things more at large. And fir&s;t I &s;hall begin with tho&s;e Commodities which I call Naturall; and among&s;t them with &s;uch as are of mo&s;t general nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;e for the &s;u&s;tenance of mans life, <HI>viz.</HI> with that famous plant called <HI>Maiz,</HI> and &s;ome other plants and roots, of which at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> they commonly make their bread, as we in <HI>Europe</HI> doe of Wheat and other grain.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Maiz,</HI> the common bread corn of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> is a Plant, which groweth plentifully at
<PB N="106" REF="63">
the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> in mo&s;t parts of the Continent, upon a moi&s;t and hot ground, as that generally is. It groweth upon a certain cane or reed of good bigne&s;s and about two cubits high from the ground: it groweth grape-wi&s;e, that is, the grain or fruit thereof, not covered nor inclo&s;ed in any husk or cod, as other grains of corn mo&s;t commonly are, but open and in clu|&s;ters, onely fenced on each &s;ide with a large and broad leafe, growing upwards by it to the full height of the <HI>Maiz.</HI> The clu&s;ter, or bunch of grains, is commonly a &s;pan and half long, &s;ometimes more, rending &s;harp up to|wards the top in the fa&s;hion of a Sugar-loaf, and of the bigne&s;s ordinarily of a mans arme; having upon the top of the clu&s;ter a certain tuft or bunch of long hairy fillets, which, as the grain comes to maturity, doe likewi&s;e grow long, and bend downwards on one &s;ide of the bunch, not much unlike to the fore-top of Time and Opportunitie, as they commonly picture it. The grains of this <HI>Maiz</HI> are round, like unto pea&s;e, but bigger: yet commonly &s;ix or &s;even hundred of them are contained in one clu&s;ter, and for the mo&s;t part two or three clu&s;ters upon every cane or reed. They are white till they come to be ripe, and then they turn outwardly black, but the flower of them,
<PB N="107" REF="63">
or &s;ub&s;tance within, is &s;till as white as &s;now: and maketh a kinde of bread, for &s;trength or nouri&s;hment nothing inferiour to wheat. It naturally ingendreth much blood; &s;o that &s;trangers not u&s;ed to it, if they eate overmuch of it at fir&s;t, are &s;ubject to &s;wel upon it, to be|come &s;cabbie, and obnoxious to &s;uch other di&s;ea&s;es, as proceed of too much aboundance and heat of blood: but to &s;uch as are u&s;ed to it and eate it moderately, they &s;ay, it is a mo&s;t agreeable kinde of food, ea&s;ie of concoction, not at all ob&s;tructive, as bread with us, whe|ther of wheat or other grain, is generally held to be more or le&s;s, but rather in &s;ome degree purgative of noxious humors, and helpfull a|gain&s;t the &s;tone, and other oppilations of the body; with which infirmities the Indians, that continually feed upon this <HI>Maiz,</HI> both in bread and many other waies dre&s;&s;ed, are ob|&s;erved &s;eldom or never be troubled. The buds of it while they are green and tender, are of &s;uch a fat and delicious &s;ub&s;tance, that they u&s;e them commonly in&s;tead of oyle and butter, being no le&s;s plea&s;ant and agreeable to the ta&s;te. They make Wine of it al&s;o, or a drink not le&s;s &s;trong than Wine, and which, being freely ta|ken, as quickly overcoms a man: which they make by &s;teeping the grains of <HI>Maiz</HI> in wa|ter
<PB N="108" REF="64">
till it breaks, and afterwards boyling it, much after the manner as we make ordinarily our beer of Mault. There are diver&s;e &s;orts of this <HI>Maiz,</HI> but that which is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed for bread, is this already de&s;cribed. Their way of eating it, e&s;pecially with the commo|ner &s;ort of People, is mo&s;t commonly boyled in the grain hot, which they doe much after the manner that the People of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Ja|pan</HI> u&s;e in the boyling of their Rice, They have an earthen or &s;ome other &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;el full of little holes at the bottom and round about the &s;ides below, into which having put &s;o much of the grains of <HI>Maiz</HI> as they think fit, and &s;topt it up; they &s;et it into another ve&s;&s;el which they have full of water and already boyling on the fire; &s;o as the water enters by little and little into the ve&s;&s;el where the <HI>Maiz</HI> is, through the little holes: with which the <HI>Maiz</HI> pre&s;ent|ly beginneth to &s;wel, and after a little boyling &s;o &s;tops the holes of the ve&s;&s;el, that no more water can enter; and &s;o boyling it on &s;till, it comes at la&s;t from a pulp or &s;oft moi&s;ty &s;ub|&s;tance, to be more firm and hard, and &s;uch as they u&s;e for bread. And when they eate it &s;in|gle or alone as bread, they count this the be&s;t way of eating it, <HI>viz.</HI> in the grain hot: but otherwi&s;e dre&s;&s;ing it, as they oftentimes doe,
<PB N="109" REF="64">
with oyle, butter, &s;ugar, and diver&s;e &s;orts of Spice, they make many other plea&s;ant and de|licious meats of it. This, as I &s;aid, is the more common way of u&s;ing it by the ordinary &s;ort of people; but the rich and better &s;ort grinde the <HI>Maiz,</HI> as we doe our wheat, and bake it, for the mo&s;t part, into little cakes, which con|fectioned with &s;ugar and &s;pices, as they u&s;e, doe make a very curious and dainty kinde of meat.</P>
<P N="3">3. This is their <HI>Maiz,</HI> or the Indian wheat, as they call it. They have another kinde of bread at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> called <HI>Ca&s;&s;avi,</HI> made of a certain root which they call <HI>Jucca:</HI> it is a root of a large &s;ize and &s;omewhat of a moi&s;t &s;ub&s;tance, the juyce whereof is held to be a kinde of poy&s;on, e&s;pecially to &s;ome per&s;ons: for of others I read, that they have eate of the root green and full of juyce, though not with|out danger, nor perhaps without co&s;ting &s;ome of them their lives, as namely the Engli&s;h at <HI>Port-rico</HI> under the Earle of <HI>Cumberland:</HI> but the root of it, when it is well dryed, e&s;pecially if they u&s;e &s;o much art with it, as to grinde it and work it into pa&s;te, is made into a very good &s;ort of bread&punc; yet more nouri&s;hing than tooth&s;ome. For the chief art which they u&s;e about it, is rather in the planting of the root
<PB N="110" REF="65">
than otherwi&s;e, of which the manner is thus. They rai&s;e a bed of earth in &s;ome lu&s;ty and good &s;oile of about nine or ten foot &s;quare every way, in which, at an equall di&s;tance, they &s;et ten or twelve &s;lips, as I may call them, or little branches, which grow naturally out of the &s;ame root, each of them about a foot long, on every &s;ide of the bed commonly three, and laid &s;o a&s;lope within the ground, that the ends of them all doe almo&s;t meet together in the middle of the bed: Out of the&s;e after a certain time there &s;prings a &s;et of new roots, which grow commonly to the bigne&s;s and length of a mans arme, and &s;ometimes as big as a mans thigh; but this is onely when they let them lye a long time in the ground, <HI>viz.</HI> a year, or year and half: but then likewi&s;e they are &s;aid to be be&s;t, and to make the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant and agreeable bread. By that time they are come to maturitie, the whole bed or plat of earth, on which they were planted, &s;eems to to be all turned into roots. Then they take them out of the ground, and having &s;craped them a little on the out&s;ide, they &s;lice or cut them into &s;mall pieces; which done, in a pre&s;s made for that purpo&s;e, they &s;train and force out all the juyce they can, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as &s;ome Countrie folk &s;train crabs, and pre&s;s their

chee&s;e when they make it: and having by that means brought their <HI>Jucca</HI> into the fa&s;hion of a broad cake, but &s;omewhat thin, they lay it up for &s;ome time, till it be more throughly dryed, and then u&s;e it for bread without more trouble. 'Tis &s;aid to have little or no ta&s;te at all in the eating (and that's probable enough, by the ordering of it) but as for vertue and nouri&s;hment, wondrous&punc; good and whol&s;ome; yet I remember <HI>Aco&s;ta,</HI> who had ta&s;ted of it, &s;ayes plainly, he had rather eat a piece of the cour&s;e&s;t and blacke&s;t bread he ever &s;aw in his life. Neither doe they eate it, but fir&s;t moi&s;t|ned and &s;teeped in &s;ome water or warm broath: the rea&s;on whereof is the exce&s;&s;ive dryne&s;s of the bread, which is &s;uch that neither Wine, nor Milk, nor their <HI>Mela&s;&s;o,</HI> as they call it, which is the honey or &s;weet juyce of the &s;ugar canes will pierce it; and therefore it keeps long, and they carrie it commonly to Sea in&s;tead of Bisket. By Land it is chiefly u&s;ed in the <HI>Barlovente</HI> I&s;lands, which are <HI>Hi&s;paniola, Cuba, Jamaica, &amp;c.</HI> where there is not &s;uch plenty either of Wheat or <HI>Maiz;</HI> not through any defect or barrenne&s;s of the &s;oile, but as it is rather thought, from &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition of the Aire and Climate; which is &s;uch, that the very meal which they bring thither &s;ometimes
<PB N="112" REF="66">
from <HI>New Spain</HI> and from the <HI>Canaries,</HI> con|tracts pre&s;ently &s;uch a moi&s;tne&s;s, that they can hardly make any good bread of it; and that which they doe make will not keep, but in a few daies become moi&s;t and fluid again, and by con&s;equence apt to corrupt; which is ge|nerally attributed to the over-much humidity and heat of the Countrie.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is yet a third &s;ort of bread made at the Indies, which they call <HI>Chugno,</HI> and is made likewi&s;e of a certain &s;mall root called <HI>Popa.</HI> This bread is u&s;ed chiefly upon the <HI>Andes,</HI> and &s;ome parts of the <HI>Sierra</HI> or Hill-Countrie, and generally in all the colder parts and Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> where the root groweth plenti|fully, and where, by rea&s;on of the cold, there is not &s;o great plenty of Wheat or <HI>Maiz,</HI> nor yet perhaps of <HI>Ca&s;&s;avi</HI> or <HI>Jucca;</HI> which, how dry &s;oever it be, when they have reduc'd it to bread, yet naturally is of a gro&s;s and juycie &s;ub&s;tance, lu&s;cious, or at lea&s;t, not unplea&s;ing to the ta&s;te, and requireth a warm and lu&s;ty &s;oile. The&s;e <HI>Popas</HI> are a kinde of &s;maller root, not unlike to the <HI>Bulboca&s;tanum,</HI> or ground-Che&s;nut, with many leaves growing out upon them: which they onely dry well in the Sun, and then grinde them; making a kinde of bread of them, which will keep long, and is probably
<PB N="113" REF="66">
of a good and &s;trong nouri&s;hment; for it is much u&s;ed at the Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> where the labour is hard. They eate the&s;e roots al&s;o dre&s;&s;ed otherwi&s;e, both boyled and baked, and account them a very good meat.</P>

<P>Of &s;ome choi&s;e and excellent Fruits, and Fruit-bearing Trees at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THey have likewi&s;e plenty of Rice and Millet growing in <HI>America;</HI> but becau&s;e they u&s;e them not &s;o generally for bread, and that they are not proper to the Countrie, but found as plentifully el&s;where, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over, and come to &s;peak of &s;uch Fruits, Fruit-bearing trees, and others, as are peculiar to the <HI>New-world,</HI> and either not at all, or not &s;o plentifully, or at lea&s;t not of &s;uch perfection and excellency found any where el&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Among&s;t the Fruits, and trees that bear Fruit, at the <HI>New World,</HI> the <HI>Platano,</HI> or Plane tree, I &s;uppo&s;e, for many re&s;pects may de&s;erve the fir&s;t place; not that it is the &s;ame tree which <HI>Pliny</HI> and the Ancients call the Plane, being
<PB N="114" REF="67">
neither &s;o big (in any proportion) nor afford|ing &s;uch a &s;hade as the Roman Plane is &s;aid to doe; but onely for &s;ome re&s;emblance which it beareth towards it, and e&s;pecially in the largene&s;s of its leaves, wherein the Plane at the Indies doth much exceed even that of the An|cients. It groweth commonly two &s;tades, or twice the height of a Man, from the ground, in a moi&s;t and wet &s;oile, which it nece&s;&s;arily requireth, by rea&s;on that it makes a great &s;tock, as they &s;ay, in the ground, that is, it ca&s;teth a very large root every way round about its bulk or body: which it &s;elf is not much above the bigne&s;s of a mans: out of which root, on all &s;ides their &s;pring diver&s;e <HI>Siens</HI> or young <HI>Planes,</HI> round about the principal tree, every one apart by him&s;elf, and bearing fruit. The leaves of it are of a wonderfull bigne&s;s, of an ell broad, as &s;ome &s;ay, and above an ell and half long, hanging down to the ground, and &s;ufficient to cover an ordinary man of &s;tature from head to foot. The Fruit is for the mo&s;t part a &s;pan long, and of the thickne&s;s of a Mans wri&s;t, &s;omewhat bending in the middle, and groweth in clu&s;ters commonly upon one bough, but that one &s;o well laden, that it is &s;aid to be no unu&s;ual thing to gather two or three hundred Apples off that one bough. The
<PB N="115" REF="67">
Apple or Fruit of the <HI>Plane</HI> is at fir&s;t green: but as it comes to ripene&s;s, it turns yellow both within and without, and becomes a mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Fruit both for &s;ight and ta&s;te; though ma|ny times they gather it green, and let it ripen in ve&s;&s;els made for that purpo&s;e; but it is be&s;t and &s;weete&s;t, when it ripens upon the tree: The meat or &s;ub&s;tance of the Fruit within, when the rinde is taken off, is tender, very de|licious and well nouri&s;hing, inclining never|thele&s;s rather to cold than heat. The tree beareth fruit all the year long (as they &s;ay, 'tis u&s;uall at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> for many or mo&s;t Fruit-bearing trees to doe) and yet the &s;ame bough or &s;talk on which the fruit hangs, never beareth twice; but being cut away, another pre&s;ently &s;prouteth in its room: &s;o that there is a continuall &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as it were, of new &s;prigs, young boughs, green fruit and ripe, ever following one another upon the principal &s;tock. They are &s;aid to have whole groves of this kinde of tree in many parts of <HI>America,</HI> the fruit whereof yeelds no little profit and revenue to the owners; it being a fruit where|in the Indians doe generally much delight, eating it commonly not onely raw, but likewi&s;e roa&s;ted, boyled in pottage, ba|ked, con&s;erv'd, confectioned, and a hun|dred
<PB N="116" REF="68">
other wayes, in all which it &s;erveth very well.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Coco</HI> is another excellent Fruit at the Indies. The tree which beareth it, is recko|ned a kinde of Palme tree, not properly, but by rea&s;on of &s;ome re&s;emblance it hath in growth to the ordinary Palme. It grows much upon the Sea coa&s;t, upon a dry and &s;an|dy ground, yet alwaies hot: and 'tis &s;aid then be&s;t of all to flouri&s;h, when 'tis planted neer to a Village, or &s;ome hou&s;es, or by the way &s;ide, &s;eeming, as it were to be delighted, and to thrive the better for the du&s;t and dirt, which in &s;uch places it is beaten withall. The body of the tree is &s;mooth and &s;lender, being in no part bigger about than a mans middle, and growing &s;till more and more &s;lender towards the top: nor doth it ever &s;hoot forth a bough, &s;prig, or leafe, but at the very top, which is u&s;ually of the height of thirty or fourty foot at lea&s;t; But there it brancheth out into many &s;mall boughs, in fa&s;hion not unlike to an O&s;tridges feather, thick &s;et and not growing upward, but running out and &s;preading broad, as they grow, on all &s;ides of the tree or &s;tock. Uunderneath, and, as it were, in the &s;hade and coverture of which boughs, the <HI>Cocos,</HI> or <HI>Co|ker-nuts,</HI> as they call them (which are the fruit
<PB N="117" REF="68">
of the tree) doe grow in little clu&s;ters, &s;ome|times three or four of them together, imme|diatly out of the &s;tem or &s;tock of the tree, reaching according to the number and quan|tity of them that grow, about a yard or more downward from the boughs. Every <HI>Coco</HI> or Nut is commonly as big as a mans head, of the fa&s;hion of the le&s;&s;er &s;ort of Mellons, and of &s;o hard a &s;hel, that if one of them &s;hould happen to light upon a mans head, falling from the tree (as commonly they doe fall when they are ripe) con&s;idering the height of the tree, he would have no great need of a Surgeon. Ne|verthele&s;s the Fruit it &s;elf is admirable and rare in many re&s;pects, and &s;erves the Indians for a hundred u&s;es both of nece&s;&s;ity and delight. Outwardly it is fenced with a green rinde or covering of a fibrous &s;ub&s;tance, full of many &s;mall &s;trings or &s;inews, like threds; which therefore, when it is dry, they card out into a kinde of hards or cour&s;e Tow, and make cord|age of it, ropes for their Canoa's and &s;hips, Match; but mo&s;t commonly they u&s;e it for the &s;topping up of the ribs of &s;hips, and in leakes; to which purpo&s;e it &s;erveth excellently well, by rea&s;on that if it be never &s;o little moi&s;tened, it pre&s;ently &s;wels, and by that means keeps out water better than any other &s;tuff
<PB N="118" REF="69">
they can u&s;e. Next to this rinde or outmo&s;t covering, which is commonly two fingers thick, there is a hard &s;hell which contains in it a certain liquid &s;ub&s;tance, very delicious and plea&s;ant, which while the fruit is green, is thin and cleer like water, but as white as milk, which they therefore drink both for the dain|tine&s;s of the ta&s;te, and to cool them in the heat; but when the fruit comes to be ripe, it grows more jelly and thick, and likewi&s;e more plea|&s;ant. The quantity of it is commonly a pint and half, or a quart, more or le&s;s according to the bigne&s;s of the <HI>Coco.</HI> Of this liquor, be&s;ide that they drink it immediatly out of the fruit, as I have &s;aid, according to &s;everal waies which they u&s;e it, they make both Oyle, Wine, Vine|gar, and al&s;o milk of it; and &s;erves rea&s;onably well in all. The liquor it &s;elf drunk raw out of the fruit, is thought to be &s;omewhat flatu|lent, and to breed crudities and other gro&s;s humours in the body, if it &s;hould be drunk over-much: neverthele&s;s it procures urine aboundantly, and they &s;ay the Indians, who continually drink of it, are &s;o little troubled with the &s;tone or any other infirmities of the Reins, that they know not what they mean: and it yeeldeth &s;uch plenty of this liquor, that one tree of the&s;e <HI>Cocos,</HI> if it thrives well, is
<PB N="119" REF="69">
thought &s;ufficient to &s;upply a whole Family of no great number of per&s;ons, with Wine, Oyle, and Milk of it &s;elf alone. For every moneth it &s;hoots forth new boughs and new <HI>Cocos,</HI> and 'tis not counted a good tree that beareth not fourty or fiftie <HI>Cocos,</HI> at lea&s;t, every moneth. In the mid&s;t of this liquor lyeth the kernel of the Nut, or the principal meat of the <HI>Coco.</HI> This is a white and tender &s;ub&s;tance, in ta&s;te much like unto Almonds, taking up all the re&s;t of the room in the <HI>Coco</HI>-&s;hel, and con|taining likewi&s;e in it another &s;weet and deli|cate liquor, which is held to be both comforta|ble and cordial. They have likewi&s;e another way to extract Wine out of the <HI>Coco;</HI> which is to cut the rinde and bark off the tree, but mo&s;t e&s;pecially off the boughs and fruit, while it is green, from which pre&s;ently there i&s;&s;ueth and drops a certain liquor no le&s;s plea&s;ant than Wine, which they receive into ve&s;&s;els prepared for that purpo&s;e; which liquor they commonly al&s;o boyle, and make of it a kinde of Honey or Sugar, more e&s;teemed than that which is common.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is another kinde of this <HI>Coco,</HI> which groweth mo&s;t upon the <HI>Andes,</HI> in bigne&s;s not much le&s;s than the other; but in&s;tead of the fat oylie &s;ub&s;tance in the middle of tho&s;e of the
<PB N="120" REF="70">
fir&s;t &s;ort, the&s;e are filled with an huge number of &s;mall kernels or nuts, like to Almonds, or the graines of a Pomegranate admirably com|pacted and laid together. The&s;e kernels differ not much from Almonds in ta&s;te, and are a meat rea&s;onably plea&s;ant, &s;o as the Confectio|ners u&s;e them commonly for Marchpains and other banquetting Stuff, in&s;tead of Almonds; although of that kinde of fruit, <HI>viz.</HI> Almonds, they want not mo&s;t excellent ones at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Province of <HI>Cha|copoyas</HI> in the Kingdome of <HI>Peru,</HI> which are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, delicate, and whol&s;ome fruit in the World, of a more fat tender and delicous &s;ub&s;tance by far, than tho&s;e of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and for the mo&s;t part much bigger.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is at the <HI>New World</HI> another tree called <HI>Coca,</HI> which though it bea|reth not any fruit that is much &s;poken of, yet by rea&s;on it hath &s;ome affinitie of name with the <HI>Coco,</HI> and is likewi&s;e a tree not a little e&s;teemed there, it requireth that we &s;peak &s;omething of it. It is a tree that grows well onely upon hot and moi&s;t grounds, and not much above a fathom high from the ground; yet requiring good care and skil to husband it. It is in e&s;timation onely for its broad leafe,
<PB N="121" REF="70">
which it ca&s;teth forth every fourth moneth new, to which leafe the Indians attribute I know not how many &s;trange vertues and ope|rations. This is certain and confirmed by dai|ly experience, that it helpeth much again&s;t wearine&s;s of the bodie in any kinde of labour or travell, that it reviveth and exhilarates a mans &s;pirits, &s;eeming to infu&s;e new courage and &s;trength into him; in&s;omuch that the In|dians will oftentimes goe three or four daies together about bu&s;ine&s;s with no other meat or victuals but a few leaves of this <HI>Coca</HI> cham|ped in their mouthes. For which rea&s;on 'tis counted one of the chiefe&s;t Commodities at <HI>Potozi,</HI> not onely among&s;t the Miners them|&s;elves, but generally with all other People; and they travel far to get it, <HI>viz.</HI> as far as the <HI>Andes,</HI> on the skirts whereof it chiefly groweth. They gather it with a great deale of care; and the leafe being very broad, they have great Baskets or Hampers made on purpo&s;e, into which they put it, and &s;o lade their Mules or <HI>Pacos</HI> with it, and away for <HI>Potozi,</HI> where it is pre&s;ent Merchandi&s;e. They &s;ell it for the mo&s;t part at three or four <HI>pe|zos</HI> a Basket, and vend commonly one yeer with another four-&s;core or a hundred thou|&s;and Basket sthere.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="122" REF="71">6. Another admirable tree there is at the Indies, called the <HI>Magney</HI> or <HI>Mete-tree;</HI> of which they report wonders, as namely that it yeeldeth them both Water, Wine, Oyle, Vi|negar, Thred, Needles, and I know not how many other nece&s;&s;ary things be&s;ide; not alto|gether untruly. The tree, according to the de&s;cription which <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> gives of it, is of a big body, and groweth commonly in the open fields, being of a moi&s;t and tender &s;ub&s;tance, hollow in the mid&s;t: which therefore, when it is green, they u&s;e to cut; and at the places where they make inci&s;ion, there i&s;&s;ueth a cer|tain liquor fre&s;h and &s;weet, which they com|monly drink raw, as it i&s;&s;ueth from the tree, gathering it in ve&s;&s;els of gourds, <HI>Coco</HI>-&s;hels, and others which they &s;et there on purpo&s;e to receive it. This liquor, according as they &s;eeth or boyle it more or le&s;s, becomes a Wine of a plea&s;ant good ta&s;te, or Honey, or Sirup, or Vinegar, every one in their kinde good and whol&s;ome. It beareth a large broad leafe, or rather, as &s;ome &s;ay, diver&s;e kindes of leaves; of which, while they are tender, they make rare and curious con&s;erves; but when they are grown out to their full bigne&s;s, being of a gro&s;s fibrous &s;ub&s;tance, they draw out of it a kinde of thred like unto Hemp or Flax, which
<PB N="123" REF="71">
they afterwards &s;pin and work into Mantles, Matts, Shoes, Girdles and many other nece&s;|&s;ary things, and of the re&s;t make a &s;ort of cour&s;e Paper: and of the point of the leafe, which is both hard and al&s;o very &s;harp, they make Needles, that is, &s;uch in&s;truments to &s;ow withall as they had and u&s;ed before the Spaniards came among them. The bark of the tree is both fat and very unctious; &s;o that, being roa&s;ted they make a &s;alve of it, as 'tis &s;aid, very good for hurts, brui&s;es and old &s;ores; and from the boughs they gather a certain gum, which they likewi&s;e report to be a &s;overeign Antidote again&s;t poy&s;ons. The trees grow generally in all parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but chiefly in the Countrie of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>New Spain;</HI> wher there is &s;car&s;e an Indian to be found worth the hou&s;e that he dwels in, but will be carefull to have &s;ome of the&s;e trees planted and growing about it, for the many nece&s;&s;arie &s;up|plies which it affordeth towards the mainte|nance of a hou&s;e and family.</P>
<P N="7">7. And in the Countrie of <HI>New Spain</HI> there likewi&s;e groweth another famous tree, called the <HI>Tuna</HI> or <HI>Tunall</HI> tree. It is originally from the root, nothing but a heap, as it were, of great broad leaves growing one out of ano|ther, as well from the ground as upwards;
<PB N="124" REF="72">
the leaves long and large, not &s;harp or pointed, but round at the ends, and of the thickne&s;s of a mans thumb or finger: in which manner growing, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth in time a good large &s;pace of ground, and likewi&s;e grows upward into the fa&s;hion and height of &s;ome ordinary tree. Its manner of growing is onely by new leaves &s;prouting out at the ends of the old, and the old ones &s;till waxing bigger and bigger; &s;o that at la&s;t it &s;eemeth to have got a body and boughs, which is yet nothing el&s;e but the roots of the bige&s;t and elde&s;t leaves, now at length come to be hardned into a &s;tock or trunk; the leaves them&s;elves being commonly thick &s;et with certain long and &s;harp prickles, of a whiti&s;h colour. There are two &s;orts of them, the wilde, and the garden or planted <HI>Tunall;</HI> both of which beare a fruit, but very different one from the other, both for ta&s;te and u&s;e. The garden or planted <HI>Tunall,</HI> bears a fruit well e&s;teemed with the Indians for meat, being &s;omewhat bigger than ordinary plums, and ha|ving many little grains lying in the pulp or &s;ub&s;tance of it, like figgs, of a white colour, good ta&s;te, and no le&s;s plea&s;ant than figgs; and be&s;ide that, of a delicate &s;ent or &s;mell. The fruit of the wilde <HI>Tunall</HI> is green, growing (as al&s;o the other doth) out of the very top of
<PB N="125" REF="72">
the leafe, in the fa&s;hion of a fig, narrow below or towards the leafe, but upwards growing broad and round, and on the top invironed with a &s;et of thick leaves in fa&s;hion of a Crown or Coronet. The pulp of it, or &s;ub&s;tance with|in, is juycie and red, but neither plea&s;ing, nor any way commended for the ta&s;te, as I ob|&s;erve: in &s;tains the hands of any that touch it with a deep red or &s;anguine colour, like Mul|berries; and which is more than that, the urine of tho&s;e that eate of it, will &s;eem as if it were all turned into blood; in&s;omuch that &s;ome have been much frighted at their fir&s;t eating thereof, and taken them&s;elves for dead men, finding their urine to be &s;o &s;trangely changed, and not knowing the qualitie of the fruit. Within the Coronet, or circle of leaves, which grow upon the top of the fruit, there are ma|ny little grains contained, which are the &s;eed of the <HI>Tunall,</HI> and out of which, if they &s;et them, there &s;prings forth a Plant of the &s;ame kinde, round-bodied and not unlike to the trunck of other trees, when they fir&s;t &s;pring out of the ground, which pre&s;ently &s;preads it &s;elf into leaves growing one out of another &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, as the fir&s;t did. This kinde of <HI>Tunall,</HI> as we &s;aid, is not &s;o much regarded for its fruit, but for another commoditie which comes of it,
<PB N="126" REF="73">
of far greater profit and advantage than the fruit could be&punc; were it much better than it is; <HI>viz.</HI> for the grain, called <HI>Cochinele,</HI> &s;o famous and &s;o much u&s;ed by the Dyers for the dying of perfect Scarlets, or colours in grain, which is made of this tree in manner as followeth. Upon the leaves of the wilde <HI>Tunall</HI> there groweth u&s;ually out certain tuberous or fun|gous excre&s;cencies, which, in time, turn into a kinde of In&s;ect, or Worme, and multiplyeth &s;o much, that at la&s;t all the leaves of the tree, which, as it was &s;aid, are very large, and as thick ordinarily as the thumb or finger of a mans hand, &s;eem to be turned into a web of Worms, hanging and interwoven together by the <HI>fibrae,</HI> or little &s;inews of the leaves. The&s;e webs or verminated folio's of the <HI>Tunall,</HI> the Indians husband with a great deal of care and indu&s;trie, both while they are a breeding and afterwards, till they be well dryed; at which time making them up into boxes or little casks, they &s;end them into <HI>Spain,</HI> and other parts of the World, as a great and rich Mer|chandi&s;e; which doubtle&s;s they are. For 'tis &s;aid, they &s;end commonly, one year with ano|ther, betwixt five and &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Arrobes</HI> of <HI>Cochinele</HI> onely into <HI>Spain</HI> (every <HI>Arrobe</HI> con|taining five and twenty pound weight at lea&s;t)
<PB N="127" REF="73">
which, according to the u&s;ual rate they are &s;old at, amounts to two hundred eighty three thou&s;and, &s;even hundred and fiftie <HI>Pezos</HI> by account.</P>
<P N="8">8.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Cacao,</HI> and the famous drink called <HI>Cho|colatte,</HI> of <HI>Atolle,</HI> and other drinks u&s;ed at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. I Should commit a great over&s;ight, if in treating of the Commodities and Rarities of the <HI>New-World,</HI> I &s;hould forget the <HI>Cacao;</HI> which, though it be but a &s;mall fruit, or|dinarily not bigger than an Almond, and hardly of &s;o good a ta&s;te; yet becau&s;e it is &s;o proper to the Countrie, &s;o plentifully there growing, and likewi&s;e &s;o much e&s;teemed and u&s;ed as it is, almo&s;t in all kinde of bartery and traffique, I mu&s;t not altogether omit it. It is a fruit, which with the Americans is almo&s;t every thing; it is both meat, drink, and money. It grows upon a &s;mall tree of the bigne&s;s and fa&s;hion of that of the Pome-citron, thriving
<PB N="130" REF="75">
be&s;t upon hot ground, yet in &s;uch places where it is well &s;hadowed from the Sun. There be &s;everal kindes of them; and by the de&s;cription which <HI>Hernandez,</HI> or rather <HI>Antonius Recchius,</HI> makes of the <HI>Cacao,</HI> in his general Hi&s;torie of American Plants, printed at <HI>Rome</HI> 1651. it &s;eems that <HI>Herrera, Aco&s;ta,</HI> and others are not &s;o exact in their report of this fruit, who gene|rally de&s;cribe it as a fruit &s;omewhat le&s;s than an Almond, whereas <HI>Hernandez,</HI> a Doctor of Phy&s;ick, and one who lived many yeers in tho&s;e parts, by command of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> on purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve the Natures of &s;uch Plants and Phy&s;ical rarities as <HI>America</HI> afford|ed, makes &s;ome kindes of <HI>Cacao</HI> to be as big as a good Mellon or Pompion, and none le&s;s than the greate&s;t &s;ort of Apples. To reconcile them I &s;uppo&s;e we mu&s;t &s;ay, that what <HI>Aco&s;ta, Her|rera,</HI> and others call the <HI>Cacao,</HI> is but the ker|nel of that <HI>Cacao</HI> which <HI>Hernandez</HI> de&s;cribeth; and that there grow many of the&s;e le&s;&s;er <HI>Ca|caos</HI> together, in one common husk, rinde, or &s;hell: which <HI>Hernandez</HI> likewi&s;e intimates when he &s;ayes the <HI>Cacao</HI> contains within it <HI>diver&s;e &s;mall parts clo&s;e compacted together,</HI> and afterwards calls that <HI>the &s;eed,</HI> or kernel, <HI>of Cacao,</HI> which the Americans u&s;e in&s;tead of money, and whereof they make drink, which
<PB N="131" REF="75">
is the very <HI>Cacao</HI> that <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> and others onely mention, without taking notice of any other. It is a fruit of a tender and fat &s;ub&s;tance, of good nouri&s;hment, e&s;pecially roa&s;ted, boyled, or any other way dre&s;&s;ed: raw, or eaten out of the fruit onely, it cau&s;eth, as &s;ome &s;ay, oppi|lations and ob&s;tructions of the &s;tomach. Yet the Indian women love it extreamly, and think them&s;elves never well but when they are &s;uck|ing the skin or film of it, which is commonly a white juycie &s;ub&s;tance, but &s;ometimes red or Murrey, which they finde to be very cooling to them in tho&s;e hotter Climates, and have an opinion al&s;o that it makes them fair. It is a fruit that la&s;teth long, and impaireth not much by age; in re&s;pect whereof, and that it is &s;o generally e&s;teemed there, the Indians com|monly u&s;e it in&s;tead of money, as hath been &s;aid, buying, or having in exchange for <HI>Cacao</HI> almo&s;t every thing in the Market. But the chief rea&s;on of its &s;o general e&s;teem and u&s;e at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> is, a certain drink they make of it, called <HI>Chocolatte;</HI> which, becau&s;e it is a liquor that the Americans extreamly love, and that it begins likewi&s;e to be cryed up in &s;ome parts of <HI>Europe</HI> for an excellent drink (though all men give not the &s;ame report of it) I &s;hall relate, as briefly as I can, how they make it, from
<PB N="132" REF="76">
the report of a late traveller in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P N="2">2. They take a certain quantity of <HI>Cacao</HI> nuts or almonds, as we call them; which, having well dryed, they pound them w^t^h &s;om cods of <HI>Chili,</HI> or long red Pepper of <HI>America,</HI> a handfull of Anni&s;eed, &s;ome quantity of Cinnamon, Cloves, and likewi&s;e of white Sugar, till they have brought them all into a &s;oft powder, or pa&s;te, which they put up into boxes or tablets of what quantitie and bigne&s;s they plea&s;e, laying it fir&s;t upon paper within the box, from which, upon occa&s;ion, the powder or pa&s;te will ea&s;ily &s;eparate; but to any thing that is of earth or wood it &s;ticks fa&s;t. They put to it likewi&s;e certain grains of <HI>Achiotte,</HI> which is another fruit of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> growing much after the manner of <HI>Cacao, viz.</HI> many grains of it together in one husk or cod, all of them red. This is onely to give the <HI>Cacao</HI> a good colour; and the <HI>Achiotte</HI> is commonly pounded by it &s;elf, and &s;old in boxes, or little round cakes, yet &s;o fine and dry, that it will ea|&s;ily mix and incorporate it &s;elf with the <HI>Cacao,</HI> to give it tincture. The better &s;ort, and they that mean to make the <HI>Chocolatte</HI> rich and very plea&s;ing, add many other ingredients; but the&s;e already mentioned are the mo&s;t com|monly u&s;ed; and the <HI>Cacao</HI> thus made up, they
<PB N="133" REF="76">
&s;ell u&s;ually at four &s;hillings a pound. This is <HI>Chocolatte,</HI> or the confectioned <HI>Cacao.</HI> And as there is difference in the compo&s;ition of it, &s;o likewi&s;e they drink it diver&s;e waies. The riche&s;t is that which is u&s;ed by the Gallants and Ladies at <HI>Mexico, viz.</HI> to drink hot with <HI>Atolle,</HI> after this manner. They di&s;&s;olve a box or tablet of <HI>Cacao</HI> in &s;ome little quantity of pure hot water, &s;tanding on the fire; and ha|ving fir&s;t with a Molinet, or &s;ome other in|&s;trument, &s;tirred it up, and well mixed the <HI>Cacao</HI> and water together, they put &s;o much of <HI>Atolle</HI> into it, as fills up the Cup or ve&s;&s;ell, and &s;o drink it by &s;uppings very hot. This <HI>Atolle</HI> is it &s;elf a rich and delicious liquor, of which I &s;hall &s;peak by and by. But the mo&s;t u&s;ual way of drinking it is, to di&s;&s;olve a box or Tablet of <HI>Cacao</HI> in hot water, and having well &s;weetned it with Sugar, to drink it with|out more adoe, onely with &s;ome con&s;erves, or Naples-Bisket, either dry or &s;teeped in the <HI>Chocolatte,</HI> as every one plea&s;e. Sometimes al|&s;o they di&s;&s;olve it in cold water, and &s;tir it con|tinually with a Molinet, til it ri&s;e to a &s;cum, or froth, which they take off, and put into &s;ome other ve&s;&s;el or cup, and make the other hot; which when they have likewi&s;e &s;weetned with Sugar, they poure out into the ve&s;&s;el,
<PB N="134" REF="77">
where the &s;cum or froth is that was fir&s;t taken off, and &s;o drink them both together. But this way is not held to be &s;o good, as cau&s;ing ob|&s;ructions and windine&s;s in the &s;tomach: whereas the effects of <HI>Chocolatte</HI> well tempered and moderately taken, are &s;aid to be, that it fortifyeth and comforts the &s;tomach; which at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in many per&s;ons, is fre|quently &s;ubject to a <HI>Cachexia,</HI> or fainting &s;ome hours after meale, whether it be from any peculiar indi&s;po&s;ition of the Aire or Cli|mate, or from &s;om natural weaknes and in&s;oli|dity in the food or dyet of the Countrie; which though it be for the mo&s;t part lu&s;cious tooth|&s;ome and plea&s;ing in the palate, in what kinde &s;oever it be, whether of fle&s;h, fi&s;h or fruits, yet is it not held to be of &s;o &s;trong and &s;olid nutri|ment, as the dyet of <HI>Europe</HI> generally is. It is &s;aid likewi&s;e to revive and exhilerate the &s;pirits very much, to help concoction, to make lu&s;ty and corpulent, and may be well taken three times a day, in the morning, a little before dinner, and &s;ome three or four hours after, but very moderately, and never exceeding one rea&s;ona|ble draught at a time: and a if man hath occa&s;i|on to watch, or &s;it up late, it will help him very much to take one cup of it more about eight or nine a clock at night.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="135" REF="77">3. Now as for <HI>Atolle,</HI> of which I &s;pake even now, it is a drink of it &s;elf very delicious, made of the juyce of the young <HI>Maiz,</HI> or Indian Wheat, much like unto Almond milke, but &s;omwhat thicker, and &s;o confectioned with Sugar, Spices, Musk and other ingredients of the Countrie, that it is not onely of Admira|ble &s;weetne&s;s, both for the ta&s;te and &s;mell, but much more nutritive and comfortable to the &s;tomach; and would doubtle&s;s be accounted a rare dtink in <HI>Europe,</HI> if it would endure the Sea, or could be tran&s;ported thence, but that it will not: whereas <HI>Chocolatte,</HI> or <HI>Cacao,</HI> made up in boxes, as we &s;aid, is &s;ent abroad into <HI>Spain, Flanders, Italy,</HI> and many other parts of the World. The Commoner &s;ort of Indians have another kinde of drink, which they call <HI>Chica,</HI> a helli&s;h &s;lap, and &s;uch, as if it had but &s;ome good quantity of Hen-bane ad|ded to the Toade, which they commonly put into it, and &s;teep him there till he be dead and quite con&s;umed, would be a draught fitter for the Devill than a Chri&s;tian. They take a great Jarre or ve&s;&s;el of the &s;ort of tho&s;e which u&s;u|ally they have from <HI>Spain,</HI> and put in &s;ome certain quantity of water, filling up the re&s;t with <HI>Mela&s;&s;os,</HI> or the juyce of Sugar Canes, and &s;ometimes a little Honey: And be&s;ide
<PB N="136" REF="78">
the&s;e, to give it a &s;trength agreeable to their Palats that drink it, they put in good &s;tore of the roots and leaves of Tobacco, and of &s;eve|rall other roots of the Countrie, of &s;trong and violent operation, adding to all, the bigge&s;t and blacke&s;t toad they can finde: and having &s;o done, they clo&s;e up the Jarre, and let it &s;tand for the &s;pace of three weeks or a moneth, till all the ingredients be throughly &s;teeped and con&s;umed; after which, they drink it. And though, for the mo&s;t part, at the fir&s;t opening of the Jarre, it gives a &s;ent that a &s;tranger hath much adoe to indure, yet the Indians love it and drink it exce&s;&s;ively, having many great meetings onely to drink <HI>Chica;</HI> and mo&s;t com|monly they carow&s;e &s;o long at it, that they are all of them not onely drunk, which is u&s;ual with them, but even raging mad with it; in|&s;omuch that the Spani&s;h Officers and Magi|&s;trates among them labor what they can to prohibit &s;uch meetings, but all in vain; cu|&s;tome and the naturall inclination of the Americans to drink and &s;will very much, hi|therto prevailing again&s;t their endeavors. I am not ignorant that &s;ome Authors give a better character of a certain drink at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> under the name of <HI>Chica;</HI> nor can I &s;ay which of them it is, that hath mi&s;taken the name: This
<PB N="137" REF="78">
I am &s;ure, the Author whom I follow, pre|tends to be an eye witne&s;s, and to have &s;een with his eyes that which he reports of the thing it &s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> the quality of the drink, and manner of drinking it by the Indians: which in truth &s;eems to me to be but a relique of their old barbarity and &s;avagene&s;s; and there|fore I &s;hall &s;peak no more of it.</P>

commented upon by <HI>Nardus Anto|nius Recchus</HI> and Italian, <HI>Joannes Terrentius,</HI> and others: proceeding my &s;elf to give &s;ome briefe account concerning the Cattel, and &s;uch other Bea&s;ts of <HI>America,</HI> as may &s;eem mo&s;t worthy of our knowledge. We have &s;aid be|fore, that the Cattel of <HI>Europe,</HI> which have been tran&s;ported thither, have thriven aboun|dantly, and multiplyed into &s;uch incredible numbers, as well Kine or great Cattle, as tho&s;e of the le&s;&s;er &s;ort, <HI>viz.</HI> Sheep, Hoggs, Goats, &amp;c. that Swine, and al&s;o great Cattel in the I&s;lands, e&s;pecially of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and in many parts of the Continent be&s;ide, live wilde in heards upon the Mountains, and may be killed by any body that will take the pains to doe it. Yea, they &s;ay that the very doggs which the Spaniards carried over, and which did them not a little &s;ervice, when time was, again&s;t the naked Indians, have multiplyed &s;o exceedingly, that they goe al&s;o in companies, like other wilde Bea&s;ts, up and down the Countrie, and are one of the greate&s;t inconveniencies to w^c^h the Countrie of <HI>America</HI> is &s;ubject, for the mi&s;chief that they doe to their Sheep and other &s;mall Cattel, being become almo&s;t as ravenous and bad as &s;o many Wolves, and &s;eem to be little le&s;s than metamorphiz'd into Wolves,
<PB N="139" REF="79">
by their wild and mountainous breeding, and by rea&s;on of a &s;trange fiercene&s;s which they have contracted by &s;uch breeding and living. So as the Spaniards that brought them thither, are forced to keep guard, and to maintain, as it were, a <HI>defen&s;ive warre</HI> again&s;t their own Creatures. Neverthele&s;s in the mo&s;t inland Countries of <HI>America,</HI> where the Spaniards live and many hundreds of leagues from the Sea, or any part of the I&s;lands, there is &s;o great plenty of fle&s;h-meat, that for a Ryall of plate, which is but &s;ix pence Engli&s;h money, a man may buy thirteen or fourteen pound weight of the be&s;t Beef, Mutton, or Pork, in the Market, of an <HI>Obligado</HI> (as they call him) or &s;ome of his Deputies, who are men appointed and bound, as we &s;aid before, to &s;erve &s;uch a Citie, Town, or Place, with fle&s;h meat, at a certain rate, all the year long. So that omitting to &s;peak any thing more concerning forein or European Cattel at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak onely, and that very briefly, of &s;uch Cat|tel, and other Creatures, as are more proper to the <HI>New World,</HI> &s;eem either mo&s;t worthy, or mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be known by us; beginning fir&s;t with tho&s;e of the Land.</P>
<P N="2">2. And among the Land Creatures of <HI>America,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Pacos,</HI> or Peruvian
<PB N="140" REF="80">
Sheep, as they commonly count and call them, may by right come in the fir&s;t place, being the mo&s;t profitable Cattel of the Countrie, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, of the World, affording the In|dians both meat, clothing, and &s;ervice. It is a Bea&s;t of a rea&s;onable good &s;tature, bigger than a Calfe, and &s;omewhat le&s;s than a Bullock of two year old, and bears a burthen, for the mo&s;t part, of 150 pound weight, without the charge either of &s;addle or &s;hooing, as both Hor&s;e and Mules require, feeding onely upon &s;uch meat as they finde upon the roade; and in ca&s;e they finde none, travelling &s;ome dayes without either meat or water. There are two &s;orts of the&s;e <HI>Pacos;</HI> one that bears a good fleece of wooll; the other &s;mooth and bare, yet &s;omewhat the &s;tronger of the two for bur|then. They have long necks like a Camel, and are of diver&s;e colours, white, black, grey, and &s;potted. Their fle&s;h is likewi&s;e very good meat, e&s;pecially while they are young, and of their young ones, which is &s;aid to be the ten|dere&s;t and mo&s;t delicate that can be eaten, though they kill not many of them by rea&s;on of their nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice, and &s;o great plenty of other meat. But of their wooll they make &s;e|veral &s;orts of cloath; one more gro&s;s and com|mon: the other very fine, which they call
<PB N="141" REF="80">
<HI>Cumbi;</HI> and &s;erveth for Carpets, Coverings, and many other u&s;es, la&s;ting long, and having, a good lu&s;tre, and (which is &s;omewhat more curious) woven on both &s;ides alike, without difference. They drive the&s;e <HI>Pacos</HI> in troops, &s;ometimes four or five hundred of them to|gether, or more, laden with Merchandi&s;e, Wine, <HI>Maiz, Coca,</HI> Quick-&s;ilver, and Silver in Barrs, which they carrie from the Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> as far as <HI>Ariqua,</HI> upon the South-Sea, which is about three&s;core or &s;eventy leagues, without any other Convoy or Guide, but one|ly of a few Indians to drive the Sheep, and &s;ome Spaniards to over&s;ee the Indians. They indure fro&s;t and cold naturally, as having been bred, and thriving be&s;t upon the <HI>Sierra</HI> and <HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Peru;</HI> where they are &s;een many times covered with ice and &s;now, yet never &s;hrinking at it; whereas in the Planes and hot Countrie they dye. They are in truth a ve|ry &s;erviceable and good Creature, yet not without &s;ome odd qualities, which the Reader, mu&s;t know, e&s;pecially that &s;ort of them which are &s;mooth and bear no fleece. If they meet a &s;tranger by the way, they will many times &s;ud|denly &s;tand &s;till, and rai&s;ing up their long necks as high as they can, &s;tare and gaze upon him &s;o wi&s;tly, as will make a man laugh not a little to
<PB N="142" REF="81">
&s;ee it, and with &s;uch a confidence as if he feared nothing; yet all on the &s;udden a fright takes him, and away he runs with his load upon his back, and commonly &s;o fa&s;t that his driver is hardly able to recover him before he hath gained &s;ome high rock or Mountain, where the Indian either cannot or dare not follow him for the precipice; and from hence nothing will command him but a Harquebuz, which they are oftentimes forced to u&s;e, onely to get the Silver again, that is upon his back. They have likewi&s;e another quality not a little trou|ble&s;ome; which is to grow re&s;ty, and lye down under their burthens: though this be but &s;el|dome, and, as they &s;ay, never but when they are laden or driven beyond ordinary. But if the fit once take him, there is no other remedy but to have patience to &s;it down by him, make on him, and let him take his own time to ri&s;e; which, after a while, he will doe of him&s;elf: but to &s;tir or &s;trive with him before, is to no purpo&s;e; for though you beat him never &s;o much, or kill him, or cut him in a thou&s;and peeces, all will not make him move a foot: but by bearing him company, and treating him fairely, after two or three hours re&s;t he will ri&s;e and goe on his journey as willingly as can be. They are commonly e&s;timated at five or

&s;ix peeces of <HI>A&s;&s;ay,</HI> which may be about four|ty &s;hillings Engli&s;h money; and at the Indies he that hath but four or five of the&s;e <HI>Pacos</HI> to travel withall &amp; carrie Merchandi&s;e from place to place, will not count him&s;elf a poor man.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Vicugnes</HI> are a kinde of wilde Goats, but much bigger than the ordinary Goats of <HI>Europe,</HI> and without hornes, otherwi&s;e coated and haired like Goats.

They goe commonly in heards or great companies to|gether, being exceeding fearfull Creatures, and withall very light of foot. Anciently the hunting of them was forbidden to the common People, and re&s;erved onely to the <HI>Inguas</HI> and Lords of <HI>Peru:</HI> now 'tis generally u&s;ed, when&s;oever they are found in the low|lands. They are of a dark brown colour, not much unlike to dryed Ro&s;es, &amp; bear a fleece of a long &s;haggie haire, yet &s;o fine that the Indians make rugs and coverings of it, of great value. Their fle&s;h is counted the mo&s;t dainty &s;ort of Veni&s;on, and in &s;ome ca&s;es medicinal: yea the Indians have an opinion that the very Quilts
<PB N="144" REF="82">
and Coverings made of the wooll or haire of the <HI>Vicugnes,</HI> are good again&s;t the inflammation of the reins, and for the tempering of all ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat; nor is it improbable. For con&s;i|dering what kinde of Pa&s;turage this bea&s;t doth naturally delight in, and for the mo&s;t part live by, which is more than half fro&s;t and &s;now, it may well be thought, that not only their fle&s;h, but every thing el&s;e that proceeds naturally of their &s;ub&s;tance, &s;hould in &s;ome degree be re|frigerative, and retain &s;ome cooling vertue in it. Of the fle&s;h there is no di&s;pute to be made, but that it is very &s;overaign and good in all &s;uch ca&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> of inflammations and immode|rate heat. <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> gives a notable in&s;tance of it in him&s;elf; who having travelled &s;o long upon the <HI>Andes</HI> and tho&s;e cold mountains of <HI>Peru,</HI> that his eyes were inflamed with the exce&s;&s;ive &s;harpne&s;s of the Aire, and become &s;o painfull to him, that they &s;eemed ready to drop out of his head, onely by rubbing them lightly with a piece of the raw fle&s;h of the <HI>Vicugne,</HI> the pain was pre&s;ently a&s;&s;waged, and his eyes in &s;hort time reduced to good temper. Nor is this the onely good they have by this Bea&s;t; for out of his &s;tomach, when he is kild, they take likewi&s;e the Bezar &s;tone, true and good, and &s;car&s;e any way inferiour to that of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="82">
which, as 'tis well known, is a &s;tone of rare vertue, e&s;pecially in way of Antidote again&s;t any &s;orts of poi&s;on, in all pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;es, and likewi&s;e the infirmities of deep Melancho|lie. They finde it commonly of the bigne&s;s of a wallnut; &s;ometimes of an Hens egge, or an Orange; but the&s;e are rare.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is al&s;o at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> another Bea&s;t, which they call <HI>Tarugne,</HI> not much un|like to the <HI>Vicugne;</HI> but bigger of body, and likewi&s;e of a &s;wifter pace. The&s;e live not in companies, as the <HI>Vicugnes</HI> doe, but &s;olitary and &s;ingle, and carrie their eares hanging down, whereas tho&s;e of the <HI>Vicugne</HI> are erect and &s;tand up: in other re&s;pects they much re|&s;emble the <HI>Vicugne,</HI> yeelding likewi&s;e the Be|zar &s;tone, as the <HI>Vicugne</HI> doth; and which, though it be not altogether &s;o big, yet is thought to be much better in vertue and ope|ration than the other. There are Bezar &s;tones likewi&s;e taken very often out of the <HI>Pacos;</HI> but tho&s;e are le&s;s, not ordinarily above the bigne&s;s of an ha&s;ell nut, or Filberd; and whe|ther &s;o perfect and true in kinde, or no, as the other, I cannot &s;ay. The <HI>Taurus Mexica|nus,</HI> as &s;ome Authors call him, and we mu&s;t Engli&s;h, the <HI>American Bull,</HI> or <HI>Steere,</HI> is ano|ther &s;trange Bea&s;t at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> &s;trange
<PB N="146" REF="83">
I call them in re&s;pect of our &s;elves, and the&s;e parts of the World; for otherwi&s;e they are no way &s;trange, being common at <HI>America,</HI> e&s;pecially in the more Northern parts of it, and of no very mon&s;trous or deformed &s;hape. They re&s;emble the Oxe of <HI>Europe</HI> only a little in the head, and not otherwi&s;e; being not only of a far le&s;s &s;ize than the ordinary Oxe or Bullock, but al&s;o of a &s;tature &s;omewhat with the lowe&s;t, even in proportion to their own bulke; having a good big full bodie, of the &s;ize of &s;ome le&s;&s;er &s;ort of Cows, but very &s;hort leggs to bear it; yet we may well count them the natural and proper Kine of <HI>Ameri|ca.</HI> They are of a bright brown colour, or if you plea&s;e, of a dark yellow, &s;uch as the Itali|ans call <HI>il colore lionato,</HI> having a thick long hair curled all over their bodie, which at a di|&s;tance makes them appear &s;omewhat terrible and horrid, but coming neerer them, their countenance &s;eems rather cheerful and plea|&s;ing; neither have they any truculency or fiercene&s;s of condition, but are as tractable and ea&s;ily maniable as other Cattel. On their backs they have a little ri&s;ing or bunch, like a Camel, though I doe not ob&s;erve that they are any where u&s;ed for burthen, like the Camel. They breed and abound mo&s;t in the
<PB N="147" REF="83">
Province of <HI>Quivira,</HI> which is a plain level Countrie in the Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> affording little el&s;e but pa&s;turage; and from hence they are had into other parts, being the cheif wealth of this Countrie, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the People; who chiefly live upon this Cattel, feeding huge multitudes of them in Heards up and down the Countrie, as their pa&s;ture leads them, u&s;ing their fle&s;h for meat, which is very good, and making a drink of their blood.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet is their another &s;ort of &s;mal Cattel rec|koned for Kine at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> which they call <HI>Dantes,</HI> but in their figure and &s;hape more re&s;embling Mules than Kine; neither have they any horns. The hides of the&s;e Bea&s;ts are much u&s;ed by the Indians for Jerkins, or a kinde of upper Garment, which is as good as &s;ome Ar|mor for them, it being &s;o thick and hard, as it is &s;aid to re&s;i&s;t any weapon that the Indians u&s;e: like to the <HI>Armadillos</HI> (as the Spaniards call them) which are likewi&s;e another kinde of Bea&s;ts proper to the <HI>New World,</HI> much le&s;&s;er than the <HI>Dantes,</HI> yet covered all over the body, as it were, with a Coat of Maile, that is, with a &s;calie hard skin, which &s;he opens and &s;huts at plea&s;ure, and thereby both covers and defends her &s;elf upon occa&s;ion. The fle&s;h of this Bea&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="84">
is eaten by &s;ome, but not &s;o generally com|mended for good meat. The <HI>Saynos</HI> are a kinde of Hogge or Swine of <HI>America,</HI> a wilde and fierce Creature, and in this re&s;pect &s;ome|what more &s;trange, that their Navil is &s;aid to be on the mid&s;t of their back. They are armed likewi&s;e on their feet with talons, &s;o &s;harp that a Ra&s;or will not pierce fa&s;ter or further then they, and with them they doe u&s;ually teare and wound &s;uch as pur&s;ue them, very dangerou&s;ly, e&s;pecially if they have not good care and skil in hunting them. The fle&s;h of them, when they are taken, is counted good meat; but to keep it, the Navil in the back of it mu&s;t be taken quickly out, otherwi&s;e it will pu|trifie in a few dayes. The <HI>Chincelles</HI> are a kinde of Squirrel, of a wonderfull &s;oft and &s;mooth hair, the skin whereof is thought to be very comfortable to the &s;tomach in any &s;udden pain or fainting, and affordeth a delicate kinde of Furre, much u&s;ed and e&s;teemed by the better &s;ort. The <HI>Vi&s;cachas</HI> and <HI>Cuyos</HI> are the Hares and Conies of <HI>America,</HI> of much bigger &s;ize than the&s;e of <HI>Europe,</HI> and are hunted there likewi&s;e for &s;port, as here, and their fle&s;h counted not the wor&s;t &s;ort of Veni&s;on. The <HI>Micos,</HI> or Monkies of <HI>America,</HI> are many and of &s;everal kindes; &s;ome whereof are &s;aid
<PB N="149" REF="84">
not to be much le&s;s than the body of a little man, and al&s;o bearded under their chaps as venerably as any Goat. They de&s;cribe a cer|tain kinde of them in <HI>Peru</HI> with long tailes, and commonly of thrice the bigne&s;s of an or|dinarie Ape, of diver&s;e colours, <HI>viz.</HI> black, grey, bay, and &s;potted; and report many pret|ty &s;tories of them; which, if true, argue them to be extreamly ingenious, and to have, at lea&s;t, &s;ome <HI>traites de vi&s;age,</HI> as they &s;ay, or re&s;em|blances of rea&s;on. This is common with them; when they have minde to any fruit upon a tree, they get pre&s;ently up, and winding their taile about the bough, with the weight of their bodie &s;hake as much fruit off it as they think fit. Of another it is &s;aid, that &s;eeing a Souldi|er level at him with his Musket, he &s;natch't up a &s;tone, and before the Musket could be di&s;|charged, threw it at him and hit him full in the eye. <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> tells of another, which they com|monly &s;ent to the Tavern for wine, the pot in one hand and money in the other; which er|rand he would perform mo&s;t exactly, and with &s;uch di&s;cretion, that they mu&s;t be very rude with him, that &s;hould get the money out of the one hand, before his pot were filled and put into the other. The Boys in the &s;treet would throw &s;tones at him many times in
<PB N="150" REF="85">
&s;port, and he at them again, but never till he had fir&s;t &s;et down his pot; then he would lay about him with any thing next hand; nor would he offer to take up his pot again, till they &s;eem|ed to be quiet, and that his way was cleer: and if they gave it him, he would drink wine freely; but otherwi&s;e not &s;o much as touch it. There be al&s;o Lyons, Bears, Tygres, and other wilde Bea&s;ts of prey at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but neither &s;o great, nor &s;o ravenous as tho&s;e in other parts of the World. The Lyons in <HI>Ame|rica</HI> are rather grey than red or yellow, and have not that long &s;haggie haire on the fore-parts of their bodie, with which they are paint|ed. The Tygres are more fierce and cruel; but that is only when they are hungry, and &s;eek their prey: for otherwi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> when their bel|lies are full, if the report of <HI>Maffaeus</HI> be true in his <HI>hi&s;toria Indica,</HI> they are as fluggi&s;h and heavie a Bea&s;t as any, and may be both taken and killed by any body almo&s;t that will: But by his favour I will not be the fir&s;t that &s;hall make tryal. There is likewi&s;e aboundance of Staggs and wild Deer in all parts of the Con|tinent of <HI>America;</HI> but, for ought I know, in the I&s;lands there are none found.</P>
<P N="6">6. The&s;e are all Bea&s;ts and Creatures of the Land, with which, and infinite others, not
<PB N="151" REF="85">
here to be mentioned, the <HI>New World</HI> is aboun|dantly &s;tored: Nor doe the Waters afford le&s;s variety, either of Sea, or more within Land, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Lakes and Rivers, which are generally &s;o plentifully and well &s;tored with good fi&s;h, that there is no Countrie in the World comparable to <HI>America</HI> in that re&s;pect. Among&s;t the&s;e the <HI>Cayman,</HI> as they call him, or Indian Crocodile, as the mo&s;t prodigious and &s;trange, de&s;erves to be fir&s;t mentioned: yet is he an amphibious Creature, living as well, and perhaps as much upon Land as in the wa|ter. It is a mo&s;t fierce and ravenous Creature, of a va&s;t bulk or bigne&s;s, being &s;aid to be from the fore part of his &s;nout to the end of his tayle &s;even or eight yards long; and of &s;uch &s;trength, that he hath been &s;een to take up a living man, lying a&s;leep upon the &s;hore, in his mouth, and to carry him cleer away with him into the water, over to another I&s;land or Rock in the Sea, where he meant to have devoured him: But being &s;hot with a Caliver he lo&s;t his prey, and the man was recovered, but dyed &s;oon after. He &s;eeks his prey commonly upon Land, which he kills or drowns in the Water: yet cannot there eat it, by rea&s;on of &s;ome pe|culiar di&s;po&s;ition of his throat or gullet, which is &s;uch, as that it permits him not to &s;wal|low
<PB N="152" REF="86">
any thing in the water, but with hazard to &s;uffocate or drown him&s;elf. The be&s;t is, his motion by Land is but &s;low, and his body &s;o unweldy, that he cannot turn him&s;elf but with much adoe, nor his head to either &s;ide without turning his whole body. Yet doe they much mi&s;chief, e&s;pecially about &s;ome Rivers in the Provinces of <HI>Mechoacan</HI> and <HI>Tla&s;calla,</HI> where there are many of them. They &s;ay 'tis excellent &s;port to &s;ee a <HI>Cayman</HI> and a Tygre fight, as they happen to doe oftentimes, endeavouring to prey one upon another. The <HI>Cayman,</HI> with his taile, cruelly beats and jerks the Tygre, endeavouring what he can to hale him into the water. The Tygre as &s;toutly re&s;i&s;ts him with his paw, and labours to pull up the <HI>Cayman</HI> to land; which for the mo&s;t part he doth, and then opens him by the belly, which is the only part of him where he can be pier|ced; his whole body otherwi&s;e being armed with &s;cales &s;o extremely hard and thick &s;et, that no Lance, and &s;carcely an Harquebuz or Musket &s;hot will enter it. The Indians fear him not &s;o much by water as land: for being them&s;elves excellent Swimmers and Dyvers, and the <HI>Cayman</HI> alwaies &s;wimming above water, or very fleet, they make no great matter to encounter him hand to hand in his own
<PB N="153" REF="86">
element for they ea&s;ily get under his belly, and with their knives or &s;hort Lances pierce him there as they li&s;t, and &s;o bring him to Land.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Tyburons</HI> are a kinde of Shark-fi&s;h, of large &s;ize, and extremely ravenous. They are commonly ten or twelve foot long, and about &s;ix or &s;even &s;pans broad on the back, being fa&s;hioned like a Soale, with huge wide mouths, and two rows of teeth on each &s;ide of their mouth very &s;harp and thick &s;et, and of &s;o great &s;trength, that at one &s;natch or jerk, they will break the bones or pluck a&s;under the joints of any Bea&s;t what&s;oever: They follow the &s;hips at Sea willingly, for the wa&s;h and other &s;tuff which the Mariners ca&s;t out to them, being &s;o ravenous that they re|ceive everything. <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> reporteth, that out of the gullet of one of them, he &s;aw taken at the &s;ame time a great Butchers knife, a long iron hook, and a piece of a Cows head, with one horn &s;till growing upon it. Others tell of Hats, whole Shirts, Leggs and Arms of Men, ropes ends, with many other things of like na|ture found in the &s;ame manner. Yet is the fle&s;h of them counted very good meat, when they are well dryed, and a principall reliefe in ma|ny occa&s;ions at Sea; where they are taken without much difficultie, and &s;o bigge, that
<PB N="154" REF="87">
many times ten or twelve men have &s;omewhat to doe to pull one of them up, when they have him upon the hook. They come likewi&s;e out of the Sea up into the rivers, as the <HI>Caymans</HI> doe, and are exceeding dangerous both to men and cattell, that are not aware of them, or happen to ly or &s;leep upon the banks of any great river, as in <HI>America</HI> it is not unu&s;uall to doe. At Sea they are commonly attended by a &s;maller &s;ort of fi&s;h which they call <HI>Rambos,</HI> which lives by the meat that falls from the <HI>Tyburon,</HI> as the <HI>Jaccall</HI> is &s;aid to doe by the Lion.</P>
<P N="8">8. The <HI>Manati,</HI> or <HI>Oxe-fi&s;h,</HI> as &s;ome call them, is another great fi&s;h of the Sea, bigger by farre than the <HI>Tyburon,</HI> headed like an Oxe or young heifer, with two armes, or at lea&s;t &s;tumpes of armes on each &s;ide before, and tho&s;e as &s;ome &s;ay, di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;everall joynts with nailes upon them, not unlike to tho&s;e of a mans hand. This is a gentle and harmele&s;s creature, and though of bulk or body not le&s;s than a young Oxe or Bullock, yet neither of any feirce or horrid a&s;pect, but rather amiable and cleerer countenanced, as the figure of it in <HI>Hernandez,</HI> and <HI>Laet</HI> &s;heweth. It cometh fre|quently upon land, and feeds upon hearbs or gra&s;&s;e, if there be any neer; and being at Sea it &s;wimes commonly above water and is ea&s;ily
<PB N="155" REF="87">
taken. 'Tis counted for meat the be&s;t fi&s;h in the World, being as tender and delicate as any veale, or the be&s;t young porke; and &s;o like it, that a &s;tranger would verily take it for veale, which it re&s;embles &s;o much every way, both for colour and ta&s;te, that it hath been di&s;puted and que&s;tioned by &s;ome whither it might be eaten on fa&s;ting dayes; for that it both eateth hearbs and gra&s;&s;e, re&s;embles fle&s;h &s;o much, and bea|reth its young alive, &s;uckling them with milk by certain teats which they have, as other Land creatures doe. They finde in the head of it a certain Stone, or hard congelated Sub|&s;tance, which being ground to powder, they &s;ay is very good for the &s;tone in the reins, and to provoke urine, e&s;pecially that which is found in the male-fi&s;h.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Tortoi&s;e</HI> is a Fi&s;h yet greater than any of the&s;e before &s;poken of, <HI>viz.</HI> than the <HI>Tybu|ron</HI> or the <HI>Manati,</HI> and upon the Shores of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> every where, there are great multi|tudes of them found. The&s;e are a Shell-fi&s;h of figure and &s;hape round, carrying their hou&s;e or cover, alwayes upon their back, and by con|&s;equence moving but &s;lowly. They take them &s;ometimes at Sea with Nets made for that pur|po&s;e only, but mo&s;t commonly on the Shore, whither they frequently re&s;ort in huge multi|tudes,
<PB N="156" REF="88">
cheifly to lay their egges, which in the &s;and are hatched with incredible increa&s;e, onely by the heat of the Sun: and though they make all the ha&s;te they can to Sea again, a&s;&s;oon as ever they perceive any body, yet they are ea&s;ily overtaken, and by turning them with a &s;taffe or pole, upon their backs, which is not hard for them to doe that are acquainted with the manner of hunting <HI>Tortoi&s;es;</HI> two or three men will &s;tay and take a whole company of them. They are commonly a yard and a quar|ter at lea&s;t in length, and &s;ometime more than twice &s;o much in breadth, and of &s;uch bigne&s;s &amp; weight, that it will ordinarily require &s;ix or &s;e|ven &s;tout men to draw one of them out of the water; and &s;carce any found &s;o little, but it will lode two or three men to carry it hand|&s;omely away when it is cut in pieces. The fle&s;h of them is very excellent good meat, when it is well powdred, and of no le&s;&s;e plea&s;ant ta&s;te. E|very <HI>Tortoi&s;e</HI> layeth commonly two or three hundred egges at a time, as big as Hens egges, but round like a ball: good likewi&s;e to eate, and have this propertie, that whither boiled or ro&s;ted, the white of them is alwaies &s;oft. When the young ones are hatcht, they naturally make to Sea, never expecting that the old one &s;hould come to feed them. To this the Tyde helps
<PB N="157" REF="88">
them very much, and there they live and thrive &s;o well, that, as they &s;ay, &s;ome one of them hath been found of that bigne&s;s and weight, that 20. men had much adoe to lift it from the ground.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is, be&s;ides the&s;e, infinite variety of other kindes of fi&s;h in the Indian or American Seas; as the <HI>Iguana,</HI> which is a kinde of wa|ter-Serpent, of &s;omewhat a terrible and ugly forme, but otherwi&s;e not at all hurtfull; of the bigne&s;s commonly of an Otter or Fox, the skyn &s;potted and &s;mooth, and the fle&s;h neither unwhole&s;ome nor unplea&s;ant meat. And the <HI>Bobo,</HI> which is a gallant fi&s;h as any belong to the Seas, of the length of a mans arme, having one only bone or gri&s;tly &s;ub&s;tance running through the mid&s;t of it from end to end: it is of a mo&s;t tender and delicate &s;ub&s;tance, white as milk, and as fat as butter; excellent meat which way &s;oever dre&s;&s;ed, boyl'd, bak'd, &s;tew'd, roa&s;ted, or otherwi&s;e: And be&s;ide the&s;e many others, which I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s over in &s;ilence; as likewi&s;e I might well doe the&s;e that follow, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Niguas</HI> (as the Spaniards call them) or We&s;t-Indian Nits; and the <HI>Broma,</HI> or water-worme, two little In&s;ects indeed, and hardly to be numbred in the rank of perfect Creatures, yet &s;uch as make them&s;elves con|&s;iderable enough to be named, only by their
<PB N="158" REF="89">
trouble&s;omne&s;s; the one to Men at Land, the other to the &s;hips at Seas. The <HI>Niguas</HI> are &s;o &s;mall a kinde of vermine, that they can hardly be perceived &s;ingle, nothing neer &s;o bigge as a Flea, which lodge them&s;elves in&s;en&s;ibly and unperceived at fir&s;t, under the nails of Mens fingers and toes, and in other private parts of the body, and multiply in a &s;hort time &s;o &s;trangely, that they turn the party to extream pain and torture, and not &s;eldome cau&s;e him to lo&s;e a joint either of his hands or feet: Nor is it ea&s;ie to prevent their breeding, without continuall bru&s;hing of cloaths and a great care to keep all things about a man, as much as can be, clean and dry. When they are perceived to be bred, the be&s;t remedy is counted to be, to pour melted wax upon the place where they are ne&s;tled; which, though it &s;calds and be trouble&s;ome for the time, yet when it is cold, it brings away a &s;hoale of that little vermin with it, &s;ometimes four or five hundred of them at a pull. A cheap remedy indeed, if it be &s;o effectual as they &s;ay. The <HI>Broma,</HI> or water-worm, is no le&s;s trouble&s;ome and mi&s;chievous to the &s;hips at Sea: it is found generally in all parts within the Tropiques or Torrid Zone, and more e&s;pecially neer the Line: The Engli&s;h call it &s;ometimes <HI>Arters,</HI> from what ground
<PB N="159" REF="89">
I am not able to &s;ay; but the inconvenience and danger which it brings to &s;hips, if not pre|vented, is apparent and great. They fa&s;ten commonly in &s;uch great multitudes, upon the planks of a &s;hip, e&s;pecially betwixt winde and water, where it is not le&s;s dangerous, that the &s;hips many times are found covered with them very thick in tho&s;e parts, and the planks under water wrought like Hony-combs, full of a num|ber of little cells or cavities, which the worms make in them, and in time eate through the planks, be they never &s;o thick, and endanger the &s;hip. They are at fir&s;t as little as a pins head or le&s;s, but grow in time to the bigne&s;s of a Mans little finger; and the further they work into a plank, the bigger likewi&s;e they grow. And therefore to prevent the inconveniences that would otherwi&s;e certainly befall the &s;hips that goe to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> they u&s;ually &s;heath them, as they call it, before they goe out, that is, they naile or fa&s;ten upon the ribs of the &s;hips, under water, and betwixt winde and water &s;ometimes thin &s;heats of lead, &s;ome|times double planks of good thickne&s;s, both within and without. But neither of the&s;e wayes are counted good; partly by rea&s;on of the overmuch weight or balla&s;t, which they give to the &s;hip; and partly for that they en|dure
<PB N="160" REF="90">
not; for the worm ea&s;ily works through the planks, be they never &s;o thick; and the lead being very thin, wa&s;heth away, and in time decayes &s;o much, that the worm will not be hindred from entring. Others burn the outermo&s;t planks of the &s;hip, under wa|ter and above, to the blackne&s;s of a coal, and then pitch it all over with pitch: This doth rea&s;onable well. But the be&s;t remedie of all, and that which is now mo&s;t generally u&s;ed, is that which is &s;aid to be the Invention of Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> a Gentleman in his time of great experience and command at Sea. They take the &s;heathing-board, which they intend to lay on, and be&s;meare all the in&s;ide of it with Tarre, half a finger thick at lea&s;t, and upon the Tarre another half finger thick of hair, &s;uch as is commonly u&s;ed in Morter; and then nayle it down on the ribs of the &s;hip, &s;o far as they judge it nece&s;&s;ary, driving the nails rea&s;onably thick, never above a &s;pan di&s;tance one from another. This is thought both the cheape&s;t and &s;ecure&s;t way: For the Tarre either killeth the worm, as &s;ome think; or at lea&s;t, when &s;he is wrought through the &s;heathing-board, the Tarre and hair together &s;o involve and choak her up, that &s;he is not able to pa&s;s fur|ther, but there &s;tops and dyeth: And the

thinner the &s;heathing-board is, &s;o much the better.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Sugar-Canes, Cotton-wooll, Mulberry trees, and Silk-worms, at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. AMong the Commodities of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> which we call Mercantile, or &s;uch as the Merchants bring from thence, the Sugars are not to be e&s;teemed the lea&s;t, whether we regard the aboundance, or great plenty of the Commoditie it &s;elf that is brought, or the extraordinary gain and profit they make that bring it; it being become &s;uch a general in&s;trument of deliciou&s;ne&s;s to all &s;orts of People, in all Nations, and &s;o exceed|ingly agreeable to dainty palats. 'Tis &s;aid, they buy a pound of good Sugar at the Indies for five or &s;ix Maravedes, which make not two pence of Engli&s;h monie; and in &s;ome places a hundred pound weight together for nine or ten Ryals of plate, which are not above five &s;hillings; whereas with us in <HI>Europe,</HI> the rate of it is far otherwi&s;e. Some &s;ay it is no
<PB N="162" REF="91">
Plant of the natural growth of <HI>America,</HI> but brought thither from other parts, as namely from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> or <HI>Canarie</HI> I&s;lands; which &s;eems rather to be a mi&s;take, con&s;ide|ring the great aboundance thereof which groweth naturally, without any kinde of plant|ing or Husbandrie, in all parts of <HI>Bra&s;il, Para|guay, Tucuman,</HI> and diver&s;e other Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> both of the Continent and I&s;lands; in&s;omuch that in &s;ome place about the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> they report, that the Canes grow to the height of &s;ome le&s;&s;er trees, yeelding a pro|portionable quantity of good Sugar in every joint or knot of the Cane. For originally, and at fir&s;t, we mu&s;t know, this delicious powder, which we call Sugar, is nothing el&s;e but the pith or &s;weet marrow of a certain Cane or Reed, which the Latins call <HI>Saccharum,</HI> bor|rowing the term, as 'tis thought, from the Arabicks, together with the fir&s;t knowledge of the Plant, and we commonly the <HI>Sugar-Cane.</HI> It groweth in the manner of other reeds up into a long &s;talk, with joynts and knots in it, commonly &s;even or eight foot high, and where the Soile is lu&s;ty and proper for it &s;ome|times more; of the bigne&s;s of a Mans arme in the brawn, and &s;harping up towards the top as it groweth. The joints, or knots, of the
<PB N="163" REF="91">
Cane, are, for the mo&s;t part, three or four in|ches di&s;tant one from another, and within full of a &s;pongeous and &s;weet juycie &s;ub&s;tance or marrow, of which the Sugar (as we have it) is made. At every knot or joynt of the Cane, on each &s;ide, there groweth up a long leafe, &s;harp at the point, and in the fa&s;hion of a wing. The root of it is likewi&s;e long and large, and runneth not directly downward into the earth, but rather &s;loping, and creeping along under the uppermo&s;t cru&s;t of the ground; out of which at &s;everal places there &s;prout diver&s;e young Siens, or little Plants, which they cut away, both that they &s;hould not draw too much of the nutriment from the principal or mother-Plant, as al&s;o for that they &s;et them for increa&s;e, or a new &s;tock of reeds; And 'tis &s;aid to be a yeer and half commonly before a Plant of the Sugar-Cane comes to its full per|fection or growth. But I conceive that to be much according to the nature and condition of the Soile where they grow. For in <HI>Hi&s;pa|niola</HI> (where indeed the Soile is exceeding lu&s;ty and good) 'tis &s;aid they grow to a cubits height in le&s;s than two moneths &s;pace. The &s;ub&s;tance of the root is likewi&s;e very &s;weet and plea&s;ant, nothing &s;o hard or woody as the roots of &s;ome other Canes and Reeds be, but rather
<PB N="164" REF="92">
tender and &s;oft; and where the Soile is good and proper for them, one root will beare &s;ome|times twenty or thirty Canes; which in the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> is not unu&s;ual; but they never &s;uffer all of them to grow up for the rea&s;on above&s;aid. They grow both in the Plains and Hill Countrie. in a hot and moi&s;t Soile, and require extraordinary Husbanding, and e&s;pecially that the ground about them be kept clean, and free from annoyance either of weeds or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The manner of making the Sugar, is commonly thus. When the Reeds are full grown &amp; gathered, they cut or chop them into &s;mall peeces at fir&s;t with a knife, or &s;ome other fitting in&s;trument, and afterwards grinde, or break them into yet &s;maller, in certain huge <HI>Querns</HI> or Mills, which they have for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e <HI>Querns</HI> goe &s;ometimes with wheels, and are turned about by their Slaves, who tread and labour in them ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as the Turn-&s;pit Doggs doe in many places in <HI>England:</HI> Others there be that are drawn about with an Hor&s;e, or <HI>Bufalo:</HI> But the more general way now u&s;ed of late for grinding and brui&s;ing the Canes, is by water-Mills, which they finde to be far more quick and convenient, e&s;pecially where they have the
<PB N="165" REF="92">
opportunity of a good &s;tream. When the Cane is thus broken and pulverizated in &s;ome &s;ort, they put it in great Caldrons, or boyling ve&s;&s;els of Bra&s;s, with &s;ome quantity of pure water, and likewi&s;e a &s;trong lye, or water of a&s;hes made for that purpo&s;e; and &s;o boyle it, till all the &s;weetne&s;s be quite out of the Cane, or hard &s;ub&s;tance of the Reed, and transfu&s;ed into the liquor. When this is done, they take it out, and through a colatorie or &s;trayner they pre&s;s out the liquor into certain great Keelers, or ve&s;&s;els which they call <HI>Tangue;</HI> and afterwards boyle it again, with a le&s;s pro|portion of lye put to it: the effect of this lye is chiefly to rai&s;e the &s;cum, and thereby to help to clarifie and refine the Sugar, by &s;eparating of the &s;ediments and gro&s;&s;er parts of it from the pure. When they have boyled it to the con&s;i&s;tency or thickne&s;s of Honey, they &s;train it out again into other ve&s;&s;els, which they call <HI>Tachas,</HI> and boyl it again to a yet greater thickne&s;s and con&s;i&s;tencie, ever adding &s;ome quantitie of the afore&s;aid lye, and continually &s;tirring and &s;cumming it, as it boyleth. After this they take it out, and &s;et it to cool in cer|tain le&s;&s;er ve&s;&s;els which the Spaniards call <HI>Formae,</HI> or Plates, which contain not above the quantity of two or three pound weight of
<PB N="166" REF="93">
Sugar a piece. They are commonly made of earth, and perforated, or full of little holes at the bottom, through which the thinner or more liquid part of the Sugar droppeth into other ve&s;&s;els appointed to receive it. It &s;tand|eth commonly in the&s;e <HI>Formes</HI> or Plates about eight or ten dayes, both that it may be perfect|ly cooled, as likewi&s;e to ob&s;erve whether it be refined and purged of its &s;ediments &s;o fully as it ought: If it be not, they boyle it once again as before. When it is cold, it look|eth like &s;and, or &s;mall gravel of a dark brown|i&s;h colour, only it is &s;ofter in the hand, and crumbles not &s;o har&s;hly as &s;and doth. The way to make it white, is by a certain peculiar earth, or <HI>Marle,</HI> they u&s;e, which, being fir&s;t di&s;&s;olved in water, and wrought into a kinde of &s;oft clay; they &s;pread it upon the Sugar, as it lyeth in the <HI>Formes</HI> or Plates, and in time it brings it to a white colour, yet more or le&s;s perfect, according as the Sugar it &s;elf is pure and fine. And now it is fit for the Merchants, who tran&s;port it into all parts of <HI>Europe:</HI> where, by the Sugar-bakers Art and skill, it is yet more accurately purged and refined: but of this I cannot &s;ay much. It is a Merchan|di&s;e of incredible wealth and advantage to the Countrie; it being no unu&s;ual thing for
<PB N="167" REF="93">
&s;ome one Sugar-Mill, or <HI>Ingenio,</HI> as they call it, to afford a revenue of thirty or fourty thou&s;and <HI>Pezos</HI> every yeer: and though it be likewi&s;e brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies, China,</HI> and other parts, yet is it not more plentifull in any Countrie of the World, than in <HI>America,</HI> where the Cane grows and thriveth well in all Provinces generally, but mo&s;t kindly in hot and moi&s;t Countries; in&s;omuch that in &s;ome of the I&s;lands they count an <HI>Ingenio,</HI> or good Sugar-Farm, to be no le&s;s profitable than &s;ome of their mines of Gold and Silver. 'Tis &s;aid, that out of the only I&s;land of Saint <HI>Domingo,</HI> or <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> they tran&s;port commonly one year with another, about a thou&s;and che&s;ts of refined Sugar, be&s;ide that of the cour&s;er &s;ort; every che&s;t containing eight or ten <HI>Arrobes</HI> at lea&s;t, which is twenty five pound weight, according to Engli&s;h account, and likewi&s;e proportionably from other parts.</P>
<P N="3">3. Cotton-wooll (as they call it, from the likene&s;s it hath to our ordinary wooll of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> e&s;pecially as to matter of u&s;e) is another very profitable and good commoditie of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> Though we call it wooll yet, is it the fruit of a tree, at lea&s;t of a &s;hrub or le&s;&s;er Plant, and groweth upon it in the manner of Apples or other fruit. It groweth, as I &s;aid,
<PB N="168" REF="94">
&s;ometimes upon trees, as particularly in the I&s;land of <HI>Puna</HI> in the South Sea, and in <HI>Hi&s;pa|niola,</HI> but for the mo&s;t part upon certain le&s;&s;er &s;hrubs or Plants, not much above a cubit high from the ground, or at mo&s;t not above the height of a man at the middle. The &s;ub&s;tance of the Plant whereon it groweth, is very hard and wooddie, and no le&s;s thick &s;et with &s;prigs and branches growing out of it from below, or but little above ground; which, in time are all beautified and covered, as it were, with a purple colour'd flower, yet about the edges, and below at the &s;talk, yellow; after which ap|pears the fruit in a round cod or hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">k, of dif|ferent bigne&s;s, according as the Soile is good and proper. If the Soile be warm and very lu&s;ty, they are commonly of the bigne&s;s of or|dinary Apples, or Quinces; if otherwi&s;e, le&s;s: When the fruit is ripe, the cod opens of it &s;elf, dividing into four quarters, and the matter within it appears; which is nothing el&s;e but a &s;oft gentle &s;ub&s;tance, much re&s;embling wooll in the touch, lying clo&s;e, and well wrapt to|gether in the cod: it groweth &s;till, that is, after the cod is opened, to the bigne&s;s of a mans fi&s;t ordinarily, and then, unle&s;s it be ga|thered by &s;ome body, it &s;heds it &s;elf upon the ground, as the Down-Thi&s;tle commonly doth,
<PB N="169" REF="94">
together with its &s;eed, which is a little round black &s;ub&s;tance of the bigne&s;s of Conies tret|tles, or &s;ome le&s;&s;er &s;ort of Pea&s;e, but flat. This is the &s;eed of the Cotton; and they gather it con&s;tantly, and &s;ow it every year, in the &s;ame manner as they doe other Grain, <HI>viz.</HI> upon tilled Land, and in furrows; and in harve&s;t they reap their crop, which they have never above once upon the &s;ame &s;talk or Plant.</P>
<P N="4">4. This woolly &s;ub&s;tance of the Cotton-Apple, when it is gathered, the Indian women card and &s;pin, as we doe our ordinary wooll in <HI>Europe;</HI> and there are both &s;tuffs and cloth made of it of &s;everal &s;orts and in great aboun|dance; &s;ome very fine, like &s;ilk; others le&s;s fine: and of the cour&s;e&s;t &s;ort of all they make Sails for &s;hips, coverings for their Tents in the field, either when they are marching again&s;t an enemy, or following their Heards of Cattel to pa&s;ture, and in many other &s;uch like occa|&s;ions. And 'tis commonly the womans work, not onely to card and &s;pin, but al&s;o to weave this cotton into cloath, e&s;pecially one &s;ort of it, <HI>viz.</HI> of which they make their <HI>Inni's,</HI> as they call them, which are certain hanging Beds, much u&s;ed by the American People, both at <HI>Mexico</HI> and in all the Northern parts, and
<PB N="170" REF="95">
likewi&s;e in <HI>Peru.</HI> The&s;e are webs of a good &s;trong &s;ort of Cotton Cloath, woven about eight or nine foot long, and an ell broad, with loop-holes at each end; through which, by putting a cord or &s;ome &s;mall line, they hang them up in their hou&s;es upon beams or tain|ters made for that purpo&s;e; and when they are abroad in the fields, or hunting in the woods, upon the boughs of trees, or any other thing they finde convenient. They u&s;e them chiefly in the field, and when they march a|gain&s;t their enemies; for they are not very trouble&s;ome to carrie, and are much more convenient and healthfull, either to &s;leep in, or lie upon, than the bare ground, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Countries, and in the night time: And when they are foul, they make a lye of a certain great <HI>Cucumer</HI> or <HI>Gourd</HI> cut in pieces and &s;teept a good while in water, and after|wards boyled; with which they &s;cowre and bring them to as perfect whitene&s;s, as any Soap or Fullers-earth would be able to doe.</P>
<P N="5">5. And becau&s;e the Silks, Taffaties, Sattins, and other fine Draperie of <HI>America,</HI> are not only as good for the mo&s;t part as tho&s;e of the Ea&s;tern parts, but begin al&s;o now to be as great a Merchandi&s;e, both from <HI>Mexico</HI> and
<PB N="171" REF="95">
<HI>Peru;</HI> and for that the Countrie affordeth &s;uch good plenty of Mulberrie trees, both planted and naturally growing (the leaves whereof are the mo&s;t proper and kindely &s;u|&s;tenance of the Worm, which breeds and makes the Silk) I mu&s;t not pa&s;s it over without &s;ome &s;hort touch at lea&s;t upon this &s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI> of the nature of Silk it &s;elf, and e&s;pecially of that admirable Creature <HI>the Silk-Worm,</HI> which breeds it. Silk originally is nothing el&s;e but a fine thred &s;pun out of the bowels of a certain Worm, which the Latins call <HI>Bom|byx,</HI> we in Engli&s;h co~monly <HI>the Silk Worm;</HI> in &s;ame the manner as the common Spider weaves his dusky, yet curious web, out of him&s;elf. The Worm at the Indies is of the bigne&s;s of a Mans finger or thumb, &s;omewhat greater than tho&s;e of <HI>Italy</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and is bred two manner of waies: that is to &s;ay, by putrefaction, as other In&s;ects commonly are, and al&s;o by a more proper and &s;pecifical generation. The fir&s;t is, according to the re|port of <HI>Pliny</HI> in his <HI>Naturall Hi&s;tory,</HI> of the Flowers of the Cypre&s;s and Turpentine trees, and likewi&s;e many times of the A&s;h and Oake, which, in time of year, either fall from the trees of them&s;elves, or el&s;e are beaten off with rain-&s;howers; out of which leaves corrupted and
<PB N="172" REF="96">
putrified upon the ground, there is &s;oon after, by the heat of the Sun and the exhalations or vapours that i&s;&s;ue out of the earth, a certain In&s;ect ingendred, of the bigne&s;s of a Butter flie, naked and &s;mooth at fir&s;t, like a Worm; but, in time, coming to be over-grown with a kinde of hair, and after that with a thicker and warmer coat, which, again&s;t winter, the In&s;ect works for it &s;elf out of the Cotton, or downy fillets of tho&s;e leaves among which it was bred, or can otherwi&s;e come by. Their other man|ner of breeding is by generation properly &s;o called, that is, by coupling of Sexes: for there is both Male and Female of them. The man|ner thus. The Silk-worm, after he hath wrought up his bagge, or ball of &s;ilk to the full, &s;oon after dyeth within it; and though he leaves but a poor <HI>Skeleton</HI> or thin <HI>corps</HI> be|hinde him; yet out of it, laid in &s;ome clo&s;e &s;ubterraneous room, where no winde cometh, in a few dayes after it is putrified, there &s;prings a pair of other In&s;ects or worms of the &s;ame kinde, though not altogether of the &s;ame fi|gure or &s;hape; for they are both horned and winged. The&s;e the Latins call <HI>Chry&s;alides,</HI> and &s;eem to be made only for generation, or pre&s;erving the kinde: for as much as they doe nothing el&s;e but gender for the &s;pace of three
<PB N="173" REF="96">
or four dayes together; at the end whereof the Male dieth, leaving the Female behinde him impregnated and big with a numerous i&s;&s;ue of little egges, to the number of one hundred &s;ometimes or more, of the bigne&s;s of Millet &s;eeds, or &s;ome other &s;maller &s;ort of grain; of which a&s;&s;oon as &s;he is delivered, &s;he likewi&s;e followeth the Male, and dyeth.</P>
<P N="6">6. Out of the&s;e eggs (for &s;o the Authors perpetually call them) a new Breed or Stock of wormes, is to be gotten, which is the &s;econd manner of their breeding, as hath been &s;aid; neither is it the lea&s;t part of the care and skill of tho&s;e that keep Silke-wormes, and trade in the making of Silk, to hatch them well: the be&s;t way whereof, and mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other parts, is &s;aid to be the naturall heat of a woman, either in bed, or otherwi&s;e carrying them about her, in her bo&s;ome be|twixt her brea&s;ts; e&s;pecially if &s;he be a woman of good complexion, or a Virgin: and &s;o they are hatched commonly in three or four dayes. They keep the eggs all Winter long for the mo&s;t part, and without any great inconveni|ence, not thinking of hatching them, till the Mulberie-trees be well blo&s;om'd, the leaves whereof are their mo&s;t naturall food, and are &s;eldome out before the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> or
<PB N="174" REF="97">
beginning of <HI>June.</HI> When the eggs are hatch't, and the worm appeares, the next care is to procure it &s;u&s;tenance, whereby it may grow to a bigne&s;s, and &s;trength able to work. Their be&s;t meat, as I &s;aid, is the Mulbury leaves; for though they feed them &s;ometimes with the leaves of <HI>Rubus,</HI> or the great Bramble, with Lettice, and likwi&s;e with Nettle-leaves; yet neither doe they thrive &s;o well, nor weave &s;o bigge a web, as they doe, when they are fed with the Mulberry-leaf. They feed with a great appetite, a&s;&s;oone as ever they are bred, eating con&s;tantly thrice a day, <HI>viz.</HI> at Morning, Noon, and Night, when they are young; and when they are grown to &s;ome bigne&s;s, five or &s;ix times every day. After they have fed well for the &s;pace of nine or ten dayes together, and their bellies are full, they are taken with a kinde of dead &s;leep: which holds them for the mo&s;t part three or four dayes together: and though it be a &s;ickne&s;&s;e and &s;ome weakning to them, yet they awake of them&s;elves, and in time by good handling &s;eem to be revived with it, and fall to feeding afre&s;h. And this they doe con&s;tantly, that is, feed, &s;leep, and revive a|gain, three &s;everall times at lea&s;t before they come to their full &s;trength, or to be able to weave: which is commonly about fourty or
<PB N="175" REF="97">
fifty dayes after their fir&s;t birth. When they have had their la&s;t and longe&s;t &s;leep; for the &s;pace of eight or ten dayes together afterwards they feed the &s;toutlie&s;t of all, and then quite give over; which they that keep them percei|ving, know that now their belly is full, and that they are ready to worke out all again that they have hitherto eaten, with the advantage of a rare intere&s;t be&s;ide. They know it al&s;o by this, that the bagge of Silk, that is to &s;ay, the matter out of which the Worme afterward &s;pins the Silk, begins to appeare, and to &s;hine through the lawn coverture or thin &s;ides of the worm. Again&s;t which time they that look to their working, have alwayes in readine&s;s &s;ome boughs or branches of the Oke, Che&s;nut, or any other tree, who&s;e &s;ub&s;tance is very hard and dry: for upon &s;uch they alwayes work be&s;t; any degree of moi&s;tne&s;s, how little &s;o|ever, whither of the aire, or in their Loomes, or otherwi&s;e, being counted very prejudiciall both to the Worm and web. Upon the&s;e boughs they lay the Wormes, which pre&s;ently fall to work and &s;pinning of their thred from one twig to another, backward, forward and athwart, as them&s;elves plea&s;e, alwaies wor|king inward, that is from the circumference to the center or middle part, till at la&s;t they have
<PB N="176" REF="98">
&s;pun out a round bag of Silk, for the mo&s;t part of an Ovil or oblong figure, in which la&s;t of all they clo&s;e up them&s;elves; yet &s;till continuing to work, till they have either wholly or well nigh filled up the bag within, and that the bot|tome within them&s;elves, <HI>viz.</HI> within their bow|ells, and out of which they &s;pin, be quite &s;pent and unravelled. The bag, or web which the&s;e Silk-wormes &s;pin is many times as big as a mans head all of one thred, &s;o fine, that it can hardly be di&s;cerned, but by very good eyes, and &s;pun out &s;o long without any rupture or once breaking off, that, as <HI>Aldrovandus</HI> affirmeth, &s;ome one, of them might be able to circle about the bigge&s;t City in <HI>Italy.</HI> The colour of it is different, white, yellow, green; or otherwi&s;e, according either to the nature of the Climate and Country where they work, or to the qua|lity of the food, with which the wormes are fed. This &s;pinning holds them conmonly nine or ten dayes. When all is done, and they are come, as it were, to the la&s;t thred of the Clue, and that the Worme, by filling up the bottome of the bag, hath quite emptied her &s;elf, in a &s;hort time &s;he dies, as we &s;aid before, in the mid&s;t of her &s;elf made pri&s;on and work: and there &s;pring out of her <HI>Skeleton,</HI> after &s;ome few days, two other le&s;&s;er Wormes, of the &s;ame
<PB N="177" REF="98">
kinde, though differing &s;omewhat in &s;hape and figure; who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is onely to propagate, as we likewi&s;e &s;aid; and that being done they die: and the Silk-ma&s;ters unravelling again the whole web, or bag of &s;ilk, which the dead Ar|ti&s;t hath wrought, order it according to their own skill, as may be mo&s;t fit for the Merchant; of which I can &s;ay but little.</P>
<P N="7">7. This is the generation of Silk-wormes, which as briefly as I could, I have de&s;cribed from the report of divers Authors; e&s;pecially of <HI>Hieronimus Vida</HI> his curious and elegant poem of this &s;ubject intituled <HI>de Bombyce:</HI> and this is the originall and fir&s;t ground of Silk, that &s;o rare and &s;o much e&s;teemed ve&s;ture: it is but the entrayles of a Worme, an effect of putri|faction and rottenne&s;s: which if the Gallants and Ladies of the world, when they ruffle mo&s;t in it, would be plea&s;'d a little to reflect upon, perhaps it would doe them no harm; and be a means, that while it renders their outward per&s;onages comely and fine, as it doth, it &s;hould not put their inward and better part &s;o much out of fa&s;hion.</P>

this. They are Trees of &s;omewhat a larger &s;ize than ordinary, of a great body or trunk and al&s;o of high growth. They beare their fruit in clu&s;ters like grapes, being indeed nothing el&s;e but a multitude of &s;mall berries growing together upon one long bunch, ju&s;t as grapes doe. The leaves are broad and &s;omewhat thick, of a very green colour, and &s;harpening to|wards the end in fa&s;hion of a heart &s;eeming to be &s;nipt or cut round about the edges with little ga&s;hes, more or le&s;s deep, according to the kinde of the Mulberry: for there are two &s;orts of them, <HI>viz</HI> the black &amp; the white; &s;o cal|ed from the colour of the fruit which they bear: the fir&s;t whereof, when ripe is outward|ly black, but the pulpe of it, or jucy &s;ub&s;tance within red or of a deep murry; the other white and of a more plea&s;ant ta&s;t, &s;omething re&s;em|bling wine. They grow be&s;t in hot Countries: and where they make Silk, there are whole Woods and Groves of them, made or pre&s;er|ved on purpo&s;e, onely for the Silk-wormes to feed on. Of all the Trees of the Garden it is counted to be the la&s;t that putteth forth its blo&s;&s;omes; which it never doth till about the end of <HI>May,</HI> or beginning of <HI>June,</HI> when all the cold weather is gone: and till then the Silk-wormes al&s;o, where they breed naturally and
<PB N="179" REF="99">
not by the art and care of man, lye dead like &s;o many little grains or &s;eeds, or like the dung|ing of fle&s;h-flies, upon the ground; but after that time begin to revive and &s;hew them&s;elves; as if there were &s;ome naturall &s;ympathy and corre&s;pondence betwixt the one and the other. They grow either naturally of a &s;lip of their own kinde, or by the inoculation or grafting upon &s;ome other Trees: and the white Mul|berry is commonly a graft upon that which is called the white Poplar. There are good &s;tore of them &s;aid to be at <HI>Bermudaz, Virginia,</HI> and &s;ome other Engli&s;h Plantations; which, if the Planters had Skill, or were enjoyned to mind the bu&s;ine&s;s, might in time afford great plen|ty of Silks, and a richer trade and employment than any other Commodity they yet deale in. But they think not of it; and therefore it may well &s;uffice to have &s;poken thus much of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the abundance and excellency of the Metals at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> e&s;pecially of Gold and Silver.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AMerica</HI> or the <HI>New World,</HI> is doubtle&s;s a Country admirable rich, &amp; which the Soveraign Creator of all things hath plentifully &s;tored with all &s;orts of the mo&s;t excellent and rare endowments of nature, as well in the rank and order of things inanimate or without life, as of living creatures; according as in part wee have &s;een allready, and may be more large|ly and to admiration ob&s;erved, as the &s;cattered in&s;tances or tokens of his Divine Magnificence and bounty, in all the Hi&s;tories and reports of the Country. But of that wherein it &s;eemes mo&s;t of all to excell, wee have yet &s;poken no|thing <HI>viz.</HI> of the Metals, which alone were able to render it the mo&s;t de&s;irable part of the World, though it had no other advanta|ges. It aboundeth with all &s;orts of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Iron, Bra&s;s, Copper, Lead, Tin, &amp;c. But the excellency and richne&s;s of the other two, <HI>viz.</HI> Gold and Silver, and likewi&s;e of that which is as it were, the Sperm and Solder of the&s;e, and
<PB N="181" REF="100">
of all other Metals be&s;ide, <HI>viz.</HI> Quick&s;ilver, is &s;uch, that it makes all the re&s;t to be neither much &s;poken of, nor much &s;ought after in the&s;e parts. In which re&s;pect I conceive I may be more ea&s;ily excu&s;ed, if I pa&s;s them over likewi&s;e in &s;ilence, and make <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> only the &s;ubject of my following di&s;cour&s;e, which are &s;o much (would to God I might not as truly &s;ay <HI>too-much</HI>) the &s;ubject of all our de&s;ires, <HI>viz.</HI> the Metals of Gold and Silver.</P>
<P N="2">2. Among all Metalls, Gold hath ju&s;tly the preheminence or fir&s;t place, in the e&s;teeme of men, by rea&s;on of its naturall perfection and purity, which is &s;uch, as it renders the Metal in a manner incorruptible and of immortall durance. It is not improbably conceived to be a &s;ub&s;tance, wherein the Elements, <HI>viz.</HI> Fire, Earth, Water, &amp;c. (which are the naturall In|gredients and con&s;titution of all other &s;ublu|nary bodies) are mixed with mo&s;t equall and exact proportion, both for quantity and quality, that is, there is no more of the Sub&s;tance of any of them found in it, then the condition of the re&s;t will mo&s;t fitly agree with and endure, and that &s;ub&s;tance likwi&s;e mo&s;t perfectly defecate and purged by the work of nature from all intrin&s;ecall impurity or cor|ruption, before it meets in compo&s;ition with
<PB N="182" REF="101">
the re&s;t, whence ari&s;eth &s;uch a perfect Union and Con&s;olidation of all the Elementall &s;ub|&s;tances in the &s;ub&s;tance of Gold as is invinci|ble, and re&s;i&s;teth the actiivity of all other bo|dies what&s;oever le&s;s purified, and le&s;s perfectly mixed, who&s;e contrariety &s;hould otherwi&s;e cau&s;e corruption, or the di&s;&s;olution of its &s;ub|&s;tantiall and e&s;&s;entiall parts. I &s;ay the Elements in the compo&s;ition of Gold, are both &s;o pure in them&s;elves, and likewi&s;e &s;o perfectly mixed in due proportion to another, that it is natu|rally impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be &s;eparate, or di&s;|&s;olved one from another by the action of any other body, in which 'tis evident, they are not &s;o perfectly mixed. Yea the Fire it &s;elf, the mo&s;t active of all Elements and Elementary bodies, which incinerates and turns to A&s;hes, the &s;ub&s;tance of all common Metals, and &s;en&s;ibly wa&s;teth Silver it &s;elf, yet prevails noe further upon this, than only to refine and pu|rifie it, that is, to deliver it from the adulte|rate and improper mixture of other Metals; but wa&s;teth not one dram or &s;cruple of pure Gold, though you melt it a hundred times o|ver. This renders Gold in a manner incorrup|tible and immortall (&s;peaking naturally) and by con&s;equence the mo&s;t excellent and fitting in&s;trument of commerce and bartery that the
<PB N="183" REF="101">
wit and rea&s;on of man could invent or de&s;ire. Second in excellency and in all properties of perfection unto Gold, is that of Silver; a &s;ub|&s;tance, or Metallick body, wherein the Ele|ment of water &s;eems to pravail in &s;ome undue proportion above that of fire rendring thereby the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the Metall of a con&s;ti|tution flegmatick, as I may &s;ay, and feminine, that is weak and le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t contrarieties, as appeares by the pale colour of it, and by ex|perience upon all occa&s;ions of tryall: yet in compari&s;on of all other Metals except Gold only) it is with all rea&s;on preferred, and que|&s;tionle&s;s excells them all both in purity and perfection of mixture, as much as it &s;elf is ex|celled by gold; and perhaps much more. For I ob&s;erve, the Metals of gold and &s;ilver doe (both of them) exceed all the other &s;orts of Metals, whither Iron, Bra&s;s, Copper, &amp;c. in|comparably or beyond compari&s;on, as wee &s;ay; I mean, there never was any certain compari|&s;on, or proportion of value, fixed and &s;etled betwixt the one and the other by e&s;timation or the common con&s;ent of men, as to &s;ay how much a pound of Gold is better worth than a pound of Iron; or a pound of Silver than a pound of Bra&s;s or Lead; not but that it may be ea&s;ily calculated and known, how much the
<PB N="184" REF="102">
one exceeds the other in value; but becau&s;e <HI>it is not commonly known,</HI> nor ever was, I &s;up|po&s;e, by any general and certain e&s;timation or count among men: whereas the proportion, or difference in value, betwixt gold and &s;ilver, hath ever been generally and certainly known among men; not indeed &s;o fixed &amp; certain as to be alwaies, &amp; in all places, one and the &s;ame (for it varieth according to times and places, and e&s;pecially according as either the one or the other metal is plentiful, or &s;car&s;e, needfull, or counted le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary among men) but yet a proportion or &s;ome certain difference in va|lue hath been ever commonly e&s;timated and a&s;&s;igned betwixt them. Anciently the pro|portion betwixt the&s;e metals is &s;aid to have been of <HI>ten for one,</HI> that is, one talent of gold was held to be worth ten talents of &s;ilver; &s;o that if five talents of gold were due, and a man would make payment in &s;ilver, he &s;hould pay fifty talents; and for fifty due in gold, five hundred in &s;ilver. <HI>Pliny</HI> reports, that at the fir&s;t coyning of the&s;e metals in <HI>Rome,</HI> the proportion was fourteen and an half or fifteen for one; others, as <HI>Herodotus,</HI> &s;peak of thir|teen. But that which &s;eems now to be mo&s;t common at the Indies, <HI>China,</HI> and other pla|ces, e&s;pecially where &s;ilver is &s;carce, is the pro|portion
<PB N="185" REF="102">
of twelve for one; So that if an ounce of &s;ilver be worth five &s;hillings, as it is &s;aid to be, an ounce of gold is worth three pound &s;terling, &amp; a pound of gold in weight worth no le&s;s than fourty eight pound of &s;ilver in Coyn.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of this Metal, <HI>viz</HI> gold, there is &s;uch plenty at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> that, be&s;ide the in|finite rich Mines thereof, which they have in all the Provinces of the Southern part, <HI>viz. Peru, Ca&s;tella del oro, Chile, &amp;c.</HI> and likewi&s;e in many of them in the Northern, e&s;pecially in the Countries of <HI>Nicaragua, Veragua, Guadalaiara,</HI> there is &s;car&s;e a River of note in all tho&s;e parts, but the &s;ands of it are well powder'd with gold, and afford good &s;tore of it to the wa&s;hers: yea the very earth, or common &s;oil, which they dig, or otherwi&s;e take up in mo&s;t parts of <HI>Peru,</HI> is &s;o tinctured with it, and yeelds ever and anon &s;uch grains and crumblings of it, that <HI>Aco&s;ta,</HI> an Author no way lavi&s;h of his reports, nor of a light judgement, profe&s;&s;eth to think there is much more of the metal yet to be di&s;covered than hath been found; judging, as he doth, by the ge|neral qualitie or tincture of the Soile. There be three &s;orts of gold at the Indies, or rather the &s;ame gold or metal they finde in three &s;everal manners or waies, <HI>viz. in grains,</HI> as they call
<PB N="186" REF="103">
them, <HI>in powder,</HI> and <HI>in &s;tone.</HI> Gold <HI>in graines</HI> they call certain &s;mall pieces of gold, which they finde in the earth, of pure and perfect me|tal, without mixture of any other &s;ort of ba&s;er alloy, or at lea&s;t with &s;o &s;mall a mixture, as it &s;car&s;e needeth melting or refining. The&s;e the Spaniards in <HI>America</HI> call <HI>Pepones,</HI> from &s;ome re&s;emblance which the grains have to the &s;eeds of Melons or Pompions; though many times they are much bigger, and contain a pound weight or more. They finde &s;ilver likewi&s;e &s;ometimes in the &s;ame manner, <HI>viz</HI> in grains, and pure; but that is but &s;eldome, and a little in compari&s;on of what they finde of the other. Gold <HI>in &s;tone,</HI> is a vein or little Mine of gold, which groweth and &s;preadeth it &s;elf into branches in &s;ome flint or other &s;tone, ju&s;t as &s;ilver doth in the Mine. Much of this &s;ort is found in the Mines of <HI>Curuma,</HI> and about the <HI>Salinas</HI> or <HI>Salt-wooks</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> a place &s;o cal|led; where they finde huge &s;tones pierced ma|ny times quite through, and interlaced every way with veins of gold, in &s;uch quantity, and &s;o richly, that the &s;tone is found, not &s;eldom, to be more than half gold. Of this &s;ort is that which they finde mo&s;t commonly in the Mines, and is very good gold, but requireth exce&s;&s;ive labour and pains to break it from the &s;tone,
<PB N="187" REF="103">
and to get it forth. Gold <HI>in powder,</HI> is that which they gather in Rivers, Brooks, and other places where any &s;tore of water pa&s;&s;eth from the Mountains, the &s;treams or torrents where|of, bring along with them, from the &s;aid mountains, aboundance of this metal in &s;mall pieces, which, as it comes, &s;etleth continually in the &s;ands and breaches of the &s;aid Rivers, where afterwards it is found. I &s;ay the gold it &s;elf is mo&s;t probably thought to be ingen|dred on the tops of the mountains or moun|tainous parts of the Earth, and perhaps not far from the Source and Springs of tho&s;e Ri|vers in which it is found, and into who&s;e &s;treams it is ea&s;ily conceived to be devolved in tract of time, by &s;howres of rain, and by many other natural cau&s;es; and is not bred or ingendred in the &s;and or &s;tream it &s;elf: And &s;o likewi&s;e 'tis ob&s;erved, they finde mo&s;t plen|ty of it commonly after &s;ome great floods. Of this &s;ort of gold they gather greate&s;t quan|tity; there being, as I &s;aid, &s;car&s;e a River of note in the whole Country of <HI>Peru,</HI> or Sou|thern part of <HI>America,</HI> who&s;e &s;ands are not more or le&s;s tinctured and enamel'd with it. And it is mo&s;t plentifull, &s;o is it likewi&s;e, for the mo&s;t part, very pure, and needs not half that labour of refining it, which gold <HI>in &s;tone,</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="104">
or of the Mine u&s;ually doth. To gather it, they fir&s;t of all divert, or turn the cour&s;e of the &s;tream &s;ome other way, and then &s;earch the Ford, e&s;pecially in the breaches, if there be any, and in the cliffs, or hollow places of the banks, where it is likely it may &s;ettle in its pa&s;|&s;age with the waters: and in &s;uch places they alwaies finde be&s;t &s;tore. It is, for the mo&s;t part, the womens work to gather this &s;ort of gold; which they doe in this manner. They &s;it com|monly knee-deep in the water, upon the bank of &s;ome River, or other place, where they have good &s;tore of water before them, with a Trey or little Bole in their hands, cut &s;loping on either &s;ide, but in the mid&s;t deep and round, like the bottom of a Barbors Ba&s;on, having a good quantity of the &s;and which they are to wa&s;h, continually &s;tanding by them, &amp; which is brought to them by &s;ome other body appoin|ted to &s;erve them: Of this &s;and they take what quantity they think fit, and wa&s;h it in their Treys, in &s;uch manner, as the &s;and and &s;andy earth ea&s;ily wa&s;heth away together with the water, and the gold, by rea&s;on of its heavine&s;s and weight, naturally &s;inks down and &s;lips into the deep bottom or bole of the Trey: which when they have done, they deli|ver it likewi&s;e to others that &s;tand there to
<PB N="189" REF="104">
receive it, and take in more &s;and. So that to every Trey, or wa&s;her of gold, there are three or four per&s;ons at lea&s;t appointed to attend, <HI>viz.</HI> one to bring the &s;and from the River to the wa&s;her, another to receive the gold when it is wa&s;hed, one to over&s;ee the work, and another to provide victuals and nece&s;&s;aries for them all. For they &s;tir not from morning till night, from the place where they work. And thus you &s;hall &s;ee hundreds of people wa&s;hing and &s;earching for gold all along the banks of the Rivers. This is generally the way of ga|thering of gold: as for their manner of re|fining it, we &s;hall &s;peak of that and the re|fining of &s;ilver all under one.</P>
<P N="4">4. Silver they finde either in veins <HI>&s;tragling,</HI> as they call them, or <HI>fixed.</HI> The fir&s;t is, when they finde &s;ome piece, or a few &s;mall pieces of that metal alone; which when they have taken out of the Mine, or &s;tone, there is no more of it to be found. The other is, when the vein of the metal runneth out, and &s;preads it &s;elf up and down the Mine, in breadth and length, upward, downward, and every way, like the root of a tree with arms, boughs, and branches; for &s;o for the mo&s;t part it doth; and the Mi|nerali&s;ts doe commonly repre&s;ent the Mines of the&s;e metals, e&s;pecially of &s;ilver, by the type
<PB N="190" REF="105">
of a tree planted within the bowels, or middle part, of &s;ome great mountain, with its root &s;preading largely downward, and with its boughs and branches reaching as far upwards, even to the top, or higher parts of the moun|tain; at which it u&s;ually di&s;covers it &s;elf, ei|ther by &s;ome part of the pure vein it &s;elf, brea|king out, and running along upon the ridges of the mountain, or but little within the &s;ur|face of the Earth, or el&s;e by the &s;ignes; which are certain fumo&s;ities, or metallick exhalati|ons, which the Mine &s;endeth forth, of diver&s;e colours, <HI>viz.</HI> yellowi&s;h, white, blew, green, according to the &s;trength and quality of the Mine, and its neer approach to the &s;urface of the Earth. The&s;e &s;ignes, where they finde them, they call <HI>Marcha&s;ites;</HI> and the neerer they approach in colour to the metal which they &s;ignifie, the better &s;ignes they are accounted to be, as arguing that the Mine is rich, and that the metal within the ground is well con|cocted and pure. This, we mu&s;t know, is a ge|neral rule to di&s;cover and finde the Mines, but not univer&s;al. For &s;ometimes they venture to dig, and fall upon very good Mines, without any &s;uch &s;pecial &s;ignes appearing, only induced by the quality of the earth, and the natural barrenne&s;s of the mountain or place where
<PB N="191" REF="105">
they digge. And 'tis generally counted in <HI>Pe|ru</HI> a &s;igne good enough, if the mountain or mountainous part of the Earth which they pitch upon (for in &s;uch a Soile only the be&s;t and riche&s;t Mines are found) be very rugged, hard, and &s;harp, and &s;o ab&s;olutely barren, that not a Tree, Plant, or Shrub, groweth on it, and that the gra&s;s (if yet it bear any) be of a faint withered colour, and &s;eeming, as it were, to be parched with drought. The&s;e veins lye commonly deep within ground, yet affording very good and pure metal. The principal veins of the Mine, for the mo&s;t part, run directly North and South, yet branching them&s;elves into le&s;&s;er boughs &s;everal wayes, <HI>viz.</HI> Ea&s;t, We&s;t, and towards all quarters, being found many times five or &s;ix foot broad, and &s;eldom &s;o narrow as a &s;pan, and this running and branching of the veins in the Mine, they call the <HI>Cha&s;e.</HI> The way of digging for the metal is diver&s;e. Sometimes they begin at the top, or upper part of the mountain, where they fir&s;t ob&s;erve the <HI>Marcha&s;ites,</HI> or &s;ignes of the me|tal, and &s;ink the Mine downward like a well, only taking a convenient &s;pace of ground for the platform or compa&s;s of the Mine, and lea|ving <HI>Stanzas,</HI> or places to re&s;t upon and di|&s;patch nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, at a certain di&s;tance
<PB N="192" REF="106">
one from another continually, as they work deeper into the Mine. The other is, to begin to digge at the foot, or neer the bottom of the mountain, in line almo&s;t level, that is, &s;loping a little upwards, and till they come perpen|dicularly under the place, where they fir&s;t ob|&s;erved the tokens of the metal; it being a thing generally pre&s;umed by the Miners, that though every Mine of metal that may be in the body of a mountain, doth not &s;hew it &s;elf by &s;ignes at the top, as when it lyes very deep within ground, or is ob&s;tructed by &s;ome Quarrey of &s;tone or otherwi&s;e, yet where&s;oever any &s;uch &s;ignes of it doe appear at the top, there it reacheth to the bottom of the mountain or to the level of the plain ground, at lea&s;t well nigh to it, and that the deeper the Mine runs within ground, the bigger and better it is, verifying in a new &s;en&s;e the proverb, <HI>The be&s;t is at the bottome.</HI> This is counted the be&s;t way of Mining, and mo&s;t commodious in many re&s;pects, e&s;pecially for drayning away of the waters, which are commonly found in the Mineral hills, and doe extreamly trouble the Miners in their work, if they be not diverted; and likewi&s;e for carrying the &s;ilver out of the Mines when it is digged: neither of which can be done the other way, <HI>viz.</HI> where the Mine
<PB N="193" REF="106">
is &s;unk right downward, without exce&s;&s;ive la|bour, charge, time, and hazard to the work|men; but this way are done with ea&s;e. For the waters that i&s;&s;ue out of the chinks of the mountain, and fall into the Mines, are ea&s;ily received into certain Ci&s;terns, made for the purpo&s;e, and by pipes diverted which way they plea&s;e; and the &s;ilver is no le&s;s ea&s;ily carried out of the Mine: For the way to the mouth of it being either level or &s;loping downwards, the poor Miners are not forced to mount with it upon their backs, as they doe the other way two hundred, &s;ometimes three hundred <HI>&s;tades,</HI> or man-heights, from the place where they dig it, upon ladders made of Neats-hides or leather, and from which, many times by mi&s;chance, they fall down with it into the Mines upon their backs, and are broken to pieces. If they dig far into the mountain, be|fore they come at the Mine, they are forced to u&s;e the Compa&s;s to direct their cour&s;e, as if they were at Sea, according as by the &s;ignes they ob&s;erved the vein to run, when they fir&s;t found it. They have likewi&s;e another advan|tage of the water, when they dig the Mine this way, <HI>viz.</HI> that by the force of it in the chan|nel or pipes, by which it runs out of the Mine, they turn about certain Mills, and other En|gins,
<PB N="194" REF="107">
by which they break and grinde the me|tal, when they have gotten it out of the Rock, and prepare it for the refining; doing likewi&s;e thereby many other nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;&s;es apper|taining to the Mines. Neverthele&s;s about and neer to the mouth of the Mine, they have hou|&s;es of all nece&s;&s;ary office be&s;ide, for the Mi|ners and other workmen; and e&s;pecially a Smiths Forge, for the &s;harpening and repairing of their tools: for their labour is exce&s;&s;ive hard and difficult, and it requires both edged tools and &s;trong armes to &s;plit the hard metal, and break it out of the Mine; which they are forced to doe with wedges, hammers, and all &s;orts of in&s;truments, and with no le&s;s difficul|tie than they break the harde&s;t flynt, or any other Quarry of &s;tone. They labour likewi&s;e perpetually in them, I mean, by turns, &s;o as while one company worketh, another &s;leepeth and takes re&s;t: but the work it &s;elf of the Mine never &s;tands &s;till, but goeth continually on night and day; of which, in the Mines, they know no difference, working altogether by candle-light, as well by day as by night, and without which, their noon and their midnight would be both alike. For indeed the Mines in this re&s;pect may be taken for the Suburbs of Hell, by rea&s;on of their extream darkne&s;s; and
<PB N="195" REF="107">
how neer &s;oever they be to that which com|mandeth all things, yet they alwaies want there three of the chief comforts of Nature, having neither Sun nor Light, nor good Aire in the Mines.</P>
<P N="5">5. The la&s;t and mo&s;t curious work about the Metals is the refining of them, that is, the &s;eparating and purging them from the mixture of other cour&s;er metals, with which they are alwaies more or le&s;s ingendred in the Mines. This is done two manner of waies, either by Fire, or by Quick-&s;ilver. The Indians ancient|ly, before the Spaniards came among them, u&s;ed no other way of refining but onely by fire, and melting of the metal. To which end they had u&s;ually, and have &s;till in many places, to this day, &s;everal &s;mall furnaces, which they call <HI>Guayras,</HI> built neer the Mines, in places where the winde commonly bloweth; with which, without further trouble or need of bellows, only by &s;upplying them with wood or coale from time to time, as &s;hall be nece&s;|&s;ary, they make their refining. And they &s;ay there is &s;ome kinde of &s;ilver, particularly that of <HI>Potozi,</HI> which will not be melted by any artificial winde they can make, as of the bel|lows, or otherwi&s;e, but only by that which is natural of the <HI>Guayras:</HI> and therefore upon

But the more common and &s;peedy way is to refine by Quick-&s;ilver, which the Spani|ards doe now generally u&s;e; both becau&s;e they have extraordinary plenty of it, and becau&s;e they finde it draws more &s;ilver out of the ma&s;s which they refine, than by fire they can doe.</P>
<P N="6">6. Quick-&s;ilver among metals is like water among the elements, it is the glue and &s;older of them, <HI>viz.</HI> when it is refracted and in due proportion: for otherwi&s;e, when it is united, and entire in it &s;elf, it &s;eparates and con&s;umes all of them but gold and &s;ilver. In which re|&s;pect they call it not improperly the <HI>Humidum radicale</HI> of metals. It is a liquid &s;ub&s;tance, ha|ving no certain form or fixed &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of it &s;elf, but runs continually from place to place, as gold and &s;ilver, or other metals doe, when they are melted, yet is it the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t compacted of all other metals; for they all &s;wim upon quick-&s;ilver, and will never &s;ink to the bottom. They &s;ay a piece of Iron of two

It hath many rare and admirable properties; but that which may &s;eem mo&s;t remarkable, and which fits it &s;o much for the effect we are now &s;peaking of, <HI>viz.</HI> the refining and purifying of the metals, is the natural &s;ympathie and in|clination which it hath to gold and &s;ilver, e&s;pe|cially the fir&s;t; which it naturally &s;eeks out, where it is to be found, among all metals, &s;e|parates and divides it from them all, and it &s;elf embracing and circling it round about im|mediatly, and without the mixture or inter|po&s;ition of any thing el&s;e but it &s;elf. In the &s;ame manner, but not altogether &s;o intimately and perfectly it unites with &s;ilver; not pene|trating the &s;ub&s;tance of the metal, which the perfect compo&s;ition thereof, if it be pure and fine, re&s;i&s;teth and forbiddeth as hath been &s;aid, but only embracing and circling about it on all &s;ides, yet piercing and con&s;uming the cour|&s;er metals, if there be, and &s;o long as there be any of them mixed with it. And though it be
<PB N="198" REF="109">
of it &s;elf the heavie&s;t of all other metals, yet is it &s;oone&s;t tran&s;muted or changed into the lighte&s;t &s;ub&s;tance of all, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;moak; which a little fire pre&s;ently doth: and that &s;moak eva|porating, and flying up into any colder Region or when it encounters any cold metal, as in the head or top of a Still, it pre&s;ently gathers together again, and becomes perfect quick-&s;ilver. Hence it &s;erveth &s;o excellently well to refine and purifie both the&s;e metals, <HI>viz.</HI> gold and &s;ilver, and likewi&s;e to be it &s;elf &s;epara|ted from them again afterward. It groweth naturally in the Vermillion, or <HI>Minium,</HI> which is a metal well known &amp; much u&s;ed for paint|ing &amp; dying; and of which they have admirable rich Mines in diver&s;e parts of <HI>America;</HI> e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of <HI>Palcas,</HI> out of which they draw yearly, only for the Kings u&s;e, a hundred thou|&s;and <HI>pezos</HI> of mine; and tho&s;e of <HI>Guancavilca,</HI> which yeeld every yeer eight or nine thou&s;and Quintals, or &s;o many times one hundred twenty five pound weight of quick-&s;ilver: And of another they report, that a poor Indi|an of <HI>Acoria,</HI> who fir&s;t found it, &s;old the inte|re&s;t which he thereby had in the Mine, <HI>viz.</HI> for di&s;covering of it, for two hundred and fiftie thou&s;and Duckats, and afterwards commen|ced a &s;uit again&s;t the buyer for deceiving him

in the bargain; it being found, that his only intere&s;t in the Mine, for finding it, was well worth five hundred thou&s;and pound and more. Before they can u&s;e it for the refining &amp; purging of other metals, they mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;eparate it from the &s;tone or metal in w^c^h it groweth. This they ea&s;ily doe by fire, which melts the &s;tone, being fir&s;t well grinded or broken, &amp; the quick-&s;ilver evaporates in &s;moak up to the head or top of the Limbeck, or ve&s;&s;ell wherein it is melted, where encountring a colder &s;ub&s;tance, it as quickly congregats and thickens again, and would fall pre&s;ently down again, but that in the di&s;cent it is by pipes in the head of the Limbe k or Stillatorie diverted into &s;ome other ve&s;&s;els ap|pointed to receive it. They keep it in nothing &s;o well as in leather-ve&s;&s;els: for any thing of wood or ordinary metal it would eate through and de&s;troy: and 'tis &s;aid, they &s;pend only at the Mines of <HI>Potozi,</HI> in the refining of &s;ilver by it, 6 or 7000 Quintals, one year with another.</P>
<P N="7">7. Silver, if it be good, even when 'tis fir&s;t digged out of the Mine, is of a white greyi&s;h colour, like the be&s;t &s;ort of Amber: but if it looks darker, inclining any thing to black or red, it is not counted good, but rather con|ceived to have in it a great quantity of earth and dro&s;s, which mu&s;t be purged away in the
<PB N="200" REF="110">
refining: Neverthele&s;s they count it no ill vein, when every pound weight of metal out of the Mine yeelds but two or three <HI>pezos</HI> of perfect &s;ilver, when 'tis refined. Now the man|ner of refining metals by quick-&s;ilver, and al&s;o of &s;eparating the quick-&s;ilver again from the metals, when they are perfectly refined, is thus. Fir&s;t of all with hammers, and other in&s;tru|ments for the purpo&s;e, they break and grinde the metals as &s;mall as po&s;&s;ibly they can, redu|cing them, &s;o neer as may be, into a du&s;t or powder, which they afterwards &s;ift through a &s;ear&s;e of Copper, and then put it into certain Troughs or broad open ve&s;&s;els, being fir&s;t moi|&s;tened or well &s;teept in brine or &s;alt water. This they doe, becau&s;e the &s;alt hath a certain quick penetrative force in it, and is apt to &s;eparate the earthly and dro&s;&s;ie parts which as yet &s;tick to the metal, and con&s;equently makes it more fit to receive and draw the quick &s;ilver to it. When this is done, they &s;et the ve&s;&s;els which contain the powder, or pulverizated &s;ub&s;tance of the metals upon little furnaces, with a &s;oft fire under them, which they increa&s;e by little and little. This is done, becau&s;e the fire al&s;o is ob&s;erved very much to help and facilitate the incorporating of the quick-&s;ilver, with the me|tal. After this having the quick-&s;ilver
<PB N="201" REF="110">
or Mercury (as the Chymi&s;ts call it from its nimblene&s;s and active, &s;earching into the me|tals) in a piece of Holland, or &s;ome other fine and &s;trong linnen, they pre&s;s or &s;train it through the cloath upon the metal in the ve&s;|&s;ells; upon which it falleth in &s;mall drops like dew: &s;ome body in the mean time con|tinually moving and &s;tirring the metal up and down in the ve&s;&s;el, while the quick-&s;ilver drops upon it, and afterwards al&s;o at times, for the &s;pace of five or &s;ix dayes together: in which time the mercury will be &s;o perfectly incor|porate with the metal, and have united it &s;elf &s;o intimately to it, that nothing &s;hall be be|twixt them, but that all the dro&s;s, earth, or other cour&s;e metal what&s;oever, with which it was naturally engendred or mixed before, &s;hall be either con&s;umed or &s;eparated from it. After &s;ome time, when the Refiners think the Mercury hath done his part, and be perfectly incorporated with the metal that is to be re|fined, they take the whole quantity or ma&s;s of it together, out of the Troughs or ve&s;&s;els where they are, and put it into certain other ve&s;&s;els, which are bigger and almo&s;t full of water; in which they again fall to &s;tir and to move the quick-&s;ilver and metal together up and down the ve&s;&s;el, in &s;uch manner, as that the earth and
<PB N="202" REF="111">
dro&s;&s;ie parts of the metal, &s;eparated from the other, doe pa&s;s away with the water, and the &s;ilver or gold united with the mercurie, as be|ing more ponderous and weighty &s;ub&s;tances, remain at the bottom: which they take out and wa&s;h yet once again in Keelers, or certain broad and deep platters, till it &s;eem throughly purged from the earth and dro&s;&s;ie &s;ub&s;tance. The metal thus united with mercury appears like &s;mall &s;and. And becau&s;e there alwaies &s;lips away &s;ome portion of &s;ilver and quick-&s;ilver with the dro&s;s in the wa&s;hings, there|fore they commonly wa&s;h that dro&s;s over and over again, till at length nothing be lo&s;t either of the one or other. When they are thus throughly clean&s;ed from the dro&s;s, they appear bright and &s;hining, either with a white or yellowi&s;h colour, according to the proper nature of the metal that is united with the mercury. And by this they know the me|tals are refined as much as they ought. Then followeth the la&s;t piece of work, which is to &s;eparate the mercury or quick-&s;ilver from the metal, wherewith it is incorporate, that &s;o they may have the pure metal alone. And this is done thus.</P>
<P N="8">8. Fir&s;t they &s;train it, as before, through a piece of &s;trong fine linnen, or Holland, as forcibly as
<PB N="203" REF="111">
they can by this means if there be any Quick-&s;ilver not incorporate and united with the me|tal, it pa&s;&s;eth out as before in little drops like dew which they gather and &s;ave; and the re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;ilver and quick-&s;ilver united remain in one lump together: which with much art and diligence they work la&s;t of all into the fa|&s;hion of a Sugar-loaf, containing mo&s;t com|monly one hundred pound weight in the whole, and made hollow in the mid&s;t. This they &s;et upon a furnace, covered with a certain earthern ve&s;&s;ell in the nature of a Limbeck or Still, but of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and mould that the metall within is, <HI>viz.</HI> of a Sugar-loaf, laying &s;ome few coals upon the top of it, and giving a good &s;trong heat to the furnace. With this heat all the quick-&s;ilver in the metal pre|&s;ently evaporates and flies up, as we &s;aid be|fore, into the top of the Limbeck or earthern ve&s;&s;ell, where being refrigerated by the en|counter of a colder &s;ub&s;tance, it quickly thick|ens again, and di&s;tils downwards by the &s;ides of the Limbeck, like the &s;moak or vapour of a pot covered and &s;eething on the fire; and by certain Retorts or pipes framed conveniently in the head or upper part of the &s;aid Limbeck or earthen ve&s;&s;el, it is not permitted to fall right down again, but diverted another way,

and received apart by it &s;elf. The &s;ilver in the mean time remaining entire upon the furnace, without changing form, but yet abating much of its weight, by rea&s;on of the ab&s;ence of the mercury, which is now flown quite away. They &s;ay it abates commonly five parts of &s;ix in the weight: &s;o that if the whole lump or loaf of &s;ilver and Mercury united, weigh three&s;core pound, when it is fir&s;t &s;et on the furnace, when the Mercury is &s;ublimated and gone, it weighs not above ten; &s;o great is the di&s;proportion or difference in weight betwixt them.</P>
<P N="9">9. For the breaking and grinding of the metalls, when they are fir&s;t taken out of the Mine, which, as we &s;aid before, is a nece&s;&s;ary preparative to their refining and incorpora|ting with the <HI>Mercury,</HI> they have many En|gins or Mills, &s;ome whereof goe with Hor&s;es or <HI>Bufalos</HI> in them; others are turned by wa|ter, carrying huge Pe&s;tles in them, which beat and break the metall, after the manner of Tanne-mills. They carry commonly twelve or fourteen Pe&s;tles apeice, and there are &s;aid to be no le&s;s than fourty eight of the&s;e Mills at <HI>Po|tozi,</HI> which goe by water, and thirty more which goe with Hor&s;es, be&s;ide a multitude of hand-Engins: at the City of <HI>Tarapaya,</HI> not farre from <HI>Potozi;</HI> there are twenty two all
<PB N="205" REF="112">
upon the water, which doe nothing el&s;e but grinde and break the &s;ilver, as in &s;o many great Morters, night and day without cea&s;ing. When the metal is thus &s;eparated from the Mercury, they count it pure and refined, whither it be gold or &s;ilver, and as &s;uch melt it again into barres, and carry it to the Touch&s;tone and marking. For it is not yet &s;o perfectly purified and fine, but it mu&s;t, at lea&s;t in part, endure one tryall and purging more. This is done by the A&s;&s;ay-ma&s;ter, as they call him, who gives to every peice or barre of &s;ilver, its particular Al|loy or value, according to which it mu&s;t be &s;old, and pa&s;s for metal more or le&s;s fine and pure, and without which Alloy and mark gi|ven it by the A&s;&s;ay-ma&s;ter, it is not lawfull to vend any of tho&s;e metalls. It's a great and rich Office at the Indies to be A&s;&s;ay-ma&s;ter, and requires likewi&s;e a great and exact skill in the metalls, <HI>viz.</HI> to give the true alloy and value to every peice and barre of metall that is brought. The bu&s;ine&s;s is done thus. They bring their metal in barres or ingots to the A&s;&s;ay-ma&s;ter or his Deputy, who cuts from every one of them a &s;mall peice of metal, and weighs it exactly, marking well out of which barre or ingot every peice was cut; and then puts them one by one into &s;everall Cru&s;ibles or Melting-pots
<PB N="206" REF="113">
which he hath &s;tanding on the fire, marked every one of them according to the number of the barre, to which the peice of metall belongs, that he puts into it. The&s;e Cru&s;ibles are little &s;mall ve&s;&s;ells made for no other purpo&s;e, but for the la&s;t trying of the metall, and mo&s;t com|monly of the a&s;hes of certain burnt bones, which are beaten together and ca&s;t into a Mould. To every one of the&s;e &s;et on the Fur|nace, the A&s;&s;ay-ma&s;ter gives a &s;trong and vio|lent fire by which the metal in&s;tantly melts, and the Lead, Copper, Tin, or other ba&s;er me|tal, in ca&s;e there be any yet remaining in it, di&s;|&s;olves and evoporates into &s;moake, and the &s;il|ver or other metal, remains in the Cru&s;ible a|lone, now advanced to the utmo&s;t perfection and finene&s;s that art can give it, and withall &s;o &s;trangely united and fixed in it &s;elf, that though it be liquid and molten, yet they &s;ay, it will never &s;pill nor run out, though the mouth of the Cru&s;ible &s;hould be turned downward, but abides &s;till within it, firm and fixed without loo&s;ing one drop, or the lea&s;t particle of its &s;ub&s;tance. When the A&s;&s;ay-ma&s;ter perceives by the colour of it (which is then fiery red) that the metal is perfectly refin'd, and that it hath evaporated all that was evoporable by fire in its &s;ub&s;tance, he takes the &s;everall Cru&s;ibles off the
<PB N="207" REF="113">
furnaces, and &s;ets them in &s;ome place, where they may conveniently cool, and then weighs every piece over again, ob&s;erving with won|derfull exactne&s;s, what every one wants of the weight which it had, when it was fir&s;t put in, and according to the wa&s;t, that is, according to what he finds it want, of the fir&s;t weight: he gives the whole barre or ingot of metal the alloy, and markes it at what value or e&s;tima|tion of purity and finene&s;s it &s;hall pa&s;s. The ballance and weights which they u&s;e, are the mo&s;t delicate and curious in the world, and their graines &s;o &s;mall, that they cannot be ta|ken up by a mans fingers, but only with a &s;mall pair of pincers, which they have on purpo&s;e: and they make the triall for the mo&s;t part by candle light, that not &s;o much as any &s;u&s;picion of winde or aire extraordinary &s;hould inter|vene, to move the ballance one way or other. So preci&s;ely curious are they in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and not altogether without cau&s;e, for upon the e&s;timate of this little piece, the value and judgement of the whole barre, or ingot, for purity and finene&s;s, dependeth, as hath been &s;aid.</P>

for the Princes of the Catholique Monarchy, and for the defence of the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> And though it be only one mountain or hill of it &s;elf, with a little hillock growing out at the foot of it, yet is it &s;o infinitely rich, that it &s;eemes to be all of &s;ilver, and would doubtle&s;s of it &s;elf alone, be a &s;ufficient &s;upport and re|venue for any Prince in Chri&s;tendome what|&s;oever, that had it by him at home in his owne dominions.

A certain American of <HI>Chumbivilca,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> named <HI>Gualpa,</HI> was hunting thereabouts for veni&s;on; and being forced to u&s;e his hands to climbe up a part of the mountain that was rocky, and had &s;ome few bu&s;hes growing upon it, by chance laid hold upon a little &s;hrub, which grew out of a vein of the &s;ilver, and &s;trained him&s;elfe &s;o much to get up, that he pulled up the branch by the roots, perceiving in the hole or place where the root grew, &s;ome quantity of metal; which upon better veiw and &s;ome experience he had of the Mines at <HI>Porco,</HI> not above &s;ix leagues di&s;tant from thence, he found to be very good: whereupon he began to look better about him, and found pre&s;ently &s;catter'd up and down on the &s;urface of the earth, &s;everall other pieces of the &s;ame metall, but a little changed in colour, by rea&s;on they had lain o|pen (a long time perhaps) to the rain and wea|ther; which yet only upon carrying to <HI>Porco,</HI> he quickly found to be good metal, and what a brave fortune he had met with by his hun|ting. And for &s;ome time he managed his bu|&s;ine&s;s warily and happily, drawing &s;ilver con|tinually
<PB N="214" REF="117">
out of his Mine, as much as he could de&s;ire. But it was not long before a compani|on, or friend of his, who&s;e name was <HI>Guanca,</HI> perceived &s;o much of it, that he made &s;hift to become Sharer with him in the Mine: and &s;o they two enjoyed for a while the riche&s;t Mine in the world; and might have done &s;o much longer but for their own covetuou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;&s;ention. It happened that the part of the Mine, which this New-comer <HI>Guanca</HI> had cho|&s;en proved not &s;o much to his liking, as he ex|pected, and therefore he de&s;ired to &s;hare in common with <HI>Gualpa</HI> in his Mine; which was not better metal than the others was, but more ea&s;ie to get forth: but <HI>Gualpa</HI> refu&s;ed; and the other was &s;o much provoked upon it, that, being but a Servant to one <HI>Villaroel</HI> a Spaniard of <HI>Porco,</HI> he pre&s;ently di&s;covers the whole bu|&s;ine&s;s to his Ma&s;ter: who thereupon making &s;earch, and finding the metall good, and the Mine likely to be rich, immediately repaires to the Kings Officers, makes known the Mine, and procures his Servant <HI>Guanca,</HI> to be enrol|led fir&s;t di&s;coverer of it, and together with him <HI>undertakes the vein,</HI> as they call it, that is, procures &s;o much land about the Mine to be marked out and allotted, as the Law alloweth unto tho&s;e that fir&s;t di&s;cover a Mine, which is
<PB N="215" REF="117">
&s;ome certain yeards round about the plot, and to tho&s;e that will undertake to dig and &s;earch it. By this means they become Lords of the Mine, having liberty to dig and draw forth the &s;ilver as their own, paying the King his Tribute, which is the fifth part of what they draw forth.</P>
<P N="4">4. There were pre&s;ently upon this three or four other principal veins of the Mine di&s;co|vered upon this Mountain; of which, that which is called <HI>the rich one</HI> they report, that at fir&s;t it ran along in a ridge, above the &s;urface of the earth or plain ground, the full height of a Lance, three hundred foot together in length, and thirteen or fourteen foot broad, continu|ing likewi&s;e in this proportion of bounty and richne&s;s above fiftie or three&s;core &s;tades, or &s;o many times the height of a man within ground, They had digged by the year 1588. two hun|dred &s;tades deep into the ground, &s;till follow|ing the Mine; which becau&s;e it runs not di|rectly downward, but &s;loping &s;omewhat in the mountain, they &s;uppo&s;e it will be above a thou|&s;and or twelve hundred &s;tades before they come at the root of the Mine, or the foot of the hill. This Mine yeelded at the fir&s;t one hundred and fifty, or two hundred thou&s;and <HI>pezos</HI> every week into the Regi&s;ter of the
<PB N="216" REF="118">
Contractation hou&s;e, as they call it, and the King, by the year above-&s;aid, had received out of it no le&s;s than a hundred millions of pieces of A&s;&s;ay, that is, if I under&s;tand my Author aright, &s;o many millions of &s;uch pieces as they carrie to the A&s;&s;ay-ma&s;ter, to be tryed and marked by him, when it is refined: which helps well to verifie what he &s;aith in another place, that in the Fleet of the year 1587, in which <HI>Aco&s;ta,</HI> came from the Indies, there came along with it eleven millions of Trea&s;ure, of which neer the one half belonged to the King. The labour in the&s;e Mines, as I intimated be|fore, is exce&s;&s;ively difficult and hard, the Aire they have very gro&s;s, extreme cold and un|whol&s;ome for any body not u&s;ed to it: they work night and day without cea&s;ing, only by Candle-light, without other knowledge or di&s;tinction of day and night, &s;ave what they gather by their work, or by their wearines, and de&s;ire to be at re&s;t. But that which &s;eems mo&s;t grievous of all is the labour and danger of carrying the metal out of the Mines; which they doe thus. They have Ladders of three branches or rows, made of Neats hides, &s;o &s;trongly twi&s;ted in thongs, that it yeelds not to wood for &s;trength or toughne&s;s, and &s;uppo|&s;ed to endure the aire of the Mines longer
<PB N="217" REF="118">
than wood would doe; the&s;e are commonly ten &s;tades high, and at the foot of them there is a kinde of Scaffold or &s;tage built in form of a Gallery, with &s;eats and other conveniences, to re&s;t upon. The rows of the Ladders are &s;o framed together with wood, &amp; at &s;uch di&s;tance, that, if occa&s;ion be, they may both mount and de&s;cend together. Every man carries the weight of fifty or three&s;core pound of metal upon his back, tyed up in a Wallet or cloath, in &s;uch manner ca&s;t over and fa&s;tened to his head, as he is &s;ure enough for lo&s;ing his charge, and the whole weight of the metal re&s;teth up|on his &s;houlders behinde. They mount com|monly three and three together, the fore-man carrying the light, which is a candle &s;o fa&s;tened to the thumb of one of his hands, as he may u&s;e all the other part of his hand to hold by; which is more than needs. For many times, in &s;uch great altitude, going or coming, their hold &s;lips, or by &s;ome other mi&s;chance, the poor Miners come to the ground &s;ooner than they would, lo&s;ing their lives by the fall, or at lea&s;t are &s;o maimed and broken with it, that many times death were better than life to them. This was at fir&s;t the manner of working and laboring in the Mines at <HI>Potozi,</HI> till they had digged in &s;everal veins above two hundred
<PB N="218" REF="119">
&s;tades deep within ground: Since that time, to remedie the inconveniences and trou|ble that came by carrying out the metal at the Top of the Mine in &s;o great an height, they have invented <HI>Soccabons,</HI> as they call them, which are certain counter-Mines, as it were, wrought in from the &s;ides or lower parts of the mountain, in a level line towards that part of the mountain where the vein of the metal runs, and to which the Mine that was begun at the top is brought. By this means they enter the Mines now to work, and export the me|tal with much more ea&s;e, and le&s;s danger than formerly, both at <HI>Potozi</HI> and all other places generally, where there are Mines. The&s;e <HI>Soc|cabons,</HI> or cro&s;s-Mines, are commonly about eight or ten foot in bredth, and &s;omewhat more than a &s;tade in height; which they keep &s;hut at &s;everal places with dores, for the &s;ecu|rity of the pa&s;&s;age. One of them, <HI>viz.</HI> that which was made to meet <HI>the rich vein,</HI> as they call it, is &s;aid to have been above twenty yeers in the digging and making; containing well nigh three hundred yards in length, before it came at the vein of metal; in all which way they were forced to make their pa&s;&s;age and work through the hard and flinty bowels of the mountain, with exce&s;&s;ive toyle and labour;
<PB N="219" REF="119">
and the <HI>Soccabons</HI> of the other Mines co&s;t not much le&s;s either of time or pains: So great charges, pains, and peril, are men content to be at for a thing of naught; for that which is no|thing el&s;e, for the mo&s;t part to them, but an in&s;trument of trouble, vexation, and &s;in.</P>
<P N="5">5. Something mu&s;t be &s;aid likewi&s;e (before we leave this &s;ubject) of the Jemmes and pre|cious Stones, that are found at the <HI>New World,</HI> they being &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the riches and wealth of it. The&s;e are chiefly (at lea&s;t for ought I yet perceive) Emralds and Pearls; of which there is &s;o great plenty at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> that the aboundance of them makes them the le&s;s e&s;teemed, verifying herein a pretty pa&s;&s;age of &s;torie, reported to have happened betwixt a Spaniard of the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies,</HI> and an Italian in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Spaniard was newly come from <HI>America</HI> richly fraighted, having brought over with him, among&s;t other things of value, a great quantity of fair and goodly Emralds; whereof &s;hewing one (a ve|ry fair &s;tone) to the Italian, who he knew had skill, and u&s;ed to deale in &s;uch commodities, he asked what it was worth? The Italian, up|on &s;ight of it, an&s;wered roundly, he thought it worth one hundred Duckets. Being &s;hew|ed another of more exqui&s;ite lu&s;tre and form,
<PB N="220" REF="120">
he prized it at three hundred: Whereupon the Spaniard, having good &s;tore of them, and tickled with hopes of extraordinary gain by them, would needs carrie the Merchant home to his lodging, and &s;hewed him a casket full of them. The Italian &s;eeing &s;uch a quantity of them together, Sir, &s;aid he, If you have &s;uch &s;tore, I will give you crowns apiece for them, and they will not be worth much more either to you or me: intimating thereby, that &s;tones are chiefly e&s;timated according to the raritie and &s;car&s;ne&s;s of them: which was very true, though it grieved the Spaniard not a little. The Emrald, according to the report of <HI>Pliny,</HI> if it be a right and perfect &s;tone of that kinde, is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and delight&s;ome Jem to the eye that is, of an exqui&s;ite verdure or green colour; yea, they &s;ay, it is not only agre|able and plea&s;eth the &s;ight very much, but that it attracts it al&s;o with a &s;trange kinde of effi|cacie, &s;o as a man &s;eems not &s;atisfied with look|ing upon it, but de&s;ires to view it &s;till more and more; that it fortifieth the facultie vi|&s;ive, and re&s;toreth it when it is dim and de|cayed by overmuch attent looking upon any thing: and therefore Lapidaries, and men that cut or engrave fine &s;tones, have u&s;ually &s;ome of them lying by them, only to refre&s;h and
<PB N="221" REF="120">
revive their &s;ight, when they perceive it fail them, or grow weak at any time. To which end, <HI>viz.</HI> the better to plea&s;e and affect the &s;ight, they are &s;hap'd or cut, for the mo&s;t part with &s;ome hollowne&s;s in them, whereby the <HI>vi&s;ual rayes,</HI> as they are called, being united and &s;trengthened one with another, doe give the greater lu&s;tre. They are &s;aid to appear both fairer and bigger at a di&s;tance, nor doe they change or abate their lu&s;tre, either for Sun, &s;hade, candle-light, or otherwi&s;e, as mo&s;t of the other &s;orts of Jemmes u&s;ually doe, more or le&s;s: and as they are commonly of the big|ne&s;s, &s;o are they not much under the value of a Diamond, if they be of the be&s;t and perfect &s;ort of Emralds: For all are not &s;uch. There are &s;ome of &s;o exqui&s;ite and admirable lu&s;tre, as nothing can be de&s;ired more; in others the green is more dark and clowded: and la&s;tly, &s;ome are &s;potted; but tho&s;e are commonly held to be counterfeit. Tho&s;e which the for|tunate <HI>Cortez,</HI> after the conque&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> pre&s;ented to his new Spou&s;e, the Lady <HI>Jane Zuniga,</HI> were extraordinary, and thought to be the rare&s;t in the World. They were five of them, of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite colour and perfection; and of &s;uch bigne&s;s, that they were wrought into &s;everal figures and &s;hapes of things: <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="121">
one in the fa&s;hion of a Coronet, or little Crown; another of a Ro&s;e, fair and great; the third was like to a Fi&s;h, with the eyes of gold, counted an admirable piece of Indian work; the fourth was wrought in the fa&s;hion of a Bell, having for its clapper a great and rich pearl, engraven round about with this Motto, <HI>Sea Bendito qui te criava,</HI> in Engli&s;h, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that created thee;</HI> the fifth was like a Cup, with the foot and brim of gold, and four little chains of gold, all joyning to|gether at the top or cover of it, in a great pearl. 'Tis &s;aid that the Merchants of <HI>Genoa</HI> offered no le&s;s &s;umme than 40000. Duckets for one of them, which they would have pre&s;ented to the great Turk; but were refu&s;ed: And though I confe&s;s there be &s;ome of much greater bigne&s;s mentioned in <HI>Pliny,</HI> yet doubtle&s;s the&s;e were very rare &s;tones both for bigne&s;s, workman&s;hip, and perfection. They grow u&s;ually in other &s;tones like to Chry&s;tal, and the greate&s;t plenty of them is in the new Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> and in the Province of <HI>Veragua,</HI> and e&s;pecially about the Citties of <HI>Manta</HI> and <HI>Port Vieil;</HI> where there is a whole Country, or little Pro|vince, which they call <HI>de las E&s;maldas,</HI> or <HI>the Land of Emralds,</HI> from the aboundance of them, that are &s;uppo&s;ed to be there, and which
<PB N="223" REF="121">
the Spaniards had not yet &s;ubdued, when my Author wrote: and they &s;end u&s;ually three or four hundred weight of this kinde of Jemmes only into <HI>Spain,</HI> one yeer with another.</P>
<P N="6">6. Of Pearls, which anciently were counted the only Jemme, both for price and excellency, and &s;uch as Princes only, and per&s;ons of very noble quality u&s;ed, there is &s;uch plenty of them at the new World, that the very Negro Ser|vants, or She &s;laves, are &s;aid to weare Chains and Bracelets of them. The&s;e grow in Oy&s;ters, or a certain &s;hel-Fi&s;h much re&s;embling Oy|&s;ters, and bearing that name; and are fetcht up from the bottom of the Sea by the poor Indians that are forced to dive for them. 'Tis true, the Indians, through nece&s;&s;ity and cu|&s;tome, are become wonderfully apt and ready at this work, even almo&s;t beyond beleefe. They will de&s;cend commonly ten or twenty fathom deep into the water, and &s;tay there an houre, or the better part of an houre, plucking the &s;hel-fi&s;hes from the hard Rocks, or &s;earching for them in the gravelly corners and chinks under water, till they have filled the &s;atchels or baggs which they carried down with them; or that want of breath enforceth them to come up. Howbeit if the Sea be very deep, or not calm, they finde much difficultie to
<PB N="224" REF="122">
abide under water, and therefore tye common|ly certain &s;tones of good weight about them, only to keep them down, which are exceeding painfull to them all the time they are under water, be&s;ide the danger they are in to be de|&s;troyed by the Tyburons, and other preying fi&s;hes, whiles they are there. But when they have a minde to come up, 'tis but unloo&s;ing of the &s;tones, and they mount pre&s;entiy, being counted the mo&s;t expert Swimmers in the World: To which likewi&s;e their own dry, wi|ther'd, and lean complexions doe di&s;po&s;e them very much; being, for the mo&s;t part, of very thin and &s;pare bodies, and dyeted on purpo&s;e for this &s;ervice, with the drye&s;t meat which their hard Ma&s;ters can procure for them, and that al&s;o in &s;mall quantity and with but &s;cant allowance. The Pearls differ much from one another, both in fa&s;hion, colour, bigne&s;s, and poli&s;hing, and they &s;eldom finde two of them altogether alike: when they doe, it much en|haunceth the price and e&s;timation of them, even where they are mo&s;t common; a pair of &s;uch Pearls having been valued, at the In|dies them&s;elves, at a thou&s;and Duckets. They are counted the mo&s;t excellent which are of an Orient white colour, bright and cleer, like the fine&s;t Allom, bigge, weighty, and e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="225" REF="122">
if they be round; which is counted &s;uch a &s;ingular raritie in this Gem, that <HI>Oviedo</HI> tells us of him&s;elf, he once bought a Pearl at the Indies, not much bigger than the pellet of &s;ome Cro&s;s bow, for which he gave 650. times the weight of it in good gold, upon no other &s;pecial account, but only be|cau&s;e it was round. They fi&s;h for Pearls upon all the coa&s;ts of <HI>America,</HI> and the I&s;lands ge|nerally more or le&s;s, but e&s;pecially in the South-Sea about <HI>Panama</HI> and the I&s;land <HI>Mar|garita,</HI> &s;o called from the aboundance of them which they have found there: and in the North-Sea, about the I&s;lands of <HI>Cumana, Cu|bagna, Rio de la Hacha,</HI> and other places, which are commonly found bigger than tho&s;e of the South Sea. And although it be the opi|nion of &s;ome, grounded upon the covetou&s;|ne&s;s of the Spaniards, when they fir&s;t came in|to tho&s;e parts (who &s;pared not the very feed or mother of the Pearl it &s;elf, but &s;wept &amp; took all that came to hand) that the profit of Pearl-fi&s;hing is much decayed, of what it was; yet if it be true what the &s;ame <HI>Oviedo</HI> tells us, I &s;hould think it may be otherwi&s;e, and the trade good &s;till. For he &s;aith, The&s;e Pearl-Oy&s;ters come by &s;hoals &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into the places where they are u&s;ually taken; and that
<PB N="226" REF="123">
though a bank in the Sea be &s;wept never &s;o clean of them by the Pearl-fi&s;hers, yet not far off they finde alwaies more, and likewi&s;e in the &s;ame place good plenty of them again in a &s;hort time.</P>

<P>Of <HI>E&s;totiland,</HI> and the &s;everal Provinces which it containeth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe fir&s;t Province of the Continent of <HI>America</HI> towards the North, is called <HI>E&s;totiland;</HI> for what rea&s;on I mu&s;t plainly confe&s;s, I cannot &s;o cleerly di&s;cover; unle&s;s perhaps our Neighbours the Duch happened to have the fir&s;t naming of it, and that it beareth any &s;ignification of its Ea&s;terly lying in re&s;pect of the other Provinces. It containeth all tho&s;e Regions of the Mexican or Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> which lye fur|the&s;t toward the North Ea&s;t: on which &s;ide, as likewi&s;e more directly Ea&s;tward, it is wa&s;h|ed all along with the main Ocean, or North-Sea; having on the South <HI>Canada,</HI> or <HI>new France:</HI> We&s;tward, and to the North-we&s;t, it is not yet fully di&s;covered: but &s;uppo&s;ed either to be joyned to &s;ome parts of <HI>Tartary,</HI> or (which I think is the more common con|jecture to be divided from it by the Sea: which &s;ome, pre&s;uming it to be but a narrow Sea, call <HI>the Streits of Anian,</HI> from a Province or part of the <HI>A&s;iatique Tartary,</HI> which beareth
<PB N="234" REF="127">
that name, and lyeth upon it. On the North it hath a Bay, or large Inlet of the Sea, which the Engli&s;h call <HI>Hud&s;ons Streites</HI> from Capt. <HI>Henry Hud&s;on</HI> an Engli&s;hman, who in the yeare 1610 is &s;aid to have &s;ailed in this Sea no le&s;s then three hundred leagues We&s;tward, in &s;earch of a pa&s;&s;age that way to the Kingdomes of <HI>Catha</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> of which we have &s;poken already, and which was &s;o much endeavoured in tho&s;e times both by our &s;elves and our neigh|bours the Duch: but without &s;ucce&s;s hither|to. The whole Province containeth the&s;e par|ticular Countries, if I may &s;o call them, or Prefect&s;hips, as &s;ome others doe, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, <HI>E|&s;totiland</HI> more properly &s;o called. Secondly, <HI>Terra Corterialis.</HI> Thirdly, New-found land, and Fourthly certain I&s;lands neer adjoyning to the Continent, which they call <HI>Bacca|leos.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>E&s;totiland</HI> &s;pecially &s;o called, is the mo&s;t Northerly region of all <HI>America</HI> towards the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> lying betwixt the above&s;aid <HI>Hud&s;ons Sreights,</HI> which it hath on the <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> on the <HI>South.</HI> The &s;oil of the country is &s;aid to be rea&s;onably good, and well &s;tored with naturall Commodities, I mean, &s;uch as are of nece&s;&s;ity and may be expected in &s;uch a cold northerly quarter, as Fle&s;h, fowl,
<PB N="235" REF="127">
and good &s;tore of Fi&s;h in the Sea. Among the Natives of the country there, and &s;ome Savage that live wild up and down in the Woods, and go naked, not with&s;tanding the extream cold: but for the mo&s;t part, they are &s;uppo&s;ed at lea&s;t to be more civill. The fir&s;t di&s;coverers of the country reporting of them, that they both &s;ow corn, brew Beer and Ale, u&s;e <HI>Canoas</HI> or little Boats at Sea, by which they trade with <HI>Greenland, Freezland,</HI> and other parts at one thou&s;and or five hundred miles di&s;tance from them. They are &s;aid likwi&s;e to have &s;ome u&s;e of letters, but of a Character proper only to their own Nation, and not under&s;tood by any o|ther people be&s;ide them&s;elves. Yea they talk likewi&s;e, as if they had &s;ome knowledge of the Latin tongue; and of certain Latin books in a Library of one of the Kings of the Country: wherein, if there be any thing of truth, (as I hold it not altogether impo&s;&s;ible) 'tis likely, &s;ome people from the more Northerly parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that under&s;tood the Latin tongue, might in times pa&s;t be ca&s;t on &s;hore, or &s;uffer Shipwrack upon tho&s;e Coa&s;ts; where being con&s;trained to live and abide, they might leave &s;ome books, and other monuments of the Lan|guage behind them in the Country after their decea&s;e. However it be, this &s;eems more cer|tain,
<PB N="236" REF="128">
by the report and experience of &s;ome Engli&s;h, that the people are generally here found to be more ingenious, to have better judgement in things, and to be much more skilfull in divers Mechanicall arts, then u&s;ually in the&s;e other parts of <HI>America</HI> they were at fir&s;t. Among other things they were ob&s;erved to u&s;e a kinde of Dart, or &s;hort Ja|velin, pointed with bright &s;teel and very &s;harp: which being a kinde of Weapon u&s;ed only by the people of <HI>Java,</HI> and &s;ome other of the I&s;lands of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> it is conjectured, that they have commerce one with another: which &s;eems not altogether improbable. But as for the Towns, Citties and great Ca&s;tles a|mong them, which &s;ome &s;peak of, and of the Temples, wherein they &s;acrificed men, (though that be an ancient and generall cu&s;tome among the Americans, and tho&s;e of this Country bar|barous enough to doe it) yet the Reader per|haps will be willing to &s;u&s;pend his beleefe a while: as likewi&s;e he will, for the &s;uppo&s;ed Mines of gold and &s;ilver there: of which (at lea&s;t as it may &s;eem) the Northerly &s;cituation of the Country doth not well permit us to have &s;uch &s;trong pre&s;umption. Of Bra&s;s and Iron, 'tis likely enough there may be good &s;tore, if the Country were &s;carched. But as
<PB N="237" REF="128">
yet the knowledge thereof, e&s;pecially concer|ning the more Inland parts; remains very im|perfect. Some Engli&s;h Adventurers pa&s;&s;ing that way, have left names to certain Capes or Head-lands upon the Northern Coa&s;ts of it, and that is all: the chief of which are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Cape <HI>Elizabeth</HI> at the entrance into <HI>Hud|&s;ons Streights</HI> Northward. Prince <HI>Henries</HI> Foreland. Cape <HI>Charles.</HI> Kings Foreland with with divers others, more to the <HI>South.</HI> Cape <HI>Wo&s;tenholme</HI> and <HI>Digges</HI> his I&s;land about the mouth of the Streight; where it opens it &s;elf and di&s;embogues into a large and capacious Bay, called (as above&s;aid) <HI>Hud&s;ons Bay,</HI> and dividing the&s;e uttermo&s;t Provinces of the Northern <HI>America</HI> into two parts, which &s;ome call the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern point; as may be &s;een in the Maps. The people of the Country, that are any thing civilized, cloath them&s;elves commonly with Bea&s;ts skins, and with the skins of the Sea-calves otherwi&s;e called <HI>Mor|&s;es;</HI> which are a kinde of Fi&s;h of an Amphibi|ous nature, much abounding in tho&s;e Nor|thern Seas, of the bigne&s;s of a young Heifer, or Bullock of two yeares old, which they hunt and take in great numbers, e&s;peciall where the Whale-fi&s;hing is not &s;o good; and draw a good quantity of oile from them, which they
<PB N="238" REF="129">
call <HI>Train-oile,</HI> as they doe from the Whale. The fle&s;h of them is counted rea&s;onable good meat, of a ta&s;te &s;omewhat like Porke: and on each &s;ide of their upper Jaw there groweth out a long tooth, or Tusk, crooked and ben|ding downward, not unlike to that of an Ele|phant, each of them a Cubit long &s;ometimes and more, of a &s;ub&s;tance white and very hard like Ivory; for which it commonly pa&s;&s;eth. And it were well, if the deceit re&s;ted there, and went no further. For as it &s;eems, there are &s;ome that vend it for Unicorns horn and attri|bute I know not what &s;trange and &s;overeign vertues to it. An egregious impo&s;ture, of which the learned Doctor <HI>Brown</HI> doth likewi&s;e (as his manner is) acutely and kindly admoni&s;h us. <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>chap.</HI> 23. of his <HI>P&s;udodox.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> is a Province, or Country of this Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> ly|ing Southward of <HI>E&s;totiland,</HI> and Northward of <HI>New-France</HI> or <HI>Canada,</HI> being &s;o named from <HI>Ga&s;par Corterialis</HI> a Portughe&s;e Gentle|man, who in the yeare 1500 or there|abouts fir&s;t di&s;covered the&s;e parts, and gave name to the Country; but did not much be|&s;ide. For returning the next yeare after, with intention to make a further di&s;covery, 'tis &s;up|po&s;ed

This was about the year 1504. The &s;oil of this Country is very lu&s;ty and good, for all &s;orts of grain ge|nerally, and yeelds a great advantage to the Husbandman, but not without good pains ta|king in the tillage and managing of it: For which rea&s;on it is called by &s;ome <HI>Terra di la|brador,</HI> or the land that requires Labourers; in allu&s;ion perhaps to <HI>Terra di lavora,</HI> or the Country of <HI>Campania</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;o called from a like property. The people of the Country, of them&s;elves barbarous and &s;avage enough, are &s;aid to be civilized and bettered in their man|ners by the conver&s;ation of the French. They live much upon Fi&s;h, are excellent Archers,
<PB N="240" REF="130">
jealous of their Wives, and dwell for the mo&s;t part in Caves under ground; beeing al&s;o much given to Sooth&s;aying &amp; Divining; further than which they &s;eem not to have much knowledge, or &s;ence of any thing that concerns religion. The Country was fir&s;t of all di&s;covered by Sir <HI>Seba&s;tion Cabot,</HI> at the charges of <HI>Henery</HI> the &s;eventh, King of <HI>England,</HI> as hath been &s;aid; but it was only di&s;covered, and the de&s;ign laid wholly a&s;ide, by rea&s;on of &s;ome dome&s;tick troubles, and a Warre which the King then had with the Scots: whereupon the After|comers tooke leave to enter. The Towns or places, which the French have built &s;ince, are cheifly, 1. <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> 2. <HI>St. Marie,</HI> and 3. <HI>Cabo Marzo,</HI> as they call it; of which there is little more to be &s;aid.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> or <HI>New-found land,</HI> the third part of this Northerly Province of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> is a great I&s;land, lying on the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Corterialis,</HI> from which it is divided by a Frith, or narrow Sea, which the French call <HI>Golf de Cha&s;tieux.</HI> This place is chiefly frequented for fi&s;hing; of which there is &s;uch plenty all along the Coa&s;ts of this I&s;land, and likewi&s;e of <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> adjoyning to it, that the huge Shoales of Cod-fi&s;h doe &s;ometimes &s;tay their Ships under &s;ail: be&s;ides great &s;tore of other

fi&s;h, both of &s;alt water and fre&s;h, as namely Herrings, Salmons, Thornback, Smelts, ex|cellent Oy&s;ters, and Mu&s;cles that are &s;aid to have a kinde of Pearl in them; but of what quality or value, doth not &s;o well appear. The Land within is likewi&s;e reported to be a very good Countrie, plentifully &s;tored with Deer and other &s;orts of Veni&s;on, Phe&s;ants, Par|tridges, Swans, with variety of other good Fowl; la&s;tly of a temperate Aire and Soile, not barren: only the people of it are &s;aid to be few, and to inhabit chiefly the We&s;tern and North-we&s;t parts of it. But this perhaps may be rather out of fear, and to avoid the conver&s;ation of Strangers; which at fir&s;t they would not endure but fled at the &s;ight of them, being them&s;elves altogether Savage and wilde. But &s;ince 'tis &s;aid, they grow more tractable, and will be hired, in time of yeer, by the Por|tughe&s;es, and other Nations that fi&s;h com|monly for Whales in the Bay of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and other places thereabouts, to help them in the opening of their Whales, boyling the fi&s;h, and drawing out the Oyle; wherein they that will be got to it, are extremely diligent and ready to take pains. They are commonly of but mean &s;tature, full eyed, &s;omewhat broad|faced, and for the mo&s;t part beardle&s;s. Their
<PB N="242" REF="131">
hou&s;es are only certain long Poles, &s;et an end &s;loping upwards towards the top, where they are fa&s;tened together, and covered down|wards with the skins of Bea&s;ts, having in the mid'&s;t their hearth, or place to make fire upon. But that which is mo&s;t remarkable about this I&s;land, is the many and fair Havens which it affordeth on all &s;ides for &s;hipping: in which re&s;pect it is though, for the bigne&s;s, &s;car&s;ely to be paralleld by any other I&s;land or Place in the World: not indeed beautified with any great Towns, or &s;tately buildings, as &s;ome are, but affording commodious and &s;ecure &s;tation for the talle&s;t &s;hips that come before it; the chief whereof are the&s;e: 1. <HI>La Roigneu&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Renno&s;a,</HI> as it is called, &s;ix leagues Northward of the <HI>Cape Raye,</HI> which lyeth at the South-Ea&s;t angle of the I&s;land; a place much re|&s;orted unto for fi&s;hing, from all parts. 2. <HI>Por|tus formo&s;us,</HI> or the fair Haven, three miles Northward of the other; capable of great &s;hips, and bearing at lea&s;t four or five miles within Land, or more. 3. <HI>Thornbay,</HI> called otherwi&s;e by the Portughe&s;es <HI>En&s;eada grande,</HI> or the great Bay, for di&s;tinction &s;ake. 4. <HI>Tri|nity Bay,</HI> on the North of the Cape <HI>St. Fran|cis,</HI> called by the Spaniards <HI>Baia de la concep|tion.</HI> This is likewi&s;e a very large and capa|cious
<PB N="143" REF="131">
Bay, five miles over, where it is narrow|e&s;t, having diver&s;e great Rivers falling into it, and &s;ome little I&s;lands lying &s;catteringly up and down in it, yet &s;afe, and affording very good Anchorage and riding for &s;hips in mo&s;t parts. 5. <HI>Bay Blanche,</HI> as the French call it, or White-Bay, on the North of the Cape or Promontory of <HI>St. John.</HI> On the South &s;ide of the I&s;land, and We&s;tward of <HI>Cape Raye,</HI> there is, 1. <HI>Port Tre&s;pa&s;&s;e,</HI> an excellent and &s;ecure Harbour, having alwaies a rea&s;onable deep Sea, without &s;hallows or Rocks. 2. <HI>Port St. Marie,</HI> &s;ix leagues di&s;tant from it. 3. <HI>Port Pre&s;enza,</HI> by others called <HI>Placenza,</HI> on the other &s;ide of Cape <HI>St. Marie,</HI> towards the We&s;t. 4. <HI>Port du Ba&s;ques,</HI> or the Bi&s;cayners Haven; and la&s;tly on the We&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land, after you have doubled <HI>Cape Raye,</HI> there is at <HI>Georges Bay,</HI> all of them &s;ecure &s;ta|tions, large and of great re&s;ort.</P>
<P N="5">5. Before this I&s;land, right over again&s;t <HI>Cape Ray,</HI> at a di&s;tance of twenty four leagues or more, there lyeth an huge Bank or ridge of Land, extending it &s;elf in length, out of the Sea, &s;ome hundred of leagues, if my Author mi&s;take not; but in bredth not above four or five and twenty, when it is broade&s;t: and in other parts much le&s;s, &s;harpning towards

each end into a Conus or narrow point. It is counted one of the Marveils of the Sea; which round about it, at &s;ome di&s;tance, is very deep, and hardly to be &s;ounded, e&s;pecially betwixt <HI>the Bank,</HI> (for &s;o they commonly call it) and <HI>Cape Ray,</HI> but drawing neerer it grows by degrees more and more &s;hallow; in&s;omuch that nigh the Land, there is not much more water than is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;hips riding. It runneth out in length, as was &s;aid, from North to South, from fourty one degrees of latitude to fiftie two; and round about it there lye &s;cattered a multitude of le&s;&s;er I&s;lands; which Sir <HI>Seba&s;tian Cabot,</HI> when he fir&s;t di&s;|covered, the place called by one common name <HI>Los Baccaleos,</HI> or the I&s;lands of Cod-fi&s;h, from the great quantity of that &s;ort of fi&s;h hee there found: which was &s;uch, that they hindred the pa&s;&s;age of his &s;hips, and lay in &s;uch multitudes upon the Coa&s;ts, that the very Bears would come and catch them in their claws, and draw them to Land. This place, I &s;ay, with the re&s;t was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Sir <HI>Seba&s;tian Cabot,</HI> upon the Engli&s;h account; howbeit the matter happened to be lay'd a&s;ide upon the afore&s;aid occa&s;ions; till in King <HI>Henery</HI> the eight his time, it was revived again by <HI>Thorn</HI> and <HI>Eliot,</HI> two Merchants of <HI>Bri&s;toll,</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="132">
but without &s;ucce&s;s: after which the Portu|ghe&s;es, French, and other Nations, re&s;ort to it and change the names which the fir&s;t di&s;co|verers had given to the Bayes and Capes thereabouts. But the Engli&s;h not relinqui&s;h|ing their preten&s;ions of primier di&s;covery and &s;ei&s;in, about the yeer 1583 Sir <HI>Humfry Gilbert</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it again, in the name of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and prohibited all Nations the liberty of fi&s;hing there, without the Queen of <HI>Englands</HI> leave. But he being unhappily wracked in his coming home, the bu&s;ine&s;s was again di&s;continued for a time, <HI>viz.</HI> till the year 1608, when it was undertaken a new by <HI>John Guy,</HI> another Merchant of <HI>Bri&s;toll;</HI> and with &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that the Colony in a &s;hort time were well furni&s;hed with Wheat, Rye, Barley, and other grain of their own &s;owing, with Turnips, Coleworts, and aboun|dance of other nece&s;&s;ary things, not without &s;ome probable hopes of Metals, a certain and plentifull trade of Sables, Musk, and other rich Commodities, and &s;uch excellent good fi&s;h|ing, e&s;pecially for Codfi&s;h and Ling, that 'tis &s;aid &s;ome Engli&s;h-men doe ordinarily take two or three hundred of them in the &s;pace of three or four houres; which from thence they

<P>Of <HI>Canada</HI> and the Countries belonging to it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1 <HI>CAnada,</HI> or <HI>New France,</HI> is a large Province of this Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> bounded Northward with <HI>Terra Corterialis</HI> above&s;aid, and on the South with that part of <HI>Virginia</HI> which is called <HI>New Eng|land:</HI> on the Ea&s;t it is wa&s;hed with the Ocean or North Sea; the We&s;tern borders of it be|ing not yet fully di&s;covered or known. It hath its name from the River <HI>Canada,</HI> which wa|tereth the whole Province, running through the mide&s;t of it, and is counted one of the fair|e&s;t and greate&s;t Rivers of <HI>America;</HI> where yet it is &s;upppo&s;ed there are the faire&s;t and greate&s;t of all the World be&s;ide. It hath its head or &s;pring in tho&s;e undi&s;covered parts of this Nor|therly tract, which remain yet unknown; and runs generally with a large and violent &s;tream, having in it many Cataracts, or falls of the
<PB N="247" REF="133">
Water, as it were, from &s;ome Rocks lying in the channels which renders the pa&s;&s;age of it up the &s;tream extremely difficult, and down|wards no le&s;s dangerous. In &s;ome places it &s;wells and &s;preads it &s;elf out into large and huge Lakes, containing, &s;ome of them, one hundred miles in compa&s;s, and having diver&s;e &s;mall I&s;lands &s;cattered up and down in them: after which it is pre&s;ently again reduced into a narrower channel, of a league or two leagues broad generally. Thus it runneth turning and winding up and down the Country, as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ome hundred of leagues from its head-&s;pring; till at la&s;t having received into its channel many le&s;&s;er Rivers of the Countrie, it empties it &s;elf into a great Bay, which they call the Bay of St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> being at the mouth no le&s;s thin thirty or fourty leagues broad, as it is &s;aid, and one hundred and fifty fathom deep of water. The French Authors report, that it hath been actually &s;earched for above one thou&s;and two hun|dred miles and upward from the Bay: and that the Savages living thereabouts, doe &s;peak confidently, of certain Bayes of Salt-water more towards the South; and of great ve&s;&s;els which they have &s;een that way: which, if true, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be from the South Sea. But I per|ceive
<PB N="248" REF="134">
not that any farther enquiry hath been made by them about it; as doubtle&s;s a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o great importance would de&s;erve, <HI>viz.</HI> to finde &s;uch a commodious and ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age into the South Sea, and thereby to the other Indies. Therefore I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e relations are not much credited. The Countrie on both &s;ides the River, is rea&s;onably plea&s;ant and fer|til, e&s;pecially on the South or South-we&s;t of it; where it &s;eemeth to be a little mountai|nous, the ground a&s;cending, for the mo&s;t part upwards from the River, and ri&s;ing with ma|ny little hills, clad mo&s;t of them with Vines, of which there is great aboundance in the Countrie, and other trees, and divided fre|quently with other le&s;&s;er &s;treams, which at &s;e|veral places doe all of them fall into the great River. In this Countrie the French hitherto, I &s;uppo&s;e, have made the greate&s;t di&s;coveries of any other Nation; yet not the fir&s;t, but fol|lowing the tract of <HI>Corterialis</HI> and Sir <HI>Seba&s;ti|an Cabot,</HI> that went before them. The whole Country containeth the&s;e particular Provinces, or &s;ubdivi&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>New-France,</HI> more e|&s;pecially &s;o called. 2. <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> 3. <HI>Norim|begua:</HI> and 4. &s;ome I&s;lands adjoyning.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>New-France,</HI> &s;pecially &s;o called, lyeth on the North-&s;ide of the River <HI>Canada,</HI> &s;ome|what
<PB N="249" REF="134">
what inclining towards the Ea&s;t; and on the South of <HI>Terra Corterialis:</HI> but in the We|&s;tern, or more inland parts, the River divideth it in the mid&s;t, the French having &s;eated them|&s;elves on both &s;ides of it. The Countrie na|turally aboundeth with Staggs, and other &s;orts of wilde Deer, Bears, Marterns, Foxes, and Hares; of which la&s;t there is &s;uch plenty, that the French call one of the I&s;lands, <HI>I&s;le aux Lieures,</HI> or the I&s;land of Hares.

Terms, for a good while, they held it. After|wards, upon confidence, it &s;eems, of a new Governour &s;ent from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> they not only failed to pay the promi&s;ed contribution and tribute, but fell to fortifie them&s;elves, and to entitle the Merchants of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to an ab&s;olute Propriety and Dominion of the Countrie, independent of any other; building Towns, as <HI>New Am&s;terdam,</HI> rai&s;ing Forts, as <HI>Orange Fort,</HI> neer that branch of the <HI>Nordt River,</HI> which they call <HI>Hell gates.</HI> Complaint whereof being made to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and by his Emba&s;&s;ador repre&s;ented to the States, they di&s;own the bu&s;ine&s;s, and declare by publique in&s;trument, that they were not intere&s;&s;ed in it, but that it was only a private undertaking, <HI>viz.</HI> of the We&s;t Indian Company of <HI>Am|&s;terdam.</HI> Whereupon a Commi&s;&s;ion was granted to Sir <HI>George Culvert,</HI> made Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s and plant the Southern parts thereof, lying towards <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> by the name of <HI>Maryland;</HI> and to Sir <HI>Edmund Loyden</HI> to plant the Northern parts towards <HI>New-England,</HI> by the name of <HI>Nova-Albion:</HI> Which makes the Dutch the &s;econd time &s;eem willing to compound; and for the &s;umme of two thou&s;and and five hundred pounds, they offer to be gone, and leave all

they had there. But by advantage of the troubles in <HI>England,</HI> which then began to ap|pear, and &s;oon after followed, they not only goe back from their fir&s;t Propo&s;itions, and make higher demands, but al&s;o mo&s;t mi&s;chie|vou&s;ly and wickedly (as &s;ome report) they furni&s;h the Natives with Arms, and teach them the u&s;e of them, as it may be thought, expe|cting to u&s;e their help, upon occa&s;ion, again&s;t the Engli&s;h. An Act que&s;tionle&s;s of very per|nicious con&s;equence, not only to the Engli&s;h Adventurers, who have &s;ince been much damni|fied and prejudiced by the &s;aid Natives in their Plantations, but al&s;o to the Dutch them&s;elves; who, as 'tis reported, were the fir&s;t, or with the fir&s;t, that &s;marted by it: The Savages, being thus arm'd and train'd, fir&s;t of all falling foule upon them, de&s;troying their Farm-hou&s;es, and forcing them to betake them&s;elves to their Forts and Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es: So that at pre&s;ent there is but little good account can be gi|ven further of the State of this Coun|trie.</P>
<P>As to the nature and quality of the &s;oil, it differeth not much from the parts about it; the temperature of the aire and commodities of the Country being generally the &s;ame, which <HI>New-England</HI> or <HI>Virginia</HI> yeeldeth. And as

for Towns and places of abode, it doth not appeare, that either the Engli&s;h or Dutch have as yet &s;et them&s;elves much to building in this Country. What the Engli&s;h had done before our late troubles at home, it may be feared, is wholly ruined by the misfortunes which befell them there: And for the Dutch, although they make large reports of the Country, and chal|lenge a huge Circuit of land under the name of the <HI>New-Netherlands,</HI> and title of the States; yet I &s;uppo&s;e they have had their hands &s;o full of other bu&s;ine&s;s of late, that they have not added much to what they had, when our troubles began; which was only <HI>New-Am|&s;terdam,</HI> as they call it, and <HI>Orange-Fort,</HI> afore mentioned; nor is it &s;o certain, whither they be Ma&s;ter of them at this day or no. In &s;tead of Rivers, which this Country &s;eemeth a little to want, there are many large and capacious Bayes all along the Coa&s;t: the principall whereof are, that which the Dutch call <HI>Na&s;&s;o|vius-Bay,</HI> &s;ometimes the <HI>Nordt-river,</HI> which falleth by it into the Sea at <HI>May-port.</HI> 2. <HI>Hell|gate,</HI> which is but a Channell of the great <HI>Nordt-river,</HI> &s;o called by rea&s;on of its difficult and dangerous entrance; though within it a|ffords a very &s;afe road for &s;hipping, and fifteen or &s;ixteen fathom of water at the mouth.

It is a Country generally well di&s;tingui&s;hed into Hills and Valleys: the fir&s;t whereof are well cloathed with Woods, and

The &s;oile being &s;o good, that 'tis &s;aid in many places, an acre of land well husbanded will return two hundred bu|&s;hels, or twenty five quarter of good grain: rich in veins of Allom, as likewi&s;e in Pitch, Turpentine, Oile, plenty of &s;weet Gummes, and &s;everall &s;orts of plants for Dyers u&s;e: not wanting many good Mines of Iron, Copper, &amp;c.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> and the Provinces thereto belonging.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NEw-Gallicia</HI> is the mo&s;t Norther|ly Countrie of all <HI>America,</HI> that is inhabited to any purpo&s;e by the Spaniards. Here 'tis true, they are &s;cattered up and down in all the parts of it; but it is at a huge di&s;tance, and for the mo&s;t part only where the Mines are. It is bounded on the Ea&s;t and to the South with the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>New-Spain:</HI> on the We&s;t with the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Califormia.</HI> Northward, for &s;o much as is yet di&s;covered, with <HI>Quivira</HI> and <HI>Cibola;</HI> lying between eighteen and twenty eight degrees of Northern latitude, that is, from <HI>La Natividad,</HI> a Port &s;o named by the Spaniards, in the con|fines of <HI>New-Spain,</HI> to the mo&s;t Northerly borders of <HI>Cinoloa,</HI> a part of this Province; containing, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, not much le&s;s than three hundred leagues in length, and in bredth much more; and whereof not a tenth part is either u&s;ed or frequented by the Spaniards: The Aire is generally here very temperate, in|clining rather to heat than cold, and &s;ubject
<PB N="305" REF="162">
now and then to &s;odain &s;torms of rain and great claps of thunder; which yet doe not hin|der, but that the Countrie is held to be rea&s;o|nably healthfull, and the people ob&s;erved to live generally to a good old age. The Soil, by rea&s;on of the Climate, would be a little in|clining to drought, but that be&s;ide the fre|quent rains which it hath, it is con&s;tantly moi&s;tned with fre&s;h morning dews; which make it for the mo&s;t part wonderfully fruitfull, almo&s;t beyond beleef: yeelding for every bu|&s;hel of Wheat that is &s;own three&s;core; and of <HI>Maiz</HI> two hundred for one: be&s;ide great plenty of Sugar-Canes and Cochineel; both which, notwith&s;tanding the Spaniards are &s;aid to neglect in &s;ome &s;ort, imploying them&s;elves wholly about richer Commodities. For the Countrie affords them good &s;tore of Mines, <HI>viz.</HI> of Sylver and Bra&s;s; but of Gold or Iron, not many as yet have been found: the Rivers plentifully abounding with Fi&s;h, and the Woods with Veni&s;on and &s;ome other wilde Bea&s;ts. The Countrie generally more moun|tainous than plain, frequently &s;haded with Woods and whole Forre&s;ts of the &s;tatelye&s;t Pine trees and Oaks of timber that are to be &s;een. The People are &s;aid to be &s;omewhat of a wavering and incon&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition, apt to

The rea&s;on whereof in part is conceived to be a natural &s;lothfulne&s;s and unwillingne&s;s unto any kinde of labour in this People; which they labour mo&s;t of all to avoid, and are &s;o wi&s;e, that they never will be brought to it, but upon good wages: but on the contrary, given to &s;ports very much, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;inging, dancing, and drinking out of mea&s;ure; in &s;o much as 'tis thought, if it were not for their beloved liquor, they would hardly be per|&s;waded long to take either the care or the pains of Husbandry. They are of &s;tature rea&s;onably tall, dwelling both in Towns and Villages; be|ing di&s;tingui&s;hed into certain Clans or Tribes; each whereof is governed by one <HI>Chief,</HI> but all of them &s;ubject to the Judges and Officers of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> It contains in it the&s;e in|feriour Provinces, 1. <HI>Cinoloa.</HI> 2. <HI>Couliacan.</HI> 3. <HI>Xali&s;co.</HI> 4. <HI>Guadalaiara;</HI> all of them on the We&s;tern &s;hore. 5. <HI>Zacatecas.</HI> 6. <HI>New-Bi&s;cay:</HI> and 7. <HI>New-Mexico,</HI> more within Land.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THe Kingdom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>New-Spain,</HI> was formerly, that is, be|fore the Spaniards conquer'd and di&s;membred it, much larger than now it is; for as much as it comprehended the whole Province of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> and reached from the furthe&s;t point of the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Jucatan</HI> Southward; as far as <HI>New-Bi&s;cay</HI> and the confines of <HI>Ca|liformia</HI> Northward: containing in length &s;even hundred leagues or more, and about half as much in breadth. But &s;ince the con|que&s;t by <HI>Hernando Cortez</HI> and his followers, the whole Countrie of <HI>New-Gallicia</HI> is taken from it, and made a di&s;tinct Government, or <HI>Audiencia,</HI> as the Spaniards call it, of it &s;elf. The Natives of the Countrie are of the race of the <HI>Chichimecae,</HI> a &s;avage and wilde &s;ort of People of the Province of <HI>New-Gallicia,</HI> e&s;pe|cially in the parts of <HI>New-Bi&s;cay,</HI> living in Fore&s;ts and in deep caves under ground; who&s;e po&s;terity doe &s;till at this day much trou|ble and annoy the Countrie thereabouts; not|with&s;tanding all the endeavours of the Spani|ards,

and the Garri&s;ons which they keep in tho&s;e parts on purpo&s;e to de&s;troy them. About five hundred years agoe or more, according to the account of the Mexican Annals, divers Hoards or Swarms of the&s;e <HI>Chichimecae,</HI> wea|ry, it &s;eems, of their Woods and &s;ubterrane|ous dwellings, i&s;&s;ued out into the more open Aire, and fell down in huge multitudes into the&s;e Southerly parts of <HI>America,</HI> which are now called <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>New-Spain:</HI> not all at once, but at &s;everal times, and under &s;eve|ral names, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Suchimilci, Chalcae, Te|panecae, Tla&s;caltecae,</HI> and others; who &s;ubdu|ing or driving out the People they found in tho&s;e parts, &s;eated them&s;elves in their room: And though at fir&s;t every Nation or Company of them, as they came, &s;eized upon &s;ome Pro|vince apart by them&s;elves, and held it, as it were, in Soveraignty to them&s;elves, without acknowledgement of any dependance or &s;ub|jection to their Neighbours, or tho&s;e that were there before them; yet in tract of time, and by fortune of the Warrs, which they made one upon another, they all fell under the Govern|ment of one King, <HI>viz.</HI> the King of <HI>Mexico:</HI> which was the chief City of the Province. This Kingdome, at the time that the Spaniards fir&s;t di&s;covered the Countrie, was governed
<PB N="320" REF="170">
by a Prince, named <HI>Motezuma;</HI> one, who by his valour and good &s;ucce&s;s in the warres, had in a few years of his reign, before the Spani|ards came thither, &s;ubdued the better part of a hundred Cities and great Towns to his Do|minion; and held in actual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Government, and tributary to him, no le&s;s than thirty &s;everal <HI>Ca&s;iques</HI> or petty Princes; every one of which pay'd him Tribute, and were able upon occa&s;ion to bring into the field an hundred thou&s;and men. He is &s;aid to have been, for his per&s;on, a wi&s;e and good Prince, ju&s;t, affable, and tender of his Subjects good: but by rea&s;on of &s;ome heavy exactions, which his own power and the practi&s;e of his Ance|&s;tors before him, gave him the confidence to impo&s;e upon the conquered People, a great part of his Subjects lived but unwillingly un|der his obedience, and rather by con&s;traint than otherwi&s;e: being al&s;o further exa&s;perated again&s;t him by one barbarous cu&s;tome, which the Mexicans frequently u&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sacri|ficing of men. Their manner was, when&s;oever they had any &s;olemn occa&s;ion of doing honour to their Devil-god <HI>Vitzilopuchtli,</HI> as they called him, to &s;end out an Army of men from <HI>Mexico,</HI> into &s;ome of the &s;ubdued Provinces, (in ca&s;e they had no enemies neerer hand)

and to fetch in as many men as they thought good, to be &s;acrificed; who&s;e fle&s;h likewi&s;e afterwards they did eate in a &s;olemn Banquet. This being a bu&s;ine&s;s of their Satanicall Reli|gion, and <HI>Motezuma</HI> a Prince extremely &s;u|per&s;titious and devoted to the &s;ervice of his gods, it is &s;aid, that he &s;acrificed commonly, one yeer with another, twenty thou&s;and men, and &s;ome yeers, upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, not le&s;s than fifty thou&s;and: So great and grie|vous a Tyranny, by the ju&s;t judgement and permi&s;&s;ion of Almighty God, for their great and unnatural &s;ins, did the Enemy of Man|kinde exerci&s;e upon them. He was likewi&s;e much given to Women; but it was only to &s;uch as were counted his Wives; of which he is &s;aid to have had no le&s;s than one hundred and fifty with child by him at one time.</P>

The Mexicans, provoked with the injurie and indignity offered to their King, in the mid&s;t of his Royal Citie, and in the &s;ight of his People, begin to mutiny and take Arms for the re&s;cue of their Prince. They be&s;iege the Spaniards in their hou&s;e, together with <HI>Mo|tezuma,</HI> and pre&s;s &s;o hard upon them, that the Fetters are taken off, and <HI>Motezuma's</HI> help u&s;ed for the allaying of the tumult, and quiet|ing the People: and although they keep him &s;till under guard, yet they permit him to com|mand and di&s;patch all affairs, as freely as if he were at liberty; to be attended by his Noble|men and other Servants, in the full State and dignity of a King; only he went not abroad but &s;ome guard of Spaniards were with him.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="324" REF="172">3. About this time there were certain &s;hips come to <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> which was a new Port town of this Countrie that the Spaniards had built &s;ince their coming thither, and had land|ed neer upon a thou&s;and men; which was an accident that had like to have &s;poiled the de|&s;ign of <HI>Cortez</HI> and all his Company at <HI>Mexi|co:</HI> the&s;e men being &s;ent by <HI>James Vela&s;quez,</HI> Governour of <HI>Cuba,</HI> expre&s;sly again&s;t <HI>Cortez</HI> and his men, upon pretence that they acted not conformably to the Commi&s;&s;ion which they had received from him; and gave him no account of their proceedings: which in a great part was true. For it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>Cor|tez</HI> and his men finding them&s;elves to have fallen upon an adventure that was certainly rich and good; and having got &s;uch footing and intere&s;t in the Country already, by their &s;ucce&s;s and victories, and chiefly by their con|federacy with &s;o many of the Natives and Peo|ple of the Countrie revolted to them, did al|mo&s;t at fir&s;t&punc; by a general con&s;ent, renounce their Commi&s;&s;ion and dependency upon <HI>Vela&s;quez,</HI> and profe&s;&s;ed to act immediatly from and for the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> What pre|tences they had for &s;uch a re&s;olution, &s;eemingly at lea&s;t irregular, is not &s;o well known.

But at la&s;t by advantage of the night, in which the Mexicans never u&s;e to fight, nor yet to keep any very good guard, he found a pa&s;&s;age, and made &s;hift to bring in his forces, to the great rejoycing and incouragement of his men within, who were very hard put to it

But yet their numbers were &s;uch, and &s;o infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ing his, being called in from all parts of the Kingdome not revolted, and their re&s;olution &s;uch to de&s;troy or &s;tarve the Spaniards, as they would neither admit, nor &s;o much as hear of any terms of Accommoda|tion; which <HI>Cortez</HI> profered them divers times: their general cry being nothing el&s;e, but <HI>Get you hence, deliver up the King;</HI> and calling them <HI>Enemies, Theevs, Robbers,</HI> and what not? and truly the condition of the Spa|niards was &s;uch, and the Mexicans had them &s;o much in their power, if not to kill, yet at lea&s;t to &s;tarve them, by rea&s;on of their infinite numbers, which dayly increa&s;ed, and by being &s;o much Ma&s;ters of the City both by land and water, and having broken down all, or mo&s;t of the bridges, by which only there was pa&s;&s;age out of it, that the Spaniards would gladly have been gone, if they dur&s;t: but they knew, their but offering to leave the City would be their de&s;truction. <HI>Mexico</HI> is built, like <HI>Venice,</HI> upon the water, in the mid&s;t of an huge Lake, having
<PB N="328" REF="174">
three only waies to enter it by land, which are upon three &s;everal Cau&s;eys, of a league, two leagues, and half a league long; and of but little breadth: on all other parts it is &s;urround|ed by the Lake, which by &s;undry and large Channels enters and waters the Citie in all the quarters of it; where they have draw-bridges to pull up and let down at plea&s;ure. At the&s;e pa&s;&s;es the Spaniards knew very well they &s;hould be over-power'd by their enemies; who by this time were grown &s;o re&s;olute and hardy, that they &s;eem'd not to fear or regard death, but in fight would run de&s;perately in multi|tudes even upon the mouths of the Ordinance: and doubtle&s;s but for the Hor&s;-men, which &s;tav'd them off, they would in a &s;hort time have rendred them in a manner u&s;ele&s;s, and have choak'd them up (as it were) with their own dead bodies. In this hurly-burly and di|&s;tre&s;s the Spaniards, whither by force or other|wi&s;e, procured <HI>Motezuma</HI> (who was yet in their power) to appear above upon a Gallerie, or flat of roof the hou&s;e, upon a pretence, that he &s;hould offer &s;om terms of accomodation from the Spaniards, and to &s;hew him&s;elf to be well: But it was in a place where the &s;tones and ar|rows flew &s;o thick from the enraged multitude below, that <HI>Motezuma</HI> him&s;elf received a

However it were, not long after his death, out of extream nece&s;&s;ity, and chiefly for want of Victuals, the Spaniards were forced to leave the City in the night time, and with the lo&s;s of four hundred and fifty of their men, who were &s;lain or taken pri&s;o|ners at the pa&s;&s;ing of a draw-Bridge; the re&s;t making a heavy retreat to their friends at <HI>Tla&s;|calla.</HI> There is &s;tanding at this day in <HI>Mexico,</HI> upon the place where &s;o many of them were killed, a certain Hermitage, which they call <HI>Los Martyres,</HI> or the Hermitage of the Mar|tyrs; but <HI>very improperly,</HI> &s;aith mine Author, their own Countriman: for what rea&s;on I &s;hall not here enquire.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>PEru,</HI> in the Southern part of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> was anciently a great and mighty Kingdome, as <HI>Mexico</HI> in the Northern, and fell under the power of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> much after the &s;ame manner, that the King|dome of <HI>Mexico</HI> did, <HI>viz.</HI> through the di&s;&s;en|tions and differences among the People them|&s;elves: The manner and occa&s;ion briefly thus. <HI>Huayna Capac,</HI> the la&s;t <HI>Inca,</HI> or King of <HI>Peru,</HI> had, be&s;ide many others, two Sons which he chiefly loved; the one by a lawfull Wife his neer Kin&s;women, called <HI>Hua&s;car:</HI> the other by a Concubine named <HI>Atabalipa;</HI> betwixt whom, at his death, he divided his Kingdome; &s;etling the one, <HI>viz.

<PB N="391" REF="205">
But <HI>Hua&s;car</HI> re&s;ted not long content, di&s;daining that a Ba&s;tard-Brother &s;hould &s;hare &s;o much with him in his Kingdome, contrary to the more ju&s;t intere&s;t of &s;ome of his other Brothers, and to the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Incas</HI> his Ance&s;tors, who alwaies ruled as Monarchs, not admitting any divi&s;ion of their Kingdoms. Hereupon differences and emulations ari&s;e be|twixt the two Brothers; <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> King of <HI>Quito,</HI> is commanded to appear at <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> both to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Funeral &s;olemnities of <HI>Huayna Capac</HI> their Father, and to doe ho|mage for his Kingdome; which he doth not refu&s;e: only de&s;ireth the King his Brother not to oblige him to come &s;o far, and through Countries &s;o un&s;afe, without an attendance &s;uitable to a King, and that might &s;ecure his journey: which pretence of his was not thought unrea&s;onable. So he brings along with him an Army of thirty thou&s;and men; which, through the negligence and too much &s;ecurity of <HI>Hua&s;cars</HI> Officers of Warre, was permitted to come &s;o neer <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> that with it, after &s;ome Battels fought, he taketh pri&s;oner <HI>Hua&s;car</HI> him&s;elf, King of <HI>Peru,</HI> puts to death all the <HI>Incas,</HI> or Children of the Blood Royal, that he could get into his power; and in this manner, for &s;ome time, holds the Kingdom,

though not without much difficulty, by rea&s;on of the hatred which the people generally bare towards him, for his cruelty towards the Roy|all Progenie; and the oppo&s;ition which divers of <HI>Hua&s;cars</HI> Captains made again&s;t him in &s;e|veral parts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Things being in this condition at <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> among the Natives, the Spaniards that were at <HI>Panama,</HI> having re&s;ted there full fifteen yeers &s;ince the Conque&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> without ma|king any further di&s;covery upon the South Sea than the <HI>I&s;lands of Pearls,</HI> which lye not above &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen leagues off from <HI>Panama,</HI> re&s;olve, about this time, to make &s;ome further &s;earch of the Continent by Sea.

found him&s;elf only with fourteen Men in a poor I&s;land, and in the mo&s;t de&s;titute conditi|on that could be. Yet being him&s;elf of an un|daunted courage and re&s;olution, and tho&s;e few men he had with him of the &s;ame minde with him&s;elf, they all re&s;olved rather to dye than to give over the De&s;ign. So putting again to Sea, they fall at la&s;t into the River of <HI>Tum|bez,</HI> which in a few dayes brings them to a town and fortified place called likewi&s;e <HI>Tum|bez</HI> where they found Inhabitants and a place mo&s;t agreeable to their de&s;ires, <HI>viz.</HI> where they found good plenty of Gold; for which, not being in a condition to fight, they were content at pre&s;ent to &s;eem Merchants; and &s;o for a few petty Commodities which they had brought with them, of no value, 'tis &s;aid they received of the Natives the full quantity of thirty thou&s;and <HI>pezos</HI> of pure gold; which re|vived their &s;pirits not a little. Whereupon finding the Countrie to be good and likely to afford much Trea&s;ure, they return back again to <HI>Panama,</HI> make declaration of the Coun|trie they had di&s;covered, and &s;ollicite for fur|ther licen&s;e to &s;ubdue and conquer it.

The Spaniards at fir&s;t treated him well, and put him in &s;uch hopes of liberty, that out of con|fidence to gain it, and that he might enjoy the Kingdome, though tributary to the Spaniards, him&s;elf alone, he cau&s;ed his Brother the King <HI>Hua&s;car</HI> to be put &s;ecretly to death, and di&s;|&s;embled the matter to the Spaniards, as if it had been done again&s;t his will; which, they in|tending other matters, did not much examine. To obtain his liberty, he offered the Spaniards to give them the room wherein they were, filled up with gold and &s;ilver as high as a Souldier

could reach with the point of his &s;word; and, as &s;ome &s;ay, performed it, at lea&s;t the greater part of it: Yet were the Spaniards &s;o farre from granting him liberty, according to his expectation and their promi&s;e, that not long after they took away his life, mo&s;t ba&s;ely &s;trangling him in pri&s;on, after they had received him, as 'tis credibly reported, above ten milli|ons of gold and &s;ilver together: upon preten|ces indeed of Trea&s;on, and &s;ome dangerous plottings again&s;t them, by <HI>Atabalipa</HI> and his People; (a criminal piece of Trea&s;on doubt|le&s;s, for a poor Prince, injuriou&s;ly impri&s;oned, to endeavour his liberty, and his &s;ubjects to a&s;&s;i&s;t him the be&s;t they could!)

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Province of <HI>Chile.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. FOllowing the coa&s;t of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> or the South Sea, the next Province pertaining formerly to the Kingdome of <HI>Peru,</HI> is that of <HI>Chile.</HI> This is the mo&s;t Southerly Province of the whole Country of <HI>America,</HI> reaching up as far as <HI>Magallanes</HI> Streits, with which to the Southward it is bounded: North|ward it hath a De&s;art, and undi&s;covered Country, lying betwixt it and the confines of <HI>Peru</HI> called <HI>Atacama:</HI> on the We&s;t it hath <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI> and on the Ea&s;t up to <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> the Atlantick or North Sea, with &s;ome Countries undi&s;covered, which inter|po&s;e betwixt it and <HI>Paraguay</HI> to the North-Ea&s;t. It lyeth all of it beyond the Tropique of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> in a temperate Zone, and extendeth it &s;elf in length from the borders of <HI>Peru,</HI> to the mouth of the Streits five hundred leagues or more; but the breadth of it neither equall nor certain. They &s;ay 'tis called <HI>Chile</HI> from the word <HI>Chil,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>cold;</HI> it &s;eems
<PB N="423" REF="221">
in their language as well as ours, it being ge|nerally a cold and bleak Country, the aire in many parts of it &s;o extremely &s;harp and pier|cing, that both Hor&s;e and Rider &s;ometimes in travelling are frozen to death, as the Spani|ards found by experience in their fir&s;t &s;earch and di&s;covery of the Country, under the Con|duct of <HI>Diego Almagro,</HI> who is &s;aid to have left the greate&s;t part of his men dead behinde him in this manner. But this is chiefly towards the <HI>Andes,</HI> and on the Sea coa&s;t; the more inland parts of it, though mountainous al&s;o in &s;ome parts, yet are more temperate, and being al&s;o well watered with Rivers, are much more fruitfull than the other, affording both Wheat, and <HI>Maiz,</HI> and likewi&s;e other grain, excel|lent Pa&s;turage in many places and great &s;tore of Cattel, Wine, Honey, not without many &amp; rich Mines both of Gold and Silver. The Na|tives of this Country were found the mo&s;t &s;tout and warlike of all the Americans, the Spaniards had hitherto met withall, fighting with them and oftentimes defeating them in the open field &s;urpri&s;ing and &s;acking their Towns, and la&s;t of all taking their Captain and Commander in chief Pri&s;oner. This was <HI>Pedro Baldivia,</HI> one of tho&s;e good men that con&s;ented to the death of <HI>Atabalipa</HI> the la&s;t
<PB N="424" REF="222">
King of <HI>Peru,</HI> after a greater ran&s;ome ac|cepted and paid, than perhaps the King of <HI>Spain</HI> could well rai&s;e on a &s;udden, if he had occa&s;ion to u&s;e it for him&s;elf. The <HI>Araucans</HI> (for &s;o are the People called that had him pri|&s;oner) are &s;aid to have entertained him for a while gallantly, making him a fea&s;t; but for his la&s;t draught give him a cup of melted gold, which the poor man was forced to take down, and &s;o dyed.</P>
<P>The whole Province generally is divided fir&s;t into <HI>Chile,</HI> &s;pecially &s;o called; and &s;econd|ly <HI>Magellanica,</HI> or that part which lyeth more Southward down to the Streits of <HI>Ma|gellan.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Chile,</HI> properly &s;o called, is bordered Northward with the De&s;art and barren Countrie of <HI>Atacama</HI> above mentioned; on the South with <HI>Magellanica;</HI> on the We&s;t with <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> Ea&s;tward and to the North-Ea&s;t with &s;ome parts of <HI>Pa|raguay,</HI> or rather with &s;ome undi&s;co|vered Countries, lying betwixt them both. The length of it from North to South is recko|ned to be little le&s;s than three hundred leagues, and generally of a fruitfull Soile, affording be&s;ide aboundance of gold and &s;ilver, both Corn, Cattel, Vineyards, and divers &s;orts of
<PB N="425" REF="222">
Fruits, equall both for kinde and plenty to <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf, and &s;undry other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Aire likewi&s;e for the mo&s;t part temperate, and the People, in their manners and conditi|ons approaching much neerer to the Civility and likewi&s;e &s;ubtilty of Europeans, than other Americans did: which doubtle&s;s may be at|tributed to the conformity of the Climates under which they lye, agreeable to tho&s;e of <HI>Europe;</HI> though otherwi&s;e in re&s;pect of the &s;phere and &s;ea&s;ons of the yeer, there be Diame|tricall difference betwixt us, as for example, their Spring beginning in <HI>September,</HI> which is our Autumn; and their Autumn in <HI>March,</HI> which is our Spring: their longe&s;t day being that of <HI>St. Lucy</HI> on the eleventh of <HI>December,</HI> which is our &s;horte&s;t; and their &s;horte&s;t be|ing <HI>St. Barnabies, viz.</HI> the eleventh of <HI>June</HI> which is our longe&s;t, &amp;c.</P>

So that very little can be &s;aid more of this Countrie, than only to name the Ports and places upon the Sea coa&s;ts, at which the Spaniards, and likewi&s;e &s;ome other Nati|ons at &s;everal times have touched: the chief whereof upon the South-Sea are fir&s;t <HI>Cabo de las I&s;las,</HI> a Promontorie or Foreland twenty &s;ix leagues di&s;tant from that of <HI>St. Felix</HI> on the confines of <HI>Chile.</HI> 2. <HI>Puerto de San.
