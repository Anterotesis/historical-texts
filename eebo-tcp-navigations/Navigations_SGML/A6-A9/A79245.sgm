<P>VVE have and &s;hall endeavour to give &s;atisfaction to the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> in the grounds of our pre&s;ent proceedings. But we thinke fit notwith&s;tanding, to make a particular addre&s;&s;e to you, being extreamly de&s;irous that the City of <HI>London</HI>

<HEAD>A Declaration of the proceedings of a party for the King within the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the re&s;olution of the Army touching the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THE great in&s;olency of the Royal party with|in and about the City of London, occa&s;ions much jealou&s;ie from the Army; the hatred and malice of the Royali&s;ts being &s;o great, that it over &s;wayes their di&s;cretion &s;o much, that they cannot keep them&s;elves within the bounds of ordinary civi|lity, and di&s;cover them&s;elves by &s;eeking their private revenge; as appears by their late horrid action execu|ted upon certain Members of the Army neer the Strand, who by &s;ome of the bloudy Con&s;pirators were mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly murthered in their Beds. This inhumane De&s;ign &s;trikes terrour to the well-affected party, who being much perplexed thereat, acquaints the Army therewith; in&s;omuch that &s;ome of the com|manders forthwith &s;ends a letter to the City, the effect whereof followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>We are much startled at the in&s;olency of the trayte|rous &s;laves in</HI> London, <HI>to kill two Officers of our Army, one in his bed, and the other with a cowardly &s;tab, and of their intended attempt to pi&s;toll our Generall, be&s;ides many a&s;saults upon Members of Parliament, and their De&s;ign to have ma&s;sacred four&s;core of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We do prote&s;t, if the Royall &s;laves continue their in&s;o|lency, and put uny of the&s;e De&s;igns into execution, we will for every mans life take one hundred of their owr party, and according to the quality of each ma&s;&s;acred per&s;on, and will hang up their heads on &s;pires of steeples, that the world may &s;ee the ju&s;t judgment of God upon the&s;e Rebels and Traytors, which his Maie&s;ty confe&s;ses are
<PB N="5" REF="4">guilty of all the innocent bloud of the four bundred thou|&s;and &s;oules that have peri&s;hed in this War.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Letter was thought fit to be publi&s;hed to the view of all per&s;ons what&s;oever, whereby all whom it may concern, may take notice of the &s;en&s;e and re&s;olu|tion of the Army, and their reall and candid De&s;ires to prevent the effu&s;ion of bloud for the future.</P>
<P>And do further declare, That they look upon the ci|ty of <HI>London,</HI> with a tender eye and affection, being re|&s;olved to ingage both life and fortunes, for the defence and pre&s;ervation thereof, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>Further declaring&punc; That it is the re&s;olution and de|&s;ire of the army, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours for the &s;upporting all tho&s;e who have adhered to them, e|ven in the great and perilous times of War, and to act upon &s;uch principles, that may tend to the publique &s;afety of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>ON Tue&s;day <HI>Octob.</HI> 3. By an Expre&s;&s;e from <HI>Scot|land</HI> it was advertized, That the Royali&s;ts of <HI>Eng|land</HI> have been very active in the Kingdom of <HI>Den|mark;</HI> for the arming of a party again&s;t this King|dom, and after &s;ome con&s;ultation touching the pre&s;ent affairs of this Nation, 10000 Arms were de&s;igned for them by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and &s;hipping appointed to tran|&s;port t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">em into <HI>Scotland,</HI> who accordingly arrived in Lieth Road, thinking to joyn with the Scots Royali&s;ts, but being di&s;covered by the Marq. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> a party were commanded out in &s;everall long Boats, and &s;mal Ve&s;&s;els, who &s;oon boarded the Dani&s;h &s;hips, &s;eized on all the Ordnance, arms and ammunition, and &s;ecured the &s;hips in the Harbour.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P><HI>A bloudy Fight at Sea.</HI></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day la&s;t, we received intelligence from <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> That there hath hapned a bloudy Fight neer <HI>Rye,</HI> an Engli&s;h Haven town, and garri&s;on'd by the Par|liament, the manner thus. Major <HI>Gibbon</HI> (the Gover|nour) being allarm'd from an Iri&s;h-man of War, who had cha&s;ed three &s;hips belonging to the &s;aid Garri&s;on, immediatly man'd &s;everall long Boats with musketiers and made towards him, and after a bloudy and &s;harp di&s;pute, re&s;cued the <HI>Rye</HI> &s;hips, and killed nine of the Re|bels, with the lo&s;&s;e of two men</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day <HI>Octob.</HI> 4. Both Hou&s;es debated His Maj. Letter, and voted, That the &s;aid Letter is un&s;ati&s;|factory, declaring, That they will proceed according to the Propo&s;itions, and none other. His Maje&s;ty re-a&s;|&s;umed the Treaty on <HI>Munday,</HI> but its hoped that He will concur in matter and form to what the Parlia|ment de&s;ire.</P>
