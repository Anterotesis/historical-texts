</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>_I</HI> Heare great meruailes of ye (Sir) an|&s;wered <HI>Primaleon,</HI> and truly I would gladly &s;&eacute;e a mon&s;ter &s;o admirable. Ne|uer de&s;ire the &s;ight of him, replied <HI>Pa|lantine,</HI> for in &s;ooth yee were better &s;&eacute;e the Diuell, than <HI>Patagon.</HI> I pray yee Sir (quoth <HI>Primaleon</HI>) let vs go hunt that way where he abideth, and &s;o we may chance to get a &s;ight of him: but we will put on our armour, to preuent the wor&s;t which may happen. Ile beare ye companie an|&s;wered <HI>Palantine,</HI> albe it I haue no de&s;ire to &s;&eacute;e him. At which words <HI>Primaleon</HI> &s;miled, and arming them&s;elues pre&s;ently, toward the mountaines they ride, with twen|tie other good Knights in their traine. So long they cha|&s;ed on euerie &s;ide, that at length darke night ouer-tooke them, euen as they rode along a plaine field, where <HI>Pri|malcon</HI> intreating them to abide till next morning: they y&eacute;elded theretoo, and euerie one tooke his re&s;t, except <HI>Pri|maleon,</HI> who was de&s;irous to make him&s;elfe there &s;poken of by &s;ome action of honour, worthie note and fame: and doubting lea&s;t <HI>Palantine</HI> would not guide him directly
<PB REF="8">to m&eacute;ete with <HI>Patagon,</HI> beholding likewi&s;e howe euerie one &s;lept, &s;oftly hee aro&s;e, and taking no body with him but his Squire <HI>Purente,</HI> &s;traied &s;o farre from them in the nights &s;ea&s;on, as when morning appeared, he found him in the mid&s;t of a faire &s;pacious wood.</P>
<P>At length he e&s;pied <HI>Patagon,</HI> who had hunted therea|bout, and was now giuing his Lyons their f&eacute;es, at which &s;ight <HI>Primaleon</HI> greatly reioyced. <HI>Patagon</HI> &s;&eacute;eing him, thinking pre&s;ently this was a pray prouided for him, im|mediatly let &s;lip his Lyons, &amp; hartned them on again&s;t the Knight: who being mounted on the hor&s;e that <HI>Gata|ru</HI> gaue him, &amp; &s;&eacute;eing the Lyons come &s;o furiou&s;ly again&s;t him, leapt lightly from his hor&s;e, when the Lyons (not re|garding him) &s;et both vppon the hor&s;e very gr&eacute;edily. <HI>Pa|tagon</HI> cro&s;&s;ing an arrowe in his bow, let it fly at y^e Knight, but his Armour b&eacute;eing of good proofe, it did not hurt him, and he making toward him, gaue him &s;uch a thru&s;t with his Launce, as it pierced quite through both his legges. <HI>Patagon</HI> f&eacute;eling him&s;elfe wounded, &s;natched foorth the Launce againe, and darted it at the Knight, who e&s;pied it comming, and therefore quickly &s;tept a&s;ide, &s;etting hand to his &s;word to draw it foorth: but <HI>Patagon</HI> hauing a great Courtlar, &s;mote &s;o &s;trongly therewith vppon the Knights Sh&eacute;eld, that he cleft it in two parts, for which he was requited with two &s;uch &s;ound &s;trokes, as <HI>Patagon</HI> imagined him&s;elfe more than halfe dead already. Wher|fore, ca&s;ting both his bow and Courtlax on the ground, &amp; forgetting to cal for helpe with his Cornet, he ran to get feyzment on his enemies body, thinking to &s;trangle him betw&eacute;ene his armes: but he &s;uddenly gaue backe, &amp; wat|ched him &s;uch a blow with his &s;worde on the right arme, that he pared away mo&s;t part of the fle&s;h, cutting off his hand likewi&s;e, which fell downe to the ground. Nowe through the grieuous paine he felt by his wounds, as al&s;o his lo&s;&s;e of blood, which dyed the gra&s;&s;e round about him, he was no longer able to &s;tand on his legs, but falling on
<PB REF="9">the earth, roared &s;o dreadfully, as it would haue terre&s;ied the very &s;teute&s;t hart in the world to heare him. At this noy&s;e, the Lyens for&s;ooke the hor&s;e, running toward the Knight with woonderful fury: new it &s;tood him on to bee hardy and valiant, for the Lyons rent his armor in diuers places, giuing him (withall) foure or fiue great wounds: but he thru&s;t his &s;woord through y^e ones belly, which made him &s;tretch him&s;elfe along on the ground dead, and tur|ning backe on the other, cleft his head in two pieces with his weapon thus was he rid of the Lyons both together. Nor was he vnmindfull to thanke God for this good &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e, neither did his owne hurtes any way di&s;may him, but leauing the Lyons, he came to the <HI>Graund Patagon,</HI> beeing de&s;irous (&s;&eacute;eing him &s;o &s;trangely &s;hapen) to take him thence with him as his pri&s;oner, thinking it would be a great honour, to haue him embarqued, and make a pre&s;ent of him to Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Grydonia.</HI></P>
<P>Then calling <HI>Purente</HI> to him, who was greatly a&s;toni|ed at this mi&s;&s;hapen &s;ight, &amp; reioyced that his ma&s;ter had e&s;caped &s;uch danger: Ly&s;t a while, quoth <HI>Primaleon,</HI> and let vs deui&s;e, how we may get hence this infernall furie, that my mi&s;tre&s;&s;e <HI>Grydonia</HI> might haue a &s;ight of him. I know not, &s;aid <HI>Porente,</HI> how it can po&s;&s;ibly be done, be|cau&s;e he is &s;o &s;ore wounded: neuerthele&s;&s;e, we wil try all likely meanes to accompli&s;h your de&s;ire.</P>
<P>So taking the chaine, wherewith he v&s;ed to lea&s;he his Lyons togither, they fa&s;&s;ned it about his neck, whereat he gaue &s;uch another loude &s;hrieke, as called two other of his &s;auage <HI>Patagons,</HI> with long &s;harpe pointed yrons in their hands: which (notwith&s;tanding) were likewi&s;e van|qui&s;hed by <HI>Primaleon,</HI> though ind&eacute;ed with much a doo, in regard he was &s;o dangerou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P>Hauing breathed and re&s;ted him&s;elfe there awhile, he concluded to depart thence; but he could not deui&s;e how to get <HI>Patagon</HI> along with him, neither how to help him|&s;elfe, becau&s;e the Lyons had torne his hor&s;e in pieces.</P>
<PB REF="9">
<P>Being in this perplexity, it fortuned that <HI>Torques, Palentine,</HI> and all the other whom he left a &s;l&eacute;epe, arriued where hee was: but when they beheld what <HI>Prim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">leon</HI> had done, they &s;tood amazed thereat, and <HI>Torques</HI> aligh|ting from his hor&s;e, came to <HI>Primaleon</HI> in this manner. Beleeue me my Lord (quoth he) I may iu&s;tly complaine of your vnkindne&s;&s;e, in for&s;aking me as yee did all the&s;e other: albeit I am of &s;o &s;lender valour, as my helpe will &s;tand yee but in little &s;ted, yet might I in &s;eruice haue at|tended on ye, to doo what&s;oeuer liked you to commaund me: Say good my Lord, how ch&eacute;ere ye? for me thinkes your hurts are very offen&s;iue.</P>
<P>I thanke God &s;aid <HI>Primaleon,</HI> I find my &s;elfe very wel now I haue broght this earne&s;t de&s;ired enterpri&s;e to end. <HI>Palentine,</HI> and al the re&s;t of his company &s;o admired this rare accident, as they knew not which way to extol it &s;uf|ficiently.</P>
<P>Sir Knight, &s;aid <HI>Palantine,</HI> God hath highly fauoured ye, in that you alone haue effected, what this whole I&s;land could not doo: now hath <HI>Patagon</HI> his de&s;erts, for &s;hould he haue continued longer in the&s;e parts, we mu&s;t haue b&eacute;ene enforced to flie our countrey, as vnable to endure his diueli&s;h cruelty.</P>
<P>Well (quoth <HI>Primaleon</HI>) he &s;hal now trouble ye no lon|ger, therefore helpe to lead him along with vs, that they which before feared him, may now at their plea&s;ure be|hold him. Sixe of them pricked him forward with their Launces, and <HI>Torques</HI> tooke the Cornet from about his necke, &s;etting it to his mouth, for triall of the &s;ound, and whether any more <HI>Patagons</HI> would come thither or no: but had there not b&eacute;ene &s;o many in company, he might full well haue repented his folly, for fift&eacute;ene more came run|ning foorth of the woods vppon them, which in the ende were euery one foyled, <HI>Palentine, Torques</HI> and all the o|ther Knights &s;hewing great valour, and were not a little proud of &s;o great a victory.</P>
<PB REF="10">
<P>All the <HI>Patagons</HI> being di&s;patchy, they holp one another to dre&s;&s;e their hurts, for not one of them e&s;caped vnwoun|ded: two Knights of <HI>Ormeda</HI> gaue their hor&s;es to <HI>Prima|leon</HI> and <HI>Torques,</HI> rather chu&s;ing them&s;elues to trauaile on foote, than &s;uffer men of &s;o great de&s;ert to bee &s;o vnpro|uided. All the way as they rode, &s;uch wunderment was made at the <HI>Graund Patagon,</HI> as euery one enquired, to knowe their deliuerer from &s;o hideous a mon&s;ter: &amp; when <HI>Primaleon</HI> was &s;hewen the~, imagin you, what triumphs and honours they be&s;towed therefore vppon him. The Lord of the I&s;land, (to whom <HI>Primaleon</HI> thus farre had di&s;clo&s;ed him&s;elfe, that hee was called the Knight of the clouen Rocke) embracing him for this great good for|tune, &s;aid. Pardon me Sir, if I haue not hitherto hono|red yee to your high de&s;eruings, and let my ignorance of your vertues, excu&s;e &s;o great an ouer&s;ight. Immediatly he commanded his Chirurgions to haue e&s;peciall care of his wounds, as al&s;o tho&s;e which the <HI>Graund Patagon</HI> had re|ceiued, becau&s;e <HI>Primaleon</HI> was &s;o de&s;irous to k&eacute;epe him aliue: but he would not &s;uffer them apply any medicines to his hurtes, wi&s;hing rather to die than bee recouered. <HI>Seluida</HI> (for &s;o was the Lords daughter of the I&s;land na|med) came in great feare to &s;&eacute;e <HI>Patagon:</HI> mary hee was well plea&s;ed in beholding her, and &s;hewed him&s;elfe not &s;o rough and impacient, as before he did, participating with the bea&s;ts nature of whom he was engendred, who only delighted in womens company.</P>
<P>When they perceiued his gentlenes in the Ladies &s;ight and how obediently he behaued him&s;elfe to her, her doubt and feare of him being well remooued: they per&s;waded her to come the oftner in his &s;ight, and &s;hee &s;o preuailed with him by faire demeanour, that &s;hee could gouerne him as &s;he plea&s;ed, intreating him (by &s;ignes) to permit his hurts be cured: but he declared by his &s;ignes, how he had n&eacute;ede of no other Chirurgion than him&s;elfe, and licking his wounds, with his huge broad tongue, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">aue &s;hew, that this
<PB REF="10">was Phi&s;icke &s;ufficient for him.

<P>Now <HI>Palantine</HI> imagined, if any meane might pre|uaile for his abiding there, it was to giue him his Si&s;ter in marriage, which deui&s;e he imparted to his Father, and he (on the other &s;ide) no le&s;&s;e willing thereto than his &s;on, &s;ent him to acquaint <HI>Primaleon</HI> therewith, &s;o comming into his chamber, &amp; &s;itting downe by him on the beds &s;ide, he began as followeth. Sir Knight of the clouen Rocke, my father and we all doo loue ye &s;o dearely, as wee are ve|rie loath to forgoe your companie, wherefore he giues you to vnder&s;ta~d by me, that if you plea&s;e to accept my Si&s;ter <HI>Seluida</HI> in marriage, her dowrie &s;hall an&s;were your own expectation, &amp; he will repute him&s;elfe happie by enioying &s;uch a &s;onne.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Palantine</HI> (an&s;wered <HI>Primaleon</HI>) I thanke both him and you for the great loue ye beare me, <HI>Seluida</HI> is &s;o faire and vertuous, as I would account my &s;elf fortunate hauing her my wife, if there were not an e&s;peciall hinde|rance in this ca&s;e: then let me plainely tell yee, my hart is els where countermaunded, and in heauens faire fore|head are my vowes engrauen, which makes mee thinke my &s;tay here is ouer tedions, though I could as willingly die, as part from your companie, but that yee perceaue what an vrgent occa&s;ion thereto con&s;traineth me.</P>
<P>If it be &s;o (quoth <HI>Palantine</HI>) then I vow to trauaile a long with you, and neuer to returne hither againe, while you haue any &s;eruice wherein to imploy me.</P>

<P>He accepted his kinde offer, and &s;o he went to aduer|ti&s;e his father thereof who albeit he was loth to forgo his &s;onne, yet for the company of &s;o good a Knight, he di&s;pen|&s;ed with fatherly affection, agr&eacute;eing to his &s;ons commen|dable re&s;olution.</P>
<P><HI>Primaleon</HI> was no &s;ooner cured, but proui&s;ion for depar|ture as &s;p&eacute;edily appointed, to the Ladies no little griefe, who had good hope, that better acception would haue been made of her loue, for (ind&eacute;ed) &s;hee affected <HI>Primaleon</HI> en|tirely. Thus by the meanes of her, was <HI>Patagon</HI> embar|qued, wher taking a heauy farewel of her vain-be&s;towed loue, the teares &s;tanding like pearles on her faire ch&eacute;ekes, &s;he thus &s;pake. Sir Knight of the clouen Rocke, much better had it b&eacute;ene (for me) neuer to haue &s;eene ye, for ye take from me my brother <HI>Palantine,</HI> leauing my poore heart fettered in &s;tronger chaines, than tho&s;e wherein <HI>Pa|tagon</HI> is manacled: but would that mine were compara|ble to his, then were I a&s;&s;ured to go along in your compa|ny with the&s;e words &s;he went on &s;hoare againe, not ha|uing the patience to heare his an&s;were, which mouing co~|pa&s;&s;ion in him, made him thus &s;hape his &s;p&eacute;ech to <HI>Palan|tine.</HI> I am partly &s;ory, that I cannot doe your &s;i&s;ter &s;uch &s;eruice as I would, and de&s;ertle&s;&s;e (on my behalfe) is the loue &s;hee beares me: but what I cannot accompli&s;h for her, &s;hall binde me in a &s;tricter bond to you, reckoning you alwaies as my d&eacute;ere friend and brother. Now was <HI>Patagon</HI> euermore affraid when he looked on <HI>Primaleon,</HI> for he knew him to be the Knight that vanqui&s;hed him: therefore when he menaced him, he pre&s;ently was hum|ble, and at his commandement, &s;tanding more in feare of him, than any other in the company.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Knight that would not &s;tay the deliuerance of <HI>Primaleon,</HI> when he was enchanted in the I&s;le of <HI>Cantara,</HI> returned home into <HI>Poland,</HI> where he re|ported the Knight of the clouen Rocks death: the great mone <HI>Gridonia</HI> made for him, and what was &s;trangely tolde her, by the Knight of the enclo&s;ed I&s;le.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THus &s;ailes <HI>Primaleon</HI> toward <HI>Polonia,</HI> with all the &s;p&eacute;ed po&s;&s;ible, earne&s;tly de|&s;iring to &s;&eacute;e his <HI>Grydonia,</HI> fearing lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould heare &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter tidings of him, and thereby change her minde, to like of &s;ome other Knight: which doubt in him was altogither n&eacute;edle&s;&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he could like nor loue any other but he.</P>
<P>Now (as ye haue heard beforeone) Knight (of the com|pany) would n&eacute;eds be gon from the I&s;land of <HI>Cantara</HI> not willing to &s;tay the deliuerance of <HI>Primaleon,</HI> becau&s;e he bare him no good affection: this Knight is now come home into <HI>Poland,</HI> where being in pre&s;ence of Qu&eacute;ene mother and <HI>Grydonia,</HI> he declared what had hauned them, and &s;aid that the Knight of the clouen Rocke was dead: the&s;e newes brought <HI>Grydoma</HI> to &s;uch extremity of gr&eacute;efe, that leaning in the lap of Qu&eacute;ene mother, &amp; breathing foorth a &s;igh, able to rent a farre &s;tronger hart in p&eacute;eces, &s;he &s;ayd.</P>
<PB REF="12" MS="y">
<P>Vnhappie wretch that I am, let mee nowe die a mo&s;t de&s;perate death, &s;&eacute;eing I haue ouerthrowne the only faire flowre of chiualrie: The&s;e wordes &s;he vttered with &s;uch intire feeling pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he fel into a &s;woun for a pretty whiles &s;pace: when Qu&eacute;ene mother beholding her in this dangerous e&s;tate, and fearing her life to bee now on the late&s;t period of expectation, clapping her on the ch&eacute;eke, thus &s;aid.</P>
<P>Alas &s;w&eacute;et Daughter, what &s;hall I doo with th&eacute;e? I lookt for vengeance on that traitour <HI>Primaleon,</HI> and &s;hall I now &s;&eacute;e th&eacute;e die, in whome my comfort thereof con&s;i|&s;ted? Ah mi&s;erable mother Qu&eacute;ene, much better were my death, than to &s;&eacute;e my faire hope in this extreamitie: Then turning to the Knight, who had deliuered this fal&s;e me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Away (quoth &s;he) with this blacke tel-tale of &s;ad mi&s;|fortune, for I cannot but thinke him a me&s;&s;enger of lies, becau&s;e if the Knight of the Clouen Rocke were dead, as thou laboure&s;t &s;o to per&s;wade vs: all the other that went with him, would haue returned as well as thou.</P>
<P>Rather tell me (fal&s;e traitour) where ha&s;t thou left him? betraied by &s;ome trecherie deui&s;ed in thy di&s;loyal hart, ra|ther than otherwi&s;e; els can no one in the worlde per|&s;wade me, that the famous Knight of the clouen Rocke is dead. After &s;he had thus &s;poken, &s;he caught her Daughter to her againe in her Armes, and by ca&s;ting cold water on her face, chafing her temples, and other &s;uch like meanes, &s;he recouered her former &s;pirits, when looking about her, and &s;eeing euerie eye wet with pittie in con&s;ideration of her ca&s;e, &s;he thus began to complaine.</P>
<P>Faire Knight of the clouen Rocke, is it certaine that thou art dead? I cannot thinke the au&s;pitious heauens &s;o much enuy my good fortune, neither had they &s;o &s;lender regard of th&eacute;e offering thy life to &s;o many dangers for my &s;ake. Be well a&s;&s;ured, that &s;o &s;oone as I am more certaine of thy death, my &s;oule, which only depended vppon thine,
<PB REF="12" MS="y">will quickly k&eacute;epe th&eacute;e companie, to the end it may enicy the plea&s;ure and repo&s;e in another World, which in thys life it was &s;o vngently debard of: there &s;halt thou perceiue the vnfained loue I beare th&eacute;e: for I might be reputed as mon&s;trous ingratefull, if I would make anie &s;pare of my life, &s;&eacute;eing thou wa&s;t depriued of thine, for my loues &s;ake. Since fir&s;t thou had&s;t knowledge of me, nothing fell to thy &s;hare but paine and trauaile, hazarding &s;till thy per|&s;on for defence of mine: now, let not me burie thy kind|ne&s;&s;e in obliuion, but by conuer&s;ing with th&eacute;e familiarly in death, make knowen the true &s;ympathie of my affecti|ons with thine. Peraduenture it may be, that I was vn|worthie to enioy th&eacute;e as myhu&s;band, and therefore Hea|uen thought it m&eacute;ete to cut th&eacute;e off &s;o &s;oone, onely to fore|&s;tall me of &s;o high a happines, and that <HI>Primaleon</HI> might liue in better a&s;&s;urance, than hee did while thou liued&s;t: for none in the world was more likely to take downe his pre&s;uming thoughts, than thou, nor anie able to fini&s;h my &s;olemne vow, but onely thou. The&s;e and a number &s;uch like lamentations &s;he vttered, &s;wouning manie times whereby Qu&eacute;ene Mother greatly de&s;paired of her life, when weeping ouer her, &s;he thus &s;pake.</P>
<P>Alas Daughter, why &s;&eacute;eke&s;t thou to kill me with this griefe of thine? Had I knowen what entyre loue thou did&s;t beare the knight, I would haue giuen better &s;cope to it, than hether too I haue done. Bel&eacute;eue not (I pray th&eacute;e) that hee is dead, becau&s;e the reporter of the&s;e newes is a lyer and a traitor, as euermore all his kindred haue b&eacute;en: let vs &s;end for the other which came home with him, to the end we may perfectly know the certain truth of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>Send for them (quoth <HI>Gridonia</HI>) and let vs heare what they &s;ay, for if the Knight of the clouen Rocke be dead in|d&eacute;ed, make no que&s;tion, but I &s;hall &s;p&eacute;edely follow him. After the other people of the &s;hippe were brought before them, &s;he commaunded them to tell the truth, in dooing
<PB REF="13">of, they &s;hold &s;u&s;taine no harme, otherwi&s;e to a&s;&s;ure them|&s;elues of greuous puni&s;hme~t. Hereon they told how al had happened, that <HI>Purente</HI> likewi&s;e &s;aid, there would a Knight arriue there, who &s;hould deliuer him: marie, their Captaine had no will to &s;tay there &s;uch lea&s;ure, but would n&eacute;edes depart thence, leauing all the re&s;t behinde in hope to recouer him.</P>
<P>Traitour, &s;aid Qu&eacute;ene mother, I knew my conceit of th&eacute;e would not prooue fal&s;e, fayre daughter, leaue to tor|ment your &s;elfe with the&s;e tormenting pa&s;&s;ions, your good Knight will return with &s;p&eacute;ed I warrant ye, and all this gr&eacute;efe &s;halbe conuerted into mirth and ioui&s;ance. After|ward, the lying Knight was commaunded to pri&s;on, the re&s;t were &s;et fr&eacute;e and recompenced, becau&s;e they had told the truth; being not faultie in returning backe to <HI>Poland,</HI> in regard their Captaine enforced them theretoo.</P>
<P>The&s;e tidings were not &s;o di&s;ple&s;ing to both the Qu&eacute;ens onely, but the Infant <HI>Zerphira</HI> tooke them as heauily, yet not daring to expre&s;&s;e her gr&eacute;efe outwardly, &s;he conferred with her priuate thoughts, alleadging her mi&s;fortune to be cau&s;e of the worthie Knights death. But being a La|die both wi&s;e and vertuous, &s;hee concealed her &s;orrowes verie di&s;cr&eacute;etly, v&s;ing manie comfortable per&s;wa&s;ions to <HI>Gridoma,</HI> de&s;iring her not to credite the report of her Knights death, but rather to expect his happie return, and that &s;p&eacute;edely.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter (quoth <HI>Gridonia</HI>) I am &s;o vnfortunate, and e|uermore haue b&eacute;ene &s;ubiect to &s;o manie mi&s;haps, that ra|ther ill is alwaies readie for me, than good, or anie ta&s;te thereof: and I wunder you expre&s;&s;e no more heauines for his death, con&s;idering what reckoning and e&s;t&eacute;eme hee euer made of you.</P>
<P>My gr&eacute;efe (quoth the Infant) would equal yours, were I a&s;&s;ured of his death: but reputing it a fable, I were but vnwi&s;e in n&eacute;edle&s;&s;e hurting of my &s;elfe.</P>
<P>All this day, <HI>Gridonia</HI> continued like one halfe dead,
<PB REF="13">refu&s;ing &s;u&s;tenaunce and companie: at night, throwing her &s;elfe carele&s;ly vpon her bed, Qu&eacute;ene Mother lay down by her, to comfort her: and &s;l&eacute;epe &s;he could not, till extre|mitie of heauines enforced both her theretoo.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were they both a&s;l&eacute;epe, but a &s;trange deform|ed Dwarffe entred the chamber, and taking <HI>Gridonia</HI> by the arme, &s;oftly awaked her: whereat &s;he being amazed, and taking him to be <HI>Ri&s;deno.</HI> &s;he &s;aid. Tell me I pray th&eacute;e, how came&s;t thou hither at this vnfit time? where is thy Lord and mine? for Gods &s;ake tell me, is he aliue or dead? Madam (an&s;wered the dwarffe) I am not <HI>Ri&s;deno,</HI> but one (as de&s;irous as he) to doo ye anie &s;eruice, onely for the Knights &s;ake ye loue &s;o d&eacute;erely, whom you imagine to bee dead, as I gather by your &s;ad and wofull lamentati|ons. I come to a&s;&s;ure ye, that he liues, though (a while) enchaunted, and &s;halbe deliuered by a mo&s;t valiaunt and worthie Knight, who will &s;et him fr&eacute;e, that to reuenge your wrongs, hath made him&s;elfe a pri&s;oner: and of this a&s;&s;uredly per&s;wade your &s;elfe, that you &s;hall &s;&eacute;e him re|returne verie &s;hortly.</P>
<P>Now, in regard ye &s;hould not dye with conceit of gr&eacute;ef, I am expre&s;&s;ely &s;ent hether to tell yee the&s;e glad tidings: for &s;hould not the Knight of the clouen Rocke finde you well at his comming, I know it would be his death im|mediately.</P>
<P>The&s;e newes made <HI>Gridonia</HI> exc&eacute;eding ioyfull, and looking about for the Dwarffe, &s;he beheld a Man of a tall &s;tature, olde and wrinckle-faced, &s;tanding by her, which greatly a&s;toni&s;hed her, &s;aying. What great wunders are the&s;e? My friend, by the reuerendfaith thou beare&s;t to God, I charge th&eacute;e tell me, if the tidings I haut heard be true or no, and what is become of the Dwarffe that &s;pake to me euen now, whome I at the fir&s;t tooke to be <HI>Ri&s;deno</HI> &s;eruant to the Knight of the clouen Rock, who&s;e ab&s;ence thus gr&eacute;eueth me?</P>

<P>My good frend, replyed <HI>Gridonia,</HI> heauen quite ye for this kindnes, how much haue ye ea&s;ed my troubled minde by this glad&s;ome report? But &s;&eacute;eing your &s;kill is &s;uch, I pray ye tell me more, concerning the Knight of the clouen Rocke, &s;ay of what race he is di&s;cended, &s;&eacute;eing you are &s;o well acquainted with him. Faire Qu&eacute;ene, an&s;wered the old man, know that the Knight is of &s;o high linage, &s;uch great valour and e&s;teeme, as he hath not his equall in the world, except <HI>Primalcon</HI> onely, to whom you beare &s;uch deadly hatred: and h&eacute;ere of re&s;olue your &s;elf, no Knight is able to bring ye <HI>Primaleons</HI> head, but this famous Knight of the clouen Rocke, who ind&eacute;ed &s;hall giue it ye, and rai&s;e ye to &s;uch dignitie withall, as you &s;halbe the onely happie Ladie of the world. Loue him therefore with all your hart, for yee haue great rea&s;on to doo &s;o: as for de&s;cribing him more openly to ye, that will I neuer y&eacute;eld to, becau&s;e I &s;hould therein offer him no meane iniurie, in regard he de&s;ires to trauaile thus concealed.</P>
<P>Alas my friend, replied <HI>Gridonia,</HI> in that poynt I ac|count my &s;elfe mo&s;t vnfortunate, becau&s;e I can attaine to no certaintie thereof: and &s;&eacute;eing you refu&s;e therein to &s;a|ti&s;fie me, tell me then the rea&s;on, why he is &s;o loth to haue him&s;elfe knowen. Becau&s;e hee tooke &s;uch an oath (quoth the olde man) when hee left his Countrey; but the tyme will come, when you &s;hal better know him, and then wil you e&s;t&eacute;eme your fortune matchle&s;&s;e, being Ladie of &s;uch a Knight, compleat in all perfections: nor can hee be fel|lowed by anie one, but he that mu&s;t deliuer him from this Enchauntment, who is of no le&s;&s;e vertues than hee, and trauailes (&s;hadowed) in &s;uch manner as he doth. Great friends will both the&s;e Knights be in this voyage, but in time hereafter, their loue &s;halbe conuerted to meruailous
<PB REF="14">hatred, which wil cau&s;e more griefe in you, than euer (as yet) ye endured: neuerthele&s;&s;e, be of good ch&eacute;ere, and di&s;|may not, for all your fortunes &s;hall haue a &s;ucce&s;&s;full con|clu&s;ion.

At the&s;e words, hee put the Ring vpon her finger, wherein was &s;et a mo&s;t fayre Emeralde, which &s;he graciou&s;ly accepted, and while &s;hee looked downe but to behold it, the old Man was vani&s;hed: &s;he perceiuing the Ring to beautifull, and of great value, looking vp againe, to thanke the olde Man for be&s;towing it on her, wundred what was become of him, gr&eacute;euing becau&s;e he had &s;o &s;uddenly left her, yet determined to be of better courage afterward.</P>
<P>This olde Man was the Knight of the Enclo&s;ed I&s;le, who knowing <HI>Gridonia</HI> at the verie point of death, by the fal&s;e newes of the di&s;loyall Knight, tran&s;ported him|&s;elfe thorough the ayre, and came thus to comfort her.
