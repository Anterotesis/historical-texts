<HEAD>The Ea&s;t-India TRADE</HEAD>
<P>BEING lately Propo&s;ed by a Paper in Print to be carryed on by a Stock of 1400000 <HI>l.</HI> to be took up at Intere&s;t on the Credit of it &s;elf, and upon one Months Tax of 70000 <HI>l.</HI> to be &s;ettled for ever to An&s;wer the Intere&s;t of &s;o much of that Money as the Produce of that Trade &s;hould at any time fail to afford, (which without a mighty Misfortune can be none) and the Profit after to Redound to the Landed Men of the Kingdom proportionable to their Re&s;pective Intere&s;t (as more at large by that Paper appears) &s;eeming very hard upon Merchants, and &s;uch as only have Money, and &s;o by that Propo&s;al can come to have no Advantage from that Trade, of the Benefit of which all <HI>England</HI> ought to partake: It &s;eems much more Rea&s;onable it &s;hould be divided between the Owners of Money and Land, which may be done thus.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e as afore&s;aid the Stock for this Trade 1400000 <HI>l.</HI> to be took up at Intere&s;t as need &s;hall require, and the Stock it &s;elf, and one Months Tax of 70000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month for ever to be &s;ettled to &s;ecure it, which Security as afore&s;aid, and a Committee to Manage (as in the Paper propo&s;ed) being &s;ettled, let Books for Sub&s;criptions be opened, and let 700000 <HI>l.</HI> of the 1400000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock be Sub&s;cribed in the very &s;ame way as other Stocks are Sub&s;cribed for, and &s;o to always remain one half of that 1400000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock, with this for Ever Advantage above the other half of it, <HI>viz.</HI> out of the Profits ari&s;ing by the Trade 35000 <HI>l.</HI> which is 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Yearly for the 700000 <HI>l.</HI> Sub&s;cribed, to be always paid in the fir&s;t place to whoever &s;hall be the Owners of the &s;aid 700000 <HI>l.</HI> fir&s;t Sub&s;cribed. And after payment of that Intere&s;t, and the Intere&s;t of &s;uch other Money (if any) as &s;hall more be took up for the U&s;e of the Company, is paid.</P>
<P>The remaining Profits to be divided as upon a Stock of 1400000 <HI>l.</HI> the one Moyety to tho&s;e that Sub&s;cribed the 700000 <HI>l.</HI> and the other Moyety to the Landed Men of the Kingdom, to each according to their Re&s;pective Intere&s;ts. And if no Dividend be made till 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> may be divided, &s;uch Dividend on 1400000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;tock will amount to 420000 <HI>l.</HI> whereof 210000 <HI>l.</HI> will an&s;wer and pay a three Months Tax, after the
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"> Rate of 70000 <HI>l. per</HI> Month, to be paid to the Sheriff, and by the Sheriff to the Hundred, and thence to the Pari&s;h, and there to every Owner of Land, as his Proportion there &s;tands. And the other 210000 <HI>l.</HI> will an&s;wer and pay to every Sub&s;criber 30 al&s;o <HI>per Cent.</HI> for his Mo|ney Sub&s;cribed, in the very &s;ame manner as Dividends in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company have been at any time heretofore made.</P>
<P>And thus this may be &s;ettled betwixt the Merchants, who furni&s;h the Money, and the Landed Men, who lay down no Money, and who for half the Profit of the whole Trade do &s;ecure it.</P>
<P>This way brings in as much fre&s;h Money to carry on the Trade as is now ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">'d of to be Sub&s;cribed in, and will be &s;ecure (pa&s;t all di&s;pute) to whoever Sub&s;cribes it, as far as 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> always, be&s;ides one Moy|ety of all other Profit to be rea&s;onably hoped from the Trade.</P>
<P>This from time to time lets in all &s;uch as will buy them&s;elves in, and removes the Mighty Objection again&s;t the other Propo&s;als, That Mer|chants would be by it left out. And when any other Objection (that &s;eems to have weight) &s;hall further be rai&s;ed, it may be probably an|&s;wered, and by the Propo&s;er of this, who you &s;ee is de&s;irous that &s;ome|thing at lea&s;t for the General Good &s;hould at this time be done in this Thing.</P>
<P>And Gentlemen are de&s;ired to take Notice, That in the late Charters from the Crown to the Company (which is the only now Title they have to in&s;i&s;t on) Power is thereby re&s;erved to Their Maje&s;ties to de|termine tho&s;e Charters at any time before <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1694. if &s;o be that Their Maje&s;ties in their Princely Wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;o plea&s;e to think fit. So that whatever Alterations relating to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, His Maje&s;ty by Act of Parliament or otherwi&s;e, &s;hall plea&s;e to make before <HI>Michael|mas</HI> 1694. may be made before that time without any Inju&s;tice or true colour for Clamour; whereas after that time no Alterations in tho&s;e Charters can be made without ju&s;t Rea&s;on for both for One and Twenty Years forward to come.</P>
