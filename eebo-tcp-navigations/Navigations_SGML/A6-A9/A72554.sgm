<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containes my di&s;couery of diuer&s;e Riuers and Harbours, with their names, and which are fit for Plantations, and which not.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe fir&s;t place I &s;et my foote vpon in <HI>New England,</HI> was the Iles of <HI>Shoulds,</HI> being Ilands in the Sea, about two Leagues from the Mayne.</P>
<P>Vpon the&s;e Ilands, I neither could &s;ee one good timber tree, nor &s;o much good ground as to make a garden.</P>
<P>The place is found to be a good fi&s;hing place for 6. Shippes, but more cannot well be there: for want of convenient &s;tage-roome, as this yeares experience hath proued.</P>
<P>The Harbour is but indifferent good. Vpon the&s;e Ilands are no Savages at all.</P>
<P>The next place I came vnto was <HI>Pannaway,</HI> where one <HI>M. Tom&s;on</HI> hath made a Plantation, there I &s;tayed about one Moneth, in which time, I &s;ent for my men from the Ea&s;t: who came over in diver&s;e Shipps.</P>
<P>At this place I met with the Governour, who came
<PB N="2" REF="6">thither in a Barke which he had from one M. <HI>We&s;ton</HI> a|bout 20. dayes before I arived in the Land.</P>
<P>The Governour then told me, that I was joyned with him in Commi&s;&s;ion as a Coun&s;eller, which be|ing read I fou~d it was &s;o. And he then in the pre&s;ence of three more of the Coun&s;ell, admini&s;tred vnto me an oath.</P>
<P>After the meeting of my men, I went a coa&s;ting in two boats with all my company.</P>
<P>In the time I &s;tayd with <HI>M. Tom&s;on,</HI> I &s;urveyed as much as po&s;&s;ible I could, the wether being vn&s;ea&s;on|able and very much &s;now.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e parts, I &s;aw much good Timber. But the ground it &s;eemed to me not to be good, being very rockey and full of trees and bru&s;hwood.</P>
<P>There is great &s;tore of fowle of diuer&s;e &s;orts, wher|of I fed very plentifully.</P>
<P>About two Engli&s;h miles further to the Ea&s;t, I found a great River and a good harbour called <HI>Pa&s;cattaway.</HI> But for the ground I can &s;ay nothing, but by the rela|tion of the <HI>Sagamore</HI> or King of that place, who told me there was much good ground up in the river about &s;even or eight leagues.</P>
<P>About two leagues, further to the Ea&s;t is another great river called <HI>Aquamenticus.</HI> There I think a good plantation may be &s;etled, for there is a good harbour for &s;hips, good ground, and much already cleared, fit for planting of corne and other fruits, having hereto|fore ben planted by the Salvages who are all dead. There is good timber, and likely to be good fi&s;hing, but as yet there hash beene no tryall made that I can heare of.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>About 6 leagues further to the Ea&s;t is a harbour cal|led <HI>Cape Porpas,</HI> the which is indifferent good for 6 &s;hippes, and it is generally thought to bean excellent place for fi&s;h, but as yet there hath been no tryall made, but there may be a good plantation &s;eated, for there is good Timber, and good ground, but will re|quire &s;ome labour and charge.</P>
<P>About foure leagues further Ea&s;t, there is another harbour called <HI>Sawco</HI> (betweene this place and <HI>Cape Porpas</HI> I lo&s;t one of my men) before we could reco|ver the harbour a great fog or mi&s;t tooke us that we could not &s;ee a hundred yards from us. I perceiving the fog to come upon the Sea, called for a Compa&s;&s;e, and &s;et the Cape land, by which wee knew how to &s;teare our cour&s;e, which was no &s;ooner done but wee lo&s;t &s;ight of land, and my other boate, and the winde blew fre&s;h again&s;t us, &s;o that we were enforced to &s;trike &s;aile, and betake us to our Oares which wee u&s;ed with all the wit and &s;trength we had, but by no meanes could we recover the &s;hore that night, being imbayed and compa&s;&s;ed round with breaches, which roared in a mo&s;t fearfull manner on every &s;ide us: wee took coun&s;ell in this extremity one of another what to doe to &s;aue our liues, at length we re&s;olved that to put to &s;ea againe in the night was no fit cour&s;e, the &s;torme being great, and the winde blowing right of the &s;hore, and to runne our boate on the &s;hore among&s;t the breaches, (which roared in a mo&s;t feare full manner) and ca&s;t her away and indanger our &s;elues we were loath to doe, &s;eeing no land nor know|ing where we were. At length I cau&s;ed our Killick (which was all the Anker we had) to be ca&s;t forth,
<PB N="4" REF="7">and one continually to hold his hand upon the roode or cable, by which we knew whether our ancker held or no: which being done wee commended our &s;elues to God by prayer, &amp; put on a re&s;olution to be as com|fortable as we could, and &s;o fell to our victuals. Thus we &s;pent that night, and the next morning, with much adoe we got in to <HI>Sawco,</HI> where I found my other boate.</P>
<P>There I &s;tayed fiue nights, the winde being con|trary, and the weather very vn&s;ea&s;onable, hauing much raine and &s;now, and continuall foggse.</P>
<P>We built us our Wigwam, or hou&s;e, in one houres &s;pace, it had no frame, but was without forme or fa|&s;hion, onely a few poles &s;et up together, and couered with our boates &s;ailes, which kept forth but a little winde, and le&s;&s;e raigne and &s;now.</P>
<P>Our greate&s;t comfort we had, next unto that which was &s;pirituall, was this, we had foule enough for kil|ling, wood enough for felling, and good fre&s;h water enough for drinking. But our beds was the wet ground, and our bedding our wet cloaths. Wee had plenty of Craine, Goo&s;e, Duckes and Mallard, with other fowle, both boyled and ro&s;ted, but our &s;pits and racks were many times in danger of burning before the meate was ready (being but wooden ones.)</P>
<P>After I had &s;tayed there three daies, and no likely|hood of a good winde to carrie vs further, I tooke with me &s;ixe of my men, and our Armes, and walked along the &s;hore, to di&s;couer as much by land as I could: after I had travelled about two Engli&s;h miles I met with a riuer which &s;tayed me that I could goe no further by land that day, but returned to our place
<PB N="5" REF="7">of habitation where we re&s;ted that night (hauing our lodging amended) for the day being dry I cau&s;ed all my company to accompany mee to a mar&s;h ground, where wee gathered euery man his burthen of long dry gra&s;&s;e, which being &s;pread in our Wigwam or Hou&s;e, I prai&s;e God I re&s;ted as contentedly as euer I did in all my life. And then came into my minde an old merry &s;aying, which I haue heard of a begger boy who &s;aid if euer he &s;hould attaine to be a King, he would haue a bre&s;t of mutton with a pudding in it, and lodge euery night vp to the eares in drye &s;traw, and thus I made my &s;elfe and my company as merry as I could, with this and &s;ome other conceits, making this v&s;e of all, that it was much better then wee de&s;er|ued at Gods hands, if he &s;hould deale with vs accor|ding to our &s;innes.</P>
<P>The next morning I cau&s;ed 4 of my men to rowe my le&s;&s;er boate to this riuer, who with much adoe got in my &s;elfe, and 3 more going by land: but by rea&s;on of the extremitie of the wether we were enforced to &s;tay there that night, and were con&s;trained to &s;leepe vpon the riuer banke, being the be&s;t place wee could finde, the &s;nowe being very deepe. The next mor|ning wee were enforced to ri&s;e betime, for the tyde came vp &s;o high that it wa&s;hed away our fire, and would haue &s;erued vs &s;o too if we had not kept watch. So wee went ouer the riuer in our boate, where I cau|&s;ed &s;ome to &s;tay with her, my &s;elfe being de&s;irous to di&s;couer further by land, I tooke with mee foure men and walked along the &s;hore about &s;ixe Engli&s;h miles further to the Ea&s;t where I found another riuer, which &s;taied mee. So we returned backe to <HI>Sawco,</HI> where the
<PB N="6" REF="8">re&s;t of my company and my other boate lay. That night I was exceeding &s;icke, by rea&s;on of the wet and cold and much toyling of my body: but thankes be to God I was indifferent well the next morning, and the winde being faire we put to &s;ea, and that day came to <HI>Quack.</HI></P>
<P>But before I &s;peake of this place I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;ome|thing of <HI>Sawco,</HI> and the too riuers which I di&s;couered in that bay, which I thinke neuer Engli&s;hman &s;aw be|fore.</P>
<P><HI>Sawco</HI> is about one league to the Northea&s;t of a cape land. And about one Engli&s;h mile from the maine lieth &s;ixe Ilands, which make an indifferent good har|bour. And in the maine there is a Coue or gutt which is about a cables length in bredth, and too cables length long, there too good Ships may ride, being well mored a head and &s;tarne, and within the Coue there is a great Mar&s;h, where at a high water a hun|dreth &s;ayle of Ships may floate, and be free from all winds, but at low water mu&s;t ly a ground, but being &s;oft oa&s;e they can take no hurte.</P>
<P>In this place there is a world of fowle, much good timber, and a great quantetie of cleare ground and good, if it be not a little too &s;andy. There hath beene more fi&s;h taken within too leagues of this place this yeare then in any other in the land.</P>
<P>The riuer next to <HI>Sawco</HI> ea&s;twards, which I di&s;co|vered by land, and after brought my boat into, is the &s;trange&s;t river that ever my eyes beheld. It flowes at the lea&s;t ten foot water upright, and yet the ebbe runs &s;o &s;trong that the tyde doth not &s;tem it: At three quar|ters floud my men were &s;carce able with foure Oares
<PB N="7" REF="8">to rowe a head. And more then that, at full Sea I dip|ped my hand in the water, quite without the mouth of the River, in the very main Ocean, and it was as fre&s;h as though it had been taken from the head of a Spring.</P>
<P>This River, as I am told by the <HI>Salvages,</HI> commeth from a great mountaine called the Chri&s;tall hill, being as they &s;ay 100 miles in the Country, yet is it to be &s;eene at the &s;ea &s;ide; and there is no &s;hip ariues in <HI>New England,</HI> either to the We&s;t &s;o farre as <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> or to the Ea&s;t &s;o farre as <HI>Monhiggen,</HI> but they &s;ee this Mountaine the fir&s;t land, if the weather be cleere.</P>
<P>The next river Ea&s;tward which I di&s;covered by land, is about &s;ixe miles from the other. About the&s;e two riuers I &s;aw much good timber and &s;andy ground, there is al&s;o much fowle, fi&s;h and other com|modities: but the&s;e places are not fit for plantation for the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e there is no good comming in, either for &s;hip or boate, by rea&s;on of a &s;andy breach which lyeth along&s;t the &s;hore, and makes all one breach.</P>
<P>And now in its place I come to <HI>Quack,</HI> which I haue named <HI>Yorke.</HI> At this place there fi&s;hed divers &s;hips of <HI>Waymouth</HI> this yeare.</P>
<P>It lyeth about two leagues to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Cape Eli|zabeth,</HI> it is a Bay or Sound betwixt the Maine and certaine Ilands which lyeth in the &s;ea about one Eng|li&s;h mile and halfe.</P>
<P>There are foure Ilands which makes one good har|bour, there is very good fi&s;hing, much fowle and the mayne as good ground as any can de&s;ire. There I fou~d one River wherein the Savages &s;ay there is much <HI>Sal|mon</HI> and other good fi&s;h. In this Bay, there hath ben
<PB N="8" REF="9">taken this yeare 4. <HI>Sturgions,</HI> by fi&s;hermen who driue only for <HI>Herrings,</HI> &s;o that it is likely there may be good &s;tore taken if there were men fit for that purpo&s;e. This River I made bold to call by my owne name <HI>Levetts</HI> river, being the fir&s;t that di&s;covered it. How farre this river is Navigable I cannot tell, I haue ben but 6. miles up it, but on both &s;ides is goodly ground.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Bay I found another River, up which I went about three miles and found a great fall, of water much bigger then the fall at <HI>London</HI> bridge at low water, further a boate cannot goe, but aboue the fall the River runnes &s;mooth againe.</P>
<P>Iu&s;t at this fall of water the <HI>Sagamore</HI> or King of that place hath a hou&s;e, where I was one day when there were two <HI>Sagamors</HI> more, their wiues and children, in all about 50. and we were but 7. They bid me wel|come and gaue me &s;uch victualls as they had, and I gaue them <HI>Tobacco</HI> and <HI>Aqua vitae.</HI> After I had &s;pent a little time with them I departed &amp; gaue them a &s;mall &s;hot, and they gaue me another. And the great <HI>Sa|gamore</HI> of the Ea&s;t Country, whom the re&s;t doe ac|knowledge to be chiefe among&s;t them, hee gaue unto me a Bevers skin, which I thankfully received, and &s;o in great loue we parted. On both &s;ides this river there is goodly ground.</P>
<P>From this harbour to <HI>Sagadahock,</HI> which is about 8. or 9. leagues, is all broken Ilands in the Sea, which makes many excellent good Harbours, where a thou|&s;and &s;aile of Shipps may ride in &s;afety; the &s;ound going up within the Ilands to the Cape of <HI>Sagadahock.</HI></P>
<P>In the way betwixt <HI>Yorke</HI> and <HI>Sagadahock</HI> lyeth <HI>Ca&s;coe,</HI> a good harbour, good fi&s;hing, good ground,
<PB N="9" REF="9">and much fowle. And I am per&s;waded that from <HI>Cape Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>Sagadahock,</HI> which is aboue 30 leagues to follow the Maine, is all exceeding commodious for Plantations: and that there may be 20 good Townes well &s;eated, to take the benefit both of the &s;ea, and fre&s;h Rivers.</P>
<P>For <HI>Sagadahock</HI> I need &s;ay nothing of it, there hath been heeretofore enough &s;aid by others, and I feare me too much. But the place is good, there fi&s;hed this yeare two &s;hips.</P>
<P>The next place I came to was <HI>Capemanwagan,</HI> a place where nine &s;hips fi&s;hed this yeare. But I like it not for a plantation, for I could &s;ee little good timber &amp; le&s;&s;e good ground, there I &s;tayed foure nights, in which time, there came many Savages with their wiues and children, and &s;ome of good accompt among&s;t them, as <HI>Menawormet</HI> a Sagamore, <HI>Cogawe&s;co</HI> the Sagamore of <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> and <HI>Quack,</HI> now called <HI>Yorke, Somer&s;et,</HI> a Saga|more, one that hath ben found very faithfull to the Engli&s;h, and hath &s;aved the liues of many of our Na|tion, &s;ome from &s;tarving, others from killing.</P>
<P>They entended to haue ben gone pre&s;ently, but hearing of my being there, they de&s;ired to &s;ee me, which I under&s;tood by one of the Ma&s;ters of the Ships, who likewi&s;e told me that they had &s;ome &s;tore of Beauer coats and skinnes, and was going to <HI>Pe|maquid</HI> to truck with one Mr. <HI>Witheridge,</HI> a Ma&s;ter of a &s;hip of <HI>Ba&s;table,</HI> and de&s;ired me to u&s;e meanes that they &s;hould not carry the~ out of the harbour, I wi&s;ht them to bring all their truck to one Mr. <HI>Cokes</HI> &s;tage &amp; I would do the be&s;t I could to put it away: &s;ome of them did accordingly, and I then &s;ent for the <HI>Saga|mores,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10">who came, and after &s;ome complements they told me I mu&s;t be their cozen, and that Captaine <HI>Gorges</HI> was &s;o, (which you may imagine I was not a little proud of, to be adopted cozen to &s;o many great Kings at one in&s;tant, but did willingly accept of it) and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing away a little time very plea&s;antly, they de&s;ired to be gone, whereupon I told them that I under&s;tood they had &s;ome coates and Beauers skins which I de&s;ired to truck for, but they were unwilling, and I &s;eemed carele&s;&s;e of it (as men mu&s;t doe if they de&s;ire any thing of them:) But at la&s;t <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> &s;wore that there &s;hould be none carryed out of the harbour, but his cozen <HI>Levett</HI> &s;hould haue all, and then they began to offer me &s;ome by way of gift, but I would take none but one paire of &s;leeues from <HI>Cogawe&s;co,</HI> but told them it was not the fa&s;hion of Engli&s;h Captaines alwaies to be taking, but &s;ometimes to take and giue, and continually to truck was very good. But in fine, we had all except one coate and two skinnes, which they re&s;erved to pay an old debt with, but they &s;ta|ying all that night, had them &s;tole from them.</P>
<P>In the morning the <HI>Sagamores</HI> came to mee with a grieuous complaint, I v&s;ed the be&s;t language I could to giue them content, and went with them to &s;ome Stages which they mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected, and &s;earched both Cabins and Che&s;ts, but found none. They &s;eeing my willingne&s;&s;e to finde the theefe out, gaue mee thankes, and wi&s;hed me to forbeare, &s;aying the Rogues had carried them into the woods where I could not find them.</P>
<P>When they were ready to depart they asked mee where I meant to &s;ettle my plantation, I told them I
<PB N="11" REF="10">had &s;eene many places to the we&s;t, and intended to goe further to the ea&s;t before I could re&s;olue, they &s;ayed there was no good place and I had heard, that <HI>Pemo|quid</HI> and <HI>Capmanwagan</HI> and <HI>Monhiggon</HI> were granted to others, &amp; the be&s;t time for fi&s;hing was then at hand which made me the more willing to retire, and the rather becau&s;e <HI>Cogawe&s;co</HI> the <HI>Sagamore</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> and <HI>Quacke,</HI> told me if that I would &s;it downe at either of tho&s;e two places, I &s;hould be very welcome, and that he and his wife would goe along with me in my boate to &s;ee them, which curte&s;ey I had no rea&s;on to refu&s;e, becau&s;e I had &s;et vp my re&s;olution before to &s;ettle my plantation at <HI>Quacke,</HI> which I named <HI>Yorke,</HI> and was glad of this oppertunity, that I had obtained the con|&s;ent of them who as I conceiue hath a naturall right of inheritance as they are the &s;onnes of <HI>Noah,</HI> and there|fore doe thinke it fit to carry things very fairely with|out compul&s;ion (if it be po&s;ible) for avoyding of treacherie.</P>
<P>The next day the winde came faire, and I &s;ayled to <HI>Quacke</HI> or <HI>Yorke,</HI> with the King, Queene, and Prince, bowe and arrowes, dogge and kettell in my boate, his noble attendance rowing by vs in their Cannow.</P>
<P>When we came to <HI>Yorke</HI> the Ma&s;ters of the Shippes came to bid me welcome, and asked what Sauages tho&s;e were, I told them, and I thanked them, they v&s;ed them kindly &amp; gaue them meate, drinke and tobacco. The woman or reputed Queene, asked me if tho&s;e men were my friends, I told her they were; then &s;he dranke to them and told them, they were welcome to her Countrey and &s;o &s;hould all my friends be at any time, &s;he dranke al&s;o to her husband and bid him welcome
<PB N="12" REF="11">to her Countrey too, for you mu&s;t vnder&s;tand, that her father was the <HI>Sagamore</HI> of this place and left it to her at his death hauing no more Children.</P>
<P>And thus after many dangers, much labour and great charge, I haue obtained a place of habitation in <HI>New-England,</HI> where I haue built a hou&s;e, and fortified it in a rea&s;onable good fa&s;hion, &s;trong enough again&s;t &s;uch enimies as are tho&s;e Sauage people.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sheweth how the Sauages, carried them&s;elues vnto me con|tinually, and of my going to their Kings Hou&s;es: and their comming to mine.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHile&s;t I &s;taied in this place I had &s;ome little trucke but not much, by rea&s;on of an euill member in the Harbour, who being couetous of trucke v&s;ed the matter &s;o, that he got the Sauages away from me.</P>
<P>And it is no wonder that he &s;hould abu&s;e me in this &s;ort, for he hath not &s;pared your Lord&s;hipps and all the Coun&s;ell for <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;aid vnto the Gouernour that the Lords had &s;ent men ouer into that Countrey with Commi&s;&s;ions, to make a prey of others. And yet for my owne part I ne|uer demanded or tooke from any man in that Coun|tery, the value of a denier, neither had I &s;o much helpe from any Shippe or Shippes companie as one mans labour the &s;pace of an houre, nor had I any pro|ui&s;ion or victuall vpon any tearmes what&s;oeuer, &s;aue onely, 1000. of bread and 22. bu&s;hells of pea&s;e, which was offered vnto mee, and not by me reque&s;ted, for
<PB N="13" REF="11">which I gaue pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction in <HI>Beuer</HI> skines: and al&s;o one Rownlet of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> which was brought to me 16. Leagues vnex&s;pected, which good manners bid me buy. Much more provi&s;ion was offered to me by many Ma&s;ters of Ships, but I had no need there|of, &s;o I gaue them thanks for their kindne&s;&s;e, and refu|&s;ed all.</P>
<P>Nay it is well knowne, that I was &s;o farre from do|ing wrong to any: that I &s;uffered the Land which was granted to me by Pattent and made choyce of before any other man came there, to be u&s;ed, and my timber to be cut downe &amp; &s;poyled, without taking or asking any &s;atisfaction for the &s;ame. And I doubt not but all others to whom you gaue authoritie, will &s;ufficiently cleare them&s;elues of all &s;uch imputations.</P>
<P>He &s;aid al&s;o he cared not for any authoritie in that place, and though he was forbid to trucke, yet would he haue all he could get: in de&s;pite of who &s;hould &s;ay to the contrary, having a great Ship with 17. peeces of Ordinance and 50. men.</P>
<P>And indeed his practi&s;e was according to his words, for every Sunday or once in the weeke, he went him|&s;elfe or &s;ent a boate up the river and got all the trucke before they could come downe to the Harbour. And &s;o many Savages as he could get to his &s;tage, hee would enforce the~ to leaue their goods behind them. One in&s;tance among&s;t marry I will giue you.</P>
<P>On a certaine day there came two Savages to his place, who were under the command of <HI>Sommer&s;et</HI> or <HI>Conway</HI> I know not whether, at which time they were both with me at my hou&s;e, but the other two who went to him, knew not &s;o much, but afterwards they
<PB N="14" REF="12">under&s;tanding of it, came prefently over, but left their Cotts and <HI>Beauer</HI> skines behind them, whereat <HI>Somer|&s;et</HI> and <HI>Conway</HI> were exceeding angrie: and were rea|dy to beate the poore fellows, but I would not &s;uffer them &s;o to doe. They pre&s;ently went over the Harbor them&s;elues in their <HI>Cannow</HI> to fetch their goods, but this man would let them haue none, but wi&s;hed them to truck with him, they told him they would not, but would carry them to Captaine <HI>Levett,</HI> he &s;aid <HI>Levett</HI> was no captaine, but a <HI>Iacknape,</HI> a poore fellow &amp;c. They told him againe that he was a <HI>Roague</HI> with &s;ome other &s;peeches, whereupon he and his company fell upon them &amp; beate them both, in &s;o much that they came to me in a great rage again&s;t him, and &s;aid, they would be revenged on his Fi&s;hermen at &s;ea, and much adoe I had to di&s;wade one of them for going into <HI>England</HI> to tell King <HI>Iames</HI> of it, as he &s;aid; when they came to me in this rage, there was two or three Ma|&s;ters of Shippes by, and heard every word.</P>
<P>But all this did me no hurt, (&s;aue the lo&s;&s;e of the trucke, which by divers was thought to be worth a|boue 50. li.) for the two <HI>Sagamores</HI> whom he inticed from me, and incen&s;ed again&s;t me, at length u&s;ed meanes to be freinds with me, &s;ending one who asked me, if I were angrie with them, I told them no, I was not angrie with them for any &s;uch matter as low&s;ie Cotts and skinnes, but if they were <HI>Matchett,</HI> that is, naughtie men, and rebellious: then I could be <HI>Mou|chick Hoggery,</HI> that is very angry, and would <HI>Cram,</HI> that is, kill them all.</P>
<P>When they came them &s;elues to me to &s;eeke peace, they brought me a <HI>Beauer</HI> Coate, and two <HI>Otters</HI> kines
<PB N="15" REF="12">which they would haue let me had for nothing, but I would not take them &s;o, but gaue them more then v|&s;ually I did by way of Trucke, I then told them like|wi&s;e that if at any time they did Trucke with mee, they &s;hould haue many good things in leiu of their Beauer: and if they did not Trucke it was no matter, I would be good friends with them, at which they &s;miled and talked one to the other, &s;aying the other man was a Iacknape, and that I had the right fa&s;hion of the <HI>Aberieney Sagamores,</HI> then they began to ap|plaude or rather flatter me, &s;aying I was &s;o bigge a <HI>Sa|gamore,</HI> yea foure fathom, which were the be&s;t words they could v&s;e to expre&s;&s;e their minds: I replied that I was a poore man as he had reported of mee. They &s;aid againe it was no matter what I &s;aid, or that <HI>Iack|nape</HI> (which is the mo&s;t di&s;gracefull word that may be in their conceite,) for all the <HI>Sagamores</HI> in the Coun|try loued poore <HI>Leuett</HI> and was <HI>muchicke</HI> &s;orie that he would be gon, (and indeed I cannot tell what I &s;hould thinke of them, for euer after they would bring mee any thing they thought would giue mee content, as Egges and the whole bodyes of <HI>Beauer,</HI> which in my coneite eate like <HI>Lambe,</HI> and is not inferiour to it: yea the very coats of <HI>Beauer,</HI> &amp; <HI>Otter-skinnes,</HI> from off their backes, which though I many times refu&s;ed, yet not allwaies, but I neuer tooke any &s;uch courte&s;ie from them but I requited them an&s;werably, chu&s;ing rather to neglect the pre&s;ent profit, then the hopes I haue to bring them to better things, which I hope will be for a publicke good, and which I am per&s;waded were a|greeuous &s;inne, to neglect for any &s;ini&s;ter end.</P>
<P>And a little before my departure there came the&s;e <GAP DESC="missing">
<PB N="16" REF="13"><HI>mores</HI> to &s;ee mee, <HI>Sadamoyt</HI> the great <HI>Sagamore</HI> of the Ea&s;t Countrey, <HI>Manawormet, Opparunwit, Skedragu&s;|cett, Cogawe&s;co, Somer&s;ett, Conway</HI> and others.</P>
<P>They asked me why I would be gone out of their Countrey, I was glad to tell them my wife would not come thither except I did fetch her, they bid a pox on her hounds, (a phra&s;e they haue learned and doe v&s;e when they doe cur&s;e) and wi&s;hed me to beate her. I told them no, for then our God would bee angrie. Then they runne out vpon her in euill tearmes, and wi&s;hed me let her alone and take another, I told them our God would be more angrie for that. Againe they bid me beate her, beate her, repeating it often, and very angerly, but I an&s;wered no, that was not the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, and be&s;ides, &s;he was a good wife and I had children by her, and I loued her well, &s;o I &s;atisfi|ed them. Then they told me that I and my wife and Children, with all my friends &s;hould bee hartily wel|come into that Countrey at any time, yea a hundreth thou&s;and times, yea <HI>Mouchicke, Mouchicke,</HI> which is a word of waight.</P>
<P>And <HI>Somer&s;ett</HI> tould that his Sonne (who was borne, whil&s;t I was in the Countrey, and whom hee would needs haue to Name) and mine &s;hould be Bro|thers and that there &s;hould be <HI>mouchicke legamatch,</HI> (that is friend&s;hip) betwixt them, untill <HI>Tanto</HI> carried them to his <HI>Wigwam,</HI> (that is, vntill that they died.</P>
<P>Then they mu&s;t know of mee how long I would be wanting, I told them &s;o many Months, at which they &s;eemed to be well plea&s;ed, but wi&s;ht me to take heede I proued not <HI>Chechaske</HI> in that (that is, a lier.) They asked me what I would doe with my hou&s;e, I told
<PB N="17" REF="13">them I would leaue 10. of my men there vntill I came againe, and that they &s;hould kill all the <HI>Tarrantens</HI> they &s;hould &s;ee (being enimies to them) and with whom the Engli&s;h haue no comar&s;&s;e. At which they reioyced exceedingly, and then agreed among&s;t them|&s;elues, that when the time &s;hould be expired, which I &s;poke of for my returne, euery one at the place where he liued would looke to the Sea, and when they did &s;ee a Ship they wold &s;end to all the <HI>Sagamores</HI> in the Countrey, and tell them that poore <HI>Leuett</HI> was come againe. And thus in&s;teed of doing me hurt, I thinke that either he or I haue done good to all Plan|ters, by winning their affections, (which may bee made v&s;e of without tru&s;ting of them.)</P>
<P>But if your Lord&s;hip &s;hould put up this wrong done unto you, and the Authority which you gaue them, never expect to be obeyed in tho&s;e parts, ei|ther by Planters or Fi&s;hermen; for &s;ome haue not &s;tucke to &s;ay, that if &s;uch a man, contemning autho|rity, and abu&s;ing one of the coun&s;ell, and drawing his knife upon him at his own hou&s;e, which he did, &s;hould goe unpuni&s;hed, then would not they care what they did heereafter.</P>
<P>And truely let me tell your Lord&s;hips, that if euer you intend to puni&s;h any for di&s;obedience, or conte~pt of authority, this man is a fit in&s;trument to make a pre&s;ident of, for he is rich, and this yeare will gaine the be&s;t part of 500 pounds by that Countrie, and he hath nether wife nor childe, for who&s;e &s;akes he &s;hould be &s;pared.</P>
<P>And if he goe free, as hee hath domineered over vs, to whom your Lord&s;hips gaue authority, but no
<PB N="18" REF="14">power to put it in execution, &s;o will he grow unman|nerly too vvith your Lord&s;hips, as hee hath already begunne.</P>
<P>And it vvill di&s;courage men hereafter to take any authority upon them, or to goe about to reforme any abu&s;es in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>And al&s;o it vvill hinder Planters for going over, if Fi&s;hermen be &s;uffered not onely to take avvay their truck, but al&s;o to animate the Sauages again&s;t them, for this is the vvay to cau&s;e all Planters to haue their throats cut.</P>
<P>But I leaue the&s;e things to your Lo. con&s;iderati|on, vvho haue as vvell povver as authority to puni&s;h &s;uch rebellious per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Thus hauing acquainted you vvith vvhat I haue done, &s;een, and heard; novv giue me leaue to tell you vvhat I thinke of the Savages, the inhabitants of that country: as al&s;o to iu&s;tifie the innocent, I meane the Countrie of <HI>New-England,</HI> again&s;t the &s;landerous reports of this man, and &s;ome others which I haue heard, and likewi&s;e to deliver my opinion, what cour|&s;es I conceiue to be mo&s;t convenient to be taken, for bringing mo&s;t glorie to God, comfort, honor and be|nifit to our King and our owne Natiue Nation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sheweth the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Savages,</HI> and of their &s;everall Gods, <HI>Squanto</HI> and <HI>Tanto.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Haue had much conference with the Savages, a|bout our only true God, and haue done my be&s;t to
<PB N="19" REF="14">bring them to know and acknowledge him, but I feare me all the labour that way, will be lo&s;t and no good will be done, except it be among the younger &s;ort.</P>
<P>I find they haue two Gods, on they loue: and the other the hate, the god they loue: they call <HI>Squanto,</HI> and to him they a&s;cribe all their good fortunes.</P>
<P>The god they hate they call <HI>Tanto,</HI> and to him they a&s;cribe all their euill fortunes, as thus, when any is kil|led, hurt, or &s;icke, or when it is evill wether, then they &s;ay <HI>Tanto</HI> is <HI>hoggry,</HI> that is angry. When any dyes, they &s;ay <HI>Tanto</HI> carries them to his <HI>wigwam</HI> that is his hou&s;e, and they never &s;ee them more.</P>
<P>I haue asked them where <HI>Squanto</HI> dwells, they &s;ay they cannot tell but up on high, and will poynt up|wards. And for <HI>Tanto,</HI> they &s;ay farre we&s;t, but they know not where.</P>
<P>I haue asked them if at any time they haue &s;eene <HI>Squanto,</HI> or <HI>Tanto,</HI> they &s;ay no there is none &s;ees them, but their <HI>Pawwawes,</HI> nor they neither, but when they dreame.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Pawwawes</HI> are their Phi&s;itians and Surgions, and as I verely beleeue they are all Witches, for they foretell of ill wether, and many &s;trange things, every <HI>Sagamore</HI> hath one of them belongs to his company, and they are altogether directed by them.</P>
<P>On a time I was at a <HI>Sagamores</HI> hou&s;e and &s;aw a <HI>Martins</HI> skin, and asked if he would trucke it, the <HI>Sa|gamore</HI> told me no, the <HI>Pawwawe</HI> u&s;ed to lay that un|der his head when he dreamed, and if he wanted that, he could doe nothing, thus we may perceiue how the devill deludes tho&s;e poore people and keep them in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>I find them generally to be marvelous quicke of ap|prehen&s;ion,
<PB N="20" REF="15">and full of &s;ubteltie, they will quickely find any mans di&s;po&s;ition, and flatter &amp; humour him &s;trangely, if they hope to get any thing of him. And yet will they count him a foole if he doe not &s;hevv a di&s;like of it, and vvill &s;ay on to another, that &s;uch a man is a <HI>Mechecome.</HI></P>
<P>They are &s;low of &s;peech, and if they heare a man &s;peake much they will laugh at him, and &s;ay he is a <HI>Mechecum,</HI> that is a foole.</P>
<P>If men of place be to familiar with them, they will not re&s;pect them: therefore it is to be wi&s;hed that all &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be wi&s;e in their Carriage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sagamores</HI> will &s;carce &s;peake to an ordinary man, but will point to their men, and &s;ay <HI>Sanops,</HI> mu&s;t &s;peake to <HI>Sanops,</HI> and <HI>Sagamors</HI> to <HI>Sagamors.</HI></P>
<P>They are very bloudy minded and full of Trach|erie among&s;t them&s;elues, one will kill another for their wiues, and he that hath the mo&s;t wiues is the braue&s;t fellow: therefore I would wi&s;h no man to tru&s;t them, what euer they &s;ay or doe, but alwaies to keepe a &s;trickt hand ouer them, and yet to v&s;e them kindly and deale vprightly with them; &s;o &s;hall they plea&s;e God, keepe their reputation among&s;t them, and be free from danger.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Sagamors</HI> are no Kings as I verilie beleeve, for I can &s;ee no Gouernment or Law among&s;t them but Club Law: and they call all Ma&s;ters of Shippes <HI>Saga|more,</HI> or any other man, that they &s;ee haue a com|maund of men.</P>
<P>Their wiues are their &s;laues and doe all their worke the men will doe nothing but kill Bea&s;ts Fi&s;h &amp;c.</P>
<P>On a time rea&s;oning with one of their <HI>Sagamors</HI> a|bout
<PB N="21" REF="15">there hauing &s;o many wiues, I tould him it was no good fa&s;hion, he then asked mee how many wiues King <HI>Iames</HI> had, I told him he neuer had but one, and &s;hee was dead, at which he wondred, and asked mee who then did all the Kings worke. You may Imagin he thought their fa&s;hion was vniuer&s;all, and that no King had any to worke for them but their wiufs.</P>
<P>They haue no apparrell but skinnes except they haue it from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> in winter the weare the haire &s;ide inwards, in &s;ummer outwards. They haue a peece of a skinne about their loines like a girdle and betweene their legges goes another, made fa&s;t to the girdle before and behind, which &s;erues to couer their nakedne&s;&s;e, they are all thus apparrelled, going bare headed with long haire, &s;ometimes you &s;hall not know the men from women but by their brea&s;ts, the men having no haire on their faces.</P>
<P>When their Children are borne they bind them on a peece of board, and &s;ets it vpright, either again&s;t a tree or any other place. They keep them thus bound vntill they be three months old, and after they are con|tinuall naked vntill they be about fiue or &s;ixe yeares. Yee &s;hall haue them many times take their Children &amp; bury them in the &s;now all but their faces for a time, to make them the better to indure cold: and when they are not aboue 2. yeares old, they will take them and ca&s;t them into the Sea, like a little dogge or Cat, to learne them to &s;wimme.</P>
<P>Their weapons are bowes and arrowes, I never &s;aw more then two fowling peeces, one pi&s;tall, about foure Halfe-pikes, and three Curt-laces among&s;t them, &s;o that we neede not to feare them much, if wee auoid
<PB N="22" REF="16">their Treacherie.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are built in halfe an houres &s;pace being onely a few powles or boughes &s;tucke in the ground and couered with the barkes of trees.</P>
<P>Their Language differs as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &amp; <HI>Wel&s;h.</HI> On a time the Gouernour was at my hou&s;e, and brought with him a <HI>Salvage</HI> who liued not aboue 70. miles from the place which I haue made choi&s;e of, vvho talking vvith another <HI>Sauage</HI> they vvere glad to v&s;e broken <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> to expre&s;&s;e their mind each to other, not being a|ble to vnder&s;tand one another in their Language.</P>

<P>Thus haue I relaited vnto you what I haue &s;eene, and doe know may be had in tho&s;e parts of <HI>New-En|gland</HI> where I haue beene, yet was I neuer at the <HI>Me&s;a|chu&s;ett,</HI> which is counted the Paradice of <HI>New-En|gland,</HI> nor at <HI>Cape Ann.</HI> But I feare there hath been too faire a glo&s;&s;e &s;et on <HI>Cape Ann.</HI> I am told there is a good Harbour which makes a faire Inuitation, but where they are in their entertainement is not an&s;wer|able, for there is little good ground, and the Shippes which fi&s;hed there this yeare, their boats went twen|ty miles to take their Fi&s;h, and yet they were in great feare of making their Voyages, as one of the Ma&s;ters confe&s;&s;ed vnto me who was at my hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither was I at <HI>New-Plimoth,</HI> but I feare that place is not &s;o good as many other, for if it were in my con|ceite, they would content them&s;elues with it and not &s;eeke for any other hauing ten times &s;o much ground as would &s;erue ten times &s;o many people as they haue now among&s;t them.

<P>Neither was I euer farther to the We&s;t, then the Iles of <HI>Shoulds.</HI></P>
<P>Thus haue I done with my commendations of the
<PB N="25" REF="17">Countrie. I will now &s;peake the wor&s;t I know by it.</P>
<P>About the middle of May you &s;hall haue little Flies, called <HI>Musketoes,</HI> which are like Gnatts, they continue as I am told, vntill the la&s;t of Iuly. The&s;e are very trouble&s;ome for the time, for they &s;ting ex|ceedingly both night and day. But I found by expe|rience that bootes or thicke &s;tockings would &s;aue the legges, gloues the hands, and tiffeney or &s;ome &s;uch things which will not much hinder the &s;ight will &s;aue the face, and at night any &s;moake will &s;ecure a man.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of the aboundance of the&s;e creatures, I take to be the woods which hinders the aire, for I haue ob&s;erued allwaies when the winde did blow but a little, we were not much troubled with them.</P>
<P>And I verily thinke that if there were a good num|ber of people planted together, and that the woods were cut downe, the earth were tilled, and the rubbi&s;h which lieth on the ground wherein they breed were burnt, and that there were many chimneyes &s;moaking, &s;uch &s;mall creatures would doe but little hurt.</P>
<P>Another euill or inconuenience I &s;ee there, the the &s;now in winter did lie very long vpon the ground.</P>
<P>But I vnder&s;tand that all the parts of Chri&s;tendome, were troubled with a cold winter &s;o well as wee. Yet would I aske any man what hurt &s;now doeth? The husbandman will &s;ay that Corne is the better for it. And I hope Cattell may bee as well fed in the hou&s;e there as in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and other Countries, and he is but an ill husband that cannot find imployments for his &s;eruants within doores for that time. As for Wiues and Children if they bee wi&s;e they will keepe them&s;elues clo&s;e by a good fire, and for men they will

<P>Yet let me tell you that it is &s;till a mo&s;t Chri&s;tmas before there be any winter there, &s;o that the cold time doth not continue long.</P>
<P>And by all rea&s;on that Countrey &s;hould be hotter then <HI>England,</HI> being many Degrees farther from he North Pole.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Certaine obiections and an&s;wers, with &s;ufficient proues how it may be exceeding profitable to the Com|mon-wealth, and all planters and adventurers.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THey &s;ay the Country is good for nothing but to &s;tarue &s;o many people as comes in it.</P>
<P>It is granted that &s;ome haue beene &s;tarued to death, and others haue hardly e&s;caped, but vvhere vvas the fault, in the Country or in them&s;elues. That
<PB N="27" REF="18">the Country is as I haue &s;aid, I can bring 100 men to iu&s;tifie it; but if men be neither indu&s;trious nor provident, they may &s;tarue in the be&s;t place of the world.</P>
<P>About two yeares &s;ince one Mr. <HI>We&s;ton</HI> &s;ent ouer about 50 per&s;ons to plant, with little proui&s;ion; vvhen they came there, they neither applyed them&s;elues to planting of corne nor taking of fi&s;h, more then for their pre&s;ent u&s;e, but vvent about to build Ca&s;tles in the Aire, and making of Forts, neg|lecting the plentifull time of fi&s;hing. When Winter came their forts vvould not keepe out hunger, and they hauing no provi&s;ion before hand, and wanting both powder and &s;hot to kill Deere and Fowle, many vvere &s;tarued to death, and the re&s;t hardly e&s;caped. There are foure of his men which e&s;caped, now at my plantation, who haue related unto me the whole bu&s;ine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Againe, this la&s;t yeare there went ouer diuer&s;e at one time, and to one place, with too little proui&s;ion, &s;ome of them are dead, yet I cannot heare of any that were meerely &s;tarued, except one who&s;e name was <HI>Chapman,</HI> a <HI>Londoner,</HI> and whether he was &s;tarued or no is uncertaine; but if he were, Gods iu&s;t iudgement did appeare. For this man (as I am told, by an hone&s;t man, who came from <HI>London</HI> with him) brought at the lea&s;t 80 pound worth of proui&s;ion, and no more but him&s;elfe and two &s;ervants, which was &s;ufficient for at the lea&s;t 18 moneths, if it had been well u&s;ed. And yet in 5 moneths after his arivall in <HI>New England</HI> he dyed mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>Let me tell you a &s;trange thing of this man (I haue it
<PB N="28" REF="19">but by relation from one of his companions) he pay|ed for his pa&s;&s;age, and his mens, and provi&s;ion, &s;o that he needed not to haue &s;pent any thing untill his arival in New England, yet would he at <HI>Plimoth</HI> (where the &s;hip &s;tayed too long for him and others, &s;pent &s;even or eight pound a week in wine, Tobacco, and whores, and for the maintaining of this expence he daily fet|ched his provi&s;ion from aboard, and &s;old it at a low rate. And when they were at Sea, his Tobacco being &s;pent, he gaue u&s;ually &s;ixe pence for a pipe; he gaue al&s;o a &s;ute of cloaths, valewed to be worth 50 &s;hillings for &s;o much Tobacco as was not worth halfe a crowne. Nay at la&s;t, as his Comrade told me, he was glad to become &s;ervant to one of his &s;ervants. Then his Ma&s;ter told him, that if he would work hee would allow him one bisket cake a day, if not he &s;hould haue but halfe a cake. He made choice of halfe a cake, vvithout vvork; and &s;o a ba&s;e lazie fellow made a la|mentable end. Where vvas the faultnow, in the men, or the Country?</P>
<P>Another obiection which I haue met vvith is this: That there is nothing got or &s;aued by &s;ending men ouer to plant; neither is it beneficiall either to private men, either Aduenturer or Planter, or good for the Common-wealth.</P>
<P>For an&s;wer hereunto, fir&s;t for matter of profite, it is vvell knowne to all the Marchants of the We&s;t Country, vvho haue left almo&s;t all other Trade but this, and yet is growne rich thereby.</P>
<P>Secondly, for the Common-wealth con&s;ider the&s;e things: 1 the great complaint that hath for a long time beene made in <HI>England,</HI> that our land is over|burthened
<PB N="29" REF="19">vvith people, and that there is no imploy|ment for our men; &s;o that it is likely they mu&s;t either &s;tarue, &s;teale, or proue mutinous. And vvhether plan|tations be a meanes to help this inconvenience or no, I de&s;ire to know?</P>
<P>It hath beene likevvi&s;e &s;aid unto me, that it benefits the Common-vvealth nothing at all to &s;end men ouer vvith provi&s;ion of cloathes victuals, and continuall &s;upplies.</P>
<P>To that I &s;ay, let &s;uch men as you &s;end thither to plant haue provi&s;ion as <HI>Chapman</HI> had for 18 monthes, and if after they cannot liue of them&s;elues, and be beneficiall either to the common wealth or to them|&s;elues, let them dye <HI>Chapmans</HI> death.</P>
<P>Againe, Plantations may be benificiall to the Com|mon wealth, by the enlargement of his Maje&s;ties Do|minions.</P>
<P>Againe, by the increa&s;e of Shipping, (which is the &s;trength of a Nation, and that without wa&s;ting of our timber which is a commoditie that I feare <HI>England</HI> will find the want off before many yeares pa&s;&s;e over, for if timber goe to decay as now it doth, we &s;hall &s;carce haue any to build or repare, Ships or hou&s;es. Againe tell me whither it would be benifitiall to the Common-wealth to haue all our idle per&s;ons keept to worke and our populous Nation disburthened, and yet to haue them ready to &s;erue our King and Countrey vpon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, tell me whither it would be benifitiall to the Common-wealth to haue all poore people maintain|ed out of tho&s;e Artes. And euerie parri&s;h freed from their weekely paiments to the poore, which if I
<PB N="30" REF="20">doe make to appeare, then let me be accounted an vn|worthy fellow. But fir&s;t let me &s;et downe an other ob|iection, which &s;eemes to be of great force, and yet in my conceit is like the re&s;t &s;hallow, and that is this.</P>
<P>If &s;ay they there be &s;o many plantations, there will be no roome in the Countrey for &s;uch Ships as doe come yearely to make voiages, and by this meanes Shippes &s;hall lye &s;till and decay Marriners and Fi&s;her|men &s;hall want imployment, and &s;o all will be out of frame if euer we &s;hall haue warres. And therefore how&s;oeuer it may be benefitiall to &s;ome few per&s;ons, yet it will be hurtfull to the Common-wealth. And con&s;equently all &s;uch as haue any hand in &s;uch bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es are euill members in the Common-wealth.</P>
<P>I an&s;were that if the&s;e things were throughly exami|ned by his Maie&s;tie, the Parliament or Coun&s;ell Table, it would plainely appeare, that the mo&s;t of them which keepe &s;uch adoe again&s;t Plantations, are the greate&s;t enimies to the publique good, and that their &s;hew of care for the Commo-wealth is nothing but a colour, for the more cleanely concealing of their vn|knowne profits. It will al&s;o appeare, that plantati|ons are for the publique good and by that meanes there &s;hall be more an better cheape Shippes built, and imploied, more Mariners and Fi&s;hermen keept to worke then now there are, and more people per|takers of the benefits then now there oth.</P>
<P>Which I proue thus, fir&s;t there may be Timber had to build Shippes, and ground for Corne and keeping of Cattel, and all for little or nothing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sheweth, how by adventuring of a <HI>100.</HI> pounds more on le&s;&s;e, a man may profite &s;o much euery yeare, for <HI>20.</HI> yeares or longer, without any more charge then at the fir&s;t.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e I haue &s;tudied no other Art a longe time but the My&s;teries of <HI>New Englands</HI> Trade, and I hope at la&s;t: I haue attained to the under&s;tanding of the &s;ecrets of it, which I thinke the Fi&s;hermen are &s;orie for. But it &s;hall be no longer concealed, for that I thinke every good &s;ubiect is bound to preferre the publicke, beforre his owne private good.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="21">
<P>Fir&s;t therefore, I will &s;hew you the charge which every Marchant is at yearely, in &s;ending their Shipes to fi&s;h there, and &s;o neere as I can the profit they make of &s;uch Voyages. Then we will &s;ee the charge which planters mu&s;t be at, in &s;ending men over to &s;tay there, and the profit they are likely to make, and &s;o by com|paring the one with the other, we &s;hall &s;ee, which is the better and more profitable cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A Shipp of 200. Tunn, commonly doth carrie in tho&s;e Voyages 50. men, the&s;e men are at no charge but 20. &s;hillings a man towards their vittels, neither haue they any waiges, but in leiu thereof they haue one third part of all the fi&s;h and trayne.</P>
<P>Another third part there is allowed the owners of the Shippe for their fraught, and the other third part is allowed for the victuall, &s;alte, nets, hookes lines and other implements for taking and making the Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The charge of victualling (which is v&s;ually for 9. Mounths,) the &s;alte &amp;c. doth commonly amount to about 800 pounds, and for that they haue (as I &s;aid one third part of the Fi&s;h) which is, neere 67. tunne, the Shippe being laiden, which will make 1340, Kin|talls, (at the Market) &s;ometimes when they come to a good Market they &s;ell their Fi&s;h for 44. Rialls a Kin|tall, and &s;o to 36 Rialls, which is the lea&s;t, but &s;ay they haue 40, one time with another, and at that rate one third of that Shippes layding doth yeeld 1340 pounds, which they haue for disbur&s;ing of 800 pounds nine Mounths.</P>
<P>Now take notice that they are but 8 or 10 weekes in taking all their Fi&s;h, and about one Mounth lon|ger in making it fit to be Shipped.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="21">
<P>Which being con&s;idered, then &s;ay that &s;uch men as are &s;ent ouer to plant, haue 12 Months proui&s;io~, which wil amount to 1066 pounds 13 &s;hillings 4 pence, the&s;e men &s;tay in the Countrey, and doe take the benefit both of the fir&s;t &amp; la&s;t fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, &amp; all other opor|tunities, the Fi&s;hing continuing good, at the lea&s;t &s;ea|uen Moneths in the yeare, though not all at one time: now I hope you will grant that they are as likelie to take two Shippes lading as the other one, which if they doe, one third thereof at the &s;ame rate will a|mount to 2680 pounds, the charge you are at being deducted, the profit is 1019 pounds 6 &s;hillings 8 pence. Now tell me &s;eriou&s;ly, which is the more profitable cour&s;e?</P>
<P>Againe con&s;ider, that in all likelihood this Fi&s;h is to be taken in 5. Moneths, then haue you 7. Moneths more to imploy your men in the Countrey euery yeare, about building of Shippes, cleauing of pipe|&s;taues, or any other thing, and will that be worth no|thing?</P>
<P>Truely this I will &s;ay, &s;end men ouer but with 18 Moneths proui&s;ion, and Cattell, and Corne to plant, and other nece&s;&s;aries, and they &s;hall afford you thus much profit yearely, without euer putting you to more charge if God ble&s;&s;e them with health, and you from lo&s;&s;es, (and I neuer heard of any great lo&s;&s;e by aduenturing thither) and that you bee fitted with good and vnder&s;tanding men to ouer &s;ee the bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e, who is able to direct them.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AND thus haue I &s;hewed you what hopes there is of profit by plantations, yet haue I &s;hewed you no other meanes to rai&s;e it, but by fi&s;h and timber. I would not haue you &s;ay there is nothing el&s;e in the Country to make any benefite of; for I a&s;&s;ure you it is well knowne to my &s;elfe, and o|thers who haue beene there, that there are diver&s;e other good things there to be had; but I doe not loue to &s;peake of all at one time, but to re&s;erue &s;ome, to &s;top the mouths of &s;uch prating coxcombs as will ne|uer be &s;atisfied with any rea&s;on, but will alwaies ca|vill though to little purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>To that I an&s;wer, I &s;peak not what euery &s;hip doth, but what &s;ome doe, and all others may doe, if they be in the Country to take all opportunities.</P>
<P N="2">2 Obict. That it is not po&s;&s;ible to make Planta|tions
<PB N="35" REF="22">&s;o publicke a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, as that it &s;hould redound to the benefit of all the Kings Subiects.

<P>But I would aske &s;uch men whether they be &s;o void of charity, as that they will not doe them&s;elues good, becau&s;e &s;ome others &s;hall haue &s;ome by it al&s;o?

<P>My de&s;ire is not that any &s;hould be compelled. One|ly this I could wi&s;h, that euery pari&s;h would adventure &s;o much as they pay weekly to the reliefe of the poore (which is no great matter.) And &s;o euery &s;hire by it &s;elfe, would &s;end ouer men to plant. And if after 18 moneths they &s;hall not yearely returne &s;o much pro|fits continually as will keep their poore, and ea&s;e their pur&s;es (prouided alwaies, as I &s;aid before, that they &s;end &s;uch men as are fit, and that the Iu&s;tices of eue|ry Shire be carefull to appoint &s;uch a man to be their Captaine and Director as is hone&s;t, and of good vn|der&s;tanding, and that God ble&s;&s;e them from lo&s;&s;es,) will I be contented to &s;uffer death.</P>
<P>And yet let me tell you, that if it &s;hould plea&s;e God, that once in &s;euen yeares a &s;hip &s;hould bee ca&s;t
<PB N="34" REF="23">away (which is more then hath beene u&s;uall, for I dare &s;ay, that for euery &s;hip that is ca&s;t away in tho&s;e voyages, there is 100 which commeth &s;afe) yet it is but that yeares profite lo&s;t, and perhaps not halfe.</P>
<P>Another obiection may be this, That all men are not Fi&s;hermen, and that it is not &s;o ea&s;ie a thing to take fi&s;h, as I make it.</P>
<P>To that I an&s;wer, That take a &s;urvey of all the men that goeth in the&s;e voyages, and there &s;hall not bee found one third of them that are meerly fi&s;hermen, and no other Trades.</P>
<P>Nay, I know many &s;hip-Companies, that haue among&s;t them hou&s;e-Carpenters, Ma&s;ons, Smiths, Taylors, Shooemakers, and &s;uch like, and in deed it is mo&s;t fit they &s;hould be &s;uch: and I &s;aw by experi|ence, that divers who were never at Sea before this yeare, proued very good fi&s;hermen: but I could wi&s;h that euer a fi&s;t part of a Company be Fi&s;hermen, and the re&s;t will quickly be trained up, and made skilfull.</P>
