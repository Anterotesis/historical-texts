<HEAD>The Earle of War|wicks great Victory over 50. Ships of the King of <HI>Denmarkes</HI> in the Narrow-Seas.</HEAD>
<P>_THe King of <HI>Den|marke</HI> under|&s;tanding by the manifold infor|mation of ma|ny, that his Bro|ther the King of great <HI>Brit|taine</HI> was di&s;u|nited from the Parliament, and his in|dignation being highly incen&s;ed, that he was re&s;olved to make Warre again&s;t his great Councell, and Supream Court,
<PB REF="3"> began to a&s;&s;emble his Subjects, de&s;iring their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to ayd his Brother in the intended Warre. And after great debate, and con&s;ultation thereabout, hee concluded immediatly to prepare certain Ships for <HI>England.</HI> The number of tho&s;e &s;hips which the King of <HI>Den|marke</HI> had in preparation, were 100, and 50. of them already fitted on Sea, conducting with them in the &s;aid &s;hips many Hor&s;es and Hay, as the informa|tion thereof was reported to the hou&s;e of Commons by a Merchant, that was lately come from <HI>Norway.</HI> Whereupon the Hou&s;e of Commons without any further procra&s;tination or detraction of any longer time Ordered incontinent|ly, that information &s;hould be &s;ent withall expedition to the Earle of <HI>War|wicke,</HI> Lord Generall for the Sea, de&s;i|ring him to be very vigilant and care|full at Sea, lea&s;t any &s;uddaine and un|expected inva&s;ion might ru&s;h in upon the Kingdome.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>Wherefore as &s;oone as the Earle of <HI>Warwicke</HI> had received this particular intention from the Parliament, he pre|&s;ently &s;et all the &s;hips in readine&s;&s;e, and began to be very cautious, &s;etting &s;treight watch every night, lea&s;t unawares the <HI>Denmarks</HI> by &s;ome policy or Stratagem might invade the Land by night.</P>
<P>The ninth day of this pre&s;ent moneth the <HI>Denmarkes</HI> appeared in the Nar|row Seas &s;uperbiou&s;ly, comming to <HI>England</HI> with fifty &s;hips loaden with great &s;tore of Ammunition, Hor&s;e and Hay, but as &s;oone as the Earle of <HI>War|wicke</HI> perceived his &s;ine&s;ter intents, he went again&s;t him with one and twen|ty &s;hips, and mo&s;t valiantly with an undanted courage let off thirty pieces of Ordnance again&s;t the <HI>Denmarke,</HI> fol|lowing very couragiou&s;ly, in&s;omuch that he made them almo&s;t recant, and turne Sayle The <HI>Demarks</HI> on the other &s;ide be|haved them&s;elves bravely at the fir&s;t encounter, and gave the Engli&s;h above
<PB REF="4"> three&s;core and ten &s;hootes, which had beene &s;ufficient to have &s;unke &s;ome of our &s;hips, but that they were placed &s;o wi&s;ely, and craftily, that wee had a great advantage of them, becau&s;e we had the Wind withall on our &s;ide. And the Lord Generall had regulated the &s;hips in &s;uch an equall way, that at the &s;econd di&s;charge they were compelled to turne Sayle and fly, but two of the&s;e Ships were taken; wherein there was found great &s;tore of Ammunition, and the re&s;t e&s;caped by flight.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider how <HI>Arminiani&s;me</HI> was diffu&s;ed in the Church, and &s;ince the Parliament how many ob&s;tructions and pernicious ob&s;tacles have beene layd to interrupt their a&s;&s;iduous pro|ceedings: all which if they be with mature deliberation &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ide|red, we &s;hall with facility and appa|rent and per&s;picuous demon&s;trations perceive the wonderfull mercies of Al|mighty God towards us. For which
<PB REF="4"> we are bound in duty towards God to magnifie his holy and omnipotent Name, fortheir is nothing more odious and dete&s;table to God then ungrati|tude, for it is a wicked in&s;trument, that oftentimes cau&s;eth God to divert and turne away his ble&s;sings to a Na|tion. Therefore above all things let us be &s;ure to embrace gratitude, and offer it as an Oblation and au&s;pitious Sacri|fice to God, glorifying him for all the&s;e mercies, and withall &s;o be&s;eeching in our &s;upplications, that he would pre&s;erve and defend the Parliament from the malignity of all ill-di&s;po&s;ed people.</P>
<P>The Parliament have &s;ince mo&s;t di&s;|creetly, and judiciou&s;ly Ordered, That a great charge of the State of the Kings Ships &s;hould be forthwith taken. And withall by their appointment, the Na|vy at Sea is made wonderfull &s;trong. For there is one and fifty &s;hips under the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Command, with
<PB REF="5"> five hundred pieces of Ordnance, and &s;et out with &s;uch Ammunition, and provi&s;ions of Armes, as hath not been &s;een, and knowne the like for number, and &s;trength &s;ent out by any Prince in this Kingdome by force.</P>
<P>The Charge whereof hath amounted to 300000 pounds which hath beene rai&s;ed out of the Bill for Tonnage and Poundage. And al&s;o the King hath re|ceived 100000 pound out of the bene|fit of the &s;ame Bill &s;ince May was twelve Moneths.</P>
<P>The Earle of <HI>Stamford,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ru|tham,</HI> and Sir <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerigg</HI> were ap|pointed by the Parliament to &s;ee the <HI>Militia</HI> put in execution in <HI>Leice&s;ter|&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons Ordered al&s;o that there &s;hould be 10000 pound pre&s;ently &s;ent to <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and 6000 pound to <HI>Dublin</HI> to pay the Souldiers.</P>
