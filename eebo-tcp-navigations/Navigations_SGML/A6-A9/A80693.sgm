<P>THere is moreover the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, who is alwaies a Praelate; (for you mu&s;t know, that the Pope never gives the title of <HI>Majordomo</HI> to any) as al&s;o the Ma&s;ter of the Chamber; the Cup|bearer, the Sewer; the chiefe Harbinger, the Carver; the under-ma&s;ter of the Chamber; the under cupbearer; the un|der-Sewer; &amp; the under-Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e; together with &s;ecret Chamber|laines, of whom the Pope declares &s;even or eight participant-chamberlaines, as &s;eem|eth good to his Holine&s;&s;e.

There is be&s;ides an other &s;ecret Chamberlaine, that is Wardrobe-keeper, who hath an under-Wardrobe-keeper, and goes in purple. There are other Adjutants likewi&s;e. Now it is to be noted, that the &s;aid Wardrobe|keeper hath not in his charge, either hang|ings, beds, or other &s;uch like &s;tuffe, but on|ly Iewels, Reliques, Gold, Silver, and other things of great value. They doe al&s;o di|&s;tribute
<PB N="10" REF="10"> daily the ble&s;t <HI>Agnus Dei's,</HI> which are made in the &s;aid Wardrobe.

<P>The entertainement of a &s;ecret Cham|berlaine amounts to a thou&s;and crownes a yeare, and he that is a participant-cham|berlaine hath eight or nine hundred crownes more then tho&s;e that are not par|ticipants, becau&s;e they participate of the rewards and donatives, which are given to the Popes Chamber, and of &s;ome pro|fits of the Apo&s;tolicall Chancerie.</P>

Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eighth alwaies kept &s;ixe &s;ecret chaplaines, among&s;t whom was a German, a Spaniard, a Frenchman, a Polander, and a Iappone&s;e, who was at|tyred after the manner of his country, but

<P>There are al&s;o the Chaplaines of the Guards and Palfreymen, to the end they may hear Ma&s;&s;e every morning, who are called common Chaplaines.</P>

It fell from that cu&s;tome in the year 1071. under <HI>Alexander</HI> the &s;e|cond, after who&s;e time it was alwaies in the hands of Prie&s;ts, or Deacon-Cardinals. <HI>Gregory</HI> the eight, who had this Office, be|ing

<P>This Office under <HI>Boniface</HI> the eight, re|turned into the &s;acred Colledge of Cardi|nalls, and was given to <HI>Ricardo Pelroni,</HI> a Nobleman of <HI>Siena,</HI> who being made a Cardinal, never remembring the antient in&s;titution, continued Vice-chancellor, and &s;o thorough heedle&s;ne&s;&s;e it came to be the name of the Office.</P>

Whereupon the Pope with a loud voyce &s;aith thus: To the honour of the invi&s;ible Trinity, for exaltation of the Catholique faith, and augmentation of the Chri&s;tian Religion, We by the autho|rity of the &s;aid God Almighty, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Gho&s;t, and the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> doe by the advice

<P>This word, as it is likely, was found out in the time of Pope <HI>Higinius,</HI> an hundred and fifty yeares after Chri&s;t, whereas many Prie&s;ts were placed in Pari&s;hes, and degrees of them &s;etled, whereupon the Office be|ing
<PB N="103" REF="57"> found, it was probable the name was then al&s;o found.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mention of the word Cardinall was in the time of Saint <HI>Silve&s;ter,</HI> three hundred yeres after Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord appeared by the Synod held in Rome un|der Saint <HI>Silve&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>This word Cardinal is at this day com|mon to three degrees; to Prie&s;ts, Deacons, and Bi&s;hops. At the fir&s;t, as we &s;ee before, it was given to Prie&s;ts only, who&s;e Office it was then in particular, to have a care of the buriall of the Faithfull, whereunto the other Prie&s;ts were not admitted, as is ex|tant in <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius</HI> the <HI>Bibliothecarie</HI> in the life of Pope <HI>Marcellus.</HI> As for the re&s;t, the Prie&s;ts were equall, in preaching, in admi|ni&s;tring the Sacraments (except Bap|ti&s;me as I have already &s;aid) in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Pope, in being imployed as Legates; and this before <HI>Constantine.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Constantine,</HI> the Prie&s;t Cardinalls began to have I know not what kind of more prerogative above other Prie&s;ts that were not Cardinals; &s;o that leaving off that particular care of Bapti&s;me, and Burialls, they onely went forth in Legations, and of them above for the mo&s;t part was the Pope made, having power over the Prie&s;ts, and
<PB N="104" REF="58"> Clerks of their juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>This continued &s;ixe hundred yeares, un|till <HI>Gregory</HI> the &s;eventh; at which time, a&s;|well by the Emperor, as of the re&s;t of the Clergy, and people from the election, the authority of the Cardinalls increa&s;ed, for that they were they alone, which made the Pope, and commonly out of their own order. Now that they might maintaine their dignity, the revenew of their Titles not being &s;ufficient for many of them, they began to have <HI>in commenda</HI> &s;imple Benefi|ces, Canon&s;hips, Archpresbyters, and the like.</P>
<P>When a Bi&s;hoprick was given to any of the&s;e, the dignity of Cardinall was void, as inferior to the other. Afterwards, when they were made Bi&s;hops, they demanded that by way of grace they might retaine the nomination only, leaving the title of Prie&s;t, calling them&s;elves <HI>Sanctae Romanae Eccle&s;iae Cardinales,</HI> without title, but <HI>Cardi|nales Eccle&s;iae Dei.</HI> In the time of Pope <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> the third, after they were made Bi|&s;hops, perceiving that to bee a Cardinall was a great importance for their attaining to the Papacie, and for their intervening in their election of the Pope, they began to retaine the Title, as to be both Bi&s;hop
<PB N="105" REF="58"> of a place, &amp; a Cardinal of Rome together, howbeit with this adverti&s;ement, that no Bi&s;hop was made a Cardinall, becau&s;e it was reputed a de&s;cending in degree: but if the Cardinall was made a Bi&s;hop, he retai|ned both the one and the other.</P>
<P>In proce&s;&s;e of time, the Bi&s;hops begin|ning to de&s;ire to be Cardinalls, &s;ought for meanes to make Cardinalls that were no Prie&s;ts, but they were not able to doe it untill <HI>Boniface</HI> the eight was Pope, when as the Court went to <HI>Avignion,</HI> where every thing going to confu&s;ion, both Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons were made Cardi|nalls; and Cardinals had Bi&s;hopricks, and Abbacies more then one, given them <HI>in commenda:</HI> upon this occa&s;ion too the Car|dinalls began to proceed Bi&s;hops, that were meere Bi&s;hops; and this precedencie began not ab&s;olutely, but in <HI>Avignion.</HI></P>

<P>THere are here to be noted three things, the fir&s;t, in regard the tran|&s;lation from one Bi&s;hoprick to another was anciently held inconvenient, for three hundred yeares &s;pace together, namely, to the yeare nine hundred, none that was a Bi&s;hop of another place, was ever cho&s;en Pope of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but one &s;till that was either a Prie&s;t or a Deacon of the &s;aid Roman Church; &amp; the rea&s;on thereof it may be was, becau&s;e the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Rome</HI> would have none elected but one of their owne number: the fir&s;t that was otherwi&s;e elected was <HI>Formo&s;us</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Porto,</HI> in the eight hundred nintie and one: whereupon aro&s;e many uproares for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the antient Cu&s;tome, as may be &s;een in <HI>Pla|tina.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd, that a Citty being once po&s;&s;e&s;t by the enemy, the Bi&s;hop thereof was admitted into &s;ome other Bi&s;hoprick that was void, with condition, that upon re&s;titution to his owne Church, he &s;hould returne to his flock, and be called the</P>
<PB N="109" REF="60">
<P>Prie&s;t or Bi&s;hop of that place, which had been committed unto him: as if <HI>Fundi</HI> had been taken by the Turks, thus it would be &s;aid, <HI>Petrus Epi&s;copus Fundanus et Sacerdos, Cardinalis Ferracinen&s;.</HI> If &s;o be the charge of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Ferracina</HI> had been conferred on him, as appears in Saint <HI>Gre|gory,</HI> where there are foure or five exam|ples of it.</P>
<P>The third, that in the con&s;ecration of the Pope, there were deputed &s;even Bi|&s;hops, namely, <HI>Albanus, Ostien&s;is, Portuen|&s;is, Sanctae Rufinae, Tu&s;culanus, Prene&s;tinus, Sabinen&s;is:</HI> And the&s;e in the beginning did not intervene in the Election, but only in the con&s;ecration.</P>
<P>Foure hundred years after, or there a|bout, in the time of <HI>Alexander</HI> the third, they were admitted to the Election, and then they began to be called Bi&s;hops Car|dinalls, like unto the Prie&s;ts and Deacons Cardinalls, which intervened in the Ele|ction of the Pope: but before that, there was never any called Bi&s;hop Cardinall.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="110" REF="61">
<HEAD>Of the Cardinals Titles.</HEAD>
<P>THe Titles of Prie&s;ts-Cardinalls, were of a determinate number, that is, eight and twenty, as tho&s;e of the Deacons eighteen, and tho&s;e of the Bi&s;hops &s;even. Now in Rome there were five Churches built, which were called Patriarchall; that is, Saint <HI>John de Lateran,</HI> repre&s;enting the Pope: Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> repre&s;enting the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> that of <HI>Alexandria, Sancta Maria magiore,</HI> that of <HI>Antiochia,</HI> and Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> without the Walls, that of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>To the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Lateran</HI> (for that it was the Cathedrall) were deputed the &s;even Bi&s;hops Cardinalls, to that of the others (becau&s;e they were of le&s;&s;e dignity) &s;even Prie&s;ts Cardinalls for each of them; and this number was &s;etled for twelve hundred years, untill the time of <HI>Innocent</HI> the &s;econd; before whom, Cardinalls were not made many together, but one by one as they came to be void.</P>
<P><HI>Innocent</HI> the &s;econd, finding divers Car|dinall&s;hips void, began fir&s;t to make many Cardinalls together, which was continued untill about four hundred years &s;ince; at
<PB N="111" REF="61"> which time the number of Cardinalls &s;eeming to be too great, they began when Cardinalls dyed, not to put others in their roomes, but to give them in <HI>commen|dum</HI> to other Cardinals or leave the Go|vernment of them to the Cardinalls Arch|prie&s;ts; &s;o that in proce&s;&s;e of time it came to that pa&s;&s;e, as no longer minding the antient number of fifty three, they grew to be exceedingly dimini&s;hed: howbeit, Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, not only re&s;tored them to the &s;aid number again, but it was by him, and Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third, and Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth exceeded, in&s;omuch that the eight and twenty titles of the Prie&s;ts Cardinalls not &s;ufficing, Pope <HI>Leo</HI> made thirteen, Pope <HI>Iulian</HI> the third, three, and Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fourth one more: Now it is to be noted, that before Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> they never exceeded the number of fifty and three.</P>
<P>It was an antient cu&s;tome ob&s;erved in the Church, for fourteen hundred yeers together, that no oppo&s;ition was among&s;t the Cardinalls; for a Deacon made not him&s;elfe a Prie&s;t, unle&s;&s;e he lo&s;t his Dea|con&s;hip, and then took upon him the title of Prie&s;t; and in like &s;ort, if a Prie&s;t became a Bi&s;hop, he left the title of Prie&s;t,
<PB N="102" REF="62"> but continuing a Prie&s;t he never changed his title, neither a Bi&s;hop his Bi&s;hoprick, nor a Deacon his Deacon&s;hip.</P>
<P>One of tho&s;e actions &s;prang from the Schi&s;me of the Councell of <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> where the Cardinall yeelding to the one and the o|ther obedience, &s;ome Cardinals of <HI>Avigni|on</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> being of the &s;ame Cardinall|&s;hip, it was nece&s;&s;ary that one of them &s;hould relinqui&s;h his, and for this they be|gan afterwards to change, which hath been the ruine of the Churches, where there were Titles of Deacon&s;hips.</P>
<P>It was an ancient cu&s;tome likewi&s;e, which la&s;ted five hundred yeares, even to the time of Pope <HI>Sixtus quartus,</HI> that a Dea|con &s;hould have no title, nor a Prie&s;t a Deacon&s;hip, it being a thing repugnant to give the cure of &s;oules to a Deacon, and to a Prie&s;t a Deacon&s;hip.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Sixtus quartus</HI> was the fir&s;t that confounded this Cardinal&s;hip, giving to Prie&s;ts Deacon&s;hips, &amp; titles to Deacons; and the matter went &s;o farre forward, that there is not a title, which hath not had a Deacon: wherein yet is to be noted, that the Deacon, although he hath a title, as the Cardinall <HI>Montallo</HI> had of <HI>San Loren&s;o in Doma&s;o,</HI> yet hee u&s;eth not the name of
<PB N="113" REF="62"> title, as to &s;ay, <HI>Alexander Sancti Laurentii, &amp; Dama&s;o Diaconus Cardinalis,</HI> without men|tion of the title: and contrarily the Prie&s;t Cardinall, that hath a Deacon&s;hip, where|as he ought to &s;peake of the title, not be|cau&s;e it hath no title, yet he adjoynes it, as <HI>Jacobus Sabellus</HI> of the title, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Of the habit of the Cardinalls.</HEAD>
<P>THe Cardinals, before <HI>Innocent</HI> the fourth, untill the yeare a thou&s;and, two hundred and fifty, went in the ordi|nary habit of a Prie&s;t, like to that of the Monks. <HI>Innocent</HI> the fourth fir&s;t of all ad|ded to it the red Hatt; afterwards, in the time of <HI>Boniface</HI> the ninth, they had the red and violet habit, in the &s;ame manner and forme as it is u&s;ed at this day. Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the &s;econd gave the Myter of &s;ilke, the red cap, the red cloth for the Mule, and guilt &s;tirrops. <HI>Gregory</HI> the fourteenth gave the red cap to the Regular Cardinalls, going otherwaies apparelled in that colour, which tho&s;e of the order, whereof they were then u&s;ed, but of the &s;ame fa&s;hion and &s;tuffe as the other Cardinals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> howbeit they wore no Roche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="114" REF="63"> &s;ock of cloth; and when they adorne them&s;elves, in&s;tead of a Rochet they put on a coate with wide &s;leeves, and adorne them&s;elves over that; the other Cardi|nalls, which are not Regulars, put on the <HI>Ammitts</HI> over the Rochet, which they weare ordinarily, &amp; then their ornaments; in like manner the Regular Cardinal ought to put on the <HI>Ammitt</HI> over the Coat. The &s;haven Crowne is the common badge of all the Clergy men; the Manipule is the badge of the Subdeacon; the cro&s;&s;e-Stole of the Deacon; the Planeta of the Prie&s;t; the Myter of the Bi&s;hop; the Pall of the Arch|bi&s;hop, of the Primate, &amp; of the Patriarch; and the Diadem of the Pope, which for &s;ixe hundred yeares together was adorned with onely one Crowne, but at the returne of the Apo&s;tolick Sea from <HI>Avignion</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> the Popes began to weare the triple Crowne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Creation of the Cardinalls.</HEAD>
<P>THe Pope doth u&s;e to make Cardi|nalls two &s;everall waies; the fir&s;t is this: Tho&s;e per&s;ons which are abiding in <HI>Rome,</HI> whom his Holine&s;&s;e purpo&s;eth to
<PB N="115" REF="63"> promote, have notice given them thereof over night by the Cardinall Nephewes, whereupon the next morning they repaire to the Palace at the u&s;uall houre.</P>
<P>The Pope, when as the &s;ecret Con&s;i&s;tory is &s;hut up, pronunceth the Cardinalls, whom he intends to make; and in the &s;ame Con&s;i&s;tory cau&s;es them to bee called in, where kneeling downe at his Holines feet, the Pope puts the red hatt on his head, and making the &s;igne of the Cro&s;&s;e on it, hee &s;ayes to him, <HI>E&s;to Cardinalis,</HI> and weare this red hatt, as a &s;igne, that thou wilt without feare expo&s;e thy &s;elf even to death, and the effu&s;ion of thy deare&s;t bloud, for the exalta|tion of the holy faith, for the peace &amp; qui|et of Chri&s;tian people, and augmenting the &s;tate of the holy Roman Church; in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then the new Car|dinall takes off the Hatt from his head, and ki&s;&s;eth his Holine&s;&s;e feet.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way is this. In the &s;ecret Con&s;i&s;tory the Pope pronounceth in order of dignitie the Cardinalls which he hath made, and then gives a li&s;t of them to the Cardinall Nephew, who &s;ends his Ma&s;ter of the Chamber with his owne Coach to fetch tho&s;e per&s;ons which are promoted,
<PB N="116" REF="64"> from out of &s;uch parts of the City as they live in, and bring them to his Eminencies Lodgings. There they have their Crowns &s;haven, and are attyred in purple like Cardinalls; the garments wherewith they were apparrelled before are the vailes of the Cardinall Nephewes adjutants of the Chamber; and the Cardinall Nephewes Barber that &s;haved their crownes receives from them five and twenty duckets for his fee. After dinner the &s;ame Cardinall ha|ving fea&s;ted the new Cardinalls, conducts them to his Holine&s;&s;e, before who&s;e feet kneeling on their knees they have the red hatt put upon their heads in the manner before declared; and after many words of humility, and thanks, they depart away: and &s;o goe all in the habit of a Cardinall together to vi&s;it his Holine&s;&s;e kinsfolks, a&s;|well men as women continuing afterwards in their hou&s;es untill the publique Con&s;i|&s;tory, alwaies cloathed in purple till the day of the &s;aid Con&s;i&s;tory, though it bee <HI>extra tempora,</HI> and giving audience to every one that comes to vi&s;it them. Now all the time before the publique Con&s;i&s;tory the new Cardinall ought not to accompany any one, and if he does &s;o, he does ill; for al|beit Cardinalls come to vi&s;it him, he can|not,
<PB N="117" REF="64"> nor ought not to accompany them farther then the Chamber doore, where hee received the vi&s;it: But the ancient good rule was, that the Cardinalls did not vi&s;it the new. Cardinalls before the pub|lique Con&s;i&s;tory; and if they chanced to doe it, by occa&s;ion of kindred, as other|waies, they went to them by night, and were not &s;eene.</P>

<HEAD>Of tho&s;e that are made Cardinalls being ab&s;ent from <HI>Rome.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE, who in his Holine&s;&s;e name is adver|ti&s;ed, that he is created a Cardinall, mu&s;t pre&s;ently cau&s;e a &s;haven Crowne to be made him, and him&s;elfe as a Car|dinall, but in purple; for hee may not u&s;e red, untill he have received the hatt &s;ent unto him by the Pope: and from that time he is to be called Cardinall, and &s;o he may &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>The red hatt is alwaies carried by one of the Popes Chamberlaines, accompanied with his Holine&s;&s;e <HI>Brieve,</HI> for which the new Cardinall payes an hundred duckets to the Chamber. Now the ceremonie of conferring the hatt upon him, is perfor|med,
<PB N="118" REF="65"> where there is no <HI>Nuntio</HI> by the Em|peror, the King, the Arch-Bi&s;hop, or Bi|&s;hop of the place.</P>
<P>The newes of the Cardinal&s;hip, before the Hat is brought, together with the Popes, or one of his Nephews letters, is carried by a Currier, unto whom a good reward is given, as al&s;o to the Chamber|laine that brings the Hat, there is a great reward al&s;o given, which u&s;ually, from them who are pre&s;ent in <HI>Rome</HI> at their pro|motion, is at lea&s;t five hundred Duckats, and from them which receive the Hat out of <HI>Rome,</HI> a thou&s;and Duckats, with three hundred more at the publick con&s;i&s;tory, when they are confirmed in their Dignity; which reward is divided among&s;t the &s;e|cret participant Chamberlaines; and to the Chamberlain that carried the Hat, belongs an equall &s;hare, although he be none of the participants. Of the rewards given to the Currier are three parts made, one to the Cardinall Nephews &s;ecretary, one to the Ma&s;ter Generall of the Po&s;ts, and the third to the Currier him&s;elfe, the expence of the voyage being fir&s;t deduct|ed out of it.</P>
<P>The Cardinall which goes to <HI>Rome</HI> to take the Hatt, is to goe in the travelling
<PB N="119" REF="65"> habit of a Cardinall, but of purple colour, and on his head an ordinary hatt, with a Gold band, and faced with red &s;ilk: being arrived at <HI>Rome</HI> he will be mett with the Caroches, which the Cardinalls &s;end, and in particular with the Cardinal Nephews, wherein he &s;hall be conducted to the Apo|&s;tolicall Palace, &amp; being come to the &s;aid Cardinall Nephews Lodgings, he mu&s;t complement with his eminencie, and then by his Barber, he mu&s;t have the Cardinals &s;haven crowne made on his head, and putting off his travelling habit, he mu&s;t put on a long Robe with a Rochet, and &s;o he mu&s;t be conducted by his Eminency to the Pope, upon the &s;ight of whom, the new Cardinall mu&s;t kneel down before him, and then after other bowings of him|&s;elfe; he mu&s;t goe and ki&s;s his Holine&s;&s;e feet, and hand; that done, having been admitted <HI>ad o&s;culum,</HI> u&s;ed many words of thankfulne&s;&s;e for the dignity of a Cardi|nall conferred on him, and taken leave of his Holine&s;&s;e, he mu&s;t accompany the Cardinall Nephew to his lodgings, where he mu&s;t complement him anew, and from thence he mu&s;t goe and vi&s;it the Popes Kinsfolks, who mo&s;t commonly dwell in places remote from his Palace.</P>
<PB N="120" REF="66">
<P>Having performed all this, he mu&s;t re|paire to his owne hou&s;e, out of which he may not &s;tir untill his Holine&s;&s;e give him a publick Con&s;i&s;tory; howbeit, he may in the mean time receive vi&s;its, but privately without going forth of his Chamber, and without accompanying the vi&s;itors, let them be what they will, as is delivered before.</P>
<P>On the day of the publick Con&s;i&s;tory, the accu&s;tomed pompe of the &s;olemne riding is u&s;ed, and the new Cardinall, if he be an Arch-Bi&s;hop or Bi&s;hop, wears on his head a black Pontificall hatt, faced with Green; but if he were before only a Prie&s;t, a Prelate, or of the &s;hort robe, he mu&s;t wear a hat in the &s;ame manner, but faced with black, and mu&s;t go attired in red, if the day doe permit it; and his cloake mu&s;t be of raterd Grogeram, being accompanied with all the Cardinalls, and &s;o he goes to receive the red Hat from the hands of his Holine&s;&s;e: In which &s;olemni|ties many ceremonies occurre, but one cannot erre therein, becau&s;e all is guided by the Ma&s;ters of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, the Popes Cardinall Nephew fea&s;ts the new Cardinall; he is afterwards to vi&s;it the whole &s;acred Col|ledge
<PB N="121" REF="66"> with all his traine, and in his habit, begining at the Deacon Cardinall, and then the re&s;t one after another, without order: and in the &s;ame habit he is to re|ceive, and render the vi&s;its of, and to the Amba&s;&s;adors of Kings, and Princes, and o|ther great per&s;onages.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;ecret Con&s;i&s;tory, after the publick Con&s;i&s;tory, the Pope performes the ceremony of &s;hutting up the new Cardinalls mouth, his Holine&s;&s;e &s;peaking and praying, and the new Cardinall not &s;aying a word. This &s;hutting up of the mouth, deprives the new Cardinall of his active and pa&s;&s;ive voice.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Con&s;i&s;tory, his Holine&s;&s;e opens his mouth, declares his title unto him, and e&s;pou&s;es him with a Gold Ring, that hath a Saphire &s;et in it, for which in times pa&s;t, the Cardinals heir (in ca&s;e he dyed) paid five hundred duckats in the Chamber: Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth gave this fee of the Ring to the German Colledge of <HI>Rome,</HI> but afterwards Pope <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> took it from thence, and by <HI>Gregory</HI> the fifteenth, it was a&s;&s;igned to the &s;acred Colledge <HI>de propaganda fide,</HI> and it was by a Pontificall Bull ordained, that it &s;hould be alwaies done by every Car|dinall
<PB N="122" REF="67"> from the very day of his promoti|on.</P>
<P>Any one that &s;hall be made a Cardinall, and before his coming to <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hall be de|clared a Legat; he may exerci&s;e his Legat|&s;hip, if his Holine&s;&s;e plea&s;ure be not o|therwi&s;e, untill he hath fir&s;t the Hat; and in that ca&s;e the Pope u&s;eth to &s;end it unto him with a <HI>Brieve:</HI> afterwards when that Legation is fini&s;hed, and that the &s;ame Cardinall comes to <HI>Rome,</HI> he is at any hand to have a publique Con&s;i&s;tory granted to him, together with the wonted &s;olemn riding. Every Cardinall hath the Hatt, which his Holine&s;&s;e puts on his head, brought home to him to his hou&s;e by a &s;ecret Chamberlain, in a &s;ilver and gilt Ba&s;on, that is carried by the Popes cup|bord-keeper, unto whom is u&s;ed to be given a reward of five and twenty crowns of Gold.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the new Cardinall is to give the rewards which are mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P>Every Cardinall pa&s;&s;eth the Bull of his Cardinal&s;hip, which being &s;ub&s;cribed by the Pope, and all the Cardinals pre&s;ent in <HI>Rome,</HI> the u&s;uall &s;eale of lead is put to it, and &s;ometimes one of Gold.</P>

Now this is the order which is ob&s;erved with a per&s;on that is de&s;tinated to a Church: he mu&s;t go to his examinati|on before his Holine&s;&s;e, where he mu&s;t be all the while upon his knees, kneeling on a Cu&s;hion: If he doth not carry him|&s;elfe well, he is rejected; if he doth carry

The care of making and keep|ing the Palls appertaines to the Apo&s;to|licall Subdeacons, who make them of pure and white wooll in this manner. The Nunnes of Saint <HI>Annes</HI> Mona&s;tery do offer every yeare two white Lambes on the Al|tar of that Church in the Fe&s;tivall day of Saint <HI>Anne,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Agnus Dei</HI> is &s;inging in &s;olemne Ma&s;&s;e. Now tho&s;e two lambes are delivered to the Canons of the La|teranens Churches, and are afterwards con&s;igned by them to the Apo&s;tolicall Subdeacons, who put them to feede in certaine pa&s;tures, untill the time of &s;hea|ring them be come: then they &s;heare off their wooll, and mixing it with other like pure and white wooll, they &s;pin it into yarne, wherewith the Palls are woven three fingers broad into an orbicular form, &s;o as it may compa&s;&s;e the Archbi&s;hops &s;houlders: The Pall hath a kind of labell hanging down before to the bre&s;t, and two

The Palls being made after this &s;ort by the Subdeacons, they are carried to the Cathedrall Church of the Prince of the Apo&s;tles, and by the Ca|nons thereof are laid upon the bodies of the Apo&s;tles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> under the high Altar, where being watched one night, according to the wonted cu&s;tome, they are taken from thence, and re&s;tored againe to the Subdeacons, who carefully keep them in a convenient and decent place. The u&s;e of the Pall, &s;o far as we can finde, is very ancient, and had its originall from Pope <HI>Linus,</HI> the immediate Succe&s;&s;or of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter;</HI> for &s;o we reade writ|ten by Bi&s;hop <HI>Maximus</HI> in an Homilie of the Sacerdotall ve&s;ture, who there &s;aith, our Patriarkes doe hold that our Ephod (namely the Pall) was in&s;tituted by <HI>Linus,</HI> the &s;econd Roman Bi&s;hop after <HI>Peter,</HI> and given by God to our Prelates for a &s;ingular and &s;peciall priviledge of power.

The Pope ha|ving commanded the Advocate forth, re|quireth the opinion of the Fathers, whe|ther the Pall &s;hall be given accordingly, or no: Then he committs to the chiefe Dea|con-Cardinall the con&s;igning of the Pall to the &s;aid Prelate, or his Proctor; where|upon the &s;aid Cardinall appoints the place and day, where, and when the Pall &s;hall be con&s;igned, which for the mo&s;t part is in the Chappell of the &s;aid Cardinalls hou&s;e, but &s;ometimes in Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church at the high Altar.

<P>FOra&s;much as we have mentioned the publick Con&s;i&s;tory, and may do &s;o a|gain hereafter, we have thought meet to explain the order and manner of the &s;ame. In the Apo&s;tolicall Palace there are two
<PB N="147" REF="79"> Pontificall Halls, which are contained in the Conclave, the greate&s;t of them is u&s;ed to be furni&s;hed, and made ready for the publick Con&s;i&s;tory, when as either Kings or their Amba&s;&s;adors are to be received, and the Canonization of a Saint is to be celebrated. In the other hall, are the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of Princes, &amp; common-wealths, when they come to yield obedience to the Pope, received; as al&s;o the Apo&s;tolicall Legats, returning from their Legations, and new Cardinalls coming to the Roman Court: In it too are the new Cardinals publi&s;hed, and all cau&s;es handled which require a publick Con&s;i&s;tory. At the upper end of the Hall, is a Pontificall Throne erected, with an a&s;cent of three ample &s;teps unto it, the forme of the Throne is almo&s;t foure-&s;quare, and about twelve hand-breadths broad, in the mid&s;t where|of is a &s;eat joyning to the Wall, with a great and little foot-&s;toole; all the floor of the Throne is covered with Scarlet cloth, and &s;o is the great foot&s;tool, but the Wall is adorned with cloth of Gold, and likwi&s;e the &s;eat, over which hangs a cloth of State of the &s;ame &s;tuffe; on the right hand within the Throne are the &s;eats of the Bi&s;hops, and Prie&s;ts Cardinalls, two

<P>THe &s;ecret Con&s;i&s;tory is held in &s;ome remoter roome of the Apo&s;tolicall Palace, at this day called the Papall Cham|ber; where in the mid&s;t of it is a Pontifi|call &s;eate erected again&s;t the wall, which is rai&s;ed from the ground without &s;teps or degrees; and hath a great foot&s;toole, on which the the Pope &s;etts his feet, and ano|ther litle one, whereby one may a&s;cend higher. The Cardinals &s;eats are placed be|fore the Pope, on the right, &amp; left hand, eve|ryone in its order. The Popes &s;eate is ador|ned with cloth of gold; the Cardinalls &s;eates are bare, but painted red with his Holine&s;&s;e Armes upon them. The place between the Popes &s;eate and the Cardinals is u&s;ually covered with tape&s;try. The ju|nior Deacon Cardinall hath a little bell by him, wherewith hee gives notice to the Keepers of the Con&s;i&s;tory, if the Pope or Fathers will have them to doe any thing. In the &s;pace between the Cardinalls &s;eates are two formes placed round at a pretty di|&s;tance the one from the other, untill all are come in, &s;o that the Cardinals may betwixt

<HEAD>Of the Conclave.</HEAD>
<P>THe place of the Conclave (for &s;o is that called at this day wherein the Fathers are &s;hutt up for election of the Pope) is in the Apo&s;tolicall Palace; and it containes two Halls, and Chappells, with &s;ome other roomes, and hou&s;es of Office: all which are &s;o clo&s;ed up with a wall that one can &s;ee no windowes, but what are ve|ry high, tho&s;e only excepted by which you
<PB N="153" REF="82"> pa&s;&s;e unto the Chappells, and &s;econd Hall. The Halls are for the Cardinalls to walke in, and recreate them&s;elves in, when they are not imployed in the Election; the other roomes are for the u&s;e of &s;uch, as are al&s;o &s;hutt up with the Cardinalls in the Conclave. The gate at the entrance into the fir&s;t Hall hath a wicket in it, through which the Cardinalls dyet is brought in unto them; and the &s;aid gate and wicket are made &s;afe with &s;trong iron barrs, and foure locks. In the le&s;&s;er Chappell the Fa|thers meete to celebrate Divine Service, and to make the election. In the greater Chappell are &s;o many Cells made, as there be Cardinalls voting in election; which are di&s;tant about a foot one from another, and are not &s;eparated a&s;under by any wall, or &s;uch like matter, but by curtaines or thin cloth, which hang upon rafters &s;et up all along in a decent manner for that purpo&s;e. Now the&s;e Cells all are marked with the letters of the Alphabet, and on the day be|fore the Cardinals enter into the conclave, and are &s;everally a&s;&s;igned to each of them; not by order, but by lott: and then doe their &s;ervants in that interim make provi|&s;ion of curtaines, beds, and other furniture for them. The Conclave being thus pre|pared,
<PB N="154" REF="83"> e&s;peciall order is taken that none may goe, &s;tand, or abide above, below, or on any of the &s;ides of the Conclave, nor that any may &s;ee, &s;peak, or any way &s;end, or ca&s;t any thing unto them that are &s;hut up in it, le&s;t thereby any might be enabled to &s;earch into their Coun&s;ells by voice, &s;igne, &s;ound, or any other device. More|over there are foure guards of the further Conclave appointed: the guard of the fir&s;t gate of the Palace is committed to &s;ome great Prelate, or Nobleman, who with two or three hundred &s;ouldiers, is to guard the Palace and the Fathers night and day. The &s;econd guard is within the fir&s;t gate, as one goes up unto the Conclave, and is under the charge of the Con&s;ervators, and <HI>Caporioni</HI> of the Citty of <HI>Rome.</HI> The third guard is a little higher at the &s;econd gate, and is intru&s;ted to a &s;elect number of noble per&s;onages. The fourth and la&s;t guard is at the immediat entrance into the Conclave, and is in the hands of &s;even or eight of the worthie&s;t Bi&s;hops of the Ro|man Court. The guard of the fir&s;t gate of the Palace is &s;etled a&s;&s;oon as the Pope is dead, but &s;o are not the others untill the Cardinalls enter into the Conclave. The gate and wicket at the entrance into the
<PB N="155" REF="83"> fir&s;t Hall is, as I have &s;aid before, made fa&s;t with four locks, one to the out&s;ide of the gate, and one on the out&s;ide of the wicket; al&s;o one on the in&s;ide of the gate, and one on the in&s;ide of the wicket: the two keys of the locks on the out&s;ide of the gate and wicket are kept by the guard of that place, the other two keys of the locks on the in|&s;ide of the gate and wicket, are in the cu|&s;tody of the Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies, &s;o that neither the Gate nor the wicket can be opened without the con&s;ent both of them that are within and without.</P>

<P>ALbeit the Roman high Bi&s;hop doth excell all mortall men in dignity and authority, and is able to bind and loo&s;e all things on earth, yet cannot he avoid the extreame nece&s;&s;ity of Fate; for the di&s;ciple is not above his Ma&s;ter, nor the &s;ervant greater then his Lord God did not &s;pare his only begotten &s;onne, but would have him dye, that he might deliver man from Eternall Death, to the end all may know, that none is exempted from cor|porall death: The Pope is to think, that though he be the highe&s;t of all, yet he is mortall, and ought carefully to beare in mind that Ceremony of the blaze which is u&s;ed among&s;t other &s;olemnities of his Coronation: Holy Father, thus pa&s;&s;eth away the glory of the world; all fle&s;h is gra&s;&s;e, and the beauty thereof as the flower of the field. Wherefore he &s;hould accordingly be alwaies prepared, as a good Pa&s;tor and a diligent Steward, to render an account of his &s;teward&s;hip unto his Lord, de&s;iring to be di&s;&s;olved, and to be
<PB N="192" REF="103"> with Chri&s;t, and carefully endeavour to performe with prai&s;e that la&s;t act, where|with the elect are wont to be Crowned. Now if the Pope doth not know whil&s;t he is &s;ick the danger of his di&s;ea&s;e, the Phy|&s;itians that are about him, a&s;&s;oon as they are in doubt of him, do exhort him pri|vatly with prudent words to doe all that is behoofefull for the good of his &s;oule, promi&s;ing in the mean time not to be wan|ting in any thing that may conduce to the recovering of his health; after which they acquaint the Popes Confe&s;&s;or with the &s;tate of hs body, who more plainly, yet &s;ecretly, and with much reverence and charitie, declares unto his Holine&s;&s;e the perill he is in, admoni&s;hing him to &s;ub|mit him&s;elfe unto the plea&s;ure of the Al|mighty; and con&s;idering what place he doth hold to direct other Princes by his words and example in the way of Salvati|on. The Pope of his owne accord, which is be&s;t, or incited by the &s;aid admonitions, taking notice of the approach of his la&s;t day, fir&s;t of all devoutly confe&s;&s;eth him|&s;elfe of all his &s;innes to his gho&s;tly Father, and de&s;ires a full ab&s;olution of them from him; then in a convenient time he com|mands all his dome&s;ticall Prelates, and
<PB N="193" REF="103"> the chiefe of his family to be convented before him, in who&s;e pre&s;ence, and of that of the Holy Sacrament of Chri&s;ts body, he makes an open confe&s;&s;ion of his faith, which he affirmeth he hath ever con&s;tantly held, and therein will by Gods grace live and dye. Afterwards he prayeth them all to forgive him, if by chance he hath unju&s;tly offended any one, be&s;tows &s;ome &s;pirituall graces on them, and de|&s;iring them to pray for his &s;oule, he re|quires of the Ve&s;try-keeper, or of &s;ome o|ther Prelates, that he may receive the Sa|cred <HI>Viaticum;</HI> and that when it &s;hall &s;eem &s;ea&s;onable unto them, they will admini|&s;ter the other &s;acraments of the Church unto him. This done, whil&s;t he is in good and perfect memory, he &s;ends for the &s;a|cred Senate of the Cardinals, before whom he againe makes confe&s;&s;ion of his faith, craves pardon if in his government he hath offended any of them, intreats them to pray for his &s;oule, commends the Church of God to them, exhorts them to be diligent, and unanimous in the election of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and to chu&s;e &s;uch an one, as might feed the flock of Chri&s;t more a|bundantly, then he could doe, naming, if he thinks good, one, or more, whom in
<PB N="194" REF="104"> his judgment he holds to be mo&s;t fit: He al&s;o opens unto them his debts, and what is owing to him; manife&s;ts likwi&s;e unto them his writings, monies, and Jewels, makes his Will, and appoints the place of his buriall: Furthermore he recommends unto them his family, and retainers, and conferring on them &s;uch &s;pirituall graces, as they de&s;ire of him, he di&s;mi&s;&s;eth them with his ble&s;&s;ing. Hereupon the Cardinals perceiving the Pope to be drawing to his end, elect three of the Colledge, namely, one of every order, who together with the Chamberlain, take an inventory of all the goods that are in the Apo&s;tolicall Palace, and put them up in a &s;afe place under good cu&s;tody: they look over all that is in the Lord Ve&s;try-keepers charge, continuing it &s;till in his hands, becau&s;e he is a perpetuall Officer: The Colledge of Cardinals do al&s;o take care that no tumult may ari&s;e in the Citty, if the Pope doth die there, prudently, and in time intro|ducing the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall Militia, which they di&s;po&s;e of in the mo&s;t opportune pla|ces of the citty: They likewi&s;e provide for the provinces of the Church, &s;ending grave and wi&s;e men Commi&s;&s;aries unto them.

All this performed, the Penitentiaries put on him his ordinary Clothes, and over them &s;uch his &s;acred ve&s;tments as he was u&s;ed to celebrate Ma&s;&s;e with, and in that man|ner lay him on a Bier covered with cloth of gold, having the Popes and the Churches armes hanging upon it: under his head they put a pillow of cloth of gold, and at his feet they put two other

The Corps is thus adorned in the Popes privie Chamber, where if his Holine&s;&s;e dyed in the night, it is kept un|till the next day by the penitentiaries, watching and &s;inging all the while a|bout it: Morning come, the Corps is carried by the Penitentiaries at a conve|nient time to the great Chappell, the Subdeacon going before it with the Cro&s;&s;e; as al&s;o the Gentlemen of the Chappell, &s;inging <HI>Subvenite,</HI> together with fifty or three-&s;core burning torches, borne by the decea&s;ed Popes equires, and all the whole family following after.

That done, the decea&s;ed Pope is carried with many torches before him, and the whole following after him, to St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church, and placed in the mid&s;t of it, where he re|maines two or three dayes, to the end the people may vi&s;it him, and ki&s;&s;e his hand: Then is he returned back to the great

<P><HI>_MAny ages are pa&s;t (&s;aith Saint</HI> Je|rome, ad Laetam de in&s;tit. fil.) <HI>&s;ince of the old</HI> Rome <HI>there hath no longer been &s;een the beauty of the Forum, the excellencie of the Temple of</HI> Tarpei|an Jove, <HI>the magnificence of the</HI> Thermae, <HI>or Baths built in the forme of provinces, the riches of the</HI> Pantheor; <HI>and of infinite other edifices, at the &s;ight where of</HI> Ammianus Marcellinus <HI>&s;tood amazed: and after the time of St.</HI> Jerome, <HI>the Citty of the Roman Gentles changed face in &s;uch &s;ort, as</HI> Fuligines <HI>&s;aith,</HI> et arenarum telis omnia Romae Templa cooperta &s;unt: mo|vetur urbs &s;edibus &s;uis. <HI>But now it is &s;o &s;trangely renued, that we cannot know what we read thereof in antient writters. It changed face I &s;ay in St.</HI> Jeromes <HI>age, at &s;uch time as</HI> mun|danus populus ante delubra &s;emiruta ad
<PB REF="109"> Martyrum tumulos currebat. <HI>And after the cruell &s;pectacle of the killing of the Citizens for the faith of Chri&s;t, it was purged from Idolatrous blood; and impietie and gentili&s;me being at one time extingui&s;hed, trophees were every where e|rected to the preaching of the holy Apostles</HI> Pe|ter <HI>and</HI> Paul. <HI>Finally the Empire of</HI> Rome <HI>was renovated with a &s;trange Metamorpho&s;is, and made, as</HI> Rupertus <HI>the Abbot &s;aith</HI> lib. 3. cap. 2. de Divin offic. Caput mundi, Domini Chri&s;ti Regis aeterni vehiculum, et habi|taculum currus atque Thronum. <HI>Yet were not the antient Temples for all that taken away, but the &s;uperstitions were converted to Godly, and the wicked and impure to cha&s;t and religi|ous u&s;es; yea the very Baths and Theaters were all &s;anctified: But the&s;e too afterwards became the prey of the Barbarians, and of time; &s;o that di|&s;poiled of their pretious ornaments, and in part destroyed, they remained deformed reliques, al|together un&s;ufficient to excite in any the marvaile of the antient magnificence. At last the new City ro&s;e up again, with Palaces, Churches, Gardens, Pyramides, Columns, and other fabricks, no le&s;&s;e to be regarded then the antient: There wants not in it an infinite number of Marbles, and other stones of great price; exqui&s;ite Mo&s;aique works, excellent Pictures, and rare statues, and &s;epul|chers:
<PB REF="109"> In it al&s;o are noble Libraries, and Ho&s;pi|tals for all infirmities, and nations; be&s;ides Col|ledges and &s;eminaries for youth, with large and &s;pacious hou&s;es for the receiving and relieving of Orphans, and Children, both of the one and the other &s;ex, that are abandoned and left to the wide world: It is likewi&s;e repleni&s;hed with con|vents of Fryars, Mona&s;teries of Nunnes, and O|ratories of laymen, who exerci&s;e them&s;elves con|tinually in the works of pietie, charitie, and de|votion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pa&s;&s;ing then oftentimes up and down this Cit|ty, either for recreation, or devotion, and dili|gently ob&s;erving it on every part, illu&s;trated with many famous antiquities, modern rarities, and &s;uperbe-edifices, which for their multitude can not without danger of the truth be trusted to the me|mory of the &s;pectator, I re&s;olved to note all briefly with that order, which &s;eemed to me mo&s;t ea&s;ie for the convenient viewing of them. Having done &s;o then, and &s;hewed it to my friends, they judged it to be very nece&s;&s;ary for the travelling &s;trangers, who roaming many times intricately thorough</HI> Rome, <HI>part from it afterwards confounded with the magnificence of a Chaos, and not &s;atisfied in their de&s;ires: wherefore I thought fit to publi&s;h it for their better accommodation and benefit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now it may be &s;ome of them will complaine,
<PB REF="110"> that I guide them with too Laconick a di&s;cour&s;e for the under&s;tanding of that which is to be &s;een; but beleeve me if they would be informed of the be|ginnings, augmentations, and qualitie, of all the Temples, Palaces, Gardens, Piatzaes, Statues, Pictures, Ho&s;pitals, Colledges, Fraternities, Mo|na&s;teries, and other things of the Citty, many bookes would be required for the contenting of their Curio&s;ity: But my intent only is to &s;ignifie &s;o much briefly as will be &s;ufficient for the &s;peed of a &s;trangers travell, who if he can have time e|nough for it, he may arrive to the full knowledge of all the &s;acred and prophane antiquities of the Citty, with the study of certain Authors in print; of which that he may not be confounded with the multitude of them that have written thereof, I will quote &s;ome few that will very well &s;erve to give him &s;ati&s;faction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let the travelling &s;tranger then furni&s;h him|&s;elfe with</HI> Andrea Fulvio, de Pale&s;trina, <HI>who wrote in latin, and was tran&s;lated into Ita|lian by</HI> Paolo del Ro&s;&s;o, <HI>in the year 1543. and newly printed by</HI> Franzini <HI>in</HI> Venice 1588. <HI>with figures, and the Annotations of</HI> Giralomo Fernucci.</P>

<P><HI>All the editions of</HI> Fauno, Lucio Mauro, <HI>and</HI> Bernardo Gamucci <HI>are good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of all the Churches of</HI> Rome Ottavio Pan|cirolo <HI>hath written, the Title of his book being</HI> Te&s;ori Ne&s;co&s;ti; <HI>and after him</HI> Pompilio Torto Stationer, <HI>under the name of</HI> Lodovi|co <HI>his &s;onne, who&s;e book is intituled,</HI> Ritratto di Roma moderna.</P>
<P><HI>Of all the pious works of</HI> Rome Camillo Fanucci <HI>hath written exceeding well.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of the Church-yards of</HI> Rome, Bo&s;io <HI>hath treated, but he did not fini&s;h the work. It was printed with the revi&s;all of</HI> Giovanni Severa|ni, <HI>and an edition of many figures; being intitu|led</HI> Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sotterranea.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Statues,</HI> Uly&s;&s;es Aldrovanda <HI>hath written, and</HI> France&s;co Perrior <HI>hath de&s;igned and cut an hundred of the mo&s;t famous Statues of</HI> Rome.</P>
<P><HI>Of the pictures which are in &s;ome Churches fronti&s;pices, and Palaces,</HI> Ga&s;paro Celio, <HI>and</HI> Giovanni Baglione <HI>have written.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The fea&s;ts which are daily celebrated in Church|es and other places of the Citty, he &s;hall finde printed in a &s;heet of paper, which is yeerly publi&s;h|ed, and intituled</HI> Diario Romano.</P>
<P><HI>Finally, though I am certain that I have not
<PB REF="111"> &s;et forth anything in this treati&s;e, which I have not read in &s;ome good Author, or &s;een with mine owne eys, or received from per&s;ons worthy of Credit, or establi&s;hed in the most common opinion of the World; yet doe I not for all that profe&s;&s;e to take from any one that is of more under&s;tanding, the liberty of holding that opinion which &s;hall &s;eem better unto him.</HI></P>

<P>In the forefront of the bridge you &s;hall di&s;cerne <HI>il Ca&s;tel Sant Angelo,</HI> who&s;e tower of Ma&s;&s;ie building was made in imitation of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> his <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> which &s;tood ju&s;t over again&s;t it on the other bank.
