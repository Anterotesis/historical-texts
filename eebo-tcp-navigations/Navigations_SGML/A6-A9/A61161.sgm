<P>I Here send You the <HI>Account,</HI> which <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere</HI> has gi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en of his <HI>Voyage</HI> into <HI>Eng|gland.</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
And though it be an insolent Libel on our Na|tion, yet I doubt not, but you will peruse it with de|light. For when you have beheld how many errors, and falshoods, he has com|mitted in this small Relati|on; you cannot but be well pleas'd to find, that who|ever undertakes to defame your Country, he must at the same time, forfeit his Wit, and his Understanding, as well as his good Manners.</P>
<P>The <HI>King of France</HI> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter"> already given him an effe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ctual
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Answer. And it be|came the justice of so great a Monarch, while he was de|fending the Interest of the Christian Faith with his arms, to punish a pragma|tical Reviler of one of the most powerful Kingdoms in Christendome: and while he was exacting satisfaction from the <HI>Pope</HI> himself, for an affront offer'd to his <HI>Em|bassador,</HI> to take care that none of his own Subjects should presume to injure the reputation of his neigh|bors, and neerest Allies.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">This just Reply which has been publiquely made to this rude Satyr, was the cause that it has not bin hi|therto confuted by an <HI>En|glish Gentleman</HI> of your ac|quaintance, who had under|taken it, whose Wit wee might have oppos'd against him, if he had still flourish't at <HI>Paris,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Historiographer Royal,</HI> though all his mighty boasts of his own abilities had been true. But however, though he is now below our excellent Friends consideration; yet
<PB N="5" REF="5">
I think my self ingag'd to see him corrected. For ha|ving now under my hands the <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Royal Soci|ety,</HI> it will be in vain for mee to try to represent its design to be advantageous to the glory of <HI>England,</HI> if my Countrymen shall know that one who calls himself a member of that <HI>Assembly,</HI> has escap'd unanswer'd in the publique disgraces, which he has cast on our whole <HI>Nation.</HI></P>
<P>I will therefore Sir, brief|ly take him into a calm ex|amination.
<PB N="6" REF="6">
And that you may understand how I in|tend to proceed with him, I do here in the beginning profess, that I will not vin|dicate the honor of the <HI>En|glish,</HI> by making reflexions on the <HI>French.</HI> I will not in|deavour to repair our own fame on the ruines of others. I will have no contention but with himself. I will only put together, and compare, the mistakes, the incoheren|ces, the vanities of his Book. And (to confess a secret to you, Sir,) I am resolv'd to
<PB N="7" REF="6">
take this course in answer|ing him; not only because I abhor the sordid way of Wit, of abusing whole Na|tions: but also because I am not much inamor'd of the glory of his punishment. For I cannot think that it is worth a mans while, that can live quietly here at <HI>Lon|don,</HI> to have the honour of making three or four ill-na|tur'd jests, on a whole King|dom, with the hazard of being justly bani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht into <HI>Flint</HI> or <HI>Denbigh</HI> for ones la|bour.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">I must confess Sir, I came at first to read him with some expectations. I had before seen what he had written in praise of those two great Men, the Ornaments of <HI>France, Gassendus,</HI> and <HI>De Marcu the Arch-Bishop of Pa|ris.</HI> And I had some good hope, that the familiarity, which he pretended to have had with them, had taught him some of their good Qualities: that from the first he had taken that can|dour, and modesty, which the world admires in his
<PB N="9" REF="7">
writings: and from the o|ther he had learn'd with what respect he ought to treat the fame of whole <HI>Na|tions, Churches,</HI> and <HI>Soveraign Princes,</HI> by that admirable defence, which he has made of the <HI>Gallican</HI> priviledges. Besides this, Sir, I took his Book into my hands with the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er good-will, be|cause I had some knowledg of his person: I had seen him at the <HI>Royal Society</HI>: I had been a witness with what civility he had been there entertain'd: I had been in|form'd
<PB N="10" REF="8">
what kindness he had receiv'd at <HI>Oxford</HI>: I had heard what favour the <HI>King</HI> had shewn him, by admit|ting him to private discour|ses with him in his Cabinet. And from all this I was in|couraged to beleive, that he had given an honourable, or at least a just description of <HI>England.</HI> But I quickly per|ceiv'd how much I was dis|appointed: I presently saw what difference there is be|tween scribling fine Haran|gues on vertuous Men, and real vertue it self. I strait
<PB N="11" REF="8">
found that instead of the <HI>good intentions, which</HI> he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pref.</HI></NOTE> <HI>he never wants,</HI> the greatest part of his Treatise consists of ill-grounded reproches: that he has ventur'd on ma|ny things, whereof it was impossible he should receive an account: that where he might be suppos'd to have some tolerable knowledge, his malice has perverted his understanding: and that through the whole course of his Observations, he has by his own example made good that character, which he of|ten
<PB N="12" REF="9">
in this Book bestows on humane Nature in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 188.</NOTE> <HI>that mankind is most pleas'd with trifles, and that we are all credulous and Lyars.</HI></P>
<P>In his <HI>Epistle Dedicatory,</HI> he assures the <HI>most Christian King,</HI> that <HI>the principal motive of his journey, was a desire to advance his Majesties glory.</HI> The Design was commend|able, and worthy an <HI>Historio|grapher Royal.</HI> But what course did he take to in|crease his renown? he says, <HI>that he travell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d abroad, on purpose to spread throughout
<PB N="13" REF="9">
the world, the fame of his Ma|jesties munificence to himself.</HI> I beseech you, Sir, how long will your English modesty overwhelm you? how much reason have You real <HI>Philo|sophers,</HI> and <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> to have high thoughts of your selves, if it shall be al|low'd to a man, who has onely got some name by creeping into your compa|nies, to beleive himself so considerable, that his Masters liberality to him ought to make to all mankind admire his Magnificence? The <HI>Chri|stian
<PB N="14" REF="10">
world</HI> has better signs of the greatness of the <HI>King of France's</HI> mind: his armies, and money have been hono|rably imploy'd against <HI>Al|giers</HI> and <HI>Constantinople.</HI> A|midst all these glorious ex|pences, what a mighty sound does it make, that <HI>the famous Monsieur de Sorbiere did re|ceive a small stipend out of his Treasury?</HI></P>
<P>But that you may the better understand, who this <HI>great man is,</HI> that can either exalt, or diminish the ho|nor of <HI>Princes</HI> with a word
<PB N="15" REF="10">
of his mouth: I intreat you to hear his own description of himself. I will onely repeat in his own words, the praises, which in the com|pass of a few leaves, he has given his own merits: by which you may ghess how uniustly he has misplac't, the titles of <HI>proud,</HI> and <HI>arrogant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 133.</NOTE> when he bestow'd them on one of the best Natured, and bashfullest Nations in the world.

concerning them:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Ded.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that his King did not favour him, without understanding him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell.</HI></P>
<P>Now Sir, would not a|ny man that reads this con|clude, that <HI>Monsieur de Sor|biere</HI> is his own <HI>Historian,</HI> more then the <HI>King of Fran|ce's.</HI> Is this conformable to his own Rule, which he sayes <HI>he prescribes to himself,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 93.</NOTE> <HI>not to make Elogies on any man?</HI> Before he had da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d to have said so much of him|self, ought he not to have exceeded <HI>Iulius Scaliger</HI> in

his Learning, and his nobi|lity, as well as he has done in his spite to our Country? whereas the plain, and the true story of <HI>Monsieur de Sor|bier's</HI> life, is only this, he was borne at <HI>Orange,</HI> and for a long time profess'd the <HI>Pro|testant Religion,</HI> all or the greatest part of his <HI>Writings</HI> have been only some fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Letters, a small <HI>Panegyric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or two, a translation of Mr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Hobbes's de Cive,</HI> into <HI>French this Description of England</HI> and another of <HI>Holland.</HI> Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> first imployment was to

<P>And yet you have no rea|son
<PB N="21" REF="13">
to think that he has been wanting to himself all this while, seeing in this very <HI>E|pistle</HI> you find him in plain terms <HI>beseeching his Majesty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Ded.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that he would employ him.</HI> 'Tis a modest request. But what other place is that which he can desire? he sayes that <HI>he has already been glorifi'd with the title of Trumpeter.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>P.</HI> 201.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="14">
For (according to his <HI>Bro|ther Trumpeter's</HI> defence of himself in the Fable) it is never requir'd of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch offi|cers, that they should in|gage in the fight, or do any <HI>Real Service,</HI> but they are onely us'd for a <HI>shew,</HI> and <HI>to make a noyse.</HI></P>
<P>As for his other Quali|fication of <HI>Historiographer Royal,</HI> I will shew you in one instance how he de|servs it. He tells his <HI>King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that he has reported in every Country where he came,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E.

But let us consider the authority of his testimo|ny. For <HI>Monsieur de Sorbi|ere, the Kings Historiographer,</HI> when he might have had so

<P>Upon the very entrance into his journey, as soon as he sets forth from <HI>Paris,</HI> he gives evident proofs of the lightness, and vanity, of his mind. From what he had said before in his own com|mendation.
<PB N="25" REF="15">
I began to fan|cy in my thoughts, a <HI>grave Philosopher,</HI> going forth with the intent to survey all civil States, that he might bring back their profitable Arts, and inrich his Native Coun|try with them. I call'd to mind the Examples of <HI>Py|thagoras, Solon, Thales, Pla|to,</HI> and almost all the first <HI>wise men</HI> amongst the <HI>Grecians</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who were wont to make long voyages into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the <HI>East,</HI> for such honourable purposes. And upon this thought I was inclin'd to
<PB N="26" REF="16">
forgive him all his former Boastings, and to look on them onely as pardonable imperfections, which some|times accompany <HI>great Wits.</HI> And hence, Sir, you may think how much I was sur|pris'd, when I saw that the first fruits of his travels <HI>were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n account of the pleasant com|pany, that he had on the way, of certain Polacks, that spoke Latine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>that could play on the Violin, and that gave him a daunce twice a day.</HI> But hold Sir, I will not give him this occasion, to confirm the
<PB N="27" REF="16">
sentence, which he has past upon us, that the <HI>English are of a gloomy, extravagant, fa|natick, melancholy humour.</HI> I am content to allow him these divertisements. It was fit that he, who went forth to civilize barbarous Nati|ons, should be attended as they were of old, with har|mony. Yet you cannot but be delighted, when you observe the choice that he made: that he who undertook to censure, and refine manners, and to promote inventions, he who talks of nothing less
<PB N="28" REF="17">
then <HI>intrigues with the Muses,</HI> should find nothing worth mentioning in his journy from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> but the <HI>Musick, and the dauncing of Poland.</HI> Seeing his skill is so good in one of the <HI>liberal Arts</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> seeing he was so well satisfi'd in <HI>France</HI> it self, with a <HI>Fiddle</HI> of <HI>Cracaw,</HI> or <HI>War|shaw.</HI> I wonder he would come into <HI>England,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earch for <HI>Philosophy,</HI> and had not rather gone to the <HI>famous V|niversity of Mosco.</HI></P>
<P>And yet, Sir, to speak the Truth, I can easily pardon

what greater recompence could a <HI>Royal Trumpeter</HI> make to <HI>Mounsieur de Courtebonne,</HI> then thus to sound up his meat? hitherto all is well.

officious frinds demand their own rates for having thus ob|lig'd us: so that sometimes we can scarce know, whether we should call it a Landing, or a Wreck.

Yet I make no Conclusion from hence against the whole <HI>French Nation,</HI> but only a|gainst the <HI>Porters,</HI> and <HI>Mari|ners,</HI> of <HI>Deip,</HI> and <HI>Calais.</HI> And the same Right ought <HI>Mon|sieur de Sorbiere</HI> to have done us.

this peculiar good Quality, that they love to have themselves handled plainly, and ill-spoken of.</HI> This he professes <HI>to mention in our praise.</HI> And if this be his Courtesie, I now find, that the <HI>Passengers with him in the Waggon</HI> had reason, when (as he com|plains) <HI>they interpreted his very Civilities for affronts.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 21.</NOTE> But hold, Sir, what is this that he here says? has the <HI>Eng|lish Nation</HI> ever caus'd its <HI>Character to be Printed</HI>? he speaks of it, as if it had been a thing done by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Par|liament,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="29">
and by the Autho|rity of the whole State. 'Tis true, Sir, there was (as you may perhaps remember) a small <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> that came out with the <HI>Title of the Cha|racter of England,</HI> about six years ago. But that was pretended to be a <HI>Translati|on</HI> out of <HI>French.</HI> Or let us suppose that it was an <HI>Englishman</HI> that writ it under that disguise: yet has <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere</HI> from thence any ground to say, that <HI>the whole English Nation has often printed its own Cha|racter?</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="29">
I will give him one instance to shew how ab|surdly he did thus conclude, from one particular man, to a whole Country. <HI>Mon|sieur de Sorbiere,</HI> in his <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Letters,</HI> has inserted (as he calls it) <HI>a Sceptical Di|scourse concerning the City of Paris</HI>: wherein he uses the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of all <HI>France,</HI> al|most as injuriously, as he does the <HI>English</HI> in this <HI>Re|lation</HI>; with language as foul, as the <HI>Dirt</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> it self. Now then, because <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere,</HI> a pri|vate
<PB N="54" REF="30">
inhabitant of <HI>Paris,</HI> has presum'd to slander it, in that manner; does it become me to affirm <HI>that the whole City of Paris has written a scandalous Libel on it self?</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps by this In|stance which I have here mention'd, <HI>Monsieur de Sor|biere</HI> will raise an Argu|ment, that shall be very much to his own advantage. For now he will be ready to say, that the <HI>English</HI> have no great reason to take his Affronts unkindly, seeing he has been already so free
<PB N="55" REF="30">
of his Corrections, and Re|proofs, as not to spare his own <HI>Countrymen</HI> themselves. I accept of his <HI>Apology.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Pietatis plena Defensio</HI>: 'Tis an excellent good Natur'd Defence, for his rayling a|gainst <HI>Strangers,</HI> that he has done the same before, against his own <HI>Fellow-Citi|zens.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>En|glish-Book,</HI> which he pro|poses as his Pattern. Seeing we have but one Libel in our Language, against a whole Country in general, let us
<PB N="56" REF="31">
permit the <HI>Historiographer Royal,</HI> to imitate it. Yet I cannot imagine how he came to uuderstand that <HI>Book</HI> alone, when he pro|fesses that he was utterly ignorant of the <HI>English-Tongue</HI> in all things else.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 20.</NOTE> It seems that reviling, and Sa|tyr is so natural to his mind, that he is able to conceive the sence of it, though the <HI>Language</HI> in which it is writ|ten, be never so much un|known to him. However, if he compare the times of their publication, we shall
<PB N="57" REF="31">
find that there is a great di|stinction between the crimes of the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>French Satyrist.</HI> The first of these was publish'd during the Tyranny of the late Usur|pers: and though it was ve|ry severe on the <HI>English</HI> in many passages, yet the great|est part was spoken with a good intention, in reproof of the miserable distractions of that Age, and the many ill-Customs which a long Civil-War had introduc'd. I beg of you now, Sir, to con|sider, by what an Example
<PB N="58" REF="32">
he clears himself. Because there was one Satyr writ|ten on our Nation, in a time of Licentiousness, and Con|fusion: he will second it now with a Worse, when we are setled in Peace, and Pro|sperity. Seeing he thinks this Plea sufficient, for what he says against the Manners of the <HI>English,</HI> that an <HI>Eng|lish-man did the same under Oliver,</HI> or <HI>Richard</HI>: I would have him also defend him|self in all his Slanders on our <HI>Court,</HI> and the <HI>King's Mini|sters,</HI> with an argument that
<PB N="59" REF="32">
will resemble the other. For why may he not assert, that it is lawful for him now to use such Liberty; because <HI>Milton</HI> was allow'd by the <HI>Rump,</HI> to write a Villa|nous Book against the late <HI>King</HI> of Blessed Memory?</P>
<P>This weak excuse there|fore, Sir, that he makes for his Barbarous way of hand|ling Us, shall not serve his turn. He is so far from ha|ving receiv'd incourage|ment from the <HI>English:</HI> that I can shew him several Vo|lumes of the Voyages of

<PB N="61" REF="33">

styl'd demands of just satis|faction? and which the <HI>great Soveraign</HI> of the <HI>Seas</HI> will shortly make appear to be a a Vindication of the Law of <HI>Nations?</HI> But if <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere</HI> beleives, that our present contentions with the <HI>Low-Countrymen,</HI> are only rude <HI>Affronts,</HI> and not just Grievances; I am certain he was once of another mind, when he writ his <HI>Let|ter to Monsieur de Courcelles in the year</HI> 1652. Wherein he extols the <HI>Rumps</HI> Victories over them, and presages
<PB N="80" REF="43">
a glorious Empire to those Tyrants, from their absolute subduing them.</P>
<P>He says, <HI>that we will not vouchsafe to speak to those that travel hither,</HI> and yet <HI>he calls us presumptuous, Raileurs, Ar|rogant, and Evil-Speakers.</HI> But to this it shall suffice me to reply, that seeing the same man condemns our Silence, and our Speech, it is a good Argument, that we are mo|derate, and unblamable in Both.</P>
<P>He declares, that <HI>We re|gard the Prosperity of others

with Iealousie</HI>: whereas, there is not one of our Neighbors, to whom our Assistance could reach, but we have ayded in their Calamities. The <HI>Vnited Provinces,</HI> not|withstanding their present apprehensions of us, will still confess that their <HI>Com|mon-Wealth</HI> was founded upon <HI>English Valour.</HI> The <HI>Great Henry</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was establish'd in his Throne by <HI>Queen Elizabeth's</HI> succours.

<P>He proceeds to affirm, that <HI>we will serve any man, that will feed us, suffer us to rail, and be idle.</HI> But to give him a full Testimony, how careful the <HI>English</HI> are of their own Liberty, it is e|nough to say, that they in|deavor, more then most o|ther Nations, to preserve in|violable the freedom of man|kind in general; For they never make Slaves of their Prisoners of War in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which perhaps
<PB N="83" REF="44">
few other Nations have for|born. And that the world has a better opinion of us, he may be convinc'd by this, that the Natives of all Tra|ding-Countries, have still maintain'd a peculiar re|spect for the <HI>English</HI> integri|ty; and that whereever the Bounds of our Empire have reach'd in antient Times, there still remains on the minds of the people, a Re|membrance of the easiness of the <HI>English</HI> Government. If all this will not satisfie him, that the <HI>English</HI> are not

of a more Servile Dispositi|on then other Countries; I will put him upon an Em|ployment, which may well become his Abilities: Let him make a computation of the Footmen, Grooms of Chambers, and Cooks in <HI>Europe,</HI> and then let him tell me, whether he finds those of the <HI>English Nation</HI> to be the most <HI>Numerous.</HI></P>
<P>He asserts, that the <HI>Eng|lish are suspicious, dark, ir|regular, caprichious, and that they haue a Melancholly pecu|liar to themselves.</HI> In this,

methinks his small Philoso|phy should have instructed him better, that such dismal qualities are not the neces|sary Companions of the Complexion of <HI>Angels, which he allows them.</HI> But he that <HI>went dauncing from Paris to Calais,</HI> and <HI>at Calais,</HI> as soon as he alighted out of the <HI>Chasse Marin,</HI> could not ab|stain from going to a Pup|pet-Play (for that I suppose he means, when he says, <HI>he saw a Comedy there</HI>) is not a fit man to Censure what is the difference, between what

is Fantastical, and good Humour, between the Seri|ous, and the Sullen. How|ever he has made some Re|compence to us for this dis|grace.

<PB N="88" REF="47">
The places that he vi|sited, were onely those on the Road to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and some few other No|blemens houses besides.

the <HI>English</HI> sluggishness, from the private way of liv|ing of our <HI>Scholars.</HI> It must be so, For every where else he beheld many marks of diligence.

<P>And first, it is false that <HI>our English Reformation be|gan upon a shamefull occasion,</HI> or from the extravagance of a private passion.

In breif therefore, Sir, it is evi|dent that <HI>King Henry the Eighth</HI> did never intend to proceed to a much greater distance from the <HI>Roman See,</HI> then the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church maintains at this day. There is no man of our <HI>Church,</HI> that

looks upon his breach with the <HI>Pope,</HI> to have been a <HI>Re|formation.</HI> We onely esteem it to be of the nature of those Quarrels, which many <HI>Princes</HI> in the most <HI>Catholick</HI> Countries, have manag'd a|gainst the <HI>Holy Chair.</HI> The <HI>Reformation</HI> to which we stand is of a latter date. The <HI>Primitive Reformers</HI> amongst us, beheld the Reason of men tamely subjected to one mans Command, and the Sovereign Powers of all <HI>Christendom</HI> still expos'd to be check'd, and destroy'd

by the Resolutions of his private Will.

sparingly spread. He never convers'd with the vast Bo|dy of Gentry, and Yeoman|ry that live Country lives, who are generally uninfe|cted. It is <HI>London</HI> alone on which he must rely for this calculation. And yet even in this too, I dare openly assure him, that the farr greater number is for the Rights of the Church, then against them. But I advise <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere,</HI> that be|fore he thinks himself able to make an exact judgment of the Number of our Reli|gious
<PB N="112" REF="59">
Sects, he would first correct all his errours in <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> which are to be found in this Book, about the most obvious things, in reckoning of which, it was enough to have onely had the understanding of the least childe that he ever taught. I will onely produce one in this place. Have we not reason to rely upon his opinion of the difference of the parties in the whole Kingdom; when in the least number that can be, he has mistaken half: For, he says,
<PB N="113" REF="59">
that <HI>the double-bottom'd. Vessel has two Masts in the Front,</HI> when every <HI>Sculler</HI> on the <HI>Thames</HI> knows it has but <HI>One.</HI></P>
<P>He affirms, that <HI>the Go|vernment of our Bishops is no|thing else, but the shaddow, and the corruption of a True Hierarchy.</HI> And he gives this excellent Reason for it, <HI>be|cause here the Spiritual sub|mits to the Temporal.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 44.</NOTE> This ve|ry Argument I will turn up|on himself. It is therefore the True, the Sound, the <HI>Apostolical Episcopacy: be|cause
<PB N="114" REF="60">
it does yield to the Tem|poral Power, which else could be nothing but a shaddow.</HI> It is the glory of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that it never re|sisted Authority, nor in|gag'd in Rebellion: which is a praise, that makes much to its advantage, in the minds of all those, who have read of the dismal effects of the <HI>Scotch Covenant,</HI> and the <HI>holy League.</HI></P>
<P>He says, that <HI>our King did put himself on the most dange|rous Enterprise that could be attempted, when he restored
<PB N="115" REF="60">
Episcopacy.</HI> And yet he con|fesses that <HI>our other Sects are inconsistent with any Govern|ment but a Common-wealth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 58.</NOTE> What dreadfull danger could be imagin'd in a <HI>Mo|narchs</HI> destroying that, which must needs fall of it self in a <HI>Monarchy?</HI> But to shew how much he was mistaken, It is evident, that upon his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s most glorious Re|turn, the <HI>Church</HI> soon reco|ver'd all its rights of Eccle|siastical Jurisdiction, of sit|ting in Parliament, and even all its Lands, which had
<PB N="116" REF="61">
been long held by Armed Usurpers, without any o|ther Opposition, then what was made by <HI>General Vennor,</HI> and his forty men: who it seems did <HI>run the greatest hazard of the two.</HI></P>
<P>He declares that <HI>there is so great a distance between our Bishops, and our inferior Cler|gy, that these dare not speak to, nor stand cover'd before, them.</HI> This, Sir, you and I can prove to be a manifest Untruth, by several Instan|ces. But however, what course can we take to please
<PB N="117" REF="61">
this grave Censurer of our Civility? <HI>He here dislikes the respects, that we shew to our cheif Churchmen:</HI> and in an|other place, <HI>He condemns the familiar behaviour of our com|mon Soldiers towards their Of|ficers. He abuses the Clergy|men for standing bare to those Reverend and Aged Persons; and the Red-Coats for keeping on their Hatts in the presence of their Captains.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 122.</NOTE> How suffi|cient a Judge is he of good manners, that would bring the rude Customs of a <HI>Camp</HI> into the <HI>Church,</HI> and the Pun|ctilio's
<PB N="118" REF="62">
of Observance, and Courtship, into an <HI>Army.</HI></P>
<P>But he accuses us of a greater Crime. It is but just that there should be <HI>so great a distance,</HI> if our <HI>Clergymen that have Pluralities, make their Grooms supply their Cures.</HI> In this part of his Character he certainly, Sir, mistook the Country, and intended this for some other <HI>Kingdom</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> where he had also miss'd of a <HI>Medall.</HI> It is a sign that he is as little ac|quainted with his own <HI>Church,</HI> as he is with ours:
<PB N="119" REF="62">
or else he would never have <HI>objected to us our Pluralities,</HI> which are infinitely fewer, and more confin'd amongst us: he would never have ventur'd to <HI>upbraid us with the Ignorance of our Parish Priests,</HI> lest we should have provok'd the whole <HI>Church of Rome</HI> to a comparison. In breif, Sir, our <HI>Slaves</HI> do not serve at our <HI>Altars</HI>: and I will also add, that our <HI>Cheif Spiritual Dignities</HI> are not in|tayl'd upon <HI>Families,</HI> nor possess'd by <HI>Children.</HI> In all the <HI>Parishes</HI> of <HI>England</HI>; I

dare challenge not onely him that is a Stranger, but the most bitter Enemies to our Discipline, to shew me <HI>Twenty Pulpits,</HI> that are fill'd with men, who have not spent their Youth in Studies to prepare them, and who have not the <HI>Au|thority</HI> of <HI>Holy Orders.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>He has presum'd to call our Publique Solemn Prayers, only a Morsel, or a Scrap of a Liturgy</HI>; I do not much wonder. For he that has long made his own <HI>Religion his Cook</HI> (as one of
<PB N="121" REF="63">
our Poets expresses it) may well be thought irreligious enough; to take a <HI>Metaphor</HI> for ours from a Kitchin. But besides this, he asserts, that <HI>the Introduction of the En|glish Liturgy into Scotland, was the cause of the shedding of all the Blood in the three Na|tions.</HI> This Speech might have well fitted the mouth of <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> or the Pen of <HI>Ireton.</HI> For it lays all the guilt of so much Slaughter, on the most Innocent, and most merciful <HI>Prince,</HI> that ever wore a Crown: by
<PB N="122" REF="64">
whose special care, an Uni|formity of Worship was at|tempted in that <HI>Kingdome.</HI> But to give him better light, and to let him see, that there were other Causes of our Miseries, in one of these three Countries at least, I would fain have him ask this Question of the <HI>Pope's Legat</HI> that was in <HI>Ireland,</HI> whether the horrible <HI>Irish Massacre</HI> was committed for no other reason, but only out of a tender Brotherly sense of the Yoke which was laid by the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> on
<PB N="123" REF="64">
the <HI>Scotchmen's</HI> Consciences.</P>
<P>He tells us, that <HI>it is an ordinary thing with our Bi|shops, to exercise their Eccle|siastical Censures upon frivolous accounts.</HI> But methinks he might have remembred, that it was not probable, they should seek out any trifling occasions of excommunica|tion, when, by his own con|fession, they have so ma|ny weighty Provocations: if that be true, that <HI>the whole Nation neglects their Disci|pline.</HI> But, Sir, you know it is apparent to all indiffe|rent
<PB N="124" REF="65">
Men, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> have been most remarkably moderate in their <HI>Visitations</HI>: and that the Punishments, which have been inflicted on the Obstinate, have for the most part proceeded from the <HI>Temporal</HI> Sword, and not the <HI>Spiritual.</HI> But, because he here quarrels at the Absoluteness of our <HI>Bi|shop</HI>'s power, I leave him to be answer'd by the whole <HI>Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> who ought to be alarm'd by this.

a good part of their gains, they have compounded with a very great Number of the Purchasers; they have in|creas'd the Vicaredges in their Gift to Fourscore Pounds a year: they have indow'd Alms-Houses, and Colleges, they have built Chappels, they have re|paired the Episcopal Pala|ces, and Cathedrals, which were generally gone to Ru|ine; they have redeem'd at once all the <HI>English,</HI> that were Slaves at <HI>Algiers,</HI> and that too I dare assure him,

<HI>without any intent to make Cu|rats of them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Account which he gives of their letting Leases</HI> is most ridiculous.

<PB N="129" REF="67">
of <HI>Church Leases</HI> is a busi|ness, whose Regulation was brought about since the time, that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> divided from us.

<P>But to Conclude, if <HI>no Man fears Simony in England,</HI> then there is no man that is affrighted with punishment. For our Laws are as strict against it, and as severely executed, as any where else. However, if it were true, (which is far from being so) that we Simoniacally imploy the Church estate to Secular uses; yet this sounds very ill from that <HI>Layman's</HI> Pen, who, when he writ this Voyage, was main|tain'd

out of the <HI>Ecclesiasti|cal Revenue.</HI> This, Sir, was <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere's Case.</HI> And the first Office of a <HI>Churchman</HI> that ever he per|form'd, was in this Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 99.</NOTE> where <HI>He devoutly prays to God, to make Mr. Hobbs a Roman Catholique.</HI> Which if his prayers can obtain from Heaven, he deserves not only to be made a <HI>Priest,</HI> or <HI>Bishop,</HI> but even a <HI>Saint</HI> too: For this will be a far greater <HI>Miracle,</HI> then any of those for which many have been <HI>Canoniz'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="69">And now, Sir, can you require any greater signs of <HI>Monsieur de Sorbier's</HI> Sinceri|ty in his <HI>Religion</HI>?

of <HI>Mr. Hobbes's,</HI> whom he pretends to admire, as he is of the Apostles.) Not|withstanding all which im|pudent Disgraces, there remains this one comfort to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that the same man, who now vi|lifies Her so basely, had once as mean thoughts of the <HI>God-Head</HI> of Her blessed <HI>Founder</HI> Himself.</P>
<P>But it is easie to conje|cture at the Cause of this his harsh Usage of our <HI>Church.</HI> He had but lately Aposta|tiz'd from the <HI>Reformed Re|ligion</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="70">
in <HI>France</HI>: he was but just enter'd into the <HI>Romish</HI> Communion. And he su|spected, that there might be some doubts still remain|ing on mens minds, of the Reality of his Conversion, which might turn to the prejudice not onely of his Spiritual, but of his Tem|poral Estate: he had given himself out for a great <HI>Phi|losopher:</HI> and he understood well enough, that few Phi|losophers are thought to al|ter their minds, that have once been <HI>Protestants.</HI> He
<PB N="135" REF="70">
was therefore resolv'd to give an Unquestionable proof of his Establishment in the Faith, by reviling <HI>the Church of England.</HI> And in performing this, I con|fess, Sir, he has Counter|feited the Zealot very well: he has prosecuted Us, with all the Violence, and Bi|gottry, which commonly accompanies new Converts. But yet I beleive this will hardly do his business. Even in this very Book, he gives Evidence enough, that <HI>Cal|vinism,</HI> and <HI>Heresie,</HI> are not
<PB N="136" REF="71">
wholy rooted out of his Heart. He grosly abuses the most devoted Children of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>English Roman Catholiques.</HI> He complains of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 64.</NOTE> <HI>that they have no mind to disturb the Peace of their Country to|mards the restoration of their Religion</HI>: which is indeed spoken to their Honour, though he intends it to their Shame. He says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 64.</NOTE> <HI>that they are not so zealous in their Way, as forein Papists,</HI> the quite contrary to which is true: he makes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 64.</NOTE> <HI>as if they never

But a|bove all, he has set down such a determination of his Faith, that if he had made it in <HI>Italy,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> he had undoubtedly fallen into the <HI>Inquisition.</HI> He boldly pro|nounces, that <HI>Transubstan|tiation,

<P>But I leave him to be cor|rected by the Pope's Sen|tence

for these Heresies: which perhaps the Holy Fa|ther has reason to think, do more shake the Holy Chair, then the five points of <HI>Ian|senius</HI> that he condemn'd: which Monsieur de Sorbiere says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 60.</NOTE> <HI>did raise a dispute about a matter of Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>From our <HI>Religion,</HI> Let us follow him of our <HI>Govern|ment.</HI> And here, Sir, I was at first a little at a stand how to deal with him. But I have heard of the Magna|nimous resolution of the

late <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who would never permit any <HI>Apology</HI> to be written for him.

I will not therefore inlarge my Speech in the praises of the present hap|piness of <HI>England,</HI> or in paying all the acknowledge|ments, which are due to our <HI>Sovereign,</HI> for the bles|sings of His <HI>Reign.</HI> That is
<PB N="141" REF="73">
a Subject ficter for a more elaborate Volum, then a sin|gle Letter, and for a far more elegant Pen then mine.

<PB N="142" REF="74" MS="y">
of disrespect to <HI>Monarchy,</HI> or <HI>Sovereign Princes,</HI> when you behold him so Panegy|rically given towards that Government, as to take the pains, to go five or six thou|sand miles, to find out a Race of <HI>Kings</HI> to commend.

<PB N="143" REF="74" MS="y">
him in this place. I will not call in question the credit of his Intelligence from the farthest East, which you see is so false, about a Country, that lies only <HI>seven Leagues distant</HI> from his own. Nay, I will not so much as inquire whether e|ver he met with any <HI>Chinese Madam Fiennes to give him this Information.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 118.</NOTE> I will graunt, that the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>China</HI> have been <HI>great Men|ders of Bridges,</HI> and <HI>Planters of Orchards.</HI> But I will on|ly now softly put him in
<PB N="144" REF="75">
mind, that while his Pen did overflow with sweet words, upon the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> he has handled the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> more cruelly, then <HI>Dionysi|us</HI> the Tyrant would have done, when he was a <HI>King,</HI> much less when he was a <HI>Schole-Master.</HI></P>
<P>Of the two last <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> he affirms, that <HI>their Glory is almost wholy vanish'd:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 116.</NOTE> <HI>and that all moderate men must needs read the Desolations, which they caus'd with Horror.</HI> You see, Sir, what an excel|lent
<PB N="145" REF="75">
occasion he has here given me of Triumphing over him. You know very well, how many great, and irresistable arguments, this matter might suggest to me: what might not be said of that <HI>Victorious Nation?</HI> how copious might I be in ex|tolling the indefatigable In|dustry, the Conduct, the Good Fortune, the Gene|rosity of those <HI>Kings</HI>? What Passions might here be rais'd, in appealing to all Mankind, and in aggrava|ting the common misery of
<PB N="146" REF="76">
all Great Commanders of Armies, if it shall be per|mitted to every small Pam|phleteer to invade their Lives, and to arraign their Ashes, when he pleases? But there is no need of go|ing so powerfully to work, or of imploying against him any of the Lofty, and Tra|gical Forces of Eloquence. It will suffice, if I recall to his Memory, the Title in which he boasts so much. I will only ask him, how the <HI>Historiographer</HI> of <HI>France</HI> can assert the Wars of <HI>Gustavus
<PB N="147" REF="76">
Adolphus</HI> to have been hor|rible Divastations, without casting some share of the Dishonor on the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>France</HI> it self? For (if we will believe all the <HI>French</HI> Writers of that time) there was a strict Confederacy, and a real Union of Interests, be|tween those Two <HI>mighty Mo|narchs.</HI> I give him leave to use the Fame of the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> as he pleases. Let them in his account pass for Theives, and Oppres|sors. They deserve so to be us'd: for they were mor|tal
<PB N="148" REF="77">
Enemies to that belov'd Country, with whose <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ick,</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and <HI>Dancing,</HI> he was before so much <HI>ravish'd.</HI> I only bid him look back on the relation, which <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Iust</HI> had to <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Fourteenth,</HI> and then let him try to vindicate himself for overturning the Trophies of the <HI>Father,</HI> in the same <HI>Book,</HI> wherein he declares, that <HI>He travell'd abroad in a Waggon,</HI> to spread the glo|ry of the Son.</P>
<P>But the Fame of those <HI>dead Princes</HI> is plac'd above
<PB N="149" REF="77">
the reach of his Envy: let us, Sir, consider how he be|haves himself towards the living. What a long Story (or rather, as he himself stiles it, <HI>Romance</HI>) has he here made, of the life of <HI>Vlefelt</HI> the <HI>Dane, on which he builds the justification of his Crimes, and condemns the King of Denmark's Iustice?</HI> And yet at the same time he acknowledges, that <HI>He took the whole Relation, only from the Mouth of Vlefelt's own Wife.</HI> After this, have the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>China</HI> any great reason to be
<PB N="150" REF="78">
proud of this Mans good will? when he has here ex|press'd no more Judgment, nor Integrity, then from the single and partial Infor|mation of a Woman, to ac|quit a man that had been hang'd <HI>in Effigie</HI> in <HI>Den|mark,</HI> and has been since kill'd as he was pursued for High Treason?</P>
<P>Upon the sight of all this, Sir, I may well return se|curely Home, to examine his opinion of the Imper|fections of our State. And here I must not forget to
<PB N="151" REF="78">
acquaint you, that he is not all over Satyrical; But in several places he sprinkles some few kind words to our advantage. Yet his Com|mendations are so directly contrary to his reproaches; that instead of reconciling me to him, they rather sup|ply me with new arguments against him. And who can desire an easier Adver|sary to deal with, then such a one, who, when he speaks against us, opposes evident Truth, when he speaks for us, contradicts himfelf?</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="79">This Inconsistence of his own mind with it self, is ap|parent in this <HI>Political</HI> part of his <HI>Relation,</HI> which now comes under my Censure: He confesses, <HI>Our King to be one of the best Princes in the World:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 123.</NOTE> He declares, that <HI>His Majesty us'd him with all imaginable sweetness, and that by the Charms of His Discourse, he sent him away as well pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, as if he had loaded him with his Presents.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 120.</NOTE> I intreat you now, Sir, to recollect, how this, and that which follows hangs together.</P>

It is fit that all the World should know, that as our <HI>King</HI> was restor'd with the most mira|culous

submission of minds, and interests, that ever any <HI>History</HI> can shew: as he was establish'd on the Throne of his <HI>Ancestors,</HI> while there were two mighty Armies on Foot, that had fought against <HI>him</HI> and his <HI>Father</HI>: so there can be no difficulty in con|tinuing this quiet, now he has all the power of the Na|tion in his hands, and now his Enemies are scattered, and disarm'd (if yet he can be thought to have any real Enemies, after so ma|ny Heroick Testimonies of
<PB N="155" REF="80">
his Mercy) The condition of all his affairs abroad is in such a posture, in respect of his Neighbors, that he is as far from being lyable to re|ceive Injuries unreveng'd, as he is averse in his own disposition from doing wrongs unprovok'd. And the small dissentions that still remain on some of his Subjects minds at home, are so far from hazarding the safety, that they will rather make for the Honor of his <HI>Reign.</HI> For by his renew'd and generous indeavors to|wards
<PB N="156" REF="81">
the composing of these differences, there will arise for him a continued succession of Peaceful Tri|umphs, of which the occa|sions had been wanting to him, if he had found us all of one mind. And many such Victories as these, we may justly presage to our <HI>Sovereigns</HI> future Govern|ment.

<PB N="157" REF="81">
Who ever contends with his Adversaries with those wea|pons, he has not only his own Virtues, but theirs on his side. And as these are the surest Conquests, so they are of the greatest renown. In the Triumphs of Warr, his Souldiers, his Comman|ders, and even Fortune it self, would come in for a share in the Fame: But those which are obtain'd by pity, and by pardoning, have no Partners in the ho|nor, but are wholy to be at|tributed to the <HI>King</HI> himself.</P>

Land-Flood, which, as it comes down, carries with it Trees, and Stones, and Houses, and all that it meets in the way.

from every part of the Country. This allusion, Sir, I think does represent the whole matter to your mind. If it does not, how|ever I have return'd <HI>Monse|eur de Sorbiere,</HI> an ill Simili|tude for one of his, where <HI>he compares the Protestants to the Ottoman Empire</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 47.</NOTE> which is so much an <HI>Intrigue of the Muses,</HI> that I will challenge all the Witts of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> to interpret it.

let them remember of how little value his <HI>Panegyricks</HI> are, seeing <HI>he calls Vsefelt a Heroe:</HI> and if they will still maintain that they restor'd the <HI>King,</HI> let them take heed lest some mischievous <HI>Royallist</HI> should tell them, that in one sence they did indeed occasion the <HI>Kings</HI> Restoration.

<P>But the chief Secret into which he has pierc'd, is the late Controversie between <HI>my Lord Chancellor,</HI> and the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Bristol.</HI> What subtle conclusions does he draw from it? what pro|phetical visions does he here reveal, concerning the terrible disturbances, that shall arise to our <HI>Govern|ment,</HI>

his office of <HI>Trum|peter,</HI> and a dreadfull Battle will no doubt ensue. But how comes it to pass that all these Rumors of mighty warrs did vanish on the sudden?

Alas, Sir, all this was only a fine story of incounters in the Air, whereof there was no other foundation then in the wild fancies of his own making. And may we not give that Character of our <HI>Historian,</HI> which he does of

one of the Noble Comba|tants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 126.</NOTE> <HI>that his great Wit has inclin'd him to be Romantick?</HI> Is not this the true trick of a <HI>Romancer,</HI> to bring in ma|ny <HI>Princes</HI> fighting together in a wood, without giving any account how they came thither?</P>
<P>But the danger is over. All is quiet again; and long may it so keep. For to speak t'yee, Sir, <HI>from the bot|tome of Monsieur de Sorbier's heart, Peace is better then Warr.</HI> Well then.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 129.</NOTE> <HI>He grants that the Victory did a

And here, Sir, I confess he has driven me upon one of the tenderest points in the world; which is the speaking concerning the fame of a great Man, while he is living. But I entreat you to lay before your eyes the many power|full arguments, by which I am mov'd at least to give a true testimony, though not a long elogie, concerning him.
<PB N="194" REF="100">
<HI>My Lord Chancellor</HI> is a man through whose hands the greatest part of all the pub|lique and private businesses of our Countrey do pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> And it will be most disho|nourable for us, to suffer his name to be revil'd in this manner, while he is scarce at leisure to look to its defence himself, by rea|son of his eternal Labors for the publique Justice and Safety. And besides this, Sir, I can, for my own par|ticular, allege another mo|tive of nearer concernment.
<PB N="195" REF="100">
For I am to consider my self, as a Member of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and the <HI>Vni|versity</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the <HI>Earl of Clarendon,</HI> as <HI>Pro|tector of one them,</HI> and <HI>Chan|cellor</HI> of the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>These, Sir, are some of his true Titles, however <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere</HI> is pleas'd to pass them over, and give him worse in their stead. First of all, <HI>he says that he is a Presbyterian.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 125.</NOTE> At this ridiculous scandall, I assure you, Sir, I am not much griev'd. I was (to
<PB N="196" REF="101">
tell you true) in a terrible affright, when I read what he reports,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 127.</NOTE> that <HI>almost all the City of London are Pres|byterians.</HI> But now this passage has compos'd my mind again: For it is like to be a very exact compu|tation, which he has made of that Sect, when the first man that he names for a <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> is <HI>my Lord Chan|cellor.</HI> He next tells us, that <HI>he is a man of the Law</HI>; a shamefull disgrace: the <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whose Office it is to govern
<PB N="197" REF="101">

<PB N="198" REF="102">
in all times have manag'd the greatest Imployments of that State? Could he not have recollected, before he writ this, that <HI>Monsieur de Segnier,</HI> the present <HI>Chan|cellor</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> is a <HI>Gentle|man</HI> of the <HI>Long Robe?</HI> You see, Sir, what a good <HI>Saty|rist</HI> we have here got, who would undertake to abuse an <HI>English Statesman</HI> with such an argument, which must at the same time re|flect as much upon his own Countreymen, his chief Friends, and Patrons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to
<PB N="199" REF="102">
whom he directs his Speech. But the worst is still behind. <HI>My Lord Chancellor is utterly ignorant of the Belles Lettres.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 125.</NOTE> This accusation is as decent as all the former. <HI>He dis|likes our Carriers, for not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing Courtly; our Souldiers, for not putting off their Hatts well; our Bishops, for their Gravity; and our States-men, for not be|ing Grammarians, and Cri|ticks.</HI> But I will prove to him, by his own confession, that <HI>My Lord Chancellor</HI> de|serves not this reprehensi|on, and that he is a man
<PB N="200" REF="103">
skillful in <HI>all Polite Learn|ing. He himself allows him to be a great Politician,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 126.</NOTE> <HI>and a very Eloquent Man.</HI> I have obtain'd, Sir, what I desir'd. You see how easy it is to justify the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Claren|don,</HI> seeing the very man, that vilifies him, does at the same time gainsay himself, and suggest to me his pray|ses, without my interposing any word in his commenda|tion. If we should graunt, that a man may chance to be a great dealer in <HI>Politicks,</HI> without understanding any

thing else (which y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t no|thing but <HI>Monsieur de Sorbi|ere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> own example in this place, can perswade us to be possible) yet <HI>how can he be thought to attain to a perfect Eloquence without any skill in the Civil Arts?</HI> Where now is <HI>his Polite Learning</HI>? whence did he fetch this Idea of <HI>E|loquence?</HI> Let him produce his Notes out of <HI>Aristotle, Tully, Quintilian, Seneca,</HI> or any of the <HI>Rhetoricians</HI> of Antiquity; And then let him tell me, whether they do not all with one voyce
<PB N="202" REF="104">
consent, that an <HI>Orator</HI> must of necessity be acquainted with all sorts of useful know|ledg? But because he is so free in his reproof of my <HI>Lord Chancellors unskillful|ness in the Belles Lettres</HI>: I pray, Sir, what signs has this great <HI>Aristarchus</HI> him|self given, of his own pro|ficience in them? Where do we find in him any foot|steps of the True Spirit of the <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Wit? What reason have we to en|vy his judgment in the <HI>Clas|sical Authors,</HI> when all the
<PB N="203" REF="104">
proof that he has given in this Book, of his being con|versant in them, are only three or four pedantical Quotations, of which the chief is,
<Q><L>Os Homini sublime dedit?</L></Q>
Thus farr, Sir, in re|ply to him: But more is to be added concerning the <HI>Honourable Person,</HI> of whom he speaks in such mean terms. My <HI>Lord Chan|cellor</HI> is a Gentleman of a very antient Family, of which Mr <HI>Cambden</HI> makes mention in his <HI>Britannia.</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="105">
His Education and first years were spent in a strict familiarity with many of the most Famous Men, not only of that Age, but per|haps of any other: of whom (to pass by some Reverend and Learned <HI>Church-men</HI> that are living) it is enough to name Mr <HI>Chillingsworth,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Falkland.</HI> His first application to the Affairs of his Countrey, was in a time wherein ex|traordinary fidelity and sufficience were requir'd. His Services to the late
<PB N="205" REF="105">
<HI>King</HI> were requited by the committing of many emi|nent Businesses to his ma|nagement; and by a very high share in his <HI>Majesties</HI> Favour; of which there are indelible proofs in many places of that <HI>Excellent Prince's Letters.</HI> Under him he was <HI>Chancellor</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer, Privy Counsellor,</HI> and design'd <HI>Secretary</HI> of <HI>State.</HI> Since that time h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was <HI>Extraordinary Embassa|dor into Spain,</HI> and attended his present <HI>Master</HI> in his Misfortunes, which was un|doubtedly
<PB N="206" REF="106">
the most glorious Scene of Honour in the world. By these several degrees of Great Imploy|ments, he ascended to that illustrious Station which he now enjoyes. And as for the Qualifications of his Minde, if it be needfull to adde any thing to the Votes of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and the <HI>Vniversity</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> I will declare, that of all the men of great worth, who have possess'd that High Office, since Learning and the Ci|vill Arts came amongst us,
<PB N="207" REF="106">
there was never any man that has so much resem|bled Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> in their se|veral Excellencies, as the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Clarendon.</HI></P>
<P>There might, Sir, much more be answer'd against all his false Insinuations, con|cerning the <HI>Political Condi|tion</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> But I have seen a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere's Discourses</HI> and <HI>Let|ters,</HI> whereof many were written to the late <HI>Cardinal Mazarini</HI>; and they are so full of gross flatteries, that
<PB N="208" REF="107">
they have wholly turn'd my stomach, from speaking any more of <HI>State Affairs:</HI> So that in truth, in the present humour into which the rea|ding of them has put me, I had much rather offend on the other extream, by an unjust silence, then by im|pertinent praises of the <HI>English Government.</HI> I will therefore conclude this whole matter, as I began it, by reflecting on a Passage of his own, in the story of <HI>Vlefelt</HI>; wherein he has gi|ven undeniable testimony,
<PB N="209" REF="107">
that he is wholly ignorant of the Rights of Princes, the true Policy, and the Law of Nations. He af|firms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 184.</NOTE> that <HI>Vlefelt fled into Sweden; that he became there|by effectually a Traytor, that he was the cause of the Swedes last invasion into Denmark, by advising</HI> Carolus Gustavus <HI>to turn his Army, from the Poles, against Coppenhagen.</HI> These are his own words.

of that <HI>Kingdome?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 186.</NOTE> And yet immediately after he professes, <HI>that he makes no doubt, but the Illustrious He|roes, Vlefelt, and his Wife, will live to see their great merits acknowledg'd, and to enjoy in peace the applauses that are due to them for their fidelity to their King, and their zeal for the Fundamental Laws of their Countrey.</HI></P>
<P>But this, Sir, I suppose, is one of those which he himself calls the <HI>Besueues of his stile:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pref.</HI></NOTE> which though (as he says) <HI>Monsieur de Vau|brun

<P>This is the Idea that he has drawn of the <HI>Manners,</HI> the <HI>Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Govern|ment</HI> of the <HI>English.</HI> But these are not the subjects which he principally re|gards: such matters as these, he confesses, that <HI>he only uses to touch upon, as they come in his way.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pref.</HI></NOTE> I will now therefore, Sir, consider his <HI>commerce with the chief heads of Parnassus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep.

<P>He comes to describe the <HI>Weekly assemblies</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society</HI>: and he does it in words becoming a meeting of Natural Philo|sophers. <HI>The Vsher carries

<PB N="238" REF="122">
Can you, Sir, indure to read all this stuff with any pa|tience?

yielded him so much noble matter for his Pen? And when the <HI>Royal Society</HI> it self is so careful, that such ce|remonies should be just no more, then what are necessa|ry to avoyd confusion?

<P>But all this is still par|donable: he has been utterly mistaken in the report of their main design. There are two things, that they have most industriously a|voided, which he attributes

to them: the one <HI>is a dividing into parties, and Sects; and</HI> the other, <HI>a reliance upon Books, for their intelligence of Nature.</HI> He first says, that <HI>they are not all guided by the authority of Gassendus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 92.</NOTE> <HI>or Des Cartes</HI>; but <HI>that the Mathe|maticians are for Des Cartes, and the Men of General Lear|ning for Gassendus.</HI> Where|as neither of these two Men bear any sway amongst them: they are never nam'd there as Dictators over men's Reasons; nor is there any extraordinary re|ference

<P>I now pass over to his chief delight, the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> of the <HI>English.</HI> He grants <HI>our Stage to be handsom, the Musick tolerable,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 167.</NOTE> better I sup|pose, then that of the <HI>Polack Gentleman.</HI> But yet he says that <HI>our Poets laugh at the Rules of Time,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 167.</NOTE> <HI>and Place: that all our Playes contain the Actions of Five and Twenty years:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 168.</NOTE> <HI>that we Marry a Prince in the First Act, and bring in

<PB N="247" REF="126">
of Wit, and delight: I will not enter into open defiance of them, upon <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere's</HI> account, but I in|treat them to permit me on|ly to try a civill Turna|ment with them in his <HI>War of Letters.</HI> I will therefore make no scruple to maintain that the <HI>English</HI> Plays ought to be preferr'd before the <HI>French.</HI> And to prove this, I will not insist on an argu|ment, which is plain to a|ny observer, that the great|est part of their most excel|lent pieces have been taken
<PB N="248" REF="127">
from the <HI>Spaniard:</HI> where|as the <HI>English</HI> have for the most part trodden in new ways of Invention. From hence I will not draw much advantage: though it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erve to balance that which he afterwards says of our Books,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 169.</NOTE> that <HI>they are generally stoln out of other Authors.</HI> But I will fetch the grounds of my persuasion, from the very nature, and use, of the Stage it self. It is beyond all dispute, that the true in|tention of such Represen|tations, is, to give to man|kind
<PB N="249" REF="127">
a Picture of themselves; and thereby to make Virtue belov'd, Vice abhor'd, and the little irregularities of mens tempers, call'd hu|mors, expos'd to laughter. The Two first of these are the proper subjects of <HI>Tra|gedy,</HI> and <HI>Trage-Comedy.</HI> And in these I will first try to shew, why our way ought to be preferr'd before theirs. The <HI>French,</HI> for the most part, take only one, or two Great Men, and chiefly insist on some one remarkable accident of
<PB N="250" REF="128">
their Story: To this end, they admit no more Persons, then will barely serve to a|dorn that: And they ma|nage all in Rhythme, with long Speeches, almost in the way of Dialogues, in ma|king high Ideas of Honor, and in speaking Noble things. The <HI>English,</HI> on the other side, make their chief Plot to consist of a greater variety of Actions, and besides the main design, add many other little con|trivances. By this means, their Scenes are shorter,
<PB N="251" REF="128">
their Stage fuller, many more Persons of different Humors are introduc'd. And in carrying on of this, they generally do only con|fine themselves to blanck Verse. This is the diffe|rence. And hence the <HI>En|glish</HI> have these advantages. By the liberty of Prose, they render their Speech, and Pronuntiation, more natu|ral, and are never put to make a contention between the Rhythm, and the Sence. By their underplots, they often change the minds of
<PB N="252" REF="129">
their Spectators: which is a mighty Benefit, seeing one of the greatest Arts of Wit and persuasion, is the right ordering of Digressions. By their full Stage, they prevent men's being conti|nually tyr'd with the same Objects: and so they make the Doctrine of the Scene to be more lively, and divert|ing, then the precepts of Philosophers, or the grave delight of <HI>Heroick Poetry</HI>: which the <HI>French Tragedies</HI> do resemble. Nor is it sufficient to object against
<PB N="253" REF="129">
this, that it is undecent to thrust in men of mean con|dition, amongst the actions of <HI>Princes.</HI> For why should that misbecome the Stage, which is always found to be acted on the <HI>True Theatre</HI> of the World? There be|ing no Court, which only consists of <HI>Kings,</HI> and <HI>Queens,</HI> and <HI>Counsellors</HI> of <HI>State.</HI> Up|on these accounts, Sir, in my weak judgment, the <HI>French Drama</HI> ought to give place to the <HI>English,</HI> in the Tragical and lofty part of it. And now having ob|tain'd
<PB N="254" REF="130">
this, I suppose they will of their own accord resigne the other excellence, and confess that we have far exceeded them in the re|presentation of different Humors. The Truth is, the <HI>French</HI> have alwaies seem'd almost asham'd of the true <HI>Comedy</HI>: making it not much more then the subject of their <HI>Farses:</HI> whereas the <HI>English</HI> Stage has so much abounded with it, that perhaps there is scarce any sort of extrava|gance of which the minds
<PB N="255" REF="130">
of men are capable, but they have in some measure express'd. It is in <HI>Comedies,</HI> and not in <HI>Solemn Histories,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> use to <HI>re|late the Speeches</HI> of <HI>Waggo|ners,</HI> of <HI>Fencers,</HI> and of <HI>Com|mon Souldiers.</HI> And this I dare assure <HI>Monsieur de Sor|biere,</HI> that if he had under|stood our Language, he might have seen himself in all his shapes, as a <HI>vain Tra|veller,</HI> an <HI>empty Politician,</HI> an <HI>insolent Pedant,</HI> and an <HI>idle pretender to Learning.</HI> But though he was not in a
<PB N="256" REF="131">
condition of taking advice from our Stage, for the cor|recting of his own Vices, yet methinks he might thereby have rectify'd his judgment about ours: he might well have concluded, that the <HI>English temper, is not so universally heavy and dumpish,</HI> when he beheld their Theatres, to be the gayest, and merriest in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>English Eloquence,</HI> he bravely de|clares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 168, 169.</NOTE> that <HI>all their Sermons in the Pulpit, and Pleadings
<PB N="257" REF="131">
at the Bar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 168, 169.</NOTE> <HI>consist of nothing but mean pedantry.</HI> The cen|sure is bold, especially from a man that was so far from understanding our lan|guage, that he scarce knew, <HI>Whether we move our lips,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 169.</NOTE> <HI>or no, when we speak.</HI> But to shew him, that we can bet|ter judge of <HI>Monsieur de Sor|bier's Eloquence,</HI> I must tell him, that the <HI>Muses</HI> and <HI>Parnassus</HI> are almost whip't out of our very Scholes: That there are many hun|dreds of <HI>Lawyers</HI> and <HI>Preach|ers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who have
<PB N="258" REF="132">
long known how to contemn such delicacies of his stile. I will only give one instance for all. I believe, he could scarce have Brib'd any Scriveners Clerk, to describe <HI>Hatfield</HI> as he has done, and so to conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 158.</NOTE> <HI>That the Fishes in the Ponds did often leap out of the water into the air, to behold, and to delight themselves with the beauties of that place.</HI></P>
<P>I will not attempt to de|fend the <HI>Ornaments,</HI> or the <HI>Copiousnesse</HI> of our <HI>Language,</HI> against one that <HI>is utterly
<PB N="259" REF="132">
ignorant of it.</HI> But to shew how plentifull it is, I will only repeat an observation, which the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Clarendon</HI> has made; That there is scarce any Language in the world, which can properly signify one English expressi|on, and that is <HI>Good Nature.</HI> Though <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere</HI> will not allow the <HI>Noble Au|thor</HI> of this <HI>Note, to have any skill in Grammar Learning:</HI> Yet he must pardon me, if I still believe the observati|on to be true: At least, I assure you, Sir, that after all
<PB N="260" REF="133">
my search, I cannot find any one word in his <HI>Book,</HI> which might incline me to think otherwise.</P>
<P>But I will be content to lay the whole authority of his judgement in matters of Wit, and Elegance, upon what he sayes concerning the <HI>English Books.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 168, 169.</NOTE> He af|firms, <HI>That they are only im|pudent thefts out of others, without citing their Authors, and that they contain nothing, but ill Rhapsodies of matter, worse put together.</HI> And here, Sir, I will for once do him a

courtesie. I will suppose him not to have taken this one character of us, from the <HI>Soldier,</HI> the <HI>Zealander,</HI> the <HI>Puritans,</HI> or the <HI>Rabble</HI> of the <HI>Streets</HI>: I will grant he might have taken an ill con|ceit of our writings, before he came over, from the usu|all judgement, which the Southern wits of the world, are wont to passe on the wit of all Northern Countries.

But they all three still maintain this united opi|nion, that all wit is to be sought for no where but a|mongst themselves: It is their establish'd Rule, that good sence has alwayes kept neer the warm Sun, and scarce ever yet dar'd to come farther then the forty ninth degree Northward. This, Sir, is a pretty imagination of theirs; to think they have confin'd all <HI>Art</HI> to a <HI>Geographicall Circle,</HI> and to fancy that it is there so charm'd, as not to be able
<PB N="264" REF="135">
to go out of the bounds which they have set it. It were certainly an easy and a pleasant work to confute this arrogant conception, by particular examples: It might quickly be shewn; that <HI>England, Germany, Hol|land,</HI> nay, even <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> have produc'd ve|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y many men, who may just|ly come into competition with the best of these Southern wits, in the Ad|vancement of the true Arts of life, in all the works of solid reason, nay, even in

the lighter studies of orna|ment, and humanity. And, to speak particularly of <HI>England,</HI> there might be a whole <HI>Volume</HI> compos'd in comparing the Chastity, the newnesse, the vigour of ma|ny of our <HI>English</HI> Fancies, with the corrupt, and the swelling Metaphors, where|with some of our Neighbors, who most admire themselves do still adorn their Books.

<P>But I beg your leave, Sir, that I may briefly add, That in the first Restoration of Learning, the <HI>English</HI> be|gan to write well, as soon as any, the <HI>Italians</HI> only except|ed: and that if we may

ghesse by what we see of the <HI>Italians</HI> at this day, the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> have continued to write well, longer then they. Sir <HI>Thomas Moore</HI> was contem|porary with <HI>Erasmus,</HI> and though <HI>he was a man of the Law too,</HI> yet he yielded not much to that incomparable man, in the plenty of his in|vention, or the Masculine easinesse of his stile. And e|ver since that time down to this (if we may take a mea|sure of the <HI>English,</HI> by what <HI>Tully</HI> says of the <HI>Romans,</HI> in their most flourishing con|dition,
<PB N="268" REF="137">
that <HI>they had scarce above one excellent Poet or Orator in an age</HI>) we may make a very advantagious computation, for the ho|nour of our Country. We have at this present, as ma|ny Masters of true and re|all Wit, as ever <HI>Greece</HI> pro|duc'd in one age, whose names though I conceal, yet posterity shall declare. We have had many admirable <HI>Geniuses</HI> in <HI>Poetry,</HI> who have handled most of the antient and modern subjects of fan|cy, with wonderfull success.
<PB N="269" REF="137">
We can name many faithfull and diligent <HI>Historians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 185, 186.</NOTE> such as never strove to <HI>frame a Romance out of every story, that they manag'd.</HI> And the number of these will be shortly increas'd by the la|bours of <HI>a great man,</HI> from whom we hope to receive the <HI>History</HI> of our late warrs, a subject fit for the pen of a <HI>Privy Counsellor to Kings,</HI> who had himself a great share in the conduct of these affairs which he is to relate. Our <HI>Mathematicians</HI> we may al|most equall to those of all

<HI>Europe</HI> besides: Our <HI>Physi|cians</HI> have long bin ap|plauded by all the Learned world; and certainly their <HI>Renowned Colledge</HI> at <HI>London</HI> deserv'd to have bin men|tioned, as well as the <HI>Fen|cers</HI> at the <HI>Red-Bull.</HI> Our famous <HI>Divines</HI> have been innumerable, as the <HI>Dutch|men</HI> may witnesse, who, in some of their Theologicall Treatises, have bin as bold with the <HI>English Sermons,</HI> as with our Fishing, and their robberies have bin so mani|fest, that our Church ought
<PB N="271" REF="138">
to have Reprisalls against them as well as our Mer|chants. We have had ma|ny <HI>Philosophers,</HI> of a strong, vigorous, and forcible judg|ment, of happy and labori|ous hands, of a sincere, a modest, a solid, an unaffect|ed expression, such who have not thought it enough to set up for Philosophers, only to have got a large stock of fine words, and to have insinuated into the acquaintance of some of the great Philosophers of the age. And above all, we
<PB N="272" REF="139">
have one small Book, which we dare oppose to all the Treasures of the <HI>Eastern,</HI> and <HI>Western</HI> Languages, it is that which was written by our Late <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Martyr</HI>: Whose Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">estical stile, and Divine Conceptions, have not only moved all his Readers to admire his Elo|quence, but inclin'd some of the worst of his enemies, to relent their Cruelty to|wards him.</P>
<P>After all these signs of his excellent judgment, and generous mind, there still,
<PB N="273" REF="139">
Sir, remains that which he has given of his <HI>good Palat, For he has boldly determin'd the controversie, that had long depended in all the Kitchings of England, and France, which is the best way of eating, Chines of Beef, and Mutton, or Bisques, and Potages.</HI> This, I confesse, was a mat|ter fit to be decided by that <HI>Historian, Critick, Mathe|matician, Orator,</HI> and <HI>Phy|sitian,</HI> Who had <HI>Travell'd throughout the world to ac|quaint himselfe with all the Learned men of all countries,
<PB N="274" REF="140">
and to push on all Sciences to perfection.</HI> He has here in|deed behav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d himselfe like the true naturall, and expe|rimental Philosopher, whose businesse it is to take in all manner of observations, that can be got from the Senses. You see, Sir, how fairly I treat him, I allow the ve|ry Criticisms of his appe|tite to be a part of his Phi|losophy; and I look upon his affection to <HI>Fricacies</HI> before <HI>whole Ioynts,</HI> to pro|ceed from his love to the Doctrine of <HI>Atoms,</HI> before
<PB N="275" REF="140">
that of the two great stand|ing dishes of <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form.</HI> But yet I must tell him, that perhaps this Rigid condemning of the <HI>English Cookery,</HI> did not so well suit with his belov'd Title of <HI>Sceptick.</HI> According to the lawes of that profession, he should first have long debated whether there be any tast, or no; whether the steam of a pot be only a fancy, or a reall thing; whether the Kitchin fire has indeed the good qualities of rosting, and Boiling,
<PB N="276" REF="141">
or whether it be only an appearance. This had bin a dispute more becomming a <HI>Sceptick,</HI> then thus to con|clude Dogmatically on all the <HI>Intrigues</HI> of <HI>Haut gousts</HI>; and to raise an endlesse spe|culative quarrel between those that had bin hitherto peaceful and practical <HI>Sects,</HI> the <HI>Hashe's,</HI> and the <HI>Sur|loiners.</HI></P>
<P>You may now, Sir, per|haps expect, that I should make some Comparison be|tween the <HI>French Dyet</HI> and the <HI>English.</HI> It were, I con|fess,
<PB N="277" REF="141">
a pleasant, and a weigh|ty argument. But I am resolv'd to passe it over: not that I think we have the worst of the cause; but for a particular reason of my own. It is that <HI>Monsieur de Sorbiere</HI> may still remain in his error; For as long as he is ignorant that there is any good <HI>House Keeping</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> we are like to have no more of his com|pany; yet I cannot but say to the advantage of <HI>Boil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Beef</HI> and <HI>Rost,</HI> that the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> have the same sincerity
<PB N="278" REF="142">
in their <HI>Dyet,</HI> which they have in their <HI>Manners</HI>: and as they have less mixture in their <HI>Dishes,</HI> so they have less sophisticate composi|tions in their <HI>hearts,</HI> then the people of some other <HI>Nations.</HI></P>
<P>But now, Sir, I confesse he has quite tyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d my hand, and I almost asham'd to behold this heap of his va|nities arise to such a Bulk, as he ought to be, that he has given me this occasion to collect them; I will there|fore in few words come to

an issue with him: I will satisfie him in the request which he makes to this Reader. I am content <HI>to conclude from these his three moneths travells, what kind of Observations he has made in the world these thirty years.</HI> This, Sir, is his own desire, and I obey him. But then I know not how he will be able to avoid the imputa|tion of those Crimes with which he has so often slan|dered the <HI>English,</HI> of be|ing a <HI>Doe-little,</HI> an <HI>Idle,</HI> a <HI>Lazy,</HI> and a <HI>Vseless</HI> Per|son.

The description of his <HI>Voyage into Holland</HI> is not yet come to my hands: but if it be of the same thread with this, he had bin much better imploy'd, if he had only imitated the <HI>Roman Emperours</HI> journey thither, and <HI>gone to gather Cockle-shells on that shore.</HI> If he has any <HI>friends amongst all the learned men of Europe, that were once his familiars,</HI> they would do well to ad|vise him what weight his mind will bear: he is himself in the right, when he ac|knowledges,
<PB N="281" REF="143">
that <HI>these mat|ters of state,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ep. De.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Characters of Nations, descriptions of Go|vernments, Churches, and Courts, are far above the weakness of his Spirit.</HI> But yet the Mans abilities are not wholy to be discourag'd; he may still prove a tole|rable good flatterer of his Patrons: he may bring in his <HI>Vostre Tres Humble,</HI> arti|ficially enough in the end of an empty Letter of com|plements: he may serve to commend Philosophers when they are dead: or
<PB N="282" REF="144">
(to conclude with his own dear Epithete) he may make a sufficient <HI>Trumpeter</HI> in the Common-wealth of Learning. And in truth he has behav'd himself, in this <HI>account of his Voyage,</HI> like a true <HI>Trumpeter</HI>; for <HI>Trum|peters,</HI> when they are sent in|to forein armies or coun|tries, are alwayes blinded on purpose that they might not be able to give any certain intelligence, of the places through which they pass'd.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, having dis|miss'd
<PB N="283" REF="144">
the <HI>Historiographer Royal,</HI> that I may speedily put an end to your trouble, I will only in few words ap|ply my speech to your self. You may perhaps remem|ber, that we have sometimes debated together, what place and time of all the past, or present, we would have chosen to live in, if our fates had bin at our own disposal; and in that discourse, in|steed of <HI>desiring to have bin born in China,</HI> we both a|greed, that <HI>Rome,</HI> in the <HI>Reign</HI> of <HI>Augustus,</HI> was to be pre|ferr'd
<PB N="284" REF="145">
before all others. The prerogatives of that time were very many: That <HI>City</HI> was then become the esta|blish'd seat of the <HI>Empire</HI> of the world: that <HI>Emperour</HI> had the good fortune to succeed a long civil war: the minds of all men were easily compos'd into obe|dience by the remembrance of their past misfortunes: the arts of Wit, Reason, and delight were in their high|est perfection: the Court was the place of resort, for all the Lovers of gene|rous
<PB N="285" REF="145">
knowledge: and such was the freedome of their manners, that <HI>Virgil, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Varius</HI> were admitted into the privacies, and friendship, of <HI>Agrippa, Me|caenas,</HI> and <HI>Augustus.</HI> Be|yond this we could fancy nothing pleasanter to a Philosophical mind; which was resolv'd to live accord|ing to the convenience, and Rules of Nature, see|ing it might there have in|joy'd at once all the varie|ties of an active life, and all the quiet, and peace, of a Retir'd.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="146">This, Sir, was then our opinion: But it was be|fore the <HI>Kings Return.</HI> For since that blessed time, the condition of our owne Countrey appears to me to be such, that we need not search into antient <HI>Histo|ry</HI> for a reall Idea of hap|pinesse. 'Tis true that <HI>England</HI> is not the seat of the Empire of the world: But it may be of that which confines the world it self, the Ocean: To this Domi|nion our Nation is invited, by the Scituation of our
<PB N="287" REF="146">
shores, the inclination of our people, and the Genius of a vigorous and skilfull <HI>Prince.</HI> The time where|in we live is upon the reco|very of an Universal peace; a peace establish'd on the two surest foundations of Fear, and Love: a peace that was accomplish'd with|out proscriptions, and e|ven without the ruine of those that resisted it: a peace that was produc'd by peaceful Arts, though it was by the conduct of an Army. The footsteps of
<PB N="288" REF="147">
the late dreadfull war are not only vanish'd from our eies, but now almost from our thoughts. If any thing of it still remains, it is only the good effect which it had on our coun|trey, the industry that was excited by it, and the wis|dome which such wofull experience has taught us. The Government which we injoy, is justly compos'd of a sufficient liberty, and restraint. And though it may be suspected in a que|rulous and discontented
<PB N="289" REF="147">
Age, a little to incline the people to disobedi|ence; yet in a calme, and a secure time (such as this at present) it serves admirably well to breed a generous, an ho|nourable, and invincible spirit. The temper of the <HI>English</HI> is free, Modest, Sincere, Kind, hard to be provok'd: if they are not so talkative as others, yet they are more care|full of what they speak: if they are thought, by some of their neighbours,
<PB N="90" REF="148">
to be a little defective in the gentleness, and the pliableness of their humour; yet that want is abundant|ly supplyed, by their firme and their Masculine virtues: and perhaps the same observation may be found true in men, which is in Mettals, that those of the strongest, and the Noblest substance are hardest to be polisht. The Arts that now pre|vail amongst us, are not only all the usefull Sci|ences of Antiquity, but
<PB N="291" REF="148">
most especially all the late discoveries of this Age in the reall knowledge of mankind, and nature. For the improvement of this kind of light, the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> disposition is of all others the fittest. And an universal zeal towards the advancement of such de|signs, has not only over|spread our <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Vni|versities</HI>; but the Shops of our Mechanicks, the fields of our Gentlemen, the Cottages of our Far|mers, and the Ships of
<PB N="292" REF="149">
our Merchants. To all this, Sir, may be added the Profession of such a <HI>Religion,</HI> and the Disci|pline of such a <HI>Church,</HI> which an impartial Phi|losopher would chuse: which by falling with the <HI>Throne,</HI> and by rising with it again, has given evident signe, how con|sistent it is with the Laws of humane society, and how neerly its interest is united with the prosperity of our Country.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed that
<PB N="293" REF="149">
after all these advantages, there may be some room still left for future amend|ments, in the union of our minds, the smooth|ness of our manners, and the Beauty of our Build|ings. This last was the peculiar honour of <HI>Au|gustus,</HI> who is said <HI>to have found Rome of Brick, and to have left it of Marble.</HI> In this kind too we every day behold a wonderful progress, by the power|full influence of a <HI>Roy|al Example:</HI> so that I
<PB N="294" REF="150">
may in generall affirm, that never any Nation in the world has pro|ceeded by swifter de|grees, to excell in Con|venience and Magni|ficence. But whatever is to be added in this, or any other such way, we can never receive it from the petulant cor|rections of such vain Ob|servers, as this whom I have here consider'd. No, Sir, we are to ex|pect it from the many Noble and practicall <HI>Eng|lish</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="150">
Wits of this Age: and chiefly from your self. For you must give me leave, Sir, to pre|sage, that to you your Country is to owe very much of its Ornament, as well as experimental knowledge, its reputation and indeed all the li|ving, and Beneficial Arts, the enlargement of their Bounds. This, Sir, I know will offend your modesty; but he is an ill <HI>English-man,</HI> who would not have said as much
<PB N="296" REF="151">
as this, when your name was mentioned: which if I had omitted, I had bin almost as injurious to our Nation, as this very <HI>Traveller</HI> whom I censure: for as he was un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ust in aggravating the faults, so I my selfe had been, in concealing one of the principall glories of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I beg of you now, Sir, only to permit me to conclude with some Apo|logy for my self. You may, perhaps, wonder all
<PB N="297" REF="151">
this while to see me un|dertake such an argument, and to prosecute it in a manner, which may ap|pear perhaps a little too sharp for your eye, or my pen. You know, Sir, that I am enemy to all manner of controversies, that I hate contention, though in matters of the greatest concernment, and that I had much rather de|fend, then accuse: To this I can therefore only reply, for my excuse, that this <HI>Letter</HI> may not so properly
