<P>IT had been a matter of no great
difficulty to have pre&s;ented
you, in&s;tead of this &s;hort E&s;&s;ay,
with a large Volume, if I had
either affected or de&s;igned, when I
fir&s;t took my pen in hand, to have
written a full history of the Reli|gion,
Manners and Government of
the <HI>Turks,</HI> or had tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ght fit to
have &s;tuffed the&s;e M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">moires with
accompts of things trivial and com|mon,
which have been &s;aid too often
already and which are to be met
with in every little Relation. But
I was not in the lea&s;t tempted to
&s;uch a piece of vanity and o&s;tenta|tion:
<PB REF="4">
and indeed I thought it very
much beneath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ne to do this; e&s;pe|cially
when I reflected I was wri|ting
Letters to an <HI>Excellent Per&s;on,</HI>
who by his &s;tudies and travels, and
many honourable employments both
at home and in forrain parts had ac|quired
a perfect knowledge of the
state of affairs, not only of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI>
but al&s;o of all other remoter
Countries; and who de&s;erved to be
treated with greater re&s;pect and ce|remony,
by me e&s;pecially, that owe
the opportunity I gained of travelling
into the <HI>Levant</HI> to his mo&s;t obliging
and effectual recommendation. So that
brevity was my choice, and I was of|tentimes
more &s;ollicitous and concer|ned
to con&s;ider what not then what
to write. That I have done what
I propo&s;ed to my &s;elf, and have made
good my preten&s;ions, neither my fears
nor my mode&s;ty will permit me to
be over-confident: But I have this,
I will not &s;ay to ju&s;tifie, but to ex|cu&s;e
at lea&s;t my pre&s;umption and for|wardne&s;s,
that if I had known the&s;e
things to have been &s;atisfactorily
<PB REF="4">
accompted for by others, I &s;hould
not have troubled either my &s;elf or
you. The&s;e accompts, which upon
my return home to <HI>Oxon</HI> I publi&s;hed
there in <HI>Latine,</HI> I am in a manner
nece&s;&s;itated to tran&s;late into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
tho with &s;ome few enlargements, to
prevent the doing of it by another,
which I had ju&s;t rea&s;on to appre|hend.
For a worthy per&s;on, who has
often conde&s;cended to this kind of
drudgery for the publick benefit,
was &s;o ju&s;t and civil, as to ask my
leave to do it; which I did not
think fit to grant: but whether for
the better or the wor&s;e I must not
&s;ay.</P>
<P>If the thread of a <HI>Church-man</HI>
be perceived to run through the
whole Relation, I hope this will be
&s;o far from being a ju&s;t exception or
prejudice to it, that it may gain
&s;ome little credit and reputation
with you upon that accompt; if
not the performance, the de&s;ign at
lea&s;t, I ea&s;ily per&s;wade my &s;elf will
not be di&s;allowed. It is not only to
gratifie your curio&s;ity, but to &s;erve
<PB REF="5">
you in better and nobler ends;
whereof this is the chiefest, that
being more and more convinced by
&s;uch kind of relations, of the bruti&s;h
ignorance and horrid barbarou&s;ne&s;s
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and of the dotages
and follies of their wor&s;hip, you may
the more thankfully and &s;eriou&s;ly re|flect
upon that most ble&s;&s;ed and mer|ciful
providence, which has ca&s;t
your lot in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and in a
Countrey e&s;pecially, where the <HI>Chri|&s;tian
Doctrine</HI> is profest in its pri|mitive
purity and integrity, and
where civility and learning, and all
ingenuous Arts flouri&s;h, and are in
their heigth and perfection.</P>
<P>The accompt of my voyage to the
<HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> all but the begin|ing
and end, I wrote in <HI>Smyrna</HI> out
of my Diary, for the &s;atisfaction of
my fellow-travellers, who were plea|&s;ed
to demand Copies of me. And I
hope what I have done in this kind
will not in the lea&s;t hinder any of
tho&s;e worthy and ingenious per&s;ons,
who have made the &s;ame <HI>tour</HI> before
or &s;ince, from publi&s;hing their Jour|nals:
<PB REF="5">
this argument being capable
of continual enlargements, e&s;peci|ally
in the matter of <HI>In&s;criptions.</HI>
This would be of very great advan|tage
to learning, of which there can|not
po&s;&s;ibly be a greater proof than
in tho&s;e marbles which were
brought out of <HI>Greece,</HI> and the <HI>le&s;&s;er
Asia</HI> at the expence of that great
man, <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and
which by the mo&s;t generous favour
of the illu&s;trious, <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of
<HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>Earl Mar&s;hal,</HI> now
&s;erve to adorn the <HI>area</HI> about the
<HI>Theater</HI> at <HI>Oxon:</HI> and e&s;pecially the
<HI>Parian</HI> marble, which contains the
mo&s;t famous Epochas of the ancient
<HI>Greeks,</HI> by the help of which many
difficulties in <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Chronolo|gy</HI>
have been cleared; as Mr. <HI>Selden,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Lydiat,</HI> the right Reverend and
mo&s;t profoundly learned, the pre&s;ent
<HI>Lord Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;ht
<HI>Sir John Mar&s;ham,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Prideaux,</HI> the learned Publi&s;her
of the <HI>Marmora Oxonien&s;ia</HI> have
&s;hewn in &s;everal instances. And of
what great u&s;e &s;everal other in&s;crip|tions
<PB REF="6">
are, for the adju&s;ting and
&s;ettling the accompts of time, and
rectifying the <HI>Fa&s;ti Con&s;ulares,</HI> will
better appear, when the Reverend
and mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly learned Doctor
<HI>William Lloyd</HI> Dean of <HI>Bangor</HI> &s;hall
think fit to publi&s;h tho&s;e things of
this kind, which he has been plea&s;ed to
&s;hew me in his Collections. An in|credible
number of marbles &s;till re|main
behind in tho&s;e parts, and
others are continually dug up, (the
erecting of the&s;e having been former|ly
the pride and gallantry of the
<HI>Greeks</HI>) and what might be pur|cha&s;ed
upon no very hard terms, if
&s;ome excellent per&s;ons would be at
the expence of enriching their Coun|trey
with the &s;poils of the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> I
have often lamented the mi&s;fortune,
which drove me from <HI>Hierapolis</HI>
after the &s;hort &s;tay of two or three
hours, where I believe I could have
employed my &s;elf for a week or fort|night
to very good purpo&s;e: and that
neither my nece&s;&s;ary attendance npon
the Amba&s;&s;ador and the Nation, nor
my &s;mall &s;tock of money afterward,
<PB REF="6">
when I was at liberty, would per|mit
me to travel to <HI>Nice, Nicome|dia,
Ancyra, Iconium,</HI> and &s;everal
other places, where I heard were
numerous and famous ruines;
but e&s;pecially to <HI>Monte Santo,</HI> as
they call <HI>Mount Athos,</HI> to look af|ter
<HI>Greek Manu&s;cripts.</HI> But I hope
other Travellers will be more fortu|nate,
and better encouraged than I
have been, and will one day make
the world happy with their di&s;co|veries,
and receive the reward of
their generous adventures and un|dertakings,
when <HI>God</HI> &s;hall re&s;tore
them to their native Countrey.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I have added a &s;hort de|&s;cription
of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which
I readily acknowledge to be far
from accurate and perfect, not de|signing
in the lea&s;t, when I was
upon the place, to have done any
&s;uch thing; and therefore I content|ed
my &s;elf only to put down &s;ome
&s;hort notices to relieve my memory.
I &s;oon was made &s;en&s;ible, by pa&s;&s;ing
up and down the &s;treets of that great
City, that the &s;cite and &s;celeton, if I
<PB REF="7">
may u&s;e the word, of the ancient
buildings only remains, the beauty
and glory of them being lo&s;t, &s;ince
the <HI>Turks</HI> became Masters of it:
And as when I was at the <HI>Churches</HI>
(an idea of which they may ea&s;ily
have, who have &s;een the Abbey of
<HI>Gla&s;tenbury</HI> or <HI>Thetford,</HI> or will
but call to mind the deplorable ru|ines
of <HI>London</HI> after the di&s;mal fire)
&s;o when I con&s;idered the pre&s;ent &s;tate
and condition of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I
was oftentimes perplext and in
doubt, whether I was more to ad|mire
the piety and munificence of
tho&s;e, who rai&s;ed &s;uch &s;tately and
glorious &s;tructures, or the bruti&s;h|ne&s;s
and barbarou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e, who
pulled them down. But I &s;oon laid
my hand upon my mouth, when I
further con&s;idered, that &s;acriledge
had done the like to &s;everal goodly
hou&s;es of Religion and Learning in
<HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and that it was wholly
owing to the miraculous providence
of <HI>God,</HI> who laid a re&s;traint upon
the mad and impious zeal of &s;ome
of the prevailing faction in the late
<PB REF="7">
times of u&s;urpation, (when the re|venue
of the Church became a prey
to their covetou&s;ne&s;&s;) that the <HI>Ca|thedrals,</HI>
which are the wonder of
all ingenious forrainers, and one of
the &s;tanding glorys of <HI>England,</HI> had
not been laid wa&s;t and levelled
with the ground, and turned into
confu&s;ed heaps of &s;tone and rubbi&s;h,
like <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> or <HI>Laodecea.</HI> A reflexion
upon which &s;ad times &s;hould make us
dete&s;t tho&s;e &s;editious and fanatical
principles, which if they &s;hould once
prevail, and be received as good
<HI>Chri&s;tian Doctrine,</HI> as they were
mo&s;t unhappily not many years &s;ince,
we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear they
would bring as great de&s;olations
along with them as any that are
now in <HI>Turkey.</HI></P>

<P>_THE <HI>Turks</HI> are ju&s;tly

renders nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;en|tial
to their Government; or to
want of Di&s;cipline, for that in mo&s;t
things is very exact, and agreeable
to the Laws and Rules of Polity,
which Cu&s;tom and Experience hath
e&s;tabli&s;hed as the grand &s;upport
of their Empire; or to want of ci|vil
Behaviour among them&s;elves,
for none can outwardly be more
re&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, e&s;pecially
<PB N="2" REF="9">
to their Superiors, in who&s;e power
it is to do them a mi&s;chief, the fear
of which makes them guilty of mo&s;t
ba&s;e compliances: But to the into|lerable
Pride and Scorn wherewith
they treat all the World be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Their Temper and Genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their con|tempt of Learning.</NOTE> the
Con&s;titution of their Government,
and the Principles of their Educa|tion
enclining them to War, where
Valour and Merit are &s;ure to be en|couraged,
and have their due re|ward;
They have neither lei&s;ure
nor inclination to entertain the &s;tu|dies
of Learning or the Civil Arts,
which take off the roughne&s;s and
wildne&s;s of nature, and render men
more agreeable in their conver&s;ati|on.
And though they are forced to
commend and admire the ingenuity
of the <HI>Western Chri&s;tians,</HI> when they
&s;ee any Mathematical In&s;trument,
curious Pictures, Map, or Sea-Charts,
or open the Leaves of any Printed
Book, or the like; yet they look upon
all this as a curio&s;ity, that not only
may be &s;pared, but what ought to be
carefully avoided, and kept out of
<PB N="3" REF="9">
their Empire, as tending to &s;often
mens minds, and render them le&s;s
fit for Arms, which they look upon
as the be&s;t and true&s;t end of life, to
enlarge their Greatne&s;s and their
Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o much their want

and rude to Strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hatred of all other Religions, which is</NOTE> as a rooted

hatred of all others who are of a

that where this principle pre|vails,
and is look'd upon as a piece
of Religion and Duty, they who em|brace
it &s;hould be guilty of any act
of kindne&s;s and humanity; except
when they are bribed to it with hope

<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">as al&s;o the Habit of the Country, when they travel.</NOTE> if curio&s;ity carries one

the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who&s;e valor they have

pitiful and low-spirited wretches,
who dare do nothing that is gene|rous
and brave, and worthy of men.
It is u&s;ual with them to &s;ay, 'tis mat|ter

they acknowledg as mo&s;t due
to our <HI>B. Saviour</HI>) into the hands
of &s;o vile a Nation as the <HI>Jews,</HI> to
be crucified; and therefore in com|pliance
with their gro&s;s conceptions,
which are no way capable of under|&s;tanding
the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, they
imagine, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> e&s;caped out of

<PB N="14" REF="15">
him in &s;tature and &s;hape, and the
other &s;ignatures of his body, &s;ub&s;ti|tuted
in his room, upon whom they
executed their utmo&s;t malice and
fury in putting him to &s;o ignomini|ous
a death. They call them gene|rally
by the name <HI>Gephut;</HI> which
word is corrupted from the <HI>Arabick,</HI>
and though originally it might de|note
nothing but the name of that
people, yet now they u&s;e it in a
mo&s;t di&s;graceful and ignominious
&s;en&s;e, as if there could not possibly
be a greater di&s;grace or reproach
than the bare title of a <HI>Jew;</HI> tho
&s;ometimes for merriment &s;ake, and
to &s;hew their &s;corn, they u&s;ually pre|fix
&s;ome opprobrious term or other,
to make them more contemptible
and ridiculous. But when they grow
a little more &s;erious, and recollect
them&s;elves &s;omewhat, and change
their &s;corn into anger, they will up|braid
them with their ob&s;tinacy and
in&s;idelity in rejecting and disbelie|ving
the holy <HI>Prophets</HI> &s;ent by <HI>God,</HI>
and particularly our <HI>B. Saviour,</HI>
whom they place next their fal&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="15">
Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> are
very obnoxious to the in&s;olencies of
the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who oftentimes to
make them&s;elves merry, throw and
kick them to the ground, and pull
them by the No&s;es and by the Ears.
Again&s;t which they dare not &s;o much
as open their lips, for fear the &s;port
&s;hould by the lea&s;t ill word be turn|ed
into fury and madne&s;s. And very
often, to do them the more di&s;ho|nour,
when any Criminal has recei|ved
the &s;entence of death, they pre|&s;ently
hurry him away, and make
the fir&s;t <HI>Jew,</HI> rich or poor, they can
light upon, walk with the Rope in
his hand, tyed about the neck of the
other, till they come to the next
Tree out of Town, and then hang
him. It is a great mi&s;take to think,
that the <HI>Turks</HI> admit them into their
<HI>Divans,</HI> or publick Councils, as if
they were privy to any of their de|&s;igns
they have upon <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI>
or valued their information, or
thought they could reveal the &s;e|crets
of Government u&s;ed among

<PB N="16" REF="16">
will not &s;uffer them to &s;toop &s;o low;
and the policy of the <HI>Jews</HI> in &s;uch

and ill-will; and their wit and
cunning is &s;hew'n and exerci&s;ed bet|ter
about Merchandi&s;e, and Brocage,
and Usury, wherein they do great &s;er|vice
to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who are pitiful
Accomptants; and are employed by
them in collecting their Cu&s;toms,
and the making even their accounts,
as knowing that their Talent lies
this way, and that they are crafty
and &s;ubtil in making bargains, and
under&s;tand money matters very well,
there being no <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> or &s;carce any
of fa&s;hion, who has a numerous Fa|mily,
but retains a <HI>Jew</HI> with him or
about him, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s is
to look to the expences of the Hou&s;e,
and buy all things nece&s;&s;ary, as
Cloaths, Provi&s;ions, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>Above all they retain an immor|tal
hatred of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ha|tred of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> greate&s;t.</NOTE> though
they are their Brother <HI>Mahometans,</HI>
and pay a like re&s;pect and reverence
to the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and embrace the
dotages, and follies, and impo&s;tures
<PB N="17" REF="16">
of it, with the &s;ame concern of zeal.
The original and fundamental diffe|rence
is about the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> which
the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> contend to belong to
<HI>Ali,</HI> not only in right of his Wife
<HI>Phatima,</HI> who was Daughter of <HI>Ma|homet;</HI>
and by the la&s;t Will of <HI>Ma|homet</HI>
him&s;elf, who&s;e Favourite he
was; but al&s;o upon the account of
his Valour, and other per&s;onal ex|cellencies.
Agreeable to this opinion
they have of Him and his Title,
they exclaim upon <HI>Abu Beker, Os|man,</HI>
and <HI>Omer,</HI> who were &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly
Chiefs of the new <HI>Religion,</HI> as
meer Usurpers, and as Corrupters of
the holy Text; they are one great
argument and &s;ubject of the raillery
of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Poets, who make odd
and ridiculous repre&s;entations of
them; whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> look upon
them with all po&s;&s;ible veneration,
e&s;teem them not only as the orna|ments,
but as the props and &s;up|ports
of the <HI>Mu&s;ulman</HI> faith, and
their memories are &s;o &s;acred among
them, that their names are u&s;ually
in&s;cribed upon the in&s;ide of their
<PB N="18" REF="17">
greater <HI>Mo&s;chs,</HI> as I have often took
notice of. This difference is height|ned
by different interpretations of
&s;ome ambiguous Texts in their Law,
and by the introduction of different
Rites and Ceremonies in their Reli|gious
Wor&s;hip, each fiercely accu|&s;ing
the other of perverting the mind
of their <HI>Prophet,</HI> and of innovation.
Their di&s;putes and grudges, and
mutual cen&s;ures and recriminations
have &s;ome ages &s;ince broke out into
&s;uch quarrels and feuds, that &s;eem
no way likely ever to be peiced up
and reconciled. If any di&s;course hap|pen
concerning the Religion of <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI>
the zeal wherewith the <HI>Turks</HI>
are pre&s;ently &s;et on fire, does furni&s;h
them with &s;ufficient arguments of
reproach. A <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> they will tell
you, is a de&s;ertor of the true faith,
and an Apo&s;tate; an Heretick, who
follows his own fancy, and rejects
the e&s;tablisht and ancient Ceremo|nies
of Religion; is altogether im|pure,
as neglectful of tho&s;e wa&s;hings,
which their Prophet requires as ne|ce&s;&s;ary
preparations to prayer; one
<PB N="19" REF="17">
who does not know how to &s;ay his
prayers as he ought, void of all &s;en&s;e
of the true Religion; la&s;tly, a very
<HI>Infidel, kizel ba&s;h Gaour, the Infidel
with the red head,</HI> alluding to the
<HI>Turbants</HI> or <HI>Sha&s;hes</HI> they wind about
their heads, which are u&s;ually of
that colour; whereas the colour the
<HI>Turks</HI> mo&s;t affect is white, except the
kinred and po&s;terity of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
who&s;e &s;pecial priviledge alone it is
to wear green, a colour they pretend
he mo&s;t delighted in, and u&s;ed to go
in when he was old; his name is
writ with that colour in the <HI>Alco|ran.</HI></P>
<P>However this animo&s;ity might be|gin
upon a Religious account, yet it
is mightily &s;upported by intere&s;t,
and managed with a great deal of
dexterity and cunning by the <HI>Turks,</HI>
who cheri&s;h the&s;e evil opinions and
prejudices in the minds of the peo|ple
and Souldiers, e&s;pecially again&s;t
both <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> the two
extremes of their Empire confining
upon their Territories, and &s;o ea&s;ily
either find or take frequent occa&s;ion
<PB N="20" REF="18">
to quarrel and war with both. By
the&s;e arts they work upon the minds
of the Souldiers to a greater willing|ne&s;s
of undergoing the hard&s;hips of
war. With this politick Engine they
thru&s;t them upon any de&s;ign, though
never &s;o unlikely or de&s;perate. For
who is &s;o cowardly and faint-heart|ed,
or &s;o much in love with life, as
not to venture the lo&s;s of it in the
cau&s;e of Religion, when the true
Faith either is in danger, or is to be
propagated; when they take up
Arms to cha&s;tize and puni&s;h Here|ticks
and Apo&s;tates; when they fight
for <HI>God,</HI> and the advancement of his
cau&s;e again&s;t the profe&s;t Enemies of
it? This per&s;wasion in&s;pires them with
de&s;perate and bruti&s;h valour, when
they turn their faces upon <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom;</HI>
as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;hew
hereafter. And the &s;ame argument
they u&s;e as &s;ucce&s;&s;fully, when rea&s;on of
State or ambition oblige them to
make a War in <HI>Asia;</HI> a famous in|&s;tance
of which we have in the ta|king
of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> in the year of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
1638, by that warlike Emperor <HI>Mo|rat,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="18">
who was pre&s;ent there in per|&s;on,
and not long after died of ex|ce&s;&s;ive
drinking of Wine, to the great
joy of <HI>Poland,</HI> which he threatned
to invade with his well-di&s;ciplin'd
Troops, full fle&s;h'd with blood, en|raged
to revenge the affront and dis|grace
of his Brother <HI>Osman.</HI> For as
&s;oon as an expedition into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>

in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> the <HI>Church-men</HI> had
orders to &s;ound the alarum in their
Pulpits, for the better animating and
encouraging the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> who
otherwi&s;e would have had no very
great mind to it. And they perform|ed
their part mighty well by their
popular and furious preachments,
telling them over and over, that the
<HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had made a defection from
the true Faith; that they had per|verted
the &s;en&s;e of the Divine Law,
by their wicked and fal&s;e interpre|tations
and glo&s;&s;es; and how highly
they would de&s;erve of the great <HI>God</HI>
of Heaven and Earth, of <HI>Mahomet</HI>
his Prophet and Apo&s;tle, and of the
whole <HI>Mu&s;ulman</HI> Religion, if they
<PB N="22" REF="19">
would fight &s;toutly. Every <HI>Mo&s;ch</HI>
rung with zealous exhortations to
fight for the cau&s;e of <HI>God,</HI> and the
Souldiers longed to be at it before
the time. And to keep firm their
good re&s;olutions, the <HI>Mufti,</HI> who&s;e
&s;entence and determination they re|vere

circumci&s;e Children in their infancy,

wholly to their liberty, and to con|&s;ult
their convenience, &s;o it be not

which is the utmo&s;t limit, (that is,
if they be not deprived of an op|portunity

alledg agreeably to the holy Scrip|tures,
was done when he was at that
age. Till which time the Boys wear
their Hair long, but made up into
curled knots hanging over their
Shoulders. The Ceremony is per|form'd
with great noi&s;e and tumult,

mirth; all their &s;olemnities being
di&s;orderly and rude, and without
any decorum or di&s;cretion to ma|nage
them. The whole day is &s;pent
in entertaining their Relations and
Neighbours, who are to be witne&s;&s;es

the bu&s;ine&s;s, which is committed to

the Boy is brought in by his Father

Turbant, whom they flatter and ca|re&s;s
to divert him from melancholy
and fear, and to prevent him from
fainting before he feels the &s;harpne&s;s

they think he has not courage e|nough
to endure it; or do it by a
&s;urprize, before he is aware, having
fir&s;t prepared all things in order to
it, and then making as if it were to
be deferred till the next day, quick|ly
return and fini&s;h the intended
work. Yet notwith&s;tanding the great
&s;tir they have made in the day-time,
and that by this they are initiated
<PB N="41" REF="28">

to have any &s;olemn prayers at it;

contracted &s;uch a dearne&s;s and

of pain (I intend it only of the

great duties of Nature, which refer
to the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God,
as if in this they were to out-do both
<HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> For they are
obliged to make their &s;olemn pray|ers
five times a day, at &s;et hours;
which vary according to the diffe|rent
&s;ea&s;ons of the year. They do
not divide the natural day into &s;o
many equal portions, as not under|&s;tanding
the u&s;e of Aequinoctial
hours, or the benefit of Sun Dials,
to mea&s;ure and adju&s;t their time;

but only have regard to the ri&s;ing
and &s;etting of the Sun, and its lon|ger
or &s;horter &s;tay above the Hori|zon;
though of later years they
are mightily taken with the inven|tion
of Watches, there being &s;carce
a <HI>Turk</HI> in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> of any fa&s;hi|on,
but is ma&s;ter of one, and be|&s;ides
has a &s;triking Clock in his
Hou&s;e; a con&s;iderable number of
Artizans of the <HI>French</HI> Nation reap|ing
good advantage from this their
curio&s;ity. The times are at Sun|ri&s;ing,
Noon, the Middle-time be|tween
Noon and Sun &s;et, Sun-set,
and an hour and half in the Night;
only upon <HI>Friday,</HI> which they call
<HI>Giumahgun,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday their day of Religious Conventi|on.</NOTE> or the day of their Re|ligious
Convention, they add to their
devotion, and go to Church about
the middle of the Forenoon; at
which time the more devout &s;hut
up their Shops, but afterwards re|turn
to their trade and bu&s;ine&s;s.
This being the only di&s;tinction and
&s;olemnity of the day, and no other
reverence paid it. Otherwi&s;e there
is the &s;ame noi&s;e in the Streets and
<PB N="45" REF="30">
Markets, the &s;ame chaffering of wares,
their Magazines as much frequented,
and no difference as to the neatne&s;s
and finene&s;s of their Habit; they
thinking they have done enough,
if they &s;tep to the <HI>Mo&s;ch</HI> at that pe|culiar
time for a quarter of an hour.
In the time of <HI>Ramazan,</HI> which is
the mo&s;t &s;olemn time of the whole
year, wherein they pretend to mo&s;t
devotion, and wherein the mo&s;t care|le&s;s
will endeavour to expiate the
mi&s;carriages of the year pa&s;t, &s;ome
will ri&s;e two hours before day to
prai&s;e the name of God in a &s;et form,
this being a holy month, devoted to
fa&s;ting and the more &s;trict exerci&s;es
of Religion. In the greate&s;t <HI>Mo&s;chs</HI>
on Friday in the Afternoon, &s;uch of
the Prie&s;ts as have acquired the fame
of Learning and Eloquence, enlarge|ing
upon &s;ome words of the <HI>Alco|ran,</HI>
entertain the people with ha|rangues
in their way, with a great
deal of noi&s;e and &s;eeming zeal, tend|ing
to the advance of Piety, Ju&s;tice,
Charity, and the other vertues of
conver&s;ation and &s;ociety. But this
<PB N="46" REF="31">
is extraordinary, which they are not
bound to, their part being to read
&s;everal Surats or Chapters of the
<HI>Alcoran,</HI> and recite the pre&s;cribed
office of Prayer: A little &s;tock of
Learning &s;erving to qualifie them
for this function.</P>
<P>Before they make their prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their wa&s;hings.</NOTE>
whether publickly in their <HI>Mo&s;chs,</HI>
or privately in their Hou&s;es, they
are very &s;olicitous to wa&s;h them|&s;elves,
as thinking, that without this
previous lu&s;tration <HI>God</HI> will be deaf
to their reque&s;ts, and that all their
devotion will be ineffectual and to
no purpo&s;e. This being &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry
a qualification of prayer, that
they might not be de&s;titute of con|veniencies,
and &s;o be forced to omit
their devotion for want of due pre|paration
this way, be&s;ides the va&s;t
number of them every-where in their
Streets, there are Conduits and Foun|tains
with great variety of Cocks
adjoining to the greater <HI>Mo&s;chs</HI> for
this purpo&s;e. It is not enough to
wa&s;h them&s;elves, except they do it
after a particular manner, which
<PB N="47" REF="31">
though difficult in it &s;elf, yet cu&s;tom
and u&s;e have rendred &s;o ea&s;ie and
familiar to them, that they do it
without delay and without error;
the manner is this, as I made a <HI>Turk,</HI>
whom I had oblig'd, &s;hew me parti|cularly
in my Chamber. Tucking
up their Ve&s;ts and &s;hort Sleeves a|bove
their Elbows, they take up as
much water as they can hold in the
hollow of their hands, which they
wa&s;h thrice, and then putting their
forefinger inro the left &s;ide of their
mouth, and their Thumb into the
right, wa&s;h that three times al&s;o.
Snuffling up water with their No|&s;trils,
they gently &s;troke their Face
from the Forehead to the Chin, and
back again; next their Arms to the
bending; taking off their Turbant
they rub with the in&s;ide of their
Hand the forepart of their Head,
from the Crown to the Forehead, put|ting
their fore and middle Finger into
the cavities of their Ears, and their
Thumbs behind, wa&s;hing their Necks
with three Fingers of both Hands
rever&s;ed. Their publick <HI>Bagnos</HI> or
<PB N="48" REF="32">
Baths u&s;ually are built very hand|&s;om
and &s;tately; all great men have
them in their Hou&s;es for their own
u&s;e, and the u&s;es of their Women,
being frequented not only for health
and cleanline&s;s, but for Religion in
&s;everal particular ca&s;es, in which
they are obliged to clean&s;e other
parts of the Body, not to be named,
which yet I have &s;een them do at an
open Fountain in the Streets. This
ceremony, be their occa&s;ions never
&s;o great and urgent, they cannot
omit without great &s;candal and guilt.
Before which purgation they look
upon them&s;elves as unfit not only
to go to Church, but to conver&s;e or
to be conver&s;ed with. But how &s;hall
&s;uch as travel in the De&s;arts of <HI>A|rabia</HI>
or <HI>Libya</HI> comply with this
fundamental Article of <HI>Mahometi&s;m,</HI>
where they cannot be profu&s;e with
the provi&s;ions of water they carry
with them for the nece&s;&s;ities of life,
where they meet with no Springs to
&s;upply them&s;elves? Are they wholly
freed from the obligation of pray|er?
No. The &s;ubtle Impo&s;tor has
<PB N="49" REF="32">
herein provided a remedy again&s;t
this contingence; in ca&s;e of the
faileur of water, Sand or Ashes or a
Morter-clod crumbled into du&s;t &s;hall
do as well, and &s;hall convey the
&s;ame clean&s;ing virtue, as much as
if they had made u&s;e of the cleare&s;t
Fountain-water. They u&s;e cold wa|ter,
except in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s and
weakne&s;s, when they are indulged
to warm it, for fear otherwi&s;e the
cold &s;hould &s;trike into their bodies
and encrea&s;e their malady. But &s;ee
the madne&s;s and folly of their &s;uper|&s;tition!
by the &s;prinkling of a few
drops of cold water, they think their
minds are as much purified as their
bodies, and that this is a &s;ufficient
purgation from the defilements of
&s;in, and a mo&s;t effectual remedy a|gain&s;t
brutality, and the mo&s;t hor|rid
impieties they can po&s;&s;ibly be
guilty of.</P>
<P>To put them in mind the better
of the&s;e duties of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Called to Prayers by the Prie&s;ts or their Servants&punc;</NOTE> that nei|ther

better accommodation, about the
<HI>Menar</HI> or Pyramid rai&s;ed from the

built a Gallery, to which there is an
a&s;cent by a winding pair of Stairs,
the door whereof always looks to|wards
<HI>Mecca.</HI> Here walking round
and &s;training their voices in a kind
of &s;inging tone, which they lengthen
out, they invite them in a peculiar
form of words, which is common to
all, and from which they do not
depart a tittle, to come and make
their prayers; and by this way they
&s;upply the want of Bells, which they
neither u&s;e them&s;elves, nor permit
the poor <HI>Greeks.</HI> It is &s;carce cre|dible
how this noi&s;e, by rea&s;on of
this advantage of heigth, in a clear
evening may be di&s;tinctly heard. The
words are exactly the&s;e; <HI>God is
great, God is great; there is no
God but God, there is no God but
God; I confe&s;s that</HI> Mahomet <HI>is
the Me&s;&s;enger of God, I confe&s;s that</HI>
Mahomet <HI>is the Me&s;&s;enger of God;
<PB N="51" REF="33">
come to prayers, come to prayers;
come to wor&s;hip, come to wor&s;hip;
God is great, God is great; there
is no God but God.</HI> In the morning
&s;ometimes they remind them, that
<HI>prayer is better than &s;leep,</HI> and bid
them repeat the <HI>Phatiha</HI> or fir&s;t
Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which they
u&s;e as frequently as we do the <HI>Lords
Prayer.</HI> In the <HI>Royal Mo&s;chs,</HI> where
there are u&s;ually four Pyramids,

the frequent mixture of <HI>Arabick</HI>
words in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> does not a lit|tle
conduce. The matter of them is

generally pious, and what might
not mi&s;become tho&s;e who wor&s;hip

it from thee, O Lord, what the
Chri&s;tians impute to thee;</HI> meaning,
that <HI>thou ha&s;t a Son.</HI> The&s;e prayers,
as &s;everal other parts of their wor|&s;hip,
have for their foundation not
only the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> in which, as they
&s;peak, are contained the commands
of <HI>God,</HI> but the practice and exam|ple
of <HI>Mahomet</HI> derived down to
them by tradition, which they call
<HI>Sunna.</HI> By which pretence they have
introduced &s;everal cu&s;toms, though
in matters of le&s;s moment, of which
there is not the lea&s;t intimation in
the Book of their Law; and the
people, out of a blind reverence and
ignorant zeal, e&s;teem them to have
the &s;ame authority and to be equal|ly
binding. They direct their pray|ers
only to <HI>God</HI> Almighty, acknow|ledging
<PB N="53" REF="34">
his infinite power, &s;overaign|ty,
and right over Angels and Men
and Devils, and the whole compre|hen&s;ion
of all other Beings. They
put up no prayers to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> nor
do they bow their knees, as ever I
could ob&s;erve, as &s;ome write, at the
mention of his name, it being one
of their principles, that <HI>God</HI> is only
to be adored and wor&s;hipped, which
makes them &s;o &s;evere upon us, ar|raigning
us of Idolatry for wor&s;hip|ping

for ever; Ariani&s;m,</HI> which <HI>Maho|met</HI>
learned of the Monk <HI>Sergius,</HI>

Religion. In what a fair way are a

(e&s;pecially inferior per&s;ons, who are
taught to renounce the <HI>Lord God
their Saviour, who bought them</HI>)
in <HI>Poland</HI> and el&s;ewhere, to become
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> if the <HI>Grand Signor</HI>
&s;hould enlarge his conque&s;ts among
them, which <HI>God</HI> avert for the good
of <HI>Chri&s;tendom!</HI> Only as to what
concerns <HI>Mahomet,</HI> they wi&s;h <HI>God</HI>
would be propitious to him and his

of whom their writers take
up the &s;ame form, joining the name
of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Virgin</HI> to his, as <HI>Isa

peace.</HI> They do <HI>Mahomet</HI> no other
honour in their offices of Prayer,
be&s;ides frequent acknowledgments
of his mi&s;&s;ion from <HI>God</HI> as his Apo|&s;tle
and Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>There is a great &s;emblance of de|votion
in their Churches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pub|lick Service in their <HI>Mo&s;chs.</HI></NOTE> This is
the only repre&s;entation that can be

clo&s;e to the brea&s;t, almo&s;t in the fi|gure

lea&s;t motion, as if they were in an

have made nece&s;&s;ary in order

folly and weakne&s;s not to cen&s;ure
others of gro&s;s and ridiculous folly
and di&s;&s;imulation, as this follow|ing
in&s;tance will fully demon&s;trate:
My Lord Amba&s;&s;ador one day enter|tain'd
at Dinner one <HI>Hu&s;ain Aga,</HI>
who had formerly been Cu&s;tomer
at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and at that time one of
the great men of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by
rea&s;on of the relation that his Father-in-Law
had to the <HI>Vizir</HI> then in
<HI>Candia,</HI> but as very a <HI>Turk</HI> as is in
the whole Empire, together with five
other Hogs fatning up for the &s;laugh|ter.
They drank mighty freely of
Wine and Strong-water, which had
been di&s;tilled in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> for the
&s;ake of which they chiefly came;
though they would je&s;tingly at Ta|ble
check them&s;elves for daring to
tran&s;gre&s;s the Law of their <HI>Pro|phet:</HI>
But being once in, they drank
<PB N="61" REF="38">
on, a drop of each defiling them as
much as the greate&s;t load they could
&s;tand under. But however, to &s;hew
that for all this extravagance they
were <HI>Mu&s;ulmans,</HI> as &s;oon as they
heard the Prie&s;t from the Spire of
a neighbouring <HI>Mo&s;ch</HI> at <HI>Ikindi,</HI> that
is, the middle-time between mid-day
and Sun-set, call to prayers, they
de&s;ired a Carpet might be &s;pread in
the Court-yard upon the ground,
where they went very devoutly to
their prayers, and left us to wonder
at their &s;tupid and irreligious hypo|cri&s;ie.
This is no very rare or un|u&s;ual
thing among them, it being
what I have &s;een al&s;o practi&s;ed be|fore
a great number of <HI>Christians</HI>
in other places.</P>
<P>The Fa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fa&s;t of <HI>Rama|zan.</HI></NOTE> which every year is ob|&s;erved
in the month of <HI>Ramazan,</HI> is
another great fundamental of the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion. Which though
it be fix'd as to the month, yet be|cau&s;e
the years they make u&s;e of in
their Religious and Civil accompts
are Lunary, without any intercala|tion
to adju&s;t the different periods of
<PB N="62" REF="39">
the motions of the Sun and Moon,
there is an anticipation made every
year of eleven days, and by con&s;e|quent
it does not return to the &s;ame
beginning, till after a Circle of thir|ty
three years has expired. In de|termining
the beginnings of months,
not troubling them&s;elves with the
nice calculations of <HI>Astronomy,</HI> they
only re&s;pect the Pha&s;is of the Moon,
not in the lea&s;t its Conjunction;
and accordingly, as it mu&s;t needs
often happen, they begin the month
one day &s;ooner or later, as the Moon
appears. Sometimes they have cau|&s;ed
their Lamps at their <HI>Mo&s;chs</HI> in
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> which is the u&s;ual
&s;ignal in this month, to be lighted
at midnight, as &s;oon as it has been
atte&s;ted by credible Witne&s;&s;es, who
either have had better eyes or a
clearer Horizon, that they have &s;een
the Moon that night. But however
to prevent confu&s;ion, in rainy and
cloudy weather, after a days ex|pectation
and forbearance, they be|gin
it the next, when the thickne&s;s
and hazine&s;s of the Sky hinder it
<PB N="63" REF="39">
from appearing. Generally upon
the &s;ight of the New-Moon they
bow their bodies, gently &s;troking
their faces and beards, and put up
prayers to <HI>God.</HI> During this month,
as long as the Sun continues above
the Horizon, a total ab&s;tinence from
all manner of &s;u&s;tenance is injoined;
in the very heat of Summer, when
the length of the days adds to the
trouble and irk&s;omene&s;s of it, they
dare not &s;o much as put one drop
of water into their mouths; and
indeed herein their &s;trength and
their patience are both equally to
be admired; &s;uch re&s;traints a fear
of violating this &s;evere Law of their
<HI>Prophet</HI> lays upon their very natures,
that a natural <HI>Turk,</HI> though at other
times bruti&s;h enough, and apt to
indulge his appetite, will choo&s;e ra|ther
to peri&s;h with thir&s;t, and faint
away by rea&s;on of an empty &s;to|mach,
than commit &s;uch a great
&s;in, though in private and out of
the &s;ight of the world. Their con|&s;tancy
or rather ob&s;tinacy have been
&s;o great, that their Hi&s;tories relate,
<PB N="64" REF="40">
that the <HI>Janizaries</HI> them&s;elves, who
in &s;everal other matters do not u&s;e
to be over &s;crupulous, when they
have been in the Field and prepa|ring
to engage their enemies, have
abhorred the very thought of eat|ing
and drinking in <HI>Ramazan</HI> time,
till they have been di&s;pensed with by
the <HI>Mufti,</HI> a&s;&s;uring them by his in|fallible
authority, that it is more ac|ceptable
to <HI>God,</HI> to defend his Re|ligion
again&s;t the enemies of it,
than to ob&s;erve its precepts to the
prejudice of it, in weakning them|&s;elves
by &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive and immo|derate
fa&s;ting; and the Emperors
own example has prevailed with
them above the nece&s;&s;ities of na|ture.
The <HI>Renegadoes</HI> perchance,
who have embraced <HI>Mahometi&s;m,</HI>
that they may wallow the more &s;e|curely
in all manner of &s;en&s;uality
and lu&s;t (for no one can be &s;uppo|&s;ed
&s;o &s;otti&s;h, or void of rea&s;on and
common &s;ence, as to embrace it up|on
conviction, as if he had found by
&s;trength of argument, that it was
true, and upon that account ought
<PB N="65" REF="40">
to be embraced) do not u&s;e this &s;e|verity
upon them&s;elves; but then
their great care is, that they be not
di&s;covered. For though it be not a
capital crime, yet the irreligious cri|minal,
if convicted before the <HI>Cady,</HI>
is oftentimes drub'd, and by way
of expiation and penance, is to fa&s;t
a con&s;iderable number of days. To
prevent the &s;candal and the puni&s;h|ment
of it, they dur&s;t not &s;o much
as enter into a <HI>Cabaret</HI> (when the
<HI>Greeks</HI> were allowed to &s;ell Wine)
which would have been a double
crime, remembring the &s;ad fate of
him, who being got drunk in the
<HI>Ramazan</HI> time, had hot melted
Lead poured down his Throat and
into his Ears by <HI>Na&s;&s;uf,</HI> who was
chief <HI>Vizir</HI> under <HI>Achmet,</HI> who
judged his bad example merited
this &s;everity: though &s;ome, out of
their exce&s;&s;ive love to it, will ven|ture
to drink in <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> Hou&s;es,
where they may be free and can
have it. Their luxury, in&s;tead of
being repre&s;&s;ed by this total ab&s;ti|nence,
is the rather heightned and
<PB N="66" REF="41">
inflamed; for as &s;oon as the Sun is
&s;et, and their Lamps flame round
about the Towers of their <HI>Mo&s;chs,</HI>
which they place in &s;everal figures,
as of a Gally, and the like, which
make a very diverting &s;hew; and
that prayers are ended, from which
none who are well are to be ab&s;ent,
who have any care of their reputa|tion,
they play the gluttons more
&s;olemnly, and &s;pend the whole night
in entertainments and revellings.
They pa&s;s over the day with a great
deal of wearine&s;s and drow&s;ine&s;s,
wi&s;hing and yawning till the Even|ing-Star
appears; but in the night
they enjoy them&s;elves doubly for
their forced ab&s;tinence and for|bearance;
which is therefore the
more &s;hameful and ridiculous, be|cau&s;e
it is but an introduction to
riot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ca&s;e of &s;ick per|&s;ons, Tra|vellers, and Children.</NOTE> Sick per&s;ons and Travellers are

have filled up the number. Some

con&s;ecrated by <HI>Mahomet</HI> to this &s;o|lemnity,
becau&s;e in it he pretended
to receive the <HI>Alcoran</HI> from Heaven.
In this they all pretend to a greater
devotion than ordinary; and he
who at other times &s;carce cared to
go to Church, thinks now to redeem
his former neglects by his greater
diligence and frequency. The la&s;t
day of it is devoted to the memory
of their dead Friends and Relations,
who&s;e Graves marked with red Oker
they u&s;ually vi&s;it, and put up their
prayers and &s;uffrages for their Souls,
that it may be well with them;
with which ceremony they end the
<PB N="68" REF="42">
day and the Fa&s;t together.</P>
<P>The following Moon begins the
Fea&s;t of the great <HI>Bairam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fea&s;t of great <HI>Bairam.</HI></NOTE> which
is a time of great mirth and joy,

the fir&s;t day of this Fe&s;tival;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacrifice Sheep.</NOTE>
which they call <HI>Kurban,</HI> or <HI>the Of|fering,</HI>

(<HI>Mahomet</HI> borrowing &s;omething out
of the Religions then mo&s;t in vogue,
when he fir&s;t &s;tarted up a <HI>Prophet</HI>)
and is que&s;tionle&s;s looked upon by
them in the nature of an expiatory
<PB N="69" REF="42">
Sacrifice, which they u&s;e at other
times upon &s;olemn occa&s;ions. As
<HI>Solyman,</HI> when he enter'd <HI>Buda</HI>
1541, &s;acrificed in the great Church
dedicated to the <HI>V. Mary,</HI> turned
into a <HI>Mo&s;ch;</HI> and &s;o at <HI>Strigoni|um</HI>
two years after, in 1543; As
<HI>Selim</HI> his Father did at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI>
for good &s;ucce&s;s in his expe|dition
into <HI>Egypt.</HI> Every man is
his own Prie&s;t, and may &s;lay his
Sheep at his own Hou&s;e. They
di&s;tribute the &s;everal parts of it a|mong
the poor, re&s;erving nothing
in the lea&s;t to their own u&s;es, which
will take off from the merit of the
Sacrifice; which al&s;o cea&s;es and is
rendred ineffectual, if the&s;e Victims
be purcha&s;ed with money, got dis|hone&s;tly
either by fraud or violence.
I have been a&s;&s;ured of a <HI>Turk,</HI> who
was &s;o &s;crupulous this way, that in|&s;tead
of &s;ati&s;fying for the inju&s;tice
he had been guilty of, and re&s;toring
what he was wrongfully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of, only de&s;ired an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant

him than tho&s;e he parted with, as if
the money only were in fault, and
drew a cur&s;e after it, which he fan|cied
thus ea&s;ily avoided by an ex|change.
The Sheep thus &s;acrificed,
they fancy enter into Paradi&s;e,
and there graze all along the
flow'ry Meadows upon the Banks of
Rivers flowing with Milk and Ho|ney.</P>
<P>Seventy days after is the Fea&s;t

pomp and &s;hew, and for better &s;e|curity

there are places a&s;&s;igned confining

<P>The <HI>Haggiler</HI> or Pilgrims put on

is often too con&s;ulted in Civil affairs

upon Religion; and &s;o may
be lookt upon under the notion of
a &s;upreme Judge under the Empe|ror,
as well as of a Chief Prie&s;t. He
is the great Doctor and Oracle of
their Law, and Heir (as they &s;peak)
of the Doctrine of the Prophets and
Apo&s;tles, the Fountain of vertue and
knowledge, one who can re&s;olve all
the difficulties of Religion, and who
has a Key to open all the trea&s;ures
of truth; for by the&s;e and &s;uch like
fooli&s;h characters do they repre&s;ent
him. Let him be never &s;o dull and
&s;tupid otherwi&s;e, either through a
natural incapacity, or age, or any
other defect, if he be preferred to
the <HI>Mufti&s;hip,</HI> as &s;ome have been
out of a capriccio by &s;ome Empe|rors,
pre&s;ently he becomes infalli|ble;
his deci&s;ions are &s;acred and
authentick, and his authority is un|que&s;tionable
and received without
any di&s;pute or debate, and his dreams
are lookt upon as in&s;piration, as
<PB N="81" REF="48">
being <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s repre&s;entative.
Though he poor man, con&s;cious to
him&s;elf of the Cheat, u&s;es to be
over-mode&s;t, and is a&s;hamed to
a&s;&s;ume this inerrable power, and
&s;ub&s;cribes his Sentence with this
u&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>God knows better;</HI>
which is yet no bar to the Peoples
opinion and e&s;teem of him; and no
one under the Emperour dares pa&s;s
judgment contrary to his determina|tion.
To keep up this veneration of
the <HI>Mu&s;ti</HI> in the People, the Empe|rour
de&s;cends from his State, and as
&s;oon as he appears before him, ri&s;es
up and advances lei&s;urely &s;ix or
&s;even &s;teps towards him, and per|mits
him to ki&s;s his left Shoulder;
whereas the chief <HI>Vizir</HI> is only per|mitted
to ki&s;s and &s;alute the hem of
his Ve&s;t, though to do &s;ome little
honour to his fir&s;t Mini&s;ter he makes
a &s;tep or two forward to meet him.
The Emperour makes great u&s;e of
him in his private Councils, and
&s;carce &s;its upon a great de&s;ign with|out
his advice, to make it take the
more among the Souldiers and Peo|ple,
<PB N="82" REF="49">
who a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves both
of the lawfulne&s;s, and convenience,
and nece&s;&s;ity of an Expedition, and
flatter them&s;elves too with the good
&s;ucce&s;s of it, if it be ratifyed by his
con&s;ent, and ble&s;t by his Prayers
and encouragement. If rea&s;on of
State judg it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trangle or
take off the head of a <HI>Vizir,</HI> any
other <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> or General of the <HI>Jani|zaries;</HI>
the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s con&s;ent will vin|dicate
the execution, and &s;top the
clamours and di&s;contents of the
Soldiers and People: who by this
are made to believe, that the per&s;on
cut off de&s;erved to die according to
the Law; and that it is a piece of Reli|gion
to &s;ubmit to the Emperours
Plea&s;ure, and the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s determi|nation
nole&s;s than to the Will of <HI>God.</HI>
The Authority of the <HI>Mufti</HI> being
&s;o great, the Emperour will not tru&s;t
a matter of that con&s;equence to an
election, knowing that the keeping up
his Prerogative in the di&s;posal of &s;uch
an office to a fit per&s;on, who &s;hall
comply with his humour and the
nece&s;&s;ity of State, is a ju&s;t piece of
<PB N="83" REF="49">
Policy, on which may oftentimes
depend the &s;afety and &s;ecurity of his
Per&s;on and Government. Although
u&s;ually he prefers one of the <HI>Cadile|&s;kires</HI>
into the place of the depo&s;ed
or dead <HI>Mufti,</HI> if he be for his turn;
But in ca&s;e the <HI>Mufti</HI> &s;hould prove
re&s;ractory and di&s;turb his Councels
by throwing in &s;cruples of Con|&s;cience,
and refu&s;e to obey and con|firm
his Orders, though they be
never &s;o unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable,
they are not long to &s;eek for a reme|dy;
and as if the &s;pirit of infallibi|lity,
wherewith he was before in|ve&s;ted,
immediately upon this fooli&s;h
act of di&s;obedience, left him to his
pure natural condition; then he is
&s;aid to dote, and to be infatuated,
and to forfeit his di&s;cretion and un|der&s;tanding,
and is hereby rendred
unworthy of &s;o holy and &s;uper|eminent
a dignity; and one pre&s;ently
is &s;ub&s;tituted into his place, who
under&s;tands better the Arts of com|pliance
and Court&s;hip, and will re|ceive
as an Oracle whatever comes
propo&s;ed to him out of the <HI>Sera|glio.</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="50">
The <HI>Mufti</HI> by his place always
moves with the Emperour; none of
his Retinue more con&s;tantly attends
him, that he may be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t
with his Councel at all times in ca&s;e
of doubt or difficulty. This high
place lies in common to any one,
whom the Emperour &s;hall think fit
to dignifie and honour with it, and
is not confined to the Kindred and
Po&s;terity of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as &s;ome
through a mi&s;take have affirmed.</P>
<P>I am fully a&s;&s;ured the <HI>Mufti</HI> &s;ome|times
acts as a meer Politician and
Coun&s;ellor of State, though the
advancement of Religion is always
the pretence, as it happened upon a
debate before the Emperour much
about the year 1669. when there
were di&s;patched two Gentlemen out
of <HI>Croatia</HI> with full Commi&s;&s;ion to
treat about their becoming tributa|ry
to the <HI>Grand Signor,</HI> from &s;eve|ral
of the Nobles of the <HI>Roman</HI>
communion, who afterwards had
their heads &s;truck off at <HI>New&s;tadt,</HI>

of <HI>Germany,</HI> who&s;e Govern|ment

thought to ju&s;tifie and &s;ecure their

of <HI>Adrianople</HI> was again&s;t
their being received, as being again&s;t
the Peace made &s;o &s;olemnly after the

with the <HI>Venetians</HI> in <HI>Candia,</HI> to
bring the <HI>Germans</HI> upon their backs,
which would inevitably follow; but
the <HI>Mufti</HI> was as zealous and fierce
for their being taken into protection,
alledging that the <HI>Port</HI> was the
refuge of the world, and that the
Intere&s;t of Religion as well as of
State would be advanced by &s;uch an
acqui&s;t, which the Chri&s;tians them|&s;elves
would maintain and make
good to them, and that this was of
greater obligation, than the &s;trict
ob&s;erving of a Treaty, that the mis|fortunes
of the la&s;t <HI>Hungarian</HI> War
forced them to &s;ubmit to. The Em|perour
di&s;tracted with &s;uch different
<PB N="86" REF="51">
Coun&s;els, would re&s;olve nothing till
he had received the opinion of the <HI>Vi|zir</HI>
then before <HI>Candia;</HI> but before
that could be brought back, they
had certain intelligence, that <HI>Croatia</HI>
was over run with an Army of Thir|ty
thou&s;and, and the whole force of
the di&s;contented and rebellious No|bility
defeated, and not an Acre of
Land left to plant a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gar|ri&s;on
in.</P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Mufti</HI> are the two
<HI>Cadileskires,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cadiles|kires.</NOTE> the one of <HI>Anatolia,</HI>
who has the precedence, and the
other of <HI>Rumuli</HI> or <HI>Thrace;</HI> the
authority of which latter, notwith|&s;tanding,
the &s;eeming re&s;traint of
the name, is extended as far as the
<HI>Turk</HI> has any Dominions in <HI>Europe.</HI>
The&s;e formerly were, as their titles
literally &s;ignify, <HI>Judges of the Army;</HI>
and perpetually attended the Camp
to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice among the
Souldiers, that &s;o the Di&s;cipline of
War might receive &s;upport, and be
maintained, and kept up better by
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Law; and little
quarrels that might ari&s;e among
<PB N="87" REF="51">
them, might be the more fairly de|termined,
and capital puni&s;hments
inflicted according to the demerit
of the Criminals. This was the
de&s;ign of their Original In&s;titution;
but at pre&s;ent they only a&s;&s;i&s;t the
<HI>Vizir</HI> or his Deputy, in deciding
civil Cau&s;es, and exerci&s;e no autho|rity

who have long &s;ince extorted this
Priviledge from the <HI>Grand Signor,</HI>
to be tryed only by their re&s;pective
Commanders and Officers, They
have carried before them a Pole or
Spear, on the top of which hangs
hor&s;e-hair, as an En&s;ign of Honour;
to &s;upport which, be&s;ides what they
get by bribes and fees from the
parties contending, which are greater
or le&s;&s;er proportionally to the quan|tity
of the Sum, about which the
Suit is commenced, They have a
daily allowance of Five hundred
A&s;pers out of the Exchequer, accor|ding
to the Canon e&s;tablished by the
Emperour <HI>Suleiman.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mollas</HI> challenge the third
place: who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mollas.</NOTE> under the <HI>Ba&s;&s;as,</HI> are
<PB N="88" REF="52">
Judges and Pre&s;idents of Provinces:
in the chief Cities of which they
re&s;ide, and to whom the <HI>Cadies</HI> or
inferiour Judges are obliged to give
an accompt of their Judicature.
Their pay is out of the Publick
Trea&s;ure, which is never le&s;s than
Three hundred Aspers a day, but
always under the allowance of the
<HI>Cadileskires.</HI> The fir&s;t de&s;ign and
intent of the allowance was agreea|ble
to Equity and Ju&s;tice, that they
might live hand&s;omly and well, and
never be forced to de&s;cend to ba&s;e
Arts and ways of gain, unworthy
their places, or be under the temp|tation
of perverting the Law for
reward and gain. But this does not
&s;ati&s;fie and content their avarice,
who are not a&s;hamed to extort Mo|ney
and Pre&s;ents from the &s;everal
Parties, who mu&s;t this way defend
their Cau&s;e, if they would not have
it mi&s;carry, be it never &s;o ju&s;t and
equitable in it &s;elf. This is the be&s;t
and mo&s;t effectual Plea they can
po&s;&s;ibly make: for certainly if Ju|&s;tice
be to be &s;old in any part of the
<PB N="89" REF="52">
world, it is in <HI>Turkey.</HI> For though
they may pretend Religion and Con|&s;cience,
and may &s;eem nice in deter|mining
&s;ome Suits; yet it is both
known and &s;adly experienced, by
poor Chri&s;tians e&s;pecially, if they
implead any <HI>Turk,</HI> that they are
horribly corrupt, and men of no
faith or hone&s;ty, and judg the cau&s;e
on his &s;ide, who has given the

from the infamy and guilt of
inju&s;tice, they alledge &s;everal tricki&s;h
&s;ubtilties out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and
from Tradition, and to &s;tave off the
injured per&s;on from pur&s;uing his
right, and pro&s;ecuting his complaint.
The&s;e are reckoned among the num|ber
of Church-men, the Law by
which they judge and determine
Ca&s;es, being as much a part of their
Religion, and founded in their <HI>Al|coran</HI>
and <HI>Sunna</HI> or Tradition, as
the Rites of their Wor&s;hip: and al|though
they have nothing to do in
the <HI>Mo&s;chs,</HI> and &s;u&s;tain only the
office of Civil Judges; they are
accordingly advanced to the highe&s;t
<PB N="90" REF="53">
dignity a Church-man is capa|ble
of.</P>

maintained, who take turns in cele|brating
their office, or el&s;e for grea|ter

A &s;mall proportion and
mea&s;ure of Learning is a &s;ufficient
qualification of a <HI>Turki&s;h Prie&s;t;</HI>
there is no great need of any praevious
&s;tudy, or a peculiar education and
de&s;ignment to make any candidate
fit to take the care and Government
of a <HI>Mo&s;ch</HI> upon him. For the mo&s;t
part if he can but read the Prayers,
and write and recite a few Ver&s;icles
out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and be no way
&s;candalous in his life, though he has
been at a Trade all his life long, he
is very capable, if he can get to be
nominated to fill up any vacancy;
and in ca&s;e of any mi&s;carriage or
unfitne&s;s degraded as it were from
his function, and he contentedly
returns to his Trade again, and one

three Suns to &s;earch them, if they
have no Contraband Goods or

from their Patrons; we went
a&s;hore, and had &s;carce pa&s;t through
a Street or two in <HI>Se&s;tos,</HI> but we
were overtaken by an Officer &s;ent
from the Governour to bring us be|fore
him: we under&s;tood the mean|ing

to the Ca&s;tle bought &s;ome Coffee

prevented the demands of the &s;eve|ral
<HI>Cadyes,</HI> out of which number I

He hearing that there were &s;everal

<PB N="98" REF="57">
we replied, that we had the

all injury and exaction, and to tra|vel
unmole&s;ted; for &s;uch a one two

the truth is, we did not rely &s;o much

the weakne&s;s of the Village: For
this once glorious City the Metro|polis

become a very pitiful and de&s;pica|ble

with the &s;ight of our Pa&s;s|port,
he counterfeits re&s;pect and

and therefore &s;everely forbids
a poor Chri&s;tian, that we employed

when we were at lei&s;ure to reflect

<HI>Janizaries</HI> go to a Ba|kers

of bread to be&s;tow by way of cha|rity

ready to peri&s;h for want of a little
relief, the &s;ight of &s;uch a mi&s;erable
object would have no way moved
them to pity: and though they are
&s;o trouble&s;om, in the night e&s;peci|ally,
no one dares either &s;tab them
or poy&s;on them without danger of
being &s;tabb'd him&s;elf if the fact
were di&s;covered. How idly and
fondly &s;uper&s;titious they are here|in,
will appear by the en&s;uing re|lation,
which though it hapned in
the time of <HI>Achmet,</HI> yet &s;till holds
true, and repre&s;ents their pre&s;ent
temper. The Plague raging very
hot, the Emperour and the Ba&s;&s;as
at la&s;t &s;eemed to make a mighty
di&s;covery, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="106" REF="61">
de&s;troy the Dogs in and about <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI>
to prevent the further
&s;preading of the Infection: but the
<HI>Mufti,</HI> who was con&s;ulted in this
weighty Affair, would by no means
give way to &s;o bloody and cruel a
&s;entence, maintaining it was alto|gether
unlawful; and that he might
not &s;eem to be peremptory without
cau&s;e, he added this momentous
rea&s;on, that <HI>Dogs had &s;ouls,</HI> and
therefore were to be exempt from
this univer&s;al and horrid carnage.
But it was a plain ca&s;e, &s;o great a
number of Dogs was a real mi&s;chief:
what therefore was to be done in
this great &s;trait and perplexity of
mind? Upon the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s &s;entence
they recalled the former order a|bout
their &s;laughter, and re&s;olved to
tran&s;port them over the Water to
<HI>Asia</HI>-&s;ide; above fifty thou&s;and were
found upon the Mu&s;ter, and carried
over to <HI>Scutary</HI> and the Neigh|bouring
places: but though they
were out of &s;ight, yet they were
not out of mind; and their care of
them &s;eemed to be doubled, and
<PB N="107" REF="61">
Provi&s;ions were &s;ent daily over to
keep life and &s;oul together, in com|pliance
with the <HI>Mufti</HI>'s learned and
philo&s;ophical determination; till at
la&s;t growing weary of the expence
and trouble, and fearing they might
infect the places where they were,
with great trouble and reluctancy
of mind they conveyed them to &s;ome
of the uninhabited I&s;lands that lie
in the <HI>Propontis</HI> toward the Bay of
<HI>Nicomedia,</HI> where they were fami&s;h|ed.
But the City &s;ince is &s;o pe&s;ter'd
with them, that I believe if a new
Mu&s;ter were now made, the number
would be found to be greater. No
one mu&s;t offer to kick or touch any
of them; if a Chri&s;tian does this
by chance, they impute it to his
hatred and ill will, and will be &s;ure
to chide, if not beat him for it: as
one in a great fury askt a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI>
who through great ha&s;te and care|le&s;ne&s;s
trod upon a Mangey Curr,
that lay in the way, <HI>Thou Infidel,
how do&s;t thou know, but that thy
fathers &s;oul is in that poor dog?</HI>
&s;hewing by this his love to the
<PB N="108" REF="62">

for he was one of tho&s;e who main|tained
the idle Pythagorean dream
of a <GAP DESC="foreign"> or tran&s;migration of

<P>They &s;till retain the ab&s;urd prin|ciple
of fate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The opini|on of Fate.</NOTE> which is the genuine
i&s;&s;ue of their gro&s;s ignorance and

encounter the greate&s;t dangers of
Death with &s;uch de&s;perate boldne&s;s;
fearle&s;s and &s;ecure, as to their
thoughts, in the time of a raging
Plague. The contagion does not
hinder them from vi&s;iting per&s;ons
infected, with the &s;ame freedom, as
if they were only &s;ick of an ordi|nary
Fever; they wipe their faces
with the Handkerchiefs of their
dead Friends, and put on the very
cloaths they but lately died in:
their confidence being grounded
upon this fooli&s;h belief, that every
man's de&s;tiny is written in his fore|head,
and not to be prevented or
kept off by care or Medicine, that
the term of life is fatal and perem|ptory,
and that it is in vain to go
<PB N="109" REF="62">
about to extend it beyond the &s;et
Period; and that Phy&s;ick is to be
taken not to prolong life, but to
take off from the angui&s;h and bit|terne&s;s
of death, and to make the
pangs of it the more tolerable and
ea&s;ie: and that it is a piece of folly
to think to e&s;cape. This error de|&s;troys
thou&s;ands of them yearly,
who ha&s;ten their own death by their
conceitedne&s;s and folly: which is
true of the common people e&s;pe|cially,
in who&s;e minds this fancy
is &s;o rooted, that they think it a
kind of Sin as well as weakne&s;s to re|linqui&s;h
their hou&s;es, and retire to
more whol&s;om air; what, &s;ay they,
is not the Plague the dart of the
<HI>Almighty God?</HI> and can we e&s;cape
the blow that he levels at us? is not
his hand &s;teady to hit the per&s;ons
he aims at? can we run out of his
&s;ight, and beyond his power? thus
calling in the belief of &s;ome of the

and when the Plague grows
hot and violent, provide for the
&s;afety of their Families by a timely
flight into the neighbouring Villa|ges,
where they keep them till the
fury of it is &s;pent; while entire
Families (and one I heard of in
our time in <HI>Galata</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix

much to it; which the
wi&s;er &s;ort cannot but acknowledg;
but they are &s;o u&s;ed to the Plague,
that they are not much &s;olicitous

any publick Prayers and In|terce&s;&s;ions,

are carried daily out at <HI>Adrianople</HI>
Gate to the publick places of Burial,
which lye in the plain without the
City, and are extended from the
<HI>Propontis</HI> to the Haven. For though
it be an arrow that cannot be put by,
yet they acknowledg it is in the
hand of God, and that he can &s;top
it if he plea&s;es; and &s;o are forced
at la&s;t to acknowledg the weakne&s;s
and fal&s;ity of their own Principle.
At &s;uch times, as al&s;o when the

<HI>Mufti</HI> makes his prayers: after
which Ceremony is over, they think
they have done all they can do, and
leave off all further care. This is
their great argument of comfort up|on
the death of their friends, that
it is the decree and plea&s;ure of <HI>God,</HI>
which they are to &s;ubmit to, and
that all humane coun&s;els and reme|dies
are ineffectual again&s;t his will,
(which is a great truth in it &s;elf, but
very much mi&s;applied by them)

made capital; or el&s;e of di&s;&s;olute
lives, and wallowing in brutality,
that they may enjoy their lu&s;ts more
freely, and without check and re|mor&s;e
of con&s;cience, embrace the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, look upon it
<PB N="115" REF="65">
and all other Religions as a meer
cheat, and by their lives &s;hew the
di&s;e&s;teem of them. The other be|ing
men who&s;e under&s;tandings are
&s;omewhat refined by their educa|tion
from the &s;tupidity and dulne&s;s
of the ordinary <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of
the idle fopperies of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI>
and of the impo&s;ture of <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
and of the ab&s;urdities of his Do|ctrine,
and the incon&s;i&s;tency of it
with the principles of right Rea|&s;on,
ra&s;hly conclude of Religion in
general, that it is a trick of State,
and an invention of Policy; and that
the belief of a <HI>God</HI> and of Provi|dence
is wholly owing to the cre|dulity
and &s;uper&s;tition and unju&s;t
fears of mankind. Only they are
&s;o wi&s;e and cunning to conceal
their Athei&s;m, which they are &s;o
ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected to be guilty of, for
fear of the great danger an open
profe&s;&s;ion of it would involve them
in. For the <HI>Turks</HI> are mighty zea|lous
for the exi&s;tence of a Deity
again&s;t the Athei&s;t, and think &s;uch
a per&s;on not worthy to breath in
<PB N="116" REF="66">
the air, who dares deny this fun|damental
principle of nature. And
the example of &s;uch a ju&s;t &s;everity
is very fre&s;h in their memories,
as hapning in the year of Chri&s;t
M.DC.LXI, upon a certain <HI>Maho|metan,</HI>
which I &s;hall here put down
from the mouths of credible per|&s;ons,
who knew the man very fa|miliarly.
This <HI>Mahomet Ephendi</HI>
(which is a title of re&s;pect they
u&s;ually be&s;tow upon men of learn|ing
and authority) was born
in <HI>Larr</HI> in <HI>Armeuia major,</HI> a man
of great e&s;teem in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>
among all who knew him, for his
skill in the Law, and in the <HI>Ara|bick</HI>
and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> languages, of a
temper mild and &s;ociable, which
made him covet the acquaintance
and friend&s;hip of &s;everal <HI>We&s;tern
Chri&s;tians,</HI> from whom he could
learn &s;omewhat, and whom he ac|knowledged
to under&s;tand the laws
of di&s;course, and to rea&s;on much
better than his Brother <HI>Turks,</HI> whom
he lookt upon as very dull and hea|vy
fellows. His inqui&s;itive genius
<PB N="117" REF="66">
put him upon the &s;earch of &s;everal
things, and his pride and conceit|edne&s;s
were &s;o great, that he thought
he had found the &s;ecret indeed,
which all the Athei&s;ts have been
&s;eeking after to quiet and bani&s;h
tho&s;e fears which perpetually haunt
their guilty minds. Ambitious of
fame and applau&s;e, he &s;ets up for a
profe&s;t Athei&s;t, being &s;o far from
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e extravagant fancies,
the effect of the greate&s;t madne&s;s
whatever, that he takes care to divulge
them in all companies where he
thought to meet with oppo&s;ition,
and di&s;putes fiercely again&s;t the be|ing
of a <HI>God.</HI> Whenever he went
to vi&s;it <HI>Signor Warner,</HI> who&s;e ex|traordinary
learning and worth de|rived
a great lu&s;tre upon his pub|lick
character, the fir&s;t &s;alute upon
the very &s;ight of him was, <HI>there is
not,</HI> meaning a <HI>God;</HI> to which the
<HI>Re&s;ident</HI> would immediately reply,
<HI>there is;</HI> after which they would
often de&s;cend to a clo&s;e di&s;pute
about that dictate of univer&s;al na|ture,
and right rea&s;on; but he had
<PB N="118" REF="67">
&s;o hardned his heart again&s;t all
conviction, and blinded his mind
and under&s;tanding with ab&s;urd and
irrational prejudices, and fooli&s;h and
vain imaginations, that though he
could not well &s;u&s;tain the mighty
&s;hock of arguments which the learn|ed
<HI>Re&s;ident</HI> level'd at him, yet he
flatter'd him&s;elf he could fully &s;a|tisfie
them all, and that he had the
better of him. But in the mi&s;erable
end of this wretch the Divine ju&s;tice
was as much &s;een as if he had been
con&s;um'd by Lightning from Hea|ven.
There hapning in the publick
<HI>Caravan&s;erai,</HI> where he lodged, a
quarrel between him and &s;ome <HI>Ar|menian
Chri&s;tian</HI> Merchants, they
carried him before the <HI>Caimacam,</HI>
who is the Governour of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI>
who had for his A&s;&s;i&s;tant
the chief Ju&s;tice of the City, whom
they call <HI>Stambol Ephendi.</HI> The in|jury
he had done the <HI>Armenians</HI>
was proved by &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es;
and in the clo&s;e the <HI>Turks,</HI> who
were pre&s;ent, acquainted the Judges
of the temper of the man, and accu&s;ed
<PB N="119" REF="67">
him of &s;everal impieties he was
guilty of, as that he never came to
the prayers of the <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI> neglected
the other rites in&s;tituted by their
<HI>Prophet,</HI> drank Wine freely, and
that in the time of <HI>Ramazan;</HI> and
be&s;ides, that he openly maintained
that there was no <HI>God.</HI> The con|te&s;tation
through the zeal of the
<HI>Turks</HI> grew very hot, and matter
of fact &s;eemed to be fully made
out by ju&s;t proof. Whereupon the
Governour demanded of him, what
he could &s;ay for him&s;elf? whether
the evidence again&s;t him were true
or no? here &s;everal unanimou&s;ly
agree, that you deny the being of
a <HI>God.</HI> He replied without any de|mur
or feat, you would be of the
&s;ame mind if you knew as much as
I know. They advi&s;e him, if he
valued his life, to retract his fooli&s;h
and impious opinion, otherwi&s;e they
would pa&s;s the &s;entence of death
upon him. They give him time to
con&s;ider of it, and expect that what|ever
his private &s;entiments were, fear
of death would make him confe&s;s
<PB N="120" REF="68">
his belief of a Deity. But it &s;eems
he would be a Martyr for his A|thei&s;m,
and cho&s;e rather to dye than
confe&s;s he was in an error, and di&s;|&s;emble
his inward thoughts; where|upon
he is &s;entenced to dye; he con|tinues
as perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate as
ever, even in the la&s;t moments of
his life. For being &s;et upon a Mule
with his face toward the tail, and
carried to the place of puni&s;hment,
and admoni&s;ht by the <HI>Suba&s;hi</HI> or
Officer, who attended upon the ex|ecution,
to recant his error; his
only an&s;wer was, that the filth (for
&s;o I chu&s;e mode&s;tly to expre&s;s it) he
was to eat he would eat pre&s;ently;
meaning by the rude Proverb, that
he was willing to dye as &s;oon as
might be. Thus he peri&s;ht in his
folly, being between fifty and &s;ix|ty
years of age, and leaving a con|&s;iderable
&s;um of money behind him,
infatuated by the ju&s;t judgment of
<HI>God,</HI> which became mo&s;t vi&s;ible in
his de&s;erved ruine.</P>

But there di&s;cipline of late years
has not been kept up to this great
height of &s;everity, but is very much
relaxed and corrupted. And be|cau&s;e
that according to the u&s;ual
maxime of policy, which experience
hath &s;o often confirmed and rendred
<PB N="124" REF="70">
little le&s;s than infallible, Empires are
kept and pre&s;erved by the &s;ame arts
wherewith they were fir&s;t e&s;tablisht,
which cea&s;ing, they begin to moulder
into pieces: We may look upon this
decay of di&s;cipline as a good omen,
that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, which has
been rais'd to that great pitch and
degree of glory, upon the ruin of
&s;o many Kingdoms and Govern|ments,
grows towards an end; the
&s;ame fate u&s;ually attending Govern|ments,
as &s;ingle per&s;ons, that after
a &s;et period of years, broken with
inte&s;tine factions and divi&s;ions, or
weakned with idlene&s;s and the
charmes and delights of a long and
uninterrupted peace they peri&s;h and
decay. They are not now &s;o &s;olicitous
to fill up tho&s;e &s;eminaries with
<HI>Agiamoglans,</HI> which anciently were
accounted the hope and growing
&s;trength of the Empire; and in|deed
of late years they have &s;pent
&s;uch a va&s;t number of Soldiers in the
Wars, that they cannot get &s;upplies
hence fa&s;t enough to &s;erve the ne|ce&s;&s;ities
of War. A very con&s;idera|ble
<PB N="125" REF="70">
part of the veterance Soldiers
was lo&s;t in <HI>Candia,</HI> which they them|&s;elves
have called the burying place
of <HI>Mu&s;ulmans.</HI> For by a very ju&s;t
calculation from their fir&s;t landing in
the Island, and &s;itting down before <HI>Ca|nea</HI>
to the &s;urrender of the chief City,
what by Plague and what by Sword
and Mine above four hundred thou|&s;and
peri&s;ht there; the tediou&s;ne&s;s
and di&s;advantages of the War were
&s;o grievous and irk&s;ome to them, that
the <HI>Janizaries</HI> went thither very un|willingly
and without any heart to
fight, who dread all expeditions by
Sea, upbraiding the Emperor with the
mi&s;fortunes and ill &s;ucce&s;s of the de|&s;ign,
while their Country was impove|ri&s;h't
by the <HI>Temins,</HI> a fal&s;e Coin of
mixt and ba&s;e mettal, (which were
imported in va&s;t quantities by the
<HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants) &amp; that
the Soldiers were thrown away in
<HI>Crete,</HI> &amp; yet for all this, that he went
a hunting. To &s;upply the Siege, which
made &s;uch continual wa&s;tes of them,
I have known &s;everal country fellows
taken from the plough, and enrolled
<HI>Janizaries</HI> without any previous ex|erci&s;es
<PB N="126" REF="71">
of arms. Formerly all the
<HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan Janizaries</HI> were
quartered in two &s;pacious hou|&s;es
under the banners of their re|&s;pective
officers, and kept guard
and watch; but now for a little pre|&s;ent
they are di&s;pen&s;t from this at|tendance,
and are permitted to marry,
and accordingly &s;everal make u&s;e of
the indulgence; the cares of the
world put them upon arts of gain to
maintain them&s;elves and their fami|lies;
and natural affection takes off
their minds from the pur&s;uit and
love of armes, and makes them chu&s;e
rather to lye at home in their hou&s;es
than go into the field. They are
bu&s;ied in the management of trade,
and turn &s;hop-keepers, and by an idle
and &s;edentary kind of life remit much
of their warlike ambition and fierce|ne&s;s,
and are become &s;oft and effemi|nate;
all their thoughts and wi&s;hes
being for peace and quiet. But how|ever,
the privileges of the <HI>Janiza|ries</HI>
being &s;o great and the name
honourable, they get their children
admitted into the &s;ame order; of
<PB N="127" REF="71">
which they are very tender and &s;oli|citous;
and le&s;t they &s;hould any
way be dimini&s;h't by any publick
council or trick of State, there are
&s;everal of their order, (I think about
twelve, whom they call <HI>Ogiack A|galer</HI>)
con&s;tituted as &s;o many Tri|bunes
to take care of them. The&s;e
Agitators are the men whom they
re&s;pect as their Patrons and defen|ders,
and who have &s;uch a great
power and influence upon them. If
they give but the word, they are
pre&s;ently up in arms, and the <HI>Pi|azzas</HI>
and Streets are full of &s;e|ditious
tumults, and the <HI>Seraglio</HI>
it &s;elf not &s;afe from their a&s;&s;aults.
For they know well enough that
the Government is jealous of their
&s;trength, that it is in their power
either to depo&s;e or make what Em|peror
they plea&s;e, that they are the
&s;afeguard of the Empire; that <HI>O&s;man</HI>
uncle to this Emperor had a de&s;ign
of de&s;troying their whole order, and
&s;etting up another, which &s;hould be
more at command and not &s;o dange|rous
to the publick, as they are up|on
<PB N="128" REF="72">
every di&s;content; that his &s;ucces|&s;ors
carry on the &s;ame evil de&s;igns
again&s;t them, and that it is want of
a good opportunity, that hinders
them from putting the &s;ame in exe|cution
and practice. Whence ari&s;e
their care and their fears; and pro|portionably
their pride and in&s;olence
and extravagant demands of greater
priviledges encrea&s;e, and the di&s;trust
they have of the Emperor makes
them unite more clo&s;ely and &s;hew a
greater regard and re&s;pect to their
officers, who manage their intere&s;t.
They are wholly exempt from the
civil juri&s;diction, be the crime never
&s;o directly contrary to the Laws;
they are only triable among them|&s;elves:
if it be judged and pro|ved
capital, before they execute
the &s;entence, they fir&s;t &s;trike his
name out of the Regi&s;ter, and then
do it privately and in the night, to
prevent the di&s;orders this unruly
&s;ort of men are too apt to be guilty
of. In every City and large Town,
where they abound, there is a &s;upe|rior
officer, whom they call <HI>Serdar,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="72">
to who&s;e juri&s;diction they are ob|noxious.
He according to his or|ders,
&s;ent either from the <HI>Vizir</HI> or

tho&s;e who are within his Province,
and di&s;po&s;es of them according to
the exigences of the pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances.
If any quarrel happen
among them&s;elves, they mu&s;t &s;tand
to his deci&s;ion; before him they
can only be impleaded by others;
and the partiality they &s;hew to them
is &s;o great, that it is much better
to take an injury patiently, than to
go about to redre&s;s it by a com|plaint,
which oftentimes too is re|&s;ented
and revenged. Such an opinion
they have of them&s;elves, that
they think they may do any thing,
and for all that go unpuni&s;ht.</P>
<P>It is the grand concern of the
Emperor to make a wi&s;e choice of
a General over the&s;e ma&s;terful Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gene|ral of the <HI>Janizaries.</HI></NOTE>
of who&s;e fidelity he may re&s;t a&s;&s;u|red,

Among their Baggage there

education.</P>
<P>Before they engage, if there be
any opportunity, the <HI>Surat</HI> or Chap|ter

from Heaven to exterminate and
de&s;troy all who &s;et them&s;elves a|gain&s;t

vigor and force, that they fight in
the defence of <HI>Gods</HI> cau&s;e, which
makes them look upon cowardi&s;e
and faint-heartedne&s;s as a &s;in. For
who can be &s;o ba&s;e and unworthy
as not to be ambitious of dying at
<PB N="140" REF="78">
&s;uch a time, when they are the
Champions of God? The &s;ignal be|ing
given, they run upon their ene|mies
with the name of <HI>God</HI> in their
mouths, confusedly repeating it &s;e|veral
times, and invoking him to
a&s;&s;i&s;t and maintain his own cau&s;e,
which they are fighting for.</P>
<P>The doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI>
and Fate contributes not a little to
their fury; upon confidence of which
principle they expo&s;e them&s;elves to
certain dangers, believing them&s;elves
&s;afe in the mid&s;t of them, if <HI>God</HI>
has &s;o decreed it; which they do
not know, whether he has or no,
but by the event; and if &s;o, all
their warine&s;s and endeavours to
e&s;cape &s;ignifie nothing in the end.</P>
<P>They are convinc'd by a thou&s;and
examples before their eyes, that this
is the readie&s;t way to ri&s;e to a com|mand,
that there is a certain reward
due to valour, and that the <HI>Ba&s;&s;as</HI>
and all the other great Officers owe
all to their Scymitars. Thus &s;olici|tous
of fame and honour, they va|lue
not their lives in fighting, know|ing,
<PB N="141" REF="78">
that if they come off, they are
&s;ure to be preferred.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t effectual and effica|tious
machin to skrew up their cou|rage
to the highe&s;t degree and pitch
of de&s;peration is an opinion, which
by the artifices and in&s;inuations of
the Churchmen pa&s;&s;es for infallible
among the Souldiers, that whoever
dyes in the wars, is in the account
of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> a Martyr;
his death expiates and atones all his
&s;ins of what nature &s;oever; that ip|&s;o
facto he merits the joys and plea|&s;ures
of Paradi&s;e, and his Soul &s;hall
not be kept to attend upon the body
in the grave, to undergo the exami|nation
of the two Angels, which
they are &s;o terribly afraid of. A <HI>Muf|ti</HI>
being con&s;ulted in what order the
followers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> &s;hnuld enter
into Paradi&s;e, determined it in fa|vour
of the Souldiers &s;lain in the
wars, that they were to have the
precedence; then the hone&s;t plow|men;
afterward the Lawyers and
Prie&s;ts; and the re&s;t promi&s;cuou&s;ly
without any order at all, as they can
<PB N="142" REF="79">
pa&s;s and get in in the croud. Ani|mated
with the&s;e hopes, they are
almo&s;t unwilling to live; no danger
terrifies, death does not mate their
courage; the plea&s;ant and wanton
thoughts they entertain of their
Fools Paradi&s;e do &s;o run in their
minds.</P>
<P>They &s;hew the &s;ame, if not a
greater, courage in keeping a forti|fication,
where they have fixt their
Half-Moon Standard; much more
a Town or City, where they have
built a <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI> when be&s;ieged by
<HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> chu&s;ing rather to under|go
all the hard&s;hips of a Siege, or
the mo&s;t di&s;mal con&s;equences of an
a&s;&s;ault, then any way think of a
&s;urrender. This is a mighty piece
of Religion among them, that <HI>Ma|hometani&s;m</HI>
may loo&s;e no ground;
rather than &s;o, they will peri&s;h, not
only without complaint and mur|mur,
but willingly and with joy
too. Such a fatal ob&s;tinacy are
they wrought up to by their &s;uper|&s;tition.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="79">
The great wa&s;ts, which are made
by plague and war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Slaves.</NOTE> are &s;upplied by
the Slaves which are continually
brought into the Empire, and by
the multitude of women allowed by
the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> It is enough
to rend any heart, that gives way
to the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of pity, to
con&s;ider the &s;ad condition of poor
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Captives in <HI>Turkey.</HI> They
are chiefly brought in yearly by the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> who make excur&s;ions into
<HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> for &s;everal days
journeys, and upon their return
&s;weep and carry all before them;
&s;everal Ships laden with them in
the Ports of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> (the
old name of <HI>Euxine</HI> being wholly
lo&s;t and forgot) in the months of
<HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> arriving at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI>
This is the great Mart for
Slaves, where they are &s;ure to meet
with a quick and a good Market,
for no commodity is more vendible
or merchantable. Or el&s;e they are
brought along with the <HI>Caravans</HI>
from the farthe&s;t parts of the Em|pire
in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> out of <HI>Georgia</HI> and
<PB N="144" REF="80">
<HI>Mengrelia;</HI> wholly intent upon their

this kind of &s;poil, advance the pub|lick
intere&s;t of the <HI>Turks;</HI> that part
of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> which they ravage,
being much weakned by the lo&s;s of
thou&s;ands, thus barbarou&s;ly carried
into captivity, and their own Em|pire
enlarged and &s;trengthened by
&s;uch great acce&s;&s;ions. For few ever
return to their native Country; and
fewer have the courage and con&s;tan|cy
of retaining the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Faith,
in which they were educated; their
education being but mean, and their
knowledg but &s;light in the principles
and grounds of it; whereof &s;ome are
frighted into <HI>Turci&s;m</HI> by their im|patience
and too deep re&s;entments
of the hard&s;hips of the &s;ervitude;
others are enticed by the blandi&s;h|ments
and flatteries of plea&s;ure the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Law allows, and the al|lurements
they have of making their
condition better, and more ea&s;ie by
a change of their Religion: having
no hopes left of being redeemed,
<PB N="145" REF="80">

their <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and &s;oon forget
their original Country, and are no

pa&s;s for natives. Every <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI>
morning they are expo&s;ed publick|ly
to &s;ale, like &s;o many Hor&s;es or
Sheep in a Fair, in a peculiar place
of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which has the

where u&s;ually they put the women.
Here I have &s;een, not without hor|ror
and confu&s;ion of mind (for pi|ty
was too mean a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;oon
&s;wallowed up with &s;o di&s;mal and

artifice the Patrons think to put
<PB N="146" REF="81">
them off at better rates; feeding
them well before hand, that they
may look plump and fat, and &s;eem
to be in good ca&s;e, and putting them
on hand&s;om clothes, the better to
attract a Chapman. There is &s;carce
a <HI>Turk,</HI> if he be of any fa&s;hion, but
has one Slave at lea&s;t, and &s;ome of
them twenty, according to the great|ne&s;s
of their e&s;tates, and the occa|&s;ions
they have of them. They are
their proper goods, and let them
out to hire &s;ometime; whatever they
get, is their Ma&s;ters, who have an

It is intere&s;t more than good
nature and humanity which makes
them u&s;e them well, and puts them
upon providing clothes, victuals,
and whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain
life, that they may yeild them the
better &s;ervice, and for fear they
&s;hould &s;icken and dye; which would

changes and traver&s;es of fortune,
they may be &s;oon &s;tript of all; they
will not lo&s;e one jot of their gran|deur,
but mightily pride them&s;elves
in it. In their Hou&s;es indeed they
do not con&s;ult pomp and beauty,
&s;o much as largene&s;s and conveni|ence;
their riches is more to be
&s;een in their Stables than in the fur|niture
of their Rooms. No Porti|cos,
no Courts laid out in exact
proportions, no Galleries adorned
with co&s;tly pieces of art, nothing

being chiefly lookt after;
their diet too is cour&s;e and mean,
and far from luxurious, and little
differing from that which ordinary
per&s;ons content them&s;elves with.
Their magnificence appears in the
<PB N="148" REF="82">
number of their Women, of their
Servants, and of their Slaves. Being
bred up Souldiers, their care and
glory is to provide for the &s;ecurity
of their Provinces by &s;tores of Arms

get an excellent breed of <HI>Arabian</HI>
Hor&s;es, who&s;e race they will run
you up to &s;everal &s;cores of years;
and to have a con&s;iderable number of
brave, tall, and well proportion'd
young men to mount them, and to
be of their con&s;tant retinue. In this
piece of gallantry they &s;trive who
&s;hall out-do the other; which they
think is true greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>The law confines them to a &s;et
number of Wives;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Women-Slaves al|lowed.</NOTE> but for Women-Slaves
they are left to their own
choice and liberty. They may heap

e&s;tate will and can give way to. It
is wholly indifferent of what Reli|gion
they be, &s;o they be not very
<HI>heathen.</HI> Over them they have a
full power, and can di&s;pose of them
according to their humour and plea|&s;ure;
and &s;end them to the Market,
<PB N="149" REF="82">
when they are weary of them; it
being no unu&s;ual thing for a poor
mi&s;erable <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> woman to be
&s;old five or &s;ix times. I ob&s;erved a
piece of cunning in the <HI>Jews,</HI> who
are well ver&s;ed in all the little tricks
and &s;hifts of gain, and who u&s;ually
thrive under all Governments, where|ever
they are tolerated: They buy
little Girls of five or &s;ix years of
age at the rate of thirty or forty
Dollars, and are mighty careful in
their education; teaching them to
dance and &s;ing, and in&s;tructing them
in all the &s;orts of a winning beha|viour;
and the advantage they re|ceive
does fully an&s;wer their labour
and expence; the&s;e accompli&s;hments
rendring them valuable at twenty
times more than what they co&s;t;
being oftentimes taken into the <HI>Se|raglio,</HI>
or into the Families of the
<HI>Ba&s;&s;as,</HI> the ordinary <HI>Turks</HI> having
not wherewithall to make &s;uch a
purcha&s;e. And the&s;e mindful of the
kindne&s;s of their Educators, who&s;e
chief de&s;ign was their own profit,

of their preferment, do them, by
the intere&s;t they get in their re&s;pe|ctive

them &s;ometimes, with a black Eu|nuch

<P>Fury and impatience oftentimes

under the <HI>Cadyes</HI> hand, that they
are free-men. Upon the ab&s;ence and
flight of a Slave they give notice far
and wide, and order &s;everal to watch
at Bridges, which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
pa&s;s. When I pa&s;&s;'d the
Bridge laid over the <HI>Cay&s;ter,</HI> not
far from <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> too deep to be
forded, &s;everal <HI>Turks</HI> had fixt their
&s;tation there, hoping at that pa&s;s to
intercept the Slaves they were in
que&s;t and pur&s;uit of, and taking us
to be as good <HI>Mu&s;ulmans</HI> as them|&s;elves,
de&s;ired us, that if in our travels
we met with any &s;uch, whom they
de&s;cribed, we would &s;top them
and carry them before the next <HI>Ca|dy.</HI>
But for all this care on the one
<PB N="152" REF="84">
&s;ide, and hazard on the other, &s;ome
are &s;o happy to get away, and are
mightily favoured in it, by the
<HI>We&s;tern Chri&s;tians</HI> e&s;pecially, in a
Sea-Port Town, when the Ships are
upon their departure for <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom.</HI>
There is &s;uch a vi&s;ible appea|rance
of Providence in the following
&s;tories, that I &s;hould not pardon my
&s;elf if I omitted them. A poor <HI>Ru&s;s</HI>
Lad, about twelve years old, being
evil intreated of his Ma&s;ter, was re|&s;olved
to try his fortune, and upon
the next opportunity in the evening
&s;tole away. He gets ha&s;tily over
the water out of the City, altoge|ther
ignorant whither he went; a
good providence carried him to a
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Village about a mile from
<HI>Pera;</HI> he wanders up and down as
a Stranger, not knowing in that &s;ad
perplexity of mind, where he was,
or what he had to do, being equally
afraid to go or &s;tay; it hapned,
that one of our <HI>Druggermen</HI> had at
that time bu&s;ine&s;s there, and ea&s;ily
gue&s;&s;ing him to be a poor <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
run away from his Ma&s;ter, the Lad
<PB N="153" REF="84">
confe&s;t it, and beg'd of him for
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;ake to take pity on him.
The good man promi&s;ed him to take
care of him when it was a little dar|ker,
when he could do it with grea|ter
&s;ecurity, and with better hope of
&s;ucce&s;&s;. About an hour and a half
in the night, he brought the Boy to
our Hou&s;e to ki&s;s my <HI>Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador</HI>'s
Ve&s;t; immediately he was
put into a Livery, and a Perruke
given him, and kept within doors
for &s;ome time: but after he began
to talk <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he walked the &s;treets
&s;ecurely; &s;o di&s;guised in his looks
and habit, that if his <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ma|&s;ter
had met him, he would not
have known him, he pa&s;&s;ing for
one who had come out of <HI>England</HI>
with us. The other is this, A few
days before we &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Italy,</HI>
lying at Anchor in the Bay of <HI>Smyr|na</HI>
about a League without the Ca|&s;tle,
about midnight the Seamen,
who were upon the Watch, heard
a mournful voice of one in the wa|ter,
calling for help; they immedi|ately
run to the &s;ides of the Ship,
<PB N="154" REF="85">
and &s;py one almo&s;t quite &s;pent with
&s;wimming, and ready to &s;ink through
wearine&s;s; they throw out a Rope,
and get him aboard. We then lay
fourteen miles from the City, and
about a mile and a half from the
&s;hore. When they had recovered
him with &s;trong-water and a warm
bed, he told us next day, that he
was a poor <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> of
nineteen or twenty years of age,
who was re&s;olved to make u&s;e of
that opportunity of recovering his
liberty; that he got in the evening
out of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and kept along the
&s;hore, till he came to the place over
again&s;t which our Ship rode: a calm
Sea and a bright Star-light night fa|voured
the bold adventure, &s;o that
he had the Ship always in his eye;
but the di&s;tance deceived him, pro|ving
greater than he expected. He
throwing away his upper Ve&s;t into
the Sea, that it might be no hinde|rance
to him in &s;wimming, committed
him&s;elf to the goodne&s;s of <HI>God</HI> and
the water, and with much a-do got
to us. We put him into <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="85">
habit, like one of the Seamen; but
for his and our greater &s;ecurity, the
<HI>Turki&s;h Cu&s;tomers</HI> being within a
day or two to &s;earch the Ve&s;&s;el, le&s;t
they &s;hould give us or the Merchants
any trouble, if they found him with
us, our Captain de&s;ired the Com|mander
of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War,
that lay in the Bay, to receive him
till we &s;et &s;ail: within four days,
when we were out of all danger, we
received him again, and brought
him for <HI>England.</HI></P>

contraband, for <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> which
he made &s;ure of, as lawful prize, and
promi&s;ed him&s;elf an ea&s;y victory.
The poor Mariners who knew the
danger, and the inconvenience they
were put to for want of Sea-room,
being not able to turn and wind
their Ships, were re&s;olved however
to fight and die, rather than tamely
yield; there was no hope of flight,
or &s;afety, or victory; which made
them the more de&s;perate. He &s;ends
them an in&s;olent &s;ummons to deliver
up them&s;elves immediately; other|wi&s;e
he would beat their Ships
about their ears; and threatens
them with pre&s;ent death. This mo&s;t
di&s;mal accident, in&s;tead of abating,
increa&s;ed their &s;trength, and made
<PB N="167" REF="91">
them the more furious. The <HI>Turks</HI>
fight for prey, the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> only

whole Nation for the mi&s;fortune of
it, though it hapned above forty

as he can, either by money or vio|lence,
into his hands, and u&s;ing them
with all imaginable cruelty and de|&s;pight
to plea&s;e his Father's angry

diffu&s;ed his evil influence in the
juice. No, tho&s;e who were to be
Champions of the <HI>Almighty</HI> were
to be grave and &s;ober, and not any
way expos'd to the danger of lo&s;ing
their rea&s;on, or having their &s;ouls
defiled with &s;o prophane a liquor.</P>
<P>This he pretends was the com|mand
of <HI>God,</HI> which might ea&s;ily
enough prevail upon a blocki&s;h and
&s;tupid people, wrought upon by his

this &s;ati&s;faction, (though their
ta&s;te could not but be affected with
the plea&s;antne&s;s, and &s;weetne&s;s and
refre&s;hing qualities of Wine,) and
even force their very natures and in|clinations
to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I expected to have found them
as ab&s;temious as they have been
fam'd to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But not|with&s;tand|ing this prohibiti|on, the <HI>Turks</HI> gene|rally de|bauched with it.</NOTE> and that no &s;uch thing

and <HI>Jews:</HI> but I quickly
<PB N="170" REF="93">
found, that riot and the love of Wine
were too &s;trong for their fir&s;t belief
and education; and that the incli|nations
of Sen&s;e had beaten down
the commands of Religion; that
generally all, not only the <HI>Renega|dos</HI>
but natural <HI>Turks,</HI> Citizens and
Souldiers, were exce&s;&s;ively given to
it; except the Prie&s;ts and old men,
and &s;uch as had been at <HI>Mecca,</HI>
who&s;e age, and profe&s;&s;ion, and man|ner

doing a thing &s;o indecent and &s;can|dalous;
and that a man could not
do a <HI>Turk</HI> a greater civility and
kindne&s;s, or more oblige them, than
by giving them Wine. For the &s;ake
of this they would vi&s;it the hou&s;es
of <HI>Christians,</HI> and not be &s;atisfied
without it. They are for the pure
blood of the grape, and wonder at
our &s;poiling the Wine by our mix|tutes
of water, and think they have
not drank enough, till they are able
to drink no more. The late <HI>Vizir</HI>
him&s;elf was not free from this vice
of exce&s;&s;ive drinking. For being per|&s;waded
(much about the time of the
<PB N="171" REF="93">
taking of <HI>Candia</HI>) by his Phy&s;ician a
little to tran&s;gre&s;s the law of his
Prophet for his health &s;ake, he no
&s;ooner had ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of
Wine, (for till that time he was ut|terly
ignorant whether it were &s;weet
or bitter) but he loved it ever after;
and was almo&s;t angry with his Pro|phet,
for forbidding a liquor &s;o
grateful to the palate; as I believe
he was with him&s;elf, for living in ig|norance
&s;o long: it being his con|&s;tant
practice, upon his return from
that Island, to indulge him&s;elf in it
in the afternoon, when he had dis|patched
the weighty affairs of the
Empire, relying, I &s;uppo&s;e, upon the
&s;trength of a Proverb that holds as
true in <HI>Turkey</HI> as in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI>
That he who is a wi&s;e man in the day,
will not be accounted a fool at
night.</P>
<P>This defection was &s;o gro&s;&s;, gene|ral,
and notorious, that it alarm'd
the <HI>Church-men,</HI> and filled them with
anger and zeal, which broke out in
bitter invectives; they thunder out
of their Pulpits, that their Religion
<PB N="172" REF="94">
and Empire were both like to be at
an end &s;peedily, that the violation
portended nothing but ruine and de|&s;olation;
that the crime grew to
that exce&s;s and height, that it &s;eem|ed
almo&s;t to be above expiation. But
the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> no way moved with
their zeal, drink on &s;till. At la&s;t a
certain Prie&s;t, one <HI>Vani Ephendi,</HI> fa|mous
for his eloquence, and who had
gained a mighty opinion in the
<HI>Court</HI> for his preten&s;ions to extraor|dinary
piety, (con&s;is&s;tent, by the pra|ctice
and law of the Countrey, with a
multitude of women, which he kept)
upon <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s birth-day, took the
liberty in an harangue before the
Emperor, to put him in mind of the
quarrels of the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> occa|&s;ioned
by this devilli&s;h liquor, al|mo&s;t
in his very &s;ight, and near his
Tent; that this was of evil Omen
to the Government; that the &s;tate
of affairs were in an ill condition;
that <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> were highly
angry and offended at the practice of
&s;o much lewdne&s;s, which was uni|ver&s;ally

<HI>Greeks</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> received the

that there is no <HI>God</HI> but
<HI>God,</HI> and that <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his Pro|phet.

them in their agonies, and expre&s;s
it by their looks and by their moan;
but when once they are dead, their
mourning and trouble are at an end;
they cea&s;e from all complaints, and
&s;carce a &s;igh to be hard, looking up|on
this, as a finding fault with the de|cree
of <HI>God</HI> Almighty and a re&s;i&s;ting
his will. The dead body is perfu|med
with Frankincen&s;e, carefully
wa&s;hed with clean &s;oap and warm
water, and &s;owed up in linnen: un|le&s;s
towards the head and feet,
(which are left free, that the per&s;on
may &s;tand on his legs, and &s;hew him|&s;elf
in the grave, when he gives an
account of his faith to the <HI>Examin|ing
<PB N="197" REF="105">

ground. They have not the art of
embalming. Their Funerals are &s;o|lemnized
without Ob&s;equies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fu|nerals.</NOTE> no
&s;hew, or pomp, or expence in the

u&s;ually in the morning; deriding
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who at &s;uch times carry
lighted Tapers and Torches, and the
Prie&s;ts their Cen&s;ers, and hire wo|men
to cut and tear their hair, and
is a nece&s;&s;ary part of the &s;olemnity.
The Prie&s;t u&s;ually goes before the
corps mumbling out &s;omewhat, who
&s;ays peculiar prayers for the &s;oul of
the dead per&s;on at his grave; nigh
which he &s;tands alone by him&s;elf,
the re&s;t about twenty foot di&s;tant,
and there reads &s;ome &s;hort Chapters
of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Then he gravely
admoni&s;hes him about the funda|mentals
of his Religion, that the
<HI>Angel Inqui&s;itor</HI> may not &s;urprize
him, and find him unprepared with
&s;utable an&s;wers; and that he boldly
confe&s;s that <HI>God</HI> is the Creator, and
<HI>Mahomet</HI> his Me&s;&s;enger, and that he
u&s;ed in his prayers to turn his face to|wards
<PB N="198" REF="106">
<HI>Mecca,</HI> and the like; which
ceremony being fini&s;h'd, they lay the
body in the ground, and wi&s;h the
man a good &s;ucce&s;s in his examina|tion.
Their care and re&s;pect is not
confined to the grave; for they be|&s;tow
Money to the poor to pray for
their &s;ouls, which they believe find
ea&s;e and benefit by their &s;uffrages,
and often go them&s;elves to their
graves, out of love and re&s;pect to
their memory. Some Emperors and
great men have left lands for the&s;e
very purpo&s;es, that the&s;e religious
offices may never be omitted. Their
women are not permitted to be pre|&s;ent
at a Funeral; only the la&s;t day
of <HI>Ramazan,</HI> as I &s;aid before, they
are allowed to go to the publick
burying places. The&s;e burying-pla|ces
are without the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their bu|rying-pla|ces.</NOTE> and u&s;ually
nigh the high-way; &s;omewhat per|chance
for pomp and more for u&s;e,
to put pa&s;&s;engers in mind that they
mu&s;t dye al&s;o, and &s;erve for exam|ples

broken pieces of pillars (which for|merly
belong'd to <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Chur|ches)
or great &s;tones, &s;ome of which
are between four and five yards
high, as I found by mea&s;ure in the

doing any po&s;&s;ible injury to the
dead; their bones lye quiet and un|di&s;turbed;
they do not dig up a
grave a &s;econd time; every one has
his grave apart; no mixture of a&s;hes
or bones, which are as &s;afely pre|&s;erved
as if they were in di&s;tinct
urnes and peculiar vaults and repo|&s;itories:
The &s;epulchral monuments
of the great men are made of free|stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tombes.</NOTE>
well cut and &s;moothed, in the
fa&s;hion of a che&s;t, who&s;e cover is
taken off, with a &s;tone-step running
round and jetting out. Both &s;ides
are adorned with gilt circles, and
one at each end, the intermedial
&s;paces being filled up with flowers,
very hand&s;omely wrought; for here
<PB N="200" REF="107">
as in their cielings they &s;hew their
&s;kill of engraving and painting.
Statuary and drawing a mans face
they do not pretend to in the lea&s;t;
this being altogether unlawful; which
makes them &s;o bruti&s;hly fierce a|gain&s;t
all humane figures, whether
wrought by the chezil or pencil. In
either of the extremes is placed a
pillar, which ri&s;ing from a &s;quare, ends
in a cone; on the tip of which is plac'd
a turbant, or a cap, &s;uch as the women
wear, to di&s;tinguish who&s;e the mo|nument
is. The&s;e monuments are
in the open air. The Emperors and
great men lie buried in Cities, in co|vered
Chappels, which they have pur|cha&s;ed
&amp; built for this very purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>An Oath is of great force with
them in deciding pecuniary and ca|pital
cau&s;es;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Oaths.</NOTE> they lay their hands
upon the <HI>Alcoran</HI> and call <HI>God</HI> to
witne&s;s to the truth of what they
&s;hall atte&s;t, which they ki&s;s and then
put to their forehead, having fir&s;t
wa&s;hed their hands; for no unclean

appeared, and was very willing
to take his Oath, as he could do
mo&s;t con&s;cientiously and religiou&s;ly;
but they wanted a book to &s;wear
him, which put a &s;udden &s;top to the
conte&s;tation and trial; after much
&s;earch among the neighbouring

<HI>Latin</HI> book, which they took for
the Go&s;pels; He quickly perceiving
what it was, began to refu&s;e, till his

this account, told him, that &s;uch a
&s;crupulo&s;ity would &s;poil the cau&s;e,
and make the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;u&s;pect the
truth of his te&s;timony; that it was
brought there in&s;tead of the book
of the Go&s;pels, and that it was be|lieved

<PB N="202" REF="108">
was the &s;ame thing in effect, as if

are not worth being recited or

about fifty &s;ix paces in length, and

fixt within the body of the

to clear the earth where they are
fixt, and the broken pieces &s;erving
their purpo&s;e as well; which is to
place them at the extremities of
their graves: abundance of which
we found in their burying-places in
our travels where ever we came. Un|der
the Ea&s;t end, a large Vault. On

building, the one exactly agreeing
with the other. The doors very
high; oppo&s;ite to which is a great

<P>It is called by the <HI>Turks Alah

be under&s;tood only in reference to
the &s;ituation; for there is nothing
of building in it to make it de&s;erve
that name. A City formerly of as

<PB N="241" REF="127">
three &s;trong walls toward the plain;
a great part of the inmo&s;t wall yet
&s;tanding, though decayed and bro|ken
down in &s;everal places, with &s;e|veral

after a long di&s;tance the <HI>Philadel|phians</HI>
having made &s;everal &s;allies,
but all in vain, to remove and rai&s;e
the &s;iege, it was forced to &s;ubmit to
the fate of other Cities, and became
a prey to the barbarous Conqueror,
who was not wanting in cruelty to
expre&s;s his revenge and furious rage
again&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Citizens for
daring to with&s;tand &s;o long his victo|rious
arms: there being about a

South, a thick wall of mens bones
con&s;u&s;edly cemented together with
the &s;tones; in all probability rai&s;ed
<PB N="242" REF="128">
by his command: (for &s;ure none but
&s;uch a Barbarian would have done
it) in complyance perchance with
&s;ome ra&s;h vow that he had made,
when he lay fretting and &s;torming
before it. The Churches felt the
terrible effects of his fury as well as
the inhabitants; mo&s;t of them be|ing
demoli&s;hed and turned into dung|hills;
as it that of St. <HI>Johns</HI> to the
South-ea&s;t, mo&s;t probably the Ca|thedral
for its largene&s;s, where they
throw their rubbi&s;h and filth, and
the re&s;t made Mo&s;chs. South|ward
is the river <HI>Cogamus</HI> flowing
from the hill; abundance of Vine|yards
all along, which the poor
<HI>Greeks</HI> u&s;ed to cultivate, but were
at that time deterred from making
Wine, by rea&s;on of the &s;evere prohi|bition
of the <HI>Grand Signor;</HI> &s;o that
here, as a <HI>Greek Pappas</HI> told us,
they had &s;carce wine enough for the

there being above five hundred
<HI>Janizaries</HI> in it, who according to
their priviledges (the government
being &s;o much in their favour) can
<PB N="243" REF="128">
be judged only by their <HI>Serdar</HI> or
Captain; the <HI>Cady</HI> or Civil Gover|nour
having no power over them in

has the greate&s;t number of
<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> above the other Metropo|litical

when it &s;tood, it was one of the mo&s;t

in the times of idolatry with &s;o much

the title of the <HI>holy City&punc;</HI>
which it had at fir&s;t, derived from
the hot waters flowing from &s;everal

the City &s;o famous; and for this
cau&s;e <HI>Apollo,</HI> whom both <HI>Greeks</HI> and

refer the learned Reader to the <HI>La|tin</HI>

<P>By this &s;hort and imperfect &s;ur|vey
the curious Reader may be &s;ad|ly
convinced, in what a pitiful and
deplorable condition the&s;e once fa|mous
and glorious Churches of <HI>A&s;ia</HI>
are at this day; Churches, which
had the <HI>Apostles</HI> for their Founders,
and which yielded &s;o many Martyrs,
and which abounded with &s;o many
myriads of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who&s;e pati|ence
and valour tired out and weari|ed,
and at la&s;t triumphed over the
tyranny, the malice, and the hatred
of their <HI>Heathen</HI> per&s;ecutors; and
which afterward, when the Empire
became <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and the civil power
&s;ubmitted it &s;elf to the law and di&s;ci|pline
of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and when the Cro&s;s,
which before was had in &s;uch exe|cration,
was held the highe&s;t orna|ment
of the Crown, advanced in
&s;plendor and glory above what they
had enjoyed in the times of <HI>Heathe|ni&s;m,</HI>
&amp; which upon a due con&s;idera|tion
of circum&s;tances one might have
<PB N="274" REF="144">
truly enough judged &s;hould have
been eternal and placed almo&s;t out
of all po&s;&s;ibility of danger and ru|ine,
now turned into heaps of rub|bi&s;h;
&s;carce one &s;tone left upon
another, &s;ome of them utterly un|inhabited,
and the remains of all
horribly frightful and amazing. I
&s;hall not here lament the &s;ad traver|&s;es
and vici&s;&s;itudes of things, and
the u&s;ual changes and chances of
mortal life, or upbraid the <HI>Greeks</HI> of
luxury and &s;tupidity, which have
brought the&s;e horrid de&s;olations up|on
their Countrey: the&s;e are very
u&s;eful but very mean and ordinary
&s;peculations. That which affected
me with the deepe&s;t angui&s;h and
mo&s;t &s;orrowful re&s;entment when I
was upon the place, and does &s;till,
was and is a reflexion upon the
threat made again&s;t <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> men|tioned
in the &s;econd Chapter of the
<HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> who made
his abode in that City, and died

the &s;ad and direful calamities which
