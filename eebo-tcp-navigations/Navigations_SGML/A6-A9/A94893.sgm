<P>GOod God! What a complication of Im|piety, Bla&s;phemy, Contradiction, Ex|travagancy, and Folly, is there in this <HI>Oath,</HI> and how Guilty are both tho&s;e, who Swear &s;uch an <HI>Oath,</HI> and tho&s;e who pre&s;cribe it to be Sworn!</P>
<P>We &s;ee by this <HI>Oath,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King prays to <HI>God</HI> to pro&s;per the <HI>Sultan's Reign;</HI> and en|gages to do his utmo&s;t endeavours to promote his Intere&s;ts again&s;t his <HI>Enemies,</HI> who are the Chri&s;tians, and to be their <HI>Enemy</HI> in the <HI>Turks</HI> behalf; and <HI>in ca&s;e he neglects to do it,</HI> he con&s;ents to be <HI>an Apo&s;tate from the Chri&s;tian Faith;</HI> that is, unle&s;s he &s;trives with all his power to overthrow the <HI>Chri&s;tian Intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Go&s;pel, he will be an Apo|&s;tate from the Chri&s;tian Faith. Nothing,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall be fraudulently done on my &s;ide.</HI> How! can there be any thing more fraudulent and treacherous, than to call God for a Witne&s;s of &s;uch an execrable <HI>Oath,</HI> contrived again&s;t God him&s;elf? Is it not a horrid fraud, to call the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> and the <HI>Bapti&s;m Holy,</HI> and at the &s;ame time, to &s;ay, that in ca&s;e he does not him&s;elf all what in him lies to de&s;troy both; <HI>the Go&s;pel,</HI> and <HI>the Chri&s;tian Faith will be fal&s;e.</HI> But we are much beholding to him for his Moderation, in <HI>committing</HI> only <HI>Fornication upon the Altar,</HI> tho' he does it <HI>with La&s;civi|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> for he might as well for ought I know, have committed the Crime of <HI>Sodomy.</HI></P>
<P>A Prince, who offers to do &s;uch Things as are mentioned in this <HI>Oath,</HI> in ca&s;e he does not keep &s;uch an abominable <HI>Oath,</HI> is guilty of all tho&s;e Crimes already; and does no better, than if he had &s;aid, <HI>I Swear by the Mo&s;t High God,</HI> to Kill <HI>my Father and my Mother, and all my Relations, and in ca&s;e I do not perform my Vow, I am re&s;olved to &s;ay there is no God;</HI> &s;uch is the Religion of <HI>the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>Francis</HI> the I. who, fir&s;t of all the <HI>French</HI> Kings, took this a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>Oath,</HI> as it is reported by the <HI>French</HI> Hi&s;toriographer <HI>Du Ribier, in his Memoirs;</HI> he was then in|gaged in a War again&s;t <HI>Charles</HI> the Vth Empe|rour, &s;o that he thought fit to make an Al|liance with the <HI>Turks,</HI> to get &s;ome Succour
<PB REF="2">from them; and indeed, they &s;ent a great Fleet and Army to help him, under the Com|mand of their Admiral and General <HI>Barba|ro&s;&s;a,</HI> who Landed in <HI>France;</HI> and did in <HI>Provence</HI> and the County of <HI>Ny&s;&s;a</HI> great mi&s;|chiefs, more a great deal than to the Empe|ror's Subjects. <HI>Du Ribier</HI> reports, that none in the <HI>French</HI> King's Council oppo&s;ed this <HI>Oath,</HI> but only <HI>Chancellor du Prat,</HI> who was mightily again&s;t it, but could not prevail, &s;o that it was taken by <HI>Francis</HI> accordingly.</P>
<P>But it may be, &s;ome will &s;ay, tho <HI>Francis</HI> the I&s;t. took that <HI>Oath,</HI> it is not certain, that <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth. has taken it, in making Al|liance with the <HI>Turks.</HI> I confe&s;s indeed, no Hi&s;toriographer has relate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> as has been done of his Pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 chunk"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> 'tis no wonder, for &s;uch things are carefully kept &s;ecret during his Life, and &s;hall not be known before his Death; Methinks there is little Rea&s;on to doubt he has done it al&s;o, or &s;ome other wor&s;e, and this for the following Rea|&s;ons. 1&s;t. It is the con&s;tant practice of all the Princes and States, when they have once prevailed upon another State to Treat an Alliance with them, upon Terms, and Forms, and Expre&s;&s;ions Favourable, Advantagious, and Honourable to their own Party, never to change any thing of them in the following Treaties or Alliances with the &s;ame, unle&s;s there has been a great Change made al&s;o in the re&s;pective Fortunes of tho&s;e States, and that which was the le&s;s potent then, is become the more powerful or predominant. We do not &s;ee there has been any &s;uch alteration or mutation made among&s;t tho&s;e two great Nations, the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Turks;</HI> and this has certainly &s;till as great advantage now over <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth, as &s;he had over <HI>Francis</HI> the I&s;t, when he took this <HI>Oath.</HI> 2. <HI>Francis</HI> the I&s;t. was certainly, as appears by his Hi&s;tory, far le&s;s Ambitious, and a Better, and Greater Man in all re&s;pects, than <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth ever was. 3. There mu&s;t needs be a horrid Ingagement between them, again&s;t the Chri|&s;tians, &s;ince we &s;ee every year, what efforts the <HI>French</HI> King makes again&s;t <HI>Germany</HI> in the <HI>Turks</HI> behalf, and that the <HI>Turks</HI> per&s;i&s;t in continuing this War, &s;o extremely ruinous to them, again&s;t their Cu&s;tom. But howe|ver it be, it can be ea&s;ily proved, he has done much wor&s;e in that re&s;pect, than his Prede|ce&s;&s;or ingaged to do, &s;o that we cannot do him any injury, in thinking he has taken the &s;ame <HI>Oath,</HI> or a wor&s;e one, if po&s;&s;ible. For &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth, has not taken the &s;ame <HI>Oath,</HI> yet it cannot be denyed, that he is more guilty, for having done without <HI>Oath,</HI> what <HI>Francis</HI> the I&s;t, had ingaged by <HI>Oath</HI> to doe, but did not actually perform it. This took that <HI>Oath,</HI> Tran&s;ported with a great Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t <HI>Charles</HI> the Vth, Emperour, but the other does it in cold Blood. And we do not &s;ee by <HI>Francis</HI> his Hi&s;tory, he has done any great mi&s;chief to Chri&s;tians, in be|half of the <HI>Turks,</HI> comparable to what <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth has done. 'Tis wor&s;e ten times to commit a Crime without threatning; than to threaten without committing of it.</P>
<P>By all the Tenour of this pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> King's Conduct, we &s;ee he has Sworn, I know not how many <HI>Oaths</HI> upon the <HI>Holy Go&s;pel</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> in &s;everal Alliances and Trea|ties with mo&s;t States in <HI>Europe,</HI> and with his own Subjects al&s;o, and has broken as many times his <HI>Oaths.</HI> This is as much as to &s;ay, the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith are fal&s;e,</HI> and to <HI>deny that Chri&s;t is Living.</HI> When he does condemn one year by all his Univer&s;ities, the <HI>Pope's Infallibility,</HI> and his <HI>Authority above the Council,</HI> his <HI>Power over the Temporals of Princes, and of Depo&s;ing them when he plea&s;es;</HI> and another year admits the <HI>&s;ame Infallibility of the Pope,</HI> and his <HI>Almighty Power</HI> both in <HI>Heaven and Earth, &amp;c.</HI> Is it not as much as to &s;ay, the <HI>Go&s;pel is fal&s;e,</HI> and <HI>the Chri&s;tian Faith,</HI> a trifle? When he pretends to impo&s;e Laws upon Mens Con&s;ciences, and force them to believe what he plea&s;es, and will be called by the Name of <HI>Providence,</HI> of <HI>Immortal,</HI> of <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty,</HI> is it not as much as to <HI>cur&s;e the Go&s;pel and the Chri&s;tian Faith?</HI> As for his being a <HI>&s;pecial Friend</HI> to the <HI>Turks, and an Enemy to his Enemies,</HI> every body knows what mi&s;chiefs he has done to <HI>Germany,</HI> in behalf of the Infidels, and how he helps them with all kind of Officers and Engineers again&s;t the Emperour, the <HI>Polonians,</HI> and <HI>Venetians,</HI> and has exhau&s;ted almo&s;t all the Mony of his Kingdom for their &s;ake, po&s;tponing his own Subjects Intere&s;t, to theirs, and treating them as Enemies to the <HI>Turks:</HI> So that 'tis evident, he mu&s;t have taken his Predece&s;&s;or's <HI>Oath</HI> with the <HI>Turks,</HI> or &s;ome other more execra|ble <HI>Oath,</HI> &s;ince he has done a great deal wor&s;e, and is without Compari&s;on more Ambitious, and Irreligious than <HI>Francis</HI> the I&s;t was, and &s;tands in greater need of the <HI>Turks</HI> help, for his unju&s;t De&s;igns.</P>
<P>We have here al&s;o a true Character of the <HI>Turks</HI> Genius, who pre&s;cribed the <HI>French</HI> King &s;uch a Contradictory and Bla&s;phemous <HI>Oath,</HI> upon which they could not rely in the lea&s;t, if they had had any Hone&s;ty or Judgment. For how could they imagine, that a Man profe&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian, and calling the <HI>Go&s;pel Holy,</HI> and <HI>the Bapti&s;m Holy,</HI> &amp;c. would oblige him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly and in earne&s;t, to deny all the Truths of the Go&s;pel, in ca&s;e he failed him&s;elf of his word; that is, to believe that God &s;hould be fal&s;e, becau&s;e he &s;hould have been fal&s;e him&s;elf. For 'tis ju&s;t the &s;ame, as if a Chri&s;tian Prince, did exact from the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;uch an <HI>Oath,</HI> whereby the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;hould Swear by his Holy <HI>Alchoran,</HI> and the Holy <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith, and by his Great Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that he would be faithful to Chri&s;tians, in de&s;troying the <HI>Mahometan</HI>'s Intere&s;t; and in ca&s;e he did neglect to do it like a Knave, <HI>Mahomet</HI> would be a Knave al&s;o, and his <HI>Alchoran</HI> a Fable, and that he would hereafter Wor&s;hip a Hog in his <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> and commit Adultery upon <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb. Certainly, no Man of any Hone&s;ty or Judg|ment, would impo&s;e &s;uch an <HI>Oath</HI> upon any other Man. The <HI>Turks</HI> did it only out of a blind and inveterate aver&s;ion they bear to the Chri&s;tian Religion; they pretended to rai&s;e thereby a great Triumph to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> over our Saviour. For how is it po&s;&s;ible other|wi&s;e, to tru&s;t to &s;uch an <HI>Oath,</HI> which none but a Treacherous and Unworthy Man can take, of what Religion &s;oever he may be?</P>
