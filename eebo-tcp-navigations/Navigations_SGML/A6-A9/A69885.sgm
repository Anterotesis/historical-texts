<P><PB N="2" REF="6">
It is in length from <HI>Berwick</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI>

<P>As concerning its Name and its Fir&s;t In|habitants,
Hi&s;torians have left us in &s;o great
an uncertainty, that we &s;carce know what
to re&s;olve on; but we need not wonder at
&s;o great an Ob&s;curity, if we con&s;ider that
the Fir&s;t Inhabitants of Countries had other
Cares to employ their Thoughts, than to
deliver their Beginnings to Po&s;terity; and
po&s;&s;ibly had they been never &s;o willing &s;o
to do, they could not have effected it, &s;ee|ing
their Life was &s;o uncultivated and void
of all Literature, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble
for them to pre&s;erve the Memory of
things, and to make over the &s;ame to &s;uc|ceeding
Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">
Be&s;ides their <HI>Druides</HI> and <HI>Bardi,</HI> who Re|hear&s;ed
and Sung the Actions of their He|roes,
not only like other Heathen Prie&s;ts
Monopolized that little Learning they had
wholly to them&s;elves, and were by this
means the only Per&s;ons &s;uppos'd to be able
to give an account of what was pa&s;t,
thought it not lawful to Write any thing.</P>
<P>Nor indeed have we any better account
of ancient times, even in tho&s;e Civiliz'd
parts of the World, wherein Learning chief|ly
flouri&s;hed, when a profound Ignorance
over&s;pread the face of <HI>Greece</HI> its &s;elf, as well
as other Nations; for if we would take the
pains to enquire &s;trictly into the matter, we
&s;hall there find as much darkne&s;s and ob&s;cu|rity
as to their Original, as in the&s;e our <HI>Eu|ropean</HI>
Parts.</P>
<P>What Fabulous Stories would the &s;ubtle
<HI>Greeks</HI> impo&s;e upon us if we had the Faith
to believe them? Who (as a Learned Father
of our Church affirms) had not learn'd to
&s;peak plain truth till the World was about
3173 Years old; for &s;o it was when the
<HI>Olympiads</HI> began.</P>
<P>If we would enquire further into the
Succe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Latins,</HI> and would take
the trouble to examine the two fir&s;t <HI>Dyna&s;ties</HI>
the fir&s;t before <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s coming into <HI>Italy</HI>
and the &s;econd of the <HI>Aeneadae</HI> after; fo
certainly it will be &s;ufficient ground to que+&s;tion
<PB N="5" REF="7">
the account of times before, if in the
third <HI>Dyna&s;ty,</HI> when the Succe&s;&s;ion &s;eems &s;o
clear, and &s;o certain an <HI>Epocha</HI> as the Build|ing
of <HI>Rome</HI> to deduce their accounts from,
their Chronology be yet uncertain; for &s;e|veral
of their be&s;t Hi&s;torians make no &s;cru|ple
to confe&s;s, That no certain account can
be given of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was 25 Years af|ter
the Olympiads, and but <HI>752 Ante Chri|&s;tum,</HI>
till the <HI>Regi&s;ugium,</HI> which was
268 Years <HI>Ante Chri&s;tum</HI> 384.</P>
<P>A fair account then we are like to expect
concerning the fir&s;t ri&s;e of our own Nation,
after &s;o many revolutions of Ages, where|in
Truth &s;eems, as it were, more and more
to have withdrawn her &s;elf from us; which
to trace out, we mu&s;t again return to the
<HI>Romans,</HI> who are the be&s;t able to &s;atisfy us
in this ca&s;e,</P>
<P>This is mo&s;t certain, that the account of
Times before the <HI>Romans,</HI> either in <HI>Italy,
Germany, Old Gallia,</HI> or <HI>Brittain,</HI> is &s;carce &s;it
to be di&s;cour&s;ed of under any other Head,
than that of Impo&s;tures; not that I think
that the&s;e Nations had lain in a perpetual
&s;leep till the <HI>Romans</HI> rous'd them with their
Swords, and waken'd them, as I may &s;ay,
into &s;ome kind of Civility; but that they
had no certain uniform way of conveying
the Tran&s;actions of their own, and former
times, to the view of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
On which account we may very ju&s;tly
reject all tho&s;e pretended Succe&s;&s;ions of <HI>Go|mer</HI>
and <HI>Brute,</HI> as Fabulous; as al&s;o that
this I&s;land was Inhabited by Giants; with
a great many other, I know not what,
pretty Stories, adapted to the Ignorance of
tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>However, all Hi&s;torians agree in this,
That it is highly probable that the fir&s;t In|habitants
of this I&s;land were Originally de|&s;cended
from the ancient <HI>Gauls,</HI> (that part
of the World being long Inhabited before
this) which is &s;ufficiently apparent from
the re&s;emblance of their Government,
Manners, Conditions, Buildings, Habits,
and the Community of their Language,
which is the &s;ure&s;t proof a Nations Ori|ginal.</P>
<P>As for its Name, the mo&s;t probable Con|jecture
is, That it was termed <HI>Brittain</HI> from
<HI>Brit,</HI> which in the ancient <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Language
&s;ignifies Painted, and the word <HI>Tain,</HI> which
denotes a Nation; agreeable to the Cu&s;tom
of the ancient <HI>Brittains,</HI> who u&s;ed to di&s;|colour
and paint their Bodies, that in their
Wars they might &s;eem more Terrible to
their Enemies.</P>
<P>We are inform'd by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> in his
Commentaries, That it was Governed at
fir&s;t by &s;everal petty Rulers and Princes, of
different Intere&s;ts and Coun&s;els: He Land|ed
<PB N="7" REF="8">

but was repuls'd by <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ibelan,</HI> a Bold and
Warlike Prince, who was Cho&s;en King, or
rather <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo,</HI> by the Unanimous Con|&s;ent
of the other <HI>Roytelets,</HI> to repel the com|mon
Enemy.</P>
<P>He afterwards made &s;everal Inroads into
it, but without any great Succe&s;s; he in
the end being forc'd to leave it to the Go|vernment
of its own Kings. <HI>Augu&s;tus, Ti|berius,</HI>
