<P>_I Did intend the publi&s;h|ing of this fir&s;t Book of the <HI>Kingdome,</HI> or <HI>Seve|ral Counties of</HI> England, together with another of <HI>The Kings of</HI> England. But the Book|&s;eller de&s;ired to put forth this fir&s;t alone.</P>
<P>I have made much u&s;e of <HI>Cam|den,</HI> and if I could have added to his Chorography, &s;ome new and me|morable things of each County, which he had not ob&s;erved, I &s;hould have thought it might have been u&s;efull for a native <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> and Foraign|er.
