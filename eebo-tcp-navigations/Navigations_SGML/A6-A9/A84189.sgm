<HEAD>An exact and true RELATION IN Relieving the re&s;olute garri&s;on of LIME in Dorcet&s;hire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have written one Letter to you &s;ince I came in|to this <HI>Bay.</HI> Ye&s;terday I received yours of the 24 of <HI>May,</HI> rejoycing much in that health which God plea&s;eth yet to continue to you and my familie at home. I thank God I am well, onely much &s;ad|ne&s;&s;e of &s;pirit is contracted from the &s;ad &s;pectacle that be&s;ieged <HI>Lime</HI> doth continually offer to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> view; a Towne that de&s;erves abundance of pittie and love, they being &s;till under the violence of a cruell Enemie. Captaine <HI>Pine,</HI> of who&s;e wounding I writ to you in my la&s;t, is &s;ince dead: God brought my Lord hither to a &s;ingular purpo&s;e, it tending to &s;ave that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Towne hitherto, having not in it at his Lord&s;hips comming, above two dayes bread, and a &s;mall quantitie of Ammunition. There are in the Towne 4000 &s;oules, whereof 1000 in G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rri&s;on; who though they want Shooes, Stockings, Clothes? and pay, and have not departed from <HI>Lime</HI> &s;ince the beginning of the &s;iedge; yet are all of them re&s;olved
<PB N="2" REF="3">to &s;tand out to the la&s;t man: and when they can doe no more, to breake through the Enemie with their &s;words.</P>
<P>At my Lords fir&s;t comming, he &s;ent on &s;hoare neere 40 barrells of Powder and &s;ome Match, which came along with his Lord&s;hip purpo&s;ely for their reliefe. The Ships under his Lord&s;hips commands did before his comming, &s;pare what Provi&s;ions they could, none comming to them from other parts, and the pa&s;&s;ages by Sea being neer blockt up, his Lord|&s;hip contracted, for 350 pounds worth of Come and other Provi&s;ions, being then bound for <HI>Plymouth</HI> to be &s;old there, and tooke order to &s;end it into the Towne, him&s;elfe undertaking the price.</P>
<P>The condition and courage of the be&s;ieged did &s;o prevaile with our Sea-men, that on Saturday la&s;t, out of their poore overplus, they &s;ent them above 30 paire of Boots, 100 paire of Shooes, 160 pure of Stockings, &s;ome Linnen and old clothes, and &s;ome quantitie of Fi&s;h and Bread, that they had formerly, &s;aved out of their Sea allowance. They did al&s;o una|nimou&s;ly give one fourth part of their bread for the next foure moneths, amounting to 9000 weight, which their hard labour and con&s;tant cutie might ad|vi&s;e them to have re&s;erv'd rather for their own bellies. On Monday la&s;ts my Lord and the Ships with him, determin'd to &s;pare them 2000 weight of bread more, and &s;ome quantities of Beefe, Porke, Shot, Fi&s;h, and other nece&s;&s;aries. That day &s;ome of our Sea-men were de&s;ired by the Towne to looke to the <HI>Lyme,</HI> while 600 of the Garri&s;on &s;allyed on the Ene|mie, and 300 men were re&s;olved to be &s;ent; but the
<PB N="3" REF="3">&s;ame day the Towne received a terrible for me from the Enemie, yet with little advantage to the be&s;iegers, they 100 &s;ing about 60. and the Town but eight, one|ly &s;ome of their Comanders were then hurt, <HI>viz.</HI> Colonell <HI>Ware</HI> was &s;hot in the bellie, but not dange|rou&s;ly, and Lieutenant Colonell <HI>Blake</HI> was &s;lightly hurt in the foot. The Towne&s;men of the three Cap|taines that led up the forlorne hope, killed one Cap|tain <HI>Southern,</HI> who had on the Lord <HI>Paulets</HI> own Ar|mour, and tooke pri&s;oner another, <HI>viz.</HI> Captaine <HI>A&s;ton,</HI> who was the next day brought aboard our Ship. This Captaine <HI>A&s;ton</HI> is brother to a &s;ervant of Ma&s;ter <HI>Ketchmar</HI> in <HI>Fi&s;h &s;treet:</HI> the Enemie refu&s;ed to take off their dead, re&s;olving to burie them, and to take the Towne altogether. But God afterwards corrected their daring &amp; pre&s;umptuous Cruckie. The Garri&s;on being in couraged by this &s;ucce&s;&s;e, re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute their former purpo&s;e of &s;allying, and in pur&s;uance thereof, on Tue&s;day night la&s;t, the 300 men were &s;ent &s;afely on &s;hoare, though to make good their landing 3 or 4 of the Town&s;men were &s;hin, On the &s;ame Tue&s;day, his Lord&s;hip determin'd to &s;end two of his Sips, &amp; all the &s;hip-boats futed with men towards <HI>Char<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">outh, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">port,</HI> &amp; other places about &s;ix miles fro~ <HI>Line,</HI> that the Enemies opinion of our land|ing men in tho&s;e parts, might draw off the hor&s;e, where|by the &s;allie would be more &s;ecure and advantagious. And on Wedne&s;day la&s;t the &s;hips and boats were ac|cordingly &s;ent out, at a time &s;ignified from the towne by &s;hooting off a Gun from <HI>Daves</HI> fort and giving an alarme on the Ea&s;t &s;hoare, obtained what was in de|&s;igne. For all the day long, foure or five troopes of
<PB N="4" REF="4">hor&s;e, and &s;ome hundreds of foot, attended the mo|ving of the &s;hips and boats, from whence diver&s;e great &s;hot and &s;mall &s;hot played into lands, which forced the enemie to ca&s;t up a bre&s;t-work by the &s;ea &s;ide for their owne defence. The enemie mi&s;tooke the inten|tion, &s;uppo&s;ing that the&s;e boats had in the night taken men out of the Towne, with purpo&s;e to &s;et them on &s;hore, for getting of provi&s;ions into the Towne, or to fall on the reare; and thereby thinking the Towne to be weakned, they did on the &s;ame Wedne&s;day neere the time appointed for &s;allying, a&s;&s;ault the Towne with great &s;urie: from about &s;ixe at night to about eight at night, there was &s;uch a continuall peale of &s;mall &s;hot and great &s;hot, that the Towne &s;eemed to be all on a flame; twice the enemie made an orderly retreat, appearing each time in a body of about a thou&s;and men. The third a&s;&s;ault was mo&s;t violent, the enemie advancing with brave re&s;olution, and be|ing as gallantly received by the Towne&s;men. A little after eight of the clock there was a remitting of the former furie; and about nine, an almo&s;t generall &s;ilence. There was &s;laine of the enemie in this a&s;&s;ault, as &s;ome of the Towne this day aboord computed, foure hundred; and of the garri&s;on, but &s;ix or &s;even kild and wounded, whereof Major <HI>Townsend</HI> was one, who was &s;hot in the head, but is &s;till alive. Among&s;t the &s;taine, there was found one Gentlemen that came that morning from <HI>Exeter</HI> with Letters for <HI>Oxford,</HI> whither he would faine have carryed the newes of the taking of <HI>Lyme,</HI> but God prevented him, and the Let|ters found in his pocket are &s;ent to <HI>London;</HI> the prin|cipall thing imparted by them being, that they heard
<PB N="5" REF="4">the wayes to <HI>Oxford</HI> began to be ob&s;tructed; that the Queene was better then formerly, and much com|forted in Doctor <HI>Mirons</HI> comming on Sabbath day la&s;t.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day la&s;t there was a parley in the Towne, the enemie de&s;iring to burie their dead, which before they &s;corn'd.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday &s;ome reliefe came for the Towne by Sea, and in the afternoone part of the Towne was fired, yet but three hou&s;es burnt. This day another part of the Towne was fired, and at this in&s;tant the fire en|crea&s;eth, and twentie new hou&s;es are burnt.</P>
<P>You may now judge the &s;tate of poore <HI>Lyme,</HI> but if you &s;aw it as it is continually before us, your eyes would much affect your ba&s;te, con&s;idering that &s;uch gallant &s;pirits, worth a Nation indeed, &s;hould be the &s;ubjects on which the rage and madne&s;&s;e of a ba&s;e and cruell enemie is from day to day exerci&s;ed and im|printed.</P>
<P>If <HI>London</HI> knew their merit and condition, I am confident they would not only compa&s;&s;ionate them, but relieve them: what is wanting in men, will bee made up I hope by the power and providence of hea|ven, who&s;e &s;alvation hath him hither to appointed by God, for their wals, and bulwarkes &s;omethings I may not omit, that at the late &s;torming, one woman &s;hot off 16 Mu&s;quets upon the enemy, and the wo|men of the Town generally did fill the Souldiers Bandileres while they &s;ought: the continuance of their dangers having much blunted the &s;ence of their dangers, retaining in their &s;pirits a con&s;tant cheere|fulne&s;&s;e, as knowing they &s;hall have deliverance,
<PB N="6" REF="5">ther from the affliction, or by it: and to all let mee adde, that this mercy to them was the re&s;ult. I doubt not of the prayers put up at the in&s;tant on their be|halfe, from aboard as well as in other parts of the Kingdome.</P>
<P>We have taken upon the &s;eas &s;ince our &s;etting from the <HI>Downs,</HI> 2 prizes, one a <HI>Dartmouth</HI> ve&s;&s;ell, laden with oyle and &s;alt for <HI>Holland,</HI> and the other was brought into us on Saturday la&s;t which was a Dutch Galliot laden with commodities for the enemie at <HI>Aptham,</HI> and <HI>Exceter,</HI> to the value of 8000 <HI>li.</HI> and the Ma&s;ter of the Galliot him &s;elfe confe&s;&s;ed, that they had for her more &s;afe convoy of the company of two States men of War, who had aboard their &s;hips 5 barrels of money amounting to 1000 Dollars, confined to &s;ome malignants in <HI>Exceter:</HI> the factor under who&s;e charge the money went committed, being aboard the men of war, was loath to be di&s;covered, but at length being apprehended, and brought before his Load&s;hip was for &s;ome peremptory &s;peeches to my Lord put in &s;afe cu&s;tody the goods will prove undeniable prize.</P>
