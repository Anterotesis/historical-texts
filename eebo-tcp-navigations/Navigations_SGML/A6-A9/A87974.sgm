<P><HI>PAR Dieu,</HI> I am undone, undone for ever; and bloodily afraid, that our <HI>good Cau&s;e</HI> (which we have jointly carried on &s;o long) will now (on a &s;ud|den) fall to the Ground: For, alas, alas, I mu&s;t let you know, that my <HI>Invincible Armado</HI> hath mo&s;t unhappily rancounter'd with an <HI>Engli&s;h Drake,</HI> who hath publickly evinc'd, to the unlooking World, That <HI>I can be Over-come.</HI> O wo, wo to me! what &s;hall I do? I &s;hake and tremble, I quake with a panick Fear; and the Violence of Pa&s;&s;ion, at the fir&s;t receiving of this amazing Di&s;a&s;ter, hath again occa&s;ion'd the tormenting <HI>Fi&s;tula</HI> in my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Ano.</HI> What &s;hall I do? what &s;hall I do? I'm undone, undone, undone, every where be&s;et with implacable Enemies, and my utter Ruin is nigh at hand. Enraged <HI>Neptune</HI> doth di|&s;tract me at Sea, and thundering <HI>Mars</HI> afrights me at Land. From Abroad I'm &s;trangely terrify'd with the very thoughts of my <HI>formidable Adver&s;aries;</HI> and at Home I continually dread the ri&s;ing of the <HI>unruly Mob.</HI> To all which add, that my Gho&s;tly Father at <HI>Rome,</HI> hath long ago declared me a Ba&s;tard, and &s;ays, <HI>That I no ways belong to the Holy See.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, I'm for&s;aken both by God and Man! I have pray'd to S. <HI>Denis</HI> twice, but he hath not heard me; and S. <HI>Ignatius</HI> (I think) is fallen a&s;leep. All my <HI>Beads</HI> and <HI>Gaudes</HI> do now avail me nothing; and a thou&s;and <HI>Ave Maries</HI> are &s;aid, but all in vain.</P>
<P>Thus (my deare&s;t Brother) I do let you know of the&s;e my perplexing Circum&s;tan|ces, be&s;eeching you (for the &s;ake of <HI>Mahomet's Sleeve</HI>) to a&s;&s;i&s;t me now in this my greate&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P><HI>Great Sir;</HI></P>
<P>I need not tell you that my Enemies are al&s;o yours, and that yours are truly mine. I beg it of you, that you would be plea&s;ed to cau&s;e your great <HI>Mufti</HI> grant me the be|nefit of his Prayers; and that in all ha&s;te imaginable he would di&s;patch &s;ome Lamen|ting Pilgrim to the famous <HI>Mecca,</HI> to &s;alute in my Name the &s;plendid Sepulchre of your great Prophet, a&s;&s;uring him of my faithful Allegiance for the future, and that henceforth I will no longer act the part of an Hypocrite, (that being in all probabili|ty &s;ome Cau&s;e of my pre&s;ent Ruine) but will publickly own his noble Principles, and that in the Face of the Sun, &s;till carrying before my marching Armies, a glitter|ing <HI>Cre&s;cent,</HI> with the following Motto, <HI>In hoc vince;</HI> and (to the utmo&s;t of my Power) I will propagate the Holy <HI>Alcoran</HI> through the We&s;tern Parts of the Heretical World. I need not tell you of my fervent Zeal to that meritorious Work, you being fully convinc'd thereof long ago. I am not able to write one Word more at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Grief overwhelms my drooping Spirit: Therefore (my deare&s;t Bro|ther) I do, again and again, reque&s;t your pre&s;ent A&s;&s;i&s;tance. And expecting an An|&s;wer with the fir&s;t convenience, do &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Copy</HI> of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s ANSWER to the <HI>French King</HI>'s LETTER, &s;ent to him in all ha&s;te by the Flying Po&s;t.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and di&s;con&s;olate Brother;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received your Lamenting Letter by the fore&s;aid Po&s;t, and am heartily &s;or|ry at your woful pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances; but a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, that I will truly A&s;&s;i&s;t you to the utmo&s;t of my Power. And that you may be fully convinced of my Sympathy with your &s;ad Condition, I do hereby give you my Royal Word, that for three Days to come I will ab&s;tain from being Drunk with <HI>Claret Wine.</HI> And that my great Concern for you may farther appear, I'le command a publick Fa&s;t to be kept through all my Dominions, &s;trictly charging my dutiful Sub|jects, that (when they'r be&s;t at lea&s;ure) they may con&s;ecrate at lea&s;t half a Day for publick Mourning and Humiliation; enjoining a &s;evere Penance on any Per&s;on who will dare to eat Meat twice before Dinner that day. And to avoid all &s;ign of Joy or Rejoicing what&s;oever, I'le promi&s;e you, that (during our Humiliation) no <HI>Bell</HI> &s;hall be toll'd in any of my Sacred <HI>Mo&s;ques.</HI> And, finally, for your farther Comfort, I am fully re&s;olv'd to denounce open War again&s;t the great Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> and that becau&s;e it doth &s;o abound with that nau&s;eous Fruit called <HI>Oranges,</HI> a Fruit mo&s;t dete|&s;table to your Sacred Palat.</P>
<P>But &s;ince all this (though very great Comfort indeed) doth not an&s;wer the chief End of your Epi&s;tle, (it being pre&s;ent A&s;&s;i&s;tance you want) I do hereby let you know, that in that Point I'le fully &s;atisfy you al&s;o. <HI>Courage, courage,</HI> Brother, there's no fear; Are not you <HI>Louis le Grand,</HI> and I <HI>Seignior le Grand?</HI> the Devil's in't if we maul not the Rogues now. Your Per&s;onal Va|lour hath &s;ounded all the World over; pray therefore rou&s;e up your &s;elf now at this Time, a Time of &s;o great Danger to our Sacred Cau&s;e: Come, come (Brother) chear up your mu&s;ing Mind, and fear nothing at all. It's true, you want both Ships and Money at pre&s;ent; and what then? can't I furni&s;h you with both? Yes truly, and I will do it. You know (Brother) I de|&s;igned to have done great Things upon the <HI>Danube</HI> this Summer, but that devili&s;h Pa&s;s near <HI>Or|&s;oway,</HI> hath utterly ruin'd my De&s;ign. Now &s;eeing that it is &s;o, I can freely &s;pare you my whole Fleet of <HI>Barks</HI> and <HI>Boats,</HI> (e&s;pecially tho&s;e that your &s;hallow Seas can well admit of) where|by you may be able, not only to re-ingage, but (I hope) al&s;o to defeat your Enemies: Therefore I de&s;ire, that upon the receiving of this my Letter, you will cau&s;e in&s;tantly di&s;patch an Expre&s;s to your Royal Harbour at <HI>Barfleur,</HI> commanding three of your be&s;t Ships (namely, the <HI>Royal Sun,</HI> the <HI>Conquerant</HI> and <HI>Admirable</HI>) to meet my Fleet at the <HI>Straits</HI> Mouth, and from thence to conduct them &s;afe to the Engli&s;h Channel; and then if we chance only to get but one &s;ight of the Rogues, the Day will certainly be our own, I'le warrant it; yea, <HI>(par ma foy &amp; en verit&eacute;)</HI> I can take my Oath upon it. As for Money (Brother) fear not, I'le furni&s;h you with your own <HI>Lui|dores,</HI> with which you formerly gifted me in &s;o great Abundance: Pray fear not, you &s;hall have true French Gold, and that as much as I can &s;pare. You tell me, in a mo&s;t tragical manner, that you are ruin'd both by Sea and Land; your whole Kingdom being in a dreadful Con&s;ternation at pre&s;ent, and the greate&s;t part of your Fleet either &s;unk or burnt; &s;o that Earth, Water and Fire, do &s;eem all at once to fight again&s;t you. What then (Brother) have you forgot all your Philo&s;ophy? Are there not four Elements? make ha&s;t therefore, and fly &s;peedily to the <HI>Prince</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> and betake your &s;elf to his Royal Protection, and pre&s;ently e&s;tabli&s;h a firm League, Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive, with him; I &s;ay, do it pre&s;ently before he hear of all your Di&s;a&s;ters, le&s;t then he be unwilling to con&s;ent unto it. Make ha&s;te, and quickly di&s;patch your great Tru&s;tee the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Luxenburgh,</HI> his good Friend and old Acquaintance; for if any Man in the World prevail, it will be him. I de&s;ire to be a Member of that Noble Confe|deracy my &s;elf; &s;o that being Three in Number, I hope we &s;hall prove the Invincible <HI>Tri|umviri.</HI> But, pray ob&s;erve one thing, that we mu&s;t both give the precedence to this our great Friend: But to comfort you (Brother) by all means you &s;hall &s;it next to him; &s;o that in your Imperial Dets, our Royal Writs &s;hall be thus &s;uper&s;crib'd,
<Q>Lucifer le Grand, Louis le Grand, Seignior le Grand,</Q> Every one <HI>Le Grand.</HI> Are not the&s;e confounding <HI>Titles,</HI> enough to conquer the VVorld it &s;elf, &s;uppo&s;e we never &s;trike a Stroke? Yes truly, and that without any Miracle too. A&s;&s;ure your &s;elf therefore of a mo&s;t glorious <HI>Triumph</HI> over all your perplexing Foes, which is the con&s;tant Prayer and hearty VVi&s;h of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MONSIE&V;R,</SALUTE>
