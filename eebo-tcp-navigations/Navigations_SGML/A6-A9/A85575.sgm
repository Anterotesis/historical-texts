<HEAD>A great VICTORY Obtained By the Engli&s;h again&s;t the Hollander on Thur&s;day near the I&s;le of Wight.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday la&s;t, from very clean hands, we re|eived a mo&s;t exact and fair account of the pro|ceedings of our Navy at &s;ea, and that they are again put forth, and became Ma&s;ters of &s;everal prizes: but purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate; for one of our Frigots hath been extreamly ingaged, with the Hollander, and her main-ma&s;t, and mi&s;n, both taken off by chain-&s;hot; &s;he maintained a very gallant di&s;pute for many hours, but at la&s;t being overpowred was forced to tack about, and &s;trike into Port&s;mouth, with the lo&s;&s;e of &s;ome men; the Free-booters are extream bu&s;ie, and have tru&s;&s;ed up &s;ome of our &s;hips near Berwick; laden with excellent commo|dities; but on the contrary we have taken divers of the
<PB N="4" REF="3">Flemings; among&s;t the re&s;t divers Am&s;terdam Merchants laden with Wines, Sugar, Salt, and other con&s;iderable prize: yet notwith&s;tanding the enemy &s;eems as re&s;olute as potent; for on Thur&s;day la&s;t, a great fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of about 50 &s;ail, began to act a new Tragedy upon the Neptune Ocean, neer the I&s;le of Wight; which the Eng|li&s;h perceiving, prepared to receive them, and according|ly 30 gallant men of war hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and bore up to them: and after a &s;harp conflict expelled their powers, and forced them to decline engagement, and after two hours cha&s;e, &s;unk four, took eleven, and di&s;&s;ipated the re&s;t: but not without lo&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>From &s;everall parts beyond the &s;ea this week thus. The Senatours with the King of Denmark are yet at Copenhagen, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e that make up the Na|tional Senate, are &s;ummoned to appear within a time li|mited. His Maje&s;ty of Denmark hath al&s;o &s;ent Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to view all the fortifications on the &s;ea &s;ide, and to provide with all nece&s;&s;aries, as al&s;o given Com|mi&s;&s;ion to all the Officers of the Navy may be in a readi|ne&s;&s;e to &s;et forth upon any occa&s;ion; &s;ome of the Dutch &s;hips riding near Copenhagen did lately &s;eize upon three Dantzick &s;hips which were bound for O&s;tend, and having detained them &s;ome days upon pretence that they were bound for London, the parties grieved having made their addre&s;&s;es to the King, and made it appear that there was no &s;uch thing intended, the &s;aid &s;hips and goods were &s;et at liberty, and remained under the Kings protection, wai|ting for a fair wind to depart thence. The Queen of Swe|den and her Councel are very bu&s;ie in giving audience to &s;everal Emba&s;&s;adours both from Germany, as al&s;o from divers other Kings and States, they have made a Procla|mation to all the Senatours which are ab&s;ent to repair within a &s;et time to Stockholm, that &s;o with all conveni|ency
<PB N="5" REF="3">they may proceed to the choice of new Senatours, in lieu of tho&s;e that are lately dead: all things are now wor|king towards the general meeting at the Imperial Dyet at Ratisbon.</P>
<P>The long &s;iege of Barcelona is now come to an end, the Generalli&s;&s;imo Don Juan de Au&s;tria, and the Marque&s;&s;e of Mortara, General of the Spani&s;h army by land, having brought that City for want of provi&s;ions to make a com|po&s;ition, and thereupon to &s;urrender, which was done a|bout the latter end of September, after they had endured a very hard &s;iege for the &s;pace of fifteen moneths within which time there hath peri&s;hed a very great number of people, of all ages and &s;exes, by the &s;word, the Pe&s;tilence, and famine, and the fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e hath likewi&s;e de&s;troyed many of the be&s;iegers, &s;o that con&s;idering mo|ny &s;pent and men lo&s;t, the place is dear bought, as for par|ticulars we can &s;ay no more, but that they have honour|able terms granted. The French Vice-King with the Go|vernour of the City have liberty to march out with the re&s;t mentioned in the articles and are both gone to Perpig|nan, by the next we &s;hall give you a more particular ac|count. You have heard of the &s;urrender of the City of Ca&s;al to the Duke of Mantua the true owner thereof, but the Citadel &s;tood out, being kept by a French gari&s;on commanded by Mon&s;ier S. <HI>Angelo,</HI> who having refu&s;ed to &s;urrender upon the &s;ummons, the batteries were there|upon made ready, and the place being &s;tormed twice, the be&s;ieged con&s;idering their condition, and how little hopes there was of any relief, did at la&s;t come to compo&s;ition. which was granted them upon honourable terms, and &s;o they marched out, and had a convoy to bring them into Pi|edmont.</P>

<P> By Letters from Edenburgh, October 24. came thus. On Wedne&s;day the 20 in&s;tant, the Engli&s;h Commi&s;&s;ion|ers for admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice &s;ate upon criminal mat|ters at Edenburgh: The fir&s;t day was &s;pent in reading their Commi&s;&s;ion from the Commi&s;&s;ioners at Dalkieth, calling the Sheriffs of the &s;everal Counties on this &s;ide the Frith, viz. Barwick, Selkirk, Pebles, Linlithgow, Had|ington, Lothian and Roxborough. Tho&s;e Sheriffs that ap|peared not, were fined 200 l. Scotch each. Afterwards the Gentlemen of the Counties, who were to do their &s;ervice were called, and &s;uch as appeared not, fined 100 <HI>l.</HI> Scotch; and then &s;everal Delinquents were called, and &s;et down for tryal. Since that, the&s;e three days have been &s;pent in the tryal, and fining of &s;everal per&s;ons for Adul|tery, Ince&s;t, and Fornication, for which there were above three&s;core per&s;ons brought before the Judges in a day. And it is ob&s;ervable, That (&s;uch is the malice of the&s;e people) that mo&s;t of them were accu&s;ed for facts done divers years &s;ince, and the chief proof again&s;t them was their own Confe&s;&s;ion before the Kirk, who are in this wor&s;e than tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h Religion, who do not make &s;o ill an u&s;e of their Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ome of the facts committed 5, &s;ome 6, 10, 16, 18, and 21 years &s;ince. There was one Ephraim Bennet, a Gunner in Lieth, indicted, convicted, and condemned for coyning of Six|pences, Shillings, and half Crowns; al&s;o two Engli&s;h-men, Wilkin&s;on and Newcome, condemned for robbing and killing one Scotch man near Haddington in March la&s;t. But that which is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable is, that &s;ome were brought before them for Witches, two whereof had been brought before the Kirk, about the time of the Armies comming into Scotland, and having confe&s;t it, were turned over to the Civil Magi&s;trates. The Court
<PB N="7" REF="4">demanding how they came to be proved Witches, they declared that they were forced to do it by the exceeding torture they were put to, which was by tying their Thumbs behind them, and then hanging them up by them, whiles two Highlanders whipt them; after which they &s;et lighted Candles to the &s;oles of their feet, and between their toes, then burned them by putting lighted Candles into their mouths, and then burning them in the head; there were 6 of them accu&s;ed in all, four whereof died of the torture. The Judges are re&s;olved to enquire into the bu&s;ine&s;s, and have appointed the Sheriff, Mini&s;ters, and Tormentors to be found out, and to have an accompt of the ground of this cruelty. Another woman that was &s;u&s;|pected (according to their thought) to be a Witch, was kept 28 days and nights with bread and water, being &s;tript naked and laid upon a cold &s;tone, with onely a hair cloth over her. Others had hairy &s;hirts dipped in vinegar put on them to fetch off the skin. It is very probable there will &s;hortly be more di&s;coveries of this kind of Amboyna u&s;age, but here is enough for rea&s;onable men to comment upon.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day la&s;t, the Marque&s;s of Argyle came to Edenburgh, he had &s;o far perfected the work in the High|lands, that our pri&s;oners are relea&s;ed out of Carver&s;ara Ca&s;tle, (where about 60 of them were kept) 20 miles from Innerrara, where they had near peri&s;hed, had not they been allowed &s;ome of their own Bisket and Chee&s;e. The Marque&s;s of Argyle u&s;ed them very civilly at their comming by his hou&s;e, allowing them good quarters, &s;ome money to bear their charges, and giving them Pa&s;|&s;es through his Countrey.</P>

<P> The mo&s;t illu&s;trius Prince&s;s, the Queen of Sweden, hath &s;et forth a Proclamation, adjuring and commanding all her Captains and Officers of her Navy Royal, to yeeld obedience unto her &s;pecial Edict and Decree, for the protection and pre&s;ervation of the Engli&s;h &s;hips (commi&s;&s;ioned either by the titular King of Scots, or the Parliament) from the violence of the Hollander: and that they &s;hall likewi&s;e receive protection as well upon their Naval Affairs throughout the Baltick Seas, as with|in their own confines and territories; In pur&s;uance whereof, her Maje&s;ty hath given Order for 50 &s;ail of Men of War to be immediately &s;et forth, to attend the motion of the Engli&s;h and Dutch.</P>
