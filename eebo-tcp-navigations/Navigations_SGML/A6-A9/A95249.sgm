<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_LIttle Newes is to be expected, but God be ble&s;&s;ed it is good: Eight dayes &s;ince Lord <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> Lord <HI>Dygbie,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Folliat</HI> went to|wards <HI>Ca&s;tle Go&s;hel,</HI> where the Ladie <HI>Dygbie</HI> was be&s;ie|ged by the Rebels; and Sir <HI>Charles Coot</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">accompanyed them from the <HI>Naas;</HI> they were not 500. in all that went, which Ca&s;tle they relieved, hanged many of the Rogues, from thence they came to <HI>Trim,</HI> in the way tooke <HI>Phillips</HI> Towne, burnt it, and the <HI>Navan,</HI> relieved more Ca&s;tles by the way, tooke <HI>Trim,</HI> and abide there &s;till; a Garri&s;on of a 1000. Foot, and 500, Hor&s;e will be put there. It is a Towne of great con&s;equence, &s;ixe Ca&s;tles in it, all this while there was not 500. Men of ours, and they &s;aw above a 1000. of the Rebels, 6.7. or 800. in a place, in &s;ome places 1500. and not daring once to oppo&s;e our men, but runne away and gaze afarre off, Deere-like; this we mu&s;t not attribute to the &s;trength of man, but <HI>God</HI> mu&s;t be glorified in it.</P>
<P>La&s;t Saturday the <HI>Newrie</HI> was taken by the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> and the Scots, joyning to|gether, without lo&s;&s;e of one man, after they had been before it two or three dayes: for they were not willing to fight for feare of de|&s;troying the Engli&s;h Pri&s;oners, which the Rebels had in the Towne; at la&s;t they yeelded the Towne upon condition, what I know
<PB N="3" REF="3">not, and all the Pri&s;oners are freed; the chiefe Sir <HI>Edward Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ers,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Point,</HI> Cap|taine <HI>Smith,</HI> and many others, who have in|dured much &s;orrow. Sir <HI>Con. Mac. Genis</HI> was the chiefe of the Rebels there.</P>
<P>Now God be thanked the way is cleare in a manner betwixt this and <HI>Carickfargus.</HI></P>
<P>Some came from the <HI>Newrie</HI> this day, which is 44. miles, burnt <HI>Carlingford,</HI> which is 5. miles from the <HI>Newrie,</HI> and the Rogues are beaten in all places where they are met withall.</P>
<P>If we had now Men and Money here, I verily beleeve this Summer would be an end of this Rebellion, except it be &s;ome &s;trag|ling Rogues in Bogges and Woods. I pray God &s;end us good News from you, and for the pre&s;ent I cea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Sir</HI> Charles Coot <HI>was not here &s;ince he went fir&s;t out, doth continue at the</HI> Naas, <HI>where he doth fortifie and make Forts, and at the fir&s;t put out a Proclamation that all the Iri&s;h that were left there &s;hould depart the Towne in</HI> 24. <HI>houres, el&s;e be hanged. He hath many there at worke, Spinners, Glovers, Weavers, Knitters,
<PB N="4" REF="4">Tanners, and all kind of Trades, and all things is plenty there, abundance of Cattill, two quarts of Milke a penny; and he makes the Souldiers worke duely, and gives them 6 pence a day for their worke, be&s;ides their pay; hangs and kills all that he meets, of the Rebels.</HI></P>
