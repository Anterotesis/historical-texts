<HEAD>The Cau&s;es of the Publick Hatred of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h Nation.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The hatred of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> towards the Protestants, and their Religion.</HEAD>
<P>_TO &s;hun the &s;u&s;pition of fancy|ing to write <HI>Iliads</HI> after <HI>Ho|mer,</HI> I will not now make a large Martyrologie, which of it &s;elf, were enough to fix a Title to this Chapter; nor will I compile Hi&s;tories of the <HI>Belgick,</HI> or Low-Country War, e&s;pecially of that which was waged by the Duke of <HI>Alva;</HI> for tho&s;e are both &s;ufficiently known, and there is &s;tore of them to be had. This I &s;hall only &s;ay, and this for their &s;akes, who think the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will prove milder to them, becau&s;e they imagine to them|&s;elves, that they are included in the Paci|fication
<PB N="2" REF="6"> of Religion (they who are com|monly called by the envious name of <HI>Cal|vini&s;ts</HI> being excluded) then to the <HI>Refor|mats,</HI> as they term them; that they are &s;uperlatively mi&s;taken. For who&s;oever they be that differ in opinion from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whether in matter of Religion, or in order to their long-dream'd of <HI>Mo|narchy,</HI> are all alike to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The cruelty which the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> exerci&s;ed upon them of the <HI>Reformed Re|ligion</HI> in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> is notorious enough; yea, and him&s;elf, a little before his end, boa&s;ted, <HI>that by his command above eighteen thou&s;and per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ed through the hands of the Executioner, with different &s;orts of puni&s;hments, for Religions &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd, freely and boldly an&s;wered the Emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> his Cou&s;in-German by the Fathers-&s;ide (who, having &s;ent his Brother <HI>Charles</HI> in|to <HI>Spain</HI>) exhorted him to moderation in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, <HI>That he had ra|ther lo&s;e all his Provinces, then &s;eem to grant, or favour any thing, which might be prejudicial to the Catholick Religion.</HI> Thuan. lib. 133.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Pacification of <HI>Colein,</HI> 1580. were wont to &s;ay, <HI>That
<PB N="3" REF="6"> the Prote&s;tants would be well &s;erved, if they were &s;tript of all their goods, and for|ced to go &s;eek new Countries, like</HI> Jews, Egyptians <HI>and</HI> Nubians, <HI>who wander up and down like Rogues and Vagabonds, with|out any place of abode.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Citizens of <HI>Aquen&s;is</HI> had been much more mildely dealt with in the year, 1605 had it not been for the importunate flatteries of King <HI>Philips</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors, as <HI>Thuan.</HI> te&s;tifyes, <HI>lib.</HI> 133.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> once took the <HI>French</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Florida,</HI> and hanged them all with this title, <HI>This I do not as to</HI> French, <HI>but as to</HI> Lutherans. <HI>Camer. horis &s;ubce&s;&s;ivis,</HI> c. 98.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the year 1577. when by the Em|perors demand, there was a Conference appointed between the Kings Mini&s;ters, and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> the &s;aid Mini|&s;ters urged only this, <HI>That the liberty of any other Religion what&s;oever might be excluded out of the Low-Countries, and the Catholick only admitted,</HI> which was the cau&s;e of di&s;|&s;olving the Conference, <HI>re infect&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Ought the Count of <HI>Bructerons</HI> ca|lamity to be &s;ilenced, who&s;e Ca&s;tle the Admiral unju&s;tly, and violently &s;eized up|on, took his per&s;on pri&s;oner, ejected his
<PB N="4" REF="7"> wife and children, plundred his goods, kil|led the Countrymen whom he found there, yea, and wickedly murthered the very Count him&s;elf, together with his Kin&s;man, and a Preacher, contrary to his word which he had given them; and this for no other colour, but out of hatred to the Reformed Religion, which he mo&s;t con&s;tantly profe&s;t, and from which he would not be removed by any menaces what&s;oever. See <HI>Speculum Arragonicum,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Speculum Tragicum.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the year 1590. the 8. of <HI>March,</HI> made a Procla|mation at <HI>Madrid,</HI> wherein he declared, that after <HI>France</HI> was cleared, he would make War upon all &s;uch Provinces as were infected with any Sectarian Conta|gion. <HI>Ancellus apud Thuan.</HI> lib. 118. <HI>in oratione ad Principes Germaniae,</HI> 1570. where the words of the Proclamation are al&s;o recited.</P>
<P N="9">9. If there were no other example to be found of the Spani&s;h hatred again&s;t the Go&s;pel and Go&s;pellers, that mo&s;t cruel Fact of <HI>Alphon&s;o Dias,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> would &s;uffice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ex|ample of <HI>Dias.</HI></NOTE> who cau&s;ed his brother <HI>Juan Dias</HI> to be killed by his own Executioner, becau&s;e he embraced the Doctrine of the
<PB N="5" REF="7"> Go&s;pel, in the year 1546. and however the Law were pro&s;ecuted again&s;t the &s;aid Fratricide, he yet obtained his Pardon by the intervention of the Emperours Let|ters.</P>
<P N="10">10. The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by his Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> urged the Senate of <HI>Aquen&s;is,</HI> to bani&s;h them of the Reformed Religion out of the City, as <HI>Peter Beck</HI> a Canon of that City confe&s;&s;es, cap. 13. <HI>Comment. &s;ui de urbe Aquen&s;i.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Cardinal <HI>Granvellanus</HI> was often wont to boa&s;t, that he would reduce the Catholick Religion in all places, though a hundred thou&s;and men were to be burnt in an hour, and that he would begin with <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Orange.</HI> See <HI>Ga&s;par Grevinus, in &s;ua In&s;titutione,</HI> p. 192.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> the &s;econd, mo&s;t faithfully advi&s;ed, and in|treated the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to treat the <HI>Flemmings</HI> more gently in matter of Re|ligion, but he could obtain nothing, as him&s;elf writes in a certain Letter of his to <HI>Lazarus Swendius,</HI> 1579. the 22. of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> from <HI>Vienna.</HI> This Letter is to be read, <HI>lib.</HI> 16. <HI>Apoph. Baudartii.</HI> See al&s;o <HI>Speculum tyrannidis Hi&s;panicae in Belgio per totum.</HI></P>
<P N="13"><PB N="6" REF="8">13. And who ever either &s;aw, or heard of a greater fact of barbarous tyrannie, and hatred again&s;t Religion, then that which by the in&s;tinct of &s;ome ill In&s;tru|ments, the <HI>Archduke</HI> Albert <HI>committed, in a certain Maid called</HI> Anne Vandenho|ven <HI>at</HI> Bru&s;&s;els, <HI>whom he cau&s;ed to be &s;et quick in earth, and &s;mothered? Martyro|logium, Meteranus, Speculum Hi&s;p. Tyran. in Belgio.</HI> p. 91, 93.</P>
<P N="14">14. It may al&s;o be a mo&s;t &s;ufficient te|&s;timony of the hatred of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> (and chiefly the later) that when they have a mind to di&s;honour any one very much, or call him by any injurious name, they call him, <HI>Vellaco Lutherano,</HI> i. e. <HI>Lutheran Knave;</HI> &s;o that even by this reproach they who are willing, and glad to be &s;tiled <HI>Lu|therans,</HI> may be &s;ufficiently taught, what they are to hope for from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when the Prote&s;tants are &s;uppre&s;t (who are as much oppugned by others, as by the Papi&s;ts) to wit, that they &s;hall be &s;erved with the &s;ame &s;awce.</P>
<P N="15">15. When, after the <HI>Smalcaldick</HI> war, and the taking of <HI>John Frederick,</HI> Elector of <HI>Saxony, Wittenberg</HI> was yielded to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> petitioned
<PB N="7" REF="8"> the &s;aid <HI>Charles,</HI> to give them leave to dig up the dead body of <HI>Luther,</HI> and burn it; but the Emperor refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, <HI>Let him rest; for if he hath done ill, God will revenge it: I am Emperor of the living, and not of the dead.</HI> He further added, <HI>Let him alone, I de&s;ire to &s;ee him no more; for I &s;aw him enough at</HI> Worms. <HI>Zingrefius</HI> p. 2. Apoph. p. 11.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, pre&s;ently after the Dyet of <HI>Auxburgh,</HI> ought to have &s;urprized and oppre&s;t the Hereticks, &amp; <HI>Lu|ther</HI> by Art, under &s;ome other pretext. See <HI>Thomas Campanella,</HI> a Spani&s;h Fryar, <HI>Di&s;|cur&s;u de Monarchia Hi&s;p.</HI> c. 16.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>In the fir&s;t place it was an extream error, to let Luther go off alive, from the Dyets of</HI> Wormes <HI>and</HI> Auxburgh: And then, it was indeed well done of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth (I &s;ay) to keep his word with <HI>Luther,</HI> while&s;t he was at the Dyet; but afterwards, in his going home, he &s;hould have &s;urprized him, and after having al|ready &s;uppre&s;t the Prote&s;tant Princes, have utterly extingui&s;ht them. The &s;ame <HI>Campanella,</HI> c. 27.</P>
<P N="18">18. That Peace was to be granted for a time, and &s;ometimes the Hereticks (&s;ays <HI>Campanella</HI>) were to be flattered with
<PB N="8" REF="9"> magnificent banquets, <HI>c.</HI> 27. And be&s;ides it was an error in <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth (&s;ays the &s;ame <HI>Campanella</HI>) that he did not &s;up|pre&s;s the Countreys of the Electors of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and of the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>Ha&s;&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c. by thru&s;ting out the Inhabitants, and making them &s;laves, and planting new Colonies therein, and depriving the <HI>Free Cities</HI> of their Privi|ledges, <HI>c.</HI> 16.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Praevarications of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in order to the Pope, and his Election.</HEAD>
<P>IT may chance to &s;eem &s;trange to thee Reader, that in the <HI>Catalogue of the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Praevarications,</HI> among&s;t all the Powers and Kingdoms of the world, the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hould al&s;o come into the number, yea, and that in the &s;econd place, and as it were in the Front. But thou mu&s;t know, that &s;uch is the ambition of this Nation, and the conception of its <HI>Mo|narchy,</HI> that they cannot forbear <HI>their mo&s;t Holy Father,</HI> when there is que&s;tion of their own ends, having no re&s;pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o his Holine&s;s, nor con&s;idering at all, that he u&s;es to &s;tile them, his mo&s;t <HI>Catholick,</HI> mo&s;t <HI>Beloved,</HI> and <HI>Fir&s;t begotten &s;ons:</HI> And this is the very cau&s;e, why I thought fit to put, and &s;hew the Spani&s;h Praevari|cations again&s;t his Holine&s;s in this &s;econd place.</P>
<P>Let my kinde Reader therefore know, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> at the choo&s;ing of a new <HI>Pope,</HI> employ all their &s;tudies and la|bours,
<PB N="10" REF="10"> that either a <HI>Spaniard</HI> by birth, or a Favourer of the Spani&s;h Party, may be elected: This may be &s;hewed by many examples, and fir&s;t in the year 1591. when after the Death of <HI>Pope &V;rban</HI> the 7th. there grew a great contention among&s;t the Cardinals about a Pope; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> de&s;iring, for&s;ooth, one who was a &s;worn friend to their Party; yea, and they at length prevailed for the Election of <HI>Ni|cholas Sfondrato,</HI> a mo&s;t &s;worn Crony of theirs. <HI>Thuanus.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;ame thing hapned in the year 1592. after the death of <HI>Innocent</HI> the 9th. when the Free Election was again hindred by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Ludovico Madrucus,</HI> who was of their party; and when <HI>Antonio de Columna,</HI> King <HI>Philips</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, went into the Conclave him&s;elf, with re&s;olution, that before the &s;aid Conclave were &s;hut, <HI>An|tonio Sanctio</HI> &s;hould be nominated, and created <HI>Pope;</HI> and yet he was &s;toutly op|po&s;ed by <HI>Franci&s;co Sfortia,</HI> and <HI>Columnio Sfortia,</HI> who threatned and prepared force again&s;t force, and added, <HI>that before that &s;hould be, blood &s;hould be &s;een run out of the Conclave, down the &s;tairs to St.</HI> Peters <HI>Church.</HI> Many reproaches were thrown
<PB N="11" REF="10"> upon <HI>Sanctio;</HI> and the Cardinals being di|vided, grew into a long di&s;pute, till yet at length, by the intervention of &s;ome pecu|niary corruptions from the Spani&s;h Facti|on, <HI>Hippolito Aldobrandino</HI> was elected Pope. <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 103.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> at pre&s;ent, by their Factions, reign in the Popes Court; and however they make not what Popes they will (becau&s;e their too much greatne&s;s is much &s;u&s;pected) yet do they hinder &s;uch as they will not have by their ambitious Court&s;hips, from ri&s;ing to that dignity: and they of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> are in &s;uch a degree of favour at <HI>Rome,</HI> that it is believed by the <HI>Senate</HI> of the <HI>Holy See,</HI> that the con&s;ervation of Religion, and the dignity of the &s;aid <HI>See,</HI> depends upon them. <HI>Thuan.</HI> lib. 134. Therefore, after the death of <HI>Clement</HI> the 5th. the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> fearing lea&s;t Noble Cardinal <HI>Cae&s;ar Baronius,</HI> the writer of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Annals,</HI> &s;hould be cho&s;en Pope, revoked a complaint, which was begun again&s;t him during the life of the &s;aid <HI>Clement,</HI> by certain Letters &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by <HI>Lorenzo Suarez Figuera</HI> Duke of <HI>Feria,</HI> and <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> brought into the Congregation by <HI>Ptolemaeo Gallo</HI> Cardinal

<P>Now there was a place in the eleventh Book of his <HI>Annals,</HI> where he had writ|ten, <HI>that the Right, which the Kings of Spain claim to them&s;elves in the Monarchy of</HI> Sicilie, <HI>was grounded upon fal&s;e and &s;u&s;pected testimonies,</HI> &amp;c.

It is the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion ea&s;ily to complain of others, when them&s;elves are onely guilty; as <HI>Don Juan de Au|&s;tria</HI> did, <HI>Anno</HI> 1577. when by his Em|ba&s;&s;ador he accu&s;ed the States of <HI>Hol|land</HI> to the Emperour, the Electors, and the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> that they had
<PB N="143" REF="76"> not kept the peace, when him&s;elf had broken it before. <HI>Thuan lib.</HI> 94.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Barth. de la Ca&s;a</HI> again&s;t <HI>Sepuluenda</HI> &s;ayes, <HI>That it is not true that the Spani|ards</HI> (as they write in the <HI>Indies</HI>) con|verted every year &s;o many thou&s;and men from Gentili&s;m to Chri&s;tiani&s;m: <HI>But this</HI> (&s;ayes he) <HI>is true indeed, that the Spaniards &s;ince their coming to the In|dies, have butchered and &s;acrificed more Indians for avarice and rapacities &s;ake, then the Indians had done to their Idols in a hundred years together: And that the Spaniards did fal&s;ly accu&s;e the poor innocent and &s;imple Indians to the King, of &s;uch crimes, as whereof the most wicked in the world could not be guilty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The king of Spain promi&s;ed <HI>Sala|din,</HI> Count of <HI>I&s;enburgh,</HI> at the taking of <HI>Mounts</HI> in <HI>Hennault,</HI> that if he would be ruled by him, he would not only make him Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Colein,</HI> but that the Citie of <HI>Colein</HI> her &s;elf &s;hould &s;ettle him as her Lord. But fal&s;ly all. <HI>Fruchche&s;|&s;ius in Literis ad Colonien&s;es apud Thuan. lib.</HI> 179.</P>
<P N="4">4. A certain <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Fryar, to pre|vail with <HI>Ferdinand</HI> king of <HI>Spain</HI> for the expul&s;ion of the Jewes, &s;ecretly made a
<PB N="144" REF="77"> Table of lead, wrote what he thought good therein touching the &s;aid expul&s;ion, (with threats, &amp;c. if it were not done) hid it in a &s;acred place, and cau&s;ed it three years after to be digged up by a Comerade of his, as if it had been &s;ome divine thing, and a Prophe&s;ie; but the king ob&s;erving the fraud, neglected it. <HI>Majolus in Canicularibus</HI> 351.</P>
<P N="5">5. Howbeit envy &s;eem to be a vice of pro&s;perity onely, and proper to the rich, yet are the Spaniards &s;o much po&s;&s;e&s;t with it, that it &s;eems to be as it were hereditary to them; as <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 75. &s;ayes of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> That he was mo&s;t am|bitious in confidence of his own merits. A Detractor of the vertue of others; and (by the vice of his Countrey) contu|melious towards other Nations, and im|perious and &s;evere to &s;uch as were ju&s;t. And by and by, <HI>The envy and hatred of the Duke of</HI> Alva (&s;ayes he) <HI>made</HI> Charles <HI>the fifth deal &s;o ungratefully with</HI> Gonzaga. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIX.</HI> Other Arts and Tricks of the Spaniards to work their De&s;ignes.</HEAD>
<P>THe other wayes which the Spani|ards u&s;e for the acqui&s;ition of King|doms, are very many, but chiefly &s;ix: 1. <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ions to the people, and mercena|ry &s;ermons, e&s;pecially of the Je&s;uits.</HI> Thus was it carried in that <HI>French League,</HI> a|gain&s;t <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and in the acque&s;t of the king|dom of <HI>Portugal</HI> by the Je&s;uits. 2. <HI>Force of Armes.</HI> 3. <HI>Bribes and Corruptions.</HI> 4. <HI>Marriages and Alliances.</HI> 5. <HI>Pre&s;en|tations of the Golden Fleece to various Lords of the Spani&s;h &V;nion.</HI> 6. <HI>If they &s;u&s;pect any one, to de&s;troy him,</HI> as they did <HI>Egmund, Horn,</HI> and the <HI>Battenburghs, &amp;c.</HI> Or if that cannot be done, to &s;end him by all means out of their Territories, as they intended to do <HI>Mansfeldt,</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Orange,</HI> by making them Generals again&s;t the Turk, with large prai&s;es of their valor and prudence. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 120.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Spaniards ever have, and &s;till do, take extreamly ill the Confederation
<PB N="146" REF="78"> of the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers</HI> with the <HI>French;</HI> and therefore when <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1602. de&s;ired to renew it, <HI>Fontano</HI> Go|vernour of <HI>Milan,</HI> moved every &s;tone to hinder it, <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 129.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a very familiar thing with the Spaniards to hinder Leagues and Con|federacies, thereby to obtain their ends. Thus <HI>Pedro Guzman, Toledo, Fontano,</HI> Vice-king of <HI>Lumbardy, Anno</HI> 1605. to di&s;turb the confederation contracted between the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers,</HI> made &s;evere proclamations at <HI>Milan,</HI> wherby he inconvenienc't the commerce of both, and at an appointed place, (<HI>viz.</HI> a Rock five miles from <HI>Nova-Camo,</HI> having <HI>Clavenna</HI> and the <HI>Veltelin</HI> on each &s;ide) built a Ca&s;tle with five <HI>Forts Royal,</HI> and called it by his own name, to hinder the importation of Corn to the neighbouring parts: yea, and he &s;owed &s;o many &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en|tion among&s;t the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers,</HI> that it was like to have proved their utter ruine. <HI>Thuan.</HI> 134.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth &s;eeing <HI>Genua</HI> to be a convenient place, as well for other cau&s;es, as chiefly for the tran&s;portation of Forces out of <HI>Spain</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> and
<PB N="147" REF="78"> therefore intending to fortifie it, could never bring <HI>Dory,</HI> either by threats or promi&s;es, to give way to the building of a Ca&s;tle in it, that is, to the putting of a yoak upon his Countrey; wherefore he thought fit to take another cour&s;e to bridle the Citie, which was to borrow the <HI>Genuezes</HI> money (which is upon the matter their whole &s;upport) at what rate they plea&s;ed; conceiving that there|by he &s;hould quickly (by degrees) draw the wealth of tho&s;e greedy men to him|&s;elf, and &s;o have the Citie in his debt, that is, the affections of the Citi|zens at his di&s;po&s;al. Which trick his &s;on <HI>Philip,</HI> in imitation of his fathers example, being involved in the <HI>Low-countrey</HI> war (which was hugely ex|pen&s;ive) u&s;ed and took occa&s;ion to draw va&s;t &s;ums of money of the principall of the Nobility, for which he paid huge intere&s;t, and a&s;&s;igned the chief taxes of the Indies and Spain for the paiment thereof. <HI>Thuan. lib.</HI> 61.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Anno</HI> 1577. Some letters of Don <HI>Juan de Au&s;tria</HI> to king <HI>Philip,</HI> were intercepted, wherein among&s;t other things, they advi&s;ed him to &s;ow di&s;cord between the Gentry and Commonalty
<PB N="148" REF="79"> of the Low-Countries about Religion and liberty of con&s;cience. <HI>lib.</HI> 64.</P>
<P>It was the Maxim of <HI>E&s;covedo,</HI> and now of the Spaniards in general <HI>to breed and cheri&s;h di&s;&s;ention amongst the Princes of the world, that &s;o &s;ince they could not check them altogether, they might check them apart.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Spaniards permit no Councels or A&s;&s;emblies among&s;t their Noblemen&punc; becau&s;e they hold them very prejudiciall to their affairs, and therefore they flatly prohibited them to the Lords of the kingdom of <HI>Portugal. Thuan. lib.</HI> 78. <HI>Anno</HI> 1583.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another of the Spani&s;h practices is, to take lawfull heirs out of the Do|minions of their ance&s;tors, as they did <HI>Anno</HI> 1583. when <HI>Augu&s;ta, Philips</HI> &s;i&s;ter, under colour of vi&s;iting a Mona&s;tery of Nuns, took away <HI>Julian</HI> of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> Heire&s;s to the Principate of <HI>Avern,</HI> to the high di&s;plea&s;ure of the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> who conceived them&s;elves by this exam|ple, to be hurried into a wretched capti|vity to the <HI>Ca&s;tillians. Thuan lib.</HI> 78.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Spaniards in the Duke of <HI>Al|vas</HI> time, made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to pro|voke the <HI>Low countrey</HI> men to novelty
<PB N="149" REF="79"> and war, by dimini&s;hing and taking a|way their Priviledges and Immunities; yea, and they openly boa&s;ted, that that was the onely thing they aimed at, that &s;o they might have a fairer pretext to rifle the goods and e&s;tates of the people, and de&s;troy Cities and Provinces. <HI>Spec. Hi&s;p. Tyran. in Belgio. p.</HI> 35. Thus the afore&s;aid Duke &s;tript the Citizens of <HI>&V;trick</HI> of their priviledges, <HI>Anno</HI> 1571. And thus al&s;o did the Spaniards in this age of ours, &s;erve the <HI>Catalonians, &amp;c. Status Barcenonen&s;es, &amp; Catalauni in quer. &s;ua Cath. hinc inde, imprimis, c.</HI> 8.12.29.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Spaniards, if at any time, any Commander or Governor of theirs, commit any remarkable crime, to &s;ave them&s;elves, lay hold of &s;ome poor, inno|cent and unde&s;erving Souldier or other, and &s;acrifice him to the Hangman to &s;a|tisfie for their wickedne&s;s. One example wherof is related by <HI>Janus Duza Satyra.</HI> 40, <HI>&s;ub finem:</HI> and the like was al&s;o done heretofore in the mutiny at <HI>&V;trick,</HI> and at the firing of <HI>Duiburgh</HI> in <HI>Cleve.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Thomas Campanella, Di&s;c. de Monar, Hi&s;p. c.</HI> 14. &s;ayes, <HI>Care mu&s;t be taken that the &s;ons of &s;uch Lords and Noblemen as
<PB N="150" REF="80"> live in Kingdomes di&s;tant from</HI> Spain, <HI>and under the Spani&s;h Government, may have Spaniards to their Tutors to Hi&s;paniolize them in habit, manners, and cu&s;tomes; and when they are grown potent they mu&s;t be humbled, and under pretext of honor, be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|patcht to &s;ome Office or employment, farre from their Lord&s;hips, where they may &s;pend more then they get; and if the King chance to go on progre&s;s, he &s;hould do well to lodge at their hou&s;es, thereby to put them to ex|traordinary charges.</HI> And he further &s;aith <HI>chap.</HI> 15. <HI>That as &s;oon as the King hath conquered any Nation, he mu&s;t take away the immoveable goods of the people, allow them only food and clothing, and make them till the earth, forcing their &s;ons to be either Souldiers or Husbandmen.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Nor mu&s;t this practice of the Spa|niards be pa&s;t over in oblivion, namely, that they u&s;e to call Lords and Earles, and &s;uch as are riche&s;t, and mo&s;t in pow|er and favour with the people, in any of their Dominions, to the kings Court, un|der any pretext what&s;oever, as of bear|ing an Emba&s;&s;ie, or commanding an Ar|my, &amp;c. out of hope whereof they are not wont to appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r without great mag|nificence and &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">endor; and when they
<PB N="151" REF="80"> have made their appearance, the Spani|ards pretending &s;ometimes one thing, and &s;ometimes another, delay and de|tain them, not only one, but many years, till by expectation they have &s;pent, and wa&s;ted the greate&s;t part of their e&s;tates, and are fain to pawn them to others. And this practice they chiefly ob&s;erve in the kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI></P>

<P>A Certain Spaniard called <HI>Ferdinando Soto,</HI> coming into the I&s;le of <HI>Florida</HI> &s;aid, <HI>He was the &s;on of God;</HI> to whom one of the natives an&s;wered, <HI>If your God, who&s;e &s;on thou &s;ay&s;t thou art, commands you to invade the Dominions, Provinces, and E|&s;tates of others, and there to kill, &s;lay, &s;natch, wrest, &s;teal, &s;poyle, whore, adul|terate, &amp;c. we tell you plainly, that we cannot believe in &s;uch a God.</HI></P>
<P>Another <HI>Indian</HI> &s;peaking with <HI>Hierony|mo Benzoon,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>What kind of people are the&s;e Chri&s;tians? They take away our bread,

<P><HI>Martin Luther</HI> was wont to &s;ay, <HI>That as the Spaniards write otherwi&s;e then they read, &s;o they think otherwi&s;e then they &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;iege of <HI>Frankendal,</HI> a certain Captain fell into the hands of the Spani|ards, who bidding him yeeld him&s;elf, and they would give him quarter: he cryed out aloud, I <HI>will have no quarter of the Spaniard, but quarter in heaven;</HI> and &s;o after he had received many wounds, dyed with his &s;word in his hand.</P>
<P>The Spaniards having once petitioned <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth to remove all the drun|ken Germans from his Court, he at length convocated all the Germans, and &s;hewing them the petition of the Spaniards, pre|tended to go along with them; which the Spaniards perceiving, mo&s;t earne&s;tly be|&s;ought him to &s;tay. <HI>Idem. pag.</HI> 94.</P>

<P>I Have now &s;hewed you enough, and more then enough indeed of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and yet if any body fall &s;hort of his &s;atisfaction herewith, I remit him to the various Authors, which I have cited, and alledged in this &s;mall Book.

<PB N="158" REF="84"> is no Nation which hath given more and greater te&s;timonies and prejudices of prevarications and exorbitations both in this and in the other world, then the Spaniards; &amp; therefore have they mo&s;t de&s;ervingly incurred the hatred of all other nations.
