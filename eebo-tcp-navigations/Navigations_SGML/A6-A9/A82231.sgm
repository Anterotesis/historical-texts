<P>A Diurnall came to our hands on Mun|day <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 16. which hath a pa&s;&s;age, as we apprehend it, that hath done us un&s;uffe|rable wrong, we ble&s;&s;e God, our wayes are open to him that knows our Innocency: And to Vindicate our &s;elves, we have upon &s;erious thoughts, not to adde to the &s;ad diffe|rences of the times, VVe had rather &s;uffer quietly; but however we de&s;ire to cleare our &s;elves, to tho&s;e who are our friends, of tho&s;e &s;candalls which &s;o much tend to the prejudice of us.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Gentlemen are now aboard, who have &s;een and heard the Truth, and will no que&s;tion &s;atisfie accordingly, when they re|turne: In the meane time we &s;hall faithful|ly, as in Gods pre&s;ence certifie the Truth.</P>

<P> The Members five of them tooke Bark at a Town by <HI>Quinborrough:</HI> Gave one <HI>Green</HI> 10 <HI>li.</HI> in hand, and were to give him 10 <ABBR><HI>li.</HI></ABBR> more at their Landing at <HI>Callis,</HI> and to &s;e|cure his Barque out and in at 60 <HI>li.</HI> Upon which he having received the money, put another to &s;aile in her as Ma&s;ter; him&s;elfe went and got a VVarrant, &s;aying the Mem|bers were gone without his con&s;ent in his Barque: And with his VVarrant came to <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> &amp; there told the Inhabitants that &s;ome Parliament men were gone away with 16 Che&s;ts and Portmantles full of Trea&s;ure: upon which one <HI>Lamming,</HI> Ma&s;ter of a Dog|er-boat cau&s;ed Drums to beat, thinking to gain the money, and came after them, they taking in a Pilate here, he came by Captain <HI>Pacy,</HI> Capt. of a &s;mall frigot, and told him that &s;ome Parliament men were run away with a great deale of trea&s;ure: Upon which Captain <HI>Pacy</HI> let &s;lip his Anchors, &s;et Saile &amp; made after them, and the Doger-boat never came neer them: but Capt. <HI>Pacy</HI> &s;hooting one &s;hot, they came in to him, &amp; he brought them into the <HI>Downes:</HI> Sir <HI>Philip Stapleton</HI> very &s;ick of a flux (who &s;ince is dead of the

The Vice-admirall &s;ent Capt. <HI>Lam|ming,</HI> for Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> to &s;ee what they had to &s;hew for their leaving the Kingdome, and to &s;ee if they had any thing again&s;t them: but they not returning till a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> Clock next day, he judging they were a&s;hamed of ma|king &s;uch an untrue &s;tory, be called a Coun|cell of Warr: and there they produced their &s;everall, pa&s;&s;es, Dated two dayes before, grounded on an Order of the Hou&s;e of Commons upon their fir&s;t Impeachment; which by the Councell of Warre was per|u&s;ed: and at la&s;t it was re&s;olved to &s;end Sir <HI>George Askue,</HI> Capt <HI>Crawley,</HI> Capt <HI>Pacy,</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Penro&s;e,</HI> and divers others, to &s;earch their Ve&s;&s;ell, which was accordingly, and exactly done, to their very pockets, and there was not much found, (onely they had Bills of Exchange).</P>
<P>So the Viceadmirall and the Councell of Warre not daring, having no Order to the contrary, and &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Speakers</HI> Pa&s;&s;e &s;o lately Dated, did di&s;mi&s;&s;e them: in their lit|tle Ve&s;&s;ell to pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>About two houres after their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="4" REF="4">comes <HI>Lamming</HI> and <HI>Green,:</HI> and the Vice-admirall being at Dinner &s;ent for them in: Saw a VVarrant from the Captain of the Block-hou&s;e, Directed <HI>To all Con&s;tables, &amp;c.</HI> He asked them which they thought would mo&s;t direct him to act by? a private Cap|tains VVarrant, or an Order of both Hou|&s;es of Parliament, and Pa&s;&s;es under the <HI>Speakers</HI> hand? And that he was account|able for what he had done to both Hou|&s;es.</P>
<P>He al&s;o &s;ent Major <HI>Keme</HI> to intreat Col|lonell <HI>Twa&s;elltons</HI> Trooper to come in and drink a gla&s;&s;e of Wine, which he did: and we referre to him, if he had an uncivill word aboard.</P>
<P>Onely Major. <HI>Keme</HI> told Capt. <HI>Lamming,</HI> were he in the Army of the Councell of Warre, he would Vote him to be hanged, and he gave him this rea&s;on, that he knew he had a Commi&s;&s;ion in his pocket, &s;igned by &s;ome of tho&s;e Members to rai&s;e a Com|pany of Sea-men, to oppo&s;e the Army, and that he had received ten pounds to that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>His Commi&s;&s;ion he &s;hewed the Vice-Admirall
<PB N="11" REF="4">and as aboard in Parchment, and this was all the reviling language.</P>
<P>Then for Threatning; this we know, that he hath been out in a Dogerboate all the Sum|mer: And hath when he &s;hould have kept Sea, been lying a Shoare at <HI>Shoarum, Ha|&s;tings,</HI> &amp;c. Drinking drunk and hath abu|&s;ed, and had not the <HI>Viz-admirall</HI> found out his Knavery have cheated the State; upon which he &s;ent him in. VVe as divers Cap|taines and other Officers, and Chaplins that &s;tood by to the number of one hundred can te&s;tify. And God is our record it is truth: And further I can a&s;&s;ure this.</P>
<P N="1">1 That Collo <HI>Hollis</HI> was not there then as is reported, but Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> Sir <HI>Phillip Stapleton,</HI> Sir <HI>John Clotworthy,</HI> Sir <HI>Wil|liam Lewis,</HI> and Col: <HI>Long.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 That Captaine <HI>Lamming</HI> is only Pot-va|lient, preferred from &s;lavery in <HI>Argeire</HI> to be Ma&s;ter of a Doger-boatc la&s;t yeere, and he nor any with them ever fired a Musket.</P>
<P N="3">3 That the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion was not by the Viz-Admirall but by a cleare voce of a Coun|cell of War.</P>
<P N="4">4 That we neither reviled him nor threatn|ed
<PB N="6" REF="5">him for that Act, Major <HI>Keme</HI> tould him he having &s;uch a Commi&s;sion about him he might be hanged for beating up Drummer in the Country without other order.</P>

<P>THere is a Paper of the <HI>27</HI> in&s;tant, (Intituled <HI>His Maje&s;ties Declaration</HI>) made publick, it is patronized upon the King, but I a&s;&s;ure you His Maje&s;ty is much abu&s;ed in it: he hath many time to my &s;elf and others, expre&s;&s;ed, not onely his di&s;-avowing, but utter di&s;like of it; at fir&s;t it &s;omething troubled him, but is being &s;o unlike any thing of his, and &s;o contrary to his known intentions, be was con|fident it would not gain credence with any; yet &s;ince, hearing that di|vers both in City and Country, and Army, were &s;o fondly credulous as to deem it to be His Maje&s;ties, and &s;o were much offended at it, it was the Kings Command I &s;hould certifie my friends how extremely he is wronged, and truely Sir, you would doe the King but right, and di&s;|charge I conceive no more then your own duty to indevour the finding out the Author, and making him exemplary, and I am confident the King expects &s;o much Ju&s;tice therein.</P>
<P>Here is little newes in Court more then this, that the King ye&s;ter|day was a hunting in <HI>New Parke,</HI> killed a <HI>Stag</HI> and a <HI>Buck,</HI> af|terwards dined at <HI>Syon,</HI> &s;tayed three or foure houres with his Child|ren, and then returned to <HI>Hampton,</HI> where there is great re&s;ort of all &s;orts of people to him, but not &s;o many Cavaliers as is reported, it is confe&s;&s;ed, no Gentleman is debarred the liberty of ki&s;&s;ing the Kings, hand, yet no &s;tranger &s;tayes tong, we have fre&s;h and fre&s;h appear|ances, the faces which appeare in the morning, you &s;eldome &s;ee in the afternoone; at the farthe&s;t, but the next day. The Lord <HI>Conoway</HI> hath taken his leave of the Court for pre&s;ent, I have no more to ac|quaint you with; I &s;hall only again mind you, that to vindicate the King by di&s;covering and puni&s;hing the Libeller, cannot but give great &s;atisfa|ction to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
