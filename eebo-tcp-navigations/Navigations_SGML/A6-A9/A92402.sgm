<HEAD>Remarks on the Ob&s;ervations, OFFER'D <HI>By a True Engli&s;h-Man, <HI>Who is not a</HI></HI> SAILOR, <HI>tho' of Long Service in the</HI> NAVY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Title Demon&s;trates the Author to be no <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> or not to have ob&s;erved, That an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Sailor, not Saile'r, writ that Paper, Reflecting (as he terms it) on the Admiralty; but however he may have been Concerned; his Carping at filthy Springs from impure Fountains, cannot ju&s;tify the Admiralty which he makes the Fountain; for as <HI>Omne Simile Claudicat,</HI> &s;o doth his Com|pari&s;on, that pure Waters lo&s;e their Virtues by the Channels they flow thro'; except he would have the unalterable Or|ders, i&s;&s;ued from that formerly important Office, to be &s;ub|jected to the imprudent or ill Management of tho&s;e Com|mi&s;&s;ionated by it: This he may be a&s;&s;ured of, the old Fe|males of <HI>Wapping,</HI> would not have &s;uffered their Servants to commit Faults, without Reproof and Puni&s;hment; whereas this Author would have the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty to do &s;o, And how ju&s;tly the Sea-men living there, complain of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralties Dealings with them, the Author might be judge of, would he hear them, which he knows the Lords of the Admiralty will not, to the Fir&s;t's great Sorrow, and the Latters ever-la&s;ting Infamy.</P>
<P>How ignorant &s;oever we may be what King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Sea-Commanders might have been, the Office of Lord High Ad|miral of <HI>England</HI> is well known, and hath, in the Memory of Man been well Executed, in Compari&s;on of what hath been in the late War, or &s;ince the pre&s;ent Peace; and that the Mi&s;managements complained of, have proceeded from the Qualifications of the Gentlemen that Compo&s;e that Board, is but too evident; Witne&s;s the Breach of the Fundamental Con&s;titution of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, in the Di&s;obeying our mo&s;t Gracious King's Commands, &s;ignified by the Lord
<PB N="2" REF="2">Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> then Secretary of State, Ordering a Squadron of Ships to be &s;ent to meet Sir <HI>George Rooke,</HI> Re|turning from <HI>Cadiz;</HI> to enable him to intercept the <HI>Thoulon</HI>-Fleet, under pretence of a Verbal Contradictory Order. And how can any Fleet &s;ecure <HI>England,</HI> when it is under the Command of tho&s;e that did not puni&s;h Captain <HI>Norris,</HI> for not Attacking of <HI>Poine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> when at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> upon Cap|tain <HI>Scomberbacks</HI> Intelligence, &s;ince they thought fit to Re|ward the latter with Five hundred Pounds, and a Chain and Medal. It is true, that the want of the Experience of &s;uch Manife&s;t Mi&s;carriages as have happened in the Nine Years War may be happy for the Nation, but except tho&s;e that are known Guilty of them be puni&s;hed for Exam|ple; others, 'tis po&s;&s;ible will unadvi&s;edly fall into the &s;ame Errors.</P>
<P>It is not de&s;ired, That the Length of Service &s;hould be a rea&s;on to Di&s;place any Man in Office, but &s;urely continu|ed Di&s;&s;ervice to their Country and Prince calls for de&s;erved Puni&s;hment, and then 'twould be ea&s;y to name a &s;ett of Gen|tlemen that will Faithfully &s;erve the Publick, and render the Admiralty a Renowned, not <HI>An unlucky Office,</HI> an <HI>Epethite</HI> no <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can give to it; however, it may be given to tho&s;e that Execute it, who&s;e Services mu&s;t be forgotten, &s;ince not known, and their Crimes ought to be remembred, &s;ince they are &s;o evident, and plainly proved every Day.</P>
<P>The Hard&s;hips done to the Seamen in Turning them over from one Ship to another, I dare boldly affirm hath been the occa&s;ion of our want of Men; and without a greater Re|gard be had to do them Ju&s;tice, both in Pay and Treatment, the Number of the Di&s;obliged mu&s;t Encrea&s;e; and who doth not wi&s;h Ea&s;e and Advantage to the Seamen, can be no Friend to the Government.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Let the Crui&s;ing Captains, in the time of our Grand Fleets being in the Streights be ask'd, <HI>How they were provided with Wine,</HI> and it will appear the Sailors drank Wa|ter, without ever having their due Allowance for the Wine they &s;hould have had, which can be proved; tho' I &s;uppo&s;e the Author of the Ob&s;ervations is ignorant thereof.</P>
