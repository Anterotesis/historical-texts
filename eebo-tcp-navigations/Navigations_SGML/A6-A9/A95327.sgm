<HEAD>THE TRUEST, MOST Happie, and Jovfull Newes, that ever came from <HI>IRELAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LOng have tyrannicall in&s;olencie of the Rebels in Ireland exalted over the liberties, lives, and Con|&s;ciences of the Prote&s;tants: and hath hitherto continued &s;o cruell, bloudy, and inhumane, that it &s;upifies almo&s;t amaze ment it &s;elf: and withall, hath endan|gered the hazard of the Kingdome, But although they have triumphed thus in the continuation of their barbarous in|humanity. Yet the All-&s;eeing eye of the Almighty, who&s;e impartiall Ju&s;tice will not permit nefarious deeds to &s;leep in impunity, the omnipotency (I &s;ay) of the &s;ame eye hath frowned upon the Rebellious proceedings of tho&s;e &s;avage
<PB REF="3">mi&s;creants, which cau&s;eth no onely a|lacrity in the hearts of all, but al&s;o to heaven, for &s;o ju&s;t an overthrow. Their repul&s;e was thus, as &s;hall be &s;ub&s;equent|ly declared.</P>
<P>The Citie of <HI>Dublin</HI> was &s;uppo&s;ed to have bin in great perill, being dange|rou&s;ly invironed, and begirt with the enemy both by Sea, and Land: Yea, more|over there were divers Letters &s;ent from We&s;tche&s;ter, directed to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and read; who&s;e meaning did &s;trengthen the former &s;u&s;pitiou: for they did intimate that Dublin was &s;o circumvolved with the enemy, <HI>that it was almo&s;t thought to be de&s;titute ef Re|lief:</HI> Then it was forthwith Ordered by the Hou&s;e, that pre&s;ent Aid &s;hould be immediately rai&s;ed, and &s;ent thither with great expedition, for fear if they &s;hould procra&s;tinate the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, any danger might en&s;ue,</P>
<P>Hereupon the Commi&s;&s;ion to pre&s;&s;e (both for Land and Sea-men) did i&s;&s;ue
<PB REF="3">forthwith to His Maje&s;ties Officers. But in the mean time the Prote&s;tants ga|thered a head together, and unanimou&s;|ly con&s;ulted to have a skirmi&s;h with the Rebels, and &s;o to relieve the City of Dublin.</P>
<P>The Earl of Ormond, Sir <HI>Charles Coot, and Sir Simon Harcourt</HI> mu&s;tred up their forces, and marched couragiou&s;ly again&s;t them: whereupon at their fir&s;t fir&s;t On&s;et, there was a hot fray on both &s;ides, till at length Captain <HI>Tho|mas Stanvile</HI> came with three hundred men afre&s;h, and then they &s;lew many of the Rebels, and made them recant, &s;ome fled, others hid them&s;elves: but &s;till they followed them, &s;laying a great number, rooting them from one Town to another: and &s;o they rook <HI>Mac Brian</HI> Pri&s;oner, and driving them &s;till forward, they took <HI>Con Magenis at Care,</HI> and at the Town of Clogham they took <HI>Kory Magwire</HI> all Pri&s;oners, and committed them to the Ca&s;tle in Dub|lin.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>And there was (according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Proclamation &s;et forth by the Lord Ju|&s;tices of Dublin g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ven to all ingenerall both Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h) given to tho&s;e Commanders that apprehended tho&s;e three &s;ix hundred pounds a man. So that hereby Dublin is made free at this pre|&s;ent from any enemy, to the great com|fort and con&s;olation of tho&s;e worthy Members that are now Fathers of our Country.</P>
<P>We hope likewi&s;e, that by the auxili|ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Almighty God, that when our King and Parliament &s;hall be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;end more aid thither, that we &s;hall &s;ubdue the barba|rous rage of tho&s;e Rebels with facility. In the mean time, we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to pray for the propitious &s;ucce&s;&s;e of tho&s;e, who are there already arrived: that God would &s;o animate them with valour and courage, that they may un|dantedly &s;tand for the defence of his holy Go&s;pell, and propagation of his divine Name: That they be &s;o &s;trong|ly
<PB REF="4">armed with the true faith of Chri&s;t, that withall they &s;hould become more propen&s;e, and ready to oppo&s;e all tho&s;e enemies, that &s;hall dare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r pre&s;ume to derogate the lea&s;t title therefrom. God grant that all our battles may prove as fortunate, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive as this hath, and then we doubt not but we &s;hall become tr ly victorious: That the Pro|te&s;tant Religion do not thus initiate, and be fir&s;t a&s;cribed with the Chara|cters of blood: That the pro&s;perous &s;ecuritie of the Briti&s;h Nation, be not overwhelmed with the turbulent bar|bari&s;m of tho&s;e Wolvi&s;h Rebels. That the heart of our gracious Soveraign may be con&s;olated with more active alacritie: That the heaven-guided Par|liament may be likewi&s;e comforted and not to receive &s;uch &s;trange ob&s;tacles, and dangerous ob&s;tructions to their quotidian proceedings: That la&s;tly, the honour of God may be advanced to the great &s;ecurity of the Realm.</P>
