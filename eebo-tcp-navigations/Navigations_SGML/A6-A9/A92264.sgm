<HEAD>REASONS Humbly Offer'd to the <HI>High Court of Parliament,</HI> For Su&s;pending that Part of the Act of Na|vigation (during the War with <HI>France</HI>) which obliges the Ma&s;ter, and three Fourths of the Marriners (of his Ship) to be <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BY alowing all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships (during the War) to be Man'd with Forreigners, (who &s;hall not be liable to be pre&s;&s;ed) the King will have tho&s;e of his own Subjects now imployed in Merchants Ships, wholly in his own Service; by which his Navy will be &s;upplied in time, without the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;taying for the Men that are Abroad, as heretofore, to the great Danger of the Nation.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Ships which now lie by the Walls for want of Men, will then be Imployed, and Trade with a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Convoys, have its free Cour&s;e again, to the great incouragement of the Subject, and inabling them to a chearful Payment of their Taxes.</P>
<P N="3">III. By the Trade of the Nation, the King's Cu&s;toms will be greatly in|crea&s;ed, and by con&s;equence the Burthen on the Lands le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The nece&s;&s;ity which Merchants are now under, of imploying For|reign Shpis, &s;o much to the Prejudice of the Nation, and Advantage of Strangers, will then cea&s;e; for the&s;e Forreign Ships will not now &s;erve in any con&s;iderable Voyage, for le&s;s (&s;uppo&s;e) than a Thou&s;and Pound, which Thou&s;and Pound, except about one Hundred Pound, is all carried out of the Land; whereas if our own Ships (which now lie by the Walls for want of Men) were Imployed, this Money would all remain in the Country, except &s;ome &s;mall matter which the Sea-men &s;ave out of their Wages, and it's much if it amount to Thirty or Forty Pound: Which con&s;ider|ed, whether will it not be more to the Advantage of the Nation, to Im|ploy <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships Man'd with Forreign Sea-men, then Forreign Ships, who taking the advantage of our want of Men, demand, and at this time actually have more than double the Freight which our own Ships would &s;erve us for, if they might but be &s;o Man'd.</P>
