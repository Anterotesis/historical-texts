<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce the burning down of the Town-hou&s;e in Am|&s;terdam, nothing hath been heard almo&s;t but mour|ning and lamentation, with railing again&s;t the Go|vernours; where though the lo&s;&s;e be not &s;o much as was before conceived yet it will be great, and much money will be lo&s;t. They know not now where to tru&s;t their moneys, fire hath con&s;umed much at home, and the Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="4" REF="3">play their parts abroad; yet do they wi&s;h the Eng|li&s;h did no more mi&s;chief to them then the fire; howe|ver &s;o many lo&s;&s;es one upon another makes many of our Merchants to break. Trading begins to decay, and will undoutedly cea&s;e, if there be not a &s;udden remedy; for tho&s;e that having any thing to lo&s;e will forbear to trade, and no Goods are entred, but all is &s;till, and is not po|verty and mi&s;ery the end of this? This makes the people tumultuous and outragious threatning death to their Go|vernours for their tediou&s;ne&s;s in the publick affairs, and &s;ay, they have had an opportunity and would not lay hold thereon. To adde to this dejection of their &s;pirits, reports fly about the Town, and indeed about all the Country, that the Engli&s;h are gone Northwards, with 70 &s;ail of &s;hips manned with 16000 men, &s;o that now they fear their Herring Bu&s;&s;es, and Ea&s;t India Fleet, not onely poverty, but &s;carcity two. Now they begin to &s;et all out to &s;ea they can get together for defence. Many wi&s;h for peace, and &s;ay, <HI>That it were better to yeeld to &s;omething, then to enter into a war with England, and lo&s;e all.</HI> But as many are of a contrary temper, and roar out revenge; we hope (&s;ay they) <HI>Holland &s;hall bring forth that rod that &s;hall revenge the innocent bloud of the late King Charls, and be the &s;courge in the Hand of God to puni&s;h the in&s;a|tiable covetou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Engli&s;h Common-wealth for &s;u|periority, for which we are making great preparations at Sea.</HI> And not onely their tongues, but their pens are bu|&s;ie in railing again&s;t the Engli&s;h (not onely in pro&s;e, but in ver&s;e too) calling them Devils, Wolves, Murtherers, Ba&s;tards, Dogs, and what not? Something they would be &s;een to do as well as to &s;ay; for the other day three Engli&s;h Gentlemen walking out of the Hague in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ve|ning, were &s;et upon by many of the Dutch, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> them up and down beating and reviling them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">

It is noi&s;ed abroad that we &s;hall have the Prince of Orange in play again; and that the City of Am&s;terdam is mo&s;t de&s;irous, which is worthy of ad|miration, if we con&s;ider how much that place had like to have &s;uffered by the late Prince. They write from the Dutch Fleet hither, that they had beaten the Engli&s;h, and forced many to run a &s;hore, and taken about forty &s;hips, but the&s;e we look upon as meer untruths. By rea&s;on of the burning of the Town-hou&s;e, the &s;everal Tribunals, &s;eats of Ju&s;tice and Magi&s;tracy&punc; &s;it in other places of the town for their be&s;t accomodation.</P>
<P>The States General have granted forth letters of Mart a new unto many, whereby tho&s;e to whom the &s;aid Let|ters of Mart are granted, are given free and full power, <HI>To fight with, &s;eize upon, &s;ink, burn, and de&s;troy, in what place or places &s;oever they can or &s;hall happen to meet with them, all, or any of the &s;hips, or ve&s;&s;els, whether men of war or Merchant men, and Goods of or belonging to the Com|mon-wealth of England, or any per&s;on thereof, comming from thence, or going to any place what&s;oever.</HI></P>

<P>By this you may &s;ee what thoughts both Governours and people have of peace with the Engli&s;h; I &s;hall as oft|en as I may have opportunity offered me, give you the be&s;t intelligence I can of their proceedings, and remain,</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from France.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce the retreat of the Princes forces into the Suburbs of Saint Victor and Marcelle (which they did &s;eeing them&s;elves not able to re&s;i&s;t the King till the Arch Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">es forces come) &s;ome of the King hor&s;e being come over the bridge at Saint Clow, fell upon &s;ome of the Princes forragers, and took 200 hor&s;e and &s;ervants (who were cutting Wheat for their Ma&s;ters hor&s;es) together with about as many &s;ouldiers that were for their Convoy, the Kings being two for one.</P>
<P>The Parliament have declared, that the King is a pri&s;o|ner to the Queen his mother, and the Cardinal, and that the Duke of Orleans &s;hall be the Kings Lieutenant Ge|neral, and employ the Kings power, and his own, to &s;et the King at full liberty. Since which we hear that the King intends to return to St. Denis again, that from thence he may go towards Burgundy, becau&s;e the Normans re|fu&s;ed to accept of him, if not without Mazarine and for|ces; as for the Forces they would not make difficult of as many as there be with him now, being but two thou|&s;and, but as for Mazarine they will have nothing to do with him,</P>
<P>The King &s;ent to all the Nobility of this Province, and the mo&s;t of their Commons to come together the fir&s;t day of the next moneth, and con&s;ider how the enemies of the Kingdome comes in upon them: As the Spaniards, to nothing el&s;e but to t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ir ruine, which if they do not op|po&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="4">in time, they may when it is too late repent it: whe|ther they will obey or no, I know not yet. The Nor|mans al&s;o &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, &s;ignifying, that if he hin|der their commerce with Paris, that they will ab&s;olute|ly declare for the Princes. The Prince of Conde is indi&s;|po&s;ed the&s;e five or &s;ix days pa&s;t, which yet did not hin|der him to be pre&s;ent at the A&s;&s;embly the la&s;t Saturday: He was let blood twice, Saturday and Munday.</P>
<P>We hear that the Duke of Elboeuf, taken at Chauny, is out of pri&s;on upon his parol to pay 120000 <HI>li.</HI> Ran|&s;ome for the prince of Ligne, taken pri&s;oner by the French in the la&s;t battel given at Laus. The &s;aid prince was &s;et at liberty then likewi&s;e upon his parol to pay the &s;aid Ran&s;ome, which was not paid till now:</P>
<P>Both the French and Spani&s;h Army are marching one again&s;t the other, and it is thought within two or three days they will be about Chaulny, the la&s;t place taken by the Spani&s;h Army as before. The Arch Duke hath di|rected Lorraign to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Spani&s;h Army. The Army in our &s;uburbs here are di&s;po&s;ing to march towards Lagny, Carbeille, Meulun and Meaure, to keep the liberty of the River for this City.</P>
<P>Turens Army is now near Campagne, having power to fight the Spaniards as he &s;hall think fit, and having at his departure from St. Denis, promi&s;ed to ruine that Army. The Duke of Gui&s;e arrived at Bourg near Burdeaux, be|ing &s;et at liberty upon the Letters from prince Conde to the King of Spain. We expect another A&s;&s;embly, where|by an army &s;hall be rai&s;ed in Paris for the princes, and money wherewith they &s;hall be maintained, in ca&s;e his Maje&s;ty will not be advi&s;ed by Orleance &s;o as to joyn to Paris.</P>

<P> We have received intelligence that above &s;eventy &s;hips of the Hollanders, attempted three Merchants &s;hips in Robinhoods Bay, near Scarbrough, they pur&s;ued them clo&s;e, but two of them run a&s;hore, one was burned, and then the Dutch &s;teered away Northward with all &s;peed. One of our Scouts &s;ent out to &s;ea hath returned, and &s;aith that he was informed by an Hamburger whom he met, bound for Roan, that upon the North o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> England off Whitby, he the &s;aid Hamburger met with the Dutch Fleet, who called him aboard &s;ome of them, where he re|mained four hours, their intent was to have gained intel|ligence from him of the motion of the Engli&s;h, but he could give them none for that he had not &s;een any of them: He &s;aith that that they were in all about 107 &s;ail, &s;ixteen whereof are fire-&s;hips, ten &s;mall Frigats &s;ome 8 guns, &s;ome ten a piece, above twenty of them are good firm &s;hips, about thirty or forty guns a piece, all the re&s;t are of middle &s;ize. About twenty of them coa&s;ting up and down about Southwold have taken one or two &s;hips not|with&s;tanding the guns of the town played again&s;t them&punc; Zealand provides more for them, but Corn is very dear there, it is &s;aid that Wheat is at thirteen &s;hillings the Engli&s;h Bu&s;hel, containing eight gallons, yet are they di|vided &s;ome for war, &s;ome for peace.</P>
