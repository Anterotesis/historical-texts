<P>_MY la&s;t was of the 8 of this pre&s;ent from the Downs, &s;ince which time we have at|tempted to put to &s;ea, &s;everall times, but was forc'&s;t back thither again, by extra|ordinary &s;tormes, and cro&s;&s;e winds, by which we were all in &s;ome danger of the Kings &s;hips, and the three Ca&s;tles in the Downs, to bee &s;tayed and plundered by them.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P> As for the Kings &s;hips, they &s;ent men aboard of all our three &s;hips, to demand Powder and Ammunition for them and the Ca&s;tles, and goe aboard of them, and to &s;how their Bills of Laydings, and Letters, who affirmed they had none, nor any powder or ammuni|tion, but for the u&s;e of their &s;hips; whereupon they were threatned to be carried for Holland, unle&s;&s;e they would confe&s;&s;e and deliver what was de&s;ired, never|thele&s;&s;e at the la&s;t all our Ma&s;ters were relea&s;ed, and the Kings &s;hips &s;et &s;ayle for Holland upon the 12 day to &s;peak unto the Duke of York as they pretended.</P>
<P>And upon the 17 day the Ca&s;tles &s;ent &s;everall men and boats aboard of all our &s;hips, with order to &s;earch and plunder us, but being with&s;tood they went a&s;hore, and &s;wore God damme them, they would goe a&s;hore and &s;inke every &s;hip of us, and in pur&s;uit thereof they did their be&s;t indevours, by &s;hooting 12 pieces of great Ordnance at the lea&s;t, which forced us to weigh Anchor, and fall off to the Sea: Although the wind was contrary and calme, &s;o that we lay at their mer|cy, and in great danger, if we had not been timely relieved, by a good party of the Lord Generalls Ar|my, that marched towards the &s;everall Ca&s;tles, and found them other imployment, which fell very hap|pily out for us, for by this meanes we gained time to goe out of their command without any hurt or lo&s;&s;e, onely Captain Newburts was plundered of two rich &s;words, worth five or &s;ix pound, as he affirmed, wee being thus forced to Sea, and the &s;tormes ari&s;ing con|tinuing for the &s;pace of two dayes, did put our Ships in &s;ome danger, neverthele&s;&s;e, thanks be to God, wee heat it out, and recovered this place the 20 day,

<P>THe nine &s;hips in Holland, viz.) The Reformation, the Convertine, the Antelope, the Swallow, and the re&s;t at Gorith that revolted from the Parlia|ment of England, are making addre&s;&s;es to the Duke of Yorke, to joyn with them, and &s;end them in provi|&s;ions, which they want, and are labouring for: But the Duke told them at pre&s;ent hee could not &s;atisfie their de&s;ires, becau&s;e of his want of monies, The falling off of tho&s;e &s;hips hath put the Navy much out of order, and makes other Sea-men tumultuous, and if &s;ome cour&s;e be not taken to reduce them, I feare no Commander will bee &s;afe in any &s;hip except it plea&s;e God that &s;ome way bee found out for agree|ment between the King and Parlia. I pray God &s;o to direct the Parliament to propound, and his Maje|&s;ties heart to incline to grant, that there may bee a
<PB N="4" REF="4">peace. Waymer Ca&s;tle was &s;tormed with &s;ome lo&s;&s;e, It was thought Prince Charles would have been with Langdale in the North of England by this time, but monies comming not in as expected, it cau&s;ed his &s;tay to rai&s;e monies upon u&s;e. Captaine Crowders the Reare-Admiralls &s;hip is to be rig'd before &s;he can go out, God &s;end a &s;peedy and &s;afe peace.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Enemies abroad are at great di&s;cord among&s;t them&s;elves: and there is blood &s;pilt, for they &s;ay that one Neale Mac Kenna a great man of the party of Owen Roe is &s;lain: The Popes Nuntio hath excommunicated all the &s;upreame Councel at Kil-kenny, and like|wi&s;e Pre&s;ton and his Army, and all that doth adhere unto him, and the ce&s;&s;ation with Inchequeen: The &s;upream Councell and Pre|&s;ton, and all their adherence prote&s;ts again&s;t the Popes Nuntio his excommunication,
<PB N="5" REF="4">and doth appeale to the Pope of Rome, and hath made a Declaration of all their rea&s;ons for their appeale, which Declaration and ap|peale in Print I beleeve Col. Jones hath now &s;ent into England: I a&s;&s;ure you the Enemies are exceedingly out of heart, and the gene|rality of the people de&s;ire a peace, and to be from under this Iri&s;h rebellious government for all &s;orts of people &s;uffer extreamly in their e&s;tates: and hardly can &s;upport their fami|lies: the Taxes and Levies being &s;o exceed|ing great: So that none gets by this warre, but the Popi&s;h Clergy, and the ra&s;call rout, and men of broken fortunes, which lives by all robberies and &s;tealths: There is a report here that the Marque&s;&s;e Ormond is landed in Mun&s;ter; this news comes out of the Iri&s;h quarters, but I doe hardly credit it to be true, Inchequins revolt hath for the pre&s;ent much &s;upported the Iri&s;h, and prejudiced the Pro|te&s;tant party in this kingdome: but I hope it will little availe them in the end: for if it plea&s;e God to protect England from a new warre, and that the Parliament &s;end over &s;peedily in time; &s;ufficient recruts of men,
<PB N="6" REF="5">to go abroad into the field next Moneth. I doubt not by Gods help this Summer will fini&s;h the warre in this kingdome, Col. Jones and Col. Monks, agree and &s;ement clo&s;e to|gether: and will hold firm and &s;ure to the Parliament: they intend to joyne together as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly they may, to take the field Col. Moncks was here, and departed home ye|&s;terday.</P>
<P>My Brothers Troop had a great lo&s;&s;e la&s;t week in the County of Wicklow, for the ene|my came &s;uddenly over the place where their hor&s;es grazed, and took-away &s;ixteen of the Hor&s;e, with one Graham, and Adam Loftus, that then kept the Hor&s;es at Gra&s;&s;e: I hope we &s;hall get the two men to bee exchanged and brought home.</P>
