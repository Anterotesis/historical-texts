<HEAD>Another bloudy Fight at Sea between the Engli&s;h, French, and Dutch, upon the Coa&s;t of Cornwal, on Sunday the 13^t^h of this in&s;tant June, 1652. With the particulars of the Fight, the manner of the Engagement, and great execution done on both &s;ides.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ON the Twelfth of this in&s;tant June, 1652. there hapned another great and bloudy Fight within three Leagues of this place, between the Parliaments &s;hips, under the immediate conduct and command of Sir George Ay&s;cue; and the French and Dutch Fleet comman|ded by Vice-Admiral Cha&s;tillon: the manner thus: Sir George Ay&s;cue having received adverti&s;ements of about 30 Sayl of &s;hips, that were coa&s;ting the
<PB N="4" REF="3">We&s;tern channel, re&s;olved forthwith to weigh an|chor and make after them: in order whereunto, he ho&s;ted &s;ayl from Plymouth Bay on the eleventh in|&s;tant and, having a fair gale of wind, about &s;ix of the clock the next day in the afternoon, made a di&s;|covery of a great Fleet neer Pendennis Peer: where|upon he &s;ent forth the Eagle Frigat, to demand what they were, and from whence bound; who an&s;wer'd, That they were to give an account to none, but the Lord Admiral Vantrump, from whom they had re|ceived both their Commi&s;&s;ion, Power, and In&s;tru|ctions: Then they were commanded to &s;trike &s;ail; but peremptorily refu&s;ed to yield obedience there|unto, &s;aying, That they were re&s;olved rather to die, then be guilty of violating the lea&s;t point of honor: Whereupon Sir George gave them a &s;alute with one broad &s;ide; which was an&s;wer'd: Then he fitted his &s;hip for the &s;econd broad &s;ide, and fired on him, but was again an&s;wer'd by the Admiral, who bore up his Helm, and &s;tood before the wind: whereupon ano|ther of the Parliaments &s;hips coming up to him, pre|&s;ented him with two broad &s;ides, &amp; laid him aboard the &s;tar-board; which the enemy perceiving, blew up the Upper-Decks; &s;o that the Engli&s;h were en|forced to de&s;ert her, with &s;ome lo&s;s: But upon Sir Georges tacking about the third time, he pre&s;ented
<PB N="5" REF="3">them with a Volley of three&s;core Guns, which did great execution, both above Decks, and between wind and water; for &s;oon after &s;he &s;unk, and about one hundred men were drowned.</P>
<P>The &s;ight whereof cau&s;ed great a&s;toni&s;hment to the French and Dutch; who, by rea&s;on of the neer approach of the night, declined engagement; till the next morning about five of the clock, where an exceeding &s;harp di&s;pute happened, and continued for the &s;pace of &s;even hours, which was performed with great gallantry on both &s;ides; till at la&s;t, after many hundreds of &s;hot, it plea&s;ed the Divine Power of Heaven to crown the Engli&s;h with Victory, and to vanqui&s;h their Enemies: for, of the&s;e thirty &s;ayl, not &s;even got off from being exceedingly rent and torn; five were taken, and three &s;unk; but not with|out &s;ome lo&s;s: there being five (at pre&s;ent) mi&s;|&s;ing. The Enemy was at lea&s;t three to one; yet &s;o gallant a Re&s;olution do the Engli&s;h retain, that they dare attempt to fight upon any di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>We hear that Captain Brad&s;haw (the great Py|rat) doth much annoy the Engli&s;h upon the Iri&s;h Seas, and that he hath lately taken four or five Ve&s;|&s;els, and cha&s;ed &s;ome others into Port-Patrick. Ma|ny other Pyrates there are, who do exceedingly in|fe&s;t tho&s;e parts.</P>

<P>From the Downs we have received in|telligence, That the Hollander is very bu&s;ie upon the North Seas, in catching of Her|rings; and Van-Trump hath &s;ent a great Fleet to them to &s;ecure and convoy them: Whereupon, General Blake having notice thereof, immediatly gave in&s;tructions to Major Bourn, to ha&s;ten after with fifty &s;ail, &s;o that if they meet, a great engagement is expected.</P>
<P>Great are the preparation of both States for the defence of both Nations, notwith|&s;tanding the pre&s;ent Treaty between the Parliament and the Lord Emba&s;&s;adors; &amp; divers &s;hips (by expre&s;s command from the Councel) are ordered to expedite out of the River to the Downs, and tho&s;e that want provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries, are &s;ud|denly to be &s;upplied from other &s;hipping. Yet notwith&s;tanding, a happy Reconcilia|tion is much de&s;ired, and a firm peace and u|nion
<PB N="7" REF="4">&s;etled: For effecting whereof, the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds are prof|fered to the Parliament of England by the States of Holland, in reference to their Li|berties, Freedom, and Fi&s;hing. But 'tis gi|ven out, that the Parliament demands for future &s;ecurity, the rendition of Brill, flu&s;h|ing, and certain other Gari&s;on Towns, for the placing in of Engli&s;h Gari&s;ons, and pre|venting of future differences.</P>
<P>We hear that upon &s;ome further action between the Engli&s;h and the Hollander, that Captain Taylors &s;hip is &s;unk, together with the great James; the truth whereof, I dare not affirm, conjecturing it to be onely a Rumor: Many of the Dutch-men are ex|ceedingly inclining to peace and unity; but on the contrary part, others there are, who thir&s;t after bloud: but whether &s;uch as may or &s;hall foment this divi&s;ion, do not act the policy of the Wolf in the fable, that per&s;wa|ded
<PB N="8" REF="5">the &s;heep to give over their Ma&s;tives? Or, if Venice may not unproperly be cal|led the &s;ignet on Neptunes right hand: and whether England and the Netherlands be|ing in a &s;traight Confederacy, may not be &s;tiled his two arms. Again, whether your Maiden-Towns, as you call them, may not long enjoy that Title under the allyance of England, who hath many as rich and beau|tiful Harbors, as of France, that cannot ju&s;t|ly brag of the like plenty, or conveniency for &s;cituation? But for this, as all good things el&s;e, let glory, honour, and prai&s;e be given to God.</P>
<P>The Report concerning the James being &s;unk, is fabulous: And the Tyger (commanded by Captain Peacock) being for &s;ome time mi&s;|&s;ing, is with &s;afety come up to the Fleet; and hath brought in three Dutch Prizes.</P>
