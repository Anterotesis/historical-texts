<HEAD>THE KINGS MAIESTIES RESOLUTION <HI>Concerning the Earle of WARWICK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe differences be|twixt His Royall Maje&s;tie and the high Court of <HI>Parliament,</HI> are apparently <HI>known</HI> and made manife&s;t; in&s;omuch, that the Subject is &s;o vehemently di&s;tracted, that the differences betwixt the Head and the Body, are not, nor will not be &s;uddainly brought to an end, or full period; His Maje&s;tie &s;tandeth for his Prerogative, and the Parliament for their priviledges, two great matters now in di&s;&s;ent between
<PB REF="3">His Maje&s;ty and the Parliament, bu&s;ine&s;|&s;es of no little Con&s;equence: yet this is not all the Controver&s;ie which is betwixt the King and Parliament, but the Lawes and Liberties of the Subject is in great di&s;&s;ent betwixt His Royall Maje&s;ty and the Honourable Court of Parliament, and the &s;ubject is in a great perplexity, by rea|&s;on of the differences now in contention, not knowing how to obey the Preroga|tive nor priviledges, the prerogative &s;tan|ding for the Honour and Dignity of His Royall per&s;on, the priviledge for the Li|berty and Freedom of the Subject.</P>
<P>But the placing of Officers by the Ho|nourable Court of <HI>Parliament,</HI> without the con&s;ent of His Maje&s;ty, hath been the Cau&s;e of many Di&s;tempers ari&s;ing from his Maje&s;ties Royall Brea&s;t, all which be|ing for the good and &s;afety of the whole Kingdome, by rea&s;on of the great danger this Kingdom were in, and the great haz|zard of ruine that were like to befall this Nation, had not they out of their judici|ous care took into con&s;ideration the dan|ger
<PB REF="3">that were like to in&s;ue, happy are we to e&s;cape &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty taking into con&s;ideration, the Government of his Navie Royall, his will and plea&s;ure was, That Sir <HI>John Pen|nington</HI> &s;hould have the place of Admiral &s;hip re&s;igned unto him, being again&s;t his Maje&s;ties will and plea&s;ure, that the Earl of <HI>Warwicke</HI> &s;hould enjoy that place any longer, and to that end and purpo&s;e did &s;end a Me&s;&s;age to the Earl of <HI>Warwicke</HI> to give up his place, and that he &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ld o|bey his &s;peciall Command, which was, that he &s;hould re&s;ign his place to S. <HI>John Pennington,</HI> the &s;aid Sir <HI>John</HI> being neer unto him, expecting the Receit therof.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty were likewi&s;e Re&s;olved, that he &s;hould not enjoy that place any longer, but that He &s;hould obey his Com|mand therin.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Warwicke</HI> having received this Me&s;&s;age and Command from his Ma|je&s;ty, wherin was &s;pecified his full Re&s;o|lution and intention, being much per|plexed, thinking and conceiving it a
<PB REF="4">matter of no &s;mall con&s;equence, which he was entru&s;ted with, being for the de|fence of HIs Maje&s;ties Royall Per&s;on, and the &s;afeguard of the whole Kingdom, knowing the integrity of his own heart both to His Maje&s;tie and the Parliament, he re&s;olved not to de&s;ert that charge committed to his tru&s;t, wherein God &s;ince his beginning hath pro&s;pered him with &s;uch happy and fortunate &s;ucce&s;&s;e; and therefore he &s;et down his full Re&s;o|lution, that he would not re&s;igne that place, but to continue it; untill he &s;hould be revoked by that Authoritie which hath entru&s;ted him with it.</P>
<P>Which Re&s;olution he declared like|wi&s;e to all His Maje&s;ties Captains, at a meeting which he had appointed for that purpo&s;e; and at the &s;ame time, they unanimou&s;ly and cheerfully took the &s;ame Re&s;olution; taking many &s;olemn Vowes and Prote&s;tations, to continue the &s;ame as long as breath remained in their bodies, and that they would for the per|formance thereof, &s;eale it with their
<PB REF="4">deare&s;t blood; being a token and wit|ne&s;&s;e of their fervent love and affection, which they beare both to their King and Country, vowing to maintain the &s;ame to the utmo&s;t of their power.</P>
<P>And that His Per&s;on which the Ho|nourable Hou&s;e of Peeres and Commons, had &s;et over them to be their Governour, meaning the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>WARWICK,</HI> &s;hould never take the lea&s;t blemi&s;h, &s;o long as they were able to performe any &s;ervice to his Lord&s;hip, the Re&s;olution of them being &s;o con&s;tant and true, that &s;uch men of &s;pirits were never known, which we mu&s;t all attribute to the great God of Heaven and Earth only. So I be&s;eech the Lord of Heaven to con|tinue them in the &s;ame Minds and Re|&s;olutions, which they have mo&s;t faithful|ly and unanimou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed to the va&s;t world, in generall,</P>

<P>Thus may we all &s;ee, the miraculous Actions and Proceedings which the Lord entru&s;teth with his &s;ervants.</P>
