<P>_ON Wedne&s;day la&s;t, being the 20 in&s;tant, the Engli&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners for Admini|&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, &s;ate upon Criminal matters at Edenborough: The fir&s;t day was &s;pent in reading their Commi&s;&s;ion from the
<PB N="4" REF="3">Commi&s;&s;ioners at Dalkeith, calling the Sheriffes of the &s;e|veral counties on this &s;ide of the Frith, and tho&s;e that ap|peared not were fined 200 l. Scotch each. Afterwards the Gentlemen of the &s;everal counties, who were to do their &s;ervice, were called, and &s;uch as appeared not fined 100 li. Scotch; and then &s;everal Delinquents were called, and &s;uch &s;et down for Tryal, and fining of &s;everal per&s;ons for A|dultery, Ince&s;t, and Fornication, for which there were a|bove 60 per&s;ons brought before the Judges in a day. And it is ob&s;ervable, That (&s;uch is the malice of the&s;e people) that mo&s;t of them were accu&s;ed for facts done divers years &s;ince, and the chief proof again&s;t them was their own con|fe&s;&s;ion before the Kirk. One Ephraim Bennet (a Gunner in Lieth) was indicted, convicted, and condemned for co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ning of money; al&s;o two Engli&s;h men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ondemned for killing one Scotch-man in March la&s;t.

The Jud|ges are re&s;olved to have an accompt of the ground of this cruelty. It is very probable there will &s;hortly be more di&s;|coveries of this kind of Amboyna u&s;age; On Wedne&s;day la&s;t the Marq. of Argyle came to Edenbourgh; and &s;oon
<PB N="5" REF="3">after came the joyful tydings of the relea&s;e of all our pri|&s;oners.

<P>SOme of the Dutch Free-boters (with whom this coa&s;t is very much pe&s;tered) have &s;urpri|&s;ed four &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els (between Barwick and the Holy-I&s;land) that were coming from Scotland: And meeting with a &s;mall Bark belonging to Scar|borough homeward bound, cha&s;ed her a whole fore-noon, and at la&s;t forced her to run a&s;hore near Flamborough head, where the Countrey people coming to her re&s;cue, the Skellums were forced to leave her.

<HEAD>The Copy of a Letter from Plimouth, concerning the Engagement of the En|gli&s;h and Dutch Fleets between the I&s;le of VVight and Portland.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONe of our Frigots (&s;couting out) met with two Flemi&s;h men of warre, with whom &s;he maintained a very de&s;perate fight for the &s;pace of two hours, in which time &s;he &s;o &s;hatter'd their tac|kle that the Butterboxes declined Engagement, and night approaching our men could not follow the pur&s;uit, but in their return to the Fleet, they took a Dutchman laden with Wine and &s;trongwater, and a Frenchman laden with &s;alt. It was reported here by the Owner of a Hive which came from Fal|mouth, that on Thur&s;day the eight and twenty of October, about thirty of the Parliaments &s;hips be|longing
<PB N="8" REF="5">to General Blake, were engaged with the Dutch Fleet, and that there had been a very fierce and bloudy Fight between them near to the I&s;le of Wight, but what was the Event or &s;ucce&s;s thereof he could not re&s;olve, they being &s;aid to be engaged at his coming from thence; therefore I &s;hall wave the further relation hereof till further confirmation; Onely this I can a&s;&s;ure you (for I have it from very good hands) that on the fourteenth in&s;tant, there was a very con&s;iderable Fleet of Hollanders de&s;cri|ed to pa&s;s by Falmouth, which (as they &s;uppo&s;ed) was bound for the Straits; and that one of our men of War lighted on one of their &s;traglers (a very rich &s;hip) and brought her into Falmouth. Thus de&s;i|ring you to take this in good part, and excu&s;e me for being no larger; for though I am willing to &s;erve you with intelligence, yet I would not be ac|counted a broacher of fal&s;ities, or publi&s;her of un|truths.
