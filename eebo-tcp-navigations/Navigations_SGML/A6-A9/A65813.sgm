<HEAD>A TRUE COPY OF A LETTER From an Engli&s;h Gentleman in the Emperour's Army, to an Engli&s;h Officer in <HI>Holland,</HI> concerning the Total Rout of the Turks, by the United Forces of the Chri&s;tians, Com|manded in per&s;on, by the Emperour, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Lorain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Cannot expre&s;s my &s;elf in words &s;uitable to the great deli|verance it hath plea&s;ed God to give the Nation, and Empire of the Germans, from the Cruelties and Barba|rieties it groaned under, by the Savage Violences of Turk|i&s;h In&s;idels, in Conjunction with a wor&s;e &s;ort of Menthan them|&s;elves, who outwardly pretend a Belief of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> when at the &s;ame time, their Power, Indu&s;try, and Council tends to no le&s;s than the Total Extirpation of Chri&s;tianity, and the &s;etting up its common Enemy Mahumeti&s;m; under the &s;ame Notion of the old Rebels in <HI>England(Viz.)</HI> (for the True <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion.</HI>) There being in the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Na|tion two Sects of Prote&s;tants, <HI>Viz. Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> the latter of which, claiming the &s;aid <HI>Epithet</HI> under the Banner of the Horrid Impo&s;ture and great Idol of the Ea&s;t <HI>(Mahomet)</HI> I could do no le&s;s than make this little &s;hort Reflection, becau&s;e it to me &s;eems a Remark of &s;o near a Parrallel with &s;ome practices in my own Country, the Re&s;pect I bear to it, would not &s;uffer me to be &s;ilent in the laid particulars.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland,</HI> with a Royal Army attending him, arrived at our Camp, the Emperour having cau&s;ed all nece&s;&s;a|ry Provi&s;ions, to be made for his Royal Maje&s;ties Reception, before which, &s;everal con&s;iderable Reinforcements, were ar|rived, being part of the <HI>Auxiliary</HI> Troops of the Empire, of which great Numbers are on their March from all the Remo|te&s;t parts of the Empire: immediately after his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Po|land</HI> was arrived a great Council of War was held in the Em|perours Tent; which being ended, prayers were publickly of|fered throughout the Camp, for a Succe&s;s upon the Endea|vours of the United Arms, of the Chri&s;tians again&s;t the
<PB N="2" REF="2">Turks and Infidels, which being ended, immediately the whole Army, by Order, was on its March towards the Enemy; who lay in Seige before <HI>Vienna</HI> according to common Compu|tation 150000 &s;trong at lea&s;t: the Army marched in three Batalias, the Body Commanded by the Emperour in per&s;on; the right wing by his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the left by his High|ne&s;s of <HI>Lorain,</HI> in which po&s;ture we marched with all im|maginable Silence towards <HI>Vienna:</HI> The City having at we fame time notice that we were approaching, and as &s;oon as we came to di&s;cern the Enemies Leagure, the City gave us a Signal, which in half an hours time was &s;econded with a Re&s;olute &s;ally; in which many Thou&s;|ands of the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;lain, with very &s;mall lo&s;s on the Chri&s;tians &s;ide. The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeming to be in great Con&s;ter|nation upon the &s;ight of the unexpected numbers of the Chri&s;tian Army, before the &s;aid Salley was ended, part of Our Army under his Highne&s;s of <HI>Loraine</HI> were engaged and &s;oon after the Gro&s;&s;e of both Armies, the di&s;pute being for &s;everall hours very &s;harp and hot; but in the end it &s;o plea&s;ed God, that our Arms prevailed again&s;t the Infidels we having kill'd above thirty Thou&s;and upon the &s;pot, and taken near half as many Pri&s;oners and all their Ar|tillery and Baggage which vvere very great and numerous and Totally broke the vvhole Army of the Turks, vvhich our Hor&s;e continue to pur&s;ue vvith great &s;laughter, and all this was done by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty with incon&s;iderable lo&s;s on the Chri&s;tians &s;ide, and it is the opinion of mo&s;t of our Experienced Commanders here in Camp, that very few of the Turks will E&s;cape of being taken or killed. The Enemy being fled divers of our Offi|cers went into the City and great numbers of the Citi|zens came to veiw our Camp, their countenances be&s;peak|ing they had been neither in fear of the Enemy nor any want of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions. We are now bu&s;ied in de|&s;troying the Enemys works about the City; and in my next I may give you a more particular Account of the whole Affair: in the mean time be plea&s;ed to accept of this, as</P>
