<HEAD>The Reer-Admirals Letter to an Eminent Merchant in <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LEa&s;t my &s;ilence altogether may breed &s;u&s;pition of neglect to my friends, although you may well gue&s;&s;e I have little time yet to write, being &s;carce recrui|ted with any re&s;t, and having many things in head and hand at this &s;ea&s;on; yet I &s;hall briefly offer thus much by way of advice, to the end you may with us acknowledge, that we have great incouragement to believe, that the pledge of Gods favour to us, is a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony among&s;t many more, that he is among&s;t us, and will appear in glory. The 18 of this In&s;tant about ten a clock in the forenoon, <HI>Van Trumpe</HI> with 40 &s;ail of Ships of War more, appeared very near the back of the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> the weather being hai&s;ie, we could not &s;ee him before. At which time of his appearance, my &s;elf being commanded thereunto, was left in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and wore a Flag at the Maintopma&s;t head, and with me &s;even &s;hips were left, the re&s;t of the Fleet being with the General to the We&s;tward, they con&s;i&s;ting of 12. &s;ail, when I &s;aw them luf|fing round in with the South&s;ands head, the tide of Floud being ju&s;t then come; I concluded he was re&s;olved for the <HI>Downs,</HI> and intended to have dealt with us, he knowing by in|telligence that our Fleet was divided. I pre&s;ently got loo&s;e, and tho&s;e with me, and were in readine&s;s for them with that &s;mall &s;trength we had. But within two hours after he had lain muzled between the Sand-head and the Forland, two Frigots appointed by the General <HI>Trump,</HI> came towards us, which were met by one &s;mall Frigot, I &s;ent out for that purpo&s;e to under&s;tand their Re&s;olution; who an&s;wered, that they had a me&s;&s;age to deliver to the Commander in the <HI>Downs,</HI> &s;o they came into the Road, and the Captains of them both came a|board
<PB N="4" REF="3">me, who in the name of their Admirall &s;aluted me, and gave me this account of his approach &s;o near: Namely, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end them to give this intimation of a&s;&s;urance, that he came with no intent to offer any injurie to the Engli&s;h Nation, and withall de&s;ired there might not be apprehen&s;ion of any &s;uch thing, for he was forced there|unto being put to Leeward with his Fleet by the Northerly winds that had blown hard, and that the day before he rode off <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> where divers of his Fleet had lo&s;t their An|chors, and &s;o forced to Leeward. This complement I received with great allowance on my part, in point of Credence; look|ing at this but a juggle, and could not otherwi&s;e expound this, but a high affront to this State, and a great provocati|on to us, and by his Me&s;&s;enger returned this An&s;wer, that in part I believed their coming &s;o nigh was occa&s;ioned by the winds. But I know well it was in their power whether that day they would have come &s;o nigh us, and &s;o returned a com|plement to their Admiral, and de&s;ired, if he were reall in what he pretended, he would remove his quarters, el&s;e we &s;hould interpret it otherwi&s;e, and gave him to under&s;tand that our Admirall was plying up towards this place being Crucing a|broad. Among other di&s;cour&s;e they told me their Admi|rall would have come into the Road, but was not willing to &s;trike his Flag: To which I returned him an&s;wer, that we &s;hould expect nothing more nor le&s;&s;e, but what they know to be the ancient right of this Nation, and that would be ex|pected not onely here, but el&s;ewhere in the&s;e Seas where|ever we met him. And whatever our &s;trength was in their outward Ob&s;ervation, we had the &s;trong God on our &s;ide, who would judge between the Nations, and whether they intend|ed War or Peace, it did not &s;ignifie much to me, but wi&s;hed the hand of God might be upon that man, who &s;hould be fir&s;t cau&s;e or ground of the breach between us. For our parts they might &s;ee &s;en&s;ibly that we had no &s;uch intentions, unle&s;s for|ced thereunto. So they returned with this me&s;&s;age, and that evening the whole Fleet anchored off the <HI>S.</HI> Foreland in the fair way. Of all this I gave account to the Councel of State, and al&s;o di&s;patched away a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el with the like to the
<PB N="5" REF="3">General <HI>Blake,</HI> which came to his hand that night, and in the morning I received return from him, being between the <HI>Ne&s;se</HI> and the <HI>Foul&s;tone.</HI> All that night I kept a guard by two Fri|gots that lay at a di&s;tance from me, and one from another, betwixt us and them, to give &s;ight of their motion, but they moved not that night. About noon the nineteenth day, wee &s;et &s;ail with my Squadron towards <HI>Dover,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing by that time I had the length of the Foreland, I &s;hould &s;ee our Gene|rall, who that Floud would be with us: And immediately the <HI>Hollands</HI> Fleet weighed anchor, and all &s;tood off towards the coa&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> I bore away to the We&s;tward, and within an hour &s;aw our Fleet at three Leagus di&s;tance almo&s;t, they plying we came neere them apace; all this while <HI>Trump</HI> &s;tands over, and as I &s;uppo&s;e, was fitting his Ships, and con|&s;ulting, what to doe, for by this time he &s;aw our General: In|deed I thought &s;urely he would have plyed homewards to a|void &s;triking. But very &s;uddenly after he bore up, and all his Fleet, fourty one in all, and made all &s;ail, him&s;elf in the Van &s;teering right our General, and &s;o &s;ea&s;onably did God or|der things according to our thoughts, that were ju&s;t, and were in conjunction with both our Squadrons by the time that hee was come to our Admiral: He mo&s;t in&s;olently bore right to him with his Flag abroad, at which the General &s;hot once, a &s;econd time, and a third; Upon which <HI>Trump</HI> fired his broad &s;ide, or the greate&s;t part at him, and withall put abroad a bloudie Flag under his other, upon which every of us addre&s;|&s;ed to the Ingagement, according to that God called us unto: Their Ships generally firing upon us fir&s;t, and indeed the rea|&s;on of that in part was, becau&s;e we would get neerer them, that &s;o our Ordnance might doe the better execution on them, and withall we look at it as our advantage in point of Inno|cencie, that they &s;truck us fir&s;t.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoone wee began, and continued fighting till it was darke. <HI>Trump</HI> &s;teered a way right afore it, the wind being Ea&s;terly, his Fleet followed accordingly, we being on his right wing, &s;ome of us endeavouring to break his body, divided them into two or three parts, wherein they &s;huf|fled them&s;elves into clu&s;ters, but by rea&s;on many of our Ships
<PB N="6" REF="4">and Friggots &s;ailed very heavie by rea&s;on they are foule, we could not &s;o fully attaine our de&s;ire upon them, yet by the help of God gave them &s;o much, that they had no mind to engage any further then we could force it: for they made all &s;ayle they could, mo&s;t of them, and as wee coveted to be near them they declined, and I doe verily beleive they were heart-&s;trucken notwith&s;tanding their in&s;olent Bravado. This gave us a clear call, and added a great deal of re&s;olution to us, that they &s;ought us, and came to us to make the quarrel, when as they might have avoided it do what we could. Our men very unani|mous in the Work: And I am very confident upon very &s;afe grounds of Faith, that they &s;hould be as driven &s;tubble be|fore the whirlewind of the Lord. I &s;hall not add more, I ble&s;&s;e God I fear before him, He is our &s;trength and our confi|dence. But &s;urely they quitted them&s;elves very di&s;honora|bly: forasmuch as they &s;uffered us to take one of their Fleet, of thirty Guns, and as I pre&s;ume by all circum&s;tances we &s;unk another of the &s;ame force: both which fought very &s;toutly, yet none of their Fleet would &s;uccor them, &s;o great was their ha&s;te, and I do verily think, that if we had had one hour or two more before it was dark, you would have received a bet|ter account of many of the re&s;t. As for that Ship that was taken, &s;he is with us, and her men which are about ninety or one hunured, are devided aboard our Ships, the Captaine of her is a <HI>Flu&s;hinger,</HI> who was aboard off me at <HI>Calis,</HI> when I was abroad with a &s;quadron, about three weeks agoe, and he cries out agai&s;t <HI>Trump,</HI> and the re&s;t, for their cowardly carriage in leaving them to our mercy, having &s;o great a Fleet with him, we being but halfe his number, and withall avowes he had no knowledge of any intention to fight with us. As for the o|ther Ship, I pre&s;ume &s;he &s;unk in the night, fora&s;much as when our &s;hips left her, &s;he had &s;ix foot water in hold, and her main|ma&s;t &s;hot over-board, and our men dur&s;t not keep in her, the Captaine of her for&s;ooke her, and came aboard in the Boate we &s;ent aboard, but what is become of the men we know not, it being in the night, and our Fleet &s;cattered were con&s;train|ed to gather about our General, to the end we might con&s;ult what to doe, we having been &s;urprized before we could &s;peak
<PB N="7" REF="4">a word together, or receive any thing of command from him. What other &s;poile we did them we know not, what they have done to us is not very con&s;iderable, unle&s;&s;e the bloud of our men, which will be called for in due &s;ea&s;on. The Ge|nerall had &s;ix men killed, be&s;ides divers wounded, &s;ome others lo&s;t four, &s;ome two, and one, and &s;ome none killed, but few hurt. Our Rigging, Ma&s;ts, and Sayles &s;hot, mo&s;t of us, and many &s;hot in our Hulls, notwith&s;tanding we have lo&s;t &s;o few men. All I &s;hall &s;ay is, this is the fir&s;t of Gods appearing for us by Sea, and though the fight was running, and not &s;o hot as otherwi&s;e it would, if they had not declined it, yet we look at God in his providence, giving us great boldne&s;&s;e to believe that the Warre was his, and that if they go on to make warre, it is that they may be broken, although we are very unworthy of any &s;uch favour, and very weak and incon&s;iderable in &s;trength.</P>
<P>The 20. being ye&s;terday, we &s;aw them in the morning as farre as we could de&s;cry them, plying over as I &s;uppo&s;e for <HI>Deip</HI> Roads, or the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> that night it was re&s;olved at a Coun|cel of Warre to ply into <HI>Dover</HI> Road, or the Downs, there to recruit &s;ome things we want, and al&s;o to receive a po&s;itive Order from our State in order to our proceedings. The Lord of Light be their Coun&s;ellor, and then fear nothing. I have been more tedious in this narrative, (not that I love long di&s;|cour&s;e, neither am very fit at pre&s;ent to write) but to &s;atisfy you and all friends who are with us in heart, and are deeply concerned in this beginning. The Lord help you to remem|ber us, and keep us faithfull unto him, and his Intere&s;t, and honour us much more in doing him &s;ervice if he have any plea&s;ure in us, which is the greate&s;t ambition I have in this World, and &s;o I crave leave to remaine,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very affectionate and faithfull Servant, <HI>N. BOURNE.</HI></SIGNED>
