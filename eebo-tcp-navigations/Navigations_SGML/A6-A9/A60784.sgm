<HEAD>SOME CONSIDERATIONS Relating to the Trade to Guiny.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Royal Company,</HI> as they call them&s;elves, are a great In|jury to the Nation in divers Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">I. They hinder the vent of the Woollen Manufacture, trading them&s;elves incon&s;iderably, nor &s;uffering others, whereby not a Tenth part of the Product of <HI>England</HI> is Exported for <HI>Guiny,</HI> as might be, if the Trade were open, or managed by a Regulated Company.</P>
<P N="2">II. They occa&s;ion the Decay of Navigation; Ten times the Number of Seamen and Ships might be imployed in that Trade, were it open, or regulated as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P N="3">III. They Advance the Intere&s;t and Trade of other Nations; for whil&s;t we forbear to &s;upply that Coa&s;t with Goods, other Nations fill it, and beat us out of our Trade with their Manufactures, when our own would at the &s;ame time vend better among&s;t the Natives, if we would &s;upply the Mar|ket.</P>
<P N="4">IV. They are dangerous for the re&s;t of their Maje&s;ties Subjects to deal with; for when a Company has a mind (after they have made ma|ny Dividends) they may break, th&ocirc; every Individual Per&s;on be very rich, there is no Remedy for the Creditors.</P>
<P N="5">V. They &s;et what Price they plea&s;e upon the Manufacture of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o lower the Price of Wool, ruin the Workers and Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture, becau&s;e there is but one Buyer.</P>
<P N="6">VI. They &s;et what Price they plea&s;e on Ships they hire, for they have none of their own, and &s;o Di&s;courage the Building of Ships, as well as Ma&s;ters and Seamen.</P>
<P N="7">VII. They con&s;equently hinder their Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. They have heretofore (and therefore may be expected from them again) been the great Invaders of Property, and contrary to Law and Ju&s;tice, have taken from their Fellow Subjects their Ships and Goods, and granted Commi&s;&s;ions &s;o to do; and in all Differences with tho&s;e they deal with, have been Judges in their own Ca&s;es.</P>
<PB REF="2">
<P N="11">XI. They hinder all manner of Di&s;coveries of Places; and that ma|ny Ingenious Men would go upon, were it not that this Company will let none Profit thereby but them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="10">X. They ruin their Maje&s;ties Plantations;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By their not Supplying them with the quantity of Negroes ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By taking Exce&s;&s;ive Rates for tho&s;e they &s;ell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By furni&s;hing them with Negroes unfit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. By &s;etting what Price they plea&s;e on the Commodities the Plan|ters produce, they having the greate&s;t Command of the Mar|ket, there being but one Buyer for them all, and no Nation el&s;e &s;uffered to Trade with them; nor they allowed to &s;end their Product any where but to <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now all this as well hinders the Trade for <HI>England,</HI> as it does Injury to the Plantations of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>All that this Company pretends to about Charges of Pre&s;ents to the Natives of <HI>Guiny,</HI> maintaining of Factories on the Coa&s;t, Building and Maintaining of Fortifications, and Officers, and Souldiers, can better be performed by a Company regulated, as is already propo&s;ed, than by this.</P>
<P>But at <HI>Mingo, Alampo, Pittaw,</HI> the two <HI>Papaws, Arda, Quida,</HI> Old and New <HI>Callabar,</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> which are the chief Places of Trade for Negroes, the Company have no Forts nor Ca&s;tles, nor are at any charge, and therefore mo&s;t unrea&s;onable to exact from their Fellow-Subjects 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Trading thither, as they have done, and do.</P>
<P>This Company takes the &s;ame Cour&s;e now, as is propo&s;ed the regula|ted Company &s;hould do, but then its to whom they plea&s;e, and at &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Rates, that none can &s;uppo&s;e it is for maintaining their Forti|fications, but in plain terms a perfect Tax and Impo&s;ition upon the Subjects, that none &s;hall go about their lawful Occa&s;ions on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiny,</HI> except they will pay them 20. 25. and &s;o to 40. <HI>per Cent.</HI> a Tax greater than ever any King laid upon his own Subjects. So then this Company can have no pretence to a Patent, for they neither are fir&s;t Di&s;coverers, nor the prime Traders to this Coa&s;t, and therefore have no Rea&s;on to expect the Confirmation of their Patent by an Act of Parliament, to the De&s;truction of the re&s;t of their Maje&s;ties Subjects.</P>
