<HEAD>A Fight at SEA, two Ships taken by Prince Charles his Officers.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">And Prince Charles very ill, and in danger of Death.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Know many eyes are upon us, yet I doubt not, but that we &s;hall give &s;uch an account of this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of our undertakings here, as &s;hall give good &s;atisfaction to the Parliament.</P>
<P>It is true, wee were mi&s;taken in our fir&s;t thoughts, for it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the Sea|men would have all come in to the Lord Ad|mirall upon the fir&s;t Summons, Indempnity being offered them.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems they had not &s;o much di&s;cre|tion, as to make u&s;e of that offer when it was
<PB N="2" REF="3">tendred, For by means of &s;ome monies, and an high hand together, over the Sea men, they were &s;topt from comming into us.</P>
<P>Yet now they are in as great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words"> as ever, nay wor&s;e, for the Seamen flye out high again&s;t the Lord Willoughby and Sir <HI>Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk">s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> they have contracted to them&s;elves, by de&s;erting the Parliament, and that they did alwayes expect the per|formance of payment of moneys from them for they promi&s;ed it, and of them it is they expect to &s;ee it per|formed.</P>
<P>And their wants are very great, having &s;pent &s;ince they arrived in Holland, not only the pillage of their Piracies, but what they brought away from England.</P>
<P>Hereupon &s;everall Councells of Warre were called to con&s;ider what to doe, and upon advice there a|mong&s;t them, Prince Charles and the Agents have been &s;olicited by the Lord Willoughby, Sir John B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">|ten; and other Officers; And they have had good words, but no monies.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Lord Willoughby went to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> told him that there mu&s;t &s;ome cour&s;e be taken for mo|nies, or el&s;e the Sea-men would all di&s;&s;ert them, and that he could not keepe them in order without &s;ome thing for them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by.</P>
<P>Then his Lord&s;hip was de&s;ired to try what intere&s;t he could make for the borrowing of monies for the Prince, to give the Sea-men &s;ome pay, and that hee &s;hould do what he could to keep them in Order.</P>
<P>The Prince al&s;o declared unto him, that he would de&s;ire them that they would be contented (only) untill
<PB N="3" REF="3">the Treaty between the King his Father, and the Par|liament of England was ended, that they might &s;ee what the end thereof would be, and then they &s;hould &s;ee, that care &s;hould bee taken for them, either (in a &s;hort time) to have their Arrears, and all ingagements made good to them, or el&s;e that they &s;hould have both monies and provi&s;ions for further imployment, if the King and Parliament &s;hould not agree.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lord Admirall &s;ent to the E&s;tates of Holland, to de&s;ire that Van|trumpe might bee recalled from guarding of the revolted Shippes that de&s;erted the Parlia|ment of England, and others from the Par|liament were there &s;oliciting, that &s;o the Lord Admirall might have an opportunity to re|duce them.</P>
<P>And it was &s;o farre prevailed with the E|&s;tates of Holland, that an Order was pa&s;&s;ed that Vantrumpe &s;hould withdraw, and take of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> his guards, and tho&s;e &s;hips of theirs be im|ployed upon other &s;ervice for their owne country. But I know not how it came to pa&s;&s;e but &s;o it was, that either it was not &s;ent, or not obey|ed, but I &s;uppo&s;e there was &s;ome private countermand from the Prince of Orange, or el&s;e that Vuntrumpe dur&s;t hardly have denyed to obey tho&s;e In&s;tructions. And the E&s;tates have &s;ince made another Order to &s;end to Vantrumpe, to know the rea&s;on why tho&s;e Orders were not obeyed?</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P> Whether he was to withdraw pre&s;ently, or convey them out of Gowry (which is not pro|bable) and then withdraw, I cannot tell cer|tainly: but probably the latter.</P>
<P>The Hollanders are much di&s;contented to be at the charges, to maintaine them at their charge, for no benefit to them&s;elves, e&s;peci|ally having &s;o much u&s;e as they have for them at Sea.</P>
<P>But for (the future) perhaps they may not have altogether &s;o much u&s;e for them as for|merly, for the generall peace is now conclud|ed and &s;igned.</P>
<P>Now all this while Prince Charles his &s;ea|men goe on high in di&s;contents, and breake out into factions; their generall cry being monies, mony, and indeed I do wonder how they can make &s;hift as they doe.</P>
<P>And the Sea-men &s;ent to de&s;ire Prince Charles to come to them, and give them &s;ome other &s;atisfaction (for they were much di&s;|contented at the Prince for leaving them and going to the Hague).</P>
<P>Yet it hath &s;o fallen out, that they cannot be &s;atisfied in this; for Prince Charles is &s;icke
<PB N="5" REF="4">of the Small Pox at the Hague and is very ill of them, in great danger to fall into a Fea|ver.</P>
<P>The Duke of Yorke al&s;o and his &s;i&s;ter are neither of them well. The Duke it is beleev|ed will al&s;o have the Small Pox.</P>
<P>So that neither the Prince nor the Duke of Yorke can goe to them, whereby they are like to ri&s;e into an high di&s;order.</P>
<P>The Prince there by the advice of his coun|&s;ell about him, took into con&s;ideration what was be&s;t to be done herein, for their Order and Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>And it was concluded, that a me&s;&s;age &s;hould be &s;ent to the Lord Willoughby, and Captaine Batten, to know their mindes, and try whe|ther they could u&s;e a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters">s to &s;ettle and order the Sea-men untill the Treaty was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ded.</P>
<P>They returned An&s;wer, that they could not po&s;sible doe it without money, and that they could not tell how to undertake any thing in di&s;charge of their places except &s;ome provi&s;i|ons was made for the Seamen.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Prince by advice of his councell, concluded that the Lord Willoughby
<PB N="6" REF="5">and Sir John Batten &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. And that Prince Rupert &s;hould be made Admiral and that one Wel&s;h &s;hould be Vice-Admirally (this Wel&s;h is Robert Wel&s;h that came out of Ireland, a poore &s;neaking fellow) are not tho&s;e like to prove good guides to an Engli&s;h Navy. But this will not be &s;ufficient to compo&s;e the Seamen, and notwith&s;tanding their intenti|ons for &s;o it is de&s;igned to &s;end Landmen over them, to over-awe them, and put a force upon them.</P>
<P>The time of the Treaty they &s;uppo&s;e but &s;hort, and &s;o expect their work to be, and &s;o not much difficult. There are &s;ome of Prince Charles his Officers have taken two Ships be|longing to &s;ome Merchants of London, which they have &s;eized on, and plundered to a very great value.</P>
<P>Many &s;hips were ca&s;t away the la&s;t great windes.</P>
