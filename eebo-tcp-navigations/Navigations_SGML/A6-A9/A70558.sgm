<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT CONCERNING Several of the AGENTS OF <HI>NEW-ENGLAND,</HI> THEIR NEGOTIATION at the COURT of <HI>ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I May rationally &s;uppo&s;e that an Account of my Negotiation in <HI>England,</HI> where I have been attending the great Affair of <HI>New-England</HI> for more than Three Years, will be expect|ed from me.</P>
<P>When I began my Voyage from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> for <HI>London</HI> (which was in <HI>April,</HI> 1688.) <HI>New-England</HI> was in a very deplorable Condi|tion. He that was then Governour there, acted by an Illegal and Arbitrary Commi&s;&s;ion; and invaded Liberty and Property after &s;uch a manner, as no man could &s;ay any thing was his own. Wi&s;e men believed it to be a nece&s;&s;ary Duty to u&s;e all Lawful means to obtain &s;ome Relief and Remedy again&s;t tho&s;e growing Evils. This could not be done, without fir&s;t acquainting him who was then in the Throne, with the mi&s;erable State of his Subjects in that Territory. No man of common Prudence could be in&s;en&s;ible of the Hazard and Danger that woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">tend his Per&s;on and Family, in appearing at Court as a Complainant again&s;t a Governour that was King <HI>James</HI> his Creature.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>Neverthele&s;s, being encouraged by many of the principal Gentlemen in <HI>New-England,</HI> I re&s;olved to venture, th&ocirc; I pe|ri&s;hed in the Attempt, rather than to &s;ee my Countrey ruin'd.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> following, I had the favour of waiting on the late King: I mu&s;t acknowledge he was very kind and Obliging in his Expre&s;&s;ions, giving me Liberty of Acce&s;s in private to him whenever I de&s;ired it; &s;eeming to wonder at the things I ac|quainted him with, and profe&s;&s;ing that no man in the World &s;hould be more ready to relieve the People Interceded for, than he would. Notwith&s;tanding which, nothing was done for them all that Summer. And indeed, good words were as much as any one under my Character had rea&s;on to expect in King <HI>James</HI> his Court.</P>
<P>At the time of the happy Revolution in <HI>England,</HI> (being in|troduced by the Right Honourable my Lord <HI>Wharton,</HI> of who&s;e kindne&s;s all <HI>New-England</HI> has cau&s;e to be &s;en&s;ible; his Lord&s;hip having upon all Occa&s;ions concerned him&s;elf for them) I made my humble Addre&s;&s;es to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty (then <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI>) in behalf of that Countrey. There was a Circular Letter drawn up to be &s;ent to all the Plantations, and in par|ticular to <HI>New-England,</HI> to confirm tho&s;e Governours in their Places till further Order. Mr. <HI>Jeph&s;on</HI> (the then Princes Se|cretary) &s;hewed me the Letter. I a&s;&s;ured him that <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> would be undone, if that Letter &s;hould come to them: Within a few dayes he told me that he had acquainted His Highne&s;s with what I &s;aid to him: Who had thereupon Or|dered him not to tran&s;mit that Letter to <HI>New-England;</HI> But to all the other Plantations where there were Prote&s;tant Gover|nours. This was certainly an happy turn for <HI>New England.</HI> How would their Oppre&s;&s;ors have in&s;ulted over them, had &s;uch a Letter come into their hands! I knew that while&s;t that Peo|ple enjoyed their Old Charter they pro&s;pered wonderfully: But that &s;ince they were deprived of the Priviledges therein contained, their ruins were multiplyed; and that the Inhabi|tants were generally de&s;irous of being re&s;ettled as in the days of Old: for which cau&s;e I re&s;olved to do what was in me that it might be &s;o.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>Whenever I had the Honour of &s;peaking to the King, whe|ther at <HI>White-Hall, Hampton-Court,</HI> or <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> I &s;till mention'd the Charter, and always found that the King (although he judged it would be for the Advantage of <HI>New-England,</HI> to have a Covernor Commi&s;&s;ion'd by his Maje&s;ty, yet that he) was graciou&s;ly inclin'd to Re&s;tore Charter-Priviledges unto his Sub|jects in that Territory. Once, at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to bid me re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that it &s;hould be &s;o, if it were in his Power to cau&s;e it to be done. I advi&s;ed with many wi&s;e Men about this momentous Affair, who&s;e Judgment was, That the be&s;t, and mo&s;t effectual Cour&s;e would be, to endeavour a <HI>Rever&s;ion of the Judgment</HI> again&s;t the Charter of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> by an Act of Parliament; and after that, to Petition the King for &s;uch additional Priviledges as &s;hould be thought needful. I prayed Sir <HI>Henry A&s;hur&s;t,</HI> whom I knew to be a worthy Member of the Convention (as well as of this pre|&s;ent) Parliament, to concern him&s;elf for the good People in that Countrey: Which he did without much intreaty, being of him&s;elf forward to do Good: Nor is it po&s;&s;ible for <HI>New-England</HI> ever duely to Recompen&s;e him for his &s;incere Intentions, and a&s;&s;iduous Endeavours to &s;erve them. We both of us &s;pake to many of the principal leading Men in that Parliament: The I&s;&s;ue of which, was, The <HI>Commons of England</HI> Voted the Taking away the <HI>Charters</HI> belonging to <HI>New-England</HI> (as of tho&s;e in <HI>England</HI>) to be Illegal, and a Grievance, and that they ought to be Re&s;tored. A Bill was drawn up accordingly, which Pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> and was &s;ent to the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords</HI> for their Con|currence, on <HI>January</HI> the Tenth, 1689. A great Intere&s;t, in behalf of <HI>New-England,</HI> had been made among&s;t the Lords; but that Parliment being unexpectedly Prorogu'd and Di&s;&s;olv'd, a whole Year's <HI>Si&s;yphean Labour</HI> came to nothing.</P>
<P>When this pre&s;ent Parliament met, it was, for &s;ome Rea|&s;ons, thought not advi&s;eable to trouble them with the Affair of <HI>New-England.</HI> Some E&s;&s;ays were then made, to &s;ee if by a <HI>Writ of Error in Judgment,</HI> the Ca&s;e relating to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> might be brought out of <HI>Chancery</HI> into the <HI>Kings-Bench.</HI> But an unexpected Providence rendred an Attempt of that Nature vain. Never did I &s;ee a more &s;ignal Hand of Heaven in any
<PB N="6" REF="4">Matter, than in Di&s;appointing all De&s;igns, and Fru&s;trating all Hopes for Obtaining the &s;o much de&s;ired full <HI>Re&s;titution</HI> of all Charter-Priviledges, by a <HI>Rever&s;ion</HI> of the Judgment entred again&s;t them. There was now but one way left for the Set|tlement of <HI>New-England, &s;c.</HI> To implore the King's Royal Favour.</P>
<P>It was not in the King's Power to Rever&s;e the Judgment again&s;t the Old Charter; neverthele&s;s, his Maje&s;ty had Power to Re-incorporate his Subjects, thereby granting them a New Charter, which &s;hould contain all the Old, with New, and more Ample Priviledges.</P>
<P>This, Three of the <HI>Agents</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony</HI> Peti|tioned for; the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Monmouth</HI> con|de&s;cending to deliver that Petition with his own Noble Hand. After which, through the Interce&s;&s;ion of a Great and Wor|thy Per&s;onage, the King was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to referr the Affair of <HI>New-England</HI> to the Con&s;ideration of the two Chief Ju&s;tices, with his Maje&s;ty's Attorney, and Sollicitor-General. They Four met three or four times: They were &s;o kind as to give me leave to be pre&s;ent with them at all their Con&s;ultations. The Heads of the Charter belonging to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony,</HI> and of that granted to Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges,</HI> were pre&s;ented in Writing; together with what additional Priviledges we did at pre&s;ent pray for. They all thought there was nothing Un|rea&s;onable or Prejudicial to the King's Intere&s;t in what was reque&s;ted. The&s;e things were pre&s;ented to the King by my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt.</HI> The King ordered him to pre|&s;ent them to the Council; which was done on the Fir&s;t of <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> la&s;t; when they were referred to the Con&s;ideration of the Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee for Foreign Plantations.</P>
<P>Immediately upon this, the King began his Royal Voyage for <HI>Holland;</HI> untill who&s;e Happy Return nothing could be ef|fected as to the Settlement of <HI>New-England.</HI> In the mean time, I drew up &s;everal Rea&s;ons for the Confirmation of Charter-Priviledges granted to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony;</HI> which I di&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="4">among the Lords of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Honourable Privy-Coun|cil; and did particularly addre&s;s my &s;elf to the greate&s;t part of them, humbly praying their Lor&s;hips Favour to <HI>New-England,</HI> in a Matter which &s;eemed &s;o Ju&s;t and Equitable: And had a&s;&s;u|rance from many of them, that whenever the Affair of <HI>New-England</HI> &s;hould come before the Council-Board, they would do what in them was, that <HI>Ancient Rights and Priviledges might be Re&s;tored.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, a Noble Per&s;onage did me the Honour to in|troduce me to the Queen, that &s;o I might have an Opportunity to &s;ollicit Her Maje&s;ty's Royal Favour towards her Subjects in <HI>New-England.</HI> I a&s;&s;ured her Maje&s;ty, That there are none better affected to their Maje&s;ties Government, and that on that account they had been expo&s;ed to the Rage of the <HI>French,</HI> and other Enemies to the pre&s;ent Government in <HI>England;</HI> and that the King having referred the Con&s;ideration of the Affair of <HI>New-England</HI> to the two Chief Ju&s;tices, with the Attorney and Sol|licitor-General; we only prayed, that what they thought was rea&s;onable, might be granted to us.</P>
<P>The Queen graciou&s;ly replied, That <HI>that was a rea&s;onable Reque&s;t, and that &s;he hoped it would be done for us, only it could not be done but by the Council.</HI> Her Maje&s;ty moreover a&s;&s;ured me, That &s;he had divers times &s;poken to the King in behalf of <HI>New-England;</HI> and that, <HI>for her own part, &s;he de&s;ired that that People might not only have what was</HI> Ju&s;t <HI>done for them, but that &s;omething of</HI> Favour <HI>might be &s;hown to them.</HI>&mdash; I the rather mention this, that &s;o all <HI>New-England</HI> may be excited to Pray for &s;o Gracious a <HI>Queen.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>King</HI> returned to <HI>England,</HI> he &s;tayed not there above a Fortnight: In which time I had twice the Honour to wait on his Maje&s;ty in behalf of <HI>New-England.</HI> The Fir&s;t time I only delivered the la&s;t <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> from the <HI>General-Court</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton, viz.</HI> that of <HI>Decemb.</HI> 16. 1690. and a <HI>Petition</HI> from many Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> praying, That Charter-Priviledges might be re&s;tored to <HI>New-England;</HI> and that &s;ome Frigats might be &s;ent for the Security of tho&s;e Coa&s;ts. The Second time, I hum|bly
<PB N="8" REF="5">prayed the Continuance of his Royal Favour to his Sub|jects in that Territory. The King was then plea&s;ed to ask me, What I would have to be done for <HI>New-England?</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">I humbly put his Maje&s;ty in mind of our Old Charter-Privi|ledges: And that if they &s;hould, by his Royal Favour and Goodne&s;s, he re&s;tored, that would make his Maje&s;ty's <HI>Name</HI> Great in tho&s;e Ends of the Earth, as long as the World &s;hould &s;tand: That none of his Subjects prayed more for his Royal Per&s;on, and for the Succe&s;s of his Arms, than they did: That they were all of them Prote&s;tants, and that they differed in le&s;&s;er Matters from &s;ome others, being of tho&s;e that were called <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Congregational-Men:</HI> That his Maje&s;ty, in his great Wi&s;dom, had con&s;idered the Circum|&s;tances of <HI>England,</HI> and the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland:</HI> That, according to his Royal Wi&s;dom, he would con&s;ider the Cir|cum&s;tances of <HI>New-England</HI> al&s;o; and that &s;uch Rulers would not be agreeable to them, as were very proper to the other <HI>Engli&s;h Plantations.</HI></Q> The King replied to me, That within two or three days he expected a <HI>Report</HI> from the Committee of Lords, for <HI>Foreign Plantations,</HI> and that he &s;hould then &s;ee what could be done.</P>
<P>Two days after this, (<HI>viz.</HI> on <HI>April</HI> the 30th. 1691.) it was by the Lords of the Committee propo&s;ed to the King, Whe|ther he would have the People in <HI>New-England</HI> make what Laws, and appoint what Officers They plea&s;ed? Or, Whe|ther He would not appoint a Governour of his own, who &s;hould have a Negative Voice on all Acts of Government? The King was very inqui&s;itive to know whether he might, without any Breach of Law, &s;et a Governor over that Co|lony: (For we have a King now that will not Act contrary to Law.) The <HI>Lord Chief Ju&s;tice,</HI> and &s;ome other of the Coun|cil, an&s;wer'd, That whatever might be the Merit of the Cau&s;e, ina&s;much as the Charter of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;tood vacated by a Judgment again&s;t them, it was certainly in the King's Power to put them under what Form of Government he &s;hould think be&s;t for them. The King then &s;aid, That he was de&s;irous to promote the Welfare of <HI>New-England,</HI> as well as of <HI>England;</HI> and that he believed it
<PB N="9" REF="5" MS="y">would be for the Good and Advantage of his Subjects in that Colony, to be under a Governour appointed by him&s;elf: Ne|verthele&s;s, That he would have the Agents of <HI>New-England</HI> Nominate a Per&s;on that &s;hould be agreeable to the Temper and Incllnations of the People there; only that, at this time, it was nece&s;&s;ary that a Military Man &s;hould be &s;et over them; and that this notwith&s;tanding, he would have Charter-Privi|ledges Re&s;tored and Confirmed to them.</P>
<P>The next day, the King began his Second Royal Voyage for <HI>Holland;</HI> but an <HI>Order of Council</HI> was drawn up, inti|mating, That it was the King's Plea&s;ure to have a Governour of his own Appointing &s;ent to <HI>New-England,</HI> who &s;hould have a Negative Voice in all Acts of Government: And, That the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony</HI> &s;hould be &s;ettled on the &s;ame Foundation with <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. And that a Charter &s;hould be prepared accordingly. As &s;oon as I had a Copy of this <HI>Order of Council,</HI> I went with it to four or five of the Lords of His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Honourable Privy-Council: Every one of which, &s;aid, That as it was worded, it did not (in their Opinion) agree with the King's Expre&s;&s;ions or Intentions. Moreover, I cau&s;ed a Copy of this Order to be tran&s;mitted to my Lord <HI>Sidney,</HI> one of his Maje&s;ty's Principal Secretaries of State, then with the King in <HI>Flanders;</HI> praying, That if that Order, Signed by one of the Clerks of the Council, was not according to the King's Mind, His Maje&s;ty would graciou&s;ly plea&s;e to &s;ig|nifie his Di&s;-approbation thereof: But no &s;uch Signification ever came.</P>
<P>The Attorney-General, in the mean time, prepared a Draught of a Charter, according to what he took to be the King's Mind, as expre&s;&s;ed when his Maje&s;ty was la&s;t in Council. In that Draught, the Free men (and not all Free-holders,) had Power to Chu&s;e the Deputy-Governour, and the other General Offi|cers: And the King's Governour had not a Negative Voice al|lowed him in any Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>This Draught was pre&s;ented at the Council-Board on the Eighth Day of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t; when it was by &s;ome objected, That
<PB N="10" REF="6">by &s;uch a Charter as this, the King's Governour would be made <HI>a Governor of Clouts;</HI> and Order was given to prepare new <HI>Mi|nutes,</HI> or <HI>Heads,</HI> for another Draught: Which indeed made the Charter de&s;igned to be <HI>no Charter of Incorporation,</HI> and did deprive the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> of &s;ome E&s;&s;ential Priviledges in their former Charter. When tho&s;e <HI>Minutes</HI> were agreed on by the Lords, the Secretary of the Committee gave me a Copy of them; with an Order from their Lord&s;hips, That if the <HI>Agents</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony</HI> were not &s;atisfied therewith, they &s;hould bring in their Objections to Mr. Attorney-General. I &s;hewed the Order to the other <HI>Agents.</HI> Sir <HI>Henry A&s;hur&s;t</HI> went with me to the Attorney-General. I expre&s;&s;ed my Di&s;&s;atis|faction, perhaps, with a greater <HI>Pathos</HI> than I &s;hould have done, earne&s;tly prote&s;ting, that I would &s;ooner part with my Life, than <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> to the <HI>Minutes,</HI> or any thing el&s;e that did infringe any Liberty or Priviledge of Right belonging to my Countrey. The like I &s;aid to &s;ome Mini&s;ters of State: Who replied, That our <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> was not expected nor de&s;ired: For they did not think the <HI>Agents</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> were <HI>Plenipotentiaries</HI> from ano|ther Sovereign State; but that if we declared we would not &s;ub|mit to the King's Plea&s;ure, his Maje&s;ty was re&s;olved to &s;ettle the Countrey, and we mu&s;t take what would follow.</P>
<P>I drew up &s;ome Rea&s;ons again&s;t the <HI>Minutes</HI> propo&s;ed; Sir <HI>Hen|ry A&s;hur&s;t</HI> joyned with me therein; we argued, That the King had graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed a Re&s;toration of Charter-Priviledges to <HI>New-England;</HI> and that Charter-Priviledges might with as much and more rea&s;on be with-held from any, or all the Cor|porations in <HI>England</HI> which were never legally Re&s;tored, as from <HI>New-England;</HI> with &s;everal other Arguments too large to be here in&s;erted. Tho&s;e Rea&s;ons we delivered in Writing to the King's Attorney-General, who pre&s;ented them to the Lords at the Council-Board. I likewi&s;e cau&s;ed a Copy of them to be &s;ent over to the King in <HI>Flanders:</HI> Moreover, &s;ome Great Ones at Court wrote to &s;everal of the Mini&s;ters of State who were with the King, entreating them to u&s;e their Intere&s;t with his Maje&s;ty, that nothing might be Impo&s;ed on <HI>New-England,</HI> which would be grievous to his good Subjects there.</P>
<P>Some were apt to think, that if the King were in <HI>England,</HI> we
<PB N="11" REF="6">might prevail with his Maje&s;ty to &s;ignifie his Di&s;allowance of tho&s;e <HI>Minutes</HI> which were &s;o grievous to us; and that therefore it might not be ami&s;s to write to the King in <HI>Flanders,</HI> praying that a &s;top might be put to any further Proceedings about the Charter, until his Maje&s;ty's happy Return to <HI>England.</HI> I de|&s;ired a Great Per&s;on (whom I knew the Queen had an high E&s;teem of) to pray her Maje&s;ty to write to the King, That he would graciou&s;ly plea&s;e to Command that the Charter &s;hould Pa&s;s, as drawn up by the Attorney-General; or el&s;e that it &s;hould be Deferred until his Maje&s;ty's coming. The <HI>Queen</HI> was &s;o kind as to do this for <HI>New-England.</HI> I now concluded that nothing more would be done for &s;ome Months.</P>
<P>By continual Attendance on this arduous Affair, I had broken my Natural Re&s;t, and neglected my Nece&s;&s;ary Food, in&s;omuch that my Health was greatly impaired: Phy&s;icians advi&s;ed me to recede into the Countrey, and u&s;e Mineral Waters for my Recovery.</P>
<P>Before I had been there long, I had (and was &s;urprized at it) notice that the King had &s;ignified his Approbation of the <HI>Minutes</HI> which we were &s;o much concerned about; and that it was his Royal Plea&s;ure that <HI>New-England</HI> &s;hould be forthwith &s;ettled accordingly.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, a very great Man, and a great Friend of <HI>New-England,</HI> de&s;ired a Per&s;on of Quality to advi&s;e me to take up with what was propo&s;ed; withall adding, that if the King were in <HI>England,</HI> as Matters were now circum&s;tanced, nothing more or better could be expected. I immediately returned to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Principal Secretary of State a&s;&s;ured me, that he had received &s;uch a Signification of the King's Plea&s;ure as has been mentioned; and was plea&s;ed to let me &s;ee the Letter; wherein it was expre&s;sly declared, not only that the King did approve of the <HI>Minutes</HI> agreed unto by the Lords of the Committee; but that he did <HI>by no means approve</HI> of the <HI>Objections</HI> which the <HI>Agents</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> had made again&s;t them.</P>
<P>We then re&s;olved however to get as much Good, and prevent as much Hurt to the Countrey as po&s;&s;ibly might be. A Petition was Signed by Sir <HI>Henry A&s;hur&s;t</HI> and my &s;elf, praying, That no Property belonging to that Colony, or to any therein, might by the <HI>New Charter</HI> be taken from them, nor any Priviledges which
<PB N="12" REF="7">they had a Right unto: That the <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Mayn</HI> might be Confirmed: <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> added to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets:</HI> And, That <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> might be put under that Government. As to what concerns <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> we were told, the People there de&s;ired to be under any Government in the World, rather than that of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets.</HI> Great Oppo&s;ition was made again&s;t what was pro|po&s;ed concerning the <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Mayn,</HI> but at la&s;t it was granted; and <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> &s;o far as in the Charter is expre&s;&s;ed. Ju&s;t at this time, Letters came to my hand from <HI>Plymouth Colony,</HI> giving me the Thanks of the General Court there, for that I had pre|vented their being annexed to <HI>New-York,</HI> (which was by &s;ome Per&s;ons of Intere&s;t de&s;igned above a Year ago:) And intimating, That the generality of People there de&s;ired to have a di&s;tinct Charter, and be confirmed as a di&s;tinct Government among&s;t them&s;elves: But if that could not be obtained, that then, for the Lord's &s;ake, I would endeavour that they might be united to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> rather than to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>When I under&s;tood the Charter was fini&s;hed, and had been read before the Lords, I prayed that I might &s;ee it, and carry it to Councel; becau&s;e there might be &s;ome Clau&s;es in it which their Lord&s;hips might have &s;uch Rea&s;ons &s;ugge&s;ted to them, as they would think meet to expunge them, or to add &s;ome Particu|lars which might be Beneficial to his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in that Colony, and no ways Prejudicial to the King's Intere&s;t, nor yet incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e <HI>Minutes</HI> which they would not &s;uffer to be contradicted. This Reque&s;t was granted, only I mu&s;t return the Copy within a few days: An Eminent Councellor peru&s;ed it two or three times, and made his <HI>Remarks</HI> on it.</P>
<P>That Phra&s;e of <HI>Corporal Oath</HI> was altered, that &s;o no Snare might be laid before &s;uch as &s;cruple Swearing on the Book. A Clau&s;e was added, Confirming Grants made by the General Court, notwith&s;tanding any defect that might attend the Form of Con|veyance, that &s;o Mens Titles to their Lands might not be invali|dated, only for that the Laws which gave them their Right, had not pa&s;&s;ed under the Publick Seal in the time of the former Go|vernment. Some other Alterations we prayed for, but we could not obtain them.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion now, was, <HI>Whether we &s;hould &s;ubmit to this New Settlement? Or, in hopes of obtaining a Rever&s;ion of the Judgment
<PB N="13" REF="7">again&s;t the Old Charter, &s;ignifie to the Mini&s;ters of State, that we had rather have no Charter at all, than &s;uch an one as was now propo&s;ed to acceptance?</HI> I knew that in the <HI>multitude of Councellors there is &s;afety,</HI> and did therefore advi&s;e with many, and with Per&s;ons Unprejudiced, and of the greate&s;t Wi&s;dom and Ability to judge; with Noblemen, Genlemen, Divines, and Lawyers: They all agreed, that it was not only Lawful, but, all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, a <HI>Duty</HI> to &s;ubmit to what was now offered. Some &s;aid, They were very weak Men, and unfit to appear as <HI>Agents</HI> for a <HI>Colony,</HI> that &s;hould make any Que&s;tion of it. Others &s;aid, That a peremptory Refu&s;al would bring not only a greater In|convenience, but a fatal Ruine on <HI>New-England;</HI> and then Man|kind would lay the blame on the Weakne&s;s and Wilfulne&s;s of the <HI>Agents,</HI> who when they could not have what they would, ought to &s;ubmit to what they could get. The Opinion of the Lawyers, was, That &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ive Submi&s;&s;ion was not a Surrender, ina&s;|much as nothing was done under Hand and Seal: Nor could there be a Surrender in this ca&s;e, &s;ince Judgment was already Entred and Recorded again&s;t the Old Charter: Nor were the <HI>Agents</HI> ca|pable of Surrendring, as not being <HI>Plenipotentiaries;</HI> and that their taking up with this, did not make the People in that Colony, in Law, uncapable of obtaining all their Old Priviledges, when|ever a favourable Opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent it &s;elf; for the World knew, that in a pre&s;ent parting with any of their ancient Rights, they were forced to yield unto Nece&s;&s;ity. I remember, an Hone&s;t Lawyer, and a Well-wi&s;her to <HI>New-England,</HI> told me, That if we were put to our Choice, whether to enjoy our <HI>Old Charter</HI> (which he was well acquainted with) again, ju&s;t as it was, or to take up with this, (all things duely con&s;idered,) we were not wi&s;e if we did not chu&s;e <HI>this</HI> rather than <HI>that.</HI> It was con&s;idered, That a Judgment (right or wrong) not in Court of <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> but in <HI>Chancery,</HI> &s;tanding on Record again&s;t the <HI>Charter</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets,</HI> whereby it was vacated and annihi|lated, <HI>that</HI> Colony was fallen into the Kings Hands; &s;o that he might put them under what Governours, or what Form of Go|vernment he &s;hould plea&s;e. Their <HI>Agents</HI> might beg for a full Re&s;titution of all Ancient Priviledges, but they might not either Chu&s;e or Refu&s;e as to them &s;hould &s;eem be&s;t. It was con&s;idered, That there was no probability of obtaining a Rever&s;ion of the
<PB N="14" REF="8">Judgment again&s;t the former Charter. We &s;aw it was in vain to at|tempt to bring it out of <HI>Chancery</HI> into the Court of <HI>King's Bench.</HI> There were thoughts of bringing the Matter into the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords</HI> by a Writ of Error in Judgment; but it was believed that no <HI>Cur&s;itor</HI> would now venture to Sign a Writ of Error; and that if he &s;hould, the <HI>Lords</HI> would not be forward to concern them&s;elves in this Affair.</P>
<P>Although the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canturbury</HI> that now is, and many of the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops, are Friends to <HI>New-England,</HI> (as well as to all good Men,) and I have cau&s;e to acknowledge the per&s;onal Re&s;pect I have received from many of them: And although a great Intere&s;t has been made for <HI>New-England</HI> among&s;t the Tem|poral Lords; neverthele&s;s, when they &s;hould under&s;tand that the King was de&s;irous to have that Countrey put under another Form of Government, which his Royal Wi&s;dom judged would be better for them than what they formerly enjoyed, the Lords would be very &s;low in doing any thing that they knew would be di&s;&s;atisfactory to his Maje&s;ty. And if they &s;hould &s;ee cau&s;e to take the Ca&s;e of <HI>New-England</HI> into their Con&s;ideration, though they would not Ju&s;tifie the manner of Proceedings; yet when they &s;hould hear all that was to be Objected again&s;t the Governour and Company, on the Account of their having exceeded the Powers of their Charter in &s;everal Particulars, and in a very high degree, they would certainly judge that they had merited a Condemna|tion thereof. It was al&s;o Con&s;idered, That the Old Charter was, in more re&s;pects than one, very defective: For by that, the <HI>Government</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> had no more Power than <HI>Corpora|tions</HI> in <HI>England</HI> have. But tho&s;e Corporations have not Power in <HI>Capital Ca&s;es.</HI> Both the Judges and Eminent Lawyers have a&s;&s;ured me, that though Power was given to Corporations in <HI>Criminal,</HI> except <HI>Capital Ca&s;es be particularly expre&s;sed,</HI> their Power does not reach &s;o far: Nor was there any thing in the Old Charter concerning an <HI>Hou&s;e of Deputies,</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Re|pre&s;entatives:</HI> Nor had the Governour and Company Power to impo&s;e Taxes on the Inhabitants: Nor to Erect <HI>Courts of Admi|ralty,</HI> &amp;c. The King's Attorney-General (who is no Enemy to <HI>New-England</HI>) declared, the two Chief Ju&s;tices, and Sollicitor-General, concurring with him, That &s;uppo&s;ing the Judgment again&s;t the Charter of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> to be Rever&s;ed, if the Go|vernment
<PB N="15" REF="8">&s;hould exert &s;uch Powers as before the <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> again&s;t their Charter they had done, there would now be a Writ of <HI>Scire facias</HI> i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t them in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> and their Charter-Priviledges would undoubtedly be taken from them. And it was Con&s;idered, That if the Judgment again&s;t the Old Charter had been Rever&s;ed by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony</HI> would, for all that, have been in a far more mi&s;erable Condition than by the pre&s;ent Settlement they are reduced unto: For then the <HI>Province of Mayn,</HI> as to Government, would have been taken from them, &s;ince Government is a Tru&s;t that cannot be &s;old; and <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> (which would have been made to extend as far as <HI>Salem,</HI>) and <HI>Plymouth,</HI> would have been put under a Gover|nour &s;ent from <HI>England;</HI> which Governour would have had the Command over the Militia, and the Power of Admiralty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony:</HI> So that, in fine, <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> would have been deprived of Trade, and the whole Colony made very in&s;ignifi|cant: And if they had exerted Powers nece&s;&s;ary for the Suppor|tation of their Government, perpetual Conplaints would have been made again&s;t them. It was moreover Con&s;idered, That if the Agents of that Colony had &s;ignified to the Mini&s;ters of State, that they had rather have no Charter at all, than this which the King was plea&s;ed to grant to them, the Con&s;equence would have been, that they &s;hould have had a Governour wholly a Stranger to <HI>New-England,</HI> and a Deputy-Governour not acceptable to the People there; and many of his Councellors Strangers, and others of them &s;uch as were <HI>Andro&s;s</HI>'s Creatures; and that this Governour &s;hould have had the &s;ame Power which the Governours in other Plantations have, to Appoint the General Officers. They are very weak Men that doubt of this; and if they will look no further than their Neighbours at <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> they may &s;ee De|mon&s;trations before their Eyes &s;ufficient to convince them. It was likewi&s;e Con&s;idered, That &s;ome Per&s;ons in <HI>London</HI> were endeavour|ing to get a <HI>Pattent</HI> for all <HI>Mines, Minerals, Gums, &amp;c.</HI> in <HI>New-England:</HI> Which De&s;ign was, of late, likely to have taken ef|fect, only the New Charter has mo&s;t happily prevented that which would have been of pernicious Con&s;equence to all that Ter|ritory. It was further Con&s;idered, That by this <HI>New Charter</HI> great Priviledges are granted to the People in <HI>New-England,</HI> and, in &s;ome Particulars, greater than they formerly enjoyed: For all
<PB N="16" REF="9"><HI>Engli&s;h Liberties</HI> are re&s;tored to them: No Per&s;ons &s;hall have a Penny of their E&s;tates taken from them; nor any Laws impo&s;ed on them, without their own Con&s;ent by Repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by them&s;elves. Religion is &s;ecured; for Liberty is granted to all Men to Wor&s;hip God after that manner which in their Con&s;ciences they &s;hall be per&s;waded is the mo&s;t Scriptural way. The Gene|ral Court may by Laws Encourage and Protect that <HI>Religion</HI> which is the general Profe&s;&s;ion of the Inhabitants there. They may &s;till have <HI>Judges, as at the fir&s;t;</HI> and <HI>Councellors, as at the beginning,</HI> if the fault be not their own. As long as their Principal Magi&s;trates, Judges, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, are &s;uch as will encourage Vertue and Piety, and puni&s;h Vice, Religion will flouri&s;h: And if they have not &s;uch, the fault will not be in the <HI>New-Charter,</HI> but in them&s;elves; &s;ince no bad Councellor, Judge, or Ju&s;tice of the Peace, can now be impo&s;ed on them. The&s;e things are as a Wall of Defence about the Lord's Vineyard in that part of the World. The Ge|neral Court (now that the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony</HI> is made a <HI>Province</HI>) hath, with the King's Approbation, as much Power in <HI>New-England,</HI> as the King and Parliament have in <HI>England;</HI> which is more than could be &s;aid in the time of the former Government there, which had only the Power of a Corporation. The General Court has now Power to impo&s;e Taxes upon all the Inhabitants; and to make Laws which &s;hall Incorporate Towns, or Schools of Learning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which by the Fir&s;t Charter they had not Power to do. That Countrey may now expect Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>England,</HI> as the Matter &s;hall require, more than formerly. And although there are &s;ome things in this <HI>New Charter</HI> which are not de&s;irable, yet nothing that is intolerable. Take it with all its Faults, and it is not &s;o bad, but that when I left <HI>New-England,</HI> the Inhabitants of that Territory would gladly have parted with many a Thou&s;and Pound to have obtained one &s;o good. The great fear, is, that though at pre&s;ent there be a good Gover|nour (appointed by the King,) who wi&s;heth well to <HI>New-England;</HI> yet he will quickly be removed, and perhaps an Enemy come in his room. But I am morally certain of it, that if they hearken to the Advice of their be&s;t Friends, no Per&s;on not agreeable to <HI>New-England,</HI> in re&s;pect of Religion, and the Temper of that People, will be &s;et over them, during their pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties Reign, whom the God of Heaven &s;end long to Live and Reign.
<PB N="17" REF="9">Yet &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e: Suppo&s;e a Per&s;on as bad as <HI>An|dro&s;s</HI> (and the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> think there can hardly be a wor&s;e,) &s;hould come among&s;t them, What can he do? He cannot with|out the Con&s;ent of the Council Cho&s;en by the Repre&s;entatives of the People, appoint a Sheriff to pack Juries to &s;erve his turn; nor Judges that will act again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, ra|ther than di&s;plea&s;e him. Nor can he now &s;end Men out of the Countrey, without their own con&s;ent. Nor can he and his Crea|tures make Laws, or Leavy Taxes; nor Invade any Man's Pro|perty, under pretence that it is the King's; and that they mu&s;t come to him for Patents, that &s;o they may have a true Title to their Lands and E&s;tates. Nor can he, without violating the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> di&s;turb any Man for his Religion. The King's Governour has a Negative Voice in all Acts of Go|vernment; which may be thought a great Infringement of the Peoples Liberty; and indeed, makes the Civil Government of <HI>New-England</HI> more <HI>Monarchical,</HI> and le&s;s <HI>Democratical,</HI> than in former Times. Neverthele&s;s, <HI>the People have a Negative on him.</HI> In which re&s;pect, <HI>New-England</HI> is by this Charter more priviledged than <HI>Ireland,</HI> and than any Engli&s;h Plantation what&s;oever, or than they that live in <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf are. Appeals to <HI>England</HI> are al|lowed of by this <HI>New Charter;</HI> but only in <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> (not in Real or Mixed) <HI>Actions,</HI> where the matter of difference is above Three hundred Pounds Sterling in value. So that as to Titles of Land there cannot be any Appeal to <HI>England,</HI> but tho&s;e Con|trover&s;ies are to have a final Determination in Courts of Judica|ture among&s;t them&s;elves. And Laws Enacted by the <HI>General Court,</HI> are to be tran&s;mitted to the King for his Royal Approba|tion: Neverthele&s;s, tho&s;e Laws, when made, are to be in force as &s;oon as made, until &s;uch time as di&s;allowed of by the King: And if within the &s;pace of Three Years the King's Di&s;approba|tion be not &s;ignified, tho&s;e Laws are to be Perpetual, except by the General Court they &s;hall be Repealed. By the Old Charter, the Governour and Company might not make any Laws contrary to the Laws of <HI>England:</HI> And &s;uch rea&s;onable Laws as are not contrary thereto, will no doubt be Confirmed by his Maje&s;ty, if the People in <HI>New-England</HI> be not wanting to them&s;elves as to due Endeavours that it may be &s;o. All the&s;e things duely con|&s;idered, the Be&s;t and Wi&s;e&s;t Men in <HI>England</HI> thought that the
<PB N="18" REF="10">Per&s;ons who were concerned for <HI>New-England,</HI> would do an ill Service for their Countrey, if they &s;hould peremptorily decline a Submi&s;&s;ion to this Settlement, and thereby bring upon them|&s;elves that which would be more unde&s;irable.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave (for it is a Truth) to &s;ay this further, That whereas the People in <HI>New-England</HI> have not obtained all the Charter-Priviledges which they have at &s;everal times Petitioned Their Maje&s;ties for; they have more rea&s;on to blame them&s;elves, than tho&s;e of their Agents, who did their utmo&s;t to procure every thing for them which they prayed for. Had they at the time of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> entred upon the <HI>full Exerci&s;e of their Old Charter-Government,</HI> and then humbly &s;ignified to the King that they had &s;o done; and that they were per&s;waded, His Maje&s;ty, who declared, when Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> That Charters and Ancient Priviledges &s;hould be re&s;tored to the Engli&s;h Nation in general, would not be offended at them on the account of their adhering to what was their undoubted Right; wi&s;e Men are of Opinion that they might have gone on without di&s;turbance, until &s;uch time as new Complaints &s;hould be exhibited again&s;t them, on the ac|count of doing things which by their Charter they were never impowered to do. But in an Addre&s;s to the King, they a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, That <HI>they had not entred upon the full Exerci&s;e of their Charter-Government; but that not having received Directions from</HI> England, <HI>which they humbly waited for, they entred upon the Govern|ment for the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace, until &s;uch time as they &s;hould receive an Orderly Settlement from</HI> England; <HI>which they prayed might be according to their Old Charter, that had been unrighteou&s;ly taken from them.</HI></P>
<P>Now when wi&s;e Men in <HI>London</HI> &s;aw this: Will you (&s;aid they) who are Agents for the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Colony,</HI> refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to a Settlement of your Government from <HI>England,</HI> when your Principals have &s;ignified to the King that they will do it? Who gave you that Power of Refu&s;al? Has the General Court, in an Addre&s;s to the King, declared, They have not entred on the full Exerci&s;e of their Charter-Government, but that they wait for the King's Plea&s;ure, as to their Settlement; then &s;urely they have not given you private In&s;tructions not to &s;ub|mit? And if they have not, you cannot an&s;wer your Refu&s;al to your Principals, nor to the King, nor to Mankind. Have not
<PB N="19" REF="10">your Magi&s;trates cau&s;ed a new Clau&s;e to be added to the u&s;ual Oath taken by the A&s;&s;i&s;tants, <HI>viz.</HI> That if <HI>contrary Orders ar|rive from England,</HI> that Oath &s;hall not oblige them to &s;erve as A&s;&s;i&s;tants until the Year be expired? Shall then their Agents pro|te&s;t again&s;t &s;uch Orders?</P>
<P>Such as the&s;e have been the Rea&s;onings of wi&s;e Men in <HI>Lon|don.</HI> Moreover, the Government in <HI>New-England</HI> Petitioned the King to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with Frigats, and Supplies of Arms and Ammu|nition; which was, in effect, to pray for a Governour. They could not be &s;o weak, to think the King would &s;end the one without the other.</P>
<P>When I wrote to this purpo&s;e to a principal Per&s;on in Go|vernment there; the An&s;wer returned to me, was, That I, and other Per&s;ons that were employed as Agents for that Colony, ought to look on it as the principal thing committed to our Care and Tru&s;t; and that, <HI>preferrable to all other things what&s;oever:</HI> To endeavour the obtaining A&s;&s;i&s;tance from their Maje&s;ties, again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and other Enemies; and that this was the &s;ence of the gene|rality of the &s;ober People in <HI>New-England.</HI> So that if the&s;e two came in Competition, either to have the Old Charter ju&s;t as it was, or to get A&s;&s;i&s;ance from <HI>England;</HI> we were told we &s;hould be Unfaithful to our Tru&s;t, if we did not preferr the latter to the former.</P>
<P>Yet further: The Countrey was &s;o impoveri&s;hed by the Wars made upon them, as that they could not &s;end a competent Sup|ply to their Agents for the management of their Affair.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what was &s;ent to me out of <HI>New-England,</HI> I expended upwards of Two Hundred Pounds of my own Per&s;onal E&s;tate, out of Love to that People. And I did, for their &s;akes, bor|row of a Merchant in <HI>London</HI> above Three Hundred Pounds more, which was Two Years before care was taken for the Re|payment of it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Year, &s;ome who were hearty Well-wi&s;hers to <HI>New-England,</HI> wrote thither, That they mu&s;t con&s;ider, their Life, their Religion, the Welfare of their Po&s;terity for ever, depended on a &s;uitable Suppy for their Agents that were concerned in Tran&s;|acting their great Affairs at Court. This, notwith&s;tanding, for more than a Twelvemonth, not one Penny was returned: So that I was nece&s;&s;itated, either to &s;uffer Ruine to come upon the
<PB N="20" REF="11">Countrey where I had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of my Life, or el&s;e mu&s;t borrow Money again to &s;erve them: Which I did, and Engaged all the E&s;tate I have in the World for the Re|payment thereof: This is more than ever any man did before me, and perhaps more than any Per&s;on &s;o Circum&s;tanced as I have bin, will do after me.</P>
<P>And what was I able to do more? I do humbly affirm, That there is not a man in this World, that has done more, nor &s;o much, towards the obtaining of a full Re&s;titution of all Charter-Priviledges to <HI>New-England,</HI> as I have done. And as to the unde&s;irable Minutes in the New Charter, there is no per&s;on living that has manife&s;ted his di&s;&s;ent therefrom, or more oppo&s;ed, or done more to prevent them, than I have: But to reject all the Good therein, becau&s;e of &s;ome things in|convenient, is that which I dared not to be guilty of. As Day and Night have &s;een it, &s;o I can, and I do appeal to Heaven and Earth, that I have &s;erved that People with all Fidelity to the very utmo&s;t of my Power.</P>
<P>And now they mu&s;t give me leave to give them the be&s;t Ad|vice I can. I &s;hall not need (for they will do it of them&s;elves) to per&s;wade them to &s;end an Addre&s;s of Humble Thanks to their Maje&s;ties, for their Royal Favour in Re&s;toring Property, and in Conferring greater Priviledges on <HI>New-England,</HI> than have bin granted to any other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantation. And for that their Maje&s;ties have been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to put the pre|&s;ent Government of <HI>New-England</HI> into good hands. The Per|&s;on Nominated for Governour (Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI>) is one that has ventured his Life to &s;erve his Countrey. When <HI>Gideon</HI> did &s;o, the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were de&s;irous that he &s;hould Rule over them: The Deputy-Governour, Mr. <HI>Stoughton,</HI> is one who&s;e worth is known in both <HI>Englands.</HI> One of more than ordinary Accompli&s;hments, both as to parts Natural and Acquired, and as to Vertue and Integrity. And as for the Twenty Eight A&s;&s;i&s;tants, who are appointed to be of the Governours Council, every man of them is a Friend to <HI>New-England,</HI> and to the Churches and Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t therein. To be in the hands of &s;uch Rulers is an invaluable Mercy.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="11">
<P>As for me, whom the Lord Je&s;us has made u&s;e of as an In&s;trument in his Hand, for obtaining this Mercy for <HI>New-England;</HI> I de&s;ire no Acknowledgment, nor any Reward in the lea&s;t, for the Difficult and Expen&s;ive Service I have for their &s;akes gone through. Let me wait for my Recompen&s;e till the Re&s;urrection of the Ju&s;t. But if that People be not thankful to God, and to the King and Queen, for what has been done for them; not only the King and Queen, but the Maje&s;ty of Hea|ven, may ju&s;tly be incen&s;ed again&s;t them. To be thankful for what is given, is the way to receive more from God and Men.</P>
<P>But let me Propo&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>General Court</HI> do, without delay, agree upon a Body of Good Laws. They may make &s;uch Laws for the Settlement of the Militia, and for the &s;ecuring of Liberty to the Subject, as &s;hall be better than their Old Charter. And as to what concerns the Upholding of Religion in that Countrey, there are e&s;pe|cially Two things which may be done. The one, is, By Laws to Encourage an Able and Faithful Mini&s;try. The other, is, To take care that the <HI>Colledge</HI> be Confirmed in &s;uch Hands, as will make it their Concern to Promote and Propagate Vertue and Learning. It was in a &s;pecial manner with re&s;pect thereunto, that I did undertake a Voyage for <HI>England</HI> above Three Years and an half &s;ince. As long as that Countrey lay un&s;ettled, as to the Civil Government, I could not do much for the Colledge; only I prevailed with a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, to be|queath a Legacy of Five Hundred Pounds to that Society. And now, in this <HI>New-Charter,</HI> all Donations or Revenues granted to that Academy, are by the King, under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> Confirmed. I humbly propo&s;ed to &s;ome great Mini|&s;ters of State, That a particular Charter might be granted for the Incorporating that School for Academical Learning. An|&s;wer was made, That it &s;hould be &s;o, if I de&s;ired it: But that a better way would be, for the <HI>General Court</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets Colony,</HI> by a Law, to Incorporate their Colledge; and to make it an Univer&s;ity, with as ample Priviledges as they &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary; and then tran&s;mit that <HI>Act of the General Court</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> for the Royal Approbation; which would un|doubtedly
<PB N="22" REF="12">be obtained. I look upon this Particular alone, to be well worth my going to <HI>England,</HI> and there &s;erving half an Apprentice&s;hip; for that no &s;mall Concernment of Religion, and the Happine&s;s of future Generations, are comprehended in this Matter re&s;pecting the Colledge.</P>
<P N="2">2. I take it to be good Advice, That Judges, Sheriffs, Ju|&s;tices of the Peace, &s;hould be E&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the Pro|vince, of &s;uch as are Men fearing God; and that their Commi&s;|&s;ions continue, <HI>Quam diu &s;e ben&egrave; ge&s;&s;erint.</HI></P>
<P>However it &s;hall be, whether my Coun&s;els be followed or not, or whether my &s;incere Intentions, and unwearied Endeavours to &s;erve <HI>New-England,</HI> find Acceptance with them or no, I have this to comfort my &s;elf with, That God has been &s;o gracious to me, as to make me in&s;trumental in obtaining for my Countrey a <HI>MAGNA CHARTA,</HI> whereby Religion, and Engli&s;h Liberties, with &s;ome peculiar Priviledges, Liberties, and all Mens Properties, are Confirmed and Secured (Allowance being given for the In&s;tability of all Humane Affairs) to Them and their Po&s;terity for evermore.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXTRACT of a LETTER (WRITTEN By &s;ome of the mo&s;t Eminent <HI>Noncon|formi&s;t Divines</HI> in <HI>London,</HI>) Concerning the NEW CHARTER Granted to the Colony of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> in <HI>NEW-ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Much Honoured Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE mu&s;t give this true Te&s;timony of our much E&s;teemed and Be|loved Brother, Mr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather,</HI> That with inviolate Integrity, excellent Prudence, and unfainting Diligence, he has ma|naged the great Bu&s;ine&s;s committed to his Tru&s;t. As he is in&s;tructed in the School of Heaven, to mini&s;ter in the Affairs of the Soul; &s;o he is furni&s;ht with a Talent, to tran&s;act Affairs of State. His Proceedings have been with that Caution and Circum&s;pection, as is corre&s;pondent to the weight of his Commi&s;&s;ion. He with Courage and Con&s;tancy has pur&s;ued the Noble Scope of his Employment; and under&s;tanding the true Moment of things, has preferred the Publick Good to the vain Con|ceits of &s;ome, that more might have been obtained, if peremptorily in|&s;i&s;ted on. Con&s;idering the open Oppo&s;ition, and &s;ecret Arts, that have
<PB N="24" REF="13">been u&s;ed to fru&s;trate the be&s;t Endeavours for the Intere&s;t of <HI>New-England,</HI> the happy I&s;&s;ue of things is &s;uperiour to our Expectations. Your pre&s;ent <HI>Charter</HI> &s;ecures Liberty and Property, the faire&s;t Flowers of the Civil State: And which is incomparably more valuable, it &s;e|cures the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel in its Purity and Freedom. Although there is a re&s;traint of your Power in &s;ome things that were granted in your former Charter; yet there are &s;ome ample Priviledges in other things, that may be of perpetual Advantage to the Colony.</P>
<P>We doubt not but your faithful <HI>Agent</HI> will receive a gracious Reward Above; and we hope his &s;ucce&s;sful Service will be welcom'd with your entire Approbation, and grateful Acceptance.</P>
