<P>_ON the 9^t^h of this in&s;tant Septemb. Gen. Blake, and Sir George A&s;cue called a Councel of Officers to con&s;ult about the engaging of the Dutch Fleet; And accordingly with great alacrity and mutual affection it was re&s;olved to fight them; in pur&s;uance whereof, his Ex|cellency gave direction for a &s;quadron of &s;hips to be drawn forth, to be commanded by valiant Capt. Coppin, who &s;ailing to|wards them, &s;oon &s;urprized about 18, laden with Salt, Wines, &s;trong-water, and other rich Merchandizes, &amp; bound from Nants;</P>

<P>About two in the afternoon, the whole Navy advanced; and within ten Leagues of Scilley they di&s;covered the enemy, who made a &s;hew as if they would immediatly fight; but towards the evening declined En|gagement: The next day they appeared a|gain in &s;ight, but keep off at a di&s;tance; &s;o that the Gen: is in dayly pur&s;uit of them; Their lying off at the head of our fleet is thought to be in policy; for by a Scout that we have taken, we are informed that Mich. de Ruttier their Admiral is re&s;olved to fight us, onely he waves the di&s;pute, until the coming up of Vice-Admiral Evar&s;on from Zealand, who&s;e Mariners are &s;aid to be famous both for courage and policy. In the interim, we have taken ten more of their Merchants, viz. The Lyon of Flu&s;hing, the Prince, the Hopewel, &amp;c. each &s;hip carrying between 20 &amp; 30 Guns.</P>
<P>Several Merchants &s;hips having &s;taid at
<PB N="5" REF="3">the I&s;le of Wight for a convoy, at la&s;t ob|tained one from Port&s;mouth; and being all bound for London, they had not been long at &s;ea, ere they met with the Holland Fleet between Beachie and this Town; but the Frigat and a &s;hip bound from Morlaix be|ing mo&s;t to the windward than the re&s;t, kee|ping the &s;hore clo&s;e, run aground; the re&s;t being a head of them got away: The&s;e two being run aground, the enemy left them, &amp; followed the re&s;t above two hours; but all in vain, for they got &s;afe under our Ca&s;tle, and the other two got cleer off the next Tide. About which time, the Batchelor and Ann frigats gave fight to four Dutch-men of War, but being not able to maintain the di&s;pute, declined engagement, and recovered Mary &s;ound, getting off &s;afe, though above 100 Guns were fired at them. The famous &s;hip called the Faulcon of London, laden with Iron and Lemons from Bilbo is &s;unk neer the Lands-end.</P>

<P>WE have with un&s;peakable grief of heart long be|held the di&s;tractions of this our Kingdom; Our ve|ry &s;oul is full of angni&s;h untill We may find &s;ome remedy to prevent the mi&s;eries which are ready to overwhelm this whole Nation by a civil War. And although all Our endeavours tending to the compo&s;ing of tho&s;e unhappy differences betwixt U, Our Unele, and Cozen the prince of Conde (though pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ued by Us with all zeal and &s;ince|rity) have been hitherto without the &s;ucce&s;s We hoped for; yet &s;uch is Our con&s;tant and earne&s;t care to pre&s;erve the publike pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, that we &s;hall not be di&s;couraged from u&s;ing any Expedient, which by the ble&s;&s;ing of the God of Mercy, may lay a firm foundation of peace and happine&s;&s;e to all Our good Subjects. To this end, ob&s;erving that ma|ny mi&s;takes have ari&s;en about the expelling of the Cardi|nal, which happily may be prevented for the future, We have thought fit to propound to you, That &s;ome fit per|&s;ons may be by you inabled to tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t with the like number to be authorized by Us, in &s;uch a manner, and with &s;uch freedom of Debate, as may be&s;t tend to that happy con|clu&s;ion which all good men de&s;ire, The peace of the King|dom: Wherein as we promi&s;e in the word of a King all &s;afety and encouragement to &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;ent to Us, if you &s;hall chu&s;e the place where We are for the Treaty, which we wholly leave to you, pre&s;uming of the like care of the &s;afety of tho&s;e We &s;hall imploy, if you &s;hall name another place; So We a&s;&s;ure you, and all Our good Sub|jects, that (to the be&s;t of Our under&s;tanding nothing &s;hall be therein wanting on Our part, which may advance the

<P>Bring with you as firm Re&s;olutions to do your duty, and let all Our good people joyn with us in Our prayers to Almighty God for his ble&s;&s;ing upon this Work.</P>
<P>If this propo&s;ition &s;hall be rejected by you, We have done Our duty &s;o amply that God will ab&s;olve us from the guilt of any of that bloud which mu&s;t be &s;pilt. And what opinion &s;oever other men may have of Our power, We a&s;&s;ure you nothing but Our Chri&s;tian and pious care to prevent the effu&s;ion of bloud hath begot this motion, Our provi&s;ion of Men, Armes, and Money, being &s;uch as may &s;ecure us from further violence, till it plea&s;e God to open the eyes of Our people.</P>

<P>This Declaration being pre&s;ented to the Duke of Or|leans, it was with great alacrity re&s;ented by his Royall Highne&s;s, yet notwith&s;tanding, many giddy-headed and factious &s;pirits there are, who de&s;ire to be obnoxious to this pre&s;ent Treaty: Which to prevent, the new Cardinal of Retz doth take great pains, and endeavors what he can to mediate Affaires, not &s;paring his tongue or pen to come to an Agreement.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>We have received further adverti&s;ements that the Engli&s;h and Dutch fleets are en|gaged, and that a bloudy conflict hath hap|ned, divers &s;hips &s;unk, and many taken; the di&s;pute being maintained with great re&s;olu|tion on both &s;ides; but no ju&s;t particulars can be given at pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on they are &s;til in continual action: Providence &s;ome|times &s;miles upon the one: and &s;oon after frowns upon the other. We have taken a|bout 30 of the enemy in all; and many of ours are taken by Captain Brad&s;haw neer the We&s;tern Channel. The Patrick and Francis, two of the Scots Kings frigats, do much infe&s;t tho&s;e Coa&s;ts: The like doth the enemy about Yarmouth Roads, who de&s;perately atempted the taking of two &s;hips riding at anchor in Sole-bay; Upon which &s;ad tydings, we received this com|fortable news, that 100 &s;ail of Colliers are coming into the Downs, bound for London. The French at St. Mallows have &s;eized on all the &s;hips &amp; goods belonging to the Engli&s;h Merchants.</P>
