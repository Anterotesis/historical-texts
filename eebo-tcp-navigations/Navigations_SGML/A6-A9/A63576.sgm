<HEAD>A true Narrative of the late Succe&s;s which it hath plea&s;ed God to give to &s;ome part of the Fleet of this Commonwealth, up|on the Spani&s;h Coa&s;t, again&s;t the King of <HI>Spain's We&s;t-India Fleet,</HI> in its return to <HI>Cadiz;</HI> being the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;everal Letters writ and &s;ent by the Generals of the Fleet upon this occa&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>_SEven Ships in the &s;ervice of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> (being four of the Kings own Fleet, and three Merchants) coming from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> mo&s;t of them rich|ly laden with Gold, Silver, Pearl, and other Commodities: <HI>viz.</HI> The Admiral <HI>Don Marquis Del Porto,</HI> General; Vice-Admiral a Gallion, <HI>Don Franci&s;co De E&s;quevel,</HI> Commander; the Rear-Admiral a Gallion, <HI>Don Franci&s;co Del Hayo,</HI> Commander; a Ship commanded by Captain <HI>John Rodri|gues Caldron;</HI> a Ship commanded by Captain <HI>John De la Torre;</HI> another &s;mall man of War, and a Ve&s;&s;el of Advice from the Vice-Roy of <HI>Mexico</HI> to <HI>Spain:</HI> They did in Fifty eight days proceed &s;o far as within a few Leagues of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> without making Land, or touching at any place during the Voyage, having in their way betwixt the <HI>We&s;tern I&s;lands</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;agam</HI> in <HI>Africk,</HI> &s;eized upon a &s;mall <HI>Portugal</HI> as Prize; by whom, receiving a fal&s;e Infor|mation, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had beaten the
<PB N="2" REF="3"><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet from off their Coa&s;t a Moneth before, they &s;ailed with much confidence to|wards <HI>Cadiz,</HI> as not expecting oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet were at this time gone to the Bay of <HI>Wyers</HI> in Portugal (where they arrived the Eleventh of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t) to recruit their wants, and to be in a way of further Orders; the Ge|nerals leaving behinde them a Squadron of &s;ix or &s;even Ships (to have an eye upon <HI>Cadiz</HI>) under the command of Captain <HI>Stainer,</HI> Ca|ptain of the <HI>Speaker</HI> Frigot: which Squa|dron, on the Eighth of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, plying to Sea, being forced thither by a &s;trong We&s;terly wind, did at the evening of the day di&s;cover the &s;aid <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet five or &s;ix Leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Cadiz;</HI> and the approach of the night denying opportunity of pre&s;ent action, they endeavored to fall in with them the next day, which according|ly they did about Nine of the clock in the morning, (they &s;eeming to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be Fi&s;her-Boats) but there being a fre&s;h Galt that night, all but Three of the Squadron were to the Leeward, and could not pre&s;ently come in; and finding it to be the Spani&s;h Fleet come from the <HI>Indies,</HI> the <HI>Speaker,</HI> the <HI>Bridgwater</HI> and the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Fri|gots (not thinking it advi&s;eable to &s;tay for the re&s;t of the Squadron, they being within Four Leagues of <HI>Cadiz</HI>) ingaged with the Fleet, and a &s;harp Di&s;pute there was be|twixt them: The Admiral being a &s;mall Ship, and it being conceived that the placing of the Flag upon her, might be in policy to divert them from attending the Ships of
<PB N="3" REF="3">better value, they &s;lighted her, and &s;uffered her (with the Portugal Prize) to go into <HI>Ca|diz</HI> Bay, where (it's &s;aid) &s;he was run on &s;hore, and &s;unk, being reported to have in her Six hundred thou&s;and Pieces of Eight: The Vice-Admiral being reported to have in her Six hundred thou&s;and Pieces of Eight; be|&s;ides, in Iewels and Plate, upon the ac|compt of the Marquis of <HI>Badex,</HI> to the value of Five hundred thou&s;and Pieces of Eight; having fought Six hours, was taken by our Ships, and after &s;et on fire by the Spa|niards them&s;elves, and &s;o burnt down and &s;unk; and in her were de&s;troyed One hundred and ten men, the principal of whom was the Marquis of <HI>Badex,</HI> who, with his Wife and elde&s;t Daughter, were burnt: The Rere-Admiral was taken, and remains in our po&s;|&s;e&s;sion: The Ship under command of Ca|ptain <HI>John Rodrigues Caldron,</HI> which was &s;aid to have in her, Sugar, Tobacco and Plate, to the value of Six hundred thou&s;and Pieces of Eight, was taken, and in the bringing off, was by an accidental Fire burnt and &s;unk: The Ship under command of <HI>De la Tour,</HI> Twelve thou&s;and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Hides, and &s;ome quantities of Sugar, is taken and in our po&s;&s;e&s;sion: The &s;mall man of War having in her the like Lading with the la&s;t mention|ed, and the Advi&s;o-ve&s;&s;el being of no force or Lading, are &s;aid to e&s;cape into <HI>Gibralter.</HI> The value of what is taken and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, is not ju&s;tly known, but by the calculation of the Spaniards, there are taken and lo&s;t, about Nine Millions of Pieces of Eight, be&s;ides the &s;aid Ships and their Lading: There are
<PB N="4" REF="4">many Pri&s;oners taken, Three hundred and fifty being found in the Rere-Admiral, and about Ninety &s;aved out of the Vice-Admi|ral, among whom there are, the elde&s;t Son, a yonger Son, and Two Daughters of the &s;aid Marquis (be&s;ides a Childe): as al&s;o <HI>Don Diego De Villa Alva,</HI> the Governor of the <HI>Ha|vanna,</HI> and &s;everal others of quality, and Spani&s;h Merchants. And as all this was done without the lo&s;s of one Ve&s;&s;el of the Engli&s;h, &s;o it plea&s;ed the Wi&s;dom of God to chu&s;e to effect &s;o great a work by a little Force, as al&s;o by &s;uffering the Enemy to be fooli&s;hly en&s;nared into a pre&s;umptuous Con|fidence, by an Enemies Information, on which they &s;o relyed, that they neglected the haling of a Ve&s;&s;el which came from <HI>St. Lucar,</HI> and might have informed them of the truth.</P>
<P>By this Narrative, We &s;ee that the Lord who&s;e Right hand hath been heretofore &s;o Glorious in power for the help of his poor People in the&s;e Nations, in the time of their &s;adde&s;t Dangers, when their Enemies at home expected to have &s;atisfied their lu&s;ts in their ruine, hath again appeared on their behalf, in this day of their need, by blowing with his Wind, and cau&s;ing the Sea to co|ver their Enemies abroad, &s;o that they have &s;unk as Lead into the mighty Waters; which gives abundant cau&s;e to &s;ay, <HI>Who is like unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed glori|ou&s;ly!</HI> And as the eminency of this mercy in weakning the common enemy of Religion, (the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with whom this Com|monwealth is ingaged in a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="5" REF="4">War) and in encouraging and &s;trengthning the hands of his Servants, in a vigorous pro&s;ecution of that Engagement, is much heightned by the freene&s;s of it (being extend|ed to Vs, a Froward, Vnbelieving and Vn|thankful People, who had ju&s;t cau&s;e, rather to expect from the Lord a renewing of his Strokes, and to be &s;till kept under his Re|bukes, then that he &s;hould return to Vs in loving-kindene&s;s and tender-mercy, as he hath done in this late Di&s;pen&s;ation) So al&s;o is this Mercy the more magnified, by the &s;uteablene&s;s and &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of it, when his people were laid low in their own thoughts and expectations, and lower in the eyes and hearts of &s;ome that were lookers on; &s;o that We have cau&s;e in &s;ome mea&s;ure to &s;ay with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, Lord; thou ha&s;t been fa|vorable to thy Land, thou ha&s;t brought back the ca|ptivity of Jacob, thou ha&s;t taken away thy wrath, thou ha&s;t turned thy &s;elf from the fiercene&s;s of thine anger.</HI></P>
<P>And as We have cau&s;e to remember his Goodne&s;s, &s;o occa&s;ion is hereby al&s;o given to his People, to acknowledge his Soveraign|ty, and the un&s;earchablene&s;s of his Iudge|ments. <HI>He doth what&s;oever he plea&s;eth both in Heaven, and in Earth, the Sea, and in all deep places;</HI> and for this end, that men may learn to fear before him, <HI>He will render Vengeance to his Enemies, and his Salvation is nigh to them that tru&s;t in him:</HI> both which de&s;erve to be had in everla&s;ting remembrance, and to render him <HI>fearful in Prai&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, His Highne&s;s and the Parlia|ment looking upon them&s;elves and all the
<PB N="6" REF="5">People of God in the&s;e Nations, as obliged to all humble returns of prai&s;e and acknow|ledgement to the Lord, who hath been thus with them in their nece&s;&s;ity, have thought fit to appoint <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> being the Fifth of <HI>November</HI> next, to be ob&s;erved and kept as a Day of Publike Thank&s;giving for the Mer|cies vouch&s;afed as afore&s;aid, in all places within <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> And do order that the Mini&s;ters of the &s;everal Con|gregations, do on the Lords-day next before the &s;aid Fifth day of <HI>November,</HI> give notice hereof in their &s;everal Churches and Chap|pels; And upon the &s;aid Fifth day of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> read this Narrative and Order before the Sermon, for the better &s;tirring up of the Hearts of the People to prai&s;e God in re&s;pect thereof.</P>
