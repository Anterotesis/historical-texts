<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ON Thur&s;day being the 25 of this in&s;tant June, 1652. His Excellency Generall Blake weighed anchor with &s;ixty four Men of War; and having double man'd each &s;hip, hoy&s;ted &s;ayl about eight of the clock in the forenoon, to find out Vantrump; and (accord|ing to his Commi&s;&s;ion, and In&s;tructions, to fight
<PB N="4" REF="3">him: The whole Fleet being upon their motion, his Excellency gave Orders to Captain Holland, and Captain Mooton, to &s;cout forth with their two Fri|gats, the Star and Signet; but they had not &s;ailed many leagues, before they made a di&s;covery of cer|tain Hollanders; and bearing up to them, the re&s;t of our Fleet being about a league di&s;tance, Captain Holland gave them abroad &s;ide with ten Guns: the Dutch-men an&s;wer'd him with the like &s;alute: No &s;ooner had they exchanged four broad &s;ides, but im|mediatly came up the Star-Frigat, pre&s;enting them with &s;even broad &s;ides one after another: and com|ing to grapling, the musketiers on both &s;ides, main|tained the Di&s;pute with great gallantry and re&s;olu|tion; till at la&s;t, the Engli&s;h Red-coats, con&s;i&s;ting of Col. Ingoldsbys Regiment of Foot, plaid &s;o fa&s;t up|on them with &s;mall &s;hot and hand-granadoes, that they &s;oon cleered the Decks, fired the Mi&s;le and Main-&s;ail; and afterwards boarded two of the Hol|landers, killing 47, and &s;urprized about one hundred and twenty: Many there were that leapt out of the Port-holes into the Sea, and drowned them&s;elves, by rea&s;on that they bid defiance to the Engli&s;h, and cho&s;e rather to &s;acrifice their lives in the mercile&s;s Ocean, then yield obedience unto them. The re&s;t of the Hollanders, being eleven in number, after a &s;harp
<PB N="5" REF="3">conflict, declined Engagement, and &s;truck into their Harbors: This &s;udden On&s;et hath cau&s;ed Vantrump to call in &s;everal Squadrons; to the end, that his Fleet may be in an intire po&s;ture to receive the Enemy: Gen. Blake with his whole Navy lies about New|port point, within three leagues of the Dutch; and on Sunday la&s;t we hear that they fought; a Li&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;hips that engaged I have &s;ent you here inclo&s;ed, viz.</P>

Van|trump is preparing for another engagement and &s;hipping from &s;everal Ports and towns are coming to him: He hath al&s;o double man'd his &s;hips, both with Sea-men and Land-men, who hath taken an Oath and Prote&s;tation to live and die together, and to fight it out to the la&s;t man.</P>
