<HEAD>Sir Francis Drake REVIVED, Giving an Account of his Sur|prizing of <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and of &s;everal other nota|ble Atchievements perform|ed by him in tho&s;e Parts.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Whit&s;un-Eve,</HI> May 24. 1572. Captain <HI>Drake</HI> in the <HI>Pa&s;cha</HI> of <HI>Plimouth</HI> of 70. Tuns, his Ad|miral, with the <HI>Swan</HI> of the &s;aid Port of 25 Tuns, his Vice-Admiral in which his Brother <HI>John Drake</HI> was Captain, &s;et &s;ail, having in both of them of Men and Boys 73. &s;ufficiently provided with Nece&s;&s;aries for &s;uch a Voyage.</P>
<P>The Wind continuing at N. E. gave us very good Pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that in five Weeks after, we had &s;ight of the I&s;land of <HI>Guada|lupe,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
one of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> I&s;lands. The next Morning <HI>June</HI> 29th. entring between <HI>Do|minica</HI> and <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> we de&s;cried 2 Canows coming from a rocky I&s;land 3 Leagues off <HI>Dominica.</HI> Landing on the South &s;ide of it, we remained three days there to refre&s;h our men, and to water our Ships. There we &s;aw &s;ome poor Cottages built with <HI>Palmito</HI> Boughs and Branches, but no Inhabitants; the Cottages (probably) &s;erving only for the u&s;e of tho&s;e that came thither at certain times to fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1. being the <HI>3d.</HI> day after, about 3 in the Afternoon w&eacute; &s;ailed thence for the Con|tinent of <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and the fifth day we &s;aw the high land of <HI>Sancta Martha;</HI> but we directed our Cour&s;e for a Place, called by our Captain in his former Voyage, <HI>Port Phe&s;ant,</HI> by rea&s;on of the great &s;tore of tho&s;e Fowls, he and his Company had there, where we arrived in &s;ix days. It is a round Bay, and &s;afe Harbour, not pa&s;t half a Cables length over at the mouth, but within 8, or 10 every way, of 10, or 12 fathom water, full of good Fi&s;h, and of a fruitful &s;oil.</P>
<P>At our entrance here, our Captain having left his Brother to attend the Ships, with &s;ome few of his Company went to land. But as we were rowing a&s;hore, we &s;aw a Smoke in the Woods near the place our Captain fre|quented;
<PB N="3" REF="5">
therefore our Captain thought fit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter">o take more &s;trength with us, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome Enemy there. But this &s;moke was oc|ca&s;ioned by a Fire, which one Mr. <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>Plimouth</HI> and his Company had made, and had continued at lea&s;t five days before our Arrival. This <HI>John Garret</HI> left a Plate of Lead nailed to a huge Tree of near five Fa|thom about, in which were Engraven the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>Captain</HI> Drake, <HI>if you fortune to come to this Port, make ha&s;te away; for the</HI> Spaniards <HI>which you had with you here the la&s;t year, have bewrayed this place, and taken away all that you left here. I departed from hence this pre&s;ent</HI> 7th. <HI>of</HI> July, 1572.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very loving Friend,
John Garret.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Yet our Captain Re&s;olved to tarry here &s;till he had built his <HI>Pinnaces;</HI> and therefore cau&s;ed the <HI>Pinnaces</HI> to be brought a&s;hore for the Carpenters to &s;et up, employing the re&s;t of his Company in fortifying a place he had cho&s;en out to work in, being 3 Rudes, which he did, with Trees, thirty foot in height, round, leaving only one Gate to i&s;&s;ue at, near the Water-&s;ide, which was every night &s;hut up with a Tree drawn cro&s;s it. The Plat
<PB N="4" REF="6">
was of a <HI>Pentagonal</HI> form; two Angles were towards the Sea, and that &s;ide between them left open for launching our <HI>Pinnaces;</HI> the other four &s;ides were firmly clo&s;ed up. With|out the ground was rid fifty foot round. The re&s;t was very thick with Trees, of which many were of tho&s;e kinds, that are never without green leaves, till they are dead at the Root, (but there is one kind among them like our A&s;h, which when the Sun is vertical to them, and cau&s;eth great Rains, ca&s;ts all its leaves in three days, and in &s;ix days again becomes all green) of a prodigious height, &s;upported with &s;ix Buttre&s;&s;es growing out of their Body, in each of which three men may be &s;o hid, that they who &s;tand in the next Buttre&s;s &s;hall not &s;ee them. The Wood of tho&s;e Trees is as heavy as Bra&s;il, or <HI>Lignum Vitae,</HI> and is of a white Colour.</P>
<P>The day after our arrival, there came an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bark of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight, James Raw&s;e</HI> Captain, and <HI>John Overy</HI> Ma&s;ter, with thirty men. They brought in with them a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Carvel of <HI>Sivel</HI> (taken the day before) and a Shallop taken at <HI>Cape Blanch.</HI> This Captain was de&s;irous to joyn with ours, and was received accordingly.</P>
<P>July 20. Seven days after his coming, ha|ving di&s;patched our Bu&s;ine&s;s, we departed from that Harbour towards <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
within three days we arrived at the I&s;les of <HI>Pinos,</HI> and found two Frigates of <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> lading Timber thence.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Negroes</HI> in the&s;e Frigats we were in|formed of the State of the Town, and of a Report, that certain Soldiers were daily ex|pected from the Governour of <HI>Panama</HI> for the defence of the Town again&s;t the <HI>Symerons</HI> (a black People, who fled from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> their Ma&s;ters, by rea&s;on of their Cruelty, and &s;ince grown into two Kingdoms, the one to the Ea&s;t, the other to the We&s;t of the way from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to <HI>Panama.)</HI></P>
<P>Our Captain &s;et tho&s;e <HI>Negroes</HI> a&s;hore, that they might joyn them&s;elves to their Countrey|men, the <HI>Symerons,</HI> or at lea&s;t that he might prevent their going to alarm the Town with News of his Arrival, <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> being far di&s;tant from that place by land; and him|&s;elf re&s;olved to go thither with all &s;peed and &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>And &s;o di&s;po&s;ing of his Companies, ac|cording as they inclined, he left the three Ships and Carvel with Captain <HI>Raw&s;e,</HI> and cho&s;e into his four Pinnaces, fifty three of our men, and twenty of Captain <HI>Raw&s;es,</HI> well armed.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28. Thus parted from our Compa|ny, we arrived at the I&s;land of <HI>Cativaas,</HI> being twenty five Leagues di&s;tant, <HI>Aug.</HI> 2. where
<PB N="6" REF="7">
our Captain trained his men, delivering to each their &s;everal Arms, encouraging them with certain hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day we &s;ailed for <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI> Before Sun-&s;et we reached <HI>Rio Franci&s;co.</HI> Thence he led us hard aboard the &s;hore (that we might not be de&s;cried) to within two Leagues of the Point of the Bay, where we rode till it was dark.</P>
<P>When our Captain, finding tho&s;e of our Company propo&s;ing difficulties, re&s;olved to take the opportunity that Night; and &s;o we arrived there at three of the Clock after mid|night. About the &s;ame time a Ship of <HI>Spain</HI> had arrived there, who &s;u&s;pecting us, &s;ent her Gundeloe to alarm the Town, which our Captain perceiving, prevented, &s;o that we landed without any difficulty, and &s;eized up|on &s;ix Pieces of Ordnance, the Gunner ha|ving fled, whereby the Town was alarm'd.</P>
<P>Our Captain left twelve men to keep the Pinnaces, that we might &s;afely retreat in ca&s;e of danger, and &s;ecuring the Platform, he thought it be&s;t to view the Mount on Ea&s;t &s;ide the Town, fearing le&s;t there might be Ord|nance planted there, whence we might be annoyed; but &s;eeing no fear of Danger thence we returned to the City, where we parted; <HI>John Oxnam</HI> and 16 of his men going about behind the Kings Trea&s;ure hou&s;e, entred the
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Ea&s;t end of the Market, and our Captain by the broad Street pa&s;&s;ed to the Market place with &s;ound of Drum and Trumpet. The Fire|pikes were equally divided betwixt them, and proved no le&s;s advantageous to our men than frightful to the Enemy.</P>
<P>Yet the Inhabitants had put them&s;elves in Arms, and drew up their Companies in &s;ome order at the South-ea&s;t end of the Market place. And to make a &s;hew of far greater numbers of &s;hot, they had hung lines with Matches lighted athwart the We&s;t end of the Market place, between the Church and the Cro&s;s, but perceiving their Stratagem by us di&s;covered, they fled.</P>
<P>But the Soldiers pre&s;ented us with a volly of &s;hot, levelling &s;o low, that their Bullets oft times grazed the Sands: And we having once fired upon them, and feathered them with our Arrows (made on purpo&s;e) came to pu&s;h of Pike, when our fire-Pikes did us great &s;er|vice, where our men &s;ome with their Pikes, and &s;ome with the butt-end of their Muskets &s;o annoyed the Enemy, that they threw down their Arms to provide for their &s;afety by flight.</P>
<P>In the Cha&s;e &s;everal of our men were hurt with the Arms which the Enemies had let fall as they fled, which cau&s;ed us to de&s;i&s;t the pur|&s;uite; &s;o we returned to the mid&s;t of the Mar|ket place.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
Our Captain having taken 2, or 3 <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> commanded them to &s;hew the Gover|nours hou&s;e where the Trea&s;ure was kept. At our coming thither, the great door (where the Moyls u&s;ually unlade) was open, a Can|dle lighted on the top of the &s;tairs, and a Gen|net ready &s;adled: By means of this light we &s;aw a huge heap of Silver, being a pile of Bars about 70 foot in length, 10 in breadth, and 12 in heighth; but our Captain forbid any to touch it, but to &s;tand on our Guard.</P>
<P>There was in the Kings Trea&s;ure near the Water-&s;ide, more Gold and Jewels than all our four Pinnaces could carry.</P>
<P>When we were returned to our &s;trength, we were alarm'd with news, that our Pinnaces were in danger to be taken, and that if we got not quickly aboard, we would be overpower|ed with Multitudes of Soldiers and Towns People. Our Captain therefore &s;ent his Brother and <HI>John Oxnam</HI> to &s;earch out the Truth of it, who found our men in the Pinnaces much frighted, by rea&s;on of great Companies they &s;aw running up and down, &s;ome with Matches lighted, &s;ome with other Weapons from the out-parts of the Town, who came often near us, and, firing, retreated.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after there fell a mighty &s;hower of Rain with Thunder and Lightning, &s;o that before we could recover a &s;helter, &s;ome of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
our Bow-&s;trings were wet, and &s;ome of our Match and Powder dammaged; which while we were refurni&s;hing, &s;everal of our men were muttering on the fore&s;aid Reports of the &s;trength of the Town; whereupon our Cap|tain told them, he had brought them to the Mouth of the Trea&s;ure of the World, if they would want it, blame them&s;elves only; and therefore when the &s;torm was over, unwilling to give his men longer lei&s;ure to demur, or the Enemy further re&s;pite, he &s;tept forward, com|manding his Brother with <HI>John Oxnam</HI> and their Company to break the Kings Trea&s;ure|hou&s;e, the re&s;t to follow him&s;elf to keep the &s;trength of the Market place, till they had di&s;|patch'd their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But as he &s;tept forward, he began to faint through much effu&s;ion of Blood out of a wound in his Leg, he received in the fir&s;t encounter, which though it &s;marted, he con|cealed, till his fainting di&s;covered it, the Blood having filled the prints our foot&s;teps made, to the great di&s;may of all our Company, thinking it incredible, that one man &s;hould lo&s;e &s;o much Blood, and live.</P>
<P>And therefore tho' they would have hazarded much for &s;uch a Booty, yet would they not endanger their Captains life, but having gi|ven him &s;ome Cordial, and tied up his Leg, they entreated him to go aboard, that his
<PB N="10" REF="9">
wound might be dre&s;t, and then return a&s;hore, if he thought fit.</P>
<P>This, when they could not per&s;wade him to (as knowing, that if they went aboard, they could never recover that &s;tate again, in which they now were, and thinking it more honoura|ble to jeopard his life for &s;o great a Prize, than to leave &s;uch an Enterprize unaccompli&s;hed) they with force and entreaty carryed him a|board his Pinnace, abandoning a Rich Spoil to pre&s;erve their Captains Life.</P>
<P>Thus we embarkt, <HI>July</HI> 29 by break of day; many of our men be&s;ides our Captain were wounded, only a Trumpeter &s;lain; where|upon our Chirurgions were bu&s;ie in dre&s;&s;ing their Wounds, but e&s;pecially our Captains. And before we departed the Harbour, we took the afore&s;aid Ship of Wines belonging to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> But before we had her free of the Haven, they of the Town &s;hot at us. But notwith&s;tanding we carried our Prize to the I&s;le <HI>Ba&s;timien&s;es,</HI> or the I&s;le of <HI>Victuals,</HI> where we &s;taid two days to cure our wounded men, and refre&s;h our &s;elves.</P>
<P>At our arrival here, the Governour &s;ent to our Captain a Principal Soldier of the late &s;ent Garri&s;on, to view us, who at his coming pro|te&s;ted he came of meer good Will, for that we had undertaken &s;o great an attempt with &s;o few men; and that at fir&s;t they feared we
<PB N="11" REF="9">
had been <HI>French,</HI> of whom they expected no mercy, but perceiving us to be <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> their fears were the le&s;s, knowing, that tho' we took the Trea&s;ure, yet we would u&s;e no Cru|elty towards their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this fair pretence, his Governour had &s;ent him aboard, by rea&s;on divers of the Town had affirmed they knew our Captain, who had been often on their Coa&s;t la&s;t two years; he de&s;ired to know, 1. Whether our Captain was the &s;ame Cap|tain <HI>Drake</HI> or no? 2. Whether our Arrows, which many of their men were wounded with, were poi&s;oned? And 3. how they might be cured? La&s;tly, what Victuals or Nece&s;&s;aries we wanted, promi&s;ing to &s;upply us. Our Captain, though &s;u&s;pecting him a Spie, yet an&s;wered his demands; That he was the &s;ame Captain <HI>Drake,</HI> that it was not his manner to poi&s;on Arrows, and that the Wounds might be cured by ordinary Chirurgery; as for Wants, he told him, He wanted nothing, but &s;ome of that &s;pecial Commodity that Country yielded, and therefore before he departed he meant to reap &s;ome of their Harve&s;t they got out of the Earth.</P>
<P>To this the Gentleman replied, What then was the Rea&s;on we departed the Town at this time, where there is above 360 Tun of Silver ready for the Fleet, and a greater
<PB N="12" REF="10">
value of Gold; but when our Captain had declared the cau&s;e, he acknowledged our wi&s;dom in departing, was no le&s;s than our courage in attempting.</P>
<P>Thus with courteous entertainment, after Dinner, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in &s;uch &s;ort that he prote&s;ted he was never &s;o much Honored in his life.</P>
<P>After his departure, the <HI>Negroe</HI> afore|mentioned confirmed his report of Gold and Silver, and told us how we might acquire &s;tore of it by means of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> whom though he had very much incen&s;ed, yet if our Captain would undertake his Protection, he dur&s;t hazard his life, as knowing our Captains name was mo&s;t precious among them.</P>
<P>Whereupon we further con&s;ulted, and becau&s;e this place &s;eemed not &s;afe, next day we Sailed for <HI>Port-Plentie</HI> where we had left our Ships and recovered it next night.</P>
<P>At our return to our Ships, Captain <HI>Rau&s;e</HI> doubting of our &s;afe continuance upon that Coa&s;t, departed: our Captain in the mean time having put all things in readine&s;s re&s;ol|ved with his 2 Ships and 3 Pinnaces to go to <HI>Carthagene.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 13 We came to an Anchor in 3 Fathom Water, between the I&s;lands of <HI>Cha|re&s;ha</HI> and St. <HI>Bernards.</HI> Our Captain led
<PB N="13" REF="10">
the Pinnaces about the I&s;land into the Har|bour of <HI>Carthagene;</HI> where he found a Fri|gate at Anchor, &amp; one man only aboard, who being askt for the re&s;t of his company, told they were gone a&s;hore that evening; that 2 hours before night there pa&s;t by a Pinnace making all &s;peed they could, and askt him if any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> had been there late|ly, and upon An&s;wer that none had been, they bid them look to them&s;elves: that after this Pinnace was come to the out-parts of <HI>Carthagene</HI> many great Pieces were &s;hot off; whereupon one going to the Topma&s;t e&s;pied over the Land diver&s;e Frigates bringing them&s;elves within the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This report our Captain credited; and having further examined this old Mariner, he under&s;tood that there was within the next Point a great Ship of <HI>Sivel</HI> ready to Sail next morning for <HI>Domingo,</HI> and taking this old man into the Pinnace he rowed towards this Ship, which we boarded. As &s;oon as we were on the Decks we threw down the Gates and Spare-decks to prevent the dan|ger of clo&s;s Fight; and then we cut her Cables, and towed her with our three Pin|naces without the I&s;land, without danger of their great &s;hot.</P>
<P>Which when the Town heard of, they put them&s;elves into readine&s;s, and came
<PB N="14" REF="11">
down to the very point of the Wood, a|gain&s;t us.</P>
<P>The next morning we took two Frigats, in which were two of the Kings <HI>Scrivano's</HI> with 7 Mariners and 2 <HI>Negroes,</HI> come from <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and bound for <HI>Carthagene,</HI> to certifie them of our aforementioned ex|ploit at <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI> Yet our Captain at the <HI>Scrivano's</HI> entreaties &s;et all the Com|pany a &s;hore, and then bare up to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Bernards,</HI> three Leagues off the Town.</P>
<P>Our Captain now con&s;idering that he was di&s;covered, found that he mu&s;t wait &s;ome time before he could accompli&s;h his de&s;ign, and likewi&s;e that his Pinnaces mu&s;t be well mann'd; in order to which he had a de&s;ign to burn one of the Ships and make the other a Storehou&s;e; but finding that his Company would be loth of that, he thought of ano|ther expedient; and therefore &s;ent for <HI>Tho|mas Moon</HI> (Carpenter in the <HI>Swan)</HI> and de|&s;ired him to bore &s;everal holes in the Well of that Ship as near the Keel as he could, and that with all &s;ecre&s;ie. He was very aver&s;e from doing it, but having heard our Cap|tains rea&s;ons, he was at la&s;t per&s;waded, and did it accordingly.</P>
<P>The next morning our Captain de&s;igned to go a Fi&s;hing, and going aboard the <HI>Swan</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="11">
he de&s;ired his Brother to go with him, who de&s;ired him to &s;tay alittle and he would immediately attend him. Our Captain per|ceiving the Carpenter had fulfilled his de|&s;ire, demanded of them why their Bark was &s;o deep? Whereupon his Brother &s;ent one down to the Steward to know what was the matter; who going down immediately alarum'd them with news that the Ship was full of Water. Whereupon all hands were &s;et to work, but all in vain; Our Captain con&s;ulting with them about it, found, that de&s;pairing of &s;aving her they referred to him what &s;hould be done: And therefore he propo&s;ed to them that he would go into the Pinnace till &s;uch time as a Frigate were provided, and that his Brother &s;hould be Captain in the Admiral, and the Ma&s;ter &s;hould be al&s;o there with him in&s;tead of this; which &s;eeing &s;he could not be &s;aved he would have fired that the Enemy might not have her, but fir&s;t that every one &s;hould take out of her what they lacked or liked. This was put in execution that night, and &s;o our Captain had his de&s;ire, having now men enough for his Pinnaces.</P>
<P>The next day we re&s;olved to &s;eek out a fit place in the Sound of <HI>Dorienne</HI> where we might leave our Ship at Anchor undi&s;|covered by the Enemy: that &s;o the Enemy
<PB N="16" REF="12">
imagining us departed we might better fol|low our purpo&s;es with our Pinnaces.</P>
<P>And accordingly we departed for the &s;aid Sound, and in 5 days reached it, where we &s;tayed 15 days, keeping very clo&s;e, that our Enemies might think we were departed.</P>
<P>Here we were not Idle, but be&s;ides our trimming and fitting our Pinnaces, he cau|&s;ed us rid a Plat of Ground to build us Hou&s;es for our Lodging, wherein the <HI>Negroe</HI> was &s;erviceable to us. As al&s;o at &s;pare times we had &s;everal &s;orts of recreations as every man fancied.</P>
<P>After the fifteen days expired, our Cap|tain leaving the Ship with his Brother took 2 Pinnaces for <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Carthagene,</HI> when we were within 2 Lea|gues of the River we Landed to the We&s;t|wards on the Main. Where &s;eeing &s;ome <HI>In|dians,</HI> they asked us what we would have? and knowing we de&s;ired fre&s;h Victuals they brought us &s;ome; for which courte&s;ie our Captain &s;ufficiently rewarded them.</P>
<P>Thence we departed to <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> where we entred at 3 in the Afternoon. From thence till night we rowed up the &s;tream, making but &s;mall progre&s;s. We moared our Pinnaces to a Tree that night, by rea&s;on of a huge &s;hower of Rain with Terrible Claps of Thunder, (which is u&s;ual there
<PB N="17" REF="12">
and continues about three quarters of an hour) after which it was very calm, and then we were infe&s;ted with Flies called <HI>Mushitos</HI> (like our Gnats) which bite &s;pite|fully; our be&s;t remedy again&s;t them was Juice of Lemons.</P>
<P>At Break of day we departed up the River; where we e&s;pied a Canow with 2 <HI>Indians</HI> fi&s;hing in the River, but we &s;poke not to them for being de&s;cried, nor they to us, think|ing us <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Afterwards we e&s;pied cer|tain hou&s;es on the other &s;ide the River. And a <HI>Spaniard</HI> which kept tho&s;e hou&s;es thinking us his Country men, made a Smoke, for a &s;ign to us to turn that way, but when we drew near him, he &s;aw his mi&s;take, and &s;o fled from his hou&s;es, which were 5 in num|ber full of white Rusk, Bacon with &s;everal other Provi&s;ions, to &s;erve the Fleet return|ing to Spain. With &s;tore of this we loaded our Pinnaces, and ha&s;tned our departure, by rea&s;on of intelligence we had of certain <HI>In|dians,</HI> that the Frigats (30 in number which u&s;ually tran&s;port Merchandi&s;e out of <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> &amp; thence to the&s;e hou&s;es, and &s;o in <HI>Canows</HI> up to <HI>Nueva Reyno,</HI> and return in Exchange, Gold Trea&s;ure and Commodi|ties of that Kingdom) were not returned from <HI>Cartagena</HI> &s;ince the fir&s;t report of our being there.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="13">
<HI>Sep.</HI> 10. As we returned to our Pin|naces the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ent down the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Villa del Rey,</HI> with Bows and Arrows again&s;t us, but we rowed down the Stream, one League, and Anchored till the morning, then we got to the Mouth of the River, where we unladed our Provi&s;ions, clean&s;ed our Pinnaces, and took it in again, and then went We&s;tward.</P>
<P><HI>Sep.</HI> 11. Between <HI>Cartagena</HI> and <HI>Tolou</HI> we took 5 or 6 Frigats laden with Victuals; we &s;et the Men at liberty, having heard all we could of 'em, keeping only two of the Frigats well &s;tored with Victuals.</P>
<P>Three days after, we arrived at <HI>Port-plen|ty,</HI> where we built 4 Store-hou&s;es, to keep our Provi&s;ion in, &s;everal Leagues a&s;under, that if the Enemy &s;hould &s;urprize any one, we might be furni&s;hed by another, our <HI>Negroes</HI> being very u&s;eful to us in this Work.</P>
<P>At this time Captain <HI>John Drake</HI> fortu|nately found out the <HI>Symerons</HI> as he rowed aloaf the Shore, by the direction of our a|fore&s;aid <HI>Negroe, Diego,</HI> who calling to the <HI>Symerons,</HI> dealt &s;o effectually with them that he gave and received two men, as pledges of Fidelity, appointing a meeting next day at a River, midway, between the <HI>Cabezas</HI> and our Ships, called <HI>Rio Diego.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two being well qualified men, did
<PB N="19" REF="13">
with all reverence, declare to our Captain their great joy conceived by his arrival, as knowing him to be an Enemy to the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> and therefore were ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t their Enemies to the utmo&s;t: and that their captain did then &s;tay at the mouth of <HI>Rio Diego</HI> to attend his plea&s;ure, and that they would have come by Land to this place, but that the way is very trouble&s;ome, by rea&s;on of &s;teep Mountains, deep Rivers and thick Brakes; de&s;iring therefore our Captain would take order about it: Our Captain weighing their Speech with former Intelligence, and comparing it with their great kindne&s;s towards his Brother; re&s;ol|ved with his Brother and the two <HI>Symerons,</HI> in his two Pinnaces, to go towards the River, which he did that night; ordering the re&s;t of their company to follow them next mor|ning, becau&s;e there was a place of great &s;afe|ty. The &s;afety of it con&s;i&s;ted not only that it was a fruitful Countrey, and that no <HI>Spa|niards</HI> were there, but e&s;pecially that it ly|eth among a great many goodly I&s;lands full of Trees, where, though there be Channels, yet there are &s;uch Rocks and Shoals that no man can enter by night, nor by day without di&s;covery: whereas our Ship might lye hid|den within the Trees.</P>
<P><HI>Sep.</HI> 14. The next day we met with them
<PB N="20" REF="14">
at the afore&s;aid place, the re&s;t being at a miles di&s;tance. After we had entertained them, and received te&s;timonies of their good will, we took 2 more of them into our Pin|naces, leaving our 2 men with them, ap|pointing a meeting with them and &s;ome more at the River <HI>Guana.</HI> So we departed to|wards our Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 16. Two days after we found her, being much damnified by tempe&s;t. And ha|ving repaired her, <HI>Sept.</HI> 18. Our Captain &s;ent a Pinnace towards the bottom of the Bay, to found out the Channel, for the bringing her in, and the next day got her &s;afe into the be&s;t Channel; it was 5 miles di&s;tant from the <HI>Cativaas</HI> betwixt the I&s;land and the Main, being very narrow, and full of bu&s;hes. We had &s;carce &s;etled there when our 2 men with the Troup of <HI>Symerons</HI> came in &s;ight of our Ship, whom we brought aboard.</P>
<P>Our Captain de&s;iring they would put him in a way to procure Gold, they told him if they had known of it before, they could have given him &s;tore of it (as having taken a great quantity from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> which they &s;unk into the River) which now they could not do, becau&s;e the Rivers in which it was thrown were very high, and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the&s;e rainy months u&s;e not to carry their Trea&s;ure
<PB N="21" REF="14">
by Land. This an&s;wer &s;atisfied us of their hone&s;t meaning towards us. Therefore our Captain re&s;olved for the&s;e 5 months to &s;tay a Shore, and &s;o <HI>Sept.</HI> 24. we built hou&s;es for our aboad that time, and a Fort Triangle wi&s;e, 13 foot high. But after 14 days repo&s;e here, our Captain purpo&s;ing to go to <HI>Cartagena</HI> with 3 Pinnaces, left his Brother to govern tho&s;e left behind with the <HI>Symerons</HI> to fini&s;h the Fort begun.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 7. Thus we &s;et Sail and came that night to an I&s;land (which he called <HI>Spurkite,</HI> from great &s;tore of Birds in that &s;hape.) The next day we were clear of the&s;e I|&s;lands, and about 4 days after, near the I|&s;land of St. <HI>Bernards</HI> we cha&s;ed 2 Frigates a&s;hore, and recovering one of the I&s;lands we &s;tayed there 2 days to wa&s;h our Pinnaces and catch Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 16. Thence we went towards <HI>Tolou</HI> and landed in a Garden where certain <HI>Indi|ans</HI> delivered us their Bows and Arrows and gave us &s;uch fruit, as the place yielded, for which we requited them. Our Captains de|&s;ign in taking tho&s;e places was to learn the true &s;tate of the Country and the Fleets.</P>
<P>Thence we went towards <HI>Chare&s;ha</HI> the I&s;land of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> where we let fall our Grappers betwixt the I&s;land and the Main over again&s;t the goodly Garden I&s;land. Our

Captain, would not &s;uffer us to land there, knowing it would have proved dangerous; and within 3 hours after, pa&s;&s;ing by the Point of the I&s;land, we had a volly of 100 &s;hot from them; and yet but one of our men was hurt.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 17. This evening we departed to Sea, and the next morning we took a Bark, which we ea&s;ily boarded, for that the Cap|tain with mo&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;engers had gone a|&s;hore. She had in her great &s;tore of Sope and Sweet-meats bound from St. <HI>Domingo</HI> to <HI>Cartagena. Oct.</HI> 18. The next day we &s;et all the men a&s;hore (&s;ave a young <HI>Negroe</HI> we kept) but kept the Bark, and in her bare to the mouth of <HI>Cartagena</HI> Harbor, and An|chored.</P>
<P>That, Afternoon &s;ome Hor&s;emen came down with the <HI>Scrivano</HI> aforementioned to the point, and held up a Truce Flag, de&s;iring &s;afe conduct to our Ship; which granted the <HI>Scrivano</HI> came a board, and thanking our Captain for former courte&s;ies, he promi&s;ed that night to procure us &s;tore of Victuals, whatever di&s;plea&s;ure he might incur thereby. But we found this only a device of the Go|vernor's to delay time till they were of &s;uf|ficient &s;trength to entrap us; and therefore we put to Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 20. The next day in the Afternoon we took 2 Frigates come from <HI>Cartagena,</HI> the
<PB N="23" REF="15">
one of 50 the other of 12 Tuns, having only balla&s;t in them; we kept the Frigats but &s;et the men a&s;hore in the great Frigats Gun|delow.</P>
<P>The next morning they came down to the We&s;ter Point with a Truce Flag; &amp; our Cap|tain manned one Pinnace and rowed a&s;hore; when we were near the &s;hore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fled into the Wood as afraid of us, but in|deed 'twas only to draw us on; as we reach|ed the Land our Captain leaped a&s;hore in their &s;ight, but made no &s;tay; when he was come aboard again, we haled off and rode a while; They came forth again, and &s;ent a youth to demand what was our intent to &s;tay thus upon the Coa&s;t? Our Captain an&s;wered, for Traffick; he &s;ent him again to &s;hew him that 'twas prohibit, to Traffick with Foreign People for any thing except Powder. He an&s;wered he was come to exchange his com|modities for Gold and Silver and was purpo|&s;ed to effect it. However he gave this Me&s;|&s;enger a Shirt for his reward.</P>
<P>We heard no an&s;wer all that day but kept in our Frigats, keeping good watch all night. The next morning the wind turned Ea&s;terly, and we-&s;aw two Sails (which were &s;ent from <HI>Cartagena</HI> to fight us) com|ing to us; whereupon our Captain went to encounter them, and approaching them we
<PB N="24" REF="16">
&s;aw many men aboard them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the Shore thought to recover their Frigats (being left unmanned) while we were bu|&s;ied with the other. But our Captain pre|vented it, for leaving <HI>John Oxnam</HI> to treat tho&s;e two Ships, he made &s;peed to his Fri|gats, and cau&s;ed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> con&s;ult to &s;ave their lives by flight, leaving &s;everal of their weapons behind them. And &s;eeing he could not man them, he burnt the one and &s;unk the other. This done he returned to <HI>John Oxnam</HI> (who all this while lay &s;ilent by the Men of War) and the wind blowing from Sea, we were forced to bear into the Har|bor before them, they &s;uppo&s;ing we fled; but as &s;oon as we felt &s;mooth Water, getting the wind, we fought them at advantage, &s;o that they were willing to pre&s;s no nigher: and as they let fall their Anchors, we drop|ed ours in the wind of them. They &s;eeing no gain to be had of us retired to the Town; but we by rea&s;on of bad weather Rode there 4 days.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 27. A Frigat came from Sea, and &s;eeing us, ran her &s;elf a&s;hore, unhanging her Rudder and throwing away her Sails; when we were come up to her, a party came down to the point of the Main, whom we by our &s;hot cau&s;ed quickly retire into the Woods. Whereupon we went to Sea with intent to
<PB N="25" REF="16">
ride at the Rock called <HI>Las Serenas</HI> 2 Leagues off, but through tempe&s;t were forced to return into the Harbor. But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had a new device; for they &s;ent forth a Party again&s;t us, who at our encountring them fled with intent to draw us after them, having an ambu&s;h &s;et for us; be&s;ides, 2 Pinnaces well mann'd came towards us and attacqued us boldly; and &s;eeing us bear from them, they concluded of Victory: But our Captain Commanding his other Pin|nace to be brought a head of him, and to let fall their Grappers each a head the others, environed both the Pinnaces as for a clo&s;e fight. We (as well as they) &s;pent Powder apace, but had but one of out men wound|ed; what they had we knew not, but their Pinnaces were &s;hot through in diver&s;e places and the Powder of one of them took fire; whereupon we bore towards them, which they &s;eeing, betook them&s;elves to their old Sanctuary.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 3. Thus &s;eeing little hopes off &s;uc|ce&s;s in this place, our Captain thought it be&s;t to go Ea&s;tward towards <HI>Rio Grand</HI> to fur|ni&s;h our &s;elves with Victuals, being now &s;carce of them, and 2 days after we came to the Villages of &s;tore, where before we had furni&s;hed our &s;elves &s;ufficiently, but now found nothing, to our great grief; the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> having cau&s;ed the People to fly to the
<PB N="26" REF="17">
Mountains, and driven away their Cattel that we might not be relieved; afterwards we &s;aw a Frigate at Sea, and made quickly towards her, hoping to be relieved thence, but when we had boarded her we found &s;he had neither Meat, nor Money.</P>
<P>Thus we endured &s;carcity for 7 or 8 days, bearing room for <HI>Santa Martha</HI> in hopes to find Shipping there, and finding none we Anchored under the We&s;tern point; which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having notice of, conveyed 30 or 40 &s;hot among the Clifts, which &s;o annoyed us that we were forced to be gone with all &s;peed. Then we entred into con|&s;ultation what to do, the Company being for landing &s;omewhere Ea&s;tward to get Victu|als; But our Captain thought it better to bear towards <HI>Rio de Haca</HI> or <HI>Carizao.</HI></P>
<P>The Company of the other Pinnace an|&s;wered, that neither their Pinnaces could hold out, nor they them&s;elves &s;ub&s;i&s;t with &s;o &s;lender provi&s;ion. He an&s;wered they had more than he had, and therefore doubted not but they would tru&s;t providence. And &s;o he hoy&s;ed his fore-Sail and &s;et for <HI>Carizao,</HI> which they perceiving followed him.</P>
<P>As we had Sailed 3 Leagues we e&s;pied a Sail plying We&s;tward, and &s;o joyfully bare towards her; &s;he, being a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship above 90 Tun, &s;hot her Ordinance at us. We dur&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="17">
not attempt boarding her, it being Stormy, but attended her, and 2 hours after it being Calm, we boarded her, and furni&s;hed our &s;elves &s;ufficiently with Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>All things &s;et in order, &amp; the Wind ari&s;ing, we plyed off and on all night; when it was day the Captain &s;ent <HI>Edward Hixom</HI> to &s;earch out a good Harbor, who having found one re|turned, and we came in with our new Prize: Our Captain promi&s;ing liberty and all their Apparel to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> if they would procure us fre&s;h Water and Victuals, which they did; and towards the evening we came all aboard again leaving, our late Pri&s;oners, the <HI>Span|iards</HI> a&s;hore according to our promi&s;e to their great joy, and &s;o &s;et Sail.</P>
<P>At this time a &s;ickne&s;s raged among us, and <HI>Charles Club</HI> one of our Quarter-ma&s;ters died of it to our great grief: we impured it to cold, men had taken lying in the Pinnaces. But however it plea&s;ed God, that all the re&s;t of our Company recovered.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 15. Next morning our Captain com|manded the <HI>Minion,</HI> his le&s;&s;er Pinnace, to ha&s;ten before him toward his Ships at Fort <HI>Die|go</HI> within the <HI>Cabeza</HI>'s, to acquaint them of his coming, and prepare all things for our Land Journey, if &s;o be they heard any thing from the <HI>Symerons</HI> of the Fleets arrival.</P>

<P>When we came to the place we intended to lodge at, the <HI>Symerons</HI> laid a&s;ide their Burthens, to cut down Poles and <HI>Palmito</HI> Boughs or <HI>Plantain</HI> leaves, and with &s;peed &s;et up &s;ix Hou&s;es; fir&s;t fa&s;tning 3 or 4 great Po&s;ts with Forks, deep into the ground, up|on them they laid one Tran&s;ome (about 20 foot) making the &s;ides like the roofs of our Country Hou&s;es, Thatching it clo&s;e with the afore&s;aid Leaves, &s;o that it would keep out rain a long time.</P>
<P>We found near the Rivers &s;everal Fruits, as <HI>Mammeas, Guyavas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Limons,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>3d.</HI> day of our Journey they brought us to a Town of their own, &s;ituate upon the &s;ide of a Hill near a River, encompa&s;&s;ed with a Dike 8 foot broad, and a thick mud Wall 10 foot high. It had one long and broad Street from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and two cro&s;s Streets narrower; there were in it fifty or &s;ixty hou&s;eholds, which were &s;o cleanly, (that not only the Hou&s;es, but Streets were plea|&s;ant. Their Apparel is &s;omewhat after the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion. This Town is di&s;tant from <HI>Nom|bre de Dios</HI> 35 Leagues, and 45 from <HI>Panama,</HI>

it is &s;ufficiently &s;tored with Bea&s;ts, Fowls and &s;everal Fruits.</P>
<P>As for their Religion, they have no kind of Prie&s;ts, only they hold the Cro&s;s in great reputation: but at our Captains per&s;ua|&s;ion they were contented to leave their Cro&s;&s;es and learn the Lords Prayer, and be in&s;truct|ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure in Gods True Wor&s;hip. They keep a continual watch in 4 parts with|in 3 miles of the Town, for fear of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> who &s;ometimes by the Conduct of &s;ome <HI>Symerons,</HI> Captives to them, have come in upon them.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed there all night, during which time they related unto us &s;everal Broils be|twixt them and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> particularly one: A Gentleman entertained by the Go|vernor of the Country undertook la&s;t year, with 150 Souldiers to put them, Young, and Old to the Sword, being conducted by one of them that had been taken Pri&s;oner; he &s;ur|prized it half an hour before day, whereby many of the Men e&s;caped, but many Wo|men and Children were killed: but the &s;ame morning by Sun ri&s;ing (their guide being &s;lain) the <HI>Symerons</HI> a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves and behaved in &s;uch &s;ort, that they drove the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> to &s;uch extremity, that partly by the di&s;advantage of the Woods, having lo&s;t their guide, and partly by famine, not above 30

<P>Our Captain was kindly entreated by them all, and was de&s;ired to abide with them &s;ome time, but he being intent on his Journey, thankt them for their kindne&s;s, and march|ed on in his intended Journey.</P>
<P>The order of our March was thus; Four of the <HI>Symerons</HI> as knew the way be&s;t went a mile before us, breaking off Boughs of Trees and throwing them on the way for a direction to tho&s;e that followed, 12 of them were our Vantguard, and 12 our Rereward, we in the middle.</P>
<P>Our way through Woods by rea&s;on of the &s;hade was cooler than it is in mo&s;t parts in <HI>England,</HI> in the Summer time.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 11. We came to a High Hill, mid|way where was a great Tree whence we might &s;ee both the North and South <HI>Atlan|tick</HI> Ocean; one of the <HI>Symerons</HI> took our Captain by the hand and led him up thither who likewi&s;e called us up to it. The Tree was cut, and &s;everal &s;teps made in it to a&s;|cend; near unto the top was made a con|venient Bower, wherein 10 or 12 Men might ea&s;ily &s;it.</P>

Being throughly &s;atisfied with the &s;ight, we de&s;cended, and continued our former Jour|ney; when we came to the Champion Coun|try we found the Gra&s;s of an extraordinary height. The Inhabitants are forced to burn it thrice a year that their Cattel may feed on it; after which it &s;prings up fre&s;h in 3 days; Its &s;talks are as big as a Wheaten reed, and though Cattle feed on it, yet in a few days it grows &s;o high that they cannot reach it.</P>
<P>After we were come within a days Journey of <HI>Panama,</HI> for fear of being di&s;covered, we went out of the ordinary way, and came to a Grove within a League of <HI>Panama;</HI> thence we &s;ent a <HI>Symeron</HI> who had been formerly at <HI>Panama,</HI> in habit of a <HI>Negroe,</HI> to learn on what night (for they travel from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> by night, by rea&s;on they have no &s;hades there, but from thence to <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> by day, for that the Country there a|bounds in Woods) they were to carry their Trea&s;ure to <HI>Nombre de Dios;</HI> who returning certified us that the Trea&s;urer of <HI>Lima</HI> was to go that night with 8 Moyles laden with Gold, and one with Jewels. And further, that there were 2 <HI>Recoes,</HI> 50 Moyles in each, la|den mo&s;tly with Victuals, with &s;ome little quantity of Silver, to come forth that night af|ter the other. Hereupon we marched till we

came within 2 Leagues of <HI>Venta Cruz;</HI> two of our <HI>Symerons</HI> &s;ent before, found a <HI>Spani|ard,</HI> whom they brought to us; who exa|mining him were confirmed of the truth of that our Spy had told us. This Souldier having learned who our Captain was, prayed him to pre&s;erve him from the fury of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> and that &s;eeing he was a Souldier, and a&s;&s;ured him of more Gold that night than they could di&s;po&s;e of, be&s;ides Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That he would plea&s;e to let him have &s;o much as might &s;uffice him and his Mi&s;tre&s;s to live upon.</P>
<P>Being at the place appointed, our Captain with half his men lay on one &s;ide of the way about 50 paces off in the long Gra&s;s; <HI>John Oxnam</HI> with the Captain of the <HI>Symerons</HI> and other half on the other &s;ide of the way, the like di&s;tance; but &s;o far di&s;tant that by that time the one Company could &s;eize on the foremo&s;t Moyles, the other might take the hindmo&s;t, and likeways that if we &s;hould have any Skirmi&s;h that night, we might not endamage our own men. We had not lain thus, much above an hour, when we heard the <HI>Recoes</HI> coming, and going betwixt <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Venta Cruz.</HI> And though &s;trict charge was given that none of our men &s;hould &s;tir as any pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> as know|ing they had nothing but Merchandi&s;e; yet
<PB N="36" REF="22">
<HI>Robert Pike,</HI> one of our men forgot him&s;elf and enti&s;ing a <HI>Symeron</HI> with him, went hard by the way &s;ide, and a Cavalier from <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> coming by, &s;tood up to &s;ee what he was, and though the <HI>Symeron</HI> pull'd him down again, yet the Gentleman took notice of him, &s;eeing one all in White, (for we had put our &s;hirts over our Cloaths that if we &s;hould happen to Skirmi&s;h with them we might know our own men in the night) and pre&s;ently put &s;purs to his Hor&s;e. This al|teration of his Hor&s;es pace was ob&s;erved by our Captain, who therefore &s;u&s;pected we were di&s;covered, but could not imagine by who&s;e fault. Yet &s;uppo&s;ing it might be by rea&s;on of the danger of the Place, we lay &s;till in expectation of their coming, who by this time were within half a League of us, and had come, but that this Gentleman meeting them reported what he had &s;een, and per&s;uaded the Trea&s;urer it was either Captain <HI>Drake,</HI> or &s;ome from him, who, ha|ving been fru&s;trate of their hopes of Trea|&s;ure from <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> were re&s;olved to have it here, and thereupon he prevailed with him to turn his <HI>Recoe</HI> out of the way, and to let the other <HI>Recoes</HI> which were laded mo&s;tly with Victuals to pa&s;s on, in regard the lo&s;s of them would not be con&s;iderable. Thus were we di&s;appointed of a mo&s;t rich booty.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="22">
The other two <HI>Recoes</HI> coming up we &s;ei|zed upon them. One of their chief Car|riers told our Captain how we were di&s;co|vered, and withal advi&s;ed us to &s;hift for our &s;elves betimes. Whereupon <HI>Pedro,</HI> the Chief of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> told us that there were but two ways for e&s;cape, either to Travel back the &s;ame &s;ecret way we came, for four Leagues, into the Woods; or el&s;e to make a way through <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> by our Swords; The latter of which notwith&s;tanding the dangerou&s;ne&s;s of it, our Captain cho&s;e, as being the &s;horte&s;t way. Therefore command|ing all to refre&s;h them&s;elves, he told them his re&s;olution, asking <HI>Pedro</HI> if he would give him his hand, not to for&s;ake him, which he willingly did, vowing that he would rather dye at his Feet than leave him to the Ene|mies Fury, if he held this cour&s;e. Thus we took our Journey to <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> with help of the Moyls, till we came within a Mile of the Town, where we turned away the <HI>Recoes,</HI> charging their Conductors not to follow us. There the way is cut through the Wood, &s;o as two <HI>Recoes</HI> may pa&s;s by one another. For tho&s;e Woods grow as thick as our thicke&s;t Hedges in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>A Company of Soldiers came out again&s;t us to the middle of this Wood, with whom a Convent of Fryers joyned; Our Captain
<PB N="38" REF="23">
informed of their coming, by two <HI>Symerons</HI> &s;ent before, gave charge that none of us &s;hould &s;hoot till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had fir&s;t Fired. When they came up, their Captain charged ours to yield our &s;elves Pri&s;oners, which our Captain refu&s;ing, they immediately Fired, doing us no con&s;iderable hurt, &s;ave only <HI>John Harris</HI> one of our Company was kil|led. But our Captain perceiving their Shot &s;lacking, gave us a Sign to di&s;charge upon them, and then march or wards with in|tent to clo&s;e with them. They retired to a place of greater &s;trength, and we ha&s;ten|ed our pace to prevent it. Which the <HI>Syme|rons</HI> perceiving (though frighted with the Shot they had &s;tept a&s;ide) ru&s;hed forwards with their Arrows ready in their Bows, leap|ing and dancing, and &s;inging <HI>Y&oacute; peh&oacute;, y&oacute; pe|h&oacute;,</HI> and &s;o continued till we overtook &s;ome of the Enemy, who conveyed them&s;elves within the Woods to have taken their &s;tand at us. But our <HI>Symerons</HI> brake in through the thicke&s;t of them, forcing them to flye; diver&s;e of our men were Wounded and one <HI>Symeron</HI> killed, who yet revenged his own death before he died.</P>
<P>Thus we entred the Town, being about 40 or 50 Hou&s;es, having both a Governor and other Officers, and &s;ome fair Hou&s;es, with &s;ome Store-hou&s;es, be&s;ides he Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="23">
We found here 3 Gentlewomen lately de|livered of Children who were come hither from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to bring forth their Children; becau&s;e it hath been ob&s;erved that no <HI>Spaniard,</HI> or White, could ever be delivered at <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> but the Chil|dren died within 3 days; yet being brought up here or in <HI>Panama</HI> 5 or 6 years, and then brought to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> if they e&s;cap't &s;ick|ne&s;s &s;ix weeks they lived as healthy as any where. The&s;e Gentlewomen at our fir&s;t coming were in great fear, yet, our Captain having charged the <HI>Symerons</HI> to hurt none &s;ave tho&s;e that were Armed, they received no harm. Having &s;et our Guards on all pa&s;&s;ages to prevent danger, we &s;tayed in this Town an hour and a half refre&s;hing our &s;elves, and our Company and the <HI>Symerons</HI> had got &s;ome Pillage. A little before we departed 12 Hor&s;emen come from <HI>Panama,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing we had been gone, entred the Town, but were forced quickly to retire.</P>
<P>Thus having di&s;patcht our bu&s;ine&s;s in this Town we marched over the Bridge, ob|&s;erving the &s;ame order as formerly, and our Captain longing to be at his Ships ha&s;tned his Journey as much as po&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on whereof we marched with hungry Stomachs.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="24">
In our ab&s;ence the <HI>Symerons</HI> we left with our men had built a little Town 3 Leagues off where our Ship lay, where our Captain at their entreaty made &s;ome &s;tay, and &s;up|plied us with Shoes, which had been wore out in our Journey.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Symerons</HI> were very &s;erviceable to us, being to us guides, Intelligencers, Pur|veyors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when any of our men was wearied, two of them would take him up and carry him 2 miles together, and like|wi&s;e &s;hewed them&s;elves very Valiant.</P>
<P>At our fir&s;t entrance into this Town our Captain di&s;patcht a <HI>Symeron</HI> with an order and token to the Ma&s;ter of our Ship, who being come was quickly &s;et aboard; and &s;hewing a Tooth-Pike of Gold, which he &s;aid our Captain had &s;ent for a token to <HI>Ed|ward Hixom</HI> with charge to meet him at &s;uch a River, tho the Ma&s;ter knew it was the Captains, yet by rea&s;on of his former order he demurred, which the <HI>Symeron</HI> per|ceiving, told him, that becau&s;e it was night when he was &s;ent, our Captain could not &s;end a Letter, but with the point of his Knife wrote upon the Tooth-Pike; where|upon the Ma&s;ter looking upon it, read it, and being confirmed of the truth of it, prepa|red accordingly, and repaired to the mouth of the River of <HI>Tortugos,</HI> where we met to our
<PB N="41" REF="24">
mutual rejoycing. We &s;eemed to tho&s;e who had been at re&s;t aboard, &s;trangely meta|morpho&s;ed, which might probably be through our long Fa&s;ting and Travel, but our inward grief for being fru&s;trate of our de&s;ign, was no doubt the main cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus returned from <HI>Panama,</HI> our Cap|tain purpo&s;ing further to attempt the &s;ame Journey, he would not &s;uffer the edge of his men to be rebated. And therefore ha|ving a de&s;ign to attempt in &s;ome other places, and particularly <HI>Veragua,</HI> a rich Town lying between <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua</HI> where is the Riche&s;t Mine of Gold on this North &s;ide, he asked his Company their opi|nions. Some thought it be&s;t to procure more Victuals, that we might keep clo&s;e till a convenient time, which might ea&s;ily be done, &s;eeing the Victual Frigates were not well Defended, whereas the Trea&s;ure Fri|gats were well Manned. Others were for intercepting Frigats laden with Trea&s;ure, both becau&s;e we had &s;tore of Victuals, and that they might be had at any time, where|as Trea&s;ure was only to be found when the Fleet is there, which was now. The <HI>Symerons</HI> being askt their opinion, declared that near <HI>Veragua Sinnior Pezoro</HI> (their Ma|&s;ter, from whom they had fled) had dwelt in a &s;trong Store hou&s;e, above 19
<PB N="42" REF="25">
years, who &s;eldom went abroad; and that he keeps 100 Slaves in the Mines (each be|ing obliged to bring in daily of gain 3 <HI>Pe|zoes</HI> of Gold for him&s;elf, and two for his Women (8 s. 3 d. the <HI>Pezoe)</HI> whereby he had gathered a va&s;t Trea&s;ure, being cruel and covetous, and never went abroad with 5 or 6 men in his Guard, although he was always in fear. And that if our Captain were &s;o re&s;olved they would &s;o conduct him thither as he &s;hould not be de&s;cried, but might &s;urprize them, and that although his Hou&s;e were very &s;trong yet they could ea&s;i|ly procure him acce&s;s to his Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Our Captain having heard all their opi|nions, concluded to reconcile the 2 fir&s;t opinions, and therefore &s;ent <HI>John Oxnam</HI> Ea&s;twards to provide for Victuals, he him|&s;elf re&s;olving to go We&s;twards in the <HI>Minion,</HI> to lye off and on the <HI>Cabezas</HI> to attend the Frigats that tran&s;ported the Trea&s;ure: But di&s;liked the <HI>Symerons</HI> propo&s;al, le&s;t our men might thereby be wearied, whom he de&s;ign|ed to &s;trengthen for his next &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Therefore he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed &s;uch of the <HI>Sy|merons</HI> as were de&s;irous to go, with &s;uch gifts as were mo&s;t plea&s;ing, entertaining &s;till aboard tho&s;e that were willing to &s;tay, and &s;o they &s;teered their cour&s;e as is &s;aid.</P>

The <HI>Minion</HI> about the <HI>Cabexas</HI> met with a Frigate of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> in which was &s;ome Gold, having a <HI>Genoway</HI> Pilot, who being ci|villy u&s;ed, certified our Captain of the &s;tate of the Town, and Harbor, and of a Fri|gate wherein was a Million of Gold, ready to depart in a few days, offering to conduct him to it, if he would do him his right, for that he know the Channel &s;o well that he could enter &s;afely by night, and utterly unde&s;cried, and that becau&s;e the way by Land from the point is far and difficult, and by Sea but 5 Leagues, though we were di&s;|covered, we might di&s;patch our bu&s;ine&s;s be|fore the Town could have notice. He like|wi&s;e told he heard of <HI>Drakes</HI> being on the Coa&s;t, whereby they were greatly afraid, but had not as yet provided them&s;elves a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>Our Captain hearing this, had a mind to return to his Ship, to have been better in|formed of the place by &s;ome <HI>Symerons</HI> there; But the <HI>Genoway</HI> urged to lo&s;e no time, promi&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s if we delayed not, and therefore our Captain following his ad|vice, &s;et in for to enter the Harbor.</P>
<P>But when we came to the mouth of it, we heard a report of 2 Chambers, and a|bout a League off, 2 An&s;wering them, where|by our <HI>Genoway</HI> &s;u&s;pected we were di&s;co|vered,

a&s;&s;uring us that this order was taken &s;ince his departure.</P>
<P>But not only this, but providence like|wi&s;e cro&s;&s;ed our de&s;igns. For the wind that formerly was Ea&s;terly turned to the We&s;t; whereupon we returned to our Ship, where on <HI>Sheer Thur&s;day</HI> we met according to appointment with our <HI>Bear,</HI> who had em|proved his time better than we, having taken a Frigate wherein were 10 men, great &s;tore of <HI>Maiz,</HI> 28 fat Hogs, and 200 Hens. Our Captain unladed her and made her up for a Man of War, having heard by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they were building 2 little Gallies in <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to waft the <HI>Cha|gro</HI> Fleet to and fro, but not yet lanched, Wherefore he purpo&s;ed to take that Fleet, and, to encourage his Company, fea&s;ted them &s;umptuou&s;ly that <HI>Ea&s;terday</HI> being <HI>Mar.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>The next day with this new Frigat and <HI>Bear</HI> we &s;et for <HI>Cativaas,</HI> and landed 2 days after, &s;taying till noon, when &s;eeing a Sail to the We&s;tward, we plyed towards her, and &s;he bare with us till they &s;aw we were no <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and their Catain &s;uppo&s;ing us tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men he had heard of he made towards us.</P>

nothing but Wine and Sider aboard, which had greatly empaired the health of his men. Our Captain &s;ent him &s;ome relief for the pre|&s;ent, willing him to follow us to the next Port where he &s;hould be better &s;upplyed. He &s;ent our Captain a Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tols and a guilt Symeter (which had been the late K. of <HI>France</HI>'s whom <HI>Mon&s;.

<P>This Captain reported to us the fir&s;t news of the Ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Paris</HI> at the K. of <HI>Na|varres</HI> Marriage on St. <HI>Bartholomews</HI> Day la&s;t, of the Admiral of <HI>France</HI> &s;lain in his Chamber, and divers others of the Popi&s;h Cruelties. He told what famous reports he had heard of us; and he de&s;ired to know of our Captain what way he might compa&s;s his Voyage. Tho' our Captain was jealous of him, yet upon con&s;ultation he re&s;olved to take him and divide his men and put them with ours proportionably, &s;o as we needed not fear much hurt of them, &s;o that we might both gratifie them and &s;erve our own turn. Having thus agreed with him we &s;ent for the <HI>Symerons;</HI> two of them were brought aboard our Ship, to give the <HI>French</HI> a&s;&s;urance of this agree|ment.</P>

As &s;oon as we had furni&s;ht our &s;elves and re|fre&s;ht the <HI>French,</HI> which was done in five or &s;ix days, taking twenty of the <HI>French</HI> and fif|teen of ours, with our <HI>Symerons,</HI> and leaving both our Ships in &s;afe Road, we man'd our Frigat and two Pinnaces, and went toward <HI>Rio Franci&s;co,</HI> and becau&s;e it had not Water enough for our Frigat we left her at the <HI>Ca|bezas,</HI> man'd with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> to <HI>Robert Doble,</HI> to &s;tay there till our Pinnaces return'd; and then bare to <HI>Rio Franci&s;co,</HI> where our Captains landed, and ordered them, that had the Charge of the Pinnaces, to be there the fourth day following.</P>
<P>And thus knowing that the Carriages went now daily from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> we went &s;ecretly through the Woods, towards the High-way, betwixt them; it is reckoned five Leagues by Sea but the way we went was &s;even. When we were come within an Engli&s;h Mile of the way, we pa&s;t the night in great &s;ilence, in a convenient place, where we heard the Car|penters working in their Ships, as they u&s;u|ally do by rea&s;on of the heat of the day there. The next morning upon hearing the great number of Bells, the <HI>Symerons</HI> rejoyced, as having that opportunity again, of which we were di&s;appointed before; now they a&s;&s;u|red us we &s;hould have more Gold than we

could bear away, as in truth it fell out: For there came three <HI>Recoes,</HI> one of fifty Moyls; the other two of &s;eventy each, which carri|ed in all near thirty Tun of Silver. We put our &s;elves in readine&s;s, and went down near the way, where we &s;tayed not long till we &s;aw them, and took &s;uch hold on the fore|mo&s;t and hindermo&s;t Moyls, that all the re&s;t &s;tayed and unladed, as their manner is.</P>
<P>They were guarded with about forty five Soldiers, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;mall Skir|mi&s;h, in which Conflict the <HI>French</HI> Captain was dangerou&s;ly wounded, and one <HI>Symeron;</HI> but in the end we put them to flight, and then we unladed the Moyls. And being weary we were content to take a little with us as we could ea&s;ily carry, hiding the re&s;t in convenient places.</P>
<P>But when we had di&s;po&s;ed of all our matters (being about two hours) and were ready to march back, we heard both Hor&s;e and Foot coming, as it &s;eemed to the Moyls, for they did not follow us, after we entred the Woods; and the <HI>French</HI> Captain di&s;a|bled by rea&s;on of his Wounds &s;tayed, ho|ping thereby to recover his &s;trength.

Notwith&s;tanding this, our Men went to the place, and for all the narrow &s;earch that was made, brought back to our Frigate 13 Bars of Silver, and &s;ome Quoits of Gold. Now we purpo&s;ed to go homewards, and our Captain in order there|unto de&s;igned to look for a &s;ufficient Ship to carry &s;o much Victuals as might &s;erve for our Voyage.</P>

<P>Being ready to depart we burnt our Pin|naces, that the <HI>Symerons</HI> might have the Iron work; and our Captain de&s;ired <HI>Pedro</HI> with &s;ome others of them, to take what they had a mind to in the Ship, promi&s;ing to with-hold nothing from them, without which we could &s;ub&s;i&s;t in our Voyage, and that he would look out &s;ome Silks and Linnen for their Wives; which while he was choo&s;ing out of his Trunks, <HI>Pedro</HI> e&s;pyed the <HI>Cymeter</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Captain had given him, and had a great mind to it, and being loth to ask our Captain for it him&s;elf, he de&s;ired another to do it for him, promi&s;ing him a Quoit of Gold for his pains, and that he would give our Captain 4 other great Quoits. Our Captain being accordingly moved for it, though un|willing to part with it, yet willing to gratifie him that had de&s;erved &s;o well, gave it him. He was exceedingly rejoyced hereat, declar|ing,

<P>The&s;e Ships he Mann'd with 164 able Men, and furni&s;hed them with all nece&s;&s;aries, not forgetting ornaments and delights, ha|ving with him &s;everal expert Mu&s;icians; he likewi&s;e made &s;ome Pinnaces, but carried aboard in pieces for to be &s;et up when occa|&s;ion &s;erved. Thus furni&s;hed, we &s;et Sail from <HI>Plimouth, Nov.</HI> 15. 1557. at 5 a Clock in the Afternoon; but meeting with contrary Wind we were forced to put in at <HI>Falmouth.</HI> The next day there aro&s;e &s;uch a Storm, that the Admiral and <HI>Marigold</HI> were fain to cut their main Ma&s;t: And therefore when the Storm was over we returned to <HI>Plimouth</HI> to repair our damages; which done we put to Sea again, <HI>Dec.</HI> 13. When we were out of &s;ight of Land we ea&s;ily conjectured whither our General intended, by his cour&s;e, and his appointing <HI>Mogadore</HI> our place of meeting if any of our Ships &s;hould be parted from the Fleet. The fir&s;t Land we had &s;ight of, was <HI>Cape Cantine</HI> in <HI>Barbary</HI> on <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day</HI> in the Morning. The &s;hore is White &s;and, the In-land mountainous, in 32 deg. 30 min.

At the South &s;ide of it are 3 hollow Rocks, under which are &s;tore of whole&s;om, but ugly Fi&s;h. We &s;ent a Boat to &s;ound the Harbor, and finding it &s;afe, we brought in our Ships, <HI>Dec.</HI> 27. and continued there till the end of the Month, &s;etting up one of our Pinnaces. The Inha|bitants perceiving us, gave us &s;igns of their de&s;ire to be brought aboard, to whom our General &s;ent a Boat, in which two of the <HI>Moors</HI> were received, one of ours being left a&s;hore as a Pledge.</P>
<P>We entertained them very courteou&s;ly that they might thereby under&s;tand that we came in peace, offering to traffick for their Coun|try commodities. To this they agreed, pro|mi&s;ing, to bring &s;uch things as they had to exchange for ours. It is a Law among them to drink no Wine, notwith&s;tanding privately they ta&s;te it liberally, as we found. At their return they re&s;tored our Pledge. The next day they brought with them Camels in &s;hew loaden with Wares; and therefore according to order (our General being then a&s;hore in the I&s;land) we &s;hut off a Boat. Our Boat being come to Land, <HI>John Fry</HI> one of our men

mi&s;tru&s;ting no danger, &s;tept out of the Boat, but was pre&s;ently laid hold of, and carried away.

<P>Here, being a plentiful place, our General purpo&s;ed to &s;tay a while to refre&s;h his men. During our aboad he was vi&s;ited by the Peo|ple of the Country, who brought down a Woman a <HI>Moor,</HI> with an Infant hanging by her dry dug, having &s;carce life in her, to be &s;old as a Cow and Calf, but our General would not deal in &s;uch goods. They al&s;o brought Ambergreece and Gums to exchange for Water, of which they are very &s;carce; our General gave them Water, but would take nothing for it, as al&s;o &s;ome of our Victuals; their manner of eating whereof was In|human.</P>
<P>Having trimmed our Ships and di&s;charg|ed the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;ave one we took with us, we departed for the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape de Ver|de,</HI> intending there to take in Water, for that from thence we intended &s;traight for <HI>Bra|zil</HI> without touching Land.

Landing here we found a great many rui|nous Hou&s;es with a poor naked Chappel.

In this Journey we found the &s;oil very fruitful, full of Fig-Trees, and in the Valleys, where their Cottages were, Vineyards bearing ripe Grapes, tho now in Winter, (the Sun &s;carce ever withdrawing him&s;elf from them.) There were al&s;o <HI>Coco</HI> Trees, no branches &s;prouting forth but at the Top, with &s;everal others.

<P>This I&s;land hath great &s;tore of Goats, Hens, and Salt made Naturally by the Suns heat, &s;o that of the product thereof, they keep continual Traffick with the adjacent I&s;lands.

<P>On the South-we&s;t of this I&s;land, we took a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> laden with Wine, Wollen and Linnen Cloath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bound for <HI>Brazil.</HI></P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ight of 3 of their Towns, they &s;hot off 3 great Pieces, which we an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Twelve Leagues South of St. <HI>Jago</HI> lies that I&s;land called by the <HI>Portugue&s;e Fogo,</HI> the Burning I&s;land, in which ri&s;eth a &s;teep Hill 6 Leagues high, within the bowels of which is a con&s;tant fire, which breaketh out with violence 4 times an hour. Herein is engendered a great quantity of Pumice &s;tones, which being by the Vehemency of the Fire, carried up into the Air, fall down upon the Hill, and many times into the Sea. The re&s;t of the I&s;land is fruitful, and Inha|bited by <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P>Two Leagues to the South of this I&s;land, lies a plea&s;ant I&s;land, full of Trees, which are always green, whence it is cal|led the <HI>Brave I&s;land,</HI> being a Storehou&s;e of many Fruits, as Figs, Coco's Plantons, Oranges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> full of plea&s;ant &s;treams of

Water: But there is no convenient Road for Ships. For after long &s;ounding, we could find no ground at any hand, neither was it ever known that any line would fetch ground in any place about the I&s;land. So that the Top of <HI>Fogo,</HI> burneth not &s;o high in the Air, but that the root of <HI>Brava</HI> is buried as low in the Seas. The only Inhabi|tant of this I&s;land is an Hermite, as we &s;up|po&s;e, for we &s;aw but one Hou&s;e, built as it &s;eems for &s;uch purpo&s;e; and he was &s;o de|lighted in his &s;olitary life, that he would by no means abide our coming, but fled, leav|ing behind him a Cro&s;s with a Crucifix, and &s;uch other Idolatrous tra&s;h.</P>
<P>Here we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the <HI>Portugals,</HI> taken at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and gave them for their Ship our new Pinnace, with Provi&s;ion to carry them home.</P>
<P>Having thus taken in fre&s;h Water, we departed, <HI>Feb.</HI> 2. and fell with the Coa&s;t of <HI>Brazil, Apr.</HI> 5. 1578. during which Voy|age, where we &s;aw nothing but Sea and Air; as we beheld the wonderful Works of God in his creatures, &s;o likewi&s;e we did ta&s;t the goodne&s;s thereof, for relief of our ne|ce&s;&s;ities. We often had adver&s;e Winds, and &s;ometimes Calms, and al&s;o terrible Light|nings and Thunder, yet with a mixture of comforts; for it plea&s;ed God that (whereas
<PB N="63" REF="35">
we were but badly furni&s;hed with Water) when we were within 4 degrees of the Line on this &s;ide, and pa&s;t it &s;o many on the other, we had every day &s;ome rain, whereby our want of Water was much &s;upplied. This was al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that notwith&s;tanding the badne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age, and Storms we &s;ome|times had, yet not one of us lo&s;t our com|pany &s;ave only the <HI>Portugal</HI> prize for one day, but next day found us again.</P>
<P>Among the many &s;trange creatures we &s;aw, we took particular notice of a flying Fi&s;h, as big as the ordinary Pilchards, its fins are of the length of its whole body, re&s;emb|ling and &s;upplying the u&s;e of Wings; for therewith, when it is cha&s;ed by bigger Fi&s;h, and cannot e&s;cape by Swimming, it lifteth it &s;elf above the Water, and flyeth a pret|ty height, &s;ometimes lighting on Boats or Barks: The Quils thereof are proportiona|ble, &s;et together, with a thin Film, &s;o that they would &s;erve for a longer or higher flight, but that the dryne&s;s of them is &s;uch, that unle&s;s moi&s;tned every 10 or 12 &s;trokes, they grow &s;tiff and unfit for motion. The encrea&s;e of this Creature is wonderful, which if it had not been &s;o, their kind could not have been continued, they being a prey to &s;o many Creatures. And when they flee into the Air, in &s;hunning one hazard, they com|monly

incur another by &s;ome ravenous Foul.</P>
<P>When we came within 3 Leagues of <HI>Bra|zil,</HI> in 31 deg. 30 min. South latitude, ha|ving 12 Fathom Water, we were de&s;cried by the Inhabitants, and we &s;aw huge fires made by them in &s;everal places, which cu&s;tom though it be univer&s;al among Chri&s;tians and Heathens, yet is differently u&s;ed by them, to wit, for a &s;acrifice to Devils, with many other conjurations, ca&s;ting up heaps of &s;and, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that if any Ships &s;tay upon their Coa&s;t, their mini&s;tring Spirits may make wrack of them, which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have found to their lo&s;s. But this devili&s;h intent of theirs was of no effect to us, for though we had great Storms, yet we &s;u&s;tained no da|mage but the &s;eparating our Ships. And &s;eeing we could find no Harbor thereabout we coa&s;ted along Southward, till <HI>April</HI> 14 in the morning we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Mary</HI> in 35 deg. near the mouth of the River <HI>Plate,</HI> and running within it 6 or 7 Lea|gues we came to Anchor under another <HI>Cape</HI> which our General after called <HI>Cape Joy,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;econd day after our An|choring here, the <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> we had lo&s;t in the former &s;torm, came to us again. The cares our General took be&s;ides the main care of effecting our Voyage, were
<PB N="65" REF="36">
the&s;e; to keep our whole Fleet together; to get fre&s;h Water for our men; and to re|fre&s;h them when wearied. And therefore at our departure from <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> the next place of meeting, if we &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed, or for Watering, was appointed to be the River of <HI>Plate.</HI></P>
<P>The Country thereabout is temperate, of a &s;weet Air, and fruitful &s;oyl: and hath a|mong other things, plenty of large Deer.</P>
<P>We removed hence 12 Leagues further, where was a long trace of Rocks, not far from the Main, making a commodious Har|bor, e&s;pecially again&s;t the South-wind, and rode till the <HI>20th</HI> day, where we killed &s;tore of Seals. We weighed again hence and &s;ail|ed further up the River till we had but 3 Fathom, and were in fre&s;h Water, but becau&s;e the Winds were &s;trong, and we could have no &s;afe Harbor there, we went to Sea a|gain, <HI>Apr.</HI> 27. The Land here lieth, S. S. W. and N. N. E. with &s;hoal water &s;ome 3 or 4 Leagues off into the Sea; it's in 36 deg. 20 min. or better, South. Latitude.</P>
<P>At our coming to Sea the <HI>Swan</HI> lo&s;t com|pany of us. And therefore our General to pre|vent the like in tho&s;e that remained, knowing that the Coa&s;t (it drawing now toward Win|ter) u&s;es to be &s;ubject to tempe&s;tuous wea|ther, determined to &s;eek out &s;ome conveni|ent

Harbor, and &s;earched all that Coa&s;t from 36 to 47 deg. but found none. And <HI>May</HI> 8. by another Storm the <HI>Caunter</HI> was &s;evered from us. <HI>May</HI> 12 we &s;aw Land in 47 deg. where we came to Anchor in &s;uch Road as we could for the time. Our Ge|neral named the place <HI>Cape Hope,</HI> by rea|&s;on of a Bay within, which promi&s;ed a con|venient Harbor. But by rea&s;on of the ma|ny Rocks lying off it, we dur&s;t not hazard our Ships into it, without trial fir&s;t made.</P>
<P>Our General (who never was wont in matters of importance to tru&s;t to other mens care) went him&s;elf with &s;ome others in a Boat, <HI>May</HI> 13. to &s;ound it out: and being now nigh the Shore, &s;uddenly a thick fog aro&s;e with a great tempe&s;t; our General thought it now be&s;t to return to his Ship but the fog was &s;o thick that, they could &s;ee none of us. Captain <HI>Thomas</HI> out of love to our General, hazarded in with his Ship, where he found him, and received him aboard, and then dropt an Anchor there, and lay &s;afe during the Storm, while we were to&s;|&s;ed at Sea. The next day the weather being fair, our General went a&s;hore, that he might by making of fires gave &s;igns to the di&s;per|&s;ed Ships to come together again, whereby at la&s;t they all met except the <HI>Swan</HI> and our <HI>Portugal</HI> prize, the <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="37">
In this place (the people being fled for fear of our coming) we found near the Rocks, in hou&s;es made for that purpo&s;e, 50 <HI>O&s;triches</HI> at lea&s;t, with other Foul, &s;ome dryed and &s;ome drying for their provi&s;ion. The <HI>Ostriches</HI> Thighs were as big as ordinary Legs of Mutton; they cannot flie, but run &s;o &s;wift|ly that a man cannot overtake them, nor come within &s;hot of them: we found the In&s;tru|ments the people u&s;e to take them with: Among others this is one; they have a large Plum of Feathers tyed together upon the end of a Staff, in the fore part re&s;embling the Head, Neck and Bulk of an <HI>O&s;trich;</HI> in the hinder part, &s;preading it &s;elf out &s;o large as to hide the Body of a man: with this they drive them into &s;ome neck of Land by the Sea, where &s;preading long Nets, with their Dogs, they overthrow them. The Coun|try is very plea&s;ant, and of a fruitful Soil. Being afterwards driven to this place again, we had great familiarity with the people, who rejoyeed at our return, becau&s;e we had done no hurt this time: But becau&s;e this place was not fit for our purpo&s;e we depart|ed <HI>May</HI> 15. and held our cour&s;e S. and by W. In 47 deg. 30 min. we found a Bay convenient for us, in which we Anchored <HI>May</HI> 17. and the next day went further in, where we abode 15 days.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="38">
The fir&s;t day of our arrival here, our General &s;ent Captain <HI>Winter</HI> Southward, he him&s;elf going to the North, in &s;earch of the 2 Ships, and it plea&s;ed God he met with the <HI>Swan,</HI> which he brought with him into the Harbor; where being unladen, &s;he was ca&s;t off, and her Iron work and other nece&s;&s;aries re&s;erved for u&s;e, the remainder being made fire-wood. The other Ship we could not as yet hear of.</P>
<P>After a little &s;tay here, &s;ome of our men being a&s;hore, in an I&s;land near the Main, the People of the Country &s;hewed them|&s;elves to us, with Leaping, Dancing, Shout|ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after their manner; Our General &s;ent a Boat &s;traight to them, with Knives, Bells, Bugles and &s;uch things, whereupon they a&s;&s;embled on a Hill near the Water-&s;ide &amp; &s;ent 2 of their Company, running one after the other with great grace, but when they drew near, they halted, refu&s;ing to come to our men; which our men perceiving &s;ent &s;uch things as they had, and laid them in their view, and as &s;oon as our men were departed they came and took them, leaving in exchange thereof Feathers, and Bone made in fa&s;hion of a Toothpike, carved about the top, 6 Inches long. Whereupon our General with divers others at low Wa|ter went over to the Main.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="38">
Again&s;t his coming they remained &s;till on the Hill &s;etting them&s;elves all in one Rank, ordaining one of them to run from one end of it to the other, and back again, Ea&s;t and We&s;t, holding his hands over his Head, and yielding forward his Body to|ward the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the Sun, and every 2d or 3d turn erecting it towards the body of the People after their ridiculous manner. When they &s;aw us a&s;cending the Hill to them, they &s;eem'd afraid. Which our General &s;eeing retired, whereby they were confirmed we had no de&s;ign to injure them, and came down with great &s;peed after us, and trafficked with us. The wares we had from them were Arrows of Reeds, Feathers, and Bones as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>They go Naked, except a Skin of Fur they ca&s;t about their &s;houlders, when they &s;it in the cold; but when they are doing any work, they gird it about their Loins. They wear their Hair long, and when they Tra|vel they put it up with a roll of <HI>O&s;trich</HI> Feathers, u&s;ing the&s;e rolls likewi&s;e for Qui|vers, and for carrying provi&s;ion, &s;ome on either &s;ide within the&s;e rolls (for a &s;ign of honor) have a large and plain Feather &s;hewing like horns a far off.</P>
<P>They paint their Bodies, with divers co|lours: &s;ome wa&s;h their Faces with Sulphur;
<PB N="70" REF="39">
&s;ome paint their whole Bodies black leaving only their Neck white; &s;ome one Shoulder black another white, and their Sides and Legs after the &s;ame manner, the black part hath &s;et upon it white Moons, and the white black Suns, the Marks and Characters of their Gods.</P>
<P>This advantage (I conceive) they have of painting their Bodies; that it Armeth them again&s;t the nipping cold, for the Co|lours being &s;oakt into the inner part of their skin, fills up the pores &s;o clo&s;e that no cold can enter. They have clean, comely and &s;trong Bodies, they are &s;wift of foot and Active.</P>
<P>It's &s;trange to think how they having ne|ver before known Chri&s;tians, in a &s;hort time were &s;o kind, judging us a People they ought to &s;erve, not injure, e&s;teeming our General as a Father, us as Brethren. One of the chiefe&s;t of them receiving a Cap of our Generals went a little from us, and pierced hie Leg with an Arrow till the Blood &s;treamed, hereby &s;ignifying his unfeigned Love. They were in all, that conver&s;ed with us, about 50.</P>
<P>In the Southermo&s;t part of this Bay there is a fre&s;h Water River wherein are a great many I&s;lands, of which &s;ome have &s;uch &s;tore of Seals as would mantain an Army of men:
<PB N="71" REF="39">
others are in like &s;ort repleni&s;hed with Foul. We could not perceive that People had any Boats, or Canows to come to the&s;e I&s;lands. Their Victuals for ought we &s;aw they eat raw. They go all Armed with Bows an Elve long, with Arrows of Reeds, and head|ed with Flint-&s;tone Artificially cut and fa&s;tened.</P>
<P>This Bay by rea&s;on of plenty of Seals we called <HI>Seal Bay</HI> (for we killed 200 in one hour.) And being now well provided, we Sailed thence <HI>June</HI> 3. towards the Pole <HI>Antarctick. June</HI> 12. we Anchored in a little Bay and &s;tayed 2 days, di&s;charging our Caunter the <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> which we laid up here.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 14. We departed and kept our cour&s;e till the <HI>17th.</HI> then we Anchored in a Bay in 50 deg. 20 min. di&s;tant not above a degree off the mouth of the <HI>Streights,</HI> through which lay our way to the South Sea.</P>
<P>Here our General altered his cour&s;e, and &s;teered Northward, to &s;eek after our Ship we had lo&s;t, becau&s;e that if we entred the <HI>Streight</HI> without them, it would go hard with them. And next day being <HI>June</HI> 19. towards night, within a few Leagues of St. <HI>Julian</HI> we found her: and becau&s;e both Ship and men were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by weather,
<PB N="72" REF="40">
our General bare into St. <HI>Julian, June</HI> 20. that he might repair her, and refre&s;h them. It &s;tandeth in 49 deg. 3 min. South. Lat. and hath on the South &s;ide of the Harbor picked Rocks, and in the Harbor many I&s;lands. Being come to Anchor, our General with &s;ome of his Company, rowed further in a Boat, to find out a place for Watering. At his landing 2 of the Inhabitants (by <HI>Magellane</HI> called <HI>Patagous</HI> or <HI>Pentagours</HI> from their huge &s;tature, and &s;trength) vi|&s;ited him, &s;eeming to rejoyce at his arrival: taking great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> (Ma&s;ter Gunner of the Admiral) &s;hoot an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Arrow, trying to &s;hoot with him, but were far &s;hort of him.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e came up, and checkt his fellows for their familiarity with us, and dealt with them to become our Enemies; which our General and his men not &s;u&s;pect|ing, u&s;ed them as before, and one <HI>Robert Winter</HI> &s;hooting an Arrow at length, his Bow-&s;trings broke; which they &s;eeing, fear|ing that more than our other weapons, took courage, and coming behind them, while they, &s;u&s;pecting nothing, were going to|wards their Boat, &s;hot at him who had the Bow, that he might not &s;tring it again, and wounded him in the Shoulder, whereupon he turning about was with another Arrow
<PB N="73" REF="40">
&s;hot through his Lungs, yet he fell not. And the Ma&s;ter Gunner di&s;charging his Calliver, which mi&s;carried, was &s;lain out|right. In this extremity our General, be|having him&s;elf Wi&s;ely and Couragiou&s;ly, ordered his men to &s;hift from place to place, encroaching upon the Enemy, and to u&s;e their Targets and other weapons for their defence, and to break as many Arrows as they could come by; knowing that their Arrows being &s;pent, they could have them at their plea&s;ure. And he him&s;elf &s;hooting off the Calliver, di&s;patched the beginner of the quarrel, who had killed our Ma&s;ter Gunner, whereby the courage of his part|ners was abated, &s;o that they were glad to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight. Our General cho&s;e rather to depart, than take revenge, that he might &s;ave one of his men who was dangerou&s;ly wounded, who notwith|&s;tanding dyed 2 days after he was carried aboard. Our Gunners Body being left a|&s;hore that night, our General next day with his Boat well manned, went a&s;hore to fetch it, which they found lying where it was left, but &s;tript of his outer Garment and an Arrow &s;tuck in his right Eye. Both the&s;e Bodies were decently interred in one Grave.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="41">
<HI>Magellane,</HI> rightly termed them Giants; for they differ from the common &s;ort of men, in Stature, Bigne&s;s, Strength of Body and Hideou&s;ne&s;s of Voice, but they are not &s;o mon&s;trous or Giant like as reported, there being &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men as tall as they. But the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> cruelties have made them more mon&s;trous in mind than they are in Body, and inho&s;pitable to Strangen. Notwith&s;tanding, the terror they conceived of us, &s;o quench't their heat, that they for|got revenge, and &s;eeming to repent of the wrong done us, &s;uffered us to do what we would for 2 months &s;pace without mo|le&s;tation.</P>
<P>To this evil received of them, a greatr was devi&s;ed among our &s;elves, but it was detected and prevented in time, which if it had taken, our General and his faithful Friends, had been murthered, to the final fru&s;trating of our whole de&s;ign.</P>
<P>This Plot had been contrived at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and was di&s;covered to our General there, yet our General gave no credit to it, as being a per&s;on he had &s;uch affection to. And therefore afterward he not only con|tinued his favour (to this &s;u&s;pected per&s;on) but u&s;ed him as his bo&s;om friend. And he was often offended at them who di&s;covered the Treachery to him. But at length per|ceiving
<PB N="75" REF="41">
his lenity did no good, and that his Ambition was not allyed, he re&s;olved to call his practices in que&s;tion before it were too late. And therefore a&s;&s;embling his Captains he had him before them, where the Gentleman knowing him&s;elf Guilty, &s;hewing great remor&s;e for his unkind deal|ing, be&s;ought them to execute ju&s;tice upon him. Whereupon they all adjudged him worthy of death. This judgments was held a&s;hore in one of the I&s;lands of that Port, which in memory of that was called the I&s;land of <HI>True Ju&s;tice and Judgment.</HI> He de&s;ired to receive the Sacrament before his death, which was granted. And <HI>John Fletcher,</HI> Preacher of the Fleet admini&s;tred it to him: Our General likewi&s;e communi|cating with him: afterwards they dined to|gether as lovingly as ever they had done, and took their farewel as they had only been going a Journey. After dinner the &s;entence was executed upon him, he &s;hew|ing great remor&s;e for that heinous crime, and great &s;igns of devotion at his death. Af|terwards we buried him, &s;etting a Mill-&s;tone we found there, broke in two, at his head and feet, and engraved thereod the names of our men that were buried, and a memo|rial of our Captains name in Latine.</P>

After he was executed, our General di&s;charging the <HI>Mary,</HI> our <HI>Portugal</HI> Prize, (being leak) defaced her; and having Wa|tered and Trimmed our Ships, and reduced our Fleet to 3 Ships, be&s;ides our Pinnaces, we departed this Port, <HI>Aug.</HI> 3. and &s;et our cour&s;e for the <HI>Streight,</HI> S.

<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 20.

N. W. and E. S. E. and having lo&s;t it we came to a large Sea; the night following, we had an I&s;land in &s;ight equal to <HI>Fogo</HI> in height, and burning like it.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="42">
It hath formerly been reported as truth, that the Seas have a continual current from Ea&s;t to We&s;t in this <HI>Streight,</HI> but we found it otherwi&s;e, the Ebbings and Flowings be|ing as orderly here as on other Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 24. We fell with 3 I&s;lands bearing Triangle wi&s;e one from another, in one of them, being large and Fruitful, our Ge|neral with &s;ome of his men landed, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in Her Maje&s;ties name, and called it the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> I&s;land. In the other 2, which were not &s;o large, we found good &s;tore of &s;trange Birds, which could not fly at all, nor run &s;o fa&s;t as to e&s;cape us; they are le&s;s than a Goo&s;e, and bigger than a Mal|lard, &s;hort, and well &s;et together, having no Feathers, but in &s;tead thereof a &s;ort of hard and matted Down: their Beeks are like the Bills of Crows, they lodge and breed on Land, where making earths as Coneys do in the Ground, they lay their Eggs.

From the&s;e I&s;lands to the entry of the South Sea the Frete is very crooked. And though it be true that <HI>Magellane</HI> reporteth of this pa&s;&s;age that there are many fair Har|bors and &s;tore of fre&s;h Water, yet when any contrary Winds ari&s;e, it is extremely dangerous.</P>

<P>From <HI>Sept.</HI> 7. (when the &s;torm began) till <HI>Oct.</HI> 7. we could not recover Land (be|ing driven to 37 deg. of South.

So that now our Admiral was left alone, and altho our General &s;ought the re&s;t of his Fleet carefully, yet could by no means find them.

But it plea&s;ed God of his infinite mercy, when all our hopes were gone, miraculou&s;ly to deliver us. Being thus delivered, we were nece&s;&s;itated to &s;eek for &s;ome place of refuge, both to provide nece&s;&s;aries, and refre&s;h our men.

<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 30. We departed thence &s;teering our cour&s;e North-we&s;t, to coa&s;t along <HI>Peru</HI> (be|ing the appointed place for our Fleet to re|a&s;&s;emble) the next day we came to 2 I&s;lands, wherein were great &s;tore of Birds, whereof we were &s;ufficiently furni&s;hed with Victuals; Thence, &s;teering &s;till North-we&s;t, we found our &s;elves, like to have been deceived in taking our rules by the common Maps, which &s;et down the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> to lye 12 deg. Northwards from the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Streight</HI> when it is quite contrary, and therefore we altered our Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>That part of <HI>Peru</HI> all along to the height of <HI>Lima</HI> being 12 deg. South of the Line, is mountainous and barren, except a few

<P>Being thus fallen with the Land, we Coa&s;ted along till we came to 37 deg. and finding no convenient place, nor likelyhood of hearing of our Ships, we ran off with an I&s;land in &s;ight called by the <HI>Spaniards Mucho,</HI> where we Anchored <HI>Nov.</HI> 25. and found it to be a fruitful I&s;land, well &s;tored with all nece&s;&s;aries, as Sheep, and other Cattel, Maiz, a kind of Grain they make Bread of, <HI>Potatos</HI> and &s;uch other Roots be&s;ides it is plenteous of Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The In|habitants are &s;uch <HI>Indians</HI> as by the cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were driven from the Main. With them our General intended to Traffick for Victuals and Water; and for that end the &s;ame night we arrived, he and &s;ome others went a&s;hore, to whom the Peo|ple &s;hewed re&s;pect, making a pre&s;ent to our General; we al&s;o pre&s;ented them &s;uch things as we had, &s;ignifying that we came to Traffick, and recruit our &s;elves with fre&s;h Water; and they promi&s;ed to furni&s;h us with &s;uch things as they could afford. The next day our General repaired to the &s;hore, and &s;ent 2 of his men, with their <HI>Baricoes</HI> to the Watering place a&s;&s;igned, who ha|ving pa&s;t half of the way, were traiterou&s;ly &s;lain by the People; who having likewi&s;e

&s;et an ambu&s;h for our General and the re&s;t of our men that were in the Boat, behind the Rocks, &s;uddenly wounded mo&s;t of our men, before they could free them&s;elves; our Ge|neral be&s;ides &s;everal wounds on the face and head, had one pa&s;&s;ing through his No&s;e into the <HI>Ba&s;is Cerebri.</HI> But the wor&s;t of all was, we had none to cure our men &s;ave a Surgeons Boy, yet it plea&s;ed God they were all cured. The cau&s;e of this barbarity of the&s;e I&s;landers was their hatred to the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> (whom they &s;u&s;pected us to be.) Our General tho he might have revenged this with &s;mall lo&s;s, yet valuing the lo&s;s of one of his more than 100 of theirs, he de&s;i&s;ted, committing his cau&s;e to God. The weapons this People u&s;e in their Wars are Arrows of Reeds with heads of Stones very brittle and indented, and Darts of a great length headed with Iron, or Bone. The &s;ame day that this hap|pened we departed thence, and becau&s;e we were nownear the appointed place of meeting, and partly becau&s;e our men were cra&s;ie, we &s;et in for &s;ome convenient place in the Main, and coming to the Bay called <HI>Philips-Bay</HI> in about 32 deg. we dropt Anchor, and &s;ent our Boat to di&s;cover, if the place could fur|ni&s;h us with &s;uch things as we needed; they after long Travel, could &s;ee no appearance of relief, either as to Victuals or Water,

&s;eeing nothing &s;ave huge heads of wild Buffs; but in their return, they e&s;pied an <HI>Indian</HI> fi&s;hing in his Canow, whom they brought aboard. Who being courteou&s;ly entertained, after we had &s;hewed him what we had, and made him under&s;tand what we needed, we &s;ent him away with our Boat and his own Canow to land him where he would; who at his landing, willed our men to &s;tay till his return, and anon met 2 or 3 of his friends, to whom he &s;hewed his gifts; which gave &s;uch content, that a little after, he with their Governour and others came to us, bringing with them Hens, Eggs, Hogs and &s;uch like, and (that they might remove &s;u&s;picion of evil) they &s;ent it in a Ca|now by it &s;elf, and their Governor entru&s;t|ed him&s;elf to our men, and came to our Ge|neral. By him we under&s;tood, we could not be relieved here, but he offered to conduct us to a Harbor not far di&s;tant to the Southward, where we might have all nece&s;&s;aries; which our Gen. accepted of; and <HI>Dec.</HI> 4. depart|ed hence, and next day came to an Anchor in that Harbor. It is called by the <HI>Spaniards Valperizo,</HI> and the Town adjoyning St. <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Chinly;</HI> it is in 35 deg. 40 min. here we had all nece&s;&s;aries in abundance: among&s;t other things we found in the Town, diver&s;e &s;tore-hou&s;es of the Wines of <HI>Chinly,</HI> and in

<P>Being thus provided our General was for &s;eeking after our Ships; And con&s;idering that we could not conveniently run in with our Ship to every Harbor, and that our Boat could not carry men enough, to en|counter the violence of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if we happen'd to meet them, we determined, as we went toward the Line to &s;eek out a convenient place, where we might trim our Ship, and build a Pinnace.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 19. We entred a Bay to the South|ward of the Town of <HI>Cyppo</HI> Inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in 29 deg. 30 min. and ha|ving landed 14 of our men to &s;earch, we were di&s;covered by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who &s;ent out 300 men, 100 of them being <HI>Spaniards,</HI> well mounted on Hor&s;es, the re&s;t <HI>Indians</HI> running as Dogs at their heels all naked.

But our men &s;eeing them come, made all their e&s;cape, &s;ave one <HI>Richard Minivy,</HI> who being too bold, would not be entreated to e&s;cape with the re&s;t, but cho&s;e either to out|brave them, or die in the place; which he did. His Body was by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be|headed, his right hand cut off, his heart pluckt out, all which they carried away in our &s;ight, the re&s;t of his Body they cau&s;ed the <HI>In|dians</HI> to &s;hoot full of Arrows made of green wood, and left it, which we buried next day. Finding but bad entertainment here we departed, and next day came to a conve|nient Harbor to the Northward of it, in 27 deg. 55 min. South Lat. where we trimmed our Ship, and built our Pinnace; which done our General, with &s;ome of his Company went in the Pinnace, in &s;earch of our Ships, but after a days &s;ailing, were forced to return by contrary wind.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 9. we left this place, and <HI>Jan.</HI> 22. came to an I&s;land in the &s;ame height with the North Cape of <HI>Mormorena;</HI> here we met with 4 <HI>Indians</HI> in their Canows, who promi&s;ed to bring us to a place where we might Water, but when we came thither, we &s;carce found any. As we were &s;earch|ing for Water, we lighted on a <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;leeping, who had by him 13 Bars of Sil|ver, weighing 4000 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Duccats which
<PB N="89" REF="48">
we took. Not far from hence we met with another <HI>Spaniard</HI> with an <HI>Indian</HI> Boy, driv|ing 8 <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, each Sheep bearing 2 leathern bags, in each of which was 50 pound weight of fine Silver, which we likewi&s;e took.</P>
<P>Beyond the Cape afore&s;aid we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal <HI>Indian</HI> Towns, the People whereof came to us in Boats made of &s;everal Skins, of which 2 being joyned together of equal length in form of a Boat, having in each of them a &s;mall Gut, or &s;ome &s;uch thing blown full of Wind, whereby it floateth, and is rowed very &s;wiftly; they exchanged with us Fi&s;hes for Knives, Gla&s;&s;es and &s;uch like, great rarities to them.</P>
<P>Not far hence lies <HI>Mormorena</HI> in 22 deg. 30 min. where tho 2 <HI>Spaniards</HI> governed, yet we exchanged with them for &s;everal Commodities: among other things Sheep which were as big as a Cow, with &s;trength proportioned; on one of their backs at one time 3 men and a Boy might &s;it without touching the ground by a foot, without any trouble; their Wool is very fine, their fle&s;h good, and they &s;erve in &s;tead of Hor&s;es for burdens.

which &s;tood in the fruitfulle&s;t &s;oil in all that Coa&s;t; it is Inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> In 2 Barks here we found Forty and odd Bars of Silver, each weighing about 20 <HI>l.</HI> which we took; and &s;o went to <HI>Chowley, Feb.</HI> 9. and in our way to <HI>Lima</HI> we took a Bark loaden with Linnen: <HI>Feb.</HI> 15. we arrived at <HI>Lima,</HI> and tho the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had 30 Ships in the Harbor, we Anchored a|mong the mid&s;t of them. <HI>Lima</HI> is in 12 deg. 30 min. Here we heard of a Ship that had 1500 Bars of Silver in her be&s;ides other things we boarded her and took what we had a mind to. Here al&s;o we had news of the Ks. of <HI>Portugal,</HI> of <HI>Morocco</HI> and <HI>Fez</HI> all dead in one day at one Battel; al&s;o of the death of the K. of <HI>France</HI> and the Pope. La&s;tly here we had notice of a rich Ship laden with Gold and Silver for <HI>Panama,</HI> that had &s;et &s;ail from this Haven: Where|upon <HI>Feb.</HI> 16. we went in pur&s;uit of her. <HI>Feb.</HI> 20. We fell with the Port of <HI>Paita</HI> in 4 deg. 40 m. with St. <HI>Helen</HI> and the River <HI>Gutaquil, Feb.</HI> 24. We pa&s;t the Line 28, and <HI>Mar.</HI> 1.

<P>And being now come to Cape <HI>Franci&s;co</HI> in 1 deg. <HI>N.</HI> Lat. and hearing nothing of our Ships all the way, tho we enquired diligently, we concluded they were not before us; and con&s;idering that now was the only time (Sum|mer approaching) for the di&s;covery of what pa&s;&s;age there was to be found about the Nor|thern parts of <HI>America</HI> from the South Sea in|to our Ocean, which our General chiefly de|&s;igned, we all willingly con&s;ented to &s;eek out a convenient place for furni&s;hing our &s;elves, and trimming our Ship in order there|to. And &s;o we &s;et on <HI>March</HI> 7. to the I&s;land of <HI>Caines</HI> at which we arrived <HI>March</HI> 16. and &s;ettled in a fre&s;h River for our purpo&s;e afore&s;aid. In our Journey hither, we met with a Ship laden with Linnen, and <HI>China</HI> Silk and Di&s;hes, and a Faulcon of Gold with a great Emerauld in its brea&s;t. We depar|ted hence <HI>March</HI> 24. for our intended di&s;co|very, and pa&s;&s;ed by the Port <HI>Papagaia,</HI> and diver&s;e others, and &s;ome Gulphs which con|tinually &s;end forth violent Winds. And un|der&s;tanding that if we did not run off to Sea
<PB N="92" REF="50" MS="y">
we &s;hould be troubled with Calms, our Ge|neral determined to go into &s;ome Port to fur|ni&s;h our &s;elves with all nece&s;&s;aries, that we might go to Sea. And accordingly <HI>April</HI> 15. 1679. we entred <HI>Guatulco,</HI> in 15. deg. 46. min. inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where we had nece&s;&s;aries, as al&s;o a Pot as big as a Bu&s;hel full of Ryals of Plate, with a Chain of Gold and Jewels.</P>
<P>From thence we departed to Sea <HI>Apr.</HI> 16. and &s;ailed 500 Leagues for a Wind, and until <HI>June</HI> 23. 1500 Leagues in all, till we came to 42. deg. of North. Latitude, where in the Night time we were oppre&s;t with extreme nipping cold, whereby &s;everal of our mens health was impaired, and the day following notwith&s;tanding the heat of the Sun, the cold was nothing abated, &s;o that the Ropes of our Ships were frozen, and the Rain which fell was a kind of Icy &s;ub&s;tance. And when we came 2 degrees further it was in that ex|tremity, that our men could not make u&s;e of their hands, not to feed them&s;elves; and our Meat as it was removed from the fire was in a manner immediately frozen, whereby our men were extremely di&s;couraged; yet by our Generals per&s;ua&s;ions, they re&s;olved to endure a little extremity to obtain agreater Glory.</P>
<P>The Land in that part of America lying
<PB N="93" REF="50">
nearer the We&s;t, than we imagined, we were nearer it than we were aware; and the nearer it we came the colder it was. <HI>June</HI> 5. we were driven on the &s;hore by contrary Winds, and ca&s;t Anchor in a Bay, where we were in danger by rea&s;on of extream flaws that beat upon us, and upon their inter|mi&s;&s;ion were troubled with thick, &s;tinking Fogs.</P>
<P>In this place we could not abide, by rea&s;on of cold, and therefore were forced to go Southwards again. From the height of 48. to 38. coa&s;ting along the Land, we found it to be plain; every hill (which were many but not high) though it was <HI>June,</HI> was co|vered with Snow. <HI>June</HI> 17. in 38. deg. 30. min. we found a fit Harbor and anchored therein, continuing till <HI>July</HI> 23. and were &s;till mole&s;ted with cold. We conjecture upon &s;e|veral rea&s;ons that either there is no Northern pa&s;&s;age, or at lea&s;t not navigable, for to pa&s;s by others this &s;eems to confirm it, that tho we &s;earched the Coa&s;t diligently even to 48. deg. yet found we not the Land to trend &s;o much as one point in any place towards the Ea&s;t, but rather running on towards the Northwe&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 18. The Countrey People &s;ent out a man in a Canow to us, who directed his di&s;cour&s;e to us all the way as he came;

and being come near us, he had a tedious Oration, u&s;ing many motions; which ended with great &s;hew of reverence he returned: He came again the 2d. time as al&s;o the 3d. after the &s;ame manner, and brought with him, as a pre&s;ent, a Bunch of Feathers arti|ficially gathered on a &s;tring, made for tho&s;e who guard the Kings Per&s;on to wear on their heads, he brought al&s;o a Basket made of Ru&s;hes, filled with an Herb, called <HI>Tabak.</HI> Our General proffered him &s;everal things, but he would receive nothing &s;ave a Hat.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21. Our Ship being leaky we put in to the &s;hore to repair her; (but to prevent all danger, our General landed all his men, with nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions to build Tents, and make a Fort for us; Which the Coun|try People &s;eeing, came down in great ha&s;t to us with &s;uch Arms as they had, yet with no intent to hurt us, their intent being ra|ther to wor&s;hip us as Gods. And being willed by &s;igns to lay from them their Bows and Arrows, they did it in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>To the intent therefore that this Peace which was de&s;ired might be more confirmed, our General treated them very courteou&s;ly, be&s;towing upon them Shirts, Linnen, and other things, to cover their nakedne&s;s, withal &s;ignifying unto them, that we were but men

as they were, which notwith&s;tanding, we could hardy per&s;uade them of. They in re|compen&s;e be&s;towed on our General and others of our men, Feathers, Cawls, and Quivers of their Arrows, made of Fawns Skins, and Skins of Bea&s;ts their women wore; and &s;o departed with joy to their Hou&s;es; which are digged round within the earth, having clefts of Wood &s;et up and joyned clo&s;e at the top, like our Spires; they are very warm and without Chimneys; Their Door is like an ordinary &s;cuttle in a Ship &s;lope-wi&s;e, their Beds on the Ground with Ru&s;hes &s;trewed upon it. Their men for mo&s;t part go na|ked; They are of a tractable and loving Nature; Their only Weapons are Bows and Arrows, with which tho they are skillful they do but little execution, they are &s;o &s;light, being more fit for Boys than men; they are prodigiou&s;ly &s;trong and &s;wift. Their Women make them&s;elves loo&s;e Gar|ments of a kind of Bulru&s;hes to cover their lower parts: about their &s;houlders wearing the Skin of a Deer; They are very obedient to their Husbands.</P>
<P>When they were returned home they emitted lamentable Cryings, which we heard tho about an Engli&s;h Miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive demea|nor, our General thought it be&s;t not to tru&s;t

Two days after a great multitude of them came to us, bringing pre&s;ents with them as before, or rather &s;acrifices, they deeming us to be Gods.</P>
<P>When they came to the top of the Hill at the bottom whereof we &s;tayed, they &s;tood, where one with &s;trange ge&s;tures delivered a tedious Oration, at the end whereof all the re&s;t bowing their bodies cried <HI>Oh,</HI> (as a &s;ign of their a&s;&s;ent;) after which their men came down, leaving their Women and Children, with their Bows on the Hill, with pre&s;ents to us, glad that we would receive them of them: in the mean time their Women fell a Crying, Shreeking, and tearing their Fle&s;h from their Cheeks, with a fury ca&s;ting them|&s;elves on the Ground, da&s;hing them&s;elves on hard Stones or any thing it was in their way, tho&s;e that were big with Child not ab|&s;taining from this madne&s;s. Which our Ge|neral &s;eeing fell a praying with Hands lifted up to Heaven (&s;hewing that God, whom we &s;erved, and they ought to wor&s;hip, was above) and &s;ung P&s;alms, and read in the Bible: to all which they were very atten|tive, and took &s;uch delight in our Singing of

P&s;alms, that every time they came to us they de&s;ired us to &s;ing.</P>
<P>Three days after the greate&s;t part of all that People thereabouts a&s;&s;embled, with the King attended with his Guard. Before his coming he &s;ent 2 Amba&s;&s;adors to &s;ignifie it to us; in delivery of their me&s;&s;age, the one &s;poke low the other the &s;ame word for word more au|dibly, which done our General under&s;tood by their &s;igns that they de&s;ired a pre&s;ent of him to their <HI>Hioh</HI> or King; which he &s;ent.</P>
<P>As their King was coming to us, they cried after a &s;inging manner; and as they drew near their carriage was more grave. In their Front a man bare the Scepter (a cer|tain kind of black Wood a Yard and a half in Length) before the King, whereon Hanged 2 Crowns with 3 long Chains, and a bag full of the Herb <HI>Tabah.</HI></P>
<P>Next him that bare this Scepter was the King: on his head was a Cawl of Knit|work &s;omewhat like a Crown: on his Shoul|ders to his Wa&s;t a Coat of Coney Skins; his Guard had Coats of other Skins, &s;ome having Cawls with &s;uch Feathers, or covered with a Down, which groweth on an Herb like Lettice: This Herb is not permitted to be wore by any but tho&s;e that are about the King, and the &s;eed of it is u&s;ed only in &s;acri|fice to their Gods. After the&s;e came the
<PB N="98" REF="53">
common People, naked, who&s;e long hair was tied in a Bunch behind, in which &s;tuck Plumes of Feathers, but in the fore part had but one Feather like a Horn. Every one had his Face painted, but of different colours. Their Women and Children came la&s;t, The Women had Baskets in their Arms, wherein were Bays of <HI>Tabah</HI> and other pre&s;ents: Their Baskets were made of Ru&s;hes, yet in &s;uch &s;ort that mo&s;t part of them would hold Water; they were hanged with pieces of Pearls Shells, and with 2 or 3 links of the Chains, &s;ignifying they were Ve&s;&s;els dedicated to the u&s;e of their Gods.</P>
<P>Our General a&s;&s;embled all his men and ordered them to be in a po&s;ture of defence, that if they attempted any thing again&s;t us might we prevent it.</P>
<P>When they came near us they gave us a general Salutation; after which he that bare the Scepter &s;pake aloud what another whi&s;|pered him in the ear for half an hour, which was ended with a general <HI>Amen;</HI> and all the re&s;t, &s;ave the Children, came down the Hill &s;etting them&s;elves in their former order.</P>
<P>Being come near us the Scepter-bearer with a &s;tately carriage began a &s;ong, dancing thereto, as al&s;o did the King and all the re&s;t, &s;ave the Women, who danced but did not &s;ing. Our General perceiving their &s;imple

meaning ordered that they might have free entrance; they entring continued their Song and Dance a pretty while, their Wo|men following with their Baskets, their faces <HI>&amp;c.</HI> torn as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Afterwards they made a &s;ign to our General to &s;it down, and the King with others made &s;everal Speeches, e&s;iring him by &s;igns to take upon him the King|dom, and afterwards with one con&s;ent they &s;et the Crown upon his Head, with other Ceremonies, honouring him by the name of <HI>Hyoh,</HI> ending the Solemnity with Songs and Dances.</P>
<P>The&s;e things our General accepted of, taking them in the Name and to the U&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty. The Ceremonies ended, the common People of them leaving the King with our General, went among our People, and finding &s;uch as plea&s;ed their Fancies (which commonly were the younge&s;t of us) they enclo&s;ing them round offered &s;a|crifices; Crying with lamentable &s;hreeks, weeping, &s;cratching, and tearing the fle&s;h off their Faces.</P>
<P>After our nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;&s;es were di&s;|patched, our General with &s;ome of his Company went up into the Land, to be bet|ter acquainted with the Nature and Commo|dities of their Country. The Inland we

found to be of a very fruitful &s;oyl, Stored with all things fit for man, particularly fat Deer in great numbers. There were like|wi&s;e a &s;trange &s;ort of Conies, their heads and bodies like other Conies, but &s;maller; their Tails like that of a Rat, and their Feet like the Paws of a Mole. Under their Chins on each &s;ide they have a Bag into which they gather their meat when their Bellies are full, to feed their young, or &s;orve them&s;elves another time. Their Skins are of great ac|count, for their Kings Holy-days coat is made of them.</P>

<P>Before our departure thence, our General cau&s;ed to be &s;et up a Plate of Bra&s;s nailed to a Po&s;t, with her Maje&s;ties name and picture, and Arms on a Sixpence, the day and year of our Arrival, and of their re&s;igning the Kingdom into Her Maje&s;ties hands, as a Mo|nument of Her Maje&s;ties Right and Title to that Kingdom.</P>
<P>And now the time of our departure ap|proaching, tho&s;e People, who had formerly &s;o much joy in our Company, were now &s;orrowful and dejected beyond all mea&s;ure, all their former joy being metamorpho&s;ed

into Mourning at the report of our de|parture.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 23. They took a &s;orrowful Wel|fare of us, entreating us to remember them in our ab&s;ence, and to return to them, and im|mediately ran up to the tops of the Hills to keep &s;ight of us as long as they could, making Fires on all hands. Near this place lye &s;ome I&s;lands, which we called the I&s;lands of St. <HI>James,</HI> where we had a great many Seals and Birds.</P>
<P>Our General now con&s;idering, that the cold encrea&s;ed, the Sun being now nearer the South, left off his de&s;ign of finding pa&s;&s;age through the Northern parts, and therefore with con&s;ent of the re&s;t bent his Cour&s;e for the <HI>Moluccaes</HI> and &s;ailed without &s;ight of Land for 68 days &s;pace, and <HI>Sept.</HI> 30. came to &s;ome I&s;lands, lying in 8 deg. North. Lat. As &s;oon as we were perceived, a great number of Canows came towards us, bringing with them Coquo's, Fi&s;h, Po|tato's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Their Canows, as mo&s;t of the <HI>Moluc|caes</HI> are made of one Tree hollowed within with great art, very &s;mooth; their Prow and Stern were of one fa&s;hion, yielding in|ward, very high, and hanged full of gli|&s;tering &s;hells; on each &s;ide their Canows

lay out 2 pieces of Timber to keep them from overwhelming.</P>
<P>The People have the nether part of their ears cut round hanging down on their Cheeks; the Nails on &s;ome of their Fingers were an Inch long, and their Teeth black as Pitch, the colour whereof they u&s;e to renew with a certain Powder. The fir&s;t Company of tho&s;e Canows, began to Traffique with us peaceably, entreating us to go nearer the &s;hore, that they might ea&s;ilier prey upon us. But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ing away, others came that di&s;covered their Natures, for when they got any thing in their hands, they would neither give recompence nor re&s;tore it; and being rejected for their bad dealing, they began to re&s;ent it, throwing &s;tones at us which they had brought on purpo&s;e; whereupon our General cau&s;ed let fly a great Gun; at the noi&s;e of which they, frightned, leapt out of their Canows into the Water, and diving under the Keel of their Boat &s;tayed there till we were gone a good way from them, and then recovered their Canows and made ha&s;t to the &s;hore. Notwith&s;tanding we were af|terwards troubled with others of the &s;ame gang, and could not be rid of them, till we made them &s;mart. And &s;o we left this I&s;land <HI>Octob.</HI> 23. naming it the <HI>I&s;land of Thieves,</HI> and <HI>Octob.</HI> 16. fell with 4 I&s;lands in 7 deg.

Ea&s;t from them lyes a great I&s;land, called <HI>Gillola.</HI> We intended to go to <HI>Tidore,</HI> but coa&s;ting an I&s;land of the King of <HI>Tere|nat's</HI> his Deputy came off to us, who en|treated our General to &s;tay at <HI>Terenate,</HI> for that his King would be glad of his coming, and would a&s;&s;i&s;t him to his utmo&s;t Power, whereas if he went to <HI>Tidore,</HI> (inhabited by <HI>Portugals)</HI> he would find them deceitful; and be&s;ides, that then his King would not re|ceive us, as being at enmity with them. Hereupon our General next Morning came to an anchor there, and &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the King, with a Velvet Cloak for a pre&s;ent: &s;ignifying to him, that he de&s;ired to be &s;up|plyed with nece&s;&s;aries, for which he would give him other goods, and likewi&s;e that it was by per&s;ua&s;ion of his Viceroy that he came thither. But before this the Viceroy had &s;poke to the King on our behalf, &s;hewing how beneficial an Alliance with us would be to him, and how di&s;couraging to
<PB N="104" REF="56">
his Enemies. Whereupon the King imme|diately &s;ent the Viceroy with others of his Nobles to our General, to &s;hew him that he was ready to do any thing for us that lay in his power, upon our Prince's account; and that he would &s;hortly vi&s;it us in our Ship. By that time they came to us, our Me&s;&s;engers were at Court, who were honorably con|ducted to the King, and mo&s;t Graciou&s;ly by him entertained. Whereupon the Prince ha&s;tened his before promi&s;ed vi&s;it; the manner of his coming was thus:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, he &s;ent before 3 great Canows wherein were &s;ome of his Nobles of all ages, attired all in white Lawn, or Cloath of Ca|lecute, but with &s;ome difference, their Canow covered from one End to t'other with fine Mats, bore up by a frame of Reeds.</P>
<P>The re&s;t were Souldiers &s;tanding orderly on both &s;ides, without whom were the Ro|wers, in 3 Galleries on each &s;ide, lying off the &s;ide 3 or 4 yards, one built lower than the other; in each of which Galleries was a like number of Banks that the Rowers &s;ate upon: On the forepart of each Canow &s;ate 2 men, one holding a Tabret, the other a piece of Bra&s;s, who &s;triking therewith by the &s;ound directed the Rowers to keep their Strokes; and the Rowers ending their Strokes with a &s;ong, gave warning to the others to &s;trike
<PB N="105" REF="56">
again. They had in each Canow one &s;mall Piece; be&s;ides every man had his Sword, Dagger, and Target, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Canows coming near our Ship rowed round us one after another, and the men as they pa&s;&s;ed did us homage, the greate&s;t Per&s;ons beginning; afterwards putting our Me&s;&s;enger aboard, they told us that their King had &s;ent them before him to conduct our Ship into a better Road.</P>
<P>Not long after the King came up with 6 grave Fathers and did obey&s;ance to us in humble manner. He was of a tall &s;tature, Corpulent, of a Princely Countenance. His re&s;pect among his Subjects was very great, none of his Councillors daring &s;peak to him but on their Knees.</P>
<P>We received him in be&s;t &s;ort we could, as with di&s;charging of Ordinance, and great &s;tore of &s;mall &s;hot, &s;ounding of Trumpets, and other In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, wherewith the King was extremely delighted. Be|&s;ides, our General gave him &s;ome pre&s;ents. His Brother likewi&s;e made us a vi&s;it, and was al&s;o courteou&s;ly entertained by our Ge|neral. The King when we came to Anchor, departed, promi&s;ing to come aboard next day, and in the mean time to &s;end us nece&s;&s;aries: Which the &s;ame night and next morning we had by way of Traffique, as Hens, Rice,
<PB N="106" REF="57">
Sugar Canes, Liquid Sugar, a fruit they call <HI>Figo</HI> the &s;ame which the <HI>Portugals</HI> name <HI>Plantanes, Cocoes</HI> and a kind of Meal they call <HI>Sago,</HI> made of the tops of Trees, ta&s;ting like &s;our Curds, but melting like Sugar. The Inhabitants make a kind of Cake thereof which will keep good ten years: We had al&s;o &s;ome Cloves. Our General having all things provided, expected the King at the time appointed; who came not, but &s;ent his Brother with his Apology, entreating our General to come a &s;hore; that his Brother in the mean while &s;hould remain aboard as a pledge for his &s;afety; but the Company would by no means permit him, e&s;pecially for that his Brother had dropt &s;ome Words aboard which gave &s;u&s;picion of ill intent. Our General therefore in his &s;tead &s;ent &s;ome of his Gentlemen with the Kings Brother to Court, detaining the Viceroy for a Pledge. They being come near the Ca&s;tle were re|ceived by another of the King; Brothers and Per&s;ons of Quality, and conducted honorably to the Ca&s;tle; where being brought into a &s;tately Hou&s;e, a great multitude was there, the greate&s;t Per&s;ons being placed round the Hou&s;e according to their degrees, the re&s;t remaining without.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e was four &s;quare, covered with Cloath of diver&s;e colours, born up on a
<PB N="107" REF="57">
Frame of Reeds, the &s;ides being open, and furni&s;hed with &s;eats round; this it &s;eems was their Council Hou&s;e. At the &s;ide of this Hou&s;e next the Ca&s;tle, was &s;eated the Chair of State, with a large Canopy over it; the ground al&s;o for 10 or 12 paces round it was covered with Cloath of Arras. There were &s;eated 60 Ancient Noblemen, of the Kings Council; at the nether end of the Hou&s;e, were a great Company of Young men in good attire; without on the right &s;ide of the Hou&s;e were 4 old men attired in long red Garments, their heads after the Turki&s;h Fa&s;hion, who lived as Lidgiers there, to keep continual Traffique with this People, with &s;everal others of foreign Nations.</P>
<P>The King at la&s;t coming attended by 8 or 10 Grave Senators had a rich Canopy born over him, guarded with 12 Lances, the points downwards; our men With His Brother met him, and were graciou&s;ly en|tertained.</P>
<P>The Kings Attire was very &s;umptuous; From his Wa&s;te downwards was all rich Cloath of Gold, his Legs bare, on his Feet Shoes of Cordivant died red; on his Cap were diver&s;e Rings of plated Gold, an Inch and a half broad; a great Chain of Gold about his Neck; on his left hand a Diamond,

an Emerald, a Ruby and Turky; on his Right hand Rings &s;et with rich Stones.</P>
<P>As he &s;ate in his Chair of State, a Page &s;tood by him with a Fan, richly embroy|dered with Saphires. Our Gentlemen hav|ing delivered their Me&s;&s;age, and received an&s;wer were &s;afely conducted back again.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was of no &s;trength, there being only 2 Cannons there, and tho&s;e un|mounted, which were left by the <HI>Portugals</HI> by whom the Ca&s;tle was built: Who by their Tyrannies exerci&s;ed both on their King and People, which they did to confirm them|&s;elves, &s;o incen&s;ed the People that they were forced to leave it with their furniture in it.</P>
<P>The People are <HI>Moors</HI> very &s;uper&s;titious in ob&s;ervations of New Moons, and Fa&s;tings; For on tho&s;e days the Viceroy when aboard of us, would neither eat nor drink in the day, though in the Night he ate very largely.</P>
<P>While we &s;tayed here a goodly Gentlemen of a di&s;creet behaviour came aboard to view our Ship, and di&s;cour&s;e our Captain. He was born in the Province of <HI>Baghia</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> who&s;e Predece&s;&s;ors had reigned there 200 years. The Cau&s;e of his coming from home, was, that being accu&s;ed of Trea&s;on, and tho innocent, yet could not make it appear,
<PB N="109" REF="58">
and knowing the &s;trictne&s;s of the Law there, he petitioned the King that he would plea&s;e to commit his Trial to Gods providence, and permit him to travel, with condition that if he brought not home &s;ome con&s;ide|rable Intelligence, the King had never be|fore heard of, he &s;hould die; the King gran|ted his &s;ute, and he had been now 3 years at <HI>Tidore.</HI> He earne&s;tly entreated our General to declare unto him &s;uch if he could, and likewi&s;e all occurrences happening in his long and dangerous Voyage; wherein our General &s;atisfied him; he likewi&s;e informing our General of all things worth notice in their Country, withal entreating him to go along with him to <HI>China,</HI> but our General could not be per&s;uaded thereto.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 9. We &s;et &s;ail thence, and con&s;idering our Ship needed reparation we determined to &s;eek for a convenient place for that pur|po&s;e, and <HI>Nov.</HI> 14. we arrived at an I&s;land South of <HI>Celebes,</HI> in 1 deg. 40 min.

<P>The whole I&s;land is overgrown with Wood; the Trees are large, high and &s;traight, the leaves whereof are like our Broom; among the&s;e Trees were a multi|tude

There was here al&s;o a great number of Bats, of the Bigne&s;s of a Hen, with flie wonderfully &s;wift, but their flight is &s;hort, and when they light they hang by the Boughs with their Backs downwards. There was here likewi&s;e a Kind of Cray Fi&s;h, of &s;uch &s;ize that one would &s;atisfie 4 men, being very whole&s;om Food. They do not live in the Sea, but dig them&s;elves caves under the roots of Trees, lodging by Companies; when we came to take them they climbed up Trees to hide them&s;elves. This I&s;land we called <HI>Crab I&s;land. Dec.</HI> 12. We put to Sea, and on the 16 had &s;ight of <HI>Celebes</HI> or <HI>Sillebis;</HI> but having a bad Wind, and being entangled with I&s;lands, and other difficulties and dangers, we could not recover the North of <HI>Sillebis,</HI> or continue or cour&s;e further We&s;t, but were nece&s;&s;itated to &s;teer Southwards, finding that cour&s;e very dangerous by rea&s;on of the many Shoals; and <HI>Jan.</HI> 9. when we thought we were pa&s;t all danger, and had a pro&s;perous Gale of Wind, of a Sudden, when we were &s;ailing with full Sail, in the beginning of the fir&s;t night Watch, our Ship was laid fa&s;t on a de&s;perate Shoal; where we expected nothing but pre&s;ent death.

Our next E&s;&s;ay was for good ground and anchor-hold to Seaward of us, whereon to hale, by which means, if by any, our General told us there was &s;ome hope left; but when we &s;ounded, we found that even a Boats length from the Ship we could not find ground; &s;o that our hopes quite vani&s;hed, and nothing but pre&s;ent death, or at lea&s;t a lingring death was before us. In tho&s;e fears and perplexities we &s;pent this night; next morning we tryed to &s;ee if we could now find any Anchor-hold, but this &s;ucceeded no better than the former. But it plea&s;ed God miraculou&s;ly to deliver us, &s;o that we got clear of it.</P>
<P>This Shoal is 3024 Leagues in length, &amp; lyes in 1 deg. betwixt 56 and 57. min. South. Lat. This was the greate&s;t danger we met with in our whole Voyage.

After|wards putting off to Sea we met with more <HI>French</HI> Ships, returning with <HI>Newland</HI> Fi&s;h, whom our General, after &s;peech with them di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, without doing them any hurt. The next day we de&s;cried another Ship of 240 Tun, and Mr. <HI>Carleil</HI> Lieut.

<P>Two days after we put in at the I&s;les of <HI>Bayon,</HI> the winds cro&s;&s;ing us, and anchored.

<P>Capt. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> returned with this an&s;wer, That the Governor &s;aid he knew of no Wars; And as for the &s;tay of the Mer|chants, that it was the Kings plea&s;ure, but with no intent to injure them, and that afterwards by the Kings Order they were di&s;charged, for confirmation of which he &s;ent &s;uch Merchants as were in Town of our own Nation: Upon which it was ad|vi&s;ed, that night to land our Force.

A|bout midnight a Storm ari&s;ing, we went aboard, and before we reached our Fleet, &s;everal of our Ships were driven from their Anchor Holds, of which one was driven back to <HI>England,</HI> but all the re&s;t came up to us again. The Storm la&s;ted three days, which being over our Lieut.

he found one Boat laden with the principal Church-Stuff of the High-Church of <HI>Vigo,</HI> where al&s;o was their great Cro&s;s of Silver, of embo&s;&s;ed Work, double gilt all over. All we had in this place amounted to 30000 Duckets. The next day the whole Fleet went up to a Harbor above <HI>Vigo,</HI> where the Lieut. Gen. &s;tayed our coming. In the mean time the Governor of <HI>Gali&s;ia</HI> had rai&s;ed 2000 Foot, and 300 Hor&s;e, and marched from <HI>Bayon</HI> to this place, and &s;ent to parly with our General, which was grant|ed; at their meeting it was agreed, that we &s;hould have Water and other Nece&s;&s;aries, paying for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Afterwards we departed for the <HI>Canaries;</HI> and fell with <HI>Palma</HI> with purpo&s;e to have landed there, but by rea&s;on of the many Guns, that were planted there, which were di&s;charged upon us, and other inconve|niences, we were forced to alter our Re&s;o|lution, and determined to land in the I&s;le of <HI>Ferro;</HI> and when we had landed 1000 Men there, and &s;tayed two days, the Inhabitants accompanyed with an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> came to us, declaring their State to be &s;o poor, that they were ready to &s;tarve; which was not untrue; and therefore that night we put to Sea again.</P>

<HI>Nov.</HI> 13.

General, who kept us marching till we came to a convenient Plain, and when we were all gathered there, he thought it be&s;t to make no attempt till day; after we had taken a little re&s;pite, he di|vided the Army into three Parts. By that time we were well ranged daylight appear|ed, and having advanced hard by the Wall, and &s;eeing no Enemy to re&s;i&s;t, the Lieut. Gen. ordered Capt. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> and Capt. <HI>Barton</HI> with 30 &s;hot apiece, to enter the Town, which &s;tood in the Valley under us, and after them was &s;ent <HI>St. Georges</HI> Cro&s;s to be placed towards the Sea, to give adverti&s;e|ment to our Fleet; and that day, being <HI>Nov.</HI> 17. all the great Ordnance about the Town, being above 50 Pieces was &s;hot off in honour of our Queens Coronation day. In the mean while the Lieut. Gen. &s;tayed upon the Hill with mo&s;t of his Forces till the Town was quartered out for lodging the Army, which done every Captain took his

own Quarter, and in the evening kept &s;u&s;|ficient Guard to prevent danger. Here we &s;tayed 14 days taking &s;uch &s;poils as the place afforded, but found no Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Situation of <HI>St. Jago</HI> is in Form like to a Triangle, having on the Ea&s;t and We&s;t &s;ides 2 Rocky Mountains, on the top of which were built &s;ome Fortifications; one the South &s;ide is the Main Sea, and on the North a Valley between the afore&s;aid Mountains, the Valley and Town grow very narrow between the 2 Clifts. In the mid&s;t of the Valley cometh down a Brook of fre&s;h Water, which hard by the Sea maketh a Pond very convenient for Wa|tering. The Valley at the Towns End is wholly converted into Gardens, and Orchards, wherein are diver&s;e &s;orts of Herbs, Fruits and Trees, among which are the Cocoes and Plantens; The Cocoes have a hard &s;hell and green Husk over it, bigger than a mans 2 Fi&s;ts; of the &s;hell drinking Cups are made, within this &s;hell is a white Rine re&s;embling the White of an Egg when it is hard boyled, and within that a Water whiti&s;h and clear, about a half Pint, which are very cool, and as &s;ome &s;ay re&s;torative. The Planten groweth in Cods like to Beans, but bigger, and when it is ripe, the meat of it becometh yellow, and is very plea&s;ant.</P>

While we abode here a <HI>Portugal</HI> came hither with a Flag of Truce, to whom Capt. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> and <HI>Goring</HI> were &s;ent; as they came to him, he asked of what Nation they were, and being told, he asked if there were Wars between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> they an&s;wered, our General could be&s;t &s;atisfie him in that, and proffered him &s;afe conduct if he would go to him; but he refu&s;ed, pretending he was not &s;ent by his Governor. Then they told him, that if his Governor would con&s;ult his own or his Countreys good, his be&s;t cour&s;e were to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to our General, Sir <HI>Fancis Drake,</HI> whereby he might a&s;&s;uredly find favour, otherwi&s;e within 3 days we would march over the Land, and pro&s;ecute them with Fire and Sword.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 24. The Gen. Lieut. Gen. with 600 Men marched to <HI>Sancto Domingo,</HI> a Village 12 Miles within the Land, where the Go|vernor, Bi&s;hop, and better &s;ort lodged but found it abandoned.</P>
<P>After we had &s;tayed a while, we marched homewards; as we were on our way, we &s;aw the Enemy both Hor&s;e and Foot, though not of &s;uch Force as to encounter us.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 26. Our General ordered the Army to be embarqued into their Ships, and Capt. <HI>Goring</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Tucker,</HI> with 100 Foot
<PB N="124" REF="66">
were ordered to make a &s;tand in the Market place, till our Forces were all embarqued, the Vice-Admiral waiting to take them aboard. And al&s;o our General ordered Capt. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> with a Party to &s;eek out &s;uch Munition as was hidden in the ground at the Town of <HI>Praie,</HI> having been promi&s;ed to be &s;hewed it by a Pri&s;oner taken the day before. When they came thither, the Pri&s;oner failed of his pro|mi&s;e; and they &s;earching all &s;u&s;pected places, found a Piece of Ordnance of Iron, and an|other of Bra&s;s. In the afternoon our General anchored the Fleet before <HI>Praie,</HI> and went a&s;hore, and cau&s;ed us burn the Town, and af|terwards embarqued the &s;ame night, and put off to Sea Southwe&s;t.</P>
<P>Before our departure from St. <HI>Jago</HI> the Gen. admini&s;tred the Oath of Supremacy to the Souldiers, as al&s;o an Oath for every man to do his utmo&s;t for the &s;ervice of the Action, and to obey the Orders of the Gen. and his Officers.</P>
<P>All the time of our being here none of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came near us: the cau&s;e of which, we conjecture, was the fre&s;h remembrance of Injuries they had done &s;ome of our Coun|treymen, by rea&s;on whereof we left tokens of our di&s;content.</P>
<P>From hence we put over to the We&s;t<HI>-Indies,</HI> and in our way were afflicted with a
<PB N="125" REF="66">
grievous di&s;temper, whereof above 300 died in a few days: This &s;ickne&s;s &s;ei&s;ed our People, with extream heat and a burning Ague; and tho&s;e that e&s;caped, &s;uffered a great diminution in their &s;trength and wits. In 18 days &s;pace we had &s;ight of the I&s;land of <HI>Dominica,</HI> which is inhabited by a &s;avage People, who go all naked, their Skin is co|loured with paint of a reddi&s;h Tawney; per&s;onable and &s;trong men; they admit little conver&s;e with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> yet they u&s;ed us very kindly, helping us with nece&s;&s;a|ries; they brought us &s;tore of Tobacco, as al&s;o a kind of Bread, called <HI>Ca&s;&s;ado,</HI> very white and &s;avory, made of the Roots of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ania;</HI> for which we gave them Gla&s;s, coloured Beads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we went to the We&s;twards of St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> I&s;land, where we &s;pent &s;ome days of <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s,</HI> but could &s;ee no Inhabitants. Here it was unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved, to proceed to <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> And by the way we met a &s;mall Frigat, bound thither, which we took, and having exa|mined the Men, one of them informed us, that it was a barren Haven, and the Land well fortified with a Ca&s;tle, &s;o that we could not land within 10 Miles of the City; to which place he promi&s;ed to conduct us.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="67">
Hereupon we went on all this night in our Voyage, and the General put him&s;elf into the Bark <HI>Francis,</HI> as Admiral, and in the Morning, we came to the afore&s;aid place, 10 Miles We&s;tward of <HI>Domingo.</HI> When we were landed, our General returned to his Fleet, committing the Charge of us to the Lieut. Gen. We marched at 8 a Clock, and at Noon we approached the Town, where tho&s;e of the better &s;ort, about 150 Hor&s;e, began to pre&s;ent them&s;elves, but we &s;o played upon them with our &s;mall &s;hot, that they &s;oon retreated, &s;o that we had leave to proceed towards the two Gates of the Town, that were next the Sea. They had manned them both, and planted their Ordnance, and al&s;o &s;ome Troops of &s;mall &s;hot in <HI>Ambu&s;cado</HI> by the way &s;ide. We di|vided our whole Force, being 1200, to attack both the Gates.</P>
<P>Their Ordnance was no &s;ooner di&s;charged on us, doing but &s;mall execution, but our Lieut. Gen. advanced with all &s;peed, to pre|vent their recharging, and notwith&s;tanding their <HI>Ambu&s;cadoes,</HI> we quickly entred the Gates, and forthwith repaired to a &s;pacious Square before the great Church; whither al&s;o came Capt. <HI>Powel</HI> with the other Party. This place we fortified and &s;tayed here all day. After Midnight they that were in the
<PB N="127" REF="67">
Ca&s;tle hearing us at the Gates, for&s;ook it, &s;ome flying others taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Next day we quartered through the Town, and kept this Town a Month. One day as we &s;tayed here, the Gen. &s;ent on Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a <HI>Negroe</HI> Boy, with a Flag of White; this Boy meeting unhappily with &s;ome <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they &s;truck him through the Body with one of the Hor&s;emen &s;taves; the Boy notwith&s;tanding returned to our General, and after he had declared it to him, died forthwith in his pre&s;ence. Whereat our General was &s;o incen&s;ed, that he cau&s;ed two Friars, then Pri&s;oners, to be led out to the &s;ame place and hanged, and al&s;o di&s;|patcht a Me&s;&s;enger to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> de|claring that unle&s;s the Party who had killed the Boy were delivered up, every day 2 Pri|&s;oners &s;hould be hanged &s;o long as any were left. Whereupon the day following, he was brought to the Towns End to be delivered up, but our General ordered them to di&s;patch him: which they did.</P>
<P>During our abode here many Treaties pa&s;t between them and us for Ran&s;om of their City, but upon di&s;agreement, all the morning we fired the outmo&s;t hou&s;es, which was hard to perform, they being &s;trong &s;tone Hou&s;es; and tho for 14 days 20 Ma|riners &s;pent the whole forenoon in firing
<PB N="128" REF="68">
Hou&s;es, yet not one third part of the Town was con&s;umed, &s;o that in end being weary of this, we were content to accept of 25000 Duckets (5 &s;. 6. d. <HI>per</HI> Ducket) as a Ran&s;om for the re&s;t of the Town. I cannot omit the relation of a notable in&s;tance of the in|&s;atiable ambition of the <HI>Spani&s;h King:</HI> As we entred his Hou&s;e there, over again&s;t us we &s;pied a large Scutcheon, the Kings Arms; in the lower part thereof is de&s;cribed the Globe of the Earth, and a Hor&s;e &s;tanding, his hinder part within the Globe, and his fore|part without, lifting up as it were to leap, with this Motto: <HI>Non &s;ufficit Orbis, The World is not enough.</HI> Which &s;ome of the wi&s;er <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they were treating with us, were even a&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>Now tho this is naturally a rich Place yet we had no Trea&s;ure here. The rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e the <HI>Indians</HI> were long ago con&s;umed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Tyranny, and for lack of People to work, the Golden and Silver Mines are quite given over, in&s;tead thereof u&s;ing Copper. Their Chief Trade con|&s;i&s;teth of Sugar, Ginger, and Hides of Oxen and Kine, bred here in infinite Numbers and of va&s;t bigne&s;s. Here al&s;o we had Plenty of &s;trong Wine, &s;weet Oyl, Vinegar, Olives, Excellent Wheat Meal packed up in Wine Pipes, Woollen and Linnen Cloath, Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="68">
all which were brought out of <HI>Spain.</HI> We found but little Plate, becau&s;e they u&s;e much <HI>China</HI> Wair.</P>
<P>Hence we put over to the <HI>Main</HI> Land, and came in &s;ight of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> &s;tanding hard by the Sea. The Harbor Mouth lyes 3 Miles We&s;tward from the Town, which we entred about 3 a Clock in the Afternoon. In the Evening we landed near the Harbor Mouth, under the Leading of our Lieut. Gen. and afterwards about Midnight mar|ched forwards ea&s;ily, keeping clo&s;e by the Sea &s;ide. But as we came within 2 Miles of the Town, their Hor&s;emen met us, and taking the Alarm, retired upon the fir&s;t Vol|ley of our &s;hot.</P>
<P>At this time we heard &s;ome Pieces of Ar|tillery di&s;charged, with &s;mall &s;hot towards the Harbor, whereby we under&s;tood, that, according to our Generals order the Night before, the Vice-Admiral, with Captain <HI>Venner,</HI> and <HI>White,</HI> and <HI>Cra&s;s</HI> &amp;c. with Boats and Pinnaces did attacque the little Fort on the Entry of the inner Haven, though to &s;mall purpo&s;e. In which attempt the Vice-Admiral had the Rudder of his Skiff &s;hot through.</P>
<P>The Troops being now in their March half a Mile this &s;ide the Town, the Ground grew &s;treight having the Main Sea on one
<PB N="130" REF="69">
&s;ide, and the Harbour on the other. This &s;treight was fortifyed with a &s;tone Wall, and Ditch. There was only &s;o much unwalled, as might &s;erve for pa&s;&s;age, and that was well Barricado'd. This Wall had 6 great Pieces planted on it, which &s;hot directly on our Front. On the inner &s;ide of the Streight, they had brought 2 Gallies to the Shore, where|in they placed 11 Pieces of Ordnance and 400 &s;mall &s;hot, which Flanked our coming on, and on the Land &s;ide in the Guard only of this place 300 &s;hot and Pikes. They di&s;charged many &s;hot both great and &s;mall, but our Lieut. Gen. approached by the lowe&s;t ground, &s;o that mo&s;t of their &s;hot was in vain; he al&s;o forbid us to &s;hoot till we were come to the Wall &s;ide. The fir&s;t place we came to was the Barricado's, where we di&s;|charged our &s;hot ju&s;t on our Enemies Faces, and joyned with them, and made them quickly retire; Our Lieut. Gen. &s;lew the Chief En&s;ign Bearer of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> We followed them into the Town, and won the Mercate place. At every Streets End they had made Barricado's, but we quickly took them with &s;mall lo&s;s. They had &s;et <HI>Indians</HI> in &s;everal corners with poy&s;oned Arrows; they had al&s;o &s;tuck &s;mall &s;ticks &s;harply poin|ted, and poy&s;oned, in the ground in our way; but we coming clo&s;e by the &s;hore &s;hunned mo&s;t of them.</P>

We &s;tayed here 6 Weeks, and the Sickne&s;s afore&s;aid &s;till continued; Few e&s;caping, and tho&s;e that did e&s;cape, &s;carce ever recovered their &s;trength, or their wits; &s;o that when any &s;poke fooli&s;hly, it was u&s;ual to &s;ay he had been &s;ick of a Calenture; The cau&s;e of it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Evening Air (they term it <HI>La Serena)</HI> which they &s;ay produces this di&s;temper to any then abroad who is not a Native. By rea&s;on hereof we gave over our de&s;ign for <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> where all the Trea&s;ure was, and thought of returning home.</P>
<P>While we were here one day our Watch e&s;pied 2 &s;mall Barks at Sea making towards the Harbor; Whereupon Capt. <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Varney</HI> with others embarqued them&s;elves in 2 Pinnaces; that they might take them be|fore they knew of our being there; but they having notice of it ran them&s;elves a&s;hore, and the men hid them&s;elves in Bu&s;hes: Our men immediatly boarded them, and were &s;uddenly &s;hot at by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> out of the Bu&s;hes; whereby Capt. <HI>Varney</HI> died pre&s;ently, and Capt. <HI>Moon</HI> died of his Wounds &s;ome days after; and &s;o we returned di&s;appointed, having had but few men, far inferior to them in Number.</P>
<P>In this time diver&s;e Courte&s;ies pa&s;t be|tween the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and us, and among

<P>We began to fire this City as we had done others, but at la&s;t they ran&s;omed it for 110000 Duckets. A far greater Ran&s;om than <HI>Domingo,</HI> becau&s;e it is a Place of grea|ter Traffique (whereas the other is chiefly inhabited by Lawyers and Gentlemen, being the chiefe&s;t Court of Judicature of the I&s;lands about it.) Yet having warning of our coming they had carried away their Trea&s;ure and principal Sub&s;tance. The Ran&s;om afore&s;aid being only mentioned for the Town, on payment thereof we left it, and drew part of our Souldiers into the Abby a quarter of a Mile below the Town, on the Harbor. Whereupon they offered us a Ran&s;om for the Abby and the Ca&s;tle on the Mouth of the Harbor; and when we asked alike for both; they proffered us 1000 Crowns for the Abby, and to di&s;po&s;e of the Ca&s;tle as we plea&s;ed; and therefore we delivered them the Abby, and blew up the Ca&s;tle, and &s;o departed to our Ships, which in the mean while were making all preparations for their Voyage. This I&s;land is very fruitful, bearing many plea&s;ant Fruits; it is but 2 or 3 Miles about. After 6 Weeks &s;tay here we put to Sea, and 2 or 3 days after our Ship we had taken at <HI>St. Do|mingo,</HI> fell into a great leak, and lo&s;t Com|pany

After 3 days we departed, and touched no where, but coa&s;ted along <HI>Florida,</HI> and <HI>May</HI> 28. we &s;aw a place, on the Shore built like a Beacon in 30 deg. We manned our Pinnaces, and went a&s;hore, and marched up the River &s;ide, to &s;ee what place the Enemy held, our General marched with the Com|panies, the Lieut. Gen. led the Vantguard, and when we had gone a Mile, we &s;aw a Fort on the other &s;ide the River, built by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and a little Town without Walls 3 Miles above it. We prepared Ordnance for the Battery, and about Evening our Lieut. Gen. &s;hot off a Piece, which &s;troke through their En&s;ign. In the Night the Lieut. Gen. took a little Rowing Skiff, and 12 men well Armed, as Capt. <HI>Morgan, Samp&s;on,</HI> and

others, to view what Guard the Enemy kept; the Enemy &s;eeng him come, took the Alarm, and being fearful, that all our Force was coming, abandoned the Place when they had &s;hot off &s;ome Pieces. Where|of a <HI>Frenchman</HI> (a Pri&s;oner) informed us; Thereupon our Gen. and Lieut. Gen. with &s;ome Souldiers, put over to the Fort. In our approach &s;ome that &s;tayed behind &s;hot off 2 Pieces; yet we entred, finding no man there. We found here 14 great Pieces of Bra&s;s Ordnance, and of Money to the Value of 2000 l. Next day we e&s;&s;ayed to go to the Town, but could not by rea&s;on of Rivers and broken ground, and therefore were forced to go up the River in our Pinnaces. When we approached the Land, they di&s;|charged &s;ome &s;hot on us, and pre&s;ently with|drew.

<L>Regnis juncturus Sceptra Britanna &s;uis.</L>
<L>Tanti hujus rogitas quae motus cau&s;a? &s;uperbos</L>
<L>Impulit Ambitio, vexat avariti&agrave;.</L>
<L>Quam bene te Ambitio mer&s;it vani&s;&s;ima ventus;</L>
<L>Et tumidae tumidos Vos &s;upera&s;tis aquae!</L>
<L>Quam bene Raptores Orbis totius Iberos</L>
<L>Mer&s;it inexhau&s;ti ju&s;ta vorago Maris!</L>
<L>At tu, cui venti, cui totum militat Aequor,</L>
<L>Regina, O mundi totius una decus:</L>
<L>Sic regnare Deo perge, Ambitione remota,</L>
<L>Prodiga &s;ic opibus perge juvare pios,</L>
<L>Ut te Angli longum, longum Anglis ip&s;a fruaris,</L>
<L>Quam dilecta bonis, tam metuenda malis.</L>
