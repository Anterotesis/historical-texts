<P>THe <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tow</HI> touching here homewards bound, brought &s;afe tho&s;e Commodities I gave you the trouble to &s;end me, and enricht me with the Trea&s;ure of your more welcome Letter; To which though I cannot An&s;wer in the &s;ame hand&s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions and Embroidery of Language (a failure ea&s;ily excu&s;able in a place where my Native Tongue is almo&s;t a &s;tranger, and <HI>French</HI> generally &s;po|ken more barbarous then that of <HI>Littleton</HI>) yet be confident I &s;hall never when opportunity offers it &s;elf come &s;hort in the real offices of Good-will and Affection; I am glad &s;ome of our old Acquaintance are &s;till &s;o kind as to pre&s;erve me in their memories, And could not but call <HI>Ned</HI> and <HI>Jenny</HI> to help laugh at the plea&s;ant Narration you make of the &s;urprize many of them are in, when you tell them I have left <HI>South-hampton</HI> to go dwell in the I&s;le of <HI>SERKE;</HI> Some inquiring in which of the <HI>Indies</HI> that &s;trange I&s;land lies, others offering wagers there is no &s;uch place in the World, but that it is younger Si&s;ter to the I&s;le of <HI>Pines;</HI> Nor indeed can I condemn their wonder &s;ince although this place hath for about four&s;core years paid obedience to the <HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h</HI> Scepter, yet &s;carce one <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> of a thou&s;and hath heard or can give any good Accompt of it; our Geographers have herein proved Land-Lopers, and the very Mapps wherein oftimes Painters gratifie their Wives with Joinctures of Imaginary I&s;lands, have been content to omit the real one; However to &s;ati&s;fie the curio&s;ity of my Friends, but more e&s;pecially to comply with your de&s;ires (which I mu&s;t ever interpret commands) I &s;hall venture on a brief De&s;cription of this little part of the World where Providence hath alotted me a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, and (I thank Heaven) no uncomfortable Habitation;</P>
<P><HI>SERKE</HI> the place whence this Letter comes to Ki&s;s your hands Is an I&s;land &s;cituate in the Channel betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> Lying at once in view of the Banks of <HI>Norm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ndy,</HI> and of our Two other more e|minent I&s;lands of <HI>Jer&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> and about 4 Leagues to the South|we&s;t of the latter; Though its Circuit or Extent can yeild no great Temptation to any Princes ambition to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, Its Dimen&s;ions being not above 5 miles in length, and about 2 miles in fredth where it is large&s;t over, in other places not &s;o much; Yet Nature, as if &s;he had here &s;tored up &s;ome extraordinary Trea&s;ure &s;eems to have been very &s;olicitous to render it Impregnable, Being on every &s;ide &s;urrounded
<PB N="2" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->with va&s;t Rocks and mighty Clifts, who&s;e craggy Tops Braving the Clouds with their &s;tupendious height, bid defiance to All that &s;hall dream of forcing an entrance; Two only A&s;cents or pa&s;&s;ages there are into it; The fir&s;t where all Goods and Commodities are received called <HI>La-Soguien</HI> where for a large &s;pace through a &s;olid Rock there is a Cart-way cut by Art down to the Sea, with two &s;trong Gates for its defence, wherein mo&s;t of the Storage for Navigation, as Ma&s;ts, Sails, Anchors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> belonging to the I&s;land are kept, And two pieces of Ordinance above al|ways ready planted to prevent any &s;urprize; The other is <HI>La-Frickerce,</HI> where only Pa&s;&s;angers can Land, climbing up a Rock by certain Steps or Stairs cut therein to a va&s;t height, and &s;omewhat dangerou&s;ly; Nor is it po&s;&s;ible there for above one per&s;on to come up at once.</P>
<P>This De&s;cription of its Scituation I per&s;wade my &s;elf, Cozen puts you unto a little fit of longing to know by what means our Country-men came at fir&s;t to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ter of a place &s;o naturally fortified; And truly in di&s;covering that, we &s;hall acquaint you with a &s;tratagem excel|ling mo&s;t you &s;hall meet with in the Greek and Roman Hi&s;tories and e|qualled by few of tho&s;e in the Low Countrey Wars, or any more mo|dern expeditions.</P>
<P>In the Reign of our matchle&s;s Maiden Queen, this I&s;land being wholly po&s;&s;e&s;t by <HI>French</HI> (as mo&s;t of the Inhabitants not only thereof but of <HI>Jer|&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> too, are to this day of that Nation) A Sea-Captain (who&s;e name I at pre&s;ent remember not, though tis pitty it ever &s;hould be &s;wallowed by oblivion) apprehending Its neighbour-hood if it continu|ed in the <HI>French</HI> hands might one time or other portend no good to the I&s;les of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> the only remaining Trophies of our <HI>French Conque&s;ts;</HI> &s;olicited the Queen to Commi&s;&s;ion him to reduce it to her o|bedience, who having received former Information of it, told him the place was &s;o &s;mall and the attempt &s;o hazardous it would &s;carce be worth while, and that &s;he feared the lo&s;s of Men about it would be more da|mage, than its taking of Importance or advantage; For you mu&s;t note at that time the pa&s;&s;age down at <HI>La-Soguien</HI> was not made, nor did it appear half &s;o Acce&s;&s;ible as now it appears; But our &s;ubtle Captain replyed. If Her Maje&s;ty would but give him Command and nece&s;&s;aries he dur&s;t a&s;&s;ure Her to &s;ettle the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colours there without the lo&s;s of a Man; The Queen &s;eeing his confidence yeilded to his Importunity, who accompanied with a|bout 100 re&s;olved Men puts to Sea, and after &s;ome time cru&s;ing up and down comes and lies before this I&s;land <HI>SERKE</HI> in quality of a Mer|chant-man homewards bound; And making out his Boat with &s;everal taking
<PB N="3" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->Commodities the people &s;uffered 3 or 4 of their Crew to Land, and traded with them with much Amity for a day or two. At la&s;t having in&s;inuated into the good opinion of the credulous I&s;landers They told them having been a long Trading Voyage in the <HI>Streights</HI> their Ma&s;ter was &s;ome time &s;ince dead, but had engaged them not to expo&s;e his Corps into the Ocean to be devoured of the Fi&s;h, but to Interr it with Chri&s;tian Burial in the next place where they &s;hould touch ground, and therefore they de&s;ired that Chri&s;tian favour of them that they might lay him in their Church-yard, coming only &s;ome few of them on Shore without any Arms to perform the Ceremony; The unwary people con&s;ent, and our Captain with about 20 of his &s;toure&s;t Men with a Coffin and much &s;eeming &s;olemnity get a Shore; The Natives a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to get their <HI>Trojan</HI> Hor&s;e up the Precipice; but no &s;ooner were they arrived at the Church, but clapping to the Doors as if they had &s;ome private devotions to celebrate at which the inhabitants might not be pre&s;ent, They break open their Coffin filled in&s;tead of a dead body with In&s;truments of Death, and in&s;tantly arming them&s;elves &s;lay that &s;mall <HI>French</HI> Guard that there offered re&s;i&s;tance, and retiring to the Landing place &s;ecure that, get in more of their company, and in 5 hours time without the lo&s;s of one Man, made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the whole I&s;land, which ever &s;ince that time has had the Honour to boa&s;t it &s;elf part of the Domini|ons of the Engli&s;h Crown.</P>
<P>But &s;ince nothing is more nece&s;&s;ary to the Life of Man, than tho&s;e four Elements whereof He together with the re&s;t of the Univer&s;e is originally compo&s;ed. I &s;hall in the next place ob&s;erve how we are therewith ac|comodated.</P>
<P>Our Air con&s;idering the narrowne&s;s of the place, and how 'tis encompa&s;&s;ed with the Ocean Is much better then can be expected, our Heaven &s;erene, and our Sky generally free from that na&s;ty di&s;h-clout of Fogs and Clouds which in your Mari&s;hes and City too are wont to mufflle up the Suns glo|rious face, In brief tis &s;o agreeable to nature, That although I know not one Phy&s;itian in the I&s;land (and perhaps we live the longer for their ab&s;ence) yet to meet here a hearty old man of four&s;core is nothing rare or infrequent.</P>
<P>Our water I confe&s;s is &s;ometimes not very ready, and yet we have in the I&s;land no le&s;s than &s;ix very fine &s;prings generally running, Who&s;e water pu|rified in its under-ground pa&s;&s;age, and by being drawn &s;o high through Na|tures Limbeck, Bubbles up &s;o free from any &s;mack of Bracki&s;hne&s;s, that it may compare with your Lambs-Conduit, and for ought I know is no le&s;s miraculous for curing &s;ore Eyes than <HI>Crowders</HI> Well.</P>
<P>Our Earth or Soil Is for the mo&s;t part hot and &s;andy, yet fruitful enough
<PB N="4" REF="5"><!-- PDF PAGE 113 -->to afford all nece&s;&s;eries to its Inhabitants, excellent for bearing all kind of Roots, As Par&s;neps, Carrots; Turneps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And very well &s;tored with fruit-trees (for the mo&s;t part planted of late by the good Husbandry of the people) Furni&s;hing us with Syder not at all inferiour to your <HI>Hereford&s;hire</HI> Red&s;treak, and to render it the more whole&s;ome tis generally boyled with a little &s;pice, which pre&s;erves it and gives it an incomparable Relli&s;h; Corn we have of mo&s;t &s;orts, but not in any extraordinary quantity; our pa&s;ture is but &s;hort yet exceeding &s;weet and therefore we have rare Mutton, but no great plenty of Beef, and Cows only enow to &s;upply us with Milk and Butter, for our Chee&s;e we have generally from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Our Fireing (to &s;peak of the mo&s;t a&s;piring Element la&s;t) Is for the mo&s;t part Furzes and &s;ometimes Turf, For we have but little wood, and no Tim|ber at all growing throughout the whole I&s;land; &s;o that we are forced either to make &s;hift with old Apple-tree for our Hou&s;es, or furni&s;h our &s;elves as well as we can with Deal.</P>
<P>For Belly-timber our 3 &s;taple Commodities are Fi&s;h, Fowl and Rabbets. Of the fir&s;t a little Indu&s;try will purcha&s;e us a hundred &s;orts, particularly a large Fi&s;h we call a Vrack-fi&s;h which we &s;plit, and nailing it to our Walls dry it in the Sun for part of our Winter provi&s;ion; As al&s;o a large &s;hel-fi&s;h taken plentifully at Low-tides called an Ormond that &s;ticks to the Rocks, whence we beat them off with a Fo&s;el or Iron hook; Tis much bigger then an Oy&s;ter, and like that good either fre&s;h or pickled; but infinitely more plea&s;ant to the Gu&s;to, &s;o that an epicure would think his pallat in Paradice if he might but always gormondize on &s;uch delitious <HI>Ambro&s;ia,</HI> To borrow <HI>Aretines</HI> phra&s;e upon his eating a Lamprey.</P>
<P>For Fowl your City cannot be better furni&s;ht with Wood-cocks or Widgeons, be&s;ides the abundance of Duck, Mallard, Teal and other wild|fowl, with Clift-Pidgeons with which at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons almo&s;t the whole I&s;land is covered.</P>
<P>Of Conies we have every where exceeding plenty, and yet lea&s;t we &s;hould want, nature has provided us a particular Warren, placing at a &s;mall di&s;tance in the Sea an I&s;land of about half a mile every way over, which is inhabited by nothing el&s;e whether we commonly go a Ferreting and have thence &s;uch abundance that it has been confidently told me &s;ome Families here have made 15 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">0 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year only of their Skins; If all this rich fare will not content you, we have a mo&s;t excellent Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">tage made of Milk Ba|con, Coleworts, Mackerel and Goo&s;eberries boyled together all to pieces, which our Mode Is to eat, not with the ceremony of a &s;poon, but the more Courtly way of a great piece of bread furiou&s;ly plying between your mouth and the Kettle.</P>

<P>But lea&s;t you &s;hould think we mind too much our Bellies take next a &s;urvey of our political Government fir&s;t for our defence we have a Captain with about 40 Souldiers, who continually keep Guard, and are maintained by contribution of the Inhabitants; Then we have a Court of Judicature held every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> where an hone&s;t Fi&s;herman we call the Judge, Another (at pre&s;ent his Son) that is intituled Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Prove&s;t,</HI> a Per&s;on that has the gift of writing, and learning enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o read the Obligation of a Bond, &s;erving as Clerk or Recorder, with 5 other &s;age Burgers that are Ju&s;tices or &s;ome of them meet, and without any tedious formalities, Intricate De|murrers, &s;pecial Verdicts, wiredrawn Arguments, chargable Injunctions, multiplyed Motions, or endle&s;s Writs of Error, briskly determine all cau|&s;es <HI>Secundum Aequum &amp; bonum</HI> according to their Mother-wit and grave di&s;cretions except in Criminals where Life is concerned, in which ca&s;e the offenders are immediately &s;ent away for tryal and puni&s;hment to <HI>Guern&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>Since the taking the place by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hugenote Mini&s;ters officiating, the people have &s;ub&s;cribed to the Di&s;cipline which beyond the Seas They call Reformed, But wanting much of that beauty and decent order where|with the Church of <HI>England</HI> entertains her Children, The pre&s;ent Mini&s;ter (whom I mu&s;t acknowledge a per&s;on of more Indu&s;try and parts than could be hoped for among &s;uch people) hath lately begun Teach Grammar to the Children with Writing and Arithmetick, erecting a School for that pur|po&s;e, &s;o that who knows to that prodigious Learning we may here one day arrive? Sure I am, the genius of the people cannot but be docible, &s;ince they are naturally of a courteous affable temper, and the lea&s;t tainted with Pride that ever I &s;aw any any of their Nation; That api&s;h variety of fan|ta&s;tick fa&s;hions wherewith <HI>Paris</HI> is ju&s;tly accu&s;ed to infect all <HI>Europe,</HI> has here no footing; where every one retains the &s;ame garb their Ance&s;tors wore in the days of <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> and King <HI>Pippin,</HI> &s;o that I can give &s;mall encouragement to any of the Knights of the Thimble to tran&s;port them|&s;elves hither, where Cucumbers are like to be more plenty than in the back|&s;ide of St. <HI>Clements;</HI> Each man religiou&s;ly pre&s;erving his va&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">lew Trunk Breeches with a Cod-peice larger than King <HI>Harry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> and a Coat almo&s;t like a Dutch Froes Ve&s;t, or one of your Watermens Liveries; Nor are the Women behind hand with them in their Ho&s;pital gowns of the &s;ame colour Wooden &s;andalls, white Stockings, and Red Petticoats &s;o mean they are &s;carce worth taking up; Both Sexes on Fe&s;tivals were large Ruffs and the Women in&s;tead of Hats or Hoods Tru&s;s up there hair, The more Gentile &s;ort in a kind of Cabbidge-net, tho&s;e of meaner Fortunes in a peice of Lin|nen perhaps an old di&s;h-clout turn'd out of &s;ervice, or the fagg end of a
