<HEAD>A Declaration of the furious Out-rages of FRANCE, with the &s;laughter of the Admirall.</HEAD>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed that the memory of fre&s;h &s;laughters, and of that butcherly murthering that hath lately been committed in a manner in all the Towns of <HI>France,</HI> were utterly put out of the minds of men: For &s;o great di&s;honour, and &s;o great infamy hath thereby &s;tayned the whole French Nation, that the mo&s;t part of them are now a&s;hamed of their own Country, defiled with two mo&s;t filthy &s;pots, fal&s;e-hood and cruelty; of the which, whether hath been the greater it is hard to &s;ay. But fora&s;much as there flie every where abroad pamphlets written by flatterers of the Court, and men corruptly hired for reward, which do mo&s;t &s;hamefully &s;et out things fay|ned and fal&s;ly imagined, in&s;tead of truth, I thought my &s;elf bound to do this &s;ervice to po&s;terity, to put the matter in writing as it was truely done indeed, being wel enabled to have knowledge thereof, both by mine own calamity, and by tho&s;e that with their own eyes beheld a great part of the &s;ame &s;laughter.</P>
<P>In the yeer of our Lord, 1561, when there &s;eemed to be &s;ome perill of troubles to ari&s;e by rea&s;on of the multitude of &s;uch as embraced the Religion (which they call reformed (for before that time the u&s;uall manner of puni&s;hing &s;uch as dur&s;t profe&s;&s;e that Religion, was, be&s;ides lo&s;&s;e and forfeiture of all their goods to the Kings u&s;e, to burn their bodies) at the reque&s;t of the great Lords and Nobility, there was holden an A&s;&s;embly of the E&s;tates, in the Kings hou&s;e at Saint <HI>Germains</HI> in <HI>Lay,</HI> neer to the Town of <HI>Paris;</HI> at which A&s;&s;embly, in pre&s;ence, and with the Royall A&s;&s;ent of King <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, which now raigneth, it was decreed, That from thenceforth it &s;hould not be prejudiciall to any man to profe&s;&s;e the &s;aid Religion, And that it &s;hould be lawfull for them to have publique meetings and preachings for the exerci&s;e thereof, but in the &s;uburbs of Towns only.</P>
<P>At this a&s;&s;embly, <HI>Francis</HI> Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> being de&s;cended of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lorain,</HI> and at that time grand Ma&s;ter of the Kings Hou&s;hold, was not pre&s;ent. But when he was in|formed of this Decree, he boyled with incredible &s;orrow and anger, and within few dayes after, at a little Town in <HI>Campagne,</HI> called <HI>Va&s;&s;ey,</HI> while the profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;aid Reli|gion were there at a Sermon, he, accompanied with a Band of Souldiers, &s;et upon them, and &s;lew men and women to the number of two hundred.</P>
<P>There was among the&s;e of the Religion (for &s;o hereafter, according to the u&s;uall phra&s;e of the French tongue we intend to call them) <HI>Lewes</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> of the Blood royal, common|ly called the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> after the name of a certain Town, a man of great power, by rea&s;on of his kindred to the King. Therefore when the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> mo&s;t vehe, mently &s;trived again&s;t that Law, and as much as in him lay did utterly overthrow it, and troubled the common quiet thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>Ga&s;per de Coligni,</HI> Admirall of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Francis d' Andelot</HI> his brother, Captain of the <HI>Fantarie,</HI> and other Princes, Noble|men, and Gentlemen of the &s;ame Religion, came daily by heaps to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> to complain of the outragious boldne&s;&s;e, and untemperate violence of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>At that time <HI>Catherine de Medices,</HI> Pope <HI>Clements</HI> brothers daughter, and mother of
<PB N="4" REF="3"> King <HI>Charles,</HI> born in <HI>Florence,</HI> a City of <HI>Italy,</HI> had the governance of the Realm in the Kings Minority. For though by the Law of <HI>France,</HI> neither the Inheritance, nor the Ad|mini&s;tration of the Realm is granted to women, yet through the cowardly negligence of <HI>Anthony</HI> King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Katherine de Medices,</HI> the Kings mother, again&s;t the cu&s;tome of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e Realm, was joyned with him in that Office of protector&s;hip. She fear|ing the pre&s;umption and fierce pride of the <HI>Gui&s;ans,</HI> wrote to the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with her own Hand: which Letters are yet remaining, and at the A&s;&s;embly of the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> at <HI>Franchford,</HI> holden under <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Emperour, were produced, and open|ly read about ten yeers pa&s;t; wherein &s;he earne&s;tly be&s;ought him, in &s;o great hardne&s;&s;e and di&s;tre&s;&s;e, not to for&s;ake her, but to account both the mother and the children, that is, both h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r &s;elf and the King, and the Kings B ethren, committed to his faith and naturall kindene&s;&s;e, and that he &s;hould with all &s;peed provide for their common &s;afety: a&s;&s;uring him, That &s;he would &s;o imprint in the Kings minde his travell taken in that behalf, that he &s;hould never be lo&s;er by it.</P>
<P>Within few dayes after, the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> well knowing how great authority the name of the King would carry in <HI>France;</HI> and to the intent that he would not &s;eem to at|tempt any thing rather of his own head, than the priuity of the King; and hauing attain|ed fit partners to joyn with him in the&s;e enterpri&s;es, he got the King into his power. Which thing known abroad, and many hard encombrances thereupon &s;uddenly ri&s;ing, and a great part of the Nobility of <HI>France</HI> marvellou&s;ly troubled with it, the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> by advice of his friends, thought it be&s;t to take certain Towns, and furni&s;h them with gari&s;ons; which was the beginning of the fir&s;t civill warre. For the prince of <HI>Conde</HI> alleaged the cau&s;e of his taking armour, to be the defence of the Kings Edict, wherein con&s;i&s;ted the &s;afety of the Common-weal, and that it could not be repealed without mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured undoing of the Nation of <HI>France,</HI> and de&s;truction of the Nobility, by rea&s;on of the exceeding great multitude of tho&s;e that dayly joyned them&s;elves to that Religion. Of which number &s;uch as being of Noble Birth, were in power, dignity, wealth, and credit above the re&s;t, thought it not meet for them to &s;uffer the puni&s;hments and cruelty accu&s;tomed to be extended upon the profe&s;&s;ors thereof, be&s;ide that, they held them di&s;con|tented, that the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> a new-come &s;tranger, tran&s;lated from the Forre&s;ts of <HI>Lo|rain</HI> into France, did take upon him in <HI>France</HI> &s;o great courage, and &s;o high dominion and power. Thereto was added the Queen-mothers &s;ingular care (as was reported) for con|&s;ervation of peace, and repre&s;&s;ing the rage of the <HI>Gui&s;ans.</HI> Upon which opinion it is cer|tain, That above twenty thou&s;and men having regard onely to the Queens inclination, joyned them&s;elves to the &s;ide of tho&s;e of the Religion, and to the defence of their profe&s;|&s;ion, which at that time had be&s;ieged the force of the Kings power.</P>
<P>After certain Battels, and many lo&s;&s;es on both parts, and the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> &s;lain, with|in a yeer peace was made, with this condition, That they of the Religion &s;hould have free Liberty thereof, and &s;hould have a&s;&s;emblies and preachings for the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame in certain places.</P>
<P>This peace continued in force, but not in all places, during five yeers: for in the mo&s;t Towns and Juri&s;dictions, the Officers that were affectionate to the Romi&s;h &s;ide, whom they commonly call Catholikes, did all the di&s;plea&s;ures they could to tho&s;e of the Re|ligion. Therefore, when <HI>Ferdinando Alvares de Toledo,</HI> commonly called Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3"> was leading an Army not farre from the frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e of the <HI>Low-Countrey</HI> which embraced the reformed Religion, again&s;t the will of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Queen-mother cau&s;ed to be leavyed and brought into <HI>France</HI> &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Switzers</HI> for a defence, as &s;he cau&s;ed it to be bruted; but as the &s;ucce&s;&s;e hath proved, for this intent, That the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Admirall, and other Noble men of the Reli|gion, if they e&s;caped the Trea&s;ons prepared for them, and li&s;ted to defend them&s;elves by fo ce, and try it by Battell, might be &s;uddenly oppre&s;&s;ed ere they were provided. For the Courtiers which then had the managing of the&s;e matters, did not at that time well tru&s;t the Souldiers of <HI>France.</HI> Many thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s pertayning to the cour&s;e of that time, and the renewing of the War, mu&s;t here for ha&s;te to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e be nece&s;&s;arily omitted.</P>
<P>When the War had endured about &s;ix months, peace was made with the &s;ame Condi|tions that we have above rehear&s;ed, That all men &s;hould have free liberty to follow and profe&s;&s;e the Religion reformed. For this was ever one and the la&s;t Condition upon all the Wars. But within few dayes or months after, it was plainly under&s;tood, that the &s;ame peace was full of guile and trea&s;on, and finally, That it was no peace, but mo&s;t cru|ell Warre, cloaked under the name of Peace. For forthwith all tho&s;e Towns which they of the Religion had yeelded up, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and &s;trengthened with Garri&s;ons of Souldiers of the contrary &s;ide, &s;aving onely one Town on the Sea-coa&s;t in the parts of <HI>Xantoigne</HI> commonly called <HI>Rochell.</HI> For the men of that Town about two hun|dred yeers pa&s;t, had yeelded them&s;elves to the Kings Power and Allegiance, with this Condition, That they &s;hould never be con&s;trayned again&s;t their will to receive any Gar|ri&s;on Souldiers.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the Admirall were adverti&s;ed, That there was Trea&s;on again prepared to entrap them by <HI>Tavagnes,</HI> a man given to murther and mi&s;chief, which had lately been made Mar&s;hall of <HI>France,</HI> and that if they did not &s;peedily avoid the &s;ame, it &s;hould &s;hortly come to pa&s;&s;e, that they &s;hould be deceived and taken by him, and delivered up to the cruelty of their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Upon the receit of the&s;e adverti&s;ements, they immediatly make ha&s;te to <HI>Rochell,</HI> car|rying with them their wives and young children, which was the beginning of the third Civill Warre, the mo&s;t &s;harp and mi&s;erable of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>There was at that time in the Court, <HI>Charles</HI> Cardinall of <HI>Lorain,</HI> brother to the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> which (as is above &s;aid) was &s;lain in the fir&s;t War; one accounted mo&s;t &s;ubtill and crafty of all the re&s;t, but of a terrible, cruell, and troubel&s;ome di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o as he was thought intollerable even at <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf. This man, they of the reformed Re|ligion reported to be the mo&s;t &s;harp and hatefull enemy of their profe&s;&s;ion, and him they abhorred above all other for the cruelty of his nature, and named him the fire-brand of all civill flames. He at the beginning of the third Civill Warre, per&s;waded the King to publi&s;h an Edict, That no man profe&s;&s;e any Religion but the Romi&s;h or Popi&s;h, and that who&s;oever would embrace any other, &s;hould be counted as Traytors. In that &s;ame Edict Printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> the &s;entence was expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ly contained, and for the &s;trangene&s;&s;e of the matter, and for that it &s;tained the Kings name with the mo&s;t di&s;honourable &s;pot of perjury, and breach of Faith, it was in other impre&s;&s;ions afterward omitted. And it was further then declared, That albeit the King had in many Edicts before that time permitted the freedome of Religion, yet his meaning ever was to
<PB N="6" REF="4"> retain and cau&s;e to be retained of all men, the onely Romi&s;h or popi&s;h Religion within his Realm.</P>
<P>After many overthrows on both parties given and received, whereas the end of this third War was thought likely to he harder, by rea&s;on of the breach of Faith in the yeers before, and on the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">her &s;ide the &s;tate of the Realm, by rea&s;on of the wa&s;te that the Ci|ties were brought unto, and the extreme poverty of the mean people, and husband|men, old require &s;ome Treaty of Compo&s;ition, the King &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to the Admi|rall, to &s;ignifie unto him in the Kings name, That the King h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;elf had at length found out a mo&s;t &s;ure way of peace and concord, namely, That the Armies of both parties joyned together, &s;hould go into the <HI>Low Countrey</HI> again&s;t the Duke of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">va,</HI> which had been the author of the late calamities in <HI>France.</HI> He &s;ignifieth further, That he had great cau&s;es of quarrels again&s;t the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and this principally, That he had invaded and held by force, &s;uddenly &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ying all the Souldiers there, an I&s;land of the new-found world, called <HI>Florida,</HI> which had been taken by the French King, and kept under his Do|minion; and likewi&s;e the Marque&s;dom of <HI>Finall,</HI> the inhabitants whereof had but a little time before yeelded th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;elves to the Kings &s;ubj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ction and allegiance. He &s;aid that the mo&s;t &s;tedfa&s;t band of concord &s;hould be that forraign War, and that there could no o|ther better mean be devi&s;ed to drown the memory of the former di&s;&s;entions in eternall forgetfulne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>To the performance whereof, he &s;aid it was a matter of mo&s;t apt opportunity, that <HI>Lodovic</HI> Count of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> Brother to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had been now two yeers in the Admirals Camp, to whom the Admirall gave principall credit in all things, and that by him and his fellows of the <HI>Low Countrey,</HI> and other whom he under&s;tood to favour his part, it might ea&s;ily be brought to pa&s;&s;e that certain Cities might be &s;urpri&s;ed, and thereby great advantage be attained to the atchieving of the War.</P>
<P>The Admirall hearing the&s;e things was marvellou&s;ly troubled. For albeit he doubt|ed not of the Kings fidelity, yet therewithall many things fell into his minde to be con&s;i|dered: as the power of the Cardinall, and the re&s;t of the <HI>Gui&s;ans,</HI> who were well known to have been at all times mo&s;t affectionate to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> For the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> had left a &s;on, a very young man, called <HI>Henry,</HI> to whom the Queen had given all the Of|fices and places of honour that his father had born before, being unfit thereto by age, and again&s;t the ancient Laws and Cu&s;tomes, and al&s;o through the trayterous infidelity of certain of the Kings Councellors, whom &s;he knew for their affection to popi&s;h Re|ligion, to be mo&s;t addicted to the Spani&s;h King, and that divers of them had great yeer|ly pen&s;ions of him, and did di&s;clo&s;e unto him the affairs of the Realm. He remembred how hereby it came to pa&s;&s;e, That the &s;ame Kings Amba&s;&s;adour (which among &s;trange Nations &s;eemed utterly incredible) was admitted into the privy Councell of <HI>France;</HI> and that one <HI>Biragio</HI> a <HI>Lumbard,</HI> and (as it is reported) a Traytor to his own Countrey, otherwi&s;e altogether unlearned, and &s;pecially ignorant of the Civill Law, was yet for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ubtilty of his wit advanced to &s;o great honour, that he executed the Chanc llors Office, <HI>Michael Ho&s;pitall</HI> being di&s;placed, a man known to be &s;uch a one, as there was not in all degrees of men, any eithermore wi&s;e, or more learned, or more zea|lou&s;ly loving his Countrey. Herewithall he con&s;idered the &s;landerous cavillations of
<PB N="7" REF="4"> his adver&s;aries, to whom hereby might &s;eem an occa&s;ion given, as if the Admirall were of a trouble&s;ome nature, and could not abide any quietne&s;&s;e, nor could long re&s;t at home without &s;ome tumultuous &s;tirre. Hereunto the me&s;&s;engers replyed as they were able, and therewithall alleadged this cau&s;e of &s;o &s;udden hatred again&s;t the Spani&s;h King, that one <HI>Albenie,</HI> late returned out of <HI>Spain,</HI> had informed the King, and the Queen-mother for certain, That King <HI>Philip</HI> a few months before, had poy&s;oned his wife the French Kings &s;i&s;ter, and had &s;pred many rumours of her thorowout all <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;uch as for the honour of many per&s;ons, are meet not to be di&s;clo&s;ed. But nothing moved the Admirall &s;o much as the cheerfull earne&s;tne&s;&s;e of <HI>Lodovic</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> who as &s;oon as he was adverti&s;ed of that purpo&s;e of the Kings, omitted nothing that he thought might &s;erve to encourage the Admirall thereunto.</P>
<P>The Admirall per&s;waded hereby, nothing fearing the infidelity of tho&s;e of the Court, gave his minde to hearken to Compo&s;ition. And &s;o was the third Civill War ended, and the peace concluded with the &s;ame Conditions that were before, That every man &s;hould have free liberty to u&s;e and profe&s;&s;e the Religion.</P>
<P>Within few months after this, divers Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> that favoured the Religi|on reformed, and among&s;t tho&s;e the three Electors, the Pal&s;egrave, the Duke of <HI>Saxo|ny,</HI> and the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> &s;ent their Amba&s;&s;adours into <HI>France,</HI> to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> King, to gratulate unto him for the new reconciliation of his &s;ubjects. And becau&s;e they accounted it greatly to behoove them&s;elves, that the &s;ame concord &s;hould remain &s;tedfa&s;t, and of long continuance, they promi&s;ed, That if any would for that cau&s;e pro|cure trouble, or make Warre upon him either within his own Dominions, or without, they and their followers &s;hould be ready to defend him. To this Amba&s;&s;age the King fir&s;t by words, and afterwards by a book, &s;ub&s;cribed with his own hand, an&s;wered, and gave his Faith, That he would for ever mo&s;t &s;acredly and faithfully ob&s;erve his Edict of Pacification.</P>
<P>Hereby &s;o much the more willingly the Admirall &s;uffered him&s;elf to be drawn to the &s;aid purpo&s;es for the <HI>Low-Countrey,</HI> although oftentimes calling to minde the nature of the Queenmother, he u&s;ed to &s;ay to divers, and e&s;pecially to <HI>Theligny,</HI> to whom he after|ward married his daughter, That he greatly &s;u&s;pected the rolling wit of that woman. For (&s;aid he) &s;o &s;oon as &s;he hath brought us into that preparation again&s;t the <HI>Low-Coun|trey,</HI> &s;he will leave us in the mid&s;t.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;&s;e, the Count of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> writeth to his brother, and they conferring their advices together, &s;end Me&s;&s;engers to the King, That if it plea&s;e him to deal with the matter of the <HI>Low-Countrey;</HI> they will &s;hortly &s;o do, that he &s;hall by their many and great &s;ervices, well perceive their affection and devotion toward him. The King wri|teth again to them in mo&s;t loving tearms, &s;aying, That their Me&s;&s;age mo&s;t highly plea|&s;ed him, and he gave to them both his hearty thanks.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperour, pitying the &s;tate of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (as he &s;aid) treated by his Amba&s;&s;adours with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had in manner obtained that the Prince &s;hould have all his goods re&s;tored unto him; but with this C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ndition, That he &s;hould have no hou&s;e within the Territory of the <HI>Low Country;</HI> but &s;etling his re&s;idence and dwelling el&s;ewhere, he &s;hould freely enjoy all his Reve|nues. Which matter being reported to the French King, he immediately &s;ent Me&s;&s;en|gers
<PB N="8" REF="5"> to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> willing him to look for nothing by that dealing of the Emperour, &s;aying that it was but a fraud and guilfull device, intended for this purpo&s;e, Only to break up his leavying of Souldiers that he had begun in <HI>Germany,</HI> and a&s;&s;uring him, That if he would credit and follow him, he would give him ayd &s;ufficient to reco|ver his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> per&s;waded by the&s;e promi&s;es of King <HI>Charles,</HI> continued his Mu&s;tering, and determined a while to bear the charges, though they were heavy to him, while &s;uch things as were nece&s;&s;ary for the War were in preparing. In the mean time <HI>Lodovic,</HI> in di&s;gui&s;ed apparell, went to <HI>Paris</HI> to the King, Fora&s;much as the &s;ea&s;on of the yeer by this time &s;eemed not commodious to leavy an Army, for the winter was at hand, by a&s;&s;ent they deferred the matter till the next Summer.</P>
<P>The&s;e things thus hanging, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his Captains by Sea, did oftentimes &s;et upon the Spaniards and Portugalls, and &s;uch Ships as they took, they brought into the Haven of <HI>Rochell,</HI> which then was in the power of the Prince of <HI>Condees</HI> part; and there they openly uttered and &s;old their prizes to the men of the Town, and other Mer|chants of <HI>France,</HI> whereupon the Amba&s;&s;adour of <HI>Spain</HI> made often complaints to the Kings Privy Councell.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as they thought it very available to this enterpri&s;e, that <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Queen of <HI>England</HI> might be brought into league with them, the King committed the dealing in that matter to the Admirall. For, a few months before, the King had with mo&s;t &s;weet alluring Letters, gotten him to the Court, where he was mo&s;t honourably enter|tained: and to take from him all occa&s;ion of di&s;tru&s;t upon his adver&s;aries, or of other|wi&s;e &s;u&s;pecting of the Kings, or Queen-mothers affection to him, fir&s;t, all the <HI>Gui&s;ans</HI> of a &s;et purpo&s;e departed the Court. Then the King gave the Admirall free liberty to take with him &s;uch company, and with what furniture he would: and becau&s;e it was thought that he had more confidence in the Mar&s;hall Co&s;&s;e, then in the re&s;t, therefore the King commanded the &s;aid Mar&s;hall to be ever at hand with the Admirall, and to a&s;|&s;i&s;t him in the Kings name, if any need were.</P>
<P>The matter of the league with <HI>England,</HI> the Admirall &s;o diligently and indu&s;triou&s;ly handled, that within &s;hort &s;pace after, by the Amba&s;&s;adours a&s;&s;ent, and by faith given and received, and Oaths &s;olemnly taken on both parts, it was confirmed. Concerning the procurement of other Leagues and Amities, &s;uch as might &s;eem to further the enter|pri&s;e of the <HI>Low Countrey,</HI> the Admirall al&s;o travelled in the Kings name, and by his commandment, and had in a manner brought all the&s;e things to an end. And of all tho&s;e Leagues, the fir&s;t and principall condition was, That the liberty of Religion &s;hould continue, and that the King &s;hould mo&s;t diligently and &s;incerely ob&s;erve this Edict of Pacification.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e things &s;eemed to be handled &s;ecretly, yet by the Letters both of <HI>Biragio</HI> the Vice-chancellor, of whom we made mention before, and of <HI>Morvil|liers,</HI> whom from his hypocriticall leanne&s;&s;e children commonly called the Chimera or bugge of the Court, and by adverti&s;ements of Cardinall <HI>de Pelve,</HI> a man mo&s;t fit, either to invent or execute any Trea&s;on, they were carryed to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> who by advice of his Cardinalls, &s;ent by and by one of their number, called <HI>Alexandrine,</HI> in the mid&s;t of mo&s;t &s;harp Winter into <HI>France,</HI> with the&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="5"> in&s;tructions to per&s;wade the King to enter into the &s;ociety of the league of <HI>Trent,</HI> whe e|of the fir&s;t and principall Article was, That the Confederates &s;hould joyn their pow rs and make warre upon the Turks and Hereticks, meaning by the name of Heretic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, all tho&s;e Princes that did permit the u&s;e of the reformed Religion, within their Domi|nions.</P>
<P>The Cardinall <HI>Alexandrine</HI> was honourably received in the Court, but yet di&s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed without atchieving his purpo&s;e. For &s;o was it bruted among the People, and comm nly beleeved throughout <HI>France:</HI> Albeit, he him&s;elf &s;ecretly &s;eemed to return very mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y and cheerfull to the Pope; and as it is reported, did &s;ometime &s;ay, That he received &s;uch an&s;wer of the King as was needfull, not to be publi&s;hed, And that the King and Queen-Mother had largely &s;atisfied him.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much, As it was thought a matter greatly availing to the enterpri&s;e of the Low-Countrey, to &s;end certain Ships into the Engli&s;h Seas; That if any ayde &s;hould be &s;ent into the Low. Countrey to the Duke of <HI>Alv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> out of <HI>Spain,</HI> it might &s;o be &s;topped, <HI>Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">zzi</HI> and the <HI>Baron de la Guarde</HI> were appointed for that purpo&s;e, to whom the King gave in Commandment to Rigge forth certain Ships of <HI>Burdeaux</HI> and <HI>Rochell,</HI> well Armed and well appointed, and to provide with all &s;peed all things needfull for tho&s;e Ships. The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mewhat moved with this preparation, made divers complaints to the Kings Coun&s;ell, on the behalf of the King his Ma&s;ter, and yet never received any other An&s;wer, But that the King thought it not likely, and that he would &s;end Commi&s;&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ers to <HI>Burdeaux</HI> and to <HI>Rochell,</HI> with Letters and Commandment, that there &s;hould be no preparation made to the Sea, and if any had been made, it &s;hould be enquired of. What in&s;tructions were &s;ecretly and clo&s;ely under hand given to the&s;e two Captains of that Navy, we do not certainly know. But this no man can doubt of, But that they had Commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;tre&s;&s;e all &s;uch Ships, wherein any Spani&s;h Souldiers &s;hould be tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rted into the Low-Countrey, And that all this preparation to the Sea, was ordained again&s;t the Spain&s;h King, and the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI></P>
<P>And moreover, That the Admirall at the &s;ame time, received Commandment from the King, to &s;end E&s;pialls into <HI>Peru,</HI> an Iland of the new found World, mo&s;t plentifull of Gold above all the other, now being in the Spaniards Dominion, to learn if there were any good enterpri&s;e to be attempted, or atchieved for the getting of it. Which matter was committed to a certain Gentleman, one of the Admiralls train, who went thither accompanied with a certain Portingall, a man mo&s;t skilfull of tho&s;e Navigations, whom the Admirall had joyned with him by the Kings Commandment, and is not yet returned.</P>
<P>Now it cannot be expre&s;&s;ed how many, and how great tokens of mo&s;t loving minde t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e King at that time &s;hewed to the Admirall, and to the County <HI>Rochfaucault,</HI> and to <HI>Theligny,</HI> and to the re&s;t of the chief Noblemen of the Religion. Fir&s;t, All &s;uch things as in the former warres had been taken away in the Towns, Ferms, and Ca&s;tles of the Admirall and <HI>d'Andelot,</HI> the King cau&s;ed to be &s;ought out and re&s;tored. If there were any other whom the King under&s;tood to be beloved and e&s;teemed of the Admirall, or to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ve at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ained any &s;peciall honour in the &s;aid late warres, tho&s;e he liberally benefited and rewarded. To the Admirall him&s;elf he commanded one day to be given a hundred thou&s;and pounds of his own trea&s;ure, in recompence of his former lo&s;&s;es. W en his
<PB N="10" REF="6"> Brother the Cardinall <HI>Cba&s;tillion,</HI> endowed with many great and wealthy benefices, was departed his life, the King gave him the fruits of one whole yeer. Al&s;o the King wrote to <HI>Pbilibert</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> That he &s;hould do him a mo&s;t acceptable plea&s;ure, if he did not onely de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l more gently with tho&s;e that in the former warres had ayded tho&s;e of the Religion, but al&s;o would u&s;e clemency and mildene&s;&s;e toward all other that profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame Religion within His Dominions.</P>
<P>And for that there was old enmity between the Gui&s;ians and the Admirall, whereby it was to be doubted, that perillous contentions would ari&s;e in the Realm of <HI>France,</HI> the King willed it to be &s;ignified to them both in His Name, That they &s;hould for His &s;ake, and the Common-weals, give over tho&s;e di&s;plea&s;ures, and He pre&s;cribed them a certain form of Reconciliation and Agreement; the &s;ame whereof, the Foundations had been laid almo&s;t &s;ix yeers before in the Town of <HI>Molins,</HI> where the King calling to him the greate&s;t e&s;tates of His Realm, after con&s;ultation and deliberation had upon the mat|ter, pronounced the Admirall not guilty of the death of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> wherewith he was charged by the young Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> and his Kin&s;men: And &s;o the King by the advi&s;e of His Coun&s;ell had ended that controver&s;ie.</P>
<P>Furthermore, The Cardinall of <HI>Lorain</HI> (who as we have &s;aid, was the very forger of all the former warres) to take away all jealou&s;ie of new practi&s;es, was departed to <HI>Rome,</HI> and took with him his familiar friend the late created Cardinall <HI>Pelvey,</HI> one reputed a mo&s;t &s;ubtill and crafty per&s;on, under pretence of going to the election of a new Pope in place of the old Pope then lately decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But there was none greater, and more a&s;&s;ured token of publike peace and quietne&s;&s;e then this, That the King purpo&s;ed to give His Si&s;ter <HI>Margaret</HI> in marriage to the Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> the Sonne of the Queen of <HI>Navarre;</HI> which Prince had in the la&s;t warre defend|ed the cau&s;e of the Religion, and been Soveraign of their Army. Which marriage the King declared, That it &s;hould be the mo&s;t &s;treight bond of civill Concord, and the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured te&s;timony of His good will to tho&s;e of the Religion.</P>
<P>Yea, and al&s;o becau&s;e it was alleaged, That the &s;aid Prince <HI>Henry</HI> was re&s;trained in con&s;cience, &s;o as he might not marry the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> being of a contrary Religion, a Catholike, and given to the Rites of the Romi&s;h Church, the King for an&s;wer &s;aid, That He would di&s;charge her of the Popes Laws; And notwith&s;tanding, the crying out of all His Courtiers to the contrary, He permitted him, That without all Ceremonies, in the Porch of the great Church of <HI>Paris,</HI> the marriage &s;hould be celebrate in &s;uch a form, as the Mini&s;ters of the reformed Church mi&s;liked not.</P>
<P>Which thing being by report and Letters, &s;pread through the World, It cannot be ex|pre&s;&s;ed how much it made the hearts of tho&s;e of the Religion, a&s;&s;ured, and out of care, and how it ca&s;t out all fear and jealou&s;ies out of their minds, what a confidence it brought them of the Kings good will towards them. Finally, How much it rejoyced forraign Princes and States, that favoured the &s;ame Religion. But the Admirals minde was much more &s;tabli&s;hed by a Letter, which about the &s;ame time <HI>Theligny</HI> brought him with the Kings own Hand and &s;ealed, wherein was contained, That what&s;oever the Admirall &s;hould do for the matter of the intended warre of the Low-Country, the King would allow and ratifie the &s;ame, as done by his own Commandment. About that time <HI>Lodo|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ck</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> with the Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> a Lady mo&s;t zealou&s;ly affected to the
<PB N="11" REF="6"> Religion, came to the French Court. The league was made between King <HI>Charles</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Articles thereof put in writing. The marriage was ap|pointed to be holden in the Town of <HI>Paris.</HI> For which cau&s;e the Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> during tho&s;e few dayes, repaired thither, to provide things for the &s;olemnity of the Wedding. For the &s;ame cau&s;e, the King &s;ent to the Admirall one <HI>Cavaignes,</HI> a man of an excellent &s;harp wit, whom for the Admiralls &s;ake, the King had advanced to great honour, requiring the Admirall to go before to <HI>Paris,</HI> as well for the &s;aid preparation, as al&s;o for the matter of the warre of the Low-Country, promi&s;ing, that he him&s;elf would within few dayes follow after him; A&s;&s;uring him, that there was now no cau&s;e for him to feare the threatnings and mad outrages of the Pari&s;ians. For in a&s;much as the &s;ame towne is above all other given to &s;uper&s;titions and is with &s;editious preachings of Monks and Friers dayly enflamed to cruelty, it is hard to expre&s;&s;e how bitterly they hated the Admirall and the profe&s;&s;ors of that Religion. Whereto was added a grief of their minde conceived certain dayes before, by rea&s;on of a certain &s;tone cro&s;&s;e gilted and built afte the manner of a &s;pire &s;teeple, commonly called Ga&s;tignes cro&s;&s;e, which the Admirall with great earne&s;t &s;ute obtained of the King to be overthrown: for he allea|ged, that being erected in the mid&s;t of the rage of the civill warre, as it were in triumph to the reproach of one of the Religion, it was a monument of civill di&s;&s;ention, and &s;o a matter offen&s;ive to peace and concord.</P>
<P>The King well knowing this deadly hate of the Pari&s;ians to the Admirall, wrote his letters to Marc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the provo&s;t of the marchants (which is the highe&s;t dignity in <HI>Paris</HI>) with &s;harp threatnings if there &s;hould be rai&s;ed any &s;tirre or trouble by rea&s;on of the Admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">als coming. To the &s;ame effect, al&s;o the Duke of <HI>Anjow</HI> the Kings Brother, and the Queen-Mother wrote to the &s;ame Marcell and the re&s;t of the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Paris,</HI> So that now there &s;eemed utterly no occa&s;ion left for the Admirall, to fear or di&s;tru&s;t. And within few dayes after, the King &s;ent <HI>Briquemault</HI> a man of g eat vertue and e&s;ti|mation, to the Admirall, with the &s;ame in&s;tructions, &s;aying, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t the matter of the Low-Countrey could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t well be dealt in without his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Admirall per&s;waded by thus many means, and filled with good h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pe and courage, determined to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> where &s;o &s;oon as he was arrived, and had been honourably and lovingly entertained of the King and His Brethen, and the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">en-Mother, and con&s;ulta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ion entred among them, about the preparation for the Low-Countrey, he de|clared to the King at large, how the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> was in levying of great power, and prepa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing an Army, and that if the King &s;hould di&s;&s;emble his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">urpo&s;e, it would come to pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, that many hereby would &s;hew them&s;elves &s;lower and &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cker to the enterpri&s;e, and that now were offered great means to do good, which if he let &s;lip, he &s;hould not &s;o ea&s;ily recover the like again hereafter. And therefore it was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t to take the advantage of this opportunity.</P>
<P>A few dayes before, <HI>Lodovick</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> went &s;ecretly into the Frontie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Low-Countrey, and took wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h him as Partners of his journey and Privy to His Coun&s;ell, three Frenchmen of great credit with the Admirall, namely <HI>Saucourt, la Nove,</HI> and <HI>Genlis,</HI> to whom the King had given in charge to &s;ee if they could by any means attempt and po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e any Towns bordering upon his Realm. They gathering divers other Gen|tlemen into their company, went &s;peedily into the Low-Countrey, the Admirall not
<PB N="12" REF="7"> knowing of it. Who as &s;oon as he under&s;tood of their going thither, wrote unto them, th t he much marvelled what they meant, &s;aying, that he well knew there could be no power g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tten ready before forty dayes end, and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;hould be well advi&s;ed to do nothing ra&s;hly, nor to overthrow with ha&s;te their devices that &s;eemed not ripe to be executed.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI> inflamed with the &s;ight and de&s;ire of his Countrey, and fear|ing the mutablene&s;&s;e of the King, did fir&s;t at the &s;udden &s;et upon <HI>Valentiennes,</HI> but be|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g repul&s;ed by the Spani&s;h Souldiers that were in Garri&s;on in the Ca&s;tle, he ha&s;tily de|parted to <HI>Montz,</HI> and took the Town, being a place very &s;trong by nature and well furni&s;hed with all things nece&s;&s;ary for the warre. Which thing being by report and me&s;&s;engers &s;pread abroad in the Low Countrey, and carried into <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> both encouraged all them of the Religion with great hope, and al&s;o &s;eemed to have now plainly and openly deciphred and di&s;clo&s;ed the minde of the French King. Moreover, <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nlis</HI> returning to <HI>Paris,</HI> when he had made report to the King of all the matter as it had proceeded, ea&s;ily obtained of him, that by his a&s;&s;ent he might leavy certain Bands of footm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n and hor&s;emen of <HI>France,</HI> and carry them to &s;uccour <HI>Montz.</HI> But by the way when he was entred into the Bounds of the Low-Country, having with him to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ber of four thou&s;and footmen, and about four hundred hor&s;emen, they were be&s;et by the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and the mo&s;t part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tre&s;&s;ed; which thing was well known to have been wrought by the means of the <HI>Gui&s;ians,</HI> which by daily Me&s;&s;ages and Let|ters, adverti&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> of their purpo&s;es and preparation. Which fal&s;ehood of theirs, many mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ffectionate to the Romi&s;h Religion, were highly offended with, becau&s;e a great number addicted to the &s;ame Romi&s;h Religion were in that company.</P>
<P>With this lo&s;&s;e, and with the re&s;cue of the Town of <HI>Valentiennes,</HI> the King &s;eemed to be much troubled for he feared lea&s;t h s Coun&s;ells being di&s;clo&s;ed to the Spani&s;h King, would at length breed &s;ome cau&s;e of quarrell and warre.

<P>When the day came, the Marriage was with Royall pomp &s;olemnized before the great Church of <HI>Paris,</HI> and a certain Form of words &s;o framed, as di&s;agreed with the Religi|on of neither &s;ide, was by the Kings Commandment pronounced by the Cardinall of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rbon,</HI> the King of <HI>Navarr's</HI> Uncle; and &s;o the Matrimony celebrate with great joy of the King, and all good men, the Bride was with great trayn and pomp led into the Church to hear Ma&s;&s;e, and in the mean time the Bride-groom, who mi&s;liked the&s;e Ce|remonies, together with <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Lewes,</HI> and the Admirall, and other noble men of the &s;ame Religion, walked without the Church door, wayting for the Brides return.</P>

<P>After the marriage ended at <HI>Paris,</HI> which was the time that the Admirall had appoin|ted to return to his own hou&s;e, he moved the King concerning his departure. But &s;o great was the preparation of playes, &s;o great was the magnificence of Banquets and &s;hews, and the King &s;o earne&s;tly bent to tho&s;e matters, that he had no ley&s;ure, not onely for waighty affairs, but al&s;o not &s;o much as to take his naturall &s;leep. For in the French Court, Dancings, Maskings, Stage-playes (wherein the King exceedingly de|lighteth) are commonly u&s;ed in the night time: And &s;o the time that is fitte&s;t for Coun|&s;ell and mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of Governance, is by rea&s;on of nightly riotous &s;itting up, of nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ity con&s;umed in &s;leep.

And &s;uch a multitude is there begun to be of Italians, commonly throughout all <HI>France,</HI> &s;pecially in the Court, &s;ince the admini&s;tration of the Realm was committed to the Queen-Mother, that many do commonly call it <HI>France-Italian,</HI> and &s;ome tearm it a Colony, and &s;ome a common Sink of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e madne&s;&s;es of the Court, were the cau&s;e that the Admirall could not have acce&s;&s;e to the Kings &s;peech, nor entrance to deal in waighty matters. But when they that were &s;ent from the reformed Churches, to complain of injuries commonly done to tho&s;e of the Religion, under&s;tood of the Admirals purpo&s;e to depart, they did with all &s;peed deliver to him their Books and Petitions, and be&s;ought him, not to depart from the Court, till he had dealt in the cau&s;e of the Churches, and delivered their Petitions to the King and His Coun&s;ell.

<P>Be&s;ides this delay, there was another matter that &s;tayed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">im. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e was owing to the Rutters of <HI>Germany,</HI> which had &s;erved on the part of the Religion in the la&s;t warre, great &s;ummes of money for their wages, in which matter the Admirall travelled with incredible earne&s;tne&s;&s;e and care.</P>
<P>Concerning all the&s;e affairs, the Admirall (as he determined before) having acce&s;&s;e and opportunity for that purpo&s;e, moved the Kings privy Councell the twenty &s;econd day of <HI>August,</HI> which was the fift day after the King of <HI>Navarr's</HI> marriage, and &s;pent much time in that treaty. About noon, when he was in returning home from the Coun|&s;ell, with a great company of Noblemen and Gentlemen; behold, a Harquebuzier out of a Window of a hou&s;e neer adjoyning, &s;hot the Admirall with two bullets of lead through both the Armes. When the Admirall felt him&s;elf wounded, nothing at all
<PB N="15" REF="8"> amazed, but with the &s;ame countenance that he was accu&s;tomed, he &s;aid, through yonder Window it was done; go &s;ee who are in the hou&s;e. What manner of treachery is this? Then he &s;ent a certain Gentleman of his company to the King to declare it unto him. The King at that time was playing at Tennis with the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as he heard of the Admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">als hurt, he was marvellou&s;ly moved as it &s;eemed, and threw away His Racket that he played with on the ground, and taking with Him His Brother in Law, the King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> He retired into His Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen that were with the Admirall brake into the hou&s;e, from whence he received his hurt, there they found only one woman, the keeper of the hou&s;e, and &s;hortly after al&s;o a Boy, his lacky, that had done the deed, and therewithall they found the Harquebuze lying upon the Table in that Chamber, from whence the noy&s;e was heard: him that &s;hot they found not, for he in great ha&s;t was runne away out at the back Gate, and getting on hor&s;e-back, which he had waiting for him ready &s;adled at the door, he rode a great pace to Saint <HI>Anthonies</HI> Gate, where he had a fre&s;h hor&s;e tarrying for him if need were, and another at <HI>Marcelles</HI> Gate. Then by the Kings Commandment a great number rode out in po&s;t into all parts to pur&s;ue him; but for that he was &s;lipped into by wayes, and received into a certain Ca&s;tle, they could not overtake him.</P>
<P>At the &s;uite of the King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and others; the King by and by gave Commi&s;&s;ion for inquiry to be made of the matter, and committed the examining thereof, to three cho&s;en per&s;ons of the Parliament of <HI>Paris, Thua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and <HI>Mor|&s;ant,</HI> and <HI>Viol</HI> a Coun&s;ellor.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It was found, That the &s;ame hou&s;e belonged to a Prie&s;t, a Canon of Saint <HI>Germain,</HI> who&s;e name is <HI>Villemure,</HI> which had been the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;es</HI> Schoolma&s;ter in his youth, and &s;till continued a retainer toward him. Then the woman which we &s;aid was found in the hou&s;e, being taken and brought before them, confe&s;&s;ed that a few dayes before, there came to her one <HI>Chally,</HI> &s;ometime a Ma&s;ter <HI>d'Ho&s;tel</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;es</HI> hou&s;e, and now of the Kings Court, and commanded her to make much of the man that had done this deed, and to lodge him in the &s;ame Bed and Chamber where <HI>Villemure</HI> was wont to lye, for that he was his friend and very familiar acquaintance, and that <HI>Villemure</HI> would be very glad of it. The name of him that &s;hot, was very diligently kept &s;ecret. Some &s;ay it was <HI>Manrevet,</HI> which in the third civill warre, traiterou&s;ly &s;lew his Captain <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Movy,</HI> a mo&s;t valiant and noble Gentleman, and &s;traightway fled into the enemies Camp. Some &s;ay it was <HI>Bondot,</HI> one of the Archers of the Kings guard. When the womans confe&s;&s;ion was brought to the King, he immediately called <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Nance,</HI> Captain of His guard, and commanded him to apprehend <HI>Challey,</HI> and bring him to Him. <HI>Challey</HI> a&s;&s;oon as he heard the &s;troke of the peace, fled into the Kings Ca&s;tle called the <HI>Lovure,</HI> and hide him in the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;es</HI> Chamber, from whence he conveyed him&s;elf away a&s;&s;oon as he had heard of the Kings Commandment. When <HI>de Nance</HI> was informed of his departure, he an&s;wered that <HI>Challey</HI> was a Gentle|man of good wor&s;hip, and there was no doubt, but when need were, he would appear before the King and the Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were doing, and the Admiralls wound in dre&s;&s;ing, <HI>Theligny</HI> went by his commandment to the King, and mo&s;t humbly be&s;ought him in the name of his Father-in-Law, That His Maje&s;ty would vouch&s;afe to come unto him, for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">is life

The King an&s;wered that he very well liked of that ad|vice, and that he was fully determined to provide as well for the Admiralls &s;afety as for his owne, and that he would pre&s;erve the Admirall as the ball of his eye, and that he had in admiration the con&s;tancy and fortitude of the man, and that he never before that time beleeved that there could be &s;o great valiantne&s;&s;e of courage in any mortall per&s;on.</P>

<P>In the meane time, tho&s;e of the Noble mens bands brake into all the Chambers of the Admirals hou&s;e, and &s;uch as they found either in their beds, or hidden, they mangled them with many wounds, and &s;o &s;laughtered them.

<PB N="43" REF="12"> the Cheualier King Henries ba&s;tard, <HI>Gonzague, Tauaignes,</HI> and the other great Lords, did with reward of the &s;poyle and bootie encourage the multitude to the &s;laughter, and cried out aloud that this was the Kings will. So all the re&s;t of the day from mor|ning to evening, the ra&s;call multitude, encouraged by &s;poyle and robberie, ran with their bloody &s;words raging throughout all the towne: they &s;pared not the aged nor women, nor the very babes, in ioy and triumph they threw the &s;laine bodies out at the windowes; &s;o as there was not in manner any one &s;treete or lane, that &s;eemed not &s;trawed with murthered carca&s;es.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were thus a doing in the towne, the King of Navarre and the prince of Conde, whom the King had lodged in his owne ca&s;tle of the Lowre, were by the Kings Commaundement &s;ent for and conveyed unto him. But their compa|ny, their &s;ervitors of their chamber, their friends reteining to them, their &s;chole|ma&s;ters, and tho&s;e that had the bringing up of them, crying out aloud to the Kings fidelitie for &s;uccoure, were thru&s;t out of the chambers, and by the Kings guard of Switzers hewed in pieces and &s;laughtered in the Kings own &s;ight.

A little afore day, hearing the running of men, and noy&s;e of Armor, and cries and killings, they ro&s;e in ha&s;te, and immediatly <HI>de Nance,</HI> whom we have before &s;po|ken of, came to them, and commaunded them in the Kings name to come downe in|to the Court, and to leave their weapons behind them, and la&s;tly to depart out of the ca&s;tle. When <HI>de Pilles</HI> &s;aw him&s;elfe thru&s;t out among the multitude of the murthering &s;ouldiers, and beheld the bodies of them that were &s;laine, he cried out with a very lowde voice that the King might well heare him prote&s;ting upon the Kings fidelitie, and dete&s;ting his trayterous infidelitie, and therwith he took off a rich cloake which he wore, and gave it to one of his acquaintance, &s;aying, take here this token of <HI>Pilles</HI> and hereafter remember <HI>Pilles</HI> mo&s;t unworthyly and &s;hamfully &s;laine. Oh my good Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Pilles,</HI> &s;aid the other, I am none of them: I thanke you for your cloake, but I will not receive it with that condition, and &s;o refu&s;ed to take the cloake: and immediately <HI>de Pilles</HI> was thru&s;t through by one of the guarde with a parti&s;an, and died. And this end had this mo&s;t valiant and noble gentleman. And then his body was throwen into the quarrey with the re&s;t, which when they that pa&s;&s;ed by did be|hold, the &s;ouldiers cryed out, there they be that made a&s;&s;ault vpon vs, and would have killed the King-<HI>Leranne</HI> being thru&s;t through with a Sword, e&s;caped and ran in|to the Queene of <HI>Navarres</HI> chamber, and was by hir kept and pre&s;erved from the violence of tho&s;e that per&s;ued him.

The profit of all the Robberies came to the hands of the&s;e labourers, and to the Kings trea&s;ury little or nothing.

<P>This butchetly &s;laughter of Paris thus pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">formed, and foure hundred hou&s;es (as is above&s;ayd) &s;acked, immediatly me&s;&s;enges were &s;ent in po&s;t into all parts of the Realme, with oft &s;hifting their hor&s;es for ha&s;t, to command all other Cities in the Kings name to follow the example of <HI>Paris,</HI> and to cau&s;e to be killed as many as they had among them of the reformed Religion.</P>
<P>The&s;e commandements it is wonderfull to tell how readily and cheerefully the greate&s;t part of the Cities of France did obey and execute.

<PB N="45" REF="13"> the true copie of which letter is hereafter in&s;erted, but the &s;ame mo&s;t mighty and by the con&s;ent of all Nations commonly called the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, within two dayes after came into the Parliament accompanied with a great traine of his bre|thren, and other Princes. The councell being a&s;&s;embled, he &s;itting in his throne, began to &s;peake unto them, he declared that he was certified, that the Admirall with cer|taine of his complices had con&s;pired his death, and had intended the like purpo&s;e a|gain&s;t his Brethren, the Queen his Mother, and the King of <HI>Navar,</HI> and that for this cau&s;e he had commanded his friends to &s;lay the &s;aid Admirall and all his confederates, and &s;o to prevent the trea&s;on of his enemies.</P>

<P>After the Kings oration ended, <HI>Chri&s;topher Thuane</HI> Pre&s;ident of that Parliament, a man very notable for his light braine and his cruell heart, did with very large words con|gratulate unto the King, that he had now with guile and &s;ubtiltie overcome the&s;e his enemies, whom he could never vanqui&s;h by Armes and battell, &s;aying therein that the King had mo&s;t fully verified the old &s;aying of <HI>Lewes</HI> the eleventh, his progenitor King of France, which was wont to &s;ay that he knew never a Latine &s;entence but this one, <HI>Qui ne&s;cit di&s;&s;imulare, ne&s;cit regnare,</HI> He that cannot skill to di&s;&s;emble, cannot skill to be a king. But <HI>Pibrace,</HI> the advocate of the Finances, made a &s;hort oration, the &s;um whereof was to this effect, that although the King had iu&s;t and great cau&s;e to bee di&s;|plea&s;ed, yet he thought it more agreeable with his Maie&s;ties clemency and goodne&s;&s;e to make an end of the &s;laughters and common &s;poyle, and not to &s;uffer &s;uch outrages any longer committed without iudiciall proceeding in the cau&s;e: and be&s;ought his Maie&s;ty that from thenceforth it would plea&s;e him to u&s;e the Law, which is well knowne to be the onely &s;tabli&s;hment of Kingdomes and Empires: and that there had bin already given to the commonaltie too perilous an example to follow. An arre&s;t of Parliament with the Kings Royall a&s;&s;ent being made to that effect, there were imme|diately Heralds and Trumpetters &s;ent round about all the Towne, and an edict pro|claimed in the Kings name, that from thenceforth the &s;laughters and common but|cherly murtherings &s;hould cea&s;e, and that all per&s;ons &s;hould ab&s;taine from pillage and robberie.</P>

Some cited the law of the twelve tables, <HI>Si patronus clienti fraudem facit, &s;acer esto.</HI> if the Patrone or Soveraigne defraud his client or Va&s;&s;all, be he out of protection, They di&s;puted al&s;o that like faith as the va&s;&s;all oweth to his Lord, the Lord oweth al&s;o to his va&s;&s;all, and for what cau&s;es, and for what felonies the va&s;&s;all lo&s;eth his tenancies, for the &s;ame cau&s;es and felonies the Lord lo&s;eth his Seigniorie. Some &s;aid that the right hand in ancient time was called the pledge of the Faith of a King, and that if a King &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e, there is no communion of right with him, and he is no more to be accounted a King, neither of his owne &s;ubjects, nor of &s;trangers. Kingly Vertues in times pa&s;t have bin reported to be the&s;e, ju&s;tice, gentlene&s;&s;e, and clemencie: but cruelty and out|rage have ever bin di&s;prai&s;ed both in all per&s;ons, and &s;pecially in Princes. <HI>Scipio</HI> hath in all ages bin prai&s;ed, who was wont to &s;ay, that he had rather &s;ave one Citizen, then kill a thou&s;and enemies, which &s;entence, <HI>Antonius</HI> the Emperour, &s;urnamed <HI>Pius</HI> the kind or vertuous did often repeat. It was a mo&s;t &s;hamefull by-word of young <HI>Tibe|rius,</HI> to be called Clay, tempered with blood. They &s;ay al&s;o, as Kings have power of life or death over their &s;ubject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, but not without hearing the cau&s;e, and the iudiciall proceeding: that there can be alledged no greater authority, then the Dictators had at Rome, in whom was the Soveraigne power of peace and war, of life and death, and without appeale, yet was it not lawfull for them to execute a citizen, his cau&s;e un|heard. Onely theeves and Murtherers take away mens lives without order of Law, &amp; hearing their cau&s;e. Who can doubt (&s;aid they) but that this &s;o great outrage, &s;o great &s;hedding of Chri&s;tian blood is the fruit of the cur&s;ed life of the Courtiers? For (&s;aid they) now throughout all France, whoredome and loo&s;e leudne&s;&s;e of life are &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="15"> free and u&s;uall, that now the mo&s;t part of the women of <HI>France</HI> &s;eeme to be in manner common: and the wicked bla&s;phemies and continuall execrations and di&s;honorings of Gods mo&s;t holy name and Maje&s;tie, are &s;uch as God cannot longer beare: and true it is, though incredible among forreine Nations, that the Catholikes of France have pre&s;cribed them&s;elves this for a &s;peciall marke to be knowne from other men, that at every third word they bla&s;phemou&s;ly &s;weare by the head, death, blood, &amp; bellie of GOD: and wonderfull it is, that the King him&s;elfe is &s;o much delighted in this cu&s;tome of &s;wearing and bla&s;pheming: and this as it were a pe&s;tilent infecti|on is &s;pred abroade and common among the very Plough-men and Pea&s;ants, &s;o as none among them now &s;peaketh three words without mo&s;t filthy bla&s;pheming and horrible execration of God.

<P>Now as touching the Admirals &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;piracie, who can thinke it likely that he &s;hould enterpri&s;e any &s;uch thing within the walls of <HI>Paris?</HI> For in the Court there is continually watching and warding a garri&s;on of the Kings: and at the entry of his Ca&s;tle the guards of <HI>Ga&s;coines, Scots</HI> and <HI>Switzers,</HI> are continually attending; and the King him&s;elf both alwaies before, and &s;pecially at that time, by rea&s;on of his &s;ters marriage, had a great trayne of Princes, great Lords, Noblemen and Gentle|men about him. Moreover it was well knowne, that in <HI>Paris</HI> within three houres &s;pace might be a&s;&s;embled and put in Armour, three&s;core thou&s;and cho&s;en armed men, &s;pecially again&s;t the Admirall, whom no man is ignorant that the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> mo&s;t dead|ly hated: be&s;ide that, the Noble young men that came thither with the King of <HI>Na|varre</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> by rea&s;on of the marriage, &amp; brought with them their wives, their &s;i&s;ters and their kin&s;women, thought at that time upon nothing but up|on triumph, and exerci&s;es of pa&s;time, and gay furniture of apparell and ornaments. Finally, at whither of the&s;e two times can it be likely that the Admirall attempted this con&s;piracie? was it before he was hurt? why? at that time he found the King his mo&s;t loving, or at lea&s;t his mo&s;t liberall and bountifull good Lord: neither could be hope ever to have a more favourable Soveraigne in <HI>France.</HI> Was it then after hee was hurt? as though for&s;ooth he lying &s;ore of two &s;o great woundes, aged, maimed of both his armes, the one wherof the Phi&s;itians con&s;ulted whether it were to be cut off, accompanied with three hundred young men, would &s;et upon three&s;core thou&s;and armed men, or in &s;o &s;mall a time could lay the plot for &s;o great, and &s;o heynous a fact: for he lived &s;carce fortie houres after his hurt, in which time he was enjoyned by the Phy&s;itians to forbeare talke. Againe, if he had bin detected of any &s;uch crime, was he not committed to <HI>Co&s;&s;in</HI> and to his keeping, and &s;o environed, all the wries be&s;et about him, and &s;o in the Kings power that if it had plea&s;ed the King he might at all times in a moment be caried to pri&s;on? why was not orderly inqui|ry and judiciall proceeding u&s;ed according to the cu&s;tome and lawes and generall right of Nations, and witne&s;&s;es produced according to the forme of Law? but be it, that the Admirall and a few other of his confederats and followers had con&s;pired? why yet proceeded the outragious cruelty upon the re&s;t that were innocent, why upon ancient Matrons? why upon noble Ladies and young Gentlewomen and Vir|gins

<P>Now to returne to <HI>Paris,</HI> the Admiralls body being hanged up by the heeles upon the common Gallowes of <HI>Paris,</HI> as is afore&s;aid, the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> went thither by heapes to &s;ee it; and the Queene Mother to feede her eyes with that &s;pectacle, had a minde al&s;o to go thither, and &s;he caried with her the King and both her other Sonnes, but the next night following, the body was conveyed away, and (as it is thought) bu|ried about that time, whereas many of the Court &s;ecretly muttered that the King &s;hould by this fact incurre di&s;honour, not only among forreine Nations, but al&s;o with all po&s;teritie in time to come for ever, <HI>Morvillier,</HI> of whom we have made mention before, one that is accompted the principall lewd practi&s;er and wicked &s;ycophant of all <HI>France,</HI> and the fir&s;t author and chiefe meanes of bringing the Je&s;u|ites into <HI>France,</HI> came to the Queene Mother and told her, that it was be&s;t that &s;ome of tho&s;e that were lately taken flying and hiding them&s;elves, &s;hould for ma|ners &s;ake be brought to open judgement, and after the accu&s;tomed manner &s;hould be enquired upon, that they might be condemned by the &s;entence of certaine Judges picked out for that purpo&s;e, and &s;o openly executed in &s;ight of the people. There were called to coun&s;ell hereupon <HI>Birage, Limege, Thuan,</HI> and <HI>Belleure.</HI> They not only allowed <HI>Morvilliers</HI> opinion, but al&s;o gave advice, that a man of hey made in figure for the Admirall (for his body, as we have &s;aid, could not be found) &s;hould be drag|ged by the Boureau through the &s;treets, his armes and En&s;ignes of honour broken, his memory condemned, his Ca&s;tles and farmes ra&s;ed, his children pronounced in|famous, unnoble, and inte&s;table, and all the trees in his woods to be hewen downe to the height of &s;ixe foote. There was among tho&s;e that were apprehended, one <HI>Cavaignes,</HI> ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts to the King, and <HI>Briquemault,</HI> of whom we have be|fore &s;poken; This <HI>Briquemault</HI> had &s;pent his time in Service in the old wars, in the time of King <HI>Francis</HI> and King <HI>Henry,</HI> and was for the war accompted a man of great experience among the be&s;t now living, and was neere about three&s;core and ten yeares olde. As &s;oone as they were carried into pri&s;on, there were pre&s;ented unto them all the tormenter and the hangman, and they were threatned with torture and tearing their bodies in pieces, unle&s;&s;e they would pre&s;ently &s;ub&s;cribe with their own hands, that they were of councell with the Admirall to kill the King and his brethren, and the Queene Mother, and the King of <HI>Navarre.</HI> They all cried out that they were ready to &s;uffer death mo&s;t willingly, fora&s;much as the Kings plea&s;ure was it &s;hould be &s;o: but &s;o great torture they could not beare, and therefore humbly be&s;ought his royall goodne&s;&s;e and clemencie to pardon them that torment, and yet tru&s;ting upon the mercy of God, they hoped that they &s;hould &s;uffer exceeding great paines, rather then &s;taine them&s;elves with &s;o great &s;hame, or confe&s;&s;e an untrue crime again&s;t them&s;elves. They that were fir&s;t a&s;&s;igned their judges, hearing their cries and defences, and fearing the judgement of the world, &s;aid plainly that they would not draw upon them&s;elves mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured infamie for condemning them. Ther|fore there were new Judges appointed in their places: to them was adjoyned &s;uch
<PB N="26" REF="17"> a tormenter and notarie, as were thought fitte&s;t for the purpo&s;e. And &s;o <HI>Briquemault</HI> and <HI>Cavaignes</HI> were quickly condemned by a &s;hadowed forme of Law, and led to the gibbet &s;tanding in the principall &s;treete of the Towne, and in the &s;ight of many thou|&s;ands of men gazing at them, To this &s;pectacle the Queene-mother led the King and her other Sonnes, and her Sonne in law the King of <HI>Navarre.</HI></P>
<P>It was thought commodious for playing of this la&s;t act, that Briquemault &s;hould in hearing of all the People aske pardon of the King, and for that purpo&s;e there were &s;ome &s;uborned to put him in minde, that if hee would hee might ea&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y purcha&s;e his life, for the King was of nature full of clemencie and mercy, and if hee would aske pardon of his maje&s;tie with confe&s;&s;ing his offence, hee &s;hould ea&s;ily obtaine it. Hee an&s;wered with a valiant and bold courage, that it was not his part but the Kings to aske pardon of God for this fault: and that hee would never crave forgivene&s;&s;e of that offence whereof hee well knew him&s;elfe and had God to witne&s;&s;e that hee was cleare and innocent. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">verthele&s;&s;e, hee be&s;ought God to forgive the King this fault. So were thefe two excellent and famous men with halters fa&s;tened about their necks thrown by the hangman from the ladder and hanged, and therewithall al&s;o the man of &s;traw made for figure of the Admirall, was tyed fa&s;t and hanged with them, after a prepo&s;terous order of Law, whereby the Admirall was fir&s;t &s;laine and then con|demned.</P>
<P>But whereas in a manner in all Townes there were great &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ughters committed, yet was there none more horrible nor more outragious then the Butcherly murder at Li|ons. So &s;oone as the Letters from the Court were brought to <HI>Mandelot</HI> governor of the Towne; fir&s;t, by a cryer and trumpet he cau&s;ed to be proclaymed, that all the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Religion &s;hould appeare pre&s;ently before him at his hou&s;e. They with|out all delay repaired to him: As &s;oone as they were come, he commanded them all to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led to pri&s;on by &s;uch officers as &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned them. They obeyed his word and followed the officers that led them. By rea&s;on of the great multitude, they &s;orted them into &s;undry pri&s;ons; then <HI>Mandelot</HI> willed the common Executioner to be commanded in his name to take &s;ome to helpe him, and to kill tho&s;e that were in pri&s;on. The executioner an&s;wered, that he u&s;ed not to execute the Law upon any but &s;uch as were condemned, and in publike and open places, and therefore willed him to &s;eeke another &s;laughterman if he would. <HI>Mandelot</HI> thus refu&s;ed by the Executioner, commanded the garri&s;on Souldiers of the Ca&s;tle to do it, the Souldiers an&s;wered, that it was again&s;t their honour, to u&s;e weapons upon men bound and lying &s;uppliant before them; if they had rai&s;ed any rebellion, or had offended or provoked them, they &s;aid they would mo&s;t readily have fought with them; being thus refu&s;ed by them al&s;o, at the la&s;t he committed the matter to the watermen and Butchers, tho&s;e fellowes being let into the pri&s;ons, went to it with chopping knives and Butchers ax|es. Such as they found pro&s;trate at their feete, pittiou&s;ly holding up their hands to hea|ven, crying upon the mercie of God and men, they did for &s;port cut off their fingers and the tops of their hands, and throughout the whole towne was heard &s;uch a cry and lamentable howling of women and children, that innumerable people, even &s;uch as were zealou&s;ly given even to the Popi&s;h Religion, did dete&s;t that cruelty, and judged that not men but outragious &s;avage bea&s;ts in &s;hape of men were entred into the pri&s;ons. It is well knowne, that a great number of hone&s;t women in the town great with childe,
<PB N="27" REF="17"> were &s;o flighted with the horror of it, that they were delivered before their time; and out of the Court of the goale called the Arch-Bi&s;hops pri&s;on, the blood was &s;eene in the broad day light, to the great abhorring and feare of many that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">held it, run warme and &s;moaking into the next &s;treets of the towne, and &s;o down into the River of <HI>Sene.</HI> There was in that &s;ame Arch-Bi&s;hops pri&s;on an aged man called <HI>Francis Collut,</HI> a Mar|chant of caps, and two young men his Sonnes, whom he had ever cau&s;ed dilligently to be taught and in&s;tructed in Religion, when he &s;aw the Butchers come toward him with their axes, he began to exhort his Children not to refu&s;e the death offred by God. For (&s;aid he) it is the perpetuall de&s;tinie of Religion, and that often &s;uch &s;acrifices doe betide in Chri&s;tian Churches, and Chri&s;tians in all ages have ever beene, and for ever to the worlds end &s;o &s;hall be, as Sheepe among Wolves, Doves among Hawkes, and &s;acrifices among Prie&s;ts. Then the old Father embraced his two young Sonnes, and ly|ing flat on the ground with them, crying aloude upon the mercy of God, was with many woundes both he and his Sonnes &s;laughtered by tho&s;e Butchers: and long time afterward their three bodies had, knit t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gether, yeelded a pittious &s;pectacle to many that beheld them.

And from that time they cea&s;ed not to kill, to robbe, and to &s;poyle. The next day after, which was the fir&s;t day of <HI>September,</HI> the greate&s;t part of the dead bodies were throwen into the River of <HI>Sene,</HI> and the re&s;t of them <HI>Mandelot,</HI> to feede and glut his eyes and heart with blood, cau&s;ed to be carried by Boate to the other &s;ide of the water, and there to be throwen downe upon the greene gra&s;&s;e neere unto the Abbey called <HI>E&s;ue.</HI></P>
<P>There the people of Lions, &s;pecially the <HI>Italians,</HI> of whom by rea&s;on of the Mart there is geat &s;tore in the Towne, &s;atisfied their eyes a while, and did &s;uch &s;pites as they could to the&s;e heaps of carca&s;es, and &s;o exerci&s;ed their cruelty not upon the li|ving onely, but al&s;o upon the dead. And there hapned one thing which for the abho|minable cruelty is not to be omitted. There came to that &s;pectacle certaine Apotheca|ries, and among tho&s;e bodies they perceived &s;ome very fat ones, by and by they went to the Butchers, and told them that they did u&s;e to make certaine &s;peciall medicines of mans greace, and that they might make &s;ome profit thereof. Which as &s;oone as the Butchers under&s;tood, they ran to the heaps and cho&s;e out the fatte&s;t, and laun|ced them with their knives, and pulled out the fat, and &s;old it for money to the Apothecaries.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were doing at Lions, the King being enformed that diver&s;e of the Religion had left their wives and children, and were fled out of the other townes, and lurked &s;ome in the woods, and &s;ome among their friends &s;uch as tooke pitty on them, he practi&s;ed with faire words to allure and call them home againe. He &s;ent to every part me&s;&s;engers and letters, affirming that he was highly di&s;pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ed with tho&s;e &s;laughters and horrible butcheries, and that he would that &s;uch cruelty &s;h uld be &s;everely puni&s;hed: and if the Admirall with a few of his confederates had entred in|to any &s;ecret practi&s;e, it was no rea&s;on, that &s;o many innocents &s;hould beare the pu|ni&s;hment due to a few. Many &s;weetly beguiled with the&s;e words of the King and with the letters of the Governours, retired home againe to their dwellings and hou|&s;es,

About this time the King cau&s;ed to be proclaimed, that &s;uch as had any office or place of charge, unle&s;&s;e they would &s;peedily returne to the Catholique, Apo&s;tolique and Romi&s;h Church, &s;hould give over tho&s;e their tem|porall roomes.

<P>And while the&s;e things were &s;till in doing, yet the King in the meane while &s;ent a|broad his letters and me&s;&s;ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s into all parts, and cau&s;ed to be proclaimed with Trum|pet, that his plea&s;ure was that the Edicts of pacification &s;hould be ob&s;erved: and although they could not have freedome to u&s;e and exerci&s;e their Religion in open places, yet they &s;hould have liberty permitted them to retaine and profe&s;&s;e it with|in their owne hou&s;es, and that no man &s;hould meddle with or di&s;turbe the goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e of the Religion.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame King which but few dayes before, had by letters directed to all the Governours of his Provinces &s;ignified that his cou&s;in the Admirall was &s;laine by the Duke of Gui&s;e to his great &s;orrow, and that him&s;elfe was in great danger, the &s;ame King I &s;ay, now cau&s;ed it with &s;ound of Trumpet to be proclaimed that the trayte|rous and wicked Admirall was &s;laine by his Will and Commandement. He that in few dayes before had by new authority confirmed the libertie of Religion permitted by his Edicts of pacification, the &s;ame King did now not onely take from the profe&s;|&s;ors thereof their offices and honours, but al&s;o pre&s;cribed them in preci&s;e forme of words a forme of abjuring and dete&s;ting their Religion.

<P>NOble Seigniours, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Fontaine,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador for the King your a&s;&s;ured and perfect friend and confederate, and I his Trea&s;urer in this Country, having commande|ment of his Maje&s;ty to communicate with you, as with them whom he accounteth his chief and &s;ure friends, of a chance which lately happened in the City of Paris, his own per&s;on and Court then being there, whereof he received &s;o much more griefe and di&s;plea&s;ure, becau&s;e it fell on &s;uch a time as he feared lea&s;t, or looked for &s;uch a thing. The matter is this. On the 27. day of Augu&s;t la&s;t the Admirall as he went from Louure, was with an harquebuze &s;hot hurt in the hand and arme, whereof when his Maje&s;ty was adverti&s;ed, he commanded incontinent that &s;earch and pu|ni&s;hment were had of the oftend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and the authors of &s;uch a mi&s;chiefe: whereunto when he had readily laid his hand by his Officers, and committed the inhabitants of the hou&s;e, where the harquebuze was &s;hot, to pri&s;on they which were the cau&s;e fir&s;t of the mi&s;chiefe (as it may ea&s;ily be pre&s;uppo&s;ed) becau&s;e they would prevent the inqui&s;ition thereof, heaping one tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion upon another, on the 23. and 24. of the &s;aid moneth a&s;&s;embled a great troupe of people in the night, and moved the people of Paris to a very great &s;edition, who in a rage &s;et upon the Admi|rals lodging, and enforcing the Guard which his Maje&s;ty had &s;et for the Admirals &s;urety and keeping, &s;lew him with certaine other gentlemen in his company, as the like al&s;o was committed upon others in the City, the matter growing in the very &s;ame in&s;tant to &s;uch an outrage and commotion, that whereas his Maje&s;ty had thought to provide remedy for appea&s;ing thereof, he had much a doe with all his Guards to keep his hou&s;e at Louure, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e he lodged with the two Queenes, his mother and the Spou&s;e the Lords his brethren, the King of Navar and ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">er Prin|ces.

<P>WE the Gent. Capt. Burge&s;&s;es and other now being in the Town of Rochel, do give an|&s;wer to you Mon&s;ieur N. and to &s;uch commandements as you give us in the name of his Maje&s;ty, that we cannot acknowledg that that which is &s;ignified unto us, &amp; the proclama|tion which you require that we &s;hould cau&s;e to be publi&s;hed, do proceed from his Maje&s;ty. And thereof we call to witne&s;&s;e his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, his letters of the 22. &amp; 24. of Augu&s;t his owne &s;ignet, and the publi&s;hing of the &s;ame letters, by the which his &s;ayd Maje&s;ty layeth all the fault of all the trouble lately happened, and of the cruell &s;laughter done at Paris, upon tho&s;e of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, protecting that he has enough to do to keep him&s;elfe &s;afe within his Ca&s;tle of Louure with tho&s;e of his guard. And wee &s;hall never &s;uffer our &s;elves to be per&s;waded that &s;o &s;oul an enterpri&s;e and &s;o barbarons a &s;laughter hath at any time entred into the mind of his Ma|je&s;ty, much le&s;&s;e that the &s;ame hath bin done by his expre&s;&s;e commandement, as the paper im|porteth which you have exhibited unto us, nor that his Maje&s;ty hath bin &s;oill advi&s;ed, as him&s;elf to cut off his own arms, or to defile the &s;acred wedding of madam his own &s;i&s;ter with the &s;hed|ding of &s;o much noble &amp; innocent blood &amp; with the &s;hame of &s;o cruell a fact to de&s;tein the na|tion of France &amp; the blood royall which hath heretofore ever among all nations born the name of frank and courteous; nor that he hath had minde to deliver matter to any writers to &s;et forth a tragicall hi&s;tory &s;uch as antiquitie hath never heard &s;peak of the like &amp; &s;uch as po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">teritie cannot report without horror. But that it was fir&s;t laid at Rome, and afterward hatched at Paris, by the authors of all troubles of Fraunct. And how&s;oever it be, we are ready to maint ine that out of the mouth of his Maje&s;ty doth not proceed hot and cold, white and black, and that hee doth not now &s;ay one thing and by and by another, as he &s;hould if the paper that you pre&s;ent unto us had pa&s;&s;ed from him, prote&s;ting that he will inviolably keep his edict, and immediately brea|king the &s;ame in declaring that he commanded tho&s;e murders to be committed, hauing al&s;o m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">de prote&s;tation before that it is to his great grief, and done by the outrage and violence of the&s;e of Gui&s;e again&s;t whom he was not able to make &s;peedy re&s;i&s;tance in time as his Maje&s;ty de&s;ired. And in this quarrell we the Gent. Captains, and other that maketh you this an&s;wer are ready to try it by combat man to man, or otherwi&s;e, to maintaine the honour of our King againg all
<PB N="46" REF="27"> tho&s;e that &s;o prophane holy things, and as much as in them lyeth doe by &s;uch words &amp; titles vi|lainou&s;ly defile the excel encie of his Maje&s;ty and of the noble Princes of his bloud. Which we may right well conjecture and e&s;timate, by the &s;laughters that are yet in doing as well in the Town of Paris as el&s;e where, upon &s;o many noblemen, gentlemen and other, men, women and children, and upon a great number of yong Schollars (the maintenance under God, of Realms &amp; common-weales in time to come) and to many other barbarous, unnaturall and unmanly acts ge+nerally committed. We think therefore and judge that herein trea&s;on is enterpri&s;ed again&s;t the per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty and of my Lords his brethren, and that the Gui&s;ians mean to invade the Crown of the Realm as they have of long time practi&s;ed, &amp; how &s;o ever it be, we &s;ay that his Maje&s;ty is forced by the power that they have taken upon them and u&s;urped by meane of the rebellious &s;tir of the commons of Paris. As for rhat which they &s;ay that the Admirall and tho&s;e of the Religion had con&s;pired again&s;t the K. Maje&s;ty and his brethren, the&s;e be allegations of as great truth and of as good likelyhood, as their manner of proceeding in ju&s;tice hath bin orderly, beginning at execution before examination of the fact. But it is now no need to tarry for time to di&s;cover it for the matter is plain to be &s;eene with eye and groped with hand and all tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h Religion that have remaining any drop of nature of man, doe confe&s;&s;e it and hold down their heads for &s;hame cur&s;ing both with heart and mouth the cruell executors of this abhomina|ble enterpri&s;e and the wicked di&s;turbers of common quiet, which can yet no more &s;uffer, than they hetherto have done that this poore Realm &s;hould long enjoy the benefit of that peace, which the King alone next under God, had wi&s;ely cau&s;ed to be made and to bee accordingly ob&s;erved, whereof this realm began to feele the good ta&s;te, to the great contentment of all per&s;ons, except the enemies of peace and of this realm, namely the Gui&s;ians. Finally, when his Maje&s;ty being out of their hands and power &s;hall declare what is his plea&s;ure, we will endeavour to obey him in all things, wherein our con&s;ciences, which are dedicate to God alone, &s;hall not be wounded, in which ca&s;e we will rather for&s;ake the earth than Heaven, and our fraile and tran&s;itory hou&s;es rather than the heavenly Man&s;ions. <HI>But hitherto the law of Nature, and the duty that we owe to our naturall Prince, to the pre&s;ervation of his Crown, and to the &s;afety of our lives, our w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> and children doth command us to &s;tand upon our Guard and not to put it in the mercy of tho&s;e that have received the &s;ame bloudy Commi&s;&s;ion from the Gui&s;ians under the pretended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ame of the King, to u&s;e us in the &s;ame manner as they have wickedly, traiterou&s;ly &amp; unnaturally done to tho&s;e about his Maje&s;ty, and as it were under his wings, and under the skirts of his robe, which the traitours &s;tranger have &s;tained with the true French bloud, without that his Maje&s;ty had bin able to remedy it, nor to &s;tay their cur&s;ed attempts: &s;o much le&s;&s;e is he able now &s;o far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e off to defend us as he would, which his Maje&s;ties good will being knowne unto us, doth arme us for our defence, and for the &s;afegard of our lives, and of the priviledges which he hath given us, untill &s;uch time as he &s;hall be able by him&s;elfe to defend us again&s;t his enemies and ours.</HI></P>
