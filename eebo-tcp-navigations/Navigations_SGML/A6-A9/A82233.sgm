<P>_OUr late experience of the wofull effects of War, rai&s;eth in us many mo&s;t &s;ad con&s;iderations, and feares of the un|happie continuance thereof, in this our deare Mother Kingdom; unto the prevention of who&s;e Calamities, wee are a&s;&s;ured that God, and Nature, by all Obligations humane, and divine, mo&s;t &s;trictly bind us; In di&s;charge therefore of this our duty unto God, and our Country, we doe in the pre&s;ence of God publi&s;h un|to the world, that we have already u&s;ed, and &s;hall forever hereafter u&s;e, the utmo&s;t of our endeavours, for the hap|pie &s;ettlement, and quiet of this di&s;tracted and bleeding Kingdome: In evidence whereof, we have heretofore humbly petitioned both Hou&s;es of Parliament, for a
<PB N="2" REF="3">&s;peedie Per&s;onall Treaty, betwixt his Maje&s;tie, and the two Hou&s;es, (being the only, and &s;o often by them &s;elves acknowledged expedient, to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;afe, and well grounded peace) yet have been an&s;wered with &s;uch me|ditated protractions and delayes, as gave us ju&s;t cau&s;e to iudge, that all our Endeavours in this kind, would prove fruitle&s;&s;e, and that the over-ruling partie in both (Hou&s;es never meant any &s;uch thing: So that throughly ob&s;erving all our pious endeavours, (with tho&s;e of others unto this purpo&s;e) herein fru&s;trate, we could not bethink our &s;elves of a more &s;peedie and effectuall cour&s;e, to arrive at that ble&s;&s;ed, and by us mo&s;t de&s;ired end; [the peace and pro&s;perity of our Country] then by the rendition of our &s;elves &amp; our returning unto our due Loyalty &amp; Obedience, unto his &s;acred Maie&s;ty, our dear Soveraign; (from whom we cannot without much &s;orrow but acknowledge; that the &s;ubtile malice, &amp; many hypocritical pretentions, of his Maie&s;ties mo&s;t confirmed adver&s;aries did to long alien us.) And in Order unto that to re&s;tore unto his Maie&s;tie, as his mo&s;t undoubted right) &s;uch Ve&s;&s;ells of his Maie|&s;ties Navie Royall, as were in our power, together with what Ships of defence we had of our own, being by this cour&s;e hopefull to render his Maie&s;tie, (now &s;uffering un|der unparalel'd Oppre&s;&s;ions) and his affaires more con&s;i|derable, unto &s;uch as oppo&s;ed him, and hereby the better to di&s;po&s;e &s;uch, unto more vi&s;ible tearmes of Accommo|dation; that his Maje&s;tie might be re&s;tored unto his un|que&s;tionable rights, and royall Prerogatives.</P>
<P>And this; we profe&s;&s;e (before God) unto the whole world, that we could not but know and acknowleghe our
<PB N="3" REF="3">bounden duty, without a fearefull incurring within our own Con&s;ciences, the &s;ecret &s;entence of damnation; ha|ving by our Oaths, and &s;o many &s;acred Obligations, &s;ol|lemnly &s;worn and prote&s;ted, the pre&s;ervation of Religi|on e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, his Maje&s;ties honour, per&s;on, and dignity, and the Liberty of the Subject. All which wee are accordingly re&s;olved, God a&s;&s;i&s;ting, unto our utmo&s;t endeavours to pre&s;erve, though with the apparent hazard of our lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>And we doe hereby invite all Good Subiects, E&s;peci|ally our brethren the Sea Commanders, Marriners, and Seamen, unto a &s;erious con&s;ideration of their &s;everall and re&s;pective duties, unto the&s;e mentioned, great Intere&s;ts, and conjure them with us vigorou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute &s;o ho|ne&s;t and honourable ends, unto which both God, Nature, and their &s;o oft iterated Oaths, (then which nothing can more awe a good Chri&s;tian) mo&s;t firmly bind them and from which, without manife&s;t &s;inning again&s;t their owne Con&s;ciences, and the apparent lo&s;&s;e even of their &s;oules (which God forbid) they can no wayes recede; E&s;peci|cially when their Adherence unto &s;o good and ju&s;t ends, may probably put a full period unto the pre&s;ent mi&s;eries of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Kingdome, or notably contribute unto &s;o good a work; to provoke and annimate them unto the undertaking whereof with us, let them look upon the mo&s;t deploreable condition of the pre&s;ent affaires in this Kingdome, let them behold the Prote&s;tant Religion, (in the religious exerci&s;e whereof God &s;o mightily ble&s;&s;ed our Kingdom, in the reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 6. in the happie dayes of never to be forgotten Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and in the good dayes of K. <HI>Iames</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed memory) ca&s;t out of
<PB N="4" REF="4">doores, and almo&s;t quite overgrown with Schi&s;mes and Here&s;ies.</P>
<P>Behold his &s;acred Maie&s;tie, mo&s;t di&s;loyallie, and trea|cherou&s;ly ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and &s;tricte&s;t durance; debarred the free exerci&s;e of his Religion, deprived of the &s;ociety of his beloved Queen, the comfort of his deare children, the attendance of his faithfull &s;ervants: Behold our Liber|ties trampled upon, and trodden underfoot, by the Ar|bitrary power of a party, &s;upported by force, and an Ar|mie of Sectaries, who have rai&s;ed Exci&s;es, Taxations, free Quarter, and other un&s;upportable burthens upon us.</P>
<P>Look upon the univer&s;al decay of forraign trade, wherby this I&s;land &s;o much flouri&s;hed, and became rich and po|tent above all I&s;les, and a wonder and an Amazement un|to the whole world: what Country &s;o ever we came to trade withall, we found this to be true: And now wee be&s;eech you Brethren, to look upon the &s;ad and ill favou|red countenance of things among&s;t our &s;elves, and how many families in our profe&s;&s;ion, are almo&s;t, or altogether impoveri&s;hed, by the decay of forraign Traffique, and Trade, which is in a pre&s;ent po&s;&s;ibility to be quite lo&s;t unto us and our whole Nation, and to be &s;eized upon by Strangers. And that through the continuance of this mo&s;t unnaturall war, which kept up, will bring utter ruin, and de&s;olation unto this late flouri&s;hing Kingdom.</P>
<P>Two Armies are already entred into the Bowells of the Kingdom, and two more neare the entring, whence Trade both by Sea and Land will be &s;o ob&s;tructed, that
<PB N="5" REF="4">it will be impo&s;&s;ible to trade with any &s;ecurity, which as it will be unto the exceeding Impoveri&s;hment of the people of this Kingdome, &s;o e&s;pecially unto tho&s;e of our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider, that the per&s;ons from whom all the&s;e Evills come upon us, are &s;ome few in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;ome of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and their <HI>Creatures, Exci&s;e-men, Farmers, Purcha&s;ers,</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> Lands, and the <HI>Committees</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and of the <HI>Coun|tyes:</HI> Such as have cheated this Kingdome of many mil|lions, and now fearing they &s;hould be called unto an ac|count, will not be brought to heare of a per&s;onal Trea|ty, or any cour&s;e which may bring peace unto this mi&s;e|rable Nation; Lea&s;t their horrid Impo&s;ture, and Coz|nage, wherewith they have abu&s;ed the three King|domes, &s;hould be reckoned for; to decline which by the Pur&s;e of the Commonwealth, (which they com|mand) they maintain an Army of de&s;perate Sectaries, to uphold them&s;elves, and oppre&s;&s;e our Religion, King, and Kingdome.</P>
<P>There is no way, or meanes under Heaven, left you or us, to re&s;tore peace unto this afflicted Kingdom, to re&s;tore our Religion unto its auncient lu&s;ture and beauty his Ma|je&s;ty unto his Rights, and our &s;elves unto our libertyes, then by adhereing unto his highne&s;&s;e the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who is willing to venture his deare&s;t blood to pre&s;erve ours; nay there is no other way left unto you to &s;ave your Soules; For if you will not keep inviolable your ju&s;t Oathes, you run the Hazard of certaine damnation, The
<PB N="6" REF="5">Con&s;ideration whereof is fearfull, and calls upon you for a pre&s;ent re&s;olution: Which if &s;uch as becomes you, you will forthwith repair unto the Navy, and Fleet with his highnes Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> &amp; in the be&s;t manner you may, tender your loyall Services unto him, for the good Ends mentioned, which if you &s;hall do, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elves, you &s;hall not only performe an Act exceedingly acceptable unto his Maje&s;ty, and his Highne&s;&s;e, worthy of your &s;elves and mo&s;t de&s;ired by us; but al&s;o plea&s;ing unto God, as being your bounden duty, what he requires at your hands, and the neglect whereof he will grievou&s;ly puni&s;h.</P>
<P>This duty of your loyallty we expect from you, and if you &s;hall any wayes decline it, know a&s;&s;uredly, that as we are able, &s;o we are re&s;olved to debar you of all benefit of forraign trade, and to deale with you as profe&s;&s;ed Ene|mies unto your King, and Country, the very thought whereof ought to be mo&s;t odious unto every hone&s;t man, and contrary unto whom we doubt not, you will always &s;hew your &s;elves.</P>
