<HEAD>The General of Great BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>_THE State of every Kingdome well managed by prudent government, seems to me
to represent a humane Body, guided by the soveraignty of the <HI>Reasonable Soul:</HI>
the Countrey and Land it self representing the one, the Actions and State-Affairs
the other. Sith therefore the excellencies of the whole are but imperfectly laid
open, where either of these Parts is defective, our intendment is to take a view as
well out of the outward Body and Lineaments of the now flourishing British Monar|chy
(the Islands) Kingdomes and Provinces thereof in actual possession, (for with
others, no less justly claimed in the continent, we meddle not) which shall be the
continent of our first or <HI>Chorographical Tome,</HI> containing the four first Books of this our <HI>Theatre:</HI> as also
of its successive government and vital actions of State, which shall be our second or <HI>Historical Tome,</HI>
containing the five last Books. And here first we will (by example of the best Anatomists) propose
to view the <HI>whole Body</HI> and <HI>Monarchy</HI> entire (as far as conveniently we could comprise it) and
after will dissect and lay open the particular Members, Veins, and Ioynts, (I mean the Shires, Ri|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s,
Cities, and Towns) with such things as shall occur most worthy our regard, and most behove|ful
for our use.</P>
<P>(2) The Isl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of <HI>Great Britain</HI> (which with her adjoyning Isles is here first presented) contain|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th
the Kingdomes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is of many accounted the greatest Island in the
<HI>World,</HI> though <HI>Iustus Lypsius</HI> gives that praise to <HI>Cuba</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as the Oriental Navigators do
unto <HI>Sumatra</HI> (taken for <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">olomy's Tapro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aria</HI>) or to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> the Island of S. <HI>Laurence,</HI> both which
are near unto, or under the Equi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">octial Line; in which we will not contend: as pleasing our selves
<PB REF="6">
with her other praises greater than her <HI>Greatness:</HI> yet with this honour also, that it was (without que|stion)
the greatest Island of the <HI>Roman World,</HI> and for any thing yet certainly known, of all the rest.
Concerning whose positure in respect of <HI>Heaven, Lucretius</HI> (the first of the Latin Writers that names
<HI>Britain</HI>) seemeth to place it in the same Parallel with <HI>Pontus,</HI> where he saith:
<Q><L>Nam quid Britannum coelum differre putamus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>What differs Britains Heaven from that of Nile?</L>
<L>Or Pontus welkin from Gades warmer Ile?</L></Q>
In which, by a certain cross comparison, he opposeth two likes against two unlikes, <HI>Britain</HI> and
<HI>Pontus</HI> against <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Gades.</HI> But to seek into profound Antiquity, rather than present practice,
for matters in which <HI>Vse makes perfectness,</HI> were to affect the giving light by shadows, rather than
by Sun-shine.</P>
<P>(3) It is by experience found to lie included form the degree fifty, and thirty scruples of La|titude,
and for Longitude extended from the 13. degree, and 20. minutes, unto the 22. and 50. mi|nutes,
according to the observation of <HI>Mercator.</HI> It hath <HI>Britain, Normandy,</HI> and other parts of
<HI>France</HI> upon the South; the <HI>Lower Germany, Denmark&punc;</HI> and <HI>Norway</HI> upon the East; the Isles of <HI>Ork|ney</HI>
and the <HI>Deucaledonian Sea,</HI> upon the North; the <HI>Hebrides</HI> upon the West, and from it all other
Islands and Ilets, which do scatteredly inviron it, and shelter themselves (as it were) under the sha|dow
of <HI>Great Albion</HI> (another name of this famous Island) are also accounted Britannish, and are
therefore here described all together.</P>
<P>(4) <HI>Britain</HI> thus seated in the Ocean hath her praises, not only in the present sense, and use of
her commodities, but also in those honourable Eulogies, which the learnedst of <HI>Antiquaries</HI> hath col|lected
out of the noblest Authors, that he scarce seemeth to have left any gleanings: neither will we
transplant them out of his flourishing Gardens, but as necessity compels, sith nothing can be further
or otherwise better said.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">(5) That <HI>Britain</HI> therefore is the Seas High <HI>Admiral,</HI> is famously known: and the <HI>Fortunate
Island</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">upposed by some, as <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Amesbury</HI> doth shew: whose Air is more temperate (saith <HI>Cae|sar</HI>)
then <HI>France;</HI> whose s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">yl bringeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Grain in abundance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aith <HI>Tacitus;</HI> whose Seas pro|duce
orient Pearl, saith <HI>Suetonius;</HI> whose Fields are the seat of a Summer Queen, saith <HI>Orpheus;</HI>
her wildest parts free from wild beasts, saith the ancient <HI>Panegyrick;</HI> and her chief City worthily
named <HI>Augusta,</HI> as saith <HI>Ammianus:</HI> So as we may truly say with the royal <HI>Psalmist, Our lines are
fallen in pleasant places, yea, we have a fair inheritance.</HI> Which whatsoever by the goodness of God,
and industry of man it is now, yet our English <HI>Poet</HI> hath truly described unto the first face thereof,
thus;
<Q><L>The Land which warlike <HI>Britains</HI> now possess,</L>
<L>And therein have their mighty Empires rais'd,</L>
<L>In ancient times was savage Wilderness,</L>
<L>Vnpeopled, unmanur'd, unprov'd&punc; unprais'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>(6) And albeit the Ocean doth at this present thrust it self between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Callis,</HI> dividing
them with a deep and vast entrenchment; so that <HI>Britain</HI> thereby is of a supposed <HI>Penisle</HI> made an
Island, yet divers have stifly held, that once it was joyned by an arm of land to the Continent of
<HI>Gallia.</HI> To which opinion <HI>Spencer</HI> farther alluding, thus closeth his Stanza.
<Q><L>Ne was it Island then&punc; ne was it paisde</L>
<L>Amid the Ocean waves, ne was it sought</L>
<L>Of Merchants far, for profits therein prasde,</L>
<L>But was all desolate, and of some thought</L>
<L>By Sea to have been from the Celtick Mainland brought.</L></Q>
Which as a matter meerly conjectural (because it is not plain that there were no Islands nor Hills
<PB REF="7">
bofore <HI>Noahs</HI> floud) I leave at large: <HI>Virgil</HI> surely (of all <HI>Poets</HI> the most learned) when describing
the Shield which <HI>Vulcan</HI> forged (in <HI>Virgils</HI> brain) for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> he calls the <HI>Morini</HI> (people about <HI>Calis)
the outmost men,</HI> doth only mean that they were Westward, the furthest inhabitants upon the Con|tinent,
signifying that <HI>Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ain</HI> as being an Island, lay out of the World, but yet not out of the
knowledge of men, for the Commodities thereof invited the famous Greek Colonies of Mer|chants,
Which dwelt at <HI>Marsilia</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> to venture hither, as hath been well observed out of
<HI>Strabo.</HI></P>
<P>(7) And as <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> was the first <HI>Roman</HI> which ever gave an attempt to conquer it, so will
we close its praises with a late Epigram, concerning the outward face of the Isle, and the motive of
<HI>Caesars</HI> coming.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Albionis</HI> vertex frondoso crine superbus.</L>
<L>Arboreas frondes plurimus ales habet.</L>
<L>Gramineam Montes &amp; fundunt pascua pubem;</L>
<L>Et carpunt, circum pascua gramen oves:</L>
<L>Sed Latii caruit potioribus Insula donis,</L>
<L>Victori potior Gloria ni <HI>Latio.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L><HI>Albions</HI> high tops her woody locks far shew,</L>
<L>With Quires of chanting Birds these Woods resounding,</L>
<L>Her Downs and Meadows clad in verdant hew,</L>
<L>Meadows and Downs with Flocks and Heards abounding,</L>
<L><HI>Latium</HI> had greater Wealth, yet <HI>Caesar</HI> thought,</L>
<L>To <HI>British</HI> Glory, <HI>Latiums</HI> Wealth worth nought.</L></Q>
<P><PB REF="8">(8) The division of <HI>Britain</HI> concerning the government and territories thereof, at such time as
<HI>Caesar</HI> here arrived, doth not sufficiently appear. <HI>Caesar</HI> himself makes so sparing mention therein,
that we have little cause to believe <HI>Florus,</HI> where he makes <HI>Livie</HI> say, that after <HI>Caesar</HI> had slain an
huge multitude of <HI>Britaines,</HI> he <HI>subdued the residue of the Isle;</HI> but rather with exq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">isite <HI>Horace,</HI> that he
did not at all touch them, as the word <HI>inactus</HI> doth in him purport.</P>
<P>(9) Kings they were, and therefore that division which was here in <HI>Caesars</HI> time, was into <HI>Kingdoms:</HI>
the old names of whole Nations, as also the knowledge of their several abodes, hidden under the
rubbish of so many ages, have of late with infinite labours and exquisite judgment, been probably
restored and abounded; yet that no mans expectation and desire be too much frustrated, reason
wills that we briefly set forth such divisions of the Land, as many repute not ancient only, but au|thentick.</P>
<P>(10) Our seeming ancient Historians begin it at <HI>Brute,</HI> who to every of his three sons gave a part
called presently after by their names; as <HI>Loegria</HI> to <HI>Locrine</HI> his eldest son; <HI>Cambria</HI> to <HI>Camber</HI> his second
son; and <HI>Albania</HI> to <HI>Albanist</HI> his third son: And doubtless, if there had been more Nations of fame
in this Island, <HI>Brute</HI> should have had more sons fathered on him; which conceit some ascribe to
<HI>Monmouth</HI>'s holding that before him it was never so divided.</P>
<P>(11) <HI>Ptolomy</HI> naming <HI>Britain</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> and the <HI>Less,</HI> hath been by some mistaken, as so dividing this
Island into two parts; But his proportion and distance from the <HI>Aequator,</HI> compared with his Geo|graphical
description will evince, that he calleth this our Island <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and <HI>Ireland Britain</HI> the
<HI>Less.</HI></P>
<P>(12) Howbeit some later do make indeed the South and more Champion to be called <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
and the North more Mountainous, <HI>Britain the Less;</HI> whose inhabitants anciently were distinguish|ed
into the <HI>Majatae,</HI> and <HI>Caledo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ii,</HI> and now by the <HI>Scots</HI> are into <HI>Heilandmen,</HI> and <HI>Lawland|men.</HI>
<PB REF="8">
But that <HI>Northern</HI> clime being more piercing for the <HI>Roman</HI> constitutions, and <HI>less profitable or
fruitful,</HI> they set their bounds not far from <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and altogether neglected the other parts more
Northward.</P>
<P>(13) This nearer part of <HI>Britain</HI> they then divided into two parts; for the more Southern tract, toge|ther
with <HI>Wales, Dio</HI> termeth the <HI>Higher,</HI> and that more Northward the <HI>Lower,</HI> as by the seats of their
Legions doth appear; for the second <HI>Legion Augusta</HI> (which kept at <HI>Caerleon</HI> in <HI>South Wales</HI>) and the
twentieth called <HI>Victrix,</HI> (which remained at <HI>Chester</HI>) he placeth in the higher <HI>Britain</HI> but the sixt
<HI>Legion</HI> sirnamed also <HI>Victrix,</HI> resident at <HI>York,</HI> served (as he writeth) in the <HI>Lower Britain,</HI> which
division, as seemeth, was made by <HI>Severus</HI> the Emperour, who having vanquished <HI>Albinus,</HI> General
of the <HI>Britains,</HI> and reduced their State under his obedience, divided the government thereof into
two provinces, and placed two Prefects over the same.</P>
<P>(14) After this again the <HI>Romans</HI> did apportion <HI>Britain</HI> into three parts, whose limits our <HI>great An|tiquary</HI>
assigneth by the ancient <HI>Archiepiscopal</HI> Seats, grounding his conjecture on the saying of Pope
<HI>Lucius,</HI> who affirmeth that the Ecclesiastical Iurisdictions of the Christians, accorded with the pre|cincts
of the Roman Magistrates, and that their Archb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">shops had their Sees in those Cities wherein
their Presidents abode: so that the ancient Seats of the three Archb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">shops here, being <HI>London</HI> in the
East, <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erleon</HI> in the West, and <HI>York</HI> in the North; <HI>Londons</HI> Diocess (as seemeth) made <HI>Britain prima,
Caerleon Britain secunda;</HI> and <HI>York, Maxima Caesari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nsis.</HI></P>
<P>(15) But in the next age, when the power of their Presidents began to grow over great, they again
divided <HI>Britain</HI> into five parts, adding to the three former <HI>Valentia</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lavia Caesariensis:</HI> the first of
which two seemeth to have been the Northerly part of <HI>Maxima Caesariensis,</HI> recovered from the <HI>Picts</HI>
and <HI>Scots</HI> by <HI>Theodo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lus</HI> the General under <HI>Valence</HI> the Emperour, and in honour of him named <HI>Vale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|tia:</HI>
and <HI>Flavia</HI> may be conjectured to receive the name from <HI>Flavius</HI> the Emperour (son of <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sius</HI>)
for that we read not of the name <HI>Britain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lavia,</HI> before his time.</P>
<P><PB REF="9">(16) So these five partitions had their limits assigned after this manner: <HI>Britaine prima</HI> contained
those coasts that lay betwixt <HI>Thamesis,</HI> the <HI>Severne,</HI> and the <HI>British Sea: Britaine Secunda</HI> extended from
<HI>Severne</HI> unto the <HI>Irish Seas,</HI> containing the Countrey that we now call <HI>Wales: Flavia Caesariensis,</HI> was
that which lay betwixt the Rivers <HI>Humber</HI> and <HI>Tyne:</HI> and <HI>Valentia</HI> from the said River, and <HI>Picts wall</HI>
reached unto the Rampire near <HI>Edenburgh</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the farthest part that the <HI>Romans</HI> possessed
when this division was in use. For the several people inhabiting all those parts, with their ancient
Names and Borders (whether designed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> or the old <HI>Britains</HI>) together with our modern
<HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Shires,</HI> answerable to each of them, we will refer you to the Tables thereof elsewhere.</P>
<P>(17) This whole Province of <HI>Britain,</HI> as in our History shall appear, was highly esteemed of the
Emperours themselves, assuming as a glorious surname <HI>Britannicus:</HI> coming thither in person over
those dangerous and scarce known Seas; here marrying, living, and dying: enacting here Laws for
the whole Empire, and giving to those Captains that served here, many ensigns of great honour;
yea <HI>Claudius</HI> gave <HI>Plantius</HI> (the first Prefect of that Province) the right hand, as he accompanied
him in his Triumph; and his own Triumph of <HI>Britain</HI> was set out with such magnificence, that the
Provinces brought in golden Crowes of great weight, the Governours commanded to attend, and
the very Captains permitted to be present at the same: A Naval Coronet was fixed upon a Pinnacle
of his Palace, Arches and Trophies were raised in <HI>Rome,</HI> and himself on his aged knees mounted the
staires into the Capitol, supported by his two sons in Law: so great a joy conceived he in himself for
the Conquest of some small portion of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>(18) Now the <HI>Romans</HI> found it, held it, and left it, as times ripened and rottened their success, with
the Names, the Inhabitants, Manners, and Resisters, I leave to be pursued in the following Histories:
and will only now shew thee these three Kingdoms, that are (in present) the chief Bodies of <HI>Great
Britains Monarchy;</HI> two of which (<HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>) shall in their due places have their farther
and more particular Descriptions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Saxons</HI> glory now near to expire, by his appointment who holdeth both times and
Kingdoms in his all-ordering hand, their own Swords being the Instruments, and the
<HI>Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> the mauls that beat their beautiful Diadem into pieces&punc; the <HI>Normans</HI> a stirring
Nation, (neither expected, nor much feared) under the leading of <HI>William</HI> their Duke,
and encouragement of the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop (an usual promoter of broken titles) made
hither suddenly into <HI>England,</HI> who in one only battel, with the title of his sword and slaughter of <HI>Ha|rold,</HI>
set the imperial Crown thereof upon his own head: which no sooner was done, but the <HI>English</HI>
went down, and the <HI>Normans</HI> lording it, became <HI>Owners of those Cities which themselves never built, pos|sessed
those Vineyards which they never planted, drunk of those Wells which they never had digged, and inha|bited
those Houses, filled with riches, for which they never had laboured:</HI> for they found it to be as the <HI>land
whereupon the Lord set his eye, even from the beginning to the end of the year:</HI> not only <HI>drinking water of the
rain of Heaven,</HI> but having also <HI>rivers of waters and fountains in her valleys, and without all scarcitie,
whose stones are Iron, and out of whose mountains is digged brass.</HI> This made them more resolute at first to
settle themselves in this fairest and fruitfullest part of the Island; the conquerour using all policy,
both Martial and Civil, to plant his posterity here for ever. How he found the Land governed we
shewed in the <HI>Heptarchy;</HI> but his restless thoughts were not contented with conquering the Nation
and their Land, unless he also overcame their very <HI>Customes, Laws,</HI> and <HI>Language.</HI></P>
<P>(2) Touching the distribution of the Kingdome, whereas other Kings before him made use of it,
chiefly for the good of the people, and better ministring of Iustice, he made use of it, to know the
wealth of his Subjects, and to enrich his Coffers; for <HI>he caused a description to be made of all England,
<PB REF="10">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ow much land every one of his Barons possessed how many Knights fees, how many Plow-lands, how many
in villanage, how many heads of beasts, yea, how much ready money every man, from the greatest to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ast,
did possess, and what rents might be made of every mans possession:</HI> the Book of which inquisition (yet
in the Exchequer) was called <HI>Doomesday,</HI> for the generality of that Iudgment on all the Land:
Whereunto we may add his other distribution of this Land (worse than any former) when <HI>thrusting
the English out of their possessions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e distributed their inheritances to his Souldiers; yet so, that all should be
held of the King, as of the only true Lord and possessor.</HI></P>
<P>(3) For the Laws by which he meant to govern, he held one excellent rule and purpose, which
was, that <HI>a people ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">to be ruled by Laws written and certain:</HI> for otherwise new Iudges would
still bring new Iudgments: and therefore he caused <HI>twelve to be chosen out of every County, which
should on their oath, without inclining one way or other, neither adding nor de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">racting, open unto him all their
ancient Laws and Customes.</HI> By whose relation understanding that three sorts of Laws former|ly
were in the Land, <HI>Merchelenage, West-Saxonlage, Dane-lage;</HI> he had preferred these last, (him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">elf
and people being anciently derived from those Northern people) had not all the Barons beway|ling
to the King, <HI>how grievous it was for a Land to be judged by those Laws which they understood not,</HI>
altered his resolute purpose: yet in bringing in the strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orms of <HI>Norman</HI> Processe, and pleading in
the <HI>French</HI> tongue (which continued till <HI>Edward</HI> the thirds time) that grievance was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> slend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rly
prevented. So likewise did he much alter the old Courts of Iustice, where these Laws shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d be
ministred, but whereas the ancient Kings of <HI>England,</HI> ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ording to <HI>Moses</HI> his example, sate in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rson

<P>(9) To speak nothing of these twenty eight Flamins the Priests of Idolatry, and the three
Arch-Flamins, whose seats were at <HI>London, Caerlion,</HI> and <HI>York;</HI> all of them converted by King <HI>Lu|cius</HI>
into Christian Bishops Sees; let us only insist upon the three last, by the same King appointed to
be Metropolitanes over the rest; among whom <HI>London</HI> is said to be chief; whose first Christian Arch|bishop
was <HI>Thean,</HI> the builder of S. <HI>Peters</HI> Church in <HI>Cornhill</HI> for his <HI>Cathedral,</HI> as by an ancient
Table there hanging, was affirmed, and tradition to this day doth hold. Our <HI>British</HI> Histori|ans
do bring a succession of fifteen Arch-bishops, to have sate from his time unto the coming of the
<HI>Saxons,</HI> whose last was <HI>Vodius,</HI> slain by King <HI>Vortiger,</HI> for reprehending his heathenish marriage
with <HI>Rowen,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Hengist.</HI> At what time began the misery of the Land, and of holy Reli|gion,

both which they laid waste under their prophane feet: until <HI>Ethelbert</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> the first Christi|an

<P>(6) At <HI>Caerlion</HI> upon <HI>Vske</HI> in the time of the great <HI>Arthur,</HI> sate <HI>Dubritius,</HI> a man excellently learned,
and of an hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> conversation; he had sate Bishop of <HI>Landaffe</HI> a long time, and with <HI>Germanus</HI> and <HI>Lupus,</HI>
two <HI>French</HI> Bishops, greatly impugned the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Heresie, infecting at that time the Island very

of life, who by consent of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> removed his Archbishops See unto <HI>Menevia,</HI> a place ve|ry
solitary and meet for meditation: the miracles of the man (which are said to be many) changed
both the name of the place into his own, and robbed <HI>Caerlion</HI> of her Archiepiscopal seat: This See
of S. <HI>Davids</HI> (as in an ancient Register belonging to that Church is recorded) had seven Bishops
Suffragans subject unto it, which were <HI>Exeter, Bath, Hereford, Landaffe, Bangor,</HI> S. <HI>Asap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and

<HI>Sampson,</HI> in a dangerous infection of sickness, or by poverty or negligence, it lost that jurisdiction,
and in the days of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, became subject to the See of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>(7) <HI>York</HI> hath had better succes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> than either of the former, in retaining her original honour, though
much impaired in her circuit, challenging to have been sometime Metropolitane over all the Bishops
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and although it was made equal in honour and power with <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by Pope <HI>Gregory,</HI>
as <HI>Beda</HI> relateth, and had twelve suffragan Bishopricks that owed obedience, onely four now ac|knowledge
<HI>York</HI> their Metropolitane, but <HI>Canterbury</HI> the Superiour: for <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour
thinking it dangerous to have two in like authority, lest the one should set on his Crown, and the o|ther

<P><PB REF="15">(8) That <HI>Lichfield</HI> was made an Archiepiscopal See by Pope <HI>Hadrian</HI> the first, at the suit of <HI>Offa,</HI>
the great King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> is manifested by <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> unto whose Iurisdiction were as|signed
the Bishopricks of <HI>Winchester, Hereford, Leicester, Sidnacester, Helmham,</HI> and <HI>Dunwich,</HI> and
whose first and last Archbishop was <HI>Aldwin.</HI> That <HI>Winchester</HI> also had intended an Archiepiscopal
Pall, the same Author recordeth, when <HI>Henry Bloys,</HI> of the Bloud Royal, greatly contended with the
Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for superiority, under the pretence of being Cardinal <HI>de latere;</HI> to him an
Archiepiscopal Pall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> was sent, with power and authority over seven Churches; but he dying before
that the design was done, the See of <HI>Winchester</HI> remained in subjection to <HI>Canterbury.</HI> And that
(long before) the See of <HI>Dorchester</HI> by <HI>Oxford,</HI> had the Iurisdiction of an Archbishop, is apparent
by those provinces that were under his Diocess, which were <HI>Winchester, Oxford, Lincoln, Salisbury,
Bristow, Wells, Litchfield, Chester,</HI> and <HI>Exeter;</HI> and the first Bishop of this great circuit, <HI>Derinus,</HI> was
called the Apostle and Bishop of the West <HI>Saxons:</HI> which in his next successor was divided into two
parts, <HI>Winchester</HI> and <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and not long after into <HI>Lichfield, Sidnacester,</HI> and <HI>Legecister;</HI> and last|ly,
the See removed from <HI>Dorchester</HI> to <HI>Lincoln,</HI> as now it is. And thus far for the division of this
Realm, both Politick and Ecclesiastick, as it hath stood and stands at this day.</P>
<P>(9) But the whole Islands division by most certain Record was anciently made, when <HI>Iulius Agri|cola</HI>
drew a trench or fortification upon that narrow space of ground betwixt <HI>Edenborough Frith,</HI> and
<HI>Dunbetton Bay,</HI> maketh the Southern part a province unto the Roman Empire. Afterwards <HI>Hadrian</HI>
the Emperour, seeing perhaps the Province too spacious to be well governed without great expence,
drew back these limits almost sourscore miles shorter, even to the mouth of the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> which
he fortified with a wall of admirable work unto <HI>Carl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">le,</HI> where stood the Lands border, while it
was a <HI>Roman</HI> Province: yet the conquering <HI>Saxons</HI> did spread again over those bounds, and (as
seemeth) enlarged their government to that first Tract, as by this inscription in a Stone Cross stand|ing
upon a Bridge over the water of <HI>Frith,</HI> appeareth.</P>
<Q><PB REF="16"><L>I am a free Mark as Passengers may ken,</L>
<L>To Scots, to Britains, and to English men.</L></Q>
<P>(10) But afterward <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and <HI>Malcolm</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> falling to an agree|ment
for their limits&punc; arreared a Cross upon <HI>Stanemore,</HI> where on the one side the portraiture and
Armes of the King of <HI>England</HI> was sculptured, and of the King of <HI>Scots</HI> on the other (a piece
whereof is yet remaining there near to the Spittle) thence called the Rey-Cross, there erected to
be a Meare-stone to either Kingdome. His successors also abolished the two partitions in the West,
whereby the <HI>Welsh</HI> became one Nation and Kingdome with the <HI>English.</HI> It is also said that King
<HI>Stephen,</HI> to purchase friendship with the <HI>Scottish Nation,</HI> gave unto their King the County of <HI>Cum|berland,</HI>
who with it held both <HI>Westmorland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland;</HI> but as <HI>Newbrigensis</HI> writeth, he
restored them to King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, wisely considering his great power and right to those
parts.</P>
<P>(11) The last known borders were from the <HI>Sulway</HI> in the West bay, along the <HI>Cheviot</HI> hills, un|to
the water of <HI>Tweed</HI> by <HI>Barwick</HI> in the East; to maintain which, on each part many Laws have
been made, and many inrodes, robberies, and fewdes practised; all which by the hand of God is
cut off, and by the rightfull succession of King <HI>Iames</HI> our Soveraigne, who hath broken down the
partition of this great Island, and made the extreames of two Kingdomes, the very midst of his great
united Empire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>KENT, the first province appearing in the South of this Kingdom, is bounded upon the
North with the famous River <HI>Thamisis,</HI> on the East with the <HI>German Ocean:</HI> on the South
with <HI>Sussex</HI> and the narrow Seas&punc; and upon the West with <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Surrey.</HI> The length
thereof extending from <HI>Langley</HI> in the West, unto <HI>Ramsgate</HI> Eastward in the Isle of
<HI>Thanet,</HI> is about 53 English miles. From <HI>Rother</HI> in the South, unto the Isle of <HI>Graine</HI>
Northward, the breadth is not much above 26, and the whole circumference about 160 miles.</P>
<P>(2) In form it somewhat resembleth the head of a Hammer or Battle-axe, and lieth corner-wise
into the Sea; by <HI>Strabo, Caesar, Diodorus,</HI> and <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">olomy,</HI> called <HI>Cantium,</HI> of <HI>Cant,</HI> or <HI>Canton,</HI> an <HI>Angle</HI> or
<HI>Corner:</HI> or of <HI>Caine</HI> a <HI>British</HI> word, which signifieth <HI>Bushes</HI> or <HI>VVoods,</HI> whereof that County in
those former times was plentifully stored.</P>
<P>(3) The Air though not very clear, because of the vapours arising from the Sea, and Rivers
that environ the same, is both wholesome and temperate, as seated nearest to the <HI>Equinoctial,</HI> and the
furthest from the <HI>North Pole,</HI> not touched with cold as the other parts of the Land are.</P>
<P>(4) The soil towards the East is uneven, rising into little hills, the West more level and Woody;
in all places fruitful, and in plenty equals any other of the Realm, yea, and in some things hath the
best esteem; as in broad cloths, Fruits, and feeding for Cattel. Onely Mines (except Iron) are
wanting: all things else delivered with a prodigal heart and liberal hand.</P>
<P>(5) Sundry navigable Rivers are in <HI>Kent,</HI> whereof <HI>Medway,</HI> that divideth the shire in the midst,
is chief; in whose bosome securely rideth his Majesties <HI>Navy Royal,</HI> the walls of the Land, and ter|rours
of the Sea, besides ten other of name and account, that open with twenty Creeks and Ha|vens

<HI>England;</HI> and by <HI>Iohn Rosse</HI> and <HI>Lidgate</HI> is said to be built by <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> fatal only for the death of
King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and surrender of King <HI>Iohn</HI> therein happening.</P>
<P>(6) A conceit is, that <HI>Goodwin Sands</HI> were sunk for the sins of himself and his sons: Shelves
indeed that dangerously lie on the North-east of this County, and are much feared of all <HI>Naviga|tors.</HI>
These formerly had been firm ground, but by a sudden inundation of the Sea were swallowed
up, as at the same time a great part of <HI>Flanders</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries</HI> were; and the like also at the
same time befel in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as <HI>Hector Boetius</HI> their Historiographer writeth. A like accident hapned
in the year 1586, the fourth day of <HI>August,</HI> in this County, at <HI>Mottingham,</HI> a Town eight miles from
<HI>London,</HI> suddenly the ground began to sink, and three great Elmes thereon growing, were carried
so deep into the bowels of the earth, that no part of them could any more be seen, the hole left
in compass fourscore yards about, and a line of fifty fathoms plummed into it, doth find no bot|tom.</P>
<P>(7) The Kentish people in <HI>Caesars</HI> time were accounted the civillest among the <HI>Britains;</HI> and as
yet esteem themselves the freest Subjects of the <HI>English,</HI> not conquered, but compounded with by
the <HI>Normans;</HI> and herein glory, that their King and Commons of all the <HI>Saxons</HI> were the first Christians,
converted in <HI>Anno</HI> 596; yea, and long before that time also <HI>Kent</HI> received the Faith: for it is recorded
that <HI>Lucius</HI> the first Christian <HI>British</HI> King in this Island, built a Church to the name and service of
Christ, within the Castle of <HI>Dover,</HI> endowing it with the Toll of the same Haven.</P>
<P>(8) This County is enriched with two Cities and Bishops Sees, strengthened with 27 Castles,
graced with 8 of His Majesties most Princely Houses, traded with 24 Market-Towns, and
<PB REF="18">
beautified with many stately and gorgeous buildings. The chiefest Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y thereof, the Motropolitane
and Arch-bishops See, is <HI>Canterbury,</HI> bui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t (as our <HI>British Historians</HI> report) 900 years before the
birth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hrist; by <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington,</HI> called <HI>Caier-Kent,</HI> wherein (as M. <HI>Lambard</HI> saith) was ere|cted

of the <HI>East Angles,</HI> for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> foundation at <HI>Cambridge;</HI> notwithstanding by the computation of time,
this <HI>Sigibert</HI> was slain by <HI>Penda,</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> thirty years before that <HI>Theodore</HI> the <HI>Grecian</HI> was Bi|shop
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who is said to be the erector of that Academy. But certain it is, that <HI>Austin</HI> the
Monk had made this City famous before that time, by the conversion of these <HI>Saxons</HI> unto Christiani|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y,
and in building a most magnificent Church to Gods service, wherein eight of their Kings have
been interred, but all their Monuments since over-shadowed by the height of <HI>Beckets</HI> Tomb, that
for glory, wealth, and superstitious worships, equalized the <HI>Pyramides of Egypt,</HI> or the <HI>Oracle of
Delphos,</HI> yet now with <HI>Dagon</HI> is fallen before the <HI>Ark of God.</HI></P>
<P>This City hath been honoured with the presence and Coronations of King <HI>Iohn</HI> and Queen
<HI>Isabel</HI> his wife, with the marriages of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and with
the interments of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and of Queen <HI>Ioan</HI> his wife: as <HI>Fe|versham</HI>
is with the burials of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and of <HI>Maud</HI> his Queen and wife. But as in glory so in
adversity hath this City born a part, being divers times afflicted by the <HI>Danes,</HI> but most especially
in the dayes of <HI>Ethelred,</HI> who in that revenge of their massacre, made havock of all, and herein
slew forty three thousand and two hundred persons, the tenth besides reserved to live. Afterward
it recovered breath and beauty by the liberality of Bishop <HI>Lanford;</HI> Characters and priviledges by King
<HI>Henry</HI> the third; strength in Trench and Fortifications from King <HI>Richard</HI> the second; and lastly, Walls
for her defence by <HI>Simon Sudbury</HI> Arch-bishop of that See: whose Graduation is placed for Latitude
51. 25, and parallelized for Longitude 22. 8, her sister <HI>Rochester</HI> differing not much in either degree.</P>
<P><PB REF="18">(9) Which City (as <HI>Beda</HI> saith) was built by one <HI>Rof,</HI> Lord of the same, though some ascribe the

in the times when the <HI>Saxons</HI> strove for superiority among themselves, wherein this City was laid

Nobility, for the consecration of the Cathedral Church of S. <HI>Andrew.</HI> And again almost wholly
consumed about the latter end of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Anno</HI> 1177. Yet after all these
calamities, it recovered some strength again, by the bounty of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, both in buil|dings,
and in ditching her about for defence.</P>
<P>(10) Civil broyls and dissentions hath this County been burdened with, and that not only un|der
the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> whose desolations were many and grievous, but also by other rebellions
since the <HI>Normans</HI> Conquest, both in those infamous insurrections, called <HI>The Barons Wars,</HI> in the
reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, wherein much harm was done: as also under King <HI>Richard</HI> the
Second, when <HI>Wat Tyler,</HI> Captain of a dreadful commotion, assembled at <HI>Black-heath, Mile-end,</HI> and
in <HI>London,</HI> doing many outrages, where in <HI>Smithfield</HI> he was lastly struck down by <HI>William VVallworth</HI>
then Mayor of the City, and worthily slain for his notorious treasons. Again, upon <HI>Black-heath,
Michael Ioseph,</HI> the Lord <HI>Dawbeney</HI> with their Cornish Rebels, were overthrown by King <HI>Henry</HI> the
Seventh, <HI>Anno</HI> 1497.</P>
<P><PB REF="19">(11) <HI>Kent</HI> in the time of <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> was governed by four several Kings. Under <HI>Vortigern</HI> the

<P>SOUTH-SEX, a word compounded of the site thereof Southward, lieth stretched along the
<HI>British Seas:</HI> The North confronts upon <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> and the West butteth upon <HI>Hamp|shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) For form it lieth long and narrow, so that all her Rapes do run quite through the
Shire, and containeth from <HI>Westharting</HI> in the West, to <HI>Kent</HI> ditch, that divides it from <HI>Kent</HI> in the
East, sixty four miles, but in the broadest part little above twenty, the whole circumference about
one hundred fifty eight miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is good, though somewhat clouded with mists, which arise forth of her South bor|dering
Sea, who is very prodigal unto her for Fish and Sea-fowl, though as sparing for Harbours
or Ships arrivage; and those which she hath, as uncertain for continuance, as dangerous for en|trance.</P>
<P>(4) Rich is the Soil, and yieldeth great plenty of all things necessary, but very ill for travellers,
especially in the winter, the Land lying low, and the ways very deep, whose middle tract is garni|shed
with Meadows, Pastures and Corn fields, the Sea-coast with Hills, which are called the
<HI>Downs,</HI> abundantly yielding both <HI>Grain</HI> and <HI>Grass,</HI> and the North side over shadowed with plea|sant
Groves and thick Woods, where sometimes stood the famous wood <HI>Andradswald,</HI> containing
no less than an hundred and twenty miles in length, and thirty in breadth, taking the name of
<HI>Andexida</HI> a City adjoyning: both which were won from the <HI>Britains</HI> by <HI>Ella</HI> the first <HI>Saxon</HI> King of
this Province, and the place made fatal to <HI>Sigebert</HI> King of the <HI>VVest-Saxens,</HI> who being deposed
<PB REF="20">
from his Royal throne, was met in this Wood by a Swine-herd, and slain in revenge of his Lord,
whom <HI>Sigebert</HI> had nurdered.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient people in the <HI>Romans</HI> time were the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gni,</HI> of whom we have spoken, and who
were subdued by <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Leader of the second Legion under <HI>Aulus, Plautius,</HI> Lieutenant in <HI>Bri|tain</HI>

in these parts.</P>
<P>(6) The place of most account in this Shire is <HI>Chichester,</HI> by the <HI>Britains</HI> called <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ercei,</HI> a City
beautifull and large, and very well walled about, first built by <HI>Cissa</HI> the second King of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">outh Sax|ons,</HI>
wherein his Royal Palace was kept. And when King <HI>VVilliam</HI> the First had enacted that <HI>Bishops
Sees</HI> should be trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ted out of small Towns unto places of greater resort, the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">idence of the
Bishop (until then held at <HI>Selsey</HI>) was removed to this City, where Bishop <HI>Raulfe</HI> began a most
goodly Cathedral Church: but before it was fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly finished by a sudden mischance of fire was
quite consumed. Yet the same Bishop with the helping liberality of King <HI>Henry</HI> the First, began
it again, and saw it wholly finished; whose beauty and greatness her fatal enemy still envying, a|gain
cast down in the dayes of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, and by her raging flames consumed the
buildings both of it and the Bishops Palace adjoyning, which <HI>Seffrid</HI> the second Bishop of that
Name re-edified and built anew. And now to augment the honour of this place, the City hath
born the Title of an <HI>Earldome;</HI> whereof they of <HI>Arundel</HI> were sometimes so styled. Whose Gra|duation
for Latitude, which is removed from the Aequator unto the degree fifty five minutes; and
for Longitude, observing the same point in the West, whence <HI>Mercator</HI> hath measured, are twenty
degrees.</P>
<P><PB REF="21">(7) With whom for frequency, bigness, and building, the Town <HI>Lewes</HI> seemeth to contend,
where King <HI>Athelstane</HI> appointed the mintage of his Moneys, and <HI>VVilliam de VVarron</HI> built a strong Ca|stle,
whereunto the disloyal <HI>Barons</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third in warlike manner resorted, and fought
a great Battle against their own Soveraign and his son, wherein the King had his Horse flain un|der
him, <HI>Richard,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans</HI> surprised and taken in a Wind-mill, and Prince <HI>Edward</HI> deli|vered
unto them upon equal conditions of peace. But a greater Battel was fought at <HI>Battle,</HI> when
the hazard of <HI>England</HI> was tried in one days fight, and <HI>Harold</HI> the King gave place to his <HI>Conquerour</HI>

very fresh bloud out of the earth, as if the evidence thereof did plainly declare the voice of bloud there shed,
and cried still from the earth unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>(8) But places of other note in this Shire are these: from <HI>Basham,</HI> Earl <HI>Harold</HI> taking the Sea for
his delight, in a small Boat, was driven upon the Coast of <HI>Normandy,</HI> where by Duke <HI>William</HI> he was
retained, 'till he had sworn to make him King after <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessors</HI> death; which oath being bro|ken,

of <HI>Orleance,</HI> father to <HI>Lewes</HI> the twelfth: King of <HI>France,</HI> taken prisoner at <HI>Agincourt,</HI> was there a
long time detained.</P>
<P>(9) The commodities of this Province are many and divers, both in <HI>Corn, Cattle, VVood, Iron,</HI> and
<HI>Glass;</HI> which two last, as they bring great gain to their possessors, so do they impoverish
<PB REF="21">
the County of Woods, whose want will be found in ages to come, if not at this present in some
sort felt.</P>
<P>(10) Great have been the devotions of religious Persons, in building and consecrating many
houses unto the use and only service of Christ; whose Beadmen abusing the intents of their Foun|ders,
hath caused those Foundations to lament their own ruins: For in the tempestuous time of
King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, eighteen of them in this County were blown down, whose fruit fell into
the Laps of some that never meant to restore them again to the like use.</P>
<P>This County is principally divided into six Rapes, every of them containing a River, a Castle
and Forrest in themselves, besides the several Hundreds whereunto they are parted, that is the Rape
of <HI>Chichester</HI> into seven, of <HI>Arundel</HI> into five, of <HI>Bramber</HI> into ten, of <HI>Lewes</HI> into thirteen, of <HI>Peven|sey</HI>

circumference is one hundred and twelve miles.</P>
<P>(3) The heavens breathing Air in this Shire is most sweet and delectable, so that for the same
cause many Royal Palaces of our Princes are therein seated, and the Countrey better stored with
game than with grain, insomuch that this County is by some men compared unto a home-spun
freeze-cloth, with a costly fair list, for that the out-verge doth exceed the middle it self. And yet
it is wealthy enough both in Corn and Pasturage, especially in <HI>Holmesdale,</HI> and towards the River of

years after, King <HI>Elfred</HI> with a small power overcame the <HI>Danes</HI> with a great slaughter at <HI>Farnham</HI> in
this County, which somewhat quelled the courage of his savage enemy.</P>
<P>(9) Religious Houses erected in this shire by the devotion of Princes, and set apart from publick
uses to Gods Divine Service, and their own salvation, as then was taught, the best in account,
were <HI>Shene, Chertsey, Merton, Newarke, Rygats, Waverly, Horsleg;</HI> and in <HI>Southwarke, Bermund|sey,</HI>

Father, straightly besieged by the <HI>Britains,</HI> as <HI>Dio</HI> and <HI>Forcatulus</HI> do report, was grasped about with
an Adder, but no hurt to his person, and therefore taken for a sign of good luck. Their chief
Town was <HI>Rincewood,</HI> as yet sounding the name: and more within Land inhabited the <HI>Manures,</HI> as

<HI>Henry</HI> the second son to Duke <HI>Robert,</HI> his first, felt by hasty death the hand of Iustice and Revenge:
for in the same Forrest, <HI>Richard</HI> by blasting of a Pestilent Air, <HI>Rufus</HI> by shot taken for a Beast, and
<HI>Henry</HI> as <HI>Absalom</HI> hanged by a bough, came to their untimely ends. At so dear a rate the pleasures
of Dogs, and harbour for beasts were bought in the bloud of these Princes.</P>
<P>(8) The general Commodities gotten in this Shire, are Wools, Cloaths, and Iron, whereof
great store is therein wrought from the Mines, and thence transported into all parts of this Realm,
and their Cloaths and Karsies carried into many foreign Countries, to that Countries great benefit,
and <HI>Englands</HI> great praise.</P>
<P>(9) The Trade thereof with other provisions for the whole, are vented through eighteen Mar|ket-Towns
in this Shire, whereof <HI>Winchester,</HI> the <HI>Britains Caer Gwent,</HI> the <HI>Romans Venta Belgarum,</HI>
in chief, ancient enough by our <HI>British Historians.</HI> as built by King <HI>Budhudthras,</HI> nine hundred years

over running all, this City felt their fury in the days of King <HI>Ethelbright,</HI> and in the <HI>Normans</HI> time,
twice was defaced by the mis-fortune of fire, which they again repaired and graced with the trust
of keeping the publick Records of the Realm. In the civil wars of <HI>Maud</HI> and <HI>Stephen,</HI> this City
was sore sacked, but again received breath, was by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third appointed the place for

<P>(10) More South, is <HI>South-hampton,</HI> a Town populous, rich and beautiful, from whom the

one thousand and two hundred paces, having seven Gates for entrance, and twenty nine Towers

besides an <HI>Hospital,</HI> called <HI>Gods-house,</HI> wherein the unfortunate <HI>Richard,</HI> Earle of <HI>Cambridge,</HI>

that it gave the <HI>French</HI> direction of course, who with fire had greatly endangered the Town: in|stead
thereof, is newly erected a small and unfinished Chappel. In this place, saith learned <HI>Camb|den,</HI>

to the Sea: this suffered many depredations by the <HI>Saxon</HI> Pirates, and in <HI>Anno</HI> 980. was by the
<HI>Danes</HI> almost quite overthrown. In King <HI>Edward</HI> the thirds time, it was fired by the <HI>French,</HI> under
the Conduct of the King of <HI>Sicils</HI> son, whom a Countrey man encountred and struck down
with his Club, he crying <HI>Rancon, that is Ransome:</HI> but he neither understandiog his language, nor
the Law that Arms doth allow, laid on more soundly, saying, <HI>I know thee a Frankon, and therefore
shalt thou die:</HI> And in <HI>Richard</HI> the seconds time it was somewhat removed, and built in the place where
now it standeth. In this <HI>Clausentium, Canute</HI> to evict his flatterers, made trial of his Deity, commanding
the Seas to keep back from his seat: But being not obeyed, he acknowledged God to be the onely
supreme Governour, and in a religious devotion gave up his Crown to the Rood at <HI>Winchester.</HI>
<PB REF="27">
More ancient was <HI>Silcester</HI> built by <HI>Constantius,</HI> great <HI>Constantines</HI> son; whose Monument (they
say) was seen in in that City, and where another <HI>Constantine</HI> put on the purple robe against <HI>Honorius'</HI>

ground, and the walls of great height, yet standing two miles in compass about. This City by
the <HI>Danish</HI> Rovers suffered such wrack, that her mounted tops were never since seen, and her
Hulke (the walls) immured to the middle of the earth, which the rubbish of her own desolations hath
filled.</P>

<HEAD>VVIGHT ILAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>WIGHT ILAND was in times past named by the <HI>Romans, Vecta, Vectis,</HI> and <HI>Vect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sis,</HI>
by the <HI>Britains, Guyth,</HI> and in these days usually called by us, <HI>The Lsle of Wight,</HI>
it belongeth to the County of <HI>South-hampton,</HI> and lieth out in length over against the
midst of it South-ward. It is encompassed round with the <HI>British</HI> Seas, and severed
from the Main-land, that it may seem to have been conjoyned to it, and thereof it
is thought the <HI>British</HI> name <HI>(Guyth)</HI> hath been given unto it, which betokeneth separation,
even as <HI>Sicily</HI> being broken off and cut from <HI>Italy,</HI> got the name from <HI>Secando</HI> (which signifieth
cutting.)</P>
<P>(2) The form of this Isle is long, and at the midst far more wide than at either end: From <HI>Bin|bridge</HI>
Isle in the East, to <HI>Hurst</HI> Castle in the West, it stretcheth out in length 20 miles, and in breadth
from <HI>Newport</HI> haven Northward, to <HI>Chale-bay</HI> Southward 12 miles. The whole in circumference
is about sixty miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is commended both for health and delight, whereof the first is witnessed by the long
continuance of the Inhabitants in the state of their bodies before they be decayed, and the other
for quantity gives place to no neighbouring Countrey.</P>
<P>(4) The ground (to say nothing of the Sea, which is exceeding full of Fish) consisteth of soil
very fruiful; yet the husbandmans labour deserves to be thankfully remembred, by whose pains
and industry it doth not only supply is self, but affords Corn to be carried forth to others. The
Land is plentifully stored with Cattle and Grain, and breeds every where store of Conies,
<PB REF="28">
Hares, Partridges and Phesants, pleasant for meadows, pasturage, and Parks; so that nothing is want|ing
that may suffice man. The middle yields plenty of pasture; and forrage for Sheep; whose
wooll the Clothiers esteem the best; next unto that of <HI>Leinster</HI> and <HI>Cotteswold.</HI> If you cast your eyes
towards the North, it is all over garnished with Meadows, Pastures, and Woods: If towards the
South side, it lieth (in a manner) wholly bedecked with Corn fields enclosed, where at each end
the Sea doth so incroach it self, that it maketh almost two Islands besides, namely, <HI>Freshwater Isle,</HI>
which looketh to the West, and <HI>Binbridge Isle,</HI> answering it to the East.</P>
<P>(5) The Commodities of the whole chiefly consist of Cattle, Sea fowl, Fish, and Corn, whereof
it hath sufficient: Woods are not here very plentiful; for that it is only stored with one little Forrest;
yet the Countrey of <HI>Hant-shire</HI> for vicinity of Site, is a friendly neighhour in that behalf; so (as
it were being tyed together in affinity) they are always ready and propense to add to each others
wants and defects by a mutual supply.</P>
<P>(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Island were the <HI>Belgae,</HI> spoken of in the several Provinces
of <HI>Sommerset-shire, Wilt-shire,</HI> and <HI>Hant-shire.</HI> Such as did then possess it were called <HI>Lords of the Isle of
Wight,</HI> till it fell into the Kings hands, by <HI>Roger</HI> (Son to <HI>William Fits Osburne,</HI> slain in the war of
<HI>Flanders</HI>) that was driven into exile. And <HI>Henry</HI> the first King of <HI>England</HI> gave it unto <HI>Richard Rid|vers,</HI>
with the Fee or Inheritance of the Town of <HI>Christs-Church,</HI> where (as in all other places) he
built certain Fortresses.</P>
<P>(7) The Principal Market-Town in the Isle of <HI>Newport,</HI> called in times past <HI>Medena;</HI> and <HI>No|vus
Burgus de Meden;</HI> that is, <HI>The new Burgh of Meden,</HI> whereof the whole Countrey is divided into
East-<HI>Meden,</HI> and West-<HI>Meden.</HI> A Town well seated, and much frequented; unto whose Burgesses
his Majesty hath lately granted the choice of a Major, who with his brethren do govern accord|ingly.
It is populous with Inhabitants, having an entrance into the Isle from the Haven, and a
<PB REF="29">
Passage for Vessels of small burden unto the Key. Not far from it, is the Castle <HI>Caresbrook,</HI> whose
founder is said to have been <HI>Whitgar</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and from him called <HI>VVhite-Garesburgh:</HI> but now
made shorter for easier pronunciation; the graduation whereof for Latitude is in the degree 50,
36 minutes: and her Longitude in 19, 4 minutes, where formerly hath stood a Priory, and at
<HI>Quarre</HI> a Nunnery; a necessary neighbour to those Penitentiaries. And yet in their merry mood
the Inhabitants of this Island do boast, that they were happier then their neighbour Countries
for that they never had Monk that ever wore hood, Lawyer that cavelled, nor Foxes that were

<P>(8) It is reported, that in the year of mans Salvation, 1176. and twenty three of King <HI>Henry</HI>
the second, that in this Island it rained a showre of bloud, which continued for the space of 2 hours
together, to the great wonder and amazement of the people that beheld it with fear.</P>
<P>(9) This Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> is fortified both by Art and Nature, for besides the strength of Artificial
Forts and Block houses (wherewith it is well furnished) it wants not the Assistants of natural
Fences, as being enriched with a continual ridge and range of craggy Cliffs and Rocks, and
Banks very dangerous for Saylers, as the <HI>Needles,</HI> so called by reason of their sharpness: The
<HI>Shingl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Mixon, Brambles,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>(10) <HI>Vespasian</HI> was the first that brought it to the subjection of the <HI>Romans,</HI> whilest he served
as a private person under <HI>Claudius Caesar.</HI> And <HI>Cerdic</HI> was the first <HI>English Saxon</HI> that subdued it, who
granting it unto <HI>Scuffe</HI> and <HI>VVhitgar,</HI> they joyntly together slew (almost) all the <HI>British</HI> Inhabi|tants
(being but few of them, there remaining) in the Town aforesaid, called of his name <HI>VVhit|garesburgh.
VVolpher</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI> reduced this Island afterwards under his obedience, and
at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ime when he became God-father to <HI>Edelwalch</HI> King of the <HI>South Saxons,</HI> and answered fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

<PB REF="29">
<HI>Edelwalch</HI> was slain, and <HI>Arvandus</HI> the petty King of the Island was made away, <HI>Caedwalla</HI> King of the
<HI>West-Saxons</HI> annexed it to his Dominion, and in a tragical and lamentable Massacre put to the sword
(almost) every mothers child of the in-born Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The thing that is best worthy note and observation is this, That Bishop <HI>Wilfrid</HI> was the first that
instructed the Inhabitants of this Island in Christian Religion, and brought them from Idolatrous
Superstition, with the which (unto that time) they were obscurely blinded.</P>
<P>For Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, this Countrey belongeth to the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and for Civil
government to the County of <HI>South-hampton.</HI> It is fortified with the strength of six Castles, traded
with three Market-Towns, and hath 36 Parish-Churches planted in it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>DORCESTER, from her ancient people DUROTRIGES, is most likely to have
received that name: By the <HI>Britains</HI> called DWRGWEIR, lieth bounded upon the
North side with <HI>Sommerset</HI> and <HI>Wilt-shire,</HI> upon the West with <HI>Devon-shire,</HI> and some
part with <HI>Sommerset;</HI> upon the East altogether with <HI>Hamp-shire:</HI> and her South part
is wholly bounded with the <HI>British Seas.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form grows wider from the West, and spreads her self the broadest in the midst,
where it extends to twenty four miles, but in length is no less than forty four: The whole in
Circumference about, is one hundred and fifty miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is good, and of an healthful constitution: the soyl is fat, affording many com|modities,
and the Countrey most pleasant in her situation: for the In-land is watered with many
sweet and fresh running-Springs, which taking passage through the plain Vallies, do lastly in a lo|ving
manner unite themselves together, and of their many branches make many big bodied
streams: neither doth the Sea deny them entrance, but helpeth rather to fill up their Banks, where|by

<P>(4) Antiently it was possest by the <HI>Durotriges,</HI> whom <HI>Ptolomy</HI> placeth along in this Tract, who
being subdued by the <HI>Romans</HI> yielded them room, and unwilling subjection. After them the <HI>Sax|ons</HI>
set foot in these parts, whereof <HI>Portland</HI> seemeth from that Port to take name, who in this place
arrived in <HI>Anno</HI> 703. and did sorely infect and annoy all the South Tract. And at <HI>Bindon</HI> before him

vanquished the <HI>Britains.</HI> Neither were the <HI>Saxons</HI> so surely herein seated, but that the <HI>Danes</HI> sought
to defeat them thereof: for twice these bold <HI>Rovers</HI> landed at <HI>Chartmouth,</HI> the first was in <HI>Anno</HI> 831.
and reign of King <HI>Egbert;</HI> and the other eight years after, when <HI>Elthelwolfe</HI> was King: in both

small power obtained a great victory, causing their King <HI>Canute</HI> with discourage to retire.</P>
<P>(5) Commodities arising in this County are chiefly <HI>Wools</HI> and <HI>Woods</HI> in her North, where the
<HI>Vorrests</HI> are stored with the one, and the pleasant green Hills with the other. The other part is o|ver-spread
both with <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Grass,</HI> and the Sea yieldeth the <HI>Isidis Plocamos,</HI> a Shrub growing
not unlike the <HI>Corral</HI> without any leafe; besides her other gifts, turning all to great gain: which
the more is made manifect by the many Market-Towns in this Shire, whereof <HI>Dorchester</HI> is the
chief, in <HI>Antonius</HI> his <HI>Itinerarum</HI> termed <HI>Durnovaria,</HI> situated upon the South side of <HI>Frome,</HI> and
the <HI>Roman Causey</HI> called <HI>Fosse-way,</HI> wherein some of their <HI>Legions</HI> kept, as by the <HI>Rampiers</HI> and <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI>
there daily digged up is probably conjectured; at which time it seemeth the City was walled, where|of
some part yet standeth, especially upon the West and South sides, and the Tract and Trench most
apparent in a Quadrant-wise almost meeteth the River, containing in circuit one thousand and seven
hundred paces, but were cast down by the <HI>Daues,</HI> whose trampling feet destroyed all things
wheresover they came, and hands here razed the Trenches <HI>Maudbury</HI> and <HI>Poundbury,</HI> the seals of
their <HI>Siege,</HI> and signs of times misery. About three hundred paces South-ward from hence, stand|eth
an old Fortification of Earth, trenched about and mounted above the ordinary Plain, thirty
paces containing some five Acres of ground; wherein (at my there-being) plenty of <HI>Corn</HI> grew.
This the Inhabitants call <HI>The Maiden Castle,</HI> having entrance thereunto only upon the East and
<PB REF="31">
West. This is thought to have been a Summer-Camp or Station of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Romans,</HI> when their <HI>Garisons</HI>
kept the Frontiers of this Province.</P>
<P>The government of this City is yearly committed to two <HI>Bayliffs,</HI> elected out of eight <HI>Magistrates</HI> or <HI>Aldermen,</HI> a <HI>Recorder, Town-Clerk,</HI> and two <HI>Sergeants</HI> attending them: whence the North-Pole
is elevated 50 degrees, 48 minutes in Latitude, and for Longitude is removed from the first West|point
unto the Meridian of eighteen degrees.</P>
<P>(6) Other places also are memorable through the actions therein happening, or antiquities
there yet remaining: such is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">adbury,</HI> now nothing but a <HI>Trench</HI> and decayed <HI>Castle,</HI> hardly seen,
though sometimes it was the Court of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> Kings. Such also is <HI>Cerne,</HI> where <HI>Augustine</HI> the
<HI>English</HI> Apostle brake down the <HI>Altars</HI> and <HI>Idols</HI> of the <HI>Saxons God</HI> HELL, whom they devoutly
honoured as the only conserver of their health. <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> also, wherein one <HI>Aquila</HI> (whether
a <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Eagle</HI> I know not) by our <HI>Historians</HI> report, is said to have prophesied the future times of
this our Empire, and that after the reigns of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> it should again return unto
the government of the <HI>British</HI> Kings. But with such vain predictions, our Nation is more than once
taxed by <HI>Philip Comineus</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Writer. In this City <HI>Edward</HI> the son of great <HI>Edgar,</HI> and
one and thirtieth Monarch of the <HI>English-men,</HI> was interred, being murdered at <HI>Corfe,</HI> a Castle seated
in the Isle of <HI>Purbeck,</HI> by his Step mother <HI>Aelfrith,</HI> to make way for her Son to enjoy his Crown: in
repentance whereof, and to pacifie Heaven for his bloud, she built the <HI>Monasteries</HI> of <HI>Ambresbury</HI> and
<HI>Whorwell,</HI> in the County of <HI>Wilt-shire</HI> and <HI>South-hampton.</HI> In the former of which with great peni|tency
she spent the rest of her life.</P>
<P>(7) As upon the like occasion the Monastery of <HI>Middleton</HI> was laid in this Shire by King <HI>E|thelstan</HI>
to appease the <HI>Ghost</HI> of <HI>Edwin</HI> his innocent brother, and to expiate the sin of his own
soul for the bloud of that just Prince, whom most unjustly he caused to die: and with the like de|votion,
<PB REF="32">
thought not to satisfie for the like bloudy sins, did Queen <HI>Cuthburga</HI> sue a Divorce from
her seco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d husband the <HI>Northumberlands</HI> King, and at <HI>Winburne</HI> built her a <HI>Nunnery,</HI> whereof her
self became <HI>Abbesse,</HI> where afterward was raised a most stately <HI>Minster,</HI> which added not only more
glory to the place, but withall enlarged the name, and made it to be called <HI>Winburn-Minster,</HI> where
King <HI>Etheldred,</HI> a most vertuous Prince, after much disquietness had with the <HI>Danes,</HI> in peace here
resteth, with his Tombe and ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ription, as in his History (Christ assisting) shall be further seen.
Neither among these may I omit <HI>Sherburne,</HI> which in the year of grace, 704. was made a Bishops
See, in whose Cathedral Church was interred the bodies of <HI>Ethelbald</HI> and <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> brethren, both
of them Monarchs of the <HI>English men.</HI></P>
<P>(8) Seven more besides these were set apart from worldly impolyments, consecrated onely to
God and his service in this Service; which were <HI>Camestern, Cranburn, Abbottesbury Bindon, Sturminster,
Tarrant</HI> and <HI>Warham.</HI> These with the others came to their full period under the hand of King <HI>Henry</HI>
the Eighth, which lay with such weight upon their fair buildings, that he crushed the juyce there|of
into his own Coffers.</P>
<P>(9) Castles for defence in repair and decayed, were at <HI>Sherburne, Dorchester, Branksey, Portland,
Corfe, Newton, Woodford,</HI> and <HI>Wareham;</HI> so that with these and others the County hath been strength|ned,
with twelve Religious Houses their poor relieved, with eighteen Market-Towns at this day
is traded, and principally into five divisions parted, subdivided into thirty four Hundreds, and them

<P>(2) The West of this County is bounded altogether by the River <HI>Tamer:</HI> the East is

which with a longing desire of Society search out their passage, till they meet and conjoyn in the

from East to West, so that scarcely had it gotten breath before <HI>VVilliam</HI> the bastard of <HI>Normandy</HI> be|sieged
it, against whom the Citizens with great manhood served, till a part of the wall fell down
of it self, and that by the hand of Gods providence, saith mine Author: Since when it hath been
<PB REF="34">three times besieged, and with valiant resistance ever defended. The first was by <HI>Hugh Courtney,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> in the civil broiles betwixt <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>York:</HI> Then by <HI>Perkin VVarbeck,</HI> that
counterfeited <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York:</HI> And lastly, by the <HI>Cornish</HI> Rebels, wherein although the Citizens
were grievously pinched with scarcity, yet continued they their faithful allegiance unto King <HI>Edward</HI>
the sixth; and at this day flourisheth in tranquility and wealth, being governed by a Major, twenty
four Brethren, with a Recorder, Town-Clerk, and other Officers their Attendants. This Cities
graduation is set in the degree of Latitude from the North Pole 50 and 45 scruples: And for Longitude
from the West, to the degree 16, and 25 scruples. Neither is <HI>Ioseph</HI> that excellent Poet, whose
birth was in this City, the least of her Ornaments, whose Writings bear so great credit, that they
were divulged in the <HI>German</HI> Language under the name of <HI>Cornelius Nepos.</HI></P>
<P>The like credit got <HI>Crediton</HI> in her birth child <HI>VVinifred</HI> the Apostle of the <HI>Hassians, Thuringers,</HI> and
<HI>Frisians</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> which were converted by him unto Gospel and knowledge of Christ.</P>
<P>(7) Places memorable in this County remaining for signs of Battles, or other antiquities, are
these: Upon <HI>Exmore</HI> certain Monuments of Antick-work are erected, which are stones pitched in
order, some Triangle-wise, and some in round compass: These no doubt were trophies of Victories
there obtained, either by the <HI>Romans, Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Danes,</HI> and with <HI>Danish</HI> Letters one of them is in|scribed,
giving direction to such as should travel that way. <HI>Hublestowe</HI> likewise near unto the
mouth of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">awe,</HI> was the burial place of <HI>Huba</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> who with his Brother <HI>Hungar,</HI> had harried
the <HI>English</HI> in divers parts of the Land: But lastly, was there encountred with, and slain by this Shires
Inhabitants, and under a heap of copped stones interred, and the Banner <HI>Reasen</HI> there and then taken,
that had so often been spread in the <HI>Danes</HI> quarrel, and wherein they reposed no small confidence for
success.</P>
<P><PB REF="35">(8) A double dignity remaineth in this County, where Princes of State have born the Ti|tles
both of <HI>Devon-shire</HI> and <HI>Excester:</HI> of which City, there have been entituled Dukes, the last of
whom, namely, <HI>Henry Holland,</HI> Grand-child to <HI>Iohn Holland,</HI> half-brother to King <HI>Richard</HI> the
Second; siding with <HI>Lancaster</HI> against <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, whose Sister was his wife, was driven to such
misery, as <HI>Philip Comineus</HI> repotteth, that he was seen all torn and bare-footed to beg his living in
the <HI>Low Countries:</HI> And lastly, his body was cast upon the shore of <HI>Kent</HI> (as if he had perished by
ship-wrack) so certain is <HI>Fortune</HI> in her endowments, and the state of man, notwithstanding his
great birth.</P>
<P>(9) Religious Houses in this Shire built in devotion, and for Idolatry pulled down, were at
<HI>Excester, Torhay, Tanton, Tavestokes, Kirton, Hartland, Axminster,</HI> and <HI>Berstuble.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>CORNWALL (as <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Winchester affirmeth</HI>) is so named partly from the form, and
partly from her people: for shooting it self into the Sea like an <HI>Horn</HI> (which the <HI>Britains</HI>
call <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rne</HI>) and inhabited by them whom the <HI>Saxons</HI> named <HI>Wallia;</HI> of these two com|pounded
words it became <HI>Cornwallia.</HI> Not to trouble the Reader with the Fable of
<HI>Corinnus</HI> cousin to King <HI>Brute,</HI> who in free gift received this County in reward of his
prowess, for wrestling with the Giant <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> and breaking his neck from the <HI>Cliffe</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> as he
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> hath fabuled.</P>
<P>(2) Touching the temperature of this County, the Air thereof is cleansed as with <HI>Bellowes,</HI> by
the <HI>Billowes</HI> that ever work from off her environing Seas, where thorow it becometh pure and sub|tile,
and is made thereby very healthful, but withall so piercing and sharp, that it is apter to pre|serve
than to recover health. The Spring is not so early as in more Eastern parts; yet the Summer
with a temperate heat recompenseth his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">low fostering of the fruits with their most kindly ripening.
The Autumne bringeth a somewhat late Harvest: and the Winter, by reason of the Seas warm
breath, maketh the cold milder than else-where. Notwithstanding that Countrey is much subject to
stormy b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">asts, whose violence hath freedome from the open waves, to beat upon the dwellers at
Land, leaving many times their houses uncovered.</P>
<P>(3) The Soyl for the most part is lifted up into many hills, parted asunder with narrow and
short val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">es, and a shallow earth doth cover their outside, which by a <HI>Sea weed</HI> called <HI>Orewood,</HI> and
a certain kind of fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">sul <HI>Sea-sand,</HI> they make so rank and batten, as is uncredible. But more are
<PB REF="36">
the riches that out of those hills are gotten from the <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Copper</HI> and <HI>Tinn;</HI> which Countrey was
the first, and continueth the best stored in that merchandize, of any in the world. <HI>Timaeus</HI> the <HI>Histo|rian</HI>
in <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth, that the <HI>Britains fetched their Tinn in Wicker boats, stitched about with Leather.</HI>
And <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> of <HI>Augustus Caesars</HI> time writeth, that the <HI>Britains in this part digged Tin out of
stony ground, which by Merchants was carried into Gallia, and thence to Narborne, as it were to a Mart.</HI>
Which howsoever the <HI>English Saxons</HI> neglected, yet the <HI>Normans</HI> made great benefit thereof, especi|ally
<HI>Richard</HI> brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who was Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and by those <HI>Tinn-works</HI>
became exceedingly rich: for the incursions of the <HI>Moores</HI> having stopped up the <HI>Tinn|-Mines</HI> in
<HI>Spain,</HI> and them in <HI>Germany</HI> not discovered before the year of Christ 1240. these in <HI>Cornwall</HI> supply|ed
the want in all parts of the world. This Earl made certain <HI>Tinn-Laws</HI> which with liberties and
priviledges were confirmed by Earl <HI>Edmund</HI> his son. And in the days of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third,
the Common-weale of <HI>Tinn-works</HI> from one body was divided into four, and a <HI>Lord Warden</HI> of the
<HI>Stanniers</HI> appointed their Iudge.</P>
<P>(4) The Borders of this Shire on all parts but the East, is bound in with the Sea: and had <HI>Tamer</HI>
drawn his course but four miles further to the North, betwixt this <HI>County</HI> and <HI>Devonshire,</HI> it might
have been rather accounted an <HI>Island,</HI> than stood with the <HI>Mayne.</HI> Her length is from <HI>Launston</HI> to the
<HI>Lands-end,</HI> containing by measure 60 miles: and the broadest part stretching along by the <HI>Tamer,</HI> is
fully forty, lessening thence still lesser like a horn.</P>
<P>(5) The Antient inhabitants known to the <HI>Romans,</HI> were the <HI>Danmonii,</HI> that spread themselves
further into <HI>Devon-shire</HI> also, by the report of <HI>Diodorus Sicul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">, a most courteous and civil people:</HI> and by
<HI>Michael</HI> their Poet extolled for <HI>valour and strength of limbs:</HI> nor therein doth he take the liberty that
Poets are allowed, to add to the subject whreof they write, but truly repotteth what we see by
them performed, who in activity surmount many other people.</P>
<P><PB REF="37">When the <HI>Heathen Saxons</HI> had seated themselves in the best of this Land, and forced the <HI>Christian

was called <HI>Candorus.</HI></P>
<P>(6) But <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Bastard</HI> created <HI>Robert</HI> (his half-brother by <HI>Herlotta</HI> their mother) the first
Earl of the <HI>Normans</HI> race: and <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> the ninth from him, was by his Father King
<HI>Edward</HI> the third invested the first Duke of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> which Title ever since hath continued in the
<HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P>(7) The Commodities of this Shire, ministred both by <HI>Sea</HI> and <HI>Soile,</HI> are many and and great; for
besides the abundance of Fish, that do suffice the Inhabitants, the <HI>Pilchard</HI> is taken, who in great
shuls swarm about the Coast, whence being transported to <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> yield a yearly
revenue of gain unto <HI>Cornwall:</HI> wherein also <HI>Copper</HI> and <HI>Tinn</HI> so plentifully grow in the utmost
part of this <HI>Promontory,</HI> that at a low water the veins thereof lie bare, and are seen: and what gain
that commodity begets, is vulgarly known. Neither are these <HI>Rocks</HI> destitute of <HI>Gold</HI> nor <HI>Silver,</HI>
yea and <HI>Diamonds</HI> shaped and pointed Angle wise, and smoothed by <HI>Nature</HI> her self, whereof some
are as big as <HI>Wallnuts,</HI> inferiour to the <HI>Orient</HI> only in blackness and hardness.</P>
<P>Many are the <HI>Ports, Bayes,</HI> and <HI>Havens</HI> that open into this Shire, both safe for arrivage, and com|modious
transport; whereof <HI>Falmouth</HI> is so copious, that an hundred Ships may therein ride at An|chor
apart by themselves, so that from the tops of their highest Masts, they shall not see each other,
and lie most safely under the Winds.</P>
<P><PB REF="37">(8) This County is fruitful in <HI>Corn, Cattle, Sea-fish,</HI> and <HI>Fowl:</HI> all which, with other provision
for pleasures and life, are traded thorow twenty two Market-Towns in this Shire, whereof <HI>Lauston</HI>
and <HI>Bodman</HI> are the best; from which last, being the middle of the Shire, the Pole is elevated to the
degree of Latitude 50, 35 minutes, and for Longitude from the first West-Point 15, 13 minutes, as

<P>(9) Memorable matters both for antiquity and strangeness of sight, are these; At <HI>Boskenna</HI>
upon the South west of her <HI>Promontory,</HI> is a trophy erected, which are eighteen Stones placed round
in compass, and pitched twelve foot each from others, with another far bigger in the very center:
These do shew some victory there attained, either by the <HI>Roman,</HI> or else King <HI>Athelstan.</HI> At the
foot of the Rock near unto S. <HI>Michaels M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">nt,</HI> in the memory of our Fathers, were digged up <HI>Spear|heads,
Axes,</HI> and <HI>Swords</HI> of <HI>Brass,</HI> wrapped in linen, the weapons that the <HI>Cimbrians</HI> and ancient
<HI>Britains</HI> anciently used.</P>
<P>At <HI>Camelford</HI> likewise pieces of <HI>Armours</HI> both for horse and man, are many times found in digging
of the ground, imputed to the signs of that fight wherein <HI>Mordred</HI> was slain, and wherein great
<HI>Arthur</HI> received his deaths wound. And at <HI>Castle Dennys</HI> are the Trenches wherein the <HI>Danes</HI> lodged
when they first minded to subdue the Land. In the Parish S. <HI>Clare,</HI> two stones are pitched, one of
them inscribed with a strange Character, and the other called <HI>The other half stone.</HI> The <HI>Hurlers</HI> also,
fabuled to be men metamorphosed into stones; but in truth shew a note of some victory, or else

to <HI>Pensans,</HI> and unto <HI>Mounts bay,</HI> a far more strange Rock standeth, namely, <HI>Main-Amber,</HI> which

lyeth mounted upon others of meaner size, with so equal a counterpoize, that a man may move it
with the push of his finger, but no strength remove it out of its place.</P>

for account, were <HI>Launston,</HI> S. <HI>Neotes,</HI> S <HI>Buriens,</HI> S. <HI>Michaels Mount,</HI> and S. <HI>Germains,</HI> a Bishops

<HEAD>SOMMERSET-SHIRE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>SOMMERSET-SHIRE is both a rich and spacious Countrey, having the <HI>Sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sea</HI>
beating upon it on the North side, the South part bordering upon <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Dorset-shires,</HI>
the West confined with <HI>Devon shire,</HI> and the East and North-East upon <HI>Wilt shire,</HI> and
<HI>Gloucester shire.</HI> It took the name of <HI>Sommerron</HI> (sometime the chief Town of this Shire)
whence in the Ancient Historian <HI>Asserius,</HI> this County is called <HI>Sommertunensis,</HI> that is,
<HI>Sommertun-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is large, bearing it self still wider as it slretcheth into the middle part thereof,
and contains in length from <HI>Brackley</HI> near unto <HI>Frome Selwood</HI> Eastward, to <HI>Oure</HI> in the West, Miles 55.
In breadth from <HI>Parshut Point</HI> in the North, to <HI>Chard</HI> Southward, is somewhat above forty miles.
The whole ciacumference is about 204 miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is milde and pleasing, and for the most part subject to such temperate dispositions as
the Sommer-season affordeth, whence some have erroniously conceited, that the Region borrowed
her name from the nature of her Clime: yet how delightful soever it is in the time of Summer,
with change of the season it may well change her pleasing name, and borrow some Winterly deno|mination;
so full of wet, so miry and moorish it is; in so much as the Inhabitants can hardly travel
to and fro without their encumbrance.</P>
<P>(4) Howbeit they pass over this with all patience, knowing their ensuing seasonable profits
far to exceed any present detriments and displeasures: for as it is fowl, so it is fruitful, which
makes them comfort themselves with this Proverb, that <HI>What is worst for the Rider, is best for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bider:</HI> the Soyl and Glebe thereof being very fertile, and every side garnished with Pastures and
<PB REF="39">
delightful Meadows, and beautified with Mannor houses both many and fair; and (in a word)
hath every thing in it to content the purse, the heart, the eye, at home: and sufficient ports to give
entertainment to commodities from abroad.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants that possessed this Province were the <HI>Belgae,</HI> who spread themselves
far and wide, as well here as in <HI>Wilt-shire,</HI> and the inner parts of <HI>Hant-shire,</HI> who being branched
from the <HI>Germans,</HI> conferred the names of those places from whence they came, upon these their seats
where they resided.</P>
<P>(6) The general profits of this province are Corn and Cattle, wherewith it is so plentifully sto|red,
as it may challenge any neighbouring County for the quantity to make shew of Cattle so fat, or
Grain so rich. Some places are peculiarly enriched by Lead-mines, as <HI>Mindiphils,</HI> (perchance so
called of the deep Mines) by <HI>Leiland</HI> aptly termed <HI>Minerarii, Mineral-hills,</HI> which yield plenty of
Lead, the most Merchantable Commodity that is in <HI>England,</HI> and vented into all parts of the world.
Some are beautified with Diamonds, as S, <HI>Vincent Rock,</HI> whereof there is great plenty, and so bright
of colour, as they might equalize <HI>Indian</HI> Diamonds, if they had their hardness: yet being so many,
and so common, they are less sought after or commended.</P>
<P>(7) This Countrey is famoused by three Cities, <HI>Bath, Wells,</HI> and <HI>Bristow.</HI> The first takes name
of the hot Bathes, which <HI>Antonine</HI> called <HI>Aquae Solis, The waters of the Sun; Stephanus, Badiza:</HI> we
at this day <HI>Bathe,</HI> and the Latinists <HI>Bathonta:</HI> a place of continual concourse for persons of all de|grees,
and almost of all diseases, (weence it was sometimes called <HI>Akemancester</HI>) who by divine pro|vidence
do very often find relief there, the Springs thereof by reason of their Mineral and sul|phurous
passage, being of such exceeding power and medicinable heat, as that they cure and con|quer
the rebellious stubbornness of corrupt humours, in repect of which admirable vertues, some
have fabled, that they were first conveyed by Magick Art. To testifie the antiquity of this place,
<PB REF="40">
many images and <HI>Roman</HI> Inscriptions are found in the walls, which can now be hardly read, they
are so worn and eaten into by age. <HI>Wells</HI> (as <HI>Leiland</HI> reporteth) was sometimes called <HI>Theoderodunum,</HI>
but from whence it had that denomination he makes no mention, the name it now beareth is taken
(as some think) from the River there, which King <HI>Kinewulph</HI> in his Charter <HI>Anno</HI> 766 calleth
<HI>Wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> or (as others) from the <HI>Wells</HI> or <HI>Springs</HI> which there break forth, and whereupon that See
(under whose Iurisdiction is also the City of <HI>Bath</HI>) hath been anciently called <HI>Fontanensis Eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI>
the <HI>Fountain Church:</HI> where the <HI>Cathedral</HI> built by King <HI>Inas</HI> to the memory of S <HI>Andrew,</HI> is very
beautiful and richly endowed. The City is likewise well replenished both with Inhabitants and
seemly buildings. Whose government is managed by a Mayor yearly elected, a Recorder, and
seven Masters, having the Assistancs of sixteen Burgesses, a Town-Clerk, and Two Sergeants at
Mace. Whose Latitude is 51, 20 minutes, and Longitude 17, 31 minutes. <HI>Bristow</HI> is not so anci|ent,
as it is fair and well seated: The beauty of it being such, as for the bigness thereof, it scarce
gives place to any City of <HI>England,</HI> and doth worthily deserve the <HI>Saxons</HI> name <HI>Bright-stad:</HI> whose
pleasantness is the more, by reason that the River <HI>Avon</HI> scowres through the midst of it, which to|gether
with the benefit of <HI>Sewers</HI> under all the streets clears the City of all noysome filth and un|cleanness. It is not wholly seated in this County of <HI>Sommerset,</HI> but one part thereof in <HI>Gloucester|shire;</HI>
but because it is an entire County of it self, it denies subjection unto either, having for its
own government both a Bishop, with a well furnished Colledge, and a Mayor, with a competent
assistance of Aldermen, and other Officers for civil affairs.</P>
<P>(8) This Province hath been the Theater of many Tragical events and bloudy battels: the
<HI>Danes</HI> did grievously afflict <HI>Porlock</HI> by cruel Piracies, in the year eight hundred eighty six. Yet
neer unto <HI>Pen</HI> a little Village neigbouring upon <HI>North Cadbury, Edmund,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Iron-side,</HI> gave
them a notable foyle, as he was pursuing <HI>Canutus</HI> from place, to place, for usurping the <HI>Crown</HI> of
<PB REF="40">
<HI>England.</HI> And <HI>Keniwach (a West-Saxon)</HI> in the same place had such a day against the <HI>Britains,</HI> that
they ever after stood in awe of the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> prowess. <HI>Marianus</HI> relateth that not far from
<HI>Bridge-water,</HI> as the <HI>Danes</HI> were stragling abroad, <HI>Ealstane</HI> Bishop of <HI>Sherbourne</HI> did so soyl their
Forces in the year 845, as their minds were much discomfited, and their powers utterly disabled.
<HI>Ninius</HI> also writeth that King <HI>Arthur</HI> did so defeat the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> in a battel at <HI>Cadbury,</HI> that it de|served
to be made perpetuously memorable. Neither is <HI>Mons Badonicus</HI> (now <HI>Banesdown</HI>) less fa|mous
for <HI>Arthurs</HI> victories. And King <HI>Elfred</HI> in another battel not far from hence gave the <HI>Danes</HI> such
an overthrow, as he forced them to submission, and induced <HI>Godrus</HI> their King to become a Chri|stian,
himself being Godfather to him at the Font. So happy is this <HI>Region,</HI> and so beholding to
Nature and Art for her strengths and fortifications, as she hath a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ways been able to defend her self,
and offend her enemies.</P>
<P>(9) Neither hath it been less honoured with beauteous houses consecrated to Religion: such
was that of <HI>Black Ohanons</HI> at <HI>Barelinch</HI> in the first limit of his Shire Westward: and King <HI>Athelsta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
built a Monastery in an Island called <HI>Muchelney</HI> (that is to say) the <HI>great Island,</HI> which is between
the Rivers <HI>Iuel</HI> and <HI>Pedred,</HI> running together, where the defaced wall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> and runs thereof are yet to
be seen. King <HI>Henry</HI> the third also erected a Nunnery at <HI>Witham,</HI> which was afterwards the first house
of the <HI>Carthusians</HI> Monks in <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Hinton</HI> not far off was the second. But above all other fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
antiquity, glory, and beauty was the Abby of <HI>Glostenbury,</HI> whose beginning is fetcht even from <HI>Io|seph</HI>
of <HI>Arimathea,</HI> which <HI>Davi</HI> Bishop of S. <HI>Davids</HI> repaired, being fallen to ruine, and King <HI>Inas</HI>
lastly builded a fair and stately Church in this Monastery, though it be now made even with the
ground, the ruins only shewing how great and magnificent a Seat it hath anciently been; which se|veral
houses were thus beautified by bounteous Princes, for religious purposes, and to retire the
mind from worldly services, though blinded times and guides diverted them to superstitious and lewd
abuses.</P>
<P><PB REF="41">(10) Other memorable places are these: <HI>Camalet</HI> a very steep hill hard to be ascended, which ap|pears
to have been a work of the <HI>Romans</HI> by divers Coins dig'd up there, on the top whereof are
seen the lineaments of a large and ancient Castle, which the Inhabitants report to have been the Pa|lace
of King <HI>Arthur. Ilchester,</HI> which at the coming of the <HI>Normans</HI> was so populous, that it had in it
an hundred and seven Burgesses, and it appears to be of great antiquity, by the <HI>Roman Caesars</HI>
Coyns, oftentimes found there. The Church-yard of <HI>Avalenia</HI> or <HI>Glastonbury,</HI> where King <HI>Arthurs</HI>
Sepulchre was searcht for by the command of King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, which was found under a
stone, with an Inscription upon it faftned, almost nine foot in the ground. Also <HI>Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">stere,</HI> where
(as is reported) a great Lady obtained of her husband so much Pasture ground in a Common by the
Town side, for the good and benefit of the Inhabitants, as she was able in a whole day to go about
bare-foot.</P>
<P>This County is divided into 42 Hundreds, for the disposing of business needful for the State
thereof, wherein are placed 33 Market-Towns, fit for buying and selling, and other affairs of
Commerce. It is fortified with four Castles, and planted with 385 Parishes, for concourse of Divine
Service.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>WILT-SHIRE, is enclosed upon the North with <HI>Gloucester-Shire,</HI> upon the East is
bounded with <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rk-shire,</HI> upon the South with <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Hamp-shire,</HI> and upon the
West is confronted against partly by <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and the rest by <HI>Somerset-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is both long and broad; for from <HI>Inglesham</HI> upon <HI>Thamisis</HI> in
the North, to <HI>Burgat Damarum</HI> in the South, are thirty miles; the broadest part
is from <HI>Buttermer</HI> Eastward, to the <HI>Shire-stones</HI> in the West, being tweuty nine; the whole in Cir|cumference,
is one hundred thirty nine miles.</P>
<P>(3) For Air, it is feated in a temperate Climate, both sweet, pleasant, and wholesome; and for
soil (saith <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Sarisbury) is exceeding fortile and plentiful, yea, and that with variety.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Northern part which they call <HI>North-Wilt shire,</HI> riseth up into delectable hills, attired
with large Woods, and watered with clear Rivers, whereof <HI>Isis</HI> is one, which soon becometh the
most famous in the Land. The South part is more even, yielding abundantly Grass and Corn;
and is made the more fruitful by the Rivers <HI>Wily, Adder,</HI> and <HI>Avon.</HI> The midst of this County is most
plain, and thereby is known and commonly called <HI>Salesbnry Plaines;</HI> and lie so level indeed, that
it doth limit the <HI>Horizon;</HI> for hardly can a man see from the one side to the other. These <HI>Plaines</HI>
grase an infinite number of sheep, whose fleeces and flesh bring in a yearly revenue to their
owners.</P>
<P>(5) Anciently this County was possessed by the <HI>Belgae,</HI> who are seated by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> in <HI>Hamp-shire,
Sommerset shire,</HI> and in this Tract; and they (as it seemeth by <HI>Caesar</HI>) were of the <HI>Belgae</HI> in <HI>Gaul.</HI> These
<PB REF="42">
(as some hold) were subdued by <HI>Vespatian,</HI> Lieutenant of the second Legion under <HI>Claudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> when
the foundation of his future greatness was in these parts first laid by his many Victories over the
<HI>Britains.</HI> And herein surely the <HI>Romans</HI> seated; for besides <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">esbury Trench,</HI> by Tradition held to be
his, in many other Forts in this Shire the Tract of their Footing hath been left, and the stamped
Coins of their Emperours found, and apparent testimony of their abode.</P>
<P>(6) After them the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> made it a part of their Kingdom, whose border was <HI>Avon,</HI> as
witnesseth <HI>Athelward</HI> though the <HI>Marcians</HI> many times encroched upon them, whereby many great
Battles, as <HI>Malmesbury</HI> tells us, betwixt them were fought, when in the young years of their <HI>Heptar|chie</HI>
each sought to enlarge his, by the lessoning of the next: but grown unto more ripeness, they
assigned their limits by a great and long ditch crossing thorow the midst of these <HI>Plaines,</HI> which for
the wonder thereof is supposed by the vulgar to be the work of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and is called of all,
<HI>Wansdike,</HI> undoubtedly of <HI>Wooden,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> Ancester and great reputed God, where a little Village
yet standeth, and retaineth to name <HI>Woodens-burg.</HI> At this place, in <HI>Anno 590, Cea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lin</HI> the <HI>West-Saxon,</HI>
received such a foyl of the <HI>Britains</HI> and his Countrey-men, that he was forced to sorfake his
Kingdom, and to end his days in exile, becoming a pitiful spectacle even unto his own enemies.
And in this place <HI>Ina</HI> the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> joyned Battle with <HI>Ceolred</HI> the <HI>Mercian,</HI> whence both of them
departed with equal loss. The like was at <HI>Bradford</HI> by <HI>Kenilwalch</HI> and <HI>Cuthred;</HI> at <HI>Wilton</HI> betwixt
<HI>Egbert</HI> and <HI>Beornwolfe;</HI> at <HI>Edindon</HI> where King <HI>Elfred</HI> was vanquisher of the <HI>Danes;</HI> and at <HI>wilton,</HI>
where the <HI>Danes</HI> won the day against him. With as bloudy success, though not happening by
sword, was the issue of that Synod assembled at <HI>Calne,</HI> a small town in this County, in the year
of Christ Iesus 977, where being hotly debating for the single life, and against the marriages of the
<HI>Clergy,</HI> what wanted by the word to prove their divorce, was supplyed by a Stratagem, and that
very bloody; for suddenly the main timber brake, and down fell the floor with the Nobles and
<PB REF="43">
Prelates, the Gentlemen and Commons, whereby a great number were hurt, and many more slain;
onely <HI>Dunstan</HI> the Prefident, and mouth for the Monks escaped untouched, the Ioist whereon his
Chair stood remaining most firm: which confirmed the sentence of their separations, whom God had
conjoyned, and became the fall and snare of much incontinency in both sexes.</P>
<P>(7) The chiefest City of this Shire is <HI>Salesbury,</HI> removed from a higher, but a far more conveni|ent
place; whose want of Water was not so great in the mother, as is supplied and replenished in
the daughter, every street almost having a River running thorow her middest; and for sumptuous
and delicate buildings is inferiour to none. The Cathedral, a most rich magnificent Church, was be|gun
by <HI>Richard Poors,</HI> Bishop, and with fourty years continuance was raised to her perfect beauty:
wherein are as many windows as there are days in the year, as many cast Pillars of Marble, as
there are hours in the year, and as many gates for entrance as there are Months in the year. Nei|ther
doth this City retain true honour to her self, but imparteth hers, and receiveth honour
from others, who are intituled <HI>Earls</HI> of <HI>Salesbury,</HI> whereof eight Noble Families have been
dignified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ince the <HI>Normans</HI> Conquest. This Cities situation is in degree, of Latitude 51 10 mi|nutes,
and from the first West point observed by <HI>Mercator,</HI> 18 Degrees, and 31 Minutes of
Longitude.</P>
<P>(8) Over this, old <HI>Salesby</HI> sheweth it self, where <HI>Kenrick</HI> over came the <HI>Britains,</HI> and where
<HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nutus</HI> the <HI>Dana</HI> did great damage by fire. This formerly had been the seat of the <HI>Romans:</HI> as
likewise was <HI>Lecham,</HI> as by their Coins digged up is apparent: so were <HI>Brokenbridge</HI> and <HI>Cosham,</HI>
the Courts of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings. But <HI>Fortune</HI> long since hath turned her face from all these, as lately she
did from many ancient and religious foundations planted in this Province, whereof <HI>Malmesbury,</HI>
was the most famous. I will not with <HI>Monmouth</HI> avouch the foundation thereof unto <HI>Malmutius,</HI>
but by true Records from <HI>Maidulph</HI> a Scot, a man of great learning that therein built a <HI>Coll,</HI> and
<PB REF="43">
led an <HI>Hermits</HI> life, whereof <HI>Beda</HI> calleth it the City of <HI>Maidulph,</HI> and we by contraction <HI>Malmes|bury.
Adelme</HI> his Disciple and Successor, built here a fair Monastery, which <HI>Athelstane</HI> the Monarch
richly endowed, and left his body after death there to rest. Neither hath any graced this more than
<HI>William</HI> her Monk, in recording to post<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rities the Chronicles of our Land, concerning both the
Church and Common-weal, wherein himself lived and worte those Histories.</P>
<P>(9) <HI>Ambresbury</HI> for repute did second this, built by <HI>Alfritha</HI> King <HI>Edgar</HI> his wife, to expiate the
sin of murder which she committed upon young <HI>Edward</HI> her son in law, that hers might be King.
In this place Queen <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">anor</HI> widow to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, renounced all Royal pomp, and devo|ted
her self unto God in the habit of a Nun. Other places erected for piety, were at <HI>Salesbury,
Lacock, Stanley, Wilton, Ivichurch, Parnleg, Bradstoks, Briopune,</HI> and <HI>Bromhore.</HI> These graffs grown to
full greatness, were cut down by the Pruiner, least the cankers thereof should infect the whole
body (as by them was alledged) and their Revenues bestowed upon far better uses, both for the
bringing up of youth, and the Maintenance of estate.</P>
<P>(10) With eight strong Castles this County hath been guarded; in nineteen Market-Towns her
commodities are traded; into twenty nine Hundreds for business is divided, and in them are seated
three hundred and four Parish-Churches.</P>

<P>BARK-SHIRE, whether of the <HI>Box woods</HI> there sited, according to the censure of <HI>Asseriu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Menevensis,</HI> or from a naked and bear less <HI>Oak-tree,</HI> whereunto the people usually resorted in
troublesome times, to confer for the State, I determine not: only the County a long time
hath been so called, and bounded with other in manner as followeth: The North part is
parted by <HI>Thamisis</HI> from <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Oxford Shires;</HI> the South near <HI>Kenne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> doth tract
upon <HI>Hamp-shire;</HI> the East is confined with the County of <HI>Surrey;</HI> and the West with <HI>VVilt-shire</HI> and
<HI>Glocester-shire</HI> is held in.</P>
<P>(2) The form of this Shire doth somewhat resemble a <HI>Sandall</HI> for a mans foot, lying long wise
from East to West, in which part she is broadest, the middle most narrow, and then spreading wi|der
like to the heel: though for her rich endowments and stately magnificence, it may be well ac|counted
the heart of the whole.</P>
<P>(3) The length thereof from <HI>Inglesham</HI> in the West, to old <HI>VVindsor</HI> in the East, extendeth unto for|ty
miles; from <HI>Ink-pen</HI> to <HI>VVightham,</HI> the broadest part from South to North, are twenty four; the
whole in Circumference, about one hundred and twenty miles.</P>
<P>(4) The Air is temperate, sweet, and delightful, and prospect for pleasure inferiour to none;
the Soyl is plenteous of Corn, especially in the Vale of <HI>VVhite-horse,</HI> that yieldeth yearly an admira|ble
encrease. In a word, for Corn, and Cattle, Waters, and Woods, of profit and pleasure, it gives
place unto none.</P>
<P>(5) Her ancient inhabitants, by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Caesar,</HI> were the <HI>Attrebatii,</HI> and them of those that
descended from <HI>Gallia,</HI> among whom <HI>Comiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> (conquered by the Dictator) was of good respect,
<PB REF="45">
and could do much with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> who (as <HI>Frontinus</HI> reporteth) used this stratagem, though it
proved nothing at last: he flyed before <HI>Caesar</HI> to recover aid of these <HI>Attrebatians,</HI> light bedded upon
a shelf in the Sea, whereupon hoysting his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ailes as before a fore-wind, gave shew to his pursuer
that they were in swift flight; so that hopeless to hail them, he gave over the chase; yet no sooner
had <HI>Caesar</HI> made over among them, but that some of these people, by the name <HI>Bibrotes,</HI> yielded
him subjection, which proved the ruine of all former liberty. But when the <HI>Romans</HI> had rent their
own Empire, and retired their Legion into a narrower circuit, the <HI>Saxons</HI> set foot where their forces
had been, and made this County a parcel of their Western Kingdom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Danes</HI> then setting their desire upon spoils, from their roaving Pinnaces pierced into these
parts, and at <HI>Redding</HI> fortified themselves betwixt the Rivers <HI>Kennet</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>Thamisis,</HI> whether after their
great overthrow received at <HI>Inglefield</HI> by the hand of King <HI>Ethelwolfe,</HI> they retired for their further
safety.</P>
<P>(6) This Town King <HI>Henry</HI> the first most stately beautified with a rich <HI>Monastery</HI> and strong
<HI>Castle,</HI> where in the Collegiate Chuch of the <HI>Abbey,</HI> himself and Queen (who lay both vailed and
crowned) with the daughter <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress, called the <HI>Lady</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> were interred, as
the private History of the place avoucheth, though others bestow the bodies of these two Queens
elsewhere. The Castle King <HI>Henry</HI> the second razed to the ground, because it was the refuge for the
followers of King <HI>Stephen.</HI> From whence the North pole is raised in Latitude 51 degrees and 40
minutes, and in Longitude from the first West-point observed by <HI>Mercator</HI> 19 degrees and 35
minutes.</P>
<P>(7) A Castle and Town of greater strength and antiquity was <HI>Wallingford,</HI> by <HI>Autonie</HI> and
<HI>Ptolomy</HI> called <HI>Gellena,</HI> the chiefest City of the <HI>Attrebatians,</HI> whose large circuit, and strong fortifi|cations,
shew plainly that it was a place of the <HI>Romans</HI> abode, and since in a conceived safety hath
<PB REF="45">
made many very bold, especially when the sparks of <HI>Englands</HI> civil dissentions were forced to flame
in case of the Crown betwixt <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress and King <HI>Stephen,</HI> whether her self and associates
resorted as their surest defence.</P>
<P>(8) But of far greater magnificence and state is the Castle of <HI>Windsor,</HI> a most Princely Palace
and Mansion of His Majesty. I will not with <HI>Ieffery</HI> affirm it to be built by King <HI>Arthur,</HI> but with
better authority say, it was so thirsted after-by the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> that by a composition with the Abbot
of <HI>Westminster,</HI> whose then it was, he made it to be the Kings possesson, as a place, besides the plea|sures,
very commodious to entertain the King. In this Castle that victorious Prince King <HI>Edward</HI>
the third was born, and herein after he had subdued the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> held he at one and the
same time, as his Prisoners, <HI>Iohn</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Neither was it ever
graced with greater Majesty than by the institution of the most honourable Order of the Garter,
a signal Ornament of Martial Prowesse; the invention thereof some ascribe to be from a Garter
falling from his Queen, or rather from <HI>Ioan</HI> Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> a Lady of an incomperable
beauty, as she danced before him; whereat the by-standers smiling, he gave the impress to check
all evil conceits, and in golden Letters imbellished the Garter with this <HI>French</HI> Posie, HONI SO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
QU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> MALY PENSE. And yet that worthy <HI>Clarenceaux</HI> alledging the Book of the first insti|tution,
finds the invention to be more ancient; as when King <HI>Richard</HI> the first warred against the
<HI>Turks, Saracens, Cypres,</HI> and <HI>Acon,</HI> he girt the legs of certain choise Knights with a tack of leather,
which promised a future glory to the wearers. The most Princely Chappel thereof is graced with the
bodies of those two great Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, whom the whole Kingdom
was too little to contain, the one of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the other of <HI>York,</HI> where the rest now united in one
mould, with a branch of both those Houses, even King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, who there lieth also inter|red,
and rests in the Lord.</P>
<P><PB REF="46">(9) Other places of note in this Shire are <HI>Sinodum</HI> in the North, and <HI>Watham</HI> in the East, both
of them places of the <HI>Romans</HI> residence, as by their moneys there oftentimes found appeareth. Nei|ther
was <HI>Sunning</HI> the least in this Tract, that had been the seat of eight Bishops before the See was
translated thence unto <HI>Shirburne,</HI> or that to <HI>Salisbury. Wantage</HI> also is not wanting of honour, in
bringing to life that learned and most valiant King <HI>Ealfred,</HI> the scourge of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and great <HI>Mo|narch</HI> of the <HI>English.</HI> And <HI>Finchhamstead</HI> for wonder inferiour to none, where (as our Writers do
witness) that in the year, a thousand and hundred, a Well boyled up with streams of bloud, and fif|toen
days together continued that <HI>Spring,</HI> whose waters made red all others where they came, to the
great amazement of the beholders.</P>
<P>(10) The riches and sweet Seats that this County affordeth, made many devout persons to shew
their devotions unto true piety, in erecting places for Gods divine Service, and their exemptions
from all worldly business: such were <HI>Abington, Redding, Bysham, Bromehall, Hendley, Hamme,</HI> and
<HI>Wallingford,</HI> whose <HI>Votaries</HI> abusing the intents of their Founders, overthrew both their own Or|ders
and places of professions; all which were dissolved by <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and given the King to
dispose at his will.</P>
<P>This Shires division is into twenty Hundreds, and hath been strengthened with six strong Castles,
is yet graced with three of His Majesties most Princely Houses, and traded with twelve Market-Towns,
and is replenished with one hundred and forty Parishes.</P>

South, by <HI>Thamesis,</HI> from <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Kent;</HI> and on the East from <HI>Essex,</HI> by the River <HI>Lea.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The length thereof extended from <HI>Stratford</HI> in the East, to <HI>Morehall</HI> upon <HI>Colne</HI> in the West,
is by measure nineteen <HI>English</HI> miles; and from <HI>South-mines</HI> in the North, to his Majesties Mannour
of <HI>Hampton Court</HI> in the South, are little above sixteen miles, the whole Circumference extending to
ninety miles.</P>
<P>(3) In Form it is almost square, for Air passing temperate, for Soyl abundantly fertile, and for
Pasturage and Grain of all kinds, yielding the best, so that the Wheat of this County hath served a
long time for the Manchet to our Princes Table.</P>
<P>(4) It lyeth seated in a vale most wholesome and rich, having some hills also, and them of good
ascent, from whose tops the prospect of the whole is seen like unto <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ar</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> or rather like a
Paradise and Garden of God.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants known to <HI>Caesar,</HI> were the <HI>Trinobants,</HI> whom he nameth to be the
most puisiant in the Land; whose chief City and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eat yieldeth him subjection, made the whole,
with less loss to the <HI>Romans,</HI> to bear the yoke of their own bondage, and to come in under
terms of truce. But when their Forces in these parts were spent, and the Empire shaken by intestine
<PB REF="47">
wars, the <HI>Saxons</HI> setting their eyes upon so fair a soyl made their footing as sure herein; which lastly
with <HI>Hartford</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> was the portion of the <HI>East-Saxons</HI> Kingdom.</P>
<P>(6) Five princely Houses, inheritable to the <HI>English</HI> Crown, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eated in this Shire, which are,
<HI>Enfield, Hanworth, White-hall,</HI> S. <HI>Iames,</HI> and <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> a City rather in shew than the Palace of
a Prince, and for stately Port and gorgeous building, not inferiour to any in <HI>Europe.</HI> At <HI>Thistleworth</HI>
once stood the Palace of King <HI>Richard</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> which the <HI>Londoners</HI> in a

Near unto <HI>Thamesis</HI> entrance into this County, is kept the remembrance of <HI>Caesars</HI> entrance over

<HI>Cedars</HI> among other Trees, being the seat of the <HI>British</HI> Kings, the Chamber of the <HI>English,</HI> the model
of the Land, and the Mart of the World: for thither are brought the silk of <HI>Asia,</HI> the Spices from
<HI>Africa,</HI> the Balms from <HI>Grecia,</HI> and the riches of both the <HI>Indies</HI> East and West, no City standing so
long in fame, nor any for divine and politick government may with her be compared. Her walls
were first set by great <HI>Constantine</HI> the first <HI>Christian Emperour,</HI> at the suit of his Mother Queen <HI>Helen&punc;</HI>
reared with rough Stone and <HI>British</HI> Brick three <HI>English</HI> miles in compass; thorow which are now

at first ranged, and with two gates opened<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the one <HI>Doure-gate,</HI> now <HI>Dowgate,</HI> and the other <HI>Billings|gate,</HI>
a receptacle for Ships. In the midst of this wall was set a mile-mark (as the like was in <HI>Rome</HI>)
from whence, were measured their stations, for carriage or otherwise; the same as yet standeth, and
hath been long known by the name of <HI>London Stone.</HI> Upon the East of this City, the Church of
S. <HI>Peters</HI> is thought to be the Cathedral of <HI>Restitut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> the Christians Bishops See, who lived in the
reign of great <HI>Constantine;</HI> but since St. <HI>Pauls</HI> in the West part, from the Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> assumed
that dignity, whose greatness doth exceed any other at this day, and spires so high that twice it
hath been consumed by lightning from heaven. Besides this Cathedral, God is honoured in one
hundred twenty one Churches more in this City: that is, ninety six within the walls; sixteen with|out,
but within the Liberties; and nine more in her Suburbs; and in <HI>Fitz&punc; Stephens</HI> time, thirteen
Convents of relgious Orders. It is divided into 26 Wards, governed by so many grave <HI>Aldermen,</HI>
a <HI>Lord Major,</HI> and two <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> the yearly choice whereof was granted them by Patent from King
<HI>Iohn,</HI> in whose time also a Bridge of stone was made over <HI>Thames,</HI> upon nineteen Arches, for length,
breadth, beauty, and building, the like again not found in the World.</P>
<P>(8) This <HI>London</HI> (as it were) disdaining bondage, hath set her self on each side, far without the
walls, and hath le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t her West gate in the midst, from whence with continual buildings (still affect|ing
greatness) she hath continued her streets unto a Kings Palace, and joyned a second City to
her self, famous for the Seat and Sepulchre of our Kings; and for the Gates of Iustice, that termly
there are opened; only once a Bishops See, whose title died with the man. No walls are set about
this City, and those of <HI>London</HI> are left, to shew rather what it was, than what it is: Whose Citizens,
as the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> did, do impute their strength in their men, and not in their walls, how strong
soever. Or else for their multitude, cannot be circulated, but (as another <HI>Ierusalem</HI>) is inhabited
<PB REF="48">
without walls, as <HI>Zachary</HI> said. The wealth of this City (as <HI>Isa</HI> once speak of <HI>Nilus</HI>) grows from
the Revenues and Harvest of her South bounding <HI>Thames;</HI> whose trafique for merchandizing, is
like that of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> whereof <HI>Ezekiel</HI> speaks, and stands in abundance of Silver, Iron, Tinn, and
Lead, &amp;c. And for <HI>London</HI> her channel is navigable, straitned along with meadowing borders,
until she taketh her full liberty in the <HI>German</HI> Seas. Upon this <HI>Thamesis</HI> the Ships of <HI>Tharsis</HI> seem

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>ESSEX, by the <HI>Normans, Excessa,</HI> and by the vulgar <HI>Essex,</HI> is a County large in compass,
very populous, and nothing inferiour to the best of the Land.</P>
<P>(2) The Form thereof is somewhat circular, excepting the East part, which shooteth her
self with many Promontories into the Sea; and from <HI>Horsey Island</HI> to <HI>Haidon</HI> in the West,
(the broadest part of the Shire) are they by measure forty miles; and the length from <HI>East
Ham</HI> upon <HI>Thamesis</HI> in the South, to <HI>Sturmere</HI> upon the River <HI>Stow</HI> in the North, are thirty five miles;
the whole in circumference one hundred forty six miles.</P>
<P>(3) It lyeth bounded upon the North, with <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Cambridge-Shires,</HI> upon the West with <HI>Hert|ford</HI>
and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> upon the South by <HI>Thamesis</HI> is parted from <HI>Kent,</HI> and the East-side thereof is alto|gether
washed with the <HI>German Seas.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Air is temperate and pleasant, only towards the waters somewhat aguish: the soyl is
rich and fruitful, though in some places sandy and barren; yet so that it never frustrates the Husband|mans
hopes, or fills not the hands of her Harvest-labourers: but in some part so fertile, that after
three years glebe of Saffron, the Land for eighteen more, will yield plenty of Barley, without either
dung or other fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ning earth.</P>
<P>(5) Her ancient inhabitants known to the <HI>Romans,</HI> were by <HI>Caesar</HI> called the <HI>Trinobants,</HI> of
whom in the former <HI>Chapter</HI> we have spoken, and in our <HI>History</HI> shall speak more at large. But this
name perished with the age of the Empire, the <HI>Saxons</HI> presently framed a new; and with <HI>Hertford</HI> and
<HI>Middlesex</HI> made it their <HI>East-Saxons</HI> Kingdom, until that <HI>Egb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rt</HI> bought this and the whole into
an entire and absolute Monarchy: the <HI>Danes</HI> after them laid so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ore for this Province, that at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">m|fleet</HI>

for their burials) the <HI>Danewort</HI> with her red berries, so plentifully grow, that it is held and ac|counted
to spring from the blood of the <HI>Danes</HI> which in that place was spilt, and the herb as yet is
called from them the <HI>Danes-bloud;</HI> neither yet were they quelled to surcease that quarrel; but at <HI>Ash|downe</HI>
abode the <HI>Iron side</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, wherein so much blood of the <HI>English</HI> was spilt, that <HI>Canutus</HI> their
King in remorse of conscience, built a Church in the place, to pacifie God for the sins of his people:
but when the <HI>Normans</HI> had got the garland of the whole, many of the Nobles there seated themselves,
whose posterities since, both there and else-where are spread further abroad in the Realm.</P>
<P>(6) The Commodities that this shire yieldeth, are many and great, as of Woods, Corn, Cattle,
Fish, Forrests, and Saffron; which last groweth with such gain and increase upon her North parts,
that from a split Clove much like unto Garlike, a white blewish Flower shortly springeth, from
whence fillets of Saffron are gathered before the Sun, and dried, are sold as spice with great gain.
From the Islands <HI>Canvey, Mersey, Horsey, Northly, Osey, Wallot,</HI> and <HI>Foulness,</HI> great store of Fish and
Fowl are daily gotten: and so from their Cattle have they continual increase, which men and boys
milk; as well the Ewe as the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">; whereof they make great and thick Cheese, sold abroad in the
Land, much thereof transported unto other Countries. Their Oysters which we call <HI>Walfleet,</HI> the
best in esteem, and are thought from <HI>Pliny</HI> to have been served in the <HI>Romans</HI> Kitchins. But least we
should exceed measure in commending, or the people repose their trust in the soyl; behold what
God can do to frustrate both in a moment, and that by his meanest creatures: for in our age and re|membrance,
the year of Christ 158. an Army of <HI>Mice</HI> so over ran the Marshes in <HI>Dengey Hundred,</HI>
near unto <HI>South minster</HI> in this County, that they shore the grass to the very roots, and so tainted
the same with their venemous teeth, that a great Murtain fell upon the Cattle which grazed thereon,
to the great losse of their owners.</P>

<P>SUFFOLK, in regard of them which were seated in <HI>Northfolk,</HI> is a County most plente|ous

<P>(2) The Air is good, sweet, and delectable, and in some parts, of some of our best Phy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">icians,
held to be the best in the Land: the soyl is rich, fruitful, and with all things well replenished; in a
word, nothing wanting for pleasure or profit.</P>
<P>(3) The Form thereof is somewhat <HI>Cressant,</HI> shooting up narrower in the North, and spreading
wider towards the South, whose broadest part is about twenty miles: but from East to West much
more: for from <HI>Easton</HI> point (the furthest of this Shire, yea of all <HI>Britain,</HI> into the Sea) unto great
<HI>Ouse</HI> River, her Western bounder, are forty five miles, and the whole in Circumference, about one

<P>(4) Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ntly this part of the Island was possessed by the <HI>Iceni,</HI> who as it seemeth by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> joy|ned
in Amity with the <HI>Romans, a mighty people</HI> (saith he) <HI>and never shaken with wars</HI> before the

long in these parts they could not do; for the wrongs of the <HI>Icenians</HI> growing intollerable, who
by the <HI>Roman</HI> Souldiers were put out of their rightful possessions, their Princes accounted no better
than Slaves, and their Queen whipped in most ignominious manner; under <HI>Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI> they wrought their
revenge, as in the History (Christ assisting) shall be further related.</P>
<P>Next to these <HI>Icenians,</HI> were the <HI>Saxons</HI> that got their footing into these parts, and of them, this
with <HI>Norfolk, Cambridge-shire,</HI> and the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Ely,</HI> was made their <HI>East-Angles</HI> Kingdom; though
as it seemeth ever in subjection, either to the <HI>Mercians,</HI> or to the Kings of <HI>Kent;</HI> whose off-spring end|ing

<HI>Normans</HI> got their possessions in these parts, whose off-spring are plenteously replenished in this Shire
to this day.</P>
<P>(5) The Commodities of this Shire are many and great, Whereof the chiefest consisteth in Corn,
Cattle, Cloth, Pasturage, Woods, Sea-fish and Fowl; and as <HI>Abba Floriensis</HI> hath depainted,
<HI>this County is of a green and passing fresh hue, pleasantly replenished with Orchards, Gardens and Groves:</HI>
thus he described it above six hundred years since, and now we find as he hath said, to which we
may add their gain from the Pail, whose Cheeses are traded not only throughout <HI>England,</HI> but
into <HI>Germany, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and are highly commended by <HI>Pantaleon</HI> the Physitian, both for

<P>(6) And had <HI>Ipswi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> (the onely eye of this Shire) been as fortunate in her Sirname, as she is
blessed with commerce and buildings, she might worthily have born the title of a City: neither

<P>It seemeth this Town hath been walled about both by a Rampire of Earth, mounted along her

<P>The other eye of this Shire is S. <HI>Edmundsbury.</HI> By <HI>Abbo</HI> the Royal-Town, wherein at the day-break
of the <HI>Saxons</HI> conversion, <HI>Sigebert</HI> King of the <HI>East-Angles</HI> sounded a Christian Church: and
upon the occasion of King <HI>Edmunds</HI> burial (who at <HI>Hoxon</HI> was shot to death) hath been ever since
called S. <HI>Edmundsbury,</HI> where was built to his honour one of the fairest Monasteries in the world,
begun by King <HI>Canute,</HI> much affrighted with the seeming appearance of that Martyrs Ghost, who
to expiate the sacrilegious impiety of his Father <HI>Suenus,</HI> enriched the place with many endowments,
and offered up his own Crown upon the Holy Martyrs Tomb. For the beauty and buildings of
this Abby and Town, let <HI>Leyland</HI> for me declare: <HI>The Sun</HI> (saith he) <HI>hath not seen a City more
finely seated, so delicately, upon the easie ascent of an hill, with a River running on the East side; nor a
more stately Abby, either for revenues or incomperable magnificence, in whose prospect appeareth rather a Ci|ty

than a Monastery, so many Gates for entrance, and some of them brass, so many Towers, and a most
glorious Church, upon which attend three others, standing all in the same Church-yard, all of them passing
fine, and of a curious workmanship.</HI> Whose ruines lie in the dust, lamenting their fall, moving the
beholders to pity their case.</P>
<P>Near unto this Town a great battle was fought by <HI>Robert Bossu,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> against his So|veraign
King <HI>Henry</HI> the second: but was worthily overcome by <HI>Richard Lucy,</HI> the Kings high Iustice,
himself and wife taken, with many Flemings and Englishmen slain.</P>
<P>(7) Other places worthy of remembrance this County affords; such is <HI>Exning</HI> in the West, for|merly
famous for the birth of S. <HI>Audr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> daughter to King <HI>Anna,</HI> one of the three names of the Shires

and <HI>Hadley</HI> in her South, where <HI>Guthrum</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> whom <HI>Elfred</HI> baptized, was buried. And things

vulgarly called the <HI>Devils-ditch:</HI> the like fable is formerly told by <HI>Nubrigensis,</HI> that at <HI>Wulpes</HI> in the

escaped again to the Sea,</P>
<P>As strange, but most true, was a crop of Pease, that without tillage or sowing grew in the Rocks,
betwixt this <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Aldebrough,</HI> in the year 1555, when by unseasonable weather a great dearth
was in the Land; there in <HI>August</HI> were gathered above one hundred Quarters, and in blossoming re|mained
as many more, where never grass grew, or earth ever seen, but hard solid Rocks, three yards
deep under their roots.</P>
<P><PB REF="54">(8) Places separated from common use, and devoted to God and his service by religious Princes,
were at S. <HI>Edmunds, Ipswich, Ikleworth, Blithborow, Clare, Ieston, Burgh</HI> Castle, wherein <HI>Sigebert</HI>
King of the <HI>East Angles</HI> entered the profession of a Monk: but was thence forced by his people, to
fight against the <HI>Mercians:</HI> in which Battle he was slain. And <HI>Dunwich,</HI> where <HI>Foelix</HI> founded his
Episcopal See. These with many others in this County were suppressed in the fall of the Monasteries,
and their Revenues assumed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth.</P>
<P>(9) This Shire is principally divided into three parts, which are called <HI>Celdable,</HI> S. <HI>Edmunds,</HI>
and S. <HI>Andreys</HI> Liberties, subdivided into twenty two Hundreds, and them again into 575 Parish-Churches,
wherein are seated seven Castles, and twenty eight Market-Towns.</P>

<P>NORTHFOLK is an Island inclining to an oval form, closed on the South part

passeth from <HI>Wisbitch</HI> into the <HI>Washes.</HI></P>
<P>It containeth in length (from <HI>Tarmouth</HI> to <HI>Wifbitch</HI>) about fifty miles. In breadth (from <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ford</HI> to
<HI>Wells</HI>) about thirty. The whole Circuit is about two hundred forty two miles.</P>
<P>The Name ariseth from the situation of the people, who being the Norther-most of the Kingdom
of <HI>East-Angles,</HI> are therefore called the <HI>Northfolk,</HI> as the Souther-most <HI>Southfolk.</HI></P>
<P>The Air is sharp and piercing, especially the Champion and near the Sea; therefore it delayeth
the Spring and Harvest, the situation of the Countrey inclining thereto, as being under the 53 degree
of Latitude.</P>
<P>The Soil diverse: about the towns commonly good; as Clay, Chalk, or fat Earth, well watered,
and with some Wood: upward to the Heaths naked, dry and barren: <HI>Marsland</HI> and <HI>Flegge</HI> exceed|ing

These heaths by the compasture of the sheep (which we call <HI>Tathe</HI>) are made so rich with
Corn, that when they fall to be sown, they commonly match the fruitfullest grounds in other Coun|tries:
and laid again, do long after yield a sweeter and more plentiful feed for Sheep: so that each of
them maintain other, and are the chiefest wealth of our Countrey. The <HI>Woodland</HI> (fitter for grass)
is maintained chiefly by feeding of Cattel, yet well stored with Corn and Sheep.</P>
<P>The Coast is fortunate in Fish, and hath many good harbours, whereof <HI>Lynn</HI> and <HI>Tarmouth</HI> be the

<P>The whole County aboundeth with Rivers and pleasant Springs, of which the <HI>Ouse</HI> is the chiefest, by
whose plentiful branches, the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> the Towns and Shires of <HI>Cambridge, Huntington,</HI> and the
County of <HI>Suffolk</HI> vent and receive Commodities. The next is <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rus</HI> or <HI>Yere,</HI> passing from <HI>Norwich</HI>

of Fish at one draught. The <HI>Waveney</HI> and the lesser <HI>Ouse</HI> are also Navigable and of great use. The

<P>(3) The people were anciently called the ICENI, as the also of <HI>Suffolk, Cambridge-shire,</HI> and
<HI>Huntington-shire,</HI> and supposed to be of them whom <HI>Caesar</HI> nameth <HI>Cenimagni; Ptolomy, Simeni;</HI> some
<HI>Tigeni.</HI> Their manners were likely to be as the rest of the <HI>Britains,</HI> barbarous at those times, as ap|peareth
by <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus.</HI> Neither can I otherwise commend their successors the <HI>Saxons;</HI> for so
also their own Countreyman <HI>Ethelward</HI> termeth them. Since the entry of the <HI>Normans,</HI> they have
been counted civil and ingenious, apt to good Letters, adorning Religion with more Churches
and Monasteries, than any Shire of <HI>England,</HI> and the Laws and Seats of Iustice (for many ages)
<PB REF="56">
with some excellent men; from whom most of our chief Families, and some of the greatest Nobility
of the Kingdom, have taken advancement. And herein is <HI>Northfolk</HI> fortunate, that as <HI>Crete</HI> boasted
of an hundred Cities, so may she of an hundred Families of Gentlemen, never yet attainted of high
Treason. How the Government of this County was about <HI>Caesars</HI> time, is uncertain, but (agreeable
no doubt to the rest of the <HI>Britains</HI>) under some peculiar <HI>Toparch</HI> or <HI>Regulus,</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> termeth
him. The latter <HI>Romans</HI> held it by two <HI>Garrisons,</HI> one at <HI>Gariannum</HI> neer <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">armouth;</HI> the other at
<HI>Branodunum,</HI> now called <HI>Brancastre,</HI> both of horse, and commanded by the <HI>Comes Maritimi Tractus,</HI>
as <HI>Mercellinus</HI> calleth him, and termed after <HI>Comes Littoris Saxonici.</HI> Upon the entry of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> this
County with <HI>Suffolk</HI> fell in the portion of the <HI>Angles,</HI> and about the year five hundred sixty one,
were together erected into a Kingdom by <HI>Vffa,</HI> of whom the succeeding Kings were tituled <HI>Vffines.</HI>
But having suffered many Tempests of <HI>Fortune,</HI> it was in the year 870, utterly wasted and extinct by
<HI>Hungar</HI> and <HI>Hubba</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> who overthrew the vertuous King <HI>Edmund</HI> about <HI>Thetford,</HI> and after
martyred him at S. <HI>Edmundsbury.</HI> Yet they did not long enjoy it: for King <HI>Edward</HI> shortly recover|ed
it from them, and annexed it to his other Kingdoms. The <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI> notwithstanding inhabited
abundantly in these parts, so that many of our Towns were sounded by them, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d a great part of our
people and Gentry are risen out of their bloud.</P>
<P>(4) This Kingdom of <HI>East-Angles</HI> was after allotted to an Earldom of that name by <HI>William</HI>
the <HI>Conquero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> who made <HI>Radulph</HI> a <HI>Britain,</HI> marrying his Kinswoman, Earl thereof; but gave
the greatest parts of this County about <HI>Wimonham, Keninghall, Lenn, Burnham, Fulmerstone,</HI> &amp;c. to
<HI>W. de Albany, Pincerne,</HI> and <HI>W. de Warranna Forrestario,</HI> who to strengthen themselves (according to
the use of that time) with the homage and service of many Tenants, divided large portions of the
same amongst their friends and followers; so that most of the Mannors and Lands in the parts afore|said,
were in those days either mediately or immediately holden of one of them. And as <HI>Northfolk</HI>
<PB REF="56">
and <HI>Suffolk</HI> were first united in a Kingdom, then in an Earldom, so they continued united in the
<HI>Sheriff-wick</HI> till about the fifteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>(5) The Towns here are commonly well built, and populous; three of them being of that
worth and quality, as no one Shire of <HI>England</HI> hath the like, <HI>Norwich, Lynn,</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth:</HI> to which
for ancient reputation (as having been a seat of the Kings of <HI>East-Angles</HI>) I may add <HI>Thetford,</HI>
known to <HI>Antoninus, Ptolomy,</HI> and elder ages by the name of <HI>Sitomagus,</HI> when the other three were
yet in their infancy, and of no esteem: For I accept not the Relations of the Antiquity and State of
<HI>Norwich</HI> in the time of the <HI>Britains</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> though <HI>Alexander Nevil</HI> hath well graced them. Her
very name abridgeth her Antiquity, as having no other in Histories but <HI>Norwich,</HI> which is meer
<HI>Saxon</HI> or <HI>Danish,</HI> and signifieth the <HI>North-Town</HI> or <HI>Castle.</HI> It seemeth to have risen out of the decay of
her neighbour <HI>Venta,</HI> now called <HI>Castor,</HI> and as M. <HI>Cambden</HI> noteth, not to have been of mark before
the entry of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who in the year 1004, under <HI>Swane</HI> their Captain, first sackt, and then
burnt it, even in her infancy. Yet in the days of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor</HI> it recovered 1320 Burges|ses.
But maintaining the cause of Earl <HI>Radulph</HI> aforesaid against the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> they were by
famine and sword wasted to 560, at which time the Earl escaping by Ship, his wife upon composition
yielded the Castle, and followed. In <HI>William Rufus</HI> time it was grown famous for Merchandise and
concourse of people; so that <HI>Herbert</HI> then translated the Bishoprick from <HI>Thetford</HI> thither, made
each of them an ornament to other. In variety of times it felt much variety of <HI>Fortune:</HI> By fire
in <HI>Anno</HI> 1508. By extreme plagues, whereof one in <HI>Anno</HI> 1348, was so outragious, as 57104
are reported to have died thereof between the <HI>Calends</HI> of <HI>Ianuary</HI> and of <HI>Iuly.</HI> By misery of war
was sacked and spoiled by the Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Hugh Bigod, Anno</HI> 1174. In yielding to <HI>Lewis</HI> the
<HI>French,</HI> against their natural Lord King <HI>Iohn, Anno</HI> 1216. By the disinherited Barons, <HI>Anno</HI> 1266.
By tumult and insurrection between the Citizens and Church-men: once about the year 1255.
<PB REF="57">
which if <HI>Henry</HI> the third had not come in person to appease, the City was in hazard to be ruined
the second time in <HI>Anno</HI> 1446, for which the Mayor was deposed, and their Liberties for a while
seised. In <HI>Edward</HI> the sixths time, by <HI>Ketts</HI> rebellion, whose fury chiefly raged against this City.
Since this it hath flourished with the blessings of <HI>Peace, Plenty, Wealth,</HI> and <HI>Honour:</HI> so that <HI>Alexander
Nevil</HI> doubteth not to prefer it above all the Cities of <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>London.</HI> It is situate upon
the River <HI>Hierus,</HI> in a pleasant valley, but on rising ground, having on the East the Hills and Heath
called <HI>Mussold</HI> for <HI>Musswould,</HI> as I take it. In the 17 year of King <HI>Stephen</HI> it was new founded, and
made a Corporation. In <HI>Edward</HI> the firsts time closed with a fair Wall, saving on a part that the
River defendeth. First governed by four Bayliffs; then by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth in <HI>Anno</HI> 1403, erected in|to
a Majoralty and County; the limits whereof now extend to <HI>Eatonbridge.</HI> At this present it hath
about thirty Parishes, but in ancient time had many more.</P>
<P>(6) <HI>Lynn</HI> having been an ancient Borough, under the government of a <HI>Bayliff</HI> or <HI>Reve,</HI> called
<HI>Praepositus,</HI> was by King&punc; <HI>Iohn</HI> in the sixth year of his Reign made <HI>Liber Burgus,</HI> and (besides the gift
of his memorable Cup, which to this day honoureth his Corporation) endowed with divers fair
Liberties. King <HI>Henry</HI> the third in the Seventeenth year of his Reign (in recompence of their servi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
against the out-lawed <HI>Barons</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Ely</HI>) enlarged their Charter, and granted them further,
to choose a Major <HI>Loco Praepositi:</HI> unto whom King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the sixteenth year of his
Reign, added twelve Aldermen, a Recorder, and other Officers, and the bearing of a Sword be|fore
the Mayor. But the Town coming after to the same King, he in the ewenty ninth of his
Reign, changed their name, from <HI>Maior &amp; Burgensis Lynn Episcopi,</HI> to <HI>Maior &amp; Burgenses Lynn
Regis.</HI></P>

two Bayliffs by King <HI>Henry</HI> the thrid, and by his Charter, about the fifteenth year of his Reign,
walled. It is an ancient member of the <HI>Cinque Ports,</HI> very well built and fortified, having only one
Church (but fair and large) founded by Bishop <HI>Herbert</HI> in <HI>William Rufus</HI> days. It maintaineth a
Peer against the Sea, at the yearly charge of five hundred pound, or thereabout: yet hath it no
possessions as other Corporations, but like the Children of <HI>Aeolus</HI> and <HI>Thetis; maria &amp; 4 ventos,</HI> as an

which draweth great concourse of people, and maketh the Town much the richer all the year, but
very unsavory for the time. The Inhabitants are so courteous, as they have long held a custom to
feast all persons of worth, repairing to their Town.</P>
<P>(8) The Bishoprick of <HI>Norwich</HI> had first her seat at <HI>Dunwich</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and was there begun by
<HI>Faelix,</HI> who converted this County, and the <HI>East-Angles</HI> to the Faith. Being brought out of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI>
by <HI>Sigebert</HI> (the first Christian King of the <HI>East-Angles</HI>) he landed at <HI>Babingley</HI> by <HI>Lynn,</HI> and there
builded the first Church of these Countries, which in his memory, is at this day called by his Name.
The second he built at <HI>Sharneburn</HI> then of wood, and therefore called <HI>Stock Chappel.</HI> After
<HI>Faelix</HI> and three of his Successors, this Bishoprick was divided into two Sees; the one with eleven
Bishops in succession, continuing at <HI>Dunwich;</HI> the other with twelve, at <HI>Elmham</HI> in <HI>Northfolk.</HI>
Then united again in the time of King <HI>Edwin,</HI> the entire See for twelve other Bishops remained at
<HI>Elmham,</HI> and in the <HI>Conquerours</HI> time was by his Chaplain <HI>Arfastus</HI> (being the thirtieth) translated to
<HI>Thetford,</HI> from thence by <HI>Herbert</HI> (his next Successour save one) bought of <HI>W. Rufus</HI> for 1900
pounds, and brought to <HI>Norwich.</HI> This <HI>Herbert</HI> (sirnamed <HI>Losinga</HI> a <HI>Norman</HI>) builded the Cathedral
Church there, and endowed it with large possessions. Not far from thence he also builded another
Church to S. <HI>Leonard,</HI> a third at <HI>Elmham,</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ourth at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ynn,</HI> (S. <HI>Margarets</HI> a very fair one) and the

fifth at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> before mentioned. By the Cathedral Church he builded a Palace for the Bishops,
and founded the Priory there (now converted to <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI>) and another Priory at <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t|ford.</HI>
Since his time the Bishops See hath immoveably remained at <HI>Norwich,</HI> but the ancient Possessions

<P>(2) This Province is not large, nor for air greatly to be liked, having the Fens so
spread upon her North, that they infect the Air far into the rest: from whose furthest point

in Circumference, traced by the compass of her many indents, one hundred twenty and eight miles.</P>

<P><PB REF="59">Of this City, in the year of <HI>Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> as the Monk of <HI>Button</HI> doth report, nine Scholars

North-ward, seated themselves near unto the <HI>Bridge,</HI> whereupon the place began to be called <HI>Grant|bridge,</HI>
though others from the crooked River <HI>Came</HI> will have it named <HI>Cambridge.</HI> This place
(though sacred and exempted from <HI>Mars,</HI> as <HI>Sylla</HI> once spake, when he spared <HI>Athens,</HI>) the <HI>Danes</HI>
in their destructions regarded no whit, wherein they often wintered after their spoyls, and left the
scars of their savage sores ever behind them. And in the year 1010, when <HI>Suen</HI> in his fierceness

<HI>Harwood,</HI> stood suddenly still, and refrained to pass any further; so that forward, men passed three
miles together on foot in the very depth of her Channel; and backward, the waters swelled unto a
great height: which was observed by the judicious, to foretel some unkind diuision that shortly
should arise.</P>

<P>(2) The length thereof extended from <HI>Bristow</HI> upon the River <HI>Avon</HI> in her South,
unto <HI>Clifford</HI> upon another <HI>Avon</HI> in her North, are about forty eight miles; and her
broadest part from East to West, is from <HI>Lechland</HI> unto <HI>Preston,</HI> containing twenty eight: the whole
circumference about one hundred thirty eight miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Form whereof is somewhat long and narrow: the Air thereof is pleasant, sweet, and
delectable; and for fruitfulness of Soyl hear <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> and not me; The ground of this Shire
throughout (<HI>saith he</HI>) yieldeth plenty of Corn, and bringeth forth abundance of Fruits; the one through
the natural goodness only of the ground, the other through the diligent manuring and tillage, in such
wise, that it would provoke the laziest person to take pains. Here you may see the High-ways, and
Common Lanes clad with Apple-trees and Pear-trees, not ingraffed by the industry of mens hand,
but growing naturally of their own accord: the ground of it self is so inclined to bear fruits, and those
both in taste and beauty far exceeding others, and will endure until a new supply come. There is not
any County in <HI>England</HI> so thick set with Vineyards as this Province is, so plentiful of increase, and
so pleasant in taste. The very Wines made thereof carry no unpleasant tartness, as being little inferi|our
in sweet Verdure to the <HI>French</HI> Wines; the houses are innumerable, the Churches passing fair, and
the Towns standing very thick. But that which addeth unto all good gifts (a special glory) is the Ri|ver

<P>(6) These, with all other provisions, are traded thorow twenty five <HI>Market-Towns</HI> in this Coun|ty,
whereof two are Cities of no small import: the first is <HI>Glocester,</HI> from whom the Shire taketh
name, seated upon <HI>Severn,</HI> near the middest of this Shire, by <HI>Antonin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the Emperour called <HI>Glou|um,</HI>
built first by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and set as it were upon the neck of the <HI>Silures,</HI> to yoke them, where
their legion called <HI>Colonia Gleuum,</HI> lay. It hath been walled about (excepting that part that is
defended by the River) the ruines thereof in many places appear; and some part yet standing,
doth well witness their strength. This City was first won from the <HI>Britains</HI> by <HI>Cheulin</HI> the first King
<PB REF="72">
of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> about the year of Christ, 570, and afterwards under the <HI>Mercians</HI> it flourished
with great honour, where <HI>Offrick</HI> King of <HI>Northum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erland,</HI> by the sufferance of <HI>Ethelred</HI> of <HI>Mercia,</HI>
founded a most stately <HI>Monastery</HI> of <HI>Nuns,</HI> whereof <HI>Kineburgh, Edbergh,</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> Queens of the <HI>Mer|cians,</HI>

<P>(7) <HI>Edelfled</HI> a most renowned Lady, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ister to King <HI>Edward</HI> the elder, in this City built a fair
Church, wherein her self was interred, which being overthrown by the <HI>Danes,</HI> was afterwards rebuilt,
and made the Cathedral of that See, dedicated unto the honour of S. <HI>Peter.</HI> In this Church the un|fortunate
Prince, King <HI>Edward</HI> the second, under a Monument of <HI>Alablaster</HI> doth lye; who be|ing

until through extream anguish he ended his life. And before any of these, in this City say
our <HI>British Historians,</HI> the body of <HI>Lucius</HI> our first Christian King was interred: and before his days
the <HI>Britains Arviragus.</HI></P>
<P>The graduation of this County I observe from this City, whence the Pole is elevated in the de|gree
of Latitude 52, and 14 minutes, and in Longitude from the West, 18, and 5 minutes.</P>
<P>(8) The other City is <HI>Bristow,</HI> fair, but not very ancient, built upon the Rivers <HI>Avon</HI> and <HI>Frome,</HI>
for trade of Merchandize a second <HI>London,</HI> and for beauty and account next unto <HI>York.</HI> This City

<PB REF="72">
a Tyrant from <HI>Africk&punc;</HI> besieging this City, tyed fire unto the wings of Sparrows, who lighting in the
Town upon light matter, set flame upon all. The circuit of whose walls extended two miles a|bout,
wherein the Consular Port or ways of the <HI>Romans</HI> met and crossed each other. This City was
won from the <HI>Britains</HI> by <HI>Cheulin</HI> first King of the <HI>West Saxons:</HI> afterwards it was possessed by
the <HI>Mercians;</HI> and lastly, by the <HI>Danes</HI> under <HI>Gurm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd</HI> (the former no doubt mistaken for him) where|in
a rable of them kept the space of a year, <HI>Anno</HI> 879, and never since inhabited, according to the
circuit of her walls.</P>
<P>(10) Places of memorable note are these: The <HI>Island Alney</HI> near unto <HI>Glocester,</HI> wherein <HI>Edmund
Iron-side</HI> the <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Canutus</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> after many battles and bloud, fought in single Combat
hand to hand alone, until they compounded for the Kingdoms partition: <HI>Barkley Castle,</HI> where
King <HI>Edward</HI> the second was thorow his fundament run into his bowels with a red burning Spit:
<HI>Tewkesbury</HI> the fatal period of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth his government, and the wound of the <HI>Lanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">strian</HI>
Cause; for in a battle there fought in <HI>Anno</HI> 1471, Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> the only son of King <HI>Henry,</HI> had
his brains dashed out in a most shameful manner, the Queen and his Mother taken prisoners, and most
of their favourites slain and beheaded. And at <HI>Alderley,</HI> a little Town standing eight miles from the
<HI>Severne,</HI> upon the Hills to this day are found <HI>Cockles, Periwincles,</HI> and <HI>Oysters</HI> of solid stone, which
whether they have been Shel-fish and living creatures, or else the sports of <HI>Nature</HI> in her works, let
the <HI>Natural Philosophers</HI> dispute of and judge.</P>
<P>(11) The places of piety, set apart from other worldly Services, and dedicated to religious uses
by the devotions of Princes, erected in this Shire, were <HI>Tewkesbury, Deor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ust, Glocester, Minching,

Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> wherein himself and his <HI>Dutchesse</HI> was interred. Their Son

revealed to eye-sight such gross Idolatries, and the skirts of Superstition were were turned up, to the

<P>(12) Dukes and Earls that have born the title of <HI>Glocester,</HI> the first of every <HI>Family</HI> are by their
Arms and Names expressed, ever fatal to their Dukes, though the greatest in bloud and birth. The

<P>The greatest glory that this City received, was in King <HI>Athelstans</HI> days; where (as <HI>Malmesbury</HI>

dead sleep, with a roaring noise removed from the place where it stood, and for three days toge|ther
travelled from her first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ite, to the great amazement and fear of the beholders. It began to jour|ney
upon the seventh day of <HI>February,</HI> being sunday, at six of the Clock at night, and by seven in
the next morning had gone forty paces, carrying with it Sheep in their coats, hedge-rows, and
trees; whereof some were overturned, and some that stood upon the plain, are firmly growing
upon the hill; those that were East were turned West; and those in the West were set in the East:
in which remove, it overthrew <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters">aston-Chappel,</HI> and turned two high-ways near an hundred yards
from their usual paths formerly trod. The ground thus travelling, was about twenty six Acres,
which opening it self with Rocks and all, bare the earth before it for four hundred yards space with|out
any stay, leaving that which was Pasturage in place of the Tillage and the Tillage overspread

<P>(3) The Air of this Shire is of a favourable temperature, that gives an appetite for labour, diet,
and rest: The Soyl is fertile, and to me seemed inferiour to none other in this Land: for besides the
abundance of Corn in every place spread, the Woods and Pasturage in her hills and Plains, sweet
Rivers that water the Vallies below, the Cattle that cover the tops of higher ground; the Fields,
Hedge-rows, and High-ways are beset with fruitful Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-trees that yield great pleasure to sight,
and commodious use: for with their juyce they make a bastard kind of Wine, called <HI>Perry,</HI> which
is both pleasant and good in taste. Many <HI>Salt Springs</HI> also this County affordeth: yea, and more
than are commonly in use, such with the <HI>Germans,</HI> our ancient Predecessors, were esteemed most
sacred and holy; so that (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> writeth) to such they wontedly resorted to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pplicate their Gods

<HI>Oxford-shires,</HI> and the West from <HI>Warwick</HI> with <HI>VVatling-street-way, Avon,</HI> and <HI>VVeland</HI>
is divided from <HI>Leicester.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The Form of this County <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s large and narrow, broadest in the South-west; and thence
shoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing still lesser like unto a Horn, nor not much unlike to the Form of <HI>Cornwal:</HI> and from the

the whole in circumference one hundred and nineteen miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is good, temperate, and healthful: the soyl is champion, rich, and fruitful, and so
plenteously peopled, that from some Ascents, thirty Parish-Churches, and many more Wind-mills at
one view may be seen: notwithstanding the simple and gentle Sheep, of all creatures the most harm|less, are now become so ravenous, that they begin to devour men, waste fields, and depopulate
ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ses, if not whole Town-Ships, as one merrily hath written.</P>
<P>(4) The ancient people known to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and recorded by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> were the <HI>Coritany,</HI> who
possessed this County, and were branched further thorow <HI>Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham, Rutland,</HI>
and <HI>Darby-shires:</HI> these joyning with the <HI>Icenians,</HI> with them were fettered with the chains of sub|jection,
when for <HI>Claudius, Publius Ostorius Scapula</HI> entred his Lieutenantship in <HI>Britain,</HI> and in
<PB REF="82">
battle subdued all betwixt the Rivers <HI>Nene</HI> and <HI>Sabrina.</HI> But when the <HI>Romans</HI> were content to let
go that which so long was desired, and had cost so much in the getting, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> a most warlike Na|tion,
put into these parts, and made it a portion of their <HI>Mercian Kingdom:</HI> but their government
also grown out of date, the <HI>Normans</HI> seated themselves in these fair possessions, the branches of whose
Stems, are spread abroad in these parts, most fruitful and fair.</P>
<P>(5) Commodities arising in this Shire, are chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fly gotten by tillage and plough, whereby Corn
so plentifully aboundeth, that in no other Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y is found more, or so much: the pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ures and woods
are filled with Cattle, and every where sheep loaden with their sleeces of wool.</P>
<P>(6) The chief Town in this Shire is <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">thampton</HI> whereof the County taketh name, which
for circuit, beauty, and building, may be ranked with the most of the Cities of our Land. It is seat|ed
at the meeting and confluence of two Rivers, the greater whereof beareth the name <HI>Nen.</HI> This
Town hath been built all of stone, as by many foundations remaining to this day is seen, and is
walled about both strong and high, excepting the West, which is defended by a River parted into
many streams. In the depredations of the <HI>Danes, Swen</HI> their King set this Town on fire, and after|wards
it was sorely assaulted by the disobedient <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rons</HI> of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> who named themselves, <HI>The
Army of God:</HI> But the loyalty of this Town stood nothing so sure unto King <HI>Henry</HI> his son,
whence the <HI>Barons</HI> with displayed Banners sounded the Battle against their Soveraign. And yet af|ter
this a woful field of <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">glands</HI> civil division was fought, whence <HI>Richard Nevil,</HI> the stout Earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> led away prisoner that unfortunate man King <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ry</HI> the sixth. Upon the West part of
this Town standeth a large Castle, mounted upon an hill: whose aged countenance well sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">weth
the beauty that she had born, and whose gaping chinks do daily threaten the downfall of her
walls. To this upon the South the Town wall adjoyneth, and in a round circuit meeteth the

<P>(6) The Castle supposed by some the work of the elder <HI>Edward,</HI> but seemingly by the Book of

<HI>Sentlice</HI> and the King of <HI>Scots, Henry</HI> the second laid it as you see; yet doth it remain the head of
that honour, on which in other Shires many Knights Fees, and sixteen in this attended. Here <HI>David</HI>

<HI>Northampton-shire;</HI> and the West is altogether held in with <HI>Leicester-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The Form thereof is round, and no larger in compass than a light horse man can
easily ride about in a day: upon which occasion some will have the Shire named of one
<HI>Rut,</HI> that so rode. But others from the redness of the Soyl, will have it called <HI>Rutland;</HI> and so the old
<HI>English-Saxo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> called it, for that <HI>Roet</HI> and <HI>Rut</HI> is in their Tongue <HI>Red</HI> with us, and may very well
give the name of this Province, seeing the earth doth stain the wool of her Sheep into a reddish co|lour.
Neither is it strange, that the stain of the Soyl gives names unto places, and that very many:
for have we not in <HI>Che-shire</HI> the <HI>Red Rock,</HI> in <HI>Lanca-shire</HI> the <HI>Red Bank,</HI> and in <HI>Wales Rutland Castl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI>
To speak nothing of that famous <HI>Red Sea,</HI> which shooteth into the Land betwivt <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI>
which gave back her waters for the <HI>Israelites</HI> to pass on foot: all of them named from the colour of
the Soile.</P>
<P>(3) The longest part of this Shire is from <HI>Caldecot</HI> in the South upon the River <HI>Ey,</HI> unto <HI>Thistle|ton</HI>
a small Village seated in the North, not fully twelve miles: and from <HI>Timwell</HI> East-ward, to
<HI>Wissenden</HI> in the West, her broadest extent is hardly nine: the whole circumference about forty miles.</P>
<P>(4) The Air is good both for health and delight, subject to neither extremity of heat nor cold,
nor is greatly troubled with foggy mists.</P>
<P><PB REF="91">The Soil is rich, and for Corn and tillage gives place unto none. Woods there are plenty, and
many of them imparked, Hills feeding heards of Neat, and flocks of Sheep; Vallies besprinkled with
many sweet springs; Grain in abundance, and Pastures not wanting: in a word, all things ministred
to the content of life, with a liberal heart and open hand. Only this is objected, that the Circuit is
not great.</P>

here he seated, and made publick profession of the Liberal Sciences, where (as he saith) a great
number of Scolars Studied the Arts, and so continuing an University unto the coming of <HI>Augustine,</HI>
at which time the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> interdicted it, for certain Heresies sprung up among the <HI>Britains</HI>
and <HI>Saxons.</HI> But most true it is, that the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, upon debate falling be|twixt
the Southern and Northern Students at <HI>Oxford,</HI> many School-men withdrew themselves hi|ther,
and a while professed, and named a Colledge, according to one in <HI>Oxford, Brazen-nose,</HI> which
retaineth that name unto this day. This was so great a skar unto the other, that when they were
recalled by Proclamation to <HI>Oxford,</HI> it was provided by Oath, that <HI>no Student in Oxford should publickly
profess or read in the Arts at Stanford, to the prejudice of Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>(9) As this Shire is the least in circuit, so is it with the fewest Market-Towns replenished, having
onely two. And from societies that feed upon the labours of others, was this Land the freest: for be|sides <HI>Rishal,</HI> where <HI>Tibba</HI> the <HI>Falconers</HI> Goddess was worshiped for a Saint, when Superstition had

<P>LEICESTERSHIRE, lyeth bordered upon the North with <HI>Nottingham-shire;</HI> upon the
East with <HI>Lincoln</HI> and <HI>Rutland;</HI> upon the South with <HI>Northampton-shire;</HI> upon the West
with <HI>Watling-street-way,</HI> is parted from <HI>Warwick-shire;</HI> the rest being bounded with the con|fines
of <HI>Darby,</HI> is a County Champion, abounding in Corn, but sparing of woods, especi|ally
in the South and East parts, which are supplyed with Pit-coals plenteously gotten in
the North of this Province, and with abundance of Cattle bred in the hills beyond the River <HI>Wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ak,</HI>
which is nothing so well inhabited as the rest.</P>
<P>(2) The Air is gentle, milde, and temperate, and giveth appetite both to labour and rest:
wholesome it is, and draweth mans life to a long age, and that much without sickness; at <HI>Carleton</HI>
onely some defect of pronunciation appeareth in their speech.</P>
<P>(3) The Soil thus consisting, the Commodities are raised accordingly of Corn, Cattle, and
Coals; and in the Rocks near <HI>Bever</HI> are sometimes found the <HI>Astroites,</HI> the Star-like precious
Stone.</P>
<P>(4) The ancient people that inhabited this County, were the <HI>Coritani,</HI> who were spread further
into other Shires, but after that the <HI>Romans</HI> had left the Land to it self, this with many more fell to
be under the possession and government of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and their Kings, from whom the <HI>English</HI>
enjoyed it at this day.</P>
<P>(5) In Circular-wise (almost) the compass of this Shire is drawn indifferently spacious, but
not very thick of Inclosures, being from East to West in the broadest part not fully 30 miles, and
<PB REF="93">
from North to South but 24 the whole circumference about 196 miles: whose principal City is set, as
the Center, almost in the midst; from whom the Pole is elevated 53 degrees, and 4 minutes in Lari|tude,
and for Longitude, 19 degrees, 22 minutes.</P>
<P>(6) From this Town the Shire hath the name, though the name of her self is diversly written, as
<HI>Legecestria, Legara, Leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o-cester:</HI> by <HI>Ninius, Caer-Lerion;</HI> by <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> (if we do not
mistake him) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">irall;</HI> and now lastly, <HI>Leicester:</HI> ancient enough if King <HI>Leir</HI> was her builder, eight
hundred and forty and four years before the birth of our Saviour, wherein he placed a Flamine to
serve in the Temple of <HI>Ianus,</HI> by himself there erected, and where he was buried, if <HI>Ieffery ap Ar|thur</HI>
say true: but now certain it is, that <HI>Ethelred</HI> the <HI>Mercian</HI> Monarch made it an Episcopal See, in
the year of Christ Iesus 680, wherein <HI>Sexwul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> of his el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ction became the first Bishop; which short|ly
after was thence translated, and therewith the beauty of the Town began to decay; upon whole
desolations that erectifying Lady <HI>Edelfled</HI> cast her eyes of compassion, and both re-edified the build|ings,
and compassed it about with a strong wall, where, in short time the Cities Trade so increased,
that <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> in his lesser Stor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> reporteth as followeth; <HI>Lege-cester</HI> (saith he) <HI>is a right wealthy
City, and notably defe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ded; and had the wall a sure foundation, were inferiour to no City whatsoever.</HI>
But this pride of prosperity long lasted not under the <HI>Normans,</HI> for it was sore oppressed with a world
of Calamities, when <HI>Robert Bossu</HI> the Crouch-back Earl of that Province, rebelled against his Sove|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aign
Lord King <HI>Henry</HI> the second: whereof hear the same Author <HI>Paris</HI> speak: <HI>Through the obstina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
stubbornness of Earl Robert</HI> (saith he) <HI>the whole City</HI> Leicester <HI>was besieged and thrown down by</HI>
King Henry, <HI>and the Wall that seemed indissoluble, was utterly raced even to the ground.</HI> The pieces
of these Fragments so fallen down remained in his days like to hard Rocks, through the strength
of the Morter cementing whole lumps together: and at the Kings command the City was
set on fire and burnt, the Castle raced, and a heavy imposition laid upon the Citizens, who with
<PB REF="94">
great sums of money bought their own banishments: but were so used in their departure, that
for extream fear many of them took Sanctuary, both at S. <HI>Edmunds</HI> and S. <HI>Albans,</HI> In repentance
of these mischiefs, the Author thereof, Earl <HI>Robert,</HI> built the Monastery of S. <HI>Mary de Pratis,</HI>
wherein himself became a Canon Regular, and for fifteen years continuance in sad laments served
God in continual prayers. With the like devotion, <HI>Henry</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> built an Hospi|tal,
for an hundred and ten poor people, with a Collegiate Church, a Dean, twelve Canons Preben|daries,
as many Vicars, suffciently provided for with Revenues; wherein himself lyeth buried: and it
was the greatest ornament of that City, until the hand of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth lay over-heavy upon
all the like foundations; and laid their aspiring tops at his own feet.</P>
<P>The fortunes of another <HI>Crouch-back</HI> (King <HI>Richard</HI> Usurper) who no less remarkable in this
City than the former <HI>Robert</HI> was, both of them in like degree of dishonourable course of <HI>life,</HI> though
of different <HI>issue</HI> at their deaths, the one dying penitent and of devout esteem; the other leaving
the stench of Tyranny to all following ages; who from this City setting forth in one day with
great pompe, and in Battle aray, to keep the Crown sure upon his own Helmet, in a sore fought
field, yieldeth both it and his life, unto the head and hands of <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Richmond</HI> his Conque|rour:
and the next day was brought back, like a Hog, naked and torn, and with contempt, without
tears obscurely buried in the <HI>Gray Friers</HI> of this City; whose suppression had suppressed the plot
place of his grave, and only the stone-chest wherein he was laid (a drinking trough now for horses
in a common Inn) retaineth the memory of that great Monarchs Funeral: and so did a stone in the
Church and Chappel of S. <HI>Maries;</HI> inclose the Corps of the proud and pontifical cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> who
had prepared for himself, as was said, a far more richer Monument.</P>
<P>(7) Other places worthy of remembrance in this Shire were these: In the West, where a high
Cross was erected, in former times stood the fair City <HI>Cleycester,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> BENONNE,
<PB REF="94">
where their Legions lay, and where their two principal ways crossed each other, as the Inhabi|tants
report: <HI>Loughborow</HI> in the North verge, was (as <HI>Marianus</HI> affirmeth) taken from the <HI>Britains</HI>
by <HI>Cuthwolse</HI> their King, about the year of Christ 572.</P>
<P>At <HI>Redmore,</HI> near <HI>Bosworth,</HI> Westward in this County, the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> lay in hazard
of one Battle, when King <HI>Richards</HI> field was fought, where the Land at once was free from a Ty|rant
and wicked Usurper. Neither may we pass <HI>Lutterworth,</HI> as the least in account, where the fa|mous
<HI>Iohn Wickliff, Englands</HI> Morning star, dispersed the clouds of all Papistical darkness, by preach|ing
the Gospel in that his charge; the stile of his pen, so piercing in power, that the man of Sin ever
since hath been better known to the world.</P>
<P>(8) Religious houses by Princes erected, and by them devoted to God and his service, the chie|fest
in this Shire were at <HI>Leicester, Grace-Dieu, Kerby-Bellers,</HI> and at <HI>Burton</HI> a Spittle for <HI>Lazers,</HI> a dis|ease
then newly approached in this Land, for the erection whereof a common contribution was ga|thered
thorow the Realm: the patients in this place were not so much deformed in skin, as the o|ther
were in the defects of the soul; whose skirts being turned up to the sight of the world, their
shames were discovered, and those houses dissolved, that had long maintained such Idolatrous sins.</P>
<P>(9) This Shires division is into six Hundreds, and in them are seated twelve Market-Towns for
commerce, and containeth in circuit two hundred Parish-Churches.</P>

<P>THe County of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> by the <HI>Normans</HI> called <HI>Nicolshire,</HI> is confined on the North with
<HI>Hamber,</HI> on the East with the <HI>German Ocean,</HI> upon the South, is parted from <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>

<P>(2) The length of this Province extendeth from <HI>Barton</HI> unto <HI>Humber</HI> in the
North, unto <HI>Stanford</HI> upon the River <HI>Nyne</HI> in the South, are miles by our <HI>English</HI> mea|sure
fifty five, and the breadth thereof from <HI>Newton</HI> in the West stretched unto <HI>Winthorp</HI> upon her East
Sea containeth thirty five. The whole in circumference about one hundred and eighty miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air upon the East and South part is both thick and foggy, by reason of the Fens and un|solute
grounds, but therewithal very moderate and pleasing. Her graduation being removed from the
Aequator to the degree of 53 and the winds that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ent of her still working-Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to disperse those va|pours
from all power of hurt.</P>
<P>(4) The Form of this County doth somewhat resemble the body of a Lute, whose East-coasts lye
bow-like into the <HI>German-Ocean,</HI> all along pestered with inlets of salt waters and sands, which are
neither firm nor safe for travellers, as those in the South proved unto King <HI>Iohn,</HI> who marching North|ward
from <HI>Northfolk,</HI> against his disloyal Barons, upon those washes lost all his furniture and carriage
by the sudden return of the Sea, and softness of the Sands.</P>
<P>(5) Her Soil upon the West and North is abundantly fertile, pleasant and rich, stored with
pasturage, arable and meadowing grounds; the East and South Fenny and brackish, and for Corn,
<PB REF="96">
barren; but for fowl and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h exceeding any other in the Realm; wherein, at some times and sea|sons
of the year, hath been taken in nets, in <HI>August,</HI> at one draught, aboue three thousand Mallards,
and other Fowls of the like kind.</P>
<P>(6) The Shires commodities consist chiefly in Corn, Cattle, Fish, Fowl, Flax and Alablaster;
as also in a Plaister much esteemed of by the <HI>Romans</HI> for their works of Imagery; and whereof
<HI>Pliny</HI> in his <HI>Natural History</HI> maketh mention. And the <HI>Astori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> a precious sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e, Star-like, point|ed

ploughed up a brazen vessel, wherein was inclosed a golden Helmet of an ancient fashion, set with
precious stones, which was presented to <HI>Katherine</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> Wife and Dowager to King <HI>Henry</HI> the
eighth.</P>
<P>(7) This Shire triumpheth in the birth of <HI>Beauclerk,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, whom <HI>Selby</HI> brought
forth, and of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, at <HI>Bullingbrooke</HI> born; but may as justly lament for the death
of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> herein poisoned by <HI>Simon</HI> a Monk of <HI>Swynsted Abbey;</HI> and of Queen <HI>Eleanor,</HI> wife to
King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, the mirrour of wedlock, and love to the Commons, who at <HI>Hardby,</HI> near
<HI>Bullingbrooke,</HI> his birth-place, ended her life.</P>
<P>(8) Trade and commerce for provision of life is vented thorow thirty one Market-Towns
in this Shire, whereof <HI>Lincoln</HI> the Counties Namer is chief, by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Antonine</HI> called <HI>Lindum,</HI>
by <HI>Beda Linde-Collina,</HI> and by the <HI>Normans, Nichol.</HI> Very antient it is, and hath been more Magni|fical,
as by her many overturned ruines doth appear, and far more populous, as by <HI>Doomesdayes</HI>
Book is seen, where it is recorded that this City contained a thousand and seven mansions, and
nine hundred Burgesses with twelve Lage-men, having Sac and Soc. And in the <HI>Normans</HI> time, saith
<HI>Malmesbury,</HI> it was one of the best Cities of <HI>England,</HI> being a place of traffick of Merchan|dize
<PB REF="96">
for all commerce by Land or Sea. Herein King <HI>Edward</HI> the third ordained his Staple for the
Mart of Wools, Leather and Lead; and no less than fifty Parish-Churches did beautifie the same:
but now containeth onely fifteen, besides the Cathedral. Some ruines yet remain both of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">riari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI>
and <HI>Nunneries,</HI> who lie buried in their own ashes, and the City conquered, not by war, but by time
and very age: and yet hath she not escaped the calamity of Sword, as in the time of the <HI>Saxons,</HI>
whence <HI>Arthur</HI> enforced their Host: the like also did <HI>Edmund</HI> to the destroying <HI>Danes;</HI> and by the
<HI>Normans</HI> it suffered some damage, where King <HI>Stephen</HI> was vanquished and taken prisoner; and a|gain,

for defaced, wherein not only the buildings were consumed, but wihal many men and women in
the violence thereof perished: as also by an Earth quake her foundation was much weakened and
shaken, wherein the fair Cathedral Church, dedicated to the Virgin of Virgins, was rent in pieces.
The government of this City is committed yearly to a Mayor, two Sheriffs, twelve Aldermen in
Scarlet, a Sword, a Hat of Estate, a Recorder, Sword-bearer, and four Serjeants with Maces:
whose situation on a steep hill standeth for Longitude, in the degree 20, 10 scruples, the Pole elevated
for Latitude from the degree 53, and 50 scruples.</P>
<P>(9) Much hath been the devotion of Princes in building of religious houses in this County, as at
<HI>Crowland, Lincoln, Markby, Leyborn, Grenfeld, Alvingham, Newnersby, Grymmysby, Newsted, Elshaw,
Stansfeld, Syxhill, Torkesey, Bryggerd, Thor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eholme, Nuncotten, Fosse, Hovings, Axholme Isle, Gokewell,</HI>

<P>(10) Commotions in this shire were raised the eight and twentieth of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight,
where twenty thousand making insurrection, violently sware certain Lords and Gentlemen to
their Articles. But no sooner they heard of the Kings power coming, but they dispersed them|selves,
<PB REF="97">
and sued for pardon. And again in the third year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixt, in ease of Inclo|sures,
<HI>Lincoln</HI> rose in seditious manner, as did they of <HI>Cornwall, Devonshire, York-shire,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk:</HI>
but after some slaughters of their chiefest men, were reduced to former obedience.</P>
<P>The Shires division is into three principal parts, viz. <HI>Lindsey, Kesteven,</HI> and <HI>Holland; Lindsey</HI> is subdi|vided
into seventeen Hundreds, <HI>Kesteven</HI> into eleven, and <HI>Holland</HI> into three, containing in all thirty

is from <HI>Tong</HI> in the East, to <HI>Oswestre</HI> fited at the head of <HI>Morda</HI> in the West, twenty and five miles:
the whole in circuit about, extending to one hundred thirty four miles.</P>
<P>(3) Wholesome is the Air, delectable and good, yielding the Spring and the Autumn, Seed-time
and Harvest, in a temperate condition, and affordeth health to the Inhabitants in all seasons of the
year.</P>
<P>(4) The Soil is rich, and standeth most upon a reddish Clay, abounding in Wheat and Barley, Pit|coals,
Iron and Woods; which two last continue not long in league together. It hath Rivers that
make fruitful the Land, and in their Waters contain great store of fresh-fish, whereof <HI>Severn</HI> is the
chief, and second in the Realm, whose stream cutteth this County in the midst, and with many wind|ing

<P>(5) This River was once the bounds of the <HI>North-Britains,</HI> and divided their possession from

where (in remembrance of him) the place is yet called <HI>Caer-Caradoc,</HI> a Fort of his won by <HI>P. Ostorius</HI>
Lieutenant of the <HI>Romans,</HI> about the year of Grace 53. The <HI>Cornavii</HI> were seated upon the North of
<HI>Severn,</HI> and branched into other Counties, of whom we have said.</P>
<P>(6) But when the strength of the <HI>Romans</HI> was too weak to support their own Empire, and <HI>Britain</HI>
emptied of her Souldiers to resist, the <HI>Saxons</HI> set foot in this most fair Soil, and made it a part of their
<HI>Mercian</HI> Kingdom: their line likewise issued to the last period, and the <HI>Normans</HI> beginning where
these <HI>Saxons</HI> left, the <HI>VVelshmen</HI> took advantage of all present occasions, and brake over <HI>Severn</HI> unto
the River <HI>Dee;</HI> to recover which, the <HI>Normans</HI> first Kings often assayed, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Second with
such danger of Life, that at the Siege of <HI>Bridge-North</HI> he had been slain, had not Sir <HI>Hubert Syncler</HI>
received the Arrow aimed at him, in stepping betwixt that Shaft and his Soveraign, and therewith was
shot thorow unto death. In the like danger stood <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who in the strait Siege of
<HI>Ludlow,</HI> begirt by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> had been plucked from his Saddle with an Iron-hook from the Wall,
had not <HI>Stephen</HI> presently rescued him, <HI>Anno</HI> 1139.</P>
<P>(7) This then being the <HI>Marches</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>VVales,</HI> was sore afflicted by bloody broils,
which caused many of their Towns to be strongly walled, and thirty two Castles to be strongly
built: Lastly, into this County the most wise King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh sent his eldest Son Prince
<HI>Arthur,</HI> to be resident at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> where that fair Castle became a most famous Princes Court
And here King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight ordained the Council of the <HI>Marches,</HI> consisting of a Lord Presi|dent

for the most part in presence of that honourable President.</P>

Swords have been stirring in most parts of this Province, so Beads have been hid for the preser|vation

<P>And let me add thus much, which <HI>Lucian</HI> could not: namely, that this Shire hath never been
stained with the blot of Rebellion, but ever stood true to their King and his Crown: whose loyal|ty
<HI>Richard</HI> the Second so far found and esteemed, that he held his Person most safe among them
and by the Authority of Parliament made the County to be a <HI>Principality,</HI> and stiled himself <HI>Prince of
Chester.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third gave it to his eldest Son Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> against whom <HI>Lewlin</HI> Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI> gathered a mighty Band, and with them did the County much harm, even unto the Cities

a Wall made of the <HI>Welsh-mens</HI> Heads, on the South side of <HI>Dee</HI> in <HI>Hambridge.</HI></P>
<P>The Shire may well be said to be a <HI>Seed-plot of Gentility,</HI> and the producer of many most ancient
and worthy Families: neither hath any brought more men of valour into the <HI>Field,,</HI> than <HI>Chess-shire</HI>
hath done, who by a general speech, are to this day called, <HI>The chief of Men:</HI> and for <HI>Natures</HI> endow|ments
(besides their nobleness of minds) may compare with any other Nation in the World: their
Limbs straight and well-composed, their complexions fair, with a chearful countenance; and the Wo|men
for grace, feature, and beauty inferiour unto none.</P>
<P>(6) The Commodities of of this Province (by the report of <HI>Ranulphus</HI> the Monk of <HI>Chester</HI>) are
chiefly <HI>Corn, Cattle, Fish, Fowl, Salt, Mines, Metals, Mears</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> whereof the Banks of <HI>Dee</HI>
in her West, and the <HI>Vale-Royal</HI> in her midst, for fruitfulness of pasturage equals any other in the
Land, either in grain or gain from the Cow.</P>
<P>(7) These, with all other provision for life, are traded thorow thirteen Market-Towns in this
Shire, whereof <HI>Chester</HI> is the fairest, from whom the Shire hath the name. A City raised from the
Fort of <HI>Ostorius,</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Britain</HI> for <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperour, whither the twentieth Legion (na|med

<P>On the South of this City is mounted a strong and stately Castle, round in form, and the base
Court likewise inclosed with a circular Wall. In the North is the Minster, first built by Earl <HI>Leofrike</HI>

of <HI>Chester</HI> of the <HI>Normans,</HI> now the Cathedral of the Bishops See. Therein lyeth interred (as report

<P>This City hath formerly been sore defaced; first by <HI>Egfrid</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> where he slew
twelve hundred Christian Monks, resorted thither from <HI>Bangor</HI> to pray. Again by the <HI>Danes</HI> it was
sore defaced, when their destroying feet had trampled down the beauty of the Land. But was again re|built
by <HI>Edelfleada</HI> the <HI>Mercian Lady,</HI> who in this County, and Forrest of <HI>Delamer,</HI> built two fine Cities,
nothing of them now remaining, besides the <HI>Chamber</HI> in the <HI>Forrest.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chester</HI> in the daies of King <HI>Edgar</HI> was in most flourishing estate, wherein he had the homage of
eight other Kings, who rowed his <HI>Barge</HI> from S. <HI>Iohns</HI> to his Palace, himself holding the Helm, as their
Supream.</P>
<P>This City was made a County incorporate of it self by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, and is yearly

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE County Palatine of <HI>Lancaster</HI> (famous for the four <HI>Henries,</HI> the fourth, fifth, sixth, and
seventh, Kings of <HI>England,</HI> derived from <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI>) is upon the
South, confined and parted by the River <HI>Mersey,</HI> from the County Palatine of <HI>Chester;</HI>
the fair County of <HI>Darby-shire</HI> bordering upon the East; the large County of <HI>York-shire</HI>
together with <HI>Westmerland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> being her kind neighbours upon the North,
and the Sea called <HI>Mare Hibernicum,</HI> embracing her upon the West.</P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is long, for it is so inclosed between <HI>York-shire</HI> on the East side, and the <HI>Irish-Sea</HI>
on the West, that where it boundeth upon <HI>Cheshire</HI> on the South-side, it is broader, and by little
and little more Northward it goeth (confining upon <HI>Westmerland</HI>) the more narrow it groweth. It
containeth in length from <HI>Brathey</HI> Northward, to <HI>Halwood</HI> Southward, fifty seven miles; from <HI>Den|ton</HI>
in the East, to <HI>Formby</HI> by <HI>Altmouth</HI> in the West, thirty one; and the whole circumference in com|pass,
one hundred threescore and ten miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is subtile and piercing, not troubled with gross vapours or foggy mists, by reason
whereof the People of that Country live long and healthfully, and are not subject to strange and un|known
diseases.</P>
<P>(4) The Soil for the generality is not very fruitful, yet it produceth such numbers of Cattel
of such large proportion, and such goodly heads, and horns, as the whole Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI>
doth scarce the like. It is a Country replenished with all necessaries for the use of Man, yielding
without any great labour, the commodity of Corn, Flax, Grass, Coals, and such like. The
<PB REF="110">
Sea also addeth her blessing to the Land, that the People of that Province want nothing that serveth
either for the sustenance of Nature, or the satiety of appetite. They are plentifully furnished with all
sorts of Fish, Flesh, and Fowls. Their principal Fuell is Coal and Turff, which they have in
great abundance, the Gentlemen reserving their Woods very carefully, as a beauty and principal
ornament to their Mannors and Houses. And though it be far from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ondon,</HI> (the Capital City of
this Kingdom) yet doth it every year furnish her and many other parts of the Land besides, with
many thousands of Cattel (bred in this Country) giving thereby, and other ways, a firm testimony
to the World, of the blessed abundance that it hath pleased God to enrich this noble Dukedom
withall.</P>
<P>(5) This Counties ancient Inhabitants were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> of whom there is more mention in the
description of <HI>York-shire,</HI> who by <HI>Claudius</HI> the Emperour were brought under the <HI>Roman</HI> subjection,
that so held aud made it their Seat, secured by their Garrisons, as hath been gathered as well by many
Inscriptions found in Walls and ancient Monuments fixed in Stones, as by certain Altars erected in
favour of their Emperours. After the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> brought it under their protection, and held
it for a part of their <HI>Northumbrian</HI> Kingdom, till it was first made subjugate to the Invasion of the
<HI>Danes,</HI> and then conquered by the victorious <HI>Normans,</HI> whose Posterities from thence are branched fur|ther
into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>(6) Places of antiquity or memorable note are these: the Town of <HI>Manchester</HI> (so famous, as well
for the Market-Place, Church and Colledge, as for the resort unto it for Clothing) was called <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">u|nium</HI>
by <HI>Antonine</HI> the Emperour, and was made a Fort and Station of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Riblechester</HI> (which taketh the name from <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ibell,</HI> a little River near <HI>Clith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>) though it be a small
Town, yet by Tradition hath been called the richest Town in Christendom, and reported to have
been the Seat of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which the many Monuments of their Antiquities, Statues, Pieces of
<PB REF="111">
Coin, and other several Inscriptions, digg'd up from time to time by the Inhabitants, may give us suffici|ent
perswasion to believe.</P>
<P>But the Shire Town is <HI>Lancaster,</HI> more pleasant in situation, than rich of Inhabitants, built on the
South of the River <HI>Lon,</HI> and is the same <HI>Longovicum,</HI> where (as we find in the <HI>Noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Provinces</HI>) a com|pany
of the <HI>Longovicarians</HI> under the Lieutenant General of <HI>Britain</HI> lay. The beauty of this Town is in
the Church, Castle, and Bridge: her Streets many, and stretched fair in length. Unto this Town King
<HI>Edward</HI> the Third granted a Mayor and two Bailiffs, which to this day are elected out of twelve Bre|thren,
assisted by twenty four Burgesses, by whom it is yearly governed, with the supply of two Cham|berlains,
a Recorder, Town-Clerk, and two Sergeants at Mace. The elevation of whose Pole is in
the degree of Latitude 54 and 58 scruples, and her Longitude removed from the West point unto the
degree 17 and 40 scruples.</P>
<P>(7) This Country in divers places suffereth the force of many flowing Tides of the Sea, by which
(after a sort) it doth violently rent asunder one part of the Shire from the other: as in <HI>Fourness,</HI> where
the Ocean being displeased that the shore should from thence shoot a main way into the West, hath
not obstinately ceased from time to time to slash and mangle it, and with his Fell irruptions and boy|sterous
Tides to devour it.</P>
<P>Another thing there is, not unworthy to be recommended to memory that in this Shire, not far from
<HI>Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rness-Felles,</HI> the greatest standing water in all <HI>England</HI> (called <HI>Winander Mere</HI>) lieth, stretched out
for the space of ten miles, of wonderful depth, and all paved with stone in the bottom: and along the
Sea-side in many places may be seen heaps of sand, upon which the People pour water until it recover
a saltish humour, which they afterwards boil with Turffs, till it become white Salt.</P>
<P>(8) This Country, as it is thus on the one side freed by the natural resistance of the Sea from the
force of Invasions, so is it strengthened on the other by many Castles, and fortified places, that take
<PB REF="111">
away the opportunity of making Roads and Incursions in the Country. And as it was with the first
that felt the fury of the <HI>Saxons</HI> cruelty, so was it the last and longest that was subdued under the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st-Saxons</HI>
Monarchy.</P>
<P>(9) In this Province our noble <HI>Arthur</HI> (who died laden with many Trophies of honour) is report|ed
by <HI>Ninius</HI> to have put the <HI>Saxons</HI> to flight in a memorable Battel near <HI>Duglasse,</HI> a little Brook not
far from the Town of <HI>Wiggin.</HI> But the attemps of War, as they are several, so they are uncertain;
for they made not Duke <HI>Wade</HI> happy in his success, but returned him an unfortunate enterpriser in
the Battel which he gave to <HI>Ardulph</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> at <HI>Billango,</HI> in the year 798. So were
the events uncertain in the <HI>Civil Wars</HI> of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster:</HI> for by them was bred and brought
forth that bloody division, and fatal strife of the Noble Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ses, that with variable success to both
Parties (for many years together) molested the peace and quiet of the Land, and defiled the earth
with blood, in such violent manner, that it exceeded the horror of those <HI>Civil Wars</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> that
were betwixt <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Scylla, Pompey</HI> and <HI>Caesar, Octavius</HI> and <HI>Antony;</HI> or that of the two re|nowned
Houses <HI>Valoys</HI> and <HI>Burbon,</HI> that a long time troubled the State of <HI>France:</HI> for in the division
of these two Princely Families there were thirteen Fields fought, and three Kings of <HI>England,</HI> one
Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> twelve Dukes, one Marquess, eighteen Earls, one Vicount, and three and twenty Ba|rons,
besides Knights and Gentlemen, lost their lives in the same. Yet at last by the happy Marriage
of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, King of <HI>England,</HI> next Heir to the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> with <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter
and Heir to <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, of the House of <HI>York,</HI> the white and red Roses were conjoyned in the
happy uniting of those two divided Families, from whence our thrice renowned Soveraign Lord King
<HI>Iames,</HI> by fair sequence and succession, doth worthily enjoy the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">adem: by the benefit of whose hap|py
government, this County Palatine of <HI>Lancaster</HI> is prosperou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in her Name and Greatness.</P>
<P><PB REF="112">(10) I find the remembrance of four Religious Houses that have been founded within this County
(and since suppressed) both fair for Structure and Building, and rich for seat and Situation: namely,
<HI>Burstogh, VVhalleia, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Penwortham.</HI> It is divided into six Hundreds, besides <HI>Fourness Felles,</HI>
and <HI>Lancasters Liberties,</HI> that lie in the North part. It is beautified with fifteen Market-Towns, both
fair for situation and building, and famous for the concourse of people for buying and selling. It hath
twenty six Parishes, besides Chappels, (in which they duly frequent to Divine Service) and those popu|lous,
as in no part of the Land more.</P>

<P>AS the courses and confluents of great Rivers, are for the most part fresh in memory, though
their heads and fountains lie commonly unknown: so the latter knowledg of great Re|gions,
are not traduced to oblivion, though perhaps their first originals be obscure, by
reason of Antiquity, and the many revolutions of times and ages. In the delineation
therefore of this great Province of <HI>York-shire,</HI> I will not insist upon the narration of
matters near unto us; but succinctly run over such as are more remote: yet neither so sparingly, as I
may seem to diminish from the dignity of so worthy a Country; nor so prodigally, as to spend time in
superfluous praising of that which never any (as yet) dispraised. And although perhaps it may seem a
labour unnecessary, to make relation of ancient remembrances either of the Name or Nature of this Na|tion,
especially looking into the difference of Time it self (which in every age bringeth forth divers ef|fects)
and the dispositions of men, that for the most part take less pleasure in them, than in divulging
the occurrents of their own times: yet I hold it not unfit to begin there, from whence the first certain
direction is given to proceed; for (even of these ancient things) there may be good use made, either
by imitation, or way of comparison, as neither the reperition, nor the repetition thereof shall be ac|counted impertinent.</P>
<P>(2) You shall therefore understand: That the County of <HI>York</HI> was in the <HI>Saxon</HI>-tongue called
<HI>Ebona ycyne,</HI> and now commonly <HI>York-shire,</HI> far greater and more numerous in the Circuit of her
miles, than any Shire of <HI>England.</HI> She is much bound to the singular love and motherly care of Na|ture,
in placing her under so temperate a clime, that in every measure she is indifferently fruitful.
<PB REF="114">
If one part of her be stone, and a sandy barren ground: another is fertile and richly adorned with
Corn-fields. If you here find it naked, and destitute of Woods, you shall see it there shadowed with
Forrests full of Trees, that have very thick bodies, sending forth many fruitful and profitable branches-
If one place of it be Moorish, miry, and unpleasant; another makes a free tender of delight, and pre|sents
it self to the Eye, full of beauty and contentive variety.</P>
<P>(3) The Bishoprick of <HI>Durham</HI> fronts her on the North-side, and is separated by a continued course
of the River <HI>Tees.</HI> The <HI>German-Sea</HI> lyeth sore upon her East-side, beating the shores with her boiste|rous
Waves and Billows. The West part is bounded with <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and <HI>Westmerland.</HI> The South|side
hath <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Darby-shire</HI> (friendly Neighbours unto her) with the which she is first inclosed:
then with <HI>Nottingham</HI> and with <HI>Lincoln-shires:</HI> after divided with that famous Arm of the Sea <HI>Humber;</HI>
Into which all the Rivers that water this Country, empty themselves, and pay their ordinary Tri|butes,
as into the common receptacle and store-house of <HI>Neptune,</HI> for all the watry Pensions of this
Province.</P>
<P>(4) This whole Shire (being of it self so spacious) for the more easie and better ordering of her
Civil Government, is divided into three parts: which according to three quarters of the World, are
called, <HI>The West-Riding, The East-Riding,</HI> and <HI>The North-Riding. West-Riding</HI> is for a good space com|passed
with the River <HI>Ouse,</HI> with the bounds of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and with the South limits of the Shire, and
beareth towards the West and South. <HI>East-Riding</HI> bends it self to the Ocean, with the which, and
with the River <HI>Derwent</HI> she is inclosed, and looks into that part where the Sun rising, and shewing
forth his Beams, makes the World both glad and glorious in his brightness. <HI>North-Riding</HI> extends
it self <HI>Northward,</HI> hemmed in as it were with the River <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Derwent,</HI> and a long race of the
River <HI>Ouse.</HI> The length of this Shire, extended from <HI>Horthill</HI> in the South, to the mouth of <HI>Tees</HI> in
the North, are neer unto seventy miles, the breadth from <HI>Flambrough-head</HI> to <HI>Horn-Castle</HI> upon the
<PB REF="114">
River <HI>Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> is fourscore miles; the whole Circumference is three hundred and eight miles.</P>
<P>(5) The Soil of this County for the generality is reasonable fertile, and yields sufficiency of Corn
and Cattle within it self. One part whereof is particularly made famous by a Quarry of Stone, out of
which the stones newly hewn be very soft, but seasoned with wind and weather of themselves do natu|rally
become exceeding hard and solid. Another, by a kind of <HI>Limstone</HI> whereof it consisteth, which
being burnt, and conveyed into the other parts of the Country, which are hilly and somewhat cold,
serve to manure and enrich their Corn fields.</P>
<P>(6) That the <HI>Romans</HI> flourishing in military prowess, made their several stations in this Country,
is made manifest by their Monuments, by many Inscriptions fastned in the Walls of Churches, by ma|ny
Columns engraven with <HI>Roman</HI> work lying in Church-yards, by many votive Altars digg'd up that
were erected (as it should seem) to their Tutelar Gods (for they had local and peculiar Topick Gods,
whom they honoured as Keepers and Guardians of some particular Places of the Country) as also by
a kind of Brick which they used: for the <HI>Romans</HI> in time of peace, to avoid and withstand idleness (as
an enemy to vertuous and valorous enterprises) still exercised their Legions and Cohorts in casting of
Ditches, making of High-ways, building of Bridges, and making of Bricks, which having sithence been
found, and from time to time digg'd out of the ground, prove the Antiquity of the place by the <HI>Roman</HI>
Inscriptions upon them.</P>
<P>(7) No less argument of the piety hereof, are the many Monasteries, Abbeys and Religious
Houses that have been placed in this Country; which whilest they retained their own state and
magnificence, were great ornaments unto it: but since their dissolution, and that the Teeth of Time
(which devours all things) have eaten into them, they are become like dead Carkasses&punc; leaving only
some poor Ruins and Remains alive, as Reliques to Posterity, to shew of what beauty and mag|nitude
they have been. Such was the Abbey of <HI>Whitby,</HI> founded by Lady <HI>Hilda,</HI> daughter of the
<PB REF="115">
grand-child unto King <HI>Edwine.</HI> Such was the Abbey built by <HI>Bolton,</HI> which is now so razed and laid
level with the earth, as that at this time it affords no appearance of the former dignity. Such was <HI>Kirk|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">alt</HI>
Abbey, of no small account in time past, founded in the year of <HI>Christ</HI> 1147. Such was the re|nowned

<HI>Lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"> Britain</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> but since converted into the Princes House, and is called <HI>The Mannor.</HI>

<P>These places for Religion erected, with many more within this Provincial Circuit, and consecrated
unto holy purposes, shew the antiquity, and how they have been sought unto by confluences of Pilgrims
in their manner of Devotions: The mists of which superstitious obscurities, are since cleared by the
pure light of the Gospel revealed, and the skirts of Idolatry unfolded to her own shame and ignominy:
And they made subject to the dissolution of Times, serving only as antique Monuments and remem|brances
to the memory of succeeding Ages.</P>
<P>(8) Many places of this Province are famous as well by Name, being naturally fortunate in their
situation, as for some other accidental happiness befaln unto them. <HI>Hallifax,</HI> famous, as well for that

and for the greatness of the Parish, which reckoneth in it eleven Chappels, whereof two be Parish
Chappels, and in them to the number of twelve thousand People.</P>
<P>In former times it was called <HI>Horton,</HI> and touching the alteration of the name, this pretty story is
<PB REF="115">
related of it; namely, That a Clerk (for so they call him) being far in love with a Maid, and by no
means either of long praises or large promises, able to gain like affection at her hands, when he saw
his hopes frustrate, and that he was not like to have his purpose of her, turned his love in rage, and cut
off the Maids head, which being afterwards hung upon an Ewe-tree, common people counted it as an
hallowed Relique till it was rotten: And afterwards (such was the credulity of that time) it main|tained
the opinion of reverence and Religion still: for the People resorted thither on Pilgrimage, and
perswaded themselves, that the little Veins that spread out between the Bark and Body of the Ewe trees
like fine threds, were the very Hairs of the Maids head. Hereupon it was called by this name <HI>Halig|fax,</HI>
or <HI>Halyfax,</HI> that is, <HI>Haly Hayre.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pomfret</HI> is famous for the Site, as being seated in a place so pleasant, that it brings forth <HI>Liqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rice</HI>
and great plenty of <HI>Skirtworts,</HI> but it is infamous for the murther and bloodshed of Princes: The Ca|stle

<P>(9) But I will sorbear to be prolix or tedious in the particular memoration of places in a Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|vince
so spacious, and only make a compendious relation of <HI>York,</HI> the second City of <HI>England,</HI> in
Latine called <HI>Eboracum</HI> and <HI>Eburacum;</HI> by <HI>Ptolomy, Brigantium</HI> (the chief City of the <HI>Brigants</HI>) by
<HI>Ninius, Caer Ebrauc;</HI> by the <HI>Britains, Caer Effroc.</HI> The <HI>British</HI> History reports that it took the Name
of <HI>Ebrau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> that founded it; but some others are of opinion, that <HI>Eburacum</HI> hath no other derivation
than from the River <HI>Ous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> running thorow it: It over-masters all the other places of this Country
for fairness, and is a singular ornament and safeguard to all the North-parts. A pleasant place, large,
and full of magnificence, rich, populous, and not only strengthened with fortifications, but adorned
with beautiful buildings, as well private as publick. For the greater dignity thereof, it was made
an Episcopal See by <HI>Constantius,</HI> and a Metropolitane City by a <HI>Pall</HI> sent unto it from <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">rius
<PB REF="116">
Egbert</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>York,</HI> who flourished about the year seven hundred forty erected in it a most fa|mous
Library. <HI>Richard</HI> the third repaired the Castle thereof being ruinous, and King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight
appointed a Council in the same, to decide and determine all the Causes and Controversies of the
North parts, according to Equity and Conscience: which Council consisteth of a Lord President, cer|tain
Counsellors at the Princes pleasure, a Secretary, and other Under-Officers.</P>
<P>The original of this City cannot be fetcht out but from the <HI>Romans,</HI> seeing the <HI>Britains</HI> before the
<HI>Romans</HI> came, had no other Towns than Woods fenched with Trenches and Rampiers, as <HI>Caesar</HI> and
<HI>Strabo</HI> do testifie. And that it was a Colony of the <HI>Romans,</HI> appears both by the Authority of <HI>Ptolomy</HI>
and <HI>Antonine,</HI> and by many ancient Inscriptions that have been found there. In this City the Empe|ror
<HI>Severus</HI> had his Palace, and here gave up his last breath; which ministers occasion to shew the an|cient
custom of the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the military manner of their burials.</P>
<P>His body was carried forth here by the Souldiers to the funeral fire, and committed to the flames,
honoured with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">usts and Turnaments both of the Souldiers, and of his own Sons: His ashes be|stowed
in a little golden pot or vessel of the Porphyrat stone, were carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> and shrined there
in the Monument of the <HI>Antonines.</HI> In this City (as <HI>Spartianus</HI> maketh mention) was the Temple of
the Goddess <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">llona;</HI> to which <HI>Severu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> (being come thither purposing to offer Sacrifice) was erroni|ously
led by a rustical <HI>Augur.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Fl. Valerius Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">stantius,</HI> surnamed <HI>Choru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> (an Emperour of excellent vertue and Christian
Piety) ended his life, and was Deified as appears by ancient Coins: and his Son <HI>Constantine</HI> being
present at his Fathers death; forthwith proclaimed Emperour; from whence it may be gathered
of what great estimation <HI>York</HI> was in those days, when the <HI>Romans</HI> Emperours Court was held in it.
This City flourished a long time under the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> Dominion, till the <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> like a mighty
Storm, thundering from out of the North-East, destroyed it, and distrained it with the blood of many
<PB REF="116">
slaughtered persons, and wan it from <HI>Olbright</HI> and <HI>Ella</HI> Kings of <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">thumberland,</HI> who were both stain
in their pursuit of the <HI>Danes:</HI> which <HI>Alcuine</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Egelred</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> seemed
to presage before, when he said; <HI>What signifieth that raining down of blood in</HI> St. Peters <HI>Church of</HI> York,
<HI>even in a fair day, and descending in so violent and threatning a manner from the top of the roof? may
it not be thought that blood is coming upon the Land from the North parts?</HI></P>
<P>Howbeit <HI>Athelstane</HI> recovered it from the <HI>Dantsh</HI> subjection, and quite overthrew the Castle with
the which they had fortified it; yet was it not (for all this) so freed from Wars, but that it was sub|ject
to the Times fatally next following. Nevertheless in the <HI>Conquerors</HI> time, when (after many wo|ful
overthrows and troublesom storms) it had a pleasant calm of ensuing Peace, it rose again of it self,
and flourished afresh, having still the helping hand of Nobility and Gentry, to recover the former dig|nity,
and bring it to the perfection it hath. The Citizens senced it round with new Walls, and ma|ny
Towers and Bulwarks, and ordaining good and wholsome Laws for the government of the same:
Which at this day are executed at the command of a Lord Mayor, who hath the assistance of twelve
Aldermen, many Chamberlains, a Recorder, a Town-Clerk, six Sergeants at Mace, and two Esquires,
which are, a Sword-bearer, and the Common Sergeant, who with a great Mace goeth on the left
hand of the Sword. The Longitude of this City, according to <HI>Mercators</HI> account, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">9 degrees, and
35 scruples: the Latitude 54 degrees and forty scruples.</P>
<P>(10) Many occurents present themselves with sufficient matter of enlargement to this discourse,
yet none of more worthy consequence than were those several Battels, fought within the compass of this
County; wherein Fortune had her pleasure as well in the proof of her love, as in the pursuit of her ty|ranny;
sometime sending the fruits of sweet peace unto her, and other whiles suffering her to taste the
sowreness of War.</P>
<P><PB REF="117">At <HI>Conisborough</HI> (in the <HI>Britain</HI> Tongue <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r-Conan</HI>) was a great Battel fought by <HI>Hengist,</HI> Captain
of the <HI>English-Saxons,</HI> after he had retired himself thither for his safety, his men being fled and scat|tered,
and himself discomfited by <HI>Aurelius Ambrosius;</HI> yet within few days after, he brought forth his
men to Battel against the <HI>Britains</HI> that pursued him, where the field was bloody both to him and his;
for many of his men were cut in pieces, and he himself had his head chopt off, as the <HI>British</HI> History
saith; which the Chronicles of the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> deny, reporting that he died in peace, being sur|charged
and over-worn with the troublesom toils and travels of War.</P>
<P>Neer unto <HI>Kirkstall, Oswie</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> put <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nda</HI> the <HI>Mercian</HI> to flight: the place
wherein the Battel was joyned, the Writers call <HI>Winwid-Field,</HI> giving it the name by the Victory: And
the little Region about it (in times past called by an old name <HI>Elmet</HI>) was conquered by <HI>Eadwin</HI> King
of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> the son of <HI>Aela,</HI> after he had expelled <HI>Cereticus</HI> a <HI>British</HI> King, in the year of
Christ, 620.</P>
<P>At <HI>Casterford</HI> (called by <HI>Antonine Legiotium</HI> and <HI>Legetium</HI>) the Citizens of <HI>York</HI> slew many of King
<HI>Ethelreds</HI> Army, and had a great hand against him, in so much as he that before sat in his Throne of
Majesty, was on a sudden daunted, and ready to offer submission.</P>
<P>But the most worthy of memory, was that Field fought on <HI>Palm Sunday,</HI> 1461. in the quarrel of
<HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> where <HI>England</HI> never saw more puissant Forces both of Gentry and Nobility:
for there were in the Field at one time (partakers on both sides) to the number of one hundred thousand
fighting men. When the fight bad continued doubtful a great part of the day, the <HI>Lancastrians</HI> not a|ble
longer to abide the violence of their enemies, turned back and fled amain, and such as took part
with <HI>York,</HI> followed them so hotly in chase, and killed such a number of Nobles and Gentlemen, that
thirty thousand <HI>Englishmen</HI> were that day left dead in the Field.</P>
<P>(11) Let us now loose the point of this Compass, and sail into some other parts of this Province,
<PB REF="117">
to find out matter of other memorable moment. Under <HI>Knausbrough</HI> there is a Well called <HI>Dropping
Well,</HI> in which the waters spring not out of the veins of the earth, but distill and trickle down from the
Rocks that hang over it: It is of this vertue and efficacy, that it turns Wood into Stone: for what Wood
soever is put into it, it will be shortly covered over with a stony bark, and be turned into Stone, as hath
been often observed.</P>
<P>At <HI>Giggleswick</HI> also about a mile from <HI>Settle</HI> (a Market-Town) there are certain small Springs not
distant a quaits cast from one another: the middlemost of which doth at every quarter of an hour ebb
and flow about the height of a quarter of a yard when it is highest, and at the ebb falleth so low, that
it is not an inch deep with water. Of no less worthiness to be remembred is St. <HI>Wilfrids</HI> Needle, a
place very famous in times past for the narrow hole in the close vaulted room under the ground, by
which womens honesties were wont to be tried, for such as were chaste pass thorow with much facility;
but as many as had plaid false, were miraculously held fals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, and could not creep thorow. <HI>Believe if you

<P>The credible report of a Lamp found burning (even in our Fathers remembrance, when Abbeys were
pulled and suppressed) in the Sepulchre of <HI>Constantius,</HI> within a certain Vault or little Chappel under
the ground, wherein he was supposed to have been buried, might beget much wonde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> and admiration,
but that <HI>Lazius</HI> confirmeth, that in ancient times they had custom to preserve light in Sepul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hres, by
an artificial resolving of Gold into a liquid and fatty substance, which should continue burning a long
time, and for many ages together.</P>
<P>(12) This <HI>York-shire</HI> Picture I will draw to no more length, lest I be condemned with the <HI>Sophister,</HI>
for insisting in the praise of <HI>Hercules,</HI> when no man opposed himself in his discommendation. This

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Bishoprick of Durham,</HI> containeth those parts and Town-ships that lie betwixt the Ri|ver
<HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Derwent,</HI> and all along the <HI>German Seas.</HI> It is neighboured on the North
with <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and their Iurisdictions parted by the River <HI>Derwent:</HI> her West is
touched by <HI>Cumberland, Westmorland,</HI> and from <HI>Stain-More</HI> divided by the River <HI>Tees,</HI>
and by the same water on her South, from <HI>York-shire</HI> even unto the Sea; and the East is
altogether coasted by the <HI>German-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is triangular, and sides not much differing; for from her South-East, unto the
West-point, are about thirty miles: from thence to her North-east and <HI>Tyne-mouth,</HI> are likewise as
many, and her base along the Sea shore are twenty-three miles; the whole in circumference, about
one hundred and three miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is sharp and very piercing, and would be more, were it not that the vapours from the
<HI>German-Seas</HI> did help much to dissolve her Ice and Snow; and the store of Coals therein growing and
gotten, do warm the body, and keep back the cold; which fewel besides their own use, doth yield
great commodities unto this Province&punc; by trade thereof into other parts.</P>
<P>(4) For Soil, it consisteth much alike of Pastures, Arable, and barren grounds; the East is the
richest and most champion, the South more moorish, but well inhabited; her West all rocky, with|out
either Grass or Grain, notwithstanding recompenceth her possess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rs with as great gain, both in
rearing up Cattel, and bringing forth Coal, whereof all this County is plentifully stored, and
groweth so near to the upper face of the earth, that in the trod-ways the Cart-wheels do turn
<PB REF="119">
up the same. Some hold their substance to be a clammy kind of clay hardned with heat abounding in
the earth, and so becoming concocted, is nothing else but <HI>Bitumen;</HI> for proof whereof, these Coals
have both the like smell and operation of <HI>Bitumen:</HI> for being sprinkled with water, they burn more ve|hemently,
bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> with oyl are quite extinguished and put out.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants known unto <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> of whom we have spoken
in the General of <HI>York-shire,</HI> they being subdued by the <HI>Romans;</HI> after whom the <HI>Saxons</HI> made it a
part of their <HI>Northumberland Kingdom;</HI> at first a Province belonging to the <HI>Deirians,</HI> and enjoyed
by <HI>Ella</HI> their first King; afterwards invaded by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and lastly possessed by the <HI>Normans:</HI> whose
site being so near unto <HI>Scotland,</HI> hath many times felt their fury, and hath been as a Buckler betwixt
them and the <HI>English;</HI> for which cause the Inhabitants have certain freedoms, and are not charged
with service as other Counties are, so that this with <HI>Westmorland, Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI>
are not divided into hundreds in those Parliament Rolls whence I had the rest; which want I must
leave for others to supply.</P>
<P>(6) Over this County, the Bishops thereof have had the Royalties of Princes; and the Inhabi|tants
have pleaded priviledge not to pass in service of War over the River of <HI>Tees</HI> or <HI>Tyne;</HI> whose
charge (as they have alledged) was to keep and defend the Corps of S. <HI>Cuthbert</HI> their great adored
Saint, and therefore they termed themselves, <HI>The holy work folks.</HI> And the repute of this <HI>Cuthbert</HI>
and his supposed defence against the <HI>Scots</HI> was such, that our <HI>English</HI> Kings in great devotion have
gone in Pilgrimage to visite his Tomb, and have given many large possessions to his Church:
such were King <HI>Egfred, Aelfred,</HI> and <HI>Guthrun</HI> the <HI>Dane, Edward</HI> and <HI>Athelstane</HI> Monarch of <HI>England,</HI>
and zealous <HI>Canu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> the greatest of all, who came thither bare-footed, and at <HI>Cuthberts</HI> Tomb both
augmented and confirmed their Liberties. This Saint then, of nothing made <HI>Durham</HI> become great,
and <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> of a <HI>Bishoprick</HI> made it a <HI>County Palatine:</HI> at that time <HI>William Cereceph,</HI>
<PB REF="119">
Bishop of the Diocess, pulled down the old Church which <HI>Aldwin</HI> had built, and with sumptuous cost
laid the foundation of a new, wherein S. <HI>Cuthberts</HI> Shrine in the vacancy of the Bishops, was the Keep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|er

he wrote do well declare: And had the idle Monks of <HI>England</HI> imployed their time after his exam|ple,
their Founders expectations had not been frustrate, nor those Foundations so easily overturn|ed.
But the revenge of sin ever following the actions of sins, dissolved first the largeness of this

<P>(7) Things of rare note observed in this Shire, are three pits of a wonderful depth, commonly cal|led
the <HI>Hell-Kettles,</HI> which are adjoyning neer unto <HI>Darlington,</HI> whose waters are somewhat warm.

a noise, that it made all the neighbour dwellers sore afraid: and the earth swallowed it up, and made
in the same place a deep pit, which is there to be seen for a testimony unto this day.</HI></P>

<P>(2) The length thereof extended from <HI>Burton</HI> in her South, to <HI>Kirkland</HI> in her North part is 30
miles: the broadest part from East to West, is from the River <HI>Eden</HI> to <HI>Dunbal raise stones,</HI> containing
24 miles, the whole circumference about 112 miles.</P>
<P>(3) The form thereof is somewhat long and narrow: the Air sharp and piercing, purging it self
from the trouble of gross foggy mists, and vapours, by reason of which the people of this Province are
not acquainted with strange diseases or imperfections of body, but live long, and are healthful, and
at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ain to the number of many years.</P>
<P>(4) The Soil for the most part of it is but barren, and can hardly be brought to any fruitfulness, by
the industry and painful labour of the husbandman, being so full of infertile places, which the Norteern
<HI>Englishme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> call Moors; yet the more Southerly part is not reported to be so sterile, but more fruitful
in the Vallies, though contained in a narrow room, between the River <HI>Lone,</HI> and <HI>Winander-mear,</HI>

name above them, and hath great vent and Traffique for her Woollen-cloaths through all the parts
of <HI>England.</HI> It challengeth not much glory for Antiquity; only that it accounteth it a great credit,
that it hath dignified three Earls with the title thereof, as <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> whom <HI>Henry</HI> the
Fifth (being his brother) advanced to that honour, <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and <HI>Iohn de Foix,</HI> whom

<P>(8) Places of memorable note for Antiquity are <HI>Vertera,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Antonine</HI> the Empe|rour;
and <HI>Aballaba,</HI> which we contractly call <HI>Apelby.</HI> In the one, the Northern <HI>English</HI> conspired
against <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour</HI> in the beginning of the <HI>Norman</HI> Government. In the other, the
<PB REF="122">
<HI>Aurelian Maures</HI> kept a Station in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and their high-street is yet apparently to be
seen by the ridges thereof, which lead by <HI>Apelby</HI> to a place called <HI>Brovonacum,</HI> mentioned in the Book
of Provincial notices. The antique pieces of <HI>Roman</HI> Coin otherwhiles digged up hereabouts, and
some Inscriptions not long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ince found, shew of what continuance they have been: although Time,
which devoureth all things, hath so fed upon their carkasses many Ages together, as it hath almost
consumed both Houses and Inhabitants, for <HI>Apelby</HI> now is bare both of People and Building; and were
it not for the antiquity that makes it the more estimable, in whose Castle the Assises are commonly
kept, it would be little better in account than a Village. <HI>Verterae</HI> is long since decayed, and the name
of it changed into <HI>Burgh:</HI> for it is commonly named <HI>Burgh</HI> under <HI>Stanemore.</HI> In which, it is said, a
<HI>Roman</HI> Captain made his abode with a Band of <HI>Directores,</HI> in the declining Age of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire-
These two places <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Newborough</HI> calleth Princely Holds, and writeth, that <HI>William</HI> King
of <HI>Scots</HI> a little before he himself was taken Prisoner at <HI>Alnewicke,</HI> surprized them on a sudden, but

<P>(9) There is mention made but of one Religious House that hath been in all this Country, and that
was a little Monastery seated near unto the River <HI>Loder,</HI> built by <HI>Thomas</HI> the son of <HI>Gospatricke,</HI> the
Son of <HI>Orms:</HI> where there is a Fountain or Spring that Ebbs and Flows many times a day, and it is
thought that some notable Act of Atchievement hath been performed there, for that there be huge
Stones in form of Pyramides, some nine foot high, and fourteen foot thick, ranged for a mile in length
directly in a row, and equally distant, which might seem to have been there purposely pitched in me|mory
thereof: but what that Act was it is not now known, but quite worn out of remembrance by
Times injury.</P>
<P>(10) Other matters worthy of observation are only these: That at <HI>Ambogla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> now called <HI>Am|ble</HI>-side,
<PB REF="122">
near the upper-corner of <HI>Winander-Mear,</HI> there appears at this day the ruins of an ancient
City, which by the <HI>British-Bricks,</HI> by <HI>Roman-Money</HI> oftentimes found there, by <HI>High-waies</HI> paved
leading unto it, and other likelihoods, seems to have beed a work of the <HI>Romans:</HI> The Fortress there|of
so long fenced with a Ditch and Rampire, that it took up in length one hundred thirty two Ells,
and in breadth eight. There are also near <HI>Kendale</HI> in the River <HI>Can,</HI> two <HI>Catadupae</HI> or <HI>Waterfalls,</HI>
where the Waters descend with such a forcible downfal, that it compels a mighty noise to be heard,
which the neighbour Inhabitants make such use of, as they stand them in as good stead as Prognosti|cations:
for when that which standeth North from them soundeth more clear, and with a louder ec|cho
in their ears, they certainly look for fair weather to follow&punc; But when that on the South doth the
like, they expect foggy mists and showers of rain.</P>

<P>CUMBERLAND, the furthest North-West Province in this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> confronteth

more East-ward with <HI>Westmerland,</HI> the South with <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and the
West is wholly washed with the <HI>Irish-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form whereof is long and narrow, pointing wedg-like into the South, which part is altoge|ther
pestred with copped hills, and therefore hath the name of <HI>Cop-land.</HI> The middle is more level,
and better inhabited, yielding sufficient for the sustenance of man: but the North is wild and solitary,
cumbred with Hills, as <HI>Copland</HI> is.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is piercing, and of a sharp temperature, and would be more biting, were it not that
those high Hills break off the Northern storms, and cold falling Snows.</P>
<P>(4) Notwithstanding, rich is this Province, and with great varieties thereof is replenished: the
Hills, though rough, yet smile upon their beholders, spread with Sheep and Cattel, the Vallies sto|red
with Grass and Corn sufficient: the Sea affordeth great store of Fish, the Land overspread with
variety of Fowls, and the Rivers feed a kind of Muskle that bringeth forth Pearl, where in the
mouth of the <HI>Irt,</HI> as they lie gaping and sucking in Dew, the Country people gather, and sell to the
<HI>Lapidaries</HI> to their own little, and the buyers great gain. But the <HI>Mines Royal</HI> of <HI>Copper,</HI> whereof
this Country yieldeth much, is for use, the richest of all: the place is at <HI>Keswick</HI> and <HI>Newland,</HI> where
<PB REF="123">
likewise the <HI>Black-Lead</HI> is gotten, whose plenty maketh it of no great esteem; otherwise a commodity
that could hardly be missed.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants known to the <HI>Romans,</HI> were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> whom <HI>Ptolomy</HI> disper|seth
into <HI>Westmorland, Richmond, Durham, York-shire,</HI> and <HI>Lancashire.</HI> But when the <HI>Saxons</HI> had
overborn the <HI>Britains,</HI> and forced them out of the best, to seek their resting among the vast Moun|tains,
these by them were entred into, where they held play with their enemies, maugre their force,
and from them, as <HI>Marianus</HI> doth witness, the Land was called <HI>Cumber,</HI> of those <HI>Kumbri</HI> the <HI>Bri|tains.</HI>
But when the State of the <HI>Saxons</HI> was sore shaken by the <HI>Danes,</HI> this <HI>Cumberland</HI> was accoun|ted
a Kingdom of it self; for so the Flower-gatherer of <HI>Westminster</HI> recordeth: King <HI>Edmund</HI> (saith

of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s of</HI> Dunmail <HI>King of that Province, granted that Kingdom unto</HI> Malcolm <HI>King of</HI> Scots,

<HI>Scots,</HI> what time he stood in most need of aid, confirmed by gift under their Crown; which <HI>Henry</HI> the

Marches of <HI>England:</HI> since when, many bickerings betwixt these Nations herein have hapned, but
none so bitter against the <HI>Scottish</HI>-side, as was that at <HI>Salome Moss,</HI> where their Nobility disdaining
their General <HI>Oliver Sinclere,</HI> gave over the Battel, and yielded themselves to the <HI>English:</HI> which
dishonour pierced so deeply into to the heart of King <HI>Iames</HI> the fifth, that for grief thereof he shortly
after died.</P>
<P>(6) Many memorable Antiquities remain and have been found in this County: for it being
the Confines of the <HI>Romans Possessions,</HI> was continually secured by their <HI>Garrisons,</HI> where remains at

Altars, and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">scriptions of their Captains and Colonies, whereof many have been found, and more as

and by us <HI>Carlile.</HI> This City flourishing under the <HI>Romans,</HI> at their departure, by the furious
outrages of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> was dejected, yet in the daies of <HI>Egfrid</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> was
walled about: but again defaced by the over-running <HI>Danes,</HI> lay buried in her own ashes the space
of two hundred years: upon whose ruines at length <HI>Rufus</HI> set his compassionate eye, and built there
the Castle, planting a Colony of <HI>Flemings</HI> to secure the Coasts from the <HI>Scots,</HI> but upon better advise|ment
removed them into <HI>Wales.</HI> After him, <HI>Henry</HI> his Brother and Successor ordained this City for
an Episcopal See; whose site is placed in the degree of Longitude from the first West part 17 and 2
scruples, and the Pole thence elevated from the degree of Latitude 55 and 56 scruples.</P>
<P>(8) West from hence, at <HI>Burgh</HI> upon the Sand, was the fatal end of our famous Monarch King

missed life, to his untimely and soon lamented death.</P>
<P>(9) And at <HI>Salkelds</HI> upon the River <HI>Eden,</HI> a Monument of seventy seven Stones, each of them ten

These are by the By-dwellers called <HI>Long-Meg and her Daughters.</HI></P>
<P>(10) This Country, as it stood in the Fronts of Assaults, so was it strengthened with twenty-five

<P>THE County of <HI>Northumberla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d,</HI> hath on the South the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> being shut
in with the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> and with <HI>Tyne;</HI> the North is confined upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
West upon part of <HI>Scotland</HI> and part of <HI>Cumberland;</HI> the East-side lyeth altogether upon
the Sea, called <HI>Mare Germanicum:</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is Triangular, and differs not much in the sidings; for from her
South-East unto the South-West point are near unto 40 miles; from thence to her North-point are sixty
miles, and her base along the Sea-shore 45 miles: The whole in circumference is about one hundred
forty five miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air must needs be subtile and piercing, for that the Northernly parts are most exposed to
extremity of weathers, as great winds, hard fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, and long lying of snows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet would it be far
more sharp than it is, were not the <HI>German-S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">as</HI> a ready means to further the dissolution of her Ice
and Snow, and the plenty of Coals there gotten, a great help to comfort the Body with marmth, and
defend it from the bitter coldness.</P>
<P>(4) The soil cannot be rich, having neither fertility of ground for Corn or Cattel, the most part
of it being rough, and in every place hard to be man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">red, save only towards the Sea and the River
<HI>Tyne,</HI> where, by the great diligence and industrious pains of good husbandry, that part is become very
fruitful.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country, mentioned by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> were called OTTALINI,
OTTADENI, and OTTADINI, which by an ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ie alteration (as M. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mbden saith,</HI> if it

had been called OTTATINI, signifying, about the River <HI>Tyne,</HI> or on the further side of <HI>Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> (for so
this People were planted) there would have been much consonance both with the name of the Inhabi|tants,
and the Position and Site of the Province.</P>
<P>(6) The chiefest commodity that enricheth this County, are those Stones <HI>Linthancrates,</HI> which we
call Sea-coals, whereof there is such plenty and abundance digged up, as they do not only return a great
gain to the Inhabitants, but procure also much pleasure and profit to others.</P>
<P>(7) No place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">his Province vents forth so many of these Sea-coals into other Regions, as <HI>New-Castle</HI>
doth, being the very Eye of all the Towns in this County: for it doth not only minister relief
(by such provision) to all other parts of <HI>England,</HI> but doth also furnish the wants of forrain Countries
with her plenty. By means of this and the intercouse of Traffique which it hath, the place is grown
exceeding rich and populous. Before the <HI>Conquest</HI> it was called <HI>Monk-chester:</HI> having been (as it
seemed) in the possession of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">onks:</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> being added, which signifies a Bulwark or place of
defence, and shews that in ancient time it had been a place of Fortification.</P>
<P>(8) After the <HI>Conquest</HI> it got the name of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> by the New Castle which <HI>Robert</HI> the Son of
<HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour</HI> built there, out of the ground. What it was called in old time is not
known, yet some are of opinion, that it may be thought to have been <HI>Gatrosentum,</HI> for that <HI>Gates|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ead,</HI>
the suburb (as it were) of the same, expresseth in their own proper signification that <HI>British</HI>
name, <HI>Gatrosentum.</HI> It is now most ennobled both by the Haven (which <HI>Tyne</HI> maketh) of that not a|ble
depth, that it beareth very tall Ships, and is able to defend them against Storms and Tempests.
As also by many favours and honours wherewith it hath been dignified by Princes: for <HI>Richard</HI> the
Second granted that a Sword should be carried before the Mayor, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixt made it a Coun|ty
consisting of a Corporation within it self. It is adorned with four Churches, and fortified with
strong Walls that have eight gates. It is distant from the first West line 21 degrees and 30 minutes
<PB REF="126">
and from the Equinoctial-line towards the North-Pole thirty four degrees and fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y-seven mi|nutes.</P>
<P>(9) The utmost Town in <HI>England,</HI> and the strongest Hold in all <HI>Britain,</HI> is <HI>Barwick.</HI> From
whence it had the name is not certainly made known. Some fetch it from <HI>Berengarius,</HI> a Duke (never
read of:) Howsoever, this is better to be said than trusted: and whencesoever it hath the name, it
is seated between two mighty Kingdoms, shooting far into the Sea, with the which and the
River <HI>Tweed,</HI> it is almost encompassed: and whensoever any discord fell between the two Nations,
this place was the first thing they took care of. It hath endured the brunts of divers inroads and in|cursions,
and been oftentimes possessed and repossessed of the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ots</HI> and <HI>English:</HI> But since it was
reduced under the command of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, our Kings have from time to time so strength|ned
it with new Works and Fortifications, as they cut off all hopes of winning it. The Gover|nour
of this Town is also Warden of the East-Marches against <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Longitude of it ac|cording
to Mathematical observation, is 21 degrees and 43 minutes: the Latitude 55 degrees and
48 minutes.</P>
<P>(10) The Inhabitants of this Country are a warlike People, and excellent Horsemen, and ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
made fierce and hard by the several encounters of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and not much unlike them in neither,
betwixt whom in this County, many Battels have been fought, and the successes oftentimes waved
through very doubtfully, the Victory sometimes falling to the <HI>Scots,</HI> sometimes to the <HI>English.</HI> At
<HI>Otterburne</HI> was one, in which three or four times it stood doubtfully indifferent, till in the end the
<HI>Scots</HI> got the upperhand of the <HI>English:</HI> Howbeit, their glory was not made so illustrious by this
Conquest, but that it was as much darkned by the foil they received at <HI>Anwicke,</HI> where <HI>William.</HI>
King of <HI>Scots</HI> was taken and presented Prisoner to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second. As also by that Battel at <HI>Brum|ridge,</HI> Where King <HI>Athelstan</HI> fought a pitcht field against <HI>Anlafe</HI> the <HI>Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, Constantine</HI> King of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,

King of <HI>Scots,</HI> who was there slain, and his Army overthrown in a sharp Fight, as he displayed his
Banner (in great hope) against <HI>England,</HI> when King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight lay at the siege of <HI>Turnay</HI> in
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>(11) Other Battels in this County have been, as that at <HI>Hexam</HI> (called by <HI>Beda, Hangust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ld</HI>)
wherein <HI>Iohn Nevil, Marquess M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ntacute,</HI> encountred the Leaders of the <HI>Lancastrian</HI> Faction with
much courage, and with greater success, put them to flight, for which he was made Earl of <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI> by <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth. As also that of <HI>Dilston,</HI> (by <HI>Beda</HI> called <HI>Devilshurne</HI>) where
<HI>Oswald</HI> having the Faith of Christ for his Defence and Armour, slew <HI>Cedwall</HI> the <HI>Britain</HI> in a set Battel
himself straightwaies becoming a professed Christian, and causing his people to be instructed in Chri|stain
Religion.</P>
<P>(12) Many memorable Antiquities are found in this Country along the Wall, and in other places:
As pieces of Coin, Inscriptions, broken and unperfect Altars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the ruines of the Wall yet to be seen:
but none that deserves more to be remembred than <HI>Wall-Town</HI> (by <HI>Beda</HI> called <HI>Ad Murum</HI>) for that
<HI>Segebert</HI> King of the <HI>East-Saxons</HI> was in it baptized in the Christian Faith by the hands of <HI>Paulinus:</HI>
and <HI>Halyston,</HI> where the said <HI>Paulinus</HI> is said to have baptized many thousands into the Faith of Christ
in the Primitive Church of the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>(13) <HI>Busy-gap</HI> is a place infamous for robbing and thieving, and is therefore rather remembred as
a cautionary note for such as have cause to travel that way, than for any proper matter of worth it hath,
that merits place with other parts of this Province.</P>
<P>Other matters of observation are only these, that <HI>North-Tyne</HI> (running thorow the <HI>Wall</HI>)
waters two Dales, which breed notable light-horse-men, and both of them have their hills<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> (hard by)
<PB REF="127">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o boggy, and standing with water on the top, that no horse-men are able to ride through them, and
yet (which is wonderful) there be many great heaps of Stones (called <HI>Laws</HI>) which the neighbouring
people are verily perswaded were cast up and laid together in old time, in remembrance of some that
were slain there. There is also a martial kind of Men which lie out, up and down in little Cottages
(called by them <HI>Sheals</HI> and <HI>Shealings</HI>) from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>August,</HI> in scattering fashion, summering (as they

year of Christ 1215, in the spight they bare to King <HI>Iohn,</HI> for that he and his <HI>Rutars</HI> over-ran these
Countries.</P>
<P>This County hath five Market-Towns in it for her Trade of Buying and Selling, 26 Castles for her

<P>(6) The Inhabitants of this Island are for the most part religious, and loving to their Pastors, to
whom they do much reverence and respect, frequenting daily to Divine Service, without division in the

This Isle prohibits the customary manner of begging from dore to dore, detesting the disorders,
as well <HI>Civil</HI> as Ecclesiastical of Neighbour Nations. And the last, not least, that deserves to be com|mitted

<P>ANno Dom. 1065 <HI>Edward,</HI> of blessed memory, King of <HI>England,</HI> departed this life, and
<HI>Harald</HI> the Son of <HI>Godwin</HI> succeeded him in the Kingdom: against whom <HI>Harold
Harfager</HI> (King of <HI>Norway</HI>) came into the Field, and fought a Battel at <HI>Stainford|bridge:</HI>
but the <HI>English</HI> obtaining the Victory put them all to flight. Out of which

the Son of <HI>Syrric,</HI> who raigned then in <HI>Man,</HI> and honourably received him.</P>
<P>(2) The same year <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Bastard</HI> conquered <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Godred</HI> the Son of <HI>Syrric</HI> died, his
Son <HI>Fingal</HI> succeeding him.</P>
<P><PB REF="130">(3) An. 1066. <HI>Godred Crovan</HI> assembled a great Fleet, and came to <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and fought with the
people of the Land, but received the worst, and was overcome.</P>
<P>The second time renewing his Forces and his Fleet, he sailed into <HI>Man,</HI> and joyned Battel with the
<HI>Manksmen</HI> but was vanquished as before, and driven out of the Field. Howbeit, what he could not
at first bring to pass with power in those two several onsets, he afterward effected by policy. For the
third time gathering a great multitude together, he arrived by night in the haven called <HI>Ramsey,</HI> and
hid three hundred men in a Wood, which stood upon the hanging hollow brow of an Hill called <HI>Scea|full.</HI>
The Sun being risen, the <HI>Manksmen</HI> put their People in order of Battel, and with a violent
charge encountred with <HI>Godred.</HI> The fight was hot for a time, and stood in a doubtful suspence till
those three hundred Men starting out of the Ambush behind their backs, began to foil the <HI>Manksmen,</HI>
put them to the worst, and forced them to flie. Who seeing themselves thus discomfited, and finding

besought him not to put the Sword such poor remainder of them as was left alive. <HI>Godred</HI> having
compassion on their calamities, (for he had been pursed for a time and brought up among them) sound|ed
a Retreat, and prohibited his Host any longer pursuit. He being thus possessed of the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI>
died in the Island that is called <HI>Isle,</HI> when he had raigned sixteen years. he left behind him three sons
<HI>Lagman, Harald,</HI> and <HI>Olave.</HI></P>
<P>(4) <HI>Lagman</HI> the eldest, taking upon him the Kingdom, raigned seven year. His brother <HI>Harald</HI> re|belled

of generation to be cut off, and his eyes to be put out of his head: which curelty this <HI>Lagman</HI> af|terwards
repenting, gave over the Kingdom of his own accord, and wearing the Badge of the Lords
Cross, took a journey to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> in which he died.</P>
<P>(5) An. 1075. All the Lords and Nobles of the Islands hearing of the death of <HI>Lagman,</HI> dispatched

The King yielding to their request, sent one <HI>Dopnald</HI> the son of <HI>Tade,</HI> and charged him to govern the
Kingdom (which by right belonged to another) with lenity and gentleness. But after he was come
to the Crown, forgetting or not weighing the charge that his Lord and Master had given him, swayed
his place with great Tyranny, committing many outrages and cruelties, and so raigned three years: till
all the Princes of the Islands agreeing together, rose up against him, and made him flie into <HI>Ire|land.</HI></P>
<P>(6) An. Dom. 1111. <HI>Olave</HI> the son of <HI>Godred Craven</HI> aforesaid, began his Raign, and raigned for|ty

<P>(7) An. Dom. 1144. <HI>Godred</HI> the son of <HI>Olave,</HI> was created King of <HI>Man,</HI> and raigned thirty

the rest all put to flight, These Atchievements made, <HI>Godred</HI> returned to <HI>Man,</HI> and began to use
Tyranny, turning the Noblemen out of their Inheritances. Whereupon one called <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rsin (Otters</HI>

of the Islands: whereof <HI>Godred</HI> having intelligence, prepared a Navy of 80 Ships to meet <HI>Sum|merled.</HI>
And in the year 1156 there was a Battle fought at Sea on Twelfth day at night, and
many slain on both sides. But the next day they grew to a pacification, and divided the Kingdom
<PB REF="131">
of the Islands among themselves. This was the cause of the overthrow of the Kingdom of
the Isles.</P>
<P>(8) An. 1158. <HI>Summerled</HI> came to <HI>Man,</HI> with a Fleet of fifty three Sail, put <HI>Godred</HI> to flight, and
wasted the Island. <HI>Godred</HI> upon this crossed over to <HI>Norway</HI> for aid against <HI>Summerled.</HI> But <HI>Summer|led</HI>
in the mean time arriving at <HI>Rhinfrin,</HI> and having gathered together a Fleet of 160 Ships, coveting
to subdue all <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the just Iudgment of God, was vanquished by a few, and both himself and
his son slain, with an infinite number of people.</P>
<P>(9) The fourth day after, <HI>Raignald</HI> began to raign, but <HI>Godred</HI> coming upon him out of <HI>Norway</HI>
with a great number of Armed Men, took his Brother <HI>Raignald,</HI> and bereft him both of his Eyes and
Genital Members. On the fourth Ides of <HI>November,</HI> An. Dom. 1187. <HI>Godred</HI> King of the Islands
died, and his body was translated to the <HI>Isle of Ely.</HI> He left behind him three sons, <HI>Raignald, Olave,</HI>
and <HI>Tvar.</HI> He ordained in his life time that <HI>Olave</HI> should succeed him, because he only was born legi|timate.
But the people of <HI>Man</HI> seeing him to be scarce ten years old, sent for <HI>Raignald,</HI> and made
him their King. This caused great division, and many turbulent attempts between the two Brethren
for the space of thirty eight years; which had no end, till at a place called <HI>Tingualla</HI> there was a Bat|tel
struck between them, wherein <HI>Olave</HI> had the Victory, and <HI>Raignald</HI> was slain. The Monks of
<HI>Russin</HI> translated his Body unto the Abbey of S. <HI>Mary de Fournes,</HI> and there interred it in a place which
himself had chosen for that purpose.</P>
<P>(10) An. 1230. <HI>Olave</HI> and <HI>Godred Don</HI> (who was <HI>Raignalds</HI> son) with the <HI>Norwegiaus</HI> came to

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLV.</HEAD>
<P>THis Island is called <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> by the River <HI>Lied</HI> that is opposite unto it on the Coast of
<HI>Northumberland. Beda</HI> termed it a <HI>Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-Island.</HI> The <HI>Britains</HI> name it <HI>Iuis Medicante,</HI>
for that it twice every day suffereth an exordinary inundation and over-flowing of the
Ocean in manner of an Island, which twice likewise makes it continent to the Land,
and returning unto her watry habitation, lays the Shore bare again, as before. It is
called in English, <HI>Holy-Island,</HI> for that in ancient times many <HI>Monks</HI> have been accustomed to retired
themselves thither, and to make it their receptacle for solitude: having on the West and South, <HI>Nor|thumberland,</HI>
and more South Eastward the Island <HI>Farne.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form of it is long and narrow, the West-side narrower than the East, and are both con|joyned
by a very small spang of Land that is left unto Conies. The South is much broader than the
rest. It is from East to West, about two thousand two hundred and fifty paces: and from North to
South, twelve hundred and fifty paces; so that the circumference cannot be great.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is not very good either for health or delight, as being seated on those parts that are
subject to extremity of cold, and greatly troubled with vapou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s and foggy mists that arise from the
Seas.</P>
<P>(4) The Soil cannot be rich, being rocky and full of Stones, and unfit for Corn and Tillage.
It is neither commended for Hills to feed Sheep, nor Pastures to fat Cattel; neither hath it Vallies
replenished with sweet Springs, or running Rivolets, only one excepted, descending from a standing
Pond. The only thing this Island yieldeth, is a fit and accommodate aptitude for Fishing and Fowling.</P>
<P><PB REF="134">(5) Notwithstanding, this is very worthy of note concerning the same, which <HI>Alcun</HI> wrote in an
Epistle to <HI>Egelred</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> namely, that it was a place more venerable than all the
places of <HI>Britain,</HI> and that after the departure of S. <HI>Paulinus</HI> from <HI>York,</HI> there Christian Religion be|gan
in their Nation, though afterwards it there felt the first beginning of misery and calamity, being
left to the spoil of Pagans and Miscreants.</P>
<P>(6) It is also remembred of this Island, that sometime there hath been in it an Episcopal See, which
<HI>Aidan</HI> the <HI>Scot</HI> instituted (being called thither to Preach the Christian Faith to the People of <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI>)
being thus delighted with the solitary situation thereof, as a most fit place for retire|ment.
But afterwards when the <HI>Danes</HI> rifled all the Sea-Coasts, the Episcopal See was translated to
<HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>(7) This Island so small in account either for compass or commodity, and so unpeopled and un|profitable,
cannot be numerous in Towns and Villages. It hath in it only one Town, with a Church
and a Castle, under which there is a commodious Haven, defended with a Block-house, situate upon
an Hill towards the South-East.</P>

miles from <HI>Brambrough</HI> Castle. On the West and South it beareth upon <HI>Northumber|land,</HI>
and on the North-east-side it hath other smaller Islands adjoyning to it, as <HI>Wido|pons</HI>
and <HI>Staple-Island,</HI> which lie two miles off <HI>Bronsinan,</HI> and two lesser than these,
which are called the <HI>Wambes.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="134">(2) The Form of this I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">le is round, and no longer in compass than may easily be ridden in one half
of a day. The breadth of it is but five miles&punc; and the length no more. The whole circumference ex|tends
it self no further than to fifteen miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is very unwholsom, and subject both to many <HI>Dysenteries</HI> and other Diseases, by rea|son
of the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ty Fogs and Exhalations that are thereunto drawn up from the Ocean. It is many times
troubled with unusual Tempests of Winds, with boisterous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ury of stormy Rains, and with several and
uncouth rages of the Sea.</P>
<P>(4) The Soil cannot be fertile, being incircled about with craggy Clifts; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">either hath it in it much
matter either of pleasure or profit. It can neither defend it self from Cold, lacking Fuel, as Wood,
Coal, Turffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor from Famine, wanting Food, as Corn, Pastures, Cattel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The best Com|modity
it yields, is Fish and Fowl.</P>
<P>(5) This thing nevertheless is worthy to be remembred of it, which <HI>Beda</HI> (writing of the Life of
<HI>Cuthbert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> that <HI>Tutelar Patron</HI> of the <HI>Northern E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">glishmen</HI>) reporteth, namely,
that in this Isle he built a City fitting his Government, and erected certain Houses in the same; the
whole building standing almost round in compass, and reaching the space of four or five Pearches. The
Wall about it, he made higher than a Mans height, to with-hold and keep in the wanton lasciviousness
both of his thoughts and eyes, and to elevate the whole intention of his mind up to heavenly desires,
that he might wholly give himself to the service of God. But these are all made the ruins of time, as
sithence many other Monuments have been of worthy Antiquity.</P>
<P>(6) I cannot report that there are now many Houses standing in it, much less Towns or Villages:
Only this, that it hath a Tower or Place of Fortification belonging unto it, placed well-neer in the
middle part of the Isle.</P>

<P>(2) This Isle in form and fashion standeth in the Sea, much like to a Park that is encompassed
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ound about with a Pale of Rocks, being very defensible unto the Island from the attempting invasion
of Enemies.</P>
<P>(3) The Air and Climate of this Isle hath little or no difference in temper or quality from that of
<HI>Iersey.</HI> And this deserves to be remembred of it; that in this Isle is neither Toad, Snake, Adder, or
any other venemous creature, and the other hath great plenty.</P>
<P>(4) It standeth for the most part upon a Rock, very high in many places from the Sea. Neverthe|less
the Soil is very fruitful, yielding forth great plenty of Grass for their Sheep and other Cattel, which
they have to serve all uses. Their Fields in the Summer time are so naturally ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nished with Flowers
of all sorts, that a man (being there) might conceit himself to be in a pleasant artificial Garden.</P>
<P>(5) The Inhabitants are not so much given to Tillage as they of <HI>Iersey,</HI> though the Soil be as

<P>(6) In this Isle are many great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">teep Rocks, among which is found a hard stone called by the

<P>(7) It hath a head of Land upon the North part thereof, the passage into which is so narrow, that
a man would think that at every Tyde (the Sea beating strongly on both sides) it were in a continual
danger to be fundred from the other part of the Isle. This place is called S. <HI>Mic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">l in the Vale,</HI>

<P>THe two Islands <HI>Iersey</HI> and <HI>Garnsey,</HI> being the only remains of the Dukedom of <HI>Normandy;</HI>
that in former times many years together was in the possession, and under the command
of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> annexing thereunto a large Territory and glorious Title to the
Crown, are both seated in the Sea called <HI>Mare Britannicum,</HI> the Ocean parting them a
good distance asunder, and are now both adjuncts, and within the circuit of <HI>Hampshire.</HI>
For the first (being the Isle of <HI>Iersey</HI>) it lieth upon the <HI>British-Sea,</HI> having on the North parts the Coasts
of <HI>Hampshire,</HI> and on the South the Country of <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Island is long, not much unlike the fashion of an Egg. It contains in length from <HI>Sent|w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n-Poole</HI>
upon the West, to <HI>Mount-Orguil</HI> Castle on the East, ten miles, and in breadth from <HI>Dubon|point</HI>
to <HI>Plymoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">-bay,</HI> six miles: the whole circuit of the Island being thirty eight miles. It is distant
from a little Island ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ed <HI>Alderney,</HI> about four leagues. It was in old time called <HI>Caesaria;</HI> whether
from <HI>Iulius Octavius,</HI> or any the other <HI>Caesars</HI> that followed, is unknown. But the <HI>Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">chmen</HI> have by
corruption of speech long time called it <HI>Iersey.</HI></P>
<P>(3) It is a very pleasant and delightful Island, and giveth a pleasant aspect unto the Seas. It lyeth
Southward not far from a craggy ridge of Rocks, which is much feared of the Mariners, and makes the
passage that way very dangerous, howbeit it serves for a forcible defence against Pirats, or any stranger
that attempts invasion, and they are termed <HI>Casquets.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Soil is very fertile, bringing forth store of Corn and Cattel, but especially
of Sheep, that are of reasonable bigness, the most of them bearing four horns apiece: Their
Wooll very fine and white, of which the Inhabitants make their <HI>Iersey</HI> Stockings, which
<PB REF="136">
are ordinarily to be had in most parts of <HI>England,</HI> and yield a great commodity unto the Island.</P>
<P>(5) The first original of the Inhabitants sprung either from the <HI>Normans</HI> or <HI>Britains,</HI> or both. They
speak <HI>French,</HI> though after a corrupt manner, and have continued their Names, Language, Customs,
and Country, without any, or little intermix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ure, these many hundred years, having been under the
jurisdiction of the <HI>English</HI> ever since the untimely and unnatural death of <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI>
eldest son to <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour.</P>
<P>(6) The People of this Country live very pleasantly, as well by the profits of the Land, as the
helps and furtherances of the Sea, that yields unto them (and especially in Summer season) great store
of Fish but principally for Conger and Lobsters, the greatest and fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">est upon the Coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t of <HI>England.</HI>
Wood is very scant, for their best Fuel is Turff, some Coal they have brought unto them, but it is very
dear; Straw, Furrs's, and Fern serving their ordinary uses. The middle part of the Island hath many
pretty Hills rising in it, yielding a delightful object unto the Vallies, that receive from one another a
mutual pleasure.</P>
<P>(7) The Governour of this I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">le is the Captain thereof, who appointeth certain Officers under him:
the principal of whom, carrieth the name and title of a Bailif, that in civil causes hath the assistance of
twelve Iurats to determine of differences, and minister Iustice: in criminal matters seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">: in matters
of reason and conscience, five. Their Twelve are chosen out of the twelve Parishes; so that no man
goeth further to complain, than to his own Iurate in ordinary Controversies: but matters of moment
and difficulty are determined before the Baili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> in a General Meeting.</P>
<P>(8) This Isle hath two little Islands adjacent; the one S. <HI>Albous,</HI> the other <HI>Hillary Island.</HI> It hath
twelve Parishes, and four Castles. No other Monuments of Name or Note.</P>

<P>(4) The Soil is hungry, though not barren, and that in the East and South the best: the other parts

<P>(6) Places most worthy of note in this Shire, are as ensueth; The first is <HI>Radnor,</HI> from whom the
County receiveth her name anciently <HI>Magi,</HI> where the Commander of the <HI>Pacensian Regiment</HI> lay,
and thought to be the <HI>Magnos</HI> in <HI>Antonine</HI> the Emperours Survey. This Town is pleasantly seated un|der
a Hill, whereon standeth mounted a large and strong Castle, from whose Bulwark a Trench is
drawn along the West of the Town, whereon a Wall of Stone was once raised, as by the remains in ma|ny
places appeareth. This Trench doth likewise inverge her West-side so far as the River, but after is
no more seen: whose Graduation is observed to have the Pole elevated for Latitude 52 degrees, and
45 minutes; and for Longitude, from the first Point of the West set by <HI>Mercator</HI> 17 degrees and one
minute.</P>
<P><HI>Prestayn</HI> for beautious building is the best in this Shire, a Town of Commerce, wonderfully fre|quented, and that very lately. Next is <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ighton,</HI> a Market-Town likewise, under which is seen

<P>(3) This County is full of Hills, and uneven for travel, which on the South part mount in such height
that as <HI>Giraldus</HI> hath written, <HI>They make the Air much colder, and defend the Country from the excessive

the site of that Town, the Aldermen or chief Seniors thereof regarding my pains with friendly
and courteous entertainments, at my departure, no less than eight of them, that had been Bailiffs of
the Town, came to visite me; where they reported upon their Credit and Trials, that from the top of
that Hill, in the <HI>Welsh</HI> called <HI>Mounch-denny,</HI> or <HI>Cadier Arthur,</HI> they had oftentimes cast from them&punc;
and down the North-East Rock, their Cloaks, Hats, and Staves, which notwithstanding would ne|ver
fall, but were with the Air and Wind still returned back, and blown up: neither, said they, will
any thing descend from that Cliffe being so cast, unless it be stone or some Metalline substance: affirm|ing
the cause to be the Clouds, which are seen to rack much lower than the top of that Hill. As
strange Tales are told of the <HI>Mear Llynsavathan,</HI> two miles by East from <HI>Brecknock,</HI> which at the break|ing
of her frozen Ice, maketh a fearful sound like unto Thunder. In which place, as is reported, some|times

this <HI>Mear</HI> without any mixture of her waters, as by the colour thereof is well perceived, which
glideth through it with the same stream, and no greater than wherewith she first entred in.</P>
<P>(5) The Towns for Commerce, are <HI>Hay, Bealt,</HI> and <HI>Brecknock,</HI> two of them unfortunate of their

the South, with a Bay of the <HI>British-Seas;</HI> and upon the West with <HI>Pembroke-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form of this County is long, and shooteth it self from the South-West into
the North and by East, betwixt whose further bounds are thirty five <HI>English</HI> miles, and in
her broadest part twenty miles; the whole in circumference about one hundred and two miles.</P>
<P>(3) This Shire is not altogether so pestred with Hills as her bordering Neighbors are: and those
that she hath, neither so high nor so thick, and therefore is better for Corn and Pasturage, yea and in
Woods also, so that for Victuals this County is very well stored, which the Stomach doth as well digest,
the Air being wholsome, temperate, and pleasing.</P>
<P>(4) Anciently these parts were possessed by the <HI>Dimetree,</HI> as <HI>Ptolomy, Gildas,</HI> and <HI>Ninius</HI> do name
them: though <HI>Pliny</HI> holds opinion that they were part of the <HI>Silures,</HI> with whom no doubt they
were subdued to the <HI>Romans</HI> yoke by <HI>Iulius Frontinus,</HI> when he struggled with the Rocky Hills in those
Southern parts. And this County is accounted by Writers to be the very strength of <HI>South-Wales.</HI>
In the West thereof, at <HI>Kilmanlloid</HI> (as it should seem) their Legions were kept, where lately an earth|en

<P>(5) The Commodities of this Shire chiefly consist in <HI>Cattel, Pit-coal, Fowl,</HI> and <HI>Sea-Fish,</HI> whereof
the <HI>Salmon</HI> is common among them, and that of such greatness and plenty, as no place is better furni|shed

<P>(6) Which Town by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> is called <HI>Maridunum;</HI> by <HI>Antonin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the Emperour, <HI>Muridunum;</HI> by

of the River <HI>Tovy,</HI> that runneth through the midst of this Shire, and falleth South from hence into
the <HI>British Sea,</HI> where before-times was a convenient Haven for Ships arrivage, but now is sore pe|stred
with Sands and Shelves&punc; notwithstanding some small Vessels ascend up the River, even unto
the Bridge of this Town, which is fairly built of Free-stone. And over the same, upon a hanging
Rock, standeth a very large Castle, from whose Stone-wall another intermingled with Brick rangeth
about the Town, being in circuit one thousand and four hundred paces. The Inhabitants of
this place do not a little glory of their <HI>Merlin,</HI> who (as they say) was therein born the Son of a

<P>At the entrance of the <HI>Normans</HI> this Town was brought under their obedience, and for a long

<P>(2) The form of this Shire groweth still wider from her West-point, spreading her broadest touch
in the East, betwixt which extreams I find by measure to be well-near forty <HI>English</HI> miles, and from
North to South, not altogether twenty miles: the whole in circumference, about one hundred and
twelve miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is temperate, and gives more content to the mind, than the Soil doth fruit or ease unto
Travellers. The Hills being high and very many, which from the North notwithstanding are lessened
as it were by degrees; and towards the Sea-coasts, the Countrey becometh somewhat plain, which part
is the best, both for plenty of Grain, and populous of Inhabitants. The rest all Mountain, is repleni|shed
with Cattel, which is the best means unto wealth that this Shire doth afford; upon whose Hills you
may behold whole Heards of them feeding; and from whose Rocks most clear springing waters thorow
the Vallies trickling, which sportingly do pass with a most pleasant sound, and did not a little revive
my wearied spirits among those vast Mountains, imployed in their search: whose infancy at first ad|mitted
an easie step over; but grown unto strength, more boldly forbad me such passage, and with a

<P><PB REF="150">(4) Upon whose fall, and East-bank, the fairest Town of all <HI>South-Wales</HI> is seated, the <HI>Britains
Caerdid,</HI> the <HI>English Caerdiffe,</HI> which <HI>Fitz-Haimon</HI> fortified with a Wall and Castle, in the Reign of
King <HI>Rufus,</HI> when he and his <HI>Norman-Knights</HI> had overcome <HI>Rhese</HI> the Prince of these parts, and
thrust out <HI>Iustine</HI> from his lawful possession. This Town he made his own Seat and Court of Iustice,
enjoyning his Consorts to give Aid to this honour, and to hold their Portions in Vassallage of him.
Strong was the Castle, as by the trust therein reposed may well appear, where the youngest brother
<HI>Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">clark</HI> kept Captive the eldest <HI>Curthose,</HI> both of them Sons to the Conquerour, the space of twenty
six years. This Castle is large, and in good repair, whence the Town-Wall went both South and
East to the Rivers side, thorow which, four Gates enter into the four Winds, and contain in com|pass
nine hundred and twenty paces; and along the River (a sure defence) upon her West-side, three
hundred more; so that the Town containeth in circuit twelve hundred and fourscore paces. But as
the <HI>Tave</HI> is a friend to the Town, in making a Key for arrivage of shipping; so is she a foe to S. <HI>Ma|ries</HI>
Church in the South, with undermining her Foundations, and threatning her fall. The Town is
governed by a Mayor, yearly elected out of twelve Aldermen, assisted with other twelve Burgesses, a
Town-Clerk, four Constables, and two Sergeants with Maces: whose site is observed from the
North-Star to lie in the degree of Latitude 51 and 49 scruples, and from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">irst point in the West,

<P>(6) <HI>But things of strange Note are these, by the report of</HI> Giraldus, <HI>who affirmeth that</HI> in a Rock or
Cliffe upon the Sea-side, and Island <HI>Barry,</HI> lying near the South-East point of this County, is heard out of

tossed to and fro in the Womb or concavity thereof, there is heard above, a sound of Cymbals: for the Wind
being driven back from his hole, is forced to make a loud sound as her vent.</P>
<P>(7) More Westward from hence, upon the River <HI>Ogmore,</HI> and neer unto <HI>Newton,</HI> in a sandy

brought to the will of the <HI>English</HI> before the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first. Those ORDOVICES
inhabited the Counties of <HI>Mountgomery, Merioneth, Caernarvan, Denbigh,</HI> and <HI>Flint,</HI> which are of us
called now <HI>North-Wales,</HI> a people generous and of affable conditions, goodly for feature, fair of com|plexion,
couragious of mind, courteous to strangers, and that which is most commendable, most true
and loyal to the <HI>English</HI> Crown.</P>
<P>Towns for Trades and Commerce in this County are six: the chiefest thereof and Shire-Town
is <HI>Mountgomery,</HI> very wholsome for Air, and pleasant for situation, upon an easie ascent of an Hill,
and upon another far higher mounted, stands a fair and well-repaired Castle, from the East-Rock

beateth against her Banks, that it is thought and said, some quantity of the Land hath
been swallowed up by those Seas.</P>
<P>(2) In form this Shire somewhat resembleth a <HI>Welsh-Harp,</HI> though small is the Musick that to her
Inhabitants she makes, being the roughest, and most unpleasant to see to (as <HI>Giraldus</HI> their own <HI>Histo|rian</HI>
writeth) in all <HI>Wales.</HI> The Air for great pleasure, nor Soil for great profit, I cannot greatly
commend, unless it be for the many and mighty great winds, that for the most part therein do rage,
and the spired Hills clustred together so near and so high, as the same <HI>Author</HI> affirmeth, that Shep|herds
upon their tops falling at odds in the morning and challenging the Field for fight, before they
can come together to try out the quarrel, the day will be spent, and the heat of their fury shut up with

<PB REF="156">
of the Soil and Rocks so near the face of the Earth, the Plough cannot be drawn, nor the Corn
prosper, which some have imputed to the idleness of the Inhabitants, wherein they have been greatly
wronged.</P>
<P>(4) These People are a part of the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> of whom we have spoken, who by the advantage of
these Mountains held out with the longest against the <HI>Romans,</HI> and their Necks not brought under the

Rebellion and Confederacy with all other his Rebels, drawing the <HI>Welsh-men</HI> wholly to his side, in hope
to have had Princes restored of their own blood: and he maintained the same with wonderful pride,
policy, and obstinacy for a long time, until his Confederates, Followers and Favorites, and his own

for very want of Food.</P>
<P>(5) Their Towns are not many, neither those that they have of any stately Buildings, whereof

L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">integid,</HI> in <HI>English, Pimble-mear,</HI> a great Pool of Water doth drown at least threescore Acres
of ground: whose nature is, as the report doth pass, that the High-land Floods, though never so great,
cannot make her swell bigger by their receits&punc; but if the Air be troubled with over great blasts

also standeth a most strong and beautiful Castle, mounted upon a Hill, and with a double Bulwark
walled about, commanding the Sea, and passage of entrance of such as seek to invade the Coast: and

and <HI>Shropshire;</HI> and on the South, <HI>Mountgomery shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is long, growing wider still towards the North-West, and narrower towards
the East. It is in length from East to West, one and thirty miles; and in breadth from North to South,
seventeen miles: in the whole circuit and circumference, one hundred and fourteen miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is very wholsome and pleasant, yet bleak-enough, as exposed to the winds on all sides,
and the high Hills, wherewith it is in many places environed, long retaining the congealed Snow. The
tops whereof, in the Summer time, are the Harvest-Mens Almanacks, by the rising of certain Vapours
thereon in the Mornings, and foreshew a fair Day ensuing.</P>
<P>(4) The Soil is but barren towards the West-part: yet the middle, where it lieth flat in a Valley,
is most fertile. The East-side, when it is once past the Valley, findeth Nature to be a very sparing nig|gard
of her favours: but next unto <HI>Dee</HI> it feeleth a more liberal extent of her blessings. The West
part is but here and there inhabited, and mounteth up more than the other with bare and hungry
Hills; yet the leanness of the Soil (where the Hills settle any thing flatting) hath been now a
good while begun to b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> overcome by the diligent pains and careful industry of the Husbandmen;
<PB REF="158">
for they parting away the upper Coat of the Earth into certain Turffs, with a broad kind of Spade, pile
them up artificially on heaps, and fire them, so as being turned into Ashes, and thrown upon the ground
so pared, they fructifie the hungry barrenness and sterility of Soil, and make the Fields bring forth a
kind of <HI>Rie</HI> or <HI>Amell-Corn,</HI> in such plenty, as is hardly to be believed.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">vices,</HI> who being also named <HI>Ordevices,</HI>
or <HI>Ordovicae:</HI> a puissant and couragious People, by reason they kept wholly in a mountainous place,
and took heart even of the Soil it self: for they continued longest free from the Yoke both of <HI>Roman,</HI>
and also of <HI>English</HI> dominion. They were not subdued by the <HI>Romans,</HI> before the dayes of the Empe|rour
<HI>Domitian</HI> (for then <HI>Iulius Agricol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> conquered almost the whole Nation) nor brought under the
command of the <HI>English,</HI> before the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First; but lived a long time in a law|less
kind of liberty, as bearing themselves bold upon their own magnanimity, and the strength of the
Country.</P>
<P>(6) The Mountains of this County yield sufficiency of Neat, Sheep, and Goats. The Valleys in
most places are very plenteous of Corn, especially Eastward on this side, betwixt the Rivers of <HI>Alen</HI> and
<HI>Dee;</HI> But the most Westerly part is Heathy, and altogether barren. The heart of the Shire shews it self
beneath the Hills, in a beautiful and pleasant Vale, reaching seventeen miles in length from South to
North, and five miles, or thereabouts, in breadth, and lieth open only toward the Sea. It is environed
on every side with high Hills, amongst which, the highest is <HI>Moillenly,</HI> on the top whereof is a warlike
Fence with Trench and Rampier, and a little Fountain of clear Water. From these Hills the River
<HI>Cluyd</HI> resorts unto this Vale, and from the very Spring-head (increased with Becks and Brooks) doth
part it in twain, running through the midst of it; whereof in ancient time it was named <HI>Strat-Cluyd:</HI>

<P><PB REF="159">This thing is worthy observation, as a matter memorable, both for admiration and antiquity, that in

it with a Wall about, nor large in circuit, but very strong, and on the South-side with a fair Castle,
strengthned with many high Towers. But he gave it over, and left the work unfinished, conceiving
grief (as a sorrowful Father) that his only Son came to untimely death, and was downed in the Well

Roles so causing it, which for the good of these three Shires, I earnestly sought to have supplied from
the <HI>Nomina Villarum,</HI> in their Sheriffs Books, and had promise of them that might easily have procured
the same. But whether a fearless jealousie possessed their spirits, lest the riches of these Shires, by revealing
such particulars&punc; should be further sought into, I cannot say: yet this I have observed in all my Survey,

<P>FLINT-SHIRE, stretching out in length, broad at one end, and narrow at another, is not

and <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> South-East in distance some four miles. It borders East-ward with part of

parteth <HI>Worrall</HI> and <HI>Flint-shire,</HI> till you come to a little Island called <HI>Hellebree.</HI> Northward
it is bounded with the <HI>Virginian-Sea:</HI> on the West, a little River, called <HI>Cluyd,</HI> parteth her and <HI>Den|bighshire</HI>
asunder: and on the South altogether by <HI>Shrop-shire.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Country is nothing mountainous, as other parts of <HI>Wales</HI> are, but rising gently all along
the River <HI>Dee,</HI> makes a fair shew and prospect of her self to every eye that beholds her, as well upon the
River, being in most places thereabouts four or five miles broad, as upon the other side thereof, being a
part of <HI>Cheshire,</HI></P>
<P>(3) The Air is healthful and temperate, without any foggy clouds or fenny vapours, saving that
sometimes there ariseth from the Sea, and the River <HI>Dee,</HI> certain thick and smoaky seeming Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,
which nevertheless are not found hurtful to the Inhabitants, who in this part live long and health|fully.</P>
<P>(4) The Clime is somewhat colder there than in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> by reason of the Sea, and the River that
engi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ts the better part of her; by which, the Northern-winds, being long carried upon the Waters,
blow the more cold; and that side of the Country upward, that lieth shoring unto the top, having
nei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">her shelter nor defence, receiveth them in their still power, and is naturally a Bulwark from their
<PB REF="160">
violence unto her bordering Neighbours, that maketh the Snow to lie much longer there than on the
other side of the River.</P>
<P>(5) The Soil bringeth forth plenty both of Corn and Grass, as also great store of Cattel, but they
be little. To supply which defect, they have more by much in their numbers than in other places
where they be bigger. Great store of Fish they take in the River of <HI>Dee,</HI> but little from the Sea, by
reason they have no Havens or Creeks for Boats. No great store of Woods either there or in any o|ther
part of <HI>Wales</HI> are found, it having been a general plague unto all the Country ever since the head-strong
Rebellions of their Princes and great Men against the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> that (in time) took
away the principal helps of their Innovations, by cutting down their Woods, whereof in this Shire
there hath heretofore been great plenty. Fruits are scarce, but Milk, Butter and Cheese plenty, as al|so
store of Honey, of the which they make a pleasant Wine, in colour like (in taste not much unlike) unto
Muskadine, which they call <HI>Metheglin.</HI> Yea, and in the days of <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis,</HI> near the place
now called <HI>Holy-Well,</HI> was a rich Mine of Silver, in seeking after which, men pierced and pried into the
very bowels of the earth.</P>
<P>(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Ordovices,</HI> a sturdy People against the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
but now most kind and gentle towards the <HI>English,</HI> and indeed make much of all Srangers, ex|cept
they be crossed: and then they are the contrary.</P>
<P>(7) Places of defence are the Castles of <HI>Flint, Hawarden,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Harden, Treer, Rudland, Mold,
Yowley,</HI> and <HI>Hope:</HI> of which <HI>Flint</HI> and <HI>Harden</HI> are the two principal. The Castle of <HI>Flint,</HI> famous for
the benefit it received from two Kings, and for the refuge and relief it gave unto the third. It was
founded by <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, finished by <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and long after gave harbour and enter|tainment
to that noble, but unfortunate Prince, <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, coming out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> being
within her Walls a free and absolute King, but no sooner without, but taken Prisoner by <HI>Henry Bul|lingbroke,</HI>
<PB REF="161">
Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> losing at that time his liberty, and not long after his life. This standeth
in the graduation of Latitude 53, 55 minutes, in Longitude 17.</P>
<P>For the Castle of <HI>Hawarden,</HI> no Record remains of the first Founder, but that it was held a long time
by the Stewards of the Earls of <HI>Chester.</HI> Howbeit their resistances did not so genearally consist in the
strength of their Castles and Fortifications, as in their Mountains and Hills, which in times of danger
served as natural Bulwarks and Defences unto them against the force of Enemies. As was that which
standeth in a certain strait set about with Woods, near unto the River <HI>Alen,</HI> called <HI>Coles-hull,</HI> that is,
<HI>Coles-hill,</HI> where the <HI>English,</HI> by reason of their disordered multitude, not ranged in good array, lost
the Field, and were defeated, when King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second had made as great preparation as might
be to give Battel unto the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and the very Kings Standard was forsaken by <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Essex,</HI> who was
Standard-Bearer to the Kings of <HI>England</HI> in right of inheritance.</P>
<P>(8) This Country hath many shallow Rivers in it, but none of fame and note, but <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Cluyde.</HI>
Howbeit, there is a Spring not far from <HI>Rudland Castle,</HI> of great report and antiquity, which is ter|med
<HI>Fons Sacer,</HI> in English, <HI>Holy-Well,</HI> and is also commonly called S. <HI>Winefrids-Well;</HI> of whom an|tiquity
thus reporteth: That <HI>Winefrid</HI> a Christian Virgin, very fair and vertuous, was doated upon
by a young lustful Prince or Lord of the Country, who not long able to rule his head-strong affecti|ons,
having many times in vain attempted and tried her chastity, both by rich gifts and large pro|mises,
could not by any means obtain his desires; he therefore (in a place of advantage) suddenly
surprised and ravished her weak (yet resisting) body. After the deed done, the cruel Tyrant, to
stop her cries and acclamations, slew her, and cut off her head; out of which place did suddenly
arise a Spring that continueth to this day, carrying from the Fountain such a forcible stream and
Current, as the like is not found in Christendom. Over the Head of the Spring there is built a
Chappel of Free-stone, with Pillars curiously wrought and engraved, in the Chancel whereof, and
<PB REF="161">
Glass-Window, the Picture of the Virgin is drawn, together with the memorial of her Life and Death,
To this Fountain Pilgrims are accustomed to repair in their zealous, but blind devotion; and divers
others resort to Bath in, holding firmly that the water is of much vertue.</P>
<P>There be many red Stones in the bottom of this Well, and much green Moss growing upon the
sides: the superstition of the People holding that those red spots in the Stones were drops of the La|dies
Blood, which all the Water in the Spring can never wash away; and that the Moss about the
Wall was her Hair, which though some of it be given to every Stranger that comes, yet it never wa|steth.
But howsoever this be carried for truth by the Tradition of time, the Moss it self smells exceed|ing
sweet.</P>
<P>There is also hard by <HI>Kilken</HI> (a small Village) within this County, a little Well of no great note,
that at certain times riseth and falleth, after the manner of Sea-tydes.</P>
<P>(9) In the South-part of this Country, divided from the rest, is a place ( in some written Co|pies
of <HI>Antonine,</HI> called <HI><UNCLEAR>Bovium</UNCLEAR></HI>) which we now term <HI>Banchor,</HI> first a City, and afterwards a Mona|stery
of famous memory, and the first that is read of in the World: wherein (as <HI>Beda</HI> saith) were a
great number of Monks, and them divided into seven Companies, every one having his several Ru|ler
assigned. None of these Companies had less than three hundred Persons devoted to Prayer, and
to get living by their own labour, for themselves and the poor: although it hath long since been ut|terly
ruinate, so as now there is scarce seen the face and outward shew of a dead City or Mona|stery.
It hath only the names of two Gates remaining, one standing a mile di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tant from another,
and betwixt which the River <HI>Dee</HI> now runneth, where are often-times found many pieces of <HI>Roman</HI>
Coyn, and other tokens of antiquity. But of these shall be more mention made in the following
History.</P>
<P>Another like Monastery, but of lesser account, stood in the Vale beneath <HI>Varish</HI> (a little City placed
<PB REF="162">
by the <HI>Romans</HI> in the consines of this Shire and <HI>Denbigh-shire</HI>) and upon the Bank of <HI>Elwy</HI> and <HI>Cluyd.</HI>
This the <HI>Britains</HI> call <HI>Llan-Elwy,</HI> of the River; the <HI>Englishmen, Asaph,</HI> of the Founder; and the <HI>Histo|riographers,
Asaphensis.</HI> It is more famoused for antiquity, than for building or bravery: for about the
year 560 <HI>Kentigern</HI> Bishop of <HI>Glasco,</HI> being fled hither out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> placed here a Bishops See, and

<HEAD>ANGLESEY.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>ANGLESEY was in the time of the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Mona,</HI> by the <HI>Britains Mon,</HI> and <HI>Ver-Mon,</HI>
(that is) the Land of <HI>Mon,</HI> of the ancient <HI>England-Saxons Moneg:</HI> And at last,
after the <HI>Englishmen</HI> had by their sharp and several assaults brought it under their rule,
and became Lords thereof, it was termed <HI>Anglesey,</HI> as one would say, <HI>The Englishmens
Island.</HI></P>
<P>(2) For an <HI>Island</HI> it is, albeit it be severed from the Continent of <HI>Britain,</HI> but with a small and
narrow straight of the River <HI>Menai,</HI> and on all other parts beaten upon with the surging and troublous
<HI>Irish Sea,</HI> in which it lyeth somewhat square-wise not much different in length and breadth; being,
where it reacheth out in length, from <HI>Beau-marish</HI> Eastward, to the utmost Promontory Westward,
which we call <HI>Holy-head,</HI> twenty miles; and in breadth from <HI>Llambederick</HI> Northward, to the point
of <HI>Menai</HI> Southward, seventeen miles; the whole circuit or circumference amounting towards seventy
miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is reasonable grateful and healthful, and not generally subject to Diseases, excepting
certain Agues at sometimes, which are occasioned by the Fogs and misty Exhalations, which arise from
the Sea called <HI>Mare Virginium,</HI> with the which this Isle is encompassed.</P>
<P>(4) The Commodities that commend (or rather beautifie) this Country, are in Corn and Cat|tel,
wherewith it not only enricheth it self exceedingly, but sendeth out great Provision thereof to
others to supply their defects, and although the ground may seem dry and stony, or unpleasant and
nothing sightly, wherein for the outward quality it resembleth some other parts of <HI>Wales,</HI> that
are not so fruitful, yet for the inward bounties of nature, it is far unlike; for above all the
<PB REF="163">
Coasts of <HI>Wales</HI> it is most plentiful of Wheat, insomuch as by <HI>Giraldus Cambre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sis</HI> report, they are wont
to say in <HI>Welsh,</HI> by way of a Proverb, <HI>Mon Mam Cambry,</HI> which is to say, <HI>Mon</HI> is the Mother of <HI>Wales;</HI>
for that when other Countries Harvest fails round about, or their Provision is exhaust and drawn dry,
this alone, like a provident and full breasted Mother is able to sustain the rest. Whereunto Nature
most providently hath added another benefit serviceable and necessary to the former, in that the
Country produceth also those kind of Stones which are called <HI>Molares,</HI> as of all other fittest to make
<HI>Millstones</HI> or <HI>Grindstones.</HI> In some places also it yieldeth an Earth of <HI>Aluminous</HI> quality, out of which
some not long since began to make <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI> and <HI>Copperose,</HI> who (like unflesht Souldiers) gave over their en|terprise
without further hope, because at first they saw it not answer their over-hasty expectations.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Ordovines,</HI> mentioned before in the prece|dent
Provinces of <HI>Denbigh-shire, Flint-shire,</HI> and <HI>Carnarvon-shire.</HI> And this very Island was that an|cient,
and so much ennobled Seat of the <HI>British Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">yds,</HI> who so amated the Army of <HI>Roman</HI> Invaders,
as <HI>Tacitus</HI> reports, and as else-where we have related in the sixth Book and seventh Chapter of our en|suing
History.</P>
<P>(6) This Nation was attempted first by <HI>Paulinus Suetonius</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> but brought under
the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire by <HI>Iulius Agricola.</HI> When the Empire of the <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> began to decline
and go downward, some out of <HI>Ireland</HI> entred into this Isle by stealth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">estled themselves there, as
may be gathered by certain mounts of earth entrenched about, and yet to be seen, which they call the
<HI>Irish-mens Cottages:</HI> as also by a place named of the <HI>Irish-men, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hiericy G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">idid,</HI> who did there (as
is recorded) put the <HI>Britains</HI> to flight under the leading of <HI>Sirigus.</HI> The <HI>Norwegians</HI> also were often
infestuous to this Island; but King <HI>Ethelreds</HI> Fleet, having in the year 1000 scoured the Seas round
about this Isle, far exceeded all both <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Norwegian</HI> depopulations, for they was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the Coun|try
in all hostile manner.</P>
<P><PB REF="164">(7) After this, two <HI>Hughs,</HI> both <HI>Normans,</HI> did greatly afflict this Island: The one being Earl of
<HI>Chester,</HI> the other of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> at which very time <HI>Magnus</HI> the <HI>Norwegian</HI> arriving there, shot <HI>Hugh</HI>

<P>(8) The principal Town in this Isle is <HI>Beaumarish,</HI> which the said King <HI>Edward</HI> the First built in

the affairs of this Town are orderly managed and commanded: whose Latitude is 54, and Lon|gitude
15, 45 minutes.</P>
<P>(10) Not far from hence is <HI>Lhaanvais,</HI> in times past a fair Religious House of the <HI>Friers Minors,</HI>
which although it be now in a manner rased out of memory, yet antiquity maketh mention that it hath

<HEAD>CAERNARVON-SHIRE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHAPTER. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>CAERNARVON-SHIRE, in <HI>Welsh, Sire Caer-ar-v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> so called because it is just over against
<HI>Anglesey,</HI> (which the <HI>Britains</HI> call <HI>Mon</HI>) and in composition was termed also <HI>Snowden-Forrest,</HI>
before <HI>Wales</HI> was laid into Shires; the North-side whereof and the West butteth
upon the <HI>Irish-Sea,</HI> the South-side is inclosed with <HI>Merioneth,</HI> and the East with <HI>Den|bigh
shires,</HI> from which it is severed by the River <HI>Conwey.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is much like a wedge, long and narrow towards the South and growing still
wider towards the North: so that from <HI>Pev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nkel-point</HI> Southward, to <HI>Orms-head-point</HI> Northward,
are forty miles, from the River <HI>Conwey</HI> Eastward, to the River <HI>Ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">noy</HI> Westward, miles twenty: and
the whole circumference one hundred and ten miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is sharp and piercing, by reason that the Country hath not natural Provision to en|sconce
her self against the extremity of Winds and Weather: but especially, as may be thought, through
the continuance of the Snow on the Hills, which also exclude the Suns aspect and warmth.</P>
<P>(4) The Soil cannot be much commended for the fertility, except those parts of the Sea-coasts,
which lie on the West towards <HI>Ireland:</HI> but for the heart of this Shire, it is altogether mountainous,
as if nature had a purpose here, by rearing up these craggy Hills so thick together, strongly to com|pact
the joynts of this our Island, and to frame the Inland part thereof for a fit place of refuge to the
<HI>Britains,</HI> against those times of adversity which afterward did fall upon them; for no Army, though
never so strongly, or scarce any Travellers, though never so lightly appointed, can find passage a|mong
those so many rough and hard Rocks, so many Vales and Pools here and there, crossing
<PB REF="165">
all the ways, as ready obstacles to repel any Inroads of forrain assailants. These Mountains may not
unfitly be termed the <HI>British Alps,</HI> as being the most vast of all <HI>Britain,</HI> and for their steepness and crag|giness
not unlike to those of <HI>Italy,</HI> all of them towring up into the Air, and round encompassing one
far higher than all the rest, peculiarly called <HI>Snowdon Hills,</HI> though the other likewise in the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e
sense, are by the <HI>Welsh</HI> termed <HI>Craig Eriry,</HI> as much as <HI>Snowy Mountains,</HI> taking their name as doth
(by <HI>Plinies</HI> testimony) <HI>Niphates</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> and <HI>Imaus</HI> in <HI>Scythia:</HI> For all the year long these lie man|telled
over with Snow hard crusted together, though otherwise for their height they are open and liable
both to the Sun to dissolve them, and the Winds to over-sweep them.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ovices,</HI> of whom we have sufficiently
spoken in the description of the former Provinces; neither need I insist either upon the pleasures or
profits that this Country yieldeth, by reason of the great affinity it hath both of Climate and Commo|dities
with <HI>Denbigh-shire</HI> and <HI>Flint-shire</HI> before mentioned: But this beyond the other in some places
breeds certain <HI>Shel-fishes,</HI> which being conceived by an heavenly dew, bring forth Pearls, in ancient
times more reckoned of than now they are.</P>
<P>(6) Touching places of note, that City is very ancient which the Emperour <HI>Antonine</HI> call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">h
<HI>Segontium,</HI> taking name of a River running by, which at this day is called <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ent:</HI> some Reliques of

Publicius.</HI> This City <HI>Ninius</HI> calleth <HI>Caer Custenith,</HI> which some interpret the City of <HI>Constantine.</HI>
Indeed <HI>Matthew Westminster</HI> saith (how true I know not) that <HI>Anno</HI> 1283. here was found the body
of <HI>Constantius</HI> (Father to Great <HI>Constantine</HI>) which King <HI>Edward</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> first caused to be sumptuously
bestowed in the Church of the new City, which he raised out of the ruins of the old, and is now
called <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> which giveth name to this whole Shire. The Town it self yieldeth a most

excellent prospect towards the Sea, and is incompassed (in a manner) round with the Walls of the Ca|stle:
so as we may say, it is a City within a Castle, which taketh up the whole West-side of it: and
great pity it is, that so famous a work should not be perpetuous, or ever become the ruin of time, which
is much feared, for the merciless underminings of the Sea, that with her daily and forcible irruptions ne|ver
ceaseth to wash away the Foundations of the Key. The People of this Town are well approved
for courtesie, and also Civil Government, which is administred by the Constable of the Castle (who
is ever Mayor by Patent) having the assistance of one <HI>Alderman,</HI> two <HI>Bailiffs,</HI> two <HI>Sergeants</HI> at <HI>Mace,</HI>
and one <HI>Town-Cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">k.</HI> The Townsmen do not a little glory that King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second was born
there, in a Tower of the Castle called <HI>Eagle-Tower,</HI> and surnamed of <HI>Caer-nar-von,</HI> he being the first
Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Line. The site of this Town according to Mathematical observation is
in the degree of Longitude 15 and 50 scruples from the first West point, and the Pole elevated in La|titude 53 and 50.</P>
<P><HI>Bangor</HI> the Bishops See, though it be now but a small Town, yet it was in time past so large, that
for the greatness thereof it was called <HI>Banchor-Vaur,</HI> that is, <HI>Great-Banchor;</HI> which <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Che|ster</HI>
fortified with a Castle: But it hath been long since utterly ruinated and laid level with the ground,
insomuch as there is not any footing to be found or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">her monuments left thereof, although they have
been sought with all diligent enquiry. This Bishops See hath been the Diocess of ninety six Parishes.
But the ancient Church which was consecrated unto <HI>Daniel,</HI> sometime Bishop thereof, was defaced
and set on fire by that notorious Rebel <HI>Owen Glendowerdwy,</HI> who had a purpose also to destroy all the
Cities of <HI>Wales,</HI> for that they stood for the King of <HI>England.</HI> And though the same Church was since
repaired about the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, yet hath it scarce recovered the resemblance of her
former dignity.</P>
<P><PB REF="166">The River <HI>Conwey</HI> (which limiteth this Shire on the East-side) is in <HI>Ptolomy</HI> by corruption or igno|rance
of Transcribers called <HI>Toissonius,</HI> instead of <HI>Cononius,</HI> whence <HI>Canonium</HI> (a Town mentioned by
<HI>Antonine</HI>) took name: and albeit both it and its name be now utterly extinct, yet is there a covert re|membrance
thereof in the new name of a poor Village, standing among the rubbish thereof, called
<HI>Caer-hean,</HI> (that is) the ancient City: Out of the Spoil whereof King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, built a new
Town at the Rivers mouth, termed thereupon <HI>Aber-Conwey:</HI> (that is) the mouth of <HI>Conwey,</HI> which
being formerly fortified by <HI>Hugh</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI> and strongly situate and senced both with Walls and a fair
Castle by the Rivers side, deserves rather the name of a City than a Town, if it were more populous
and traffiqued with Inhabitants. Neither must I here forget <HI>Nowin,</HI> though but a small Market-Town,
for that it pleased the English Nobles, <HI>Anno</HI> 1284, to honour it and the memory of King <HI>Ar|thur,</HI>
with triumphant celebrity, after they had subdued the rebellious Ringleaders of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>(7) Other matters of memorable note this Country affordeth not much, unless perhaps this: That
just over-against the River <HI>Conwey,</HI> where it issueth into the Sea, there sometimes stood an ancient City
named <HI>Diganwey,</HI> which many years ago was consumed by Lightning, and so made utterly desolate,
as many other Monuments have been, of ancient and worthy memory. As likewise that in the Pool
<HI>Lin-Peris,</HI> there is a kind of Fish called there <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rcoth,</HI> having a red Belly, no where else seen. For

there are two Pools called the <HI>Mears,</HI> the one of which produceth great store of Fish, but all having
only one Eye, and the other there is a moveable Island, which as soon as a man treadeth thereon, it forth|with
floateth a great way off, whereby the <HI>Welsh</HI> are said to have often scaped and deluded their Ene|mies
assailing them: these matters are out of my Creed, and yet I think the Reader had rather be|lieve
them, than to go to see whether it be so or no.</P>

<P>(2) This Kingdom is fair and spacious, and from these South borders spreadeth it self wide
into the East and West, till again it contracts it self, narrower unto the Northern Promontories: fur|nished
with all things befitting a famous Kingdom; both for Air and Soil, Rivers, Woods, Mountains,
Fish, Fowl, and Cattel, and Corn so plenteous, that it supplyeth therewith other Countries in their
want. The People thereof are of good feature, strong of body, and of couragious mind, and in Wars
so venturous, that scarce any service of note hath been performed, but that they were with the first and
last in the Field. Their Nobility and Gentry are very studious of learning, and all civil knowledge;
for which end they not only frequent the three Universities of their own Kingdom (S. <HI>Andrews, Glasco,</HI>

there was no other bounds of <HI>Britain</HI> to be sought for: and that here the second Legion <HI>Augusta,</HI>
and the 20 Legion <HI>Victrix,</HI> built a part of the Wall, certain Inscriptions there digged up, and reserved
at <HI>Dunloyr</HI> and <HI>Cader</HI> do witness: as also an ancient coped Monument of an high and round compass,
which as some think, was a Temple consecrated unto the God <HI>Terminus;</HI> others, a Trophy raised by
<HI>Carausius,</HI> who fortified this Wall with seven Castles, as <HI>Ninius</HI> doth declare.</P>

so hateful to mankind, that they abhoried whatsoever was by them handled or breathed upon: these

Story.</P>
<P>(13) <HI>Ninian</HI> a <HI>Britain</HI> is recorded to have converted the <HI>South-Picts</HI> unto the Faith of Christ in
the Reign of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ger, and the Church in <HI>Galloway</HI> bearing his name doth witness it:

Cattel, Fish, and Fowl there abiding: their Neat but little, yet many in number: Fish so plentiful,
that men in some places (for delight) on Horse-back hunt <HI>Salmons</HI> with Spears: and a certain Fowl,

<P>(18) The <HI>Western</HI> lying scattered in the <HI>Deucalidonian</HI> Sea, were anciently ruled by a King of their
own, whose maintenance was out of their common Coffers, and the Regal Authority never continued in
lineal succession, for (to prevent that) their Kings were not permitted to have Wives of their own, but
might by their Laws accompany with other mens: as the like Law was in the other parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
that the Virginity of all new Wives, should be the Landlords prey, till King <HI>Malcolme</HI> enacted, that half a
mark should be paid for redemption. The residence of those fore-mentioned Kings, was chiefly in <HI>Ila,

Sheep, where in some they are wild, and in others without any owners; but the People uncivil, and
lacking Religion, they rather live rudely in state of necessity, than as Lords of these portions which
God hath allotted them; and with a sufferable ease, ignorant of ambition, enjoy those contentments,
which some others (though they no great sum) do more laboriously attain unto by the Precepts of
Philosophy: for feeding themselves with competency without any excess, they return all the over-plus
unto their Lords, as do the Inhabitants of <HI>Hirta</HI> and <HI>Rona:</HI> but alas, Religion not known among

the vertuous Souls of the dead passed the uttermost bounds of earthly abode, and attained to an ever-pleasing
repose, and ever-flourishing happiness; which whether they borrowed from the description of
Paradise, (taken both for a fair Garden and the Souls happy rest) I cannot define; but sure they would
not have made those Fields always green, if they had seen how they lie ever covered with Ice and Snow,

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THe Traditions of time have delivered unto us divers names, whereby this famous Island is
recorded to have been called: yet none of more fair probabili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y, than that of <HI>Ortheus,
Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Claudian,</HI> by whom it is named <HI>Ierna:</HI> by <HI>Iuvenal</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> called <HI>Iu|verna,</HI>
by <HI>Diodorus Siculus, Iris:</HI> by <HI>Martian</HI> of <HI>Heraclea, Ioyepnia:</HI> by <HI>Eustachius,
Oyernia</HI> and <HI>Bernia:</HI> by the native Inhabitants, <HI>Erin:</HI> by the <HI>Britains Yverdon:</HI> the
<HI>Welsh.</HI> Bards in their Ballads, <HI>Tirvolas, Totidanan</HI> and <HI>Banno:</HI> and by the <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ish, Ireland,</HI> But from
whence these diversities were derived, arise many opinions. Doubtless it is, that <HI>Hibernia, Iuverna,</HI>
and <HI>Overnia,</HI> came from <HI>Ierna,</HI> spoken of by <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Aristotle;</HI> and the same <HI>Ierna,</HI> as al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>Iris,
Iverdhon,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> from <HI>Erin,</HI> the term that the Inhabitants now us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. From this <HI>Erin</HI> therefore
(a word proper to the Nation) the original is most likely to be deduced.</P>
<P>(2) Some derive <HI>Hibernia</HI> from <HI>Hiberno tempore,</HI> that is, from the Winter season; some from <HI>Hi|berus</HI>
a <HI>Spaniard;</HI> some from a Duke named <HI>Irnalph;</HI> some again from the ancient River <HI>Iberus,</HI> and
some from <HI>Hiere,</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> word, which signifieth the West, or a Western&punc; Coast, whence <HI>Erin</HI> may also
seem to fetch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he derivation: for it lieth furthest Westward of any Region in ail <HI>Europe.</HI> As also for
that the River running in the most remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e West-part of this Island, is in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">olomy</HI> called <HI>Iernus;</HI> like as
the furthest Western Promontory in <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence our <HI>Irish</HI>-Men came, is by <HI>Strabo</HI> called
<PB REF="176">
<HI>Ierne,</HI> and the River next unto it, by <HI>Mela, Ierna:</HI> yea, and <HI>Spain</HI> it self, for the Western situation, is
called <HI>Hesperia:</HI> the West-Cape of <HI>Africk&punc; Hesperium;</HI> and in <HI>Germany, Westrich</HI> and <HI>Westphalen</HI> from
their position have their names. <HI>Postelius</HI> (a man that rather followed his own fancy, than the judge|ment
of others (fetcheth the original of <HI>Ireland</HI> from the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as if I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in should be as much as <HI>Iu|rin,</HI>
that is the <HI>Iews</HI> land: which opinion I hold no better than those that would have it from the
Winter-like storms, although upon every Wind the Air is cold there.</P>
<P>(3) <HI>Festus Avienus,</HI> in that little Book which he entituled <HI>Orae Maritimae,</HI> calleth <HI>Ireland, Sacram In|sulam,</HI>
that is, The holy Island: to which opinion the people are soon drawn, by reason of the many
Saints that the Island is said to produce, and the blessed Soil that affords no venomous Creatures to re|tain
Life. It is thought that <HI>Plutarch</HI> meant <HI>Ireland</HI> by his <HI>Ogygia,</HI> for her great antiquity; and of
latter times by <HI>Isidore</HI> and <HI>Bede</HI> it was called <HI>Scotia,</HI> of those <HI>Scots</HI> that inhabited it: and that thence
the name of <HI>Scotland,</HI> together with the <HI>Scots</HI> themselves, came into <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>(4) For largeness and circuit, in times past, this Island challenged the third place in rank of all the
Isles of the then known World for thus have Geographers left us, that the <HI>Indian Taproban</HI> for great|ness
was the first, the Isle of <HI>Britain</HI> the next, and this of <HI>Ireland</HI> the third: and for that cause doth
<HI>Ptolomy</HI> call it the <HI>Little-Britain.</HI> But howsoever <HI>Strabo</HI> hath extended the breadth, as broad as the
length, and others have formed it in shape like an Egg, yet later dimensions have found it far other|wise,
twice longer than broad, and may be compared to the fore-leg of a Bear, if the <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ile</HI> breed no
offence. Whose East-side hath on it that tempes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uous Sea that cutteth her Channel betwixt <HI>England</HI>
and this <HI>Ireland:</HI> the West is washed with the Western-Ocean; the North with the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ucaledonian,</HI>
and the South with the <HI>Virginian-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>(5) The Air of this Island is delectable and wholsom, though neither so clear nor subtil as is
<PB REF="177">
ours of <HI>England,</HI> which (as <HI>Mela</HI> saith) is nothing favourable for the ripening of Corn: but so grate|ful
to the ground, that it causeth grass to grow abundantly, not only fresh and long, but withal very
sweet for all Cattel, and in Winter is more subject to Wind than Snow: and that I may use the words
of <HI>Giraldus, It is of all Countri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s most temperate, neither forcing the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">habitants to seek shade from the
frying heat of</HI> Cancer, <HI>nor the chilling cold of</HI> Capricorn <HI>to drive t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">em to the fire:</HI> but at all seasons most
mild, betwixt a sufferable cold, and gentle warm heat.</P>
<P>(6) The Soil (saith <HI>Cambrensis</HI>) is uneven, woody, wild, waterish, and boggy, so full of Loughs
and Mears, that great Ponds of Water are found upon the high Mountains. These indeed make the
places somewhat dangerous unto all new Commers, by breeding of Rheums, Dysenteries and Fluxes,
whose usual remedy is <HI>Vskebah,</HI> a wholsome <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> that drieth more, and enflameth less, than
many other hot Confections.</P>
<P>(7) The Commodities of this Kingdom chiefly consist in Cattel, whose seed is so sweet and so rank,
that they will soon graze to a surfeit, if they may be suffered to feed as they will. Their Sheep are
many, but bear not the best Wooll, which twice are shorn within one year. Of these they make Man|tles,
Caddowes, and Coverlets, vented from thence into forrain Countries. Their Hobbies likewise
are of great esteem, and are answerable to the Ienners of <HI>Spain.</HI> Bees are there in such abundance,
that honey is found in holes of Trees, and in rests of the Rocks. No annoyance of hurtful Snake or
venomous Creatures: and to speak all in a word, nothing wanting for profit or pleasure: for so much
doth <HI>Giraldus</HI> affirm, in saying, that <HI>Nature had cast into this Western Kingdom of</HI> Zephyrus <HI>a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re gra|cious
eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">han was ordinary.</HI></P>
<P>(3) Touching the original peopling of this fair Island, if we will believe their Records, they
make antiquity it self but young unto themselves, affirming the Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sel <HI>Caesarea,</HI> and Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ce unto
<PB REF="177">
<HI>Noah,</HI> to have found it out before the Flood; and that three hundred years after, when <HI>Iaphets</HI> po|sterity
took into these Wests-parts of the World, one <HI>Bartholarus</HI> of his Progeny, a <HI>Scythian</HI> by birth,
encouraged by the late success of <HI>Nimrod</HI> (who now had intruded upon the Monarchy of <HI>Syria</HI>)
wandred so far West, that <HI>Fortune</HI> at last cast him and his people upon the coast of <HI>Ireland.</HI> There he
setled with his three sons, <HI>Languinna, Salanus,</HI> and <HI>Ruthurgus,</HI> who searching through every creek and
corner of the Land, left their own names by three notable places, <HI>Languini, Stragrus,</HI> and Mount <HI>Sa|langa,</HI>
which the revolution of times hath since called by other names, as S. <HI>Dominickhill, Ruthurgi,</HI>
and <HI>Stagnum.</HI> Under the government of these three sons, and their off-spring, this Land was kept
about three hundred years; at which time there arrived also in <HI>Ireland,</HI> a Giant-like kind of People of
<HI>Nimrods</HI> race, who in bodily shape exceeded the proportion of usual men, using their strengths to
win soveraignties, and to oppress with rapine and violence. These growing to numbers, accounted it
necessary to prevent dominion, lest the curse of slavery (prophecied by <HI>Noah</HI>) should light upon them:
to prevent the which, they set up a King of their own; then quarrels bred daily, either parties pur|posing
to hold their interest by their Swords; against whom, lastly a Battel was fought, and an infinite
company of Giants slain; when also died most of those of the posterity of <HI>Iapheth,</HI> leaving them of
<HI>Cham</HI> Lords of the Island.</P>
<P>(9) Whereupon <HI>Nemethus</HI> a <HI>Scythian</HI> with his four Sons, arrived in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and by strong hand
seated themselves among these Giants; where for two hundred and sixty years they kept, but then no
longer able to hold out against them, they left their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tandings, and departed the Land.</P>
<P>(10) Soon after, the five Sons of <HI>Dela,</HI> descended from the said <HI>Nemetheus,</HI> came into these coasts,
and with manly prowess drove these miscreants out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whereby the Seed of <HI>Cham</HI> was utterly
expelled, and these of <HI>Iapheth</HI> divided the Land into five parts, whereof they became themselves Kings:
<PB REF="178">
but falling at variance, gave advantage unto others, among whom the BRITAINS set in a foot.</P>
<P>(11) But to make this Island more famous, certain Historians have fetched their Kings from most
uncertain Records, as namely from <HI>Gaothel</HI> the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Scotia,</HI> (the daughter of King <HI>Pharaoh,</HI>
and nourisher of <HI>Moses</HI>) his Wife: who at that time, when <HI>Israel</HI> were in <HI>Egypt,</HI> with a Colony came
into <HI>Spain,</HI> and after into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he was made King, and in honour of his Queen, the Land
named <HI>Scotia,</HI> from whom also the Inhabitants took name: his posterity increasing in the parts of
<HI>Spain,</HI> where first they had seated, in process of time sought further adventures under the four Sons of
<HI>Milesius</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> whose names were <HI>Hibernus, Hermion, Euer,</HI> and <HI>Erimon.</HI></P>
<P>(12) These, by the direction, sufferance and assistance of <HI>Gurguntius,</HI> King of the <HI>Britains,</HI> after
that <HI>Ireland</HI> had been very much dispeopled by a contagious pestilence, seated themselves, and from the
eldest, <HI>Hibernus,</HI> called the Island <HI>Hibernia,</HI> as some are of opinion: these divided the whole into five
Provinces, famously known by the names of <HI>Mounster, Leinster, Connaught, Vlster,</HI> and <HI>Meath</HI> in their
midst: and from these the present <HI>Irish</HI> repute themselves to come. Yet surely, as I make no question,
but that this Island became inhabited even of old time, when mankind again over-spread the face of
the earth, so doubt I not, but that our <HI>Britains</HI> passed thereinto themselves, such infinite number of words
in the <HI>Irish</HI> language yet in use, such ancient names of Waters, Isles, Mountains, and Places, meerly
<HI>British</HI> words, yet remaining, and the testimony of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who saith, that their manners were fashi|oned
to the <HI>Britains,</HI> inforceth so much; and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> before him, calleth that Island by the name of
<HI>Little-Britain:</HI> all which shew a former interest for <HI>Ireland,</HI> than that which by conquest under <HI>Henry</HI>
the second was made.</P>
<P><PB REF="178">(13) That it ever was subject to the <HI>Romans,</HI> is doubtful, though <HI>Agricola</HI> did wish it, and <HI>Tacitus</HI>
held most necessary: yea, and in the division of their Empire, <HI>Ireland,</HI> with <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Thule,</HI> fell
unto <HI>Constantine</HI> the Son of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great; yet their Manners unreclaimed, and barbarism
retained long after those days, do witness no such civility sown, to be in that plot. But when <HI>Romes</HI>
great Empire began to grow less, the <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Scythians</HI> grew mighty in <HI>Ireland&punc;</HI> and as <HI>Orosius</HI> writeth,
that Island was wholly inhabited by the <HI>Scottish</HI> Nation in the days of <HI>Honorius,</HI> and <HI>Arcadius,</HI> the Em|perours:
whose Wars and Slaughter, <HI>Claudian</HI> doth lightly touch in this his Verse.</P>
<L>Scotorum tumulos flevit glacialis <HI>Ierne.</HI></L>
<L>The frozen <HI>Ireland</HI> wept to see, her <HI>Scots</HI> all slain on heaps to be.</L>
<P>(14) <HI>As these for the most part, by the testimony of</HI> Ninius, <HI>were the ancient Inhabitants, so by
other ancient Writers, their customs and manners are thus set forth:</HI> Strabo <HI>saith,</HI> The Inhabitants of
Ireland are more rude than the <HI>Britains&punc;</HI> they feed upon the flesh of men, yea, and think it a point of worth
to eat their dead Parents: wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tonly they accompany with women, making no difference of other mens
wives, their own sisters, nor of their natural mothers: but of these things (<HI>saith he</HI>) we have no certain
witness of sufficient credit. Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ponius Mela <HI>recordeth,</HI> That the <HI>Irish</HI> are uncivil, ignorant of vertues,
and void of Religion. <HI>And</HI> Solinus <HI>affirmeth,</HI> That after victory they drink the blood of the slain, and
besmear their own faces therewith, so given to war, that the mother at the birth of a man-child, feedeth the
first meat into her Infants mouth, upon the point of her husbands sword, and with heathenish imprecations,
wisheth that it may die no otherwise than in war or by sword.</P>
<P>(15) But from these ancient and barbarous manners, let us come to the conditions of their mid|dle
time; whom <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> describeth as followeth: <HI>The</HI> Irish (saith he) <HI>are a strong and bold
<PB REF="179">
people, martial and prodigal in War, nimble, stout, and haughty of heart; careless of life, but greedy of
glory; courteous to stranger, constant in love, light of belief, impatient of injury, given to fleshly lusts, and
in e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mity implacable.</HI> At the baptizing of their Infants, their manner was, not to dip their right
arms into the water, that so (as they thought) they might give a more deep and incurable blow; ne|ver
calling them by the names of their Parents whilst they lived together, but at their death took it
upon them. Their women nursed not the children they bare; and they that nursed others, did affect
and love them much more than their own.</P>
<P>(16) So much were they given to fantastical conceits, that they held it very ominous to give their
neighbours fire upon <HI>May-day:</HI> to eat an old Egg, endangered the death of their Horse: and before
they cast in their Seed, they send Salt into the Field: to hang up the Shells in the Roof, was a preser|vative
of the Chickens from the Kite: to set up green Boughs at their Doors in the Moneth of <HI>May,</HI>
increased their Kines Milk; and to spit upon Cattel, they held it good against Witchery, whereof <HI>Ire|land</HI>
was full.</P>
<P>(17) Superstitious Idolatry among the wilde <HI>Irish</HI> was common, yielding divine honour unto the
Moon after the change, unto whom they both bowed their knees and made supplications; and with a
loud voice would thus speak unto that Planet: <HI>We pray thee leave us in as good estate as thou foundst
us.</HI> Wolves they did make their Godsibs, terming them <HI>Chari Christ,</HI> and so thought themselves pre|served
from their hurts: the hoofs of dead Horses they accounted and held sacred: about childrens
necks they hung the beginning of Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> Gospel, a crooked nail of an horse-shoe, or a piece of
a Wolves Skin: and both the sucking-child and nurse were girt with Girdles finely plated of wo|mans
hair; so far they wandred into the ways of errour, in making these arms the strength of their
healths.</P>
<P>(18) Their Wives were many, by reason of divorcements, and their Maids married at twelve
<PB REF="179">
years of age, whose customs were to send to their Lovers Bracelets pleated, and curiously wrought of
their own Hair, so far following <HI>Venus</HI> in the Knots of these Allurements. The Men wore Linnen
Shirts exceedingly large, stained with Saffron, the Sleeves wide, and hanging to their Knees, strait and
sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rt Trusses plated thick in the Skirts, their Breeches close to the Thighs, a short Skein hanging
point down before, and a Mantle most times cast over their Heads. The Women wore their Hair plat|ed
in curious manner, hanging down their Backs and Shoulders, from under foulden Wreaths of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ne
Linnen, rolled about their Heads, rather loading the Wearer than delighting the Beholder: for as the
one was most seemly, so the other was unsightly: their Necks were hung with Chains and Carkanets,
their Arms wreathed with many Bracelets, and over their Side-garments the Shag-Rug Mantlets pur|fled
with a deep Fringe of divers colours, both Sexes accounting Idleness their only Liberty, and Ease
their greatest Riches.</P>
<P>(19) In Wars they were forward, and fought with Battle-Axes, whose Bearers were called <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">llog|lasses,</HI>
the Common-Souldier but lightly armed, who served with Darts and sharp Skeins; their Trum|pet
was a Bag-pipe, and Word for Encounter, <HI>Pharroh;</HI> which at the first Onset with great Acclama|tion
they uttered, and he that did not, was taken into the Air, and carried into the Vale of <HI>Kerry,</HI> where
transformed (as they did believe) he remaineth until he was hunted with Hounds from thence to his
home.</P>
<P>(20) For the Dying and Dead they hired Women to mourn, who expostulated with the Sick, why
he would die: and dead, at his Funerals such out-cries were made, such clapping of hands, such howl|ings
and gestures, that one would think their sorrows unrecoverable, holding the opinion of <HI>Pythag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ras</HI>
for the Souls departed.</P>
<P>(21) Their Diet in necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">y was slender, feeding upon Water-Cresses, Roots, Mushromes, Sham|rogh,
Butter tempered with Oat-meal, Milk, Whey, yea, and Raw-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, the Blood being crushed out&punc;
<PB REF="180">
their use was also to let their K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne blood, which standing a while, and coming to a jelly, with Butter
they did eat, as a very good Dish.</P>
<P>(22) That the Gospel of Christ should be preached in <HI>Ireland</HI> by <HI>Iames</HI> the Apostle, I will not
affirm, though <HI>Vicentius</HI> hath said it: neither will I, with the <HI>Scots,</HI> bring the Islands conversion from
a Christian woman, who (as their Historians do avouch) first instructed the Queen, and the Queen
her Husband, and he again his Subjects, till all became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hristians. But most true it is, that the <HI>Scots</HI>
first received the doctrine of Christ in this Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> for thus writeth <HI>Prosper:</HI> Caeles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">n
<HI>Pope of</HI> Rome <HI>sent his Archdeacon</HI> Palladius <HI>into</HI> Britain <HI>to withstand the</HI> Pelagian <HI>heresie, who at one time
did drive out these enemies of grace&punc; and ordained a Bishop among the</HI> Scots, <HI>whereby that barbarou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nation
embraced Christianity.</HI> Yet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">inius</HI> reporteth, That <HI>Palladius</HI> did nothing in neither being taken away
by untimely death: but that S. <HI>Patrick,</HI> born at <HI>Eiburne</HI> in <HI>Cluedsdale,</HI> the Son of <HI>Calphurus,</HI> by the
Sister of S. <HI>Martin,</HI> was the first Apostle for <HI>Ireland,</HI> who sowed his heavenly seed with such plentiful
increase, that the soil it self shortly was called <HI>Sanctorum Patria, The Country of Saints:</HI> for whose
Sepulchre after his dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h rose as great variance, as was for <HI>Homer</HI> amongst them of <HI>Greece:</HI> they of
<HI>Downe</HI> challenged his Grave to be with them, upon certain Verses written on a To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">b, which ascribes
<HI>Patrick, Bridget,</HI> and <HI>Columbe</HI> to be bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ied therein: they of <HI>Armagh</HI> lay claim by the warrant of
S. <HI>Bernard,</HI> who saith, that <HI>Patrick in his time there ruled, and after death there rested. Glascenbury</HI>
in <HI>England</HI> by ancient Records will have his body interred with them; and <HI>Scotland</HI> avo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cheth his
birth to be at <HI>Glasco,</HI> and bones to rest at <HI>Kirk Patrick</HI> with them: of such reverent esteem was this
<HI>Irish</HI> Apostle.</P>
<P>(23) This <HI>Patrick</HI> in his youth had been taken captive by the <HI>Irish</HI> Pirats, and for six years con|tinuance
served <HI>Machuain</HI> as his slave, and keeper of his Swine: in which dejected condition, so
desirous he was of the Lands Salvation, that in his Dreams he thought the Infants unborn cryed
<PB REF="180">
unto him for Baptism; and redeeming himself thence for a piece of Gold found in the Feld, which a
Swine had turned up, in his aged years came back again into <HI>Ireland,</HI> preached the Gospel converted
the People, and lastly became Archbishop of <HI>Armagh.</HI> Of whose miracles and Purgatory, I leave
others to speak; that are more credulous in the one, and have better leisure to relate the other; and
will shew thee <HI>Ireland,</HI> as now it is, first in general, and then in parts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THis Province, called in <HI>Irish, Mown;</HI> in a more ordinary construction of Speech, <HI>Wown,</HI>
in <HI>Latine, Momonia;</HI> and in <HI>English, Mounster;</HI> lieth open Southward to the <HI>Virgini|an
Sea:</HI> Northward it affronteth part of <HI>Connaught:</HI> The East is neighboured by
<HI>Leinster:</HI> and the West is altogether washed with the West-Ocean.</P>
<P>(2) The length thereof extended from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">allatimore</HI>-Bay in her South, unto the Bay of
<HI>Galway</HI> in her North, are about ninety miles. Her broadest part from East to West, is from <HI>Water|ford-Haven</HI>
to <HI>Feriter-Haven,</HI> and containeth an hundred miles. The whole circumference, by follow|ing
the Prometaries and indents, are above five hundred and forty miles.</P>
<P>(3) The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orm thereof is quadrant or four-square. The Air mild and temperated, neither too chil|ling
cold, nor too scorching hot. The Soil in some parts is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">illy, looking aloft with woody, wilde, and
solitary Mountains: yet the Vallies below are garnished with Corn-fields. And generally, all, both
pleasant for sight, and fertil for Soil.</P>
<P>(4) This Province is at this day divided into two parts: that is, the West-<HI>Mounster,</HI> and the South-<HI>Mounster.</HI>
The West-<HI>Mounster</HI> was inhabited in old time by the <HI>Luceni,</HI> the <HI>Velabri,</HI> and the <HI>Vte|rini:</HI>
the South-<HI>Mounster</HI> by the <HI>Oudiae</HI> or <HI>Vodiae,</HI> and the <HI>Coriondi.</HI> The <HI>Velabri</HI> and <HI>Luceni</HI> are said
(by <HI>Orosius</HI>) to have dwelt in that part of the Country, where it lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h outmost Westward, and passing
towards the <HI>Cantabrian</HI>-Ocean, looketh afar off to <HI>Gallitia</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI> The <HI>Luceni</HI> of <HI>Ireland</HI> (who
seem to have derived their name and original from the <HI>Lucensii</HI> of <HI>Gallitia,</HI> and of whom there still re|main
some Reliques in the Barony of <HI>Lyxnouw</HI>) are supposed to have been seated in those parts that
lie neighbouring upon the bank of the River <HI>Shennon.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="182">(5) The general Commodities of this Province, are Corn, Cattel, Wood, Wooll, and Fish. The
last whereof, it affords in every place, and abundance of all sorts. But none so well known for the
store of Herrings that are taken there, as is the Promontory called <HI>Eraugh,</HI> that li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s between <HI>Banire</HI>
and <HI>Ballatimore</HI> Bay, whereunto every year a great Fleet of <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> resort (even in
the midst of Winter) to fish also for Cods.</P>
<P>(6) The principal City of the Province is <HI>Limericke,</HI> which the <HI>Irish</HI> call <HI>Loumeagh,</HI> compassed
about with the famous River <HI>Shennon,</HI> by the parting of the Channel. This is a Bishops See, and the
very Mart-Town of <HI>Mounster.</HI> It wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> first won by <HI>Reymond le Grosse</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> afterwards
burnt by <HI>Duenald</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> petty King of <HI>Thuetmond.</HI> Then in process of time, <HI>Philip Breos</HI> an <HI>En|glishman</HI>
was infeoffed in it, and King <HI>Iohn</HI> fortified it with a Castle, which he caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d therein to be
built. In this Castle certain Hostages making their abode in the year 1332, grew (as is reported)
so full of pride and inconstancy, that they slew the Constable thereof, and seized the Castle into their
own hands. But the resolute Citizens, that could neither brook nor bear with such barbarous cru|elty,
did in revenge then shew such manly courage and vivacity, as they soon after recovered the
Castle again, repaying the Hostages in such hostile manner, as they put them all to the Sword
without partiality. The position of this Town is by <HI>Mercator</HI> placed for Latitude 53 degrees,
20 minutes; and for Longitude, 9 degrees 34 minutes. Near unto the River that <HI>Ptolomy</HI>
calleth <HI>Daucona,</HI> and <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> (by the alteration of some few letters) nameth <HI>Sauranus,</HI>
and <HI>Savarenus,</HI> which issueth out of <HI>Muskerey</HI> Mountains: is seated the City <HI>Corke,</HI> graced also
with another Episcopal dignity (and with the Bishops See of <HI>Clon</HI> annexed unto it) which <HI>Giraldus</HI>
calleth <HI>Corragia,</HI> the <HI>Englishmen Corke,</HI> and the native inhabitants of the Country <HI>Coreach.</HI> This Town
is so bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t on every side with neig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bouring molesters, as that they are still constrained to keep
watch and ward, as if there lay continual siege against it. The Citizens of this place are all linkt
<PB REF="182">
together in some one or other degree of affinity, for that they dare not match their daughters in
marriage into the Country, but make contracts of Matrimony one with another among themselves.
In this place, that holy and religious man <HI>Briock,</HI> is said to have his birth and breeding, who flourish|ed
among the <HI>Gaules</HI> in that fruitful age of Christianity, and from whom the Diocess of <HI>Sambrioch</HI>
in <HI>Britain Armorica,</HI> commonly called S. <HI>Brie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> had the denomination.</P>
<P>(7) The City which the <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Britains</HI> call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orthlargy,</HI> and the <HI>English, Waterford,</HI> though it
be last in place, yet is it not least in account, as being the second City in all <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well for the
convenience and commodiousness of the Haven&punc; that affords such necessary aptitude for trade and
traffique, as also for the faithful loyalty which it hath always shewed to the Imperial Crown of
<HI>England:</HI> for ever since it was won by <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> it still performed the obedience and
peaceable offices of duty and service unto the <HI>English,</HI> as they continued the course in the Con|quest
of <HI>Ireland:</HI> whence it is that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have from time to time endowed it
with many large Franchises and Liberties, which King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh did both augment and
confirm.</P>
<P>(8) Although since the time of S. <HI>Patrick,</HI> Christianity was never extinct in this Country, yet
the government being haled into contrary factions, the Nobility lawless, and the multitude wilful,
it hath come to pass, that religion hath waxed (with the temporal common sort) more cold and
feeble, being most of them very irreligious, and addicted wholly to superstitious observations: for
in some parts of this Province, some are of opinion, that certain men are yearly turned into Wolves,
and made Wolf-men. Though this hath been constantly affirmed by such as think their censures
worthy to pass for currant and credible: yet let us suppose that haply they be possessed with the
disease and malady that the Physicians call Lycanthropy, which begetteth and endange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eth such like
phantasies through the malicious humours of Melancholly: and so oftentimes men imagine them|selves
<PB REF="183">
to be turned and transformed into forms which they are not. Some again embrace another
ridiculous opinion, and perswade themselves, that he who in the barbarous acclamation and out-cry
of the Souldiers, which they use with great forcing and straining of their voices, when they joyn
battel, doth not showre and make a noise as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he rest do, is suddenly caught from the ground, and
carryed as it were fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the Air, out of any Country of <HI>Ireland,</HI> into some desert vallies, where he
feedeth upon grass, drinketh water, hath some use of reason, but not of speech, is ignorant of the
present condition he stands in, whether good or bad: yet at length shall be brought to his own home,
being c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ught with the help of Hounds and Hunters. Great pity that the foul fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd and father of dark|ness,
should so grievously seduce this people with misbelief, and that these errours be not chased a|way
with the truth of Christian Religion, whereby as they carry much grace in their countenances, they
may also not be void of the inward grace of their souls and understanding.</P>
<P>(9) This Province hath been sore wasted in the rebellions of <HI>Desmond,</HI> to whose aid Pope <HI>Gre|gory</HI>
the thirteenth, and <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> sent c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rtain companies of <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
arrived not far from <HI>Dingle,</HI> fortified themselves, and gave it the name of <HI>Fort de Ore,</HI> sounding loud
threats against the whole Country. But <HI>Arthur</HI> Baron <HI>Grey,</HI> Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> at the first on|set
decided their quarrel, by sheathing his Sword in their bowels; and <HI>Desmond</HI> fearfully flying into
the woods, was by a Souldier cut shorter by the head. And again, when the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI>
lay bleeding, and put almost to the hazard of the last cast, <HI>Don Iohn D'Aquila,</HI> with eight thousand
<HI>Spaniards</HI> (upon confidence of the excommunications of <HI>Piu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the fift, <HI>Gregory</HI> the thirteenth, and
<HI>Clemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the eight, <HI>Popes,</HI> all of them discharging their curses like unto thunderbolts against Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> of blessed memory) landed near unto <HI>Kinsale</HI> presuming that the rebellions of <HI>Tyrone</HI> had
turned the hearts of the <HI>Irish</HI> for <HI>Rome:</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Blunt</HI> Lord <HI>Mountjoy,</HI> in the depth of Winter, and
with his tired Souldiers, so daunted their <HI>Spanish</HI> hearts that with one victory he repressed their bragging
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oldness, and recovered the <HI>Irish</HI> that were ready to revolt.</P>
<P><PB REF="183">(10) God hath oftentimes shewed his tender love and affection to this people, in laying his
fatherly chastisements and afflictions upon them, sometimes by winds, sometimes by famine and
dearth, and sometimes again by opening his hand of plenty into their laps to convert them to him|self,
and to divert their hearts from superstitions. In the year 1330, about the feast of Saint <HI>Iohn
Baptist,</HI> there began such a dearth of Corn in this Country, by the abundance of rain and the inun|dation
of waters (which continued until <HI>Michaelmas</HI> following) that a Cranoc of Wheat was sold
for twenty shillings, a Cranoc of Oats for eight shillings, a Cranoc of Pease, Beans, and Barley for
as much. The winds the same year were so mighty, that many were hurt, and many slain out-right
by the fall of houses that was forced by the violence of the same. The like whereof were never seen
in <HI>Ireland.</HI> In the year 1317, there was such a dearth of Corn and other Victuals, that a Cranoc of
Wheat was sold for twenty three shillings. And many Housholders, that before time had sustained
and relieved a great number, were this year driven to beg, and many famished. In the time of which
famine, the mercy of God so disposed, that upon the <HI>27^t^h</HI> day of <HI>Iune,</HI> in the year 1331, there came
to land such a mighty multitude of great Sea-fishes (that is) <HI>Thursheds,</HI> such as in many ages p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st had
never been seen, that the people were much comforted in this distress, and received great relief and
sustenance by the same.</P>
<P>(11) Places of Religion in this Country. were the two Abbies at <HI>Toghall,</HI> calleth the <HI>North-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">b|bey</HI>
and <HI>South-Abbey:</HI> The two Abbeys at <HI>Limerick,</HI> S. <HI>Francis</HI> Abbey, and S. <HI>Dominick</HI> Abbey:
The two Abbeys at <HI>Cork,</HI> the Abbey of the Isle, and S. <HI>Frances</HI> Abbey: and the famous Abbey (in
times past) for the holy Cross which hath had many priviledges and liberties granted unto it, in ho|nour
of a piece of <HI>Christs Cross,</HI> that was (as they say) sometimes preserved there. Thus were Chri|stians
perswaded in ancient times. And it is a wonder in what Troops and Assemblies people do
(even yet) con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">low thither upon devotion, as unto a place of holiness and sanctity: so firmly are
<PB REF="184">
they setled in the Religion of their Fore-fathers, which hath been increased beyond all measure by
the negligent care of their Teachers, who should instruct their ignorance, and labour to reduce them
from the errors they persevere in.</P>
<P>This Province is governed by a Lord President&punc; who hath one assistant, twelve learned Lawyers,
and a Secretary to keep it in duty and obedience. It was in times past divided into many parts, as
<HI>Towoun,</HI> that is, <HI>North Mounster; Deswoun,</HI> that is, <HI>South Mounster; Hierwoun,</HI> that is, <HI>West Mounster;
Mean woun,</HI> that is, <HI>Middle Mounster;</HI> and <HI>Vrwoun,</HI> that is, the Front of <HI>Mounster.</HI> But at this day
it is distinguished into these Counties; <HI>Kerry, Desmond, Limerick, Tiperary, Holycross, Waterford,</HI> and
<HI>Cork</HI> which County in times past had been a Kingdom, containing with it <HI>Desmond</HI> also: for so in
the Grant given by King <HI>Henry</HI> the second unto <HI>Robert Fitz-Stephen,</HI> and to <HI>Miles de Cogan,</HI> it is
called in these words: <HI>Know ye that I have granted the whole Kingdom of</HI> Cork, <HI>excepting the City and
Cantred of the Oustmans, to hold for them and their heirs, of me and</HI> Iohn <HI>my son, by the service of sixty
Knights.</HI> The County of <HI>Waterford,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth gave unto <HI>Iohn Talbot</HI> Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI>
with the name, stile, and the title of <HI>Earl of Waterford,</HI> which was afterward again assumed to the Crown.
Touching the County of <HI>Holy Cross,</HI> as the opinion of that much frequented Abbey is much lessened,
so that County is swallowed up altogether in the County <HI>Tipperary.</HI> It is fortified with five strong
Castles, traded with six Market-Towns, and divided as followeth.

<P>THis Country, the Natives call <HI>Leighnigh,</HI> the <HI>Britains Lein;</HI> in <HI>Latine, Lagenia;</HI> in the
ancient lives of the Saints, <HI>Lagen;</HI> and in <HI>English, Leinster.</HI> It lieth Eastward along <HI>Hi|bernicum</HI>
Sea; on <HI>Connaught</HI> side Westward it is bounded with the River <HI>Shaenon;</HI> the
North with the Territory of <HI>Louth,</HI> and the South with part of the Province of <HI>Moun|ster.</HI>
This Country butteth upon <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Mounster</HI> and <HI>Conn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ught</HI> do upon <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is triangle, and sides not much unequal, from her South East unto the
West-point about 80 miles, from thence to her North-west about 70 miles, and her East Coast along
the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea-shore, eighty miles: the circumference upon two hundred and seventy miles.</P>
<P>(3) The air is clear and gentle, mixt with a temperate disposition, yielding neither extremity of
heat or cold, according to the seasonable times of the year, and the natural condition of the Continent.
The soil is generally fruitful, plentiful, both in fish and flesh, and in other victuals as butter, cheese,
and milk. It is fertil in Corn, Cattle, and pasture grounds, and would be much more, if the hus|bandman
did but apply his industry, to which he is invited by the commodiousness of the Country. It
is well watered with Rivers, and for the most part well wooded, except the County of <HI>Divelin,</HI> which
complains much of that want, being so destitute of wood, that they are compelled to use a clammy kind
of fat turff for their fuel, or Sea-coal brought out of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Inhabitants of these parts in <HI>Ptolomies</HI> days were the <HI>Brigantes, Menapii, Cauci,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lani;</HI>
from which <HI>Blani</HI> may seem to be derived and contracted the latter and modern names of this Coun|try,
<HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in, Leighnigh,</HI> and <HI>Leinster&punc;</HI> The <HI>Menapii,</HI> (as the name doth after a sort imply) came from
<PB REF="185">
the <HI>Menapians,</HI> a Nation in Low Germany, that dwelt by the Sea-Coasts. These <HI>Brigantes,</HI> called
also <HI>Brigants, Florianus del Campo</HI> (a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">paniard</HI> labours to fetch from the <HI>Brigants</HI> of his own Coun|trey,
of whom an ancient City in <HI>Spain</HI> (called <HI>Brigantia</HI>) took the name. But they may seem ra|ther
to derive their denomination from the River Birgus, about which they inhabited, for to this the
very name is almost sufficient to perswade us.</P>
<P>(5) The commodities of this Country do chiefly consist in Cattle, Sea-fowl, and Fish. It breeds
many excellent good horses, called <HI>Irish Hobbies,</HI> which have not the same pace that other horses have
in their course, but a soft and round amble, setting very easily.</P>
<P>(6)<UNCLEAR>This</UNCLEAR> Country hath in it three Rivers of note, termed in old time the three sisters, <HI>Shour, Neor,</HI>
and <HI>Batraeo&punc;</HI> which issue out of the huge Mountain (called by <HI>Giraldus, Bladinae Montes</HI>) as out of
their mothers womb, and from their rising tops descending with a downfal into several Channels, be|fore
they empty themselves into the Ocean, joyn hand in hand altogether in a mutual league and
combination.</P>
<P>(7) Places very dangerous for shipping are certain flats and shallows in the Sea, that lie over
against Holy-point, which the Mariners call the <HI>Grounds.</HI> Also the shelves of sand that lie a great
way in length opposite to <HI>Newcastl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which over looketh them into the Sea from the top of an high hill
adjoyning.</P>
<P>(8) In this Province are placed many fair and wealthy Towns, as <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> which for a Bur|rough-Town
excels all the midland Burroughs in this Island. <HI>Kildare,</HI> which is adorned with an
Episcopal See, and much graced in the first infancy of the <HI>Irish</HI> Church, by reason of Saint <HI>Brigid,</HI> a
venerable Virgin, had in great account and estimation for her virginity and devotion, as who was
the Disciple of S. <HI>Patrick</HI> of so great fame, renown, and antiquity: also <HI>Weisford</HI> (a name given
unto it by these <HI>Germans,</HI> whom the <HI>Irish</HI> term <HI>Oustmans</HI>) a Town though inferiour to some, yet as
<PB REF="186">
memorable as any, so that it became the first Colony of the <HI>English,</HI> and did first submit it self unto their
protection, being assaulted by <HI>Fitz Stephen,</HI> a Captain worthily made famous for his valour and mag|nanimity.</P>
<P>(9) But the City which fame may justly celebrate alone, beyond all the Cities or Towns in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is
that which we call <HI>Divelin, Ptolomy Eblana,</HI> the <HI>Latinists Dublinium,</HI> and <HI>Dublini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> the <HI>West-Britaines,
Dinas Dublin;</HI> the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> in times past, <HI>Duplin;</HI> and the <HI>Irish, Balacleigh,</HI> that is
the Town upon hurdles: for it is reported that the place being fennish and moorish, when it first began
to be builded, the foundation was laid upon hurdles.</P>
<P>(10) That it is ancient, is perswaded by the authority of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> That it was grievously rent and
dismembred in the tumultuous wars of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and brought afterwards under the subjection of <HI>Edgar</HI>
King of <HI>England,</HI> (which his Charter also confirmeth, wherein he calleth it the noble City of <HI>Ireland</HI>)
is written by <HI>Saxo Grammaticus.</HI> That it was built by <HI>Harold</HI> of <HI>Norway,</HI> which may seem to be
<HI>Harold Harsager,</HI> when he had brought the greatest part of <HI>Ireland</HI> into an awful obedience unto him,
we read in the life of <HI>Griffith ap Sinan</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> At length it yielded unto the valour and pro|tection
of the <HI>English,</HI> at their first arrival into <HI>Ireland,</HI> by whom it was manfully defended from the
fierce assaults as well of <HI>Auscoulph</HI> Prince of the <HI>Dublinians,</HI> as afterwards of <HI>Gotard</HI> King of the Isles:
since which time it hath still augmented her flourishing estate, and given approved testimony of
her faith, and loyalty to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> in the times of any tumultuous straights and com|motions.</P>
<P>(11) This is the Royal Seat of <HI>Ireland,</HI> strong in her munition, beautiful in her buildings, and
(for the quantity) matchable to many other Cities, frequent for traffick and intercourse of Mer|chant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.
In the East Suburbs, <HI>Henry</HI> the second, King of <HI>England</HI> (as <HI>Hoveden</HI> reporteth) caused a roy|al
Palace to be erected: and <HI>Henry Loundres,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Divelin,</HI> built a Store house about the
<PB REF="186">
year of Christ 1220. Not far from it is the beautiful Colledge consecrated unto the name of the holy
Trinity, which Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous memory dignified with the priviledges of an University.
The Church of S. <HI>Patrick</HI> being much enlarged by <HI>King Iohn,</HI> was by <HI>Iohn Comin</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Dub|lin,</HI>
born at <HI>Evesham</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> first ordained to be a Church of Prebends in the year 1191 It doth
at this day maintain a Dean, a Chanter, a Chancellor, a Treasurer, two Archdeacons, and twenty
two Prebendaries.</P>
<P>This City in times past, for the due administration of Civil Government, had a Provost for the
chief Magistrate. But in the year of mans redemption 1409, King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth granted them
liberty to chuse every year a Major and two Bailiffes, and that the Major should have a gilt sword
carried before him for ever. And King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth (to heap more honour upon this place)
changed the two Bailiffs afterwards into Sherif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s: so that there is not any thing here wanting that may
serve to make the estate of a City most flourishing.</P>
<P>(12) As the people of this Country do about the neighbouring parts of <HI>Divelin</HI> come nearest unto
the civil conditions and orderly subjection of the <HI>English:</HI> so in places farther off they are more tu|multuous,
being at deadly feuds amongst themselves, committing oft-times Man slaughter one upon
another, and working their own mischiefs by mutual wrongs: for so the <HI>Irish</HI> of <HI>Leinster wasted Lein|ster</HI>
with many Towns in the same Province in the year 1294. And in the year 1301, the men of <HI>Lein|ster</HI>
in like manner raised a war in the winter season, setting on fire the Town of <HI>Wykinlo, Rathdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and
others, working their own plague and punishment by burning up their sustenance, and losing their Ca|stle
by depr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dation.</P>
<P>(13) Matter of observation, and no less admiration among them, is the Giants dance, commonly
so called, and so much talked of, which <HI>Merlin</HI> is said by Art of Magick to have translated out of this
Territory unto <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, which how true it is, I leave to the vain believers of miracles, and to
the credulous observers of antiquity.</P>
<P><PB REF="187">(14) In this County have been erected many famous Monasteries, Abbeys, and religious houses,
consecrated to devout and holy purposes: As the Monastery of Saint <HI>Maries</HI> of <HI>Oustmanby,</HI> founded
for preaching Fryers, unto which of late daies the Iudicial Courts of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">: Kingdom have been translated:
also the magnificent Abbey called S. <HI>Thomas</HI> Court at <HI>Dublin,</HI> builded and endowed in times past
with many large priviledges and revenues of King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, in expiation of the murther of
<HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> Likewise <HI>Teniern</HI> Monastery, or the notable Abbey which <HI>William
Marshall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrooke</HI> founded, and called <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">voto,</HI> for that he had vowed to God (being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ossed
at Sea with many a sore and dangerous tempest) to errect an Abbey wheresoever he came to land, and
being (after shipwrack) cast upon land in this place, he made performance of his vow accordingly.</P>
<P>This Province containeth the Counties of <HI>Kilkenny, Caterlough, Queens County, Kings County, Kil|dare,

<HEAD>CHAPTER IIII.</HEAD>
<P>THis Province named by <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis, Conachtia;</HI> and <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">acia:</HI> by the <HI>Irish Con|aughty,</HI>
and by <HI>English-men, Connaught:</HI> is bounded East-ward, with part of the
County of <HI>Leinster;</HI> North-ward, with part of <HI>Vlster;</HI> West-ward, with the West-main Ocean, and on the South, it is confined with a part of the Province of <HI>Mounster,</HI>
closed in with the River <HI>Shennon,</HI> and butting against the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI></P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is long, and towards the North and South ends, thin and narrow: but as it
grows towards the middle, from either part it waxeth still bigger and bigger: extending in length
from the River <HI>Shennon</HI> in her South, to <HI>Enis Kelling</HI> in her North, 126 miles; and the broadest part
is from <HI>Tromer</HI> in her East, to <HI>Barragh Bay</HI> in her West, containing about fourscore miles. The whole
in circuit and compass is above four hundred miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Air is not altogether so pure and clear, as in the other Provinces of <HI>Ireland</HI> by reason of
certain most places (covered over with grass) which for their softness are usually termed Boghes, both
dangerous, and full of vaporous and foggy mists.</P>
<P>(4) This County as it is divided into several portions, so is every portion severally commended for
the soile, according to the seasonable times of the year to <HI>Twomond</HI> or the County <HI>Clare,</HI> is said to be a
Country so conveniently situated, that either from the Sea or Soil there can be nothing wisht for
more, than what it doth naturally afford of it self, were but the industry of the Inhabitants answera|ble
to the rest. <HI>Galway</HI> is a land very thankful to the painful husbandman, and no less commodious
and profitable to the Shepherd. <HI>Maio,</HI> in the <HI>Roman Provincial</HI> called <HI>Mageo,</HI> is replenished both
<PB REF="188">
with pleasure and fertility abundantly rich in Cattel, Deer, Hawks, and plenty of Honey. <HI>Slego</HI> (coast|ing
up the Sea) is a plenteous Country for feeding and raising of Cattel. <HI>Le-Trim</HI> (a place rising
up throughout with hills) is so full of rank grass and forrage, that (as <HI>Solinus</HI> reporteth) if Cattel
were not kept sometimes from grazing&punc; their fulness would endanger them. And <HI>Roscomen</HI> is a Terri|tory,
for the most part plain and fruitfull, feeding many Herds of Cattle, and with mean husban|dry
and tillage, yielding plenty of Corn. As every particular part is thus severally profitab<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">e be in-bred
commodities: so is it no less commended (in the generality) for the many accommodate and fit Baies,
Creeks, and navigable Rivers, lying upon her Sea-Coasts, that after a sort invite and provoke the In|habitants
to Navigation.</P>
<P>(5) Such as in ancient time made their abode and habitations in this Province, were the GAN|GANI,
who were also called CONCANI, AUTERI, and NAGNATAE. As the <HI>Luceni</HI>
(that were next neighbours unto them) came from the <HI>Lucensii</HI> (in <HI>Spain</HI>) so those <HI>Gangani</HI> and <HI>Con|cani</HI>
may seem also to have fetcht their derivation from the <HI>Concani</HI> (a Nation of the self-same Country)
both by the affinity of name, and vicinity of place. In <HI>Strabo,</HI> according to the diversity of reading,
the same people are named <HI>Coniaci</HI> and <HI>Conisci:</HI> and <HI>Silius</HI> testifieth them at the first to have been
<HI>Scythians,</HI> and to have used ordinarily to drink horses bloud (a thing nothing strange among the wild
Irish even of late days.) And some may also haply suppose that the <HI>Irish</HI> name <HI>Conaughty,</HI> was com|pounded
of <HI>Concani</HI> and <HI>Nagnatae.</HI> Howsoever, it is sure that these were the ancient inhabitants of
this Country, as is to be seen in <HI>Ptolomy.</HI></P>
<P>(6) The Principal City of this Province, and which may worthily be accounted the third in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> is <HI>Galway,</HI> in <HI>Irish, Gallive,</HI> built in manner much like to a Tower. It is dignified with a Bi|shops
See, and it is much frequented with Merchants, by reason whereof, and the benefit of the
Road and Haven, it is gainful to the Inhabitants through traffique and exchange of rich commodities,
<PB REF="189">
both by Sea and Land. Not far from which, near the West shoar that lies indented with small in-lets
and out-lets, in a row, are the Islands called <HI>Arran,</HI> of which many a foolish fable goes, as if they were
the Islands of the living, wherein none died at any time, or were subject to mortality; which is as
superstitious an observation, as that used in some other corners of the Country, where the people leave
the right Arms of their Infants males unchristned (as they term it) to the end that at any time after|wards,
they might give a more deadly and ungracious blow when they strike&punc; which things do not only
shew how palpable they are carried away by traditious obscurities, but do also intimate how full their
hearts be of inveterate revenge.</P>
<P>(7) This Province presents no matter more worthy of memory, than the battel of <HI>Knock-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI>
(that is) <HI>The hill of Axes,</HI> under which the greatest rabble of Rebbels, that were ever seen before
in <HI>Ireland</HI> (raised and gathered together by the Arch-Rebbels of that time, <HI>William Burk O Brien, Mac-Nenare,</HI>
and <HI>O Carrol</HI>) were after a bloudy overthrow discomfited and put to flight by the noble
service of <HI>Girald Fitz-Girald</HI> Earl of <HI>Kildare.</HI> And the suppression of certain <HI>Irish</HI> (the posterity of
<HI>Mac-William</HI>) who usurping a tyranny in these parts, raged sometimes upon themselves, with mu|tual
injuries, and oppressed the poor people a long time with extorting, pilling and spoiling; so as
they left scarce one house in the Country unrifled, or unrased; but were bridled and repressed (even
in our remembrance) by the severity and resolution of the Commissioners of those times, who
in his wisdom and pollicy well understood, that their excessive insolence, and those their un|just
doings, would be a means to draw the people away from the due obedience to their Prince:
such therefore as refused to obey the Laws, and sided with the tumultuous, with all care and dili|gence
he soon scattered, forcing their Forts, and driving them into woods and lurking holes (for
troubling the blessed estate of tranquility) till the Lord Deputy, who took pity of them, upon
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> humble supplication, commanded by his missives, that they should be received upon term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

of peace. But they being a stiff-necked people, took Arms again, entred a-fresh into actual re|bellion,
dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e away booties, made soul uproars, and upon fair promises procured the aid of the
<HI>Scottish Islanders,</HI> from out of the <HI>Hebrides</HI> whereupon the Governour assembled an Army, and pur|sued
them with such powerful violence through the Woods and Forrests, that after six or seven weeks,
being grievously hunger-bitten, they submitted themselves in all humility. The Auxiliary forces also
of the <HI>Scots</HI> he by day and night affronted so near, and followed so hardly, that he put them to flight,
after he had killed and drowned about three thousand of them in the River <HI>Moin.</HI></P>
<P>(8) About the year 1316, there was such a great slaughter made of the <HI>Irish</HI> in this Province of
<HI>Connaught,</HI> through a quarrel that rose there between two Lords or Princes, that there were slain on
both sides about four thousand men; and so great a tribulation at that time came upon the people,
that they did devour and eat one another, so as of 10000, there remained not above 300 living.
As it is reported for truth, that the people were then so hunger-starved, that in Church-yards they
took the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ad bodies out of their graves, and in their sculls boyled the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sh, and fed upon it: yea,
and that women did eat their own Children. Thus appeared the ire and anger of God, in punishing
their sins, and seeking their conversion.</P>
<P>(9) Places memorable, are <HI>Iuis Ceath,</HI> well known by the Monastery of <HI>Colman</HI> (a devout Saint
founded for <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Englishmen;</HI> and <HI>Inis Bovind,</HI> which <HI>Beda</HI> calleth, <HI>White Calfe lsle.</HI> Also <HI>Maio,</HI>

Islands,</HI> which are called the Hebrides, and are scattered in the Seas between both Kingdomes; whose
Inhabitants at this day is the <HI>Irish Scot,</HI> Successour of the old Scythian.</P>
<P>(2) The form thereof is round, reaching in length from <HI>Coldagh</HI> Haven in the North to <HI>Kilmore</HI>
in her South, near an hundred miles; and in breadth from <HI>Black-Abbey</HI> in her East, to <HI>Calebegh</HI> point
in her West, one hundred thirty and odd miles: The whole in circumference, about four hundred and
twenty miles.</P>
<P>(3) This Country seldom feeleth any unseasonable extremities, the quick and flexible Winds cool|ing
the heat of Summer, and soft and gentle Showers mollifie the hardness of the Winter. Briefly,
the frozen nor torrid Zone have not here any usurpation; the clouds in the air very sweet and plea|sant,
yea, and when they are most impure, are not unwholsome, nor of long continuance, the rough
winds holding them in continual agitation.</P>
<P>(4) This equal temperature causeth the ground to bring forth great store of several Trees, both fit
for building&punc; and bearing of fruit; plentiful of Grass for the feeding of Cattel, and is abundantly
furnished with Horses, Sheep, and Oxen; the Rivers likewise pay double tribute, deep enough to carry
Vessels either for pleasure or profit, and Fish great store, both for their own uses, and commodity of

others. <HI>Salmon</HI> in some Rivers of this County abound more in number than in any River of <HI>Europe.</HI>
To speak (in general) though in some places it be somewhat barren, troubled with Loughs, Lakes, and
thick Woods, yet it is every where fresh, and full of Cattel and Forrage, ready at all times to answer
the husbandmans pains. But nature is there so little beholding to Art or Industry, that the various
shew upon Banks, the Shady Groves, the Green Meadows, hanging Hills, and fields fit for Corn, (if
they were manured) do seem to be angry with their Inhabitants for suffering all to grow wild and

<P>(6) The people of this Province were accustomed in controversies and solemn protestations to

and sitting in the Caldron wherein it was sod, accompanied with his people round about him, he and
they used to eat the flesh and drink the broath wherein he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ate, without cup, or dish, or use of hand.
How far these prescriptions and customes were different from the conformities of other civil Monar|chies,
we may well perceive by these and other like observations of those gross times: and as yet they
are more barbarous than is any other part of the Island besides.</P>
<P>(7) Historians relating of <HI>Ireland,</HI> tell of several Islands in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he several Provinces: some full of
Angels, some full of Devils; some for Male only, some for Female; some where none may live; some
where none can dye; and such effects of trees, stones, and waters, that a man (but of easie conceit)
may well esteem them as heedless as uncertain. So also S. <HI>Patrieks</HI> Purgatory (a thing of much note
in the Tract of this Province) is a vault or narrow cave in the ground, near a Lake (called <HI>Ern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="192">
Liffer&punc;</HI>) much spoken of, by reason of (I wot not what) fearful walking spirits and dreadful appariti|ons,
or rather some religious horror) which (as some ridiculously dream) was digg'd by <HI>Vlysses</HI> when
he went down to parely with those in hell. This is the Cave which the Inhabitants in these dayes call
<HI>Ellan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rugadory,</HI> that is, <HI>The Isle of Purgatory,</HI> and S. <HI>Patricks Purgatory;</HI> for some persons, less de|vout
than credulous, affirm that S. <HI>Patrick</HI> (or rather <HI>Patricius Secundus,</HI> an holy Abbot of that name)
labouring the conversion of the people of this Province, and much inforcing the life to come, they re|plyed
contemptuously unto him, that unless they saw proofs of those joyes and pains he preached, they
would not lose the possession of their present pleasures, in hope or fear of things to come, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
not when. Whereupon (as they say) he obtained at Gods hands by earnest prayer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the punish|ments
and torments which the godles&punc; are to suffer after this life, might be there presented to the eye,
that so he might more easily root out the sins and Heathenish Errours, that stuck so fast in the hearts of
the <HI>Irish.</HI> But touching the credit hereof (although common fame, and some records do utter it) I
neither will urge the beliefe, nor regard, seeing it is no Article of our Creed.</P>
<P>(8) Matters memorable within this Province are these: first, that the Bishops of <HI>Ireland</HI> were
wont to be consecrated by the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in regard of the Primacy which they had in
this Country, until such time as <HI>Iohn Papirio</HI> a Cardinal was sent thither from Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> the
fourth, to reform Ecclesiastical Discipline in this Island, which was then grown so loose, that there were
Translations and Pluralities of Bishops, according to the will and pleasure of the Metropolitan. Also
that the <HI>Irish men</HI> were accustomed to leave and forsake their wedded Wives at their own free-wills,
whereof <HI>Lanfranck</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> complained unto <HI>Therdeluac</HI> a King of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And
had not this Nation been corrupted with this vice, even unto these our days; both the right of lineal
succession had been more certain among them, and the Gentry and Commonalty had not in such cruel|ties
imbrued themselves, with such effusion of their own kindreds blood, about their Inheritances and
legitimation.</P>
<P><PB REF="192">(9) The principal Town in this Tract is <HI>Armagh,</HI> near unto the River <HI>Kalin,</HI> which (albeit it ma|keth
a poor shew) is the <HI>Archiepiscopal See</HI> and <HI>Metropolitane</HI> of the whole Island. Before Saint <HI>Pa|trick</HI>
had built there a fair City, for site, form, quantity, and compass, modelled out (as he saith) by
the appointment and direction of Angels, this place was named <HI>Drumsalrich;</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> tell much that
it received the name of Queen <HI>Armacha:</HI> but the better opinions are, that it is the same which <HI>Beda</HI>
calleth <HI>Dearmach,</HI> and out of the <HI>Scottish</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Language interpreteth it, <HI>The Field of Oaks.</HI> Here
(as S. <HI>Bernard</HI> writeth) S. <HI>Patrick</HI> the Apostle of <HI>Ireland</HI> ruled in his life time, and rested after death: in
honour of whom it was of such venerable estimation in old time, that not only Bishops and Priests, but
Kings also and Princes were (in general) subject to the Metropolitan thereof in all obedience, and to
his government alone. Among the Archbishops of this Province, S. <HI>Malachy</HI> is famoused, who first
prohibited Priests marriage in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and (as S. <HI>Bernard</HI> saith, who wrote his life at large) borrowed
no more of the native barbarousnes of that County, than Sea-fishes do saltness of the Seas. Also
<HI>Richard Fitz-Ralph</HI> (commonly called <HI>Armachanus</HI>) is of famous memory, who turned the edge of his
style, about the year 1355, began to oppose his opinion against the order of <HI>Mendicant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ryers,</HI> as de|testing
in Christians such voluntary begging. The chief Fort in this Tract is <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">is K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lling,</HI> defended by
the Rebels in the year 1593, and won by <HI>Dowdal</HI> a most valiant Captain: near unto which is a great
downfall of water, termed, <HI>The Salmon Leap:</HI> of which there is a common Speech currant among the
Inhabitants, that it was once firm ground, very populous, and well husbanded with tillage; till it
was suddenly over-flown with water, and turned into a Lake, for some filthy abominable acts of the
people against Nature committed with Beasts.</P>
<P>(10) The places of Religion, sequestred from other worldly services, and consecrated to holy pur|poses,
erected in this province, were, The Abbey which sheweth it self at <HI>Donegal:</HI> The Monastery
of <HI>Deryo,</HI> where the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebel <HI>Shan O Neal</HI> received such an overthrow (by <HI>Edward Randolph,</HI>
<PB REF="193">
renowned for his service in the behalf of his Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ntry) that he could never after recover the loss he
sustained at that time: The Monastery near unto the River <HI>Liffer:</HI> The famous Monastery at the Bay
of <HI>Knockfergus,</HI> of the same institution, name and order, as was that ancient Abbey in <HI>England,</HI>
near unto <HI>Chester,</HI> called <HI>Banchor:</HI> also <HI>Mellifont</HI> Abbey, founded by <HI>Donald</HI> a King of <HI>Vriel,</HI> and
much commended by S. <HI>Bernard:</HI> And lastly, the most renowned Monastery, built at <HI>Armagh</HI> in the
year of our Salvation 610, out of which very many Monasteries were afterwards propagated both in
<HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> These places were far and near frequented and sought unto by great confluences
of <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> till Time proved their devotions to be erronious, and the pure light of the word revealed,
opening the eyes of their understanding, hath taught them to shake off the shame of such Superstitions,</P>
<P>(11) That the people of this County might be kept within the bounds of their duty, this Province
hath been secured with fifty six Castles and Forts; and for trade of commerce, nine Narket-Towns
appointed, being divided into these Counties ensuing:

<HEAD>The General Description of the WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>_HEaven was too long a reach for Man to recover at one step: And therefore God first
placed him upon the earth, that he might for a time contemplate upon his inferiour
works, magnifie in them his Creator; and receive here a hope of a fuller bliss, which by
degrees he should at last enjoy in his place of rest. For this end was the lower World
created in the beginning out of a rude Mass, which before had no Form. And that
it might be made habitable, the Lord separated the dry Land from the Waters upon the third day.
Yet so as still they make but one Globe, whose center is the same with the middle World; and is the
Point and Rest as it were of all heavy Bodies, which naturally apply themselves to it: and there are sup|ported
by their own weight and equal poise.</P>
<P>(2) It hath seemed incredible (to such as measure the Wonders of God by Mans Wisdom) that this
m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">ssie part of the World should subsist by it self, not bo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">n up by any outward Prop, encompast only
with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and fleetingAir, such as can neither help to sustain nor r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">sist the fall, cou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">d the earth be
moved from her duce place. But the wonder will ce<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters">e if we remember that the <HI>Lord sitteth upon the
<UNCLEAR>circle</UNCLEAR> of the earth&punc;</HI> Isa. 40. <HI>He set it upon her foundations so that it shall never move. He covered it with
the Deep as much a Garment. The Waters would stand above the Mountains, but at his rebuke they fled.
Yet he set them a bound which they should not pass</HI></P>
<P>(3) Thus ordered by Divine Providence the Earth&punc; and Sea composed themselves into a Spherical
<PB N="3" REF="196">
Figure, as is here described. And is caused by the proper inclination of each part, which being heavy,
falls from ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> point of the Circumference, and claps about the center: there settles as near as it may
towards his place of rest. We may illustrate both the figure and situation by a familiar similitude, to an
ingenious apprehension. Suppose we a knot to be knit in the midst of a cord that hath many ends: and
those to be delivered to sundry men of equal strength, to be drawn several ways round from every
part, above and below, and on each side; questionless whilest every man draws in the boes of the
knot, it must needs become round: and whilest they continue to pluck with equal strength, it must
rest immoveable in the middle betwixt them: since every strength that would destory, hath a strength
equal to resist it. So it is in the bosom of the earth, where every part meets upon equal priviledge of
na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ure; nor can any press farther than the center, to destroy this compacted figure: for it must meet
there with a body that will oppose it. Or if not, yet could it not pass, since every motion from the
middle were to ascend, which Nature will not permit in a body of weight, as the earth is.</P>
<P>(4) Now though in a Sphere every cross line, which way soever drawn, if it run through the mid|dle,
must needs be of equal quantity, and therefore admits no difference of length or bredth: yet
the Geographers for their purpose have conceived (and but conceived) a Longitude and Latitude up|on
the earth. The Longitude they reckon from the first <HI>Meridian</HI> in the <HI>Azores,</HI> and so Eastward
round number the degrees upon the <HI>Aequator:</HI> The Latitude from the <HI>Aequator</HI> to each Pole, and num|ber
the degrees upon the outward Meridional circle. This inkling may suffice to instruct the ignorant in
the search of any place that shall be hereafter mentioned in my Discourse.</P>
<P>(5) The compass of the whole is cast by our latest and most learned to be 21600 <HI>English</HI> miles:
which though none ever yet so paced, as to measure them by the foot: yet let not the ignorant reject
this account, since the rule by which they are led cannot fail. For we see by continual experience, that
the Sun for every degree in the Heavens gains 60 miles upon the earth towards his circuit round: and
<PB N="4" REF="197">
after 360 degrees returneth to the same point in respect of us as before it was. Repeat the number of
sixty so oft, and you will find the account just. And so by proportion of the circumference to the Dia|meter
(which is <HI>tripl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">squi septim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the same which 22 hath to 7) we may judge likewise of the earths
thickness to the Center. The whole Diameter must (by rule) be somewhat lesser than a third part of
the circuit: that in proportion to 21600 will be 6872: half the number will reach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the middle of the
world, and that is 3436. In this report both of the quantity and form of the earth, we must not re|quire
such exactness as cannot vary a hairs bredth: for we see the mountains of the earth, and of|tentimes
the waves of the Sea make the superficies unequal. It will be sufficient, if there be no diffe|rence
sensible to be reckoned in so great a bulk. for let us rudely hew a ball out of rough stone; still
it is a ball, though not so smooth as one of Crystal: Or suffer a mote to fall upon a Sphere of glass, it
changeth not its figure: far less are the mountains which we see in respect of the whole lump. For
other rules or terms Geographical, I refer them to a peculiar tract, that will afford me more room
and time.</P>
<P>(6) When the Earth and Sea were thus prepared with a due figure, a just quantity and convenient
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eat both in respect of the Heavens and themselves: Nature began (at command of the most High) to
use her Art, and to make it a fit dwelling place for the Image of God, for so was man created, and so
indeed was the Earth no other than the picture of Heaven. The ground brought forth her plants and
fruits: the Skies were filled with the Fowl of the Air: the waters yielded their fish, and the fields
their Cattel. No sooner his house was thus finish't, but man enters upon his possession the sixth day.
And that shall be our tract to find out the worlds first Inhabitants; where it was peopled in the be|ginning:
and how it was over-spread with Countries and Nations, as now it is.</P>
<P>(7) In the first Age, there was little need of skill to measure the whole Earth. A garden plot
might suffice, and so (for a time) it did. It was planted in <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n:</HI> But where that was, I may not pe|remptorily
<PB N="5" REF="197">
determine, nor indeed dare I be so curious in the search. <HI>The hidden things belong to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Lord, the revealed to us,</HI> Deut. 29. God himself in the beginning set a <HI>Cherubion,</HI> and the blade of a
sword shaken to keep the re-entry from our first parents; and we may affirm, hath concealed it ever
since. Yet to satisfie (in some measure) such as are more inquisitive, I will touch at the several conje|ctures,
which hath passed upon the place of this earthly <HI>Paradise. Rog. Higd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> Monk of <HI>Chester,</HI> and
with him <HI>Iohn Trevisa</HI> set it in the field of <HI>Damascus:</HI> and many others (probably enough) have thought
it was in the Land of <HI>Canaan:</HI> for that in divers places, it is noted with attributes proper to the gar|den
of <HI>Eden. She was seated in the midst of Nations&punc;</HI> Ezek. 5. <HI>It was a Land of Wheat, Barley and Vines,
Fig-trees and Pomgranates, a Land of Olives and Honey, a Land whose stones were Iron, and out of whose
hills might be digged brass,</HI> Deut. 8. <HI>She was pleasant above all Lands,</HI> Ezek. 20. Yet <HI>Franciscus Iunius,</HI>
D. <HI>Willet,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> and others, make it a part of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> North-west from <HI>Babylon,</HI> about
the degrees of 78 in Longitude, and of Latitude 35, where still the Rivers meet, mentioned in <HI>Genesis</HI>
and where <HI>Ptolemy</HI> hath his <HI>Audanites,</HI> a corrupt name, (as is supposed) from <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</HI> Certainly it was
about the middle of the Earth, and abounded by a peculiar blessing of God, with all kinds serviceable
for the use of man.</P>
<P>(8) But <HI>Adam</HI> soon lost this possession by his disobedience, and was cast out on the East-side of
the garden, where he placed himself. <HI>Moses</HI> makes no more particular relation. <HI>Cain</HI> is specified to
have gone out of the presence of the Lord into the Land of <HI>Nod,</HI> and there built him a City, and na|med
it after his sons name <HI>Henoch:</HI> this was the first City, and was seated (some thing) about <HI>Mount
Libanus.</HI> As the place, so the time when it was found is uncertain: but the common conjecture
gives it to be about 2 or 3 hundred years after the Creation, when the world was replenished: as well
it might be within that compass, if we compare it to our known stories. <HI>Abraham</HI> in 215 years had
600 thousand of his own stock, in the blessed line, besides women and children. And in this num|ber
<PB N="6" REF="198">
we omit his other seed, of whom came twelve Princes. Questionless after this proportion the
people multiplied in the beginning, and so for 1656 years forward, and that must needs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> a large
portion of the earth, most likely those parts of <HI>Asia</HI> that lay nearest to their first seat. For they wan|dred
no farther than necessity of room compelled them.</P>
<P>(9) But now as man, so the sin of man was grown to a height. For this the wrath of God fell
upon them in a flood, that destroyed the whole earth saving eight persons, <HI>Noah</HI> and his family, who
were commanded into an <HI>Ark</HI> built by Gods own direction, and is held to have been the pattern for all
Ships to all posterity.</P>
<P>(10) When the anger of the Lord was ceased, and the waters abated, after 150 days float the <HI>Ark</HI>
rested upon the Mountains of <HI>Arrarat</HI> in <HI>Armenia.</HI> They are supposed by most to be the same which
<HI>Ptolomy</HI> calleth <HI>Montes Cordios,</HI> about the degree in 75 Longitude, and in Latitude 39. Master <HI>Cart|wright,</HI>
a Traveller of our own Nation, reports himself an eye-witness of many ancient and ruinous
foundations there, which the inhabitants have believed through all ages to be the work of those first peo|ple,
that for a long time durst not adventure into the lower Countries for fear of another flood.</P>
<P>(11) But God blessed the remnant which he had preserved; and when he had given them the Rain|bow
for a sign of his mercy, that he would no more break up the fountains of the great deep, nor open
the windows of heaven upon them to root out all flesh, by degrees they descended from the hills East|ward,
and seated themselves upon a plain in the Land of <HI>Shinar.</HI> This was the lower part of <HI>Mesopo|tamia</HI>
which compassed <HI>Chaldea</HI> and <HI>Babylonia,</HI> lying under the Mount <HI>Singara,</HI> a hill neer the degrees
of 77 in Longitude, and of Latitude 36, and stands in the direct way from <HI>Arrarat</HI> or the <HI>Moutes
Cordios</HI> towards <HI>Baby<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">on.</HI></P>
<P>(12) There when their number increased, and they forced still to seek new Colonies, they were
ambitious to leave a name behind them for posterity, and therefore adventured upon a building whose
<PB N="7" REF="198">
top should reach Heaven: and so indeed in did; for it fetcht from thence Gods second vengeance. He
confounded their speech, that they no longer understood one the other. Thus they were broke off from
their impious attempt, and scattered upon all the earth (about an hundred years after the Floud) into
seventy two several Nations, as some have punctually numbred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hem</P>
<P>(13) Whether <HI>Noah</HI> himself were present or to what place he removed, is uncertain. He had yet
two hundred and fifty years to live, and is thought to have had his habitation in <HI>Phenicia,</HI> North-ward
from <HI>Palestine</HI> about the degree of 66, and 33.</P>
<P>(14) His Sons, <HI>Sem, Ham,</HI> and <HI>Iapheth,</HI> possest their several Provinces of the World. From
<HI>Iapheth</HI> came the Isles of the Gentiles, of which we are a part, to him <HI>Europe</HI> is by most allotted. <HI>Sem</HI>
not guilty questionless of that proud enterprise, rested himself in the land of <HI>Canaa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which he knew
as it was revealed to <HI>Abraham,</HI> should be given to his posterity. Yet part of his issue (the Sons of <HI>Iock|tan)</HI>
were divided and lived remote toward the East. To him was <HI>Asia.</HI> But <HI>Cham</HI> by his fathers curse,
for discovering his nakedness, roved to the utmost parts of the earth, and peopled with his Progeny
especially those Countries which are most toucht in Histories for Barbarism and Idolatry. As indeed
how could it otherwise be? since himself had lost his father that should instruct him: and therefore
could deliver no precepts to his children, but left every one to his own inventions. And those that at

<P>(15) <HI>America</HI> too doubtless had her portion in the division, though not so soon or so immediate, but

from the River <HI>Cephew</HI> to <HI>Ieria,</HI> which is now called the East or <HI>Portugal Indies.</HI> Indeed many of
those Eastern Regions are noted to bear the name as yet of <HI>Iocktans</HI> sons. The <HI>Shabeans</HI> found as if
they had <HI>Sheba</HI> to their Father. And from <HI>Havilah</HI> is a Country in <HI>Ieria,</HI> From <HI>Shaphira, Iosephus</HI> de|rives
<HI>Ophir;</HI> both of especial fame for their plenty of Gold. But it is Doctor <HI>Willets</HI> opinion that <HI>Ophir</HI>
was rather the same Region in the <HI>West Indies</HI> which is now called <HI>Peru.</HI> To say truth we have little
certainity of the first Inhabitants which were seated in <HI>America,</HI> or the Parts of <HI>Asia</HI> near about her:
whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ey were so long since known I must doubt. For the bestowing of <HI>Iocktan,</HI> and his sons, it
was toward the East from <HI>Mesha</HI> to <HI>Sephar:</HI> but where those are, Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> confesseth himself at
a stand. And for my part I will travel no farther in these hidden Mysteries, than I find a path beaten
before me.</P>
<P>(16) This may satisfie the ingenuous, that I have (as far as I might in this little room) trac't the
first Nations from their first Founders which they had in the beginning. But to draw the direct line of
every people mixt as they now are, I think a work impossible; to me I am sure it is. For besides our se|veral
translations and promiscuous commerce, that puzzle us in the knowledge of our selves: we have
of late found, and as yet are in search of a new people, that know not their own Original, nor have we
any means to examin it, but conjectural, such as may fail. To <HI>Moses</HI> time the Scripture affordeth us
a certain truth for as many as he mentioneth, and since we have some light from such as have laboured
in the search of Antiquities. The Families (as <HI>Iosephus</HI> gives time) are truly and curiously brancht
forth and placed among the Genealogies before our Bible of the last Translation, by our well-deserving
Countrey-man Mr. <HI>Iohn Speed.</HI></P>
<P>(17) Thus far it was requisite we should know at large the growth of the world from the begin|ning;
and how the whole earth, which at first knew but one Land-lord, hath been since rent into seve|ral
parcels, which Kings and Nations call their own, and maintain their claim by force of Arms. This
<PB N="9" REF="199">
little compass will not admit a more particular relation of their affairs. For that I must refer my Rea|der
to their Historians: and now desce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d to the Geographical Description and division of the world,
as in after Ages it was found by our first Artists, and hath been since more at large discovered by the
experience of our later Travellers.</P>
<P>(18) And in this we may still observe our method. For questionless by the same degrees almost
as it was inhabited, so it grew into the knowledge of our ancient Geographers. And therefore our first
Authors in this Science bounded their Descriptions within a less compass, and divided the world in|to
those three parts only, which you see lie closest about the point of the earth, where the first men,
first Religion, first City, first Empire, and first Arts were. For in <HI>Prolomy</HI>'s time (about an hundred
and forty years after Christ) we hear not of either Land or Sea known more than was contained in
<HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>(19) And of that he never knew the East and North parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> nor the South of <HI>Africa,</HI> no
nor the most Northerly parts of <HI>Europe:</HI> but placed the end of the world that way in <HI>Vltima thule,</HI>
about sixty three degrees from the <HI>Aequator.</HI> And Southward the other way not above 17 degrees,

far short; yet le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t they just half to the search of their posterity. For they placed their first Meridian
in the <HI>Fortunate Islands,</HI> and ended their reckoning in Region <HI>Sinarum</HI> of the Eastern <HI>Indies,</HI> and that
is distant but 180 degrees toward the 360, which is the compass of the whole.</P>
<P>(20) But God in these later times hath enlarged our possessions, that his Gospel might be pro|pagated,
and hath discovered to us Inhabitants almost in every corner of the earth. Our later Geo|graphers
have set their mark beyond <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s 60 degrees Eastward. And Westward to the utmost

<HEAD>The Description of ASIA.</HEAD>
<P>THe method propounded in our general Description of the World, gives <HI>Asia</HI> the preroga|tive

will suffice her, if she be at this day most famous for the acts of men, and so it is allow|ed
by most. But in <HI>Asia</HI> did God himself speak his miraculous work of the Creation.
There was the Church first collected: there was the Saviour of the World born, cruci|fied,
and raised again: indeed the greatest part of Divine History was there written and acted. And
if we should as well compare her to the rest, in that earthly glory of Kingdoms, Empires and Nations,
which sounds fairest to mans sense, she would still keep her rank. For was not the first Monarchs and
Monarchies of the World in <HI>Assyria, Persia, Babylonia, Media?</HI> Did not the first People of the World
receive their Being in <HI>Mesopotamia?</HI> And had not the several Tongues of the World their original in

Consider that Gods hand is now upon her, and the rest will follow without much wonder.</P>
<P>(2) In respect of both <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> it is situated Eastward. But if we compare it to the <HI>Aequa|tor</HI>
it lieth almost wholly in the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rthern Henisphere: I need except none of the main Continent,
only a few Islands, which are as it were, retainers to <HI>Asia,</HI> and lie partly Southward beyond the Line.
It is divided on the West from <HI>Europe</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> the River <HI>Tanais, Pontus Euxinus,</HI> and part of the <HI>Mediter|raneum</HI>

is called <HI>Pontus</HI> River, on the North, <HI>Mare Scithicum,</HI> the <HI>Tartarean</HI> Sea, and in the South the <HI>Indian</HI>

Aeolis Phrygia, (5) Lydia, (6) Minor, (7)</HI> and <HI>Major.</HI> The other hath no one name as I find among

Armenia minor.</HI></P>
<P>(9) <HI>Asia propria</HI> was the scene of many noble actions much celebrated among our Historians. First,
in <HI>Caria</HI> stood the City <HI>Mindum,</HI> upon which <HI>Diogenes</HI> brake his Iest, That the Citizens should take
heed lest it run out at her Gates And <HI>Halicarnassus</HI> the birth place of <HI>Dyonisius</HI> and <HI>Herodotus:</HI> and
of this was <HI>Artemisia</HI> Queen, that erected the miraculus Monument in honour of her Husband <HI>Mau|solus.</HI>
The second Province is <HI>Ionia&punc;</HI> and here stood <HI>Miletum,</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> made his Oration to the El|ders
of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> and here <HI>Ephesus</HI> it self, the Star of <HI>Asia,</HI> that as well for her Religion as her mi|raculous
Temple, set the World at a gaze upon her. It was raised in the middle of the City, modelled
out by <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> but was 220 years in building; and was ordered in such a ground, that no Earth-quake
should move it: it was 425 foot long, and 220 broad, and had an hundred twenty seven Pillars, given
by so many several Kings (saith <HI>Vadianus</HI>) whereof twenty seven were most curiously graven, all the
rest of Marble polished. In this City Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> the Evangelist is said to have gone down into his
Grave alive: there be who yet question his Death: and <HI>Irenaeus</HI> reports that he lived in <HI>Trajans</HI>
time. This with the third and fourth Provinces of <HI>Doris</HI> and <HI>Aeolis,</HI> were only accounted <HI>Greeks:</HI>
the other Nations of <HI>Asia</HI> were called <HI>Barbarians.</HI> (5) <HI>Lydia</HI> was the fifth named in our Division;
and in her are many Cities, which we have mentioned in Scripture, and are common among other

Writers. Of these the chief are <HI>Laodicea, Thyatira, Philadelphia, Sardis,</HI> where <HI>Croesus</HI> kept his Court,
and <HI>Pergamus</HI> the Seat of <HI>Attalus,</HI> that made the <HI>Romans</HI> his Heir, and where <HI>Galen</HI> the great Physici|an
was born, and lived 140 years. (6) The first was <HI>phrygia minor;</HI> it is called <HI>Troas</HI> by the Inha|bitants,
and those are now <HI>Greeks, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Arabians;</HI> heretofore they were the antient <HI>Trojans,</HI> that

(7) The last was <HI>Phrygia major;</HI> and on this was <HI>Gordion,</HI> the very Town where <HI>Gordius</HI> hampered
his Plow-tacklings in such a knot that none might unty, but he that should possess the Monarchy of the
World; and indeed it proved true enough in <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. Another was <HI>Midaium,</HI> where

to whom Saint <HI>Paul</HI> directs an Epistle. And all these were contained within the compass of that one
part which bears the name of <HI>Asia propria.</HI></P>
<P>(10) The other Provinces of <HI>Asia minor</HI> have their Stories worth the Memory. (1) The first was
<HI>Cilicia</HI> now called <HI>Garamania;</HI> whose People in times past were noted for grand Pirats, till overcome

continual hostility with <HI>Rome,</HI> and excellent Archery: for the Inhabitants used their Bow with as much
dexterity in their retreat as in the Battle; and by that means oftentimes won advantage upon the ene|my

<HI>China,</HI> by <HI>Ptolomy, Sinarum Regio:</HI> it hath in it 240 Cities of note. In this Region is <HI>Quinsay,</HI> the greatest
City in the world. It hath on the North a wall of 100 miles in length. (14) The last is <HI>India,</HI> and
the largest portion of earth that passeth under one name. <HI>Strabo</HI> writes that there were 50000 Towns

a shorter Surve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. We will rank them into the same order with the Continent.</P>
<P>(14) The first are of <HI>Asia</HI> the less, and lie more West-ward toward <HI>Europe.</HI> They only worth
note are two, <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and <HI>Cyprus.</HI> (1) First <HI>Rhodes</HI> is in the Sea over against <HI>Caria</HI> In the chief
City of this Isle stood the <HI>Colossus</HI> in the form of a man, erected in a kind of Religion to the Sun, that
once a day at least breaks out upon the Isle, howsoever cloudy it be in other places. <HI>Graeians</HI> heretofore
possest it; and when the Christians had lost the Holy Land, the <HI>Emperour</HI> of <HI>Constantinople</HI> gave this
Isle to the Knights of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> in the year 1308. But now the Inhabitants are most
<HI>Turks,</HI> and some <HI>Iews</HI> sent thither out of <HI>Spain.</HI> As for Christians, they may not stay in the City in the
night time. (2) The second is <HI>Cyprus,</HI> a place heretofore consecrated to <HI>Venus,</HI> to whom both men
and women peformed their sacrifice naked, till by the prayer of <HI>Barnabas</HI> the Apostle the Temple
was ruined. <HI>Trogus</HI> reports, that the fathers of this Isle were wont to prostitute their Daughters to Ma|riners
for money, whereby to raise them a portion against they could get them husbands: but Christi|anity
corrected those barbarous Customs. In time it was made a <HI>Roman</HI> Province, and in the division
of the Empire was assigned to the Emperor of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> So it continued till <HI>Richard</HI> the first of
<HI>England,</HI> in his voyage put into this place for fresh water: but being incensed by the discourteous usage
of the <HI>Cyprians,</HI> turned his intent into an invasion, took the King prisoner, and bound him in silver
fetters. Afterwards he sold it to the Templers for a time, but recovered it again, and exchanged it for
the title of <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>(15) Lastly, the Islands of <HI>Asia</HI> the great lie most in the <HI>Indian</HI> or Eastern Ocean, and indeed are
innumerable, but the chief of account are these; <HI>Ormus, Zeilan, Summatra, Avirae Insulae, Bocuro,
Iava, Major</HI> and <HI>Minor, Iapan,</HI> and <HI>Moluccoes,</HI> and the <HI>Philippian</HI> Isles.</P>
<P>The first is <HI>Ormus,</HI> exceeding barren, and yet of it self a kingdom, and full of Trade. (2) <HI>Zeilan</HI>
so happy in pleasant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ruits, that some have thought it was the place of Paradise. (3) <HI>Summatra</HI> lying di|rectly

with all sorts of Spices. In these is said to be the Bird of Paradise that flieth continually, having no
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eet to rest upon: The Hen layeth her eggs (if you will believe it) in a hole of the Cocks back. (10)
Last'y, the <HI>Phillippian</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sles that lie North of the <HI>Molucc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI> are 1100. as <HI>Maginus</HI> numbers them. They

abound with Spices, and part of the Inhabitants have entertained Christianity.</P>
<P>(16) And thus I have made a brief dispatch both of the Continent and Islands of either <HI>Asia,</HI> and
have given my Reader a hint (at least) of their stories, which he may find at large in their several
Authors.</P>

<P><HI>AFrica,</HI> as it lay nearest the seat of the first people, so questionless it was next inhabi|ted:
and therefore requires the second place in our Division. It is generally agreed
upon, that the North parts were possest by the sons of <HI>Cham</HI> not long after the confu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i|on.
And so indeed that Kingly Prophet in the 78 <HI>Psalm,</HI> useth the tents of <HI>Cham</HI> for
the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which is that part of <HI>Africa</HI> which joyns upon the South west of
<HI>Asia,</HI> and is divided from the Holy Land but by a small <HI>Isthmus.</HI> Give the people
their own asking, and they will have the glory of the first Inhabitants of the world: and prove it too
both from the temperature of their air, and fertility of their soil, which breeds and nourisheth not only
Plants and fruits, but sends forth, of its own vertue, living creatures in such sort, as amazeth the be|holder.
We have a report (if you will belive it) that in a ground neer the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> there have
been found <HI>Mice</HI> half made up, and Nature taken in the very nick, when she had already wrought life in
the fore-parts, head and breast, the hinder joynts yet remaining in the form of earth. Thus I suppose they
would have man at first grown out of their soil, without the immediate hand of God in his Creation.
And it hath been the opinion of some vain Philosophers, that for this cause have made the <HI>Eihiopians</HI>
to be the first people: for that there the Sun by his propinquity, wrought soonest upon the moisture of
the ground, and made it fit for mortality to sprout in.</P>
<P>(2) But to leave these, without doubt <HI>Africa</HI> is of great antiquity, and so is allowed by all Historians
of credit: In the year 1566 the people were increased to an exceeding multitude; and therefore were
enforced to enlarge their bounds, upon their neighbouring Countries. For as it was of a most rare
fertility; so it lay not any long way, and had free access to it by land from the garden of our first Pa|rents.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="207">(3) In the time of <HI>Abraham</HI> we have better assurance from the Word of God, that it was then
a place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, and the Inhabitants of some growth, for they were able to supply the wants of the
Countries adjoyning by their store: and thither went <HI>Abraham</HI> out of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> to avoid
the great famine, <HI>Gen.</HI> 12. She had then her Princes, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his mighty men, that feared not
to resist God, and were afterward made the instruments of his punishments upon the children of <HI>Israel:</HI>
for they kept them in bondage four hundred years, as was foretold to <HI>Abraham</HI> in the 15 of
<HI>Genesis.</HI></P>
<P>(4) But this proof of Ancientry concerns not the whole Country: only those Regions which
lie under the temperate <HI>Zone.</HI> The rest for a long time after were unknown to our Geographers, held
not habitable, indeed, beyond mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> by reason of the extream heat. The reports which pass of
it before <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s time were but at random, and by guess of such as had never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed it round, or
scarce come within sight of it, but at a great distance, and by this means, either out of their own er|rour,
or else a desire of glory more than they had deserved: or perhaps a Travellers trick, to cheat
the ignorant world that could not confute their reports, they spread many idle fables of monstro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
people without heads, with their eyes and mouths in their breasts, maintained to this day by some Au|thors
of good esteem. But for my part I hold it most reasonable to credit Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> who was
born and died in <HI>Africa.</HI> That he in his eighth Book <HI>De Civitate Dei,</HI> acknowledgeth no such crea|tures;
or if they be, they be not men, or if men, not born of <HI>Adam.</HI> And our later Discoveries
joyn in with him, that report not (upon their own&punc; experience) of any other people than such as our
selves are: and yet I suppose they have seen more of the Country than ever any heretofore did. For
they pass not now to sail it round once a year, by the <HI>Cape of good hope</HI> to the East-side of the very
<HI>Ist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">inus</HI> toward the Red-Sea.</P>
<P>(5) This course by the South was discovered by one <HI>Vasco de Gama,</HI> in the year 1497. and a way
<PB N="26" REF="208">
found to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> by which the Princes of <HI>Portugal</HI> receive an infinite gain, both in Spices and
other Merchandise. The hope of which first set them upon the Adventure. And in this one thing we
owe much to our own Countrey, otherwise a detestable plague, that the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">atiate desire of wanton
commodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ies hath opened to us a large part of the world befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> not known, and which we hope may
hereafter increase the light of the Gospel, and the number of the Elect.</P>
<P>(6) If we compare her to the two other portions of the same Hemisphere, she is situated
wholly South, and in part West-ward. It is divided on the North from <HI>Europe</HI> by the <HI>Mediterran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">um</HI>
Sea: On the South, where it runs into a kind of point at the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pe of good Hope,</HI> it is bound with the
vast Ocean, which in that part hath the name of the <HI>Athiopick</HI> Sea: on the East with the Red Sea,
and on the West with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, called there in our common Maps, <HI>Mare del North.</HI> So
that in breif we reckon both her Longitude and Latitude in the largest parts to be near upon 4200.
English miles.</P>
<P>(7) Not withstanding this vast extent of ground, yet we of <HI>Europe</HI> still keep our own, and by au|thority
of the most and best Geographers, exceed as much for number, as either this or <HI>Asia</HI> do for
room. Cause enough there is why <HI>Africa</HI> indeed should come short of bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h: for in most parts she hath
scarce plenty sufficient to maintain Inhabitants, and where there is, we shall meet with multitudes of
ravening Beasts, or other horrible Monsters, enough to devour both it and us. In a word, there is no
Region of the world so great an enemy to mans commerce: there is such scarcity of water, that no
creature almost could live, had not nature provided thereafter; that the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er part of them endures
not drink in the very midst of Summer. So <HI>Pliny</HI> reports. And if, as sometimes they be inforced by such
as take them, they suddenly perish. Thus we see how God gives a property to each place, that may
make up her defects, lest it should be left as well by beasts as men. Their Land is full of sandy deserts
w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ich <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e open to the winds and storms, and ofttimes are thrown up into Billows like waves of the

Sea, and indeed are no less dangerous. <HI>Straho</HI> writes that <HI>Cambyses</HI> his Army was thus hazarded in <HI>Ae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hi|opia.</HI>
And <HI>Herodotus,</HI> that the <HI>Psilli,</HI> an ancient but foolish Nation (it seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">) in <HI>Africa,</HI> as they marched
toward the South, to revenge themselves upon the winds for drying up their Rivers, were over-whelmed
with sand, and so died in their graves. Besides these annoyances, it is so full of a venomous kind of
Serpent, that in some places they dare not dress their Land, unless they first sence their legs with Boots
against the sting. Other wild creatures there are which range about, and possess to themselves a great
portion of this Country, and make a Wilderness of <HI>Lions, Leopards, Elephants,</HI> and in some places
<HI>Crocodiles, Hyenaes, Basilisks,</HI> and indeed Monsters without either number or name. <HI>Afr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ca</HI> now every

<P>(8) But among all these inconveniences, commodities are found of good worth; and the very evils
yield at last their benefit, both to their own Country and other Parts of the world. The <HI>Elephant,</HI> a doci|ble

As if here they strove to reach eternity, as they did before in the plain of <HI>Shinar</HI> to top
Heaven.</P>
<P>(2) Sure I am, what ever part of the world was first famous, <HI>Europe</HI> soon got the start, and took
the Scepter of the earth into her hand, she had the name with <HI>Pliny</HI> of <HI>Orbis domitorum genitrix:</HI> and
well she might, if we but read her story, since first she came in view: In the <HI>Greek</HI> Monarchy <HI>Alexander</HI>
was her Champion. In the Latine Empire the <HI>Romans</HI> bare the sway, and scarce left a corner of the
earth then known unconquered. And to this day the Princes of <HI>Eur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pe</HI> enlarge their D ominions up|on
the Regions of the other three. A small portion as we are of this little Isle, in respect of their vast
<PB N="36" REF="213">
Continent, yet have we a part too in <HI>America</HI> for our peculiar, and hope still to bring more into our
prossessions that we may bring them unto Christ.</P>
<P>(3) In respect of the two other quarters in the Eastern Hemisphere, <HI>Europe</HI> is partly West, and
partly North, for she is situated North-ward, betwixt the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> and the Polar Artick:
and Westward hath no Continent betwixt her and <HI>America,</HI> but is bounded with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean.
On the East toward <HI>Asia,</HI> she hath the <HI>Mare Aegeum,</HI> which the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Archipelagus,</HI> and the <HI>Pontus
Euxinus,</HI> or <HI>Mare Magor.</HI> And the <HI>Palus Meoris</HI> and the River <HI>Tanais.</HI> South-ward it hath
the <HI>Mediterraneum</HI> and <HI>Fretum Herculeum;</HI> So that it is almost encompast with the Seas, and hath
the form of a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> whose <HI>Isthmus</HI> that joyns it ot the rest of the Continent is to be reckoned that
part, which lyeth betwixt the branches of the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> and the <HI>Mare Glaciale:</HI> These are her out
bounds</P>
<P>(4) If we view her within we shall find that Nature has not spent her store, nor was she close han|ded
when she allotted her portion. And though <HI>Europe</HI> indeed be the least, yet is she furnished in all
points with the like variety: her Rivers as commodious as those of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and her Moun|tains
no less famous than <HI>Taurus</HI> or <HI>Atlas.</HI> Her measure indeed is not comparable to any of the other
three: She bears in Longitude but 3800. miles from S. <HI>Vincent</HI> in <HI>Portugal</HI> to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> And in
Latitude at most 1200. and that too from the <HI>Aegean</HI> to the frozen Sea, by some account not above
900.</P>
<P>(5) But by her extent (as it is) small; it adds to her glory, that <HI>in exiguo res numerosa jacet:</HI> that yet
sheexceeds those vaster Regions, and bears the name of the most happy Country in the world, both for
plenty of Corn, Plants, Fruits, for Rivers and Fountains of admirable vertues, for beauty as well of
Cities, Castles, and Horses, as men and women of excellent feature. For the study of Arts, for sin|cerity
in Religion, and what-ever else God hath pleased to bless his Church with from the beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="213">(6) She wants nothing but what she may well spare; wild beasts, which cause Deserts in the parts
where they breed: hot Spices, which fit not our temper: and rather corrupt our manners, than mend
our diet: precious Iewels, and the like, which have brought in a degree of vain and useless pride, not
known before by our Predecessors; yet too of gold, silver, and other commodious Metals she hath her por|tion.
And in brief is of a very prosperous temper, yet of so strange variety, that it is admirable to
think that there is no place in this quarter, but is fit for any man to live in. Insomuch as every corner
is inhabited, as is confirmed by our later Travellers: though heretofore it hath been questioned by reason
of the extream cold toward the Pole. This in general.</P>

of each, and direct him principally to their situation, that he may with ease find their propinqui|ty
and distance in respect of each other, which cannot be so aptly exprest in their several Maps; nor so
easily scanned as in this, which presents to his eye all at one view.</P>

saith <HI>Appianus,</HI> and little less (as it seemeth) in length. The compass is reckoned by us to be 1890
<HI>English</HI> miles. It is begirt on every side with Seas, unless on the Eastern, and there it is joyned to <HI>France</HI>
by a kind of <HI>Isthmus,</HI> when the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains cross from one Sea to the other, and set the li|mits
to both Kingdoms. On the West it is bounded with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, on the North with

Till within this 800 years it continued mangled and broken by many turns of Fortune. Since it hath
felt variety enough, now it is wholly subject to one Monarch, though it yet carry the name of three
Kingdoms, <HI>Aragou, Castile,</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> The Land yields all sorts of Wines, Sugar, Fruits, Grain,
Oyls, Metals, especially Gold and Silver. It is fertile enough for the Inhabitants. For indeed they
are not many, nor have they so great Cities as there are in other Regions in <HI>Europe.</HI> Besides, the con|ditions
of those for the most part are base: The meanest proud, the best superstitious and hypocrites:
most of them lascivious. Give them their own, they are good Souldiers, not so much for their valour

compass of it is about a thousand miles. It is divided into 17 Provinces. And of these four are
Dukedoms, seven Earldoms, five Baronies, and one Marqueship. The Dukedoms are (1) <HI>Brabant,</HI>

<P><HI>AMERICA</HI> must yeild her self to the last place of my Division. She is stiled commonly
the New World in respect of what was known in <HI>Ptol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">my</HI>'s time. And this name im|ports
glory enough that she singly can equallize the title of <HI>World,</HI> and a larger
World than can be made up by the other three, if we reckon in the Territories
not yet fully discovered, and therefore indeed deserve not each to it self a several De|scription.</P>
<P>(2) And since the hath enough upon due right to prefer her worth, there will be no need of that
counterfeit gloze of ancientry, which many pretend in the search of her original. Some there are that
upon their own bare conjecture pronounce her as old as the story of our <HI>Antipodes:</HI> others as <HI>Solomons</HI>
Voyage for Gold into the Land of <HI>Ophir.</HI> In brief, my line will reach but 132 years backward, to the
time of <HI>Christopher Columbus a Genoay:</HI> before him I read of none that durst arrogate to himself any
certain knowledge of those parts, unless a br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gging <HI>Spaniard</HI> without a name or note of description. There
are a sort of ungreatful ones, that commonly debase them most that deserve of them best: and judge it
a thing worthy their hate, to be out gone in any fair action, though it redound to their own profit.
Pardon my zeal to truth; it warms my stile against those Robbers, in the behalf of so honourable
a man: They are no petty theeves that would steal from one his immortality; as what less could he deserve,
that gave us the knowledge of another world, and laid the way open for the entrance of the Gospel, to
the saving (as we hope) many millions of souls?</P>

<PB N="47" REF="218">
or cold, that could make it less habitable or fruitful, than those places of the old world, which lay
under the same Climates, and had the like respect to the Heavens. These indeed were good rational
perswasions, but the difficulty would have daunted a mean spirit, and dasht not the action only, but
the very thought. His resolution was confirmed, and his purpose well digested to himself in the year

Western Hemisphere, under the name of the <HI>New World</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> in the largest sense are four
<HI>(1) America propria, (2) The Islands. (3) Terra Septentrionalis incognita. (4) T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rra Australis incogni|ta</HI>
or <HI>Terra Magellanica.</HI></P>
<P>(6) <HI>America propria,</HI> with her Islands are the first, and were first discovered: She is divided from the
old world by the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean on her East, and on her West, with the pacifique Sea, or <HI>Mare
del Znr</HI> North; and South she hath the <HI>Terrae incognitae,</HI> and so possesseth to her self almost the whole
Hemisphere. What lyeth beyond her toward each Pole from the <HI>Aequator</HI> appears as yet but as wastle
groud in our Maps: for the experience of our Travellers have not reached so far, as to search fully in|to
the Commodities of the Countries; or nature of their Inhabitants, yet questionless there are many
and may hereafter yi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ld as much profit as any other.</P>
<P>(7) Of the quality of this Region in general we can speak but little. For by reason of her length
<PB N="48" REF="219">
and breadth, she lyeth at such several distance in respect of the Heavens, that she admits indeed all varie|ty
almost either of plenty or want, which we have hitherto found in <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> or <HI>Europe.</HI> Here
admirable for the fertility of soly; then again as barren: here temperate, their scorching hot, else|where
as extream cold. Some Regions watered with dainty Rivers, others again infested with per|petual
drouth. Some Plains, some Hills: some Woods, some Mines; and what not in some tract or
other within the compass of <HI>America?</HI> Yet nothing almost common to the whole but Barbarisme of
manners, Idolatry in Religion, and sottish ignorance, such as hardly distinguisheth them from brutes; else
they would not have taken reasonable men to be immortal Gods as at first they did: yet what either
God was, or immortality, they knew no more than instinct of nature gave them, only a confused
thought they had of some place or other (God knows where) behind some Hill, where the blessed
after their death. And from thence they supposed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came at their first arrival. But
it was not long before the Tyrants cudgelled their simplicity, and by their cruelty appeared to them
rather Devils from hell, than Saints from Heaven.</P>
<P>(8) Yet still the <HI>In lund</HI> Countries retain for the most part their in-bred blindness: and worship the
Sun, Moon, and Stars, and they have their other Spirits, which they call their <HI>Zemes,</HI> and adore them
in Images made of Cotton-wooll, which oft-times by the delusion of Satan seem to move, and utter an
hideous noise, that works in these poor Idolaters a great awe, lesst they should harm them.</P>
<P>(9) The rest of their Customes are answerable to their Religion, beastly. They go naked, and are
very lustful people without distinction of sex. In many places they are <HI>Anthropophagi,</HI> and prey upon each
other like Wolves. They labour not much to sustain themselves: but are rather content to take what
the earth can yield without Tillage. This in general.</P>
<P>(10) Time hath not given way to many divisions of this <HI>America.</HI> I find one only in the best

them are subdivided into their Provinces.</P>
<P>(11)<HI>Mexicana</HI> is the first, and her bounds on the East and West are the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and

South it hath the <HI>Peninsula Peruviana:</HI> and North-ward we are not sure whether Sea or Land. It

<HI>Forbishers</HI> Straights, from another of our worthy Country-men, that were interested before in the same
service. This Region is held to be the first discovered of the <HI>New world.</HI> The North of it is still un|known.
It yields plenty of gold, but is exteam cold. The people ingenious and good Artificers in most

skins, which they venture into the main Sea without danger.</P>
<P>(22) <HI>Peninsula Peruviana,</HI> is the South tract of <HI>America</HI> from the <HI>Isthmus</HI> to the <HI>Magellanick</HI>
Straights. The same Seas are the bounds upon the East and West, which were of the other <HI>Mexicana,</HI>
by which she is divided from <HI>Africa</HI> on the East, and on the West at a large distance from the most
Southren Islands of <HI>Asia.</HI> The compass of it is 17000 miles. From North to South, there runs a conti|nued
course of high Mountains, whose tops the very Fowls of the air cannot reach by flight. And from
thence descend many admirable Rivers, among which <HI>Maragno</HI> and <HI>Argenteus</HI> are most famous. The
one for his extent, and the other for his plenty of silver. The Country is exceeding rich, but the
people differ not much from the worst of Beasts. They devour mans flesh, filthy worms, and what
else comes in their way. The chief Provinces are numbred thus; <HI>(1) Castella Aurea. (2) Guiana.

Country-man <HI>Iohn Oxenham,</HI> who by the direction of <HI>Moors</HI> skilled in the Country, went to the Land
of Pearls, and took from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> an incredible weight of gold and Silver. <HI>(2) Nova Andalusia</HI>
South-ward from <HI>Castella del oro.</HI> The chief Towns are <HI>Tocoio</HI> and <HI>Sancta Espritia. (3) Nova Granata</HI>

<P>(24) <HI>Guiana</HI> is the second Province of the <HI>Peninsula Peru Maria,</HI> situated just under the <HI>Aequino|ctial.</HI>
On the North it hath the main River <HI>Oronoque</HI> or <HI>Raliana</HI> from Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> who went
further than any before him into the Country. This River is navigable by report above 1000 miles,
On the South it hath likewise another great River of the <HI>Peninsula</HI> called <HI>Maragnon,</HI> which exceeds
the former, and is navigable 600 miles in length. In this province stands the largest City of <HI>America</HI>
called <HI>el Dorodo,</HI> or the guilded City: For indeed there is plenty of gold. The length, as it is spoken
by some Travellers, will exceed belief. The second memorable Town is S. <HI>Thome:</HI> not so much for
her own worth, as the disastrous fortunes of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> who there first lost his eldest son, and
after returned home with that ill success, as it cost him his own life.</P>
<P>(25) <HI>Peru</HI> the third in rank, yet by name it seems to be the chiefest Province of this Southern
Tract. It is contained almost betwixt the <HI>Aequator</HI> and the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Capricorn.</HI> On the North it hath
<HI>Castella del oro.</HI> on the South <HI>Chila,</HI> on the West <HI>mare del Zur,</HI> and on the East the Mountains of <HI>Peru.</HI>
It is a very rich Country, aboundeth with gold and silver, little esteemed among the Inhabitants. For
by report the <HI>Spaniard</HI> ordinarily shooed their Horses with gold: Another great Commodity is To|bacco,
<PB N="54" REF="222">
a toy to play withall, but yields a great Revenue to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> In this Province stands
<HI>Lima</HI> the Arch-Bishops See, and place of residency for the <HI>Vicer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y Cusco,</HI> where the Native Kings of
<HI>Peru</HI> had wont to keep their Court. The Inhabitants are strange Idolaters, and worship a black Sheep,
Serpents, and other ugly creatures.</P>

the compass about 3000. The Inhabitants are rude, live for the most part in the Bodies of trees. They
swim excellently, and are able to keep under the water for a long space. Their chief Commodities are
Sugar and Brazile wood. The people are covered with natural hair, cruel, lascivious, false, and what
not? In this Region is an herb, called <HI>Viva,</HI> which if you touch, it will shut up, as a Dasie in the
night, and will not open till the party that injured it be out of sight. Here are few Towns of note,
St. <HI>Anna, Equitum, Ascensio, Pernanbuco.</HI></P>
<P>(27) <HI>Chile</HI> is the last of the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> and on the North hath <HI>Peru,</HI> on the West the <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI>
on the South the <HI>Magellanick</HI> Straits, on the East the <HI>Virginian Ocean,</HI> She hath her name from her ex|tream
cold temper, in so much that many are frozen to death, and hardned like marble. It is a rich
Country as well for Gold as other Commodities of worth. The Rivers are fed with Snow that falls
from the tops of high Mountains. The people are of large stature, and very valiant. The chief City is
St. <HI>Iames,</HI> where a Colony of <HI>Spaniards</HI> keep hold.</P>
<P>And thus we are travelled from the <HI>Basis</HI> to the very <HI>Pyris,</HI> at the South <HI>America.</HI> The utmost poynt

<P>(5) This Region was first called <HI>Helles,</HI> from <HI>Hello</HI> the son of <HI>Dencalion</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> and in after times
took the name of <HI>Graecia,</HI> from <HI>Graecus</HI> the son of <HI>Cecrops,</HI> and King then of that part only which was

<P>(6) The bounds of <HI>Greece</HI> have been severally set, as her government hath been either enlarged
by her own valour, or impaired by a foraign enemy. But as she is now taken by Geographers, her

<P>(8) And besides the base misusage of the mis-believing Turk, the very Natives themselves are fal|len
from the noble disposition of their Predecessors into an incredible sottishness: and those which
before reckoned the rest of the earth Barbarous in comparision to their polite Common-wealth, are now
themselves sunk below the envy of the meanest Nation, and become the most miserable object of pity
living upon the earth. Indeed they may hardly be said to live, for that they take no farther care than
barely to live. They are lazy beyond belief, and ignorant almost beyond recovery: for they have now
no means to bring their children either to learning or manners. Not an Academy in all <HI>Greece.</HI> Their
carriage generally uncivil: their feasts riotous, and their mirth debaucht. Their Wives are well-favoured,
and so indeed they must be; for they use them no longer as their Wives than they continue to their
liking: when they once fade they are put to the house drudgery. Their language is the same as heretofore
but rudely corrupted, though (as <HI>Maginus</HI> reports) it differs not so much as the <HI>Italian</HI> from the pure
<HI>Latine.</HI> They have no habit almost proper; but those which serve the <HI>Turk</HI> wear their fashion: the

to its own fruit, that it scarce ever ripens what it brings forth. The people are many, and those very

one died, in stead of mourning they set forth games and feasts to congratulate his freedom from the
troubles of this earthly condition: and the wife only, whom he loved best (for they had many) was
thought worthy to be killed by her best friends at her husbands grave, that she might bare him com|pany
in the other world: the rest bewailed their neglect, and the residue of their life was to them as a
disgrace. When a child was born, neighbours were called to bemoan his entrance into a multitude of

<P>(3) The plat-form was first cast in a figure of a quadrangle upon the <HI>mons Palatinus,</HI> for the other
six noted hills were not then taken in, but added in after ages, by their several Kings. It was began (it
seems) but sleight, and the walls raised not very high when <HI>Rhemus</HI> could skip them over, in contempt
of his brot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ers poor enterprise: but the mock cost him his life; he was slain by <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ulus:</HI> and he now left
the sole founder to give name to this new building.</P>
<P>(4) <HI>Romulus</HI> then is their first King, and takes upon him the government of such discontented
and mas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">erless young Shepherds, as he had raked together to people his Common-wealth; a crue

to continue their succession: And without doubt themselves had seen their last man born, had not
their own wit bestead them more, than the womens love. For when they saw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">heir worth was not suf|ficient
to woe fairly with effect, they proclaimed a day for solemn sports, which they presu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed (and

<P>(5) The City at this time was not above two miles in circuit; the Inhabitants not much above the

where the servant might secure himself from his Master, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urderer from his Magistrate, the debtor
from his arrest, and each fault from his punishment: and then he soon called in incredible swarms
(such as they were) of <HI>Latines, Tuscaines, Trojans, Arcadians,</HI> and made up a Miscellany of people, each
brought in the proper sins of his own Country, and have there left them as a testimony of their ance|st

<P>(6) This policy might seem good at first to make up his number; For who else (but such) would
leave a setled state (though mean) in a well ordered Kingdom, to apply himself to novel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es of so
uncertain event? But in a few years their King found that there was more need of a <HI>Pistrinum</HI> to
correct, than an <HI>Asylum</HI> to shelter his offenders, and therefore was fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ced to make setled Laws for

he should be thence forward honoured in <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> as her tutelare. In brief, the more likely sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ise of
his manner of death is, that in the storm he was cut in pieces by some of his Senators, who had either
suffered under his tyranny, or at least had hope to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aise themselves by his fall.</P>
<P>(8) Their second King was <HI>Numa Pompilius,</HI> religious in his kind beyond all others, and ordained

Champion left of her <HI>Horatii,</HI> against the three others, who were notwithstanding by a feigned flight
of their own adversary drawn severally out into single combate, and successively fell by the sword of the
<HI>Roman victor. Alba</HI> was now carried captive to <HI>Rome,</HI> and gave up her honours as a Trophy to this

<P>(12) <HI>Tarquinius Superbus</HI> was the seventh and last King, proud and cruel, yet that too, though it
cost him his Crown, enlarged the Kingdom to the Romans: for it prevailed upon many strong
Provinces of <HI>Italy,</HI> which they after enjoyed with better hearts, and ruled with more equity, than he
used in the unjust oppression of his neighbours. His name was grown odious when the lust of his Son
<HI>Tarquinius</HI> wronged the chaste <HI>Lucretia,</HI> both together stirred the people to dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">obe him of his Title,
and bethink themselves of some other form of government, which might sound more of the <HI>Roma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>

fortunes, it is esteemed but her child-hood, her infancy: while she had not yet spake, nor the world well
heard of her actions, farther than her own home, and her Countries near about. She began now to feel
her strength, and when she had first freed her self from the oppression of her home bred Tyrant; she
soon after spread her Arms over all <HI>Italy,</HI> and her fame through most parts of the world. Her power
was now no more at the disposing of one King, but designed over into the hands of two aged and
wise Citizens, of their own (though the best) rank: and this they were to use, rather as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">es in
<PB N="72" REF="231">
trust, than free possessors; wherefore the <HI>Romans</HI> baulkt their insolency, which their last King had
before practised, both in the name of their new Governours, for they were called only <HI>Consules &agrave;
Consulendo;</HI> and in their term of Government, for it became now annual, which was not before li|mited
unless by death: and lastly, by their ensigns of state, their twelve <HI>lictors</HI> and <HI>fasces,</HI> which were
not allowed to both, but to each in turns for their several month. And this went on without breach al|most
six years, till the <HI>Romans</HI> thought fit to correct their Laws by the <HI>Greek</HI> Copy; and therefore de|puted
three of their best esteemed subjects to see <HI>Athens,</HI> to peruse their orders and customs, of which
the world had then a great opinion: for it was indeed the mother of learning.</P>
<P>(14) They returned them written at first in ten tables made of brass; two more were soon after
added, and together were distinguished from their own municipal laws by the name of <HI>Leges 12. tabu|larum.</HI> The Consuls power was now taken off; and thus was their rule of justice put into the hands
of ten, whom they called <HI>Decemviri.</HI> Each ruled in his turn, and (for that course) had a power well|nigh
as large as their Kings or Consuls, else differed little at other times from a private <HI>Romane.</HI> This
began some 303 years after their first founder, and had continued but three, when <HI>Appius</HI> laid false
claim to <HI>Virginia</HI> for his bond-maid, that indeed he might dishonour her as his strumpet. By this means
he doubly provoked the Commons, both with her injuries, and her fathers sorrow, who was forced to
murder his own daughter, to quit her from the lust of the <HI>Decemviri:</HI> and therefore they took revenge,
not upon him only, but his office; abrogated the <HI>Decemviratus</HI> and returned the authority into the
hands of Consuls as before: yet so, as oft times by intercourse the <HI>Tribuni militum</HI> put in for a con|sulary
soveraignty, and was admitted to the same dignity, though not the name, which the <HI>Patricii</HI>
only referred to themselves as their royalty. It was first procured by the importunate motion of the
Commons, that they might be equally capable of the Consulship. To this, though the nobility would
not give their full assent in all circumstances, yet they were constrained for their own peace to yield

<HEAD>The Description of the Kingdome of BOHEMIA.</HEAD>
<P>IN our Description of <HI>Germany,</HI> we reckoned <HI>Bohemia,</HI> but as a Province among the rest: and
therefore she was mentioned there with no more solemnity, than the other parts were. We
purpose here to declare it an intire Kingdom of it self: which besides her own compass (as
she is most commonly limited by Geographers) hath under-subjects, Dukedoms, and Mar|quisates,
such as do her homage, and make her well worthy of a more particular History, than we
had before room for.</P>
<P>(2) The ancient Inhabitant of these parts was the <HI>Bemorum magna gens,</HI> as <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls it: and
placeth it somewhat South, toward <HI>Danubius</HI> under <HI>Suna sylva:</HI> After them, the <HI>Boii,</HI> a people of
<HI>Gallia Lugdunensis,</HI> which had been before conquered by <HI>Caesar</HI> (saith <HI>Quadus</HI>) and packt over the
<HI>Alpes</HI> to seek them a new seat in <HI>Italy.</HI> But, when they found the <HI>Romans</HI> too hot for their abode there,
they were forced to trudge farther, and to pass the River. <HI>Rhene</HI> into <HI>Germany,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> witnesseth,
where they found them a fit place to lurk in, compassed with a large Wood called the <HI>Sylva Hircinia:</HI>
and like enough they joyned in with the <HI>Bemi,</HI> to make up the name of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> But neither here
did they enjoy their peace long, for they were in time nestled out by a potent people of <HI>Swevia,</HI> called
<HI>Marcomanni:</HI> and they again had the like measure from the <HI>Sclavonians,</HI> a barbarous crue, which
came in upon them, under the conduct of an exiled murderer of <HI>Croatia,</HI> one <HI>Zechius,</HI> about the
year five hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>(3) From that time there hath been no general expulsion: but the present <HI>Bohemians</HI> are the pro|geny
of those <HI>Sclavonians,</HI> whose very language and customs are in use among them at this day.
Doubtless it was at first a rude Common-wealth, that had no other Governours, but so ungoverned
a multitude: for so they continued above an hundred years after <HI>Zechius.</HI> But when they had for a time
<PB N="89" REF="240">
endured the misery of such a confusion, they were content to agree upon some one for their Prince,
that might rule them: and the first which they elected was <HI>Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI> a man of gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">at esteem among
them for his wisdom and goodness.</P>
<P>(4) Till the time of <HI>Vratislaus</HI> it had the title of a Dukedome only. He was the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st King, and
was created by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth of <HI>Germany, Anno</HI> one thousand eighty six. Yet after that again, for
the succession of six Princes, it was governed by Dukes. For the second King was <HI>Vladislaus,</HI> the

other Dukes from his Predecessor <HI>Vla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">islaus</HI> the third. It hath been now long since fully setled into a

Her chief Rivers reckoned by <HI>Maginus</HI> are (1) <HI>Garnana Garone</HI> the greatest. (2) <HI>Ligeris Loyre</HI>
the sweetest. (3) <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">quana</HI> or <HI>Seyne</HI> the richest. (4) <HI>Rhodanus Rosne</HI> the swiftest: to these we may add,
(5) <HI>Some,</HI> upon which standeth <HI>Amicus.</HI></P>
<P>(7) Her air is healthful, and her grounds fertile; abounds almost with all commodities that may
make her one of the happiest Regions in Christendome, yet her greatest plenty is of Corn, Wine, and
Salt; which she distributes among her neighbouring Nations: and enricheth her self with such com|modities
from them as are not so fully afforded within her own limits. The women do partake of
their Countries fruitfulness: Insomuch that as the earth is scarce able to bear her plenty, so her plenty
could hardly sustain her people, had she not a vent for them into <HI>Spain, Italy, Germany, England,</HI> and
other Countries: And yet were there long since reckoned <HI>Habitatores <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">upra quindecin milliones, in|ter
quos octodecim millia nobillium,</HI> by <HI>Maginus.</HI></P>
<P>(8) In so great a multitude we must look to find as much variety of customes and dispositions. It
was the report of <HI>Caesar</HI> long since&punc; and seconded by a late authentick Author, <HI>Gallicas gentes lingua,
legibus &amp; institutis inter se differre: multa tamen multis esse communia.</HI> For the most part they are of a
fiery spirit for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he first onset in any action, but will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oon flagg. They desire change of Fortunes:
and pass not greatly whether to better or worse. Their women very jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">und, of a voluble tougue, and
as free of their speech, complemental to strangers, and win more by their wit than their beauty: one
and t'other are great enticers of mens affections; and they enjoy them as freely and securely, without
either check of conscience, or care of report. It is esteemed <HI>Vitium gentile,</HI> and indeed they can hard|ly
hear ill for it from any there, which is not equally guilty. Very factious, not only in carriage or
publick affairs, but in their private families, which proceeds for the most part from a self<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">conceit of
their own wit and wealth: and those will hardly admit a superior. Their Nobility have been reported to
<PB N="101" REF="246">
be liberal; but I suppose that fashion is now worn out: My self have specially noted the contrary in
divers&punc; which respect their purse more than their honour, and let pass the service and deserts of worthy
persons unrewarded, as if their gracious acceptance were a sufficient return of thanks for any office a
man can do them. They are practised to this garb by their pesantry, whom they reckon but as slaves,
and command as their proper servants, which the poor sneaks take as a favour, and are glad to be em|ployed
by their betters, that by their protection they may stand more free from the injury of their
equals. For the meanest of them are cruel, and affect to oppress their adversary, either by open vio|lence
or suit in Law, though to their own ruin. They are very ready to take Arms, and serve in the de|fence
of King and Country: need no more press than the stroke of a Drum; but are as rash in their
atchievements. They will not wait upon Counsel, but run as far on, as upon their strength they may,
and when they find that fails, they will as soon give ground.</P>
<P>(9) It hath had heretofore (and yet breeds) men of great esteem for Learning and Religion. St.
<HI>Bernard, Calvin, Beza,</HI> and <HI>Ramus</HI> were <HI>French,</HI> and many others, both of the <HI>Romish</HI> and Reformed
Churches. For as yet the people stand divided betwixt both, but not equally. The Papists are like to
continue the stronger hand, as long as their holy Father shall make murther a meritorious act: For by
their several Massacres they have destroyed many assemblies of the <HI>Hugonotes,</HI> as they call them. The
greatest I think that ever was practised by such as had entertained the name of Christians, was at <HI>Pa|ris</HI>
in the year 1572. when above thirty thousand souls suffered Martyrdom, and among the rest, some
Personages of great worth and note.</P>
<P>(10) It is subject to a Monarchical government, weilded by one sole and absolute King, which
bears the Title of the Christian King of <HI>France:</HI> his eldest son the <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> By their Salique
Law, no woman or her heirs may inherit: how justly, I may not determine But yet the <HI>English</HI> have
good reason to examine the Equity: For it cost our <HI>Edward</HI> the Third his Crown of <HI>France,</HI> to which
<PB N="102" REF="247">
he was heir in general by marriage of a daughter. But the truth is, we have been ever easie to part
with our hold there, or at least forced to forgo it by our civil dissentions at home, else, after all those
glorious Victories of our Predecessors, we might have had some Power more to shew there as well as
Title.</P>
<P>(11) There are very many Provinces belonging to this Kingdom, more than will find room here

<P>IN this we continue still the Description of <HI>Belgia,</HI> begun in the Map of <HI>France.</HI> For the title is
common as well to those Territories, as indeed to all the North-East Tracts of the old <HI>Gallia.</HI>
The portion hereditary to the <HI>French</HI> King, was marked out among the rest of his Dominions.
The residue (since it hath been by length of time, chance of war, or at least chance of Fortune,
dispersed into the power of several Princes) is better known to us by the familiar names of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI>
than <HI>Netherlands, Flandars, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>(2) In the search of her Original, we may have reference to our precedent Discourse. For questi|onless
it was possest by the <HI>Gauls,</HI> as the other parts were: aud (if trust may be given to those An|tique
Stories, whose truth is almost worn out with age) she reacheth her pedegree as high as any

under the conduct of our two <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nglish</HI> Brothers. For her chief Captain <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">elgius,</HI> whose memory she
preserves to this day in her name, is mentioned by <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">adus</HI> andother as companion to <HI>Brennius</HI>
in his expedition toward <HI>Macedonia,</HI> after they were intreated from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>(3) In the first times they were a stout people, and practised to continual wars by the bordering
<HI>Germans,</HI> which made them as well expert as hardy. It seems <HI>Caesar</HI> found them so in his tryal: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or
he gives them (in his Commentaries) the honour of a val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ant Nation above any other part of <HI>Gallia.</HI>

their tops above water at a dead low ebb. Lastly, <HI>Flanders,</HI> though but a single Province in this <HI>Bel|gia,</HI>
yet of that esteem, as the whole Countrey bears her name, and may indeed well enough upon
the same reason as she took it up. For (as the most will) it had its its <HI>Etymon &agrave; flatibus fluctibusque qui|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">

<P>(5) For on the North it is bounded with a part of the great Sea, and on the West with the main
Ocean: On the East with the Rivers <HI>Rhene</HI> and <HI>Mosa</HI> and on the South with <HI>Loraign, Campaigne</HI> and
<HI>Picardy,</HI> parts of the Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI> It is accounted to be in circuit 1000 <HI>Italian</HI> miles; no
Country abounds more with Lakes, Pools, and Rivers of great note. The principal are <HI>Rhene, Mosa,</HI> and
<HI>Scaldis,</HI> 16 others are specially named by <HI>Maginus,</HI> and more intimated, which afford them great
store of Fish, as well for their own use, as supply for traffique to other Nations.</P>
<P>(6) Yet by reason of her watry situation, it must needs be that the air is exceeding moist, and
therefore unwholsome: but not so as heretofore. For the multitude of Inhabitants, and those won|derful
industrious, have laboured out of many of her marshes, and drawn their Pools into running
channels; and by this means fewer vapours arise, insomuch that now the Natives at last may very well
agree with the temper, which (as <HI>Maginus</HI> gives it) <HI>incolarum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">anitati necnon digestioni conducit.</HI>
Their Summer is pleasant, not extream hot, nor abounds it with such troublesome flies and gnats as
ours doth. There is seldome any thunder heard, or lightning seen, or Earthquake felt. The reason is
the same for all. The Winter is not altogether so tolerable; but brings with it bleak winds and much
rain. Yet betwixt both, the Country is moderately fertile, yields corn and fruit, in some places more,
and in some le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s: very few Grapes, and those make but a hard Wine: no store of Mines; and yet
they are as rich as those which have.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="251">(7) For the people are very thrifty, painful, and ingenious in the invention of many pretty things,
which draw many other Nations to them for Traffique: and they lie as fit for it, having free access by
Sea to and from all the chief parts, as of <HI>Europe,</HI> so also <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> and are as skilful to
trace the Seas at pleasure. They have the name for the first Authors of the Compass, Clock, and
Printing. They are excellent Artificers, for working of Pictures in glass, for laying Colours in Oyl, for
Tapestry and other Hangings: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in brief, for any Oeconomical commodity, either for use or orna|ment:
and in their own private Families excell any other people. The men are of a goodly presence;
of a cold, or at least no cholerick temper. They neither love nor hate any extreamly; but will soon
forget both a good turn, and (they say) an injury. They are not very open, or easie of belief, nor apt to
be deceived. Not very proud, nor exceeding base. Not much given to <HI>Venus,</HI> but more to <HI>Bacchus,</HI>
especially when he presents himself upon an <HI>English</HI> Beer-barrel. For they will hardly make a bar|gain
before they be well whetted. This is their common character; but for the best part of it we
have found it far other, as in their commerce with us in the East <HI>Indies</HI> we have found, where by their
extream dealings with our Nation, they have made known their unthankfulness for the many benefits
our <HI>English</HI> have shewed them. But I return to their better qualities. Their women are fair, some|what
bold and free in their carriage, but yet sober and honest: excellent housewives, and in some
places traffique abroad, while their men play the cot-qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ans at home.</P>
<P>(8) As in their other businesses, so in their studies they are very laborious, and indeed trouble the
world with writing more than they have thanks for: as if they had a right (since they were the in|venters
of the Press) to use it at pleasure; so they do; and send forth every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>(9) The last quality required in a Nation of esteem (as they are) is valour. And indeed I may well
place it last. For so it grew upon them since the long war which they have had with the <HI>Arch-Duke.</HI>
Before they lived for the most part in peace; and as they had but little use of Chivalry, so they had as
little heart to it: but were counted a heavy dull people. To say truth, they have hardly yet recovered
that censure: for in the managing of their Land-fights especially, they are content enough to give way
to other Nations, and will hardly second them in any dangerous attempt. The <HI>English</HI> have both act|ed
and suffered their parts in the behalf of the <HI>Low Countries:</HI> and that (me-thinks) might have been
remembred in the midst of their tyrannical usage of our Merchants.</P>
<P>(10) These <HI>Netherlands</HI> towards our latter times were divided into 17 Provinces, whereof the most
part had several Rites and Governours, four Dukedomes, seven Earldomes, five Baronies, and one
Marqueship. But by the next marriages of the heirs to the sundry Titles, the whole at last fell upon
one, and was made an entire Government, and known by the name of the Dukedom of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> Yet
still doth each Province retain her proper Laws, liberty of Religion, and other Customes, which their
Rulers in succession were sworn to maintain for their parts: and the people again for their security,
had this main prerogative left them from the beginning; that if their Prince should at any time attempt
the contrary, they might, after Declaration, proceed to the choice of a new Governour. These Condi|tions
confirmed, it continued for a while peacefully, and by marriage with <HI>Mary,</HI> heir and last of the
house of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> it fell to <HI>Maximilian</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> Emperour of the <HI>Germans.</HI> And his Successour
<HI>Philip</HI> matching in the like sort with <HI>Ioan,</HI> heir to the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> joyned both together in his
eldest son <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, who by the Mother was entituled to <HI>Spain,</HI> and by his Father to <HI>Bar|gundy</HI>

or <HI>Netherlands,</HI> as for <HI>Austria</HI> it passed to another brother. Thus came it subject to the King of
<HI>Spain.</HI> And while yet the Emperour enjoyed it, they felt no misery of civil wars among themselves.
When he left it, he commanded this charge withall to his son <HI>Philip</HI> the second, that he should intreat
the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> well. But this he either forgot or neglected: and taking it in foul scorn to be so
curbed by the conditions of his Predecessors, began first with a pretence to Religion, and at last em|broiled
them in a bloudy war, which hath found no end to this hour; and caused them to cast off the
<HI>Spanish</HI> clog, which they did in the year 1581. and declared by their Writings, that <HI>Philip</HI> the second,
King of <HI>Spain,</HI> had forfeited his Government of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> by breach of his faith. And
withall they bound their people by a new oath, never to return to their obedience: which they yet make
good against the <HI>Arch-Dutchess,</HI> who by kindred to the <HI>Spanish</HI> King, and marriage to the <HI>Arch-Duke,</HI>
is at this time interested in the Government, and therefore in the quarrel.</P>

It is called the <HI>Paris</HI> of <HI>Ardenna,</HI> for by some that Forrest is reckoned into this Dukedom. It
stands on the East-side, was in <HI>Caesars</HI> time 500 miles in compass, now about 90. Near to <HI>Ardenna</HI> is
the <HI>Spaw Baths,</HI> of great fame for the cure of sundry diseases: And hath oftentimes given our false
<HI>English</HI> a pretence to leave their Countrey forsooth for Physick: when they have no other excuse

Villages, besides Castles, with several Earldoms, many other petty Governments. In the South is the

Tract, as much as contains 24 walled Towns, and 1800 Villages, and hath under him 52 Baronies.
<HI>Luick</HI> the chief City of the Bishoprick is an University, memorable for this one story, above any other
in Christendom: That at one time there studied 9 Kings sons, 24 Dukes sons, 29 Earls sons, &amp;c. The
Dukes part in the East is not of that fame, either for multitude of Towns and Villages, or command
of under territories. In the year 1293, the heirs male were extinct, and by that means it fell to the
Duke of <HI>Brabant.</HI> The whole Region is exceeding fertile, and affords almost all necessaries except
Wine: Among other commodities, it abounds with a kind of stone, of excellent use in Physick, called

as well for their lives as the Victory; and were blest with a success beyond hope: They mastered the
Castle, and the rest soon followed. It was of late recovered by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> after a long siege, where

of his infinite charge to maintain war, and the ticklish terms he stands upon for fear of displeasing

pastures are excellent, insomuch that they feed up their Cattel to an incredible bigness and weight. A

<HEAD>The Description of SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>IN our Division of <HI>Europe,</HI> we placed her Regions as they lay from the first <HI>Meridian</HI> of Longitude
in the <HI>Azores,</HI> and so on towards <HI>Asia</HI> Eastward. We will not here vary the course which was
there proposed, and that gave <HI>Spain</HI> the precedency, as lying most Westward into the <HI>Atlantick</HI>
Ocean. And indeed she puts forward as well upon her terms of Antiquity, as order of place. For
if her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> may be heard, she derives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">er Being from <HI>Tubal,</HI> the grand-child of <HI>Noah,</HI> and would
be one of the first Nations of the second world. Likely enough those parts might be inhabited by
his Progeny; but I doubt whether so soon after the floud, as himself lived, and as some would have
it, who suppose that he then kept Cattel, and named the Province <HI>Taraconensis,</HI> from the Hebrew
<HI>Taraco&punc;</HI> a possession of Herds. This and other the like improbable Relations pass over her original.
Which as we may not accept for truths, so we have no room here to confute them for lies. We must
be content rather to omit those former ages, which give us no light but by Fables; and begin with the
affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> which come within the compass of our known and approved Stories. As for the exploits
of <HI>Hercules,</HI> of <HI>Gerion,</HI> and <HI>Cacus,</HI> and the rest; questionless, they had some ground from truth it self,
if we knew how to search it forth: and here was their residence, men twelve hundred years by compute
before the <HI>Romans</HI> or <HI>Carthaginians</HI> enjoyed it. But by reason that the passage of those times, was de|livered
only in vain fictions, we can warrant nothing for certain till the <HI>Syrians</HI> there planted them|selves
in the Isle of <HI>Gades:</HI> and of them little, till the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were called in to aid them against
the disturbance of ill neighbours; when once they were mingled with so flourishing a Nation, they
wanted not Writers to record their actions, and sundry turns of Fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="256">(2) The next Inhabitants there of <HI>Spain,</HI> after the <HI>Syrians,</HI> and indeed the first which affords us any
Story worth observing, were the <HI>Carthaginians:</HI> and the first cause of their entrance was to defend the
Islanders of <HI>Cales:</HI> but when they had once got firm footing, and sucked the sweetness, they were not
to be removed by the easie term of friendship: but there kept hold, till a people stronger than them|selves
dispossessed them. The attempt was made by <HI>Scipio</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> forces; but they withstood
their assault with so resolved a courage, and so strong a hand, that it might oft times be questioned
<HI>Vter populus alteri esset pariturus?</HI> and so held play almost 200 years, and could not be fully subdued
into the form of a Province, till the Reign of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> yet after, they were held to it till <HI>Hono|rius.</HI></P>
<P>(3) About his sixth year was there a second Invasion made by the <HI>Vandales,</HI> and soon after by the
<HI>Gothes,</HI> which bare sway for above 300 years. The last King was <HI>Rodericus,</HI> who lost both himself and
Kingdom for a rape committed upon the Daughter of <HI>Iulian,</HI> a Noble Gentlemen, and at that time Em|bassadour
with the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Africa.</HI> When the Father had understood of his Daughters unworthy
injury, he brought back his revenge with him, 30000 Horse, any 180000 Foot, of <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Sarazens;</HI>
which discomfited the King, overthrew all the ressistance which he could make, and bespread
the Countrey with their Forces, where they and their posterity stood firm, till within the memory of
some which yet live.</P>
<P>(4) This change of State was before prophesied, and concealed in a large Chest within a part of
the Palace, which both the last King and his Predecessors were forewarned not to discover. But the
hope of an inestimable treasure made him transgress: and when he had entred, there appeared nothing
but the Portraictures of armed <HI>Moors,</HI> with a presage annexed, that when the part of the Palace should
be forced open, such enemies should ruine <HI>Spain.</HI> It is now at last but one people, but yet retains
the mixtures of those many Nations which have heretofore possest it, <HI>Goths, Sarazens,</HI> and <HI>Iews,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="257">
who were partly banisht hither by <HI>Hadrian</HI> the Emperour, and partly sent hither by <HI>Vlider Vbit</HI> the
<HI>Caliph</HI> after the <HI>Moors</HI> conquest.</P>
<P>(5) In all this discourse touching the beginning and setling of the State of <HI>Spain,</HI> it appears not from
whence she derives her several names of <HI>Iberia, Hesperia,</HI> and <HI>Hispania.</HI> It seems they are more an|cient
than the entrance of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> and therefore they allow us no certain Story, nor other
reason indeed, more than likely conjecture: and in some scarce that. Her first name of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eria</HI> was
given by her ancients, from a River that runs almost through the middle of the Countrey; So saith
<HI>Maginus,</HI> and relies upon <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Iustin</HI> for his Authors. Others give it rather to the <HI>Iberi,</HI> the anci|ent
people of <HI>Asia,</HI> thas came in under <HI>Panus</HI> from toward <HI>Syria,</HI> and possest it before the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI>
Her second name admits as much question: Some fetch it from <HI>Hesperus</HI> the brother of <HI>Atlas,</HI> and
their twelfth King from <HI>Tubal&punc;</HI> Others beyond the Moon from the Evening star, because it is situate up|on
the West of <HI>Europe.</HI> The last <HI>Hispania</HI> is supposed from one <HI>Hispanus</HI> or <HI>Hispalus,</HI> who reigned in
those parts, and was the third in the account of some from <HI>Tubal:</HI> or else from <HI>Hispalis,</HI> now <HI>Seril:</HI>
rather we may take it from the fore-mentioned <HI>Panus,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Iberians,</HI> by the prefiction of an
S. for so the <HI>Greeks</HI> give it <GAP DESC="foreign">, and since by their own addition and corruption, it is made <HI>Espa|nia,
Hispania.</HI></P>
<P>(6) Her whole compass is reckoned to be 1893 <HI>English</HI> miles: and her bounds are Seas on every
side, unless on the East towards <HI>France,</HI> from which she is severed by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Mountains. On
the West the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, on the North the <HI>Cantabrick,</HI> and on the South the <HI>Fretum Herculeum,</HI>
and other of the <HI>Mediterraneum,</HI> which divide her from <HI>Africa.</HI> Her Rivers of note are specially,
(1) <HI>Minius</HI> of <HI>Mingo.</HI> (2) <HI>Dorio</HI> now <HI>Duerus.</HI> (3) <HI>Tagus</HI> now <HI>Taio,</HI> famous for her golden sands.
(4) <HI>Botis</HI> or <HI>Guadilquiver.</HI> (5) <HI>Iberius</HI> now <HI>Ebro;</HI> and (6) <HI>Ana</HI> or <HI>Guadiana,</HI> which in one place
glides under ground for fifteen miles together, and gives the <HI>Spaniard</HI> an occasion (as he will catch at
<PB N="123" REF="257">
any) to brag that they have ten thousand Cattel daily feeding upon one bridge. Yet give them their
own sense, the truth may be questioned; For they have not such plenty of meat, as they have of sawce.</P>
<P>(7) It yields indeed abundance of Oranges, Lemmons, Capers, Dates, Sugar, Oyl, Honey, Licorish,
Horses. It hath been heretofore noted for rich Mines, insomuch that <HI>Hannibal</HI> received daily 3000
from one Mine in <HI>Spain.</HI> The number is not answerable in proportion to other Regions of <HI>Europe.</HI>
Their Cities not so great, nor so many. The reason may be, because indeed their Women are not so
fertile to multiply among themselves, and their usage of strangers so uncivil, that very few of other
Countries seat themselves there, as in <HI>France, England,</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> And yet they have of late times
sent many Colonies abroad into both <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>(8) They are extreamly proud, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">illiest of them pretend to a great portion of wisdom, which
they would seem to express in a kind of reserved state, and silent gravity, when perhaps their wit will
scarce serve them to speak sense. But if once their mouths be got too open, they esteem their breath
too precious to be spent upon any other subject than their own glorious actions. They are most un|just
neglecters of other Nations, and impudent vain flatterers of themselves. Superstitious beyond any
other people: which indeed commonly attends those which affected to be accounted religious&punc; rather
than to be so. For how can hearty devotion stand with cruelty, lechery, pride, Idolatry, and those
other Gothish, Moorish, Iewish, Heathenish conditions, of which they still savour?</P>
<P>(9) Yet it hath yielded heretofore men very famous for their excellent endowments, both of wit
and Religion. The Apostle himself expresseth a great desire to see <HI>Spain,</HI> as hoping to do much good
among those which had entertained the name of Christ. <HI>Osius</HI> a learned Bishop in the time of <HI>Constantine</HI>
the Great: And <HI>Pacianus</HI> mentioned by S. <HI>Hierome, Isidore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ulgentiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, Arius, Montanus, Tostatus</HI> and

Ferdinand</HI> the Catholick, and <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour were <HI>Spaniards.</HI> To this day it breeds good
Souldiers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">low, but sure, and successful in their Conquests. Yet such as prevail more by art than valour.
Their continual scarcity of victuals inureth them to hunger and other hardness, which oft times
wearieth out their enemy, and makes him yield at least to their patience if not to their strength.</P>
<P>(10) She hath been subject to many divisions, according to the humour of those that have been her
Lords. The first of note was made by the <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Citeriorem,</HI> which lay nearest to their Territo|ries,
and <HI>Vlteriorem,</HI> which was all the extent, beyond the River <HI>Iberus ad fretum usque Herculeum.</HI>
The second was by them too, in <HI>Baeticum</HI> the whole tract beyond the River <HI>Ana</HI> South-ward. (2) <HI>Lu|sitanium</HI>
Northward, toward the <HI>Cantabrick</HI> Ocean, and (3) <HI>Terraconensem</HI> Eastward, joyning upon
<HI>France.</HI> When the <HI>Moors</HI> enjoyed it, they rent it into twelve parcels, a multitude of petty royal|ties.
<HI>Arragon, Catalonia, Valentia, Castile, Toledo, Biscay, Leon, Gallicea, Murcia, Navarre, Corduba,</HI> and
<HI>Portugal.</HI> And these yet retain the name of Kingdoms, but their government was long ago recover|ed
into the hands of five, which bare the titles of <HI>Castile, Arragon, Granada, Navarre,</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI>
It was of latter times contracted into the three Kingdoms of <HI>Arragon, Castile,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> but is in
the power of one King, called the Catholick King of <HI>Spain.</HI> We stand to this last division as most
proper for our times, and best befitting my brief Discourse. Give me leave to add the Islands which
lie near to each Kingdom.</P>
<P>(11) The present state of <HI>Arragon</HI> comprehends three of those Kingdomes, as it was scattered by
the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Sarazens.</HI> (1) <HI>Arragon</HI> it self, which lieth on the South of <HI>Navarre,</HI> on the East of
<HI>Castile,</HI> on the North of <HI>Valentia,</HI> and the West of <HI>Catalonia.</HI> The ancient Inhabitants were the <HI>Iac|cetani,
Lutenses,</HI> and <HI>Celtiberi:</HI> her chief City <HI>Caesar Augusta. (2) Catalonia:</HI> It lieth betwixt&punc; <HI>Arragon</HI>
and the <HI>Pyren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> hills. It is supposed a mixt name from <HI>Gothi</HI> and <HI>Alani,</HI> people which heretofore
<PB N="125" REF="258">
possest it after the <HI>Vandals</HI> had lost their hold. The Region is but barren; yet it hath in it many Cities,
the chief <HI>Terra cona,</HI> which gave name to the whole Province, called by the <HI>Romans, Terraconenses.</HI>
(3) <HI>Valentia,</HI> which on the East is touched with the <HI>Mediterraneum,</HI> on the North with <HI>Castile,</HI> on the
South with the Kingdom of <HI>Murcia.</HI> It is reported for the most pleasant and fruitful Region in all
<HI>Spain;</HI> it hath her name from her chief City, and as <HI>Maginus</HI> relates, admits as yet of 22 thousand Fa|milies
of <HI>Moors.</HI> In this is the University where S. <HI>Dominick,</HI> Father of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> studied; and
the old <HI>Saguntum</HI> besieged by <HI>Hannibal,</HI> now <HI>Morvedre.</HI></P>
<P>(12) The state of <HI>Castile</HI> as now it stands, comprehends all the rest of those scattered Governments,
as were possest by the <HI>Moors, Portugal</HI> only excepted. And first <HI>Castile</HI> it self, both the old which
joyns with <HI>Arragon</HI> on the East of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the west of <HI>Navarre;</HI> and the new which toucheth
her upon the South. The first abounds not much with fruits, but yet it breeds many Cattel. The <HI>Me|tropolis</HI>
is <HI>Burgos,</HI> and the other chief are <HI>Salamanca,</HI> an University, and <HI>Valadolit,</HI> once the seat of the
Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> Now <HI>Castile</HI> abounds more with Corn, is watered with the River <HI>Tagus</HI> and <HI>Ana:</HI>
And in this stands the Kings chief Cities, <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Toledo,</HI> which was heretofore a propriatory of
it self. The rest that belong to <HI>Castile</HI> are 2. <HI>Toledo,</HI> however now but a City of new <HI>Castile,</HI> yet in the
division, her Territories spread themselves over a large compass. The City is in the midst of <HI>Spain.</HI>
It was the seat of the <HI>Gothish</HI> Kings, and successively of the <HI>Moorish</HI> Princes: now of the Arch-Bishops,
who exceed in Revenues any other Prelate in the world, except the <HI>Pope.</HI> Here hath sate eighteen
National Councils in the time of the <HI>Gothish</HI> Kings 3.</P>
<P>(13) <HI>Biscay,</HI> heretofore <HI>Cantabria,</HI> on the North of old <HI>Castile</HI> toward the Ocean, it was the last peo|ple
which yielded to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and after to the <HI>Moors.</HI> A Mountainous Countrey, but affords excel|lent
Timber for ships, and good Iron. Her Cities are S. <HI>Sebastian, Fonterabia,</HI> and <HI>Bilbao,</HI> which stands
but two miles from the Sea, and is noted for excellent Blades: some have been tried by the <HI>English</HI> up|on
their own Crests 4.</P>

Ocean, and on the South old <HI>Castile.</HI> The Region is reported to yield plenty of Gold, Vermili|on,
red Lead and other Colours, else she is barren, her inhabitants not many, and those live most upon
Hunting and Fishing. It is the title of the eldest Son of <HI>Castile,</HI> as <HI>Wales</HI> is to our Prince of <HI>England.</HI>
Her chief City is <HI>Oveido,</HI> which bears part with her in the name of a Kingdom; and indeed was the
Title of the first Christian King after the <HI>Moors</HI> Conquest.</P>
<P>(15) <HI>Gallicia,</HI> on the East joyns upon <HI>Leon,</HI> on the West it is bounded with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean,
on the North with the <HI>Cantabrick,</HI> and on the South with the River <HI>Mingo.</HI> It breeds Iennets in abun|dance,
insomuch that they have been Poetically feigned to be conceived by the wind. <HI>Niger</HI> writes,
that here hath been an incredible plenty of Gold, Lead, and Silver; that the Rivers are full of a mixt
earth, and that the Plough could scarce wag for clods of Golden Ore. There appears now no such
matter. The principal Cities are Saint <HI>Iago,</HI> where S. <HI>Iames</HI> the Apostle lieth buried, his Reliques
kept, worshipped, and visited by Pilgrims. And the other of note especially with us, is <HI>Corugna,</HI> an
excellent Port for Ships, and mentioned oft in our wars with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by the name of the <HI>Groyne.</HI>
Here likewise is the Promontory <HI>Nerius,</HI> called by our Mariners <HI>Capo de finis terrae.</HI></P>
<P>(16) <HI>Murcia,</HI> on the North hath new <HI>Castile;</HI> on the South and East the <HI>Spanish</HI> Seas. It is not
much peopled, but yet is famous for several commodities, especially for pure earthen Vessels, and fine
Silk. Heretofore it enriched the <HI>Romans</HI> with a daily supply of 25000 Drachmae of silver. Her chief
places are <HI>Alicante,</HI> whence our <HI>Alicant</HI> Wines come; and new <HI>Carthage</HI> oft commended by our Tra|vellers,
for her large and safe Haven; and lastly, <HI>Murcia,</HI> a Town which gives name to the whole
Region.</P>
<P>(17) <HI>Navarre</HI> lieth close to the <HI>Pirenaean</HI> Hills, and as <HI>Maginus</HI> gives it, is enclosed with Moun|tains;
and so it is North and East: on the West it hath the River <HI>Ebro,</HI> and on the South <HI>Arragon.</HI>

The <HI>Vascones</HI> are said to have lived here, who afterward placed themselves in <HI>France,</HI> and kept there
their name to this day of <HI>Vascones,</HI> corruptly <HI>Gascoigns.</HI> The chief Towns are <HI>Bampelme,</HI> the Metro|polis,
and <HI>Viana,</HI> the title of the <HI>Navarran</HI> Prince. <HI>Maginus</HI> sets the Revenue annual of this Kingdom
at 100000 Duckets.</P>

<P>(19) <HI>Portugal</HI> is the third Kingdom in our last division of <HI>Spain,</HI> and it may well be esteemed one
of her largest Territories: for it runs along the <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> from the borders of <HI>Gallicea,</HI> as

Her name some derive <HI>&agrave; portu Gallorum, Maginus</HI> rather <HI>&agrave; portu Cale,</HI> a Haven of that name
which was much frequented by Fishermen. It is almost the same portion of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was hereto|fore

<HEAD>The Description of ITALY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ITaly</HI> is divided from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> by the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and stretcheth her self South-East, betwixt
the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> and <HI>Adriatick</HI> Seas, almost in just proportion of a mans leg. I may spare my Rea|der
her lavish attributes, which he can hardly baulk, if he will but look into any Author where her
name is mentioned. She must (for me) and well may, be content here with the brief <HI>Elogy</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI>
to which (I think) the wit of man can add but little. Certainly the most blessed seat of man upon

<P>(2) Yet to speak truth we cannot abate her much of this title. The mother of Countries we may
call her, since most writers agree, that she was first inhabited by <HI>Ianus,</HI> (or <HI>Noah,</HI> as some would re|port
him) the Father of Nations. It was doubtless a very long time since the World was honest, and
deserved the name of a golden age: yet then was she peopled (as <HI>Iustin</HI> delivers out of <HI>Trogus</HI>) by the
<HI>Aborigines,</HI> whose King was first <HI>Ogyges,</HI> then <HI>Saturn,</HI> a man so just, that under his Government there
was known no tyranny from their Prince, no disloyalty from the Subject no injury from the Neigh|bour:
They had all one Patrimony, one possession: and where all acknowledge no peculiar, there
can be but little cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e of strife&punc;</P>
<P>(3) I presume not to set down the just year when men were thus ordered: But if you will believe
the story of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> compared in Chronology, by some of late years and better trust, as <HI>Munster,
Quade, &amp;c. Ianus pater hominum &amp; deorum,</HI> immediate predece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">or to <HI>Saturn,</HI> was in <HI>Italy</HI> within 200
years after the floud, and received the aged <HI>Chronus</HI> into part of his Kingdome with him, being ex|pulsed
by his son <HI>Iupiter</HI> out of <HI>Crete.</HI> Each of them built a City, and left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ound of his name for
<PB N="132" REF="262">
their remembrance: the one <HI>Ianua,</HI> which to this day hath suffered no farther change than to <HI>Genus:</HI>
and the other <HI>Saturnia;</HI> and both in their times gave name to the whole Region: which are not yet
fully worn out: though others have since took place; as <HI>Latium, quia hic latebat Saturnus; Italia ab
It alo Siculorum Rege. Hesperia</HI> from the Western star; <HI>Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">onia</HI> and <HI>Oenotria</HI> from her excellent Wines.</P>
<P>(4) But this is the largest scope which we can give to her Antiquity. <HI>Helvicus</HI> and other authentick
observers of time, cuts off (well nigh) a thousand years from this account of the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> and pla|ceth
their <HI>Dynastia</HI> 2622 years after the creation: 966 after the flood: and before Christ 1327.</P>
<P>(5) The first change of Inhabitants was forced by <HI>Evander</HI> the <HI>Arcadian,</HI> a man of that admirable
eloquence that he was called the son of <HI>Mercury,</HI> but had by chance slain his Father, and was there|fore
expulsed his inheritance, and advised into <HI>Italy</HI> by his Mother, a great Prophetess of those times.
He removed the <HI>Aborigines</HI> from their seat, and planted his companions in the same plot of ground,
where after <HI>Rome</HI> was built: and in the <HI>Mons Palatinus</HI> founded a little Town, which he called <HI>Pal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">auteum,</HI>
in memory of his great grand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">father. And this was about the year 2710.</P>
<P>(6) About 60 years after, <HI>Aeneas</HI> arrived in this Countrey from the siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> was entertained
as an amorous suitor by <HI>Lavinia,</HI> with consent of her Father <HI>Latinus:</HI> and after the death of his cor|rival
<HI>Turnus,</HI> King of the <HI>Rutilians,</HI> was setled heir to the <HI>Latin</HI> Monarchy after his Father.</P>
<P>(7) From <HI>Aeneas</HI> to <HI>Numitor</HI> the succession went on (not without some rubs) but suffered no great
breach for almost four hundred years: When the title should have fallen to him, being the elder and
true heir, he was spoiled of the Kingdom by his younger, <HI>Amulius Sylvius:</HI> nor could it be recover|ed,
till time had given growth and strength to <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus</HI> his grand-children, by his daugh|ter
<HI>Rhea.</HI></P>
<P>(8) The birth and breeding of these two brothers is well known, we need not enlarge their story
farther than thus. They were the sons of <HI>Rhea,</HI> a Virgin which was cloystered up into the Temple
<PB N="133" REF="262">
of <HI>Vesta,</HI> by her Uncle <HI>Amulius Sylvus,</HI> that she might not bring forth an heir to endanger his Title.
Notwithstanding means was found, so that she conceived at once two children by <HI>Mars,</HI> and was de|livered
among her Sister <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">stals.</HI> For this, her self (as the censure was upon such delinquents) was bu|ried
alive: her boys exposed to be destroyed: but were preserved by <HI>Faustulus</HI> the Kings Shepherd,
and nursed by his wife <HI>Laurentia,</HI> or <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pa,</HI> for her bad life.</P>
<P>(9) When years, and their supposed father had taught them their pedegree, and the base tyranny
of their Uncle; they began with revenge upon him, for their mothers quick burial: for their own
intended murder, and their Grandsires injury. To be brief, they slew their great Uncle <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lius
Sylvius,</HI> and turned the Kingdom to the rightful <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P>(10) Thus when they had once dealt in disposing of Empires, they could not easily return to the
Shepherds hook, but bethought them of the like fortune for their own advancement: and stirred
not far to make good their purpose, but in the very <HI>Mons Palatinus,</HI> the place where they suckt their
nurse, they drew together a monstrous head of debaucht Shepherds, and built the City, which is now
called <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>Romulus;</HI> who in strife for the name, or (as some say) for a disdainful skip over
the new walls, slew his brother <HI>Rhemus,</HI> and was left the sole Founder and Commander of this rascal
crew, for so indeed it was, and held in that contempt by their borderers, that they could not by in|treaty
get wives from them, to continue their succession, till by a guile they had enticed the <HI>Sabines</HI>
to their Pastimes, ravisht their women, and afterward by degrees either made their peace, or wan it
with the sword&punc; from the people round about them.</P>
<P>(11) Thus began the Empire of <HI>Rome:</HI> and was governed at first by 7 Kings in a direct succession
to <HI>Tarquinius Superbus,</HI> who lost both himself and Kingdom, by his own pride, and his Son <HI>Sextus</HI>
rape upon <HI>Lucretia.</HI> It was next taken up by Consuls, two annually chosen out of the <HI>Patritii,</HI> or
principal Citizens. The third rank were of <HI>Decemviri:</HI> but they again were dispossest for the
<PB N="134" REF="263">
like rape of <HI>Appius</HI> upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> and Tribunes were constituted of Consulary authority. Then Consuls
again in another course; and for a while Dictators; which when <HI>Caesar</HI> had once clapsed, he soon made
to himself a power Imperial: and (though after five years it cost him his life, which he enchanged
with <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius</HI> for 23 wounds in the Senate-house; yet) the liberty of <HI>Rome</HI> was never so
fully recovered, but that soon after the Government fell upon <HI>Angustus,</HI> by the death of <HI>Anthony</HI> and
deposing of <HI>Lepidus,</HI> who for a while were joyned with him into the <HI>Triumviratus.</HI></P>
<P>(12) Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s hold was scarce ever lost clearly to this day: though by the changing of the seat Impe|rial
from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Bizantium,</HI> in the reign of their forty third <HI>Constantinus:</HI> by the division into the
Eastern and Western, in the time of <HI>Theodotius:</HI> by the many invasions of the <HI>Goths, Huns, Vandals,
Alani, Burgundians</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> it comes now far short of that full glory in which it once shi|ned.</P>
<P>(13) Yet is <HI>Italy</HI> still as before a happy soyl, pleasant and fertile: at all times moderate weather
and healthful air: full of variety as well of living creatures, as Plants, Corn, Wine, Oyl, Linnen,
Herbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And can afford into other Countries, Rice, Silks, Velvets, Sattins, Taffataes, Grogram,
Rash, Fustians, Gold-wire, Armour, Allom, Glasses, &amp;c. The rich are very rich: for wealth will
come, with much labour, in great abundance: but the poor are extream poor; for they are most of
them very idle.</P>
<P>(14) Her chief Rivers are <HI>Padus</HI> or <HI>Poe, Athesis, Rubica, Tyberis, Arnus, &amp;c.</HI> And her chief
Mountains are the <HI>Alps,</HI> and <HI>Mons Appennius.</HI> The first are in height 5 dayes journey, covered with
snow, and from thence have their name <HI>&agrave; nivibus albis.</HI> They have two passages from <HI>Germany</HI> into

through <HI>Provence</HI> and <HI>Liguria:</HI> through the hills <HI>Genura</HI> to <HI>Lombardy:</HI> and through the Countrey of

indeed <HI>Spina.</HI> The measure of <HI>Italy</HI> is from North-west to South-East about 1020 miles, and from
the two Seas cross in some places 410.</P>
<P>(15) The Inhabitants are of a sad temper, solid judgement, witty, Politick, and frugal: yet they are
as deeply engaged to their peculiar vices; hot letchers, and those seldome stand quit from that horri|ble
torture of jealousie over their Wives, for it measures others actions by its own rule&punc; Both in them
are incredible; and makes treachery and murder seem no fault in their eye, if they be provoked by
suspition. Little friendship with them but for advantage; and a man must beware that he venter not
farther upon those terms, than he may well step back, lest he be betrayed (perhaps forced) to a love
worse than their hate; for they are most unnatural in their lust. The Women when they have their
free liberty differ not much, but their close keeping either hinders, or at least hides their faults, so as
they appear modest, lovely, and witty, for as much as they dare speak.</P>
<P>(16) For war and learning, it bred in times past the mirrour of both; <HI>Camillus, Fabius Maximus,
Scipio, Pompey, Caesar, Cicero, Livie, Tacitus, Virgil, Ovid,</HI> and many hundreds which yet prompt our
tongues and pens with examples of goodness in several kinds. Nor hath it lost that glory in this age;
For that Nation directs not their travellers into these parts, to see, hear, and partake of their ex|cellent
learning, though they compass it with great expence, and venture through dangerous haz|zards,
by reason of their treacherous dispositions, and cruel barbarous usage of such as shall in any
light circumstance seem to be averse from their idolatrous suspition. But their Universities are ma|ny,
and very famous; <HI>Rome, Ferrara, Naples, Salernum, Venice, Padua, Verona, Florence, Millain, Man|tua,

<P>(18) The first is the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> in the South part of <HI>Italy,</HI> and is the most fertile: it is
bounded with the Seas, unless on that side towards the <HI>Papacy.</HI> It is of large compass, and compre|hends
many Provinces. (1) <HI>Campania faelix,</HI> or <HI>terra laboris,</HI> and in this stands <HI>Naples</HI> the Metropo|polis:

there built Cities, and possest a great part of the Countries. The principal of note was <HI>Tarentum. (5)
Terra Di Otranto,</HI> for her Metropolis <HI>Otranto,</HI> once <HI>Hydruntun.</HI> And here stands <HI>Brundusi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m,</HI> famous for
one of the best Havens in Christendom. (6) <HI>Puglia,</HI> and her chief City was <HI>Arpinum, Tully's</HI> birth-place.</P>
<P>(19) The Land of the <HI>Church</HI> lieth on the West of <HI>Naples,</HI> and South-East of the Common-wealth
of <HI>Venice:</HI> North and South she crosseth from the <HI>Adriatique</HI> to the <HI>Tuscau</HI> Sea. Her under-Provin|ces

born. (4) Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Patrimony, a large portion: and I believe more than ever he enjoyed, or
could leave to his heirs. Her ancient Towns, well known and oft mentioned in the <HI>Roman</HI> Stories,

will not repeat her beginning: she was then but two miles in compass: but after she grew far, she
burnished to 50 miles about; upon the walls 740 Turrets, and the Inhabitants innumerable. For
those memorable actions which were performed in her under the Antique Empire, we will refer the
Reader to a particular Description, derived wholly to that purpose. As it is now, it stands somewhat
lower on the banks of <HI>Tiber,</HI> in the <HI>Campus Maetins:</HI> she retains yet 11 miles round, and 200000
Inhabitants, a great part Friars, and such odd idle fellows, which pretend to Religion, for want of
other means to live: cloyster themselves up to a single life, only to avoid the charge and incum|brances
of marriage, not to separate themselves from the world, or desires of the flesh: for among
them they maintain commonly 40000 Curtizans in good custome, and so rich, that they are able to
pay 30000 Duckets yearly to the Pope. The buildings in which they most glory in, are the Church
of Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> the Castle of Saint <HI>Angelo,</HI> the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library, and the Popes Palace. The truth is,
there is pride enough to attire the Whore of <HI>Babylon,</HI> as there can hardly be any other meant than
<HI>Rome:</HI> she sits upon the Beast with seven heads: for she was built upon seven Hills, <HI>Palatinus, Capi|tolinus,
Viminalis, Aventinus, Esquilinus, Caelius Quirinalis;</HI> was ruled first by seven Kings, and
hath been since subject to seven several forms of Government; if you joyn the Popedom to those
former which I have now mentioned.</P>
<P>(20) The Common-wealth of <HI>Venice,</HI> on the North of the Papacy, is a large Territory, and is
now as famous for State-policy, as it hath been heretofore glorious for warlike atchievements. The
Inhabitants were first a people of lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> and assisted their neighbour <HI>Trojans</HI> in their ten years
quarrel with the <HI>Greeks.</HI> So long since they were known by the name of <HI>Heneti:</HI> and that differs not
much from <HI>Veneti</HI> as they are now called. Though they have a Duke, yet it is a free State, and go|verned
by an <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">istarchy:</HI> for he is ordered to the very cloaths on his back, by a certain number of the

(little enough to keep him from the thought of tyranny) about 40000 Duckets by the year. The City
it self is eight miles round, built upon 72 Islands, five miles from the firm land, but for convenience of
passage is alwayes furnisht with Boats, and hath 4000 Bridges. Their <HI>Arsnal</HI> keeps in continual

<HEAD>The Description of the Kingdom of HUNGARY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not without example of good authoriy, if I take into this Description, not only that part which
is now more peculiarly known by the name of <HI>Hungary:</HI> but the whole Country likewise of <HI>Dar|cia,</HI>
which was once one with it, though time and fortune have at last severed them: so that each hath
now its own Princes, Laws, Customes, Language and Religion, different from other.</P>
<P>I the rather take to my self this leave, to avoid both the charge and trouble of ordering for every
one a several Table.</P>
<P>(2) First then the Kingdom of <HI>Hungaria</HI> is on the South-East of <HI>Germany&punc;</HI> and joyns upon the
Dukedom of <HI>Austria.</HI> They heretofore divided betwixt them the Countrey of <HI>Pannonia. Austria</HI> was
the <HI>superior,</HI> and this the <HI>inferior Pannonia.</HI> The government and titles are now dis-joyned; and <HI>Au|stria</HI>
hath got the start in power; for she is the mother of many <HI>German</HI> Princes, and hath drawn
the crown Imperial almost into a succession.</P>
<P>(3) Yet is <HI>Hungary</HI> still an absolute Kingdom; and if not so rich and populous as heretofore, it
must not take from her honour, since her fortunes sunk not through want of valour, and fault of her
former Inhabitants; but we have been for a long time exposed to hazzard in the defence of Christen|dome
against the mis-believing <HI>Turks:</HI> and for that it hath been by some stiled the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">k-pit of the
world, where once in a year at least a prize is played, and some ground either won or lost by either
party.</P>
<P>(4) The first Inhabitants of this Country were the <HI>Pannones;</HI> those were expulsed by the <HI>Gothes.</HI>
And when the <HI>Gothes</HI> went into <HI>Italy,</HI> it was le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t to the possession of the <HI>Hunni,</HI> a <HI>Scythian</HI> people,
which lived before near the <HI>Pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">otis;</HI> and when they saw their time, changed their seat: and a|bout
the year three hundred seventy three&punc; brake by great multitudes into these parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> which
<PB N="143" REF="267">
they held till they were displaced by the <HI>Lombards.</HI> These last were the <HI>Winnili,</HI> which lived in <HI>Scan|dia</HI>
or <HI>Scandinaria,</HI> a Northern <HI>Peninsula,</HI> betwixt the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Seas. Their seat it seems
was too barren for their number, and meer want of Victuals forced them to seek better sustenance
in some other quarter. They over-ran many Countries, e're they could find any one to their con|tent:
Among the rest the <HI>Parnonia</HI> had her course: and here they continued till they marched into
<HI>Italy,</HI> under the command of <HI>Alboinus,</HI> where, after 200 years, their Kingdom was ruined by <HI>Char|lemain.</HI></P>
<P>(5) When it was thus left by <HI>Lombards,</HI> the <HI>Hunnes</HI> returned to their former seat: and after some
time of rest, grew up to a great Nation, able to encounter the <HI>Roman Macrinus,</HI> to break his forces, and
return victors from the battel. About the year 439. they chose for their King, <HI>Attyla,</HI> whose inscri|ption
was, <HI>Attyla Mundizi filius, &amp; Magni Nim: nepos Engadiae natus, divin&acirc; benignitate, Hunnorum,
Medorum, Gothorum, ac Danor um, metus orbis, Deique flagellum:</HI> An insolent title; but indeed he was
victorious over most parts of the then known world, and bethought himself of enlarging his Territo|ries
in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa:</HI> But that design was drowned in wine and Lust; which at length brought
him to a most miserable destruction; For in the night time, when he had filled himself with both,
as he lay by his Concubine, with his face upward in a dead sleep, his nose gusht a bleeding, and ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ked

<P>(6) Since this setling, they were once more disturbed by the <HI>Lombards,</HI> and after by <HI>Charles</HI> the
Great; so that they were not well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">astned in their possession of this Countrey, till the time of the
Emperour <HI>Arnulphus,</HI> about the year 900. And indeed at this day hardly enjoy it, by reason of the in|credible

she yields Corn thrice in one year, almost without any tillage or care of the husbandman. Fruit of
all kinds in great abundance, and Grapes which make an excellent, wholsome, and rich Wine. It
breeds Cattel in such plenty, that this one Countrey, besides store for her own Inhabitants, sends Sheep
and Oxen into for eign Nations, which lye about her: and might (say they) suffice to feed all <HI>Europe</HI>
with flesh. Venison is not here any Dainty: Does, Hares, Goats, Boars, are every mans meat:

<P>(9) The earth is enricht with variety of Mines, which yields her plenty of Iron, Steel, Copper,
Silver and Gold: Lead she hath not, and scarce at all any Tin. Her Rivers are equally commodious,

The chief and only one indeed, which belongs properly to this Region, is <HI>Tibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cus</HI> or <HI>Teissa:</HI> and this

that two parts of it are water, and a third Fish. The rest which are common to this, with other Coun|tries,

and in some places cast up a sand mixt with very good Gold. Here are besides many waters of excel|lent
vertues; whereof some turn wood into Iron, others Iron into Brass: some very medicinal for
sundry diseases: others again so pestiferous, that they kill the creature which doth but taste them.

for their habitation, which (after long travel) here they found fittest for their security, as being a <HI>Pen|insula</HI>
fenced almost round with Seas, from the force of all foreign Enemies. Yet here too they met at
last with a worse danger, which they could less resist. For the main <HI>Ocean</HI> brake into a great part of the
Countrey, displaced many of their Colonies, and sent them Petitioners to <HI>Rome</HI> for a dwelling within
her Dominions: but their entreaty being with some neglect denied, it kindled the sparks, which to
this time had lain (as it were) dead in a dejected Nation, and <UNCLEAR>now</UNCLEAR> they break out into flames, which
stirred them&punc; to require that by force of Arms&punc; which they could not request by submissive Oratory.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="273">(4) Hence grew their first quarrel with the <HI>Romans,</HI> which they put on with that courage and suc|cess,
that they were emboldened at last to assault the very City, with so strong Forces, that the glory
of it began to shake, and had shattered to pieces, had not the victory followed rather the fortune of one
<HI>Marius,</HI> than the valour of the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Legions: and that too (as some relate it) was bought of
his heathenish gods at a dear rate, by the bloudy sacrifice of his own daughter. The great and most me|morable
encounter was six hundred and forty years after the City was built, about an hundred and
eleven before Christ. And then indeed they received (in a manner) a fatal crush, which quelled them
for the present: yet not so, but that in after ages, they recovered strength and same: spread their victo|ries
over the most part of <HI>Europe:</HI> and left their name (for many years since that) in <HI>Italy</HI> it self.</P>
<P>(5) For without doubt those <HI>Cimmerii</HI> mentioned by <HI>Starbo,</HI> which lived on the North side of the
<HI>Appennine</HI> Mountains near <HI>Boianum,</HI> were of this stock, and of that note, as they gave occasion for
many Proverbs and Fables to both Greek and Latin Poets. It was a people which belike seldom saw
Sun, but lurked for the most part under ground, lived upon theft, and issued forth only in the night,
a season most fit for deeds of darkness: and so was their whole course, which caused our well known
Adage of <HI>tenebrae Cimmeriae pro densissim&acirc; caligine.</HI> The horrid dens, and dismal Rivers, which ran
by the place of their abode, bred at length a terrour in the silly Heathens, and was esteemed by
them, the passage down to their <HI>Elizium.</HI> So <HI>Homer</HI> gives it in the second of his <HI>Odysses,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI>
in his sixth of the <HI>Aeneidos:</HI> and here did <HI>Naso</HI> feign his house of sleep, <HI>Metamorph.</HI> 11.</P>
<L>Est prop&egrave; <HI>Cimmerios</HI> longo spelunca recessu</L>
<L>Mons <HI>Carus,</HI> ignavi domus &amp; penetralia Somni.</L>
<P>(6) Thus was their Original and progress for the first Age, whilst it continued i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the possession
<PB N="153" REF="273">
of the <HI>Cimmerians.</HI> The next which succeeded were the <HI>Saxons,</HI> a people no less famous; but since
their story hath been elsewhere remembred in our other Descriptions, it must give place here to the
third Invader the <HI>Danes,</HI> who whilst the <HI>Saxons</HI> were employed with us here in the Conquest of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
start out of those petty Isles in the <HI>Sinus Codanus,</HI> and took up their room in this <HI>Peninsula.</HI> There
they have continued to this day; and added other Territories to their Dominions: so that the then
<HI>Cimbria Chersonesus</HI> is but a parcel of the now Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> (as shall appear when we come
to her division) and that only which in our latter times is called <HI>Iuitland,</HI> and runs North ward in
form almost of a Hounds tongue into the <HI>Baltick Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>(7) The <HI>Danes</HI> (like enough) were at first one Nation with the <HI>Cimbri,</HI> but being together expul|sed
by the <HI>Scythians</HI> from their native soyl, they were severally dispersed, though not at any great di|stance.
These setled themselves in the Northern Isles, as the other did in their <HI>Chersonesus.</HI> The first
(at their removal) varied not their antique name of <HI>Cimbri:</HI> As for <HI>Chersonesus</HI> it is not peculiar to this
Country, being as common as <HI>Peninsula:</HI> for it imports no more than <GAP DESC="foreign">, &agrave;
<HI>terr&acirc; &amp; insul&acirc;:</HI> and of these there are many more, some perhaps of equal same. <HI>Taurica Chersonesus</HI> was
not far distant from the place of their first abode; <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> well known in <HI>Greece, Thracia, Cher|sonesus</HI>
in <HI>Thrace,</HI> and <HI>Aurea Chersonesus</HI> in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>(8) But the <HI>Danes</HI> it seems suffered some change as well in their name as fortunes. <HI>Saxo
Grammticus</HI> gives it to one <HI>Dan</HI> the son of <HI>Huniblus,</HI> which was their first Governour in
their new Commonwealth. But this is controuled by <HI>Reccanus</HI> (saith <HI>Quade</HI>) who renders
another <HI>Etymon,</HI> how likely, I leave to those, who can best judge by their skill in the <HI>Danish</HI>
Language. The <HI>Cimbri</HI> (saith he) when they were grown to great multitudes, bethought them|selves
of several names to distinguish their Colonies: Each following their own concei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> best
to express the quality, in which they most gloried. Among the rest, some there were
<PB N="154" REF="274">
which affecting at least the opinion of a valiant people, such as scorned riches without honour, honour
without victory, and victory without the bloud of their enemies; assumed their name from that crea|ture,
which Nature had marked out with this Character, <HI>Gallum igitur gallinaceum, tum bellicae laudis,

<P>(9) However the <HI>Etimon</HI> may be far fetcht, for ought I know, yet doubtless at this day they make
good the Elogy of a valiant and warlike Nation; strong of body, big boned, and of a terrible counte|nance,
ambitious of a glorious death, rather than a sluggish idle life. It is the saying of <HI>Valerius Maxi|mus,

and submitted to their Conquests in the time of <HI>Osbert</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> They were provoked
by a rape done upon the Sister of the <HI>Danish</HI> King: for which the poor <HI>English</HI> dearly paid, with two

enjoy the benefit of their magnanimity, under the personal conduct of the right valiant and illustri|ous

<P>(10) Their first Prince which established them a setled and civil government, was <HI>Gotricus,</HI> in the
year seven hundred ninety seven. Before it was but a confused state, and affords us little certainty of
their story. From that time the government hath been under a sole King, of equal power with the
greatest, though his Revenues are hardly answerable: His best profit is from a breach of the Sea,
which runs into the middle part of the Countrey, commonly called the <HI>Sound;</HI> which is a passage so nar|row,
that no shipping can pass that way, without the licence and favour of the Wathch-men: keeping
<PB N="155" REF="274">
Garrison there to receive the Imposts and Customs of the arriving Vessels for the King. It is easily ga|thered

into the River <HI>Vistula;</HI> with many others of lesser note, though all conduce to make the Countrey in
some kinds very fertile.</P>
<P>(7) For it abounds with most sorts of Corn and Pulse, sufficient both for their own spending, and
continual traffique into other Countries. Many of her neighbouring Regions could not well miss her
plenty, as well of Whet, Rie, and Barley, as Beeves and other Cattel, which gives supply to <HI>Saxony,</HI> and
the rest of <HI>Germany</HI> near hand, which hardly yield enough for their Inhabitants out of their own
store. The blessing of this fertility cannot come alone; but must needs bring with it the like riches
of butter, Cheese, Milk, Wax, Honey, and whatever else hath its birth from the ground. It is well nigh
past belief which is reported of the multitude of Bees, such as yield more Honey and Wax, than the
people can find room for: They need here neither Art, nor care of the good Huswife to order their
Hives, but naturally are their own Guardians, and provide so diligently for their own safety within
the bulks of trees, that they easily pass over the hardest winter without hurt. There is store of game,
both for hunting, fowling, and fishing. In her Forests is seen a kind of wild Horse with an horn like
an Harts, and the Alces, &amp;c. Lastly, among other good commodities, the worst is not her Pitch and
Rosin, which yield her a large annual revenue.</P>
<P>(8) Her chief wants proceed from her bleak situation; For it is a plain Countrey, and shadowed
for the most part with Woods: very cold, and by that means she hath little Oyl, and scarce Grapes
enough to teach them the use of Wine. A great defect among so good drinkers; for they have a
name for that equal with any part of <HI>Germany:</HI> and that I think gives no ground to the rest of <HI>Eu|rope:</HI>
But they make a shift to find themselves play with a kind of Metheglin, Gold or Silver here is
<PB N="164" REF="279">
not much, unless about <HI>Cracovia:</HI> and (as <HI>Maginus</HI> saith) in <HI>Sandomica,</HI> where there are likewise some
Mines found of the <HI>Lapis Lazulus,</HI> perfect Lead, and Iron, and pieces of Copper. Near the Towns
of <HI>Nochow</HI> and <HI>Palukie,</HI> there is extant a kind of Miracle, a certain Earth naturally formed up into
pots, which if you take forth and dry, they differ very little by sight from such as are made by hand,
and serve aptly for the same use.</P>
<P>(9) The Inhabitants, though they had but a wild beginning, yet in the more civil parts are of a
gentile behaviour to strangers, and not i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iurious one to the other. Theft is a voice not known to
the <HI>Polands:</HI> For they dare travel alone long journeys in the depth of Winter, with one poor one to
draw their sledge in the night times, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and this with more security and less danger, than we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ay
walk in our open streets in the dusk of Evening. Questionless, this special practise of honesty in that
kind, above other Nations, proceeds from an inbred desire which they generally have to be in em|ployment:
for they are very industrious in their several faculties. Those which pretend to Learning,
addict themselves much to the study of Languages. The Latine is familiar to the Gentry as their own:
(and as <HI>Maginus</HI> reports) is used in some Towns by rich and poor as their proper speech. They are
prodigal both in diet and apparel, give much entertainment, and keep a large retinue of servants.
In brief, they are as equal to themselves, as they are courteous to others; For they will not be oppres|sed
by the greatest Potenate either home bred or foreign. They are very vallant, and meet their ene|my
with an undaunted courage, be they never so much over-born either by number or strength. The
truth is, no Peasant is suffered to bear arms: only their Nobility and Gentry of place in their Com|mon
wealth: such as war, not for others only, and upon constraint, but have somewhat themselves
to lose: and therefore are ready as well for their own safety, as defence of their King and Country,
to set on upon all assays, and raise an incredible number of excellent Horse, well manned almost, in
an instant: For they are kept in continual motion by the <HI>Muscovite.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="279">(10) They have a good mind to Religion, but cannot fasten upon any one to their liking: and
therefore they will try all. Christians they have been ever since the year 965. but from that time, they
have scarce slipt any error, schisme, or heresie, which hath crept into the Church. Here are <HI>Iesuites,</HI>
and others of the Romish Sects; Here are <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Calvinists,</HI> and <HI>Arrians,</HI> and <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> and
<HI>Anti-trinitarians;</HI> none allowed, but all tollerated: and indeed <HI>Poland</HI> had the seniority of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
for that old saying, That if a man had lost his Religion, here he might find it. They have one ancient
custome in their Churches, which, methinks may well interpret our standing up at rehearsal of the
Creed; when the Gospel is reading, the Nobility and Gentry unsheath their Swords, and stand as it
were prepared to defend it with their lives against any which dare violate it.</P>
<P>(11) Their King is chosen by the general States, and is for the most part some great Warriour of
their neighbouring Princes: For they have no peace on their East limit, with <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI>
but what they make with the Sword. The Laws are only temporary Statutes, there are none funda|mental:
But when the King hath any great design in behalf of the Common wealth, he assembles a
Councel of the Nobility to assist him. His Revenues coming in, are thought to be about six hundred
thousand Crowns: and each quarter of his Kingdom maintains his expence for one quarter of the
year. Their first King was <HI>Boeslaus,</HI> crowned by <HI>Otho</HI> 3. in the year 1001. But the Regal dignity was
lost again to <HI>Boleslaus</HI> the Bold, who began his Reign 1078. but was deposed by the <HI>Pope,</HI> and no
other suffered to take up the Scepter and rule by the name of King, till the year 1295. The first of

<HEAD>The Description of the Kingdom of PERSIA.</HEAD>
<P>THis Empire was one of the first, and most potent in the Eastern world; and though since in
several ages, she hath felt the variety of fortunes, to which all Kingdomes are subject, and
been forced to deliver up her glory to the succeeding Monarchies of the <HI>Macedonians, Parthians,
Turks,</HI> and <HI>Sarazens;</HI> yet now at last is she recovered to her own heighth and greatness, and
the name of <HI>Persia</HI> reacheth farther than ever, if we take in, (as most Geographers do) the
Regions of <HI>Media, Assyria,</HI> and the rest; which were heretofore the seat of several illustrious
Kingdomes.</P>
<P>(2) Surely the first which inhabited any part of this compass, were the <HI>Medes,</HI> a people of great an|tiquity,
who reach both their original and name from <HI>Madai,</HI> the son of <HI>Iapheth:</HI> for it was not long
after the floud; that they were subdued by <HI>Ninus</HI> King of the <HI>Assyrians:</HI> one and t'other, <HI>Media</HI> I mean
and <HI>Assyria,</HI> though then they had apart their peculiar governments, yet both were but a parcel of this
Countrey, which is now known by the name of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>(3) To <HI>Ninus</HI> and his successors they continued faithful for many years, till the effeminate weakness
of <HI>Sardanapalus</HI> gave opportunity to the ambition of <HI>Belochus</HI> governour of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and <HI>Arbaces</HI> of
<HI>Media,</HI> to divide his Empire betwixt them, which they did in the year of the world three thousand
one hundred forty six; and then began the Monarchy of the <HI>Medes,</HI> which spread it self through the
the greatest part of <HI>Asia;</HI> and (for above two hundred years) gathered strength, till the time of <HI>Astia|ges,</HI>
who dreamed himself out of his Empire, as <HI>Iustine</HI> relates the story.</P>
<P>(4) <HI>Persia propri&egrave; dicta,</HI> from whence this whole Country at last took name, was at this time but
an obscure Kingdom in respect of what now it is, and tributary to the <HI>Medes.</HI> Her Prince was <HI>Cam|byses,</HI>
the Father of the great <HI>Cyrus,</HI> by <HI>Mandanes</HI> daughter to <HI>Astiages;</HI> when she was great, and expe|cted
<PB N="172" REF="283">
the time of her deliverance, her Father touched with a perplexed dream, that she made so much
water as would drown all <HI>Asia,</HI> interpreted it, that her issue should be the overthrow of his state;
and therefore delivered the child which was born to her, into <HI>Harpagus</HI> his charge to be destroyed,
and he to the Kings Herdsman, who (unawares to Both) preserved the guiltless infant, so that at
last he took revenge upon his cruel Grand-father, and laid a foundation for the <HI>Persian</HI> Monar|chy.</P>
<P>(5) In this attempt his anger wrought him no farther than his enemy: for he left the government
of <HI>Media</HI> still to <HI>Cyaxares</HI> the son of <HI>Astyages,</HI> and afterward married his daughter, joyned with him
in his conquests, and till his death gave him preheminence of title. They were both engaged in
the taking of <HI>Babylon,</HI> slaughter of <HI>Baltazar,</HI> and destruction of the <HI>Chald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ans:</HI> The Scripture gives
this victory to <HI>Darius Medus,</HI> who, as most hold, was no other than <HI>Cyaxares:</HI> and he only named as
the principal of the two while he yet lived, though <HI>Cyrus</HI> had his part in the action, after his Uncles
death enjoyed it as his own, and made perfect the Monarchy of the <HI>Persians</HI> in the year of the
world 3046.</P>
<P>(6) About thrity seven years after, the succession was broke for want of lawful heirs, to <HI>Cambyses</HI> their
second King; and therefore their Princes consulted to salute him, whose Horse first neighed at a set
meeting upon the Court green, before the Sun-rising. <HI>Darius Histaspes</HI> was one, and by the subtiliy
of his Horse-keeper carried the Crown; for the night before, in the same ground, he had coupled a
Mare with the Horse that his Master should ride, which when the lustful Steed missed the next morn|ing,
being full of spirit, no sooner had he set footing upon the place, but with much eagerness he snuf|fed
and neighed after his Mare, and gave the quue to the other Princes to proclaim <HI>Darius</HI> King of
the Persians. This was he whom the Scripture calls <HI>Ahasuerus:</HI> he was <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sters</HI> husband.</P>
<P>(7) Thus is the Empire now setled, and entailed by descent after him to that famous <HI>Xerxes,</HI> who
<PB N="173" REF="283">
made war upon <HI>Greece,</HI> with an incredible Army, joyned Asia to Europe with a bridge, and dammed
up <HI>Hellespont</HI> with his Navy; yet was at last vanquished by four thousand at <HI>Thermopyle,</HI> and after by
Themistocles forced to make his flight in a small boat towards his own Countrey, contemned of his sub|jects,
and within a few years slain in his Palace by <HI>Artabanus.</HI> His immediate successour was <HI>Arta|xerxes
Lengimanus,</HI> who. sent the Prophet <HI>Esdras</HI> to re-edifie the Temple, and so on to <HI>Darius</HI> the last
<HI>Persian</HI> of. that course, who was ost vanquished by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and left the Monarchy of the
world to the <HI>Macedonians:</HI> After the death of their victorious Captain, it was divided among many
of the most potent Princes of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>(8) But when the <HI>Persians</HI> saw the force of their enemy thus severed, they began to conceive a
hope of recovering their liberty; and so they did indeed under the conduct and command of the <HI>Par|thian
Arsaces,</HI> but. found themselves little bettered in their condition, as being now become new slaves
to a more harsh tyrant; and therefore in the year two hundred twenty eight after the Incarnation,
they made a second attempt to quit themselves from the <HI>Parthians;</HI> they took their time, when
their Masters were sore afficted with a strong enemy from <HI>Rome,</HI> which had broke their Forces to
their hands; so that by the admirable prowess of another <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> they made good their Con|quest
upon the <HI>Parthians,</HI> and adventured so far with the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves, that their name began
to grow terrible, and the Emperour <HI>Constantine</HI> forced to fortifie his Provinces, which lay towards
the East; and his might be some cause too, why he removed his seat to <HI>Constantinopolis.</HI></P>
<P>(9) After this fell into the hands of the Saracenical Caliphs, in the year six hundred thirty four,
and to the <HI>Turks</HI> in the year one hundred and thirty, next to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and so again to the <HI>Par|thians,</HI>
by the help of <HI>Gempsas,</HI> who redeemed both his own and this from the <HI>Tartarian;</HI> and
briefly after many turns, it became the possession of <HI>Isma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l Sophy</HI> of <HI>Persia</HI> whose race continues it to
this day.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="284">(10) The bounds of this Empire on the North are the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and the River <HI>Oxus;</HI> on the

which they freely posses in <HI>Asia,</HI> they attempted the nearest parts of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> which cost
them the first fall from their Monarchy. <HI>Nec enim petituri Macedones Persidem vide bantur, in priores Persae
Graeciam provocassent,</HI> faith <HI>Vadianus.</HI> Their customes are most of them superstitious, but they held
nothing almost in so great reverence as water: it might not lawfully be soyled, so much as with a
soul hand; but to piss, or cast rubbish, or a dead carcass into the Rivers, was a kind of Sacriledge.
They had many Wives, and more Concubines: for they were exceeding desirous of increase, and
great rewards were appointed by their King himself, for him that could most augment the number of
his subjects in one year. They seldome entred into any consultation of State, till they had well arm|ed
themselves with drink; for then they thought they should be more free to speak what they most
thought. To spit, or laugh before their Prince, was a crime well nigh unpardonable: some say that
<PB N="175" REF="284">
they bury not their dead, but cast them forth to be devoured by wild beasts, and thought him most
happy which was soonest torn to mammock; the rest their friends bewailed, as such who had lived
impurely; and were therefore by this sign declared worthy of hell only, without any redemption.</P>
<P>(13) Their Philosophers were called <HI>Magi,</HI> and studied principally the art of fore-telling things to

making of Silks, which they send into all the Eastern Countries in great abundance. They are mild
and courteous to Strangers, yet jealous of their Wives, which for the most part are very fair and richly
attired; not withstanding their affection to them <HI>usque ad insanam Zelotypiam;</HI> yet are they much
addicted to that beastly sin of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and have their Stews on purpose, whither they resort without

<HEAD>The Description of the TURKISH EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Turk</HI> is admired for nothing more, than his sudden advancement of so great an Empire. For
before these three hundred and odd years, we must seek this people (which is become now a
terrour to the whole world) lurking in the by-corners of <HI>Asia,</HI> like runnagates and thieves, as in|deed
they were; such as so infested their neighbours with rapines and murders, as that they neither
enjoyed their own lives freely, nor possest more wealth than they could maintain with the sword.</P>
<P>(2) The great <HI>Osmand</HI> was. the first which redeemed them from obscurity: his Predecessors were
scarce mentioned as a Nation worth story; and therefore it is not easie to give their true original, or set
justly the place of earth from whence they sprang. There are which say from the <HI>Caspain</HI> mountains;
and that in the time of the <HI>Macedo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">asilius,</HI> they served the <HI>Sarazens</HI> in their <HI>Indian</HI> Wars, but
turned the Victory to their own advantage: for when they had once tryed their strength, and found
their Forces sufficient in behalf of others, they bethought themselves at last, to use them for their own
advancement; and to that purpose, turned head first upon their pay masters, out of whose spoils they
raised incredible Armies, which over-spread all <HI>Asia,</HI> to the very <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea. Others again conjecture,
that they were a <HI>Scythian</HI> people; and the rather, for that they made their way into these parts
through <HI>Pontus</HI> and <HI>Cappadocia</HI> and so on, as it were in a direct course from <HI>Scythia.</HI> The truth is,
the customs of both are not much unlike, their habit very near, and their wars waged with the same
weapons and discipline.</P>
<P>(3) But admit their first attempt upon the <HI>Sarazens:</HI> yet were they again scattered by their civil
dissention, lived as before, and could not be recollected into a Nation, till <HI>Othoman</HI> took upon him
to be their Leader in the year 1300, a man of as low birth and fortunes as the meanest, but had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="181" REF="287">
spirit, and an able wit may weild it: which put upon this great action, to conquer the
world, and suffered him not to rest in it, till he had seated himself in an Empire, which his progeny
enjoy to this day. He began with a rascal crew of such as were led on by want, and seemed rather to
bear Arms in defence of their privy thests, than with intent to invade an enemy: for he appeared
not at first as an open Warriour, but wrought his spoils by stratagems and sleights, and clandestine
excursions, upon such as were unprovided for resistance; possest himself of mountains and woods, as
lay most convenient for his lurking practises, and whither he might retire safe, if at any time he
were pursued.</P>
<P>(4) By these means he was content for a while, to encrease his wealth and power, which soon grew
to that eminency, as in few years he durst meet a strong enemy to the face; buckle with him upon
his own ground, for his possessions, and at last so prevailed where ever he set footing, that he scarce
stept back till he claspt into his own government, <HI>Pontus</HI> and <HI>Cappadocia, Galathia</HI> and <HI>Bythinia, Pam|philia</HI>
and <HI>Licia,</HI> and <HI>Phrygia,</HI> and all <HI>Asia minor,</HI> to the <HI>Greek</HI> Seas: to which
his successors
have in latter times added many other Countries of <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> so that it is now become
the most potent and tyrannical Empire of the world.</P>
<P>(5) The first of State was at <HI>Prussia</HI> in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> from thence it was removed <HI>Hadrianopolis,</HI>
and at last to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> a City of <HI>Greece</HI> in the Province of <HI>Romania.</HI> His Palace is called <HI>Sera|glio</HI>
is built in the most eminent part of the Town, contains three miles in circuit within the walls,
and surpasseth all other Courts under Heaven for Majesty, and number of buildings, for pleasurable
gardens, sweet fountains, and rich furniture. The Emperour himself hath for his common Guard
four thousand footmen, the sons of tributary Christians, which are called <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> and their Cap|tain
<HI>Agu,</HI> besides ten thousand others, dispersed under several Commanders through divers
parts of the Empire: and fifteen thousand Hersemen in ordinary pay. In these numbers, I

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eckon not those multitudes of <HI>Timariotae,</HI> which are assigned to several of the <HI>Turkish</HI> States; and deli|ver
incredible sums of money into his Treasury. As his wealth is great, so is his life luxurious; fifteen
hundred women are cloystered up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or his pleasure, and out of them one hundred and fifty c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lled as

<P>(6) The Ministers of State are (1) <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ti,</HI> who interprets their Law, and laies open their <HI>Alcoran,</HI>

<HI>Cadilescheri</HI> have under them peculiar Iudges of every Province, which are called <HI>Cadi,</HI> and are cho|sen
at their pleasure, but confirmed by the Emperour himself. (3) The third rank are <HI>Vizer Passa,</HI>
their Emperours Council; their chief is <HI>Vizer Azem,</HI> a man of great power through all the dominions
of the <HI>Turk:</HI> and for the most part, present at his treaties of State. (4) The fourth order are the <HI>Begler|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gs,</HI>
whose office answers almost to our Generals, and as the Iudges were, so are these placed in the
three several quarters of the Empire: one in <HI>Greece</HI> for <HI>Europe:</HI> a se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ond in <HI>Anatolia</HI> for <HI>Asia;</HI> and the
third is an Admiral of the Seas, and commands those parts which are left by the other two: all of
equal respect and place with <HI>Vizer bassa.</HI> Those of inferiour rank, and pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y employments in the
Common-wealth are almost innun erable, many of them not natives, but apostate Christians, and in
conditions, differ as the Countries from whence they first sprang.</P>
<P>(7) The multitude, I mean the born <HI>Turks,</HI> savour still of their barbarous Ancestors, and carry
the marks in their fore-heads, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mbs of <HI>Scythians</HI> and <HI>Tartars:</HI> They are for the most part broad|aced,
strong-boned, well-proportioned, dull and heavy-headed, of gross understanding, idely dispo|sed;
<PB N="183" REF="288">
and yet greedy of wealth, luxurious in their diet, and beastly in their lustful affections, without
distinction of kindred or sex, base minded, slaves to themselves and their superiours in their own
Country; yet ignorantly proud, and contemptuous of other Nations, which they take in soul scorn,
should be compared with their lubberly Inhabitant. They pass not to couzen a Christian in their course
of traffique; nor do they think they are bound to keep promise unless it make for their advantage.
The greatest part they have by due desert, is their strict obedience to the discipline of war: no sediti|on,
no tumult, no chat in their Camp or March, insomuch that oft-times many thousands on a sud|den
surprize their enemies unawares, with so very little noise, as not to be heard in their approach.
No difficulty can be demanded, which they are not ready to perform, without any respect at all had
to the danger; be it to pass Rivers, top Mountains, scale Walls, stand Centinel: In brief, they are not
to eat or sleep in War, but at full leisure; and are the truest military men upon earth.</P>
<P>(8) No great marvel then, if with so great multitudes, so well ordered, they daily improve their
Empire upon the Christians, who are not so zealous in defence of their true faith as these mis belie|vers,
bold and fool-hardy to uphold their false god. But the truth is, their superstitious credulity of
fate, which they think hath immutably prefixed every mans hour for life or death, which he can nei|ther
defer nor hasten, makes them fearless to incur dangers, and careless for their own security.</P>
<P>(9) Divers Schools they have, where their chief study is the imperial Laws; from thence some are

and his Mother a faithless <HI>Iew.</HI> Betwixt them they sent into the world a pernicious deceiver
(which none but two such Religions could have made up) in the year five hundred ninety seven.
When he had been for a while thus instructed by his distracted Parents, poverty, and hope to improve
his Fortunes, perswaded him from his Native soyl, to live for another while among true professed
Christians, where he received so much knowledge of the world, and light of the Gospel, as to pervert
it to his destruction, and ruin of many millions of souls.</P>
<P>(11) In his first adventurous travels abroad, he fell into the hands of theevish <HI>Sarazens,</HI> which sold
him to a <HI>Iewish</HI> Merchant; and he employed him to drive his Camels through <HI>Egypt, Syria, Palestine,</HI>
and other Forein Countries, where he still gathered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arther instructions of that truth which he in|tended
to abuse. His wickedness first brake forth into fraud, open theft, and rapine, and other sins
of highest rank; in which he continued and seduced others, till the death of his Master, and after mar|ried
his aged, but rich mistress.</P>
<P>(12) He had means now to act his malicious purposes, and wealth to countenance his exceeding
pride, which would not be satisfied with any lower ambition than to be called a Prophet of God.
This he began to practise, by the counsel of one <HI>Sergius</HI> a Monk, who being cast out for Heresie from
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> betook himself into <HI>Arabia,</HI> and joyned in with <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to make up this mischief per|fect:
see now their juggling. There wanted not craft betwixt them, to make use of his worst actions
to gull the simple: For when by his debaucht drinking and gluttony, he was fallen into an Epilepsie,
and in his fits lay Bear-like groveling, and foaming upon the earth, as one without sense, he preten|ded
an extatick swound&punc; wherein his soul was rapped from his body, whilst he converst with <HI>Gabriel,</HI>
an Angel from Heaven. To make this familiarity with God the more to be believed, he had bred up
a Dove to take her meat from his ear, which he most blasphemously professed to be the holy Ghost,
which at such times, and in that shape, infused the Prophecies&punc; which he was to preach. Lastly, what they
<PB N="185" REF="289">
in their wicked fancies had conceived, and meant to propagate, they digested into a Volume, and
called it the <HI>Alcoran.</HI></P>
<P>(13) For this too they had a trick, that it might seem to have been sent from heaven into the hands
of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and to this purpose he had himself fed up a tame Bull, which by custome became so fa|miliar,
that no sooner he heard the voice of his Master, but he would straight run, cast the head in
his lap, and use his wanton dalliance as with a fellow. Betwixt the horns of this Bull had he fastned
the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and conveyed him into a by-place, near where he had assembled the multitude at a set
time, to expect a wonderful miracle from Heaven, that might confirm his Prophecy. The sce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e thus
ordered, on the sudden he lift up his voice, and made a loud cry, which no sooner the Beast heard,
but he brake his way through the prease, overturned many of the spectators, which now stood at a
gaze, and gently laid his Horns and Book in the bosome of this false Couzener; which he with much
ceremony and feigned reverence received, and in their presence opening the Volume, began to in|terpret
the chief of their Laws, which for hereafter they were to observe.</P>
<P>(14) Circumcision he allowed, and with the old Law, forbad Swines flesh, that he might with more
ease lead on such as were <HI>Iewish;</HI> he suffered himself to be baptized by <HI>Sergius,</HI> that the Christian too
might have in some measure his content. <HI>Moses</HI> and our Saviour he denied not to be great Prophets; but
that neither party might emulate the greater observance of other; and indeed, especially that his own
might seem new, and yet take place from both, he changed the Circumcision of the <HI>Iews</HI> from the eight
day, and multiplies Baptisme, which can be conferred but once for all, upon the true believer. For
the like reason of difference with other Nations and Sects, he left both the <HI>Iews</HI> Sabbath, and
<HI>Diem Christianorum Dominicum,</HI> and commands his holy ceremonies to be celebrated on the Friday,
for so it was, when the Bull bestowed on him his <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Before they enter the Temple, they

was guilty to himself) had brought him into his epileptical fits. Briefly, what he knew would best
agree with the bruitish desires of the people, that he took order should be confirmed by his laws; four
or five wives to every husband, and as many Concubines as they would maintain. For their bliss after
life, he proposed no invisible delights which over-reacht their understanding, but proportioned to
each of their sensual thoughts, and promised to those which could keep his Law a Paradise of all
kinds of pleasure, which they themselves most affected. To the covetous, wealth; to the ambitious,
honours; to the gluttonous, meats; to the Virgins, rich attire, and embraces of Angels; the poor souls
were never so fitted: and when he had thus for a long time, discoursed over his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> he took a
yoke from <HI>Sergius,</HI> and put it upon the Bulls neck; for it was foretold by an inscription brought by
his door, that whosoever could yoak the Bull, it should be a sign to declare the man, as one sent from
God to govern his people.</P>
<P>(15) This huddle of miracles put the gazers beyond all pause, so that in an instant they cryed him
up King, and held his companion in reputation of a minor Prophet; called themselves <HI>Musulmanni,</HI>
true believers, which the <HI>Turk</HI> still affects, rather than his right name of <HI>Turk,</HI> which imports banish|ment,
and upbraids him with the disgrace of his original.</P>
<P>(16) And now he hath past the difficulty of his attempt, an easie matter to draw on millions of
followers, such as would like that Religion best which baulkt not their pleasures; yet at last he met
with an end answerable to his beginning; for he was poysoned by some of his own Family.</P>
<P>(17) He had long before prophesied, that he should be wonderfully conveyed to Heaven: and to
make good this fraud, had framed an iron chest for his Sepulchre, which he purposed should have been
<PB N="187" REF="290">
held up by force of a Load-stone, placed in the top of the Temple, and by this means have appeared
to the beholder to hang in the air without any support: But this trick (it seems) was prevented by
death; yet they expected still his ascent to Heaven, till he stank upon earth: so that at last they were
forced to convey him into his iron coffin, which remains to this day in <HI>Mecha</HI> a City of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ersia,</HI> and is
visited by the <HI>Turks,</HI> as the Sepulchre of our Saviour at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> by Pilgrim Christians.</P>
<P>(18) I took leave here to supply the room with the Customes and Religion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which in
course of our former method, was due to the division of the Empire and her several Provinces: But
I suppose, I have the less trespassed, in regard that most of them have already had their place and de|scription
in each of their particular Kingdomes, to which they did formerly belong. It will be sufficient
here to name them, with reference to the Map, where you have them delivered more at large.</P>

<HEAD>The Description of the Kingdom of CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Tract of <HI>Asia,</HI> which lies severed from <HI>Persia</HI> by the River <HI>Indus</HI> on the West, is well
known by one General name of the <HI>East-Indy;</HI> and that again is divided by the other famous Ri|ver
<HI>Ganges,</HI> into <HI>India intra Gangem,</HI> the part which looks toward <HI>Europe,</HI> and is conjectured by most
to be the land of <HI>Evilah:</HI> and <HI>India exter Gangem</HI> to the very East, some think it was that, which of
old was called <HI>Seria:</HI> both have now other names imposed by the Inhabitants; the first <HI>Indostand;</HI>
this other <HI>Tame, Tangis, Mangi,</HI> or <HI>Macys,</HI> and las<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, <HI>Sinarum regio, China.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Kingdom then is the utmost bounds East ward of the whole Continent, and therefore lies
farthest remote from Christendome; the Mistress of Arts, and example of civility to all the other
parts of the world; yet do the <HI>Chinois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> much exceed us, for ample Cities, ingenious artificers, and
multitude of Inhabitants; (which methinks) pleads fairly for her antiquity, though I give not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ull
credit to those, which settle here the sons of <HI>Iocktan,</HI> much less to their own records, which reckon
two hundred threescore and two Kings, in almost a continued succ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">on to this day; and number
from their first, above four thousand years. For to make this good, they must either vary from us in
their measure of times, as we from the <HI>Germans</HI> in length of miles; else we must commit a foul errour,
to look beyond the Floud for their original: since that time, it is not yet above three thousand n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne
hundred and twenty; and surely I think they were not exempted from the general deluge, no more
than from the sins of the whole earth.</P>
<P>(3) But if this conjecture of different account be not approved, the solecisme must rest (for me) up|on
their own ignorant vain-glory, which in their stories, transport them beyond probability; upon
hope (perhaps) that no other Nation could controul them; for in those first ages, they had li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">le
<PB N="190" REF="292">
converse, unless with men more barbarous than themselves; such as could not deliver their acts to
posterity; and therefore being left wholly to their own relations, good reason they thought they had
to do themselves what honour they might, though ignorance of the main truth makes them oft times
to trespass upon Chronology, and forge stories so unlikely, that the whole may be justly suspected.</P>
<P>(4) Their first King they name <HI>Vitei,</HI> and report him to have reigned an hundred years: his suc|cessors
went on without breach or conquest, to their two hundred forty second Prince, but were then
for a while, cut off by the <HI>Tartarians.</HI> This change was fore-told to <HI>Fairfar&punc;</HI> the last <HI>China</HI> King of the
first race; and the Prophecy laid it upon one, which should have an hundred eyes; and so had <HI>Chisan|baan</HI>
the Invader, if you will allow his name to make up the miracle; For the very word in their lan|guage
signifies no other than an hundred eyes: A poor cousenage of the Devil, but served the turn
first to dazle them with a strange Prophecy, and then to keep up the credit in the performance, with
the simple Idolaters. After nine <HI>Tartarian</HI> Princes it was again recovered to the state, in which it
now stands, by the prowess of one <HI>Gombne</HI> their 250 King&punc;</P>
<P>(5) This brief account of their beginning and progress, is more than I can warrant for undoubted
truth. The most part was past&punc; e're they were a people known to the <HI>Europaeans;</HI> for <HI>Ptolomy</HI> himself
scarce reached so far toward the East: or if it be the same with his <HI>Sinarum Regio,</HI> (which yet some
doubt) yet (it seems) he knew little more of it than the bare name; we must be content to pass over
many ages untoucht, and break abruptly, into our own times and stories, which do afford us more
certainty by the relation of later travellers, some of our own Nation.</P>
<P>(6) It is now a vast Empire, which contains in latitude almost forty degrees from the <HI>Tropick</HI> of
<HI>Cancer,</HI> to the fifty three towards the <HI>Pole Artick;</HI> and thirty in longitude from the degree one hun|dred
thirty to one hundred sixty: the bounds on the West is <HI>Industan, India intra Gangem,</HI> on the East

the South, the Kingdom of <HI>Chauchinchinae</HI> part of the other <HI>India intra Gangem.</HI></P>
<P>(17) The Air here is temperate, and the ground fruitful: the mountains and wild fields breed in|credible
numbers of Cattel, and the Woods wild Boars, Foxes&punc; Hares, Conies, and other useful beasts,
which gives us flesh for our food, and skins for our cloathing. The tilled ground returns again plenty
of Corn, Wheat, and Barley; their higher Poulse, and their lower Rice, in great abund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nce; their
Gardens pleasant, set with all sorts of Flowers, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ch may delight either the eye or scent; no clod
(almost) of earth there, but hath its wealth; for what yields not fruit, is inrich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Mines of Gold
and Silver. The chief River is <HI>Polysango,</HI> both it and the rest give fish in great abundance, and water
fowl enough almost to feed a whole Nation: <HI>Maginus</HI> reports it, that ten or twelve thousand w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ld
Ducks have been commonly spent in one day in the City <HI>Canton;</HI> besides their own profit, they ad|vantage
them much in their course of traffique, to convey their Merchandise into several parts of the
Empire, to meet with their Chapmen from all quarters. Their principal commodities are Silks and
Sugars: yet besides these, they send forth Wooll, Cotton, Olives, Metals Rhubarb, Honey, Purs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">n d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sh|es,
Camphire, Ginger, Pepper, &amp;c. Musk, Salt great store, whose Custome, in only one Town of <HI>Can|ton,</HI>
amounts to the yearly value of 18000 Crowns. To this happiness of soyl may be added the thrift
and great industry of the Inhabitants, who hold it a soul disgrace to be accounted idle: and therefore
make the most of what they have; so that without doubt, as they are infinitely populous, so they
are proportionably rich, beyond any other Nation of the world.</P>
<P>(18) The <HI>Chinoyse</HI> is described with a broad face of a dusky colour, crooked nose, small and black
eyes, and very thin beard, but long hair on the head: if any be deformed (for so they take it) with a
better feature, they are as like to break a jest upon his handsome comely visage, as a scoffer would upon
their ill-fashioned countenance. The better sort are clothed in long silk garments, the ordinary peo|ple
<PB N="192" REF="293">
in linnen, for they have not yet the Art well to weave woollen: their women deck their heads
with gold and precious Iewels, seldome shew themselves abroad without great attendance of ser|vants.</P>
<P>(9) The men in their several employments, are infinitely laborious and ingenious; it is very rare
to see any of them in a strange Country: nor will they easily admit a Stranger far into theirs, unless he
be first well tried for his honesty and good meaning toward their State; they are addicted much to
manual arts, for they have excellent practick wits; and indeed, for that go beyond any other Nations.
Much quarrel hath been about the invention of Guns and Printing, which several people have been
ambitious to take to themselves, as the master-piece of mans wit: but without doubt, they were both
used here, long before any of <HI>Europe</HI> pretended to the knowledge of either. In their writings, they
make not their lines from the right hand to the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t, as the <HI>Hebrews;</HI> nor from the left to the right as
we do; but from the top to the bottom of the Page: and use all one Character through the whole
Kingdom, though several parts differ much in their language, or at least in their idiomes. Their special
skill, which we much admire, but cannot imitate, is in making the Purslain dishes white as very snow,
and transparent as glass, formed up only of Cockles found in the Sea-shore mixt with Egg-shells; but
lie buried in the earth many years before they come to perfection, and are seldome took up by the
same artificer which kneads them, but are left as a portion to some of his posterity.</P>
<P>(10) Their fashions in private Houses are not much unlike to those of <HI>Europe:</HI> at board they sit in
chairs, and upon forms, not loll on the floor, as most of the <HI>Asiaticks</HI> do&punc; they touch not their
meat with the Hand, but use the Silver fork, or else some stick of Ivory or Ebony, not much unlike
it: they eat thrice in one day, but sparingly enough: when they travel over the plains, they use a
kind of Coach, yet not drawn with Horses or other beast, but driven by the wind under sayl, as a
Bark on the Sea, which the people are as perfect to guide which way they please, as the Mariner is to
<PB N="193" REF="293">
direct his course unto any coast, whither he is bound: as they sail upon Land, as if it were Sea, so
they dwell as frequently upon the Sea, as if it were land: for they have an incredible number of ships,
and boats, which are in many places ranked like streets upon the waters, and filled with Inhabitants,
such as are here born, live, traffique, marry, and die. Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> reports, that upon one River from
<HI>Nanquin</HI> to <HI>Paquin,</HI> they are thus ordered for 300 leagues. No marvel then, if their number exceed
any part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">roportionably of the whole earth; since their Land is not sufficient, but is forced to borrow
room out of the Sea for their Habitation: yet are they all governed by one Monarch, whom they
call the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d of the World, son to the Sun. For they are a proud Nation, and admit not equal com|parison
with any other earthlings; but cast it as a Proverb into their teeth, that they have but one
eye to see with, in respect of the <HI>Chinoys,</HI> who alone (as themselves boast) see with two: the truth is,
in matters of State, they are very politick, in peace wary, and in war valiant, crafty, and excellent
Engineers.</P>
<P>(11) Their Laws are for the most part just, and severely executed, especially against idle droans,
which set not a hand to advance their State, or maintain themselves. They will not cherish the very
blind by alms, since without eyes a man may be fit for some corporal imployment; but to the mai|med
and lame they deny not a charitable mainten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nce. The son is bound to exercise his Parents occu|pation,
so that no pretence almost is left for wanderers: and briefly, as far as humane Laws can pro|vide,
all other vain occasions, for mis-expence of time, are taken off; for within the Cities no Stews
are allowed, or lewd persons to withdraw them; adultery is punished with death, but yet they have
liberty to take many wives; one they keep at home, the rest are disposed of abroad, where they best
please. Their Marriages they chiefly solemnize at the new Moon, and for the most part in <HI>March.</HI>
which begins their year.</P>
<P>(12) For their Religion they are <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but have a confused knowledge of God, Heaven, and the
<PB N="194" REF="294">
Creation, which they ascribe to one <HI>Trine,</HI> who first (say they) made <HI>Pauson</HI> and <HI>Pausona,</HI> and their po|sterity
continued for 90000 years; but were then for their wickedness destroyed, and a new race was
created. The first of their second was one <HI>Lutitzan,</HI> who had two horns; from the right come men,
as they fondly imagine, and from the left women; when they would descipher their great god, they
express him by the first letter of their Alphabet; and in their devotions they worship him as their
chief, (but not only) preserver; for they have their prayers to the Sun, Moon Stars, and to the De|vil
himself, that he would not hurt them. Their Priests are distinguisht into the black and white Fri|ars,
as we call them; for they much resemble Friars in their course of life; some are clothed in white,
their heads shorn, and their victuals in common; others in black, long hair, and live apart: neither
are married, but both take their liberty to live obscenely, as the debauchedst swaggerers.</P>
<P>(13) The Empire is divided into 15 Provinces. <HI>(1) Canton. (2) Feguien. (3) Olam. (4) Sisnam.

Cities, in number more, in compass bigger, and in wealth more eminent than the best of ours.</P>
<P>(14) (1) In the Province of <HI>Canton</HI> are 190 Towns, and 37 Cities. (2) In <HI>Feguien,</HI> 99 Towns, and
33 Cities. (3) In <HI>Olam</HI> 130 Towns, and 90 Cities. (4) In <HI>Sisnam,</HI> 150 Towns, and 44 Cities. (5) In
<HI>Tolench</HI> 235 Towns, and 51 Cities; and this is governed immediate by the Emperour himself, with|out
any substitute, as all other Provinces have, except <HI>Pagina.</HI> (6) <HI>Causaie</HI> hath 122 Towns, 24 Ci|ties.
(7) <HI>Minchien</HI> 29 Towns, 25 Cities. (8) <HI>Ochiam</HI> 74 Towns, 19 Cities. (9) <HI>Honan,</HI> 102 Towns,
and 20 Cities. (10) <HI>Pagina,</HI> 150 Towns, and 47 Cities.</P>
<P>(13) The chief of this is <HI>Paquin,</HI> where he hath his continual residence, and scarce at any time
leaves the City, unless upon occasion of war; for it is seated near to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who oft-times
make assaults upon the <HI>Chinoyse,</HI> and force the King to gather his strength into that quarter; and he
<PB N="195" REF="294">
himself present to withstand their entry: lest if they should once get footing into any part of his Coun|trey,
they might encroach farther, and enable themselves by his spoils to follow their blow upon his
other Provinces. His Palace here is compassed with a triple wall, carries the bulk and face of a fair
Town; for indeed his retinue are no fewer than might well people a large City: among the rest he
hath 16000 <HI>Eunuchs</HI> daily attending, such as their own parents have emasculated in their infancy, to
make them capable of this Court preferment. The seat Imperial was heretofore at <HI>Nanquim,</HI> where
still remains a golden testimony of her past glory. It is a fair City thirty miles in compass, seated
nine leagues from the Sea, upon a fair and navigable a River, where there rides commonly at least 10000
of the Kings Ships, besides Merchants. It hath three brick walls, the streets are six miles in length, of
a proportionable breadth, and trimly paved.</P>
<P>(16) (11) <HI>Zaiton</HI> hath 78 Towns, and 27 Cities; the chief <HI>Zaiton,</HI> which hath a fair harbour, and is
seldome without 500 ships. (12) <HI>Quinchien</HI> hath 113 Towns, and 45 Cities. (13) <HI>Chaguean,</HI> 95
Towns, and 39 Cities. (14) <HI>Susnam,</HI> 105 Towns, and 41 Cities. (15) And lastly, <HI>Quinsey</HI> 114
Towns, Cities.</P>
<P>(17) The Metropolis is <HI>Quinsay</HI> or <HI>Suntien,</HI> the largest City of the world: for it contains 100
miles in compass: it is seated in a low and Fenny ground, is subject to Flouds, and hath been forced
in very many places to erect bridges for free passage from one street to another: there are in all
12000, built of stone, and most of them so high, that a good ship may strike under them with full
sayl: each of them hath its ten watchmen for a night guard. The inhabitants of this City live luxu|riously,
especially their women, who are much more comely than their men; yet all of them almost
eat both Horse and Dogs flesh. Towards the South part of the City there is a great lake about 24
miles in circuit; in the midst stand two Islands, whither the chief Nobility repair a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d invite their
friends to solemnize their marriage, and have in each a stately place erected, furnished sufficiently
<PB N="196" REF="295">
with all fitting ornaments for a wedding jollity. In many parts of the City there are publick places
of receit for such as sustain any misfortune by fire; there they may lodge their goods safe upon a
sudden casualty till they can make better provision.</P>
<P>(18) It were vain to give a more particular Description of the many Cities which make up the seve|ral
numbers in each Province: they stand so thick, and are so populous, that they all seem to be as
one; one, as well for their continued building almost, as their fashion of building; for they all ob|serve
the same form, and dispose their streets alike; two broad, cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ing each other in the middle in
so strait a line, that the eye may reach clean from one end to the other.</P>
<P>(19) We may conclude, that both the Revenues of the whole Empire, and number of Inhabitants,
are not easily to be reckoned: yet this in brief, he hath subject under him 70 crowned Kings, gathers
up yearly 120 millions of Crowns, stirs not into the field without 300000 Foot, and 200000 Horse.
To this Empire did once belong most of the Islands in the Eastern Seas, but it seems the <HI>Chinoyse</HI> in
time found, that their defence was a business of more charge than their worth countervailed: and
therefore let them even slip into their own hands, and bounded their government with the Sea-coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t;
yet for such as lye in the same Latitude, from the <HI>Tropick</HI> toward the Pole, they may most properly be
named at least in this description; and but named; since they were before set forth in our general
Map of <HI>Asia.</HI> The chief are <HI>Lequio minor, Reix Magos, Lequio major, Mazacar, Iapan,</HI> a very large

the rule of valour; distinguisht not right from wrong in their quarrels, but reckoned justly their
own, whatever they could clasp by force of Arms. And this they all practised almost without diffe|rence
of sex, unless in this, that their women were most warlike: witness that incomparable story of

<P>(5) These had their time. The <HI>Gothes</HI> or <HI>Getae</HI> succeeded, and were inheritors as well of their

some knowledge of the the true God, at least some precepts of civility from their Fore-fathers, though

with the truth, and yet afterward fallen into that gross barbarism, which is now found among the
<HI>Tartarians?</HI> See their Character, which (as they are by most described) deals impartially; gives them
ill-fashioned bodies, answerable to their rude minds, fit Houses for so unclean Guests.</P>
<P>(7) There stature is different. The most part have large shoulders, a broad face, with a crooked
nose, deformed countenance, swarthy colour, hollow eyes, hairy and untrimmed beard, and head close
shaved. Their speech is boysterous and clamourous; their noise in singing like the yell of Wolves;
and endurance of Hunger, Thirst, Heat, Cold, and Watching, equals them (in strength of body) to
the most able beast, for it exceeds the common power of a man. Their lust is without law. For they
except no kindred but their own Mothers, Daughters, and Sisters: No species, for they mix with
Beasts: no sex, for they are insatiate <HI>Sodomites:</HI> and yet take liberty for as many wives as they can
maintain; which contrary to our civil courses they buy of their Parents, instead of receiving dow|ries.
Their meat is the raw flesh of Horses, without regard how they were killed, or of what diseases
they died: sometimes they suck bloud from the living, to appease their Hunger and Thirst, if (in a
journey) they be distressed for want of food.</P>
<P>(8) Cities they have but few, nor Houses, other than moveable Tents, made of Beasts skins, which
they pitch up by great multitudes, in the form of a Town, and those are called Hordes; when the grass
is once eaten bare, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d the ground yields not meat for their Cattel, they trudge with bag and bag|gage

Horseback, for their more speedy flight; and have them commonly strongly poysoned, for the more
sure mischief to the Foe. Their Stratagems are down right fraud, and breach of truth; for they keep
no Faith with any enemy, regard not any compact made upon terms of peace; but follow their own
sense, and commit what outrages they can with least danger to themselves.</P>
<P>(9) Their Religion is answerable to their vile customs; Some are <HI>Pagans,</HI> others <HI>Mahometans,</HI> yet
will not be called <HI>Turks,</HI> but <HI>Bersemanni,</HI> and their chief Priest <HI>Seyd,</HI> whom they reverence more than
their Maker, and admit that none should touch his Hand, but their Kings, and these too with an hum|ble
gesture: their Dukes aspire not above his knee, nor their Nobles higher than his feet: the rest
are happy, if they can but reach at his garment, his horse, his any thing, so simple are they in their
Superstition: and thus have they continued either Atheists or false Idolaters, ever since their first
entrance upon this Kingdome in the year 1187. Before, they were not esteemed a Nation at all, but
wild people, without law or reason almost, who lived in the open fields, and conversed with no o|ther

<P>(10) Their first King was one <HI>Chinchis,</HI> a man of low birth, but high spirit, impatient of that sla|vish
condition to which he was bred; he brake forth at last, and drew more by his example, into the

not only setled himself in the throne, but enlarged the dominion of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> through a great part

the said Corporation or Company of Adventurers of <HI>Virginia</HI> held any interest there which was

well-set, of a tawny complexion, with black, flaggy, and long hair, crafty, and treache|rous,
sufficiently laborious in the art of War, which they used frequently to exercise among
each other; and wonderful lovers of hunting, in other things most scandalously lazy and in|dulgent

<HEAD>The Description of Mary-Land.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was in the year 1631 that his late Majesty gave a grant to <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> for
the possessing and planting the Southern part of <HI>New-Netherland,</HI> now <HI>New-York|shire,</HI>
lying toward <HI>Virginia;</HI> when upon his Embassy to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> they
declared by publick writing their dissent to what-ever had been acted by any of their
subjects in prejudice of his Majesties Right and Title in those parts, as hath been
already mentioned. <HI>Crescentia</HI> was the name first in designation for this Countrey; but it being
left to his Majesty at the time of his signing of the Bill, to give it what denomination he judged
fittest; he was pleased in honour of his Royal Consort Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> to erect it into a Province
by the name of <HI>Mary-Land:</HI> which Patent, upon the death of his Lordship, before the final
ratification thereof, was not long after confirmed under the Broad-Seal of <HI>England,</HI> bearing date
<HI>Iune 20, Ann.</HI> 1632, to his Son and Heir <HI>Coecilius</HI> the now Lord <HI>Baltimore;</HI> investing him, his
heirs and successors with the Sovereignty, attended with all Royal Prerogatives both Military and
Civil, as absolute Lords and Proprietors of the said Province, saving only the Allegiance and

as of his Majesties honour of <HI>Windsor;</HI> for the yearly payment at the Castle of the said honour
of <HI>Windsor</HI> on every <HI>Easter Tuesday,</HI> of two <HI>Indian</HI> Arrows of those parts; and the fifth part of
all the Gold and Silver Oar which should happen to be found there.</P>
<P>The next year after this Patent had past, <HI>viz.</HI> in the year 1633, a Colony of about 200 in all,
Servants and Planters, (whereof some persons of quality) was sent over by the Lord Proprietor,

under the Conduct of his Lordships two Brothers, Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> and Mr. <HI>George Calvert:</HI> the first

Plantation hath prospered, and by the several supplies since sent, very much increased; to which
good success, the good Government of the said Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> and his strict observance of his
Lordship's prudent instructions, very much conduced. The first place they pitch'd upon to

so much the more easie rate, in regard of their pre-intentions to leave this place, as thinking
it their safest course to remove farther off from their too potent and valiant Neighbours the <HI>Ses|quehanocks.</HI></P>

charge he hath continued ever since in great tranquility and prosperity, and with general con|tentment
and satisfaction by his obliging carriage to all that live under his Government, or have
any interests or concerns in the Province.</P>
<P>This Province, according as it is bounded and set out by the forementioned Patent, extends
one way from the most Northernly part which bounds it to the South, and from which it is parted
by the Southernly bank of the River <HI>Patowmeck</HI> to <HI>New-York,</HI> or the most Southernly part of

to the true Meridian of the first Fountain of the River <HI>Patowmeck</HI> Westward.</P>
<P>The Climate here in Summer time inclines to an extraordinary heat, and in Winter is very
cold; but both the heat of the Summer is very much allayed by cool Breeses, and the cold of
<PB N="215" REF="304">
the Winter is of short continuance; so that the Country is accounted sufficiently healthful,
and of late agrees well enough with English bodies, since the abatement and almost extinction,
through the regulation of diet, felling of the woods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that distemper called the <HI>Sea|soning,</HI>
which used to be very fatal to the English at their first landing.</P>
<P>This Countrey is for the most part champain, the Soil fruitful and abounding with many sorts
of fruits and other commodities which are common in our parts of the World; and for those
that are peculiar, it cannot be imagined that in so small a distance, and even in the same Coun|try

there is a sort of fruit called a <HI>Persimon</HI> mentioned as most especially belonging to <HI>Mary-Land:</HI>

<HEAD>The Description of New-England.</HEAD>
<P>_WHat hath been said in General of the discovery of <HI>Virginia,</HI> largely so called, may
in consequence be applyed to this Country of <HI>New-England;</HI> being as above men|tioned,
one of the three principal Colonies comprehended therein: but in the year
1602, it began to be more particularly known a part from the rest, from the dis|covery
as some think, of Captain <HI>Gosnold;</HI> and in the year 1606, it was granted
by Patent by King <HI>Iames,</HI> to divers Lords and Gentlemen under the denomination of the <HI>Ply|mouth</HI>
Company; yet after that several that set out for this Plantation successively, either miscar|ried
or returned <HI>re infecta,</HI> as first Captain <HI>Henry Chaloung,</HI> who meeting with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet
that came from the <HI>Havana</HI> was with all his Company carried Prisoner into <HI>Spain:</HI> Not long
after, <HI>Thomas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Haman</HI> sent to the succour of <HI>Chaloung</HI> by Sr. <HI>Iohn Popham</HI> Lord cheif Iustice of
<HI>England.</HI> Next Captain <HI>Prinne</HI> set out by the <HI>Bristol</HI> Company, whose Voyage, though it had
not its wisht success, yet he returned with a farther discovery of the Coast than had been made
before. Not long after <HI>George Popham</HI> and <HI>Raleigh Gilbert,</HI> were fitted out at the
charge of Sir <HI>Iohn Popham,</HI> with one hundred men, who though they had seated themselves
not uncommodiously in a <HI>Peninsula</HI> at the mouth of the River <HI>Sagadahoc,</HI> and were upon mak|ing
farther discoveries; yet in the year 1608, upon the death of <HI>George Popham</HI> their Com|mander,
and soon after of the Lord Chief Iustice, they returned into <HI>England,</HI> notwithstand|ing
supplies had but lately been sent them, to the very great distaste of the chief promoters of
the design; and whereupon the <HI>French</HI> had taken occasion to plant themselves in these parts, had
they not been timely expelled by Sr. <HI>Samuel Argal</HI> from <HI>Virginia.</HI> The next that attempted a
<PB N="219" REF="306">
settlement here, was Captain <HI>Hobson,</HI> who by reason of the opposition raised against him by
two Natives, whom having been detained some while in <HI>England</HI> he took back along with him,
upon an affront offered them by some of the <HI>English,</HI> was forc't to return without effecting of
any thing, notwithstanding which insuccess, he ventured again, having under his command
several Land Soldiers in the company of Captain <HI>Harly,</HI> who was fitted out by Sr. <HI>Ferdinando
Gorges</HI> then Governour of <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Afterwards in the year 1615, there went Sr. <HI>Richard
Hawkins,</HI> then Captain <HI>Rocroft;</HI> after him Captain <HI>Dormer:</HI> And in the year 1623, Captain
<HI>Robert Gorges.</HI> By all which Voyages, however though this Plantation was not brought to any
settlement, by reason of the many misfortunes and disappointments that attended them; yet
so many of them as were made, and following so thick upon the neck of each other, could not
but add much light to the discoveries that were first produced, and at least make way for fu|ture
improvements: but that which chiefly conduced to the full peopling, and that flourish|ing
estate which this Colony at present injoys, was that general aversion at that time grown to
a great height, against the Church Government of this Nation, which caused multitudes of peo|ple
greedily to take hold on this occasion, that they might betake themselves to a place where
they might securely indulge to that liberty of Conscience they so much desired, and for which
many of them had fled before into <HI>Holland,</HI> especially when at length upon consideration of
the little loss, but rather benefit, the absence of persons so disaffected and unconformable
would be to the Kingdom, and of the advantage that would accrue to the Colony from the sup|plement
of so great a number of people, free liberty was granted for their transportation. So
that in the year 1630, there landed of them a very considerable number at <HI>Plymouth</HI> Plantation,
and that without any opposition from any of the Natives, one great reason whereof might pro|bably
be the great Mortality that hapned at that time among the <HI>Narragansetts, Niantics, Taran|tines,
<PB N="220" REF="307">
Wippanaps, Peoods,</HI> those of <HI>Agissawang, Pockaneki,</HI> and <HI>Abargini,</HI> and other chief Tribes
of the <HI>Indians</HI> of these parts. From this time forward, what with the industry of the people,
and the continual supplies that were sent from time to time for some years, they soon increased
to a great height, and are become at present one of the most powerful and thriving of the <HI>English</HI>
Plantations in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>At the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r first arrival they divided themselves into four sub-Colonies, the <HI>Massachusets, Plymouth,
Canectico,</HI> and <HI>New-haven,</HI> which commonly met toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">her in Counsel upon all important occa|sions,
either of Peace or War: As some little Wars they had at first, chiefly with the <HI>Pequods,</HI>
whom nevertheless they quickly subdued, having first concluded a Peace with <HI>Cannonicus</HI> the su|pream
<HI>Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Narragansits.</HI></P>
<P>This County lying in the midst of the temperate Zone between the 41 and 45 degrees of
Northern Latitude, and aequidistant between the Artic circle and Tropic of <HI>Cancer</HI> in the same
Parellel with <HI>France,</HI> and some part of <HI>Italy;</HI> is bounded to the North-East with <HI>Norumbigua,</HI> to
the South-West with <HI>Novum Belgium</HI> or <HI>New-Netherlands</HI> now <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>The temperature of the Air, and fertility of the Soil differs not remarkably, as may well be
imagined, from the rest of the <HI>Virginian</HI> tract; and consequently affords the like plenty and
variety of all sorts of Commodittes, yet there are reckoned as chiefly appropriated to this
part of the Country divers kinds of Plants, and Trees, among which the <HI>Cedar,</HI> the <HI>Sprewse,
sassafras,</HI> and Dyers <HI>Sumach,</HI> and also some peculiar Beasts, Birds, and Fishes.</P>
<P>Of Beasts, the <HI>Musquash</HI> less than a Beaver, but much resembling it in shape, the Musky Scent
whereof proceeds from the stones of the male, and whose skins in regard of their sweet Scent, are
brought over as rich Presents. The <HI>Moose</HI> as big an Ox, slow of foot, yet in shape somewhat
like a red Dear, and headed like a Buck, yielding flesh good for meat, hides for cloathing:
<PB N="221" REF="307">
This Beast in regard of its fruitfulness (for the female brings forth three at a time) and its har|diness;
for it will live in winter without fodder, may be with good advantage kept tame, and
accustomed to the Yoke. The <HI>Rackoon,</HI> tailed like a Fox, otherwise like a Badger, but with a
deep furr: This beast sleeps by day in a hollow tree; in moonshiny nights at low tide it feeds
on Clams by the Sea-side.</P>
<P>Of Birds, the <HI>Loon,</HI> a most ill-favoured bird not much unlike the <HI>Cormorant,</HI> and very un|weildy,
for it cannot fly, and scarce go; it makes a noise like a Sow-gelders horn. The <HI>Humi|lity</HI>
or rather <HI>Simplicity,</HI> in regard it so simply exposeth it self to the shot of the fowler, the
bigger sort is about the bigness of a green Plover, the other no bigger than that sort of bird we
call here a Knot: but the <HI>Humbird</HI> is no less curious and remarkable than any other bird whatso|ever,
whether in <HI>New-England</HI> or any other part of the World, if we consider the rarity of its
bulk, it being no bigger then a Horne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, yet having the perfect shape and proportion of a bird;
it seems to take its name from the humming noise it makes.</P>
<P>Of Fishes the most peculiar are the <HI>Seal</HI> or Sea-calf, chiefly prised for its Skin, next for its
Oyl, of which it yields a large quantity, the chief use whereof is to burn in lamps; for its flesh
wholly useless, as not fit to be eaten. The <HI>Shark</HI> sometimes as big as a horse, having three
rows of teeth with which they have many times snapt off the hands and feet of men as they
swam: With the flesh of this fish (being good for nothing else) they oft manure Land. The <HI>Holli|but,</HI>
a fish in shape somewhat resembling a <HI>Pleace,</HI> but of a far larger size, that is to say, two yards
long, one wide, and a foot thick, the best of this for the table is accounted the head and fins,
especially baked or stew'd. The <HI>Basse,</HI> a fish of all others in these parts accounted the greatest
delicacy to eat, exceeding Ling or Haberdine, when salted up for winter, as usually the bodies
of them are, the heads being eaten fresh; the common size is two or three foot long. The
<PB N="222" REF="308">
<HI>Clam</HI> or <HI>Clamp,</HI> a shell-fish, having some resemblance of a Cockle, with a round hole by which
it takes in and spouts out water continually, the biggest of them which are as big as a large
apple, are among the Natives a great dainty, and by the <HI>English</HI> not altogether despised. The
<HI>Alewife,</HI> a sort of fish most like a Herring, coming up once a year, namely in <HI>April,</HI> in vast
shoales into Rivers and fresh waters to spawn, from whence till they have spawned, not the
most violent disturbance that can be devised, can force them to return.</P>
<P>Of Noxious Creatures the chief is the Rattle Snake, being generally a yard and a half long,
thick in the middle, yellow bellied, spotted on the back with various colours, its thin neck
stretching into a wide swallow, wide mouthed, with teeth as sharp as needles, wherewith such
as are bitten cannot be cured, but by chawing the root of snake-weed, and applying the chaw|ed
root to the wound: which root chawed by any that are not thus bitten, is of it self poyson.
Of Insects the most peculiar and principal are the <HI>Wild Bee,</HI> as they call it, which building ha|bitacles
like Cobwebs among the Vine leaves, guards the Grapes. The <HI>Gurnipper,</HI> which no big|ger
than a flea, bites also like a flea, though somewhat more rancorously, and lives but three
weeks. The <HI>Musqueto,</HI> which lives chiefly in thick woods or swamps, scarcely induring wind,
or excess of cold or heat, but in thick close weather, and against rain it raiseth where it bites
a venomous kind of itching.</P>
<P>The ancient Inhabitants of this part of the Country were formerly divided into several Tribes
or petty Nations, the chief whereof were East and North-East the <HI>Churchers</HI> and <HI>Tarentines:</HI>
Southward the <HI>Pequods</HI> and <HI>Naragansetts:</HI> Westward the <HI>Canectacuts</HI> and <HI>Mawhacks:</HI> North-West,
the <HI>Aberginians;</HI> all which people how different from each other in nature and disposition
in so small a compass of ground, is wonderfull to imagine; the <HI>Mawhacks</HI> most bloudy, savage,
and man-eaters: The <HI>Tarentines</HI> little less cruel, but not Canibals: The <HI>Aberginians</HI> more mild,

innocent, and harmless, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in religious Ceremonies, Habit, Civil manner of Govern|ment,
Marriages, Burials, Ingenuity in Arts and Manufactures, Games and Exercises, not ma|terially
differing. Among the rest, which it would be too tedious here to insist upon; it is ob|servable
that the figures of Beasts and other things described upon their bodies, are not de|scribed
by superficial painting, but by incision and impunction of colours between the skin and
the flesh.</P>
<P>What Provinces this Country was anciently divided into, I find not otherwise than acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ding
to the several Tribes or people already mentioned: Only there is peculiar mention made
of the Province of <HI>Laconia,</HI> now inalrged into a greater, called the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> and much
about the same, either more or less with the Country of the <HI>Troquois</HI> anciently so called. The
name of <HI>Laconia</HI> seems derived from those Lakes, which are the most noted, if not only ones
of <HI>New-England,</HI> but since is one grand one named the Lake of <HI>Trequois</HI> made by the River <HI>Saga|dahoc,</HI>
and said to contain 60 Leagues in length, and 40 in breadth, in which Connent there
are about four or five pretty large Islands.</P>
<P>The Rivers of this Country are <HI>Tamescot, Agomentico, Nansic, Conecticut, Sagadahoc, Apana|wapesk,

<HEAD>The Description of New-Neatherlands, now called
New-York.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NOvum Belgium,</HI> or <HI>New-Netherland,</HI> now called <HI>New-York,</HI> was first discovered by
<HI>Henry Hudson, Aun:</HI> 1609, at the charge of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; but in regard
he return'd without leaving any men upon the place; the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the year 1614,
under <HI>Adrian Block</HI> and <HI>Godyn</HI> began to plant themselves there; and doubtless had
soon setled themselves, (upon a double pretence; first, as finding the place not
pre-possest, and therefore free for any that would enter: next, as having contracted with <HI>Had|son</HI>
for his interest, and bought all his Charts and Instruments) had not Sir <HI>Samuel Argal,</HI> then
Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> disputed the business with them. And upon a serious debate and con|ference
with them about it, wherein he alledged that <HI>Hudson</HI> being a Subject of the King of
<HI>England,</HI> and acting solely by his commission, had not power to alienate any Countrey he dis|covered
for the King his Master, without his Majesties consent; but that this Countrey more
especially belonged to him as his own Dominion, being accounted part of the Province of <HI>Vir|ginia:</HI>
he brought them to acknowledge the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Title, and to submit to the hold|ing
of the Countrey as feodatory of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and under the Government of <HI>Vir|ginia.</HI>
Yet this compliance was not of a very long continuance; for upon the expectation of a
new Governor they fell back into their first principles, and made no scruple to usurp the whole
Soveraignty; and to denominate it their own, called it by the name of <HI>Novum Belgium,</HI> or the
<PB N="228" REF="311">
<HI>New Neatherlands:</HI> and moreover they fell to building of Towns and Forts; the Town they
erected they called <HI>New Amsterdam;</HI> their first Fort <HI>Fort-Orange;</HI> after which they raised an|other
by the name of <HI>Fort-Ams<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">el.</HI> However, these proceedings upon complaints made to his
late Majesty, and by him represented to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> were absolutely disowned by
them, and wholly laid upon the <HI>East-India</HI> Company of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> upon which the most Nor|thernly
part toward <HI>New-England,</HI> was by his Majesty granted by Patent to Sir <HI>Edmund Loiden,</HI>
by the name of <HI>Nova Albion;</HI> the most Southernly toward <HI>Virginia,</HI> to Sir <HI>George Calvert,</HI> now
Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> by the name of <HI>Mary-Land;</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon some consideration agreed on,
were forthwith to have quitted the place: yet for all this, as the custom of this people is, never
to let go any opportunity that serves their turn, whether by right or wrong, taking advantage
of the unhappy dissentions and civil wars that soon after hapned in this Nation, they not only
stood upon higher demands than were at first agreed on, but also endeavoured to stir up the
Natives against the <HI>English,</HI> that they might have the better opportunity to fix themselves. In
this state things remained till his present Majesty, after his restauration, resolving to make a full
determination of his right to these parts, sent three Men of War, by whom <HI>New Amsterdam</HI>
being easily reduc'd, the Countrey came thenceforth into the sole possession of the <HI>English,</HI>
and was immediately, together with <HI>Long Island,</HI> conferr'd by his Majesty upon the Duke of

and promotion it hath been of late advanc'd to a very populous, well regulated, and thriving

<P>The temperature of the Climate, fertility of the Soil, and productions of the Earth, differ
not materially from <HI>New England,</HI> and other adjacent parts.</P>
<P>The principal Rivers are three, <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, formerly nam'd <HI>Manhattes,</HI> by the <HI>Dutch,

<P>The only noted Town of <HI>New York-shire</HI> was built by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by the title of <HI>New Amsterdam,</HI>
though now wholly changed into that of <HI>New-York,</HI> in the neck of the Island of <HI>Manhatans;</HI>
with very fair Streets, and well-built Houses. For the security of this Town, on one side there|of
is a Fort, which was at first term'd <HI>Fort-Amscel,</HI> now <HI>Iames Fort.</HI> This Town is govern'd
by a Mayor, Aldermen, a Sheriff and Iustices of the Peace.</P>
<P>The nature and complexion of the native Inhabitants differ not much from those of the <HI>Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ridans:</HI>
but their customs, habits, and ceremonies in Religion are not altogether the same. They
observe no set-meals, but eat as oft as their appetite serves: their <HI>Sappaen,</HI> which is <HI>Indian</HI>
Wheat stampt and boyled to pap, is a great dish with them. Men turn away their Wives upon
the least occasion imaginable, and marry again; nor scruples any one to marry a woman that
hath been lain w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e, when a single woman. Both men and women wear a girdle of
<PB N="230" REF="312">
Whale-sins, and Sea-shells, the men putting half an ell of cloath three quarters broad between
their legs, so as that a square piece hangs before over his belly, another below behind his back. The
women wear a coat that reaches half way down their legs, curiously wrought with Sea-shells; and
for an upper garment they have a large Dear-skin, the lappets whereof hang full of points, button'd
on the right shoulder, and tied about the middle. The men go bare-headed; the women tying
their hair behind in a tuft, wear over it a square-cap, wrought with Sea-shells; of which they also
wear chains and bracelets about their middle, neck and arms: the men paint their faces with seve|ral
colours; the women use only here and there a black spot: their usual painting colours are either
the Iuices prest out of several Plants, or the fine ground powders of certain curious coloured
Stones: the chief of these plants hath a great resemblance to a myrtle, especially in its leaves: out
of the red berry of this plant a juice is squeezed, and dried in the Sun, and preserved for ordi|nary
use in bags; when they have occasion to use it, they temper it with water, producing the
richest purple colour that can be imagined: they use pleated hair, which being coloured red,
hath a fine gloss, in stead of feathers.</P>
<P>It is observable in their religious worship that in the midst of their sorceries and diabolical ce|remonies,
the Devil, whom alone they worship, as the regent of mischief, and sitting president in
every bodily pain, and therefore most proper to be sought and oblig'd, is said to appear in the
shape of a wild or tame beast, informing them obscurely of things to come; and portending, if the
first, bad; if the last, good fortune. Yet they acknowledge a God, who living in profound bliss, not
troubling himself with humane affairs, solaceth himself with a Goddess of most surpassing beauty,
and the Mother of all terrestrial creatures. Moreover, they believe that the souls of those that
have lived well here, are translated after their decease to some Southern Clime, where they live
in utmost pleasure and delight: whereas the souls of the wicked are hurried up and down in a
miserable vagrancy.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="312">Remarkable also is the manner of their proceeding against Criminals condemned to death;
which is, to hunt them like wild beasts into the woods; whither, in stead of being committed to
Prison, they are forced, or rather suffered to fly; as soon as he is discovered, the King having
first shot, if he miss, the rest follow; and happy is he who hath the fortune to give the Malefactor
his deaths-shot, for he is sure to be made a Captain, or some eminent Commander in the Wars.</P>
<P>Not to mention the several beasts, birds, and other animals that are common to this Countrey,
with the <HI>European</HI> Countreys in general, or with other parts of <HI>America;</HI> there is seen on the bor|ders
of <HI>New-York</HI> towards <HI>Canada,</HI> a sort of beast, which in its cloven feet and shaggy main re|sembles
an Horse, in its neck a Dear, in its tail a wild-Hog, having black eyes, and an horn in
the midst of the forehead. Of this animal the males never keep company with the females, ex|cept
at time of copulation. Toward the South are many <HI>Buffalo's,</HI> a beast in shape between an
Horse and a Stag; like the last of which it hath branchy horns; also a skin for thickness not
easily penetrable: the tail is short, the hair varying colour each succeeding season, the lips hang|ing,
the teeth small: this beast, though strong, is subject to the Falling-sickness, and dies of a
small wound. When hunted by the dogs, it defends it self by vomiting out an hot scalding li|quor
upon them.</P>
<P>The chief Trade of this Countrey at present consists of Corn and Cattel; though great plenty
of Flax is also sowed, at least sufficient for so much wearing cloath as serves for the use of the In|habitants
themselves, who live in very happy plenty and quiet, and very good amity and cor|respondence with the <HI>Indians,</HI> especially ever since the arrival of Collonel <HI>Nichols;</HI> who about
eight years since, upon the Patent granted of this Countrey, by his Majesty, to his Highness the
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> was sent over his Highness's Deputy Governor.</P>

whom the <HI>Antilles</HI> are accounted the same with the <HI>Caribes.</HI> But setting aside that
dispute, this is agreed on; that it was one of the first discovered places of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
by <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> under whose conduct the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first planted them|selves
in the North-west part of the Isle, and built <HI>Melila,</HI> but soon removed to <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">istana,</HI> and
from thence afterwards to another more healthful place, where they built a fair City, by the
name of <HI>St. Iago de la Vega;</HI> and here they setled till the year 1655. In which the <HI>English</HI> fail|ing
of that grand exploit in which they were employed by <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> for the taking of
<HI>St. Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> made their retreat hither; and though but the remnants of a broken
Army, were yet strong enough to force their entrance. Nor was this the first time; for in the
year 1596, the <HI>English,</HI> under Sir <HI>Anthony Shirly,</HI> took the <HI>Island,</HI> putting the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to flight:
though either not able, or not thinking it worth the while to keep it, they soon quitted the
place. But this second seizure hath taken faster hold; insomuch, that what with the natural fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|tility

the absolute Lordship and Proprietorship which the Dukes of <HI>Veragua Columbus</HI> the descendants
of <HI>Christopher</HI> had over <HI>Iamaica;</HI> had so slenderly peopled it, that no wonder they were so easily
dispossest as they were: for though at first flying to the mountains they stood upon terms of
treaty, depending upon effectual Succours to be sent them: yet those Succours not coming
equal to expectation, and those that came from <HI>Cuba</HI> and other parts, 500 at one time, and 30

forced at last to quit the <HI>Island,</HI> and leave the <HI>English</HI> absolute Masters thereof. And it is but just
they should be for ever ejected out of a Possession which they had gained with so much cruelty:
for it is received for a general truth, that at their first arrival here, and in <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">to-Rico,</HI> no less than
60000 of the native Inhabitants were in a few years destroyed by their inhumane tyranny;
whereby such an universal aversion was conceived against them, that women oft-times chose ra|ther
to strangle children in the birth, than bring them forth to that servitude and misery they
were like to undergo under such a tyrannical Nation.</P>
<P>This Island of <HI>Iamaica</HI> being in form very near oval; in length from East to West above

possest by the <HI>English,</HI> if not all the <HI>Caribes</HI> in general: first discovered by <HI>Chri|stopher
Columbus.</HI> The first Colony planted in this Island was in the year 1627, and
that by the <HI>English,</HI> who have all along kept continual and undisturb'd possession.</P>
<P>This Island being of an oval form, about eight leagues in length&punc; and five in bredth, is seated
in the latitude of 13 degrees, and 20 seconds; on the North-east of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> very strong both
by Nature and Art, as being guarded with Rocks and Shoals, and a well-grown wood, which in|virons

three <HI>Forts,</HI> and a standing <HI>Militia,</HI> consisting of two Regiments of Horse, and five of Foot, well
disciplin'd, and ready at a short warning.</P>
<P>The weather here is so hot for eight months, that it would be very intollerable to travellers,
but for the cool breezes which rising and mounting with the Sun, blow generally from the North-east
and by East, except in the time of the <HI>Tornado,</HI> when for a few hours they change into
the South. Yet notwithstanding this great heat of the Air, it is also so moist, that all iron-tools,
without continual use, are wonderfully apt to contract rust. This heat and moisture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he Air,
besides the natural fertility of the Soil, causeth here no less increase than delight; insomuch
<PB N="241" REF="317">
that the fields and woods are continually green, and bring forth their Crops all the year long.
However, the two most proper times of the year for planting, are <HI>May</HI> and <HI>November.</HI> The Sun
riseth and sets here at six all the year long, and makes the days and nights of an equal length, ex|cept
in <HI>October,</HI> and then the difference is but small. The principal productions of this Island
are <HI>Logwood, Fustick, Indico, Cotton, Ginger,</HI> and <HI>Sugars;</HI> with which four last Commodities it drives
a very vast Trade, and supplies not only <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> but also several of his Majesties
other Dominions in <HI>America.</HI> The Sugar-canes are planted all the year lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g, and yield better
Sugar, when refin'd, (though not altogether so white) than that of <HI>Brasile.</HI> Nor is there wanting
here store of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> in which also a considerable Trade is driven. The chief Fruits, besides
what are familiar here with us, are <HI>Pomegranats, Citrons, Dates, Oranges; Limes, Macows, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">niper-apples,

<P><PB N="242" REF="318">As small as this Island is, it is said to have been divided in former times into several petty

have been chiefly in Caves, of which there are several in this Island, both very deep, and large

<P>The whole Island is so taken up in Plantations, that there are no more vacancies of building
than what the ground imployed requires, is divided into eleven Precincts or Parishes, containing

having several fair Streets of handsome well-built Houses, though seated in a place somewhat low
and moorish, and by consequence unhealthful, namely in the bottom of <HI>Caerlisle-Bay,</HI> in the Sou|thern

good Trade, fortified with a large Platform, and Brestworks, and affording a safe Harbour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ot
Ships: here are kept the monthly Courts for this Precinct. 4, <HI>Charles Town,</HI> seated on <HI>Oyster-Bay,</HI>

Black-Rock, Balises-Bay, Long-Bay, Clarkes-Bay,</HI> and <HI>Constance-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>The water which supplies this place is chiefly in Pools and Ponds, besides Wells and Cisterns
belonging to most houses for the rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t of rain-water: but of Rivers there are only reckoned
two, if the first be not rather to be accounted a Lake, since it runs but a very little way into the
Land: the other they call the River <HI>Tuigh,</HI> on the surface of whose waters there swims an Oil,
which being gathered thence, is usually burnt in Lamps.</P>
<P>The Estate of a Master Planter here consists chiefly in servants and <HI>Negro</HI>-slaves; and of
these three Classes or Orders the whole Islands consists: the Masters live not only in all manner
of plenty and delight: for besides Beef, Mutton, Pork, Kid, Pease, Beans, and excellent Roots,
they have all variety of Fish and Fowl, and plenty of Wine, Strong-waters, and English Beer
and Ale; but also in full stretching ease, having their Overseers to manage their business for
them, who calls the Servants and Slaves to their work, by ringing of a Bell at six a clock in the
morning, and one after dinner, and dismisses them at eleven at noon, and six at night, orders
them their several tasks, and corrects them for all misorders and neglect of their duties. The
Servants have this advantage of the Slaves, that their servitude lasts but for five years; which
<PB N="244" REF="319">
time being expir'd, they either acquire Plantations of their own, or have good allowances for
working under the chief Planters. The <HI>Negroes</HI> on the other side, who are bought like beasts in
a Fair, are kept in perpetual bondage, they and their children; and therefore though the Chri|stian
Servants are also bought, yet double the price is given for the <HI>Negroes, viz.</HI> twenty pound
a piece for the men, fifteen for the women. The diet, clothing and lodging is very hard both
for servants and slaves; but the servants have a double allowance of clothes, and their accom|modation
of lodging much better: Sunday, which is allowed as a day of respit from the Masters
labour, the most ingenious spend in some kind of manufacture for their own benefit; others
in wrestling, dancing, and such like recreations.</P>
<P>For the better administration of Government, and putting in execution the Laws of this Coun|trey,
which, if not the same, have a very near correspondence with ours in <HI>England,</HI> excepting
some that are peculiar to the place. The Island is divided into four circuits, in each of which
there is a Court of Iudicature for civil Causes, from whence appeals may be made to the Supreme
Court, which Supreme Court is in the nature of our Parliament, both as having a Legislative
Power, and consisting of three Estates, namely, the Governor or his Deputy, ten of his Counsel,
which are in stead of our House of Peers; and the Burgesses elected by the Free-men, two out
of each Parish. For the execution of Iustice here are held five Sessions yearly.</P>

<P><PB N="249" REF="321">This Countrey of <HI>Florida</HI> is well watered with many large and convenient Rivers; of which

<P>The principal Towns of <HI>Florida,</HI> whereof some built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (and one by the <HI>French</HI>)
others by the ancient Inhabitants, are, 1, St. <HI>Helens,</HI> situate on or near a Promontory or point
so called, on the utmost Frontier of the Country toward <HI>Virginia. 2, Arx Carolina,</HI> or <HI>Fort Charles,</HI>
built by <HI>Laudonier</HI> on the banks of the River <HI>Majo,</HI> and by him so called, in honour of King
<HI>Charles</HI> the 9th. of <HI>France,</HI> in whose time the Conquest of <HI>Florida</HI> was undertaken by the <HI>French:</HI>
but this place was not long after taken from them by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and very much ruinated.
3, <HI>Port Royal,</HI> a place inhabited for the sake of the Haven only, which for the commodiousness
of it, is very much frequented. 4, St. <HI>Matthews,</HI> one of the principal sortifications of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
lying on the Eastern Coast of <HI>Tergesta</HI> of <HI>Florida,</HI> properly so called. 5, St. <HI>Augustines,</HI>
another of their ancient sortified places on the same Shore, only somewhat more Southernly:
This Town, as above mentioned, was in the year 1585 taken and sack'd by Sir <HI>Francis Drake.</HI>
6, <HI>Vitacuche,</HI> once the chief Seat of the Province or petty Kingdom of <HI>Vitacuche;</HI> though n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

Village of <HI>Acuera,</HI> of so much the more note, by how much the larger than the other.
8, <HI>Osachite,</HI> another Provincial Town of the <HI>Floridans. 9, Apatache,</HI> an ancient Native-built
Town, probably once of some note and resort, at least taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for such, which
<PB N="250" REF="322">
made them the more eager to take it under the conduct of <HI>Pamphilus Narvaes,</HI> in hopes of
finding there great riches. Doubtless it was then a place much larger, and more considerable,
than to consist but of 40 or 50 houses or cottages, (as hath been by some delivered) since it
was capable of making so smart a resistance as it did when it was attack'd, and of repelling them
after the departure of <HI>Nervaes. 10, Ante,</HI> another ancient Town or Village of the <HI>Floridans,</HI> chief|ly
remarkable for a sharp Ingagement between them and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom at this place, though

any thing else peculiar to this Province above the rest of <HI>Florida.</HI></P>
<P>It was by the care, charge, and industrious endeavours of divers noble persons, as <HI>Edward</HI>

may in all likelihood invite a far greater, as well from <HI>New-England</HI> and other parts that way,

<P>The most apparent boundary between <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> appears plainly by Mr. <HI>Ledderers</HI>

a Field, in which they usually practice their sports and exercises of activity. Their Houses are

<HI>Kasriocam</HI> and <HI>Mencherink;</HI> which, though on the <HI>Virginian</HI> side of the River <HI>Rorenock,</HI> yet are
accounted rather belonging to <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey, as it is now in possession of the <HI>English,</HI> is divided and governed according to
a platform and model drawn up by my Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> with the consent and approbation of
the rest of the Lords Proprietors, judged by many serious persons that have perused it, of equal
advantage to the Inhabitants, with any that ever hath been yet experienced, in respect of the
equal ballance of the interests of all parties.</P>
<P>The whole Province is divided into several Counties, each containing forty square plats of
12000 acres a piece: of these square plats, eight are to be divided among the Lords Proprietors,
that is, each to have one, with the title of a <HI>Signory;</HI> eight more among the Nobility, of which
there are to be three in every County, a <HI>Landgrave,</HI> and two <HI>Cassiques;</HI> only the <HI>Landgrave</HI> to
<PB N="253" REF="324">
have double the proportion to the two <HI>Cassiques;</HI> that is, four to their two a piece; the rest
containing 24 acres, falls to the people: and this division is to be observed alike in every
County; by which means one fifth of the Land comes to the Proprietors, another to the No|bility,
and three to the People. The <HI>Signories</HI> or Lands belonging to the Proprietors are to
be hereditary, and descend with the Dignity to their Heirs, and in like manner the Baronies.</P>
<P>The Parliament which is to be <HI>Biennial,</HI> is to consist of the Proprietors, the Nobility; and
for the people, one chosen out of every District by the Freeholders; which representatives are
to have a free Vote in the making of Laws; the force whereof is determined to set a time,
<HI>viz.</HI> sixty years, or thereabouts, to prevent the incumbrances and mischiefs arising from
the multiplicity of rules and penalties, which the longer a Law continues, are liable to
be increased and perplexed by the cunning of such as make a gain by the practice of the Law.</P>
<P>Besides the Parliament which hath the Legislative Power, there are e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ght supreme Courts for
the dispatch of all publick affairs. The first is that of the <HI>Palatine;</HI> for so the eldest of the
Proprietors is stil'd, who hath power to call Parliaments, and dispose of publick affairs. The
second is the <HI>Chief Iustices,</HI> for the judging of Criminals, and trial of Causes about Right and
Propriety. The third is the <HI>Chancellor's Court,</HI> which is for the passing of Charters, and mana|ging
the grand affairs belonging to the Province. The fourth is the <HI>High-Constabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> which is
for the ordering of the <HI>Land-Militia.</HI> The fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h is the <HI>Admirals,</HI> for the disposing of the Naval-Forces,
and other Maritime affairs. The sixth is the <HI>High Stewards,</HI> which inspects into the busi|ness
of Trade. The seventh is the <HI>Treasurers,</HI> which looks after the incomes and disbursements
of the publick Stock or Treasury. The eighth is the <HI>Chamberlain's,</HI> which marshals and orders the
ceremonies and fashions in all great Marriages, Burials, and publick Solemnities. All these
Courts (each of which consists of one Proprietor, and six Counsellors; whereof two are
<PB N="254" REF="325">
chosen by the Nobility, and two by the People,) joyned together make up the Council of State,
or Grand Council, by which all affairs of highest concernment are managed; and to which
the last appeal lies in all Causes belonging to them. There is also a Court in every County,
and in every District another: in each of which, to prevent long Suits, whereby the people
suffer, only to enrich a numerous Tribe of glib-tongu'd Orators, no Cause is tried above once;
only an appeal to be made from an inferior to a superior Court, till it come to the Proprietors
Court, where the last determination is made without farther appeal: neither indeed are there
any mercenary Pleaders allowed. And farther, to prevent the occasion of Controversies, and
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">s in Law; there is to be a Register of all Grants and Conveyances of Land.</P>
<P>Lastly, to prevent all disturbance and annoyance to publick or private weal and safety,
strict enquiry is to be made into the conversations of such as shall be found to have neither
estates not employments; such provision being to be made as shall take away all excuses of
following illegal courses: nor are any to be suffered to make a Trade of begging, who
have ability of body, and are obliged by necessity to work: since it is apparent that idle|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ess
and beggery are the source of all those villanies, which by the hand of Iustice bring so
many to untimely ends, whose lives might otherwise haply have one way or other conduced
to the service of their King or Countrey; and that it must needs be much more advantagious
to the publick to prevent the necessity of inflicting capital punishments, than to inflict them
when deserved.</P>
<P>As to the Government in point of Religious affairs, there is only this to be observed;
that a free toleration and liberty of Conscience is granted to all, excepting in the case of
Atheism, Profaneness, and debauchery of life, as destructive to all Government and humane
Society: whereas ceremonies and indifferent circumstances in Religion are judged to tend
most to disturbance, when most strictly and rigorously imposed.</P>

<HEAD>The Description of India.</HEAD>
<P>INDIA, by the Ancients simply so denominated, but by the Moderns sirnamed <HI>Orientalis,</HI>
for distinction sake; in regard <HI>America,</HI> or the new found World, is usually stil'd <HI>India
Occidentalis,</HI> or the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> is that Region of <HI>Asia,</HI> which under one appellation takes
up the largest part thereof; it being all that part which lies beyond the River <HI>Indus,</HI> now
<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">do,</HI> and bounded Eastward with part of <HI>China,</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean; Southward
wholly with the <HI>Indian</HI> or <HI>Oriental</HI> Ocean; Westward with <HI>Persia;</HI> and Northward with that
part of <HI>Mount Taurus</HI> which divides it from <HI>Tartary.</HI> This Countrey, as it was by the Ancients,
so is still primarily distinguished into <HI>India intra Gangem,</HI> and <HI>India extra Gangem:</HI> the first is
vulgarly term'd <HI>Indostan,</HI> the other <HI>Mangi;</HI> under which some doubt not to comprehend <HI>China</HI>
it self, already described.</P>
<P>It extends from the <HI>nequator</HI> to the 44th degree of Northern latitude, which makes the lon|gest
day 15 hours, and &frac12;; as in terrestrial length it reacheth from the Fountains of the River
<HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> to the utmost Promontory of the Golden <HI>Chersonese,</HI> six hundred <HI>German</HI> miles. So that the
temperature of the Air must needs be very diverse under so large an extent; lying partly un|der
the <HI>torrid,</HI> partly under the temperate <HI>Zone.</HI> Many vast and barren Desarts there are; but
generally the Soil is fruitful, and the Countrey abounding with things convenient for life: and
in some parts are produc'd most delicious fruits, especially the <HI>Palm,</HI> of which the people of
those parts make Wine more frequently than of the <HI>Grape:</HI> and for <HI>Gums, Spices,</HI> and all sorts
<PB N="257" REF="326">
of rich <HI>Drugs,</HI> it surpasseth all other Countreys: but that which is the chief glory of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
is, that the rest of the World receives lustre from the Diamonds, Rubies, and other pre|cious
<HI>Gems</HI> that are brought from thence. So that it so far out-shineth the opposite or <HI>Occidental
Indies,</HI> by how much these Gems exceed in value Gold it self; besides the great Trade that is
driven in many places in Silks, and other curious Stuffs, and rich Commodities; whereupon
they are much frequented, and resorted to by Strangers from all parts of the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> people are generally of a complexion somewhat tawny, tall of stature, and strong
of constitution, healthful, and for the most part long-liv'd, even many times to the age of 130
years, notwithstanding their addiction, above all other people in the World, to luxury and ve|nereal
exercises. It is permitted them to marry every man as many Wives as he can main|tain;
whereof, nevertheless, one of them hath a more peculiar respect, and observance, and a
predominance over the rest; for which she pays dear enough, if she survive her Husband; for
at his death she is obliged to throw her self into the same Funeral Pyre with him. They are
simple-hearted, and vold of all fraud and deceit in their bargains and contracts, and not given to
any quirks or cavils in the Law; and scarcely is there any such thing as the every known among
them: so that their houses have little or no need of the guards of locks and bolts, so usual and
necessary among us. The lowermost rank of people go very ill-habited, or rather almost stark
naked, except their head, feet, and what decency requires to have hid: but those of Quality,
Birth or Estate, go richly clad in Silks, fine Linnen, or other the most costly attire; and spare
for no adornments of Pearl, and the most precious of Gems; and they stand very much upon
the honour of their Birth and Family, observing a suitable grandure in their garb and retinue,
admitting not of any mixture of affinity with those of mean degree.</P>
<P>The strength of the <HI>Indian</HI> Militia consists in their <HI>Nairi,</HI> who are a select number of the No|bility,
<PB N="258" REF="327">
and better sort of Citizens; who from seven years of age are train'd up in all manner of
bodily exercises; by which, and by a continual inunction and suppling of their nerves, joynts
and bones with oil of <HI>Sesamum,</HI> they attain in time to an incredible dexterity and agility of
body.</P>
<P>The chief Ministers and Dispencers of the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religion, or ra|ther
Idolatry, are said to be of the stock of those ancient <HI>Brachmanes,</HI> who doubtless were the
same with the <HI>Gymnosophists,</HI> so term'd by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> among whom they had a very great
fame; being mentioned for their Learning and Philosophy by divers, both <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>
Writers; and reckoned in the same rank of honour and esteem as the <HI>Magi</HI> among the <HI>Per|sians,</HI>
and the <HI>Druids</HI> among the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Britains.</HI></P>
<P>The great Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> which for extent is doubtless the biggest in the World;
stretcheth in a continued ridge through the whole length of <HI>Asia,</HI> only under several names, as
<HI>Imaus, Emodus, Caucasus, Parapomisus, &amp;c.</HI> This Mountain <HI>Taurus</HI> is judged to be the same with
that <HI>Mount Ararat</HI> mentioned in holy Scripture, upon which the Ark of <HI>Noah</HI> rested after the
Flood.</P>
<P>Of the Rivers of <HI>India Oriental, Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges</HI> are the chiefest, and most famous; and of
the number of the most principal and largest of all <HI>Asia. Indus,</HI> which gives denomination to
the Countrey, and is now vulgarly called <HI>Hiind, Duil, Inder, Caercede,</HI> and by some <HI>Pengah,</HI> ta|king
its rise in <HI>Parapomisus,</HI> or <HI>Naugrocot,</HI> a branch of the Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> falls after 900 miles
course Northward, with seven mouths into the <HI>Indian Ocean,</HI> having taken in by the way 19
navigable Rivers; the chief whereof are <HI>Hydaspes,</HI> and <HI>Hypasis,</HI> which terminated <HI>Alexander</HI> the
Great's expedition. This River, where broadest, is accounted 50 furlongs broad; where
deepest, 15 paces deep. <HI>Ganges,</HI> now <HI>Guencam,</HI> from her uncertain original (some say the
<PB N="259" REF="327">
Mountain <HI>Ima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI>) falls into the Ocean; having, according to the testimony of <HI>Pliny,</HI> taken in by
the way 30 Navigable Rivers. This River, where narrowest, is accounted two <HI>German</HI> miles
broad; where shallowest, 100 foot deep. It is moreover famous for the 460 Channels, cut
like so many wounds out of its sides, by <HI>Cyrus</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> in revenge for the drowning of
an Horse, upon which he set a very great value.</P>
<P>The Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> is so promiscuously spread throughout that part of <HI>India</HI>
which lies within <HI>Ganges,</HI> that there are reckoned up no less than 37 Provinces or Kingdoms
under his Dominion.</P>
<P>But because his Dominion doth not exactly comprehend all <HI>Indostan,</HI> or <HI>Interior India:</HI> others
have chosen rather to divide it into those several Regions which have been adjudged the pro|per
contents or comprehensions of it. In most of which, however, the <HI>Mogul</HI> hath the greatest
share, if not the intire Iurisdiction of them, namely these 14 following; 1, <HI>Dulcinda,</HI> in which
the chief Cities and places of note are <HI>Caximir, Roree, Sestan,</HI> and <HI>Multan. 2, Pengah,</HI> supposed

<P>The <HI>Russian</HI> or <HI>Moscovian</HI> Empire is divided into 30 Provinces, whereof several are Dutchies
and Principalities, <HI>viz. 1, Moscovia,</HI> properly so called; the Principal City whereof, and not
only of this Province, but of the whole Empire, is <HI>Mosco,</HI> seated on a River of the same name,
but five miles in compass, since burnt by the <HI>Tartar:</HI> it contains 16 Churches, built for the most
part like the houses of mud and wood: but the chief ornament of the Town is the Emperor's
Palace, like a Town for largeness: next it is the Palace of the Patriarch. This City is defended
by two Castles, <HI>Kitugorod</HI> and <HI>Basigorod:</HI> the next Town of note is <HI>Sloboda,</HI> a Bishop's See. This
Province extends from East to West 600 <HI>German</HI> miles: and, besides the inferior Souldiery, fur|nishes
the Great Duke with 3000 <HI>Boiares,</HI> who serve in the nature of the <HI>Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">kish Timariots,</HI> or

seated on the Confluence of the <HI>Volga</HI> and <HI>Occa,</HI> and guarded with a strong Castle hew'd out of
a Rock by the Great Duke <HI>Basi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ius,</HI> and adorned with a stately Temple, reported to be built in
imitation of that of St. <HI>Sophia</HI> at <HI>Constantinople.</HI> In some out-skirts of this Province (rather than
in distinct Provinces) there may be said to live (rather than inhabit) sculking up and down
in Woods and Wildernesses, two rustick people; the <HI>Czeremissi</HI> wonderfully swift of foot, both
men and women, and most expert handlers of the Bow and Arrow: and the <HI>Mordwits,</HI> the

on the banks of <HI>Volga,</HI> have both the Titles of Dukedoms, and belonged heretofore to the
Great Duke's second Son: the first is one of the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> Sees, and guarded with a Castle;
the other a Bishop's See, <HI>Vologda</HI> is also a Bishop's See, and fortified with a strong Castle, where
the <HI>Czar</HI> keeps part of his treasure. 8, <HI>Duina,</HI> as it were <HI>Twain,</HI> so called from its principal
Town, and that from the River upon which it stands; in which are united the streams of <HI>Iuch</HI>
