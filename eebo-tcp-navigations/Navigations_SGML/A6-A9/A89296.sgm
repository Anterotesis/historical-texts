<HEAD>A more perfect and exact Relation of the great and memorable Sea-fight between the Engli&s;h and the Dutch, on Tue&s;day Wedne&s;day, and Thur&s;day la&s;t; with the true particulars thereof, and the number &s;unk and taken.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe Hollander having made &s;everal bold At|tempts, even up to our very Cinque-Ports of Dover and Sandwich, his Excellency General Blake called a Councel of Officers, who with great alacrity, unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to give a check to their in&s;olency; in pur&s;uance whereof, the whole fleet weighed anchor, who after few hours &s;ailing, came within &s;ight of the Dutch Navy on Tue&s;day la&s;t; and bea|ring up to them, the enemy prepared to receive 'em, which the General perceiving, made all the po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t he could to action, &s;o that immediatly began a great di&s;pute, which continued for the &s;pace of four hours; and with great va|lour and courage, on both &s;ides, was the conflict maintain|ed;
<PB N="4" REF="3"> the On&s;et was extreme hot and violent; and with great fury did we &s;alute each other; the General conceiv|ing that this might po&s;&s;ibly be his la&s;t before he &s;ealed all his faithful &s;ervices with his precious bloud, charged twice through the enemies fleet with the Royal Soveraign, and the Re&s;olution, receiving many a great Volley from them, which did exceedingly rent and tear his Sails and Tack|ling, e&s;pecially the Re&s;olution; yet ble&s;&s;ed be God in his own &s;hip he lo&s;t not above three men, onely &s;ome few wounded.</P>
<P>Captain Bodilo performed &s;ingular &s;ervice, and was in|gaged even in the very thicke&s;t of action, being &s;urround|ed by &s;ix &s;tout Men of War; he received many dangerous &s;hot, had divers wounded, and about 20 &s;lain; but at la&s;t, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Speaker, the Greyhound, and Dia|mond, &s;he got &s;afe off, but being di&s;abled for the pre&s;ent, was forced to &s;trike into Yarmouth, to be new cork'd and rigg'd up. Two Merchants that were likewi&s;e in the &s;er|vice having received &s;everal &s;hot under water, and being neer &s;inking, were forced to make to the &s;hore. Many of our &s;hips are much rent and torn, being mo&s;t of them ex|tremely engaged; but what our lo&s;s of men at pre&s;ent is we know not, yet thus much I may ingenuou&s;ly infer, that in &s;o &s;harp a Conflict, di&s;puted with &s;o great gallan|try and re&s;olution on both &s;ides, but &s;ome lo&s;s mu&s;t needs be &s;u&s;tain'd: However, confident I am, that the enemies is far greater, for we have &s;unk their Rear-Admirall, a gallant &s;hip carrying about fifty Guns, and their great &s;hip that carryed 68 Guns, being the greate&s;t that was ever yet &s;et forth by their high and mighty States, and the fir&s;t time that ever &s;he engaged in &s;ervice; Our men boarded her twice, but was both times repelled; and the third time be|came ma&s;ters; yet not long they could enjoy her, for even
<PB N="5" REF="3"> in a moment of time, they were forced to de&s;ert her, by rea&s;on &s;he had received many &s;hots betwixt Wind &amp; Wa|ter, which cau&s;ed her &s;uddenly to &s;ink, yet 6 of our men peri&s;hed in her, time not permitting them liberty to e|&s;cape forth.</P>
<P>We &s;unk al&s;o another of their Men of War; and took their Vice Admiral, and two more lu&s;ty &s;hips. After which, bearing up clo&s;e to them, with a Re&s;olution to hail and boord, the enemy began to decline engagement; but our General gave Order to embrace the pur&s;uit, in obedience whereunto, we cha&s;ed them all day of Wedne&s;day, and part of Thur&s;day, till we came within &s;ight of their own &s;hore; during which time, the fight was extreme hot, and great was the execution; but what further lo&s;s the ene|my &s;u&s;tained, we know not, yet certainly it mu&s;t needes be very great; for from Tue&s;day in the morning till Thur&s;day in the evening, the noi&s;e of the Canon was continually heard, and in our pur&s;uit we ply'd them clo&s;e with round &s;hot; though notwith&s;tanding Admiral De-witte and De-Ruttyer re&s;olutely returned us many a thundering Vol|ley; and indeed, to deal plainly, the major part of them fought very gallantly; notwith&s;tanding which, it plea&s;ed Divine Providence to crown us with Victory, and &s;o to di&s;&s;ipate their great Armado, that many of them are forced to betake them&s;elves to Harbour. We are now making up to the Downs, with the whole fleet, and the Generall intends to &s;end out Scouts, to ob&s;erve the motion of the enemy; touching which, I doubt not but to give you am|ple &s;atisfaction very &s;uddenly; in the interim, I &s;hall onely pre&s;ent you with a general Li&s;t of what hath already hap|ned; as more evidently apppears by the inclo&s;ed.</P>

<P>CAptain Bodilaw, Commander of the Paragon, one of the States &s;hips, with the Phoenix Frigat, and two o|ther
<PB N="8" REF="5"> men of war coming from the Levant; and having with him 4 good Merchant &s;hips, being come down neer to Lei|ghorn, the Dutch who do &s;till keep our &s;hips blocked up in that port, re&s;olved to go out to fight our &s;hips, &amp; there|fore made choice of ten of their be&s;t men of war, who went out leaving &s;till 6 behind them to keep ours in the Har|bor: The fight continued neer 3 dayes, and the Dutch ha|ving &s;pont much valour to become ma&s;ters of our men of war, four of the Dutch be&s;t &s;hips &s;urrounded Capt. Bodi|law, as being the be&s;t &s;hip and Admiral of the Squadron, fought him very &s;toutly above 4 hours; but after they were forced to fall off and leave her, yet not without great lo&s;s, and likewi&s;e on our &s;ide many killed and wounded: During which time, the other &s;hips were in a hot di&s;pute, and the Captain of the Phoenix attempted to boord one of the Dutch &s;hips who had lo&s;t her Ma&s;t, and after &s;ome di&s;pute became ma&s;ter of her, but the gaeedine&s;s of plun|der having made our men too negligent of their own Fri|got, and another Dutchman coming up on the other &s;ide, and finding her void of men, &s;oon became ma&s;ters of the Phoenix, and regained their own, took our Capiain and his men pri&s;oners and by rea&s;on of the neer approach of the night carryed them &s;afe away; our &s;hips are gone to Por|tolongone, and the Dutch returned to joyn with tho&s;e they left at Leghorn.</P>
