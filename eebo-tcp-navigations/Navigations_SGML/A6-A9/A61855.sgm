<P>_HISTORY, which is the <HI>Light of Truth</HI> and <HI>Life of Memory,</HI> hath two Eies, viz, <HI>Chronology</HI> and <HI>Topo|graphy:</HI> That, giving Evidence of Things and Acti|ons as to the Time, This, as to the Place.
<Q>Among Hi&s;tories (&s;aith an incomparable Doctor) Itineraries have the preheminence, in which we have the mo&s;t memorable Things and Events faithfully related <HI>ex</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, (as he phra&s;es it) or, from Eie-wittne&s;s:</Q>
The Utility and Certainty whereof may be me&s;ured from the Reputation and Con&s;cience of the Relater.</P>
<P>AND the&s;e, as they are more delectable to read, becau&s;e ever in|ter&s;per&s;ed with Actions as well as Things, &s;o they are more to be valued in re&s;pect of their Credit. <HI>Thucydides</HI> that mo&s;t excellent Hi&s;torian was highly accounted of by <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;eus, Cicero, Fabius,</HI> and others famous in the World; but abov all by <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> the noble Orator of <HI>Athens,</HI> who to make his works the more familiar to him|&s;elf, is affirm'd by <HI>Lucian</HI> to have copied them 8 times over; and all this for his Faithfullne&s;s and Credit, being him&s;elf a chief Captain in the <HI>Pelepone&s;ian</HI> Warrs, and an Eie-wittne&s;s from the Beginning to the End.

he took little or nothing upon Credit, having him&s;elf travailed thr&ocirc; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the World, and con&s;equently (with the help of his great Judgment and Experience) able to correct the Mi&s;takes of others, who had made too bold Conjectures.

<P>SUCH Ob&s;ervations as pertain to various Regions and Diver&s;ity of Countreys may al&s;o &s;eem to giv a more general Satisfaction, and to be of greater Utility than De&s;criptions peculiar to one place; <HI>Semper laudata fuit hi&s;toria quae non unius regionis cancellis con&s;tringitur; &s;ed quam lat&egrave; terrarum termini extenduntur, expatiatur.</HI> They are <HI>L'Empereur's</HI> Words.</P>
<P>BUT as it is not needfull that I &s;hould make many in&s;tances of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations in general, as to their U&s;efullne&s;s, &s;o I &s;hall not weary my Readers Patience further than what I &s;hall &s;ay to the&s;e in particular, which is the only rea&s;on I have to u&s;e the formality of a Preface, that might as well have bin left out, if &s;om few rea&s;ons had not urg'd me to the contrary, but chiefly to anticipate what I pre&s;age &s;om will object again&s;t them, a&s;well as in con&s;ideration of what a Great Man in the la&s;t Age &s;aid, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Era&s;m. de Utilit.

<P>OUR Traveller without doubt will fru&s;trate the expectation of &s;om, in not giving a more ample account of every Countrey he has &s;een, by an accurate noting down of the Religion, Politie, particular Rites and Cu&s;toms of the Inhabitants, nor making a further &s;crutiny as to the Antiquity and Original De&s;cent and Off&s;pring of the People as &s;om have don. 'Tis undeniably &s;o, for I find him more bu&s;y in recording
<PB REF="3">
the circum&s;tances of his own per&s;onal condition, and what befell him in remote Places, than remarking the State and Quality of the Land and People, nor do I hold it con&s;i&s;tent with the Duty of him that would be a faithfull Interpreter to do that Office for him; notwith&s;tanding the Freedom &s;om has a&s;&s;umed in another Language (or &s;hall I &s;ay, Another Work) to leav out more than 70 intire Paragraphs, in &s;everal places thr&ocirc; the Book, and &s;upplied the vacancy by tran&s;cribing out of other Jour|nals, which I am confident is not to be found either in the Authors Autograph, or Printed Copy.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman's rea&s;on, I conceiv, was becau&s;e the Matter of what he thought good to ommit was not &s;o &s;olid, containing &s;om homely Pa&s;&s;ages not to be taken notice of, and con&s;equently would not endure &s;uch &s;oaring Language, as things more &s;ublime and im|portant would, for, <HI>Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius.</HI> Nor had it bin le&s;s warrantable for me to have don the like, and tacitly to have pa&s;&s;ed over &s;uch humble Matter as would rather challenge an expre&s;&s;ion of homely Sentences than fe&s;tivity of Style, which the friendly Reader will find I'me no where guilty of.</P>
<P>THIS Journal, I am bound to &s;ay (notwith&s;tanding the main Ad|vantages our Author wanted, both in E&s;tate and Parts, which you'l readily inferr no Traveller ought to be without, that would bring his Ob&s;ervations upon the public Theater of the World) have never|thele&s;s found a gremious entertainment among&s;t all &s;orts of Men, being already publi&s;hed in &s;everal Languages: nor can I find any rea&s;on to fear, but, as it is for a more univer&s;al Peru&s;al taught to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> 'twill be as acceptable to our own Nation, as it has bin abroad in other Countreys, where they are in general more inclined to read Fictions and Fables, than true Philology, and &s;uch as may ju&s;tly be convinced by that of an ob&s;cene, but witty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Martial.</HI> in his <HI>10</HI>th Book of Epigrams.</NOTE> Poet:
<Q><PB REF="4">
<L>Qui legis Oedipodem calligant&egrave;mque Thye&s;tem,</L>
<L>Colchidas &amp; Scyllas, quid ni&s;i mon&s;tra legis?</L>
<L>Quid te vana juvant mi&s;erae ludibria chartae?</L>
<L>Hoc lege, quod po&s;sis dicere jure, Meum est.</L></Q></P>
<P>OBSCENE indeed inclu&s;ivly, but ju&s;tifiable enough in this, for, as the great <HI>Ca&s;aubon</HI> in his mode&s;t An&s;wer to the Epi&s;tle of Cardinal <HI>Du Perron</HI> &s;aith, <HI>E felle mero mel merum interdum exi&s;tit,</HI> &s;o there is nothing &s;o corrupt or putrid, but that &s;omthing &s;ound may be extracted from it.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY the Di&s;crepance of Mens Fancies mu&s;t be notedly great, if the Price and Peru&s;al of this &s;mall Volum &s;hould &s;eem too great and laborious to the Buyer and Reader, which has co&s;t the Author &s;o much Time and Pains in Travail, for the greate&s;t part of Six and Twenty years, during which time he has bin attended with continual Perils on the one hand and un&s;peakable Sufferings on the other: by Land in per|petual Jeopardy of his Per&s;on for Robbers, Cannibals, Ravenous and venemous Animals; by Sea for Pyrats, Shipwracks, &amp;c. and by both, &s;ubject to Hunger, Thir&s;t, Scorching Heats, Colds, Sickne&s;s, and other unavoidable Extremities and gravaminous Solitudes; be&s;ides the lamentable Condition of Slavery, in which I found him both among <HI>Turks, Tartars</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> yet after all returned home in &s;afety, and at this pre&s;ent here in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a thing no le&s;s cu&s;tomary than unmannerly among &s;om, who will hold all things for forged and fal&s;e, except what them&s;elvs &s;ee, and would have all them&s;elvs &s;ay to be received for Oracles. 'Tis not long ago that a young Sycophant (and one perhaps, who thought him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;omthing prejudic'd) affirmed that the Pourfiles of tho&s;e <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Citie and others, were but imaginary Fictions, and that, I beleev, be+cau&s;e the Etcher had &s;et the Letter [<HI>In.</HI>] for [<HI>Invenit</HI>] after his Name as who &s;hould &s;ay, but that every Engraver and Etcher under&s;tood &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="4">
much Latin, as rightly to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>Pinxit, Invenit, Sculp|&s;it, Fecit</HI> and <HI>Excudit,</HI> which they often u&s;e promi&s;cuously for each other: but be&s;ides my knowledge of our Travailers ability in Drawing, I have other rea&s;ons to give credit to him, as to his faithfull Delineation of tho&s;e Places, which, for this time being &s;o narrowly circum&s;cribed, I am forc'd to ommit.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Voyage perhaps may not affoard &s;uch &s;atisfaction as &s;om will expect, and by con&s;equence give the Reader no Appetite to go forward; but he who&s;e lei&s;ure will permit him to go forward, will in the 2d and 3d Voyages find amends for what is defectiv in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>IT was intended al&s;o to publi&s;h his 4^t^h^. Voyage with this, which has not as yet bin printed in any Language, but finding the Authors lei&s;ure not an&s;werable to tho&s;e Intentions, we &s;hall deferr it for the next Edi|tion, if this prove but &s;o acceptable, as to give occa&s;ion for another: which we know is not u&s;ual with Books of this nature, that &s;erv no more than for once reading, and not for a dayly recour&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Voyage we find him imbarqued for <HI>Genoa</HI> in a new Ship, which, with another, was built for that State at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in the year 1647. From <HI>Genoa</HI> he went to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> where by the way he gives a very exact De&s;cription of the <HI>Salt-I&s;lands, Sierra Liones, Madaga&s;|car, Syam,</HI> (with the mo&s;t horrible Ma&s;&s;acre committed upon the greate&s;t Per&s;onages in that Kingdom) then proceeds on his Voyage for <HI>Iapan,</HI> where he gives you an account of that I&s;land and <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;econd the mo&s;t remarkable is the Ingagement between the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> by Sea, in which the former fought a &s;ignal Victory. In this Voyage I al&s;o find a very accurate De&s;cription of the <HI>Greek</HI> I&s;lands, as they are now peopled, with &s;everal Foot&s;teps of An|tiquity.</P>
<P>IN the third, and la&s;t as yet extant, he goes to <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> to &s;erve the <HI>Czar</HI> aboard a new Ship which was built on the <HI>Wolga,</HI> whereby
<PB REF="5">
the way he gives you a De&s;cription of <HI>Lifeland</HI> and its Inhabitants, as al&s;o <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> and the Imperial City <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI>; then proceeding forward he comes at la&s;t to the <HI>Wolga,</HI> where &s;etting &s;ail for <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> notes punctu|ally what every day occurred. Arriving there he gives you an account of the In&s;urrection and Proceeding of the <HI>Co&s;ac</HI>-Rebels, and the occa&s;ion why he and his Company fled over the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; with the great hard|&s;hip they &s;uffered till they got a&s;hoar, where be&s;ides many cruel Tor|ments were made Slaves by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> in which condition he con|tinued till he was redeemed by order of the Governour and Council for the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company at <HI>Batavia,</HI> whither he travailed thr&ocirc; <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and being by order of the &s;aid Company &s;ent home aboard the Ship <HI>Europa,</HI> which was taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the la&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars; he him&s;elf was &s;ent for <HI>Ireland</HI> with about 300 more of his Countrey|men.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Set &s;ail from <HI>Texel.</HI></NOTE>My Father, who&s;e Rigour was &s;omewhat more than tolerable, was never remi&s;s in reprehending me for any noted Vice; &s;o that for &s;ome bad deportment he once took occa&s;ion to Cha&s;ti&s;e me, and that with &s;uch &s;everity, that I re&s;olved to take my leave both of him, and my native Land. At that time there were two Ships fitted out, and bound for <HI>Genua</HI>: the one was called, The St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t, Henry Chri&s;tan&s;z.</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Ma&s;ter, the other, The <HI>St. Bernard, Iohn Ben|ning</HI> of <HI>VVe&s;ep</HI> Vice-Commander, and <HI>Herman Voogd</HI> of <HI>Schiedam</HI> Ma&s;ter; Over both the&s;e Ships was Mr. <HI>Iohn Maas</HI> of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> as Up|per-Commander. The former was mounted with 28 Guns, the latter carried 26. I hired my &s;elf aboard the St. <HI>I. Bapti&s;t</HI> for Under-Sailmaker, being then about 17 years old, never troubling my &s;elf either whither we were bound, or how long we were to be out.</P>
<P>On the 26 of <HI>December</HI> 1647. By Gods good Conduct, we &s;et Sail, from the <HI>Texel,</HI> but were hardly got without the <HI>Gaats,</HI> ere we found that our Ships were not duly poiz'd, and thereupon were fain to Tack about, and put in at the <HI>Texel</HI> again, where we unloa|ded part of the Ships-burthen, and took in a con&s;iderable quantity of Pewter, &s;ome Boxes of Quick&s;ilver, and other ponderous Ma|terials, to Balla&s;t us well at the Keel; which when we had done and all ready, we &s;et out the &s;econd time, that was upon the 4 day of <HI>Ianuary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">January, 1648.</NOTE> 1648, and with a brave Wind, we pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Spaniards Gat,</HI> driven with &s;ome Shoals of Ice (it being then Fro&s;ty weather) Seawards.</P>
<P>On the 10 of <HI>Ianuary</HI> we were forced by a contrary wind to put in at the <HI>Downs</HI>; where after two days aboad, we weighed anchor, having both Wind and Weather favourable. But &s;oon after by a

heavy Storm and rough Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>FEBR. 1648.</HI> Storm at Sea.</NOTE> we were forced again to put into &s;ome other Harbour; which we did at the I&s;le of <HI>VVight,</HI> &amp; there we &s;tay'd till the 25^t^h when the Weather began to grow more moderate, and the high Winds abated.</P>
<P>Under hopes that this good Weather would continue we fet &s;ail, but were no &s;ooner out of the Bay, before the Weather changed, and we now the third time forc'd to look out for a Harbour.</P>
<P>On the 6 of <HI>February</HI> we came to Anchor at <HI>Portland,</HI> where we road three days, and then &s;et &s;ail directly for the Bay of <HI>Gibralter,</HI> where we arrived on the 10^t^h of that moneth. The next day with a brisk gale we entred the Straits, and with a con&s;tant and favourable wind, made <HI>Genua</HI> in 15 days, where arriving we dropp'd Anchor behind the Mold.</P>
<P>On the 32^t^h we got <HI>Prattica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival de <HI>Ge|nua.</HI></NOTE> and Licence to unload both the Ships; which done the Men were paid off, and di&s;mi&s;s'd. The Ships, as we &s;aid before, were &s;old to the Duke of <HI>Genua,</HI> which he furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ion of Victuals, Powder, Shot and other Ammunition, for 2 years. Aboard each Ship were a Hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> taken into &s;ervice, the re&s;t for the mo&s;t part <HI>Italians,</HI> among&s;t which were a few of the <HI>Banditti.</HI> Here I hired my &s;elf for Upper-Sailma|ker, and had 18 Livers <HI>per</HI> Moneth; although neither I, nor any el&s;e that went before the Ma&s;t, knew whither, or upon what De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Having now regain'd my liberty, I long'd to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity in taking a view of the Town, with what el&s;e was worthy of remark. <HI>Genua</HI> is &s;eated on the Sea &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;crip|tion of <HI>Genua.</HI></NOTE> having a very commodious and com|plete Haven, on the South facing the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of <HI>Affrica.</HI> The City is built partly on montanous and hilly ground, and partly on a Le|vel, &s;eated between two velleys; and is computed to be abut 6 Ita|lian Miles in circumference, being very well and clo&s;e built, muni|ted with &s;trong Walls, &s;ufficient enough to re&s;i&s;t a &s;mall Attacque; but would not &s;ecure the Town in a long and durable Siege; or vio|lent Storms, without the Militia. Their Militia con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;ican</HI> Companies, together with a few &s;mall Troops of Hor&s;e, which are con&s;tantly in motion, either on the Sea-&s;ide, or thro the City, to prevent, if need require, any &s;ilent Attacque, and &s;uppre&s;s Mutinies; as al&s;o to &s;ecure the Coa&s;ts from <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and other Pyrats, which &s;ometimes come a&s;hoar in their Shalops, to get Slaves

and Spoil. They have alwaies four Galleys ready upon all Oc|ca&s;ions, for Defence of the Havens; be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number more, which they have in their Ar&s;enal, in good equippage; the&s;e are often imployed as Auxiliaries for the <HI>Venetians,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI> On the Sea-&s;ide &s;tands a Watch-Tower, on which by night they &s;et a Beacon; and ju&s;t at the Entrance of the Haven, &s;tands a huge piece of Ordnance, mounted upon a Carriage, continually guar|ded with a Sentinel. The Dukes Per&s;on is guarded with a Body of 500 Soldiers, who with their Colonel have a place allotted them in the Palace. The City is generally well built with &s;tately Hou&s;es and magnificent Structures, more e&s;pecially on that &s;ide which is &s;eated near the Sea: having be&s;ides the more eminent Ho&s;tels and Public Buildings, 30 fair Pari&s;h Churches, of which that dedicated to St. <HI>Laurence</HI> claims the priority, as Cathedral.

The City is very popu|lous, their Merchants rich and numerous; and their Manufactury al&s;o very con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in Velvets, there being according to the relation given us; above 8000 Looms in the Town &s;o that con|&s;idering the Magnificency of Building, the Riches of her Mer|chants, Commodiou&s;ne&s;s of Situation, and Splendor of her Court and Palace, may be reckoned as a Town of the fir&s;t Magnitude.</P>

<P>On the 29 of May we weighed Anchor, and with a bri&s;k gale of Wind reached the Straits mouth on the 2 of <HI>Iune.</HI> When we were pa&s;t <HI>Gibralter,</HI> we &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e towards the <HI>Salt I&s;lands,</HI> which was de&s;igned for another place of Refre&s;hment, from whence we gathered that, our Voyage mu&s;t needs be longer than at fir&s;t we thought; for till then none aboard the &s;hip (unle&s;s the Officers)

<P>On the 3 of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we arrived in the Bay of <HI>Sierra Liones.</HI> Imme|diately upon our arriving there, the Commander &s;ent the Shallop a&s;hoar, and &s;uch per&s;ons as he did think fit, with Pre&s;ents for the King, which were 5 Barrs of Iron, a Barrel of Brandy, and another of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e men that were nominated to deliver the Pre&s;ents, were courteou&s;ly received by the King and his Court.

The King and his Folk were equally in&s;atiable and covetous; for &s;o &s;oon as the King had received the Pre&s;ent, he de&s;ired as much more, which the Commander was content to &s;end him, that he might have the freedom to take in Water, and Wood for Fewel, as al&s;o to provide our &s;elves with Oranges, Lemmons, and other Refre&s;h|ments.

The Commanders wrath thus pacified, he gave order to throw him over board, which was immediately obey'd and executed, by 4 of the Ships Company, who threw him out at the Fore-ca&s;tle Port; But he was &s;o well di&s;ciplin'd in &s;wimming, that he pre&s;ently got a&s;hoar. His Retinue &s;eeing that, with all the ha&s;t they could, be|took them&s;elves immediatly to their Canoes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hou&s;es of the <HI>Caffers</HI> pillaged; and their Or|chards Spoil'd.</NOTE> and made as if they would do &s;ome prodigious Feat, or other; or at le&s;t ob&s;truct our com|ing a&s;hoar, to take in what was nece&s;&s;ary. The Commander, who&s;e temper was too couragious, to be daunted for a &s;warm of Flies, &s;ent two Boats a&s;hoar to fetch Water and Wood, both well Man'd and Arm'd, and in &s;pite of all their Force, hew'd as much Wood, and brought as much Water, as they thought might &s;erve our turn, The Commander notwith&s;tanding all this, was not yet content, but remanded the men and Shallops to pillage their Hou&s;es and Or|chards, and &s;et the Kings Neger-hou&s;e on fire; all which they did in a moment. The King &s;eeing this, thought it high time to put him|&s;elf in a po&s;ture of Defence; and in order to that, mu&s;ters up all the Forces he could on a &s;udden, the whole Countrey being Alarm|ed, and appear'd with a number of a Thou&s;and Canoes, or more, half of each being loaden with Faggots, whether to &s;et our Ships on fire, or to u&s;e them for Shields, we could not determine: how|ever having obtained our ends, we held it be&s;t to weigh Anchor, and proceed on our Voyage, rather than to incurr a needle&s;s &amp; unprofi|table Ingagement, with a Company of &s;uch contemptible Schoun|drels.

that in mo&s;t places in <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> they make merchandi&s;e of their Children, and that by rea&s;on of their not being in a capacity of bringing them up, but never (like tho&s;e of <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI>) take away their lives. This they are induced to by an implicit Faith, being per|&s;waded by their Prie&s;ts, that they are born upon unhappy days, and &s;hall be &s;ubject to great mi&s;ery and afflictions &s;o long as they live; or that the Planet under which the Child is born, has &s;ome bad influence upon it; and having view'd the Palms of his hands, and his Face, make conclu&s;ion that he will be either Thief, or Parricide, &amp;c. Upon the&s;e and the like Occa&s;ions, they deliver the Child over to a Slave, which he is to carry out of the way, and throw it into a Ditch or un|der a Thorn-hedge, where the poor Infant mu&s;t either die of hun|ger, or be devoured up of Dogs, or other Bea&s;ts of Prey. Others there are among tho&s;e Women, who when they are with Child if they find them&s;elves never &s;o litle out of order, immedia|mediately a&s;cribe the cau&s;e to the ill Nature of the unborn Babe, and either kill it before it come into the World, or &s;o &s;oon as it is born bury it alive, and &s;ometimes throw it into the Water. If a Woman &s;lave chance to prove with Child by her Patron, and be turned away; &s;o that &s;he be not able to bring it up, &s;he either &s;trangles, or di&s;patches it before it come into the World: and &s;ometimes a white Wo|man having a Child by a Negro, if &s;he &s;ee it re&s;emble the Father, or have curl'd hair: as al&s;o their Young-women, who make them&s;elves pro&s;titute for Gain, follow the like Cour&s;e, but commonly murther the Infant before it be born, deeming it but a burthen to them, and a hindrance of their Profe&s;&s;ion. But be&s;ides all the&s;e inhuman Cu|&s;toms they have another no whit inferiour to tho&s;e already &s;aid, that when the woman dies in Child-bed, the Child is thrown alive with the Mother into the Grave, &s;aying. <HI>Better it is that the Child dies, than to be brought up by &s;trangers.</HI> And becau&s;e &s;o many days are by them held infortunate, almo&s;t half of the Children are di&s;patch'd, which with other occa&s;ions already mentioned, is undoubtedly the rea&s;on that this great, happy and mo&s;t fruitfull I&s;land is not very popu|lous, where not only Polygamy is allow'd, but al&s;o &s;uch freedom given to the unmarried to &s;atisfy their lu&s;t, and libidinous ends.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The Body of the Prince&s;s burnt. A remarkable token, whereby, it was concluded that &s;he was poy&s;oned. The Kings fury again&s;t all the Dome&s;tics of the Prince&s;s, who are committed to cu&s;tody. The cruel Puni&s;hment of the &s;u&s;pected Parties. A &s;trange wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to find out the guilty. Elephants u&s;ed as Executioners. Fifty men and Women executed in one day, &s;ome by Elephants, others buried in the Earth, to the Head, where they are &s;uffered to &s;tarve. A Young Lady with her Brother taken and di&s;pat|ched. Their Candour, and free re&s;olvedne&s;s to die.</HEAD>
<P>TWo days after the Corps were brought forth, the King went him&s;elf in per&s;on, and gave fire to the wood with a Torch, which was done with great Solemnity, and Mu&s;ic of all &s;orts, that all the time play'd very dolefull Airs. The Che&s;t of Gold, together with all the Co&s;tly Ornaments, wherewith &s;he was attired, when &s;he lay in &s;tate, were burn'd with the Corps, and reduced to du&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An odd Pa&s;&s;age.</NOTE>We may not ommit to relate a very remarkable pa&s;&s;age which hap|pened about the&s;e Exequies; for when the King went to gather up the A&s;hes, which were to be put in a golden Urn, he found a piece of Fle&s;h, about the bulk of a Young childs head, fre&s;h and uncon|&s;umed. This &s;eeing, he was mainly altered, and turning about to one of the <HI>Magi</HI> who &s;tood at his left hand, Asked him; What his opinion was? and, What might be the rea&s;on that this gobbet of

fle&s;h remained unburn'd. The Sage judging it to be done by &s;ome Enchantment, dur&s;t not declare his opinion about it; but to &s;atisfy the King, replied, That his Maje&s;ty could not but be &s;en&s;ible of the Cau&s;e, &s;ince nothing could ly occult from his &s;earching Wi&s;dom: the more in regard it was a thing &s;o palpable and open. The King by the Saying of this Para&s;ite, concluded with him&s;elf that &s;he had been poy&s;oned, cries out with great raging, <HI>At length I have di&s;co|vered the certainty of what I ever had in &s;u&s;picion: My Daughter is without doubt poy&s;oned.</HI> Upon that in great di&s;content he went into his Mourning appartment whence he i&s;&s;ued an Order for the &s;udden Apprehen&s;ion of all the Ladies, that attended the Prince&s;s in her Life time, who were in obedience to his Royal Will immediately &s;ecured.</P>
<P>On the day following divers others of the greate&s;t rank were &s;iezed and committed to Cu&s;tody, who were wont to conver&s;e with the Prince&s;s, although they had not been in her pre&s;ence for the &s;pace of a whole year.</P>
<P>Shortly after it was my fortune to be Spectator to &s;uch a cruel Tra|gedy as ever I have &s;een el&s;ewhere. The King being now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed wthi Jealou&s;y, and &s;u&s;pecting &s;everal to be factious in the matter, yet could not find out any certainty in the thing; he therefore to &s;ift it out, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;e &s;hould be that were concerned in the deed, practi&s;ed this cruel Stratagem and impious way of Trial.

After he had congratulated my happy return, asked me, What cour&s;e I was bound to take?

<P><HI>Leghorn</HI> is &s;o well known of all Gentlemen and Marriners that have &s;een <HI>Italy,</HI> that it may &s;eem needle&s;s to de&s;cribe it. Neverthele&s;s &s;ince it is a part of my Province, to take notice of &s;uch Towns as are in any regard eminent and famous, I &s;hall not ommit to &s;ay &s;omething briefly of it.</P>
<P>This City which is one of the chief Havens in renowned <HI>Italy,</HI> was by <HI>Francis</HI> and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> great Dukes of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> upon con&s;ideration of it's commodious &s;ite rai&s;ed from a mean village to a great Empo|rium. The &s;aid Dukes fortified it with a &s;tone wall, &s;ince which time it was gradually advanced by the encouragement of Trade; and is at pre&s;ent &s;trengthned with 5 Bulwarks and 2 Cittadels, or Forts the one whereof commands the Haven, and the other &s;ecures the Town on the Land &s;ide, towards <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> which is furni&s;hed with 60 great Guns. About 6 Engli&s;h miles from the City is a Beacon for direction of Marriners by night, there being many Rocks toward the South that are often the occa&s;ion of Ship-wrack, and is therefore called <HI>Malhora.</HI> The&s;e Rocks do cau&s;e impetuous breakings of the Sea, which yet render the entrance of the Haven more free and &s;ecure. So that Ships and Galleys may ride &s;afely at anchor in this Road. The City on the out-&s;ide appears more magnificent than it is indeed in|wardly: The Fronti&s;pieces, as well of Privat as Public Buildings being plai&s;tered, upon which are painted Sea-fights, Hi&s;tories and Land|&s;chap. In the midle of the Town is a &s;tately Market place and an Exchange, where (as at other Places) Merchants meet and negotiate their Affairs. Corn, Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h and other nece&s;&s;aries are here very

good and cheap, which occa&s;ions almo&s;t all that are bound farther up to put in there for Refre&s;hment. On a Corner Stand four &s;tatues in bra&s;s, repre&s;enting the Father and 3 Sons, who attempted to row away a Galley, belonging to the Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>; and ply'd &s;o &s;trongly that the re&s;t of the Galleys, had enough to do to overtake them, and were ready to yield it for lo&s;t. The&s;e 4 men were <HI>Moors,</HI> and for that notable E&s;&s;ay, are recorded with their Images in mettal which are &s;et one again&s;t another, with their Hands behind their back.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Leghorn</HI> I &s;et forward for <HI>Pi&s;a</HI>: but before I was got half way, was a&s;&s;ail'd with 4 Highway men, who were well mounted and arm'd: two whereof allighted, and clapt their Pi&s;tols to my brea&s;t, bidding me deliver my money. In the mean while they fell a &s;earching of my pockets and breeches, but not finding my money, which I had &s;titch'd up in the lining of my Coat, they gave me 2 bunches of Grapes, and rode away.</P>

But the &s;aid <HI>Frederic Barbaro&s;sa</HI> being ca&s;ually drowned, the Galleys returned back again, all freighted with Earth, of which they &s;ay the Church-yard is made.</P>
<P>On the 23 towards night I left <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> and went to <HI>Florence</HI>; Between which two Towns is the mo&s;t delectable Fields and Valleys, that ever I have &s;een, either before or &s;ince, in&s;omuch that I thought my Journey neither long nor irk&s;om, though on foot.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="51">On the 26 I entred <HI>Florence,</HI> which is &s;eated in a plea&s;ant Valley' and divided by the River <HI>Arno</HI> into two parts, which is the &s;ame River that runs by <HI>Pi&s;a.</HI> On the We&s;t it hath the Champane land which is admirably delightfull: on the Ea&s;t the Countrey is Hilly, and &s;tored with abundance of Fruit-trees, and on &s;ome part it is for|tified with the <HI>Appenin</HI> Hills. This City is reckoned about 7 miles in compa&s;s, and enjoys a &s;ubtile and whol&s;om Air, which renders the Natives and Inhabitants more acute and of a &s;harper Genius than tho&s;e that Inhabit, or are born in places of a gro&s;&s;er: The City which is divided by the River, is again united by four &s;tately Bridges. which &s;o beautify the Town that perhaps gave <HI>Charles</HI> the Arch-duke occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that this was a City only to be &s;een on Holy-days. The fertile Hills and rich Valleys wherewith it is environed, affoard the In|habitants plenty of all nece&s;&s;aries. Here is the Court and Re&s;idence of the Duke: The Palace being one of the mo&s;t magnificent in all <HI>Italy,</HI> yet far more &s;pacious and &s;plendid within than without: but to recount the &s;pacious Halls, Pompous Antichambre, Marble Statues and Pictures in the Galleries, with all it's Appendencies, were an endle&s;s labour. Right over again&s;t the Pallace is a Lifeguard, con|&s;i&s;ting of a hundred <HI>Germans.</HI> Before the Palace is al&s;o a very &s;tately Fountain, adorned with huge Statues both of Marble and Bra&s;s, out of which &s;prings Water, being all in emblematical repre&s;enta|tions. Upon the <HI>Mercato Novo</HI> is a very &s;umptuous Building in which the Citizens, meet and treat about the affairs of Merchandi&s;e. The Palace of the <HI>Medici</HI> is a &s;tupendious Fabric, and for artificial car|ved works, a&s;well in Wood as Stone, and Pictures of the mo&s;t eminent <HI>Italian</HI> Ma&s;ters, &s;eems to aemulate the famous <HI>Vatican.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e are many other inferior Palaces, Bublic Puildings, Churches, Chappels and very &s;pacious Cloy&s;ters, all which would take up &s;ome moneths to make an exact &s;urvey of. In many &s;treets are Galle|ries or <HI>Piazzas,</HI> (as in <HI>Covent Garden,</HI>) where one may walk to avoid either Sun or Rain. Here are al&s;o many Hou&s;es built for Cha|ritable u&s;es, where the Sick are relieved with what they &s;tand in need of; and every one of tho&s;e Hou&s;es kept very neat and clean, e&s;pecially the Ho&s;pital adjoyning to the Church <HI>Alla Nunciata.</HI> Yet above the many famous Structures which grace <HI>Florence,</HI> the Hou&s;e of <HI>Prattelino</HI> outbraves them all, which was built by <HI>Francis de Medicis.</HI> The fir&s;t

you come at is the Palace, which is rai&s;ed upon a &s;quare Fund, or Platform, which entring, you have at fir&s;t view four Chambers that are oppo&s;ite to one another, and &s;tand al&s;o in quadrangular form, &s;o that the 4 quarters are again &s;ubdivided each into 4 le&s;s, which make 16 Appartments. In one of the&s;e &s;tand 2 co&s;tly Beds, one for the Duke, and the other for the Dutche&s;s. The re&s;t of the Cham|bers are hang'd with Tape&s;try, and &s;ome with Cloth of Gold, un|&s;peakably rich; and illu&s;trated with artificial and co&s;tly Statues, which are &s;et in convenient Places thereto ordained. In like manner when we went up another &s;tory, we found 16 Chambers more, paralel with the Platform of the former. In every one of the&s;e was a &s;tately bed, the meane&s;t whereof is computed to have co&s;t more than a Thou&s;and Crowns. Comeing out of the Pallace you come <HI>alla Grotta,</HI> which is a fair Arch having therin a Fountain, that &s;eems rather to be Natural than performed by Art. Round about the Fountain are Snakes, Ad|ders, Lizzards and other Serpents, &s;o artificially made in Bra&s;s that they might be taken for Living. On each Pillar &s;tand Organs, which are moved by the force of Water, in &s;uch manner, that they make a mo&s;t lovely and &s;weet Harmony. The Walls are in &s;everal places &s;o thick &s;et with Gems, Coral and other things of value, that they cannot be per|ceived. The re&s;t is &s;et with Marble. About the middle &s;tand fair Alaba&s;ter Tables, to which if you draw near, the Water ri&s;es from under your feet, and flies all over your head and bodie, but indeavoring to &s;hun it, you are again &s;aluted after the &s;ame manner from another place. On the other &s;ide is another called <HI>Grotta Sibylla,</HI> which is al&s;o very co&s;tly, and &s;et out with many fair Statues of Marble and Alaba&s;tre, richly adorned with Coral, where are al&s;o curious Water-works, none ever coming there but is wet with tho&s;e &s;ubterranean Showers. On your right hand is the Bath of the Prince, which is under full of holes, through which the warmth can come to cau&s;e Sweat. Be&s;ides the&s;e there is a third Arch, which is for the Heat in Summer, whither the Duke and his Hou&s;hold retire to refrigerate them&s;elves. In this Arch, is a fair large Table of Alaba&s;ter, and at each end &s;everal Holes, in which they &s;et their wine to cool. There is belonging to this Hou&s;e a plea&s;ant Garden, wherein are many Springs and Ponds: and every rare and choice Tree that will like in that Clime. Behind this Garden is a Park, full of &s;trange Birds and Bea&s;ts, and therein a &s;tately and

delight&s;om Arbor where the Duke frequently dines in the Summer &s;ea&s;on, and from whence he can view both his Palaces, the one with|in the City and the other without. Right over this afore&s;aid Garden is yet another, in the middle whereof is a Chappel, where the Duke for the mo&s;t part goes to Ma&s;s, and Ve&s;pers. This Chappel is built round, after the manner of the Heatheni&s;h Temples of old, planted round with Cypre&s;s trees, and has all its inner works of that Wood. Near to that &s;tands an Image of 24 foot high, which will repre&s;ent <HI>Neptune,</HI> or <HI>Thetis,</HI> made of White marble, from whence all the Waters in the Fountains have their Ri&s;e: upon which if a man &s;tands he hears a wonderfull murmuring and buzzing of Water from below.</P>
<P>This City is a place of great Traffic and Commerce, e&s;pecially in Silks and Velvets, of which I &s;aw many rich &s;hops upon the <HI>Ponte Pecchio,</HI> or Old Bridge. The <HI>Florentines</HI> them&s;elves are very able and skillfull in the Affairs of Merchandi&s;e, and very litle Traffic don in <HI>Italy</HI> wherein they have not an intere&s;t; &s;o that Pope <HI>Clement VI</HI> called them the fifth Element. Be&s;ides their dome&s;tic and exotic Trade, they have given encouragement to, and bred up many, ingenious and famous Ma&s;ters in Architecture, Painting, Carving and other Practical Sciences and Arts, and have for a perpetual memory and Gratitude &s;o many &s;tately Pallaces, Churches, Pictures and Statues left them to Po&s;terity. This City is al&s;o very Courtly in re&s;pect of it's Situa|tion, through which all Amba&s;&s;adours and Mini&s;ters of State from forreign Potentates mu&s;t pa&s;s, intending for the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> or Seignory of <HI>Venice.</HI> It is much frequented, vi&s;ited and likewi&s;e inha|bited by many Private Gentlemen, who &s;pend their E&s;tates here, and is a choice place to live in as well for Artificial as natural De|lights, for &s;uch as have an E&s;tate to bear it out with. However, I had litle rea&s;on to complain of bad mea&s;ure during the few daies I &s;taid there. For meeting accidentally with a Monk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Chri&s;tian Monk.</NOTE> who &s;eeing me to be a <HI>Hollander,</HI> did not only care&s;s me all the time in &s;uch manner that I needed not pay any thing either for Lodging or Diet, but al&s;o &s;how'd me all what was remarkable about the City. This Monk un|der&s;tanding that I was &s;hort of Moneys, and intended for <HI>Venice,</HI> procured me 4 Rix-dollars, which was as much as I had occa&s;ion for, to bear my Charges thither.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depar|ture from <HI>Florence</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>On the 1^&s;^t^. of <HI>March</HI> I left <HI>Florence,</HI> and took my leave of the

<P><HI>Bologne</HI> lies about 44 degr. being a Town of &s;mall circumference, yet wealthy and full of Inhabitants. The form of the City &s;eems to re&s;emble a Ship whereof the Tower <HI>d' A&s;inelli</HI> is the Ma&s;t. It has ever been a Maxim among them not to &s;uffer either Cittadel or Fort to be built, under the &s;pecious name of Fortification, being jealous that under &s;uch a colour they might check the Citizens at their plea|&s;ure; So that the <HI>Bologneezes</HI> have nothing to rely upon, than only the Walls, and valour of their men. The City is founded on the Banks of the famous <HI>Savona,</HI> which River incorporates with the <HI>Rhem</HI> a litle above <HI>Ferrara,</HI> by which way all Goods are conveighed. The Air is here for the mo&s;t part moi&s;t, which renders the circumjacient Countrey very fertile, there being the be&s;t Meadows and Arable ground in all <HI>Italy.</HI> There is al&s;o very good Wine, Olives and Oil: although Fi&s;h they have none except what is brought from a far; but Veni&s;on in great abundance. In this place are made &s;uch Sau&s;a|ges, as are &s;ent abroad for great rarities, which &s;ome would per&s;wade us at home are made of A&s;&s;es fle&s;h: but my curio&s;ity induced me to make &s;uch examination of that matter, that I found it otherwi&s;e; for they are made of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Yet no|thing is more co|vered and eaten by the Jews.</NOTE> Pork and Mutton. Be&s;ides the Traffic in the na|tural Products of the Land, they are great Encouragers of Manufa|ctories, and e&s;pecially in Silks. The Streets are very fair and &s;pacious, and at each corner is erected a Conduit, or Fountain. The Hou&s;es on the out&s;ide &s;eem as if they were quite gone to decay, yet within are very &s;umptuous and co&s;tly, quite contrary to tho&s;e in mo&s;t places in <HI>Spain,</HI> that I have &s;een, where every Hou&s;e by the Fronti&s;piece &s;eems rather a Palace than a private Dwelling, yet within na&s;ty, full of &s;piders-webs, and void of Uten&s;ils, pure Emblemes of Hypo|cri&s;y. During my aboad there I found not any thing extraordinary, as worthy of Remark, unle&s;s the Tower of <HI>Gari&s;enda,</HI> which is built crooked on purpo&s;e, for a proof of Art: although &s;ome hold the Churches of this City (if taken in general) to &s;urpa&s;s all others in any particular Town in <HI>Italy,</HI> more e&s;pecially in regard of the ma|ny and rich Images, both of Gold and Silver, but their ground

<P>AFter I had &s;taid 2 days at <HI>Bologne,</HI> I &s;et forward for <HI>Ferrara,</HI> where being arrived I found it a dead Town, having nothing of Trade; but on the contrary many places void and unbuilt, a &s;ure and evident token of the declining condition of that City. Notwith&s;tan|ding all that, there are many curious Structures in <HI>Ferrara,</HI> e&s;pecially on the River <HI>Po,</HI> which runs that way, and expatiates it &s;elf in Tren|ches or Ditches through the Town. It is &s;trengthened with many &s;trong Bulwarks and Ramparts, and has many &s;pacious and airy &s;treets, with Piazzas on each &s;ide along the Hou&s;es. Be&s;ides this, I could not find any thing worthy of remark, and certainly it was no time for me to con&s;ume my &s;mall E&s;tate upon &s;uch unprofitable Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>On the 6 <HI>ditto</HI> I left <HI>Ferrara,</HI> tending my journey for <HI>Chioggio,</HI> but by the way met a Foot-padder, who pillag'd me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au|thor ri|fled.</NOTE> and took away 2 Rixdollars, which were given me by the Monk at <HI>Florenza,</HI> and left me about 20^d to help me to <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

Neverthele&s;s I knew that I could li&s;t my &s;elf when I would, and receive advance-money: and after a litle Inquiry, met with Mon&s;r. <HI>Theodore de Haan,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Golden Cock,</HI> who took me on as Sail-maker. It was not long before the Ship was in her due equippage, and &s;et forth in order to joyn with the Ar|made of <HI>Venice,</HI> which was upon an Expedition again&s;t the Turks in the <HI>Dardanelli.</HI> But <HI>de Haan</HI> having received letters from <HI>Holland,</HI> about &s;ome urgent affairs of his own, re&s;igned the Command to his Son, and went home by Land.</P>
<P>On the 10^t^h of <HI>April</HI> we &s;et Sail from <HI>Venice,</HI> in company with the <HI>Grand St. George,</HI> which was then commanded by the Sieur <HI>Court Adelaar</HI> afterwards Admiral of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and lately decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 20 <HI>ditto</HI> we arrived at <HI>Xante,</HI> where we &s;upplied our &s;elves with fre&s;h Water, and took in &s;ome Pipes of Wine, which is here exceeding good, and tolerably cheap: for the <HI>Barillo,</HI> a mea&s;ure of about 5 Gallon, or rather more, co&s;ts but a <HI>Scudo,</HI> that I &s;uppo&s;e is equivalent with 5^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 8^d <HI>Sterl.</HI> which again is vended in the Armade for 6 Crowns.</P>
<P>On the 22 we departed from <HI>Xante</HI> directing our cour&s;e for <HI>Milo</HI>; and on the 5^t^h^. of <HI>May</HI> got the heighth of that I&s;land, but did not touch there, &s;teering directly between <HI>Milo</HI> and <HI>Argentero</HI>; and here we came to anchor, but too near the coa&s;t of <HI>Argentero,</HI> for we were annoyed with mud. Upon this aro&s;e a great Storm of Wind, which rock'd us to and again, and at la&s;t broke our Cables. We endeavored all we could to get Sea room, but the Wind being towards the Land, drove us flat again&s;t the Coa&s;t, where the Sieur <HI>Adelaar</HI> &s;eeing us in &s;uch danger, &s;ent off his Long Boat with 5 or 6 men to fetch a Per&s;on of Quality from aboard us, who was a Superintendant of &s;ome emi|nent Place, under the Juri&s;diction of the Common-wealth: but all the re&s;t of the Gentry, with about an Hundred Soldiers and Marriners &s;tayd aboard. Soon after, the Ship was ca&s;t upon a Rock with the violence of the Sea, where &s;he &s;plit all in pieces: in &s;uch manner as no tongue can expre&s;s, nor pen decipher, that a Ship of &s;uch Bur|then, like a Plank was thrown &s;o high above Water, and in the

twinkling of an eie da&s;ht into a Thou&s;and &s;hivers. Lamentable it was to hear the pitifull moan of &s;o many that were Parents for their Children, Men for their Wives, Wives for their Husbands, Chil|dren for their Parents, and every particular for their Friends and Al|liance, The Ma&s;ter of the Ship and my &s;elf got a Ma&s;t, which, what by the boy&s;trous Wind, and what by the violence of the Floods, did &s;o tumble and roll, that we could not keep it in a due ballance, &s;o that we thought be&s;t to look out for &s;omething el&s;e, and by Hea|venly Providence met with the great Hatch, which came driving with &s;uch force again&s;t the Ma&s;t, that it had almo&s;t &s;ent us both to &s;ound the Deep. However indeavouring to &s;ave our Lives, we got fa&s;t hold of the Hatch, and won the Shoar. All the re&s;t were drowned to 19 Men, and 2 Women; the one whereof was a <HI>Venetian</HI> Lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Gentle|woman wonder|fully pre|&s;erved.</NOTE> who&s;e Husband was a Captain in that Expedition. This Gentle|woman, after a long and weari&s;om beating thro the Surges, and Foamings of the Sea, was thrown mother-naked upon Land, but mo&s;t mi&s;erably torn and rent with Nails and Splinters; having ac|cording to the report made by the Chirurgeon, above Fifty Wounds and Holes in her Body: yet notwith&s;tanding all this, was more grie|ved to hear of the lo&s;s of her Husband, than &s;en&s;ible of her own calamity: However con&s;idering the extreme cold &s;ea&s;on, and her weak condition, we covered her Warm with cloaths and Bedding. The other Woman that was &s;aved, was the wife of a Privat Soldier, who was great with child, had driven Six and Thirty Hours upon a piece of the Hulk, and to our great admiration was taken up alive. It was certain that &s;he could not have endured any longer being already &s;tiff and benummed, and us pale as a Corps.

We then

de&s;ired, that we might have a <HI>Tartan</HI> to tran&s;port us to the Armade, in order to admit our &s;elves again into the &s;ervice of the Common|wealth. To this the Governour gave his a&s;&s;ent, and with a Ship and 15 men, and &s;ome Ammonition di&s;patched us for the Armade.</P>
<P>On the 3 of <HI>May</HI> we &s;et Sail from <HI>Candy,</HI> but were put to our allow|ance at the rate of 2 <HI>lib.</HI> of Bread each man a day, upon a Calculation of 10 days, and &s;o con&s;equently 20 <HI>lib.</HI> the Voyage.</P>
<P>On the 8 <HI>ditto,</HI> we came clo&s;e under <HI>Mytilene,</HI> and found that our Provi&s;ion was already &s;pent, &s;o that it was re&s;olved by the major part of the Company, that we &s;hould go a&s;hoar and &s;ee out for &s;omething to &s;upply our Wants, although we knew that the I&s;land was under the Juri&s;diction of the Turki&s;h Emperour. However &s;eeing there was as much Danger on the other hand, we chu&s;ed rather to adventure our &s;elves on land, than to &s;tarv aboard: and accordingly 12 <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> and 15 <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;tept a&s;hoar, and &s;eeing a drove of Cattel we took 6 fat Kine, which we led to the Boat and &s;o got them hoy&s;'d aboard, one by one. This fair beginning encouraged us to go further within land and about a mile from the Creek where the Tartan lay, found a &s;mall village of about 10 or 12 Hou&s;es, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot any appearance of either man, woman or child, who we concluded had hid them&s;elves for fear. In the mean while finding no &s;carcity of Bread, Meal, Butter, Chee&s;e, Honey, Wine and Oil, we pick'd and chu&s;'d each what he had a mind to, and having pack'd up more than we could carry, we thought it a &s;in to leave any thing behind us: we therefore went a litle out of the Village, where we found about 20 A&s;&s;es, the&s;e we took and loaded with our Spoil, and in our return to the Shallop e&s;py'd a Ca&s;tle which before we had not &s;een, and thither we &s;uppo&s;ed that the Pea&s;antry of that Hamlet were fled to &s;ecure them&s;elves. But in coming forwards, we found that there was but one high way to the Boat from the Village, and that clo&s;e by the Ca&s;tle; for every man had fenc'd in his Ground with a high Flint-wall: neverthele&s;s coming pa&s;t the Ca&s;tle we met with no ob&s;truction or annoyance in the World, till being got about half-way I looked about, and &s;pied 200 Troo|pers following us as hard as they could drive, whereupon I cried out, <HI>Gentlemen, Here comes a Command of Hor&s;e, &s;ee what you have to do, and re&s;olve without much lo&s;s of time, for if you do not behave your &s;elves coura|giou&s;ly we are all dead men.

Our men unani|mou&s;ly gave me (for the time being) the honour of a Chieftain, in lieu of a better. As for the <HI>Greeks,</HI> they were greater Strangers to martial Di&s;cipline than we, and ran confu&s;edly up and down without any order. When the <HI>Turks</HI> were ju&s;t come upon us, I gave charge that they &s;hould not fire all at once, but by 5 at a time, and that not till they had taken good aim, and the Enemy within &s;hot. With that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Commander (being a <HI>Moor</HI>) advanced upon a &s;tately Hor&s;e, was bound to level his Carbine, but to anticipate him I gave the Word to the fir&s;t Rank, who brought him down to the Ground and three more be&s;ides him. This falling out luckily the &s;econd Rank gave fire, and &s;o following the third, till we &s;aw above 20 of the Enemies Party dead, that gave us no &s;mall encouragement; but on the contrary &s;o di&s;heartned the Enemy that they began to retreat; for be&s;ides the great advantage we had of the High walls of Flint, which &s;erved us for a Rampart; our Arms were large Mu&s;quets, and theirs but &s;mall Carbines, which at that di&s;tance could not do much Execution. When they were gone a good way back, we climbed over the Wall, marched along the high way with four in a Rank, and kept our &s;elves together. The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeing that faced about on a &s;udden, clapt &s;purrs to their Hor&s;es, and came driving upon us with a mo&s;t horrid &s;houting; thinking &s;o to bring us out of our Ranks, and to put us into a di&s;order: which if they could have effected, had &s;erved their turn. But our men the &s;econd time faced about and levelled their Mu&s;quets, till we had them at a due di&s;tance and &s;o we fired for a good while together, without either gaining or loo&s;ing ground; till at la&s;t the Enemy &s;eeing them&s;elves con|&s;iderably weakned by the lo&s;s of their Leaders, were forced to retreat again till they were out of &s;hot: but &s;o &s;oon as we began again to march, they followed us, but in a very ea&s;y pace, in|tending (as we had colour to beleeve) to &s;urprize us at taking our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es aboard, but they &s;eeing us too near the Boat were content to let us alone for that time: for had they come we had

<P>ON the 9^t^h^. <HI>dito</HI> we left <HI>Mytilene,</HI> and with a brave Wind got <HI>Monte Sante,</HI> or <HI>Holy Mount</HI> in 2 days: This being the Hill (as the devout Romani&s;ts beleeve) whereon our Saviour was tempted by Sa|than, and from whence he &s;how'd him all the Riches of the Earth.</P>
<P>On the 12 <HI>dito</HI> we Sailed into the River of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where we found the Sea-Armade of <HI>Venice</HI> at <HI>Troy,</HI> which is the place and remnant of the famous <HI>Troy,</HI> &s;o much read of in the Poets of old, although it is hard to judge where the Town has verily &s;tood. All that is to be &s;een, is a Gate which is built of white Marble, and &s;eems to be exceed|ing ancient, and a &s;mall Village with the Foundations of a wall, that encompa&s;&s;e the Town 7 times, not in circular form, but as it were involved like a Snake, or the &s;pring of a Watch.

After they had fought &s;ome hours, the <HI>Turks</HI> boarded her abaft and got the Poop, which the <HI>English</HI> &s;eeing blew up the Decks, and &s;o &s;et the Ship on Fire, which neverthele&s;s when they &s;aw her on Fire to the Main Ma&s;t, cea&s;ed not to fire valourou&s;ly out at the Prow till &s;he began to &s;ink, which they mar|king betook them&s;elves to &s;wimming, rather willing to burn or &s;ink than &s;urrender them&s;elves or Ship upon di&s;honorable Terms. Howe|ver the <HI>Turks</HI> took up as many as they could, and made &s;laves of them. Aboard this Ship was an <HI>English</HI> Woman who kept a Hou&s;e of En|tertainment at <HI>Venice,</HI> notedly known by the name of Mrs. <HI>Penters,</HI> and one that was very kind to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> when in any &s;trait or trouble, and many of our Nation were &s;orry when they heard of her Death. The Ship <HI>Midleton</HI> was mounted with 36 Guns, and 60 Men, whereof about 40 were drown'd and burn'd, as we found by the Bodies we took up an hour and a half after the Battel. And after|ward under&s;tood by the Slaves we took in the Engagement at the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> that the Galleys were &s;o di&s;abled that they repented the A&s;&s;ault, be&s;ides more than 500 Men outright kill'd, and a far grea|ter number wounded.</P>
<P>While we lay at Anchor at the entrance of the Channel, and loating to and again before the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> the mo&s;t part of our men were quell'd with a Scorbutic di&s;temper, for want of fre&s;h Water.

To my great misfortune, I was &s;ent out with 7 more to fetch Water with a Boat; and coming to <HI>Troy,</HI> we &s;aw very rich Vineyards, at a di&s;tance, and mightily longing for &s;ome &s;uch refre&s;hments, we ca&s;t lots who &s;hould make the attempt to go and fetch &s;ome Grapes, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot fell upon me: wherefore without much lo&s;s of time I betook my &s;elf thither, viewing warily if the coa&s;t were clear, but &s;eeing no &s;tir or appearance of men; I went up undauntedly, where I made both Hands and Chaps move. But whil&s;t I was thus bu&s;y, heard a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oi&s;e, and turning me about, de&s;cried &s;everal <HI>Turks</HI> that had lay in

Our men were newly come a&s;hoar and filling their Casks with Water, who made all the ha&s;t they could, gain'd the Boat, loo&s;'d off from the &s;hoar, and eying the Enemy too earne&s;tly ran the Shallop upon a Sand, where they were &s;et fa&s;t; but having &s;ome Fire-arms aboard, they kept the <HI>Turks</HI> off, till they got the Boat adrift, and &s;o made their e&s;cape.

It was not long before they came to &s;ee what kind of a <HI>Fool,</HI> they had got in their Gin, where they found <HI>Peel-garlick</HI> ready to yield up the Gho&s;t for fear.

Which when I came to under&s;tand, began in all ha&s;t to repent my temerity, and foolhardine&s;s, and had thought my &s;elf more happy if I had been pilling of Turnips or Cucumbers at <HI>Durgerdam,</HI> than plucking of &s;uch &s;our Grapes, in a <HI>Trojan</HI> Vineyard.</P>
<P>How inhuman and barbarous our U&s;age was, no Tongue can duly utter nor Pen decipher.

<P>Having now for the &s;pace of 6 Weeks endured this wofull &s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au|thor makes his E&s;cape.</NOTE> we found an Opportunity to rid our &s;elvs of that mi&s;erable Slavery: for being now left to our Liberty to fetch Water for our &s;elves, my Camrade and I that were chain'd together went farther within Land than we needed, and &s;o returned hone&s;tly back to the Galley, and that for 2 or 3 times together, the better to prevent &s;u&s;picion, till at la&s;t, we ran &s;o far out of &s;ight that we thought our Enterprize half won. The night coming on, it began to rain, and we to &s;helter our &s;elvs, crept into a cave, where my Mate &s;truck fire and lighted his Wax-candle, that we might &s;ee to file: and after a litle labour got our &s;elves loo&s;e.

But being a very rainy night and &s;tormy wea|ther, the Sentinels did not attend their Po&s;ts, &s;o that we pa&s;&s;ed through the midde&s;t of them without any examination, and betook our &s;elves to &s;wimming before it was ob&s;erv'd.

For the &s;pace of one whole moneth we cru&s;ed upon the <HI>Turkish</HI> Armade, which we waited for daily from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> In the mean while tho&s;e of <HI>Maltha</HI> came up with their Galleys to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ar|mada, under the Flag of the <HI>Prior of Rochel.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> on the contrary had 28 Men of War. 9 Galea&s;&s;es, and 60 Galleys, tho&s;e of the <HI>Bey</HI> reckoned with them. The &s;aid Fleet was al&s;o full of men, and well provided with Ammunition.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="59">On the 23 the whole Armade came down with full Sail before the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> as if they would direct their cour&s;e for the I&s;lands of <HI>Greece,</HI> or &s;ome place in the <HI>Archipellago,</HI> aiming to make a breach &s;ometimes at one place, and &s;ometimes at another; But the <HI>Venetians</HI> were too vigilant to &s;uffer it; for they compo&s;ed their Fleet in &s;uch order, that the <HI>Turks</HI> could not find a Pa&s;&s;age. Neverthele&s;s the <HI>Maltheezes</HI> di&s;own'd them&s;elvs to be under the Standard of <HI>Saint Mark,</HI> but re&s;erved the Command of their own Galleys, as them&s;elves li&s;ted and thought good.</P>
<P>On the 24 the <HI>Turks</HI> held them&s;elves clo&s;e to the Banks near the two Ca&s;tles, mentioned before (in Pag. 80) which tended mainly to their advantage. Be&s;ides this they had thrown up two Batteries, one upon the Corner of <HI>Barbaria,</HI> on the <HI>Anatolian</HI> Side, and another, on the <HI>Greek,</HI> or We&s;tern Coa&s;t, from whence they play'd off their great Guns again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Navy, to work a pa&s;&s;age through for their Fleet. Three days long continued they on both &s;ides firing with their Canon, the Admiral of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as bearing the chief Standard; riding neare&s;t to the Enemy, and con&s;equenly &s;uffered more dammage than the re&s;t of the Navy: for the Turks threw out great Stones with their Bombs, that they killd three men on a bre&s;t, who &s;tood very near the General. In the&s;e Ca&s;tles are Guns of an incredible mu&s;&s;in, and as &s;ome &s;ay, tho&s;e in the outmo&s;t Redoubts 30 inches diameter. And although there was not any hope of doing the Enemy much harm, yet the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Fleet kept &s;till in good Or|der; waiting greedily for the <HI>Turkish</HI> Navy, which we thought would come out, when ours was a litle more di&s;abled. On the 26 they came out with full Sail, and in good Order, with &s;uch a hideous roaring and &s;houting, that we could not under&s;tand the words of Command, nor hear one another &s;peak. Their Ships as well as their Galleys were &s;o &s;tow'd with men, that they were a great incumbrance to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Wind was now at North, and favoured the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> have the benefit of the Wind.</NOTE> that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were almo&s;t blind and &s;tifled with &s;moak: yet the whole Fleet kept their Po&s;ts without giving way to the Enemy. The General to give a good example and encouragement to the whole Navy, put the Fleet in the form of a Cre&s;cent and him&s;elf in the Nombril; and &s;o expected the Infidels Armade: but they kept off at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, &s;till playing off their Cannon. The Wind and &s;tream

which favoured them again&s;t us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>JUNE.</HI> 1656.</NOTE> was al&s;o advantagious for us again&s;t the Galleys of the <HI>Bey,</HI> that were to the Rereward of us; who al&s;o fought couragiou&s;ly, and held their Po&s;t all the while. The <HI>Venetians</HI> did all they could to clo&s;e up with the <HI>Turks,</HI> but could not move forward and keep their due Order, thro rea&s;on of the Wind, and violent Breakings of the Stream, occa&s;ioned on purpo&s;e by the <HI>Turks</HI> in opening of their Fleet, that beat Strongly again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Navy. The Enemy in the mean while battered the Squadron of <HI>Marco Bembo</HI> with an ince&s;&s;ant &s;hooting of whole Tears and Broad|&s;ides, that all crack'd again; nor had <HI>Lazaro Mocenigo,</HI> and <HI>Gerolino Malipiero</HI> the Vice-Admiral, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> the le&s;t &s;hare in this hot Ingagement. But beyond all others, memorable was the magnanimous and re&s;olved Valour of <HI>Bernardo Bragadino</HI> Chieftain of the <HI>Contarina,</HI> a &s;mall, but a well-built Friggat: who notwith|&s;tanding the Enemy poured out great &s;hot, like Hail upon her, yet dured all the brunt of the battel thundring with her Cannon again&s;t the <HI>Turkish</HI> Galea&s;&s;es, that they were forced to remove their Po&s;t 5 &s;everal times. An admirable rare Courage! which if it either could, or had been &s;econded, by all the Naval Forces of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> then pre&s;ent, would have given &s;uch an Overthrow to the Infidels as no Age might paralel. Nor may we forget to commemorate the good &s;ervice of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who &s;erved as Auxiliaries in this Naval Expe|dition, and behaved them&s;elvs very well. The <HI>Turks</HI> now &s;eeing the prudent Conduct of the General, and undaunted Courage of the whole Fleet did all they could to draw off, fell down to the Sea|ward and retired into the Bay of <HI>Barbery,</HI> where they dropped Anchor, hoping that now they were in Sanctuary.</P>

<P>AFter the Chri&s;tians had long laboured to clo&s;e up with the <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>JUNE.</HI> 1656.</NOTE> but could not effect their Intentions, for the Wind blew hard at North, and North and by Ea&s;t, and the &s;tream &s;till falling with great Force upon their Ships and Galleys, rendred their Indeavours fruit|le&s;s, &s;o that they could not do any enterprize, than barely what was done with their Ordnance, they had re&s;olved to re&s;t a litle:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wind turns in favour of the <HI>Chri|&s;tians.</HI></NOTE> till on a &s;udden by Heavenly providence the Wind came about, and GOD, out of his un&s;peakable Goodne&s;s, granted the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> a helping Hand, almo&s;t after the &s;ame manner, as about a Hundred Years agon in the famous Sea-fight again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Don Iuan d' Au&s;tria,</HI> when the <HI>Turks</HI> had the Wind fair and favourable, till they came to engage with the Chri&s;tians, and then by the Divine Bounty of the Everla&s;ting GOD, the Wind turned to the advantage of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Fleet; in &s;uch &s;ort that the Chri&s;tians gave them the greate&s;t and mo&s;t fatal Overthrow, that ever yet was either known, or heard of, in the world. The General <HI>Marcello</HI> had no &s;ooner ob&s;erved that the Wind blew a litle Southerly, but he gave Com|mand to &s;et &s;ail, and &s;tretch the Oars, in order to give the <HI>Turks</HI> a &s;udden A&s;&s;ault, which was in obedience to his Will immediatly put in practi&s;e. The <HI>Turks</HI> being thus &s;urprized by our &s;ilent Attacque, and finding the Wind directly again&s;t them, were dreadfully di&s;mai'd: in&s;omuch that upon our entring the Bay we &s;aw them by whole flocks jump over board. Some ran with their Ships and Galleys bluntly again&s;t the Wall, others that lay at Anchor neare&s;t the Sea, &s;trove to drive through the Fleet and gain the Rere; and tho&s;e that &s;aw them|&s;elves not able to retreat, left the Ships, and betook them&s;elves to &s;wimming; few of which e&s;caped (for there runs a &s;tong Tide) and mo&s;t of them were carried to the Seaward, that we met whole Shoals

<P>The <HI>Sultan</HI> had aboard her divers Per&s;ons of Quality and Volun|tiers, who <HI>maximis ad minimos</HI> quitted them&s;elves well and honourably: among&s;t which was, Capt. <HI>Zorzi Dadick,</HI> The Sieur <HI>Ebert,</HI> Capt.

During the Fight, was the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, called <HI>'t Wapen van Na&s;&s;auw</HI> under the Command of Capt. <HI>Fau&s;tino Riva</HI> blown up with her own Powder, as al&s;o another <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship called <HI>Den David en Goliath</HI> by an unfortunate &s;hot in her Powder Chamber, when &s;he was ingaged with the Galleys of the <HI>Bey,</HI> and lay &s;o clo&s;e to the &s;aid Galleys that 5 of them were blown up with her.

The Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> was &s;o forward that his Companions were fain to re&s;train him by force, running him&s;elf oftentimes into a needle&s;s jeopardy of his Per&s;on. Remarkable was that of the General <HI>Borri</HI> being aboard the Galea&s;s of <HI>Marco Riva,</HI> who having his young Son by him, carried him up and down to &s;ee what was worthy of note. When the Night came on, they unanimou&s;ly left off on both &s;ides, and all was &s;till; but the next Morning by break of day, they fell on amain, and &s;eem'd for &s;ome hours to be equally match'd as that the Day was thought dubious, but at la&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> were fain to give over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courage of the Turkish <HI>Capitana</HI></NOTE> only the <HI>Capitana</HI> held out very manfully, till the Admiral <HI>Marco Bembo</HI> came to clo&s;e up with his Lar-board where he &s;aluted him &s;o with Broad-&s;ides, that he was forc'd to yield as well as the re&s;t.</P>

The number of tho&s;e that were wounded was great, but uncertain. The <HI>Sultan,</HI> and the 2 <HI>Dutch,</HI> men of War, which as we have already &s;aid were unfortunately de&s;troyed with their own powder, was all their lo&s;s of Shipping.

<P>There are be&s;ides this &s;everal &s;trong Holds and fortified Places throughout the whole I&s;land.

They make an excellent &s;ort of red Wine, which the <HI>Turks,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the voice of their <HI>Alchoran,</HI> greatly covet and &s;wallow when they can have

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival at <HI>Wol+mar.</HI></NOTE>On the 14 we arrived at <HI>VVolmar</HI> where we met many <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> Wag|gons, and Boors going to market with Corn and other Things.

<P><HI>VVolmar,</HI> is a litle, but a well-fortified Town, munited with a &s;tone-Wall and a deep Ditch, but without Water. The Market in regard of the Poverty of the Countrey is very con&s;iderable, and is held twice

a week. This City as appears yet by the Ruins of it, has been for|merly much greater than it is at this day, but with all the Countrey round about has been often depopulated by the <HI>Polish</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;sian</HI> Armies. It is about 18 leagues from <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P>On the 15 by break of Day, we &s;et forward on our Journey, pa&s;&s;ing through a Champaign Countrey, and many &s;mall Towns and Ham|lets. By the way we ob&s;erved that the Boors had burn't up great Woods, and converted them into Pa&s;turage and arable Ground. Afterwards we went through a large Wilderne&s;s, where we could not &s;ee the Sun, by rea&s;on of the den&s;ity of the Trees, yet the way was full of Mires, and pla&s;hy. About 7 in the Evening we came to our &s;tage, where we were to &s;tay over night. The next morning we broke our fa&s;t, yoked the Hor&s;es, and &s;et forward; pa&s;&s;ing over a huge River which had only a Bridge there where we were to pa&s;s over, and no where el&s;e within 20 leagues above or below: but the Bridge being old and &s;eemingly rotten, we dur&s;t not go over all together, but one by one. When we were got over, Evening came on, and the Sky began to grow gloomy, after which followed a very great Tempe&s;t that the River &s;well'd over the Banks and overflow'd all the flat Lands, which we &s;eeing &s;o &s;uddenly happen, left the common Road; for that our Land Pilot told us, that the High way was &s;ubject to &s;uch Floods with an extraordinary Inundation. After two Hours Stor|ming, the Weather began to clear and the Pilot a&s;&s;ured us we were not far from the Town where we were to take our nights re&s;t, and &s;o it happened, for ju&s;t as he was &s;peaking of it we &s;aw Light, through the Trees, which mightily revived us for we were extreme cold and weary. The next morning we &s;et forward for <HI>Pit&s;iora,</HI> and had very good Weather, but came &s;hort of the Town that night, in&s;omuch that we were fain to ly all night in the Woods, where we gathered all the Windfalls we could find and laid them on a heap, and with dry Sticks made a huge Fire, which &s;erved not only to warm our &s;elves at, but likewi&s;e to affright the Bears and Wolves away, which are very bold and cruel in the&s;e Parts, as al&s;o the Muskettos, which &s;warm here by Millions, and annoy both Man and Bea&s;t, after an incredible rate.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>OCTOB.</HI> 1668.</NOTE>ON the 30^t^h^. of October 1678 we arrived at <HI>Pit&s;iora,</HI> which lies on the Confines of <HI>Ru&s;sia,</HI> and under the Protection of that Empe|rour. It is &s;eated in a fair and plea&s;ant Countrey, affoarding all things nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;u&s;tenance of human Bodies. 'Tis true <HI>Pit&s;iora</HI> is no more than a Village, yet for wealthy Inhabitants, Commerce abroad and Advancement of Manufacture, &s;urpa&s;&s;es any City in all that part of the Countrey. In pa&s;&s;ing through the Town we &s;aw many rich Mercers and Drapers Shops; the Markets &s;tored with all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion, as Corn, Butter, Chee&s;e and Fruits, with a very noble Butchery or Fle&s;h-&s;hambles, and the &s;treets crouding with People from all Parts. So &s;oon as we were arrived, there came &s;everal Jewel|ers, who asked if we had any Pearls, or other Jewels to &s;ell or barter.</P>
<P>Having refre&s;hed our&s;elves at <HI>Pit&s;iora</HI>; we left the Town the next day about 10 in the Morning, and about noon entred a large Wood where we found great &s;tore of Hurtles or Bilberies, that were far greater and better ta&s;ted then any I have known el&s;e where; which moved me to fall a plucking of them; but going a litle way into the Wood, and making a ru&s;hing through the Thickets, up &s;tarts a huge Bear, which &s;o affrighted me that I had hardly power to run from him; however it &s;eem'd that he was as fearfull of me as I of him, for when I ran Ea&s;t he ran We&s;t, and glad I was to &s;ee his Bear-&s;hip turn tails with me. This was the only Bear that ever I had &s;een in <HI>Lifeland,</HI> or all the way from <HI>Riga</HI> hither, but the Boors often warned us to take care of our &s;elves, &s;aying that, &s;ometimes both Men and Cattel are devoured with tho&s;e cruel and ravenous Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>On that Evening we arrived at <HI>Pletskou</HI> where we had Lodgings and all nece&s;&s;aries provided us; and on the 22 payd our Waggoners who returned for <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="82"><HI>Pletskou,</HI> is a large City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>OCTOB.</HI> 1678.</NOTE> a great part thereof is &s;urrounded with a wall, the re&s;t with huge Balks like Pallizados, and computed about 8 [<HI>English</HI>] miles in compa&s;s. Their Hou&s;es are made &s;leightly of Trees and pieces of Timber, let in with joynts, without any Gentility or ornament. The Town it &s;elf gives a noble Pro&s;pect if you view it from without, by rea&s;on of the many Pari&s;h-Churches and Towers it has, but when you come within, it appears very ugly, the &s;treets are irregular without Uniformity, and the Hou&s;es built after multifarious manners, &s;o that the poore&s;t Village, in the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> is a Paradice in compari&s;on of <HI>Pletskou.</HI> 'Tis true they have &s;ome Hou&s;es of &s;tone, but the mo&s;t eminent and wealthy Citizens chu&s;e rather to live in Wooden-Hou&s;es than in tho&s;e, for that they &s;ay, The latter are more whol&s;om. Here I happened to meet with a <HI>Hamburger,</HI> and after we had exchanged a few words together, concerning our journey from <HI>Riga,</HI> I told him of my rouzing the Bear. He replyed that I was happy to make my e&s;cape &s;o, &s;ince not only men are &s;ometimes devoured by them, but al&s;o Hor&s;es and Kine, and withal told me, how that they dig up the Graves for the Bodies of the Dead, when they are hungry. But more lamentable was a &s;tory he told me, of a She-Bear, <HI>that in the year</HI> 1656. <HI>broke by night into a Hou&s;e in the Country not far from thence, where she had found the Woman of the hou&s;e with a &s;ucking, Infant in the bed with her. The woman she devoured, leaving only a part of her left leg and a litle of the Scalp, but the Infant was altogether mi&s;t, whence it was concluded that the Bear had eaten it up, as being young and con&s;equently more delicate. Not long after this di&s;mal hap, the Pea&s;ant took his Mu&s;quet with him into the Woods not far from his Hou&s;e, with intent to shoot an Otter which haunted his Fish-pond, and by the way e&s;pies a Bear, at which he levels his Mu&s;quet, and hits him directly on the skull. The Bear (as the cu&s;tom is when shot) rolls him&s;elf in a heap, the Pea&s;ant runs to her and finding it a Female, and her Duggs full of Milk, re&s;olves the next day to make &s;earch for her Seat, for then he thought that her VVhelps would be hungry and yell out. The day following he went out to &s;eek the Cave, taking</HI> 2 <HI>or</HI> 3 <HI>other Pea&s;ants with him, who being about the Middle of the VVood, on the &s;ide of a hill, heard a young child cry, and following the direction of the &s;ound, found his own Infant in the cleft of a great Rock, which he took and brought to</HI> Pletskou, <HI>to be nur&s;'d up by his VVives Si&s;ter, where out of curio&s;ity I went to &s;ee it.</HI></P>
<P>In the Suburbs of <HI>Pletskou,</HI> was to be &s;een a &s;hank-bone of a Giant,
<PB N="122" REF="83">
5 foot long,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>OCTOB.</HI> 1668.</NOTE> which together with the whole Skeleton, was found in a Tomb of &s;tone, by the Boors, when they were digging up the roots of Trees that they had burn'd up.</P>
<P>On the 26^t^h it began to freeze hard, and afterwards to &s;now, which made us unea&s;y for our delay, being con&s;trained to wait here &s;o long, till we received the <HI>Poddowodda,</HI> which is an Order given by his Imperial Maje&s;ty, that every Town we came at &s;hould furni&s;h us with Hor&s;es, Wagons, Bedding, and defray our other Char|ges. On the 28 towards night came an Expre&s;s from <HI>Mo&s;cou,</HI> and the next day we &s;et forward, intending fir&s;t for <HI>Novogorod.</HI> This part of our Journey was much more ea&s;y and delightfull than that through <HI>Lifeland,</HI> which was altogether de&s;ert and Mar&s;hy, this on the con|trary, inhabited and till'd.</P>
<P>On the 31^t^h we came at a great Lake before <HI>Novogorod,</HI> where we left the Sledges and were fetch'd over in a kind of a Cymb, or Boat which is made of a hollow tree, and by them called <HI>Knoos</HI>; of the&s;e they had two &s;orts, the one for Pa&s;&s;engers, who may &s;it 4 or 5 at a time, the other broader, and every way larger, fit to tran&s;port Goods. This Lake is very broad but &s;hallow, not having above 5 foot Water in mo&s;t places. When we were &s;et over, our Goods were put into Sledges, and brought after us into the Town.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through the Town we found the Suburbs far greater than the City it &s;elf, which as appears by the Ruins of the Walls, has been formerly a well fortified Place. In times pa&s;t it was neither &s;ubject to the <HI>Ru&s;sian, Swede,</HI> nor <HI>Polander,</HI> but had a Prince, who coined Money and ruled as ab&s;olute Soveraign, with an independent and arbitrary Power; Yea, to &s;o high a &s;tate was it once advanced, that it was grown to a Proverb, <HI>GOD and</HI> Novogorod, <HI>who is able to with|&s;tand.</HI> Their Pui&s;&s;ance I need not di&s;pute, &s;ince it is well known to tho&s;e that are acquainted with Geography what Sway the Princes of <HI>Novogorod</HI> have born, and what a name this City has had abroad for her Wealthy Merchants and great commerce with other Places. About the year 1477 it was be&s;ieged and &s;torm'd by <HI>Ivan Va&s;ilowitz,</HI> Great Duke of <HI>Mo&s;covia,</HI> who took away all the Priviledges and Im|munities of the Citizens: &s;ince which time their Wealth and Traffic began to decline and decay. However by rea&s;on of it's commodious Situation, it retains the foot&s;teps of its former Trade, and is e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="123" REF="83">
frequented by <HI>Swedes, Danes, Hamburgers</HI> and <HI>Lubeckers,</HI> who come up the River <HI>Nerva,</HI> with their &s;mall Shipping. The chief Commodities they deal in, are Wheat, Ry, Lin-and Rape&s;eed, Furrs, Hemp and Flax. The Countrey is ble&s;&s;ed with a good Soil, and produces &s;ufficiently enough of what is requi&s;ite to human &s;u&s;te|nance, which is here very cheap. This is reckoned the be&s;t place in all <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> for River-fi&s;h, e&s;pecially Pikes and Perch, Salmon they have in great abundance, as al&s;o Carp, Bream, and Sturgeon, with other kinds not commonly found in the <HI>Low-Countreys.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Novogorod</HI> (which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>New-town,</HI> or <HI>Newton,</HI> being compounded of the Latin word <HI>Novus,</HI> and the &s;ub&s;tantive <HI>Gorod,</HI> in the <HI>Mo&s;covian</HI> Tongue, a City) is at this pre&s;ent &s;trengthned only with a Wall of Timber, but well provided with Ammunition, and Bra&s;s Ordnance. On the one &s;ide is a &s;trong Ca&s;tle with a high &s;tone-wall, which as then was the Re&s;iding place of the Primate or Arch-bi&s;hop of the We&s;t-Province, and &s;ome other Temporal Lords. The greate&s;t Decorum and Ornament of this City is the Pomp and &s;tateline&s;s of the Churches and &s;ome Public Edifices, as at <HI>Pletskou,</HI> but the Hou&s;es and Private Dwellings of the Inhabitants without any Order or neatne&s;s of Structure. Between the Ca&s;tle and the Town is a long wooden Bridge where the beforenamcd <HI>Ivan Ba&s;ilowitz,</HI> a great Tyrant, threw in &s;ome Thou&s;ands of the Inhabitants. When you enter the Town, by that way you come within view of a famous Cloy&s;ter, dedicate to Saint <HI>Anthony: which Saint they beleeve and will per&s;wade you came driving on from</HI> Rome, <HI>out at the</HI> Tyber, <HI>through the</HI> Aegean <HI>Sea, the</HI> Propontis, <HI>the</HI> Negropont, <HI>the</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which is a Lake and has no com|munion with any other Sea.</NOTE> Mare Ca&s;pium, <HI>and &s;o up the</HI> Wolga <HI>to</HI> Novogorod <HI>upon a Mil&s;tone: where he met with a com|pany of Fishers, with whom he covenanted for a certain &s;ome of Money, that the fir&s;t thing they took should be his. The Fishers drew their Net, and brought up a Che&s;t, which was full of Money, be&s;ides a Gho&s;tly Attire, and &s;ome Books, VVith the money he built there a Chappel where he lies interred, and (as they tell us) his Body is yet to be &s;een, fresh and undecay'd, by which many miracles have been done, but none can &s;ee him, or them, but &s;uch as are of their own Faith.</HI> And &s;o much of a floating Mil-&s;tone.</P>
<P>In the year 1611 this City was be&s;ieged and taken in by <HI>I. de la Gardie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Novogo|rod</HI> taken in by the <HI>Swede.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Swedish</HI> General, and in the year 1613 redelivered to the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> upon Articles of Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="84"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>NOV.</HI> 1668.</NOTE>Upon the 8 of <HI>November</HI> we left <HI>Novogorod,</HI> having had time enough to view every Remarkable that was worthy of &s;ight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depar|ture from <HI>Novogo|rod.</HI></NOTE> and about 2 a clock in the afternoon arrived at a village called <HI>Bruynitz</HI> where we &s;tay'd, and took up our Lodging for that night. The next Morning we took fre&s;h Hor&s;es, but the &s;now was &s;o melted with the Sun that we were fain to take Waggons, and leave the Sledges: but the way was &s;o miry, that we had much ado to get the Hor&s;es through, for the Earth there is of a tough clay. About 8 in the Evening we came to <HI>Miedna,</HI> which is a poor Village, and could hardly affoard us Hous-room for that night.</P>
<P>On the 10^t^h^. we had bad travailing way, being for the mo&s;t part mar&s;hy and full of Boggs, with Planks and trees laid over to make them pa&s;&s;able, which totered and shaked &s;o that our Waggons were often out of order, but were as often mended by the Pe&s;ants who by continual u&s;e are very expert at it. By the way we &s;aw abundance of Squirrels and Foxes which run together in Troups, yet &s;o &s;hy that we could not come within mu&s;quet-&s;hot of them.

We replied, that we were <HI>Dutch</HI> and &s;ervants to the Emperour. They hearing that, were in a doubt whether they &s;hould plunder us, or not; but at la&s;t rode off and bad us adieu. It was our opinion that they were affraid that our Company was &s;trong|er, and that the re&s;t followed us, for they were better arm'd and mounted than we, be&s;ides the Waggons we had to take care of, or otherwi&s;e in all probability they would not have neglected &s;uch a fair booty, that being, as we were told by the Waggoners, one of the mo&s;t dangerous places in all the Countrey. That night we took our re&s;t at <HI>Iazel-Bitza,</HI> being very bad and &s;nowy weather.</P>
<P>On the 12 <HI>ditto,</HI> we took in fre&s;h Hor&s;es, and put our Baggage and Moveables into Sledges becau&s;e of the &s;now, pa&s;&s;ing through thick Woods, and a va&s;t Wilderne&s;s, before we came at <HI>Gamzymnagoru</HI> where we were to take up our Lodging.</P>

<P>On the 14^t^h we went through a great Wood where we &s;aw abun|dance of Wolves playing together, which, when we would have taken aim to &s;hoot with our Long Guns, they ran inward and took the Wood.

<P>ON the 22^t^h after we had &s;ufficiently taken breath, we &s;et forth, having fre&s;h Hor&s;es provided us, and &s;o entred a great Wood,

About the Evening we came to <HI>VVuidra Pusk,</HI> where we remained that night, but could not get any Lodging fit to entertain us either for Hou&s;-room or Victuals, this being yet a poorer Village than that of <HI>Miedna.</HI> At this place happened a Quarrel between one of our Company and a <HI>Ru&s;s,</HI> the fir&s;t having taken the others Ax, for that the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> had &s;tole &s;om Tobacco from him: which being made known to the Company, they &s;truck and mi&s;u&s;ed the poor <HI>Ru&s;s,</HI> after an un&s;ufferable manner, which Capt. <HI>Butler</HI> re&s;ented very ill, not willing to give the <HI>Ru&s;sians</HI> any di&s;gu&s;t.

<P>On the 23 by break of Day, we &s;et out and entred another thick Wood. Here they &s;howd us &s;om Graves where they told us, 8 <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants were buried, who had been murthered by Robbers. When we were got thro the Wood we went over a fair Pa&s;ture-ground, and &s;aw divers Boors Hou&s;es by the Way-&s;ide. In the Eve|ning we arrived at <HI>Tor&s;tock,</HI> which we found to be but a &s;mall, yet well-built City, although it appeared greater, from the Number of Towers which we &s;aw, when at a di&s;tance, having above 30 Churches and Chappels within the Walls. Here we unloaded our Sledges and left them, putting our Goods aboard &s;ome &s;mall Shipping that was provided for us, and &s;ayled down the River to <HI>Troetzka Miedna</HI> where we took in &s;om nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions. That night pretty late we came to <HI>Tweer</HI> which is Seated upon the River <HI>VVolga,</HI> which River with many windings and turnings runs to &s;eek the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, into which its di&s;gorges its &s;elf. <HI>Tweer</HI> is &s;omething greater than <HI>Tor&s;tock</HI> and is built on the &s;ide of a Hill from whence it has it's name.

Here we took out our Baggage and laid it again upon Sledges, taking our way through the Woods where we were a&s;&s;ail'd by two <HI>Ru&s;sians</HI> a foot,

To which &s;ome of our Company who could &s;peak the Language, prai'd them not to mole&s;t us, as they tendred their Welfare, and that we had no time to &s;tand di&s;puting, and an&s;wering their impertinent Objections. This not availing, or per&s;wading them to be quiet, but rather made them wor&s;e, for they came clo&s;er and clo&s;er to us: which Capt. <HI>Butler</HI> ob&s;erving fell a ca|ning them, whereupon they retired a litle, as if they would go away, but all on a &s;udden came running in upon us full drive with their Axes, upon which three of our Company levelled their Mu&s;quets, but the Captain forbad to fire, and let the Ma&s;tive loo&s;e upon them. The Ma&s;tive flies directly at one of them, and had him &s;o fa&s;t by the Throat, that we had much ado to get him off: the other &s;eeing his Mate &s;o hard put to it, ran away as fa&s;t as he could, but the Dog being loo&s;e flew after him, and tore off his left ear; and had we not done our indeavour to take him off, had rent him all to pieces.

It is feated between 2 Rivers, to wit <HI>Mo&s;cqua</HI> on the South, and the <HI>Neglina</HI> on the North, which are united behind the Palace.

<P>There are be&s;ides the Imperial Court &s;everal other &s;pacious Palaces for the <HI>Bojars,</HI> or Nobility, as al&s;o for the Spiritual Lords, among&s;t which that of the Patriarch is the mo&s;t magnificent.

In this part of the City dwell likewi&s;e the able&s;t Merchants [<HI>Knee&s;en</HI>] and other Per&s;ons of note, who dwell in &s;tone hou&s;es to pre&s;erve their Goods, if a Fire &s;hould happen.</P>

runs thro the mid&s;t of it. Here is al&s;o a famous Founding-Hou&s;e for ca&s;ting great Bells and Ordnance, as al&s;o the Emperours &s;table.

The&s;e Hou&s;es are made of Square pieces of Timber notch'd and let into each other, which when you have bought you can disjoint and bring it where you li&s;t upon Sledges, that among&s;t many inconveniencies has this one Conveniency, that if a Citizen has his Hou&s;e burn'd he may be every day &s;upplied with a new, which (con&s;idering the old is brought to A&s;hes) may without much co&s;t, be placed where the other &s;tood; whereas on the contrary, we are often forced to &s;tay &s;ometimes a year or more before the Rubbi&s;h be taken away and a convenient Hou&s;e built in lieu of the old. Be&s;ides that conveniency, they have another, which is, that at what time any Hou&s;e happens to take fire, and any probable danger of breaking out, the Neighbours upon timely notice have their Hou&s;es taken in pieces and removed as if they were but Tents.</P>
<P>The fourth and la&s;t Wike is <HI>Strelitza Slowoda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strelitza Slowoda</NOTE> which reaches out toward the South, over the River <HI>Mo&s;cqua,</HI> and towards the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Countrey. Here is the placc where the <HI>Soldate&s;que</HI> are inquarter'd, which they call <HI>Strelitzen,</HI> from whence this Part of <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI> has it's name.

or rather Ovens; made altogether of &s;tone, which &s;ometimes being over heated, or by the negligence of the People, who are great affe|cters of Brandy, is the occa&s;ion of &s;etting their Hou&s;es on fire, as it happened about 6 Weeks before our arrival there, at what time, by the negligence of a poor Woman, happened a mo&s;t dreadfull Con|flagration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Fire in <HI>Mo&s;cou.</HI></NOTE> that reduced about 35 Thou&s;and Hou&s;es to a&s;hes, and that in the be&s;t part of the City, which be&s;ides an incredible lo&s;s of Hou&s;e-furniture, Merchandi&s;e and the like, there were many chil|dren and impotent People killed. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants, who had mo&s;tly their Re&s;idence near the place where the Fire fir&s;t broke out, &s;u&s;tained an incredible lo&s;s. Tis true the Hou&s;es are upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions removed with as much ea&s;e as ours are blown up, but if the Timber be knotty the Sparks and Cinders fly abroad and kindle other Hou&s;es at an incredible di&s;tance, which being covered with dry Planks are not &s;o ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed, The <HI>Czar</HI> upon con&s;ideration of the frequent Fires has appointed a party of the <HI>Strelitzers,</HI> to be quartered in &s;everall places, at a due and convenient di&s;tance from each other throughout the 4 Wards; who are continually to be at hand upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. Now by rea&s;on of the great &s;carcity of Water in <HI>Mo&s;cou,</HI> the fir&s;t thing they lay their hands to, is to disjoynt the Hou&s;es, and therefore for the mo&s;t part are train'd up in that kind of Architecture, to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant again in the rebuilding of the &s;ame, when all danger is &s;uppo&s;ed to be over.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great but miry Streets.</NOTE>The &s;treets of <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI> are very &s;pacious and wide, but in rainy weather &s;o miry, that in walking you are up to the very knees in mud; for which rea&s;on both Men and Women are fain to wear Boots. Al|though 'tis certain that inconvenience might be remedy'd, by paving it with &s;tone, as they do in the <HI>Low-Countreys</HI> and el&s;e where.

But mo&s;t dange|rous it is to travel alone for the many Bea&s;ts of prey which run toge|ther in va&s;t and innumerable Troops; and tho&s;e, when the Earth is covered with Snow, very bold and daring, in&s;omuch that the In|habitants are in continual danger, and are fain to keep their gates barricado'd from tho&s;e cruel Animals, to &s;ecure them&s;elves and their Cattel; nay, it has been often known that they have undermined Hou&s;es in &s;ome parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowl.</NOTE> and devoured whole Families at a time.

<P>THe right <HI>Mo&s;covians,</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;sians</HI> (for the <HI>Tartars</HI> now under Pro|tection of the <HI>Czar</HI> we &s;hall &s;peak of in their due place) are mo&s;tly able, corpulent and big, e&s;pecially of Head, Arms and Legs. The Common &s;ort are very hard by Nature and patient in extremity, &s;el|dom pamper their Bodies with &s;oft lying, when they re&s;t, or delicat Diet when they eat. In &s;ummer they lie upon boards, or at be&s;t upon
<PB N="138" REF="91">
&s;traw, and in Winter on the tops of their Ovens, or Cackels, where Man and Wife, Children and Servants lie all down together, with|out any di&s;tinction at all. Uten&s;ils they have not many, but &s;o many as them&s;elves judge needfull, which are Earthen or Iron Pots, Woo|den Di&s;hes, Brandy-and Metheglin-Cups, which they rarely rince. As for rubbing and &s;couring they are meer &s;trangers to it, as al&s;o to ornaments and Toys, unle&s;s it be a Figure which they call <HI>St. Nicholas,</HI> or perhaps &s;ome other Saint for whom they have &s;ome particular or extraordinary veneration. Slaves they are by nature, and born to &s;ervitude and Bondage, &s;eldom ever a&s;piring &s;o high, as to indeavour to make them&s;elves franc, and yet will be excited to nothing by fair means, or u&s;e diligence about any affair, &s;ave what they are driven to by con&s;traint and blows: and yet &s;o &s;weet this Slavery &s;eems to be to them, that rather than to become free upon the Decea&s;e of their Lords to whom they ow allegiance by nature or o|therwi&s;e, that they will immediatly &s;ell them&s;elves <HI>durante vit&acirc;</HI> to &s;ome other Patron. They are very prone to Theft, yea and to Murther when they think that they can do it clande&s;tinly, or to any advantage, how poor &s;oever it be, which &s;eems to be primordially occa&s;ioned from the Penury of their Lords, who hardly allow them what is re|qui&s;it to &s;upport and &s;u&s;tain human Bodies: as for Brandy and To|bacco they hold it but a venial Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to filch when they can come at it, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trict and &s;evere Laws again&s;t Theft, in the lowe&s;t nature and le&s;t importance.</P>
<P>This only is to be applied to the Vulgar &s;ort, as for tho&s;e of greater Ability and Rank, they &s;pare not for what tends to a voluptuous Life, and indulge their &s;ences, as much or more than is tolerable. Free they are, and indeed generous enough at their Table, e&s;pecially when they treat or welcom Strangers, who are very welcom and re|ceived with all imaginable Urbanity, on Condition, that they ob&s;erve the Countrey fa&s;hion, which is to bring a Pre&s;ent with them, that may countervail more than thrice the value of what is &s;et before them: and this if you forget to bring, you may take my word, they'l forget to make you welcom. The Slaves in <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI> are very hardly dealt with|all and poorly fed, but much harder tho&s;e that are in the open Coun|trey, where their Lords are &s;paring of their Allowance, and therefore connive at their Filching; thinking it falls out at la&s;t to their own
<PB N="137" REF="91">
profit, e&s;pecially if it be any thing of Food.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> feed mo&s;t of Roots, Pul&s;e and Fi&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Diet.</NOTE> u&s;e much Onions and Garlick in their Pottage and al&s;o for &s;auces. Their Bread is mo&s;tly of Cour&s;e Ry. As for Fi&s;h they eat it rather pickled than fre&s;h, which is plentifull in their Markets, and by rea&s;on that wa&s;hing and making clean the &s;hambles is a kind of an Abomination to tho&s;e people, you cannot come within a hundred paces of the Market, unle&s;s you &s;top your no&s;e, &s;o nau&s;eous and hatefull is the &s;mell. Tho&s;e of the grea|te&s;t Rank and ability do in general hold good Tables, but eat mo&s;t Spoon-meat although it were but bread out of Water that Fi&s;h has been boil'd in. <HI>Cavear</HI> is a great Dainty among&s;t them, but not &s;o high in e|&s;teem, there as abroad. When they have drunk more than well agrees with them, &s;o that their &s;tomach be &s;urcharged, they prepare a certain Di&s;h which they call <HI>Pochmelie</HI> made up of cold Beef or Mutton &s;liced very thin, and <HI>Quas: Quas</HI> is a Liquor which they u&s;e as Beer of which it is made, with a Compo&s;ition of Water, Beer-Vinegar, Garlick and Pepper: this <HI>Quas</HI> being &s;o prepared they put their meat into it, and &s;eeth it a litle, which afterwards they eat with Spoons. The poorer &s;ort have a certain Liquor much in u&s;e among them, which they al&s;o call <HI>Quas,</HI> this is made of Water with a litle Bran and Barley-meal, which according to their ability they temper thicker or thinner. The Gentry drink Beer, that there is very &s;trong and heady, but more commonly Metheglin, which they make of the be&s;t Honey, adding Cloves, Cinnamon, Pepper, Galangal, Cardamom and other Spices: This is a very &s;trong and &s;tealing Liquor of it &s;elf; yet they think good to mix it with Brandy to make it more effectual. Brandy which they call <HI>Wina</HI> they covet above all other Liquors, which without any di&s;cretion or noted difference is drunk both by Spiritual and Temporal, Nobles and Plebe&iuml;ans, Men and Women, Young and Old, and that at all times of the Day, before and after Meals; Sometimes to add a medicinal vertue they put a litle Pepper among&s;t it. Nay, &s;o be&s;otted are the Vulgar with Brandy, that in the &s;harpe&s;t Weather, they will not only part with their Caps or Coats for the Reckoning, but likewi&s;e with their Boots, Shirts and Stockings, &s;o that I have &s;een &s;ome of them come mother-naked out of the <HI>Kaback</HI> or Tipling-Hou&s;e. The Common people were formerly &s;o irregular and void of Order that they would drink them&s;elves full,
<PB N="140" REF="92">
and afterwards the men and Women, &s;etting a&s;ide all Reputation and Mode&s;ty commit &s;en&s;ual and bea&s;tly Actions together: This great Di&s;order was lately remedied by the care of the <HI>Czar,</HI> who, by the advice of the Patriarch, put down all the &s;mall Tap-hou&s;es throughout the whole Empire, appointing in every Town and Village one public Hou&s;e, or <HI>Kaback,</HI> which they are to farm of the Emperour him&s;elf. They are very covetous of Tobacco, as has been el&s;ewhere &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding the Tenure of a Decree or Mandate promul|gated about the year 1634, which &s;trictly forbids every per&s;on of what degree or quality he may be, to &s;moke it: which neverthele&s;s is done privately.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ru&s;sians</HI> are generally gro&s;s of Body yet &s;ubtile enough in affairs of Merchandi&s;e which they can manage very well. Their Women are much inclined to Go&s;&s;iping, and bu&s;ie Tatlers, often beat by their Husbands, who &s;ometimes u&s;e them unkindly: upon which they &s;ometimes addre&s;s them&s;elves to Court, where the men once convicted over &s;uch Crimes are &s;ent to <HI>Syberia.</HI> The Emperour con&s;idering the multitude of Complaints of this nature, has ordained that if any Woman makes complaint without &s;ufficient Evidence, that the Man is to be tortured on the Rack, which if he &s;tands out, the Wife is con|demned to exile, her &s;elf, before which Law the Court was dayly troubled with &s;uch like Differences.</P>

This evil cu&s;tome of abu&s;ing one another oftentimes is the occa&s;ion of Quarrels with Strangers to whom it &s;eems a No|velty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habit.</NOTE>The ordinary Habit of the Citizens, is fir&s;t an upper Coat of a dark green, red, brown or violet-colour'd Silk, open before and on the &s;ides, and garni&s;hed with loops, having behind great Capes, almo&s;t like old-fa&s;hioned Cloaks in the <HI>Low-Countreys</HI>: Under that they wear another coat of Say or Silk, with a high and &s;tiff Collar, the&s;e have long &s;leeves which are tied up round with loops and &s;tand Cooks in good &s;tead to remove hot Pots and Cauldrons from the fire: Tho&s;e that have, an intent or de&s;ign to &s;teel or murther, u&s;ually have an iron Bullet, or &s;ome other hard and ponderous thing where|with
<PB N="141" REF="92">
they knock their party down at unawares. Under this they wear yet another Coat which neverthele&s;s is not very clo&s;e, for they affect loo&s;ne&s;s as well in their Habit as in their life. Their &s;hirts they tuft with Silk on the back, as al&s;o the Necks, which the Gentry adorn with Pearls, Gold, Silver, or Precious &s;tones. In Summer the Citizens wear white Felts, in Winter Caps turned with Beaver or &s;ome other Furs, and the <HI>Knee&s;es, Bojars</HI> and other Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t quality Black Fox and Sables. The Habit of the Women is not &s;o much different from that of their Men, as they differ from each other, agree|able to the Quality of the Per&s;on. They wear generally Caps turned with Sables or other Furs but greater than the Mens, &s;et with Pearls and Rubies upon the Crown, under which they let their Hair hang in its full length, the&s;e are tho&s;e of higher Rank and Quality; tho&s;e of meaner Condition have them only turned with red Fox. The Young-women when they grow Marriageable, have their hair knotted up above the crown of the Head in a round ball, but under the age of 10 or 12 years have their Heads all &s;haven, except only two Tufts that hang down on each &s;ide &s;o that they can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from Boys in their Habit, only the Girls are known by the great rings which hang at their Ears. On this manner the Gentry and Citizens are attired, but the Pea&s;antry as poorly as tho&s;e of <HI>Lifeland,</HI> and much after the &s;ame manner. Their Upper-garment is ordinarily of &s;heeps-skins, with a Cap of the &s;ame &s;tuff; their Boots and Shooes are made of the Barks of Trees cunningly plated.</P>
<P>The Women are by nature well proportioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Painting of faces in u&s;e a|mong the Ru&s;sian Women.</NOTE> and fair enough to boot if they did not paint, which they do &s;o botchingly that every one may di&s;cern it. <HI>Spanish</HI> Wool and Tincture of Brazil-wood it &s;eems they do not yet know the u&s;e of, but in&s;tead of that u&s;e Vermi|lion and <HI>Minium,</HI> and for Flake, a dull White-Lead, or Ceru&s;e at be&s;t.</P>
<P>The Reader may ob&s;erve that their manner of Marriages is far different from that in the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Marria|ges.</NOTE> and all <HI>Europe</HI> el&s;ewhere a Young-man having fixed his eie upon &s;ome Maid with whom he could be content to enter into a nuptial &s;tate, he Courts her and Solicits by Friends to make an Overture. A <HI>Ru&s;sian</HI> Youth inclinable to admitt him&s;elf into the conjugal number detects his purpo&s;e and de&s;ire to his Parents, or neare&s;t in Con&s;anguinity, who thereupon
<PB N="124" REF="93">
go about and &s;eek out a Virgin &s;uiting his Degree and Condition, whom having found, they apply them&s;elves to her Parents or Guar|dians, to treat about the &s;ubject; where neither the Young man nor any near Relation of his are to &s;ee the Bride, in &s;um the Purcha&s;e is like a <HI>Pig in a Poke,</HI> for all people of fa&s;hion keep their Daughters chamber'd, &s;etting always an old Woman to look to her, who is as vigilant in her Office, as a Turn-key at <HI>Wood-&s;treet</HI> Counter. And hence it comes that they live in perpetual Jarrs, and contention, when &s;ometimes in hopes of a &s;weet, well-&s;haped, and comely Darling, they are chain'd to a &s;tinking, crooked and deformed Hag. This induces me to a Tale of a young Squire, who thinking him&s;elf old enough to be a man, intimated his Inclinations to a common Broker, or Match-maker, withall conditioning beforehand that he would not come to any conclu&s;ion with the Parents of his Party, till he had by &s;ome means or other got a &s;ight of her Face, which the man pro|mi&s;ed to do; and accordingly goes to an old Couple who had long intreated him to procure a Husband for their Daughter: this &s;aid Couple he acquaints with the bu&s;ine&s;s who no le&s;s joyfull to under|&s;tand it pray'd him to ha&s;ten the Match: now you are to under&s;tand by the way that their daughter had but one eie, which made &s;ome difficulty in the carrying on the matter, by rea&s;on that the Young man would not venture upon the purcha&s;e, unle&s;s he &s;aw what kind of a Bargain he had: However the Broker gives her in&s;tructions, how to behave her &s;elf in pa&s;&s;ing by the Hou&s;e where this Youngman was to be, and bad her look alwaies on one &s;ide, which &s;he did. The young man peeping through a crevi&s;e, &s;aw her have a good half face, a&s;&s;ents to the Articles and Propo&s;itions what&s;oever they &s;hould be, but comming before the Altar, was &s;o concerned that he took an Ax and clove his own head.</P>
<P>They have many quaint Ceremonies about Marriage: tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Rank u&s;e the&s;e following Rites. The Bridegroom and Bride have each of them one to attend them, to prepare and provide all nece&s;&s;aries; the&s;e they call <HI>Swachas.</HI> The day before the Wedding the Brides <HI>Swacha</HI> goes to the Bridegrooms Hou&s;e to provide and furni&s;h the Brides Chamber and Bed with what el&s;e is requi&s;ite, being atten|ded with 60, 80, or perhaps 100 Per&s;ons according to the degree and ability of the Parties. The&s;e all go in their under-cloaths, bearing
<PB N="143" REF="93">
each &s;omething upon their Heads which will be requi&s;ite at the Mar|riage. Having once entred the Chamber &s;he takes the Bed and &s;preads it upon 40 &s;mall Garbs of Ry, which is fir&s;t brought thither by her Husband, together with a great number of litle Barrels, containing &s;everal &s;orts of Grain, &s;et up and down the Room, which perhaps will &s;ignify Fruitfullne&s;s in procreation. The next morning the Bride|groom goes to the Hou&s;e of the Bride accompanied with the Prie&s;t who is to marry them, where they are kindly received by the Friends of the Bride, and invited to &s;it down, and here they have 3 &s;orts of Di&s;hes brought before them, which they neverthele&s;s touch not. Here the Bridegroom is to tarry &s;o long di&s;cour&s;ing with the Friends of the Bride, till &s;he &s;ends a Servant to introduct him into her Chamber, where being come &s;he is brought in, &s;tately apparrel'd, and &s;et by his &s;ide, but he not &s;uffered to look her in the Face, nor &s;he him, and when they cannot withhold their curio&s;ity but offer to look a&s;ide, as longing to &s;ee that dear Vi&s;age, which ever after they may mutually do with more freedom than any other in the World, there is a Flag or Tablet of red Silk &s;et between them, to hinder it. When they are &s;et the Brides <HI>Swacha</HI> plates the Hair of the Bride, and &s;ets a Gold or Silver Coronet upon her Head, richly &s;et with Precious &s;tones and Gems, to which are fixed two long Pendants of Diamonds, or (if it be Per&s;ons of a lower Calibre) of ba&s;er &s;tones, the&s;e hang down to their Brea&s;ts. So &s;oon as the Bride is dre&s;s't, the Bridegrooms <HI>Swacha</HI> likewi&s;e combs his head; upon which all the Women fall a dancing. After they have danc'd a litle, there come in two young men with a Basket of White bread and a great Chee&s;e upon a Barrow, covered with Sables, which is con&s;ecrated by the Prie&s;t and &s;ent to the Church. When this Ceremonie is ended, they bring a great Silver Charger, and &s;et it upon the Table, in which are laid &s;ome pieces of <HI>Atlas,</HI> and <HI>Taf,</HI> with &s;everal Square plates of Silver, as al&s;o a handfull of Hops, Barley and Oats, mixt together: upon that that the <HI>Swacha</HI> ari&s;es and covers the Face of the Bride, and &s;trows the mentioned things out of the Charger among&s;t the Gue&s;ts, when as tho&s;e that are minded may take up the pieces of Silver. When that is done the Parents of the Parties interchange the Rings of the young people.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Ceremonies are ended, the <HI>Swacha</HI> &s;ets the Bride in a
<PB N="144" REF="94">
Riding-&s;ledge which is richly accoutred and &s;et out with Cloth of Gold, and Fringes &s;uitable: The Hor&s;e is al&s;o covered with co&s;tly Trappings and rich Furrs. Then follows the Bridegroom, accom|panied with the Prie&s;t both on Hor&s;e-back; and after them the Friends on both &s;ides. When they enter the Church the Bridegroom takes his Place which is covered with Taffataf, whither al&s;o the Bride is brought. When they are &s;et together there are &s;everal Images of Saints &s;et up before them, upon which the Prie&s;t pronounces a Ble&s;&s;ing: and afterward taking the Bridegroom by the right hand, and the Bride by the left, asks, <HI>Are you content to enter the &s;tate of Ma|trimony together?</HI> The Parties then an&s;wering, <HI>Yea,</HI> the Prie&s;t &s;ings the 128 P&s;alm, which they likewi&s;e mutter out after him. This done the Prie&s;t &s;ets a Garland upon their Head, uttering the&s;e Words, <HI>Increa&s;e and multiply, what GOD joyns together let no man &s;eperate.</HI> Then all the Friends light their Torches, and the Prie&s;t takes a Gla&s;s of Red Wine into his Hand, which he delivers over to the Bridegroom and Bride to drink off, then taking the empty Gla&s;s from them delivers it to the Bridegroom who throws it down and the Bride &s;tamps it with her foot to powder, &s;aying, <HI>So may they fall before our feet, and be crushed to powder, who go about to &s;et us at enmity together.</HI> Upon that the Married Women &s;trow them with Hemp, wi&s;hing them Pro&s;perity and a happy union. The&s;e Ceremonies being ended they return home again after the &s;ame manner that they went to Church. So &s;oon as they have entred the Hou&s;e, the Bridegroom goes and takes his &s;eat at the Table where he receives, and bids all his Gue&s;ts welcom but the Bride is brought directly into her Chamber where the <HI>Swacha</HI> undre&s;&s;es her to the Shift and lays her down upon the bed, The Bride being thus laid &s;ends to call her Bridegroom by two of her Servants with Torches in their Hands. Immediately upon his entring the Chamber&punc; &s;he jumps out of the Bed and puts on a Gown fur'd with Sables, and giving him the hand goes out with him, but her Servants in the mean time put out their Torches by running them into one of the litle Barrels [mentioned in Pag. 142] Thus hand in hand they go to the Table where all the Gue&s;ts &s;it. The fir&s;t Di&s;h which is brought up is a roa&s;ted Pullet, this the Bridegroom him&s;elf is to carve and throws &s;ome part thereof over his Shoulder which the Brides <HI>Swacha</HI> catches in a Napkin, and keeps for a Monument. When the Meal is
<PB N="145" REF="94">
done the Bridegroom takes his Bride by the hand and &s;o leading her to her chamber they go to bed, upon which all are to go out of the Chamber, and the Mu&s;ic which &s;its before the Window expecting Notice of it imediately fall a playing, and upon that a noi&s;e of Trum|petters begin to &s;ound, and &s;ometimes the Kettel-Drums to beat. After they have been about an hour in Bed the <HI>Swachas</HI> come and conduct them to the Bath, where they are both bathed and wa&s;hed with Wine, Water and Metheglin, dulcified with odorous flowers and &s;pices, and, as the cu&s;tome is at <HI>Mo&s;cou,</HI> the Bride pre&s;ents her Bridegroom with a Bathing &s;hirt. After they have bathed they come and accompany their Gue&s;ts, who all the time were merry at Table, in which Humors they continue &s;ometimes a Week, or 10 days, before they depart to their re&s;pective Lodgings.</P>
<P>The foregoing Ceremonies are &s;uch as tho&s;e of the be&s;t rank u&s;e, by which you may perceive more vanity than Rea&s;on in this Folk: However I think we have no great cau&s;e to hi&s;s at them for their folly, &s;ince we have as many in&s;ignificant Rites among&s;t our &s;elves, which are with them equally &s;encele&s;s and as plain puerility, as theirs may be e&s;teemed by us.</P>
<P>But as for the Plebe&iuml;ans and Pe&s;antry theirs is after a different manner. The day before the Marriage is to be &s;olemnized, the Bride|groom &s;ends a Kin&s;man of his own to the Brides Hou&s;e with new ap|parel, a Cap, a pair of boots, a Comb and a Box of painting and other materials for Rigging.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divorce|ment a|mong the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es.</HI></NOTE>If we regard the forementioned Manner of their procuring Wives, without any former &s;ight or conver&s;ation, Rea&s;on will inform us, that they mu&s;t needs live di&s;contented Lives, which oftentimes turn to Divorcement at la&s;t. Divorcements are with them very frequent and tho&s;e obtained upon very ea&s;y terms; for when either partie finds them&s;elves too weak at blows, and not able to repugn the other, 'tis only to &s;have and betake them&s;elves to a Cloy&s;ter, whence they may never be brought out by any legal mean. The Man &s;o going into a Cloy&s;ter is capable of Holy Orders, after a certain Term of years, if he be accordingly qualified. They are al&s;o divorced when either Party is convict of Fornication, and the Offender confined to a Mo|na&s;tery. Barrenne&s;s is al&s;o the Occa&s;ion of Divorcement, upon which the Wife becomes a Nun, and the Husband may marry again within &s;ix Weeks.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who marry again after once Divorced are for ever after excluded the Church, yet may enter the Porch or Gallery, but if they be divorced a &s;econd time and married a third, they are totally Excluded the Church and Congregation.</P>
<P>They have &s;everal &s;uper&s;titious Ceremonies concerning purity, as to the outward, and carry them&s;elves very &s;trictly according to the Traditions of the Church. They hold it not for &s;o hainous a Sin
<PB N="147" REF="95">
to perform the Works of Uncha&s;tity with a Woman, as to do it in pre&s;ence of an Image, or having their Cro&s;s about them, for that they lay off upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, and if it be in the Room where an Image hangs, they draw a Curtain before it, as if they were &s;ure that that Image was an Informer, and one that got Bread and Butter for telling School-tales.</P>
<P>They are very ob&s;erving of their Duty in the great Fa&s;t at which time if any man among them chance to &s;leep, he is forbidden to communicate, during the Term of a year and 9 days. If it be a Prie&s;t he is &s;u&s;pended from Office and Benefice for a whole year; but if a Proponent, he is rendred incapable of taking any &s;acred Function upon him &s;o long as he lives.</P>
<P>They hold it for a Crime unpardonable for a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> to marry with a Stranger, but to commit Adultery with a Heretic-Woman only Ve|nial and pardonable in it's own nature, but if a Woman of that nation become Pro&s;titute to another of a different Opinion to their own, it is not accounted &s;o hainous, by rea&s;on that the Off&s;pring may be educated in their Religion, and con&s;equently tends to the Increa&s;e of the Church, for they have a Maxim contrary to that of <HI>S. Paul, Ne faciamus mala ut eveniant bona,</HI> Let us not do Evil that Good may come of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e external &s;uper&s;titions of purification are the main rea&s;on that every per&s;on that is of any Con&s;iderable Ability, has a Bathing-tub in his Hou&s;e, which in <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are equally made u&s;e of for Purification and Health. They have al&s;o Common Baths in every Town and Village, whither both Men and Women, without any di&s;tinction have recour&s;e; running in and out naked, only &s;ome of the Women for Mode&s;ty &s;ake have a few Bur-dock leaves about their middle, which are fir&s;t dried and afterward laid to &s;teep in Oil of Olives, which afterwards they rub their Bodies with, in the Sweating-tub. They can indure extremity of Heat and Cold to a Miracle, for I have &s;een them run out of the Water, which I could not &s;uffer my finger in, and of a &s;udden over Head and Ears in Snow, where they would lay a quarter or half an Hour and then into the Bath again, that remained &s;calding hot, which if one &s;hould do who is not hardned to it from the very Cradle, he were &s;ure to leave his skin be|hind him. Be&s;ides the &s;everal In&s;tances I have already given you,
<PB N="148" REF="96">
I have &s;een the Children walking over the Ice, without either Boots, Shoes or Stockings, and that in &s;uch piercing cold Weather that we could not go out of Doors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants that have their Re&s;idence at <HI>Mo&s;cou,</HI> have al&s;o (conformable to the manner of the Countrey) their Baths, which they &s;trow with odoriferous Spices and Flowers, and make frequent u&s;e thereof. When they have bathed &s;o long as they think good, they have a Retiring-room in which is a Sweating-tub or Stove, whither they go and rub them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> as they differ from all other Nations as well in Reli|gion as in Habit, &s;o they have &s;everal Cu&s;tomes, Ge&s;tures and Actions proper &s;olely to them&s;elves. Their Shirt they wear above their Breches and tie it above the Wa&s;t with a Girdle, like their upper Garments; When they Whi&s;tle they do it through their Teeth, not with their lips, &s;aying, that in &s;o doing they abu&s;e their true &s;hape in which GOD has formed them: When they are &s;urprized either with Wonder, or a &s;udden Danger, they do not throw back their Head, like the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> nor &s;hrink up their Shoulders, as do the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but throw their Head fir&s;t upon one Shoulder, and then upon another, or perhaps turn it round, as a Fencer flouri&s;hes his Rapier, or an En&s;ign his Colours in token of Victory.</P>
<P>When they pray they do it not upon their knees as we do, thinking that GOD is di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch an irregular po&s;ture: and when they write they never make u&s;e of a Table, altho they have one at their el|bow, but alwaies upon their knees; and what they write is altogether in Rolls, pa&s;ting one &s;heet to another as they write them. Fatne&s;s they hold for a prime token of Beauty, as al&s;o long fore head and eies for which they pull and draw as much as they can to correct nature, which in things of &s;maller moment they &s;eem to abhor and dete&s;t, if a property of other People.</P>

<P>But if our Patient dy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremo|nies and Que&s;tions propoun|ded to the dead.</NOTE> then all the Neighbours and Friends come together to bewail the decea&s;ed asking the Corps, how he came to dy, and for what rea&s;on, for what defect or want, like tho&s;e of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> remembred in my fir&s;t Voyage. I remember that having occa&s;ion to vi&s;it a Countreyman of mine upon a Munday morning I entred the Hou&s;e, where the Ma&s;ter was dead and the Corps laid out, above a &s;core of old Women, were &s;et round about him, and &s;peaking to him as if they expected &s;ome an&s;wer from him; but above all, his Wife began to howl and yell aloud, who in his life time wi&s;hed him a thou&s;and times in Hell, for he behaved him&s;elf very &s;everely towards her. <HI>Oh,</HI> quoth &s;he, <HI>Timminni Do Shinca</HI> [for that was his name] <HI>my Deare&s;t, how ha&s;t thou left me thus? What failing did&s;t thou di&s;cover in me? Did I ever neglect to paint my &s;elf? Have I not brought forth a fair I&s;&s;ue? Had&s;t not thou all things at Command? Metheglin I am &s;ure we had always in plenty, nay, and Brandy too. What then per&s;waded thee to leave me de&s;olate and forlorn, Oh remember the di&s;con&s;olate &s;tate of Widdow-hood and return to the merry World,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e, and many other fooli&s;h expre&s;&s;ions by way of Interrogation, &s;he acco&s;ted him with, which made me at fir&s;t to think that he was not fully dead. So &s;oon as the Party is depar|ted they open the Windows, and &s;et Ba&s;ons of Holy-water, together with &s;everal Di&s;hes of meat be&s;ide the Body, to relieve his Wants on &s;o long and tedious a Journey, as do the <HI>Circas Tartars</HI>; which &s;eems to be the Reliques of Heatheni&s;m, not long &s;ince profe&s;&s;ed in many parts of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> Imediately upon his departure they &s;end Brandy, and Beer, with other Liquors and Pre&s;ents to the Prie&s;t, who is to pray for his Soul. The Body they wa&s;h from Head to foot, as doe the Jews, then winding it in a &s;heet, put it into a Coffin which is hol|lowed out of a Tree, and &s;o carried to Church, where they be&s;prinkle it with holy Water, and perfume it with Incen&s;e; which done they &s;ay Ma&s;s, and with &s;everal Hymns commit it to the Ground.</P>
<P>But if a Per&s;on die without admini&s;tration of the Extreme Unction,

be Murthered, or Frozen to death, or die by any unnatural or vio|lent means, whether ca&s;ual, or thereto condemned to &s;atisfy Ju&s;tice, the Corps is not permitted to enter the Sanctuary, but carryed to a place to that end appointed, which they call <HI>Zemski Precaus,</HI> where it is expo&s;ed to public view, and if it be a per&s;on unknown, is to remain there 3 or 4 days to &s;ee if any will own the Body, which if none come to claim it is immediately carried to another Place without Town, which they call <HI>Boghze Dome,</HI> that is <HI>Gods Hou&s;e,</HI> and there thrown into a great Pit, where &s;ometimes a Hundred or more Bodies lie on a Heap uncovered, till about Mid&s;ummer, at what time, the Prie&s;ts go and cover them, with a few Rites and Ceremonies.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies which are u&s;ed in &s;ome places in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> differ from others. About <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI> the Corps is follow'd by a Train of Gentle|women who are neare&s;t in Con&s;anguinity or Affinity, who with a great Noi&s;e and Howling bewail the early departure of their Friend, then pre&s;ently all are &s;ilent, that not one is &s;o much as heard to whi&s;|per, or give a Sigh, and then on a &s;udden elevate their Voice and yell out like &s;ome of the more bruiti&s;h and &s;avage <HI>Irish.</HI></P>
<P>On each &s;ide the Her&s;e go the Prie&s;ts, Chaplains and Monks, bearing Images, Torches, and a Thurible, or Incen&s;e-pan, which is all the while waved to and again, to expell Evil Gho&s;ts which they believe &s;till haunt the Body of the Decea&s;ed. After the Corps follow the Friends and Acquaintance, without any order, each car|rying a Wax-tapour in the Hand. When they come to the Grave, the Coffin is opened and the Incen&s;e pan &s;wing'd 3 times over the Corps in remembrance of the H. Trinity, and then the Image of that Saint which he in his Life time made choice of for his Patron, is thrown into the Coffin with him, upon which all his Relations come near and take their la&s;t view of him, ki&s;s the Coffin and go back|ward. When the Friends have &s;o taken their leave the Prie&s;t delivers him a Letter &s;uper&s;cribed to Saint <HI>Nicholas,</HI> containing a hearty recommendation of the Decea&s;ed. A copy of one of the&s;e came once to my hand which before I had Tran&s;cribed it out, was taken from me by a Prie&s;t being the Brother of the Gentleman who lent it me, for it is not lawfull for a <HI>Ru&s;sian</HI> him&s;elfe to know the Contents, much le&s;s for a Heretic. The Paraphra&s;e of the Fragment was after this Manner,

<P>This fragment is all I can give you of the Letter, which as I told you was taken from me. The body being interred they return home, where they junket and drink till they forget their Sorrow.

<P>THe <HI>Mo&s;covians</HI> are profe&s;&s;edly Chri&s;tians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Religion and Church-Govern|ment of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;i|ans.</HI></NOTE> but tainted with many &s;uper&s;titious Ceremonies about Imagery and other Relicts of Gentili&s;m; which the good Emperour <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> about the year 989. rooted out of his Empire, baptizing him&s;elf, and cau&s;ing all his Subjects to do the like. They boa&s;t mainly of their Continuance and Conformity with the Primitive Church, which they &s;ay is &s;till the &s;ame in purity without the &s;tains of Innovation, as indeed in many things it &s;eems to be nearer than the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> a&s;well in matter of Faith as Government of the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="98">The Church of <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> has like that of <HI>Rome,</HI> one &s;upreme Head, who is the Patriarch. Under the Patriarch are 4 Metropolitans, 4 Arch-Bi&s;hops, be&s;ides many other Bi&s;hops, Abbots and the Inferior Clergy. The Patriarch is almo&s;t Sovereign in Spiritual Affairs, having an ab&s;olute and immediate power without any appendency on the Temporal Government unle&s;s it be in ca&s;e of inducing Here&s;y, upon which he mu&s;t Submit to a Synod, as in the year 1662, a General Council was called, and the Patriarch &s;ummoned to make his ap|pearance; at what time he was impeached for Innovations, and in|devouring to alienate the pre&s;ent condition of the Church and reform it's Government by dimini&s;hing Image-wor&s;hip, which he held for litle better than Idolatry. After many days &s;itting that Council thought fit to confine him to his Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e, and ordain the Fir&s;t Metropolitan in his room, who was then living when I was at <HI>Mo&s;cou.</HI> The Revenues of the Patriarch, as al&s;o of the Metropolitans, are very great, out of which they are obliged to levy and Maintain an Army of 15000 men, during the time of War.</P>
<P>The Habit of the Patriarch, and the Metropolitans differ but litle. The Patriarch has always a great Cro&s;ier born before him, or a litle one in his hand and &s;ometimes both, this they call a <HI>Po&s;ok.</HI> Mitres they wear only upon Convocations or high A&s;&s;emblies, and upon &s;olemn Occa&s;ions. Abroad they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a high Cap, flat at top like the <HI>Switzers,</HI> or Yeomen of the Guard. Next their Bodie they wear a Ca&s;&s;oc, and above that a long Gown or rather a Pall, which is born up by two Gentlemen. The Inferior Clergy and Prie&s;ts wear a Cap but not &s;o high as that of the Superiors. This Cap is given them when they are ordained by the Bi&s;hops, at what time they &s;have their Heads, and &s;uffer it to grow no more, &s;ave in two litle tufts ju&s;t above their ears.</P>
<P>There is a Law among them that who&s;oever beats one of tho&s;e Clerks &s;o, that his cap fall to the ground, he is liable to a very &s;evere pe|nalty (if I well remember to loo&s;e his hand) which neverthele&s;s happens frequently in the <HI>Cabac</HI>: but to prevent the wor&s;t when a Lay|man is minded to beat one of tho&s;e Mu&s;hrooms, he fir&s;t takes off his Cap and then trounces him off &s;o long as he will, which done he &s;ets the Cap upon the right Block again.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="98">The Clergy are not forbidden Marriage, nor none that &s;erve at the Altar, but on the contrary are obliged to marry, and that only once,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Marriage of the Clergy.</NOTE> gathering that from the Saying of S. <HI>Paul. A Bishop ought to be the Husband of one Wife.</HI> Nor is it lawfull for him to marry a Widow. If a Prie&s;ts wife come to die before him, he is not only injoyned by the Church to remain a Widdower, but al&s;o to leave the Altar, yet not wholly to lay down the Prie&s;tly Function, for he may &s;it in the Chore or Chauntry and a&s;&s;i&s;t at Mattins and Ve&s;pers, as al&s;o at Admini|&s;tration of the Sacraments, as far as it is done without the Verge of the Altar. For this rea&s;on the Prie&s;ts are be&s;t matched, as u&s;ually making much of their Wives, and treating them more gently than the La&iuml;ty generally do, le&s;t by hard u&s;age they &s;hould drive them into melancholy, and con&s;equently &s;end them too early out of the World, which &s;ends them as &s;uddenly from the Altar.</P>
<P>Bapti&s;m they hold forth as a Sacrament very nece&s;&s;ary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Bap|ti&s;m.</NOTE> for which rea&s;on they make as litle delay as may be between the Womb and the Font. If they fear the Child be weak they have it Baptized at home, but never in the &s;ame Room where it is born, for that they hold un|clean. The Con&s;pon&s;ors or God-fathers being come to the Church Porch, the Prie&s;t meets them and repeats the Benediction. The Godfathers deliver 9 Wax-candles to the Prie&s;t, which he places round about the Font afterwards turning about toward the Ea&s;t mutters out a Ver&s;icle or two, then taking the Incens-pan goes round about the Font, which done he &s;ings a P&s;alm or Hymn, making a brief Oraizon, and after that demands the name of the Infant which is delivered him in writing. So &s;oon as he has read the Billet, askes, whether the Child beleeves in the Sacred Trinity? and, Whether he utterly For&s;ake the Devil, &amp;c. To which they confidently reply in the Affirmative. Then the Prie&s;t pronounces this Adjuration, <HI>Get thee hence, than unclean Spirit, and make way for the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Then he takes the child into his Arms, blowing three times in his Face, and making a cro&s;s upon his Head, dips it three times in Water, Saying, <HI>I baptize thee in the Name of the</HI> FATHER, <HI>and of the</HI> SON, <HI>and of the</HI> HOLY GHOST. Having thus plunged the Infant, he puts &s;ome Salt into it's mouth, anointing the Fore head, Brea&s;t and Hands with con&s;ecrated Oil, and then draws a clean white &s;hirt over it's Body, which done he &s;aith, <HI>Now thou art clean&s;ed from thy Sins.</HI> La&s;t

of all he hangs a Cro&s;s about it's neck of Gold, Silver, Tin, or Ivory, with the Image of &s;ome Saint, to who&s;e Patronage he is &s;pe|cially committed and commended, and &s;o the Sum of this Sacrament is performed. The Water is thrown away into a Cave of the Earth, becau&s;e it is impure. If any Per&s;on be &s;o far be&s;otted, as to become a Pro&s;elyte and embrace their Religion, he mu&s;t renounce his former Bapti&s;m, and be rebaptized after their manner, fir&s;t &s;pitting 3 times over his &s;houlder in token of Abhorrency of his former Errors.</P>

In his right Hand was a Cro&s;s of Gold &s;et with Diamonds and precious &s;tones, with which he &s;igned the Multitude that came thronging to him with great Reverence and Devotion. He &s;at cro&s;s over the Hor&s;e, which Hor&s;e was &s;et out with &s;plendid Trappings and richly Cappari&s;on'd, after the manner of an A&s;s.

<P>On the 12 we &s;et Sail from <HI>Dydenof</HI> which was the Wharf where the Ship <HI>Eagle</HI> was built,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>MARC.</HI> 1669.</NOTE> conducted by the Col. <HI>Boekhoven</HI> about 2 leagues downward. The &s;ame day in the Afternoon we came to a Town called <HI>Nicholo,</HI> where we found provi&s;ion incredibly cheap.

<P>On the 13 we came to <HI>Omula,</HI> which is a Village about 40 [<HI>English</HI>] Leagues from <HI>Dydenof.</HI> After two days Sailing we came to <HI>Pere&s;laf,</HI> which is a &s;mall City, rebuilt, as I have been told out of the Ruins of <HI>Re&s;anski,</HI> which formerly was a famous Town, &s;urprized by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> demoli&s;hed, and the Inhabitants, removed to <HI>Pere&s;laf.</HI></P>
<P>On the 17 we came clo&s;e to <HI>Re&s;anski</HI> where we viewed the Ruins of the City, which te&s;tified the former Greatne&s;s and Strength of the Town.

<P>On the 18 we &s;aw many goodly Towns and Religious Hou&s;es, and at night arrived at <HI>Novo&s;olki,</HI> a Place &s;olely belonging to the Arch-Bi&s;hop. Here we bought provi&s;ion, and all kinds of Refre&s;h|ments

that the place affoarded, finding all things very cheap and good: and from hence we &s;ailed away pa&s;&s;ing <HI>by Schilko, Tericho, Tinersho Slavada, Koponaw</HI> and other fair Towns.</P>
<P>On the 22 we came to <HI>Ka&s;&s;ienie-gorod,</HI> a beautifull litle City, and the Re&s;idence of Prince <HI>Reskitski.</HI> Our Captain and Ma&s;ter intended to vi&s;it the &s;aid Prince, and for that end came here to Anchor, but coming a &s;hoar under&s;tood that he was departed for <HI>Mo&s;cou,</HI> with the old Prince&s;s his Mother. However they went to view the Palace, and were magnificently entertained by the &s;teward, of whom after the Exchange of &s;ome Rarities on both &s;ides, by way of Pre&s;ents, they took their leaves. <HI>Ka&s;sieme-gorod</HI> has been formerly a Hold of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but the pre&s;ent Prince at the age of 12 years &s;urrendred it up to the great Duke of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> whom he as then obtained to be his Protector.</P>
<P>On the 23 we &s;ailed pa&s;t many fair Villages, Churches, Mona|&s;teries and other Hou&s;es built for Religious u&s;es, coming the next morning to anchor before <HI>Leshi,</HI> which is a very great Town, but not walled.</P>
<P>On the 24 we came before <HI>Moruma,</HI> a Town inhabited partly by <HI>Ru&s;ses</HI> and partly by <HI>Mordwin-Tartars</HI> who&s;e Countrey begins here, al|though both the City <HI>Moruma</HI> and the Circumjacient Land-&s;hip is at pre&s;ent under &s;ubjection of his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>On the 27 we &s;ailed by <HI>Prewas Palo</HI> and &s;ome other le&s;&s;er Towns. Near this Place are two Rivers which vent them&s;elves into the <HI>Wolga,</HI> the one called <HI>Mor&s;na Reka</HI> on the &s;tarboard-, and the other <HI>Kle&s;na</HI> on the larboard-&s;ide in &s;ailing downward, which la&s;t comes from the City <HI>VVolodomur.</HI> The Bank on the one &s;ide is very high Land, and &s;teep, yet above level and fair Land; but to the Northward the Bank is level with the Water, and the Land woody and de&s;ert, nether inhabited nor tilled to any purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 28 we &s;ailed pa&s;t <HI>Isbuilets,</HI> and <HI>Troitska,</HI> dropping anchor before <HI>Slowoda.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Storm.</NOTE>On the 24 we &s;et Sail and came that day before <HI>Dudwina,</HI> where we were forced to remain 4 days and 4 nights, by rea&s;on of the tem|pe&s;tuous weather.</P>

About 2 [<HI>English</HI>] miles without the City live more Inhabitants than within, being <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> but in &s;ubjection to the great Duke. The <HI>Germans</HI> had formerly built two Churches here, one for the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and another for the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> both which went to decay upon their leaving the Town. It is here very cheap living, and all things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance of Human Bodies may be procured at ea&s;y Rates. The Pa&s;tures abound with Cattel the Villages with Poultry, the Woods with Veni&s;on, the Rivers with Fi&s;h, and the Land with Corn, Fruit, Roots and Plants. Butter we bought there for 10 <HI>gl.</HI> the 100 <HI>lb.</HI> [which is after the rate of 2^d <HI>per</HI> pound] and yet we e&s;teemed that the deare&s;t Purcha&s;e we bought there. We bought there a good &s;ort of Linnen for 2 <HI>&s;tivers</HI> the Ell, which &s;erved us well for &s;hirting and other u&s;es aboard the Ship. And by rea&s;on of the Cheapne&s;s of Provi&s;ion and all nece&s;&s;aries, we received here 6 Moneths pay: and becau&s;e that they had here an excellent Ropeyard, the Heads of our Company thought good to leave the Lieutenant <HI>Schack</HI> with our chief Boatswain, to look after &s;ome Ropes which we had given order to be made, as al&s;o to fit us with new Anchors.</P>
<P>On the 21 <HI>dito</HI> we put off from <HI>Ni&s;en</HI> and left the <HI>Wolga.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;crip|tion of the River <HI>Wolga.</HI></NOTE> This is reputed one of the greate&s;t and longe&s;t Rivers in the whole World, taking it's beginning in the highe&s;t Mountains of <HI>Nova-Zembla,</HI> run|ning pa&s;t <HI>Ieri&s;laf,</HI> or <HI>Ieri&s;law, Tweer</HI> and other eminent Cities, whence with many Windings and Turnings it runs through the Land till it come at <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> where it divides it &s;elf into &s;everal Heads like the <HI>Nile,</HI> and &s;o loo&s;es it &s;elf into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, receiving by the way many great and navigable Rivers, and tho&s;e mo&s;tly on the North|ea&s;t &s;ide: from whence by rea&s;on that the River receives it's Water, it is &s;ubject to ri&s;ing and falling, as at <HI>Iune</HI> it is at highe&s;t, and in <HI>Iuly</HI> begins again &s;uddenly to decrea&s;e, in&s;omuch that it is in all places full of Banks and Sand-beds, as hereafter, in the pur&s;uit of my Journal &s;hall more particular and ample mention be made; whereas when it is increa&s;ed to it's heighth, one may &s;ail over &s;everal

I&s;lands. This &s;aid River is in &s;ome places more than 3 [<HI>English</HI>] miles broad, and proving in other places very narrow makeing at each &s;ide of the River a Whirl-pool, which cannot be avoided without great difficulty. The cour&s;e of this River from <HI>Ni&s;en</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> is mo&s;tly Ea&s;t and South-Ea&s;t; but from <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> to <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> and &s;o to the <HI>Mare Hyrcanum,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea altogether South. On each &s;ide the River you have for the mo&s;t part very good Land and many fair Towns, as I have already noted, who&s;e Inhabitants are &s;edulous in their Husbandry, and are well &s;upplyed with the particular Products of all the &s;everal Land&s;hips adjacent on this noble River, as al&s;o with many &s;orts of excellent Fi&s;h.

<P>On the 22 we pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;lands <HI>Tlerinski</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;inski,</HI> but to|wards the Evening were fain to drop anchor, by rea&s;on of the many Sands and Banks.</P>
<P>On the 23 we weighed but found our Anchor fa&s;t among the Roots of the Trees, which co&s;t us &s;ome pains to get clear. About mid-day we got the I&s;land <HI>Dioploy,</HI> about 3 in the afternoon <HI>Mu&s;a,</HI> and about the Evening <HI>Kremonsky,</HI> where we anchored.</P>
<P>On the 24 we proceeded forward and got <HI>Parmino,</HI> where we took in Provi&s;ion, which we found very good and of a low Price. From hence we loo&s;ed, and &s;ailed by many plea&s;ant I&s;lands, Towns, and an Excellent pro&s;pect from Land, which was &s;tored with Cattel, fruitful Dales, Woods, Meadows, Currents and what&s;oever natural Delights that may content the heart of Man.</P>
<P>On the 29 <HI>dito</HI> we came to <HI>VVa&s;ili-gorod</HI> a litle Town on the We&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and becau&s;e it was here a level Countrey we tooke the heighth of the <HI>Arctic</HI> Pole, which we found 55 <HI>degr.</HI> and 50 <HI>min.</HI> above the Horizon. This &s;aid Town was then without Gates or Walls, and is built mo&s;tly of wood, &s;ave only Public Edifices, and Religious Hou&s;es, which are there but few, &s;ince it has not been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;ubject to the <HI>Czar,</HI> or great Duke of <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI> On the South-&s;ide of <HI>VVa&s;iligorod,</HI> is a litle River called the <HI>Soura,</HI> which here gu&s;hes out with a violent ru&s;hing and buzzing into the <HI>VVolga.</HI></P>

The former follow altogether Pa&s;turage, the latter Agri|culture, for which they have a happy Land, ble&s;&s;ed with a fertile Soil. The Inhabitants are a rude and barbarous People, utter &s;trangers to good Manners and Learning. They &s;peak for the mo&s;t part the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Language, but &s;ome places there are where they &s;peak <HI>Tartarian,</HI> and in other places they have a peculiar Tongue of their own. They are the mo&s;t &s;tupid Heathens that I have yet &s;een in all my 3 Voyages, have neither Sence nor light of a Divine Power. Hou&s;es of Wor&s;hip, and Prie&s;ts, Re&s;urrection, Heaven and Hell are things they never heard of, nor nor will ever learn to know what they are. However I may not be &s;o general but that I may except &s;ome, who have &s;ome light and knowledge of an immortal God, and &s;uch an one as has the direction of all, but only rules them as a King upon Earth does his Subjects. They are further of Opinion that there are Devils or evil Spirits, who&s;e power is limited and circum&s;cribed, and that they cannot do any mi&s;chief &s;ave only in this Life, for the&s;e doubt much about the Re&s;urrection, and for this end they do Sacrifices to them as do the <HI>Madaga&s;cars</HI> that they &s;hould do them no harm. They tell you of a &s;trange Water by the means whereof the Prince of the Devils comes in horrible and mo&s;t ugly &s;hapes, for which they dread, as Children do Bugbears they never &s;aw. To that Immortal Deity and divine E&s;&s;ence they offer up all manner of Bea&s;ts as Oxen, Hor&s;es, and Sheep, which when they do, they take the Hide and &s;tretch it out upon a Rack made on purpo&s;e, making thereby a Fire, over which they hang the Fle&s;h to boil, When it has &s;eethed long enough, they take out a Bowl of the Pottage in the one hand, and a Bowl of Me|theglin in the other, and throw them both upon the Hide, upon which it falls into the Fire, &s;aying, <HI>Accept, O God, this Offering at my Hands, and be plea&s;ed to hear my Praiers</HI>; which Praiers do commonly import their own Health, or the increa&s;e of their Cattel. So that their main Opinion about that God, is only that he is a good-natur'd and bene|volent-Lord, and the Devil malevolent, which is all that may be gathered from them.

Ceremonies about the Dead I could never perceive any, &s;ave only that when any eminent Man among them comes to dy they make a Fea&s;t of Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, at which all the neare&s;t Relations are pre&s;ent, and the Corps given to a ravenous Bea&s;t called <HI>Brigga|chol,</HI> which I have not el&s;ewhere &s;een: That done they hang up his Ve&s;tments upon a Tree in memory of him, as we do E&s;cutcheons, and this was all I could learn of my &s;elf, or from the Ob&s;ervations of others that had been longer and further within Land. Their Habit is as cour&s;e as their Breeding, mo&s;tly of Skins or a kind of Canvas. Their Upper-coat comes down only to the Thighs, and their Breeches and Stockings all one. Tho&s;e that are married &s;have their Heads, but whil&s;t &s;ingle they let their hair grow, but all in one Tuft, which they commonly ty up in a ball above their head, or plate it, as our Jockies do their Hor&s;e-tails. The Women wear al&s;o cour&s;e Garments having their faces muffled up to the eies: but more quaint is the Habit of a Young-woman ready to marry, who be&s;ides other od accoutre|ments wears a piece of Wood, &s;haped like a horn directly upon her Fore-head, about an Ell in length, and at the &s;mall end a litle Bell. Circumci&s;ion they have not yet learn'd from the <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Iews,</HI> nor yet Bapti&s;m from the Chri&s;tians; but have &s;ome few Ceremonies about the naming of their Children, which is done when they are about half a year old. Polygamy is in u&s;e among them, and that without any order or regard to nearne&s;s in Blood, for it has been well known that the Father takes the Daughter and &s;o procreates I&s;&s;ue, and the Son the Mother, after the manner of the <HI>Cingaleezes</HI> in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> where the Father about marrying his daughter out, be|reaves her of her Virginity, &s;aying, <HI>Should I plant a Tree and not enjoy the Fir&s;t-fruits my &s;elf?</HI></P>

We &s;ailed that day pa&s;t <HI>Sundir,</HI> a hand&s;ome litle Town, and dropp'd anchor before <HI>Cok&s;chaga</HI>: loo&s;ing thence we were fain to ca&s;t out our Fore-anchor to hale over a Foord, which was 10 <HI>Dutch</HI> leagues long, and found work enough to bring the Ve&s;&s;el over, however after much pains taken we gaind the Deep, without any damage to the Ship.</P>
<P>On the 4 we came pa&s;t the Shallow places, and before <HI>VVolofka</HI> were fa&s;t again, where we were fain to ca&s;t anchor and wind our &s;elves off. At night we lay before <HI>Swiatkhi,</HI> which is a fortify'd Town, having many fair Churches and Mona&s;teries within walls.</P>
<P>On the 5 we weighed anchor and &s;et Sail, having a brisk Gale, which in 3 hours time, or le&s;s brought us before the River <HI>Ca&s;anka,</HI> from which River the City and Kingdom of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> have their name, here we came to anchor where &s;ome &s;mall Shipping belonging to that place, aiming to enter the River, ran again&s;t our Bow and &s;ome fell overboard.</P>
<P>Here about is a very fair Countrey and as fertile as any that ever I have &s;een in all my Life.

The Cittadel is encompa&s;&s;ed with the <HI>Ca&s;anka,</HI> which renders the Water within inexhau&s;tible in time of Siege. The Traffic of this Place is very con&s;iderable, regarding the Countrey it lies in. It is frequented by the <HI>Crim-Tartars,</HI> who bring thither all manner of Mer|chandi&s;e their Land affoards, and not only the vendible Products of the Earth and Cattle, but as orderly their own Children, which they &s;ell at a low rate, a Boy or a Girl of 16 years of age, for the value of 20 Crowns a piece. The City <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> is equally inhabited by <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> and governed by a Deputy, as we have already &s;aid, but the Cittadel kept &s;olely by <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> where no <HI>Tartar</HI> is to come upon pain of Death.

<P>The Countrey of <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> which has been formerly a Kingdom, is of a very wide extent; bounded on the North with <HI>Syberia,</HI> on the Ea&s;t with <HI>Nagaya,</HI> and on the South with the River <HI>VVolga.</HI> This Countrey was formerly very populous and able to bring a great Army to field, as in recorded of their famous Expeditions again&s;t the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI>; but &s;ince depopulated, made wa&s;t and &s;ubdued, by <HI>Ba&s;ilius Ivanowitz,</HI> who overcame the&s;e <HI>Ca&s;an-Tartars</HI> in a very bloody Battail, and after that &s;o notable a Conque&s;t &s;et a Vice-Roy.

The <HI>Czaar</HI> in the mean while being informed by Expre&s;s that the Ho&s;tility kept the Field, had put the Forces under Conduct of the Vice-Roy to flight, and that they approached with a great Body, he levied as great an Army as he could do with &s;o &s;hort war|ning, and ingaged with the <HI>Tartars</HI> in open Field. But the Ho&s;tility increa&s;ing more and more, what with their own Nation, and what with the Malecontents within the <HI>Ru&s;sian</HI> Juri&s;diction, were almo&s;t 15 to 3, and after a &s;hort but very hot Battel the Empe|rour was fain to flee and betake him&s;elf to <HI>Novogorod.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;eeing them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Field, marched forward to <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI> which they attacqued, took in and plundered. However the Cittadel <HI>Cremelena</HI> held &s;toutly forth all the time, without making Propo&s;als or Articles upon which they would &s;eem willing to &s;ur|render it, till at la&s;t finding them&s;elves not in a capacity to hold forth they gave it over, upon very honourable Conditions as to them&s;elves, but di&s;advantageous Terms for the great Duke him&s;elf, and the City of <HI>Mo&s;cou.</HI> Shamefull was this Lo&s;s to the Emperour, and no le&s;s ground of Honour for the Victory to the Ho&s;tility, who now as it were in a moment had regained all their Freedoms which from time to time before they had lo&s;t. Right loath was the <HI>Czar</HI> to give his a&s;&s;ent to the Conclu&s;ions of the Treaty, but was at la&s;t com|pelled to &s;ign it with his own hand, partly for that his <HI>Bojars</HI> and Council pre&s;&s;ed him to it, and partly upon his own con&s;iderations, how that his Countrey in all probability would in ca&s;e he continued refractory be overrun, and he him&s;elf with all his Race be &s;ecluded from the Monarchy.

The General upon this An&s;wer &s;ent him the Original of the prementioned Articles, and &s;o willed him to avoid Blood-&s;hed: but the Governour detained the Me&s;&s;en|gers and kept the Schaedule, re&s;olving to &s;tand out the Siege.

much re&s;embling a &s;heep having Head, Feet and Tail, and what is more worthy of Note, a skin of white &s;hining Hair and &s;oft as Silk. This Skin is held in great e&s;teem by the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> and &s;old for a good price, as I have paid my &s;elf &s;ometimes 5 or 6 <HI>Roebels</HI> and doubled my money when I &s;old it again. One of tho&s;e Skins is to be &s;een at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Swammerdam,</HI> in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> a Gentleman famous for collection of the Rarities of Nature from every place of the World: but that of his he had from a Seaman that had been formerly a Slave in <HI>China,</HI> where coming into a Wood, found of this Fruit, and brought away as many Skins as made him a Coat. The De&s;cription he gave of them, did very much agree with what the Inhabitants of <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> informed me of them. It grows upon a low Stalk about 2 foot and a half high, &s;ome higher, and is &s;upported ju&s;t at the Navel: the Head always hangs down as if it pa&s;tured, or fed, of the Gra&s;s, and when the Gra&s;s decays it peri&s;hes, but this I ever look'd upon as ridiculous, altho the Inha|bitants a&s;&s;everated to me by many Oaths, that they have often out of curio&s;ity made experience of that, by cutting away the Gra&s;s, upon which it in&s;tantly fades away. However what I might further add as to what they &s;ay of this Fruit, and what I my &s;elf beleeve in the won|derfull Operations of a &s;ecret Sympathy in nature, I &s;hall rather keep to my &s;elf, than aver, or impo&s;e upon the Reader, what, I am &s;en&s;ible will be univer&s;ally exploded for a Fable. Certain it is there is nothing which is more coveted by Wolves, than this, and the In|ward parts of it are more congruous with the Anatomy of that Animal, than Mandrakes are with Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nagayan</HI> and <HI>Crim-Tartars</HI> are thick and corpulent, broad|fac'd, and litle-eied. The Eies of the Men are wrinkled like old Wives. Their Beard grows very &s;lovenly, here and there a hair, and &s;have their Heads bare on the Crown; yet the&s;e are not altogether &s;o ougly as the <HI>Calmucs.</HI> Their Habit is altogether as gentile as their Per|&s;ons are comely, their upper ve&s;tment either of a very cour&s;e &s;tuff with every thred as fine as a Tobacco-pipe, or el&s;e of Sheepskins with the Wool-&s;ide outward, their Caps and Ho&s;e of the &s;ame colour, where they wear any, for they u&s;e as litle Rigging as they can. The Wo|men like the <HI>Calmuccers</HI> wear a cour&s;e linnen Coat and round Caps, bulging out like a Helmet. Their Fir&s;tborn Children are generally

dedicated to &s;ome Saint, or other, in token whereof if it be a male, he wears a Ring in his right Ear, but if a Girl in her right No&s;tril.</P>
<P>In the Summer &s;ea&s;on they have no fa&s;t place, but pa&s;ture over all the face of the Countrey as we have &s;aid of the <HI>Calmucs.</HI> When they march they carry their Tents upon high Wagons made on purpo&s;e, and &s;o take their Wives and Children with them, and drive their Cattel before them, their Moveables they &s;et upon Camels, Hor&s;es and &s;ometimes upon Kine. Thus they go up and down all the Sum|mer; and when the Winter approaches pitch together about <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> appearing like a great Army; where they can a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in time of need again&s;t the <HI>Calmucks</HI> their perpetual Enemies, who when the <HI>VVolga</HI> freezes &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ail them: and to the end that they may the better oppo&s;e their &s;aid Enemies in &s;uch ca&s;e, the <HI>VVaywode,</HI> or Governour of <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> provides them Arms, which at the breaking up of the Camp they are to redeliver, and for &s;ecurity &s;end &s;ome of their chief Princes as a Pledge to <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> where they are committed to the Cittadel; and upon their re&s;toring of their Amunition are &s;ur|rendred into their hands again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nagayans</HI> follow the Fi&s;hing-trade, as al&s;o Fowling, Hunting and Pa&s;turing of Cattel, and are reputed the be&s;t Herds-men in the world. Their Kine are generally great, their Sheep very fair and fat, having great Tails like the Rams in <HI>Palae&s;tine,</HI> &s;ome weighing 20 or 30 pound a piece, their no&s;es bending upwards, and their Ears hanging like a Spanial. Their Hor&s;es are but ugly &s;haped, but very durable in running. They have al&s;o &s;ome Camels but not many. Their chief Diet is dried Fi&s;h which they u&s;e in &s;tead of Bread. They have al&s;o a way of making bread of Rice, which they knead in Oil and Honey, and &s;o bake it in Cakes. All kinds of Fle&s;h they eat, ex|cept Swine, holding Hor&s;e-fle&s;h for the be&s;t. Their Drink is Water and Milk, e&s;teeming Mares-milk above all other. They profe&s;s the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, and are of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;ect. The <HI>Czaar</HI> allows them Laws and Judges of their own. They are al&s;o Tribute-free, but in &s;tead of Tribute are to bring &s;everal Thou&s;and men to field upon occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>There are two Nations of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> the <HI>Saporoksky,</HI> and the <HI>Donsky.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two &s;orts of <HI>Co|&s;acks.</HI></NOTE> The former of the&s;e were &s;ometime &s;ubjects to the <HI>Polish</HI> Crown, and keep them&s;elvs about the <HI>Bori&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Kiof,</HI> upon 50 I&s;lands which are environed with that famous River. They call tho&s;e I&s;lands in their own proper Tongue <HI>Porog,</HI> which is as much as to fay Stairs, and therefore are called <HI>Sa-porogsky.</HI> Their work is to watch the Ir|ruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> or other Enemies upon the <HI>Polish</HI> Territories. They are called <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> from the <HI>Slavonian</HI> word <HI>Co&s;a,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay a Spirit, by rea&s;on of their admirable celerity of Mo|tion, being always ready at hand upon occa&s;ion. The <HI>Donski</HI> or <HI>Don-Co&s;aks</HI> are tho&s;e who live upon the famous River <HI>Tanats,</HI> by the Natives called <HI>Don,</HI> and are properly under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Czar,</HI> although more out of their free and voluntary di&s;po&s;ition; for they have been indowed with many Priviledges, as to have their own Princes, Judges and Laws, as al&s;o a General of their Armie whom they them&s;elves Elect.

Of this People la&s;t mentioned was <HI>Stenko Radzin</HI> the famous Rebell
<PB N="184" REF="116">
born, who, as we have &s;aid, &s;o &s;toutly oppo&s;ed the Emperour <HI>Alexius Michailowitz.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t occa&s;ion of this Revolt (as him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed) was to revenge his Brothers death, who was killed by an Eminent Per&s;onage, who&s;e name was <HI>Iurie Alexowitz Dolgeroeky</HI> in the year 1665. The Brother of <HI>Radzin</HI> was at that time in the &s;ervice of the great Duke in the <HI>Polish</HI> Warrs, under the command of the before mentioned <HI>Bojar, Iurie Alexowitz Dolgeroeky,</HI> who commanded in chief: and when the Camp broke up to go into their Garri&s;ons, the young <HI>Radzin</HI> de&s;ired to be di&s;charged with his Men, having done the Emperour very good &s;ervice in that la&s;t Expedition, and that then there was no more occa&s;ion for their Aid: but the General refu&s;ed to let them go, as not having any certain Intelligence that the Ho&s;tility were &s;ent to their Winter-quarters. The <HI>Co&s;aks</HI> were hereat greatly di&s;contented, being Volunteers, and had de&s;erved yet greater Civilities than their Reque&s;t, or than ever they had received from the <HI>Ru&s;sians:</HI> they therefore marched off &s;ilently, led by their Collonel, brother to this &s;aid <HI>Stenko Radzin,</HI> which was &s;o badly re&s;ented by the General, that he took the Collonel, and hanged him. This was the &s;um and ground of his revolting, which prompted him not only to imploy his Wea|pons again&s;t the <HI>Ru&s;sians,</HI> but a&s;well again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1667 he began to commit many In&s;olencies and him&s;elf and all his crew betaking them&s;elves to the <HI>VVolga,</HI> where they took all the &s;mall Shipping they met with, and plundered them, killed and threw over board all the Men, unle&s;s they would admitt them|&s;elves into their Companie: They entred al&s;o all the Towns &s;eated near the River, where they pillaged the Churches and Mona&s;teries. From hence he took his way directly for <HI>Iaik,</HI> which he took in and &s;et a &s;trong Garri&s;on. From hence he marched toward the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea gathering va&s;t multitudes of di&s;contented Per&s;ons, who came upon the noi&s;e of Rebellion from all parts. From the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea he went for the <HI>VVolga</HI> by the way committing many In&s;olencies, plundering and &s;inking all the &s;mall Shipping, wa&s;ting and depopulating of Cities and Villages, and u&s;ing the People very inhumanly if they would not re&s;olve to joyn in that Rebellion. From hence he went to the City <HI>Terku,</HI> and &s;o onwards to the Bounds of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where he al&s;o &s;adly mole&s;ted the Subjects of that King, as well as tho&s;e of the

<HI>Czar.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>AUG.</HI> 1669.</NOTE> The Inhabitants of a &s;mall <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> City hearing of his approa|ching de&s;erted the Town and betook them&s;elves to the Hills and Mountains without the Town, where they though them&s;elves &s;ecure from his violent and tyrannical Actions. <HI>Stenko Radzin</HI> percei|ving that, &s;ent out Emmi&s;&s;aries to &s;ee where they kept them&s;elves, with In&s;tructions, to tell them that his End was not to do any harm to their Per&s;ons or E&s;tates; but only to buy Provi&s;ion for his Money, and therefore willed them to return into the City. The Per&s;ons who were &s;ent did their me&s;&s;age, and the credulous Citizens came down entred their Hou&s;es, and &s;et open their &s;hops, of whom <HI>Radzin</HI> and his followers bought &s;everal Commodities and Nece&s;&s;aries paying them to the utmo&s;t farthing: but had given a token to his Men by &s;etting of his Cap after an unu&s;ual Manner, upon which they were all on a &s;udden to fall upon the Towns-men and ma&s;&s;acre them, which after a mo&s;t barbarous Manner they did, &s;paring neither Man, Wo|man, nor Child.</P>
<P>The <HI>Waywode</HI> of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Ivan Simonowitz Pro&s;o|rofski,</HI> hearing how many places they had de&s;poliated in the Coun|trey of the <HI>Medes</HI> and upon the Borders of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> thought it high time to put him&s;elf in a Po&s;ture of Defence, and &s;uppre&s;s the growing Army of the Malecontents; he in order thereto cau&s;ed all the Ship|ping as well Merchant-men as others to be put into an equippage, and di&s;patches <HI>Simeum Ivanowits Geboof,</HI> who had then the third &s;uffra|ge of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> to find out the <HI>Co&s;acks-Rebells,</HI> and give them battail. This Navy con&s;i&s;ted of 36 <HI>Stroegs,</HI> and about 40000 Men. The Re|bells had already 22 <HI>Stroegs</HI> with a proportionable number of Men, keeping them&s;elves about the I&s;land <HI>Satyry Boggere,</HI> which lies about the Entrance of the <HI>Wolga</HI> into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, where they had &s;et up a Watch-Hou&s;e upon the Top of a high Hill, from whence they could view the whole Countrey round about, as al&s;o the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea and the <HI>VVolga.</HI> This I&s;land lay very commodiou&s;ly for their Ends being all along the Coa&s;t of a high &s;olid Rock, and had only one way to enter it.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> &s;aw the <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> Fleet approach, they put off their Shipping, and betook them&s;elves to flight, &s;o that that Ex|pedition was in vain.

Mea&s;ures deliberated upon either by fair or foul means to &s;uppre&s;s the Rebells.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>IUNE.</HI> 1669.</NOTE> It was not long before the <HI>VVaywod Pro&s;orofski</HI> received Letters from the <HI>Czaar,</HI> with a Pardon for <HI>Stenko Radzin</HI> on condi|tion he would &s;ubmit to the Emperour, and for the future demean him&s;elf as a loyal &s;ubject. The &s;ubtle <HI>Co&s;ack</HI> not expecting &s;o gracious a tender, accepted of the Emperours Grace, being already by Hun|ger and other extremities brought to &s;uch a &s;tate, that he would of his own accord have reque&s;ted it, for they were then put to a &s;hort allowance, and had taken a <HI>Per&s;ian Boes</HI> having &s;ome Hor&s;es aboard that were &s;ent to the <HI>Czaar,</HI> from the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> for a pre&s;ent; the&s;e they took, killed and u&s;ed very &s;paringly, whence it may be gathered in what a mean condition they were. Having thus obtained an a&s;&s;urance of Pardon from the Emperour, they marched forward for <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> where they were very kindly received, and congra|tulated by tho&s;e of the Townsmen, every one of them appearing in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner he could, for they had rifled many Gentle|mens Hou&s;es where they found always Apparrel, Jewels and other Plunder for habit and Ornament. <HI>Stenko Radzi</HI> the Ringleader of that Rout, could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, but by the Honour which was done him, being &s;aluted by the name of <HI>Batske,</HI> Father; and certainly he was a father of many impious Sons. I have &s;een him &s;everal times upon the <HI>Stroegs</HI> and in the City; he is a brave man as to his per&s;on, and well proportioned in his limbs, tall and &s;treight of Body, pock-pitted, but only &s;o as did rather become than di&s;figure him, of a good conduct, but withall &s;evere and cruel, as has been already in&s;tanced. The <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> who were his Followers came dayly into <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> where they &s;old their Booty which was very rich and co&s;tly. The Silk they &s;old for a 3d of the currant value, which was bought up of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants. I bought a Gold-chain of one of them which was almo&s;t a fathom long, and in joynts like a Bracelet, between each piece were precious &s;tones: the price I gave for it was not fully 7 pound <HI>&s;terl.</HI> Shortly after their Arrival Captain <HI>Butler</HI> went to vi&s;it him, taking 2 bottles of Brandy along with him, which he thought might be an acceptable pre&s;ent, &s;ince they had been &s;o long at Sea, and pre&s;ented them to him and his Mi|nion, whom the <HI>Ru&s;sians</HI> called <HI>Devils-whisker</HI> by a Nick-name. When we came to his Tent; and de&s;ired admittance, he &s;ent to know

He forthwith gave order to a Gentleman to conduct us into his Tent where him&s;elf and &s;ome of his Council &s;at, and cau&s;ed us to &s;it down, took our pre&s;ent in good part, and drank the Emperours health. Ano|ther time we went through the Camp where we &s;aw him going aboard a Yacht to diverti&s;e him&s;elf upon the Water, with &s;ome of his Offi|cers: he had with him a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Princes which he had taken, together with her Brother. The Brother he pre&s;ented to the <HI>Waywod</HI> of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> but the Si&s;ter he kept for his Concubine. Being now in the heighth of his Cups, and full of Frolicks, bragged of the many pre&s;ents he had given and received &s;ince his being re&s;tored to the Emperours favour, and on a &s;udden brake out into tho&s;e Extravagant terms, &s;peaking to the <HI>Wolga: VVell,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thou art a noble River, and out of thee have I had &s;o much Gold, Silver and many things of Value. Thou art the &s;ole Father and Mother of Fortune and advancement: but, unthankfull man that I am? I have never offered thee any thing: well now, I am re&s;olved to manife&s;t my grati|tude.</HI> With tho&s;e words he took her into his Arms and threw her into the <HI>VVolga,</HI> with all her rich Habit and Ornaments; her attire was of rich Cloth of Gold, richly &s;et out with Pearls, Diamonds and other precious Stones. The Lady was of an angelical Countenance and a|miable, of a &s;tately carriage of Body, and withall excellently well qualified as to her Parts, being of a &s;ingular wit, and always plea&s;ing in her demeanor towards him, when he was in the heat of fury, and yet at la&s;t became the in&s;tance of his Cruelty. However there is no man &s;o addicted to any one Vice but there are ever more &s;ome &s;parks of vertue. His own outrages as to the &s;in of Adultery he would allow him&s;elf, but would not indulge or di&s;pence with it in others. It hap|pened that a certain Soldier of the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> had been taken in the action with anothers wife: this being made known to <HI>Stenko,</HI> he cau&s;ed them both to be in&s;tantly apprehended, and the man to be thrown into the River with great &s;tones made fa&s;t to his neck and heels: but for the Adultere&s;s he provided another puni&s;hment which was to erect a Pale on the Water &s;ide, and tying her by the feet cau&s;ed her to be &s;o drag'd along the Earth, and from the Tent to the Pale which was almo&s;t 2 [<HI>English</HI>] miles, and there hoi&s;ed up, where &s;he hung 48 Hours before &s;he died, and yet neverthele&s;s the great torment of

which &s;he mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible, all that time &s;he never was heard to &s;hriek or cry out.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the many Robberies and great in&s;olencies they had com|mitted, as well within Land as in Sea-Towns in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as at <HI>Ni&s;abath, Scabaran, Mardore</HI> and <HI>Tacku&s;i</HI> &s;ituated near the famous Hill <HI>Barmach,</HI> from hence they went to <HI>A&s;trabath</HI> and <HI>Bachu</HI> which they &s;urprized took in, and plundered, committing many barbarous actions in ma&s;&s;acring of the Inhabitants and &s;etting the Hou&s;es on fire. Here they found a great Quantity of Wine, which they divided among them&s;elves, and carou&s;ed &s;o long, till they were all be&s;otted and drunk, being about 6000 Men in all. In the mean while the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had drawn down &s;everal Companies, and all on a &s;udden fell on this Rout, and made &s;uch a &s;laughter that the twelfth part, or litle more were left alive and <HI>Stenko</HI> him&s;elf 5 times in danger of being taken. The Remainder betook them&s;elves to the <HI>Stroegs.</HI> This &s;o much weakened them that they were not in a capacity to do any con|&s;iderable damage by land, the more by rea&s;on the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> watched their Coa&s;t with very great vigilancy; as did al&s;o the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> and <HI>Dage&s;tan Tartars,</HI> &s;o that they were con&s;trained for &s;ome time to|gether to keep off at Sea, and keep clo&s;e to Pyracy, where eve|ry one was well warned of them and con&s;equently &s;o cautious that they got but very litle Booty.

<P>By this time the Emperour had got full intelligence of the Tumult of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and of <HI>Radzins</HI> purpo&s;e, together with his barbarous ma&s;&s;acres already committed upon his Subjects, and that he continual|ly depopulated his Countrey, he gave order to levy new Forces, in place of the Old, which were to be &s;ent upon this Expedition, as al&s;o as many <HI>Stroegs</HI> as could on a &s;udden be put in Equippage, for which end the Deputies of the Towns upon the <HI>Wolga</HI> did their utmo&s;t to com|plete a Fleet of 40 Sail.

<P>The Governour in the mean while lo&s;t no courage on his part, and the Gentry and Officers &s;till continued under hopes of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Field Army, and new &s;uccour and Recruits from <HI>Mo&s;cou.</HI> The Deputy therefore cau&s;ed all the Ordnance to be vi&s;ited and laden by the <HI>German</HI> Gunners, and gave orders to furni&s;h them&s;elves with nece&s;&s;ary Ammunition. However we could very well remark, that were the Officers never &s;o &s;edulous, they were never able both to defend them&s;elves from &s;uch a Power without, and be &s;ecure for Mutiny within, of which many Rea&s;ons were given to the <HI>VVaywode,</HI> and he as often forewarned by divers prudent Per&s;ons.

In the mean while the Clouds began to ri&s;e, very thick at South-ea&s;t which we thought did pre&s;age &s;torm, as at la&s;t it broke out into a Thunder, wherefore we were forced to put in at a reedy I&s;land, &s;o long as the Weather continued &s;o boy&s;trous. When the &s;torm was over and the Sky began to clear up, we betook our &s;elves to the Water and directed our cour&s;e to the Southward, where beating along the Coa&s;t we di&s;covered a &s;mall <HI>Cnoots,</HI> or <HI>Tartarian</HI> Boat which came directly again&s;t us and asked whither we intended; we told them, For the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. They then again replied that we were far out of our way, and if we went but a litle further that we would be in danger of being taken by the <HI>Crim-Tartars</HI> and made Slaves. Hereupon &s;ome of our Company pray'd them that they would pilot us down to the mouth of the River, which they promi&s;ed to do, and agreed with us for a Ducat. We took one of tho&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> aboard the Shallop, and kept company a while with the re&s;t.

All along the Coa&s;t we &s;aw abundance of Wild|gee&s;e Pelicans and other Fowl which now and then we be&s;towed a litle powder upon. The &s;trand was all grown over with Reeds, which grow to an incredible heighth, and the Water there we found deeper than off at Sea, in &s;omuch that it were very commodious, in a &s;torm for any &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to &s;helter them&s;elves, dropping anchor a litle without, for the Reeds break of the Winds and the impetuous beatings of the Water. In the afternoon towards the Evening it began to thunder and rain very hard, the Wind was very high at South and by Ea&s;t, and our Cour&s;e lay South and by We&s;t. The Water all the time beat over the Gunhil, and two men forced to heave out with their Backlers, though hardly to any purpo&s;e, for notwith&s;tanding all the pains they took the Shallop was &s;till full, the Tempe&s;t continuing &s;o till 5 in the next morning, at what time it began to grow very calm and moderate, yet not &s;o but that we were driven with a fine fre&s;h Gale. The Water here is fre&s;h and potable, and affoards all manner of Fi&s;h, that u&s;ually breed in fre&s;h Rivers, Pike, Carps, Breams, &amp;c. Be&s;ides Sturgeons, Seals and other crea|tures that will endure both.</P>
<P>On the 15 we lo&s;t the &s;ight of Land, and came about midday into the Bay <HI>Kie&s;elarke,</HI> which is otherwi&s;e called the <HI>Golden Bay</HI> the &s;and whereof &s;hines as fire, and is therefore by &s;ome called <HI>Ki&s;elar&s;che Kolt|hoeh,</HI> which is no other than <HI>Golden Bay.</HI> My curio&s;ity was often to ta&s;t the Water; &s;ometimes I found it la&s;t of Sulfur, &s;ometimes of Saltpeter, and &s;ometimes of an od bitter ta&s;t, whence I collected that this came from the property of the Ground and bottom. The River <HI>Ki&s;elar</HI> is a Branch, or an Arm of the <HI>Bu&s;tro,</HI> ri&s;ing about 8 <HI>Dutch</HI> Leagues above <HI>Terki,</HI> and runs paralel with the <HI>VVolga</HI> about 65 leagues, &s;o disbanding its floods into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. But now we were in a more de&s;perate Condition than ever, partly for that our Shallop was &s;o loaden that we were not a foot above Water, and on the other hand wanted bread, for we had not above 6 or 7 pound among all the Company. The Wind began to grow high and boy&s;trous, and
<PB N="202" REF="128">
towards the Evening we had a very rough Sea, every billow ri&s;ing Mountains high, in&s;omuch that with continual pumping and laving we had much ado to keep the Shallop above Water, working &s;ome times 4 or 5 together, and by taking turns relieved tho&s;e that were wea|ry every hour with fre&s;h men. The next morning we could &s;ee no land, but let all be left to the mercy of GOD.</P>
<P>On the 16 we had a &s;tiff gale, and &s;ailed before the Wind, which furthered us &s;o, that by noon we de&s;cried Land: and &s;oon after got &s;ight of a <HI>Dage&s;tan-Tartar's</HI> Barque, which we made up to, but when we came near it, it was run upon a Bank, and de&s;erted of the Men, which upon our approaching them, jump'd over board. We percei|ving that it was only for us that they left their Ve&s;&s;el; called out to them, and willed them freely to return and that we meant no harm; upon which they came back, and we pray'd them to furni&s;h us with &s;ome bread for our Money, but they told us that they had not enough for their own Voyage however they gave us 6 litle Loaves, for which they would have no money, as al&s;o dried Pears and Plumbs which we thank fully received. This &s;aid Bark was laden with Bales of Silk and bound for <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> which when we under&s;tood we gave them a Caution, and told them that we verily beleeved that by that time <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> was in hand of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and con&s;equently we could not judge it &s;afe for them to proceed on their Journey thither. They thanked us for our Advice, and directed their Cour&s;e for <HI>Terky,</HI> that being al&s;o a good Market.

To be brief their Women are as curious in their Accoutre|ments and adorning of the Body, as they are complete per&s;ons by nature. They are very ambitious and emulating in ornaments, and are well trick'd up with Chains, Bracelets, Rings and other fine things, and tho&s;e both of Gold, Silver, Pearl, Coral, &amp;c. which they become exceeding well. As I have already &s;aid, they are very friendly and familiar with &s;trangers, as appeared by their community with us, when as &s;ome of our men began to tickle and play with them, which they took all in good part, but HE that offered to be bolder paid &s;everely for it.

<P>ON the 19 <HI>ditto,</HI> we &s;et &s;ail and directed our cour&s;e towards the I&s;land <HI>Tzetzien,</HI> which we &s;ailed pa&s;t, and had <HI>Tzierlan</HI> to the lee|ward; having very mi&s;ty weather all the while, which dured 24 hours or more.</P>
<P>The next morning it cleared up, and we got &s;ight of the high <HI>Circas</HI> Mountains, which we aimed at, if po&s;&s;ible to come nearer the &s;hoar, &amp; &s;o to coa&s;t it all along, after we had laboured and lay beating in the Wind about 3 or 4 hours we &s;aw a long neck of Land, which we took for an I&s;land, and indeavouring to &s;ail through a narrow pa&s;&s;age we found our &s;elves in a Quick&s;and, &s;o that we were fain to tack about, having &s;ail'd the whole day in vain, and at the dawning of the day we came into the Channel which was a good &s;andy ground and fit for Anchorage. Here we met with a Bark having about 60 or 70 Men on board, who called to us and prayed us to help them afloat, preten|ding they were aground, and fa&s;t among the &s;ands, which &s;ome of our Company would have done, but the major part were for the Negative, and &s;o over&s;way'd the re&s;t that were willing; for we &s;aw the Ve&s;&s;el jogg too and again very lightly, that we ea&s;ily &s;u&s;pected &s;ome bad de&s;ign, as afterward it appeared, for when they &s;aw us wind about, they made all the Sail they could and pur&s;ued us, till finding that we were very well armed they gave over their chace. The men
<PB N="207" REF="133">
aboard were <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and as we beleeved of <HI>Radzins</HI> Folk.</P>
<P>Finding that they left us we con&s;ulted which way to &s;teer, and re&s;olved to let drive before the Wind. We &s;ounded and found 4 fathom, and came in a &s;hort time clo&s;e by <HI>Zierlan,</HI> which we found to ly in 43 <HI>degr.</HI> 7 <HI>min.</HI> From hence we &s;aw the famous <HI>Ararat,</HI> moun|ting his head far above the <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> which was nearer us. The Land of the I&s;land <HI>Zierlan</HI> is all covered with &s;hells, which &s;eem to be wa&s;h'd over, with high Floods and Inundations, whence I pre&s;ume none will Inhabit it. About evening we put off, and after an hours failing &s;ounded and found we had 6 fathom and a &s;andy ground. When night came we were &s;urprized with a great Tempe&s;t, and the Sea ro&s;e mountains high, in&s;omuch that we expected every moment to go to bottom, and &s;o we were thrown to and again on the tops of the billows. In the morning it began to clear up and the Winds abated &s;om|ething, &s;o that we made a litle &s;ail, and indeavoured to &s;teer towards the High-lands on the <HI>Circas</HI> coa&s;t. After much labour in beating through the Waves, and danger of our lives we got that heighth. We &s;ailed by a <HI>Tartarian</HI> City Seated near the Water between two Hills, and by the way met with a <HI>Mo&s;covian Boes</HI> where the Men aboard had acquaintance with us, having lay with their Ve&s;&s;el aboard our Ship at <HI>A&s;trachan.</HI> The &s;aid Men invited us all to dinner, of Fre&s;h Mutton and Rice, which they fir&s;t parboiled, and afterward &s;tewed with Butter, of which we made a hearty meal. After we had taken our leaves of them, we &s;teered away by the Coa&s;t, and &s;aw many plea&s;ant Valleys and a fruitfull Countrey. When the Evening came on, and we &s;eeing it good weather re&s;olved that night to take our re&s;t, which we had not done for 3 nights together, and to that end drop|ped anchor.</P>
<P>On the 20 we came within 15 Leagues of <HI>Derbent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Da|ge&s;tan-Tartars.</HI> Their Form, Habit and VVay of living.</NOTE> which is the land of the <HI>Dage&s;tan Tartars,</HI> who are &s;o called for that they inhabit the hilly Countrey, the word <HI>Dag</HI> in their tongue &s;ignifying a Mountain. That part of the Countrey which lies toward the Sea is dry and heathy, but within land very fruitfull, as afterward to our &s;orrow we found it.

<P>The next day we weighed anchor and came before the <HI>Tartari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> town <HI>Boynak,</HI> which when we had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by, it began to blow very hard, from the Sea ward, we having then about 16 fathom Water In the mean time the Sea began to grow very rough and hollow that we were forced to run the Shallop immediately a &s;trand for fear of overturning; being then but 5 leagues from <HI>Derbent,</HI> which was the neare&s;t Land.

Having now wrought our &s;elves out we gave our &s;elves over to the mercy of Heaven, letting the Boat drive what way it would, till at la&s;t by a great Sea we were thrown upon the &s;trand, without either lo&s;s of men or Goods, every man packing up what they thought fit to carry along with them. The Goods which belonged to Capt. <HI>Butler</HI> and Mr. <HI>Termund</HI> we buried in the Sand, thinking to &s;end for them upon occa&s;ion by the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> But mo&s;t unhappy proved this our landing here, for no &s;ooner were we come a&s;hoar but we were e&s;pied by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who came and delved up the Goods we had &s;o hidden, and carried it away upon their Hor&s;es to a litle Village hard by, and brought the news of &s;uch an accidental Booty to <HI>Aly Sultan,</HI> their Prince, who came on Hor&s;e back with a guard of Troopers to &s;eek us. Altho by day we hid our &s;elves in the Woods, and by night went forward on our Journey.</P>
<P>Having remained one night in the Woods where we took our re&s;t, Our Company con&s;ulted what was be&s;t to do, whether to march
<PB N="109" REF="134">
forward on our journey or to tarry; It was advi&s;ed by the major part to go, but I was rather de&s;irous to tarry 3 or 4 days longer, till the heat of the pur&s;uit was over, that &s;o thinking when the <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;hould have &s;ought for us a while in vain, they would give us over for lo&s;t. However they were very forward to be going, and rejected my Council. In the mean while <HI>C. Brak</HI> &s;lept with his wife and child at a litle di&s;tance from us, and the re&s;t of the Company would that we &s;hould leave them there, becau&s;e that the Woman and Child were but a cumber to us. So &s;oon as I under&s;tood their intent was to leave them &s;o, I in&s;i&s;ted on the contrary, with words to this effect. <HI>Pray Gentlemen remember your &s;elves; to what end &s;hould you do &s;uch an unworthy act, and leave tho&s;e poor &s;ouls behind us who have neither Money nor means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and mu&s;t in all apparency peri&s;h in a &s;trange place? and then what guilt mu&s;t we have upon our Con&s;ciences? But know this if you indeed re&s;olve, to go and leav'em it is al&s;o my re&s;olution to cry out and make our Fates equal.</HI> When they &s;aw me &s;o zealous and in a hot pa&s;&s;ion, they were con|tented to take them with us. I was the more concerned at it, for his Fathers &s;ake, who when we left our Native Countrey &s;how'd us all imaginable Friend&s;hip, and therefore indeared him the more to me. About half a day we marched with Mu&s;kets and other heavy Armor upon our &s;houlders, be&s;ides our baggage, along the &s;ides of the Mountains, till at la&s;t we came into a Valley where we were e&s;pied by a Company of Troopers, being about 15 or 16. The&s;e made up towards us, and drove harder and harder, till coming near at hand, we began to con&s;ult about the point of Safety, yet could not come to an unanimous Re&s;olution till it was too late: &s;ome were for De|fence, others for yielding, which Advice was thought be&s;t, and approved on by the <HI>major</HI> part; for that we thought if the kind Heavens had given us the Field for that time, yet we were &s;ure that &s;ome mu&s;t loo&s;e their lives, and that they might in the mean time be &s;econded by another fre&s;h Party, who when all was done would take the remainder and u&s;e us the more unkindly for our ob&s;tinacy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They &s;ur|render them&s;el|ves,</NOTE> We therefore upon their approachment freely &s;urrendred our &s;elves into their hands and implored their Mercy after the be&s;t manner, and with all the &s;igns we could. When they had got us into their Power, they drove us into the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Scemkals,</HI> for we were then within the Confines of the <HI>O&s;min.</HI> When they had brought us
<PB N="210" REF="135">
within their own limits, they allighted from their hor&s;es and plun|dered us, yet not with that rigorous u&s;age we feared, for having &s;tript us of our upper Garment they let us go, taking only what we had with us that was thought to be of any value. They took from me a Parcel of rich Silk, which I had bought of the Rebells at <HI>A&s;tra|chan,</HI> but my gold Chain which I had fa&s;tened in the in&s;ide of my Garter they did not find. When they had thus pillaged us, they di|rected us which way to go for our Safety.</P>
<P><HI>Dage&s;tan</HI> is a Countrey &s;ubject to divers Princes and Lords who are independently Sovereign, but the mo&s;t principal Provinces are <HI>Scemkal</HI> and <HI>O&s;min,</HI> already mentioned: and of tho&s;e two, the for|mer is the more eminent, the Government whereof is not heredi|tary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;trange man|ner of electing a Prince.</NOTE> but by lot, which is after this manner.

me fa&s;t to a Tree, &s;hot me with their Arrows, which they had broken off and made &s;tumped on purpo&s;e to urge me to di&s;cover the re&s;t of our Company. But when they could not move me to detect them they continued &s;hooting, that I often wi&s;hed that they would have di&s;patched me, and rid me of that mi&s;ery. The marks and pits remain &s;till in my Body, as I have &s;hown them to many hundreds &s;ince my arrival at home. The&s;e Torments I endured with incredi|ble patience, not willing to detect my Countreymen, Torments, I &s;ay, that none without experience could be able to imagine how great. When they in&s;i&s;ted hard that I &s;hould tell them which way they went, I told them that they went toward the Hilly Countrey, altho I was certain on the contrary for they had determined to go along the Ri|ver, that they might have their &s;helter in the Woods. After they had u&s;ed us &s;o inhumanly and out of hopes of getting any thing from us, they took me and <HI>Els Pleter&s;z,</HI> tied us legg to legg with a &s;mall Iron Chain, and &s;o brought us up to the Prince <HI>O&s;min,</HI> often threat|ning that they would tear us limb from limb, &s;u&s;taining that Opi|nion of us that we were of <HI>Stephen Radzin's</HI> Company, and &s;ent out as Emmi&s;&s;aries on his behalf, and therefore were re&s;olved that his In&s;olencies &s;hould be lay to our charge. When I under&s;tood that their Opinion and Intentions were &s;uch, I was in a great con&s;ter|nation, not that I was affraid of Death (for that was what I chiefly longed for, at that time) but that we were liable to &s;uch a bad Cen|&s;ure, and could not explain our &s;elves &s;o well, as to &s;atisfy them to the contrary: and be&s;ides all that to be kept alive and &s;uffer &s;o many Tortures as they threatned us, to detect what we were utterly ignorant of, and unable to &s;atisfy them in.</P>
<P>When we came to the Princes Palace, they led us thro the Guards that &s;tood on each &s;ide with naked Scimmatars in their hands; the&s;e we expected to be our Executioners, to hew us in pieces, altho after|wards we under&s;tood it was the manner there, when captives are brought before the Prince. So &s;oon as my Companion &s;aw this wofull &s;ight he turned his head about, and &s;tared upon me with a very fright|full look, which I beleeve was the fir&s;t time, and the occa&s;ion of a Frenzy, which he has been often &s;ince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, and I be|leeve (if he be alive) continues with him till this day. Being come before the Prince we threw our &s;elves down at his feet; he thereupon
<PB N="212" REF="136">
a&s;ked us, <HI>Whence we came, and to what end we were come thither?</HI> We an|&s;wered, Dutch, <HI>and fled from</HI> A&s;trachan, <HI>to avoid the</HI> Co&s;acks, <HI>who upon our departure were about to lay &s;iege to that City, and now come to implore your Highne&s;&s;es gracious Protection. All this I hear very well</HI> (quoth the Prince) <HI>but I am certain that you are your &s;elves</HI> Co&s;acs, <HI>and of that Rout which not long ago depopulated my Countrey and made Havoc of my Subjects, and now the Villain, your Ma&s;ter having taken in</HI> A&s;trachan <HI>has &s;ent you as Spies and Explorators to vi&s;it my Towns.</HI> Our reply was, <HI>Sir, we know nothing of the De&s;igns of the</HI> Co&s;acs, <HI>but &s;erved as Marriners in a Ship, which &s;ome of our Countrey-men have built for the Emperour of</HI> Mo&s;covia. When the Prince heard that, he was &s;ome what appea&s;ed, hearing us with more attention, and that we might the better be under&s;tood, he called for &s;ome <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Slaves, who a&s;&s;ured him that we were no <HI>Co&s;aks</HI> but real <HI>Dutch,</HI> for that we had nothing of the <HI>Co&s;ac</HI>-Dialect. Upon this the Prince turned about, and told us our Life was gran|ted us. This news was very welcom to us, but had been more wel|com if we had with one been &s;et at liberty for we were chained &s;eve|rally and &s;ent away to <HI>Mahemet Sultan,</HI> the Princes Son, who&s;e Re|&s;iding place was near mount <HI>Ararath.</HI></P>

<P>ON the 21 <HI>dito,</HI> my Companion and I took our leaves of each other, but not without great &s;adne&s;s, for &s;o &s;oon as we were brought out, and under&s;tood that we were to go two &s;everal ways, I ob&s;erved Tears run down his cheeks, which al&s;o moved me to weep, for that we were out of hopes ever to &s;ee one anothers face again in this World, neither that our Wives or Friends &s;hould ever hear from us
<PB N="213" REF="136">
or that we ever were like to be redeemed by our Friends or Countrey men being in a remote Land. Having thus taken our la&s;t Farewell of each other, I was &s;et upon a Mule, and committed to the Charge of &s;ome Slaves and Renegados, who were to bring me to the Court of Prince <HI>Mahomet,</HI> being about 3 [<HI>Dutch</HI>] miles from <HI>Urwan.</HI></P>
<P>About Evening we came to a Village called <HI>Tzurbag</HI> &s;eated upon a high Mountain, where we took up our lodging for that night. While we &s;tayed here there came abundance of Women to &s;ee me, who wondred that I wore &s;uch long hair, for the Inhabitants of the&s;e Countreys (being <HI>Mahometans</HI>) always &s;have their Heads bare.</P>
<P>On the 22 betimes in the morning we &s;et forward, and went through a great Grove of Fruit-trees, where we &s;aw abundance of wild Swine ma&s;ting of the &s;haken Fruit. The&s;e Fruit trees do not grow naturally of them&s;elves here, for they have an Ordinance among them in that Countrey, That none, of whether Sex it be, &s;hall marry, till they can prove that they have planted a Hundred Trees with their own Hands, &s;o that they begin when they are Children to plant; which having been ob&s;erved for &s;ome Ages, is the rea&s;on that this Wood is grown &s;o wide. There are divers &s;orts of Fruits, as Apples, Pears, Cherries, Figgs, Almonds, Wall|nuts and others, and that in &s;uch abundance that the hundreth part is not con&s;umed or us'd, for none are prohibited to pluck and carry away. There is al&s;o very fair Medow and Arable Ground, the Fields full of Corn, affoarding many delicate and rich Plants, both for Kitchin u&s;e, and Medicinal. Cattel is there both good and plenti|full, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing ours in <HI>Europe</HI> for fatne&s;s, e&s;pecially Kine &amp; Sheep; Goats and Swine, both wild and tame, run together in innumerable Flocks, but incredible is the Plenty of Hens and Pidgeons which are brought in and &s;old for trifles.</P>
<P>On the 30th we arrived at <HI>Urwan,</HI> or <HI>Ervan,</HI> a City &s;ituated under Mount <HI>Ararat,</HI> in the Countrey of the <HI>Medes,</HI> about 65 Leagues from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. The Town is not very wide, but &s;ufficiently munited with &s;trong walls of &s;tone, being about the greatne&s;s of <HI>Alc|maar</HI> in <HI>North-Holland.</HI> There are in it &s;ome <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Mo&s;quees, and Churches, as al&s;o a Cloy&s;ter of <HI>Carmelite</HI> Friars. They u&s;e no kind of Commerce, or Merchandi&s;e, &s;ave that of Slaves, which the
<PB N="214" REF="137">
<HI>Dage&s;tan Tartars</HI> come to buy there, and are there &s;o cheap that a lu&s;ty well-bodied youngman is ordinarily &s;old for ten Crowns, as &s;ome of our Company were &s;old for the &s;ame price. The City <HI>Urwan</HI> is mo&s;tly inhabited by the poorer &s;ort of <HI>Armenians</HI>; but Mount <HI>Ara|rat,</HI> by tho&s;e of the <HI>Romish</HI> Faith, and other Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Ararat</HI> is &s;eated ju&s;t in the parting of <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Media,</HI> and is reckoned under the rank of the <HI>Dage&s;tan</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Moun|tains. The <HI>Armenians</HI> call it <HI>Me&s;sina,</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ians Agri:</HI> It is much higher than either <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> or the famous <HI>Taurus,</HI> or any other Mountain in all <HI>Media, Armenia</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;o far as one can view. It is a blew, and dark-coloured Rock. I have found there a kind of a dark yellow Mineral, very ponderous, and &s;parkling; but could never learn what mettal it would have produced if melted, nor that of a &s;parkling Sand and Du&s;t, which I al&s;o found here, although I brought a proof of each, which I lo&s;t, when we were taken at Sea by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and plundered, as herafter &s;hall be &s;aid at large. This Mountain is for the mo&s;t part barren, and without Earth, and what may be further &s;aid by way of De&s;cription, the Reader will find in the Relation of my A&s;cent towards the Top of it.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ters purpo&s;e was to &s;ell me here, but I could ea&s;ily per|ceive, that they had no great mind to buy me. The &s;ame evening two Carmelite Friars came to me, and a&s;ked, If I was not a Chi|rurgeon, or, if I had any Judgment that way? I replied, No: but not &s;atisfied with the An&s;wer I gave them, they applyed them&s;elves to my Patron, a&s;king him the &s;ame Que&s;tion; the one of them tel|ling him, that a Friend of his had a Rupture, and if I could perform the Cure, they would give him 50 Crowns. My Ma&s;ter hearing &s;uch a tinkling &s;um of Money promi&s;ed, pre&s;s'd very hard upon me to undertake the Work, promi&s;ing upon Condition that I effected the Cure, he would declare me <HI>Franc.</HI> Hereat I was in a great &s;trait, on the one hand incited by the &s;weet hopes of Freedom, and on the other daunted when I thought what a &s;evere penalty I was liable to from the hands of tho&s;e cruel men, if I &s;hould chance to mi&s;carry However I took courage, and con&s;ented to take the Patient in hand tru&s;ting in the good Grace of GOD, and hoping for a lucky &s;ucce&s;s which al&s;o would have come to pa&s;s, by the death of one of us three Thus I undertook the Journey, and was &s;even days before I came

At every 5 Miles end we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">und a Hermitage, where we were &s;upplyed with a Pea&s;ant and an A&s;s, to carry our Provi&s;ion, and Wood for Fewel, becau&s;e that about the midle of the Mountain it is &s;o extreme cold, that Ice of half a nights freezing, will bear man and hor&s;e. In our Journey upwards, we pa&s;&s;ed through three &s;orts of clouds. The fir&s;t were thick, mi&s;ty and dark. The &s;econd were cold and like &s;now, al|though it was then perfect &s;ummer below in the Valleys, and &s;o warm that the Grapes were very early ripe. The third &s;ort were &s;o cold, that we could hardly endure any longer, and thought verily that we &s;hould have grown &s;tiff, and not able to proceed on our Jour|ney. But having now travailed 4 days, and had pa&s;&s;ed through the highe&s;t and colde&s;t clouds, we found the Air very temperate and tolerable. On the 7 of that Moneth, we arrived at the Hermites hou&s;e, which was hewen out of a Rock, the Weather being there &s;o moderate and gentle as man can imagine, or heart can wi&s;h; nei|ther more hot than might very well be endured, nor yet more cold than was expetible and congruous to humane con&s;titution. The &s;un enlivened us with thwarting beams, which were again refracted, with the refre&s;hing gales of Wind; the Wind correcting the Sun, the Sun the Wind. The Hermite told me he had lived there 25 years, and never had &s;een the weather any otherwi&s;e. But on the top of the Hill, it was yet more calm, where as none can remember that the Air there did ever change, or was &s;ubject either to Wind or Rain, which is pre&s;umed to be the rea&s;on that the Ark has endured &s;o long without being rotten.</P>
<P>Going into the Hermites Cell, I took a view of the Rupture, which I &s;aw was &s;hut forth about the bulk of a henns-egg; and with one a&s;ked him, How long he had had it? he an&s;wered, A Moneth: which gave me good encouragement, &s;ince I was &s;ure that the Fi&s;&s;ure was fre&s;h, and therefore the Cure with greater facility to be effected.</P>
<P>Thus I undertook the work, and taking 200 fre&s;h Hen-eggs I boy|led them hard, and made thereof an Unguent. I made al&s;o a Tru&s;s, and anointed him 4 times a day with the Oyntment cau&s;ing him to ly &s;till for a fortnight together, which done I let him ri&s;e up to &s;ee
<PB N="216" REF="140">
how he was, and found that it was &s;ufficiently bettered: for the Rupture which he with his own hands had indeavoured to &s;top, by thru&s;ting it in, and as often broke out, was now &s;tay'd, and he told me that he could every day perceiv that it grew better. I gave him advice to keep him&s;elf a whole year in the Tru&s;s, and continue anoynting him&s;elf after the manner I did my&s;elf, which he al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed to ob&s;erv. When I took my leav of him, he gave me a piece of hard wood, of a dark-red colour, with a Cro&s;s, and a &s;ilver Chain which he wore about his neck, as al&s;o a Stone, which he told me he had taken from under the Ark; The&s;e Relicts he adjured me to be very carefull of, &s;aying the real value and e&s;teem thereof would be &s;uch, that if ever I came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and be&s;towed them on St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church that they would reward me with a Gift which &s;hould &s;erve me for a maintenance &s;o long as I lived. The Wood and the Cro&s;s I brought with me, but the &s;tone, with &s;ome &s;parkling Oar were taken from me when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> took our Ship. The Hermite was born at <HI>Rome,</HI> and of very good Parentage, his Father being one of the mo&s;t eminent Citizens there, who upon his Death-bed charged his Son, To retire him&s;elf from the Society of Men and betake him&s;elf to the Mountain <HI>Ararat,</HI> there to &s;pend his days in a Heremitical Life. The Son in obedience to this his Father's Will, took upon him this Journey and manner of Life, where he had then been 25 years, living there in great Tranquillity and with more contentment than he could do in the World of <HI>Rome.</HI> Be&s;ides tho&s;e Relicts already mentioned he gave me a Te&s;timonial in Writing, to evidence to the Curious my being there, which [<HI>after a Monki&s;h Elegancy</HI>] runs thus:

<P>SO &s;oon as I was arrived at <HI>Urwan</HI> and entred the Hou&s;e of my Patron <HI>Mehemet,</HI> he gave order to &s;ecure me with 2 Chains, for he feared that I would make my e&s;cape, by running into the <HI>Tur|kish</HI> Jurisdiction. One of the&s;e Chains was light and tolerable, but the other very ma&s;&s;y and ponderous, in&s;omuch that to bear the Chain alone, might &s;eem to be Slavery enough. This Condition brought me into a deep Melancholy, even to death, not only that I should be|come a Slave, but that my Patrons Incredulity should be the occa|&s;ion of &s;uch Affliction to me, as al&s;o that he should &s;o much vio|late his Word, when having promi&s;ed to let me go free again, on condition he received that money upon my effecting the Cure, which the Heremite cau&s;ed to be hone&s;tly paid; for had I not tru&s;ted to that his promi&s;e, I should have prevailed with the Heremite &s;o far as to purcha&s;e my liberty, &s;ince the Slave-market is there very low. Be&s;ides all this he continually wrought upon me to renounce Chri|&s;tianity, with many fair Promi&s;es, as, that if I would be Circum|ci&s;ed
<PB N="119" REF="141">
he would give me, two of the faire&s;t Damo&s;els in the Countrey for Wives; but this his proffer I refu&s;ed without making much &s;tu|dy in framing of an An&s;wer, de&s;iring him rather to &s;evere my head from my body, than to urge me to what my Con&s;cience would not di&s;pence with: yet not &s;ati&s;fied with this Reply, he per&s;i&s;ted on, and told me that he would give me &s;o many Acres of Ground, be|&s;ides Orchards and Slaves: yet all he could imagine to per&s;wade me to embrace the <HI>Turkish</HI> Faith, would not move me &s;o much as to give him the le&s;t hopes: in&s;omuch that for that time he broke off without giving me any &s;harp Language. Shortly after he &s;ent 2 fair Girls, who at fir&s;t entrance &s;aluted me very friendly, and begin|ning with a trifling di&s;cour&s;e, they proceeded on to more &s;erious matters, and con&s;equently proffered them&s;elves to me as Wives, making u&s;e of a <HI>Ru&s;sian</HI> Slave to be their Interpreter: and to make their reque&s;t prove the more effectual, they began to &s;troak me, and play a hundred wanton tricks to allure me, which when I perceiv|ed, pray'd them to de&s;i&s;t and not to trouble me any longer, for it was again&s;t my Con&s;cience to violate the Laws of Chri&s;tianity, which forbid Polygamy, having already a Wife by whom I had two Children, and although I were in the mo&s;t remote parts of the World, I &s;hould not alienate my Love and Troth, by mar|rying of another &s;o long as &s;he was alive. To this they made an|&s;wer, That I &s;hould never &s;ee either my own Countrey or Rela|tions again, and that many thou&s;ands would be glad of what was proffered me, and therefore willed me to accept of it, le&s;t I &s;hould afterwards repent when it could not be revoked, &amp;c. After they had u&s;ed a few &s;uch like Arguments they left me. Hardly were they got out but my Patron came in, who fell to work again with greater, and more &s;pecious promi&s;es than before, as. That if I would be|come a <HI>Mu&s;ulman</HI> [or True Beleever] he would advance me to the Dignity of a Commander in the Guards. This perplexed me very much when I &s;aw him &s;o earne&s;t, thinking that if he could not get his will by fair means, he would proceed to rigour, and being ab&s;olute Lord and Soveraign, as well of the Countrey, as of my Per&s;on, would force me to embrace the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, how|ever I had already &s;tood out &s;o much Torture, that being a litle hardned to it I feared it &s;o much the le&s;s: but gave him a &s;hort

An&s;wer; to this Effect, <HI>Sir, All the fair promi&s;es you have already, and that you may hereafter make shall not have that efficacy with me, as to make me renounce my Faith, for I had rather di&s;patch my &s;elf, than to im|brace Mahometanism.</HI> He hearing me &s;ay &s;o did not for that time pre&s;s me much more.</P>
<P>On the 9^t^h^. <HI>dito</HI> I continued &s;till in Chains, at what time the young Damo&s;els that had been with me before, were &s;ent again, who, as they did the la&s;t time, endeavoured to per&s;wade me to turn <HI>Mahometan</HI>; neither did they de&s;i&s;t to u&s;e all manner of Allurements they could devi&s;e, to entice me to ly with them, for &s;o they thought that if I had done that, I mu&s;t either become Turk, or dy a mi|&s;erable Death; They further did what they could to put me in mind of my pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, and told me that I mu&s;t never expect to en|joy any better than what I &s;aw before my eies; and in the conclu|&s;ion of all, told me that they wondred at the Folly and Vanity of the Chri&s;tians who were &s;o &s;trictly tied to Monogamy, or only to marry one Wife, when as the <HI>Mahometans</HI> might have as many as they li&s;ted, or thought them&s;elves capable to maintain.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter altho he was a Prince yet thought it no di&s;honour to trade in Commerce: but the chief thing he had which brought him up the mo&s;t Revenues, were the Baths which he kept; having &s;om almo&s;t in every City, as well in his own Juri&s;diction as in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and other Countreys, whereof tho&s;e were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, at <HI>Derbent,</HI> at <HI>Scamachy,</HI> and at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> which brought him in a va&s;t &s;um of Money yearly.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the Baths are there in &s;uch e&s;teem, and &s;o much frequented by per&s;ons of all Ranks and Degrees, is not on|ly their affected Cleanline&s;s, in which they &s;urpa&s;s all others: but as well thro Super&s;tition: for that after the u&s;e of their Wives, they are to bath, being till then reputed unclean, and may not enter the <HI>Mo&s;ques:</HI> and this both &s;exes are injoyned to upon &s;uch Ca&s;es by the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> A man among them may not ly with his wife from Conception to her Delivery: which is probably in&s;tituted as a Prae|cept in the <HI>Alchoran</HI> to make tho&s;e Countreys more populous; for &s;o one Man is capable of generating many Children in one year. The Baths are frequented from Break of day to the Setting of the Sun. From morning till noon the Men bath, and from noon till night the Women, &s;o taking it by Turns.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="142">On the 10^t^h^. came my Patron to vi&s;it me and asked me how I did, and if I had taken good Courage: I an&s;wered him that I had no great occa&s;ion to thank him for my Welfare, &s;ince he did all he could to make me mi&s;erable, and contrary to that Hone&s;ty and Truth, which the <HI>Turks</HI> boa&s;ted of, he had &s;hown me an odd example: Withall telling him that he had little rea|&s;on to chain me &s;o fa&s;t, and make my Slavery the greater when as he had promi&s;ed me my Freedom, upon the receipt of the Money which was paid him. Upon this he &s;eemed to be a little moved to compa&s;&s;ion and commanded that the greater Chain &s;hould be taken off: Now when I ob&s;erved that my rea|&s;oning had a litle prevalency with him I pur&s;ued on in my Argument, with the&s;e, or the like Words, <HI>Sir, Is it not &s;ufficient that I am your Slave? why then mu&s;t I be kept in Chains, when as o|thers have their liberty? If it be &s;o that you fear I should go from you, Know this, That you can not keep me longer than I li&s;t: for I can at once part with my Life and take leav of this mi&s;erable Bondage, which if you per&s;i&s;t to u&s;e me &s;o inhumanly I am re&s;olved to do.</HI> This I could perceiv wrought in him no &s;mall change, for he was naturally very covetous, and would have lo&s;t the price of a Slave. Be&s;ides that, it is a Maxim of their Law, that if any per&s;on do any way murther him&s;elf, the Hou&s;e is to be accur&s;ed and pulled down to the Ground. My Patron con&s;idering what the I&s;&s;ue of this might be, altho I had not the le&s;t thoughts to lay violent hands upon my &s;elf. he therefore to prevent the wor&s;t &s;old me to one <HI>Had&s;y Mahomet Sala,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr I.

<P>On the 12 <HI>dito,</HI> I went with my new Ma&s;ter to <HI>Derbent,</HI> and &s;ai|led with him &s;everal times over the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea:</HI> his principal dealing

being in <HI>Crap,</HI> which with &s;everal other Roots u&s;ed in Dying, grow there in great abundance. He had al&s;o a &s;mall Bark of his own, wherein he tran&s;ported his own Commodities: This &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el alwayes lay in a Bay about half a League from the City, and thither his Slaves alwaies brought the Wares; for about <HI>Derbent</HI> it is very rocky and un&s;afe for Ve&s;&s;els to lie at Anchor, in ca&s;e of Storm or tempe&s;tuous Weather. But in the &s;aid Bay is very good anchorage, at 6, 7 and 8 Fathom Water, and a clay ground with Shells. The Coa&s;t from <HI>Baynak</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;anderan</HI> is altogether &s;andy, and here and there low land, where appear the Tops of the <HI>Dage&s;tan</HI> Hills: between tho&s;e two Coa&s;ts it is all a long very good anchorage, there being many fair Roads able to receive Ships of a greater burthen than are u&s;ually built for this Sea; there are al&s;o many fair Towns, built for the mo&s;t part at the mouths of Rivers, and have many Ve&s;&s;els and Shipping belonging to them, as well for Traffic and Tran&s;portation of Merchandizes, as for the Fi&s;hing trade: for this Sea is very plentiful of Fi&s;h, and brings up the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> an incredible &s;um of Money yearly, receiving from &s;ome as Toll, and from others as Contribution.

It is my opinion that the&s;e are the Pa&s;|&s;ages whereby this great Lake has a &s;ubterranean communication with the <HI>Euxin,</HI> or &s;om other Sea, for it is well known that it receivs 84 huge Rivers, be&s;ides the <HI>Wolga,</HI> which is reputed the 3^d River of the World for greatne&s;s, and hither do all the Floods of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Rivers ha&s;ten, as it were to their Cen|ter, with an admirable celerity, &s;o that when we &s;ailed we al|ways made a calculation how far we would be carried off in thwarting the &s;tream, and &s;o bore up towards the Coa&s;t, as well for &s;hortning our Cour&s;e, as to avoid the Whirpools, where if any Ve&s;&s;el be brought &s;he mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. The be&s;t and mo&s;t commodious Shipping for this Sea, is a Flat-bottom, from 80 to a hundred Tuns.</P>
<P>Upon a time it happened that my Ma&s;ter and I fell into a

di&s;cour&s;e about Trading and Commerce, making a paralel be|tween their way of merchandizing and ours, where among other Words, I told him <HI>That If I were once again at Liberty, I could make a good Advantage, and did not doubt but that in a short time I should return with a Ship full of</HI> Hollands <HI>Commodities</HI>: upon which he asked me, <HI>If I was &s;o rich then</HI>?

I an&s;wered him in <HI>Italian,</HI> That I was of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> but did not know the Gentleman he named, yet was acquainted with &s;eve|ral there who dealt in Silk. He then entred into a di&s;cour&s;e which was much after this manner:
<Q>That the only way to Trade with <HI>Holland,</HI> was to bring over, Lead, Quick&s;ilver, Cloth, Serges, Says and all kinds of <HI>Low-Countrey</HI> Commodities and Manufa|ctures, which would be very marketable at <HI>Derbent, Scamachy</HI> and <HI>Ardobil</HI> and might produce good profit, &s;o that all the Staple of Silk might be brought to <HI>Holland.</HI> and, That all Goods whate|ver might be more conveniently tran&s;ported over the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and &s;o up the <HI>Wolga,</HI> bringing it down to <HI>Archangel,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Holland</HI>: which would not prove &s;o tedious by far, as to bring it over Land to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where by the way &s;o much Danger and &s;o many Duties were met withall; and then from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to run the Hazard of the <HI>Barbary</HI> Cor&s;airs thro the <HI>Medi|terranean</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Sea: be&s;ides unrea&s;onable Duties that are impo&s;ed by the <HI>Turks,</HI> which probably the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> would not &s;et &s;o high, to draw a Traffic of &s;uch importance thro his Ju|ri&s;diction, &amp;c.

This was the &s;um of all the Di&s;cour&s;e

What concerns the Breadth and Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, as al&s;o its' Scituation, Bays, Rivers, Creeks, I&s;lands, Towns and their di&s;tance of Bearing, they are &s;ufficiently noted in the Card hereto annexed, which I have with great diligence compo&s;ed, part|ly by my own experience and partly by the help of &s;ome <HI>Armeni|an</HI> Marriners, who were well acquainted herewith. Its length which is reckoned from <HI>Wolga</HI> to <HI>A&s;trabath,</HI> North and South is computed to be 129 Leagues, and from <HI>Tarku</HI> to the River <HI>Jemla</HI> which is accounted the Breadth, being Ea&s;t and We&s;t, is about 60 Leagues For 6, 7, 8 and 9 Leagues from the Coa&s;t, the Water is &s;omtime fre&s;h and &s;omtime brakki&s;h, and from 12 to 50 fathom Anchor ground, but the Sea is within fre&s;h and out of &s;ounding. It is al&s;o called the <HI>Hyrcan</HI> and the Salt Sea. It has many Boughts, In|lets, Creeks and Angles: the Bay of <HI>Gilan</HI> tends above 38 Leagues inwards, taking its beginning at the Cape of <HI>Scabaran</HI> and reaches to <HI>Sengar Ha&s;am.</HI> This Sea is environed mo&s;tly on the Ea&s;t and North with a &s;andy and barren ground, having al&s;o many Quarries of Mar|ble and Alaba&s;tre.

This is al&s;o reckoned as a Barrier again&s;t the Irruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> and other Savages, being the only place on all that Coa&s;t for many miles together, where they can come a&s;hoar, for the Shoar is there naturally &s;e|cured with a &s;teep Bank and wholly inacce&s;&s;ible. Wherefore this City is not improperly called <HI>Derbent,</HI> which in their Lan|guage imports as much as <HI>The Kingdoms Key, Der</HI> &s;ignifying a <HI>Key,</HI> and <HI>Bent</HI> a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>Countrey</HI>: and &s;o the City <HI>Gammeron</HI> on the <HI>Indian</HI> Coa&s;t is called <HI>Bender,</HI> which is the &s;ame Word with tran&s;|po&s;ition of the Syllables, and a little variation of the Dialect.</P>
<P>This Town is very &s;trongly munited with a Stone-Wall, and as &s;ome &s;ay, was built by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> who had here his Re&s;idence for &s;om time, alth&ocirc; there doth not any Building re|main of his, &s;ave only the Wall on the South &s;ide, and the For|tre&s;s: but all the Fortifications on the North were built by the famous <HI>Nau&s;chirwan,</HI> King of the <HI>Medes</HI>; having no other Foun|dation than a &s;olid Rock. The Walls both on the North and the South &s;ide are &s;o broad that Hor&s;es and Waggons may ride all along, and the Stones are of a hard rock, brought hither from a Hill not far di&s;tant from the Town, being all equally 6 foot Square. On the Wall of <HI>Alexander</HI> [for it &s;till bears his name] is an oblong Stone having an ancient In&s;cription in old <HI>Syriac</HI> and <HI>Ara|bic</HI> Characters, which none now a days can read.</P>

they are about buying, they pull of their Cloaths and grope them all over as if it were a Swine or a Calf. Be&s;ides their low e&s;teem they have for Slaves as to their Per&s;ons they are very unkind and void of Mercy, &s;o that were it not for the Lo&s;s of &s;o much money very few of tho&s;e wretched caitiffs would die a natural Death; Tho&s;e people being by nature very prone to Anger, and be&s;ides that too jealous to live upon Earth, thinking that if a Slave do but &s;mile or ca&s;t a friendly look toward one of their Wives that &s;omething extraordinary mu&s;t be in the ca&s;e; alth&ocirc; I had never rea&s;on to complain of my Patron for any &s;uch thing: but one that lived in the neighbourhood was much ad|dicted to that inquietude and re&s;tle&s;s humour. The bed where I lay was upon the Top of the hou&s;e for coolne&s;s &s;ake, and could very well &s;ee into my neighbours Court, or Garden, where his Wives walked and played together being undre&s;t. The man &s;aw me &s;everal times and I him; but he not knowing how to prevent it, went and told my Ma&s;ter that I hurled Stones among his Wives, which was not true, for con&s;idering what circum&s;tances I was under and &s;en&s;ible of the Condition of a Slave in tho&s;e Places, it had been a Token of the great|e&s;t imprudence in the World to hazard my &s;elf &s;o far as to offend &s;uch men who were both void of Rea&s;on and had my Life in their hands. My Ma&s;ter told him he did not beleev that I would do any &s;uch thing, <HI>Well,</HI> replies the other, <HI>take your Slave away,</HI> or, <HI>I &s;hall bring him down for you.</HI> Upon this my Patron warned me to take heed of looking down any more, not knowing what might come of it. I was very curious to know what cour&s;e the Infidel would take in hand, to fetch me down, and accordingly went down to the old Place, where I &s;aw &s;e|veral long Hand-guns ready levelled and cock'd, laying out at the Window, which made me in all ha&s;t to turn about and out of the way, but was no &s;ooner turned before I heard him fire, alth&ocirc; it did not the mi&s;chief he hoped and expected.

Upon a time, when the&s;e People lived in the Countrey, it happened that the <HI>Tartars</HI> made an irruption into <HI>Poland,</HI> and among many others carried away my &s;aid Patrone&s;&s;e, being then a Damo&s;el of 12 years old, and &s;old her for a Slave. She was a Gentlewoman of a very fair com|plexion, and a well proportioned Body at that time, for which rea&s;on alone (I &s;uppo&s;e) my Patron bought her and made her his Wife, promoting her &s;hortly after above the re&s;t.</P>

It was no &s;mall cau&s;e of Joy to me that things fell &s;o well out, as that he lived to de|clare the true cau&s;e of this di&s;mal accident: whereas if he had died, 't would certainly have co&s;t me my Life, among tho&s;e brui|ti&s;h, furious and unrea&s;onable People, e&s;pecially in con&s;ideration of of the Condition I was in, not only a Stranger both to their Re|ligion and Manners as well as their Countrey and Per&s;ons, but likewi&s;e a Slave, for who&s;e Death and Slaughter a man is no more accountable than for the &s;lender Value and Market price; whil&s;t on the contrary it fell out that I got the Credit of &s;aving his Life, and his Benevolence ever after for an act of &s;uch merit, having run the jeopardy of my own Per&s;on. So much kindne&s;s he profe&s;&s;ed for me, that he promi&s;ed to take me with him to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> where he &s;aid he would be&s;tow me upon &s;ome of my own Nation.</P>

But the&s;e two fearing that their Living &s;o would co&s;t them too dear, and that one time or another they mu&s;t pay for all, they removed into a <HI>Carwan&s;era,</HI> for &s;o they call an Inn or Tavern, where they took no care for Diet, being well &s;upplied by the continual concour&s;e of people that came thither, as well <HI>Indians</HI> as <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> The <HI>Sultan</HI> al&s;o promi&s;ed to write to the King about the Redemption of the re&s;t of the Captiv Slaves, and as much as in him lay to further the &s;ame. Certain it is he did as kindly for our Countrey men as might be expected from him, when as the Brother of the <HI>Scemkal</HI> came to demand them as Fugitivs, and he refu&s;ed to let them go, for that they were now in <HI>Derbent,</HI> and that the King had under&s;tood how unkindly they had dealt with tho&s;e that were his Allies, and with tho&s;e with
<PB N="233" REF="148">
whom his Subjects had a great corre&s;pondence, as to matter of Commerce: In&s;omuch that <HI>Aly,</HI> the <HI>Tartar,</HI> returned without ob|taining what he came for, and the Slaves they had &s;till were for this rea&s;on more &s;everely u&s;ed than before, and kept with more &s;trictne&s;s, &s;ince by that they were &s;en&s;ible, that if they could but make their e&s;cape to <HI>Derbent</HI> they were protected.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as I under&s;tood that <HI>P. Arents</HI> and <HI>De Vries</HI> were arri|ved at <HI>Derbent</HI> I pray'd my Patron to let me go to vi&s;it them, which he granted. So &s;oon as I came to them, I begun to en|quire of their manner of E&s;caping, and of their pre&s;ent Condi|dition, which they related from the beginning to the end of all. My Patron was al&s;o curious to &s;ee them and came him&s;elf in per|&s;on: Upon which I did bethink my &s;elf of a Stratagem to redeem my Companion <HI>Els Pieter&s;z,</HI> who was &s;till at <HI>Boynak.</HI> I told my Ma|&s;ter then that I had &s;till a Son in the Hands of Prince <HI>O&s;min,</HI> and looking towards the Gunner I gave him a wink with the Eie, that he &s;hould a&s;&s;ert it, which when my Patron asked him he did: he therefore &s;ent to redeem him with intention to keep us both, but the Party &s;ent, who was a <HI>Ru&s;sian</HI> and a <HI>Renegado,</HI> brought us news that he was gone within Land, which &s;adly troubled me: For, had I got him to <HI>Derbent</HI> I could have brought him to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> where there was more apparency and likelyhood of obtaining Liberty than among the ob&s;cure <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>Meanwhile I went dayly to vi&s;it the Gunner and <HI>Peter Arent&s;z,</HI> and once finding them very heartle&s;s and Melancholic I did all I could to comfort them. <HI>How,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>can you be &s;o &s;ad being free, and I who am a Slave &s;till keep a good heart? Be not &s;o dejected, for the</HI> Per&s;ians <HI>will &s;om time or other take you with their</HI> Caravans <HI>to</HI> I&s;pahan, <HI>and &s;o you may get to</HI> Gameron, <HI>and thence be tran&s;ported for the</HI> Indies, <HI>by which means you will be brought home,</HI> &amp;c. They told me al&s;o that the re&s;t of the Company were at liberty and without Chains, that they had al&s;o re&s;olved to flee together, but judged them&s;elvs a&s;well un&s;afe at <HI>Derbent,</HI> which they had intended for their <HI>A&s;ylum,</HI> &s;aying, That they &s;hould come thither &s;oon enough, when they &s;hould be &s;old at the Slave-Market; and certainly they were not much over-bur|thened, for the greate&s;t Task they had was only to hew wood for Fewel and other u&s;es in the Princes Hou&s;e: and if my companion

and I had but had the &s;ame opportunity they had to be unchain'd we &s;hould not have dallied long about a Re&s;olution, whether to &s;tay or betake our &s;elvs to flight, for it was not above 12 [<HI>En|glish</HI>[ miles from <HI>Derbent.</HI> We often contrived to break or file the Chain in &s;under, but the Links were &s;o ma&s;&s;y that we dur&s;t not at|tempt le&s;t we &s;hould not perform it at one time. They were al&s;o taken by the <HI>Dage&s;tan-Tartars,</HI> which are reputed the more mercifull, but we by the <HI>Calmucs,</HI> the one being under the <HI>O&s;min</HI> and the o|ther under the <HI>Scemkal. C. Brak</HI> was &s;old by the <HI>Scemkal</HI> for thr&eacute;e years, after the expiration of which time his <HI>Patron</HI> was to have him again: His Wife whom the Prince had ravi&s;hed, was al&s;o taken from him and made u&s;e by the &s;aid Prince for a Concubine, being attired in Princely Habit, and had much favour &s;hown her. <HI>Brak</HI> therefore intending to make his e&s;cape, intimated his De&s;ign to his Wife; who would by no means a&s;&s;ent to the matter, becau&s;e of her Child, and told him further that if he did offer to go that &s;he would detect the matter to the Prince. To this he replied, that ina&s;much as &s;he was taken from him they were never like to come together again, and that he probably for that rea&s;on &s;hould be carried farther within Land, where he &s;hould be out of all hopes of ever being redeemed; whereas on the contrary if ever he came to <HI>Derbent</HI> that there he &s;hould not only him&s;elf be free, but al&s;o &s;eek a mean to get her redeemed, yet all this was but in vain, for &s;he would not hear of it; in&s;omuch that he was fain to run away without her knowledge; but what then became of him, and whether he was retaken by &s;ome others, or is dead, I could never yet be &s;o happy as to know. As to his Flight, we were well a&s;&s;ured, for his Patron &s;ent to us at <HI>Derbent</HI> to enquire after him, but had a very unwelcom An&s;wer: and the <HI>Sultan,</HI> to hearing that &s;uch a Per&s;on was come to &s;eek for them, gave order to ap|prehend him, and &s;o continued him Captiv till he proved that he only came to &s;eek one that he had bought for ready Money, and was not of Intention to meddle with any body el&s;e; upon which the <HI>Sultan,</HI> ordered him enlargement.</P>

<P>ON the 29 were &s;ent out about 50 Slaves together with &s;ome other free per&s;ons to hew Wood in the Countrey, among&s;t which my Patron &s;ent me al&s;o. We took our way o|ver the Mountains, having with us two Carts, with 5 Oxen, 2 A&s;&s;es and a Hor&s;e, we had al&s;o &s;everal Renegados with us. All the Company went into the Wood, and fell to work leaving me alone to look to the Carts and Provi&s;ion. After they had been about 3 hours at work, I e&s;pied a Troop of about 300 Men coming towards us, and thinking by the ha&s;t they made towards us, that they were Robbers, I therefore called out to them in the Wood, to give them Notice that they might keep together. When I &s;aw them come within Bow-&s;hot of me I ran away as fa&s;t as I could drive, which they &s;eeing me, &s;ent a Shaft or two, but they did not hit me. Having entred the Wood I met our Company coming out who at fir&s;t &s;toutly re&s;i&s;ted, but finding that the Robbers fell on with a greater violence, and exceeded us both for Arms and Number of Men, they thought good to re|treat with as much ha&s;t as they could. We left here 12 dead, a|mong&s;t which was a <HI>Polish</HI> Renegado; be&s;ides the&s;e that were kil|led we had 20 wounded, and lo&s;t all our Baggage, with Carts, Oxen, A&s;&s;es, &amp;c. and were fain to return &s;o home. For this rea&s;on is it very perillous to hew wood or to pa&s;s tho&s;e mountains upon any other Occa&s;ion, being the Rendevouz of the <HI>Banditti</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding all the Indeavours which the King doth, by &s;ending of Troops down to expell them, cannot be driven out, for
<PB N="236" REF="150">
when they perceiv that any Forces are &s;ent out again&s;t them, they run into Caves and holes in the Hills and Woods: They are al&s;o very well di&s;ciplin'd and as well arm'd, the greate&s;t part thereof con&s;i&s;ting in de&s;erting Soldiers. And by rea&s;on tho&s;e of <HI>Derbent</HI> mu&s;t have all their Fewel and Timber from this Place, and the work put upon the Slaves, it happens that every year a great number of tho&s;e mi&s;erable &s;ort of men are either di&s;patched or wounded.</P>
<P>The next day I was &s;ent up into the Countrey to a place where my Patron kept his Cattle, which I was to look after and drive them up and down where I found the be&s;t Pa&s;turage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au|thor taken and carried away by Robbers.</NOTE> When the Sun was gon down and I driving the Cattle to their Hou&s;e, I met 3 Robbers, who took three Cows away with them, and tied my hands behind my back, &s;o drawing me along; yet it was not long before we met with 8 Gentlemen of <HI>Derbent,</HI> &s;om whereof knew me, being frequently at my Ma&s;ters hou&s;e. The&s;e therefore relea&s;ed me and retook the Bea&s;ts, &s;o that I came &s;afe home: for which kindne&s;s my Ma&s;ter gave them a Pre&s;ent, I &s;uppo&s;e, of more value than what I was &s;old for to him. Un&s;peakable was the kindne&s;s of my Pa|tron that he had for me, for alth&ocirc; my Work was a litle &s;ervile and Slavi&s;h, yet my Bed and Table was Lordly; and what&s;oever I did whether well or ill, he always took it in good part, and would after that time, never &s;uffer me to go abroad to do any work, &s;aying, that he beleeved that I was born under &s;om malevolent Planet. To be brief I found my daily Ta&s;k &s;o ea&s;y, and my u&s;age &s;o comfor|table, that were it not for the name of a Slave and that to a <HI>Mahome|tan,</HI> I could not have lived better abroad in any Place of the World, having litle or no care upon my head.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Iourney to <HI>Sca|machy.</HI></NOTE>About this time my Patron made preparation to take a Journey for <HI>Scamachy,</HI> there to repair his Hou&s;es which were thrown down with an Earth-quake in the year 1667.

The fir&s;t day we pa&s;&s;ed over three Rivers, to wit <HI>Kurgani, Ko&s;tar,</HI> and <HI>Sambur</HI>; whereof the &s;econd is the greate&s;t, running thr&ocirc; the Moun|tains of <HI>Elbur.</HI> This River divides it &s;elf into 5 branches, or arms, broad but &s;hallow, and runs over a &s;tony Ground. The next day

we travailed 8 [<HI>Dutch</HI>] miles further and came to <HI>Koctep</HI> a large vil|lage, where we took our re&s;t for that night.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>SEPT.</HI> 1670.</NOTE> By the way we &s;aw a goodly Tomb erected to the memory of a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Saint, The Inha|bitants of this Town and the Countrey about it are called <HI>Padar</HI> in their Language. They are much addicted to &s;tealth and Robbery, &s;o that we were fain to keep a narrow watch over them the time we lay in the Town, which was not above 8 hours. Their Hou&s;es are but little, built &s;quare and covered on the Top with Earth, not excee|ding 6 or 7 foot high above ground, but are as deep below, as they are high.</P>
<P>On the 3 of the &s;ame moneth we &s;et forward and travailed through many great villages, among&s;t which was a very fair one called <HI>Ni&s;a|bath,</HI> or <HI>Nay&s;abath,</HI> which I gue&s;s lies about 41 <HI>degr.</HI> and a <HI>quart.</HI> It is &s;eated in a very plea&s;ant Countrey of <HI>Old Media,</HI> now called <HI>Surwan,</HI> or <HI>Schirwan.</HI> This is the Place where &s;om time agon the <HI>Hol&s;teyn</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours &s;uffered Shipwrack. At night we &s;et down at <HI>Mu&s;kar,</HI> being a Town without Walls, or any other Fortification but &s;eems to have bin in times pa&s;t a place of tru&s;t, as well from its Situation, as the Ruins of the Walls and Bulwarks which yet ap|pear. By the way we &s;aw abundance of Robbers in the Woods, but they knowing us to be too &s;trong would not adventure the Attempt.</P>
<P>On the 4 we broke up, and that day came to <HI>Scabaran</HI> a little City, where the white&s;t and be&s;t Rice in all <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is brought to market, and grows in the Countrey round about. It is al&s;o in &s;uch plenty that the Hundred weight is &s;old for 13 <HI>Ochbas, [being about</HI> 4 <HI>Shil.</HI> 2 <HI>Pence</HI> Sterl. or a halfpenny <HI>per Pound.</HI>] The Walls of this City are now de|moli&s;hed &s;o that it is no more than an open village. The only Re|markable I found here was the Ruins of the Ovens, wherein they averr <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> had Bread baked for his Army.</P>
<P>On the 5^t^h^. we came to the mountain <HI>Par</HI>&mdash; or <HI>Barmach,</HI> which lies clo&s;e to the Sea, and is very famous for it's many veins of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which is al&s;o called <HI>Median</HI> Oil &amp; <HI>Babilo|ni&s;h Bi|tumen,</HI> of the nature of Marl, which when once &s;et on fire, will burn more vigorou&s;ly if water be poured upon it, but is quen|ched with Earth, Du&s;t, or any other thing that is dry.

<PB N="238" REF="151">
that all hung with Iceicles. On this Hill appear the Ruins of &s;om Watch-Towers, and below have been &s;everal Fortlets to check the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and &s;ecure the <HI>Medians</HI> from the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Scythian</HI> Robbers. Amid&s;t tho&s;e Ruins, is a huge deep Pit digged and laid in with &s;tone. <HI>Naphta,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Petroleum</HI> or <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Per|haps from the <HI>Greek</HI> words <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Oil,</HI> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign"> a <HI>Rock.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Petrelaeum</HI> is an Oil coming naturally out of the veins of the Rock, which veins do run thro the whole &s;tones, as in Marble.

Of this Oil there be two &s;orts; the one tending to a brown or black, which has a very &s;trong &s;mell, but the other which is white is of a lovely &s;mell when fre&s;h, and held in far more e&s;teem than the other.</P>
<P>On the 6 <HI>dito</HI> we &s;et forward again, and went over very high Hills, coming at night to <HI>Bachal</HI> a village &s;eated in a low but fruit|full Valley. Here grows much Rice, and that very good, it being a mar&s;hy Ground, where that Grain likes be&s;t; Barley al&s;o grows there in good plenty. The Inhabitants have an excellent way of making Cakes, the main &s;tuff thereof being Honey and Oil: whereof for the rarene&s;s and novelties &s;ake my Ma&s;ter bought certain to u&s;e on our Journey.</P>
<P>On the 7 <HI>dito</HI> we left <HI>Bachal,</HI> and after a good Days Journey came into <HI>Cothany,</HI> which is a very plea&s;ant Place: and here we took up our Lodging. This Village lies in a low Valley which is full of Woods of Ha&s;les and other &s;mall Trees, in which Woods are the greate&s;t plenty of Hares that ever I have &s;een in all my Life.</P>
<P>On the 8 <HI>dito</HI> we arrived at the famous <HI>Scamachy,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Sumahi,</HI> and <HI>Samachy.</HI> It is a very famous Mart, and lies in 40 <HI>degr.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> In the Province of <HI>Schirwan,</HI> or <HI>Media.</HI> It is hand&s;omly &s;eated in a Vally, &s;o that one cannot &s;ee it till he be within Cannon Shot of the Town.

The Streets are all thr&ocirc; the Town very narrow and the Buildings low, made up of Clay, Planks and Twigs daubed over. In the South-quarter is a &s;pacious Market-place which they call a <HI>Bogan,</HI> having round about it &s;everal rich Shops in Galleries and Piazzas, wherein are &s;een many rich Merchandizes and Manufactories, as Silks, Cot|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, Furrs, Cloth of Gold and Silver, Tape&s;try, &amp;c. Near this place are al&s;o two great Warehou&s;es having &s;everal Portics or Alleys, where all Merchants-&s;trangers buy and &s;ell &s;everal &s;orts of Merchan|dizes. The one of the&s;e is called <HI>Scach Carwan&s;era,</HI> or, the Empe|rours Lodgings, whither <HI>Ru&s;sians</HI> for the mo&s;t part have recour&s;e, and barter their Tin, Copper, Sables and other Commodities: the other is called <HI>Le&s;gi Carwan&s;era, i. e.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> Lodgings; and hither repair mo&s;tly the <HI>Dage&s;tan</HI> and other <HI>Tartars,</HI> who&s;e Trade con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in Men and Children, &s;tole either from their own Nation or the <HI>Ru&s;sians,</HI> as al&s;o in Hor&s;es: hither al&s;o repair many Jews who deal mo&s;tly in Bedding and Cottons.

As for this</HI> Bochdan <HI>the</HI> Poli&s;h <HI>Mini&s;ter, he is not &s;o good a Chri&s;tian as you think, but a light vain</HI> Georgian, <HI>whom the King of</HI> Poland <HI>has di&s;patched to the</HI> Sophy, <HI>to treat about a War with the</HI> Turks, <HI>but &s;uch is his deportment here, and remi&s;sne&s;s in the Affairs of the King his Ma&s;ter, that he will in all probability be called in que&s;tion about it.</HI> All this did not a whit daunt me from my Re&s;olution, for I gave him a certain allowance as to the Character he had given him; or, alth&ocirc; he had been &s;uch a Per&s;on there was more hopes of my coming home thr&ocirc; <HI>Mo&s;covia,</HI> &s;ooner than thr&ocirc; <HI>India,</HI> and &s;o from <HI>Batavia.</HI> This <HI>Bochdan</HI> as I have been &s;ince infor|med had formerly a Command of Hor&s;e under the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and was &s;o well acquainted with the Humor of the King, that he was im|ploy'd on this Amba&s;&s;age, but much envy'd by the <HI>Polanders.</HI> The next day I was &s;old and delivered up to the Amba&s;&s;ador for 150 <HI>Abas,</HI> being the &s;um <HI>Had&s;y Biram</HI> had paid for me to the Prince. Upon my taking leav of my Ma&s;ter, he wi&s;hed me happine&s;s, and withone told me that he was &s;en&s;ible the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had Money enough to redeem a Chri&s;tian, otherwi&s;e he would have taken nothing for me.</P>
<P>And now was none more happy than my &s;elf in imagination, not thinking otherwi&s;e than &s;uddenly to have my Freedom. On the 1 of <HI>November</HI> I was &s;ent for by the Amba&s;&s;adour, where being

introduced into the Parlor, he &s;peedily bad me &s;it down, and fell to a&s;king many Que&s;tions about my Nation, and my coming to be a Slave. I told him all from the Beginning to the End. He then cal|led for a Bowl of Wine, and bade me drink. Whil&s;t I &s;at there, were two young <HI>Georgian</HI> Girls brought to the Door, who being &s;tole by the <HI>Dage&s;tan Tartars,</HI> of hand&s;om Bodies, and tolerable Beauties as al&s;o the Amba&s;&s;adours own Countrey Women he had compa&s;&s;ion of them and bought them for the value of 100 Crowns. The&s;e he kept for Warming Pans, and would upon Occa&s;ion, when he made any Fea&s;t, cau&s;e them to dance: nor did they much &s;eem to be con|cern'd at the lo&s;s of tho&s;e heavy burthens called Maidenheads, alth&ocirc; the Art is to know where they fir&s;t got rid of'em.</P>

<P>ON the 2 of <HI>November</HI> came the Si&s;ter of the Amba&s;&s;ador, and his Brother with a great Retinue and Pomp: their Reception was with an Extravagant Banquet, which dured &s;everal days. So long as this Junketting la&s;ted, was &s;uch Gluttony, Drunkne&s;s and Pro|digality, yea &s;uch bea&s;tline&s;s &s;hown, that I almo&s;t abhorred the name of a Chri&s;tian, when on the other &s;ide I &s;aw the <HI>Mahometans</HI> point at them, who are them&s;elvs very ab&s;temious and temperate.

If any offered to complain he threatned to &s;ell them for Slaves, which tended to the great detriment of tho&s;e his Dome&s;tics, and Di&s;honour of the King and Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> This bred in the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Gentry &s;uch di&s;saffection that they re&s;olved often|times to have revenge; but as tho&s;e who know them&s;elvs con&s;cious of &s;uch ill demeanor are ever in fear of their Per&s;ons, &s;o he who knew him&s;elf guilty of &s;uch wicked doings, had always a certain number of his own Nation to &s;ecure and guard him. However they once finding opportunity, and being already com to the very Ca|ta&s;troph of Patience, began to hew him with their Scymiters and Axes, as he &s;hould go out of his Dining-Room,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Am|ba&s;&s;ador hacked almo&s;t to death.</NOTE> where they chopt and mangled him &s;o that he lay for dead upon the Floor, in the Portic, having received 17 grievous Wounds, and lo&s;t three Fingers of his Right hand: yet by the great diligence and &s;kill of his Chirur|geon who was then at hand, he was re&s;tored to his former Health and Sanity.

Nor with this did the Amba&s;&s;ador hold up, but dayly revenged him|&s;elf of the <HI>Poles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Sca|machi</HI> makes peace.</NOTE> which he u&s;ed as Slaves; and the more to over aw them li&s;ted &s;everal <HI>Georgians</HI>-Soldiers to guard his Body.

He on the Contrary continued a Junketting with tho&s;e of his own Na|tion, that an Ox a day would not have been too much, if it were not for varietie and change of Diet. He bought 13 Kine which he &s;ent out into the Field, and &s;et me to look after them, but finding my &s;elf at a lo&s;s for Victuals, I a&s;&s;umed the liberty to tell his Excellency <HI>that he mu&s;t plea&s;e to &s;end me &s;omthing to eat in the Field.</HI> His an&s;wer was: <HI>If you will have any thing, &s;teal a cow from the</HI> Per&s;ians, <HI>and help your &s;elf &s;o.</HI> But that Commi&s;&s;ion I took occa&s;ion to let alone, being &s;en|&s;ible that my ma&s;ters Order would not excu&s;e me. Thus I &s;uffered more hunger than in all my life, and &s;ore again&s;t my will intimated the matter to my former Patron <HI>Had&s;i Biram,</HI> who gave me this reply, <HI>I told you of it before-hand, what a villain that</HI> Georgian <HI>is, That he was but a Chri&s;tian in &s;how, and far too ba&s;e to be a Mu&s;ulman.</HI> And cer|tainly the Gentleman had good rea&s;on on his &s;ide: for this Amba&s;&s;a|dour well knowing what Beer was brewed for him at the Court in <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> di&s;patches his Brother to the King at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to &s;uppli|cate that they might both be circumci&s;ed, pretending that now know|ing better things than he had hitherto don, therefore could not have Peace or Re&s;t in Con&s;cience, but continual Horror and Inquietude, if he were not admitted as a member in <HI>Mahometani&s;m.</HI> But they had &s;uch ample and clear Information at Court of his Life and Beha|viour; that they ea&s;ily perceiv'd upon what account he did it, and con&s;equently declined his Reque&s;t. Shortly after he al&s;o received a Mandate from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to depart immediatly for <HI>Poland,</HI> which was acceptable news for the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Gentry, hoping at once to be rid of that Slavery and Mi&s;ery they &s;uffered. After my old Patron had di&s;cour&s;ed me a litle about this affair, took his leav of me, &s;ay|ing, John, <HI>I am very &s;orry for your condition, pre'thee therefore com twice

a day to my hou&s;e and eat, or at what time you are hungry.

<P>'Tis true this Offer was very acceptable, but all my fear was, that <HI>Had&s;i</HI> would not tarry long at <HI>Scamachy,</HI> &s;o that I &s;hould again be at a lo&s;s, and therefore I determined with my &s;elf to run away; as then I met with an opportunity to go for <HI>Smyrna</HI> with a great <HI>Cara|van,</HI> which was a preparing and almo&s;t ready to &s;et forward. I had already be&s;poke my &s;elf to go with an <HI>Armenian</HI> who was to &s;et for|ward 6 days before the general Departure with the great <HI>Caravan,</HI> but what rea&s;on I met with to the contrary &s;hall be &s;hortly told.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 4. I went out of the Town to &s;ee if I could &s;peak with an Amba&s;&s;adour who was di&s;patched from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;cou,</HI> and to reque&s;t of him to repre&s;ent our Condition to the <HI>Czar,</HI> but I could not get to &s;peech of him. He had with him 4 Tygres and Leopards for a pre&s;ent to the Great Duke.</P>
<P>On the 11 to my great A&s;toni&s;hment and Joy I &s;aw our Captain <HI>Butler,</HI> together with <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Gunner, <HI>J. van Termund, Chri&s;tian Brand, Lewis Fabritius</HI> and <HI>Peter Arent&s;z</HI> coming into <HI>Scamachy</HI>; upon which in all ha&s;t I ran to bid them welcom and &s;alute them, alth&ocirc; the Captain &s;howed him&s;elf much di&s;plea&s;ed at us, for that we (as he alleadged) went away without his leav and order, and not waiting for him: to which I replied, <HI>Captain you cannot forget what your Order was, That we &s;hould not &s;tay &s;o much as a quarter of an hour for any one, after the Gates were &s;hut, but if any transgre&s;sion of your Order mu&s;t be imputed to us, it mu&s;t be this that we &s;tay'd till midnight for you, and not hearing any thing of you, we concluded that you were either killed in the Tumult, or had made your e&s;cape &s;om other way; we then not holding it &s;afe for us to make any longer delay, thought it more prudence to put off than to &s;tay till it was day light,</HI> &amp;c. With the&s;e and other rea&s;ons I gave him he &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied, and promi&s;ed to do all that lay in his power to pro|cure our Redemption, as from that time forward he laboured very much to do. And this was the rea&s;on, that my intended Journey for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> was not undertaken thinking this to be a more hope|full
<PB N="246" REF="156">
and a more &s;ecure way to get free: for this happened ju&s;t the &s;ame day I had purpo&s;ed to &s;et forward with the <HI>Armenian,</HI> and &s;o after 2 or 3 days Journey to wait for the great <HI>Caravan.</HI> Our Cap|tain applies him&s;elf to the <HI>Chan</HI> of <HI>Scamachy</HI> to intercede for the Cap|tivs, but all he could do might not avail, for there was no Au|dience lent him, It &s;eemed as if the <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Derbent</HI> had hardned his temper, for in pre&s;ence of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and others that had taken the Mediation upon them; whereas on the contrary they had ever been good Friends with the <HI>Calmuc</HI> &amp; <HI>O&s;min,</HI> frequently &s;ending and recei|ving mutual Pre&s;ents from each other.</P>
<P>When the Captain &s;aw there was no hopes to procure our Re|demption at <HI>Scamachy,</HI> he purpo&s;es to go for <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and addre&s;s him&s;elf to the King; the more for that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company might a&s;&s;i&s;t him. He therefore took up &s;eve|ral <HI>Abas</HI> of an <HI>Armenian,</HI> for which he mu&s;t have pay'd 25 <HI>per Cent</HI> more at <HI>I&s;pahan:</HI> he left <HI>I. van Termund</HI> at <HI>Scamachy</HI> for &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>On the 18 <HI>Chri&s;tian Brand</HI> by the interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>I. van Termund,</HI> was taken to board in the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors Hou&s;e, giving good &s;e|curity for the &s;ame at <HI>Scamachy.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while the Brother of the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador went a &s;econd time to Court, for to get the con&s;ent of the <HI>Scach</HI> in changing of his Religion, but the re&s;ult was as unwelcom to him as the former, with an expre&s;s order to depart immediatly for <HI>Poland,</HI> and to give a rea&s;on of his delay. This news as it was very unacceptable to him, for that he was &s;en&s;ible how affairs would be repre&s;ented at <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> there being a Courier di&s;patched off from the <HI>Scach</HI> to the K. of <HI>Poland</HI>; &s;o was it al&s;o very welcom and acceptable news for the op|pre&s;&s;ed Gentlemen in his Retinue. Nor did this outwardly appear at the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court, for upon &s;uch occa&s;ions they never acquaint any Forreign Mini&s;ter with any dislike, but intimate it by their own at the Court from whence they are &s;ent in &s;uch Quality, whence they expect Satisfaction. This when <HI>Bochdan</HI> under&s;tood he &s;tudied all means to avoid going back to <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> and a&s;ked me if I thought that the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, or their Directors there, would con|&s;ent to let him imbarque there for <HI>Holland</HI>? My reply was that I did not beleev it would be granted, and told him &s;everal Praecedents for it, as al&s;o the improbability of the thing &s;ince their Intere&s;t was &s;o
<PB N="247" REF="156">
great in Commerce with <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>; as that they would not do any thing to quit it: However if he would go clande&s;tinly and occa&s;ion a Rumor as if he were gone for <HI>Mo&s;cou,</HI> or &s;om where in <HI>Tartary,</HI> he might imbarque him&s;elf as a privat Per&s;on. This I &s;aid in hopes to come that way home my &s;elf. Yet he was various in his Intentions, &s;omtimes taking a re&s;olution to go for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and &s;omtimes for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or el&s;ewhere. However during the time he was at <HI>Scamachy,</HI> he Lorded it &s;o bravely, that the <HI>Chan</HI> dur&s;t not check him in any extravagancy he committed: for it &s;eems that the &s;aid <HI>Chan</HI> had taken up a con&s;iderable Sum of the Amba&s;&s;ador upon Intere&s;t and not being able to pay was fain to re&s;t contented. But the Am|ba&s;&s;ador willing to get in his Money and the <HI>Chan</HI> not in a Capacity to pay it upon demand, the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent his Brother to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to make complaint to the <HI>Schach,</HI> which when the <HI>Chan</HI> had under|&s;tood, &s;ent a Po&s;t after him, who intreated him to return back, upon promi&s;e of Payment, and full Solution both of Stock and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 21 came a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> to <HI>Scamachy</HI> with <HI>William Barent&s;z Klopper</HI> our Chief-Mate, who had been taken by the <HI>Tartars</HI> and &s;everely u&s;ed all the time. The &s;aid <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> offered him to the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor who on the 30^t^h^. bought him. The <HI>Scemkal</HI> had fir&s;t &s;old him to a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> of <HI>Bachu</HI> for 150 <HI>Abas.</HI> This new Patron &s;et him to keep Cattle, in a Pa&s;ture, between <HI>Derbent</HI> and <HI>Scamachy,</HI> where upon our Journey to <HI>Scamachy</HI> I &s;aw, but knew him not. He had a very churli&s;h fellow to his Patron, and therefore attempting &s;everal times to run away was &s;till caught again, and beat mo&s;t &s;everely: and now being redeemed came unexpectedly out of the Frying Pan into the Fire.</P>

<P>ON the 9^t^h^. departed the Si&s;ter of <HI>Bochdan</HI> the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador for <HI>Tafflis</HI> with 7 Camels and conducted with &s;om <HI>Georgian</HI> Sol|diers. The City <HI>Tafflis</HI> is di&s;tant from <HI>Scamachy,</HI> about 8 Leagues. The next day her Brother, with the Amba&s;&s;adors Chirurgeon cal|led <HI>Adam</HI> departed al&s;o. This Chirurgeon was a <HI>Polonian</HI> by Birth, and had been &s;ent for by the Prince of <HI>Tafflis,</HI> who intreated the Amba&s;&s;ador to let him come; promi&s;ing him a &s;ufficient Salary, be&s;ides, his Diet, Appartments at Court, 4 Slaves of whether &s;ex he liked, and to provide him a Wife of his own chu&s;ing and Reli|gion, the Prince being him&s;elf a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic. The Chirur|geon with whom I was very intimate would often con&s;ult the Mat|ter

with me, and a&s;k what advice I could give him.
I alwaies coun|cil'd him,
<Q>Not to neglect &s;uch a golden Opportunity, telling him further what he had to expect if he &s;hould continue with &s;uch a Varlet as <HI>Bochdan</HI> was, who was both greedy and ingrate|full for the be&s;t &s;ervice any one could do him, alth&ocirc; it were &s;upere|rogatory. That if the Amba&s;&s;adour &s;hould return for <HI>Poland,</HI> as 'twas a matter very dubious, he would &s;till be <HI>in &s;tatu quo,</HI> and mu&s;t if he &s;tay'd here never hope for any advancement by him who was becom loath&s;om to the wor&s;t of men.</Q>
He thanked me for my advice, and re&s;olved to do as I had council'd him; and &s;oon after departed, as is &s;aid. Right &s;orry I was when he left us, being ever kind to me and other Slaves, alth&ocirc; I was by duty injoyn'd to wi&s;h and rejoyce at his Welfare, for his extraordinary Civilities. The Prince of <HI>Tafflis</HI> began fir&s;t to be taken with him upon his noble cure performed on the Amba&s;&s;ador, when he was &s;truck down by the <HI>Poles,</HI> as was &s;aid before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Corps of a rich <HI>In|dian</HI> bur|ned with a Woman Slave.</NOTE>On the 15 died at <HI>Scamachy,</HI> one <HI>Tzouke</HI> a very rich <HI>Indian,</HI> who&s;e Corps his Brother after their manner de&s;ired to burn, which by a very long and importunate interce&s;&s;ion of the Prince was granted, he paying for the &s;ame about .1300 Crowns. The <HI>Indian</HI> having ob|tained this Grant the next day bought a Chri&s;tian Woman, which he burned with the Corps. The Bodie and the Woman were car|ried together without into the Field where they had made up a great Staple of Wood and a place within for the Corps.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prie&s;ts give the Woman a Potion and with an Engine throw her into the Fire.</NOTE> The <HI>Indian</HI> Prie&s;ts gave the Woman a Potion to provoke &s;leep and then &s;et her upon an Engine like a Crane or Whip, made on purpo&s;e letting her &s;o fall into the Fire. In the mean time the <HI>Bonzi</HI> poured a great Ve&s;&s;el of Turpentine Oil upon the Wood and &s;o &s;et it on fire, and then gave the Engine a turn, upon which the Woman fell into the fire. 'Tis true the Woman &s;eemed by vertue of that Potion to be fallen into a <HI>Cataphor,</HI> or Dead-&s;leep, yet I heard her &s;hriek out &s;everal times till the Drums, Pipes, Trumpets and other Wind-Mu&s;ic began to play, which was &s;o loud and alti&s;onant, that I could not hear any lon|ger, alth&ocirc; I got a place near the Pile which was erected for the&s;e Ceremonies. Such practi&s;e was al&s;o in u&s;e among the Idolaters of <HI>Palae&s;tina,</HI> who offered their Children to <HI>Moloch.</HI> When the Fire had con&s;umed all, the A&s;hes were thrown into the River.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="158">On the 21 was a great noi&s;e in Town about 2 Men that were murthered, and the Homicides unknown.

Hither flocked al&s;o Women from all parts and Countreys round about, e&s;teeming it a work of merit. The Per&s;ons murthe|red were but ordinary People, and Citizens of the meane&s;t &s;ort, &s;o that the <HI>Chan,</HI> did not u&s;e much diligence in hunting out the Ma|lefactors, for without Money Ju&s;tice is rarely don. After the Corps had laid here about 2 hours, as was &s;aid, they were by Order of the <HI>Chan</HI> carried away upon Barrows and interred in the Field, with &s;om few Ceremonies. Every night were &s;et up &s;everal Torches, and by day went Hundreds of Women to perform the u&s;ual So|lemnities and &s;uper&s;titious Rites at their Tombs. The Ceremonies are as vain as fooli&s;h which they do about the Dead; at their fir&s;t coming there they bow down three times at the Grave, and as often ki&s;s it, adorning the Place round about with Flags of &s;everal Co|lours which they make fa&s;t to &s;ticks.</P>
<P>On the 27 was a general Exultation expre&s;&s;ed at <HI>Scamachy,</HI> with Beating of Drums, Sounding of Trumpets and variety of Wind-Mu&s;ic, for that the <HI>Chans</HI> Son had a <HI>Robe of Favour</HI> be&s;towed upon him, and one of the Kings Wives; which were &s;ent him for a Pre|&s;ent as a Mark of Loyalty: and indeed the latter is never don but upon the &s;core of an exceeding high Favour; and alth&ocirc; they have the names of the <HI>Kings Wives,</HI> yet it mo&s;tly happens that they are pure Virgins, it being a thing impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould make u&s;e of &s;o many as are dayly brought to him from all parts of his wide Dominions, which are alwaies the mo&s;t &s;elect Beauties; however the Grandees of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> are le&s;s contented when they find them Maids, than otherwi&s;e, and for that rea&s;on do as duly conceal it, as others who find the contrary on privat Occa&s;ions; <HI>For,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>'tis a Greater Honour to fi&s;h in the Kings Pond, than in one of their own:</HI> Nor are the Women altogether &s;ad at &s;uch di&s;po&s;als, &s;ince they live, as

I gave them al&s;o a full Demon|&s;tration of what he had done for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Slaves, as al&s;o an account of his Worth in re&s;pect of his Race and De&s;cent, he being of one of the noble&s;t Families in the Countrey, and was able to remitt what they thought good to di&s;bur&s;e for him.</P>
<P>On the 19 <HI>dito</HI> were 6 Silver Plates &s;tollen out of our Ma&s;ters Hou&s;e which put all into a di&s;order, he being &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate that nought could appea&s;e him; and &s;u&s;pecting one Man for the Theft, he cau&s;ed him to be tortured in the pre&s;ence of all the Family, alth&ocirc; he was innocent as to the Fact. Fir&s;t he was beat with &s;ticks on the &s;oles of his Feet which he neverthele&s;s manfully &s;tood out: when this was done they held his Feet clo&s;e to the Fire, which made him yell and roar out, that the Hair of my Head &s;tood on end; and in as much as he could not any longer endure the Torment, he con|fe&s;&s;ed what he was not guilty of, as afterwards appeared; alth&ocirc; when he was taken away he denied all: and thus the poor man meerly becau&s;e he was a <HI>Pole</HI> &s;o u&s;ed that he could neither &s;tand nor go, nor was allowed a &s;ufficient care to re&s;tore him to his former Sanity, nor had any thing by way of &s;atisfaction, as an acknow|ledgment of a wrong.</P>
<P>About this time came news from <HI>Tefflis</HI> about the Chirurgeon who had done that operation on the Amba&s;&s;ador, how that the Prince having under&s;tood that he was arrived &s;ent for him, and after many Care&s;&s;es and in order to his Promi&s;e, &s;ent for one of the mo&s;t emi|nent Merchants in the City, who had one only Daughter. The

Prince then makes the Overture, telling him that young Gentleman was one with whom he had intru&s;ted his Life, and a&s;ked if he would give him his Daughter in Marriage. The Merchant was at fir&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ed, hardly ready enough to give con&s;ent that a &s;tranger he had never heard of in his Life &s;hould have his only Daughter; and yet dur&s;t not well deny him, for tho&s;e Princes rule with an Arbitrary Power; and alth&ocirc; out of &s;ome &s;how of Courte&s;y they &s;eem to reque&s;t a thing of their Subjects, yet when occa&s;ion &s;ervs they command at their di&s;cretion: nor dare the Subject either murmure or oppo&s;e them in the lea&s;t, for fear of parting with their &s;weet Lives, and lo&s;s of E&s;tate which is taken from their Po&s;terity. The Father gives con&s;ent but thought her too young for the nuptial Bed, &s;he not ex|ceeding 12 years of Age, and therefore pray'd the Marriage might be put off till &s;he was 2 years elder; however the Contract was &s;igned in pre&s;ence of the Prince, with Condition that &s;he came to die without I&s;&s;ue that her E&s;tate &s;hould devolve upon him. In fine he was there in very great reputation and gave the Merchant rea&s;on to be well &s;atisfied with his Per&s;on; who &s;how'd him all Po&s;&s;ible Favour and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 26 <HI>dito</HI> our Patron, the Amba&s;&s;adour, got intelligence of the Party that had &s;tole his Plate, being di&s;covered by a Gold&s;mith that had bought it; for Notice was given to all the Gold&s;miths in <HI>Scamachy,</HI> that if any one bought it, he &s;hould have his Money again, and a Reward to boot. Yet this Delinquent had more favour &s;hown him than the Party who was put to the torment before, th&ocirc; inno|cent of the Fact; for this received only a few blows on the Foot, and was declared free. He was a <HI>Polander,</HI> not in &s;ervice of the Am|ba&s;&s;ador, but only a Para&s;ite who frequented the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>March</HI> was another <HI>Indian</HI> Corps burned with a Live-Woman, after the &s;ame manner as was &s;aid before; only the Wood was poured over with <HI>Naphte,</HI> in place of Turpentine Oil.</P>

All the Winter long I was not permitted to come in the Kitchin, much le&s;s at the Stove, &s;o that I had no way to warm my &s;elf, unle&s;s when I found &s;om pieces of wood among the Rub|bi&s;h which I lay together and made a Fire of; but what was wor&s;t I dur&s;t not for my life complain, however with the approachment of the acceptable Summer &s;ea&s;on I was ea&s;'d of that one hard&s;hip.</P>

<P>After this follow'd the &s;econd Pageant which was carried by the like number of Men.

La&s;t of all came another &s;mall Pageant, with a fair blew Silk Covering, and thereon &s;ate a Youngman who read all the way in a great Book. After the&s;e Pageants, or Brancards, fol|lowed 4 Noble-men, each leading a hor&s;e of State, richly cappari|&s;on'd: The Saddles being of Gold, and be&s;et with Precious Stones.

And the &s;ame day we got Tidings from <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">News from <HI>A&s;tra|chan.</HI></NOTE> that the City was of a certainty taken in by the Great Duke, that the Army of the <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> was beat in open Field, and <HI>Stephen Radzin,</HI> the grand Belwether taken alive. The Succe&s;s of the Day next to the Power of the Almighty was a&s;cribed to the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces, for which good &s;ervice they received con&s;iderable Favours from the <HI>Czar,</HI> and were beyond the <HI>Ru&s;sians</HI> them&s;elvs remunerated with &s;everal Tokens of Gratitude.</P>
<P>On the 20 was a great Wre&s;tling Match, of 6 expert Wre&s;tlers being &s;trangers, who quitted them&s;elvs in the Game with an admi|rable Dexterity, doing many noble Exerci&s;es in pre&s;ence of &s;everal Hundred Spectators, who could not behold them but with great Wonder. When they had performed all, they went about with a Porceline Di&s;h to de&s;ire Money by way of reward.</P>
<P>On the 21 were two of the Amba&s;&s;adors Gentlemen taken into Cu&s;tody, and put into fetters by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> for that they had lay with a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Woman. The Woman her &s;elf was &s;hortly after brought and delivered to the Amba&s;&s;ador, to deal with her according to his Di&s;cretion; and if he liked to hew her into Gobbets, &s;uch bein the De&s;ire of her Husband, who declared him&s;elf willing to acquie&s;ce

in what was done. But the Amba&s;&s;adour who had been &s;o long at the Academy of <HI>Venus,</HI> was &s;uch an expert Proficient that he could &s;ay his Le&s;&s;on with out book as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll as his Dome&s;tics, take'em one for one: and in &s;hort had &s;uch compa&s;&s;ion on her that he &s;ent her away a free Remi&s;&s;ionary, but not without reconciling her to her Hus|band. Soon after the Gentlemen al&s;o got inlargement.</P>
<P>On the 22 a Youngman (according to Sentence pa&s;&s;ed upon him) was beat to death with Sticks, being to pa&s;s thr&ocirc; the Town and at the Corner of every Street to receiv a certain number of Blows, till at la&s;t he dropped down dead. This was mainly occa&s;ioned upon the reque&s;t of his unnatural and mercile&s;s Father, who was an eminent Gentleman, and Inhabitant of <HI>Scamachy.</HI> The Crime for which he was accu&s;ed was a kind of Satyr, or a Pa&s;quil, which he had written and &s;ent to the Governour: the main purport whereof was in the&s;e Words. <HI>How comes it that your Lord&s;h, grows &s;uch a great Saint all on a &s;udden? Who has po&s;se&s;sed your mind to alter tho&s;e long continued Cu&s;toms of the</HI> Per&s;ians? <HI>And do you not know what Dishonour it is to all the</HI> Mu&s;ulmans <HI>and the whole Kingdom in general? Or are you indeed becom a Chri&s;tian?</HI> &amp;c. This Inno|vation he meant, was an Interdiction which the <HI>Chan</HI> or Governour, had i&s;&s;ued 3 days after the Proce&s;&s;ion, That none &s;hould hew and cut (as was their Cu&s;tom) with Swords in the Streets, like as we have &s;poke more amply in the Fea&s;t of <HI>Aly.</HI> The Father, &s;om &s;aid, dur&s;t not but make complaint, le&s;t it &s;hould have been imputed to him|&s;elf as Mi&s;pri&s;ion, it being well known by others that it was his Son who &s;ent the Libel. But it may be ob&s;erved that tho&s;e who would put the affair in that Po&s;ture, were either prejudic'd or bya&s;&s;ed Per|&s;ons. But others who were indifferent looked upon it as an Example of Unmercifulne&s;s and Ambition, where he only did it for Hopes of Favour from the <HI>Chan,</HI> which be e&s;teemed a Purcha&s;e aequivalent to his &s;ons Life. The next day was another Man beat to Death, by 7 of the <HI>Chans</HI> Dome&s;tics before the Gates of the Palace, but for what I could not learn.</P>

In&s;olencies perpetrated by the Wood-rangers:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>JUNE.</HI> 1671.</NOTE> and on the 29 &s;et for|ward, taking with him <HI>Peter Arent&s;z</HI> of <HI>Schevelingen,</HI> one of our Ships-Company, and a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Jew, who had been taken by the <HI>Scemkal-Tartars</HI> and made his E&s;cape.</P>
<P>On the 30 aro&s;e a mo&s;t hideous Tempe&s;t of Wind, Thunder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Storms and Hail.</NOTE> Hail and Lightning; which continued for two days together after which all was very calm and &s;till and the air very &s;erene. The Hail did much damage to the Fruit, every Hail&s;tone being of an unu&s;ual bigne&s;s, &s;om as large as the Egg of a Hen or Turky.</P>
<P>On the 6 of <HI>June</HI> I went with a <HI>Venetian</HI> (who had bin a Slave in <HI>Turky</HI> and run away) about 15 Miles w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thin Land, where we found an <HI>Armenian</HI> Friary. The Mona&s;tics received and treated us very kindly, when they under&s;tood that we were Chri&s;tians, and in Slavery to the <HI>Mahometans.</HI> They intreated us to tell them all the pa&s;|&s;ages we had met with abroad, which the <HI>Venetian</HI> fir&s;t did, and after|wards de&s;iring me to do the like, I related all in brief, which they took great delight to hear, e&s;pecially about the taking in of <HI>A&s;trachan.</HI> They de&s;ired us further to tarry with them for &s;om time, which we pro|mi&s;ed to do, and accordingly &s;tay'd there two nights. All the time they care&s;&s;ed us with all kindne&s;s imaginable, neither &s;paring for Victuals nor good Drink: profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elvs &s;orry that our con|dition would not allow them the happine&s;s of a longer enjoyment of our Company. Their manner of Life was very &s;ingle, without any Incumbrance of the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> their Hous-holding regular and gentile, and the Men among them&s;elvs mutually loving one ano|ther, and &s;ociable with &s;trangers, very charitable to all that were in nece&s;&s;ity, of what Opinion or Faith &s;oever they were. Right loath we were to leav them, but not daring to &s;tay any longer, we took our leavs of them, thanking them for their kindne&s;s and civility they had &s;hown us. In taking our way to <HI>Scamachy,</HI> we were fain to climb over &s;ome Hills, and one great Mountain flat at Top, upon which was a Lake, according to our gue&s;&s;ing, 3 miles in Circuit. Going along the &s;hore to our great amazement we found four Bodies of Men that had but newly been murthered, having their throats cut, we &s;up|po&s;ed them to be Anglers, &s;eeing Fi&s;hing Canes and other Imple|ments about them. However, we thinking it for two rea&s;ons un&s;afe for us to &s;tay there any longer, made all the ha&s;t we could to get out
<PB N="270" REF="170">
of the way. This Lake as we afterwards under&s;tood was very plen|tifull of many kinds of delicate Fi&s;h, which are &s;old very dear and highly e&s;teemed of abroad throughout all that part of the Countrey, and indeed it was once our thoughts to make a Trial if we could take any thing, till meeting with the&s;e new murthered Per&s;ons, we chu&s;ed rather to let the Fi&s;h remain in their Element, than by the probable con&s;equence to pay too great a price for our &s;port.</P>
<P>On the 9 happened a very Tragical pa&s;&s;age at <HI>Scamachy,</HI> which, notwith&s;tanding the horrible &s;pectacle I had &s;een the Day before, made my Heart beat withrn my Brea&s;t, as it did many times after that, when it came into my mind. A <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Woman and a Slave was taken by a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> for his Wife. Whether &s;he had &s;om private Quarrel with him, or that &s;he was con&s;cious of &s;om misbehaviour to him I cannot determine, however &s;he came to my Patron the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, fir&s;t making a large Demon&s;tration of her State, and of her Friends and Family in <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;he reque&s;ted that my Lord would vouch&s;afe her his Protection, till &s;uch time as &s;he could meet with an oppor|tunity to convey her &s;elf clande&s;tinly home into her own Countrey. My Lord, at the earne&s;t intreaty of &s;om Dome&s;tics who were his Minions, a&s;&s;ented: but after &s;he had &s;o privily held her &s;elf about the &s;pace of 14 days, her Husband got Intelligence by &s;om Pick-thank or other, where &s;he was, applies him&s;elf immediatly to Court, where (after a litle &s;oliciting) he gets an Order to fetch her out, and u&s;e her as &s;eemed good to him. But con&s;idering that the Dome&s;tics of my Lord were too numerous and a little unruly, he dur&s;t not attempt to make the demand, but went back again to Court de&s;iring A&s;&s;i|&s;tance upon which the Prince &s;ent &s;om of his Officers, who when our People &s;aw that they were com in a warrantable way, dur&s;t not oppo&s;e them, nor had they any conveniency to put her out of the way, &s;o that &s;he was forthwith delivered into the hand of her Hu&s;|band. The Man having as was &s;aid permi&s;&s;ion to puni&s;h her at his own Di&s;cretion had already provided a Wooden Cro&s;s, upon which, with the help of his Servants, he bound her fa&s;t, being mother naked, and with his own hands flea'd her whil&s;t yet living. I &s;tood my &s;elf all the while at the Door with a great Company of Men, Women and Children, and heard her cry out mo&s;t bitterly. Yet none thought that his cruelty was of &s;o high a nature till we &s;aw the

Carca&s;e, thrown out into the &s;treet where it lay an hour or two, and afterwards by his order was dragged into the Fields, to be devoured of the Eagles, and other Birds of prey: but he not &s;atisfied here|with took the Skin and nailed it upon the Wall for a Monument and Warning to his other Wives, which were 12 in number, who never &s;aw it but trembled, as indeed I my &s;elf did, &s;o often as I went by the Hou&s;e, or pa&s;&s;ed by that way. It is a plain Proverb, not &s;o common as true, <HI>The Old Woman had not &s;ought her Daughter in the Oven, had &s;he never bin there her &s;elf:</HI> and &s;o the Men in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lou&s;y of the <HI>Per|&s;ians.</HI></NOTE> or at le&s;t about the&s;e Parts, being generally prone to Venery, and without the bounds of Continency, harbour and &s;u&s;tain an ill Opinion of their Wives, whom they will have to be cha&s;t and loyal. This Jealou&s;y is the rea|&s;on that few who covet a good name and would be reputed hone&s;t go with any part of their bodies uncovered, &s;ave only their Eies, their Face being muffled up in Silks or Cotton. Tho&s;e who go with un|covered Heads, are &s;uch as we commonly call Game&s;ters, and pro|&s;titute. So &s;oon as any one comes in a doors, the Woman runs into a Chamber and locks her &s;elf up that &s;he may not be &s;een, alth&ocirc; the Slaves have often the Opportunity to violate their Ma&s;ters Couch notwith&s;tanding all the Indeavours they u&s;e to &s;uppre&s;s them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eunuchs.</NOTE> But the King and the Great ones of the Realm prevent that by gelding their Slaves; which they doe very effectually, but Mode&s;ty forbids me to make further mention of the Manner. They do it commonly when they are young, buying Children that are &s;tollen from their Parents, and are therefore in regard of their bringing up, held in greater value than others, as al&s;o becau&s;e that there is hardly one in three that both live and like. The price which is &s;et upon them is one rea&s;on why ordinary Per&s;ons have them not, and another is becau&s;e that if they thrive they grow very fat and lazy, and con&s;e|quently unfit to do any &s;ervice they have occa&s;ion for. And by rea|&s;on that Women-Slaves are &s;omewhat rare among them, the Mer|chants and Citizens Wives are mo&s;tly attended by Men, who if they have a &s;prightly and airy way and Carriage, are &s;omtimes admitted to enjoy tho&s;e illicit Plea&s;ures, which in proce&s;s of time they recom|pence with the lo&s;s of their Lives.</P>

On the Countrey through which this Ri|ver &s;oftly glides we &s;aw &s;everal Cottages or Tents, as we did the day before, but found the Inhabitants harmle&s;s and very poor, yet mer|ry and jocund, the Children were &s;tark naked, and the Men and Wo|man had hardly cloaths enough to cover their middle. They received us in very friendly manner according to their ability, bringing us Milk for our &s;elvs, and Provender for the Camels and Hor&s;es, which they &s;old at a very mean and incon&s;iderable Price, con&s;idering under what nece&s;&s;ity we were then. This day we travailed 6 [<HI>Dutch</HI>] Leagues.</P>
<P>On the 5 we travailed about as far as we did the day before, but were fain to take up our Lodging under the great Canopy of Heaven, &s;etting down with the whole <HI>Caravan,</HI> near &s;om Water-pitts, where we found good pa&s;turage for the Bea&s;ts, con&s;idering the &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>The next day we found an end of the Heath <HI>Mokan,</HI> and had High-land to travail over, as the Mountains of <HI>Bethzyrvan,</HI> or <HI>Beth|zyrum.</HI> This day we cro&s;&s;ed a &s;mall River (if I well remember) 12 times, having a crooked or &s;erpentine Cour&s;e, which the Merchants

At night we got the Village <HI>Schechmurat,</HI> where my Patron &s;ent me out to fetch &s;om Spring-Water: but being about half an [<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>] mile without the Town was a&s;&s;ail'd by 3 Robbers, who &s;uddenly came running out upon me, having their Eies fixed my Armor; &s;o that in all probability, that which I had for my De|fence would have been my Death, if &s;om belonging to the <HI>Caravan</HI> and &s;ent upon the &s;ame Errand, had not com in time to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; for I was almo&s;t out of breath with defending my &s;elf, having my Back again&s;t the Ruins of an old Wall, which &s;eemed to be the Relicts of &s;om Watch-Tower. One of the 3 I had wounded very &s;ore on the Arm, but the other two breaking in proved too &s;trong for me: yet when they &s;ay the re&s;t com in and clo&s;e up with them, thought it better to make u&s;e of their Heels than their Hands.</P>
<P>On the 7^t^h^. we travailed over very hilly and montanous Ground, encamping that night in a Valley, which was wa&s;t, and de&s;titute of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>On the 8^t^h^. we came to a very fair and commodious <HI>Caerawan&s;era,</HI> built at the Charges of the <HI>Indian</HI> Traders, for the conveniency of their <HI>Caraevans:</HI> Here we intended to remain over night, but begin|ning to take our Re&s;t, were alarm'd upon a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault of a great Troop of Robbers, who fell upon the <HI>Caravan</HI> on every &s;ide, and plundered all they came at, that was of any value and portable; and alth&ocirc; we had timely notice to defend our &s;elvs, yet they had got a con|&s;iderable Booty, and made their e&s;cape without the lo&s;s of any Per|&s;on or the le&s;t damage. We therefore fearing that the incouragement and &s;ucce&s;s they had met with might embolden them to make up a &s;tronger Troop, and con&s;equently our tarrying there might be very un&s;afe, it was unanimou&s;ly concluded that we &s;hould break up, and being fair Weather, pur&s;ue our Journey by travailing the night, as we did, and about 12 a clock came to <HI>Tzanle,</HI> which is a beautiful Town, but not fortified, where it was thought fit that we &s;hould &s;tay till the next morning: <HI>Tzanle</HI> is a Paradi&s;e in regard of it's plea&s;ant Situation; round about which is nothing to be &s;een, but Orchards, Gardens and Hou&s;es of Recreation.

<P>On the 9^t^h we found very bad travailing way and with great Dif|ficulty, went over the Mountains of <HI>Trizetlu,</HI> out of which Moun|tains ari&s;eth the River <HI>Cara&s;u,</HI> and after it has encompa&s;&s;ed many Mountains glides with a &s;oft and gentle &s;tream thr&ocirc; the Valleys, till it finds the great <HI>Araxes,</HI> into which it di&s;gorgeth it's &s;elf with an incredible noi&s;e.

<P>The next day we broke up, and went thr&ocirc; the Town <HI>Kelchera,</HI> which is about half an hours walking from <HI>Ardebil,</HI> where is the no|ble <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> or Sepulchre of <HI>Zide Tzaybrail,</HI> the Father of <HI>Scech Se|phy.</HI> This <HI>Tzaybrail</HI> was in his life time a man of a mean and &s;lender Fortune, as well in Sub&s;tance as Parts, but <HI>Sedredin</HI> his Grandchild willing to make him co&euml;qual with his Father in the Calender, cau&s;ed all his Bones to be gathered together and brought to this Shrine, which was erected to his perpetual Memory.

Every Man has his freedom to walk and recreate him&s;elf, but upon a very &s;trict penalty not to pluck either Flower or Fruit. I was told how that 5 years before my being there, a drunken <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> had hewn down a great bough with his Scymiter, but being taken was immediatly beheaded with the &s;ame Weapon. In this Gate hung al&s;o another great Silver Chain, which was given by the <HI>Chan</HI> of <HI>Kentzay.</HI> Here they demanded our Weapons, which being delivered, my Patron went forward to another Gate, which entring he fell down and ki&s;&s;ed the Thre&s;hold, withall charging me not to touch it with my Feet, le&s;t I &s;hould pollute that which many thought worthy a long Pilgrimage to com and ki&s;s: he told me al&s;o that it was a favour greater than ordinary, that I being a blind ignorant Chri&s;tian and an Infidel &s;hould be admitted to pry into &s;o glorious a Sanctuary. I was heartily content to obey his Will, rather than to deny my Curio&s;ity, and followed him clo&s;e at the Heels, le&s;t coming into &s;om Labrynth I &s;hould loo&s;e my Life by the Lo&s;s of my Ma&s;ter. The next Place we came into was a &s;tately Gallery, or rather an Antichamber, arched cro&s;s wi&s;e, and neatly plai&s;tered. On the right hand as I went in was a great Silver Cock which ran with Water that was conveyed thither by leaden Pipes from a fair Fountain about 4 [<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>] miles without Town.

In this Kitchin is provided Victuals for more than a Thou&s;and People, one day with another, to wit, Prie&s;ts, Pilgrims, and other Poor People which have here their Maintenance. They eat three times a day, at 6 in the Morning, at 10 before, and 3 in the afternoon. The two fir&s;t Meals were given by <HI>Schach Sephy,</HI> and the la&s;t at the Charges of the pre&s;ent King.

<P>FOurteen Days we &s;taid in <HI>Ardebil,</HI> during which time I had lei|&s;ure to &s;ee what was worthy of Remark, and Opportunity be&s;ides, being apparreled like a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;o that none di&s;tru&s;ted me to be a <HI>Mu|&s;ulman,</HI> but allowed me acce&s;s over all. When the&s;e 14 days were expired, the <HI>Caravan</HI> made preparation to break up, and pur&s;ue the Journey for <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> for which end many fre&s;h Camels and Hor&s;es were taken in. When the <HI>Caravan</HI> was ready, we ob&s;erved that the Company was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed with new Pa&s;&s;engers and Mer|chants.</P>
<P>On the 25 by &s;ound of Trumpet all was warned to joyn them&s;elvs with the <HI>Caravan,</HI> that intended for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pahan</HI>; and accordingly left <HI>Ardebil</HI> and came to <HI>Bu&s;un</HI> which lies about 14 Miles from <HI>Ardebil,</HI> where we &s;taid that night.</P>
<P>The day following we broke up, and had that day a very rocky and

unea&s;y Way, in&s;omuch that mo&s;t, or all, allighted from their Hor&s;es and Camels and went a foot. By the way we met &s;everal Troops of Robbers, who probably had under&s;tood what a Prey and Purcha&s;e we had, yet finding the <HI>Caravan</HI> &s;o very numerous dur&s;t not a&s;&s;ail us. At night we came to <HI>Sengoa</HI> a beautifull Village, where we had very good Wine, and made our &s;elvs merry, but not to exce&s;s, for that is in general odious to the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Here I &s;aw the be&s;t Beauties and mo&s;t comly Faces that I have &s;een in all <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> their Women &s;eem to have a greater Liberty than in mo&s;t places, where they do not only go covered abroad, but are al&s;o denied the conver&s;e with Men; for here they go bare with their Face, and are very familiar with tho&s;e of the Ma&s;culine Gender, and if I be not mi&s;taken were too fami|liar with &s;ome, who within a few daies after began to &s;cratch their Heads, and this is the fir&s;t time I knew that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Women un|der&s;tood <HI>French.</HI> In &s;um, our Company enjoy'd them&s;elvs here &s;o contentedly and well, that &s;om of'em thought the Sun had mi&s;taken him&s;elf and was ri&s;en an hour too &s;oon.</P>
<P>The day following leaving <HI>Sengoa,</HI> we had high and rocky way, but towards the Evening came into a mo&s;t &s;weet and plea&s;ant Dale or Plain, through which a River glided very &s;wiftly. This Valley was very plea&s;ant, and notwith&s;tanding the &s;ea&s;on, appeared as if it were in <HI>May.</HI> This River is called <HI>Ki&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lo&s;eyn,</HI> having a very fair Stone Bridge over it, over which we pa&s;&s;ed and pitched on the South &s;ide, in the open Field, for there were no Hou&s;es to be &s;een.</P>
<P>On the 28^t^h^. we broke up and went over the famous <HI>Taurus,</HI> being a very rough and dangerous way, in&s;omuch that all the Company were fain to allight and lead their Camels and Hor&s;es, till we came into a Valley where we took our Re&s;t for an Hour, or two. This Valley is very deep and a Ne&s;t of Robbers and Vagabonds, who find many lurking Places to hide them&s;elvs in, out of which they a&s;&s;ail and &s;urpri&s;e Travailers, if they think them&s;elvs &s;trong enough: but we, as was &s;aid before, being increa&s;ed to a con&s;iderable Number knew our &s;elvs &s;ufficiently out of peril. Out of this Valley ari&s;eth the River <HI>Ki&s;ilo&s;eyn,</HI> which running very &s;wiftly and beating thorow the Rocks makes a very hideous Murmur, &s;o that one cannot hear another &s;peak: thus receiving as it were inlargement runs through the Champain Countrey of <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lan,</HI> and thence is hurried with an ad|mirable

celerity into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Lake, into which it empties it &s;elf. On the Banks of this River is a Village bearing the &s;ame name, where is a fair Stone Bridge of 9 Arches, or Bows. All along the Way &s;ide grow great plenty of Almond, Cypre&s;s and other Trees, which &s;erved us all the way in &s;tead of <HI>Para&s;ols:</HI> but when we were come over the River found the Way very bad, being forced to clamber over Rocks, the Path being &s;o narrow that only one Camel at once could go on it. On each &s;ide were many great Clefts and deep Caves, which with the rattling of the Hor&s;es feet made a dreadfull and horrid Eccho; and being come to a place which was the fulle&s;t of tho&s;e Caverns, all the Company gave a Shout, which with an Eccho re&s;oun|ded from one Place to another, that it &s;eemed as if there had been 10 or 12 Troops of Men in &s;o many &s;everal Places calling to one another. On this way it happened that a Camel broke the Leathers wherewith his Pack was fa&s;tened to the Crutchet or Saddle, being ju&s;t at the Brink of a wide and deep Pit, where no Bottom could be &s;een. It co&s;t the Slaves who attended him much labour to &s;ave him, and were in &s;truggling once in great hazard them&s;elvs of tumbling down, Camel and all, yet at la&s;t, with lo&s;s of the Pack which in &s;pite of all they could do fell down, they got clear. The Pack was very rich, and the lo&s;s thereof &s;o concerning to the Merchant, that if others had not hindred him he had thrown the Slaves after it, for their Negligence. This ill way much detarded us on this Days Jour|ney, for we were more than 5 Hours in travailing one Mile. Being got over this bad way we found a Village where it was de&s;igned that we &s;hould take our nights re&s;t; The name of the Town was <HI>Keyntze,</HI> being very poor and not in a Condition to &s;upply us with &s;uch Ne|ce&s;&s;aries as we de&s;ired for our Money.</P>
<P>On the 29 we broke up, and had that day very good way, coming at night to the village <HI>Hortzimur,</HI> where we were very ill at ea&s;e being cold Weather and the Place not able to &s;upply us with Hou&s;e-room.</P>
<P>The next day leaving <HI>Hortzimur</HI> we travailed thr&ocirc; a very dry and barren Heath, meeting by the way with &s;om Robbers, who being but few in number dur&s;t not make any attempt upon us: However night coming upon us here, we were fain to &s;et down on the Heath, and for fear of Robbers forced to watch all night, but were &s;o be|nummed with cold that we many times wi&s;hed for break of day.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="187">On the fir&s;t of the next Moneth we came into a litle City called <HI>Senkan,</HI> which is reputed the be&s;t Refre&s;hing place between <HI>Derbent</HI> and <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> there being plenty of Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegra|nats, Melons, divers &s;orts of huge Grapes and many other Fruits then out of &s;ea&s;on. Veal and Mutton was here very cheap, as al&s;o Bread. Thus finding Provi&s;ion here very cheap, we bought what we thought nece&s;&s;ary. As for the City it &s;elf there is not much worthy of Remark about it, &s;ave onely a very fair and beautifull <HI>Metzid.</HI> It is &s;ituated in a Plain, and a flat Ground, but near the Town very barren and dry. It has been formerly a great Emporium, and flou|ri&s;hed more than 4 Centuries of years in Traffic and Commerce with the circumjacent Countreys, but &s;ince it was demoli&s;hed by the great <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> is &s;o run to decay, that it is out of Hopes, ever to arrive to it's pri&s;tin State.</P>
<P>On the 2 of <HI>Decemb.</HI> we &s;et forward and came in good time to <HI>Sul|tanie,</HI> a City lying in 36 <HI>degr.</HI> and 30 <HI>min.</HI> Northerly Latitude.

<P>On the 19 we betook our &s;elvs to our Journey, and that day tra|vailed about 24 [<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>] Miles, over a high, but level way, coming towards night to the great <HI>Carawan&s;era</HI> called <HI>Cho&s;keru.</HI> This is a very commodious and large Inn, built altogether of &s;quare &s;tones, within is a &s;pacious Court where was a Fountain of very good Water: the Rooms and Appartments were no le&s;s commodious.

Be&s;ides the many rare Fruits and Plants they have, there is an excellent &s;ort of Melons, having the outward form and colour of an Orange, and is oftentimes taken for one, but being cut up appears within as another Melon. The&s;e they commonly carry in the Hand for the delicate

They have al&s;o an odd kind of Cucumber about 18 or 20 Inches long but &s;mall, which they pickle much after the manner we do ours, and u&s;e'em for Sauce. They have al&s;o the common &s;ort of Melons which we com|monly call Mu&s;k-millions, that far &s;urpa&s;s ours for Delicacy. <HI>Khom</HI> is a place very con&s;iderable in regard of Traffic this being eminent for Swords, Knives, Armorers and Cutlers Works.

<P>On the South and South-we&s;t &s;ide it is watered with the <HI>Senderut,</HI> a rea&s;onable great River ri&s;ing from the <HI>Demawend</HI> Mountains, which coming here is led thr&ocirc; the Town by Pipes and Subterranean Aqueducts, for Kitchin and other u&s;es, alth&ocirc; in Gardens and Gentle|mens Hou&s;es they have Fountains apart.

this Aquaeduct were more than a 1000 Men continually at Work, each Man having about 7^d <HI>&s;terl.</HI> a day wages, yet what with the Violence of unu&s;ual Floods, and what with the Forreign Warrs in which this Prince was involved, the work was totally laid a&s;ide after a 3 Mo|neths labour. But the <HI>Chans,</HI> and Deputies who were more at lei&s;ure, &s;eeing the work &s;o detarded joyntly lent their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to carry on this laudable De&s;ign, in which they &s;aw the King took &s;o much de|light, maintaining &s;o many Men at their proper Expences. The Difficulty they met with was un&s;peakably great, having hard Rocks of Flint and Marble to cut thr&ocirc;, be&s;ides much ri&s;ing and falling Ground, which they had to make aequal. But the work being brought within 600 Paces of the Town the King died, and his Succe&s;&s;or, who&s;e inclinations were quite of another &s;train, had no mind to fini&s;h it in&s;omuch that it remains &s;till as it was when <HI>Schach Abas</HI> died.</P>
<P>The Streets of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> were formerly very wide, but when the abovementioned <HI>Abas,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> removed the Imperial Throne from <HI>Ca&s;win</HI> hither, he was followed by &s;o many Gentry and others that had their Appendency from the Court, that whole Rows of Hou&s;es were built in the middle of every Street, making by that one Street into 2.

<P>On the 23 of <HI>January</HI> was a great Match which I had the Fortune to &s;ee. It was appointed at the Interce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>U&s;bec</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador by the King who was him&s;elf pre&s;ent, and was mounted on a &s;tately <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;e richly cappari&s;on'd, for the Sadle and Saddle-cloth were very richly embroydered and &s;o thick be&s;et with Rubies and other Precious Stones that one could hardly view it. The Court and Royal Retinue were al&s;o well mounted and appeard very &s;plendid. When they were ready to try their Dexterity one went up to the Top, and &s;et up a Cup of Gold, which who could hit and bring it down, &s;hould not only have it for his Pains, but al&s;o be preferred to great Honour, and take place among the Prince&s;s of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> The King gave the <HI>Tartars</HI> the Advantage of &s;hooting fir&s;t who after they had &s;hot more than an hour, were fain to give over: for it was to be don on Hor&s;e back, and the Hor&s;e in a full carier, and furthermore not to &s;hoot till they came to a certain Place where they had the ma&s;t directly on the left &s;ide. The Amba&s;&s;ador &s;eeing that none of his men were &s;o dexterous gave over, and de&s;ired the King that he would vouch&s;afe to try the &s;kill of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Upon which the King orde|red certain Per&s;ons, who, without doubt, were very expert Marks|men, to ride in a circle, one for one, where the third that &s;hot had the Fortune to bring it down, upon which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> gave a &s;hout that the Palace rang again. Upon this he was &s;ent for by the King and brought into the Palace with as much Triumph as if he had won &s;om &s;ignal Victory; the Cup, Bow, and Quivers were like Tro|phys carried before him, by certain Heraulds thereto appointed, and he him&s;elf alth&ocirc; but a poor Mans Son of <HI>Keylan,</HI> promoted to great honour and reckoned in the Degree of a <HI>Chan.</HI> Be&s;ides this the King gave him a con&s;iderable Pen&s;ion out of the Tre&s;ury to maintain his Grandour.</P>
<P>On the South &s;ide of the <HI>Maydan</HI> is a very &s;tately <HI>Me&s;tzid</HI> which was founded and begun by <HI>Schach Abas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Met|zid <HI>of</HI> Schach Abas <HI>de|&s;cribed.</HI></NOTE> but fini&s;hed by <HI>Sephy</HI> his Nephew, who dedicated it to Twelve Saints, which are all inclu|ded under the name of <HI>Mehedi,</HI> and, as their Hi&s;torians affirm, were all buried in one Grave.

a great Stone Bath where every one that will enter the &s;aid Temple is fir&s;t obliged to wa&s;h. Leaving this Pa&s;&s;age you go up two Stepps which leads you into a broad Plain, and about 8 hundred Foot directly for|ward another &s;tep which brings you into the Church. The Gate which enters the <HI>Me&s;quite</HI> is of fair Marble and about as high as that of the <HI>Me&s;chaich</HI> of <HI>Choddabende</HI> in <HI>Sultanie.</HI> The Doors of this Temple are laid ore with Silver Plates, and &s;et in with Flowers of Gold. Entring within the Gate, you com into a pompous Antichamber, the Floor whereof is be&s;pred with very fine Matts, upon which they fall down on their Knees, and make a &s;hort prayer. From hence on each hand is a &s;tately Gallery, each leading into another &s;pacious Court, having in the middle a great Fountain, with a Bath. Above the&s;e great Galleries are &s;om le&s;s, which are &s;upported by marble Pillars, the Chapters and Foliage whereof are neatly gilded.

On the right hand at going out of this Church, you enter thr&ocirc; an Arch into a magnificent Hall, where &s;tands a Pulpit and an Altar, which &s;aid place, for &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s and uniformity of &s;tructure, is reputed the mo&s;t co&s;tly Building and mo&s;t glorious Fabric in the whole <HI>Emarath.</HI> All the Marble where|of it is built, &s;eeming to outvy the Snow its &s;elf for whitene&s;s, is brought hither, not without va&s;t trouble and Charges, from the Moun|tains of <HI>Elivend.</HI></P>

at night, by 15 Halberdiers: and in the Bed-Chamber of the King 30 young Gentlemen, being mo&s;tly the Sons of great Per&s;onages; in whom the King repo&s;es mo&s;t Confidence. Every night the <HI>Ki|&s;chiktzchi,</HI> or Captain of the Guards, brings the King a Li&s;t of their Names; who are to &s;tand upon the Ward the night following. With|in the Palace are &s;everal great Halls or Appartments, among&s;t which the <HI>Tabchane</HI> and the <HI>Diwan-Chane</HI> are the chiefe&s;t: The former being the Banquetting Hou&s;e, and the latter the Court of Ju&s;tice. In the <HI>Diwan-Chane</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors are always received and thence introducted into the Chamber of Audience, the more becau&s;e the Glory of the Cavalcade and other Solemnities can be here the better &s;een. Another Appartment which is not much inferior to tho&s;e already made men|tion of, is the <HI>Haram-Chane,</HI> where the King diverts him&s;elf with his Wives and Concubines. The <HI>Dekay</HI> is the Place where the King retires, and has his Re&s;idence, when not ingaged in any important Affair, holding here his Table with his legitimat Wives. In &s;hort there are many other Appartments within the Palace for inferior Con|cerns. Behind the Palace is a Garden which they call the <HI>Chobbadar</HI>; in the middle whereof is a beautifull little Chappel. Here is al&s;o the great Sanctuary, or Place of Refuge, which they call <HI>Allycarpi,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Gods Gate</HI>; in which Place a Malefactor is free from Ju&s;tice. There is al&s;o another &s;uch Place of Refuge, on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Maydan,</HI> called <HI>Tzechil Sutun,</HI> &s;o called from 40 huge ma&s;&s;y Beams that re&s;t upon one Pillar &s;tanding in the middle, and &s;o &s;upport the Roof.

<P>On the North &s;ide of the <HI>Maydan,</HI> are many Taverns and Tap|hou&s;es, and among tho&s;e a Hou&s;e greatly frequented by Traders, called the <HI>Tzaychatti-Chane</HI> or Thee-hou&s;e, which they prepare quite after another manner than the <HI>Indians,</HI> of whom the <HI>Europeans</HI> fir&s;t had it; for here they put in &s;o many aromatical Ingredients, that one can neither perceiv any Ta&s;te or Smell of Tee in it.

<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide about <HI>Dowlet-Chane</HI> are all the Sooth-&s;ayers, of which there be two &s;orts, to wit, <HI>Remal</HI> and <HI>Falkir,</HI> both which are in their practi&s;e more ridiculous than our circumventing Gyp&s;ies, and con&s;e|quently not worth my Pains to recount, nor the Readers Patience to hear of 'em.</P>
<P>In going from the <HI>Maydan</HI> to the Northward you find a way which leads you to the <HI>Ba&s;an,</HI> where is a very &s;tately <HI>Kay&s;erie,</HI> full of Shops and tho&s;e &s;tored with very rich commodities. This Market con&s;i&s;ts in a certain number of Streets, that are mo&s;tly arched over. Hither repair Merchants of all Nations, except <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> alone, as <HI>Indians, Tar|tars, Turks, Armenians, Georgians,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Engli&s;h, French, Italians, Hollanders</HI> and other <HI>Europeans.</HI> Their way of Dealing is altogether for Money, nothing by Barter. <HI>Abas</HI> is the mo&s;t plentifull coin in u&s;e among them, valuing &s;omthing le&s;s than an [<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>] Shilling, and the <HI>Schach Abas</HI> which is half the value of the other; the latter is al&s;o mo&s;tly called <HI>Choddabende.</HI> They do not u&s;e much Gold, but abun|dance of Copper which they call <HI>Pull,</HI> 40 of which Pieces make an <HI>Abas.</HI> The <HI>Europeans</HI> who com thither bring commonly Rix-dollars, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> once getting into their Hands will by no means part with them, for they are diligently &s;ought up by the Money-changers, who bring them to the <HI>Serab-Chane,</HI> or Mint, and make a con&s;iderable profit of them.</P>

from all Countreys in the World, &s;o that above all other Vocations the Inn-keepers generally thrive the be&s;t, and by their great doings accommodate all Per&s;ons to their full Content: The <HI>Carawan&s;eras</HI> here are more &s;umptuous by far than either tho&s;e of <HI>Ca&s;win,</HI> or any other City in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> They are for the mo&s;t part &s;quare, &s;om of them having 4 or 5 Galleries abov one another, and tho&s;e furni&s;hed with very commodious Appartments, and for their better Security for Theeves are &s;urrounded with high Stone Walls.</P>
<P>In <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> are al&s;o many fair Buildings, be&s;ides what are already remembred, among&s;t which the <HI>Taberik Kale,</HI> or Fort Royal where the Kings Tre&s;ury is, is one of the mo&s;t eminent, &s;ituated between the Palace and the <HI>Me&s;tzid Mehedi,</HI> which is both munited with &s;trong Walls, guarded continually with a &s;ufficient Body of Soldiery, and has plenty of Bra&s;s Cannon. The &s;ame al&s;o &s;erves for a Magazin or Re|po&s;itory of Armory. There are al&s;o two fair Chri&s;tian Mona&s;teries, the one for the <HI>Carmelites</HI> and the other for <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> Monks.</P>
<P>The&s;e with many other fair Buildings, too taedious to recount, are within the Walls. There are al&s;o many &s;plendid Piles of Buil|dings without in the Suburbs, which they call the <HI>Rhabath.</HI> In the Suburbs are two eminent Wards, to wit, <HI>Tzulfa</HI> and <HI>Ciulfa,</HI> mo&s;tly, or altogether inhabited by the <HI>Armenian</HI> Chri&s;tians, who are reputed the able&s;t Merchants in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> being tran&s;ported hither by <HI>Schach Abas</HI> from their own Countrey, and have &s;ince injoyed &s;undry Im|munities, and have a Governour of their own, which they call <HI>Da|ruga</HI> who mu&s;t bring up 200 <HI>Tumain</HI> yearly contribution to the King, which is taken out of their Public Stock. The private Dwelling-Hou&s;es of tho&s;e <HI>Armenians</HI> do equal, or rather &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e within Walls for &s;plendid &s;tructure. On the one &s;ide of the River <HI>Senderut</HI> is another Place, called <HI>Tabri</HI>- or <HI>Abas-Sabath</HI> for that <HI>Schach Abas</HI> had allotted the People of <HI>Tabris</HI> this Part of the Town to dwell in&punc; Another Ward, or Quarter of the Suburbs is called <HI>Ha&s;&s;enabath,</HI> which is mo&s;tly inhabited by the <HI>Georgian</HI> Chri&s;tians, commonly called <HI>Trurtzi,</HI> The&s;e as well as the <HI>Armenians</HI> are great Merchants, being al&s;o highly in favour with the King, not only for the va&s;t Tribute which they pay, but a&s;wel for their Loyalty and good deportment: and the&s;e are the only Chri&s;tians who are tolerated to live within the Walls, and have a Quarter of the Town allotted them near the <HI>Me&s;t|zid

Mehedi,</HI> alth&ocirc; they rather chu&s;e to dwell in the Suburbs, that they may be retire from the Calumny of the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and the better enjoy the Benefits of a Chri&s;tian Society. The <HI>Kebrabath</HI> is a Di&s;trict of the Suburbs lying on the We&s;t &s;ide of the City, &s;o called from the <HI>Kebbers,</HI> which are a &s;ort of ancient <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Pagans, who following the old opinion of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> when they were yet Heathens, will not embrace <HI>Mahometani&s;m.</HI> The&s;e differ from the re&s;t in Habit, as well as in Cu&s;toms and Religion, wearing loo&s;e Drawers, with a long Coat only fa&s;tned at the Collar, open at the &s;houlders: Their Hair they let grow, all over their Head and Face. The Women are attired as the Men only with this difference, that they wear a long Silk or Cotton Scarf which trails on the Ground. The Language they &s;peak is &s;till the ancient <HI>Lingua Per&s;ica,</HI> for they are very curious in pre&s;erving their ancient Tongue without any Innovation, in&s;omuch that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> who &s;peak the modern Language cannot under&s;tand them [as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> cannot under&s;tand the old <HI>Britti&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Wel&s;h</HI>] yet the&s;e can both under&s;tand and &s;peak the pre&s;ent <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue. They retain al&s;o the Ancient Characters, and adore the Sun and the Elements for De&iuml;ties performing Monethly Sacrifices. Be&s;ides the veneration they have for the Sun, they do wor&s;hip to the Starrs, but have little or no Judgement in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame. Snakes and all other venemous Animals they hold for unclean, &s;o that who&s;o|ever touches any of tho&s;e, whether voluntarily, or by accident, mu&s;t not enter into their Temples till he be purified. Their Dead they do not burn as mo&s;t Pagans do, but when any Per&s;on dies, whether it be an Infant, or one com to full growth and Maturity, they wa&s;h the Body very clean, and carry it to a Place far di&s;tant from any Hou|&s;es, and there &s;et it upright again&s;t a Po&s;t, where they wait till the Ravens com and pick out the one Eie, which if it be the right Eie, they are of opinion that the Soul of the Departed is in Paradi&s;e, and therefore interr him very decently; but if the Bird pull out his left Eie fir&s;t, then they hold it for a &s;ure Token, that he is damned, and for his wicked Life to &s;uffer perpetual Torments, and therefore e&s;teem him not worthy of &s;uch &s;olemn Exequies, but ca&s;t him head-long into a deep Pit.</P>
<P>Without the City of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> are many fair Gardens and Summer-hou&s;es, belonging to the King and divers great Per&s;onages. The
<PB N="324" REF="201">
mo&s;t eminent of all the&s;e is the <HI>Tzarbag,</HI> not far from the great Bridge, being 4 &s;quare, and about 2 [<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>] Miles in circuit. This (as was &s;aid before) is watered with an Aquaeduct that is conveyed under Ground by &s;everal &s;mall leaden Pipes from the Main, and here and there vented by Fountains, which force the Water &s;omtimes 36 or 40 foot high. On each corner &s;tands a noble Summer Hou&s;e, of an admirable rare Fabric. The Garden it's &s;elf has the mo&s;t and greate&s;t varieties of Fruit-Trees and Vegetables that ever I have &s;een, alth&ocirc; it was then Winter when I was there. And indeed the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are great Lovers of Planting, Gardening, and all manner of Tillage; &s;o that there is hardly a Hou&s;e in all <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> but has &s;omthing of a Garden behind it, more or le&s;s, whence it coms that this City is &s;o great in compa&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the manner of their Hous-keeping and other peculiar Cu|&s;toms, I hold it needle&s;s to treat any thing about, &s;ince it may be collected out of what I have already &s;aid in the foregoing Chapters. They are in general very &s;ociable, and for their Urbanity towards &s;trangers, draw many Forreigners thither. They are al&s;o Lovers of all kinds of Di&s;cipline, and the Gentry very ambitious in Arts and Sciences. The Land about <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is very fertile, and affoards all that is nece&s;&s;ary for human &s;u&s;tenance in good plenty. But the Town being very populous thr&ocirc; the great concour&s;e of Strangers from all parts of the World makes all things very dear, but e&s;pecially Fewel, in&s;omuch that Wood and Charcoal are &s;old by the Pound, and not|with&s;tanding it may &s;eem to be in a warm climat, yet in the Winter it is very cold, or at le&s;t &s;o &s;eeming to them, who are u&s;ed to the great heat of the Summer Sol&s;tice. During the time of my being there they were very bu&s;y about gathering their Ice, which is got and pre&s;erved after this manner: Fir&s;t they dig a great Pit in the Earth, about 40 Foot deep, which they encompa&s;s with a Wall, about 10 Fathom high which is commonly made of Clay, but that &s;ide next to the North is lower than the re&s;t, that the cool North Winds may allay the violent Heat of the Sun: then they dig or plow certain furrows in the Plains round about, which when it freezes, they &s;et all over with Water, and &s;o gather the Ice, and when they have enough cover it with &s;traw. This Ice is very common in u&s;e among the richer &s;ort in the Summer time, not only for cooling the Wines,
<PB N="325" REF="201">
but a&s;well for lying upon their Di&s;hes of Fruit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>FEB.</HI> 1672.</NOTE> when they are brought up to the Table, which is only laid on a heap in the middle of the Di&s;h, and &s;o di&s;&s;olves it &s;elf, through all the Fruit. This is reckoned for a good commodity if it be a hot Summer, and is &s;old as well along the Streets, as in Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>On the 16 of <HI>February,</HI> was the Epiphany celebrated by the <HI>Arme|nian</HI> and <HI>Georgian</HI> Chri&s;tians. So &s;oon as I heard what was the matter, I ro&s;e pretty early in the morning with intent to &s;ee the Solemnity of the Day. The fir&s;t I met was the <HI>Je&s;aulcor,</HI> or Great Mar&s;hal with all his &s;ubordinat Officers, who were ordered to prevent Tumults, and not to &s;uffer Hor&s;es and Camels with any Burthens to pa&s;s over the Bridges and thr&ocirc; the Streets that lead to <HI>Tzulfa</HI> and <HI>Tzarbag</HI>; which was not only don for the &s;ake of the Chri&s;tians, but upon the account of one of the Kings legitimat Wives, whom he entirely loved, being a <HI>Georgian</HI> by birth and educated in the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, and had a de&s;ire to go and &s;ee the Solemnities performed, which the King would not deny her, for that &s;he was great with Child. About 8 in the morning were all the Chri&s;tian Ladies in Balconies, which were all hung with Tape&s;try, and tho&s;e of the greate&s;t rank with Canopies over head. Tho&s;e of meaner degree &s;ate on each &s;ide the River <HI>Senderus,</HI> and had a Guard of Soldiers under the Command of an Officer, to &s;ecure them from being abu&s;ed by the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and to &s;uffer no Men to crowd in upon them. About 9 a&s;&s;embled all tho&s;e under Spiritual Orders and the Clergy belonging to the 10 Churches of <HI>Tzulpha,</HI> and the 2 Churches of <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> Tho&s;e were all attired in white Stoles and Capps of Cloth of Gold upon their Heads, with long Labels hanging down to their middle, but more gorgeous was the Attire of the Patriarch, being all over richly embroydered with Gold and adorned with co&s;tly Gems. Every Prie&s;t carried a Silver Cro&s;s hung with litle Silver Bells and Ba&s;ons. The Cro&s;&s;es which were carried by tho&s;e of higher degrees and in the formo&s;t Ranks were &s;upported, each by 3 Men. The Inferior Clergy fol|lowed after with lighted Tapours in their Hands, accompanied with the mo&s;t eminent of the La&iuml;ty. The Superior Monks of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> adjoyned them&s;elvs to the Patriarch, 5 of them bearing up his Pon|tifical Robes, 2 on each &s;ide and one behind. About one a clock came the King mounted on a &s;tately <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;e, without any con|&s;iderable
<PB N="326" REF="202">
Retinu &s;ave only the Chancelor and Grand Mar&s;hal, the the Guards and the re&s;t of the Court having order to keep behind the Proce&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Begum,</HI> or Queen before mentioned was carried before as a privat Gentlewoman in a Sedan to a great Merchants hou&s;e, accompany'd only with one Gentlewoman, the Ma&s;ter of the Eu|nuchs and 4 of his Company: for the King ever repo&s;es great Con|fidence in the Chri&s;tians, and e&s;teems them as the mo&s;t loyal of all his Subjects, as appears by his adventuring his per&s;on among them, without any Guards. But before the Proce&s;&s;ion was ended it began to &s;now very hard, which did not only cau&s;e the King to leav them but put a &s;top to the further Celebration of this great Fe&s;tival, which, by the preparations, &s;eemed to be intended to be &s;olemnized with very great Pomp: for be&s;ides the Contribution of all the Chri|&s;tians, who, as I have el&s;ewhere noted, are very rich, the King &s;ends the Patriarch a con&s;iderable Sum of Money &s;om time before, in order to the carrying on and maintaining this anniver&s;ary Cu&s;tom. The Patriarch and Superior Clergy &s;eeing there was no hopes of the Weather growing better, they departed without performing the ritual Ceremonies: but the La&iuml;ty continued Dancing and Singing all the Night long.</P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>Caravan</HI> was in a readine&s;s to depart for <HI>Gam|meron,</HI> and the Heer <HI>Bent</HI> gave order for Hor&s;es and Camels to be bought up for us, to carry our Provi&s;ion and Baggage. He al&s;o took care to buy us all Nece&s;&s;aries we had occa&s;ion for on our Journey and was plea&s;ed to appoint me as <HI>Caffil Aba&s;si,</HI> or Over&s;eer of the Provi|&s;ion. About this time it fro&s;e very hard, and as I not without won|dring &s;aw Ice 3 Foot thick, which was averred never to be known in that Countrey in any mans Age. How hard a &s;ea&s;on it was for poor People may be gathered from what I have already &s;aid how &s;carce all kind of Fewel is is <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>

<P>ON the 17 of <HI>February</HI> we had order to make ready for our Jour|ney,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>FEB.</HI> 1672.</NOTE> wherefore that morning I went to return my hearty Thanks to my good Ma&s;ter, <HI>Hadzi Byram,</HI> where coming and finding him at home I &s;aluted him after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> manner, withall manife&s;ting my gratefullne&s;s to him for his many Favours, which he had &s;hown me, alth&ocirc; without the le&s;t de&s;erts; but he interpelling me in my di&s;|cour&s;e, forbad me to talk any more of that, &s;aying, <HI>I have not yet him &s;o worthy as to give you the Reward I promi&s;ed you: which was to &s;et you free when you came to</HI> I&s;pahan, <HI>and now I under&s;tand you have redeemed your &s;elf with your own Money: however I &s;hall make it good to you by an Equi|valent.</HI> With that he opened a Che&s;t and gave me 100 Dollars, &s;aying, This I give you as part of Reward, for your care to &s;ave my life when I was in danger of loo&s;ing it at the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. This extraordinary great Bounty coming &s;o be&s;ides my expectation, put me to a &s;tand what reply to make at fir&s;t, but con&s;idering how he might look upon it as an Ingratitude to be &s;ilent, I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf after this manner, <HI>Sir, I am not able ever to do you &s;uch &s;ervice as may recompen&s;e your Good|ne&s;s, but I hope that</HI> GOD <HI>will remember your Bounty don in &s;ecret, which is the true&s;t Charity, notwith&s;tanding the unworthine&s;s of my &s;elf on whom it is &s;hown.</HI> Great rea&s;on it is that I &s;hould record the worthy Deeds of this <HI>Turki&s;h Chri&s;tian</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian Turk:</HI> not only as don to me, but as don to one of another Faith, and that without vain Glory, a thing he ever hated: his calling me a&s;ide and forbidding me to make it known, manife&s;t the Ab&s;olutene&s;s and Integrity of Charity, well knowing that I was ju&s;t upon my departure, and con&s;equently not

likely to be his Trumpeter: but the more he charged me to conceal it the more I reckon it my Office to publi&s;h it, that Chri&s;tians who&s;e fir&s;t and chief Duty towards their Neighbour is Charity, and that the remi&s;sne&s;s of that Duty may be convinced by tho&s;e who hold it as a voluntary and not an injoyned Act. In &s;um his fair Carriage towards me, unfortunately thrown from a Condition of Freedom to a State of Slavery, had &s;o far ingaged me to love and honour him, that (had it not been for the Re&s;triction and Care of a Wife and Children who lived all this time as Widdow and Orphans) I could have bin more content to &s;erv him all my Life as a Slave, than to have the Li|berty which I have before and &s;ince enjoyed, with &s;uch Anxiety. When, with a faint Heart and Eies full of Tears, I took my la&s;t leav of him he embraced me, and told me he had yet hopes to &s;ee me once again, and when I was at a di&s;tance, cried out, GOD <HI>in the highe&s;t Heavens conduct you:</HI> GOD <HI>Almighty bring you in &s;afety home</HI>: which were the la&s;t words I heard him &s;peak.</P>

<P>On the 18 it was very cold weather and &s;nowy, that we could hard|ly keep a Hor&s;eback.

<P>Upon the 22 we &s;et forward again and had very hilly way, which

This it &s;eems put him into &s;uch Con&s;ternation as well as his Companions, that he dur&s;t not appear abroad to challenge me for any injury don him, fearing, perhaps, upon my addre&s;s to the Deputy that they would be &s;ecured till further Information: nor did I ever &s;ee him &s;ince.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the gentle Reception and the great kindne&s;s the&s;e Friars &s;howd me, I was kindly treated by one Doctor <HI>Robin,</HI> a <HI>French-man,</HI> which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> called <HI>Hakim Robin,</HI> for <HI>Hakim</HI> in their Tongue is as much as to &s;ay Doctor: but his fir&s;t name I cannot remember.

<P><HI>Scyras</HI> as mo&s;t other Towns in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> lies in a Valley, environed on every &s;ide with Hills. On that &s;ide towards <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> is only one Thorowfare or Pa&s;&s;age, which is laid ore with an Arch all over painted with variety of Bea&s;ts and Animals, and in&s;cribed in &s;everal Places with <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Rhymes and Mottos. When one is pa&s;&s;ed thr&ocirc; the &s;aid Arch is a fair and &s;pacious &s;treet, which leads to the City, being plain, wide, eaven, and planted on each &s;ide with Trees [like the Palmal in <HI>Saint James's</HI> Park] which with the great number of Gentlemens Hou&s;es on each &s;ide renders it as an amiable Paradi&s;e. At the end of the way is a &s;till &s;tanding pool or pond, which is drawn off with a Trench on each &s;ide: having pa&s;t this we come over a Plain or Flat field, and ju&s;t before the Gates of the City to a great long Stone-bridge which lies over a Ditch, which in the Sum|mer time is dry, but in the Winter gives the Inhabitants work enough to keep it in with damming, for &s;omtimes when it &s;nows and the Water falling unexpectedly from the Mountains it overflows the whole champain Land, between the afore&s;aid Pool and the Ditch, is a little Chappel founded by a <HI>Carmelite</HI> Friar, which is often vi&s;ited by the Chri&s;tians that live in <HI>Scyras.</HI> The <HI>Maydan</HI> or Market of <HI>Scyras</HI> is with|out the Walls, which they &s;ay is by rea&s;on that this Place is of great Importance and in danger of being &s;urprized or taken in by the Boors that live without the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Juri&s;diction, who have more than once attempted to make them&s;elvs Ma&s;ters of the Town and Fort. On each &s;ide the Town appear the Ruins of Old Walls, Gates, Towers, Pillars and other great Buildings, which is a fair argu|ment that <HI>Scyras</HI> has bin formerly much larger than it is now at this day, which is neverthele&s;s a Town of con&s;ideration, in re&s;pect of the pre&s;ent Trade and number of Inhabitants. The greate&s;t part of the City Walls are of Marble, for that is there in greater plenty than Fri&s;e [or <HI>Portland</HI>] Stone with us: but as for the Streets they are nei|ther fair nor &s;pacious, but void of elegant building and uniformity of &s;tructure, and by rea&s;on that they lie unpav'd very foul and hardly to be pa&s;&s;ed in bad and rainy Weather.

Within it appears with great magnificency, and is very well ordained as to it's &s;tructure and Order of Colums; in the middle is a Chore, or Quire, which receives it's light from a Lanthorn or Tower of Gla&s;s above. The next remarka|ble Temple is that of <HI>Aga Riza</HI> a very rich <HI>Indian</HI> Merchant who founded it at his proper Charges and left a con&s;iderable &s;um to erect him a Tomb at the Ea&s;t and thereof. There is a very fair <HI>Ba&s;ar</HI> round about with rich Shops and many Galleries. There is al&s;o an Academy which may take place with the be&s;t public Edifices about Town, in which are taught the Literature there in u&s;e, be&s;ides variety of other di&s;cipline and &s;ciences.

<P>The Land round about <HI>Scyras</HI> is very fertile, produces great plenty of Corn and Fruit, but abov all is eminent for the rich Vineyards; in&s;omuch that this Place and Countrey has got the name beyond all the Provinces in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> for delicate Wine, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing not only the Candian and Canary-Wines but all the Wines in the World for a delicate ta&s;t, reli&s;h, and flavor. From hence the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and all the great Per&s;onages at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> have their Wine, and hither repair the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> to market: nay, &s;uch is the e&s;teem thereof, that notwith&s;tanding the great abundance of the yearly product, it is as dear here as <HI>Canary</HI> Sack in the <HI>Low-Countreys.</HI> This Trade in Wines which they of <HI>Scyras</HI> have is at pre&s;ent &s;o con&s;iderable that there is not &s;o much as half an Acre together of wa&s;t ground, or hardly im|ployed in any other u&s;e, for the Vineyards com &s;o clo&s;e to the Town that one may throw a &s;tone from the Walls into them. Such ground as is not proper to nouri&s;h the vine they convert to Orchard u&s;e, and have many fair Arborets or Nur&s;eries for young Fruit-Trees of all &s;orts, which are tran&s;ported hence to other Places, the Fruit of this Countrey being nothing inferior to their Wines.

<P>The next day it blew hard and was intermixed with &s;howers of Rain, &s;o that we had very bad travailing and almo&s;t wearied out.

any thing to the contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>JUN.</HI> 1673.</NOTE> but that it was &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own Nation, and were &s;ent out to convoy their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships howeward: but coming into the Bay were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, that they were &s;a|luted with Balls in &s;tead of loo&s;e Powder. However the <HI>English</HI> were re&s;olved to com a&s;hoar &s;om way or other, for they were de&s;titute of Water, all the 7 Ships of War and the Merchant-men with the Fire Ship hardly able to make out 15 Hog&s;heads of Water, and were be&s;ides that at a great lo&s;s for Refre&s;hments, having been long off at Sea to and again. The Admiral therefore gave command to attempt an entrance at the South &s;ide of the I&s;land, where it was &s;o narrow that they could not go abov 4 in a rank, in&s;omuch that if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> could have mi&s;&s;ed &s;o many men out of the Fort, might have knockt them all down with Stones, with 50 or 60 Men, &s;o that the <HI>English</HI> invaded the I&s;land unmole&s;ted. The Governour &s;eeing that they were &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and he unable to defend him&s;elf again&s;t &s;o great a Power, &s;ur|rendred upon Articles and Compo&s;ition. This was the Relation of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>On the 4 of <HI>June</HI> the <HI>English</HI> got two Ships more of the 5 that fol|lowed us with another coming from <HI>Ceylon,</HI> who, not knowing any thing to the contrary but that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;till Ma&s;ters of the I&s;land, came &s;ailing without any dread directly thither from the Cape. For the <HI>English</HI> had planted the Princes Flag aloft, and a Red Flag on the High way, which was a privat Token that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had among them&s;elves. When I remarked what the meaning of all this was, and how ea&s;ily our Ships would be deceived, I went to the Shore, where I e&s;pied the Ships not abov half a <HI>Dutch</HI> league di&s;tant, and immediatly pulled of my Shirt and &s;et it upon a Stick, that at le&s;t they might begin, if they &s;hould have the Fortune to &s;ee it, to con&s;ider well with them&s;elvs, what &s;uch might import; but it &s;eemed that they took no notice of it, or el&s;e did not &s;ee it, otherwi&s;e it had bin time enough for them to have &s;cap'd the Scouring. 'Twas not long before I was &s;pied by two <HI>English</HI> Sentinels, who came in all ha&s;t, and beat me after a mo&s;t lamentable manner: which when they had don brought me before the Governour, who asked me, what I meant by that Token, I told him with great liberty, <HI>That I thought it my duty to warn my Nation from the Peril which they were ready to run in, and that I &s;uppo&s;ed that if, I had bin an</HI> Engli&s;hman <HI>and had

Whence we may learn what difference there is, between drinking at the Fountain, and drinking at the Current.</P>
<P>Mean while the Ships came on undauntedly; and were hardly &s;ail|ed within the Bay, but de&s;cryed a <HI>Lyon</HI> in an <HI>A&s;&s;es Skin,</HI> in &s;tead of an <HI>A&s;s</HI> in a <HI>Lions Skin,</HI> and di&s;cerned a Wolfs Body with a Sheeps Voice, the Colours they &s;aw &s;poke good <HI>Dutch,</HI> but the Ships danced an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Jig, wherefore they thought it be&s;t to tack about and make all the &s;ail they could: which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> perceiving, out after them all in a Body, and took the Admiral and Vice-Admiral, but the Rere-Admiral and the other 2 made their E&s;cape, and could not be overtaken. The Admiral behaved him&s;elf with good courage, and had probably not bin taken if his Mizzin Peek had not bin brought by the board. The Ship that engaged and took him was the <HI>We&s;t-Freezlandt,</HI> being formerly a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship and taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the year .1665, and was now mounted with 54 Guns. Our Admiral would fain have boarded her but could not, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> poured ince&s;&s;antly upon them with &s;mall &s;hot, in&s;omuch that he was fain to yield, the Commander him&s;elf being wounded in the Leg.</P>

<P>ON the 28 of <HI>May</HI> we left <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI> and with a &s;mall Boat fell down the River <HI>Occa,</HI> till we came at <HI>Dedenof,</HI> being the Wharf where the Ship and Yacht were built which we found ready for a Launch.</P>
<P>ON the 6 of <HI>Iune</HI> we &s;et &s;ail with our Ship, and Yacht coming the day following before <HI>Ni&s;en Novogorod,</HI> where the River <HI>Occa</HI> incorporates with the <HI>Wolga.</HI> In the mean while we had run our &s;elvs a ground three or 4 Times, but that was more thr&ocirc; the un&s;kilfullne&s;s of the Pilot than the Badne&s;s of the River, which is deep and navigable: as al&s;o on each &s;ide inhabited and grown with Woods. The name of the Gentleman who re&s;ided at Ni&s;en as <HI>Waywood,</HI> or Governour, was <HI>Maxim Ivanowitz Nachokkin,</HI> who made us very welcom and according to their cu&s;tom &s;ent us &s;everal Di&s;hes of Meat, al&s;o during the time we lay there at Anchor came &s;everal times aboard us; and at our departure convoy'd us down &s;om part of the River, and &s;upplied the Officers with Nece&s;&s;aries and Refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>HAVING the advantage both of Wind and &s;tream we arrived the Fir&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> before the mouth of the River <HI>Ca&s;anka,</HI> which is about a mile from <HI>Ca&s;an.</HI> Here we broke our Cables, and with much ado made fa&s;t to the &s;hore with a &s;ingle Rope: We had al&s;o lo&s;t our Bow&s;priet among the Trees in falling down the <HI>Occa.</HI> The <HI>Waywods</HI> name of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> was <HI>Iurien Petrovitz Trobieskay,</HI> a liberal Gentle|man and not at all incomitable; he treated us &s;everal Times at his own Hou&s;e, and upon our Departure gave us &s;om Provi&s;ion aboard us. After 15 days aboad here we loo&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal fair Towns, as <HI>Camu&s;chinka, Do&s;oro&s;ka</HI> and others too long to relate. This &s;aid <HI>Camu&s;chinka</HI> is lately built by Order of the <HI>Czaar,</HI> being fortified Diamond wi&s;e by Collonel <HI>Thomas Bailey,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman: It's end is to prevent the Irruption of the <HI>Co&s;acs,</HI> the River <HI>Camu&s;chinka</HI> running into the <HI>Don.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 13 of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we got &s;ight of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> and on the 14 came before the Town where we gave the <HI>Salvo</HI> with all our Cannon and 60 Mu&s;quets, and in the Evening dropped Anchor in the Road, near the Town. We had before got Intelligence how that the <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> had appeared upon the <HI>Wolga,</HI> but coming to <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> were further informed how that the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> were gon out again&s;t them, in which Expedition were 50 Stroegs and about 3000 Men, under the Command of <HI>Knees Simeun Ivanowitz Geboof,</HI> who was the third Voyce, or &s;uffrage of

<HI>A&s;trachan.</HI> It is now 3 years &s;ince the fir&s;t ri&s;ing of the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> in which time they have depopulated many fair Towns upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and about a year agon had taken in <HI>Iaick,</HI> a City belonging to the <HI>Czar,</HI> where they had be&s;ides many In&s;olencies committed killed and di&s;patched abov 8000 Men by cruel and unheard- of Torments, among&s;t whom was one <HI>Dutch</HI> Officier, of known fame for his good Conduct.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they had taken in and demoli&s;hed 3 Citys, and mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly ma&s;|&s;acred the Inhabitants, and growing both in number and power were becom very formidable, both to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the Great Duke. They were headed by one <HI>Stenko</HI> (or <HI>Stephen) Radzin,</HI> a di&s;contented Per&s;on and one of great Power, as to his proper Abilities, bearing a Soveraign Aw among them. About 14 days before our Arrival at <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> he had taken a co&s;tly <HI>Per&s;ian Boes,</HI> valued at &s;everal Tuns of Gold, in which were Hor&s;es and &s;everal other Pre&s;ents &s;ent from the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the Great Duke of <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 17 as the <HI>Waywod</HI> of <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> was aboard our Ship came an Expre&s;s, bringing news that <HI>Radzin</HI> and the <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> had &s;ubmitted them&s;elvs to the Great Duke, upon which the <HI>Waywod</HI> gave order that we &s;hould fire our Guns, which we did. The &s;aid Letters further mentioned how that they had delivered the Hor&s;es belonging to the Great Duke to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> General.</P>
<P>ON the 19 came 3 <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> into <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> in very co&s;tly Attire and with great pomp, whereof the younge&s;t was the Orator. The <HI>Waywood</HI> after a long Treaty a&s;&s;ured them of being e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Great Dukes Favour. But it &s;eemed that they had &s;om di&s;gu&s;t, becau&s;e they were not formally introduced, as is cu&s;tomary with all Amba&s;&s;adors and Legates.
The <HI>Waywod</HI> excu&s;ed it, &s;aying 
<Q>That he him|&s;elf was a <HI>Bojar,</HI> and re&s;ided there in quality of <HI>Waywod,</HI> yet at his fir&s;t taking that Dignity upon him was not introducted by his Predece&s;&s;or, nor the Nobility of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> which was Argument and Token that he was not to do the like to others.</Q>
When the Conference was over, the <HI>Waywod</HI> invited them to his Hou&s;e and gave them a &s;plendid Treat.</P>
<P>ON the 21 early in the Morning came the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Fleet before the Town con&s;i|&s;ting of 53 <HI>Stroegs,</HI> or Rowing-Barks: upon each <HI>Stroeg</HI> was only one Piece of Ordnance, but tho&s;e in the Rere had 2, to wit, one before and another aba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Aboard each were &s;o many <HI>Strelitzers</HI> (which are the Soldiery) that they could not mov if there had bin occa&s;ion, to do any execution. The &s;aid Fleet by order of the <HI>Waywod</HI> came to Anchor on the other &s;ide of the River. About 3 in the Afternoon came the <HI>Co&s;acs,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in 23 Sail and a con&s;iderable number of Men. Upon their Arrival we had an order from the <HI>Waywod</HI> to receiv 200 <HI>Strelitzers</HI> aboard under our Standard, who placed them&s;elvs in order round about the Ship. The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army then loo&s;ed and came before the City, giving the <HI>Salvo</HI> with all their great Guns at once, with abov 3000 Mu&s;quets: which the <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> an&s;wered with their Cannons and Mu&s;quets; upon which they in the City put out a white Flag, which was a Token for us to Fire, which we did with all our great Guns, and about 200 Mu&s;quets. Mean while the Ma&s;ter of our Ship fell over board, but was taken up again, th&ocirc; with much ado, for the weather was a little tempe&s;tuous. Soon after
<PB N="363" REF="228">
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> gave fire a &s;econd time and came clo&s;e up to our Ship; upon which we gave fire for the la&s;t time with 13 Guns and 200 Mu&s;quets. The <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> rowed off, and came to Anchor where the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Fleet rode at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>ON the 22 in the Morning betimes, the <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> rowed up the River, and were on a &s;udden out of &s;ight: and that morning i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation that none &s;hould have any Commerce or Conver&s;e with them. On the 23 came <HI>Radzin</HI> him&s;elf in Per&s;on into <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> and was &s;aluted by all the Gentry: the <HI>Waywod</HI> was al&s;o council'd to bring the Ammunition and Standard of the Rebells into the City, which he re&s;olv'd upon. Mean while came news to the <HI>Waywod</HI> that <HI>Radzin</HI> was drunk, whereupon he gave order that they &s;hould endeavor by good and gentle words to get him out of Town: he being very unruly when overtaken with Liquor, in which mood he had de&s;troyed many Men, both of his own Rout and others. But the In&s;olencies he had committed during this Uproar cannot be recounted, alth&ocirc; 'tis &s;aid that be&s;ides the many Thou&s;ands of the Great Dukes Subjects he had cau&s;ed to be ma&s;|&s;acred, whereof him&s;elf boa&s;ted to have di&s;patched 8000 at one time, he had from time to time ma&s;&s;acred above 40000 <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>

<P>AFTER a taedious delay we finally received an Order from the Great Duke to imbark our &s;elvs with the Ships Company, and com to <HI>Mo&s;cou.</HI> Which being &s;hown us I in&s;i&s;ted continually that according to the &s;aid Order I might go up, but it was thought good that the Ship &s;hould be fir&s;t put in Equippage, and &s;up|plied with Ammunition, and in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity be u&s;ed again&s;t the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who under the Conduct of one <HI>Stenko Radzin</HI> as chief, had already depopulated many fair Countreys upon the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and then reconciled to the Great Duke. But in the Moneth of <HI>March</HI> came news how that the <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> were again revolted, upon which Colonel <HI>Levonti Bogdonof</HI> was di&s;patched by the Great Duke with a Band of 800 Men, to wit, 400 <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Cavalrie and 400 <HI>Nagaian Tartars,</HI> to march to <HI>Zarit a,</HI> a City lying about 80 <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles above <HI>A&s;trachan</HI>; that being a City which abutts upon the Frontiers of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and commands the pa&s;&s;age of the River <HI>Don,</HI> or <HI>Tanais</HI>; which River neverthele&s;s doth not fall into the <HI>Wolga,</HI> as &s;om have bin of opinion, and as mo&s;t Maps do make it, for the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> do come almo&s;t a days Journey with their Boats from the <HI>Don</HI> to the <HI>Wolga,</HI> which they bal|lance with pieces of Timber, the better to endure the violence of the &s;tream, for they are but of one entire piece, or Trunks of Trees hollowed out.

<P>ABOUT the 27, or 28 of <HI>April</HI> came a Narrativ by a Courier from the above|&s;aid <HI>Bogdanof,</HI> importing how that the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> had taken in <HI>Tzaritza,</HI> and that about 1200 <HI>Mo&s;covians</HI> were kill'd and drown'd: but to give a full account of the Stratagems they had u&s;ed to gain the Town, would make me more prolix and taedious than my pre&s;ent de&s;ign is to be. The&s;e 1200 <HI>Strelitzers</HI> or Soldiers, were a part of tho&s;e that were &s;ent from <HI>Mo&s;cou</HI> to enforce the re&s;pectiv Garri&s;ons upon the <HI>Wolga,</HI> but e&s;pecially this City, in which the Great Duke repo&s;ed great Tru&s;t, being able to check (as I have &s;aid before) the main Pa&s;&s;age of the Rebels, in their March for the South-Ea&s;t Countrey.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day came news how that the Field-<HI>Tartars</HI> were at di&s;cord and facti|ous among them&s;elvs, and being drawn into 2 Head-parties u&s;ed all manner of ho&s;tile

<P>MEANWHILE all things are made ready at <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> and the Shipping de&s;ign'd for &s;ervice in this Expedition put in equippage. The <HI>Waywood</HI> al&s;o &s;ends a Per&s;on of Quality with a Body of Soldiery to joyn with tho&s;e under <HI>Boogdanof</HI>: the&s;e were then to be commanded by a <HI>Pole,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Ivan Ru&s;&s;in&s;ki</HI> and a Pro&s;elyte in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Church, and next to him one <HI>James Wondrong,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentle|man, born in <HI>Edenburg,</HI> aged about 33 years, and univer&s;ally well &s;poken of, for his Piety and faithfull deportment.

<P>UPON the 25 of <HI>May</HI> being Munday in Whit&s;un-week the Captains departed from <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> in about 40 <HI>Stroegs,</HI> all under the command of <HI>Knees Simeun Iva|nowitz Elboof.</HI> Each <HI>Stroeg</HI> had one Piece of Canon and all nece&s;&s;ary Ammuni|tion, the whole number of the Men that were aboard this Fleet (as appeared by the Mu&s;ter-roll) did not exceed 2600 Men, whereof 2100 were of the <HI>Strelitzers</HI> of <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> who have &s;ome manner of Di&s;tinction among them&s;elvs.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day the <HI>Co&s;ac</HI> who had bin &s;o cruelly tortured was hanged up in &s;ight of the whole Army. In the mean time the Inhabitants of <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> began to mur|mur and breath Rebellion, inciting one another again&s;t the Governour and Magi|&s;tracy, which &s;eemed to be a very bad <HI>Omen</HI> of &s;ome ill Con&s;equence, for from that time forward they continued bolder and bolder till at length it bur&s;t out into palpable Rebellion. About this time arrived a <HI>Dutch</HI> Chirurgeon at <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> who had bin in the Retinue of the <HI>Mo&s;covian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> of whom I bought &s;om Silk &s;tuffs and 480 Hides of <HI>Turky</HI> leather, for which I immediately tendered the Money.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning (I think the 4th day) of <HI>June</HI> came a Gentleman from <HI>Chor|nojar</HI> with very unwelcom News. His Me&s;&s;age was that the &s;ame day that <HI>Knees Simeun Ivanowitz</HI> with the <HI>Ru&s;sian</HI> Army was arrived before that City, the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> appearing far more numerous and &s;trong, tho&s;e in the City revolted, declared them&s;elvs <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and &s;urrendred up the Town to <HI>Radzin</HI> and the Rebells. He added further, That all the loyal Officers who indeavored to di&s;&s;wade them there from, were mo&s;t inhumanly ma&s;&s;acred. This &s;ad Expre&s;s, altho &s;mothered as much as was po&s;&s;ible by the <HI>Waywod</HI> and Council of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> was neverthele&s;s come to the knowledge of the Townsmen, who were very impatient to bear the yoke of Obedience any longer. Upon this news I was &s;ent for by the <HI>Waywood,</HI> who a&s;ked me if my Men were able to manage the Cannon, and gave order that in the fir&s;t place all the Cannon &s;hould be vi&s;ited that lay upon the Walls, and to repair tho&s;e that were defectiv which was forthwith done.</P>

But I weighing well the Enterprize with my &s;elf, and con&s;idering the danger of adventuring with 22 Per&s;ons more, in a Shallop of 26 Foot long I thought it not good to e&s;&s;ay the matter.

<P>THE day following, being the 9^t^h of <HI>June,</HI> I received an order from the Governour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vi&s;it the Fortifications of the City.

<P>ON Friday the 20^t^h^. of <HI>June,</HI> the <HI>Waywod</HI> made me Lieutenant Coll. in place of <HI>James Wondram,</HI> which by provi&s;ion I took upon me, but being not well plea&s;|ed with my Charge, the Coll. who ob&s;erved it, &s;eem'd a little di&s;contented, and &s;aid in pre&s;ence of the Governour.

<P>ON Sunday, <HI>June</HI> 22 came the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> within &s;ight of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> and &s;ent <HI>Co&s;ac</HI> Trumpetter with a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Prie&s;t to demand the Town. The &s;aid <HI>Co&s;ac</HI> had al&s;o a Letter for me in <HI>Dutch,</HI> wherein I was advi&s;ed not to fight with my Men, if I hoped for Quarter, or Mercy at their hands. The &s;aid Letter was taken from me by the <HI>Waywod,</HI> before I had read it quite out, and torn in Pieces. The Trum|petter and Prie&s;t had Gaggs put in their Mouths, that they &s;hould cau&s;e no com|motion or alteration among the Commons; and were &s;oon after beheaded.</P>
<P>ON Munday came the <HI>Co&s;ac</HI>-Army with about 300 Keels, great and &s;mal clo&s;e to the City, puting in at a River near the Vineyards that ly about half a Leag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the Walls of the Town. Upon this we &s;et the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Tents on fire. Mean|while I &s;tood upon the top of the Governours hou&s;e, with the Governour him|&s;elf, and ca&s;ually e&s;pied &s;everal Boats in the River before the Town: I therefore advi&s;ed the Governour not to let them tarry there for alth&ocirc; they were but Fi&s;hers Boats yet they might give intelligence to the Enemy; wherefore he gave order imme|diatly to &s;ink them, which was forthwith put in execution. That afternoon the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Circas-Tartars</HI> had taken 4 <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who were put to the Rack and after con|fe&s;&s;ion, two were hanged up, and other two beheaded in pre&s;ence of the Governour.</P>
<P>THE day following the Collonel would have confirmed me in the Office I the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;upplied, to wit, as Lieutenant Colonel which I neverthele&s;s declined as before. This &s;ame day about noon the Great Dukes Factor pre&s;ented us with a Pipe of &s;trong
<PB N="369" REF="231">
Beer, and a Quantity of Tobacco, which we di&s;tributed among the Soldiers to give 'em Courage and keep them content. In the forepart of the night I went with the Chirurgeon to do the Rounds, which don I lay me down to &s;leep a little in my Tent but was quickly awaked with the Alarm, which gave notice how that the <HI>Co|&s;acks</HI> approached to begin their fir&s;t &s;torm, which happened about 3 a clock at the <HI>Wo&s;na&s;in&s;ke</HI> Gate, where our Ship-ma&s;ter and the <HI>Waywods</HI> Brother had the watch. The fir&s;t I e&s;pied was a &s;quare Body of the Enemy who approached very near, upon which I gave fire with our 12 Pounders, and was &s;econded by tho&s;e of the next Po&s;t, who &s;hot very fa&s;t. <HI>Interim</HI> came the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonel <HI>Baily</HI> to me in great ha&s;t with mo&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Officers, bringing news how that the City was already betray'd. The Colonel was him&s;elf wounded on the cheek with a Pike, as al&s;o in two or three places on his Leg, for being all in Armour they could not hurt him el&s;ewhere: and this he &s;aid was done by our own Soldiery. He told me further that he had done his utmo&s;t indeavour to pacify them and if it were po&s;&s;ible to ca&s;t an <HI>odium</HI> upon the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> as Rebells; but was fain to &s;mother all his rea&s;on &s;ore again&s;t his will and at la&s;t glad to come off with his Life. After a &s;mall conference together I advi&s;ed the Colonel to go again to his Po&s;t, and &s;ee if the per&s;wa&s;ion of other Officers had wrought any thing upon the <HI>Strelitzers:</HI> but the next news I heard was that the <HI>Strelitzers</HI> had ma&s;&s;acred all the Officers, which grieved me mo&s;t highly, becau&s;e that they had adventured their per&s;ons by my advice. Neither did this bloody Action hold up with that, for it came forward &s;o far that Captain <HI>Wederos</HI> who had the next Po&s;t to me was taken by his own &s;ervant, pinion'd fa&s;t and afterward in mo&s;t cruel manner murthered by his Soldiers. The Chirurgeon of whom I have already made mention &s;eeing this, would have thrown him&s;elf off the wall to avoid the danger of tho&s;e bloody Traitors; but I did all I could to with-hold him, and at la&s;t called to mind a certain Port-hole ju&s;t under the Tower which might &s;erve us for an <HI>Exitus</HI> out of all tho&s;e imminent dangers, in which we had certainly &s;uffered if we had not taken care betimes. Thr&ocirc; this we took our way and I charged the Chirurgeon with his Servant (being a <HI>Pole</HI>) to follow me, as al&s;o two of our Ships-Folk, to wit, <HI>James Trappen,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Brandt.</HI> Coming below we found there two <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> who &s;tood Sentinel, whom I charged to let us through. The&s;e not knowing any thing of the Tumult let us thr&ocirc; without much difficulty or Interrogations. The Chirurgeon went out before, and I follow|ed, but knew not what became then of the two Seamen and the <HI>Pole.</HI> We were forced to wade thr&ocirc; the Ditch to the neck, aiming at the Tartarian Field Quar|ters, which, as I have &s;aid, was burnd up that it might not be an advantage to the Enemy, which place we held for the mo&s;t &s;afe and &s;ecure. They &s;hot at us mainly from the Walls, but all to little purpo&s;e for we were got pretty far without Cannon reach, at le&s;t for &s;ingle Bodies: But marching a little forward we met two men, whom we &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> the Chirurgeon having a Firelock re&s;olved to di&s;charge as he al&s;o did, and &s;o far &s;urpri&s;ed he was that he grew de&s;perate and throwing him&s;elf into the River fell a &s;wimming. When I came up with them I under&s;tood that they were al&s;o fled for fear of being ma&s;&s;acred by the Commonalty; upon&punc; which I called out to the Chirurgeon that they were hone&s;t Men and under

the &s;ame Circum&s;tances we were our &s;elves, &amp;c. but could have no an&s;wer fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him. However not willing to leave him &s;o, I went to look out for him, and foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him among the Reeds half &s;pent, whence I drew him out, and perceiving him to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a way of Recovery marched forward along the River; and at la&s;t found a Fellow &s;leeping in a Boat, whom we awakened and compelled to bring us over to the other &s;ide: but finding no place of &s;helter or &s;ecurity we fell down the River, and about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 in the forenoon came to a Fi&s;hing place called <HI>Tro&s;ilzen Outzjouge,</HI> where we related all what had pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> to the Fi&s;hers. We would have gone further, but the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> would not go with us. However I prevailed &s;o far with the Chirurgeon that he was willing rather to go to Sea, than to tru&s;t him&s;elf to the mercy of the <HI>Co&s;acks.</HI> But he was very loth to tru&s;t him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;mall Boat, being well acquainted with the danger by untemperate Winds, incon&s;tant Sea&s;ons, and uncertain Tides. I had no more money by me than 7 <HI>Rubbels</HI> [about 3 lb. Sterl.] and bought a Mug-tent or Pavilion with a loaf of Bread weighing about 10 lb. and with that put off, tru&s;ting to the Providence of Almighty GOD, having the ad|vantage of the Tide. After two hours rowing we met 2 Fi&s;hers Boats, to whom we related how affairs &s;tood at <HI>A&s;trachan.</HI> The Fi&s;hers gave us very good words and comfortable Language, promi&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in what they might. We rowed as hard as we could, and bare them company to their Fi&s;hing place, called <HI>Ivanow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Outzjoug,</HI> where we met with a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Colonel, 2 Captains and 46 <HI>Strelitzen,</HI> The Colonels name was <HI>Maxim Lopatim,</HI> and lay in Garri&s;on at <HI>Terky</HI> intending for <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> but had not as then heard of the horrid Trea&s;on and Rebellion of the Commonaltie there, nor &s;o much as of the Attacque and Siege of the <HI>Co&s;acks.</HI> He under&s;tanding how affairs &s;tood there, re&s;olved to row back with us in the Boat to <HI>Terky,</HI> and advi&s;ing the two Captains to do the like who put their Goods aboard, and tacitly left the <HI>Strelitzers</HI> at <HI>Ivanowa Outzoug.</HI> Thus we rowed with all ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might, till we got the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, &s;till keeping near the Bank. After a little rowing we e&s;pied a Boat which rowed very hard after us: we al&s;o did all we could to outrow them, but they being more expert than we in general, gain'd room of us, and com|ing near our boat, one of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Captains jump'd over board, and was afterwards taken up by them. All the Arms we had was my Pi&s;tol, for the Chirur|geon had thrown his into the Water, when he &s;wam to &s;ave him&s;elf without <HI>A&s;tra|chan,</HI> as I have already, mentioned. In the Keel or Ve&s;&s;el that followed us were &s;everal Fi&s;hers, together with the <HI>Strelitzers,</HI> which were formerly under the Command of tho&s;e Officers that were with us ad left at <HI>Ivanowa Outzoug,</HI> who it &s;eems &s;o re&s;ented the matter that they had declared them&s;elves <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> thr&ocirc; di&s;gu&s;t that the Officers had not given them warning of the affairs of <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> who probably would have bin faithfull if they had bin &s;o kind as to acquaint them with the matter. In &s;hort they clo&s;ed up with us, took, plundered, bound and brought us back again to the Fi&s;hing place, where the Colonel alone had the Liberty to exerci&s;e his Devotion in the Church, but we were &s;ecured with a &s;trong Guard all the night long.</P>
<P>ON Thur&s;day the 25 of <HI>July</HI> they made preparation to bring us up to <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> and about noon we got &s;ight of the Town: and coming to a very convenient place
<PB N="371" REF="232">
to land at, they went a &s;hoar and divided the &s;poil, which they had taken from us. Being now alone I con&s;ulted with the Chirurgeon how that we might ea&s;ily make out e&s;cape being unbound and the Boat only made fa&s;t to a half-pike which I could very ea&s;ily manage. The Chirurgeon intimated the matter to the Colonel, de&s;iring that he would joyn indeavours with us to get free: but (whether out of fear, or in hopes of better u&s;age at the hands of the Rebells I cannot tell) he forthwith di&s;co|vers the de&s;ign, and gave the Rebells warning to have a care: upon which they &s;et a watch and guarded us &s;o &s;trictly that we could not make our e&s;cape. Seeing that our Enterpri&s;e proved abortiv and ineffectual, I told the Chirurgeon that I would run a little up the I&s;land and &s;wim over the Water to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> which I e&s;&s;ay'd to do, but was follow'd and taken; yet had that attempt not bin in vain if I had not chanc'd to fall which was no &s;mall di&s;advantage to me: however I betook me to the Water which I found there very &s;hallow, &s;o that they with a little wading fetch'd me out. But having got me, I cannot expre&s;s with what cruelty they u&s;ed me, beating me black and blew, which done, they bound me fa&s;t and threw me into the Boat, &s;o rowing up to the Town. By the way the Chirurgeon made a pro|po&s;al to them that if they would &s;ave us alive, they &s;hould have 100 <HI>Rubbels</HI> for my Ran&s;om and 70 for his own. They promi&s;ed to do their Indeavour for us. In the Evening we arrived at <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> where we were brought up before the General of the <HI>Co&s;acs.</HI> I had no Cloaths about me &s;ave only a pair of leathern Breeches, which were full of holes. The General &s;ate at the Gates of the Bi&s;hops Palace ero&s;s|legg'd after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> manner drinking Brandy, and was &s;o drunk that his Eies roll'd in his Read. He a&s;ked the Chirurgeon who he was? and what his Function was? which when he knew, gave him his Life, and ordered him to take care of the <HI>Co&s;acs</HI> that were wounded. Afterward he a&s;ked, who I was? the Chirurgeon made an&s;wer that I was his Companion: he further a&s;ked me what I could do; but the Chirurgeon leaving me, I could not return him any an&s;wer. The <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Co|lonel being examined, was immediately carried up to the top of a Tower called <HI>Roo&s;cat,</HI> and hurled headlong down. From the &s;ame Tower al&s;o was the Vice-roy, or <HI>Waywod,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Ivan Simeunowitz Pro&s;orofski,</HI> after many Tortures thrown al&s;o praecipitantly from Top to Bottom&punc; as al&s;o the Vice-Chancelor with all the Officers, of what degree &s;oever they were, either thrown down, or ca&s;t into the Water.</P>
<P>MOST dreadfull was this ma&s;&s;acre which continued for &s;ome time together; but GOD Almighty gave me an undaunted &s;pirit. The <HI>Co&s;ac</HI> General looking earne&s;tly upon me commanded his Men to give me Brandy, and made me drink off 2 cups one after another, and then gave order to bring me into the Camp: But what became of the 2 <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Captains I cannot tell. As I pa&s;&s;ed by to the Camp being put in a Boat that lay next to the Generals, I was e&s;pied of a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Strelitzer</HI> who brought news of my being &s;till alive to Madam <HI>Wonderham,</HI> the Lieutenant Colo|nels Widdow. I have already made mention how that among the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers that went out with the &s;aid Lieutenant Colonel, was one <HI>Paul Rudolph</HI> his Son in Law who was the only Per&s;on that remained alive: feigning him&s;elf in &s;uch extre|mity to be a <HI>Co&s;ac,</HI> for he was well acquainted with their &s;peech and manners. This

young Gentleman hearing that I was &s;till alive came to find me out in the Boat; and during this while were whole Boat loads of Men brought into the &s;tream, and throw into the Water, being tied together &s;o that they could not help them&s;elvs with &s;wim+ming. In this po&s;ture I lay my &s;elf till Friday <HI>June</HI> 27, expecting every moment my la&s;t Cata&s;troph. That day they brought me into a Tower, and tied me &s;o hard, that my blood for want of a natural reflux began to corrupt within my Body. My Arms were pinion'd, and my hands made fa&s;t behind my Back: my feet al&s;o were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o hard bound that I never expected to have the u&s;e of them again. Lying in this Po&s;ture and mo&s;t lamentable &s;tate I &s;pent my Time in &s;ighing and groaning. The Chirurgeon of whom we have already &s;poke came to vi&s;it me: I de&s;ired them to &s;ollicit for my Death, but they ever di&s;&s;waded me from it. Yet &s;till I in&s;i&s;ted very hard that they would make interce&s;&s;ion for me to the General that I might be di&s;pat|ched, giving them a private rea&s;on for that my earne&s;tne&s;s. Now. there was a Rule among the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> that if any came to interceed for a Captiv that he &s;hould dy him&s;elf for him, which the Chirurgeon told me al&s;o, yet promi&s;ed he would ad|venture him&s;elf to the General, and for that time took his leave.</P>
<P>THIS night I was mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed by the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> and <HI>Gogelats,</HI> a People of <HI>&V;krain</HI> &s;o called. And in the mean time was mo&s;t fearfully vexed with Toads and other vermin that continually ran over my Body and about my head in whole &s;warms. However I &s;pent my time in prayer as one condemned to dy and a&s;&s;ured of a &s;peedy Death, of which (I may truly declare) I was not in the le&s;t affraid, only feared that they would hang me up by the Heels, or put me to &s;ome &s;uch lingr|ing death, with which they continually threatned me.</P>
<P>ON Saturday the 28 of <HI>June</HI> came the afore&s;aid Chirurgeon, and told me that the General had &s;ent for me: and being untied I could hardly &s;tand upright, yet made a &s;hift to hupple after him. Being come in to the pre&s;ence of the General after a few idle impertinent Que&s;tions he a&s;ked me bad me go home with the Chirurgeon. From Sunday to Thur&s;day I continued there in hou&s;e with him, in which time I &s;aw much cruelty commited, &s;ome hanging up by the Feet, others with their Feet and hands chopt off left in the open &s;treet to &s;hift for them&s;elves, none daring &s;o much as put forth a finger to help them.</P>
<P>ON Thur&s;day <HI>July</HI> 3^d I was again taken and carried to the Brink of the River where I expected to part with my Life. But the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> told me, if I would pay the 100 <HI>Rubbles,</HI> which the Chirurgeon had promi&s;ed them on my behalf, I might go free: which the Chirurgeon, who again&s;t his will feigned him&s;elf to be a <HI>Co&s;ack,</HI> was content to di&s;bur&s;e for me, which afterwards I was obliged to repay upon de|mand, when able.</P>
<P>ON Sunday I was &s;ent for by the General, who was then a Drinking at the Em|perors Cellar, but nothing of moment pa&s;&s;ed at that time he being drunk, and forced me to drink off &s;everal Bowls of Brandy and Wine after one another, &s;o that I was affraid to di&s;plea&s;e him, being (as I have el&s;ewhere remembred) very outra|gious when drunk; wherefore I took occa&s;ion to &s;teal out of his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time happened many memorable pa&s;&s;ages, and cruel Examples of Tyranny, which would prove too tedious to relate. I &s;hould want words to expre&s;s

the mo&s;t barbarous and inhuman Acts and Torments, which the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> &s;tudied to kill and torture the Inhabitants and Loyal Officers, who did not forthwith &s;ubmit them&s;elvs to their unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t Wills.</P>
<P>On the Wedne&s;day following was the Secretary <HI>Alexo Alexowits</HI> hung up up|on a Fle&s;h-hook by the Ribbs, and &s;uffered much de&s;pightful u&s;age and Tor|ments before he died. The &s;ame was done to a Noble mans Son of <HI>Gilan.</HI> Al&s;o two Sons of the Vice-roy, Deputy, or <HI>Waywod</HI> were hung up by the heels, the one being a very hopefull youth of about 16 years of Age, and the other a Child of about 7 or 8 at the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Day following they were both found alive, and the younge&s;t at the in|terce&s;&s;ion and Mediator of &s;ome of <HI>Radzins</HI> Minions was taken down, and &s;av|ed alive, but the elde&s;t was thrown down from the Top of the Tower, whil&s;t &s;till alive, which was the Death his Father &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day I had News how that <HI>Chri&s;tian Brand</HI> one of my Men was &s;till alive, and was con&s;trained to feign him&s;elf as <HI>Co&s;ac.</HI></P>
<P>On the 20^t^h of July the <HI>Co&s;ac</HI> General <HI>Radzin</HI> departed with an infinite num|ber of &s;mall Shipping and &s;everall Thou&s;ands of Men, drawing 20 Men out of each Company to &s;erve for the Garri&s;on at <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> and left there 2 Governors of equal Command and Power, the one being a <HI>Co&s;ac,</HI> and the other a <HI>Ru&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 2 of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> began a New Ma&s;&s;acre continuing for &s;everal days to|gether, where takeing one day with another, were 150 Per&s;ons killed, &s;paring neither &s;ex nor Age. For which rea&s;on I began to hunt out for a Cave in the Earth where I might &s;ave my &s;elf in time of need, hearing of nothing but a perpetual and ince&s;&s;ant ma&s;&s;acre; and a general Lamentation of Parents for their Children, Wid|dows and Orphans for their Hu&s;bands and Fathers, and that as well among tho&s;e who had bin in&s;trumental and mo&s;t forward to let in the Rebells, as others that op|po&s;ed it; a ju&s;t reward for their Treachery who had been a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the Blood&s;hed of tho&s;e who under GOD &s;hould have protected them from &s;uch di&s;mal Calamities.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time I di&s;patched three Letter for <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and had notice how that <HI>Chri&s;tian Brandt</HI> was &s;et free. It &s;eems that he was taken for a <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> having a brown, &s;warthy complexion, and by &s;uch means was &s;pared in the ma&s;&s;acre; for all the <HI>Dutch</HI> were hewn down, or otherwi&s;e di&s;patched, &s;ave onely <HI>L. Fabritius</HI> Son in Law to Captain <HI>Rudolph.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time I had news by the Chirurgeon, how that my Ships-company that betook them&s;elvs to flight with the Shallop were run a&s;trand on the <HI>Scemkal</HI> or <HI>Dage&s;tan</HI> Coa&s;t, a Countrey butting out again&s;t the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>ON the 22 of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> was much Tyranny committed in the City, and people of all ages ma&s;&s;acred. The Chirurgeon after a long &s;oliciting procured a Pa&s;port to depart with a Servant to attend him, altho not without giving Security for his Return. This gave me likewi&s;e opportunity to leave the place under pretext of being his Servant.</P>
<P>ON Munday in the afternoon being <HI>Aug.</HI> 25 we left <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> and imbarqued our &s;elves aboard a Ve&s;&s;el belonging to &s;ome <HI>Banjan</HI> Merchants, who were al&s;o pil|laged and robbed of all they had.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="236">ON Tu&s;eday we came to Sea, &s;ailing clo&s;e by the Coa&s;t and to the Southward. We al&s;o &s;aw 3 &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, or Barks which indeavoured to keep Company with us. Having pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Settinabo Gora</HI> the Wind was flat North, and about the Evening all was calm.</P>
<P>THE Day following one of the above mentioned Shipping hail'd us, and &s;aid that they were bound for <HI>Terki</HI> and came from <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> being laden with Salt. We kept them Company along the Coa&s;t near the broken Land which is all grown over with huge tall Reeds: we had 11 and 12 Foot Water. At night one of tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els &s;tray'd about a Cannon &s;hot from us: and the next morning 2 Barks made up towards us and gave Fire, without doing any Execution: But when they came near us the cowardly <HI>Banians</HI> fell upon their knees and begged their Lives. In each Boat were 9 Per&s;ons and aboard of us were 46, &s;ome <HI>Per&s;ians, Tartars</HI> and <HI>Bouchars,</HI> but mo&s;t <HI>Banians.</HI> Coming to board us they plundered all to our very Provi&s;ion. I had about 8 <HI>Rubbles</HI> in Money and my Seal-ring which had bin once already re|deemed from the <HI>Co&s;acs.</HI> This Ring with the Money I gave to the Chirurgeon; but they threatning to put him to the Torture when it came to his turn to be pillaged; he confe&s;&s;ed all and delivered up the Money and Ring, be&s;ides 4 double Ducats of his own: but found an opportunity to hide 52 Ducats more after an e&s;pecial manner about his Body.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> had taken all and pillaged us of what they could find, they held a certain &s;ort of a Council among them&s;elves what they &s;hould do with us. At la&s;t it was re&s;olved after a long debate, that we &s;hould be &s;aved alive but turned off to Sea, with charge not to come anigh the Coa&s;t any more, upon pain of being thrown over board if they came to take us again.</P>
<P>UPON this they left us, and gave us opportunity to make u&s;e of the Wind, which was We&s;terly, and about the Evening with a bri&s;k Gale, and a dark moon we &s;et &s;ail and bore up to the Sea.</P>
<P>BUT after we had &s;ailed about 2 Leagues the Weather began to be &s;omwhat boi&s;trous, &s;o that we were fain to put in at a &s;mall Creek of an I&s;land, where we lay at Anchor till Saturday following; at what time the Weather growing more calm and temperate we weighed and bore up again to the Coa&s;t, where we imme|diatly de&s;cried 2 Barks that made up to us, and at la&s;t came clo&s;e by the board. The Chirurgeon and I had taken our la&s;t Farewel of each other, expecting nothing more than Death. In &s;hort, they fell a plundering us, and I to pa&s;s for a <HI>Banjan</HI> had anointed my &s;elf with Black tempered with Greace, and tied a Handhercheif about my Head, but it was &s;o botchingly don that they found occa&s;ion to a&s;k the Chi|rurgeon, what for a Black Devil that I was? In the mean while they &s;earched very clo&s;e for Bread and Provi&s;ion which I &s;eeing pointed to my mouth, whereupon they were &s;o merciful as to return me a part of the Provi&s;ion back again. Two <HI>De|ge&s;tan</HI> Merchants were thrown over board and the Chirurgeon who pa&s;&s;ed for a <HI>Pole</HI> was mo&s;t &s;everely beat. They threatned that if they met us again near the Coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that we &s;hould have no Mercy at their hands. Meanwhile I had lo&s;t my little Com|pa&s;s, &s;o that we had no other help in directing our Cour&s;e, than only the Sun and North-&s;tar. Towards the Evening it began to blow hard again and the Pyrats left
<PB N="375" REF="236">
us, bearing up clo&s;e to the Coa&s;t. The Surgeon had again hid his Gold in a place where they did not once make &s;earch for it.</P>
<P>THE Wind continued hard till Thur&s;day following, blowing mo&s;tly from North-W. and by N. and now changed again into W. N. W. which was good and favourable for us; but the <HI>Banians</HI> would in no wi&s;e give their con&s;ent that we &s;hould weigh Anchor, for that they thought it too high and boi&s;trous.</P>
<P>BUT on Saturday the Wind continuing &s;till in the &s;ame point, we weighed, and with a fre&s;h Gale &s;teered away South and by We&s;t; and &s;oon after de&s;cried a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el riding at Anchor, being one of tho&s;e that left <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> with us: tho&s;e aboard were <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and had the luck to e&s;cape the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> keeping off at Sea. When they &s;aw who we were, they weighed and kept us company. Towards the Evening the Wind blew North-Ea&s;t, and I found that we had &s;ailed too much We&s;terly, I pre&s;s'd hard that we &s;hould alter our cour&s;e, but could not prae|vail with them to &s;teer another way: &s;o that in the Morning we found our &s;elves clo&s;e to the Coa&s;t, and had the Wind at Ea&s;t and by N. With this &s;ort of Shipping it is very difficult to &s;teer without 12 points of the Compa&s;s Wind to their ad|vantage.</P>
<P>HOWEVER we thought good to keep clo&s;e to the Coa&s;t, but towards the Even|ing it growing calm we rowed off to the Seaward and lo&s;t the other Ve&s;&s;el. Meanwhile we began to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of Provi&s;ion, and fed of the crums of moldy Bread: and the greate&s;t part of the Company had no more to eat. But the <HI>Banjans</HI> were be&s;t provided, and imparted to us &s;uch as they had.</P>
<P><HI>INTERIM,</HI> the Wind came about Ea&s;t, and E. and by S. &s;o that we were con&s;trained to drop Anchor, and &s;o to ride three days at half a fathom Water. Yet growing calmer we ever now and then rowed a little. But having &s;pent all our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood were at a great lo&s;s for Fewel to bake bread, of that little quantity of Meal which the <HI>Banians</HI> had left: and were fain at la&s;t to cut up &s;ome parts of the Ship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Chips, which &s;tood us in very good &s;tead. The Wind then continued Ea&s;terly and we &s;teered as far Southerly as we could, till on the 10^t^h^. of <HI>September</HI> towards the Evening we came to a good place of Anchorage, near the Coa&s;t, of 5 Foot water, where I &s;tept a&s;hoar to &s;eek up &s;ome Wood and Herbs, or what el&s;e I thought might be &s;erviceable to us on our Voyage.</P>
<P>ON Thur&s;day being the 11^t^h^. of <HI>September</HI> we &s;ailed clo&s;e by the Coa&s;t which we kept in &s;ight till Saturday following, when as the <HI>Banians,</HI> a poor and helple&s;s People not able to endure &s;uch hard&s;hip, pre&s;&s;ed very hard that we &s;hould put a&s;hoar, which out of meer pity we were willing to do, being all wet and very cold.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE we were &s;et upon by a party of <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who now the third time plundered us: but the Chirurgeon not having time nor the conveniency to hide his Ducats as before, digged a hole and hid them in the Sand, and threw down his Mu&s;quet about the &s;ame place for a token to find them again. I al&s;o being afraid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an and hid my &s;elf among the Reeds; but they making a very narrow &s;crutiny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound me out: and having by me a P&s;almbook found that pa&s;&s;age or Title of a P&s;alm, where <HI>David</HI> is &s;aid to have feigned him&s;elf mad before the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> to e&s;cape them, I re&s;olved to do the like, by which means I e&s;caped. When they had me
<PB N="376" REF="237">
they di&s;puted what Countreyman I was, and &s;ome of them &s;aid I was a <HI>Dutchman</HI>: but others &s;aid I was a <HI>Georgian,</HI> and to my Happine&s;s the latter &s;way'd it. How|ever (not without wounding and killing of &s;ome of our Company they let us go, and them&s;elvs departed from us: which the Chirurgeon &s;eeing went and after much &s;eeking found his Gold.</P>
<P>ON the 20 of <HI>September</HI> it was very good Weather; we therefore made ready to &s;et &s;ail. About noon being under &s;ail we &s;aw about 30 <HI>Tartars</HI> on the Strand who called out to us that we &s;hould come a&s;hoar: This unwelcom &s;ummons mainly ad|ded to our fear; in&s;omuch that one of the <HI>Banians</HI> ran a&s;hoar and fell down upon his Knees. The Boat was drawn a&s;hoar, and after they had con&s;ulted a little together what they &s;hould do with us they demanded Ran&s;om, which was agreed upon for 3 <HI>Rubbles</HI> each Man. They were <HI>Circas</HI> and <HI>Nagayan Tartars,</HI> and accepted of one of the <HI>Banians</HI> for a Pledge till the Ran&s;om was paid. We went about two Miles with them and left our Ve&s;&s;el behind us. I had with me a little Coffer of Books which I carried along with me; and was fain to trudge a foot without either Shoes or Stoc|kings thr&ocirc; Thi&s;tles and Brambles, in&s;omuch that my Feet were all bli&s;tered and bloody. Towards the Evening we came in a Bay where their Shipping lay. Here I met with an <HI>Armenian</HI> whom I had formerly known at <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> who treated me very kindly, as al&s;o my Companion the Chirurgeon: but we having in &s;o long a time not eaten any thing which was fitting for human food, did Anatomize what was &s;et before us at &s;uch that the <HI>Armenian</HI> ob&s;erving it, thought good to take away before we had half &s;ati&s;fied ourappetite for fear we &s;hould &s;urfeit our &s;elves.</P>
<P>HERE we tarried three Days, waiting for a good Wind to go for <HI>Tarku,</HI> but that not falling out in this time are determined rather to go by land than to &s;tay there Wind-bound, it being not above a Days Journey, yet very perillous for the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> who continually lay in wait for di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and &s;tranded Pa&s;&s;engers, in the&s;e unhappy Proceedings of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who made the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea very un&s;afe to &s;ail.</P>
<P>ON Tu&s;eday being the 30 of <HI>September</HI> we &s;et forward, and after a very tedious Days Travel thr&ocirc; Boggs and Mar&s;hes we got to a Village inhabited by <HI>Nagaya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tartars:</HI> where we took up our nights re&s;t in the <HI>Circas</HI> Quarter. Here we met with a Friend of the Chirurgeons, whom we offered 8 Ducats to conduct us to <HI>Derbent,</HI> which he undertook to do. Here I &s;poke al&s;o with <HI>Ivan Turken</HI> Agent to his Im|perial Maje&s;ty, who was a <HI>Turk</HI> born, but a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Pro&s;elyte, and had a Brother at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;c&ouml;u</HI> who was of the Reformed Religion and an intimate Friend of mine. This &s;aid Gentleman intreated me to &s;tay longer at <HI>Terku,</HI> but I declined their kind offer yet was fain to accept of it for 2 Days having &s;o charged and overloaden my &s;tomach with eating that I fell &s;ick upon it.</P>
<P>ON the 6th. of <HI>October</HI> we &s;et forward for <HI>Derbent</HI> in company with the <HI>Banians.</HI> Now by the way you are to note that every day we &s;uffered &s;uch hunger, a Mans ran&s;om was thrown into the water, which the &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Banians</HI> hold for a &s;pecial act of Piety and a Religious Injunction. By the way we met &s;om Thou&s;and of <HI>Tartars,</HI> for whom we were not a little affraid, they being <HI>Nagayans</HI> and noted Plagiaries.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="237">AFTER three days travel we came to a Village called <HI>Andre Dereefad</HI> which was &s;ubject to one <HI>Chapelle,</HI> a <HI>Tartarian</HI> Prince. We &s;taid here till Munday following being the &s;eventh of <HI>October.</HI> Here I happened to &s;py a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> who had my Plu&s;h-Coat on, which he &s;aid he had bought at <HI>Terku.</HI> The Fur or Lining co&s;t me thirty five <HI>Rubbles</HI> at <HI>Mu&s;cou</HI>; and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> was willing to &s;ell it me again for five or &s;ix <HI>Rubbles,</HI> but I could not accompli&s;h &s;o much Money as to purcha&s;e it. Here we al&s;o came to under&s;tand that my Ships|folk who fled in a Challop were &s;tranded and taken &s;laves.</P>
<P>ON Thursday the tenth <HI>ditto,</HI> we came into <HI>Terku,</HI> where we had two <HI>Armenians</HI> for our Friends; the&s;e al&s;o brought me to one of their Acquaintance for Protection, where I was advi&s;ed to keep my &s;elf very private, being a free Prize for the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Here we al&s;o found <HI>Lewis Faber</HI> of whom I have alrea|dy made mention, as al&s;o <HI>Chri&s;tian Brand</HI> one of my Ships-folk; who left <HI>A&s;tra|chan</HI> three Weeks after us, and had been eight Days at <HI>Terku.</HI></P>
<P>ON the thirteenth we left <HI>Terku,</HI> and hired a per&s;on for eight Ducats to conduct us to <HI>Derbent.</HI></P>
<P>ON the &s;eventeenth we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Boynak,</HI> where I under&s;tood &s;om of our Men were in &s;lavery, I &s;ent our Conduct up to the Town (not daring appear there my felf) with Letters to advi&s;e them to per&s;i&s;t in the Chri&s;tian Faith, if they were pre&s;s'd upon to embrace Mahometani&s;m with promi&s;e of doing my be&s;t to procure their Redemption. But my Squire the Courier, thought good to give us the Bag, having already got his Money in hand, nor did I ever hear a word from them, alth&ocirc; I gave them directions how to write to me at <HI>Derbent.</HI> Howe|ver when I arrived there I found <HI>Cornelius de &V;ries,</HI> who had been my Gunner; and one <HI>Peter Arent&s;z</HI> of <HI>Sceveling,</HI> who gave me a perfect account of the Ships-Company, how they were taken Slaves, and whither they were car|ried, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;olicited by the <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Derbent</HI> for the Redemption of our Men, who was plea&s;ed to di&s;patch Letters on that behalf to the Prince of the <HI>Calmuc-Tartars</HI>; but having &s;ent two Po&s;ts, and all to no purpo&s;e or effect, I went to tender my thanks to the <HI>Sultan</HI> for his Civility and Indeavours; to which he reply'd,
<Q>That he was &s;orry he could not prevail with the <HI>Tartars</HI> to an&s;wer my. De&s;ire, yet was willing to do us any kindne&s;s that lay in his power, if we could imagine any mean whereby they might procure their Liberty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
I in&s;i&s;ted further to have &s;om Hor&s;es for our u&s;e on the Journey which he grant|ed; but there was none to be had in all the Town, the <HI>Caravan</HI> being but newly &s;et forward for <HI>Scamachy.</HI> Yet finding another ready to depart, the Seamen went afoot in company of the <HI>Caravan.</HI> I &s;upplied them al&s;o with ne|ce&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, and told them that I would &s;tay a day, or two longer, to &s;ee if I could get &s;om Hor&s;es and then follow them. But it was in vain, for I could not get any, wherefore I followed the <HI>Caravan</HI> and coming at <HI>Scabran.</HI> which is reckoned the half way, we were informed that there were &s;everal Hackneys in the Town, which we hired.</P>
<P>ON the twenty ninth we arrived at <HI>Scamachi:</HI> where we found <HI>John Struys</HI>
<PB N="378" REF="238">
our Sail-Maker, who was bought by a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance I de&s;ired in an Addre&s;s to the <HI>Chan</HI>; 'tis true he &s;eemed willing to do us &s;uch a favour if it could have been done without much Trouble. Here I delivered a Reque&s;t to the <HI>Chan,</HI> and had <HI>Audience,</HI> wherein I made a plain demon&s;tration of the Injury our Men &s;uffered by the <HI>Calmucs, &amp;c.</HI> He promi&s;ed me to do his be&s;t for them, but all was to no purpo&s;e, &s;o that I was fain to take up &s;eventy five <HI>Abbas</HI> upon &s;ecurity of a <HI>Banian</HI> Merchant, which was to be paid at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> within &s;even Weeks time and twenty five <HI>Abbas</HI> U&s;e, or Intere&s;t; but in ca&s;e of failure of payment in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to be paid at <HI>Scamachy</HI> within three Months with fifty <HI>Abbas</HI> Intere&s;t; the Chirurgeon being my &s;ecurity. Here I al&s;o reck'ned with the Chirurgeon, and gave him an Obligation under my hand for what I had received of him, as al&s;o for what he remained &s;ecurity for me at <HI>Scamachy.</HI></P>
<P>ON the fifteenth I left <HI>Scamachy</HI> having with me <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Gunner. <HI>P. Arent&s;z</HI> &s;taid with the Chirurgeon, and <HI>J. Struys, L. Fabritius</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Brand</HI> with the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Envoy.</P>
<P>I had very much difficulty by the way to come to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> yet by the Provi|dence of Almighty God arrived here the tenth of <HI>March,</HI> and have Re&s;idence for the time, in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Lodge: where I find Sr. <HI>Frederic Bent</HI> Pre&s;ident for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, to whom, as well as the Gentlemen his A&s;&s;i|&s;tants, I am infinitely obliged to for many Civilities &s;hown me. <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Gunner they have &s;ent away for <HI>Gameron.</HI> I al&s;o cau&s;ed <HI>J. Struys</HI> and the &s;aid Gunner, with another Fore-Ma&s;t Man to &s;ign a Declaration how they fled away from <HI>A&s;trachan</HI> and left me and the Ma&s;ter a&s;hoar.</P>
<P>SIR, I have not el&s;e to write, but fearing by this prolixity to have tired your Patience, I cea&s;e to be more tedious, and commit you to the Protection of the Mo&s;t High GOD, who that he would in Mercy vouch&s;afe us a happy meeting is the only and hearty Prayer, of</P>
