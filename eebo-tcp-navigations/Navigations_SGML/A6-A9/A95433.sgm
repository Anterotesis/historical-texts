<P>ACcording to the la&s;t Orders of the States of Holland, Vantrump put forth to Sea (with the Fleet which before he lay with all between the Earle of WAR|VVICK, and the revolted Ships) the 9. of this in&s;tant November, this gave us &s;ome far|ther a&s;&s;urance, be&s;ides the promi&s;es they for|merly made to us, that no interruption would be given us, but that we might with|out di&s;turbance u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours in accompli&s;hing the Parliaments and Kingdomes &s;ervice, which we are about, and for effecting thereof, no &s;ooner was Vantrump put out to Sea, but the Lord Ad|mirall waighed Anchor, and &s;ailed quite up into the Creeke almo&s;t as high as Delfe
<PB N="2" REF="3">Sluce, which is neere unto Gorey, and mo&s;t of the revolted Ships were within view neer to the other &s;hoare, &s;ome great Guns were di&s;charged on both &s;ides, but little ex|ecution done, then the Lord Admirall per|ceiving that night began to approach, and like to be mi&s;ty and dark, he gave Order to each Squadron to look diligently to their Guard, and the next morning, the CON|STANT WAR VVICK de&s;ired a Parlee, which being granted, the Officers and tho&s;e Sailors which were left in her, &s;ubmitted and came in, de&s;ired to be indempnified for what was pa&s;t; after her &s;ubmitted the Hind, the Love, and the Satisfaction, the re&s;t of tho&s;e Ships &s;ought &s;anctuary in the Harbour of Helver Sluce, and Prince Rupert u&s;eth his be&s;t skill to &s;atisfie tho&s;e that re|main with him, and cau&s;ed &s;everall peeces of Ordinance to be drawne forth and plan|ted on the &s;hore: but whether that will be allowed on by the Dutch, we cannot yet know of any certainty; but &s;ome of them a&s;|&s;ure us the contrary: it is rumoured, that the Prince is daily expected with them, yet, they
<PB N="3" REF="3">&s;ay, he is not &s;o well recovered, as to come from the Hague, his Highne&s;&s;e (we hear) is with the Lord Admirall, and thereby &s;eek to make an agreement with the Parlia|ment, and return again into England: but if any &s;uch thing be moved, let all men be a&s;&s;ured that nothing will be acted that way, but what &s;hall be with advice and approba|tion of Parliament. The Duke of York is with Prince Rupert; if the Treaty doth not take effect, &s;o as a peace be contented for all parties, it is thought the Prince will back a|gaine into France.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Believe you have heard, (before this ki&s;&s;es your hands) that &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;hips which did adhere to the Prince, and de&s;erted the Parliament, are gone in to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> but &s;ince tho&s;e four which fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to him went away, two or three more have followed; among&s;t which is the <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> which bare the Prince his Colours, and the re&s;t are blocked up in Helver-Sluce, &s;o that it is believed that not one of them can e&s;cape, if they &s;hould doe their uttermo&s;t to obtaine it; but
<PB N="4" REF="4">to tell you the truth, of what we thinke, it is rather conceived, that they will follow the example of tho&s;e which are already gone to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> then di&s;pute the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e any further; for the making Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Commander in chief of the Prince his Fleet in his ab&s;ence, bred &s;uch a rankor in the hearts both of Seamen and others, that when he came and read his Commi&s;&s;ion to them, they &s;tucke not to tell him, that they had rather &s;heath their &s;words in his bowels then be commanded by him, &amp; indeed when <HI>Batten</HI> &amp; <HI>Jorden</HI> (by rea&s;on of di&s;content) left his High|ne&s;s, the greate&s;t part of the Navy, there went off with them, or &s;taggred in their affections, &s;o that in all pro|bability the Prince had not &s;ooner gained this Fleet, and &s;et up his Standard then it will be lo&s;t: For the Earle of <HI>Warwick</HI> doth not only keep in the remain|ing part, &s;o that they mu&s;t in all likelyhood within a &s;hort time &s;ubmit, but with the manning of tho&s;e which are already come into him (whereof &s;ome car|ry 40. peeces of Ordinance a peece) hath &s;ent a gal|lant Squadron of Ships to the Downes, to be a guard to Marchants and other Ships pa&s;&s;ing upon the nar|row Seas.</P>
<P>The Prince is not &s;o well recovered as to come from the Hague, and the Earle of <HI>Warwick</HI> hath &s;ent another &s;ummons to the Ships which &s;helter them|&s;elves in Helver-Sluce, &s;o that it is believed the hopes which &s;ome did entertain that there would by way of Treaty be an agreement between his Highne&s;&s;e and the Earle of <HI>Warwick,</HI> wil. come to nothing</P>
