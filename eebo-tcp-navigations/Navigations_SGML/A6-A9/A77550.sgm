<L>HElls ble&s;sings on thee, my bla&s;phemous &s;on,</L>
<L>Thou ha&s;t thy brother <HI>Rab&s;hekah</HI> out-done.</L>
<L><HI>Shimei</HI> was Courtly, (if compar'd to thee)</L>
<L>Thou every week writ'&s;t higher Bla&s;phemie.</L>
<L><HI>Korah</HI>'s gain-&s;aying, if compar'd to thine,</L>
<L>Was Petit-trea&s;on: Thou in every line</L>
<L>Out-vy'&s;t all the&s;e. Thou bravely play'&s;t thy part,</L>

<L>All I can promi&s;e, is, when thou &s;halt come,</L>
<L>Thou &s;halt be glorious for thy martyrdome.</L>
<L>Nay thou &s;halt &s;et thy hou&s;e in order too,</L>
<L>And in thy death <HI>Achitophel</HI> out-doe.</L>
<L>Thou taught'&s;t the people better to rebell,</L>

<L>(As <HI>Iulian</HI> did) and ca&s;t thy blood on hie.</L>
<L>Or thou &s;halt die like <HI>Arrius,</HI> who with&s;tood</L>
<L>The Nazarite, voiding both thy guts and blood.</L>
<L>Yet we will write for thee an Epitaph,</L>

<L>Hic jacet Britannicus, Scurra, Rabula, Lixa, Lani&s;ta,</L>

<L>We vvill prepare &s;uch Mu&s;ique for thine eare</L>

<L>He took delight to heare the parting grones</L>
<L>Of tortur'd vvretches, and vvould prai&s;e their tones.</L>
<L>And now the meane&s;t &s;oule impri&s;oned here,</L>

<L>And for a Gu&s;to doth exceed mans wi&s;h.</L>
<L>Flapdragon we will drink in&s;tead of Wine,</L>

<L>This liquor is by cunning Chymi&s;ts drawn</L>
<L>From &s;everall Mineralls to dige&s;t the Brawn.</L>
<L>This with our very breaths to flames will turn,</L>

<L>Two dozen of pious preaching Si&s;ters tongues,</L>
<L>As many Woodcocks heads, two Foxes lungs.</L>
<L>Who eats this Ollio, he &s;hall quickly find</L>
<L>A &s;trange encrea&s;e of braine, and length of wind.</L>
<L>Twelve Independents Gammons &s;hall be &s;et</L>
<L>Upon the board, well &s;moak'd, and black as jet.</L>
<L>(For the We&s;tphalians learnt this art of me,</L>
