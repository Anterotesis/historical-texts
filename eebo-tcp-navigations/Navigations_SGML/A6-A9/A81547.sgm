<HEAD>The Tran&s;lators PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of that little <HI>French</HI> Novel (whereof this is a Tran&s;lation) in his Preface to the Reader, does a&s;&s;ure him, that there is not any one Character in the whole Piece, which was drawn by the Life; and that he de|&s;ign'd it no otherwi&s;e then as a general Repre&s;entation of tho&s;e
<PB REF="3">many and great Extravagancies&punc; which <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> had occa&s;ion'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <HI>France,</HI> and which were the Grounds of a late Edict; whereby not only that, but &s;ome other Games of the like Na|ture, were publickly forbid.</P>
<P>Now if he cou'd &s;;ay &s;o, how much more may the Tran&s;lator; who, being an ab&s;olute Stranger to this Game, as well as all o|thers, cannot rea&s;onably be thought to have de&s;ign'd this as a Reflection upon any Per&s;on whatever, e&s;pecially &s;ince he did not think fit to lay the Scene in <HI>England.</HI> The Pa&s;time of a few idle Hours, and the de|&s;ire of pre&s;erving that very lit|tle
<PB REF="3">&s;mattering in the <HI>French</HI> Language which he can pretend to, was all the Inducement or De|&s;ign he had in undertaking this pre&s;ent Tran&s;lation; wherein (tho' he never intended it as a literal one,) there are but very few places, and tho&s;e too little material, that vary from the Ori|ginal.</P>

<HEAD>THE DISORDERS OF BASSETT.</HEAD>
<P>ONE Day at Madam <HI>Gendrill's</HI> at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> he that kept the Bank taillied with the great|e&s;t Fortune in the World; he never lo&s;t &s;o much as one <HI>Sept|et-le-va,</HI> and &s;eldom the <HI>Paroli,</HI> in&s;omuch that he broke all the Setters; &s;ome were complaining and &s;ighing, others crying, fretting, and &s;wearing; every
<PB N="2" REF="5">one, in fine, had &s;ome particular way or other to expre&s;s the great Concern he was in; a|mong&s;t whom Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> bore no &s;mall part, &s;he having been a con&s;iderable lo&s;er; and that which vex'd her mo&s;t, was to lo&s;e the &s;ame Card four times in one Deal. The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Roziers,</HI> who was in Love with her, being extreamly afflicted to &s;ee her &s;o concern'd, Madam, &s;aid he, &s;et the re&s;t of your Mo|ney upon the Knave, I believe 'twill prove a good Card, ha|ving lo&s;t twice already. You have never yet been lucky to me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, yet I'll ven|ture for once; the <HI>Knave</HI> won a <HI>Sonica.</HI> Pray Madam, &s;aid the Marqui&s;s, make the Paroli upon the &s;ame Card. Once more, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I mu&s;t needs tell you, you were
<PB N="3" REF="5">not born to bring me good Luck, yet however I'll venture; the Knave won again. Now, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, upon what Card &s;hall we make the <HI>Sep-et-le-va?</HI> Ma|dam, replyed the Marqui&s;s, ve|ry coldly, I was never born to bring you good Luck, therefore be pleas'd to chu&s;e one your &s;elf. Pray, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, think of a Card quickly. Madam, &s;aid the Marqui&s;s, very heavily, you will certainly lo&s;e it; &s;he made the <HI>Sept-et-le-va</HI> upon the Ace, the Ace lo&s;t; whereupon &s;he ro&s;e up on a &s;udden, tore the Ace, and all her Book; and throwing the Pieces at the Mar|qui&s;s, I &s;hou'd think it &s;trange, &s;aid &s;he to him, in an angry and di&s;dainful way, if in all my Life, I &s;hou'd thrive in any one thing, wherein I have to do with you; believe me, we two were
<PB N="4" REF="6">not born but to be a Plague to each other. The Marqui&s;s tryed to pacifie her, and proffer'd he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Hand to wait on her home; but &s;he refu&s;ed it very Scorn|fully, without &s;o much as ta|king the lea&s;t notice of him. This Carriage of hers troubled him extreamly, and threw him into a deep Melancholy, which his Friend the Count <HI>de Charlois</HI> having perceiv'd, ro&s;e from <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ett,</HI> and went away with him in his Coach.</P>
<P>When &s;oon after, as the Mar|que&s;s was lolling very thought|fully, the Count turning that way, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon him, &s;aid to him, Unhappy Wretch that thou art, to have a concern for one who does &s;o little de|&s;erve it; a &s;illy Coquette creature, whom none but your &s;elf wou'd ever have thought of. What do
<PB N="5" REF="6">you find in her, continu'd he, that is taking? She is lean, &s;he has a wide Mouth. What, &s;aid the Marqui&s;s, intetrupting him, do I &s;ee in her that is taking? Who ever &s;aw more lovely and charming blew Eyes then hers are? Was there ever a clearer and a more delicate Complexion, a whiter and more even &s;ett of Teeth, a better proportion'd No&s;e, or a more exact and ea&s;ie &s;hape then &s;he has? Call you tho&s;e lovely and charming Eyes, re|ply'd the Count, which are &s;o &s;unk into her Head; or that Com|plexion delicate and clear, which &s;ometimes is &s;o hideous yellow? Her No&s;e is inclin'd to red, or looks blewi&s;h at the be&s;t: If her Teeth are white and even, 'tis that &s;he u&s;es Opiate Powders, and the File &s;o often. Is that to bs exact|ly and ea&s;ily &s;hap'd, to have &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="7">an aukard gate as &s;he has? Her Neck, I mu&s;t confe&s;s is white; but yet, were it not for the Tay|lor, 'tis &s;uch a one as no body wou'd &s;ee it. She's a Wit 'tis true, but a very dangerous, and ill|natur'd one. If any Woman is Hand&s;ome, Airy, or any ways accompli&s;h'd, &s;he can't indure her, but in all Companies where e're &s;he comes, is rai&s;ing a thou&s;and &s;piteful Stories of her. She hates all Woman-kind; but then, to make amends, &s;he's is in love with all Mankind: And I believe you are the only Man &s;he ever u&s;ed ill; and that for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e you have too much worth in you; a thing no ways agreeable to her humour. For my part I declare, if heretofore I have had any inclination for her, it has been a very &s;light one, and &s;uch as never went near to my
<PB N="7" REF="7">Heart. Count &s;aid the Marqui&s;s, I'me told you two are not very well together. Troth reply'd the Count, very briskly, becau&s;e I'me grown weary of her. She's a &s;trange humour'd Woman, and 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e her. When I us'd to vi&s;it her I look'd as thin and lean as a Skele|ton. What I now tell you, is not out of any &s;pleen to her, but a real concern I have to &s;ee you &s;o de&s;perately ingaged, and a de&s;ire to cure you of &s;o unrea&s;onable and &s;o unfortunate a Pa&s;&s;ion. A|las! dear Count, reply'd the Marqui&s;s; little do you know my heart in this matter; I am not my own Ma&s;ter as you think; my rea&s;on is quite given up, and whatever Difficulties and Argu|ments &s;he oppo&s;es to my Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;erve but to make her more ab&s;o|lutely imperious. Nay, what
<PB N="8" REF="8">way is there in the World, that I have not tryed to cure my &s;elf of the Pa&s;&s;ion I have for Madam <HI>Landroze;</HI> and yet all, alas! has &s;erv'd only to make me more de&s;|perately in love with her. How often have I, quite di&s;heartn'd by her &s;lights, with Tears in my Eyes, &s;aid to her, Farewel Ma|dam, and for ever farewel? Once I took up a re&s;olution ne|ver to &s;ee her more: but &s;carce cou'd I in pain, linger out two whole days in that mind, but I was forc'd to take up a new one. I am not, I wou'd then &s;ay, &s;uf|ficiently reveng'd of her in not &s;eeing her any more; 'twere fit &s;he &s;hou'd &s;ee her &s;elf &s;lighted, and me prefer another before her.</P>
<P>I went to Ma&s;s to the <HI>Petits Ca|pucins,</HI> where I knew &s;he us'd to go every day. I will &s;alute her, thought I, but it &s;hall be with
<PB N="9" REF="8">that coldne&s;s, and indifferency, that &s;he &s;hall &s;oon perceive how little I value her; and if I &s;how any Concern or Complai&s;ance for any body, it &s;hall be for Ma|dam <HI>Rocheron</HI> her mortal Enemy. ah! thought I, &s;o &s;hall I be fuf|ficiently reveng'd. But oh! the moment I &s;py'd her out in the Church, I forgot all my former Re&s;olutions; and in&s;tead of a cold and a di&s;dainful Behaviour, I &s;aluted her with all the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive and langui&s;hing Looks ima|ginable.</P>
<P>As I was di&s;cour&s;ing with Ma|dam <HI>Rocheron,</HI> I ob&s;erv'd a Sha|green in Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Looks: immediately, forgetting the De|&s;ign that brought me thither, I flew away in a great hurry, and confu&s;ion, without being able to beg her Pardon. When I came home, reflecting upon my weak|ne&s;s;
<PB N="10" REF="9">fly, fly, &s;aid I, every place where Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> is: there is nothing but ab&s;ence can cure me. The Court was at <HI>Fontain|bleau.</HI> I left <HI>Paris,</HI> and went thither, where I &s;ought out for a hundred Pa&s;times, and Diver|&s;ions, to make me forget her; Walking, Gaming, Treating and Gallanting the Ladies, was the con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. Yet wou'd you wonder to &s;ee how this cruel Pa&s;&s;ion did &s;lily &s;huffle it &s;elf into the mid&s;t of all my Diver&s;ions. I had not gone an hundred Yards into the Wood at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> when falling into a deep Melancholy, my Head ran of nothing but Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> and I wi&s;h'd to meet her there, that I might reproach her with In|gratit ude. When ever I enter|tain'd any of the Ladies with a|ny piece of Gallantry, I in&s;en&s;i|bly
<PB N="11" REF="9">addre&s;s'd my &s;elf to her, who had mo&s;t of the Air of Madam <HI>Landroze.</HI> At <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> at the Queen's, or any where el&s;e, when I have lo&s;t a <HI>Paroli</HI> or <HI>Sept-et-le-va;</HI> alas! &s;aid I to my &s;elf, Can &s;o unfortunate a Crea|ture as I am, ever hope to have good luck; when ever I have won, the&s;e are not the Joys, thought I, that can make me happy. In the mid&s;t of great Dainties, the delicate Flavour of the riche&s;t Wines imaginable, is no otherwi&s;e plea&s;ant to me, then as it &s;erves to amuze me with the vain Thoughts of what a concern &s;he will be in to have lo&s;t me, and of being capable by that means to make her &s;en&s;i|ble of the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>All the while the Court was at <HI>Fontainbleau;</HI> I &s;pent my time &s;o mi&s;erably as I tell you; and by
<PB N="12" REF="10">this way of living. I was grown &s;o moap'd, and &s;o fall'n away, that no body cou'd have known me. Being &s;en&s;ible at la&s;t, that none of the&s;e Remedies were &s;ufficient to cure me; I re&s;olv'd to return to <HI>Paris,</HI> and throwing my &s;elf at her Feet, to ask her Pardon. But after I had given her a faith|ful Account how di&s;mally I &s;pent my time at <HI>Fontainbleau;</HI> wou'd you believe what an An&s;wer this Ungrateful Creature made me? Mon&s;ieur Marqui&s;s &s;aid &s;he, you have made good u&s;e of the time you &s;pent in reading Romances, and have an admirable way of repre&s;enting the Characters of tho&s;e great Heroes. Oh cruel Creature! was ever the like &s;aid? Faith Marqui&s;s, &s;aid the Count ve|ry briskly, &s;hall I tell you my mind plainly; you are a meer Novice in this Affair. Alas, what good
<PB N="13" REF="10">can you hope to make of &s;uch Florid Di&s;cour&s;es: the Ladies of this Age, (e&s;pecially &s;uch as Madam <HI>Landroze</HI>) are for &s;ome|thing more &s;ub&s;tantial, and to the purpo&s;e. Are you in Love with a Woman, and wou'd you that &s;he &s;hou'd return it? find out what &s;he takes mo&s;t delight in, and make your Court to her that way. Is &s;he Mu&s;ically gi|ven? entertain her with publick Mu&s;ick-meetings, and treat her often at the <HI>Opera.</HI> If &s;he loves Play, go halfs with her, and be &s;ure never to let her want Mo|ney. Do's &s;he love fine Cloaths, and to be always well dre&s;s'd? Pre&s;ent her with the Riche&s;t, and mo&s;t fa&s;hionable Silks you can meet with. If &s;he loves to eat well, make her frequent enter|tainments; and, as often as
<PB N="14" REF="11">may be; let 'em be given out of Town; and then if at any time, you find her in better hu|mour, and more tran&s;ported then ordinary, make u&s;e of the opportunity; bear up to her briskly, and be not frighted with the &s;hew of a forc'd Mode|&s;ty: if &s;he's angry beg her Par|don, and lay the blame upon the violence of your Pa&s;&s;ion: Wo|men are always ea&s;ie to forgive Affronts of that nature: As &s;oon as ever you are reconcil'd, be not afraid, but at her again, and try your Fortune three or four times more; till at la&s;t, take my word for't, you'l find that Happy and Critical Minute you look for. Count reply'd the Marqui&s;s, you talk like an Errant Debauche&egrave;: Know you not, that I naturally hate Debauchery, and de&s;ire no|thing further of Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="11">then to make my &s;elf Ma&s;ter of her Heart? Alas! Poor Young Man, &s;aid the Count, a Woman's Sen&s;es and Affections always go together; So that whoever plea|&s;es the former, may be &s;ure not to mi&s;s of the latter. Well, well, Count, reply'd the Mar|qui&s;s, you, that pretend to be &s;o bold, how wou'd you, were you in my place, behave your &s;elf before Madam <HI>Landroze?</HI> How? &s;aid the Count, very ea&s;ily: She loves Play, and particularly <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett;</HI> keep a Bank at her Hou&s;e, do you-tailliee, and let her be your Crouppier. I am acquainted with the Chevalier <HI>Briere,</HI> he is a cunning profe&s;s'd Game&s;ter, knows all the Game&s;ters about <HI>Paris,</HI> and wou'd be glad with all his Heart to go in the Bank: He wall bring you as many Game|&s;ters as you de&s;ire. Madam
<PB N="16" REF="12"><HI>Landroze</HI> is Covetous, and the advantage the Bank has over the Setters, is &s;o great, that at the long run, you will infallibly be a con&s;iderable winner. This is the way you mu&s;t take to win her Heart. By this means you will have an opportunity of &s;ee|ing her ev'ry day, and of rally|ing with her upon all tho&s;e who lo&s;e their Money. As for the Chevalier, 'tis no matter whe|ther he knows the Intrigue or no; for he has an admirable way of making Di&s;coveries. In fine, you will be allow'd a great freedom, and have a thou&s;and little &s;ecrets told you; and with|out je&s;ting, the Money &s;he will win in going with you, will make you appear more amiable in her &s;ight, and &s;he con&s;equent|ly more &s;en&s;ible of the Pa&s;&s;ion you have for her. Ah! Count,
<PB N="17" REF="12">reply'd the Marqui&s;s, what a Propo&s;al have you made me, I have &s;o great a Pa&s;&s;ion for Ma|dam <HI>Landroze,</HI> that I cannot en|dure the very thoughts of it; to keep a Bank at her hou&s;e, and make it a publick Gameing Ordinary, and Rendevouze for all &s;orts of People, where every Rake-helly Sharper of the Town, and common Strumpet, is Hail-fellow-well-met with Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Reputation and Quali|ty, to expo&s;e her every Minute to a thou&s;and Foolleries, and impertinent Di&s;putes and Quar|rels: Fie! fie! 'tis a thing I can't endure to think of. Troth, re|ply'd the Count, 'tis plea&s;ant to &s;ee how wonderful nice, and ten|der you are of Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Reputation; when, at this very in&s;tant, People of the be&s;t Qua|ilty in all <HI>Paris,</HI> make no &s;cruple
<PB N="18" REF="13">of having <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> at their Hou&s;es; and I know &s;ome of very good Fa&s;hion, that neither care for <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> or any other &s;ort of Gameing, and yet are de&s;irous to have it at their Hou&s;es for the Profit of the Card-money; and if you'll do &s;o for her, take my Word for't &s;he'll never &s;cruple it. Will you hold an hundred Pounds, continued the Count, that &s;he does not agree to't, when you have once convinc'd her that there's Money to be got by't? All Women are Covetous, and &s;he the mo&s;t in the World. In fine, the Count made it &s;o plain and clear to the Marqui&s;s before he left him, that he went away with a Re&s;olution of &s;etting up a Bank at Madam <HI>Lan|droze's</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Rozier</HI>'s went to her
<PB N="19" REF="13"><HI>Leve&egrave;,</HI> where having diverted the peevi&s;h humour &s;he was in (as being but ju&s;t up) he began to demon&s;trate to her how di&s;|advantageous a Game <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> was to the Setters, and how certain|ly advantageous to them that keep the Bank, when there were a great many that play'd. That at <HI>Venice,</HI> where <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> was fir&s;t found out, the <HI>Venetians</HI> Farmed the &s;ole Power and Right of keeping the Bank, at Fifty or Sixty thou&s;and Crowns a year, which cou'd never turn to Ac|count, were not the advantages which the Bank has infinitely great, as was ea&s;ie to be com|prehended; for Example, &s;aid he, there are Thirteen different Cards; &s;uppo&s;e then, that the Game&s;ters &s;et upon the Thirteen different Cards, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly follow, that the la&s;t Card but
<PB N="20" REF="14">one is clear Gains to the Bank, in that the Dealer cannot loo&s;e the la&s;t Card, which is a <HI>ne v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> pas; be&s;ides, if all the Twelve Cards go every Deal, let 'em loo&s;e or win, one Card or other of the Thirteen will be fa&s;s'd; Judge therefore how great an advantage the Bank has. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it does not &s;o happen, that they &s;et upon the Thirteen differ|rent Cards every Deal, and that the Cards are not always well mixt, but that &s;ometimes Two or Three of a &s;ort &s;hall come to|gether, and at other times the Dealer's Card does not come till the Six la&s;t <HI>Taillie&egrave;s;</HI> yet take it one time with another, the Bank has certainly a very great advantage; the&s;e Rea&s;ons, to|gether with the Reflection &s;he made, upon how much &s;he had lo&s;t at that Game, made her re|&s;olve
<PB N="21" REF="14">for the future to leave it off. The Marqui&s;s finding her in a right Temper for his de&s;ign, propos'd to her to have <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> at her Hou&s;e, that &s;he &s;hou'd keep the Bank, recommending to her the <HI>Chevalier Brierie,</HI> as one who wou'd be glad to have a &s;hare in it, as a Man of a gene|ral Acquaintance in <HI>Paris,</HI> and one who wou'd bring 'em Game|&s;ters enough. Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> lik'd the Motion, and readily a|greed to it; and, after a little pau&s;e, &s;he hinted to the Marqui&s;s that with her late lo&s;&s;es &s;he was quite run out of her Money, yet that there was a Merchant &s;he us'd to deal with, who up|on &s;ome Allowance, and defalca|tion for Intere&s;t, wou'd accept of an A&s;&s;ignment upon one of her Tenants, and advance her the next Years Rent upon it.
<PB N="22" REF="15">The Marqui&s;s offer'd to lay down the Money, and make a Bank for her; which &s;he refus'd, but bor|row'd Three hundred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors</HI> of her Merchant, to which the Marqui&s;s put Three hundred more, and the Chevalier as ma|ny; &s;o that they made up a Bank of Nine hundred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors.</HI> What with the pains the Chevalier took to divulge it, and the Reputation of the Per&s;ons concern'd, it was quickly known all the Town over; Game&s;ters came from all parts, and the ve|ry &s;econd time they Dealt, there was &s;o great a Crowd, that not|with&s;tanding the Table held above Thirty, there were &s;everal that cou'd get no room. The Marqui&s;s taillied, and Madam <HI>Londroze,</HI> and the Chevalier crouppied. Sure nothing could be more Entertaining, than to

<PB N="26" REF="17">in that Point, and my Husbanb, poor Man, who fancies him&s;elf a Conjurer, knows no more of that matter than another Man. In the mean time one of the Footmen coming with a Candle, the Cheva|lier &s;tole away, as fearing to be &s;een. Another time a young Lady betwixt Seventeen and Eighteen, hand&s;om and well dre&s;s'd, being at play, and having very bad luck, the Chevalier over-&s;aw her Card &s;everal times; which Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> taking notice of, watch'd it the more narrow|ly; at la&s;t, after the lo&s;s of Two and twenty <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors,</HI> &s;he went away very di&s;contentedly; whereupon the Chevalier fol|lowing her, over-heard an Old Woman &s;aying to her, Have not I often warn'd you of the danger of Play? What think you will your Mother &s;ay when
<PB N="27" REF="17">&s;he &s;ees you without the Pety|coat?

You have done finely, han't you? for my part I look for nothing le&s;s than being turn'd out of Doors. Im|mediately the Chevalier addre&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf to the young La|dy, told her he had over-heard their Di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;&s;uring her how much troubled he was at her lo&s;s, it being no fault of his that &s;he had not won, and that her Card had not been over &s;een every time. At fir&s;t the young Lady blu&s;h'd, but the Chevalier proferr'd to lend her &s;ome Mo|ney with &s;o much Importunity, that, notwith&s;tanding the many refu&s;als &s;he made, he at la&s;t in

He was with her a great while all alone. The next day &s;he was engaged at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> and &s;o for &s;everal days together. She never was without Money.

Another time, a Friend of the Chevalier's had ju&s;t &s;et his Foot into the Room where they were Dealing, when of a &s;udden he drew back to avoid being &s;een; the Chevalier made after him, and pre&s;&s;ed him to come in; he de&s;ir'd to be excu&s;ed, but the Chevalier being very earne&s;t with him to know the Rea&s;on his Friend ask'd him, Did you, &s;aid he, mind the Old Gentle|man that &s;at next you? yes, re|ply'd the Chevalier; know then, &s;aid he, that he is worth Eight hundred thou&s;and <HI>Livres,</HI> and has three Daughters to mar|ry, that he goes about to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> Tables only to take no|tice who comes there, and if he finds any one that courts any of his Daughters at play he po&s;itively commands her, to
<PB N="30" REF="19">whom the Court is made, to break off with her Lover, and forbid him the Hou&s;e, prote&s;ting that no <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI>-player &s;hall ever marry any Daughter of his. Now I being very well with the Elde&s;t, and in no &s;mall hopes of getting her, &s;he gave me this Advice, which I'm re&s;olv'd to follow. The Chevalier being &s;atisfied with this Rea&s;on, and going back into the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> Room, fell a rallying &s;o &s;everely upon the Old Gentleman, that he ob|lig'd him to quit the Room, as looking upon him to be one that wou'd hinder their Cu|&s;tom.</P>
<P>Nothing can be a &s;tronger In&s;tance, to how great Extra|vagances the love of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> may &s;ubject one, than what hapen'd to the young Count <HI>de Angluron;</HI> he was a Friend of the Cheva|lier's
<PB N="31" REF="19">who meeting him one day in Town, ask'd him how chanc't, he, that was &s;o great a lover of Play, had now quite left it off: The young Count told him, he was now wholly taken up another way; for that he was fallen de&s;perately in Love with one of the mo&s;t Beautiful Creatures in all <HI>France,</HI> of whom he was likewi&s;e not a little belov'd; that his Pa&s;&s;ion for her had perfectly cur'd him of that for Play. The Chevalier told him there was <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> at Ma|dam <HI>Landrozes,</HI> whether Peo|ple of the be&s;t Fa&s;hion in Town did daily re&s;ort, and invited him to it, and to bring his Mi&s;tre&s;s along with him.</P>
<P>Next day the Count and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Ro|ziers</HI> and the Chevalier, were at Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> very merry
<PB N="32" REF="20">together; but being too &s;oon to begin to Deal, they fell into a Di&s;|cour&s;e about play. Madam <HI>Landro|ze</HI> &s;aid, He that was given to play cou'd never make a good Lover, or be very ob&s;ervant to his Mi|&s;tre&s;s. The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Roziers</HI> was of Opinion one might ea&s;i|ly di&s;engage him&s;elf from the love of play: In an&s;wer to which, the Chevalier in a rallying way &s;aid, that whoever has once plac'd his Affections upon play, can never wean him&s;elf from it as long as he lives. The Count <HI>de Angluron</HI> was for maintaining the contrary, and looking lan|gui&s;hing upon his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid, That from his own Experience he cou'd prove, that Love was an infallible cure for any Inclina|tion to play. And for my part, reply'd his fair Mi&s;tre&s;s, I think any Woman very ingrateful that
<PB N="33" REF="20">can't be of the &s;ame Mind. The Chevalier, for the Je&s;t &s;ake, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in it, that no Man who, loves <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> can ever leave it off for a Mi&s;tre&s;s; a Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid he, may perhaps requite her Lover for the many Torments &s;he makes him endure; but can &s;he at any time give him a <HI>Pa|roli,</HI> a <HI>Sept,</HI> a <HI>Quinze,</HI> or a <HI>Trent-et-le-va?</HI> No! no! never was any Ladies favour of that Con|&s;equence. By this time the Company being come, they gave over the Di&s;cour&s;e; and the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Roziers</HI> began to Tailli&egrave;e: Do but ob&s;erve now what happen'd to the Count <HI>de Angluron;</HI> this Man, whom Love had &s;o well cur'd of any de&s;ire of play, at fir&s;t play'd but very little, and was taken up rather in watching his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Eyes, than his own Cards; he
<PB N="34" REF="21">lo&s;t 'em every one; then being heated, and in hopes his luck might turn, he &s;et as much up|on a Card at one time, as he had lo&s;t &s;ince he fir&s;t began to play. He lo&s;t it; whereupon he doubl'd and doubl'd on, loo&s;ing &s;ome Cards, and winning o|thers; of every Card that he won, he made the <HI>Paroli</HI> and a <HI>Sept-et-le-va,</HI> which he &s;till lo&s;t; &s;o that after this manner he had plaid off One hundred and fifty <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors.</HI> He went out, and &s;ent for the Chevalier into the next Room, where he profer'd to &s;ell him his Coach and Hor|&s;es. The Chevalier thought it a good Bargain, and bought 'em: This Money was as little lucky to the Count, for he &s;oon lo&s;t it. A &s;econd time he &s;ent for the Chevalier out into the next Room, to &s;ell him his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="35" REF="21">Diamond Cla&s;ps. The Cheva|lier at fir&s;t was unwilling, but the Count, as al&s;o his Mi&s;tre&s;s, in complai&s;ance to him, did &s;o pre&s;s and importune him to it, that at la&s;t the Chevalier bought the Diamond Cla&s;ps. That Money lo&s;t, he &s;old the Pearl Necklace too, as little lucky as the re&s;t. The Count <HI>de Anglu|ron</HI> grown de&s;perate with all the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, taking the Cheva|lier a&s;ide, pray'd him to let him have &s;ome Money upon his Note, prote&s;ting &s;olemnly he wou'd re|pay it in two or three days: The Chevalier &s;eem'd not to mind him, having made an Oath ne|ver more to lend a Farthing without a Pawn, by rea&s;on of &s;ome di&s;putes he had lately had with &s;ome of his be&s;t Friends upon the like occa&s;ion. Well, &s;aid the Count, in a great con|cern,
<PB N="36" REF="22">will you lend it me if I pawn to you the thing of the World I value mo&s;t, and which I wou'd Redeem at the expence of my Life; 'tis that Beautiful Creature that came along with me, I will leave her in your hands, till &s;uch time as I have repay'd you to a Farthing of what &s;hall borrow; doubt not, my dear Chevalier, but &s;ome time before the end of the Week you &s;hall have your Money, and in the mean time I &s;hall take it as the greate&s;t Obligation imagi|nable. The Chevalier &s;urprized to hear of &s;uch a kind of Pawn, and calling to mind that he had but ju&s;t before heard the Count maintain, that Love was an In|fallible cure for any Inclination to play, was &s;o pleas'd with this Pa&s;&s;age, that 'twas as much as he cou'd do to forbear laugh|ing
<PB N="37" REF="22">out right. He told the Count very coldly, that he cou'd not take that Pawn, for what, &s;aid he, wou'd you have me do with that young Woman? What would I have you do with her, replyed the Count? Alas! what &s;hou'd one do with &s;o precious a Pawn? What &s;ou'd one do? do by her like a Man of Honour; whereupon the Chevalier de&s;ir'd him to think no more on't. Go then, &s;aid the Count, pulling his Hat over his Eyes, and turning &s;hort from him, you have dealt un|worthily by me, and I'll declare it to all the World, you don't play like a Gentleman; &s;o flung out of doors, without &s;o much as thinking of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who all this while was &s;eeing 'em play at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> and forc'd to walk home on foot, the Coach
<PB N="38" REF="23">and Hor&s;es having been not long before &s;old and deliver'd up.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal other no le&s;s plea&s;ant Pa&s;&s;ages at this <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI>-Bank, which I purpo&s;e|ly forbear to take notice of, that I may come to &s;peak of the Pa&s;&s;ion which the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Roziers</HI> had for Madam <HI>Lan|droze.</HI> The Count <HI>de Chariots</HI> hearing of the va&s;t Sums of Mo|ney which this Bank had won, had a Curio&s;ity to know how well the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Roziers</HI> had &s;ucceeded in the advice he gave him to gain Madam <HI>La|drozes</HI> Heart; and to that end he made him a Vi&s;it. She is wonderfully pleas'd, &s;aid the Marqui&s;s, and is often counting over the great gains &s;he has made by the Bank. She's al|ways in good Humour, and when
<PB N="39" REF="23">we are by our &s;elves, we rally&egrave;e upon tho&s;e who&s;e Money we win; but as for what Advances I have made, towards the Ma|&s;tery of her Heart, they are lit|tle more than what I made the very fir&s;t day. Do not you Marqui&s;s, &s;aid the Count, make the right u&s;e of her being in good Humour, and wait for the Critical Minute? Believe me, reply'd the Marqui&s;s, I loo&s;e nothing for want of a&s;&s;urance, but &s;he puts me by, and rebukes me with &s;o much Indignation, that I often begin to de&s;pair. Is it, &s;aid &s;he, once to me, be|cau&s;e I &s;ometimes vouch&s;afe you my Company at play, that there|fore you pre&s;ume to take this Liberty? Very fine! indeed Mon&s;ieur Marqui&s;s, that is not like to be the Price of our Bank. Therefore Count, continued the
<PB N="40" REF="24">Marqui&s;s, to deal plainly with you, yours has fail'd, &s;o that I mu&s;t now think of &s;ome other way. Well, reply'd the Count, I'll tell you one, that can't po&s;|&s;ibly fail; Contrive all you can to loo&s;e, and quite ruin the Bank; put Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> up|on borrowing of every body, up|on pawning all her Jewels and Moveables; &s;he's extrava|gant, and &s;o exce&s;&s;ively fond of Play, that rather then want Mo|ney for <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> there is not any thing &s;he won't &s;ell, pawn, or promi&s;e to do: I'll undertake, that when &s;he's under &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances, &s;he'll be no longer re&s;erv'd to you, and 'twill be in your own power to make your &s;elf Happy. But how, &s;aid the Marqui&s;s, interrupting him, do you mean by ruining our Bank, and what way &s;hou'd I do it?
<PB N="41" REF="24">I mean, reply'd the Count, that you &s;hall agree with &s;ome of your Friends, to come and play deep, while you being to deal, &s;hall &s;o &s;huffle the Cards, as that they may win; then which nothing can be more ea&s;ie, let them make the <HI>Paroli,</HI> the <HI>Sept,</HI> and <HI>Quinze-et-le-va,</HI> and in a &s;hort time, take my Word for't they'll break the Bank, Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> &s;hall borrow of every body, pawn all &s;he can rap and rend for Money to make a new one, which &s;hall have as ill &s;uc|ce&s;s as the former; and never believe me more, if when you have once reduc'd her to that Condition, you do not find her more Affable and Courteous; if you are unwilling to intru&s;t a Secret of this Nature to any of your own Friends, I'll help you to &s;ome fit Per&s;ons, and en|gage
<PB N="42" REF="25">the Chevalier to joyn with you in this thing; for he's a Man no ways nice in the&s;e Matters, provided he &s;uffer not in point of Intere&s;t. Ah!

I cheat Madam <HI>Lan|droze,</HI> a Per&s;on I doat on above all things in this World? Think you I can be &s;o hard-hearted, as to bear up again&s;t tho&s;e Af|flictions, which the being redu|ced to &s;uch Extremities mu&s;t inevitably throw her into? No! no! Count, you don't know me; and let me a&s;&s;ure you, I had ra|ther de&s;pair of ever obtaining any favour from her, then purcha&s;e it that rate.

The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Roziers</HI> having better con&s;i|der'd of the Propo&s;al, and the
<PB N="44" REF="26">Rea&s;ons wherewith the Count <HI>de Charlois</HI> had enforc'd it, ap|proved of it very well. The Per&s;ons who were to manage it came to the Marqui&s;s to re|ceive their In&s;tructions; the Chevalier being a&s;&s;ur'd by the Count, that there was no|thing intended but a piece of Gallantry, and that Madam <HI>Lan|droze</HI> &s;hou'd have her Money a|gain, readily a&s;&s;ented to it: As for the Marqui&s;s, all his Bu&s;ine&s;s was practicing to &s;huffle the Cards, and to remember what the Count had taught him. They agreed among&s;t them&s;elves what Cards &s;hou'd win, and the Marqui&s;s's Valet de Chambre, who waited at the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> Ta|ble, and to whom it belong'd to bring his Ma&s;ter the Cards when he dealt, had his Le&s;&s;on given him how to place 'em:
<PB N="45" REF="26">In fine, matters were &s;o well manag'd, that at the third &s;et|ting down, the Bank was quite broke, and the Per&s;ons de&s;ign'd won all the Money. Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> immediately pawn'd all her Jewels, Plate, Furniture, and whatever el&s;e &s;he cou'd make Money of to &s;et up a new Bank, which held out not above four &s;ettings. The next Day af|ter this &s;econd Bank was broke, the Marqui&s;s made her a Vi&s;it a|bout the time they us'd to begin play.

Words are too weak &s;ymptoms of a bleed|ing Heart, that is ever attended with more violent ones; here then, I give my &s;elf up to your De&s;ires, do with me as you think fit; Inhuman Creditor! pay your &s;elf, come, Cruel, as thou art! Why do&s;t thou &s;tand off? then
<PB N="52" REF="30">looking langui&s;hing on him with Tears in her Eyes, &s;he threw her &s;elf at his Feet; Pardon &s;aid &s;he, pardon, my dear Mar|qui&s;s, I am &s;en&s;ible you have too much Honour to u&s;e any force, and if I refu&s;e you at pre&s;ent, impute it only to the &s;truglings of a di&s;abled Virtue, ju&s;t yield|ing to the power of Love.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he had &s;aid the&s;e Words, the Chevalier <HI>Brierie</HI> came into the Room, and found her at the Marqui&s;s's Feet; but &s;he hearing &s;ome body tread very &s;oftly behind her, and perceiving in the Gla&s;s ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to her, that 'twas the Chevalier, con|tinued &s;till at the Marqui&s;s's Feet, and &s;eeming as tho' &s;he had not &s;een the Chevalier, immediate|ly turn'd the Di&s;cour&s;e in this manner. No! Sir, No, I'm re|&s;olv'd never to ri&s;e from this Po|&s;ture,
<PB N="53" REF="30">till you have promis'd me not to fight with my Brother. I ask you a thou&s;and Pardons for whatever he has &s;aid to you, he's a pa&s;&s;ionate hot-brain'd Fellow, and grown de&s;perate to find him|&s;elf oblig'd to repay me the Mo|ney I lent him. As &s;he was &s;ay|ing the&s;e Words, &s;he turn'd her Head about to the Chevalier on a &s;udden, &s;eeming to wonder what noi&s;e &s;he heard; then, as tho' &s;urpris'd to &s;ee him there, &s;he &s;tarted up on a &s;udden, having fir&s;t wink'd upon the Marqui&s;s to withdraw, which accordingly he did, but in &s;o great a hurry and confu&s;ion, at what had late|ly befallen him, that he had much a do to find his way home. Ah! dear Chevalier, &s;aid Madam <HI>Lan|droze</HI> very heavily, I am undone, I am the mo&s;t unfortunate Crea|ture on Earth, if you don't take
<PB N="54" REF="31">pity on me; for the love of God u&s;e all the intere&s;t you have with the Marqui&s;s not to fight with my Brother; but Oh! that thoughtful and re&s;erv'd Look, which he went away with, has da&s;h'd all my hopes, for I have ever ob&s;erv'd it to be the &s;ure&s;t &s;ign of a revengeful Temper. Feigning at la&s;t to come to her &s;elf &s;he told the Chevalier 'twou'd have done her a great kindne&s;s, had he hapen'd to come but a Minute &s;ooner; that having lo&s;t her Money at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> &s;he was forc'd to dun her Brother for what he ow'd her; who there|upon brought her that Bag which he &s;aw upon the Bed, &s;hewing him that which the Marqui&s;s laid there that her Brother fell very &s;evere upon her for playing at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> which kept her al|ways at home, that &s;he was
<PB N="45" REF="31">peek'd at it, and &s;o they came to high Words, that in the heat of the Di&s;pute the Marqui&s;s ve|ry unfortunately came in, and offer'd to take her part; at which her Brother was &s;o incens'd, that they fell to Words, and in the Pa&s;&s;ion they were in, but for the re&s;pect the Marqui&s;s had to her, they had drawn upon each other in her Chamber; that her Bro|ther went out fir&s;t threatning the Marqui&s;s, that &s;he had done all &s;he cou'd to prevent the Mar|qui&s;s from following him; yet that &s;he was &s;till in a perpetual fright of what might en&s;ue hereupon. The Chevalier with all his cunning was caught in the Trap, and being naturally impatient, after having promis'd to do her what Service he cou'd in this matter, he immediately took his leave of her. He un|der&s;tood
<PB N="56" REF="32">at the Lodgings, where Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Brother lay, that he went out in the Morn|ing early, and had not dined at home; as for the Marqui&s;s he was but ju&s;t gone to bed, and had left word if any body came he was not to be &s;poken with. This confirm'd the Chevalier in what Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> had ju&s;t before told him, and made him try to prevent the mi&s;chief which he thought he luckily fore&s;aw. The Marqui&s;s tho in Bed, as they told the Chevalier, was &s;o far from being a&s;leep, that 'tis not to be imagin'd, how re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;tracted his Thoughts were; when he re|flected upon tho&s;e tender and pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions where|with Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> had lately Entertain'd him, he was Tran|&s;ported with Joy even to a de|gree
<PB N="57" REF="32">of Madne&s;s. What, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, does Madam <HI>Lan|droze</HI> love me, and conceal it on|ly to pre&s;erve me more con&s;tant to her? Is it po&s;&s;ible that all tho&s;e Cruelties I've indur'd from her, &s;hou'd be only the Effects of a melancholy Apprehen&s;ion, lea&s;t I did not love her &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately as &s;he cou'd wi&s;h? Yes! yes! neither the lo&s;s of Reputation, or fear of what might happen, cou'd with-hold her from giving her &s;elf up to me to do what I wou'd with her; 'tis I only that am a trouble to her, lea&s;t what ever &s;he does for me, I &s;hou'd impute rather to De&s;ign, than the free Motives of a di&s;intere&s;t|ed Love. Fear nothing, continu|ed he, &s;hall I ruin your Reputa|tion, &s;hall I, that have &s;o great an Adoration for you, expo&s;e you to the violent Pro&s;ecutions,
<PB N="58" REF="33">and fury of a Jealous Husband? No! no! I renounce the Thoughts of any plea&s;ure that you mu&s;t purcha&s;e at &s;o dear a rate; the enjoyment of your Heart is all I ask, and 'tis that, and only that can make me the happie&s;t or unhappie&s;t Man breathing. Then again, falling headlong from that high Rap|ture into a deep Melancholy, What, &s;aid he, what have I done, to de&s;erve &s;o much kindne&s;s from her? Is it by Treachery, Cruel|ty, and Cheating? What to have betray'd her ba&s;ely, to have been &s;o cruel as to make her loo&s;e her Money, to have &s;een her &s;o reduc'd as to &s;ell her Jewels, Plate, and Furniture, to have &s;tood unmoved at her greate&s;t De&s;pair, to have plaid the Pick-pocket, and hired Peo|ple to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in cheating her?
<PB N="59" REF="33">Are the&s;e the Stratagems to con|quer Hearts? thus, and much more than can be expre&s;s'd, did the Marqui&s;s rave all Night? When he had call'd to mind that he had &s;uffer'd Madam <HI>Lan|droze</HI> to throw her &s;elf at his Feet, he was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and call'd him&s;elf an unmanner|ly Brute; when he con&s;ider'd the Chevalier <HI>Brierie</HI> had &s;urprized him in this Po&s;ture, and over|heard what he &s;aid, he was &s;o confounded that he knew not what to think; he cou'd not ima|gin what Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> meant by de&s;iring him not to fight with her Brother; and how &s;he came off with the Chevalier; and what troubled him yet more, was, that he had taken notice how very ob&s;ervant the Cheva|lier us'd to be to Madam <HI>Lan|droze,</HI> which made him think he
<PB N="60" REF="34">loved her, and mi&s;tru&s;t lea&s;t his Rival, by telling her how &s;he had been cheated, &s;hou'd ruin his Intere&s;t with her to all In|tents and Purpo&s;es; thereupon he thought the &s;afe&s;t way wou'd be to begin fir&s;t, and throw him|&s;elf at her Feet, in hopes to merit his Pardon by a voluntary confe&s;&s;ion of the Crime: He thought the Night very tedious, and waited for Day with great impatience to execute his De|&s;ign; at la&s;t the Hour of &s;eeing Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> being come, he was in ha&s;te to be going, but ju&s;t as he got to the Door, he found &s;ome of the Guards there, which a Mar&s;hal of <HI>France</HI> had &s;ent; 'tis not to be imagin'd, how wonderfully troubled and &s;urprized he was at &s;o &s;trange a di&s;appointment; he &s;ent pre&s;ent|ly for the Count <HI>de Charlois</HI> to un|fold
<PB N="61" REF="34">this My&s;tery to him. The Count under&s;tood by his Friend the Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> who &s;ent 'em, that the Chevalier <HI>Brierie</HI> had informed him of a Duel that was to be fought by the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Rozeirs,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Li&s;le,</HI> Brother to Madam <HI>Lan|droze,</HI> upon a Quarrel that hap|ned lately betwixt 'em. There|upon he went to the Chevalier, who told him how he had found Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> at the Maqui&s;s's Feet, and all that &s;he had &s;aid to him. The Count returning to the Marqui&s;s complain'd of his unkindne&s;s in not acquainting him with the late bu&s;ine&s;s be|twixt him and <HI>Li&s;le.</HI> The Mar|qui&s;s, who did not then call to mind that <HI>Li&s;le</HI> was Madam <HI>Lan|droze's</HI> Brother, and what &s;he had &s;aid to him upon the Che|valier's &s;urprizing her at his
<PB N="62" REF="35">Feet, prote&s;ted to him with a thou&s;and &s;olemn Imprecations, he was &s;o far from having had any late di&s;pute with <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> as that he had not either &s;poken to, or &s;o much as &s;een him this Twelvemonth. If what you &s;ay be true, reply'd the Count, ei|ther the Chevalier is the greate&s;t Impo&s;tor, or Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> the mo&s;t deceitful and de&s;igning Woman alive. Afterwards the Marqui&s;s, as he was telling him of &s;ome particular Pa&s;&s;ages that happen'd the day before at her Hou&s;e, began to remember, how upon the Chevalier's &s;urprizing her at his Feet, &s;he intreated him not to fight with her Bro|ther, and made &s;igns to him to withdraw; which accordingly he did, leaving the Chevalier with her all alone: This made him &s;en&s;ible of the Truth of
<PB N="63" REF="35">what had been told him, and con&s;idering how &s;erviceable the Count might be to him on this occa&s;ion, he told him ingeniou&s;ly every particular Circum&s;tance of the whole Affair, and de&s;ir'd his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance therein. Forthwith the Count went to the Chevalier, a&s;&s;uring him the bu&s;i|ne&s;s was made up, and that 'twas for Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Credit that it &s;hou'd not take Air; &s;o they went together to te&s;tifie the &s;ame to the Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> and to get an Order for recal|ling the Guards. This order came very opportunely, for they who were &s;ent to &s;erve <HI>Li&s;le</HI> had not as yet been with him; but &s;taying to drink a Gla&s;s of Wine at a Tavern-next Door to his Lodgings, there they received the Countermand. The Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Roziers</HI> was in a con|tinual
<PB N="64" REF="36">fright at what Madam <HI>Landroze's</HI> Brother wou'd think of the matter, and the great prejudice it might be to her Re|putation. As &s;oon as the Count <HI>de Chariots</HI> had brought him an account of the happy &s;ucce&s;s of his Negotiation, he fell into a Di&s;cour&s;e about Madam <HI>Londro|ze's</HI> death: Marqui&s;s, &s;aid the Count, where was your Wit to loo&s;e&punc; &s;o fair an opportunity? Troth, I know not what to make of you, thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy &s;elf in her Opinion beyond all hope of recovery; for let me tell thee, all &s;uch faults are un|pardonable with Women. Is it po&s;&s;ible thou &s;hould&s;t come to this Age, and not know that Women u&s;e &s;uch little Tricks, only to decoy and bring Men on with greater eagerne&s;s, Count, reply'd the Marqui&s;s very brisk|ly,
<PB N="65" REF="36">if you knew Madam <HI>Lan|droze</HI> you'd be of soother mind. She's all Truth, of a tender Di&s;|po&s;ition, Generous, uncapable of any little Trick, and endued with a thou&s;and other extraor|dinary Accompli&s;hments, which few ether Women cou'd ever pretend to; nay I know her Temper &s;o well, that &s;he can lea&s;t defend her &s;elf again&s;t that way of Court&s;hip I have always u&s;ed to her: I have ever &s;acri|ficed my Will to her Intere&s;t and Plea&s;ure, whereby &s;he is a&s;&s;ured how much I love her better than my own Life; 'Tis &s;uffi|cient to &s;ecure her to me as long as &s;he lives. Alas! Marqui&s;s, &s;aid the Count, &s;hrugging up his Shoulders, you'll never do any great Feats among&s;t the Women; the way, continued he, to have
<PB N="66" REF="37">gain'd Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> and kept her &s;ure to you as long as you'd a mind to't, bad been to have made u&s;e of the opportu|nity &s;he gave you; 'tis by that, as by &s;ome &s;ecret Charm, a Man gets &s;o great an a&s;endant over a Womans mind, that &s;he can deny him nothing, humours him in all things, falls out with the whole World in his Cau&s;e is carele&s;s of her carriage to her Husband, or the concerns of her Family, values not her Reputa|tion: In fine, if her Gallant be but a bold experienc'd Sinner &s;he enters in without the lea&s;t reluctancy, and &s;tops at no Crime tho never &s;o execrable. What you &s;ay Count, reply'd the Marqui&s;s, is very true of lew'd debauch'd Women, and &s;uch as have lo&s;t all &s;ence of Repueati|on;
<PB N="67" REF="37">but all Women are not un|der &s;uch Circum&s;tances, and Ma|dam <HI>Landroze,</HI> of whom we were &s;peaking, lea&s;t of any Woman in all <HI>France.</HI> Once more, re|ply'd the Count, I mu&s;t needs tell you, I find you do not know the Sex; there are hardly any, and e&s;pecially Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> but what are Fanta&s;tical in their Amours; they &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be hurried away I know not how: When ever they love or hate, they can give no Rea&s;on for either, but are equally in|clin'd to both by a whim&s;ical and unaccountable Humour; they are true to nothing, but their In|tere&s;t, or when they want an Opportunity to be fal&s;e; they are naturally Coquets, and their affected Virtue is nothing but a Cloak to their Coquettry.
<PB N="68" REF="38">They have de&s;ign in all they &s;ay or do; but above all Tears are the Ma&s;terpiece of their Cun|ing, and the &s;ure&s;t Baits to catch the warie&s;t Cudgeons. Though I, continued the Count, defie even tho&s;e, as well as all others, and what I now tell you, I have either had experience of, or ob|&s;erved in mo&s;t Women. I have known 'em leave very worthy de&s;erving Per&s;ons, whom they once had a great kindne&s;s for, and who have had no le&s;s for them, to take up with pittiful incon&s;iderable Fellows: Some|times becau&s;e they either danc'd or &s;ung well; &s;ometimes being dazled with the glittering of a rich Embroidred Coat, a well fancied Equipage, or a hundred other &s;uch fanta&s;tical Rea&s;ons. One day a married Woman, la|menting
<PB N="69" REF="38">the lo&s;s of her Lover, who was kill'd in the War, &s;aid to me, Alas! poor Youth, how lovely he was, and how dearly he lov'd me? How often have we ran the Balls together? How often has he carried me to Plays? then fetching a deep Sigh, Oh! unfortunate Wretch, &s;aid &s;he, that I am! Farewel Balls, fare|wel Plays, they are all over with me, for who is there now that will carry me to 'em? No! no! I &s;hall never &s;ee any more. An|other time a Widow, the very fir&s;t year of her Mourning, view|ing her &s;elf in the Gla&s;s, &s;aid to me (as I was &s;tanding by) with Tears in her Eyes, Ah! Sir, what a lo&s;s have I had of my Husband? At which I began &s;e|riou&s;ly to Comfort her: Com|fort, reply'd &s;he &s;ighing, talk
<PB N="70" REF="39">not to me of Comfort; &s;ee what an ill Air this Bandore has, bow frightful this plain Linning makes me appear? What Man will endure now to look upon me? when I han't patience to &s;ee my &s;elf in the Gla&s;s?</P>
<P>But to &s;ay no more of other Women, let's come to Madam <HI>Landroze.</HI> What think you of the Artifice &s;he u&s;ed to blind the Chevalier, of the Rea&s;on why he found her at your Feet? For my part, I think it a Ma&s;terpeice to &s;ee a come-off, &s;o well contriv'd, and acted &s;o to the Life on a &s;udden. Well! well! Count, re|ply'd the Marqui&s;s, let's have no more on't, you have &s;aid enough, and I verily believe you are &s;o great a Woman hater, that, &s;hou'd I let you run on, you'd
<PB N="71" REF="39">reap up the Story of the <HI>Ephe&s;ian</HI> Matron, 'tis not in this, con|tinu'd he, I ask your advice, but what I &s;hou'd do with Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> as to the Moneys I made her loo&s;e, for I have &s;till in my Hands above Eight hun|dred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors</HI> of hers, over and above the Twelve hundred I left with her that day the Chevalier found her upon her Knees. He told him he thought he had great rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the Chevalier, that he was in a continual fright, lea&s;t he &s;hou'd betray him in making a di&s;cove|ry to Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> which wou'd ruin him in her Opini|on to all Intents and Purpo&s;es; that he had thoughts to prevent it by re&s;toring to her what Mo|ney he had of hers, and ma|king an open Confe&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="72" REF="40">whole matter, in hopes &s;he may pardon it as the ra&s;h Act of a violent Pa&s;&s;ion. The Count was of another mind, he main|tain'd there was no Rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the Chevalier, that &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion can never take with Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> who will infallibly look upon the whole de&s;ign to be no better than a down-right Cheat, that the better way were, to let her win it back again the &s;ame way &s;he lo&s;t it; that if he was in ha&s;te to have it done, he might make a match to taill&egrave;e at her Hou&s;e to day, that he &s;hou'd return the Money to the &s;ame Per&s;ons that won it before, and appoint 'em to be there on pur|po&s;e to loo&s;e it back again, by which means they will &s;ee plainly, he did not de&s;ign Chea|ting;
<PB N="73" REF="40">and &s;hou'd the Chevalier chance to &s;peak on't, as he mi&s;|tru&s;ted, the Event was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tifie the Act. Be&s;ides, &s;aid he, if the Town &s;hould come to talk of a Quarrel be|tween you and Madam <HI>Landro|ze's</HI> Brother, when they &s;ee you Taillying at her Hou&s;e, 'twill be look't upon as an idle Report, and &s;oon be forgotten. The Marqui&s;s approved of what was &s;aid. The Count went to the Chevalier, and the other Per|&s;ons who were to loo&s;e the Money, to acquaint 'em with the de&s;ign, and give 'em the Money, with all Orders nece&s;&s;ary there|unto. Then he gave notice to &s;everal other Game&s;ters that there would be <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> at Ma|dam <HI>Landroze's</HI> about Six of the Clock. As for the Marqui&s;s he
<PB N="74" REF="41">went to Madam <HI>Landroze's,</HI> and told her what the Chevalier had &s;aid to the Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> how they &s;ent &s;ome of the Guards to him, and what bad hapen'd thereupon. Afterwards he propo&s;ed to her the taillying at her Hou&s;e about Six of the Clock: She de&s;ir'd nothing more then to play, and was only troub|led that they did not begin two Hours &s;ooner.</P>
<P>There chanc't to be a great deal of good Company there that day, who de&s;ign'd to play deep: But ju&s;t as the Marqui&s;s had drawn out the Bank mo|ney, in order to Talli&egrave;e, and the Setters made choice of their Cards, they heard a great noi&s;e in the Street, they &s;aw a pub|lick Officer with a Trumpet be|fore him, and a piece of Parch|ment
<PB N="75" REF="41">in his Hand, in the mid&s;t of a great crow'd, and heard him pronounce the Word <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> &s;everal times, but cou'd make nothing of what he &s;aid. Mean while the Company being greatly puzzl'd to know the meaning on't, in came an Old Gentleman, Husband to a young Lady who was then pre&s;ent, and had &s;et &s;everal <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors</HI> upon a Card: With great Joy in his Looks, he told 'em, it was an Order of Council to forbid <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett;</HI> then looking a little angrily, he commanded his Wife not to play; &s;he laught at him, and the more he forbid her, the more pre&s;&s;ing &s;he was with the Marqui&s;s to deal on: The Penalty of the Order, &s;aid he, is Five hundred <HI>Livres</HI> for|feiture upon every one that
<PB N="76" REF="42">plays, Three thou&s;and upon him that keeps the Bank, and the Hou&s;e where they play to be &s;hut up. This perplex'd and madded all the Company. Ma|dam <HI>Landroze</HI> was for rallying it off, and &s;aid, &s;he liked the Company too well to &s;hut her Doors again&s;t 'em. The Mar|qui&s;s was loath to incur the For|feiture of Three thou&s;and <HI>Livres.</HI> The Chevalier, enraged at the Order, was very po&s;itive, and of|fer'd to lay Five hundred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors,</HI> one might &s;afely play the re&s;t of that day; however there being few of his Mind, they broke up and went away with|out it. As they were going off, he endeavour'd to per&s;wade 'em to come back, but finding it to no purpo&s;e, told 'em, that the forbidding <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> was of a
<PB N="77" REF="42">mighty con&s;equence, which he was de&s;irous to communicate to 'em, and therefore invited 'em all to Supper. The Ladies, and all tho&s;e Gentlemen who were Strangers to the Chevalier, thank'd him for his Invitation, and went away, while &s;uch as were his Friends and Acquain|tance, went along with him to the <HI>Petit-Paris,</HI> where he be|&s;poke a Supper. The Marqui&s;s promis'd the Chevalier to be there as &s;oon as he. In the mean time, as the Company were taking their leaves, he counted over his Money, and put Eight hundred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors</HI> in a Pur&s;e by it &s;elf. Then find|ing him&s;elf alone with Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> he offer'd her the Pur&s;e, in which the Eight hundred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors</HI> were, confe&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="78" REF="43">whole Cheat, in hopes &s;he wou'd pardon him, and look upon't as the exce&s;s of Love. While he was &s;peaking. Madam <HI>Landroze</HI> turn'd &s;ometimes pale, &s;ometimes red, and chang'd Col|lour above a hundred times. What, &s;aid &s;he, to him, reaching out her Hand to take the Pur&s;e, is it po&s;&s;ible? and are the&s;e Eight hundred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors,</HI> and the Twelve hundred you left here ye&s;terday, my own? Which the Marqui&s;s a&s;&s;uring her: Well, &s;aid &s;he to him, you are a Man of Honour, and I forgive you freely; in full a&s;&s;urance whereof, as likewi&s;e how much I look upon my &s;elf to be intere&s;ted in any thing that concerns you, I will make you an intire Confi|dent in all my Thoughts. Ah! Madam, &s;aid the Marqui&s;s, in|terrupting
<PB N="79" REF="43">her, how good and how obliging you are, and how &s;en&s;ible am I of it; nay fur|ther, continued &s;he, I'll give you advice which makes again&s;t my &s;elf, and if you're wife you'll follow it: but for fear any body &s;hou'd come in, and &s;urprize me with this Pur&s;e in my Hand, let me go lock it in my Cabinet: which accordingly &s;he did, and being come back again; Troth, Marqui&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, I had a narrow e&s;cape ye&s;terday, for my ill For|tune at play had reduced me to &s;o great an Extremity, that I prote&s;t I had not the power to deny you any thing you cou'd ask me: But thanks to Provi|dence, and my own little Cun|ning, I am now &s;afe deli|ver'd. But withal, Sir, continu|ed &s;he, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay you
<PB N="80" REF="44">have not lo&s;t much by't; for whatever you had done with my Per&s;on, I had from my very Heart dete&s;ted the Action, and lookt upon it only as a hard Ran&s;om, to Redeem me out of that Slavery whereinto my late Lo&s;&s;es had unfortunately thrown me. Know Marqui&s;s that my Affections are otherwi&s;e enga|ged, and that too, to the mo&s;t ungrateful Man breathing, one, who once had, or at lea&s;t counterfeited a &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion for me; and oh! if 'twas coun|terfeited, 'twas done to the Life; one, who has a thou&s;and times &s;worn to love me as long as he liv'd: However the Traytor has proved fal&s;e, and what is yet wor&s;e, Fal&s;hood has been &s;o far from curing me of my Love, that it has rather increas'd it
<PB N="81" REF="44">the more. Once when I upbraid|ed him with his Ingratitude, and beg'd him to return to the Pa&s;|&s;ion he formerly had for me; Cou'd I, &s;aid he, Ah! Madam, how gladly would I do't? Can there be a greater Happine&s;s in the World, than that of loving where one is belov'd; but we are not &s;o much Ma&s;ters of our own Hearts, I value you above any Per&s;on breathing, and wou'd readily &s;acrifice my Life and Fortune to your Service; but I beg you not to exact the Tribute of a Heart which is not in my own power to di&s;po&s;e of: A hundred, and a hundred times have I call'd my &s;elf perjur'd and ingrateful, and blu&s;h'd at the &s;hame of &s;o infamous a Cha|racter; but how in vain are all &s;uch Attacks, upon a Heart re|&s;olv'd
<PB N="82" REF="45">never to &s;urrender? I thought this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o very ridiculous, that I broke off with my Faithle&s;s Lover, and forbid him from ever more corning near me; and yet Marqui&s;s, 'tis but too great a Truth, and what I have experimented up|on you, that the Heart is a head &s;trong Libertine, that will love only where it plea&s;es. How often have I, to the mo&s;t advantage that cou'd be, re|minded my &s;elf of the great Ob|ligations I owe you, of your high Merit, and Pa&s;&s;ionate Af|fections for me, with frequent Sugge&s;tions to my &s;elf, how happy I &s;hou'd be in your Love, cou'd I but love you again? I en|deavour'd by &s;uch gentle Stra|tagems as the&s;e, to &s;urprize my Heart, and make it come over
<PB N="83" REF="45">to you, till having by degrees got a Habit of loving you, it &s;hou'd declare for you again&s;t that perfidious Man your Rival: but &s;o &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s were all tho&s;e Stratagems, that they recoyl'd upon me, and what ever my Rea&s;on made u&s;e of to &s;treng|then your intere&s;t, my Heart in|&s;en&s;ibly turn'd to the advantage of that ingrateful Man. Judge now what endeavours I've u&s;ed to per&s;wade my &s;elf to love you, and to how little purpo&s;e they have all been: 'Tis not Choice or Rea&s;on that governs the Heart, but being bya&s;s'd by it knows not what, it &s;uf|fers it &s;elf to be hurried away with an unaccountable Plea|&s;ure, to it knows not whither, or wherefore; and &s;o &s;trangely contradictory, is the Temper of
<PB N="84" REF="46">tho&s;e who are in Love, that they fondly pur&s;ue their Tor|mentors, and fly from tho&s;e that would make 'em Happy. Oh! Cruelty, reply'd the Marqui&s;s, interrupting her, is it not e|nough to tell me you don't love me, but that I have a Rival whom you do love? Well Marqui&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ince 'tis &s;o, let us try in &s;ome mea&s;ure to alleviate the &s;ecurity of our Fates, you by endeavouring to wean your &s;elf from me, and I by &s;tudying to forget your Rival; &s;ince to love, and not be loved again, is certainly the greate&s;t Plague upon Earth. For Heavens &s;ake, Madam, re|ply'd the Marqui&s;s, teach me the Secret to forget you, 'tis all the Reward I ask, of what|ever I have endur'd for you.
<PB N="85" REF="46">There is a never failing one, &s;aid &s;he, which is never to &s;ee me more, and leave the re&s;t to time. Never to &s;ee you more, Madam, reply'd the Marqui&s;s, to &s;pend Hours, Days, Months, nay Years without &s;eeing you, or &s;o much as ever hoping to &s;ee you more; Ah! what a Cruel Remedy you tell me of, will time, do you &s;ay, work the re&s;t: Alas! how &s;low, and weak a Cure is Time, for &s;o violent a Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the Marqui&s;s had &s;aid this, in came the Chevalier, and told him Supper was ready, and that the Company &s;taid for him; though the Marqui&s;s had a great deal more to &s;ay to Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> yet he was forc'd for that time to take his leave of her; which he did with
<PB N="86" REF="47">&s;o much concern, that he cou'd &s;carce hide it from the Cheva|lier: Wh n he was come to the place where they were to &s;up, he told tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom he had engaged in the de&s;ign a|gain&s;t Madam <HI>Landroze,</HI> that he had re&s;tor'd her all the Money they had won of her, and turn'd it off with a Je&s;t. Whereup|on they gave him the Eight hundred <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors,</HI> which the Count <HI>Charlois</HI> had given them.</P>
<P>Supper being upon the Table, and all the Company going to &s;it down, the Chevalier told 'em he had a matter of great importance to impart to 'em, of which it was highly nece&s;&s;ary that every one &s;hould give his Opinion; that mo&s;t Voices &s;hou'd carry't: in order where|unto
<PB N="87" REF="47">they &s;hou'd chu&s;e a Pre|&s;ident to count 'em, but not be|gin the Debate till the Fruit was upon the Table, and in the mean time to con&s;ider well of the choice. Several Healths went round briskly, at la&s;t the Fruit being &s;et on, the Cheva|lier ask'd the Company if they had thought of a Pre&s;ident, whereat they all, with one Voice, cry'd out they had made Choice of him. Immediately the Chevalier putting on as Grave and Mage&s;terial a Look, as tho' he were Pre&s;ident of the Council, open'd the Se&s;&s;ions in this manner, The defence of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> Sirs, is to be the Subject of our pre&s;ent Debate, and we, being the chief Game&s;ters, whatever Rule we make herein, will be binding to o|thers;
<PB N="88" REF="48">wherefore I de&s;ire every particular Per&s;on may give his advice in this weighty Affair deliberately, and without any prejudice. The fir&s;t thing then to be con&s;ider'd of is, Whether 'tis mo&s;t for our advantage to play at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> or not? And if to play, then &s;econdly, What is to be done to avoid the Order which was this day Proclaimed to the contrary? Begin Mon|&s;ieur <HI>l' Abb&egrave;,</HI> &s;aid the Cheva|lier, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Abb&egrave;e Olarion,</HI> you, whom the World has honour'd with the Glorious Title of Clerk of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> Table: For my part, Sir, &s;aid the <HI>Abb&egrave;,</HI> I'm of Opinion the whole Company has rea&s;on to keep up <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> I've ever found it turn to good Account, and that the Bank mu&s;t be the
<PB N="89" REF="48">only Winner at long run. 'Tis true that <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> is an ill Game for the Setters, but we that are here pre&s;ent, have not &s;o little Wit, as to do any thing but go in the Bank. 'Tis not, continu|ed he &s;miling, but with great labour and pains that I have purchas'd that Glorious Title of Clerk of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> Table; having crouppied day after day, to &s;everal Banks from two of the Clock after Dinner, till Eight at night, and &s;o from Nine till One of the Clock the next Morning: Now I leave it to you to con&s;ider, how &s;trong a Head a Man mu&s;t have to undergo &s;o great a Fateigue. The fir&s;t Point, which is, whe|ther 'tis mo&s;t for our advantage to play at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> being thus clear'd, I come now to the Se|cond,
<PB N="90" REF="49"><HI>viz.</HI> How we may play at it without any danger. This I mu&s;t confe&s;s does a little gra|vel me. There is no Plea&s;ure in being made an Example. At fir&s;t they will be very &s;trict in putting the Law in Execution: in my judgment therefore, 'tis not &s;afe to oppo&s;e them in the heat of their fir&s;t Re&s;olutions, but wart with patience till bet|ter days, which cann't but be e're long, for <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> is too too bewitching a Game, not to draw many of the Nobility and other Per&s;ons of Quality in to play at it, which will &s;erve for a Pre&s;ident to us; and this in &s;hort is what I think of the whole Matter.</P>
<P>Come thou Reverend Judge of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> &s;ays the Chevalier, thou to who&s;e infallible De|ci&s;&s;ion
<PB N="91" REF="49">all difficult and con|trover&s;ial Points of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> are &s;ubmitted with an implicit Faith, let's hear what you &s;ay. I, &s;aid <HI>Chatigny,</HI> am of <HI>Abb&egrave; Olarion</HI>'s Opinion, but cou'd wi&s;h that in the mean time &s;ome Expedient might be found out of playing in &s;ome Noble Mens or Amba&s;&s;adors Hou&s;es, and that &s;ometimes we may have private <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> in our Chambers to keep us in breath. What think you, Noble Cap|tain, &s;ays the Chevalier, you, that as the Town will have it, have been &s;o unfortunate at this Game. I, &s;aid the Captain, for my part, have been &s;o pro|vok'd with <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> that I wi&s;h him hang'd who fir&s;t found it out. Before this Game came up, I and &s;ome others that un|der&s;tood
<PB N="92" REF="50">play pretty well, cou'd now and then pick up a little Money, and &s;trip a well fea|ther'd Bubble without any noi&s;e. But now <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> has &s;o engro&s;s'd the whole Trade, that there is nothing to be got for us poor Brothers of the Die. Now Mon&s;ieur Marqui&s;s, &s;aid the Chevalier, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Ro|ziers,</HI> 'tis your turn to &s;peak. The Marqui&s;s, rouzing him&s;elf as one ju&s;t awak'd out of a dead &s;leep, &s;tair'd upon the Cheva|lier with &s;uch amazement, that the Chevalier &s;aw plainly he knew not what they had been talking of. The Que&s;tion, &s;aid the Chevalier, is whether or no it be for our advantage to play at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett?</HI> The Marqui&s;s pau|&s;ing a while, Never, &s;aid he,
<PB N="93" REF="50">came any good of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> &s;ince it came into <HI>France,</HI> therefore in my Judgment it ought to be bani&s;h'd for ever. But I mu&s;t beg you will excu&s;e me, and impute it to an odd whim I have, that I don't give you my Rea&s;ons for it. I'll do't for you, &s;aid <HI>Bautrin,</HI> taking up the Que|&s;tion. In Hell it &s;elf, &s;aid he, never was hatch'd &s;o damnable a thing as <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett.</HI> Thereupon the whole Company bur&s;t out into a great laughter, and cry'd he was not an Impartial Judge, having a Mortal peek to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> for making him walk a foot. Think not, Sirs, reply'd he, that what I now &s;ay is out of madne&s;s for loo&s;ing my Coach and Hor|&s;es; I am equally unlucky at all &s;orts of Games, and had I not lo&s;t 'em at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> I had done it
<PB N="94" REF="51">at &s;ome other Game; &s;o that the exception I have to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> is not from what I have &s;uffer'd but tho&s;e general Extravagancies and mi&s;chiefs that attend it. At all other Games one has time to con&s;ider, and by reflecting upon his Lo&s;&s;es and the Con&s;e|quence thereof, to leave off; but in this there is no being go|vern'd by Rea&s;on, or any time to reflect; it runs away with &s;o much quickne&s;s. One fancies to make the <HI>Paroli,</HI> or <HI>Sept et-le-va,</HI> which hapening to win, the &s;ucce&s;s thereof draws him in to venture all he has, or can rap and rend, in hopes of the like good Fortune, till at la&s;t he loo|&s;es all, and runs him&s;elf over head and ears in as &s;hort a time as I've been &s;peaking. There's the Duce, &s;ays another, has lo&s;t
<PB N="95" REF="51">thrice already, 'tis &s;trange if it &s;hou'd loo&s;e the fourth time; &s;o thinking to have found out a &s;ure Card, in full confidence of winning, he &s;ets all he has left upon it, which is fa&s;s'd, or loo|&s;es the <HI>Sonica.</HI> Then how he &s;torms, and rages, and borrow|ing all the Money he can of every body, to follow the Duce on, he loo&s;es it (if he wou'd confe&s;s) four times the deal fol|lowing.</P>
<P>Next day, without fail, he mu&s;t &s;eek out for Money to pay what he borrowed the Night before, and wherewithal to have his Revenge. Then the Cloaths, Jewels, and what ever Move|ables he has, go to pawn, and &s;o he has it, he cares not what Procuration or Intere&s;t he gives. With what fear, and concern, with
<PB N="96" REF="52">what impatience, and palpitati|on of the Heart, does he watch the Cards as the Dealer is draw|ing 'em, e&s;pecially if he &s;ees the corner of a Card which looks like his: Nay, I'll main|tain <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> does tire and wa&s;t the Spirits of tho&s;e who play deep, more then any other Game, even <HI>Tennis</HI> it &s;elf; for which Rea&s;ons the Phy&s;icians do &s;trictly forbid it to all tho&s;e who are inclined to Con&s;umpti|ons. I have &s;een Women na|turally of a pale Complexion, redden like Fire, and Men in the mid&s;t of the harde&s;t Fro&s;ts &s;wet as though they were in a Bagnio. <HI>Avalon,</HI> whom ye all know, in the height of his Fea|ver, &s;aid, <HI>Va ten Pi&s;tols,</HI> a Mi|nute after the <HI>Pay,</HI> then the double <HI>Pay,</HI> a <HI>Paroli</HI> of the
<PB N="97" REF="52">whole, continued he, in a great Agony, and on a &s;udden, rai&s;ing his Voice, cry'd out, like one in De&s;pair, Oh! unfortunate Crea|ture that I am! to loo&s;e the <HI>So|nica;</HI> in&s;omuch that 'twas fear'd lea&s;t tho&s;e light-headed Fits &s;hou'd turn to a perfect Fren|zie; and but for his able Phy&s;i|cian Dr. <HI>Pyard,</HI> who (knowing he had lo&s;t much at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI>) advis'd him to &s;end for &s;ome Game&s;ters to play by his Bed &s;ide, who came and lo&s;t to him &s;ome Money, which to that purpo&s;e his Mother had given 'em, the unfortunate Youth might have &s;pent the re&s;t of his Days in Bedlam.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the lea&s;t of tho&s;e many Evils that <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> is the cau&s;e of. Young Gentlemen de|&s;ign'd for the Clergy, or the
<PB N="98" REF="53">Law, who, till <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> came in, never knew what Gameing was, now lay a&s;ide the thoughts of their other Studies, and apply them&s;elves wholly to the finding out &s;ome little Tricks and Ad|vantages of the Game, or how to take up Money at a Scrive|ners; who upon mighty advan|tages &s;upplies 'em with great &s;umms. The Merchants, Perry|wig makers, Taylors, Hatters, Mercers, or Lace-men, can't get a Farthing of Money from a <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI>-player; his Pur&s;e is intire|ly devoted to the Bank, and to be put to no other u&s;e. Upon the whole mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ter, there are none but the U&s;urers, and Pawn|brokers, but what loo&s;e by't. Let a Woman be never &s;o di&s;|creet, or virtuous, if &s;he has once ta&s;ted of the powerful
<PB N="99" REF="53">Charms of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> &s;he can ne|ver wean her &s;elf from it: if &s;he wants Money, &s;he mu&s;t have it one way of other, and when &s;he has no other Remedy, &s;he borrows it of her Lover, who, after that, is &s;o far from finding her Cruel, that &s;he will gratifie him with many Favours, which &s;he won't vouch&s;afe to the poor Man her Husband. That 'tis a certain Gain to tho&s;e who keep the Bank, &s;aid the <HI>Abb&egrave; Olarion,</HI> is apparent from their having always won. Fie! re|ply'd <HI>Bautrain,</HI> I never dealt in my Life, but I lo&s;t: and there was a Lady of <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> one of my particular Acquaintance, who in three Weeks time, by dealing at Six-penny <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> lo&s;t Three thou&s;and <HI>Livers</HI> clear. You
<PB N="100" REF="54">&s;hall have a Man, when he has been &s;tuck at play, come to a &s;mall Bank, and &s;et a Hundred or Six&s;core <HI>Lo&uuml;is d'ors</HI> upon a Card. The Bank upon a Pun|ctillio of Honour &s;tands it, the Setter winning it, makes the <HI>Paroli,</HI> and wins that too, &s;o breaks the Bank, and at one Bout wins the whole Profit of three Month. 'Twas &s;o that Madam <HI>Fontaigners</HI> Bank was broke.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Council is wi&s;e, and had not forbid <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> but for the great Di&s;orders it occa&s;ion'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> and for our common Good. They have the power in their Hands, and mu&s;t not be di&s;obey'd; the fatal Con|&s;equences whereof, are in my Opinion too dangerous to be ventur'd. Scarce had <HI>Bautrain</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="54">&s;peaking, when <HI>&V;li&s;&s;on</HI> ta|king up the Que&s;tion, 'Tis ob|&s;ervable, Sirs, &s;aid he, that the mo&s;t refined things in Morality, and the be&s;t in Nature, do, when u&s;ed with exce&s;s, prove the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous. No Game that ever yet was in|vented is comparable to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> if play'd at with moderation and temper, nor any &s;o pernici|ous when us'd to exce&s;s. The de&s;ign of Gaming, is to amuze the Mind with the various and extraordinary changes of For|tune, ju&s;t as <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> does: for a Proof thereof you need but call to mind what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bautrain</HI> &s;aid. A Setter, &s;aid he, looks upon him&s;elf to be upon the Point of being made a Beggar, his luck changes, a <HI>Sept-et-le-va</HI> comes and makes
<PB N="102" REF="55">him a Prince. Can any thing be more &s;urprizing? Can any thing be more tran&s;porting? Have you occa&s;ion for Ten or Twelve Pi&s;tols to throw away upon any Diverti&s;ement, go to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> Table, and as &s;oon as ever you have won 'em, take your own time to come away; no body will pre&s;s you to play on&punc; no body will call after you, and you may go off with 'em without being counted a clo&s;e &s;harping Game&s;ter; a freedom that is the peculiar Excellency of this Game, and not allow'd of in any other. When at any time any of us are ill treated by our cruel Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, we take advan|tage of the Extremities to which <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> reduces 'em, to &s;ubdue 'em to our Affections: Is not this a great relief to a wretched
<PB N="103" REF="55">Lover, who has &s;pent Days and Nights in Sighs and Prayers, without obtaining the lea&s;t Fa|vour? <HI>Hazard, Quinque-nove,</HI> or <HI>Lan&s;quenet,</HI> may produce as bad Effects, and are as quick de&s;pe|rate Games as <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett;</HI> be&s;ides, a <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> player has great advan|tage over all other Game&s;ters, he goes boldly into the Compa|ny of Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Qua|lity, and is well lookt upon: If he tallie&egrave;s, he is much made of, and all the Servants of the Hou&s;e are particularly ob&s;ervant to him. 'Tis true, there is an Order to forbid it, the be&s;t way there|fore is to addre&s;s to the King, and repre&s;ent to him that <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> does not &s;o much hurt at <HI>Paris,</HI> as his Maje&s;ty is inform'd, and &s;o make an intere&s;t to have leave to keep a Bank: for my
<PB N="104" REF="56">part I'll make one willingly, and allow 80000 <HI>Livres</HI> yearly towards it for my own &s;hare. This, Gentlemen, is my Opi|nion. <HI>&V;li&s;&s;on</HI> having made an end, the Chevalier underta|king to &s;peak to't, &s;aid, This appears to me, Sirs, to be a matter of great difficulty; for, that 'tis of mighty advantage to keep the Bank at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett,</HI> is &s;o undeniable a Truth, that 'twere needle&s;s to u&s;e any Arguments to prove how prejudical this Or|der to forbid <HI>Ba&s;&s;ett</HI> has been to us &s;worn Keepers of the Bank. The Point now to be con&s;ider'd of is, how we may continue to play at it without running into any danger; a matter of &s;o great difficulty, that the more and more I think on't, the further
<PB N="105" REF="56">I am from finding out which way it may be done: There is no plea&s;ure I'm &s;ure in being made an Example: to play pri|vately and in a Room that is lock'd up, won't turn to account, or &s;o much as pay for the Cards and Candles: on the other hand 'tis too hazardous to play in Noblemen's or Amba&s;&s;adors Hou&s;es, as they did at <HI>Hoca,</HI> lea&s;t an Officer &s;hou'd come <HI>in|cognito,</HI> and under pretence of playing, &s;erve us, to our great comfort, with a Verbal Proce&s;s for di&s;obeying the Order. And how many poor indigent Fellows are there, who in hopes of ha|ving the Fine, will turn Infor|mers.
