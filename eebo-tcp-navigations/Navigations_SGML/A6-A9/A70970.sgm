<HEAD>The Second Part OF THE REMARKS on the NAVY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for &s;ending me the Ob&s;ervations upon the fir&s;t part of my Remarks on the Navy, be|cau&s;e it came while I was writing &s;omething upon the Di&s;cipline of the Navy; &s;o that at the &s;ame time I have an opportunity to correct the In&s;olence of that in&s;ignificant Scribler. I can a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I am as well acquainted with the Gentleman he &s;canda|lizes, as the Author him&s;elf is with the Secretary of the Admiralty; and tho I much prefer Argument before Reviling, I mu&s;t &s;pare a few Paragraphs in vindicati|on of one that bears a better Character in the world than this trifling Ob&s;ervator can pretend to. This Author &s;ays, that what he has &s;ent into the World, is the Effect of <HI>Ale</HI> and <HI>Brandy:</HI> Now I know that Gentleman never drinks one of tho&s;e Liquors, and very &s;eldom of the other; &s;o that beginning his Book with a <HI>Lye,</HI> you have little rea&s;on to believe him after|wards. There was, Sir, in our Time, one Captain <HI>Fudge</HI> Commander of a Merchant-man, who upon his
<PB N="2" REF="3">Return from a Voyage, how ill fraught &s;oever his Ship was, always brought home his Owners a good Cargo of <HI>Lies,</HI> in&s;omuch that now aboard Ship the Sailors, when they hear a great <HI>Lye</HI> told, cry out, <HI>you fudge it.</HI> Now, Sir, I mu&s;t give you to under&s;tand that this memorable Captain <HI>Fudge</HI> got diver&s;e and &s;undry Sons, &s;ome for the Admiralty, &s;ome for the Navy, and &s;ome for Merchants Service; and this Author's Talent of <HI>Lying</HI> coming up to the Standard of the Sire, we can believe him to be no other than young <HI>Fudge</HI> of the Admiralty, and by his Multiplication of Lyes, may be admitted to Seniority, and take place as elder Brother.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fudge</HI> tells you, <HI>page</HI> 4. that the Party he &s;candalizes turned his back upon an Office wherein he was employ'd; but if he were re&s;tored to the Bread and Chee&s;e he is fallen from, he dares an&s;wer for it that his Mouth would be &s;topt, and never open'd a|gain on the like Subject: and this place, he &s;ays, <HI>pag.</HI> 6. was Clerk of the Cutting-hou&s;e at 40 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> Do but mark the rea&s;on of the empty Creature; A Place of 40 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> did not &s;top his Mouth, and therefore the &s;ame place of 40 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> will &s;top his Mouth. Such con&s;equences as the&s;e, are the natural Product of the Brains employ'd in the Navy; where a wonder|ful Stupidity, join'd with a good &s;tock of Impudence, never fails of Preferment. But I can a&s;&s;ure him that Gentleman is &s;o far from de&s;iring &s;uch an Employ, or &s;candalizing him&s;elf by &s;erving the Navy under &s;uch an Admini&s;tration, that he would not tell tho&s;e men his name for &s;uch an Office.</P>
<P>He tells us in the &s;ame Page, that he has <HI>a de&s;erved Poverty.</HI> Now it is no Crime nor Sin to be poor. But it is very hard for a man to be cheated of his
<PB N="3" REF="3">Right, and then reflected upon for his Poverty. His Po|verty indeed is de&s;erved on the account of his Services to this Government and his Country: Young <HI>Fudge</HI> is in the right on't here; for great care has been taken to keep tho&s;e down, that ro&s;e mo&s;t early in the Ser|vice of their Country. The&s;e Reflections are but &s;o many Arrows &s;hot at them&s;elves; for there was never a man in that Office to which this Gentleman belong'd be&s;ides him&s;elf, that ever ventur'd a Hair of his Head in the Service of his Country; yet at the &s;ame time, a parcel of poor in&s;ignificant Mortals, as fooli&s;h as for|tunate, enjoy'd places of 400 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> in that Office. Now the rea&s;on why this Gentleman took this mean Employ in that Office, was upon the account of an Uncle of his, then a Commi&s;&s;ioner there, who brought him into that, in pro&s;pect of another much better, likely then to be vacant; for which he had the pro|mi&s;e of a certain Per&s;on, who deals &s;o much in Re|ligion, that he cannot afford us any of his Morals, or &s;o much as once be true to his word.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervator <HI>fudges</HI> on, and tells you <HI>p.</HI> 5. That this Gentleman &s;ome years ago could not prove his Allegations before a Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons. How he came to have more &s;en&s;e than the whole Hou&s;e of Commons, I can't tell: for up|on the report of that Affair to the Hou&s;e, they were not of &s;uch an Opinion. He tells you in the &s;ame Page, that he is Poet Laureat to the <HI>Calves-head Club:</HI> but if young <HI>Fudge</HI> were to be hang'd, or make good this A&s;&s;ertion, he would be in a fine Condition. In <HI>p.</HI> 6. he magnifies his Knowledg, by acquainting the world he has &s;erved two Apprentice&s;hips in the Naval School of <HI>England.</HI> I have known one that &s;erved two Apprentice&s;hips in a Univer&s;ity, and yet as great a
<PB N="4" REF="4">Fool as if he had never been there. He tells you a|bundance of Stories of his good Services, of his Ho|ne&s;ty, <HI>&amp;c. p.</HI> 7. which we may believe to be e'en as true as what went before; for if it be true, he is a Non&s;uch. He would make us believe, that he has not enrich'd him&s;elf by his Employment, and that he gets not one 4th part of what his Predece&s;&s;ors got be|fore him. One Rea&s;on of this may be an Order put up in their Office, that no Officers thereunto belong|ing &s;hould take any Bribes or Rewards; and I could wi&s;h another Article had been tack'd to that Order, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould receive no Pre|&s;ents of Prize Wines from the Commanders.</P>
<P>Page 7th he &s;ays that he holds his Accu&s;er in the <HI>greate&s;t Contempt.</HI> Not &s;o fa&s;t good <HI>Fudge:</HI> the Ac|cu&s;er you pretend, is a Gentleman born and bred; but you have skip'd to a high pitch of In&s;olence, &s;ince you were <HI>Pip</HI>'s Footboy, and your good Lady Mother kept an Apple-&s;tall in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> with a little Net over it, le&s;t &s;ome unlucky Boy &s;hould rob her of a Penny-worth of Apples and a halfpennyworth of Ginger-bread, and &s;o break her at once. Tho you are skip'd up to Preferment, you mu&s;t not undervalue men of Birth and Education, e&s;pecially one that has forgot more Learning than ever you were capable of remem|bring.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 8. he tells you that this Per&s;on did &s;ometime &s;ince by Letter acquaint the Lords of the Admiralty with &s;everal Abu&s;es in the Navy, but e&s;pecially in the managing of the Victualling: their <HI>Lord&s;hips</HI> did thereupon &s;ignifie their de&s;ire to &s;peak with him; but when he attended them, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying, That he had formerly laid tho&s;e Matters before other Per&s;ons without Succe&s;s, and had little hopes of
<PB N="5" REF="4">faring better from them. Now here is young <HI>Fudg</HI> again. For the Gentleman tells me that he never writ a Line to the Lords, before their Lord&s;hips &s;ent a Let|ter to him, requiring him to attend them. He came to the Office according to their Lord&s;hips Order, and enquiring of the Doorkeeper whether their Lord&s;hips were &s;itting, the Door-keeper gave him a &s;urly an&s;wer, and &s;lap'd to the Door; however he knock'd again, when Mr. Door-keeper looking out, &s;aluted him with a <HI>what does the Fellow want?</HI> At which the Gentleman gave him &s;ome hard Language, and told him their Lord&s;hips had &s;ent for him; but if they had nothing to &s;ay to him, he had nothing to &s;ay to them. Soon after this he was admitted to their Lord&s;hips, who indeed received him with a Civility an&s;werable to their Characters, and gave him all the Rea&s;on in the World to imagine they were real in their Intentions to redre&s;s tho&s;e Grievances they were willing to be ac|quainted with. But the Secretary acquainted their Lord&s;hips, that this Gentleman had printed a &s;canda|lous Libel, reflecting upon the late Commi&s;&s;ioners, which was confirmed to their Lord&s;hips by another Scribe there, tho, I believe, neither of them &s;aw that Gentleman's face before that time; which, together with &s;ome other &s;curvy Reflections, without any Re|primand from the Board, was di&s;couragement enough for him not to lay any thing before them.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <HI>pag.</HI> 11. That this Gentleman, when the Board called before them the Commi&s;&s;ioners for Victu|alling, upon a Complaint of Mr. <HI>Kelly,</HI> did not &s;o far &s;hew his Zeal to the Publick, as to appear face to face with tho&s;e Gentlemen. Truly 'tis no wonder he did not appear, when he knew nothing of the Bu&s;ine&s;s: Did their Lord&s;hips give him any notice? or did they
<PB N="6" REF="5">order him to attend at that time? He prints a Letter from Mr. <HI>Burchett,</HI> pag. 10. to the Author of the Re|marks, which he &s;ays may &s;ufficiently te&s;tify he had an Opportunity offered him to bring to light what he knew upon Mr. <HI>Kelly</HI>'s hearing. Well &s;aid young <HI>Fudge.</HI> The Letter to the Author is dated <HI>September</HI> 11. and Mr. <HI>Kelly</HI>'s hearing was the 6th of the &s;ame Month, five days before. This is Admiralty Rea&s;on all over. He &s;ays, at that time the Management of the Victualling was &s;olemnly examined into, when Mr. <HI>Kelly</HI> &s;um|moned about 50 Witne&s;&s;es, and but about a fifth part of them were called in and examined; this was a &s;o|lemn Hearing indeed. 'Tis true, he was no &s;tranger to Mr. <HI>Kelly</HI>'s Complaint, but encourag'd him to lay it before that Board, in order to judg by their Manage|ment of a piece, what they would do with the whole.</P>
<P>Upon this Hearing Captain <HI>Boult,</HI> the Purveyor for Corn, a Gentleman that knows more of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Victualling than all the re&s;t concerned therein, was di&s;charg'd from his Employment by their Lord|&s;hips. I know not the Merits of Captain <HI>Boult</HI>'s Di&s;|charge, but am fully a&s;&s;ured that Mi&s;management lay at the door of another Per&s;on. However this Gentle|man hearing it buzz'd about the Victualling Office, that Capt. <HI>Boult</HI> was di&s;charged for accu&s;ing one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and knowing it to be the con&s;tant practice of the Victuallers to di&s;charge all &s;uch as made Complaints, thought it would be in vain to bring any more Per&s;ons before their Lord&s;hips to te&s;tify any thing again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners, they being a&s;&s;ur'd of a di&s;charge by one Board or the other. But this Gentle|man being unwilling to believe a thing upon a bare Re|port or Surmi&s;e, went up to the Lords to know of them whether Captain <HI>Boult</HI> was di&s;charged upon the
<PB N="7" REF="5">&s;aid Account or no: But there being not a full Board, their Lord&s;hips declined giving him any an&s;wer to his Que&s;tion. And this is the true Account of the mat|ter, however <HI>Fudg</HI> with his <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> Rhetorick has been pleas'd to mi&s;repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>Our empty-brain'd Author in the &s;ame Page, reflects on my Folly, in being concerned that the Lords of the Admiralty, upon receiving a Letter &s;igned <HI>A. B.</HI> offering to make Di&s;coveries, do cau&s;e to be in&s;erted in the Ga|zet the &s;ubject Matter of <HI>A. B</HI>'s Letter; and would be gladly informed, if two Letters &s;hould come at the &s;ame time, &s;igned <HI>A. B.</HI> to the very &s;ame purpo&s;e, and with the &s;ame Date, how he could &s;atisfy either the one or the other <HI>A. B.</HI> their re&s;pective Letters were received, without hinting &s;omething of the Contents of them. Certainly this cannot puzzle the boa&s;ted Wi&s;dom of the Admiralty. If both Letters are &s;igned <HI>A. B.</HI> and both of them contain the &s;ame matter; if one of the <HI>A. B</HI>'s appear, it may be &s;ufficient. And if after one <HI>A. B.</HI> has appear'd, if they are de&s;irous to hear what the other <HI>A. B.</HI> can &s;ay, 'tis but Gazetting again, and they'l be acquainted with both: or other|wi&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e their Lord&s;hips in one Adverti&s;ement &s;hould require both the <HI>A. B</HI>'s to appear, mayn't this be done without telling the &s;ubject matter of their Letters, which are both to the &s;ame purport?</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable this Admiralty Officer, always in his Scribble, loads Complainers with the infamous name of <HI>Informers.</HI> Is this Character the mighty Encourage|ment they give to Complainers? 'Tis well they han't all their Throats cut, as one lately had at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> upon &s;uch an Account; for tho&s;e who have &s;erv'd their Country after this manner, have for the generality met with &s;uch Treatment, or the recompen&s;e of &s;tarving
<PB N="8" REF="6">or lo&s;ing their Employments. It's a hard Ca&s;e that &s;uch as complain of Grievances, &s;hould undergo the &s;candal of Informers, when &s;uch as informed again&s;t Conventicles in the late Reigns, meet with &s;uch Encou|ragement in this, as a Journeyman Apothecary, a common Informer and Per&s;ecutor, was made Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of the Victualling. I could mention many more &s;uch that have got good Employments, when &s;uch as complain of Grievances get only the abu&s;ive title of Informers from our Admiralty folk.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fudge</HI> &s;ays, <HI>page</HI> 12. of his Railery, That I am angry that the Fleet was not &s;ent from the <HI>Downs</HI> before the 15th of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, in order to prevent a &s;up|po&s;ed Inva&s;ion. <HI>And indeed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I cannot wonder at his having &s;o deep a &s;en&s;e of an Inva&s;ion, &s;ince (if I am not very much mi&s;inform'd) his &s;hewing an early good will to an Attempt of that kind in the late Reign, procu|red him &s;uch Treatment as will always &s;tick in his Stomach; and perhaps his meaning is, That then he ventur'd his Life for the pre&s;ervation of his Country:</HI> and that you may know what Inva&s;ion he means, he tells you in the Mar|gin 'twas the Duke of <HI>Monmouths.</HI> I could tell you a pretty Story, were it convenient, concerning the Me|thods of de&s;troying that unfortunate Duke; but as for the Inva&s;ion I know nothing of it: when a People are robb'd of their Liberty, and are brought into perfect Slavery, they may come to the recovery of their Rights either by Land or by Water. And it is ju&s;tifiable in any Per&s;on, tho never &s;o ob&s;cure, to head an armed Com|pany in defence of their Rights, much more a Per&s;on of that Duke's Quality, however unfortunate. That our Rights were then Invaded is beyond di&s;pute, when at that very time the late King was collecting the Cu&s;|toms and Exci&s;e without Act of Parliament. I make
<PB N="9" REF="6">no que&s;tion but this Admiralty Tool, who in this Reign calls the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Di&s;embarkment an Inva&s;ion, will in the next &s;ay as much of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s De&s;cent; for I dare engage, like the Vicar of <HI>Bray,</HI> he'l hold in under all Governments, if fawn|ing, &s;neaking, and lying will effect it. But prithee <HI>Fudg,</HI> according to the Doctrines of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, the avowed Principles of thy Par|ty; how can'&s;t thou hold an Office under a Govern|ment built upon the Ruins of tho&s;e Doctrines? but thy Con&s;cience is a State Weather-cock, turned about by the wind of any Revolution. The treatment I met with in the late Reigns was indeed &s;evere enough, and none but an ill-bred Skipkennel would reflect upon a Man for his Misfortunes, which he has undergone with &s;o much Reputation and Credit; nor are my Hard&s;hips under this Government much le&s;s, only with this difference, that I was as early to bring this King in as I was to drive the other out: nor am I alone in the&s;e Misfortunes, there are many be&s;ide my &s;elf that are di&s;couraged by this Government, when many are en|abled to buy them&s;elves into Offices with the Money they got for Pardons of the D. of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s followers: and if the Recovery of our Rights be not ju&s;tifiable, I &s;hall with this Author conclude, that I did not then venture my Life for the pre&s;ervation of my Country.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 13. concerning the Fleet's lying in the <HI>Downs</HI> till <HI>July,</HI> he &s;ays,
<Q REND="margDblQuotes">He cannot fore&s;ee that they might not have been as ready from thence as any other place to prevent an Inva&s;ion: For, &s;uppo&s;ing a Neighbour of ours had put to Sea with any &s;uch De|&s;ign, and with a greater Strength, and that our Ships by being far We&s;tward had been cut off from Succour, I would gladly know whether we had not
<PB N="10" REF="7">then been in a hopeful Condition to defend our Country? For in &s;uch a Ca&s;e it would have been next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to have &s;ent an additional Strength to their Relief, a greater Force being be|tween them and &s;uch Succour; &s;o might they upon any Alarm, when in the <HI>Downs,</HI> either have gone from thence, and attack'd the Enemy with the Strength they had, or have continued there &s;ome time till more Ships could have joyn'd them from the River.</Q></P>
<P>I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on why our Ships &s;hould be too far We&s;tward, or &s;o far Ea&s;tward as the <HI>Downs,</HI> unle&s;s we pur&s;ue the old Methods of &s;ending them farthe&s;t out of the way, when they &s;hould do us mo&s;t Service. If a Neighbour of ours had a de&s;ign to invade us, I think it a very improper Station to prevent it, to ride with our Ships at one end of his Country; when I &s;tand in the middle of a Thing, I can &s;ee more of that Thing than if I &s;tood at either end. Now in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Admiralty Politicks, I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Downs</HI> the wor&s;t Station for our Shipping to ob&s;truct an Inva&s;ion; in the fir&s;t place it is a great way off any of the Enemies Ports, where their Ships of War are laid up; and then the Winds hanging We&s;terly for at lea&s;t two thirds of the Year, the Enemy have an Opportunity of in|vading us when our Ships are Windbound; and they have all the Coa&s;t of <HI>England</HI> clear from the <HI>Downs</HI> to the <HI>Lands-end.</HI> I &s;hould rather imagine St. <HI>Helens, Spithead,</HI> and <HI>Stokes-Bay,</HI> a proper Station for our Ships at &s;uch a juncture. If we are not &s;trong enough in &s;hipping, they are more readily &s;upplied with an addi|tional force from <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> from whence they may be join'd in a few Hours. When our Author &s;ays, in the <HI>Downs</HI> they may be join'd from the River in a little
<PB N="11" REF="7">time, he &s;ays he knows not what; &s;uppo&s;e the Winds are contrary, it blows a Storm, or our great Ships are be|neapt. It's true, there are not &s;o many Ships laid up at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> as in <HI>Chatham</HI> River; but I hope they may be fitting out on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, both at <HI>Chatham</HI> and <HI>Plymouth</HI> at the &s;ame time. We are in no danger from the Ea&s;tward, the Enemy has but few Ports that way, and all that Coa&s;t is a Lee-&s;hoar above half the Year; and all the other Ports of our Enemy being to the We&s;tward of St. <HI>Helens,</HI> if the Wind &s;hould &s;pring up to the Ea&s;tward, and bring any of the Enemies Ships from an Ea&s;tern Port, they cannot join their other Ships without ob&s;truction from our Fleet. But I &s;hall go too far upon this Subject; for young <HI>Fudg,</HI> a little lower in this Page, tells me I am but a fre&s;h Water Sailor, and con&s;equently can have no knowledg in Na|val Affairs: perhaps I have &s;een as much of the Sea as young <HI>Fudg</HI> him&s;elf; I think I &s;aw more of it in the great Storm in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, than ever I &s;hall de&s;ire to &s;ee again: yet &s;uppo&s;e I am no Sailor, but a meer Land|man, why mayn't one Landman talk of Ships Stations, as well as another Landman appoint them?</P>
<P>Now we mu&s;t allow our <HI>Fudg</HI> to &s;ay &s;omething in defence of an Office, in which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o eminent a Po&s;t: he that will lye, will without doubt &s;wear for his Ma&s;ters; he &s;ays the Royal Navy of <HI>England</HI> is not fallen to decay, but on the contrary,
<Q REND="margDblQuotes">That in|&s;tead of &s;uch a Misfortune, our Royal Navy is at this time in a much better Condition than it was at the entrance into the War.</Q> Thank you for nothing, good Sir, after &s;o many Millions &s;pent. I hope the Navy Officers han't embezeled all the Money appoint|ed for that Service; 'tis a hard ca&s;e if we have not more Ships built, and our Dock-Yards fuller of Stores:
<PB N="12" REF="8">but this is not the Que&s;tion, Are our Ships as well Of|ficer'd? are they as well man'd, are they as well paid? have they as good a Di&s;cipline? Yes, he &s;ays,
<Q REND="margDblQuotes">As to the Oeconomy and Di&s;cipline, there is no Man who is a proper Judg thereof, but will readily own very many Embeli&s;hments have been added thereunto by the Care and Pains of tho&s;e worthy Per&s;ons who commanded both at Home and at Sea, &s;ince the afore|&s;aid War commenced.</Q> The Embeli&s;hments added to the Di&s;cipline of the Navy, he in&s;erts in five Rules or Directions, <HI>p.</HI> 17. appointed to be ob&s;erved in order to the returning to their Maje&s;ties Service, &s;uch Men as &s;hall be put on &s;hore &s;ick or hurt, from their Ma|je&s;ties Ships. He tells you nothing how the&s;e Rules and Directions were ob&s;erved, how the Complaints upon breach of the&s;e Directions have been redre&s;&s;ed, not one word of this matter. Now to the&s;e five Rules and Directions of Navy Di&s;cipline, I &s;hall at the end of this Paper add twelve more, which Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> in his Paper pre&s;ents the World, under the name of Grievances; and in the mean time, Sir, &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e &s;omething concerning the Di&s;cipline of the Navy.</P>
<P>The Sailors are the only People of the Engli&s;h Na|tion, that are left to the di&s;cretionary Power of their Commanders, a Power indeed which belongs only to a Being which is always Wi&s;e, and ever Ju&s;t. When Men execute &s;uch a Power, it can be call'd no other|wi&s;e than Arbitrary, for all Men are born to &s;ome Rights, and tho&s;e Rights are &s;ecured to them by &s;ome Laws. Now to take away from them tho&s;e Rights in defiance of tho&s;e Laws, is an action in it &s;elf Ar|bitrary. No Court of Ju&s;tice in <HI>England</HI> can give a Sentence &s;o definitive, that the Defendant &s;hall have no Appeal to any other Court. If I am ca&s;t at Com|mon

I &s;hall here therefore endeavour to &s;how that the Di&s;cipline of our Navy has been directly contrary to our Con&s;titution, and then leave any one to judg of that Di&s;cipline, whether it has not been matter of ju&s;t Complaint, and an abominable Abu&s;e up|on the Sailors.</P>
<P>The 29th Chapter of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> &s;ays, <HI REND="blackletterType">No Free|man &s;hall be taken or Impri&s;oned, or be di&s;&s;eized of his Freehold, or Liberties, or Free Cu&s;toms, or be Out|law'd or Exiled, or any otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed; nor We will not pa&s;s upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful Iudgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.</HI> The&s;e words <HI>per Legem Terrae,</HI> in the end of this Chapter, do refer to all the precedent matter con|tained in it. Now I give any one leave to judg whe|ther the Impre&s;&s;ing Seamen for the Service, be not a violation of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> when Men are <HI>taken</HI> and <HI>impri&s;oned</HI> a Shipboard &s;ix or &s;even Years together. To &s;ay we are a free People when any of us are in effectu|al Slavery, is meer Non&s;en&s;e; for the &s;ame Power that deprives one part of the People of their Liberty, may en&s;lave the whole People. And yet how many Pre&s;s-Warrants have we had granted from the Admiralty to Men that are no Officers? For none are &s;uch, but tho&s;e that are under the Cognizance of the Laws of the Land: Where do our Laws make mention of a Pre&s;s|ma&s;ter? Whom do our Laws commi&s;&s;ionate to con&s;ti|tute
<PB N="14" REF="9">&s;uch Officers? Now when a Freeman is taken and impri&s;oned by an Officer not known to our Laws, &s;uch an Act is a downright Piracy upon the Liberty of the People.</P>
<P>If they object, That without this Di&s;cipline the Ships of War cannot be mann'd for the &s;ecurity of the Realm: if it be Nece&s;&s;ary, make it Legal; we had as good lo&s;e our Country, as lo&s;e our Rights. But how have Navys been &s;upply'd with Men in former Ages? When the Nation's Service was accounted the be&s;t at Sea, and Men made Intere&s;t to get before the Ma&s;t; this proceeded from the good Di&s;cipline of tho&s;e times, the good U&s;age of the Sea|men by their Commanders; they were not then poi|&s;on'd with bad Provi&s;ions, Pea&s;e-Bread, and &s;tinking Beef and Pork; they were not then kept out of their Pay by Q's and R's: Such Men as General <HI>Blake,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sandwich, Dean, Law&s;on, Bourn, Minns,</HI> &amp;c. were familiar with their Sailors, and in&s;tead of calling them damn'd Dogs, or Sons of Whores, call'd 'em Bre|thren. The Abu&s;es of Seamen in this point, during this War, have been very con&s;iderable, but without Redre&s;s, as their other Grievances have; and &s;ome have been commi&s;&s;ionated in this Affair, too big for me to mention, and have received Salaries for this piece of Service, tho I could never hear of any Service they did, &s;ave only a Cu&s;tomer's impre&s;&s;ing a great many Ma&s;ters of Ships at <HI>Brighthelm&s;tone.</HI> They were not only Seamen they pre&s;s'd, but many times Landmen, when the pre&s;s Smacks coming into &s;mall Creeks took &s;uch Men away, and carrying them 40 or 50 Miles from their own homes, have left them to beg their way to their own Country; many thus have had their Limbs &s;tarv'd by lying upon the Balla&s;t, being
<PB N="15" REF="9" MS="y">unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch hard&s;hips; and when any of the Landmen thus pre&s;&s;ed have been di&s;charged, they have paid 12 <HI>d. per</HI> day to the Ma&s;ter of the Smack for Diet, and no doubt but the King paid near as much. Now I perceive the main Rea&s;on of want of men, is our want of good Commanders. Capt. <HI>Jumper,</HI> nor any of tho&s;e Commanders during the War that u&s;ed their men hone&s;tly and civilly, ever wanted their Comple|ment of men: But our Beau Commanders, the Sir <HI>Courtlys</HI> of the Sea, if they were forced to man their Ships upon their own Credit and Reputation among&s;t the Sailors, would not be able to bring them from the River to the <HI>Downs</HI> in a twelve Month. And to keep the&s;e Creatures in Commi&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t it &s;eems make a rent in our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><HI>No man &s;hall be di&s;&s;ei&s;ed,</HI> i. e. put out of <HI>Sei&s;in,</HI> or di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Freehold, <HI>i. e.</HI> Lands or Livelyhood, Liberties or Free Cu&s;toms, which belong to him as his free Birth-right. Now to &s;ay that a Seaman has not as good a Right as any to the Free Cu&s;toms, Franchi&s;es, and Liberties of the Country he is born in, is very ab&s;urd. If a Landman has a liberty to go on Foot, or Hor&s;eback, or by Coach, to follow that Employ whereby he gets his livelyhood; has not a Seaman the &s;ame Right, to &s;ail in what Ship and to what Port he plea&s;es?</P>
<P><HI>No man &s;hall be outlaw'd,</HI> made an <HI>Exlex, i. e.</HI> de|barred of the Benefit of the Law of the Land, unle&s;s it be done according to Law. Now according to the Di&s;cipline of the Navy, are not all our Sailors Out|laws, and deprived of the Benefit of the Law, when they are not their own men, but liable to be taken into Cu&s;tody, and deprived of their Liberty by every rapacious Pre&s;s-ma&s;ter?</P>
<PB N="16" REF="10">
<P><HI>No man &s;hall be exiled,</HI> bani&s;hed from the Place of his Nativity. <HI>Nemo perdet Patriam.</HI> By the Laws of our Land, no man can be bani&s;hed from his Na|tive Country, but upon two Accounts. 1&s;t. Either by the Power or Authority of Parliament; or 2dly. In ca&s;e of Abjuration for Felony by the Common Law. The King him&s;elf cannot &s;end any Subject of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t his Will to &s;erve him out of this Realm, &s;o that he &s;hould be an Exile, and that he &s;hould <HI>perdere Patriam.</HI> But it &s;eems the Officers of the Navy have a greater Power than the King, who can force <HI>Freemen</HI> from their Country, and &s;end them to &s;erve in the mo&s;t remote Regions of the World.</P>
<P><HI>No man &s;hall be de&s;troyed (De&s;truere id e&s;t quod prius &s;tructum &amp; factum fuit, penitus Evertere &amp; De&s;truere)</HI> unle&s;s by a Legal Verdict. By de&s;troying is meant forejudging of Life and Limb, or putting to Torture or Death; every oppre&s;&s;ion again&s;t Law by colour of any u&s;urped Authority, being a kind of De&s;tructi|on. Now to apply this to the Di&s;cipline of the Na|vy. What dee' think of whipping our Seamen at the Gears, and then ba&s;ting their flea'd Backs with as many Canns of Pickle as the Commander by his di&s;cretiona|ry Power plea&s;es to order? Are not our Ships thus be|come meer <HI>Bridewells,</HI> and our Sailors as bad or wor&s;e than Gally Slaves? nay, I have known a Boy of 2 or 3 and twenty years of age la&s;h'd to a Gun and whipt, a puni&s;hment given to the younge&s;t Boys on board Ship. Had our Commanders any Religion, our Seamen might &s;tand in fear of the Inqui&s;ition. If a &s;top be not put to their Barbarous and Inhumane Cruelties, they'l in time borrow the Rack from the <HI>French,</HI> and the Boot and Thumb Screws from the <HI>Scots.</HI> Can you blame the Sailors for running from &s;uch Tortures, and &s;hall they
<PB N="17" REF="10">be puni&s;ht for complaining of their Mi&s;eries. 'Tis this, Sir, that da&s;tardizes and effeminates the noble Spirits of your Seamen: 'Tis this makes them de&s;ert the Service of their Country: 'Tis this peoples Colonys of Pirates abroad: And 'tis this will in time be the Ruin of the mo&s;t Glorious Navy of the Uni|ver&s;e. Nor are Pecuniary Mulcts a le&s;s Crime. How this came to be a part of the Di&s;cipline of the Navy, I can't tell; but when men govern by their Will, and not by Law, we mu&s;t every day expect new pu|ni&s;hments. But if it's rea&s;onable that the Sailors &s;hould be puni&s;ht after this manner, is it not as rea&s;onable that the Mulct &s;hould be an&s;werable to the Crime? If a Sailor be ab&s;ent from his Ship a Week, is not that Week's pay &s;ufficient to be &s;topt for that Week's Crime? The Fines in our Courts of Ju&s;tice are laid according to the Worth of the Criminal, exorbitant Fines having in all Ages been e&s;teemed extrajudicial: no man can be fin'd more than he is capable of paying; and to fine a Per&s;on to the full Value of his E&s;tate, is giving away all a man has been gathering for many Years for one Piccadillo.</P>
<P><HI>By lawful Judgment of his Peers, and by the Law of the Land.</HI> Peers, that is his Equals, men of the &s;ame Rank and Quality with him&s;elf. But the Sailors are not try'd after this manner, the &s;ame Per&s;on is Accu|&s;er, Judg and Jury: they have no Indictment, no Jury empannel'd, no Coun&s;el to plead for them; &s;trip they mu&s;t, and to the Gears; the Cat of nine-Tails, and the Pickle Cann mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed upon the Back, as long as the Whipping-Tom upon the Quarter Deck is pleas'd with the &s;port. 'Tis pity young <HI>Fudge's</HI> dear|ly beloved Friend <HI>Jefferies</HI> is dead; he exercis'd his Talent &s;o well in the late Reign in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> that he
<PB N="18" REF="11">would have made an excellent Navy Officer now. They are to be try'd too by the Law of the Land, <HI>i. e.</HI> by due Proce&s;s of Law, for &s;o the words are ex|pre&s;ly expounded by the Stat. of 37 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. Chap. 8. But in&s;tead of this Trial, they are puni&s;ht by the Law of the Admiralty without any Trial at all. So that the poor Tarrs are a &s;ort of People that have no Right at all to any thing but ill U&s;age and barba|rous unmanly Puni&s;hments; Puni&s;hments that are &s;uperior to Death it &s;elf, becau&s;e ignominious and &s;hameful; <HI>malim mori quam vapulari.</HI> But our Navy Officers, like the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Tyrants, employ their Brains more in contriving new &s;orts of Puni&s;hments, than in finding out good and whole&s;om Laws to maintain a Di&s;cipline in the Navy.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you a &s;hort view of the In|con&s;i&s;tence of the Navy Di&s;cipline with the funda|mental Laws of our Realm; a Di&s;cipline not only contrary to the Laws of our Country, but even to the Laws of Nature, and the practice of the mo&s;t un|civilized part of the world. And upon the whole I mu&s;t conclude, that they being warranted by no Law in the Execution of the&s;e Severities, have a&s;&s;umed to, and ve&s;ted them&s;elves with a Legi&s;lative Power, a Power I &s;hall never own to be lodged any where but in Parliament. But if the People of <HI>England</HI> are &s;o far willing to part with their Con&s;titution, as to &s;uffer the Navy Officers to make Laws penal, 'een let 'em allow the Lords of the Trea&s;ury Power to rai&s;e Mony, and then our Bu&s;ine&s;s is brought into a very narrow Compa&s;s; 'twill be a great ea&s;e to you Members of Parliament, you may retire into the Country, walk over your plea&s;ant Fields, and &s;it under your own Vines; but I can tell you in a &s;hort time who'l eat
<PB N="19" REF="11">your Grapes. Pray, Sir, do but call to mind the days of old, the years of your Forefathers; look into the Chronicles of former Ages: did any of your worthy Progenitors &s;uffer their Rights thus to be invaded by men that are their Servants, and receive their Pay? Have they not left you Copies of your Freedom, &s;ealed with their own blood? What Hazards have they run? what Dangers have they attempted? what Battels have they fought to &s;ecure to Po&s;terity tho&s;e Liberties they valued before their Lives? Are not our Liberties the &s;ame? Has envious Time devoured any part of them? Are they le&s;s amiable becau&s;e they are old? Did they bring Kings to di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hatter Crowns, and humble Tyrannical Princes, who inva|ded their Birth-rights? And will you &s;uffer your Freedoms, your Antient Con&s;titution thus to be rent and torn by men of inferior Quality? Whom your Forefathers would have impeached in the name of the good People of <HI>England,</HI> and made them an&s;wer for a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves a Legi&s;lative Power. If you read an excellent Book lately publi&s;hed, entituled, <HI>A Vindication of Magna Charta,</HI> you'l there &s;ee how valuable tho&s;e Rights were, and what Toil and La|bour our Forefathers underwent to keep them entire, and tran&s;mit them to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in the next place prove, that the Commi&s;&s;io|ners for executing the Office of Lord High Ad|miral of <HI>England</HI> during the War, have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves a Di&s;pen&s;ing Power.</P>
<P>By an Act, <HI>Anno Gulielmi &amp; Mariae</HI> 4 <HI>to, &amp;</HI> 5 <HI>to.</HI> entituled, <HI>An Act for continuing the Acts for prohibit|ing all Trade and Commerce with</HI> France, <HI>and for the Encouragement of Privateers,</HI> p. 505. it is enacted,
<PB N="20" REF="12">
<Q REND="margDblQuotes">That if any Captain or Officer, or any other Per|&s;on by his Command or Direction, or any Seaman, or Souldier, or other Per&s;on &s;erving in their Ma|je&s;tys Navy, or in any Privateer, &s;hall take to him or them&s;elves, or imbezle any Mony, Plate, Goods, Lading or Tackle, or any things upon, or above the Gun Deck, or any other part or place what&s;o|ever, in any Ship taken or &s;eized on for Prize, or retaken from the Enemy, the party offending &s;hall lo&s;e and forfeit the Shares, Proportions and Re|wards to him allowed by this Act. And al&s;o in ca&s;e &s;uch Per&s;on be an Officer, he &s;hall forfeit the Sum of five hundred Pounds; and &s;uch Officer &s;hall be un|capable of any Office or Employment under their Maje&s;tys during the &s;pace of &s;even Years.</Q></P>
<P>Many Commanders of Ships, guilty of embezling Prize Goods, and of running of Wines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contra|ry to Law, have notwith&s;tanding this been either continued or re&s;tored to their Commands. If your Honourable Hou&s;e plea&s;es to &s;end for a Li&s;t of &s;uch Commanders as have been di&s;charged, and after|wards re&s;tored to their Commands, and examine in|to the merits of the Cau&s;e for which they were di&s;|charged, you will find this a manife&s;t Truth. To have the Kings &s;hips become Owlers, is far wor&s;e: as lately a parcel of Wool was &s;eized on board the <HI>I&s;abella</HI> Yacht, that has the &s;tation betwixt <HI>Southampton</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey.</HI> I know not how her Pilot Mr. <HI>Peter de St. Croix</HI> (whom I have known much aver&s;e to things of that nature) was prevailed on to take the Matter upon him&s;elf; But this I know very well, that if your Honourable Hou&s;e would enquire into this &s;ingle thing, it would be of great Advantage. I am &s;ure the Judges took the Ca&s;e right enough, whatever the Opinion
<PB N="21" REF="12">of the Admiralty might be concerning it. If a Mer|chant makes a mi&s;take in entring of Goods, the King's Officers are &s;harp enough upon him; but when Of|ficers them&s;elves, or Commanders of the Navy are guilty of the&s;e Crimes, they have Friends to bring them off, tho contrary to the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, for the&s;e very Practices, for the Di&s;pen&s;|ing with Laws, did we depo&s;e the late King <HI>James:</HI> Upon this Account had this very Government its Be|ing. And &s;hall we &s;uffer Men in Commi&s;&s;ion under the Government, not only to make new Laws, but di&s;|pen&s;e with old ones? Their Power is indeed very great, who can make Laws, inflicting Puni&s;hments upon others, when no Laws are binding upon them|&s;elves. They are &s;elf-holders of the Admiralty, &s;up|ported by an uncontroulable Power, and Soveraign Will. What a mi&s;erable Condition are tho&s;e Men in, that are under the Command of &s;uch who&s;e unlimited Rage always roars, and where Laws are always &s;ilent? This is the Oeconomy of the &s;avage Bea&s;ts of the Earth, and thus our Offices become meer De&s;erts.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next &s;how you how the&s;e makers of new Laws are Repealers of the old, good, and whole&s;om Practices and Cu&s;toms of the Navy. Their <HI>Fudge</HI> tells you of the Embeli&s;hments they have added, but not of the Or|naments they have taken away. It has been the con&s;tant practice of the Admiralty in the days of yore, to prefer Men according to their Merit and Demeanour on Ship|board: the Navy of <HI>England</HI> was in tho&s;e times a School, wherein the young Gentlemen of the Nation were educated and in&s;tructed in the Military Arts of the Sea, and became greatly &s;erviceable to their Coun|try. The&s;e Men being de&s;cended from generous Stocks, valued their Reputation, and &s;corn'd to do any thing

<PB N="22" REF="14">that might blot or &s;tain their Pedigree. The Sailors of the Navy had then better Treatment, abu&s;es being be|neath the Character of Gentlemen: Cruelties and Bar|barities are incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of generous and noble Spirits; Whipping and Pickling was then a Puni&s;hment unknown. Cruelty and Cowardice are things in&s;eparable, and practi&s;ed only by Men of a &s;ervil Education. If a Foot-boy or Page be made a Commander, he remembers the Flaps of the Cook|maids Di&s;hclout, the Ba&s;ting and Caning of his Ma&s;|ter's Steward; and now it comes to his turn to domi|neer, he tyrannizes with a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Fury. Tho&s;e Gen|tlemen that were Reformades, or King's Letter-men, were &s;ure of being Lieutenants in former times, and as &s;ure of being Captains in their turn; no Foot-boys or Pages then skip'd over their Heads. But now you may find Lieutenants of many Years &s;tanding in the Navy, while Ma&s;ters of Merchant-men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are made Commanders of 3d Rates, a Po&s;t in former Ages not beneath the Dignity of Noblemen; as for in&s;tance, the Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> in the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Mulgrave</HI> in the <HI>Royal Katherine.</HI> Our Ships were then throng'd with Noblemen, their Sons, and the Sons of our Gentry. But how many of Quality have &s;erved in the Fleet during this War? And is not the lo&s;s of Di&s;ci|pline the apparent Cau&s;e thereof? For 'tis contrary to the very being of generous Spirits to &s;erve under the Command of the Riffraff of their Country, and to do Homage to Men of more inferior Qualities than their Servants. And what encouragement is thus given to tho&s;e Gentlemen that have &s;erved a long time in the Navy as Lieutenants or otherwi&s;e, when tho&s;e that never &s;erved the King one hour are preferred over their Heads? It is farther ob&s;ervable, that the Ma&s;ters of
<PB N="23" REF="14" MS="y">&s;uch Merchant-&s;hips as have been hired into the Ser|vice during the War, by the Intere&s;t of the Owners, have been made Commanders of them, to the Di&s;cou|ragement of &s;uch as have &s;erved in the Navy: &s;uch Commanders in an Engagement were more likely to &s;ave the Merchant&s;hips from blows than hazard them in the King's Service. But for all this they boa&s;t of the Di&s;cipline of the Navy, as a thing excelling that of former Ages, in defiance to publick Opinion, and the Re&s;ults of the mature Debates of the Wi&s;dom of the Nation. Yet upon this Account have the Enemies of the Government no occa&s;ion to reflect upon it, no more than the Husbandman is to be blamed for the nu|merous quantities of Weeds that &s;pring up among his Wheat. The King never gave his Commi&s;&s;ion to the Officers of the Navy to oppre&s;s his Subjects, to &s;ilence old Laws, and enact new Ones. And 'tis much to be feared, methods are taken to prevent the Complaints and Cries of the Subject from reaching his Maje&s;ties Ears; otherwi&s;e we cannot imagine a Prince that has experienced &s;o much of their tender Affection, of their Bravery in War, and the generous Supplies they have given him to pre&s;erve his Per&s;on and Government, would &s;uffer them to langui&s;h under &s;uch intolerable and illegal Evils. If they had Commi&s;&s;ions granted upon &s;uch an Account, we &s;hould know whereabouts we are. Yet tho &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions, being out of the Verge of the Executive Power, are to be accounted for, the Per&s;ons executing them are not excu&s;able, however it fared with the Mini&s;ters of the late King <HI>James.</HI> But we have no room for Imaginations of this kind un|der this Government. And I may farther add, that were his Maje&s;ty truly &s;en&s;ible of the Condition of his Sailors, he would not &s;uffer &s;uch Abu&s;es upon them;
<PB N="24" REF="15">he would not withhold from them their Wages, upon the Account of pretended and illegal Forfeitures: his wonted and manife&s;t Clemency mu&s;t create in us bet|ter Thoughts, than that he who has pardon'd A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, &s;uch as have con&s;pired to take away his Life, that has ea&s;ed <HI>Newgate</HI> &s;o often of its burden of Criminals of all &s;orts, by Acts of Grace and Free Pardons, will &s;uffer his Sailors to lo&s;e their Pay, and &s;tarve for inno|cent Crimes, without extending his Mercy towards them.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, having given you a true account of the nature of our Naval Di&s;cipline, I &s;hall &s;pend a little more time in con&s;idering what young <HI>Fudge,</HI> the Ad|miralty Author, has to &s;ay for his Ma&s;ters. <HI>P.</HI> 21. he &s;ays,
<Q REND="margDblQuotes">Care has been always taken to do Ju&s;tice to the Sailors; for when any one produced rea&s;onable Te&s;|timonials that he did not de&s;ignedly de&s;ert the Ser|vice, but after Recovery endeavoured to return to his proper Ship, if in the way, or entred him&s;elf in any other Ship or Ve&s;&s;el within reach, or that he was Impre&s;&s;ed when endeavouring &s;o to do, the Q has been taken off, and he re&s;tored to his Pay.</Q> Now the que&s;tion is, what tho&s;e rea&s;onable Te&s;timonials are; a few Guineas to young <HI>Fudge,</HI> I believe as good a Te&s;ti|monial as can be.

<Q REND="margDblQuotes">That the Seamen have been much wanting to them&s;elves and Families, as to forfeit their Pay by turning their Back upon their Duty.</Q> When Men have been five or &s;ix Years in the Service without one penny of Wages, can you blame them?

Are not his Wages as recoverable by Law, as they were before he de&s;erted? 'Tis much to be feared that Men are thus kept out of their Pay, on purpo&s;e to make them de&s;ert the Ser|vice; for the Money for their Service is without doubt brought into the Pay Office, and the longer it lies there, the better it is for the Ca&s;hiers: The very Intere&s;t thereof comes to &s;omething; they may lend it the Government at 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> I rather think the Sailors are more wanting to them&s;elves and Familys, by entering into the Service, than by leaving it: For in a Merchant-man they might meet with good U&s;age and good Pay.

The&s;e Men do not run away from their Pay, but they run away becau&s;e they are not paid; but young <HI>Fudg</HI> is like the Fellow that beat his Dog till he &s;tank, and then beat him for &s;tinking.</P>
<P>Now our Naval Politicks are quite &s;pent, the whole Store of Admiralty &s;en&s;e and railery is at an end: for <HI>Fudg</HI> repeats in <HI>pag.</HI> 23. the very &s;ame dull &s;tuff that preceded in <HI>page</HI> 22. And upon the whole, Sir, have you not here a very fine Account of the Management of your Navy? This is an entire Sy&s;tem of our Naval Politicks, written no doubt <HI>permi&s;&s;u &amp; emendationibus Superiorum.</HI> If we are to be invaded, you &s;ee our Ships Stations at that time mu&s;t be in the <HI>Downs;</HI> this is but a &s;ample of their wonderful Sagacity, and what we mu&s;t expect from their Conduct. And as for their Naval Di&s;cipline, I hope I have &s;et you right in that Point; for tho I mu&s;t needs acknowledg a Di&s;cipline in the Navy to be very nece&s;&s;ary, yet there's differ|ence betwixt &s;taring and &s;tark mad. Men ought to be kept to their Duty, but not by &s;uch &s;evere and in|humane Methods as &s;hall frighten them from the Ser|vice. By &s;uch a Di&s;cipline we &s;hall have no Men to exerci&s;e our Di&s;cipline upon, but &s;hall act like the wi&s;e Commander, who &s;unk his Ship to drown the Rats. By &s;uch a Di&s;cipline we &s;hall not only bring upon us the Cur&s;es of the Sailors, but the Cur&s;es of God Almighty, who hears the Cries of the Oppre&s;&s;ed, and puni&s;hes King|doms for &s;uch acts of Violence. The&s;e Men that impo&s;e &s;uch &s;trict Di&s;cipline on others, have none among them|&s;elves. If their Attendance at their re&s;pective Offices were enquired into, you will find as much rea&s;on to prick them Run, as the poor Sailors. Some of them can be ab&s;ent three or four Months together, and yet
<PB N="27" REF="16">receive their Pay without any Q or R. We are not, you know, Sir, in Debt, and therefore can allow one of the Victuallers to look after his Oxen in the Coun|try at Summer, to &s;ell them a good pennyworth to the King at Winter. Bring but our Sailors upon the &s;ame foot with the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, and Victualling; let their Ships be double mann'd, as tho&s;e Offices are double Commi&s;&s;ioner'd, that one half may do Duty while the t'other half is ab&s;ent, and we'll no more complain of Q's and R's.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, Sir, I have not mi&s;pent my Time, if the&s;e few Pages prove any ways &s;erviceable to the common good of my Country: Tho indeed I &s;hould have taken no notice of my trifling railing Ob&s;ervator, had I not be|fore re&s;olved to publi&s;h my Thoughts on the Di&s;cipline of the Navy. How con&s;iderable &s;oever he may think him&s;elf, becau&s;e he occupies an immerited Office un|der the Government, he thinks him&s;elf unan&s;werable, as you may &s;ee in the very fir&s;t Paragraph of his Book, with which I &s;hall conclude; &s;ays he,
<Q REND="margDblQuotes">It might have been rea&s;onably believed, that the Author of a late Pamphlet, relating to Mi&s;managements in the Na|vy, would have left of Scribling, &s;ince the An&s;wer to his la&s;t Year's Politicks left him &s;o little Re|putation.</Q> Now you mu&s;t know, Sir, that young <HI>Fudg</HI> la&s;t Year printed an An&s;wer to my <HI>State of the Navy:</HI> It contain'd about as much &s;tuff as a halfpenny Ballad, tho not half &s;o much &s;en&s;e. But becau&s;e no body took any notice of him, he thought every Bo|dy acquie&s;c'd with his Opinion, and that his Non&s;en&s;e pa&s;s'd as current with Mankind, as a Seaman's Ticket does for 7 <HI>s.</HI> and 6 <HI>d.</HI> in the Pound. It is impo&s;&s;ible for a Man that has no Reputation to bla&s;t the Credit of a|nother in the Opinion of good and ju&s;t Men, the only
<PB N="28" REF="17">Per&s;ons who&s;e Favour Ie&s;teem; and I can a&s;&s;ure young <HI>Fudg,</HI> if he adds a dung Cart full of Lies to the Wheel|barrow he has fill'd already, I &s;hould not &s;tain my Re|putation to rake in his Dirt. The reproaches of Fools, the &s;candals of the Rabble, are no cau&s;e of Re&s;entment to Men that know better how to employ their Thoughts; nor am I any more concerned at things of this nature, than the Moon, who keeps on her &s;teady and con&s;tant Cour&s;e, while all the little Dogs in the Pari&s;h are barking at her.</P>
