<HEAD>VVhat will you have? a CALFE with a WHITE FACE.</HEAD>
<P>_ALL tho&s;e who are troubled with the <HI>Grum|bling in the Gizzard,</HI> or the <HI>Fancies,</HI> whom no Government, or any Order, Rule or Pow|er in Church or State can content; all &s;uch as are never well (full or fa&s;ting) Who will have better Bread then is made of Wheat, with the re&s;t of that &s;tubborne and &s;tiffe-neck'd Generation; all the&s;e &s;orts of mi&s;chiefe-making Murmurers, that labour the ruine of all, for their own pecular profits and privat ends; &s;uch as only love them&s;elves, and yet hate one another dead|ly; all &s;uch I do freely invite to the eating of my <HI>Calfe with the white face.</HI></P>
<P>Now what this <HI>Calfe</HI> is, and what it is not, or from whence it came, and had it's breeding, is nece&s;&s;ary to be declared.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, this <HI>Calfe</HI> is not a <HI>golden Calfe,</HI> &s;uch a one as the two-legg'd <HI>Calves</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> wor&s;hip'd whil&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was in the Mount; nor &s;uch a one as the brace of <HI>Calves</HI> was, which <HI>Jeroeboam</HI> &s;et up, the one at <HI>Beth-el,</HI> the other at <HI>Dan.</HI> For if my <HI>Calfe</HI> had bin a <HI>golden Bea&s;t,</HI> 'tis ten to one he had bin Seque&s;trated, and ju&s;tly broken in peices, and tran&s;|form'd into a <HI>Molten Calfe,</HI> and con&s;equently coyned for &s;ome other u&s;es; nor is it an <HI>E&s;&s;ex Calfe,</HI> or <HI>Walthams Calfe,</HI> (that went nine miles to &s;uck a <HI>Bull,</HI> and came home againe thir&s;tie;) nor did I ever read, or hear, that any of the&s;e fore|named <HI>Calves</HI> had <HI>white faces.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I told you what my <HI>Calfe</HI> was not, is not, or ever like to be; now I tell you what he was, is, and will be.
<PB N="6" REF="3">It is but a little <HI>Calfe</HI> (for the greate&s;t <HI>Calves</HI> are not the &s;weete&s;t <HI>Veale</HI>) yet as little as it is, it is &s;pread univer&s;ally over the face of the Earth, and metamorpho&s;ed into a ge|neral Proverbe.</P>
<P>And though it be daily in the mouthes of thou&s;ands of people, yet it is never devoured or dimini&s;hed, much like a Taylours Goo&s;e, never to be eaten; a meere invi&s;ible <HI>Calfe.</HI></P>
<P>My wi&s;e, and dearly-beloved Cou&s;ins of <HI>London</HI> have fed upon it a long time; they grumbled and repined a|gain&s;t Peace and Plentie, they had more of Gods ble&s;&s;ings then they knew how to make right u&s;e of; their Allegeance lay &s;o heavie on their &s;tomacks, that too many of them gave mo&s;t part of their e&s;tates to have a publike faithful Vomit, which made them ca&s;t, and ca&s;t away &s;o extreamly, that a number of them were like to have ca&s;t their hearts out, and &s;o much over-&s;train'd them&s;elves, that they are cleane out of hope of recoverie, for they have no other earthly com|fort left, <HI>but a Calfe with a white face.</HI></P>
<P>And all tho&s;e that grudge again&s;t the ju&s;t Rights of the King, are ju&s;tly deprived of their ju&s;t Rights, which (by more then a good many) were unju&s;tly gotten; There was much <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Land bought, which Lands are fruitfull <HI>Fields</HI> in the <HI>Firmament,</HI> fat <HI>Pa&s;tures</HI> and <HI>Medowes</HI> in the <HI>Clouds,</HI> and &s;tately <HI>Ca&s;tles</HI> in the <HI>Ayre.</HI></P>
<P>A great number of mad men were po&s;&s;e&s;t with a conceit, that tho&s;e wi&s;e-Akers of invi&s;ible Land was to be &s;old and bought at ea&s;ie rates by the mea&s;ure of their owne feet; which cau&s;ed them to go to the Devills own Shoo-maker, who furni&s;ht them with Boots &amp; Shoos ju&s;t in the fa&s;hion of his owne cloven foot, of a reaching &s;ize, longer then the foot by three or four inches; forked as if they made hornes at every bodie they met, (a mo&s;t excellent policie to gaine
<PB N="3" REF="3">large penny-worths,) for which thriftie bargaine, they &s;hal be fea&s;ted with the head and braines of <HI>a Calfe with a white face.</HI></P>
<P>A wicked crew in the Citie and Countrie, who were imagined to be &s;tout and &s;trong <HI>Pillars</HI> of State; who&s;e Wi&s;edome, Integritie, and Loyalties, might have &s;up|ported the Church and Kingdomes in Peace and happie Government; But tho&s;e <HI>Pillars</HI> are proved to be no bet|ter then <HI>Cater-pillars,</HI> having devoured and &s;poyled all our fruitfull Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Spirituall and Temporall; in&s;o|much, that all tho&s;e that did put any tru&s;t or confidence in them, have &s;carce &s;o much hope left them as to feed upon the <HI>Calfe with a white face.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the Ea&s;t wind doth bring in the mo&s;t part and greate&s;t number of tho&s;e kind of de&s;troying Vermin, but we find (by lamentable experience) that all the winds have unfortunatly blown them into our Countrie, but the mo&s;t damnable &s;warmes of them were puffed with the blu&s;tring breath of <HI>Boreas,</HI> from the cold North.</P>
<P>Yet there are &s;ome among&s;t us who are grieved at the odds' and differences that we have, and if they had (or may get &s;o much power into their hands) they would &s;peedily make all our odds even, and end our divi&s;ions by dividing.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the upright-minded <HI>Levellers,</HI> that would have no King, no Magi&s;trate, no Law, no Religion, nor any Man to have more wealth of more wit and hone&s;tie then another; that every one might be equall, <HI>trim tram, rowly powly, Jack</HI> as good as <HI>Charles,</HI> and <HI>Joane</HI> as good as my La|die, all fellowes at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span">; But the&s;e fellowes &s;hall have the <HI>Calfe with the white face.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e kind of <HI>Levellers</HI> are of an ancient &s;tanding in <HI>England,</HI> and in truth they are no up&s;tarts: for neare 300 yeares agoe, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">eare of Grace 1380, the fifth yeare of
<PB N="6" REF="4">the raign of K. <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, by the &s;editious preach|ing of Par&s;on <HI>John Ball,</HI> they aro&s;e in Armes for the &s;ame Levelling purpo&s;e, and did much mi&s;chiefe in the King|dome, as you may read the full Storie in <HI>Stowes Chronicle,</HI> Page 292, and 293, to which Booke I refer &s;uch as de&s;ire further &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Now if every man were to be in an equalitie, we mu&s;t be all Rich men, or all poore; all Wi&s;e men, or all Fooles; all with &s;ight and limbs, or all blind and lame; all civill, or all mad; all &s;ober, or all drunkards; all hone&s;t men and women, or all Whores and Whore-ma&s;ters; all true men, or all Theeves; all old, or all young; all players, or all work|ers; all Labourers, or all Loyteters; all Gentlemen, or all Clownes and Pea&s;ants; &amp;c.</P>
<P>I could in&s;i&s;t further in this uneven kind of Levelling, but enough is &s;ufficient. <HI>Licurgus</HI> K. of <HI>Sparta,</HI> or <HI>Lacede|demonia,</HI> when a Fellow asked him, whether hee did not hold it very nece&s;&s;itie to lay all degrees of Per&s;ons and their E&s;tates <HI>Levell</HI> throughout all his Dominions, the K. an&s;wered him, <HI>That he would have him, and all the re&s;t which were of his mind to begin fir&s;t to make all Per&s;ons equall, and lay all levell in their owne hou&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But now I have done with my <HI>Calfe,</HI> and my <HI>Calfe</HI> hath done with me; for a <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Pedlar hath gotten him from me, and carried away by Sea from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> as this &s;hort following relation doth declare.</P>
<P>There was a ripe-witted young Lad, borne and brought up North-ward beyond <HI>Barwicke,</HI> betweene <HI>Edenborow</HI> and the <HI>High-Lands,</HI> his name was <HI>Malcolme Magrigger;</HI> This Fellow being of the age of eighteene yeares, left his Country, and &s;ailed in a Ship called the <HI>Mary-carry-knave</HI> into <HI>Poland;</HI> he had not been long there, but he was enter|tained by a <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Pedlar (who call them&s;elves Merchants
<PB N="7" REF="4">in that Countrie) and having &s;carce &s;erved his Ma&s;ter two yeares, he thriv'd &s;o well, that (by running away with his Ma&s;ters pack) he &s;et up for him&s;elfe, whereby he grew &s;o wickedly rich, that he left <HI>Poland</HI> and came into <HI>Holland;</HI> where at <HI>Am&s;terdam'd</HI> he hired a faire hou&s;e, with a &s;hop &amp; a large ware-hou&s;e, which he &s;tored with all manner of &s;uch commodities as he &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t vendible to others, and commodious to him&s;elf: You mu&s;t imagin now that you &s;ee him in's Shop with many Cu&s;tomers about him &amp; he very willing to take money as fa&s;t as he can.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, one came unto him and asked him if hee had any Religion to fell; he an&s;wered, that he was furni&s;hed with all Religions, and would &s;ell any man what he had mo&s;t mind unto, for there was varieties and choyce enough. Looke you Sir, heare is Poperie, if you like it I will afford you a good penny-worth.</P>
<P>The other replied, that it was old and &s;tale, and that it had a poore thing in it called Charitie, (which the Papi&s;ts do imagine to be good-workes) which I hold to be an errone|ous kind of Doctrine, for I am per&s;waded, that good works are not meritotious, and therefore my &s;elfe, (with many thou&s;ands more of my opinion) never did any, and as near as we can, never meane to trouble our &s;elves with the doing of any. Then &s;aid the Merchant; Sir, I would be glad to take your mony, I pray you take your choyce; &s;ee here, will you buy the Prote&s;tant Religion, I tell you it is a good old one, and the old way is the good way, and the be&s;t way. It was an&s;wered. That the Prote&s;tant Profe&s;&s;ion did flouri&s;h a long time in <HI>England,</HI> till the mad people did mangle and tatter it into ragged Shreds and Sects, and though you have it to &s;ell, yet i thinke no man is &s;o mad as to buy it, for it teacheth Obedience, Loyaltie, and Allegeance to Kings &amp; Princes; Then &s;aid the Merchant, Sir, I thinke you came
<PB N="8" REF="5">not to buy or bargaine; I cannot plea&s;e your humour, <HI>will you have a Calfe with a white face?</HI></P>
<P>Then came an old Ladie of the la&s;t edition friend (quoth &s;he) have you any new fa&s;hions to &s;ell for Ladies, Gentlemen, and E|&s;quire? Laidie (&s;aid he) I have the be&s;t and newe&s;t within the walls of <HI>Afrique</HI> or <HI>America;</HI> here are mo&s;t exqui&s;it black patch|es for the face, to illu&s;trate &amp; make the beautie the more con&s;picu|ous; here they are in the formes of Flyes, Fleas, Monkeys, and Mag-Pyes, Sun, Moone, Starres, Owles and Pole-Cats: I can a&s;|&s;ure you Ladie there is much art in the creation of them, and they are in &s;uch reque&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> that a Gentlewoman gave 100 li. for a black patch in the forme of a Coach and foure Hor&s;es, which patch was no bigger then the compa&s;&s;e of a <HI>Scotch</HI> three pence. Tu&s;h (quoth &s;he) I came to buy no &s;uch bables, I would have bought &s;ome Hone&s;tie, Mode&s;tie; and Cha&s;titie, for my &s;elfe, and for my Daughters and Maid-&s;ervants: Pi&s;h quoth he, your Lady&s;hip doth not well know what you would have, <HI>will you have a Calfe with a white face?</HI></P>
<P>Come Gentlemen, what lack ye? here are fine Ribands of all colours to weare for favours round your Hats, or to garni&s;h and adorn your Codpiece for the honour and exaltation of the Toole of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; Come along Cu&s;tomers; here are curious Salt-Sellers and Knives hefte made of black, white, and gray marble, out of the Ruins and Reliques of old Charing Cro&s;&s;e; here is a fine Shooing-Horne made out of part of the nayle of <HI>Gargantu's</HI> little finger, here are Dice made of the Eye-Teeth of the famous Witch of <HI>Endor:</HI> What, are you all lookers on and gaping-gazers, will nothing fit you, will you have <HI>a Calfe with a white face?</HI></P>
<P>Here is a rare piece of workman&s;hip, a brave Picture of a good King to be &s;old, his per&s;on hath been bought, &s;old and bartered, more times then he hath fingers and toes; come buy, buy.</P>
<P>What lack ye Sir? Then &s;aid an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man, have you any <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Bookes? yes Sir, I have Bookes of Roguerie, Vilianie, Lyes, Perfect Currant Lyes, Moderate Lyes, Lyes of all &s;hapes &amp; &s;izes: The other replyed, a pox take 'em, we have too many of them in <HI>England,</HI> they are as plenty full as durt, and cryed every day a|bout the &s;treets of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> for pence a peece. The Pediat an&s;wered, Sir, I have none that will give you content, I thinke you would have <HI>a Calfe with a white face;</HI> farewell, good night, I will &s;hut up my Shop with</P>
