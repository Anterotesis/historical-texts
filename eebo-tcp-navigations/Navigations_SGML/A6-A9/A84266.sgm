<HEAD>To this I have thought good to adde a fit di&s;cour&s;e that doth &s;ome|what allure to this.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen that England and Scotland was in Contention, the T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ki&s;h EMPEROUR had an intention invade them; and take the ad|vantage of their civill di&s;cord; to which end he &s;ummoned all <HI>Ba&s;hames</HI> and <HI>Beglerbegs,</HI> giving them notice of his intention, withall demanding their advice, which mo&s;t of them did, applauding the de&s;igne, but one among the re&s;t &s;tood up, and de&s;ired a hearing, which being granted, hee told the Emperour that in a dreame his fancie &s;hewed him a vi&s;ion which was as followeth.</P>
<P>He thought he faw two brothers fighting &s;orely for a prize, and during their combate there came a thiefe and endeaeoured to fei&s;e the prize which they fought for, which the two brothers &s;eeing, left fighting with one a|nother and beat him &s;orely, taking him and
<PB N="6" REF="5">binding him hand and foote, and carried him into eternall captivity.</P>
<P><HI>Great Emperour</HI> (&s;ayes he) though England and Scotland jarre in private contention, and hurt one another &s;orely, yet if any forraigne e|nemy &s;hould venture upon them they will like the two brothers full upon him and doubtle&s;&s;e great will be his overthrow.</P>
<P>The Emperour heard this and de&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;igne, e&s;teeming his coun&s;elled the be&s;t, giving him great thankes, &s;aying thou ha&s;t well coun&s;elld.</P>
<P>This may be applyed to Spaine, and I doe pray heartily that it would plea&s;e God to putt into his Maje&s;ties heart to joyne with the Par|liament, that &s;o the&s;e forces might be employ|ed again&s;t Spain which &s;eekes the ruine of the Church and Prote&s;tant Religion, that as in England &s;o in Ireland, Gods word may flouri&s;h and the whore of Babilon bee utterly de&s;troy|ed.</P>
