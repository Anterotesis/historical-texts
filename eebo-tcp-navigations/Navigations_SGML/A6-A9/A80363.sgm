<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS Humbly Offer'd To the Honourable <HI>HOUSE of COMMONS,</HI> BY THE Planters, and Others, trading to our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations, in Relation to the <HI>African</HI> Company's Petition, now before this Honourable HOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT it being of &s;o great Importance to this Nation to encourage and &s;upport the Plantations, it will be of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to have them plentifully &s;upply'd with Negroes, by who&s;e Labour all the Commo|dities of tho&s;e Countries are produc'd; which Production is all clear Gains to this Nation, and better than the Mines of Gold and Silver are to the <HI>Spa|niards;</HI> which can never be throughly done otherwi&s;e, than by a free open Trade, with|out being confin'd to the narrow Compa&s;s of a few People, in a &s;mall Joint-Stock.</P>
<P>There is not a Negro but produceth as much Commodity, either Sugar, Indigo, Tobacco, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as will load one Tun of Shipping; the Increa&s;e of which Produce will al&s;o largely increa&s;e the Con&s;umption of the Woollen, and other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu|factures, and augment the Revenues of the Crown.</P>
<P>A great Quantity of the Product of our Plantation-Commodities will enable the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants to make large Exportations to foreign Markets, and put them into a Capacity to under-&s;ell all other Nations, that vie with us in the &s;ame Com|modities; which will not only di&s;courage their Plantations, but greatly encourage our own.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>African</HI> Company do &s;et forth in their Petition, That by their Charge in maintaining their Forts and Ca&s;tles, in &s;ecuring that Trade on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> the We&s;tern Plantations have been furni&s;hed with Negroes; we the Planters do &s;ay, That we have paid a Duty of 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for the &s;ame, and that had it not been more for the Separate Traders than the <HI>African</HI> Company, &s;ince the opening of the &s;aid Trade by the late Act of Parliament, the Plantations had been but poor|ly &s;erved; for by Experience, we have found much greater Numbers of Negroes brought to our Plantations, than ever were during the time of the &s;aid <HI>African</HI> Company's having that Trade in their own Hands, exclu&s;ive of all others.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;ince the Plantations have receiv'd a more vi&s;ible Advantage from the <HI>African</HI> Trade, by having greater Quantities of Negroes brought among them by the Separate Traders, &s;ince the &s;aid Trade has been laid open, than ever were be|fore: And as the Product of our I&s;lands are largely increas'd thereby, we are hum|bly of Opinion, that the Intere&s;t of the Plantations is of infinitely greater Concern to be pre&s;erved, than any Company with a Joint-Stock can pretend to.</P>
<P REND="italic">Wherefore we hope, That the Honourable <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> will free us from the heavy Burden of the Duty of <HI>10 per Cent.</HI> which we conceive mu&s;t be advanced on the Price of Negroes; and that the &s;aid <HI>African</HI> Trade may be continu'd free and open to all People that de&s;ire to trade thither, under &s;uch Regulations as the Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> or as &s;hall be thought fit.</P>
