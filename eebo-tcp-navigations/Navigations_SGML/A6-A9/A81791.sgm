<P>HAving accidentally met with a &s;mall <HI>French Ma|nual,</HI> newly printed in <HI>France;</HI> I found it fraught with &s;uch <HI>excellent Advice</HI> and <HI>uncommon In|&s;tructions, not only</HI> for all Young Men in general, <HI>but more e&s;peci|ally</HI> for a Young Per&s;on upon his going <HI>a great Voyage by Sea,</HI> that I e&s;teem'd it well worthy (for the Benefit of <HI>our</HI> young

<HEAD>Moral In&s;tructions of a Fa|ther to his Son, upon his departure for a long Voy|age.</HEAD>
<P>YOU earne&s;tly intreated me, <HI>my Son,</HI> to agree to your de&s;ire of taking a Voyage into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and to be ab&s;ent for &s;ome Years. I did &s;o little expect &s;uch a Pro|po&s;al from you, that it wholly &s;urprized me, and I had &s;everal Rea&s;ons per&s;uading me you could not be capable of making a Re&s;olution of this nature. So many things ought to concur thereto, that at fir&s;t Thoughts I imagined, that either the Youthful and Ardent De&s;ires (inhe|rent in tho&s;e of your Age) of travelling into Foreign Countries, had made you take up this Re&s;olution; or that it was perhaps only to try that Paternal Affe|ction
<PB N="2" REF="9">which has ever been towards you mo&s;t indulgent. Whatever it be, it is convenient that I put you in mind how I have acted all along in this Affair, and you ought to approve of my Proceedings. You know that while I endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade you from this De&s;ign, I did not onely make you recall to mind all tho&s;e &s;weet and plea&s;ant hours you have &s;pent hitherto under the Roof of a loving Fa|ther, and rendred you &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>Cares</HI> and <HI>Toils</HI> you were to undergo during your whole Voyage, in&s;tead of that <HI>Tranquility</HI> which lay in your pow|er to enjoy: But I al&s;o demon&s;trated to you, how many &s;everal Rea&s;ons did ob|lige you not to abandon me; yet &s;eeing you e&s;teemed the&s;e Rea&s;ons of too little force to make you change your Re&s;o|lution, I oppos'd it by the con&s;ideration of the great <HI>Hazards</HI> in your <HI>Pa&s;&s;age:</HI> In order thereunto I laid before you the danger of <HI>Shipwrack, Pirats,</HI> and <HI>Incon|veniencies</HI> both infinite and unavoidable in &s;uch a long Voyage, principally to a Young Man bred &s;o tenderly, and edu|cated with that Care as you have bin. All this was not &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;uade
<PB N="3" REF="9">you, &s;o that I was forced at length to yield to your reque&s;t, whereto the a&s;&s;u|rance you gave me did not a little con|tribute, that the impatience of becom|ing more worthy of my &s;ingular Care in your Education, did prompt you to this, be&s;ides your mentioning what Joy you &s;hould conceive to &s;hare the Pains I take to increa&s;e your Fortune. The Prote&s;ta|tions of this truth made to me in private, and reiterated in the pre&s;ence of our Re|lations, who I was willing &s;hould be wit|ne&s;&s;es of my Carriage towards you in an Affair of this importance, prevented my making u&s;e of an ab&s;olute Authority, (given to me as a Father) to force you to comply with my Will; and that for three Rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall the more gladly impart to you, becau&s;e I am pre&s;ua|ded the knowledg of them will excite you to acknowledge my Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, That altho many Fathers will admit of no Limits in Filial Obedi|ence, and their claim thereto being of Divine Right, yet I can &s;ay I never took &s;uch advantage over you by this Right, as to u&s;e it in it's utmo&s;t Rigour: Of this I have given you more than one
<PB N="4" REF="10">Proof, and you may remember, that as often as your Conduct brought upon you my Correction, in the greate&s;t and mo&s;t lawful Cau&s;es I had of being incen|&s;ed, I always allayed the heat of tho&s;e Provocations, cau&s;ed through your In|di&s;cretion, with the Fondne&s;s of a tender Father. You know I have <HI>Contracted</HI> the <HI>Bounds</HI> of your obedience, and <HI>ex|tended tho&s;e</HI> of my Kindne&s;s to what&s;oe|ver you could pretend; and in putting you in mind of your <HI>Duty,</HI> by the&s;e words of St. <HI>Paul; Children, obey your Parents in all things, for this is well-plea&s;ing unto the Lord;</HI> I was exhorted to mine, by the words following: <HI>Fathers, provoke not your Children to Anger, lea&s;t they be di&s;couraged.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The &s;econd Rea&s;on,</HI> which obliged me not to with&s;tand ab&s;olutely your Inten|tions, was to avoid the Reproaches which you might reflect upon me hereafter, that my refu&s;al had bin an Ob&s;tacle to your Fortune.</P>
<P><HI>And the la&s;t</HI> was, the Fear I had le&s;t you &s;hould have made u&s;e of that very refu&s;al for a Pretext to ju&s;tifie ever after all defects in your Proceedings.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="10">
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons, <HI>my Son,</HI> were the Cau&s;e of my complying &s;o ea&s;ily with your re|que&s;t. I could have wi&s;hed you would have altered your Intentions, to plea&s;e me; but &s;eeing that you could not con|form to my Sentiments, and that you &s;till per&s;i&s;t in your de&s;ign, after having implored the <HI>Almighty</HI> to grant you his Grace, and to Shower down the mo&s;t precious of his Ble&s;&s;ings upon your <HI>Soul,</HI> your <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> and your <HI>Actions,</HI> I think it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, (for to &s;atisfie my Inclination and Duty) not to let you go without &s;ome peculiar In&s;tructions, which may be as a Guide to your Manners, and which mo&s;t certainly will be con|vincing Proofs of my Kindne&s;s, as al&s;o inexhau&s;tible Springs of future happine&s;s, in your Conver&s;ation both Spiritual and Civil, if you will apply your &s;elf to them, which I exhort and command you to do. However let what will happen, the&s;e In&s;tructions will remain as &s;o many irre|fragable Witne&s;&s;es, how zealou&s;ly I en|deavoured to do <HI>my Duty,</HI> if unhapily you &s;hould be wanting <HI>in yours.</HI></P>
<P>By telling you, <HI>my dear Son,</HI> that the&s;e In&s;tructions which I am about to give
<PB N="6" REF="11">you, are the Effects of my <HI>Inclination</HI> and <HI>Duty,</HI> I have inverted that order which Rea&s;on requires: I &s;hould rather have &s;aid, the&s;e Effects proceeded from my <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Inclination,</HI> and &s;o have preferred <HI>Duty before Inclination,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is governed by <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> whereas the <HI>latter</HI> is but an <HI>Incitement</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> who is not &s;eldom blinded by tho&s;e ten|der Impul&s;es which Proximity of Blood in&s;pires. But I was overcome by a Weak|ne&s;s, common to mo&s;t Fathers, which I do not &s;tick to confe&s;s, to the intent you may be per&s;waded, that in this following Di&s;cour&s;e I rather fell into a great Indul|gence, than that I maintained a Severity too Au&s;tere.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o not without &s;ome My&s;tery, <HI>my Son,</HI> that in wi&s;hing you the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> I would have them applied to your <HI>Soul,</HI> your <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> and your <HI>Actions.</HI> The order of the&s;e Words is one of the Duties whereon I &s;hall give you &s;ome In|&s;tructions, which I enjoyn you to ob&s;erve and practice. I divide it into three parts, <HI>Spiritual, Per&s;onal,</HI> and <HI>Civil Duties:</HI> the fir&s;t &s;hall teach you your <HI>Duty to God;</HI> the &s;econd, your <HI>Duty to your &s;elf;</HI> and the
<PB N="7" REF="11">la&s;t &s;hall in&s;truct you in your <HI>Duty to your Neighbour.</HI> If I &s;hould go about to treat of this Matter to an extent as great as it's Importance, I ought, in&s;tead of a few Pages I intend for you, to write &s;everal Volumes: but this being wide of my De&s;ign, as al&s;o far above my Abilities, I &s;hall re&s;t &s;atisfied in being as conci&s;e as this matter can po&s;&s;ibly allow. God grant through his Grace, that I may be in&s;pi|red with Arguments, both &s;o clear and &s;trong, as to equalize the greatne&s;s of my Enterprize; and that through his Good|ne&s;s, he may encline you to put them in Practice for his Glory, for your Salvati|on, for my Satisfaction, and for your Profit and Advancement.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Spiritual Duties.</HEAD>
<P>YOU learned in your Childhood, <HI>my Son,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> created you to <HI>know</HI> him, and to <HI>&s;erve</HI> him. The&s;e two Obligations which bind you from your Birth, have Relation to the two chief <HI>Fa|culties</HI> of the <HI>Soul.</HI> The <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>God</HI> belongs to the <HI>&V;nder&s;tanding,</HI> and the <HI>Service</HI> of him to the <HI>Will;</HI> but the Light
<PB N="8" REF="12">of our Under&s;tanding has too narrow li|mits ever to arrive to the perfect Know|ledge of his Divinity, and the Will of Man is too perver&s;e to be capable of &s;er|ving him as we ought. The&s;e Impedi|ments which grow out of the abundance of our Corruption, mu&s;t neverthele&s;s not di&s;courage us; <HI>A brui&s;ed Reed God &s;hall not break, and &s;moaking Flax &s;hall he not quench:</HI> He fulfils his Power in our Weakne&s;&s;es; he &s;upplies our Wants; he helps our Infirmities; and he, knowing that of our &s;elves we cannot a&s;cend to him, out of his Divine Goodne&s;s is plea|&s;ed to come down to us. He not only makes u&s;e of his Word and his Works to imprint in our Minds &s;ome kind of <HI>Idea</HI> of his Greatne&s;s, which we may not wholly conceive; but al&s;o, through the Communication of his Holy Spirit he corrects our Inclinations; and when he has made them <HI>to will</HI> what naturally they <HI>would not,</HI> he al&s;o forces them <HI>to act</HI> it by a &s;weet &s;ort of Violence which we cannot re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>My Son,</HI> read this Word, and that as often as po&s;&s;ibly you may; but read it with great <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> and <HI>Attention:</HI> 'Tis the
<PB N="9" REF="12">Voice of <HI>God:</HI> This Rea&s;on mu&s;t oblige you to the <HI>Respect;</HI> and 'tis for your In|&s;truction you read it: this &s;hould force you to the <HI>Attention</HI> I demand of you. Set apart &s;ome hours for this &s;acred Stu|dy, which on <HI>Sunday</HI> ought to be two at lea&s;t, and one upon each <HI>other Day.</HI> Be careful that upon no account you ne|glect this Duty. The greate&s;t of all Con|&s;iderations is that of your Salvation: quit all others that you may not fail in this; and let not any intere&s;t or plea&s;ure here upon Earth make you forget tho&s;e Joys of Heaven. The World, and all worldly De&s;ires pa&s;s away, but he who&s;e De&s;ire is the Will of <HI>God</HI> &s;hall live eter|nally. This Will you may learn in his holy Word. Yet what will &s;ignifie the Knowledge of it, but to render your &s;elf more guilty, unle&s;s you u&s;e your utmo&s;t Endeavours to be conformable thereto? That Servant <HI>who knoweth</HI> the <HI>Will</HI> of his <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>doth it not,</HI> &s;hall be beaten with more Stripes than he who never knew it. Remember this with Fear and Trembling. However, all your Care would be in vain if God him&s;elf did not help you to bring to pa&s;s what he requires;
<PB N="10" REF="13">therefore always beg that Grace of him. 'Tis a very great benefit that he permits us to &s;peak to him; yet it is a benefit much greater, that not only he vouch&s;afes to let us &s;peak to him in our Prayers, but al&s;o promi&s;eth through his Mercy to hear us; <HI>Call upon me,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver thee.</HI> Implore him then, <HI>my Son,</HI> but let your Prayers a&s;cend upon the Wings of Faith and Fer|vency; for God can no more love tho&s;e who want Zeal, than tho&s;e that mi&s;tru&s;t his Goodne&s;s. Ask earne&s;tly of him that he accompli&s;h in you, by his Vertue om|nipotent, what&s;oever he commands; and be not weary of performing &s;o holy an Exerci&s;e. Be&s;eech him earne&s;tly to direct your ways, that you may follow after him. Implore him ince&s;&s;antly, that he would rai&s;e you from that Sepulchre of Sins wherein you lye buried. The&s;e are they, who by their Prayers &s;torm the Kingdom of Heaven, and take it by force. Follow the Example of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who by a <HI>holy Importunity</HI> gained a Ble&s;&s;ing from <HI>God.</HI> Without &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing, all your Labour, Care, and Diligence, will be em|ployed in vain. <HI>Except the Lord build the
<PB N="11" REF="13">Hou&s;e they labour in vain that build it. Be|gin</HI> and <HI>end</HI> the Day with <HI>Prayer,</HI> and be con&s;tant in your Morning and Evening Sacrifice. If you hope to obtain what you ask of <HI>God,</HI> let your Heart pray rather than your Lips; with a devout Zeal, and not for Fa&s;hion-&s;ake. Begin your <HI>Pray|ers</HI> with Joy and Gladne&s;s, go through with them cheerfully, and do not end them without a &s;orrowful Reluctancy that you mu&s;t leave off. But above all, let this <HI>Beginning,</HI> this <HI>Continuance,</HI> and this <HI>End,</HI> be without any wandering of your Mind. Frighten away tho&s;e Birds which come to trouble your Sacrifice; that is, put far from you tho&s;e Thoughts which may be the lea&s;t hinderance to your De|votion. To pray to God without Atten|tion, in&s;tead of plea&s;ing doth offend him; it is a Sacriledge rather than an Offering. Our being &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed for heavenly things renders this Attention difficult. Yet it is mo&s;t certain, that from <HI>thence</HI> we have mo&s;t rea&s;on to derive the Succe&s;s of our Prayers; for <HI>God</HI> cannot grant our Reque&s;ts unle&s;s he hear us, and how &s;hould we expect to have <HI>tho&s;e Prayers</HI> heard which we our &s;elves do not hear?
<PB N="12" REF="14">Upon this very Account, <HI>God</HI> may apply to us what he &s;aid in time pa&s;t to the <HI>Jews; This People draw near me with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Hearts far from me.</HI> Judge therefore, <HI>my Son,</HI> if we have not great rea&s;on to &s;earch diligently after the <HI>Means</HI> which will bring us to this Attention.</P>
<P>I have here &s;et down &s;ome few Rules or Means, the Practice whereof I take to be very advantageous, and con&s;equently not to be neglected.</P>
<P>We may pray to <HI>God</HI> in <HI>all Places,</HI> but all Places are not equally proper for this Duty. When thou praye&s;t, &s;aith our <HI>Saviour, enter into thy Clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret.</HI> This Advice which the Saviour of the World gives concerning Prayer, teacheth us that we mu&s;t retire our &s;elves when we Pray, and mu&s;t be &s;o far from making our Prayers the Subject of <HI>Humane Applau&s;e,</HI> that we mu&s;t <HI>pray &s;ecretly;</HI> which not only our Divine Ma&s;ter did confirm by his own Example, but al&s;o before he gave his Apo&s;tles that Coun&s;el of withdrawing in private, he told them: <HI>When ye pray, be not as the
<PB N="13" REF="14">Hypocrites are: For they love to pray &s;tand|ing in the</HI> Synagogues, <HI>and in the corners of the Streets, that they may be &s;een of Men.</HI> Ob&s;erve the&s;e Maxims, and when you would offer up your Prayers, let it be <HI>in Private;</HI> for going to an Exerci&s;e which obligeth you to fly the World, let not any thing that is worldly accom|pany you at that time. Do not imitate the Example of <HI>Rachel,</HI> who leaving her Fathers Hou&s;e carried with her tho&s;e Images, which were the Object of his Idolatry. Follow rather that of <HI>Elijah,</HI> who, when he drew near to <HI>God,</HI> in the Chariot wherein he was carried from this World, let fall his Mantle, that he might have no Earthly thing with him. <HI>Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy Shooes from off thy Feet, for the place whereon thou &s;tan|de&s;t is holy Ground,</HI> &s;aid the <HI>Eternal</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when he &s;pake to him out of the burning Bu&s;h. This Voice is al&s;o direct|ed to you. When at any time you have a mind to pray, the place you choo&s;e out for that purpo&s;e you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;anctified with the pre&s;ence of <HI>God.</HI> Put off then your Shooes, that it may not be defiled; that is, relinqui&s;h all your
<PB N="14" REF="15">Thoughts which &s;avour of the World or the Fle&s;h. Depart from <HI>Sodom,</HI> with|out looking behind you; and having di&s;po&s;ed things in this order, fall down upon your Knees before you begin your Devotion, &s;pare &s;ome &s;mall time to think upon the infinite Greatne&s;s of him you are about to implore, and to con&s;ider your own extream Meanne&s;s. If <HI>&s;uch a Meditati|on as this</HI> is &s;erious, it mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity redouble your Zeal, and render you more fit to approach the Divine Maje&s;ty. One great Rea&s;on why our Mind is too often alienated at Prayer is, the Diver&s;ity of Objects which our Eyes meet with, there|fore to prevent this great inconvenience, I think it Nece&s;&s;ary to keep them &s;hut. This Advice, <HI>my Son,</HI> is not of the lea&s;t Moment, fail not to try it, and then make u&s;e of it according as you find it &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>I do not pre&s;cribe you the u&s;e of any particular Prayers; your Di&s;cretion ought to make choice of &s;uch as are &s;uitable to the Subject which <HI>occa&s;ions</HI> your Prayers. However I think it will not be ami&s;s, that all the Reque&s;ts you make to <HI>God</HI> be com|pri&s;ed in this one, <HI>that of his Love.</HI> This is the way to have all; for he who has
<PB N="15" REF="15"><HI>God</HI> with him can want nothing. <HI>Solomon</HI> asked of him only Wi&s;dom, and <HI>God</HI> &s;aid to him, <HI>Becau&s;e that thou ha&s;t asked this thing, and that thou ha&s;t not asked for thy &s;elf long Life; neither ha&s;t asked Riches; nor the Life of thine Enemies; but ha&s;t asked for thy &s;elf &V;nder&s;tanding: It &s;hall be given thee; and I will give thee that which thou ha&s;t not asked, both Riches and Ho|nour. Plato,</HI> although a <HI>Pagan,</HI> may be an <HI>Example</HI> to many Chri&s;tians to teach them for what things they ought to pray. It was his cu&s;tom in <HI>his Prayers</HI> to &s;ay thus: <HI>O God grant me tho&s;e things that are good, when I ask them not, and deny me, when I ask for tho&s;e things that are evil. God</HI> often favours us by not hearing our Prayers, and &s;ometimes puni&s;heth us by granting our reque&s;ts, when we pray for that which is pernicious to our welfare; as we common|ly do, for as our Lord JESUS CHRIST &s;aid, we often know not what we ask.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians order tho&s;e who have a weak Stomach, to eat little and often. If it be hard for you to keep up your Attention, (which is the Soul of Prayer,) do you after the &s;ame manner, and following the Coun|&s;el of our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour,</HI> when you pray,
<PB N="16" REF="16" MS="y"><HI>u&s;e not vain repetitions as the Heathen do; for they think they &s;hall be heard for their much &s;peaking.</HI> If therefore your Prayers mu&s;t be &s;hort, let them be the more fre|quent, but chiefly, I &s;hall once again ex|hort you to this; Let neither your Zeal nor your Faith be wanting.</P>
<P><HI>My Son,</HI> if you remember, I &s;aid we might pray to <HI>God</HI> in <HI>all Places,</HI> though all places were not equally <HI>Proper</HI> for this Exerci&s;e; Yet if we con&s;ider Prayer to be (as we mu&s;t not doubt) a darting forth of our Soul towards <HI>God,</HI> to unite it with his Holy Spirit; why cannot we do this <HI>every Hour,</HI> if not <HI>every Moment</HI> in the Day, where&s;oever we are, at home or abroad? And why cannot we often turn our Hearts to <HI>God,</HI> though in the mid&s;t of our mo&s;t important Affairs, and in walking, whe|ther it be in the City, or in the Country? To do thus, is to pray to him. The Heart of Man is a <HI>moving Clo&s;et,</HI> a Place of Retirement; a holy Solitude, where we may enter every Moment, and from thence &s;end &s;uch fervent (though &s;hort) Ejaculations as &s;hall penetrate Heaven, and be more acceptable to <HI>God,</HI> than tho&s;e long Prayers which too often want At|tention.
<PB N="17" REF="16">The&s;e Ejaculations are without doubt what the Evangeli&s;t means, when he exhorts us to <HI>pray always.</HI> And why, <HI>my Son,</HI> &s;hould you not ob&s;erve this good Cu&s;tom, of praying to <HI>God,</HI> and prai&s;ing him <HI>in your Bed,</HI> when&s;oever you happen to awake, &s;ince Prayer is &s;o much the <HI>principal part</HI> of Divine Wor&s;hip, that the Scripture comprehends thereby all Religi|ous Duties.</P>
<P>This, <HI>my Son,</HI> is the chiefe&s;t of what I had to &s;ay to you concerning Prayer in particular: But take notice you cannot pray to <HI>God</HI> without putting your Tru&s;t in him, neither can you put your tru&s;t in <HI>God</HI> without loving him. Love him then if you expect his Love. Fear him if you de&s;ire to be wi&s;e; for <HI>the Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wi&s;dom.</HI> This fear, as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;aid, is to hate and avoid all evil, and con&s;equently to do good. If you fear <HI>God,</HI> you will love him, and if you love him, you will keep his Com|mandements: <HI>my Son,</HI> you know all tho&s;e Commandements; let nothing then be an Ob&s;tacle to your Practice of them.</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> is a Spirit, and the Truth, and he will be wor&s;hipped in Spirit and Truth. This
<PB N="18" REF="17">Religion, wherein (through his goodne&s;s) you was born, for the full and perfect Knowledge whereof, I have throughly cultivated your Under&s;tanding; This, I &s;ay, is the only natural Wor&s;hip which he requires. Adhere to this Wor&s;hip, and you will find it more advantageous to you, than the Star was to tho&s;e Shepherds whom it guided to <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> for that only led them to JESUS CHRIST in his lowe&s;t E|&s;tate, whereas this Wor&s;hip &s;hall conduct you to him in his Glory. This Divine <HI>Savi|our</HI> of the World, &s;peaking of him&s;elf to St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</HI> And 'tis the only way through which we mu&s;t go to the Father. Stray not from it, <HI>my Son,</HI> what&s;oever may be|fall you: For in&s;tead of Springs which you will find in this Way, flowing with living Water, every where out of it you &s;hall meet with puddles of Water both impure and loath&s;ome. You cannot go out of this Path wherein you have entred with|out departing from <HI>God,</HI> and con&s;equent|ly from all tho&s;e Joys whereof he is the Center. Let neither <HI>Wealth, Honour,</HI> nor <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> lead you a&s;ide; and though you &s;uffer the mo&s;t rigorous Per&s;ecutions, yet
<PB N="19" REF="17">be not di&s;heartned. E&s;teem it as a great Honour to bear the Cro&s;s after your <HI>Sa|viour;</HI> it would be an honourable Re|proach to you, to have your Body mark|ed and brui&s;ed for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t. This is the way, through which all the Martyrs have pa&s;&s;ed, to enter into tho&s;e heavenly Joys. If <HI>God</HI> &s;hould call you to &s;uch Proofs, turn not away, for the <HI>lea&s;t Thron</HI> falling from our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Crown upon your Head, will affix thereto a <HI>Crown of Glory:</HI> If therefore you happen to &s;uffer for <HI>Chri&s;ts</HI> &s;ake, be not a&s;hamed, but ra|ther prai&s;e and glorifie <HI>God</HI> for it.</P>
<P>Sickne&s;s, Lo&s;s of Per&s;ons dear to us, Lo&s;s of Goods, Wealth, and an infinite number more of unwelcome Accidents, compo&s;e generally the <HI>Series</HI> of our Life. <HI>My Son,</HI> do not think you can avoid them. The Afflictions of this World are mo&s;t certain Characters of the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> wherewith he corrects tho&s;e he loves, as a Father u&s;eth a rod to cha&s;ti&s;e the Child whom he tenderly cheri&s;heth. 'Tis true the Fle&s;h takes no delight in being cha&s;ti&s;ed, neither are we to hearken to <HI>Fle&s;hly Sentiments</HI> when we would put in practice what is nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvati|on.
<PB N="20" REF="18">If it is <HI>God</HI>'s good Plea&s;ure you &s;hould undergo Afflictions, of what nature, or how &s;harp &s;oever, murmur not. Take heed when you &s;uffer, it be <HI>not de&s;erved|ly:</HI> And remember in your &s;ufferings, though exceeding great, that they can|not be equal to the Glory, which will be your reward hereafter. The&s;e afflictions (which if the right u&s;e be made of them immediately pa&s;s away) will produce in your Mind the Brightne&s;s of that tran&s;|cendent Glory. Moral Philo&s;ophy teach|eth us, that Vices of all &s;orts &s;pring from Pa&s;&s;ions di&s;order'd, whereas from regu|lated Pa&s;&s;ions do proceed all Vertues; And Chri&s;tian Divinity doth verifie by experience, that afflictions, which in Reprobates occa&s;ion nothing but De&s;pair, are to the Faithful &s;o many inexhau&s;tible Fountains of Joy.</P>
<P>The Rods which <HI>God</HI> makes u&s;e of to puni&s;h the Wicked, are like that of <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> which turned into a <HI>Serpent;</HI> and tho&s;e wherewith he cha&s;ti&s;eth his Chil|dren, have a re&s;emblance to that of <HI>Aaron,</HI> which brought forth <HI>Flowers</HI> and <HI>Fruit.</HI> Make good u&s;e of them, <HI>My Son;</HI> Ki&s;s tho&s;e Rods wherewith he corrects you;
<PB N="21" REF="18">adore the &s;ecret Vertue in them, and, e|ven in the mo&s;t Severe Cha&s;ti&s;ements, ac|knowledge his Divine Goodne&s;s in rai|&s;ing you out of that heavy Sleep wherein Sin may have ca&s;t you. If they are more &s;harp than Fle&s;h could wi&s;h for, believe that it is for your good to be thus afflicted for a little time, <HI>that the trial of your Faith being much more precious than of Gold that peri&s;heth, tho it be tried with Fire, might be found unto Prai&s;e, and Honour, and Glo|ry, at the appearing of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>My Son,</HI> you ought to have ob&s;erved, that I have reduced under <HI>four Heads</HI> all the Duties of a Spiritual Life; <HI>viz: Reading the Word of God with Attention; frequent and ardent Prayers; a con&s;tant Per&s;everence in the Faith;</HI> and <HI>a perfect and entire Re&s;ignation to the Will of God,</HI> tho he expo&s;e you to be tried by the mo&s;t bitter Calamities. If you had &s;till remained with me, I &s;hould have given you the&s;e very In&s;tructions, the <HI>two fir&s;t</HI> whereof I have bin very careful in ma|king you practice as &s;oon as your Age would permit it: Therefore I could not but think them more nece&s;&s;ary to you when you are from me, and chiefly in
<PB N="22" REF="19">a Country, where, far from having the Comfort of a publick Exerci&s;e of your Religion, you will &s;carce ever &s;ee an Example of the lea&s;t Piety; which ought the rather to oblige you to practi&s;e mo&s;t exactly the Advice I have now given you. <HI>I do exhort you to</HI> it by the Bowels of Mercy of our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour; I require</HI> it of you by the Care you ought to have of your Salvation; and <HI>I do en|treat</HI> you to do it by that Complai&s;ance which I have rea&s;on to expect from your Gratitude. If you follow this Coun&s;el, you will render to <HI>God</HI> what is due to him, you will accompli&s;h the demands of your <HI>Father;</HI> and thereby you may di&s;charge that Duty you owe to <HI>your &s;elf;</HI> wherein I &s;hall in&s;truct you in the &s;econd Di&s;cour&s;e, which, according to the me|thod I pre&s;cribed, mu&s;t treat of <HI>Per&s;onal Duties.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Per&s;onal Duties.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been more conci&s;e in the fir&s;t Part, which treats of your <HI>Duty to|wards God,</HI> than I &s;hall be in this, which concerns your <HI>Duty to your &s;elf,</HI> or in the
<PB N="23" REF="19">next following, which comprehends your <HI>Duty to your Neighbour:</HI> and 'tis no hard matter to ju&s;tifie my Proceedings in this Point: I have followed the Example of <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf; for, of the <HI>Ten Command|ments,</HI> whereof his Law is compo&s;ed, there are but <HI>four</HI> which have immediate Re|gard to <HI>his Service,</HI> whereas there are <HI>&s;ix</HI> to guide us in our <HI>Duty towards our Neigh|bour.</HI> There is no Nation &s;o ignorant or bruti&s;h but believeth in &s;ome <HI>God,</HI> and at the &s;ame time prepares a form of Wor&s;hip whereby to &s;hew their Obedience; &s;o true it is that the Belief of a God doth imply a Duty of &s;erving him not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with: and this is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that altho &s;ome Men might be &s;o irre|ligious as not to acknowledge it, they mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be convinced of it in their Con&s;cience. Your Mind, <HI>my Son,</HI> is repleni&s;hed with this Knowledge, let it then pa&s;s from thence into your Will; and with <HI>tho&s;e Lights,</HI> wherewith it hath plea&s;ed <HI>God</HI> to enlighten your Under|&s;tanding, rectifie what&s;oever is ami&s;s in your Affections. Di&s;charge your &s;elf of the Duties that are in&s;eparably joyned to your Knowledge of <HI>God;</HI> that is, to fear,
<PB N="24" REF="20">to <HI>love,</HI> and to <HI>&s;erve him.</HI> I do not que|&s;tion but you would have done this tho I had not exhorted you to it; which will be a matter of great Comfort in my Sor|row for your Ab&s;ence. <HI>&V;pon this Belief</HI> I abridg'd my Thoughts, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed much of what I could have &s;aid upon this Subject, which being &s;o abundant, would have render'd this Di&s;cour&s;e at lea&s;t as long as both tho&s;e which are to follow.</P>
<P>To being with our &s;econd Subject, which is, concerning your <HI>Duty to your &s;elf,</HI> I think it very convenient to put you in mind of that moral Dialogue which in your tender Years I made for your In&s;tru|ctions; wherein you may have remem|ber'd that I treated of <HI>Chri&s;tian Vertues,</HI> which are, <HI>Faith, Charity,</HI> and <HI>Hope;</HI> which three, guide us in our <HI>Duty to God: Faith</HI> makes us &s;ubmit to him in <HI>all Things, Charity</HI> makes us cleave to him at <HI>all Times,</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> carrieth us to him to <HI>all Eternity.</HI> You ought al&s;o to re|member that there are <HI>Moral Vertues; viz: Prudence, Fortiude, Temperance,</HI> and <HI>Justice:</HI> The&s;e are to teach us our <HI>Duty to our &s;elves,</HI> as al&s;o our Duty <HI>to our Neigh|bours.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e four Vertues is
<PB N="25" REF="20">like a Salt to &s;ea&s;on the other three: <HI>For|titude</HI> and <HI>Temperance</HI> have a relation to each individual Per&s;on; and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is the Bonds of Humane Society, without which Men mu&s;t live together like Wolves, not being capable of any Con|ver&s;e for the Publick Good, which, next to the glorifying of <HI>God,</HI> ought to be our chief Aim: So that in this &s;econd Arti|cle of In&s;tructions which, <HI>my Son,</HI> I do now lay down before you, I mu&s;t &s;peak but of the three fir&s;t Vertues; <HI>Prudence, Temperance,</HI> and <HI>Fortitude. Prudence</HI> ought to be the Rule of your <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Con|duct. Temperance</HI> will in&s;truct you how to govern your &s;elf in <HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> that you may not be poi&s;oned with it's delicious Plea&s;ures: And <HI>Fortitude</HI> will &s;o guide you, that you &s;hall not be overcome with the Bitterne&s;s of <HI>Adver&s;ity.</HI> I will reduce all I have to &s;ay to you to as few words as I can (altho the Subject be very copious) that you may only receive the Pith and Juyce of it, whereby you may be nou|ri&s;hed without being overcharged.</P>
<P>Man was born for Society, and I may &s;ay, without that Society Vertue would
<PB N="26" REF="21">have no Followers, Man's Life would be unplea&s;ant, and in this World there would be no Content. <HI>God,</HI> after he had created Man, &s;aid <HI>it was not good that he &s;hould be alone:</HI> Therefore through his extraordinary Goodne&s;s, <HI>he made him a Help meet for him,</HI> and formed a Per&s;on with whom he might live in Society. Now this Society is nothing el&s;e but a reciprocal Communication made be|tween divers Per&s;ons, who by mutual Services to one another endeavour to ren|der their Lives as plea&s;ant as they can, and to avoid vexatious Cares and Sor|row. According to the Humor of the Per&s;ons which make up this Society, it will be good or evil; for, as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;aith, <HI>He that walketh with wi&s;e men &s;hall be wi&s;e; but a Companion of Fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</HI> Evil Communication corrupts good Manners; therefore, <HI>my Son,</HI> you ought diligently to take heed in the choice of tho&s;e Per&s;ons with whom you de&s;ign to be acquainted. Hearken not to <HI>Nature</HI> herein, who (following her In|clination to what is evil) might lead you into bad Company; be rather attentive to <HI>true Piety,</HI> which will tell you, <HI>Enter
<PB N="27" REF="21">not into the Path of the Wicked, and go not in the way of evil Men.</HI> Con&s;ult Prudence, and &s;he will teach you to choo&s;e your Friends, which is a thing of the highe&s;t con&s;equence; becau&s;e we acquire gene|rally the <HI>Habits</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of tho&s;e whom we frequent: This was &s;o well known to our Fore-fathers, that they did not &s;cruple to pa&s;s their Judgment upon any Man when they were once acquaint|ed with the Temper of his Companions; according to this old Saying of theirs, <HI>Tell me what Company you keep and I will tell you what you are.</HI> Frequent then, <HI>my Son,</HI> as much as you are able, Per&s;ons of Honour and Integrity, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e who are <HI>e&s;teemed</HI> &s;uch; and out of this Company choo&s;e one of the mo&s;t vertu|ous whom you mu&s;t endeavour to make your particular Friend. Let not this &s;in|gle Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>one Friend</HI> &s;urpri&s;e you, for it is not an ea&s;ie matter to obtain ma|ny <HI>true Friends;</HI> nay, I take a <HI>true Friend</HI> to be a thing almo&s;t as rare in Humane Society, as the Philo&s;ophers Stone is in Chymi&s;try. Several People have made it their bu&s;ine&s;s all their Life-time to find a <HI>true Friend,</HI> and yet at la&s;t have mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="28" REF="22">their Aim. U&s;e your utmo&s;t Endeavours to procure one; you will be happy if you can bring it to pa&s;s: Do not &s;pare Com|plai&s;ance, Re&s;pect, or any Service, pro|vided you do not de&s;cend to what is low and infamous; which cannot be, if you choo&s;e a vertuous Per&s;on, as I have pre|&s;cribed you, to bind your &s;elf with, in a tender, &s;incere, and &s;trict Friend&s;hip. Kindne&s;s mu&s;t be repayed with Kindne&s;s: If you would be beloved, love. It is mo&s;t certain, that a Corre&s;pondence of Humours contributs extremely to our being beloved; therefore if you <HI>de&s;ire</HI> the Friend&s;hip of a Man of Honour and Vertue, <HI>imitate</HI> his Vertue and that will facilitate your De&s;ire. When you have acquired this Friend&s;hip, be careful to avoid what&s;oever may occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of it. Be before hand with him if you can, in Services, and in kind Re&s;pects towards him: If you have convincing Proofs that he hath given you his Heart, and if you have likewi&s;e yielded yours up to him, with-hold not your Pur&s;e from him in his Nece&s;&s;ity. If unhappily your Friend&s;hip upon any occa&s;ion &s;hould wax cold, and that out of Prudence you
<PB N="29" REF="22">mu&s;t part with him, let it not be a &s;ud|den Rupture, but retire by degrees. There is &s;carce any thing &s;o ju&s;t and fre|quent an Ob&s;tacle to the procuring or pre&s;erving of Friend&s;hip, as <HI>Pride:</HI> This Sin was the cau&s;e that the <HI>fir&s;t Angels</HI> were transferred from Heaven to Hell, and became the <HI>first Devils.</HI> Take great care not to be tainted with it; and if you ex|pect the Love of tho&s;e with whom you keep Company, be humble towards all. <HI>When Pride cometh then cometh Shame: but with the Lowly is Wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;aith the Wi&s;e Man: <HI>God &s;corneth the Scorners; but he giveth Grace unto the Lowly. Every one that is proud in Heart is an Abomination to the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Proud</HI> have this misfortune to di&s;plea&s;e every Body but them&s;elves. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that a vain Man &s;hould love to be blamed, and 'tis almo&s;t as impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to be a Rea&s;onable Creature while he hateth Reproof. <HI>So|lomon</HI> a&s;&s;ures us of it, in &s;aying, <HI>Who&s;o lo|veth In&s;truction loveth Knowledge: but he that hateth Reproof is bruti&s;h. Poverty and Shame &s;hall be to him that refu&s;eth In&s;tru|ction; but he that regardeth Reproof &s;hall be honoured.</HI> If you de&s;ire to be re&s;pected
<PB N="30" REF="23">make your &s;elf worthy of Re&s;pect; this mu&s;t be done not only by &s;hunning <HI>Pride;</HI> avoid al&s;o <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Gluttony, Sloth, &V;ncleanne&s;s, Anger,</HI> and <HI>Envy;</HI> the&s;e are the Vices again&s;t which all the World cries out, and which neverthele&s;s reign in all Parts of the World. In the &s;ame Order as they are mentioned I will lay down their re&s;pective Rea&s;ons which &s;hould provoke your Hatred of them.</P>
<P><HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is the Root of all Evil, and as St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Timothy,</HI> it cau&s;eth Men to <HI>err from the Faith.</HI> It makes them fall into Temptation, into the Snares of the Devil, and into &s;everal inordinate and un&s;atiable De&s;ires, which at length plunge them into the Aby&s;s of Damnation. Our ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle did not re&s;t &s;atisfied with this dreadful De&s;cription, but in his Epi|&s;tle to the <HI>Colo&s;&s;ians</HI> calleth it Idolatry; becau&s;e it cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s any Heart with|out fir&s;t expelling from thence all <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and &s;etting up in the Room the <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>World</HI> and of <HI>Riches.

<PB N="31" REF="23" MS="y">takes all opportunities to heap up Riches; and tho the means are mo&s;t unlawful, yet to her they always &s;eem commendable enough: I &s;ay, her De&s;ign is to lay up Riches; for the <HI>covetous</HI> Man takes good heed not to make any <HI>u&s;e</HI> of them.

<P>Before I proceed to &s;peak of the other Vices, (who&s;e Deformities I purpo&s;e to di&s;cover to you to &s;tir up your di&s;like of them) I mu&s;t put you in mind, that how great &s;oever is Mans Inclination to Evil, yet he endeavours to hide that Vice to which he is inclined, under the Mask of &s;ome Vertue that has a re&s;emblance with it. This Example &s;hall &s;erve for all the re&s;t. The <HI>Covetous,</HI> tho he be deeply en|gaged in that &s;ordid Pa&s;&s;ion, cannot but acknowledge the Vilene&s;s of it, yet in him&s;elf he makes it pa&s;s for an <HI>honest Thriftine&s;s;</HI> this he fir&s;t per&s;uades <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to believe, and then <HI>his Neighbours.</HI> All
<PB N="32" REF="24">that are much tainted with any Vice, fol|low the &s;ame Rule for their Ju&s;tification: Of this, <HI>my Son,</HI> I have given you no|tice, that you may avoid the falling in|to &s;o unrea&s;onable a Conduct; and that &s;o you may not be reduced to cover a <HI>vici|ous Inclination</HI> with the Veil of what is <HI>tru|ly Vertuous.</HI></P>
<P>After having given you this Advice, (which I thought expedient to be done) I &s;hall &s;peak of <HI>Gluttony,</HI> as it follows next in cour&s;e after <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The&s;e two in their <HI>Means</HI> are &s;omething contrary, but their <HI>Effects</HI> do re&s;emble much. The <HI>Covetous</HI> picks up all things to increa&s;e <HI>Riches</HI> that are pernicious to him; and the <HI>Glutton</HI> lets all fly to procure tho&s;e <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> which mu&s;t be prejudicial to his Happine&s;s. The fir&s;t, to content his <HI>raking De&s;ire,</HI> will ab&s;tain from what is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> and the other, to &s;atisfie his <HI>Sen&s;ual Appetite,</HI> will not ab&s;tain from what is <HI>&s;uperfluous.</HI> One <HI>locks up</HI> his Rea&s;on in his Che&s;t with his Gold and Silver; and t'other <HI>drowns</HI> it in Wine and Dainties. What can be hoped from &s;uch a Man? <HI>God</HI> ordained us to eat that we might live, and the <HI>Glutton</HI> ima|gines
<PB N="33" REF="24">that he lives only to eat; whereof he is &s;o fully per&s;uaded, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible for him to apply him&s;elf with plea|&s;ure to any Duty which is requi&s;ite in a civil Society; nay, how can he do it with Plea&s;ure, he that knoweth no other Plea&s;ure than that of the <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Kitchen</HI> is his <HI>Church,</HI> and who of his <HI>Belly</HI> makes his <HI>God.</HI> Avoid then this Sin, who&s;e Effects are &s;o pernicious; and in following my Coun&s;el you will obey the Command of the Holy Scripture, <HI>viz. Be not among&s;t Wine-bibbers, among&s;t rio|tous eaters of Fle&s;h: For the Drunkard and the Glutton &s;hall come to Poverty; and drow&s;i|ne&s;s &s;hall clothe a Man with Rags.</HI> The Spirit of <HI>God</HI> joyns <HI>Sleep</HI> with <HI>Gluttony,</HI> to &s;hew us, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be a <HI>Glutton</HI> without being <HI>&s;lothful.</HI> The hea|vine&s;s of Meats communicates it &s;elf to the Stomach, and the heavine&s;s of the Stomach reacheth the very Brain: No wonder then that by the&s;e &s;everal <HI>hea|vine&s;&s;es</HI> the Soul becomes heavy, and le&s;s apt to perform the Functions to which &s;he is de&s;igned. The <HI>Slothful Per&s;on</HI> has but ju&s;t the Sen&s;e and Motion of a Man; and of that he hath &s;o little, that there
<PB N="34" REF="25">is not much difference between him and a Statue. This never &s;tirs but when he is carried; and he never acts without being &s;purred forwards. The &s;lowne&s;s of all his Actions both Spiritual and Cor|poreal, is a &s;ort of <HI>Lethargy</HI> both of <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> whereof he would not be cu|red tho it might be done, becau&s;e his delight is in a &s;lothful Ea&s;e; and the thoughts of a moderate Labour, which is a plea&s;ure to others, to him is a tor|ment. St. <HI>Paul</HI> may cry out long enough to him, that <HI>he who will not work mu&s;t not eat:</HI> there mu&s;t be &s;omething more ri|gorous than the bare Exhortation of the Apo&s;tle; for Nece&s;&s;ity it &s;elf (tho a thing &s;o prevailing) can &s;carce rou&s;e him out of that Idlene&s;s, who&s;e &s;weets are more &s;en&s;ible to him than all the Advantages that might accrue from an hone&s;t Employment. He doth not act with more Zeal for his Intere&s;t in Hea|ven than for that upon Earth; whereby you may judge, that if he is <HI>not a good Citizen,</HI> he is as <HI>ill a Chri&s;tian;</HI> and you may believe that as the <HI>Glutton</HI> has not made <HI>Temperance</HI> a guide to his Actions, &s;o neither has the <HI>Sluggard</HI> con&s;ulted

<P>I would have you ob&s;erve, <HI>my Son,</HI> that from the&s;e two la&s;t Vices <HI>&V;nclean|ne&s;s</HI> proceeds, as I intimated to you above: 'Tis begot by <HI>Gluttony,</HI> and hatched by <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI> It will not &s;eem &s;trange to you that &s;uch <HI>evil Parents</HI> engender &s;o <HI>wicked</HI> a <HI>Child.</HI> It has it's Inclination from the Authors of its Birth, and even improves their noxious Qualities; for this Vice alone procures us more mi&s;chief than both the others together. In <HI>Gluttony</HI> and <HI>Sloth,</HI> our Bodies &s;uffer <HI>before</HI> our Minds; but <HI>&V;ncleanne&s;s</HI> &s;ei&s;es and prevails upon our Minds <HI>before</HI> it &s;ubdues our Bodies; and having made it &s;elf Ma&s;ter of that which
<PB N="37" REF="26">was given for our Guide, it hurrieth us along to di&s;hone&s;t, and &s;hameful De&s;ires, by a Tyranny both ab&s;olute and inevita|ble, altho in the fulfilling of tho&s;e De&s;ires we meet our utter De&s;truction. This Ene|my is &s;o much the more dangerous, &s;ee|ing that the <HI>means</HI> wherewith it u&s;eth to de&s;troy us are <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Delight,</HI> which lead us a&s;ide from Vertue, and &s;trangle us in their Embraces. By their Cunning they &s;educe us; they charm us with their Complai&s;ance; and &s;o &s;traight|ly engage us to them, that of our &s;elves 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould break the Chains wherewith they fa&s;ten us. They are &s;o many <HI>Dalila's</HI> who lull us a&s;leep, that they may fir&s;t deprive us of our Strength, and then tumble us into the bottomle&s;s Pit of all Vices. They draw us and en|tice us to our everla&s;ting Ruin, if we do not prevent them by a &s;erious Repen|tance, which if too late, might be in vain. Shun then &s;uch Guides under who&s;e Conduct the Event will be &s;o un|happy. Fly from <HI>them</HI> with more &s;peed than you would from <HI>Robbers</HI> on the High-way; for the&s;e will be contented with your <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Clothes,</HI> but the
<PB N="38" REF="27">others aim directly at your <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Bo|dy. My Son,</HI> you may ob&s;erve the&s;e Di|rections with much more ea&s;e, if you do but con&s;ider, that all Plea&s;ures taking advantage of our weakne&s;s, fa&s;ten us to them with a promi&s;e of the &s;weete&s;t Satis|factions, which at la&s;t prove to be but bitter Sorrows. In this they are like <HI>La|ban,</HI> who perceiving <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Affection, engaged him to &s;erve &s;even Years for <HI>beautiful Rachel,</HI> and when that term was expired gave him only <HI>ill-favoured Leah.</HI> The&s;e Directions, I &s;ay, you may more ea&s;ily follow, if you will diligently ob&s;erve how filthy, ba&s;e, and infamous are the&s;e very Plea&s;ures which our <HI>&V;n|cleanne&s;s</HI> makes u&s;e of to &s;educe us; how &s;oon they pa&s;s away; what Mi&s;chiefs at|tend them; and la&s;tly, the Pains we mu&s;t undergo <HI>to all Eternity,</HI> for tho&s;e Plea|&s;ures that la&s;ted but <HI>one Hour,</HI> or perhaps but <HI>one Moment. Temperance</HI> will make you avoid the&s;e Dangers, if you take its Advice, and after that it has demon&s;tra|ted to you that whil&s;t <HI>they command you</HI> they are full of danger; it will make you al&s;o confe&s;s that they are innocent and harmle&s;s when <HI>you can command them,</HI> and
<PB N="39" REF="27">purge them from the Venom they con|tracted with the Impurity of their Birth; for having taken away all the Means whereby they might be hurtful to us, we may make them to be &s;erviceable again&s;t their own Nature, to our hone&s;t and lawful Recreations.</P>
<P>There remains yet behind, <HI>my Son,</HI> the two Sins of <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Envy.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;ts a man into the greate&s;t exce&s;s of Di&s;order. It drives from our Minds all manner of Rea&s;on; and as &s;oon as ever it &s;eizeth the Heart, it filleth it with Motions &s;o violent and tempe|&s;tuous, that it is very fitly termed a <HI>&s;hort Madne&s;s.</HI> Fury and Bruti&s;hne&s;s are the two chief Branches that &s;pring from it: And I think you need but behold the Actions of a Man enflamed with Anger to acknowledge this Truth; they are &s;o many irrefragable Proofs of it; for if his Words did not &s;peak him a Man, there's no Body but would take him for &s;ome fierce Wild Bea&s;t. His Soul which is to&s;|&s;ed to and fro with tho&s;e violent and un|ruly Motions, doth expre&s;s her Agitation &s;o plain in the Features and Lineaments
<PB N="40" REF="28">of his Countenance, that it is no hard matter to know by the&s;e <HI>outward Chara|cters</HI> what vexatious Di&s;orders he under|goes <HI>within.</HI> By &s;uch innocent Means as the&s;e, a Learned Man in our time found what he had vainly &s;earched after in all the Secrets of Philo&s;ophy; the way to di|mini&s;h the Inclination which one of his Di&s;ciples had towards this Vice, in who&s;e vertuous Education he was very much concerned. He &s;hewed him in the Coun|tenance of a Man agitated with this Pa&s;|&s;ion &s;o great a change, and &s;o va&s;tly dif|ferent from what it was wont to be, that from the <HI>Effects</HI> running up to the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> it was not difficult for him to make him under&s;tand that a <HI>Stream &s;o infected</HI> mu&s;t needs proceed from a <HI>poi&s;on'd Spring;</HI> whereby he brought him to be &s;o aver&s;e from this Vice, that it even dimini&s;hed extremely the Inclination he had towards it. The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> did heretofore u&s;e the like device to make Drunken|ne&s;s odious to their Children: They made their Slaves drink to Exce&s;s, and then they were brought before them in that Condition, who &s;eeing them reel and &s;tagger, and act like Men depriv'd
<PB N="41" REF="28">of their Sen&s;es, conceived &s;o great a ha|tred for this loath&s;om Vice, that they would never after be reconciled to it. Do you, <HI>my Son,</HI> take the &s;ame Method to oppo&s;e and conquer that Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger, which is a &s;ort of Drunkenne&s;s that a&s;&s;aults our Under&s;tanding and clouds our Rea&s;on with Fumes more dan|gerous than tho&s;e of Wine, becau&s;e they are of a longer continuance, and they produce more direful Effects. In a word, to give you an ea&s;ie and infallible Re|medy again&s;t Anger, tho you have ne|ver &s;o great Provocations thereto; pra|cti&s;e the Advice of a great Per&s;on of this latter Age, who exhorts us to yield betimes <HI>to Rea&s;on,</HI> that which in a little while we cannot but yield <HI>to Time.</HI> To this whol&s;om Advice add <HI>Fortitude,</HI> that Heroick Vertue, and the &s;upport of the re&s;t, whereof <HI>Prudence</HI> is the Guide, and it will not be difficult for you to &s;ucced.</P>
<P><HI>Envy</HI> is the la&s;t Vice I have to mention, who&s;e Picture I am going to draw. Of all Vices 'tis the mo&s;t rampant. It inci|ted Man to a Crime which being direct|ed immediately again&s;t <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="29">made him fail in his Duty <HI>to one</HI> and <HI>t'other;</HI> and in one Act made him com|mit Sacrilege and Murder, by &s;tirring up <HI>Cain</HI> to deface the Image of <HI>God</HI> in the Per&s;on of his Brother whom he killed. 'Tis a Pa&s;&s;ion which after having poi&s;on'd the Mind, &s;preads al&s;o it's Poi&s;on all over the Body; which corrupts the whole Ma&s;s of Blood, and ca&s;teth its Venome through all the Veins; which renders the Countenance <HI>meager, gha&s;tly, hideous,</HI> and which notwith&s;tanding all Endeavours to lye hid, doth manife&s;tly expo&s;e it &s;elf by disfiguring that Per&s;on whom it po&s;&s;e&s;s|eth: And we may very ju&s;tly &s;ay, that if <HI>Anger</HI> is a Fire which enflames us, <HI>En|vy</HI> is one that dries us up, and carrieth along with it the Puni&s;hment of the <HI>En|vious,</HI> &s;eeing that neither Night nor Day doth it &s;uffer him to take any Re&s;t. 'Tis like a Hecktick Fever which con&s;umes a Mans Body by degrees, and which is dif|ficult to drive away, when through Neg|ligence one has &s;uffer'd it to take Root. The <HI>Envious</HI> Man &s;trikes directly at <HI>God.</HI> He derives his greate&s;t Mi&s;ery from the ju&s;t di&s;tribution <HI>God</HI> makes of his Bene|fits to other men. Another's Calamity is
<PB N="43" REF="29">his Joy. The good Health of his Neigh|bour dimini&s;heth his own, and his Neigh|bour falling &s;ick makes him well again. His Draughts are then <HI>&s;weetest</HI> when mingled with the <HI>bitter Tears</HI> of his Neighbour. His private Sorrows ari&s;e from the Satisfaction and Content of the Publick. He looks upon that Gain or Profit that doth not help fill up <HI>his</HI> Bags, to be a great lo&s;s to <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> and he is never happy but in the mi&s;ery of tho&s;e of his Acquaintance. The moderate Har|ve&s;t of another makes his own unaccepta|ble, tho it be abundant; and the greate&s;t Pro&s;perity in this World would be un|welcome to him, if he were forced to &s;hare &s;ome part of it with his Neighbours. You may ea&s;ily perceive, <HI>my Son,</HI> that a Man of this Temper can have Peace with no body, and that generally he mu&s;t be at War with <HI>God:</HI> judge thereby of the Tranquility of his Body and Soul. Others comprehend their Unhappine&s;s within their own Calamities; but the Envious, be&s;ides their own peculiar Mis|fortunes, procure to them&s;elves an infinite number from the good Fortune of others. Shun therefore this Vice which is &s;o per|nicious
<PB N="44" REF="30">and dete&s;table, that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for any one to be guilty of it without becoming both a Puni&s;hment to him&s;elf and his own Executioner. And be a&s;&s;u|red, that after it has furiou&s;ly tormented in this Life tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it, in the next it will lead them into that Place which <HI>Divine Ju&s;tice</HI> has &s;et apart for all tho&s;e who have not a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive regard to what&s;oever is ordained by <HI>Pro|vidence.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;cription I have made to you of the&s;e Vices has been &s;omething longer than I &s;hould have imagined. <HI>God</HI> grant the Style may be not only &s;o clear as to excite in you that Hatred which you ought to have again&s;t them, but al&s;o &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive as to encourage you in the Love and Practice of their oppo&s;ite Ver|tues. There is not any thing can be throughly known until it be compared with its contrary; if therefore you have apprehended the Rea&s;ons which &s;hould move you to hate <HI>Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Gluttony, Sloth, &V;ncleanne&s;s, Anger,</HI> and <HI>Envy;</HI> you will ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded for the Welfare of your Soul and Body, to
<PB N="45" REF="30">love <HI>Humility, a liberal Frugality, Sobrie|ty, Diligence, Cha&s;tity, Moderation,</HI> and <HI>Charity;</HI> and to po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e Vertues you mu&s;t take <HI>your Mea&s;ures</HI> from the Dictates of <HI>Prudence, Fortitude,</HI> and <HI>Temperance,</HI> who&s;e Coun&s;els cannot but be advanta|geous to you, if you will thereunto ac|quie&s;ce. Among all the Benefits that you may receive from the&s;e Vertues, I would to <HI>God, my Son,</HI> they would in&s;pire you with as much Love for <HI>Truth,</HI> as young People have Inclination for <HI>Lying.</HI> Have in Horror this Vice; and to do this ea&s;ily, remember that JESUS CHRIST took upon him this Quality of <HI>True,</HI> on|ly to &s;ignifie to us that he loved tho&s;e who loved the <HI>Truth:</HI> And why (think you) is the <HI>Devil</HI> termed in the Scripture <HI>the Father of Lies,</HI> unle&s;s it be to &s;hew that <HI>all Lyars</HI> are his Children? The love of this Vice is an undeniable Character upon all tho&s;e who practi&s;e it through In|clination, (and from this Inclination ac|quire a Habit) that they are the Children of the <HI>Devil.</HI> I know very well that they who are willing to excu&s;e it, &s;ay, that a &s;ecret Shame which they have, to ac|knowledge them&s;elves guilty of the Fault
<PB N="46" REF="31">imputed to them, doth not &s;eldom drive them again&s;t their Will into a Nece&s;&s;ity of Lying. It is an <HI>ill Pre&s;ident</HI> that <HI>Adam</HI> hath left to his Po&s;terity: But what &s;ignifie all the&s;e Prevarications wherewith we di&s;|&s;emble the Truth? They are but like <HI>&s;o many Fig-leaves</HI> through which the Truth <HI>will</HI> be di&s;cerned in &s;pight of all our Endeavours to the contrary. The Hopes of a more regular Conduct hereaf|ter doth &s;omewhat comfort tho&s;e who are concerned for their pre&s;ent Indi&s;cretion; but daily Experience teacheth us, that when a Man has committed a Fault, and that he endeavours to evade it with a Lye, he is le&s;s &s;orry for <HI>being guilty</HI> than for <HI>being &s;o reputed.</HI> I do not pretend, <HI>my Son,</HI> by exhorting you never to lye, to publi&s;h and declare whatever you know to be true; this in <HI>many</HI> Ca&s;es would be a great Imprudence; yet Lying is a Crime in <HI>all:</HI> the be&s;t way to avoid it is to &s;peak little and live well. A Man needs not u&s;e Di&s;&s;imulation if his Conduct is good; and he is always &s;incere in his Di&s;cour&s;e that con&s;iders fir&s;t what he is about to &s;ay, and then con&s;ults <HI>Prudence,</HI> the Definition whereof will convince you
<PB N="47" REF="31">of it. 'Tis a Habit of the Under&s;tanding which pre&s;cribes to our De&s;ires, means both hone&s;t and convenient to attain a favourable and happy End. You may ea&s;ily perceive then, that how profitable &s;oever are the Ends you propo&s;e to your &s;elf in your Undertakings, the means cannot be honourable if you make u&s;e of Deceit and Lying to compa&s;s them. Your Hatred towards this Vice will not only cau&s;e you to be more re&s;erved in your Speech, it will render you al&s;o more cir|cum&s;pect in all your Actions, and (by grafting Sincerity in your Heart) will make you abhor Detraction and Ca|lumny, two general Plagues, whence &s;pring mo&s;t of our Troubles, they being often the Cau&s;e of our Quarrels. Since|rity is always attended with Probity; and one and t'other are as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry in <HI>Pious Duties,</HI> as in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> of <HI>Society.</HI> You cannot be a good Chri&s;tian without being an hone&s;t Man, neither can you be an hone&s;t Man if you are deceitful. Di&s;&s;imulation is a <HI>Sacrilege in Religion,</HI> and Lying is almo&s;t as great a <HI>Crime in Conver&s;ation.</HI></P>

Moreover, let the means, whereby you intend to obtain your Ends, be mo&s;t hone&s;t and ju&s;t: yet how ju&s;t &s;oever tho&s;e means are, and how exact your Knowledge in what you undertake, begin nothing till you have begged God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon your Enter|prizes; your Cares and Indu&s;try, tho ne|ver &s;o great, would be needle&s;s, and per|haps a hinderance to your Affairs, if this Ble&s;&s;ing did not intervene and render them happy. If notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e <HI>Precautions,</HI> Providence is not plea&s;ed that the Succe&s;s &s;hould an&s;wer your De|&s;ires, fail not however to prai&s;e his Holy Name, and &s;ubmit to his Will with a re|&s;pectful and implicite Faith; a&s;&s;uring your &s;elf that it had <HI>not</HI> &s;o happened, if <HI>other|wi&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="32">it might have been better for <HI>his</HI> Glory, or <HI>your</HI> Salvation.</P>
<P>Take hold, with a <HI>judicious</HI> eagerne&s;s, of all favourable Opportunities which your Good Fortune offers you: They are rare now-a-days, and much &s;earched after; be careful that you let them not &s;lip when you meet any, le&s;t when they are gone, you follow after them to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Make good U&s;e of your Time, for what you lo&s;e thereof can never be re|covered. New Gains may over and above &s;upply old Lo&s;&s;es, but the Lo&s;s of Time is irrecoverable.</P>
<P>By exhorting you to apply your &s;elf to your Bu&s;ine&s;s, I do not mean that you &s;hould give up your &s;elf &s;o entirely to it, as to receive <HI>no Diver&s;ion.</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible that as the Body cannot long un|dergo Labour, &s;o neither can the Mind be engaged in a moderate Study, if a rea|&s;onable Relaxation of their Functions yield not to both of them the Means to repair the Strength and Spirits which they lo&s;t. For this Rea&s;on I &s;hall be &s;o far from <HI>forbidding</HI> you Recreations, that I advi&s;e you to u&s;e them, neverthele&s;s with this re|&s;traint,
<PB N="50" REF="33">to choo&s;e, as near as you can gue&s;s, &s;uch as are the mo&s;t hone&s;t and inno|cent. I take tho&s;e Diver&s;ions whereby the Body is moderately exerci&s;ed to be the more proper of the two for a Chri&s;tian and an Hone&s;t Man, than Gaming, which depends upon much Hazard. But as in this Ca&s;e, Choice depends upon Inclina|tion, you would do well to make yours (as much as you can) <HI>&s;ub&s;ervient to your Duty,</HI> which will put you in mind that, let the Game be what it will, you ought to be very careful in this Occa&s;ion, not to render Principal what &s;hould be but Acce&s;&s;ary. Let your Game therefore be a delightful Recreation, and not a vex|atious Trouble, &s;uch as might be occa&s;i|oned by a great Lo&s;s, if you hazard any con&s;iderable Sums. Never put it to the venture to quit that with a Grudge which you began for your Diver&s;ion; and this cannot be, if you play but for Play-&s;ake, that is, if you play but for a Small matter, and with the intent only to refre&s;h your Spirits, which an Exce&s;s of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Study had tryed: How|ever let the Sum be never &s;o incon&s;ide|rable for which you play, take heed it
<PB N="51" REF="33">be with &s;uch as you know, that they may not fir&s;t Cheat, and then Deride you.</P>
<P><HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> have po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed the World almo&s;t from the Creation: Avoid both with Care. Seek therefore <HI>my Son,</HI> to be in&s;tructed, and be not a&s;hamed to ask the Council of tho&s;e who know more than your &s;elf. Be al|ways mi&s;tru&s;tful of your own Parts, and never take it ill from tho&s;e who give you their Advice, but rather receive it with all imaginable Sweetne&s;s and Re&s;pect, <HI>re&s;erving only</HI> to your &s;elf the Freedom of following it, if you find it con&s;onat to <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>Love <HI>Reading;</HI> 'tis that which <HI>&s;trength|ens the Judgment, enriches the Memory,</HI> and <HI>enlightens</HI> every Day more and more the <HI>&V;nder&s;tanding.</HI> 'Tis that which will teach us to expre&s;s our &s;elves in a Style &s;ublime, tho both Smooth and Charming: &s;o that we may &s;ay, 'tis that alone procures us all the Advantages nece&s;&s;ary, either in Meditation or Con|ver&s;e. Yet do not read only to be ren|der'd more knowing, read chiefly to be|come
<PB N="52" REF="34">better; and to that End make choice of good Books, applying your &s;elf mo&s;t commonly to &s;uch as treat of <HI>Piety,</HI> in the reading whereof, &s;et before you the Example of the Bee, which ga|there the &s;weet Dew out of Flowers to make Honey in it's due Sea&s;on. Now to profit by this Example, ob&s;erve that when you read, (whether they be Books of <HI>Devotion, Morality</HI> or <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>) you do not neglect the reducing under Heads in a Common-place, the excellent Notes and Ob&s;ervations that you will collect: that will <HI>ea&s;e</HI> very much your Memory, and in many occa&s;ions will &s;ave you the trouble (which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e lie upon you) of &s;earching after Expre&s;&s;ions, where|of you may &s;tand in Need.</P>
<P>Do not imploy your Time in <HI>reading Romances:</HI> They only heat the Imagina|tion, and not nouri&s;h the Under&s;tand|ing; for altho they repre&s;ent Vertues in their highe&s;t Degree, neverthele&s;s there lies a great deal of <HI>Venome</HI> hid under tho&s;e lovely Flowers, e&s;pecially for young People. You will do well to let alone the Reading of &s;uch Books, which
<PB N="53" REF="34">are Snares &s;o much the more difficult to avoid, as being in <HI>appearence</HI> not dange|rous, tho in <HI>reality</HI> they are much.</P>
<P>Take &s;pecial heed, <HI>my Son,</HI> that the de&s;ire of Riches doth not force you up|on evil Means to obtain them, nor excite you to Actions Mercinary, Ba&s;e and Unju&s;t. <HI>&V;&s;e not divers Weights, and divers Mea&s;ures; both of them are alike Abomination to the Lord. Better is a little with Righteou&s;ne&s;s, then great Revenues without Right.</HI> And remember, that <HI>God|lyne&s;s with Contentment is great Gain.</HI></P>
<P>Shun <HI>Ambition,</HI> tho &s;ome only call it an Errour of great Minds. I always con|&s;ider'd it as proceeding from Minds vain and defective. 'Tis a Mon&s;ter mo&s;t un&s;a|tiable, who&s;e De&s;igns are without Limits as well as his Hopes, and how &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oever is the Ambitious in his Enter|prizes, the Succe&s;s doth rather puff up his De&s;ires than content them. His Ad|vancement to an eminent Employment which he expected, di&s;covers to him ano|ther more Eminent, without which his Happine&s;s &s;eems to be imperfect. As
<PB N="54" REF="35" MS="y">fa&s;t as his Honour and Grandure <HI>encrea|&s;es,</HI> his Hopes and Pretentions <HI>multiply:</HI> The whole World can &s;carce &s;atisfie him: Like <HI>Pompey,</HI> he will have no Equal, much le&s;s can he endure a Superiour. His Life pa&s;&s;eth in a perpetual Hurry of Body and Mind. Tranquility and Re|po&s;e are <HI>Terrae incognitae</HI> to him; and it often happens, that the Care he has been at to place him&s;elf &s;o high, &s;erves to ren|der his <HI>fall</HI> the more irrecoverable. Come not therefore near a Road &s;o dangerous, where in&s;tead of repo&s;ing your &s;elf you will find nothing but dreadful Precipices.</P>
<P>If any one &s;pread an ill Report of you, and that it comes to your knowledge, ex|amine it <HI>impartially;</HI> and if you find your &s;elf guilty of that which is imputed to you, mend, and be thankful to him who did you this good Office. If you are blamed wrongfully &s;hew no Anger or Di&s;plea&s;ure; for Experience makes it manife&s;t to us daily, that the <HI>Contempt</HI> of <HI>Calumny</HI> makes it die, whereas nothing but a Re&s;entment can keep it alive.</P>
<P>A learned Man of the&s;e Times &s;aid, that all Vertues were &s;wallowed up in Intere&s;t, like the Rivers in the Sea. Avoid, <HI>my Son,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="35">this <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Humor, which aiming &s;o much at our own Advantage, makes us forget what in Ju&s;tice is due to others. Accommodate your Intere&s;t to Rea&s;on, and to that Law of Nature, which was an ancient Maxim among Pagans; <HI>Do not to others, what you would not that they &s;hould do unto you;</HI> or rather to this Chri&s;tian Doctrine, <HI>do as you would be done by.</HI></P>
<P>Be careful not to take Exceptions; of a Trifle do not make a Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mo|ment, no more then of a Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mo|ment a Trifle. Labour to be in Peace with all Men; and rather relinqui&s;h &s;omething of your Right, than to enter into a Conte&s;t with any one. What ano|ther in this Ca&s;e would call, <HI>parting with his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;atiate the Greedine&s;s of his Neighbour,</HI> do you con&s;ider as an In|&s;trument to con&s;erve the Tranquility of your Mind, and the Repo&s;e of your Body, which you ought to e&s;teem be|yond all Wealth and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Never put off to a Future Time, that which you can do at the Pre&s;ent. Do every thing in Order, avoiding all Confu&s;ion, and let this Order be &s;een as
<PB N="56" REF="36">well in your Clothes, as in your Books; as well in your &s;malle&s;t Papers, as in your mo&s;t con&s;iderable Affairs.</P>
<P>Regulate your Expences by your E|&s;tate, and if that E&s;tate will permit, do not deny your &s;elf any thing that is Fitting, but have a Care you delight not in what is <HI>Superfluous,</HI> le&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly you become unable to provide for your &s;elf things ab&s;olutely <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>Altho the Nece&s;&s;ity of Clothing was one Con&s;equence of the fir&s;t Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> there are not a few Per&s;ons that make it one of the chief Subjects of their Vani|ty, and one of the mo&s;t painful Cares of their Life. <HI>Garments,</HI> which are only to pre&s;erve our Bodies from the injury of Weather, and which for this Rea&s;on ought to be ordain'd to no other U&s;e, are lea&s;t of all for that U&s;e among tho&s;e &s;ort of People: They have them to &s;ati&s;|fie their immoderate De&s;ires, as well as to &s;helter their Bodies from the Intempe|rance of the Sea&s;ons. This is a Weak|ne&s;s in either Sex, and 'tis <HI>Intolerable in both;</HI> however, 'tis <HI>much more</HI> to be con|demn'd in Men then in Women, be|cau&s;e mo&s;t Women making their Merit
<PB N="57" REF="36">con&s;i&s;t in an <HI>exteriour Comeline&s;s,</HI> you need not wonder if they &s;eek to make them&s;elves prized by the Magnificence of their Habits, and by the Beauty and Excellency of their Trimmings, where|as Men, who ought to be more rea&s;ona|ble, &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e (as below them) the&s;e vile &s;ordid Means to make them&s;elves be taken notice of; and only render them&s;elves con&s;iderable by <HI>Vertue,</HI> and their <HI>Excellent Qualifications.</HI> To this I mu&s;t exhort you with all earne&s;tne&s;s; however, in the Order you ob&s;erve for your Apparel, I would wi&s;h you to ad|vi&s;e with your own E&s;tate, to con&s;ider what is decent, and chiefly to have re|gard to what is mo&s;t rea&s;onable. If you do this your Habit will be always far|the&s;t from Extremes; you will be <HI>neat</HI> and not affected, <HI>well Clothed</HI> and not ex|travagant.</P>
<P>Be neither the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> nor the <HI>la&s;t</HI> in fol|lowing the <HI>Mode;</HI> too much Compli|ance with all Fa&s;hions is ridiculous, as on the other &s;ide too be always thwart|ing the Mode, is to be ob&s;tinate and Fanta&s;tical. Shun alike both the&s;e ex|tremes, and by ob&s;erving a Mean, let
<PB N="58" REF="37">People rather applaud your Mode&s;ty than condemn your Conceitedne&s;s. Be e&s;teem|ed <HI>rather</HI> for your per&s;onal Qualifications, than for your external Ornaments; in a Word, be <HI>more</HI> diligent in beautify|ing your <HI>Soul</HI> with good Qualities, than in adorning your <HI>Body</HI> with rich Ap|parel.</P>
<P>What&s;oever you &s;peak, or what&s;oever you write, let it be in Words few but comprehen&s;ive, &s;o that much may be contained in a little; yet not with&s;tand|ing you have free, &s;mooth, and graceful Expre&s;&s;ions in <HI>your</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e, let it be a Plea&s;ure to you when you are in Com|pany to hearken attentively to <HI>their</HI> Di&s;|cour&s;e, and to an&s;wer them appo&s;itely and to the purpo&s;e, that you may gain their good Will and Affection: There|fore remember this, that Conver&s;ation is not like a <HI>Monarchical Government,</HI> where <HI>one</HI> has only a right to &s;peak; but rather a kind of <HI>Democracy,</HI> where each Member has a Freedom of declaring their Minds in <HI>their turn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secrecy</HI> is the Soul of a De&s;ign, and not &s;eldom the &s;ole occa&s;ion of it's Succe&s;s: The more important are your De&s;igns,
<PB N="59" REF="37">the greater ought your Care to be in concealing them from others; yet if they are never &s;o incon&s;iderable, 'tis be&s;t to make no Body acquainted with them.

<P>Fly from <HI>Idlene&s;s;</HI> 'tis a &s;ort of <HI>Spiri|tual Lethargy,</HI> &s;o much the more dange|rous, as that the <HI>End</HI> of it is generally the <HI>Beginning</HI> of &s;ome Di&s;order. Man was created to be always acting; and of ne|ce&s;&s;ity he mu&s;t always be employed; therefore if his Actions are not good, they infallibly tend to Evil: And <HI>Idle|ne&s;s</HI> has this Re&s;emblance with <HI>Standing Waters,</HI> that if <HI>the&s;e</HI> breed Serpents <HI>t'other</HI> breeds Vices.</P>
<P>There are many People who are ex|treme eager to know what is done in <HI>their Neighbour's Hou&s;e,</HI> and at the &s;ame time are ignorant of mo&s;t things that happen in <HI>their own.</HI> This Curio&s;ity has always &s;eem'd to me to be pityful and ba&s;e, and unworthy of an hone&s;t Man: Therefore to avoid it, con&s;ider
<PB N="60" REF="38">with your &s;elf that he into who&s;e affairs you are prying is ether a <HI>Friend,</HI> or el&s;e is <HI>indifferent</HI> to you: If he is <HI>indifferent,</HI> what &s;atisfaction can you propo&s;e by knowing what he aims at?

<P>It belongs only to Kings to &s;ay that he who cannot di&s;&s;emble knows not how to reign. <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> tho <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> a Vertue in a <HI>Soverain Prince,</HI> is <HI>always</HI> a Vice in the <HI>Subject.</HI> Yet there are &s;ome Ca&s;es wherein it is a part of Prudence not to publi&s;h and make known all we think.

<PB N="61" REF="38">are not the mo&s;t worthy becau&s;e they are the be&s;t clothed, nor are the mo&s;t Vertuous always the mo&s;t eloquent: Therefore, <HI>my Son,</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e let not your Mind be anticipated; let your Judgment decide nothing <HI>without</HI> your Knowledge, and be &s;ure you <HI>Penetrate beyond</HI> the outward Parts of a Man be|fore you judge well or ill of him.</P>
<P>Flattery is the &s;ame to the <HI>Mind</HI> as <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> is to the <HI>Body,</HI> with this only diffe|rence, that all People <HI>hate</HI> Poi&s;on, yet they all <HI>love</HI> Flattery. The pa&s;&s;ionate Love that every one bears toward it, is a &s;ort of Lepro&s;ie which has infected all the Earth. You &s;hall find it in Shepherds poor Cot|tages as well as in the Palaces of Kings. 'Tis true it reigns among <HI>Kings and Prin|ces</HI> with more O&s;tentation then among <HI>the People,</HI> which produceth Events &s;o much the more pernicious, according to the Power of that Per&s;on whom it affects. Pro&s;perity is the Mother of Flattery as <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> is the &s;ole Object of Flatterers; and for this Rea&s;on alone there are more in the Courts of Princes than among pri|vate Families, who yet are not wholly exempt, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all Men

<P>I am now, <HI>my Son,</HI> come to an Article <HI>delicate, important,</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> to han|dle, which I would not willingly omit, that it might not be &s;aid I had pa&s;&s;ed over in Silence any thing that could con|tribute to your In&s;truction. 'Tis then concerning, how you mu&s;t carry your
<PB N="63" REF="39">&s;elf, if in unlucky and unexpected diffe|rences you are obliger to declare your &s;elf of any Party. If I went about to treat of this one Point to it's greate&s;t Ex|tent, it would require a Volume much larger than the whole Treati&s;e I de&s;ign for you, which is <HI>contrary</HI> to the Purpo&s;e I intended, of rendring you <HI>rather</HI> an Hone&s;t than a Learned Man. 'Tis enough for you to ob&s;erve the&s;e two or three Rules which I am going to give you. The Differences of this Nature are either <HI>publick</HI> or <HI>private;</HI> of which &s;ort &s;oever they are, 'tis be&s;t for you not to meddle if you can choo&s;e, unle&s;s you &s;ee apparently that you can be <HI>&s;o happy</HI> as to contribute towards a Re-union. But if you cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand Neuter, and that an unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity obligeth you to &s;ide with a Party; in that Ca&s;e I earne&s;tly exhort you to take this Coun|&s;el I now give you. If the Bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion be publick, and that the <HI>Prince</HI>'s <HI>Interest</HI> is concerned, adhere immediate|ly without any manner of Scruple to <HI>his</HI> Party. You pre&s;erve <HI>God's Right</HI> in de|fending the lawful Authority of Kings, who are <HI>his Vicegerents;</HI> and the <HI>Holy
<PB N="64" REF="40">Ghost</HI> has &s;o interwoven the Intere&s;ts of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> that reign with the Intere&s;ts <HI>of him</HI> by whom they reign, that he &s;aith, <HI>Who|&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth Power re&s;i&s;teth God.</HI> It is far better <HI>to dye</HI> for your Prince, than by u&s;urping <HI>to reign</HI> in his Place. In this Ca&s;e fail not to follow <HI>your Duty,</HI> without reflecting in the lea&s;t upon what would be mo&s;t for <HI>your Advantage;</HI> and <HI>venture all</HI> that you have in the World, if there is any Probability that it will produce advantageous Effects for the <HI>Royal Inte|rest.</HI> But if on the other &s;ide it is only a private Grudge or Animo&s;ity between &s;ome few; before you declare your &s;elf for either Party, con&s;ider impartially who&s;e Cau&s;e is mo&s;t ju&s;t: which you may ea&s;ily perceive; for without any doubt the Right is on their Side with whom the greate&s;t Number of Per&s;ons of Ho|nour, Integrity, and Di&s;cretion take part. E&s;pou&s;e therefore that Cau&s;e: neverthe|le&s;s keep within the Bounds of Moderati|on, and be not too forward in meddling with their Affairs, e&s;pecially when they proceed to Heat and Violence, and have no Hand in any Di&s;orders or injurious Attempts, which they might po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="65" REF="40">commit: But rather labour all you can to mollifie tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate and turbulent Spirits, to allay their Heats, and to re|duce them to &s;uch a Temper of Mind as might prevent the evil Con&s;equences which would infallibly follow from their Di&s;-union with the oppo&s;ite Party. I am &s;en&s;ible that neither your Birth nor Me|rit can make a Party any whit the more con&s;iderable, but as Accidents may oc|cur wherein we &s;hall be con&s;trained (of what Quality &s;oever we are) to declare our Intentions tho never &s;o much again&s;t our Will: I thought in &s;uch a Rencoun|ter the&s;e In&s;tructions would be not a lit|tle nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>Be di&s;creet and &s;incere in all your Words, hone&s;t and prudent in all your Actions, obliging and affable in all your Behaviour. Never con&s;true ill what others &s;ay or do, unle&s;s they come to be publickly &s;o cen&s;ur'd.</P>

<P>If you intend my Satisfaction, or your own Quiet, be careful never to become Surety for any Man, for any Cau&s;e what|&s;oever.

<P>Perhaps this may &s;eem &s;omewhat &s;trange and hard to many Men; yet it is drawn from the Advice of a Great King, who was the wi&s;e&s;t Man in the World, 22 Chap. of Prov. <HI>Be not thou one of them that &s;trike Hands, or of them that are Sureties for Debts: If thou hast nothing to pay he may lawfully take thy Bed from under thee.

<P>You depart hence, &s;ufficiently ground|ed in the Truth of our Religion, being able to render a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in you to all that &s;hall ask it; which I would have you do upon all Occa&s;ions with Re&s;pect and Reverence, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts; yet following the Advice of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> avoid always all Di&s;putes about Religion, for that rather makes more aver&s;e than per&s;wades; and the earne&s;t de&s;ire of confuting, or the fear of being vanqui&s;hed, tran&s;ports very moderate Men &s;ometimes to dangerous Extremities: Hereby <HI>Charity</HI> is almo&s;t always wound|ed, and <HI>Truth never cleared,</HI> which makes
<PB N="69" REF="42">appear that it may well be &s;aid at this time of Controver&s;ies, what the <HI>Apostle</HI> &s;aid heretofore of Fables and Genealogies, which are endle&s;s; <HI>that they beget rather vain and curious Que&s;tions than Godly Edi|fication,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in the true <HI>Faith</HI> the <HI>Foundation</HI> of Chri&s;tian Vertues, as <HI>Charity</HI> is the <HI>Perfection,</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> the <HI>Crown</HI> thereof: Whereof the fir&s;t hath none but <HI>God</HI> for it's Object, the la&s;t aims only at <HI>our Selves,</HI> and the middlemo&s;t contains our Duty to <HI>God,</HI> to <HI>our Selves,</HI> and to <HI>our Neighbour;</HI> for by <HI>Charity</HI> we learn <HI>all</HI> the Duties of a Spiritual Life, as al&s;o of a Corporeal, which the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> preferreth be|fore the <HI>other two</HI> Chri&s;tian Vertues, where he &s;aith, <HI>that there abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity, the&s;e three; but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is Charity.

<PB N="70" REF="43"><HI>my Son,</HI> as often as you are charitable, you will imitate God in one of his mo&s;t frequent Actions, who is never weary of doing good to us, tho we are &s;o unwor|thy of it. <HI>Do good therefore to all, e&s;pecial|ly to tho&s;e who are of the Hou&s;hold of Faith:</HI> Yet make not that a Pretext to with|hold your <HI>Charity</HI> from all tho&s;e who are not of the &s;ame Communion with you.

<HEAD>Of Civil Duties.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto, <HI>my Son,</HI> I have repre&s;ented unto you your <HI>Duty to God;</HI> as al|&s;o what you <HI>owe</HI> to <HI>your &s;elf</HI> for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake, <HI>&s;eeing that in him we live, and move, and have our Being;</HI> and that all our Thoughts, Words, and Actions ought to tend to|wards <HI>God,</HI> as to their Center. It is now time I &s;hould make you con&s;ider what you <HI>owe</HI> to <HI>Mankind,</HI> to whom you are fa&s;ten'd with the Bonds of a Civil So|ciety.</P>
<P>For I would not have you imagine, that you was born for your &s;elf alone, there lieth an Obligation upon you of
<PB N="72" REF="44">being a Help to your Neighbour. Soli|tarine&s;s is not natural to Man, nay, 'tis even <HI>contrary</HI> to the Will and De&s;ign of the Creator, who plac'd him in the World for <HI>Society-&s;ake.</HI> Rea&s;on was gi|ven him to no other Purpo&s;e but to make u&s;e of it. He has Vertues; he ought to put them in practice: Which he cannot do but with tho&s;e of his own kind, and in a civil Conver&s;e. In this Con|ver&s;e, I would have you u&s;e the <HI>&s;ubtlety</HI> of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> and yet act with the <HI>&s;im|plicity</HI> of the <HI>Dove.</HI> Be ju&s;t and &s;incere, and have always in your Mind this ex|cellent Law of Nature which I cited once before; <HI>Do not to others, what you would not that others &s;hould do to you.</HI> This Law is not onely a Dictate of Nature, and receiv'd generally throughout the Univer&s;e; but <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf makes it a part of <HI>his</HI> Law, when he commands us to love our Neighbour as our &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>My Son,</HI> ob&s;erve this, that <HI>God</HI> doth command you not onely to <HI>love</HI> your Neighbour, but to love him <HI>as your &s;elf,</HI> that is to &s;ay, as heartily, as &s;in|cerely, and with an Affection as ardent as is po&s;&s;ible. This Obligation (as you
<PB N="73" REF="44">may &s;ee) is of a great Extent; but the Goodne&s;s of <HI>God</HI> extends <HI>much farther:</HI> he relinqui&s;heth part of <HI>his Right</HI> for our &s;akes; for tho he has required our Affe|ction entire to him&s;elf, yet he loo&s;eth that Obligation, and is willing we &s;hould have for one another part of that which he had demanded from us, and retain'd wholly for him&s;elf. <HI>Here</HI> he cea&s;eth his <HI>Jealou&s;ie,</HI> he that takes upon him &s;o of|ten the Name of <HI>Jealous,</HI> and through an Exce&s;s of Love which he bears towards us, he is &s;o far from being angry that our Neighbour has a &s;hare in our Affection, that he commands it, and is well pleas'd to create him&s;elf <HI>Rivals</HI> upon <HI>this Account.</HI> Man is not &s;en&s;ible enough of this Good|ne&s;s which is infinite, (as well as the E&s;|&s;ence from whence it proceeds,) for of the <HI>three</HI> kinds of Affections pre&s;cribed to us by the Law of <HI>God,</HI> Man for the mo&s;t part maintains <HI>that</HI> which has a Relation to him&s;elf, taking no Notice of the <HI>other two,</HI> and by an Exce&s;s of Self-love he fails in that which is due to <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Neigh|bour,</HI> by which Vice he becomes in this World a <HI>Complice</HI> with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and therefore cannot but expect to &s;hare with
<PB N="74" REF="45">him his Puni&s;hment in the <HI>next:</HI> There|fore to avoid this, love others as much as you would have them love you.

<P>I cannot &s;ay, <HI>my Son,</HI> whether I have not forgot &s;ome con&s;iderable Point touch|ing your <HI>Duty</HI> to your <HI>Neighbour;</HI> how|ever, if it were &s;o, I have this Comfort left, That if you do ju&s;tly put in Pra|ctice my In&s;tructions upon this Subject, your Neighbour will have <HI>no great Rea|&s;on</HI> to complain of you.

But it is far from being &s;o full of Terrour to tho&s;e who behold it with the <HI>Eyes</HI> of Faith. This Divine Vertue, which

<HEAD>Chri&s;tian and Moral MAXIMES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BE devout without Affectation: Be|ware of &s;eeming &s;o if you are not, for that is Hypocri&s;ie; which being di|rectly again&s;t God, is a kind of Sacri|lege.</P>
<P N="2">II. He that goes about to di&s;gui&s;e him|&s;elf in the &s;ight of God, takes Pains to cheat him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">III. To pray to God without Attenti|on is to pray without Hope.</P>
<P N="4">IV. He that prefers the Plea&s;ures of his Body before the Salvation of his Soul, &s;uffers a Man to be drowned whil&s;t he runs to &s;ave his Cloak.</P>
<P N="5">V. If you have not more care to adorn your Soul with vertuous Qualities than to adorn your Body with fine Cloaths, you offer to an Idol and abandon God.</P>
<P N="6">VI. He that delights in his Sins makes his Plea&s;ures his Executioner.</P>
<PB N="87" REF="51">
<P N="7">VII. An habitual Sin is a Serpent nou|ri&s;hed in their own Bo&s;ome.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. He that goes &s;lowly in the pra|ctice of good Works runs &s;wiftly in the way to Hell.</P>
<P N="9">IX. If you would have God hear your Reque&s;ts, do you hear the Prayers of the Needy.</P>
<P N="10">X. He that is afraid to think of Death will run into De&s;pair when Death comes.</P>
<P N="11">XI. There is no better School for a good Life than the frequent meditating upon a Holy Death.</P>
<P N="12">XII. A &s;erious Meditation of Eternity will cau&s;e you to make good u&s;e of your Time, and will take away the greate&s;t part of the bitterne&s;s of Death.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. A Man is not fully convinced of the Importance of his own Salvation, when he knows his Sins and yet will de|fer his Repentance.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. He that pa&s;&s;eth his Life without Devotion &s;hall not end it without De|&s;pair.</P>
<P N="15">XV. If in your Pro&s;perity you will not hear the Voice of God, you may well fear, that in your Adver&s;ity he will not hear yours.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="52">
<P N="16">XVI. He that hath no fear of God in this Life may well fear his Judgments in the next Life.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Be obliging towards all men, familiar with a few, but be intimate with no more than one alone.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. He that takes Plea&s;ure to keep Company with naughty men, is in Pain whil&s;t he is among the good.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. He that confides without Know|ledg, will repent not without Rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="20">XX. He that begins a Bu&s;ine&s;s with|out Judgment need not wonder if it ends without Succe&s;s.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That which you undertake a|bove your Strength mu&s;t needs produce Effects below your Hopes.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. In a glorious Undertaking, he that is di&s;couraged by the bare Contem|plation of the Difficulties, neither under|&s;tands the value of the Honour, nor doth he at all de&s;erve it.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. If Ha&s;te in de&s;igning, and Slowne&s;s in executing, produce good Suc|ce&s;s, it is by more chance.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. If you make your Work a trouble to you, you will make your Du|ty a Puni&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ment to you.</P>
<PB N="89" REF="52">
<P N="25">XXV. He that in a low Fortune hath too high De&s;igns, undertakes with wax|en Wings to fly up to the Sun.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. He that falls by a&s;piring too high, needs not &s;eek for any other Rea|&s;on of his Fall than his own Extrava|gance.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Tho&s;e who &s;hew them&s;elves over-earne&s;t and eager in &s;mall Bu&s;ine&s;|&s;es, declare their Unfitne&s;s for great ones.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. If by Ju&s;tice you are guided in the pur&s;uit of Gain, Tranquillity &s;hall accompany you in the enjoyment there|of.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. If with an envious Eye you look upon the Good of others, you will render your &s;elf unworthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s your own.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. If the Soul be given to Man only for Action, and tho&s;e who by con|tinual Sloth keep the Soul from Acting, they &s;hew that the Soul in their Bodies is but like a little Salt to pre&s;erve their Bo|dies from putrifying.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Pride is a &s;welling of the Spirit, which doth as much corrupt all the good qualifications of the proud
<PB N="90" REF="53">Man, as the &s;welling of the Stomack al|ters the good humors of the Body.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. Altho Anger be but a &s;hort Madne&s;s, yet the Effects thereof many times prove long Follies.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. Avoid great Meals if you will avoid long Sickne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. He that &s;poyls his health by Exce&s;&s;es and Di&s;order, hath no Rea|&s;on to complain of the Exce&s;s of his Di|&s;tempers.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. An able Cook is more to be feared in time of Health, than an igno|rant Phy&s;ician in time of Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. Temperance and Exerci&s;e are the be&s;t Cooks in the world.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. The Fumes of Wine trou|bles the Brain, the Fumes of Pride trou|bles the Under&s;tanding, and the Fumes of one in Love troubles both.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. He that fills his Heart with the Love of Women, turns a Sanctuary appointed for the Holy Gho&s;t into a Temple of Idols, the Wor&s;hip whereof will lead to Hell.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. Divine Love is a Torch to light us; but profane Love is one to blind us.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="53" MS="y">
<P N="40">XL. Humane Love cannot have Bounds too &s;traight; but if Divine Love be at all bounded it will be deficient.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. Love is painted naked; not only to repre&s;ent Impudence, but to adverti&s;e us, that u&s;ually it &s;trips naked all tho&s;e who follow it.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. The Covetous Man &s;pares things nece&s;&s;ary to provide Superfluities for tho&s;e who will never thank him for them.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. Tho&s;e who in their Actings con&s;ult only &s;elf Love &s;hall walk blind|fold, and have as many Falls as Steps.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. Who &s;pends too much upon his Plea&s;ures; deprives him&s;elf of the Means of providing for Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. If you &s;ubmit your Judgment to your Plea&s;ures, you will Burn your &s;elf with the Light which was given to di|rect you.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. He that con&s;ults not his Rea|&s;on for his Plea&s;ures, ought not to expect help in his pains.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. He that &s;uffers him&s;elf to be governed by his Pa&s;&s;ions, abandons his Liberty to the Fancy of his Slaves.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="54">
<P N="48">XLVIII. Too great de&s;ire after things Superfluous oft throws a Man into ex|treme want of Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. He that fills his Heart with his Pa&s;&s;ions leaves no room for Piety, and changes his condition of Chri&s;tian into that of an Idolater.</P>
<P N="50">L. Since Pa&s;&s;ions are the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Soul, nothing but Temperance is fit to be the Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P N="51">LI. He that exce&s;&s;ively delights in Play, mu&s;t count that he &s;hall dye in Poverty.</P>
<P N="52">LII. Winning at Play is the Bait which Fortune makes u&s;e of to undo us.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. Tho&s;e who Play to recover what they have lo&s;t, add to the lo&s;s of their Money, the lo&s;s of their Rea&s;on, and of|ten times the lo&s;s of the re&s;t of their Money.</P>
<P N="54">LIV. Much Sleep and much Play fill the Stomach with Crudities, and the Pur&s;e with Wind.</P>
<P N="55">LV. Think a little before you Speak, think more before you make a Pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="54">
<P N="56">LVI. In divers affairs you may choo&s;e if you will make a Promi&s;e, but having made a Promi&s;e you cannot di&s;pen&s;e therewith.</P>
<P N="57">LVII. Never di&s;cour&s;e of things where|of you are ignorant, and di&s;cour&s;e but little of what you know, and whether you &s;peak or are &s;ilent do all with di&s;|cretion.</P>
<P N="58">LVIII. Je&s;ting &s;ometimes upholds Conver&s;ation but generally di&s;unites the Je&s;ters. They that de&s;ire to avoid quarrels and live in quiet let them avoid Je&s;ting as a Snare.</P>
<P N="59">LIX. If you do not ea&s;ily bear with the failings of others you will render your own failings un&s;ufferable.</P>
<P N="60">LX. He that carele&s;sly regards the misfortunes of other Men, ought not to think it &s;trainge if others look upon his misfortunes without compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="61">LXI. If you think to oblige Men to be civil and courteous towards you, give them Example by your carriage towards them.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. The Favors which you do to other Men place under your Feet, the Favours
<PB N="94" REF="55">which others do to you place at your Heart.</P>
<P N="63">LXIII. He that forgets favours recei|ved de&s;erves no more.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. Be not &s;low in &s;erving others if you would have them quick in doing Plea&s;ures to you.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. If you are not generous enough to prevent your Friend by good Turns, be not &s;low to requite his to you.</P>
<P N="66">LXVI. A &s;incere Intention, although unprofitable, better repays a good Turn than a forced Acknowledgment.</P>
<P N="67">LXVII. He that brags of a Favour that he hath done, doth much dimini&s;h the merit thereof; for by his Indi&s;cretion he makes it appear, that he is divided betwixt his Vain-glory and his Friend.</P>
<P N="68">LXVIII. He that gives to receive, of a generous Act (which is one of the mo&s;t commendable Qualities of a man of Ho|nour) makes it to be one of the mo&s;t dirty Trades in the World.</P>
<P N="69">LXIX. If you take Plea&s;ure in Lies, Truth will become a Pain to you.</P>
<P N="70">LXX. He that excu&s;eth his Fault by a Lye condemns him&s;elf two ways.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="55">
<P N="71">LXXI. If Lying be u&s;ual with you, you mi&s;tru&s;t all that others tell you.</P>
<P N="72">LXXII. He that makes u&s;e of Cun|ning and Lying to get his Neighbours Goods, imitates the Devil, who made u&s;e of both tho&s;e Qualities to rob our fir&s;t Parent of his Innocence.</P>
<P N="73">LXXIII. The ill u&s;ing of our Goods in this World will be one of the princi|pal and mo&s;t ju&s;t cau&s;e of our mi&s;ery in the next.</P>
<P N="74">LXXIV. He that is not content with a moderate Fortune, oft times takes great Pains to le&s;&s;en it by endeavouring to aug|ment it.</P>
<P N="75">LXXV. He that regulates his De&s;ires by the nece&s;&s;ities of Nature, aims but at a few things; but he that is led by his Lu&s;t gives no Bounds to his De&s;ires.</P>
<P N="76">LXXVI. Be not eager to know other Mens Secrets. Be very re&s;erved in com|municating your own; you are no lon|ger Ma&s;ter of them &s;o &s;oon as you have imparted them to any Per&s;on; and your Example &s;eems to ju&s;tifie his Unfaithful|ne&s;s in di&s;covering them to a third Per|&s;on.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="56">
<P N="77">LXXVII. He that boa&s;ts of his good Qualities, lo&s;es the merit of them by his Pride; and he that hides his good Qua|lities, gives them a higher e&s;teem by his Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P N="78">LXXVIII. High Places make their Heads turn who have but weak Brains, and extraordinary Fortunes trouble the Spirit of tho&s;e who have not good Judg|ments.</P>
<P N="79">LXXIX. A Man hath need of great Con&s;tancy in Adver&s;ity, that he may not be wanting to him&s;elf, and of great Mo|deration in Pro&s;perity, that he may not be wanting to others.</P>
<P N="80">LXXX. Pro&s;perity makes others know truly what we are, and Adver&s;ity makes us know who are our true Friends.</P>
<P N="81">LXXXI. Tho&s;e who haunt us for our Wealth are like Hawks that fly only for the Prey.</P>
<P N="82">LXXXII. He that will not know his Friends in his Pro&s;perity de&s;erves to meet with none in his Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="83">LXXXIII. He that leans over-much on the Friend&s;hip of Great Per&s;ons, will find, &s;ooner or later, that he leans upon a broken Reed.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="56">
<P N="84">LXXXIV. God by his extreme Boun|ty recompen&s;es with extraordinary Fa|vours the lea&s;t Duties which we render to him, but the mo&s;t part of great Per&s;ons who are earthly Gods, make account that they have over rewarded our great|e&s;t Services by a few kind Words.</P>
<P N="85">LXXXV. He that takes great care to pre&s;erve the friend&s;hip of great Men, &s;hall know when he hath need of them, that he hath taken much pains to culti|vate Land that will prove barren.</P>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. A Man who hath excel|lent Parts and great Learning yet makes no u&s;e thereof; is like a good Sword ne|ver drawn out of the Scabbard.</P>
<P N="87">LXXXVII. He that advi&s;es others to be vertuous hath thereby the more rea|&s;on to be &s;o him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="88">LXXXVIII. He that prai&s;es and com|mends only to plea&s;e his complai&s;ance, draws his judgment in que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="89">LXXXIX. The forwardlyne&s;s of a Man to advi&s;e others is oftner a mark of his Pre&s;umption then a proof of his Friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P N="90">XC. He that thinks it enough to be|wail our Evils when he can Cure them,
<PB N="98" REF="57">is not toucht at the Heart, but &s;heds only Crocodiles tears.</P>
<P N="91">XCI. In our great di&s;plea&s;ures our fir&s;t Tears may be ju&s;t, the &s;econd may be hand&s;ome, but tho&s;e after that are nei|ther rea&s;onable nor honorable.</P>
<P N="92">XCII. He that weeps only becau&s;e he thinks he ought to weep may have tend|er Eyes and yet not toucht at the Heart.</P>
<P N="93">XCIII. He that employes his Autho|rity to do ill things or to maintain them, cuts his Throat with his own Knife.</P>
<P N="94">XCIV. Tru&s;t not Flatterers and great Talkers, both of them u&s;ually aim by the wind of their words to drive thy Mo|ney out of thy Pur&s;e.</P>
<P N="95">XCV. Phy&s;icians by their Medicines oft Poy&s;on our Bodies, and Flatterers al|ways Poy&s;on our minds by their Di&s;|cour&s;es.</P>
<P N="96">XCVI. He that makes u&s;e of a much &s;tudied Di&s;cour&s;e to per&s;wade us to an evil De&s;ign, employes a perfumed Pony|ard to &s;tab us at the heart.</P>
<P N="97">XCVII. The infection of the Pe&s;tilence is not &s;o much to be feared for the Body as the Poy&s;on of evil Company for the Mind.</P>
<PB N="99" REF="57">
<P N="98">XCVIII. If you de&s;ire to dye like a righteous Man, live as a Reprobate would wi&s;h to have lived when he comes to dye.</P>
<P N="99">XCIX. He that by his extraordinary complai&s;ance draws off his Friend from a bad Bu&s;ine&s;s by being Surety for him or bayling of him, u&s;ually draws him&s;elf in|to a wor&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s, which at length will make him under&s;tand his own want of Judgment.</P>
<P N="100">C. He that reads for his own in&s;tru|ction, and reads good matters without profiting thereby, hath the ta&s;t of the Mind as much depraved, as the bodily Ta&s;t is to a &s;ick Man who &s;its at a well furni&s;ht Table and not able to eat.</P>
<P>My Son, I having at the beginning of the&s;e In&s;tructions made u&s;e of one of the Proverbs of Solomon, I will make u&s;e of another for the end. 3 Prov. 1, 2, 3, and 4 ver: <HI>My Son, forget not my Law, but let thine heart keep my Com|mandements, for length of Days, and long Life, and Peace &s;hall they add to thee, &s;o &s;halt thou find favour and good under&s;tand|ing in the &s;ight of God and Man.</HI></P>
