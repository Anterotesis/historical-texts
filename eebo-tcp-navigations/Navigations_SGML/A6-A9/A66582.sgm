<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Province OF CAROLINA IN AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAROLINA,</HI> is that part of <HI>Florida,</HI> which lies between <HI>twenty nine</HI> and <HI>thirty &s;ix De|grees,</HI> and <HI>thirty Minutes</HI> of <HI>Northern La|titude:</HI> On the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> it is wa&s;hed with the <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> and is bounded on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> by <HI>Mare Pacificum</HI> (or the South Sea) and within the&s;e bounds is contained the mo&s;t healthy Fertile and plea&s;ant part of <HI>Florida,</HI> which is &s;o much commen|ded by the Spani&s;h Authors.</P>
<P>This <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Carolina,</HI> was in the Year 1663. Granted by <HI>Letters Pattents</HI> in Propriety of his mo&s;t Gracious <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> unto the Right Honourable <HI>Ed|ward
<PB N="6" REF="4">Earl of Clarendon, George</HI> Duke of <HI>Albemarle, William</HI> Earl of <HI>Craven, John</HI> Lord <HI>Berkely, Antho|ny</HI> Lord <HI>A&s;hly,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colleton,</HI> Knights and Barro|nets, Sir <HI>William Berkeley</HI> Knight, by which Letters Pattents the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are to be of force in <HI>Carolina:</HI> but the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have power with the con&s;ent of the Inhabitants to make By-Laws for the better Government of the &s;aid <HI>Province:</HI> So that no Money can be rai&s;ed or Law made, without the con&s;ent of the Inhabitants or their Repre&s;enta|tives. They have al&s;o power to appoint and im|power Governours, and other Magi&s;trates to Grant Liberty of Con&s;cience, make Con&s;titutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> With many other great Priviledges, as by the &s;aid Letters Pattents will more largely appear. And the &s;aid Lords Proprietors have there &s;etled a Con&s;titu|tion of Government, whereby is granted Liberty of Con&s;cience, and wherein all po&s;&s;ible care is taken for the equal Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, and for the la&s;ting Security of the Inhabitants both in their Per|&s;ons and E&s;tates.</P>
<P>By the care and endeavours of the &s;aid Lords Pro|prietors, and at their very great charge, two Colonys have been &s;etled in this <HI>Province,</HI> the one at <HI>Albe|marle</HI> in the mo&s;t Northerly part, the other at <HI>A&s;hly</HI> River, which is in the Latitude of thirty two De|grees odd Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Albemarle</HI> bordering upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> and only ex|ceeding it in Health, Fertility, and Mildne&s;s of the Winter, is in the Growths, Productions, and other things much of the &s;ame nature with it: Wherefore I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with a perticular De|&s;cription of that part; but apply my &s;elf principally
<PB N="7" REF="4">to di&s;cour&s;e of the Collony at <HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> which being many Degrees more Southward than <HI>Virginia,</HI> differs much from it in the Nature of its Clymate and Productions.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;hly-River</HI> was fir&s;t &s;etled in <HI>April</HI> 1670, the Lords Proprietors having at their &s;ole charge, &s;et out three Ve&s;&s;els, with a con&s;iderable number of able Men; eighteen Moneths Victuals, with Cloths, Tools, Ammunition, and what el&s;e was thought nece&s;&s;ary for a new Settlement, and continued at this charge to &s;upply the Collony for divers years after, until the Inhabitants were able by their own Indu&s;try to live of them&s;elves; in which condition they have been for divers years pa&s;t, and are arrived to a very great Degree of Plenty of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions. In&s;omuch, that mo&s;t &s;orts are already cheaper there, than in any other of the Engli&s;h Collonys, and they are plentifully enough &s;upplied with all things from <HI>England</HI> or other Parts.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> about &s;even Miles in from the Sea, di|vides it &s;elf into two Branches; the Southermo&s;t re|taining the name of <HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> the North Branch is called <HI>Cooper-River.</HI> In <HI>May,</HI> 1680. the Lords Pro|prietors &s;ent their Orders to the Government there, appointing the Port-Town for the&s;e two Rivers to be Built on the Poynt of Land that divides them, and to be called <HI>Charles</HI> Town, &s;ince which time about an hundred Hou&s;es are there Built, and more are Building daily by the Per&s;ons of all &s;orts that come there to Inhabit, from the more Northern Engli&s;h Collonys, and the Sugar I&s;lands, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land;</HI> and many Per&s;ons who went to <HI>Carolina</HI> Ser|vants, being Indu&s;trious &s;ince they came out of their times with their Ma&s;ters, at who&s;e charge they were
<PB N="8" REF="5">Tran&s;ported, have gotten good Stocks of Cattle, and Servants of their own; have here al&s;o Built Hou&s;es, and exerci&s;e their Trades: And many that went thi|ther in that condition, are now worth &s;everal Hun|dreds of Pounds, and live in a very plentiful condi|tion, and their E&s;tates &s;till encrea&s;ing. And Land is become of that value near the Town, that it is &s;old for twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Acre, though pillaged of all its valuable Timber, and not cleared of the re&s;t, and Land that is clear'd and fitted for Planting, and Fenced, is let for ten Shillings <HI>per annum</HI> the Acre, though twenty miles di&s;tant from the Town, and &s;ix men will in &s;ix weeks time, Fall, Clear, Fence in, and fit for Planting, &s;ix Acres of Land.</P>
<P>At this Town, in <HI>November,</HI> 1680. There Rode at one time &s;ixteen Sail of Ve&s;&s;els (&s;ome of which were upwards of 200 Tuns) that came from divers parts of the Kings Dominions to trade there, which great concour&s;e of &s;hipping, will undoubtebly in a &s;hort time make it a con&s;iderable Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;tern Shore of America,</HI> whether it be by rea&s;on of its having the great Body of the Conti|nent to the We&s;tward of it, and by con&s;equence the Northwe&s;t-Wind (which Flows contrary to the Sun) the Freezing-Wind, as the North-Ea&s;t is in <HI>Europe,</HI> or that the Frozen Lakes which Lye-in, be|yond <HI>Canada,</HI> and lye <HI>North</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> from the Shore, Impregnate the Freezing Wind with more chill and congealing qnalities, or that the uncultivated Earth, covered for the mo&s;t part with large &s;hading Trees, breathes forth more nitrous Vapours, than that which is cultivated; or all the&s;e Rea&s;ons together, it is certainly much more cold than any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the &s;ame Degree of Latitude of thirty nine and forty,
<PB N="9" REF="5">and more <HI>North,</HI> though above &s;ix hundred Miles nearer the Sun than <HI>England;</HI> is notwith&s;tanding, many Degrees colder in the Winter.</P>
<P>The Author having been informed by tho&s;e that &s;ay they have &s;een it, that in tho&s;e Parts it Freezeth above &s;ix Inches thick in a Night, and great Navi|gable Rivers are Frozen over in the &s;ame &s;pace of time; and the Country about <HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> though within nine Degrees of the <HI>Tropick,</HI> hath &s;eldom any Winter that doth not produce &s;ome Ice, though I cannot yet learn that any hath been &s;een on Rivers or Ponds, above a quarter of an Inch thick, which vani&s;heth as &s;oon as the Sun is an hour or two high, and when the Wind is not at <HI>North-we&s;t,</HI> the wea|ther is very mild. So that the <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> of <HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e to be of the &s;ame Tempe|rature with the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> and beginning of <HI>April</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> this &s;mall Winter cau&s;eth a fall of the Leaf, and adapts the Country to the pro|duction of all the Grains and Fruits of <HI>England,</HI> as well as tho&s;e that require more Sun; in&s;omuch, that at <HI>A&s;hly-River,</HI> the Apple, the Pear, the Plum, the Quince, Apricock, Peach, Medlar, Walnut, Mulber|ry, and Che&s;nut, thrive very well in the &s;ame Gar|den, together with the Orange, the Lemon, the O|live, the Pomgranate, the Fig and Almond; nor is the Winter here Cloudy, Overca&s;t, or Foggy, but it hath been ob&s;erved that from the twentieth of <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> to the tenth of <HI>March,</HI> including all the Winter Months, there have been but eight overca&s;t days, and though Rains fall pretty often in the Winter, it is mo&s;t commonly in quick Showers, which when pa&s;t, the Sun &s;hines out clear again.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<P>The Summer is not near &s;o hot as in <HI>Virginia,</HI> or the other Northern American Engli&s;h Collonys, which may hardly gain belief with tho&s;e that have not con&s;idered the rea&s;on; which is its neerne&s;s to the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> which makes it in a greater mea&s;ure than tho&s;e parts more Northward partake of tho&s;e Breezes, which almo&s;t con&s;tantly ri&s;e about eight or nine of the Clock, within the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> and blow fre&s;h from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> till about four in the Afternoon; and a little after the Sea-breeze dys away, there ri|fes a North-wind, which blowing all night, keeps it fre&s;h and cool. In &s;hort, I take <HI>Carolina</HI> to be much of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e delicious Countries about <HI>Aleppo, Antioch,</HI> and <HI>Smyrna:</HI> but hath the ad|vantage of being under an equal Engli&s;h Govern|ment.</P>
<P>Such, who in this Country have &s;eated them&s;elves near great Mar&s;hes, are &s;ubject to Agues, as tho&s;e are who are &s;o &s;eated in <HI>England:</HI> but &s;uch who are planted more remote from Mar&s;hes or &s;tanding Wa|ters, are exceeding healthy; in&s;omuch, that out of a Family con&s;i&s;ting of never le&s;s than twelve Per|ons, not one hath died &s;ince their fir&s;t Arrival there, which is nine years: but what is more, not one hath been &s;ick in all that time; nor is there one of the Ma&s;ters of Families that went over in the fir&s;t Ve&s;|&s;els, dead of &s;ickne&s;s in <HI>Carolina,</HI> except one, who was &s;eventy and five years of Age before he came there; though the number of tho&s;e Ma&s;ters of Fa|milies be pretty con&s;iderable: divers per&s;ons that went out of <HI>England</HI> Pti&s;ical, and Con&s;umptive, have recover'd, and others &s;ubject in <HI>England</HI> to frequent fits of the Stone, have been ab&s;olutely freed from them after they have been there a &s;hort time; nor is
<PB N="10" REF="6">the Gout there yet known. The Ayr gives a &s;trony Appetite and quick Dige&s;tion, nor is it witetlh &s;uitable effects, men finding them&s;elves apparntly more light&s;ome, more prone, and more able to al Youthful Exerci&s;es, than in <HI>England,</HI> the Women are very Fruitful, and the Children have fre&s;h San|guine Complexions.</P>
<P>The Soyle is generally very fertile, but hath &s;ome &s;andy tracts &s;o as to make an agreable variety, but even this Land produceth good Corne and is excellent pa&s;ture; Wheat, <HI>Rye, Barly, Oates,</HI> and Peas, thrive exceedingly, and the ground yeilds in greater abun|dance than in <HI>England, Turnips, Par&s;nips, Carrots, Potatoes,</HI> and <HI>Edoes,</HI> a &s;ub&s;tantial whole&s;ome nouri&s;hing Root growes well, and all excellent in their kindes they have near twenty &s;orts of Pul&s;e that we have not in <HI>England,</HI> all of them very good food, in&s;omuch that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Garden Bean is not regarded.</P>
<P>Near the Sea the Trees are not very large, they grow pritty neare together; farther up they are larger, and grow farther a&s;under, and are in mo&s;t parts free from Underwood, &s;o that you may &s;ee near half a mile among&s;t the bodyes of large tall timber trees, who&s;e tops meeting make a very plea&s;ing &s;hade, yet hinders not gra&s;s, myrtle and other &s;weet &s;centing &s;hrubs here and there from growing under them: Among&s;t the&s;e Groves of Timber Trees are here and there Savana's, (or gra&s;sy plains) of &s;everall magni|tudes clear of Trees, which hath occa&s;ion'd &s;ome that have &s;eene them to compare <HI>Carolina</HI> to tho&s;e plea&s;ant Parks in <HI>England,</HI> that have abundance of tall Timber Trees unlop'd, here you may hunt the Hare, Fox, and Deere all day long in the &s;hade, and freely
<PB N="12" REF="7">&s;pur your hor&s;e through the <HI>Woods</HI> to follow the cha&s;e.</P>
<P>This Country hath the Oak, A&s;h, Elm, Poplar, Beech, and all the other &s;orts of u&s;efull Timber that <HI>England</HI> hath, and divers &s;orts of la&s;ting Timber that <HI>England</HI> hath not, as Cedar white and red, Cypre&s;s, Locu&s;t, Bay and Laurell Trees, equal to the bigge&s;t Oaks, large Mirtles, Hickery, black Wallnut, and Pynes big enough to Ma&s;t the greate&s;t Ships, and divers other &s;orts, which I cannot enumerate.</P>
<P>The woods abound with <HI>Hares, Squirrels, Ratoons Po&s;sums, Conyes</HI> and <HI>Deere,</HI> which la&s;t are &s;o plenty that an Indian hunter hath kill'd nine fatt Deere in a day all &s;hott by him&s;elf, and all the con&s;iderable Planters have an Indian hunter which they hire for je&s;s than twenty &s;hillings a year, and one hunter will very well find a Family of thirty people with as much Veni&s;on and Foul, as they can well eat. Here are al&s;o in the woods great plenty of wilde <HI>Turkeys, Partridges,</HI> &s;omething &s;maller than tho&s;e of <HI>England,</HI> but more deicate, <HI>Turtle Doves, Paraquetos,</HI> and <HI>Pidgeons:</HI> On the gra&s;sy plaines the whi&s;tling <HI>Plover</HI> and <HI>Cranes</HI> and divers &s;orts of Birds unknowne in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Carolina</HI> doth &s;o abound in Rivers, that within fifty miles of the Sea you can hardly place your &s;elf &s;even miles from a Navigable River, and divers are naviga|ble for good big Ve&s;&s;els above three hundred miles: The Rivers abound with variety of excellent Fi&s;h, and near the Sea with very good Oy&s;ters, in many of which are Pearl: the Author having &s;een Pearl that have been taken out of &s;ome of them bigger than Rouncival Pea&s;e, and perfectly round. On the Rivers and brooks are all the winter moneths va&s;t quantitys of <HI>Swan, wild Gee&s;e, Duck, Widgeon, Teale, Curlew, Snype, Shell Drake,</HI> and a certaine &s;ort <HI>of black
<PB N="13" REF="7">Duck</HI> that is excellent meat, and &s;tayes there all the year.</P>
<P>Neat Cattle thrive and increa&s;e here exceedingly, there being perticular Planters that have already &s;e|ven or eight hundred head, and will in a few years in all probability, have as many thou&s;ands, unle&s;s they &s;ell &s;ome part; the Cattle are not &s;ubject to any Di&s;ea&s;e as yet perceiv'd, and are fat all the Year long without any Fother, the little Winter they have, not pinching them &s;o as to be perceiv'd, which is a great advantage the Planters here have of the more Northern Plantations who are all forc'd to give their Cattle Fother, and mu&s;t &s;pend a great part of their Summers Labour in providing three or four Months Fother for their Cattle in the Winter, or el&s;e would have few of them alive in the Spring, which will keep them from ever having very great Heards, or be able to do much in Planting any Co|modity for Forreign Markets; the providing Win|ter Food for their Cattle, taking up &s;o much of their Summers Labour; So that many Judicious Per&s;ons think that <HI>Carolina</HI> will be able by Sea, to &s;upply tho&s;e Northern Collonys, with &s;alted Beef for their Shipping, cheaper than they them&s;elves with what is bred among&s;t them; for, con&s;idering that all the Woods in <HI>Carolina</HI> afford good Pa&s;turage, and the &s;mall <HI>Rent</HI> that is paid to the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> for Land, an Ox is rai&s;ed at almo&s;t as little expence in <HI>Carolina,</HI> as a Hen is in <HI>England.</HI> And it hath by experience been found that Beef will take &s;alt at <HI>A&s;hly-River</HI> any Month in the Year, and &s;ave very well.</P>
<P>Ewes have mo&s;t commonly two or three Lambs at a time; their Wool is a good Staple, and they thrive
<PB N="13" REF="8">very well, but require a Shepherd to drive them to Feed, and to bring them home at night to pre&s;erve them from the Wolves.</P>
<P>Hogs increa&s;e in <HI>Carolina</HI> abundantly, and in a man|ner without any charge or trouble to the Planter, only to make them Sheds, wherein they may be pro|tected from the Sun and Rain, and Morning and E|vening to give them a little Indian Corn, or the pickings and parings of <HI>Potatoes, Turnips,</HI> or other Roots, and at the &s;ame time blowing a Horn, or ma|king any other con&s;tant noy&s;e, to which being us'd, they will afterwards upon hearing it, repair home, the re&s;t of their Food they get in the Woods, of Ma&s;ts, and Nuts of &s;everal &s;orts; and when tho&s;e fail, they have Gra&s;s and Roots enough, the ground being never frozen &s;o hard as to keep them from Rooting, the&s;e conveniencies breeds them large, and in the Ma&s;t time they are very fat, all which makes the rearing them &s;o ea&s;y, that there are ma|ny Planters that are &s;ingle and have never a Servant, that have two or three hundred Hogs, of which they make great profit; <HI>Barbados, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> affording a con&s;tant good price for their Pork; by which means they get wherewithal to build them more convenient Hou&s;es, and to purcha&s;e Servants, and <HI>Negro-&s;laves.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There have</HI> been imported into <HI>Carolina,</HI> about an hundred and fifty Mares, and &s;ome Hor&s;es from <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Road-I&s;land,</HI> which breeds well, and the Coalts they have are finer Lim'd and Headed than their Dams or Sires, which gives great hopes of an excellent breed of Hor&s;es, as &s;oon as they have gotten good Stalions among&s;t them.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="8">
<P><HI>Negros,</HI> By rea&s;on of the mildne&s;s of the Winter thrive and &s;tand much better, than in any of the more Northern Collonys, &amp; require le&s;s clothes, which is a great charge &s;av'd.</P>
<P>With the Indians the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have a perfect freind|&s;hip, they being both u&s;efull to one another. And care is taken by the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> that no Inju&s;tice &s;hall be done them; In order to which they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a particular Court of Judicature, (com|pos'd of the &s;obere&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;sed Inhabi|tants) to determine all differnces that &s;hall happen between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and any of the <HI>Indians,</HI> this they do upon a Chri&s;tian and Moral Con&s;ideration, and not out of any apprehen&s;ion of danger from them, for the <HI>Indians</HI> have been always &s;o ingaged in Wars one Town or Village again&s;t another (their Govern|ment being u&s;ually of no greater extent) that they have not &s;uffered any increa&s;e of People, there having been &s;everal Nations in a manner quite extirpated by Wars among&s;t them&s;elves &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;etled at <HI>A&s;hly</HI> River: This keeps them &s;o thin of people, and &s;o divided, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have not the lea&s;t ap|prehen&s;ions of danger from them; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being already too &s;trong for all the <HI>Indians</HI> within five hun|dred Miles of them, if they were united, and this the <HI>Indians</HI> as well know, that they will never dare to break with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or do an Injury to any par|ticular per&s;on, for fear of having it reveng'd upon their whole Nation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> do at pre&s;ent grant to all per&s;ons that come there to Inhabit as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> To each Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tri&s;s of a Family fifty acres, and for every able &s;on or man &s;ervant they &s;hall carry or cau&s;e to be tran&s;ported into <HI>Carolina</HI> fifty acres more, and the like for each Daughter or woman &s;ervant that
