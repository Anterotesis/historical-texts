<P>_THe Lords of His Maje&s;ties mo&s;t Honorable Privy-Coun|cell, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners for con&s;erving of the Peace, according to the great tru&s;t repo&s;ed on them by His Ma|je&s;ty and the E&s;tates of Par|liament, whereof they are to make account to God and His Maje&s;ty the next en&s;uing Par|liament, Taking to their deepe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erious con|&s;ideration the be&s;t wayes of pre&s;erving the peace of this Kingdom, That all His Maje&s;ties good and duti|full Subjects may enjoy their Religion, Liberties, and Laws, which GOD in a &s;ingular and wonderfull providence in the time of His Maje&s;ties Raign hath vouch&s;afed them, And of the peace betwixt the two Kingdoms &s;o unanimou&s;ly and happily e&s;tabli&s;hed in the late Treaty of peace, and in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, Have faithfully endeavoured by all good means to reduce <HI>IRELAND</HI> to His Maje|&s;ties obedience, which through the unnaturall, barba|rous, and Antichri&s;tian cruelty of Papi&s;ts, is from a peaceable Kingdom turned into a &s;tage of unexampled and unexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;eries, to be looked upon as an hor|rid and dangerous example by this Kingdom, And by their earne&s;t &s;upplications to His Maje&s;tie, and their
<PB N="4" REF="3">Declarations to the Parliament of England, but e&s;pe|cially by their earne&s;t de&s;ires for e&s;tabli&s;hing Unity of Religion, and Uniformity of Kirk-government, and for disbanding all Papi&s;ts in Arms within their Domi|nions, and by the humble offer of their meditation to remove the unhappy differences, and quench the fire of a wa&s;ting Warre, begun betwixt His Maje&s;ty and His Subjects of England, wherein His Maje&s;ties &s;acred Per&s;on is expo&s;ed to &s;o great danger, and &s;o many thou|&s;ands of His Subjects have already peri&s;hed: But find|ing to their great grief the &s;ucce&s;&s;e no way an&s;werable to their endeavours and expectation, and the trouble of the neighbouring Kingdoms, and the dangers of this Kingdom daily ari&s;ing to a greater height, then they by their care, coun&s;ell, and diligence, were able to remeid or obviate, they did re&s;olve for this and other cau&s;es, which exerci&s;e and heavily pre&s;&s;e the Kingdom at this time, to call a convention of the E&s;tates, as the only meane (His Maje&s;ty not thinking fit to hearken unto their motion of calling a Parliament) which might by common coun&s;ell, con&s;ent and re&s;olution, take the be&s;t cour&s;e for repre&s;enting yet more &s;en&s;ibly the&s;e manifold evils and dangers, and for over-coming by greater wi&s;dom the difficulties which were above their power.</P>
<P>In the mean while (which they cannot but attribute to the mercifull and marveilous Providence of GOD, and which is a confirmation to them of their re&s;oluti|on in calling a convention, and layeth the greater nece&s;&s;ity upon the E&s;tates, to meet the more willingly and frequently) a treacherous and damnable Plot of the Iri&s;h, Engli&s;h, and Scotti&s;h Papi&s;ts, is begun to be di&s;|covered, by the unexpected apprehending of the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> coming from York, where he had keeped his
<PB N="5" REF="3">meetings and corre&s;pondence by Letters, with certaine Popi&s;h Lords his confederates, and among&s;t others, with the Earl of <HI>Nithi&s;dail</HI> and Vicount of <HI>Aboyne,</HI> Their de|villi&s;h de&s;igns and devices are come to light, &amp; brought to our knowledge, partly by Letters from Ireland, &s;hewing the depo&s;ition and confe&s;&s;ion of a &s;ervant of the Earle of <HI>Antrims,</HI> and partly by Letters which were found in the Earle his own pockets, all &s;ent to them from Ireland: His &s;ervant who was hanged at Carricke-Fergus the <GAP DESC="blank"> day of May, deponed (as the Letters beare) before and at the time of his death, that the de&s;igne was to reconcile the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h in Ireland, that they by their joynt power, having expel|led the Scots, the Iri&s;h Forces there might bee &s;ent a|gain&s;t the Parliament of England, to deale with &s;ome fit in&s;trument there, by all their &s;trength to &s;urprize the I&s;les and the High-Lands, and to depopulate and wa&s;te &s;o much of this Kingdome as their power could extend unto, being a&s;&s;ured of the like dealing in the North, by the Papi&s;ts and their a&s;&s;i&s;tance there, And to have a Ma|gazine at Carlile for twenty thou&s;and men, to fall in with an ho&s;tility upon the &s;outh parts of this Kingdom. The Letters &s;ent from <HI>Nithi&s;dail</HI> and <HI>Aboyne,</HI> all written and &s;ub&s;cribed by their hands to the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> and found with him, although in &s;ome things covertly writ|ten, do carry thus much expre&s;ly, that for furtherance of the de&s;igne &amp; point re&s;olv'd on, there was a&s;&s;i&s;tance a&s;&s;u|red from the Iles, &amp; from the North, &amp; &s;outh of Scot|land, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t Ammunition and Arms, without which they thinke their &s;ervice u&s;ele&s;&s;e, were appointed to be &s;ent to the North, and other parts of this Kingdom, And that Popi&s;h Officers were commanded, and had undertaken to go into Scotland; of which we are informed, &s;ome are already gone to the North, for &s;topping, and di&s;|appointing

As the Lords of his Maje|&s;ties Privy Councell have given order that <HI>Nithi&s;dail</HI> and <HI>Aboyne</HI> be cited, and criminally pur&s;ued of high Trea&s;on, and have made the &s;ame as a matter of pub|lick and mo&s;t high importance knowne to his Maje&s;tie, and to the Parliament of England; &s;o they and the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Peace al&s;o, for acquitting them&s;elves in their tru&s;t, and for the &s;afety of the Kingdom, do make the &s;ame publickly known to al his Maje&s;ties good &s;ub|jects, that being forewarned of their danger, they may be upon their guards, and prepared again&s;t forraigne in|va&s;ion and inte&s;tine plots and in&s;urrection: And e&s;peci|ally, that the Noble men, Commi&s;&s;ioners of Shires, and Burrows, perceiving greater and more apparent ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the approaching convention then they could have wi&s;hed or expected, May at the day formerly ap|pointed, meet in &s;uch celerity, and with &s;uch publicke affection and di&s;po&s;ition of heart, as the pre&s;ent condi|tion of affairs doth require, and call for at their hands, and as be&s;eemeth the lovers of their Religion, King, and Countrey, which are in &s;o great danger, from pa|pi&s;ts, Athei&s;ts, and other degenerated country men, who are no le&s;&s;e inraged again&s;t this Kingdome, even &s;ince the late Reformation of this Kirke, then were their predece&s;&s;ours at the fir&s;t reformation of Religion, when their negotiating was &s;o re&s;tle&s;&s;e, and their attempts &s;o many, and malicious again&s;t the work of God in this Land: nor is it to be pa&s;t without ob&s;ervation, that while His Maje&s;ty is making a publick Declaration of his in|tentions to defend and maintaine the Religion, Rights and Liberties of this Kingdom, according to the laws,

And whereas the Lords of Councel are informed, that the late Act of Councel for publi&s;hing his Maje&s;ties Decla|ration is mi&s;taken by &s;undry, as a Declaration of their own judgement, concerning the proceedings of another Kingdom; For preventing of this mi&s;take, They thinke fit to remember and declare according to the act of Councel in Ianuary la&s;t, &s;hewing that their Lord&s;hips giving warrant to print any paper comming from His Maje&s;tie, or Parliament of England, did not import their approbation of the contents thereof: That they did on the fir&s;t of Iune, both remember the famine, &amp; expre&s;&s;e their intention in this publication to be farre from taking on them to judge of the proceedings of the Parliament of another Kingdom; but only to thanke his Maje&s;ty for His gracious expre&s;&s;ions towards the pre&s;ervation of the Rights and Liberties of this Kingdome: And ordaines this to be printed and publi&s;hed at the Market Cro&s;&s;e of Edinburgh, and all other Burghs within this Kingdom, for the information of his Maje&s;ties Subjects within the &s;ame.</P>
