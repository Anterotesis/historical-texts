<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen, and deare fellow Seamen:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Would no wayes have you to wonder, that notwith&s;tanding the Oathes I have taken, and the ingagements I have made, together with my credit, and the tru&s;t the Parliament put in me, I &s;hould neverthele&s;&s;e leave the Parliament, and now betake my &s;elfe unto the &s;ervice of my Soveraigne gracious King <HI>Charles,</HI> in which I am re&s;olved to live and dye.</P>
<P>For my Oathes, the Solemne League and Covenant, binde us unto the pre&s;ervation of Religion, and Liberties, and to maintaine, and defend the Kings Per&s;on and Authority.</P>
<P>Concerning Religion, &s;ince wee tooke the Covenant that is almo&s;t quite lo&s;t, and that which ought to be but One, is now increa&s;ed into &s;o many, that the Religion of the&s;e times, is like unto a Common-Queane, that hath borne a Childe unto every Whorema&s;ter in the Pari&s;h, and hath as many names and &s;ir|names for her Ba&s;tards, as &s;he hath had Fornicators for their Fathers; and therefore is it that &s;ince wee left the old Prote|&s;tant Religion of the Church of England, which King <HI>Charles</HI> well maintained, Anabapti&s;ts, Browni&s;ts, Fameli&s;ts, Era&s;tians, Quakers, Shakers, Independents, and many more Sects which are unworthy the naming, are &s;o ripe among&s;t us, becau&s;e wee have left our fir&s;t love, and our fir&s;t faith, and are gone almo&s;t every one as the Scripture &s;ayes, a whoring after our owne in|ventions; &s;o that the truth and life of Religion is even quite lo&s;t in us; and you know fellow &s;eamen, that there was never &s;o much cunning and cozening, and &s;uch deceipt in trade among&s;t us, as &s;ince the&s;e holy profe&s;&s;ors began to increa&s;e: Be&s;ides how for our wavering, and ficklene&s;&s;e in Religion are we mar|ked and pointed at beyond the Seas: And no marvell wee are become a &s;corne unto others, if wee con&s;ider how much wor&s;e and more corrupt wee are growne in our manners; for &s;ince this new preaching and praying came among&s;t us, I &s;ee no a|mendment in our lives, onely our profe&s;&s;ors can &s;inne with
<PB N="4" REF="3">more &s;ecre&s;ie and cunning, and doe allow that unto them&s;elves under &s;ome name in Religion, which they condemne in others, whoring, and cheating, and lying, and di&s;&s;embling, being no faults in the&s;e men, when they will openly raile at the merri|ments or drunkene&s;&s;e, which I doe not excu&s;e of other men; as though Almighty God, and they &s;ay &s;o too, would &s;ee no &s;inne in the&s;e Saints, and you may ob&s;erve this &s;ort of men, much more ambitious and coveteous then other men are: You &s;ee that our old hone&s;t preaching, which gave us in&s;truction for our conver&s;ation towards God and man, and to lead our lives in all hone&s;ty and godline&s;&s;e of living, is turned into rayling again&s;t the King, and the Bi&s;hops, and the Cavaliers, and our old go|vernment in Church and Common-wealth, under which God did much more ble&s;&s;e us then now; yea not onely the Mini|&s;ters, but every other man preaches among&s;t us, and men that cannot well read will be expounding the Scriptures, though St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays there are many things in them hard to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the booke of Common-prayer, which I have heard, the Martyrs of the Prote&s;tant Religion gathered together was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, every man prayeth and prates as he plea&s;eth, and men are become more confident and familiar with God, and be much le&s;&s;e humble then ever the Saints, or Chri&s;t him|&s;elfe were in their prayers &s;et downe unto us in the Scripture, praying for nothing but what may plea&s;e them, or for a ble&s;&s;ing upon the plots of the Parliament; yet the&s;e who doe thus de|&s;troy Religion, are wee &s;ee the men whom the Parliament prin|cipally encourage, which &s;ure cannot be thought the pre&s;ervati|on of Religion according unto the Covenant.</P>
<P>For our liberties, though I cannot I prai&s;e God much com|plaine my &s;elfe, yet I have heard ten times more &s;tories of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Subjects &s;ince the Parliament &s;ate, then in the whole Reigne of King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles;</HI> yet wee know how many worthy Commanders and Seamen have been put out of their places, and ca&s;t into pri&s;on, <HI>[as Stradling, Ket|tleby, A&s;hly, and others,]</HI> unto the utter undoing of their wives and children, without any examination or offence pro|ved, but meerely for &s;u&s;pition that they loved the King; were
<PB N="5" REF="3">plainely &s;ee there is no Law, but the will of the Parliament, and whereas before it was lawfull to &s;ue the King him&s;elfe in any of the Courts, now a Parliament man mu&s;t not be toucht: And who can &s;ay that ever he could get any ju&s;tice again&s;t a Parliament man by a Petition unto the Hou&s;es?</P>
<P>In the Covenant wee have &s;worne to defend the Kings Per&s;on and Authority; yet wee know that he hath been long kept &s;o &s;traight a Pri&s;oner, that the meane&s;t Sub|ject would have thought him&s;elfe very much wronged to have been kept &s;o long in pri&s;on without a hearing; for the Kings Authority, the very name of that is &s;carce left us, when it is become a great fault to pray for the King, or to drinke unto his health; although Gods word bids us pray for Kings, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.2. And if the lea&s;t &s;igne of duty, and well wi&s;hing unto him can be di&s;covered; it is proofe e|nough to put a man out of any place of profit or tru&s;t. You &s;ee how wel the Parliament have maintained the Kings Au|thority, when that they have voted that no further Addre&s;|&s;es be made unto him, and when the Army have in their De|claration told us, That they are re&s;olved to &s;ettle the go|vernment without a King, and again&s;t him, and again&s;t all that take part with him; which is the &s;ame thing, as to &s;ay, That they will have no King at all to raigne over them: There can be no man &s;o &s;illy &s;ure, as to thinke that the Parli|ament or Army ever thinke to have a King, when they will not proceed again&s;t <HI>Rolph,</HI> who hath three witne&s;&s;es to prove again&s;t him a de&s;igne to take away the Kings life by the per&s;wa&s;ion of the Army, becau&s;e no doubt many of both Hou&s;es had their hands with him in the plot.</P>
<P>For the Covenant, though I could have been well con|tented that I had never taken it; I believe I have kept it better in leaving the Parliament, then I &s;hould have done by &s;taying in their &s;ervice; for they have put downe both Religion, and the King, and broken the Covenant in every point, but in pulling downe the Prelates, and that it mu&s;t be thought was to get the Bi&s;hops Lands for them&s;elves; for Popery, wee &s;ee they pa&s;&s;e not much of it.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>The Covenant was for the pre&s;ervation of Religion, and li|berties, and to maintaine the Kings Per&s;on and authority, this Oath I tooke, and &s;o far will keepe it (God a&s;&s;i&s;ting) pre&s;erve to my power the Prote&s;tant Religion, which the Parliament practi&s;e to &s;uppre&s;&s;e; and defend the King, whom the Parlia|ment would depo&s;e: they were the ends for which I tooke the Oath; I breake not my Oath and tru&s;t, when I keepe the end of my Oath and tru&s;t, which were to pre&s;erve Religion, and defend the King; if they will (as they do) de&s;troy both, it is they have broke their Oath and tru&s;t; and not I; for I would never have undertaken a tru&s;t to de&s;troy the&s;e two things, which every Chri&s;tian ought to &s;erve and honour, his Religion and King, which &s;ince the Parliament (as all men &s;ee) have done, let them tru&s;t unto them&s;elves, and their Sectaries; no ho|ne&s;t man that hath a con&s;cience unto God, can keepe &s;uch a tru&s;t, unle&s;&s;e he will commit the greate&s;t &s;inne again&s;t God, and his owne Con&s;cience: and therefore deare fellow Sea-men be no longer abu&s;ed by the devices of the Parliament, but re|turne unto your duty of obedience unto God and the King, Give unto God the things that are Gods, and unto Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ars <HI>Matt.</HI> 22.21. joyne your hearts and hands with us your Brethren now in the Kings &s;ervice, to re|&s;tore the prote&s;tant Religion, and his Maje&s;tyes Religion ought to be one and the &s;ame, we ought not to halt betweene two Religions, 1. <HI>Kings</HI> 18.19. There are now in&s;tead of two Religions more then the Moone hath changes in the yeare: let us &s;et up the old prote&s;tant Religion, u&s;ed in King <HI>Edwards</HI> dayes, in ble&s;&s;ed Queene <HI>Elizabeths</HI> dayes, in King <HI>James</HI> his happy dayes, and in the Raigne of King <HI>Charles,</HI> which was a pro&s;perous time, untill the Parliament Ruled, and &s;uffred him not to Raigne: Let us re&s;tore the King who hath beene more wronged then ever Prince was; Gods word commands us to honour our King, not to think ill of him, much le&s;&s;e to &s;peake ill of him, and &s;urely lea&s;t of all to lift up our hands or &s;ight a|gain&s;t him, which who&s;oever doth &s;hall receive unto him&s;elfe damnation, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.8. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 10.20. <HI>Job</HI> 34.18. 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 26.9. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.31. <HI>Ecle.</HI> 8.2. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1. Our
<PB N="7" REF="4">King is a good King, a mo&s;t gracious Prince, tender of his Subjects, loving to his Queene, carefull of his Children, cour|teous to his people, bountifull to his Servants, zealous towards God; his whole life was never &s;tained with a foule fault, what man is there in both the Hou&s;es like him for conver&s;ation? what leading man is there among&s;t them that may not be mar|ked forth by &s;ome &s;inne? let us then lend our helpe unto him, and pull downe his Enemies: The &s;trengths of the Kingdome (whereof the Navy are the chiefe) are by the Law the Kings; I have heard that what in the time of Peace is a private mans property if it be a &s;trength (put to the ca&s;e a Ca&s;tle or &s;hip of de|fence) during time of war becomes the Kings, by the Law of the Land: the Parliament have wre&s;ted the King out of his Rights, out of the &s;trengths of the Kingdome, both by Sea and Land: It is in your power in part to right him, and to deliver unto him not onely what is always his owne, the Royall Navy, but al&s;o what this war maks his the u&s;e of all ve&s;&s;els of defence.</P>
<P>The Sea-men are the wall of this Iland, do your duties, there is no man can put a tru&s;t upon you or you receive any, but that which &s;tands with your duty to your Prince, which you owe unto him, and whil&s;t you do you make no breach of tru&s;t unto any other; for you do but what hone&s;ty requires, give every man his owne, and this we ought to do, or otherwi&s;e you joyne with them that wrong the King, in not giving unto him what the Lawes of the Land give unto him: for &s;uppo&s;e a man take away a pur&s;e of money upon the high-way from ano|ther and gives me who know not be came by it by robbery, this pur&s;e to keep, afterwards I certainely finde that the money is not his, but an hone&s;t mans from whom he tooke it by violence: unto which of the two (think you) am I bound to re&s;tore the pur&s;e? whether unto him who gave it me in tru&s;t to keep, or unto the true owner? Certainely unto the true owner, when I know him to be &s;o, and not unto the robber; for then I make my &s;elfe a thiefe with him; for he cannot tru&s;t me with that which is properly another mans, and the Lawes of God and man, bids us give unto every man that which is his owne; and &s;o would I wi&s;h you deare
<PB N="8" REF="5">fellow Sea-men to do, and what I &s;peake unto you, I &s;peake likewi&s;e unto the Water-men; that Com|pany hath alwaies beene a Nur&s;ery of able Sea-men.</P>
<P>By this cour&s;e ye &s;hall not only do what every Chri&s;tian ought to be carefull of, your duty to God and your King, but al&s;o exceedingly relieve your Countrey, and benefit your &s;elves; for you know the great decay of trade, and how the Merchants (by whom the mo&s;t of you live) are al|mo&s;t beggered, which hath brough &s;uch great want upon many of you, and your poore families; only the Sea-men have not been &s;o poore &s;ince the memory of man, and &s;ure|ly becau&s;e of our di&s;obedience unto our Soveraigne King <HI>Charles</HI> is this great cur&s;e come upon us, we were fir&s;t u&s;ed to &s;erve the Parliaments wicked turnes again&s;t the King: Returne then hone&s;t hearts unto your King, and doubt not but you will recover your lo&s;|&s;es, and gaine Gods ble&s;&s;ing upon you; we have great encouragements to gather and keepe together to doe this good worke, wee have able and good Churchmen with us, who have not turned about with the winds of new doctrines; we have many well borne Gentlemen among&s;t as Com|manders, we have the Kings Son, his Highne&s;&s;e the Doke of Yorke our Admirall; we &s;tand up for our Religion, our King, and our liberties, all which the Sectaries trample upon, and would pull downe.</P>
