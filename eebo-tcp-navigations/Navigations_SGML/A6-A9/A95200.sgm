<HEAD>A true Relation of my Lord of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Encounter.</HEAD>
<P>_PRince ROBERT being landed at <HI>Dover,</HI> and having fully re|covered his health (which he lo&s;t by a fall from his hor&s;e) made ha&s;te unto his Maje&s;ty, where hee was &s;o courteou&s;ly entertaind, being made Knight of the mo&s;t Noble Order of the Garter, that it gave him great encourage|ment for to attempt any enterprize were it never &s;o dangerous, many malitious practices he u&s;ed upon the Northern parts, e&s;pecially <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> but my Lord of <HI>Stamford</HI> having intelli|gence that hee had &s;eizd upon <HI>Harborow</HI> a &s;mall, yet well fortified Towne, in tho&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="3">went both Hor&s;e and foote to the num|ber of 600 to meet him, marching to|wards the &s;aid place and to Prevent his further wicked intentions thought to have &s;ea&s;ed vpon &s;ome of his Cava|leers, but the Prince his forces were two for one, being in all about the numbe of 1300 hor&s;e be&s;ids certaine &s;mall quantity of foote which my Lord hearing tooke it to Con&s;ideration whether it were for their &s;afety to march forward or no and as|king the advice of the <HI>Commanders,</HI> put|ting the que&s;tion to the Generall vote of the &s;oudiers, who with and unannimous con&s;ent were more willing to goe for|ward then retire, &s;o that my Lord vnder God &s;till went on, beinge within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the Citty, intellegence was brought his Lord&s;hip that the prince his Cavaleers had ran&s;aked the towne took<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> way all their goods, fired many of the hou&s;es, malitiously trampld downe and beaten down all their C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ne, to the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> prejudice and dammage of the whole coun|trey,
<PB N="3" REF="3">that they intended to returne thither againe to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place very &s;odenly, all which my lord hearing gaue &s;trict charge to the Cheefe men of the Towne by no meanes to let them haue en|trance, which they did, for when the Prince came with his forces the Town &s;tood vp in armes to re&s;i&s;t him in the in|terim my lord of <HI>Stamford</HI> wheeld about him with his forces and &s;o invirond him round, that the prince with mo&s;t of his followers were faine to take water and &s;wim over a great River for the &s;afety of their liues, wherein the cavaleers &s;uffered and were drownded, &s;ome my lord tooke pri&s;ners, whom hee &s;ent vnder a &s;afe guard to be conducted to London where as yet they remaine.</P>
<P>Thus hath the Parliaments party ob|tained the day, and won the victory over the Welch Cavaleers, which I beleeve di|vers of their Country men will take war|ning by them, and learn how to keep with|in their own bounds and liberties.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>Newes is brought over that <HI>Oneale,</HI> Ge|nerall of the Iri&s;h Rebels, had bribed cer|taine poor Prote&s;tants to &s;et on fire <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> the Metropolitane Towne of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that hee him&s;elfe went thither di&s;|gui&s;ed, with &s;ome others to be a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the &s;ame, but his treachery was prevented and divulged by the &s;aid Prote&s;tants, who at their examination confe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, which thing <HI>Oneal</HI> having intelligence of, privately ha&s;tned to his fellow Souldiers.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e joyfull Newes is brought o|ver, that the Rebels are brought to &s;uch a &s;traight, that they mu&s;t very &s;hortly yeeld or peri&s;h, and they would come to com|po&s;ition upon rea&s;onable conditions, of which the&s;e are the chiefe.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, That every man &s;hould have that freedome and &s;cope, as to be of that Religion, as be&s;t agrees to his owne particular con&s;cience (alledging that King</HI> James <HI>did allow of the &s;ame, and that our King</HI> Charles <HI>did not gaine &s;ay it.)</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P><HI>Secondly, that the Parliament here in England &s;hould not proceed over &s;evere again&s;t their ancient Romane Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, that they &s;hould not be lyable to pay any taxation what&s;oever, whether for their Religion, or any temporary accident, but onely what voluntarily they conde&s;cend unto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly, that certaine Lawes &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed and enacted according to their wills, and to be obeyed and kept by none but their Sexaries, namely that none &s;hould be compelled to keep them but they them&s;elves, not excepting others that voluntarily would.</HI></P>
<P>But tis to be noted, that the&s;e Articles were not by the univer&s;all con&s;ent of all the Rebels propounded, for many of them were more re&s;olutely bent to dye in the defence of their Faith; but by &s;ome cer|taine of them that were pend up in a nook by our men, &s;o that they could hardly &s;cape away.</P>
<P>Much malicious and wicked tyranny doe the Rebels u&s;e towards many of our men whom they take pri&s;oners, cutting
<PB N="6" REF="5">out the tongues of &s;ome, &s;caring the mem|bers of others, and mo&s;t inhumanely &s;tran|gling divers by dozens in halters; there|fore I thinke it were not much ami&s;&s;e to give them <HI>Lex Talionis,</HI> and u&s;e them with the like &s;everity here in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince their malicious proceedings is &s;uch again&s;t our Brethren in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Certain joyfull Newes is brought of my Lord of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Encounter with 2. French &s;hips, who after a long cha&s;e he took pri|&s;oners, and received from them great &s;tore of Ammunition, &s;ufficient for 300 men, be|&s;ides the &s;tore of field pieces, all which was thought was intended for His Maje&s;ties a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Honourable Hou&s;es of Parliament. Likewi&s;e there were great &s;tore of Muskets and Pi&s;tols in the &s;aid &s;hips, being hid in fal&s;e Cabines, which by a diligent &s;earch were all found out and &s;ent by his Lord&s;hips command to <HI>Northampton</HI> to my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
