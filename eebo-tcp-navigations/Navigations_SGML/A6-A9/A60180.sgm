<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORK De&s;igned, OR THE SCOTISH ATLAS To be Publi&s;hed.</HEAD>
<P>_AMong&s;t the many Sciences, which perfite and adorn the mind of man, <HI>Geography</HI> is worthy of all prai&s;e: becau&s;e it both affordeth matter of much delight, and likewi&s;e is of much u&s;e for the life of man. This World being a Theater, whereupon each act their Part, and by the &s;everal Per&s;onages, which they repre&s;ent, very much demon&s;trate the marvellous Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s of GOD, who hath contrived all for the perfection of the Univer&s;e his great Work, and by his never erring Providence bringeth all about to the accom|pli&s;hment of his good will and plea&s;ure: Man, who is the le&s;&s;er World and Abridgement of the Greater, cannot but find the advantages of <HI>Geography,</HI> by which we &s;ee all the parts of this great Machine, even which are mo&s;t remote from us, and look upon the&s;e who are ab&s;ent, as if they were pre&s;ent with us. What delight mu&s;t it give us, when we learn by it the Situation of Coun|treys, Towns and Rivers, as well as if we had viewed them with our eyes! It is certain that mo&s;t of men have a great de&s;ire to travell, and it is certainly an inexcu&s;|able fault to be ignorant of what concerneth our own Countrey: Yet many, becau&s;e of their poverty or want of health, are deprived of the&s;e Advantages. And therefore we are much beholden to <HI>Geography,</HI> by which all the face of the World is expo&s;ed to us, and we can even &s;itting at home view the whole Earth and Seas, and much &s;ooner pa&s;s through them in our &s;tudies, than Travellers can do by their Voyages; and &s;o may, without the hazard of being infected by the vices of Forreiners, improve our minds and reap all other Advantages from them. Not to mention here, how the Policy of each place, the &s;tudies of <HI>Theology,</HI> of <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy, Hi&s;tory</HI> and &s;everal Arts may be improved by this knowledge. I &s;hall only in&s;tance in <HI>Merchan|di&s;ing, Navigation</HI> and the Pactice of <HI>Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>And for <HI>Merchandi&s;ing,</HI> (which with <HI>Navigation</HI> is the great &s;upport of corpora|tions) it can hardly be entertained without the knowledge of the Countreys and their Products, of the nature and manners of the Inhabitants and Rodes that lead to them, which the Maps and de&s;criptions joyned to them inform us of; and by the Maps the Mariners come to know the &s;ituation of the Countreys they intend for, the Rout they are to follow and the Dangers they are to be aware of.</P>
<P>As for the Practice of <HI>Medicine, Hippocrates</HI> hath abundantly proven, that a  Phy&s;ician, who would practi&s;e aright, mu&s;t fir&s;t know the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de A&euml;|re, Aquis &amp; Locis.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now con&s;idering the&s;e great u&s;es of <HI>Geographical</HI> De&s;criptions, many complained that there was &s;o little done, as to the De&s;cription of our Countrey: For the <HI>Theater</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> publi&s;hed by <HI>Bleau,</HI> for all its Bulk (except it be the De&s;cription of &s;ome few &s;hires by the learned <HI>Gordon</HI> of <HI>Straloch,</HI> and &s;ome &s;heets of his of the <HI>Scotia</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<HI>Antiqua</HI>) containeth little more than what <HI>Buchanan</HI> wrote, and &s;ome few Scrapes out of <HI>Cambden,</HI> who is no friend to us in what he writeth. And in re&s;pect that there are many I&s;lands around this Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and many impetuous and contrary Currents and Tides, and in &s;everal places the Coa&s;t is full of Rocks, or Banks of &s;and, which ought to be exactly de&s;cribed for the &s;ecurity of Trade. And becau&s;e the face of the Country, by the peace and quiet we enjoy under his <HI>Maje&s;tie's</HI> happy Government, is quite changed from what it was of old; and now for Stately Buildings, Parks, fertile Fields, we begin to contend with the happie&s;t of our Neighbours: therefore a new and full de&s;cription was much de&s;ired by all ingeni|ous per&s;ons.</P>
<P>For the&s;e con&s;iderations His <HI>Sacred Majesty,</HI> the Father of his Countrey, and gra|cious and wi&s;e provi&s;or of all that may be for the profite and honour of it, hath com|manded and ordained, by His Letters patent under the Seal, Sir Robert <HI>Sibbald</HI> one of His Phi&s;icians in ordinary and His <HI>Geographer</HI> for His Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> to publi&s;h an exact de&s;cription of <HI>Scotland Ancient and Modern,</HI> with the Maps. And, that the Maps may be exact and ju&s;t, the Lords of His <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> Pri|vy Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> gave Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>John Adair</HI> Mathematician and skilfull Mechanick, to &s;urvey the Shires. And the &s;aid <HI>John Adair,</HI> by taking the di&s;tances of the &s;everal Angles from the adjacent Hills, hath de&s;igned mo&s;t exact Maps, and hath lately made an <HI>Hydrographical</HI> Map of the River of <HI>Forth</HI> Geometrically &s;urveyed, Wherein, after a new and exact way, are &s;et down all the I&s;les, blind Rocks, Shelves and Sands, with an exact Draught of the Coa&s;ts, with all its Bayes, Head lands, Ports, Havens, Towns, and other things remarkeable; the Depths of the Watters through the whole <HI>Firth,</HI> with the Cour&s;es from each Point, the pro|&s;pect and view of the remarkable I&s;lands, Head-lands, and other con&s;iderable land|marks. And he is next to &s;urvey the Shire of <HI>Perth,</HI> and to make two Maps there|of, one of the &s;outh-&s;ide, and another of the North. He will likewi&s;e be ready to de|&s;ign the maps of the other Shires, that were not done before, providing he may have &s;ufficient allowance therefore. And, that the&s;e, who are concerned, may be the bet|ter per&s;waded thereto, there is joyned with this Account the Map of <HI>Clackmanan-Shire</HI> taken off the Copper-Plate done for it, where may be &s;een not only the Towns, Hills, Rivers and Lochs; but al&s;o the different face of the grounds, which are Ara|ble, and which Moori&s;h: and by convenient Marks you may know the Hou&s;es of the Nobility and Gentry, the Churches, Mills, woods and Parks &amp;c,</P>
<P>In obedience to His <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> command, the &s;aid Sir Robert <HI>Sibbald</HI> printed <HI>Que|ries</HI> for obtaining the Information that was nece&s;&s;ary for the De&s;cription of each Shire; and hath been at the pains to collect &s;everal Manu&s;cripts Ancient and Modern, which may illu&s;trate the &s;aid work; and hath recovered &s;everal Ancient In&s;criptions, which were never publi&s;hed before; and hath now made that advance in the work, that if the re&s;t of the Informations from the Shires be &s;ent in &s;hortly, and the&s;e few Shires be de&s;igned, which are not yet done, this De&s;cription in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (whereof this is the Account) may be very &s;oon ready for the Pre&s;s. For the further encouragement of the&s;e, who may be Sub&s;cribers for the Copies, it is fit there be &s;ome Account of it given, which is as followeth.</P>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>Atlas Scoticus</HI> or <HI>De&s;cription of Scotland Ancient and Modern</HI> is to be in two Volumes; the one in Latin, the other in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Atlas in <HI>Latine</HI> may contain about an hundred printed &s;heets of large <HI>Lum|bard-Paper,</HI> in the great Letter the <HI>Atlas</HI> is u&s;ually done upon: &amp; it will contain &s;ome &s;eventy Maps, whereof there are upwards of twenty more than are in the <HI>Thea|trum Scotiae</HI> done by J. <HI>Bleau</HI>; and of the&s;e &s;everal are exactly &s;urveyed. In this <HI>Lati|ne</HI> Copy the <HI>Scotia Antiqua</HI> will take up more than twenty &s;heets of Print, and is done exactly from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, and the be&s;t Manu&s;cripts and Ancient Records. The contents of the &s;everal Books are &s;et down in the <HI>Latin</HI> Account pre|mi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotia Moderna</HI> likewi&s;e is done in <HI>Latin,</HI> according to the account given there, &s;o it remains that there be ane account given of the <HI>Atlas</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which is to be publi&s;hed fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Atlas</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> may contain eighty &s;heets of printed large <HI>Lum|bard</HI> paper, and about &s;eventy Maps. It is divided into two parts, the General and the &s;pecial part. The General part Containeth the general de&s;cription of
