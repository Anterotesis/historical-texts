<HEAD>THE DECLARATION Of the States of HOLLAND, Concerning the proclaiming of open Wars with the Parliament of England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN my la&s;t of the 25 of March, I acquainted you with the Warlike preparations of the States Gene|ral: &s;ince which time they are plea|&s;ed to &s;et forth a new Edict, prohibiting the tran&s;portation of any Engli&s;h Goods what|&s;oever,
<PB N="4" REF="3">and have declared their di&s;affection to the proceedings of the Engli&s;h, acca&s;ioned by their &s;eizing upon the Flemi&s;h Ve&s;&s;els; in retaliation whereof, they have given &s;trict charge and command, that all &s;hips &amp; goods what&s;oever belonging to the Engli&s;h Nati|on, be forthwith &s;eized upon; as al&s;o al&s;o the Scotti&s;h &s;hips are detained by the Lord High-Admiral Vantrump, who hath decla|red, that according to his Commi&s;&s;ion re|ceived from the high and mighty Lords, the States of Holland, he is re&s;olved to fight all tho&s;e who &s;hall dare to prefume, or attempt the di&s;turbance of the peace and welfare of the freeborn People of the United Provin|ces, &amp;c. As for other matter of intelligence, I &s;hall refer you to the inclo&s;ed, wherein is compri&s;ed &s;everal remarkable pa&s;&s;ages of great concernment, which I conceived re|qui&s;ite to pre&s;ent to publike view, viz.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>The Hollander hath &s;et forth a Declaration to rai&s;e 60000 Hor&s;e and Foot; and 300 Sayl of &s;hips; but their de&s;ign is variou&s;ly &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Yet great are the Conte&s;ts between the Burgo|ma&s;ters and the Bores; for the latter doth threaten to &s;eque&s;ter their E&s;tates, and bring them to a Tryall for their lives, if they will not take a cour&s;e to defend and a&s;&s;i&s;t them at Sea. And &s;ome Tumults and Ri|&s;ings have already been in Zealand, Rotterdam, Dort, Delf, and at the Hague, where many were both &s;lain and wounded, and among&s;t the re&s;t &s;ome Engli&s;h, which the Mutiniers chiefly aymed at, who brand them with the mo&s;t infamous Badge of Tray|tors and Con&s;pirators to their Religion and Liber|ties; &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Duke of Malta hath declared, that he will give his Royal A&s;&s;ent to the Union, and that he will rai&s;e forty thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, to joyn with the Chri&s;tians again&s;t the Turks; and in pur&s;uance thereof hath granted a Commi&s;&s;ion to Prince Fre|derick, Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, to command in chief un|der his Highne&s;s Prince Philips.</P>
<P>It is reported, that Lieu. Col. Lilburn is made Captain of a Man of War for the States of Holland; and that he hath received Power and In&s;tructions, to fire, &s;ink, or take, any &s;hips what&s;oever, that &s;hall be declared Enemies to the United Provinces.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere hath been a great and imperial Coun|cel held at Mun&s;ter in Germany, by the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of 13 Chri&s;tian Kings, Princes, and Dukes; At which Diet, they took into con&s;idera|tion the pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition of many exiled Princes; and among&s;t the re&s;t, a Conference aro&s;e touching the King of Scots; but nothing done therein (at pre&s;ent) by rea&s;on of other weighty and emergent bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, which call them to a Work of far greater concernment; and may al&s;o prove fatal, if not timely prevented: For the Great Turk, and his Ba&s;haw have taken the field with &s;even hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, and are re&s;olved (if po&s;&s;i|ble) to make a great deva&s;tation and inroad upon Chri&s;tendom this Summer: But great is the care of the Emperour of Germany, the 7 Chri&s;tian Princes of Italy, the Queen of Sweden, the Prince of Tran|&s;ilvania, and Prince Frederick of Malta, to rai&s;e a formidable Power, and to unite and joyn with the Venetians, both in an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive War again&s;t the Turks; And in pur&s;uance thereof, a League is concluding between the afore&s;aid Prin|ces; who have had a large con&s;ultation thereupon; But that which is thought mo&s;t requi&s;ite and fea&s;i|ble at pre&s;ent, is, the &s;ending of a Summons to all Chri&s;tendom, for Warlike Provi&s;ions to be made a|gain&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="4">the Enemies thereof; And indeed great rea|&s;on have they &s;o to do; for never was a more po|tent and irre&s;i&s;table Army rai&s;ed the&s;e many years, as now the Turks and Jani&s;aries have rai&s;ed. Yet notwith&s;tanding, Prince Philip (the third Son to the Queen of Bohemia, and General to the Stases of Ve|nice) hath given them a great Overthrow neer the I&s;le of Candia, and kill'd, taken, and routed about three&s;core thou&s;and men: This Overthrow doth exceedingly retard the Enemies De&s;ign; and as it is a great prejudice to them, &s;o it is a great advantage to Chri&s;tendom; And his Highne&s;&s;e Prince Philip hath embraced this opportunity; who by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Divine Power, hath obtained another great Victory again&s;t the Jani&s;aries: Since which Atchievements, he is called Philip the Great; a Gen|tleman of a gallant temper, and endow'd with ex|cellent Properties and Vertues, both for prudence, wi&s;dom, and magnanimity of Spirit: He is even be|come as great a Terrour to the Turks, as Alexander the Great was to the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The King of Scots hath &s;ent the Lord Wilmot with a Me&s;&s;age to the Princes of Italy, imploring Supplies and Accommodation, &s;uitable to his pre|&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities and Condition; but they have re|turned An&s;wer, That by rea&s;on of the home-bred
<PB N="8" REF="5">divi&s;ions they cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t him; but promi&s;e fair when a fea&s;ible opportunity &s;hall &s;erve: which I conjecture may come to pa&s;s about Latter-Lam|ma&s;s. By rea&s;on that we have received &s;ome inclina|tion that the States of Holland have declared for a Union with the Parliament of England; and have Ordered that tho&s;e &s;hips and goods formerly &s;eized on (belonging to the Engli&s;h) be forthwith di&s;|charged and &s;et at liberty. Lieut. Col. Lilburn is very active in &s;tirring up the well-affected Engli&s;h; And &s;ome relate, that he hath &s;ent a Letter to the Lord General, puting his Exceliency in mind of his Prote&s;tation at Huntington; wherein he de&s;ires him to &s;tand up again&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion; to propogate the Go&s;pel; to pre&s;erve the liberty of the People, and to maintain their ju&s;t rights and priviledges.</P>
