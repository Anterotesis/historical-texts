<HEAD>A Brief, but mo&s;t True RELATION Of the late Barbarous and Bloody PLOT Of the <HI>Negro</HI>'s in the I&s;land of BARBADO'S On <HI>Friday</HI> the 21. of <HI>October,</HI> 1692. <HI>To Kill the Governour and all the Planters, and to de&s;troy the Government there E&s;tabli&s;hed, and to &s;et up a New Governour and Government of their own.</HI></HEAD>

<P>_THis day I arrive'd,&mdash;But I had like to come &s;hort of the Governour. For the <HI>Negro</HI>'s in this I&s;land had made a PLOT to have di&s;troy'd all the Chri&s;tians therein: And it was to have been done that very day that we came hither. But as it happen'd, the Night before it was found out very providentially, by Two of them that were a talking of this their wicked De&s;ign; who being fully overheard to di&s;cour&s;e thereof, they were taken up, and Examined, and &s;o
<PB REF="2">frankly confe&s;&s;ed (when it could not be help'd) what their De&s;ign was. Upon which di&s;covery, the Government hath taken up between two and three hundred <HI>Negro</HI>'s: And Tryed and Condem|ed many of them. Of which Number of the Con|demn'd per&s;ons, Many were Hang'd, and a great many Burn'd. And, (for a Terror to others,) there are now &s;even Hanging in Chains, alive, and &s;o Starving to Death. It is reported, they de&s;ign'd to have taken up the Sirnames and Offices of the Principal Planters and men in the I&s;land, to have En&s;laved all the Black men and Women tothem, and to have taken the White Women for their Wives. This PLOT was formed by the <HI>Negro</HI>'s that were born in the I&s;land, and no imported <HI>Negro</HI> was to have been Admitted to partake of the Freedom they intended to gain, till he had been made Free by them, who &s;hould have been their Ma&s;ters. The old Women (both Black and White) were to have been their Cooks, and Servants, in other Capacities. And they had cho&s;en a Governour among them|&s;elves, and every thing was prepared and &s;etled in Readine&s;s for giving the Fatal Stroak. They have been contriving of this Wicked and Bloody de&s;ign this three years, and had &s;o long kept it very &s;ecret until the very day before it was to have been done. But we hope in a little time to &s;ee a Stop fully put to their Contrivance, and the Vil|lains them&s;elves &s;peedily di&s;covered and detected.</P>
