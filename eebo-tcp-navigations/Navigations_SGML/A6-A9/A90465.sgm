<HEAD>A perfect Diurnall of the &s;everall pa&s;|&s;ages in our late journey into Kent, from <HI>Aug. 19.</HI> to <HI>Sept. 3. 1642.</HI> By the appoint|ment of both Hou&s;es of Parliament. Publi&s;hed for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who de&s;ire true Information.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>UPon the nineteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1642. being <HI>Fri|day,</HI> late at evening, there met at <HI>Moore-ditch</HI> &s;ome 200. Troopers well hor&s;ed, and every man fur|ni&s;hed with Armour and Carbines, and &s;ome 300. or thereabouts of Dragoneers, all under the command of Colonel <HI>Sands,</HI> Generall of the Army for that ex|pedition, Sir <HI>Jahn Seatone,</HI> Sir <HI>Miles Lucy,</HI> and Captain <HI>Lee,</HI> being Commi&s;&s;ioners or Coun&s;ellers, together with Col: <HI>Sands,</HI> for the ordering and appointing of the &s;ouldiers their &s;everall and particular &s;ervices, ac|cording to the place, time and per&s;ons appointed by them to goe, as they received in&s;tructions, and power from the Parliament for the peace and &s;afety of the whole Kingdome.</P>
<P>We marched all Friday night, and Saterday mor|ning, and re&s;ted not till we came to <HI>Dartford,</HI> which was about eight of the clock in the morning, where we baited 2. or 3. houres. After that time when we were gathered together by the &s;ound of a Trumpet, we advanced forward in our journey untill we came to the way which turned to <HI>Cobham-hall:</HI> Then the Colonel cho&s;e out &s;ome Dragooners to &s;earch <HI>Cob|ham-hall,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y"> for we heard they were mightily provided again&s;t: Yet this nothing at all di&s;heartned us, but we (making all ready for our own defence, and the &s;afety of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Parliament,</HI> who&s;e &s;ervice we went about) marched forwards until we came to the place: when we were come, the Lady through feare &s;ent out word to us, that we &s;hould have the Magazine delive|red unto us, which when we had it, we loaded 5. wag|gons, and &s;ent them to London, and took three war-hor&s;es.</P>
<P>When our company the &s;ame day was thus divi|ded, the re&s;t advanced forwards, untill we came to <HI>Strood,</HI> neer <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> where we heard of great prepa|rations making again&s;t us, then we had command with all &s;peed to make ready for our own defence, at which preparation one of our &s;ouldiers pi&s;tols acci|dentally went off, and &s;hot his fellow quite through, Armour and all, and hurt another, which we beleeve was the occa&s;ion of a fal&s;e report &s;ent to London, that halfe our company were &s;laine.</P>
<P>And when we had prepared our &s;elves by way of defence, then the Col: divided our company, one part for <HI>Roche&s;ter bridge,</HI> where we did expect a pitcht battail by all relations, we meeting divers of the Gen|try with their wives behind them on hor&s;eback, as we conceived for feare of the skirmi&s;h. Then came out Col: <HI>Sands</HI> from the parlie which he had with &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates, &s;aying to his Captains, There is no way but one, Win it and weare it, make ready fellow &s;ouldiers. The Captains demanded which &s;hould goe forward, whereupon the Col: comman|ded about 40. Dragoons to goe fir&s;t, and &s;ome Troo|pers to follow after, but the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was quickly en|ded,
<PB N="3" REF="2"> the bridge yeelded up &amp; unchained. When this was done, our Col: commanded centinel to be kept upon the bridge, to keep any from pa&s;&s;ing to and fro, but &s;uch as could give a ju&s;t account whither they went. Now while centinel was thus &s;trictly kept, the Lord <HI>Roper</HI> (which for the pre&s;ent was both unknown and unexpected, though in time convenient was intended to be &s;ought after) came in his Coach with his Lady and other Gentlewo|men, and a Sumpter-hor&s;e following the Coach, both which were commanded to &s;tand, and &s;tay the Colonels plea&s;ure, untill he came from <HI>Upnall Ca&s;tle,</HI> which was 3. miles from Roche&s;ter, for after he had &s;et centinel upon the bridge, he went with the re&s;t of the Troops and Dra|gooners to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;tle. When he came, we found no great &s;hevv of re&s;i&s;tance, for tho&s;e who u&s;ually attended the Captain for defence of the Ca&s;tle, were mo&s;t or all of them forth at harve&s;t; when they heard news of our comming, they made ha&s;te to come in, but it was too late, for we &s;topped them by the way. The Colonel marched up to the gate of the Ca&s;tle with &s;ome few men to enter in, none daring to re&s;i&s;t. We took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;tle, which &s;tood clo&s;e by the &s;ea &s;ide, (the Captain was playing at bowls) and left a &s;uffi|cient guard to keep it. Then we took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd left a &s;ufficient guard there, and then returned back to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and entred the City with peace, and took with us the Lord <HI>Roper,</HI> and lodged him at the Crown, with a &s;trong guard day and night. But before we were di&s;charged from the &s;ervice of that day, we went with our Col: to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chattam Dock,</HI> where the Kingdomes &s;tore-hou&s;e is; in which place lyeth &s;ome 300. Peeces of Ordnance, 60. whereof are bra&s;&s;e Peeces, be&s;ides 30. or 40. peeces of Ordn. which are at <HI>Vpnall Ca&s;tle.</HI> The Ammunition which is in the
<PB N="4" REF="3"> &s;tore-hou&s;e was to be conveyed away that night, if we had not then taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Some of us were con|&s;trained to watch all that night, though we travailed all the night before. But &s;uch was the love of tho&s;e who li|ved in <HI>Chattam,</HI> manife&s;ted to us, that they brought great &s;tore of food to us, in &s;uch plenty, as &s;erved us the next day after, and would not &s;uffer us to pay for it, &amp; made us very welcome &s;o long as we &s;tayed, &amp; were very &s;or|ry when we went away. We cannot &s;ay we found &s;uch love in <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> they both not being far di&s;tant one fro~ the other.</P>
<P><HI>Now here we are to give the Reader to under&s;tand, that up|on a fal&s;e report which was carryed to London concerning half our company being &s;laine, Captaine</HI> Browne <HI>and &s;ome of his company came after that work was done to help us on Saterday night, and Capt.</HI> Chapman <HI>and &s;ome of his company came the night after them, and Cap.</HI> Banes, <HI>&amp; many other of our friends came to &s;ee us, for which we are much obliged to them for their care of us, and love to us, in that they came to put their &s;houl|ders to the work with us.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>On Munday being the 22. of the &s;ame month, &s;ome of our company by the command of our Col: &s;allied forth to &s;earch the hou&s;e of Ma&s;ter <HI>Littleboy,</HI> his wife &amp; daugh|ter being Recu&s;ants, &s;ome of our &s;ouldiers (after they had &s;earched the lower part of the hou&s;e) went up to the highe&s;t place of one part of it, and there they found the place where Mrs. <HI>Littleboy</HI> and her daughter wor&s;hiped the picture of the Queen of heaven, and the Crucifixe, which was pictured upon the rafters of the hou&s;e, for it vvas not &s;eiled, vvhich pictures they took avvay, vvith &s;ome other Popi&s;h books, and broke dovvn their Altar: but we found no Ammunition nor money. We &s;earched up and dovvn for vaults and caves, but found none. After
<PB N="5" REF="3"> a little time of di&s;cour&s;e vvith her daughter, vve finding none el&s;e but &s;he in the hou&s;e, and &s;ome fevv &s;ervants, when vve had refre&s;hed our &s;elves with vvhat their free gift vvas now to be&s;tovv upon as, vve peaceably de|parted.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day morning vve guarded the Lord <HI>Roper</HI> from the Crowne at <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Vpnall</HI> Ca&s;tle, and there left him w^t^h a &s;trong guard of a roote company which came on munday from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> which being done, we all being mounted, marched after our Col: a little beyond <HI>Chattam,</HI> and boarded the great &s;hip called the <HI>Soveraigne,</HI> and the &s;hip called the <HI>Prince Royall,</HI> aad left a &s;ufficient guard in each of them, and there returned to Roche&s;ter and there quartered all that night.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day being Bartholmevv day, before vve marched forth &s;ome of our &s;ouldiers (remembring their Prote&s;tation which they tooke) went to the Cathedrall about 9. or 10. of the clock, in the mid&s;t of their &s;uper|&s;titious wor&s;hip, with their &s;inging men and boyes, they (ovving them no reverence) marched up to the place where the Altar &s;tood, and &s;taying awhile, thinking they vvould then have ea&s;ed their wor&s;hip, and demanded a rea&s;on of their po&s;ture, but &s;eeing they did not, the &s;oul|diers could not forbeare any longer to vvait upon their plea&s;ure, but vvent about their vvorke they came for. Fir&s;t they removed the Table to its place appointed, &amp; then tooke the &s;eate which it &s;tood upon being made of deale board, having two or three &s;teps to goe up to the Altar, &amp; brake that all to pieces, it &s;eems the Altar was &s;o holy, that the ground was not holy enough to &s;tand up|on: This being done, they pluckt down the rails, and left them for the poore to kindle their fires; and &s;o left the Organs to be pluckt downe till we came back again, but it appeared before we came back they tooke
<PB N="6" REF="4"> them downe them&s;elves. When this work vvas fini&s;hed. we then advanced towards <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> but in the mid&s;t of our way we came to Sir <HI>Peter Recaults</HI> hou&s;e, a place where Sir <HI>Edward Deering</HI> and the re&s;t of that faction met concerning the &s;et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of the Commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Array,</HI> we found Sir <HI>Peter</HI> but not Sir <HI>Edward</HI> in his hou&s;e, wee found and brought away with him in and about his Coach good &s;tore of money and a trunke full of Plate, which was di&s;covered by one of his maids, which when the old Lady heard who di&s;covered it, &s;hee threatned to be the death of her; whereupon our Col: Commanded her to be brought away; and carried in the coach where our engins was, and &s;o &s;hee was pre&s;erved from that ac|cident. The foure hor&s;es which drew Sir <HI>Peter</HI> to <HI>Vpnall</HI> Ca&s;tle to keepe the L. <HI>Roper</HI> company, were afterwards employed in &s;ervice for the &s;afety of the King and Parl: but before we employed the hor&s;es or the coach in &s;uch a &s;ervice, we brought the coach &amp; 4. hor&s;es that night to <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> with us, and whil&s;t we were bu&s;ie about &s;etting up of our hor&s;es, the coach man got through a back way in the Inne with his coach &amp; &s;o made an e&s;cape, and rid away &s;o fa&s;t, that we had much adoe to overtake him, and lay hold on him, but when we had him, we bound him with match, and brought him back to <HI>Maid&s;tone.</HI> There was another of Sir <HI>Peters</HI> Servants which gave out malignant &s;peeches again&s;t the Parliament, which by the command of our Colonel we bound, and laid upon the hedge, with an intent to puni&s;h him, and bring him away pri&s;oner; but that Sir <HI>Peter</HI> pa&s;&s;ed his word for his forth|comming.</P>
<P>This night we &s;allied out to Sir <HI>William Butlers</HI> hou&s;e, there having &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance &s;hot open the door; but Sir <HI>William</HI> was not to be found, we &s;earched the hou&s;e, and found three bags of money under the ruffe of the hou&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="4"> and another under a kettle. Whereupon our Col: demanded of one of his men &s;ervants, where the private vaults were, the fellow &s;hewed our Col: the hou&s;e of office. Afterwards we found divers muskets in the hou&s;e, ready laden with bul|lets, be&s;ides halfe pikes, holper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, bows, and other ammunition, two hor&s;es, and divers Papi&s;t books and pictures, and brought all away with us to Maid&s;tone, and quartered there that night, where we found the malignant party &s;hut up their &s;hops for feare of us.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day we advanced towards Canterbury, where by the way we vi&s;ited Sir <HI>Robert Dorrell,</HI> and &s;earched his hou&s;e, onely for Sir <HI>Edward D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ering,</HI> and then our company was divided; &s;ome of our &s;ouldiers &s;allied forth the &s;ame time to &s;earch Sir <HI>Edward Deerings</HI> hou&s;e, and others to the Earl of Thanet, Fir&s;t when we came to Sir <HI>Edwards</HI> hou&s;e, the Lady and Mr. <HI>Henry Deering</HI> made us welcome, whether it was out of feare or love we know not: and when we &s;earched the hou&s;e, we found 100. li. in money, and &s;ome ammunition, and there &s;tayed all night. And then the other part of our company &s;allied forth to the Earle of Thanet, where we en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">red the hou&s;e without any re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;earch|ed, where we found good &s;tore of Ammunition, both pikes, armour, head-pieces, &s;words, gunpowder, bullets, and match, but not one Musket. When we had done &s;earching, we quartered that night in the hou&s;e, in a faire kitchen, by a good fire, there we had &s;uch provi&s;ion as the hou&s;e could afford.</P>
<P>The next morning being Friday, (we were glad when we &s;aw the light ap|peare, becau&s;e we had but hard lodging, &s;ome in chairs, and the re&s;t upon the dre&s;&s;er boords, except one or two who got into a bed) our Col: &s;ent a wagon to be loaden with the Ammunition. When that was done, we gave full &s;atisfaction for what provi&s;ion we had, and then mounted upon our hor&s;es, and marched a|way with the waggon to <HI>A&s;hford,</HI> where we met the re&s;t of our company, and there we bay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed for an houre or two, which time the bells rung for joy. Then we advanced towards <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but before we came thither, our company againe was divided, one part went forward, and the re&s;t came after with the waggon. It was night before we got to <HI>Canterbury</HI> with our waggon, where we met with the re&s;t of our company, and were all very joyfully entertained, with &s;uch re&s;pect, that the people &s;houted for joy at our fir&s;t entrance, and there we quartered that night.</P>
<P>On Saterday morning before we departed, &s;ome of our &s;ouldiers vi&s;ited the great Cathedrall, and made havock of all their Popi&s;h reliques, and got into the &s;hriving roome, where they took away a whip which whipt the Papi&s;ts at &s;ome certaine time of the yeere. When they had done their plea&s;ure, we all marched to <HI>Dover,</HI> and came thither by 3. or 4. a clock in the afternoone, and when we were entring into the towne, the Ca&s;tle welcomed us in with 3. volley &s;hot of Ordnance charged with Bullets, which &s;ang &s;weetly over our heads, for the town, yet &s;tood in a valley. We being entred we were not welcome by mo&s;t of the town, yet we cared not for that, &s;o long as we had money to pay for what we wanted: there we &s;earched onely the hou&s;es of tho&s;e who were malignants, where we found good &s;tore of money and ammunition. But &s;trangers that &s;ojourned there, wee medled not with them, onely we took from our home-&s;pun enemies, and quarte|red there all Sabbath day. And while we lay there, a fal&s;e relation of our pro|ceedings w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ent to London, bearing date the 29. Aug.</P>
<P>On Munday morning being the 29. of Aug. Col: <HI>Sands</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Deale Ca&s;tle, and left a &s;ufficient guard in it for defence of the King and Parl. other part of our company went aboard of the <HI>Lord of Warwicks &s;hip,</HI> where his
<PB REF="5"> Lord&s;hip mo&s;t royally and joyfully entertained us, being very glad to &s;ee us.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day &s;ome of our company &s;allied out to the deane of <HI>Canterbury</HI> where we found <HI>Borgraves</HI> &s;on a &s;wearing damming fellow; we found no Arms but onely &s;ome Gun-powder which was hid in the top of the hou&s;e. After the &s;earching the Deanes hou&s;e, we marched to Colonell <HI>Hamonds</HI> Unkle, whom we brought along with us to Dover, and there left him pri&s;oner in the Gaole.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day our company was divided; one part marched towards Canterbu|ry again, and the other towards Hide, where we vi&s;ited a Ca&s;tle betwixt Dover and Hide, and &s;o quartered that night at Hide.</P>
<P><HI>On Wedne&s;day, part of our company advanced towards</HI> Fever&s;ham <HI>where we &s;earched by the way at</HI> Bouton <HI>a Papi&s;ts hou&s;e, but found nothing. Than wee came to</HI> Fever&s;ham, <HI>and in Pre&s;ton &s;treete at the entera ce of the Towne wee &s;earcht another Papi&s;ts hou&s;e, where we found a co&s;let and other old furniture, and a great Cro&s;&s;e, and then we marched into the Towne, where we were loving|ly entertained by the trained bond, who gave us two valley &s;hots, and we an|&s;wered them the like and &s;o departed and ma ched to</HI> Link&s;tead <HI>to the Lord</HI> Ropers <HI>hou&s;e and &s;earched it, where we found no Armes but &s;ome plate, to the value of</HI> 50. <HI>or</HI> 60. <HI>pounds worth: we were kindely entertained and &s;o departed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On Thur&s;day morning being the</HI> 1. <HI>Sept. before we departed, there was a Bar|ber and a Tap&s;ter expre&s;&s;ing inveterate &s;peeches again&s;t the Parl. and us His Ma|je&s;ties good Subjects. We laid hands on them, and bound them back to back, and &s;et them upon a ho &s;e, and rode them through the town to our Colonel, and after that through the town again, and then &s;lipt a halter about each of their necks, and carryed them to the gallows, and there wi&s;hed them to prepare them&s;elves, which while</HI> they <HI>were &s;o doing, a Trumpeter (one of our own appointing) came riding Po&s;te with a Reprieve for them, and &s;o the halters were out, and their lives &s;aved for the pre&s;ent. After this was done, we re-advanced to Maid&s;tone, and there quartered that night.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On Friday morning before we departed from thence, the town being troubled with &s;ome malignant &s;pirits, who burned &s;o inwardly with malice and hatred, that they could no longer forbeare, began to &s;peak malignant words again&s;t the Par. the &s;ame night we came into the town, and abu&s;ed one of our company. But the next morning we &s;erved him as we had done the others at</HI> Tenderden. <HI>Be&s;ides we took another fellow in</HI> Maid&s;tone, <HI>who &s;tood for the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array, who wi&s;hed all their heads off that would not obey it. We produced witne&s;&s;es to prove what he &s;aid, &amp; examined the witne&s;&s;es before a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and &s;o brought him along with us, to be left to the Parl.</HI></P>
<P>This being done, and our &s;ervice for that time almo&s;t expired, we returned to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> again, where we marched again to <HI>Vpnall</HI> Ca&s;tle, and vi&s;ited the Lord <HI>Roper,</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Peter Ricault,</HI> who made us welcome: After which time we garded them from the Ca&s;tle to the Crowne at <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and when order was taken for their &s;afe conveyance by water, we &s;tayed no longer there but mar|ched that night to Graves-end, and when the Deane of Canterbury thought all was &s;ecure and we departed, &s;ome of our company tooke him as he was go|ing to bed at the crowne in Roche&s;ter, which when he was apprehended we &s;ent him to Graves end to be &s;ent to London with the Lord <HI>Roper</HI> and Sir <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>On Saturday we all met together at Dedford, and &s;o marched home to Lon|don, where we found the welcomme&s;t place.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant of a bla&s;phemous pamphlet again&s;t God, and &s;canda|lous again&s;t our proceedings in Kent; compo&s;ed by Doct: <HI>Paske,</HI> for the doing wherof we refer him to the wi&s;dome of the Parliament.</P>
