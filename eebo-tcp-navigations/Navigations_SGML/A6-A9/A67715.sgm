<HEAD>The Prooeme:</HEAD>
<P>_I Entred &s;ometimes into this &s;erious cogitation: How many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Popular States or free States mena|ged by the peo|ple.</NOTE> Democraties haue been &s;ubuerted by tho&s;e who would needes gouerne the Common-wealth, otherwi&s;e than in a popular State.

How many per&s;ons likewi&s;e who attempted as ab&s;olute Princes to reigne, were either very &s;oone vtterly ouerthrowne; or el&s;e if they ruled any while, held in great admiration, as pa&s;&s;ing wi&s;e men and fortunate. Me thought againe, I had ob&s;erued thus much, That whereas in private fa|milies, &s;ome ma&s;ters haue many &s;eruants in hou&s;hold, others very few: yet even tho&s;e few they could never have wholly at commaund. I con&s;idered moreouer, that as the feeders of Neate and Hor&s;es, &s;o all others bearing the name of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Heardmen.</NOTE> Pa&s;tors, may by good right bee reputed the Commaunders of &s;uch bea&s;ts as they have vnder their hands. But withall, I perceived evidently, that all the&s;e Heards are more willing to obey their Pa&s;tours, than men their Magi&s;trates. For, the &s;aid Heards go whither|&s;oeuer their Heardmen direct them; and as they gladly graze in tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Pa&s;ture.</NOTE> grounds to which they are by them driuen; &s;o they forbeare &s;uch, as they debarre them fro. And verily, they &s;uffer their &s;aid Pa&s;tours to v&s;e at their owne plea&s;ure, tho&s;e profits that ari&s;e from them. Neither have we ever knowne any &s;uch Heards to have ri&s;en rebelliou&s;ly again&s;t their Pa&s;tours, either by way of di&s;obedience, or in denying them the v&s;e of their fruits. Nay rather, more cur&s;t and hurtfull are bea&s;ts to all others
<PB N="2" REF="11">whom&s;oever, than to their Rulers and tho&s;e who receive commodity by them: whereas contrariwi&s;e, Men &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t none more, than &s;uch as they per|ceiue, goe about to exerci&s;e dominion ouer them. When I had well pondered the&s;e points in my minde, thus I concluded in the end, That more ea&s;ie it was for a man to command all other living creatures in the world, than men.</P>
<P>But when I con&s;idered eft&s;oones, How <HI>Cyrus</HI> a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> borne, had won exceeding many men, very many Cities, and Nations likewi&s;e, to his obedience, I was thereby enforced to change my former opinion, and thus to re&s;olve at the la&s;t; That it is nei|ther impo&s;&s;ible, nor yet a matter of difficulty, to governe men, in ca&s;e one have the skill thereof, and goe about it with dexterity. For why? of this we are a&s;&s;ured, that there yeelded obei&s;ance willingly vnto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;ome who were many dayes, others as many moneths iourney, di&s;tant from him: tho&s;e that never &s;aw him, yea and &s;uch as knew full well they &s;hould never &s;ee him: yet nathele&s;&s;e would they all become his liege men and devoted &s;ubiects. And no maruell. For, &s;o farre excelled he all other Kings, as well tho&s;e that by inheritance &s;ucceeded in their Fathers Kingdomes, as tho&s;e who by their owne conque&s;t attained to their dominions; that whereas the <HI>Scythian</HI> King, (albeit the <HI>Scythians</HI> be a State, for number of people mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant) is not able to command any forraine Nation; but would be well apaid, if he might but rule his owne: The <HI>Thracian</HI> Prince, likewi&s;e the <HI>Thracians:</HI> and the <HI>Illyrian</HI> Poten|tate, the <HI>Illyrians:</HI> which is the ca&s;e, as we heare &s;ay, of other Countries be&s;ides; (For in <HI>Europe,</HI> the people live by report &s;everally vnder their owne lawes, and remaine hi|therto, free one from another) <HI>Cyrus</HI> alone, who found the States of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> likewi&s;e ru|led by their owne lawes, having with a &s;mall Army of <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> made an inva&s;ion, be|came Soueraigne Lord verily of the <HI>Medes,</HI> and the <HI>Hyrcanians,</HI> without re&s;i&s;tance, as who willingly raunged them&s;elves vnto him: But the <HI>Syrians, A&s;&s;yrians, Arabi|ans, Cappadocians,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of the grea|ter Phrygia and the le&s;&s;e.

In which regard, I haue diligently enquired tou|ching this Prince, as of a man worthy to be admired: and namely, how he was by birth de&s;cended? what his naturall di&s;po&s;ition was? what manner of education hee had? that he &s;o farre &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all men in princely government.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The cu&s;tome of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in government of their Natives. How <HI>Cyrus</HI> was in&s;ti|tuted during his Child-hood in the di&s;cipline of vertue, with other children of his age, in the publike Schooles.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CYrus</HI> verily (by report) had for his Father, <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> King of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> (now was this <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> lineally de&s;cended from the <HI>Per&s;idae,</HI> which take their name of <HI>Per&s;eus.</HI>) And his Mother, all writers agree to have beene, <HI>Mandane,</HI> the daughter of <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> King of the <HI>Medes.</HI> The common &s;peech is, and among the <HI>Barbarians</HI> rife it is even at this day in every mans mouth, That <HI>Cyrus</HI> naturally for his outward countenance was very faire and well fauoured, and for the inward endu|ments of his minde, mo&s;t courteous, pa&s;&s;ing &s;tudious, and exceeding de&s;irous of ho|nour: in&s;omuch as for to win prai&s;e, he would refu&s;e no paines, but vndergoe all pe|rils what&s;oeuer. <HI>Cyrus</HI> being thus by nature, endued with rare gifts of the minde, and adorned with beauty of body al&s;o, (according as we find in written records:) was trained vp be&s;ides, in the lawes of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> Lawes, (to &s;ay a truth) which &s;eeme even at the very fir&s;t to provide for the weale publike. Neither goe they that way to worke, nor begin there, as in many States they doe. For, the mo&s;t part of other Com|mon-wealths, permitting every man to bring vp his owne children as he li&s;t, and &s;uf|fering the elder &s;ort them&s;elves to lead what life they will, ordaine afterwards and commaund them [in this wi&s;e] <HI>Not to &s;teale: Not to rob: To breake into no mans hou&s;e by violence, nor to &s;trike any per&s;on wrongfully: Not to commit Adultery: Not to be di&s;obedient to the Magi&s;trate,</HI> and &s;emblably other [Edicts they publi&s;h] of like nature. And looke, who tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth any of the&s;e Ordinances, they impo&s;e a penalty vpon him. But the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> lawes by good fore&s;ight take order, that no natiue of theirs &s;hould at the fir&s;t be &s;o affected, as to commit any foule and di&s;hone&s;t fact.</P>
<P>They haue among&s;t them a common place of free re&s;ort (as they tearme it,) where the Kings Palace, with the other &s;tately Courts are erected: from whence, all Mer|chandizing, al mercate folke with their clamorous noi&s;es and trifling fooleries, are dri|ven into another place; to the end, that the vnruly and ba&s;e multitude of &s;uch as they are, might not be intermingled with the civill order of tho&s;e, who have had good breeding.</P>
<P>This common<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or place.</NOTE> Hall &s;ituate about the Courts and Edifices afore-&s;aid, is diuided into foure quarters. Of which, one is [appointed] for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or boyes.</NOTE> children, another for young men, a third for men of middle age; and the la&s;t for &s;uch, as by rea&s;on of their yeeres be ex|empt from warre-fare. Now, by order of law, prouided it is; that every of the&s;e &s;hould pre&s;ent them&s;elves in their owne &s;everall quarters. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or boyes.</NOTE> children, and they who be at mens e&s;tate, by the breake of day: But the elder &s;ort, when they be&s;t may and &s;ee their times; vnle&s;&s;e it be vpon certaine &s;et daies, when they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity give attendance. As for the young men, they al&s;o lye about the Courts afore&s;aid with tho&s;e armes which they are trained with, except &s;uch as be married: And the&s;e verily are not &s;o much as enquired for, vnle&s;&s;e they had e&s;peciall warning before to wait. Howbeit, for them al&s;o to be often ab&s;ent, is not commendable. For every one of the&s;e diui&s;ions, there be 12. Provo&s;ts (according as the whole nation of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> is diui|ded into 12.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Shir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> Tribes. Children or boies, are vnder the charge of certaine choi&s;e men of the elders, &s;uch as are thought fit to make them mo&s;t vertuous and hone&s;t. Over
<PB N="4" REF="12">the young men, are appointed tho&s;e of middle age, &s;uch as &s;eeme &s;ufficient to bring them to be&s;t proufe and perfection. The men al&s;o of ripe and compleat yeers, have for their over&s;eers tho&s;e, who are deemed able &s;o to in&s;truct them, as they may per|forme tho&s;e things mo&s;t of all, which are pre&s;cribed unto them, and commanded by the Soveraigne Magi&s;trate. The Auncients likewi&s;e are not without their Pre&s;idents cho&s;en of purpo&s;e to rule them, and to give direction, that even they al&s;o may execute their duties. And verily, what &s;euerall functions are appointed for euery age to be employed in, I will declare in particular, that it may the better appeare, how diligent they be, and what cour&s;e they take, that their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Natives.</NOTE> Citizens may prooue right hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, children.</NOTE> boyes then, ordinarily frequenting their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">: Or Schoole-ma&s;ters hou&s;es.</NOTE> Schooles, &s;pend the time in lear|ning Iu&s;tice: and they give it out, that for this purpo&s;e, they goe thither: like as with vs they doe, who are to learne their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Grammar</NOTE> letters. As for their Governours, they be&s;tow the mo&s;t part of the day, in mini&s;tring Iu&s;tice among them. For, even the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, young|lings.</NOTE> boyes after the manner of men, frame their enditements and actions one again&s;t ano|ther, of <HI>Theft, Robbery, Violence, Deceit, Slanderous or reprochfull words,</HI> and &s;uch like v&s;uall ca&s;es. And who&s;oeuer be found delinquent in any of the&s;e crimes, puni&s;hed they are. Tho&s;e al&s;o they cha&s;ti&s;e, whom they take accu&s;ing others without iu&s;t cau&s;e. Moreover, they call iudicially into que&s;tion that crime, for which, men hate indeed one another mo&s;t, yet never que&s;tion any therefore, And that is Ingratitude. And whom&s;oever they vnder&s;tand able to requite a good turne, and yet &s;hort in requitall, him they &s;harply puni&s;h: For this they thinke, That vnthankefull per&s;ons, are of all others mo&s;t negligent likewi&s;e in their duty to God, to their parents, to their Coun|trey al&s;o and to their friends. Yea and it &s;eemeth, that vnthankefulne&s;&s;e is accompa|nied e&s;pecially with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Impudence.</NOTE> vn&s;hamefacedne&s;&s;e: And this vice verily is thought to be the head-Mi&s;tris that leadeth to all lewdne&s;&s;e and villany. Moreouer, they teach the&s;e boyes temperance: And much furthered are they in learning &s;uch moderation, for that they &s;ee before their faces, even the Auncients every day, to live right temperate|ly. Furthermore, they give them precepts to obey their Rulers. In which point al&s;o it auaileth much, that they behold the very Elders, pa&s;&s;ing obedient to the high|er powers: Semblably, they in&s;truct them to bee &s;pary in their meats and drinks: wherein al&s;o they have a great helpe; partly becau&s;e they have before their eyes the example of the Seniours, who depart not vnto their refection before the Magi&s;trates giue them leaue; and in part, for that the children them&s;elves feed not at home with their mothers, but with their Ma&s;ters, and when the Provo&s;ts doe &s;o appoint: Now they bring with them from home for their &s;tanding food, bread: and for their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Or, Pitance.</NOTE> cates be&s;ide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of which the Iri&s;h Sham|rogth are a kinde.</NOTE> cre&s;&s;es; And if any of them be athir&s;t; he hath an earthen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Godet.</NOTE> pot wherewith to clitch vp water out of the running riuer. Furthermore, they learne to &s;hoot and dart. Thus you &s;ee, what the boyes practi&s;e, vntill they be &s;ixteene or &s;eventeene yeers of age.</P>
<P>After this time, raunged they are among the young men: and the&s;e be imployed and doe live in this manner: For ten yeers immediately after their childhood, they lie by night (as is afore&s;aid) about the Kings Palace and other Courts, as well for the guard of the publike State, as for the exerci&s;e of temperance; (For, this age &s;eemeth to have mo&s;t need of carefull tending and governance) but in the day-time they &s;hew them&s;elves principally to the Magi&s;trates, if haply there be &s;ome &s;ervice to bee done for the Common-wealth. And when&s;oever need requireth, they all give attendance a|bout the Palaces and Courts afore&s;aid. But when the King goeth forth on hunting (and
<PB N="5" REF="12">that doth he often euery moneth) hee leaueth behinde him halfe of this Guard: And they that goe out with him, mu&s;t have with them, a bow and arrowes with a quiver, a &s;hort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, skein.</NOTE> Falchion in a &s;cabbard, or el&s;e a battell-Axe; a light Buckler be&s;ides, and two Iauelins: the one to launce afar off, the other to v&s;e if need be, clo&s;e at hand-fight. Now why they practi&s;e hunting in publike; and wherefore the King in per&s;on is their Lea|der, as in time of warre, (for he both hunteth him&s;elfe, and al&s;o taketh order that others al&s;o &s;hould hunt;) the rea&s;on is; becau&s;e this exerci&s;e &s;eemeth to bee an exerci&s;e that mo&s;t truly doth re&s;emble warfare. For it inureth them to ri&s;e early in the morning, and to endure both heate and cold: it traineth them to travell on foote in their march, yea and to run. Againe, of nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t &s;hoot and dart at the wilde bea&s;t where|&s;oeuer he hapneth to encounter them: yea and oftentimes in hunting, their courage can not chu&s;e but be quickned and whetted, namely, when any of the&s;e fell bea&s;ts &s;hall be pre&s;ented vnto them. For when the &s;ame approacheth neere, &s;trike they mu&s;t: and withall, in any wi&s;e avoid &s;uch as violently make head. So that all things con&s;idered, there cannot lightly be any feat in warre, which is not &s;eene in this wilde cha&s;e. When the&s;e goe forth on hunting, they haue for their dinner a larger allowance &s;omewhat, as good rea&s;on is, than the Boyes have, howbeit in other re&s;pects alike. During the time that they be hunting, dine they may not: and &s;ay it fall out &s;o, that they mu&s;t &s;tay long for the game, or that they will for their plea&s;ure otherwi&s;e, continue the cha&s;e, and tarry by it &s;till: with this their dinners allowance, they make their &s;upper, and the morrow after, hunt all day vntill &s;upper-time: and &s;o the&s;e two dayes they reckon but for one, becau&s;e they &s;pend but one dayes proportion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, of bread.</NOTE> of food. Which they doe of purpo&s;e, to accu&s;tome them&s;elues, that if the like occa&s;ion &s;hould happen in warre, they might bee able to performe the &s;ame. And looke what veni&s;on they of this age and growth get, that have they for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, pittance.</NOTE> Cates to their bread: but if they &s;peed not, they mu&s;t take vp with bare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">be&s;ides bread.</NOTE> Cre&s;&s;es. Now if any man thinke they haue no plea&s;ure in feeding thus, becau&s;e Cre&s;&s;es be their onely Cates to their bread, and as little in drin|king, for that they drinke nothing but &s;heere water, let him remember, how &s;avory is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Some take it for meale with water and oyle: others, for thick gruell of meale and milke: others al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o for bisket bread.</NOTE> barly meale and dry bread to him that is hungry: and how &s;weet it is to drink &s;heere water when a man is dry. As for the&s;e companies which remaine at home, among other exerci&s;es that they practi&s;ed when they were boyes, they give them&s;elues to the feate of &s;hooting and darting. In making matches al&s;o continually and &s;triuing one to excell another, they &s;pend the time. There be al&s;o certain publique games for the&s;e ma&s;teries; and prizes withall propo&s;ed for the winners. And in what Tribe there proue to bee the greate&s;t number, of mo&s;t skilfull, hardy and tru&s;ty per&s;ons in this kinde, their Provo&s;t not onely for the time being, but hee al&s;o who trained them vp in their boyes age, is highly prai&s;ed and honoured of the people therefore. Moreover, the&s;e young men, who tarry at home, the Magi&s;trates &s;till employ, in ca&s;e there be need of any guard, or of &s;erch for the finding out of malefactors, likewi&s;e of heui-and cry for the intercepting or apprehen&s;ion of theeves: and in one word, about the execution of any &s;ervice that requireth either maine &s;trength or &s;peedy expedition. Thus much of young men and their imployments.</P>
<P>Now after they haue pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e ten yeeres in this wi&s;e, they come to be reckoned men of perfect age: and &s;o for the &s;pace of fiue and twenty yeeres from this their youth forward, they &s;pend after this manner: At the fir&s;t they give attendance as the young men did vpon the Magi&s;trates: what need &s;oeuer the Common-wealth hath, of &s;uch &s;ervice e&s;pecially, as is to be performed by tho&s;e that are both for wi&s;dome and know|ledge and al&s;o for courage and &s;trength yet &s;ufficient. And if they mu&s;t vpon &s;ome
<PB N="6" REF="13">occa&s;ion goe to the warres, the&s;e men who have thus farre proceeded, v&s;e no more ei|ther bowes and arrowes, or darts and javelins to be launted from them, but &s;uch wea|pons and armour as be called <GAP DESC="foreign">. i. meet for clo&s;e fight, to wit, wearing a cuirace for the defence of the bre&s;t, &amp; bearing in their left hand, a light<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or &s;hield of wicker.</NOTE> Targuate, &s;uch as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> be portrayed with in their pictures; but in the right hand a &s;word or Cymi|ter. And of this ranke con&s;i&s;t all the Rulers, except the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or ma&s;ters, and teachers.</NOTE> Preceptors of the boyes aboue&s;aid. Who by the time that they have &s;pent the&s;e twenty five yeeres, may well be &s;omewhat above fifty yeeres of age: and therefore then, they be accompted, of their ranke and number, who both indeed are, and al&s;o bee called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Elders.</NOTE> Seni|ours.</P>
<P>The&s;e Auncients goe now no more to warre out of their owne countrey, but re|maine &s;till at home, imploied in deciding and di&s;patching of all cau&s;es as well pub|like as priuate. The&s;e likewi&s;e determine iudicially matters of life and death. They have the election al&s;o of all Rulers and Magi&s;trates. And if any one of the younger &s;ort, or of the middle and &s;ettled age be &s;lacke in ob&s;erving the lawes, him whom&s;o|euer he be, the Tribunes [or Pre&s;idents of each Tribe and company] or any other per|&s;on el&s;e that will, doe pre&s;ent. And the&s;e Elders when they haue heard the cau&s;e, di&s;place the &s;aid party: who being thus removed out of his ranke, leadeth all the re&s;t of his life in di&s;grace and infamy. But to the end that the whole Common-wealth of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and the forme thereof may more evidently appeare, now will I returne and a&s;cend a little higher: For, by rea&s;on of that di&s;cour&s;e which hath already beene made, I &s;hall be able to declare the &s;ame very briefely.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are &s;aid to be in number about one hundred and twenty thou&s;and: and none of them all by law, vncapable of honourable dignities and Offices of State: Yea, and lawfull it is for all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to &s;end their children to the common &s;chooles of Iu&s;tice. Howbeit, they onely doe &s;end, who are able to keepe them otherwi&s;e in ea&s;e and doing nothing: but &s;uch as cannot &s;o doe, never &s;end them thither. And verily, the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or boyes.</NOTE> Children who haue had their In&s;titution by the publike Schoole-ma&s;ters, may lawfully among the young men pa&s;&s;e their youth forward; But &s;uch as haue not bin &s;o taught, may not once come among&s;t them. They al&s;o who haue conver&s;ed with other young men and performed their parts as the law requireth of them, are allowed to &s;tep higher vnto the fellow&s;hip of tho&s;e men that are come to full age; to be parta|kers al&s;o with them in Magi&s;tracies and dignities. But &s;uch as have not liued and con|tinued out their time, among the boyes or young per&s;ons above&s;aid, are never admit|ted into the &s;ociety of the middle aged men. Moreouer, as many as have pa&s;&s;ed their compleat time without blame and reproufe among tho&s;e of full and perfect yeeres, be promoted vnto the order and degree of the Auncients. And thus are they ordained Seniours, when they have gone through all good and hone&s;t functions. And truely this is that forme of policy and government, which as many as v&s;e be reputed &s;imply the be&s;t men and mo&s;t vertuous. And even at this day, there remaineth a te&s;timony, as well of their moderate diet, as al&s;o of working out their food. For even yet, a|mong the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> it is held a &s;hamefull thing, either to &s;pit, or &s;nit the no&s;e, or to &s;eeme full of vento&s;ities. Yea and a &s;hame it is for a man to be &s;eene openly to goe any whither abroad, either to make water, or to doe any &s;uch requi&s;ite bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of nature. And &s;urely, never were they able thus much to doe, vnle&s;&s;e they did, not onely, keepe a &s;pare diet, but al&s;o by trauell, &s;o &s;pend and con&s;ume their excrementitious moy|&s;ture, as that it might pa&s;&s;e and be conueyed &s;ome other way. Thus much I thought good to &s;peake of all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in generall. But now will I deliver the noble acts

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> went into <HI>Media</HI> with the Queene his mother: where he &s;hewed many tokens of his good nature and pregnant wit, vnto King <HI>A&s;tyages:</HI> &s;em|blably of his temperance and &s;obriety.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CYrus</HI> therefore was trayned vp in this di&s;cipline, vntill he came to be twelve yeeres old and &s;omewhat better: by which time it was well &s;eene, that he ex|celled all his &s;choole-fellowes, both in quicke apprehen&s;ion and aptne&s;&s;e to learne what was put vnto him: and al&s;o in performing of euery action hand&s;omely with a grace and manly courage. After which time [King <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> &s;ent for his daughter <HI>[Mandane]</HI> and her &s;onne: as having a great de&s;ire to &s;ee him, for the re|port that went, what a goodly and towardly Youth he was. So <HI>Mandane</HI> went to her father, taking with her <HI>Cyrus</HI> her &s;onne. Vnto whom, when &s;he was come, and that with great &s;peed, no &s;ooner knew <HI>Cyrus</HI> that <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> was his mothers father, but forthwith (as he was a childe by nature kind and louing to his parents) he &s;aluted and embraced him, as if he had beene one brought vp with him long before, or inwardly acquainted with him of old. And beholding him, how he was &s;et out with painting vnder his eyes, with a &s;et borrowed colour in his face, with a perrucke al&s;o or cap of counterfait haire on his head, after the gui&s;e of the <HI>Medes</HI> (for all the&s;e deuices are re|ceiued among them, like as be&s;ide the&s;e <HI>Median</HI> fa&s;hions, it is the manner with them to weare purple coates and Amices which they call <HI>Candyes,</HI> as al&s;o cheines and car|kanets about their necks, and bracelets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or on both armes.</NOTE> at both hands: whereas the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> &s;uch as keep at home in their owne countrey, even at this day v&s;e much cour&s;er rayment and more &s;lender diet, <HI>Cyrus</HI> I &s;ay, &s;eeing this gay attire and ornaments of his grandfather, and looking wi&s;tly vpon him, Mother, quoth he, what a faire grandfather haue I? And when his Mother asked him againe whether of the twaine he thought the good|lier man, his owne father or this his grandfather? he an&s;wered thus, Madame, of all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> my father is mo&s;t fightly: but of the <HI>Medes,</HI> as many of them as I haue &s;eene, either vpon the way, in the &s;treets, or at their dores, my grandfather here is the goodlie&s;t per&s;on by farre. <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> therfore imbracing the childe againe, did put vpon him a beautifull robe, and withall honoured and decked him with co&s;tly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or cheines.</NOTE> collars and bracelets. Al&s;o, if he rode forth any whither, he would haue <HI>Cyrus</HI> evermore with him, mounted on hor&s;e-backe, with a golden bridle, even as he was wont him&s;elfe to ride. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> (being a child given much to decent gallantne&s;&s;e, and no le&s;&s;e de|&s;irous of honour) as he tooke great delight in that rich robe, &s;o he joyed not a little, that he learned the feat of riding. For, in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> by rea&s;on that it is hard for want of forage to keepe hor&s;es, and to ride there, becau&s;e the country is full of mountaines, &s;eldome might a man &s;o much as &s;ee an hor&s;e. Now <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> being vpon a time at &s;upper with his daughter and [little<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or grand|child as &s;ome will haue it.</NOTE> nephew] <HI>Cyrus,</HI> minding al&s;o that the childe &s;hould &s;up with greate&s;t plea&s;ure and contentment, to the end that he might the le&s;&s;e long after home, did &s;et before him &s;undry platters full of the daintie&s;t cates and vi|ands of all &s;orts, and the &s;ame &s;erved vp with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Sauces that could be deui&s;ed. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as they &s;ay, &s;pake in this wi&s;e, Grand&s;ire, what trouble doe you put your &s;elfe vnto at &s;upper, if you mu&s;t reach with your hand to euery di&s;h
<PB N="8" REF="14">here, and ta&s;te of &s;o many and &s;undry meates? why? quoth <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> againe, Is not this, thinke&s;t thou, a finer &s;upper by many degrees than that in <HI>Per&s;ia?</HI> No verily Good Sir an&s;wered <HI>Cyrus,</HI> con&s;idering we goe a more plaine and direct way to &s;atisfie our &s;elues than yee do: For, bread and fle&s;h onely bring vs &s;traight thither; whereas yee, &s;hooting at the &s;ame marke that we doe, after much wandring vp and downe, and fetching many a compa&s;&s;e and winding cranke, hardly and with much adoe at length, arriue vnto that, whereto we attained long before.

Yea, but me thinkes, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that even your &s;elfe, grand&s;ire, doe loath the&s;e deinties.

Well, my &s;onne, quoth <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> if this be thy conceit; be merry yet and fall to thy fle&s;h-meats, that thou mai&s;t returne home a gallant Youth. Which he had no &s;ooner &s;aid, but he cau|&s;ed many kinds of fle&s;h, both wild and tame, to be &s;et before him. Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> beheld &s;uch &s;tore of fle&s;h, Tell me Grand&s;ire quoth he, doe you be&s;tow upon me all this veni&s;on and other fle&s;h-meats to doe what I li&s;t therewith? yea mary doe I my &s;onne quoth <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> I frankly give them all to thee.

But how is it quoth <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> that thou give&s;t nothing to <HI>Sacas</HI> my Cup-bearer, whom of all others I e&s;teeme mo&s;t? Now was this <HI>Sacas</HI> a goodly fellow of per&s;on; and be&s;ides, in that place of credit and honour, as to admit Suiters vnto the pre&s;ence of <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> and to put backe &s;uch as he thought came out of &s;ea&s;on and not meet to have acce&s;&s;e. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> (as a child) not &s;maying at all, nor aba&s;hed at the que&s;tion, readily came upon him againe with a reply, And why Grandfather, quoth he, &s;et you &s;uch &s;tore by this <HI>Sacas?</HI> Then <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> an&s;wered mer|rily in this manner, See&s;t thou not quoth he, how de&s;tly and featly he doth his office? for, the Cup-bearers of the&s;e Kings, be very neate and fine in powring in the wine with a &s;ingular grace: bearing the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or boll.</NOTE> Cup al&s;o with three fingers &s;o hand&s;omely, that as they deliuer it into the hands of him that &s;hall drinke thereof, hee may receive it with greate&s;t facility.

Whereupon, <HI>Astyages</HI> willed him to give the Cup unto <HI>Cyrus;</HI> which when he had received, he rin&s;ed it as featly as he had &s;eene <HI>Sacas</HI> doe it; and &s;o with a &s;etled countenance hee brought it to his Grandfather and gave it him &s;o curiou&s;ly with &s;uch a &s;eemely ge&s;ture, that he &s;et both his Mother and <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> a laughing full heartily. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe taking up a laughter for com|pany, ran unto his Grandfather and ki&s;&s;ed him, &s;aying withall, Thou art utterly un|done <HI>Sacas,</HI> for I am like to thru&s;t thee out of thy honorable place. For, as in other re|&s;pects I &s;hall powre out wine better than thou, &s;o when I do it, I will not drinke it off,
<PB N="9" REF="14">my &s;elfe. For, the&s;e Kings Cup-bearers when they pre&s;ent a cup of wine, powre &s;ome of it forth into a ta&s;ter which they hold in their left hand, and &s;o take the a&s;&s;ay and drink it off, to the end that if they had conveyed poy&s;on into the Cup, they might not e&s;cape them&s;elves without a mi&s;chiefe. Hereupon <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> min|ding to make &s;ome &s;port with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> And why, quoth he, unto him, do&s;t thou imitate <HI>Sacas</HI> in all points el&s;e, but dranke&s;t not the wine as he did? Becau&s;e, &s;aid he, I feared that poy&s;on was mixed therewith in the goblet. For, when upon your birth-day you fea&s;ted your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Favourites</NOTE> friends, I perceived evidently, that he pow|red forth unto you all, very poy&s;on. And how knewe&s;t thou that, quoth he, my Sonne? For-&s;ooth, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;aw you di&s;tempered both in body and minde. For, fir&s;t, looke what ye forbid us children to doe, that did yee your &s;elves: yee did &s;et up a cry, and howred all at once together: yee fell to &s;in|ging, and that very ridiculou&s;ly, and whom yee heard not to &s;ing at all, ye would not &s;ticke to &s;weare, that he &s;ung pa&s;&s;ing well. Moreouer, when every one of you bragged of his owne &s;trength and valour, no &s;ooner ro&s;e yee vp to daunce, but (&s;o farre were yee from keeping the mea&s;ures) that unneth ye were able to &s;tand vpright on your feet. So that yee all forgat your &s;elves, you, that you were a King, and the re&s;t that they were your &s;ubjects. And then learned I fir&s;t, that this which you then did, was that very<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> liberty of free &s;peech, which alloweth every man to &s;peake indifferently his mind. And, to &s;ay a truth, your tongues neuer lay &s;till. Why? quoth <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> then, Tell mee my &s;onne, when thy father drinketh wine, is hee not drunken otherwhiles? No truly, an&s;wered <HI>Cyrus.</HI> But how doth he order the matter, quoth <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> that he continueth &s;ober? Truly, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> he drinketh &s;o, as that hee allayeth his thir&s;t onely: and in &s;o doing, other harme hee feeleth none: For hee hath no <HI>Sacas,</HI> I trow, Grandfather, to fill him wine. Hereat inferred his mother and &s;aid, What is the rea&s;on my &s;onne, that thou art &s;o heauy a friend to <HI>Sacas</HI> and thus &s;et again&s;t him? To tell you troth, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> becau&s;e I hate him in my heart; for, many times when I am de&s;irous to runne unto my Grandfather, this fellow (mo&s;t lewd and wicked varlet as he is) puts mee backe. But I be&s;eech you good Grandfather, giue mee the command ouer him, but three daies. And after what &s;ort &s;aid <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> wilt thou exerci&s;e thy authoritie vpon him? Stand I will, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> in the very entry, where he is wont to &s;tand, and when he would come in to dinner, Backe Sirra will I &s;ay, There is no ingre&s;&s;e for you yet unto your dinner: My Grandfather is bu&s;ie in giving audience unto certaine per&s;ons. Againe, when he commeth to &s;upper, I will &s;ay, Hee is now bathing of him. And if I &s;ee, that very faine he would eat, I will tell him that my Grandfather is even then with the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Women.</NOTE> Ladies. Thus will I doe untill I have put him off, like as him&s;elfe u&s;eth to delude and delay mee, keeping mee backe from acce&s;&s;e to your pre&s;ence. Such prety &s;ports as the&s;e, mini&s;tred <HI>Cyrus</HI> at the table, all &s;upper while. But in the day time, if he perceiued that either his Grandfather, or Vn|kle by the Mothers &s;ide, had a minde to any thing, hard it was for any other to prevent him, in effecting the &s;ame: For, exceeding glad was <HI>Cyrus</HI> to gratifie them, in any &s;ervice to his power.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> How the Queene Mother <HI>Mandane</HI> returned into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Cyrus</HI> abode behind in <HI>Media:</HI> where he gave him&s;elfe much to Hor&s;e-man&s;hip and feates of Armes: and with his owne hand killed many wild bea&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>NOw when <HI>Mandane</HI> addre&s;&s;ed her &s;elfe to returne unto her husband, <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> be&s;ought her to leave <HI>Cyrus</HI> with him: But &s;hee made this an|&s;wer againe, That willing &s;hee was indeed to &s;atisfie her father in all things, howbeit &s;he thought it hard; to leave the childe behind her again&s;t his will. Then <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> directing his &s;peech to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> my &s;onne quoth he, if thou wilt tarry here with me: Fir&s;t and formo&s;t, for acce&s;&s;e to me, thou &s;halt not be beholden to <HI>Sacas,</HI> nor at his appointment: But when&s;oever thou art di&s;po&s;ed to enter into my chamber, it &s;hall be as thou wilt thy &s;elfe: and the oftner that thou &s;halt repaire unto me, the more thanke will I conn thee. Againe, mine owne hor&s;es &s;hall be at thy commaund, yea and others as many as it plea&s;eth thee to u&s;e: And when thou wilt depart, take with thee which of them thou li&s;t. Be&s;ides, at thy &s;uppers u&s;e thine owne diet, and take what cour&s;e thou wilt unto that which thou thinke&s;t to &s;tand with moderate &s;obriety. Moreover, I be&s;tow upon thee all wild bea&s;ts that now be in my Parke, and others will I get together for thee of all kinds: which, &s;o &s;oone as ever thou ha&s;t learned to ride an hor&s;e perfectly, thou &s;halt chace at thy plea&s;ure, and by &s;hooting and darting overthrow, like as tall and mighty men are wont to doe. Furthermore, I will appoint certaine young Gentlemen to bee thy play-feers: And in one word, what&s;oeuer thy mind &s;tands to, &s;ay but the word to me and thou &s;halt not faile but have it. After that <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> had thus &s;aid to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> his mother asked him, whether he would &s;tay or depart? who without any &s;tudy vpon the point, an|&s;wered readily, That tarry he would. And being demaunded againe of his mo|ther, wherefore? This (by report) was his an&s;wer: Becau&s;e, Mother, at home, as I am indeed, &s;o men repute me, of all my companions for &s;hooting and dar|ting the very be&s;t. But here, I know full well, that in riding I come &s;hort of all my fellowes: which thing, I would you knew, Mother, how it greeveth me not a little: Now, if you leave mee here behind you, that I may learne the feare of Hor&s;e-man&s;hip, when I am come among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you thinke, I &s;hall &s;oone &s;urpa&s;&s;e them (as good as they are) in foot-man-&s;hip: and if I returne hither unto the <HI>Medians,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour, being of many good hor&s;emen, the be&s;t my &s;elfe and mo&s;t excellent, to aide my Grandfather in his warres. Then replyed his mother, But how, my &s;onne, &s;halt thou learne Iu&s;tice here, &s;eeing thy Preceptors be there [in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>]? Why Mother quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I am therein per|fect enough already: And how knowe&s;t thou that? &s;aid <HI>Mandane:</HI> For&s;ooth, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> becau&s;e my Schoole-Ma&s;ter, taking me for one very well and throughly &s;eene in Iu&s;tice, appointed me to be a Iudge over others: And verily in deciding one time a certaine controver&s;ie, I was well beaten, becau&s;e I gaue not &s;entence aright: <HI>And &s;uch a ca&s;e it was as this. A great boy having a little coat, di&s;robed another boy, who being but &s;mall had a large coat: and when he had &s;o done, put upon that boy his owne coat, and with the others clad him&s;elfe.</HI> I therefore &s;itting as Iudge upon this matter betweene them, gave judgement in this wi&s;e,
<PB N="11" REF="15">That for both parties it was better, to have either of them, the garment that fit|ted them. But my Ma&s;ter did whip me for my labour: &s;aying withall, that if I were made a Iudge in que&s;tion of that which is meet and fit for any per&s;on, I ought to proceed in that &s;ort: But when I am to determine who&s;e coat it is? then I mu&s;t con&s;ider which is the rightfull po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? and whether it be rea&s;on for him to enjoy it, who having taken it away by violence, holdeth it &s;o; or ra|ther for him, who either cau&s;ed it to be made for him&s;elfe, or el&s;e bought it with his owne money? he added moreover and &s;aid, That a thing was then ju&s;t, when it was lawfull: and what&s;oever was unlawfull, the &s;ame al&s;o was to be reputed violent: and finally, hee concluded, that a Iudge ought alwaies to give defini|tive &s;entence according to the law. And even &s;o, Mother, I &s;ay to you, that in matters of Iu&s;tice I am perfect enough and &s;ufficiently practi&s;ed: but if in any point I be defective, my Grand&s;ire here &s;hall and will teach me and &s;upply my wants. But &s;onne, quoth &s;he, The &s;ame things are not all deemed ju&s;t by your Grandfather here, which among the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> be received &s;o. For here in <HI>Media,</HI> he hath made him&s;elfe the ab&s;olute Lord of all that the <HI>Medes</HI> have: whereas among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> to keep equality is held to be ju&s;t. Againe, your Father, what pre&s;cript rules are ordained in the State, receiveth the &s;ame, and is the fir&s;t him&s;elfe that ob&s;erveth them: So that, the rule and mea&s;ure which he goeth by, is not his owne lu&s;t and will, but the Law. Take heed therefore my child, that thou be not skourged to death at home, when thou art returned thither, having learned of him here, in &s;tead of Princely government, Lordly tyranny: the very nature and property whereof is this, To thinke it rea&s;on for to have and hold more than all others be&s;ides. Never feare that, good Mother, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> The King your father here is very wi&s;e and skilfull, that hee can teach one to have le&s;&s;e rather then covet more. For &s;ee you not, how he hath brought even all the <HI>Medes</HI> to this pa&s;&s;e, as to hold le&s;&s;e than him&s;elfe? Be &s;ure therefore Mother, that your Father will &s;o &s;choole me, that when he &s;endeth me away, I &s;hall be in&s;tructed as well as all the re&s;t, not to covet for to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e more than others. Many &s;uch &s;peeches and di&s;cour&s;es as the&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Well, at the la&s;t, <HI>Mandane</HI> his Mother tooke her leave and departed: but <HI>Cyrus</HI> remained behind, and had there his bringing up.</P>
<P>Quickly grew he into acquaintance with his companions, &s;o as hee became very inward with them: Soone al&s;o did he wind him&s;elfe into the love and fa|vour of their fathers, both by going unto them, and al&s;o by &s;hewing what affe|ction he bare to their children: in &s;o much, as if they them&s;elves had any &s;uit un|to the King, they would bid their children to reque&s;t <HI>Cyrus</HI> to take upon him for to di&s;patch their bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: And <HI>Cyrus</HI> for his part (&s;uch was his courte&s;y and de|&s;ire of honour) tooke no greater plea&s;ure in the world, when the&s;e children re|que&s;ted ought, than to &s;peed their &s;uits. Neither had <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> the power to deny any reque&s;t that <HI>Cyrus</HI> made, but was ready to &s;atisfie him therein. For, when it hapned that the King was &s;icke, he would never depart from him, nor give over weeping: that every man might well perceive, how exceedingly he feared, le&s;t his Grandfather &s;hould die. And if <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> called for any thing in the night whereof he &s;tood in need, <HI>Cyrus</HI> was the fir&s;t that heard him: &s;tart he would up, and of all others make greate&s;t ha&s;te to mini&s;ter vnto him &s;uch things as he thought might plea&s;e him: whereby he wonne <HI>Astyages</HI> his heart and was every way gracious with him. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> to &s;ay a truth, was peradven|ture
<PB N="12" REF="16">&s;omwhat talkative and too ful of words: partly by rea&s;on of his education, For that he was enforced by his &s;choolema&s;ter to render a rea&s;on of all his own doings, and to require as much of others, when he &s;at in Iudgement: and in part, becau&s;e (being as he was de&s;irous of knowledge) he would ever both him&s;elfe be inqui&s;itive asking many que&s;tions of them that were in place, how the world went with them? and al&s;o, what&s;oever others demaunded of him (&s;uch was the quickne&s;&s;e of his wit,) he had alwaies his an&s;wer ready for them: So that, con|&s;idering all the&s;e cau&s;es, he had gotten to him&s;elfe an habit of loquacity and much prattle. But like as in their bodies, who being very young, are &s;hot up, and growne to great &s;tature above their age, there appeareth neverthele&s;&s;e a cer|taine vigorous youthfulne&s;&s;e that bewraies their tender yeeres: even &s;o out of all the lavi&s;h language that <HI>Cyrus</HI> u&s;ed, there was &s;eene no audaciou&s;ne&s;&s;e, but &s;im|plicity and loving behaviour. So as any man would haue de&s;ired, &s;till to heare him &s;peake more and more, rather than to be with him when he held his peace. Howbeit, when in proce&s;&s;e of time, <HI>Cyrus</HI> was growen both in body and yeeres toward a young mans e&s;tate, he not onely u&s;ed fewer words and &s;horter &s;peech, but tooke him&s;elfe al&s;o to a more &s;till and lower voice. So ba&s;hfull likewi&s;e he was, that he would blu&s;h when&s;oever he met with any elderly per&s;ons. That overmuch forwardne&s;&s;e al&s;o of his, in fawning upon every man and prea&s;ing into all companies, like unto wanton whelps, he &s;hewed nothing &s;o much now, as be|fore: whereby he became more &s;tayed by farre, and neverthele&s;&s;e in all meetings right lovely and pa&s;&s;ing well accepted. For, truly, what games and exerci&s;es &s;oever companions are wont many times to practi&s;e one again&s;t another, looke in which hee knew him&s;elfe better than other young Gentlemen his fellowes, therein he never chalenged them: but wherein he wi&s;t full well that he was the weaker, he would be &s;ure to begin fir&s;t, and give out withall, that he would per|forme the &s;ame better than they. Yea he a&s;&s;ayed fir&s;t before all others to vault and mount on hor&s;ebacke, to &s;hoot al&s;o and dart from his hor&s;e. Went he any time away with the wor&s;e? very plea&s;ant he was and laughed at him&s;elfe mo&s;t of all: By rea&s;on therefore, that when hee had once the foyle, hee would not &s;hrinke and give over cleane, but &s;till a&s;&s;ay and practi&s;e eft&s;oones to doe better and better, tho&s;e feats wherein he was inferiour: in &s;hort time he became as good a rider as his fellowes: within a while al&s;o (&s;uch was his fervent affection to the thing) he outwent and excelled them all. To conclude, within a little &s;pace, what with chacing, &s;hooting and killing tho&s;e bea&s;ts which were in the parke, he made &s;uch havocke, that he de&s;troyed them all; in&s;omuch as <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> could not get together for him more game. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, perceiuing that his Grand&s;ire was not able, would he never &s;o faine, to furni&s;h him with bea&s;ts alive, many times &s;aid thus unto him, What need you Grandfather to trouble your &s;elfe &s;o much as you doe, in &s;eeking wild bea&s;ts? If you will &s;end me forth on hunting with mine Vnkle [<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">His mothers brother.</NOTE> <HI>Cyaxares</HI>] I will &s;uppo&s;e, that every bea&s;t which I &s;hall &s;ee, you keep up and nouri&s;h for me. And in very truth exceeding de&s;irous though he was to goe abroad into the forre&s;t, yet could he not now any more be &s;o bold and forward as before-time, when he was a child, but held off and tooke good lea&s;ure to come unto his Grandfather for to get leave: So that wherein heretofore he complained of <HI>Sacas</HI> for not &s;uffering him to go unto his Grandfa|ther, he was therein become a <HI>Sacas</HI> to controll him&s;elfe. For hee would not venture to pre&s;&s;e in, unle&s;&s;e he fore&s;aw that the time &s;erved thereto: yea he would
<PB N="13" REF="16">not &s;ticke to de&s;ire <HI>Sacas</HI> to doe him the favour, as alwayes to &s;ignifie unto him, when he might have the opportunity of acce&s;&s;e, and when not? And therefore this <HI>Sacas</HI> now loved him pa&s;&s;ing well, like as all others did. Now when <HI>A&s;tya|ges</HI> knew once that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;uch an ardent de&s;ire to hunting abroad in the Chace, he &s;ent him forth together with his &s;aid Vnkle: and appointed a guard of certaine auncient Gentlemen of the Court, who al&s;o were on hor&s;ebacke, with &s;peciall charge to keepe him out of daungerous places, and to &s;ave him from &s;a|vage bea&s;ts, if haply any of them &s;hould be put up. <HI>Cyrus</HI> therefore was very inqui&s;itive of the&s;e warders that attended upon him, what kind of bea&s;ts they were, which he might not approach nor meddle with, as al&s;o which hee might be bold to hunt? Who told him, that Beares, Lions, wild Boares and Libards had &s;laine already many a man adventuring to come over nigh unto them: But Harts and Hinds, Bucks and Does, wild Sheep and wild A&s;&s;es, &s;aid they, be no|thing daungerous to be dealt withall. They added moreover and &s;aid, that the difficulties of &s;ome places were to be taken heed of, no le&s;&s;e than the very bea&s;ts: For, many men, hor&s;e and all (&s;aid they) have heretofore fallen downe headlong from &s;teep rocks and &s;o peri&s;hed. <HI>Cyrus</HI> gave good care and willingly conceived all the&s;e adverti&s;ements: Howbeit, no &s;ooner had he e&s;pied an Hind on foot, but forgetting all that he had heard, hee made after her, looking to nothing in the world el&s;e, but whither &s;he made way and fled. In &s;o much as his hor&s;e under him, leaping forward, I wot not how, fell upon his knees, and went very neere to have ca&s;t him over his necke: neverthele&s;&s;e <HI>Cyrus</HI> made meanes, though it were with much adoe, to &s;it him &s;till, and &s;o the hor&s;e recovered. But &s;o &s;oone as he was come into the open field, he picked his dart and overthrew the Hinde, a goodly faire bea&s;t, I a&s;&s;ure you, and a large: whereat him&s;elfe verily rejoyced exceeding much: but his Governours and tho&s;e of the guard afore&s;aid, came ri|ding to him apace, all to rated and rebuked him, &s;hewing to what perill he had expo&s;ed him&s;elfe, and &s;aying withall that they would tell his Grandfather of him. <HI>Cyrus</HI> therefore who by this time was alighted from his hor&s;e, &s;tood &s;till, as one much grieved and troubled in his mind, to heare &s;uch words. But when he heard the cry, he leapt pre&s;ently on hor&s;ebacke againe, as one be&s;ide him&s;elfe and in a fanaticall fit: and &s;o &s;oone as ever he &s;aw a wild Bore affronting him, he ran again&s;t it, launced his jav'lin, and tooke his aime &s;o right, that he &s;truck him in the forehead, a&s;tonied the bea&s;t, overthrew him and gat the upper hand of him. Then, his Vnkle al&s;o &s;eeing his adventurous ra&s;hne&s;&s;e reproved him: who notwith&s;tanding his rebukes and checks, reque&s;ted him, that he might with his good leave, carry what&s;oever him&s;elfe had gotten, unto his Grandfather and pre|&s;ent him therewith. But his Vnkle made, as they &s;ay this an&s;wer, Your Grand|father, if he &s;hould know that you chaced the&s;e Bea&s;ts in proper per&s;on, would not only chide you, but reprove me al&s;o for &s;uffering you: let him skourge me too, and &s;pare not, quoth he againe, if it be his plea&s;ure, when I have once be|&s;towed them vpon him: And even you, Vnkle, may likewi&s;e cha&s;tice me, if you will, and as you li&s;t, &s;o you gratifie me fir&s;t in this my reque&s;t. Well, quoth <HI>Cyaxares</HI> then at length, doe as you will your &s;elfe, for now already you &s;eeme to be a King over us. So <HI>Cyrus</HI> pre&s;ented the bea&s;ts and gave them to his Grand|father, &s;aying withall, that he had hunted the &s;aid veni&s;on for his &s;ake. As for his darts hee &s;hewed them not openly unto him, howbeit all bloody as they were, he be&s;towed them in &s;uch a place where he thought his Grandfather &s;hould
<PB N="14" REF="17">&s;ee them. Then &s;aid <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> unto him, I accept my &s;onne gladly at your hands what&s;oever you give me: but I &s;tand in no &s;uch need of any of the&s;e things, that you &s;hould hazard your &s;elfe therefore. Why then Sir, quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> againe, if you need them not, I humbly be&s;eech your Grace, to be&s;tow them upon me, that I may deale them among my companions. Take them, my Sonne, quoth <HI>A&s;ty|ages,</HI> and give not onely the &s;ame, but what&s;oever el&s;e you will de&s;ire, to whom you plea&s;e. So <HI>Cyrus</HI> tooke them, and gave them among the boies &s;uch as him|&s;elfe, &s;aying thus withall, How trifled we my lads, when wee hunted the deere empaled within the parke? for mine owne part, I thinke it all one, as if a man &s;hould cour&s;e bea&s;ts in a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, pinfold.</NOTE> pri&s;on. And why? Fir&s;t they were enclo&s;ed within a &s;treight place: then, they &s;eemed but &s;mall, leane and mangy: &s;ome halt and lame, others maimed. But the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Or bea&s;ts.</NOTE> deere that be in the mountaines, Fore&s;ts, plains and medowes, how faire, how great, how fre&s;h and &s;lick &s;eeme they? The Harts and Hinds, like &s;o many winged foules, were &s;o fleet, that they mounted aloft toward the skie: and the wild Bores gave a&s;&s;ault, in manner, as one would &s;ay, of hardy and valiant men: &s;o large and broad withall, that a man could not po&s;&s;i|bly mi&s;&s;e them. Certes, in my conceit, the&s;e bea&s;ts here of the Fore&s;t lying &s;tarke dead, make a goodlier &s;hew, than tho&s;e immured within a pale or wall, for all they be alive. But how thinke you &s;irs quoth he, will your fathers give you leave to go on hunting? Yea, and that right &s;oone, &s;aid they, if King <HI>A&s;ty|ages</HI> would but commaund. Which of all you then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> will moove the matter to the King? Who, &s;aid they, is better able to per&s;wade and &s;peed than your &s;elfe? As for me quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> by <HI>Iuno</HI> I &s;weare, I wot not to what pa&s;&s;e I am brought. For neither can I &s;peake ought, nor able am I any more &s;o much as to looke my Grandfather in the face, as I was wont to doe. And if I grow on &s;till after this fa&s;hion, I feare me that I &s;hall proove altogether &s;ome blocki&s;h coward or &s;tarke foole. And yet when I was but a little child, mee thought I had tongue enough, and could &s;peake, none &s;o well. Why then &s;aid the boyes againe, by your &s;aying, it goes hard with us, in ca&s;e you can do nothing in our behalfe, if we &s;hould &s;tand in need, but that we mu&s;t &s;eeke unto &s;ome o|ther for to effect that, which lyeth in you to doe. <HI>Cyrus</HI> at the&s;e words being much agrieved and vexed at the heart, departed from them in &s;ilence: and ar|ming him&s;elfe with boldne&s;&s;e, hee went in to his Grandfather. Now when he had waited his time, and ca&s;t with him&s;elfe how he might without any trou|ble and di&s;plea&s;ure addre&s;&s;e his &s;peech unto him, for the obtaining of his and the boyes &s;uit, in this manner he began, Tell me, good Grand&s;ire quoth he, if any one of your hou&s;hold &s;ervants ran away, and you &s;hould catch him againe, in what &s;ort would you intreat him? How el&s;e, quoth he, but impri&s;on him, and force him to worke as a &s;lave in yrons? yea, but &s;ay, he returned of his owne ac|cord? after what manner would you deale with him then? what &s;hould I doe, but after I had skourged him, that he might doe no more &s;o, u&s;e him againe as I did before? Then were it high time, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> for you to be provided for to whip me, who have a purpo&s;e to run away, and to take with me my fellowes on hunting. Well, quoth <HI>A&s;tyages,</HI> it is hone&s;tly done of you yet, to give me war|ning; for now I commaund you not to &s;tirre one foot out of dores: A trim and goodly matter it were indeed, if I for a little piece or two of hunted fle&s;h, &s;hould bereave my daughter of her &s;onne. Vpon the&s;e words <HI>Cyrus</HI> obeyed indeed and tarried at home; howbeit with a &s;ad and heavie countenance he continued &s;ilent
<PB N="15" REF="17">and would not &s;peake a word. <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> then perceiving how hee &s;orrowed, as one much di&s;contented; yet minding to plea&s;e him againe, had him forth into the chace: And having a&s;&s;embled a great number both foot and hor&s;e, together with the boyes al&s;o, and cau&s;ed the wild bea&s;ts to bee driven together into the plains commodious for the hor&s;emen, he made of it a great day of hunting. Him|&s;elfe al&s;o in per&s;on all royally be&s;eene was pre&s;ent, and gave &s;treight commaun|dement, that no man &s;hould be &s;o hardy as to &s;hoot and &s;trike a bea&s;t before that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had his fill thereof. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> not able to endure that others &s;hould be thus forbidden, Grand&s;ire, quoth he, if you would have me to make a plea&s;ure of my hunting, &s;uffer all tho&s;e that are about me here, to cha&s;e, to &s;trive, and do their be&s;t. Then <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> gave them all leave: And him &s;elfe &s;tood &s;till and beheld how egrely they encountred the bea&s;ts, how they contended for the better, how they pur&s;ued them in chace and piked their darts at them: Great delight he took in <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who for very joy could not hold his tongue, but like a whelp of a good kind, &s;et up a cry, when he drew neere unto any bea&s;t, and therewith encouraged and called to every one by name. He rejoyced moreover to &s;ee how <HI>Cyrus</HI> laugh|ed at one, and to heare how he pray&s;ed another, without any &s;hew at all of repi|ning envie. But in the end <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> departed, with a great prey of many bea&s;ts: And from thence forward (&s;uch plea&s;ure he had in this hunting) hee would al|waies, when his lea&s;ure &s;erved goe forth with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> yea and for <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ake, take the youths afore&s;aid abroad, among many others be&s;ide. And verily after this manner &s;pent <HI>Cyrus</HI> the mo&s;t part of the time; wherein his carriage was &s;uch, that as he procured &s;ome contentment and good to all men, &s;o he wrought no di&s;|plea&s;ure nor harme to any.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> How <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> through the politike coun&s;ell of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> wonne a victory of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> who were come to invade his <HI>Territories.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOw when hee was about the age of fifteene or &s;ixteene yeers, it hapned that the Kings &s;onne of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> being upon the point of marriage, was very de&s;irous him&s;elfe in per&s;on, again&s;t that time to hunt. Hearing therefore that in the marches and confines betweene them and the <HI>Medes,</HI> there was great &s;tore of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> deere (for by rea&s;on of the warres, they were &s;pared and not of long time hunted) he had a mind now to hunt there. To the end therefore that he might follow his game in more &s;afety, he tooke with him, many of his light hor&s;emen, and targatiers, who &s;hould out of the rough thickets put out the bea&s;ts for him, and drive them into the tilled grounds and open plaines. And being come as farre as to his frontier Forts, and where he had a garri&s;on, there he &s;upped; that early the morrow morning he might hunt. Now by that time it was evening, there were come out of the city both hor&s;emen and footmen, to &s;ucceed in place of the former garri&s;on. So that now he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elfe to be furni&s;hed with a great army, as having two garri&s;ons in readine&s;&s;e, be&s;ides the foot and hor&s;e which him&s;elfe had brought with him. Vpon good delibe|ration therfore, he thought it be&s;t to make an incur&s;ion and rai&s;e booty out of the <HI>Medes</HI> ground; for that thereby, as the pa&s;time of hunting would &s;eeme more
<PB N="16" REF="18">brave and gallant, &s;o he thought hee &s;hould have greater &s;tore of bea&s;ts to &s;acri|fice. Betimes therfore in the morning, he did &s;et forward with his power in this order. His footmen he left thicke embattayled upon the borders: him&s;elfe with his Cavallery advanced toward the fortre&s;&s;es of the <HI>Medes,</HI> where he &s;tayed with the be&s;t men of armes and tho&s;e in number mo&s;t, whom he kept about him, that the garri&s;on &s;oldiours of the <HI>Medes</HI> might not make head upon his Avantcourri|ers as they &s;tragled and overran the confines: as for the light hor&s;men nimbly ap|pointed, he &s;ent certein forth out of every band to make rodes, &s;ome one way, &s;ome another, with commandement, to over&s;pread every place, and what&s;oe|ver came within their reach, to drive the &s;ame to his hand. Which &s;ervice they performed accordingly.</P>
<P>When adverti&s;ement was giuen to King <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> that enemies were already entred into his land, both him&s;elfe in per&s;on went forth with &s;uch as were about him to relieve the marches, and his &s;onne al&s;o, with &s;uch a troupe of hor&s;emen as were in readine&s;&s;e accompanied him. Not forgetting withall to &s;end out his commi&s;&s;ions to all others, for to come forward in aid. The <HI>Medes</HI> when they &s;aw a great power of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> arraunged in good order, together with their men of armes keeping their ground and not &s;tirring, made al&s;o a &s;tand them|&s;elves. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> for his part, &s;eeing others on all &s;ides, ready to &s;et forth in defence of the Frontiers, did the &s;ame likewi&s;e. Which was the fir&s;t time that ever he put harneis on his backe (a thing not permitted him before to do) &s;o de&s;i|rous was he to be armed: and truly a very fayre armour it was and well befitting him, which his Grandfather had cau&s;ed to be made compleat for his body. Thus armed at all peeces, and mounted upon a goodly cour&s;er, hee rode forward to the &s;ervice. <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> &s;eeing this, albeit he mervayled much at who&s;e commaund he came; yet required he him to abide with him and not to &s;tirre one foot. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, &s;o &s;oone as he di&s;covered a number of hor&s;emen afront, demaunded &s;ay|ing, Be tho&s;e yonder, our enemies Grandfather, who &s;it &s;till upon their hor&s;e|backs &s;o quietly? yea quoth he, enemies they are. And what are they a farre off that ride and drive before them, quoth <HI>Cyras</HI> be they likewi&s;e enemies? yes &s;aid <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> and they too. Now &s;urely Grand&s;ire, quoth he, they &s;eeme to be but cowards, and to ride upon very jades and titts, who thus harry and drive before them our goods. It were a good deed, yea and uery requi&s;ite, that &s;ome of us made a rode out after them. Yea, but &s;ee you not my Child (an&s;wered he) what a &s;trong troupe of great hor&s;e and men of armes, &s;tandeth on a plump in battell-ray? who if we &s;hould make after tho&s;e, would intercept us by the way and &s;top our pa&s;&s;age: be&s;ides, our forces are not yet come together. But if you will tarry here, replyed <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and receive &s;uch as are comming hither to aide; tho&s;e that &s;tand &s;till hereby, will be afraid and not once dare to quetch: tho&s;e o|ther al&s;o who are driving booties, will immediately forgoe their prey, upon the very &s;ight of &s;ome that charge upon them. Having thus &s;aid, he &s;eemed unto <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> for to &s;peake &s;omewhat to the purpo&s;e. Who wondring withall at his prudent foreca&s;t, and vigilant circum&s;pection, commaunded <HI>[Cyaxares]</HI> his &s;onne to take a Cornet of hor&s;emen, for to &s;et forward, and to charge tho&s;e that were a boot-haling. And I for my part quoth <HI>Astyages</HI> will make head at the&s;e here, if they once &s;eeme to &s;tirre and advance again&s;t you: &s;o that they &s;hall be forced to have a watchfull eye unto us. Thus <HI>Cyaxares</HI> taking with him the valiante&s;t men and be&s;t mounted, did put forwards. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;o &s;oone as he perceived
<PB N="17" REF="18">them to come on, &s;peedily breaketh out with them; and long it was not but him&s;elfe was the foremo&s;t of the troup, and led them all a great pace: <HI>Cyaxares</HI> followed hard, and the re&s;t were nothing behind. Whom, when they that drave the booty &s;aw to approach, incontinently they abandoned all and fled. But the company about <HI>Cyrus</HI> intercepted them: and whom&s;oeuer they could ouertake and reach, they wounded out of hand, and <HI>Cyrus</HI> was the foremo&s;t: but as ma|ny as ouerrode them and e&s;caped their hands, tho&s;e they pur&s;ued hotely, and ne|uer gave over untill they had taken &s;ome of them pri&s;oners. And like as a gene|rous Hound, untrained yet and without experience, runneth all on the head ra&s;h|ly upon the wild Bore: Even &s;o for all the world, rode <HI>Cyrus</HI> upon the &s;purre, looking at this onely, how he might &s;trike whom&s;oeuer he could overtake, and regarded nothing els. The enemies &s;eeing their fellowes thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and in jeo|pardy, came forward with their maine troupe, &s;uppo&s;ing that the chace would cea&s;&s;e, if they were &s;eene once to advance toward them. As for <HI>Cyrus,</HI> he &s;lac|ked never a whit the more, but for joy called upon his unkle, to hold on and maintaine the chace &s;till. And for that he had gotten the upper hand, he did put the enemies to an exceeding great rout. And verily, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> [the yonger] for his part, followed, haply for a reverent regard of his father: the re&s;t likewi&s;e came after, being then more willing by &s;uch an example to make pur&s;uit, who other|wi&s;e were not very courageous nor re&s;olute to encounter the enemy. <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> perceiving them incon&s;iderately to follow on &s;till, and the enemies many in number, and tho&s;e in good order of battaile redy to confront and receive them: being affrayd withall in the behalfe of his owne &s;onne and of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> le&s;t they being in di&s;aray &s;hould ra&s;hly ru&s;h upon the other &s;o well appointed, and &s;o en|danger them&s;elves, directly led again&s;t the enemies: who on the other &s;ide per|ceiuing the <HI>Medes</HI> making towards them, &s;tood &s;till, &s;ome with their darts redy to lance, others with bowes and arrowes bent to &s;hoot, and &s;o kept their ground: &s;uppo&s;ing that the other likewi&s;e would &s;tay and &s;tand, &s;o &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ne as they came within &s;hot, according as they were wont to doe. For, their manner was, thus neere and no more to approach one another, and &s;o many a time to skirmi&s;h on|ly with &s;hot at randam even untill night. But now &s;eeing their owne men to flye unto them amaine, and therewith the &s;ouldiers about <HI>Cyrus</HI> pur&s;uing them fierce|ly hard at heeles, and <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> likewi&s;e with his Cauallery, alredy within arrow &s;hot, they declined from them at one &s;ide and fled: The other, who al&s;o at once followed in chace, tooke many of them by force one with another: and whom|&s;oeuer they caught, downe they went, both hor&s;e and man, killing and &s;laying all that fell: and never gave over the execution untill they came as farre as to the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> Infantery: And there verily, for feare of &s;ome greater ambu&s;hment in covert, to intercept and cut them off, they &s;tayed them&s;elves. Then <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> retired with his forces, as right joyfull for the hor&s;emens victory: But of <HI>Cyrus</HI> he wi&s;t not what to make or &s;ay: For, well he knew, that he was the chiefe au|thour of this exploit: but he &s;aw withall, how in all the &s;ervice, for his audaci|ous adventure he fared like unto one furiou&s;ly tran&s;ported. For, even at that time I a&s;&s;ure you, when others were returning homeward, he onely did nothing els but ride up and downe all about, to view them that were ouerthrowne and &s;laine: in &s;o much as hardly could they (who had commi&s;&s;ion &s;o to doe) hale him away and bring him to <HI>A&s;tyages:</HI> and even tho&s;e who had the conducting of him, he cau&s;ed to goe a great way before, for that he perceiued his Grand|fathers

Whereupon <HI>Cyrus,</HI> by report, &s;aid, that depart he would, becau&s;e his father &s;hould not be offended, nor his countrey and the State complaine and finde fault with him. <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> therefore thought it requi&s;ite and nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him away: and having be&s;towed upon him &s;uch hor&s;es as it plea&s;ed him|&s;elfe to take, and furni&s;hed him be&s;ides with all things for that purpo&s;e, he ho|nourably di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him: which he did, both becau&s;e he loved him, as al&s;o for that he conceived withall a great hope of him, that he would prove a man ano|ther day, &s;ufficient both to plea&s;ure and helpe his friends, and al&s;o to di&s;plea&s;e and hurt his enemies.</P>
<P>Now was <HI>Cyrus</HI> at his departure accompanied on the way with all &s;orts and degrees, as well boyes and &s;uch as were of his owne yeeres, as men and Aunci|ents all on hor&s;ebacke: yea and <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> him&s;elfe rode onward with him: Nei|ther was there any one, as it is &s;ayd, but at his returne homeward wept amaine. <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o is reported to have &s;hed many a teare at his farewell: Moreouer, men &s;ay, that among his equalls in age and companions, he dealt many of tho&s;e gifts which <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> had be&s;towed upon him: In conclu&s;ion, the very <HI>Median</HI> Robe which he then ware, he did put off, and gave it unto one, declaring thereby that he loved him e&s;pecially above the re&s;t. Who when they had received the&s;e gifts at his hands, pre&s;ented them all, as they &s;ay, unto <HI>A&s;tyages:</HI> and <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> when he had them, &s;ent them backe unto <HI>Cyrus:</HI> but he returned them eft-&s;oones into <HI>Media,</HI> delivering this me&s;&s;age withall, If you would ever have mee, &ocirc; Grand|father, to repaire unto you againe without the blemi&s;h of &s;hame and di&s;grace, &s;uffer each one to have and hold that which I have given them: which words when <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> heard, he did according to the &s;aid me&s;&s;age. And, if I mu&s;t re|count &s;ome merry &s;peeches, and amorous words al&s;o that pa&s;&s;ed among, the voyce goeth, that at <HI>Cyrus</HI> departure, when they tooke their leave one of ano|ther, <HI>Cyrus</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his kinsmen with a ki&s;&s;e of his lips, after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> man|ner, for it is the fa&s;hion among the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> even at this day &s;o to doe. At which time there was one of the <HI>Medes</HI> a right good and an hone&s;t Gentleman, who ad|vi&s;ed well a long while, the exceeding beautie of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and wondered thereat: who when he &s;aw his other kin&s;men to ki&s;&s;e him, he him&s;elfe &s;tood &s;till and &s;tir|red not. No &s;ooner were the re&s;t gone, but he came unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> and &s;aid, What
<PB N="19" REF="19"><HI>Cyrus!</HI> Am I the only man whom you know not for your kin&s;man? Why, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> are you al&s;o of kinne to mee? Yea &s;urely that I am &s;aith the other. This was it quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that you eyed me &s;o: For mee thought I marked you oftentimes &s;o to doe. True &s;aid the other: and as de&s;irous as I was, all the while to come unto you, yet God &s;o mee helpe, for very ba&s;hfulne&s;&s;e I ever held off. But you &s;hould not have &s;o done, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> being a cou&s;in of mine: and with that he came unto him and ki&s;&s;ed him. The <HI>Mede</HI> when he had this ki&s;&s;e, asked him and &s;aid, Is this the manner indeed of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> for kin&s;men thus to ki&s;&s;e one another? Yea verily, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> both at meeting when they have not &s;eene one another a certaine time, and al&s;o at parting when they take their leave and goe forth any whither. Then it is time now &s;aith the <HI>Mede,</HI> that you give mee another ki&s;&s;e. Foreven now as you &s;ee, am I to depart. So <HI>Cyrus</HI> ha|ving ki&s;&s;ed him the &s;econd time, bade him farewell and went him&s;elfe away. They had not ridden farre a&s;under on their journey, but the <HI>Mede</HI> returned a|gaine with his hor&s;e under him all &s;weating and in a lather: whom when <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aw, what! &s;aith he, have you forgotten any thing that you would have &s;aid to mee? No verily an&s;wered the other, but after a time, I am come as you &s;ee unto you. True indeed, cou&s;in, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you are &s;o, and that after a very &s;hort time. What &s;hort time an&s;wered the <HI>Mede</HI> is that? wote you not, &ograve; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that if I doe but winke never &s;o little, I thinke the time very long, for that I &s;ee you not the while, being &s;o gallant a young Gentleman as you are? Hereat <HI>Cyrus</HI> began to laugh (and the fir&s;t time it was, after his former weeping) &s;aying withall unto him, Goe your wayes and be of good cheere: For &s;hortly the time will come, when you may behold mee if you will, with your eyes broad open and neuer winke for the matter.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> being in this manner returned into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> continued by report, one whole yeere more in the &s;choole of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Boyes.</NOTE> <HI>Children.</HI> And they verily at his fir&s;t com|ming would &s;coffe at him, as who having learned among the <HI>Medes</HI> to lead a de|licate life, was now come againe to them. But after that they &s;aw him to eate and drinke heartily and &s;avourly as they did: and found likewi&s;e by experience, that if there were any great cheere upon &s;ome high and fe&s;tivall day, he could finde in his heart to give away unto others &s;ome of his owne part, rather than de|&s;ire any of others: when they perceived be&s;ides, that in all other things <HI>Cyrus</HI> farre excelled them, then his companions began to have him againe in great e&s;teemation. When hee had pa&s;&s;ed through this fir&s;t di&s;cipline, and was now entred into the ranke of young-men: therein al&s;o hee &s;eemed to &s;urmount all the re&s;t, as well in &s;tudying and practi&s;ing all that was required, in endu|ring al&s;o and &s;uffering what&s;oever he was put unto, as be&s;ides in reveren|cing re&s;pectively his Seniors: yea and in obeying dutifully the Rulers and Ma|gi&s;trates.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> The beginning of the warres betweene the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> and the <HI>Medes.</HI> Of the forces that <HI>Cyrus</HI> levied in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to aide the King of <HI>Media</HI> his Vnkle.</HEAD>
<P>BVt in proce&s;&s;e of time <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> [the King dyed in <HI>Media:</HI> and <HI>Cyaxares A&s;tyages</HI> his &s;onne, and brother to <HI>Cyrus</HI> Mother, &s;ucceeded in the Empire of the <HI>Medes.</HI> Then the King of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> who had vanqui&s;hed all the <HI>Syrians,</HI> (and tho&s;e were no &s;mall nation,) &s;ubdued the King of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and brought him to his obedience, and who held already the <HI>Hyrcanians</HI> like|wi&s;e under his &s;ubjection, and now warred upon the <HI>Bactrians</HI> and be&s;ieged their cities, thought this with him&s;elfe, that if he could once conquer the <HI>Medians</HI> al|&s;o, or weaken their e&s;tate, he might &s;oone become the ab&s;olute Monarch of all the neighbour countries round about him. For, this Nation, of all the borde|rers was reputed mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant. Sending therefore unto his owne &s;ubjects, and to tho&s;e who were under his alleageance: likewi&s;e to <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> King of the <HI>Lydi|ans,</HI> and to the King of the <HI>Cappadocians:</HI> to the inhabitants of <HI>Phrygia,</HI> both the one and the other, to the <HI>Carians, Paphlagonians,</HI> to the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Cilicians,</HI> he layd open unto them many grievous imputations again&s;t the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> alleadging, how great and mighty the&s;e States were, how they combined and linked them&s;elves together by mutuall marriages: and in a word, were &s;o knit and united in perpetuall league and amity, that unle&s;&s;e &s;ome one aro&s;e by good foreca&s;t to prevent their growth and abate their force, great daunger there was, that they would invade one nation after another, and &s;o &s;ubdue them all. The&s;e Princes and States therefore, partly per&s;waded by the&s;e his &s;ugge&s;tions, and in part inveagled by his pre&s;ents and money, whereof he had exceeding &s;tore, con|de&s;cended and entred into a&s;&s;ociation with him. But <HI>Cyaxares A&s;tyages</HI> his &s;onne, perceiving what traines were laid and purveyance addre&s;&s;ed again&s;t him; imme|diately both made what preparation he could him&s;elfe: and al&s;o di&s;patched his Emba&s;&s;adours to the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> as well unto the States there, as al&s;o to <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> his brother in law, who had married his &s;i&s;ter and raigned King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Hee &s;ent al&s;o to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> reque&s;ting him that in ca&s;e the Councell and State of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;ent any power of men to aide, he would indeavour to be the Generall of tho&s;e forces. For, now by this time, had <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;pent his ten yeeres with the Youths, and was reckoned in the ranke of men full growne. <HI>Cyrus</HI> therefore having well approoved the motion, was by the Elders (Councellers of the State) elected Lord Generall in this expedition into <HI>Media.</HI> They gave him al&s;o commi&s;&s;ion to choo&s;e unto him 200. Gentlemen as Peeres called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That is, of e|quall dignity.</NOTE> Homotimi. Al&s;o every one of tho&s;e 200. they licenced to make election of foure others like unto them|&s;elves in degree: which number amounteth unto one thou&s;and. Semblably to every one of this thou&s;and they granted for to levy from out of the common people of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> 10. light targuatiers, ten &s;lingers, and tenne archers. By which meanes, over and above the thou&s;and Peeres or Gentlemen afore&s;aid, there were in all ten thou&s;and Archers, ten thou&s;and Targuatiers, and ten thou|&s;and Slingers. This &s;o great an army was committed to the conduct of <HI>Cyrus:</HI> who was no &s;ooner cho&s;en, but forthwith he began devoutly at the &s;ervice of
<PB N="21" REF="20">the gods: and being a&s;&s;ured by his &s;acrifices of their propitious favour, then and not before, he made choi&s;e of tho&s;e two hundred afore&s;aid: and when they al&s;o had taken every one foure more unto them: <HI>Cyrus</HI> a&s;&s;embled them all together, and made his fir&s;t &s;peech unto them in this manner.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> The oration of <HI>Cyrus</HI> to the Peeres and Chieftaines of his Army for to incite them to enterpri&s;e this warre with the better courage.</HEAD>
<P><Q>MY friends, cho&s;en you I have, not as one who had good proufe of you at this pre&s;ent and not before: but in that I have &s;eene, even from your Child-hood, with what alacrity you travaile in tho&s;e things which the Common-wealth reputeth vertuous: and utterly abandon &s;uch as it dee|meth vicious. But what motives induced me not unwillingly both to under|take this high place of government, as al&s;o to call you forth into the Action, I am now minded to declare unto you. Thus much I ob&s;erve, that our Aun|ce&s;tors have in nothing beene inferiour unto us, as who evermore practi&s;ed the deeds of vertue: But what benefit they have acquired being &s;o brave men as they were, either in publike to the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> Common-weale, or in private to their owne e&s;tates, I cannot yet perceive. For, &s;urely, in mine opinion, men give not their minds to exerci&s;e any vertue for this end, that when they are be|come good and hone&s;t, they &s;hould in nothing be preferred above the wicked. And even they that forbeare the fruition of plea&s;ures pre&s;ented unto them, doe it not becau&s;e they would never joy any more: but, for that by &s;uch con|tinent behaviour, they might in future time attaine to many and &s;undry de|lights. They that de&s;ire to excell in eloquence, aime not in all their &s;tudies and meditations to this end, that they &s;hould never give over the eloquent plea|ding of cau&s;es: but their hope is, that when they have by their fine tongues per&s;waded men to their minds, they may to them&s;elves purcha&s;e many great and goodly availes. Moreover, Martiall men that are emploid in feats of Armes, take not all this their paines, never to make an end of fighting: but even the&s;e men al&s;o, &s;et this downe to them&s;elves, that being once come to perfection in military prowe&s;&s;e, they &s;hall win both to them&s;elves and to their countrey much wealth, much happine&s;&s;e and great honours. Now, if any men after their great toyle in the&s;e affaires, before they reaped any fruit there|of, have carele&s;&s;ely &s;uffered them&s;elves to age, and thereby to grow unmeet for warre, in my conceit they fare much like, as if one de&s;irous to be a good and thrifty husbandman, &s;hould &s;ow well and plant his ground as well: but when he is to receive the encrea&s;e comming of his tillage and husbandry, &s;uf|fereth the corne not inned, to &s;hed, and fall againe upon the ground. Or, as if &s;ome Champion when hee hath &s;u&s;tained much travaile, &s;o as now he is thought a worthy victour, &s;hould never after enter into the li&s;ts and performe his devoyr. For, in my judgement, even &s;uch an one de&s;erveth worthily to be condemned for his folly. Let not us therefore my &s;ouldiers be faulty in this kind: but con&s;idering we are privy to our owne hearts, and a&s;&s;ured that even at fir&s;t from our tender yeers we have beene trained up in noble and worthy
<PB N="22" REF="21">Acts, &s;et me forward again&s;t tho&s;e enemies, whom I know mo&s;t certainly, by that which my &s;elfe have &s;eene in them already, to be unexpert in fight again&s;t us. Certes, for my part, I hold not the&s;e to be able &s;ouldiers, who how&s;oever they have the feat and knowledge, to &s;hoot well, to dart likewi&s;e and ride a&s;|well, yet cannot endure any labour, but quaile when they are put unto it. But the&s;e our enemies, for any matter of paines taking, are very raw and untrained novices. Neither are they to be accompted good &s;ouldiers, who when they &s;hould watch cannot away withall: and our enemies here are &s;uch, as for their &s;leepe cannot of all things want it: Nor yet may they goe for good warriors, who albeit in the points above&s;aid are &s;ufficient enough, yet be to &s;eeke how to carry them&s;elves toward their friends, and how to enemies. And evident it is that the&s;e here be altogether to learne tho&s;e di&s;ciplines which in warre be of greate&s;t con&s;equence. But as for you, able yee are to u&s;e the night in every point as well as others the day: yee repute labours to be the guides leading the way to plea&s;ant life. Hunger yee reckon in &s;tead of &s;auce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>: and to drinke water, yee can endure better than the very Lyons. To conclude, the fayre&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t precious trea&s;ure and be&s;t agreeable unto warriors that is, yee have laid up within your hearts: in that ye take more joy in being prai&s;ed, than in all things el&s;e in the world. And they that are lovers of prai&s;e and re|nowme, mu&s;t needs for the attaining thereto, willingly undergoe all travell and abide all daunger. Now, if I &s;hould pronounce thus much of you, thinking and knowing otherwi&s;e, I doe but deceive my &s;elfe: as upon whom the fault will redownd, inca&s;e no &s;uch thing be performed by you. But verily, &s;uch is your owne skill, your love al&s;o to me ward: &s;uch likewi&s;e is the blocki&s;h ig|norance of our enemies, that I tru&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the&s;e good hopes will not faile mee. Only let us march on in this our journey with bold and couragious hearts: con&s;idering, it is farre from us to be thought for to covet other mens goods unju&s;tly: for even now, as, our enemies are comming and begin fir&s;t to deale wrongfully with us: &s;o our friends call unto us for ayde. What then is there either more ju&s;t than to put by an injury, or more honou|rable, than to helpe our friends? Moreouer, in this regard I &s;uppo&s;e you re|po&s;e not the lea&s;t confidence, becau&s;e I have not enterpri&s;ed this expedition, with neglect of the Gods: For, being as yee are, privy unto many of my do|ings, and much conver&s;ant with mee, yee know very well that not only in weighty affaires, but al&s;o in &s;maller matters, I u&s;e alwayes to begin in the name of the Gods. In conclu&s;ion, quoth he, what &s;hould I &s;ay more? when you have cho&s;en and taken unto you elect men, and are otherwi&s;e in all points well and &s;ufficiently provided, &s;et forth toward the <HI>Medes.</HI> As for mee, repaire I will unto my Father, to the end that having with all &s;peed learned of him the &s;tate of our enemies, I may accommodate you what I can in this affaire, and &s;o with the power of God, make a right noble journey of it.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> The good in&s;tructions that <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> gave unto his &s;onne <HI>Cyrus</HI> as touching the enterpri&s;e against the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians:</HI> and how a good Captaine &s;hould carry him&s;elfe with his army in a &s;trange coun|try, and win the love of every man.</HEAD>
<P>THus therefore were they bu&s;ied and thus prepared they them&s;elves. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> after his returne home, and having made his prayers unto <HI>Ve&s;ta</HI> the Patrone&s;&s;e of his countrey, to <HI>Iupiter</HI> al&s;o the Protectour thereof, and to other gods, did put him&s;elfe in his war expedition: and his father brought him on his way.</P>
<P>When they were gone forth of the Palais, it thundered and lightned on the right and lucky &s;ide, as they &s;ay: whereupon without any other token or pre|&s;age taken by augury, they marched forth, as who would &s;ay; no man then could be ignorant of the &s;ignes given by the mo&s;t high and mighty God. Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was gone a little forward, his father began to di&s;cour&s;e unto him in this wi&s;e.</P>
<P>That the gods, my Sonne are propitious, and accompany thee with their gra|cious favour, evident it is as well by &s;acrifices as cele&s;tiall tokens: and thou thy &s;elfe doe&s;t know as much. For, taught thee I have the&s;e matters of purpo&s;e, partly that thou mighte&s;t know the will and coun&s;ell of the gods by no other interpreters, but under&s;tand the &s;ame by thy &s;elfe, &s;eeing the &s;ights and hea|ring the noi&s;es that are to bee &s;eene and heard: and not depend upon wi|zards, who might if they were di&s;po&s;ed deceive thee, by relating other things than were &s;ignified by the gods above: and partly becau&s;e, if at any time thou wert without a Sooth&s;ayer, thou &s;houlde&s;t not doubt what to re&s;olve upon, by tho&s;e divine tokens: but ob&s;erving by this skill of Divination what Gods will is, obey the &s;ame. Surely father, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> endeavour I will alwaies even to the uttermo&s;t of my power and according to your adverti&s;ement, that the gods being favourable unto us would ever be plea&s;ed to adui&s;e us for the be&s;t. For, I remember, that I heard you once &s;ay, It &s;tandeth with good congruity, that he &s;hould obtaine any thing at the gods hands as well as at mans, yea and more ea&s;ily, who doth not fawne upon them when he is in di&s;tre&s;&s;e: but at what time he is in greate&s;t pro&s;perity, even then thinkes upon the gods mo&s;t of all. You &s;aid moreover that the &s;ame con&s;ideration of friends likewi&s;e mu&s;t be had. Certes, then my Sonne, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> being as thou art &s;o devoutly affected to the gods, thou comme&s;t unto them now at this time more willingly in that regard, to crave their helpe, yea and thou hope&s;t &s;o much the rather to obtaine what&s;oever thou neede&s;t and make&s;t petition for, becau&s;e thy con&s;cience beareth thee witne&s;&s;e that thou wert never &s;lacke in their &s;ervice. Doubtle&s;&s;e, father, quoth he, I am thus conceited of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> gods, as of my affectionate friends. What Sonne, &s;aid the Father, and doe&s;t thou remember tho&s;e points, which &s;ometime we re&s;olved upon? Namely, that &s;uch men are like to &s;peed better who have learned tho&s;e &s;ciences which are given unto us by the gods, than tho&s;e that be ignorant of the &s;ame? Againe, that by travell they &s;hall gaine more, than by &s;itting &s;till? As al&s;o that by carefull diligence they &s;hall live in more &s;afety,
<PB N="24" REF="22">than if they carry them&s;elves carele&s;ly and take no heed? And verily thus was then our opinion, that after this &s;ort wee &s;hould crave good things at Gods hands, to wit, in demeaning our &s;elves as we ought. Truly Father, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I remember very well that I heard you deliver the&s;e le&s;&s;ons: and I could not choo&s;e but of nece&s;&s;ity yeeld my con&s;ent to tho&s;e &s;peeches and bee per&s;waded thereby. Full well I wot al&s;o, what you added moreover and &s;aid, that in no wi&s;e lawfull it was for them to crave of the gods victory in Hor&s;e-fight, who have not learned to ride well: neither for tho&s;e who be unexpert in &s;hooting, to pray unto the gods that they may have the better hand of cunning Archers: ne yet for &s;uch pilots as know not how to guide the helme, to be&s;eech the gods they may &s;ave &s;hips by their &s;teering: no more than for them that never &s;owed their &s;eed to wi&s;h for a fayre crop of corne to come up; or for tho&s;e who looke not to them&s;elves battayle, de&s;ire the &s;afety of their lives. For, all &s;uch [pray|ers and wi&s;hes] verily, be again&s;t the ordinance and law of God. Semblably, you &s;aid, that who&s;oever asked at Gods hands ungodly things, by as good rea|&s;on de&s;erved to be &s;aid nay, as tho&s;e to take a repul&s;e who preferre unto men un|lawfull &s;uits. But have you Sonne, forgotten tho&s;e matters, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> whereof you and I &s;ometime devi&s;ed and talked together? namely, That it is a &s;ufficient Act for a man to performe, if he be able to procure thus much, as to be him&s;elfe a worthy man indeed and &s;o reputed; and al&s;o that both he and his fa|mily may be well furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries: And if this be &s;o difficult a mat|ter to effect, then to have the skill, for to rule other men, &s;o, as they may have foi&s;on of all things needfull and be them&s;elves likewi&s;e all, &s;uch as they ought to be, I &s;uppo&s;e is an admirable thing. Truly Father, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I remem|ber full well that this al&s;o was your &s;aying, and therefore unto me as well as un|to you it &s;eemed then an exceeding hard matter to Governe wel. And even now likewi&s;e am I of the &s;ame mind con&s;idering as I do with my &s;elfe what a piece of worke it is to commaund. But when I looke into other men, and ob&s;erve withall, both the quality of tho&s;e per&s;ons that are become Rulers, as al&s;o what manner of concurrents and adver&s;aries we &s;hall find, I thinke it a foule &s;hame to be affraid of any &s;uch, and not willingly to oppo&s;e our &s;elves again&s;t them: whom I for my part (to begin fir&s;t with the&s;e our friends here) perceive to bee of this opinion, that a Prince or Ruler ought to differ from his people, and to goe be|yond them, in more plentifull fare and &s;umptuous &s;uppers; in having at home better &s;tore of gold and trea&s;ure; in &s;leeping and lying longer abed, and in a word in living at greater ea&s;e, and taking le&s;&s;e paines than tho&s;e that are under him. Whereas I (quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI>) contrariwi&s;e am of this mind, that a Soveraigne ought to excell his &s;ubjects, not in idlene&s;&s;e of life, but in prudent foreca&s;t and in for|wardne&s;&s;e to endure all trauaile. True it is Sonne (quoth he) but it falleth out otherwhiles in certaine ca&s;es, that we are to fight not again&s;t men, but even with the very things them&s;elves, which we cannot without great difficulty ouercome. As for example, you know well, quoth he, that all your rule and commaund will &s;oone come to naught, if haply your army have not at hand &s;ufficient pro|vi&s;ion of nece&s;&s;aries. Yes, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> but <HI>Cyaxares</HI> (Father) &s;ayth he is to make purveiance thereof to &s;erve all tho&s;e that goe from hence, how many &s;oever they be. And doe you indeed my Sonne, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> enter upon this jour|ney, tru&s;ting in the&s;e meanes of <HI>Cyaxares?</HI> Yea that I doe an&s;wered <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Why! doe you certainly know, replyed he againe, what &s;tore of trea&s;ure he hath?
<PB N="25" REF="22">Not I, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you. And give you credit neverthele&s;&s;e to the&s;e uncertainties? Or wote you not thus much, that you &s;hall have need of many things, and even anon be forced to &s;pend much otherwi&s;e? Yes, full well I know that, quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> How then, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es?</HI> Say that he either lacke money and bee not able to beare the charge: or for the nonce hold you up with un|truths; where are you then, and in what ca&s;e will your army be? Certes, plaine it is, verily that it cannot be well with it. If then, Father, quoth he, you &s;ee any way, whereby I may rai&s;e &s;ome ma&s;&s;e of money whiles we are yet among our friends, &s;hew unto me the &s;ame. Aske you of me &ocirc; Sonne, quoth he, whe|ther there may be meanes wrought by you to make money? Why? who &s;hould in all rea&s;on devi&s;e and ca&s;t about for to make provi&s;ion thereof, rather than you, who have &s;o pui&s;&s;ant an army to commaund? going as you doe from hence with &s;uch a power of footmen under your hand, as I know you would not exchange the &s;ame for another farre greater in number than it? and as for hor&s;emen, you &s;hall have a troupe to joyne with you from the <HI>Medes;</HI> which of all other in the&s;e dayes is &s;imply the be&s;t. What neighbour nation then, thinke you, will not bee glad both by way of gratification and al&s;o for feare of dam|mage and di&s;plea&s;ure, to relieve you? which you and <HI>Cyaxares</HI> ought joyntly to con&s;ider and thinke upon: to the end, that at no time you bee at a fault, for want of ought that mu&s;t be had: yea and if it were but for cu&s;tome &s;ake, you are of cour&s;e to lay for meanes to bring in revenewes &s;tore. But of all things re|member this e&s;pecially, that in no wi&s;e you deferre and put off your provi&s;ion, untill very need enforce you thereto: but whereas you have mo&s;t plenty, be you carefull &s;o much the more, to be furni&s;hed before you feele any want: For you &s;hall the &s;ooner &s;peed at their hands of whom you are to &s;eeke reliefe, if you &s;eeme not to bee de&s;titute and in need: be&s;ides, your &s;ouldiers &s;hall have no cau&s;e to find fault: and &s;o by this meanes, others al&s;o will the rather have you in reverence: your &s;ouldiers likewi&s;e &s;o long as they have all things nece&s;&s;ary, will be more ready to &s;erve, if you be di&s;po&s;ed by the help of your army, either to doe plea&s;ure or di&s;plea&s;ure unto any. And this moreover you are to know, that your &s;peech will carry greater credit, and be more effectuall to per&s;wade them, when as you &s;hall be mo&s;t able to &s;hew that you have power enough, as, to doe a good turne, &s;o al&s;o to worke a mi&s;chiefe. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Me thinks Fa|ther, quoth he, that you &s;peake all this very well unto me, as in other re&s;pects, &s;o in this al&s;o, that what&s;oever the &s;ouldiers &s;hall now receive, not one of them will take him&s;elfe beholden to mee as who know well upon what conditions <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;endeth for them to aide him: But looke what &s;hall come vnto them over and above that which is &s;et downe, the &s;ame verily will they both take as an honour due unto them&s;elves: and like it is by good rea&s;on al&s;o, that they will yeeld much thanks therefore, to the giver. Furthermore, he that hath the commaund of an army, by the which he may both doe his friends good, and &s;o receive for it the like benefit from them: as al&s;o endamage his enemies, by at|tempting to get &s;omething from them: and then afterwards bee negligent in purveiance of plenty and &s;tore. Thinke you this, quoth he, to be le&s;&s;e &s;hamefull in him, than if a man who hath land of his owne, and husbandmen be&s;ide to till the &s;ame, &s;hould yet for all that &s;uffer his ground to lie &s;till, and unprofitable? And therefore, this opinion I would have you Sir to conceive of mee, that I will never be carele&s;&s;e in devi&s;ing all meanes po&s;&s;ible of provi&s;ion for my &s;oul|diours
<PB N="26" REF="23">nece&s;&s;aries, neither in my friends countrey nor in mine enemies. But, beare you not in minde Sonne, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> what other matters we thought upon and concluded &s;ometimes, and tho&s;e in no wi&s;e to be neglected? Yes ve|rily, quoth he, I remember them well, what time I came unto you for &s;ilver, to pay unto one by way of reward, who &s;aid he had in&s;tructed me in the leading of an armie: For when you gave me the &s;aid money, you que&s;tioned withall in this manner with me. Tell mee, my Sonne, &s;aid you, whether this man to whom you carrie this reward, among his rules of a Generall, made any mention unto you of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hou&s;e-go|veroment.</NOTE> oeconomy? For, &s;ouldiers verily have no le&s;&s;e need of nece&s;&s;aries for their living in the Campe, than &s;ervants in an hou&s;e. And when I told you the truth and &s;aid, that hee &s;pake not one word at all of that point, you asked me againe, whether hee di&s;cour&s;ed unto me of health and bodily &s;trength, whereof a Grand-Commaunder &s;hould be no le&s;&s;e carefull than of the conduct of his ho&s;t? And upon my denyall thereof, you demaunded of me once more, if he had taught me any meanes whereby mine A&s;&s;ociates fighting under mee, might in every re&s;pect be mo&s;t expert in warlike feats? And when hereto al&s;o I an&s;wered nay: you enquired farther, whether I had learned of him how I might encourage and cheere up mine armie? &s;aying therwith, that in every deed, courageous alacritie, far excelled heartle&s;&s;e backwardne&s;&s;e. When I had denyed this too, you came yet &s;til upon me, and would needs know, what precept he had given of this point, namely the obedience of an armie, and how a man might be&s;t bring that to pa&s;&s;e? And when it appeared, that there had not been a word delivered as touching that, in the end you concluded with this que&s;tion, what one point he had taught me when he &s;aid, that he in&s;tructed me in the Art Im|peratory? Vnto which when I made an&s;wer, &s;aying, That he had trained me in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Tactiks.</NOTE> embattailing an armie, you &s;miled thereat, and di&s;cour&s;ed unto me in parti|cular, to wit, what good did the embattailing of an armie to the Art<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Impera|tory, without the purveiance of things nece&s;&s;ary to live by? al&s;o what availed it without pre&s;ervation of health? what, without the knowledge of arts devi|&s;ed for warre? what, without obedience of &s;ouldiers? Now when you had made it plaine to me, that the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tactick skill.</NOTE> &s;etting of a battayle in ray was but a &s;mall part of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of co~maun|ding an army.</NOTE> art Imperatorie, and therewith I asked of you, whether you could in|&s;truct me in any of tho&s;e points? you willed me to goe my waies and repaire unto military men, that were reputed expert Commaunders, and of them to en|quire how the&s;e matters each one might be&s;t be effected? Since which time I conver&s;ed with tho&s;e whom I heard to be mo&s;t skilfull in the&s;e points. And verily, as touching victuals for our campe, I am per&s;waded that &s;o much will &s;uffice for this pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, as <HI>Cyaxares</HI> will provide for us. As concerning our bodily health, becau&s;e I heard and &s;aw, how Cities &s;uch as regarded health, make choice of cunning Phy&s;icians, whom they maintaine: and Generals of the field al&s;o, for their &s;oldiers &s;ake, take Phy&s;icians forth with them in their traine, I likewi&s;e was no &s;ooner appointed to this charge, but pre&s;ently I had a care thereof. And I &s;uppo&s;e, quoth he, &ocirc; father, that I have about me very expert men in the Art of Phy&s;icke. Whereunto his Father replyed in this wi&s;e, But the&s;e Phy&s;icians, my Sonne, whom you &s;peake of, are much like unto certaine botchers, that mend torne garments; For, even &s;o, when &s;ome are fallen &s;icke, then and not before they cure and heale them. But your regard of health I would have to be much more honourable unto you: for, you are to endeavour
<PB N="27" REF="23">and provide in the beginning that your army fall not into &s;ickne&s;&s;e: And what cour&s;e &s;hall I take father, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to performe this? At the fir&s;t and prin|cipally you mu&s;t, quoth he, &s;ee to this, that the place be hol&s;ome, where you purpo&s;e to abide and lye encamped a long time together; wherein you cannot faile, if you take any heed. For, commonly men cea&s;e not in their ordinary talke to give out which be healthy coa&s;ts and which &s;ubject to maladies; and there be alwaies at hand certain apparent &s;ignes, to te&s;tifie and direct unto both, to wit the very bodies and colour of the inhabitants. Moreover, it will not be &s;ufficient to con&s;ider the regions onely, but remember you ought al&s;o, in what manner you endeavour to looke unto your &s;elfe, that your owne per&s;on may live in health. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> fir&s;t of all quoth he, my principall care I a&s;&s;ure you is, that I never &s;urfait, for that is a dolourous and yrk&s;ome thing. Secondly, with labour and travaile, I dige&s;t and worke out what&s;oever is gone into my belly: For, by this meanes I am per&s;waded, that I &s;tand to health the longer, and be&s;ides get the greater &s;trength. And even &s;o my Sonne, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> as carefull you ought to be of others. But may Souldiours, good Father, have lei&s;ure to exerci&s;e their bodies? Yes Iwis, quoth his father, they not onely may, but of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t &s;o doe. For an army, if it would doe as it &s;hould, and as belongeth thereto, ought never to be at re&s;t, but be doing &s;till, either working mi&s;chiefe to the enemies, or doing good to it &s;elfe. A griefe it is my Sonne, to nouri&s;h but one per&s;on idle, much more grievous to keep a hou&s;hold that is &s;loathfull: but mo&s;t importable of all, to maintaine a whole hoa&s;t in idlene&s;&s;e. Many things there bee in an army, (to begin at the lea&s;t, and &s;o to proceed forward) that eate and &s;pend: and looke what they winne, they wa&s;te exce&s;&s;ively. And therefore in no wi&s;e is it expedient that an army &s;hould bee idle. Your words, Father as I conceive them, imply thus much, that like as of a &s;loathfull husbandman there ari&s;eth no profit, even &s;o of an idle Generall can never come good. But I vndertake quoth he, that an indu&s;trious Captaine, unle&s;&s;e &s;ome God do cro&s;&s;e him, will both bring to pa&s;&s;e, that his &s;ouldiers may have plenty of victuals and nece&s;&s;aries, and al&s;o provide that their bodies be pa&s;&s;ing healthy, &s;trong and able. To the end therefore, quoth hee, that they may be well &s;eene and practi&s;ed in each feat of armes, I &s;uppo&s;e, Father, that if I publi&s;h to every one of them certaine games of pri&s;e, and propo&s;e rewards, I &s;hall cau&s;e them be&s;t to be exerci&s;ed in each thing: that when need &s;hall re|quire, I may finde them pre&s;t and ready for any &s;ervice. That is very well &s;aid of you Sonne, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es.</HI> And in &s;o doing, know this a&s;&s;uredly, that you &s;hall &s;ee your military bands alwaies &s;tudying to performe their parts, no le&s;&s;e than in daunces, to ob&s;erve mea&s;ures and keepe their order. Moreover, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> for to make &s;ouldiers forward and courageous, there is nothing in mine opinion more effectuall, than to have the ca&s;t to feed men with good hopes of great availes. But this, quoth he, my Sonne, is much like for all the world, as if a man in hunting would evermore holla to his hounds in &s;uch a note as he u&s;eth to &s;et up when he &s;eeth his game. For at the fir&s;t, full well I wote, he &s;hall have his hounds willing enough to heare and obey: but in ca&s;e he delude and deceive them often in this &s;ort, at the la&s;t they will not beleeve him at all, no, not when he &s;ees the game indeed. Semblably it is in this hope whereof you &s;peake. If a man propo&s;ing many times unto them the expectance of good things, deceive them, it will come to pa&s;&s;e in the end, that when &s;uch
<PB N="28" REF="24">an one, &s;heweth in truth a&s;&s;ured hope, he &s;hal not be able to per&s;wade them. And therefore, my Sonne, you ought to take heed, and &s;pare to &s;peake, that which you know not for certaine. Well may other men &s;ometime &s;o doe, and ca&s;t out words to that purpo&s;e: but it behooveth a Captaine to re&s;erve his owne encou|ragement to the greate&s;t daungers and extremities, that it may carry the mo&s;t credit. Now, beleeve me Father, me thinks you &s;peake this very well, and be|ing &s;o delivered, it plea&s;eth me better.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> How a Prince may gaine the obedience of his people, Vanqui&s;h his enemies, and get the attribute of wi&s;e and vertuous.</HEAD>
<P>BVr how to make my &s;ouldiours obedient unto me, I thinke not Father, that I am now to learne. For, you have taught me this your &s;elfe, even immediatly from mine infancie, when you enforced me to obey you. Afterwards you recommended mee in my childhood to Schoole-ma&s;ters, and they inured me likewi&s;e to the &s;ame. Al&s;o what time I was raunged among the young men, our Governour was very carefull and diligent in this behalfe. Yea, and mo&s;t of our lawes &s;eeme to pre&s;cribe the&s;e two points e&s;pecially, <HI>To Rule,</HI> and <HI>To be ruled.</HI> And therefore when I con&s;ider throughly the&s;e mat|ters in generall, mee thinkes I ob&s;erve thus much, that the thing which moveth men mo&s;t effectually to obedience, is, both to prai&s;e and honour him that o|beyeth, and al&s;o to di&s;grace and puni&s;h the di&s;obedient. Indeed my &s;onne, quoth he, this is the ready way to cau&s;e men to obey by con&s;treint, but to make men of their owne accord obedient (which is farre better) there is a more compendious cour&s;e to be taken. For, whom men thinke to be more wi&s;e in procuring their owne good than them&s;elves, him right gladly they will obey. And this you may know to be true as in many other in&s;tances, &s;o in &s;icke folke, how forward are they, to call for Phy&s;icians that &s;hould pre&s;cribe and direct what they ought to doe? Semblably at Sea, how cheerefully doe the pa&s;&s;en|gers obey the Pilots? Likewi&s;e, looke whom men &s;uppo&s;e to know the avenues and waies better than them&s;elves, how earne&s;tly &s;trive they to follow &s;uch guides, and will not by their good wills be left behin? But contrariwi&s;e, when they thinke that by obeying they &s;hall take &s;ome harme, they will nei|ther yeeld much for any puni&s;hment, nor yet be &s;tirred up with rewards; For, no man willingly taketh any gifts to his owne hurt. Then, Father, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> your words import thus much, that there is nothing more available to keepe &s;ubjects in obei&s;ance, than for a Ruler to be reputed wi&s;er than they. This is my meaning in deed &s;aid he. But how may a man Father, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;oone&s;t acquire &s;uch an opinion and e&s;teeme of him &s;elfe? There is not, my &s;onne, a neerer way, &s;aith <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> than to be prudent in very deed in tho&s;e things wherein a man would be thought wi&s;e. Doe but con&s;ider hereof in particu|lar, and you &s;hall find that I &s;ay true. For, if you would be taken for a good Husbandman, an expert hor&s;eman, a skilfull Phy&s;ician, a cunning Mu&s;ician, or any &s;uch, when you are in truth nothing le&s;&s;e, marke what a number of &s;hifts you mu&s;t devi&s;e to maintaine this outward &s;emblance? And &s;ay, that by your per&s;wa&s;io~, many men fal to prai&s;e you, to the end that therby you might rai&s;e a
<PB N="29" REF="24">glorious name of your &s;elfe: &s;o as you have now laid a good foundation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every of them with a &s;ingular conceit of you: Fir&s;t, you &s;hould but deceive them for the pre&s;ent; and &s;oone after when you come to the triall, be|wray what you are, and &s;o appeare in your owne colours, a vaine boa&s;ter. But how might a man Father, in very deed, attaine unto &s;uch wi&s;edome, as to fore|&s;ee what in future time will be expedient? Truly, even thus, my &s;onne, &s;aid <HI>Camby&s;es;</HI> If &s;o be you &s;tudy to get as much as may be had by learning, like as you are taught already the skill of mar&s;halling an armie. But, what things &s;oever men cannot learne by di&s;cipline, nor fore&s;ee by humane wi&s;edome, if you by divination, and oracles con&s;ult with the Gods thereabout, you &s;hall be wi&s;er than other men: e&s;pecially, if when you know what is be&s;t to be done, you be carefull withall to put the &s;ame in execution. For, to be indu&s;trious in procuring of things requi&s;ite, is the part of a wi&s;eman, rather than to be alto|gether negligent in that behalfe. Moreover to winne the love of &s;ubjects, a point, which I hold chiefe and principall, evident it is that the &s;ame way would be taken, as if a man de&s;ired to be loved of his friends. For, I &s;uppo&s;e that to effect this, he mu&s;t endevour to be &s;eene bountifull and beneficiall. A difficult matter it is my &s;onne, for a man to be able alwaies to plea&s;ure whom he would. But to &s;hew him&s;elfe joyfull and ready to congratulate their good fortune, and with them to grieve and take heavily any adver&s;e calamitie; as al&s;o to be pre&s;t and ready to relive them in di&s;tre&s;&s;e, to be affraied aforehand lea&s;t they doe a|mi&s;&s;e, to labour al&s;o to prevent and provide that they doe not &s;tumble and fall: in the&s;e ca&s;es, I &s;ay hee ought in &s;ome &s;ort to goe even with them and beare them companie.</P>
<P>To come now to the practi&s;e of armes; If &s;ervice fall out to be performed in Summer &s;ea&s;on, a Generall mu&s;t in all mens &s;ight endure the heat of the Sunne aboue the re&s;t: &s;emblably in Winter time abide mo&s;t cold: and where travaile is required, there is he to take the greate&s;t paines: For, all the&s;e things make much to the winning of his &s;ouldiers hearts. And &s;ay you &s;o, Father? quoth he, &s;hould a Captaine in deed be more painfull every way, than his men that &s;erve under him? Yea ywis, that is my &s;aying. Howbeit, my &s;onne, be of good cheere and be not di&s;mayed thereat. For, know you this, that the &s;ame labours be not in &s;emblable bodies of a chiefe Commaunder and a pri|vate &s;ouldiour, grievous alike: both becau&s;e in a Commaunder the re&s;pect of honour maketh the travaile &s;ome-what lighter; and al&s;o for that he knoweth what&s;oever he atchieveth &s;hall not be hidden but openly &s;eene. But, Father, when &s;ouldiers are now well provided of nece&s;&s;aries, when they be in good health and able to travaile: when they be trained in martiall fears, and have a kinde of ambitious humour, de&s;irous to appeare valiant: and withall take more plea&s;ure to obey than to be &s;tubborne and di&s;obedient, thinke you not, father, the man wi&s;e who then would make ha&s;t to encounter his enemies? Yes truly &s;aid he, if he might get the better of them. If not, I for my part verily, as I thought both my &s;elfe to be in better ca&s;e, and my followers al&s;o better ap|pointed, &s;o much the more would be wary and take better heed: like as all other things that we thinke mo&s;t precious and &s;et greate&s;t &s;tore by, we com|monly endevour to have in be&s;t &s;ecuritie. But, to get the vantage and ods of our enimies, by what meanes Father, may one be&s;t attaine? This is no meane point, I may tell you, my &s;onne, nor of &s;mall importance that you demaund of
<PB N="30" REF="25">mee. But know for certeine that who ever &s;hall effect this, had need be a wait|layer, a deepe di&s;&s;embler, a craftie and fraudulent deceiver, a very theefe and greedy robber, and in one word, every way able to overtop his enimies. Here|at <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;miling, &ocirc; good God, Father, what manner of man would you by the&s;e your words, have me to be? Even &s;uch a one, &s;onne, as may for all that, be right-ju&s;t, and mo&s;t ob&s;ervant of the lawes. Why then, quoth he, when we were children and younglings, taught yee us quite contrary to all this? Why! even &s;o doe wee now al&s;o, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> namely toward our friends and compatriots. And wote you not that yee learne many mi&s;cheivous devi&s;es, whereby yee may be able to annoy your enimies? No truly, Father, an&s;we|red <HI>Cyrus:</HI> Wherefore then, quoth he, learned yee to &s;hoot? For what pur|po&s;e were yee taught to dart? Why were yee trained up in taking wild Bores with net and toile, yea and in entrapping them in pitfals, or in catching Staggs with &s;nares, grinnes, and cords? Wherefore &s;tood ye not your ground, nor fought on even hand with Lions, Beares, and Libards, but evermore went about to encounter the&s;e wild bea&s;ts upon advantages? Or know yee not, that all the&s;e things be nought el&s;e, but mi&s;cheivous &s;lights, deceitfull practi&s;es, fraudu|lent wiles, and laying for all advantages? They are no other Father, quoth <HI>Cy|rus,</HI> howbeit, again&s;t &s;avage bea&s;ts. But, were I but &s;eene &s;o much as willing to beguile any man, I remember full well, that I met with many a &s;tripe for my labour. No force, &s;aid <HI>Camby&s;es.</HI> For wee did not, I take it, permit you, my &s;onne, either to &s;hoot your arrow, or ca&s;t your dart through a man: but we taught you to drive directly at a marke, and in no wi&s;e for the pre&s;ent to hurt and mi&s;cheive your friends: But if there hapned any warres, that ye might be able to level, yea and to hit even very men al&s;o. Likewi&s;e we taught you to practi&s;e deceit and to win advantage, not of men but of wild bea&s;ts: to the end that even herein yee &s;hould not hurt your friends. Howbeit in time of warre, if need &s;o require, yee might not be &s;hort in &s;uch feats. Then, Father, &s;aid <HI>Cy|rus,</HI> if it be expedient to learne both; namely, to know the way how to doe good and hurt al&s;o unto men, it were meet to teach men the one as well as the other. It is reported my &s;one, quoth <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> that there was &s;ometime in our aunce&s;tours daies a certein Schoolema&s;ter, that taught his children (right as you al&s;o would have it) Iu&s;tice [and Inju&s;tice] Not to lye, and withall, To lye: Not to deceive, and yet to deceive: as well, Not to accu&s;e wrongful|ly, as To accu&s;e unju&s;tly: both, Not to get advantage above others, and al&s;o To lay for private gaine and commoditie before others. Now, In the&s;e points, for&s;ooth, he did di&s;tingui&s;h thus, namely which they were to do unto friends; and which unto enimies. Nay, he went further than &s;o, and taught, That law|full it was even to beguile friends for profit, yea and to &s;teale from friends their goods for commoditie. He that taught the&s;e rules, could not chu&s;e but exer|ci&s;e his &s;cholars to practi&s;e the &s;ame one unto another when they were chil|dren: like as men &s;ay, the Greeks in the feat of wre&s;tling teach the art of de|ceit, yea and inure their children al&s;o to &s;upplant and beguile one another. Whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e, that &s;ome of them, growen to be towardly impes, both to beguile cleanly and al&s;o to get the vantage of others cunningly: and haply framed withall by nature not unapt for covetou&s;ne&s;&s;e and greedy getting of goods, &s;pared not their very friends but attempted to goe beyond them al|&s;o. Hereupon a law was made, which &s;tandeth in force with us at this day. That
<PB N="31" REF="25">our children &s;hould be taught &s;imply and after one way: even as we teach our hou&s;hold-&s;ervants, To &s;peake truth to our &s;elves, not to deceive, nor &s;teale and filch, ne yet to &s;eeke their owne commoditie: and if they tre&s;pa&s;&s;e herein, wee threaten to puni&s;h them. To the end that being nuzzled up and inured in this wi&s;e, they might prove the milder and more tractable patriots. Afterwards when they were growne to your age, then and not before it was thought, they might &s;afely teach, what things were lawfully to be done to enimies. For being thus brought up togither in a mutuall re&s;pective reverence one of another, yee are not like now &s;o farre to exorbitate and breake out of order, as to become fierce and fell among your fellow-citizens. And even &s;o, we doe not di&s;cour&s;e of venereous matters and fle&s;hly plea&s;ures unto tho&s;e that be very young: lea&s;t haply, young as they be, when audacious boldne&s;&s;e meeteth with heat of lu&s;t they might u&s;e the &s;ame immoderatly. Par-die quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> true it is, And therefore, good Father, forbeare not to teach mee what you can, as one &s;ome|what dull and comming late to learne, the&s;e &s;ubtill ca&s;ts of catching vantage how I may be able to make my part the better and out&s;trip mine enimies. Then &s;aid <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> Devi&s;e therefore to the uttermo&s;t of your power, when your owne men are, in good order arraunged, to &s;urpri&s;e your enimies when they be in di&s;array: with your owne &s;ouldiours armed and well appointed to a&s;&s;aile them unarmed: with your companies watching, to &s;et upon them fa&s;t a&s;leepe: when they are e&s;pyed by you, and your &s;elfe not di&s;covered by them: al&s;o whiles you are in a fen&s;ed place of &s;afety, to take them encumbred, within the difficultie and di&s;advantage of the ground. But how is it po&s;&s;ible Father, repli|ed <HI>Cyrus,</HI> for a man to watch his enimies &s;uch a turne, as to fall upon them in the&s;e and &s;uch like defaults? For that, my &s;onne, as well you as your enimies, are of nece&s;&s;itie to meet with many of the&s;e occurrents (For both of you ought to goe and &s;end out a foraging, yee cannot choo&s;e): yee mu&s;t needs of both &s;ides take your &s;leepe: Early in the morning, yee cannot otherwi&s;e doe but all-togither, make &s;tarts and &s;traggle a&s;ide to purvey nece&s;&s;aries: and &s;uch waies as yee light upon, be they better or wor&s;e yee are to u&s;e perforce. All the&s;e things ought you to thinke upon; and looke wherein yee finde your &s;elves weake&s;t, therein mo&s;t of all yee are to be wary and circum&s;pect: in what things you perceive your enimies ea&s;ie&s;t to be taken and vanqui&s;hed, therein e&s;pecially to &s;et upon them. What! quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> is it lawfull to lay for van|tage in the&s;e particulars onely, or in &s;ome others be&s;ide? Yes ywis, that it is, and in tho&s;e much more my &s;onne. For in the&s;e, all men for the mo&s;t part keepe &s;ure watch and ward, as knowing that ordinarily they have need thereof. But they that are skilfull to circumvent their enimies, can either put them fir&s;t in a good conceit of them&s;elves, and then &s;urprize them at unwares: or &s;uffer them to follow in cha&s;e, and &s;o cau&s;e them to breake their raies: or by &s;em|blance of flight, traine them into &s;treights and places di&s;advantageous, there to a&s;&s;aile them &s;odainly. Now, my &s;onne, it behooveth you, to practi&s;e not one|ly all the&s;e &s;tratagemes, which with earne&s;t de&s;ire you have already learned, but devi&s;e al&s;o and of your owne head other &s;leights again&s;t your enimies: even as Mu&s;icians, u&s;e not tho&s;e tunes and &s;ongs onely which they have learn'd, but &s;tudy al&s;o to make &amp; &s;et other. And verily in Mu&s;ick new dities and fre&s;h notes in their very prime are in mo&s;t reque&s;t: but much more in warre new policies are be&s;t &s;et by. For why? &s;uch late devi&s;ed inventions, are tho&s;e that &s;oone&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="26">can deceive the enimies? And if you my &s;onne, quoth he, would turne upon men nought el&s;e but tho&s;e &s;leights, which you have laid for very &s;mall wild bea&s;ts, thinke you not that you &s;hould make good progre&s;&s;e in winning the bet|ter hand of your enemies? For, to catch foule, you have in the mo&s;t bit|ter time of winter ri&s;en and gone forth by night: yea and before the poore birds were &s;tirring, &s;et &s;nares and grins for them &s;o cunningly as that the mooveable fal&s;e floore &s;eemed like unto that which mooved not. Be&s;ides certeine foules were &s;o taught by you, as that they &s;erved your owne turne, but in the meane time deluded other &s;illy birds of their owne fether: whiles your &s;elfe lay in convert and e&s;piall &s;o, as you &s;aw them, and they had no fight of you. More|over, your care and endevour was, to prevent the &s;aid foules and draw them unto you before they &s;hould flye away. As for the Hare becau&s;e &s;he goeth to releife and feedeth in the darke night, but by day &s;aveth her &s;elfe by her light foot, you kept Hounds which by &s;ent might finde her out: and for that when &s;hee is &s;tarted, &s;hee &s;wiftly runneth away, you had Greehounds be&s;ides trained of purpo&s;e to overtake her in pur&s;uit, by good footman&s;hip. And in ca&s;e the &s;aid Hares &s;hould out-&s;trip the&s;e Greehounds al&s;o, you learned out their paths and mu&s;ets: and to what harbours they chu&s;e to flie, therein you pitched haies and nets hardly to be &s;eene, to the end that the Hare in her mo&s;t eger flight 01 might fall into them, and therein entangle her &s;elfe. And that &s;hee might not e&s;cape thence, you placed men of purpo&s;e to watch and marke the manner of it, who being neere at hand &s;hould &s;treight-waies &s;eize upon her. And your &s;elfe verily from behind, by &s;etting up a lowd cry, that raught unto her, &s;o af|frighted the poore Hare, that caught &s;hee was at unwares: whiles tho&s;e who on the forepart lay in waite in&s;tructed by you to keepe &s;ilence were hidden and un|&s;eene. Therefore as I &s;aid before, if you would practi&s;e likewi&s;e &s;uch devi&s;es as the&s;e, again&s;t men, I know not for my part, how you &s;hould come &s;hort of any enemie in the world. Now, if it chaunce at any time, that you be enfor|ced, in plaine even ground and open feild to joyne battaile with en&s;ignes di&s;|played, when yee are on both &s;ides armed and well appointed, even then, my &s;onne, tho&s;e helpes and advantages provided long before do very much availe. And &s;uch, I &s;ay, be the&s;e: namely, if your &s;ouldiours bodies have beene well exerci&s;ed; if their hearts have had an edge &s;et upon them and thereby be well encouraged: and la&s;t of all, if they have diligently &s;tudied and practized mar|tiall feats aforehand. Moreover, this thing al&s;o you are to know; that &s;o ma|ny, as you &s;hall thinke it meet they &s;hould obey you, will all of them likewi&s;e deeme it as fit, that you provide for their good and &s;afetie every way. There|fore be you never carele&s;&s;e in this point, but fore&s;ee over-night what you would have your liege men to doe the morrow, and fore-ca&s;t by day, how night-&s;ervice may &s;peed be&s;t. Furthermore, in what &s;ort an armie is to be put in or|der again&s;t a battaile: after what manner it is to be led in march by night or day? how in &s;treights, how in broad plaines and open wayes? how over hilly places, how through champian fields and plaines? Al&s;o in what wi&s;e a campe is to be pitched? How watch and ward is to be &s;et, as well for night as day? How to advance again&s;t the enimies, how to come off, and retire? How to march before an enimie-citie? how to lead an armie to the a&s;&s;ault of a walled Fort, and how to withdraw the &s;ame from thence? In what manner to pa&s;&s;e through<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> hollow waies full of woods, or over rivers? What
<PB N="33" REF="26">order to take with hor&s;emen? what with darters and archers? Al&s;o, when you lead your armie di&s;plaied into wings, if then your enimies charge directly upon you, in what &s;ort are you to make head and with&s;tand them? Again, when you lead it in forme of a thicke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Phelony.</NOTE> &s;quadron, and they flanke you from &s;ome o|ther &s;ide, and not afront; in what manner you are to encounter them? Al&s;o, by which meanes you may be&s;t know your enimies behaviour and projects: and they lea&s;t perceive your de&s;&s;eine and purpo&s;e. But all the&s;e points, why &s;hould I now rehear&s;e unto you? For, what&s;oever my &s;elfe knoweth, you have often heard: and if others be&s;ides &s;eemed expert therein, you have not negle|cted conference with any one of them: and never were you dull witted and hard to learne. You ought therefore, as I thinke, according as occa&s;ions &s;hall be pre&s;ented, to put &s;uch in&s;tructions in ure, as you &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e will be at all times mo&s;t expedient for you. And learne withall, my &s;onne, of mee the&s;e di|rections of greate&s;t importance. Never adventure any thing either by your &s;elfe alone, or in your armie, without warrant of &s;acrifices and auguries by bird flight: con&s;idering thus much, that men take matters in hand no otherwi&s;e than by gue&s;&s;e, as not knowing for certeine from whence any good &s;hall re|dound unto them: how ever haply a man may by the events under&s;tand the &s;ame. For, many men and tho&s;e reputed mo&s;t wi&s;e, have per&s;waded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, or States.</NOTE> cities to make warre upon tho&s;e, at who&s;e hands they thus per&s;waded, have afterward beene overthrowne. Many a man be&s;ides, hath both enriched private per&s;ons, and al&s;o amplified publike States, from whom by their meanes thus enriched and advanced, they have &s;u&s;teined afterwards extreme lo&s;&s;e and mi&s;chiefe. Many al&s;o when they might have u&s;ed others as friends with reciprocall inter|change of doing and receiving plea&s;ures, chu&s;ing to make them their &s;laves rather than their friends, have felt the &s;mart thereof, and &s;uffred puni&s;hment even at their hands. Many againe, not content to live a plea&s;ant life with a competent and &s;ufficient portion, but coveting to be Lords of all, have lo&s;t thereby even all that they had, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before. And to conclude, many having gotten much gold and trea&s;ure which they &s;o greatly wi&s;hed for, have by the &s;ame peri&s;hed and come to ruine. Thus, mans wi&s;edome knoweth no more how to chu&s;e what is be&s;t; than if one &s;hould ca&s;t lots and draw what|&s;oever falleth unto him. Whereas, the immortall Gods know all as well pa&s;t as pre&s;ent, yea and the future events of euery King. And to as many as &s;eeking to them for direction they vouch&s;afe their gracious favour, therefore &s;ignifie, what enterpri&s;es they are to attempt, and what not. Now, if they be not willing thus to advi&s;e all men, no marvaile is it. For, they are not bound of nece&s;&s;itie to regard &s;uch as they will not.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> came into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> with his men, and procured them all to be armed by his Vnkle <HI>Cyax&aacute;res.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AS they di&s;cour&s;ed thus togither, come they were as farre as to the marches of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Where, after that an Aegle appea|red unto them on the right hand, and became their guide to lead them the way, they made their prayers unto the Gods and Demigods, Patrons of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Land, for to di&s;mi&s;&s;e them with propitious grace and fauour, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed over the bounds thereof. When they were once pa&s;t the&s;e Frontiers, they prayed againe to the <HI>Tutelan</HI> Gods of the <HI>Median</HI> Land, that they likewi&s;e would vouch&s;afe as graciou&s;ly and with &s;emblable favour to re|ceive them. This done, after they had in decent manner embracedech other, the father returned backe into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but <HI>Cyrus</HI> journeyed forward in <HI>Media</HI> to [his Vnkle] <HI>Cyax&aacute;res.</HI> When he was come thither unto him, at their fir&s;t meeting they &s;aluted one another, as it well be&s;eemed. Then <HI>Cyax&aacute;res</HI> enqui|red of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> how great an Army he had brought? Who an&s;wered, thirty thou|&s;and, even tho&s;e who were wont heretofore to come unto you and &s;erve as mercenaries: And certeine others be&s;ides of the Peeres ranke who never yet went forth to warre, are comming to them. And, How many be they? quoth <HI>Cyax&aacute;res:</HI> As for the number, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> it will not greatly plea&s;e you when you heare it: yet thus much I would you knew, that as few as the&s;e Peeres be whom we call<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The floure of the gentry cal|led <HI>Homotimi.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Homotimi,</HI> they &s;o farre excell, as that they be able ea&s;ily to rule all the other <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> be they never &s;o many. But what! Is there any need of the~? or did you feare in vaine? and happly the enimies come not. Yes verily, that they doe, quoth <HI>Cyax&aacute;res,</HI> and tho&s;e a great number. And how know you that? &s;aid <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Becau&s;e, quoth he, how ever there be many come from tho&s;e parts reporting diver&s;ly, yet they all agree in one point of &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;peake to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Then, I &s;ee quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> fight we mu&s;t again&s;t the&s;e men. No remedie &s;aid <HI>Cyax&aacute;res.</HI> Why then, replyed <HI>Cyrus,</HI> did not you tell me (if you have &s;o good intelligence) what power of theirs is a-foot, as al&s;o what our owne forces bee, that upon the certeine knowledge thereof wee may con&s;ult
<PB N="35" REF="27">togither, which way be&s;t to joyne battaile with them? Hearken then, quoth <HI>Cyax&aacute;res. Croe&s;us</HI> that rich King of <HI>Lydia</HI> bringeth, they &s;ay, ten thou&s;and Hor&s;emen: and of Targuetiers and Archers more than 40000. <HI>Art&aacute;mes</HI> the Prince of Great <HI>Phrygia,</HI> is &s;aid to come with a power of 8000 Hor&s;e, and of Pikemen and Targuetiers together, no fewer then 40000. <HI>Aribaeus</HI> King of the Cappadocians, leadeth (by report) 6000 Hor&s;emen, and his Archers with Tar|guetiers are not under 30000. <HI>Maragdus</HI> the Arabian, hath in his conduct 10000 men of Armes, one hundred Chariots; and of Slingers an exceeding great multitude. But as touching the Greekes that inhabit <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> it is not yet knowne, whether they follow or no? <HI>Gabaeus,</HI> as the &s;peech goeth, who hath from about the plaine of <HI>Cay&s;tros</HI> 6000 Hor&s;e, and 10000 Targuetiers, will augment his number, with tho&s;e of that <HI>Phrygia,</HI> which joyneth to <HI>Helle&s;pont.</HI> But the <HI>Carians</HI> verily, the <HI>Cilicians</HI> and <HI>Paphlagonians,</HI> for ought we heare, fol|low not, although they were reque&s;ted to come. Howbeit, the A&s;&s;yrian (Mo|narch) who hath under him <HI>Babylon</HI> and all <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> be&s;ide, will bring into the Field, as I &s;uppo&s;e, 20000 hor&s;e and no fewer: Chariots I am &s;ure not above 200: but of footmen, I gue&s;&s;e, an huge number: For &s;o is he wont to doe when&s;oever he invadeth the&s;e parts. By this computation then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you &s;ay that our enimies be in Hor&s;e 60000: of Targuetiers and Archers not &s;o few as 200000 &s;trong. Goe to now, to what number, &s;ay you, doe your owne forces amount? There be, quoth he, of <HI>Median</HI> Hor&s;emen, above 10000: of Targuetiers and Archers, there may be levied in our owne territory, about 60000. But of the Armenians and Borderers, there will be here 4000 Hor&s;e, and 20000 Foot. By your &s;aying then, inferred <HI>Cyrus:</HI> Our men of armes bee fewer than one third part of our enimies Cavallery, &amp; our footmen well neere halfe their Infantery. How then, &s;aid <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> doe you accoumpt the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to be but few, whom you bring as you &s;ay with you?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> As for fighting men, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> whether we haue need of any more or no? Wee &s;hall take into con&s;ideration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or &s;hortly, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> hereafter: but for the pre&s;ent, relate you unto me the manner of their &s;everall &s;ervices. Surely, quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> They u&s;e in manner all, the &s;ame kinde of fight. For, there be of them as well as of us, Archers and Darters. Since then, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> they be for weapons thus appointed, there mu&s;ts needs be skirmi&s;hing with volly of &s;hot from a farre? Of nece&s;&s;itie it will be &s;o, an&s;we|red <HI>Cyaxares.</HI> Then quoth he againe, in this kinde of &s;ervice it cannot be, but that the greater number &s;hall have the victory. For, &s;ooner will there be a few hurt and &s;laine by many, than many by a few. If the ca&s;e &s;o &s;tands, my good <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, what devi&s;e may a man finde better, than to &s;end unto the Per|&s;ians, both to declare unto them, that if the Medes &s;u&s;teine any di&s;a&s;tre, the lo&s;&s;e and calamitie will reach even unto them; and withall to require a greater power? But I would have you to under&s;tand thus much, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that if all the Per&s;ians &s;hould come into the field, wee were not able for number to &s;ur|mount our enimies. What other meanes then, doe you &s;ee better than this, quoth <HI>Cyaxares?</HI> Were I, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as you are, I would cau&s;e to be made for all the Per&s;ians that are comming, &s;uch armour in every point as tho&s;e Gentlemen of ours have, who are repairing hither and be called Homotimi: namely, a Cu|race over the bre&s;t, a light targuet for the left hand, and a &s;hort curtelax for the right. If you can provide us the&s;e armes; you &s;hall bring to pa&s;&s;e, that as it wil be more &s;afe for us to confront our enimies &amp; cope with them in clo&s;e fight:
<PB N="36" REF="28">&s;o it &s;hall be better for them to flie than to keepe their ground. And verily, we that are <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> be pre&s;t to deale with &s;uch as will &s;tand to it: but looke how many of them do flie, tho&s;e commit we to you and to your hor&s;men: &s;o that they &s;hall have no lei&s;ure, either to flie or once to turne backe. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had thus di&s;cour&s;ed upon the point, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> approved well his &s;peech: in&s;omuch, as he made no more words of &s;ending for a new levie, but pre&s;ently provided the ar|mour and weapons above&s;aid.

<P>MY friends, &s;eeing as I did, your &s;elves in armes &s;o well appointed and in hearts &s;o re&s;olute, as men ready to joyne in clo&s;e fight with the ene|mies: knowing withall, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> who follow you are not o|therwi&s;e armed than to skirmi&s;h a farre off; I was not a little affraid, lea&s;t yee being few in number, and abiding the &s;hocke of a battayle, de&s;titute of tho&s;e that were to &s;econd you, and falling upon your enemies &s;o many in number, &s;hould haply incurre &s;ome hard extremity. But now, con&s;idering yee are hi|ther come with &s;uch able and manly bodies, as cannot be found fault with: and that they againe &s;hall have the like armour unto yours: it remaineth onely that for your parts, yee whet and quicken their hearts. For, it is the office of a Cap|taine, not onely to &s;hew him&s;elfe hardy, but al&s;o to endeavour effectually, that his &s;ouldiers under him may prove right valiant. When he had thus &s;aid, they rejoyced all, verily for that they thought they &s;hould have many more to ac|companie them in fight; but one of them above the re&s;t delivered al&s;o the&s;e words.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be thought peradventure to &s;peake wonderous ab&s;urdly, if I &s;hould advi&s;e <HI>Cyrus</HI> to &s;ay ought in our behalfe, what time as they &s;hall receive their armour, who are to fight with vs again&s;t the enemies: For, this I know, that who&s;oever be mo&s;t able, either to doe a good turne, or to worke mi&s;chiefe, their words enter deepe&s;t into the hearts of the hearers. Such men al&s;o, if they be&s;tow any gifts, although they be le&s;&s;e than tho&s;e that come from equals, yet the receivers doe much more prize the &s;ame at their hands. Semblably the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> now, in ca&s;e <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;hould exhort them, would joy farre more, than if they were exhorted by us. And being admitted into the order of the Peeres, they will account the preferment more a&s;&s;ured, and the benefit better worth, if it proceed both from a Kings Sonne, and al&s;o from a Lord Generall, than if by our meanes they were advanced to the very &s;ame place of dignity. And yet ought not we to faile in performing our parts accordingly, but by all meanes wee can, encourage the&s;e men and give an edge to their &s;tomacks. For, the more valorous that the&s;e prove, the better it will be for our &s;elves. <HI>Cyrus</HI> there|fore having thus laid downe the armour afore&s;aid in the mids of the open place, and called together all the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;ouldiers, made unto them &s;uch an oration as this.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The exhortation of <HI>Cyrus</HI> unto the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;ouldiers, to put on the armour that King <HI>Cyaxares</HI> had prepared.</HEAD>
<P>MY friends, yee that are <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as yee were borne and bred up in the &s;ame region with us, and are in bodie be&s;ides framed nothing inferiour to us: &s;o, it is meet that your minds al&s;o be not wor&s;e then ours. And al|beit, &s;uch ye are indeed, yet in our native countrey yee were not in equall e&s;tate and condition with us: not for that yee were by us put by, but becau&s;e yee were enforced to provide nece&s;&s;aries. Now, both I, by the leave and power of God will take order that yee &s;hall have the &s;ame degree, and your &s;elves al&s;o, if yee be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, u&s;ing the &s;ame armes that we doe, how ever otherwi&s;e in meaner place than we are, may enter upon the &s;ame daungers with us, and up|on the atchievement of any noble and worthy exploit, receive the like guerdon to ours. Heretofore, yee were archers and darters as well as wee. In which manner of &s;ervice if yee carried not your &s;elves equall to us, it is no marvaile. For why? yee had not time to practi&s;e the&s;e feats, as wee had. But in this kind of armature here, we &s;hall have no vantage at all over you. For, every one of you &s;hall have a curace fitted for his bre&s;t, a light buckler in his left hand, as wee all were wont to carry, and in his right an arming &s;word, or battle axe wherewith we are to &s;mite our enemy that &s;tandeth oppo&s;ite unto us, and need not feare to mi&s;&s;e when&s;oever we offer to &s;trike. What is it then, (con&s;idering this manner of fight) wherein one of us &s;hould pa&s;&s;e another? unle&s;&s;e it bee in boldne&s;&s;e and courage, which yee ought to &s;hew as well as we. And as for vi|ctory, whereby all good things and excellent, are both gotten and kept, what rea&s;on is there that we &s;hould de&s;ire it more than yee? To &s;peake of Soveraign|ty, which giveth all away to the Conquerours, from them that be conquered, why &s;hould it concerne us more than you, to &s;eeke therefore? To conclude then, &s;aith hee, yee have heard all, and &s;ee the very armour. Take every man what he needeth and is fit for his body, and then give his name to the Captaine of &s;ome company for to be entolled in the &s;ame degree and ranke with us. But who&s;oever is content with the place of a mercenary &s;ouldier, let him remaine &s;till in &s;uch armes as are meet for &s;ervitours unto others.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> The ordinances that <HI>Cyrus</HI> made for the exerci&s;e of his &s;ouldiers, and to keep them in all obedience.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e were the words of <HI>Cyrus;</HI> which when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had heard, they made this account, that worthy they were from that time forward to live all their dayes in penury and want, if being thus called, to take paines alike, for to enjoy therefore like availes; they would not accept thereof. Whereupon they all entred their names, and being once regi&s;tred, tooke every man his armour. But all the while that the enemies were &s;aid to be comming neere at hand, and yet appeared not in &s;ight; <HI>Cyrus</HI> endeavoured both to exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="29">his &s;ouldiers bodies in &s;uch feats, as it might gather more &s;trength: to teach them al&s;o to &s;et their array, and embattaile, yea and to whet their &s;tomacks again&s;t warre-&s;ervice. But fir&s;t of all, having received mini&s;ters and offi|cers from <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> he commaunded them to furni&s;h every &s;ouldier &s;ufficiently with all things needfull: Which order being taken, he left them by this meanes nothing el&s;e to doe, but to exerci&s;e onely martiall deeds: &s;eeming, that he had learned and ob&s;erved thus much, that they became alwaies in every point mo&s;t excellent, who leaving to bu&s;ie their heads &amp; to deale in many things, gave their minds to one worke onely and no more. Nay, more than &s;o, even of military exerci&s;es, cutting off their training to the u&s;e of bowes, arrowes and darts, hee left them nought el&s;e to practi&s;e, but to fight with &s;word, buckler and bre&s;t-plate, whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e, that immediately he imprinted this opinion in them, that either they mu&s;t buckle with their enemies clo&s;e at hand-&s;trokes, or el&s;e confe&s;&s;e them&s;elves to bee warre-fellowes of no worth. But to acknow|ledge thus much was very hard and har&s;h to them: knowing as they did, that they were kept for no other purpo&s;e, but in defence of tho&s;e that gave them maintenance. Furthermore, weighing well with him&s;elfe, that men be much more willing to practi&s;e all tho&s;e feats, about which ari&s;eth an emulation and contentious de&s;ire of victory, he proclaimed games of price and triall of ma&s;te|ries among them, in all tho&s;e points that he deemed expedient for &s;ouldiers to put in ure.</P>
<P>Now, the particulars that he ordained and publi&s;hed were the&s;e: Imprimis, for a private &s;ouldier, that he beare him&s;elfe hardy, obey his Rulers and Cap|taines: be willing to labour; forward and pre&s;t to adventure; yet &s;o, as hee keep order in his ranke: expert in military affaires, elegant and neat in his ar|mour: and in all &s;uch things de&s;irous of prai&s;e and honour. For a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That hath the leading of 5. &s;ouldiers.</NOTE> Cinquenier, that both in his owne per&s;on he behave him&s;elfe as becommeth a valorous pri|vate &s;ouldier; and withall performe to the uttermo&s;t of his power, that the Quincury under his charge may be like unto him&s;elfe. For a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A leader of 10.</NOTE> Dizinier, that &s;emblably he tend his Decurie, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Caporall likewi&s;e his band. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Captain as I gue&s;&s;e over 25. or 50.</NOTE> Cen|tinier his hundred. For every Captaine be&s;ide, that he not onely demeane him|&s;elfe without touch and blame, but bee carefull al&s;o, that other peti-captaines under him keepe tho&s;e in good order whom they commaunded. Now, the re|wards or prizes which he propo&s;ed were the&s;e. For the Centiniers, That as many of them as brought their Centuries to be&s;t proufe, might be made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The leader of an hundred, or a Centution.</NOTE> Co|lonels. For the Caporals,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Leaders of a thou&s;and.</NOTE> that &s;uch of them as were thought to have trained their bands mo&s;t &s;ufficiently, might &s;ucceed in their places who had beene Cen|turions: In like maner that the be&s;t Decurions &s;hould be advanced to the rowme of Caporals: and the Quincurions likewi&s;e to the leading of Decuries. Finally, that private &s;ouldiers, &s;uch as excelled the re&s;t, &s;hould &s;tep into the Quincurions degree. And verily, all the&s;e Captaines gained this at fir&s;t, To be e&s;teemed of tho&s;e Companies whereof they had the rule: then, other honours con&s;equent|ly followed, as were be&s;eeming every one according to their calling. Further|more, he made &s;hew of greater hopes to &s;uch as were prai&s;e worthy, if haply in time to come, there &s;hould appeare any &s;hew of farther commodity. Hee proclaimed likewi&s;e rewards of victory, to whole Centuries, as al&s;o to whole Decuries and Quincuries: according, as they &s;hewed them&s;elves right<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> faith|full and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> obedient to their Captaines, yea and mo&s;t ready to execute the &s;ervi|ces
<PB N="39" REF="29">appointed unto them. And &s;uch were their rewards, as be&s;t befitted a mul|titude. Thus much as touching the&s;e particulars, which him&s;elfe publi&s;hed, and wherein the Soldiours were exerci&s;ed. Moreover, he provided for them Pavilions, for number as many as there were Centurions, and for their capacity &s;ufficient every one to receive a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A hundred.</NOTE> Company: and each Company contained one hundred Soldiers. And thus pitched they their tents by the hundreds. Of en|camping thus and lodging together, he &s;uppo&s;ed this commodity would ari&s;e unto them, again&s;t any future battaile, in that they &s;aw them&s;elves one with another kept and maintained alike: In which regard, none could have preten&s;e of Cowardi&s;e, for to &s;hrinke or beare him&s;elfe wor&s;e in fighting with his ene|my, as having &s;maller availes one than another. This conver&s;ing al&s;o under one roufe, he thought would make much for their mutuall acquaintance. For, in knowing each other, he was per&s;waded they would bee all more aba&s;hed to doe ami&s;&s;e: Whereas, tho&s;e who are unknowne, like unto &s;uch as live in dark|ne&s;&s;e, &s;eeme in &s;ome &s;ort more prone to commit wickedne&s;&s;e. Againe, it &s;ee|med unto him, that by rea&s;on of this &s;ociety in campe and pavilion, they &s;hould finde much good in the exact ordinance of their Companies and &s;etting them in array. For the Centurions had under them their hundreds lying and lodg|ing,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> in &s;o good di&s;po&s;e, as if every Century marched by it &s;elfe upon the way: Semblably the Caporals of their bands: The Decurions their Tenns and Quicurions their fives. This preci&s;e order of &s;everall bands and companies, he thought very profitable, both to prevent all trouble and confu&s;ion: and al&s;o in ca&s;e they were once &s;huffled and in de&s;arary, to rally and reduce them againe &s;ooner into order: like as &s;tones and pieces of timber, which are to bee joyned and &s;et together in building, how ever they chance to lye a&s;under and ca&s;t a&s;ide may yet be ea&s;ily fitted and couched one to another, if they have certaine marks, by which it may evidently appeare from what place every of them came? Fi|nally by &s;uch fellow&s;hip in living together at bed and boord, he thought they &s;hould finde this benefit, in that they would be more louth to for&s;ake one ano|ther: becau&s;e hee &s;aw, that even wild bea&s;ts feeding together hoan exceeding|ly after their fellowes, if happly any man plucke and &s;ever them a&s;under.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Cyrus</HI> had a &s;peciall eye to this al&s;o, that his Soldiours &s;hould ne|ver goe in, to dinner or &s;upper, unle&s;&s;e they had laboured fir&s;t, untill they &s;weat againe. For, he either led them forth on hunting, and &s;o cau&s;ed them to &s;weat, or el&s;e devi&s;ed for them &s;uch games and pa&s;times, as might drive them into a &s;weat. And if it happened, that him&s;elfe were to performe any exploit, hee would in per&s;on lead them, and &s;et into the action &s;o, as they &s;hould be &s;ure, not to returne without &s;weating. For, this he &s;uppo&s;ed to bee very good for them, cau&s;ing them to eate their meat with better &s;tomack and delight, to pre|&s;erve their health, and to enable them unto labour. Yea, and this fellow&s;hip in paines taking as he thought, would make them to be more milde and gentle one unto another. For, even hor&s;es accu&s;tomed to worke and labour togither abroad, are wont to &s;tand more gently and quietly in the &s;table. And certaine it is, that tho&s;e Soldiours will &s;ticke to it more couragiou&s;ly again&s;t their ene|mies, who are privy to them&s;elves that they have beene well exerci&s;ed. Fur|thermore, <HI>Cyrus</HI> for him&s;elfe reared a pavilion, &s;ufficient for the receit of tho&s;e, whom he bade at any time to &s;upper. And for the mo&s;t part, he invited to his table, &s;uch Centiniers as he thought meet. Sometimes, Caporals, otherwhiles
<PB N="40" REF="30">Diziniers and Cinquiniers: Now and then al&s;o, headmitted to his boord, cer|taine private &s;ouldiers, yea and whole companies or bands, of fives and tennes, of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, fifties.</NOTE> twenty fives and hundreds, at a time. This manner of inviting and doing them honour, he u&s;ed when&s;oever hee &s;aw &s;ome of them to have executed that exploit, which he would have had joyntly performed by all. As for the &s;er|vice of di&s;hes up to the boord, it was no other for <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe than for his gue&s;ts. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, Serge|ants and &s;uch.</NOTE> mini&s;ters in the campe, hee made equall in condition with the re&s;t, and partakers of all things. For that he judged the&s;e officers no le&s;&s;e wor|thy of honour and advancement than either Heraults or Emba&s;&s;adors. For, he &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch ought to be tru&s;ty; expert in military affaires, quicke witted and of good conceit, hardy be&s;ides and active, forward to action, and firme in re&s;olution: yea and more than &s;o, <HI>Cyrus</HI> judged that the&s;e mini&s;ters ought to be as much re&s;pected every way, and to enjoy as many preferments as tho&s;e, who were reputed the very be&s;t: and therefore &s;o to bee inured, as that they might refu&s;e no labour, but thinke all things meet for them to doe, which their Captaine commaunded.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> devi&s;ed and communed graciou&s;ly with his Chiefetaines: and of the plea&s;ant narrations that they related unto him for to doe him plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>OVer and be&s;ides, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when&s;oever hee with his invited gue&s;ts made merry togither in one Pavilion, endeavored alwaies to have &s;uch talke and &s;peeches interlaced among, as might cau&s;e mo&s;t mirth, and withall incite to vertue and prowe&s;&s;e. And one time above the re&s;t, he fell into &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e as this. What thinke yee, Sirs, &s;aith he, &s;eeme others be&s;ide our &s;elves? inferiour unto us any jote, in this regard that they had not had the &s;ame educa|tion and breeding with us! or will there be no difference at all betweene them and us, either in mutuall conver&s;ing together, or in manner of fight when we are to joyne battayle with our enemies? Then <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI> made an&s;wer and &s;aid, How they will demeane them&s;elves again&s;t the enemie, I wote not yet; but in their daily conver&s;ation, &s;o helpe me God, &s;ome of them &s;eeme peevi&s;h and tea&s;ty enough already. For, of late <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;ent unto every &s;everall Compa|ny, bea&s;ts &s;laine for &s;acrifice to make good cheere with, &s;o as there &s;hould fall to every one of our &s;hares three pieces of fle&s;h or more as they were &s;erved and carried round. And verily, the Cooke, when he went about with the fir&s;t &s;er|vice began at me: But as he came in, the &s;econd time to deale about, I willed him to begin at the hinmo&s;t and &s;o to hold on his cour&s;e the contrary way. Whereat one of tho&s;e &s;ouldiers which &s;at in the mids of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, round.</NOTE> Circle, cryed out and &s;aid, Pardie, here is no indifferent dealing, if no man will begin at us here in the mid&s;t. Which when I heard, I was not a little grieved, that they &s;hould thinke them&s;elves cut &s;hort and to have le&s;&s;e than the re&s;t; and therewith, I cal|led pre&s;ently for the &s;aid party to come and &s;it by me: who herein very orderly obeyed and came. Now when the meat that went about came unto us, where|of by that time, the &s;malle&s;t portion remained, by rea&s;on (as I take it) that wee were then the la&s;t to be &s;erved, this fellow then, would hold no longer nor
<PB N="41" REF="30">di&s;&s;imule his griefe, but &s;oftly to him&s;elfe brake out into the&s;e words, What ill lucke have I, who being now called hither, mu&s;t needs come, and fare wor&s;e then others for my labour? Take it not &s;o to the heart, quoth I, vnto him. For, the Cooke will pre&s;ently begin at vs: and then, &s;hall you bee fir&s;t &s;erued with the greate&s;t piece. With that comes the Cooke with his third and la&s;t cour&s;e, euen all that which remained behind. Then, that &s;ouldier tooke his part next af|ter me: But when a third al&s;o had receiued his &s;hare, and &s;eemed to the other for to haue gotten a bigger piece than he, he ca&s;teth from him that which he had taken already, as intending to lay hold on a greater piece. But the Cooke, &s;up|po&s;ing the man had enough already &amp; needed no more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> pittance, went his way from him, and &s;o made an end of his cour&s;e about, before the party could meet with another piece. Whereupon he was &s;o ill appaied for his hard hap, that when the meat was eaten vp which he had once receiued, the re&s;t, &s;auce and all wherein he &s;hould dip (in &s;uch a pelting chafe was he, and &s;o angry with his ill fortune) he quite ouerturned. A Caporall that &s;ate next vnto us, &s;eeing this, clapped both his hands together and laughed thereat full heartily. But I, quoth <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes,</HI> made as though I coughed: For, I a&s;&s;ure you, I could not containe my &s;elfe but laugh a good. And &s;uch an one, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> can I &s;hew unto you out of our owne fellowes. Hereat they laughed all, as they might well enough. Then another Centurion, This man quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> met belike with a fellow thus froward and di&s;contented. But I, quoth he, when you had taught us the maner of mar&s;halling our companies, and &s;o &s;ent us away commaunding every one to teach his owne company what we had learned of you, did my &s;elfe when I was gone from you, according as I &s;aw the re&s;t to doe, and in&s;tructed one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> band. Now when I had &s;et the Caporall, or leader of that band formo&s;t, and next unto him placed a lu&s;ty young fellow, and &s;o others in order, as I thought meet, I &s;tood then my &s;elfe before them all: and looking toward the &s;aid band, when I &s;aw my time, commaunded them all to march forward: Whereat, this &s;aid young&s;ter aduanced him&s;elfe before the leader and marched formo&s;t: which I &s;eeing, Whither now good fellow, quoth I, what meane&s;t thou to do? I march on Sir, quoth he, as you commaund. Then replied I, Why! I bad not thee alone, but all the re&s;t to come forward: which when he heard, turning backe to his fellowes, Come on Sirs, quoth he: Heare ye not how he commaun|deth us all to march? Then they all &s;tepped afore the Caporall, and came to|ward me: whereupon the &s;aid Caporall called them all backe againe to their places: with that they &s;tomached the matter and grumbled &s;aying: whether of the twaine mu&s;t we now obey? for the one biddeth vs march on, and the other forbiddeth vs. Well, I tooke all in good part, di&s;po&s;ing them eft&s;oones in or|der with this charge, that none of them behind &s;hould &s;et one foot forward un|till the former led the way, but all of them have a &s;peciall eye to this onely, even to follow the former. Now it hapned, that one intending to take a jour|ney into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> came and called upon mee for my letter which I had written home to my friends. Whereupon I willed a Caporall (for he knew where the &s;aid letter lay, to runne unto the tent and fetch the &s;ame: He ran accordingly; but the fore&s;aid young&s;ter followed the Caporall hard at heeles, armed as he was in his curace and with his curtelace. All the re&s;t of the whole band &s;eeing him to runne, ranne al&s;o amaine for company: and &s;o they all of them came and brought me my letter. Thus hath my band, &s;aith he, learned all that you have
<PB N="42" REF="31">enjoyned us. Hereat, all the re&s;t verily that were pre&s;ent laughed, as well they might, and namely at this warlike guard and convoy of the letter: But <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aid, <HI>O Iupiter,</HI> and all yee the Gods be&s;ides, what manner of A&s;&s;ociats have we to fight for us? &s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> tractable and ea&s;ie to bee wonne, that many of them will become good friends for a &s;mall piece of meate, and &s;ome againe &s;o ob|&s;equious, that before they know what they are commaunded, be ready to obey? Tru&s;t me truly, I wote not what kind of &s;ouldiours a man &s;hould wi&s;h rather to have than &s;uch. <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o laughed with them, and in this &s;ort prai&s;ed the &s;ol|diers. It fortuned moreover that in his Pavilion there was then, at this mee|ting, one of the Centurions named <HI>Aglaitadas,</HI> a man for his manners and be|haviour one of the&s;e au&s;tere and grimme Sirs, who began in this wi&s;e: Thinke you, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, that the&s;e men make a true report unto you? Why? &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> what &s;hould they meane to tell lies? what el&s;e, &s;aid the other, but be|cau&s;e they are di&s;po&s;ed to move laughter? in which regard they both come out with the&s;e tales, and al&s;o &s;hew them&s;elves bragging boa&s;ters. Oh good Sir quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Faire words I pray you. And terme not the&s;e men vaine vaun|ters. For the name of boa&s;ter or vaunter, as I take it, is aptly given unto them, that pretend either to be richer or more valiant than they are: &s;uch al&s;o, as pro|mi&s;e to doe, that which they cannot performe: yea and then e&s;pecially, when they are knowne evidently &s;o to doe for lucre. But they that devi&s;e meanes to make the company to laugh, neither for their owne gaine, nor to the damage of the hearers, ne yet for any other harme at all, why &s;hould not they more truely be called, merry conceited Plea&s;ants rather than Boa&s;ters? Thus much an&s;wered <HI>Cyrus</HI> by way of Apologie, in the behalfe of tho&s;e who had mooved laughter. Then the Caporall againe, who related the merry narration of his band. Now verily, <HI>Aglaitadas</HI> quoth he, If we had gone about to cau&s;e you to weepe, as &s;ome Poets and Oratours there be, who both in their Sonnets and al&s;o in their Orations, invent pitifull and lamentable arguments, thereby to provoke melancholicke per&s;ons to &s;hed teares, you would have greatly blamed us; when as you knowing as you do, that we are de&s;irous to make you &s;omwhat merry, and in no wi&s;e to hurt you, yet you requite us with great contumely and di&s;grace. I do &s;o indeed quoth <HI>Aglaitadas,</HI> and (by <HI>Iupiter</HI> I &s;weare) auow it well and iu&s;tly done. For, in my conceit, who&s;oeuer cau&s;eth his friends to laugh, doth not &s;o worthy an act by farre, as he that &s;etteth them a weeping. And euen your &s;elfe, if you weigh the thing aright, &s;hall find that I &s;ay trve. And why! by wee|ping, fathers bring their children to mode&s;ty and &s;obriety: Schoolema&s;ters likewi&s;e their &s;chollars to learne good arts and &s;ciences: yea, and the lawes, whiles they force citizens and &s;ubjects to &s;head teares, put them forwards to ob&s;erve and practi&s;e Iu&s;tice. But as for the&s;e Plea&s;ants that procure laughter, tell me if you can wherein they profit mens bodies or enhable their minds, the better, to menage either private government of hou&s;e, or publike admini&s;tration of Common-weale? Hereupon <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI> came upon him with &s;uch a &s;peech as this. Well, <HI>Aglaitadas,</HI> if you will follow my coun&s;ell, be bold to expend frankly upon your enemies this that you price &s;o high: and doe your be&s;t hard|ly to make them weepe: but upon us, your friends, be &s;o good as be&s;tow your laughing, being a matter of &s;o &s;mall co&s;t and valew. For, I know well, you cannot choo&s;e but haue plenty thereof layd vp in &s;tore: con&s;idering neither your &s;elfe for your owne v&s;e haue &s;pent, nor willingly affoord ought of it to
<PB N="43" REF="31" MS="y">your friends and gue&s;ts: and therefore can pretend no excu&s;e, but that you mu&s;t impart &s;ome laughter among us. Why? quoth <HI>Aglaitadas,</HI> and goe you about <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI> to fetch a laughter from mee? with that, the Caporall aboue &s;ayd, Nay in good faith; he were a very foole then: For I &s;uppo&s;e a man may &s;ooner &s;trike fire out of you, than get one laughter. Hereat all the re&s;t of the company, that knew the humor and quality of the man laughed hartily: and <HI>Aglaitadas</HI> him&s;elfe could not choo&s;e but &s;mile al&s;o a little. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then &s;eeing him di&s;po&s;ed &s;omewhat to mirth, You do not well, Caporall, quoth he, to offer this wrong; in that by per&s;wading the man to laugh, you &s;eeme to corrupt and marre this our mo&s;t &s;ober and grave gue&s;t: e&s;pecially being &s;o profe&s;&s;ed an enemie again&s;t laughter.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> The con&s;ultation of <HI>Cyrus</HI> with his Armie, whether hee &s;hould re|ward all his &s;ouldiers alike: or every one according to his de&s;ert?</HEAD>
<P>AFter all this, <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> entred into a di&s;cour&s;e in this manner. <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and yee all that are here pre&s;ent: I con&s;ider with my &s;elfe, There be come forth hither with us, &s;ome of more worth, and others of le&s;&s;e. How|beit, if there &s;hall befall unto us any good fortune, they will thinke them&s;elves all worthy of the &s;ame availes. But, I a&s;&s;ure you, I repute nothing in the world more unequall, than that the valiant man and the coward &s;hould be rewarded alike. To this point <HI>Cyrus</HI> inferred thus. It were be&s;t therefore my friends (be|fore God I &s;peake,) to put this matter in que&s;tion unto the Army: namely, whether they thinke it good, (if it plea&s;e God to &s;peed our labours,) to make all men of equall condition: or duly con&s;idering the &s;ervice of every one, to award them their rewards in proportion accordingly. And what need you quoth <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> to propound this matter for to bee debated? rather than to denounce that you will proceed &s;o? For have you not already proclaimed publike Games, and withall publi&s;hed prices? Yes, pardie &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> but the ca&s;e of tho&s;e and the&s;e is not alike. For, what&s;oever by their &s;ouldier-fare in this expedition, they &s;hall win; they will deeme the &s;ame, I thinke, to be com|mon unto me and them all. As for the &s;overaigne rule and commaund of the army, they &s;uppo&s;e it haply due &s;till unto me, as being laid upon me from the State at home. And therefore, in appoynting as I doe,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Provo&s;ts or Superiours.</NOTE> Captaines, and di&s;po&s;ing of their charge, they are per&s;waded, I trow, that I doe not therein wrongfully. And, thinke you quoth <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> that the whole multitude of them a&s;&s;embled together, will decree, That every man &s;hall not have equall &s;hare, but the be&s;t and worthie&s;t per&s;on ought to be preferred re&s;pectively both in honours and gifts? I verily, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> am of that mind: partly for that yee are ready to opine the &s;ame with me, and partly becau&s;e it is unbe&s;eeming to gain&s;ay this po&s;ition, That who&s;oever both travaileth mo&s;t and procureth greate&s;t good to the Co~mon-wealth, is worthy al&s;o of be&s;t advancement. Nay, the very ba&s;e&s;t cowards of all, will thinke it behoovefull I &s;uppo&s;e, that valiant men ought to bee preferred before others. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> verily was willing e|nough,
<PB N="44" REF="32">that this decree &s;hould pa&s;&s;e for tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Homotimi.</NOTE> Peeres &s;ake. For, he thought, that even they would bee more valourous, if they knew once, that being fir&s;t judged by their deeds, they &s;hould receive condigne rewards. He thought it therefore the be&s;t opportunity, at this very time, to have this matter decided by voices: when as the very Peeres them&s;elves feared this equall condition of the vulgar with them. It was thought good then, by all tho&s;e who were a&s;|&s;embled in the Pavilion of <HI>Cyrus</HI> to referre this que&s;tion in hand to a Scrutinie, and that, who ever would be reputed a man in deed, &s;hould accord thereto. A Centurion there was in place, who &s;miling hereat; One man quoth he of the common &s;ort I know, who will &s;oone agree that this even partage thus hand over head &s;hall not pa&s;&s;e. And who may hee be? I pray you, asked another. It is, &s;aith he, a tent-fellow of mine: who in all things by his good will would have more than others. What! &s;aith another, In labour and paines taking too? Nay, quoth he, Ho there. Here I am taken in a lye. For, in travailes and all &s;uch matters, he ever &s;uffreth very gently any one that will, to have more than him&s;elfe. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I ordaine &s;aith he, that &s;uch fellowes as he now &s;peaketh of, &s;hould be called and di&s;placed, if wee intend to have a valiant and obedient army. For, of this opinion am I, that the multitude, in generall, of &s;ouldiers &s;tand thus affected, even to follow which way &s;oever any man leadeth them. Now, &s;uch I &s;uppo&s;e as be hone&s;t and valourous, endeauour to be leaders unto good and hone&s;t actions: but lewd and wicked per&s;ons, unto lewd and naughty deeds. And truely, it falleth out oftentimes, that lewd folke induce more to follow them and take their part, than the better &s;ort. For, vice conver&s;ing a|mong plea&s;ures, which &s;oone offer and pre&s;ent them&s;elves, u&s;eth their helpe joyntly to per&s;wade many to a&s;&s;ent unto her: whereas vertue leading the way directly up to &s;teep a&s;cents, is not very powerfull and able &s;o quickly and out of hand to winne and draw men unto her: e&s;pecially if there be others againe who allure them to gentle, ea&s;ie and plea&s;ant de&s;cents. And therefore, if there be any, who onely in &s;luggardy loitering and refu&s;ing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> to take paines become naught, &s;uch I repute as drones to endamage their fellowes in matter of ex|pen&s;e, and nothing el&s;e: but &s;uch as in paines taking with others be &s;lacke, how|beit in &s;eeking their owne gaine, forward enough and &s;hamele&s;&s;e withall, they become ringleaders al&s;o unto lewdne&s;&s;e: For they are able many times to &s;hew and prove, that wickedne&s;&s;e hath &s;ped be&s;t, and gained mo&s;t. Wherefore &s;uch as the&s;e in any wi&s;e we ought to di&s;charge and remoove from among us. And verily yee are not &s;o much to con&s;ider, how yee may &s;upply and make up the&s;e your broken bands with your owne countrimen: but, like as in hor&s;es, yee lay for them that be be&s;t, and not bred at home: even &s;o in choice of men, of all others take them whom yee thinke likely and meet, both to adde mo&s;t &s;trength and bring al&s;o greate&s;t honour to your &s;elves. And that &s;uch a cour&s;e will &s;peed well I pre&s;ume al&s;o upon the te&s;timony of this one in&s;tance: For that neither can a chariot be &s;wift, in which the &s;teeds be &s;low: nor a Councell or judiciall Court be ju&s;t, wherein unrighteous men be joyned with others in Commi&s;&s;ion; ne yet a hou&s;e well governed that employeth lewd and naughty &s;ervants. Nay, le&s;&s;e detriment &s;hould an hou&s;e receive, wanting &s;ervants altogether, than being pe&s;tered with tho&s;e that be fal&s;e and wicked. Certes, my friends, I would have you to know thus much, that by weeding out lewd &s;ouldiers, not onely this good &s;hall en&s;ue, that &s;uch per&s;ons will be rid away and gone: but of tho&s;e al&s;o
<PB N="45" REF="32">who &s;hall remaine behind with us, as many as be already infected and growne full of wickedne&s;&s;e, &s;hall be purged of the &s;ame againe: Yea and the good, when they &s;hall &s;ee the wicked di&s;graced and put to &s;hame, will with farre grea|ter alacritie embrace vertue. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had thus &s;aid, all his friends approo|ved well of his words, and did accordingly. Then began <HI>Cyrus</HI> eft-&s;oones to je&s;t and inferre a plea&s;ant conceited &s;peech. For, perceiving one of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">&s;ome reade, <GAP DESC="foreign"> a Caporall or Leader of 12. as appeareth afterward.</NOTE> Cen|tiniers to bring with him as a gue&s;t to &s;upper, and to have &s;itting clo&s;e by his &s;ide, a certeine fellow exceeding hairy, and withall as foule and deformed: he called unto him the &s;aid Captaine and &s;pake thus unto him:</P>
<P>How now, <HI>Sambaulas,</HI> (for that was his name), leade you after the Greeke fa&s;hion about with you as your &s;haddow, this pretty youth that &s;itteth here next unto you, becau&s;e he is &s;o faire and well-favoured? Yea verily doe I, quoth <HI>Sambaulas:</HI> And, &s;o loue me God as I delight both to be in his company, and al&s;o to behold his countenance. When the other tent-fellowes heard this, they looked wi&s;tly upon the partie, and perceiving his face to be pa&s;&s;ing foule and ill-favoured, they all fell a laughing. And one among the re&s;t, Now for Gods &s;ake, quoth he, <HI>Sambaulas,</HI> for what good demerit is this man &s;o highly in your favour? I will tell you truly, quoth <HI>Sambaulas.</HI> How often &s;o ever I called him either by night or by day, he never pretended for his excu&s;e any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of his owne, nor u&s;ed to tell his &s;teps as he went, but al|waies ranne at my command.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> The Oration of <HI>Cyrus</HI> unto his whole Campe. The opinions of <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> and <HI>Pheraulas</HI> as touching that which <HI>Cyrus</HI> had propo&s;ed. And what was the conclu&s;ion and determination thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THE morrow after, when <HI>Cyrus</HI> had gathered all his &s;ouldiers togither, he made a &s;peech unto them in this manner: Friends we have a battaile toward: For, our enimies approach. And rewards belong only to victorie. If we be victours, certeine it is, that both the enimies will be ours, and likewi&s;e all the enimies goods: but if we be vanqui&s;hed (for this mu&s;t al|waies be our &s;aying) &s;emblably, all our goods in ca&s;e we be overcome, are pre&s;ent prizes and rewards evermore for the winners. Moreover, thus much yee ought to know, that if men taking part togither in warre, &s;hall every one &s;et downe this reckoning, that nothing will &s;ucceede well, vnle&s;&s;e for their
<PB N="46" REF="33">parts and places they play the valiant men, they will &s;oone atchieue many and tho&s;e right braue exploits. For, &s;uch as they, will not neglect through &s;louth any &s;eruice that is to be done. But when ech one thinketh, that &s;ome other man there will be to do the &s;eruice &amp; to fight, though him&s;elf &s;it &s;till &amp; take his ea&s;e: then make this full accompt and be &s;ure, that there is no misfortune and calami|ty, but all &s;uch per&s;ons mu&s;t abide it. And verily, this after a &s;ort is the ordinance of God: For, ouer tho&s;e who will not enioyne them&s;elves labour, to effect good things, he &s;etteth others to rule and command. Now therefore, let &s;ome one ari&s;e up here and &s;peake to the point, whether he thinketh, that it is like wee will giue our mindes to exerci&s;e vertue the rather, if he that is willing to travaile mo&s;t and to enter into greate&s;t daunger, &s;hall obtaine al&s;o the greate&s;t honour: or if he know, that it matters not at all if one bee a coward, &s;eeing that all of us &s;hall be rewarded alike? Then <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> one of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Knights, Homotimi.</NOTE> Peeres a|bove &s;aid aro&s;e. No big man was he of per&s;on to &s;ee to, nor &s;trong, but of &s;ingular wi&s;edome, who &s;pake in this wi&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you propound not this ca&s;e to be decided, be|cau&s;e you thinke it meet, that cowards &s;hould by right have equall part with valiant men, but to try, whether any one will be &s;eene to carry this minde, that although him&s;elfe execute no good and commendable Act, yet hee would be full partner, and reape like fruit of tho&s;e things, which others by their valour have atchieved? As for my &s;elfe, quoth he, &s;wift I am not of foot, nor yet a tall man of my hands. And full well I wote, that for any feats which I &s;hall with my body performe; I cannot be raunged in the fir&s;t, nor &s;econd, ne yet I &s;uppo&s;e in the thou&s;andth, no, nor peradventure in the ten thou&s;andth place. And yet thus much al&s;o, I know for certeine, that if hardy men &s;hall attempt any brave deeds, and doe their be&s;t, I &s;hall have &s;uch part of &s;ome good com|modities, as I am thought of right to de&s;erve: but if both cowards and &s;low|backs &s;hall doe ju&s;t nothing, and al&s;o the valorous and able men be put out of heart and di&s;couraged, I feare me, quoth he, I &s;hall have a part of any thing ra|ther than that which is good, yea and in greater mea&s;ure then I would.</P>
<P>When <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> had thus &s;aid, there &s;tood up after him <HI>Pheraulas</HI> a Per&s;ian Commoner, one in &s;ome &s;ort ever &s;ince they came from home, inward with <HI>Cyrus</HI> and well accepted of him. A man for his body not unper&s;onable, and in regard of his minde, &s;eeming no ignoble and ba&s;e pe&s;ant, who made this &s;peech.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, and yee Per&s;ians as many as are pre&s;ent, that we all endevour, and &s;trive to the triall of vertue. For, I perceive that general|ly wee acquaint our bodies to like diet: wee are admitted all, to &s;emblable &s;ocieties and meetings: and the very &s;ame acts of Prowe&s;&s;e are propounded to us all indifferently. For, to obey tho&s;e that be in authority, is a point in com|mon that concerneth all, and who&s;oever is known thus to doe without refu&s;all &amp; pretending excu&s;e for the matter, him I &s;ee mo&s;t honored at <HI>Cyrus</HI> his hands. Al&s;o, to be &s;tout and valiant again&s;t the enemy, is a thing not deemed decent for one, and undecent for another: but even the &s;ame hath been judged already to be mo&s;t &s;eemly and honourable for all. But now, &s;ay I, a fight battaile al&s;o is pre&s;ented unto us, unto which I &s;ee all men are fitted and skilfull by nature: like as other creatures are cunning every one in &s;ome fight or other, which they have learned of no other &s;choolema&s;ter but of nature. As for example, the Bull
<PB N="47" REF="33">[or Oxe] is naturally taught to pu&s;h with his horne, the Hor&s;e to &s;trike with his hou&s;e, the Dog to bite with his mouth, and the Bore to wound with his tusk. And all the&s;e bea&s;ts know to avoid tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t to be taken heed of. And yet for this, they never frequented any Schoole at all. My &s;elfe, when I was but a little one, knew even then, how to ca&s;t &s;ome thing in his way, who I thought would beat me. And if I had nothing el&s;e about mee, I would put forth both my hands and as much as po&s;&s;ibly I could impeach him that was &s;miting of mee. And this did I untaught. For, beaten otherwhiles I was, if in defence of my &s;elfe I oppo&s;ed ought betweene. Being but a very child, I would catch up a &s;word, where&s;oever I could &s;ee it, not taught of any other &s;o much as how to take and hold it, but onely by in&s;tinct of nature, as I &s;uppo&s;e. Nay, I would thus doe, when I was not taught, but forbidden to doe it: Like as other things there by, which notwith&s;tanding I was re&s;treined by my father and mother both, yet by nature I was enforced to practi&s;e: And, &s;o helpe me Iupiter, as I loved to be &s;triking with a &s;word, what ever I could reach covertly and not e&s;pyed. Neither was this unto me naturall onely, as to goe or to run, but be&s;ides the motion of nature that way, mee thought I found a plea&s;ure and &s;weetne&s;&s;e in &s;o doing. Seeing then, quoth he, this fight is left un|to us, wherein naturall courage is like to prevaile more than artificiall cunning; why &s;hould not we delight to enter into contention and aemulation with the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Gentle|men.</NOTE> Peeres: con&s;idering that the like rewards of fortitude be propo&s;ed unto us on both &s;ides? and yet we know, that we for our parts hazard not alike. For, the&s;e here adventure an honourable life, which is the onely life of all others mo&s;t plea&s;ant, but we a painfull and laborious life in deed, but a life without ho|nour, which I &s;uppo&s;e is mo&s;t odious and di&s;plea&s;ant. And now, my fellow foldiers, this mo&s;t of all inciteth me to entertein a contention and triall with them, For that <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;hall be our judge, who will not upon any envie deter|mine partially: but I dare upon mine oath &s;ay, That I am verily per&s;waded in my heart, that whom &s;oever <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;eeth to beare them&s;elves valiantly, tho&s;e he loveth no le&s;&s;e than his owne heart. And this I perceive in him, that upon them here, he be&s;toweth what he hath with more plea&s;ure, than keepeth it for him|&s;elfe: yet I am not ignorant: That the&s;e Peeres be high minded Gentlemen, and of hautie &s;tomacke, brought up and trained, as they are, to endure hunger, thir&s;t and cold: Full little knowing that wee have learned even the &s;ame of a better Schoolema&s;ter than they. For, there is no better Preceptour of the&s;e things than Nece&s;&s;itie, which hath taught us to be very perfect therein. As for the&s;e Gentlemen I &s;ay, enured they have beene to trauaile in bearing their ar|mours which all men have devi&s;ed to make &s;o, as they might be borne mo&s;t ea|&s;ily: but we were put to goe and runne al&s;o under great burdens: &s;o that now, the carriage of harnois, &s;eemeth unto me more like unto wings than burdens. And therefore, tak mee, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> for &s;uch an one as will doe my devoyr: and what&s;oever I am, better or wor&s;e, I &s;hall require to be honoured and advanced according to my worthine&s;&s;e and not otherwi&s;e. And yee al&s;o, my friends, of the Commons, I exhort you that yee will arme your &s;elves in this battaile to &s;trive for the better, with the&s;e Gentlemen &s;o well brought up. And now no doubt, quoth he, are the&s;e Gallants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Overmatchd.</NOTE> overtaken already in this triall with us the Commons. To this effect &s;pake <HI>Pheraulas.</HI> There were al&s;o, many others be&s;ide, who ro&s;e up and accorded to both their &s;peeches. Whereupon there
<PB N="48" REF="34">pa&s;&s;ed a Decree, That every man &s;hould be honoured and rewarded after his owne worth: and <HI>Cyrus</HI> to be Iudge thereof. And thus verily proceeded the&s;e matters.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> The feats of armes, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Captaines practi&s;ed in exerci&s;ing their Companies.</HEAD>
<P>MOreover, <HI>Cyrus</HI> invited al&s;o upon a time a whole Centurie togither with their Centinier to &s;upper, by occa&s;ion that he had &s;eene him to divide his Companie into two parts, and to &s;et them in battaile ray one &s;ide again&s;t the other ready to skirmi&s;h; armed, as they were on both &s;ides for defen&s;e, with bre&s;t-plates, and bearing in their left hands light<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or wicker targuets.</NOTE> bucklers. But for offen&s;e, he gave unto the one halfe in their right hands good round<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or wa&s;ters.</NOTE> ba&s;tons: &s;ignifying to the re&s;t, that they &s;hould take up clods and fling them at their oppo&s;ites. Now when they &s;tood thus arraunged and appointed, he gave them the &s;ignall to combat. Then the one part threw from them their clods at the other, and hit them, &s;ome on the bre&s;t-plates and bucklers, others upon the thighs and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or greaves.</NOTE> boots. But when tho&s;e were once come to clo&s;e fight, who had the wa&s;ters above&s;aid: they laid about them and ba&s;ted the other well: &s;ome on their thighs, others about their hands and armes: others al&s;o over their &s;hinnes and legges: yea and if any of them &s;touped for to take up clods, they would be &s;ure to lay upon their necks and backs. At length the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or ba&s;toniers.</NOTE> wa&s;ter-men put the others to flight, pur&s;ued them, and beat them throughly with much good laughter and pa&s;time. Others al&s;o for their parts againe, would in like manner take wa&s;ters in hand and &s;erve them &s;o who fought with flinging clods: <HI>Cyrus</HI> admiring as well the witty devi&s;e of the Leader, as the due obedience of the Soldiers: for that they were at once both exerci&s;ed and al&s;o emboldened: and &s;eeing withall, tho&s;e gaine the better who counterfaited the Per&s;ians armour and weapons, being much delighted with this &s;ight, bade them all to &s;upper: and e&s;pying in his pavilion, &s;ome of them with their &s;hinnes and legges, others with their armes and hands bound up, he asked them what they ayled? who an&s;wered that they had beene hurt with clods: then demaunded he of them a|gaine, whether they caught their hurt when they met clo&s;e togither, or when they were farre a&s;under? they made an&s;wer, when they were farre a&s;under: but when wee came to clo&s;e-hand-fight, &s;aid the Wa&s;termen, we made mo&s;t plea&s;ant pa&s;time and &s;port: Sport? cried out the other who had beene well ba|&s;ted with the ba&s;tinado: We for our parts found no &s;uch &s;port when we buckled togither, thus to be cudgelled: and with that &s;hewed on their armes, hands and necks, yea and &s;ome of them upon their faces the dry blowes of the ba&s;tons which they had received. And then verily they laughed heartily one at ano|ther as they might well enough. The day following, the whole field was full of men, who a&s;&s;ayed to imitate the&s;e in this manner of fight: and when they had no other weightier affaires in hand, they practi&s;ed evermore this kinde of game. Moreover, <HI>[Cyrus]</HI> having e&s;pied on a time another Centurion lea|ding his Centurie, one by one from a river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> to dinner, and when he &s;aw his time commanding the Caporalls to bring forward the hindmore band, the third
<PB N="49" REF="34">likewi&s;e and the fourth, in to the front: al&s;o, when as now the Caporals [or Leaders of the &s;aid bands] were all afront, how he bade them to double their fyles and lead every band by two and two. And &s;o thereupon, the Decurions brought forward their men afront accordingly: And when he thought it good againe, how he gave charge to lead their bands by foure and foure in ranke: whereupon the Quincurions went forward with their &s;ouldiers &s;o as that the band marched foure and foure in ranke. Al&s;o how after they were come once to their Pavilion doore, heeled the formo&s;t band in, commanding them to march two by two in ranke: willing withall the &s;econd to follow hard after in the very taile of the other: and having given the like charge to the third and fourth, how he led them in: And thus as he brought them in, how he cau|&s;ed them to &s;it downe to their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> meale even as they entred. <HI>Cyrus</HI> I &s;ay wonde|ring at this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Centuri|on.</NOTE> Captaine for his mildne&s;&s;e, his dexteritie in teaching, and dili|gence withall, invited this hundred al&s;o to &s;upper, with their Centinier. Now, there being then in place a certeine other Centurion, that was bidden to &s;upper; But, invite you not my Centurie, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> into your Pavilion? and yet, when he is at &s;upper he doth the very &s;ame every way: when &s;upper al&s;o is done, and the meeting di&s;&s;olved; the la&s;t Leader of the reare band bringeth forth his crew, having the la&s;t verily &s;et formo&s;t in array again&s;t they &s;hould fight: then after them, he likewi&s;e that leadeth the taile of the &s;econd crew: and &s;emblably the third and the fourth: to the end that when they are to be led away from the enemies, they might know how to retire. Furthermore, if we addre&s;&s;e out &s;elves for a running march, and be di&s;po&s;ed to journey: when&s;o|ever we &s;et out toward the Sun-ri&s;ing, I my &s;elfe lead the way, and the fir&s;t band goeth formo&s;t: then, the &s;econd keepeth his place, as is meet: the third like|wi&s;e and the fourth in order: as al&s;o the Decuries and Quicuries of every band, &s;o long as I bid them. But when we march toward the We&s;t [or Sun|&s;etting then the Caporall of the reare band and with him tho&s;e that be la&s;t, lead in the front: and yet they obey me neverthele&s;&s;e comming behind in the very taile: that they may be accu&s;tomed as well to follow, as lead with like o|bedience. And what! quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Doe ye alwaies practi&s;e this? Yea Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, quoth the &s;aid Captain, &s;o often and as duly as we go to our &s;uppers. I invite therefore you al&s;o, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> partly for that you yonder traine your &s;ouldiours &s;o preci&s;ely to keepe order in going and comming, in marching on and retiring, and partly becau&s;e you practi&s;e &s;o to doe both by day and night; and withall not onely exerci&s;e your bodies by journeying but al&s;o profit your minds by teaching. And now, for as much as yee doe every thing double, good rea&s;on it is that we &s;emblably make you double cheere. Not &s;o, for Gods &s;ake, &s;aith the Captaine, unle&s;&s;e you give us al&s;o two bellies apeece. And thus brake up their meeting in his Pavilion. The morrow after, <HI>Cyrus</HI> reinvited this Centurie to his Pavilion, according as he had &s;aid overnight, and &s;o the day following: Which when the re&s;t perceived, they all from that time forward imitated them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> How <HI>Cyaxares</HI> gave audience to the King of India his Emba&s;sadours and &s;ent them afterwards to the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Cyrus</HI> on a time was mu&s;tering all his &s;ouldiours in their armour and &s;etting them in order of battaile: there came a me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> adverti&s;ing him of an Emba&s;&s;age arrived from the Indians, and there|fore, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> his will is, &s;aith he, that you repaire unto him with all &s;peed. I have be&s;ide, quoth the me&s;&s;enger, brought unto you from <HI>Cyaxares</HI> a mo&s;t good|ly and faire robe: For, his de&s;ire is, that you &s;hould &s;hew your &s;elfe in mo&s;t magnificent and gorgeous manner, For that the Indians are to view and behold you as you come. <HI>Cyrus</HI> hearing this newes, gave commandement to the prin|cipall and formo&s;t Centinier, arraunged as he was in battaile ray, that &s;tanding him&s;elfe on the right hand, and leading his Centurie one by one, hee &s;hould place it afront: he willed him al&s;o to give the like charge unto the &s;econd: and &s;o, throughout them all hee bad him intimate &s;o much. Which order of his they obeyed, and as they quickly delivered this charge, &s;o they performed the &s;ame as &s;peedily. Thus within a &s;hort time, there &s;tood afront in ranke 200. For &s;o many Centiniers there were, and in depth one hundred. When they were thus placed, hee commaunded them to follow, as him&s;elfe led the way. And forthwith, he &s;et forward in a running march. But when he under&s;tood once, that the way leading to the Court, was &s;o narrow that it might not receive them marching all afront, he commaunded the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Formo&s;t.</NOTE> fir&s;t regiment of a thou&s;and to follow in their place, and the &s;econd to march after in the taile of it. And in this manner he went him&s;elfe alwaies formo&s;t, never re&s;ting betweene; and the other thou&s;ands followed every one hard at the heeles of the former. Moreo|ver, he &s;ent two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sargeants.</NOTE> Officers of purpo&s;e unto the entry of the way for to in&s;truct any one that was ignorant and to &s;eeke, what to doe. Now when they were come before the gates of <HI>Cyaxares</HI> his Palace, hee commaunded the formo&s;t Centurion to arrange his Companie &s;o, as they might &s;tand 12. in file, deep, and to place the leaders of every 12. afront before the Palace. The like charge he cau&s;ed to be given unto the &s;econd, and &s;o throughout to all. Which they did accordingly. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elfe to <HI>Cyaxares</HI> in a long <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> robe, nothing proud nor &s;umptuous. When <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;aw him, well plea&s;ed he was with this &s;peedy repaire that he made, but offended at the ba&s;ene&s;&s;e of his garment. How now <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth hee, what meane you by this, to &s;hew your &s;elfe in &s;o &s;imple habit before the Indians? I would have had you mo&s;t &s;tately and gloriou&s;ly to be &s;eene. For, an honour it would have beene to me, that you my &s;i&s;ters &s;onne had beene &s;et out and arrayed mo&s;t royally. To this <HI>Cyrus</HI> made an&s;wer in this wi&s;e. Whether &s;hould I have honoured you more, good Vnkle <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> if being clad in purple, putting on bracelets and wearing a colar about my necke, I have accompli&s;hed your will and commandement by lea&s;ure, or rather as now I doe, obey you &s;o &s;peedily with &s;o great and goodly a power, and all, to doe you honour; adorned (as you &s;ee) my &s;elfe, and &s;o adorning you with &s;wett and through diligence? teaching others al&s;o
<PB N="51" REF="35">thereby, to be likewi&s;e obedient unto you? Thus &s;pake <HI>Cyrus;</HI> and <HI>Cyaxares</HI> li|ked well of his &s;peech: and thereupon commaunded the Indians to be brought forward for audience: Who being come in place, The <HI>Indian</HI> King our Ma|&s;ter, &s;ay they, hath &s;ent us with commi&s;&s;ion, to demaund the cau&s;e, wherefore the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> make warre one again&s;t the other? and upon the hea|ring of your an&s;wer, he willed us to go on directly to the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King, and of him likewi&s;e to demaund the &s;ame: but in conclu&s;ion, to declare vnto you both: That the <HI>Indian</HI> King, upon con&s;ideration of right and Iu&s;tice, will take part with him that hath the wrong. To which Emba&s;&s;age <HI>Cyaxares</HI> returned this an&s;wer. Give eare then unto my words. No wrong at all doe wee unto the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King. And now, go your wayes yee may unto him, and enquire what he &s;aith. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> being there pre&s;ent, Plea&s;eth it you, quoth he unto <HI>Cyaxa|res,</HI> that I al&s;o may deliver mine opinion? Say on, quoth <HI>Cyaxares</HI> and &s;peake your minde.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> being in deliberation and conference with his Vnkle, as touching this Affaire, and about levying &s;ummes of money, enterpri&s;ed warre upon the King of <HI>Armenia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter that the <HI>Indian</HI> Emba&s;&s;adours were gone forth, <HI>Cyrus</HI> began to com|mune with <HI>Cyaxares</HI> in this manner. Sir, hither came I to you bringing from home with mee no great &s;tore of trea&s;ure properly mine owne: And how much &s;o ever it was, that I had, there is but very little left thereof, for that I have &s;pent it upon my &s;ouldiers: Now haply you marvaile how I have con&s;umed it, con&s;idering they are at your finding. But I would have you to know, that I have done nothing el&s;e therwith but be&s;towed it in gifts and re|wards, when&s;oever I admired any one of my &s;ouldiours: For, thus I thinke, That a man may better and with more plea&s;ure incite by faire language and well do|ing, rather than by hard dealing and compul&s;ion, all tho&s;e who&s;e helpe hee would u&s;e in any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e what&s;oever: &s;o likewi&s;e, he that is de&s;irous to have in warre affaires, willing and forward coadjutours, mu&s;t in my judgement, al|lure and winne them altogether with gracious words and liberall deeds. For, friends they mu&s;t be and not foes, who &s;hall unfainedly and without preten&s;e of excu&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t us in war, and fight by our &s;ide as who will never envie their Com|mander in weale, nor &s;hrinke and for&s;ake him in woe: Vpon the&s;e con&s;iderati|ons, me thinks I had need of much trea&s;ure. For, to have mine eye for every thing upon you, whom I perceive to be at very great expen&s;e, &s;eemeth to me ab&s;urd: And therefore, I deeme it meet both for you and me to con&s;ider up|on this point together in common, that you be not bare of money. For, if you be throughly &s;tored, well I wote, that I al&s;o may have my part thereof at my need when&s;oever: e&s;pecially, if I take the &s;ame to &s;uch an u&s;e, as the defraying thereof may turne to your better profit. I remember I heard you &s;ay of late,
<PB N="52" REF="36">that the <HI>Armenian</HI> King &s;lighteth you at this pre&s;ent, becau&s;e hee heareth &s;ay, there be enemies comming again&s;t us, and &s;o neither &s;endeth unto you an army, nor payeth you the tribute due, as he ought. Hee doth &s;o indeed good <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he. And therefore I &s;tand now in doubt, whether it were better for me to make warre upon him, and &s;o to try what I can doe by force: or now for my behoufe, to let him alone at this time, for feare wee make the number of our enemies the greater by him. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> replyed and asked, What! Doe the <HI>Armenians</HI> dwell in places &s;urely &s;ituate, or in &s;uch as be ea&s;ie of acce&s;&s;e? Sure|ly, an&s;wered <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> Their hou&s;es be not &s;eated very &s;trongly. For, I have not beene carele&s;&s;e in that behalfe. Howbeit there be certaine hils, into which if<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Armeni|an King.</NOTE> he retire, he may &s;traight-wayes be in &s;uch &s;afety as that he need not yeeld unto the enemy either him&s;elfe or what&s;oever he can convey thither, unle&s;&s;e he would beleaguer him a long time, with a &s;tanding campe, as my Father &s;ome|time did. Hereupon <HI>Cyrus</HI> inferred thus. If you will &s;end me, and give me the conduct of a troupe of hor&s;emen, &s;uch as you &s;hall thinke &s;ufficient, I tru&s;t with the leave and helpe of God, to cau&s;e the <HI>Armenian</HI> King both to &s;end unto you an army, and al&s;o to pay you the tribute. Yea, and I hope be&s;ides, that much more friendly he will be to us, than now he is. And even I too, quoth <HI>Cyaxa|res,</HI> am verily per&s;waded, that they will all rather come in and &s;ide with you than with us. For, I heare &s;ay, that &s;ome of the Kings children were wont to be your companions in hunting, who perhaps will joyne with you againe. But if &s;ome of them be &s;ubdued and brought under your hand, all things will &s;uc|ceed as wee would our &s;elves. How then, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> thinke you it not expe|dient to conceale the&s;e de&s;&s;ignes of ours? Yes truly, quoth <HI>Cyaxares;</HI> For, by this meanes, both &s;ome one of them we &s;hall take the &s;ooner, and al&s;o if a man &s;hould invade them, they might be &s;urprized le&s;&s;e provided. Li&s;ten then, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> whether I &s;hall &s;eeme unto you to &s;ay &s;omewhat to the purpo&s;e? Many a time have I, with all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that were with mee, hunted about the confines of your land and the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and otherwiles having joyned unto mee &s;ome hor&s;emen, (tho&s;e I meane who were my friends and familiars here in <HI>Media</HI>) made a journey thither. Therefore, quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> if you enterpri&s;e the like now, you &s;hould never be &s;u&s;pected. But if your forces appeare much greater, than you were wont to take with you a hunting, then it were very &s;u&s;pitious in|deed. Yet may we devi&s;e a pretty per&s;wa&s;ive preten&s;e quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> for this: Namely, if &s;ome one give it out and carry word thither, that I have a de&s;ire to make a great hunting, &amp; &s;eeme withal to crave openly of you certain hor&s;men. Well &s;aid of you, quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> and I my &s;elfe will not willingly graunt unto you but a meane &s;ort, making &s;emblance, as though I meant my &s;elfe, to goe unto my Forts and Ca&s;tles which frontier next unto <HI>A&s;&s;yria.</HI> For, in very truth, I intend a journey thither, to fortifie the &s;ame holds, and make them as &s;ure as po&s;&s;ibly I can. Now when you are &s;et forth with tho&s;e forces of your owne, and have hunted two daies, I wil &s;end unto you a &s;ufficient &s;trength of hor&s;e and foot, levied already about me: which when you have received, you may direct|ly make an inva&s;ion. And I for my part, ready to &s;econd you with the re&s;t of my forces, will doe my be&s;t not to bee farre from you; to the end that when I &s;ee my time, I may &s;hew my &s;elfe in the field. Thus <HI>Cyaxares</HI> a&s;&s;embled out of hand hor&s;emen and footmen both, for his holds: and withall &s;ent waggons be|fore with victuals, the very way that led to the &s;aid Forts. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> imme|diately
<PB N="53" REF="36">&s;acrificed in regard of this expedition, and therwith &s;ent unto <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> reque&s;ting that he might have the younger hor&s;emen: and notwith&s;tanding, many were ready to follow as voluntaries, yet he graunted unto him but few. When <HI>Cyaxares</HI> had now put him&s;elfe upon his way, with a power of foot and hor&s;e toward his fortre&s;&s;es, <HI>Cyrus</HI> hapned to have a lucky Sacrifice, pre&s;aging fortunate &s;ucce&s;&s;e in his journey again&s;t the Armenian [King]: and &s;o he &s;et forward, as one well appointed onely for to hunt. And as he marched on, be|hold in the very fir&s;t open field that he came into: he pre&s;ently &s;tarted an Hare: and with that an Aegle flying on the lucky hand; having e&s;pied the Hare run|ning, made wing, &s;trake her, caught her up, and away: Now when &s;hee had carried the Hare to the next hill top, &s;hee feized on her prey, as &s;hee would her &s;elfe. <HI>Cyrus</HI> ob&s;erving this &s;igne, rejoyced in his heart, and therewith wor&s;hip|ped Iupiter King, and &s;aid unto tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent: My friends, This will be I tru&s;t in God, a faire and plea&s;ant Chace. When they were come hard to the Frontiers, he hunted &s;treightwaies, as his manner was. And verily, the common &s;ort as well of footmen as of hor&s;emen, cour&s;ed and galloped to and fro, intending thereby to rou&s;e the Deere: but the be&s;t and chiefe of hor&s;e and foot both were divided, to &s;tand at the receit of the bea&s;t being once a-foot, and to follow the game. So within few houres, they tooke many wild Bores,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Stags.</NOTE> Harts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> fallow Deere, and wild A&s;&s;es. For, in the&s;e parts there be many &s;uch A&s;&s;es bred, even at this day. When they had given over hunting for that day, &s;o foone as he was entred into the marches of the Armenians, he &s;upped. The next day he hunted againe, approching night to tho&s;e mountaines, which hee de&s;ired to gaine: And here likewi&s;e after hee had done hunting hee tooke his &s;upper. But &s;o &s;oone as he di&s;covered the power that <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;ent, advancing neere at hand, he di&s;patched &s;ecrerly a me&s;&s;enger, willing them, to fall off, a|bout two para&s;angs from him, and there to goe to &s;upper: Fore&s;eeing, that this would much availe to conceale his comming from the enemies: And &s;o &s;oone as he had &s;upped, hee commaunded that their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Com|maunder.</NOTE> Captaine &s;hould repaire unto him. When &s;upper was done, he called likewi&s;e before him the Centurions, unto whom being pre&s;ent he &s;pake in this wi&s;e.</P>

<P>MY good friends, the Armenian King, hath before-time beene confede|rate with <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> and as a Tributary done homage unto him. But now, upon intelligence of our enimies comming, hee &s;etteth him at nought, and neither &s;endeth us an armie, nor payeth tribute, therefore mu&s;t we hunt him now if we can: and in this manner, quoth he, I thinke it good, that we proceed. You <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> after that you have gotten &s;ome moderate &s;leepe, take with you the one halfe of the Per&s;ians which are with us: enter the way of the mountaines and &s;eize tho&s;e hils fir&s;t, unto which, they &s;ay he u&s;eth to flie, when he is in feare: I my &s;elfe will give unto you guides for your better con|duct. And verily, the&s;e hils, by report, be &s;o thicke over&s;pred with trees, that I
<PB N="54" REF="37">hope yee &s;hall not be de&s;cried. Howbeit, if you &s;end forth before the armie, certeine nimble fellowes lightly appointed, re&s;embling both for number and apparell brigands and robbers: If they chance to light upon any of the Ar|menians, looke whom&s;oever they can catch, them will they be &s;ure to keepe and make &s;ure for telling tales: and whom they &s;hall not be able to take, they will yet hold them &s;o farre all of, as that they &s;hall not have a &s;ight of our maine hoa&s;t, but con&s;ult togither as touching you, as of theeves and none other. Thus I &s;ay, doe you. As for my &s;elfe, by day-breake, I will with the other moitie of the Infantery, and the whole Cavallery, take to the plaine and cham|pion way, marching directly to the Court where the King lyeth. Then, if he make head again&s;t us and re&s;i&s;t, it is a plaine ca&s;e, that of nece&s;&s;itie, fight wee mu&s;t. But &s;ay that he retireth and leaveth the even ground, evident then it is, that we are to cour&s;e and pur&s;ue him. Suppo&s;e he flieth to the hils, then quoth he, it will be your part, to let none of them e&s;cape that &s;hall come thither unto you. Make the ca&s;e thus, as in hunting: Imagine we be the hounds, that &s;eeke and finde out; and your &s;elfe the hunt&s;man, that keepeth by the net and toile. Remember therefore, that all the Avenues mu&s;t be &s;topped before the hunting is begun. Moreover, clo&s;e they ought to be and &s;ecret who are appointed to keepe the pa&s;&s;ages, in ca&s;e they would not have the wild bea&s;ts to be turned a|&s;ide that are running forth toward them. Howbeit, doe not you, good <HI>Chry|&s;antas,</HI> as you are wont &s;ometime to doe, for the love you have to hunting. For, often-time you pa&s;&s;e the whole night in bu&s;ine&s;&s;e without &s;leepe. But now, permit you mu&s;t your &s;ouldiers, to take their re&s;t moderately, that they may be able to fight again&s;t &s;leepe and re&s;i&s;t it. Neither (becau&s;e your &s;elfe can raunge and wander over the mountaines, having no men to be your guides, but the skill to follow that way whereas the bea&s;ts went before) may you therefore at this time, goe likewi&s;e in places hardly pa&s;&s;able: But give you charge unto your guides to lead you the ea&s;ie&s;t way, if &s;o be there be not ano|ther farre &s;horter. For, the ea&s;ie&s;t way, is the &s;peedie&s;t for an armie and &s;oone&s;t di&s;patched. Ne, yet mu&s;t you lead your men a running march, for that you have beene wont to runne over the hils: but &s;ee you goe before them a mode|rate pace, that the armie may conveniently follow. It were good al&s;o, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t able and forwarde&s;t men &s;taying behind, &s;hould encourage the o|ther; that when as afterward that wing pa&s;&s;eth on, which is to incite the re&s;t for to make &s;peed, all the &s;ouldiers therein compared to tho&s;e that goe an ordi|nary foot pace, may &s;eeme to runne. <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> having heard thus much, and ioying greatly in his heart, that he had received the&s;e adverti&s;ements from <HI>Cy|rus,</HI> tooke with him his guides, and departed. Now when he had told them that &s;hould goe with him, what they were to doe, he tooke his repo&s;e. After they had re&s;ted &s;o long as he thought meet, he advanced toward the hils. But <HI>Cyrus,</HI> by that time it was day-light, &s;ent a pur&s;uivant before unto the King of Armenia, with in&s;tructio~s to deliver this me&s;&s;age unto him &amp; to &s;ay, <HI>Cyrus</HI> com|mandeth you, &ocirc; King of Armenia, thus to doe: namely to repaire unto him with all &s;peed, bringing with you both your tribute &amp; al&s;o a power of men. If he aske you where I am? Tell truth and &s;ay, that I am within his marches. If he demand whether my &s;elfe am comming forward in per&s;on? An&s;were hereto al&s;o, and that truly, that you know not. But if he enquire, how many we are &s;trong? Bid him &s;end &s;ome men to know. Thus di&s;patched he the me&s;&s;enger away with this errand. For he thought it &s;tood better with courte&s;ie and humanitie, in this
<PB N="55" REF="37">wi&s;e to deale, than to come upon him at unwares without any warning. Him|&s;elfe being &s;ufficiently every way provided, both to goe through his journey, and al&s;o to fight if need required, &s;et forth and marched forward. But, hee made Proclamation before unto all his &s;ouldiers, That they &s;hould doe wrong to no per&s;on. And if any of them chaunced to light upon an Armenian, to bid him be of good cheere and feare nothing: and withall to permit every man that were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, to keepe mercate in tho&s;e places where they abode: with libertie to &s;ell at their plea&s;ure for money any victuals, (either meat or drinke) what&s;oever.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> without giving battaile, tooke the King of Armenia pri&s;oner, and &s;eized upon his goods. The di&s;cour&s;es that the &s;aid King made with his &s;onne <HI>Tigranes,</HI> about his deliverance.</HEAD>
<P>_CYRVS verily was thus bu&s;ied in the&s;e affaires. But the King of Armenia upon the mandate of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> delivered by his Herault, was much affrighted: con&s;idering e&s;peci|ally that he did wrong both in with-holding tribute, and al&s;o in not &s;ending an Armie. And this mo&s;t of all hee feared, lea&s;t he &s;hould be &s;eene for to have begun to build and fortifie his Palace &s;o, as it might be able to keepe out his enemies. Being therefore much perplexed by all the&s;e occa&s;ions: He &s;ent forth Commi&s;&s;ioners into divers parts [of his Kingdome] for to a&s;&s;emble his owne forces, and withall, conveied away into the mountaines his younger &s;onne <HI>Sabaris,</HI> his owne wife, his &s;onnes wife and his daughters, togither with their ornaments, furniture and Iewels of great valew, appointing a convoy of purpo&s;e to conduct them &s;afe. He made out al&s;o certeine men in e&s;piall, to &s;ee what <HI>Cyrus</HI> did; yea and did put in order of battaile tho&s;e Armenians who were come unto him. And within a while, others repaired unto him with newes, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> in per&s;on was at hand. But then, his heart would &s;erve him no longer for to try a battaile: and &s;o, &s;ecretly withdrew him&s;elfe out of the way. Now when the Armenians &s;aw him &s;o to doe, they al&s;o fled home eve|ry man, intending to remove their goods farther off. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, beholding the fields, how full they were of tho&s;e that ranne &s;traggling here and there &s;hifting
<PB N="56" REF="38">for them&s;elves, and driving before them their cattell, &s;ent after, and did them to under&s;tand, That he meant not to proceed in ho&s;tile manner again&s;t any one that would tarry: but if he tooke any flying away, hee denounced aforehand that he would deale with them as enemies. By this meanes the vulgar &s;ort, and the mo&s;t part &s;tayed: Howbeit, divers there were, that privily conveyed them|&s;elves away with the King. When as now they that were gone afore with the women, fell within the danger of them that kept the mountaines, they &s;et up by and by a great and piteous cry, and as they fled, very many of them were taken. In the end, the Kings &s;onne, the wives al&s;o and daughters afore&s;aid were taken captive, and all the goods and trea&s;ure &s;eized upon, which they had carryed with them. The King him&s;elfe, when hee under&s;tood what was be|falne unto them, being in doubt what to doe, and which way to turne him, fled up to a certeine hill top for to &s;ave him&s;elfe. Which <HI>Cyrus</HI> likewi&s;e &s;eeing, with the power he had about him, laid &s;iege to the hill round about: He &s;ent al&s;o to <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> willing him to abandon the Keeping of the fore&s;aid mountaine and to come unto him. Meane while that <HI>Cyrus</HI> his armie a&s;&s;embled, he &s;ent unto the Armenian King an Herald, by whom he demaunded the&s;e que&s;tions. Tell me directly, King of Armenia, whether you will remaine there &s;till to wre&s;tle and fight with hunger and thir&s;t, or come downe into the plaine and fight it out with us? The Armenian King and an&s;wered, that he would fight with neither. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ent eft-&s;oones and asked in the&s;e termes, Why then &s;it you there and come not downe? Becau&s;e, quoth he, I am to &s;eeke what to doe. But you neither need nor ought to doubt, replyed <HI>Cyrus;</HI> For you may come downe to plead your owne cau&s;e. And who &s;hall be our judge? &s;aith the King. Who but he? &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> unto whom God hath given power, without forme of law and judiciall proce&s;&s;e, to u&s;e you at his plea&s;ure? The King then, con&s;idering into what &s;treights he was driven, de&s;cended from the hill top. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> having taken both him and all other things al&s;o that he had, into the middle &s;pace betweene, environed them round within his tents; For, now by this time, had he all his forces about him. At this very in&s;tant, the Kings elde&s;t &s;onne, <HI>Tigranes,</HI> who before-time had accompanied <HI>Cyrus</HI> in hunting, was new|ly returned from a certeine journey: And hearing what occurrents were falne out, went directly, even as he was, to <HI>Cyrus.</HI> But &s;o &s;oone as he &s;aw his father and mother, his brethren, &s;i&s;ters, and his owne wife captives, he wept as good rea&s;on he had.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> when he beheld the man, u&s;ed no other complement of courte&s;ie and entertainment, but thus &s;aid unto him. Come you are in good &s;ea&s;on, that you may be pre&s;ent to heare your fathers cau&s;e tried. And therewith immediately he a&s;&s;embled together the Chiefetaines and Rulers, as well of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> as of the <HI>Medes:</HI> He called likewi&s;e to this Councell, as many of the Nobles and Honorable per&s;ons of <HI>Armenia</HI> as were pre&s;ent: The very women al&s;o being there in their Carroches he excluded not, but admitted them to the audience of his cau&s;e. Now, when he was provided accordingly and &s;aw his time, turning to the King of <HI>Armenia,</HI> thus began he to &s;peake. Fir&s;t, quoth hee, &ocirc; King of <HI>Armenia,</HI> I advi&s;e you in the deciding of this matter, to &s;peake the truth: that you may be cleere at lea&s;t of that one thing, which of all others de&s;erveth mo&s;t hatred. For, this would I have you to wit well, That to be taken with a lye, is the greate&s;t barre that men can have again&s;t obtaining of grace and pardon.
<PB N="57" REF="38">Morcover, even your children and the&s;e women here your wives: many <HI>Ar|menians</HI> al&s;o that be in place, are privie to you of all that which you have com|mitted: Who, if they perceive you to &s;peake otherwi&s;e than truth, will thinke that you judge your owne &s;elfe worthy to &s;uffer all extremities, when I &s;hall once finde out the truth. Propo&s;e then, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> what que&s;tions you will: For, utter the truth I &s;hall, come of it what will. Why then quoth <HI>Cy|rus.</HI> An&s;were directly unto me. Made you warre at any time upon <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> my mothers father and the re&s;t of the <HI>Medes?</HI> I did, &s;aid he. And when you were vanqui&s;hed by him, Did you not covenant and accept of the&s;e conditions: Im|primis, to yeeld him tribute. Item to aide him with men in his warres, when|&s;oever he gave you warning? and la&s;tly to hold no fortre&s;&s;es in your realme? It was even &s;o indeed, an&s;wered hee: Now therefore why have you fal&s;ified your faith, and neither tendred your tribute, nor &s;ent a power for aide, but have walled your forts? Becau&s;e, &s;aith he, I was de&s;irous of liberty. For, I thought it a noble thing both my &s;elfe to be free, and al&s;o to leave the &s;ame freedome to my children. Certes, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> a worthy matter it is for a man to endea|vour, that he may never come into bondage: but if one either defeated in war, or otherwi&s;e brought into &s;ervitude, be taken practizing to revolt and &s;hake off alleageance unto his Lords, tell me, you fir&s;t, doe you honour him as a good man and behaving him&s;elfe well, or puni&s;h him as a trangre&s;&s;our, after you have taken him? Surely I puni&s;h him quoth he. For you allow me not to lye. Then, an&s;wer me plainely and punctually quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> to the&s;e Interrogatories. If any man in place of authority and commaund under you, doe offend and deale unju&s;tly, &s;uffer you him to beare rule &s;till, or appoint you another in his roome? I place another, &s;aith he in his &s;tead. And, &s;ay, &s;uch an one be very wealthy and full of money; permit you him to be rich &s;till, or bring you him to pover|ty? I take from him quoth the King, what&s;oever he hath. If you under&s;tand that he fall away from you, and taketh part with the enemie, what doe you to him then? I put him to death, &s;aid he. For, why &s;hould I die convicted of lea&s;ing, rather than confe&s;&s;ing the truth? Then his &s;onne hearing the&s;e words plucked in peeces, the Turbant from about his owne head: and withall rent his mantell and upper garments. The women al&s;o piteou&s;ly cried out and tare them&s;elves, as if both father had beene even then condemned and a dead man, and all of them be&s;ides undone for ever. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> willing them to be &s;ilent, &s;aid thus againe. Well, be it &s;o, I have enough. The&s;e bee ju&s;t and rightfull cour&s;es in your owne practi&s;e, &ocirc; King of <HI>Armenia.</HI> But what would you coun|&s;ell us hereupon to doe? The <HI>Armenian</HI> held his tongue, as being doubtfull whe|ther he &s;hould advi&s;e <HI>Cyrus</HI> to put him to death, or teach contrary to that which he &s;aid him&s;elfe did. But his &s;onne <HI>Tigranes,</HI> demaunded of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and &s;aid. Tell me, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> (becau&s;e my father &s;eemeth to &s;tand in &s;u&s;pence) whether I &s;hall advi&s;e you concerning him what I thinke will be be&s;t and mo&s;t expedient for you to doe? <HI>Cyrus</HI> having ob&s;erved well enough, what time as <HI>Tigranes</HI> u&s;ed to hunt with him, that he entertained a certaine learned man, who was very fami|liar, and in wonderfull e&s;teeme with him, de&s;ired greatly to heare, what hee could &s;ay: and therefore bad him &s;peake his mind boldly. If you approve &s;aith <HI>Tigranes</HI> either the de&s;ignes by my father intended, or the acts by him already done, I advi&s;e you in any hand to imitate him: but if in your opinion he hath altogether faulted, I would give you coun&s;ell not to follow him. Then quoth
<PB N="58" REF="39"><HI>Cyrus,</HI> If I doe right, I may not in any wi&s;e take him doing thus ami&s;&s;e, for an en&s;ample. True, &s;aid <HI>Tygranes:</HI> By your rea&s;on then, inferred <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I mu&s;t pu|ni&s;h your Father, in ca&s;e it &s;tand with ju&s;tice to cha&s;tice a man that doth wrong. Yea, but whether thinke you it is better &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth <HI>Tigranes,</HI> to pro|ceed unto puni&s;hment with your owne good and profit, or to your owne hurt and detriment? Not thus, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus;</HI> for, &s;o, &s;hould I puni&s;h my &s;elfe. Yea quoth <HI>Tigranes</HI> and much hinder and endammage your owne e&s;tate, if at &s;uch a time you killed any of your liege men when they might &s;tand you in greate&s;t &s;tead to be kept alive. But how can tho&s;e men be prized &s;o high, when they be taken in the manner doing injurie? Yes verily as I thinke &s;aith <HI>Tigranes,</HI> if then, they may proove wi&s;e and &s;ound-hearted. For, this is mine opinion, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that without the mind be &s;ea&s;oned with prudence, no other vertue availeth ought. For what u&s;e can there bee of a &s;trong and &s;tout man, or of a valiant Knight? what profit may one make of a skilfull hor&s;eman if he be not wi&s;e and di&s;creet withall? Nay, what commodity may ari&s;e from a wealthy per&s;on, or a mighty man in a City, if di&s;cretion be away? But with wi&s;edome, every friend is profitable yea and every &s;ervant good and commodious. This is then, the meaning of your words quoth <HI>Cyrus:</HI> That your Father al&s;o even this day, is of an unwi&s;e and incon&s;iderate man, become wi&s;e and di&s;creet. Yes verily quoth he. Ergo you hold &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that &s;uch wi&s;edome and di&s;cretion, is an affecti|on of the mind, like as dolour and griefe, and not an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, pa&s;&s;ion, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> habit that may be lear|ned: For, if he ought fir&s;t to be made witty who afterward is to grow di&s;creet, one cannot all at once and &s;odainly of a fooli&s;h and witle&s;&s;e man become di&s;|creet. What! good <HI>Cyrus</HI> quoth he, did you never yet ob&s;erve, that one man in his folly taking in hand to fight with another better and mightier than him|&s;elfe, &s;o &s;oone as ever he was defeated, gave over &s;traightwaies that folly of his &s;hewed toward the other? Againe, have you never &s;eene that one City &s;tanding out again&s;t another, pre&s;ently after it hath beene conquered, chu&s;eth rather to obey that other, than to maintaine fight any longer? But what calamity of your fathers can you alleadge, that you may &s;o confidently avouch him to bee made wi&s;e and con&s;iderate? Even that, &s;aid <HI>Tigranes,</HI> whereby hee is privy to him&s;elfe, that for a greedy de&s;ire of liberty, hee is brought to that &s;ervitude, which he never felt before: and that he was not able to effect any of tho&s;e mat|ters which he thought either &s;ecretly to have held, or by &s;tealth to have com|pa&s;&s;ed, or by fine force to have brought to pa&s;&s;e. But he knoweth right well, that wherein &s;o ever you minded to deceive him, you have circumvented him &s;o, as a man would have deluded the blind or the dea&s;e, and tho&s;e that had no wit at all in the world: and what things &s;o ever you thought &s;hould be carried clo&s;ely, therein he knoweth full well you have beene &s;o &s;ecret, as that tho&s;e places which he &s;uppo&s;ed mo&s;t &s;afe and &s;ure for his refuge, you made the &s;ame his pri&s;ons to hold him fa&s;t ere he was aware. As for celerity, &s;o farre have you &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him, that comming as you did your &s;elfe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> from places farre re|mote with a pui&s;&s;ant armie, you prevented him before that he could bring his forces togither. And thinke you in very deed quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;uch a foyle as this, &s;ufficient to make men &s;o wi&s;e and wary, as to acknowledge others to be their betters and &s;uperiours? Yes verily &s;aid <HI>Figranes,</HI> and much more ywis than when a man is defaited in battaile. For, it falleth our otherwhiles, that a cham|pion once put to the wor&s;e by meere &s;trength, thinketh after he hath exerci&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Graec&egrave;, melius <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>
<PB N="59" REF="39">his body, to be better appointed, and to combate againe. Yea, and &s;ome cities forcel and wonne, having gotten fre&s;h aides, &s;uppo&s;e they are able to try it out eft&s;oones by a new conflict. But, looke whom&s;oever any &s;hall judge to be more vertuous and wi&s;er than them&s;elves, tho&s;e many times they are willing to obey, even vithout compul&s;ion. You &s;eeme then, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> not to thinke that in&s;o|lent and malapert per&s;ons take knowledge of any others more &s;taied and tem|perate than them&s;elves, nor theeves of true men, nor liers of truth &s;peakers, nor unju&s;t of tho&s;e that be righteous. And know you not, quoth he, that now al&s;o, your father hath dealt fal&s;ely, and not firmely ob&s;erved covenants with us, al|beit heknew, that wee for our parts have not broken the lea&s;t point and tittle, of tho&s;e Articles, which <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> agreed unto? Neither doe I my &s;elfe, quoth <HI>Tigranes</HI> &s;ay this, That it maketh men wi&s;e and con&s;iderate, barely to know their betters, unle&s;&s;e they &s;uffer puni&s;hment al&s;o at their betters hands: like as it is my fathers ca&s;e now. Yea, but your father, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> hath felt as yet no &s;mart at all. He &s;tands I know well in great feare, that he &s;hall be put to abide all extremities. And thinke you indeed quoth <HI>Tigranes</HI> that any thing doth ca&s;t men downe and &s;ubdue them more than &s;trong feare? or, wote you not, that tho&s;e who have felt the edge of the &s;word, (which of all puni&s;hments is thought to be the &s;harpe&s;t,) will never the le&s;&s;e encounter the &s;ame enemies againe who wounded them? But &s;uch per&s;ons as men doe mightily &s;tand in dread of, they can not endure to looke full upon, although they &s;peak comfortably unto them. This is then your &s;aying, is it not? quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> That men afraid of tor|ments, are more puni&s;hed already, than if they were tortured in very deed. Why! even your &s;elfe, quoth he, doth know, that I &s;ay truth, as well as I can tell you. For, well you wote, that &s;uch as feare to be bani&s;hed out of their na|tive countrey, &s;uch al&s;o as being to fight a field, are afraid of an overthrow, live in continuall angui&s;h. Semblably, they that &s;aile at &s;ea, &s;o long as they &s;tand in feare of &s;hipwracke: as many al&s;o as feare bondage and impri&s;onment, by rea&s;on of their feare can have no joy, nor receive benefit either of meat or &s;leep. Whereas &s;uch as be in exile, &s;uch as be defaited and brought into &s;ervi|tude already, can otherwhiles eate and drinke, yea and &s;leep better than tho&s;e which are in happy e&s;tate. Furthermore, it appeareth even in the&s;e per&s;ons more evidently, what a cumberous burden feare is. For, &s;ome fearing lea&s;t af|ter they be taken pri&s;oners they &s;hould bee put to death, die before, for very feare: partly by throwing them&s;elves downe headlong, partly by &s;trangling them&s;elves, and in part by cutting their owne throats: So that of all horrible things in the world, feare mo&s;t of all terrifieth mens minds. As for my father here, how is his heart now affected thinke you, &s;tanding as hee doth in feare of Captivitie, not only for him&s;elfe, but al&s;o for me, his wife and all his children? I can ea&s;ily beleeve in deed quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that he is in this maner much di&s;quie|ted: yet am I of this opinion, that incident it is to one and the &s;ame man, in pro|&s;perity to be proud and in&s;olent: but in calamity to be &s;odainly dejected &amp; &s;oone ca&s;t downe: howbeit, if upon pardon he recover and be rai&s;ed up, eft&s;oones to looke aloft, to waxe high minded, and ready to &s;tirre up new troubles againe. True it is &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> quoth <HI>Tigranes,</HI> Our offences are &s;uch as give good occa&s;ion, why we &s;hould no more be tru&s;ted: howbeit in your power it is, both to for|tifie your ca&s;tles with &s;trong wals, and al&s;o to keepe with garri&s;on your fen&s;ed holds, yea and to take what pledges and a&s;&s;urance you will, of our fealty. And
<PB N="60" REF="40">verily, quoth he, &s;uch per&s;ons you &s;hall have of us, as will not greatly grieve hereat. For, call to mind wee &s;hall, that our &s;elves are the cau&s;e of our owne woes.</P>
<P>But when you have made over the government of this State, to any one of tho&s;e that never tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t you, if your &s;elfe &s;hall &s;eeme then di&s;tru&s;tfull, take heed, lea&s;t as you gratifie and plea&s;ure them; &s;o they withall take you to be no friend of theirs. Againe, while you would be thought to avoid the in|curring of their hatred, if you lay no yoke upon them for to keep them under, &s;o, as that they can commit no in&s;olent parts; beware that hereafter you have not more need to reclaime them, than now you have to reduce us unto goodne&s;&s;e and order. But, for mine owne part quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;o God me helpe, I have me thinks no minde at all, to put &s;uch mini&s;ters in tru&s;t, whom I know to &s;erve me upon compul&s;ion. But, as for tho&s;e, whom I perceive, upon good will and love unto me, ready to doe their devoir, I &s;uppo&s;e I can better beare with them, de|linquent though they be, than &s;uch as hate me, doe they never &s;o well, and per|forme all double diligence upon con&s;traint and nece&s;&s;ity.

Even of tho&s;e I think, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who never were my profe&s;&s;ed enemies, &s;o I would be beneficiall unto them, as you are de&s;irous now I &s;hould be unto you. Why! can you find any man, good <HI>Cyrus</HI> quoth hee, at this time, unto whom you may be &s;o bounteous as unto my father? Say, you &s;uf|fer &s;ome one to live, who never did you wrong; what thanks &s;uppo&s;e you will he render unto you? Or, if you bereave him not of wife and children? who will in this regard affect you more than he, who thinks him&s;elfe to de&s;erve no le&s;&s;e than to loo&s;e the &s;ame? And know you any man that is like to &s;orrow more, if he hold not the Kingdome of <HI>Armenia,</HI> than we? Evident therefore it is, quoth he, that unto whom mo&s;t angui&s;h and griefe &s;hall redound, if he be not King, the &s;ame al&s;o if he receive of you the Kingdome, will yeald unto you the greate&s;t thanks. Moreover, if you have any care of this al&s;o, namely to leave the State here at your departure in lea&s;t trouble; con&s;ider quoth he, whether you thinke all will be more quiet, by innovation and change of the Government under a new Lord, or by &s;uffering the old and received manner to remaine &s;till in force un|der their ancient Prince?

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> with great humanitie did &s;et the King of Armenia with his wife and children at large: And after he had received their ran&s;ome, levied a good power of footmen and hor&s;emen both, out of Armenia for this warre.</HEAD>
<P>CYRVS was exceeding glad to heare him make this &s;peech: for that he thought now all was done and di&s;patched to his hand, which he un|dertooke unto <HI>Cyaxares</HI> for to performe: For, he called to minde what he had &s;aid, and namely how he thought to make the Armenian King, a more fa&s;t and a&s;&s;ured friend unto him, than before. Hereupon he demaunded of the King him&s;elfe in this manner. Tell me then, quoth he, &ocirc; King of Armenia, In ca&s;e I &s;hould conde&s;cend unto your reque&s;ts, how great an armie will you &s;end with me, and how much mony will you contribute toward this warre? Where|unto the Armenian King made this an&s;wer, I can &s;ay nothing unto you good <HI>Cyrus</HI> either in termes more plainly, or to the point more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> ju&s;tly, the~ to declare unto you fir&s;t, all the forces that I have: which when you &s;ee and know what they be, you may have away with you as great a power as you li&s;t, leaving as much as may &s;erve for the defence of the land. Then, for mony likewi&s;e, meet it is that I &s;hould &s;hew unto you all the trea&s;ure that I have, whereof you may take and leave what you thinke good. Goe to then, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus:</HI> Shew unto me directly what your &s;trength is, and tell mee withall, what &s;tore of coine you have. Hereto the Armenian King returned this an&s;wer. Of hor&s;emen the Ar|menians are able to make 8000, and of footmen 40000. As for mony, quoth he, togither with the trea&s;ures which my father left unto me, being reckoned to the true rate or valew in &s;ilver, it amounteth to more than 3000 talents. Here|unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as one in this behalfe nothing care-le&s;&s;e &s;aid thus: Of your armie then, becau&s;e the Chaldees your borderers make warre upon you, &s;end with me the one halfe: but of your monies, for tho&s;e 50 talents which you paid as a tribute, deliver double &s;o much unto <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> in regard of deteining the payment thereof: And to my &s;elfe you &s;hall lend another hundred talents. For the lone whereof, I promi&s;e, If God &s;peed me, either to doe you greater plea|&s;ures, or el&s;e to repay you the mony, if I be able. If I doe not, thought haply I may be un&s;ufficient, but judged, worthily, I &s;hall never be unju&s;t. Now for Gods &s;ake &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;aid the Armenian King, u&s;e not the&s;e words: otherwi&s;e, you &s;hall not have me &s;o confident and tru&s;tfull in you. But make this accompt, quoth he, What monyes &s;o ever you leave us, they are yours no le&s;&s;e, than tho&s;e which you carry from hence. Well &s;aid <HI>Cyrus:</HI> But how much mony will you part withall unto me, for to have your wife againe? Even as much, quoth he, as I am worth. And what will you give me to enjoy your children al&s;o? As much for them likewi&s;e as I can make. By this reckoning then inferred <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the&s;e be pri&s;ed at twice &s;o much as you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e. Now, <HI>Tigranes,</HI> to you I ad|dre&s;&s;e my &s;peech. With what ran&s;ome would you redeeme your wife? (newly married he was and loved the woman exceeding well) I a&s;&s;ure you, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, I would lay downe my very life that &s;he might never become thrall. Take her to you, then quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> For yours &s;he is: neither doe I repute her
<PB N="62" REF="41">to have beene a captive at all, &s;eeing you never fled from us. You al&s;o, King of Armenia, have away with you both your wife and children without any ran|&s;ome at all, that they may know they come unto you free. And now verily for this pre&s;ent take your &s;uppers with us: and when yee have &s;upped: Depart whither yee li&s;t. So they &s;tayed. But after &s;upper, whiles they were yet in the pavilion, <HI>Cyrus</HI> que&s;tioned in this manner, Tell me <HI>Tigranes,</HI> quoth he, what is become of the Gentleman that was wont to hunt with us: For you highly e|&s;teemed him. Why? quoth he, hath not this my father here put him to death? Of what offen&s;e &s;aid <HI>Cyrus</HI> was he convict? Hee laid to his charge, quoth he, that he corrupted me, And yet my deere <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;o good a man he was and &s;o hone&s;t, that even then, when he was to die, he called unto mee and &s;aid: Bee not you greived <HI>Tigranes</HI> and offended with your father, in that he mindeth to take away my life: For he doth not this in any malice, but of errour and igno|rance: And what tre&s;pa&s;&s;e men upon errour doe commit, I &s;uppo&s;e is done a|gain&s;t their wils. At the&s;e words &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Alas good man that he was. But the Armenian King turning unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;pake in this wi&s;e, Neither doe tho&s;e, good <HI>Cyrus</HI> who take other men naught with their wives pur&s;ue them there|fore to death, for that they make their wives more wanton and uncha&s;t; but becau&s;e they thinke they &s;teale away their hearts and quench that love which they owe unto them: in which regard, they proceed again&s;t them as very ene|mies. And even &s;o, Ielous was I and envied that man, becau&s;e me thought he was the cau&s;e that my &s;onne admired and e&s;teemed him more than my &s;elfe. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> So God me love good King of Armenia, as I thinke your fault was no other than any man would have done. Therefore <HI>Tigranes</HI> pardon your Fa|ther for this Gentlemans death. Thus having at that time di&s;cour&s;ed, lovingly entertained and embraced one another, as meet it was, after this reconciliation, they mounted upon their carroches togither with their wives and &s;o with great joy departed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> tooke <HI>Tigranes</HI> with him in his traine, and went to a&s;&s;aile the Chaldees upon the mountaines.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they were come home, &s;ome made report of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his wi&s;e|dome, others related his patience and &s;ufferance: one &s;pake of his mildne&s;&s;e, another of his beautie and goodly tall pre&s;ence. Where|upon <HI>Tigranes</HI> asked his owne wife and &s;aid: How now my Armenian Ladie, Seemed <HI>Cyrus</HI> in your eyes al&s;o a faire and beautifull per&s;onage? In good faith, quoth &s;he, I never looked upon him. Whom then did you behold, &s;aid <HI>Ti|granes?</HI> Even him I a&s;&s;ure you, quoth &s;he, who &s;aid, That with the price of his life he would redeeme mee from captivitie. And then, as meet it was, after &s;uch matters as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ed, they tooke their re&s;t togither. The day following, the Armenian King &s;ent unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> and the whole armie, gifts and tokens of ho&s;pi|talitie. He gave warning al&s;o to his owne &s;ubjects, &s;uch as were to goe to warfare, for to be ready again&s;t the third day following. As for the money whereof <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;pake, he payed it downe double. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> when he had ta|ken of it &s;o much as he required, &s;ent backe the re&s;t: and demaunded withall,
<PB N="63" REF="41">whether of them twaine would lead the armie? The &s;onne, or him&s;elfe? Whereunto both of them made an&s;were: the father in this wi&s;e: Even hee whom you &s;hall commaund; but the &s;onne after this &s;ort. As for mee &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> I will not leave you, no though I &s;hould follow you hard at heeles as a Campe drudge. Hereat <HI>Cyrus</HI> laughed heartily and &s;aid. And how much would you be content to give, for to have your wife heare you are become a Campe &s;lave and to carry fardels? Shee &s;hall never need, quoth he, to heare that. For I will bring her along with me, that &s;hee may &s;ee what ever I doe. But now &s;aid <HI>Cy|rus</HI> it were time for you to tru&s;&s;e up and be furni&s;hed every way for this jour|ney. I make full accompt quoth <HI>Tigranes</HI> that we &s;hall &s;hew our &s;elves in rea|dine&s;&s;e, with what&s;oever my father hath allow'd. And &s;o for that time the &s;ol|diers after gifts of friendly entertainment be&s;towed upon them, went to re&s;t. The next day <HI>Cyrus</HI> taking to him <HI>Tigranes</HI> with the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;elect hor&s;e|men of the Medes, as many al&s;o of his owne friends as he thought convenient, rode abroad to view the country of Armenia, devi&s;ing where he might build a fortre&s;&s;e. And being mounted up to an hill top, hee asked <HI>Tigranes,</HI> which were tho&s;e mountaines from whence the Chaldees u&s;ed to make rodes downe into the plaines, and &s;o to drive away booties? Which when <HI>Tigranes</HI> had &s;hewed unto him, he asked againe, whether tho&s;e mountaines were now with|out companie and unfrequented? No verily, quoth he, for they have alwaies certeine &s;pies and Sentinels, who &s;ignifie to the re&s;t what&s;oever they di&s;cover. And what doe they, &s;aith he, when they have notice of any thing? Every man &s;aith <HI>Tigranes</HI> makes what ha&s;t he can up to the hill tops for to help and &s;uccor. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard this, and withall beheld the country all about, he might per|ceive that a great part thereof, lay as wa&s;t ground to the Armenians, and un|tilled, by rea&s;on of the warres. Then for that time returned they to the armie, and after &s;upper tooke their repo&s;e and &s;lept. The morrow next en&s;uing, <HI>Ti|granes</HI> &s;hewed him&s;elfe ready and well appointed, having rai&s;ed a power of foure thou&s;and Hor&s;emen, with ten thou&s;and Archers and as many Targuati|ers. But whiles the&s;e forces were a levying, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;acrificed, and &s;eeing the en|trails of the bea&s;ts to be faire and fortunate to him, he called togither the Lea|ders both of the Per&s;ians and of the Medes, and in the pre&s;ence of that A&s;&s;em|bly made this &s;peech. My welbeloved friends, The&s;e mountaines that we &s;ee, belong to the Chaldaees, which if we may fir&s;t be ma&s;ters off, and on the top of them build a fort and plant our garri&s;on: of nece&s;&s;itie, as well the Chaldaees as the Armenians will demeane them&s;elves loyally toward us. As for our &s;a|crifices, they betoken all good on our &s;ide: and as touching mans alacritie and humane meanes, nothing will &s;o much help the &s;ame forward to the atchieving of this exploit, as expedition. For, if we can climb up the hils, before the ene|mies a&s;&s;emble their power, we &s;hall either gaine the hill tops wholly without any re&s;i&s;tance, or el&s;e skirmi&s;h with our enemies, when they are but few in number and feeble in &s;trength. No labour therefore can be ea&s;ier and more void of daunger, than if pre&s;ently we be re&s;olute in celeritie and quicke di&s;|patch. Arme your &s;elves therefore, on all hands. As for you the Medes, march on our left hand: but yee the Armenians, goe one halfe of you on the right &s;ide: and the other halfe lead the way in the vaward before us. Yee that bee hor&s;emen, follow behind in the Rear, to incite and put us forward up the hill, neither &s;uffer yee any one faintly to draw backe. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had thus &s;aid, and
<PB N="64" REF="42">arraunged his files directly upward; hee advaunced before the Armie. The Chaldees, [that lay in e&s;piall when they perceived the march forcibly to mount up hill, forthwith &s;ignified &s;o much to their fellowes, and &s;o, by out|cries and alarmes from one to another, they drew togither. <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o for his part gave warning to his &s;oldiers &s;aying. The&s;e here, &ocirc; yee Per&s;ians, &s;ignifie unto us that it is high time to make ha&s;t. For, if we prevent them, and get the hill before, our enemies &s;hall be little able to doe ought. Now the Chaldaees had light bucklers, and two javelins apeece: and the&s;e are reputed the mo&s;t martiall men of all that country. They &s;erve al&s;o in warres as mercenaries and be alwaies in pay, when&s;oever any man hath need of them, becau&s;e, warlike though they be and valiant, yet are they poore and needy. For, the region which they inhabite is full of hils, and a &s;mall part thereof welthy. Now when the &s;oldiers about <HI>Cyrus</HI> approched neerer to the hill-tops, <HI>Tigranes,</HI> who accom|panied <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Wote you not &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> quoth he, that we mu&s;t fight out of hand: and the Armenians will not abide the fir&s;t brunt of the enemies? <HI>Cyrus</HI> an&s;we|red that he was not ignorant thereof: in which regard I have already &s;aith he given order to the Per&s;ians to prepare them&s;elves and be in readine&s;&s;e. For they are to follow hard, &s;o &s;oone as the Armenians begin to give ground and there|by draw the enemies neerer unto us. Thus the Armenians advanced formo&s;t in the vantguard. But the Chaldaees, as many as were pre&s;ent, upon the approach of the Armenians &s;odainly &s;etting up a &s;hout, ru&s;hed fiercely upon them after their manner and gave the charge. The Armenians likewi&s;e, as they were wont, received them not, but reculed. Now when the Chaldaees following them in chace, perceived others with &s;word in hard to mount up the hill ready to encounter them afront, &s;ome that hapned to joyne in fight were quickly &s;laine, others e&s;caped by flight, and certeine of them were taken pri&s;oners. Thus the hill tops were &s;oone gain'd. Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> his &s;ouldiers were gotten up thither, and looked downe toward the habitations of the Chaldaees, they might perceive how they abandoned the hou&s;es that &s;tood next, and &s;o ran away. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, as &s;oone as all his &s;oldiers were come togither, commaunded them to take their dinners: After dinner, having learned that the place of E&s;piall where the Chaldaees lay, was both &s;afe and al&s;o well watered, pre&s;ently hee emmured it in manner of a fortre&s;&s;e. Hee commaunded al&s;o <HI>Tigranes</HI> to &s;end unto his father, willing, and requiring him to make pre&s;ent repaire thither, and to bring with him all the Carpenters and Ma&s;ons that were to bee had. So there was a me&s;&s;enger &s;treight-wayes di&s;patched unto the Armenian King. Meane while <HI>Cyrus</HI> with tho&s;e about him began to build the wall. At which very time, they pre&s;ented the captives unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;ome bound, and others of them &s;ore wounded. Whom when he beheld, he commaunded immediately the bound to be loo&s;ed, and &s;uch as were hurt to be cured. For which purpo&s;e, he had &s;ent for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Chirur|gions.</NOTE> Phy&s;icians. This done, hee &s;aid unto the Chaldaees, that his comming was not either for any de&s;ire he had to de&s;troy them, or need to make warre: but becau&s;e he would conclude a Peace betweene the Armenians and the Chaldaees. And before that I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e hill tops, quoth he, I wote well yee had no de&s;ire of peace. For why? Your owne State was in &s;afety, and the goods of the Armenians yee harried and carried at your plea|&s;ure. But now yee &s;ee in what ca&s;e yee &s;tand. I di&s;mi&s;&s;e you therefore that be pri&s;oners, home to your hou&s;es, and give you leave to con&s;ult with the re&s;t of
<PB N="65" REF="42">the Chaldaees, whether yee will maintaine warre again&s;t us, or enterteine amity with us. If yee make choice of warre, See ye come not hither, if ye be wi&s;e, without armes and weapons, but if yee thinke yee have need of peace, come hardly unarmed. Will yee become our friends? I will then take care for the &s;afetie and wellfare of your &s;tate. The Chaldaees hearing this, after they had highly prai&s;ed <HI>Cyrus</HI> and on all &s;ides given him their hands, departed home.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> The peaceable communication that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had with the Armenians and the Chaldaees. The mutuall accord and peace betweene them all.</HEAD>
<P>THE Armenian King when he heard that <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ent for him, and with|all what he had done, taking with him the Carpenters and Ma&s;ons afore&s;aid, and all other things which he thought nece&s;&s;ary, repaired un|to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> withall &s;peed po&s;&s;ible. No &s;ooner &s;aw hee him, but hee brake out into the&s;e words: Little it is &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that wee men are able to fore&s;ee in future things, and yet attempt and enterpri&s;e many de&s;&s;eins. For, ere while, my &s;elfe, when I went about to compa&s;&s;e my libertie, became a &s;lave more then ever be|fore: and after that wee were taken pri&s;oners, whiles wee made full accompt that wee were utterly undone, it appeareth now mo&s;t evidently, that wee are pre&s;erved, no time before, &s;o much. For, tho&s;e who never cea&s;&s;ed to infe&s;t us many wayes, I &s;ee now to be in that ca&s;e, which I ever wi&s;hed. And thus much &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> I would have you to know, that for to di&s;&s;eize the Chaldaees of the&s;e mountaine tops, I would have disbur&s;ed much more mony, than your &s;elfe have of mee. And verily the good turnes which you promi&s;ed to doe unto us, what time you received that mony, you have performed already. We acknowledge our &s;elves therefore to be debters unto you &s;till for other benefits: Which (if we would not be naughtie per&s;ons) it were a &s;hame for us not to requite. And what requitall &s;oever we make, yet &s;hall wee not be found to have made con|digne recompen&s;e, be&s;eeming &s;o beneficiall a friend. Thus &s;pake the King of Armenia. But the Chaldaees came unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> as Oratours, be&s;eeching him to make peace with them: whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> que&s;tioned with, in this wi&s;e. Crave yee peace at this time yee Chaldaees, for any thing el&s;e, but that yee thinke to live in more &s;ecuritie by peace than by warre? con&s;idering that wee al&s;o &s;aid as much. The Chaldaees made an&s;were, Yea; for, all other things we have al|ready. But what and if, replied <HI>Cyrus,</HI> there accrue unto you other commodi|ties be&s;ide, by the meanes of peace? Then, &s;aid they, would wee be the glad|der. And what other rea&s;on is there, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> why you repute your &s;elves now to be poore, but for lacke of rich and and fertile ground? When they ac|corded to him in this point al&s;o. How then? would yee be content, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to pay &s;o much tribute as the other Armenians doe, &s;o ye may lawfully occupy and till as much Armenian ground as yee will your &s;elves? Yes, right willing|ly an&s;wered the Chaldaees, if we might beleeve, we &s;hould &s;u&s;teine no wrong hereafter. And what &s;ay you, King of Armenia, would you have this ground of yours that now lieth wa&s;t, to become tilled, provided, that the occupiers thereof pay you &s;uch rent as you &s;et downe? Yes verily, quoth the King, I
<PB N="66" REF="43">would give a great deale of that condition. For, by this meanes the revenues of my Crowne &s;hould be much augmented. And yee Chaldaees, quoth he, what &s;ay yee to this, con&s;idering yee have fertile mountaines, would yee willingly permit the Armenians to u&s;e the &s;ame for pa&s;ture, yeelding unto you for the pa|&s;turage a rea&s;onable rent? Yea gladly, &s;aid the Chaldaees, for that we &s;hall re|ceive much profit without any paine and labour. But you King of Armenia, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> are you willing to u&s;e their pa&s;tures, if for a &s;mal commoditie ari&s;ing unto the Chaldaees, your &s;elfe may receive farre greater profits? Yea, with all my heart, quoth he, if I thought I might enjoy the &s;aid pa&s;ture-ground in &s;afe|tie without mole&s;tation. What! might yee not enjoy them &s;afely, if yee had the helpe of the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll-tops? Yes &s;aid the King. Hereat the Chaldaees. But we, par-die, &s;hall never be able to occupie, wee will not &s;ay, their grounds, but not &s;o much as our owne lands, if &s;o be the&s;e be ma&s;ters of the &s;aid hill tops. But, What! quoth he, if tho&s;e mountaines may helpe you? Mary, then, an&s;wered they, we &s;hould thinke our &s;elves well apayed. But it were not &s;o good for us, beleeve me &s;aid the King, in ca&s;e they recover the mountaines againe, e&s;pecially being walled and fortified. Well then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I will take this cour&s;e. The &s;trength of the&s;e hill-tops will I deliver to neither of you both: But wee our &s;elves will hold them in our owne hands; And whether of you wrong the other, their parts will we take who &s;u&s;teine the wrong. Which when both &s;ides heard: they prai&s;ed the devi&s;e, and &s;aid it was the onely way to e&s;tabli&s;h an a&s;|&s;ured peace. So upon the&s;e capitulations following, they all gave and received interchangeably ho&s;tages for &s;ecuritie: and agreed it was betweene them, That they both, &s;hould be free one from the other, enterteine mutuall marriages, u&s;e tillage and pa&s;ture in common indifferently: and one aid the other if any did mole&s;t either of them. Thus for that time things pa&s;&s;ed: and the league then and thus concluded, betweene the Chaldaees and the Soueraine Ruler of Ar|menia, remaineth yet in force to this day. Now after the&s;e Covenants of con|federacy were confirmed, both parts immediately did put to their helping hands with great cheerefulne&s;&s;e, to build and wall the &s;aid fortre&s;&s;e as a com|mon &s;trength and defen&s;e for them both, and thereto joyntly brought all things nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ent an Emba&s;sage unto the Indians: and returning into Media, con&s;ulted about making warre upon the A&s;&s;yrians.</HEAD>
<P>WHen evening drew neere, <HI>Cyrus</HI> entertained togither with him at &s;upper both parties, as being now joyned in mutuall amity. And as they &s;at at &s;upper, one of the <HI>Chaldaees</HI> began and &s;aid: This ac|cord may well be acceptable to all others of our nation. But &s;ome <HI>Chaldaees</HI> there are quoth he, that live by preading and robbing, who neither have skill of husbandry, nor can abide to till the ground, as wonted alwaies to get their li|ving by the warres. For, they u&s;ed evermore to drive away booties, and many a time to &s;erve for wages under the King of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who by their &s;aying is a Potentate full of gold, and as often under King <HI>A&s;tyages.</HI> Why then, &s;aid <HI>Cy|rus,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="43">doe they not take wages of me? For I will give them as good pay, as hee, who ever he be that gave mo&s;t. This offer of <HI>Cyrus</HI> they accepted and &s;aid, that many would bee right willing to &s;erve him. And thus of the&s;e points above|&s;aid were they agreed. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, who had heard &s;ay that the <HI>Chaldaees</HI> often|times had recour&s;e unto the <HI>Indian</HI> King; and calling to remembrance, that from him there came to the <HI>Medes</HI> certaine per&s;ons as Spies to &s;ee and learne what was done among them, and the &s;ame afterwards went al&s;o to the enemies, for to have intelligence likewi&s;e of their affaires, was willing enough that the <HI>Indian</HI> King might know what deeds him&s;elfe had atchieved: And therefore he entred into &s;uch a &s;peech as this. Tell me &ocirc; King of <HI>Armenia</HI> and yee <HI>Chaldaees,</HI> If I &s;hould di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger of mine, unto the <HI>Indian</HI> King, would ye &s;end any of vours be&s;ides, who might both conduct the man in his way, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him al&s;o to the obtaining at the &s;aid Kings hand, of &s;uch things as I de&s;ire? For, I gladly would, we had more money &s;til, to the end that I might both give large pay to as many as have need, and al&s;o by bountifull gifts grace and honour &s;uch as &s;erve under me, according to their worthine&s;&s;e. In the&s;e regards I &s;ay, de&s;i|rous I am to be furni&s;hed with great &s;tore of trea&s;ure. And, albeit I make recko|ning to &s;tand in need, yet gladly doe I &s;pare your monies whom I &s;uppo&s;e now to be our friends: yet, of the <HI>Indian</HI> King I would willingly take the &s;ame, if he would part with it. As for the &s;aid me&s;&s;enger, unto whom I will and re|quire you to allow guides for his conduct, and to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant when he is thither come, he &s;hall &s;peake in this wi&s;e, <HI>Cyrus</HI> hath &s;ent me unto you &ocirc; King of <HI>India,</HI> &s;aying that he &s;tands in need of more money: For that he expecteth another army from home out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> (and in very deed quoth he, &s;o I doe.) If there|fore you will &s;end him as much money as you thinke good, he &s;aith, that if God give him good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, he will endevour &s;o to doe, as that you &s;hall thinke you have done very well and wi&s;ely for your &s;elfe, in gratifying him thus in this kind. This me&s;&s;age &s;hall my Agent deliver from me. Now, for tho&s;e whom yee &s;hall &s;end, give them in charge and commi&s;&s;ion, what your &s;elves &s;hall thinke requi&s;ite. And if, quoth he, we may get money of him, we &s;hall have the grea|ter &s;tore by us to u&s;e. If not, we &s;hall know that we are nothing beholden to him nor have any cau&s;e to thanke him, but may for ought that concerneth him, order all things to our owne behoufe. Thus &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that tho&s;e <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Chaldaees</HI> who were to goe this journey, would make &s;uch reports of him, as him&s;elfe de&s;ired, that all the world &s;hould both &s;peake and heare. And &s;o for that time when they &s;aw good, they di&s;&s;olved this meering at &s;up|per and went to bed. The day following <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ent away the Me&s;&s;enger with tho&s;e directions which he had delivered before. The King of <HI>Armenia</HI> likewi&s;e and the <HI>Chaldaees</HI> appointed &s;uch per&s;ons to accompanie him as they thought mo&s;t meet to helpe forward the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e which they had in commi&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o to give out of <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;uch &s;peeches as were befitting. After this, when <HI>Cy|rus</HI> had fini&s;hed the fortre&s;&s;e and furni&s;hed it with garri&s;on &s;ouldiours, as ma|ny as were &s;ufficient, and with all things el&s;e nece&s;&s;arie; yea and left as Captaine over them a <HI>Median,</HI> (in preferring whom he thought to gratifie <HI>Cyaxares</HI> mo&s;t) he departed; leading away with him that armie which he had brought thither; as al&s;o tho&s;e forces which he received from the <HI>Armenian</HI> King, and together with them &s;uch as came from the <HI>Chaldaees,</HI> to the number of 4000. who of all
<PB N="68" REF="44">the parts inhabited, there was not an <HI>Armenian,</HI> man or woman that &s;taied with|in doores, but they all went forth to meet him, rejoycing greatly at this peace: bringing with them and driving before them, what thing &s;o ever any of them had worth pre&s;enting unto him. Neither was the King of <HI>Armenia</HI> herewith di&s;plea&s;ed; for that he thought <HI>Cyrus</HI> would take the more contentment, in be|ing thus generally honoured of all. In the end came forth likewi&s;e his Queene, with her daughters and younger &s;onne. And be&s;ide other gifts, &s;hee brought that gold al&s;o which before time <HI>Cyrus</HI> refu&s;ed to take. All which when <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aw, Yee &s;hall never quoth he make me &ocirc; <HI>Armenians,</HI> for hire and reward &s;ake to goe from place to place, and be&s;tow my favours. And you Madame, goe your waies and keepe the money that you bring, to your &s;elfe, and give it no more to the King your husband, for to bee buried in the ground: but rather, therewith &s;et out your &s;onne right gallantly, and &s;o &s;end him forth to the wars. Of all the re&s;t, for your &s;elfe, your husband, your daughters and &s;onnes, have and hold &s;o much, as by the enjoying thereof and adorning your &s;elves there|with, you may lead a more deinty and plea&s;ant life: and let it &s;uffice, quoth he, for the bodies of the dead to be interred. This &s;aid, he rode away: whom there accompanied the King him&s;elfe of <HI>Armenia,</HI> and all the people be&s;ides, calling him their bountifull benefactour, and a worthy good man. Thus they continu|ed untill they had conducted him out of their countrey. The <HI>Armenian</HI> King then, &s;ent unto him a greater armie, becau&s;e he had now peace at home. Thus departed <HI>Cyrus</HI> mightily enriched, not onely by the pre&s;ent trea&s;ure that he had received, but al&s;o for that by his good deportment he had made way for much more when&s;oever he &s;hould need. And &s;o for that time they pitched their tents in the confines.</P>
<P>The next morrow, he &s;ent the armie, and part of the money to <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> (who according to his promi&s;e was not farre off.) But him&s;elfe, with <HI>Tigranes</HI> and the Nobles of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> hunted where&s;oever he could meet with game, and merrily followed his &s;ports. Afterwards, being come into the <HI>Medes</HI> land, hee dealt money among his owne Centurions, &s;o much as was thought &s;ufficient for eve|ry one, that they al&s;o might have wherewith to honour and reward, tho&s;e that &s;erved under them, as many as they admired for their valour. For this recko|ning made he, that if each one performed his part prai&s;e-worthy, the whole bo|dy of the army likewi&s;e would prove right excellent. Furthermore, if him&s;elfe &s;aw any thing that might adorne the army, the &s;ame when he had once gotten it, hee would be&s;tow upon the be&s;t worthy: For, this hee &s;uppo&s;ed, that what good thing and beautifull ornament &s;oever the &s;ouldiours had, him&s;elfe with all the &s;ame was likewi&s;e adorned. And at the very &s;ame time, when he di&s;tribu|ted among them, &s;uch pre&s;ents as he had received, in a frequent a&s;&s;embly of his Centurions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, File leaders</NOTE> Caporalls, and all tho&s;e whom he be&s;t e&s;teemed, he made a &s;peech in this wi&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;eeme now my friends, to conceive a certaine joy, partly becau&s;e wee have gotten &s;ome wealth: and in part for that we have, wherewith to adorne tho&s;e we would, and whereby our &s;elves may be honoured againe, according as each one of us is worthy of advancement. But in any wi&s;e we mu&s;t ever call to remembrance, what manner of feats they bee, which have procured the&s;e good things unto us. For if yee con&s;ider well, yee &s;hall find, that yee have at|tained hereunto, by watching when time required, by travaile and paines ta|king,
<PB N="69" REF="44">by celerity and expedition, and finally by giving no ground unto the ene|mies. It behooveth you therefore hereafter to be hardy and valiant men, &s;etting this downe with your &s;elves, that great plea&s;ures and commodities both, can|not proceed but from obedience, con&s;tancie, labours and perils undertaken in time convenient. <HI>Cyrus</HI> now perceiving how fre&s;h and able in bodie his &s;oul|diers were to endure warre-travailes; how re&s;olute al&s;o and courageous in heart to de&s;pi&s;e their enemies: what skill be&s;ide each one had in every point belong|ing to their owne armes: Semblably, &s;eeing them all well di&s;po&s;ed and ready to obey their Rulers. In the&s;e re&s;pects, de&s;irous he was even now to performe &s;ome of tho&s;e exploits, which are u&s;ually enterpri&s;ed again&s;t enemies: knowing, that many times by delayes and putting of, Commaunders and Generals find &s;ome alteration even in brave projects and worthy de&s;&s;ignements. Furthermore, perceiving that many of his &s;ouldiers upon an ambitious humour, in their con|tentions where they &s;trived to &s;urpa&s;&s;e, began to envie one another; for this cau&s;e al&s;o de&s;irous he was with all &s;peed to lead them forth into the enemies countrey, as knowing right well, that common daungers kindle mutuall love and affection, betweene fellow &s;ouldiers; in which ca&s;e none of them will either envie others that are &s;et out in brave&s;t armour, or repine at them that be given to &s;eeke after glory and honour: but rather &s;uch per&s;ons both prai&s;e and al&s;o embrace their like, as reputing them to be joynt labourers with them in procu|ring the common good. Fir&s;t and formo&s;t therefore, hee harnoi&s;ed his armie and mar&s;halled it in as beautifull and excellent order as po&s;&s;ibly he could, then, called he togither the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Colonels, or leaders of ten thou&s;and.</NOTE> Myriarches, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Co~maunders of a thou&s;and.</NOTE> Chiliarches, the Centiniers, the Ca|porals likewi&s;e and pety Captaines of &s;maller bands (for the&s;e were free and not enrolled in the ordinary li&s;ts of &s;ouldiers: and yet when it was required that the Generall &s;hould be obeied or any charge given, no part of the armie for all that, was left ungoverned: but all matters el&s;e executed well enough by pety Captaines of 12. and 6. in a crew.) Now after the&s;e &s;erviceable men of note were come togither, <HI>Cyrus</HI> brought them into his Pavilion: and both &s;hewed unto them, what things were well and in good order, as al&s;o in&s;tructed them how the &s;everall forces and Companies of their Allies and Auxiliaries might be mo&s;t firme and &s;trong. And when he had &s;o wrought, that even they al&s;o had a longing de&s;ire to be employed in &s;ome Action, they cared not how &s;oone, thus he &s;aid unto them, Goe your waies now for this time unto your Compa|nies and in&s;truct every one your owne charge, as I have taught you, doing with|all your be&s;t, to kindle in them all, a fervent de&s;ire to undertake this expedition: that with a cheerefull heart yee may every one &s;et forward: and to morrow be|times &s;hew your &s;elves before <HI>Cyaxares</HI> at the Court gate. Then departed they, and did accordingly. The next morning by breake of day, tho&s;e men of Acti|on pre&s;t to performe their &s;ervice, were ready at the Palace. <HI>Cyrus</HI> therefore being entred in with them to <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> began to &s;peake in this manner.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> The &s;peech of <HI>Cyrus</HI> unto <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> about his expedition again&s;t the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am not ignorant deare Vnkle <HI>Cyaxares</HI> that the projects which I &s;hall now deliver, have beene long &s;ince con&s;idered upon and approved by you no le&s;&s;e than by us: but haply, aba&s;hed you are to utter the &s;ame, lea&s;t if your &s;elfe made mention of leading forth our armie, you might &s;eeme weary of finding and maintaining us as you doe. Seing therefore you keepe &s;ilence, I my &s;elfe both for you and us will propound the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e now in hand. For, we are all of this mind, &s;eeing we be &s;o well appointed, not to fight then, when as the ene|mie &s;hall invade your land, nor to wait for his comming, &s;itting &s;till as we doe in our friends country: but with all &s;peed to make a rode into the territories of our enemies. For now, &s;o long as we remaine in your land, much hurt we doe even again&s;t our wils unto many things of yours: but if we remoove into our enemies quarters, we &s;hall worke them the like di&s;plea&s;ure as willingly. More|over, now are we kept at your great charges: but if wee warre abroad without your marches, we &s;hall be victualled from out of our enemies countrey. Fur|thermore, were it &s;o that &s;ome greater perill might betide us there than here, then peradventure the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e were to bee cho&s;en. But now the ca&s;e is all one with them, whether wee waite here for them or &s;et forward to meet them there. In like manner wee al&s;o &s;hall be the &s;ame in fight, whether we receive them comming hither, or goe thither and give them battaile.</P>
<P>But in very truth the hearts of our &s;ouldiers we &s;hall finde more courageous, if we invade our enemies and &s;eeme not loth to affront them and looke them in the face. Semblably they will bee much more in feare of us, when they &s;hall heare that we &s;it not &s;till at home, as men &s;mitten with dread of them, but upon intelligence of their comming, are ready to encounter them on the way for to joyne battaile with all &s;peed, and not tarry untill our owne country be enda|maged, but preventing their attempts, wa&s;te their land fir&s;t: Certes, if we make them any whit more fearefull, or our &s;elves bolder, I &s;uppo&s;e it will bee to our great advantage. And by this meanes verily I make accompt, that our danger will be le&s;&s;e, and our enemies hazard much greater. Moreover, my fa|ther was alwaies wont to &s;ay, you al&s;o to confe&s;&s;e, and all others to accord, that fields are fought and battailes tried, rather by the re&s;olution of mens hearts, than the &s;trength of their bodies. Thus verily &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> unto whom <HI>Cyaxares</HI> made this an&s;were. But I would not have you <HI>Cyrus</HI> and the re&s;t of the Per&s;ians once to &s;u&s;pect, that I thinke much to mainteine you with victuals: Yet am I al&s;o of this minde, that in every re&s;pect it will be more expedient for us, even now to invade our enemies land. Since then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> we concurre in one opinion, let us joyntly tru&s;&s;e up bagge and baggage and &s;o di&s;lodge, and in ca&s;e our &s;acrifices unto the Gods a&s;&s;ent &s;oone unto our de&s;ires, with all &s;peed &s;et forward. Hereupon, after warning given to packe up and to put them&s;elves in readine&s;&s;e, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;acrificed to Iupiter King, fir&s;t: afterwards to the re&s;t of the Gods: praying withall, that they would vouch&s;afe to be propitious and favou|rable guides unto the Armie, and &s;hew them&s;elves gracious A&s;&s;i&s;tants, a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="71" REF="45">helpers and A&s;&s;ociates, yea and Coun&s;ellers for good, in all their Affaires. He invocated likewi&s;e the tutelar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Deities.</NOTE> powers, that inhabited and patronized the Me|dian Land. Now when he had fini&s;hed the &s;acrifices with lucky pre&s;ages, and that the armie was wholly a&s;&s;embled togither before him in the very marches, after tokens likewi&s;e of bird-flight, promi&s;ing happy &s;ucce&s;&s;e, he did &s;et foot within the enemies country. And no &s;ooner was hee entred the borders, but pre&s;ently hee there procured the gracious favour of Dame <HI>Tellus,</HI> with Liba|tours and liquid offerings. The Gods al&s;o and inhabitant Patrons of A&s;&s;yria he pacified with &s;olide ho&s;ts and &s;acrifices. Which complements done and en|ded, he &s;acrificed eft-&s;oones to Iupiter, the Protectour of his owne native &s;oile: and looke what other of the Gods &s;oever came into his knowledge, he negle|cted them not.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> went to encampe neere unto the A&s;&s;yrians, and pre|pared to give them battaile.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN all the&s;e things were accompli&s;hed in good &s;ort, the Infantery forthwith marched on and made no great journey but &s;oone pitched their tents. Howbeit, having put forth the Cavallery to make incur|&s;ions and to raunge abroad, they gate great pillage of all things. Then remoo|ved they, and being now furni&s;hed with all provi&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary, and forraging the country &s;till, they encamped and waited the enemies comming. Now, when noi&s;ed it was that their army was on foot and within ten daies journey, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aid, It is now high time &ocirc; <HI>Cyaxares</HI> to put on, and to meet with them: And let us give no cau&s;e to be thought, either of our enemies or our owne men, to &s;hrinke backe, and not to abide them, but rather &s;hew our &s;elves not unwil|ling to fight. When <HI>Cyaxares</HI> allowed well hereof, they marched on alwaies after, in battaile ray, going forward every day as farre as they thought good. As for their &s;uppers they never tooke them but by day-light: and in the night they made no fires within the campe. Howbeit, before the campe they burnt fire, to the end that by the light thereof, they might &s;ee if any came by night towards them, and yet not be &s;eene them&s;elves. Many times al&s;o, to deceive the enemie they did &s;et fires aburning behind the campe: whereby otherwhiles the enemies &s;pies fell into the hands of their formo&s;t e&s;cont-watch: For, by rea&s;on that the &s;aid fires were behind, they thought them&s;elves had beene yet farre from the campe. Now the A&s;&s;yrians with their Confederates and Al|lies, after that the Armies approched one the other, entrenched them&s;elves, A thing that the Barbarian Kings u&s;e to do even at this day. For, when they pitch their tents, an ea&s;ie matter it is for them to ca&s;t a trench about their campe, &s;o many hands have they to &s;et on worke. And, they know that a power of hor&s;e|men in the night is &s;oone di&s;ordered, and &s;o of little or no &s;ervice, e&s;pecially if it con&s;i&s;t of Barbarians: For, &s;uch u&s;e to have their hor&s;es tied by the feet at their mangers: And if any man &s;hould charge upon them, a labour it were by night to unloo&s;e the hor&s;es, a trouble to bridle them, a paine to &s;addle and trap them, much adoe al&s;o to bard them and doe on their harnois. Yea and when they are mounted on hor&s;ebacke, impo&s;&s;ible it is by any meanes to ride them
<PB N="72" REF="46">through the campe. For all the&s;e cau&s;es, they al&s;o like as all other Barbarians enclo&s;ed the&s;e within certeine fortifications, thought they might being thus within the &s;afegard of a fen&s;ed place, fight when they li&s;t them&s;elves, and not otherwi&s;e. Whiles they were thus bu&s;ied, they approched one the other, and being about a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">About three miles and three quarters Eng|li&s;h.</NOTE> Para&s;ang off, the A&s;&s;yrians encamped thus as I &s;aid, in a place entrenched round about, howbeit open and expo&s;ed to the eye. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> pit|ched his tents, as much out of &s;ight as po&s;&s;ibly he could, as having of purpo&s;e &s;ought out certeine villages, tofts and mounts, afront his campe, thinking that all his warlike equipage &s;odainly pre&s;ented, would be more terrible to his ad|ver&s;aries. And verily that night, after the Sentinels &s;et, as requi&s;ite it was, they betooke them&s;elves on either &s;ide to re&s;t. The day en&s;uing, the A&s;&s;yrian King and <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> with all the other Commaunders, kept their forces quiet within their Strength and re&s;ted &s;till: But <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;tood embattailed, ready to fight if the enemies came forward. But when it was for certeine knowne, that they would not that day i&s;&s;ue forth without their rampier, nor intended to fight, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> calling for <HI>Cyrus</HI> and all the gallants and men of Action, &s;pake unto them in this wi&s;e. My friends, I am of this minde, that thus well appoin|ted as we are, we ought to march unto the a&s;&s;ault of our enemies rampier, there|by to &s;hew that we for our parts are willing to fight. For, if by this bravado, they will not come forth again&s;t us, our men &s;hall be the better encouraged in giving the attempt: and our enemies upon the &s;ight of our boldne&s;&s;e and re&s;o|lution more daunted. This was the advi&s;e of <HI>Cyaxares.</HI> But <HI>Cyrus,</HI> For the love of God, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> let us not doe &s;o. For, if according to your minde wee &s;hew our &s;elves, and goe forward; our enemies will looke upon us now, with no feare at all, as we come upon them knowing them&s;elves, as they doe, to be in a place of &s;ecuritie &s;o as they can receive no hurt: and more than that, when as we retire without effect, they eft-&s;oones &s;eeing our forces far inferiour to theirs, will de&s;pi&s;e the &s;ame, and to morrow &s;ally forth with much more cou|rage and re&s;olution. Now for this pre&s;ent, knowing us as they doe, to be here, and yet not &s;eeing us, beleeve me verily, they &s;et not light by us, but mu&s;t they doe and marvaile what we meane, neither cea&s;&s;e they, I dare well &s;ay, to talke and di&s;cour&s;e of us. But when they &s;hall come forth fir&s;t, then will it behoove us both to appeare in &s;ight and at once to encounter and buckle with them, as having found them where heretofore we long de&s;ired. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had thus &s;aid, both <HI>Cyaxares</HI> and the re&s;t al&s;o agreed thereunto. Then therefore, having taken their &s;uppers, &s;et the watch and made fires accordingly before the &s;ame, they went to bed and &s;lept.</P>

<P>THE next day, early in the morning, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> with a Coronet upon his head, &s;acrificed: commaunding likewi&s;e the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Honourable Gentlemen, called Homo|timi.</NOTE> Peeres to weare Chap|lets and to be pre&s;ent at the &s;olemnitie of Sacrifices. When the&s;e De|votions were done and Sacrifice offred, he a&s;&s;embled them all togither, and un|to them made this &s;peech. The Gods, my deere friends, as both Divinors &s;ay and I my &s;elfe accord, fore-tell us that a battaile there will be; They al&s;o give
<PB N="73" REF="46">us victory, and in the Intrailes promi&s;e unto us &s;afety. Now, to admoni&s;h you; in what &s;ort ye &s;hould beare your &s;elves in this affaire, aba&s;hed I am. For, I know, that in the&s;e points, yee are as skilfull and expert as my &s;elfe, as who have &s;tu|died, meditated and heard, yea and continually do heare the&s;e things as well as I: in &s;o much as you by good right teach others the &s;ame. But if ye have not hi|therto under&s;tood and learned &s;o much, li&s;ten then to me. The&s;e here our A&s;&s;o|ciats, whom we have newly taken unto us, and endevour to make like unto our &s;elves, we mu&s;t put in minde, for what cau&s;e we have beene maintained by <HI>Cy|axares?</HI> what exerci&s;es wee have beene trained in, and to what purpo&s;e wee have called them hither? as al&s;o in what regard they have given it out, that right willingly they will enter into the Action with us, and try it out by dint of &s;word. This al&s;o yee ought to recall into their remembrance, that this is the very day, which will declare what rewards each one is worthy off. For, &s;uch things as men be late ere they learne, no mervaile it is, if &s;ome of them have need of one al&s;o to &s;ugge&s;t and prompt unto them. Yea, a ble&s;&s;ed turne it were, if men might become valiant, even by the in&s;tinct and provocation of o|thers. And verily in &s;o doing, yee &s;hall give good proofe of your &s;elves withall. For, he that is able in &s;uch a matter as this, to better others and make them more valiant, may without que&s;tion be privy to him&s;elfe, that he hath atteined to the perfection of valour. Whereas, he who being able to enforme him&s;elfe in the&s;e things, re&s;teth therein, &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;ufficient; and proceedeth no far|ther, is by good rea&s;on to hold him&s;elfe but halfe perfect. And for this cau&s;e, I deliver not thus much to them, but charge you to declare the &s;ame, that they may endevour to give you content. For, yee al&s;o are next conver&s;ant with them, every one in his owne particular. And this, quoth he, would I have you to know: that &s;o long as ye &s;hall be &s;eene of them full of valour and re&s;olution, yee &s;hall become ma&s;ters and teachers, both to them and al&s;o to many more, not in word, but in deed, for to be likewi&s;e valiant and courageous. At the la&s;t, he knit up his &s;peech with bidding them to goe to dinner wearing guirlands on their heads: and after the complements of &s;acred libations performed, to re|paire every man to their owne companies dight as they were with the &s;ame guirlands. When the&s;e were departed, he called unto him the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"><HI>quibus oppon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ntur</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. bringers up.</NOTE> Leaders in the Reer, unto whom he u&s;ed the&s;e words. My good friends, that are Per&s;ians, raunged yee al&s;o be in the number of the Peeres as &s;elected Gentlemen, reputed as in other re&s;pects to parallel the very be&s;t, &s;o for your age to excell them in wi&s;edome. And verily, for this cau&s;e are yee in place no le&s;&s;e honourable than that of the formo&s;t Commaunders in the vaward. For, being in the rereward, by ob&s;erving tho&s;e that be hardy, and by encouraging them, yee may &s;oone make them to be more valiant, and againe, if any one be faint-hearted, by no|ting likewi&s;e and marking him, yee will not cocker nor &s;uffer &s;uch a one to con|tinue &s;o &s;till. Moreover, expedient it is for you, if for any other who&s;oever, to gaine victory, as well in regard of your age as the ma&s;&s;ine&s;&s;e and weight of your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, armour.</NOTE> habite. If they then, that are before in the vaward call upon you and commaund to follow, I would have you to obey them. And to the end that yee al&s;o may not be inferiour to them in this behalfe, exhort them againe to lead and put forward with &s;peed again&s;t the enemy. And now, quoth he, goe yee al&s;o to your dinners, and having dined, togither with the re&s;t in your guir|lands, repaire unto your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, colours.</NOTE> companies.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> How the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> i&s;&s;ued out of his campe to fight a field, and made a &s;peech unto his &s;oldiours. How <HI>Cyrus</HI> and they afterwards joyned battaile, wherein the <HI>A&s;&s;y|rians</HI> were di&s;comfited.</HEAD>
<P>THus were the &s;ouldiers of <HI>Cyrus</HI> occupied; by which time the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> having dined already, &s;allied boldly out of their campe, made a bra|vado, and with re&s;olute hearts &s;tood &s;trongly appointed in battaile ray. The King him&s;elfe in per&s;on, mounted in his chariot did put them in order, and withall in this manner exhorted them. Now is the time &ocirc; yee <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> when yee mu&s;t &s;hew your valour: For, now are yee to fight for your lives, for the &s;oyle wherein yee were borne, for the hou&s;es in which yee were fo&s;tered, for your wives and children, and for all the goods that yee have. If yee atchieve the victorie, Lords yee &s;hall be of all this as heretofore: but if ye be vanqui&s;hed, wote well that yee mu&s;t forgoe all, and leave the &s;ame to your enemies. Stand to it therefore and fight manfully, as becommeth tho&s;e that affectionately do love victorie. For, meere folly it were, that &s;uch as de&s;ire victory &s;hould flie away and turne unto the view of their enemies the blind backe parts, &s;uch as be neither armed nor furni&s;hed with hands. And, a foole he is, who de&s;irous to live, goes about to run away, as being a&s;&s;ured that the winners are they who &s;hall be &s;afe, where as they that flie, &s;hall &s;ooner die than tho&s;e that tarry by it. A foole al&s;o he is and no better who coveting wealth, &s;uffreth him&s;elfe to be overcome. For, who knoweth not that the Conquerours &s;ave their owne goods, and be|&s;ides the &s;ame, gaine al&s;o the goods of their enemies conquered? Whereas they that be &s;ubdued, &s;hall at once lo&s;e both them&s;elves, and all that they have. Whiles the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King was thus bu&s;ied, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;ent &s;ome unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who &s;aid, That now the opportunity of time &s;erved to lead forward and to &s;et upon the enemie. For, how ever few of them are i&s;&s;ued forth without the trench, by that time quoth he that we be come unto them, they will be very many. Let us not &s;tay therefore and wait untill they be more in number than we: but &s;et forward whiles we thinke we may ea&s;ily overmatch them. <HI>Cyrus</HI> an&s;wered, I would have you to under&s;tand &ocirc; <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> that unle&s;&s;e more than the halfe part of them be vanqui&s;hed, they will give out, that we for feare of their multitude did charge but a few of them, and therefore they will not take them&s;elves to be defaited: &s;o that you mu&s;t then fight a &s;econd field, wherein peradventure they will be better provided and u&s;e more policy than now they doe offring them&s;elves to us: &s;o, as that we may at our owne choi&s;e, fight with what number &s;oever we will. The me&s;&s;engers when they heard this departed. Meane while, <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> came, and certaine other of the Peeres and Gentlemen, bringing with them tho&s;e that had runne from the enemies part un|to them: Of whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> enquired, as meet it was, what his enemies were a do|ing? Who an&s;wered, That they were already come forth of the campe all ar|med, That the King him&s;elfe being without, was &s;etting them in array, and en|couraging them ever as they i&s;&s;ued forth with many words and tho&s;e very for|cible, as they affirmed, who heard him &s;peake. Hereat <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> What and
<PB N="75" REF="47">if quoth hee you al&s;o &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> would draw your &s;ouldiers togither while you have time and exhort them, &s;hould not you likewi&s;e make them more hardie? Tu&s;h, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> let the per&s;wa&s;ive orations of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King my good <HI>Chry|&s;antas,</HI> never trouble you: For, no exhortation wil be &s;o effectual, as to make men the very &s;ame day that they heare it, of cowards to be valiant: nor Archers, un|le&s;&s;e they had beforehand beene exerci&s;ed in that feat: nor Darters, ne yet hor&s;|men: nay it will not worke thus much, as to cau&s;e them to be able in body, for to endure paines taking, except they were trained before therein. But yet re|plyed <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> it would &s;uffice, if by your exhortation you could but make their hearts more courageous. Why! quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> is one dayes work, or one oration able, not onely to repleni&s;h the hearts of the hearers with mode&s;t &s;hame, or reclaime them from things di&s;hone&s;t and unbe&s;eeming, but al&s;o to excite and &s;tirre them up, for the love of prai&s;e and glory to determine for to undergoe all labour, and adventure all perils, and to grow unto this &s;tedfa&s;t re&s;olution, that better it is for men to fight valiantly and &s;o to die, than to run away and &s;ave their lives? Al&s;o, to the imprinting, quoth he, of &s;uch thoughts in mens minds, and to retaine the &s;ame there firmely fixed, is it not behovefull, That fir&s;t there were &s;uch po&s;itive lawes, by vertue whereof, for valiant men there &s;hould be provided a wor&s;hipfull and free life, but upon cowards might be impo&s;ed a ba&s;e, grievous and unplea&s;ant condition? Then, there ought to be M^r^s. I &s;uppo&s;e, and Governors appointed be&s;ide, who may rightly in&s;truct &amp; ac|cu&s;tome them to perform the &s;ame &s;o long, untill this opinion be &s;urely &s;ettled, namely to repute in very deed valiant and noble men happie&s;t, and to thinke co|wards and ob&s;cure per&s;ons of all others mo&s;t mi&s;erable. For, in this wi&s;e ought they to be affected, who will &s;hew, that di&s;cipline availeth more than the feare that ari&s;eth from the enemies. But, if a man, when &s;ouldiours are going armed into the field (what time many of them forgoe and forget even their old le&s;&s;ons and principles) were able at the in&s;tant, with a &s;ubitary &s;peech to make them brave and worthy warriours, certes, it were the ea&s;ie&s;t matter in the world, both to learne and al&s;o to teach the mo&s;t excellent vertue of all others that belongeth to a man. And verily, for mine owne part, I would not beleeve, That even the&s;e here whom we have now with us, and have trained up and exerci&s;ed, will con|&s;tantly per&s;evere and abide to the end, but that I &s;ee you pre&s;ent in place, both willing to give them good example how they ought to carry them&s;elves, and able al&s;o to &s;ugge&s;t unto them, that which haply they have forgotten. But as for tho&s;e quoth he, my <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> who are altogither raw and untrained in vertue and prowe&s;&s;e, I would much marvaile if an oration with a goodly grace pronounced, could helpe them more to attaine unto valiantne&s;&s;e, than a &s;ong &s;weetly chaunted, edifie tho&s;e in the knowledge of mu&s;icke, that are alto|gither ignorant of that &s;cience. In this manner rea&s;oned and di&s;cour&s;ed they. By which time <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;ent eft&s;oones unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> charging him in plaine termes that he did ami&s;&s;e, to delay the time &s;o long, and not with all expedi|tion march again&s;t the enemies. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> returned this an&s;wer unto his me&s;|&s;engers: Let <HI>Cyaxares</HI> quoth he under&s;tand, That they are not come forth as many of them as &s;hould: And thus much tell him from me in the hearing of all. Neverthele&s;&s;e, becau&s;e it is his mind, I will anon &s;et forward. Ha|ving thus &s;aid, and made his orai&s;ons unto the Gods, he brought forth his for|ces. Now when he began to march &s;till fa&s;ter and fa&s;ter than ordinarie, he led
<PB N="76" REF="48">the way him&s;elfe and his &s;ouldiers followed not onely with an orderly pace in good array, as having through long exerci&s;e learned to keep order: but, al&s;o courageou&s;ly and with re&s;olution: For that, in a kind of emulation, they &s;trove one to excell another, and had bodies withall well enured and hardned to tra|vaile: as al&s;o, for that all tho&s;e that went formo&s;t were no other than their very Captaines and Commaunders: yea and cheerefully be&s;ide, in regard of their skill and cunning: For, they knew and had learned long agoe, that it was the &s;a|fe&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t way, all at once directly to charge the enemies, e&s;pecially if they be Archers, darters and hor&s;emen. Whiles therefore they were yet without the daunger of &s;hot, <HI>Cyrus</HI> gave this Motto for the &s;ignal of Battaile. <HI>IVPITER AIDER And LEADER,</HI> which having pa&s;&s;ed from one to another through the ho&s;t and being returned again unto him, he began to &s;ing a &s;olemn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. or the Battaile.</NOTE> Hymne unto <HI>CASTOR</HI> and <HI>PoLLVX:</HI> and all his &s;ouldiours with a devour mind and loud voice chaunted the &s;ame with him: For in &s;uch a ca&s;e, as many as be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, &s;uper&s;ti|tious. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> re|ligiou&s;ly given, &s;tand le&s;&s;e in feare of men. The &s;aid &s;ong being ended, The Peeres above-&s;aid march on, bravely togither, with a light&s;ome countenance (as being well trained and taught) beholding one another, calling by name to their &s;idemen, and next followers, iterating full often the&s;e words. Now to it good friends. Goe to it now right valiant Knights: mightily encouraging each one his fellow to follow. Which they that came behind hearing, exhor|ted &s;emblably the former to lead and goe before boldly. Thus the whole ar|mie without, was repleni&s;hed with forward alacrity, de&s;irous of glory and re|nowne, full of &s;trength, of confident boldne&s;&s;e, of encouragement and exhor|tation, of &s;tayed temperance and obedience, which I take to be the mo&s;t ter|rible objects that can be pre&s;ented to enemies. But, of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> &s;uch as were ready to fight before the rampiers and in defence of their campe, when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> army once approached neere unto them, mounted their chariots, and retired them&s;elves to their fellowes where they were thicke&s;t embattailed. As for their Archers, Darters and Slingers, they di&s;charged from them their &s;hot farre &s;ooner, and before they could po&s;&s;ibly reach unto their enemies. When the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> now, by prea&s;&s;ing forward, were come within the daunger of &s;hot, <HI>Cyrus</HI> with a lowd voice cryed out. Now mo&s;t brave and redou|ted Knights, Step &s;ome one quickly before, and &s;hew proufe of his valour, and therewith encourage he the re&s;t. The&s;e words uttered they al&s;o againe to the other. By occa&s;ion whereof, &s;ome upon a brave and courageous &s;pi|rit, upon an ardent de&s;ire al&s;o and love to fight, began to make &s;peed, whom the whole maine battaile followed with a running pace. <HI>Cyrus</HI> likewi&s;e him|&s;elfe, forgetting to keepe his ordinary march, ranne before crying out, Who followes, who? where is the valiant &s;oldier that will fell and lay along the fir&s;t man? Which others hearing, &s;econded him and held on the &s;ame note. Thus throughout the whole armie, as he began, the voice went, who will follow? who will play the douty man! Well, in this manner gave the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> the fir&s;t on&s;et and fiercely a&s;&s;ailed the enemies. But they not able to abide the &s;hocke and the open field, reculed, and turned their backs, flying amaine unto their trench and rampier. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> pur&s;uing them unto the very gates, whiles they thronged and thru&s;t one another to get in, &s;lew many of them. And looke who fell into the trenches, they leaped downe upon them and killed them outright both hor&s;e and man. For, &s;ome of the Chariots were forced
<PB N="77" REF="48" MS="y">in this their rout to fall downe into the ditches. Which when the <HI>Medes</HI> hor&s;emen &s;aw, they rode with full carrier again&s;t the enemies hor&s;emen: who gave way to decline their violence. Whereupon began a great chace both of hor&s;e and men, together with much &s;laughter as well of the one as of the o|ther. Tho&s;e <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> which within the Munition &s;tood upon the top of the rampier, had neither mind nor might, to &s;hoot and dart at tho&s;e, who made &s;uch carnage and havocke: &s;o terrible was the &s;pectacle thereof and &s;o &s;mit|ten were they with feare. Perceiving then &s;oone after, that certaine <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had broken through the gates and entries of their fortifications, they turned backe and fled from the &s;aid toppe of the rampier. The wives, as well of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> as of their auxiliary A&s;&s;ociats, &s;eeing this rout within the campe, skriked out and ran up and downe all amazed: Some of them being mothers of children, others but younglings, tearing their &s;ide garments, and &s;cratch|ing them&s;elves with their owne nailes, lamentably be&s;eeching all tho&s;e whom they met, not to flye and for&s;ake them, but to defend their children and them|&s;elves. And herewith the KK. them&s;elves with their tru&s;tie&s;t guard about them, &s;tood at the very gates, and climbing up to the top of the rampiers, partly in proper per&s;on fought, and in part exhorted others to doe the &s;ame. <HI>Cyrus</HI> after he under&s;tood what was done, fearing lea&s;t by making an irruption and forcible entry, his men &s;o few in number might be hurt of &s;o many, &s;oun|ded the retrait, commaunding them to retire, out of the arrow &s;hot, and to obey. Then, and there, a man might have &s;eene the noble Peeres, how excellently they had beene brought up in martiall di&s;cipline: For, &s;treightwaies them|&s;elves obeied, and gave charge to the re&s;t, for to doe the like as quickely: and no &s;ooner were they without the danger of &s;hot, but they &s;tood raun|ged in their places, more orderly than in any daunce or quire of Mu&s;icians, whiles every man knew perfitly where hee &s;hould be.</P>

<P>_CYRVS having &s;taied there long enough with his armie and made open &s;hew, that ready they were to fight if any would i&s;&s;ue forth, &s;eeing none to come abroad, withdrew his power &s;o farre as he thought good and there encam|ped; Now when he had &s;et his Corps du guard, and &s;ent out his e&s;pialls before, him&s;elfe having a&s;&s;embled his &s;ol|diers, in this manner &s;pake unto them. My friends, yee that are Per&s;ians, Fir&s;t, the Gods above I laud and prai&s;e to my full power, like as I &s;uppo&s;e yee all doe: For, atchieved we have this day both victorie and &s;afetie. In regard whereof bound we are to retribute gifts unto their Maje&s;ties, in to|ken of thankes, even out of all that ever we have. And as for you, I cannot choo&s;e but commend you every one: For, looke what &s;ervice there is exploi|ted, the &s;ame hath beene performed to the honour of you all. But as concer|ning due recompen&s;e in particular, when I am certified by tho&s;e, of whom meet it is I &s;hould enquire, of what de&s;ert every one is, I &s;hall endevour both in word and deed to conferre rewards upon each one re&s;pectively. And verily, as tou|ching this Centurion here <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> who was next unto mee, I need not to learne of others, as knowing my &s;elfe very well how hee hath borne him|&s;elfe: For, as in every point el&s;e hee hath done his devoyr, like as of you all I &s;uppo&s;e no le&s;&s;e: &s;o when I had cau&s;ed the retreat to bee &s;ounded and called unto him by name, albeit hee had his &s;word up ready to &s;mite his enemie, hee pre&s;ently obeyed, and leaving that undone which hee went about, did as he was commanded: For, not onely retired he in per&s;on, but readily charged the re&s;t to doe the &s;ame: in &s;o much as he brought his owne company without daunger of the voley, ere our enemies wi&s;t that we gave ground at all, even before they could draw their bowes, or launce their javelins again&s;t us: and &s;o he is both &s;afe him&s;elfe, and by his obedience hath &s;aved his owne men al&s;o. As for others, quoth he, I &s;ee &s;ome in deed wounded, of whom when I
<PB N="79" REF="49">have better con&s;idred what time they were hurt, I &s;hall then deliver my doome. But <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> being &s;o brave a man of action, &s;o wi&s;e withall, and &s;ufficient as well to rule as to be ruled; him, I &s;ay, at this pre&s;ent I ordeine a Colonel over a thou&s;and. And when&s;oever God &s;hall give me a good hand againe, I will not then be forgerfull of him. And I would have you all, quoth he, to remem|ber thus much and make u&s;e of this journey. For, what&s;oever erewhile ye have &s;eene in this fight, never cea&s;&s;e to thinke upon, that ye may alwaies judge with|in your &s;elves, whether it is running away, or pree&s;&s;e rather, that &s;aveth your lives? Al&s;o, whether they that fight willingly, be &s;ooner freed from warre, or tho&s;e who are unwilling? Likewi&s;e, what plea&s;ure it is that victory bringeth. For none of the&s;e points may ye be&s;t determine, as having made proofe and &s;eene the experience, con&s;idering the &s;ervice is &s;o lately performed. And verily by continuall meditation hereof, yee &s;hall prove the better. Now therefore, as religious, valiant, and temperate men, take your &s;uppers. Offer &s;acred libations to the Gods, beginning with a triumphant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> &s;ong, and withall have an eye and due regard to that which is commaunded. Thus &s;aid, he got up to hor&s;ebacke, and rode away untill he was come to <HI>Cyaxares:</HI> Where, after rejoycing with him as requi&s;ite it was, upon mutuall congratulation for their common victory: when he had &s;eene how things went there and asked of him what need he had of his &s;ervice, he rode backe from thence to his own armie. As for <HI>Cyrus</HI> and his &s;ouldiers, after they had &s;upped and appointed a &s;ufficient watch, they betooke them&s;elves to re&s;t.</P>
<P>But the A&s;&s;yrians, who&s;e Soveraine Commaunder was &s;laine and with him the very flowre and be&s;t of his &s;ouldiers, were all in great heavine&s;&s;e yea and many of them by night &s;lipt away and fled out of the Camp. Which when <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> and the re&s;t of their Allies perceived, they &s;orrowed all very much (for every thing was dolorous) but this troubled them mo&s;t in generall, that throughout the armie, all the prime company of tho&s;e that &s;hould have beene their Leaders were out of heart, void of coun&s;ell and at their wits end. Where|upon in the night &s;ea&s;on they abandoned their tents and departed. When day appeared and di&s;covered how naked of fighting men their Camp was: <HI>Cyrus</HI> pre&s;ently advanced thither fir&s;t with the Per&s;ians. Now, the enemies had left behind them, many Sheepe, many Kine and Oxen, and be&s;ides many waggons full of much trea&s;ure and goods. Then repaired thither all the Medes likewi&s;e, who were with <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> where they dined. Dinner being done, <HI>Cyrus</HI> called unto him his owne Centiniers, and unto them made this Oration. My &s;ouldiers, what benefits and how great, pre&s;ented here unto us by the goodne&s;&s;e of God &s;eeme we to let &s;lip out of our hands? For now, your owne &s;elves &s;ee, that the enemies for feare of us be fled. And if they, being fortified &s;trongly within their hold have quit the &s;ame, and are runne away, how may any man imagine, that they will &s;tand to it, if they &s;ee us on even ground in the plaine field? Al&s;o, they that dur&s;t not hold out when they had no experience of our valour; how &s;hall they be able now to abide us, defaited as they are already and having &s;uf|fred &s;o many di&s;plea&s;ures at our hands? And how &s;hall their greate&s;t cowards be willing to fight with us, who&s;e mo&s;t valiant men lye &s;laine upon the ground before us? Hereat, &s;aid one of the Company, why then doe we not with all &s;peed pur&s;ue them, &s;eeing &s;o great availes comming toward us &s;o evidently? Becau&s;e, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> we want good hor&s;es: whereas the very be&s;t of our
<PB N="80" REF="50">enemies, and &s;uch, as mo&s;t fit it were now, either to kill or to take pri&s;oners, hie them homeward apace well mounted on good cour&s;ers? And tho&s;e verily by Gods helpe, able were we to put to flight, but in following the chace, &s;hall never overtake. Why then, &s;ay they, goe you not to <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> and impart &s;o much unto him? Say you &s;o? quoth he, Then follow mee all, that he may know, yee are generally of this minde. So they all both followed <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and al&s;o declared what they thought meet as touching the matter they required. <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> partly for that they made the motion fir&s;t, &s;omewhat envied them: and partly becau&s;e he thought he &s;hould doe well for him&s;elfe, if he did not enter into daunger a &s;econd time (for &s;urely he gave him&s;elfe to joy and mirth, and &s;aw many of the Medes doe the &s;ame) an&s;wered in this manner.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The opinion of <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> to divert <HI>Cyrus</HI> from following the traine of his victorie.</HEAD>
<P>I Know nephew <HI>Cyrus</HI> both by report, and al&s;o by that which I have &s;eene my &s;elfe, that yee Per&s;ians of all other men &s;tudy mo&s;t, not to &s;et your minds upon any plea&s;ure un&s;atiably. But verily, for mine own part, I thinke it much more behoovefull, in the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to be continent and hold a meane. And what is it, that pre&s;enteth greater contentment to men, than good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, which at this time is falne unto us? If we therefore being now in hap|py ca&s;e, can &s;oberly and wi&s;ely keepe the &s;ame, we may perhaps live unto our old age in felicitie without all daunger. But if wee are never &s;atisfied there|with, pur&s;uing &s;till one good fortune in the necke of another: take heed, lea&s;t that befall unto us, which, they &s;ay, many navigatours have found at &s;ea; who meeting &s;ometime with a good gale of wind and fortunate voyage, would ne|ver make an end of &s;ayling, untill they were ca&s;t away and &s;o peri&s;hed. Sem|blably, many men, (by report) having obteined one victory, by coveting to winne another, have lo&s;t the former: For, truly if our enemies who are fled, were fewer in number than we, it might peradventure be &s;afe for us to pur&s;ue them being &s;o few. But now, con&s;ider with how &s;mall a troup of them wee all fought, when we gained the upper hand? The re&s;t were not at the battaile nor &s;trucke one &s;troke: whom if we force not to draw &s;word, they not knowing us nor them&s;elves, for want of skill and for cowardi&s;e will be glad to e&s;cape and be gone: But if they perceive once, that they &s;hall be in as great jeopardie by running away, as by tarrying &s;till, and have no hope of &s;afety but in their &s;words point, beware we urge them not even again&s;t their owne wils and pur|po&s;e, to beare them&s;elves like valiant men. For, this you mu&s;t know, that you are not &s;o de&s;irous to take their wives and children pri&s;oners as they be to &s;ave them. Con&s;ider al&s;o, that wild &s;wine when they are e&s;pied by the hunter run away, (many though they be in number) with their young pigs: but if a man hunt or chace any of their young ones, they will flye no longer, no though there be but one of them and no more, but a&s;&s;aile him that goeth about to catch the &s;ame. And verily, the enemies at this time beeing enclo&s;ed within their &s;trength, give us leave to skirmi&s;h with as many of them as we thought good our &s;elves: but in ca&s;e wee joyne battaile with them in the broad and open
<PB N="81" REF="50" MS="y">plaine, when they &s;hall learne, divided apart as erewhile, &s;ome to confront us, others to flanke us on the one &s;ide and the other, and &s;ome againe to &s;et upon us behind in the tayle: See then whether every one of us have not need both of many eyes, and al&s;o of as many hands? Furthermore, I would not wi&s;h, quoth he, for my part, &s;eeing as I doe the Medes &s;olacing them&s;elves in myrth, to withdraw them from their delights, and force them to hazard their lives in a doubtfull piece of &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> obtained of <HI>Cyaxares</HI> part of the <HI>Medes</HI> forces: and with them and the <HI>Hyrcanians</HI> togither that yeelded unto him, pur&s;ued the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> in their flight.</HEAD>
<P>VPon this &s;peech <HI>Cyrus</HI> briefly replied: You &s;halt not need, [good Vn|kle] to compell any man: onely let me have them who will follow me as voluntaries, and peradventure we &s;hall returne, bringing unto you and to every one of the&s;e your friends, that which will give you all good con|tentment. Follow we will not in chace the maine multitude of our enemies (for how po&s;&s;ibly &s;hould we encompa&s;&s;e and take them?) but if we may light upon any piece of their armie di&s;membred from the re&s;t, or upon a skirt and remnant thereof, we &s;hall fetch it in and bring the &s;ame unto you. Moreover, thinke this, quoth he, that we at your reque&s;t are come a great journey, and all to gratifie and doe you plea&s;ure; You therefore in all equity are to requite us in the like: that we al&s;o may in &s;ome &s;ort make up our owne mouthes, and &s;o re|turne home with good pillage; and not depend all of us, upon your pay and trea&s;ure. Then &s;aid <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> If any one will of his owne accord beare you company, I would acknowledge my &s;elfe beholden al&s;o vnto you. Send there|fore, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> with me one of the&s;e here who de&s;erveth to be tru&s;ted mo&s;t, that he may declare unto the <HI>Medes</HI> from you, what you commaund. Goe to, &s;aid <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> take of all the&s;e any one, whom you will chu&s;e. Now, it hapned that the <HI>Median</HI> Gentleman was there pre&s;ent, who in times pa&s;t had claimed kinred of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and gotten &s;o many ki&s;&s;es of him. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> forthwith, This man here, quoth he, without more adoe &s;hall &s;erve my turne. Content &s;aid <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> let him wait upon you: and withall, he charged the party, to deliver thus much in his name, That who&s;oever would, might goe with <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Thus <HI>Cyrus</HI> taking the man with him, went out: and when he was gone forth, he pre|&s;ently &s;aid unto him: Now verily &s;hall you make knowne whether you &s;pake truth or no, when you &s;aid you tooke much plea&s;ure in beholding me. Say you &s;o? quoth the <HI>Median,</HI> Then will I never for&s;ake you. And are you willing &s;aid <HI>Cyrus</HI> to impart as much to others likewi&s;e? Then the man bound it with an oath and &s;aid yea by <HI>Iupiter</HI> that I will: and bring it &s;o about in the end, that even you &s;hall be as willing to looke upon me al&s;o. Then being thus &s;ent from <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> as he declared otherwi&s;e right cheerefully this errand to the <HI>Medes,</HI> &s;o he added this moreover, that he would never depart from &s;o noble, &s;o excel|lent, &s;o goodly a per&s;on, and that which pa&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t, de&s;cended from the race of the Gods.</P>
<P>Whiles <HI>Cyrus</HI> was bu&s;ie about the&s;e affaires, there arrived, as it were by the
<PB N="82" REF="51">providence of God, certaine Emba&s;&s;adors from the <HI>Hyrcanians.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Hyrca|nians</HI> border upon the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians.</HI> A nation verily nothing populous (which is the rea&s;on that &s;ubject they were unto the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI>) howbeit, reputed then, (as they are no le&s;&s;e at this day,) good hor&s;emen. In which regard al&s;o the <HI>A&s;sy|rians</HI> employed them, as the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> did the <HI>Scyrites,</HI> making no &s;pare of them, but putting them to all paines taking and adventures. And at this very time, they had charged them to keepe the Reare (and in number they were a|bout a thou&s;and hor&s;e) to the end that if any damage hapned behind, they fir&s;t, &s;hould undergoe it before them&s;elves. The&s;e Hyrcanians, becau&s;e they were to march hinmo&s;t, had their waggons al&s;o and their families behind all the re&s;t. For, the nations of A&s;ia, the mo&s;t part, in all their expeditions, u&s;e to goe to warre with their whole hou&s;holds. And in this manner &s;erved the Hyr|canians at that time. Who now con&s;idering well with them&s;elves, what hard and &s;ervile warfare they were put to under the A&s;&s;yrians: al&s;o that now their Soveraine Lord being &s;laine, they were all foyled and di&s;comfited, their whole armie in great feare, their A&s;&s;ociats out of heart, ready to faint and for&s;ake them; ca&s;ting, I &s;ay, the&s;e things in their minds, they thought they had a fit time and opportunitie offred to revolt, if togither with them <HI>Cyrus</HI> and his for|ces would make head afre&s;h and &s;et upon them. Hereupon they di&s;patched their me&s;&s;engers unto <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For, now by rea&s;on of this battaile, his name was up and his fame much encrea&s;ed. The&s;e that were &s;ent, related unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> what ju&s;t cau&s;e they had to hate the A&s;&s;yrians: if therefore at this time he were di&s;|po&s;ed, to make an inva&s;ion they would become both A&s;&s;ociates, and leade the vaward al&s;o in this journey. Withall, they recounted unto him, in what &s;tate the enemies &s;tood, the rather to incite him thereby to take this expedition in hand. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> que&s;tioned with them in this &s;ort: Thinke yee, quoth he, that we &s;hall be able yet to overtake them, before they put them&s;elves into their &s;trong holds? For we take this for a great infortunitie of ours, that they have &s;o &s;ecretly in the night e&s;caped from us. This &s;pake he becau&s;e he would have them to conceive an excellent opinion of him. Who an&s;wered, That ear|ly the next morning they might reach them, if they made &s;peed and went light|ly appointed. For, by rea&s;on, &s;ay they, of their great multitude, and heavy carriages, they march but &s;lowly: and be&s;ides, for that they &s;ate up and watched all night before, they had now rid but &s;mall ground forward, and pitched their tents betimes. Then replyed <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Can ye put in any pledge for our a&s;&s;urance, that yee &s;peake the truth? Wee will, &s;ay they, forthwith ride away, and even this night bring ho&s;tages with us for your better &s;ecuritie. Onely doe you a&s;&s;ure us in the name of God, and give us your right hand, that we may make report to others, what wee have received from you. Then hee faithfully promi&s;ed them, that if they performed <HI>bona fide,</HI> what they had &s;aid, he would u&s;e them as his tru&s;ty and a&s;&s;ured friends: neither would he ranke them inferiour in place either to the Per&s;ians or to the Medes. And even at this very day, a man &s;hall &s;ee the Hyrcanians put in tru&s;t and bearing office of &s;tate, as well as Per&s;ians or Medes, &s;uch as are thought of be&s;t worth. After they had &s;upped, <HI>Cyrus</HI> led forth his armie before day light was gone, and commaunded tho&s;e Hyrcanians to give attendance there and to march onward togither with him. As for the Per&s;ians, they all in generall, as requi&s;ite it was, &s;peedily came forth, and <HI>Ti|granes</HI> al&s;o with his owne Regiment. Of the Medes, &s;ome entred this journey,
<PB N="83" REF="51">for that having beene children when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was a child, were now become his friends: others, becau&s;e they had beene his companions in hunting, and were much delighted in his good behaviour: &s;ome againe in token of thankfulne&s;&s;e unto him becau&s;e he &s;eemed to have delivered them out of great feare: others al&s;o upon good hopes, that &s;eeing hee bare him&s;elfe &s;o valiantly, hee would prove afterwards a fortunate, and mightie Prince. There were be&s;ides divers of them willing now to doe him &s;ome reciprocall plea&s;ure and &s;ervice for the good turnes which hee had procured unto any whiles hee was brought up a|mong the Medes. And verily, (as he was of a kinde and courteous nature), he had procured for a number of them at his Grand&s;ires hands many favours. La&s;t of all, a great &s;ort of them, after they had &s;eene the Hyrcanians and heard a rumour &s;pred abroad, that they would be their Leaders to bring them unto great wealth, went forth for to get &s;omewhat. Thus the Medes in manner all, followed him: unle&s;&s;e they were &s;uch as hapned to be of the Dome&s;ticall traine of <HI>Cyaxares:</HI> For, the&s;e onely remained, togither with tho&s;e that were their va&s;&s;als and followers. As for all the re&s;t, full gladly and cheerefully, they did put them&s;elves forward in this journey, not I &s;ay as men con&s;treined, but as meere voluntaries, and who to gratifie him, of their owne accord went forth. When they were now abroad upon the way, fir&s;t hee commeth out unto the Medes, whom he prai&s;ed: and prayed withall, <HI>Imprimis,</HI> that the Gods would vouch&s;afe to be propitious guides both to them and his. <HI>Item,</HI> To graunt him &s;uch favour as to bee able to render unto them condigne recompen&s;e for this their affectionate love unto him. In conclu&s;ion, hee gave order, that the foot|men &s;hould lead the march: and then he commaunded the hor&s;emen to fol|low. Moreover, if in any place they re&s;ted or &s;tayed in their journey, he char|ged that &s;ome &s;hould ride unto him, to know from time to time what was ex|pedient to be done. After this, he willed the &s;aid Hyrcanians to lead formo&s;t. Who asked him in this manner, Why? Sir, tarry not you and expect untill wee bring our ho&s;tages: that you al&s;o, having taken pledges of us for the bet|ter &s;ecuritie of our troth, may then &s;et forward? And he, by report, made this an&s;were. Even, for that I con&s;ider, we doe all carry the a&s;&s;urance of our faith, no otherwi&s;e than in our hands and hearts. For, at this point and thus provi|ded &s;eeme wee to be, that if yee be true of your word unto us, we have &s;uffici|ent power and meanes to doe you good: but if yee be fal&s;e and deceive us, we take our &s;elves to be in that &s;tate, as we need not be in &s;ubjection unto you, but yee rather (if the Gods will) &s;hall be thrall unto us and at our devotion. And verily, quoth he, yee Hyrcanians, becau&s;e yee &s;ay, your countrymen u&s;e to march hinmo&s;t, therefore when ye &s;ee them once, give us knowledge that they be of your nation, to the end wee may &s;pare them. The Hyrcanians hearing this, led the way as he commaunded: and withall admired his princely heart and magnanimitie. Neither &s;tood they any more in feare of the A&s;&s;yrians or of the Lydians or yet of any other their Allies and Confederates. And as for <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe, he &s;uppo&s;ed, there lay matter of no &s;mall moment every way in them, were they pre&s;ent with him or were they ab&s;ent. Now as they mar|ched and night drew on, reported it is, that a cleere light &s;hining from heaven, appeared evidently unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> and his ho&s;t, in &s;o much as they all conceived a reverent feare of the Divine power, and a con&s;ident boldne&s;&s;e be&s;ides again&s;t the enemies: and, for that they were lightly appointed and went apace, by good
<PB N="84" REF="52">rea&s;on they made, that night, a great journey, and by breake of day in the very twy-light, approched neere unto the Hyrcanians maine regiment. Which when the me&s;&s;engers above-&s;aid perceived, they &s;ignified unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> that tho&s;e were their countrimen: And hereof, &s;aid they, have we &s;ure intelligence, as well by their marching hinmo&s;t, as by the number of fires which they make. Whereupon hee &s;ent one of the&s;e two unto them, commaunding him in his name to deliver this me&s;&s;age: That if they were his friends, they &s;hould with all &s;peed come and meet him holding up their hands aloft. Some likewi&s;e of his owne men he &s;ent with him, whom he commaunded to &s;ay unto the Hyrca|nians, That as his men &s;hould &s;ee them comming towards him, &s;o they al&s;o would doe the like againe. Thus, one of the me&s;&s;engers tarried &s;till with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and the other rode forth to the Hyrcanians. During the time that <HI>Cyrus</HI> waited to &s;ee what the Hyrcanians would doe, he cau&s;ed his armie to &s;tay the march. Then the Chieftaines of the Medes togither with <HI>Tigranes</HI> galloped hard unto him, demaunding what they were to doe? unto whom he made an&s;were, This troupe next unto us is the regiment of the Hyrcanians: unto whom one of their me&s;&s;engers, accompanied with &s;ome few of our men is gone for to &s;ignifie un|to them, that if they meane to be friends, they &s;hould meet us bearing up all of them their right hands. Wherefore, if they &s;o doe, receive them yee, eve|ry one in his place friendly giving them your right hands, and bid them be of good cheere. But if they either take weapon in hand or goe about to flie, doe your be&s;t, quoth he, to di&s;patch them at fir&s;t, &s;o as not one of them remaine a|live. The&s;e were the directions of <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Meane-while the Hyrcanians, having heard what the me&s;&s;engers &s;aid, were exceeding glad, and quickly mounting on hor&s;ebacke repaired toward them holding up their hands as they had warning &s;o to doe. Semblably the Medes and Per&s;ians did put forth their hands, wel|comed them and bade them take a good heart. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Wee for our parts, quoth he, beleeve now and tru&s;t you Hyrcanians: and even &s;o ought yee to be affected to us ward. But fir&s;t of all, Tell us this, How farre hence is the place where the principall rulers and pui&s;&s;ance of our enemies maine armie are? They an&s;were, &s;omewhat above a Para&s;ang.</P>

<P>WHich when <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard, Goe to then, my deere friends, quoth he, <HI>Per&s;ians, Medes,</HI> and yee <HI>Hyrcanians,</HI> (for now &s;peake I to you as unto Allies and partners with us.) Now ought we to know for certaine in what &s;tate we &s;tand: namely, that if we now become faint hearted and demeane our &s;elves cowardly, we &s;hall incurre the mo&s;t grievous calami|ties that be. For, our enemies know full well, wherefore we are come: but if we &s;hall fiercely &s;et upon our enemies and give the charge with courage and manly re&s;olution, yee &s;hall &s;ee them &s;oone like unto fugitive &s;laves, that are found out and apprehended againe, &s;ome to court us in humble and &s;uppliant manner cry|ing us mercy, others to take them to their heeles: &s;ome againe &s;o maskared, as
<PB N="85" REF="52">they will not be able &s;o much as to thinke either of the one or the other. For, as men once di&s;comfited, they will &s;tare and looke upon us: and &s;u&s;pecting no|thing le&s;&s;e, than that we are comming, they being neither &s;et embattailed nor provided to fight, will be &s;urpri&s;ed. If therefore we de&s;ire to &s;it at &s;upper fee|ding merrily, to pa&s;&s;e the night &s;leeping quietly, and in a word, hereafter to live plea&s;antly: let us give them no re&s;pit, either to con&s;ult or prepare any good thing for them&s;elves, no nor &s;o much as to know at all that we be men: but thinke onely, that nought el&s;e is come among them but bucklers, courtill|axes, glaives, browne-bills and bloudy wounds. And yee <HI>Hyrcanians,</HI> quoth he, &s;tep forward upon them, and make way before us, that by the &s;ight of your armour, we may be in covert and un&s;eene as long as po&s;&s;ible it is. But, when I am come clo&s;e to the enemies armie, leave with me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Armenians, Medes, and Hyrcanians.</NOTE> every of you a cornet of hor&s;emen, to u&s;e as need requireth &s;o long as I abide here with the armie.

But, &s;uffer the younger gallants to follow the chace, and let them have the killing of the enemies. For, this is the &s;afe&s;t way now, that we leave as few of our enemies alive as may be. And if it come to pa&s;&s;e (as it hapneth to many winners) that we quite overthrow their fortunes, and breake their backes for ever, take heed we mu&s;t, that we fall not to pillage. For, he that &s;o doth, is no more a valiant &s;ouldier, but a ba&s;e &s;ouldiers page, and &s;uch an one, any man that will may u&s;e as his &s;lave. This al&s;o ought we to know, that nothing is more gainefull than victory. For, the victour pre&s;ently carrieth all away with him at once, men, women, money and goods, yea and the whole countrey withall. Furthermore, this one thing would be thought upon e&s;pecially: How we may hold and reteine victorie.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> For, in it even the rifler and &s;poyler him&s;elfe is com|pri&s;ed.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> defaited the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> againe, and tooke pri&s;oners, Kings, Lords and other &s;ouldiours agreat number. The order that he gave, how to bee provided pre&s;ently of victuals without confu&s;ion and trouble.</HEAD>
<P>WHen it was day light, the enemies, &s;ome wondred and were a&s;toni|ed at the&s;e occurrents: others perceived at the fir&s;t what the mat|ter was: &s;ome told it as newes: others cryed out: &s;ome unloo&s;ed their hor&s;es: others fell to tru&s;&s;e up bag and baggage, &s;ome flung armour and weapons from of their bea&s;ts backs: others did on their harnois: &s;ome leapt on hor&s;ebacke, others bridled them: &s;ome mounted their wives and women into wagons: others caught up their things of greate&s;t price to &s;ave them: &s;ome againe were taken in the manner as they were hiding the &s;ame in the ground: but the mo&s;t part tooke their heeles. And we mu&s;t thinke, that many and &s;un|dry things they did, &s;ave this onely, that there was not one of them fought, but peri&s;hed without fight. <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> the <HI>Lydian</HI> King had &s;ent away before in the night (for that it was the hote &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on) his wives in Carroches, that du|ring the coole aire, they might travaile more ea&s;ily: and him&s;elfe followed hard after, with his hor&s;emen. Likewi&s;e did, by report, the <HI>Phrygian</HI> Poten|tate who ruled that <HI>Phrygia</HI> which lieth upon <HI>Helle&s;pont.</HI> But when they un|der&s;tood by tho&s;e that fled and overtooke them, how the world went, them|&s;elves fled al&s;o as fa&s;t as ever they could. The KK. of the <HI>Cappadocians</HI> and <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> who were next hand and made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, unarmed and without their curaces, the <HI>Hyrcanians</HI> put to the &s;word. The mo&s;t part of tho&s;e that lo&s;t their lives were <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> and <HI>Arabians.</HI> For, being within their owne land, they made &s;lowe&s;t ha&s;te, and went lea&s;t forward. Whiles the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Hyr|canians</HI> made havocke and execution (as it was no other like) following the chace as they did and having &s;till the upper hand, <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded tho&s;e Cornets of hor&s;emen which were left with him, to ride about the Campe: and whom&s;oever they &s;aw going forth armed, to kill them outright: but to tho&s;e who &s;tayed within, he made proclamation, That what &s;ouldiours &s;o ever of the enemies armie, were either Hor&s;men, Targuatiers or Archers, they &s;hould tru&s;&s;e up their armour and bring it forth, leaving their hor&s;es &s;till at their Pavilions.

<P>Meane while with their arming &s;words ready drawne, they &s;tood in order of battaile round about the tents.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> communed with his Centiniers, per&s;wading them to &s;obriety, and to &s;tay for their fellowes who were in the pur&s;uite: and how they rai&s;ed a great booty of men, women, and goods.</HEAD>
<P>WEE are not ignorant, goods Friends, that you may now if yee will take your dinners before our A&s;&s;ociats that are ab&s;ent, yea and enjoy tho&s;e meats and drinks, which are right exqui&s;itly pro|vided. But I am not per&s;waded, that this dinner and refection of ours, will profit us more, than if it may appeare, that we are carefull of our fellowes and confederates: neither can all this good cheere make us &s;o much the &s;tronger, as this one thing would doe, to wit, if we might be able to cau&s;e our Allies to be forward in ayding us. If therefore, we &s;hould &s;eeme &s;o to vilipend tho&s;e who now follow the chace and execution of our enemies, fighting &s;till with them that make head, as that before we know how they &s;peed, we &s;hould dine and make merry, I feare me, as we &s;hall be noted openly for lewd per&s;ons, &s;o wee &s;hall weaken our &s;elves, when we mi&s;&s;e their aide. But to have &s;uch a care of tho&s;e that take paines and expo&s;e them&s;elves unto daungers, as that when upon their entry into the Campe, they may finde food ready and all things nece&s;&s;ary: This &s;ay I, were a fea&s;t alone, and would make us much more jocund and jo|viall, than if we went by and by to fill and pamper our bellies. Con&s;ider fur|thermore, quoth he, that although it &s;tood us not upon, in mode&s;tie to have
<PB N="88" REF="54">any regard at all of them, yet ought we not at any time, to give our &s;elves to belly cheere and drunkenne&s;&s;e. For, as yet we have not fully atchieved tho&s;e exploits which we enterpri&s;ed, but all things now are come to the very pitch and doubtfull point which requireth carefull diligence. For, we have in the campe enemies in number farre more than we be our &s;elves, and tho&s;e loo&s;e, and at liberty, whom peradventure it were fit to be guarded &s;urely &s;till: yea and care would be had, that there be &s;uch as may purvey us nece&s;&s;aries. Moreover, our hor&s;emen are away, who verily di&s;quiet our minds and make us to mu&s;e where they be: and when they are returned, whether they will &s;tay with us or no? therefore, in mine opinion, &s;uch meat and drinke we are at this time to take and &s;tay our &s;tomacks with, as a man may thinke mo&s;t meete and expedient, thereby neither to be full of drow&s;ie &s;leepe, nor &s;urpri&s;ed with incon&s;iderate folly. I wote well likewi&s;e, that much trea&s;ure there is and other goods in the camp: of which I know it is in our power to convert to our proper u&s;e as much as we li&s;t, how ever the &s;ame be common, as well to tho&s;e who were with us at the winning thereof as to our &s;elves. But I doe not thinke, it would turne more to our gaine, for to &s;eize the &s;aid goods into our owne hands, than if we &s;hew our &s;elves true and ju&s;t unto them, and in &s;o doing purcha&s;e thus much, as that they &s;hall be more fa&s;t and a&s;&s;ured friends unto us than now they are. In the&s;e re&s;pects therefore, I thinke it good to commit the di&s;po&s;e and di&s;tribu|tion of the&s;e monies and goods, to the <HI>Medes, Hyrcanians,</HI> and <HI>Tigranes</HI> at their returne: and &s;ay they deale the le&s;&s;e part among us, yet to reckon even it our gain &amp; advantage. For, by rea&s;on of lucre growing to them ward, more willing they will be to remaine with us. As for our &s;elves, if at this time we &s;hould re|gard our owne commodity before theirs, verily it would gaine us wealth to la&s;t but a &s;mall while. But to let this pillage goe by, and in lieu thereof to have and hold &s;uch things, whereof riches doth ari&s;e, this is it in my judgement, which may yeeld both to us and to all ours, more durable and perpetuall wealth. For this cau&s;e al&s;o, quoth he, I &s;uppo&s;e when we are at home in our owne countrey, we doe inure our &s;elves to ma&s;ter and keepe downe our bellies: to forbeare likewi&s;e unlawfull and unrea&s;onable games: that when need re|quires, we might u&s;e the &s;ame to our weale and commodity. And verily, where we may &s;hew our in&s;titution and bringing up in greater matters, than the&s;e now pre&s;ented unto us, I cannot &s;ee. And herewith made <HI>Cyrus</HI> an end of his &s;peech. This advi&s;e of his, <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI> a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and one of the above-named Peeres appro|ved, and &s;aid as followeth. An indignity and &s;hame it were &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus:</HI> if we ma|ny times in hunting &s;hould continue without meat and all for to take &s;ome wild bea&s;t, and the &s;ame peradventure but little worth: and now when we are in the pur&s;uite of a world of wealth, we be our owne hinderance by tho&s;e things that rule lewd men, and are &s;ubject to the good: &s;o as wee &s;hould not &s;eeme to per|forme what we ought and befitteth us be&s;t to doe. Thus agreed <HI>Hysta&s;pes</HI> with the opinion of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and all the re&s;t allowed thereof. Goe to then &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Since we concurre in one and the &s;ame mind, Send every Caporall out of his owne band five of the talle&s;t and be&s;t men to goe round about, and as many as they &s;ee bu&s;ie in purveiance of nece&s;&s;aries, to command them; but whom&s;oever they perceive &s;lacke in this behalfe, again&s;t them to proceed with more &s;everi|ty, than if they were their very ma&s;ters. And thus verily did <HI>Cyrus</HI> and tho&s;e with him. As for the <HI>Medes,</HI> &s;ome of them who overtooke certaine waines
<PB N="89" REF="54" MS="y">which had gone before, and turned them backe, brought them full loden with &s;uch commodities as the armie had need of. Others tooke and brought away with them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Wagons.</NOTE> Chariots and Carroches, wherein were pa&s;&s;ing faire women: part|ly lawfull wives and in part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ligbies.</NOTE> concubines, &s;uch as for their &s;ingular beauty were carried about and went with the Campe. For, the manner is of all the nations in A&s;ia, even at this day when&s;oever they make any warlike expedition, to take with them along, the mo&s;t precious things they have: &s;aying, That they are the more eger of fight, when their mo&s;t leife and deere&s;t jewels are about them. For, there is a certeine nece&s;&s;itie impo&s;ed upon them, manfully to protect and defend the &s;ame, and even &s;o in very deed perhaps it is: or peradventure thus they doe, to &s;atisfie their lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures. Now <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when hee &s;aw what feats the Medes and Hyrcanians had exploited, check'd, as it were, and rebuked him&s;elfe and his whole traine: in that others at this time &s;eemed to outgoe them in valour, and to winne &s;omewhat: whiles he and tho&s;e about him &s;it &s;till in a place farre remote from performing good &s;ervice, doing ju&s;t nothing. And in truth, they that came away with this &s;aid bootie, had no &s;ooner &s;hewed unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> what they brought, but they rode forth eft&s;oones, to pur&s;ue the re&s;t of the enemies: For &s;o &s;aid they, we have expre&s;&s;e commaundement from our Pro|vo&s;ts and Rulers. <HI>Cyrus</HI> albeit he was &s;tung herewith, yet be&s;towed hee this bootie &s;afe, and laid it up every thing in due place. Then a&s;&s;embled he once a|gaine his Centiniers; and &s;tanding &s;o as he might be heard what&s;oever he &s;pake, made this oration unto them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII. Cyrus</HI> con&s;ulteth with his Centiniers, about mounting footmen on hor&s;ebacke: and erecting a Per&s;ian Cavallerie, with the hor&s;es taken from the enemie in the warres.</HEAD>
<P>MY good friends, Wee all, I &s;uppo&s;e, doe know, that if we may at|chieve tho&s;e matters, which fortune at this time pre&s;enteth unto us: as, there &s;hall accrue much profit unto the Per&s;ians all in common: &s;o the greate&s;t part of good right will be ours, by who&s;e travaile the &s;ervice is done. But, how we &s;hould be Lords thereof, being not of &s;ufficient &s;trength to enjoy and hold the &s;ame, unle&s;&s;e we have a Per&s;ian Cavallerie of our owne, truly I cannot yet &s;ee. For, con&s;ider I pray you with mee, that wee Per&s;ians are furni&s;hed with tho&s;e weapons, wherewith we may &s;eeme to foyle and di&s;|comfit our enemies at clo&s;e fight: but when wee have once routed them, what Hor&s;emen, what Archers, what Targuaters, or what Darters, can we either take pri&s;oners or kill as they flie, wanting hor&s;es as we doe? And why &s;hould either Archers, or Darters, or Hor&s;emen, be affraid to a&s;&s;aile us and worke us mi&s;chiefe, &s;o long as they know for certeine, that they &s;tand in no daunger to receive hurt from us, no more than from the very trees that grow fa&s;t in the ground? Which being &s;o, is it not evident, that tho&s;e men of armes who now a&s;&s;i&s;t us, doe thinke that all the&s;e preies which now are taken, be no le&s;&s;e their owne than ours? yea and perhaps more too, &s;o helpe me Iupiter. Thus there|fore &s;tands the ca&s;e now, and it cannot otherwi&s;e be: But if wee may provide our &s;elves of a Cavallerie, out of our owne nation, not inferiour to this of theirs,
<PB N="90" REF="55">is it not very apparant unto you all, that we &s;hall be able to doe as much again&s;t our enemies without them as now we doe with them? and be&s;ides, finde even them more mode&s;t in their carriage and re&s;pective towards us? So that wee &s;hall need the le&s;&s;e to care whether they will &s;tay with us, or bee gone, &s;eeing that without their helpe we &s;hall be &s;ufficient of our &s;elves. Well, Let this goe by: For I thinke no man will gaine&s;ay this opinion, but that it is every way and &s;imply better, for the Per&s;ians to have Hor&s;emen of their owne. But hap|ly yee thinke with your &s;elves, How this may be brought about? If then, we de&s;ire to &s;et up a Cavallery, let us take into our con&s;ideration what we have to|ward it, and what we want? Hor&s;es we have the&s;e here, in number many, taken already in the Campe, bridles we have for to rule and keepe them in: with o|ther things be&s;ides meet for tho&s;e to occupie, that have hor&s;es. We have more|over all that a man of Armes needeth to u&s;e: For defen&s;ive armour, bre&s;tplates to protect our bodies: For offen&s;ive weapons, Darts and Iavelins which wee may launce from us, or keepe &s;till in our hands as we plea&s;e. What lacke wee then? Belike, men we have need of: but of them we are be&s;t &s;ped. For, no|thing is &s;o much our owne, as we our &s;elves be ours. But peradventure, &s;ome man will &s;ay, we are not skilfull in hor&s;eman&s;hip. Neither was there, I a&s;&s;ure you, any one of them cunning in that which now they can skill of, before hee was taught the feat of it. And haply another will object and &s;ay, that they lear|ned it when they were young children. But I pray you, good Sir, Whether are children more apt and of better capacitie, to learne &s;uch things as are told and &s;hewed unto them, than men growne? or whether when they have lear|ned them, are childrens bodies or mens, more able to put the &s;ame in practi&s;e? Now, for our &s;elves wee have &s;uch opportunitie to learne, as neither children nor any other men have &s;o much. For, wee &s;hall not need to be taught the feat of &s;hooting, as children are; con&s;idering that we know it already: nor the &s;leight of darting; for wee can doe it well enough. Nor is it with us as with o|ther men: who are, &s;ome, troubled about tillage and husbandry: others hin|dred by trades, arts, and occupations: and &s;ome againe letted with dorne&s;ticall affaires: Whereas wee, are not onely induced by time and lea&s;ure, to menage martiall feats, but al&s;o driven thereto upon nece&s;&s;itie. Moreover, it is not in this, as in many other warlike points, which may well be profitable, but yet are difficile and hard. For, is it not more ea&s;ie and plea&s;ant to ride our journeys, then to goe them on foot? When there is required expedition and &s;peed, is it not a great plea&s;ure, to be &s;treightwaies with a mans friend? yea and in the pur&s;uit of man or bea&s;t, quickly if need requires, to out&s;trip and intercept them? Is not this al&s;o very hand&s;ome and convenient, that what armour &s;oever is to be worne or weapon borne, a mans hor&s;e &s;hould carry both it and him? For, truly it is all one to weare, and to beare the &s;ame. Now for that, which we may &s;eeme to feare mo&s;t, namely, lea&s;t if wee be put of nece&s;&s;itie, to try the fortune of a battaile on hor&s;ebacke, before wee have atteined to the exqui&s;ite skill of riding, wee prove neither good footmen nor fufficient hor&s;emen: This is not &s;o hard a matter but it may be well avoided. For, when and where&s;oever we li&s;t, we may &s;oone alight and fight on foot: neither &s;hall we in learning to ride, forget our footman&s;hip or the &s;ervice thereto belonging. Thus &s;pake <HI>Cy|rus:</HI> and <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> &s;econding his &s;peech, delivered his mind after this &s;ort.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> by the coun&s;ell and advi&s;e of his mo&s;t politick Captaines, ordeined in his armie, a troupe of Hor&s;emen, &s;erving upon the A&s;&s;yrians hor&s;es: and intended to &s;et at large all his pri&s;oners.</HEAD>
<P>TRVLY for mine owne part, quoth he, &s;o de&s;irous I am to learne the feat of riding, that were I once a hor&s;eman, I would thinke that ever after I had wings and flew. For now, being as I am, it would content me pa&s;&s;ing well, if &s;triving a-vie with any man to run a race on even ground, I could but get afore him by the head, and if &s;eeing a wild bea&s;t running by me, I might &s;o aime mine arrow or levell my dart as to &s;trike and hit him, before he be gotten a great way of. But were I &s;et once on hor&s;ebacke, I &s;hould be able to kill a man, &s;o farre of as I could &s;ee him, and in chacing of wild bea&s;ts, I would not doubt to confront and kill &s;ome at hand, to &s;trike others al&s;o aloofe with my javelin, as if they &s;tood &s;till. For, although man and bea&s;t both of them run &s;wiftly, yet drawing nigh togither, they &s;eeme as though they &s;tood. And verily mee thinks of all living creatures I can admire mo&s;t and wi&s;h to re|&s;emble the Hippocentaures, if ever any &s;uch were; as who in fore-ca&s;t, u&s;ed mens prudence in managing that which was to be done, their hands: in taking that which fled, and in overthrowing what&s;oever &s;tayed and &s;tood &s;till, the &s;wiftne&s;&s;e and &s;trength of an hor&s;e. Therefore, if I were an hor&s;eman, I would I trow be furni&s;hed with all the&s;e togither. For, having humane rea&s;on and un|der&s;tanding of mine owne, I mought bee able to fore&s;ee all: in my hands I &s;hould be able to beare and weld my weapons: with my hor&s;e-feet to pur&s;ue, and with his &s;trength, to lay my concurrent along. Neither yet &s;hould I be &s;o conjoyned and growne togither unto my hor&s;e, as Hippocentaures are. And indeed better is it, thus to be, than &s;o united and concorporate. For, the Hip|pocentaures I &s;uppo&s;e, were ignorant, how to u&s;e many good things invented by men, as al&s;o how to enjoy many plea&s;ures and delights, which hor&s;es natu|rally have: whereas I, having learned once to ride, &s;hall whiles I am on hor&s;e|backe, performe in &s;ome &s;ort what belongs to an Hippocentaure: and when I am alighted on foot, dine and &s;uppe, weare my clothes, and doe as other men doe: what el&s;e therefore &s;hall I be but an Hippocentaure divided one while, and compounded againe another while? Be&s;ides, in this one point more, I &s;hall have the vantage of an Hippocentaure and excell him. For whereas he &s;aw be|fore him with two eyes, and heard with two eares onely, I certeinly &s;hall gue&s;&s;e at things with foure eyes, and have the ynkling and intelligence of them by the meanes of foure eares. For, it is &s;aid, that an hor&s;e, by the fore-&s;ight of his eye, warneth a man of many occurrents, yea and adverti&s;eth him no le&s;&s;e, by the foreknowledge that he hath with his eares. Enroll mee therefore in the li&s;t with them, that would mo&s;t gladly be hor&s;emen. And us al&s;o, for Gods &s;ake, &s;aid all the re&s;t. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Seeing we are &s;o fully accorded, What if we make a law unto our &s;elves, that it &s;hall be a &s;hamefull reproch, for any of them to whom I &s;hall give hor&s;es, to be &s;eene abroad on foote, be the journey that they take, great or &s;mall? that men may thinke us to bee very Hippocentaures in|deed? Thus when he had propo&s;ed this law, they all gave their a&s;&s;ent and ena|cted
<PB N="92" REF="56">the &s;ame. Hereupon it is, that ever &s;ince that time, unto this pre&s;ent day, there is not a man of worth and haviour among the Per&s;ians, &s;eene by his good will to goe on foot. Thus debated they the&s;e matters, and di&s;cour&s;ed as yee have heard. By which time it was pa&s;t noone: and then, the Median and Hyr|canian hor&s;emen, came riding towards them, bringing both hor&s;es and men whom they had taken pri&s;oners. For, they did not put any one of them to the &s;word, who had delivered up their weapons. Being come, <HI>Cyrus</HI> demaunded of them, Fir&s;t, whether they were all &s;afe? And when they an&s;wered yea; he asked them what they had exploited? Who made report of their &s;ervice done: and how valiantly they had performed every thing in particular, they &s;tucke not to &s;et out to the full, in mo&s;t brave words. Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> had with plea|&s;ure heard all that they were di&s;po&s;ed to relate, he fell afterwards to prai&s;ing of them likewi&s;e, in the&s;e termes. Certes, it appeareth very well, my good friends, that yee have borne your &s;elves right manfully. For, &s;urely yee are now farre greater, fairer and more terrible to &s;ee to, than heretofore. He enquired more|over of them, how great a journey they had made? and whether the country were inhabited or no? Who made an&s;wer, that they had ridden over a great ground: that the land throughout was inhabited, and repleni&s;hed with Sheepe, Goats, Neat, Hor&s;es, Corne and all good commodities. Then, quoth he, two things are we to looke unto. The one, that we may have the &s;overaintie over them who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e this wealth: the other, that they remaine where they be. For a countrey well peopled is a rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and worth much: whereas, if the &s;ame lye de&s;ert and abandoned of men, it mu&s;t needs be de&s;titute al&s;o of all good things. I know full well, that &s;laine yee have tho&s;e which made re&s;i|&s;tance: Wherein yee did well, I a&s;&s;ure you (for this is it that chiefely main|teineth victory) but &s;uch as yeelded yee have taken pri&s;oners and brought a|way: Whom if we let goe, wee &s;hall, as I thinke, doe well for our owne be|halfe. For, fir&s;t we need not now to take order how to beware of them, how to keepe them in &s;afe cu&s;todie, or to finde them food, and with hunger truly we will never kill them. Then, if wee &s;et the&s;e at libertie, we &s;hall &s;till meet with more captives. For, Conquer wee once the country, all the dwellers therein will be our captives. Yea and the re&s;t will the &s;ooner tarry, chu&s;ing rather to obey, than to fight it out, if they &s;ee the&s;e remaining alive and let goe at large. This is mine opinion. If any man &s;ee farther into the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, let him &s;peake his minde. But they having heard his advi&s;e, agreed, that the &s;ame &s;hould be done accordingly. <HI>Cyrus</HI> therefore calling unto him the &s;aid pri&s;o|ners, &s;pake thus unto them.</P>

Will any one of you come to us in friendly manner, and be &s;eene either to performe any action and to teach us ought? him will we entertaine, and intreat, as one de&s;erving well of us: as a friend I &s;ay, and in no wi&s;e as a &s;lave. Thus much, quoth he, would I have you both to know, your &s;elves, and al&s;o to intimate unto others. Now if yee for your parts be willing to condi&s;cend hereunto, and yet &s;ome other will not con|&s;ent, lead yee us again&s;t tho&s;e, to the end that we may rule them, and not they us. When he had thus &s;aid, they with great reverence did obei&s;ance unto him, and withall promi&s;ed &s;o to doe. After that they were departed, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;pake in this wi&s;e, It is time now &ocirc; yee Medes and Armenians both, that we all goe to our &s;uppers. And behold, we have prepared for you the be&s;t cheere we could get. Goe your wayes therefore and &s;end us halfe your bread that is purveied and ready made, for there is &s;ufficient provided for both. As for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. what&s;oever is eaten be&s;ide bread.</NOTE> meat be&s;ide and drinke &s;end us none. For we have thereof with us enough prepared alrea|dy. And yee Hyrtanians, quoth he, bring the&s;e men to their lodgings; the chiefe and principall Commaunders to the be&s;t and large&s;t, (yee know whither well enough) the re&s;t as yee &s;hall thinke mo&s;t meet and convenient. Take yee al&s;o your &s;uppers your &s;elves where yee be&s;t like. For, the tents are kept &s;afe and untouched for you, and therein is provi&s;ion to &s;erve you as well as them. And this know yee both, that for all matters without doores, wee will for you keepe watch and ward this night: Looke yee your &s;elves to tho&s;e things that are within the pavilions, and therein be&s;tow your harnois and weapons. For, they be not yet our friends all, that are in the &s;aid tents. So the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Ti|granes</HI> his &s;ouldiers wa&s;hed (for all things were prepared to their hands) and af|ter they had &s;hifted their clothes went to &s;upper. Their hor&s;es al&s;o had forage and provender enough. Moreover they &s;ent unto the Per&s;ians of their bread halfe a loafe to every one: but neither cates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cates, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> nor wine thereto did they &s;end: &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>Cyrus</HI> and his companie had &s;ufficient thereof, becau&s;e him&s;elfe had &s;aid, he was well &s;tored therewith. But indeed <HI>Cyrus</HI> meant by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Cates, Hunger, and by drinke, the water of the river running thereby. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> having cau&s;ed the Per&s;ians to take their &s;uppers, for that now by this time the night drew on, &s;ent many of them divers wayes by five and ten in a company, commaunding them to lye clo&s;e and in covert round about the tents. For, thus he thought, that the&s;e would &s;erve both as a good watch and guard, to keepe backe any that from without attempted to enter in: and al&s;o by this meanes who&s;oever intended to make an e&s;cape out of the campe, and convey money away with them, they &s;hould be intercepted and taken in the manner. And even &s;o in very truth it fell out. For, many fled, and many were apprehended. As for the money found about them, <HI>Cyrus</HI> left it behind, for tho&s;e to have, who had taken paines to attach them, but the men them&s;elves he cau&s;ed to bee killed: Whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e afterwards, that you could not ea&s;ily, would you never &s;o faine, have found one going out of the Campe by night. Thus
<PB N="94" REF="57">verily the Per&s;ians be&s;towed their time: whereas the Medes fell all the while to drinking, banquetting, piping and revelling in all kinde of jollitie to the full. For &s;o many things and of &s;uch varietie were taken, as that the watchmen had worke enough, to employ them&s;elves thereabout.</P>

<P>TO returne now unto <HI>Cyaxares</HI> the King of the <HI>Medes.</HI> He the very night that <HI>Cyrus</HI> made this rode forth, dranke him&s;elfe drunke, togither with tho&s;e who conver&s;ed with him and were quartered about him (like as in time of pro&s;perity,) and al&s;o thought that the other <HI>Medes</HI> were all in their tents, except &s;ome few, becau&s;e he heard &s;o great a noi&s;e. For, the <HI>Medes</HI> do|me&s;ticke &s;ervants, as who&s;e ma&s;ters were now gone forth and ab&s;ent, fell to quaffing riotou&s;ly, yea and kept a great &s;tirre with much howting, The rather, for that out of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> armie and campe they had &s;ped them&s;elves with wine and many other &s;uch things. But when it was day, and not one repaired into the Pre&s;ence within his Royall Pavilion, but &s;uch as &s;upped with the King overnight: and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cyaxares.</NOTE> hearing withall, that the Campe was void of <HI>Medes</HI> and their hor&s;es: &s;eeing al&s;o when he went out him&s;elfe, that &s;o it was: then fumed he and chafed both again&s;t <HI>Cyrus</HI> and the <HI>Medes</HI> al&s;o, for that they were departed and had left him de&s;olate: whereupon he gave commaundement forthwith, (as he was, by report, cruell and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Witle&s;&s;e, or undi&s;creete <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> unrea&s;onable,) to one of tho&s;e about him, to take his owne troupe of hor&s;emen, and in all ha&s;t to ride unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> his ho&s;t, and in his name to deliver this me&s;&s;age. I did not thinke, that either you <HI>Cyrus,</HI> would have dealt with me &s;o incon&s;iderately: nor if <HI>Cyrus</HI> had beene &s;o minded, that yee <HI>Medes</HI> would ever have left me in this manner &s;olitary: Now therefore if <HI>Cyrus</HI> will, be it &s;o: But whether he will or no, See that yee with all &s;peed make repaire unto me. Thus commaunded he. But the Captaine appointed to goe with this errand, replied thus unto him, And how, quoth he, my<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Liege, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Lord &s;hall I find them out? Why! quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> How did <HI>Cyrus</HI> and tho&s;e with him find out them to whom they went? Becau&s;e Sir, quoth he, I heare &s;ay, that certaine <HI>Hyrcanians</HI> revolted from the enemies, and being hither come, went away as guides to conduct them in their journey. When <HI>Cyaxares</HI> heard this, he was much more wroth and angry with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> becau&s;e hee had not acquainted him therewith: and he made the more ha&s;t to &s;end unto the <HI>Medes,</HI> thereby to leave <HI>Cyrus</HI> more naked and de&s;titute: And &s;o, with greater menaces than before, hee cited the <HI>Medes</HI> peremptorily. Threatning the Captaine afore|&s;aid likewi&s;e, if he delivered not this me&s;&s;age &s;toutly and in &s;harpe termes. So, tooke he his leave that was &s;ent, accompanied with &s;ome hundred hor&s;emen of his owne, being angry in his heart that he went not him&s;elfe this voyage with <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Now, as they were upon their journey, by rea&s;on of certaine turnings where the waies were divided, they chaunced upon a wrong by-lane, and &s;o wandred out of the right way they wi&s;t not whither: in &s;o much as they could not come unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> his armie, untill they hapned upon &s;ome of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="57">whom they con&s;trained to be their guides. By this meanes having e&s;pied the fires, they came thither about mid-night. Now, when they approached hard to the campe, the watchmen, according as they had in charge from <HI>Cyrus,</HI> would not let them in before day. But by day-breake <HI>Cyrus</HI> fir&s;t &s;ent for the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Prie&s;ts.</NOTE> Magi, whom hee commaunded to chu&s;e forth, according to the u&s;uall and &s;olemne manner, offrings unto the Gods, for &s;o good &s;ucce&s;&s;e and &s;o rich booties. And whiles they were bu&s;ied hereabout, him&s;elfe a&s;&s;embled the Peeres, and thus un|to them &s;aid. My Friends and Countrimen, God pre&s;enteth unto us many good things; But we &ocirc; <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> are at this time too few, for to have and hold the &s;ame. For, whether it be, that what&s;oever we have gotten, becau&s;e we &s;hall not be able to keepe, the &s;ame mu&s;t returne againe into the hands of others: or whe|ther we leave &s;ome of our owne forces for the cu&s;todie of our winnings, it will be &s;oone &s;eene, that little or no &s;trength remaineth with us: I thinke it good therefore, that one of you &s;hould with all &s;peed go into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> both to enforme the State what I &s;ay, and to will them, with all expedition to &s;end a power, in ca&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> de&s;ire to have the Dominion, and enjoy the fruits of Afia. Goe you therefore quoth he to one, Goe you I &s;ay that are mo&s;t auncient, and being thither come deliver thus much: and &s;ay moreover, that how many &s;ouldiers &s;o ever they &s;end, after they be come unto me, I will care for their finding and maintenance. What we have, your &s;elfe &s;eeth: and conceale I advi&s;e you no|thing thereof. Of all this pillage here, what oblation I may &s;end e&s;pecially in|to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in decent manner and lawfully, (as pertaining to the Gods,) enquire that of my father; but as concerning the Common-wealth, con&s;ult with the chiefe Magi&s;trates. Moreover, let them &s;end certaine Over&s;eers of what we doe: as al&s;o expo&s;itours unto us of &s;uch points as we aske and demaund. Thus quoth he make you ready, and take your owne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> a com|pany of a hun|dred, &s;ometime a crue of ten or twelue.</NOTE> band to accompanie you. This done, he called unto him the <HI>Medes.</HI> And at the &s;ame in&s;tant was the me&s;&s;enger above|&s;aid of <HI>Cyaxares</HI> brought in and had audience. Who in the pre&s;ence and hearing of them all, declared the indignation of <HI>Cyaxares</HI> again&s;t <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as al&s;o his threats unto the <HI>Medes.</HI> In conclu&s;ion, he &s;aid, That <HI>Cyaxares</HI> commaunded the <HI>Medes</HI> to depart, [from <HI>Cyrus</HI>] although he would have them to tarry: Which me&s;|&s;age when the <HI>Medes</HI> heard, they kept &s;ilence, being in doubt and perplexity how they might di&s;obey him, &s;ending for them in this manner: and fearing as much on the other &s;ide, how to obey him menacing thus as he did; e&s;pe|cially knowing his cruell nature. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> For mine owne part quoth hee, you the Me&s;&s;enger, and yee my Friends the <HI>Medes,</HI> I nothing marvaile, if <HI>Cy|axares</HI> &s;eeing our enemies then, to be &s;o many, and not knowing now what we doe, be much troubled both for us and al&s;o for him&s;elfe. But when hee &s;hall once under&s;tand, that a number of our enemies be &s;laine and all the re&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to flight: Fir&s;t he will give over his feare, and afterwards acknowledge, that hee is not now left de&s;olate when as his Friends thus de&s;troy his foes. And how are we blame-worthy de&s;erving &s;o well of him, and namely enterpri&s;ing nought of our owne heads? For, I per&s;waded him&s;elfe, fir&s;t to licence me to take you out with me in this journey: and yee againe, not as men very de&s;irous to bee gone, asked him whether yee might goe forth? And &s;o, come hither now yee are in deed; but commaunded by him to goe forth, &s;o many at lea&s;t wi&s;e of you as thought not much and were not unwilling thereto. And therefore, a&s;|&s;ured I am, that this anger of his will both upon the&s;e good exploits of ours be
<PB N="96" REF="58">concocted, and al&s;o with the cea&s;&s;ing of his feare vani&s;h away and come to no|thing. And you good me&s;&s;enger, quoth hee, for this time, becau&s;e you have travailed hard and are weary, re&s;t your &s;elfe. As for you <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> For that we expect the&s;e our enemies will be here, either to fight it out, or el&s;e to yeeld, let vs be bravely appointed in the be&s;t manner; for being thus &s;cene, great likeli|hood there is, that we &s;ooner &s;hall effect what we de&s;ire. As to you the Prince of the <HI>Hyrcanians,</HI> tarry you here, and commaund the Captains of your &s;ouldiers to &s;ee them armed. Which when the <HI>Hyrcanian</HI> Prince had done accordingly and was come vnto him: I take great plea&s;ure [my Lord] quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to per|ceive, that not onely you are here pre&s;ent to &s;hew your friend&s;hip, but al&s;o that you &s;eeme unto me wi&s;e and politick. And verily, at &s;uch a time as this, the &s;ame I am certaine may much availe us. For, as the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> be mine enemies, &s;o they are now more malicious to you than to me. We are therefore on both parts &s;o to con&s;ult, as that of tho&s;e our Allies which be now pre&s;ent, none re|volt from us; and that we may, if po&s;&s;ible it be, procure more to &s;ide with us. Yee have heard how this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Captaine or Me&s;&s;enger.</NOTE> <HI>Median</HI> here calleth away the Hor&s;emen home: and if they depart, how &s;hall we footmen onely remaine behind? Wherefore, both yee and I mu&s;t order the matter &s;o, that this me&s;&s;enger who thus calleth for them away, may be willing him&s;elfe to &s;tay with us. Doe you therefore find out a Pavilion and appoint it for him, wherein he may keepe and live right gal|lantly, as being furni&s;hed with all nece&s;&s;aries what&s;oever. For mine owne part, I &s;hall devi&s;e to &s;et the man about &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, as wherein hee will be more willingly employed, than depart from hence. Di&s;cour&s;e you with him, what hope there is of great availes comming toward us and all our friends, if tho&s;e matters &s;peed well which are meet to bee performed. When you have thus done, repaire eft&s;oones unto me. So the <HI>Hyrcanian</HI> Potentate went his way and brought the &s;aid <HI>Median</HI> unto his tent. And the me&s;&s;enger addre&s;&s;ed for <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was there pre&s;ent, pre&s;t and ready to take his journey. Vnto him <HI>Cyrus</HI> gave in charge, For to &s;ay unto the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> what was declared in the former confe|rence, but unto <HI>Cyaxares</HI> to deliver letters. And I will &s;aith he, read unto you what I writ, that you may bee both privy thereto, and al&s;o able to avow the &s;ame, if any one doe enquire of you as touching their contents.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>The Mi&s;sive of</HI> Cyrus <HI>to</HI> Cyaxares.</HEAD>
<P>NOw the tenour of the &s;aid Epi&s;tle was this: <HI>Cyrus</HI> to <HI>Cyaxares</HI> Greeting. Neither have we left you de&s;olate, [good Vnkle,] (For no man is then de&s;titute of friends when he hath the upper hand of his enemies) nor in departing from you thinke we, that wee expo&s;ed you to any daunger. But the farther that we are from you, the more in our conceit wee worke your &s;afety. For, they that keepe neere&s;t unto their friends, provide not alwaies be&s;t for their &s;ecurity: but &s;uch as drive their enemies farthe&s;t of, tho&s;e be they that &s;et their friends in greate&s;t &s;urety. Con&s;ider moreover, how I have carried my &s;elfe to|wards you, and in what &s;ort againe, you have dealt with me. Then, complaine of me and &s;pare not. For my &s;elfe, I brought unto you Auxiliaries and Con|federates, not &s;o many as you per&s;waded, but as many as po&s;&s;ibly I could. And
<PB N="97" REF="58">you verily, whiles I was yet in our friends countrey, graunted unto me as many as I could by per&s;wa&s;ion win: But now whiles I am in the enemies land, you call away not every voluntarie, but generally all without exception. Certes, at that time I thought my &s;elfe beholden both to you and them: whereas now; you force me as to forget you, &s;o to endeavour all that ever I can, to thanke and requite tho&s;e wholly, that followed me: Howbeit for all this, I can not be like unto you. But even at this pre&s;ent, &s;ending as I doe into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> for an armie, I charge as many as &s;hall come unto me, that, before they repaire unto us, if you &s;tand in any need of them, they doe you &s;ervice, not as they will them&s;elves, but as it plea&s;eth you to employ them. And withall, I would advi&s;e you, youn|ger though I be than your &s;elfe, not to revoke your gifts, and take tho&s;e things away which you have once given, lea&s;t in &s;tead of thanks, evill will and heart-burning be your guerdon: nor to &s;ummon in minatory maner, when you would have any one to repaire &s;peedily unto you: ne yet when you give out, that you are forlorne, withall to threaten many; for feare, you teach them to vilipend and &s;et light by you. As for us, we will doe our be&s;t to be with you &s;o &s;oone as we have with all expedition performed tho&s;e exploits, which being once at|chieved, we are per&s;waded will redound indifferently to the profit of us both. Farewell. Deliver this letter unto him, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus;</HI> and if he aske you concer|ning any of the&s;e points, an&s;wer accordingly to that which is therein written. For, as touching the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> al&s;o I give you commi&s;&s;ion to doe as it is &s;et down in writing. When he had thus &s;aid and given him the mi&s;&s;ive, he &s;ent him away, with a charge &s;o to make ha&s;t, as he knew that his &s;peedy returne would be ex|pedient. After this, immediately he tooke a &s;urvey of the <HI>Hyrcanians</HI> and <HI>Ti|granes</HI> his &s;ouldiers all in armes: The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> likewi&s;e were armed. By which time al&s;o certaine of the marches brought away their hor&s;es and pre&s;ented their armour and weapons. But tho&s;e hee willed to fling away their javelins into that place whither he had before commaunded the re&s;t: and &s;uch as were ap|pointed thereto, for to &s;et them on fire, as many I meane, as they them&s;elves had no need of. As for the hor&s;es, he charged tho&s;e that brought them, to keep; and to tarry &s;till them&s;elves, untill &s;ome notice were given unto them what they &s;hould doe. But to the Captaines of the Hor&s;emen and to the <HI>Hyrcanians,</HI> whom he a&s;&s;embled together, he made this oration.</P>

<P>MErvaile not my good Friends and loving Confederates, that I call you &s;o often togither: For &s;eeing our pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition is new, many occurrents therein are di&s;ordered and out of frame. And looke, what things be out of order, the &s;ame of nece&s;&s;ity make worke for new trouble, untill they be well &s;ettled in their due place: At this time, much trea&s;ure wee have gotten, many men be&s;ides taken pri&s;oners. And becau&s;e neither wee our &s;elves doe know, what goods properly belong to every of us, nor they, what &s;everally they be owners and ma&s;ters of: therefore a man &s;hall hardly &s;ee very
<PB N="98" REF="59">many of them doing what they ought to doe: but all of them in manner, doubt|full what is to be done. To redre&s;&s;e therefore this inconvenience, divide the &s;aid goods; and who&s;oever hath received a tent, &s;tored &s;ufficiently with meate and drinke, with &s;ervitours to attend, with hangings and counterpoints, with appa|rell, with other furniture and implements, meete for a warlike Pavilion to bee dwelt in conveniently, thereto verily needeth, no other addition but this, that the receiver know, he is to take charge of the&s;e things, as if they were his owne: but who&s;e chaunce is it to meet with tents unfurni&s;hed of many nece&s;&s;aries, it is your part to &s;ee unto them, and to &s;upply their wants. Certes, there will be yet, of many things, I know, a &s;urplu&s;age. For, our enemies had of all &s;orts above the proportion of our number. There came moreover unto me the Trea&s;urers of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King, and of the other Potentates, who &s;aid, they had under their hands gold in ready coine: making mention therewith, of certaine tributes. Proclaime therefore and commaund, that they bring forth all before you, where&s;oever yee &s;it downe and make abode: Terrifie them withall, in ca&s;e any one doe not according to your commaundement. Now, when yee have recei|ved the &s;ame monies: deale the &s;ame, to every hor&s;man a double &s;hare, to a foot|man a &s;ingle, that yee may have, what yee need, and wherewith al&s;o to buy &s;omewhat be&s;ide. Moreover, let proclamation be made forthwith in the mer|cate place within the Campe, that no man wrong another. Al&s;o, that retailers and merchants may &s;ell every man what wares and chaffer hee bringeth: and when he hath had utterance and made returne, that he fetch more, to the end that our campe may be well peopled and inhabited. And this verily they pro|claimed our of hand.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Hyrcanians,</HI> How &s;hall wee, &s;aid they, without you and yours, di&s;tribute the&s;e things? To the&s;e words of theirs replied <HI>Cyrus</HI> in this manner: And are yee in deed, (my friends) of this mind, that when ought is to be done, we &s;hould all be pre&s;ent at every affaire? So that if either I negoti|ate for you in any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e requi&s;ite, or yee deale for me, wee &s;hall not &s;atisfie and content one another? And by what other meanes, &s;hall we bu&s;ie our &s;elves more, and effect le&s;&s;e, than by this? But, con&s;ider I pray you, quoth he, we have here kept the&s;e things for you, and yee beleeve, I doubt not that they have been well kept. Semblably, di&s;tribute yee the &s;ame: and wee will likewi&s;e beleeve, that they are very well di&s;tributed: and even &s;o in other things againe, we will endeavour to doe &s;omewhat el&s;e for the good of all in publike. Fir&s;t therefore quoth he, See how many hor&s;es we have here? and how many are a bringing to us? If we &s;uffer them to be without riders, they will &s;erve us in no &s;tead, but put us to trouble in keeping of them. But if we &s;et men upon their backs, wee &s;hall be rid of trouble, and withall, augment our owne &s;trength. Now if ye know any other to be&s;tow them upon, with whom yee would more willingly hazard your &s;elves and enter into daunger (if need be) than with us, let tho&s;e have them. But if yee had leifer that we &s;tand to you and helpe at a pinch, before all other, give them unto us. For, erewhile, when yee made a rode and adventured with|out us, yee did put us greatly in feare, that all was not well with you: and be|&s;ides, yee cau&s;ed us to be much affraied for that wee were not where yee were. But if we receive hor&s;es, follow you we will: and if, fighting on hor&s;ebacke to|gither with you, we may be thought to doe you better &s;ervice; there &s;hall be no courage nor forwardne&s;&s;e wanting on our behalfe. But, in ca&s;e we &s;hall be
<PB N="99" REF="59">thought to &s;tand you in better &s;tead on foot: &s;oone will we alight from our hor|&s;es, and &s;traight waies be with you as footmen: and as for our hor&s;es, devi&s;e we will whom to deliver them unto. Thus &s;aid he: and thereto they made an&s;wer in this wi&s;e.

For, we I may tell you, have not beene overwantonly brought up in deinty delicates, but after an homely and ru&s;ticall manner: whereby, haply, yee would make good game at us, if any rich or goodly apparell were hung up|on us: like as, quoth he, I wote well we &s;hould make you very good &s;port, and moove you to laugh right heartily, as we &s;it on hor&s;ebacke, and namely, as I &s;up|po&s;e, when we take falls and lie along on the ground.

<P>WHILES they were bu&s;ied about the&s;e affaires, <HI>Gobryas</HI> the A&s;&s;y|rian an aged man, &s;hewed him&s;elfe on hor&s;ebacke with a brave re|tinue of his men of Armes.

Now tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Sergeants. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> officers who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion it was to receive the afore&s;aid armes and weapons, commaunded him and his companie to deliver up unto them their launces, that they might burne them as they did the re&s;t. But <HI>Gobryas</HI> &s;aid, that hee was de&s;irous to &s;ee <HI>Cyrus</HI> fir&s;t. Whereupon the &s;aid officers, leaving all his other Hor&s;emen be|hind, brought <HI>Gobryas</HI> in per&s;on before <HI>Cyrus:</HI> who when he &s;aw <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;pake thus unto him. My Lord, I am by birth an A&s;&s;yrian. A &s;trong Ca&s;tle I hold, and have the &s;overaine rule of a large territory. With a thou&s;and hor&s;e I &s;er|ved the A&s;&s;yrian King, whom I friended loyally, no man more. Now &s;ithence his hap hath beene (good Prince as he was) to be &s;laine by you; and &s;eeing his &s;onne my mo&s;t mortall enemie &s;ucceedeth him in the Empire; I am come unto you, humbly kneeling and falling downe pro&s;trate at your feet. And here I yeeld and &s;ubmit my &s;elfe unto you, as your va&s;&s;all, ready to doe you &s;ervice, be&s;eeching you to revenge my wrongs, and as much as lyeth in me, I adopt you for my &s;onne, as having no i&s;&s;ue male of mine owne body begotten. For, the onely &s;onne and heire that I had, (my Lord) who, though I &s;ay it, was a gallant young Gentleman and vertuous withall, one who loved and honoured mee &s;o as any child might doe, and by that dutifull honour make me his father a mo&s;t happie man, him this Prince who now doth reigne, when as the late King his father had &s;ent for him, intending to be&s;tow upon my &s;aid &s;onne, his owne daughter in marriage (and verily when I &s;ent him from mee, I carried my head aloft, as one who looked to &s;ee my &s;onne another day affied to a Kings daugh|ter) him I &s;ay the King that now is permitted to hunt and chace the be&s;t hee could, as counting him&s;elfe a better hor&s;eman than he was by many degrees. So hee hunted with him as with his very friend. And when there was a Beare rowzed in&s;ight and both of them followed the Game, the Prince who now reigneth, flung his dart from him, and as ill lucke was mi&s;&s;ed. But that &s;onne of mine, (alas the while) launced likewi&s;e, and in an ill houre, ywis, and un|&s;ea&s;onably, hit his marke and overthrew the Beare. Whereat, for the pre&s;ent verily, the other (vexed though he was) kept in his envie. Againe, when upon the pre&s;enting of a Lion which encountred them, hee failed the &s;econd time (which was as I thinke no great mervaile) my &s;onne likewi&s;e as before, hapned to kill the Lion outright: and thereupon &s;aid, Certes, twice now togither have I darted and both times &s;trucken, and laid the bea&s;ts along. Then verily at
<PB N="101" REF="60">that word, the wicked wight could no longer di&s;&s;emble and conteine his envie, but catching a Iavelin out of one of his followers hands, ranne him into the bre&s;t, and &s;o bereft my liefe and onely &s;onne of his life. Thus I poore wretch, in &s;tead of a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bridegroom <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> Spou&s;e brought away a dead Corps; and aged as I was, enter|red my be&s;t and deere&s;t beloved &s;onne, in the very flowre of his yeeres, even when the Downe of his beard began to bud forth. But the murderer, as if he had &s;laine &s;ome mortall enemie, neither &s;hewed at any time one token of repen|tance: nor yet for this wicked act of his vouch&s;afed the dead now under ground any honour at all. His father verily I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, rued my wofull ca&s;e, and openly &s;hewed that he had a fellow-feeling of my calamitie. And there|fore, had he lived &s;till, I &s;hould never have come to you for to worke him any woe. For, hee was my &s;ingular good Lord, and many favours there pa&s;&s;ed from him to me ward, and I againe was his liege man and a faithfull &s;ervitour. But, &s;eeing the Kingdome is now devolved upon the &s;layer of my &s;onne: &s;ure|ly, neither can I ever be well minded unto him, nor can he, I wore well, thinke that ever I will be his friend. For, well hee knoweth, how my heart &s;tandeth affected to him ward: and that as heretofore I lived merrily, &s;o now de&s;poyled of my &s;onne, I lead mine old age in &s;orrow and heavine&s;&s;e. If it will plea&s;e you therefore, to enterteine mee &s;o, as that I may conceive &s;ome hope by your meanes to be revenged in any mea&s;ure for my deere &s;onnes death, then &s;hall I thinke my &s;elfe to waxe young againe, and neither &s;eeme to live with di&s;ho|nour, nor to die in dolour.</P>
<P>When <HI>Gobryas</HI> had thus &s;aid, <HI>Cyrus</HI> made an&s;were in this manner. If it may appeare, my <HI>Gobryas,</HI> that you thinke in heart, as you have &s;poken with your lips: I both receive you graciou&s;ly as an humble &s;uppliant, and al&s;o promi&s;e with the helpe of God to puni&s;h the murderer accordingly. But tell me now, quoth he, In ca&s;e we doe thus much for you, and withall &s;uffer you to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;till, of your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> walled forts, your country, and your armour, yea and to hold that power and authoritie which heretofore you have held, what &s;ervice will you performe for all the&s;e favours? Who an&s;wered thus. My &s;trong holds are at your commaund: and when&s;oever it plea&s;eth you, render them up to you I will, that you may dwell therein. The tribute i&s;&s;uing out of my Lands, which I payd to him, the &s;ame will I transferre and bring unto you. When&s;o|ever you &s;hall need to make an expedition, I will goe to warfare with you, bringing with mee the forces of my country. I have be&s;ides, a daughter, a young damo&s;ell and evirgin, whom I love full deerely; and marriageable now &s;hee is. Whom heretofore I thought to cherri&s;h and bring up, to be a wife for this new King. But now, my daughter, with many teares and humbly up|on her knees be&s;ought mee, not to be&s;tow her upon the murderer of her bro|ther. And of the &s;ame minde I al&s;o am. Now therefore I give you good leave, to deliberate of her no otherwi&s;e, than I my &s;elfe would be thought to con&s;ult concerning you. Hereupon, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> In regard, quoth he, of the&s;e Capitulations, and in confirmation thereof I give here unto you, truly and from my heart my right hand, and likewi&s;e take yours againe.

<P>After the&s;e contracts pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded <HI>Gobryas</HI> to depart with his armour: and withall enquired of him how great a journey it was to the place of his abode? as minding to hold his progre&s;&s;e thither? If, quoth he, you &s;et

Secondarily, for <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> the &s;ame in kinde, but of a &s;econd &s;ort. Moreover, they &s;ped them&s;elves to the full of other commodities as they needed, to the end they might want nothing whiles they warred. For, great plentie there was of all things. The Hyrcanians likewi&s;e tooke what|&s;oever they &s;tood in need of, yea and the Me&s;&s;enger of <HI>Cyaxares</HI> they permit|ted to &s;hare equally with the re&s;t. As for tho&s;e Pavilions which remained over and above, they delivered into the hands of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> for the u&s;e and behoofe of the Per&s;ians. As touching the money in coine, they &s;aid, they would then make partage thereof when they had gathered in all. Which duly they per|formed. Well, thus they did, and thus they &s;aid. As concerning the portion &s;elected for <HI>Cyaxares, Cyrus</HI> gave order to &s;uch as he knew to be mo&s;t inward and familiar with him, for to receive and keepe the &s;ame &s;afe. Now for tho&s;e gifts, quoth hee, which yee conferre upon mee, I take them willingly. Yet, who&s;e minde &s;oever among you all &s;tands mo&s;t thereunto, hee &s;hall u&s;e the &s;ame with all my heart. Then a certeine Median, who loved Mu&s;icke ve|ry well. Truly <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, when I heard the&s;e mu&s;icall women &s;ing whom now you have, I tooke great delight in hearing them. And if you would be &s;o good as to be&s;tow one of them upon mee, I &s;hould thinke it a greater plea|&s;ure to be a &s;ouldier here in the Campe, than to tarry at home. Then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and I give her thee with all my heart: yea and I take my &s;elfe to be more beholden unto thee, for craving, than thou to me for having her of mee. So de&s;irous am I to gratifie you all. Thus he that reque&s;ted the woman, had her for his owne.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> How <HI>Ara&s;pes</HI> had the keeping of faire <HI>Panthea,</HI> on whom he became enamoured. A di&s;cour&s;e betweene <HI>Cyrus</HI> and him, whether Love were voluntary or forced?</HEAD>
<P>_CYRVS having called unto him <HI>Ara&s;pes</HI> the Median (who had beene his companion of achild, to whom al&s;o he had given from his backe at his departure from <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the rich Median robe afore&s;aid) commaunded him to take the cu&s;todie as well of the beautifull Ladie, as of the rich tent above&s;aid, to his u&s;e. Now was this Gen|tlewoman the wife of <HI>Abradatas</HI> King of Su&s;a. But what time as the A&s;&s;yrian Campe became &s;urprized, this husband of hers was not there, but gone in Emba&s;&s;age unto the King of the Bactrians, &s;ent thither from the A&s;&s;yrian Monarch to treat of an A&s;&s;ociation in warre, betweene them: For that, there was a mutuall cour&s;e of ho&s;pitalitie, betwixt him and the King of the Bactrians. This Ladie, I &s;ay, <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded <HI>Ara&s;pes</HI> to keepe &s;afe, untill he tooke her to him&s;elfe. <HI>Ara&s;pes</HI> having this charge, que&s;tioned with him a|bout her in this wi&s;e. Have you, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;eene the woman, whom you will mee to keepe? No truly, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> nor I. But I, quoth he, againe, beheld her well when I cho&s;e her for you, And verily at our comming into her tent, at fir&s;t wee knew her not from others. For, &s;hee was &s;et upon the ground, with all her waiting maids about her: and clad &s;hee was like unto them. But when upon a de&s;ire that we had, to know which was the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, and ca&s;t our eyes about, wi&s;tly avi&s;ing them all, it was &s;oone &s;eene how farre &s;hee &s;urmounted the re&s;t, &s;et though &s;hee were wimpled and veiled, yea and looking downward to the ground. But when wee willed her to ari&s;e upon her feet, and therewith all the other that were about her aro&s;e likewi&s;e, then &s;hee &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them all indeed; Fir&s;t, in tallne&s;&s;e and goodly pre&s;ence; then, in the &s;trong feature of her body, in her vertuous carriage; al&s;o in a &s;eemely grace and lovely favour, albeit &s;hee &s;tood araied in poore and &s;imple habit. We might
<PB N="104" REF="62">withall &s;ee plainly the teares partly di&s;tilling upon her mantle and upper gar|ments, and in part trickling downe to her very feet. Hereupon, when as the el|de&s;t per&s;on in our companie &s;aid unto her, Madam, bee of good cheere. For, albeit, we heare &s;ay, that you have a good by Gentleman and a valiant to your husband, yet now wote well, we chu&s;e you forth, for &s;uch a per&s;on, as neither in beautie and favour, nor in di&s;creet judgement, ne yet in pui&s;&s;ance and valour is inferiour to him: but in our conceit, if there bee any one el&s;e in the world, <HI>Cyrus</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you is the man worthy to be admired; and his from henceforth you &s;hall be. The woman when &s;hee heard this, all to rent her mantle from above, and cryed out piteou&s;ly; yea her maid-&s;ervants al&s;o with her skriked out amaine. With that, the mo&s;t part of her face was &s;eene, her necke bared, her hands and armes di&s;covered. And a&s;&s;ure your &s;elfe <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, that as well to mee, as to all the re&s;t who &s;aw her, it &s;eemed there was never yet the like woman in A&s;ia, begotten and borne of mortall parents. Therefore, you al&s;o &s;hall neither will nor chu&s;e, but &s;ee her. Not &s;o, quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> If &s;he be &s;o goodly a creature as you report, &s;o much the le&s;&s;e will I behold her. And why &s;o? Sir, &s;aid the young Gentleman. Becau&s;e, quoth he, if now upon your re|port, that &s;hee is faire and beautifull, I &s;hould be per&s;waded to goe and eye her, having no great lei&s;ure and time to &s;pare, I feare mee lea&s;t &s;hee might eft&s;oones allure me &s;ooner to come eft&s;oones for to view and review her againe, and &s;o perhaps neglecting my &s;erious and weighty affaires, which I ought to manage, I &s;hould &s;et by it, avi&s;ing and looking upon her. Why? quoth the &s;aid young Gentleman, and laughed withall. Thinke you, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that the beautie of man or woman, is &s;o powerfull, as to enforce any one again&s;t his will, to doe other|wi&s;e than for the be&s;t? For, if, &s;aid hee, it were &s;o by the cour&s;e of nature, it would force all indifferently. Behold, the fire here, quoth he, burneth all men alike, and why? becau&s;e &s;uch is the nature of it. And of beautifull women, men love &s;ome, and others they doe not. One is enamoured of this thing, and another of that. For why? love, quoth he, is a pa&s;&s;ion meere voluntary, and every man liketh what and whom he li&s;teth. Now, you &s;ee, that the brother is not in love with his &s;i&s;ter, but a &s;tranger is: Neither falleth the father in fan|cie with his owne daughter, another doth. For, feare and law, are &s;ufficient to re&s;traine love. But if a law were made, that who eate not, &s;hould not be hun|gry; who drinke not, &s;hould not be dry: Al&s;o, that no man &s;hould be a cold in Winter, nor hote in Summer: how &s;trictly &s;oever it were devi&s;ed and penned, it could not bring to pa&s;&s;e, that men in tho&s;e points would obey the &s;ame. For, by nature they are framed to yeeld thereto. But, to love, is meere voluntary. Every man, to &s;ay a truth, affecteth the things that be his owne, as his raiment, his &s;hooes, &amp;c. Then replyed <HI>Cyrus.</HI> If love be voluntary, how is it that a man cannot cea&s;&s;e to love when he will? For, I my &s;elfe have &s;eene men to weepe, for very &s;orrow occa&s;ioned by love, yea and to become bond and thrall to tho&s;e whom they loved; how-ever, before they were in love, they reputed &s;er|vitude and bondage to be very evill. Yea I have ob&s;erved them to give away many things, which without their lo&s;&s;e and hinderance they might not mi&s;&s;e: who al&s;o wi&s;hed of God for to be delivered from love, no le&s;&s;e than from &s;ome other grievous maladie, yet could not be relea&s;ed therefrom: but were bound with a &s;tronger dure&s;&s;e of nece&s;&s;itie, than if they had beene tyed with chaines of yron. Hence it is, that they yeeld them&s;elves thrall unto their Paramours,
<PB N="105" REF="62">ready even to performe many idle and fooli&s;h &s;ervices unto them: yea and being once thus encumbred and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e mi&s;eries, they never &s;o much as give the attempt to get away, but rather become Gaolers them&s;elves unto their beloved; ob&s;erving them narrowly, that they make no e&s;cape. They doe indeed thus, as you &s;ay, quoth the young Knight, poore wretches as they be. And therefore I &s;uppo&s;e being<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> in this mi&s;erable ca&s;e, they alwaies wi&s;h indeed to die; but notwith&s;tanding there bee ten thou&s;and meanes, to make them&s;elves away, yet they doe it not. And even the&s;e &s;elfe-&s;ame men al&s;o [to mainteine their lives] fall to &s;tealing, and forbeare not other mens goods: yet when any have either robbed or filched ought, &s;ee you not how your &s;elfe with the fir&s;t, (as if there were no nece&s;&s;itie of &s;uch theeving) accu&s;e the theefe and robber, neither doe you pardon but puni&s;h him? Semblably, they that be faire and beautifull, neither compell men to love them, nor to covet &s;uch things as are not to be de&s;ired: but &s;illy and fooli&s;h folke, be, I &s;uppo&s;e, in all manner of lu&s;ts and de&s;ires incontinent, and when they cannot rule their owne affecti|ons, lay all the blame afterwards upon love. Whereas, hone&s;t and wi&s;e men, although they de&s;ire gold, faire &s;teedes and beautifull women, yet can they ea|&s;ily ab&s;teine from all the&s;e, &s;o, as that they will not &s;o much as touch them wrongfully. And for mine owne part, I a&s;&s;ure you, albeit I beheld this faire Dame, and that &s;hee &s;eemed in mine eye right lovely and amiable, yet you &s;ee, how I am now with you, I ride my hor&s;e, and performe other parts of my de|voir in your &s;ervice. And &s;o you doe, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as God me love. Yet per|adventure, you came &s;ooner away from her, than is the time that love u&s;eth to en&s;nare a man. For, it may well be, that if one touch fire, he is not pre&s;ently burnt therewith; and wood &s;treight-wayes catcheth not a light fire and fla|meth out. Yet neither willingly doe I touch fire: nor with my good will looke on beautifull per&s;ons: ne yet doe I advi&s;e you &ocirc; <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> to keepe your eyes fixed long upon tho&s;e that bee faire. For that, the fire indeed burneth tho&s;e onely that touch it, but the beautifull inflame even tho&s;e al&s;o that eye them afarre off, &s;o as they burne againe in love. Be content I pray you, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For, I warrant you, looke I never &s;o long upon her, yet &s;hall I not be &s;o farre overcome as to commit any lewd and undecent part. That's very well &s;aid of you, quoth <HI>Cyrus:</HI> and therefore keepe you her as I bid you: For, perhaps, this woman may one day &s;tead us very much. Thus having communed togither they departed a&s;under.</P>
<P>But this young Gallant, partly &s;eeing her to be of incomparable beautie, and in part perceiving her vertuous deportment: as al&s;o for that hee having the charge of her, was per&s;waded that he did content her humour: Finding with|all her &s;elfe not unthankefull, as who for her part againe, was very carefull, that by the meanes and mini&s;tery of her &s;ervants, when&s;oever he came into his pa|vilion, he &s;hould have all things convenient, and if at any time he were ill at ea&s;e or &s;icki&s;h, want nothing requi&s;ite: by occa&s;ion of all the&s;e things, I &s;ay, caught he was in the &s;nares of love, and perhaps, this was no &s;trange and won|derous thing that befell unto him.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> being a&s;&s;ured of the Medes and other Allies, rode to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Gobryas.</HI> And of his Magnificence.</HEAD>
<P>BVT <HI>Cyrus</HI> being de&s;irous that both Medes, and other A&s;&s;ociates al&s;o, &s;hould bee willing to continue with him, called unto him all his men of Action, unto whom when they were come togither, he made a &s;peech to this effect. I know for certeine, that yee Medes and all here pre&s;ent, have gone forth with me, neither for want of money, nor becau&s;e yee thought in this be|halfe to doe <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;ervice: but upon a de&s;ire to doe me plea&s;ure and honour, yee have beene willing even by night to travaile and adventure with mee. In which re&s;pects, I take my &s;elfe obliged unto you, unle&s;&s;e I would bee unju&s;t. But to recompen&s;e you accordingly, and to your de&s;ert, mee thinkes I am not able as yet. And verily, &s;o to &s;ay I am not aba&s;hed: And to promi&s;e, That if yee tarry &s;till, I will requite you, wote yee may well, I am a&s;hamed. For I might &s;uppo&s;e it would be thought, I &s;o &s;pake, becau&s;e I would have you to be more willing for to &s;tay with mee. But in lieu thereof, thus much I prote&s;t unto you: That albeit yee depart upon your alleageance to <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> yet will I endevour, &s;o to carry my &s;elfe to you ward, in ca&s;e I &s;peed well, that even your &s;elves may commend and prai&s;e me. For, I am not now upon my depar|ture out of the&s;e parts. But with the Hyrcanians, unto whom I have given mine oath and right hand; I will keepe ju&s;t promi&s;e, and never will I be found to betray them. As for <HI>Gobryas,</HI> who erewhile, hath made over unto us his walled forts, his territorie and forces, I will &s;o deale with him, as he &s;hall never repent of his journey made to mee. And that which more is, &s;ince that the Gods &s;o evidently goe with us and further our enterpri&s;es, I &s;hould both &s;tand in feare of them and al&s;o be a&s;hamed, if I gave over the&s;e de&s;ignments, and de|parted incon&s;ideratly without effect. This therefore, quoth he, will I for my part performe, doe yee as yee &s;hall thinke good: but withall acquaint me with your re&s;olution. Thus &s;pake he. But the Gentleman, who &s;ometime claimed kinred of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> opined fir&s;t in this wi&s;e. As to my &s;elfe verily, thus much, &ocirc; King; for, a King you &s;eeme to be by nature no le&s;&s;e than the Ma&s;ter Bee, which in the hive is bred their Leader, as whom the Bees are willing to obey: in &s;o much as where&s;oever hee remaineth, not one of them will depart from thence: and whither&s;oever he goeth, none will tarry behind: &s;uch an ardent love is in|bred in them, to be governed by him: Semblably, are the&s;e men, I &s;ay in &s;ome &s;ort affected to you. For, when you went from us into Per&s;ia, who was there of all the Medes young or old left behind, but hee waited upon you? untill &s;uch time as King <HI>A&s;tyages</HI> called us away. Againe, after that you came out of Per&s;ia to aide us, wee might perceive incontinently your friends in manner all, as voluntaries to follow you. Moreover, when you were de&s;irous to un|dertake an expedition into the&s;e parts, all the Medes willingly attended upon you. And truly, at this pre&s;ent, thus di&s;po&s;ed we are, that &s;o long as we have your per&s;onall pre&s;ence in our enemies Land, wee dare be bold: but without you, affraied we &s;hould be to returne even into our native country. Therefore, what other men intend to doe let them &s;peake them&s;elves: but I, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> and
<PB N="107" REF="63">all tho&s;e that are under me will &s;tay with you: and &s;o long as we behold you, be re&s;olute to abide all brunts, and &s;hew our &s;elves firme and fa&s;t to you, in re|gard of tho&s;e favours and benefits which we have received at your hands. Then &s;pake <HI>Tigranes</HI> after this manner. Mervaile not &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, if I keepe &s;i|lence: For, my minde is not ready now to deliberate, but to execute what&s;o|ever you commaund. Then, the Hyrcanian Prince, I would &s;ay, quoth he, that if yee the Medes departed now, it were the will of adver&s;e fortune, and &s;ome cro&s;&s;e handiwork of God, not to permit you for to enjoy any great felici|tie. For, in the judgement of man, who would either turne backe, when his enemies flie? or when they deliver up their armes, not receive them? or when they yeeld them&s;elves and what they have, not take all? e&s;pecially, &s;eeing we have &s;uch a Captaine, as &s;eemeth, I take all the Gods to record, to delight more in doing us plea&s;ure and procuring our good, than in enriching him&s;elfe. After him all the Medes with one voice brake out into the&s;e or &s;uch like words. You, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> brought us forth, and therefore when you thinke it time to de|part, bring you us likewi&s;e home againe.</P>
<P>When <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard this uniforme accord, hee praied in this wi&s;e. Graunt I be&s;eech thee, mo&s;t mighty <HI>Iupiter,</HI> that I may exceed the&s;e in beneficence, who doe me this honour. Which &s;aid, he commaunded all the re&s;t, after they had &s;et their watch and ward, to keepe them&s;elves in their &s;everall quarters: but the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to &s;et out and di&s;tribute the tents, to the men of armes, &s;uch as were meet for hor&s;emen; to the footmen tho&s;e that were &s;ufficient for them: Al&s;o to take order, that generally throughout, as many as were within the tents, &s;hould bring all things nece&s;&s;arie unto the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> according to their &s;everall compa|nies, yea and furni&s;h them with hor&s;es well tended and dre&s;&s;ed to their hands: to the end that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> them&s;elves might have nothing el&s;e to doe, but to attend upon warlike affaires. Thus &s;pent they this day.</P>
<P>The next morning early when they were ri&s;en, they put them&s;elves in their journey toward <HI>Gobryas. Cyrus</HI> verily being mounted on hor&s;ebacke togither with the new Cavallery of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> growne now to the number of 2000. or there about. After whom followed tho&s;e who carried their targuets and ci|miters, being in number equall to them. Semblably, the re&s;t of the armie mar|ched in good array. Moreover, <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded every one of them to &s;ay unto the&s;e their new waiters and followers; that who&s;oever were &s;eene either dragging behind the leaders and keepers of the rereward, or leaping before the front of the vantgard, or taken on either &s;ide [or flanke] of the battaile with|out, divided from tho&s;e that were in their ranks, they &s;hould be grievou&s;ly pu|ni&s;hed. Thus, the next day, they were come by the evening as farre as to <HI>Go|bryas</HI> his Ca&s;tle. An exceeding &s;trong pile they &s;aw it to bee, and upon the wals, every thing planted to make re&s;i&s;tance and forcibly to repell the enemie. Furthermore, they perceived many head of oxen, and a mighty number of &s;heep driven and brought togither, under the very fortifications. Then, <HI>Gobryas</HI> &s;ent unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> willing him to ride about and view where the avenue was mo&s;t ea|&s;ie: and withall, to &s;end in unto him certaine of his tru&s;ty men, who might re|late unto him what they had &s;eene within. <HI>Cyrus</HI> therefore, de&s;irous in very deed to &s;ee whether the Ca&s;tle were any where prenable, or whether <HI>Gobryas</HI> would be found a lier, rode all about: where, he &s;aw every place &s;tronger, than to yeeld any acce&s;&s;e. As for tho&s;e whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;ent in to <HI>Gobryas,</HI> they brought
<PB N="108" REF="64">word backe againe unto him, that there was within, &s;uch &s;tore of goods, as in their judgement &s;eemed &s;ufficient to &s;erve tho&s;e therein, all a mans life. Here|upon <HI>Cyrus</HI> mu&s;ed with him&s;elfe what tho&s;e things might be. By which time <HI>Gobryas</HI> in per&s;on came forth unto him, and brought out all the per&s;ons that were within: &s;ome, laden with wine and wheat-meale; others driving before them kine and oxen, &s;wine, &s;heepe and goats: And all other victuals what&s;oe|ver, they pre&s;ented unto him: &s;o as <HI>Cyrus</HI> and his whole armie might &s;up right-well therewith. They therefore who were thereto appointed, ordered the&s;e things accordingly, yea and dre&s;&s;ed &s;upper. Then <HI>Gobryas,</HI> when all his owne men were gone forth, willed <HI>Cyrus</HI> to enter in, and that in &s;uch manner, as him|&s;elfe thought be&s;t for his owne &s;afety. So <HI>Cyrus</HI> having &s;ent before his &s;pies to di&s;cover, and a &s;trong troupe for to guard, at the la&s;t entred in per&s;on. When he was once within, and the gates kept wide open &s;till, he called unto him all his friends and chiefe Commaunders of the &s;ouldiers about him. When all were come in, <HI>Gobryas</HI> brought out wine bolles of gold, flagons, ba&s;ons and ewers, with ornaments and furniture of all &s;orts, certaine pieces al&s;o of coine called Dareiks innumerable, and all things that were faire and goodly to bee &s;eene. At the la&s;t, having pre&s;ented his daughter al&s;o, (an exceeding beautifull Damoi&s;ell &s;he was, very tall, and per&s;onable be&s;ides, clad in mourning weed for the death of her brother afore&s;aid.) Here quoth he &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> All this riches I be&s;tow upon you. And this daughter of mine likewi&s;e, I recommend to your tuition even to di&s;po&s;e of her as you thinke good: And humbly be&s;eech you, both I, as beforetime in the behalfe of my &s;onne, and &s;hee now for her bro|ther, that you will be his avenger. Hereto <HI>Cyrus</HI> an&s;wered in this wi&s;e. I pro|mi&s;ed you verily, as then, to revenge your quarrell to my power, if I found you true of your word. And now, &s;eeing you have &s;poken a truth, I am bound to performe my word and promi&s;e. To her al&s;o I make behe&s;t, with the helpe of God, to doe no le&s;&s;e. And as for this trea&s;ure quoth he, I accept thereof, and withall be&s;tow the &s;ame here, upon this your daughter, and him who&s;e hap it &s;hall be to e&s;pou&s;e her. But one gift there is be&s;ide, that I would gladly at my departure receive at your hands; which if I may obtaine, I would not more joyfully depart, if I had all the wealth either in Babylon which is much, or in the univer&s;all world, which is infinite. <HI>Gobryas</HI> mervailing what it &s;hould be, and &s;u&s;pecting he would name his daughter, asked him and &s;aid: What is that boone <HI>Cyrus</HI> which you would &s;o faine have? Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> an&s;wered, I &s;uppo&s;e my <HI>Gobryas</HI> quoth he, there be many men, who by their good wills are not im|pious to God-ward, nor injurious to men, ne yet, of them&s;elves willing &s;o much as to lie: Howbeit, becau&s;e no man would ever put into their hands great wealth, regall dominion, &s;trong ca&s;tles, and mo&s;t deerely beloved children, they die before they be knowne what they are. But you, by tendering unto me, fen&s;ed and walled forts, riches infinite of all kinds, your whole power and pui&s;|&s;ance, yea and your daughter &s;o liefe, &s;o deere, and &s;o worth the having, have made knowne to all the world that I am the man, who would neither deale vn|con&s;cionably with &s;trangers, nor doe wrong to any for love of money, nor yet willingly fal&s;ifie my promi&s;e and covenant. Be you &s;ure therefore and wote well, that &s;o long as I am a ju&s;t and righteous man, and &s;hall be for that good opinion prai&s;ed among men, I will never forget this [your kindne&s;&s;e and affi|ance in mee] but endeavour by all good and hone&s;t meanes, to honour you
<PB N="109" REF="64">againe. Neither feare you quoth he, that you &s;hall lacke a man, worthy to be an husband for your daughter. For, many friends I have and tho&s;e right ho|nourable and valiant Knights: and who&s;e hap &s;oever it is of all them to marry her, whether he &s;hall have &s;o much money and good as is given by you with her, or much more than that commeth to, I am not able to &s;ay. But this would I have you to know for certaine, that &s;ome of them there be, who in regard of the portion which you give, will not e&s;teeme you one whit the more. And ve|rily, they now imitate mee with a kind of emulation: and pray unto all the Gods, that they may have occa&s;ion one day to &s;hew that they are no le&s;&s;e loy|all and faithfull to their Friends, than I am to mine; and to their enemies, whiles they have a day to live will never yeeld, unle&s;&s;e &s;ome God cro&s;&s;e them. Now for vertue and good reputation, they would not preferre before it, all the riches of the <HI>Syrians</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> put them both togither, and &s;et the &s;ame to yours. And &s;uch men I would you well knew, are now &s;itting here. Then <HI>Gobryas</HI> laughed heartily and &s;aid. For the love of God, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;hew me where the&s;e men are, that I may beg at your hands one of them for to be my &s;onne. Care not you for that, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> neither &s;hall you need to enquire that of mee: doe but keepe us company, and you &s;hall be able your &s;elfe, to &s;hew each of them, even to another. Thus much having &s;aid: he tooke <HI>Gobryas</HI> by the right hand, and ri&s;ing withall went his waies forth, and drew out all his men with him. And albeit he was earne&s;tly importuned by <HI>Gobryas</HI> to take his &s;upper with him, yet would he not, but &s;upped in the Campe, and tooke <HI>Gobryas</HI> with him as his gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Now being &s;et upon a greene banke, he que&s;tioned with him in this manner. Tell me, my <HI>Gobryas,</HI> quoth he, Thinke you that you have more cui&s;hons and carpets than every one of us? To whom he an&s;wered, I know right well, &s;o God me love, that yee have carpets, cui&s;hons, beds, pallets and tables many more, and that your dwelling hou&s;e is farre larger and of greater receit than mine, as who for your habitations make u&s;e of the earth and skie, and have as many beds as there be couches and re&s;ting places on the ground. Be&s;ides, yee take for your carpets and cui&s;hons not &s;o many as the &s;heepe affoord fleeces of wooll, but as mountaines and fields doe yeeld bru&s;h and branch to make fagots of. And this being the fir&s;t time, that <HI>Gobryas</HI> &s;upped among them, when he &s;aw their coor&s;e and homely fare, he thought him&s;elfe kept more plentifull and liberall cheere than they. But after that he ob&s;erved their moderate feeding (for there is not a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> of good education, who with any meate or drinke is perceived openly either in his eies, to bee di&s;tempered, or by ravening and greedy eating, in his mind to have le&s;&s;e foreca&s;t, than if he were not at his meat: For, like as good hor&s;emen, for that they be not troubled on hor&s;ebacke, are able all the while they ride, to &s;ee, to heare, and to &s;ay as they ought: even &s;o, they at their meales, thinke they &s;hould appeare openly to be wi&s;e, &s;ober and temperate; &s;uppo&s;ing, that to be &s;tirred and di&s;quieted after eating and drinking, is doglike, &s;winelike and bruti&s;h.) He ob&s;erved withall in them, that they demaunded one of ano|ther &s;uch que&s;tions, as it was more plea&s;ure to aske them than not: and ca&s;t forth tho&s;e prety je&s;ts and merry conceits, which being uttered, cau&s;ed more de|light in the delivery, than otherwi&s;e kept in: and that in all their mirth, they were farre from contumelious and &s;pitefull termes, farre from doing any lewd and filthy act: farre from grieving and offending one another. But the greate&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="65">thing of all other in his opinion was this; that being in warre-&s;ervice, they thought not any of them who adventured the &s;ame perill, ought to have more allowance at the table than the re&s;t: but &s;uppo&s;ed that Fea&s;t to be be&s;t, wherein they made their confederates that were to fight with them mo&s;t valiant: Now when <HI>Gobryas</HI> aro&s;e to goe home to his owne hou&s;e, hee u&s;ed, by report, the&s;e words. I wonder now no more quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that we have more drinking cups, more garments, and gold in coyne, and yet are of le&s;&s;e account than you. For all our care and &s;tudy is who &s;hall have mo&s;t of the&s;e things: Whereas, your chiefe endeavour is as it &s;eemeth unto me, to be the be&s;t and mo&s;t valou|rous men. When <HI>Gobryas</HI> had thus &s;aid, Goe to then, quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> unto him, See that to morrow morning betimes, you &s;hew your &s;elfe here with your men of armes well appointed, to the end that as we may take a view of your forces, &s;o you may conduct us through your countrey. Whereby al&s;o we &s;hall know, what parts thereof to account friendly, and what to repute as ho&s;tile. Having thus communed togither, they tooke their leaves, and either of them went to that which was meet for them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> intended to a&s;&s;ault the great City of Babylon. The di&s;cour|&s;es which he had with the Prince of <HI>Hyrcania</HI> and with <HI>Gobryas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen morrow appeared, <HI>Gobryas</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elfe with his hor&s;|men accordingly and led the way. But <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as became a Gene|rall and chiefe Commaunder, did not onely &s;et his mind upon his journey, but al&s;o as hee pa&s;&s;ed on, ca&s;t with him&s;elfe, how po&s;&s;ibly hee might weaken his enemies, and make his owne &s;ide &s;tronger. Whereupon, &s;ending for the <HI>Hyrcanian</HI> Prince and <HI>Gobryas,</HI> (for he &s;uppo&s;ed them to have mo&s;t skill in tho&s;e points which he was to know) I thinke, quoth he my good friends, that I &s;hall not doe ami&s;&s;e to conferre with you that are tru&s;ty confederates, as tou|ching this warre. For I &s;ee, that it concerneth you much more than mee, that the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King get not the upper hand of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> us. For my &s;elfe, if I &s;hould take the foile and loo&s;e this that I have gotten, I might haply find &s;ome other place of refuge: but in ca&s;e hee win and get the day, I &s;ee your whole e&s;tate will bee alienated from you and become other mens. Mine enemie he is, not becau&s;e he hateth me, but for that he &s;uppo&s;eth it will be his lo&s;&s;e if we be great, which is the onely rea&s;on why he warreth upon us. But you, he not onely hateth and that mortally, but taketh him&s;elfe al&s;o to be wronged by you. To this both of them an&s;wered. That as they had a care to performe the exploit, as who knew as much as he told them, &s;o they were exceeding &s;ollicitous withall, about the future i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent enterpri&s;e. Whereupon, thus began he fir&s;t with them. Tell me, quoth he. Thinks the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King, that yee alone carry ho|&s;tile hearts again&s;t him, or know yee, that he hath &s;ome other enemies be&s;ides? Yes verily quoth the <HI>Hyrcanian</HI> Prince: His greate&s;t enemies be the <HI>Cadu&s;ij:</HI> a nation very populous and mighty. The <HI>Sacans</HI> al&s;o our borderers, who have &s;u&s;tained much harme from the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> King. For, he hath attempted to &s;ub|due them as well as us. Thinke yee not then, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that both of them now,
<PB N="111" REF="65">would gladly take our parts, and be ready with us joyntly to invade the <HI>A&s;&s;y|rians?</HI> Yes, and that right fiercely &s;aid they, if by any meanes they might joyne with us. And what is the let betweene, quoth hee, that wee may not combine and be united togither? Even the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> them&s;elves, &s;ay they, that very na|tion through which you goe at this time. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard this. What now? my <HI>Gobryas:</HI> and accu&s;e you not this young Prince newly come to the Crowne, as one who in his deportment is very proud and in&s;olent? Yes verily quoth <HI>Go|bryas,</HI> for I found him &s;o. But hath he carried him&s;elfe in that &s;ort, replyed <HI>Cy|rus,</HI> to you onely, or to &s;ome be&s;ides? So helpe mee <HI>Iupiter</HI> quoth <HI>Gobryas,</HI> to many others likewi&s;e. But of his outrages committed upon feeble per&s;ons, what need I to relate? For, a much greater Potentates &s;onne then I am, and one verily who was his companion as mine had beene, whiles he dranke and made merry with him, he laid hands upon and guelded him: becau&s;e as &s;ome have gi|ven out, a Concubine of his had prai&s;ed him for his beauty and goodly per&s;o|nage, in &s;aying that the woman were right happy, who might be his wife: but, as him&s;elf now &s;aith, for that he would have forced the &s;aid Concubine. And now is he become indeed an Eunuch. But &s;ince his fathers death enjoyeth his Seig|norie and Dominion. How then quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> thereupon, thinke you, that this young Gentleman al&s;o would gladly &s;ee us, if he might be per&s;waded that wee would aide and a&s;&s;i&s;t him? Yes, that he would, I dare be bold to &s;ay, quoth <HI>Go|bryas.</HI> But to have a &s;ight of him, my good friend <HI>Cyrus,</HI> it is an hard matter. And why &s;o? &s;aith <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Becau&s;e quoth <HI>Gobryas,</HI> he that will joyne with him, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity pa&s;&s;e hard by Babylon: And what difficulty lyeth in that? &s;aid <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For that, I a&s;&s;ure you, upon my knowledge, there hath i&s;&s;ued out of that City a more pui&s;&s;ant armie by farre, than that which you have in field at this pre&s;ent. Moreover, this you are to know, that for this very cau&s;e the <HI>A&s;&s;y|rians</HI> furni&s;h you le&s;&s;e with armour now, and bring unto you fewer hor&s;es, than they did at fir&s;t: Becau&s;e your forces &s;eemed unto them that viewed the &s;ame but &s;mall: and this rumour is already very much &s;pred abroad. And therefore in mine opinion better it were, that wee march warily and well guarded.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> having heard <HI>Gobryas</HI> deliver &s;uch &s;peeches, made an&s;wer in this man|ner. I approove very well &ocirc; <HI>Gobryas</HI> of this, that you advi&s;e us to &s;tand upon our guard, and to make our journeyes mo&s;t &s;afely. And con&s;idering the bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e well, I cannot thinke in my mind of any &s;urer way than to pa&s;&s;e on, direct|ly unto Babylon, if &s;o be our enemies forces be there mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant. For, many they be in number as your &s;elfe confe&s;&s;e. Now, if they &s;hall take heart, and be confident withall, they will upon my word, bee terrible al&s;o unto us. In ca&s;e therefore they &s;hall have no &s;ight at all of us, but thinke that wee keepe clo&s;e and un&s;eene, as if we &s;tood in feare of them, know a&s;&s;uredly quoth he, that they will be delivered of the feare which they have conceived, and in &s;tead thereof gather more boldne&s;&s;e, the longer it be that they &s;ee us not. But if wee march now &s;traight again&s;t them, wee &s;hall find many of them weeping and wailing &s;till for tho&s;e whom we have &s;laine: many having yet their wounds bound up, which they received from us; and all of them carrying the fre&s;h remembrances of the late manhood and valour of this our armie, togither with the wofull flight and di&s;a&s;terous calamity of their owne. You are be&s;ides &ocirc; <HI>Gobryas</HI> to take knowledge of this, what an ordinary thing it is in mo&s;t men, when they are
<PB N="112" REF="66">confident and re&s;olute, to carry an hautie and invincible minde. Let them be affrayd once, the more they are in number, the greater will their affright and amazedne&s;&s;e be. For, by many rumours and tho&s;e evill, it is in them augmen|ted: upon many adver&s;e occurrents al&s;o: by occa&s;ion likewi&s;e of many heavy down-lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">s and a&s;tonied countenances, it gathereth &s;till and groweth more and more. In &s;o much as, for the greatne&s;&s;e thereof it is no ea&s;ie matter to ex|tingui&s;h it with comfortable words, or by leading again&s;t the enemies to put heart and &s;trength againe, or yet by drawing them away, to recover in them any good conceit of them&s;elves. But the more that a man exhorteth them to re&s;olution, the greater perils they thinke they are plunged into. Let us there|fore take throughly into con&s;ideration this point. For, if in the que&s;tion of warre and martiall exploits, we mea&s;ure victories by this, whether &s;ide can le|vie and number more men, good cau&s;e you have then, to be afraid on our be|halfe, and we in very truth are in great jeopardie: but if, as heretofore, &s;o now al&s;o, battailes are tried and determined by the valour of tho&s;e that fight man|fully, you cannot doe ami&s;&s;e, if you be bold and confident. For, you &s;hall finde with the helpe of God, many more with us and in our Campe willing to fight, than among them. And that you may yet take more courage unto you, con&s;ider this al&s;o with your &s;elfe. The enemies are at this pre&s;ent, in number le&s;&s;e by farre, than before they were di&s;comfited by us: yea and fewer &s;till than what time they fled away from us. As for us, greater we are now than hereto|fore, by rea&s;on that we have wonne a victorie: more pui&s;&s;ant al&s;o and &s;trong, in regard of our good fortune, and withall more in number, by your comming unto us. And doe not you henceforth detract from the honour of your owne men, now that they be with us. For where Conquerours be, wote well <HI>Gobryas,</HI> that even the very Lackeys and Pages in the traine that hang on, follow boldly. Neither be you ignorant of this, that well may our enemies take a view of us now: but know for a truth, that no way can we terrifie them more than in our march again&s;t them. Sithens then my opinion is thus delivered, lead us forth directly to Babylon.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> challenged the King of Babylon to come into the field: and then making a league with <HI>Gadatas,</HI> wonne the fortre&s;&s;es of the Frontiers, and augmented his forces with a number of fortie thou&s;and. And how the King of A&s;&s;yria would have &s;urprized and taken in the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Gadatas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THvs they &s;et forward, and by the fourth day reached as farre as to the utmo&s;t marches of <HI>Gadatas</HI> his country. But &s;o &s;oone as <HI>Cyrus</HI> was en|tred within the enemies land, he ordeined to have in battaile ray about his owne per&s;on, both of foot and hor&s;e as many as he thought &s;ufficient. The re&s;idue of the hor&s;emen, he permitted to make rodes, and to raunge abroad, charging them to kill whom&s;oever they found in armes: but all the re&s;t, togi|ther with the cattell that they tooke, to bring unto him alive. The Per&s;ians with the re&s;t he commaunded to harry and over-runne the country. Many of them came backe againe, &s;uch as had tumbled downe from their hor&s;es and
<PB N="113" REF="66">were falne: and many brought away rich booties with them. Now when the whole pillage was before him: he a&s;&s;embled all the Chieftaines of the Medes and Hyrcanians, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Peeres afore&s;aid.</NOTE> Homotims likewi&s;e of Per&s;ia, unto whom he made this &s;peech. <HI>Gobryas,</HI> my good friends, hath heretofore entertained us all, with ma|ny gifts of ho&s;pitalitie. If now therefore, after wee have &s;elected (as the man|ner is) a due proportion for the Gods, and &s;et by for the re&s;t of the armie a competent part, wee be&s;tow upon him the remnant of the &s;poiles, wee &s;hall doe pa&s;&s;ing well: &s;hewing our &s;elves &s;traightwayes to endevour for to &s;ur|mount tho&s;e in courte&s;ies who de&s;erve &s;o well at our hands. No &s;ooner heard they this, but they all approoved yea and commended the motion: but one a|bove the re&s;t added moreover and &s;aid. Wee mu&s;t in any ca&s;e &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;o doe. For, thus <HI>Gabryas,</HI> as I take it, reputed us no better than beggers, becau&s;e wee came not with our proofes full of Daricke pur&s;es, nor dranke in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Goblets, or bottles.</NOTE> cups of gold. But if we thus doe, he wil perhaps acknowledge, that we may be liberall with|out gold. Goe to therefore &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when yee have delivered up unto the Prie&s;ts the <HI>Deo-dands,</HI> and &s;et a&s;ide as much as may &s;uffice the armie, &s;end for <HI>Gobryas,</HI> and let him have the re&s;idue. So after they had taken all that was meet and nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;urplu&s;age they gave unto <HI>Gobryas.</HI></P>
<P>This done, <HI>Cyrus</HI> marched again&s;t the very Citie of Babylon, with his armie arraunged in order of battaile, like as when the field was fought. Now when the A&s;&s;yrians i&s;&s;ued not forth again&s;t him, <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded <HI>Gobryas</HI> to ride on, and in his name to &s;ummon the King, &s;aying, That if he would come out in per&s;on and fight for his country, him&s;elfe would combat with him: but in ca&s;e he would not defend his country, then of nece&s;&s;itie he mu&s;t give place and &s;ubmit unto the winners. So <HI>Gobryas</HI> rode &s;o farre as hee might with &s;afetie, and delivered the &s;aid Challenge. Vnto whom the King &s;ent out one to returne his an&s;were in the&s;e words. Thy Lord and Ma&s;ter, <HI>(Gobryas)</HI> &s;aith, I repent mee not that I have &s;laine thy &s;onne, but becau&s;e I killed not thee al&s;o with him. If yee are minded to fight, come thirtie dayes hence: For, now we have no lei&s;ure, and cannot intend it, being as yet but in preparation for a battaile. Vnto whom <HI>Gobryas</HI> &s;aid, God graunt that this repentance of yours may never have end. For, evident it is, that ever &s;ince it came upon you thus to repent, I am become a pricke in your &s;ides. Then <HI>Gobryas</HI> related the an&s;were of the A&s;&s;yrian King unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> which &s;o &s;oone as he heard, he rai&s;ed his Camp and withdrew the Armie. And calling <HI>Gobryas</HI> unto him. Tell mee, quoth he, Said you not erewhile, that he whom the A&s;&s;yrian [King] did evirate, would as you thought willingly &s;ide with us? Me thinks, &s;aid he, I dare warrant that he will. For many times hee and I have freely communed togither. When therefore you thinke it good, goe unto the man: but fir&s;t handle the matter &s;o as that yee may &s;ound him and know what he &s;aith. And after you have fami|liarly talked with him, if you perceive him willing to friend us, devi&s;e what you can that he be not knowne to be our friend. For, in warre, neither can a man by any meanes more plea&s;ure his friends than if he &s;eeme to be their ene|mie, nor endamage and hurt his enemies more any way, than if he make &s;hew to be their friend. Certes, I know, quoth <HI>Gobryas,</HI> that <HI>Gadatas</HI> would give a great deale, to worke this King of A&s;&s;yria &s;ome mi&s;chiefe, but it behooveth us to con&s;ider what he is able to doe? Tell mee then, quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Thinke you that the Captaine of the Fortre&s;&s;e &s;ituate in the Frontiers of this country, which
<PB N="114" REF="67">yee &s;ay was built again&s;t the Hyrcanians and Sacans, to be a bulwarke in time of warre, for to defend the&s;e parts, will admit into it this Eunuch when hee commeth with his power? Yes verily, quoth <HI>Gobryas,</HI> if he come unto him un&s;u&s;pected, as now he is. And farthe&s;t from all &s;u&s;picion, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> hee &s;hould be, if I be&s;iege and a&s;&s;ault his holds as if I were de&s;irous to winne them, and he againe make re&s;i&s;tance and defend them with all his might: If I al&s;o for my part take &s;omewhat of his, and he againe for it, intercept as much of ours: if he catch I &s;ay &s;ome others of our men, or el&s;e the very me&s;&s;engers whom I &s;end unto tho&s;e that yee &s;ay are enemies unto the A&s;&s;yrian King: Al&s;o, if &s;uch as chaunce to be taken pri&s;oners, give out and &s;ay, they are going to the armie and bringing ladders for to skale the fore&s;aid Ca&s;tle walles. Againe, if the Eunuch, as hearing thereof, make &s;emblance, that hee is come to him with all &s;peed, for to give intelligence aforehand of the&s;e occurrents. Surely, quoth <HI>Gobryas,</HI> I know very well, that if matters be thus carried, he will be ready to receive him, yea and intreat him to &s;tay with him untill you be departed. And &s;o, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> being entred once into the Fort, he will be able ea&s;ily to make us Ma&s;ters thereof. It cannot otherwi&s;e bee by all likelyhood, &s;aith <HI>Gobryas,</HI> whiles hee within practi&s;eth and helpeth what he can, and you without more hotely give the a&s;&s;ault: Goe your waies then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and doe your ende|vour, after you have acquainted the Eunuch with this plot, and di&s;patched e|very thing accordingly, to be here pre&s;t and ready with mee. As for pledges of a&s;&s;urance, you &s;hall neither promi&s;e nor &s;hew unto him greater, than tho&s;e which you have received from us. Hereupon <HI>Gobryas</HI> departed; whom the Eunuch was glad to &s;ee: and &s;o they covenanted and agreed in all points that were meet and requi&s;ite. Now when <HI>Gobryas</HI> had related unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that hee thought all was well and &s;ure enough on the Eunuches part, for the execution of the&s;e de&s;ignments of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the very morrow after he gave an a&s;&s;ault, and <HI>Gadatas</HI> with&s;tood him and defended the Peece. The Fort which <HI>Cyrus</HI> tooke, was the &s;ame that <HI>Gadatas</HI> had given order to be a&s;&s;aulted. As for the me&s;&s;engers whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> di&s;patched before with in&s;tructions whither to goe, <HI>Gadatas</HI> &s;uffe|red &s;ome of them to get away and e&s;cape, to the end they might bring the for|ces forward and fetch skaling ladders: but &s;uch as he tooke, he examined by torture in the pre&s;ence of many. And when hee heard by their confe&s;&s;ion, whereabout they went, hee addre&s;&s;ed him immediately that very night to his journey, as if he would reveale the &s;ame. Finally, hee menaged the matter &s;o, as that his words were credited: and &s;o hee entreth the Ca&s;tle as a friend, and one that would doe his devoyr to aide him. And verily, for the while, he joy|ned with the Captaine of the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, in making preparations all that hee could for the defen&s;e thereof. But when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was come, <HI>Gadatas</HI> with the helpe of tho&s;e captives in <HI>Cyrus</HI> his armie, &s;eized the Ca&s;tle into his owne hands. Which done, pre&s;ently this <HI>Gadatas</HI> the Eunuch, having &s;ettled all things in order within, came forth unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and doing his obei&s;ance reverently, as the gui&s;e is, &s;aluted him in this manner. Welcome <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as I may &s;ay, God &s;ave you and give you joy. And even &s;o he doth truly, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus</HI> again. For, you with the helpe of God doe not onely bid mee, but compell me al&s;o to rejoyce. And I would have you to know for certeine, I am not a little proud, that I may leave this fortre&s;&s;e to our A&s;&s;ociates here, in termes of friend&s;hip: As for your &s;elfe <HI>Gadatas,</HI> the A&s;&s;yrian King hath di&s;abled for getting children, howbeit not
<PB N="115" REF="67">bereft you of &s;trength to get friends. For, per&s;wade your &s;elfe thus much, that by this deed of yours, you have made us &s;o fa&s;t friends unto you, as that wee will endevour what wee may to &s;tand to you as helpers and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, no le&s;&s;e than if you had naturall children and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, children, chil|dren, as we &s;ay unproperly, Grand-childre~.</NOTE> nephewes of your owne. Thus &s;aid <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Whereupon the Hyrcanian Prince, who even now and not before un|der&s;tood what was done, ranne unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and taking him by the right hand, &s;aid: O noble <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the exceeding joy and comfort of your friends, how much bound in thankfulne&s;&s;e by your meanes am I to the Gods, for that they have joyned mee in alliance to you? Goe you therefore, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Ca&s;tle, for which you love mee &s;o affectionately: yea and di&s;po&s;e of it &s;o, as it may bee be&s;t worth and mo&s;t acceptable to a friend of ours, to the re&s;t of our confederates, and above all to this <HI>Gadatas,</HI> who hath wonne it and delivered it into our hands. But heare you Sir, quoth the Hyrca|nian Prince, Shall we when as the Cadu&s;ians, Sacans and my &s;ubjects are met, call him al&s;o unto us, that wee may all, unto whom it apperteineth, lay our heads togither and con&s;ult, how to our be&s;t behoofe and benefit we may hold this fort? Hereto <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o gave his a&s;&s;ent. When they were met, whom the charge of the Ca&s;tle concerned, they agreed in this, that they &s;hould joyntly have the keeping of it, unto whom it was commodious for to be a peaceable and friendly neighbour; to the end it might be, as, a warlike and defen&s;ive for|tre&s;&s;e for them&s;elves, &s;o a &s;trong skants and offen&s;ive to the A&s;&s;yrians.</P>
<P>When this was done, the Cadu&s;ians, Sacans and Hyrcanians were much for|warder in the &s;ervice of warre, and came up unto him with their forces more cheerefully. And hereupon there a&s;&s;embled a power of the Cadu&s;ians to the number of twentie thou&s;and light Targuatiers on foot, and foure thou&s;and hor&s;emen. Of Sacans ten thou&s;and Archers on foot: and Carbires [or Ar|chers on hor&s;ebacke] two thou&s;and. The Hyrcanians al&s;o &s;ent unto tho&s;e that were there before, an addition of as many footmen as they could make; be&s;ide a &s;upply of two thou&s;and hor&s;emen. For, beforetime they had left the greater part of their Cavallery at home, becau&s;e the Cadu&s;ians and Sacans mainteined ho&s;tilitie with the A&s;&s;yrians. But, all the time that <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ate here about &s;ettling the e&s;tate of the Ca&s;tle; the A&s;&s;yrians inhabiting neere to tho&s;e parts, many of them led away their hor&s;es thither; many brought and put into his hands their armour; For that by this time they &s;tood in feare of all their bordering neighbours.</P>
<P>After this, came <HI>Gadatas</HI> unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> adverti&s;ing him of certeine me&s;&s;engers, who reported, how the A&s;&s;yrian King, when he heard in what termes the &s;aid &s;trong Ca&s;tle &s;tood, tooke it to the heart, and withall made preparation to in|vade his country. And therefore, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, if you will let me goe, I will doe my be&s;t to &s;ave my forts yet. As for other things I pa&s;&s;e the le&s;&s;e. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Say you &s;hould at this pre&s;ent depart, when will you be at home? Sure|ly, quoth <HI>Gadatas,</HI> by the third day I &s;hall be able to &s;uppe in mine owne land. Why! doe you thinke &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that you &s;hall finde the A&s;&s;yrian King there already? Yea verily, quoth he, I know I &s;hall; For, the farther you &s;eeme to have marched forward, the more ha&s;t will he make. By what time, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> might I reach thither with my forces? Whereunto <HI>Gadatas</HI> made this an&s;wer. You have now my Lord, a great army already, neither can you get unto my habitation in le&s;&s;e than &s;ixe or &s;even dayes. Well, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Hie you thither.
<PB N="116" REF="68">Make you what &s;peed you can for your part: I &s;hall rid way and follow after, as well as I may. So <HI>Gadatas</HI> tooke his leave and departed. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> cal|ling togither all the Rulers and Chieftaines of his confederates, who &s;eemed by this time in number to be many, and tho&s;e right hardy and martiall men, in their A&s;&s;embly made a &s;peech to this effect.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> exhorted his &s;ouldiers, to give all the booty unto <HI>Gadatas:</HI> how hee raunged his battailes, as well to fight, as to march by night.</HEAD>
<P>MY Friends and Allies, <HI>Gadatas</HI> hath done &s;uch &s;ervice, as &s;eemed unto us all worthy of good e&s;teeme: and that, before hee ever had received any boone at our hands. And now, there is newes come, that the <HI>A&s;&s;y|rian</HI> King invadeth his borders: Who, no doubt, at once will be throughly re|venged, becau&s;e he thinkes he hath &s;u&s;tained much damage by him: and haply ca&s;teth withall thus in his mind, that if tho&s;e who revolt unto us &s;hall not be di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but contrariwi&s;e his confederates be by us utterly de&s;troyed, within a little while, in all probability, there will not one abide with him. Now there|fore, I thinke my friends, we &s;hall doe a noble Act, if with alacrity we aide <HI>Ga|datas,</HI> a man &s;o friendly unto us and beneficiall. We &s;hall be&s;ides performe a deed of Iu&s;tice in thankfull requitall of a good turne; and therewith in my con|ceit worke a feat commodious for our &s;elves. For, if it &s;hall appeare in the eyes of the world, that we aime at nothing more, than to exceed them in hurt doing that annoy us, as al&s;o excell tho&s;e in good doing who de&s;erve well of us: great rea&s;on there is, that by this meanes many will &s;eeke unto us gladly for our friend&s;hip, and more de&s;ire to be enemie unto us. But if we be thought to neg|lect <HI>Gadatas,</HI> with what eloquence I pray you, (before God I &s;peake it) &s;hall we per&s;wade others to gratifie us? How dare we prai&s;e and commend our &s;elves? or with what face may any one of us looke upon <HI>Gadatas?</HI> if wee &s;o many in number be overcome in well doing of him who is but one, e&s;pecially being in that ca&s;e as he is.</P>
<P>When he had thus &s;aid they all approved his &s;peech and accorded, to goe in hand with the&s;e projects and to performe them thoroughly. Goe to then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;ince yee al&s;o give your a&s;&s;ent, let us every one leave with our draught bea&s;ts, with our wagons and chariots, &s;uch as are mo&s;t meete to goe with the &s;ame: And let <HI>Gobryas</HI> be Captaine of the convoy, and goe before them. For, skilfull he is in the waies, and for all other occa&s;ions &s;ufficient. As for our &s;elves, with the very be&s;t hor&s;e and men that we have &s;et we forward, taking with us victuals to &s;erve for three daies. The lighter we be now loden, and the &s;lighter provided, the more plea&s;antly &s;hall we dine, &s;up, and &s;leepe the dayes en&s;uing. Now, for the order and manner of our march, let it be thus. Fir&s;t and formo&s;t, you <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> lead tho&s;e that be armed with cor&s;elets, for as much as the way is even and broad. Place all your Centiniers in the Front: and let every hundred march &s;everally by them&s;elves. For going thus thicke and clo&s;e togither, wee &s;hall rid ground mo&s;t &s;peedily, and travaile with greate&s;t &s;ecurity. The rea&s;on wherefore I will and commaund tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Cor&s;ele|tiers.</NOTE> Cuirace men to goe before is, becau&s;e
<PB N="117" REF="68">they are the heavie&s;t part of the armie and mo&s;t charged: who leading thus the way, it mu&s;t needs be that the re&s;t will &s;ooner follow and more ea&s;ily, that are more lightly armed. Contrariwi&s;e, if in the night &s;ea&s;on the nimble&s;t and &s;wif|te&s;t part &s;hould march formo&s;t: no marvaile is it, if the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, batailons.</NOTE> regiments bee di&s;tra|cted: For, &s;o, that which is in the vaward, quickly outgoeth the re&s;t, and getteth out of &s;ight. Next after the&s;e, let <HI>Artabazus</HI> conduct the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Targuatiers and Archers. After them, <HI>Andramias</HI> the <HI>Mede</HI> &s;hall have the leading of the <HI>Median</HI> Infantery, and <HI>Embas</HI> next to them of the <HI>Armenian.</HI> Then let <HI>Artuchas</HI> follow with the commaund of the <HI>Hyrcanians.</HI> After whom, <HI>Thambradas</HI> with the <HI>Sacan</HI> footmen, and at the tayle of them <HI>Damatas</HI> with the <HI>Cadu&s;ians.</HI> But lead they all their regiments in this order, namely having the Centurions af|front, the Targuatiers on the right hand, the Archers on the left of their owne &s;ide. For, marching in this manner, they are the readier to execute any piece of &s;ervice. Behind the&s;e, quoth hee, &s;hall the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Souldiers, or, pages. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> porters follow with all their bag|gage: Who&s;e Provo&s;ts mu&s;t looke unto them all, that in the evening they bring togither every thing in good order before they &s;leepe: as al&s;o that early in the morning, they be with their carriages ready, appointed in due place and follow decently. Next to the&s;e, <HI>Madatas</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> is to lead the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Cavallery: Who al&s;o &s;hall have the Centurions of the hor&s;emen in the front: and let every &s;uch Centurion lead his troupe &s;ingle, by it &s;elfe, like as the Captaines of the footmen doe. After whom let <HI>Rhambacas</HI> the <HI>Mede</HI> march with his men of Armes likewi&s;e; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d then you <HI>Tigranes</HI> with your owne Cavallery. And &s;o forth, for the Confederates; let all the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Guiders.</NOTE> Captaines of hor&s;emen conduct tho&s;e, with whom every one came unto us. The <HI>Cadu&s;ians,</HI> as they came la&s;t, &s;o let them march in the Reare hinmo&s;t. And you that are their Commaunder, take the charge now of all them that are behind, and permit not any one to follow after your hor&s;emen.

For, by night, every thing mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, both be perceived and al&s;o wrought, by helpe of eares rather than of eyes. And put ca&s;e that any trouble and di&s;order ari&s;e in the night &s;ea&s;on, it is much greater, and the &s;ame harder to be compo&s;ed than in the day time. And therefore, both &s;ilence is needfull to be kept, and order al&s;o as po&s;&s;ibly to bee ob&s;erved. Now, for the night watches quoth he, (&s;o often as ye are to ari&s;e in the night) they mu&s;t be alwaies appointed very &s;hort, and as many as may be: For feare that any man by occa&s;ion of long wanting &s;leepe in his watch, be enforced to take hurt in his march.

<P>After this, they retired to their Pavilions, di&s;cour&s;ing as they went one with another in this &s;ort. What a &s;ingular memorie hath <HI>Cyrus?</HI> How many hath he given directions unto? How hath he charged and commaunded them by name? And, in truth, <HI>Cyrus</HI> attained unto this by his indu&s;try and diligence. For, he thought it a great wonder, That whereas ba&s;e artificers and mechanicall Arti|&s;aries, know every one the &s;everall names of the tooles belonging to their Art, and the Phy&s;ician likewi&s;e the termes of all the in&s;truments, drugs and medi|cines
<PB N="118" REF="69">which hee u&s;eth; the Generall I &s;ay of an armie, &s;hould bee &s;o &s;tupid and blocki&s;h, as not to know the inferiour Captaines names under him, whom hee mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily u&s;e as in&s;truments when hee is minded either to &s;urpri&s;e any thing by way of prevention or to hold the &s;ame: when he intendeth I &s;ay either to encourage or to put in feare. Moreover if at any time a Generall be di&s;po&s;ed to grace and honour one, he thought it &s;eemely and decent to call the party by name. Furthermore, of this opinion he was, that they who thought their Prince tooke knowledge of them, were both de&s;irous to be &s;eene above the re&s;t ex|ploiting &s;ome brave &s;ervice, and al&s;o readier than others to forbeare commit|ting any lewd and un&s;eemely act: This al&s;o he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a fooli&s;h and ab|&s;urd fa&s;hion, that when a Lord Generall would have a thing to be done in the Armie, he &s;hould give order therefore, as &s;ome ma&s;ters in their hou&s;es u&s;e to commaund, namely in this manner, Let one goe for water, Some body cleave wood, &amp;c. For, when they bid in this wi&s;e, he thought they would all look and &s;tare one upon another, and none goe about that which is commaunded: all are in fault alike: yet is there not one a&s;hamed of his fault or once affraid: becau&s;e it is common to him with many other. In the&s;e regards, when&s;oever hee com|maunded ought to be done, he called unto them all by name. And thus much as touching the di&s;creet judgement of <HI>Cyrus</HI> in the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>The Souldiers then, for that time, when they had &s;upped, appointed &s;enti|nels, and brought togither all things needfull, went to bed. And at midnight he gave the &s;ignall [to di&s;lodge] by &s;ound of home. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> after he had &s;aid unto <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> that he &s;hould give attendance in the very way, before the va|ward of the armie, taking his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sarjeants.</NOTE> officers [and guard] about him, went forth. Within a while, <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> with the Cuirace men in his conduct. Whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> when he had given him guides of the way, commaunded to march faire and &s;oftly, untill a me&s;&s;enger came unto him; For as yet all the armie was not on foote. Him&s;elfe &s;tanding &s;till in the &s;ame place, looke whom he &s;aw comming toward him, he did put forward orderly in his ranke, but unto him that lagged behind he &s;ent to call him on. Now when they were all upon the way, he di&s;|patched certaine hor&s;emen unto <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> to tell him, how they all now had put them&s;elves in their journey, and therefore willed him to mend his pace and lead on fa&s;ter. Him&s;elfe in per&s;on, mounted on hor&s;ebacke rode gently to the Front of the armie and beheld the companies in ranke: and whom&s;oever he &s;aw marching in good order and with &s;ilence, to them he would ride clo&s;e, and aske who they were? and when he once knew, prai&s;e them he would: but if he per|ceived any to be tumultuous and di&s;orderly, after the cau&s;e thereof knowne, he would labour to appea&s;e the mi&s;rule. One thing there remaineth yet, as touch|ing the diligence and care which he &s;hewed in the night march: namely that he &s;ent forth before the whole armie certaine footmen lightly appointed, and tho&s;e not many in number: who being both &s;eene of <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> and al&s;o &s;eeing him, &s;hould as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or priuy E&s;|couts.</NOTE> Otacu&s;ts li&s;ten and adverti&s;e him of all occurrents, occa&s;ions and opportunities pre&s;ented. And one there was over the&s;e Avantcurriers, to rule and order them: and what&s;oever was ought worth and materiall, he would give notice thereof: and what was not, hee troubled him not with &s;hewing the &s;ame. And thus verily, marched he by night. But when the day was come, cer|taine of the <HI>Cadu&s;ian</HI> hor&s;emen, hee left with their Infantery marching as they did hinmo&s;t, for that they &s;hould not goe naked and de&s;titute of men of

<P>NOVV it happened, that a certeine great per&s;on one of <HI>Gadatas</HI> his men of armes, con&s;idering how his Lord and Ma&s;ter was revolted from the A&s;&s;yrian King, thought this with him&s;elfe, that if ought but well &s;hould come unto <HI>Gadatas,</HI> hee might obteine at the Kings hand the &s;eizure of all his goods and lands. Vpon which project of his, hee &s;ends one of his tru&s;ty &s;er|vants unto the &s;aid A&s;&s;yrian King with the&s;e in&s;tructions: That in ca&s;e he found the A&s;&s;yrian forces already in <HI>Gadatas</HI> his country, hee &s;hould give the King to under&s;tand, that if he lay in ambu&s;hment, hee might take both <HI>Gadatas</HI> him&s;elfe and all his companie: willing him withall to &s;ignifie what power <HI>Gadatas</HI> had in his conduct? likewi&s;e that <HI>Cyrus</HI> accompanied him not; as al&s;o, to &s;hew which way he would come. Moreover, to the end he might be the better be|leeved, he charged his owne &s;ervants, to deliver up the Ca&s;tle which him&s;elfe held within the territorie of <HI>Gadatas,</HI> with all that was therein, into the hands of the King of A&s;&s;yria. Furthermore, he promi&s;ed that after he had &s;laine <HI>Gadatas,</HI> he would come to him in per&s;on if hee could: if not, yet would hee from that time forward take the Kings part. The me&s;&s;enger appointed for this errand rode po&s;t, and with great &s;peed came unto the A&s;&s;yrian King, and declared unto the King the cau&s;e of his comming, which when he heard, he pre&s;ently entred upon the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, and with a great power of hor&s;emen, and a number of chariots, laid wait in the villages &s;tanding thicke thereabout. <HI>Gadatas</HI> when he drew neere to tho&s;e villages, &s;ent forth certeine in e&s;piall to cleere the coa&s;ts. The A&s;&s;yrian King having intelligence that the&s;e e&s;pies were comming, com|maunded two or three of the chariots and &s;ome few hor&s;emen to give ground and flie, making &s;emblance as if they were affrighted, and but few in number. Which when tho&s;e foreriders perceived, they not onely them&s;elves followed in pur&s;uit, but al&s;o gave the Al-arme to <HI>Gadatas.</HI> Who being deceived there|by, made after and followed amaine. The A&s;&s;yrians then, for that they thought <HI>Gadatas</HI> at the point to be taken, aro&s;e &s;treight out of their embu&s;hment. <HI>Ga|datas</HI> with his companies &s;eeing that, fled, as good cau&s;e they had: The other|&s;ide againe with as great rea&s;on pur&s;ued them. At which very time, that trai|terous
<PB N="120" REF="70">villaine who had plotted to forelay <HI>Gadatas,</HI> &s;trake him: and failed in deed of giving him a deadly blow, but &s;mote him in the &s;houlder and &s;o woun|ded him. Which deed done, he went his wayes to joyne with tho&s;e that fol|lowed in chace. For, being knowne who he was, hee togither with the A&s;&s;yri|ans put &s;purres to his hor&s;e, and helped the King in his pur&s;uit. Then and there, be you &s;ure, they that rode upon the heavie&s;t and &s;lowe&s;t jades, were taken by tho&s;e who had the &s;wifte&s;t &s;teeds under them. And verily <HI>Gadatas</HI> his hor&s;e|men being all &s;ore overlayed, for that they were tired out with their long jour|ney, no &s;ooner e&s;pied <HI>Cyrus</HI> comming forward with his armie, but a man might well thinke they were right joyous and glad, as if out of &s;ome &s;torme and tem|pe&s;t they had arrived to a &s;afe harbour. <HI>Cyrus</HI> at the fir&s;t &s;ight, mervailed there|at: but when hee under&s;tood what the matter was, &s;o long as they rode all a|front toward him, he led his forces in order of battaile again&s;t them. But &s;o &s;oone as the enemies knowing how the world went, reculed and fled, <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded the light hor&s;emen appointed therefore, to make hote pur&s;uit, and him&s;elfe with the re&s;t followed hard after according as he thought it ex|pedient. There, might a man have &s;eene, &s;ome Chariots taken, out of which the drivers were fallen, partly in the very turning and partly otherwi&s;e: others againe intercepted by the hor&s;emen and &s;urpri&s;ed. They &s;lew al&s;o very many; and among the re&s;t, the traitour him&s;elf who had hurt <HI>Gadatas.</HI> Meane-while the A&s;&s;yrian footmen who were be&s;ieging <HI>Gadatas</HI> his fortre&s;&s;e, abandoned that en|terpri&s;e. Some fled for &s;uccour into the Ca&s;tle, which had revolted from <HI>Gada|tas:</HI> others got away before their enemies, and did put them&s;elves into a great Citie of the A&s;&s;yrian Kings, whereinto him&s;elfe with his chariots and hor&s;es was retyred. Vpon the&s;e exploits thus atchieved, <HI>Cyrus</HI> returned backe into <HI>Gadatas</HI> his country: and after order given unto tho&s;e whom it concerned, to take charge of the captives, he went directly to &s;ee how <HI>Gadatas</HI> did upon his hurt. And as he went forward, <HI>Gadatas</HI> having by that time, his wound dre&s;|&s;ed and bound up, met him on the way. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aw him, he rejoyced and &s;aid. I was comming to you, for to &s;ee how you did: And I, quoth <HI>Ga|datas,</HI> &s;o God me love, was going, to behold you againe and &s;ee what a coun|tenance you carry, bearing as you doe this brave minde: who, when I wi&s;t not my &s;elfe what need you had now of my helpe, nor you ever undertooke or promi&s;ed to doe this for mee, ne yet in your owne particular received &s;o much as any &s;mall plea&s;ure at my hand; but onely for that I &s;eemed unto you, in &s;ome mea&s;ure to benefit my friends, have &s;o lovingly and with &s;uch affection reskued mee: as that now for any thing in mee, I might have peri&s;hed, but by your meanes I am &s;aved. And here, my good <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I report mee to the Gods whom I take to record, were I as perfect and &s;ound a man, as when I was new borne, and had I begotten children, I doubt whether ever I &s;hould have had a child of mine owne, who would have prooved &s;o kinde to mee, as you have beene. For, I have knowne other unnaturall children; (and even for example this very King of A&s;&s;yria that now is) who hath wrought his father much more woe and trouble, than him&s;elfe is able now to worke you. Whereas <HI>Cyrus</HI> returned this an&s;were. My <HI>Gadatas,</HI> You make a great mervaile of mee now, letting pa&s;&s;e I a&s;&s;ure you a greater wonder. And what might that be, quoth <HI>Gadatas?</HI> Even this, &s;aith he, that &s;o many Per&s;ians, &s;o many Medes, &s;o many Hyrcanians, and all the Armenians, Sacans and Cadu&s;ians here pre&s;ent,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> The good Remon&s;trances of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as touching the fault of the Cadu&s;ian Prince. The treatie with the King of A&s;&s;yria, for the good of his people.</HEAD>
<P>BVT the Cadu&s;ian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Damadas.</NOTE> Leader, who having the conduct of the rereward, had no hand in the chace, yet de&s;irous for his part al&s;o to doe &s;ome notable peece of &s;ervice by him&s;elfe, without acquainting <HI>Cyrus</HI> with his de&s;igne, and &s;aying never a word unto him, made a rode into the territorie toward Baby|lon and harried it. But whiles his hor&s;emen were raunging abroad and &s;trag|gling a&s;under, the A&s;&s;yrian King i&s;&s;uing out of a Citie of his owne whereinto he was before fled, came upon them at unwares, with his armie very well appoin|ted, and in order of battaile, to encounter him. And when he di&s;covered them to be the Cadu&s;ians onely, he charged upon them, and among many other &s;lew the &s;aid Commaunder of them. He tooke many hor&s;es al&s;o of the Cadu&s;ians, and de&s;poyled them of all that bootie which they had gotten and were driving away. Thus the King of A&s;&s;yria, after he had followed the Cadu&s;ians in rout, &s;o farre as he might with &s;afetie, returned. As for the formo&s;t of the Cadu&s;i|ans, they recovered the Campe by the &s;hutting in of the evening and &s;o e&s;caped &s;afe. <HI>Cyrus</HI> being adverti&s;ed of this di&s;a&s;ter, went forth and met the Cadu&s;ians. As he &s;aw any one wounded, him hee received and comforted, yea and &s;ent to <HI>Gadatas</HI> for to be cured. The re&s;t he be&s;towed in pavilions by them&s;elves togi|ther, and with great care gave order that they &s;hould have all nece&s;&s;aries, a&s;&s;u|ming unto him as a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, certeine of the Per&s;ian Homotimi. (For, in &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e, good and hone&s;t men are willing to &s;et to their hel|ping hands) And for his owne part verily, how much hee grieved it evidently appeared, in that it being now &s;upper time, when the re&s;t were at &s;upper, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;till with his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Serjeants.</NOTE> Mini&s;ters, Phy&s;icians and Chirurgions gave attendance, and by his good will left not one neglected and unlooked to, but if hee did not in his owne per&s;on &s;ee to them, every man might plainly perceive, that he &s;ent others to tend them. And &s;o for that time they went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>By the breake of day, he made Proclamation by the publike Criers that the Rulers of the other A&s;&s;ociates, but the Cadu&s;ians all in generall &s;hould a&s;&s;em|ble togither: and unto them hee delivered the&s;e or &s;uch like words. My friends and Confederates. An ordinary accident it is among men, that hath befalne unto you. For, men yee are, and that men &s;hould erre, is in my conceit, no wonder. And yet by good right meet it is, that of this infortunitie we &s;hould reape &s;ome profit. Namely, To learne, never hereafter to &s;ever from the
<PB N="122" REF="71">whole body of the armie, any Regiment, weaker than the enimies forces. Nei|ther &s;peake I this, quoth he, that a man ought not &s;ometimes to goe out, when the ca&s;e &s;o requireth, with a le&s;&s;e power, than wherewith the Cadu&s;ians ere|while did &s;et forth. But if one enterpri&s;e an exploit, imparting his minde fir&s;t to him, who is able and &s;ufficient to helpe; and &s;o goe forth, he may perchance faile of his purpo&s;e and be deceived: yet as po&s;&s;ible it is, that hee who &s;tayeth &s;till behind, may delude the enemies, diverting them another way from tho&s;e who went forth. There are be&s;ides, other meanes to worke trouble unto the enemies, and thereby to procure the &s;afetie of friends. And &s;o verily, he that is gone apart from the re&s;t, may not be coumpted ab&s;ent, but to depend upon the re&s;idue of the forces behind. But he that departeth, making no man privie beforehand where he is, differeth nothing at all, from him, who of him&s;elfe a|lone undertaketh an expedition. Howbeit for this mi&s;chance, quoth he, that hath happened, God willing, ere it bee long wee will be avenged of our ene|mies: For, &s;o &s;oone as ever yee have taken a &s;hort dinner, I my &s;elfe will bring you where the deed was done: and there will we both bury our dead, and al&s;o if God will, &s;hew unto our enemies, that in the very place where they thinke they have gotten the upper hand, there be others better men than them|&s;elves: in &s;o much as they &s;hall take no great joy, to &s;ee that plot of ground, on which they &s;lew our A&s;&s;ociates. But in ca&s;e, they will not come forth and meet us in the field, let us &s;et their villages on fire, let us harry and wa&s;t their country, that they may have no plea&s;ure, in the &s;ight of tho&s;e things which they have done to us, but contrariwi&s;e &s;orrow, and grieve to behold their owne calami|ties. Goe yee therefore all the re&s;t, quoth he, to your dinners. As for you that are Cadu&s;ians: Fir&s;t, choo&s;e according to your owne law and cu&s;tome, &s;ome one to be your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Generall, or Coronell.</NOTE> Prince, who with the au&s;picious helpe of the Gods and us, may take the charge of you, and &s;ee what yee &s;tand in need of. When yee have elected him and dined withall, &s;end whom yee have elected unto mee. And &s;o they did accordingly. But <HI>Cyrus,</HI> after hee had brought forth his armie, and appointed him to his Regiment whom the Cadu&s;ians had made choice of, commaunded him to lead the &s;ame arraunged in order of battaile clo&s;e to him|&s;elfe, to the end, quoth he, that if it be po&s;&s;ible wee may encourage the&s;e men againe. Thus &s;et they forth, and being come to the place, they both entered the Cadu&s;ians, and harried the country. And when they had &s;o done, and got|ten victuall and other provi&s;ion out of the enemies land, they departed and re|turned into the territorie of <HI>Gadatas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> then, con&s;idering that they who had revolted unto him, bordering as they did upon Babylon, &s;hould &s;u&s;teine much detriment by &s;o ill a neighbour, unle&s;&s;e him&s;elfe were continually pre&s;ent with them, commaunded as many of the enemies as he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, to &s;ay unto the A&s;&s;yrian King, and withall &s;ent an Herauld to denounce unto him in his name, that ready hee was for his part to forbeare the husbandmen that tilled the ground, and would doe them no wrong; in ca&s;e the King likewi&s;e would permit their labourers and husband|men, who had revolted unto him, to till their grounds in peace. And you ve|rily, quoth he, to the King, were you able to prohibit them, &s;hall when you have all done hinder but a few: For their territories are but &s;mall who have turned from you to me: but it lies in my power to &s;uffer a large country of yours to be tilled. And as touching the harve&s;t and inning of the fruits therein; if
<PB N="123" REF="71">the warre continue, he &s;hall reape and gather all, (as I &s;uppo&s;e) that is the Con|querour. But if peace &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, who but your &s;elfe &s;hall have and hold all? For &s;urely, if any of my &s;ouldiers &s;hall ri&s;e and take armes again&s;t you or yours again&s;t mee, we will of both &s;ides, quoth he, doe our be&s;t to cha&s;tice and puni&s;h the delinquents. Having put the&s;e in&s;tructions in this wi&s;e into the He|raulds mouth, he &s;ent him away. The A&s;&s;yrians when they heard this me&s;&s;age, did the be&s;t they could to per&s;wade their King, to condi&s;cend unto the&s;e condi|tions, and to leave as little warre behind, as might be. And verily the A&s;&s;yrian King, whether it were through the per&s;wa&s;ion of his owne nation, or for that him&s;elfe was willing enough, and inclined that way already, a&s;&s;ented thereto. Hereupon capitulated and covenanted it was betweene the&s;e two Potentates, that the husbandmen &s;hould have peace, and the armed &s;ouldiers warre. Thus much effected <HI>Cyrus</HI> in the behalfe of husbandmen. As touching pa&s;turage for their labouring bea&s;ts, he gave order unto his friends, That it &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned and &s;et out, as they would them&s;elves, where their owne Deme&s;nes and Seigno|ries lay: but from the enemies they drave booties where&s;oever they could light upon any: to the end, that unto his A&s;&s;ociates the warfare might be the more plea&s;ant. For admit they gat no victuals and nece&s;&s;aries, yet the daungers were all one: but to live of their enemies country, &s;eemed to make their &s;ouldiery and &s;ervice the ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>Well, whiles <HI>Cyrus</HI> now made preparation to depart out of tho&s;e quarters, <HI>Gadatas</HI> came and &s;hewed him&s;elfe, bringing and driving before him many and &s;undry pre&s;ents, as having a large habitation, and the &s;ame well &s;tored: and a|mong the re&s;t, many hor&s;es of &s;ervice, which he had taken from his owne men of armes, &s;uch as he di&s;tru&s;ted for their treacherous lying in wait for him. And as he approached neere unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> he &s;pake in this wi&s;e. Here Sir, quoth he, I bring now unto you the&s;e things, that you may for the pre&s;ent u&s;e them as you need. But thinke this withall, that what&s;oever be&s;ide is mine, the &s;ame is al&s;o yours. For neither have I nor ever &s;hall, a child of mine owne body begotten, unto whom I may leave my hou&s;e and inheritance, but when I die, my whole line and name mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;itie be extinct with me. And the Gods, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I take to witne&s;&s;e, who both &s;ee all and heare all, that I have not committed ei|ther in word or deed, any unju&s;t or di&s;hone&s;t act, whereby I &s;hould de&s;erve the&s;e calamities. And as he uttered the&s;e words, he bewailed his owne fortune, and for very teares could &s;peake no more. <HI>Cyrus</HI> hearing his pittious mone, tooke commi&s;eration of the mans hard hap and calamitie, &s;aying withall. As for the hor&s;es, quoth he, I accept of them. For hereby &s;hall I doe you a plea&s;ure, all the while I be&s;tow them upon tho&s;e men, who are better affected unto you, as it appeareth, than tho&s;e who&s;e ere-while they were. And, the Per&s;ian Cavallery I &s;hall &s;hortly make up, to the number of 10000 hor&s;emen, the thing that I have &s;o long de&s;ired. Your other trea&s;ure, quoth he, take away, and keepe it to your &s;elfe, untill you &s;ee me have &s;o much, as that in requitall I be not inferiour to you. For, if at your departure you give me more than you receive at my hands, I know not, &s;o helpe me God, how to doe, but to be grieved and a&s;hamed. To this <HI>Gadatas</HI> &s;aid, Truly I beleeve you herein. For, I &s;ee your gentle nature and franke di&s;po&s;ition. But, &s;ee I pray you, whether I be able to keepe the &s;ame? For, &s;o long as we and the A&s;&s;yrian King were friends, my Patrimony was thought to be a very faire livelode and e&s;tate. For, lying as it did neere unto that great
<PB N="124" REF="72">and populous Citie Babylon, looke what commoditie might grow from a no|ble and ample Citie, wee got and enjoyed the &s;ame: and what trouble or en|combrance might ari&s;e from thence, we could retire hither home and be farre remote therefro. But now, &s;tanding as we doe in termes of enmitie, evident it is that after you be once departed, both we our&s;elves &s;hall be forelayed with our whole family: and &s;o farre as I can &s;ee, a pen&s;ive and &s;orrowfull life wee &s;hall lead, having our enemies &s;o neere, and &s;eeing them to bee more pui&s;&s;ant than our &s;elves. But, peradventure you will &s;ay. And why thought you not &s;o much before you revolted? Certes, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> becau&s;e my minde fixed upon &s;uch a wrong done, and blinded with very anger, con&s;idered not what was be&s;t and &s;a|fe&s;t for me: but conceived and ever was with child of the&s;e fan&s;ies. Will it ne|ver be, that I &s;hall be revenged of him, an enemy both to God and man? him, I &s;ay, who mortally and continually hateth not one, if he doe him any wrong, but if he doe but &s;u&s;pect another better than him&s;elfe? And therefore, I thinke verily, that being &s;o bad as he is, all the confederates that he employeth in his &s;ervice, he &s;hall finde wor&s;e than him&s;elfe. And &s;ay, there bee any one that &s;ee|meth better than another; Bee a&s;&s;ured, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you &s;hall never need to fight a|gain&s;t any good and valiant man, but he will be &s;ufficient &s;o to worke and con|trive, as to kill him to your hand that is his better. And as for mole&s;ting mee, verily, he will I &s;uppo&s;e with the helpe of tho&s;e wicked ones overmatch me.</P>
<P>When <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard him &s;ay thus, he thought, that he &s;pake to the point, and what was worthy to be con&s;idered. Whereupon he inferred pre&s;ently and &s;aid. How &s;ay you then <HI>Gadatas,</HI> have you not fortified your holds and ca&s;tles with garri&s;ons for your owne defen&s;e and &s;afetie, when&s;oever you &s;hall enter into them? And doe you not your &s;elfe in per&s;on goe with us in this expedition, that if God be &s;till on our &s;ide, as now he is, this [wicked Prince] may &s;tand in feare of you, and not you of him? Goe along therefore with me, and what ever of yours you take plea&s;ure to &s;ee, or delight to companie with, have with you. Certes, you may as I &s;uppo&s;e &s;tand me in very good &s;tead, and I will endevour likewi&s;e to my power for to plea&s;ure you. Which offer when <HI>Gadatas</HI> heard, he tooke heart againe and &s;aid. Is it po&s;&s;ible for me to tru&s;&s;e up bag and baggage, and to gather togither all that I have before you depart? For, de&s;irous I am, quoth he, to have away my mother with me. You may very well, quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For I will &s;tay for your &s;ake, untill you &s;ay that all is well. So <HI>Gadatas</HI> for the pre&s;ent tooke his leave, and by the advi&s;e of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> did put garri&s;ons into tho&s;e Ca&s;tles which he had fortified: and gat togither all &s;uch &s;tuffe and furniture, as might be&s;eeme an ample and &s;tately hou&s;e for to be inhabited. Moreover, of tho&s;e about him he tooke &s;uch tru&s;ty friends, as in whom hee had delight: yea and many likewi&s;e whom he di&s;tru&s;ted: and of tho&s;e, hee compelled &s;ome to bring away with them their wives, others their &s;i&s;ters: to the end that being yoked to them, hee might hold them in their alleageance. Thus <HI>Cyrus</HI> having <HI>Gadatas</HI> in his retinew, departed: Who &s;erved his turne very well, to direct him in the waies, to &s;hew him where water, where forage, provander, and corne was to be had, to the end he might alwaies encampe in places of mo&s;t plentie.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> as he returned into <HI>Media,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed before Babylon: and &s;urpri|&s;ed certaine Forts upon the Frontiers.</HEAD>
<P>NOw when he marched on, and di&s;covering in his journey, the city of Babylon, perceived be&s;ides that the way which he went, led directly to the very wals, he called <HI>Gobryas</HI> and <HI>Gadatas</HI> unto him. Of whom hee demaunded, if there were not another pa&s;&s;age, that they might not approach the wall &s;o neere? Then <HI>Gobryas,</HI> There are, my Lord, quoth he, very many ave|nues, but I thought you were now minded to lead your army as nigh as you could unto the City, for to &s;hew unto them within, your armie how brave and pui&s;&s;ant it is. For, when you had a le&s;&s;e power, you came clo&s;e to the very wall, and they beheld us to be but few in number. And now, although the King be in readine&s;&s;e, as hee &s;aid him&s;elfe he was preparing to fight, yet I know very well, that when he vieweth your forces, he will thinke his owne to be yet unrea|dy. To this, <HI>Cyrus</HI> made an&s;wer thus. You &s;eeme to mervaile my <HI>Gobryas,</HI> that when I came with a le&s;&s;e armie by farre, I advanced hard to the City wall, and now having a greater power, am unwilling to march under the &s;ame. But mer|vaile not thereat, quoth he. For, it is not all one to advance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> To lead by, or a&s;ide.</NOTE> clo&s;e forward, and to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> pa&s;&s;e by aloofe. For, all men advance forward, &s;o arraunged, as they thinke they may fight be&s;t: and yet tho&s;e that be wi&s;e, u&s;e in withdrawing and rety|ring their forces, to con&s;ider, how they may get away, not mo&s;t &s;peedily, but with greate&s;t &s;afety. Now, of nece&s;&s;ity, pa&s;&s;e by wee mu&s;t, with our wagons &s;tretched out in length to the view: but withall, other porters and carriers of baggage very neere togither and hidden. And all the&s;e ought to be fen&s;ed very clo&s;e with armed men. Neither mu&s;t our carriages be &s;eene of our enemies any where without armes. In which regard, if we march &s;o, it cannot otherwi&s;e be, but the &s;trong and able men to fight, mu&s;t be placed clo&s;e to the weake and fee|ble. And therefore, if the enemies would in any place &s;allie forth thicke out of the City and charge us, where&s;oever they &s;hall encounter with us, they will be able more fiercely to maintaine the fight, than we that thus pa&s;&s;e by. Againe, to tho&s;e that march &s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> in length, there can no helpe and &s;upply be brought, but a great way off, and long fir&s;t: Whereas they from the wals, may in a trice, both runne to &s;uccour them that are &s;o neere, and al&s;o as &s;oone retire againe. But if we pa&s;&s;e along no neerer than &s;o as they may &s;ee us, keeping onely the &s;ame breadth as now we doe in our march, our number verily they &s;hall behold, but by rea&s;on of the glittering harnoi&s;e and armed men intermingled among, the whole multitude and body of the armie mu&s;t needs &s;eeme terrible. Now, if as we march in this order, they &s;hall clo&s;ely &s;et upon us, wee di&s;covering them before a good way off, &s;hall not be taken tardie nor unprovided. But rather, my good friends, quoth he, they will not &s;o much as give the attempt, when they mu&s;t goe farre from the walles: except they &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves with their whole power able to outmatch us and all our forces. For, thus to goe a&s;ide and out of the way is a fearefull thing. When he had thus &s;aid, he was thought un|to them all that were pre&s;ent to &s;peake fully to the purpo&s;e. <HI>Gobryas</HI> therefore led as hee commaunded him. Thus, as the armie pa&s;&s;ed aloofe by the Citie,
<PB N="126" REF="73"><HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe held of, and drew backe &s;o, as evermore hee made the rereward &s;tronger and &s;tronger. After hee had pa&s;&s;ed forward in this &s;ort, &s;o as within few dayes following, hee was come unto the Confines of the A&s;&s;yrians and Medes, from whence he had fir&s;t &s;et out, finding there three fortre&s;&s;es of the A&s;&s;yrians, one of them which was the weake&s;t he a&s;&s;ailed and forced the other two, what with the terrible &s;ummons of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and what by the faire per&s;wa&s;i|ons of <HI>Gadatas,</HI> the Captaines of the garri&s;ons within, &s;urrender.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> returned to the Marches of Media, and laboured to appea&s;e the wrath of <HI>Cyaxares.</HI> The an&s;wer al&s;o that he made unto him.</HEAD>
<P>THESE exploits atchieved, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ent unto <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> requiring him per|&s;onally to repaire unto the Armie, to the end they might devi&s;e togither and con&s;ult, as touching the keeping of tho&s;e holds newly taken in: as al&s;o, that upon the &s;ight of the Armie, he might advi&s;e farther concerning o|ther affaires, what he thought meet to be done. Yet &s;ay, quoth he, that (if hee thinke &s;o good) I am ready to come unto him; there to encampe. Thus the me&s;&s;enger went to declare this errand. Meane-while <HI>Cyrus</HI> gave order unto <HI>Ga|datas</HI> for to adorne and &s;et out mo&s;t gorgeou&s;ly that A&s;&s;yrian Kings Pavilion which the Medes had cho&s;en out for <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> with all the other furniture that it had, al&s;o to bring the fore&s;aid two Ladies into the womens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cabin, or Parlour.</NOTE> roome within the tent, and with them the mu&s;icall chantere&s;&s;es, &s;elected for <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> which they did accordingly. But when he that was &s;ent to <HI>Cyaxares</HI> had delivered his me&s;&s;age, no &s;ooner heard he it, but he thought it better, that the Army &s;hould remaine there &s;till upon the Confines. For, the Per&s;ians al&s;o whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;ent for, were now come unto him, being in number 40000 one with another, of Archers and light Targuatiers. And therefore when <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;aw that the&s;e likewi&s;e much endammaged the Medes land, he thought it would be more for his ea&s;e, to be di&s;charged even of them, rather than to receive a multitude of o|thers unto them. Now when he, who had the leading of this armie out of Per|&s;ia, asked <HI>Cyaxares</HI> according to the tenour of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Letter, whether he had any need of the &s;aid forces? and he againe an&s;wered, that he had none; O he, the very &s;ame day hearing of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his comming, went forth with his power towards him. The morrow after, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> with the re&s;idue of the Medes hor&s;e|men that remained with him, did put him&s;elfe on his journey. And when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was adverti&s;ed of his approch, he tooke unto him the Per&s;ian hor&s;emen, who by this time were in number much increa&s;ed; all the Medes likewi&s;e and Ar|menians, the Hyrcanians al&s;o and other Confederates, as many as were be&s;t mounted and armed withall, and &s;o met <HI>Cyaxares</HI> and &s;hewed unto him his whole power. But <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> &s;eeing &s;uch a &s;hew of &s;o many brave men accom|panying <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and contrariwi&s;e &s;o &s;mall a traine, and the &s;ame of ba&s;e accompt, attending upon his owne per&s;on, thought it a great di&s;honour and di&s;grace unto his Maje&s;tie, and thereat grieved not a little. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> alighted from his hor&s;e, and when he came towards him for to ki&s;&s;e him, as the manner was, <HI>Cy|axares</HI> likewi&s;e di&s;mounted in deed, but turned away and would not ki&s;&s;e him: nay, hee wept amaine, that all men might &s;ee him. Whereupon <HI>Cyrus</HI> com|maunded
<PB N="127" REF="73">all others to goe a&s;ide and be &s;till. But him&s;elfe taking <HI>Cyaxares</HI> by the right hand, and leading him out of the way under a row of certaine Date trees, gave commaundement, to lay Median carpets and ruggs for him on the ground, upon which when he had cau&s;ed him to &s;it downe, he &s;ate him&s;elfe by his &s;ide, and began to breake with him in this manner.</P>
<P>Tell mee on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">For Gods &s;ake.</NOTE> Gods behalfe, my good Vnkle, why you are &s;o angry with me? what offen&s;ive matter &s;ee you, to take it &s;o grievou&s;ly as you doe? Hereun|to <HI>Cyaxares</HI> made an&s;wer after this &s;ort. Becau&s;e, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I being reputed to have lineally de&s;cended, &s;o farre as the memorie of man or auncient records doe te|&s;tifie, from Kings in old time mine Aunce&s;tors, knowne al&s;o to be a Kings &s;onne, and taken for a King my &s;elfe, &s;ee how ba&s;ely and unbe&s;eeming my e&s;tate I ride. Contrariwi&s;e with what a companie of my retinew, and with a warlike power be&s;ides you beare a port here, and magnificently &s;hew your &s;elfe: It would have grieved one, in my conceit, to have beene &s;erved thus at an enemies hand: but &s;o to be entreated of them, by whom there was lea&s;t cau&s;e, it is before God, a greater indignity by farre. And better it were for me, I &s;uppo&s;e to bee buried quicke tenne times in the earth, than to be &s;eene &s;o abject, and to &s;ee mine owne &s;ervants and &s;ubjects, thus to neglect me, yea and to make a laughing &s;tocke of me. For, it is not unknowne unto me, that not onely you are of greater pui&s;&s;ance than I, but al&s;o even mine owne va&s;&s;als are come to meet me more mighty than my &s;elfe: and &s;o well appointed, as that they be able to doe mee more harme than I can them. And as hee uttered the&s;e words, the teares came upon him more and more, in &s;o much as hee inforced <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o to weepe, &s;o as his eyes &s;tood full againe of water. Who after hee had &s;taied and continued him&s;elfe a while brake out into the&s;e words.</P>
<P>But you, <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> neither &s;ay truly nor deeme aright, in ca&s;e you thinke that the <HI>Medes</HI> by my pre&s;ence with them are &s;o well appointed, as to bee able for to worke your woe. Certes, I nothing mervaile that you are wroth and affraied. And whether you be offended with them ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly, let that for me, goe by: For, well I know, that if I &s;hould plead in their behalfe, you would take it to the heart. But, for a Prince and Soveraigne, to be angry and di&s;plea|&s;ed with all his &s;ubjects at once, I hold it a foule fault. For, many enemies mu&s;t needs bee procured, when a man is terrible unto many. And when one is &s;et again&s;t all, he giveth them occa&s;ion to joyne all in one mind, and to draw in a line. In which regards, be you a&s;&s;ured, I &s;ent the&s;e your men backe unto you not without my &s;elfe, as fearing on their part, le&s;t ought might by rea&s;on of your indignation have fallen out, which we all &s;hould rue. And verily by Gods helpe, for the&s;e matters you &s;hall incurre no daunger &s;o long as I am pre&s;ent. But whereas you thinke your &s;elfe wronged by me, that goeth to my heart, if endeavouring as I doe, all that I can to plea&s;ure my friends mo&s;t, I be thought afterwards for my labour to worke and practi&s;e the contrary. Well, Let us not thus ra&s;hly conte&s;t and blame one another: But &s;ee, if it bee po&s;&s;ible in mo&s;t plaine termes what manner of injurie mine is? And verily, content I am for my &s;elfe to make that offer which is mo&s;t ju&s;t and equall. If it appeare that I have done ill, acknowledge I will and confe&s;&s;e my fault. But, if it bee found, that I have done nothing ami&s;&s;e, nor intended evill, will not you then yeeld, that you have not beene wronged by me? It mu&s;t needs be &s;o quoth he. Nay, what and if it &s;hall evidently be knowne, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that I have been the author of your
<PB N="128" REF="74">welfare? that I have &s;tudied to conferre as many benefits as I could upon you, will you not judge me worthy of prai&s;e rather than of rebuke? That is but rea|&s;on, quoth <HI>Cyaxares.</HI> Why! then &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> let us examine in particular every thing that I have done: and &s;o it will mo&s;t evidently aopeare, what therein is good, and what is bad? Begin we, I &s;ay, if you thinke that will &s;erve, at the very originall. For, what time as you perceived many of your enemies a&s;&s;embled, and tho&s;e already come forward again&s;t you, and invading your land; what did you but &s;end immediately to the State of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> craving their aide, yea and to my &s;elfe e&s;pecially, intreating me both to come, and al&s;o to labour, if any <HI>Per&s;i|ans</HI> were &s;ent, to be their Leader and Commaunder? Per&s;waded therefore I was by your words: I came unto you in per&s;on, and brought unto you men, for number many, and for valour the be&s;t I could. True it is quoth he, you came in|deed. Tell me then, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Fir&s;t, whether herein you condemne any injuri|ous dealing of mine to youward, or rather commend my<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> beneficence to you? Apparent it is quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> that hereby I mu&s;t acknowledge your good dea|ling. Goe to then, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when your enemies were come, and that there was no remedie, but fought they mu&s;t be with, did you in that tryall perceive me, either to &s;hrinke for any paines, or to &s;pare for any perill? No &s;urely quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> I prote&s;t before God. To proceed, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> what time as by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the victory was ours, and the enemies fled. When I reque&s;ted you, that wee might with our united forces, pur&s;ue them, and in common revenge our &s;elves of them, and what event &s;oever en&s;ued thereof, good or bad, to take part indifferently? in the&s;e things can you impute any avarice unto me, as if I &s;ought mine owne advantage above others? At this, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> held his peace. Then replied <HI>Cyrus</HI> and went on in this wi&s;e. Since it plea&s;ethyou at this que&s;ti|on to keepe &s;ilence rather than to an&s;wer: yet tell mee thus much I pray you, whether you tooke your &s;elfe to be wronged in that, when you thought it &s;tood not with your owne &s;afety to follow the chace, I would not &s;uffer you in pro|per per&s;on, to bee in any part of the daunger, but reque&s;ted you onely to &s;end unto me &s;ome of your hor&s;emen: Shew I &s;ay, whether in this reque&s;t of mine, I did you wrong, e&s;pecially &s;eeing I had already borne my &s;elfe in your &s;ervice as a true confederate? And when <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;aid nothing to this al&s;o. Seeing then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> it is not your plea&s;ure to an&s;wer unto this point: Speake yet from henceforth, whether I wronged you, in that, when you made me this an&s;wer, that perceiving as you did the <HI>Medes</HI> addicted to Ioviall mirth, you would not have them to give it over, nor force them to enter upon a daungerous peece of &s;ervice, Tell me I &s;ay, Thinke you that I offred you any hard mea&s;ure, in that I neglected to be angry with you, but eft&s;oones entreated of you afterwards, that thing, than which I knew, there was nothing of le&s;&s;e moment for you to graunt, nor ea&s;ier to be impo&s;ed upon the <HI>Medes?</HI> For, I prayed you onely to give me &s;uch as willingly would follow me. Which being graunted, yet was I never the neerer, unle&s;&s;e I could per&s;wade them. To them I went, I per&s;wa|ded with them: and looke whom I could prevaile with, I tooke with me, and went my waies with your good leave and permi&s;&s;ion. Now if you e&s;teeme this blame-worthy, then &s;urely even to take any thing at your hands which you frankly give, cannot, as it &s;hould &s;eeme, be void of blame. To be &s;hort, Thus and thus wee did &s;et forth. When wee were gone, what was exploited by us which is not to all men knowne? Was not our enemies campe by force wonne?
<PB N="129" REF="74">Were not many of them &s;laine that tooke armes and ro&s;e again&s;t you? And of tho&s;e that remained alive, lo&s;t not many their armour? and as many their hor|&s;es?

And &s;uppo&s;e, that I &s;aw my &s;ubjects &s;u&s;taine &s;ome little injury at your hands, I &s;hould, me thinks, grieve le&s;&s;e than now I doe, &s;ee|ing how great benefits they have received under you. Now if you thinke that I weigh the&s;e matters incon&s;iderately, alter the ca&s;e, and turne the &s;ame from me to your &s;elfe, and then take them into your owne con&s;ideration. Set ca&s;e I &s;ay, that a man &s;hould make &s;o much of tho&s;e dogs which you keepe for the &s;afety of your &s;elfe and yours, as that thereby he cau&s;e them to be more familiar unto him than to you, &s;hould hee with this ob&s;equious diligence of his, plea&s;e you well? But &s;ay; that you thinke this but a &s;mall matter, con&s;ider this al&s;o, If any one &s;hould frame tho&s;e &s;ervitours of yours, (&s;uch I meane as you have and keep, partly for the guard of your per&s;on, and in part to wait upon you,) &s;o, as they had rather be his than yours, would you for this good demerit of his con him any thanks? Againe, to come unto that which men love be&s;t and accoumpt as their owne mo&s;t entierly: Suppo&s;e another man were &s;o double diligent in at|tendance about your wife, as that hee brought her in the end to be more kind to him&s;elfe than to you, &s;hould he by this well doing of his delight your heart? He would mi&s;&s;e in my conceit of that and come farre &s;hort; Nay, well I wote, that who&s;oever did &s;o, &s;hould of all others wrong you mo&s;t. Moreover, to &s;peake that which mo&s;t doth parallele this pre&s;ent griefe of mine, If any man dealt &s;o courteou&s;ly with tho&s;e <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> whom you have brought unto us, as that they made choi&s;e to follow him rather than you, would you take him to be your friend? I think verily no. Nay he would repute him a greater enimy to you, than if he had killed many of them. Say, that &s;ome friend of yours upon occa|&s;ion of &s;uch a loving word as this, [Here, take of my goods as much as you
<PB N="128" REF="75">will] &s;hould after he heard you &s;o &s;ay, goe and &s;eize upon all that he could lay hand on, and &s;o with your &s;ub&s;tance enrich him&s;elfe, whiles you have not &s;o much as a meane u&s;e of them, could you po&s;&s;ibly hold &s;uch a friend unreprove|able? Semblably, my <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e that I have &s;uffered, if not the &s;ame eve|ry way, yet &s;urely the like at your hands. For, true it is indeed which you &s;ay, namely that when I graunted you leave, to take up all voluntaries, you went away with them &s;o, as that you had my whole power, and left me alone &s;olita|ry. And now, for&s;ooth, what you have gotten with the helpe of my forces, you bring unto me, and enlarge this my dominion with mine owne power, whiles I being no coadjutour with you in atchieving the&s;e commodities, &s;hew my &s;elfe, me thinkes no better than a woman, in doing plea&s;ures both to other men, and al&s;o to the&s;e my &s;ubjects. So, by this reckoning, you appeare to be the man, and I not, worthy to rule and be a King. And thinke you <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that the&s;e be benefits and good turnes? and certainly you know this full well, that if you had re&s;pe|cted me any whit, you would have beene better advi&s;ed, and bereft me of any thing rather than of my honour and dignity. For, what boote gaine I by this bargaine, to have my kingdome never &s;o much enlarged and my &s;elfe de&s;pi&s;ed? For, in this re&s;pect, ruled I the <HI>Medes,</HI> not becau&s;e I am better and worthier than they all, but for that they reputed me every way worthier than them&s;elves. As <HI>Cyaxares</HI> thus &s;pake, <HI>Cyrus</HI> interrupted his &s;peech and &s;aid. For Gods &s;ake, good unkle, If ever heretofore I have done you any plea&s;ure, gratifie me now, I be|&s;eech you in that I &s;hall reque&s;t of you. Make an end once of reprooving me, and when you have made a prou&s;e of us, how loyally we &s;tand affected to you: if it appeare that tho&s;e atchievements of mine, were performed for your good, embrace me as I do you, and take me to be your well de&s;erving friend. If other|therwi&s;e, then blame me and &s;pare not. Well, quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> peradventure you are in the right. And even &s;o will I doe. What then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Shall I be &s;o bold as to ki&s;&s;e you? Yes verily, if you be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed &s;aid he. And will you not turne away, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as you did erewhile? No, &s;aid he. And &s;o <HI>Cyrus</HI> ki&s;&s;ed him. Which when the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> with the re&s;t (and tho&s;e were many) &s;aw: (For, they were all in &s;u&s;pen&s;e what would come of this in the end,) they became immediately right glad and rejoyced. Then <HI>Cyaxares</HI> and <HI>Cyrus</HI> both, mounted on hor&s;ebacke and rode before. The <HI>Medes</HI> followed <HI>Cy|axares</HI> their King; For, <HI>Cyrus</HI> beckened unto them &s;o to do. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> attended upon <HI>Cyrus.</HI> After whom the re&s;idue followed in order.</P>
<P>When they were come to the Campe, and had brought <HI>Cyaxares</HI> unto his Pavilion richly dight for him; They who were appointed thereto, provided all things meet and nece&s;&s;arie for him. But the re&s;t of the <HI>Medes,</HI> all the vacant time before &s;upper that <HI>Cyaxares</HI> had, repaired into the Pre&s;ence: &s;ome of their owne accord, others by commaundement from <HI>Cyrus,</HI> (and tho&s;e were the greater number) pre&s;enting unto him their gifts. One a deft and faire Cup-bearer: ano|ther a good and skilfull cooke: Here comes in one with a baker, another with a &s;inging woman, one brings drinking<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or flagons, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> cups, another gorgeous and trim appa|rell. And for the mo&s;t part every one gave him one e&s;peciall thing or other, out of that which they had gotten. In &s;o much as <HI>Cyaxares</HI> began to retract, and change his mind, confe&s;&s;ing that neither <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;tollen away their hearts from him, nor the <HI>Medes</HI> were le&s;&s;e ob&s;ervant unto him than before. When &s;upper time drew nigh, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> called for <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and becau&s;e it was long &s;ince
<PB N="131" REF="75">he had &s;een him before, reque&s;ted his company at &s;upper. O good unkle quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> will me not to doe that. See you not all the&s;e here, how by my impul|&s;ion they are come hither? I &s;hould not do well therefore, to neglect them and follow mine owne plea&s;ure. For, thus it is quoth he: Souldiers thinking them|&s;elves unregarded, were they valiant before, become much le&s;&s;e courageous; if cowards, they grow far more in&s;olent and malapert. Your &s;elfe therefore, con|&s;idering you have come a great way hither, go now to your &s;upper, and if any doe you honour, &s;ee you embrace and make much of them againe: invite &s;uch I &s;ay and entertaine them with good cheere, that they may have the more affiance in you hereafter. As for me, I will goe my wayes, about &s;uch affaires as I &s;aid. To morrow morning betimes, all the principall men of employment, &s;hall be ready here before your roial tent, to &s;hew them&s;elves: to the end that we and you togither, may con&s;ult what henceforth is to be done. And you being then pre|&s;ent in place, put to que&s;tion, and deliver your own opinion: Whether you hold it expedient to continue the warre, or thinke it now a good time, to di&s;patch the armie? Hereupon <HI>Cyaxares</HI> went to &s;upper. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> calling to him &s;uch friends of his, as were mo&s;t &s;ufficient both for wi&s;edome and execution as need requi|red, made this &s;peech or the like unto them. My loving Friends, what we fir&s;t wi&s;hed and praied for unto the Gods, the &s;ame through their goodne&s;&s;e wee have obtained. For, looke how farre we march on forward, &s;o much ground we get &s;till. Our enemies we &s;ee to be impared: but our &s;elves in number increa|&s;ed and in &s;trength more pui&s;&s;ant. In ca&s;e our A&s;&s;ociats newly come, would be willing to &s;tay with us, more powerable we &s;hall be to effect any thing, whether opportunity &s;erve to winne the &s;ame by force, or to gaine it by per&s;wa&s;ion. And therefore, your part it is no le&s;&s;e than mine, to worke this feat, that the greater number of our &s;aid A&s;&s;ociats may like well of their abode here. And, as in fight|ing a field, he that taketh mo&s;t pri&s;oners, is reputed the hardie&s;t &s;ouldier, even &s;o when coun&s;ell and policy is required, hee that can draw the greater part to our mind, ought by good right to be e&s;teemed mo&s;t eloquent in word, and mo&s;t valiant in deed. Neither &s;peake I this, as if I would have you to premeditate and exhibit &s;ome formall oration which you may pronounce to every one of them: but order the matter &s;o, that they who are by any of you per&s;waded, may &s;hew what they are by their deeds. This, I &s;ay is the charge which I would have you to thinke upon. I for my part will endeavour diligently, that the &s;ouldiers having what victuals and nece&s;&s;aries I can provide for them, may deliberately re&s;olve of this warfare and expedition.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The coun&s;ell that <HI>Cyrus</HI> held about di&s;&s;olving his Armie for that yeere. The prepa|rations which he made again&s;t the yeere next en&s;uing. The Fabricke and En|gins that he devi&s;ed for to batter walles. His chariots armed with pikes and &s;ithes, carrying turrets upon them: Al&s;o the Camels which he provided for the warre.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING thus &s;pent this day, and taken their &s;uppers, they went to re&s;t. The next day early in the morning all the A&s;&s;ociates repayred to the Pavilion gates of <HI>Cyaxares.</HI> And therefore in the time that he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elfe royal|ly to be &s;eene, as hearing that &s;o great a multitude atten|ded at the gates: meane-while I &s;ay <HI>Cyrus</HI> his familiar friends brought with them, &s;ome the Cadu&s;ians who de&s;ired him to tarry, other the Hyrcanians. <HI>Gobryas</HI> came with one, and <HI>Sacas</HI> with another. <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI> came with the Eunuch <HI>Gadatas,</HI> who al&s;o reque&s;ted him to &s;tay. <HI>Cyrus</HI> under&s;tanding that <HI>Gadatas</HI> was long &s;ince full woe and even out of the world for feare, lea&s;t the Armie &s;hould breake up, &s;miling plea&s;antly up|on him, &s;aid. It appeareth evidently, &ocirc; <HI>Gadatas,</HI> that upon the per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes,</HI> you thinke as you &s;ay. Then <HI>Gadatas</HI> &s;tretching up his hands toward heaven, devoutly &s;ware: That hee was not mooved thus to thinke by any in|ducement of <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes.</HI> But I know right well, quoth he, that if ye were gone, my e&s;tate &s;hould utterly be overthrowne. And therefore came I of my &s;elfe unto him, to aske the que&s;tion, what your re&s;olution was, concerning the di&s;|&s;olution of the armie? It &s;hould &s;eeme then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that I doe wrong|fully charge <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes.</HI> Yea &s;urely &s;aid <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI> very unju&s;tly. For, I gain-&s;aid <HI>Gadatas</HI> and affirmed, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for you to &s;tay: alleadging withall, that your father had &s;ent for you. How now, quoth he: What is that you &s;ay? Dur&s;t you indeed utter &s;o much, whether I were willing or no? Yes in troth &s;aid he. For I &s;ee you are exceeding de&s;irous to be &s;eene illu&s;trious in our pro|gre&s;&s;e among the Per&s;ians, yea and to recount unto your father, how you have
<PB N="131" REF="76">atchieved every exploit. And for your &s;elfe, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> have not you a lon|ging, to be gone home? No, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pes:</HI> but here will I abide in qualitie of a Generall, untill I have made this <HI>Gadatas</HI> Lord over the A&s;&s;yri|an King; Thus communed they togither betweene je&s;t and good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Meane-while, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> arrayed in his royall robes, came forth, and &s;ate him downe upon a Throne of State after the Medes fa&s;hion. When all were a&s;&s;em|bled togither whom &s;uch affaires concerned, after &s;ilence made, <HI>Cyaxares</HI> &s;pake in this wi&s;e. My friends and A&s;&s;ociates. Becau&s;e I am here in place and Senior to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> meet peradventure it is that I &s;hould enter into &s;peech fir&s;t. And in my conceit, quoth he, It is now a time convenient, to debate of this point, whether it be expedient &s;till to continue warre, or to di&s;mi&s;&s;e the Armie? Let &s;ome one therefore deliver what he thinketh of this matter? Then, &s;pake the Hyrcanian Potentate to the que&s;tion, fir&s;t. My friends and A&s;&s;ociates, I wote not what need there is of many words, when the very deeds &s;hew what is be&s;t. For, well we all doe know, that remaining together we doe our enemies more harme, than we can receive from them our &s;elves. But, when we were &s;evered a&s;under one from another, then they dealt with us, to their owne greate&s;t plea|&s;ure and our mo&s;t grievous paine. After him the Cadu&s;ian Commaunder opi|ned thus. What &s;hould we &s;peake of departure home, and living there apart; When as even already in this very expedition, they get no good as it is &s;eene, who are disjoyned? For, our owne &s;elves, (when we quartered but a while and &s;erved apart from the body of our whole armie) payed dearely for it and abid the &s;mart, as yee all know well enough. After him <HI>Artabazus;</HI> he who &s;ome|times claimed kinred of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> uttered his opinion in this manner. For mine owne part, &s;aith he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> I doe thus farre forth di&s;&s;ent, from the&s;e who have before me &s;poken to the matter in que&s;tion. For, the&s;e men &s;ay, that wee ought to tarry &s;till here and make warre: but I affirme, that even when I was at home I lived in warfare. For, many a time I came to the re&s;cue, when our goods were harried and carried away. Yea and oftentimes I had employment enough to defend our forts, again&s;t which, traines were laid: whiles I &s;tood in feare, watched and warded, yea and did all this at mine owne charges. But now, I hold their fortre&s;&s;es, and feare them not at all: Nay, I make merry at their co&s;t, I eate and drinke, I &s;ay, of the enemies provi&s;ion. As if therefore our &s;tate at home were a continuall warfare, and this here a very fea&s;t, I am not of the minde to di&s;&s;olve this &s;olemne and generall Celebrity. Next unto him &s;pake <HI>Gobryas.</HI> For my part, good friends and confederates, I commend hither|to the faithfulne&s;&s;e of <HI>Cyrus:</HI> For, he faileth not in the performance of ought that he hath promi&s;ed. But if he be once departed out of this country, evident it is that the A&s;&s;yrian King will bee at re&s;t, and ta&s;t of no puni&s;hment for the wrongs intended again&s;t you and done already unto mee. And I contrariwi&s;e &s;hall be &s;ure to be evill entreated at his hands: becau&s;e I have friended you and become your A&s;&s;ociate. When the&s;e had all delivered their opinions, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;pake in this wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither am I ignorant, my friends, that if wee now breake up campe and di&s;|&s;olve the armie, we &s;hall our &s;elves be in weaker ca&s;e, and our enemies againe in much &s;tronger. For, bee there never &s;o many of them di&s;armed, they will &s;oone cau&s;e other new armour to be made. They that are deprived of their hor&s;es, will quickly after bee deprived of others. And in lieu of them who are
<PB N="132" REF="77">&s;laine, there will &s;pring and grow up eft&s;oone a new &s;upply to &s;ucceed. So that no mervaile will it be, if &s;hortly they put us to new troubles. The ca&s;e &s;tan|ding thus: what meant I to moove <HI>Cyaxares</HI> for to propo&s;e this que&s;tion as tou|ching the di&s;&s;olution of the Armie? Know yee then, quoth he, It was for feare of after-claps. For, I &s;ee tho&s;e enemies ready to encounter us, with whom if we encampe &s;till here, wee &s;hall never bee able to make our parts good in fight. For, the winter commeth on apace. And &s;ay that wee our &s;elves had hou&s;es to put our heads in, yet I a&s;&s;ure you, we want covert for our hor&s;es, for our mini&s;ters and officers, and for the multitude of our common &s;ouldiers: and without the&s;e we cannot po&s;&s;ibly mainteine warre. Againe, the victuals in tho&s;e parts whither we have come, are by us already &s;pent: and where wee have not beene, it is all conveyed away for feare of us, into their &s;trong holds: &s;o that, if the enemies enjoy them, impo&s;&s;ible it is for us to come by the &s;ame. And who is then &s;o valiant, who is there &s;o &s;trong and lu&s;ty, as whiles hee wre&s;teth with hunger and cold, will be able to keepe the field? If therefore wee mu&s;t warre in this manner, I hold this and averre, that we ought rather to di&s;mi&s;&s;e our ar|mie willingly, than for want of meanes to bee driven forth again&s;t our wils. Howbeit, if we be de&s;irous &s;till to lye in campe and continue the warre, This cour&s;e in my advi&s;e wee mu&s;t take, namely, to endevour with all &s;peed to di&s;|&s;eize<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Our ene|mies.</NOTE> them of as many &s;ouldiers of theirs as we can, and to fortifie as many as we may for our &s;elves. For, if this be effected, greater &s;tore of victuall &s;hall they have, who can take more from others, and lay the &s;ame up: be&s;ieged al&s;o and a&s;&s;aulted they &s;hall be who are the weaker. And verily, as now things &s;tand, our ca&s;e is all one with Sea-fearing men. For, they make &s;aile &s;till, and pa&s;&s;e on continually: yet leave they that behinde them which they have &s;ailed through, no more their owne, than that which they have not yet &s;ailed over. Howbeit if we can take in their &s;trong holds and ca&s;tles: the &s;ame will alie|nate the whole country from our enemies: and therewith all things will bee more calme and quiet with us. Now, whereas peradventure &s;ome of you be afraid, le&s;t yee be put to lye in garri&s;on, farre from your native countrey, let not that trouble you. For, how ever wee Per&s;ians u&s;ed to forraine countryes, farre from home, may take in hand to keepe tho&s;e places which be next unto our enemies: yet, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e yee and occupie the while tho&s;e parts of A&s;&s;yria which border hard upon you. For, if we &s;hall be &s;ufficient to hold tho&s;e mar|ches &s;afely that be neere&s;t unto them, yee that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the quarters farthe&s;t from them, &s;hall live in much re&s;t and peace. For, in my conceit, they &s;hall never be able, neglecting their owne harmes and daungers hard at their doores, to lay wait and practi&s;e again&s;t you &s;o farre di&s;tant. When the&s;e rea&s;ons were &s;et downe, all the re&s;t ro&s;e up, &s;aying they would be willing, &s;o to doe. Yea and <HI>Cyaxares</HI> him&s;elfe did no le&s;&s;e. <HI>Gadatas</HI> al&s;o and <HI>Gobryas,</HI> both the one and the other promi&s;ed, if their Allies would give them leave to fortifie their holds, to the end that the &s;ame al&s;o might be unto their &s;aid A&s;&s;ociates friend|ly and helpefull.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> then, &s;eeing them all, pre&s;t to performe what&s;oever he had &s;aid, in the end concluded thus. If therefore, quoth he, we be fully minded to accompli&s;h all that we &s;ay, then there mu&s;t be done with all expedition that which is need|full, namely; we are to make fabricks and engins, to beat downe our enemies walles and fortifications: provided wee ought to be of Carpenters and other
<PB N="133" REF="77">workemen to rai&s;e towers and bulwarks for our &s;elves. Then <HI>Cyaxares</HI> promi|&s;ed for his part to finde one fabricke for the &s;aid purpo&s;e. <HI>Gadatas</HI> and <HI>Gobryas</HI> another: <HI>Tigranes</HI> al&s;o a third; <HI>Cyrus</HI> likewi&s;e for him&s;elfe, &s;aid he would take order for another. The&s;e de&s;ignes being thus decreed, they got unto him the &s;aid workemen and enginers, and every man provided &s;uch things as were re|qui&s;ite for tho&s;e workes. Yea, and &s;uch men were appointed over&s;eers for the worke, as were thought meete&s;t for tho&s;e purpo&s;es. As for <HI>Cyrus,</HI> perceiving that the performance of the&s;e matters required time, kept his &s;tanding Campe in a place which he tooke to be for health right hol&s;ome, and for the carriage and bringing in of all things nece&s;&s;ary, mo&s;t pa&s;&s;able. And what&s;oever needed defen&s;e, he ordered the matter &s;o, that if at any time they encamped far off, with the maine armie, tho&s;e that remaine behind might ever be in &s;afetie. Moreover, enquiring of tho&s;e whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have be&s;t knowledge of the country, from what parts his armie might get greate&s;t commoditie, thither he led forth evermore a foraging: thereby partly to provide all things nece&s;&s;ary for the ho&s;t in greate&s;t plentie, and in part that his &s;ouldiers being exerci&s;ed in &s;uch jour|nies, might the better &s;tand to health and gather more &s;trength: and withall in their convoyes be put in minde to keepe their ranks in array. Thus <HI>Cyrus</HI> im|ployed him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>Now there were certeine fugitives from Babylon and captives, who gave in|telligence, that the A&s;&s;yrian King was gone into Lydia, and had conveyed with him many talents of &s;ilver and gold, be&s;ides great riches otherwi&s;e and furni|ture of all kinds. Whereupon the common &s;ort and multitude of the &s;ouldi|ers &s;uppo&s;ed and gave it our, that for very feare he now remooved and carryed his goods-away. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> knowing full well, that hee departed for this in|tent, to &s;ollicite and excite, if po&s;&s;ibly he could &s;ome oppo&s;ites to make head a|gain&s;t him, prepared and made him&s;elfe &s;trong, re&s;olute to encounter him, as making no other reckoning yet, but to fight it our. And verily to this purpo&s;e, he made up the full companies of the Per&s;ian Cavallarie; taking &s;ome hor&s;es at his pri&s;oners hands, others, of his friends. For, &s;uch things as the&s;e he recei|ved of all, neither rejected he ought that any one gave him, were it a faire ar|mour, or a goodly Cour&s;er. Furthermore, he provided him&s;elfe of Chariots, both out of that &s;tore which he had taken from the enemie, and el&s;e-where al&s;o as hee could. As for the old Trojane manner of chariots u&s;ed aforetime, as al&s;o the Cyrenaicks fa&s;hion of driving, which they u&s;e even at this day, he did quite put downe. For, in times pa&s;t, the Medes, Syrians and Arabi|ans, yea all tho&s;e in A&s;ia generally u&s;ed their chariots &s;o, as at this day the Cy|renians doe. Now was <HI>Cyrus</HI> of this opinion, that the be&s;t part, by all rea&s;on and likelihood, of the armie (con&s;idering that the brave&s;t and mo&s;t valiant men, u&s;e to be mounted in chariots) is but in the nature of light skirmi&s;hers with &s;hot, before the battaile, and for the atchiving of victory &s;tand in &s;mall &s;tead. For, three hundred chariots, yeeld not above three hundred fighting men, but require 1200 Steeds. To guide al&s;o and to rule the &s;ame, (&s;uch men as by good rea&s;on they tru&s;t mo&s;t, who are the very flowre of the armie) they have 300 be&s;ide. And the&s;e are they, that doe no hurt at all unto their enemies. This manner therefore of charioting he aboli&s;hed: and in lieu thereof, devi&s;ed to make chariots fit for warre, with &s;trong wheeles, becau&s;e they &s;hould not quickly breake, and with long axelltrees. For, that all things are the harder to
<PB N="134" REF="78">be overturned that<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> carry a good breadth. He made al&s;o for the drivers a &s;eate in manner of a turret, of &s;trong quarters of timber, the height whereof raught up to their elbowes: to the end that the Steeds might be ruled by them &s;itting upon their &s;eats. The&s;e drivers he armed at all pieces throughout &s;ave onely their eyes. Moreover, he fa&s;tened to the axeltrees on both &s;ides of the wheeles, certeine yron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or &s;ithes. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> hooks two cubits long: be&s;ides others under the very axel-tree to the groundward: as if they meant even with the chariots to charge upon the enemies. And like as <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, devi&s;ed and made the&s;e chariots, &s;o even in the&s;e our dayes, they that are under the dominion of the King u&s;e the &s;ame. <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o had many Camels gathered togither, &s;uch as he could get of his friends, be&s;ide all tho&s;e that were taken from the enemies. And thus verily fini&s;hed he the&s;e things.</P>

<P>CYRVS now being de&s;irous to &s;end a certeine Spie into Lydia, and to learne what the King of A&s;&s;yria did, thought <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> to bee a meet man, for to negotiate in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: him I meane, who had the kee|ping of that faire Lady <HI>[Panthea.]</HI> For, unto this <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> &s;uch like employ|ments u&s;ually had befalne. Who, being &s;urpri&s;ed with the love of that Gentle|woman, was forced to breake with her about the &s;ame, and de&s;ired her carnall companie. But &s;hee denyed and rejected his &s;uit, keeping her &s;elfe true unto her owne husband; for &s;hee loved him entirely. Yet complained &s;hee not of <HI>A|ra&s;pas</HI> unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as one very loth to &s;et two friends at difference. But <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ing it would make much to the obteining of that which hee longed af|ter) menaced the woman, that if &s;hee condi&s;cended not willingly unto him, &s;hee &s;hould doe it again&s;t her will: whereupon the woman fearing violence, concealed the thing no longer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or Chamber|laine. <GAP DESC="foreign">. Ara&s;pas.</NOTE> but di&s;patched her * Eunuch unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> com|maunding him to reveale the whole matter. Which when he heard, he &s;et up a laughter at * him for making &s;uch brags, that he was able to conquer love, and therewith &s;ent <HI>Artabazus</HI> backe with the Eunuch, willing him to deliver unto <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> this me&s;&s;age, that in any wi&s;e he &s;hould not force the woman; but per|&s;wade and winne her if he could, and in &s;o doing he would not be his hindrance. But <HI>Artabazus,</HI> when hee was come unto <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> all to rated and reviled him, charging him with this, that the Lady was committed unto his cu&s;todie upon tru&s;t: and laying upon him the imputation of impietie, injury and incontinency: in&s;omuch, as <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> for very griefe of heart wept &s;ore, for &s;hame hid him&s;elfe, and for feare al&s;o of &s;ome hard mea&s;ure from <HI>Cyrus,</HI> was in manner out of the world. Which when <HI>Cyrus</HI> under&s;tood, hee both &s;ent for him, and al&s;o when they were by them&s;elves alone, u&s;ed the&s;e words unto him. I &s;ee, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> that you are afraid of mee and exceeding much a&s;hamed: But give o|ver and make an end once: For, I have heard &s;ay, that the very Gods them&s;elves have beene overcome of love, and I know what accidents have befalne unto men reputed very wi&s;e, by occa&s;ion of this pa&s;&s;ion. Yea, and thus much have I noted and blamed in my &s;elfe, that I am not &s;o continent, but if I conver&s;ed
<PB N="135" REF="78">with tho&s;e that are faire and beautifull, I de&s;pi&s;e them not. Nay, that which more is, I my &s;elfe am the cau&s;e of all this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: For, I was he that immu|red you up, as it were,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. or inco~parable.</NOTE> with this inexpugnable thing. Vnto the&s;e words of his <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> made this an&s;were. Now &s;urely, quoth he &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you are in this par|ticular like unto your &s;elfe, and as in all other ca&s;es the &s;ame &s;till, to wit, mild and ready to pardon mens tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. But other men there be, that overwhelme and oppre&s;&s;e me with griefe. For, ever &s;ince that this my adver&s;e hap and cala|mitie was bruted abroad, mine enemies take their plea&s;ure of mee: but my friends, comming about me, give me coun&s;ell to withdraw my &s;elfe out of the way, lea&s;t I might be hardly entreated at your hands, as one whom I have much wronged and abu&s;ed. Know this well therefore, &ocirc; <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that by this opinion which men have conceived, you may doe mee a high plea&s;ure, and withall greatly profit our A&s;&s;ociates. Would to God &s;aid <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> it lay in my power any wayes to doe you acceptable &s;ervice. Why! quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> If you would now make &s;emblance, as though you fled from me and &s;o goe to the enemies, I am verily per&s;waded, you might be credited of them. And I a&s;&s;ure you of my troth, and as God &s;hall helpe mee, &s;aid <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> even my very friends would rai&s;e &s;uch a rumour, as if in deed I had made an e&s;cape from you. So by this meanes, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you may returne againe unto us with the full intelligence of all our enemies affaires. I &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, that being once tru&s;ted among them; they will make you privie to all their &s;peeches and &s;ecret coun&s;els what&s;oever: in &s;o much as there &s;hall no de&s;ignment be hid from you, that we are de&s;irous to learne. Well then, quoth <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> I will even now &s;et forward. For, this, you may well wit, will be one argument to induce them for to believe me, becau&s;e I &s;hall be thought to have run away from you, fea|ring &s;ome mi&s;chiefe at your hands. But, can you, by the way, finde in your heart, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to leave that &s;ame lovely [Dame] <HI>Panthea</HI> behind you? Cerres, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I have in me two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or minde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> &s;oules. For, even erewhile of that point I philo&s;ophized, and argued with an untoward Sophi&s;ter, namely, love. For, were the &s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or minde.</NOTE> &s;oule of mine but one, it could not be for both good &amp; bad at once: neither could it affect at one and the &s;ame time, as well hone&s;t actions as di&s;hone&s;t: ne yet be willing and unwilling alike to effect the &s;ame. But evi|dent it is, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, &s;oules.</NOTE> two minds there are: And when that which is good hath the &s;overaintie, hone&s;t deeds are enterpri&s;ed and done: but when the bad hath the ma&s;tery, wee &s;et in hand with tho&s;e that are di&s;hone&s;t and naught. And now this good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, minde.</NOTE> under&s;tanding in me having gotten your helpe and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is be|come &s;uperiour and ruleth very much. If therefore, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you al&s;o thinke it good to take this journey, you mu&s;t order the matter &s;o, as that you may winne the greater credit and reputation among them. To which purpo&s;e, di&s;co|ver hardly unto them what we are about: and di&s;cover it &s;o, as what plots &s;o ever you di&s;clo&s;e unto them, may be the greate&s;t lets to checke and cro&s;&s;e their owne de&s;ignments and proceedings. Now, this would be a blocke in their way, in ca&s;e you give it out, that we are preparing, and upon the point in &s;ome place or other to invade their Land. For, when they heare this, they can the wor&s;e be a&s;&s;embled all togither with their whole pui&s;&s;ance, whiles every one &s;tandeth in feare for his owne e&s;tate at home. And &s;tay you with them as long as you may. For, it will be mo&s;t availeable unto us, to have intelligence e&s;pecially of tho&s;e enterpri&s;es that they goe about, even when they are neere&s;t unto us.
<PB N="136" REF="79">Furthermore, advi&s;e them to put them&s;elves in ordinance of battaile, the be&s;t way that &s;hall be thought.

<P>NOw, when [Dame] <HI>Panthea</HI> under&s;tood that <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> was gone, &s;hee di&s;patched unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> a me&s;&s;enger, in her name, thus to &s;ay. Let it not trouble you <HI>Cyrus</HI> that <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> is turned to the enemies &s;ide: For, if you will give me leave to &s;end unto my husband, I undertake that hee &s;hall come a more faithfull friend by farre than was <HI>Ara&s;pas.</HI> And I know moreover, that he will be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t you with all the power that hee is able to make. For, this mans father who now is King, was his very good friend: how&s;oever he that reigneth at this pre&s;ent, went about once when it was, to make a di&s;traction and &s;eparation betweene me and my husband. And therefore, I know right well, that taking him to be, as he is, &s;pitefull and malicious, he will be glad to turne unto &s;uch a Prince as you are. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard this, he commaunded her to &s;end unto her husband; which &s;he did accordingly. Then <HI>Abradatas</HI> as &s;oone as he tooke knowledge of the tokens that came from his wife, and under&s;tood be&s;ides how other things went, willingly with all &s;peed went unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> with a troupe of 2000. hor&s;e or thereabout. And being come as farre as to the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Sentinels.</NOTE> E&s;pials, he &s;ent unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;ignifying who he was. Whereupon <HI>Cyrus</HI> gave order &s;treightwaies, that hee &s;hould be conducted directly to his wife. Now when &s;he and <HI>Abradatas</HI> her husband had &s;eene one another, they mutually em|braced each other, as rea&s;on it was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> meeting thus beyond all hope. Then, <HI>Pan|thea</HI> reported unto him the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Integrity.</NOTE> piety, temperance and commi&s;eration of <HI>Cyrus</HI> to|ward her: Which <HI>Abradatas</HI> hearing: What were I be&s;t to doe, my <HI>Panthea,</HI> quoth he, to requite <HI>Cyrus,</HI> both in your behalfe and in mine owne al&s;o? What el&s;e &s;aid <HI>Panthea,</HI> but endeavour to beate your &s;elfe toward him &s;o, as hee hath beene to you ward? After this, went <HI>Abradatas</HI> to <HI>Cyrus:</HI> and no &s;ooner &s;aw he him, but taking him by the right hand, thus he &s;aid: For the favours you have done unto us &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I know not what to &s;ay more than this, That I will de|vote my &s;elfe wholly unto you, as a friend, &s;ervitour and A&s;&s;ociat in warre. And what&s;oever I &s;ee you &s;tudiou&s;ly to affect, therein &s;hall I doe my be&s;t devoir to effect the &s;ame. Why! then quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I accept of you: and now for this time I di&s;mi&s;&s;e you, to go and &s;up togither with your wife. But henceforth, you mu&s;t lodge even in mine owne Pavilion with your Friends and mine.</P>
<P>Afterwards when <HI>Abradatas</HI> perceived <HI>Cyrus</HI> to &s;et his mind earne&s;tly upon
<PB N="137" REF="79">tho&s;e &s;ythed chariots: to affect likewi&s;e bard hor&s;es and hor&s;emen armed at all pieces, he endeavoured out of his owne Cavallery to provide him an hundred chariots, with the like equipage to his: yea and addre&s;&s;e him&s;elfe in per&s;on to ride in a chariot, as Captaine to governe the re&s;t. As for his owne chariot, hee ordered it &s;o, that it had foure &s;pires, and eight &s;teeds drew joyntly therein. His wife <HI>Panthea</HI> out of her owne privy pur&s;e, had made for him both a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Poles.</NOTE> curet and al&s;o an helmet of beaten gold: likewi&s;e a paire of golden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Curace.</NOTE> Vambraces.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> As for the hor&s;es belonging to his chariot, &s;he did &s;et them out with furnitures and harni&s;h all of bra&s;&s;e onely. Thus verily was <HI>Abradatus</HI> bu&s;ied. But <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when hee had &s;eene his &s;aid Chariot with foure poles, thought this with him|&s;elfe; that he likewi&s;e might as well deui&s;e one al&s;o of eight, &s;o as the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Towers.</NOTE> nether|mo&s;t rowne for engins, might bee drawne with a teem of eight yoke of oxen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Story.</NOTE> Now, tooke this Chariot with wheeles and all,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> three fathome at the mo&s;t from the ground. That &s;uch turrets as the&s;e &s;hould follow with the maine bat|taile,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> he thought might be a great helpe to his owne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Phalanx.</NOTE> troupe and no le&s;&s;e anoi|ance to the enemies battaile.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Galleries.</NOTE> Vpon the&s;e fore&s;aid rownes he made round com|pa&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or turret-like.</NOTE> lofts with their battlements, and in every &s;uch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">wagon or chariot.</NOTE> turret he be&s;towed 20. fighting men. Now when hee had fini&s;hed all that belonged to the&s;e &s;aid tur|rets, he made triall of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or load.</NOTE> Draught: and he found by proufe, that eight yoke would draw a turret with all the &s;oldiers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or in it.</NOTE> upon it, much more ea&s;ily than each yoke the ordinary lode of &s;tuffe and baggage. For there was commonly char|ged upon a &s;ingle yoke, as much as weighed about 25. talents: Whereas in a turret drawne after this manner, (the timber carrying the thickne&s;&s;e of a tragi|call Pageant, with 20. &s;ouldiers in it, and armour be&s;ides) the draught came to le&s;&s;e in proportion than 15. talents for every yoke. When he perceived there|fore, that the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or carrying.</NOTE> draught was &s;o ea&s;ie, he provided to bring the&s;e turrets togither with his armie, again&s;t the enemies.

<P>Which newes when <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard, Why! then, quoth he, I charge all the re&s;t of you, to abide here in tho&s;e tents which you have taken up already; there, to have the cu&s;todie of the &s;aid money, and to live at your mo&s;t plea&s;ure: onely

Wherein, if yee doe me good &s;ervice, I will take my &s;elfe more beholden unto you and give you greater thankes, than for the trea&s;ure which yee have brought unto me. For, the&s;e common<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Intellige~cers.</NOTE> Spies, in forme of &s;laves, can learne and report no other thing but what all men know: Whereas, &s;uch men as yee are, in quality of Emba&s;&s;adors, doe many times come to the intelligence even of their &s;ecret projects al&s;o. The <HI>Indians</HI> having heard this right gladly, and beene for that time courteou&s;ly intertained and rewarded by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> did put them&s;elves in readine&s;&s;e, and the next day &s;et forward on their journey; promi&s;ing upon their fidelity, that when they had learned what they could of the enemies, they would repaire againe unto him with all &s;peed po&s;&s;i|ble. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> verily (as he was a man who projected no &s;mall enterpri&s;es) pro|vided all things for the warre magnificently. Neither tooke he order for &s;uch matters onely, as his Allies thought meet, but al&s;o kindled an aemulation a|mong his Friends: who might &s;hew them&s;elves in their armour mo&s;t gallant, in hor&s;man&s;hip mo&s;t skilfull, in darting and &s;hooting mo&s;t cunning, and in tra|vaile mo&s;t painfull? And the&s;e feats wrought he, what by training them forth to hunting, and what by gracing and rewarding the be&s;t in every kind. Such Captaines al&s;o and Rulers, as he &s;aw mo&s;t &s;tudious and carefull in this point, that their &s;ouldiers &s;hould prove right expert and valiant, &s;uch I &s;ay, he did put forward and embolden, as well by prai&s;ing, as by gratifying them in what&s;o|ever he could. And if at any time he &s;acrificed, or kept &s;ome fe&s;tivall holiday, he would then &s;et forth and exhibit &s;ome games of price, re&s;pective to all tho&s;e feats which men practi&s;e for the u&s;e of warre. Yea and to the victour hee gave rewards mo&s;t magnificently. So that much joy and mirth there was throughout his armie.</P>
<P>And now by this time were all things in manner fini&s;hed, which he minded to u&s;e in his expedition, &s;aving onely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Artillery.</NOTE> engins. For the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> hor&s;emen were growne already to the compleat number of 10. thou&s;and: of &s;ithed chariots, that him&s;elfe had provided, there were full one hundred: and of others that <HI>A|bradatas</HI> the <HI>Su&s;ian</HI> tooke in hand to make, according to the patterne of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his chariots, there were as many. Moreover, <HI>Cyrus</HI> had per&s;waded <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> to chaunge his <HI>Median</HI> chariots, from the <HI>Trojane</HI> and <HI>Lybian</HI> fa&s;hion: and to make them after his owne. Of which &s;ort al&s;o there was a third hundred. Further|more, for the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dromedaries.</NOTE> Camels, were &s;ouldiers appointed to &s;erve upon them: for every one two archers. And the mo&s;t part of his armie carried this mind, as if they had wonne the victorie already, and as if the enemies were of no worth. Now when as they &s;tood thus affected and appointed: after that the <HI>Indians</HI> al&s;o whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;ent to di&s;cover, were returned from the enemies, and related how <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> was elected the Generall and Conductor of all their forces: How it was decreed by all the Confederate KK. that every one &s;hould be pre&s;ent with all his pui&s;&s;ance, and bring with him great &s;tore of money, to &s;erve partly for to wage as many as they could levie, and partly to be&s;tow by way of large&s;&s;e up|on &s;uch as need required: Moreover, that many <HI>Thracians</HI> wearing &s;words by their &s;ides were already hired: and <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> to the number of an hundred and twenty thou&s;and were under &s;aile, and tho&s;e armed with &s;hields reaching down to their feet, and great ma&s;&s;ie &s;peares, &s;uch as they u&s;e even at this day, and long

Hee gave his owne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Serjeants.</NOTE> mini&s;ters about him al&s;o to under&s;tand, that if any other &s;ouldiers bearing armes were de&s;irous to draw neere, and heare what &s;peech he would make, they &s;hould not prohibit or keep them backe.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> The oration of <HI>Cyrus</HI> unto his &s;ouldiours to put them out of that feare and astoni&s;hment, which they had conceived of the newes they heard as touching the warre toward.</HEAD>
<P>MY Friends and Allies, I have called you togither, becau&s;e I &s;aw &s;ome of you (upon the newes arrived from the enemies) farre like unto men affraied. And I mervaile much, I a&s;&s;ure you, that any of you &s;hould be affrighted, for that the report goes that our enemies are gathered togither: e&s;pecially, &s;eeing that we our &s;elves be a&s;&s;embled now many more in number, than heretofore, when wee gave them an overthrow: and are be&s;ides through Gods favour and grace, farre better appointed at this pre&s;ent, than ever before. A wonder it is, I &s;ay, that when you &s;ee all this, yee are not bold and courage|ous. Oh the will of God, if yee be &s;mitten now with feare, what would yee have done, in ca&s;e &s;ome had brought newes, that tho&s;e meanes which make for us had bin bent and brought again&s;t us: If, I &s;ay, ye had heard, Fir&s;t and formo&s;t, that they who beforetime di&s;comfited us made head againe, as carrying in mind &s;till that victory which once they had atchieved: then, that they, who at that time defaited the velitary fight and skirmi&s;h of Archers and Iaveletiers, entred
<PB N="140" REF="81">now eft&s;oones the field, and brought with them many more, and tho&s;e equall to them&s;elves. Againe, if word had come, that like as the&s;e being in compleat ar|mour overcame the footmen then, &s;o their hor&s;emen now were comming throughly appointed again&s;t our men of armes, and abandoning bowes [ar|rowes] and javelins, taking every man to his &s;trong launce, advanced forward and rode on with full intent to cope hand to hand. Semblably, that there be chariots comming, which are not to be &s;o placed, (as heretofore) turned back|ward as ready to &s;erve for flight: but as well the hor&s;es in the teeme drawing, be bard and armed with bre&s;t-plates, as the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Drivers.</NOTE> chariotiers which &s;tand in within turrets of tymber, have all their upper parts which are &s;eene, defended &s;ure with cuiraces and morrions: al&s;o that trenchant &s;ythes of yron are fitted fa&s;t to the axel-trees: to the end that the&s;e al&s;o may drive directly and in a moment forci|bly a&s;&s;aile the ranks of tho&s;e who affront them. Be&s;ides all this, that they have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dromedaries.</NOTE> Camels, upon which they may ride forward and give the on&s;et; bea&s;ts &s;o hi|deous, as that an hundred hor&s;e will not abide to &s;ee one of them. Furthermore, that they march on, with turrets, from whence they will bee ready to helpe their owne &s;ide, and to annoy you with darting, &s;o as yee &s;hall not be able to fight on even ground. In ca&s;e, I &s;ay, one &s;hould tell you who are affraied alrea|dy, that our enemies had all the&s;e meanes; what would yee doe then, being &s;o troubled now as yee are with the&s;e flying rumours? That <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> is elected Ge|nerall of their Field; a man, &s;o much more cowardly than the <HI>Syrians,</HI> as that when they were in battaile foyled and put to flight, he &s;eeing them vanqui&s;hed whom hee ought to have &s;uccoured as his A&s;&s;ociats, ran him&s;elfe away and e&s;|caped. And be&s;ides all this, it is verily bruited: that our very enemies thinke not their owne forces &s;ufficient to joyne battaile with us, but hire others, as if they would doe better &s;ervice for them in the field, than their owne &s;elves. The ca&s;e &s;tanding thus, If there be any that thinke the enemies condition pui&s;&s;ant and the meanes they have terrible: but contrariwi&s;e our owne to be &s;light and of no validity, &s;uch men I &s;ay, my friends, are meet to have their pa&s;&s;e and to be &s;ent away unto our enemies. For, being there, they will &s;tead us better than if they were &s;till with us.</P>
<P>When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had thus &s;aid, <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> that <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lord, &s;tood up and &s;pake thus. Mervaile not &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> if &s;ome hearing the&s;e newes which are reported, have &s;eemed &s;ad and heavy of countenance. For, it was not upon any feare, that they looked &s;o but even for very griefe and indignation: Faring like to tho&s;e, who de&s;irous and making full accompt to goe to their dinners, have &s;ome worke impo&s;ed upon them, which mu&s;t needs be done before they dine. And no man will be glad I &s;uppo&s;e, to heare of that. For, even &s;o it is with us: Who reckoning now to be in the way of getting great wealth, after wee under&s;tood, that there was a piece of &s;ervice yet to bee performed, looked heavily on the matter, not for any feare, but de&s;irous rather that the &s;ame were atchieved al|ready. Howbeit, con&s;idering that we &s;hall fight, not onely for <HI>Syria,</HI> which hath plenty of corne, &s;tore of cattell and abundance of fruitfull Datetrees: but al&s;o for <HI>Lydia,</HI> wherein there is affluence of wine, figgs and oyle: unto which the &s;ea floweth, whereby more goods are brought than any man hath ever &s;eene. We thinking, I &s;ay, of the&s;e matters, are no longer di&s;contented, but mo&s;t confi|dent and re&s;olute: that we may the &s;ooner enjoy al&s;o the&s;e <HI>Lydian</HI> commodities. The&s;e words delivered hee: Wherewith all the united A&s;&s;ociats were well
<PB N="141" REF="81">plea&s;ed, and commended the &s;ame. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I am of this mind my wor|thy friends, with all expedition to march on again&s;t them: For, fir&s;t by our &s;o|daine comming, wee may prevent and &s;urpri&s;e them even in tho&s;e very places where they are getting their provi&s;ion: then, the &s;ooner that wee come upon them, the fewer nece&s;&s;aries about them &s;hall we find in readine&s;&s;e, and the more wanting. This verily is mine opinion. Yet if there be any among you of ano|ther judgement, thinking wee may take &s;ome cour&s;e be&s;ides, either &s;afer or more ea&s;ie, let him &s;hew the &s;ame. Now when many there were who accorded, and &s;aid it was nece&s;&s;arie, with all celerity to march again&s;t the enemies, and not one replied to the contrary, <HI>Cyrus</HI> began his oration unto them, to this effect.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> The In&s;truction of <HI>Cyrus</HI> delivered unto his Chieftaines as well concerning their &s;ouldiers diet, as the conduct of an army in their march through the country. The order of the Pioners, merchants and trades-men, artizanes and munitioners.</HEAD>
<P>MY Friends and Confederates, Our hears, our bodies, our armour al&s;o which we are to u&s;e, be long &s;ince, prai&s;ed be God, in readine&s;&s;e. And now we ought to purvey and get together our voiage-victuals and o|ther nece&s;&s;aries both for our &s;elves and for the bea&s;ts wee employ in our &s;er|vice, and that for no le&s;&s;e time than 20. daies. For, by ca&s;ting my accompt I find, that we mu&s;t be in our march forward more than 15. In which journey we &s;hall meet with nothing. For, all the provi&s;ion is quite con&s;umed, partly by our &s;elves and partly by our enemies, as much as po&s;&s;ibly they could come by. And therefore, gotten there would bee togither, meate &s;ufficient, as without which we can neither fight no nor live at all. As for wine, wee mu&s;t every one have as much as may &s;erve to acquaint us to the drinking of water. For why? The greater part of the way which we are to travell is altogither without wine. And &s;ay, wee &s;hould for our journey provide good &s;tore thereof, yet would it not hold out. To the end therefore that by a &s;udden default of it, wee fall not into &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, this order wee are to take. Let us even at the fir&s;t begin to drinke water with our meat: Which if we now doe, we &s;hall find no great alte|ration. For, who&s;oever feedeth upon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">made or bar|ley meale.</NOTE> thicke gruell, he alwaies eateth it in man|ner of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Graec&egrave;, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> batter tempered with water: and he that lives upon bread, eateth that bread &s;oked in water. Moreover, there are no boyled meates but the &s;ame bee dre&s;&s;ed commonly with much water. If then, after our meale and repa&s;t onely we drinke wine, our minds will re&s;t as well contented. But in proce&s;&s;e of time, we mu&s;t cut off even that wine al&s;o after &s;upper, untill by u&s;e and cu&s;tome wee have learned to be water-drinkers altogither. For the&s;e chaunges that are made by little and little cau&s;e nature to brooke and abide every alteration. And veri|ly this is it that God him&s;elfe teacheth us: Who withdraweth us from the chilling cold of winter, to endure the parching heat of &s;ummer: and from the hote &s;ummer to abide the &s;harpe winter. By imitation of whom, we mu&s;t be enured long before to that which we ought to attaine unto. As for the weight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, your bed|ding.</NOTE> of your bed-clothes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> be&s;tow all that upon your victuals. For,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> in ca&s;e ye have
<PB N="142" REF="82">of victuals to &s;pare, yet will it not be lo&s;t or good for nothing: and &s;uppo&s;e yee want &s;uch clothes, feare ye not but for all that yee &s;hall &s;leepe &s;weetly. If not, blame me for it. Now for wearing-clothes, who&s;oever he be that hath &s;tore thereof, know he that it helpeth both &s;ound and &s;icke. And as touching<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ates be|&s;ide bread, al&s;o, &s;auces.</NOTE> meats and viands, there ought to be provided &s;uch as be for the mo&s;t part, &s;harp, tart, biting and &s;alti&s;h. For the&s;e, as they provoke appetite, &s;o withall they la&s;t lon|ge&s;t: But when we are come to tho&s;e places which have not yet beene &s;poy|led, and where is &s;ome likelihood that we &s;hall get corne, provided we mu&s;t be from thenceforth of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> handmils to make our bread. For, of all informents that belong to bread making, that is the lighte&s;t. Moreover we ought to have ready about us, all &s;uch things as &s;icke men need. For, tho&s;e be of boulke and burden the lea&s;t: but if there &s;hould be &s;uch occa&s;ion, they would be mi&s;&s;ed mo&s;t. Fur|thermore, wee mu&s;t be provided of leather thongs. For many things by the&s;e are tied and fa&s;tned both to men and hor&s;es, which if they bee overworne or fretted in twaine, we mu&s;t needs be at a default, and do nothing the while, un|le&s;&s;e a man have &s;uch letherings, wanties or &s;urcingles. Againe, if there be any one of you can skill of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">furbu&s;hing.</NOTE> poli&s;hing his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Speare or chacing &s;taffe or launce.</NOTE> Iavelin, it were good for him not to forget a skratcher or gre&s;&s;er. It were well al&s;o that he carry with him a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">for the &s;taffe.</NOTE> fyle. For, hee that whetteth his launce head, giveth an edge al&s;o in &s;ome &s;ort to his owne heart and courage. And the man that &s;harpneth his &s;peare, would him&s;elfe be a&s;hamed for to bee a coward. Over and be&s;ides, meet it is to have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">as quarters, &amp;c.</NOTE> peeces of wood, in the wagons and waines. For, where much doing is, it cannot otherwi&s;e be but many things will decay and be wor&s;e for the wearing. There would be proper tooles likewi&s;e had, and in&s;truments, needfull for all the&s;e purpo&s;es: be|cau&s;e artificers and handicraft&s;men are not in all places to be gotten. For, even to make that onely which is to &s;erve for a day, &s;ome few are not able. We mu&s;t have be&s;ides to every cart or waine a mattocke and a &s;pade: and to each packe|hor&s;e, an axe, a bill [or a cutting hooke.] For, the&s;e in&s;truments be not onely nece&s;&s;arie for every mans private u&s;e, but profitable many times in publike oc|ca&s;ions. Well then, what&s;oever is requi&s;ite for food and &s;u&s;tenance, yee that are the leaders of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or porters.</NOTE> armour-bearers, &s;ee that yee enquire of tho&s;e that be under you. And regard mu&s;t be had, that nothing be forgotten which any one wan|teth. For need we &s;hall have of &s;uch. As for all tho&s;e things, which I commaund that the draught bea&s;ts &s;hould have, yee that are the Ma&s;ters of the Carriages, with the bag and baggage &s;ee thereto: and looke who hath not the &s;ame, com|pell them to provide. Yee that be over&s;eers of the Pioners, for making of the waies even and pa&s;&s;able before the army, have already for that purpo&s;e, tho&s;e that I enrolled, to wit, out of the darters, archers and &s;lingers, &s;uch as I ca&s;&s;ed and put out of their places. And therefore, tho&s;e of the late darters, yee &s;hall enforce in this warfare to doe &s;ervice with an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or pitching axe.</NOTE> hewing axe for to cut wood: &s;uch as were archers, put them to &s;erve with a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or &s;houle.</NOTE> &s;pade, and the &s;lingers with a mattocke. The&s;e Pioners then thus furni&s;hed, yee mu&s;t compell to goe before the waines by &s;everall troups togither, that if there bee cau&s;e to make wayes and cau&s;ies, yee may pre&s;ently goe to worke: and that my &s;elfe, if I need any mens helpe, may know from whence to fetch them for my u&s;e. I will have al&s;o with me copper-&s;miths, and black-&s;miths, carpenters and &s;hoomakers [or leather-cutters] with their tooles, &s;uch as be of full age for warfare: to the end there be no want of ought that requires the help of &s;uch artificers in an armie.
<PB N="143" REF="82">And the&s;e verily &s;hall be freed and exempt from the raunge of armour-bearers, and having a certaine place appointed for them &s;hall according to their skill &s;erve all commers, for their money. Furthermore if there be any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Trade&s;-men.</NOTE> merchant di&s;po&s;ed to follow the camp, minding to &s;ell any wares and commodities, let him have allowance of victuall, during tho&s;e 20. dayes [before named] but in ca&s;e he be found &s;elling ought el&s;e in that time, hee &s;hall forfeit and lo&s;e all he hath. But after the&s;e dayes be expired, he may fell what he will at his plea|&s;ure. And looke which of all the&s;e merchants or trade&s;men, is knowne to fur|ni&s;h the mercate be&s;t with wares of all &s;orts, hee &s;hall both at my hands and mine Allies al&s;o be be&s;t rewarded and advanced. Now, if any &s;uch per&s;on think|eth that hee wants money to merchandize and trade with, let him bring unto me &s;uch as know him well, and &s;ureties to be bound and to undertake for him, that he will goe with the armie, he may take what we have in our coffers. Thus doe I punctually deliver my mind and profe&s;&s;e the &s;ame. And if any man &s;eeth ought el&s;e, that is requi&s;ite and needfull to be done, let him acquaint me there|with. As for you, goe your waies and get togither your bag and baggage, whiles I &s;acrifice for our happy out-fare. And when our devotions &s;hall be well per|formed, wee will give you the &s;ignall. And let every man bee ready with the premi&s;es at a place appointed under their owne colours. And yee that are the Leaders, when yee haue put your Company in array, &s;hall repaire all to me, that yee may each one take his &s;everall place.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> marched again&s;t his enemies in <HI>Lydia.</HI> The manner he u&s;ed as well in encamping, as in leading his whole Armie.</HEAD>
<P>CYRVS then &s;acrificed: and for that the inwards of the bea&s;ts &s;hewed good lucke, he did put him&s;elfe on the way with his armie. The fir&s;t day, he pitched his tents in the neere&s;t place he could find: to this end, that if any man had forgotten ought, he might goe backe for it; or if he found that he wanted any thing he might provide it. And <HI>Cyaxares</HI> verily &s;taied at home in <HI>Media,</HI> with the third part of his <HI>Medes,</HI> becau&s;e his countrey &s;hould not bee disfurni&s;hed of &s;ouldiers: but <HI>Cyrus</HI> went forward, with as &s;wift a march as po&s;|&s;ibly he could. In the vaward he placed his hor&s;emen: and before them, he &s;ent out alwaies certaine avantcurriers and &s;pies, into the coa&s;ts and quarters lying forward, &s;uch as were meete&s;t to di&s;cover. Next after them, he led the carria|ges. But when he came into any plaine and open ground, he made many ranks and rowes of wagons and carriages. Behind the&s;e, followed a great battalion of footmen, raunged foure &s;quare, to the end that if any carriage dragged behind, &s;uch Captaines thereof as came formo&s;t and e&s;pied them, might &s;ee to it, that they were not hindred and &s;topped in their march. And where ever there was an over-narrow and &s;treight pa&s;&s;e, the armed &s;ouldiers received the &s;ame baggage within them, and went on either &s;ide therof. Al&s;o if there chaunced to be any let by the way, impeaching the pa&s;&s;age, certaine &s;ouldiers were appointed be&s;ide, to goe thither and remedie all. But for the mo&s;t part in this march, they kept
<PB N="144" REF="83">this order that every companie had their owne carriage with them. For, com|maundement was given unto all the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Porters.</NOTE> carriers, that every one &s;hould goe clo&s;e unto his owne companie, unle&s;&s;e &s;ome important accident fell out to the con|trary. Moreover every carrier went afore, having the watchword of his owne Centinier, &s;uch as to all the &s;ouldiers of that companie was well knowne. And therefore they kept their way clo&s;e and round togither, whiles every one did his be&s;t that none of their owne fellowes &s;hould be left behind. And &s;o doing, they needed not to &s;eeke one another, and therewith were all things hard at hand in more &s;afety, whiles the &s;ouldiers throughout the ho&s;t, had every thing &s;ooner and readier. Now, the Avantcurriers and Spies that were gone before, &s;uppo|&s;ing they &s;aw men in the plaines getting forage and wood: perceiving al&s;o draught-bea&s;ts to draw other things, and feeding the whiles: and by di&s;covering the coa&s;ts more remote, when they &s;pied as they thought any &s;moake ri&s;ing or du&s;t rai&s;ed on high: by all the&s;e &s;ignes under&s;tood that the enemies armie was &s;omewhere neere at hand: Wherefore the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Provo&s;t.</NOTE> Captaine of the&s;e Spies di&s;patch pre&s;ently one of purpo&s;e to give intelligence thereof unto <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Vpon which adverti&s;ement, he commaunded, that they &s;hould remaine &s;till in the &s;ame place of e&s;piall, for to &s;ignifie unto him from time to time what new occurrent they &s;aw. Moreover he &s;ent out a Cornet of light hor&s;emen, into tho&s;e parts before them, with commi&s;&s;ion to doe their be&s;t for to intercept &s;ome or other of them about the plaines, that he might learne the truth more certainly. Who did as they were appointed. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe be&s;towed the re&s;t of his forces in their &s;everall quarters, to provide what&s;oever he thought nece&s;&s;arie, before he appro|ched the enemies too neere. And, fir&s;t of all, he willed them to dine, then to abide in their owne &s;tations; and &s;o to have an eye unto that they were com|maunded. When they had taken their dinner, he called togither the Captaines of the hor&s;emen, footmen, and chariots, as al&s;o the Provo&s;ts over the Engins, over the carriages al&s;o with their carts and waines. Meane time whiles they came togither, tho&s;e foreriders who had skowred the plaines, brought with them certaine men, whom they had taken. And when the&s;e captives were exa|mined by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> they confe&s;&s;ed, that they belonged to the enemies campe, and were gone out, &s;ome to provide forage, others for fewell. For, by rea&s;on of the great multitude in campe, all things were very &s;carce. <HI>Cyrus</HI> hearing them &s;ay &s;o; demaunded how farre off, their armie was? who an&s;wered, 2. para&s;angs. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> enquired further and &s;aid. What! was there any talke of us among them? Yea for&s;ooth, &s;ay they, and that very much: and namely that your hoa&s;t is on foote, and approcheth neere. But, tell me further quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> were they glad when they heard &s;o? Nay verily &s;aid they, glad they were not, but exceeding &s;ad. And what are they doing now, quoth <HI>Cyrus?</HI> They are a training and &s;et|ting the &s;ouldiers in array, and even &s;o they were ye&s;terday and two dayes ago. But who is he quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> that thus embattaileth them? Even <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> him&s;elfe an&s;wered they, and with him a certaine <HI>Graecian,</HI> and another <HI>Median,</HI> one by report who is fled from you and turned to them. Mo&s;t mighty <HI>Iupiter</HI> quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &ocirc; that I might catch him, as I de&s;ire.

Howbeit, pur&s;ue them not in any wi&s;e &s;o farre as into covert and unknowne places; but &s;o &s;oone as you have taken order that your &s;pies may &s;afely re|maine and keepe the ground, retire you and depart away. Now, if there be any of them &s;hall ride towards you, holding up their hands in token of peace, re|ceive the men courteou&s;ly. So <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> went from him with this charge and armed him&s;elfe: the other hor&s;emen al&s;o his followers, rode away forthwith as he had commanded. And who &s;hould meet them in the way, on this &s;ide the &s;aid Barbican, but <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> with his men? him (I meane) who being the keeper of that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Panthea.</NOTE> Su&s;ian Lady had beene &s;ent long before as an e&s;pie? <HI>Cyrus</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw the man, but he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Leapt.</NOTE> &s;prung out of his chaire, went toward him, and lovingly tooke him by the hand. The re&s;t, who knew nothing of the matter, wondered hereat, as good cau&s;e they had, and were much amazed, untill &s;uch time as <HI>Cyrus</HI> thus &s;aid. Here is, my loving friends, a right worthy Gentleman returned unto us: For now, meet it is that all the world &s;hould know, what good &s;ervice he hath done. This per&s;on here in place, departed from us not at|taint of any lewd act, neither for feare of me: but by me was he &s;ent away of purpo&s;e, to learne out the &s;ecret de&s;ignes of our enemies, and to exhibit there|of a true report unto us. Therefore my tru&s;ty <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> looke what promi&s;e I made unto thee, I well remember,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> and with all this here performe the &s;ame I will.

With that, they all embraced <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> and tooke him by the hand. Then &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Enough of this. And now, <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> quoth hee, relate unto us what the pre&s;ent time and occa&s;ion requireth wee &s;hould know, and &s;ay not le&s;&s;e than truth one whit as touching our enemies pui&s;&s;ance. For, better it were, that wee ima|gining it to bee more, &s;hould afterwards &s;ee it le&s;&s;e, than hearing it le&s;&s;e now, &s;inde it afterwards much more. Certes, quoth <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> I have done my

Why! then quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you know not onely their number, but their order al&s;o. Yes verily, &s;aith <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> yea and in what manner they intend to embattaile and fight. Yet &s;hew us fir&s;t, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and that &s;ummarily their number. Their battalions all, quoth <HI>A|ra&s;pas,</HI> as well footmen as hor&s;emen be ordered &s;o, as that they beare in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">From the front or in fyle.</NOTE> depth thirty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or be&s;ide.</NOTE> except the Aegyptians. And, the&s;e are about<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Five miles &s;tadia.</NOTE> 40 furlongs off. For, very carefull I was to know how much ground they tooke up. But as touching the&s;e Aegyptians, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> tell me how they be embattailed, becau&s;e you &s;aid, [be|&s;ide the Aegyptians] Surely, quoth <HI>Ara&s;pas,</HI> their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mytiarchs.</NOTE> Colonels [over ten thou|&s;and] ordered them &s;o, as that every Regiment of ten thou&s;and, bare every way a hundred &s;quare. For, this manner of embattailing, was by their &s;aying after their country fa&s;hion. And <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you was very loth to graunt them thus to be arraunged. For, he de&s;ired all that he could, to hemme in your armie on every &s;ide with his battalions. And to what end, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> de&s;ired he that? Even becau&s;e he might, quoth he, environ you with his exceeding number: But fir&s;t, Let them &s;ee to it, &s;aid <HI>Cyrus,</HI> lea&s;t whiles they goe about to encompa&s;&s;e others, they be not enclo&s;ed them&s;elves. Well, we have heard of you that which the time required. Now therefore let us proceed thus accor|dingly. After yee are departed hence, looke well to the armour both of your hor&s;es and al&s;o of your &s;elves. For oftentimes, if there be wanting but a &s;mall matter, man, hor&s;e, and chariot &s;erve all to no purpo&s;e.

Then, lead you <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> the right wing according to the charge which now you have. The other Colonels like|wi&s;e, having the conduct of ten thou&s;and keepe your places &s;till.

<P>THEN <HI>Abradatas</HI> the Su&s;ian King replyed. For my part, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> willing I am of mine owne accord, to take my place even in the very face of the enemies battaile: unle&s;&s;e it &s;eeme unto you otherwi&s;e expedient. Whereat <HI>Cyrus</HI> admiring the man and taking him by the right hand, demaunded of the Per&s;ians which were in the other Chariots in this wi&s;e. Will yee al&s;o, quoth he, admit all this? But when they an&s;wered, that it could not &s;tand with their reputation to give way thereto: he did put it to the ca&s;ting of lots: and the lot fell upon <HI>Abradatas,</HI> even as him&s;elfe had undertaken: and placed he was afront the Aegyptians. Thus verily for that time they de|parted, and having provided all things, as I before &s;hewed, went to &s;upper, and after the watch &s;et betooke them&s;elves to their nights re&s;t.</P>
<P>The next day early in the morning, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;acrificed: the re&s;t al&s;o of the ar|mie, after they had<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Broke their fa&s;ts.</NOTE> dined and performed their &s;acred libations: clad them|&s;elves with many gay and goodly coats of armes, with many bre&s;t-plates be|&s;ides and helmets as faire. They harne&s;&s;ed al&s;o their hor&s;es with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Shaffions and crements.</NOTE> frontlets and poictrels. The &s;ingle hor&s;es likewi&s;e and cour&s;ers they armed with greves for their legs, as al&s;o the Steeds that drew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or in teeme.</NOTE> in their geeres with harnois for their &s;ides: in &s;o much as the whole armie &s;how againe with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Copper.</NOTE> brazen armour, and glittered throughout with red and purple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tabards.</NOTE> liveries. The foure poled cha|riot likewi&s;e of <HI>Abradatas</HI> drawne with eight Steeds, was very bravely and gallantly &s;et out. But as he was putting on a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or linnen armour, or Lacket.</NOTE> tabard of linnen after his coun|try fa&s;hion, <HI>Panthea</HI> his wife, brought unto him an helmet of gold: with vam|braces likewi&s;e and broad bracelets to weare about the wre&s;ts of his hands. Al&s;o a &s;ide purple ca&s;&s;ocke downe to his foot, with the skirts falling in plaits beneath: togither with a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or plume, as &s;aith <HI>Bingham.</HI></NOTE> cre&s;t upon his armet, of an Hyacinth or Azure dye. All the&s;e ornaments had &s;hee wrought for her husband unwitting to him, as ha|ving privily gotten the ju&s;t mea&s;ure of his armour. Which when he beheld, he wondered thereat, and &s;aid unto <HI>Panthea,</HI> How now my wife, ha&s;t thou cut and mangled thine owne Iewels and ornaments for to make mee this faire ar|mour? No verily, quoth <HI>Panthea,</HI> I have not yet defaced the mo&s;t precious and riche&s;t jewell of all. For, if you Sir, appeare unto others, as you &s;eeme un|to me, your &s;elfe &s;hall be my greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;overaine jewell. And as &s;hee thus &s;aid, &s;hee fell to enarme him, and how ever &s;he did what &s;hee could, not to be &s;eene for to weepe, yet for all that, the teares trickled downe her cheeks. And <HI>Abradatas,</HI> albeit hee was before a goodly man to &s;ee to, yet now after he was thus dight and harne&s;&s;ed with this armour, he &s;eemed right beautifull, and of a mo&s;t liberall pre&s;ence, as being by nature al&s;o corre&s;pondent thereto. Then, having taken of his charriottier the reines into his owne hand, hee addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elfe pre&s;ently to mount up into his chariot. But then, <HI>Panthea</HI> commanding all tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent to void, &s;aid thus unto him, My <HI>Abradate,</HI> If ever there were any woman that e&s;teemed her husband more than her owne life, I &s;uppo&s;e you acknowledge mee al&s;o to be one of them. And therefore what
<PB N="149" REF="85">need I to particularize in every point? For, I am per&s;waded that the deeds which I have done already, are of more credit with you, than the words which I now &s;peake. Howbeit although I bee thus affected, as you know well e|nough: yet doe I &s;olemnely profe&s;&s;e, my love to you-ward and yours al&s;o to mee: and that I had rather togither with you having borne your &s;elfe as a vali|ant Knight be enterred, than live with you di&s;graced, and taking di&s;grace my &s;elfe. So farre forth e&s;teeme I both you and my &s;elfe worthy of the be&s;t re&s;pect. Moreover, in my conceit, we are much beholden unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> in this behalfe, for that he daigned to enterteine mee a captive woman and &s;elected for him&s;elfe, not u&s;ing me as a &s;lave with villany, nor as a free woman with di&s;paragement of mine honour: but when he had received me, kept me for you, as if I had beene his owne brothers wife. Againe, when <HI>Ara&s;pas</HI> my Guardian revolted from him, I a&s;&s;ured him, if he would give me leave to &s;end unto you, that you &s;hould come unto him a more faithfull friend and a better, and every way by farre than <HI>Ara&s;pas.</HI> Thus &s;pake &s;he, and <HI>Abradatas</HI> much delighted with her &s;peech, &s;oftly touching her head and therewith looking up toward heaven made this prayer. O mo&s;t mightie Iupiter, graunt that I may bee thought an husband meet for <HI>Panthea,</HI> and a friend worthy of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who hath &s;o honourably dealt with us. With the&s;e words, he mounted the Chariot at the entry and doore of the &s;eat thereof. When he was thus gotten up, and that the Vnder-Chariotier had made fa&s;t and &s;hut the &s;eat clo&s;e after him: <HI>Panthea</HI> having no other meanes otherwi&s;e to embrace him, ki&s;&s;ed yet the very &s;ear. And &s;o the Chariot went forward: But &s;he clo&s;ely followed after her husband un&s;eene of him, untill &s;uch time as he turning him&s;elfe and e&s;pying her, &s;aid, Be of good cheere my <HI>Panthea,</HI> Fare|well, and now depart. Then, her Eunuches and waiting women tooke and con|veied her into her Caroch, and when they had laid her downe, they covered her within the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Cabin.</NOTE> clo&s;et thereof. But the folke there in place albeit both <HI>Abra|datas</HI> and his Chariot al&s;o made a goodly &s;how, yet could they not behold him untill <HI>Panthea</HI> was quire gone.</P>
<P>Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;acrificed with the favourable approbation of the Gods, and the armie was &s;et in aray as he commaunded; and had appointed A|vant Curriers one before another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e a&s;&s;embled his Captaines togither, and made a &s;peech unto them in this wi&s;e. Deare friends and Confederates. The Gods &s;hew unto us &s;uch &s;ignes in our &s;acrifices, as they did &s;ometime when they gave unto us our fir&s;t victory. I will recall therefore into your minds, tho&s;e points which if ye remember, ye &s;hall in mine opinion advance more couragiou&s;ly to battaile. For, in martiall prowe&s;&s;e, exerci&s;ed ye are much more than your ene|mies. In the &s;ame yee have beene brought up and trained farre longer than they, and joyntly one with another, have atchieved victory. Whereas, many of your enemies with their A&s;&s;ociates have beene foyled and vanqui&s;hed. And of both &s;ides, as many as have not yet fought: tho&s;e of the enemies part, know well enough that they have for A&s;&s;i&s;tants, &s;uch as will betray them: but yee that &s;ide with us are &s;ure, that yee &s;hall hazzard the fortune of battaile with them that are de&s;irous to helpe their Allies. And it &s;tandeth to good rea&s;on, that they who repo&s;e mutuall tru&s;t one in another, will joyntly &s;ticke to it, and fight with one accord: but they that di&s;tru&s;t, mu&s;t needs devi&s;e how every one may &s;oone&s;t get away and e&s;cape. Advance wee therefore my friends, again&s;t our enemies, with &s;trong armed Chariots, again&s;t tho&s;e that are not armed:
<PB N="150" REF="86">with hor&s;emen likewi&s;e in compleat armour and hor&s;es bard, again&s;t tho&s;e that be naked; ready to cope with them hand to hand. As for you that are foot|men, yee &s;hall deale with no other than yee have heretofore. The Aegyptians be harnoi&s;ed after the &s;ame &s;ort, and in like maner &s;et in aray. For greater<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Targuets.</NOTE> &s;hields they have, than that they can either doe or &s;ee ought, and being raunged by hundreds no doubt they will hinder one another in the medley, except &s;ome very few: Now if they tru&s;t by prea&s;&s;ing hard upon us, to make us give backe and lo&s;e ground: Fir&s;t, they mu&s;t beare-off the brunt of the hor&s;es them|&s;elves, then, of the yron harnois wherewith the hor&s;es are &s;trengthened. And &s;ay that any of them &s;hall hold out and abide by it, how can they po&s;&s;ibly at once mainteine fight again&s;t the hor&s;emen, and the maine battalion [of foot|men] and the turrets be&s;ide? For, from tho&s;e turrets, our men will be al|waies ready to &s;uccour us, and annoy the enemies &s;o, as being by us &s;laine, they will rather de&s;paire than fight it out. Now, if ye thinke that yee want ought, let me know: for with the leave of God yee &s;hall lacke nothing. Againe, if any man be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay ought, let him &s;peake his minde. If not, draw neere to the &s;acrifices, and when yee have prayed unto tho&s;e Gods, to whom we have &s;acrificed, repaire unto your companies: See al&s;o that every one of you put them in minde who are under your charge, concerning tho&s;e points that I have admoni&s;hed you of. And let each one &s;hew him&s;elfe unto tho&s;e that are in his conduct, &s;o undaunted and fearele&s;&s;e, in ge&s;ture, countenance and &s;peech, as he may &s;eeme worthy of commaund and government.</P>

Now were they all that attended upon <HI>Cyrus,</HI> armed as he was, to wit, in purple ta|bards, cor&s;lets and head-pieces of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or copper.</NOTE> bra&s;&s;e, with white cre&s;ts and with &s;words: every man al&s;o with a javelin of corneil wood. Their hor&s;es were bard, with frontlets, poictrels and &s;ide peeces of bra&s;&s;e. Of the &s;ame matter likewi&s;e were the greives that every man wore. This onely was the difference of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his armour from the re&s;t: that whereas their harneis was verni&s;hed over and laid with a golden colour, his glittered like a Cry&s;tall mirour. When he was once mounted, and &s;at &s;till a while, looking to his way that he was to goe, it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> thun|dered on his right hand [in token of good] whereupon he &s;aid, Thee will we follow mo&s;t mighty <HI>Iupiter.</HI> And &s;o he did &s;et forward: having on his right &s;ide <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> Generall of the hor&s;e with his men of armes, and <HI>Ara&s;ambas</HI> Co|lonell of the footmen on his left. Hee gave commaundement al&s;o, that they &s;hould ca&s;t an eye to the maine Standard, to keepe even pace and to follow in order. Now, this En&s;igne Royall that he had, was a golden Spred-Eagle di&s;|plaied upon a long &s;peare. And at this very day the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> retaineth the
<PB N="152" REF="87">&s;ame &s;tandard. But before they came within &s;ight of the enemies, he cau&s;ed the Armie by re&s;ting thrice, to refre&s;h them&s;elves. And by that time that they had marched out-right twenty &s;tadia, they began to de&s;crie their ene|mies power to approach and come forward again&s;t them. Now when they were all evidently &s;eene one of another, and the enemies determined on both &s;ides to environ the battalion [of footmen] afront them, they &s;tood &s;till with their owne maine battalion: (For, otherwi&s;e there can be no encompa&s;&s;ing round) and then wheeled about therwith for to enclo&s;e the enemies in the mids: to the end, that when they had embattailed them&s;elves on both &s;ides after the forme of the Greek letter * Gamma,<NOTE PLACE="marg">r</NOTE> they might every way fight all at once. Which albeit <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aw well enough, yet &s;taied he never the more for it, but led &s;till as before, and perceiving how far off the enemies &s;tretched out on both &s;ides the wings and points of their battaile: Marke you not <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> quoth he, where the enemies begin to fetch a winding compa&s;&s;e? Yes, very well, &s;aith <HI>Chry&s;an|tas,</HI> and I mervaile much thereat: For, me thinks they di&s;tract the points very farre from their owne maine battaile: yea and from ours too, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you. And why &s;o? &s;aid <HI>Chry&s;antas:</HI> becau&s;e quoth he, le&s;t if their wings were neere unto us, and their owne maine battaile farre remooved, wee might charge upon them. But how can they then afterwards helpe one another, &s;aid <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> when they be &s;o farre a&s;under? It is evident quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that their purpo&s;e is, when their wings have proceeded &s;o farre as to flanke us and to &s;tand again&s;t the &s;ides of our ho&s;t: then to turne &s;hort againe as it were into &s;qua|drons, and &s;o at once on every &s;ide to &s;et upon us. But what thinke you, &s;aith <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> is this their policy good or no? Good, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> in regard of that which they &s;ee: but in re&s;pect of that which they &s;ee not, they hurt them|&s;elves more, then if they &s;hould a&s;&s;aile us afront, point to point.

Oh how it doth me good my &s;ouldiours to &s;ee your faces. Another while, to others, Goe to Sirs, Thinke that this pre&s;ent fight, is not onely for this dayes victorie, but in re|gard of that al&s;o, which heretofore yee have atchieved; yea and for all felicity what&s;oever. As he came to &s;ome, he would u&s;e the&s;e words. From this time forward we &s;hall never have cau&s;e to blame the Gods, for they have put into our hands, the meanes to attaine to many and tho&s;e goodly chievances. But yet
<PB N="153" REF="87">wee mu&s;t my good &s;ouldiours play the parts of valiant men. To others againe, &s;uch a &s;peech as this he would u&s;e. What more gawdy fea&s;t could we po&s;&s;ibly bid one another unto, than to this? For, now the opportunity we have, bearing our &s;elves manfully, to &s;tead and benefit pa&s;&s;ing well one another many wayes. To another Company thus would he &s;peake: Yee know I &s;uppo&s;e my &s;ouldi|ers, that the&s;e rewards are now propo&s;ed: to wit, unto winners. To chace, to wound, to kill, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of goods, to gaine renowne and fame, to enjoy freedome, to commaund and to rule. But unto Cowards, what el&s;e but the contrary? Who&s;oever therefore loveth him&s;elfe, let him enter battaile and fight as I doe. For, with my good will no example &s;hall I give of cowardi&s;e, nor ad|mit of any lewd and di&s;honorable act. Moreover, as he came to &s;ome of tho&s;e who had &s;erved with him in the former battaile, he &s;aid: As for you my douty &s;ouldiours what need I to &s;peake unto you? For, yee wote well enough what a faire day valiant men have, and how badly cowards &s;peed. Then as hee went from them and came to <HI>Abradatas,</HI> he &s;tayed. And <HI>Abradatas,</HI> having given the reines unto the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Manhood.</NOTE> under chariotier, di&s;mounted, and made towards him: others al&s;o came running unto him who&s;e places were neere at hand, as well footmen as tho&s;e who had the conduct of chariots. And when they were come, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;pake in this wi&s;e. God hath according to your reque&s;t, &ocirc; <HI>Abradatas,</HI> judged both you and yours, worthy to lead in the vaward before our A&s;&s;ociats. Re|member therefore, that when you are to fight, they be the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who &s;hall both behold and al&s;o &s;econd you, neither will they &s;uffer you to be forlorne and &s;uccourle&s;&s;e. Then <HI>Abradatas,</HI> For mine owne &s;elfe, <HI>Cyrus.</HI> I thinke all well enough with us. But for the &s;ides of the battaile, I am perplexed and troubled. For, I &s;ee that the enemies points be &s;tretched out in length and tho&s;e very firme, by rea&s;on, as well of their chariots as all other forces: Whereas we have oppo|&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e nothing but chatiots. And therefore, but that the charge of this place, is by lot fallen unto me, I would have beene aba&s;hed to be here: in &s;uch &s;afety, me thinks I am. Goe to quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> If you be well for your owne part, take you no thought for them. For I tru&s;t, with the helpe of God to order the matter &s;o, that I &s;hall &s;hew unto you the&s;e &s;ides of the enemies naked. And here I be&s;eech you not to give the on&s;et upon the enemies, before you &s;ee even tho&s;e, whom you feare now &s;o much, put to flight. (The&s;e brave words verily gave <HI>Cyrus</HI> forth at the point of battaile, being otherwi&s;e none of the&s;e great and vanting boa&s;ters.) But when you &s;ee the&s;e quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> once to flie, then thinke me to be hard at hand, and then, lu&s;tily charge you. For then &s;hall you find the enemies to be &s;tarke cowards, and your friends right hardie &s;ouldiers. And verily, whiles you have lei&s;ure, &ocirc; <HI>Abradatas,</HI> ride every way all about your chariots, encourage and exhort your men to give the on&s;et: partly by your light&s;ome countenance embolden them, and partly by hopes relieve them. And that yee may &s;eeme the be&s;t and mo&s;t valorous of all tho&s;e that be mounted in Chariots, kindle &s;ome emulation among them.

You &s;ee now <HI>Hysta&s;pas,</HI> a piece of &s;ervice, wherein there is need of your celerity and expedition: For, if now we can get the &s;tart of our enemies, and fall fir&s;t to the killing of them,

Having thus &s;aid hee went forward, and being come as farre as to the &s;ide and to the Captaine of the chariots which were there, he &s;aid unto him: Come I am to &s;uc|cour you: But when you perceive once that we charge the enemies at the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Points.</NOTE> ends, then doe yee al&s;o your devoir to breake thorow the mids of them.

<P>CRoe&s;us &s;uppo&s;ing that the Regiment under his conduct drew very neere already unto the enemies, *** and that the wings were &s;tretched out a|long, did &s;et up a &s;ignall unto the &s;aid wings, to proceed no higher, but in that very place to turne &s;hort. Now when they all made a &s;tand, &amp; beheld the ho&s;t of <HI>Cyrus</HI> embattailed, he gave the Signe unto them for to advance again&s;t the enemies. By this meanes three &s;quadrons charged upon <HI>Cyrus</HI> his armie: one full afront: and of the other tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">e, one on the right hand, the other on the left. In &s;o much as great feare &s;eized upon the armie of <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For like un|to a little bricke couched within a greater, the battalion of <HI>Cyrus</HI> was environed on every &s;ide with the enemies: what with hor&s;emen, armed footmen, light targuatiers: and what with chariots, all but behind. Howbeit after that <HI>Cy|rus</HI> had given direction, they all turned a-bre&s;t upon the enemie. And verily, there was on all parts a deepe &s;ilence, for feare of the future event. But when <HI>Cyrus</HI> now &s;aw his time, hee began to &s;ing the Paean, and the whole Armie chaunted and an&s;wered him. Then with a loud and cheerefull note they &s;oun|ded <HI>Alala,</HI> to <HI>Mars;</HI> and with that, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;hewed him&s;elfe, and pre&s;ently with his men of armes flanking the enemies, with all &s;peed joyned battaile. The footmen al&s;o in good array, &s;oone followed after, and charged them on every &s;ide, &s;o, as that they had the greater vantage of them by farre. For, with their maine battalion, they gave a charge upon the wing, whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="88">that the enemies were mightily di&s;comfited and quickly put to flight. When <HI>Artager&s;es</HI> perceived that <HI>Cyrus</HI> was in Action and entred into the medley, him|&s;elfe al&s;o came in fiercely with his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Drome|daries.</NOTE> Camels on the left &s;ide, according as <HI>Cyrus</HI> had commaunded. Their Hor&s;es could not abide the&s;e Camels a great way off, but as their nature is, being madded, &s;ome runne away, others flung out of their ranks, and &s;ome againe ru&s;hed one upon another. For, thus fare hor&s;es, when once they e&s;pie Camels. And <HI>Artager&s;es</HI> with his owne men in good ar|ray and him&s;elfe well appointed prea&s;&s;ed hard upon them thus di&s;ranked: and withall put forth his Chariots at once both on the right &s;ide and al&s;o on the left. Whereupon many of them, to avoid the Chariots were killed by tho&s;e who followed at the wing: and as many there were, who flying from them, were intercepted and caught up by the Chariots. <HI>Abradatas</HI> al&s;o, for his part &s;lacked no time, but crying alowd, Follow me friends, follow mee, &s;pared no hor&s;e-fle&s;h, but by pricking his Steeds drew blood of them good &s;tore. And with him the re&s;t of the Chariotiers made a violent impre&s;&s;ion upon them. Then immediatly the enemies Chariots fled from them, &s;ome taking their ri|ders with them, others leaving them behind. But <HI>Abradatas</HI> pa&s;&s;ed directly through them, and violently a&s;&s;ayled the Phalang of the Aegyptians: and togi|ther with him, they al&s;o who &s;tood embatteled next, did &s;et upon them. And, as many waies el&s;e it is cleere, that there is no battaile more &s;trongly arraunged, than that which con&s;i&s;teth of friends a&s;&s;embled to fight togither: &s;o, at this time, that companie of his about him, &s;hewed no le&s;&s;e. For, they were his fami|liar friends and companions at his table that &s;tucke clo&s;e to him and joyntly charged the enemie. The re&s;t of the Chariotiers, when they &s;aw how the Ae|gyptians with a &s;trong troupe &s;tiffely abid the &s;hocke, withdrew them&s;elves toward the Chariots as they fled, and followed after them. But <HI>Abradatas</HI> his companie, where they had once broken in, becau&s;e the Aegyptians could not give backe, by rea&s;on of tho&s;e their fellowes who &s;tood thicke about them on every &s;ide, look how many they encountred directly in their way, with violence of hor&s;es they &s;lew and overthrew, and as they fell, trampled and cru&s;hed in pieces them&s;elves, their armour, their hor&s;es and wheeles: what&s;oever the yron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, hookes.</NOTE> &s;ythes of the chariots tooke hold of, they violently cut in twaine, as well har|nois and weapons as men. In this tumultuous medley that cannot be expre&s;|&s;ed in word, it fortuned that <HI>Abradatas,</HI> for that his chariot wheeles were flowne off, by rea&s;on of &s;o many confu&s;ed heaps of all &s;orts, fell out of it with others be&s;ides that accompanied him in this exploit, who having borne them|&s;elves with him in fight right manfully, were there &s;laine and left dead in the place. The Per&s;ians following hard after, ru&s;hing thither where <HI>Abradatas</HI> &amp; his companie had made the overture, di&s;ranked the enemies and killed them out|right. But the Aegyptians where they &s;tood &s;till, in good order, not di&s;arrayed (and the&s;e were many in number) advanced directly forward all a-bre&s;t again&s;t the Per&s;ians, where there was a hote and fierce conflict pell-mell, with launces, cha&s;ing &s;taves and &s;words. And, to &s;ay a truth, the Aegyptians had the ods as well in number as in weapon. For, they bare &s;tiffe and long Launces (which even at this day they u&s;e) &s;hields al&s;o which convered their bodies much more than the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Curaces.</NOTE> bre&s;t plates and bucklers of the Per&s;ians, and helped them &s;omewhat el&s;e to punch and &s;hoove from them, fitted as they were to their &s;houlders. And therefore locking their targuets togither, they went on and thru&s;t from
<PB N="156" REF="89">them. But the Per&s;ians were not able to &s;u&s;taine their force, con&s;idering they carried their light bucklers of wicker at armes end: but &s;oftly retired<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> foot by foot, giving and taking blowes, untill &s;uch time as they gate clo&s;e under their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or engins.</NOTE> fabricks afore&s;aid. When they were thither come, the Aegyptians began to have the wor&s;e, and to be wounded afre&s;h from the Turrets. They then who &s;tood behind in the rere, would &s;uffer neither Archers nor Darters to flye, but lifting up and bending their &s;words at them, forced them both to &s;hoot arrowes and al&s;o to fling darts. Hereupon grew a great carnage of men, and a mightie noi&s;e and clattering, as well of armours as of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, mi&s;&s;ive.</NOTE> ca&s;ting weapons of all &s;orts, to|gither with a wonderfull cry: whiles &s;ome called to their fellowes, others en|couraged them to fight, and a third &s;ort cryed unto the Gods for their helpe. Meane-while, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who had pur&s;ued in chace tho&s;e that &s;tood again&s;t him, came: and &s;eeing the Per&s;ians put backe and lo&s;e ground, he grieved at it: perceiving al&s;o that by no other meanes he could &s;ooner &s;tay the enemies from prea&s;&s;ing &s;till forward, than by wheeling about and riding at their very taile, he commaunded his men to follow him, and &s;o rode hard upon their rereward. Thus they a&s;&s;aile and wound them behind, yea and kill many of them looking another way. Which when the Aegyptians perceived, they cryed, That the enemies were hard at their backs, and withall, amid their wounds, were faine to turne head upon them and make re&s;i&s;tance. Then fought hor&s;emen and foot|men one with another. And there it fortuned, that one being falne under <HI>Cyrus</HI> his hor&s;e, as he lay trampled under foot, with his &s;word &s;tabbed the hor&s;e in the bellie: wherupon the bea&s;t, win&s;ing and flinging out with his heeles for paine of the wound, never re&s;ted untill he had ca&s;t and overthrowne <HI>Cyrus.</HI> But here a man might have &s;eene, what a worthy matter it is for a Prince to be loved of his &s;ubjects. For, pre&s;ently they all did &s;et up an outcry, and with exceeding violence, fought togither right manfully. Here was thru&s;ting to and fro: here were blowes given and taken reciprocally. But one at length of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his guard, alighting from his owne hor&s;e, mounted him thereupon. Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was gotten up, he might by that time &s;ee the Aegyptians beaten downe on every &s;ide. For, both <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> was come already with the Per&s;ian Ca|vallery, and <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> al&s;o. Howbeit he would not &s;uffer them any longer to run upon the Aegyptians battalion: but commaunded, from without, to di&s;|charge arrowes and darts at them. Now, after he had ridden all about, untill he was come unto the fabricks, he thought good to get up into one of the tur|rets, to e&s;py whether any other companie of the enemies &s;tood to it and fought in any place. When he was once aloft, he &s;aw the whole field and plaine before him full of hor&s;es, men and chariots: &s;ome flying, others chacing: &s;ome win|ners, others lo&s;ers: to wit, the enemies running away, and his owne men ha|ving the upper hand. And verily, of tho&s;e that were di&s;comfited, he could &s;ee none any more but onely the Aegyptians. Who being driven to a &s;treight, ca&s;t them&s;elves round into a ring, &s;o as their armour was onely &s;eene, and they &s;et clo&s;e covered under their &s;hields. And now verily, nought did they el&s;e, but abide many and grievous extremities. <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, wondring at them and pity|ing their di&s;tre&s;&s;e, to &s;ee &s;o hardy and valiant men to die, cau&s;ed all tho&s;e to re|tyre, that charged them on every &s;ide, not permitting one of them to fight any longer. He &s;ent withall an Herault at Armes unto them, demaunding whether they would all of them peri&s;h, for their &s;akes who had betrayed them, or ra|ther
<PB N="157" REF="89">&s;ave their owne lives, with the reputation of brave and valourous &s;oldiers? Vnto whom they an&s;wered, And how can we be &s;aved, and yet reputed valiant &s;ouldiers? Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aid againe: For that yee are the men alone, whom wee &s;ee to abide by it and willing to fight it out. But, from henceforth, replyed the Aegyptians: By what good and notable Action of ours may wee po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved? In ca&s;e, quoth he, yee deliver up your armes into our hands, and joyne with them in amitie, who when it lies in their power to de&s;troy you, choo&s;e rather to &s;ave your lives. Which when the Aegyptians heard, they as|ked this que&s;tion: Say, we enter into league and friend&s;hip with you, In what manner would you carry your &s;elfe to usward? Then, an&s;wered <HI>Cyrus:</HI> I will doe well by you, and looke for the like at your hands, as of true liege men. And what good turne is that &s;aid they, which you will deigne us? Whereto <HI>Cyrus</HI> made this an&s;wer. I will give you better pay, during the warre, than at this time yee receive. But if there be a peace concluded; as many of you, as li&s;t to tarry with me, I will endow with lands to occupie, and Cities to inhabit. I will be&s;tow upon them wives and hou&s;hold &s;ervants. Which when the Ae|gyptians heard, they intreated him to except this onely in the Capitulation, that they might not be compelled to beare armes again&s;t <HI>Croe&s;us.</HI> For, him a|lone &s;aid they, we acquit of all fault. As for all other Articles they agreed un|to: and therewith plighted their faith and troth interchangeably.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> following the traine of his victorie forced the Citie Sardes, and tooke King <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> pri&s;oner. The di&s;cour&s;e that he held with him as touching the Oracle of <HI>Apollo.</HI> And how hee did &s;et him at libertie, and &s;aved the &s;aid Citie from &s;accage.</HEAD>
<P>IN this battaile, the Aegyptians alone of all the enemies bare them&s;elves courageou&s;ly and wonne renowne: and of tho&s;e on <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ide the Per&s;ian hor&s;emen &s;eemed to performe the brave&s;t &s;ervice. In &s;o much, as that man|ner of armour, which <HI>Cyrus</HI> cau&s;ed them to be made for the men of Armes, continueth &s;till in credit and price to this very day: Al&s;o tho&s;e fythed Chariots were in high e&s;teeme: &s;o that even in this age, the King who reigneth in tho&s;e parts, reteines the u&s;e alwaies of that warlike kinde of Chariots. The Camels onely affrighted the hor&s;es and did no other hurt. For, as they that rode upon them, &s;lew none of the hor&s;emen, &s;o were not they killed by the hor&s;emen: becau&s;e there was not an hor&s;e that came neere unto them. And even that, was thought then to doe good. Howbeit, there is no valiant man of any worth and qualitie, willing either to keepe a Camel for his &s;addle, or to practi&s;e fight and &s;ervice from their backs. Thus therefore being come againe to their wonted
<PB N="158" REF="90">manner and fa&s;hion, they are employed onely as bea&s;ts for carriage. As for <HI>Cy|rus</HI> his &s;ouldiers, after they had &s;upped and appointed their Sentinels, betooke them&s;elves, as meet it was, to their nights re&s;t.</P>
<P>But <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> upon this overthrow immediatly fled with his armie to Sardes: the other nations departed and tooke the way homeward, every man reaching &s;o farre as po&s;&s;ibly he could by night. The morrow morning when day appea|red, <HI>Cyrus</HI> led his power forthwith directly to Sardes: And no &s;ooner was he come to the walles of the Citie, but he planted his Ordnance, and bent his En|gins of Artillery, intending to give an A&s;&s;ault thereto, and prepared ladders to skale. Whiles he was bu&s;ied hereabout, he cau&s;ed the <HI>Chaldaees</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> the night following to get up unto tho&s;e munitions and bulwarks of the <HI>Sardi|ans</HI> which &s;eemed mo&s;t &s;teepe. Now, he that guided them was a <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> one who had beene a &s;ervant to a garri&s;on &s;ouldier within the Ca&s;tle of the City: A man, that had learned both the de&s;cent downe to the river, and the a&s;cent al&s;o into the Ca&s;tle. But when it was once knowne that the &s;aid high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or Ca&s;tle.</NOTE> fortre&s;&s;e was &s;urprized, the <HI>Lydians</HI> all abandoned the wals, and fled every man whither he could. <HI>Cyrus</HI> by the breake of day entred the City, and gave commaunde|ment that no man &s;hould breake his ray or quit his place. But <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> being &s;hut clo&s;e within his royall Palace, cryed out unto <HI>Cyrus:</HI> Howbeit <HI>Cyrus</HI> lea|ving a &s;trong guard about him, went in per&s;on to the Ca&s;tle that was newly wonne. Where, &s;eeing how the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> kept the Piece (as requi&s;ite it was) and the <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> armour no where to bee &s;eene (for, runne downe they were to rifle and ran&s;ake hou&s;es) pre&s;ently he called their Captaines togither, and com|maunded them with all &s;peed to avoid out of the Armie; For, I cannot quoth he, endure to &s;ee them that breake order and for&s;ake their ranks, to enrich them|&s;elves with pillage, above others. And know yee this a&s;&s;uredly, quoth he, that I had determined with my &s;elfe to make you that &s;erve with me, &s;uch as all the <HI>Chaldaees</HI> might report to be happie. But now, mervaile not at all, if &s;ome one &s;tronger than your &s;elves, &s;et upon you as yee depart from hence. Which the <HI>Chaldaees</HI> hearing, were &s;o &s;trucken with feare, that they be&s;ought him to lay downe his anger, &s;aying, they would re&s;tore all the money and goods which they had taken. To whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> made an&s;wer, that him&s;elfe had no need there|of. But if yee would have me &s;aith he to cea&s;e my di&s;plea&s;ure and indignati|on, Be&s;tow all that yee have gotten vpon them that kept the Ca&s;tle: For, if the re&s;t of the &s;ouldiers &s;hall perceive, that they who for&s;ake not their ranks and &s;tations, gaine greater commodities than others, all will goe well on my &s;ide. And even &s;o did the <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> as <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded. And as many as had be|haved them&s;elves obediently, received much money and goods of all kinds. Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> had pitched tents for his owne &s;ouldiers in that place of the City wherein hee thought mo&s;t commodious for them to abide in armes, hee gave commaundement, that to &s;upper they &s;hould goe. Thus having &s;et all things in order, he commaunded that <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> &s;hould be brought unto him. No &s;ooner &s;aw hee <HI>Cyrus,</HI> but he &s;aid, All haile, my Lord and Ma&s;ter. For, this is the name that Fortune hath graunted both you to u&s;e from henceforth, and me al&s;o to call you by. And you likewi&s;e quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> All haile &ocirc; <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> &s;ince we both of us are mortall men. But, would you, my <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> quoth he, giue me any Coun&s;ell? I would to God, &s;aith hee, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I could deui&s;e &s;ome good thing for you. For, I might thinke, that the &s;ame would be gainefull and com|modious
<PB N="159" REF="90">modious to my &s;elfe. Then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> li&s;ten O <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> what I &s;hall &s;ay. Whereas I &s;ee my &s;ouldiers &s;pent, by taking exceeding paines, and plunged into many daungers, thinke now that they hold in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the riche&s;t Citie in all A&s;ia next to Babylon, I judge them worthy to receive &s;ome benefit for their &s;ervice. For, this I know, that unle&s;&s;e they reape &s;ome fruit of their travailes, I &s;hall not have them long obedient unto mee. Howbeit, my meaning is not to give them the &s;poile of this Citie. For I &s;uppo&s;e, that not onely the Citie would thereby be utterly de&s;troyed, but I wote well al&s;o, that in the rifling thereof, the wor&s;t will &s;peed be&s;t. Which when <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> heard: Give me leave I pray you, quoth he, to &s;ay unto &s;ome of the Lydians, whom I will make choice of, that I have obtained at your hands thus much, That there &s;hall be no pillage at all, and that you will not &s;uffer their wives and children to be quite undone: In regard of which grace and favour, That I have promi&s;ed unto you in the name of the Lydians, that they &s;hall willingly and a&s;&s;uredly give unto you as a ran&s;ome what&s;oever is faire and of be&s;t price in all Sardes. For, if they &s;hall heare thus much, I am a&s;&s;ured they will come with what beautifull thing or precious jewell either man or woman hath here. And like|wi&s;e, by another yeere, the City will be repleni&s;hed with many goodly things for you. Whereas, if you fall to &s;acke and &s;poyle it, you &s;hall have your very arts and &s;ciences, which are the fountaines, they &s;ay, of all good things, to pe|ri&s;h utterly. Moreover, &s;eeing and knowing all this, you may come and con&s;ult further hereafter of &s;accage at your plea&s;ure. But fir&s;t of all, quoth he, &s;end you for mine owne trea&s;ure: and let your officers require the &s;ame at the hands of mine, the keepers thereof. <HI>Cyrus</HI> approoved all that <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> had &s;aid, and gave con&s;ent to doe accordingly. But tell me fir&s;t my <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> quoth he, and that to the full, what was the end of tho&s;e points which were delivered unto you from the Delphicke Oracle? For, it is reported, that you have highly honoured <HI>A|pollo,</HI> and done all in obedience to him. Helas, I would it had prooved &s;o, quoth <HI>Croe&s;us.</HI> But the truth is, My deportment to <HI>Apollo</HI> hath beene &s;uch, as to doe all from the very fir&s;t cleane contrary unto him. How came that about, quoth <HI>Cyrus?</HI> enforme me I pray you. For the&s;e be wonders, and paradoxes that you tell me. Fir&s;t and formo&s;t, &s;aith <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> &s;etting behind me all care, to enquire of that God, tho&s;e things that were nece&s;&s;ary for mee, I would needs make proofe, for&s;ooth, whether he could an&s;wer truth or no? And well knowne it is, &s;aith he, I will not &s;ay, that God, but even very men who are good and hone&s;t, cannot of all things abide to be di&s;credited: and if they perceive them&s;elves once that they are not beleeved, they love not tho&s;e that di&s;tru&s;t the~. But after|wards, knowing that I had committed a gro&s;&s;e ab&s;urditie, and was farre from <HI>Delphi,</HI> I &s;end unto him about children. But he, at the fir&s;t time gave mee not &s;o much as an an&s;wer. Yet afterwards, when by pre&s;enting unto him many gifts of gold and &s;ilver both, and by killing very many bea&s;ts in &s;acrifice, I had at length pacified him, as I thought; to this my demaund, how I might doe for children? hee an&s;wered me, that children I &s;hould have. And verily, a father I was of children (for in this al&s;o I a&s;&s;ure you he lied not unto me.) But when they were borne, I had no joy nor comfort of them. For, the one of them was all his life time dumbe and never &s;pake word: the other being growne to excel|lent proofe, dyed in the very flowre and be&s;t time of his age. Depre&s;&s;ed thus with the&s;e calamities as touching mine i&s;&s;ue, I &s;end eft&s;oones to know of the
<PB N="160" REF="91">God, by what meanes I might lead the re&s;t of my life in greate&s;t felicitie? and this an&s;were he returned to me.</P>

<P><HI>OR THVS, CROESE,</HI> KNOW THY SELFE, AND THOV ART HE THAT TO THY LAST SHALT HAPPY BE.</P>
<P>Vpon the hearing of this Oracle, I rejoyced: For, I thought that the God by enjoyning to me a mo&s;t ea&s;ie matter, gave me happines. For, I &s;uppo&s;ed, that as other men might partly know &s;ome, and in part not: &s;o every one knew him&s;elfe well enough. And verily all the time following, &s;o long as I lived quietly in peace, no cau&s;e had I after my &s;onne his death, to complaine of for|tune. But being once per&s;waded by the <HI>A&s;syrian</HI> King to undertake an expediti|on, and to warre again&s;t you: I entred into a world of daungers. Howbeit, e&s;|cape I did &s;afe for that time, without &s;u&s;taining any hurt. So, that herein I blame not the God. For, &s;o &s;oone as I perceived my &s;elfe unable to hold out with you in fight, by the helpe of God, both I and al&s;o my companie gat away in &s;afety. But now eft&s;oones, waxing more proud by rea&s;on both of my pre|&s;ent wealth, and their per&s;wa&s;ions al&s;o who reque&s;ted me to be their Generall: allured al&s;o by the rich gifts which they be&s;towed upon me: &s;ollicited againe by men who by way of flattery bare me in hand, that if I would take upon me this &s;overaigne government, all the world would be ruled by me: Lord I &s;hould be of all, and the greate&s;t Potentate upon earth: By the&s;e and &s;uch like words I &s;ay, being puffed up; &s;o &s;oone as all the Kings and Princes round about me had elected me for their Generall, I tooke upon me to conduct this royall Ar|mie: as if I had beene the onely man &s;ufficient for that &s;upreme greatne&s;&s;e. But in truth, herein I knew not my &s;elfe: For that I thought I was able to match you in the field: who fir&s;t de&s;cended from the Gods, and then, reckoning Kings for your progenitours, have even from your childhood practi&s;ed vertue and chivalrie. Whereas, the fir&s;t of my aunce&s;tors that ware a diademe, I heare &s;ay, became at once, a King and a Free-man. By good right therefore puni&s;hed I am for mine ignorance in that behalfe. But now at la&s;t, good <HI>Cyrus,</HI> quoth he, I know my &s;elfe: and thinke you Sir, that <HI>Apollo</HI> &s;pake true when he &s;aid, That if I knew my &s;elfe, I &s;hould be happy? For, this que&s;tion verily, I put unto you of purpo&s;e, becau&s;e you &s;eeme able to give the neere&s;t conjecture thereof by this pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;eeing in your hand it is to effect the thing. Then &s;aid <HI>Cy|rus,</HI> Impart unto mee your coun&s;ell concerning this matter. For, con&s;idering your former felicitie, I pitie your pre&s;ent condition, and here withall, I permit you to enjoy your wife whom you have, your daughters al&s;o (for, I heare &s;ay you have &s;ome) together with your friends, your &s;ervitours, and the table, &s;uch as hitherto yee have lived at. As for battailes and wars, I<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, free you from.</NOTE> di&s;able you: If it be &s;o, quoth <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> then, for the love of God, deliberate no further what an&s;were to give unto me as touching my happine&s;&s;e. For now, I prote&s;t unto you: If you doe thus as you &s;ay, it will come to pa&s;&s;e, that the &s;ame life which others have reputed mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed, and to whom my &s;elfe have accorded, I &s;hall now both have and hold. Then replyed <HI>Cyrus,</HI> And what per&s;on enjoyeth this happy life? Even mine owne wife, quoth he, O <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For, of all good things, of all delicacies and delight&s;ome plea&s;ures &s;hee hath beene partaker with mee:
<PB N="161" REF="91">but of the cares about attaining thereto, of warres al&s;o and battaile &s;hee never had part with me.

<P>THe next morrow, <HI>Cyrus</HI> having called unto him certaine of his &s;erjeants and officers about him. Tell me quoth hee, whether any of you hath &s;eene <HI>Abradatas?</HI> For I mervaile much, that I cannot have a &s;ight of him now, who heretofore was wont to frequent our pre&s;ence. Then an&s;we|red one of the &s;aid officers. My Lord, he is not living: but &s;laine he was in the field, what time as in his chariot he valiantly brake in among the Aegyptians. All the re&s;t of his companie &s;ave onely certaine of his familiar friends, avoided, (by report,) the daunger and for&s;ooke him, when they once &s;aw the &s;trong troupe of the Aegyptians. And now quoth he, the &s;peech goeth, that his wife hath taken up his dead corps, be&s;towed it in the very<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Waggon.</NOTE> Carroch wherein &s;hee was wont to ride, and brought it &s;omewhither hereabout, to the river <HI>Pacto|lus.</HI> They &s;ay al&s;o, that his Eunuches and &s;ervants are a digging for him now dead, a grave upon a certaine little hill: and the woman her &s;elfe fitteth on the ground; who having dre&s;&s;ed and adorned her husband with &s;uch things, as &s;he had, holdeth his head re&s;ting upon her knees. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard this, he &s;mote his thighs: and forthwith mounting on hor&s;ebacke, and taking with him a thou|&s;and men of armes rode to &s;ee this woefull &s;pectacle. Likewi&s;e he commaun|ded <HI>Gadatas</HI> and <HI>Gobryas,</HI> to take with them, what ornaments they could get, be|fitting &s;o friendly and valiant a man thus decea&s;ed, and to &s;eeke him out. Fur|thermore, if there were any one that had either any Heards, Kine, Oxen, or Hor&s;es in his traine, him he charged to bring them along with him: yea and many &s;heep be&s;ides, to drive to the place whereever he &s;hould heare that him|&s;elfe was: to the end that the &s;ame might be killed and &s;acrificed in the honour
<PB N="154" REF="92">of <HI>Abradatas</HI> his Funerall. Now when <HI>Cyrus</HI> was come, and &s;aw the wo|man &s;itting upon the ground, and the dead corps there lying, he wept for very ruth of this hard fortune, and &s;aid withall, O valiant and faithfull heart: Alas the while: and ha&s;t thou left us and gone thy waies? with that he tooke him by the right hand: and loe, the dead mans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, arme.</NOTE> hand followed him: For, cut off it had beene by the Aegyptians, and di&s;&s;evered from the body with an arming &s;word: which when he &s;aw, he grieved &s;o much the more. The Lady al&s;o, &s;etting up a pitious cry, and taking the hand from <HI>Cyrus</HI> ki&s;&s;ed it, and fitted it againe as well as &s;he could in the right place: &s;aying al&s;o, The re&s;t of his body, O <HI>Cyrus,</HI> is in the like ca&s;e. But, what &s;hould you &s;ee and view the &s;ame? And all this I know, quoth &s;he, hath he &s;uffred for my &s;ake e&s;pecially, and perhaps nothing le&s;&s;e for yours. For, I fooli&s;h and &s;illy woman that I was, u&s;ed many words to encou|rage him, &s;o to carry him&s;elfe as might be&s;eeme your friend and one worthy of mens commendation. And as for him, I know very well, he never con&s;ide|red what he did, but how he might by any brave exploits and worthy &s;ervice gratifie you. Therefore, he verily for his part hath had a noble and renowned death: whereas I, who exhorted him thereto, &s;it here alive. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had continued a good while &s;ilent and weeping &s;till, at length hee &s;pake and &s;aid. This Knight, Madame, hath made an excellent end. For he died with victory. But here, you &s;hall take of me the&s;e things, wherewith to adorne his body (for both <HI>Gobryas</HI> and <HI>Gadatas</HI> al&s;o were in place, and had brought with them good &s;tore of funerall ornaments) and for the time to come, know this, that of other things to doe him honour, there &s;hall be no want. Nay, there be many of us, that proportionally to our e&s;tare and degree, will in memoriall of him erect a monument: yea and in his honour, killed there &s;hall be what&s;oever is conveni|ent for &s;o noble a per&s;onage. Neither, &s;hall your &s;elfe be forlorne and for&s;aken: but in regard of your cha&s;tity and all manner of vertue be&s;ides, as I will grace you otherwi&s;e, &s;o I will commend you upon tru&s;t, to &s;ome one who &s;hall bring you whither&s;oever you would. Do but you &s;ay onely unto whom you de&s;ire to be brought. Then <HI>Panthea,</HI> &s;et your heart at re&s;t quoth &s;he &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus:</HI> For, con|ceale I will not from you, to whom I have a mind to goe. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had thus communed with her, he departed: pitying the woman, who had lo&s;t &s;uch a husband, and the man likewi&s;e who had left &s;uch a wife, and &s;hould never &s;ee her more. Then &s;he having commaunded her Eunuches to void, untill &s;uch time quoth &s;he, as I have bewailed him my fill and as I would my &s;elfe: willed her nur&s;e to abide &s;till with her: whom &s;he &s;treightly charged, that after her &s;elfe was dead, &s;he &s;hould wind both her husband and her, in one and the &s;ame &s;hrow|ding &s;heet. The nur&s;e be&s;ought her mo&s;t in&s;tantly, not to commit &s;uch a deed. Howbeit, when &s;he could not prevaile, but &s;aw her angry and much di&s;plea&s;ed with her, &s;he &s;at her downe and wept. Then <HI>Panthea,</HI> who a good while before, had prepared a cimiter for the purpo&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> killeth her &s;elfe, and repo&s;ing her head upon her husbands bre&s;t, yeelded up her vitall breath. With that, the nur&s;e skriked out aloud, and enwrapped them both according as <HI>Panthea</HI> had given her in charge. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> being adverti&s;ed what a deed the woman had done, was wonderou&s;ly affrighted, and went to &s;ee, if haply he might helpe and doe any good. At which very in&s;tant, her Eunuches who were in number three, &s;eeing what was befallen, drew forth their cimiters al&s;o, and in the very place, where &s;hee had commaunded them to &s;tand, &s;lew them&s;elves.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> by the wi&s;edome and policie of <HI>Cadu&s;ius,</HI> tooke the King of Phrygia pri&s;oner: brought under &s;ubjection in &s;mall time the Cappadocians, the Arabians and all the Nations round about. Which done, how he embattailed his forces to the num|ber of <HI>40000.</HI> men in armes, and approched Babylon.</HEAD>
<P>AFter all this, the <HI>Carians</HI> vpon &s;ome di&s;cord and variance that aro&s;e a|mong them, growing to civill warre, tho&s;e I meane, who held and in|habited the &s;trong forts of the country, came from both &s;ides to <HI>Cyrus</HI> and be&s;ought his aide. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe remaining &s;till in Sardes, cau&s;ed fa|bricks and engins, and warlike rammes to be made, to the end hee might raze their holds and ca&s;tles who would not come in and yeeld obedience unto him. But into Caria he &s;ent <HI>Cadu&s;ius</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> a man otherwi&s;e not unwitty, nor un|skilfull in military feats, and be&s;ides very gracious and of plea&s;ant behaviour, him I &s;ay, he &s;ent with the conduct of an armie: In which expedition, the <HI>Cili|cians and Cyprians</HI> right willingly joyned with him. Which was the cau&s;e that he never did &s;et any <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lord over the <HI>Cilicians</HI> and the <HI>Cyprians,</HI> but &s;tood contented with their owne native Kings. Howbeit, he impo&s;ed a tribute upon them, and enjoyned them to &s;erve in his warres, as occa&s;ion required. Now when this <HI>Cadu&s;ius,</HI> Generall of the forces above-&s;aid, was come into <HI>Caria,</HI> there pre&s;ented them&s;elues unto him certaine <HI>Carians</HI> of both factions, ready to receive him into their &s;trong forts and walled townes, for to endamage the adver&s;e &s;ide. But <HI>Cadu&s;ius</HI> did by both alike, and &s;hewed vnto them the &s;ame countenance: &s;aying unto tho&s;e with whom hee happened to parle, that they &s;pake to right good purpo&s;e, and propounded conditions &s;tanding better with rea&s;on than the other: willing them withall, to carry the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e &s;o clo&s;ely, as that their oppo&s;ites might not know they were entred into amity with him, ma|king &s;emblance as if by this meanes he meant to &s;et upon the adver&s;e &s;ide more unprovided. Moreover he required &s;ecurity on both parts: to wit, that the <HI>Ca|rians</HI> &s;hould &s;weare for to receive the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> into their walled townes without all fraud, and to the behoufe of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ians:</HI> al&s;o that him&s;elfe &s;hould take an oath, that he would enter into their forts without guile and to the good of tho&s;e that admitted him. Which when he had made &s;ure, he appointed unto them both, one and the &s;ame night, without the knowledge either of other: and in it with his Cavallery entred their Ca&s;tles, and &s;o at one time, became ma&s;ter
<PB N="164" REF="93">of both their &s;aid fortre&s;&s;es. So &s;oone as day appeared, &s;itting in the mids with his army about him, he called before him, &s;uch per&s;ons of either &s;ide, as were men of worth and action, who being in place, and looking one upon another, tooke the matter very ill: &s;uppo&s;ing they were on both &s;ides circumvented and deceived. But <HI>Cadu&s;ius</HI> made a &s;peech unto them to this effect. I &s;ware unto you, O yee <HI>Carians,</HI> that I would enter the&s;e holds and ca&s;tles without all guile, and for their benefit who received me. Therefore, If I &s;hould de&s;troy either of you, I iudge my &s;elfe to have come in, to the hurt and hinderance of the <HI>Carians:</HI> But if I make peace betweene you, and worke it &s;o, that yee may in &s;afety till your grounds, I &s;uppo&s;e then, that my comming is for your good and profit. And therefore, behoovefull it is, that from this day forward, yee commerce friendly one with another, follow your husbandry without feare, and contract mutuall marriages betweene your children reciprocally. Now if there be any of you be&s;ides the true meaning hereof, goe about to offer injurie: know they, that both <HI>Cyrus</HI> and we will be enemies unto them. From thenceforth, were the &s;aid Ca&s;tle gates &s;et open, the wayes frequented with pa&s;&s;engers re&s;orting to and fro, and the fields full of husbandmen tilling the ground. On both &s;ides they kept holidayes and made fea&s;ts; In a word, all places were with peace and joy repleni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Soone after, there arrived certaine me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Cyrus</HI> [unto <HI>Cadu&s;ius</HI>] demaunding of him, whether he &s;tood in need of any forces or munition? Vn|to whom he made an&s;wer, that he could make u&s;e, even of the armie which he had already el&s;e-where. And no &s;ooner had he uttered the&s;e words, but he led away his power, leaving behind him in the &s;aid walled townes, &s;ouldiers in garri&s;on. But the <HI>Carians</HI> earne&s;tly be&s;ought him to &s;tay, which when he refu|&s;ed to doe, they &s;ent unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> reque&s;ting him to &s;end <HI>Cadu&s;ius</HI> unto them for to be their Governour.</P>
<P>About this time, <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;ent away <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> with an armie, into that <HI>Phry|gia</HI> which boundeth upon <HI>Helle&s;pontus.</HI> Therefore, after that <HI>Cadu&s;ius</HI> was come, he commaunded him to follow with his power, that very way where <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> was gone before: to the end that the <HI>Phrygians</HI> might the rather yeeld obedi|ence unto <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> hearing once that other forces were to joyne with his: And verily tho&s;e Greeks which inhabit the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, by giving many pre&s;ents, wrought &s;o, that they were not compelled, to admit the <HI>Barbarians</HI> into their fen&s;ed townes: but onely to pay tribute, and goe to &s;erve in the warres, whither <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;hould commaund them. But the King of <HI>Phrygia</HI> prepared to &s;tand up|on his owne guard, as if he would defend his &s;trong holds and not obey: and &s;o he openly gave it out and &s;ent defiance. But when his Captaines were once re|volted from him, &s;o that he was left alone, at the la&s;t he rendred him&s;elfe into the hands of <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> for to receive his doome of <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Then <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> leaving behind him &s;trong garri&s;ons of <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;ouldiers in the fortre&s;&s;es, di&s;lodged, and led away with him over and above his owne forces, many <HI>Phrygians</HI> as well hor&s;emen as targuatiers. Now <HI>Cyrus</HI> had given authority and commi&s;&s;ion unto <HI>Cadu&s;ius,</HI> after he had ioyned with <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> to bring tho&s;e <HI>Phrygians</HI> with their armour, who made choi&s;e to &s;ide with him: but &s;uch as cho&s;e rather to fight, to unhor&s;e and di&s;arme; and commaund them all to follow with &s;lings. Thus were they at that time employed.</P>
<P>But <HI>Cyrus</HI> went forward out of <HI>Sardes</HI> [toward <HI>Babylon,</HI>] leaving there in the
<PB N="165" REF="93">City a &s;trong garri&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. of <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></NOTE> of footmen: having <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> in his company and carry|ing away with him many carts and waines loden with trea&s;ure and riches of all &s;orts. <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> al&s;o thither came, who having preci&s;ely &s;et downe in writing, all the parcels of trea&s;ure which were in every waine, gave up the &s;aid booke into <HI>Cyrus</HI> his hands: &s;aying withall unto him: If you have about you quoth he, O <HI>Cyrus,</HI> this Inventary, you &s;hall know who dealeth truly and ju&s;tly, in delivering up his charge, and who doth not. Then &s;aid <HI>Cyrus;</HI> You doe well, good <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> to provide thus for the wor&s;t. But &s;urely, they &s;hall for me, carry the goods, who are worthy, even to be owners thereof: &s;o that if they embecile or &s;teale any of it, they &s;hall but rob them&s;elves of their owne goods. Which &s;aid, hee put tho&s;e notes into the hands of his friends and Captaines, that they might take account and know, whether they that had the charge of tho&s;e things delivered them backe &s;afe and &s;ound, or no? The <HI>Lydians</HI> likewi&s;e, as many as he &s;aw to &s;hew them&s;elves gallantly in armes on hor&s;ebacke and in chariots, &s;uch al&s;o as endeavoured every way to performe that, whereby they thought to doe him plea&s;ure, he led with him in his armie. But whom he perceived to follow him unwillingly, from them he tooke their hor&s;es, and gave them to tho&s;e <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who fir&s;t had &s;erved with him in the warres. Their armour he burnt, and con|&s;trained them&s;elves to follow after with &s;lings: Yea and all tho&s;e without armes, whom he had vanqui&s;hed and &s;ubdued, he forced to exerci&s;e the &s;ling: thinking that kind of weapon and manner of &s;ervice mo&s;t ba&s;e and &s;ervile. For, how ever it falleth out, that &s;lingers otherwhiles if they be in place, with other forces &s;tand in very good &s;tead: yet by them&s;elves, put them altogither, if they encounter but a few of &s;uch as u&s;e weapons for clo&s;e fight at hand, they are not able to hold out the skirmi&s;h. Now in his journey toward <HI>Babylon,</HI> he brought under his &s;ubjection by the way, the <HI>Phrygians</HI> inhabiting that great <HI>Phrygia:</HI> the <HI>Cappadocians</HI> al&s;o and <HI>Arabians</HI> he &s;ubdued. And with the harnois and weapons of all the&s;e, hee furni&s;hed the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> hor&s;emen to the full number of 40000. Semblably many of the Captives hor&s;emen he di&s;tributed among all his A&s;&s;o|ciates throughout. So, he came before <HI>Babylon</HI> with a mighty power of hor&s;e|men, with many archers al&s;o and darters, but with &s;lingers innumerable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> laid &s;iege unto the City Babylon, and by a wonderfull &s;tratageme wonne it. How the King of A&s;&s;yria and his men, were &s;laine, the city put to the &s;acke, and the fortre&s;&s;es rendred into his hands.</HEAD>
<P>CYRVS being now &s;et before <HI>Babylon,</HI> with his whole armie, inve&s;ted the City. Then accompanied with his friends, and &s;uch of his A&s;&s;ociates as were men of Action, him&s;elfe in per&s;on made a bravado and rode about the towne. After he had well viewed the wals thereof, he intended pre&s;ently to withdraw his forces from the city. At which time a certaine fugitive from out of the towne came and gave him intelligence, that the <HI>Babylonians</HI> would &s;ally forth upon him, as hee &s;hould retire with his armie: For when from the wals they beheld this maine battaile of yours &s;aith he, it &s;eemed but weake. And no mervaile in very truth, that it &s;hould be &s;o. For, when they encircled the wals
<PB N="166" REF="94">being &s;o large in compa&s;&s;e, it could not otherwi&s;e be but the &s;aid maine battali|on mu&s;t grow thin, and beare a &s;mall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, thickne&s;&s;e.</NOTE> depth with it. Which newes when <HI>Cy|rus</HI> heard, &s;tanding in the mids of the armie with his guard about him, he com|maunded the &s;ouldiers heavily armed, to di&s;play and &s;tretch out the &s;aid bat|talion from both<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, poynts.</NOTE> ends, and to goe off, clo&s;e by that part of the armie that &s;tood &s;till untill &s;uch time as both the &s;aid points raught unto him, and enclo|&s;ed the very mids. Which when they did: both they who kept their &s;tanding now that the bodie of the battaile was double in thickne&s;&s;e, as al&s;o tho&s;e that went from both ends, were more emboldened. For they that &s;tood &s;till, were pre&s;ently neere unto the enemies. But when by this manner of pa&s;&s;ing to and fro, they had brought both points togither: they &s;tood more &s;trong and con|fident, as well they that went off, by rea&s;on of them before, as they before al|&s;o, for that tho&s;e behind joyned unto them. By meanes of di&s;playing and &s;prea|ding the battaile in this manner: the be&s;t mu&s;t needs bee raunged formo&s;t and hinmo&s;t, but the wor&s;t ca&s;t into the mids. Which order of embattailing &s;ee|med to be well provided both for to fight, as al&s;o to keepe them from flight. Moreover, the hor&s;emen and light appointed skirmi&s;hers in the wings, approa|ched ever to the Generall &s;o much the neerer, as the maine battaile thus reen|forced and doubled, bare greater<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> thickne&s;&s;e and became deeper. After they were in this wi&s;e put in array, they gave backe from thence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">by little and little.</NOTE> foot by foot, &s;o farre as a dart &s;hot raught from the wall. But when they were once without their reach, they turned their faces toward the city: and verily at the fir&s;t, ha|ving &s;tepped &s;ome few paces forward, they &s;hifted full upon their &s;hields: and &s;tood &s;o, as they might behold the wall at full, and the farther they were off, they &s;hifted &s;o much thinner. Now when they thought them&s;elves to bee in &s;afety, they retired in a continued order togither, untill they were come unto their tents. And after they were encamped: <HI>Cyrus</HI> calling to him his be&s;t war|riours and men of action, &s;aid thus unto them.</P>
<P>My Friends and A&s;&s;ociates, we have viewed the city round about: and how it is po&s;&s;ible to force by a&s;&s;ault the wals, &s;o &s;trong and high withall, I cannot &s;ee. But this I &s;uppo&s;e, that the greater multitude of people there be within the City, &s;o long as they y&s;&s;ew not forth to fight, the &s;ooner &s;hall they be overta|ken with hunger. Vnle&s;&s;e therefore, yee can alleadge &s;ome other way, my ad|vi&s;e is, that pre&s;ently we lay &s;iege and beleaguer them. Then &s;pake <HI>Chry&s;antas:</HI> This river here which is above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, a quarter of a mile.</NOTE> 2. furlongs over: runneth it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">along the mids.</NOTE> through the mids of the city? Yes verily an&s;wered <HI>Gobryas,</HI> and &s;o deep it is withall, that two men &s;tanding one upon the head of another will not reach above the wa|ter: Whereby the city is better defended with the river than with the wals. Let the&s;e matters goe by, quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> then, unto <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> which are above our &s;trength, and after that we have with all &s;peed taken mea&s;ure, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity quarter our &s;elves accordingly, and goe in hand to dig a mighty deep and broad trench, to the end that we may have need, of as few warders as may be. Having mea&s;ured therefore all about the wals, leaving a &s;pace from the ri|ver &s;ufficient for great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, platformes</NOTE> bulwarks, hee digged an exceeding great trench round about the wall, ca&s;ting up the earth toward them&s;elves. Then, the fir&s;t thing that he did was to rai&s;e skonces hard to the river &s;ide, making their foundations upon Date trees, which tooke up no le&s;&s;e than<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> an acre in length. (For they will grow out in length more than &s;o) becau&s;e the nature of the Date trees is &s;uch,
<PB N="167" REF="94">that if they bee pre&s;&s;ed downe with any weight they will &s;well or bunch up|ward, after the manner of tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> great a&s;&s;es [backs] called Canthelij. Now, the&s;e trees he built upon of purpo&s;e, that hee might &s;eeme e&s;pecially, to lay &s;iege unto the city, and in ca&s;e the River &s;hould breake into the trench, yet it might not carry away the &s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> skant&s;es. He erected al&s;o many other turrets or skant&s;es upon the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> earth that was ca&s;t up, to the end he might have as many places for Sentinels and warders as po&s;&s;ibly he could.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or turrets.</NOTE><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or terrace.</NOTE></P>
<P>And thus verily were they imployed. But the <HI>Babylonians</HI> upon the wall, made a mocke at this manner of &s;iege, as who were &s;tored with victuals within, for 20. yeeres and more. Which when <HI>Cyrus</HI> heard, he divided his armie into 12. parts, that each part might by turnes watch and ward one moneth in the yeere. The <HI>Babylonians</HI> likewi&s;e hearing of that, derided them &s;o much the more, thinking this with them&s;elves, how the <HI>Phrygians,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. the Lydians.</NOTE> <HI>Lycians, Arabians</HI> and <HI>Cappadocians</HI> &s;hould haue the warding of them, all whom they &s;uppo&s;ed to be more friendly affected unto them&s;elves than to the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> And now by this time were the trenches digged and ca&s;t up. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> having intelligence that there was in <HI>Babylon</HI> &s;uch a fea&s;t &s;olemnized, whereat they u&s;e all to drinke, eate and banket all night long, thereupon &s;o &s;oone as it grew to be darke he tooke with him a number of men, and opened the heads of the trenches toward the ri|ver: Which done, the water in the night time flowed and ran into the trenches, and thereby, the chanell of the river, keeping his way through the city, became &s;o pa&s;&s;ible, as that it might be waded through by men. Whiles this was thus in hand about the river, <HI>Cyrus</HI> commaunded, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> millenarie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Chiliarchi o|ver 1000. men.</NOTE> Colonels as well of foot as hor&s;e, to come unto him, leading their regiments of thou|&s;ands 2. by 2. in ranke. As for the re&s;t, that were a&s;&s;ociats, he gave order to fol|low at their backs arraunged, as they were before. And they verily pre&s;ented them&s;elves accordingly. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> cau&s;ing officers and mini&s;ters both foot|men and hor&s;emen to enter into the drie part of the river, commaunded them to &s;ound whether the bottom thereof were firme ground and pa&s;&s;ible or no? And after they had brought word backe, that it might be waded through, hee a&s;&s;embled the Captaines as well of foot as hor&s;e, unto whom he made &s;uch a &s;peech as this. This river, my loving Friends, hath left his ordinary cour&s;e that leadeth into the City. Let us enter in therefore with confidence fearing nought, Con&s;idering that they again&s;t whom we now advance, be no other than the ve|ry &s;ame, whom when they were well friended and backed with a&s;&s;ociats, when they were all awake, &s;ober, armed and in order embattailed, we defaited. Where|as now, we march again&s;t them, what time as many of them are a&s;leepe, many drunke, and all out of order. But that they &s;hall perceive al&s;o, that we are got|ten within the City, they will be farre le&s;&s;e able to fight than now: For that they &s;hall be a&s;tonied and amazed at this unexpected &s;urpri&s;e. And if any man haply thinke, that wee &s;hall have a hote welcome at our fir&s;t entrance, for feare lea&s;t the town&s;men get up to the roufes of their hou&s;es, and from thence a&s;&s;aile us with &s;hot on every &s;ide, let this mo&s;t of all embolden you: For, if any of them &s;hall climbe up to their hou&s;e-tops, we have a God to helpe us, even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">i. Fire.</NOTE> <HI>Vulcane.</HI> For, the porches of their hou&s;es be &s;oone &s;et on fire, the dores are made of Date|tree-wood, and tho&s;e verni&s;hed and laid over with Bitumen, which will &s;oone catch fire and burne. As for us, good &s;tore we have of matches and torches, which will quickly kindle and make a great fire. We have pitch and hirds like|wi&s;e,
<PB N="168" REF="95">that will as &s;uddenly flame out. Whereby, it will come to pa&s;&s;e, that of nece&s;&s;itie they mu&s;t either for&s;ake their hou&s;es or bee &s;oone con&s;umed to a&s;hes. Goe to therefore and with good courage take armes. And I my &s;elfe in the name of God will lead you in this &s;ervice. As for you <HI>Gadatas</HI> and <HI>Gobryas:</HI> &s;hew us onely the wayes, for, yee know them full well: and &s;o &s;oone as we be entred into the Citie, guide us and bring us directly with all &s;peed to the Kings Palace.</P>
<P>And that verily, &s;aid the &s;ouldiers about <HI>Gobryas,</HI> can be no wonderfull mat|ter. For, the court gates will not be &s;hut: being as it is a time of banquetting: and the whole Citie this night, &s;eemeth altogither &s;et thereupon. But we &s;hall light upon the Warders, before the Palace gates, which are wont alwaies to be placed there, as a Corps du guard. Well, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> we mu&s;t not therefore &s;lacke our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, but goe with all &s;peed, that we may take them mo&s;t un|provided. The word was no &s;ooner &s;poken but they went forward. And looke, whom&s;oever they met in the way, they were wounded and &s;ome &s;laine out|right; others fled backe againe into the Citie, and part of them made out|cryes and &s;houts. Semblably, the &s;ouldiers about <HI>Gobryas</HI> and <HI>Gadatas,</HI> an&s;we|red them with like &s;houts, as if them&s;elves had beene drinking and banquetting as well as they. And &s;o marched they on in great ha&s;t, &s;o farreas to the Kings Palace. And verily <HI>Gadatas</HI> and <HI>Gobryas</HI> with their Companies being in ordi|nance of battaile, found the Court-gates fa&s;t &s;hut: but &s;uch as were appointed to encounter the Warders, ranne upon them drinking, as they were, by a great light [fire] and pre&s;ently dealt with them as with enemies, whereupon a|ro&s;e a huge noi&s;e and rumbling hurry: which hurliburly when they within heard, (for the King commanded to &s;ee what the matter was) certaine of them did &s;et open the gates and ranne forth. Then <HI>Gadatas</HI> his &s;ouldiers &s;eeing the gates &s;tanding wide open, ru&s;hed in, cha&s;ing them as they fled backe againe into the Palace, and beating them downe before them, untill they came as farre as to the King him&s;elf, whom they find &s;tanding with his cimiter that he had, drawn. And him, the &s;ouldiers about <HI>Gadatas</HI> and <HI>Gobryas,</HI> being many in number over|came and di&s;putched. They al&s;o about him were &s;laine every mothers &s;onne: whiles one oppo&s;ed &s;omewhat in their way, another did what he could to flie and e&s;cape, and in one word whiles every man defended him&s;elfe by what meanes he might. In this meane while, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;ent forth certaine Cornets of hor&s;emen into the &s;treets, with commandement to kill whom&s;oever they found out of their hou&s;es: but to as many as kept within doores, he made Proclama|tion, by the mouth of tho&s;e that were skilfull in the Syriacke tongue to abide &s;till within hou&s;e: And looke, who was taken abroad without doores, there was no remedie but dye he mu&s;t. And thus did they accordingly. Then came to them <HI>Gadatas</HI> and <HI>Gobryas:</HI> who fir&s;t of all wor&s;hipped the Gods by way of thank&s;giving, for that they were revenged of that wicked and impious Ty|rant: then weeping abundantly and leaping for very joy, they ki&s;&s;ed both the hands and feet of <HI>Cyrus.</HI> When it was day light, They that kept the fortre&s;&s;es and Citadels within, perceiving that the Citie was wonne, and the King &s;laine, rendred up their holds likewi&s;e. <HI>Cyrus</HI> immediatly &s;eized them into his owne hands, and &s;ent garri&s;on &s;ouldiers, togither with Captaines into them. Hee gave leave unto tho&s;e, for to bury their dead, that were of kinne or neere allied unto them. Al&s;o hee commanded the Heraulds to make proclamation: That<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">: That would not bee negle|cted, yet goe we mu&s;t, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="169" REF="95">all the Babylonians &s;hould bring out and deliver up their Armes. And where|&s;oever in any hou&s;e there &s;hould be found harnois or weapons, he commanded as many as were therein to be put to death. So they brought forth their armes accordingly which <HI>Cyrus</HI> be&s;towed in the forts, that they might be in readi|ne&s;&s;e again&s;t the time of need. Which done, the fir&s;t thing that he went in hand with, was to call for the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Prie&s;t.</NOTE> Magi. And becau&s;e the Citie was taken by force of armes, he charged preci&s;ely, that the fir&s;t fruits of the &s;poile, togi|ther with all the &s;hrines and chappels, &s;hould be &s;elected apart for the Gods. After this, as well private hou&s;es as &s;tately and princely edifices, he di&s;tributed among tho&s;e whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have had a hand in that exploit. And thus as it was thought good and decreed, he awarded the be&s;t unto the be&s;t. But if there were any man, that imagined he had a le&s;&s;e part than he de&s;erved, he willed him to come forth and declare &s;o much. Moreover hee publi&s;hed by way of proclamation, that the Babylonians &s;hould till the grounds, pay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, rent.</NOTE> tribute, yeeld obedience and &s;ervice to them, unto whom every one was allotted. Further|more he proclaimed thus much, that both Per&s;ians and tho&s;e who any wayes communicated with them: yea and as many of the Confederates al&s;o as cho&s;e to &s;tay with him, they &s;hould terme as their Lords and Ma&s;ters to whom they befell.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed his Kingdome in Babylon: in&s;tituted the honour and ve|neration of Kings: entertained Eunuches for the &s;ervice of his hou&s;e: and Per&s;ians for the guard of his per&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all this, <HI>Cyrus</HI> being now de&s;irous to compo&s;e him&s;elfe &s;o, for his owne per&s;on, as be&s;eemed the State of a King, by the advi&s;e of his friends, thought it good, that with lea&s;t envie he might be &s;eene &s;eldome, and with greate&s;t Maje&s;tie. This he wrought in this manner. Fir&s;t, by delight he tooke up his &s;tanding, and gave audience to as many, as had any thing to &s;ay unto him: Whom, &s;o &s;oone as he had an&s;wered and di&s;patched, he &s;ent away. Folke perceiving that they were thus admitted and had free acce&s;&s;e, flocked a|bout him in multitudes infinite. Thus whiles they prea&s;&s;ed forward and thru&s;t to come neere unto him, there grew much &s;tirre and fighting withall: in &s;uch &s;ort as his Serjeants and Officers did all they could to voide the numbers of them, and to make way them&s;elves to come unto him. And if any even of his friends putting the people by, came within &s;ight, <HI>Cyrus</HI> would reach forth his hand and draw them to him, &s;aying in this wi&s;e: My friends, &s;tay a while un|till I have di&s;patched this multitude out of the way, and then &s;hall wee com|mune togither at ea&s;e. So, his friends gave attendance: But the concour&s;e of people conflowed &s;till more and more, &s;o that he was prevented by the evening, before he could have lei&s;ure to conferre with his friends. Therefore &s;aid <HI>Cyrus</HI> unto them. It is hight time now my friends (for this day) to breake up the a&s;|&s;embly. To morrow morning faile not but come early. For I would gladly &s;peake with you. When the&s;e his friends heard him &s;ay &s;o, they departed wil|lingly, and that apace, as having beene puni&s;hed all day long, and wanted even the nece&s;&s;aries of this life. The next morning <HI>Cyrus</HI> came againe to the &s;ame
<PB N="170" REF="96">place. But then, he was be&s;et with a greater throng by farre of people, &s;uch as were de&s;irous to have acce&s;&s;e unto him, and much &s;ooner were they there, than his friends afore&s;aid. But he having placed all about, a great guard of Per&s;ian Halberds and Parti&s;anes, gave commandement, that none &s;hould be &s;o hardy as to pre&s;ent them&s;elves unto him, &s;ave onely tho&s;e his favourites, and the chiefe Rulers as well of Per&s;ians, as of his A&s;&s;ociates. Who when they were all met togither, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;pake unto them in this manner.</P>
<P>My friends and Confederates, Albeit no cau&s;e we have to blame the Gods, for that hitherto, we have not archieved all that we wi&s;hed and prayed for, Yet, if the performing of brave exploits bring this withall, that a man cannot re|po&s;e him&s;elfe as he would, nor take delight and &s;olace with his friends, Fare|well for my part, all &s;uch felicitie. For, both ye&s;terday ye perceived, that from the very morning betimes, wee began to give audience unto &s;uiters, and gave not over before eventide: and now al&s;o yee &s;ee, the&s;e are here come farre more in number than tho&s;e ye&s;terday, to put mee unto new trouble. And therefore, if a man &s;hould give way unto the&s;e, I accompt hereby, that little u&s;e yee &s;hall have of me, or I of you. And &s;ure I am, that of mine owne &s;elfe I &s;hall have very &s;mall or none at all. There is al&s;o, quoth hee, another thing be&s;ide, that I &s;ee, very ridiculous. For, how&s;oever for mine owne part I &s;tand affected to you as I ought, yet of all the&s;e that throng here about mee, I know in manner not one, and they nathele&s;&s;e are all of this di&s;po&s;ition, that if by thru&s;ting and importunitie they can prevent you, they will pre&s;ume to obtaine at my hands their reque&s;ts and be &s;erved before you. But I would think it meet and rea&s;ona|ble, that if any man have need of me, he &s;hould make meanes to you my friends, &s;eeke your favour, and reque&s;t you to bring them to mee. But &s;ome man haply will aske me why I did not carry my &s;elfe &s;o at fir&s;t, but lay open &s;o, as I did, to all commers? To whom I an&s;were, that I knew the &s;tate of warre affaires was &s;uch, as it behooved not a Soveraine Commander, to be wanting either in ta|king knowledge of all things requi&s;ite, or in execution of &s;uch exploits as by any occurrents be pre&s;ented. And if Generals them&s;elves were &s;eldome &s;eene abroad, I &s;uppo&s;e that many affaires would have pa&s;&s;ed by, which were meet to be put in execution. But now, &s;eeing that this warre &s;o toyle&s;ome and labori|ous is layd a&s;leepe, my very &s;oule deemeth it to &s;tand with equitie, that it al&s;o may have now &s;ome repo&s;e. And therefore &s;ithence I am in doubt my &s;elfe what cour&s;e to take, that not onely our owne e&s;tate, but theirs al&s;o, of whom we ought to take the charge, may &s;tand upright: let &s;ome of you advi&s;e, what in his conceit he &s;ees mo&s;t behoovefull. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had delivered the&s;e words, <HI>Artabazus</HI> &s;tood up, him I meane who &s;ometime claimed kinred of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and thus &s;pake. Now I a&s;&s;ure you, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you have done pa&s;&s;ing well to enter into this di&s;cour&s;e. For, my &s;elfe even from my childhood began to de&s;ire your friend&s;hip. But &s;eeing how you &s;tood in no need of me, I dur&s;t not be &s;o bold as to come unto you. Afterwards when you hapned to reque&s;t mee upon a time frankly to relate unto the Medes a me&s;&s;age from <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> I argued thus with my &s;elfe, that if I performed cheerefully this &s;ervice for you, I &s;hould be very inward with you, yea and enjoy your conference when&s;oever I would. And verily that affaire I executed &s;o, as that you commended mee highly therefore. After this, the Hyrcanians were the fir&s;t that joyned with us in amitie, what time as wee were exceeding de&s;irous of Allies, &s;o that wee em|braced
<PB N="171" REF="96">their Societie, as if we had beene de&s;irous to carry them about in out armes. And who then but they? When this was done, and our enemies campe forced, I thought then, you had no lei&s;ure to attend me: neither could I blame you for it, but beare with you. Then comes mee <HI>Gobryas,</HI> and he became a friend unto us, whereat I did rejoyce: after him, <HI>Gadatas</HI> likewi&s;e: whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e, that &s;till it was an hard matter for mee to be acquainted with you. Semblably, when the Sacans and Cadu&s;ians became our confederates, good cau&s;e there was that they &s;hould be honourably entertained. For why? they honoured you. But after that wee were returned thither againe from whence we fir&s;t &s;et out in our expedition, becau&s;e I &s;aw you much bu&s;ied about the erecting of a Cavallery, about Chariots, Fabricks and Engins of Artillery, I made this accompt, that when you had beene once pa&s;t this care and trouble, you would have beene at lei&s;ure to regard mee. Howbeit, when the fearefull newes came, that men of all nations were banded &amp; in ho&s;tile manner a&s;&s;embled again&s;t us, I under&s;tood very well, that the&s;e were affaires of right great impor|tance: But yet, if God gave once good &s;ucce&s;&s;e therein, I was per&s;waded fully in my heart, that you and I both &s;hould then conver&s;e mutually togither. And now that wee have fought a great field and wonne the victory: Now that wee have brought <HI>Sardes</HI> and <HI>Crae&s;us</HI> under our &s;ubjection: Now that we have for|ced Babylon, &s;ubdued and conquered all before us, yet could not I ye&s;terday, &s;o helpe me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That is, the Sunne.</NOTE> Methres, have had acce&s;&s;e unto you, but that I laid well about me with my fi&s;ts again&s;t many that &s;tood in my way. But when you tooke and drew me once by the hand, willing me to &s;tay by you, then, for&s;ooth, I was well holp up, abiding with you all day long without meat &amp; drinke. Now therefore, if by any meanes it be po&s;&s;ible, that we who have done you be&s;t &s;ervice, may likewi&s;e be chiefe about you and enjoy you mo&s;t, it is well: if not, then will I denounce eft &s;oones in your name, that all depart from you, excepting us onely, who from the beginning have beene your friends and followers. At the&s;e words, both <HI>Cyrus</HI> and many others al&s;o laughed heartily. But <HI>Chry&s;tantas</HI> the Per&s;ian aro&s;e and &s;pake in this wi&s;e. Heretofore, by good rea&s;on, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you have &s;hewed your &s;elfe abroad in the eyes of all men, as well for tho&s;e cau&s;es, which your &s;elfe haue alleadged, as al&s;o becau&s;e we were not they, whom you were chiefely and above the re&s;t to re&s;pect. For, we were pre&s;ent al&s;o for our owne particular. But nece&s;&s;ary it was for you by all meanes po&s;&s;ible, to winne the multitude, to the end that every one might be mo&s;t willing to undergoe the &s;ame travailes and perils togither with us. And now, &s;eeing your condition is not otherwi&s;e, but you may oblige others al&s;o unto you, whom you thinke meet, it is now high time for you to have the benefit of your hou&s;e and home. For otherwi&s;e, what fruit &s;hould you reape by your Soveraine rule, if you a|lone want your owne dwelling place, than which there is no land or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the world more &s;acred, more &s;ecret, more proper and familiar? Moreover, thinke you not, quoth he, that even we al&s;o blu&s;h for &s;hame, to &s;ee you re&s;olute|ly for to live abroad, keeping our &s;elves within doores, and &s;eeming to be in better ca&s;e than you are? When <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> had opened his minde in the&s;e termes, many there were who accorded thereto. Whereupon <HI>Cyrus</HI> entred the Royall Palace; and here they that brought the trea&s;ure taken in Sardes, rendred up the &s;ame. After hee was entred in, Fir&s;t, hee &s;acrificed unto <HI>Ve&s;ta;</HI> then to <HI>Iupiter</HI> King, and to what other God &s;oever the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Magi.</NOTE> Prie&s;ts directed him.</P>
<PB N="172" REF="97">
<P>The&s;e complements fini&s;hed, he began to apply his minde, to the &s;ettling of other affaires. And taking into con&s;ideration, what a charge he undertooke in going about to governe many men: and intending to keepe re&s;iance in a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Babylon.</NOTE> Ci|tie, which among others of great name, was mo&s;t renowmed and &s;tood &s;o ill affected unto him, as the mo&s;t enemy Citie in the world could be unto a man: pondering I &s;ay the&s;e things in his minde, hee thought it requi&s;ite, to reteine a guard about his per&s;on. Con&s;idering al&s;o full well, that men in no place can &s;ooner and ea&s;ier be overcome, than at eating and drinking, bathing, lying abed and &s;leeping, he did ca&s;t about, whom in the&s;e premi&s;&s;es he might keepe about him mo&s;t tru&s;ty. Hee thought withall, that the man could never be true and faithfull, who loved another more then him who &s;tood in need of his guard. And therefore he ob&s;erved, that &s;uch as had children, wives of their owne fitted to their minds, or beloved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Catamites, were by nature forced to affect them mo&s;t. On the other &s;ide, &s;eeing that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Guelded men.</NOTE> Ennuches wanted all the&s;e, he concluded that they would &s;et mo&s;t by them, that were able to enrich them mo&s;t, by whom al&s;o they might be relieved if they were wronged, yea and advanced to greate&s;t honours. And he &s;uppo&s;ed, there would none goe beyond him&s;elfe, in conferring benefits and favours upon &s;uch. Furthermore, in regard that Eu|nuches bee of ba&s;e accompt among other men, for that very cau&s;e, they had need of a Lord and Ma&s;ter to be backed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by. For, there is not one, but would in all things deeme him&s;elfe worthy to bee in better place than a guelded Eunuch, unle&s;&s;e &s;ome better thing be a barre thereto: But, that Eunuch who is faithfull to his Ma&s;ter, findeth no impediment, but he may be chiefe a|bout him. And whereas in &s;ome one this rea&s;on may mo&s;t of all prevaile to the contrary, namely, that &s;uch evirate per&s;ons become weaklings and cowards: <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe was not of that minde. And here he argued &s;trongly from in|&s;tance in other living creatures. For, hor&s;es be otherwi&s;e fierce and untractable, if they once be guelded, how ever they leave their biting and cea&s;&s;e to be fram|pold, yet are they neverthele&s;&s;e &s;erviceable in the warres: and Buls if they be libbed and made Oxen, are not &s;o &s;tomackfull and &s;tubborne as they were: howbeit they abate nothing of their &s;trength and abilitie to worke. Sembla|bly Dogs if their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">If they be cut, or &s;played. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> cullions be taken from them, u&s;e no more to leave and lo&s;e their Ma&s;ters, but are never the wor&s;e to watch and keepe the hou&s;e, no nor to hunt abroad. Even &s;o it is with men in this kinde: more mild and gentle they are, being bereft of this fle&s;hly lu&s;t: yet be they never the more negligent, in the execution of &s;uch things as they are enjoyned to doe, nor le&s;&s;e indu&s;trious in &s;ervice on hor&s;ebacke, nor one jote di&s;abled for launcing their darts, ne yet le&s;&s;e de&s;irous of honour. Nay rather, both in martiall feats and in their hun|ting, they &s;hew evidently, that they have kept &s;till in their hearts a certaine emu|lation and de&s;ire of victory. And that they be tru&s;ty withall, they have &s;hewed good proofe in the murders of their Ma&s;ters. For, none there be, that have gi|ven better te&s;timony of their approoved fidelity, in the calamities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their Lords, than Eunuches. And &s;ay, it may be thought that they have lo&s;t &s;ome bodily &s;trength [being thus evirate] yet in the warres the &s;ame is &s;uppli|ed by u&s;e of weapon, which make the weake and &s;trong all one. Vpon the&s;e con&s;iderations, having begun fir&s;t at his Porters and doore-keepers, hee cho&s;e for the Squires of his body, Eunuches all. And for that he thought this guard not &s;ufficient, to make head again&s;t a multitude of tho&s;e, that carried an ho&s;tile
<PB N="173" REF="97">minde again&s;t him, he devi&s;ed, whom he might be&s;ide elect out of others, to be mo&s;t faithfull Warders for his Court and Palace. Knowing therefore, that the Per&s;ians remaining at home in their country, lived exceeding hardly by rea|&s;on of povertie, and tooke exce&s;&s;ive paines, as well in regard of the rough and hard &s;oile of Per&s;ia, as for that they maintaine them&s;elves by their own labour: hee &s;uppo&s;ed that they above all others would mo&s;t embrace this condition of life with him. Hereupon he draweth out of them a guard of ten thou&s;and Pen&s;ioners, who night and day &s;hould watch and ward round about his Palace, &s;o long as hee abode there at home: and in ca&s;e hee went forth any whither, march al&s;o on either &s;ide of him, in good array and well appointed. And be|cau&s;e he thought there was need of garri&s;on-&s;ouldiers for all Babylon through|out, and tho&s;e &s;ufficient per&s;ons, whether him&s;elfe remained within the Citie, or were gone forth, he placed a &s;tanding garri&s;on in Babylon, whom he appointed to receive their wages at the Babylonians hands, for that he intended to keepe them disfurni&s;hed of all things, to the end they might be brought very low, and &s;o by con&s;equence, with lea&s;t adoe be held in awe. And verily, this &s;et watch and ward then appointed for his owne per&s;on and for the Citie of Ba|bylon, continueth &s;till in the &s;ame manner even to this day. Moreover, ca&s;ting about, how he might hold his whole Empire thus atchieved, as al&s;o enlarge the &s;ame by further conque&s;t, hee thought that the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mercenaries.</NOTE> &s;tipendiaries, were not &s;o much better in valour as fewer in number than his &s;ubjects: and therefore de|termined to retaine &s;till about him &s;uch valiant Knights, as by the help of God had gained &s;o famous victories, and to take order that they might be trained &s;till to the perfection of prowe&s;&s;e. And becau&s;e hee would not &s;eeme to com|maund them, but that of their owne accord, (as deeming the&s;e things to bee mo&s;t commendable) they might per&s;i&s;t therein, and with all diligence en&s;ue vertue, he called unto him, the above&s;aid Peeres: the principall men be&s;ides of Armes and action, as al&s;o tho&s;e, whom he thought mo&s;t meet and worthy to be part-takers both of travailes and availes.

<P>MY deare friends and loving confederates, wee yeeld unto God, as our bounden duty is, exceeding great thanks, for that he hath granted unto us tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings to enjoy, which we thought our &s;elves right worthy of. For now, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed we are of a large country and fertile &s;oyle: Lords we be al&s;o over them, who by tilling and husbanding the &s;ame, &s;hall finde us and maintaine our living. Hou&s;es wee have al&s;o and the &s;ame well furni&s;hed with uten&s;iles nece&s;&s;ary. Neither thinke any of you, that in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all this, he hol|deth the goods or lands of other men. For, a perpetuall law this is throughout the world, that when their Citie is wonne, who &s;tand out in armes, as well the bodies of them within that Citie, as their goods and whole e&s;tates be due unto the winners. And therefore, unju&s;tly &s;hall yee not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e tho&s;e things that yee hold: but if yee permit tho&s;e enemies to retaine ought, it is of your meere
<PB N="174" REF="98">courte&s;ie, that yee tooke not the &s;ame quite from them. But as touching that which is henceforth to be done, this verily is my determination. If we give our &s;elves to idlene&s;&s;e, and the voluptuous &s;en&s;ualitie of cowardly per&s;ons (who are of opinion that there is no other mi&s;ery, but labour and paines taking, like as, to live at ea&s;e and exempt from labour, is the onely plea&s;ure and true felicitie) then I avow and &s;ay, wee &s;hall quickly be of no reckoning nor worth, to our owne &s;elves, yea and &s;oone forgoe all the&s;e goods that were enjoyed. For, to have beene once valiant men, is not &s;ufficient, to the perpetuitie and perfection of valour, unle&s;&s;e a man daily per&s;evere therein, even to the end. But like as other Arts and Sciences if they be forlet, grow to be of le&s;&s;e e&s;teeme: and our very bodies otherwi&s;e healthy, and in good plight, if they be let loo&s;e to &s;louth and idlene&s;&s;e, turne eft&s;oones to be di&s;ea&s;ed and mi&s;liking: even &s;o temperance, con|tinence and fortitude, when&s;oever a man &s;lacketh their exerci&s;e by di&s;u&s;e, grow &s;hortly to vice and lewdne&s;&s;e. Therefore wee mu&s;t not in any wi&s;e be remi&s;&s;e and take our ea&s;e, ne yet abandon our &s;elves to the plea&s;ures and delights pre|&s;ented unto us. For I a&s;&s;ure you, in my conceit, how&s;oever to gaine a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Empire.</NOTE> king|dome is a great matter, yet a much greater peece of worke it is, when one hath wonne it to hold it. For, oftentimes his fortune is to obtaine it, who &s;heweth him&s;elfe onely but bold and venterous: but to retaine and keepe &s;till the &s;ame which he hath gotten, cannot be effected, without the gift of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> temperance and of continency, nor without much &s;tudy and diligence. Vnder&s;tanding there|fore all this; we ought now to exerci&s;e vertue much more than we did, before we attained to this great e&s;tate: Yea, and know we mu&s;t that a man &s;hall have then the greate&s;t number to envie him, to lay wait for him, yea and to become his mortall enemies, when he hath mo&s;t in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: e&s;pecially if he hath gained both wealth and ob&s;ervance, (as wee have done) from men again&s;t their wills. Certes, we are to thinke, that God will be on our &s;ide. For, unju&s;t|ly we have not come by all this, nor by treacherous &s;lights, but being forlayed our &s;elves, revenged wee are for our owne wrongs. That therefore, which next after this is be&s;t, let us endeavour to be furni&s;hed with: And that is this, to en|joy our Empire by being better our &s;elves than tho&s;e, whom wee rule. As for heat and cold, meats and drinks, labour and &s;leepe, common they mu&s;t be of nece&s;&s;itie to us with our very &s;ervants: Howbeit let us &s;o communicate therein with them, that we endeavour fir&s;t and principally, even in the&s;e matters to be &s;eene more vertuous than they. But in martiall di&s;cipline, and military exer|ci&s;es, we ought in no wi&s;e to communicate with them, whom we are minded to make our<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. As workefolke and husband|men.</NOTE> labourers and tributaries: For, in the&s;e exerci&s;es it behooveth us to goe beyond them; knowing thus much, that God hath &s;hewed the&s;e meanes unto men, for to be the in&s;truments of liberty and ble&s;&s;edne&s;&s;e. And like as we have &s;tripped them of their armour, &s;o wee our &s;elves ought never to be di&s;ar|med, as knowing this, that they who have alwaies weapons neere&s;t at hand, may make mo&s;t accompt to hold as their owne, what&s;oever they de&s;ire. Now, if any there be, that rea&s;oneth thus, what are wee the better for effecting that which we would, if wee mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;itie endure hunger, thir&s;t, cares and travailes &s;till? To him I an&s;wer, We ought thus much to learne, that good things bring &s;o much the more joy with them, by how much the toyle was greater that went before the atchievement thereof. For, travaile is meat alone and &s;auce to valiant and hardy men: And without this one thing, namely, the need of that which one obtaineth, nothing be it never &s;o co&s;tly can be provided, to make it
<PB N="175" REF="98">&s;weet and &s;avory. And if tho&s;e things which men de&s;ire mo&s;t, God hath from heaven furni&s;hed us with: but that the &s;ame may &s;eeme mo&s;t delectable, &s;ome one provideth for him&s;elfe: &s;uch a man &s;hall have this advantage, and be in bet|ter ca&s;e, than they that live more &s;lenderly, in that he &s;hall get the mo&s;t tooth|&s;ome cates, when he is hungry, enjoy the plea&s;ante&s;t drinks when he is thir&s;tie, and take the &s;weete&s;t repo&s;e, when he hath need of re&s;t. Which being &s;o, thus I conclude and &s;ay: That we ought now to &s;traine our &s;elves to the uttermo&s;t, for to play the parts of good and hone&s;t men: to the end that we may have in the be&s;t manner and with mo&s;t contentment, the u&s;e of the&s;e benefits, and not ta&s;te of that which of all things in the world is mo&s;t grievous. For it is nothing &s;o grievous, never to have gotten good things, as heavy and irke&s;ome to forgoe the &s;ame, after a man hath once had them. Furthermore, this al&s;o yee are to con&s;ider, what preten&s;e or colour we have to be more idle and negligent here|after than heretofore? Is it, for that wee are now in place of &s;overaine com|mand? But it is not meet, that the Ruler &s;hould be wor&s;e than the &s;ubject. Or is it becau&s;e wee &s;eeme to be in an happier e&s;tate now, than beforetime? And will a man &s;ay indeed, that in pro&s;peritie Cowardi&s;e is to be borne with, and pardoned? Or, becau&s;e we have gotten &s;laves to &s;erve us, &s;hall we cha&s;ti&s;e them if they proove lewd and naught? But how befitteth it him, who is bad and blocki&s;h him&s;elfe, to puni&s;h others for lewdne&s;&s;e and &s;tupiditie? Moreover, I would have you to thinke of this al&s;o. We foreca&s;t to feed and maintaine ma|ny, that keepe our hou&s;es and guard our bodies. And how can it otherwi&s;e be but a &s;tarke &s;hame for us to imagine that we ought to entertaine others for the guard and &s;afetie of our per&s;ons, and be not a guard to &s;quire and defend our &s;elves? For, this we ought a&s;&s;uredly to know, that there is no defen&s;e or pro|tection like to this, as when a man him&s;elfe is hone&s;t and vertuous. For, that of nece&s;&s;itie mu&s;t goe alwaies with him and beare him companie. But, who&s;oever is void of vertue, in all congruitie, no thing be&s;ides can pro&s;per and &s;peed well under his hand. What is then to be done? &s;ay I, and where &s;hould we practi&s;e vertue? wherein is our &s;tudy and indu&s;try to be employed? I will tell you, my friends, no new and &s;trange thing: but, like as in Per&s;ia, the noble Gentle|men called <HI>Homotimi,</HI> conver&s;e about the State and Princes Court; &s;o, I pro|nounce, that we who &s;emblably are all in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> equall honour, ought to make our abode here and be&s;tow our labour in the &s;ame affaires and occa&s;ions, that wee were there employed in. And as for you here in pre&s;ence, yee ought to have your eyes upon me and to con&s;ider, whether I am continually occupied in &s;uch duties as belong unto mee. And I likewi&s;e will ob&s;erve you as well. And ve|rily, whom I &s;hall perceive to apply their minds unto good actions, tho&s;e will I honour and reward. Moreover, the children that &s;hall de&s;cend from us, in|&s;truct wee here and bring up in this Court. For, both we &s;hall be better if we &s;hew our &s;elves unto our children, as the be&s;t precedents to follow: and our children al&s;o cannot ea&s;ily, though they would, proove naught and vicious, when they &s;hall neither &s;ee nor heare any filthine&s;&s;e and di&s;hone&s;ty, but &s;pend the whole day continually in vertuous and hone&s;t exerci&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> ordered the State of his Court. What in&s;titution of his hee recom|mended to his Courtiers. The manner that hee u&s;ed in teaching them how to live devoutly to Godward, and to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in all manner of vertue toward men.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN <HI>Cyrus</HI> had made this &s;peech, <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> &s;tood up and &s;pake in this wi&s;e. Many times el&s;e, my Friends, have I ob&s;er|ved, That a good Prince nothing at all differeth from a good Father. For, as Fathers provide for their children, that they never want ought that good is, &s;o <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;eemeth now unto mee, for to advi&s;e to tho&s;e things, whereby e&s;pecially we may live in perpetuall weale and happine&s;&s;e. But, for as much as he hath de|livered his mind not &s;o fully, as it behooved, I will endevour to open the &s;ame more at large, and in&s;truct therein &s;uch as be ignorant. For, con&s;ider with your &s;elves what enemie-&s;tate could ever be wonne by them, that were not obedient to their Prince? What Friend-City kept, by &s;uch as did not obey? What army of di&s;obedient &s;ouldiers was ever able to get the victory? By what meanes more may men in battaile be defaited and lo&s;e the field, than when each one begins to &s;eeke a way by him&s;elfe for his owne &s;afety? What good exploit be&s;ides can bee performed by tho&s;e that obey not their &s;uperiours? What Citie can otherwi&s;e be orderly governed? what hou&s;es pre&s;erved? or how el&s;e can &s;hips arrive at their de&s;ired haven? And even we our &s;elves by what meanes more are we come to that wealth which now we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, than by obedience to our Ru|lers? For, hereby it came to pa&s;&s;e that with &s;peed we touched at what place we &s;hould: and following our Captaines as we did in number togither, no man was able to &s;tand in our way and abide our force. To conclude, we have done no|thing by the halves, but fully accompli&s;hed all that we were commaunded. If then, it be evident, That to obey a Prince and Soveraigne, availeth mo&s;t to the atraining of wealth and honour: Wote well al&s;o, that the &s;ame is the be&s;t way to keep the &s;aid good things as we ought. And heretofore verily many men ruled us, when we governed none: but now the &s;tate of you here pre&s;ent is &s;uch, as that yee be all Commaunders, &s;ome of more, &s;ome of fewer. Like as therefore, yee
<PB N="177" REF="99">thinke it meet and requi&s;ite, that yee &s;hould rule your &s;ervants under you: even &s;o let us our &s;elves, obey tho&s;e unto whom by duty wee are bound to be obei|&s;ant. But thus much difference ought there to be betweene us and &s;ervants, that whereas they doe &s;ervice unto their ma&s;ters again&s;t their wils, we ought of our owne accords, (in ca&s;e we would be free indeed) to doe that which is of mo&s;t worth. And this &s;hall you find quoth he, that even there, where the State is not governed by way of Monarchie, that Common-wealth is never by enemies brought under &s;ubjection, which is mo&s;t willing to obey the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rulers.</NOTE> Magi&s;trates. Let us therefore give attendance as <HI>Cyrus</HI> willeth us, at this our Soveraignes Court: and exerci&s;e our &s;elves in tho&s;e matters, whereby principally we may be able to hold &s;uch things as ought to be pre&s;erved: Let us be pre&s;t to &s;erve <HI>Cyrus</HI> at all a&s;&s;aies, and in his affaires what&s;oever. For, this we are to know very well, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly find ought, wherein he may u&s;e our helping hand for his owne benefit, but our part al&s;o will be therein. The &s;elfe&s;ame things, I &s;ay, will be to us al&s;o commodious, like as we have the &s;ame enemies and no other. When <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> had delivered the&s;e words, many others likewi&s;e, as well <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> as Allies ro&s;e up and approoved what he had &s;aid. Whereupon there pa&s;&s;ed a decree, That<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Homotimi, the Peeres.</NOTE> the Honorable per&s;ons and Gentlemen of quality, &s;hould continually wait at Court, and tender their &s;ervice unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> in all occa&s;ions, as he thought good, untill he gave them their di&s;charge. And as it was ordai|ned then, eve~ &s;o at this day ob&s;erved it is of tho&s;e, who are under the Empire of the King of <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> They frequent right dutifully the Palaces of their Princes. And as in this pre&s;ent treati&s;e it is declared, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> in&s;tituted a forme of Empire, whereby he might pre&s;erve the &s;ame firme to him&s;elfe and to the <HI>Per&s;ians:</HI> even &s;o, the Kings his &s;ucce&s;&s;ours, from time to time retaine the &s;ame ordinances, and doe likewi&s;e at this day. And verily it falleth out herein as in other things. The better that the Prince is, the more &s;incerely are the auncient ordinances of the State kept: and the wor&s;e he is, the more untowardly goe all proceedings. Well, tho&s;e honourable per&s;ons repaired ordinarily to the Court-gates of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> mounted upon great hor&s;es, with their launces accordingly: For that this or|der was &s;o decreed, by tho&s;e chiefe men of marke, who togither with him had made this conque&s;t of the Empire.</P>
<P>Howbeit <HI>Cyrus</HI> afterward in&s;tituted other officers, unto whom he committed the menaging of other affaires: as who had under him both receivers of his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Finances.</NOTE> re|venewes, and &s;tewards al&s;o for the disbur&s;ing of his expen&s;es, Ma&s;ters and Over&s;eers of his works, keepers of his demaines and trea&s;ure, and purveiours of nece&s;&s;aries for diet and hou&s;-keeping. Moreover he appointed certaine E&s;cueries of the Stable for his hor&s;es, ma&s;ters of Venerie and Sergeants of his hounds, &s;uch as he thought had skill and dexterity, to traine and fit the&s;e bea&s;ts for his owne u&s;e and purpo&s;e. As for tho&s;e per&s;ons whom he was minded to retaine next about him, for &s;ociety in pre&s;erving his owne happy e&s;tate, and who might become right excellent in their place, he betooke not this choice and charge unto others, but thought that care belonged to him&s;elfe: For, hee wi&s;t very well, that if at any time he were to fight a field, he mu&s;t out of all that number, elect tho&s;e for his neere&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tants and tru&s;ty officers, with whom he had par|taken in greate&s;t daungers. He knew likewi&s;e, that out of them he mu&s;t choo&s;e his Centurions and Colonels as well of footmen as of hor&s;emen. And &s;ay, there were at any time need of Generals in his owne ab&s;ence, he con&s;idered that
<PB N="178" REF="100">out of the&s;e they were to be &s;ent. Moreover, he was not ignorant, that &s;ome of the&s;e he &s;hould imploy as Pre&s;idents under him of Cities, and Deputy Rulers of whole Provinces: others al&s;o to be &s;ent forth in Emba&s;&s;age. For that hee thought it a matter of greate&s;t importance, to treat and negotiate by the meanes of them, and &s;o to obtaine what was requi&s;ite without warre and force of armes. Now, if they, who&s;e &s;ervice was to be u&s;ed, in the effecting of his weightie&s;t af|faires, were not &s;uch as they ought to be, he &s;uppo&s;ed it would not be well with his royall e&s;tate: But if they were as they &s;hould be, then he &s;uppo&s;ed all would pro&s;per with him. Being &s;ettled therefore in this opinion, hee bent his mind wholly thereunto. Furthermore, of this judgement he was, that him&s;elfe ought &s;emblably to practi&s;e vertue: For, he thought it unpo&s;&s;ible for a man not qua|lified in his owne per&s;on, as he &s;hould be, to excite others to brave and lawda|ble actions. And in pondering all the&s;e points, he perceived that the contriving and compa&s;&s;ing of &s;o high de&s;ignes required principally time and lea&s;ure. And therefore he &s;uppo&s;ed, that he might not in any wi&s;e neglect the provident care about revenues of the Crowne: as wi&s;ely for e&s;teeming, that in the wealding of &s;o great a State, there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be much expen&s;e. Againe, con&s;idering that he had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his owne demaine, if he were in per&s;on evermore bu&s;ied about them, hee knew it would be an occa&s;ion to withdraw his mind quite from the care of pre&s;erving the &s;afety of the whole Empire. Ca&s;ting therefore how he might well order his owne oeconomicall &s;tate, and him&s;elfe enjoy re&s;t, he looked in &s;ome &s;ort into the order and di&s;cipline of military af|faires. For in warre the Decurions for the mo&s;t part take charge of the Decuries: the Caporals over&s;ee the Decurions: the Colonels of thou&s;ands, the &s;aid Ca|porals: The leaders of ten thou&s;and, tho&s;e &s;aid Colonels. Whereby it com|meth to pa&s;&s;e, that albeit there be many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">ten thou&s;ands</NOTE> miriades of men in an armie, yet there is not one &s;ouldier of them all, but he is regarded and &s;eene unto. So that when the Lord Generall him&s;elfe is di&s;po&s;ed to employ his armie, &s;ufficient it is to give charge unto the Myriarches [or Commaunders of ten thou&s;ands.] <HI>Cyrus</HI> con&s;idering the rea&s;on of this order in military affaires, framed thereto &s;um|marily his dome&s;ticall matters. And by this meanes, when he conferred him|&s;elfe but with a few, his hou&s;hold bu&s;ine&s;&s;es were not forlet. Thus, from that time forward, more repo&s;e hee had than others who tooke the charge but of one hou&s;e or of one &s;hip. And &s;o having ordered his owne e&s;tate, hee taught tho&s;e al&s;o about him to take the &s;ame cour&s;e. So, by this meanes hee provided for the ea&s;ement both of him&s;elfe, and of tho&s;e al&s;o who belonged neere unto him.</P>
<P>After this hee did &s;et in hand to ordaine, what kinde of per&s;ons they &s;hould be whom he would have to be of his inward companie. Fir&s;t therefore, as many as were able to live of them&s;elves, putting over unto others the tillage and husbanding of their lands, if they gave not attendance at Court, he enqui|red after them: becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e that thus waited would doe nothing that was evill and un&s;eemely: partly for that they were in the Princes pre&s;ence, and in part by rea&s;on they knew them&s;elves to be marked and &s;eene what&s;oe|ver they did of men of the be&s;t note. And for tho&s;e that kept away, he thought they were ab&s;ent, in regard of &s;ome Intemperance, inju&s;tice, or negligence. Be|ing therefore thus per&s;waded of them, he forced them to be pre&s;ent. For, hee gave commaundement to &s;ome one or other of his chiefe favourites, to &s;eize
<PB N="179" REF="100">upon the goods of him who u&s;ually frequented not the Court, and to profe&s;&s;e openly and &s;ay, that he entred upon his owne. This was no &s;ooner put in exe|cution, but immediately, they that were thus de&s;poiled came with complaint as if they had beene wronged. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> did put them off a great while, &s;aying his lea&s;ure would not &s;erve to lend his eare to &s;uch per&s;ons: and even after he had heard their cau&s;e, yet deferred he a long time the debating and deciding of their &s;uites. And in &s;o doing, he &s;uppo&s;ed, that as he taught them to wait and give better attendance: &s;o they would be le&s;&s;e offended with him, than if by cha&s;ti&s;ement he had forced them to wait. This I &s;ay was one meanes to teach them for to attend. Another way he had, and that was thus. Whiles they were in pre&s;ence he enjoyned them very ea&s;ie mini&s;teries, and the &s;ame mo&s;t gainefull to them&s;elves. A third device he practi&s;ed be&s;ides, namely in that he never<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">by way of gift.</NOTE> dealt ought among tho&s;e that were ab&s;ent: but the mo&s;t effectuall meanes was, meere nece&s;&s;ity: that if any one would by none of all the&s;e be brought to it, he would take from &s;uch an one his goods and be&s;tow the &s;ame upon ano|ther whom he thought &s;ufficient and able to be ready at his commaund in all occa&s;ions. Thus got he a profitable friend for an unprofitable. Well, in this manner dealt <HI>Cyrus</HI> with tho&s;e that were ab&s;ent. And even the King who reig|neth at this day, inquireth into &s;uch, as being by their place and office bound to give attendance are away. But looke who pre&s;ented them&s;elves, tho&s;e hee thought he &s;hould excite mo&s;t, unto noble and excellent actions, if as he had &s;overaigne commaund over them, &s;o he endevoured to &s;hew him&s;elfe unto his &s;ubjects mo&s;t of all others adorned with vertues. For, it &s;eemed he con&s;ide|red thus much, that even by po&s;itive and written lawes men are made better. But a good Magi&s;trate he &s;uppo&s;ed to be unto his people a &s;eeing law: as who was able to reduce into order, to note al&s;o and to puni&s;h him that was di&s;order|ly. Being of this mind, fir&s;t and principally above all things, he declared him|&s;elfe at this time more religious and re&s;pective of Gods wor&s;hip, becau&s;e he had &s;ped &s;o happily in his affaires. And then it was fir&s;t ordained that the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Magi.</NOTE> Prie&s;ts &s;hould chaunt hymnes continually by breake of day unto the honor of the Gods, and daily to offer what &s;acrifices unto which Gods them&s;elves pro|nounced. The&s;e ordinances in&s;tituted then, continue &s;till at this day by tradi|tion from King to King &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. And herein e&s;pecially did other <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> imitate him, becau&s;e they were fully per&s;waded, they &s;hould be the happier if they &s;erved the Gods in that manner as he did, who was of all other mo&s;t happy, and their Prince be&s;ide. Againe, in &s;o doing, they thought to be in his favour and to plea&s;e him. <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o him&s;elfe was of opinion that the religious devotion of his &s;ubjects was behoovefull for him; directed herein by the &s;ame rea&s;on that they are, who upon grounded judgement are more willing to goe to &s;ea and to &s;aile in their companie that feare God and be religious, than with tho&s;e that are tainted with irreligion and impiety. Moreover, this accompt made he, that if all tho&s;e that accompanied him were devout, they would be better affected one to another, and more re&s;pective of him, and in no wi&s;e per|petrate any ungodly act again&s;t his per&s;on, who thought him&s;elfe to have de|&s;erved right well of the whole &s;ociety of his favourites and courtiers. Further|more, making it knowne abroad, to e&s;teeme highly of this one thing, that no friend or confederate of his &s;hould be wronged, as one who had an exact in&s;ight in law and preci&s;ely ob&s;erved the &s;ame he thought this would en&s;ue of it, that
<PB N="180" REF="101">others likewi&s;e forbearing filthie lucre, would by ju&s;t and lawfull meanes onely chu&s;e to better their e&s;tates. He &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o they would all be more &s;hame|faced and mode&s;t, in ca&s;e he made open &s;hew, to have that reverent regard of them all, as neither to &s;peake an undecent word nor commit any foule deed. And that this would proceed thereof, he collected by this argument. For, men are wont to give better re&s;pect, I &s;ay not to a Magi&s;trate, but even to tho&s;e of whom they &s;tand not in awe, if they be mode&s;t and ba&s;hfull, than to &s;uch as be &s;hamele&s;&s;e and impudent: yea and perceiving any woman to be mode&s;t and de|mure, they re&s;pect them al&s;o with &s;emblable reverence when they behold them. Likewi&s;e, he thought that tho&s;e about him would per&s;i&s;t con&s;tantly in their al|leageance to him, if he graced and rewarded in the eyes of the world, tho&s;e who without excu&s;e or refu&s;all, obeyed him, than &s;uch as &s;eemed to be endued with the greate&s;t vertues, and &s;uch as could not be acquired without exceeding labour and paines. And as he was of this judgement, &s;o he profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame continually in all his practi&s;e. By &s;hewing al&s;o his owne moderation and tem|perance, he provoked all others the rather to u&s;e the &s;ame. For when as men &s;ee one in his carriage mode&s;t, who hath greate&s;t meanes to warrant his in&s;olency, others who have &s;maller meanes, will not openly be &s;eene to commit any in&s;o|lent parts. And in this wi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed he, betweene ba&s;hfull mode&s;ty and &s;o|ber temperance, &s;aying that ba&s;hfull per&s;ons forbeare wickedne&s;&s;e abroad in the &s;ight of others, but temperate men avoid the &s;ame in &s;ecret corners. As tou|ching continency, he thought his courtiers would be given thereto the more, in ca&s;e he bare him&s;elfe &s;o continent, as not by any plea&s;ures pre&s;ented unto him, to be plucked away from good things, but willing to undertake travailes joyned with hone&s;tie, before all delights what&s;oever. And verily, being thus di&s;po&s;ed in him&s;elfe he effected this, that among tho&s;e in his court, there was much comely order, whiles the inferiour &s;ort gave place unto their &s;uperiours, and yet carried a re&s;pective reverence and decent gravity one unto another. A man &s;hould not have &s;eene one there, either in anger crying out uncivilly, or in mirth laughing exce&s;&s;ively. But who&s;oever had beheld them, would have thought they had lived canonically indeed, to the very rule and &s;quire of ver|tue and decency. Well, thus they partly did, and the&s;e examples they &s;aw who conver&s;ed in Court.</P>

<P>TO come now to martiall exerci&s;es, <HI>Cyrus</HI> u&s;ed to lead tho&s;e forth a hun|ting, whom he thought meet to be inured and trained therein: For that, he tooke hunting to be the be&s;t &s;imply as in generall, of warlike feats; &s;o the true&s;t practi&s;e e&s;pecially of good hor&s;eman&s;hip. For in this regard, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity cha&s;e and follow wild bea&s;ts as they flye; it maketh them mo&s;t fit and expert in riding any ground what&s;oever; it cau&s;eth them al&s;o to be mo&s;t deliver and expedite in performing any &s;ervice on hor&s;ebacke, by rea&s;on of the ambitious and eager de&s;ire they have to take the &s;aid bea&s;ts.

<PB N="181" REF="101">and continency, enabling them to endure travaile, cold, heat, hunger and thir&s;t. And now even at this day, the King him&s;elfe and his traine about him practi&s;e this ordinarily. And that he thought none worthy to beare &s;ove|raigne rule, who was not better than the &s;ubjects whom he ruled, appeareth evidently to every man, as well by that, which heretofore hath beene related, as al&s;o by this, that in exerci&s;ing his Courtiers after this manner, him&s;elfe above them all, by labour, practi&s;ed as well &s;obriety and temperance as military arts and warlike feats: For as he trained others forth a hunting, when time &s;erved, and no nece&s;&s;ity compelled him to &s;tay at home, &s;o him&s;elfe al&s;o upon urgent occa&s;ions detaining him, hunted wild bea&s;ts kept of purpo&s;e in parks about home. And then, would neither he him&s;elfe take any &s;upper before he had &s;wet, nor give his hor&s;es provender before they were well exerci&s;ed and ridden. To this hunting, his manner was to call <HI>the Scepter-bearers</HI> of his Court. By rea&s;on therefore of this continuall exerci&s;e, him&s;elfe excelled in worthy deeds: they al&s;o who accompanied him &s;urmounted as much: And verily &s;uch a precedent and example he &s;hewed him&s;elfe unto others. Moreover whom he &s;aw of all the re&s;t mo&s;t earne&s;t followers of good and hone&s;t actions, tho&s;e adorned hee with gifts, with places of government, with preeminence of higher rowmes, and with all manner of honours. Whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e, that he kindled in them all, an ardent de&s;ire and emulation, whiles every one &s;trived to be thought of <HI>Cyrus</HI> mo&s;t excellent. Furthermore thus much al&s;o to our thinking have we ob&s;erved in <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that not herein onely he thought magi&s;trates &s;hould &s;urpa&s;&s;e their &s;ubjects, namely, to be better than they, but to charme al&s;o and enchaunt them, as it were, otherwi&s;e, after a cunning &s;ort. And therefore made he choice him&s;elfe to goe in a &s;ide and loo&s;e <HI>Median</HI> robe, and per&s;waded al&s;o his Cour|tiers and Favourites to weare the like. For, <HI>Cyrus</HI> thought, that if any defect were in the bodie, this manner of ve&s;ture would hide the &s;ame: and be&s;ides make them that were arrayed therewith, to carry a right goodly pre&s;ence with them, and to &s;eeme mo&s;t per&s;onable. For the <HI>Medes</HI> u&s;e under this habit, &s;uch a kind of &s;hooes, as they might underlay clo&s;ely and out of &s;ight, thereby to ap|peare taller than they are. He permitted them likewi&s;e to u&s;e painting under their eyes, to the end they might be thought to have more beautifull eyes than they had: al&s;o to rub colours into their skins, to &s;eeme of better complexion than they were by nature. Be&s;ides, hee inured them to this, neither to &s;pit nor &s;nit openly in &s;ight, nor to turne their bodies to the a&s;pect of any &s;hew, as men that admired nothing, nor regarded nouelties. And all the&s;e things hee &s;uppo|&s;ed to make &s;omewhat for this, that they might bee le&s;&s;e contemptible to tho&s;e vnder them. And verily after this manner framed hee tho&s;e whom hee meant &s;hould ri&s;e by him, and become deputies under him, both in their exerci&s;es, and al&s;o in carrying a port and maje&s;ty over them. But &s;uch as hee ordained for to &s;erve, hee neither &s;tirred up to ingenuous labours, nor permitted once to beare armes. Howbeit, hee provided for them &s;o, as they never went with|out meate or drinke competent, for the attending of any liberall exerci&s;es. For, tho&s;e &s;ervants, &s;o often as they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or rowze.</NOTE> did put up any wilde bea&s;ts, and drave them into places for the hor&s;e-means game, hee &s;uffered to take victuals with them into the Forre&s;t where they hunted, but none of free condition allowed hee &s;o to doe. Al&s;o when hee was to make any iourney, hee led them to the waters like as labouring bea&s;ts. Now, when dinner time was, hee would &s;tay with
<PB N="182" REF="102">them untill they had eaten &s;omewhat, to the end they &s;hould not faint for hun|ger. And by this u&s;age, he wrought &s;o with them, that even the&s;e al&s;o, as well as the nobles and men of be&s;t marke called <HI>Cyrus</HI> Father, as taking &s;uch care for them, to the end that without making any que&s;tion, they might alwaies beare the yoke of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>Thus e&s;tabli&s;hed he the whole <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire in great &s;afety, and was fully confident, that toward him&s;elfe from the nations which he had &s;ubdued, there was no daunger at all. For, he reputed them feeble and weake, he &s;aw them un|furni&s;hed and without good order: and withall, there was not one of them that either by night or day approached neere unto his per&s;on. As for tho&s;e whom he tooke to be the brave&s;t and hardie&s;t men and &s;aw armed in troupes, and knew &s;ome to be leaders of hor&s;emen and others of footmen: Many al&s;o of them whom hee perceived to carry an hauty mind (as who were &s;ufficient to com|maund) and to draw neerer than the re&s;t to his guard and to the &s;quires of his body, for many of the&s;e oftentimes had entercour&s;e with <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe (a thing that of nece&s;&s;ity could not be avoided, becau&s;e hee meant to make u&s;e of their employment.) From the&s;e I &s;ay, there was &s;ome doubt and daunger of harme to grow unto his per&s;on, and that many and &s;undry waies. Wherefore when he devi&s;ed with him&s;elfe by what meanes he might be &s;ecured from them: to di&s;arme them that thereby they might be di&s;abled for the warres, he would not allow: as &s;uppo&s;ing that to be meere inju&s;tice, and deeming it to threaten the &s;ubver&s;ion of his owne Empire: Againe, not to admit them to his pre|&s;ence, and openly to &s;hew that he di&s;tru&s;ted them, he thought was the next way to &s;tirre coles and kindle rebellion. This one device for all the&s;e he deemed both to &s;erve be&s;t for his owne &s;ecurity, and to &s;tand mo&s;t with his honour: to wit, if po&s;&s;ibly he could bring tho&s;e of be&s;t worth, to be more friendly affected to him&s;elfe than they were one to another. And therefore by what meanes as we thinke, he attained thereunto, namely to win their love, we will endeavour to de|clare. Fir&s;t and formo&s;t, at all times he &s;hewed unto them e&s;pecially, as much as he could, humanity and kindne&s;&s;e of heart, &s;uppo&s;ing this with him&s;elfe, that as it is no ea&s;ie matter to love tho&s;e which &s;eem to hate us, nor to will well to them, that are ill minded unto us: &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible, that they who&s;e love and good will is once knowne, &s;hould be odious unto tho&s;e who thought they were belo|ved of them. Wherefore &s;o long as he was not &s;o well &s;tored with money, nor had wherewith to be liberall: by provident care over them whom he kept about him, as al&s;o by his forwardne&s;&s;e in paines taking before them: by open declaring that he rejoyced at their well doings, and grieved at their misfortunes, he endea|voured to win their hearts and gaine their friend&s;hip. But after he had gotten &s;o much aforehand, as that he was able by bountifull giving to be beneficiall, he judged as we &s;uppo&s;e, fir&s;t and principally that men e&s;teemed no benefits of the &s;ame co&s;t and value more welcome and acceptable, than the participation of meats and drinks. Being I &s;ay of this opinion, he tooke up this order fir&s;t, at his owne table, that what meats him&s;elfe u&s;ed to feed upon, the like thereto &s;hould alwaies be &s;erved up unto him: but &s;ufficient to content and &s;atisfie many men be&s;ides. And looke, what viands &s;oever were &s;et upon the bourd, he ever dealt among his favourites whom he thought well of, all the &s;ame, &s;ave onely &s;uch di&s;hes as him&s;elfe and tho&s;e who &s;at with him at the table fed upon: thereby to &s;hew that he was mindfull of them, or el&s;e to te&s;tifie his bounteous mind. More|over,
<PB N="183" REF="102">he was wont to &s;end meats unto them, who&s;e diligent &s;ervice either in kee|ping watch and ward, or in ob&s;equious attendance, or in &s;ome other actions, he highly admired: thereby to declare, that he would have them know, how wil|ling he was to gratifie them. And even his very hou&s;hold &s;ervitours he would honour and grace, by &s;ending them di&s;hes from his owne table, when&s;oever he had commended any of them. Yea and all the cates for his &s;aid &s;ervants, hee would have to &s;tand upon his owne bourd, thinking that even this al&s;o would win their hearts, and gaine a certaine love from them, like as we &s;ee it u&s;ually doth in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or dogs. <GAP DESC="foreign">. i. children.</NOTE> hounds. And if he were de&s;irous that and of his friends &s;hould be e&s;tee|med and loved of many more be&s;ides, even to them al&s;o would he &s;end &s;ome|what from his owne bourd. In &s;o much, as at this very day, unto whom men &s;ee any viands &s;ent from the Kings table, they all count them &s;o much the more, as whom they repute to be honourable per&s;ons and able enough to doe them good and to &s;peed their &s;uits if need required. And not onely in the&s;e re&s;pects afore&s;aid, whatever is &s;ent from a King is acceptable and delight&s;ome, but al&s;o in very deed, tho&s;e meats which come from a Kings table, be exceeding &s;weet and delicate. And no mervaile they &s;hould be &s;o: For like as all other arts be in great cities mo&s;t perfect and exqui&s;ite, even &s;o Kings meats are above other ve|ry curiou&s;ly and finely handled. For, in &s;mall townes it falleth out, that one and the &s;ame man maketh a bed&s;ted, a doore, a plough and a table (yea and many a time beleeve me, the &s;ame party al&s;o buildeth an hou&s;e, and is well appayed if by this meanes he can meet with any to &s;et him aworke, whereby he may find a competent living. And verily it cannot be, that he who practi&s;eth many arts &s;hould performe them all very well and excellently.) Whereas in great and po|pulous cities, becau&s;e many men have need of one and the &s;ame thing, one &s;eve|rall &s;cience is &s;ufficient for each man to maintaine and keep him. And many a time, le&s;&s;e than one whole and entier my&s;tery will doe it: For yee &s;hall have one man make &s;hooes for men: another for women. Yea and that which is more, one man findeth a good living by &s;owing &s;hooes onely, whiles another liveth by bare cutting them out. In like manner you &s;hall &s;ee one, that cutteth out and &s;ha|peth garments, and doth nought el&s;e: another practi&s;eth none of all that, but &s;et|teth and &s;oweth the peeces together. And therefore it mu&s;t needs be, that he who is occupied in the &s;horte&s;t peece of worke, is able to doe that pa&s;&s;ing well. The &s;elfe-&s;ame thing is to be &s;eene in our diet and hou&s;e-keeping. For, who&s;oever he is that hath one and the &s;ame man to make his bed, to cover the bourd, to mould loaves and to make bread, to dre&s;&s;e now this di&s;h of meat, then that, he mu&s;t in my conceit have every thing done but &s;o &s;o, and as it hapneth. But when one man hath enough to doe to boyle, another to ro&s;t fle&s;h, one to &s;eethe fi&s;hes, ano|ther to fry or broyle them, and another to make loaves of bread and tho&s;e not moulded after divers fa&s;hions, but &s;erve the turne it will if in &s;ome one kind the &s;ame be pa&s;&s;ing well and perfitly done, it cannot then otherwi&s;e be, but that the&s;e things in this wi&s;e made, &s;hould every one be excellently wrought: and &s;o by con&s;equence, the fare in Court &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all other. Well, after this manner in winning the hearts of tho&s;e about him, he went farre beyond all other Princes.</P>
<P>But how in all things el&s;e he excelled, for making much of them, I will now declare. For, albeit he outwent all other Potentates in this, that hee received mo&s;t revenues, yet he &s;urmounted them much more in liberall gifts. And this munificence began in <HI>Cyrus</HI> fir&s;t, and hath continued ever &s;ince to this pre&s;ent
<PB N="184" REF="103">day, with all the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> For, who is he that hath richer friends and fa|vorites openly knowne, than the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King! What Prince is &s;eene to array his followers in more gorgeous and &s;umptuous robes than this King? Who&s;e gifts are knowne to be &s;uch, as &s;ome of this Kings are? to wit, bracelets, collars and cheines, hor&s;es al&s;o with bridles and trappings of gold? For, in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> none may have the&s;e but of the Kings gift. Who but he, hath the name by his large gifts to bring this to pa&s;&s;e, that he is preferred in love before brethren, parents and children? who be&s;ides him was able &s;o to be revenged of his enemies, di&s;tant though they were from him many moneths journey, as the King of <HI>Per&s;ia?</HI> who againe, but <HI>Cyrus</HI> having conquered a mighty Monarchie, ended his life &s;o, as at his dying day he could get the name of a father among all his &s;ubjects? and evi|dent it is, that this name is attributed unto him rather who giveth benefits, than to one that taketh ought away. Moreover we have heard it reported, that &s;uch as are called the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Intelligen|cers.</NOTE> Eyes and Eares of Kings, he procured to him&s;elfe by no other meanes but by large&s;&s;e and giving great rewards. For, when he highly fed with gifts tho&s;e who brought him intelligence of all &s;uch occurrents, as were meet for him to know, he effected thus much, that very many men both &s;pied and li&s;tened after &s;omewhat, to bring the &s;ame to the Kings eares, whereby &s;ome commodity might accrue unto him. Hereupon it came, that a King was thought to have many eyes and as many eares. Now, if any man think that a King ought to have one to be his e&s;peciall eye and no more, he taketh not the thing aright. For, one man is able to &s;ee or heare but a little. And if that one have this com|mi&s;&s;ion all the re&s;t may &s;eeme to be enjoyned negligence. Be&s;ides, whom&s;oever they perceived once to be that eye of the King, him they might know well enough they ought to beware of. But the ca&s;e is nothing &s;o: For, the King gives eare to every one, that &s;aith he hath either heard or &s;eene ought, worth regard. Thus, there are thought to be many eyes and eares of a King: and in every place men are affraid to let fall any words that are not for his behou&s;e, as if he heard all, and likewi&s;e to do any thing, again&s;t his good e&s;tate and dignity as if him|&s;elfe were in per&s;on pre&s;ent to &s;ee all. And &s;o farre off, was any man from da|ring to give out any reproachfull &s;peeches again&s;t <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that every one demea|ned him&s;elfe &s;o, as if all that were in place conver&s;ed continually in the eyes and eares of the King. Now, that mens hearts were thus knit unto <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I know no better rea&s;on that men can alleadge than this, that for &s;mall kindne&s;&s;es he was willing ever to give great gifts. And no mervaile that he excelled thus in boun|tifull giving, being as he was exceeding rich. But this rather de&s;erveth to be &s;poken of, that albeit he was in regall e&s;tate and dignity, yet he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, for courte&s;ies and favours to his friends and dependants. Certes reported it is of him, that in no one thing was he &s;o much aba&s;hed to be overcome as in kind of|fices to his friends. And to this purpo&s;e, reported there is this Apophthegme of his: For he was wont to &s;ay, that the parts required in a good heardman and a good King were &s;emblable. And as it was the duty of a pa&s;tour, after he hath made the bea&s;ts under his hand in good plight and happy, (For that verily is the felicity of cattaile) then to u&s;e them: even &s;o a King ought to make u&s;e of tho&s;e Cities and that people which him&s;elfe before had made fortunate.</P>

<P>NO wonder it was therefore, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> being him&s;elfe of this minde, labored e&s;pecially to outgoe all other men ingentlene&s;&s;e &amp; humanitie; And hereof it is reported, that he gave a &s;ingular proofe unto <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> what time as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That is, <HI>Croe|&s;us.</HI></NOTE> he admoni&s;hed him and &s;aid, That giving away &s;o much as he did, he would him&s;elfe become a begger in the end. Whereas, quoth he, you are the onely man that might have laid up exceeding much trea&s;ure of gold in your coffers, if you had li&s;t. For, then <HI>Cyrus</HI> by report asked him &s;aying, And how much money thinke you might I have had by this time, if according to your rede, I had bin a hoarder of gold, from the fir&s;t time that I came to mine Empire? <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> an&s;wered and named a certaine great &s;umme. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Goe to then <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> quoth he, &s;end with <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> here, &s;ome one whom you of all other tru&s;t be&s;t. And as for you <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> Goe among my friends from one to another; and &s;ay, in my name, that for &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of mine owne, I am at a fault for gold (and in very truth great occa&s;ions I have of money) will them to let me have what they can every one make. And withall when they have &s;et downe the &s;everall &s;ummes and &s;ealed them up, to give the note of particulars with a letter to <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> his &s;ervitour, for to bring backe with him. When hee had written al&s;o what&s;oever he had &s;poken, and &s;igned his letters, he gave them to <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> to carry unto his &s;aid friends, with this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Po&s;t|&s;cript.</NOTE> Addition unto them all, That they &s;hould entertaine <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> al&s;o the bearer, as his friend and favorite. Now when hee had gone round about them all, and <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> his mini&s;ter brought the letters afore&s;aid: then <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> You are to make u&s;e of mee al&s;o, quoth he, &ocirc; King <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as of a wealthy man. For, loe, here am I enriched of a &s;udden with many gifts in regard of your letters. Whereupon <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Here is, &ocirc; <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> our Trea&s;ure that we have gotten already: Con&s;ider the re&s;t by him, and reckon what great &s;ummes of money I am provided of, in ca&s;e I &s;tand in need of them for any purpo&s;e. <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> when he had ca&s;t the accompt, found, as they &s;ay, that it amounted to much more than hee &s;aid <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;hould have found in his Exchequer, if hee had beene a gatherer and laid up continually. When this appeared thus, See you not, &ocirc; <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that I al&s;o am &s;tored with trea&s;ure? But you would have mee by heaping up altogither at home, for to lye open unto envie and hatred abroad, by the meanes thereof: yea, and to &s;et hirelings and tru&s;t them with the keeping of the &s;ame. But I accompt my friends by mee enriched to bee my trea&s;uries, and the keepers both of my per&s;on, and al&s;o of my goods more &s;ure and faithfull, than if I &s;hould wage garri&s;on-&s;ouldiers, and tru&s;t them with the cu&s;todie thereof. An|other thing al&s;o will I &s;ay unto you. That which the Gods have put into mens minds, and thereby made them all indigent and poore alike; the &s;ame affection verily, I my &s;elfe am not able to conquer and &s;ubdue. For, I cannot have my fill of money no more than all others. But, in this point mee thinkes, I goe be|yond mo&s;t of them: in that when they have gotten togither more than will &s;uffice their turnes, part thereof they bury in the ground, part they &s;uffer to rot
<PB N="186" REF="104">and be marred: And what with telling, mea&s;uring, weighing, winnowing, ay|ring, and keeping, they have much adoe withall. And yet for all this, whiles they have all at home, they neither eate more than they can beare (for then would they bur&s;t) nor put on more clothes, than they can carry, for &s;o they &s;hould be &s;weltered and &s;tifled: but their &s;uperfluous money and riches troubles and tor|ments them not a little. As for mee, I &s;erve and honour the Gods with my goods, and ever covet to have more &s;till. And when I have gotten it: looke what &s;urplu&s;age I &s;ee over and above &s;uffi&s;ance, therewith I &s;upply the penury and want of my friends. By enriching men, and be&s;towing benefits liberally upon them I winne good will and amitie: The fruit whereof I reape, to wit, &s;ecuritie and glory. And &s;uch fruits as the&s;e, neither fade and peri&s;h, nor by growing over-ranke corrupt any man: but glory and good name the more it is, the greater and fairer it groweth &s;till: the more portable it is, and oftentimes cau&s;eth them to be the lighter that beare it. And for your further knowledge, &ocirc; <HI>Crae&s;us,</HI> take this al&s;o with you, quoth he. I e&s;teeme not tho&s;e the happie&s;t men, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e mo&s;t and have greate&s;t &s;tore in their cu&s;todie (for by this rea&s;on the Warders of towne walls &s;hould be mo&s;t fortunate, For, the keeping they have of all within the &s;aid townes) but who can get mo&s;t goods ju&s;tly and u&s;e the &s;ame well and hone&s;tly, him I repute mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed, and his money and wealth al&s;o. And as <HI>Cyrus</HI> delivered thus much in word, &s;o he was knowne to performe it in deed.</P>
<P>Furthermore perceiving mo&s;t men to endevour, if they were in good health, to be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries, and to lay up in &s;tore &s;uch things as &s;erved for the dyet of healthfull per&s;ons: &s;eeing withall, that they tooke no great care, to have in readine&s;&s;e meanes requi&s;ite, if they &s;hould fall &s;icke: he thought it good to be provided al&s;o in this behalfe. Whereupon he entertained about him the mo&s;t skilfull Phy&s;icians that were to be had. And looke what meanes and in|&s;truments any man put into his head to be good and expedient for him: were they in the nature of [purging] medicines, or meats, or drinks, there was not any of them, but he would be &s;tored therewith, and have ready in his Cabinets. And if at any time, one of them whom it skilled mo&s;t to be cured, fell &s;icke, him would hee vi&s;it, and mini&s;ter unto him what&s;oever was needfull. Yea, thankfull he was unto the Phy&s;icians, if one had healed any of them, although he had taken and u&s;ed in the cure &s;ome drugges which him&s;elfe had laid up for his owne &s;tore. The&s;e meanes and many other &s;uch he practi&s;ed, for to be in chiefe e&s;teeme with them, of whom he de&s;ired to be loved.</P>
<P>Moreover, of what things he publi&s;hed &s;olemne games and propo&s;ed pri&s;es, minding thereby to kindle and &s;tirre up in mens minds a &s;trife, about brave and worthy feats, the &s;ame wanne <HI>Cyrus</HI> prai&s;e and commendation: becau&s;e his care was, that prowe&s;&s;e &s;hould bee practi&s;ed. And verily, the&s;e games and exer|ci&s;es bred and imprinted in the be&s;t &s;ort contentions and emulations one with another.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Cyrus</HI> ordained in manner of a law, that what&s;oever was to be decided either by way of Civill Action or by tryall in Combat, they whom it concerned to have their cau&s;es determined, &s;hould have recour&s;e togither un|to the Iudges. And thus it is evident that the adver&s;aries of both &s;ides had an eye unto &s;uch Iudges, as were &s;imply be&s;t, and their greate&s;t friends.

Semblably, they who &s;ought to be in mo&s;t favour with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> bare envie one to another, like as it fareth with others that live in Cities. And therefore the mo&s;t part wi&s;hed one another rid out of the world, rather than procured the mutuall good either of other.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> The triumphant pompe of King <HI>Cyrus</HI> riding forth of his Palace. A &s;olemne hor&s;e-running wherein him&s;elfe was winner.</HEAD>
<P>AND now declare we will in what manner <HI>Cyrus</HI> the fir&s;t time came a|broad riding forth of his Royall Palace. For, the maje&s;tie of this &s;et|ting out of his, &s;eemeth unto me one of tho&s;e arts and cunning ca&s;ts, which made his Imperiall State not to bee contemned. Fir&s;t, therefore, ere he went forth on hor&s;ebacke, hee called togither unto him tho&s;e that were in any place of government under him, as well Per&s;ians as others: and dealt about unto them <HI>Median</HI> &s;ide-robes, (and this verily was the fir&s;t time, that ever the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> ware this <HI>Median</HI> habit) and in this di&s;tribution, he &s;aid withall unto them, that he was minded to ride unto the &s;acred groves e&s;pecially &s;elected for the Gods, and togither with them, there to &s;acrifice. Be ready therefore, &s;aith he, betimes at the Court gates, clad in the&s;e robes before the Sunne ri&s;e, and &s;tand yee in &s;uch ray, as <HI>Pheraulas</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;hall appoint by order and dire|ction from mee. And when I am gone before, follow yee after, every man in the &s;ame ranke and place wherein he &s;tandeth. And if any of you can thinke of a better and comelier way for us to ride forth than this is: let him acquaint us therewith, when we &s;hall returne backe againe. For, as yee &s;hall thinke it mo&s;t &s;eemely and be&s;t, &s;o, &s;hall every thing be di&s;po&s;ed re&s;pectively. After he had be&s;towed upon the worthie&s;t per&s;ons the faire&s;t robes, hee brought forth other <HI>Median</HI> garments likewi&s;e of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, (for provided he had many ve&s;tures of divers and &s;undry &s;orts, making no &s;pare either of purple and &s;carlet, blacke and puke, or of red, or of &s;anguine colour. And having gi|ven &s;ome of the&s;e to every Captaine: Decke herewith, I bid you, quoth he, your friends, like as I doe you. Then one of them who were pre&s;ent &s;aid, And when will you good <HI>Cyrus</HI> be dight your &s;elfe? Vnto whom hee made this an|&s;were, Why! Doe not you thinke me now adorned, when I thus dre&s;&s;e and trim you. Certes, quoth he, were I able to doe you good that are my friends, what robe &s;oever I wore, therein &s;hould I &s;eeme fine and gorgeous enough. Thus when they were departed, they &s;ent for their friends, and clad them rich|ly in tho&s;e robes. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> for that hee &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> (by his degree a Commoner) to bee a wi&s;e under&s;tanding man and be&s;ide hand&s;ome and feat, and withall very formall, and one that would let &s;lip no occa&s;ion to gratifie him: and who before-time had approoved that Decree, of honouring every man according to his worth, him he calleth for, and devi&s;eth with him, how
<PB N="188" REF="105">he might make this progre&s;&s;e of his, mo&s;t acceptable to his affectionate friends, and as terrible to his enemies. Now when they both had con&s;idered well here|upon, and were accorded in one and the &s;ame point, hee gave <HI>Pheraulas</HI> in charge, that this riding forth the next day might be ordered &s;o, as they thought it mo&s;t decent and commendable: For mine owne part, quoth he, I have given warning already, that they be all obedient to you, in the mar&s;halling of this &s;aid &s;olemnitie, but to the end they may more willingly be ruled by you, here, take the&s;e coats to di&s;tribute among the Captaines of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Pen&s;io|ners.</NOTE> Guard: The&s;e &s;ad|dle clothes be&s;ides (of tape&s;try) be&s;tow upon the Leaders of the hor&s;emen, and the&s;e other liveries give unto the Rulers of the Chariots. So <HI>Pheraulas</HI> re|ceived this furniture and carried it accordingly. Whom when the Captaines and Rulers afore&s;aid &s;aw, You are become &s;ay they, &ocirc; <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> &s;ome great man now, in that you are to direct us al&s;o in tho&s;e things that are to bee done. Not &s;o, quoth <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> as God love mee. So farre am I from being &s;uch an one as you take mee: that I am ready even to be a Porter al&s;o, to carry bag and baggage among you. For, &s;ee how I bring here with me, the&s;e two &s;hag clothes of tape&s;try, the one for you, and the other for him there: but take you the choi&s;e of them: whereupon the partie that was about to receive the &s;aid &s;addle cloth, forgetting all envie, pre&s;ently asked his advice, whether of them he &s;hould take. And when <HI>Pheraulas</HI> gave him coun&s;ell to lay hold of that which hee tooke to be the better: If you will blame mee, quoth hee, for giving you the choi&s;e, hereafter when I &s;hall execute my function, you &s;hall finde mee ano|ther kinde of mini&s;ter, and unlike to my &s;elfe now. Thus <HI>Pheraulas</HI> having made this di&s;tribution as he was commaunded, tooke order for all things that belon|ged to the &s;olemne riding forth and pompe of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that every thing might be mo&s;t hand&s;omely and featly performed. When the morrow was come, all was made cleane and neat, before day-light. And they &s;tood by ranke and file directly in order on both &s;ides of the way: like as at this day they u&s;e to take their &s;tanding what way the King is to ride forth any wither: neither is it law|full for any to enter within the&s;e &s;aid ranks, unle&s;&s;e they were eminent and honourable per&s;ons. There were al&s;o certaine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As Tip&s;taves.</NOTE> Officers that &s;tood with whips, to beat tho&s;e that made any mi&s;-rule. Fir&s;t and formo&s;t, pre&s;ented them&s;elves tho&s;e Pen&s;ioners of the guard to the number of 4000.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> with launces, foure in ranke before the Court gates, and on either &s;ide of the gates 2000. All the men of Armes likewi&s;e were pre&s;ent to &s;hew them&s;elves, being alighted from their hor&s;es, carrying their armes out of their &s;leevele&s;&s;e ca&s;&s;ocks, as the manner is in the&s;e dayes to put them forth when&s;oever the King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">When they mu&s;ter before him.</NOTE> view|eth them. Semblably, on the right hand &s;tood the Per&s;ians, and the re&s;t that were A&s;&s;ociates, on the left hand of the way. After which manner were the Chariots placed, halfe on the one&s;ide, and halfe on the other. Now when the Court gates were &s;et open, Fir&s;t, were led forth goodly faire Buls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In ranke.</NOTE> foure by foure for Iupiter, as al&s;o for other Gods, as the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Magi.</NOTE> Prie&s;ts gave direction. For, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are of this opinion, that in the &s;ervice of the Gods, there are to be employed skilfull Arti&s;ts, much more than in any other occa&s;ions. After the&s;e Buls, were Hor&s;es led out for &s;acrifice to the Sun: and after them was brought forth a white Chariot, with a golden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Cro&s;|bred.</NOTE> Spring-tree, and the &s;ame adorned with Coronets (and &s;acred this was unto Iupiter.) Behind which came the white Chariot of the Sunne, &s;et likewi&s;e with Crownes as the other before. After it
<PB N="189" REF="105">was led forth, a third Chariot and the Steeds drawing it, all trapped and cove|red with red Capari&s;ons: and behind it, certaine men followed, who upon a great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Hearth. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> pan carryed fire. After all the&s;e rode <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe out of the gates, all goodly to be &s;eene, in a Chariot, with an upright turbant upon his head, clad in a purple ca&s;&s;ocke halfe white (for none el&s;e may weare a garment halfe white) and having about his thighs and legs, breeches and &s;tockings of &s;carlet dye, but his coat of Armes, was all purple throughout. About his turbant afore|&s;aid, he had<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Regall band.</NOTE> a Diadem, the very badge and cogni&s;ance, that all his kin&s;men likewi&s;e be knowne by, and even at this day they retaine the &s;ame En&s;igne. His hands likewi&s;e he did put forth out of his &s;leeves. There guided his Chariot mounted hard by him, his Chariotier, a bigge man of &s;tature, yet nothing &s;o per&s;onable as him&s;elfe: whether it were &s;o in very deed, or by &s;ome other meanes, I wote not: but however, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;eemed a much taller and goodlier per|&s;on. When they beheld him as he pa&s;&s;ed along, they all adored him; either for that &s;ome had a commandement to begin this manner of adoration, or becau&s;e they were ravi&s;hed and amazed with the &s;ight of &s;o rich and &s;tately aray: or el&s;e for that <HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe &s;eemed to carry &s;uch a maje&s;tie and beautie in his per&s;onage. True it is, that before this time, never any <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> had thus wor|&s;hipped <HI>Cyrus.</HI> After that <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Chariot was gone forth, tho&s;e foure thou|&s;and Pen&s;ioners marched before, and two thou&s;and on either &s;ide of the Cha|riot accompanied him. Then, hard after followed his Scepter-bearers on hor&s;e|backe bravely accoutred with their Iavelins, to the number of three hundred. Moreover, led forth there were about two hundred lere-hor&s;es richly to bee &s;eene with golden bridles, which were kept for <HI>Cyrus</HI> his &s;addle, and tho&s;e co|vered with &s;treaked and party-coloured clothes. After the&s;e marched two thou&s;and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Pikemen.</NOTE> launces: and then the Cavallery fir&s;t erected, ten thou&s;and in num|ber, arraunged throughout by hundreds, who had <HI>Chry&s;atas</HI> for their Leader. Next after followed another Regiment of ten thou&s;and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> hor&s;emen in like manner appointed, who&s;e Commaunder was <HI>Datamas:</HI> And in the tayle of them, another troupe likewi&s;e conducted by <HI>Gadatas.</HI> Behinde them the <HI>Median</HI> Cavallery, next unto them the <HI>Armenians:</HI> after whom the <HI>Hyrcani|ans,</HI> then the <HI>Cadu&s;ians,</HI> and after the <HI>Cadu&s;ians,</HI> the <HI>Sacans</HI> [hor&s;emen all.] Now behind the Cavallery thus mar&s;halled, there followed the Chariots, foure in ranke, under the conduct of <HI>Artabates</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> When <HI>Cyrus</HI> was now upon the way riding in this pompe, very many there were that followed extraordi|narily without the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Guiders.</NOTE> Colours, preferring &s;undry petitions unto him. To them therefore he &s;ent certaine of his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Scepter-bearers, or S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ave-bearers. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Mace-bearers (for three there were on either &s;ide of his Chariot that accompanied him of purpo&s;e to informe and carry me&s;&s;ages betweene) to declare unto them in his name, that who&s;oever had any reque&s;t to exhibit unto him, he &s;hould deliver his mind unto &s;uch Delegates; as were deputed therefore under him. For they, quoth he, will acquaint me there|with. Whereupon, they went away, and immediatly turned to the men of armes, con&s;ulting to whom each one &s;hould repaire? But <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when hee was di&s;po&s;ed to have any of his favorites mo&s;t honoured of the people, would by a me&s;&s;enger &s;end for them &s;everally by them&s;elves to come unto him, and thus &s;ay: When&s;oever any of the&s;e here, that accompany me in my traine, informe you of ought: if the matter that hee mooveth be frivolous, give no eare nor take heed of his words: but looke who &s;eemes to preferre a ju&s;t &s;upplication,
<PB N="190" REF="106">make me acquainted therewith, that upon deliberation in common togither, we may di&s;patch &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;&s;es with expedition. And verily, all the re&s;t, when&s;oever <HI>Cyrus</HI> called them, obeyed, and with all their might &amp; maine came riding unto him: partly to amplifie all they could, the Soveraine Maje&s;tie of his Empire, and in part to &s;hew their owne double diligence and obedience. But one <HI>Darpharnes</HI> there was rude and ill bred above the re&s;t; who had this conceit in his head, that if hee were not &s;o forward in comming at his call, hee &s;hould be reputed a jollier fellow and more free than others. Which when <HI>Cyrus</HI> perceived, before he was come upon a time and had communed with him, he &s;ent under hand one of tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Scepter-bearers, or, Stave-bearers.</NOTE> Macebearers with a countermaund, willing him to &s;ay unto the man, that now he had no more employment for him. And from that time forward never &s;ent he for him againe. But when a companion of his, that was called for next after him, made his appearance unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> be|fore him: <HI>Cyrus</HI> rode out him&s;elfe to meet him, and of tho&s;e lere-hor&s;es that went by, be&s;towed one upon him, commanding withall one of tho&s;e Mace-bearers, to lead him forth for him, whither he would him&s;elfe. Which as ma|ny as &s;aw, tooke it to be &s;ome great grace and honourable favour. Whereupon ever after many more men did him ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P>Thus when they were come to the &s;acred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Shrines.</NOTE> groves above&s;aid, they &s;acrifi|ced unto Iupiter, with Holocau&s;ts, that is, burnt offrings of whole entire Buls. Semblably unto the Sunne, burning Hor&s;es all whole in like &s;ort. After this, they killed other bea&s;ts for &s;acrifice to the Earth, doing as they had direction from their Prie&s;ts the Magi. Afterwards, to the tutelar Gods of Syria they did likewi&s;e. Which complements being performed, becau&s;e the plot of ground was even and faire, hee erected a goale at the end of a race to the length of five &s;tadia. Wherein hee commanded, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Nation by nation.</NOTE> tribe by tribe, they &s;hould put out their Hor&s;es to runne their be&s;t, for the Prize. Him&s;elfe with the Per&s;ians ran a cour&s;e and wonne. For why! he was mo&s;t expert in Hor&s;eman&s;hip. Of the Medes, <HI>Artabates</HI> gate the victory; for, <HI>Cyrus</HI> had given him an Hor&s;e (of &s;peede.) Among the Syrians, he that was their Captaine. Of the Armenians, <HI>Tigranes.</HI> Among the Hyrcanians, the Colonels &s;onne who had the leading of their Hor&s;emen. Of the Sacans a private &s;ouldier, and he with his Cour&s;et gained ground, and out-rid the other Hor&s;es well-neere halfe the race length. Hereupon <HI>Cyrus</HI> asked the young man, whether he would exchange his Hor&s;e for a kingdome? Who an&s;wered, I would not willingly take a kingdome for him. Yet I would not &s;ticke to make a friend with him, and be&s;tow him upon &s;ome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, worthy.</NOTE> good man. Why then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> I will &s;hew you, where if you winke with both eyes, and doe but<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A clot, or &s;tone.</NOTE> fling from you: you &s;hall not mi&s;&s;e but hit a good man. Doe then but &s;hew me, quoth the Sacan, where they be, that when I have taken up this clot, I may throw among them. With that, <HI>Cyrus</HI> pointed where there were a great &s;ort of his friends and favourites. Then the young man &s;hutting both his eyes clo&s;e, threw the clot from him, and it light upon <HI>Peraulas,</HI> as he rode by: For, it chanced even then, that he was to declare &s;ome errand that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had given him. When he was &s;trucken, hee never turned for the matter, but rode on &s;till to doe that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e which hee was enjoyned. Then the Sacan opened his eyes, and asked whom he had hit? Not one, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;o helpe me Iupiter, of all tho&s;e who are here pre&s;ent. Why then, I am &s;ure, quoth the young man, much le&s;&s;e any one of tho&s;e that bee ab&s;ent. Yes
<PB N="191" REF="106">verily, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you have hit him yonder that rideth pricking &s;o fa&s;t, by the Chariots. How is it then, quoth the other, that he turneth not againe? No doubt, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> he is &s;ome franticke fellow, and not well in his wits, as it &s;hould &s;eeme. Which when this young man heard, hee went &s;treight to &s;ee who he was, and found him to be <HI>Pheraulas:</HI> who&s;e beard was all agore blood, and fouly berayed with earth be&s;ides: For, his no&s;e bled with the blow. Be|ing come unto him, he asked whether he had beene &s;mitten, with that which he flung? Even as you &s;ee, an&s;wered the other, how thinke you of it? Why then, quoth he, I be&s;tow upon you, this faire Cour&s;er under mee: Take him I pray you for my &s;ake. And why &s;o, quoth <HI>Pheraulas?</HI> then, the Sacan related unto him the whole matter, and &s;aid in the end, I have not mi&s;&s;ed I trow, but met with a good and worthy man. Then <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> you &s;hould have given him to a richer man if you had done wi&s;ely. Howbeit I accept your gift: and I be&s;eech the Gods (who&s;e will it was, that you &s;hould light on mee) to give me grace &s;o to carry my &s;elfe as that you may never repent of this your gift be|&s;towed upon mee. And now for this time, quoth he, get up upon my Hor&s;e and ride away: And I will be with you anon. And thus they exchanged. To conclude, among the Cadu&s;ians <HI>Rhathonices</HI> was the winner.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Cyrus</HI> did put forth Chariots one to one for to runne a race. And to the Victors he gave both Oxen to &s;acrifice and make merry withall, and al&s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Flaggons.</NOTE> drinking pots. Him&s;elfe being victour al&s;o, received an Oxe, which was the price for victory. But, of the &s;aid flaggons he be&s;towed his part on <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> becau&s;e he thought he had done &s;o well in ordering this riding forth out of the Court. And verily this &s;olemne pompe of riding, as it was in&s;tituted fir&s;t by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;o the King for the time being, continueth &s;till at this day, &s;ave onely that there be no bea&s;ts for &s;acrifice &s;o often as the King &s;acrificeth not. When the&s;e Complements were ended, they returned unto the Citie. And as many as had hou&s;es given them, thither they went: but &s;uch as had none, lodged in their &s;everall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Stations.</NOTE> quarters.</P>

<P>THEN <HI>Pheraulas</HI> invited the Sacan who had be&s;towed upon him the good Hor&s;e, and courteou&s;ly entertained him: but be&s;ide many other gifts which he fa&s;tened upon him in great aboundance, when they had &s;upped togither, hee filled tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Pots.</NOTE> cups (with wine) that hee had received of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> dranke to him and gave them likewi&s;e unto him when hee had done. The Sacan beholding in the place goodly faire carpets and coverings, with much trim furniture be&s;ides, and a number of hou&s;hold &s;ervants. Tell mee <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> quoth he, were you at home al&s;o in your countrey reckoned in the number of rich men? what rich men meane you? &s;aid <HI>Pheraulas.</HI> To bee plaine, I was one of them that got their living by their hands. For, even my father before mee, labouring hard him&s;elfe for a poore living, kept mee bare
<PB N="192" REF="107">and brought mee up with other children at &s;choole. And when I was pa&s;t my childhood, becau&s;e he was not able to finde mee in idlene&s;&s;e, hee had me away with him into the field, &s;etting me to labour and till the ground. Then and there I kept and maintained him likewi&s;e to his dying day, digging and delving with mine owne hands, and &s;owing a peece of land, little though it were in quantity, yet nothing bad (I may &s;ay to you) but of all others mo&s;t true and ju&s;t. For, what &s;eed &s;o ever it tooke, the &s;ame it yeelded againe truly and ju&s;tly, with increa&s;e for u&s;ury though not very great. And yet one time above the re&s;t, upon a &s;peciall fertilitie, it rendred double as much as it received. Thus you &s;ee tru|ly, in what &s;ort I lived at home. But all this riches now that you &s;ee here, <HI>Cyrus</HI> hath freely be&s;towed upon mee.</P>
<P>Happy man are you, quoth the Sacan, as in other re&s;pects &s;o in this, that of a poore man you are become wealthy: For, I &s;uppo&s;e you have much more joy and plea&s;ure in your riches, becau&s;e when you hungred after it, you attai|ned thereto and grew rich. And thinke you, my good Sacan, quoth <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> that I live now much more merrily, for the greater &s;tore of goods that I po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;e? ywis, you are deceived. For, wote you not that I eate, drinke and &s;leepe with no greater contentment one whit, than when I was a poore man. Thus much I gaine by having a great deale, that I mu&s;t looke to the keeping of more than I did, I mu&s;t deale more unto others, I mu&s;t carke and care more, and &s;o by con&s;equence have much adoe. For my hou&s;hold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hines.</NOTE> &s;ervants, many call on mee for meat, many for drinke, and many for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Liveries.</NOTE> garments: And &s;ome of them need the Phy&s;icians. One brings mee word that either my Sheepe are worried by the Woolfe, or mine Oxen falne headlong from &s;ome &s;teepe downe-fall: or el&s;e hee telleth mee, that &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e is come among my cat|taile. Whereby, quoth <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> I am of this minde, that I feele now farre more griefe and &s;orrow by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much, than heretofore, when I had but little.</P>
<P>Yea marry, quoth the Sacan, you &s;ay very true: yet when you &s;ee this world of wealth &s;afe and in good ca&s;e, you take more plea&s;ure than I doe, by ma|ny degrees.</P>
<P>But, it is not, &s;aith <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> &s;o great a joy to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of riches, as griefe to forgoe the &s;ame. Doe but marke what I &s;ay, and you &s;hall finde my words true. There is not one of the&s;e wealthy men driven to breake his &s;leepe for joy, but of &s;uch as lofe ought, you &s;hall not &s;ee one able to &s;leepe for &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Neither &s;hall a man &s;ee, I a&s;&s;ure you, quoth the Sacan, one of them al&s;o to be &s;leepy for joy, that are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, getting.</NOTE> taking any thing. True, &s;aith the other: But the ca&s;e is not alike. For, were it as &s;weet to keepe, as to get, the rich &s;hould be in hap|pier &s;tate by far than the poore. And, tru&s;t mee truly, it cannot be cho&s;en, my Sacan, but he that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth much, mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;pend as much upon the Gods, upon his friends, upon gue&s;ts and &s;trangers comming in. Who&s;oever there|fore taketh great delight in his money and riches, know he this for certaine, that he al&s;o is much vexed, when he is at any expen&s;e.</P>
<P>But, for my part, I prote&s;t before Iupiter, quoth the Sacan, I am none of the&s;e: but I repute even this to be a felicitie, that a man which hath much, may likewi&s;e di&s;-&s;pend much. Why then, before God, quoth <HI>Pheraulas,</HI> what &s;hould let, but that you all of a &s;udden may become very happy, and withall make
<PB N="193" REF="107">mee happy too? For, take in Gods name all that is here: Have and hold it, u&s;e and be&s;tow it at your plea&s;ure. As for mee, doe but finde and maintaine mee as you would your gue&s;t and no otherwi&s;e: Nay, keepe mee more barely than a gue&s;t. For, it &s;hall &s;uffice mee to take part with you of that which you have. You doe but je&s;t with mee, I am &s;ure, quoth the Sacan. With that <HI>Pheraulas</HI> &s;ware unto him and &s;aid, that hee was in good earne&s;t and &s;pake as he thought. Yea, and more than &s;o my good Sacan: I will obtaine of <HI>Cyrus</HI> other things be&s;ides for you: namely, that you &s;hall not bee tyed to waite and give attendance in his Court: not to goe in any voyage and &s;erve in the warres: but remaine &s;till at home with all this wealth. This I &s;ay will I effect both for your &s;ake and mine owne. Over and above, looke what commoditie el&s;e I can procure, either by my dutifull &s;ervice unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> in Court, or by any warlike exploit in the field, I will bring the &s;ame to you, that you may have the rule of more &s;till. Onely doe you thus much for mee, as di&s;charge mee of this care. For may I once be delivered from the&s;e troubles and live at ea&s;e, I thinke you &s;hall &s;tead me much, and I likewi&s;e &s;hall the better &s;erve <HI>Cyrus.</HI> The&s;e words thus pa&s;&s;ed betweene them and as they covenanted, &s;o they did accordingly. The one reputed him&s;elfe happy for being Lord and Ma&s;ter now of &s;o much wealth: the other againe thought he was mo&s;t happy, becau&s;e he &s;hould have a Procurator in his place to procure him re&s;t and lea&s;ure for to doe that which contented his minde. This <HI>Pheraulas</HI> was of a gentle nature, courteous and amiable to his friends, neither thought hee that there was &s;o great plea&s;ure or gaine in making much of any thing as of men. For, he &s;uppo&s;ed, that of all li|ving creatures in the world, man was &s;imply the be&s;t and mo&s;t thankfull: &s;ee|ing as he did and ob&s;erving, tho&s;e that were pray&s;ed by any, how &s;tudious they were to prai&s;e them again, and how they endevoured to requite one kind|ne&s;&s;e and plea&s;ure done, with another: &s;uch as they know to be kinde unto them, how they requite with like affection: whom they &s;ee to love them, how they cannot hate: and as for their parents, how willing they are with all re&s;pect to doe them plea&s;ure and honour both quicke and dead, much more than any o|ther creatures u&s;e to doe in their kinde! For, to &s;peake of all creatures be&s;ide, he perceived they were more unthankefull and le&s;&s;e mindfull of benefits recei|ved than man. Thus therefore was <HI>Pheraulas</HI> wonderous glad, that being free|ed from the care of other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he &s;hould be able to conver&s;e among his friends: as the Sacan al&s;o, becau&s;e in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of much, hee &s;hould hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the fruition of much. Thus the Sacan verily loved <HI>Pheraulas</HI> well, becau&s;e h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> ever brought him &s;omewhat: and <HI>Pheraulas</HI> him likewi&s;e, for that he was realy to take all that came: and notwith&s;tanding he alwaies endeavoured to procure him more and more &s;till, yet it troubled him never the more.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> By what meanes <HI>Cyrus</HI> graced and honoured his friends. The marriage of <HI>Gobryas</HI> his daughter, with <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> one of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Grand-Seigneurs.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had &s;acrificed, he made a fea&s;t for joy of his late victo|rie, and thereto invited tho&s;e friends, that openly had &s;hewed their for|wardne&s;&s;e to advance his State mo&s;t, and their willing minds to do him greate&s;t honour. To whom he adjoyned <HI>Artabazus</HI> the <HI>Median, Tigranes</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> the <HI>Hyrcanian</HI> Commaunder of the Cavallery, and <HI>Gobryas.</HI> As for <HI>Gadatas</HI> he became<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Captaine.</NOTE> Ruler under him of the Scepter-bearers: and according to his direction, all the hou&s;e-keeping of <HI>Cyrus</HI> was ordered. And when there were any at &s;upper with <HI>Cyrus, Gadatas</HI> did not &s;o much as &s;it downe, but tooke the charge of all, and waited: But if no gue&s;t were there, him&s;elfe &s;upped with him: For he tooke delight in his pre&s;ence and company. In regard of which aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cti|on and diligence of his, he was highly e&s;teemed of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and of others in the Court likewi&s;e for <HI>Cyrus</HI> his &s;ake. When gue&s;ts invited to &s;upper came, <HI>Cyrus</HI> placed them not one with another hand over head without re&s;pect: but whom he vouch&s;afed mo&s;t honour, him did he &s;et on his left hand, becau&s;e the &s;ame hand is more expo&s;ed to daunger of wait-laying than the right: the &s;econd in dignity he placed on the right hand, the third againe on the left hand, and the fourth on the right. If there were any more, he mar&s;halled them in the &s;ame order. And he thought it very expedient, to declare how he honoured each one. For, where men &s;uppo&s;e, that he who &s;urpa&s;&s;eth others in worthine&s;&s;e &s;hall receive neither prai&s;e nor prize, evident it is, that there is no emulation among them, who &s;hall excell. But where the be&s;t is &s;eene to be in the highe&s;t place and to have the precedency of the re&s;t, there doe they all with exceeding ala|crity enter into open &s;trife and contention. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> verily after this manner &s;hewed who were of greate&s;t authority and reputation with him, beginning fir&s;t with the order of their &s;itting with him and &s;tanding about him. Howbeit he would not that any man &s;hould challenge that place then a&s;&s;igned as his owne for ever: but he brought up this cu&s;tome as a law, that according to their good and vertuous deeds, they &s;hould be advanced to an higher degree of honour, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d as any one demeaned him&s;elf more ba&s;ely, he &s;hould come down to a lower place. For, <HI>Cyrus</HI> thought it would redound greatly to his owne &s;hame, in ca&s;e any per&s;on promoted to the highe&s;t roome in &s;itting, &s;hould not be &s;eene abroad for to enjoy many ornaments and favours by him. And as in <HI>Cyrus</HI> time the&s;e matters were thus carried, &s;o in the&s;e daies, we under&s;tand the &s;ame order hol|deth &s;till. When they were at &s;upper, <HI>Gobryas</HI> thought it no wonderous matter, that every thing was &s;erved up unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> in &s;o great plenty, being a Prince &s;o pui&s;&s;ant, and the Ruler over &s;o many: but he mervailed rather at this, that having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tchieved &s;o great exploits, if any tooth&s;ome and deinty cates came before him, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> would not enjoy the plea&s;ure thereof alone, but take the paines even to in|trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> his friends about him, for to receive part thereof. Nay, he &s;aw him ma|ny at me, to &s;end unto &s;ome that were ab&s;ent, &s;uch deinties as haply he had a &s;peciall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">nd unto him&s;elfe. Whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e, that after they had
<PB N="185" REF="108">&s;upped them&s;elves, <HI>Cyrus</HI> would &s;end from the very table one way or other, all the di&s;hes as many as they were, whereat <HI>Gobryas,</HI> I was of opinion heretofore, quoth he, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> that you &s;urmounted all other men in military affaires and in leading an armie: but now I prote&s;t and &s;weare by the Gods, that in my con|ceit you excell farre more in humanity than in martiall prowe&s;&s;e. So it is in truth quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and verily a greater plea&s;ure it is unto me, for to &s;hew the deeds of courte&s;ie than of chivalrie. And how &s;o? quoth <HI>Gobryas:</HI> becau&s;e, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the&s;e mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;eene in doing hurt unto men, the other in do|ing them good. After this, when they had drunke moderately, <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> pro|pounded this que&s;tion unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> and &s;aid, Sir, will you not be offended with me, if I aske you that which I de&s;ire to know? No verily, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> but contrariwi&s;e I would be di&s;plea&s;ed with you, if you kept that in which you were minded to aske. Tell me then I pray you quoth he, whether at any time I came not to you when you called for me? Oh quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> no more of that, let us have no &s;uch words. Nay, but was I any whit &s;lacke, &s;aid <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> in com|ming to you? No, neither quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Commaunded you me at any time, that which I performed not accordingly? I can find no fault with you an&s;wered <HI>Cy|rus.</HI> And what&s;oever I did, could you ever perceive me to doe it not cheere|fully, nor with delight and plea&s;ure? No I a&s;&s;ure you quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> For, herein of all other I can lea&s;t find fault with you. What is it then, For the love of God quoth he, and wherein hath <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> &s;o prevailed with you, that hee &s;hould be preferred to a more honourable place than my &s;elfe? Shall I tell you the rea&s;on &s;aith <HI>Cyrus?</HI> what el&s;e, quoth <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas?</HI> And will not you be angry, quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> when you heare the truth? No verily &s;aith <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> but rather very glad will I be, if I may know that I am not wronged. Goe to then, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> you &s;hall under&s;tand, This <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> here, fir&s;t and formo&s;t, never ex|pected untill I &s;ent for him: but was alwaies pre&s;ent to attend and follow our affaires before he was called. Againe, he did not that onely which he was bid|den, but what&s;oever him&s;elf knew expedient for us to be done, that did he. Moreover, if at any time a matter was to be delivered by &s;peech unto our Allies and Confederates, what&s;oever he thought decent for me to &s;ay, therto he would advi&s;e me: But whatever he perceived, I was de&s;irous that our A&s;&s;ociats &s;hould know, but yet upon a ba&s;hfull mode&s;ty, loth my &s;elfe to utter unto them, hee would declare the &s;ame in &s;uch termes, as if it had beene his owne opinion. So that in the&s;e ca&s;es, what can be alleadged to the contrary, but that he is more carefull for my good and commodity, than mine owne &s;elfe. Furthermore, this is his &s;aying that he &s;tands alwaies contented with his pre&s;ent fortune as &s;uffici|ent for him, but for me he &s;heweth him&s;elfe provident and foreca&s;ting in my behalfe, what good I may have by any thing added to my e&s;tate. To conclude, in my welfare, he taketh more joy and plea&s;ure, than I doe my &s;elfe. At the&s;e words, <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> &s;aid, Now &s;o love me, Lady <HI>Iuno,</HI> as it doth me good at the very heart, that I demaunded tho&s;e que&s;tions of you. And why &s;o e&s;pecially? I pray, quoth <HI>Cyrus:</HI> becau&s;e &s;aith he, I will endeavour what I can, to doe the &s;ame. But for one thing, I know not what to doe: namely, how, and in what &s;ort I might &s;hew my affection, when I rejoyce in your good fortune and wel|fare? Whether I mu&s;t clap my hands, or laugh, or what el&s;e I &s;hould do? Here|at <HI>Artabazus,</HI> you ought then, quoth he, to daunce the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> daunce. At which they all laughed a good. Now as the banquet went on &s;till and they began to
<PB N="190" REF="109">drinke more liberally, <HI>Cyrus</HI> demaunded of <HI>Gobryas.</HI> Tell me, <HI>Gobryas,</HI> whe|ther are you more willing now, to be&s;tow your daughter in marriage upon one of the&s;e Gentlemen, than at your fir&s;t acquaintance with us? And will you give me al&s;o leave quoth <HI>Gobryas</HI> to &s;ay a truth? Yea verily, &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> For no que|&s;tion needs to be an&s;wered with a lye. Why then, &s;aith <HI>Gobryas,</HI> know for cer|taine, That much more willing I am now, than heretofore. And can you render a rea&s;on why? quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Yea that I can an&s;wered <HI>Gobryas.</HI> Say on then quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Becau&s;e quoth he I &s;aw them as then, to endure both paines and perils willingly, but now I perceive they can beare pro&s;perity wi&s;ely, and with mo|deration. And truely, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> in my conceit, it is an harder matter to find a man to beare well the favouring, than to brooke the frowning of fortune. For, of the one may grow pride and in&s;olency in many: but the other breedeth mo|de&s;ty and temperance in all. How now <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> faith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> have you heard what an Apophthegme <HI>Gobryas</HI> hath delivered? Yes that I have quoth <HI>Hy&s;ta|&s;pas.</HI> And if he come out with many &s;uch &s;entences, he &s;hall have me &s;ooner to become a &s;uiter unto his daughter, than if he &s;hewed me many drinking cups. And I a&s;&s;ure you &s;aith <HI>Gobryas,</HI> Many of the&s;e and &s;uch like &s;ayings of his, I have put in writing: of which I will not envy you the having, in ca&s;e you e&s;|pou&s;e my daughter. As for drinking cups, becau&s;e me thinks you &s;et no &s;tore by them, I wote not whether you &s;hould doe well to be&s;tow them upon this <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> here, becau&s;e he hath &s;tolen your &s;eat from you. Then <HI>Cyrus,</HI> Certes <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> and yee my friends here pre&s;ent, If yee tell me when any one of you will in hand with marriage, yee &s;hall &s;ee in what good &s;tead I al&s;o will &s;tand you, in your wooing. Then <HI>Gobryas,</HI> If a man would marry forth his daughter, whom &s;hould he acquaint with that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e? Whom but me! quoth <HI>Cyrus?</HI> For I am pa&s;&s;ing good at &s;uch a feat. What feat is that? quoth <HI>Chry&s;antas:</HI> even the skill to know what marriage is meet for each per&s;on. Then, for the love of God quoth <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> Tell me what kind of wife will be&s;t fit me, &amp; be mo&s;t &s;utable to my per&s;on? Fir&s;t, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> a little woman; becau&s;e you are but little your &s;elfe. For if you &s;hould match with one of &s;tature tall, you mu&s;t bee faine to leap up to her, (as the&s;e little dogs doe) when&s;oever you would ki&s;&s;e her upright. In good faith quoth <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> very well con&s;idered of you, For I am nothing made at all for leaping. Then, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> A woman with a flat no&s;e were very meet for you. And why &s;o, &s;aith <HI>Chry&s;antas:</HI> becau&s;e, quoth he, your &s;elfe are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Hawke-no&s;ed.</NOTE> hooke-no&s;ed. For, you know very well, that flat no&s;es and hooked, will couch and clo&s;e be&s;t togither. Say you then, quoth <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> That when one hath &s;upped well, as I now have a wife that goeth &s;upperle&s;&s;e to bed, were meet to lye with him? yes verily quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For they that are full, have round and copped bellies, but their bellies be flat that are empty, and have not had their &s;uppers. But can you tell me for Gods &s;ake, <HI>Cyrus,</HI> what manner of wife is good for a cold King? Herewith <HI>Cyrus</HI> laughed and &s;o did the re&s;t. And as they were altogither &s;et a laughing, In this one point verily quoth <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> I envie you e&s;pecially, in your royall e&s;tate: And, what is that &s;aith <HI>Cyrus,</HI> becau&s;e quoth he being as you are &s;o cold and dry your &s;elfe, yet you can make us all to laugh. And would not you quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> give a great deale, to have the&s;e things told you, and report made unto her of whom you de&s;ire to be &s;o highly e&s;teemed, that you are plea&s;antly conceited? Thus pa&s;&s;ed they the time skoffing and je&s;ting merrily one with another. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="109">brought forth a &s;ute of womans apparaile and omaments thereto for <HI>Tigranes,</HI> which he willed him to give unto his wife, becau&s;e &s;he had borne her &s;elfe man|ly in this expedition, with her husband. To <HI>Artabazus</HI> he gave a cup of gold, and to the <HI>Hyrcanian</HI> Captaine a Cour&s;er, with many other faire and rich gifts. As for you, <HI>Gobryas,</HI> I will be&s;tow upon you an husband for your daughter. Then, me you will give I trow quoth <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> that I may have tho&s;e written &s;entences of his. Why, quoth <HI>Cyrus,</HI> have you any e&s;tate of your owne, an&s;we|rable to the dowry of the Damoi&s;ell? Yea, that I have quoth he, God be thank|ed, and the &s;ame worth much more money. And where I pray you lyeth that wealth of yours? Even there, quoth <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> (pointing to <HI>Cyrus</HI>) where you &s;it that are my friend. And that is enough &s;aid <HI>Gobryas</HI> to content me. And therewith pre&s;ently he raught forth his hand and &s;aid, Give me him <HI>Cyrus,</HI> for I am ready to receive him. Then <HI>Cyrus</HI> taking <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> by the right hand, gave him unto <HI>Gobryas,</HI> who received him accordingly. After this, he be&s;towed up|on <HI>Hy&s;ta&s;pas</HI> many goodly gifts, to &s;end unto the young Lady his &s;pou&s;e: and withall, taking <HI>Chry&s;antas</HI> clo&s;e unto him, he ki&s;&s;ed him. Then <HI>Artabazus,</HI> As <HI>Iupiter</HI> me helpe &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus</HI> quoth he, that cup which you gave unto me, and the gift which you be&s;towed upon <HI>Chry&s;antas,</HI> be not both of the &s;ame gold. But I will quoth <HI>Cyrus</HI> give you the like. And when? asked he: Thirty yeeres hence quoth <HI>Cyrus.</HI> See then quoth he, you order the matter &s;o, and provide again&s;t that time; as from whom I will expect &s;o much, and not dye in the meane while. Thus for that pre&s;ent, ended their fea&s;t and merry meeting. When they were ri&s;en, <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o aro&s;e and accompanied them to the very gates.</P>

<P>THE next day, tho&s;e Allies, who came unto him as voluntaries, he &s;ent home every man, except tho&s;e that de&s;ired to dwell with him: For, he enfeoffed them in hou&s;e and land, to them and their heires for ever. And verily the po&s;terity de&s;cended from tho&s;e who then &s;tayed, enjoy the &s;ame po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to this day. The&s;e for the mo&s;t part, were <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Hyrcanians.</HI> When he had dealt away gifts among them, at their departure, and taken &s;uch order, as neither Captaine nor &s;ouldier had cau&s;e to complaine, hee di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. After this, he di&s;tributed among his owne &s;ouldiers, what money and trea&s;ure he got at <HI>Sardes.</HI> To the Colonels verily over ten thou&s;and men, To the Serjeants and Servitours that attended about his owne per&s;on, he gave pe|culiarly great and &s;ingular gifts, according to the worthine&s;&s;e of every one: The re&s;t he divided here and there among&s;t them all. For, having be&s;towed up|on every &s;uch Colonell, a part, he charged them, that according to the pro|portion which he had delivered unto them, they &s;hould di&s;tribute likewi&s;e un|to
<PB N="198" REF="110">others. And verily the re&s;t of the monies were be&s;towed &s;o, as every Cap|taine approved well of their owne Vnder Captaines: But the la&s;t were divided by the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Captaines over &s;ixe.</NOTE> Sizainieirs, (after they had made proofe of their private &s;ouldiers in their charge) according as they found each one worthy. And thus they all re|ceived, that which was meet in equity. Which large&s;&s;e being done: &s;ome there were, who gave out of <HI>Cyrus</HI> the&s;e or &s;uch like &s;peeches. Certes, he mu&s;t needs have much trea&s;ure him&s;elfe, who hath given to every one of us &s;o liberally. Others againe an&s;wered and &s;aid, And what great thing is it that he hath? It is not the manner of <HI>Cyrus</HI> to &s;eeke wholly to be enriched, but he taketh more plea&s;ure in giving to others, than in keeping for his owne u&s;e. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> perceived what words men gave out, and what opinion they had conceived of him, he a&s;&s;embled his friends with all the men of action and quality, and to this effect &s;pake unto them. I have &s;eene ere now, my good friends, men in the world, who would be thought to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e more than they doe in deed, &s;uppo|&s;ing thereby to appeare more liberall. But in my mind quoth he, they come &s;hort of their reckoning, and are haled away cleane contrary to their intent. For, when a man would be accoumpted rich, and is not &s;eene withall, to bene|fit his friends, after the rate of that wealth, me thinks it is enough to &s;et the brand upon him of ba&s;e illiberality. Againe, there be others, who would not be knowne how rich they are: And they al&s;o in my judgement, de&s;erve but badly of their friends. For, by rea&s;on that their e&s;tate is unknowne, oftentimes, friends in their need acquaint them not therewith, and making no mone unto them are deceived. But I take this to be the part of the be&s;t plaine-dealing man, to make his power and &s;ub&s;tance knowne, and then accordingly to endeavour for to &s;hew his goodne&s;&s;e and hone&s;ty. And therefore what riches of mine may be &s;eene: I am willing of my &s;elfe to &s;hew unto you: and looke what can not be &s;eene, I will relate unto you by word of mouth. Having thus &s;aid, one part of his trea&s;ures, which were many and faire, he gave them leave to &s;ee: the re&s;t that were laid up our of &s;ight, he recoumpted unto them. And in the end, the&s;e words: My friends, This accoumpt yee ought all to make: That the&s;e ri|ches here are no more mine than yours. For, I doe not gather them, either to &s;pend them all my &s;elfe, or to weare them out, which were a thing impo&s;&s;ible: but partly to have evermore about me wherewith I may at all times reward any of you, as he performeth any brave &s;ervice: and partly, that who&s;oever among you thinketh that he &s;tands in need of ought, he may come unto me and receive what he wanteth. And there an end of the&s;e his words.</P>
<P>Now when he had well &s;ettled as he thought his e&s;tate in. <HI>Babylon,</HI> &s;o as he might take a journey abroad, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elfe to make a voiage into <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> and commaunded the re&s;t to be in readine&s;&s;e. And when he &s;uppo&s;ed that he was &s;ufficiently provided of all things needfull and requi&s;ite for &s;uch an expe|dition, he remooved and tooke his journey. But here I purpo&s;e to put downe, how orderly his armie and traine &s;o great as it was, both in taking up their har|bour by the way, unpacked and di&s;charged their carriage, and at their &s;etting forth againe, tru&s;&s;ed up bag and baggage, as al&s;o how quickly they made &s;tay and &s;at downe in any place, as need required. For, where ever the King encamp|eth, they all pitch their tents about him, as well in &s;ummer as in winter. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> verily at the fir&s;t ordained, that his owne Pavilion &s;hould be &s;et &s;o, as it might have pro&s;pect into the Ea&s;t: then, he appointed how farre off, from his
<PB N="199" REF="110">Royall tent, the Guard and Pen&s;ioners &s;hould quarter and have their lodgings. After them, he a&s;&s;igned for the bakers the right hand; and for the cooks and victuallers the left. He appointed for the hor&s;es [of &s;ervice] the right &s;ide, and for the other labouring and draught bea&s;ts the left. Semblably all things el&s;e were dige&s;ted &s;o, as that every man knew his owne place, as well by mea&s;ure as by the plot of ground. Now, when they di&s;lodge and are upon their remoove, every man packeth up &s;uch baggage as he is appointed to u&s;e. Others there be againe, ready to lay them upon the Sumpter bea&s;ts: whereby it comes to pa&s;&s;e, that all the porters and carriers come together unto tho&s;e packs and tru&s;&s;es, that they are appointed to bring, and every one at once layeth his owne &s;tuffe upon his owne bea&s;ts. So that the &s;ame time that &s;erveth for the pitching and &s;etting up of one tent, is &s;ufficient for all. And at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant, were all car|riages di&s;charged and laid downe likewi&s;e. Moreover, every man had his charge what to doe, for purveying of victuals and all nece&s;&s;aries in due &s;ea&s;on: &s;o, that one and the &s;ame time &s;erveth for one part and for all, to make provi&s;ion there|of. And as there was a &s;everall place &s;et by for the purveyours of nece&s;&s;aries meet for them, &s;o his armed &s;ouldiers in pitching of the campe, had that quar|ter which was convenient for each kind of armature and munitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">. They knew al&s;o which it was; and in generall held and occupied it &s;o as they never differed about it. Certes, even in a private hou&s;e and family, <HI>Cyrus</HI> thought it a &s;peciall matter, to be carefull for the order and fit placing of every thing in it. (For, if one hath need of ought, he is not to &s;eeke whither to goe and where to find it) but he &s;uppo&s;ed it was a much more excellent thing, that in a campe the milita|ry tribes and regiments &s;hould be placed in good and convenient order. For, by how much, the occa&s;ions in warre be more &s;odaine, &s;o much the greater is their delinquency, who &s;lacke any time and be tardy therein. But in warfare, he &s;aw that exploits of great con&s;equence, were performed by tho&s;e that were rea|dy at hand in due time. In which regard, very diligent and carefull he was, to have every thing placed fitly and in order. Fir&s;t of all, he tooke up a lodging for him&s;elfe, in the mids of the Campe, becau&s;e that place was &s;tronge&s;t. Then had he next about him (as his manner ever was,) his tru&s;tie&s;t men: and round about them the men of armes and chariotiers. For, he &s;uppo&s;ed it needfull for them, to quarter in a place of &s;ecurity: becau&s;e, if any &s;odaine Al-arme be gi|ven in the Campe, they have not u&s;e of their armes out of hand: but their &s;er|vice requireth a long time ere they can be armed, in ca&s;e they meane to goe forth with them into the field for to doe any good. Moreover on either hand, as well the left as the right, both of him&s;elfe and of his &s;aid hor&s;emen, the Ia|velotiers with their light bucklers were planted: but behind and before, the Ar|chers. As for the &s;ouldiers heavily armed and &s;uch as bare ma&s;&s;ie targuets, they compa&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t, in manner of a wall: to the end that when need was, that the hor&s;emen &s;hould make them&s;elves ready, the&s;e &s;ouldiers &s;o well appointed &s;tanding afore them might abide the longe&s;t brunt, and give them re&s;pit and time enough to arme in &s;afety. And like as tho&s;e heavily armed &s;ouldiers lodg|ed and &s;lept keeping their order and array &s;til, even &s;o did the Iavelotiers lightly armed and the Archers. That if any Al-arme were in the night, like as tho&s;e are pre&s;t to wound the a&s;&s;ailants clo&s;e at hand, &s;o the&s;e Archers and Darters might be as ready to &s;hoot their arrowes, and launce their Iavelins from them in the defence of tho&s;e armed &s;ouldiers, if any enemies approached and affronted
<PB N="200" REF="111">them. Furthermore all the Captaines had certaine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or, Banners.</NOTE> En&s;ignes upon their Pavi|lions: By which meanes, like as in Cities, the wi&s;er &s;ort can point unto the dwelling hou&s;es of mo&s;t Citizens, but e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are of employment: even &s;o the mini&s;ters and &s;ervitours of <HI>Cyrus</HI> knew in what places to find their Captains and what En&s;ignes or colours belonged to every one. And thereby, if <HI>Cyrus</HI> had occa&s;ion to u&s;e any of them, they needed not to &s;eeke up and downe, but ran readily the next way to every one. And becau&s;e each nation was apart and not intermingled one with another, it was much &s;ooner &s;eene, both when any kept his owne ranke in order as al&s;o whether they did not that which was commaunded. Being thus mar&s;halled, he thought that if any enemie either by night or day a&s;&s;ailed him, they &s;hould come upon his campe no otherwi&s;e, than if they fell into a place of ambu&s;hment. And, for a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">one that pro|fe&s;&s;eth the skill to embartaile an Army.</NOTE> Tactick, he thought it re|qui&s;ite, not onely to know how, readily to &s;tretch out in length the front of his Phalang, or di&s;play and &s;pread it out in depth, or reduce it from a pointed wing, into a ma&s;&s;ie &s;quadron, or to countermarch as readily the enemy being di&s;|covered and to wind about with it, in good &s;ort, on the right hand, or on the left, or in the reare: but he &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o, it appertained to that skill, for to be able to divide it if need required, and each part thereof to be&s;tow for mo&s;t ad|vantage, yea and to lead it on &s;peedily, where occa&s;ion is of prevention. All the&s;e points, and &s;uch like feats he thought did belong to that Captaine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> which is expert in the ordinance of a battaile: And even &s;o right carefull and &s;tudious was he in them all. And verily in his journeies he marched with his ho&s;t, not alwaies alike and in the &s;ame order, but evermore accommodated to divers oc|currents and &s;odaine accidents: Howbeit in the pitching of his campe, he u&s;ed for the mo&s;t part this di&s;po&s;e, which I have rehear&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now when they had journeyed &s;o farre as they were come into the <HI>Medes</HI> countrey, <HI>Cyrus</HI> turned in to <HI>Cyaxares</HI> for to lodge with him. And after they had embraced one another, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;aid fir&s;t to <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> that there was provided for him in <HI>Babylon,</HI> a choice dwelling hou&s;e with &s;tately edifices: that if he came thither he might keepe his Court there, as in his owne. Then, be&s;towed he up|on him very many and tho&s;e right goodly pre&s;ents. <HI>Cyaxares</HI> when he had re|ceived them at his hands, &s;ent his daughter unto him: who brought with her for him a golden Coronet, a paire of bracelets and a collar of gold, with a mo&s;t beautifull <HI>Median</HI> robe. Here, quoth <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> I give unto you <HI>Cyrus,</HI> this young Lady mine owne daughter to be your wedded wife. For &s;o, your father e&s;pou|&s;ed my fathers daughter, who&s;e &s;onne you are. And this is even very &s;he, whom you being a child, many a time in our hou&s;e, were wont to &s;port with and dandle as a nurceling. And when any one asked her, who&s;e wife &s;he would be? &s;he was wont to make an&s;wer, that <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;hould be her husband. And with her, I give over and above, for a dowry the Kingdome of <HI>Media,</HI> and enfeoffe her wholly in it, &s;ince I have no i&s;&s;ue male of mine owne legitimate. Thus &s;aid <HI>Cyaxares.</HI> Vnto whom <HI>Cyrus</HI> made this an&s;wer. The parentage, good Vnkle <HI>Cyaxares,</HI> I commend, The young maiden I prai&s;e, and of the dowry I like well enough: but before I conclude of a marriage, I will have the con&s;ent of my father and mother. And albeit <HI>Cyrus</HI> thus &s;aid, yet be&s;towed he upon the Damoi&s;ell, all tho&s;e gifts, wherein he thought hee might gratifie <HI>Cyaxares.</HI> Which done hee tooke his leave and went forward on his journey for <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> How <HI>Cyrus</HI> arrived in Per&s;ia, where <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> treateth with him and his Lords and chiefe Commanders about the affaires of State. How hee tooke to wife the daughter of <HI>Cyaxares:</HI> and being returned to Ba|bylon, &s;ent Rulers and Deputies into all his Provinces.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN he was come &s;o farre as into the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the re&s;t of his forces he left there: and went him&s;elfe accompanied with his friends to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Su&s;a.</NOTE> City: bringing with him as well bea&s;ts &s;uffici|ent both to &s;acrifice, and al&s;o to fea&s;t the whole nation of the <HI>Per&s;ians:</HI> as gifts meet to pre&s;ent unto his father and mother and other his friends there: yea and &s;uch as might be&s;eeme the Head Magi&s;trates, Auncients, and noble Gentlemen called <HI>Homotimi,</HI> in generall. Moreover he gave a large&s;&s;e among all the <HI>Per&s;i|ans</HI> both men and women, even &s;uch congiaries as at this day the King u&s;eth to deale among them, when&s;oever he commeth into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> After this, <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> a&s;&s;embled a Councell of the Elders of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> togither with &s;uch Rulers as had the menaging of the weightie&s;t affaires in Common-wealth. Who being come togither, he called <HI>Cyrus</HI> al&s;o unto them, and then made a &s;peech to this effect. My Lords of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and you likewi&s;e my &s;onne <HI>Cyrus:</HI> I heartily affect you all, as good rea&s;on I have, both the one and the other. For, as I am your King, &s;o you <HI>Cyrus</HI> are my &s;onne. Meet it is therefore, and in all congruence it be&s;ee|meth, that I open here before you, what&s;oever I may &s;eeme to know, concer|ning your good and welfare. As for you the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> in times pa&s;t yee ho|noured my &s;onne, when yee did put an armie into his hands, and cho&s;e him Ge|nerall thereof. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> being once the Commaunder of that power, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God hath made you <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> renowned with all men and honoured throughout all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> And verily, as the valiante&s;t Knights of tho&s;e that &s;erved under him, he hath enriched, &s;o to the very multitude of Common &s;ouldiers, he hath truly paid their wages and found them food. Moreover, by erecting a Cavallery among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> he hath effected, that they be as good hor&s;emen upon the plaines as others. If yee therefore hereafter per&s;i&s;t in this mind &s;till, yee &s;hall procure one unto another manifold commodities. But if either you for your part <HI>Cyrus,</HI> being puffed up for the late good &s;ucce&s;&s;e of fortune, &s;hall goe about to be an ab&s;olute Lord over the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> thereby to make a private gaine of them, as over other nations: or yee that are natives and &s;ubjects, envi|ous of his pui&s;&s;ance, endeavour and practi&s;e to depo&s;e him, and overthrow his royall e&s;tate, know this for certaine, that yee &s;hall hinder one another in the atchieving of many great and noble exploits. To the end therefore, that the&s;e inconveniences befall not unto you, that yee may enjoy all good ble&s;&s;ings, I have thought it meet after we have &s;acrificed togither and called the Gods to record, to make this covenant, that you <HI>Cyrus</HI> for your part in the behalfe of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> if any one either enterprize the inva&s;ion of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> land, or at|tempt to breake and abrogate the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> lawes, &s;hall be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to them with all your might: and yee likewi&s;e, that are <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> if either any Alien goe about to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e <HI>Cyrus</HI> of his Kingdome, or if &s;ubjects rebell and revolt
<PB N="202" REF="112">from him, &s;hall be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t both your &s;elves and <HI>Cyrus,</HI> according to his Commandement. And verily &s;o long as God &s;hall lend me life, mine is the Kingdome of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> but after my decea&s;e, <HI>Cyrus</HI> &s;hall be King thereof, if he &s;ur|vive. Who, when he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As King.</NOTE> once come into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;hall do well and devoutly to offer &s;acrifices for you, like as now my &s;elfe doth &s;acrifice. But whiles he makes his abode in another country, I &s;uppo&s;e it will be expedient for you, that one of our line and blood, whom yee thinke the very be&s;t, performe that which appertai|neth to religion and the wor&s;hip of God. When <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> had uttered the&s;e words, both <HI>Cyrus</HI> and the Rulers al&s;o of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> agreed thereto, and by enacting a decree ratified the &s;ame. And as they then capitulated and pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e Cove|nants, calling the Gods to witne&s;&s;e, &s;o at this time, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and their King doe con&s;tantly ob&s;erve the &s;ame.</P>
<P>After the&s;e affaires thus accompli&s;hed, <HI>Cyrus</HI> departed, and when he was re|turned backe into <HI>Media,</HI> by the con&s;ent both of his father and mother, he tooke to wife the daughter of <HI>Cyaxares</HI> afore&s;aid: of whom the &s;peech goes even at this day, that &s;he was exceeding beautifull. Howbeit, &s;ome Hi&s;toriographers there be, who write that he wedded his mothers &s;i&s;ter. But &s;he had beene doubtle&s;&s;e by this time an old &s;tale woman and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> no fre&s;h Damoi&s;ell. No &s;ooner was the marriage &s;olemnized, but pre&s;ently he tooke her with him and departed.</P>
<P>After he was come to <HI>Babylon,</HI> he thought good now to &s;end Lieutenants Ge|nerall and Pre&s;idents into tho&s;e nations which he had &s;ubdued. As for the Cap|taines of Garri&s;on-Ca&s;tles, and tho&s;e Colonels likewi&s;e over thou&s;ands, who had the keeping of the country, he would not have them to obey any but him|&s;elfe. For, this foreca&s;t he had (con&s;idering how it would prejudice his owne State, in ca&s;e any of tho&s;e Rulers and Lieutenants, pre&s;uming upon their wealth and the multitude of men under them &s;hould beare them&s;elves in&s;olently, and &s;hake off the yoke of their alleageance) namely to have in readine&s;&s;e within the Countrey, &s;uch as would make head again&s;t them. Intending therefore to bring this about, fir&s;t he thought it good policy, to call togither the chiefe Gen|tlemen of &s;ort, and to declare this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e unto them, that they might take knowledge upon what motives they went thither who were to be &s;ent. For, by this meanes he thought they would take it the better. But if any &s;uch were ap|pointed Governours and Deputies fir&s;t, and then afterwards &s;hould under&s;tand &s;o much, he &s;uppo&s;ed they would beare it hard, as who might thinke all this was done for their infidelity and his di&s;tru&s;t in them. Having therefore a&s;&s;embled tho&s;e [principall Gentlemen] togither, hee &s;pake much after this manner unto them! My good friends, we have in tho&s;e Cities which we won, both garri&s;on &s;ouldiers and al&s;o Captaines over them, &s;uch as then wee left behind us: unto whom at my departure I gave no other charge bu&s;ily to meddle in, but only to defend their Forts. And tho&s;e &s;urely will I not put out of their places of Go|vernment: con&s;idering they have duly ob&s;erved their commi&s;&s;ion. But other De|puties and Governours I meane to &s;end, for to be Pre&s;idents over the people and inhabitants of the countries, who gathering tribute and receiving the revenues of the State, are to pay the garri&s;on &s;ouldiers their wages, and to performe all &s;ervices nece&s;&s;arie: Al&s;o, to as many of you as here live, and whom I employ a|bout my affaires in foraine parts: I thinke it meet, whiles I &s;end them away unto the&s;e nations about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;&s;es which they are to menage, for to a&s;&s;igne hou&s;e and lands there, to the end that tribute may be brought hither unto them,
<PB N="203" REF="112">and when they come thither, they may be lodged and entertained in their owne. When he had thus &s;aid, he gave hou&s;es and &s;ubjects to commaund, in all the ci|ties which he had conquered. And even at this day, the po&s;terity de&s;cended from them, who at that time received the&s;e Donaitons, remaine &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e lands, &s;ituate and lying, &s;ome in one countrey, and &s;ome in another: whereas, they them&s;elves abide at the Court with the King. But nece&s;&s;ary it is moreover, quoth he, that yee con&s;ider of tho&s;e Deputies and Governours who are to goe into the&s;e Provinces; that they be &s;uch, as will be mindfull, to &s;end hi|ther al&s;o what good thing and &s;peciall commodity there is in each land: to the end that we al&s;o re&s;iding here, may be partakers of all the profits, that any coun|try yeeldeth where&s;oever. For, if any fearefull and dangerous object &s;hould pre|&s;ent it &s;elfe unto them, we mu&s;t for our parts defend them. Thus having &s;aid, he concluded his &s;peech. And then &s;uch friends of his, as he knew de&s;irous to goe upon tho&s;e termes above&s;aid, he made choi&s;e of, and &s;ent them as Lords-De|puties who were in his judgement, mo&s;t meet and worthy, to wit, into <HI>Arabia, Megaby&s;tus;</HI> into <HI>Cappadocia Artabatas; Artacamas</HI> into <HI>Phrygia</HI> the great: and <HI>Chry|&s;antas</HI> into <HI>Lycia</HI> and <HI>Ionia.</HI> Into <HI>Caria, Cadu&s;ius</HI> according to the <HI>Carians</HI> reque&s;t. Into <HI>Phrygia</HI> lying upon <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> and into <HI>Aecolis, Pharnuchus.</HI> But into <HI>Cilicia, Cyprus,</HI> and to the <HI>Paphlagonians</HI> he &s;ent no Governors, becau&s;e they &s;eemed of their owne accord and un&s;ent for, to joyne with him in the journey of <HI>Babylon.</HI> Howbeit, the&s;e nations al&s;o he commaunded to bring in their tribute. And as <HI>Cyrus</HI> ordained it in tho&s;e daies, &s;o at this time al&s;o: the garri&s;ons in every Ca&s;tle, are at the Kings di&s;po&s;e. The Colonels al&s;o over every 1000. of garri&s;on &s;oul|diers, are by the King appointed, and their names enrolled and remaining with the King.</P>
<P>Furthermore he gave all tho&s;e LL. Governours in charge whom he &s;ent out, to endeavour with all their whole power for to imitate his example in all things that they &s;aw him to doe. Fir&s;t and principally, to ordaine a troupe of hor&s;e|men and Chariotiers, out of tho&s;e <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and Allies who followed them in their traine. And as many as were endowed with Lands and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, faire bou&s;es.</NOTE> Palaces, to force them to give attendance ordinarily at the [<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Court] to the end that being &s;tudiou&s;ly given to temperance, they might &s;hew them&s;elves ready to be em|ployed by the Lord Governour as occa&s;ion required. Al&s;o their children to be trained up at the Court, like as the manner was with him. Item, that each Vice|roy or Governour afore&s;aid, &s;hould bring tho&s;e his Courteours attending upon him, forth a hunting, and to exerci&s;e both him&s;elfe and tho&s;e about him in &s;uch di&s;ports and pa&s;times as tend unto warfare. And who&s;oever &s;aith he in propor|tion of his pui&s;&s;ance and regiment, &s;hall be able to &s;hew unto me mo&s;t charriots meet for &s;ervice, the greate&s;t number likewi&s;e of hor&s;emen right expert and skilfull, him will I honour and reward as a &s;ingular A&s;&s;ociate in warre, him will I con&s;ider, as a &s;peciall pre&s;erver with me both of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Empire and mine. Let there be al&s;o quoth he among you certaine degrees of &s;eats, and &s;ee that the be&s;t warriours and mo&s;t valiant Knights, &s;it in higher place, as it is the order with me.

See likewi&s;e that ye be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of parks, and keepe wild bea&s;ts in them for game: and never either your &s;elves cau&s;e meat to be &s;et upon the bourd, be|fore
<PB N="204" REF="113">yee have laboured, nor give your hor&s;es hay, unle&s;&s;e they be fir&s;t exerci&s;ed. For, it is not po&s;&s;ible that I being one man alone, with all the humane wi&s;e|dome and prowe&s;&s;e that is, &s;hould pre&s;erve the weale of you all: but nece&s;&s;arie it is, that I being a valiant per&s;on my &s;elfe, &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t you with mine owne al&s;o and tho&s;e redoubted Knights.

Of all them that be pre|&s;ent in ordinary, they who have carried them&s;elves be&s;t, are graced with higher &s;eats above the re&s;t: all their journeyes are likewi&s;e appointed and di&s;po&s;ed. And generally many matters are compendiou&s;ly di&s;patched by few Gover|nours. When he had given this charge to the&s;e Lieutenants and Deputies, how every one was to frame and dige&s;t his affaires: and withall a&s;&s;igned unto each of them a certaine power of &s;ouldiers, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, with a warning given to them all, to prepare them&s;elves and be in readine&s;&s;e: For that the yeere next en&s;uing, he intended an expedition, and meant to review and mu&s;ter all his men, hor&s;es and chariots. Which laudable cu&s;tome being fir&s;t begun by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> wee under&s;tand, (by report) continueth &s;till. For, hereupon &s;ome great man or other yeerely vi&s;iteth the Provinces with an army: Who, if any one of the fore&s;aid Governours &s;tands in need, is ready to helpe: if any beare him&s;elfe in&s;olently, him he reduceth into order, and teacheth to be wi&s;er. Is there any one that neg|lecteth the bringing in of Tribute? is &s;lacke in protecting the inhabitants? or looketh not to the ground that it be tilled and husbanded; or leaveth ought el&s;e undone that is commaunded, he it is that brings all into good frame againe: but if he cannot effect this by him&s;elfe, he giveth notice thereof to the King. Then he no &s;ooner heareth the matter, but con&s;ulteth deliberately about the party thus delinquent. And oftentimes they, of whom it is commonly &s;aid, <HI>The Kings &s;onne commeth downe: The Kings brother; The Kings Eye, &amp;c.</HI> be the Vi|&s;itours and Over&s;eers: yea &s;ometimes when they are not &s;eene at all them&s;elves. For every one of the&s;e is called backe againe out of the way, when&s;oever the King commaundeth.</P>
<P>Moreover we are given to under&s;tand of another invention of <HI>Cyrus</HI> (which concerneth the greatne&s;&s;e of his Empire) whereby he quickly had intelligence brought unto him, how the State of things went. For knowing by experience, how farre an hor&s;e would carry a man in a day without tyring, hee appointed &s;table-roomes di&s;tant &s;o much one from another, and therein po&s;t-hor&s;es and per&s;ons of purpo&s;e to looke unto them. He appointed al&s;o in every of the&s;e places, a man, fit both to receive packets of letters, and to deliver them as they were brought: Who al&s;o &s;hould take the weary hor&s;es, and make &s;upply with fre&s;h, to &s;end forward. And it is &s;aid, that otherwhiles this manner of riding po&s;t, gave not over all night: but after the day-me&s;&s;enger; immediately &s;uccee|ded another for the night. Which being thus ordered, &s;ome &s;ay, that his po&s;ts
<PB N="205" REF="113">di&s;patched their journeyes fa&s;ter than Cranes flye. Which &s;aying if it be not true, yet thus much at lea&s;t wi&s;e is evident, that of all journeyes by land, it is of greate&s;t &s;peed. And this good came thereof, that &s;o &s;oone as one perceived any occurrent, the &s;ame was looked unto with all expedition.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> The expeditions that <HI>Cyrus</HI> made during his reigne, and how hee returned into Per&s;ia, and there dyed.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a yeere come and gone, <HI>Cyrus</HI> a&s;&s;embled all his forces at the Ren|dez-vouz in Babylon. And the report goeth, that he was able to bring into the field 120000 men of Armes; of &s;ithed Chariots 2000. of footmen, to the number of 600000. Which power being come togither and in readine&s;&s;e, he entred into that expedition, wherein he is &s;aid to have conque|red all tho&s;e nations that inhabit, as farre as from the entrance of Syria unto the red Sea.</P>
<P>After this, he made they &s;ay another voyage, wherein he &s;ubdued Aegypt. From which time the Empire of <HI>Cyrus</HI> extended, Ea&s;t to the red Sea: North, to the Euxine Sea. We&s;tward it confined with Cyprus and Aegypt: South-ward, with Aethiopia. The bounds and marches of which Countryes, &s;ome be hard|ly inhabited for heat, others for cold: &s;ome for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Wet.</NOTE> water, others for drought.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> him&s;elfe living in the very mids of the&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the winter &s;ea&s;on for &s;euen moneths in Babylon (for it is a warme climate) the three &s;pring moneths at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In Per&s;ia.</NOTE> Su&s;a: the extreme heat of &s;ummer for the &s;pace of two moneths in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In Media.</NOTE> Ec|batana. In &s;o doing, he led his life all the yeere long in the temperate heat and cold of the Spring. And &s;o affectionately beloved was <HI>Cyrus</HI> of all men, that people of every Nation, thought it went not well with them, if they &s;ent not unto him a pre&s;ent of what rarities either grew, or were fed, or made by art in their country. Semblably, there was not a Citie or private per&s;on any where, but he tooke him&s;elfe made for ever, in ca&s;e he could doe a plea&s;ure unto <HI>Cyrus.</HI> For, as <HI>Cyrus</HI> received of every one &s;uch things, whereof the givers had plen|tie, &s;o he be&s;towed liberally upon them againe, what he knew was gea&s;on and &s;carce with them.</P>
<P>When he had lived thus untill he was farre &s;tept in yeeres, being very aged he made a journey into Per&s;ia, which was the &s;eventh voyage thither after hee came unto his Empire. By which time his father and mother (as by cour&s;e of nature) had beene long dead. Where, after he had &s;acrificed according to the lawes, and &s;olemnly led the daunce among the Per&s;ians, after the manner of the countrey, and as his cu&s;tome was, dealt gifts among them all, as hee lay a&s;leepe one time within the Palace, he dreamed, and &s;aw &s;uch a vi&s;ion as this: Him thought that one came unto him re&s;embling a per&s;onage more venerable and fuller of maje&s;tie than any mortall wight, and &s;aid, Prepare thy &s;elfe, &ocirc; <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to a journey, for &s;hortly thou &s;halt depart unto the Gods. With this dreame and vi&s;ion he awoke and &s;eemed in manner to take full knowledge, that the end of his life was neere at hand. Whereupon he tooke immediatly bea&s;ts for &s;acrifice, and &s;lew them to the honour of Iupiter the Patron and tutelar God of his native countrey, to the Sunne likewi&s;e, and to other Gods re&s;iant upon
<PB N="206" REF="114">the tops of the mountaines (for &s;o the Per&s;ians u&s;e to &s;acrifice) and then to this effect conceived his Orai&s;ons.</P>
<P>O Iupiter Protectour of this my native &s;oyle, &ocirc; Sunne, and all yee other Gods, accept of the&s;e Sacrifices, as the ab&s;olute perfection and finiall of many noble and excellent Actions: as the tokens be&s;ide, of thanks-giving unto you, for that yee have &s;ignified unto mee, as well by the entrails of &s;acrificed bea&s;ts, as cele&s;tiall &s;ignes: as well by augury of birds as pre&s;aging O&s;&s;es, what I was to doe in all my affaires, and what not? Many-fold thanks of dutie I render un|to you, for that I have alwaies agnized your e&s;peciall care over mee, and never in all my fortunate and triumphant &s;tate, exalted my &s;elfe aboue the condition of a mortall man. And now I humbly be&s;eech you vouch&s;afe unto my chil|dren, wife, friends, and native country, long felicitie. And in mine owne be|halfe I crave this grace, that yee would grant unto mee &s;uch an end, as may be an&s;werable to the life ye gave me. When he had thus done and returned home to his Palace, he had a minde gently to take his plea&s;ant repo&s;e, and thereupon quietly laid him downe upon his bed. Now when bathing time was, his Groomes and Chamberlaines for that office appointed, came in and put him in minde to wa&s;h&punc; but he an&s;wered them, that hee &s;weetly tooke his re&s;t. Others likewi&s;e according to their place; when due time was, &s;et his &s;upper before him. But <HI>Cyrus</HI> his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, minde <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> &s;tomacke &s;tood to no meat, as &s;eeming rather thir&s;ty &amp; de&s;irous of drinke: Whereupon he dranke with delight: Thus it fared with him the morrow, and likewi&s;e the third day. By which time, hee called for his &s;onnes: who fortuned then to be in Per&s;ia as having accompanied their father thither. He &s;ent al&s;o for his friends and the chiefe Lords and Rulers of Per&s;ia. When they were all come togither, he began in this wi&s;e to &s;peake unto them.</P>
<P>My children, and yee my friends all, that be here in pre&s;ence: The end of my life, as I evidently perceive by many &s;ignes, draweth on apace, and is now come. Your parts it is therefore, &s;o &s;oone as I am departed this world, both to &s;ay and doe by mee in all re&s;pects, as a ble&s;&s;ed and happy man. For, as during my childhood I was thought to have envied the be&s;t things meet and commen|dable for that age: &s;o, in my youth I reaped the fruit of &s;uch actions as be&s;ee|med young yeeres. Likewi&s;e, being growne to the maturitie of mans e&s;tate, I had the benefit of tho&s;e deeds, which were an&s;werable to mens ripene&s;&s;e and perfection. Yea and as I waxed &s;till elder and elder, me thought I perceived my &s;trength with progre&s;&s;e of time to encrea&s;e ever more and more. In &s;o much as I never found mine old age feebler, than the prime of my youth. Nor re|member I, that I ever enterprized or de&s;ired ought in my heart, but I atchieved the &s;ame. My friends verily have I &s;eene by my meanes made fortunate: but mine enemies brought into &s;ervitude. Mine owne countrey, which heretofore was of no accompt nor commaund in A&s;ia, I leave now ennobled and in &s;ove|rain honour above others. And of all that ever I wonne and got, I know not what one parcell, I have not held and kept &s;till. And albeit for the time pa&s;t, all matters have &s;ucceeded to my hearts de&s;ire, yet for that I was accompanied with a certaine feare, le&s;t I might for the future, &s;ee, heare, or feele &s;ome adver&s;e calamitie, the &s;ame would not permit me to be hautie and proud at all, nor yet over-joyous for my pre&s;ent fortunes: And now, if I my &s;elfe forgoe this tran|&s;itory life, yet yee my &s;onnes whom God hath given mee, I leave &s;urviving be|hind mee. My country al&s;o and friends in ble&s;&s;ed ca&s;e: How can it then bee
<PB N="207" REF="114">otherwi&s;e, but that in regard of this my &s;tate, I &s;hould of right be compted happy and renowmed for ever among men? As for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in my Em|pire, I ought to declare my will and plea&s;ure in that behalfe al&s;o: le&s;t if it be doubtfull, unto whom I make over the &s;ame, it may breed difference and trou|ble among you when I am gone. Children mine, liefe and deare, I love you both alike: but yet I will and ordaine, that the elder of you twaine, and who by good rea&s;on in regard of his yeeres, is more experienced in the world, &s;hall both for policie and coun&s;ell menage the affaires of State: and al&s;o have the commaund and conduct<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of forces.</NOTE> in all occa&s;ions needfull and requi&s;it. I have my &s;elfe beene &s;o brought up, according to the di&s;cipline of your countrey and mine, as that I have learned to give place unto mine elders, not brethren onely, but other natives al&s;o, in the way as I meet them, in &s;itting al&s;o and making any &s;peeches. And even &s;o have I trained you up my &s;onnes, from the beginning, to honour above others aged per&s;ons, and likewi&s;e to be duly honoured your &s;elves, of your youngers. And therefore take this adverti&s;ement, which I de|liver unto you, as from one who pronounceth nothing el&s;e but things received of old, accu&s;tomable, and agreeable to the lawes. As for you <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> enter upon the maine Empire, which preeminence the Gods above, and my &s;elfe, as much as lyeth in me, doe here devolve unto you. But unto you <HI>Tanoaxeres,</HI> I bequeath the principalitie of the Medes and Armenians togither, with a third<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or, Seignory</NOTE> Satrapie over the Cadu&s;ians. In be&s;towing the&s;e Seignories upon you, I &s;uppo&s;e that I leave a greater dominion indeed, and the name of an ab&s;olute Roialtie unto your elder brother, but certenly to you I bequeath a felicitie and happie e&s;tate, more void of trouble, and freed from all vexation. For, I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;ee not what worldly plea&s;ure you can want. Certes, you &s;hall enjoy all things on earth, that may bring delight and content unto man. But the de|&s;ire and affection to difficult enterprizes hardly to be atchieved, the bu&s;ie cares in many affaires, a re&s;tle&s;&s;e cour&s;e of life, whiles the minde is &s;ollicited and pricked with the emulation of mine acts and worthy exploits: to lye in wait and e&s;piall for &s;ome, to bee forelayed and live in feare of the practices of o|thers: The&s;e be the troubles and dangers that of nece&s;&s;itie accompany a Sove|raigne Monarch more than you. And the&s;e things, wote you well, interrupt ones joy with manifold troubles. And you my &s;onne <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> I would have you to know, that it is not this golden Scepter that is able to pre&s;erve your Kingdome and Royall e&s;tate. But many friends and tho&s;e tru&s;ty, are unto Kings the true&s;t appay and &s;ure&s;t Scepter to re&s;t upon. And never thinke that men are naturally borne faithfull friends unto you (for if that were &s;o, the &s;ame men would be true and loyall unto all: like as other things in one nature are &s;eene to bee the &s;ame unto all indifferently,) But every Prince mu&s;t him&s;elfe make men tru&s;ty and fa&s;t unto him: and made they are &s;uch, not by force, but rather by beneficence and bountie. If you therefore would gaine others unto you, for to bee a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the pre&s;ervation of your royaltie, begin not at any other before him, who is &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;tocke that you are, to wit, your owne brother. And verily you &s;ee, that naturall Citizens are more neere|ly linked unto us than &s;trangers: &s;uch as eate, drinke, and daily conver&s;e with us, more than tho&s;e that live apart and be unacquainted with us. They then, that are come of one &s;eed and the &s;ame blood, nouri&s;hed by the &s;ame mother, brought up in the &s;ame hou&s;e, loved of the &s;ame parents, calling one father
<PB N="208" REF="115">and one mother, how can the&s;e otherwi&s;e be but of all others mo&s;t inward and familiar? Suffer not then, tho&s;e good ble&s;&s;ings to be in vaine be&s;towed upon you, whereby the very Gods lead brethren to the entertainment of mutuall amitie: but over and above this foundation already laid, build forthwith other workes of love: and thus your reciprocall friend&s;hip &s;hall continue for ever invincible. And to &s;ay a truth, he regardeth his owne &s;elfe, who taketh care of his brother. For, unto what other per&s;on is a brother (if he be a mightie man) &s;uch an ornament as to his brother? And who be&s;ide is able to honour a pui&s;&s;ant Potentate &s;o much as a brother? And whom will a man, having a great per&s;on to his brother feare to wrong, &s;o much as hee will his owne bro|ther? See therefore that no man obey him &s;ooner, nor be readier to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t him than your &s;elfe. For neither his pro&s;peritie, nor adver&s;itie concernes any man more properly than you. Con&s;ider moreover in gratifying whom, you &s;hould hope to gaine more or winne greater thanke, than if you doe your brother a plea&s;ure? In &s;uccouring, &s;hall you get a firmer Ally than him? whom is it more un&s;eemely or di&s;hone&s;t not to love, than a brother? and whom in all the world is it more decent and befitting, to honour above the re&s;t than a brother? It is a brother onely, and none but he, &ocirc; <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> who if hee have the principall place of love with a brother, incurreth not the envie of others thereby? For the tender love therefore of our tutelar Gods, my children: As yee have any de&s;ire to gratifie mee your father, honour yee one another. For, yee doe not I trow beleeve and know for certaine, that when I end this hu|mane life, I &s;hall become nothing at all and have no more being. Neither did yee &s;o much as erewhile &s;ee my &s;oule vi&s;ibly, but by the operations which it had, yee conceived of it as of a reall e&s;&s;ence. Or know yee not yet, what ter|rours doe their &s;oules who have &s;uffred violence and wrongs &s;trike into murde|rers hearts, and what<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> temor&s;e and &s;ting of con|&s;cience.</NOTE> revengefull tormentors, they &s;end among the wicked? Thinke yee, that the honours done to tho&s;e that are departed, would have en|dured &s;o long, if their &s;pirits had no power and &s;trength remaining in them? For mine owne part, my &s;onnes, I could never be per&s;waded to beleeve, that the &s;oule all while it is contained within this mortall body &s;hould live, and after|wards die, when it is departed from it. For, this I &s;ee, that the &s;oule quicke|neth the&s;e mortall bodies, and giveth life to them, &s;o long as it remaineth therein. Neither could I ever be brought to thinke, that after the &s;oule is &s;e|parate from this blocki&s;h and &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;e body, it &s;hall be it &s;elfe void of &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding: But when the pure and &s;incere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or &s;oule.</NOTE> minde is once departed, then by all likelihood and rea&s;on, it is mo&s;t wi&s;e. After the di&s;&s;olution of a man, every thing is &s;eene to returne againe unto its owne kinde, &s;ave onely the &s;oule, which neither pre&s;ent nor ab&s;ent can be &s;eene.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider moreover, quoth he, that nothing in the world re&s;embleth mans death neerer than &s;leepe. But the &s;oule of a man whiles he &s;leepeth, &s;heweth mo&s;t of all her divinitie, yea and fore&s;eeth future things, being as it &s;eemeth, at &s;uch a time at greate&s;t libertie. Is it &s;o then, as I per&s;wade my &s;elfe it is? doth the &s;oule quit and for&s;ake the body? In all reverence and honour therefore un|to my &s;oule, performe that which I reque&s;t you to doe. But were it nothing &s;o, but that the &s;oule as it abideth in the body, &s;o it peri&s;heth with the &s;ame, yet feare yee the Gods who are immortall; who &s;ee all things and bee omni|potent, who maintaine and keepe this orderly cour&s;e of the whole world, &s;o <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="4 pages">
<PB N="213" REF="115">make a goodly &s;hew for number and multitude: but in the warres I a&s;&s;ure you there is no u&s;e of them at all. And that appeareth well enough by the events that en&s;ue thereof. For, yee &s;hall have enemies &s;ooner than friends conver&s;ant in their land. And verily, <HI>Cyrus</HI> when he tooke his hor&s;emen from among the light skirmi&s;hers a farre off, and furni&s;hed them with compleat armour and their hor&s;es likewi&s;e, giving every one of them a launce in his hand, brought in the clo&s;e fight at armes end. But now, neither doe they skirmi&s;h lightly and aloofe with the enemie any more, nor yet joyne and cope together: Semblably the footmen in the&s;e dayes have their light bucklers, their &s;hort courtell-axes and cimiters to &s;erve in the warres and to fight clo&s;e as they did in <HI>Cyrus</HI> his time: howbeit even the&s;e will not willingly &s;o much as come to buckle at handfight. Neither u&s;e they their hooked chariots in that &s;ort as they were ordained by <HI>Cy|rus.</HI> For he advancing and honouring his Chariotiers, made them good &s;ouldi|ers, and had them upon all occa&s;ions pre&s;t to a&s;&s;aile armed enemies. But the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in the&s;e dayes, knowing not what they be that are upon the &s;aid Chari|ots, thinke one as good as another, and tho&s;e that be unpracti&s;ed, able to equa|lize the trained. A certaine kind of on&s;et and charge they give, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, but before they come among the enemies, either they willingly drop out of their chariots, or el&s;e leap forth of purpo&s;e. Whereupon the Chariots and teemes both, being abandoned of their drivers and rulers, do many times much more hurt unto their friends, than to their enemies. Certes, they being privy to them&s;elves, and knowing well enough how &s;lenderly they be appointed for the warres, withdraw their heads out of the field: neither dare any of them pre|pare him&s;elfe to battaile, without aide of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> Nay, they know well enough that they mu&s;t have <HI>Greeks</HI> in their armie, when&s;oever they meane either to make warre one with another, or upon the <HI>Greeks</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thus have I performed, as I thinke, that which I purpo&s;ed and undertooke. For, I &s;ay and avow, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and their A&s;&s;ociats, are in the&s;e dayes more irreligious in the wor&s;hip of the Gods, more unkind and unnaturall to their kinsfolke, more unju&s;t to others, and for martiall affaires more effeminate than in former times. To conclude, if there be any man di&s;po&s;ed to hold up a &s;ide, and maintaine the contrary to this po&s;ition that I have &s;et downe, let him but con&s;ider their own deeds and actions, and he &s;hall find that they will te&s;tifie on my behalfe, and verifie my words in the end. <GAP DESC="foreign"> 8^0. <HI>Febr.</HI> 1620.
