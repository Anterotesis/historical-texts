<HEAD>Signes from Heaven, to warne and awaken the Ea&s;tern A&s;&s;ociation, with the Southerne parts of the Kingdome.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_INcredulity hath alwayes been the forerunner of mi&s;ery ever &s;ince the Creation; the old World would not be warned by</HI> Noah's <HI>building the Arke untill the flood came,</HI> Pharoah <HI>would not be warned by Gods Judgements till hee was &s;wal|lowed up of the</HI> Red-Sea; <HI>nay, as</HI> Abraham, <HI>&s;aid in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rable to</HI> Dives, <HI>&s;hould one ari&s;e from the dead yet would they not beleeve; therefore becau&s;e the&s;e warnings would not &s;erve; the Lord, who is &s;low to wrath and of much mercy, gave &s;ignes from Heaven unto the Iewes, to forewarn them of their approaching de&s;truction, but they regarded it not. The Blazing</HI> Star <HI>&s;een in our Horizon &s;o many yeares ago, which
<PB N="2" REF="3">began towards</HI> Germany, <HI>fetcht its compa&s;se to</HI> Ire|land, <HI>and who&s;e blazing bu&s;h taile hung over</HI> Eng|land, <HI>was but a nine dayes wonder, although the&s;e Countries hath &s;ince found the effects thereof, the Almighty divert his Iudgements from u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> if it be his will, which we may ju&s;tly feare hangeth over our heads, by rea&s;on of our continuall crying &s;innes, not|with&s;tanding the many tokens of his anger &s;hewed un|to us by &s;trange and fearfull Apparitions &s;een in the Ayre (the</HI> 21 <HI>of May la&s;t pa&s;t) in many parts, both in our own Kingdome of</HI> England, <HI>and at the</HI> Hague, <HI>in</HI> Holland, <HI>by many hundreds of beholders, which thus appeared unto them.</HI></P>
<P>VPon the one and twentieth day of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t in the afternoon, in this yeere 1646, there were very &s;trange &s;ights &s;een, and unwonted &s;ounds heard in the Ayre, in &s;everall places of this King|dome, as al&s;o at the <HI>Hague</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> upon the &s;ame day as followeth.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; came a little round thing about the big|ne&s;&s;e of a Table or bord, like unto gray Paper: and without it was &s;eene the likene&s;&s;e of a Lyon and a Dragon, which furiou&s;ly fought together, which Dragon after a while did &s;pit fire furiou&s;ly, but was overcome by the Lyon: and yet the Lion continued in &s;ight.</P>
<P N="2">2. Appeared by the Lyon a multitude of &s;oul|diers, with another Dragon likewi&s;e, with a multitude of Souldiers both foot and hor&s;e: and before every Troop a Trumpeter, which we &s;aw
<PB N="3" REF="3">perfectly &s;et the Trumpets to their mouths, and &s;o began the Troops to fight one again&s;t another in great fury: &s;o that we did not know who had the better, but the people vani&s;hed away, and the Ly|on and the Dragon continued &s;till in fight.</P>
<P N="3">3. There appeared al&s;o a King with three Crownes on his head, &s;itting upon a Kingly throne with a great company of people about his Throne, and they vani&s;hed away immediately: but the Ly|on and the Dragon aboad &s;till in fight.</P>
<P N="4">4. There appeared al&s;o a number of peoples head, and one great head among&s;t them: and a multitude of bodies without heads, which vani&s;h|ed away, yet the Lyon and the Dragon aboad as before continuing in fight.</P>
<P N="5">5. There appeared yet likewi&s;e one man &s;it|ting upon a hor&s;e, which &s;hot him&s;elf through (as with a pi&s;toll) and fell backward, and &s;o vani&s;h|ed away.</P>
<P>La&s;tly there appeared a mighty fleet of Ships in the South-we&s;t, and drove to the South-ea&s;t, by the Lyon and the Dragon, where the fight was, with a multitude of men aboord the &s;hips, with half their bodies to be &s;een above board, which we &s;aw perfectly hoyfing up their Sayles, and driving too and fro, and as it were continued all &s;tanding &s;till, till the Lyon and the Dragon embraced one another and &s;o fell backward, and di&s;appeared: whereupon there appeared a great cloud which was not there before, and &s;o drove away with the wind.</P>

<P>Betwixt <HI>Newmarket</HI> and <HI>Thetford</HI> in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> there was ob&s;erved a piller or a Cloud to a&s;cend from the earth, with the bright hilts of a &s;word towards the bottom of it, which piller did a&s;|cend in a pyramidall form, and fa&s;hioned it &s;elf in|to the form of a &s;pire broach Steeple, and there de|&s;cended al&s;o out of the skie, the form of a Pike or Lance, with a very &s;harp head or point to encoun|ter with it.</P>
<P>Al&s;o at a di&s;tance, there appeared another Spear or Lance, with a very accute point out of the Skie, likewi&s;e, which was ready to interpo&s;e, but did not engage it &s;elfe.</P>

<P>At <HI>Sopham</HI> in the County of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> a Ball
