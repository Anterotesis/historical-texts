<P><HI>O</HI> Eternal God our heavenly Father, who&s;e Name is the God of Ho&s;ts, who art the only giver of all Victory; We yield thee our hearty Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving for the late &s;ignal Deliverance, and glorious Succe&s;s thou ha&s;t vouch&s;afed to tho&s;e thy faithful Ser|vants, who have not been a&s;hamed to confe&s;s the Faith of Chri&s;t Crucified, but have man|fully fought under his Banner.

<HEAD>The Epi&s;tle. 1 S. John Chap. 4.1.</HEAD>
<P>BEloved, believe not every &s;pirit, but try the &s;pirits whether they are of God: becau&s;e many fal&s;e prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every &s;pirit that confe&s;&s;eth that Ie&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, is of God. And every &s;pirit that confe&s;|&s;eth not that Ie&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, is not of God: and this is that &s;pirit of anti|chri&s;t, whereof you have heard that it &s;hould come, and even now already is it in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have over|come them: becau&s;e greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world. They are of the world: therefore &s;peak they of the world, and the world heareth them. We are of God: he that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us. Hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the &s;pirit of errour. Be|loved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</P>

<P>ALmighty and everliving God, who art glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in prai&s;es, doing Wonders, who by miraculous Ways and Means, ha&s;t rai&s;ed thy Hou&s;hold, the Church, building it on the Foundation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Ie&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf be|ing the chief Corner Stone, who ha&s;t promi|&s;ed to be with it always even unto the end of the world, &s;o that the Gates of Hell &s;hall never be able to prevail again&s;t it; Who by &s;o many marvellous Acts of thy Providence ha&s;t graci|ou&s;ly made good this thy Promi&s;e in all Ages, particularly at this time did&s;t not give over thine Heritage to Confu&s;ion, but ha&s;t ble&s;&s;ed the Armies engaged in this Chri&s;tian War, crowning them with Victory and Honour. We meekly be&s;eech thee, O Lord, that we and the whole Chri&s;tian World may make a right u&s;e of the&s;e thy unde&s;erved Mercies. To this
<PB REF="3"> end we pray thee to keep and maintain all Chri&s;tian Kings, Princes and Governours, in Peace, Amity and Concord, that being &s;trengthned by thy Grace and Power, with uni|ted Hearts and Hands, in defence of thy Cau&s;e and Truth, they may wax valiant in Battle, &s;ee their de&s;ires on their Enemies, and put to flight the Armies of the Aliens. Pre&s;erve, O Lord, thy mo&s;t holy Faith in tho&s;e Kingdoms and Nations, where it is already planted, re|&s;tore it to its antient Purity and Brightne&s;s where it lies in ob&s;curity, oppre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tyranny, and their abominable Super&s;tition. Enlarge its Borders into all Lands, that all the Ends of the Earth may &s;ee the Salva|tion of Our God. Grant this O Lord, for the &s;ake of Our only Mediatour and Advocate Ie&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
