<HEAD>To His Grace His Majesties High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and the Right Honourable the E&s;tates of Parli|ament.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The humble <HI>PETITION</HI> of <HI>The Council-General of the Company of</HI> Scotland <HI>Trading to</HI> Africa <HI>and the</HI> Indies.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT whereas the Wi&s;dom of the KING, and this pre&s;ent <HI>Parliament,</HI> has thought fit by two &s;olemn &s;everal <HI>Acts,</HI> and Letters patent under the <HI>Great-Seal</HI> of this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h our COMPANY with &s;uch <HI>Powers, Priviledges</HI> and <HI>Immu|nities,</HI> as were thought needful to encourage any &s;uch new Undertaking in this Nation; And particularly to rai&s;e a Joynt-Stock in &s;uch manner as we &s;hould think fit. And for that End to enfranchi&s;e &s;uch Forraigners as would become Partners with us, &amp; to en|ter into Treaties of Commerce with any in Amity with His Maje&s;tie for that effect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Tho&s;e of our Number who were then intru&s;ted with the Management thereof did think it mo&s;t Na|tural to make the fir&s;t Offer of &s;haring our &s;aid Priviledges with our Countrey-Men, and other Neighbours in <HI>England,</HI> as living under the &s;ame Monarchy: And they not only readily embraced the Offer, but in nine Days time &s;ub&s;cribed 300000 <HI>lib. Serling,</HI> as the one half of the Capital-Stock then propo&s;ed, &amp; actually payed in the fir&s;t-fourth Part thereof, part in <HI>Specie,</HI> part in <HI>Bank-Notes,</HI> and the re&s;t in <HI>Notes</HI> payable upon demand.</P>
<P>That both Hou&s;es of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> taking Umbrage at tho&s;e Proceedings, did not only joyntly Addre&s;s His Maje&s;ty for fru&s;trating the ends of the &s;aid Act, but the Hou&s;e of Commons did al&s;o appoint a Committee to Examine what Methods were taken for obtaining the &s;aid Act of Parliament here, for e&s;tabli&s;hing our Company, who were the Sub&s;cribers thereto, and who were the Promoters and Advi&s;ers thereof, with power to &s;end for Per&s;ons, Papers and Records; pur&s;uant to which, the &s;aid Committee gave Or|ders to Summon not only the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sub&s;cribers, but even &s;ome Per&s;ons then Re&s;iding in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as by the &s;aid Addre&s;s, Votes of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and Copy of the &s;aid Summons may appear; By all which, together with &s;ome other mea&s;ures then taken, our Friends in <HI>England</HI> were, to our great lo&s;s, di&s;appointment, and retardment, forced to relinqui&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That notwith&s;tanding of that di&s;couragement, not only mo&s;t of the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and whole Body of the Royal Burrows, have upon the Inducement, and Pub|lick Faith of the &s;aid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent, Contributed as Adventurers, in rai&s;ing a far more con&s;iderable Joynt Stock, than any was ever before rai&s;ed in this King|dom for any Publick Undertaking, or Project of Trade what&s;oever, (which makes it now of &s;o much the more Univer&s;al a Concern to the Nation) but we have al&s;o had all the Pro|mi&s;ing Hopes of Forreign Aid, that our Hearts could wi&s;h, e&s;pecially at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> where the Merchants of that City entred into Contract with our Deputees, to joyn at lea&s;t 200000 <HI>lib. Sterling</HI> with us, till, to our great Surpri&s;e and Lo&s;s, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters there, did, under Pretence of Special Warrant from His Maje&s;ty, put a Stop thereto, by giving in a Me|morial to the Senate of that City, Threatning both Senate and Inhabitants, with the King's outmo&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure, if they &s;hould Countenance, or Joyn with us in any Treaty of Trade, or Commerce, as by the annexed Copies thereof, in <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> may ap|pear, which Memorial, we humbly pray, may, for the better Information of Your Grace, and Right Honourable E&s;tates, be al&s;o Read in Parliament.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>That after the &s;aid Memorial was by the Senate tran&s;mitted to the Commercij or Body of Merchants of that City, they to a&s;&s;ert their own Freedom, did advi&s;e and prevail upon our Deputees and Agents who were there for the time, to open Books in the &s;aid Mer|chant's Hall, where for &s;ome Days they &s;igned con&s;iderable Sums pur&s;uant to their &s;aid Contract, tho' under Condition to be void, if we &s;hould not procure &s;ome Declaration from the King that might render them &s;ecure from the Threatnings and other In&s;inuations contained in the &s;aid Memorial: And to our great di&s;appointment, thus the Ca&s;e &s;tands in Su&s;pen&s;e between them and us to this Day.</P>
<P>That as the rea&s;onable (nay and unque&s;tionable) Pro&s;pect which we had of a pow|erfull A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and &s;everal other Places (if not ob&s;tructed as afore&s;aid) induced us to propo&s;e a far greater Equipage at fir&s;t than otherwi&s;e we would have done; So the rendring of tho&s;e Mea&s;ures <HI>abortive,</HI> has not only weaken'd our Stock, le&s;&s;ened our Credit, retarded our fir&s;t Expedition, and di&s;heartned many of our Partners at Home, but even al&s;o &s;hackled our Re&s;olutions and Power from pro&s;ecuting at Pre&s;ent &s;everal o|ther Branches of Forreign and Dome&s;tick Trades and Improvements which we had in View, if we had not met with &s;uch Ob&s;tructions and Di&s;couragements from Time to Time.</P>
<P>That tho' our Company is more immediatly and &s;en&s;ibly touched in many Re&s;pects by &s;uch Proceedings, than any other; Yet we humbly conceiving al&s;o, that the Honour and Independency of the Nation, as well as the Authority and Credit of the Parliament is &s;truck at through our &s;ides; We could not as Countrey men, and in Duty to that Col|lective Power, which gave our Company fir&s;t a Being, but inform His Grace <HI>His Ma|je&s;ties High Commi&s;&s;ioner,</HI> and Right Honourable the <HI>Estates of Parliament</HI> of the Premi&s;&s;es, to the End, that the <HI>Great Council</HI> of the Nation, now a&s;&s;embled (whom GOD Al|mighty Direct) may do therein as to them in their profound Wi&s;dom and Di&s;cretion, &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P>That as to what thereof concerns our Company in particular, we &s;hall humbly beg leave to Sugge&s;t further, that our Ships being now at Sea, on their intented Voyage, the former Treatment which our Company met with in <HI>England</HI> and el&s;e where, may give us too ju&s;t grounds to &s;u&s;pect, that if either through multiplicity of publick Affairs, or otherwi&s;e how|&s;oever; <HI>Your Grace</HI> and Right Honourable <HI>E&s;tates</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> &s;hould neglect the taking pre&s;ent Notice of &s;uch U&s;age, the Enemies of our Company would be thereby en|couraged, either directly or indirectly to pur&s;ue their former de&s;igns of Ruining (if po&s;&s;ible all our Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P><HI>May it therefore plea&s;e</HI> your Grace, <HI>and the</HI> Right Honourable the E&s;tates of Parliamenr, <HI>to take the Premi&s;&s;es into your most &s;erious Con&s;ideration, to vindicat our</HI> Company's <HI>Reputation Abroad, by &s;upporting the Credit of the Acts of</HI> Parliament, <HI>and Letters patent, by which the &s;ame is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and wherein the Honour of the</HI> Nation <HI>is &s;o much concerned, to take effectual Mea&s;ures (as the &s;aid Act provides) for re|pairing the great Lo&s;s and Dammages, which we have already &s;u&s;tained, through the unwarrantable Treatment above-mentioned, as well as for preventing the like for the fu|ture; and withal to continue to us the Priviledges and Exemptions mentioned in the &s;aid Acts of Parliament, and Letters patent for &s;ome longer time, in con&s;ideration of the time already elap&s;ed without Execution, and our Stock lying dead without Improvement, by rea&s;on of the Ob&s;tructions afore&s;aid.</HI></P>
