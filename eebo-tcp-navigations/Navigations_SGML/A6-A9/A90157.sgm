<HEAD>Oneals E&s;cape out of the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e times, I beleeve are not unacquainted with the &s;ini&s;ter di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Oneal,</HI> who for his wicked intentions in the la&s;t expedi|tion in the North was committed by the Hou&s;e of Parliament to the Gate-Hou&s;e, and afterwards hee was by the &s;ame power committed to the Tower, where he hath remained ever &s;ince. And upon the 4 of this pre&s;ent May, as one guilty of the Allegations again&s;t him, hee made his e&s;cape both from his pri|&s;on, and the pre&s;ent Iu&s;tice of the Law. The manner of his e&s;cape is after a very diver&s;e manner &s;uppo&s;ed, and judged; &s;ome &s;u&s;pecting his E&s;cape to be made in the di&s;gui&s;e of a Porters Frock, wherby hee did delude his Keepers apprehen&s;ion; othets &s;u&s;pecting his e&s;cape to be made over the walls, either by the help of a Roap, or el&s;e by &s;ome other in&s;trument, which the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his pre&s;ent Fears or friends, did provide for him.</P>
<P>This Pri&s;oner being for &s;ome &s;pace not &s;een as before in publique, a great Iealou&s;ie immediately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Keepers brea&s;t; whereupon fearing that he might be &s;uddenly taken with &s;ome extream
<PB REF="3"> melady, which might occa&s;ion his &s;tay in his cham|ber, the Lieutenant and other Officers immediatly went to his Chamber, &s;u&s;pecting, and fearing him to be dead; but upon their &s;earch, they found neither their pri&s;oner, nor almo&s;t any thing in his Chamber, for between him and his boy, they had conveyed a|way from his bed one pair of &s;heets, one Table-Cloath, and one long Towell, which did confirm their former feats of his E&s;cape. And now finding to be true, what they before but &s;u&s;pected, the Lieu|tenant for his own &s;ecurity, gave pre&s;ent informati|on of his e&s;cape unto the Parliament, who no &s;oo|ner received the News of his E&s;cape, but wi&s;ely con&s;idering the dangers that might en&s;ue the liber|ty of &s;uch an ill and di&s;affected Member, gave pre|&s;ent Order for his apprehen&s;ion, and gave Power and Commi&s;sion unto the &s;aid Lieutenant of the Tower, to i&s;&s;ue forth Warrants for his &s;peedy Ap|prehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Allegations again&s;t him, which occa&s;ioned his impri&s;onment, I have briefly and faithfully &s;et down.</P>
