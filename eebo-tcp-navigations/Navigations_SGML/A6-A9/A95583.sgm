<HEAD>A Short Relation of a Long Iourny, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<L>A Traveller that loves to &s;ee &s;trange Lands,</L>
<L>May be a man or not a man of 's hands:</L>
<L>But yet 'tis very requi&s;ite and meet,</L>
<L>He &s;hould be furni&s;h'd with good brains and feet;</L>
<L>For he that wants legs, feet, and brains, and wit,</L>
<L>To be a Traveller is mo&s;t unfit:</L>
<L>And &s;uch am I by Age of &s;trength bereft,</L>
<L>With one right leg, and one lame left leg left.</L>
<L>Beggers on their backs their brats do reare;</L>
<L>But I my i&s;&s;ue in my leg do beare:</L>
<L>I dre&s;&s;e it often and impatiently</L>
<L>It lies and cries not, though it make me cry;</L>
<L>Yet I dare challenge Scotti&s;h <HI>Jock</HI> or <HI>Jackey,</HI></L>
<L>Or any light-heel'd nimble footed Lackey,</L>
<L>To travell &s;uch a Jaunt as I have done,</L>
<L>With th' right leg going, and the left leg run:</L>
<L>Or if I plea&s;e, the ca&s;e I'le alter &s;o,</L>
<L>To make the wor&s;t leg run, the be&s;t to goe.</L>
<L>And &s;ure my heart was &s;tout, men may &s;uppo&s;e,</L>
<L>To venture Travell with &s;uch legs as tho&s;e.</L>
<L>But there be &s;ome few that do under&s;tand,</L>
<L>'Tis merry walking with a hor&s;e in hand.</L>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<L>Such was my Lot, I had a &s;tately Cour&s;er,</L>
<L>None cour&s;er quality'd, and for a wor&s;er,</L>
<L>There's neither <HI>Halifax,</HI> or <HI>Hull,</HI> nor <HI>Hell,</HI></L>
<L>That for good parts my hor&s;e can parallel;</L>
<L>He was a bea&s;t, had heated been and cheated,</L>
<L>Too much hard over rid and under meated,</L>
<L>That he as gaunt as any Greyhound was,</L>
<L>And for a Hor&s;es Skelliton might pa&s;&s;e:</L>
<L>You might have told his ribs, he was &s;o thin,</L>
<L>And &s;een his heart and guts, but for his skin;</L>
<L>He was not pur&s;ie foggy, cloy'd with greace,</L>
<L>And like his Rider lov'd re&s;t, ea&s;e, and peace:</L>
<L><HI>Dun</HI> was, and is the Dumb bea&s;t, and was Done,</L>
<L>E're I begun, or he with me begun.</L>
<L>He had a black Li&s;t, from the Mane to Taile,</L>
<L>Which is a colour that doth &s;eldome faile:</L>
<L>To change of paces he had been inur'd,</L>
<L>But yet not one t'endure, or be endur'd;</L>
<L>His Trot would fling a Dagger out ot'h &s;heath,</L>
<L>Or jolt a man to death, or out of breath.</L>
<L>His Ambling was invi&s;ible to me,</L>
<L>From &s;uch &s;mooth ea&s;ie garbs his feet were free:</L>
<L>His common Pace in Sun-&s;hine or in &s;howre,</L>
<L>Was (as he pleas'd) about two mile an houre.</L>
<L>I never yet could put him in a &s;weat,</L>
<L>For he was never free, but at his meat.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>John</HI> upon <HI>Dun's</HI> back, were both <HI>Dun John,</HI></L>
<L>And thus the tedious way we wandred on.</L>
<L>Now to proceed in order duly, truly,</L>
<L>I <HI>London</HI> left the thirteenth day of <HI>July:</HI></L>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<L>The Wayes as faire as man could well de&s;ire,</L>

<L>There my acquaintance, of good fame and worth,</L>
<L>Did welcome me: the next day I &s;et forth,</L>
<L>With Boots, <HI>Sans</HI> Spurs, with Whip, and Switch of Burch,</L>
<L>I got on, twenty miles to <HI>Stoken</HI> Church:</L>
<L>The fifteenth day, S. <HI>Swithin,</HI> I and <HI>Dun,</HI></L>
<L>Did &s;huffle &s;ixteen miles to <HI>Abington;</HI></L>
<L>There till the Tue&s;day following I abode,</L>
<L>From thence I &s;ixteen miles to great <HI>Tue</HI> rode,</L>
<L>There at the <HI>Swan</HI> mine Ho&s;t was free and kind,</L>
<L>He had but one eye, tother &s;ide was blinde;</L>
<L>But &s;urely he a right Good-fellow was,</L>
<L>And there one night my <HI>Dun</HI> did eat good gra&s;s.</L>
<L>On <HI>July's</HI> twenty one from <HI>Tue</HI> I went,</L>

<L>And for your love to me, good Ma&s;ter <HI>Venner,</HI></L>
<L>With humble thanks I am your prai&s;es Penner.</L>
<L>My gratitude to Ma&s;ter <HI>Jacob Harmer,</HI></L>
<L>His Drapers &s;hop could never make me warmer,</L>
<L>Then high and mighty <HI>Warwick's</HI> drink did there,</L>
<L>It made my brains to Caper and careere,</L>
<L>It was of &s;uch invincible &s;trong force,</L>
<L>To knock me (in five miles) twice from my Hor&s;e:</L>
<L>And &s;ure I think the Drink was certainly</L>
<L>Infu&s;ed with the conqu'ring gho&s;t of <HI>Guy.</HI></L>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<L>On <HI>July's</HI> two and twentieth day I came</L>

<L>He's nobly minded as a Baronet;</L>
<L>Foure dayes they kept me with exceeding cheere,</L>

<L>'Tis a dry City, and dry let it be,</L>
<L>'Twas not made dryer one &s;mall drop for me:</L>
<L>Like a Camelion there I brake my fa&s;t,</L>
<L>And thence I twenty miles to <HI>Lichfield</HI> pa&s;t;</L>
<L>There at the <HI>George</HI> I took my lodging up,</L>
<L>I well was lodg'd, and well did &s;up and cup,</L>
<L>When there by chance, I ca&s;t my wandring eyon</L>

<L>On <HI>July's</HI> twenty &s;eventh I rode alone</L>

<L>Next day to <HI>Nantwich</HI> &s;ixteen long miles more,</L>

<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P>MY Lodging at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> was in the Watergate &s;treet, at the Sign of the Feathers, I lay on a Feather-bed, and in the &s;ame hou&s;e I met with two Brothers of mine acquaintance thirty years, they brought me to the Chamber of a Reverend <HI>Italian</HI> Phy&s;ition, named <HI>Vincent Lancelles</HI> he was more then 80 yeares of Age, yet of a very able body, and vigorous con&s;titution: The Yong mens Names were <HI>Thomas Morrine</HI> and <HI>Francis Morrine,</HI> the people were plea&s;ed (out of their Ignorance, or in &s;mall Wit) to call the old Gen|tleman a Mountebank; but I am &s;ure he was de&s;ervedly well reputed and reported of, for ma|ny Malladies and Di&s;ea&s;es which hee cured, whereof divers were judged incurable: He help|ed &s;uch as were grieved for three &s;everall con&s;i|derations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Hee cured the Rich, for as much as hee could get.</P>
<P>Secondly, Hee healed the Meaner &s;ort for what they could &s;pare, or were willing to part withall.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Hee cured the Poor for Gods &s;ake, and gave them mony and other reliefe, as I my &s;elfe (with thankfull experience) mu&s;t ever ac|knowledge: For he looked upon my lame leg, and applyed &s;uch Medicine, as did not only ea&s;e me, but I am in hope will cure me, the griefe be|ing nothing but a Bla&s;t of Lightning and Thun|der, or Planet &s;troke, which I received nine years <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
<P>For a further courte&s;ie, when I was taking my leave of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> I demanded what I had to pay for Lodging, Dyet, and Hor&s;e-meat, mine Ho&s;t &s;ayd, that all was fully payd and &s;atisfied by the Good old Phy&s;ition. My humble thanks remembred to Captain <HI>Vincent Corbet,</HI> but more e&s;pecially to Captain <HI>John Whitworth</HI> at <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>On Fryday the 30. of <HI>July,</HI> I rode (and footed it) ten Miles to <HI>Flint</HI> (which is the Shire Town of Flint-&s;hire) and &s;urely War hath made it mi|&s;erable, the &s;ometimes famous Ca&s;tle there, in which <HI>Richard</HI> the Second of that Name, King of <HI>England</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed by <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bullinbrook,</HI> is now almo&s;t buried in it's own Ruins, and the Town is &s;o &s;poiled, that it may truely be &s;aid of it, that they never had any Market (in the me|mory of man) they have no Sadler, Taylor, Weaver, Brewer, Baker, Botcher, or Button|maker; they have not &s;o much as a &s;igne of an Ale-hou&s;e, &s;o that I was doubtfull of a Lodging, but (by good hap) I hapned into the hou&s;e of one Mr. <HI>Edward Griffith,</HI> where I had good meat and lodging for me and my dumb <HI>Dun</HI> Bea&s;t, for very rea&s;onable con&s;ideration, and this (me thinks) is a pitifull di&s;cription of a Shire Town.</P>
<P>Saturday, the la&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> I left <HI>Flint,</HI> and went three miles to <HI>Holy-well,</HI> of which place I mu&s;t &s;peak &s;omewhat materially: About the length of a furlong, down a very &s;teep Hill, is a Well (full of wonder and admiration) it comes
<PB N="11" REF="6">from a Spring not far from <HI>Rudland</HI> Ca&s;tle; it is and hath been many hundred yeares knowne by the name of <HI>Holy-Well,</HI> but it is more common|ly and of mo&s;t Antiquity called Saint <HI>Winifrids</HI> Well, in memory of the pious and cha&s;te Virgin <HI>Winifrid,</HI> who was there beheaded for refu&s;ing to yield her Cha&s;tity to the furious lu&s;t of a Pagan Prince; in that very place where her bloud was &s;hed, this Spring &s;prang up; from it doth i&s;&s;ue &s;o forceible a &s;tream, that within a hundred yards of it, it drives certain Mils, and &s;ome do &s;ay that nine Corn Mils and Fulling Mils are driven with the &s;tream of that Spring: It hath a fair Chap|pell erected over it called Saint <HI>Winifrids</HI> Chap|pell, which is now much defaced by the injury of the&s;e late Wars: The well is compa&s;&s;ed a|bout with a fine Wall of Free &s;tone, the Wall hath eight Angles or Corners, and at every An|gle is a fair Stone Piller, whereon the We&s;t end of the Chappell is &s;upported. In two &s;everall places of the Wall, there are neat &s;tone &s;taires to go into the water that comes from the Well, for it is to be noted that the Well it &s;elfe doth continually work and bubble with extream vio|lence, like a boiling Cauldron or Furnace, and within the Wall, or into the Well very few do enter: The Water is Chri&s;talline, &s;weet, and medicinable, it is frequented daily by many peo|ple of Rich and Poore, of all Di&s;ca&s;es, among&s;t which great &s;tore of folkes are cured, divers are
<PB N="12" REF="7">ca&s;ed, but none made the wor&s;e. The Hill de&s;|cending is plentifully furni&s;hed (on both &s;ides of the way) with Beggers of all ages, &s;exes, condi|tions, &s;orts and &s;izes, many of them are impo|tent, but all are impudent, and richly embrode|red all over with &s;uch Hexameter poudred <HI>Er|mins</HI> (or Vermin) as are called Lice in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Monday, the &s;econd of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the Day begun, I mounted my <HI>Dun,</HI> having hired a little Boy (to direct me in the way) that could &s;peak no Engli&s;h, and for lack of an Interpreter, we travelled &s;peachle&s;s eight miles, to <HI>Rudland,</HI> where is an old ruined winde and war-&s;haken Ca&s;tle; from that Town, after my Hor&s;e, and the Boy, and my &s;elfe had dined with Hay, Oats, and <HI>Barraw Cau&s;s,</HI> we hors't and footed it twelve miles further, to a fine &s;trong walled Towne, named <HI>Aberconwy;</HI> there I lodged at the hou&s;e of one Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> (an Engli&s;h man) he is Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter there, and there my entertainment was good, and my Reckoning rea&s;onable: There is a good defen&s;ive Ca&s;tle which I would have &s;een, but becau&s;e there was a Garri&s;on, I was loath to give occa&s;ion of offence, or be much inqui&s;i|tive.</P>
<Q><L>The next day when the Clock &s;trook two and fowre,</L>
<L>I mounted <HI>Dun, Dun</HI> mounted <HI>Penmen Mawre;</HI></L>
<L>And if I do not take my aime ami&s;&s;e,</L>
<L>That lofty Mountain &s;eems the Skies to ki&s;&s;e:</L>
<PB N="13" REF="7">
<L>But there are other Hils accounted higher,</L>
<L>Who&s;e lofty tops I had no mind t' a&s;pire:</L>
<L>As <HI>Snowdon,</HI> and the tall <HI>Plinnillimon,</HI></L>
<L>Which I no &s;tomack had to tread upon.</L>
<L><HI>Merioneth</HI> Mountains, and Shire <HI>Cardigan</HI></L>
<L>To travell over, will tire hor&s;e and man:</L>
<L>I, to <HI>Bewmaris</HI> came that day and din'd,</L>
<L>Where I the good Lord <HI>Buckley,</HI> thought to find.</L>
<L>But he to &s;peak with me had no intent,</L>
<L>Dry I came into's hou&s;e, dry out I went.</L>
<L>I left <HI>Bewmaris,</HI> and to <HI>Bangor</HI> trac'd it,</L>
<L>Ther's a brave Church, but Time and War defac'd it:</L>
<L>For Love and Mony I was welcome thither,</L>
<L>'Tis merry meeting when they come together.</L></Q>
<P>Thus having travelled from <HI>Aberconwy</HI> to <HI>Beu|morris</HI> and to <HI>Bangor,</HI> Tue&s;day 3. <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which in all they are plea&s;ed to call 14 miles, but mo&s;t of the Wel&s;h miles are large <HI>London</HI> mea&s;ure, not any one of them but hath a hand bredth or &s;mall cantle at each end, by which means, what they want in broadne&s;s, they have it in length; be&s;ides the a&s;cending and de&s;cending almo&s;t im|pa&s;&s;able mountains, and Break-neck &s;tony ways, doth make &s;uch Travellers as my &s;elfe, judge that they were no Mi&s;ers in mea&s;uring their miles; be&s;ides, the land is cour&s;er then it is in mo&s;t parts about <HI>London,</HI> which makes them to afford the larger mea&s;ure: for cour&s;e Broad|cloath is not at the rate of Velvet or Satten.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="8">
<P>Wedne&s;day the 4. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> I rode 8 miles from <HI>Bangor</HI> to <HI>Carnarvan,</HI> where I thought to have &s;een a Town and a Ca&s;tle, or a Ca&s;tle and a Town; but I &s;aw both to be one, and one to be both; for indeed a man can hardly divide them in judgement or apprehen&s;ion; and I have &s;een many gallant Fabricks and Fortifications, but for compactne&s;s and compleatne&s;s of <HI>Caer|narvon,</HI> I never yet &s;aw a parallell. And it is by Art and Nature &s;o &s;ited and &s;eated, that it &s;tands impregnable, &amp; if it be well mand, victu|alled, and ammunitioned, it is invincible, except fraud or famine do a&s;&s;ault, or con&s;pire again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I was 5. hours in <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> and when I thought that I had taken my leave for ever of it, then was I meerly deceived; for when I was a mile on my way, a Trooper came galloping af|ter me, and enforced me back to be examined by Colonell <HI>Thomas Ma&s;on,</HI> (the Governour there) who after a few words, when hee heard my name, and knew my occa&s;ions, he u&s;ed me &s;o re|&s;pectively and bountifully, that (at his charge) I &s;tayd all night, and by the means of him, and one Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> (a Ju&s;tice of Peace there) I was furni&s;hed with a Guide, and &s;omething el&s;e to bear charges for one weeks travaile; for which curte&s;ies, if I were not thankfull, I were worth the hanging for being ingratefull.</P>
<P>The 5. of Augu&s;t I went 12. miles, to a place
<PB N="15" REF="8">called <HI>Climenie,</HI> where the Noble Sure <HI>John Owen</HI> did, with liberall welcome, entertain me.</P>
<P>The 6. day I rode to a Town called <HI>Harleck,</HI> which &s;tands on a high barren Mountaine, very unea&s;ie for the a&s;cending into, by rea&s;on of the &s;teep and uneeven &s;tony way; this Town had neither hay, gra&s;s, oats, or any relief for a hor&s;e: there &s;tands a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, but the Town is all &s;poild, and almo&s;t inhabitable by the late la|mentable troubles.</P>
<P>So I left that Towne (for fear of &s;tarving my Hor&s;e) and came to a place called <HI>Bermoth,</HI> (12. miles that day, as narrow as 20.) That place was &s;o plentifully furni&s;hed with want of provi|&s;ion, that it was able to fami&s;h 100. men and hor&s;es: I procured a brace of Boyes to goe two miles to cut gra&s;&s;e for my <HI>Dun,</HI> for which I gave them two groats; for my &s;elfe and Guide, I pur|cha&s;ed a Hen boyld with Bacon, as yellow as the Cow&s;lip, or Gold Noble. My cour&s;e Lodging there, was at the homely Hou&s;e of one <HI>John Thom&s;on,</HI> a Lanca&s;hire Engli&s;h man.</P>
<P>Saturday the 7. of Augu&s;t, I Hor&s;t, footed, (and crawling upon all 4.) 10. &s;lender miles to <HI>Aberdovy,</HI> which was the la&s;t lodging that I had in Merioneth&s;hire, where was the be&s;t en|tertainment for men, but almo&s;t as bad as the wor&s;t for hor&s;es in all <HI>Merioneth&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>Augu&s;t 9. I gat into <HI>Cardigan&s;hire,</HI> to a mi&s;e|rable Market Town called <HI>Aberi&s;twith,</HI> where,
<PB N="16" REF="9">before the late troubles, there &s;tood a &s;trong Ca|&s;tle, which being blown up, fell down, and ma|ny fair Hou&s;es (with a defen&s;ible thick Wall a|bout the Town) are transformed into confu&s;ed heaps of unnece&s;&s;ary Rubbidge: within foure miles of this Town, are the &s;ilver Mines, which were honorable and profitable, as long as my good friend <HI>Thomas Bu&s;hell</HI> E&s;quire, had the ma|naging of them, who was mo&s;t indu&s;trious in the work, and withall by his noble demeanour, and affable deportment, de&s;ervedly gain'd the generall love and affection of all the Countrey, of all degrees of people: but &s;ince he hath left that important imployment, the Mines are neg|lected.</P>
<P>From <HI>Aberi&s;twith,</HI> I went to the Hou&s;e of Sir <HI>Richard Price,</HI> Knight and Baronet, where my entertainment was freely welcome, with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ion of further curte&s;ies at my departure, for which I humbly thank the noble Knight, not forgetting my gratefull remembrance to Mr. <HI>Thomas Evans</HI> there: that whole dayes journey being 9. miles.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day the 10. of Augu&s;t, having hired a Guide, for I that knew neither the intricate wayes, nor could &s;peake any of the Language, was nece&s;&s;itated to have Guides from place to place, and it being Harve&s;t time, I was forced to pay exceeding deare for Guiding; &s;o that &s;ome dayes I payd 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> &s;ometimes 3. be&s;ides bearing
<PB N="17" REF="9">their charges of meat and drinke and lodging; for it is to bee under&s;tood that tho&s;e kind of la|bouring people had rather reap hard all the day for &s;ix pence, then to go ten or twelve miles ea&s;i|ly on foot for two &s;hillings. That day, after &s;ix|teen miles travell, I came to the hou&s;e of an ancient worthy and ho&s;pitable Gentleman, na|med <HI>Sure Walter Lloyd,</HI> he was noble in bountifull hou&s;e-keeping, and in his genero&s;itie, cau&s;ed his hor&s;e to be &s;addled, and the next day hee rode three miles to <HI>Conway,</HI> and &s;hewd me the way to <HI>Caermarden,</HI> which they do call 18 &s;mall miles, but I had rather ride 30 of &s;uch miles as are in many parts of <HI>England;</HI> the way continu|ally hilly, or mountainous and &s;tony, in&s;omuch that I was forced to alight and walke 30 times, and when the Sun was near &s;etting, I having foure long miles to go, and knew no part of the way, was re&s;olved to take my lodging in a Reeke of Oats in the field, to which purpo&s;e, as I rode out of the &s;tony way towards my field-chamber, my Hor&s;e and I found a &s;ofter bed, for we were both in a Bog, or Quagmire, and at that time I had much ado to draw my&s;elfe out of the dirt, or my poore weary <HI>Dun</HI> out if the Mire.</P>
<P>I being in this hard &s;trait, having night (of Gods &s;ending,) Owl-light to guide me, no tongue to aske a que&s;tion, the way unknown, or uneven; I held it my be&s;t cour&s;e to grope in the hard &s;to|ny way againe, which having found, (after a
<PB N="18" REF="10">quarter of an houres melancholy paces) a Hor&s;|man of <HI>Wales,</HI> that could &s;peak Engli&s;h, overtook me and brought me to <HI>Caermarden,</HI> where I found good and free entertainment at the hou&s;e of one Mi&s;tris <HI>Oakley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caermarden,</HI> the &s;hire Town of <HI>Caermarden&s;hire,</HI> is a good large Town, with a defencible &s;trong Ca&s;tle, and a rea&s;onable Haven for &s;mall Barks and Boats, which formerly was for the u&s;e of good Ships, but now it is much impedimented with Shelvs, Sands, and other annoyances: It is &s;aid that <HI>Merlyn</HI> the Prophet was born there; it is one of the plentifulle&s;t Townes that ever I &s;et foot in, for very fair Egs are cheaper then &s;mall Pears; for, as near as I can remember, I will &s;et down at what rates victuals was there.</P>
<P>Butter, as good as the world affords, two pence halfe penny, or three pence the pound.</P>
<P>A Salmon two foot and a halfe long, twelve pence.</P>
<P>Biefe, three halfe pence the pound.</P>
<P>Oy&s;ters, a penny the hundred.</P>

<P>Peares, &s;ix for a penny.</P>
<P>And all manner of Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h at &s;uch low prices, that a little money will buy much, for there is nothing &s;carce, dear, or hard to come by, but Tobacco pipes.</P>

<P>The goodly Church of S. <HI>Davids</HI> hath beene

<PB N="21" REF="11">and into <HI>Glomorgan&s;hire;</HI> the &s;tory was, as near as I can remember, as followeth:</P>
<P>That on Saturday the 17. of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, 1652. there fell a &s;udden &s;howre of rain in the Coun|ties afore&s;aid, as if an Ocean had flowed from the Clouds to overwhelm and drown the moun|tains, it poured down with &s;uch violent impe|tuo&s;itie, that it tumbled down divers hou&s;es of &s;tone that &s;tood in the way of it; it drowned many Cattell and Sheep, bore all before it as it ran, therefore a poore man with his &s;on and daughter for&s;ook their hou&s;e, and the father and &s;on climed up into a tree for their &s;afety, in the mean time the mercile&s;s waters took hold of the poore maid, and mo&s;t furiou&s;ly bare her away, down betwen two mountains, rolling and hurling her again&s;t many great &s;tones, till at la&s;t it threw her near the &s;ide of the &s;tream, and her hair and hair-lace being loo&s;e, it catched hold of a &s;tump of an old thorn bu&s;h, by which means &s;he was &s;tayed, being almo&s;t dead; but as &s;he lay in this mi&s;ery, &s;he &s;aw a &s;ad and la|mentable &s;ight, for the water had fiercely un|rooted the tree, and bore it down the &s;treame, with her father and brother, who were both un|fortunately drowned: the Maid, as I was cer|tified, is like to live and recover.</P>

<P>The 18. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> I hired a Guide who brought me to <HI>Swan&s;ey</HI> (16 well &s;tretch'd Welch Mountainous Miles) where I was cordially welcome to an Ancient Worthy Gentleman, <HI>Waker Thomas</HI> E&s;quire, for who&s;e Love and Li|berality I am much obliged to him and the good Gentlewoman his Wife; he &s;taid me till the next day after Diner, and then &s;ent his man with me a mile to his Sons hou&s;e, named <HI>William Tho|mas</HI> E&s;quire: There, as &s;oone as I had rewar|ded my Guide he &s;lip'd from me, leaving me to the mercy of the Hou&s;e, where I found neither mercy nor manners; for the good Gentleman and his Wife were both rode from home; and though there were people old enough, and big enough, yet there was not one kind enough, or good enough to do me the lea&s;t kind of courte|&s;ie or friend&s;hip; they did not &s;o much as bid me come into the hou&s;e, or offer me a cup of drink; they all &s;cornfully wondred at me, like &s;o ma|ny Buzzards and Woodcocks about an Owle, there was a &s;hotten thin &s;cul'd &s;hallow brain'd &s;impleton fellow, that an&s;wered me, that he was a &s;tranger there, but I believed him not, by rea|&s;on of his familiarity with the re&s;t of the folks,
<PB N="23" REF="12">there was al&s;o a &s;ingle-&s;oal'd Gentlewoman, of the la&s;t Edition, who would vouch&s;afe me not one poor glance of her eye-beams, to whom I &s;aid as followeth.</P>
<P>Fair Gentlewoman, I was &s;ent hither by the Father of the Gentleman of this Hou&s;e, to whom I have a Letter from a Gentleman of his fami|liar acquaintance; I am &s;ure that the Owner of this Place is famed and reported to be a man en|dowed with all affability and courte&s;ie to &s;tran|gers as is every way accommodating to a Gen|tleman of Worth and Quality; and that if I were but a meer &s;tranger to him, yet his Gene|ro&s;ity would not &s;uffer me to be harbourle&s;s, but by rea&s;on of his Fathers &s;ending his &s;ervant with me, and a Friends Letter, I &s;ayd that if Mr. <HI>Tho|mas</HI> had been at home I &s;hould be better enter|tained.</P>
<P>To which Mrs. <HI>Pumpkins</HI> looking &s;cornfully, a&s;cue over her &s;houlders, an&s;wered me with <HI>(it may be &s;o)</HI> then mo&s;t uncurteous Mi&s;tris, quoth I, I doubt I mu&s;t bee nece&s;&s;itated to take up my lodging in the Field: To which the &s;aid ungen|tle Gentlewoman (with her po&s;teriors, or butt end towards me) gave me a finall An&s;wer, that I might if I would.</P>
<P>Whereupon I was enraged and mounted my <HI>Dun,</HI> and in a friendly maner I tooke my leave, &s;aying, that I would wander further and try my fortune, and that if my &s;tay at that hou&s;e, that

<P>Thus de&s;perately I &s;haked them off, that would not take me on, and riding I knew not whither, with a wide wild Heath under me, and a wider Firmament above me. I roade at ad|venture, betwixt light and darkne&s;s, about a mile, when luckily a Gentleman overtook mee, and after a little talk of my di&s;tre&s;&s;e and travail, he bad me be of good chear, for he would bring me to a lodging and entertainment; in which promi&s;e he was better then his word, for hee brought mee to a pretty Market Towne called <HI>Neath,</HI> where he &s;pent his money upon me; for which kindne&s;s I thank him. But one Doctour (as they call him) <HI>Rice Jones,</HI> (or Doctor <HI>Merri|man</HI>) came and &s;upt with mee, and very kindly payd all the reckoning.

<P><HI>_CARADOC</HI> of <HI>Lancarvan,</HI> (a &s;tudious Antiquary, and a learned diligent Collector of the Succe&s;&s;ions and Acts of the Britti&s;h Princes) did write the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Wales,</HI> from the time and Raigne of <HI>Cadwallador,</HI> who lived in the yeare of our Re|demption, 685, and continued the &s;aid Chrono|logy near 500 years, till the Raigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd King of <HI>England.</HI> It hath alwayes before tho&s;e times, and ever &s;ince, that Writers for feare, or flattery, or profit, have u&s;ed &s;hamefull (or &s;hamele&s;s) partiality, in publi&s;hing the fames of their owne Princes, and Countrey, above mea&s;ure, and beyond truth; but in their detra|cting and traducing others, they have been too liberall; and in relating their Valour, Vertues, or Injuries of &s;uch they fancyed not, they have been too &s;paring, or wilfully negligent.</P>
<P>But to make bold and &s;peak the truth, it is
<PB N="30" REF="16">worth good con&s;ideration, to know what rea&s;on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had to make Warr again&s;t the <HI>Wel&s;h; Wales</HI> had ever been a free Countrey, not &s;ubject to any Prince, except their own; they owed no Homage or Alegiance neither to <HI>England,</HI> or to any other Crowne, or State; their Language, Lawes, and Cu&s;toms, were of their own in&s;titu|tions, to which Lawes both Prince and people were &s;ubject; they lived quietly upon their owne, and they never went forth of their owne bounds to rob the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or to &s;poile and invade <HI>England,</HI> or any other Nation. Then the que|&s;tion is with much ea&s;e propo&s;ed and an&s;wered. What cau&s;e did the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> give to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to make Warre upon them, to invade, plunder, &s;poile, and kill? the An&s;wer is, or may be, Be|cau&s;e the <HI>English</HI> were ambitious, and covetous, and al&s;o &s;tronger then their Neighbours, and being able and willing to do injury, and oppre&s;s the <HI>Welsh,</HI> they many times attempted to &s;ub|ject and conquer them; and they (on the other &s;ide) did manfully re&s;i&s;t, and oppo&s;e their <HI>English</HI> Invadors, as this brief Relation will truly declare and manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus force re&s;i&s;ted force, the <HI>Saxons, Danes, English, Irish,</HI> and <HI>Flemmings,</HI> all &s;everally, and &s;ometimes joyned together, to conquer, and make prey and purcha&s;e of poor <HI>Wales,</HI> they all &s;triving to have the Goods and Lands that be|longed not to them; and the <HI>Welsh</HI> men (with

They had kept their Country &amp; language 2700. years, and the Hi&s;torians, Anti|quaries, and Gentry of that Nation did record their Laws, Pedigrees, and Genealogies, with as much, or more, exact truth then many, or a|ny other Nations. They had lived under their own Governours (from the time of <HI>Heli</HI> the High Prie&s;t of the Jews,) 1800 years before <HI>Cad|wallador,</HI> who went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and died there; from which time the chief Rulers of <HI>Wales,</HI> were &s;ometimes &s;tiled Kings, &s;ometimes Princes; the&s;e were many times under one King or Prince, of <HI>Northwales;</HI> &s;ometimes they had three Princes or Kings, as <HI>North-Wales, South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Powis Land.</HI> The&s;e three Princes, although they had many and mighty Enemies, did often make Warre upon each other, &s;poiling, and harra&s;ing their Countrey, to the advantage of their Ene|mies and ruine of them&s;elves. But to proceed to the Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P><HI>Lhewelyn ap Jorworth,</HI> being lawfull Prince, took the Government, 1194. <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t of that Name being then King of <HI>England.</HI> This Prince had a quiet beginning in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> but <HI>South-Wales</HI> was much vexed; for K. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> with <HI>David ap Owen,</HI> before named, who was de|po&s;ed or expul&s;ed, came with an Army again&s;t Prince <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> who fought and beat K. <HI>John,</HI> and took <HI>David</HI> pri&s;oner, and kept him fa&s;t; and the &s;ame yeare there was another bloudy Battell fought, between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the Lords of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and many men &s;lain by the treachery of &s;ome Wel&s;h Lords, for private intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>In 12 yeares Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> had not one
<PB N="44" REF="23">months quietne&s;s, yet he was &s;till victorious.</P>
<P>1211. K. <HI>John</HI> came into <HI>Wales</HI> with a mighty Army, with a purpo&s;e to de&s;troy all that had life; but he returned with great lo&s;s: and the next year he came again, when (by rea&s;on that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King had many <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Lords to take his part) Prince <HI>Lhewelyn ap Jorworth</HI> came to an agreement with K. <HI>John,</HI> and gave him 20000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and 40 Hor&s;es: But covenants not being kept by occa&s;ion of the har&s;h dealing of the Engli&s;h Nobles, and their Officers, made to the Prince to rai&s;e an Army, and take &s;ome Ca&s;tles and Coun|tries, for which K. <HI>John</HI> cau&s;ed the Gentlemen (which he had for Pledges) to be all hang'd; and with another great Army he came into <HI>Wales</HI> a|gain, to no purpo&s;e; for K. <HI>John</HI> had his hands and head full of troubles at home, with the Pope and the <HI>French,</HI> that he was forced to leave <HI>Wales,</HI> and return, to his great grief and lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In the yeare of Grace 1214. there was great wars between the Lords of <HI>South-Wales</HI> and <HI>Powis, Wel&s;h</HI> again&s;t <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> and much mi&s;chiefe done on both &s;ides: And <HI>Anno</HI> 1215. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> made an Inrode into <HI>England;</HI> then hee wonne <HI>Shrewshury,</HI> &s;ack'd it, and returned into <HI>South-Wales,</HI> he took <HI>Caermarden</HI> from the <HI>English,</HI> rai&s;ed the Ca&s;tle, and took 12 Ca&s;tles more, and returned home triumphant: &s;hortly after he &s;ubdued all <HI>Powis Land</HI> to his obedience, and in <HI>Anno</HI> 1217. he brought all <HI>Wales</HI> to his &s;ubjection. He had
<PB N="45" REF="23">not a weekes re&s;t from the yeare 1218. to 1221. but either <HI>Welsh, English, Flemmings,</HI> or other troubles kept him from idlene&s;s, and &s;till it was his happine&s;s to be Victor.</P>
<P>King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> being reconciled to the Pope, the French expul&s;t from thence, and the Kingdome in quiet, the King (having little to do at home) would have the tother bout with <HI>Wales,</HI> which he attempted with much Charge, and bad &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;hortly after died; to whom his &s;on <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. &s;ucceeded, who made a &s;peedy expedition again&s;t <HI>Lhewelyn,</HI> and returned home with much detriment, &amp; peace was made for a &s;mal time; for in <HI>Anno</HI> 1231. K. <HI>Henry</HI> made another great preparation again&s;t the Prince, to the effect afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>In 1232. <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> made an expedition into <HI>England,</HI> and returned with much Riches and Honour. In 1233. <HI>South-Wales</HI> rai&s;ed new wars; but the Prince went in per&s;on and beat them in|to &s;ome quietne&s;s, overthrew their Ca&s;tles and &s;trong holds, and returned renowned.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame yeare K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. came in|to <HI>Wales,</HI> with a greater Army then ever, com|pact of divers Nations, with an intent to de&s;troy all he could, but was deceived in his purpo&s;e, and went home a lo&s;er: Then K. <HI>Henry</HI> &s;ent the Arch Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to make a peace with <HI>Lhew|elyn,</HI> but it could not be effected.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="24">
<P>Then this peerle&s;s Prince died, beloved, and lamented, and was buried at <HI>Conwy.</HI> He married <HI>Jone</HI> the daughter of K. <HI>John,</HI> by whom he had two &s;ons <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Griffith;</HI> this <HI>David</HI> kept his brother <HI>Griffith</HI> in pri&s;on all his raigne. The Noble Prince <HI>Lhewelyn ap Jorworth,</HI> raigned 56 years.</P>
<P>To whom <HI>David ap Lhewelyn</HI> &s;ucceeded, being the 24. Prince, <HI>Anno</HI> 1240. This Prince was cur&s;ed by the Pope, and hated by the people for impri&s;oning his Brother <HI>Griffith;</HI> for which the K. of <HI>England</HI> came again&s;t him with an Army, but a peace was made, and <HI>Griffith</HI> not releas'd, who &s;triving to break pri&s;on and e&s;cape, by tying of Lines and Sheets, with &s;uch other &s;tuff which he had, and as he gat out of a high window, he putting all his weight to the Lines, they brake, and he being fat and heavy, fell with his head downwards, where he lay a mo&s;t pittifull dead &s;pectacle, for his head and neck were beaten for|cibly into his body.</P>
<P>Then K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. (as his Predece&s;&s;ors had often done) &s;trived to have <HI>Wales</HI> under his obe|dience, to which purpo&s;e he in 1245. rai&s;ed a mighty Army, and was more mightily met and foyled by Prince <HI>David;</HI> &s;oone after <HI>David</HI> died, when he had Ruled 5 years, 1246.</P>
<P><HI>Lhewelyn ap Griffith,</HI> or the Son of <HI>Griffith</HI> that dyed with a fall, was the 25 Prince, for his Un|kle, Prince <HI>David</HI> had no I&s;&s;ue, this man was va|liant,
<PB N="47" REF="24">but unfortunate, for his two Brethren, <HI>O|wen</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> made War upon him, but he vanqui&s;ht them, and was Ma&s;ter of all <HI>Wales:</HI> he &s;trived much to &s;hake off the yoke of <HI>England,</HI> and perforce hee cha&s;ed all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> out of <HI>Wales,</HI> with great &s;laughter, 1256. King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, with two great Armies entred <HI>Wales</HI> in &s;everall places, did much &s;poile, received much lo&s;s, and returned angry.</P>
<P>In 1258. <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley</HI> with <HI>Germane</HI> Hor&s;emen, did much &s;poile, and killed many in <HI>Wales,</HI> but in the end, the Wel&s;hmen gave them &s;uch welcome, that few of the <HI>Germanes</HI> return'd. In the&s;e times in all places in <HI>VVales</HI> was conti|nuall &s;trife, &s;poile, and bloud&s;hed; for <HI>the</HI> En|gli&s;h <HI>would Have; and the</HI> Wel&s;h <HI>would Hold:</HI> In 1267. <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> entred <HI>England,</HI> &s;poyled and de|&s;troyed <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and much of that County; but after that, the Wel&s;h had a great overthrow at a place called <HI>Clun,</HI> and in 1268. <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>England</HI> with an Army entred <HI>VVales</HI> again; but by the means of Cardinall <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">tobonus</HI> (the Popes Legate) a Peace was made, and the Prince paid to the K. of <HI>England</HI> 30000 Marks. In <HI>Anno</HI> 1272. King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. died, and his &s;on <HI>Edward</HI> the 1. went to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> from whence he &s;ent a Summons to command Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> to come to him and doe homage: But the Prince refu&s;ed, and would not come to the King. Then two Engli&s;h Armies entred <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Wales,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="25">at once; but (upon hard conditions) a Peace was concluded, which la&s;ted not long; for <HI>Anno</HI> 1281. they fell to it cruelly again: The Prince &s;aid, that <HI>it was a bard thing to live in War alwayes; but it was harder to live in continuall &s;lave|ry:</HI> &s;oon after, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was &s;laine, va|liantly fighting, and all <HI>Wales</HI> fell to the Crowne of <HI>England,</HI> after it had continued from <HI>Brute</HI> and <HI>Camber</HI> 2418 years, to the year of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> 1282.</P>
