<HEAD>The Author's Additions, and Adverti&s;ement to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is not any Itch of wri|ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es me, Courteous Reader, that I here pre&s;ent thee with the&s;e Curio&s;ities: tho&s;e that know me, have found me very free from this fooli&s;h pa&s;&s;ion. But a per&s;on of quality, whom to deny any thing, were a great Crime in me, hath forced them out of my Clo&s;et, whence otherwi&s;e they never &s;hould have come: &s;ince I had re&s;olv'd, after &s;o many Calumnies indured, never to adven|ture more into the Publick View, having &s;o oftentimes &s;ighed forth tho&s;e words of a Roman Prince; <HI>Utinam ne&s;ci&s;&s;em literas!</HI> But in fine, the Intreaties, and Commands of my friends have prevailed again&s;t my own Re&s;olution; and I am forced, I con|fe&s;&s;e, to this Publication; &s;ince I could not but fore&s;ee well enough, that my Enemies would not relli&s;h at all this other E&s;&s;ay of my pen: notwith&s;tanding after all this, I have wherewith to comfort my &s;elf; &s;ince one of the greate&s;t Prelates of our Age hath
<PB REF="6">condemned their In&s;olence. Receive there|fore favourably this Di&s;cour&s;e, Courteous Reader; and remember what we all are: I will not &s;ay, thou &s;halt find all things perfect here; for I am no Angel: and if there be any defects, we mu&s;t accu&s;e our Mortality, which renders all Mankind &s;ub|ject to Errour. But above all, know, that I am no whit ob&s;tinate, or &s;elf-conceited, nor never was; I take in very good part what Adverti&s;ements &s;oever are given me: nei|ther doe I account my &s;elfe &s;o knowing, but that I &s;hall be very ready to learne of any man: they are fooles only, and vain|glorious, that refu&s;e to be taught; and the Ignorant only &s;ay, They know all. As for my part, Courteous Reader, u&s;e me but friendly, and I &s;hall require nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>If thou thinke it &s;trange, that a man of the Church, as I am, &s;hould adventure on &s;o bold, and daring a Subject, as this &s;eems to be; con&s;ider, I pray thee, that many of my Profe&s;&s;ion have put forth things much more bold then the&s;e; and even &s;uch as have been e&s;teemed Dangerous too. Thus <HI>Tri|themius</HI> the Abbot put forth his <HI>Polygraphy,</HI> and his <HI>Steganography,</HI> where the Calling forth of Spirits is plainely delivered; not|with&s;tanding he makes other u&s;e of it, then our Sorcerers doe. <HI>Gulielmus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Pa|ris</HI>
<PB REF="6">hath not only written of Naturall Ma|gick, but he al&s;o both perfectly under&s;tood, and practi&s;'d it, as the Learned <HI>Picus Mi|randula</HI> reports of him. Another Learned Bi&s;hop al&s;o, <HI>Albertus Magnus</HI> by name, hath taught the grounds of it with admiration. <HI>Ro|ger Bacon,</HI> and <HI>Joannes de Rupe&s;ci&s;&s;a,</HI> both Franci&s;can Friers, have done the &s;ame. <HI>Pe|trus Cirvellus,</HI> a Spaniard of the &s;ame Or|der, hath publi&s;hed to the Chri&s;tian World a Book in <HI>Folio,</HI> of the Foure Prin|cipall kinds of Divination, and all the Ma|ximes of Judiciary A&s;trology. <HI>P. de Al|liaco,</HI> a Cardinall, and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> hath written of the &s;ame Subject: as al&s;o hath <HI>Junctinus,</HI> a Prie&s;t of <HI>Florence,</HI> and a D^r. of Divinity. And &s;ince we are fallen upon the <HI>Italians,</HI> have not <HI>Aurelius Augu|rellus,</HI> and <HI>Pantheus,</HI> both Prie&s;ts, the one a <HI>Venetian,</HI> the other a <HI>Tarvi&s;ian,</HI> delivered the Fooleries of the Philo&s;ophers Stone, the one in his <HI>Chry&s;opaea,</HI> and the other in his <HI>Voar|chadumia? Mar&s;ilius Ficinus</HI> al&s;o, a Prie&s;t, how full of Super&s;tition are his writings? yea what Super&s;tition is there in the World, that he hath not publi&s;hed to open View? <HI>Antonius Bernardus Mirandulanus,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ca&s;erte,</HI> hath, after his example, maintained a world of things, cleane contrary to our Religion, in his book, <HI>De &s;ingulari certamine.</HI>
<PB REF="7">The Cardinall <HI>Cajetan de Vio</HI> hath done the very &s;ame: and <HI>Giovanni Ingegneri,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cabo d'I&s;tria,</HI> hath newly bu&s;ied him&s;elf in maintaining the Grounds of Phy&s;iogno|my. And before all the&s;e, <HI>Syne&s;ius,</HI> a Chri|&s;tian Bi&s;hop, wrote a book of the Interpre|tation of Dreames, commented on afterwards by <HI>Nicephorus Gregoras,</HI> a Bi&s;hop al&s;o, or Patriarch, of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> I omit the Super&s;titions of <HI>Joachimus Abbas;</HI> and of <HI>Savanarola,</HI> a Dominican Frier; with Car|dinall <HI>Bembus</HI> his <HI>Gli A&s;olani; Aeneas Syl|vius</HI> (who was afterward Pope <HI>Pius</HI> II.) his <HI>Lucrece;</HI> the book &s;o full of all Lewd|ne&s;&s;e of <HI>Poggius</HI> the Florentine, who was Se|cretary to the Pope. Neither will I men|tion the <HI>Macaronick Hi&s;tory,</HI> put forth under the name of <HI>Merlin Coccai,</HI> but written by <HI>The|ophilus Folengius,</HI> a Benedictine Frier; nor an infinite number of other books, written by Church-men, with which, Kind Read|er, if thou compare this of mine, thou wilt find, if any blame me, they do it wrong|fully.</P>
<P>And that thou may&s;t be fully acquainted with my purpo&s;e in this di&s;cour&s;e, know, that I give no more credit to any of the&s;e Curio&s;ities, then the Catholique and Apo|&s;tolique Church permits; and that I have not publi&s;hed them, at lea&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t
<PB REF="7">nice and tickli&s;h, but after many Chri&s;tians of my Profe&s;&s;ion; as thou may&s;t perceive by the Sequel. As touching <HI>Jeroboam's</HI> Calves, I am not the fir&s;t, who hath &s;aid, that the making of them was Lawfull, and that this King was no Idolater: the Learn|ed <HI>Genebrard</HI> hath led me the way; and af|ter him, <HI>Moncaeus;</HI> and before them, <HI>Abiu|dan:</HI> and I &s;hall be very ready to withdraw my &s;elf out of their company, if I find there be any danger in't. If thou object, that the&s;e Curio&s;ities, ought not therefore to be called, <HI>Unheard-of;</HI> &s;eeing that they have been hand|led by others: I an&s;wer, that the greate&s;t part of them were <HI>Vnheard-of,</HI> to Chri&s;ti|ans; &s;ince that I have collected them out of the writings of the Jewes; where they were delivered &s;o ob&s;curely, that even tho&s;e of their own Nation neglected them. As for the <HI>Tali&s;manicall</HI> Figures, they were &s;o <HI>Vnheard-of</HI> in our Age, that their very name was not &s;o much as knowne. Now that thou may&s;t have a more perfect under&s;tand|ing of what is delivered in the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e, be plea&s;ed to adde this which fol|loweth.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t Part, <HI>Cap.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 7. I &s;ay, that I had not been able to di&s;cover the rea&s;on, why <HI>Plutarch, Strabo, Trogus, Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> had accu&s;ed the Jewes of wor&s;hip|ping
<PB REF="8">a Vine: I have &s;ince found, that it was, becau&s;e they had heard &s;ay, and even them|&s;elves &s;een, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, that in the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> there was a Golden Vine, with it's leaves, and clu&s;ters of grapes, made again&s;t the wall; as it is de&s;cribed by <HI>Jo&s;ephus. Interior porta,</HI> &s;aies he, <HI>tota inau|rata erat, ut dixi, &amp; circum eam auratus pa|ries, de&s;uper autem habebat aureos pampinos, unde racemi, &s;tatur&acirc; hominis, dependebant.</HI> I know very well, that many &s;o under&s;tand the words of <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> as if this Vine were not of Solid, Ma&s;&s;y gold, but only gilded, after the manner of <HI>Phrygian</HI> work. But the other <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Gorion,</HI> contradicts this Interpretation of the words: for, &s;peaking in the &s;ame Hi&s;tory (of the De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>) both more clear|ly, and more at large, of this Golden Vine, and it's bunches of Grapes, he &s;aies: <HI>Fecit in&s;uper Herodes vitem de auro mundo, &amp; po&s;u|it in &s;ummitatem col&uuml;mnarum, cujus pondus erat mille talentorum aureorum. Erat autem vitis ip&s;a facta opere ingenio&s;o, habens ramos perplexos; cujus folia, &amp; germina facta erant ex rutilanti auro; botri autem ex auro fulvo; &amp; grana ejus, acini, atque folliculi facti erant ex lapidibus precio&s;is: totum&abque; opus erat fa|brefactum opere vario, ut e&s;&s;et mirandum &s;pecta|culum, &amp; gaudium cordis omnibus intuentious
<PB REF="8">ip&s;am.</HI> And pre&s;ently after he addes: <HI>Mul|ti quoque &s;criptores Romani te&s;tantur, &s;e eam|vidi&s;&s;e, cum de&s;olaretur Templum.</HI> Now the fore-named Authors, <HI>Plutarch, Strabo,</HI> and the re&s;t, &s;eeing that the Jewes had in their Temple a Golden Vine, &s;o rich, &s;o preci|ous, and of &s;o admirable workman&s;hip; they were ea&s;ily per&s;waded that they wor&s;hipped it, in honour of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> who was the fir&s;t that &s;ubdued the Ea&s;t: and this is the Opi|nion of <HI>Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> who lived at the &s;ame time, when this Beautifull Temple was de&s;troyed. <HI>Sed quia,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>Sacerdotes Judaeorum tibia, tympani&s;que concinebant, he|dera vinciebantur, viti&s;que aurea in Templo reperta; Liberum Patrem coli, domitorem Ori|entis, quidam arbitrati &s;unt; nequaqu&agrave;m con|gruentibus in&s;titutis: Quippe</HI> Liber <HI>fe&s;tos, lae|to&s;que ritus po&s;uit;</HI> Judaeorum <HI>mos ab&s;urdus, &s;ordidu&s;que.</HI> But we pa&s;&s;e by this Impious Author, who makes a mock at the Religion of the Jewes on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the Second Part, <HI>Chap.</HI> 4 <HI>pag.</HI> 86. where I render the Greek words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, by the&s;e French words, <HI>Menues Pen&s;ees,</HI> Little thoughts, I have tran&s;lated the Greek word, <GAP DESC="foreign"> as it ought to be under&s;tood, which &s;ignifies properly, <HI>Little, Delicate,</HI> and <HI>&s;mall:</HI> as we call one of the Greek letters <HI>Yp&s;ilon,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>the Little Y.</HI> Now the Se|cond
<PB REF="9">Thoughts are Small, Fine, and Delicate, becau&s;e they con&s;ider things ab&s;tracted, and &s;eparated from Matter; which the Fir&s;t doe not: And therefore we &s;ay in <HI>French</HI> very e|legantly, when wee &s;peake of one that hath brought forth any curious conceit, <HI>voila vne pen&s;&eacute;e bien de&s;ti&egrave;e.</HI></P>
<P>In the following Chap. you may adde the&s;e admirable <HI>Gamahes.</HI> At <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> in the Church of St. <HI>John,</HI> you have, on a certaine &s;tone, an Old Hermite, perfectly drawn by Nature on|ly; but with &s;o much exactne&s;&s;e, that there &s;eemes not to be wanting any thing that be|longs to one of that &s;ort of men. For he is re|pre&s;ented in a De&s;ert, &s;uitable to his profe&s;&s;i|on, and &s;itting neare a Brooks &s;ide, with a Clock in his hand. This Naturall piece of Picture, almo&s;t fully an&s;wers That, they de|liver St. <HI>Anthony</HI> in. In the Temple of S. <HI>So|phia,</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> there is al&s;o &s;een, up|on a plain white Marble, the Image of S. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> cloathed with a Camels skinne; be|ing only defective in this, that Nature hath drawn him but with one foote. At <HI>Ravenna,</HI> in the Church of St. <HI>Vitalis,</HI> there is to be &s;een a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Frier, naturally drawn, up|on a &s;tone of an A&s;h-colour. At <HI>Sneiberg</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> there was found in the Earth, a cer|taine little Statue of a kind of unrefined Me|tall, naturally made; which repre&s;ented, in a
<PB REF="9">round Figure, a man having a little Child at his back: and whoever hath any where &s;eene the picture of St. <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> may ea&s;ily con|ceive the &s;hape of this. It is not long &s;ince there was found, in the <HI>Hercinian</HI> Fore&s;t, a Stone that naturally repre&s;ented the figure of an old man, with a long beard, and crowned with a Triple Crowne, as the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> is. Ob&s;erve likewi&s;e that many of the&s;e Stones, or <HI>Gamahes,</HI> are called all by the &s;ame name, becau&s;e they have alwayes the &s;ame figure. So that, which repre&s;ents the Eyes of a man, is called <HI>Leucophthalmos:</HI> that which beares the figure of a Heart, <HI>Encardia:</HI> that which hath the &s;hape of a Tongue repre&s;ented on it, <HI>Glo&s;&s;o|petra:</HI> that which is figured like the Genitals, <HI>Enorchis:</HI> and if it repre&s;ent as well the &s;ecret parts of man, as of a woman, it is then called <HI>Diphys,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To the figures that are found in Plants, and Flowers, you may likewi&s;e adde tho&s;e which repre&s;ent &s;ome kind of Letters, or words: as the <HI>Hyacinth,</HI> on which the Po&euml;t &s;ayes, is written the Complaint of the fair <HI>Phoebus,</HI> for having killed <HI>Hyacinthus;</HI> whom he afterward transformed into a Flowre of the &s;ame name: and this Complaint of his is expre&s;t in the&s;e two Letters, <GAP DESC="foreign">, which make up the word, <HI>Ai,</HI> which we frequently u&s;e in all kinds of &s;orrow.</P>

<P>As for the diver&s;e kinds of Figures that wee meet withall in bea&s;ts, (which we have like|wi&s;e examined in the &s;ame Chapter,) I have found nothing more worthy our admiration, then what I have been lately informed of by Eye-witne&s;&s;es: namely, that it is not long &s;ince, that in diver&s;e parts of <HI>Poitou</HI> it rained a certaine kind of little creatures, about an Inch in bigne&s;&s;e; &s;ome whereof were in the &s;hape of Bi&s;hops, with a Rochet and hood, clo&s;ed up in a &s;hell, or skin, &s;o admirably, that one would have thought it to have been of burni&s;hed gold: others were in &s;hape like Fri|ers, with a Frocke and Cowle: &s;ome were of a certaine horrid &s;hape; and others like I know not what. It is a great wonder, if this Rela|tion come among the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> if wee have
<PB REF="10">not very &s;peedily &s;ome &s;trange Interpretation of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> &s;uch a one as <HI>Ananias Je|raucurius,</HI> and <HI>Raphael Eglinus</HI> have given, (as we &s;hall &s;hew hereafter) of the dark Vi&s;i|ons of <HI>Daniel,</HI> by the help of certaine Chara|cters found upon two Herrings, taken up up-the coa&s;t of <HI>Norway.</HI> But to pa&s;&s;e by the&s;e Fooleries.</P>
<P>In the Sixth Chapter, where I &s;peake of di|ver&s;e &s;orts of <HI>Tali&s;mans,</HI> and prove their ver|tue, according to the opinion of the Ea&s;terne parts; you mu&s;t take heed, that you mixe not all &s;orts of Characters, and figures, indiffe|rently, with the&s;e <HI>Tali&s;mans.</HI> For though many of them beare the Figures of the living creatures de&s;cribed in the Heavens, which we u&s;ually call Con&s;tellations, they are not there|fore pre&s;ently to pa&s;&s;e for true <HI>Tali&s;mans;</HI> but either &s;ome kind of Mony; as that of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> whereon were ingraven all the Cele&s;tial Signes; and that of <HI>Augu&s;tus Coe&s;ar,</HI> on which he cau&s;ed the Sign of <HI>Capricorn</HI> to be figured; for no other rea&s;on, but only in me|mory that he was born under that Signe.

<P>The&s;e ver&s;es have often made me doubt, whether or no, many of tho&s;e pretious &s;tones that we &s;ee in Ancient Rings, which are com|monly taken for <HI>Tali&s;mans,</HI> (&s;uch as was that of our Countryman <HI>Bagarris,</HI> whereof I make mention:) on which we find <HI>Cupids, Bacchus,</HI> Vines, bunches of grapes, and vine-branches ingraven, were not rather the effects of &s;ome gallant Humor of &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, who de|&s;ired to weare on their fingers the Emblemes of Wine, rather then any other figures.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Sixth Chapter, where I &s;peake of the power of Re&s;emblance, I know not how, in the 172. page, the word, <HI>France,</HI> hath &s;lipt in, in&s;tead of <HI>Italy.</HI> For it is in <HI>Italy</HI> chiefly, where the Lepro&s;ie is &s;o frequent, by rea&s;on of the great quantity of Hogs fle&s;h that is eaten there, more then in any other
<PB REF="12">Kingdome: and the rea&s;on that in <HI>France,</HI> we &s;ee &s;ome infected with this di&s;ea&s;e, is, becau&s;e that here, next to the <HI>Italians,</HI> they eate more hogs fle&s;h, then any where el&s;e. Neither do I &s;ay this, but according to the opinion of Phy&s;icians, without the lea&s;t purpo&s;e of of|fending any, either Strangers, or tho&s;e of my owne Nation. In a word, Courteous Rea|der, I &s;hall de&s;ire thee to interpret in good part, what&s;oever thou &s;halt find in this Book; &s;eeing that my purpo&s;e is to deale clearely, as one exempt from pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the 77. page of the &s;ame Chapter, my intent is not to ranke <HI>Jo&s;eph's</HI> gift of Interpre|ting Dreames with the Art of Conjecturing at the meaning of <HI>Dreames:</HI> Nor yet to reject the order of the <HI>Commandements,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Church, and to introduce that which is &s;et downe, <HI>page</HI> 291. for I there follow the <HI>Jewes</HI> manner of counting them.</P>

<P>THey that publi&s;h to the world any new, and Unheard-of Doctrine; that they may give it the greater Authority, and make it pa&s;&s;e with the more credit, &s;hew fir&s;t of all the Integrity of the Man, that was the fir&s;t Inventor of it: that &s;o, the good
<PB N="3" REF="22">opinion that is conceived of the Author, may take away all &s;u&s;pition, or jealou&s;ie, from the things that &s;hall be delivered. The choyce points of learning which we &s;hall here lay down, are &s;o new, that I have adventured to call them <HI>Vnheard-of.</HI> It concerns me there|fore, for the better &s;ecuring them from &s;u&s;pi|tion, to take upon me the defence of the Ea&s;tern men, and chiefly of the <HI>Jewes,</HI> who are the Authors of them, and in point of Curious learning, to defend their innocency, hitherto &s;o much injured.</P>
<P N="1">1. This nation is commonly abhorred for foure rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 3. la&s;t Ob|jections are an|&s;wered in the follow|ing chap,</NOTE> their Idola|try; which all Authors make them guilty of. The &s;econd is, their fooli&s;h vanityes, that their books are full of. The third is, by rea&s;on of their bla&s;phemies, they to this day vomit up again&s;t our Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And the la&s;t is, for the errors that they main|taine, contrary to the Law. The Fir&s;t of the&s;e conceits is grounded on a fal&s;e per&s;wa&s;ion: for, after that it was once believed that the Jewes wor&s;hiped the head of an A&s;se, Hogs, and the Clouds; it was pre&s;ently concluded, that con&s;equently their writings could not be free from the&s;e impieties. The &s;econd pro|ceeds from the little knowledge men gene|rally have of the bookes of the Jewes. The third, from the hatred men beare to the
<PB N="4" REF="23">Jewi&s;h Authors. And the fourth, from the Selfe conceitedne&s;s of tho&s;e that accu&s;e them.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the fir&s;t of the&s;e Objections, <HI>Ap|pion,</HI> as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> affirmes, was the fir&s;t, that forged it out of his owne braine: and not|with&s;tanding that this excellent Author of the Jewi&s;h Antiquities hath learnedly confuted him; Yet <HI>Plutarch</HI> takes it &s;till up for a Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Symp. <HI>4.</HI> c. <HI>5.</HI> Hi&s;t. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> al&s;o, after him, brings it in, in his Hi&s;tory, as a Prodigious thing: in &s;o much that the Fable at length pa&s;&s;ing for a Truth, it hath gone for currant, even with the mo&s;t &s;erious Hi&s;torians. Now this wor|&s;hip of the Jewes (&s;ay their Writers) was after this manner. There was an Altar e|rected; under which having performed &s;ome certaine ceremonies, a Golden Statue of an A&s;&s;e was &s;et up upon it, (&s;ome make mention of the head onely) then, the chiefe Prie&s;t having cen&s;ed it, all the People, put|ting their hand to their mouth, bowed down and wor&s;hiped it. The very &s;ame Adorati|on, in a manner, they u&s;ed (as the&s;e Au|thors report) to the Statue of a Hog.</P>
<Q>Judaeus licet &amp; Porcinum numen adorat.</Q>
<P>Sayes <HI>Petronius:</HI> as al&s;o to a Golden Vine; but with this difference, (&s;ayes <HI>Plu|tarke,</HI> with <HI>Strabo, Trogus Pompeius,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus:</HI>) that the Prie&s;ts, when
<PB N="5" REF="23">they Sacrifi&s;ed to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> were crowned with Jvy; and going with Flutes, and Drummes, &s;ounding before them, they bowed down before this Golden Tree, which was religiou&s;ly pre&s;erved within their Tem|ple. Concerning their wor&s;hiping the Clouds, the opinions are divers: &s;ome af|firming, that the Jewes had &s;ome Figures of them made in their places of Devotion: others &s;ay, not. But the&s;e are meere Fan|cies. So that, to make it appeare more clear then the Noon-day, that this Nation is no whit guilty of the&s;e Crimes; even <HI>Tacitus</HI> him&s;elfe, who had before accu&s;ed them of Jdolatry, forgetting what he had &s;aid before, addes pre&s;ently after, <HI>Nulla &s;imulachra vrbi|bus &s;uis, nedum templis e&s;&s;e:</HI> That they have no Images in their Cities, much le&s;&s;e in their Temples: So farre are they from wor&s;hip|ing the Statues of a Hog, or Vine, or the figures of the Clouds.</P>

<P><HI>Strabo</HI> writes the very &s;ame: and in the Reigne of <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> and of <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> they were generally called, <HI>Coelicolae;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cod. lib. <HI>16.</HI> Tit. <HI>8.</HI> leg. <HI>18.</HI></NOTE> and for this very rea&s;on: as you may &s;ee in the con&s;titu|tions of this Emperour.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="24">
<P>But let us once teach the Ancients,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t Objecti|on an|&s;wered.</NOTE> &s;ince they have &s;o often taught us; and pretend, for&s;ooth, to have delivered nothing over to us but pure Truthes. If it be true, that the Jewes &s;hould have given them&s;elves over to the vanities of wor&s;hiping the&s;e Idols here &s;poken of: how comes it to pa&s;&s;e, that their true God &s;hould never, in all the Scrip|tures which he hath given them, lay this Crime to their charge as well as any other? And here we cannot &s;ay of This, as we u&s;e to &s;ay of our owne bookes: That a thing may have been, and yet not have been &s;poken of. For, in this Law, which all acknowledge to be mo&s;t &s;evere, the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e: For, in point of Crimes, not &s;o much as the lea&s;t is omitted. Neither can any &s;ay, that Idolatry hath &s;prung up &s;ince the wri|ting of the Old Te&s;tament: For, be&s;ides that, the enemies of the Jewes would have then ca&s;t it in their teeth, as mo&s;t abomina|ble; The above named Authors affirme; that the Law forbidding them the eating of Hogs fle&s;h, had not been given them, but meerely becau&s;e they had wor&s;hiped this Bea&s;t. But why then doe they not, by the &s;ame rea&s;on conclude, that this People had wor&s;hiped Conies, Hares, Camels, O&s;tridg|es, and Ravens: Since the eating of the&s;e was al&s;o forbidden them?</P>
<PB N="7" REF="24">
<P N="3">3. We &s;ay then, that the&s;e are meere ca|lumnies; or rather Fanta&s;tick Opinions, grounded upon the Jewes &s;o religious ab|&s;taining from the fle&s;h of this Bea&s;t; in o|bedience to the Precept which was given them, for their better pre&s;ervation from the Lepro&s;ie; a di&s;ea&s;e they were otherwi&s;e ve|ry &s;ubject unto: and here you &s;ee the Origi|nall of the Fable. As for the Golden Vine, and the Honours they are &s;aid to have paid to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> I cannot di&s;cover, I confe&s;&s;e, in any Author, the ri&s;e of this errour: and I conceive, the fir&s;t that &s;pake of this, might happily mi&s;take the name of the Jewes, for &s;ome other People; as we &s;ee it u&s;ually hap|pen in Authors, in the like ca&s;e. Or el&s;e, &s;ome Apo&s;tate Jewes having been &s;een pra|cti&s;ing the&s;e acts of Idolatry, it was con&s;e|quently concluded, that the whole Nation was guilty of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But an account may more ea&s;ily be given of the cau&s;e of the errour, in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of their wor&s;hiping the Clouds; which might &s;pring from that miraculous Cloud, which was light on one &s;ide, and darke on the o|ther, and was guide to the Children of I&s;ra|ell in the Wilderne&s;&s;e.

And now &s;ee, what excellent rea&s;on we have, to re|ceive this Tradition for a true one. What learned people we &s;hould be, had we no o|ther Hi&s;torians, but the Poets! I know ve|ry
<PB N="13" REF="27">well, that the Fable might po&s;&s;ibly have taken its originall from the Hi&s;tory: but where &s;hall we find tho&s;e can witne&s;&s;e, that it did &s;o? Whereas, on the other &s;ide, we know, that the&s;e. Fables are as ancient with the Greekes, as A&s;trology it &s;elfe. We may therefore, from this very particular pa&s;&s;age, conclude, what manner of &s;pirit reigned in the writers of this Nation; who&s;e delight it alwayes hath been, to put their fooli&s;h Fables upon the world, for Truths. And here I &s;hall adventure to deliver, what I have &s;ometimes conceived, touching the ground of this Errour. <HI>Sidon,</HI> in the lan|guage of the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> who are <HI>Syrians,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>a Fi&s;h,</HI> as <HI>Heurnius</HI> reports, after <HI>Ju&s;tin.</HI> Now <HI>Sidon</HI> is a part of <HI>Syria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbar, Phil. in Chald. f. <HI>32.</HI> Notis in Math. fol. <HI>16.</HI></NOTE> which in Arabick &s;ignifies an <HI>Inflation,</HI> or <HI>Swel|ling,</HI> as <HI>Kir&s;tenius</HI> affirmes.

<P N="5">5. This other Conjecture is not, in my judgment, very farre wide of the truth: namely, that the <HI>Syrians</HI> were accu&s;ed of wor&s;hipping Fi&s;hes, becau&s;e they wor&s;hiped the Idol <HI>Dagon;</HI> which &s;ome have concei|ved to have been halfe Fi&s;h, and halfe Man, in the forme of a <HI>Triton,</HI> or <HI>Syren:</HI> but with

<P>Neither doe we any where read, that <HI>Aa|ron</HI> was at all reproved of God, for having made it.</P>
<P N="8">8. So that the conclu&s;ion, which we may draw from hence, is; that the Cherubins which were on the Arke, were really made in the &s;hape of Calves: and that accord|ing to this Doctrine, <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> in imitating them, could not in any wi&s;e be counted an Idolater, but onely a Schi&s;matick, or Sepa|rati&s;t from the wor&s;hip, that was performed in <HI>Jern&s;alem:</HI> notwith&s;tanding that the &s;ame befell him, that had happened to <HI>Aaron</HI> be|fore him; namely, that though His Purpo&s;e was good, yet neverthele&s;&s;e there were among the People, that wor&s;hipped them: and this is the rea&s;on, they are reproved by God. Now that hee had no intention at all to &s;et up Idolatry, by this Act, appeares clear|ly in this; that the Kings his Succe&s;&s;ors, who all were of the &s;ame Beliefe, are not a|ny where reproved for this crime, untill the Reigne of wicked <HI>Achab,</HI> who was &s;educed by his wife <HI>Jezabell,</HI> the mo&s;t Imperious woman that ever was. Thus we read in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Kings,</HI> that <HI>Jehu</HI> did that which
<PB N="24" REF="33">was right in the &s;ight of the Lord; Yet ne|verthele&s;&s;e, <HI>Non reliquit vitulos aureos, qui erant in Bethel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4. <HI>Reg.</HI> 10.30.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; in Dan.</HI> And I would faine know, if this King &s;hould have wor|&s;hipped the&s;e Calves, how he could have done that which was right in the &s;ight of God, who never puni&s;hed his people &s;o &s;e|verely, as when they had given them&s;elves up to wor&s;hip Idols? And how <HI>A&s;a</HI> in like manner, King of <HI>Samaria,</HI> could have walk|ed in the wayes of <HI>David,</HI> if he had beene tainted with this horrible Crime? <HI>Et fecit A&s;a rectum ante con&s;pectum Domini, &s;icut Da|vid pater ejus:</HI> and yet notwith&s;tanding, <HI>Ex|cel&s;a non ab&s;tulit,</HI> He took not away the High places, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Vitulos,</HI> the Calves. As if the Author of the holy Scriptureshad purpo|&s;ed to prevent the Objection which is u&s;u|ally made, concerning the erecting of the&s;e Calves to an evill End: for the&s;e words &s;eeme to have been &s;et downe &s;o expre&s;ly, meerly for the confutation of tho&s;e men that are wedded to their owne wills, and for the clearing of the truth of that, which I have here delivered: <HI>Cor A&s;a perfectum fuit cum Domino, et&s;i Excel&s;a non ab&s;tulerit.</HI> Which is an Infallible Argument, that they acknow|ledged in the&s;e Calves, or Cherubins, the &s;ame which they of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> did in tho&s;e of the Arke; namely, the pre&s;ence of the In|vi&s;ible
<PB N="25" REF="33">God, &s;itting there, as on his Throne; notwith&s;tanding that many, out of &s;implici|ty, wor&s;hipped the bare figure of this <HI>Work of Mens</HI> hands: And this is that, which God &s;o often complaines of. As if this were the Literall meaning of this Pa&s;&s;age; to wit: that the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had indeed done that which was right in the &s;ight of God, and had lived according to his Lawes: yet, that they might have done better, if they had ta|ken away the&s;e Cherubins, which were the cau&s;e of the de&s;truction of many, who made other u&s;e of them, then that for which they were intended. I remember to have read &s;omewhere to this purpo&s;e, of a Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mar&s;eille;</HI> who &s;eeing, that many of his peo|ple behaved them&s;elves toward the Images, that are u&s;ually placed in Churches, with &s;o great re&s;pect, as that one day he ob&s;erved &s;ome of their actions that came within the compa&s;&s;e of Idolatry; he cau&s;ed them all to be broken to pieces, leaving only a very few in &s;ome certain places of his Dioce&s;s: So true it is, that we often abu&s;e tho&s;e things, which were in&s;tituted only to good ends. I &s;hall only adde one word more, for the defending of the Innocence of the <HI>Samaritans;</HI> which is: that, when <HI>Salmonazar</HI> had ran&s;acked their Country, he &s;ent into it Colonies out of <HI>Per|&s;ia;</HI> who falling to commit Idolatry, as they

<P>Hence we may &s;afely conclude, that nei|ther the number of daies, nor yet of yeare pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Creation, can be exactly knowne, without &s;ome &s;peciall Revelation; notwith&s;tanding the endeavours of the Lear|ned <HI>Pererius</HI> to prove the contrary; who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Gon. lib. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> ta|king occa&s;ion from the&s;e words of the Wi&s;e man, <HI>dies &s;eculi quis dinumerat?</HI> affirmeth, that he &s;peaketh not here of the <HI>Yeares,</HI> but
<PB N="50" REF="46">of the <HI>Daies:</HI> and that, though the num|ber of The&s;e cannot be knowne, yet the Other may. <HI>Ergo,</HI> &s;ayes he, after a long Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Numerus annorum Munditeneri po|te&s;t, dierum autem non pote&s;t.</HI> But he ought fir&s;t to have reconciled the&s;e Authors among them&s;elves; and to &s;hew, how they have erred in their Computations. And when all is done, the neare&s;t that a man &s;hall be able to come to the Truth, will perhaps be about Twenty five, or Thirty yeares, over, or un|der; and no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 3. Object.</NOTE> The third Objection, brought by tho&s;e, that will not admit the Jewes bookes to be read, &s;eemes to have more Rea&s;on in it, then all the re&s;t. For, if they be indeed full of &s;coffings again&s;t the Life of Him, who hath given Us Ours; if they accu&s;e his Actions, dete&s;t his Doctrine, and condemne his Me|mory, as ignominious; in a word, if they are full of nothing but Bla&s;phemies again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who is he that could endure to read them? And here <HI>Sixtus Senen&s;is</HI> tri|umphs over his Enemies, and reckons up all the Impieties the I&s;raelites were ever guilty of; and there is &s;carcely any one kind of wic|kedne&s;&s;e, or villany, that he layes not to their charge. In a word, he numbers up, as well all the erroneous points of their Beliefe, as their Reproachfull &s;peeches which they vo|mit
<PB N="51" REF="46">up again&s;t the Sonne of God: &s;o that one that had not read their bookes, and knowne the Truth of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, would judge them to have been written rather by Divels, then by Men. But this Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The An|&s;wer.</NOTE> (who had not written again&s;t this Nation, but, as almo&s;t all others have done, meerely out of the hatred is generally borne, toward the&s;e <HI>Deicides,</HI>) thought peradventure, that after the burning &s;o many Jewi&s;h Libraries in <HI>Italy,</HI> and after that him&s;elfe had beene an Eye-witne&s;&s;e of Twelve Thou&s;and Volumes burnt to A&s;hes at <HI>Cremona,</HI> he thought, I &s;ay, that after &s;o rigorous an Inqui&s;ition, there could have been no more books left, by which wee might have been able to &s;atisfie our &s;elves, in the Truth of tho&s;e things that are objected again&s;t the Jewes. But he had forgot to burne the wri|tings of <HI>Galatinus</HI> too, or rather of <HI>Sebondus:</HI> (for I &s;hall make it appeare in another place, that <HI>Galatine</HI> was never the Author of that Learned Booke, intituled, <HI>de Arcanis Catho|licae &s;idei:</HI>) He had, I &s;ay, forgot to burne the&s;e Learned writings too, which doe make it clearely appeare, that the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e things that are written in this Particular, is fal&s;e; and prove, that the Bla&s;phemies, which the Ancient Rabbins uttered again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> were not meant at all of <HI>Chri&s;t, our Redeemer,</HI> but of another <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> very far
<PB N="52" REF="47">different from Ours. And this is &s;o known a Truth, that the mo&s;t furious among the Iewes dare not deny it, unle&s;&s;e they deny their <HI>Talmud.</HI> So that this Confe&s;&s;ion being &s;o much the more forcible, becau&s;e it proceeds from the mouth of our Adver&s;aries; it quite overthrowes all that <HI>Senen&s;is,</HI> and tho&s;e of his Per&s;wa&s;ion, have brought to the contrary. I will not &s;ay, but that the Later Rabbins doe more perver&s;ely handle the Controver&s;y, which is betwixt Them and Us; namely, Whether <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> be the true <HI>Me&s;sias,</HI> or not: and that, among the Heats of &s;o weighty a Di&s;pute, they doe &s;ometimes &s;peake irreve|rently of our &s;acred My&s;teries: But, (which is a very wonderfull thing, and which ought to convince all the enemies to the writings of the&s;e men;) among &s;o great a number of Ar|guments that are brought again&s;t us, by <HI>R. David Kimchi,</HI> and <HI>R. Jo&s;eph Alboni,</HI> (two Iewi&s;h Rabbins, which were both very lear|ned, and very zealous for their owne Reli|gion:) you &s;hall not find one Opprobrious &s;peech uttered again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> as that he was a &s;editious per&s;on, (as he was called in his life time,) or a Magician, or an Impo&s;tor, or a Malefactor, or any other the like Bla&s;phe|mous termes: notwith&s;tanding there is &s;carce|ly any of our Chri&s;tian Writers, that have written again&s;t the Iewes, which give them
<PB N="53" REF="47">not very hard language. They di&s;pute indeed, Whether the Go&s;pel be a Law, or not: but not, Whether the Author of it were a Wick|ed Man, or no. Nay, on the contrary, they rather confe&s;&s;e him to have religiou&s;ly kept all the Commandements of the <HI>Decalogue.</HI> They &s;ay indeed, that he was but meere Man, and not God: being blinded by the Confe&s;&s;ion, which this God of Love made of him&s;elfe: <HI>E|go &s;um vermis, &amp; non homo:</HI> but they doe not &s;ay, that he was a Wicked, Perfidious Per&s;on. They accu&s;e his Apo&s;tles indeed of Igno|rance, but not of Fal&s;ehood: as, when S. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, that the I&s;raelites demanded a King of <HI>Samuel;</HI> who gave them the &s;onne of <HI>Cis,</HI> be|ing about the age of forty years; whereas the Scripture &s;eemes to &s;ay otherwi&s;e. As al&s;o, when Saint <HI>Stephen</HI> &s;aid, that tho&s;e that went downe with <HI>Jacob</HI> into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> were &s;eventy five &s;oules in number; whereas in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> it is &s;aid, they were but &s;eventy in all. And &s;o likewi&s;e in diver&s;e other Pa&s;&s;ages, which have been, long &s;ince, often reconciled, and cleared of Errour. They deny indeed, that in the Eu|chari&s;t, a Great Body, with all its parts, can po&s;&s;ibly be in &s;o &s;mall a Mor&s;ell: but they doe not &s;ay, that the In&s;titution, and u&s;e of it in the Chri&s;tian Church, is Diabolicall, as the Hereticks &s;ay. In a word, they deny indeed, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is the true <HI>Me&s;sias;</HI> but the
<PB N="54" REF="48">doe not &s;ay, that his Doctrine is again&s;t God. Tho&s;e that de&s;ire to be more fully &s;atisfied in this Controver&s;ie, may have re|cour&s;e to a Tract, written by <HI>Genebrard,</HI> a|gain&s;t tho&s;e two Learned Jewes above na|med. To conclude then, both again&s;t <HI>Senen|&s;is,</HI> and all of his Opinion; I affirme, that the Ancient Rabbins are &s;o farre from re|proaching our <HI>Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as that, on the contrary, they allow of his Doctrine, and confirme the Hi&s;tory, which is delivered us: as I doe clearly prove, in my <HI>Adverti&s;&s;e|ment aux Doctes, touchant la nece&s;site des lan|gues Orientales,</HI> which I &s;hall, God willing, put forth very &s;hortly.</P>
<P N="9">9.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 4. Object.</NOTE> I come now to the la&s;t objection, which is: that the Bookes of the Rabbines erre, in the Interpretation of the Law: and that being full of Vaine, and ridiculous, Tra|ditions, and &s;ome that are dangerous too; they ought not to be read by Chri&s;tians, who are to &s;eeke after nothing, but the true Traditions of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and his Church.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not take upon me to an&s;wer fully, and in every particular, to this Objection: &s;ince that it cannot be denied, but that the Rabbins doe erre &s;ometimes, and that their Interpretations are &s;ometimes wide enough of the matrer. But that therefore they mu&s;t pre&s;ently be burnt, or not read at all, is a|gain&s;t
<PB N="55" REF="48">all Sence, or Rea&s;on: for, otherwi&s;e, we were to proceed in the &s;ame manner a|gain&s;t our &s;elves, and mu&s;t condemne our owne bookes al&s;o; which are &s;carcely to be found, any of them, without their Errors: I &s;peake even of tho&s;e very bookes, that are of highe&s;t e&s;teeme, and u&s;e, among us. So that if the&s;e mu&s;t all be committed to the Flame, we &s;hould &s;peedily &s;ee-o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">r Li|braries Empty; and, tho&s;e which &s;hall come after us, to be left to a mo&s;t profound ig|norance. For, who knowes not, that the works of <HI>Tertullian</HI> favour the Sect of the <HI>Montani&s;ts,</HI> where he &s;peaks of a new <HI>Para|clet,</HI> and a new Prophe&s;ie; as al&s;o, where he condemnes <HI>Second Marriages?</HI> If we but diligently peru&s;e the Writings of all the re&s;t of the Fathers, we &s;hall find, that tho&s;e of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> maintain the Rebaptizing of &s;uch, as having abjured their Here&s;ie, had been formerly baptized by Hereticks What Error is it, that the writings of the Learn|ed <HI>Origen</HI> are not polluted with? If any man out of Curio&s;ity de&s;ire to &s;ee a Ca|talogue of them, he may have recour&s;e to the Learned Epi&s;tle of St. <HI>Jerome, ad Avi|tum.</HI> Doth not St. <HI>Hilary</HI> &s;eem to detract much from the merits of our <HI>Saviour Chri&s;t,</HI> when he maintaines, that his Sacred Body was not at all capable of Suffering; and
<PB N="56" REF="49">that Hunger, Thir&s;t, Wearine&s;&s;e, and the re&s;t of Humane Infirmities, were not Natu|rall in him, but as the Schoole &s;peaks, <HI>Ab|&s;umptae?</HI> Neither did <HI>Epiphanius</HI> fall into le&s;s Errors then the&s;e, when he writes, upon tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t, <HI>Pater Major me e&s;t,</HI> that it was true al&s;o of his Divine Nature; and that, in the garden of Olives, he &s;pake not the&s;e words &s;eriou&s;ly; <HI>Pater, &s;i fieri pote&s;t, tran|&s;eat &agrave; me Calix i&s;te;</HI> but onely by way of Di&s;&s;imulation, to deceive the Devill. I pa&s;&s;e by many things delivered by him, touching the death of our <HI>Saviour Chri&s;t,</HI> which the purity of Divinity cannot allow of: as al&s;o, when in his di&s;putation again&s;t <HI>Aerius,</HI> he affirmes, that one of the Precepts left by the Apo&s;tles, was, that, during the &s;ix daies immediately before the Pa&s;&s;eo|yer, we mu&s;t eat nothing but Bread, with Salt. St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> al&s;o, in his Allegories, in which he exceeds, is not alwayes blame|le&s;&s;e: for &s;ometimes he lets fall &s;uch things, as are quite contradicting the &s;en&s;e of the Holy Scriptures. As, for example, &s;peak|ing of St. <HI>Peter's</HI> &s;inne, he holds, that this Apo&s;tle denied not <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> as God, but onely as Man: as likewi&s;e, when he makes it Lawfull for a man, that hath put away his Wife by Divorce, to marry a|nother woman, provided, &s;he al&s;o had not
<PB N="57" REF="49">been divorced. St. <HI>Jerome</HI> runs as farre into the other Extreame; for, pleading for Virginity, again&s;t <HI>Jovinian,</HI> he doth &s;o cry out again&s;t Marriage, that he makes it al|mo&s;t a &s;inne to marry: and goes on &s;o far, as to account Second Marriages to be no other then meere Fornication, and a Trade of Bawdery. St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> hath al|&s;o had his many Errours: As, when he maintaines, that the Euchari&s;t ought to be admini&s;tred to little Children; and that, if they dye without Bapti&s;me, they are Damned. You may find many other Er|rors in the Writings of this Learned Fa|ther: But they are &s;uch, as we may truly call, <HI>Happy ones;</HI> &s;ince that they gave oc|ca&s;ion to the writing of that Excellent Book of his <HI>Retractations;</HI> without which, a great part of the Learning of this mo&s;t Know|ing Father, had been concealed from us. I could proceed to reckon up &s;ome Errors of each of the re&s;t of the Fathers, both Greek and Latine, for the proving of my A&s;&s;ertion: namely, that we have the &s;ame rea&s;on to forbeare the reading of them, that we have again&s;t the books of the Rabbins: &s;o that, we &s;hould at length be reduced to this extremity, of having no other books, but only the Holy Scriptures. And yet neither could the&s;e pa&s;&s;e, if we &s;hould re&s;t only on
<PB N="58" REF="50">the Bare Letter; &s;ince there are &s;ome things found there, that &s;eem contrary to Truth. Thus <HI>Cajetan</HI> hath ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> Reg.

And when he &s;ayes al&s;o, that the Cave, which <HI>Abraham</HI> bought, was in <HI>Sichem;</HI> which was indeed in <HI>Hebron:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gee. <HI>11.</HI></NOTE> and that he bought it of the Sons of <HI>Emor,</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Sichem:</HI> whereas <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ayes, it was, of <HI>Ephron</HI> the <HI>Hittite.</HI> And &s;o likewi&s;e, when he &s;ayes, that <HI>Emor</HI> was <HI>Sichem's</HI> Sonne, when as it is &s;aid in <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. <HI>33.</HI></NOTE> quite contra|ry;
<PB N="59" REF="50">that <HI>Emor</HI> was <HI>Sichem's</HI> Father, and not his Sonne. I &s;hall not here undertake to ju&s;tifie all the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages: many great Per|&s;onages, of former Ages, have already done it very happily: &s;o that we cannot any longer, without manife&s;t Injury, &s;ay, that there is any Errour at all in them. As for the Errors of the Fathers, I &s;hould rather think charitably of them, and &s;ay; that, as St. <HI>Jerome</HI> complained in his Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ep. ad Pammac. &amp; Ocean.</NOTE> that the Writings of <HI>Origen</HI> had been cor|rupted by &s;ome Impo&s;tor; as St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> likewi&s;e complaines, in tho&s;e of St. <HI>Cypri|an:</HI> &s;o po&s;&s;ibly, tho&s;e of the other Fathers may have beene corrupted too.

<PB N="62" REF="52">without reprehending tho&s;e which have gone before us, and from who&s;e Learned writings we have derived the mo&s;t Curious, and Choy&s;e Points of Knowledge that we have. The <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> or, if you plea&s;e, the <HI>Babyloni|ans,</HI> that bordered upon the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> were the Fir&s;t, as Rabbins report, that found out the &s;ecret power of Figures. The won|ders that have been effected by them, have been acknowledged by all the Ancients, and approved of throughout all <HI>Aegypt:</HI> in &s;o much that, tho&s;e, who were the fir&s;t that have written of them, have maintained, that there was not any thing of more Excellency, and Admiration, within the compa&s;&s;e of the whole Univer&s;e: The&s;e fir&s;t Writers have been &s;econded by all tho&s;e that have come af|ter them; even down to Our owne Daies, and the Daies of our Fathers; wherein we have at length &s;een this Secret condemned, and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> accu&s;ed of Sorcery: &s;o that, to the end I may free from &s;u&s;picion, what&s;oever I &s;hall borrow from Themm, it will concern me to &s;hew Their Innocence here, as I have al|ready done for the <HI>Jewes</HI> their Neighbours: and &s;hall ground my Defence of them, upon what I have found written, in the Preface of a certaine <HI>Per&s;ian A&s;trologer,</HI> tran&s;lated into Hebrew by Rabbi <HI>Chomer,</HI> a Modern Au|thor: and I &s;hall adde to his Rea&s;ons, what

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. _THe Ignorance of the Langua|ges hath been the Occa&s;ion of &s;o many Errors, not on|ly in Learning, but even in Religion too; that it is not without cau&s;e, that Learned men complaine hereof. For what can be imagined more ridiculous, then for a man, not knowing the force of the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Rachaiah,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies no more but the <HI>Aire,</HI> or the Extent of any thing,) to fancy a Chri&s;talline Heaven?<NOTE PLACE="marg">From this pa&s;&s;age: <HI>Divi&s;it aquas quae &s;ubter Firmamen|tion, ab ijs quae &s;uper Firma|men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">um &s;unt, &amp; aquae omnes quae &s;uper Caelos &s;uut:</HI> it hath been concluded, either that there were waters above the Heavens, or el&s;e that there were certaine Chri&s;talline Heavens.</NOTE> What Gro&s;&s;er Conceit can there be, then, for want of under&s;tanding the Equivo|call meaning of the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Keren,</HI> which &s;ignifies both a <HI>Horne,</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> or
<PB N="84" REF="63"><HI>Brightne&s;&s;e,</HI> to paint <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with Hornes; which hath beene the cau&s;e of great a&s;to|ni&s;hment, among many Chri&s;tians, and of Laughter to the Jewes, and Arabians? But my purpo&s;e here, is not to &s;hew, what Abu&s;es are crept into our Religion, meer|ly for want of the knowledge of the He|brew, or the Holy Tongue, as we u&s;ually call it: I have di&s;cour&s;ed at large el&s;ewhere upon this Particular; and tho&s;e that de&s;ire more full &s;atisfaction herein, may have re|cour&s;e to my Book intitled, <HI>Advis aux Do|ctes, touchant la nece&s;sit&egrave; des langues Orienta|les.</HI> I &s;hall only at pre&s;ent &s;hew &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;everall Errors, with which our Books are full, only for want of under&s;tanding the Text of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> aright.</P>
<P N="2">2. And of the&s;e I have heretofore ob|&s;erved above a Thou&s;and: but, becau&s;e I would avoid Tediou&s;ne&s;&s;e, I &s;hall bring in only &s;ome few; and that, only to make it appeare, that <HI>Figures</HI> are condemned without cau&s;e: and that many Conclu&s;ions are de|duced, which Sound Argumentation could not beare.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In I&s;ag. Porph.</NOTE> Thus, (to begin our Enumerati|on,) all Interpreters have rendred the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Species;</HI> whereas it ought to be rendered <HI>Specimen.</HI> For it cannot be denied, but that <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifies the <HI>Species,</HI> or <HI>Sampler;</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>Copy,</HI> or <HI>Extract:</HI> unle&s;&s;e we
<PB N="85" REF="63">&s;hould give <HI>Plato</HI> the lye, who alwayes takes <GAP DESC="foreign"> in this &s;en&s;e; as if we &s;hould interpret it, in our Language, <HI>The Copy of the Great Patterne, or Sampler.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Next, it is a manner of &s;peaking, ve|ry frequent with <HI>Plato;</HI> that when he &s;peaks of the <HI>Idea</HI> of a Man, or of a Hor&s;e, he &s;aies, <GAP DESC="foreign">: which almo&s;t all In|terpreters have corrected, though very fal&s;ly, and read <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For the <HI>Idea</HI> of a Man is properly called <GAP DESC="foreign">; on the contrary, every particular man may be called <GAP DESC="foreign">: as in Latine, every Par|ticular man may be called, <HI>Ip&s;e homo;</HI> but when we would expre&s;&s;e the <HI>Idea,</HI> we can|not doe it, but in the&s;e Termes, <HI>Ip&s;i Homo, ip&s;i Equus, ip&s;i Coelum, &amp;c.</HI> If I wrote to all &s;orts of men indifferently, I &s;hould ex|plaine my &s;elfe more fully in this particular: but &s;eeing I write not, but to the Learned only; I may pre&s;ume of their under&s;tanding me &s;ufficiently, in two words.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another Error, that is committed int the Interpreting of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> is in the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, the &s;en&s;e whereof is u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ed thus: <HI>Utr&ugrave;m Univer&s;alia cadant in rerum naturam?</HI> Namely, <HI>Whether there be any Univer&s;als in the World, or not?</HI> whereas they &s;hould rather &s;ay, <HI>Utr&ugrave;m realiter &s;ub&s;i&s;tant?</HI> or el&s;e; <HI>Utr&ugrave;m &s;int realia?</HI> that is to &s;ay,
<PB N="86" REF="64">whether they have an exi&s;tence reall, and of them&s;elves; or not. There being no &s;mall difference betwixt the&s;e two Propo|&s;itions; <HI>Utrum univer&s;alia exi&s;tant?</HI> and, <HI>Vtrum &s;ub&s;i&s;tant per &s;e?</HI> which was the Opi|nion of <HI>Plato.</HI> And upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, there is likewi&s;e another Error committed in the&s;e words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">&V;trum Vniver|&s;alia in nudis tan|tum con|ceptioni|bus po&s;ita &s;int <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Vtrum&s;int &s;ecun|dum in|tentiona|liter; &s;ive per &s;olam cogitatio|n&egrave;mentis?</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">: which is rendered; <HI>whether Univer&s;als have their being onely in Little thoughts.</HI> Whereas in &s;ound Philo&s;ophy, and according to the Text, it &s;hould have been propo&s;ed in the&s;e words: <HI>whether Univer&s;als exi&s;t only by the Reflection of the under&s;tanding?</HI> Which is &s;aid to be, <HI>a Fine, Small Thought:</HI> and &s;o the que&s;tion is, <HI>An &s;int realiter, aut per Intellectum?</HI> And we are to note, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, is ve|ry properly rendred, <HI>Small Thoughts;</HI> or <HI>Conceptions;</HI> becau&s;e the &s;econd Thoughts are Le&s;&s;er, and Finer then the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. Interpreters have likewi&s;e rendered the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Avul&s;a, et di&s;tracta:</HI> as if we were not to &s;eek after the Propriety of language in all things; and di&s;cour&s;ing of a Philo&s;ophicall point, were not to handle it in Philo&s;ophicall Termes. Who can then imagine otherwi&s;e, but that this Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;hould be rendered in Latine, <HI>Ab&s;tra|cta;</HI> and that &s;o much the more happily too, in that it is a Terme &s;o frequent both among
<PB N="87" REF="64">Philo&s;ophers, and Divines? Adde to the Former, this other Error al&s;o; that the Common &s;ort of Philo&s;ophers &s;ay, that, <HI>Accidens dicitur in Quale:</HI> whereas <HI>Porphy|rius</HI> affirmes, that it is not onely &s;poken <HI>in Quale,</HI> but in <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Qomodo &s;e res habet.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;ay. c. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> Certainly it would &s;hew very &s;trangely, if when it is demanded, <HI>Qualis e&s;t Imperator?</HI> What manner of man is the Emperor? it &s;hould be an&s;wered; <HI>Bene &s;e habet:</HI> He is in very good health. Neither is there any Lan|guage in the world, that can beare this con|&s;truction.</P>
<P N="6">6. Againe, where <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> in the be|ginning of his <HI>Predicaments,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, &s;ayes, <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Interpreters generally render it, though extreamly ill, <HI>Ratio &s;ub|&s;tantiae:</HI> for, <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifies, <HI>E&s;&s;entia;</HI> &s;o that they ought to have &s;aid; <HI>Ratio E&s;&s;entiae,</HI> that is, <HI>The rea&s;on of the E&s;&s;ence,</HI> or, <HI>The Defi|nition;</HI> which is the true, and onely Rea&s;on of every thing; and the Learned know, that the &s;ub&s;tance onely of any thing is not defi|ned, but the E&s;&s;ence of it. This Excellent Philo&s;opher hath another manner of Phra&s;e, which we frequently meet with, in his writings, which is; <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is al|wayes tran&s;lated, <HI>Quod quid erat e&s;&s;e;</HI> but &s;o Ob&s;curely, that, be&s;ides that it is no very good Latine, it is a tran&s;lation that was never
<PB N="88" REF="65">yet under&s;tood by any man. It is therefore an intollerable Over&s;ight, that is here com|mitted in the Greek Text, in not taking this Verbe of the infinitive Mood, (e&s;peci|ally where the Article is expre&s;&s;ely added to it,) for a Noune &s;ub&s;tantive. So that I ap|peal to all Learned men, whether the&s;e Greek words ought not rather to be rendered thus: <HI>Quid e&s;t E&s;&s;entia?</HI> for <GAP DESC="foreign">, is as much as, <HI>E&s;&s;entia;</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Quid e&s;t?</HI> And although that <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ignifies <HI>erat;</HI> this manner of &s;peak|ing is notwith&s;tanding very Elegant, to u&s;e the Preterimperfect Ten&s;e, for the Pre&s;ent: in like manner, as in French we may u&s;e the Infinitive Mood, with an Article, in&s;tead of a &s;ub&s;tantive, thus: <HI>Ce que e&s;t l' E&s;tre de la chose:</HI> That which is the E&s;&s;ence of the Thing. It is al&s;o a very con&s;iderable Error which is comitted in the&s;e two words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign">, which are u&s;ed by the Philo&s;opher in the &s;ixt of his <HI>Moralls;</HI> for, almo&s;t all our Moderne Philo&s;ophers confound them: and becau&s;e that each of them may &s;ignifie both <HI>Agere,</HI> and <HI>Facere,</HI> this Conclu&s;ion is drawn from thence, namely, <HI>Artes e&s;&s;e Practicas:</HI> Notwith&s;tanding that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> teacheth us expre&s;&s;ely, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> is u&s;ed onely, in di&s;|cour&s;ing of Morall Actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib <HI>6.</HI> Moral.</NOTE> of Vertues, or Vices. In the &s;ame chapter, you may ob&s;erve al&s;o another Error our Philo&s;o|phers
<PB N="89" REF="65">are fallen into; who thinke, that <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifies onely, an Exterior, &s;en&s;ible Work: whereas <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elfe &s;ayes, that, <GAP DESC="foreign"> is onely to do &s;ome Worke, that hath an Externall End.

For the Soule is not this <HI>Conti|nuall motion,</HI> but onely, <HI>The Perfection from whence this Motion proceeds:</HI> and this is the meaning of the Word, <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P N="7">7. And now of late, another new Error, as great as any of the re&s;t, is &s;prung up, from the mi&s;under&s;tanding of another Text of <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> and it is grounded on the Word <GAP DESC="foreign">. For whereas <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>4.</HI> Met. c. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE> in the <HI>Cap.</HI> 4. <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Meteor,</HI> &s;ayes, <HI>Humidum facillim&egrave; alieno termino terminari,</HI> or is, <GAP DESC="foreign">: there are &s;ome, that conclude from hence, that Fire is moi&s;t, becau&s;e it is <HI>Ea&s;ily</HI> bounded by another Thing. The di&s;cour&s;e intitled, <HI>Les The&s;es Curieu&s;es,</HI> publi&s;hed &s;ome yeares &s;ince by one that was a &s;ouldier of <HI>Provence in France,</HI> and be&s;ides, an Excellent Philo|&s;opher, hath &s;ufficiently confuted this Po&s;iti|on. We &s;ay therefore only here, that which is mo&s;t true; namely, that where <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="66">u&s;eth the word, <GAP DESC="foreign">, which Interpreters render, <HI>Perfacil&egrave;;</HI> it &s;hould be tran&s;lated, <HI>Naturaliter.</HI> Now that Fire cannot Natural|ly be Terminated by Another thing, is mo&s;t certainly proved by the experience of Ca|nons, and other Fire-Engines: for the Fire being &s;hut up, or Terminated by them, either breaks them in pieces, or is broken it &s;elfe. So true it is, that one onely word, mi&s;-un|der&s;tood, is oftentimes the cau&s;e of the de|ducing of mo&s;t Ab&s;urd Con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="8">8. Let us now returne backe againe to his Morals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mor. c. <HI>4.</HI> et I&s;ago. c. de dif|ferentia.</NOTE> where, as in divers other places, we meet with the word, <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is u&s;ually tran|&s;lated, <HI>Deus,</HI> or <HI>Dij:</HI> doing hereby no &s;mall Injury to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> in making him &s;eem guil|ty of Admitting a <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> in God.

<P N="9">9. I &s;hall adde, to the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, on|ly one more,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>7</HI> Poli|tic. c. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> which is, that where <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Politicks</HI> &s;aies, that in Ancient times they were wont to give Warriers &s;o many <HI>Lilyes,</HI> as they had obtained Victories, <HI>Stapulen&s;is,</HI> to the great Di&s;paragement of the Antiquity of the Armes of <HI>France,</HI> in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Li|lyes,</HI> corrects the Text, and reads <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Rings, Contra</HI> (as he &s;aies him&s;elfe) <HI>antiquam inter|pretationem.</HI> But &s;eeing that <GAP DESC="foreign"> was the Old Word, by his owne confe&s;&s;ion, let any man judge, whether this <HI>Capriccio</HI> of his be to be endured, or not.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee whether the Judgment of the world hath been more upright in this Par|ticular Point we now treat of; and whether our Modern Philo&s;ophers have had any good ground for their endeavouring to overthrow the power of <HI>Figures,</HI> which all the Ancients allowed them, or not.</P>
<P>They therefore fir&s;t of all urge this <HI>Max|ime,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="67">which is indeed generally received by all Learned men; namely that, <HI>Quantitas per &s;e non agit:</HI> Quantity, of it &s;elfe, is a Dead Thing, and Workes not at all. Thus a &s;tone takes no care to move it &s;elfe; unle&s;&s;e &s;ome body el&s;e move it: Otherwi&s;e <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> had not fled to his <HI>Intelligences,</HI> to give motion to the Heavens. We confe&s;&s;e therefore, that Quantity of it &s;elfe, Operates not at all: but, to proceed in the &s;yllogi&s;me, and conclude, that, <HI>Figure is Quantity;</HI> is &s;uch a thing, as Philo&s;ophy will never endure.

<P>The Conclu&s;ion which I &s;hall here lay downe, and on which the whole di&s;cour&s;e, contained in the two next Chapters &s;hall move, is this: <HI>That Figures, of them&s;elves, Operate not at all: but being applyed, or if they be</HI> Modificative, (as the School &s;peaks,) <HI>they may doe &s;omething.</HI> And this is the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> which none of his Interpreters hath hitherto had the good Fortune to apprehend.

<PB N="94" REF="68">confutes tho&s;e, that maintain, that the&s;e <HI>Fi|gures</HI> are of no force at all, then the Greeke Text it &s;elfe, (if but rightly under&s;tood,) where this Philo&s;opher &s;peaks of <HI>Quality:</HI> for, he calls it <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Facultatem, &s;eu facilitatem faciendi:</HI> the word comming from <GAP DESC="foreign">, which &s;ignifies, <HI>Facere,</HI> to doe.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_WHen I con&s;ider the wonderfull Ef|fects that are found, not onely in Plants, and in the mo&s;t &s;tupid of Living Creatures; but al&s;o even in &s;tones, and the mo&s;t rude, and unpoli&s;hed Flints that are found: I confe&s;&s;e I find my &s;elfe very much inclined to the beliefe of that, which our Halfe-brained &s;matterers in Lear|ning account Ridiculous, and Fabulous. For, who would ever have thought, that be&s;ides
<PB N="98" REF="70">tho&s;e many Wonders, which have been di&s;|covered to be in the Load-&s;tone, but in the daies of our Grandfathers, there &s;hould yet in Our Time al&s;o be found out This, in a cer|taine kind of Load-&s;tone, which is of a Mixt Colour, betwixt white and blacke, and &s;ome|thing re&s;embling that of Iron; that, if a Knife, or Needle be touched with it, it will cut, and enter into a man's body, without the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of paine at all? Which hath given occa|&s;ion to a very Learned man, who him&s;elfe al|&s;o had tried the Experiment, to &s;ay; that our Mountebanks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Card. de &s;ubtil. l. <HI>6.7.</HI></NOTE> which we &s;ee to cut, and fla&s;h them&s;elves upon their Stages in &s;uch manner, without the lea&s;t change of countenance, doe make u&s;e of this Experiment. But my pur|po&s;e here is not, to &s;et downe indifferently, what ever wonderfull effects there are found, in Stones, and in Plants: Their &s;everall Fi|gures, the power whereof we now undertake, is the only &s;ubject, which at pre&s;ent I have propo&s;ed to my &s;elfe. It is nece&s;&s;ary there|fore, for the avoyding of all Equivocation, that I make a Divi&s;ion of the&s;e Figures; their Generall name being already known.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are therefore either Naturall, Accidentall, or Artificiall: of which, this La&s;t &s;ort &s;hall be the &s;ubject of the En&s;uing Chapter, and the two Former Kinds, of This. Now, both the Naturall, and Acci|dentall,
<PB N="99" REF="70">as they are of three &s;orts; that is, Im|bo&s;&s;ed, or ri&s;ing up; hollowed, or Naturally ingraven; and only Painted: &s;o are they found al&s;o in three &s;orts of things; namely, in Stones chiefely, in Plants, and in Living Creatures: which neither <HI>Albertus,</HI> nor <HI>Ca|millus</HI> have ob&s;erved. Now there is this Difference betwixt the Naturall, and the Ac|cidentall: that the&s;e Later (&s;ay Writers) are not made to any End Propo&s;ed; whereas, on the Contrary, tho&s;e other are never produ|ced without &s;ome Rea&s;on, or other. The Accidental are produced after &s;ome &s;uch man|ner, as was that Act of the Painter; who, being not able to expre&s;&s;e, to his mind, the Foaming of a Hor&s;e, in a fury threw his Spung at his Piece, with a purpo&s;e utterly to deface it: but it &s;o happened, that, what his Pencill could not doe, his Spunge performed &s;o rarely, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any hand to mend it. This Foame then was made, without any Intention of the Painter to make it. But if I &s;hould &s;ay, there is no &s;uch mat|ter, in the Works of Nature; I &s;hould &s;ay nothing, but what were Ju&s;tifiable. For, if we are taught even by Divinity it &s;elfe, and Rea&s;on al&s;o confirmes it; that there is a Cer|taine Providence, which leads on all things to their End; and which makes nothing, but to &s;ome purpo&s;e: why &s;hould we then a&s;cribe to
<PB N="100" REF="71">Fortune, any thing that cau&s;eth us to admire the Power of God; and, to impute to Chance, things that are of greate&s;t Admiration? &s;ee|ing that, among &s;o many Leaves that are found in a Fore&s;t, there is not one of them falls, without the Will and Plea&s;ure of Him, that created them. But &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould admit, that there are &s;ome Figures Acciden|tall: we &s;hall notwith&s;tanding endeavour to prove the power of a good number of &s;uch, as mu&s;t needs be confe&s;t to be Naturall. Let us now in Order con&s;ider, both the one, and the other.</P>
<P>We have already &s;aid, that they are found in three &s;orts of things; in Stones, in Plants, and in Living Creatures. Tho&s;e that are found in Stones, are called <HI>Gamahes;</HI> a word derived, in my opinion, from <HI>Cama&iuml;eu;</HI> by which name, in <HI>France,</HI> they call all Figu|red <HI>Agats:</HI> &s;o that from this Particular name, there is now made a Generall Appellation, &s;erving to expre&s;&s;e all &s;orts of Figured Stones. To give an account now of this word, and to tell whence it is Originally de&s;cended, is &s;omething a difficult thing: no one Author that I have met with, having re&s;olved this Doubt, or indeed &s;o much as propo&s;ed it: only this one thing I do a&s;&s;uredly know, that it is no <HI>French</HI> word, but a Stranger. And I have &s;ometimes thought; that, as the Jewes,
<PB N="111" REF="71">who lived a long time in <HI>France,</HI> have left us many of their Words; (as I prove el&s;e|where:)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advis &s;ur les Langues.</NOTE> they might peradventure have left us this al&s;o: and this Conjecture &s;eemes the more probable, in that this People tra|ficks much in precious Stones. Now the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Chamaieu,</HI> may have beene corrupted from <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Chemaija,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>As the Waters of God:</HI> becau&s;e that you &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome <HI>Agats</HI> &s;treaked in &s;uch manner, as that they perfectly repre&s;ent the Figure of <HI>Waters:</HI> and the word, <HI>God,</HI> is here added, according to an Idioti&s;me, frequent in the Hebrew Tongue; which, when it is to &s;peak of any thing of Excellence, u&s;ually addes this Holy Name after it. Thus, &s;peaking of a plea&s;ant Garden, it calls it, <HI>Paradi&s;us Domini:</HI> of a great Army, <HI>Exercitus Domi|ni:</HI> of tall Cedars, <HI>Cedri Dei:</HI> of high Mountaines, <HI>Montes Dei:</HI> and &s;o of the re&s;t. The Figures then, which are repre|&s;ented on Stones, are, as we have formerly &s;aid, of Three &s;orts al&s;o: either Painted, Em|bo&s;&s;ed, or Ingraven.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Paitned ones are of two &s;orts; either Coloured, or without Colour: the Coloured, are all &s;uch as are found on <HI>A|gats;</HI> &s;uch as was that of King <HI>pyrrhus,</HI> where the Nine <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> richly apparrelled, were repre&s;ented dancing, with <HI>Apollo</HI> in the
<PB N="102" REF="72">mid&s;t of them, playing upon a Harp. <HI>Car|dan</HI> cannot believe, that this Figure could ever be &s;o exactly drawne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Card. de Subt. <HI>1.7.</HI></NOTE> by meere Acci|dent: but rather is of opinion, that it was made after this manner. Some Painter, (&s;aies he) had, long before, pictured, upon a piece of Marble, <HI>Apollo</HI> amid&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> and afterward, either by Chance, or upon &s;et Purpo&s;e, this Picture being buried in the ground, in &s;ome place where <HI>Agates</HI> were generated; the Marble was turned into Agate, and yet &s;till retained the very &s;ame Lineaments, which had beene formerly drawne upon it. A very plea&s;ant Con|ceit, this! But what would he have &s;aid, if he had &s;een that which <HI>M. de Breves</HI> hath ob&s;erved, in his Voyages into the <HI>Levant,</HI> of a Crucifixe repre&s;ented Naturally, on a Marble Stone? I have &s;eene (&s;aith this great Inquirer after Curio&s;ities,) another the like Wonder at St. <HI>George's</HI> in <HI>Venice;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">En &s;cs Relations fol. <HI>137.</HI></NOTE> where the Figure of a Crucifixe was repre|&s;ented upon a Marble Stone; but with &s;o much Life, as that you might there plain|ly di&s;tingui&s;h the Nailes, the Wounds, the Drops of Bloud, in a word, all the parti|culars, that the mo&s;t curious painter would have expre&s;&s;ed. This Crucifixe now (ac|cording to <HI>Cardan</HI>) mu&s;t needs have beene drawne upon &s;ome other kind of Stone,
<PB N="103" REF="72">which was afterwards converted into Mar|ble; which is very ridiculous: or &s;uppo&s;e, that this was not &s;ome other Stone turned into Marble; but that it had, by &s;ome Ex|traordinary Meanes, only received, and re|tained the Figure of &s;ome Crucifixe, which had been applied unto it: We mu&s;t then be forced nece&s;&s;arily to &s;ay, that all other Stones have received tho&s;e Figures, which we &s;ee perfectly repre&s;ented upon them, by the like Application: which Opinion is farre wider of Common Sen&s;e, then the Former. <HI>M. de Breves</HI> either had not ob|&s;erved, or el&s;e had forgot to &s;peake of that other <HI>Gamahe,</HI> or Wonderfull Figure, meer|ly Naturall, which is to be &s;een in the &s;ame Church, upon an Altar of Ja&s;per-coloured Marble.

And if any man have a minde to impute this, to &s;ome extra|ordinary Working of God, I &s;hall not hin|der him: as it is in like manner &s;aid of the fore-mentioned Old man at <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> which is conceaved to be the Portraiture of <HI>St. Jerome,</HI> which was thus wonderfully repre&s;ented upon the Marble, by rea&s;on of the great Devotion he bare to the <HI>Cratch:</HI> And in this &s;en&s;e, I &s;hall be able much more ea&s;ily to make good the Power of Figures, which I have undertaken to maintaine: although I &s;hall notwith&s;tanding endeavour hereafter to produce &s;uch naturall Rea&s;ons, as &s;hall confirme the truth of my A&s;&s;ertion. The &s;ame <HI>Nider</HI> reports al&s;o, that the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>de Bade</HI> had a Precious Stone, that, on which &s;ide &s;o ever you looked on it, it alwayes re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="108" REF="75">a Crucifixe, naturally figured on it. As for that other &s;trange Effect which was ob&s;erved in it, it was rather Externall, then particularly Appropriate, either to the Stone, or to the Figure. For they &s;ay, that if a woman, that had her Monethly Cour&s;es upon her, chanced to look on it, it in&s;tantly covered it &s;elfe with a little darke Cloud; which afterwards vani&s;hed by little and little.

<P N="4">4. Tho&s;e Figures that are Naturally In|graven
<PB N="113" REF="77">upon Stones, are either graved Super|ficially only; or Tran&s;parently, &s;o as the Graving pa&s;&s;es through the body. Of this la|ter kind you &s;hall oftentimes meet with &s;ome, among the heapes of hollow &s;tones, that are found in the fields; wherein you may ob&s;erve the form of a Head, by the little Holes, which repre&s;ent the Eyes, the No&s;trils, and the Mouth: and &s;ometimes al&s;o you &s;hall have of them, that have the forme of a Death's head, either of a Man, or a Hor&s;e. As for tho&s;e o|ther, which are only &s;uperficially graved, you may have &s;tore of them, among the little &s;tones on the Bankes of Rivers, and upon the Sea-&s;hore: where you &s;hall light upon &s;ome, &s;o exactly repre&s;enting the figure of &s;hells, that you would think they were the Naturall &s;hels of Fi&s;hes: and this &s;ort ought rather to be reckoned in the number of <HI>Embo&s;&s;ed-Gama|hes,</HI> then tho&s;e that are &s;imply <HI>Graved.</HI> My Brother hath &s;ometime been very diligent in &s;earching on the Sea &s;hore, and gathering to|gether what Shels, or other Stones of any ra|rity, he could meet with: and he hath pre&s;en|ted one to Mr. <HI>Frey,</HI> which perfectly re&s;em|bleth a Goat's Horne: and I am of opinion, that it is one of tho&s;e, which the Ancients called, <HI>Cornu Ammonis;</HI> as you may &s;ee in <HI>Georg. Agricola,</HI> in his <HI>Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>de Natura Fo&s;|&s;ilium.</HI> I thought at fir&s;t, when I &s;aw &s;ome
<PB N="114" REF="78">of the&s;e Stones figured like &s;hells, that they had been at fir&s;t Reall &s;hels of Fi&s;hes, which had afterward been Petrified, and turned into Stone, by the Vertue of &s;ome kind of water; they were &s;o perfectly, and exactly formed. But I have &s;ince con&s;idered, that, &s;eeing that there are found of them upon the tops of the highe&s;t Hills, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>Gama|hes,</HI> and the Workman&s;hip of Nature; which without doubt hath not produced them, but to &s;ome end; as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter. From hence you may judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Ni|lo&s;e.</NOTE> whether, or no, <HI>Gore|pius</HI> hath not good rea&s;on to reprove tho&s;e, that confidently affirme, that <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and a part of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> hath heretofore been cove|red all over with the Sea, becau&s;e that there are &s;ome of the&s;e &s;hels frequently found in tho&s;e Parts. For we may as well conclude, by the &s;ame Argument, that the <HI>Apennine,</HI> the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hils, have been &s;ome|time al&s;o overwhelmed with the Sea; which is mo&s;t Ab&s;urd: unle&s;&s;e they meane, at the Generall Deluge: but this is not their Inten|tion. Let us now come to the Figures of Plants.</P>
<P N="5">5. The mo&s;t Learned among the Natu|rali&s;ts divide them thus. A Plant, &s;ay they, is either <HI>Arbor,</HI> or <HI>Cremium,</HI> or <HI>Frutex,</HI> or <HI>Herba.</HI> A Tree is a Plant, that hath a great Trunke, or body: the <HI>Cremium</HI> hath but a
<PB N="115" REF="78">little one: the <HI>Frutex</HI> hath many: and the <HI>Her|be,</HI> is that, which at its fir&s;t Appearing out of the ground, puts forth only two little leaves. I find then, that in all the &s;everall Kinds, there is an Infinite Number of Admirable Figures, which are called by the Philo&s;o|phers, <HI>Signaturae rerum:</HI> now, One Part on|ly of a Figured Plant, and not the whole Plant, is called <HI>Signatura:</HI> or you may &s;ay, the <HI>Signature,</HI> is &s;ome certain thing in that Part. I &s;peake not here of <HI>Internall Signatures;</HI> the Doctrine of the&s;e belong to Chymi&s;ts: My purpo&s;e only is, in this place, to di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e that we meet withall in Plants, which the Ages pa&s;t have taken very little notice of. I &s;hall begin then to &s;hew, in order to the parts of Plants, what <HI>Signatures,</HI> or Marvellous Fi|gures, Nature hath produced in them.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, the Root of diver&s;e &s;orts of Plants, repre&s;enteth diver&s;e parts of Our Bo|dy: as, that of the <HI>Hermodactil,</HI> re&s;embles a man's Hand.</P>
<P>The Body, or Stocke'iis yet more Admi|rable: for whether it be in great Trees, or in &s;mall Plants, you &s;hall find Figures, that re|pre&s;ent the Parts of Living Creatures. A|mong the&s;e later, the <HI>Serpentaria major</HI> per|fectly re&s;embles the skinne of a Serpent; as doth al&s;o the <HI>Dracunculus,</HI> and the <HI>Ophio&s;co|rodon:</HI> among the Former, wee mu&s;t con&s;i|der
<PB N="116" REF="79">either the Wood, or the Barke of them.</P>
<P>In the Barke you &s;hall many times &s;ee, e&s;|pecially in that of Old Trees, many Figures, repre&s;enting diver&s;e Kinds of things, by the Various Cranies and Clifts that are in it. In young Trees, where the Barke is clo&s;er, it is figured with many little Streakes, and Lines, in the nature of Painting: and I have &s;ome|time ob&s;erved, upon the Barke of a young Cherry Tree, the figure of Little Trees laden with fruit, &s;o naturally expre&s;t, as if it had been done with a Pencill.</P>
<P>The Wood is yet more Admirable, then the re&s;t; &s;eeing that in many Trees, there is the very &s;ame Variety found, that is in <HI>A|gats:</HI> and it is not many daies &s;ince I was in|formed, that there was a Tree lately found in <HI>Holland,</HI> which being cut in pieces by a wood-cleaver, they &s;aw, in one part of it, the Figure of a Chalice; in another, that of a Prie&s;ts Albe; in another, that of a Stole; and, in a word, there were repre&s;ented very near all the Ornaments belonging to a Prie&s;t. If the Re|lation be true, we mu&s;t needs confe&s;&s;e, that the&s;e Figures could not be there Ca&s;ually, or by chance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In La|tine, <HI>A|cer;</HI> and in Flem|mi&s;h, <HI>Ma&s;aros.</HI></NOTE> But, to come to a kind of wood that is more Common; in boards of Maple, which is a wood &s;ufficiently known to every body, you &s;hall often find the figure of a Ser|pent,
<PB N="117" REF="79">of a Bird, of a Fly, &amp;c. perfectly ex|pre&s;&s;ed, by the &s;treakes of this variegated Wood. There are al&s;o &s;ome other &s;orts of Wood, that repre&s;ent &s;ome of the&s;e Figures, but not Painted, but Imbo&s;&s;ed. So, at what time I was a Student at <HI>Apt,</HI> a City in <HI>Pro|vence:</HI> very famous for the Relicks of Saint <HI>Anne,</HI> mother to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, which are &s;aid to be kept in this place; I &s;aw the Trunke of a Vine, which repre&s;ented a Man's Face, as far as the haire of the Head, &s;o live|ly, as that you might percieve the Fore-head, the Eyes, No&s;e, Eares, Mouth, Chin, all exactly formed, and in very good propor|tion. It was brought by a Vineyard-keeper, to the &s;hop of M. <HI>Roulet,</HI> a Surgeon.</P>
<P>The Branches of Plants are le&s;&s;e Con&s;ide|rable, in matter of Figures, then all the re&s;t; (though it were in Wood:) neverthele&s;&s;e you may oftentimes ob&s;erve in them, &s;ome kind of Re&s;emblances of the Fingers of a Man's hand; and of the Bu&s;hine&s;&s;e of his Haire. And this is the rea&s;on, in my opini|on, why the Poets, when they di&s;cour&s;e, in their <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> of the Transforming of Men into Trees, they &s;ay that their Fin|gers, and the Haire of their Head, were chan|ged into Branches.

<P>Now in all the parts of Plants, the Fi|gures are either Internall, or Externall on|ly; or both Internall, and Externall al&s;o. The Internall are, &s;uch as the Fruit of Pa|le&s;tine; which beares the Figure of A&s;hes within; and likewi&s;e all the &s;orts of Figures, that are found in &s;awing of Marble. The Externall are, all &s;uch as are Painted, and Coloured on the Out&s;ide of the Fruit, but <GAP DESC="missing" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> only
<PB N="122" REF="82">not at all Within; in like manner as the Ap|ple, called in <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Fambure,</HI> is; which is all &s;peckled with red &s;pots, like drops of bloud, but only on the Out&s;ide, or Rind. Tho&s;e that are both Internally, and Exter|nally Figured, are &s;uch as the Maple Wood; and many &s;orts of Stones. The Internall Figures are likewi&s;e di&s;covered, either by Any Manner of Cutting Indifferently; or el&s;e, by one certain Particular Way only. That which appeares after Any Manner of Cutting indifferently, is, as in that kind of Apple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Forn.</NOTE> which, as <HI>Nider</HI> reports, hath beene &s;een at <HI>Granada,</HI> which being cut any manner of way, did &s;till neverthele&s;&s;e repre&s;ent the Figure of a Crucifixe. That which requires One only Particular way of Cutting, is, as in the Root of Fearne; which being cut One way only, repre&s;ents an Eagle perfect|ly. I have often ob&s;erved, that an Orenge likewi&s;e &s;o cut, not a-cro&s;&s;e, but long-waies, repre&s;ents, with its kernels and little skins, an Orenge Tree laden with Orenges. It is al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the Kernels of an Apple repre&s;ent the Tree.</P>
<P>The&s;e Figures doe yet con&s;i&s;t, either in the Colour; or in the Divi&s;ion of the Parts: in the Colour; as in the flowre of the Hearb Eye-bright, which repre&s;enteth tho&s;e of an Eye: in the Divi&s;ion of the
<PB N="123" REF="82">Parts; as namely, in tho&s;e we have already &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;een the Divi&s;ion of Fi|gures: it remaines now, that we prove, that they have &s;ome Power to operate; and, that it is not in Vaine, that they are perfectly repre&s;ented both in Plants, and Stones. Pro|ceed we therefore, in the &s;ame Order we have ob&s;erved in our Divi&s;ion, beginning with the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;ay then, that the Naturall Figures, which are found in Stones, have Naturally a Power to Operate, if they be Applied: and this I &s;hall prove, by two Rea&s;ons. The Fir&s;t is, becau&s;e they are called <HI>Effectrices:</HI> and the Second is, becau&s;e we &s;ee it by Ex|perience: For we daily &s;ee, that &s;ome of the&s;e Figured Stones do Operate upon the Same Things that they repre&s;ent; as for Ex|ample, that Stone which we call <HI>Heliotropi|um,</HI> which is all &s;peckled as it were with Drops of Bloud, if applied to the part that bleeds, it &s;tops the Bloud. Others there are, that worke upon the Wound that is made by the Image they beare. So <HI>Pliny</HI> affirmes, that there is a kind of Marble cal|led <HI>Ophites,</HI> by rea&s;on of its re&s;embling the Figure of Serpents, who&s;e name it beares: which, if applied to the wound cau&s;ed by the biting of tho&s;e Venemous Creatures,
<PB N="124" REF="83">it healeth it. See his own words: <HI>Genus Mar|moris ab Ophite dictum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>36.</HI> cap. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> <HI>qu&ograve;d imaginem ho|rum Serpentum repra&s;entet; molle, candidum; nigran&s;que, durum; dicuntur ambo Serpen|tum ictus &s;edare.</HI> And here we may make This Divi&s;ion of the Figures that are found in Stones; and &s;ay, that they are of two &s;orts. The one are found in &s;ome certaine &s;tones, and are alwaies the &s;ame: and the&s;e are Natu|rally endued with very admirable Vertues. The other, are &s;uch as are not tyed to any certaine &s;ort of Stones; but are indifferently found in all; and are not indeed of &s;o great Vertue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Sub|til. l. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> as the Former. And this is the divi&s;ion that <HI>Cardan</HI> makes of them: <HI>Verum,</HI> &s;ayes he, <HI>mire qui&s;piam dubitet, vnde figure hae in Gemmis, &amp; lapidibus proveniant? neque enim credendum e&s;t omnem figuran ca&s;u contingere, c&ugrave;m lapides multi ex eodem genere ea&s;dem retineant figuras. Itaque meo judicio, dicendum e&s;t, duo e&s;&s;e Figuram &amp; Imaginum genera: alterum, quod &s;emper in ei&s;dem lapidibus apparet, et hoc a Natur&acirc; provenit; quae non &s;ec&ugrave;s ac in plantis, folio|rum et fructum numerum &s;ervat &amp; rationem. Hoc figurarum genus vim habet, &amp; aliquid &s;ignificat, &amp;c.</HI> And &s;o going on, he makes mention of a Stone, which <HI>Albertus Magnus</HI> had; that, being naturally marked with the Figure of a Serpent, had this admirable
<PB N="125" REF="83">Vertue, that if it were put in a place that was haunted with Serpents, it drew them all unto it. He &s;peaks al&s;o of diver&s;e others, that would cure the biting of Serpents, and expell their Venom. You may &s;ee diver&s;e of the&s;e admirable <HI>Gamahes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>1.</HI> loc. cit.</NOTE> in <HI>Georgius Agricola;</HI> who reckons up, what &s;tones there are, that repre&s;ent all the parts of mans body; as well as tho&s;e rare Fruits, and Plants do, which we &s;hall hereafter &s;peak of.</P>
<P>And here it is commonly objected, that it is not at all the Figure, that produceth any &s;uch effect; but &s;ome occult Quality, where|with the &s;tone is endued. For otherwi&s;e, if the Figure were Operative, one drop of Blood would &s;top Others; and a living Scorpion &s;hould cure the &s;tinging of another Scorpion: fora&s;much as there is much more conformity, and nearne&s;&s;e of Re&s;emblance, betwixt two Reall drops of Blood, or two living Scorpions, then betwixt one Pictu|red, and one living One, &amp;c. And this is the &s;tronge&s;t Objection, that our moderne Philo&s;ophers do bring, and by which they do conceave them&s;elves to have overthrown, (though they haue litle rea&s;on &s;o to do,) the Power, which the Ancients attributed to Figures.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore, to an&s;were the&s;e Objecti|ons, it is true indeed, that the bare Figure
<PB N="126" REF="84">repre&s;ented on &s;tones, hath not of It Selfe any power at all to operate, though applied; except there be &s;ome Internall, or Externall Agent, that may co-operate, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Figure; or unle&s;&s;e the matter be Proper, and Apt to operate: as, for example, a Pointed Figure wil never be able to Penetrate, though it be applyed; if it be either of &s;oft Waxe, or of Butter: becau&s;e that the Matter is not at all proper to Penetration: but the &s;ame Figure in Wood, Iron, Bra&s;&s;e, or any other hard Matter, will very ea&s;ily pene|trate. In like manner, if a Stone have not, either from the &s;tarres, or from its own Na|ture, &s;ome Quality proper to &s;uch, or &s;uch an effect; as for &s;topping of Blood, &s;ome Re&s;tringent Quality; and &s;o of the re&s;t: in vaine &s;hould we expect to finde any perfect power in the Figure. To &s;ay then, that it is (for example) this onely Re&s;tringent Quality, that &s;tops the Blood; and that the Figure of the drops of Blood, wherewith the Stone is &s;potted, and painted, is of no Con|cernment at all in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; is to fall back into the former Error: For, to what pur|po&s;e then hath Nature be&s;towed this Figure on the Stone? there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be gi|ven &s;ome kind of rea&s;on for it. If it be an|&s;wered, that Nature had no purpo&s;ed End, in giving this Figure: this were to deny that
<PB N="127" REF="84">Principle, which is generally receaved by all: <HI>Id non fru&s;tr&agrave; fit, quod Natura &s;emper facit, vel plurim&ugrave;m.</HI></P>
<P>There were indeed very good Rea&s;on to doubt of this Power, if the Marble called <HI>Ophites,</HI> (which repre&s;ents the Figures of Serpents, by who&s;e name it is called,) would cure the biting of a Dog, or of a Hor&s;e only: But &s;eeing it cures the &s;tinging of Serpents onely, and of no other Bea&s;t; why &s;hould we not attribute &s;omething to the very Figure? But to prove more forcibly, that the&s;e Figures have &s;ome Power to Operate; again&s;t the per|ver&s;ene&s;&s;e of tho&s;e that di&s;pute again&s;t it: if tho&s;e which repre&s;ent Scorpions, Serpents, Toads, do find the nature of the place Proper, and aptly di&s;po&s;ed for the &s;upplying of the Stone, or other Matter on which they are found, with a Quality, and Nutriment, agree|able to the Nature of the Thing, who&s;e I|mage they beare; the&s;e Figures will then cer|tainly be turned into Reall Serpents, Scor|pions, and living Toads, and into no other kind of Creature. So that our Philo&s;o|phers need not now vexe them&s;elves any more to find out, how, or by what meanes a Toad &s;hould come to be generated in the mid&s;t of a great &s;tone; as was that, de&s;cri|bed by <HI>Georgius Agricola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Ani|mal. &s;ub|ier.</NOTE> which was found within a Mil-&s;tone, when it was crackt, or
<PB N="128" REF="85">broken in pieces, either by the force of the Venom, or el&s;e by the Violence of the Mo|tion: and al&s;o how that Other was generated, which <HI>Goropius Becanus</HI> &s;aw at <HI>Anvers,</HI> which was found in the Sawing in two of a very thicke Marble Stone, that had neither Hole, nor Rift in it. For, the Figure of a Toad having beene fir&s;t repre&s;ented within the&s;e Stones, it &s;o came to pa&s;&s;e, that by &s;ome Property of the Place, it was afterward chan|ged into a Naturall, Living Toad. And the very &s;elfe &s;ame may happen in any other Figures, except that of Man; who&s;e Fa|bricke is from the hand of God alone. We may conclude therefore that the&s;e Figures are not repre&s;ented in vain, both on Stones, and on other things: &s;eeing that if they be Rightly Applyed, they a&s;&s;uredly have &s;ome Secret Power, according to the Principle before laid down. And here I had almo&s;t forgotten to informe the Reader, that, with|out &s;earching after any forraine Examples, we may dayly &s;ee, at the Plai&s;teries at <HI>Ar|gentueil,</HI> the like Toads, and other &s;uch Creatures, engendred with Stones, and the very hart of the harde&s;t Rockes. I con|ceave therefore, that after the very &s;ame wonderfull manner of Generation, tho&s;e fi&s;h|&s;hels al&s;o, which are found on the tops of Mountaines, are produced: not in the Sea,
<PB N="129" REF="85">(as &s;ome Ridiculou&s;ly have imagined;) but upon the very place where they are found: which gave occa&s;ion to that Curious Inqui|rer into the Secrets of Nature, to draw from hence this Conclu&s;ion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorop. in Nilo&s;c.</NOTE> <HI>Ubicunqu&egrave; igitur humor, &s;ive liquor invenitur, ad Te&s;taceorum vitam idoneus, viva Te&s;tacea generantur.</HI> He &s;peaks this in di&s;cour&s;ing of diver&s;e &s;everall Figures, or <HI>Gamahes,</HI> that he had &s;een, in di|ver&s;e places: and then he goes on, and &s;ayes further; <HI>Opifex enim progeditur e&ograve;, quoad ejus materia patitur, ultr&agrave; progre&s;&s;urus, &s;i loci &amp; materiae inopi&acirc; non excluderetur.</HI> If a Figure then have &s;o much Power, as to change it &s;elfe into that Living Creature that it repre&s;ents, (provided that it meet with no Impediment;) how can it be de|nied, but that they al&s;o have the Power to Worke, by &s;ome &s;ecret Sympathy, (if ap|pled,) upon the Wound given by the Crea|ture, which they re&s;emble?</P>
<P N="7">7. Now, why the &s;ame Figure &s;hould not rather hurt, then heale a wound &s;o given; &s;eeing that the Living Creature it &s;elfe be|ing Venomous, its Figure al&s;o, &s;hould by Sympathy be Venomous, rather then Hea|ling: the Rea&s;on, I confe&s;&s;e, is very Darke, and hard to be given: neverthele&s;&s;e I &s;hall here adventure, the Fir&s;t, on this di&s;cove|ry; no man, that I know of, having as yet undertaken it.</P>
<PB N="130" REF="86">
<P>We have therefore &s;aid before, that, when the Figure of a Scorpion, (for example,) being repre&s;ented on a Stone, findes in the place where it is, any Nutriment, or Hu|mour, agreeable to the Nature of a Living Scorpion; it by little and little acquires Per|fection, and having at length drawn forth all that which was proper for a Scorpion, it becomes a Living Scorpion. Wee do al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that when this Venomous Crea|ture, or a Serpent, Dog, or any other Bea&s;t chanceth to bite any; they leave an Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Particular Quality be|hind: as we &s;ee in tho&s;e that are bitten by a <HI>Tarantuba,</HI> who pre&s;ently fall into a conti|nuall Agitation; (not that they continually Daunce, as the generall Talke is:) this Ve|nomous Creature having this Quality, that it is alwayes in continuall motion; and though it be cut into many &s;mall pieces, yet it will not leave &s;tirring a long time after. And &s;o likewi&s;e <HI>Pomponacius,</HI> and <HI>Campanella</HI> af|firme, that if a Mad Dog bite a Woman with child,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De In|caut. De &s;en&s;. rer.</NOTE> if there be not &s;peedy Remedy u&s;ed, the Fruit of her Wombe will be for|med in the &s;hape of a Dog, and it will after|wards come into the World, with all the Liniaments of a Dog. So true it is, that if we &s;hould but inquire into the Effects of Nature, and &s;hould be able to yeeld the rea|&s;ons
<PB N="131" REF="86">of them; we would &s;corne all that we think we now know. Now I &s;ay, that the Figure of a Scorpion, that is Naturally re|pre&s;ented on a Stone, is &s;till endeavouring is own Perfection; and where ever it meets with any &s;uch Qualities, as are Proper to it &s;elfe, it attracts, and draws them to it. If therefore the Figure of a Scorpion, be ap|plied to a Wound made by a Scorpion: it there findes the Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome cer|taine Quality, made by a Scorpion: which, finding to be Proper and Agreeable to its own Nature, it attracts and retaines with it &s;elfe: &s;o that the Wound, being thus de|livered of the&s;e Qualities that envenomed it, pre&s;ently heales up, and growes well again. In a word, the Stronger here prevailes a|gain&s;t the Weaker: &s;o that in the Figure of a Scorpion, which nature hath repre&s;ented on a Stone, there being greater Store found of the Qualities proper to this Creature, then there is in the Wound which the Scorpion made; tho&s;e which are here, are drawn forth by tho&s;e other, which are in the Stone, as being the &s;tronger, and of greater Vertue. Upon this Principle al&s;o it is, that a Scor|pion brui&s;ed to pieces, and applied to the Wound, cures it; as doth al&s;o its Oyle. The biting of the Serpent is al&s;o healed, by the applying of its head, beat in pieces; or
<PB N="132" REF="87">el&s;e, by the Serpent it &s;elfe, reduced into Powder; as <HI>Crollius,</HI> and <HI>M. du Che&s;ne, S. de la Violette,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De &s;ign. Plant. En la Re|formation de The|riaques.</NOTE> affirme: as likewi&s;e that of a Crocodile, is cured by its Fat: that of a Rat, by its Fle&s;h made into Powder; that of a Dog, by its Haire, or Skinne: the Ve|nom of a Toad is cured by a certaine Stone, that is found in its Head: And if we &s;hould &s;earch after the Properties of other Living Creatures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toads|&s;tone.</NOTE> we &s;hould doubtle&s;&s;e finde the &s;ame thing in all of them. Upon this Prin|ciple al&s;o it is, that if an Egge that is frozen, be put into Cold Water, it will be thawed in a very &s;hort &s;pace: and Hands, that are benummed with cold, will pre&s;ently become unbenummed, if they be put into cold Wa|ter, or into Snow-broth. For, the Grea|ter Cold, which is in the Water, finding the Le&s;&s;e, which is in the Hands; it draws in forth, and &s;wallows it up; ju&s;t as a &s;mall Candle is lo&s;t, if it be placed neer a great Fire, or a Red-hot Furnace. But if the Cold, that is in the Hands, were greater then that in the Water; and the Venom, that is in the Wound made by a Scorpions Sting, were more Powerfull, then that of the Scorpions Figure applied to it; wee &s;hould then &s;ee a clean Contrary Effect.</P>
<P>To go on then in our An&s;wer to the Ob|jection propo&s;ed, I &s;ay thus: We deny not,
<PB N="133" REF="87">but that there is a greater Corre&s;pondency betwixt two Reall, Naturall drops of Blood; and betwixt Two Living Scorpions; then betwixt a Living one, and a Painted. Yea, we rather, on the contrary, acknowledge; that the great Analogy, and Re&s;emblance that there is betwixt them, is the cau&s;e that Blood, either broken into little pieces by &s;tirring, or fre&s;hly drawn, and applied to a Wound, &s;tops the bleeding of it; as Experience te&s;tifies, if we may believe <HI>Crollius:</HI> and the Oyle of Haires di&s;tilled, keepes the Haire from falling off: &s;o Earth-wormes, made into a Powder, de&s;troy tho&s;e that are bred in Our Bodies: and the Gravell of the Urine wee make, is an excellent Medicine again&s;t the Stone: and many other Properties there are ob&s;erved to proceed from this Analogy, or nearene&s;&s;e of Re&s;emblance.

<P>Tho&s;e then that are found in Fi&s;hes, are, Characters, Ciphers, or all kinds of Armes: &s;uch as were figured not many years &s;ince, upon a Fi&s;h, who&s;e Picture was publickly &s;old up and down, though it was infinitely corrupted from the true &s;hape of the Fi&s;h it was made for. There are &s;ome other Marks, or Figures, that are le&s;&s;e corrupt|ed, which have been found upon Fi&s;hes; &s;uch as are tho&s;e, which are &s;et down in a Book, intitled <HI>Prophetia Halieutica,</HI> the Au|thor whereof was one <HI>Raphael Eglin,</HI> Mini|&s;ter of <HI>Zurich.</HI> Of the Three Fi&s;hes then,

<P>The Figures, that are found upon Bea&s;ts of the Land, are better known, then tho&s;e upon Fi&s;hes: for it hath been often ob&s;er|ved, that the Hornes of Deer have been Marked with certain Characters; and &s;ome|times too, even with the &s;hapes of Living Creatures, which have been perfectly re|pre&s;ented by them. So we have &s;ometimes &s;een Cats, and Hor&s;es, which have had upon their skins &s;uch &s;pots of White, Red, or Black, that by the intermixing of the &s;treaks of the &s;everall-coloured haire, there hath been repre&s;ented the Figure of another Cat, or Hor&s;e. And if we did not de|&s;pi&s;e, what&s;oever we account to be either Feidiculous, or of Little Con&s;ideration; we &s;hould not be put to the trouble of making
<PB N="143" REF="92">&s;o many &s;trange Inquiries, which are often|times more Vain, then Profitable.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the Figures which are found upon Rationall Creatures, are &s;uch as the Ima|gination of the Mother, during the time of her Going with Child, hath imprinted there. And here I could enter into a Large Di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the Secrets of the&s;e Figures; which are not Commonly known: but, for brevities &s;ake, I &s;hall only give the Reader here one or two Remarkable Ex|amples, which prove very powerfully the Vertue, which we attribute to all Figures. A Si&s;ter of mine had the Figure of a Fi&s;h upon her Left Leg, cau&s;ed by the de&s;ire my mother had to eat Fi&s;h, when &s;he was Great: and it is repre&s;ented with &s;o much Perfection, and Raritie, that you would take it to be drawn by &s;ome Excellent Ma&s;ter. Now That, wherein the Wonder lies, is, that when ever the Girle eat any Fi&s;h, That upon her Leg put her to a &s;en&s;ible pain. And I had a Friend, that had a Mulbery growing upon his Forehead; cau&s;ed like|wi&s;e by his Mothers Longing after them: and he never eat Mulberies, but that his own on his Forehead put him to pain by it's Extraordinary Beating.</P>
<P>This other Story, which I &s;hall not re|late, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, is very well known
<PB N="144" REF="93">to all in <HI>Paris,</HI> that are Curious Inquirers after the&s;e things. The Ho&s;te&s;&s;e of the Inne in the Suburbs of St <HI>Michael,</HI> at <HI>Bois de Vincenne,</HI> who died about two years &s;ince, had likewi&s;e a Mulbery growing upon her Lower Lip; which was &s;mooth, and plain, all the year long, till the time that Mulbe|ries begin to ripen; at which time, Hers al|&s;o began to be red, and to &s;well more and more, ob&s;erving exactly the Sea&s;on, and Na|ture of other Mulberies, and comming at length up to the Ju&s;t Bigne&s;&s;e, and Redne&s;s of other ripe Mulberies.

<P>_THere is nothing in the whole bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of Philo&s;ophy, that hath more perplexed our new Philo&s;ophers, then this Subject, concerning Images, or Figures, made under &s;ome certaine Con&s;tellations. The greate&s;t part of them therefore have rejected the Practice of the&s;e Operations, as Vaine, and Super&s;ti|tious: yet &s;ome others, who are not &s;o over|&s;wayed with Pa&s;&s;ion, have both allowed, and defended it; though they have, I confe&s;&s;e,
<PB N="148" REF="95">&s;uffered for it, in their repute: in&s;omuch that <HI>Galeottus,</HI> who is acknowledged by <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> to have been one of the mo&s;t Learned, and Knowing men of his time; only for ha|ving undertaken the Defence of this Truth, (as we &s;hall make it herea&s;ter appeare,) hath been handled by &s;ome, like any ba&s;e, Incon|&s;iderable Fellow; and <HI>Camillus</HI> accounted no better, then an Athei&s;ticall Wretch. And this is the u&s;age they be&s;tow upon all the A|ble&s;t Men: whereas they ought rather to an|&s;wer their Arguments pertinently, and to &s;hew the In&s;ufficiency of them, if they can: but &s;ee the Mi&s;chiefe of it. If any of the&s;e men chance to be in company, where there is any mention made of the mo&s;t Able Schol|lers, or there be any Que&s;tion &s;tarted, con|cerning any of tho&s;e Choy&s;e Points of Lear|ning, for which the&s;e men have been De&s;er|vedly ranked above the Herd of Vulgar Braines; you &s;hall have &s;ome giddy-headed fellows, that will not &s;tick to &s;ay, without blu&s;hing, that they never wrote any thing of any worth at all, nor ever under&s;tood the matter they handled.

In the fir&s;t place there|fore let us con&s;ider their Name.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are called in Hebrew <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Maghen,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a Scutcheon, or Sheild: in Chal|die, Aegyptian, and Per&s;ian, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>T&s;ilme|naia,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Figure, or Image: in Arabicke <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Talit&s;man,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>T&s;a|limam:</HI> and in Greek, <GAP DESC="foreign">. The Hebrew word <HI>Maghen,</HI> though it &s;ignific a Scutche|on, or any other thing, noted with Hebrew Characters, the Vertue whereof is like to that of a Scutcheon: and although the&s;e Chara|cters, according to the Opinion of tho&s;e that are mo&s;t ver&s;ed in the&s;e Theologicall My&s;te|ries, are &s;Ome kind of Imperfect Images; yet notwith&s;tanding the word in this place is not properly taken for an Image that is Graven, carved, or painted; becau&s;e that the Jewes, in making any &s;uch, &s;hould have &s;inned a|gain&s;t the Commandement: <HI>Thou &s;halt not make to thy &s;elfe any graven Image.

The Chaldie word, <HI>T&s;ilmenaija,</HI> comes from the Hebrew <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>T&s;elem,</HI> which &s;ignifies an I|mage: and the Arabick word, <HI>Tali&s;man,</HI> may likewi&s;e have been derived from the &s;ame root; <HI>Tali&s;mam,</HI> being corrupted from <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>T&s;alimam,</HI> by the Tran&s;po&s;ition of one letter only:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nat. in Flav.

Neither &s;hall I &s;peak at all of tho&s;e Images of Waxe, which Sorcerers are wont to baptize, in the name of <HI>Beelzebub;</HI> the&s;e are Abominations, which we abhor, although let me tell you by the way, that the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e things our Demonographers &s;tuffe their writings withall, are nothing but meer Fables, as ridiculous as the Dreames of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Our Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall onely be, what Naturall Power Images, that are made under certaine Con&s;tellations, may have; bani&s;hing from hence all Operations of <HI>Demons,</HI> or Spirits, and all &s;uper&s;titious Pow|ers what ever.</P>

<P N="6">6.

I &s;hall then prove this Vertue, by an Induction of that, which Re|&s;emblance alone produceth, throughout all Arts and Sciences, as <HI>Divinity, Philo&s;ophy, Phy&s;icke, A&s;trology, Phy&s;iognomy, Divi|nation of Dreames, Painting, Sculpture, Mu|&s;icke, &amp;c.</HI></P>

So if the Mother in the Act, either &s;trongly Fancy Robbing, Killing, or Love, the Child will be either a Theefe, Murtherer, or an Amorous per&s;on: if &s;he fancy Travelling, he will be a Traveller; if Dancing, or playing on the Lute, he will be very Apt for The&s;e Things; and &s;o of the re&s;t.

Being therefore in the company of &s;ome Abbots, we were brought to the Chamber where he was: who, as &s;oon as he perceived us, came to us and intreated us to have a little patience, til he had ended a little Note, which hee was writing to <HI>Cardinall Magaloti.</HI> When we were &s;ate down, we ob&s;erved him oftentimes to make certain wry <HI>Faces;</HI> which we conceived to proceed, either from folly, or el&s;e from &s;ome Pain, that the Violence of the Torments, which he had endured, put him too: the calves of his Legs being all beaten black and blew, and his buttocks ha|ving hardly any Fle&s;h on them; it having beene torne from him piece-meale, to the end they might force him to confe&s;&s;e the Crimes that he was accu&s;ed of.

<P N="14">14. The Art of <HI>Divination of Dreames</HI> is al&s;o grounded upon Re&s;emblance, as may appear out of the Holy Bible;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. <HI>40.</HI></NOTE> where <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> foretold the Cupbearer, that within three dayes he &s;hould be re&s;tored to his office a|gain: becau&s;e he had dreamed, that he pre&s;|&s;ed three clu&s;ters of grapes into <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Cup. But he foretold the Baker, that after three dayes he &s;hould be hanged, and his Fle&s;h &s;hould be eaten by the birds of the Air; becau&s;e that He al&s;o had dreamed, that he bare three baskets full; and that the birds eat up all that was in them. He foretold al&s;o the &s;even years of Plenty, and the &s;even years of dearth, by the &s;even Fat Kine, and the &s;even Lean Ones; and by the &s;even Full ears of Corn, and the &s;even Thin ones; ac|cording as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had dreamed. Prophane Hi&s;tories al&s;o affoard us many Examples of this kind, proving the power of Similitudes. For <HI>Hecuba,</HI> being with Child, dreamed that &s;he was delivered of a Firebrand, which burnt up her Kingdome: and this was <HI>Paris,</HI> who was afterwards the cau&s;e of the burning of <HI>Troy</HI> down to the ground. I &s;hall here adde moreover, that this Re&s;emblance of Dreames hath oftentimes been &s;o powerfull,

<P N="15">15. <HI>Painting</HI> and <HI>Sculpture</HI> do al&s;o won|derfully confirme this Power of Figures; for as much as tho&s;e that are Sad, and Wee|ping Pieces, do make us &s;o &s;ad, as that they &s;ometimes draw Tears from our Eyes; and the Merry, and Cheerfull Pieces, make us Joyfull, and cau&s;e us to laugh.

<PB N="179" REF="110">both of our Redemption, and of his Love towards us, who being Immortall, would yet become Man, that &s;o he might be in a Capacity to Die for Us; it al&s;o moves us, by the Vertue of Re&s;emblance, to be &s;ad, as It is: &s;o great is the power it hath over us. <HI>E&s;t e|nim Similitudo,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Porta, pictus &s;ermo, vel pictura loquens, quae quovis &s;ermone, quibu&s;ve notis Valentior e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. La&s;tly, the &s;ecret Vertues of Re&s;em|blance, and of Figures, appear as well in <HI>Mu|&s;icke,</HI> as in any other of the Sciences.

<P>It now remaines, that we prove this Pow|er to be Naturall, by the Third means which we propo&s;ed; namely, by the Vertue of the Stars. And this we &s;hall very ea&s;ily be able to doe, after we have fir&s;t &s;hewed the man|ner, which the more Learned &s;ort do ob|&s;erve,

<P N="17">17.

This being fir&s;t propo&s;ed, they then &s;earch after the Meanes, that may be proper for the attaining to the End Propo&s;ed: as, for Ex|ample, for the Cure of the Drop&s;ie, it is to be con&s;idered, that the Di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in Moi&s;ture: they are therefore not to take any Matter indifferently, for to ingrave, and forme, under &s;uch and &s;uch Con&s;tellations; but it mu&s;t be &s;omething, that is of a &s;ub|&s;tance Naturally Hot, and Dry.

For, as the Curing of the Biting of a Viper, they mixe &s;ome of Its fle&s;h, with the Antidote; in like manner, for the expelling of the&s;e Wate|ri&s;h Humors, we mu&s;t make u&s;e of that Star, which hath the greate&s;t Affinity with the Wa|ters.

Now that the Signes have more Agreement with, and have &s;tronger Influence upon one part of the body, then another; we are certainly taught by daily Experience, in the curing of Wounds. We mu&s;t al&s;o have regard, if it be po&s;&s;ible, to the Stars to which the Sicke per&s;on is &s;ubject: and then in the la&s;t place, we mu&s;t above all things take care to begin our Work, under &s;ome certaine A&s;|pects, which are only u&s;eful in the Operation, &s;ome for to &s;hed their Influences with more Heat, or Cold; and others, with le&s;&s;e; as oc|ca&s;ion &s;hall require. So that all things being thus diligently ob&s;erved, the Beames of the
<PB N="183" REF="112">Stars, finding a Figure aptly di&s;po&s;ed for the receiving them, do make &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion in it, by the Re&s;emblance and Harmony that they there find, as that being once taken in, they doe afterwards Operate on that which they finde to be &s;emblable. In all the other Operations, they proceede after the &s;ame manner: as, for Example, to cha&s;e away Scorpions out of any place, they take the Signe, with which they have &s;ome Corre|&s;pondence; &s;uch as is the Signe <HI>Scorpio:</HI> then doe they take &s;ome Malignant &s;tarre, which is Adver&s;e to them; it being not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve &s;o many rules in Bea&s;ts, and o|ther Irrationall Creatures, as in Men. Now when the Figure of a Scorpion is thus pre|pared, the Living Scorpions feeling natu|rally the Offen&s;ive Influence, wherewith the Image is indued; they pre&s;ently avoid the place, for their owne pre&s;ervation; or el&s;e, if they be too neare it, they pre&s;ently dye. If it be thought by any a Hard thing to con|ceive, how the&s;e Living Creatures &s;hould have any &s;en&s;e of this Influence; let them but con&s;ider, that there are &s;ome Per&s;ons that beare &s;o &s;trange a hatred to Cats, or o|ther like Bea&s;ts, as that if there be any with|in the hou&s;e where they are, they doe pre|&s;ently fall into a Sweating, and Trembling, although they &s;ee them not.

<P N="20">20. The other Point, concerning the Re&s;emblance of the Heavenly Con&s;tellations to Sublunary things, is &s;omething more Dif|ficult to prove, though not le&s;&s;e True: Neverthele&s;&s;e this objection is brought again&s;t it. If the Con&s;tellations of the <HI>Ramme,</HI> the <HI>Bull,</HI> the <HI>Twins,</HI> &amp;c. do re|&s;emble the&s;e Living Creatures; it is either Really, or el&s;e by Imagination. If Really; they are then, either in the Eighth Sphear, or el&s;e in &s;ome other: but they are not in the Eighth. For, in the Con&s;tellations of the <HI>Ramme,</HI> the <HI>Bull,</HI> &amp;c. there is no &s;igne at all of the&s;e Bea&s;ts being figured, or repre&s;ented by the Stars: neither are they in the Chri&s;taline Heaven; nor yet in any of the Sphears of the Planets: for we &s;hould then &s;ee them, as we do the other Starres: nor yet in a Ninth Heaven; as &s;ome have thought. If they are only by Imagination, then are their Effects
<PB N="192" REF="117">al&s;o Imaginary, and have no Truth in them; and &s;o, by con&s;equence, the Power of <HI>Ta|li&s;mans,</HI> or Figures, is Vaine.</P>
<P>We an&s;were then, according to the Iudge|ment of the mo&s;t learned <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> that in truth the&s;e Images are not at all Reall: for in the Starres that make up the Con&s;tellation of the <HI>Ramme,</HI> a man may as well fancy a Hor&s;e there, as a Sheep; as I have &s;ometimes made triall. Neither yet are they altogether Imaginary, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as a <HI>Chimera</HI> is Imaginary, which never had Being in Nature: but they are &s;o ordered in the Hea|vens by our Imagination, becau&s;e that the Con&s;tellation which we call <HI>Aries,</HI> or the <HI>Ramme,</HI> hath a &s;trong Influence upon &s;heep; as <HI>Taurus</HI> hath upon Buls; and &s;o of the re&s;t. Or el&s;e the Cele&s;tiall <HI>Ramme</HI> is &s;o called, be|cau&s;e there is not any bea&s;t upon the Earth, that is more like in Nature to this Con&s;tel|lation, then the <HI>Ramme:</HI> For it renders him that is born vnder it &s;o Pious, &s;o Meek, &s;o Gentle, &s;o Courteous, that he re&s;embleth in all things the Innocent Lambe. He will al&s;o have a Hard Head, and thick Haire, curled in rings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iusphaer. c. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> like a fleece of Wooll. <HI>Vi|dimus enim</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Junctin</HI>) <HI>complures hujus &s;igni homines, capite malliari, Spi&s;sis crinibus ad modum velleris, &amp; &s;upra frontem elevatis, qua&s;i capite certarent.</HI> And the&s;e are the Na|turall
<PB N="193" REF="117">rea&s;ons, why the&s;e Cele&s;tiall Signes are called by the names of Living Creatures. One may adde to this, with <HI>Junctin,</HI> that when the Moon is in the Signe of <HI>Aries,</HI> this Signe hath then the &s;tronger Influence upon the Head of Man, and renders it &s;trong as that of this Bea&s;t: and this may be another rea&s;on, why this Con&s;tellation is called by the name of this bea&s;t, rather then of any o|ther. So in like manner, when the &s;ame Planet is in the Signe of <HI>Taurus,</HI> it hath a &s;tronger Influence upon the Neck; wherein con&s;i&s;ts the chiefe&s;t &s;trength of a <HI>Bull:</HI> when it is in <HI>Gemini,</HI> the Influence is &s;trong up|on the Armes; and for this cau&s;e, this Signe is repre&s;ented by the Image of two children, embracing one another: When it is in the <HI>Crab,</HI> the Brea&s;t is then &s;harer in its Influ|ences; becau&s;e that this Creature alwayes goeth upon its Brea&s;t: and when it is in <HI>Leo,</HI> the Signe &s;heds its Influence upon the Heart; from whence the Lion is &s;aid to be a Gene|rous and Couragious bea&s;t. You may &s;ee the re&s;t of this di&s;cour&s;e, in the &s;ame Au|thor; which I &s;hall not here trouble my &s;elfe to &s;et down, becau&s;e the rea&s;ons do not at all &s;atisfie me. I do therefore beleeve, that the&s;e Signes do ca&s;t forth their influences upon the &s;everall Members of the body, though not for the&s;e Rea&s;ons here delivered;
<PB N="194" REF="118">which often prove to be very Impertinent; but onely, becau&s;e we dayly &s;ee the Expe|rience of it. They do therefore vi&s;ibly work by their Influences, upon tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, who&s;e names they are called by: for, Dogs run mad, in the Dog-dayes; and Lions are very furious, under the Signe of <HI>Leo:</HI> and this was the Only Rea&s;on, which moved the Fir&s;t Philo&s;ophers to call the&s;e Con&s;tel|lations, by the names of the&s;e bea&s;ts: and all the other rea&s;ons that are brought, are but of Later &s;tanding, and have been inven|ted by the Later A&s;trologers. The&s;e Con|&s;tellations then are called by the names of the&s;e Living Creatures, becau&s;e that they are ob&s;erved to have great power over them. And that I may trouble my &s;elfe no further in this Particular, you may &s;ee the Abridge|ment of all that <HI>Junctin</HI> hath written hereof, in <HI>Heurnius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.

Should we exclude Gold from the number of things Natural, becau&s;e it is fa&s;hioned into a Ring? And are Stones rendered le&s;&s;e Natural, when they are framed into a Hou&s;e? If it be objected, that, howe|ver, they &s;hould not acquire thereby More Vertue, then they had before. I an&s;wer, that the Contrary is manife&s;tly proved by two Rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t is, becau&s;e that the different Figure renders them more apt to O|perate, to &s;uch, or &s;uch an Action, then they were before: as for Example, if a piece of Wood, or Stone, were unapt to hold water, by making of it Hollow, it pre&s;ently becomes Fit for &s;uch a purpo&s;e: and &s;o in other Fi|gures. The other Rea&s;on is; that the&s;e things, when they come under the Worke-man's hands, are wrought under certain Con|&s;tellations; which communicate &s;uch Influ|ences and Qualities unto them, as they never had before: as we &s;ee by Experience in Bisket bread; one &s;ort whereof will keep a very long time, and the other, that was baked either before, or after it, will be &s;ubject to Wormes,

<PB N="200" REF="121">
<P>_THe Wonderful Effects, which have been alwaies ob&s;erved to have been wrought by <HI>Ta|li&s;manicall</HI> Figures, have &s;o perplexed the minds of tho&s;e men; who account every thing to be Magicke, which them&s;elves are not able to comprehend; as that, without ma|king any Di&s;tinction at all, betwixt Power which is Naturall, and Lawfull; and that which our Faith permits us not to meddle with; they have boldly publi&s;hed, that, what Vertue &s;oever proceeds from Figures, is ut|terly Diabolicall. But when they perceived, that Knowing Men would hardly &s;it downe &s;o; and that it concerned them to produce &s;ome Rea&s;ons, to prove that the&s;e Figures can have no Naturall Power at all; they have at length brought The&s;e following ones; though they are built on very weake foundations, as we &s;hall make it appeare.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fir&s;t is, that Rea&s;on it &s;elfe tels us, that the&s;e Operations cannot be Totally Na|turall, but rather &s;uper&s;titious and Dange|rous; &s;eeing that, to reduce them to a full, and entire Effect, there are &s;ome certaine words to be u&s;ed; which have no Power at all, e&s;peci|ally over things which have no Sen&s;e; and that Therefore, the Making of them ought to be forbidden, and rejected, as the Church hath ordained.</P>
<PB N="201" REF="121">
<P>To an&s;wer fully, and in Order, both to This Objection, and to the re&s;t that follow, I &s;ay; that, in the Fir&s;t place, we are to take notice; that, in the matter of the&s;e Figures, we have already condemned all Words, and all other Super&s;titions: &s;o that, to avoid a Tedious Repetition, the Reader mu&s;t call to mind, what hath already been &s;aid to This. As for the Church, it never yet rejected the True, and Lawfull Power of Figures, &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed it: as may appeare out of the Writings of tho&s;e two Learned Men, <HI>Tho. Aquinas,</HI> and Cardinall <HI>Cajetan.</HI> And if the Fathers have &s;ometimes condemned it; it was not till they &s;aw that it was &s;o mixed with &s;uper&s;tition (that I &s;ay not, Abominati|ons) that they conceived they &s;hould never o|therwi&s;e be able to divert men from the Pra|ctice of it, but by condemning it utterly: as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> likewi&s;e did, in forbidding ab&s;olutely the Graffing on a Tree of a different kind, on|ly to keep them from that &s;inne, which was u&s;ually committed at that Action; as we &s;hall &s;hew hereafter. And that it may appear that the bare Figures have not been u&s;ed alwayes, without any Application of Words and Ce|remonies; &s;uch as were not only Vaine, but Ridiculous al&s;o; we may take notice, that in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> when they would cau&s;e Haile to cea&s;e, which might have been effected by the

<PB N="203" REF="122">hence did this Super&s;tition take Ri&s;e, of &s;pea|king Words in the making of the&s;e Figures; and afterwards, of letting alone the Figures, and u&s;ing the bare Words only: as it is re|ported of <HI>Trallianus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>19.</HI> in fine.

But at la&s;t there were &s;ome that made more E&s;teeme of Characters, then of Plain Words, con&s;idering with them|&s;elves what the power of Figures was. Thus <HI>Pliny</HI> reports,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>28.</HI> cap. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>M. Servilius</HI> made u&s;e of the&s;e two Letters, <HI>M,</HI> and <HI>A,</HI> to keepe him|&s;elfe from being bleare-eyed: and <HI>Eudoxia</HI> the Empre&s;&s;e, being in Travell with a Child, de&s;ired, (as <HI>Cedren reports,</HI>) to have certaine Letters applyed to her Belly, for to bring forth the dead Child: but it was all in vaine; for it co&s;t her her life. To conclude, the&s;e things having been invented only for the con|cealing of &s;ome Secrets, as we have &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De &s;ecret. Oper.

<P N="2">2. Now that the Practice of making the&s;e Figures was never forbidden, but only to keepe us off from tho&s;e Abominations, that were u&s;ually hereby committed, (the Inven|tion being neverthele&s;&s;e Naturall, as wee have &s;hewed; and the Things them&s;elves having beene very Innocently u&s;ed by Good Men, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other Power, &s;ave that of Nature;) wee may perceive by a like Example, in the Command that was given, of not Graffing on a tree of a Different kind. For it was given for no other Rea&s;on, (that I may here pa&s;&s;e by tho&s;e, which are brought by Interpreters, both Greeke and Latine, which are many times very wide of the Text) but only to turne away the Jewes from tho&s;e Filthine&s;&s;es, and Abominations, which they u&s;ually committed at this kind of Engraffing. The Latine words will in &s;ome &s;ort hide the Uncleanne&s;&s;e of the di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e Villanies: you &s;hall have them therefore out

<PB N="206" REF="124">have already &s;hewed. Now the rea&s;on, why they have been al&s;o rejected by &s;ome of the more Learned &s;ort, was either to give way to the Rigour of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition;</HI> as the <HI>I|talians,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have done: or el&s;e, for want of having taken the paines to ex|amine them; as <HI>Gul.

<P N="3">3.

<P>But we have already an&s;wered, in the pre|cedent Chapter, that we doe not at all de|fend the Follies of the Super&s;titious; but do rather freely condemn Their Ob&s;ervations, and all words, that tend to Super&s;tition. In the &s;ame Chapter al&s;o we have rejected part of the Fooleries, delivered by <HI>Villanoven&s;is:</HI> and, that we may not have any Scruple un|&s;atisfied, we doe al&s;o here condemn tho&s;e, which are brought by <HI>Antonius Mizaldus:</HI> as namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cent.

Sanclarus,</HI> (the Learned <HI>Re|gius Profe&s;&s;or</HI> in the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> who is yet living, and may be askt the Que&s;ton,) hath &s;worn to me, that he hath cured a mo&s;t Intollerable Paine in the Reins, by one of the&s;e true <HI>Tali&s;mans:</HI> &s;o much doth it con|cerne us to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h, betwixt the True, and Fal&s;e ones.

<P>The Third Objection is grounded, upon the Impotency of the Matter Ingraved.

<P>To this I an&s;wer, that no Image, or <HI>Tali&s;|manicall Figure</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly be Capable of o|perating &s;o Great an Effect: they may indeed po&s;&s;ibly excite, in &s;ome &s;mall mea&s;ure, the courage of Combatants, and make them le&s;&s;e fearefull of the Terrors of Warre; but the&s;e Qualities alone will never be &s;ufficient, for the obtaining of a Victory.

This Compari&s;on is &s;o much the more Pre&s;&s;ing, becau&s;e that the mo&s;t of the Learned believe, that this Vertue of the Load-&s;tone is communicated unto it, by that part of the Heavens, which the Needle points to. So True it is, that there is nothing more Powerfull, then the Influences of the Stars, when they have once made an Impre&s;&s;ion up|on things here below.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Sixt Objection &s;trikes at the Pow|er, which we have attributed to Re&s;emblance: for, there is not any where (&s;aith <HI>Guliel.

<P>I know very well, that this Author makes u&s;e of this Argument again&s;t <HI>Nectanabo:</HI> but &s;eeing that he brings it al&s;o again&s;t <HI>Tali&s;|manicall Images,</HI> I an&s;were; that the&s;e Ima|ges, (as wee have already &s;aid) have no Power at all over our Wils. Now, to Drown Ones Selfe, or, Not to Drown ones Selfe, is an Action which depends wholly upon the Will. But if a Child re&s;emble the Mother, as well in the Lineaments of the Face, as in the Actions of the Soul; there is no doubt, but that this Re&s;emblance may have very much power, both as well on the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Minde, as on tho&s;e of the Body, which proceed from within: as it is often ob&s;erved. And even in Our dayes, We have heard of two young Chil|dren, which were Brothers, at <HI>Riez,</HI> an E|pi&s;copall City in <HI>Provence</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> who by rea&s;on of their being &s;o perfecty Like One Another, if One of them were &s;icke, the Other was &s;o too: as, for example, if One began to have a Pain in the Head, the Other would pre&s;ently feele it.

<P N="8">8. The Seventh Objection, brought by the &s;ame <HI>Guliel.

<P>This Objection is an&s;wered in two words. I &s;ay then, that we have already proved, that the Stars have power to communicate this Vertue to the Stone; and al&s;o, that it is not at all Naturall to it, and proceeding from Its Own proper Vertue: becau&s;e that, before it was Figured, and prepared under certain Gon&s;tellations, it had no &s;uch Vertue at all. And indeed, to what end &s;hould a man take &s;o much paines in graving, and preparing it under diver&s;e A&s;pects of the Stars, if it had as much Vertue before? To what purpo&s;e al&s;o &s;hould the Inhabitants of the Country of <HI>Hamptz,</HI> in <HI>Turkie,</HI> trouble them&s;elves to take the Impre&s;&s;ion of a Scorpion that is figured upon a Stone in a certain Tower, in a piece of Potters Clay, if &s;o be the Clay it &s;elfe had the &s;ame Vertue before? We &s;ay therefore, that it had not Any Vertue before, Proper for &s;uch an Operation; and that this Vertue was communicated unto It, by the
<PB N="222" REF="132">Stone in the Tower; and to the Stone, by the Starres.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here examine the Arguments of <HI>Gul. Pari&s;ien&s;is,</HI> which are to be &s;een un|der the Title of the 56.

So that there is nothing want|ing now, to the full Vindication of them from Fal&s;hood, and all other Calumnies, &s;ave only to an&s;wer the Eighth Objection, brought both by <HI>Ger&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Guliel. Pari&s;ien|&s;is</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P N="9">9. And it is This; which &s;eemes to be the mo&s;t powerfull of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>If &s;o be the Stars are the cau&s;e of the&s;e Operations, why then (&s;ay they) &s;hould not their Vertue de&s;cend rather upon the Living Scorpion, then upon it's Image? <HI>Quomodo,</HI> &s;aies the Later of the&s;e, <HI>non poti&ugrave;s huju&s;mo|di virtus de&s;cendit &s;uper ip&s;um Scorpionem vi|vum?</HI></P>
<P>If we but call to mind, what hath been before delivered, we &s;hall find it no hard matter to an&s;wer this Objection. For,
<PB N="223" REF="132">we confe&s;&s;e, that the Living Scorpion is not at all Exempted from this Cele&s;tiall Ver|tue; &s;eeing that, if It be applied to the Wound, It cureth it, as well as It's <HI>Tali&s;|manicall</HI> Image: &s;o doth the Crocodile, the Rat, the Toad, the Dog, and the Viper al|&s;o. And if in all the re&s;t of Living Crea|tures we find not the &s;ame Effect; it is ra|ther for want of &s;earching after it, then a|ny Defect in Nature: &s;eeing that tho&s;e, that are mo&s;t skilled in the Wonderfull Works of God, do certainly a&s;&s;ure us, that where-ever any Di&s;ea&s;e is found, There al&s;o is the Re|medy to be had. And who would ever have thought, that the Gravell, which is found in Urine, &s;hould &s;erve for a Remedy again&s;t the Stone? and a world of other the like Secrets there are, which are daily brought to Light. But it may here be demanded; Why then &s;hould not the Stars communi|cate the Vertue of driving away Scorpions, as well to the Living Scorpion, as to it's Image?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that if it were &s;o, Nature &s;hould then make warre again&s;t It Self, and &s;hould utterly de&s;troy it &s;elf in a &s;hort time; &s;ee|ing that all Living Creatures would &s;oone be de&s;troyed by one another.

For, where he grants, that <HI>Figure</HI> is a Co-principle in Locall Motion, and in the Operations which this Motion produceth; but not in tho&s;e which are cau&s;ed by Alteration; he con|cludes again&s;t that, which Him&s;elf had be|fore laid down; &s;eeing that, according to the Common Con&s;ent of all Philo&s;ophers, Heat is cau&s;ed by Motion: but Heat is a kind of Alteration: Therefore Figure is, of It Self, a Co-Principle in the operations which are cau&s;ed by Alteration.</P>
<P>Again, when he grants to <HI>Cajetan,</HI> that a Large piece of Iron may perhaps &s;wim up|on the water; yet he &s;aies, that it is not by rea&s;on of the Figure, but of the Quantity: the&s;e are his words. <HI>Sed e&s;to, fiat; erit, non ratione Figurae, &s;edratione Quantitatis.</HI> Well; but of It Self, and in Sound Philo&s;ophy, <HI>Quantitas non e&s;t activa:</HI> See then what the Con&s;equence mu&s;t be.

<PB N="227" REF="134">to &s;wim upon the Water; <HI>Delrio</HI> an&s;wers, that this Figure is only Accidental: for, &s;aith he, let this Large, Thin piece of Iron be re|duced into &s;ome other Figure, either Circular, Square, or Five-angled, it will doe the &s;ame: that is to fay, it will &s;till &s;wim upon the wa|ter: therefore the Figure Operates not, but by Accident.

For a Flat Figure, whether it be Square, Cir|cular, Octogonall, or of what fa&s;hion &s;oe|ver it be, will doe that, which the &s;ame Fi|gure, if it be &s;olid, will not doe: which is mo&s;t True; &s;eeing that a piece of Iron that is Square, and Thicke withall, &s;inkes pre&s;ent|ly to the bottom of the water; which the &s;ame piece of Iron would not doe, were it Square, and very Thinne It is therefore a mo&s;t Undeniable Maxime, that <HI>Figure</HI> hath &s;ome Power to Operate.</P>

So the diver&s;ity of Hils, and Vallies, is the Cau&s;e of a greater either Heat, or Coldne&s;&s;e. We may al&s;o here adde an In&s;tance in pieces of Ice, which the Sun cannot &s;o ea&s;ily melt, and di&s;&s;olve, if they be Plaine, and &s;mooth; but very ea&s;ily, if they be Uneven; and Rough.

He denies then, Con&s;equently, tho&s;e Images which He made; as, the Brazen Fly, which he &s;et up, upon one of the gates of the City <HI>Naples;</HI> which, for the &s;pace of Eight yeares, kept all manner of Flies from comming into the City. He de|nies al&s;o that other <HI>Tali&s;man,</HI> of a Hor&s;eleech, graved on a Plate of Gold; which he ca&s;t in|to a Well, for to drive away the va&s;t multi|tudes of Hor&s;leeches, that annoyed the &s;ame City. In a word, he &s;tands not to di&s;pute, whether the Operations of the&s;e Images are Natural, or not: but hee plainly denies in Termes, that there was ever any &s;uch thing in the world: as if he could not by any meanes have defended <HI>Virgil's</HI> Innocence, without ea&s;ting him&s;elfe upon this Extreame, and giving the Lye to all the Authors that have reported the&s;e &s;tories. That which he &s;ayes, in the Progre&s;&s;e of his Di&s;cour&s;e, by way of confirmation of his A&s;&s;ertion, is af|ter the &s;ame Rate. For, by rea&s;on of the great number of Places, from whence the&s;e bea&s;ts are reported by Hi&s;torians to have

As if, becau&s;e of the great number of Battails that <HI>Hannibal</HI> is reported by Hi&s;torians to have fought with the <HI>Romans,</HI> we might not, by the &s;ame Rea|&s;on, doubt, whether hee fought any with them, or no. He &s;aies moreover, that <HI>Sca|liger</HI> had good rea&s;on, to make him&s;elf mer|ry with one of the&s;e Fly-drivers, who ha|ving made a <HI>Tali&s;manicall Plate</HI> for This Ve|ry Purpo&s;e; he had no &s;ooner &s;et it up, up|on one of his Windowes, but a Fly comes pre&s;ently and &s;hites upon it for Hand&s;ell. But he mu&s;t not thinke, that the&s;e Rea&s;ons of his are able to derogate any thing, from the Pow|er, which we have acknowledged the&s;e Figures to have. For, (that we may give him his An&s;wer,) if &s;uch a Phy&s;ician is not able to Cure a Sicke man; or if &s;uch an Arithmetici|an be not able to bring to an end &s;ome Opera|tion, which he hath begun: &s;hall we therefore conclude, that Phy&s;icke, and Arithmetick, are Fal&s;e and Ridiculous?

<PB N="240" REF="141">
<P N="14">14. After all the&s;e Objections, there are yet &s;ome Other may be made, which have quite e&s;caped our Criticks: I &s;hall fir&s;t propo&s;e, and then an&s;wer them; to the end I may cleare this Subject, which hath been &s;o Unju&s;tly cried down, of all Doubts, and Difficulties.</P>
<P>It may be then Objected, that, &s;eeing that, in making of a <HI>Tali&s;manicall Image,</HI> we are to grave only One Cele&s;tiall Fi|gure; the re&s;t, which &s;hould concurre in the Operation, not finding their Image there, cannot Operate at all.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is Ridiculous to grave the Figure of a Ram, a Lion, and &s;o of the re&s;t; &s;eeing that the Con&s;tellations, who&s;e names the&s;e are, do not doe the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, in the Effects which we &s;ee in Nature; but rather the Sun, pa&s;&s;ing through the parts of the Heavens.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Vertue of the Other Stars will be communicated to the Image, as well as of tho&s;e, which we chiefly de&s;ire to make u&s;e of; &s;eeing that, both the One, and the Other, do continually &s;end forth their Influ|ences: tho&s;e therefore, that are of Con|trary Qualities, will hinder the Operation of the Other.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the&s;e Figures mu&s;t needs be Su|per&s;titious, and no whit Naturall; &s;eeing
<PB N="241" REF="141">that the Figure of a Scorpion, either Ingra|ved, or Imbo&s;&s;ed, on a Stone, hath not only the power to cure the &s;tinging of a Scorpi|on, It &s;elf; but is able al&s;o to communicate This Power to Another Figure, taken from it, in a Piece of Clay: as in that we have &s;poken of.</P>
<P>To the Fir&s;t I an&s;wer, that a man may, if he plea&s;e, grave Diver&s;e Images, accord|ing to the Diver&s;ity of the Signes that he would ob&s;erve. Such a one was that <HI>Ta|li&s;manicall</HI> Stone of the <HI>Sr. de Bagarris,</HI> which was &s;een in <HI>Paris,</HI> by diver&s;e Learned Men: &s;uch a one al&s;o is one of tho&s;e Silver <HI>Tali&s;mans,</HI> that <HI>M. de Mare&s;cot,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Reque&s;ts, &s;o much honoured me, as to com|municate unto me; although I conceive it to have been made by &s;ome Super&s;titious per&s;on. For, be&s;ides the Table of Latine Cifers that you find there, and &s;ome Chymical Chara|cters; there are al&s;o three Angelicall Chara|cters, like unto tho&s;e that are found figured in a Book intituled, <HI>Les Clavicules de Salo|mon:</HI> which makes me &s;u&s;pect all the re&s;t. The Figure of a Woman, which you &s;ee on the One Side, is certainly meant for the Sign of <HI>Virgo:</HI> and the three Hebrew Let|ters, which are on the other &s;ide, <GAP DESC="foreign">, are the Abbreviatures of the&s;e three Entire words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>El ha&s;cem Echad:</HI> that is to
<PB N="242" REF="142">&s;ay, word for word: <HI>God; This Name is one.</HI> Mr. <HI>de Peyre&s;c,</HI> of whom I have formerly made mention, a man that is mo&s;t Exact and Skilfull in Matters of Antiquity, hath, among the many Rarities which his Clo&s;er affords, very many of the&s;e <HI>Tali&s;manicall</HI> Figures al&s;o; which he could not have the opportunity of conveighing to me, becau&s;e that the Intercour&s;e with <HI>Lions</HI> hath been broken off, by rea&s;on of the Sickne&s;&s;e. I may po&s;&s;ibly hereafter have the Opportu|nity to communicate them to the World. But to return to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in hand. The Influences of many &s;everall Stars may be communicated to one Sole Figure; as the Vertue of many &s;undry Hearbs, which pro|ceedeth from the &s;ame Stars, may be re|duced into one Medicine. This Compa|ri&s;on is u&s;ed by <HI>Mar&s;ilius Ficinus,</HI> who, following the opinion of the Ancients, &s;aies: <HI>Illa ver&ograve; ex quamplurimis conflari pro arbi|trio po&s;&s;unt. Ut &s;i centum Sclis, Jovi&s;que de|tes, per centum plantas, &amp; animalia, &s;imilia|que &s;par&s;ae fuerint; componere &s;imul haec cen|tum tibi comperta po&s;sis: &amp; in unam conficere formam, in qua Solem ferm&egrave;, Jovemque to|tum jam videaris habere.</HI> So that there is no great Nece&s;&s;ity that the Figures of all the Con&s;tellations &s;hould be ingraved, but only of That, which you would have to
<PB N="243" REF="142">Operate the mo&s;t Effectually. And though the Other Starres meet not with a Figure &s;emblable to their Operations; yet will they Operate notwith&s;tanding: for as much as they doe continually &s;hed forth their Influ|ences upon all things indifferently; and do communicate their Vertue to the Gold, or to the Stone; though &s;ome, more; and o|ther &s;ome, le&s;&s;e; according to the diver&s;e A&s;pects, under which they were wrought.</P>
<P>To the Second Objection I an&s;wer, in one word, that it is all one, whether it be the Twelve Con&s;tellations of the Zodiack, or the Sun in them, that &s;heds forth the&s;e Influences, &s;o that we be but a&s;&s;ured by Ex|perience, that they come from &s;uch a part of the Heavens, and that the Effect alwaies followes: we are therefore alwaies to grave &s;uch a Figure, as is Corre&s;pondent to this Effect, whether it proceed from the Sun, or from the other Stars. And yet it is Manife&s;t, that it proceeds not Principally from the Sun; &s;eeing that the re&s;t of the forty eight Con&s;tellations, which are not in the Zodiack, and through which the Sunne pa&s;&s;es not at all, do neverthele&s;le, in &s;ome &s;ort, Operate al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Third Objection is as ca&s;ily An&s;wer|ed, as the Former: fora&s;much as tho&s;e Con|&s;tellations, which are of a Contrary Nature
<PB N="244" REF="143">to the Effect which we de&s;ire, though they do Operate; yet it is but Faintly, and with Little Force: for we u&s;e to ob&s;erve the time, either when they are not in our Hemi&s;phere; or if they be, we then take them, when their A&s;pect is weake&s;t, and when a Fortunate Star accompanies them.</P>
<P>The La&s;t Objection is indeed the mo&s;t Difficult of all the re&s;t; &s;eeing that the Ver|tue, which we find Imprinted in a <HI>Tali&s;man,</HI> &s;eemes to &s;urpa&s;&s;e the Power of Nature. Neverthele&s;&s;e we are able to make it appear, that there is nothing Extraordinary in it, by in&s;tancing in the Load&s;tone; which having communicated it's Vertue to a Peice of I|ron, This Peice of Iron communicates it afterwards to Another, in drawing it to it &s;elf, and retaining it. In like manner may a <HI>Tali&s;manicall</HI> Figure communicate it's Ver|tue to Another Figure, which &s;hall have re|ceived Impre&s;&s;ion from It; which &s;hall af|terwards have the power to work the &s;ame Effects: only the Difference is, we can give a Rea&s;on of this Later, though not of the Former. For, the <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> is, as a Brick, made very hot, which is able to heat ano|ther Brick, though not with &s;o much force, as the Fire does: and the &s;ame is to be &s;aid of the Print of a <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> in Clay, which can never be &s;o Powerfull in Operation, as
<PB N="245" REF="143">the <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> it &s;elfe; which is heated, or pe|netrated, by the Beams of the Stars.</P>
<P>We conclude then, that we may Natu|rally, and without the Aid of Spirits, prove, by the Secrets of Nature, not only the Pow|er of the&s;e Images, but of many other O|perations al&s;o, which are more wonderfull. As, for Example, to &s;end Newes to our friends, in le&s;&s;e then an houres &s;pace, above an Hundred Leagues off: as <HI>Trithemius Ab|bas;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Tract. Apol. pro Societ.

To doe &s;uch Miraculous things, by the help of Looking-gla&s;&s;es, as we would think to be utterly Impo&s;&s;ible: &s;uch as were tho&s;e &s;trange Operations, which <HI>Roger Bacon</HI> undertooke to do in the number <HI>Nine;</HI> by which hee promi&s;ed the Pope, that if he would furni&s;h him with &s;uch a Summe of mony, as the Charge of making them would require, he &s;hould be able to annoy the <HI>Turkes</HI> more by the&s;e Gla&s;&s;es, then by an Army of a Hun|dred Thou&s;and Men. Briefly, if <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> had not informed us, that the Image in the Aire which in&s;eparably followed a certaine man, &s;o that he could never be rid of it, was Naturall: would it not pre&s;ently have been concluded, that it was &s;ome Familiar Spirit, or &s;ome <HI>Demon,</HI> that took upon it the Figure of this Man? And yet neverthe|le&s;&s;e,

<P>_I Do not doubt, but that, now I here undertake to prove, that the Patriarchs, and Fir&s;t Fa|thers were A&s;trologers, and Ca&s;ters of Nativities, I &s;hall be accounted a Ridiculous fellow; and that the Common Cry will be, that my Opini|ons are Wild, and Extravagant, and with|out Common &s;en&s;e. But be it &s;o; I have already endured &s;o many Calumnies, for en|deavouring but to reforme the Ignorant, as that I may very well &s;ay with the Poet;</P>

<P>All things are &s;weet un|to me, &s;o that the Truth be but knowne: and certainely my Enemies mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity leave per&s;ecuting me, unle&s;&s;e they are more &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;e then Bea&s;ts. I publi&s;h then Free|ly, and Boldly, This Curious piece of Do|ctrine, which the Ignorance of the Hebrew tongue kept a long time hid from the Chri&s;ti|ans. But &s;eeing that my Cu&s;tome alwayes is, fir&s;t of all to cleare the Subject which I han|dle, from all &s;u&s;picion; it concernes me, that, before I di&s;cover the Secrets of this A&s;trolo|gy of the Ancients, I make it appeare, that Men have, without ju&s;t Rea&s;on, or Ground, que&s;tioned the Purity of this Science; which, teaching how to erect Nativities, under the diver&s;e A&s;pects of the Stars, makes us Able to Foretell, and that by a way of Natures owne teaching, the Good, or Evill Fortune that &s;hall befall men.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e then that oppugne the Innocen|cy of A&s;trology, make u&s;e ordinarily of the&s;e two Rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, that it is Vaine, and of no Truth; and &s;econdly, that it is con|demned by the Maximes of our Religion; which requireth nothing at our hands, but
<PB N="250" REF="146">this <HI>Burden of the Cloi&s;ter; Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Humility.</HI> And if we but con&s;ult the Ca|nons, where this Decree is to be &s;een, writ|ten in red letters; you will finde, &s;ay they, that it is not without Cau&s;e, that This Art is cried down; &s;eeing it impo&s;eth a <HI>Nece&s;sity</HI> upon our Actions: and that the Principle on which it is grounded, hath been of &s;o dan|gerous Con&s;equence, as that it hath planted Idolatry in the Mindes of Men. Now if the&s;e Arguments had not been already an&s;we|red by &s;o many Authors, it would concerne me to examine them in this place: but <HI>Cardi|nall de Aliaco, Lucius Bellantius, Melanch|thon, Pirovanus, Goclenius,</HI> and <HI>Ranzovius,</HI> have &s;o judiciou&s;ly done it, to the &s;atifaction of the mo&s;t Criticall Palate, as that he mu&s;t be no Man, that &s;hall not acknowledge their Rea&s;ons to be mo&s;t Ju&s;t, and Sound. For, if the Church, &s;ay They, cannot endure the very name of <HI>A&s;trology;</HI> it is not meant of that Kind of <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> which, by the Ri&s;ing and Setting of the Stars, and by their &s;everall Conjunctions, is able to foretell Rain, Thun|der, Stormes, and Tempe&s;tuous weather, and, by Con&s;equence, the Plenty, or Scar|city of Fruits: as al&s;o, by the Nature of the&s;e Cele&s;tiall Figures, to judge of the Naturall Di&s;po&s;ition of a new born Child: as, that it will be of a Temperate Humour, if it be
<PB N="251" REF="146">borne under a Temperate Signe; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, will be al&s;o Meek, Affable, and Courteous: or el&s;e on the contrary, if it be borne under a Malignant Con&s;tellation, by rea&s;on of Its being either too Cold, or too Hot, and Parching; the Child will al&s;o a|bound with the Like Humour, and &s;o a man may proceed on in his judgement of him, and pronounce of him Probably, and without captivating the Will at all, that he will be Quarrel&s;om, and Ill-natured; and the&s;e Quar|rels being alwayes accompanied with &s;ome ill Accident, or other, one may conclude, that he will be Vnhappy, and Vnfortunate: and many the like things may be foretold, which I &s;hall here omit; becau&s;e they are &s;o common, that even Children know them. This then is not the <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> again&s;t which the Church hath given Sentence; but that O|ther Sort, which hath been Ju&s;tly condemned; which attributing more Power to the Hea|vens, then it ought to do, impo&s;eth a Ne|ce&s;&s;itie upon the Free&s;t Part of our Soule.</P>
<P>The&s;e Authors have likewi&s;e given the &s;ame An&s;were to the Fir&s;t Argument, con|cerning the Incertainty of this Art, which we have before brought to prove the Truth of the Power of Figures. We may therefore account all tho&s;e to be very Ob&s;tinate, and Self-conceited men, who, to a&s;per&s;e <HI>A&s;tro|logy,</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="147">do reckon up all tho&s;e <HI>A&s;trologers</HI> of note, that have been found Liers: whereas they &s;hould al&s;o as well have produced the names of all tho&s;e that have hit right, and who&s;e Predictions have even a&s;toni&s;hed all tho&s;e, that have &s;eene the Event to follow. So, the great <HI>Picus Mirandula,</HI> who, for writing again&s;t <HI>A&s;trologers</HI> more, and more reproachfully, then ever man did, was cal|led <HI>Flagellum A&s;trologorum,</HI> met at la&s;t with one <HI>Lucius Bellantius</HI> of <HI>Syena,</HI> who was not at all deceived in his judgement that he gave upon his Nativity: for he foretold him, that he &s;hould die in the Thirty fourth year of his Age; which accordingly came to pa&s;&s;e. And did not <HI>Junctin,</HI> an <HI>Italian,</HI> of the City of <HI>Florence,</HI> foretell, that Him&s;elfe &s;hould die of &s;ome Violent Death, and upon the very &s;ame day was knocked on the head, by his Books in his own Study falling upon him? But that we may not weary our &s;elves, in turning over bookes, in &s;earching for Exam|ples of this Kind, even our owne Country of <HI>France</HI> will be able to affoard us enough, and he mu&s;t have been a blind man, that hath not ob&s;erved them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Certainly the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Truths prevailed &s;o much upon the Minds of the mo&s;t Learned men, that lived in the days of our Fathers, that without any making Doubt,
<PB N="253" REF="147">or Scruple at all, they put Pen to Paper; imploying their mo&s;t precious hours of Stu|dy, in Confirmation of what their Prede|de&s;&s;ours had herein delivered: addicting them&s;elves &s;o much the more freely to this kind of Study, for that they &s;aw it was a&s;|&s;erted al&s;o, even by the mo&s;t pious Doctors of the Church. <HI>Dama&s;cene,</HI> &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dama&s;c. <HI>2.</HI> lib. de Fide.

<P>And fir&s;t, that I may cleare the&s;e Se|crets from all manner of Su&s;pition, it will concern me, in few words to &s;hew, that there can be nothing more Fal&s;e, then what is u&s;ually given our, to the Di&s;paragement of this our A&s;trology; namely, <HI>That the Beginning of It, hath given Ri&s;e to Idolatry.

The Second is, becau&s;e that their Children practi&s;ed it, and were Blamele&s;&s;c.

<P>As for the Fir&s;t, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> affirmes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Adam and Seth,</HI> were the Fir&s;t that practi&s;ed this Science; whether it were in them, Infu|&s;ed, or Acquired: and that <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he fled into <HI>Egppt,</HI> taught it the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> This Truth hath &s;o much the more Force in it, in that it proceeds from a man who&s;e Au|thority is Unque&s;tionable.

<PB N="258" REF="149">the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> or el&s;e, as others will have it, the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> were the Inventers of it: yet &s;till will it be true, that the <HI>Patriarks</HI> were the Men; fora&s;much as, <HI>Abraham</HI> was an <HI>A&s;&s;yrian;</HI> and his Predece&s;&s;ours were <HI>Phoeni|cians;</HI> a <HI>Colony</HI> of <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> having gone into <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> as we have el&s;ewhere proved.

<P N="4">4. The &s;econd Rea&s;on is grounded upon All Story, both Sacred, and Profane: where any one may &s;ee, that there are very few Ages pa&s;&s;ed, wherein there was not &s;ome Great Per&s;onage that was Famous for his Knowledge in <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> without being con|demned for it by any.

But to return to <HI>Bechai.</HI> That which he ob&s;erves of the&s;e Fir&s;t Men; and, which, I &s;ay, hath been ob&s;erved by no man el&s;e, is; that tho&s;e Fires which they made, in honour of the Sun, and Moon, were Lawfull, and Kindled to a good End.

<P N="8">8. This Opinion of the Learned Jew may be proved, by two, or three Conclu|&s;ions. The Fir&s;t is, that the Wi&s;e men of the Former Ages had knowledge of the Invi&s;ible God, by the Things that are Vi|&s;ible. Now of the things that are Vi&s;ible, there is none that more powerfully proves, that there is a God, then the wonderfull Ef|fects of the Sun, and Moon, and the re&s;t of the Stars. They had knowledge of God therefore, by the Stars. And whereas the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, that though they knew him, yet they glorified him not afterwards; he &s;peaks of tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, which had knowledge of him only by this Naturall way: But the Fir&s;t <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> be&s;ides this way of Knowledge, had knowledge of
<PB N="269" REF="154">him al&s;o by Revelation. It is Probable then, that this Later way, joyned with the Former, brought them to a ju&s;t acknowledg|ment of Him; which they expre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e Fires, which they kindled in Honour of Him. Another Conclu&s;ion is, that the&s;e <HI>Chaldeans</HI> had not as yet dealt with Spirits: and although that, after the Floud, a great part of this People, whom the Pride of <HI>Cham</HI> had corrupted, had addicted them&s;elves unto them; yet notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t part &s;till kept them&s;elves to the Lawes of their Fathers; and would not acknowledge any other <HI>Demons,</HI> &s;ave tho&s;e Spirits, which they conceived to have their Re&s;idence in the Stars. But I &s;hould perhaps be thought to talk Idly, with this Rabbin, had I no other Proofes of this, but what I have out of his Schoole.

<P N="4">4. The Fir&s;t is, that &s;eeing that before the time of the&s;e Rabbins, no man ever made mention of this In&s;trument; and that, before the&s;e men gave us the De&s;cription of it, the Doctrine, on which it was built, was known; it is Probable, that it was invented after|wards, upon this Doctrine. The Second is, that <HI>Rabbi Kapol,</HI> who was a very Learned A&s;trologer, makes not any mention at all of
<PB N="278" REF="159">it, in any of his A&s;trologicall writings; as neither hath <HI>Abraham Avenar;</HI> nor, before Them Both, <HI>R.

<P>The La&s;t Conjecture, which makes me thinke, that this In&s;trument was never in u&s;e, among the Ancient Hebrewes, is, becau&s;e that the Names of the Moneths, which are graved on the Circle of the Moon, are not Hebrew, but Chaldee: and although &s;even of the&s;e names are to be found in the He|brew Bible, which are the&s;e; <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Ni&s;an, Sivan, Elol, Ki|&s;leiu, Tevet, Schevat, Adar;</HI> MARCH, MAY, AUGUST, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER, JANUARY, &amp; FEBRUARY; yet are they not therefore Hebrew; for they are no where found, &s;ave only in the Bookes that were written, during the Captivity; as <HI>Haggai,

<P N="5">5. The Figure of <HI>Ahaz</HI> his Diall is more certaine; or rather, is le&s;&s;e &s;u&s;pected of Novelty: but that the Fabricke of it, as it is delivered to us, is entirely perfect, and &s;uch as it was Anciently, I finde not many Rea&s;ons to induce me to beleeve. For as much as, except only one Rabbine, who is indeed a very Learned man, I have not met with any Hi&s;torian, either Chri&s;tian, He|brew, Aegyptian, or Arabick, that hath taken any notice of it, or &s;o much as touched upon

Eliahou Chomer,</HI>) that &s;hall com|municate it to the world: and it was after this manner. A Stone, or el&s;e a Plate of
<PB N="281" REF="160">Copper, of what Bigne&s;&s;e a man plea&s;ed, was wrought into the Forme of a Cre&s;cent; the hollow part whereof encompa&s;&s;ed a Ball, or Globe, of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, having the houres of the Day de&s;cribed upon it. This Globe, or Ball, was compa&s;&s;ed with a Cir|cle, which was rai&s;ed above it about two In|ches, and had 28. holes bored in it; which &s;erved to &s;hew the Houres, as well by the Moon, as by the Sunne; in this manner. The In&s;trument was placed upon a Pede|&s;tall, or el&s;e upon a Window only; (as <HI>Chomer</HI> &s;aith, That of this Kings was:) but in &s;uch a manner, as that one of the Hornes of the Cre&s;cent, which was to be fitted to the Elevation of the Place, mu&s;t re&s;pect the Ea&s;t; and con&s;equently, the Circle, that cro&s;&s;ed it, would look toward the South. When the Sunne then &s;hone, it ca&s;t a &s;hadow towards the Oppo&s;ite Horne; &s;o that, the &s;hadow falling upon the Round Ball, the height whereof exceeded not that of the two Hornes of the Cre&s;cent, it &s;hewed exactly the houres, till about Ten of the Clocke, (according to our manner of reckoning the houres:) at which time the Sunne, being too high, could not ca&s;t the &s;hadow any lon|ger upon the &s;ide of the Horne: &s;o that, for the following Houres, this Defect was &s;up|plyed by the Circle; which &s;hewed the
<PB N="282" REF="161">houres, till about Two in the Afternoon. After which time, as the Sunne declined, the other Horne of the Cre&s;cent began to &s;hew the houres, till Night. And thus, of the Twelve houres of the Day, the Circle al|wayes &s;ehwed foure of them; that is to &s;ay, from Ten, to Two in the Afternoon: and this Part of the Day is &s;till called, by the Ea&s;terne men, <HI>Mid-day,</HI> or <HI>Noone;</HI> dividing the Day naturally into three parts; <HI>Morn|ing, Noone,</HI> and <HI>Evening;</HI> as having long &s;ince lo&s;t the u&s;e of Dials; as <HI>Scaliger</HI> hath ob&s;erved. As for the houres of the Night, they were found out upon this In&s;trument, by the Moon; by ca&s;ting its &s;hadow upon a little Pinne of wood, wherewith one of the Holes of the Circle, round about which the Howres were de&s;cribed, was to be &s;topped every day: So that this Pinne which appea|red on the top of it, &s;erved in&s;tead of a Stile, or Cock of the Diall; which the Greeks call <GAP DESC="foreign">. If I had not found &s;ome Difficulty in this Ob&s;cure De&s;cription, I would have here &s;et down the figure of it, and the man|ner how this Diall is to be made. But I had rather be &s;ilent, in things that I doe not fully under&s;tand, then to &s;peake by ghe&s;&s;e: &s;ome better lea&s;ure may perhaps giveme Oppor|tunity, to di&s;cover This Secret, and to com|municate it to the world.

<PB N="283" REF="161">only adde, that <HI>Jonathan's</HI> Paraphra&s;e calls this In&s;trument, whether it be a True one, or not; <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>T&s;ourat Aeven Scha|gaja; Figura Lapidis Horarum.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_BUt that we know, that in point of Learning, e&s;pecially when it is of any Antiquity, and of a Na|ture &s;o Quaint as this is, it is very Hard to di&s;cover all the Secrets of it, with|out encountring al&s;o with many Vanities, it mu&s;t appeare very &s;trange, that I &s;hould here reject, what <HI>Scaliger</HI> chiefly, (a man who hath been de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t Learned of our Times,) hath laid down for Truth, in the traditions of the Ea&s;tern Peo|ple. But they, who have read tho&s;e Books, that beare the&s;e Titles, <HI>De fuga Mariae: De ge&s;tis Jo&s;eph: Hi&s;toria Regum: Sortes Apo|&s;tolorum,</HI> and many others the like, may ca|&s;ily be able to judge, that &s;eeing the Mo&s;t Holy things cannot make their pa&s;&s;age, through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of Many Ages, with|out being mixt with many Vaine, Fabulous Stories; it is no Marvell, that Tho&s;e Things, that are of a Lower, and more Indifferent Nature, &s;hould not be able to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves in thier Originall Purity. The A&s;tro|logy of the Hebrewes had not as yet lo&s;t any of its Lu&s;tre, &s;o long as it was practi&s;ed by tho&s;e of That Nation Only: but &s;o &s;oon as the
<PB N="286" REF="163">more Northern Nations began to have a|ny knowledge of it; they pre&s;ently fell to vanting of &s;uch Strange, Wild Fancies, and to increa&s;e the Number of Fables in &s;uch &s;ort; as that it is no Marvell, that this Science hath beene &s;ince &s;o much cried downe. I hold it therefore Nece&s;&s;ary, before I de|&s;cend to that which we have of Puritie, and Truth, in this Science, to give a Touch fir&s;t at That which is Fal&s;e, and Corrupted. And this we &s;hall doe, if we but &s;et down part of that, which hath been written of this Subject, by the afore-named <HI>Scaliger, Riccius, Kun|rath, Vigenere,</HI> and <HI>Duret;</HI> it being an ea&s;ie matter afterwards for any man, to di&s;cover the like impo&s;ture, in all the other Authors, which are le&s;&s;e Con&s;iderable. The Fir&s;t, Second, and third, of the&s;e above-named, doe unju&s;tly attribute to the Jewes &s;uch a kind of A&s;trology, as they never were ac|quainted with: the Fourth will needs have them to have acknowledged, in the Secrets of this Science, Certain Spirits; which never had any Being, &s;ave only in his own Fancy: and makes them to have been the Authors of a world of Fopperies, which have been forged by the Greeks, and Latines, upon this Subject: And the La&s;t of them makes &s;uch a Strange, Wild thing, of the whole Doctrine of it; and &s;ets it forth in &s;o Gro&s;&s;e, and Ri|diculous

<PB N="297" REF="168">Hawke upon his Right Hand, and in his Left a Flaile. In the Fifth, two Men; one eleving wood with a Hatchet; and the o|ther, bearing a Scepter in his hand. The re&s;t of the Degrees have their &s;everall Figurs al|&s;o; which I &s;hall pa&s;&s;e by, that I may come to the &s;econd Signe, which is <HI>Taurus:</HI> into the Fir&s;t Degree whereof when <HI>Mercury</HI> en|tered, they pictured a Man, holding a Cud|gel in his hand, with which he drives an Oxe to the Shambles. In the Second Degree, a Woman, holding in her hand a Hor&s;es taile. In the Third, an Old Woman, covered with a Vaile; or el&s;e a Woman in Breeches. In the Fourth, another Woman, holding a Whip. And that I may trouble my &s;elfe no further in reckoning up all the&s;e Figures, the Reader may &s;ee them, if he plea&s;e, in the fore&s;aid Booke; where <HI>Scaliger</HI> &s;aies, that he hath taken them out of the Writings of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and that the&s;e kinds of Pictures were in u&s;e among the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> But, (with all Re&s;pect to &s;o great a Scholler be it &s;po|ken) I mu&s;t take leave to &s;ay, that he was ne|ver &s;o farre wide of the Truth, as Here: and if any be &s;o Curious, as to de&s;ire to be &s;ati&s;|fied in this Particular, he may be plea&s;ed to take notice, that <HI>Scaliger</HI> hath tran&s;cribed them word for word, out of a Second Book of a Worke entituled <HI>A&s;trolabium Planum,</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="169">where they are all repre&s;ented, by Figures cut in Wood, and are the Invention of <HI>Pe|trus Aponen&s;is,</HI> otherwi&s;e called, the <HI>Concilia|tor:</HI> being the very &s;ame, which he cau&s;ed to be painted, in the Great Hall of the Palace of <HI>Padua,</HI> where they are yet to be &s;een.

I &s;hould not have here made this Ob&s;ervation, but only that I might be the better able hereafter, to make knowne the Vertue of the A&s;trology of the Ancient <HI>He|brewes;</HI> which was, in a manner, the &s;ame with that of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and the more Learned among the <HI>Arabians:</HI> out of who&s;e Bookes, <HI>Scaliger</HI> vainely &s;aies, that he hath be&s;towed much paines in collecting the &s;aid Figures. For there hath long &s;ince been &s;uch a World of Strange things, which ne|ver had Being, foi&s;ted upon this Science; that people generally now adaies &s;ticke not to &s;ay, to the great Di&s;advantage of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> that
<PB N="299" REF="169">there is no Truth, or Certainty in the&s;e kind of Studies. I thinke it nece&s;&s;ary therefore, for the better Informing of tho&s;e, who are thus abu&s;ed, to declare, what it was that mo|ved <HI>Aponen&s;is,</HI> to repre&s;ent the&s;e different Po|&s;tures of Men, Women, and diver&s;e kinds of Living Creatures. This Learned A&s;tro|loger having ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e that are borne under certaine Conjunctions of the Planets with the Signes of the Zodiack, were alwayes inclined to one and the &s;ame thing: as, for example, the Planet of <HI>Mars</HI> being the A&s;cendent in the Fir&s;t Degree of <HI>Aries,</HI> tho&s;e that are then borne, are commonly Labori|ous, and lovers of War; he figured a Man, as we have &s;aid, holding in one hand a Sickle, which &s;ignifies Labour; and in the other a Bow, the Hieroglyphicke of War. In like manner, tho&s;e, that are borne, when the &s;ame Planet is in the Second Degree of the &s;ame Signe, are Quarre&s;ome, and Envious, as Dogs: and this made him repre&s;ent a Man with a Dog's head, holding a Cudgell in his hand. The Figure of the third Degree, &s;hews that the Child will be a lover of Peace. The Fourth, that hee will hardly be Rich, &s;cattering about what hee &s;hall have gotten, which is &s;ignified by the Flail, and the Hawk. When <HI>Mercury</HI> is found in the Fir&s;t Degree of <HI>Taurus,</HI> the Child will be addicted to
<PB N="300" REF="170">Blood, and Butchery: and therefore he &s;igu|red a Man with a Cudgel, driving an Oxe to the Slaughter-hou&s;e. If in the Second De|gree, he will be given to Idlene&s;&s;e; as the Woman, that holds a Hor&s;-taile in her hand. If in the Third, a Woman will de&s;ire to mar|ry in her Old Age, and endeavour to be thought young; according to the Figure of the Old Woman, that is covered with a Vaile, or el&s;e wearing a Paire of Breeches. If in the Fourth, the Child will be Quarrel|&s;ome; which is &s;ignified by a Woman, figu|red with a Whip in her hand. And &s;o of all the re&s;t, as you may &s;ee in the Author him|&s;elfe. We may conclude then, that the&s;e A&s;trologicall Devi&s;es are no more of the <HI>He|brewes,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> inventing, then the <HI>Brazen Hor&s;e</HI> is of mine.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t then, the Ancient <HI>Hebrewes</HI> repre&s;en|ted the Stars of Heaven, either All Together, or &s;everally, by the Letters of the Alphabet; in the &s;ame manner expre&s;&s;ing, and di&s;tingui|&s;hing them, as we do, by the names of <HI>Aries, Taurus,</HI> &amp;c. And when all the Letters of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Alphabet, or what other &s;oever they were, (for I &s;hall cleare this Doubt &s;ome o|ther
<PB N="304" REF="172">time,) were ended; they then went onto expre&s;&s;e the re&s;t of the Stars by Two Letters together; by this means, making up a Word: to which al&s;o they added a Third Letter; the more perfectly to expre&s;&s;e the nature of the Star, or Con&s;tellation. And perhaps a man may be able, by this Doctrine, to put an end to that Long Di&s;pute, that hath been rai&s;ed, concerning the Signification of tho&s;e names of Stars, which we meet with in the Bible: as, for Example, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Ahs,</HI> in <HI>Amos;</HI> which is In|terpreted, <HI>Arcturus;</HI> or, as <HI>Aben-E&s;ra</HI> will have it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 11.6 <HI>Thren.</HI> 2.3.9. <HI>Dan.</HI> 7.5</NOTE> <HI>Vr&s;a.</HI> Now we know very well, that <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Ahs,</HI> &s;ignifies not <HI>Vr&s;a,</HI> neither in the Ho|ly Scriptures, nor in any other Author: but, the name of this Bea&s;t in Hebrew, is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Dob;</HI> as you may &s;ee in <HI>I&s;aiah, Jeremiah,</HI> and <HI>Da|niel.</HI> The&s;e two Letters therefore, <GAP DESC="foreign">, joy|ned together, might perhaps be only the bare Characters of the Con&s;tellation of <HI>Vr&s;a Ma|jor.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. And by this we may &s;ee, that the Anci|ent <HI>Hebrewes</HI> fancied not the Figures of any Living Creatures in the Heavens, as we do.

The Ancient Hebrewes, I &s;ay, took no notice of all the&s;e Particulars; neither did they admit of any Di&s;tinction of Signes Humane, and Bruti&s;h; Double, or Single; Right, or Crooked; Terre&s;triall, or Aquaticke; Fruitfull, or Barren; Strong, or Weake; Lying, or Standing; Seeing, or Hearing;

<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, <HI>Reading</HI> pre&s;uppo&s;eth &s;ome Vi|&s;ible Signe; whether it be in Letters, Chara|cters, Markes, Ciphers, Staves, Torches, Darts, Javelins, Knots, Streakes, Co|lours, Holes, Points, Living Creatures, or any other Sen&s;ible thing. Now all the&s;e Figures, or Signes, may be repre&s;ented in the Clouds: and the Reading of them may be performed, three manner of wayes. Either by Letters, or Knowne Characters; or by Hieroglyphickes; or la&s;tly, by Signes, or Markes, which doe repre&s;ent Per|fectly, and not Ob&s;curely, that which we read. For, the&s;e Signes are different from
<PB N="338" REF="189">Hieroglyphickes, in this; that Hierogly|phickes doe repre&s;ent things Ob&s;curely; as, for Example, expre&s;&s;ing a Battail by a Sword: but the other contrary wi&s;e, Clearly, and Plainly; as namely, one Battail, by a|nother. Now all the&s;e Letters, Markes, and Hieroglyphicks, are repre&s;ented not only in the Clouds, but &s;ometimes al&s;o in all the o|ther Meteors; as Comets, Lightning, Raine, Haile, Snow, Manna, and White Fro&s;ts; as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter. We begin with the Clouds.</P>
<P N="2">2. The mo&s;t Intelligible Signes, Marks, or Characters, that are figured in the Clouds, are Armed Men, On&s;ets, Armes, and Battels; which appearing in order, for many daies together, do give notice to Men, of &s;ome &s;emblable Event to follow. Now whe|ther the&s;e Prodigies proceed from &s;ome Na|turall Cau&s;e, or el&s;e are produced by the pow|er of Almighty God, for to admoni&s;h us of our &s;ins; we &s;hall examine hereafter: but this is mo&s;t certaine, that we never faile of &s;eeing the Event to an&s;wer the Sign; and that to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of all tho&s;e men, who would reduce all things, to the Principles of Phi|lo&s;ophy. About twenty foure yeares before the Birth of our <HI>Saviour Chri&s;t,</HI> there were two Armies &s;een to encounter each o|ther, in the Aire; and that with &s;o great vi|olence,
<PB N="339" REF="189">as that men might heare (if at lea&s;t the &s;tory be true,) the Running of their Hor&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. T. Liv. l <HI>2.</HI> Decad. <HI>1.</HI> Plutarcb. in Vit.

Not long after, was the truth of this Vi&s;ion made manife&s;t to the world. For <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Sylla,</HI> by their Factions, making, as it were, a Shambles of the Feilds; were the cau&s;e of &s;o much Blood&s;hed, as that the Romans never received a greater Blow, then This. In like manner, when the <HI>Gothes, Hunnes,</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> invaded <HI>Ita|ly:</HI> the <HI>Europeans, Pale&s;tine;</HI> and the <HI>Turks, Con&s;tantinople;</HI> there were &s;een in the Aire, Armes all bloody; Men, raging like Mad; and Dogs, &s;o feirce, and cruell; as that the very De&s;cription is full of Horror. But, that we may not borrow Examples abroad; it is reported, that in the yeare 1561. the like Prodigies were &s;een in our owne Country of <HI>France,</HI> and even in the City of <HI>Paris</HI> al&s;o; which, not long after, &s;uffered under an infi|nite number of Calamities. Of late yeares al&s;o, while the King continued his Seige be|fore <HI>Montauban,</HI> there appeared, at <HI>Caen,</HI> at the beginning of the Night, very many Dreadfull Sights in the Aire. A City &s;eemed to be be&s;eiged, Ordnance planted, Souldiers drawne forth, and the Clouds moving for|ward and backward, appeared like to two pitched Battels, that &s;tood ready to charge
<PB N="340" REF="190">each other: and that which cau&s;ed the great|e&s;t Terrour in the Beholders, was, that the&s;e Figures &s;eemed to be all bloody, and, as it were, Inflamed; and the Face of the whole Heavens al&s;o was mo&s;t dreadfull to behold.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Hieroglyphicks, and Letters that are &s;eene in the Clouds, are more Fre|quent then others, though not &s;o certaine. And, becau&s;e people doe not much take care to ob&s;erve them, I doubt not, but if I &s;hould here &s;et down, what I my &s;elfe have &s;ome|times &s;een in the Clouds, I &s;hould be laughed at; notwith&s;tanding, the Con&s;ideration of The&s;e Things ought not to be rejected, by tho&s;e that are Curious; as we &s;hall &s;hew here|after. For, be&s;ides tho&s;e wonderfull Ef|fects, which Philo&s;ophers have ob&s;erved doe happen daily in the Clouds, it is al&s;o an Ad|mirable thing to &s;ee,</P>

<P N="3">3. Let us now proceed to the Con&s;ide|ration of the&s;e Prodigies; and di&s;cover, whether there be any Secret meaning in them, or not.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e men that are of opinion, that the&s;e &s;trange Sights in the Clouds are not Acci|dentall, and have no Signification in them, endeavour to prove their A&s;&s;ertion by the&s;e three Rea&s;ons. The Fir&s;t is, becau&s;e their Ge|neration is wholy above the Power of Na|ture; &s;eeing that no man can a&s;&s;igne any Na|tural Cau&s;e for it. The Second is, becau&s;e that their Duration is much different, from that which Philo&s;ophy alloweth them. For; if we con&s;ider the Figure of a Cloud, we &s;hall finde, that it cannot pre&s;erve it &s;elfe, in the &s;ame Form, and bigne&s;s, the &s;pace of one hour only; but is pre&s;ently &s;cattered, and changed into &s;ome other &s;hape, very much different from the former. But as for the&s;e Prodi|gious Figures which we &s;peake of, they have been &s;ometimes &s;een to la&s;t, for the &s;pace of forty dayes; as the Author of the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> te&s;tifieth; who reporteth
<PB N="342" REF="191">this wonderfull &s;trange Story,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> Mac|cab. c. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> here follow|ing. <HI>Eodem tempore Antiochus &s;ecundam profectionem paravit in Aegyptum. Conti|git autem per univer&s;am Jero&s;olymam civita|tem, videri diebus quadraginta, per ae~ra, Equi|tes di&s;currentes auratas &s;tolas habentes, &amp; ha&s;tis, qua&s;i cohortes, armatos, et cur&s;us equo|rum per ordines dige&s;tos, et congre&s;&s;iones fieri comin&ugrave;s, et &s;cutorum motus, et Galeatorum mul|titudinem gladijs di&s;trictis, et telorum jactus, et aureorum armorum &s;plendorem, omni&s;que generis loricarum.</HI> A like Prodigy happen|ed to the &s;ame City, a little before the utter De&s;truction of it by <HI>Titus,</HI> &s;on to the Empe|rour <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian;</HI> who was the In&s;trument of puni&s;hing the Inhabitants thereof, for com|mitting the mo&s;t Horrid Crime, that ever the Sunne beheld. For, there were &s;een at that time, for above a whole daies &s;pace; Ar|mies of men, running up and downe in the Clouds:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo&s;eph. de Bel. Jud. l. <HI>7.</HI> c. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> and Chariots likewi&s;e; the very &s;ight whereof a&s;toni&s;hed the Beholders. The Third Rea&s;on, to prove that the&s;e Figures are not Accidentall, nor produced by the Power of Nature only, is; becau&s;e that the Praiers of Godly men have oftentimes been the cau&s;e, that there have appeared in the Clouds, the Figures of Angels, and of Saints, who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance hath been implored, in &s;ome Calamitous Times: as <HI>S. Cele&s;tine</HI>
<PB N="343" REF="191">was &s;een at <HI>Aquileia;</HI> and <HI>S. Petronia,</HI> at <HI>Bologne.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But tho&s;e, who are of a Contrary O|pinion, bring Arguments again&s;t the former; and maintaine; that there is nothing &s;een in the Clouds, but what may be Naturall. For, as concerning the manner how the&s;e &s;trange Sights are generated, it is every whit as much knowne to us, as that of Comets; which are often ingendred in various, and &s;everall &s;hapes; as, Pointed, Round, Long, Large, and in the Figure of Haire; accor|ding as the Matter is Di&s;po&s;ed. In like manner may the Body of a Cloud be for|med by the Wind, which carrieth it to and fro, into ten thou&s;and &s;everall &s;hapes, which appear &s;trange to our &s;ight; though, in them&s;elves, they are cleane otherwi&s;e. And thus the Fir&s;t of the afore-&s;aid Rea&s;ons is overthrowne.</P>
<P>The Second &s;eemes to have much more Force; but in Truth, hath none at all. For, though the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> &s;ay, that the&s;e Fearful Sights of Armies appeared in the Clouds, for forty daies together; yet it doth not &s;ay, that they were Really &s;uch; but only, that they Appeared to the Behol|ders, to be &s;uch. Now their Sight might be deceived, by a &s;trong Imagination, cau&s;ed from having &s;een it once; as it often hap|pens,
<PB N="344" REF="192">in the like ca&s;e. If it be Objected, that though one Single man might have been de|ceived; yet, that Many could not po&s;&s;ibly: and that therefore, the &s;ame thing having been &s;een by All, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be Reall, and not Imaginary. To this I an&s;wer, that Many may be deceived, as well as One &s;in|gle per&s;on; &s;eeing that the Imagination of Many is altogether as &s;trong, as that of a &s;ingle per&s;on; and be&s;ides, that if the Cloud, wherein the&s;e Figures appeare, be Thick, and Moi&s;t; the Raies of our Eyes, being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by our Imagination, may ea&s;ily think they &s;ee, that which we fancy to our &s;elves. This An&s;wer is &s;et downe more ful|ly by <HI>Pomponatius;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De In|cant.</NOTE> who, treating of &s;o dif|ficult, and bold a Subject as this; might have cleared him&s;elfe of the Objections made a|gain&s;t it, by u&s;ing another Rea&s;on, (which we &s;hall produce hereafter,) which is both ea&s;ie, and better knowne; without ca&s;ting him&s;elf upon the Maximes of a Philo&s;opher, that &s;carce any body under&s;tands. As for the Long Continuance of the&s;e Prodigious Sights in the Aire, it may be an&s;wered in a word, that it was Naturall: &s;eeing that the Hi&s;tories doe intimate, they were not &s;eene continually, and without Intermi&s;&s;ion: and by Con&s;equence, it might &s;o fall out, that at &s;ome time or other the next day, the Winds
<PB N="345" REF="192">might po&s;&s;ibly di&s;po&s;e the Clouds after the &s;ame manner, as on the day before.</P>
<P>The Third Rea&s;on, which is, that the Fi|gures of Angels have been often &s;een in the Clouds, is not of &s;ufficient Force to prove, that the&s;e Effects are Supernaturall. For, of|tentimes the Clouds, if they be Thicke, and Smooth, doe receive the Raies, and <HI>Species</HI> of things here below; which is the Cau&s;e that we &s;ee them by Reflection, as in a Loo|king-gla&s;&s;e. By rea&s;on whereof, <HI>Cardan</HI> re|ports, that one day there was the Appearance of an Angel, &s;een in the Clouds, at <HI>Millane;</HI> which cau&s;ed great A&s;toni&s;hment in the Peo|ple, till &s;uch time as <HI>Pelicanus,</HI> a Philo&s;o|pher, made it plainly appeare to them, that this Angel was nothing el&s;e but the Reflecti|on of an Image of Stone, that was on the top of the Church of S. <HI>Godart,</HI> which was repre|&s;ented in the Thicke Clouds, as in a Loo|king-gla&s;&s;e. And thus might <HI>Pomponatius</HI> have given a rea&s;on of the Apparitions in the Aire afore-mentioned, namely of <HI>S. Cele|&s;tine,</HI> at the City of <HI>Aquileia,</HI> and of <HI>S. Pe|tronia,</HI> at <HI>Bologne;</HI> without engaging him|&s;elfe in &s;o long, and tedious a Di&s;puta|tion.</P>
<P N="5">5. From this Emi&s;&s;ion of the Raies, and <HI>Species,</HI> &s;ome have conceived, that all tho&s;e Figures that are &s;een in the Aire, are nothing
<PB N="346" REF="193">el&s;e, but the Images of things here below. And therefore they &s;ay, that tho&s;e Armies, which have been often &s;een in the Aire, were the Raies of &s;ome Armies, that were in &s;ome part of the Earth, or other. And &s;o, that Navy of Ships, that was &s;eene floating in the Clouds by the <HI>Romans,</HI> when they were pre|paring to goe again&s;t the <HI>Genois;</HI> and again&s;t <HI>Per&s;es,</HI> the la&s;t King of the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> who was vanqui&s;hed by <HI>Aemilius,</HI> was likewi&s;e nothing el&s;e, but the Image of their owne Navy, which appeared upon the &s;mooth &s;urface of a Cloud. And according to this Doctrine, peradventure, the Armies of For|reign Kings may be knowne; and Newes may be conveyed, at a va&s;t di&s;tance; there being nothing to hinder it. For, as for tho&s;e Objections which are made again&s;t the <HI>Rea|ding,</HI> that <HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI> &s;peaks of, which he &s;aid might be done, by the help of the Moon, which &s;hould receive the <HI>Species</HI> of the Characters, as a Looking-gla&s;&s;e doth; they can have no place here; for as much as the Clouds are not very farre removed from us; and the Raies of Characters, or any other things, pre&s;ented before them, cannot be &s;pent, before they can reach &s;o farre, as they mu&s;t needs do with the Moon, by rea&s;on of its too great Di&s;tance. And thus perhaps is that Secret of <HI>Trithemius</HI> di&s;couered; where
<PB N="347" REF="193">he undertakes to &s;end Newes abroad, and make it knowne a great di&s;tance off in an In|&s;tant, by the help of certaine Spirits, who&s;e names he there &s;ets downe; which are, in my Opinion, nothing el&s;e but the Winds; &s;ome whereof are more proper for the di&s;po&s;ing of of the Clouds, then others are. We may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cour&s;e &s;ome other time, more ful|ly, of the&s;e Secrets of his; which have beene hitherto accounted, either utterly Fal&s;e, or el&s;e Diabolicall.</P>
<P N="6">6. It remaines now, that we &s;atisfie this Doubt here propo&s;ed: Namely, whether the&s;e Figures that are &s;een in the Aire, and in the Clouds, be the Images, and Repre&s;enta|tions of things here below, and con&s;equently purely Naturall, and are of no &s;ignification: Or, whether they are produced, and formed, by the Providence of God, who cea&s;eth not continually to forewarn us, by &s;ome Vi&s;ible Signe, or other, of what Evils &s;oever are to befall us; as we have formerly &s;aid.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> To which I &s;hall give this An&s;wer, which I con|ceive to be mo&s;t True: Namely, that, with|out all doubt, Many of the&s;e Figures are Na|turall; and are produced, either Accidental|ly, in the Clouds, or el&s;e by the Emi&s;&s;ion of the Image, and <HI>Species</HI> of things here be|low, as we have already &s;aid: But that there are al&s;o &s;ome, which we mu&s;t referre to the
<PB N="348" REF="194">wonderfull workes of God. Of this Later kind are Tho&s;e, &s;poken of by the Author of the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Maccabees;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2</HI> Mach. cap. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE> where <HI>Judas,</HI> fighting in Heavens Quarrell, had an Appa|rition &s;ent him, of five Hor&s;emen, appearing in the Aire; which pur&s;ued his Enemies with &s;o great violence, as that above twenty thou&s;and of them fell upon the place. <HI>Sed cum vehemens pugna e&s;&s;et, apparuerunt adver|&s;arijs de caelo viri quinque in Equis, fraenis aureis decori, ducatum Judae is prae&s;tantes: ex quibus duo Machabaeum medium habentes, ar|mis &s;uis circum&s;eptum incolumem con&s;erva|bant: in adver&s;arios autem tela et fulmina ja|ciebant; ex quo et caecitate confu&s;i, et repleti perturbatione, cadebant.</HI></P>
<P>If it be here objected, that the&s;e five Hor&s;|men might po&s;&s;ibly have been the Image, and <HI>Species</HI> of &s;ome of the Armie; I an&s;wer, that it appeares by the Circum&s;tances, that this could not be &s;o; it being mo&s;t evidently true, that the&s;e Hor&s;emen did not only &s;eeme to fight; but did Really fight, and charge the Enemie. And if the Lightning here menti|oned, had been Naturall, and had beene di&s;|charged from the Clouds; Both Armies &s;hould then have felt it alike. But &s;eeing, in that confu&s;ion, and mixture of both Armies together, the Darts fell from Heaven upon One of them only, and not upon the other;
<PB N="349" REF="194">we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conclude, that this was the Hand of God: Be&s;ides, that this Prodigy happened al&s;o, in a cleare, bright day, when the Aire was darkned with no Cloud. So that, as I am of Opinion, with <HI>Cardan,</HI> and <HI>Pomponatius,</HI> that oftentimes we may &s;ee in a Cloud, as in a Looking-gla&s;&s;e, the <HI>Species</HI> of the Statue of an Angel, or of a Saint, placed either on the top of a Church, or el&s;ewhere; or el&s;e, that our Sight may be deceived, and betrayed by our Imagination: &s;o do I like|wi&s;e believe, that the&s;e Vi&s;ions may &s;ome|times al&s;o be Divine; as was that Image of a Cro&s;&s;e, &s;hining mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly in the Aire, which was &s;eene by <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great; who afterwards found the Event to follow, according to the words, that he &s;aw written on it: <HI>In hoc &s;igno vinces.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. <HI>316.</HI> Hi&s;t.

<P><HI>Cardan</HI> cannot believe, that there is any Extraordinary Matter in This Raine: for as much as, the Red Drops (&s;aith He) lighting upon Mens Cloaths, might appeare in the forme of a Cro&s;&s;e, by rea&s;on of the Waters &s;preading it &s;elfe all along the threads, which are wrought Cro&s;&s;e-wi&s;e. But here he takes no notice, that the Hi&s;torians, that report this Story, affirm; that the&s;e drops of Blood fell in the forme of Cro&s;&s;es, not on Cloaths only, but upon the Stones al&s;o, and upon
<PB N="351" REF="195">their Meale: which is an Evident Demon|&s;tration, that the Cau&s;e of it was not Na|turall, but proceeded from &s;ome Divine Power. And certainly, the &s;ame kind of Rain, figured like Cro&s;&s;es, which happened in the time of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, what could it betoken, but the Sufferings of the Church, and the Ignominy of the Cro&s;&s;e?

For, there hath Haile been often &s;een, which hath borne the Figure, either of a Cro&s;&s;e, a Buck|ler, a Heart, or of a Death's-head: and if we doe not carele&s;ly pa&s;&s;e by the&s;e Wonders, when we meet with them; we may, no doubt, afterwards find the truth of the Events, fore|told by the&s;e <HI>Hieroglyphicall</HI> Figures.

But, as he was got a good way into the Wood, which led to his Dwelling; thinking with him&s;elf, that he &s;hould not be able to reach his own Hou&s;e, before the Rain fell, which commonly followes &s;uch kind of Tempe&s;ts, he took up his harbour under a Rock: un|der which he had not &s;taied about the &s;pace of a Quarter of an houre, but that, thinking the Malice of the Storm had been &s;pent, by a light Showre of Raine that had fallen; he began to go on with his Journey. But he was not gone a Stones ca&s;t, but he &s;aw &s;ome Haile begin to fall; which made him think of going back again. Notwith&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="356" REF="198">upon better Con&s;ideration, he began to think, that this Haile could not be very trou|ble&s;ome to him, &s;eeing it fell in &s;o &s;mall a Quantity; and pre&s;uming withall, that the Thickne&s;&s;e of the Trees would be well e|nough able to &s;ecure him from the violence of it. This Con&s;ideration had certainly put him upon his Journey again; had he not by Chance, ca&s;ting his eye upon &s;ome of the Haile&s;tones, as they fell, ob&s;erved, that they appeared to be of another kind of &s;hape, then commonly they u&s;ed to be. This made him &s;tay, to take better notice of them; &s;o that taking one of the Haile&s;tones up in his hand, he in&s;tantly perceived a Fearfull Pro|digy in it. For, &s;ome of them bare the fi|gure of a Head-piece; others, of a Scutche|on; and others, of a Sword. This Prodi|gious Novelty amazed him, and the Ap|prehen&s;ion of &s;ome Di&s;a&s;ter at hand, made him return back to the Rock again: where he was no &s;ooner arrived, but that there fell &s;o great, and &s;o violent a Storm of Haile, as that it killed not only Birds, but very many Bea&s;ts al&s;o. The like to this, I my &s;elf have al&s;o &s;ometime ob&s;erved, in <HI>Provence.</HI> This man then, returning home, after the Storme was pa&s;t, could find no more &s;uch figures upon the Hail&s;tones, as he had &s;een at fir&s;t: which made him conclude, that this Prodigy would

<PB N="366" REF="203">like another Sun; it may &s;ignifie the Birth of &s;ome Great Prince: as <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> the Hi&s;to|rian writes, that the yeare that <HI>Mithridates</HI> was borne, during the &s;pace of &s;eventy daies, there appeared a Comet; (&s;ome &s;ay, that it was a Star,) but &s;o Wonderfull a one, as that the Greatne&s;&s;e of it tooke up the fourth part of the Heavens; and the Light of It, e|clip&s;ed That of the Sun. <HI>Nam</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>et quo genitus e&s;t anno, et ex eo quo regnare primum caepit, &s;tella</HI> Cometes, <HI>per utrumque tempus, &s;eptuaginta diebus ita luxit, ut coe|lum omne conflagrari videretur: nam et mag|nitudine &s;ui, quartam caeli partem occupave|rat, et fulgore &s;ui, nitorem &s;olis vicerat: et quum oriretur, occumberet&abque;, quatuor &s;pa|tium horarum con&s;umebat.</HI> We have already &s;et downe, what Pre&s;ages may be made, from the Colour of the&s;e Comets.</P>
<P>The Third is, that if they be of a Pyra|midall Figure, we &s;hall then &s;uffer great Lo&s;|&s;es by Fire; and, by way of Analogy, may conclude, of &s;ome Tyranny approaching. And this is the Opinion of <HI>Cornelius Gemma,</HI> who expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elfe in the&s;e words.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Nat. Divin. Charact. l. <HI>1.</HI> c. <HI>6.</HI></NOTE> <HI>For|ta&s;&s;is, quae in acutam Pyramidem de&s;inunt, Ig|nis praedominia magis, et ex Analogia, in Re|publica Tyrannidem prae&s;ignificant.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth is, that if they be of much Extent, Waved, and Di&s;&s;ipated here and
<PB N="367" REF="203">there, in the forme of Waters; they then denote Seditions in the People: &s;eeing that a|mong all the Hieroglyphical Characters, that &s;ignifie the People, This of <HI>Water</HI> is the Chiefe&s;t; according to that Vi&s;ion of the Prophet: <HI>Aquae multae, populi multi.</HI> And it hath been very often ob&s;erved, that after a|ny Inundations, either of the Sea, or of Ri|vers; the People have pre&s;ently al&s;o made In&s;urrections.</P>
<P>The Fifth is, that if they be of the figure of a <HI>Horne,</HI> which is the <HI>Hieroglyphicke of Pow|er;</HI> as may be ob&s;erved out of the Scriptures, in very many places: they fore&s;hew the Great &s;trength of &s;ome Monarch, and an Ab&s;olute Power. Hi&s;torians report, that when <HI>Xer|xes</HI> invaded <HI>Greece,</HI> with a Million of Men; there appeared one of this kind of Comets, &s;hining mo&s;t re&s;plendently.</P>
<P>The Sixt is, that if they beare the figure of a <HI>Sword,</HI> they pre&s;age De&s;olations, which &s;hall be cau&s;ed by the Sword. Such a one was that, that appeared over the City of <HI>Hie|ru&s;alem,</HI> for the &s;pace of a whole yeare toge|ther, and did fore-&s;hew the death of Eleven Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Jewes,</HI> as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> te|&s;tifieth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">De bel. Iud.</NOTE> the greate&s;t part of which number fell by the &s;word. And in the yeare 1527. a Comet of the like Figure appeared, for many daies together; with this &s;trange Spectacle
<PB N="368" REF="204">attending it, that it was encompa&s;&s;ed round about with Launces, Pikes, and Halberts, with &s;uch a great number of Heads cut off, as that the Di&s;cription of it was full of Horrour. Tho&s;e that are the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in Hi&s;tory, cannot but know, how Calamitous a Time this was. If the Comet be figured like a Trumpet; it then al&s;o foretells of Wars: but if it be of the forme either of a Dart, or Ar|row; or el&s;e of a Javelin, it denounceth both Warre, and Pe&s;tilence; the Effects whereof flye abroad, as &s;wift as an Arrow. Such a one, as this, appeared <HI>An.</HI> 80.</P>
<P>Now, although that in all Comets, the&s;e &s;everall Figures may be produced Naturally; (if &s;o be, that the Matter (which we &s;uppo&s;e to be Elementary) be aptly di&s;po&s;ed,) whe|ther they be Long, Large, Pointed, Square, Ovall, Triangular, or Round; from whence proceed, Beames of Fire, Bucklers, <HI>Caprae Saltantes,</HI> which are &s;o called, not, for having the figure of a <HI>Goate;</HI> but, either becau&s;e this Comet hath &s;omething of the Re&s;emblance of a <HI>Goat's Beard,</HI> as <HI>Philoponus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Olym|piodorus</HI> affirme; or el&s;e, becau&s;e at the matter of it being di&s;per&s;ed, takes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> de|grees, one part after another, &s;eeming herein to imitate the skipping of <HI>Goates;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, for the Rea&s;on that is given by <HI>Seneca</HI> which I profe&s;&s;e I under&s;tand not,) where, &s;peaking

Thus, when the Wind blows behind them, one, or two of them, by turnes, place them&s;elves behind the re&s;t; &s;o that they are, as it were, a kind of &s;helter to the maine body of the Flight, which is divided into two Bran|ches. But if the wind chance to blow again&s;t them, they then pre&s;ently change their whole Order: For, whereas before, the Fore-part of their Body was divided into two Rankes, they now divide the Hinder part into two Rankes, repre&s;enting the Figure of a V, one of them only, flying in the head of the Com|pany, and dividing the Aire before them; and all the re&s;t, flying &s;moothy after it, as if they were joyned together in a Line, make way for the Wind in &s;uch &s;ort, as that mee|ting with no Re&s;i&s;tance, they flye with all po&s;&s;ible ea&s;e, and plea&s;ure. Sometimes they make a perfect Triangle; or a Semi-circle, like to a C; or el&s;e, a perfect Round O; as, when they are &s;et upon by an Eagle; by this means defending them&s;elves from his a&s;&s;aults. For, on which &s;ide &s;oever the Eagle comes, he en|counters with nothing but Bills: ju&s;t as a Bo|dy

The Fighting, and Gathering toge|ther of all other &s;orts of Birds, e&s;pecially
<PB N="374" REF="207">Birds of Prey, and which feed upon Fle&s;h, doth likewi&s;e often fore&s;hew &s;ome &s;ad Ac|cident approaching. Thus <HI>Dion</HI> reports, that when the Armies of the <HI>Triumvirate</HI> marched forth again&s;t the Complices of <HI>Pompey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>50.</HI></NOTE> to take a ju&s;t Revenge of <HI>Coe&s;ar's</HI> bloud, there were &s;een, hovering over the Troops of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;sius</HI> only, great numbers of Ravens, and Vultures; which by their Many, and Fearfull Cries, did fore|&s;hew the Ruine of The&s;e Two Murtherers. Neither need we travell &s;o far, for Exam|ples of this Nature: for, we have a like Sto|ry to this, delivered by <HI>Aeneas Sylvius;</HI> who, comming to be Pope, was afterwards called by the name of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Europ.</NOTE> <HI>Pius II.</HI> and it is this. In that Part of <HI>Gallia,</HI> (&s;aith he,) which is furnamed <HI>Belgica,</HI> not far from the City of <HI>Leige,</HI> a Falcon, as &s;he was &s;itting upon her Eggs in her Ne&s;t, a company of Ravens, perceiving her, &s;et upon her; and not con|tent with beating her, devoured her Egges al&s;o; and that, with &s;uch Strange, and Unu|&s;uall Out-cries, as that the Boors, and Shep|herds thereabout, who had ob&s;erved this Strange Piece of Tyranny, acted upon the Faulcon, were very much amazed at it. But at length, the Faulcon, though with much adoe, being gotten from them, the Shepherds thought the Quarrell to be now certainly o|ver,
<PB N="375" REF="207">and that they &s;hould heare no more of the&s;e Out-cries. But, which much increa&s;ed their Wonder, on the Morrow, they &s;aw ga|thered together, in the very &s;ame place, &s;o infinite a number of Faulcons, and Ravens, as that they could not have believed before, that there were &s;o many in the whole world: all which were now gathered together to de|cide this Difference, betwixt the Faulcon and the Ravens; the Place, and Combat being, as it were, agreed on, on both &s;ides. The Faulcons pitched their Battell toward the South &s;ide of the Place; and the Ravens to|ward the North: and both the One, and the Other, ob&s;erved their Ranks, and Order as exactly, and beheld each other with as fierce Countenances, as if they had been Armies of Men. At length, after they had been ob&s;erved to keep this Order, for &s;ome little time, (&s;ome of them being, as it were, in the Main Body of the Army; and others, in the Wings,) the Fight began, with &s;uch Fury; as that, in an In&s;tant, the place all about was covered with Feathers, and Bloud, and with dead bodies of both Parties. But in Conclu&s;ion, the Faulcons wonne the Day: and it &s;eemed but Rea&s;onable; that They, who fought in &s;o ju&s;t a Cau&s;e, &s;hould bear away the Victory.

<P>We &s;ay then, that Birds may Naturally fore&s;hew &s;ad Accidents approaching; if we except all &s;uch, as depend upon the Will of Man; as, to give Battell, or, Not to give Battell: for, in this ca&s;e, all Pre&s;ages are Vain. And if by Chance the fore|mentioned Battels were ob&s;erved to be fought, after tho&s;e of the Birds; yet the Birds can|not be thought to have fore-&s;hewed them: &s;ince it is by meer Accident, that the Birds fought in the Aire, either before, or at the &s;ame time, that men fought upon the Earth: or el&s;e, perhaps, God may &s;ometimes make u&s;e of the&s;e Extraordinary Signes, to pre|pare us, (as we have &s;aid before,) again&s;t the Evils that we are to encounter with.</P>
<P>To keep our &s;elves therefore within the Compa&s;&s;e of Naturall Cau&s;es; we affirm, that we may fore&s;ee Fair weather, Raine, Thunder, Pe&s;tilence, the Overwhelming of Cities, and Hills, and al&s;o the Naturall Death of Men, by the Naturall Di&s;po&s;ition of Birds; and that, three manner of Waies.

And here I cannot but wonder, that among all tho&s;e Hi&s;torians, that have written of the Pre&s;ages of Birds; there is &s;carcely any of them that have endeavour|ed to give the Natural Cau&s;es of them. They will tell you perhaps, that again&s;t Raine, &s;ome certain Birds will fly clo&s;e to the &s;ide of Rivers; but they do not tell, what &s;hould be the Cau&s;e of their Flying thither, rather then to any other place. But, &s;eeing that all the&s;e Actions are not done, without &s;ome Rea&s;on, or other; we &s;hall here indeavour, in a few words, to di&s;cover what it may be.</P>
<P>It is certain then, that Birds which keep alwaies in the Air, have a more perfect Sen&s;e, and Apprehen&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Temper of It, then We can have: and this is the rea&s;on, why again&s;t all Changes of the Air, and of the Weather, they are wont to give us &s;ome Signe of it: as, for example, to Sing, and Chirp very plea&s;antly, when the Aire is Clear, and Calm; and on the other &s;ide, to change their Note, when it begins to be troubled and overca&s;t; and to fly to Ri|vers &s;ides, when it is like to Rain; e&s;peci|lly tho&s;e that delight in eating of Worms;
<PB N="379" REF="209">which abounding mo&s;t about River's banks, by rea&s;on of the Corruption, and Humidi|ty, alwaies come abroad out of the Earth, again&s;t Wet weather. And this is the Rea|&s;on, why Crowes fly to Rivers &s;ides, when it is like to Rain. Secondly, if the Aire begin to be infected with any Contagion; they, finding them&s;elves annoyed thereby, pre&s;ently get them gone, and quit the Coun|try; although it be &s;o Fat, and plentifull a one, as that it affords them more &s;tore of Food, then any other place can. Thirdly, they u&s;e to fly away, and for&s;ake a City, or Hill, which is neer falling to Ruine, and to be Overwhelmed; by rea&s;on that the Hill, or City, not falling to the ground &s;udden|ly, as it &s;eems to Us to do; but, by little and little; there are cau&s;ed by this meanes certain Rifts, and Openings in the Earth, out of which a&s;cends &s;o Contagious an Aire, as that the Birds, (which are far quick|er Sented then We are,) perceiving it, pre|&s;ently leave the place, and fly away. Thus did tho&s;e Birds, which we have formerly mentioned, out of <HI>Rab. Elcha,</HI> fly all of them away, even as much as the very Poultry, when the City, wherein they were, was now ready to be overwhelmed by the Ruine of Two Mountains. We have al&s;o &s;aid be|fore, that in a certain Village, in <HI>Suitzerland,</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="210">called <HI>PLOURS,</HI> the very Bees did the like. The In&s;tance of a Man neer death, doth al&s;o confirm this Truth: for, when he is at his la&s;t Ga&s;p, the Pores being o|pened, by a Certain Violent Labouring of Nature, &s;end forth &s;o Corrupt an Aire, or Sweat; that the very Fleas, not enduring it, leave the place. The &s;ame is al&s;o report|ed of Rats, and Mice; who will be &s;ure to for&s;ake a hou&s;e, that is ready to fall. And certainly no man can doubt, but that the Air which is pent up in the Clo&s;e holes, either of a Mountain, or of the Foundation of a City, or of the Walls of a Hou&s;e, mu&s;t needs be very Corrupt, and Putrified Air; which, when it commeth to be exhaled, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be very dangerous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Vari|et. l. <HI>3.</HI> c. <HI>3</HI></NOTE> to all tho&s;e that &s;hall take it in. And in this &s;en&s;e we are to under&s;tand <HI>Cardan,</HI> when he &s;aies; that a City is neer its Ruine, when the Ra|vens are ob&s;erved to croak, more then u&s;u|ally: fora&s;much as, the&s;e Birds having a Sent of the Putrid Air, that i&s;&s;ueth out of the Earth, think it to be Carrion; after which they are &s;o greedy, &s;aith <HI>Aelian,</HI> as that get|ting to the tops of Trees, or el&s;e flying a|bout in the Air, they turn them&s;elves about toward every bla&s;t of Wind, that &s;o having a Sent of any, they may goe, and fea&s;t them&s;elves upon it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THo&s;e, who have diligently ex|amined the Choyce&s;t parts of the Learning of the An|cients, have ob&s;erved, that there is nothing that is more Ab&s;urd, in Appearance, then the Figures of the Cele&s;tiall Con&s;tellations. For, what a Confu&s;ed thing is it, (&s;ay They) that, in tho&s;e places, which are de&s;tined to be the place of abode for the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirits only, there &s;hould be lodged &s;uch numbers of Bea&s;ts; and, &s;ome of them &s;o dreadfull, as that we cannot thinke of them, but with Hor|rour? If they had placed only Men there, and had allotted a <HI>Ca&s;tor,</HI> and a <HI>Pollux,</HI> Do|minion there; this might have been interpre|ted an Error of Love; which &s;uffers us not to be content, in wi&s;hing &s;mall Honours to tho&s;e we Love. This Con&s;ideration might al&s;o have &s;atisfied tho&s;e, who complained, that the Cele&s;tiall Figures were nothing el&s;e, but the Repre&s;entations of the &s;everall Scapes of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> &amp; that the whole Face of the Hea|vens was filled, with the Notes of his Ince|&s;tuous Prankes: &s;o that if any one &s;hould un|dertake
<PB N="385" REF="212">to excu&s;e the&s;e Amorous Signes, he would be the le&s;&s;e blame-worthy; in that hee did it, only in Defence of the mo&s;t &s;weet, and Powerfull of all our Pa&s;&s;ions. The Excu&s;e of tho&s;e, who impo&s;ed upon the&s;e Incorrup|tible Bodies, the Figures of Brute Bea&s;ts that are mo&s;t &s;ubject to Corruption, and even of Things Inanimate al&s;o, was mo&s;t ju&s;t; &s;eeing that, in &s;o doing, they had no other De&s;igne, but what was Religious. Thus we &s;ee Fi&s;hes there, Cen&s;ers, and Eares of Corn in a Vir|gins hand: And, tho&s;e who are skilled in the Secrets of the Ancient Theology, know well enough, that it was not without &s;ome My&s;ti|call rea&s;on, that they placed one Crowne in the South part of Heaven, con&s;i&s;ting of Thirteen Bright Stars; and another in the Northern part, containing eight &s;tars in it. But to place Dragons there, and Serpents, and Hydra's; Rea&s;on can never endure. And yet, &s;ee the Strangene&s;&s;e of the thing! For Though the Ancienes had thus filled the Hea|vens with Brute Bea&s;ts; and that, according to this their Doctrine, one would have ima|gined this Cele&s;tiall Paradi&s;e to have been, an Habitation of Mon&s;ters, and a Dreadfull Wilderne&s;s, rather then the Seat of the Ble&s;&s;ed, &amp; a Place abounding with all manner of Plea|&s;ures; yet notwith&s;tanding neither hath the Church ever reproved it, nor any of the An|cient
<PB N="386" REF="213">Fathers di&s;avowed it. Now the Subject we treat of, is much le&s;&s;e Scandalous; and, by Con&s;equence, more Tolerable. For, what danger can there be, in affirming; that the di|ver&s;e Figures of the Starres repre&s;ent, and make up the different Characters of the <HI>He|brew</HI> Alphabet? And, that as The&s;e Letters have &s;ome Signification, when they are Single, as well as when they are joyned with others: in like manner the Stars, either alone, or joyned with other Stars, doe note unto us &s;ome My&s;teries? Yea rather, this Doctrine of ours is &s;o farre from being &s;uch, as men &s;hould beware of, and hold it Su&s;pected; as that, on the Contrary, it teacheth the Mani|fold Wonders of God; and proveth, that all the&s;e Stars have not their Order be&s;towed on them in vaine; and that their Motions, and different A&s;pects are not utterly u&s;ele&s;&s;e, and without any De&s;igne. In&s;omuch that, in my Opinion, it would be no le&s;&s;e then Bla&s;|phemy in any man, to affirme the Contrary; or to &s;ay, that they are placed there, only for Ornament, and to beautifie the Heavens, and to give Light; and for no other cau&s;e at all. But, what Madne&s;&s;e is it to confine the&s;e Wonderful Lights to One only Opera|tion; &s;eeing that, be&s;ides that Experience tea|cheth us, that the <HI>Moone</HI> is the Governe&s;&s;e of all Humours; the <HI>Sun,</HI> the Principle of Life;

As for our Modern Writers, it would even amaze a man to con&s;ider, that among &s;uch infinite numbers of Books, wherewith our Libraries are &s;tuffed, there is hardly Five, or Six to be found, that have taken any No|tice at all, of this Curious Piece of Anti|quity, concerning this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Writing.</HI> I know very well, that Ignorance will be pre|&s;ently ready with this An&s;wer; that the Va|nitie of the Subject, is the rea&s;on of this Their Silence.

For which cau&s;e, inter|preting their Alphabet, they deduce, from the fir&s;t Letter, which is <HI>ALIPH,</HI> this Verb <HI>Conjungere:</HI> from the &s;econd Letter, which

And perhaps it is in Ob&s;ervation to this Do|ctrine, that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> doe never begin to write the fir&s;t part of a word, at the end of a Line, and the re&s;t of it at the beginning of the next Line; as the <HI>Greekes,</HI> and <HI>Latines</HI> u&s;e to doe: but if the &s;pace be not &s;ufficient to hold the whole word, they draw a &s;troake from the la&s;t Letter of the La&s;t word, to the end of the Line.

<PB N="405" REF="222">a great number of them, that they have beene taken from the <HI>Hebrew:</HI> and even Children may be able to judge of the Truth hereof, by comparing but the Arabicke <HI>Hha,</HI> with the Hebrew <HI>He;</HI> the <HI>Cha,</HI> with the <HI>Cheth;</HI> the <HI>Ra,</HI> with the <HI>Re&s;ch;</HI> the <HI>Zain,</HI> with the <HI>Zain;</HI> the <HI>Sin,</HI> with the <HI>Schin;</HI> the <HI>Tha,</HI> with the <HI>Teth;</HI> the <HI>Ain,</HI> with the <HI>Aghin;</HI> the <HI>Pha,</HI> with the <HI>Pe;</HI> the <HI>Caph,</HI> with the <HI>Caph;</HI> the <HI>Lam,</HI> with the <HI>Lamed;</HI> the <HI>Vau,</HI> with the <HI>Vau,</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="408" REF="224">de&s;ires. The &s;ame al&s;o may be &s;aid of <HI>Tau|rus:</HI> for there are Eleven Starres to be &s;eene there, which are E&s;&s;entially of this Con&s;tel|lation; and yet are not brought in, in the Pi|cture of it. So likewi&s;e in the Con&s;tellation of <HI>Gemini</HI> there are Eleven Stars belonging to it, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e Nine|teen, that repre&s;ent the Figure of this Signe: as <HI>Cancer</HI> al&s;o hath Foure bright Stars, which lie Loo&s;e from tho&s;e Nine, which make up the Image of this Living Creature. But as for the Hebrew Letters, there is nothing to hinder us, from finding them di&s;tinctly de&s;cri|bed: and if any one doe chance to find either <HI>Arabicke,</HI> or <HI>Samaritane</HI> Letters there; this is &s;till but to returne backe to the Originall, from whence they were taken.</P>
<P N="8">8. Fir&s;t then we are to take notice, that the Starres which make up the&s;e Letters, are not di&s;po&s;ed into the order they appeare in, at all adventures, nor in any confu&s;ed way, as they &s;eeme to us to be: but are placed thus, with &s;ome De&s;igne, and in a Divine Order; God having made all things in full Perfection. Tho&s;e that under&s;tand not the Play of <HI>Che&s;&s;e,</HI> &s;eeing the Pieces &s;tand here and there, &s;o con|fu&s;edly, will be apt to thinke, no doubt, that they &s;tand in that confu&s;ed manner by meere haphazard, &s;eeing that in &s;ome places there are a great many; and in &s;ome, very few;
<PB N="409" REF="224">and one &s;ide of the Che&s;&s;e-board is full, and the other &s;ide quite bare; and in a third place perhaps you &s;hall have but two, or three: In a word, this Difference in the placing of the Pieces is &s;o great, as that hee will certainely conclude, that the whole Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e is clearely without any De&s;igne at all: notwith&s;tanding that they are all ranked in very exact Order; and that there is not the lea&s;t Piece there, but is of u&s;e, and doth its proper Office.

<P>Secondly, that although the Stars which are in the Eighth Heaven, (if at lea&s;t there be any &s;uch thing as an Eighth Heaven,) be Fixed; yet do they not therefore alwayes compo&s;e the &s;ame Letters; at lea&s;t, the greate&s;t part of them; but they have their Changes, according to the Diver&s;e A&s;pects of the Planets.

In the Fourth place, that we may be able perfectly to under&s;tand this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Writing,</HI> we mu&s;t exactly ob&s;erve the Ver|ticall Stars: for, tho&s;e which are over a Kingdome, &s;aith <HI>Abiudan,</HI> doe ordinarily &s;hew; what ever is like to befall it.

If it be further de|manded; Why, in this kind of <HI>Writing,</HI> there are, in one and the &s;ame word, Great, and Small Letters, or Stars, mingled together? it may be an&s;wered, that the Rea&s;on is, to make us take more Notice of tho&s;e Letters in the Word, which are the Mo&s;t Significa|tive; which is a Cour&s;e, that the <HI>Anagram|mati&s;ts</HI> are very well acquainted withall.

<PB N="426" REF="233">the&s;e Three Letters, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Rob,</HI> which make up the Number of 208. which was the time of the Duration of this Monarchy, which was founded by <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>The End of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire was like|wi&s;e fore-&s;hewed, by Four Stars, which made up the Verb <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Parad;</HI> which &s;ig|nifieth, to <HI>Divide:</HI> and that in This Wonderfull Man|ner, as that the very &s;ame Letters did pro|duce al&s;o the Number of years that this Mo|narchy la&s;ted, which took beginning, at the time that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great &s;ubdued the la&s;t <HI>Darius.</HI></P>
<P>That of the <HI>Athenians</HI> la&s;ted but 490. years; which is the Number of the&s;e Three Letters, which Foure Stars, that were Ver|ticall to this Place, did compo&s;e; <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>T&s;arar,</HI> which &s;ignifieth, <HI>Angu&s;tijs affici.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e Foure Stars, &s;aith <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">mer,</HI> there were Foure other ob&s;er|ved al&s;o, which made up two <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Caphs;</HI> I know not Why though, &s;aith He; unle&s;&s;e it be, that the&s;e Letters are Fatall, and of Sad <HI>Omen.</HI> I &s;hall adde my Conjecture here, that po&s;&s;ibly they might point out the&s;e Two Names, <HI>Cecrops,</HI> and <HI>Codrus;</HI> which are the
<PB N="427" REF="233">names of tho&s;e Two Kings, under whom this Powerfull Monarchy had its Ri&s;e, and Fall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romane Con&s;ulate</HI> could not maintain Its Power beyond the Term of 500. years: becau&s;e that the&s;e Bounds were determinate|ly prefixed to it, in this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Booke,</HI> by Eight Verticall Stars, which compo&s;ed this Word, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Raa&s;ch,</HI> which bare this Sen&s;e, &amp; Num|ber: <HI>Cacumen,</HI> 501.</P>
<P>The <HI>Monarchy</HI> of <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar,</HI> which was built upon the Ruine of the <HI>Con&s;ulate;</HI> as This al&s;o was, upon the Ejection of the Kings, was very neer of the &s;ame Continu|ance; and the End of it was in like manner prefixed by Six Sars, which made up the&s;e Three Letters, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Scavar,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>To Break;</HI> the Number whereof is 502.</P>
<P>But, that we may produce &s;omething, con|cerning Things Yet to Come, <HI>R. Chomer</HI> a&s;|&s;ures us, that it is now a good while &s;ince, that this Cele&s;tiall Writing hath pointed out the Declining of Two great Empires of the Ea&s;t. The Fir&s;t is, that of the <HI>Turkes;</HI> over which there are ob&s;erved &s;even Verticall Stars, which being read from the We&s;t to the Ea&s;t, (for, it would be a great Ble&s;&s;ing, to &s;ee the
<PB N="428" REF="234">Ruine of this Empire,) make up this word, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Caah;</HI> which &s;ignifieth, to be <HI>Battered, Feeble, Langui&s;hing,</HI> and <HI>Drawing to an End.</HI> But now,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aleph,</HI> which in humbers, &s;ignifieth, 1. &s;tand|eth al&s;o for 1000. as the re&s;t of the letters al&s;o doe; as may be ob&s;erved out of Hebrew Gram|mars.</NOTE> &s;eeing it may be doubted at what time this Empire &s;hall be reduced to this Extremity; the &s;ame Letters doe clearly re&s;olve this Doubt. For, the Middle Letter, which is <HI>Aleph,</HI> being made up of Brighter, and more Sparkling Stars, then the Others are, &s;hew|eth, &s;aith <HI>Chomer,</HI> that Its Number is the Greater; &s;o that, in This place it &s;tandeth for 1000. and the Fir&s;t letter &s;ignifieth, 20. and the La&s;t, 5. So that, when this King|dome &s;hall have accompli&s;hed the number of 1025. years, it &s;hall then be overthrowne, and brought to Ruine. Now, if we reckon from the year of our Lord 630. which was the year, (according to our Vulgar Compu|tion,) wherein the Foundation of this Em|pire was laid; we &s;hall find, that it is to la&s;t till the year of our Lord 1655. for the compleating of the afore&s;aid number 1025. &s;o that, reckoning from this pre&s;ent yeare, 1650. this Kingdome is to la&s;t but Five years longer.</P>
<P>The Other Ea&s;tern Kingdome, who&s;e De|clining is pointed out by the Stars, accord|ing to <HI>K. Chomer,</HI> is that of <HI>China:</HI> but this <HI>Rabbin</HI> delivers him&s;elf in &s;uch an Ob&s;cure
<PB N="429" REF="234">manner, in di&s;cour&s;ing of this la&s;t piece of <HI>Ce|le&s;tiall Writing;</HI> as that, till I under&s;tand it better, I &s;hall forbeare to &s;et it downe. Hee produceth al&s;o diver&s;e Others, which doe de|fine the Particular Durations of mo&s;t of the Kingdomes of <HI>Europe:</HI> all which I may happi|ly communicate to the World hereafter, when I have fir&s;t &s;eene, how the&s;e <HI>Curio&s;ities</HI> are received.</P>
<P N="12">12. Now, that I may freely deliver my owne Judgment concerning this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Wri|ting,</HI> I mu&s;t take Liberty to propo&s;e &s;ome few Objections, which, I have found, may be brought again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t is, that if &s;o be, by this <HI>Writing,</HI> all the Great Mutations in the World may be known; it is po&s;&s;ible then, that the End of the World may in like manner be found out by It; as being the Greate&s;t, and mo&s;t Impor|tant of all the re&s;t: &s;o that Men may, by a na|turall Meanes, attain to the knowledge of This Great Secret: which is Contrary to the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>The Second is, that A&s;trologers have been able to foretel many of the&s;e Mutations, which have afterwards come to pa&s;&s;e accordingly; and yet have never had any knowledge of This &s;trange Kind of <HI>Writing:</HI> It is therefore U&s;e|le&s;&s;e, and Imaginary.</P>
<P>The Third is, that the Po&s;ition of the Stars
<PB N="430" REF="235">is not &s;o E&s;&s;entiall to the Letter, which it is brought to make up; but that the &s;ame Star may as well make, for Example, a <HI>Re&s;ch,</HI> as a <HI>Daleth;</HI> and &s;o of all the re&s;t: and Con&s;e|quently, Severall Men, forming &s;everal Cha|racters of the &s;ame Starres, may draw from them Contrary &s;en&s;es, the one to the other.</P>
<P>But to all the&s;e Objections, I an&s;wer brief|ly thus. To the Fir&s;t, I &s;ay, that it is not Ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Writing</HI> &s;hould fore|&s;hew the end of the World; becau&s;e that God may have re&s;erved this Secret to Him&s;elfe: Or el&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math.</HI> 24.29. <HI>Mar.</HI> 13.24. <HI>Luc.</HI> 21.25.</NOTE> that It will Really foretel This hereafter; when tho&s;e Other Signes, &s;et downe by the E|vangeli&s;ts, &s;hall &s;hew it al&s;o: it being all one to &s;ay, that the Starres &s;hall fore-&s;hew it by &s;ome certaine <HI>Writing;</HI> as to &s;ay, that the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Moone</HI> &s;hall foretell it, by their being Dark|ned.</P>
<P>To the Second, I an&s;wer; that the Foure Grand Cau&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Card. <HI>1.</HI> Aph.</NOTE> which (according to the Opi|nion of A&s;trologers) produce the greate&s;t Mu|tations; the Fir&s;t whereof is, the Changing of the <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> and <HI>Perigaeum</HI> of the Planets: the Second, the Changing of the Excentrici|ty of the <HI>Sun,</HI> of <HI>Venus,</HI> of <HI>Mercury,</HI> of <HI>Saturne,</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and of <HI>Mars:</HI> the Third, the diver&s;e Figure of the Obliquity of the Zodiacke; and the Fourth, the Conjunction, (cheifly the Great one) of the Superiour Planets: I &s;ay,
<PB N="431" REF="235">that all the&s;e Foure Cau&s;es may, for the mo&s;t part, be comprized within this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Wri|ting:</HI> that is to &s;ay, that it hath happened very often, that at what time this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Writing</HI> did point out &s;ome great Change, there was at the &s;ame time al&s;o a Conjunction of the Supe|riour Planets; or el&s;e, &s;ome one of the Three other forenamed Cau&s;es. So that They, not under&s;tanding any thing of this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Wri|ting,</HI> imputed tho&s;e changes which they ob&s;er|ved to come to pa&s;&s;e, to tho&s;e Foure Rea&s;ons only. But that it may clearly appeare unto us, that The&s;e have not been the True Cau&s;es of all the&s;e Changes; we need but have recour&s;e to the <HI>Chronologies,</HI> and Particular Annals of each &s;everall Kingdome, and compare them with the A&s;trologicall Ob&s;ervations; and wee &s;hall finde, that the greate&s;t part of all the Grand Mutations have happened, without any Conjunction of the Greater Planets, or any of the other Cau&s;es before &s;pecified. So that we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily flye to &s;ome other more Cer|tain Means, by which we may be able to fore|know, by the A&s;pects, and Motions of the Stars, all the&s;e Events. Now this Means can be no Other, as it &s;eemeth, but this <HI>Cele&s;tiall Writing.</HI></P>
<P>To the Third Objection, which &s;eemeth to have the mo&s;t Weight in it, it may be an&s;we|red, that it is true indeed, that a Man may make
<PB N="432" REF="236">a <HI>Re&s;ch</HI> of the &s;ame Star, that another man per|haps will make a <HI>Daleth</HI> of: but in This, as in many other things, wee are to follow the Tradition of the Ancients, and to re&s;t &s;atisfied with what They have delivered unto us. O|therwi&s;e, there will not be any Certainty at all, in any One of the re&s;t of the Sciences; e&s;peci|ally in A&s;trology: which requireth, that tho&s;e Stars which compo&s;e, for Example, the Con|&s;tellation of <HI>Aries,</HI> or the <HI>Ramme,</HI> &s;hould be de|&s;cribed rather in the Figure of this Bea&s;t, then in that of an <HI>Oxe,</HI> or a <HI>Hor&s;e;</HI> and &s;o in all the re&s;t. So that who ever &s;hould repre&s;ent the Figure of a <HI>Bull,</HI> among the Stars that belong to the <HI>Ramme;</HI> and the Figure of a <HI>Ramme,</HI> a|mong tho&s;e of the <HI>Bull;</HI> he would de&s;troy the very Principles of A&s;trology: notwith&s;tand|ing that the Stars of <HI>Taurus</HI> would as well bear the Figure of a <HI>Ramme,</HI> as of a <HI>Bull.</HI> In like manner, he that &s;hould make a <HI>Re&s;ch</HI> of &s;uch a Star, as he &s;hould have made a <HI>Daleth</HI> of; not|with&s;tanding that the Star would beare it, yet would he overthrow the Principles of this <HI>Ce|le&s;tiall Writing.</HI></P>
<P>If it be now demanded; who it is, that is to judge of the va&s;t number of New Letters that are made daily, by the Diver&s;e A&s;pects of the Planets? I an&s;wer; that it appertaineth to tho&s;e Men, who are Piou&s;ly, and Religiou&s;ly ver|&s;ed in this <HI>Heavenly Writing;</HI> and, not to all
<PB N="433" REF="236">kind of Per&s;ons indifferently. But I &s;hall as yet &s;u&s;pend my own Judgment, as wel in This, as in all the re&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Curio&s;ities,</HI> which I have here delivered; till &s;uch time as I &s;hall have found either Weaker, or Stronger Rea&s;ons.</P>
