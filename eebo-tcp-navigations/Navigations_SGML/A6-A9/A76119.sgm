<HEAD>THE TRUE RELATION OF C^a^p^t^: WILL: BATTEN: TOUCHING The tran&s;porting of the &s;ix MEMBERS.</HEAD>
<P>_WHereas the Reports are various concerning the going beyond Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s of &s;ix or the eleven Members: And that &s;ome hath under|taken to put it in Print con|contrary to Truth: I &s;hall therefore brief|ly and truly &s;et it downe, as followeth.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>Sir <HI>Philip Stapleton:</HI> Sir <HI>William Lewis:</HI> Sir <HI>William Waller:</HI> Sir <HI>John Clotworthy,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Long:</HI> hired a &s;mall Ketch to tran&s;|port them to <HI>Holland:</HI> which Ketch be|longed unto one <HI>Greene,</HI> being let to them for twenty pounds, halfe whereof was paid in hand, and the other halfe at their landing, and &s;ixtie pounds &s;ecuritie: gi|ven for to In&s;ure the Ketch: All this was done by the con&s;ent of the &s;aid <HI>Green:</HI> The place where they were to be receiv'd: was <HI>Should-Haven,</HI> a little below <HI>Tilbury-Hope:</HI> where foure of the&s;e Gentlemen came by Land, and Sir <HI>Iohn Clotworthy</HI> in a paire of Oares by <HI>Grave&s;end:</HI> who all met there, and imbarked them&s;elves; <HI>Green</HI> like a craftie fellow, having re|ceiv'd the moitie of his Money, puts in another Ma&s;ter to goe over with the Ve&s;|&s;el, and as &s;oone as the Gentlemen were imbarked, goes up to the <HI>Block-hou&s;e</HI> to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and there informes Captaine <HI>Redman,</HI> that they were gone away with his Ve&s;&s;ell, with a great deale of Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Whereupon, the &s;aid Captaine gives
<PB N="5" REF="3">him a Warrant to pur&s;ue, and make &s;tay of them, and to that purpo&s;e &s;ent a Trooper with him, who comming downe into <HI>Kent,</HI> before <HI>Marrget</HI> e&s;pied this Ketch and there told the <HI>Marrget men</HI> that they were runne away with his Ketch, and had fifteen <HI>Portmantuas</HI> of Trea&s;ure a|bord.</P>
<P>The men of <HI>Marrget</HI> very readily beat up their Drums, &amp; manned A <HI>Doggerboate,</HI> that was bound to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and one <HI>Roger Lamings</HI> had the command of her, who a little before had a Commi&s;&s;ion from &s;ome of the&s;e Gentlemen, to rai&s;e a Company again&s;t the Armie, and received ten pounds in Money, and had rai&s;ed &s;ome force.</P>
<P>This <HI>Lamings</HI> pur&s;ued after them tho|rough the <HI>Downes;</HI> but they were gone two or three leagues a head of: &s;o calling to the <HI>Nicodemas,</HI> a Frigat under my Com|mand: who pre&s;ently let &s;lip, and follow|ed him, and halfe Seas over brought her up: who very readily and willingly came backe with them to me: &s;o that &s;he was
<PB N="6" REF="4">not brought back by <HI>Laminges</HI> as is &s;ugge|&s;ted.</P>
<P>This &s;ixteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at night, the <HI>Nicodemas</HI> brought back the ve&s;&s;ell, with the Members, whom I tooke abord the Ship, and &s;ecured the Ve&s;&s;ell, and about eight a clock at night, &s;ent away <HI>Lamings</HI> to <HI>Marget,</HI> to &s;ee what <HI>Green,</HI> or any o|thers had any pretences again&s;t them: charging him to be back in the morning early.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth, in the Morning I called a Councell of Warre, the Re&s;ult whereof was, that in regard the&s;e Members had all &s;everall pa&s;&s;es, from the <HI>Speaker</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Commons:</HI> dated the tenth, and eleventh of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and an Order of both Hou&s;es to the <HI>Speaker</HI> for granting them: It was held fit to di&s;mi&s;&s;e them; After their Ve&s;&s;ell was &s;earched by Sir <HI>Georg Askew,</HI> Captaine <HI>Crandley,</HI> Captaine <HI>Moore,</HI> Captaine <HI>Pa&s;&s;ey:</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Ketch, and divers others, where was nothing found, but five <HI>Portmantuas:</HI> with a &s;uit for each of waring Apparell, and the like
<PB N="7" REF="4">nece&s;&s;aries, and not a pennie of money as was &s;ugge&s;ted; and about twelve a clock, no man appearing from <HI>Marget,</HI> they were di&s;mi&s;t, in regard of the extreame &s;ick|ne&s;&s;e of Sir <HI>Phillip Stapleton,</HI> that he might not lie another night on the water, but land at <HI>Callis</HI> before night, where hee is &s;ince dead: About two a clock that after|noone, <HI>Lamings</HI> returned with <HI>Greene,</HI> and the Trooper with Captaine <HI>Redmans</HI> War|rant; the Ve&s;&s;ell then being neare halfe Seas ove, And whereas it is reported, and prin|ted, that they were reviled, and ba&s;ely u&s;ed, tis utterly fal&s;e; the Trooper was &s;hewed their Pa&s;&s;es, who was therewith &s;atisfied, and dranke a cup of Wine: It is true, that I told <HI>Greene</HI> and <HI>Lamings</HI> of their knaverie.</P>
<P>And for Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> he came not to mee till the twentie one, and brought the <HI>Spea|kers</HI> Pa&s;&s;e of the eleventh: and an Order of the <HI>Committe</HI> of the Admiralty of the thirteenth, for a Ship to tran&s;port him, who went out of the <HI>Downes</HI> the two and twen|tieth in the morning, upon the <HI>Leopard:</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5">who was bound toward St. <HI>Mallo,</HI> on ano|ther de&s;igne.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a &s;hort and true Re|lation of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, which I will ju&s;tifie to the world: and have all their Pa&s;&s;es and papers to make it good.</P>
