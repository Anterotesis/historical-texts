<SALUTE>For <HI>ROBERT BARKLEY, &amp;c.</HI></SALUTE>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BEing credibly informed, that your &s;elf, with &s;ome other Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> have purcha&s;ed an Intere&s;t in <HI>Ea&s;t-New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> (my being a <HI>Scots-man,</HI> and Well|wi&s;her to that Nation) puts me upon giving you this &s;hort Narrative, or account of it in general, (having lived there many years, which gave me full knowledge and experience of the &s;ame) le&s;t you may be di&s;couraged from the pro&s;ecution of your Intention of Settlement, as many others of your Countrey-men in like nature have been; (after a &s;eeming Re&s;olution to effect their De&s;ignes) to our great di&s;honour and detriment, and to enthraldom, and perpetual Slavery of &s;ome thou&s;ands of our poor Labourers; who, if they could be made &s;en&s;ible of the difference between their pre&s;ent State or Condition, and the hight of good Living, which in a few years (by GODS Ble&s;&s;ing and their own Indu&s;trie) they may accompli&s;h with half the Labour, many of them u&s;e in their own Country, (the Soil being &s;o Rich and Fer|tile, and rendring Increa&s;e beyond Imagination, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ing ours) would u&s;e all means po&s;&s;ible, for their &s;peedy Tran&s;portation thither.</P>
<P><HI>The Country is in general as followeth,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Impr.</HI> As to the Climate, it is Moderate and Healthy, having Win|ter and Summer as <HI>Britain,</HI> the Summers there being a little &s;horter, and in the Winters their dayes longer.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> As to the Soyl, it is Rich and Fertile, endued with much good Timber, and great quantities of Fre&s;h and Salt Meadows; as al&s;o, much Meadow-ground, which is Arrable, and &s;o Rich and Deep of Black-mould, that it is never to be worn out; well accommodated with Salt and Fre&s;h Rivers, good Fi&s;hing, great plenty of Deers, and wild Fowl; Produces all &s;ort of <HI>Engli&s;h-grain,</HI> with great Increa&s;s, be&s;ides <HI>In|dian-corn,</HI> upon which is unexpre&s;&s;ible Increa&s;e.</P>
<PB REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 68 -->
<P><HI>Item.</HI> There is great &s;tocks of Cattle, Sheep, and Hogs, good Oxen, and plenty of Hor&s;es, all &s;ort of Dunghil-fowl, and all to be purcha&s;ed at very rea&s;onable rates.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> There is &s;ettled upon the &s;ame very good Towns, and many out-Plantations, and good Buildings, good Orchards; and affords much Syder.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI> The Countrey is va&s;t and large, and wanteth nothing, &s;o much as People which would certainly be &s;upplied in a little time were this Di&s;crip|tion publi&s;hed, and the truth of it &s;o well known to many, as to my &s;elf, who am not capable at pre&s;ent (in re&s;pect of time, and this being only general) to de&s;cribe half of what may be for your and their encouragement. Onely this, that the difference is un&s;peakable (as I appeal to every Mans rea&s;on) between &s;ettling a Countrey remote from your Plantations (where cannot be expected any &s;peedy Supplies of Provi&s;ions, Milk, Cattle, and many other things; and that wherein is plenty of every thing already) I &s;hall de&s;i&s;t from giv|ing you further trouble at pre&s;ent, and take leave to &s;ub&s;cribe,</P>

<HEAD>The Di&s;cription of AMERICA, By JOHN OGILBIE, Printed in the Year 1671. In his Book, Fol. 168.181.182.</HEAD>
<P>WE&s;tward of <HI>After-skull-River</HI> before mentioned, about 18. or 20. miles, runs in <HI>Rariton-River</HI> Northward, into the Countrey &s;ome &s;cores of miles, both &s;ides of which River are adorned with &s;pacious Meadows, enough to feed thou&s;ands of Cattle. The Wood-land is very good for Corn, and &s;tored with wild Bea&s;ts, as Deer, Elks, and an innumerable multitude of Fowl, as in other parts of the Coun|trey. This River is thought very capable for the erecting of &s;e|veral Towns, and Villages on each &s;ide of it; no place in the North of <HI>America</HI> having better convenience for the maintain|ing of all &s;orts of Cattle for Winter and Summer food.</P>
<P>Upon this River is no Town &s;ettled, onely one at the mouth of it; but next to it, We&s;tward, is a place called <HI>Hewa&s;ons,</HI> where are 2. or 3. Towns and Villages &s;ettled upon the Sea-&s;ide, but none betwixt that and <HI>Delawar-Bay,</HI> which is about 60. miles, all which is a Rich Champain Countrey, free from Stones, and indifferent levell, having &s;tore of excellent good Timber, and very well Watered, having Brooks, or Rivers, ordinarily, one or more in every miles travel. This Countrey is Peopled onely with wild Bea&s;ts, as Deers, Elks, Bears, and other Creatures; &s;o that in a whole dayes journey, you &s;hall meet with no Inha|bitants, except a few <HI>Indians.</HI> It is al&s;o full of &s;tately Oaks, who&s;e broad-branch-tops &s;erve for no other u&s;e, but to keep off the Suns heat from the wild Bea&s;ts of the Wilderne&s;s, where is

How many poor People in the World would think them&s;elves happy, had they 1. Acre or 2. of Land? whil&s;t there is hundred, nay thou&s;ands of Acres that would invite Inhabi|tants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude our Di&s;cour&s;e of this Countrey, with a notable Character given hereof by a late Writer, as to the great <HI>Advantage of Happy living in all re&s;pects, for who&s;oever &s;hall be plea&s;ed to betake him&s;elf thither to live.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">If there be any Terre&s;tical Happine&s;s <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> to be had by any People, e&s;pecially of an inferiour Rank, it mu&s;t certainly be here. Here any one may furni&s;h him&s;elf with Land, and live Rent-free; yea, with &s;uch a quantity of land, that he may weary him&s;elf with walking over his Fields of Corn, and all &s;orts of Grain; and let his &s;tock a|mount to &s;ome hundreds, he needs not fear their want of Pa&s;ture in the Summer, and Fodder in the Winter; the Woods affording &s;ufficient Supply, where you have Gra&s;s as high as a Mans Knees; nay, as high as his Wea&s;t, interlaced with Pea-vines, and other weeds, that Cattle much delight in, as much as a Man can pa&s;s through. And the&s;e Woods al&s;o every mile, or half mile, are furni&s;hed with Fre&s;h Ponds, Brooks, or Rivers, where all &s;orts of Cattle, during the heat of the day, do quench their thir&s;t and cool them&s;elves. The&s;e Brooks and Rivers being In|viron'd of each &s;ide with &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, and Grape-Vines, Arbor-like interchanging places, and cro&s;&s;ing the&s;e Rivers, do &s;hade, and &s;helter them from the &s;corching beams of the Sun. Such as by their utmo&s;t labours can &s;carcely get a living, may here procure Inheritances of Lands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;tock them&s;elves with all &s;orts of Cattle, enjoy the benefit of them whil&s;t they live, and leave them their
<PB N="7" REF="6"><!-- PDF PAGE 70 -->Children, when they die. Here you need not trouble the Shambles for meat, nor Bakers, and Brewers for Bear and Bread, nor run to a Linnen-draper for a &s;upply; every one making their own Linnen, and a great part of their Wol|len Cloath for their ordinarie wearing. And how prodigal (if I may &s;o &s;ay) hath Nature been to furni&s;h this Countrey with all &s;ort of wild Bea&s;ts and Foul, which every one hath an intere&s;t in; and may hunt at his plea&s;ure; where, be&s;ides the plea&s;ure in hunting, he may furni&s;h his hou&s;e, with ex|cellent fat Veni&s;on, Turkies, Gee&s;e, Heath-Hens, Crans, Swans, Dukes, Pigeons, and the like, and wearied with that, he may go a Fi&s;hing, where the Rivers are &s;o furni&s;hed, that he may &s;upply him&s;elf with Fi&s;h, before he can leave of the Recreation. Here one may travel by land upon the &s;ame continent hundreds of miles, and pa&s;s through Towns, and Villages, and never hear the lea&s;t complaint for want, nor hear any ask him for a farthing. Here one may lodge in the Fields, and Woods, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">travel from one end of the countrey to another, with as much &s;ecurity as if he were lock'd within his own Chamber. And if one chance to meet with an <HI>Indian-town,</HI> they &s;hall give him the be&s;t en|tertainment they have, and upon his de&s;ire direct him on his way. But that which adds happinn&s;s to all the re&s;t, is the healthfulne&s;s of the place, where many people in twenty years time never knew what &s;ickne&s;s is, where they look upon it as a great mortality if two or threee die out of a Town in one years time. Be&s;ides the &s;weetne&s;s of the air, the coun|trey it &s;elf &s;ends forth &s;uch a fragrant &s;mell, that it may be perceived at Sea, before they can make to land; no evil Fog or Vapour doth any &s;onner appear, but a <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> or <HI>We&s;terly</HI> wind immediately de&s;olve it away. Moreover, you &s;hal &s;carce &s;ee a hou&s;e, but the <HI>South-&s;ide</HI> is begirt with hyves of Bees, which increa&s;e after an incredible manner. So that, if there be any <HI>Terre&s;tical Canaan,</HI> it is &s;urely here, where the land floweth with <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Hony.</HI></Q></P>
