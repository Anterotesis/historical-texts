<P>THe Emba&s;&s;adours of the United Provinces ha|ving been long in Treaty with the Parliament, and yet notwith&s;tanding have given no rea&s;onable &s;a|tisfaction to the ju&s;t demands of this Common-wealth, and being &s;ince remanded by their ma&s;ters the States; his
<PB N="4" REF="3">Excellency General Blake thought it not good any longer to protract time, but vigorou&s;ly (for the honour of this Common-wealth) to pro&s;ecute the work in hand, and to fight the Hollanders where&s;oever he can meet them; with this re&s;olution he &s;et &s;ail with a gallant Fleet of &s;hips towards the Northern &s;eas, there to di&s;turb and give a check to the in&s;olency of the Dutch, whom he un|der&s;tood in great numbers to be fi&s;hing upon our Eng|li&s;h &s;eas; leaving Sir George A&s;cue to command the re&s;t of the Fleet in the Downs.</P>
<P>He had not &s;ailed far, but that he made a di&s;covery of certain Hollanders, whom he pur&s;ued &s;o clo&s;e that he for|ced them to ingage, and after &s;ome &s;mal di&s;pute, he boar|ded four, two whereof were men of war, the other were Marchants &s;hips, laden with many rich commodities, all the re&s;t were di&s;per&s;ed up and down, being not able in that ha&s;t to keep company with each other.</P>
<P>His Excellency then &s;et forward in his cour&s;e North|ward, and according to his intelligence, he found the Dutch fi&s;hing, with many men of war that attended them for their pre&s;ent guard, and to convoy them home; his Excellency comming near them, &s;aluted them fir&s;t with one &s;ingle gun, thereby willing them (it being the cu&s;tome at &s;ea) to lore their Top-&s;ails, and &s;ubmit to the Common-wealth of England, but (their &s;pirits being heightned with the pre&s;umption of their own &s;trength) they refu&s;ed, an&s;wering him with a broad &s;ide, and af|ter that with another, whereupon both parties inga|ged, maintaining a gallant di&s;pute with great re&s;olution, for a good &s;pace; for having before elevated their &s;pi|rits with Brandy wine, <HI>viz.</HI> Strong-water, they &s;tout|ly maintained their decks; but it plea&s;ed the Lord of Ho&s;ts at la&s;t to crown our Fleet with victory, &s;o that they &s;unk two, took four, all men of war, with about an

<P>WE heare no talk now but of making great prepa|rations to defend our &s;elves and &s;hips again&s;t your &s;hips, who we hear take all they can meet withall at &s;ea; this hath cau&s;ed a generall alarm throughout the Coun|trey, and men and money are rai&s;ing apace to make our party good again&s;t you; for by your la&s;t an&s;wer given to our Emba&s;&s;adors with you, we do conceive that you in|tend war to this State; who in mo&s;t places of this Coun|try are no ways &s;orry for it; for till we have beaten you at &s;ea, we think we &s;hall never be able with treating to bring you to accept of &s;uch terms of our own, as we have given to other nations by being Ma&s;ters at &s;ea. We think out &s;elves capable and &s;ufficient to do it, or el&s;e we would never have begun with you: and whereas you expect &s;a|tisfaction, we may chance to demand the like of you with double intere&s;t for the charges you have now put us to, by your lofty carriage at &s;ea, this hath &s;o much in|cen&s;ed our common &s;ort of people, that unle&s;&s;e &s;ome &s;udden cour&s;e be taken by the Magi&s;trates to right them again&s;t the Engli&s;h, they will rai&s;e in&s;urrections, and re|venge them&s;elves on the Magi&s;trates, who dare hardly walk the &s;treets for fear of being mi&s;u&s;ed by the peeple in generall.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Promi&s;ed you an account of the laying down of arms by the enemy upon this la&s;t agreement; but my pud|dering bu&s;ine&s;s doth &s;o turmoil me, that I know not whe|ther I have performed that task or no, my fickle memo|ry in the hurty of affairs, doth not inform me concerning my performance of that promi&s;e; but to be &s;ure, I &s;ha&s; now give you a full account, as briefly as may be: Dun|gon, Scurlock, We&s;tmeath, and the Lord of Clonma|leer, did bring in part of the forces, in all about the num|ber of 800 at the mo&s;t; the re&s;t, being near &s;o many thou&s;ands, &s;till doth refu&s;e to &s;ubmit, being they are not pardoned for their murthers, and we are as well conten|ted that the war is now clearly &s;tated upon that account. The Lord of Clanrickard is about Letrim with a con&s;i|derable Army, my Lord Pre&s;ident, and Commi&s;&s;ary General Reynolds, are both at Slego to take that in, Colo|nel Venables is fortifying Belturbet, the Lieut. General, and Major General, and the Lord of Broghil are all gone into Kerry to &s;ubdue Muskerry: The Lord Taaff is here|abouts with the Byrons, Coales, Conways and Grace, who all keep in &s;everal great fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and by means of the great Woods and Mountains, ea&s;ily e&s;cape me; but I am fortifying &s;everal places near them, and now an fi|ni&s;hing Tullon, from whence I newly came hither for &s;ome accommodations to fortifie Dedrum. As I lay at Tullon la&s;t week, there was an ambu&s;h laid by Captain
<PB N="7" REF="4">Conway, and Captain Line, for Collonel Pritty, who was comming from Carlow to me, with a guard of ren hor&s;e: I did hear of it, and di&s;patched away two parties from my Camp; the enemy had engaged Collonel Prit|ty, killed two, and took Captain Miller and four Troo|pers pri&s;oners, but Collonel Pritty e&s;caped; the parties di&s;patched out pur&s;ued them clo&s;e, and killed four, relea|&s;ed Captain Miller, took Captain Line and one more, and &s;ixteen good hor&s;es, their riders e&s;caped in the Bogs. That night I &s;ent out a party of hor&s;e and foot to the Bri&s;|cales, who killed above fourty, and took thirty good hor&s;e, and returned; here Mr. Phelim &s;ent his Trumpet|ter to me for to grant Captain Line a Parol, I returned him no an&s;wer, owning him as a murtherer and wood|kern, and upon that &s;core intend to pro&s;ecute him, &s;ent him word that I would not give nor take quarter with him, nor any of his party, and by a Proclamation which I &s;ent him by his Trumper, offered 200 li. for any to ex|ecute him upon his own lentence of not comming in up|on the Agreement, but &s;tanding out as a murtherer, there|fore if any &s;hould bring me his body or head, I would give them 200. li.</P>

<P>Since I writ this Letter, I have certain intelligence, that Slego is &s;urrendred, and that Sir Theophilus Jones with a party of Hor&s;e of Dragoons, killed two Collonels, ten Captains, and three hundred of a party of three thou&s;and he met with in the County of Cavan, and took all their hor&s;e; and that the Liev. Gen. Ludlow fell upon a party of the enemy near the Lough, killed many, took a great quantity of powder and ammunition, and 60 hor&s;e.</P>

<P>From the Downs we received intelligence, that Sir George A&s;cue, whom Generall Blake left to command the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h Fleet in the Downs, is very act|ive and vigilant to di&s;charge the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and receiving intelligence of about 45 fail of Hollanders, that were on the coa&s;t of France, he re&s;olved to fight them; &s;o &s;etting &s;ail towards them, it was not long before he de&s;|cried them, and comming near them, he pre&s;ented them with a broad-&s;ide, they an&s;wered him with the like, whereupon hapned a very de&s;perate ingagement, but af|ter a very hot and bloudy di&s;pute, which continued for about 2 hours with great gallantry and re&s;olution, Sir G. A&s;cue became victor, took 7 of them, &s;unk and burned four, and forced about twenty four more of them to run on ground on the French &s;hore, all which we conceive cannot po&s;&s;ible e&s;cape &s;hipwrack. The re&s;t of the Hol|landers Sir George is in very hot pur&s;uit of. It is repor|ted by &s;ome that the Rubey is &s;unk, which (if true) would prove a very great lo&s;&s;e, &s;he carrying 42 guns, and about 480 men. It is al&s;o reported that Vantrump hath &s;ent a letter to Gen Blake, wherein he challengeth him to fight him upon equall terms, upon the coa&s;t of Flanders or the narrow &s;eas; but it is believed his heart will hardly &s;erve him to make good his challenge.</P>
