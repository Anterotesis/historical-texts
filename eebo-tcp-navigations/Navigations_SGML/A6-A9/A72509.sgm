<P>_THis Booke faire written (in gifte) lately &s;ent vn|to mee, doo J fayre prin|ted (by dedication) now &s;ende and commend vnto you.</P>
<P>I knowe not (in re&s;pect of the place) vnto whom I may more fitly thus &s;end it then vnto you, that are eyther bred &amp; wel brought vp here, or by the good|ne&s;&s;e of God and your own good proui|&s;ion, are well &s;etled here: and here lawfullye po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, or are neere vnto &s;undrie of tho&s;e things, that this booke &s;pecially &s;peaketh of: and thus, as of your &s;elfes, doe you &s;ee what they are now, and thus as of this booke, may you knowe why they were, and by whome they were, and what they were long agone.</P>
<P>I knowe not (in re&s;pect of the per|&s;ons,)
<PB REF="3"> vnto who~ I may more fitly thus &s;end it, then vnto you: with whome, I haue ben best and longest acquainted: from who~ (by points of &s;ingular cour|te&s;ie) I haue been many wayes muche plea&s;ured: Toward whom, for the ge|nerall coniunction and a&s;&s;ociation of your minds, and your &s;elfes in good a|mitie and familiaritie, one toward an other: and all, in good zeale towarde the aduancement of Christian religio~: and for the indifferent and di&s;crete cour&s;e ye keepe in handling and com|pounding &s;uch controuer&s;ies, as many times fall (and thereby in nouri&s;hing peace, a Iewel mo&s;t precious) betwene your hone&s;t and tractable neighbours, (things vnto almightie God, very ac|ceptable: vnto her Maie&s;tie, very grat+full: vnto your countrie, very fruitful: vnto your &s;elfes, very commendable:) Towarde whom, I &s;ay, for the&s;e cau&s;es
<PB REF="3"> which, as a member of this Cou~tie with others I &s;ee ioyfully and generally: and for the two first cau&s;es which deriued fro~ you, light vpon me &s;elf particular|ly, I haue ben, and am, and mu&s;t be ve|ry louingelye affected.</P>
<P>I know not how I may more fitly and effectually commend it the~ to &s;ay, that it is in &s;ub&s;tance, an hystorie: treating of the partes (and actions of greatest weight a good time together, done by the most famous per&s;ons) of one &s;peci|all Countrie: fet fro~ great antiquitie, which many men are much delighted with: out of &s;undry bookes with great &s;tudie collected, painfully: by this au|thoure in the matter &s;et out, truely: with good words wel placed, eloquent|ly. In commendation of this booke, vpon a fit occa&s;ion, the like in a man|ner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexander Neuil, Norwicus.</NOTE> is in Latine lately written by a Gentleman of our Countrie, knowne
<PB REF="4"> to be very honest, and, I thinke, very well learned: and &s;o vnder the au|thoritie of his good iudgement, may I (without blame) the more boldly co~|mend it vnto you.</P>
<P>What vtilitie foloweth the &s;tudie of Hystories, many of them haue well declared that haue publi&s;hed hysto|ries writte~ by theim &s;elfes, or haue &s;et out Hy&s;tories written by others. And therefore already &s;ufficiently done, I neede not (vnlearned mee &s;elfe, I can not) therein &s;ay muche. And yet thus much I may breefely &s;ay, and fit for the thing I haue in hande (me thinketh) I muste needes &s;ay, that (the &s;acred word of Almightie God alwayes excepted) there is nothing ei|ther for our instruction more profita|ble, or to our mindes more delectable, or within the compa&s;&s;e of common vn|derstanding more ea&s;ie or facile, then
<PB REF="4"> the &s;tudie of hystories: nor that &s;tudie for none estate more meete, the~ for the estate of Gentlemen: nor for the Gen|tlemen of Englande, no Hystorie &s;o meete, as the Hystorie of England. For, the dexteritie that men haue ey|ther in prouiding for theim&s;elfes, or in comforting their freendes (two very good things) or in &s;eruing their King and Countrie (of all outward things, the best thing) doth rest cheefly vpon their awne &amp; other folks experience: which I may a&s;&s;uredly accompt (for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Tho|mas Moore Knight, in the hy&s;to|rie of King Richard the thirde.</NOTE> in an hy&s;torie, in our tong as wel written as any thing euer was, or I thinke euer &s;halbe, <HI>great experience</HI> deriued fro~ a proofe of two &s;uch things, as pro&s;pe|ritie and aduer&s;itie be, vpon a fit occa|&s;io~ vnder the per&s;on of a very wi&s;ema~, is rightly accou~ted) to be the very mo|ther and mai&s;tres of wi&s;dome. Now that that a number of folkes doth ge|nerally,
<PB REF="5"> is much more then that, that any one of vs can do &s;pecially, and &s;o by other folks experie~ce, are we taught largely: and that, that other folkes for their King, their cou~trie, theim&s;elfes, their friends, like good men do vertu|ou&s;ly, ought to prouoke vs with good de+uotion inwardly to loue theim: &amp; with good words openly much to commende theim, and in their vertuous actions, rightly to folow theim. And that, that other folkes again&s;t their King, their countrie, their friends (and &s;o again&s;t theim &s;elfes) like fooli&s;h men do igno|rantly, or like leude men do wickedly, ought to moue vs fir&s;t (as our neigh|bours) Chri&s;tianly to bewaile theim: and the~ (as by pre&s;idents of peril pro|cured through their awne follies and faults) dutifully and wi&s;ely to beware by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m. And &s;o by the&s;e mens experi|ence (which like the burnt childe, that
<PB REF="5"> then too late the fire dreadthe) with much repentaunce they bye deerely) are we taught and brought out of da~|ger to &s;ettle our &s;elues, as it were, in a &s;eate of &s;uretie. Thus you &s;ee what ex|perience doth, and thus you &s;ee where other folkes experience is to be had: which, for the good e&s;tate of England (re&s;ting chiefly vpon the good iudge|ment and &s;eruice of the Gentlemen of England) is as J thinke, mo&s;t proper|ly fet from the Hy&s;torie of England. And this for this purpo&s;e, I &s;ay bothe vnto you my country men the Gentle|men of this Countie (a portion of the Realme) &s;pecially, and to al the Gen|tlemen of the whole Realme be&s;ide, generally.</P>
<P>There re&s;teth that for this booke (whiche I doe vpon the&s;e re&s;pectes thus &s;end, and with the&s;e rea&s;ons thus commende vnto you) we &s;houlde vnto
<PB REF="6"> the Authour <HI>William Lambard,</HI> yeelde oure verye hartie and perpe|tuall thankes: as oure Country man in our wordes and deedes louingly v&s;e him: as a man learned, duely e|&s;teeme him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathewe Parker Archebi|&s;hop of Canterbu|ry in his Preface to the Booke de rebus ge+&s;tis Aelfre|di Regis.</NOTE> (for a late very well lear|ned and reuerend father hath publi|quely and rightly &s;o reputed him) as a Gentleman religious and very ho|nest, make righte accompt of him: whiche, for my parte, I thinke meete to do, and meane to do: and for your partes, I de&s;ire heartely you &s;hould do, and I hope a&s;&s;uredly you will do. And if by you he might (and woulde) be moued at his good ley&s;ure, to doe as muche for all the rest of the Counties of this Realme generally, as he hathe done for this Countie &s;pecially (toward whiche J knowe, by great paine and good co&s;t, he hath alredy vnder the ti|tle of <HI>a Topographical dictionarie</HI>
<PB REF="6"> gathered together greate &s;tore of very good matter) him&s;elfe (the Authour of it) were worthy of good reward, &amp; &s;ingular commendation for it. You (the motioners) in the reading, &s;hall receiue great plea&s;ure by it: the rest of the Gentleme~ of this Realme, that of them&s;elfes &s;ee what things in their awne cou~tries are of gretest fame now, &amp; by that boke &s;hal know, what tho&s;e things and other things were long a|gone, must needes with great delight receiue it: and &s;urely, being as he is vnto mee, a very deere freende, for myne awne parte, J meane al&s;o (God willing) vpon &s;ome fit occa&s;ion, with my request to further it. <HI>The xvj. of Aprill. 1576.</HI> Your Countrey man and very louing friende.</P>

<P>TO the ende, that it may be vnder&s;toode, what is ment by the tearmes of <HI>Ea&s;t&s;axons, We&s;t&s;axons, Mercia, Northumberland,</HI> and &s;uch other, of which there is com|mon mention in the Treati&s;e folowing: I haue thought good to prefixe a chard of the &s;eauen &s;undry Kingdomes into the whiche this Realme was &s;ometime diuided. But yet, for the better and more plaine explication of the matter, it &s;hall bee good fir&s;t to know, that all the&s;e Nations following haue had to doe within this our Countrie: The <HI>Brittons,</HI> the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the <HI>Scottes</HI> and <HI>Pictes,</HI> the <HI>Saxons,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Normanes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bry|taines.</NOTE></P>

<P>The&s;e therefore weare by <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;ubdued to the <HI>Romane</HI> Empyre, and their country made a tributarie Prouince: in whiche ca&s;e it continued many yeares to|geather, vntyll at the length they being greiuou&s;ly vexed with the <HI>Pictes</HI> and <HI>Scottes</HI> their neighbours on the North, and being vtterly voide of all hope of aide to bee had from the <HI>Romanes</HI> their patrons (who al&s;o at the &s;ame time weare &s;ore afflicted with the inua&s;ion of the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> and <HI>Vandales,</HI> like barbarous nations) they weare enforced to &s;&eacute;eke for further helpe: And therefore &s;ent into <HI>Germanie,</HI> from whence they receaued hyred

<HEAD>&para; A short coun&s;ell, as touching the Brytti&s;he hy&s;torie.</HEAD>
<P>_ALbeit that I am iu&s;tly occa&s;ioned (before I make myne entrie) to &s;peake largely, for confirmation of the credite of oure <HI>Brytti&s;he</HI> or <HI>Wel&s;he hy&s;torie,</HI> (the faith wherof is by <HI>William Petite,</HI> and <HI>Poli|dore Virgile</HI> called into que&s;tion) for as muche, as I &s;hal be enforced to v&s;e it as a ground worke of my whole frame and building: yet for that I mynde not in any part of this my labour, to handle with many wordes, matters in controuer&s;ie, (being otherwi&s;e &s;uffi|ciently charged with things more incident to my pur|po&s;e, and no le&s;&s;e fit to be knowne.) And bycau&s;e al&s;o that matter hath alreadie founde more learned and dili|gent <HI>patrones,</HI> I will with fewe wordes pa&s;&s;e it ouer, contenting my &s;elfe, if I &s;hall haue added to other mens heapes, one &s;mall proofe or twaine, whiche by chaunce I gleaned after them, and referring &s;uche as de&s;ire more aboundant te&s;timonies, to the reading of <HI>Iohn Leland,</HI> and Syr <HI>Iohn ap Re&s;e,</HI> two learned men, that haue plen+tifully written therein.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the matter is this, whether <HI>Geffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouthe</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Geffray of Monmouth</NOTE> be the authour of the <HI>Brytti&s;h</HI> &s;torie (as <HI>William Newborow,</HI> and <HI>Polydore</HI> charge him) or the <HI>tran&s;latour</HI> thereof onely out of the <HI>Brytti&s;he,</HI> as him &s;elfe in his booke profe&s;&s;eth. Whereof mu&s;t n&eacute;edes en|&s;ue, That if the worke be his owne, it hath no more credite, then he him &s;elfe (being the author) coulde bring vnto it: But if he did only tran&s;late that, whiche <HI>Wal|ter</HI> the <HI>Archdeacon</HI> of <HI>Oxforde</HI> brought out of <HI>Norma~|die,</HI> and deliuered vnto him, Then doth not y^e e&s;timation
<PB N="60" REF="44"> depende vpon <HI>Geffray,</HI> but vpon &s;ome other (wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;oe|uer he were) that fir&s;t wrate it.</P>
<P>Now, that it may appeare vnto you, that he was on|ly the interpreter of that whiche came out of <HI>Norman|die,</HI> I will call to witne&s;&s;e, <HI>Henrie</HI> the <HI>Archdeacon</HI> of <HI>Huntington,</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>king Henrie</HI> the fir&s;t, and was &s;omwhat before <HI>William Petites</HI> dayes, who (as him &s;elf confe&s;&s;eth) was borne in the beginning of the reigne of <HI>king Stephan,</HI> about whiche time <HI>Gef|fray</HI> of <HI>Monmouthe</HI> was on liue al&s;o.</P>
<P>This <HI>Henrie</HI> (be&s;ides a learned hy&s;torie of the realme) wrate thr&eacute;e &s;euerall <HI>treati&s;es</HI> whiche I haue &s;&eacute;ene: One intituled, <HI>De miraculis Angliae:</HI> An other, <HI>De &s;erie Regu~ potenti&s;&s;imorum:</HI> And the thirde, <HI>De origine Regum Bry|tannorum.</HI> In this latter, he &s;ayth playnly. That at &s;uch time as he trauayled towardes <HI>Rome,</HI> he founde (in an auncient Librarie of the <HI>Abbay</HI> of <HI>Bec</HI>) an olde booke, in|tituled likewi&s;e, <HI>De origine Regum Brytannoru~,</HI> the which beginning at the arriuall of <HI>Brute,</HI> ended with the actes of <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> and agr&eacute;ed thoroughout (as by collatio~ I collected) with this our <HI>Brytti&s;he</HI> hy&s;torie, which I doubt whether <HI>Henrie</HI> of <HI>Huntington</HI> had euer &s;&eacute;ene. Nowe therefore, if this were an olde booke in his time, it coulde not be newe in the dayes of <HI>Petite,</HI> that &s;ucc&eacute;eded him: And if the argument were written before in the <HI>Bryt|ti&s;h</HI> tongue, it is very probable, that he was not the fir&s;t author, but only the tran&s;lator thereof in <HI>Latine.</HI> For further likelyhoode whereof, I my &s;elfe haue an aunci|ent <HI>Brytti&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Wel&s;he</HI> copy, which I re&s;erue for &s;hew, and doe reuerence for the antiquitie, litle doubting, but that it was written before the dayes of <HI>William Petite,</HI> who, as he was the fir&s;t, So vpon the matter recken I him the onely man, that euer impugned the <HI>Brytti&s;he</HI> hy&s;torie. For as touching <HI>Polydore</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polydore.</NOTE> (though he were a
<PB N="61" REF="44"> man &s;ingularly well learned) yet &s;ince hee was of our owne time, and no longer &s;ince, his forces mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity be thought to b&eacute;e bent, rather again&s;t the veritie, then again&s;t the antiquitie of that writing. Wherein if he &s;hall &s;eeke to di&s;credit the whole worke, for that in &s;ome partes it conteineth matter, not only vnlikely, but incredible al&s;o: then &s;hall he bothe depriue this Nation of all manner of knowledge of their fir&s;t beginning, and open the way for vs al&s;o to cal into que&s;tion the origine, and antiquities of <HI>Spaine, Fraunce, Germanie,</HI> yea and of <HI>Italie</HI> his owne countrie: in which, that whiche <HI>Liuie</HI> reporteth of <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus, Numa</HI> and <HI>Aegeria,</HI> is as farre remoued from all &s;u&s;picion of truthe, as any thing, what&s;oeuer y^e <HI>Galfride</HI> writeth, either of <HI>Brute, Merlin,</HI> or <HI>King Arthur</HI> him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>S&eacute;eing therefore, that euen as corne hath his chaffe, and metall his dro&s;&s;e, &s;o can there harldly any wryter of the auncient hy&s;torie of any nation be founde out that hath not his propre vanities mixed with &s;incere veritie: the part of a wi&s;e Reader &s;halbe, not to reiect the one for doubt of the other, but rather with the fire and fan, of iudgement and di&s;cretion, to trie and &s;ift them a &s;un|der. And as my purpo&s;e is for mine owne parte, to v&s;e the commoditie thereof, &s;o oft, as it &s;hall like me: &s;o my coun&s;ell &s;halbee, that other men will, bothe in this and other, ob&s;erue this one rule, <HI>That they neither reiect without rea&s;on, nor receiue without di&s;cretion, and iudgement.</HI></P>
<P>Thus muche in my way, for a&s;&s;ertion of the <HI>Brytti&s;h hy&s;torie</HI> I thought good to &s;ay once for all, to the ende that from hencefoorthe (what&s;oeuer occa&s;ion of debate &s;halbe offered, concerning eyther the veritie or antiqui|tie of the &s;ame) I neither trouble my &s;elfe, nor tarrie my Reader, with any further defence, or <HI>Apologie.</HI></P>

<P>It is to be &s;&eacute;ene, in the <HI>Britti&s;he</HI> hy&s;torie, and others, that at &s;uche time as King <HI>Lucius</HI> (the fir&s;t chri&s;tened Prince of this land) had renounced the damnable dark|nes of <HI>Pagani&s;me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Flamines turned into Bi&s;hops.</NOTE> and embra&s;ed the glorious light of the Go&s;pel of God, he chaunged the <HI>Archeflamines</HI> of London, Yorke, and <HI>Caerleon,</HI> into &s;o many Archebi|&s;hops: and the <HI>Flamines,</HI> of other inferiour places, into inferiour Bi&s;hops, through out his whole realme. How+beit, this matter is not &s;o cleare, but that it is encounte|red by <HI>William Petit,</HI> whiche (in the Proheme of his hy&s;torie) affirmeth boldly, that the Britons whiche pro|fe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian religion within this Iland, before y^e co~|ming of <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> were contented with Bi&s;hops only, &amp; that <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> him&s;elfe was the very fir&s;t, that euer had the Archbi&s;hops <HI>Palle</HI> among&s;t vs. As touching Bi+&s;hops it is euide~t by <HI>Beda</HI> him &s;elf, that both before, &amp; in

<HEAD>The Goodwine, or Good|vvine Sandes.</HEAD>
<P>_THere liued in the time of King <HI>Edwarde</HI> (commonly called the <HI>Confe&s;&s;our</HI>) a no|ble ma~,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earle God|wine and his &s;onnes.</NOTE> named <HI>Godwine,</HI> who&s;e daugh|ter <HI>Edgithe,</HI> the &s;ame King, by great in|&s;tance of his nobilitie, (being otherwi&s;e of him &s;elfe di&s;po&s;ed to haue liued &s;ole) tooke vnto his wife. By rea&s;on whereof, not onely this <HI>Godwine</HI> him &s;elfe (being at the fir&s;t but a Cowheards &s;onne, and afterward aduaunced to honour by King <HI>Ca|nutus,</HI> who&s;e &s;i&s;ter by fraude he obteined to wife) became of great power and authoritie within this Realme (but his &s;onnes al&s;o being fiue in nomber) were by the kings <MILESTONE N="1050"> gyfte, aduaunced to large liuelyhoodes and honourable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. For <HI>Goodwine</HI> was Earle of <HI>Kent, Su&s;|&s;ex, Ham&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, Deuon&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Cornwal:</HI> His elde&s;t &s;onne <HI>Swane,</HI> had <HI>Oxford&s;hire, Barke&s;hire Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et: Harold,</HI> helde <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Norfolk, Suffolke, Cambridge&s;hire,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hun|tingdon&s;hire: To&s;ti,</HI> had <HI>Northumberland:</HI> And <HI>Gurte,</HI> &amp; <HI>Leo&s;wine,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed other places. &amp;c.

The King pitying their cala|mitie, and &s;&eacute;eing that they might bee profitable to his Realme, by in&s;tructing his people in the art of clothing, (wherein at that time they chiefly excelled,) fir&s;t placed

It appeareth by the authors of that worke, that after &s;uche time as the King and the Bi&s;hop had long contended (and that with great heate) about the Statutes of <HI>Clarendune,</HI> &amp; that the Bi&s;hop, vpon great offence taken, had made thr&eacute;e &s;euerall attempts to cro&s;&s;e the Seas towarde the Pope, and was alwayes by contrarie winde repul&s;ed, and driuen to the lande againe: The King in his iu&s;t in|dignation, &s;ought by all po&s;&s;ible meanes to bridle his immoderate peui&s;hne&s;&s;e: &amp; therefore, fir&s;t re&s;umed into his owne handes, al &s;uch honors and ca&s;tles of his own as he had committed to y^e Bi&s;hops cu&s;todie: The~ called he an a&s;&s;embly of al his Nobilitie &amp; bi&s;hops to <HI>Northa~p+ton</HI> ca&s;tle, where before them all, he fir&s;t charged <HI>Tho|mas</HI> with <HI>.500.</HI> l. that he had long before lent him: for the repaiment wherof, he ther co~pelled him to giue fiue &s;e|ueral &s;ureties: This done, he called him to an account for <HI>.30000.</HI> Markes, receiued of the reuenues of the crown, during the time that he was Chancelour. Now, whiles the Archbi&s;hop was much troubled w^t this mat|ter (&s;ometime denying to yeald any account at al, &s;om|time

Thus muche out of the <HI>Quadriloge</HI> faithfully tran&s;lated. Nowe, vpon the whole matter it appeareth: fir&s;t, that the quarell was for the lawes of <HI>Clarend&ugrave;ne</HI> (whiche yet depended) and then, that, euen as a fire, being once kindled, the flame &s;&eacute;eketh all about, and imbraceth what&s;oeuer it findeth
<PB N="381" REF="208"> in the way: So the King being offended with the rebel|lion of this Bi&s;hop, left no &s;tone vntaken vp, that might be hurled at him, &amp; therefore brought in again&s;t him, bothe debts, accompts, and what&s;oeuer other meanes of annoyaunce. Moreouer, that this matter of <HI>Otford</HI> and <HI>Wingham</HI> (for as you nowe &s;&eacute;e it was not <HI>Otford</HI> alone) was not at all to&s;&s;ed betw&eacute;ene the King and the Archebi&s;hop, but only moued by the pacifiers (the&s;e two Bi&s;hops) as a m&eacute;ete meane of reconciliation, in their owne opinion and iudgement: or, if it may be thought, that they were &s;ent and &s;uborned by the King him&s;elfe with that deui&s;e: yet is it manife&s;t, that the right of the hou&s;es them&s;elues were not de&s;ired, but onely that they might remaine as a paine till the account were audi|ted: Neither if the gifte of this hou&s;e would haue made an end of the &s;trife, doth it by and by followe, that the contention was moued at the fir&s;t about it. And ther|fore as on the one &s;ide you may &s;&eacute;e, that <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> his reporte is but matter of Preface and no Go&s;pell: So yet on the other &s;ide it is euident, that of &s;uch and &s;o lu&s;|tie a &s;tomacke was this Archebi&s;hop, that if former cau&s;e had not b&eacute;ene, yet he could haue found in his hart to fall out with his Prince for this, or a &s;maller matter.</P>
<P>For, what would he not aduenture for a Manor or twaine in lawfull po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that would not &s;ticke to hazard his head before he would relea&s;e that right, whi|che he thought he had to a piece of land, and that but on|ly by heare&s;ay, or &s;uppo&s;ition?

<P>My other coniecture, is ray&s;ed vpon the con&s;ideration of the rent and &s;eruices going out of the&s;e landes: for it is wel knowne, that as <HI>Knights &s;eruice</HI> lande, required the pre&s;ence of the tenant, in warfare and battaile a|broad: So this lande (being of <HI>Socage</HI> tenure) co~maun|ded his attendance at the ploughe, and other the Lordes affaires of hu&s;bandry, at home: the one by manhoode de|fending his Lords life and per&s;on, the other by indu&s;trie mainteining with rent, corne, and victuall, his e&s;tate and familie.

In whiche behalfe, as I mu&s;t n&eacute;edes confe&s;&s;e, that the later condition hath rea&s;on, bycau&s;e it tendeth (though not fully) to the cor|rection of &s;inne and wickedne&s;&s;e: So yet dare I affirme, that the former is not onely not rea&s;onable, but meerely leud and irreligious al&s;o. For, although the Ethnickes did &s;o much magnifie wydowhood, that (as <HI>Valerius</HI> re|citeth) <HI>Faeminas, quae vno matrimonio contentae erant, corona pudicitiae honorabant,</HI> and although that the common law al&s;o (being directed by the Popi&s;he Clergie, whiche ther|in followed the errour of <HI>Ierome</HI>) dothe in another ca&s;e, by the name of <HI>Bigamie,</HI> di&s;like of a womans &s;econde marriage: Yet Sainct <HI>Paule</HI> &s;ayth plainely, <HI>Mulier, &s;i dormierit maritus eius, libera est, vt cui vult nubat, mod&ograve; in Domino.</HI> But yet for all this, &s;&eacute;eing that our treati&s;e of v&s;ages reciteth it, &s;&eacute;eing al&s;o that common experience of the countrey approueth it, and that the common lawe
<PB N="406" REF="222"> of the Realme (as it may be read, <HI>Praerogatiua Regis Cap. 16. &amp; <HI>2. H. 3. in Prae&s;cription. 59.</HI></HI>) admitteth it: let vs al&s;o for this place and purpo&s;e, be co~tented to number it among&s;t our cu&s;tomes, and &s;o proc&eacute;ed with the re&s;idue. It appeareth, by that whiche is already &s;ayde, that the common lawe, and this cu&s;tome, differ in two things concerning Dower: One, in that the common lawe gi|ueth but a thirde parte, whereas the cu&s;tome vouch&s;a|feth the halfe: Another, in that this cu&s;tome giueth con|ditionally, whereas the gifte of the common lawe, is fr&eacute;e and ab&s;olute. Nowe therefore, there remaine to be &s;hewed, certeine other pointes, wherein they varie al&s;o. As, if the hu&s;band commit Felonie: at the common law, his wife hath lo&s;t her title of Dower, but by the cu&s;tome of this countrey, &s;he &s;hall not loo&s;e her Dower for the faulte of her hu&s;bande, but only in &s;uche ca&s;e, where the heire &s;hall loo&s;e his inheritance, for the offence of his fa|ther. Which thing is manife&s;t, both by the treati&s;e of our <HI>Kenti&s;he</HI> cu&s;tomes, and by the opinion of the <HI>Court 8. H. 3. Prae&s;cription. 60.</HI> At the common lawe al&s;o, the wife &s;hall be endowed of a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in lawe, but (as me thinketh) &s;he &s;hall haue no Dower by this cu&s;tome, but onely of &s;uche landes, whereof her hu&s;band was ac|tually and really &s;ei&s;ed. For the wordes be <HI>(Des tene|ments, dount &s;on Baron moru&s;t &s;ei&s;et, et vestu,)</HI> which word <HI>(vestu)</HI> being cleane omitted in the imprinted booke, in|forceth a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in d&eacute;ede, and not in lawe only. And therefore, if landes in <HI>Gauelkinde</HI> de&s;cend to a married man, whiche dyeth before he make his entrie into the &s;ame, inquire whether it be the manner to endowe his wife therof, or no: for v&s;e is the only <HI>Oracle</HI> that in this ca&s;e I can &s;ende you vnto. Againe, at the common law, a woman &s;hal be endowed of a faire, or of any &s;uch other profit. But, (for as muche as the wordes of this
<PB N="407" REF="222"> cu&s;tomarie Dower, be <HI>(terres &amp; tenements)</HI> and for that all cu&s;tomes &s;hall finde a literall and &s;treight interpre|tatio~) the opinion of Mai&s;ter <HI>Parkins</HI> is, that no Dower lyeth of a faire, by this cu&s;tome. Furthermore, if the wife recouer her Dower at the common law, &s;he ought of nece&s;&s;itie to be endowed by metes and boundes: But in Dower after this cu&s;tome (&s;ayth the &s;ame authour) &s;he may very well be endowed of a moitie, to be holden in common with the heire, that inioyeth the other half. La&s;tly, this cu&s;tome, be&s;ides Dower of the one halfe of the hu&s;bandes lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dower of chattels.</NOTE> prouideth Dower of the moitie of &s;uche goods al&s;o, as he dyed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, if he had no chil|dren, and of the thirde part, though he leaue i&s;&s;ue: wher|as the common lawe (at the lea&s;t in common practi&s;e at this day) hath no con&s;ideration of any &s;uche endowme~t. The&s;e then be the differences, betw&eacute;ene the common lawe of the Realme, and the particular cu&s;tome of this countrey concerning Dower: the compari&s;on whereof, and whether &s;ort of Dower is more beneficiall, I will not now attempt, and much le&s;&s;e take vpo~ me, to deter|mine, lea&s;t I my &s;elfe might &s;&eacute;eme ra&s;hly to preiudicate in another thing, wherin I mo&s;t gladly de&s;ire to be iud|ged by other men: namely, whether a woman, intituled to Dower in <HI>Gauelkind,</HI> may waine her Dower of the moitie after this cu&s;tome, and bring her action to be en|dowed of the thirde at the common lawe, and &s;o exempt her &s;elfe from all danger of the&s;e cu&s;tomarie conditions, or no? The Re&s;olution of whiche doubte, will depend chiefly vpon compari&s;on, whether it be more aduaun|tage to her, to haue the thirde at the common lawe ab|&s;olutely, or the moitie by the cu&s;tome conditionally.</P>
<P>For if the Dower at the common law be better for her, then it &s;&eacute;emeth rea&s;onable that &s;he &s;hould &s;tande to the wor&s;e, whiche is the cu&s;tome: euen as tenant by the
<PB N="408" REF="223"> curte&s;ie, mu&s;t take the moitie that the cu&s;tome giueth, and not a&s;ke the whole, as Common lawe appointeth.</P>
<P>And yet thereto it may be replyed, that the ca&s;es be not like: for &s;o muche as that of <HI>Dower</HI> is much more to be fauoured. I my &s;elfe once heard two reuerend Iudges of opinion, that the woman was at libertie, to a&s;ke her Dower of the Thirde, or of the Moitie: But bycau&s;e it was vttered by them in a pa&s;&s;age of &s;oudaine &s;peache, and not &s;poken vpon &s;tudied argument, I will not v&s;e the authoritie of their names, to get the matter credite with all, but leaue it at large, to be better inquired of.</P>

And in all other things al&s;o, this cu&s;tomarie Gardein is to be charged and to haue allowance, in &s;uche &s;orte, and none other, then as the Gardein in &s;ocage at the common law is: Saue only (as it is partly remembred already) that he is bothe chargeable to y^e Heire in accompt for his re|ceipt, &amp; &s;ubiect al&s;o to y^e di&s;tre&s;&s;e of the Lord for y^e &s;ame cau&s;e:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardein, af|ter the cu&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ome.</NOTE> Yet doe I not heare, that the Lordes take vpon them (at this day) to committe the cu&s;todie of the&s;e In|fants, but that they leaue it altogether to the order of the next of the Kinne, the rather (belike) for that they
