<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>The &s;everal Names by which</HI> Orkney <HI>is call'd. The Longitude and Latitude of this Country An account of a Stone generated in the Air. How this Coun|try is bounded. Some odd Phaenomena about the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea. The number of the I&s;lands; and a &s;hort Account of each of them, with their different Harbours. The chief Products of this Country.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Country in our Engli&s;h Language is call'd <HI>Orkney;</HI> by the Latins, both Ancient and Modern, it is call'd <HI>Orcades. Pomponius Mela</HI> writes it with an a&s;pi|ration, <HI>Orchades.</HI> What rea&s;on there is for the Name is not conde&s;cended up|on, but it's probable the Latin Name may be from <HI>Orcas,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemy</HI> makes to be a Promontory of <HI>Cathnes</HI> over-again&s;t this Country, or from &s;ome
<PB N="2" REF="10">
Colony of the <HI>Picts,</HI> who fir&s;t Planted this Country, and from &s;ome Similitude with the Name whereby they call'd them&s;elves, might be &s;o call'd by the <HI>Romans.</HI> As for the Engli&s;h name <HI>Ork|ney,</HI> it may be derived from &s;ome Picti&s;h Prince, as <HI>Erick</HI> or <HI>Orkenwald,</HI> or &s;ome other who has been famous in the fir&s;t Plantation; or might have got the name from &s;ome remarkable Title which the fir&s;t Planters the <HI>Pights</HI> took to them|&s;elves; for <HI>Picts</HI> or <HI>Pights</HI> (as <HI>Ver&s;tegan</HI> &s;ays) in the Teutonick Tongue &s;ignifies Fighters; and <HI>Orkney</HI> may come from <HI>Ear,</HI> which &s;ignifies Honour, and <HI>Kyn,</HI> which &s;ignifies on Off-&s;pring, as if the name were intended to &s;hew, That they were an Off-&s;pring or Generation of Honour.</P>
<P>This Country lies in the Northern temperate Zone and thirteenth Cli|mate; the Longitude being 22 De|grees and 11 Minutes, and Latitude 59 Degrees and 2 Minutes, the Compa&s;s varying eight Degrees; &s;o that the length of the longe&s;t Day is eighteen Hours and &s;ome odd Minutes; yet not|with&s;tanding that this Country is &s;o far remov'd to the North, the Air is tem|perate and whol&s;ome, agreeing well
<PB N="3" REF="10">
with tho&s;e Con&s;titutions that can en|dure a little Cold. At Midnight it is &s;o clear for a great part of <HI>June,</HI> that one may read a Letter in his Chamber; yet it cannot be true what <HI>Bleau</HI> reports, That from the Hill of <HI>Hoy</HI> a Man may &s;ee the Sun at Midnight; for it cannot be the true Body of the Sun that is &s;een, but the Image of it refracted through &s;ome watry Cloud about the Horizon, &s;eeing it mu&s;t be as far depre&s;&s;ed un|der our Horizon in <HI>June,</HI> as it is elevated above it in <HI>December,</HI> which is by many Degrees; for from that Hill the Sun is to be &s;een in the &s;horte&s;t Day in <HI>December</HI> above five Hours.</P>
<P>The Air and Clouds here, by the o|peration of the Sun, do &s;ometimes gene|rate &s;everal things; as &s;ome Years &s;ince, &s;ome Fi&s;hermen Fi&s;hing half a League from Land, over-again&s;t <HI>Copin&s;ha,</HI> in a fair Day, there fell down from the Air a Stone about the bigne&s;s of a Foot-ball, which fell in the middle of the Boat and &s;prung a Leake, to the great dan|ger of the Lives of the Men that were in it, which could be no other than &s;ome Sub&s;tance generated in the Clouds. The Stone was like conden&s;ed or pe|trefied
<PB N="4" REF="11">
Clay, and was a long time in the cu&s;tody of Captain <HI>Andrew Dick,</HI> at that time Steward of this Country; and Cap|tain <HI>Dick,</HI> who is yet alive, told me he gave it to the late Earl of <HI>Glencairn.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Winters are generally more &s;ubject to Rain than Snow; nor does the Fro&s;t and Snow continue &s;o long here as in other parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Wind in the mean time will often blow very boi&s;terou&s;ly, and it Rains &s;ometimes not by drops but by &s;pouts of Water, as if whole Clouds fell down at once. In the Year 1680, in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> after great Thun|der, there fell flakes of Ice near a foot thick.</P>
<P>This Country is wholly &s;urrounded with the Sea, having <HI>Pightland-Firth</HI> on the South, the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Oce|an on the We&s;t, the Sea that divides it from <HI>Zetland</HI> on the North, and the German Sea on the Ea&s;t. <HI>Zetland</HI> &s;tands North-Ea&s;t and by Ea&s;t from <HI>Orkney,</HI> and from the Start of <HI>Sanda</HI> in <HI>Orkney</HI> to <HI>Swinburg</HI> Head the mo&s;t Southerly Point in <HI>Zetland</HI> is about eighteen leagues, where there is nothing but Sea all the
<PB N="5" REF="11">
way, &s;ave <HI>Fair I&s;le,</HI> which lies with|in eight Leagues of <HI>Swinburg-Head.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> which divides this Country from <HI>Cathnes,</HI> is in breadth from <HI>Duncansbay</HI> in <HI>Cathnes</HI> to the near|e&s;t point of <HI>South-Ronal&s;ha</HI> in <HI>Orkney</HI> about twelve Miles, in it are a great many different Tides, reckon'd to the number of twenty four, which run with &s;uch an impetuous force, that a Ship under &s;ail is no more able to make way again&s;t the Tide, than if it were hinder'd by a <HI>Remora,</HI> which I con|ceive is the rea&s;on why &s;ome have &s;aid they have found the <HI>Remora</HI> in the&s;e Seas.</P>
<P>In this Firth, about two Miles from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cathnes,</HI> lies <HI>Stroma,</HI> a lit|tle plea&s;ant I&s;land, but becau&s;e of its vicinity to <HI>Cathnes,</HI> and its being &s;till under the Juri&s;diction of the Lords of that Country, it is not counted as one of the I&s;les of <HI>Orkney.</HI> On the North-&s;ide of this I&s;le is a part of <HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> call'd the <HI>Swelchie</HI> of <HI>Stroma,</HI> and at the We&s;t-end of the I&s;le, betwixt it and <HI>Mey</HI> in <HI>Cathnes,</HI> there is another part of the Firth, call'd the <HI>Merry Men of Mey,</HI> both which are very dangerous to Sea|men.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12">
The Sea ebbs and flows here as in other places, yet there are &s;ome Phae|nomena, the rea&s;on of which cannot &s;o ea&s;ily be found out; as in the I&s;le of <HI>Sanda,</HI> it flows two hours &s;ooner on the We&s;t-&s;ide than it does on the Ea&s;t|&s;ide; and in North <HI>Faira</HI> (which lies betwixt <HI>Eda</HI> and <HI>We&s;tra)</HI> the Sea ebbs nine hours and flows but three: And at <HI>Hammone&s;s</HI> in <HI>Sanda,</HI> both ebb and flood run one way, except at the be ginning of a quick Stream, when for two or three hours the flood runs South.</P>
<P>The Sea here is very turbulent in a Storm, and unea&s;ie even to tho&s;e on Land, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e places of the Country that lie expos'd to <HI>Pightland-Firth,</HI> and the We&s;tern Ocean, for when the Storm beats that way, the Sea da|&s;hes with &s;uch violence again&s;t the Rocks, that a great deal of the Sea is carry'd (in &s;ome places near a quarter of a mile) on the Land, and falls like a great &s;hower of Rain on the Ground, which is very oft prejudicial to their Corn at certain Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">
The Tides al&s;o are very &s;wift and violent, by rea&s;on of the multitude of the I&s;les and narrowne&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;age; for, when all the re&s;t of the Sea is &s;mooth, the&s;e Tides carry their Waves and bil|lows high, and run with &s;uch violence that they cau&s;e a contrary motion in the Sea adjoyning to the Land, which they call <HI>Ea&s;ter-birth</HI> or <HI>We&s;ter-birth,</HI> according to its cour&s;e; yet notwith&s;tanding of the great rapidity of the&s;e Tides and Births, the Inhabitants, daily almo&s;t, travel from I&s;le to I&s;le about their &s;e|veral affairs in their little Cockboats or Yoals, as they call them.</P>
<P>Whatever the Ancients have written of the number of the I&s;lands of <HI>Orkney,</HI> it's certain there are but twenty &s;ix, at pre&s;ent inhabited, <HI>viz. South-Ronal&s;ha, Swinna, Hoy</HI> and <HI>Waes, Burra, Lamb|holm, Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gram&s;ey, Po|mona</HI> or <HI>Mainland, Copin&s;ha, Shapin&s;ha, Dam&s;ey, Inhallo, Stron&s;a, Papa-Stron&s;a, Sanda, North-Ronal&s;ha, Eda, Rou&s;a, Wyre, Gair&s;a, Egle&s;ha, North-Faira, We&s;tra, Papa-We&s;tra.</HI> The re&s;t of the I&s;lands are call'd <HI>Holms,</HI> and are only u&s;ed for Pa&s;ture; all of them being &s;eparated from one another by &s;ome narrow
<PB N="8" REF="13">
Streights. Mo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands names end in <HI>a</HI> or <HI>ey,</HI> which in the Teutonick &s;ignifieth Water, to &s;hew that the&s;e I&s;les are pieces of Land &s;urrounded with Water.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands are of different Natures, &s;ome Sandy, &s;ome Mar&s;h, &s;ome aboun|ding in Heath and Mo&s;s, and &s;ome that have none, &s;ome of them Mountainous and &s;ome Plain. Of the&s;e &s;ome are call'd the South-I&s;les, and others the North-I&s;les, and that as they &s;tand to the South or North of the greate&s;t I&s;land, call'd the <HI>Mainland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>South-Ronal&s;ha</HI> is the Southermo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands, five Miles long, fertile in Corn, and abounding with People. To the South-Ea&s;t lie the <HI>Pightland Sker|ries,</HI> dangerous to Seamen; but to the North is St. <HI>Margarets Hope,</HI> a very &s;afe Harbour for Ships, which has no diffi|culty in coming to it, &s;ave a Rock in the middle of the Sound, betwixt this I&s;land and <HI>Burra,</HI> call'd <HI>Lippa.</HI> From <HI>Burwick,</HI> in this I&s;le, is the u&s;ual Ferry to <HI>Duncansbay</HI> in <HI>Cathnes.</HI></P>
<P>A little &s;eparated from this, to the South-We&s;t, lies <HI>Swinna,</HI> a little I&s;le, and only con&s;iderable for a part of <HI>Pight</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="13">
<HI>land-Firth</HI> lying a little to the We&s;t of it, call'd the Wells of <HI>Swinna,</HI> which are two Whirlpools in the Sea (occa|&s;ion'd, as is thought, by &s;ome <HI>Hin|tus</HI> that is in the Earth below) that run about with &s;uch violence, that if any Boat or Ship come within their reach they will whirl it about and about till it be &s;wallow'd up and drown'd. They are only dangerous in a great Calm; for if there be any Wind, and the Boat under Sail, there is no danger to go over them. If a Boat happen to come near them in a Calm, by the force of the Tide driving that way, the Boats-men, for their pre&s;ervation throw a Barrel or an Oar, or any bulky thing that comes next to hand, into the Wells, and when it is &s;wallow'd up the Sea remains &s;mooth for a time for any Boat to pa&s;s over.</P>
<P>Beyond this, and to the We&s;t of <HI>South-Ronal&s;ha,</HI> lies <HI>Waes</HI> and <HI>Hoy</HI> (thought to be the <HI>Dumna</HI> of <HI>Pliny)</HI> which are but one I&s;le, about twelve Miles in length, full of high Mountains, and but thinly inhabited, unle&s;s in <HI>Waes,</HI> where the Ground is very plea&s;ant and fertile. From <HI>Snel&s;etter</HI> in <HI>Waes</HI> is the
<PB N="10" REF="14">

<P>To the North of <HI>South-Ronal&s;ha</HI> lies <HI>Burra,</HI> a plea&s;ant little I&s;le, fruitful in Corns and abounding in Rabbits. Be|twixt <HI>Burra</HI> and the <HI>Mainland</HI> is <HI>Lamb|holm,</HI> and to the We&s;t, towards <HI>Hoy|mouth,</HI> lies <HI>Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gram|&s;ey,</HI> all of them fruitful and plea&s;ant I|&s;lands, tho' they be not large.</P>
<P>Next to the&s;e is the <HI>Mainland,</HI> call'd by the Ancients <HI>Pomona</HI> or <HI>Pomonia,</HI> about twenty four Miles in length, and well inhabited. About the middle of this I&s;land, to the North, &s;tands <HI>Kirk|wall,</HI> the only Town in all this Coun|try. There are in the <HI>Mainland</HI> four excellent Harbours for Ships, one at <HI>Kirk|wall,</HI> both large and &s;afe, without any danger by Shoals or blind Rocks as they come to it, unle&s;s they come from the We&s;t by <HI>Inhallo</HI> and <HI>Gair&s;a:</HI> A|nother

Harbour is at <HI>Deir&s;ound,</HI> which is a great Bay, and a very &s;afe Road for Ships, having good anchoring ground, and capable of &s;heltering the greate&s;t Navies. The third is at <HI>Graham&s;hall,</HI> toward the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of this I&s;le, where there is a convenient Road; but the Ship that &s;ails to it from the Ea&s;t, would do well to keep betwixt <HI>Lamb|holm</HI> and the <HI>Mainland,</HI> for the other way betwixt <HI>Lambholm</HI> and <HI>Burra</HI> (which appears to them to be only open) is very &s;hallow and dangerous, even for &s;mall Ships. The fourth is at <HI>Kair|&s;ton,</HI> a &s;mall Village, at the We&s;t end of the <HI>Mainland,</HI> where there is a ve|ry &s;afe and commodious Harbour, well fenc'd again&s;t all Winds by two &s;mall <HI>Holms</HI> that &s;tand at the entry.</P>
<P>To the Ea&s;t of the <HI>Mainland</HI> lies <HI>Copin&s;ha,</HI> a little I&s;le, but very con&s;pi|cuous to Seamen, as is that <HI>Holm</HI> to the North-Ea&s;t of it, call'd the Hor&s;e of <HI>Copin&s;ha.</HI></P>
<P>To the North of the <HI>Mainland,</HI> lie the North-I&s;les, the fir&s;t of which is <HI>Shapin&s;ha,</HI> about five or &s;ix Miles in length, and hath a very &s;afe Harbour for Ships at <HI>Elwick.</HI></P>

<P>Beyond the&s;e, toward the North, at &s;ome di&s;tance, lies <HI>Sanda,</HI> about twelve Miles long, but very narrow, well in|habited; it hath two Roads for Ships, one at <HI>Kitletoft,</HI> guarded by a little Holm, call'd the Holm of <HI>El&s;nes,</HI> the o|ther at <HI>Otter&s;wick,</HI> guarded by the mo&s;t Northern-I&s;land in all this Country, call'd <HI>North-Ronal&s;ha,</HI> which is a little fruitful I&s;le, but both it and <HI>San|da</HI> have no Mo&s;s Ground, but are ob|liged to bring their Peits and Turfs (which is the only Fuel they have thorough this whole Country) a great way off, from the next adjacent I&s;land, <HI>Eda.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Eda</HI> lyeth to the South-Ea&s;t of <HI>Sanda,</HI> thought to be the <HI>Ocetis</HI> of <HI>Pto|lemy,</HI> near five Miles in length, full of Mo&s;s and Hills, but thinly inhabited, unle&s;s it be about the skirts of it; it

<P>Three Miles to the We&s;t of <HI>Kirk|wall,</HI> at the bottom of a large Bay, lies a little I&s;land, call'd <HI>Dam&s;ey,</HI> with a Holm near it as large as it &s;elf.</P>
<P>To the North North-We&s;t lies <HI>Rou|&s;a,</HI> about &s;ix Miles long, but very hil|ly and ill inhabited. Betwixt it and the <HI>Mainland</HI> lies <HI>Inhallo,</HI> and towards <HI>Kirkwall</HI> lies <HI>Wyre</HI> and <HI>Gair&s;a,</HI> &s;mall but profitable I&s;lands.</P>
<P>North from <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> at eight Miles di&s;tance, is <HI>Egle&s;ha,</HI> near three Miles in length, very plea&s;ant and fertile, having a &s;afe Road for Ships betwixt it and <HI>Wyre.</HI> In this I&s;le there is a little hand|&s;ome Church, where, it is &s;aid, that Saint <HI>Magnus,</HI> the Patron of this Country, lies Bury'd.</P>
<P>To the North of <HI>Egle&s;ha</HI> is <HI>We&s;tra,</HI> &s;even Miles long, plea&s;ant, fertile and well inhabited.

<P>There are no Trees any where in all this Country, except &s;ome few A&s;hes Thorn and Plumb Trees that are in the Bi&s;hops Garden in <HI>Kirkwal.</HI> There are in &s;ome Gentlemens Gardens in <HI>Kirk|wal,</HI> and &s;everal other places of the Country, &s;ome Apple and Cherry-trees, but they &s;eldom bear Fruit that comes to any maturity; and the Trees grow never higher than the Garden Walls. And, except &s;ome few wild Ro&s;es and Juniper that I &s;ee in <HI>Hoy,</HI> and the <HI>Myr|tillus</HI> and Heath, which is common eve|ry where, I don't remember to have &s;een any Bu&s;h or Shrub growing wild
<PB N="35" REF="26">
in all the Country. Yet in a great ma|ny Gardens they have &s;everal very good Plants both for U&s;e and Ornament; <HI>Cabbage, Turnip, Carrot, Par&s;nip, Skir|ret</HI> or <HI>Crummocks,</HI> &amp;c. grow to as great a bigne&s;s here as any where; and <HI>Ar|tichokes</HI> to a greater than ever I have &s;een them in any other place.</P>
<P>I do not under&s;tand the rea&s;on why Trees don't grow here, &s;ince in the &s;ame Latitude in <HI>Norway,</HI> and &s;ome de|grees more Northerly, Trees thrive ve|ry well, even on &s;mall Rocks &s;urroun|ded by the Sea. I know not whether it be in places where the Sea makes &s;uch a breach as it does in &s;ome places of this Country, where the Sea-water, with the violence of the Storm, is carry'd a great way on the Land, and bla&s;ts all it falls on: This, with the violent Winds that oft blow in this Country, I think, may be one rea&s;on why Trees don't pro&s;per &s;o well; but if they have the &s;ame Breaches in <HI>Norway,</HI> I don't know what to &s;ay to it. Whether Trees have grown here of old; or, what is more probable, if it be the remains yet of the Flood, but commonly, in their Mo&s;|&s;es,
<PB N="36" REF="27">
they find Trees of twenty or thirty Foot long.</P>
<P>After Storms of We&s;terly Wind, a|mong&s;t the Sea-weed, they find com|monly in places expos'd to the We&s;tern-Ocean the&s;e <HI>Pha&s;eoli,</HI> that, I know not for what rea&s;on, go under the Name of <HI>Molucca</HI> Beans. The in|genious <HI>Doctor Sloan</HI> in the <HI>Philo&s;ophi|cal Tran&s;actions,</HI> Number 222, gives a very &s;atisfactory Account, how from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where they commonly grow, they may be thrown in on <HI>Ire|land,</HI> the We&s;tern parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Orkney.</HI> You have the Figures of four different &s;orts of them.</P>
<P>Here is good &s;tore of Sheep and Cows, which tho' they be little, yet yield abundance of Milk. Their Ewes are &s;o fertile, that mo&s;t of them have two at a Birth, &s;ome three. I my &s;elf &s;aw one that had four all living and following the Dam.</P>
<P>Their Hor&s;es are but little, yet &s;trong, and can endure a great deal of Fatigue, mo&s;t of which they have from <HI>Zet|land</HI> and are call'd <HI>Shelties.</HI> There are great Herds of Swine and rich War|rens almo&s;t in every I&s;le, well &s;tor'd
<PB N="37" REF="27">
with Rabbits. Frogs are &s;een but &s;el|dom, yet there are &s;ome Toads, tho', as it is thought, they are not poi&s;onous, as indeed there are few, if any, poi&s;o|nous Animals in all this Country.</P>
<P>Many <HI>Ottars</HI> and <HI>Seols</HI> are to be had every where, and oft times <HI>Spout Whales</HI> and <HI>Pellacks</HI> run in great number up|on the &s;hore and are taken, as in the Year 1691, near <HI>Kair&s;ton</HI> in the <HI>Main|land,</HI> there run in a Bay no le&s;s than a hundred and fourteen at once.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stellae-marinae</HI> and <HI>Urtica-Marina</HI> are oft thrown in great plenty. In the Sea they catch Ling, Keeling, Haddock, Whiting, Mackrel, Turbat, Scate, Con|gre-Eels, Sole, Fleuks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ome|times they catch Sturgeon.</P>
<P>In the Year 1682, in Winter, there was taken a &s;trange but beautifull Fi&s;h in <HI>Sanda</HI> (where &s;everal of them had been taken before) it was about an Ell in length, deep Brea&s;ted, and narrow at the Tail; the Head and Finns, and a &s;troke down the Back were all of a deep &s;carlet colour, which made it beau|tiful to look on; the re&s;t was of a brown|i&s;h colour, without &s;cales, having &s;e|veral whiti&s;h &s;pots in the Body; the
<PB N="38" REF="28">
Fi&s;h of the half next the Head was like Beef, and of the other half next the Tail was like Salmon.</P>
<P>Herring &s;wim thorough the&s;e I&s;lands in great plenty, but the People are not &s;o frugal, or have not the way, to catch them. Some Years ago, many Ships from <HI>Fife</HI> frequented this Country for the catching of Herrings; but the Sea|men having been in the Year 1645, at the Battle of <HI>Kil&s;yth,</HI> they were there almo&s;t all Killed; &s;ince which time that Trade failed; tho' the Hollanders, to our eternal Reproach, fail not to keep it up to their great advantage.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;trange Fi&s;hes are ca&s;t a &s;hore, to which the People give as &s;trange Names. I &s;ee one like a Goo&s;e Feather, the Body being like the Quill, and the Tail like the Feather, of a red|di&s;h colour. This &s;eems to be what <HI>Ge&s;ner</HI> calls, <HI>Penna Marina Sitardi.</HI> As for that &s;trange &s;leeping Fi&s;h that <HI>Boe|thius</HI> mentions in his De&s;cription of this Country, I could never hear of it.</P>
<P>I have oft ob&s;erv'd in the Head of the grayi&s;h Snail, tho&s;e bright white Stones <HI>Doctor Li&s;ter</HI> mentions in his excellent Book, <HI>De Cochleis &amp; Araneis Angliae,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="28">
The People here beat them to Powder, and reckon it a Specifick for the Gra|vel.</P>
<P>As to their Land Shells, I cannot &s;o well de&s;cribe, &s;ince, after I under&s;tood any thing of that part of Natural Hi|&s;tory, the very &s;hort time I &s;taid there gave me but little opportunity to make &s;o nice an enquiry as I &s;hould other|wi&s;e have done; only I ob&s;erv'd a great variety of the <HI>Cochleae Terre&s;tres,</HI> both as to their <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;ciae,</HI> and that <HI>buccinum rupium,</HI> &amp;c. which Dr. <HI>Lister</HI> de&s;cribes <HI>Tit.</HI> 8. <HI>De Cochleis Terrestribus.</HI> Since there are no Rivers, there can no River-&s;hells be expected here; but in their &s;mall Rivolets the <HI>buccinum exi|guum trium &s;pirarum &agrave; &s;ini&s;tra in dextram convolutarum</HI> was common: And of the Sea-&s;hells I found the</P>

<P>THere is in <HI>Hoy,</HI> lying betwixt two Hills, a Stone, call'd the <HI>Dwarfie-Stone,</HI> which is one entire Stone, thirty &s;ix Foot long, eighteen Foot broad, nine Foot thick; hallow'd within by the Hand of &s;ome Ma&s;on (for the prints of the Irons are to be &s;een on it to this day) with a &s;quare hole of about two Foot high for the entry, and a Stone proportionable &s;tanding before it for a Door. Within, at one end, is a Bed ex|cellently cut out of the Stone, with a Pillow, wherein two Men may lie to|gether at their full length; at the other
<PB N="52" REF="35">
end is a Couch, and in the middle a Hearth for a Fire, with a round hole cut out above for the Chimney. It &s;tands in a de&s;olate melancholy place, more than a Mile from any inhabited Hou&s;e, and all the Ground about it no|thing but high Heath and Heather. It's thought to have been the re&s;idence of &s;ome melancholy Hermit. See the Fi|gure of it.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of this Stone &s;tands on exceeding high Mountain, of a &s;teep a&s;cent, call'd the <HI>Wart Hill</HI> of <HI>Hoy;</HI> near the top of which, in the Month of <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> about Mid|day, is &s;een &s;omething that &s;hines and &s;parkles admirably, and which is often &s;een a great way off. It hath &s;hined more brightly before than it does now, tho' many have climbed up the Hill, and attempted to &s;earch for it, yet they could find nothing. The Vulgar talk of it as &s;ome enchanted Carbuncle; but I take it rather to be &s;ome Water &s;liding down the face of a &s;mooth Rock, which when the Sun at &s;uch a time &s;hines upon, the reflection cau&s;eth that admirable &s;plendor.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="35">
At <HI>Stennis,</HI> in the <HI>Mainland,</HI> where the Loch is narrowe&s;t, in the middle, having a Cau&s;ey of Stones over it for a Bridge, there is, at the South-end of the Bridge, a Round &s;et about with high &s;mooth Stones or Flags, about twenty Foot high above ground, &s;ix Foot broad, and each a Foot or two thick. Betwixt that Round and the Bridge are two Stones &s;tanding of that &s;ame largene&s;s with the re&s;t, whereof one hath a round hole in the mid&s;t of it; and at the o|ther end of the Bridge, about half a Mile removed from it, is a large Round about an hundred and ten paces in Dia|meter, &s;et about with &s;uch Stones as the former, but that &s;ome of them are fall'n down; and at both Ea&s;t and We&s;t of this bigger Round, are two artificial (as is thought) green Mounts; both the&s;e Rounds are ditched about. See the Figure of it.</P>
<P>Some think that the&s;e Rounds have been places whereon two oppo&s;ite Ar|mies have encamped; but I think it more probable that they have been the high places in the <HI>Pagan</HI> times, where|on Sacrifice was offered, and that the&s;e two Mounts were the places where the
<PB N="54" REF="36">
A&s;hes of the Sacrifice was flung. And this is the more probable, becau&s;e <HI>Boe|thius,</HI> in the Life of <HI>Mainus,</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> makes mention of that kind of high Stones, calling them the Temples of the Gods. His words are the&s;e. <Q>In Memory of what King <HI>Mainus</HI> ordai|ned anent the wor&s;hip of the Gods, there remains yet, in our days, many huge Stones drawn together in form of a Circle, named by the People the Ancient Temples of the Gods; and it is no &s;mall admiration to con&s;ider by what Art or Strength &s;o many huge Stones have been brought together.</Q> So far <HI>Boethius.</HI></P>
<P>There are be&s;ides in many other pla|ces of this Country, <HI>Obelisks,</HI> or great high Stones, &s;et in the Ground like the former, and &s;tanding apart (and indeed they are &s;o very large that none &s;ees them, but wonders by what Engine they have been erected) which are thought to be &s;et up either as a memo|rial of &s;ome famous Battle, or as a mo|nument of &s;ome remarkable Per&s;on that has been buried there; that way of ho|nouring de&s;erving and valiant Men, be|ing
<PB N="55" REF="36">
the invention of King <HI>Rentha,</HI> as <HI>Boe|thius</HI> &s;ays.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Rou&s;ay,</HI> betwixt high Mountains, a place, call'd the Camp of <HI>Jupiter Fring.</HI> The name is &s;trange and would import &s;ome notable acci|dent; but what it was I could not learn.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of the <HI>Mainland,</HI> near <HI>Skeal,</HI> on the top of high Rocks, more than a quarter of a Mile in length, there is &s;omething like a Street all &s;et in red Clay, with a &s;ort of reddi&s;h Stones of &s;everal figures and magni|tudes; having the Images and Repre|&s;entations of &s;everal things, as it were, engraven on them; and, which is very &s;trange, a great many of the&s;e Stones, when they are rai&s;ed up, have that &s;ame Image engraven under, which they have above. This Cau&s;ey is all a|long the tops of Rocks, and though they be otherwi&s;e of a very con&s;ide|rable heighth above the Sea, yet the We&s;t Ocean in a Storm leading that way, does da&s;hwith &s;uch violence again&s;t the Rocks, that the Sea breaches do wa&s;h the Ground on the tops of the Rocks. If the&s;e Stones had not the &s;ame Figure on that &s;ide next the ground
<PB N="56" REF="37">
that they have above, I &s;hould think the Sea wa&s;hing over them might occa&s;ion the&s;e different figures, by wa&s;hing a|way the &s;ofti&s;h parts of the Stone and leaving the harder, and &s;o accordingly give them the&s;e accidental Shapes and Figures. Tho' there are a great many of them &s;till remaining, yet the Gen|tlemen living near that place have ta|ken away tho&s;e that had the prettie&s;t Figures to &s;et their Chimnies with, as they u&s;e to do in <HI>Holland</HI> with painted Bricks and Tiles.</P>
<P>In the Links of <HI>Skeal,</HI> where the Sand is blown away with the Wind, are found &s;everal places built &s;quare, with Stones well cemented together, and a Stone lying in the mouth, having &s;ome black Earth in them. The like of which al&s;o are found in the Links of <HI>Rou&s;um</HI> in <HI>Stron&s;a;</HI> where al&s;o, &s;ome Years ago, was &s;ound another remarkable Monu|ment. It was a whole round Stone like a Barrel, hollow within, &s;harp edged at the top, having the bottom joyn'd like the bottom of a Barrel; on the mouth was a round Stone conform to the mouth of the Monument, and a|bove that a large Stone for the pre&s;er|vation
<PB N="57" REF="37">
of the whole; within was nothing but red Clay and burn'd Bones. See the Fi|gure. It's like that this and the other Four-&s;quare Monuments have been &s;ome of the&s;e Urns wherein the Romans, when they were in this Country, laid up the A&s;hes of their dead. Likewi&s;e in the Links of <HI>Tranabie,</HI> in <HI>We&s;tra,</HI> have been found Graves in the Sand, in one of which was &s;een a Man lying with his Sword on the one Hand, and a Dani&s;h Axe on the other; and others that have had Dogs, and Combs and Knives bu|ry'd with them, which &s;eems to &s;hew the way how the <HI>Danes,</HI> when they were in this Country, bury'd their dead, as the other was of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Be|&s;ides in many places of the Country are found little Hillocks, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Sepulchres</HI> of the ancient <HI>Pights.</HI> For <HI>Tacitus</HI> tells that it was the way of the ancient <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;tegan</HI> that it was the way of the ancient <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Sax|ons,</HI> to lay dead Bodies on the ground, and cover them over with tur&s;s and clods of earth, in the fa&s;hion of little Hillocks: hence it &s;eems that the many Hou&s;es and Villages in this Country,
<PB N="58" REF="38">
which are call'd by the name of <HI>Brogh,</HI> and which all of them are built up|on, or be&s;ide &s;ome &s;uch ri&s;ing ground, have been cemeteries for the burying of the dead in the time of the <HI>Pights</HI> and <HI>Saxons:</HI> For the word <HI>Brogh</HI> in the Teutonick Language, &s;ignifies a burying place.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e hillocks near the circle of high Stones, at the North end of the Bridge of <HI>Stennis,</HI> there were found nine <HI>Fibulae</HI> of Silver of the &s;hape of a Hor&s;e-&s;hooe, but round. See the Figure of one of them.</P>
<P>Moreover in many places of this Country, are to be &s;een the ruins and ve&s;tiges of great but antique Buildings; mo&s;t of them now covered over with Earth, and call'd in this Country <HI>Pights</HI> Hou&s;es, &s;ome of which its like have been the Forts and Re&s;idences of the <HI>Pights</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> when they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd this Country.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t there is one in the I&s;le of <HI>Wyre,</HI> called the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cubbe|row,</HI> or rather <HI>Coppi-row,</HI> which in the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Language, &s;ignifies a Tower of Security from outward violence. It is Trenched about, of it nothing now

remains but the fir&s;t Floor. It is a perfect Square, the Wall eight foot thick, &s;trongly built and cemented with Lime, the breadth or length within Walls not being above ten foot, having a large Door and a &s;lit for the Window. Of this <HI>Cubbirow</HI> the Common people report many Idle Fables, not fit to be in&s;erted here.</P>
<P>In the Pari&s;h of <HI>Hara</HI> in the <HI>Main|land,</HI> in a Marle-pit as they were dig|ging Marle for mannor to their ground, there was found in the Marle a large piece of a Harts horn, as I was credi|bly inform'd by a Gentleman who got the Horn from the&s;e men, and had it then by him.</P>
<P>In the Pari&s;h of <HI>Evie</HI> near the Sea are &s;ome &s;mall hillocks, which frequent|ly in the night time appear all in a Fire, and the Church of <HI>Evie</HI> called St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> is oft &s;een full of Light, as if Torches or Candles were burn|ing in it all night. This amazes the people greatly, but po&s;&s;ibly it's no|thing el&s;e but &s;ome thick glutinous Meteor, that receives that Light in the night time.</P>

At the <HI>Noup-head</HI> in <HI>We&s;tra</HI> is a Rock &s;urrounded with the Sea, call'd <HI>Le&s;s,</HI> which the inhabitants of that I&s;le &s;ay, has this &s;trange property; that if a Man go upon it, having any Iron upon him, the Sea will in&s;tantly &s;well in &s;uch a Tempe&s;tuous way, that no Boat can come near to take him off, and the Sea will not be calm'd till the Iron be thrown away: I being there to make an experiment of it, of|fer'd Money to a poor fellow, to go upon the Rock, with a piece of Iron, but he would not do it on any terms.</P>
<P>Sometimes about this Country, are &s;een the&s;e men they call <HI>Finn-men.</HI> In the year 1682, one was &s;een in his little Boat, at the South end of the I&s;le of <HI>Eda,</HI> mo&s;t of the people of the I&s;le flock'd to &s;ee him, and when they adventur'd to put out a Boat with Men to &s;ee if they could apprehend him, he pre&s;ently fled away mo&s;t &s;wiftly. And in the year 1684, another was &s;een from <HI>We&s;tra;</HI> I mu&s;t acknowledge it &s;eems a little unaccountable, how the&s;e Finn-men &s;hould come on this coa&s;t, but they mu&s;t probably be driven by Storms from home, and cannot tell when they

are any way at Sea, how to make their way home again; they have this ad|vantage, that be the Seas never &s;o boi|&s;terous their Boat being made of Fi&s;h Skins, are &s;o contrived that he can ne|ver &s;ink, but is like a Sea-gull &s;wimming on the top of the Water.

<P>THE People here are generally civil, &s;agacious, circum&s;pect and piou&s;ly inclined; Though <HI>Boethius</HI> re|ports them to be great Drunkards and <HI>Maginus</HI> &s;ays of them, <HI>quod &s;unt bibaci&s;|&s;imi, nunquam tamen inebriantur,</HI> yet now it is not &s;o; for though they u&s;e &s;trong Ale and Beer (the nature of the Country requiring &s;trong Liquor) yet generally they are Sober and Temperate, but withal much given to Ho&s;pitality

and Fea&s;ting, very civil and liberal in their entertaining of Strangers, and much inclined to &s;peak ill of tho&s;e that are peevi&s;hly or niggardly di&s;pos'd.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> tells a Story, which is &s;till believ'd here and talk'd of as a truth, though now there be nothing of it. That at <HI>Scapa</HI> a place about a mile of <HI>Kirkwal</HI> to the South, there was kept a large cup, and when any new Bi&s;hop landed there, they filled it with &s;trong Ale, and offer'd it to him to drink, and if he happened to drink it of chearfully, they promi&s;ed to them&s;elves a Noble Bi&s;hop, and many good years in his time.</P>
<P>In many places the Landlord has his Tenant bound to give him and his followers, a liberal Entertainment once a year, e&s;pecially at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> (at which time the People of this Country are generally inclin'd to Fea&s;ting) and the Tenant wont fail to have good Victu|als and &s;trong Ale (which they call Bummock) in readine&s;s, and will be much offended if the Landlord refu&s;e to make merry with them.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="41">
The People are generally per&s;ona|ble, and comely, <HI>Polyd.

<P>We under &s;ub&s;cribers te&s;tify and de|clare that <HI>Marjory Bimbi&s;ter</HI> in the Pa|ri&s;h of <HI>Evie</HI> in <HI>Orkney,</HI> was in <HI>Septem|ber</HI> 1683. untimeou&s;ly delivered of a Male child; though we have al&s;o &s;ure account of her age in our Regi&s;ter of Bapti&s;m, yet many of the Pari&s;h who are of &s;ixty four years, and who&s;e age is certainly known, report that to their knowledge &s;he is as old as they: be|&s;ides her &s;elf remembers, that in the year 1631, (which was a year of Fa|mine in this Country, and from which the common People u&s;ually reckon) &s;he was keeping Cattle, being then a

<P>By rea&s;on of the temperance of their Dyet and whol&s;omne&s;s of the Air, the People u&s;ually live to a great Age. A Man in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Ham</HI> dyed not many Years &s;ince, who liv'd upwards of Four&s;core Years with one Wife, in a marry'd e&s;tate. There is al&s;o a Gentle|man, yet living in <HI>Stron&s;a,</HI> who was Begotten of his Father when he was an hundred Years old, and did live till he &s;aw this &s;ame Man's Children.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="42">
Some there be al&s;o of an exceeding high Stature, as that young Man, who, for his height, was u&s;ually call'd, <HI>The Mickle Man of Waes,</HI> as being a great deal higher than the common &s;ort of Men. At the Chaple of <HI>Clet,</HI> in <HI>Sanda,</HI> is a Grave to be &s;een, wherein, they &s;ay, a Giant was bury'd; and indeed the Stone that is laid upon the Grave is a|bout twelve Foot long; &s;o that, if the Body has been proportionable to the Grave, it has been exceeding Mon|&s;trous.</P>
<P>The more common and general Di&s;ea|&s;es here are the Scurvy, Agues, Con|&s;umptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Commonly in the Spring they are troubled with an Agui&s;h Di|&s;temper which they call the <HI>Axes,</HI> but for this there are <HI>Quacks</HI> among&s;t them that pretend an infallible Cure, by way of Diet-drink, infu&s;ing a Hotch-potch of &s;everal Plants (I &s;uppo&s;e what are greene&s;t at that time) in an Engli&s;h Gal|lon of Ale; the Receipt is this, They take of <HI>Buckhorn, Plantain, Water Plantain, Lov|age, wild Dai&s;ie, Rocket, Roots of Elecampane, Millefoil, Roots of Spignell, Dandelyon, Par|&s;ley Roots, Wormwood, Cumfrey, Tan&s;ey, Thrift</HI> or <HI>Sea-Pink; Garden Angelica,</HI> and
<PB N="67" REF="42">
a kind of <HI>Ma&s;terwort,</HI> the <HI>Imperatoriae a&s;&s;inis;</HI> of all the&s;e they take a like quan|tity, to wit, about half a handful, and of this Infu&s;ion they drink half a Pint Morning and Evening. This is what they call the <HI>Axes Gra&s;s,</HI> and the old Women talk wonders of it, pretending there are &s;o many of the Herbs good for the Liver, &s;o many good for the Head, and &s;o many for the Heart, Spleen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In Phthi&s;ical Di&s;tempers they u&s;e <HI>Arby,</HI> the <HI>Caryophyllus Marinus, Thrift</HI> or much as they call it, boyl'd with &s;weet Milk.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of a Cupping-gla&s;s they have a Horn with a &s;mall thin Skin at the &s;maller end. The way how they u&s;e it is thus: The Surgeon with the point of his Knife gives three or four &s;mall cuts or ga&s;hes on the place where he purpo|&s;es to &s;et the Horn; and having &s;et the broade&s;t end on the Wounds, he &s;ucks the &s;mall end a little, and then lets it &s;tand till the abundance of Blood it draws makes it fall off. Some have a way, as they pretend (if they be to Cure any akeing or inward Pain) to draw out &s;everal little Worms out of the
<PB N="68" REF="43">
part affected, whereby they remove the Pain. Others there be that u&s;e Charms for the curing of the Rickets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the&s;e are much curbed by their Mini|&s;ters.</P>
<P>All &s;peak Engli&s;h, after the Scots way, with as good an Accent as any County in the Kingdom, only &s;ome of the common People, among&s;t them&s;elves, &s;peak a Language they call <HI>Norns;</HI> which they have derived to them, ei|ther from the <HI>Pights,</HI> or &s;ome others, who fir&s;t planted this Country; for by the following Lord's Prayer, in that Language, it has but little of the <HI>Da|ni&s;h</HI> or <HI>Norwegian</HI> Language, to which I thought it &s;hould have had more affi|nity, con&s;idering how long time they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this Country.</P>

<P>Since <HI>Ge&s;ner,</HI> in his <HI>Mithridates,</HI> nor Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> in his <HI>Real Character,</HI> have nothing like this, I thought this Formula might not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>Anciently, as they are yet in great mea&s;ure, they were much given to Su|per&s;tition, as appears by the many Cha|pels that are here and there di&s;per&s;ed through the Country; but the Chapels to which mo&s;t frequently they made their Pilgrimage, were to the Chapels of the <HI>Brough</HI> of <HI>Bir&s;a,</HI> and to the Cha|pel of the <HI>Brough</HI> at the <HI>Mulehead</HI> in <HI>Deirne&s;s;</HI> the&s;e two Chapels &s;tanding at the furthe&s;t extremities of the <HI>Mainland</HI> Ea&s;t and We&s;t; nor to this day are the&s;e Pilgrimages omitted by the common People, who &s;till, for the obtaining of &s;ome good, or deprecating of &s;ome evil, do frequent &s;ome Chapels they have mo&s;t veneration for. Be&s;ides, they have this general cu&s;tome; The day that is
<PB N="70" REF="44">
dedicated to the Memory of the Saint who is Patron of the chief Church, where Sermon is made, is kept Holy by the common People of the whole Pa|ri&s;h; &s;o that they will not Work on that day: And tho&s;e that live next the &s;maller Chapels do moreover keep holy that Day, that is dedicated to the Me|mory of that Saint, that Chapel is de|nominated by.</P>
<P>Here they make no u&s;e of Poaks or Sacks, but a &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;el made of Straw, which they call <HI>Ca&s;&s;ies,</HI> in which they keep and tran&s;port their Corn: Nor do they make u&s;e of Peck and Firlot, or any other Mea&s;ure, for their Grain, as they u&s;e to do thorough the re&s;t of the Kingdom, but weigh all, which they have a particular way of doing with Bi&s;mires for &s;mall Weights; and Pound|lers, as they call them, for great Weights. In mo&s;t it re&s;embles a Stilliard that Mo|ney is weighed on. It is a Beam of Timber marked with different weights, which hath a Stone at one end (which Stone on the Malt Poundler &s;hould be a &s;etten weight, and on the Bear Pound|ler &s;ixteen Merk) and a Hook at the o|ther end for hanging up the Ca&s;&s;ie in
<PB N="71" REF="44">
which the Corn or Meal is, and there is a Ring in the middle near the Sheir that has a Pole thru&s;t thorough it, by which, by the help of a Man at each end all is &s;upported, that the Ca&s;&s;ie may &s;wim fair. The lea&s;t weight is call'd a Merk, which will be eighteen Ounces, twenty four Merks make a Lec&s;pound or Setten, &s;ix Settens make a Meil (e|quivalent to a Boll) and eighteen Meils make a Chaldron.</P>
<P>In every I&s;le they have a Wart-hill, or Ward-hill, which is the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous and elevated part of the I&s;le, on which, in time of War, they keep Ward; and when they &s;ee the Enemies Ships approaching, they put a Fire, thereby to give notice to the adjacent I&s;les of the nearne&s;s of the Enemy, and to adverti&s;e them to be on their Guard, or to come to their help; this they di&s;tin|gui&s;h by the number of Fires.</P>
<P>Their Corn Land is every where Par|ked, and without the&s;e inclo&s;ures their Sheep and Swine, and &s;ome of their Cat|tle go at random, without a Herd&s;man to keep them. The mo&s;t ordinary Man|nour they have for their Land, e&s;peci|ally in places near the Sea, is, Sea|weed,
<PB N="72" REF="45">
Sea-ware, as they call it; and in Bayes, after Storms, when the Wrack is driven in greater plenty, all the Peo|ple of the Neighbourhood come and divide the Wrack according to the pro|portion of Land they have about that place; but methinks 'tis the greate&s;t &s;lavery in the World, for the common People, as they do there in Winter, to carry this Wrack in &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els made of Straw or Ca&s;&s;ies on their Backs to their Land.</P>
<P>All their Sheep are marked on the Ears or No&s;e, every man that hath Sheep hath his own Mark, whereby his Sheep are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from others: And 'tis &s;trange to con&s;ider how &s;o ma|different Marks could be invented, as are found cut in &s;o little room. They u&s;e to Fleece their Sheep about the be|ginning of <HI>May,</HI> and the way they take to apprehend them (for they go wild) is both &s;trange and plea&s;ant. The Bai|liff of the Pari&s;h, with the <HI>Law-right-men</HI> which are the Bailiffs A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and the per&s;ons to whom the Sheep belong meet together on a day appointed, ha|ving with them Sheep Dogs, trained up for the Hunting of them, and when
<PB N="73" REF="45">
they would have &s;uch a Sheep caught, they point him out by the finger to the Dog, upon which he runs and &s;in|gles out that Sheep from all the re&s;t, and never leaves of running till he catch him, which being fleec'd or &s;horn by the owner, they then go on and hunt for others.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a plea&s;ant way of ta|king the Sea Fowls when they are young as <HI>Foi&s;ts, Lyers, Kittiwaeks, Gulls</HI> &amp;c. which build very thick on &s;helves of high Rocks; under the Rock there is a Boat with men having a large Net, which at the two uppermo&s;t corners is fa&s;tned with two long Ropes, which are in the hands of men at the top of the Rock, who hoi&s;e up the Net till it be over again&s;t the place where the young Fowl &s;it, then they that are in the Boat under the Rock, have a Rattle which makes &s;o frighting a noi&s;e, that all the young Fowls take wing and fly for|ward into the bo&s;om of the Net where they are caught: Then the Net is laid down in the Boat and the Prey &s;ei&s;ed upon, and thus they go from Rock to Rock taking as many as they can.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="46">
Others have this way in taking the&s;e Fowls, a Man that is accu&s;tomed to the exerci&s;e has a Rope well bound about his middle, with which he is let &s;lide down the &s;teep Rock, till he be over a|gain&s;t the place where the young Fowls are, of whom he apprehends as many as he is able to carry and then is hoi&s;ted up with his Prey. They u&s;e that way al&s;o in taking the young Hawks. There are &s;ome Fellows &s;o hardy that go a catching of Sea Fowls without any help, by tying a Rope about his own mid|dle, and tying the other end to a Stake, which he drives well in the Ground, and &s;o lets him&s;elf go over the Rock (perhaps &s;ome hundred of fathoms) and catches what Fowls he can and then hoi&s;es him&s;elf up again.</P>
<P>Several remarkable accidents have fall'n out in this Country, be&s;ides &s;ome already mentioned. I &s;hall in&s;tance in three or four only, whereof the witne&s;&s;|es are &s;till alive. About the year 1634, when Bi&s;hop <HI>Grahame</HI> was Bi&s;hop of this Country, a young Boy named <HI>William Garioch,</HI> his Father being dead, had &s;ome little Land, and &s;ome &s;mall portion of Cattle, left him by his Fa|ther
<PB N="75" REF="46">
in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Ham;</HI> his Uncle took him in his Service, and having a greedy de&s;ire after the Young mans Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, it happen'd that he &s;tole a Setten of Barley (which will be about Twenty Eight pound weight) from his Uncle: For which he pur&s;ued him be|fore the Sheriff of the Bi&s;hoprick, and the Young man, at that time about Eighteen years of Age, the Theft be|ing proved was Sentenced to be hanged. When he was at the Gallows he prayed that God would inflict &s;ome vi&s;ible Judgment on his Uncle, who becau&s;e of the greedy de&s;ire he had to his little Portion, had for &s;o &s;mall a matter procur'd his Death. It came to pa&s;s that his Uncle walking thorough the Church-Yard of <HI>Kirkwal,</HI> upon the Young mans Grave, the Bi&s;hops Dog &s;ei&s;ed on him and tore out his Throat, whereby he became a &s;ad monument of God's wrath, again&s;t &s;uch impious greedy wretches.</P>
<P>Some years ago, one <HI>James Lenay</HI> and &s;ome others, Fi&s;hing in a Boat be|&s;ide <HI>Au&s;kerie,</HI> in a fair day it came to pa&s;s, that their leaning all on one &s;ide of the Boat, that it overturned and all
<PB N="76" REF="47">
were drowned, except the &s;aid <HI>Lenay,</HI> who by providence got up, and &s;at on the Keil of the Boat, in which conditi|on he continued for the &s;pace of four days, driven by the Tides, &s;ometime this way, and &s;ometime that, &s;ometimes to <HI>We&s;tra,</HI> and back again to <HI>Stron&s;a,</HI> till at la&s;t he was &s;een floating by <HI>Spur|ne&s;s</HI> in <HI>Sanda,</HI> where by the careful en|deavour of the Gentleman who was owner of the Ground he was deliver|ed.</P>
<P>There was one <HI>John Smith</HI> who lived in <HI>Stron&s;a,</HI> who, with three others u&s;ed to fi&s;h not far from Land; their way was to ri&s;e early and &s;tay many Hours a Fi&s;hing. This Man having, by &s;everal days Fi&s;hing, gotten a great plenty of Fi&s;h, his Wife was de&s;irous that he would omit that exerci&s;e for a time, and &s;tay at home to take his re&s;t. He was very unwilling to do &s;o, where|fore next Morning &s;he ri&s;es before him, and being de&s;irous he might take a longer Sleep, after &s;o many days toil, &s;he &s;top|ped the holes and windows of the Room where he lay that he might &s;leep the more &s;oundly, and then &s;he went to the Fields to her work, where, working
<PB N="77" REF="47">
with her Servants &s;he was &s;urpris'd with this &s;ad accident. The three men that u&s;ed to fi&s;h with her Husband, be|cau&s;e he came not, had taken the Boat them&s;elves and gone a Fi&s;hing, and &s;ud|denly the Boat overturned (no man knows how) and the men were all drowned. This the Woman and her Servants &s;eeing &s;tartled them greatly, but tho' &s;he was grieved for their death, yet &s;he was glad that her Husband (by her Policy) went not to Sea with them, and thereupon runs ha&s;tily to the hou&s;e to acquaint her Husband with that &s;ad accident, and to congratulate with him for his pre&s;ervation: when opening the door &s;he was &s;urpris'd with a more &s;ad and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ight, even the Death of her own husband: For he having ri&s;en out of his bed, had fallen with his head in a large ve&s;&s;el wherein they u&s;ed to make Urine, where he was choked and found dead.</P>
<P>Strange are the effects that are here &s;ometimes produc'd by Thunder and Lightning, for by it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1670 the Steeple of the Cathedral Church at <HI>Kirkwal</HI> was burned, and &s;ometimes it will &s;eize on low Cottages. In the
<PB N="78" REF="48">
year 1680 the Lightning enter'd a Gen|tlemans Cow-&s;tall, where were twelve Cows &s;tanding &s;ide for &s;ide, as they u&s;ed to be, and killed every other one, that is, it killed the fir&s;t, and mi&s;&s;ed the &s;econd; it killed the third, and mi&s;&s;ed the fourth, and &s;o of the re&s;t; &s;o that &s;ix were killed and &s;ix remained alive and untouched.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of the Town of</HI> Kirkwall.</HEAD>
<P>THE only remarkable Town in all this Country is <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> an ancient Burrough long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> by whom it was called <HI>Cracoviaca,</HI> built upon a plea&s;ant Oy&s;e or Inlet of the Sea, near the middle of the <HI>Mainland;</HI> narrow &s;treeted, and about a mile in length, having a very &s;afe Harbour and road for Ships.

Almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es in this Town are Slaited, but the mo&s;t remarkable Edi|fices
<PB N="79" REF="48">
in it are the Cathedral Church and the Bi&s;hops Palace. As for the Kings Ca|&s;tle it is new demoli&s;hed, but by the Ruins it appears to have been a &s;trong and &s;tately Fort, and probably built by &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Orkney,</HI> as would appear from a remarkable Stone &s;et in the mid&s;t of the Wall, which looks towards the &s;treet, with a Bi&s;hops Mi|ter and Arms engraven'd on it. There is here a publick School for the Teach|ing of Grammar, endowed with a com|petent Salary, and at the North end of the Town is a place built by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s time, Ditched about, with a Brea&s;t-work, and &s;ome other Fortifications, on which they have &s;ome Cannon planted for the defence of the Harbour.</P>
<P>This Town had been erected into a Royal Burrough in the time of the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> and <HI>Anno</HI> 1486, King <HI>James</HI> the Third gave them a Charter, con|firming their old Erection and Privi|leges; &s;pecifying their antiquity, and giving them power to hold Burrough Courts, to incarcerate and arre&s;t, to make Laws and Ordinances, and to elect their own Magi&s;trates yearly for
