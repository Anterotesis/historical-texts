<P>_THIS attempt of <HI>Spinola's</HI> vpon <HI>Bergen,</HI> makes me re|member that famous Siege in 1590. or thereabouts, when the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> came before it with 30000. and continued the battery almo&s;t halfe a yeare.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e I would reuiue the memory of famous men to the good example of others, and relate &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages worthy the ob&s;eruation to the renowne of vertuous and worthy exploites,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
giue me leaue by way of introduction to &s;peake &s;omething of tho&s;e times, and &s;o by coherence of Story you &s;hall &s;ee me fall into the matter now propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> in the behalfe of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> being then his ab&s;olute Gouernour in the Low Countries, after that e|uer memorable Victory in 88. to lay &s;iege vnto <HI>Bergen</HI> with aboue 30000. men, as if hee re&s;olued to doe &s;ome thing worthy of his Honour, and memorable to po&s;terity, as it were in recouery of tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es and fortunes, which both hapned to him and his Ma&s;ter at that time: but &s;o many Skirmi&s;hes, Stratagems, and encounters were then put in practice, that hee was compelled to ri&s;e and leaue the Siege, till better opportuni|ty and fairer dayes.</P>
<P>I will not &s;peake a worde of neither Armies, nor their skirmi&s;hes, nor their A&s;&s;aults, nor their Batteries, nor their Sallies, nor their &s;tratagems, nor of <HI>Grim&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Redhead,</HI> by who&s;e pollicy and &s;eruice, 400. of <HI>Parma's</HI> be&s;t Gentlemen lo&s;t their liues: but of the brauery of the be&s;ieged and the glory of the Engli&s;h, who&s;e fame flori|&s;hed ouer the world.</P>
<P>For in this &s;iege, that Sonne of <HI>Mars</HI> the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> was Generall of the Engli&s;h, and &s;uch a Generall, that his authority extended in be|&s;towing of honour vpon well de&s;eruers, which appeared in Knighting tho&s;e famous Dutchmen
<PB N="3" REF="3">
Sir <HI>Paul Buxe,</HI> and Sir <HI>Marcellus Buxe,</HI> who after|ward proued Gouernour of <HI>Bergen,</HI> and &s;o con|tinued many yeares.</P>
<P>But at this in&s;tant Sir <HI>Thomas Morgan</HI> a Colo|nell was Gouernour of the place, and had 6000. braue defendants in the Towne: there were al&s;o famous Commanders all Engli&s;h, the Lord <HI>Bo|rough</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Brill,</HI> a &s;pirit of vnmatchable Valour: Sir <HI>Nicholas Parker</HI> called Captaine of the blacke Lances: Sir <HI>William Drury,</HI> Sir <HI>William Pellam,</HI> and &s;o many other, all Commaunders, that their well de&s;eruing commaunds me to &s;i|lence, lea&s;t I &s;hould by this my &s;lender di&s;cour&s;e extenuate their Noble fame, and merit.</P>
<P>There came likewi&s;e as Voluntiers, and &s;pecta|tors of this Theater of Warre, the Right Hono|rable Earle of Northumberland, Sir <HI>Iohn Bo|roughs</HI> and diuers others: yea heere were faire Ladies too, who were &s;o farre from artificiall ef|feminatenes, that they &s;corned the &s;moake of powder, and knewe (be&s;ides the iu&s;tification of their courages) that true beauty would not, nor could not be impaired with a little du&s;t, and va|pours of a thickned ayre.</P>
<P>All the&s;e endured this Siege, and in &s;teed of Courtly mu&s;icke had the roaring Cannon &s;oun|ding in their eares: in &s;teed of &s;umptuous im|broderings, and be&s;pangled Cloakes with golde and Pearle, or other dainty fights, many times beheld bloody Ca&s;&s;ocks, &amp; wounded Soldiers:
<PB N="4" REF="4">
and all the &s;ences both of men and women were here to &s;uffer vn&s;auery obiects, and &s;ubiects, and to make tryall of their patience and con&s;tancy, which they did with per&s;euerance to the end: yea this is mo&s;t remarkeable, that when the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> made his approaches, as if hee pretended a battery, and &s;o a breach, the heroijck Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> &s;ent him word to &s;pare that la|bour, if he plea&s;ed: For he &s;hould haue a Port o|pen, enter if hee could: whereupon the Prince was much amazed, and &s;o hauing a full halfe, yeares tryall of the bu&s;ines, and &s;till encombred with the dayly &s;allies, and excur&s;ions of the Sol|diers, he thought it farre better to rai&s;e his &s;iege with honour, and vpon equall tearmes, then ad|uenture &s;o many liues, and yet (as he had beene in &s;ome ca&s;es put to it) hazard his renowne with fearefull lo&s;&s;e and detriment.</P>
<P>Let vs therefore ouerlooke their actions to vnder&s;tand, which way this &s;iege comes about, and how time hath brought them into this threatning and danger.</P>
<P>After the taking in of <HI>We&s;ell</HI> and <HI>Gulick</HI> by <HI>Spi|nola,</HI> wherein the fir&s;t they left <HI>Don Lewis de Va|la&s;co</HI> for Gouernour: and in the la&s;t <HI>Henry Vande Bergen,</HI> the Army retired to their &s;euerall Gari|&s;ons, and &s;urely meant to repo&s;e them&s;elues in &s;ome re&s;t and quietnes, had not contrary to cu|&s;tome, and the time of the yeare to draw men in|to the fields. <HI>Don Ynigo,</HI> Gouernour of the Citta|dell
<PB N="5" REF="4">
of <HI>Antwarp,</HI> proiected to doe &s;omething worthy of his renowne, and the &s;eruice of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e the Arch-Dutches, and this was the be&s;ieging of <HI>Sluice:</HI> whereupon hee vndertooke the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in the beginning of Aprill la&s;t, with &s;euen or 8000. Wallons and Spaniards, di&s;pier|&s;ing them &s;ome to <HI>Dy&s;endike:</HI> &s;ome to St. <HI>Kathe|vine,</HI> a Fort builded and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the States, and &s;ome to &s;uch places, where hee thought it mo&s;t conuenient to be&s;tow them, re&s;oluing to enter vpon <HI>Ca&s;&s;ant,</HI> and other pa&s;&s;ages, whereby hee might with ea&s;e come vpon the bankes, and &s;o bring his approches neerer the Towne, which to effect, he built a Fort, and put therein a Ga|ri&s;on to come neerer and neerer, to &s;et his de|&s;igne on her be&s;t feet.</P>
<P>This he fir&s;t attempted, when <HI>Spinolas</HI> Army watched the <HI>Rhine,</HI> &amp; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> ouer|looked his Army by <HI>We&s;ell:</HI> and this hee did of purpo&s;e, as I take it, to diuert his Excellencie from following him any further, &s;uppo&s;ing hee would returne to defend a Towne of &s;uch im|portance, as <HI>Sluice</HI> was: but the States had lei&s;ure and meanes (without troubling the Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> at all) to &s;upply their wants, &amp; &s;end more Companies into the Towne: &s;o that <HI>Spinola</HI> got nothing, but the lo&s;&s;e of men, with cold, hunger, and &s;icknes all the Winter, and &s;o con&s;umed his Army, that he tried many friends and Countries
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to fill vp his troupes and Companies. At la&s;t, the Winter falling out &s;o &s;trange, and <HI>Don Ynigo</HI> perceiuing all accidents to counter-checke his pretences; he tooke another cour&s;e for the time, and returned to <HI>Antwarp,</HI> doing no great matter about <HI>Sluice,</HI> but rai&s;ing a Fort a little neerer, which they &s;ay hee could not effect without the lo&s;&s;e of 800. men.</P>
<P>When my Lords the States vnder&s;toode of this retreat, and that <HI>Ca&s;&s;ant</HI> and other Polders of land round about, were free from this threat|ning perill and di&s;plea&s;ure, they adui&s;ed them|&s;elues for the be&s;t, and by a premeditated &s;etled Councell, re&s;olued not to loo&s;e <HI>Sluice,</HI> nor haue her hedges trodden downe round about her, that is, her Bulwarkes and Trenches demoli|&s;hed, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Strangers: whereupon they concluded to cut all the ditches, and let in the Sea, which they did in the end of February, and in which worke the Contributory Boores were imployed: and although it turned much to their preiudice, as loo&s;ing both land, and dwelling by this cour&s;e: yet when they &s;aw, it was for the &s;eruice of the States, and the pre&s;eruation of the Towne, they quickly accorded, and played the Pyoners in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>They began behinde the Fort of St. <HI>Cateline,</HI> and &s;o di&s;pierced them&s;elues to <HI>Crines,</HI> Saint
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<HI>Margarite,</HI> Saint <HI>Hieronimo,</HI> Saint <HI>Iames,</HI> the <HI>Her|mitage,</HI> and many <HI>Polaers</HI> of land, with the other Forts and Holds round about, but when the tide came in a pace: they made &s;ure <HI>Rowfellares, Hollands dike,</HI> and many Fortifications on the other &s;ide, which might be preiudiciall to the maine bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, &s;o that at la&s;t the Sea &s;welled almo&s;t as farre as <HI>Gaunt,</HI> and the Enemy was glad to &s;ecure them&s;elues by returning, and &s;o the coa&s;t was in a manner cleared at this time: For <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Hautin</HI> the Gouernour of <HI>Sluice,</HI> made a &s;alley with fifteene hundred, among&s;t whom were &s;ufficient Commaunders, and well experienced Trenchers and Engineeres, who performed this worke in &s;uch a manner, that the principall Fortre&s;&s;es, which &s;erued for the defence of <HI>Sluice,</HI> were all &s;ecured and kept vp|right; and although the Sea &s;welled as farre as <HI>Vedo</HI> and <HI>Bu&s;cams Vell,</HI> yet was the land not com|parable to the liues of &s;o many braue Souldi|ers, who mu&s;t needes peri&s;h, if this had not beene done, and the &s;iege of <HI>Sluice</HI> once at|tempted throughly.</P>
<P>When <HI>Spinola</HI> vnder&s;tood, what was done, hee retired in his per&s;on to <HI>Bru&s;sels,</HI> from the clamours of the Army, who began to want their pay, and murmur for lacke of imploy|ment, and &s;atisfaction: whereupon hee gaue the Commaunders leaue to promi&s;e them faire, and threaten once againe the &s;urpri&s;ing of <HI>Sluice,
<PB N="8" REF="6">
Breda,</HI> and <HI>Bergen,</HI> as though they would haue three Armies on foote at once, and meant to make an end of the Warre in one Summer, to which they were the rather animated, becau&s;e they heard of new &s;upplies out of <HI>England,</HI> to fill vp the Regiments of the Earles of <HI>Tyrone</HI> and <HI>Argile,</HI> who were both heere entertained as Co|lonels vnder the Archdutches &s;eruice.</P>
<P>But when this threatning pa&s;&s;ed ouer with|out attempting any thing worthy of moment, the Prince of <HI>Orenges</HI> brother, <HI>Graue Henry,</HI> with fiue thou&s;and foot, and &s;ixe hundred hor&s;e, en|ters into <HI>Brabant,</HI> burning Villages, &s;poyling Townes, and forraging all the Countrey, in &s;o much that the fires were &s;eene at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and the Inhabitants ranne into their walled Townes for their pre&s;eruation: yea, when <HI>Spinola</HI> fea&s;ted the Amba&s;&s;adours, and attended the determination of the truce, was this braue Souldier reading his Subiects a le&s;&s;on of Warre and Slaughter, and tyed them to harder conditions then euer they learned in their liues; by which occa&s;ion hee mightily enriched him&s;elfe, and returned to the <HI>Hage</HI> with great booty, &s;poile, trea&s;ure, and pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>Whereby the Enemy grewe enraged, and thought vpon nothing but reuenge, which at la&s;t they effected vpon the &s;urprizing of <HI>Bergen vp Zome,</HI> wherein failing, they fell into the cour&s;e of
<PB N="9" REF="6">
be&s;ieging it, whereat they remaine at this houre; but becau&s;e many remarkeable thinges chanced in this preparation, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to or|der the Di&s;cour&s;e in this manner.</P>
<P>The Towne of <HI>Bergen</HI> is of as great impor|tance to the States in Brabant, as <HI>Sluice</HI> in Flaun|ders: For as this watcheth <HI>O&s;tend, Newport, Dumkirke,</HI> and other maritine Townes, yea ope|neth a doore to <HI>Ipers, Gaunt</HI> and all the land Countrey, that keepeth the Riuers, and is the Key of the continent letting you in to the fieldes of <HI>Antwerpe, Thurmount, Au&s;chiroten,</HI> and all the great Townes of <HI>Brabant</HI>: It &s;tandeth on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Riuer of <HI>Some,</HI> comming from <HI>Ant|werpe,</HI> &amp; <HI>Antwerpe</HI> is &s;cituated within 15. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile, and was one of the famous Marte Townes of the world: and as this Bergen is the very Gate or entrance into the Countrey, &s;o is it in a manner the barre and hinderance of the Enemy into Zealand and Holland: The States haue likewi&s;e diuers Sconces in the Iland of <HI>Tole</HI> or <HI>Tertoll</HI> of great re&s;pect and nece&s;&s;ity, and with|in Fiue mile of Bergen, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e a Towne called <HI>Steen Bergen,</HI> on the We&s;t banke of ano|ther Riuer comming out of the Countrey, at the mouth whereof, they haue another Sconce and other Fortes.</P>
<P>I will not &s;peake of <HI>Breda,</HI> and &s;ome places in
<PB N="10" REF="7">
the States iuri&s;diction, nor how the Townes are diuided, though the whole Countrey in a man|ner is in the Arch-Dutche&s;&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but the truth is, that the Gouernour of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> taking aduantage of certaine Companies, which mar|ched out of <HI>Bergen</HI> toward <HI>Breda,</HI> and vnder&s;tan|ding that the Gouernour of <HI>Bergen</HI> was al&s;o ab|&s;ent, &s;ent <HI>Spinola</HI> word of the &s;ame, who pre&s;ent|ly proiected to make v&s;e thereof, and take ad|uantage of their ab&s;ence: and the truth is, that the Gouernour being called as they &s;ay <HI>Rehonen,</HI> perceiuing his Commi&s;&s;ion growing to an end, and vnder&s;tanding that the Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> was comming with his Army toward <HI>Breda,</HI> tooke a Conuoy of 2000. and went thither with intent and purpo&s;e to renue his Patents, but ere hee came there, a Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent vnto him to returne in all ha&s;t to his Gouernment, for the Enemy was on foot and had &s;ome proiect in hand, which &s;omewhat amazed him, con&s;ide|ring as he thought hee had not full Authority to commaund the Garri&s;ons: notwith&s;tanding this meditation, the nece&s;&s;ity of the time ouer|&s;wayed all nicety and exceptions, and hee re|turnes very opportunely with all his Company to the Towne.</P>
<P><HI>Spinola</HI> followes his fir&s;t purpo&s;e, and ap|points 3000. from <HI>Antwerpe</HI> to giue the at|tempt: among whom they will haue the Earle
<PB N="11" REF="7">
of <HI>Argiles</HI> Regiment to bee thru&s;t: the charge and rule of this Company is committed into the hands of two Spaniards, the one called <HI>Bor|gia,</HI> the other <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay <HI>Lewis de Vela&s;co</HI> Gouernour of <HI>We&s;ell,</HI> who vnder&s;tanding the re|&s;olution of the Armies to quarter about <HI>Brabant,</HI> found occa&s;ion to bee di&s;penced withall, and at|tend the &s;eruice nearer home.</P>
<P>Well, let the Names pa&s;&s;e, the Company march downe apace, and with all expedition take the &s;ame &s;ide of the Riuer where <HI>Bergen</HI> &s;tands, but it &s;hould &s;eeme they came &s;hort halfe a day at lea&s;t: For before they had mar|ched 7. Engli&s;h mile, they vnder&s;tand how <HI>Ber|gen</HI> was &s;upplyed (as you haue heard) yet they goe forward, and come at la&s;t to their Rendey|uous, where they grewe &s;o angry and exa&s;pera|ted, that they would needs giue an attempt in a rage both on the Wall, and at the Ports, where the Cannon from the Towne played &s;o violent|ly, and the Musket at re&s;t &s;hot &s;o effectually, that they lo&s;t 600. men at the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault, the mo&s;t of them Iri&s;h and Engli&s;h newly come out of their Countries.</P>
<P>This began on Wedne&s;day as I take it the Tenth of Iuly: the next day they attempted a|gaine, and proffered another A&s;&s;ault, but heere
<PB N="12" REF="8">
they were repul&s;ed with a Salley, in which a va|liant Colonell Scotchman lo&s;t his life in the be|halfe of the Towne, but it was a deare lo&s;&s;e to the Enemy: For before the skirmi&s;h ended, there lay 200. on the ground, and they were enforced to retire, &s;ome will haue them fight the third day likewi&s;e, but I thinke that was imployed in another bu&s;ines, for the Enemy finding the re|&s;i&s;tance of this &s;trong Towne, tooke another cour&s;e and marched to a weaker, I meane <HI>Steen-Bergen,</HI> which not able to endure either battery or a&s;&s;ault, they ea&s;ily tooke by compo&s;ition, as al&s;o a Sconce by it, which they obtained with finall repul&s;e.</P>
<P>I haue yet &s;aid little of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who thought as little of this attempt or enter|pri&s;e, but onely &s;uppo&s;ed that Breda or Sluice might bee the obiect of his Sommers imploy|ment, and &s;o the Warre to continue either in Brabant or Flaunders, whereupon hee brought downe mo&s;t of his Forces, and &s;etled him&s;elfe a while about <HI>Schetogen Bo&s;ch,</HI> and was (as they &s;aid) him&s;elfe gone toward <HI>Rees,</HI> where hee &s;ur|ueyed the Townes in the States po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and tooke order, that all the Garri&s;ons &s;hould bee ready to come into the Field at his appoint|ment, for which purpo&s;e hee al&s;o &s;ent to the Commaunders and Captaines that were in England, to come ouer with expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="8">In the meane while this was done, as you haue heard, the Gouernour <HI>Reehouen</HI> returned to his charge, and ordred <HI>Bergen</HI> again&s;t the Ob&s;e&s;&s;ion and expugnation, if <HI>Spinola</HI> &s;o determined the matter.</P>
<P>Now they will haue 2000. foote, and 300. hor&s;e all ready in the towne, among&s;t whom they haue named the companies of Sir <HI>Th. Winn,</HI> Sir <HI>Michaell Eueret,</HI> Captaine <HI>Appleton,</HI> who had mar|ried a Dutch woman and dwelt in the &s;ame place, with diuers others attending the &s;eruice, and the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e troubles: the greate&s;t part of the ar|my lying, as I &s;ayd, about <HI>Breda,</HI> a towne of their owne, and <HI>Schetogen Bo&s;ch</HI> belonging to the Arch-Dukes, which peraduenture they determined to be&s;iege, howeuer they may now be di&s;appointed, either in rai&s;ing the enemy from <HI>Bergen,</HI> or im|ploying them&s;elues to ouer-looke their actions, if they continue there this Sommer.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>Spinola</HI> vnder&s;tands what is done on both &s;ides, and how his forces haue beene di&s;|appointed, which made him alter his purpo&s;e for a Rendez-vous at <HI>Mae&s;trich,</HI> and draw all his Gar|ri&s;ons toward <HI>Antwarp</HI> out of <HI>Mechlin, Ar&s;chot, Hu&s;&s;et, Bi&s;&s;ell,</HI> and other townes and villages, where they had wintred: &s;o that though he lay him&s;elfe &s;till in per&s;on at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> vpon greater matters of importance: yet he di&s;po&s;ed of his bu&s;ines, that the country was re&s;olued, he determined an ab&s;olute &s;iege: for 15. peeces of Ordnance were &s;ent out of <HI>Antwarp</HI> downe the Riuer, and 10000. more men marched by land to the new begun Campe. Hee
<PB N="14" REF="9">
al&s;o &s;ent &s;upplyes to the Gouernour of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> with a &s;peciall command to haue an eye vpon <HI>Slui&s;e,</HI> and make &s;ome attempt that way, as occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erue. It is al&s;o &s;ayd that the Gouernours of <HI>Ipren</HI> and <HI>Li&s;&s;e</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> who had lo&s;t a &s;onne in a skir|mi&s;h in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> de&s;ired to bee at this &s;er|uice.</P>
<P>All this while the &s;iege is but preparing, for the army was not quite come downe, nor the proui&s;ion for the expugnation brought together, as Hurdles, Gabions, Cariages, Munition, Traces for hor&s;es, Carts, Wagons, and &s;uch like: yet was &s;ome ex|traordinary matter accompli&s;hed: for the Po&s;t of <HI>Antwarp</HI> reports, and the letters certifie as much that they heard the Cannon play thither: &s;o that by all likelihood it is fully re&s;olued, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ettle them&s;elues to the enterpri&s;e, although they want men to fill vp their companies, as hauing lo&s;t this winter by ca&s;ualty at lea&s;t 6000.</P>
<P>They &s;ay, that in the fir&s;t attempt there were &s;o many dead bodyes, that thirty Wagons at once haue come with them into <HI>Antwarp,</HI> and in the lat|ter enterpri&s;es the towne was &s;o &s;trong and well prouided, that they made diuers &s;allies ere their enemies could be &s;etled to their much preiudice, and retired them&s;elues to their fa&s;tne&s;&s;e at plea&s;ure</P>
<P>Other letters a&s;&s;ure vs, that the country &s;ending in three hundred Wagons with proui&s;ion to &s;up|ply the wants of the army, which began already to feele &s;ome inconueniences: they were &s;et vpon by &s;ome of his <HI>Excellencies</HI> troopes and companyes lying about <HI>Breda,</HI> as they were going ouer the

Heathes, wide of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and &s;o after a skirmi&s;h &s;urpri&s;ed: for the Conuoy lagging behinde, and not keeping together with the re&s;t, &s;marted for the di&s;order, and were compelled to &s;hift for them|&s;elues.</P>
<P>When the States of <HI>Holland</HI> vnder&s;tood of all the&s;e proceedings, they be&s;tirred them&s;elues and &s;ent diuers men of warre to attend about <HI>Zealand,</HI> of which &s;ome of them &s;tept into the riuer, to in|tercept &s;uch boates, as &s;hould come from <HI>Antwerp</HI> to the army: the re&s;t that kept the Sea behaued them&s;elues &s;o well, that the Letters &s;ay, they tooke a &s;hip full of Souldiers going to <HI>Dunckirke,</HI> whom they examined and finding that the Souldiers knew no other, but that they went into the Low Countries, they hanged vp the Lieutenant and carried all the re&s;t pri&s;oners to <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> re&s;ol|uing to watch for tho&s;e companies which are co~|ming out of <HI>England</HI> to &s;erue the Archduches. For rumor cannot be &s;o &s;paring but that they know by name the Captaines of euery Countrey and the manner of rai&s;ing their men.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other things the Marchants a&s;&s;ure vs, that at this in&s;tant there lie fiftie or &s;ixtie &s;ayle of <HI>Hollanders</HI> and Pirates of <HI>Argier</HI> before <HI>Lisbone,</HI> who not onely watch the harbours and townes but the Sea it &s;elfe, as hauing made a contract with the~ of <HI>Tunis</HI> al&s;o to a&s;&s;ociate and defend one anothers, both again&s;t <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> whom they re&s;olue to empoueri&s;h and damnifie all they can, as men re&s;olued to haue neither peace nor truce any longer with them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="10">But to returne to the &s;iege at <HI>Bergen,</HI> for all the&s;e attempts it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;iege will not lye long before it, nor the enemy continue with &s;uch re&s;olution, as to make it a worke of &s;uch con&s;e|quence, but euen doe as the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> did in the beginning of this relation leaue it, and take &s;ome other enterpri&s;e in hand, and that for diuers rea&s;ons at this in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e they cannot command the Riuer, but the towne will be relieued at all times by Sea, which they cannot auoyde.</P>
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e the &s;eate of the warre is now as it were in their owne countrey, and the Prince of <HI>Orenges</HI> army mu&s;t both be releeued and &s;et on worke in <HI>Brabant,</HI> euen to the terrifying of the in|habitants.</P>
<P>Thirdly, becau&s;e rumor hath played a womans part, and told them that &s;ome of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> forces are come out of <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> as farre as <HI>Loraine</HI> and <HI>Luizenberg</HI>: and either meane to bee their owne caruers of the ble&s;&s;ings of the&s;e Prouinces, or vnite them&s;elues to the Prince of <HI>Orenge,</HI> if occa|&s;ion &s;erue to increa&s;e his army, and remoue the &s;iege.</P>
<P>Fourthly, becau&s;e they are afraide to want mo|money, con&s;idering their trea&s;ure is &s;o many waies exhau&s;ted, and the Emperor mu&s;t not be neglected in his de&s;ignes.</P>
<P>And la&s;t of all, becau&s;e there are many hollow hearts in <HI>Antwarp,</HI> and what know they whether (be&s;ides the trea&s;on that may bee wrought) the Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> if the peace of the <HI>Palatinate</HI>
