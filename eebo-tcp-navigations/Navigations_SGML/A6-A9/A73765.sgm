<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentle Reader:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>_I</HI> Confe&s;&s;e vnto you, when this let|ter came first into my hand; which was about the 20 of <HI>De|cember,</HI> brought as it &s;hould &s;eeme by &s;ome of the last <HI>Vene|tian</HI> company, I read it as a thing according to the Italian phra&s;e, <HI>trouata</HI> or <HI>bugiarda;</HI> and chri&s;tned it with this opinion, that it could march in no other rancke of veritie, then amongst our &s;elues the <HI>Su&s;&s;ex Serpent,</HI> the <HI>German Gho&s;ts,</HI> and the great Armie met in <HI>Tar+tarie</HI> marching by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> &s;hore ouer <HI>Taurus,</HI> all which of my owne knowledge came out of the &s;hop of invention, and were beholding more to deui&s;e, then ei|ther religion or di&s;cretion: &s;o that in a manner I di&s;|claimed the tran&s;lating of it, and put it from me with a kinde of contracted brow: but in truth there were cer|taine
<PB REF="4"> rea&s;ons, which got the ma&s;terie ouer my Iudgment, and kept that a while predominant again&s;t further pre|&s;umption. Fir&s;t, the difficultie of the &s;tile, being my &s;elf a very poore Lingui&s;t. For had not the pulling hooke of <HI>Florios</HI> Dictionarie brought many words neerer vnto me, they had all pa&s;&s;ed for &s;trangers, and tho&s;e which you haue, meerely come from the apprehen&s;ion of the &s;en|tence in the coherence of the matter, rather then the par|ticular &s;ignification of the words by them&s;elues. Se|condly, the time, wherein we liue, not like that conci&s;e Hi&s;toriographer <HI>Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> who &s;pake what he thought, and wrote what he &s;pake; but we as &s;oldiers vnder good Commanders, who must &s;imply obey, and though neuer &s;o wi&s;e, di&s;pute not a word by way of con|te&s;tation with the bu&s;ines impo&s;ed. Thirdly, a priuate conference with &s;ome <HI>Italians,</HI> who only put it off with a &s;hrug of the &s;houlder, when any thing is di&s;tasting vn|to them: although &s;ome of them went further, and cryed out aloud, as their manner is, <HI>Cancro</HI> and <HI>Cazzo</HI> when they di&s;like a thing. La&s;t of all, my owne poore affaires, which haue bu&s;ied me otherwi&s;e, and out of the rules of moralitie tyed me to the preuention of wants, and that intolerable and in&s;upportable vexation to depend vpon any mans bountie. For que&s;tionles Friend&s;hip now adaies is but like a fire from a painted cloth, which for all the braue &s;how reflecteth no warmth: &s;o that I may
<PB REF="4"> well conclude with the Dutchman, he neuer fared wor&s;e then when he wi&s;ht for his dinner: notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e rea&s;ons, and &s;ome thing el&s;e more plea&s;antly enfor|ced, the importunitie of my freinds, and that &s;ame <HI>auri &s;acra fames,</HI> got the vpper hand of nicitie, and not on|ly put the booke into my hand, but extracted this poore revolution out of a barren &s;pring, which more and more I confe&s;&s;e opened her &s;elfe from my owne affection to the matter and poore experience of certaine repinings euen amongst the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elues, against the long pro|traction of <HI>Mahomets</HI> returne, being now full 40 yeere elap&s;ed beyond their owne account, and his promi&s;e to bring them glad tidings of a new Paradice: and in truth when I con&s;idered tho&s;e excellent praedictions of Scrip|ture, that Antichrist &s;hall not only be di&s;couered, but euen puni&s;hed in this world; that the Iewes &s;hould be recalled, and all apparantly to be &s;eene before that doome of doomes, and &s;courge of incredulitie, the terror of the last iudgement, I ca&s;t vp a new account for the entertaining this relation, and rancked it thus in the maniple of my endeuors, which though it troupe with a file or two, yet according to the &s;traitnes of the pa&s;&s;age may &s;erue the turne, as well as a greater Armie, or &s;tronger forces. Accept it then, good Reader, and if you be not curious concerning the fullnes of truth, and infallibilitie of the matter; you may make this bulru&s;h of noueltie hold vp
<PB REF="5"> your head in the calmer waters of &s;ecuritie, that you &s;ink not ouer head and eares into pride, contempt, and care|le&s;nes. Fir&s;t, con&s;idering God hath &s;uch a worke to bring to pa&s;&s;e, and he will fini&s;h it in his due time. Secondly, that although the <HI>Vrim</HI> and the <HI>Thummim</HI> cea&s;e, and miracles are very &s;paring; yet the heauens declare the glory of God, and many fearefull accidents haue bin prefigured by apparition. Thirdly, that therefore the heauens burne fir&s;t to light vs the way to repentance, and &s;eeing there mu&s;t come a di&s;&s;olution of all things, to prepare our hearts to put confidence in nothing: Fourth|ly, and that we be not &s;o &s;tupefied, as not to admire the <HI>Apocalyps</HI> of hidden mysteries, but verily belieue there is &s;omething to be done, which we cannot apprehend by rea&s;on. La&s;t of all, to continue our holy duties, e&s;peci|ally priuate prayers, and contrition, which &s;hall &s;o molli|fie our hard hearts, that they &s;hall make the lifting vp of our hands as incen&s;e, and by way of pro|pitiation moue God to continue his mercies, and auert his iudgments from vs.</P>

<P>_ACcording to the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in me, I made my commorance in <HI>Allex|andria,</HI> all the while the goods were vnloding out of the <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> &amp; <HI>Pol|lux</HI> of <HI>Leuca:</HI> wherein I receiued tho&s;e balles of &s;ilke, and roules of gold, for which I pre&s;ently trucked with <HI>Eleazar Bedly</HI> the <HI>Iew,</HI> dwelling in
<PB N="2" REF="6"> the <HI>Semiter</HI> &s;treete of the tribe of <HI>I&s;achar,</HI> and re|ceiued in <HI>&s;ultane&s;es</HI> and vncut &s;tones, what I thought corre&s;pondent to the value, all which I haue returned vnto you by my booke of ac|counts, vnder the tru&s;t of <HI>Bartholomeo Ioco</HI> the <HI>Florentine,</HI> who &s;tandeth charged &amp; is accoun|table for the &s;ame: the greater &s;tuffs and che&s;ts of gla&s;&s;es are entred into the blancks of the cu|&s;tome-hou&s;e, and you &s;hall receiue the bill of <HI>Beniamin Hely</HI> the <HI>Iew,</HI> who is chiefe farmer vn|der the <HI>Ba&s;h&acirc;</HI> for the &s;ame: and &s;o when I had thus ordered your bu&s;ine&s;&s;e with &s;ome cheere|full confidence, that you &s;hould receiue 4. for one; I tooke the opportunitie of a <HI>Turki&s;h Car|mi&s;all,</HI> and went pre&s;ently to <HI>Cayro:</HI> we tooke the middle &s;treame: for you mu&s;t know, that <HI>Nilus</HI> brancheth out with 7. heads into the midland &s;ea, &amp; hauing a plea&s;ant wind North|we&s;t and by north, quickly &s;aluted the riuer in her fulne&s;&s;e, which without controuer&s;ie had driuen vs backe with the &s;wiftne&s;&s;e of his cur|rent, had not the goodne&s;&s;e of our &s;ailes coun|terchecked the violence of his &s;peede, &s;o that we made three daies iorney of this pa&s;sage and although I doe not accu&s;tome to fill vp a pri|uate letter with publike di&s;cour&s;es, either con|cerning
<PB N="3" REF="6"> <HI>Topography</HI> or <HI>Poligraphy,</HI> yet cannot I o|uer pa&s;&s;e an accident that happened vnto vs the &s;econd day: For a little a fore noone we heard a great cry among the reedes, and wondring what it was, we might well perceiue it was no|thing but a crocadile howling ouer a woman, whom it had caught? as if a heard of wolues had bin comming downe the mountaine to barke at the moone. And truly <HI>Good Sir,</HI> it is &s;trange to relate, how rauenous and fell in de|&s;ires the&s;e creatures are of women, and will hunt them extreamely by the &s;ent, imitating the <HI>Allegators</HI> of <HI>Guinea,</HI> neuer to &s;how their bodies till they can obteine their pray: yea &s;uch is their manner, that they will pa&s;&s;e by children and men, and take onely the oportunitie to &s;urpri&s;e the women, whom they will &s;trip as han&s;om|ly of their apparell, after they haue brought them to their ne&s;ts, as if they had bin taught a kind of cunning not to be combred with their &s;lutti&s;hne&s;s: yet mu&s;t I not let pa&s;se this &s;ecret of nature, that they commonly v&s;e to pinch the necke and head &s;o at the fir&s;t, that the mi&s;e|rable wretch left to a pray findeth a curte&s;ie in the di&s;patch of her life, for otherwi&s;e it were a thou&s;and deaths to be &s;o long a dying, con&s;i|dering
<PB N="4" REF="7"> &s;he is three howres a howling ouer the body, before &s;he deuoure it, of which yet how rauenous &s;o euer &s;he be, &s;he leaues the head on|ly vntouched, but after &s;he hath done howling, &s;he eates, after eating &s;he weepes, after weeping &s;he &s;leepes, &amp; then, they are many times &s;laine, and their young ones &s;tolne from them: this was the voice we heard, and within an hower after we met a boat of <HI>Aegiptians,</HI> who came to &s;eeke the woman, and di&s;couered vnto vs, that &s;he was a poore mans wife, that had beene to gather reedes that morning with her husband, and by rea&s;on of &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure, thought to be reuenged by &s;eque&s;tring her &s;elfe, and &s;o was &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;erpent, as a warning to o|ther women, not to make euery &s;mall vnkind|ne&s;s, the author of a lumpi&s;h countenance, or a &s;ullen heart: the next day we aproached the great Citie, of which to talke neuer &s;o little, would make my letter to great, and be&s;ides you haue bin in the&s;e parts your &s;elfe, &amp; make dai|ly v&s;e of mo&s;t <HI>vberant</HI> relations, &amp; remarkable circum&s;tances. It was not long ere I prepared my lodging, nor long ere <HI>Signior Stephano Del|phino</HI> came vnto me, who finding more conue|niency in mine then his owne, quickly &s;etled
<PB N="5" REF="7"> him&s;elfe to beare me company, nor long ere the great <HI>Carauan</HI> troup of marchants ariued from <HI>Ormus,</HI> who came the next way ouer <HI>Ara|bia</HI> with 600. Camels, and 200. <HI>Arabian</HI> hor&s;e for their <HI>Conuoy,</HI> who&s;e intertainement for 5. weekes co&s;t the Merchants 3000. <HI>Checkinoes</HI> a|mong&s;t them: they onely taried a day and a night to make them&s;elues drunke; which they may quickly doe. For though the wine of <HI>Pa|le&s;tina,</HI> which we much vented here, be rea&s;ona|ble good, yet as if they would plea&s;ure <HI>Bacchus</HI> with an vn&s;atiate de&s;ire to cellebrate his <HI>Orgies,</HI> they intermingled the berries of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> who&s;e ful&s;ome iuyce doe rather intoxicate the braine, then quench the thir&s;t: The next day they de|parted, and the next day I &s;ingled out the com|panie, to finde what <HI>Italians</HI> were among&s;t them: For in a word I neuer &s;aw &s;o many &s;tran|gers in one iourney and agreeing &s;o well toge|ther, the report of it was plea&s;ant, but when I heard it from their owne mouthes, it added both delight &amp; conte~tme~t, I could both name the parties and the places of their aboad. But becau&s;e I aime at another marke I will not vn|furni&s;h my quiuer to &s;pend a rouing &s;haft to no purpo&s;e, but in a word, here were many of my
<PB N="6" REF="8"> acquaintance, among&s;t whome only <HI>Siluano Gritti</HI> and <HI>Bartholomeo Caponi</HI> with two friers, one an <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> another of the order of <HI>Serui,</HI> lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with vs: They &s;pent three daies in re&s;t, and re&s;ted the night very &s;oundly, yet the friers were many times iang|ling, and &s;o angred <HI>Signior Stephano,</HI> that ouer-pa&s;&s;ionate one night he bad the deuill take them, whether they cro&s;&s;ed them&s;elues or no: the darkne&s;s interdicted my di&s;couerie, but I will be &s;worne, I heard them thump their brea&s;ts to my bed, and I intreated my <HI>Gent:</HI> to let them alone. Oh, &s;aid the <HI>Mendicant</HI> frier, lit|tle do you know the di&s;ceptation betweene vs, and le&s;&s;e may we in&s;truct you in it, till a fitter opportunity. For we haue &s;uch a &s;trange &s;to|ry to di&s;cour&s;e vpon, as will &s;pend a day in the <HI>Epitome,</HI> and make all <HI>Europe</HI> to wonder in the exemplification.</P>
<P>Truly good <HI>Sir,</HI> the very <HI>Empha&s;is</HI> of his words ama&s;ed me, and the ouer de&s;ire of in|&s;truction led me pre&s;ently to the way of vigi|lancy, and I &s;at vp in my bed, as if I meant to heare a tale indeede, had not <HI>Signior Stephano</HI> made me al&s;o the &s;ubiect of his anger, and bad me go out of the bed, if I was &s;o womani&s;h and
<PB N="7" REF="8"> idle, that I could not tarry til day light, to heare a lying tale of a frier.</P>
<P>Till this the <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> frier was &s;ilent, but now in &s;ome di&s;temperature rai&s;ed his <HI>pa&s;sion,</HI> as high as euer <HI>Signior Stephanoes</HI> was, telling him to his face, it was &s;poke like a <HI>Lutherane,</HI> and <HI>Heretick,</HI> to lay any &s;uch imputation on men of their qualitie, religious ob&s;eruants, and father-confe&s;&s;ors. For they made a con&s;cience of tel|ling an vntruth, and acknowledged it more then a <HI>Veniall</HI> &s;in to countenance a lie through the credit of any religious order: well; &s;aid <HI>Sig|nior Stephano</HI> if you will not lie in your words, yet I pray you lie &s;till in your beds, and it &s;hall be part of my penance, to acknowledge mine error, and make a retractation of offending you: This an&s;were made way to the &s;edation of this vnquietne&s;&s;e, and &s;o we gaue ouer our parlee, and made &s;ome v&s;e of a mornings &s;leepe.</P>
<P>The next day the friers of them&s;elues remem|bring their <HI>Matutine</HI> howers, after deuotion was ouerpa&s;&s;ed, came voluntarilie into our chamber, and with a &s;mall preamble of pacifi|cation preuailed &s;o much with my compani|on, (who by this time was as de&s;irous of the
<PB N="8" REF="9"> <HI>nouelty,</HI> as my &s;elfe) that we aro&s;e, and becau&s;e they would not bee interrupted in their di&s;|cour&s;e, we made a &s;hort repa&s;t together, and &s;o locking the dore to vs, attended the poore <HI>Men|dicant;</HI> who thus began.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> Brother and <HI>I about the tenth of September,</HI> embarked our &s;elues from <HI>Ormus,</HI> and came to <HI>Catara,</HI> where the <HI>Chri&s;tian Carauan</HI> was almo&s;t ready for their voyage to <HI>Cayro,</HI> but before I proceed any further, I will be plaine to tell you the occa&s;ion of our going thither; 1. partly for Curio&s;ity; 2. partly for Deuotion; 3. partly for Wealth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, for curio&s;ity, the de&s;ire of acquain|taince with forraigne Countries, and the wil|lingne&s;&s;e to put the <HI>Practique</HI> in the other &s;cale again&s;t the <HI>Theory;</HI> or, if you plea&s;e, to make our &s;uperficiall reading the &s;weeter by indu&s;trious experience, taught vs the way to conceiue, that all Countries might be nationall to a wi&s;e man.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, concerning Deuotion, hauing long &s;ince heard, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in this place condi&s;cended euen again&s;t the rule of their <HI>Al|choran,</HI> to communicate with certaine <HI>Portingall</HI> Friers, about the <HI>Verity</HI> of both Religions, wee
<PB N="9" REF="9"> thought it not ami&s;&s;e to put it to the triall, whe|ther we might attaine to &s;uch a meritorious act as the <HI>Conuer&s;ion of a Mahumetane.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly, concerning Wealth, at the end of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> there is a generall fi&s;hing for Pearle, by rea&s;on that the <HI>Oy&s;ters</HI> in this hot moneth re|&s;ort to the &s;hore, and as if nature had taught them to breathe for aire, they gape, as it were in &s;holes, and then the fi&s;hers, and &s;uch as are appointed for this purpo&s;e, throw little peble|&s;tones into their mouthes, and &s;o keepe them from clo&s;ing againe; and thus are their Pearles kindly taken out, and knowne to be full ripe by their colour. For you mu&s;t con&s;ider the Pearles growe as the meat in bignes, and yeeld great plentie being &s;oft, but afterwards mo&s;t worth of e&s;timation, as &s;he is <HI>Orientall,</HI> the &s;hell makes that we call <HI>Mother of Pearle,</HI> and in the &s;ame they are ranked together like teeth in ones mouth, as if they were couched in a bed of purpo&s;e; &s;ometimes 15. or 16. in a &s;hell, onely the <HI>Vnion</HI> hath his name of being alone, and I thinke is priuiledged with extraordinary great|ne&s;&s;e by being alone: Now at euery draught (or if you will, cour&s;e of &s;eparation) they haue a cu&s;tome by way of gratuitie, to giue to &s;uch
<PB N="10" REF="10"> religious men as are re&s;ident among&s;t them, to &s;ome more, &s;omele&s;&s;e, according as affection &s;hall induce them, &s;o that for my part &s;uch as they are, I haue 500. to &s;hew you: at <HI>Catara</HI> we had diuers camels, that came from <HI>Iafu</HI> and <HI>Ca|tiffa:</HI> and within three daies according to their cu&s;tome 200. <HI>Arabian</HI> hor&s;se came from <HI>Zoar</HI> and <HI>Cazape:</HI> there was one principall <HI>Aga</HI> and 4. vnder <HI>Captaines,</HI> and &s;o in &s;euerall companies we prepared for the great de&s;ert of <HI>Elact,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch mountaines and &s;trange woods, that the voiage alone were worthy the de&s;cription; in regard we found &s;now in greater aboundance, then is in mount <HI>Sene&s;e,</HI> &amp; &s;o many wild bea&s;ts both on the mountaines, and in the woodes, that we lay not one night without a hedge of fier, &amp; in &s;euerall companies we made a &s;how as it were of a burning campe, and both Lions and Tigers came to &s;ee, what we did, though they dur&s;t not approach, we made thirty daies of this trauell, and ere we came to <HI>Mecha</HI> had only &s;ight of 3. Townes, for who&s;e &s;ake we fetched a great compa&s;s, although the pretence was to auoide the huge&s;t hills, and &s;o we went from <HI>Catara</HI> to <HI>Lagana</HI> to <HI>Salata</HI> and <HI>Gacha:</HI> from thence loding our camells with many skinnes
<PB N="11" REF="10"> and teeth of bea&s;ts, as we vnloded them of our proui&s;ion, we came in good time to <HI>Mecha.</HI> I cannot call it a city becau&s;e it is vnwalled, nor a village, becau&s;e it hath 8000. hou&s;es in it, nor rich becau&s;e the opulent merchant lies at <HI>Liden</HI> a port towne vpon the red &s;ea, &s;ome 50. <HI>Italian</HI> mile from <HI>Mecha,</HI> nor poore becau&s;e it is &s;o po|pulous, for the re&s;ort of &s;o many thou&s;and &s;trangers that come hither to view the tombe of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in which (as I my &s;elfe was) they are all deceiued: for although he was borne heere, and hath <HI>Charactered</HI> with his <HI>Fame</HI> one of the gloriou&s;e&s;t &s;tories in the world, yet was he not buried heere, but by a &s;trange policie tran&s;lated ouer a great de&s;ert, to <HI>Medina Talnabi,</HI> where at this hower is both his Temple and his Sepulcher; by the way you come to the pretty towne of <HI>Tacine:</HI> &amp; how&s;oeuer any man pre&s;umes of his own cunning, &amp; better intelli|gence, yet from what coa&s;t &s;oeuer he comes, he mu&s;t go to <HI>Mecha</HI> fir&s;t, and their receiue a ticket from the <HI>Beglerbeag;</HI> for which he paies halfe a florence ducket, ere he can be admitted into the <HI>Conuoy</HI> for <HI>Medina:</HI> a littell apprehen&s;ion brought vs to the knowledge of the&s;e things, and &s;o by generall con&s;ent, my brother and I

<PB N="30" REF="20"> di&s;putation with me, I told them plainely, that the originall of <HI>Mahomet</HI> was a meere de|ui&s;e, which they might ea&s;ily perceiue by the a&s;&s;otiation of <HI>Sergius</HI> one of our moncks. For if he had beene a <HI>Prophet</HI> of God, he would que|&s;tionle&s;se neuer haue intermingled any deui|&s;es of man: then againe for his prefixed time of returning, it was a thing neuer heard nor red of, that any one returned from the dead, nor &s;hall euer ri&s;e, till the la&s;t di&s;solution, and there|fore how much are you beholding to that God which you doe now wor&s;hip, that hath from heauen di&s;couered vnto you in a vi&s;ion what you mu&s;t tru&s;t vnto in the&s;e latter times, &amp; if you be not &s;tupified with ob&s;tinacy, &amp; remain more &s;tony hearted then euer the <HI>Iewes</HI> were, that crucified the Sauiour of the world, now are glad tidings brought vnto you: For the wo|man, which appeared is que&s;tionle&s;&s;e the Church of God compa&s;sed about with a <HI>Sunne,</HI> repre&s;enting the &s;onne of righteou&s;ne&s;se, euen <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the Sauiour of mankind, without whom no fle&s;h can come to happine&s;se; the booke in her hand is que&s;tionle&s;&s;e the &s;criptures, and the opening of it, prefigureth the &s;earching and contemplation of the &s;ecrets: but whereas &s;o
<PB N="31" REF="20"> great an army &s;til fled, as &s;he opened the booke, how can any thing be per&s;onated by it, but that both <HI>Per&s;ians, Moores,</HI> and your &s;elues, will be a&s;hamed and aba&s;hed to conceiue in what a &s;otti&s;h ignorance and &s;encele&s;s blindne&s;se, you haue beene &s;o many yeares detained, therefore embrace the truth, and returne to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which will bring you into the direct path of &s;aluation, and in the end the glorious king|dome of heauen. Why replied one of the <HI>Doc|tors,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iewi&s;h Doctors.</NOTE> how can this be? your prophet was but a man, as ours was, and for inuentions of men your religion exceeds, and farre exceedes tho&s;e <HI>fanaticall</HI> impo&s;itions, as you terme them that euer <HI>Mahomet</HI> gaue vs.</P>
<P>But among all as the <HI>Iewes</HI> haue often told you, there be three or foure &s;uch &s;trange things in your religion, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for an ho|ne&s;t re&s;olution to apprehend, that God would be &s;erued &s;o foppi&s;hly, and childi&s;hly: Fir&s;t the erecting of Images: did God ca&s;t away the <HI>Iewes,</HI> &amp; as I haue heard, cur&s;ed <HI>Ieroboams</HI> calues, yea rent the kingdome from your great <HI>Salo|mon,</HI> and all becau&s;e he gaue way to the <HI>Idols</HI> of his wiues, and will you haue~ vs be &s;o entangled againe, as to heap vp vengeance for &s;o foule
<PB N="32" REF="21"> an ab&s;urdidie on our owne heads? Beleeue it, it will neuer be and it is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly your prophanation of the <HI>Sab|both.</HI> Doe we or the <HI>Iewes</HI> buy and &s;ell as you doe? labour and trauell, eat and gurmandize, gamboll and play, dance, and &s;ing and com|mit &s;uch abu&s;es on that day, as if all the weeke were tied into one bundell, and then &s;et open to flori&s;h her expences.</P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly your di&s;pen&s;ations with &s;inne and &s;elling of indulgences for mony: O God! is God a receiuer of money? or what conceit haue you to thinke, that he that is all loue and mercy, will be corrupted with reward, or brought about with mercenary bribes?</P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;t of all your &s;umptuous liues, and ex|ce&s;&s;e of vanity, wherein your <HI>Cardinals</HI> goe be|yond greater princes, and &s;hame indeede their profe&s;&s;ion with vn&s;anctified &s;uperfluitie: I name no more becau&s;e, I know the&s;e be vn an|&s;werable and not capable of the di&s;tinction of per&s;onall falts.</P>
<P>With that I replied, although the&s;e might be all well excu&s;ed with circum&s;tantiall infirmi|ties, and apologicall inferences, that the maine points of &s;aluations are held among&s;t them,
<PB N="33" REF="21"> yet you know, we haue oppo&s;ed <HI>Rome</HI> in the&s;e things, and not only returned the pride of their &s;upremacy vpon their heads, but di&s;couered their tirannous v&s;urpation of our rights. For Chri&s;tianity began in <HI>Antioche</HI> and the <HI>Greekes</HI> were the fir&s;t receiuers of the truth, long before the <HI>Latines,</HI> therefore belieue it without fur|ther di&s;puting, vnle&s;s we had time to ouer look <HI>Ptolemeis</HI> library of 200000. bookes, both <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hall be di&s;robed, <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> di&s;couered, &amp; the riuer of <HI>Tiber</HI> flow with bloud, as this the rayning of bloud prefigureth, and <HI>Mahometh</HI> him&s;elfe proued an impo&s;tor, &s;o that both <HI>Iewes</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> doe what you can, and &s;ay what you li&s;t, &s;hall be taken into our fold, and &s;et downe in the accounts of Gods &s;heepe, and the <HI>Chri&s;ti|an flock of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>When I had made an end of my &s;peech, I prote&s;t I cannot tell; whether I left them to the extremity of rage or laughter: For they were &s;o farr from approouing my words, that they cri|ed out it was pitty &s;uch a fellow &s;hould liue, &amp; &s;o the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> to &s;hew him&s;elfe a true maintai|ner of the <HI>Othoman</HI> glory, committed me to pri|&s;on, where I remained, vntill &s;uch time as their came a new enforcement again&s;t me, for hid|ing
<PB N="34" REF="22"> out of the way certaine knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> &s;laues, and taken by their gallies in a florentine &s;hip as &s;uppo&s;ed to ioyne with the pyrates, that had proiected the &s;urpri&s;ing of <HI>Scanderon:</HI> but the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> willing to &s;aue my life, as much af|fecting the&s;e gray haires, my former demea|nor, and that outward proportion I carry, &s;hip|ped me from <HI>Rhodes</HI> to <HI>Alex:</HI> and hath confined me an exile to <HI>Aegipt,</HI> with licence to liue in <HI>Cayro</HI> as I li&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence aro&s;e a new contention betweene the Friers and him&s;elfe, about the Popes &s;uprema|cie, &amp; the augmentation of the Clergies pow|er from the donation of Princes, and the &s;uffra|ges of generall Councels, but the Archbi&s;hop quickly cut them of, and told them plainely, that the Italian Bi&s;hop was but an v&s;urper, and he made no doubt but the raining of bloud in|to Tyber prefigured the de&s;truction of Rome, &amp; the &s;hining of the Sunns an hereafter mani|fe&s;tation of greater truth: For fellowes, &s;aith he, you know, that our <HI>Iohn, Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI> beganne the&s;e tumors of ambition, again&s;t whom your Bi&s;hop of Rome, called the Great <HI>Gregorie</HI> oppo&s;ed, a&s;suring him that any a&s;&s;ump|tion of &s;uch an vniuer&s;al title was antichri&s;tian

<P>WHat I haue done, you now both &s;ee &amp; read.
