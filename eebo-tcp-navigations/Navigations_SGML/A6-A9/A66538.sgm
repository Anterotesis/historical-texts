<HEAD><HI>THE CASE OF</HI> JOHN WILMORE Truly <HI>and</HI> Im|partially <HI>Related,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOlomon</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t of Men &s;aith, <HI>there is a time for all things, a time to &s;peak and a time to keep &s;ilence;</HI> and if ever a time for the latter; &s;urely it is <HI>now:</HI> For let a Man Act, Speak or Write never &s;o much for the true Intere&s;t of the King and Kingdom, and the ancient Con&s;titutions of the &s;ame, and he &s;hall be &s;ure to be di&s;canted upon and <HI>ridiculed,</HI> and the words wre&s;ted and tur|ned from the plain and genuine Sence of them by the &s;ophi&s;tical <HI>canting Infe|rences</HI> and fal&s;e Rea&s;onings of Mr. <HI>Ob&s;ervator</HI> and his Fellows, who as is plain|ly &s;een to the meane&s;t thinking men, are driving on furiou&s;ly, <HI>Jehu</HI> like for &s;etting up a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary</HI> intere&s;t in the Nations, and though their <HI>bait</HI> be cryed up to be loyal Prote&s;tants, and for the Government as e&s;tabli|&s;hed; yet their <HI>Roman hooks</HI> and <HI>French Lines</HI> cannot be hid, I do expect great comments by them will be made upon the putting out of my Ca&s;e, and how I might have &s;pared my pains in troubling of the World with a large <HI>Ig|noramus</HI> Story, for that there is a <HI>Verdict</HI> again&s;t me, that &s;hews what I am, with much more &s;uch &s;tuff. Now had my Ca&s;e been <HI>&s;ingle,</HI> and I had &s;uffered never &s;o unju&s;tly by it, though it had been my ruine, I would have been &s;ilent, and with patience waited the time of the <HI>Great Lord Chief Ju&s;tice</HI> of all the earth, who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion is in him&s;elf for ever, and who will do right, and cannot do wrong, for he is infallible, and no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. But con|&s;idering as I am made the fir&s;t <HI>Example</HI> of this kind, and may not be the <HI>last,</HI> e&s;pecially if Popi&s;h malice &s;ee it for their advantage, &s;eeing <HI>many thou&s;ands</HI> of people are concerned in mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable parts of this Kingdom, and <HI>Ireland,</HI> either in one Plantation or other in <HI>America,</HI> I thought it my du|ty for <HI>their &s;akes</HI> to give the World a true and impartial <HI>State</HI> of my Ca&s;e, that it might be a <HI>Looking-Gla&s;s</HI> to them, thereby to &s;ee what they mu&s;t ex|pect, if malice will pro&s;ecute.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with any thing done in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> lea&s;t it &s;hould be reflected upon as arraigning the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of the Nation, I &s;hall only give you the Truth of it, as it was before it went in there, and &s;omething of their witne&s;&s;es. Were my Accu&s;ation as <HI>Tomp&s;on</HI> and his gang have given out for being a <HI>Kidnapper</HI> or <HI>Stealer of Children,</HI> I mu&s;t have acknowledged it
<PB N="2" REF="3">to have been abominable, for of all theft, the &s;tealing of a Child is the great|e&s;t, nothing being &s;o dear in the world to Parents as their Children, and I ble&s;s God, in my whole life, I never &s;ent over Sea, Man, Woman, or Child, without their <HI>free con&s;ent.</HI> The matter of Fact in truth (for which I am now troubled) is this: In March la&s;t was two years, I &s;ent &s;everal workmen, as <HI>Carpenters</HI> and others upon wages to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> we came down to take water at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> but the Tide was not ready, I had be&s;ides my workmen a boy bound to me by Ju&s;tice <HI>Da&s;hwood</HI> of <HI>Hackney,</HI> to &s;end to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> being a poor boy he had kept; I had al&s;o with me a boy of Mr. <HI>Alexander Ho&s;eas,</HI> bound to him by his friends, to go to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> We went into an hou&s;e, to &s;tay till the Tide was ready, and bought &s;ome Pipes, Tobacco and Brandy, to take with us in the boat, we had not been long in the hou&s;e, but (as boys u&s;e to do, who cannot &s;it long in a place) the two boys went out to play upon the Key or Wharf, they had not been there long, but another boy, one <HI>Richard Ceviter,</HI> as he &s;aid his name was, came to them, and di&s;cour&s;ing together, the &s;aid <HI>Civiter</HI> under&s;tanding they were going to Sea, told them he would go too, whereupon the boys came and told me, there was a boy would go to Sea with them, I bid them bring him in, whereupon he came, when I &s;aw him, I told him <HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed he was &s;ome mans <HI>Son,</HI> or <HI>Servant,</HI> therefore would not meddle with him, and bid him go and mind his Fathers or Ma&s;ters bu&s;ine&s;s, he replied to me, <HI>He had neither Father, Mother, nor Ma&s;ter, nor any friend</HI> he knew of, where he might have Bread; yet <HI>I</HI> was not &s;atisfied, but bid him begon, <HI>I</HI> would not meddle with him, &s;o he went out, and the boys al&s;o, and <HI>I</HI> thought I was quit of him, but the two other boys went in|to my boat, and this <HI>Civiter</HI> al&s;o, unknown to me, went with them, when the <HI>Tide</HI> was ready, the water-men called us to go, and when we came into the boat and found there al&s;o <HI>Civiter,</HI> I bid him be gon out, for <HI>I</HI> would have nothing to do with him, but he prayed me for Gods &s;ake, and Cryed and Roared, and unle&s;s <HI>I</HI> would have turned him out by Head and Shoulders, he would not go; whereupon <HI>One</HI> from the Key &s;ide, as <HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;e &s;eing the bu|&s;tle in the Boat to get the boy out, called to me and told me, if <HI>I</HI> took the boy <HI>I</HI> &s;hould do a <HI>Charitable deed,</HI> for that he had been a little before <HI>pilfering of Sugar</HI> upon the Key, and might come to the <HI>Gallows</HI> if he &s;tayed here, but might make an hone&s;t man if he went beyond Sea; upon this, &amp; the water-mans &s;aying it would be no harm to carry him to <HI>Graves-end; I</HI> was contented; but all the way as we went <HI>I</HI> u&s;ed my be&s;t under&s;tanding in his examining that if po&s;&s;ible <HI>I</HI> could find him <HI>vary</HI> from his fir&s;t &s;tory, but <HI>I</HI> &s;ee he &s;till held in one tale, only made this addition, that his Father and Mother were dead, and that there was much Rent owing to the Landlord, and he came and &s;eiz|ed the Goods for Rent, and turned him out of Doors, and he had no place to go to, &s;o was forced to wander about.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Graves-end,</HI> I was not &s;atisfied, but had the boy before the Mayor, who examined him as I had done before; and he kept &s;till in his old Tale; for if the Mayor could have found out from him any <HI>Parents</HI> or place of aboad, he would undoubtedly, as the Law directs, have given him Cor|rection, and &s;ent him back with his <HI>Pa&s;s,</HI> but &s;eeing he could find no Parents nor place to &s;end him to; he asked him then, what he would do, he &s;aid <HI>he would go to Sea,</HI> and &s;aid if this Gentleman (meaning me) would not take him he would go with any that would, and if he could not go in this Ship, he
<PB N="3" REF="3">would go in &s;ome other; the Mayor &s;eeing the ca&s;e &s;o plain, that the boy was in di&s;tre&s;s; then asked if I was willing to take him, I told him I would, hop|ing he might make and hone&s;t man; the Mayor in an Indenture bound him to me, his Clark being an Attorney, drew the Indentures; the which were Signed and Sealed interchangeably, between the boy and me; the Mayor and his Clark, with the <HI>Kings Searcher</HI> being witne&s;&s;es, and the Boys Indenture being kept for the Boy in the Mayor's Hand; the Law as, <HI>I</HI> take it, putteth the Magi&s;trate to &s;tand in the room of Parents, to poor Children they put out, having no Parents of their own, as this Boy always from fir&s;t to la&s;t denied he had any.</P>
<P>After this was done, I &s;ent the Boy in our Ship the <HI>Granado</HI> to <HI>Jamaica</HI> to my Plantation, where for ought I know he is well, unle&s;s he be put an <HI>Appren|tice</HI> to a Carpenter, or Joyner, as I think &s;ome of our la&s;t Letters have hin|ted.</P>
<P>Thus as brief as I can, <HI>I</HI> have given you the true matter of Fact, and all that then appeared to me, how and in what manner the Boy came to me, and how di&s;po&s;ed of; &s;o <HI>I</HI> wi&s;hed them a good Voyage; and all my expe|ctation and hope in this boy, was that God might make him an hone&s;t man, and when God ble&s;&s;ed him to be for him&s;elf, he might remember that God had rai&s;ed him a friend here, to take that care of him, and provide for him, being then taken by me to be Fatherle&s;s, Motherle&s;s, Friendle&s;s, and help|le&s;s, and as the boy often &s;aid his condition was &s;uch, or el&s;e I had never medled with him; for it is well known to mo&s;t Merchants, that its no <HI>gain,</HI> but commonly and mo&s;tly <HI>lo&s;s,</HI> for any man to &s;end over any Boys, Girls, or Women to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and that <HI>I</HI> had very good Witne&s;&s;es to prove at this ve|ry time, and in this Ship there were two boys bigger then <HI>Civiter,</HI> and by con&s;ent of their friends &s;ent, who well <HI>cloathed</HI> them, and be&s;ides gave Mo|ney to the Merchants to &s;end them to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to be imployed in Plantations, and I dare be bold to &s;ay, that to this time neither Planter nor Merchant to the &s;aid <HI>I&s;land</HI> will take any &s;uch boy <HI>without Money,</HI> for they are at con|&s;iderable charge of keeping, and are of little u&s;e for &s;ome years; and indeed were there &s;afety to the Planter and the I&s;land; <HI>I</HI> am &s;ure the fewer <HI>white</HI> &s;er|vants any Planter has, the more it would be for his profit: but there ha|ving been &s;ome di&s;turbance by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> and the Government finding it might be of dangerous con&s;equence, therefore made an Act for the future, every Plantation &s;hould have one <HI>White</HI> &s;ervant, to every ten <HI>Blacks,</HI> being intended only for the <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> of the I&s;land, and it is not the profit as I &s;aid be|fore, but an Increa&s;e of charges to the Planters; what profit there is, comes out of the labour of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> who have little more for their food, then the Earth produceth, and indeed that is very good, it producing &s;everal good <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Roots,</HI> and having many good green Pea&s;e, for many Months in the year; &s;ometimes if the Ma&s;ter of the Plantation be <HI>good natured</HI> and kind, he will allow his <HI>Blacks</HI> &s;alt Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h once a week, and with this they are for the mo&s;t part well contented and very thankful, acknowledging they live better there then they did in their own Country from whence they came, and yet the great labour of all the Plantation is done by the <HI>Blacks,</HI> the <HI>Whites</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s being chiefly to overlook the <HI>Blacks,</HI> and to keep them in awe. <HI>I</HI> dare boldly &s;ay no <HI>White</HI> &s;ervant in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> works near &s;o hard as many of our Husbandmen in this Country, or doth much more then half the work
<PB N="4" REF="4">of a <HI>Black,</HI> and yet is more chargeable in keeping then five <HI>Blacks,</HI> and this argument alone is enough to &s;atisfie any man, that no Planter in his wits will keep more <HI>White</HI> &s;ervants than the <HI>Law</HI> of the Country commands him, but le&s;s if he could; I have already given you the food of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> which is all their charge, only once a year &s;o much <HI>Blew Linnen,</HI> as will cover their Nakedne&s;s, and a knit Cap of about eight pence a piece; now the Charges of every White Servant is as followeth, every year <HI>new Clad</HI> from top to toe, be&s;ides recruits within the year, of Shoos, Stockings, and Shirts and other things, and for their dyet, not only all that the earth produces as the Blacks have, but over and above by act of the Country, as <HI>I</HI> am informed is allowed &s;even pound weight of <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> every week, which is a pound a day; now with good Fruits and Roots, and the bread of the Country, which is ve|ry good, for I heard Sir <HI>Thomas Muddiford</HI> when living here, &s;ay he had rather eat it then ours here, this <HI>I</HI> &s;ay with a pound of Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h a day, <HI>I</HI> &s;uppo&s;e will not be accounted by any rea&s;onable man a &s;hort <HI>Commons,</HI> and if this be not duly allowed them, the &s;ervants upon complaint to a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, &s;hall be immediately relieved, and the Planter &s;everely chekt. Now by all this, let every man judge whether white Servants are hardly dealt with, during their Term there, and when they come out of their times, they have a portion of ground allotted them where they may plant them|&s;elves, and if careful and diligent with Gods ble&s;&s;ing, may live very comfor|tably and well: <HI>I</HI> have known &s;ome my &s;elf that have gone over in a low condition, yet now have arrived to E&s;tates of above <HI>One thou&s;and pound Sterling, per annum,</HI> and the&s;e are Planters; though now the price of Sugar being very low, the Planter hath not that encouragement as for|merly.</P>
<P>And now having given you an account of the care taken for the body of every white &s;ervant, &s;hall give you &s;ome account of what provi&s;ion is made for his <HI>&s;oul</HI> al&s;o; by an Act of the Country, every Pari&s;h in the I&s;land is to allow to their Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter, 100 l. Sterling <HI>per annum,</HI> and be&s;ides there is many <HI>good Gifts,</HI> and if there be not a good Mini&s;ter in every Pari&s;h, it is not the fault of the Government, for they are willing to give good encou|ragement for good men to come to them, I wi&s;h every Pari&s;h in <HI>England</HI> were able to allow every good Preaching Mini&s;ter 100 <HI>l. per annum;</HI> but this is a digre&s;&s;ion. Now to return to my fir&s;t intended de&s;ign to lay open before you, what farther Circum&s;tances hath come to the knowledg of me, &s;ince my &s;ending the boy away, as afore&s;aid: About a year and aquarter after the boy was &s;ent, comes a Gentleman to me, and tells me there was one <HI>Ci|viter</HI> a <HI>Barber</HI> in <HI>Wapping</HI> had his Son &s;ent over to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and he had heard that <HI>I</HI> &s;ent him, and therefore required <HI>I</HI> would make him &s;atisfaction, <HI>I</HI> asked him what <HI>Civiter</HI> was? he told me he was a poor man, and he heard <HI>I</HI> was rich, therefore he expected Money from me; for that his Son was a <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> to him he being helpful to him in his Trade, upon this <HI>I</HI> told him the matter and manner of Fact in &s;ending the Boy as is before recited, and that it was &s;trange he &s;hould pretend to be his Father, when the Boy denyed he had <HI>Any</HI> living; Al&s;o <HI>I</HI> told him I had done nothing but what was fair, and &s;hould be content any one &s;hould do the &s;ame by <HI>mine,</HI> &s;hould God bring them in the &s;ame Ca&s;e, as the Boy per&s;i&s;ted he was in, as being Fatherle&s;s, Mother|le&s;s, friendle&s;s, pennile&s;s and helple&s;s, and this believed by me: and farther,

Upon this <HI>Vave&s;or</HI> had further Confidence to move the Court, That their VVitne&s;&s;es might be examined in Open Court: which was rejected.

If I did not <HI>immediately</HI> plead; Whereupon I pleaded <HI>NOT GUILTY:</HI> Upon which my Lord ordered a Tryal at Bar of that Court: And, as I told you in the Introduction, I &s;hall not meddle with any thing done by that Court in my Tryal, being a <HI>Noli me Tangere;</HI> yet I hope, without Offence, to Ju&s;tice, in defence of my &s;elf I may touch upon the Material Witne&s;&s;es there produced again&s;t me: one, was <HI>Civiters</HI> wife, who &s;wore &s;everal things again&s;t me: as my Di&s;cour&s;e and Demands at my Lord Mayor's; That there I demanded what Money I had disbur&s;ed in the Boy's Pa&s;&s;age <HI>outwards,</HI> and likewi&s;e what his <HI>Re-pa&s;&s;age</HI> would co&s;t: when as its notoriou&s;ly known by many good Citizens, That tho&s;e things are notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; for that my Offers were as are formerly expre&s;t.

<P>Now, That the Waterman <HI>We</HI> produced was the <HI>Right-man</HI> that carried us, I &s;hall make out by &s;uch a Corroborating Circum&s;tance as &s;hall &s;atisfie all unbya&s;&s;ed per&s;ons, tho, many will &s;ay, Its hard to find a Waterman after 2 years, that but once carried one by Water, or that never &s;aw the man before or &s;ince; but take the Circum&s;tances, and then Judge.

<PB N="16" REF="10">time; and among&s;t other Di&s;cour&s;e, our Waterman told us, That year a Gen|tleman (as I under&s;tand, had &s;ome time before) gave a <HI>Boat</HI> to be towed for, by &s;everal Watermen, and he that came fir&s;t to the place appointed, &s;hould have it: our Waterman &s;aid, He got the Boat that year: By this Token ma|ny of <HI>Billings-gate</HI> watermen told us his Name, and &s;o we found him our, or el&s;e among the Thou&s;ands it had been Impo&s;&s;ible: Therefore whereas the <HI>Popi&s;h Scriblers</HI> have charged me with <HI>Subornation,</HI> and my Witne&s;&s;es with Per|jury.
