<HEAD>True Newes from our NAVIE, now at SEA.</HEAD>
<P>_SInce the departure of his Excellence the Earle of Warwick from our Fleet, we have no way forgot our duty, but beene in a con&s;tant po|&s;ture of War about our coa&s;ts ever &s;ince, watching the approaches of all Ships that might give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Malignants again&s;t the high Court of Parliament. On Saturday the fifth of November two of our &s;hips had in cha&s;e neare the I&s;land of Silley a French bottome, who upon view of us &s;tood out to Sea|ward: Sir <HI>David Murrey</HI> therefore (being a nimble Sailer) undertook her, and after two houres cha&s;e haled her aboard; but &s;he made no an&s;wer, but clapt on more &s;ailes to get the wind, which being &s;omewhat &s;cant &s;he had no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape. After the di&s;charge of two Guns (one of which &s;hore her Mizzen by the board) &s;he came in, being indeed a French Ve&s;&s;ell, and of S. <HI>Malos;</HI> her loading (as her Ma|&s;ter affirmed) being Normandy-Canvas, and other Linnen, and that they were bound for Southampton: Being inquired of why they &s;hunned us, they an&s;wered, they tooke us for Dunkirk men of War. But going down into her hold, un|der &s;ome &s;light packs of linnen cloth (the &s;erpent lurking under that gra&s;&s;e) wee di&s;cerned &s;ome bales of Match, and
<PB N="4" REF="3">barrels of Powder; three hundred Muskets, or thereabouts; three Field-Pieces; five hundred Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tolls, and as many Carabines. So finding by the lading that there was &s;ome further mi&s;chiefe convaied in that Ve&s;&s;ell, Sir <HI>David</HI> examined the Ma&s;ter, for what end all that Ammunition was prepared, by whom put aboard him, and whither bound? After &s;ome flight excu&s;es he told he was bound for Penrin in Cornwall; that he was fraught with tho&s;e goods by the procuration of &s;ome Engli&s;h Gentlemen in S. <HI>Malos;</HI> that that man (pointing to one in a Saylers habit) could better informe; who being &s;trictly called to que&s;tion, was found to be one Ma&s;ter <HI>Greenvill,</HI> a Kin&s;man to Sir <HI>Bevill Green|vill</HI> that perver&s;e Malignant, &s;ent by him and Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> to make purcha&s;e of tho&s;e Armes and that Ammu|nition in France: which partly with money from the fore|&s;aid Knights, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ma&s;ter <HI>Termyn</HI> (who&s;e cred it is good in France) meeting him at S. <HI>Malos,</HI> was pur|cha&s;ed. Letters there were found about the &s;aid <HI>Greenvill,</HI> in certain my&s;tick characters, from Ma&s;ter <HI>Termyn</HI> to the &s;aid Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> and Sir <HI>Bevill Greenvill,</HI> which with the Ve&s;&s;ell we made &s;tay of, intending as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly &s;he could be brought up the River (being an old leaky Ve&s;&s;ell) to &s;end her to London, with the &s;aid <HI>Greenvill</HI> and ammuni|tion, to the di&s;po&s;e of the honourable the Court of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>On Sunday the &s;ixth of November, our Fleet being twelve &s;hips in company, to the &s;tarboard of us we e&s;pied two &s;hips, as far off as we could ken, which made towards us with all &s;ailes: and upon their nearer approach we perceived them to be of good burden, and (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s we conjectured) men of War: they taking us for Merchants bound outward, were re&s;olved to &s;ee our lading; and &s;o comming within &s;ome|thing
<PB N="5" REF="3">neare di&s;tance, they were found to be Turks men of War: They perceiving us not to be the men they tooke us for, tackt about, and faine would have been gone: But the Fidler plaid <HI>No &s;uch matter,</HI> we made account they &s;hould not part &s;o ea&s;ily with us; and &s;o our Rere-admirall Sir <HI>Iohn Menns,</HI> with two of our &s;hips, the <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> and a Mer|chant of five hundred Ton, undertooke them: the Rogues &s;eeing no way but they mu&s;t fight, their wa&s;t-cloaths out, and all things ready, they gave us a broad &s;ide of at lea&s;t thirty Guns from both of them, making amain towards us, hoping (having a full wind to friend, and being light nimble Ve&s;&s;els) to have got through our Fleet and e&s;caped: But Captaine <HI>Millar</HI> that commanded in the Merchant gave their Admirall a &s;alute, that &s;poiled part of his ha&s;te, cut|ting his fore-ma&s;t clean by the board: the <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> al&s;o out of her Fore-ca&s;tle &s;hooting her great Guns at her, tore her without mercy, &s;o that the Rogues were but in an ill plight; yet would they not yeeld, but &s;tood &s;toutly to it, be|ing very well mand, playing upon us with their Muskets, and ca&s;ting fire-pots over into the Merchant-man with great fury and agility, but thanks be to God they did &s;mall hurt. At la&s;t Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> laid their Vice-admirall aboard, and though tho&s;e mi&s;creants would have di&s;charged their Murderers to cleare their Decks, yet our men were got into their Cabin ere they could give fire: with that they cryed for Quarter, which was granted; and their Admirall perceiving his com|panions misfortune, &s;truck his top, and &s;ubmitted him&s;elfe to mercy. There was in both the &s;hips a hundred and forty men left alive, three&s;core being in the fight &s;ent to their Prophets Paradi&s;e. We lo&s;t but foure men. There was in them three&s;core good bra&s;&s;e Guns, eight and thirty in the Admirall, and two and twenty in the other; abundance of
<PB N="6" REF="4">ammunition, which was their lading, being (as their Cap|tain confe&s;&s;ed) bound with it for Ireland, to &s;ell to the Re|bels, with whom they have continuall traffick for tho&s;e com|modities, &s;ince their in&s;urrection: tho&s;e incarnate Devils being debard of all help from Chri&s;tian Princes (to whom they are dete&s;table for their rebellion) trading with the&s;e Turks. How&s;oever, for this time we have mard their mar|ket, and made lawfull prize of men, ve&s;&s;els, and goods, which &s;hortly &s;hall be &s;ent up to London, to te&s;tifie our good wils to &s;erve the King and Parliament.</P>
<P>Within foure dayes after this, one of our le&s;&s;er &s;hips brought in a Holland Catch, which it had taken going to|wards <HI>Milford</HI> haven in Wales, whither it was bound; there being in her a &s;ervant of my Lord <HI>Digbies,</HI> who&s;e Pockets were well &s;tuft with Letters; &s;ome of which, it &s;hould &s;eem tho&s;e of con&s;equence, he ca&s;t over-board: tho&s;e that were found about him, were from his Lord to the Earle of Bri|&s;toll, wherein he much bewailes his ab&s;ence from his coun|trey, wi&s;hing he were here to &s;erve the King again&s;t the Par|liament, entreating him to &s;end him over &s;ome money, for that he was in great want: that for ammunition, as powder, &s;hot, and the like, he was afflicted he could &s;end over no more, having neither credit nor money for that purpo&s;e; which if he had it were to little end, the States being &s;o de&s;i|rous to comply with the Parliament, that they had ab&s;olute|ly prohibited the exportation of that kind of merchandi&s;e. Other letters there were, from him to Commi&s;&s;ary <HI>Wilm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> from Sir <HI>Frederick Cornwallis</HI> to Sir <HI>Edward Stradling,</HI> Ma|&s;ter <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> and other Malignants, but of no impor|tance: How&s;oever, they are with us in &s;afe cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>The next day was brought in by the A&s;&s;urance a French man of Nantz in Brittain, a very good &s;hip; there was no|thing
<PB N="7" REF="4">aboard her but Wines and Linnen cloth: her Cocket &s;poke &s;he was bound for London; and &s;o finding nothing in her that could be prejudiciall to the State or high Court of Parliament, wee di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her in friendly manner. And that afternoon we had &s;ight of two Ve&s;&s;els, but they were &s;o nimble we could not reach them all night; but in the mor|ning by that it was cleare we had gotten within musket &s;hot of them, and found them to be French bottomes. We hal'd them aboard, and after we had well ranged them up and downe, we found great &s;tore of Ammunition in them; &s;ome twelve great barrells of Gun-powder, an hundred Muskets or thereabouts, with much Match: the men we found to be mo&s;t part Iri&s;h, the owners of the Barks being Iri&s;h Friars, Prie&s;ts, and Je&s;uites, that had bought them at Dunkirk, and fraught them with that lading, which they intended (as Fa|ther <HI>Phelim O-Connor</HI> their principall Ring-leader confe&s;|&s;ed) to have tran&s;ported into Ireland, to their Country-men the Rebels; the &s;aid <HI>O-Connor</HI> having about him the Popes Bull, wherein hee gave full ab&s;olution and remi&s;&s;ion of all their &s;innes to tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Catholike cau&s;e in Ire|land, proclaiming all tho&s;e Martyrs that &s;hould &s;uffer death in that quarrell. Our Souldiers and Sea-men made very good &s;port with his Holine&s;&s;e Bull, which (with the Friars) nothing fearing the Popes cur&s;es, we made &s;tay of, as al&s;o of their ammunition, which &s;hall &s;erve to better u&s;e then they intended it. There was al&s;o among other Trinkets a &s;ancti|fied banner, which the Pope had &s;ent to that arch-Rebell Sir <HI>Phelim O-Neale,</HI> creating him his chiefe Champion, and en|tituling him the great <HI>O-Neale,</HI> and King of Ul&s;ter.</P>
<P>The next day, off from the I&s;le of Wight we had another ve&s;&s;ell in &s;ight, and though we did what we could po&s;&s;ible to bring her in, &s;he made &s;o fa&s;t to &s;ea, having a full wind, that
<PB N="8" REF="5">we could not fetch her up: &s;o after all that daies &s;ailing, with the night we lo&s;t &s;ight of her. What &s;he was we could not conjecture, but certainly &s;he was laden with no good Mer|chandize, becau&s;e &s;he refu&s;ed to come in, and fled from us with &s;uch &s;peed. Some were of opinion that &s;he was a Pi|rate, but I rather beleeve &s;he was &s;ome French bottome, fraught with Ammunition, and bound either for Ireland to the Rebels, or to &s;ome of the Malignants; as either to the Marque&s;&s;e Hartford, or the Corni&s;h Malignants.</P>
<P>The next day, which was Friday the eleventh of Novem|ber, it was a mighty Fogge at &s;ea, &s;o that we could not &s;ee a furlong before us: and on a &s;udden came tiding downe the channell three &s;hips of good burden; and ere they e&s;pied us or we them, they were upon us within halfe Musket &s;hot: wherefore we &s;hot off a warning-piece for them to come in, but our Colours being not di&s;cernable by rea&s;on of the Mi&s;t, they refu&s;ed to &s;trike their tops, but let flye a broad &s;ide at us, and we againe at them: but they finding the &s;ervice too hot, ran downe the channell as fa&s;t as they could po&s;&s;ible, &s;triving to quit us; wee thundring on them with our great Guns as fa&s;t as we could po&s;&s;ible. Now the wind beginning to blow, the Fogge cleared, and wee di&s;cerned them to be States Men of War our friends. So heaving &s;ome Cans of Wine one to another, we were very &s;orry for the harme wee had done them, and departed.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the pa&s;&s;ages of note that befell us here late|ly, where thanks be to God we are in good health, re&s;olving to &s;pend our blood in the &s;ervice of the Parliament.</P>
