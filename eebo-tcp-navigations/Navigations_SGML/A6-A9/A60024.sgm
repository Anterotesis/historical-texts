<HEAD><HI>A &s;hort Ab&s;tract of a</HI> Ca&s;e <HI>which was la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions pre&s;ent|ed to the Parliament: Being a true Relation of the Ri&s;e and Pro|gre&s;s of the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Company,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;e is &s;ince Reprint|ed, and Sold by <HI>A. Baldwin</HI> in <HI>Warwick-Lane, London.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&s;hewing how their</HI> Manufactures <HI>have been, are, and will be prejudicial to the</HI> Manufactures <HI>of</HI> England, <HI>and what endeavours have been u&s;ed for and again&s;t any Re&s;trictions. Together with &s;ome</HI> Remarks <HI>and</HI> Query's <HI>thereon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THat for &s;everal Years after the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company was E&s;tabli&s;h'd, they were afraid to bring in Manufactur'd Goods, which they knew were very prejudicial to our own: But now, by their great Stock and Intere&s;t, they are got over the&s;e Fears, and bring in va&s;t quantities, oppo&s;ing all kind of Re&s;traint, tho they are convinc'd, and have declared their Manufactures are prejudicial to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>That as their Manufactures increas'd, our own were di&s;couraged, and <HI>Wooll</HI> reduced &s;o low, that an <HI>Act</HI> was made for <HI>Burying in Woollen,</HI> and the Manufacturers at the &s;ame time reduced to great Nece&s;&s;ities, and many ruined thereby.</P>
<P>That during great part of the late War, the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade was under &s;ome Di&s;cou|ragement, and while it was &s;o, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures flouri&s;hed very much, and exten|ded to &s;everal Places, where, before the People were out of Employment, <HI>Wooll advanced,</HI> and bore a good Price, and all other Provi&s;ions rai&s;ed proportionably.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Engli&s;h Manufacturers</HI> finding the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Traders endeavouring to get an E&s;tabli&s;hment by <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament, and knowing how fatal it might prove to their Ma|nufactures, unle&s;s they were in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;train'd, made their Application to the Parliament, and in Two &s;ucceeding Se&s;&s;ions a Re&s;training Bill was pa&s;t in their Favour in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and a Third being drawn up in a different Method to the Two former, was &s;topt thereupon.</P>
<P>That the Propo&s;al of advancing <HI>Two Millions</HI> for the Supply of the Government, was the great Inducement for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>New Company;</HI> And the Rea&s;ons the Manufacturers did not then &s;o vigorou&s;ly complain and &s;ollicite again&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;hment, as formerly they had done, proceeded from the Fair Promi&s;es given by the <HI>New Ea&s;t-India Men,</HI> and the Hope of a more favourable Opportunity; being unwilling to di&s;turb the Loan, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary then to be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>That the Manufacturers being deceived by the&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Traders Fair Promi&s;es, and finding that the late great Importation and Wear of their <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures are increa&s;|ing, and have already, in a great mea&s;ure, ruin'd the <HI>Canterbury</HI> Trade, and obliged the <HI>London</HI> Weavers to fall upon all &s;orts of Woollen Manufactures, to the Prejudice (and may in a &s;hort time prove to the utter Ruine) of &s;everal Places where &s;uch Manufactures have for a long time been <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> are therefore come again to repre&s;ent their <HI>Deplorable Ca&s;e,</HI> and Pray the Con&s;ideration of this <HI>Parliament,</HI> and hope they will be plea&s;ed to con|&s;ider it as well as either the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies Ca&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>Since the Pre&s;enting the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> above mentioned, There has been from the 20th of <HI>May</HI> 1699,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This appears by a Printed Li&s;t, which is Sold by</HI> Edw. Loyd <HI>at his</HI> Coffee-Hou&s;e <HI>in</HI> Lum|bard-&s;treet.</NOTE> to the 4th of <HI>September</HI> 1699, arrived in <HI>England</HI> from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> Ten Ships, which have brought in above Five Hundred Thou&s;and Pieces of Manufactured Goods, which are by very intelligent Per&s;ons computed to be worth about One <HI>Million</HI> of Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> which va&s;t quantity has already reduced the <HI>Manufactures</HI> of this King|dom (to which they are oppo&s;ite) to a very low Price, which has in a great mea&s;ure rui|ned the <HI>Manufactures</HI> in <HI>London, Norwich,</HI> and in divers other Places, as is ready more fully to be made appear.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> there is now gone to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> and <HI>China,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Loyd<HI>'s Li&s;t. Two Millions &s;ent to</HI> India.</NOTE> Fifty Ships, which are computed at near 400 Tuns <HI>per</HI> Ship, one with the other, and by a mode&s;t Computation are reckon|ed to have carried with them near <HI>Two Millions</HI> of Bullion, which is about Forty Thou|&s;and Pounds <HI>per</HI> Ship.</P>
<P>That all the&s;e Ships,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five Millions of Manufa|ctures to be brought in two Year, and an Half.</NOTE> or as great a number, are expected to make a Return in Two Years and an half, and their Cargo may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed and valued (when they return) at <HI>Six Million,</HI> it being common to make about Treble the Fir&s;t Co&s;t. And it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that Five Parts will be in Manufactures. And how far this may further dammage and ruine the Trade of this Kingdom, is &s;ubmitted to con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>Two Queries.</HEAD>
<P>If the increa&s;e of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> was judged Prejudicial,
<MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="Query"> and would <HI>inevitably</HI> &s;ink the value of the <HI>Lands</HI> in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ruin</HI> our Trade; becau&s;e the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> could under-work, and &s;o under-&s;ell us, as the <HI>Act</HI> for re&s;training that Trade &s;ets forth. Will not the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Manufactures</HI> do the &s;ame, and de&s;erve the Con&s;idera|tion of the Parliament,
<MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Query"> as well as the <HI>Iri&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>Whether the great Complaints made in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide. The E&s;|&s;ay upon the</HI> probable Me|thods of ma|king a People Gainers by Trade, <HI>p.</HI> 128.</NOTE> and other Foreign Parts of the decay of their Linnen Manufactures; and their &s;etting up Woollen Manufactures do not (as the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Ways and Means</HI> tell us) proceed from the expence of <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dia</HI> Linnens, which are here worn in their &s;tead; and whether their late Prohibition of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> do not proceed more from that Cau&s;e, than from the late <HI>Act</HI> made for the more effectual re&s;training the Importation of <HI>Flanders</HI> Lace??</P>
