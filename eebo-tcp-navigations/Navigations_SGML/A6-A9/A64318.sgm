<P><HI>_AMong Arts and Sciences Mathematical Gun|nery will not de&s;erve the lea&s;t re&s;pect which has been practi&s;ed for many years (as you may read in the fir&s;t Chapter of this Book where we treat of its Original) and from time to time Nece&s;&s;ity and Art together have produced many new Invention: &s;o that &s;ome may judge it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to add more unto this Art; and are ready to &s;ay of this as of other Studies,</HI> Nil dictum quod non dictum prius. <HI>But we have not only indeavoured the inqui&s;ition into the mo&s;t knowing Profe&s;&s;ors of the&s;e Arts both</HI> German, Italian, Frenchmen, Netherlander, <HI>&amp;c. from whence we have drawn the more Excellent and u&s;eful parts which were never before in our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Tongue; but may boldly ad|venture to call &s;ome things in it new: And finding the great Occa&s;ion which the&s;e pre&s;ent times do require in the knowledge of the&s;e things made me the readier to compo&s;e this Work, adjudging it a very great in|jury to our Country-men to be deprived of the knowledge of &s;uch things which are of &s;o great importance in this ve|ry juncture of time.

I have divided it into three Parts, endeavouring that it might be imperfect in nothing that is nece&s;&s;ary to this Art, or u&s;eful for a Gunner to know.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Treating of the Earth nece&s;&s;ary in making of Molds for the Ca&s;ting of Pieces of Ordnance, with the manner of Ca&s;ting,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_WE will not di&s;pute of the fir&s;t Invention of Guns, that is, whe|ther it came from <HI>Archimedes,</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> do report, or from an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> or from a <HI>Monk,</HI> for this knowledge matters not much to the Art, nor is it of any profitable &s;igni|fication to the Arti&s;t; e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that Authors do not really con&s;ent in this thing. Our intent is therefore not to trouble the ingenious Students with vain uncertain repeti|tions, but to compo&s;ea compleat Piece of Gunnery, and there|in to di&s;cour&s;e from the beginning to the end, all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be known or learned (after the knowledge of common Arithmetick) by one that intends to be a perfect Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">icient in the &s;aid Art. We do &s;uppo&s;e it therefore nece&s;&s;ary for a Ma|&s;ter Gunner to know fir&s;t the making of Molds and ca&s;ting of Pieces. Therefore I &s;hall fir&s;t begin to di&s;cour&s;e of the property and Nature of the Earth fit for ca&s;ting, or making Molds; for this is of great moment, con&s;idering that many, or indeed mo&s;t Earths are not for this purpo&s;e; for the Earth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t for the ca&s;ting of Pieces of Ordnance mu&s;t be &s;uch as will not be melted or fu&s;e, although it be put into a very great fire, but mu&s;t remain firm and hard: and the&s;e Earths are generally of a Red|di&s;h, or Iron-like colour, which is well known to many Potters, e&s;pecially &s;uch as make <HI>Chymical</HI> Ve&s;&s;els. The Earth being obtained, it mu&s;t be &s;ifted and ca&s;t up after the u&s;ual manner, as men do in the making of Morter; then let it be moi&s;tned with an Alchalated Water (e&s;pecially &s;uch as is made of Niter) for that purpo&s;e, and make it like pa&s;te; then, as is u&s;ual, let it be beaten up &s;trongly with an Iron Bar; the more 'tis beaten the better it is: in the beating add one &s;ixt part of Hor&s;e dung, and a proportionable part of Flox or Hair, and let it again be well beaten and incor|porated, alwayes keeping a Moity of this Earth without Hair or Flox, which is for Ground-work; and the&s;e Compo&s;itions or Earth thus incorporated, you mu&s;t re&s;erve for the making your Molds for Pieces of Ordnance, according to the Rules pre&s;cribed in the next Chapter.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of making Molds, and Ca&s;ting Pieces of Ordnance, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ture of Metals, and allowance of Powder for proof.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS a Ma&s;ter Builder when he intends the Building a Ship, makes fir&s;t a Mold or Moddel of the &s;ame; &s;o the Ma&s;ter Gunner, or he that takes in hand the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ca&s;ting Guns, mu&s;t have a form or Model of his Piece intended made of wood, or &s;uch other matter he may think mo&s;t convenient, which then being brought to the Founder with an intent to be Ca&s;t, mu&s;t fir&s;t be &s;meered all over with Palm Oyle, or in&s;tead of that, our Lard or Hogs-grea&s;e, then fir&s;t cover it over with the &s;aid earth thinly, and let it dry lei&s;urely, then lay on more, encrea&s;ing it to &s;uch a thickne&s;s, as you may judge convenient for your purpo&s;e; and it mu&s;t be &s;o made that it may be taken into &s;everal parts, &s;o that the pattern may be taken out, and the Mold again exactly clo&s;ed, and the out&s;ide &s;trengthned with Iron plates as long as the Chace of the Piece is, and hooped together with Iron hoops to knock on and off. Then mu&s;t there be made (with the &s;ame earth upon a &s;quare Bar of Iron, bound round with a Cord that the clay may &s;tick well) a form exactly round, of the fa&s;hion of the concave of your Piece (whether you intend it a Cylender or a Chamber|board Piece) proportioned both in length and diameter, and it mu&s;t be placed exact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in the middle of the concave; and when all is well joyned together, be &s;ure it be well polli&s;hed and &s;moothed, that the Metal may run the better, and be the clearer from flaws, holes, or clefts.</P>
<P>In the beginning of your work take care that your Mold be exactly propor|tionable as to heighth and &s;ub&s;tantialne&s;s of Metal, according to the nature of the Piece you intend. That is, the Canon double-fortified mu&s;t be &s;o ca&s;t that the Dia|meter at Muzzle be but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Diameter at Britch. The le&s;&s;er Cannon at Britch to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o big as the greater Cannon 9/16 at Trunions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> at Muzzle, whereas ordinary fortified Cannons have at the Touch-hole 7/8 at the Trunions 5/8 and at the Muzzle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, all le&s;&s;er Pieces in that kind have 18/1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the Touch-hole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> at Trunions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> at Muzzle; and the ordinary fortified Culverins are fortified every way like the double fortified Cannon, and the le&s;&s;er Culverin like the ordinary fortified Cannon in all re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Great care mu&s;t be taken in the Ca&s;ting of Pieces of Ordnance, that they be equal every way in proportion of Metals, that is, that the Cylender be in the very middle of the Metal, that it may be truely bored, otherwi&s;e your Piece will fail the Arti&s;t that &s;hall u&s;e it, until the error be known.</P>
<P>In the next place let the Trunions be exactly placed in a Diagonal line with the Axis of the Piece; and they may be placed in their proper di&s;tance from the Muzzle and Britch, if you ob&s;erve the&s;e Rules. Take the length of the bore of the Piece from Muzzle to Britch, divide that mea&s;ure by &s;even, and multiply that &s;um that cometh of the Quotient by three, the Product will &s;hew you how many inches the Trunions mu&s;t &s;tand from the lowe&s;t part of the concavity of the Piece.</P>
<P>And farther note, that the Trunions ought to be placed &s;o, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Circum|ference of the Piece, may be &s;een in that place where the Trunions are &s;et.</P>
<P>When all additional Patterns, as Britch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be made and Luted in their proper place, all things at plea&s;ure being neatly added to the pattern, let the Mold then be fixt or placed &s;o as is mo&s;t convenient for the pouring in the Metal; &s;o when
<PB N="3" REF="4"> the Metal is ca&s;t, the perfect impre&s;&s;ion will be made upon the &s;uperficial part of the Piece, and the Cylender will keep the bore propo&s;ed according to what you have pre&s;cribed, the length of the Piece and its Diameter of the bore may be found by the following Table in the next Chapter. For the Metals generally u&s;ed for tho&s;e Guns, generally called bra&s;s Guns, they are mixtures, and many times varied as experience will give leave. Some of the chiefe&s;t do approve of this mix|ture, that is, to every hundred Weight of Copper 24 pounds of Tin, and 6 pounds of Lattin. Others to <HI>100l.</HI> of Copper, add 8 <HI>l.</HI> of Tin, and 10 <HI>l.</HI> of Lattin. Others to ever <HI>100l.</HI> add <HI>20l.</HI> of Bell-Metal, which is <HI>25l.</HI> of Lead and Tin to every <HI>100l.</HI> of of Copper. Some add Tin, Lead, Copper, and <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> together; &s;o every one follows &s;uch wayes of Compo&s;ition as doth mo&s;t plea&s;e his own Experience. The Copper and other better Metals being once melted, the Tin and Lead is added for the better and quicker fu&s;ion; and the higher the Metal is in fu&s;ion, the more &s;olid and compact your Metal will run and &s;ettle. The Lattin doth incorporate and cau&s;e the Piece to be of a good colour, and the Tin doth &s;trengthen and bind the other matters together. Now a Piece of Ordnance being Ca&s;t, before it comes to Service, it mu&s;t be put to tryal; for which purpo&s;e there is u&s;ed for proof, according to the weight of the &s;hot, about two thirds, or four fifths of that weight in Powder, and for &s;maller Pieces more.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="6"> the greatne&s;s of the weight. For &s;ometimes it may be nece&s;&s;ary to put planks or &s;ome &s;olid thing under the Ghynne and Pins to &s;tay them; but this as nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall require.</P>
<P>Now the Ghynne firmly placed and &s;etled, the Gunner mu&s;t get up by the Ladder, or &s;ome Steps, to the head or top of it, having the Rope in his hand, &s;hall put it through the uppermo&s;t truckle of the head, and let it fall down to another man again, that he may catch it, that he may put it through one &s;ide of the Piece to fa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">en it into the Ears of the Piece, and &s;o having put it through them he may draw it up, until he can give it him that is above, and then put it through the other hole of the Truckle, and give it to him that is under him, who mu&s;t reach it again to him that is above, and &s;o fa&s;ten it to the head of the Ghynne, giving it &s;ome turns until it come under the uppermo&s;t Truckle.</P>
<P>This done, he mu&s;t fa&s;ten it with great diligence to the lower Truckle, by putting the Ears as through the Ring which is under the &s;aid Truckle; after this begin to Hoy&s;e your Peice, and in the Hoy&s;ing put a &s;par or &s;ome &s;uch thing into the mouth of the Peice, &s;o that thereby it may be governed, and may not &s;way from one &s;ide to the other, which would be dangerous; for if it &s;hould &s;trike again&s;t the Rouler or any one of the feet of the Gynne, it may break all, and &s;o &s;poil both the work and the men tending upon it. Therefore I &s;ay, be &s;ure that tho&s;e who &s;tand by the Spar be careful in guiding the Piece and keeping it &s;teddy and right, until the weight of the Piece is well &s;etled, a diligent Eye being had all this while, that nei|ther the feet of the Gynne, nor Rope give way; and be &s;ure every part of the Rope draw equal, and that there be no Knicks, or that they be not tangled one among&s;t another; and for that purpo&s;e, when they begin to hoy&s;e the Piece, blows mu&s;t be given upon the Tackling until it be &s;et tort, and all bear equal.</P>
<P>But if you &s;hould perceive that the Ghynne or any part give way, pre&s;ently let your Piece &s;ink, and underlay and &s;ettle well the feet of the Ghynne, and that as gently as may be, to the end the Cro&s;s beam or Rouler may not be disjoyned or broken.</P>
<P>Then wind it up carefully and very gently by the help of two men onely, and in &s;uch a manner, as when one of the Leavers is brought down, it mu&s;t be held there fa&s;t until the other has got purcha&s;e, and then mu&s;t this other al&s;o be brought down; this mu&s;t be reiterated &s;o often until it be &s;o high that the Carriage may be placed under it, &s;o that the Trunions may fall into the Sockets, or holes of the Carriage, and then Guide the Piece by the Spar, &s;o that it fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l ea&s;ily in, and &s;o re&s;t it &s;elf in the Carriage, and then let it be well cla&s;ped over, and then locked in and fa&s;tned with Forelocks, and &s;o you may draw away your Piece where you plea&s;e.

<P>Many times when Hor&s;es are wanting, men are made u&s;e of: Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, you mu&s;t divide your men into three drawing files, according to the greatne&s;s of the Piece; now to the end the Ranks may &s;pread, and every man may draw equally alike, fa&s;ten to the end of the Carriage a Cro&s;s beam or bar, to which you mu&s;t fa&s;ten the drawing Ropes, equally at &s;uch di&s;tance, that one may not impead the other, and let there be be&s;ure one to &s;teer the Piece when you come to any winding or turn|ing. If the drawing Ropes be long, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s it with Ropes, or &s;ome light peeces of wood like a Ladder, with two or more cro&s;s peeces; let them be made fa&s;t for the better and more &s;teady drawing, and to every there mu&s;t be a Neck|line fa&s;tned to the Ropes, and &s;o to ca&s;t over every mans Sholders, in manner as is u&s;ed to draw our We&s;tern Barges: And you mu&s;t know your proportion of men fit to draw any Piece of Ordnance, and that mu&s;t be regulated according to the good|ne&s;s or badne&s;s of the way, and &s;o more or le&s;s men, allowing every man to draw about 50, 60, or 80 pounds; for 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed a man may draw in ordinary way 50 or 60 pounds but in very good way more than 80 pounds, however 'tis good to have men enough. Let the Spunge, Ladle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be made fa&s;t along the Piece to the Ring and Britch end.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT remains nece&s;&s;ary for this Chapter to treat, or &s;hew the way to know, whether a Piece be &s;erviceable or no, which is u&s;ually done in the fir&s;t proof by Powder, which we intend not to Write of here, having mentioned it before, and more will be &s;aid, when we have &s;hewed the compo&s;ition of Powder. That knowledge of a Piece we here intend, is to examine a Piece, bought, or to be taken into Service, whether good or &s;erviceable, or out of many Pieces to make choice of the be&s;t, or &s;uch as are freed from holes, flaws, cracks, honycombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And fir&s;t to know if a Piece be free from crack, or have holes through, take a long &s;tick, longer than the Piece, made of a Hoop-&s;tick or otherwi&s;e, &s;lit it at one end, &s;o that you may put a &s;hort peece of Candle in it, then light the Candle, and put it into the Piece, and &s;o putting it along ea&s;ily, whil&s;t another laying his Eye clo&s;e to the Piece, do go along equally with the Candle, until the whole Piece be viewed, and &s;o by help of the Light within &s;ide, the Eye without &s;ide will perceive whether there be any Flaws, Cracks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This may be done by the reflection of the Sun beams in at the Muzzle of a Piece, by help of a Looking-gla&s;s, or polli&s;hed Steel; but many times a Piece may be Flawed or Hony-combed, and cannot be di&s;cerned through the Piece, and then the be&s;t way to find them out is thus; make the u&s;ual &s;earch with two or three Springs, or in ca&s;e you have them not, bend the Iron point of a Half Pike, then put it into the Piece up to the Britch end or bottom of the Cylinder, turning it round carefully and gradually, as you pluck it out, and if there be any Honey-combs, Cracks or Flawes, the end or bended point of the Half Pike wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tick or catch at them.</P>
<P>To know whether the Piece be Chamber-bor'd, take a priming Iron that is &s;mall, or a piece of Wire, bend it a little at the end, but &s;o that it may go down at the Touch-hole, and put it down &s;o far as it will go; Then at the Touch-hole clo&s;e by the Metal of the Piece, make a mark upon the Wire; then gently pluck it up upon one &s;ide of the Touch-hole, until the bended point &s;top upon the Metal or upper &s;ide of the Chamber; and then make another mark upon the Wyer, ju&s;t by the Touch|hole;
<PB N="9" REF="7"> then draw out the Wyer, and the di&s;tance between the&s;e two marks, is the height of the Chamber or bore of the Piece at Britch: take the height of the bore at Muzzle, and if this height at Muzzle agree with that taken at the Britch of the Piece, then is the Piece full bored; but if they differ, &s;o much as the difference is, &s;heweth the tapering of the Piece, and according to this mu&s;t your former be made for your Cartredges. There is another way to know whether a Piece be Chamber|bor'd, or Tapering by the di&s;parting of a Piece; which way we &s;hall &s;hew in its proper place, where we treat of di&s;parting a Piece of Ordnance.</P>
<P>Now although we have mentioned in the former Chapters the mo&s;t u&s;ual Pieces of Ordnance; yet, as I have &s;aid, there are other Pieces which are longer, or &s;horter, which are u&s;ed, and are generally called by the name of Ba&s;tard Pieces, and they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common Legitimate Pieces thus; The Legitimate Pieces have their due length of Chance, and are proportioned according to the true height of their bore. Ba&s;tard Pieces are &s;horter Cha&s;es, &s;uch as the proportion of their bore doth require, and are therefore called Cuts of the &s;ame nature of the Piece they agree with in the bore; as tho&s;e of Demi-Culverin bore, are called Demi-Culverin Cuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are al&s;o Pieces called Extraordinary, which are &s;uch who&s;e Chaces are longer than is u&s;ually for that bore.</P>
<P>Now we have well and duely under&s;tood how, not only to make, but al&s;o to exa|mine and prove a Piece of Ordnance, in the next place &s;hall follow their u&s;e, &s;et down in due order: Wherein fir&s;t 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for us to treat of the nature of Gun|powder, and its various Compo&s;itions, with the Materials nece&s;&s;ary thereunto, and afterward &s;hew its u&s;e.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Materials u&s;ed in the Compo&s;ition of Gun|powder; and fir&s;t we will treat of the Original of Salt-Peter.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is believed by many in the&s;e latter times, that the Salt-Peter now in u&s;e, is not the Niter of the Ancients, but a new Invention u&s;ed or found out for the Com|po&s;ition of Powder; And that theirs was only a Niter generated by nature, or that Salt that is coagulated of it &s;elf, without any humane Artifice, in the Caverns of the Earth, from whence they took it which neverthele&s;s they divide into four different Species, to wit, <HI>Armenian, Affrican, Roman,</HI> and <HI>Egyptian;</HI> and this <HI>Egyptian</HI> holds its name by a certain Region in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in which is found great abundance. <HI>Serapian</HI> delivers to us, that the places from whence they drew their Niter were all one and the &s;ame, like them where common Salt is formed, in which the water running doth congeal, and conden&s;eth like a vulgar Stone, from hence came it to be called &s;tonified Salt, or Sal-Peter. The &s;ame Author doth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">irm, that Niter was found of divers colours, <HI>viz.</HI> White, Reddi&s;h, Livid, or Lead-like, and all other colours it was able to take; he &s;aith likewi&s;e that it was found in different forms; for &s;ome was found full of holes or caverns like a Spunge; others on the contrary were firm, clo&s;e, &s;ollid, &s;hining, and Diaphanous as Gla&s;s, which being let fall ea&s;ily will &s;plit in thin leaves, and is fryable in beating; and from its various appearances is judged its manifold vertues, in one more powerful than another, which is known by its operation.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>From hence we &s;ee that which is to be found from the te&s;timony of the be&s;t received Authors about the Mineral Niter, and in none is any mention made of Artificial Salt-Peter, or &s;uch as we at pre&s;ent make u&s;e of generally, which is called properly <HI>Salt-Peter, Sal Nitre,</HI> or <HI>Halinitre;</HI> yet is there very little difference between the Natural that u&s;eth to be brought to us, and the Artificial; for if we compare the vertues and operations of the one, we &s;hall find them in our u&s;es no way d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ffering, as <HI>Scaliger</HI> te&s;tifies, &s;aying that the ancient Niter is not much different from ours, particularly if we con&s;ider its tenuity and &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">il part.</P>
<P>There is of the ancient Niter found upon the &s;uperficies of old Walls, expo&s;ed to the humidity; but particularly in Cellars and deep Caves, and in covered Vaults; it re&s;embles perfectly a certain Brine, or white Gelly, or fine Meal, or in more proper &s;peaking, fine Sugar, and is many times white as Snow; and this thus had, the vertues are to be commended, which I my &s;elf have taken the pains to collect, in the imitation of many others which I have often &s;een; which if now it be de&s;ired to prepare this Salt according to the method of our Art; It will be congealed into &s;mall little long Chri&s;tals like I&s;icles, and it will be like that of the Ancients. But as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to find &s;o great a quantity, as the continual u&s;e doth con&s;ume, and nece&s;&s;ity doth excite to this day for the &s;upply of all Wars, which have been great, and in few years con&s;umed many great and va&s;t places of the Univer&s;e: We are therefore con&s;trained to this new &s;ubject, and are forced even to &s;tudy and invent in the&s;e latter ages a new way to &s;upply the want of the former, which being made with much labour and indu&s;try from the bowels of the Earth, and then purified and wa&s;hed divers times to &s;eparate it from its more gro&s;s and Terre&s;trial parts, and taken from its fir&s;t crudity, that its may &s;hew its likene&s;s of its Mother, it is in the end perfectly purified and brought to &s;uch a height, that it differs nothing to he of the &s;ame form and vertue of the ancient Salt-Peter.</P>
<P>Wherefore if I may be admitted to &s;peak my thoughts upon it, I &s;hall &s;ay openly and plainly, leaving none in doubt, the Ancients did indeed find natural growing Niter, which came out of it &s;elf at the tops of Rocks, filling the clefts and holes, and there conden&s;ing into &s;mall Icicles, it hardnes and petrefies. This Niter is natural; but &s;ince Art is the Imitator of Nature, as 'tis allowed by all, then you may not think it &s;trange, if we can by a little of her aid, and by force of indu&s;try, attain to the perfection of her productions; nay, (if I may be bold to &s;ay it) &s;uch as &s;hall &s;urpa&s;s by far, the more perfect of her works. Do we not daily &s;ee an infinite of very principal Works brought to light, after a long and painful travel, which is not per|mitted nature to imitate, although &s;he did imploy at the be&s;t all her &s;ecret and full &s;trength to come to perfection. It may from hence &punc;herefore be concluded that our Salt made by the Art of Fire, is &s;uch as is every way agreeing with that of the Ancients, not any way differing one from the other; e&s;pecially as to tho&s;e u&s;es we intend here. For if according to our method given in the next Chapter, I dare affirm, in all our u&s;es it will truely imitate the natural, but the more, if it be purified and purged many times: So that at la&s;t it will come to be more excellent than the An|cient and natural Salt-Peter; which is plainly &s;een in the ordinary way of purifying Common Salt or Sugar, which by Art is &s;o purged, that it comes to be far purer and whiter than 'twas before, in its fir&s;t natural dre&s;s. And this we do &s;uppo&s;e to be a &s;ufficient argument, or rea&s;on, for us to judge that our Artificial Salt-Peter is not only as good, but far more excellent than the natural: Which being thus allowed, we will add only a few words of the properties of Niter, and &s;o pa&s;s to its Artificial preparation. And fir&s;t of the &s;petting quality and noi&s;e it makes in the fire, which <HI>Scaliger</HI> would have to be cau&s;ed by its terre&s;trity that it holds in it &s;elf, which we cannot allow of, but rather judge otherwi&s;e; for if the Earthy part were the &s;ubject that made it make &s;uch noi&s;e, then the Earth it &s;elf might be adjudged to make a far greater noi&s;e, &s;eeing it is al&s;o mixed with this Element, and yet we find it cracks not at all, being put in the fire; therefore by con&s;equence this rea&s;on is void. Well then, is it of its rarity, which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, This cannot pa&s;s for a truth, &s;ince daily experience doth let us &s;ee that the Mu&s;hrooms,

There mu&s;t therefore be another thing that mu&s;t be the cau&s;e of this &s;petting, and all the noi&s;e that is made by Nitre, when it is embraced by the fire. The Divine <HI>Praeceptor,</HI> in the 11 Section of his Que&s;tions &s;aith, that the Salt cracks in the fire, becau&s;e it contains in it much moi&s;ture, which being attenuated by the fire, and rarified in a high degree, con|verts all into Spirits, and an Airy nature; For in it there is contained more of a Spirit, than watery matter, which being brought to the fire, the two fiery Spi|rits mutually attract each other, and joyning together, do become Ma&s;ter of the le&s;&s;er part the Water; for the fire of the Niter being fortified and put into action by the common fire, the Water is con&s;trained from its bonds, and can &s;tay no longer there, but mu&s;t of a &s;uddain depart, and in its way, by the violency of its departure, overthroweth all &s;uch ob&s;tacles as come in its way: And in this action the external air being &s;trongly and violently agitated, by their refraction, it breaks with impetuo&s;ity or great violence, and from thence by con&s;equence follows that hideous and fearful noi&s;e which commonly and ordinarily happens, in the com|bu&s;tion of Salt-Peter, and other Compo&s;itions mixed with it, whereof Salt-Peter is the greate&s;t part.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t is, that &s;uch Earth as you &s;u&s;pect to hold Salt-Peter, be put upon the Tongue, and if it prick a little &s;harply, it is a mo&s;t certain &s;ign you will not loo&s;e your labour in taking it to task; but on the contrary if it be not biting, or a little corro&s;ive, it will not well an&s;wer your money and labour in preparing of it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way to know a good Nitrous Earth is this: make a hole in the Earth with a &s;harp pointed thing, either of Wood or Iron&punc; and in it put a peece of Iron red hot; after having &s;topt the hole, let it &s;tand until it be quite cold, then draw it out, and if you find a little after about this Iron &s;ome Citrine marks, inclining a little after to a whitene&s;s, you need not doubt that earth; but further a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf 'tis very good to put to work.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="9">
<P>The third way is, throw a little of that Earth upon burning Coals, and if you perceive it make any noi&s;e, and that it &s;pets in the fire, or that clear and &s;hining &s;parks come from it, you may from thence judge that that Earth holds a forcible matter of that nature.</P>
<P>After you have found a proper Earth to draw Salt-Peter from, and that by &s;ome of the&s;e proofs you have te&s;timony of its goodne&s;s and worth, let be taken of it a great quantity, or as much as you plea&s;e; let it be carried to a place appointed for this purpo&s;e, then prepare to burn a good quantity of Wood, either of Oak, A&s;h, Elm, Maple, or other &s;orts of hard Wood, that you may have A&s;hes; then take two parts of the&s;e A&s;hes, one part of quick Lime, mix them well, and put this mixture by it &s;elf; for &s;uch u&s;es as I &s;hall &s;hew you anon.</P>
<P>Take then Ve&s;&s;els of Wood, or Pipes, or Hog&s;heads cut in two parts, for they mu&s;t be able to hold a good quantity of Water, make a hole at the bottom about one or two fingers breadth, put into the hole a &s;mall wicker thing, or you may whelm over it an Earthen Di&s;h, after put Ru&s;hes all over the bottom (not excepting the hole) or in its place clean &s;traw; this Ve&s;&s;el being thus fitted, di&s;po&s;e of it in this manner; Set it &s;o, that under may &s;tand a le&s;&s;er Ve&s;&s;el of Wood to receive the Li|quor that &s;hall di&s;til down from the upper Ve&s;&s;el; after put into the upper Ve&s;&s;el about the height of a hand of this Salt-Peter Earth, which has been before for &s;ome time dryed in the Air; upon this Earth put the height of three or four fingers of the mixture made of A&s;hes and quick Lime, and then again of the Salt-Peter Earth, after of the A&s;hes about the &s;ame height as before; and continue this fa&s;hion, putting Earth upon A&s;hes, and A&s;hes upon Earth, until the Ve&s;&s;el be full within a hands breadth at the top, to hold the Water that is put in; this done put upon it fre&s;h Water as much as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;o much as mu&s;t &s;urmount the Earth two or three fingers breadth, and look that it pa&s;s through all the Earth, and run drop by drop through the hole at bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el into the Tub &s;tanding under, and you &s;hall have a Nitrous <HI>Lixivium,</HI> according to the quantity of Water as you poured into the Ve&s;&s;el; which if you judge is too little, you mu&s;t reiterate the infu&s;ion, and the &s;econd time al&s;o the water pa&s;&s;ing through the Earth will carry with it a &s;ub|&s;tance; And &s;o the third time.</P>
<P>This done, put all the <HI>Lixivium</HI> into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ettle of a &s;ufficient bigne&s;s, and let it be boyled upon the fire very ea&s;ily, and moderately at fir&s;t; after increa&s;e the fire to the con&s;umption of the Liquor, or a little more, keeping continually skimming it all the time it boyls. And when 'tis thus con&s;umed, pour it into wooden Ve&s;&s;els that are broad, and cover them over with Cloaths, and let them &s;tand until the pure part Chri&s;talize into white Salt, and the feculent or more terre&s;tial part &s;ettle to the bottom. In the mean time continue pouring in of the <HI>Lixivium</HI> again into the Kettle, boyling and skimming it as before; and this do until all your <HI>Lixivium</HI> be boyled up and poured into wooden Ve&s;&s;els to Chri&s;talize.</P>
<P>Then from the wooden Ve&s;&s;els, inclining them gently, pour all the <HI>Lixivium</HI> (leav|ing the &s;ettling at bottom by it &s;elf) into your Copper as before, and boyl it up again with a good fire until half be con&s;umed, or until it begin to thicken, or until by putting a little upon a &s;tone or peece of board, it do immediately congeal.</P>
<P>Then take it from the fire, and when 'tis a little cooled, pour it as before into wooden Ve&s;&s;els or Boles, and put into each about a hand in height; then cover each Ve&s;&s;el with cour&s;e cloaths, put it into a cool place, and two or three dayes after you will find your Salt-Peter congealed and thru&s;t together in &s;mall Chri&s;tals, like tran&s;parent Ice, &s;ticking to the &s;ides of the Ve&s;&s;el, and likewi&s;e upon &s;ome &s;ticks for that purpo&s;e, provided the rinds being taken off and placed in the wooden Ve&s;&s;els be|fore the pouring in of the Liquor; get diligently together the Peter, as well that which &s;ticks to the &s;ides of the Ve&s;&s;el, as that to the &s;ticks, in a Ve&s;&s;el of wood proper to receive it, and cover it, and keep it dry. The remaining water you mu&s;t boyl up as before, not forgetting to &s;eparate it from its re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t 'tis boyling, it happens &s;ometimes that the Liquor may ri&s;e and boyl over the Cauldron; to prevent that danger, have in readine&s;s other <HI>Lixivium,</HI> made
<PB N="13" REF="9"> of three parts of A&s;hes, and one part of quick Lyme, as we &s;poke before, in which is di&s;&s;olved <HI>Roch Allum,</HI> allowing to every hundred weight of <HI>Lixivium,</HI> four pounds of Allum; and when it begins to ri&s;e, pour in a little of this from time to time; And by this means you will &s;ee that the water that was ha&s;tning to come over, will fall down; and that the common Salt and more terre&s;trial part will &s;ettle to the bottom.</P>
<P>The Earth remaining in the Wooden Tubs from whence the &s;alt was drawn, mu&s;t be put in &s;ome cover'd place made for that purpo&s;e, where neither Sun, Rain, nor any other water may come; and there it mu&s;t be &s;pread all abroad about a foot high: Then you mu&s;t have in readine&s;s Hor&s;e dung or the Excrements of all &s;orts of Bea&s;ts, great and &s;mall, and put off this upon the other, about the height of three or four foot; then take all that was skum'd from the <HI>Lixivium</HI> in boyling, and the water that is left and will not &s;hoot, and the bottoms that are left in the wooden Ve&s;&s;el, where the Salt-Peter did &s;hoot, and throw them away, as hurtful and u&s;ele&s;s, upon the Dung|hil; throw likewi&s;e every day, or as often as you can, the Urine of men, and let it lye two years, and you &s;hall have your Earth filled with Salt-Peter as before, with a greater aboundance: You may likewi&s;e throw upon your Dunghill, the Horns, Claws, and Hoofs of Bea&s;t, and then from this Earth it will be very ea&s;ie to draw good Salt-Peter by the method we have pre&s;cribed.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How to clarifie common Sulphur, and to know its goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE experience often, and without contradiction, that not only Salt-Peter is filled with terre&s;trial qualities, but Brim&s;tone al&s;o, which is not only of a fat|ty &amp; certain oleganious humour, but likewi&s;e a noy&s;ome quality which is in the com|pound, common to one and the other of its matters; from hence (if we de&s;ire to be curious in our work) we judge it may be nece&s;&s;ary to purifie Sulphur, and to procure to it by power of clarification, a nature mo&s;t &s;ublime, &s;ubtile, fiery and volatile. The order and method that ought to be u&s;ed in this, is thus; in Ve&s;&s;els of Iron or Copper, melt your Sulphur with a very gentle fire over Coals, well lighted, and not flaming; and when it is melted with a Ladle, skim neatly off all that ri&s;eth on the top and &s;wimmeth upon the Sulphur; then not long after, let it be taken from the fire, and &s;trained through a double Linnen Cloath into another Ve&s;&s;el, pouring it through at lei&s;ure; thus all the Oylie matter and cra&s;&s;y &s;ub&s;tance remains in the Cloath; but under in the Ve&s;&s;el will be a pure Sulphur, &s;uch as we have before &s;poken of.</P>
<P>To know the goodne&s;s of Sulphur you mu&s;t do thus: Pre&s;s it between two Iron plates, that are hot, and if in the running it appear yellow, without any bad odour, and that which remains be of a reddi&s;h colour, one may believe 'tis natural and excellent; &s;o likewi&s;e 'tis a good &s;ign, if when 'tis &s;et on fire, it do freely burn all away, leaving little or no re&s;ident matter. For if Sulphur be pure and good, we do find that there is &s;uch a &s;ympathy between it and fire, that the fire is de&s;irous of the Sulphur for its nutriment, and that reciprocally the Sulphur is plea&s;ed like|wi&s;e to be thus devoured and con&s;umed by the Element of fire; &s;o that if &s;ome fragment of it be put about &s;ome pieces of Wood, if this &s;hall feel the fire at &s;ome di&s;tance, it &s;eems as if it did attract it to it &s;elf, and doth &s;ometimes unawares at a di&s;tance catch or take fire, if great care be not taken.</P>
<P>There is a certain kind of Sulphur which will not burn &s;o freely as other Sulphur, nor &s;end forth any ill &s;cent, but being put upon the fire, melts no otherwi&s;e than common Wax; and this Sulphur is found abundantly near Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> as <HI>Carniola</HI> of <HI>Libavius</HI> reports, in his fir&s;t Book of the <HI>Apocap. Hermel.</HI> but this Sul|phur is commonly red, as al&s;o is that which is found in the <HI>Heil des Heim</HI> (as <HI>Agricola</HI> mentions in his fir&s;t Book, <HI>Chap.</HI> 22.) And upon the te&s;timony of <HI>Iohn Iohn|&s;on, Adm. Nat. Cla&s;. 4. Chap.</HI> 13. Sulphur is found likewi&s;e of divers other colours, as pale, Yellow, Green, as is many times to be &s;een and found &s;ticking about Stones and Rocks: So, that a man may, without any great difficulty, take it from thence, and make it into a Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>That which is clear, perfectly yellow, not very hard, nor too much &s;hining, is the very be&s;t. Yet there is another Sulphur which looks greeni&s;h, and hath never pa&s;t the fire; and this is called <HI>Sulphur Vivum,</HI> and by &s;ome <HI>Virgin Sulphur,</HI> by rea&s;on Women and Maids had a cu&s;tom to compo&s;e with it a certain <HI>fucus</HI> or Paint, with which they u&s;ed to adorn their faces.</P>

For I have &s;een many of the People of <HI>Podolie,</HI> and <HI>&V;krains,</HI> which we call now the <HI>Co&s;&s;aques,</HI> who pre|pare their Powder quite contrary to the common way, or that which is u&s;ed by Fire-Ma&s;ters. For they put Sulphur, Salt-Peter, Charcoal, all together in an Earthen Pot, a certain proportion of each; (which proportion one to the other they have learned by experimental practice) upon which they pour fair fre&s;h water, which they boyl upon the fire until all the water is evaporated, and the matter become thick; then
<PB N="18" REF="12"> they take it from the fire, and dry it in the Sun, or in &s;ome warm place, as a Stove, or the like; then they pa&s;s it through a Hair Sieve, and reduce it into &s;mall Grains. There are others that take the&s;e Materials, and grind them upon a &s;mooth flat Stone, or a &s;mooth Earthen Di&s;h, and then having moi&s;tned it, by their Skill they bring it into Grains; which powder brought to this degree of perfection, they &s;erve their occa&s;ions with as much utillity and profit, as if it had been made by the hand of one of the mo&s;t knowing or skilful Powder-makers in the world.</P>

<P>You mu&s;t fir&s;t finely powder the&s;e compo&s;itions or mixtures, for Cannon or Mu&s;quet Powder, and after moi&s;&s;en them with fair fre&s;h water or Vinegar, or with <HI>Aquavitae;</HI> but if you will have your Pi&s;tol Powder &s;tronger and more violent, you ought to &s;tir it up &s;everal times whil&s;t tis in the Morter, with this following liquor; that is, a water di&s;tilled from Rinds of Oranges, Citrons, or Lemons, by an Alymbeck, or any other Chymical Ve&s;&s;el; then let all be beaten and well brayed 24. hours, and then in the end reduce it into very fine &s;mall grains.</P>
<P>A Liquor for this purpo&s;e may likewi&s;e be made of twenty parts of <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and 12 parts of di&s;tilled Vinegar made of Whitewine, and four parts of Spirit of Salt-Peter, and two parts of water of Sal-armoniac, and one part of Camphire di&s;|&s;olved in Brandy-wine, or reduced into Powder with powdered Sulphur, or redu|ced with Oyl of &s;weet Almonds.</P>
<P>To Corn Powder well, you mu&s;t prepare a Sieve with a bottom of thick Parchment, made full of round holes; then moi&s;ten the Powder that mu&s;t be corned with its water, and make it up in Balls as big as Eggs; which put into the Sieve, and with it put a wooden Bowls, and when you have &s;o done, &s;ift the Powder &s;o, as the Bowl rouling about the Sieve, may break the Clods of Powder, and make it pa&s;s through tho&s;e little holes into Corns.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by Fire-Ma&s;ters and Gunners, that Powder when it is Corned, is of much greater force and power, than in Meal; from hence 'tis concluded, that powder when 'tis put into a Piece of Ordnance, ought not to be pre&s;&s;ed or beaten home too hard in the Piece; for thereby it will loo&s;e its form of grains, and thereby loo&s;eth a great part of its &s;trength that it had, and is therefore not able to throw out the Bullet with &s;o great a violence, as if the Powder had been gently thru&s;t home to the Britchend.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>KNow fir&s;t that all the blackne&s;s which you &s;ee in Gun-powder comes from the Coal; not that this colour is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be conjoyned to its nature, or that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be given to it, for its meliorating or making it more vigorous; this is not &s;o; but by contraryes you may be permitted to give unto it any &s;uch colours as you &s;hall think fit, without prejudice or hinderance of the Pow|der and vertue of it. For if in&s;tead of Coal you take rotten dryed wood, or Sawdu&s;t well dryed, or white paper moi&s;tned and dryed in a Stove and powdered, or indeed any other thing of a combu&s;tible nature, or that is well di&s;po&s;ed to take fire (&s;uch as you read hereunder) and to this you may add a colour according to your fancie and plea&s;ure; and you will infallibly have a Powder that will make the &s;ame Effect as the black powder.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Proof or Tryal of Gun-powder.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is accu&s;tomary for men skilled in the&s;e Arts, to try Powder three &s;everal wayes; that is, by &s;ight, by touch, and by fire: And fir&s;t, for the tryal by &s;ight; it is thus,</P>
<P>If the Powder be too black, it is a manife&s;t &s;ign of too much humidity, or too much coal; now if it contain too much, as you &s;uppo&s;e, rub it upon white Paper; if it black the Paper more than other good Powder u&s;e to do, it is a &s;ign there is more coal in it than ought: for &s;uch Gun-Powder as is of a fair azure colour, or a little ob&s;cure, &s;omthing bordering upon red, is the be&s;t &s;ign, and the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured te&s;timony of good Powder.</P>
<P>Secondly, Gun-Powder its goodne&s;s is known by the touch, in this manner, cru&s;h &s;ome Corns under your fingers ends, and if they ea&s;ily break and return to Meal with|out re&s;i&s;ting the touch, or without feeling hard, you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf from thence, that your Powder hath in it too much Coal.</P>
<P>If by pre&s;&s;ing it a little hard under your fingers upon a &s;mooth hard board, or upon a &s;tone, you feel among&s;t it &s;mall grains harder or more &s;ollid than the re&s;t, which do in a manner prick the ends of the fingers, and do not yield to the finger but very difficultly, or hardly, you may infer from hence that the Sulphur is not well incorporated with the Salt-Peter, and by con&s;equence the Powder is not well and duely prepared.</P>
<P>You may draw infallible proofs or conjectures of the goodne&s;s of Powder by its burning, if after you have made little heaps of Powder upon a clean and even Table, di&s;tant one from another about a hands breadth, you then put fire to one of them only; and if it take fire alone, and burn all away without lighting the others, and make a &s;mall thundring noi&s;e, or make a white clear &s;moak, and that it ri&s;e with a quickne&s;s, &s;uddainly, almo&s;t imperceptible, and if it ri&s;e in the Air like a circle of &s;moak, or like a &s;mall Crown; this is an infallible &s;ign the Powder is good, and perfectly well prepared.</P>
<P>If after the burning of the Powder there remain &s;ome black marks upon the Table, this then &s;ignifies that the Powder contains too much Coal, which has not been enough burnt.</P>
<P>If the board looks grea&s;ie, then the Sulphur and Salt-Peter is not enough clean&s;ed, and by con&s;equence it retains much of their terre&s;trial matter and oyly natures which were naturally conjoyned to their matters. If you find &s;mall grains, white and Citrine, it is a te&s;timony that the Salt-Peter is not enough clean&s;ed, and by con&s;equence it
<PB N="22" REF="14"> retains much of its terre&s;trial matter, and of common Salt, and be&s;ides, the Sulphur hath not been well powdered, nor &s;ufficiently incorporated with the two other matters of its Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If two or three Corns of Gun-Powder be laid upon a Paper, di&s;tant about a fin|gers bredth one from the other, and you put fire to them, if the fire be good and &s;trong, they will fire at once, and there will remain no gro&s;sne&s;s of Brim&s;tone, or of Salt-Peter, nor any thing but a white &s;moaky colour in the place where they were burnt, nor will the Paper be touched. If &s;mall black knots, which will burn downward in the place where proof is made, remain after firing, they do &s;hew that the Gun-powder hath no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> enough of Peter, and that it is of little force or &s;trength.</P>
<P>Good Gun-Powder will not burn your hand, if it be &s;et on fire there.</P>
<P>Gun-Powder that is very &s;harp or eager in ta&s;t, is not well purified, and will turn moi&s;t.</P>
<P>Among&s;t many &s;orts of Powder, to know the be&s;t, make a little heap of every &s;ort at a di&s;tance one from another; ob&s;erving well when you fire each heap, which of them doth &s;oone&s;t take fire, for that which &s;oone&s;t takes fire, &s;moaks lea&s;t and cleare&s;t, and ri&s;eth quickly up clo&s;e and round, and leaves little or no &s;ign behind it, is the be&s;t Powder.</P>
<P>There are In&s;truments likewi&s;e invented for the tryal or proof of Powder, which the mo&s;t part of Fire-Ma&s;ters and Gunners are accu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">omed to u&s;e, which are de&s;cribed at large by other Authors; therefore we &s;hall not here repeat the &s;ame; con|&s;idering likewi&s;e, that we have found by experience a great fallacy in the &s;ame, for that one and the &s;ame Powder, in the &s;ame mea&s;ure and quantities, hath rai&s;ed the cover to different degrees of height.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>VVE call &s;uch Gun-Powder weak, which hath much degenerated from its fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;trength, and the force which it did acquire in its fir&s;t preparation; as &s;uch as hath dak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n wind, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, or air; for the&s;e do dimini&s;h the quantity of Salt-Peter, and actually &s;eparate the Sulphur and Coal.</P>
<P>There are two different wayes that the&s;e accidents do happen; that is, by being many years made, or lying in a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t place long; for in time the Salt-Peter alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;eparates it &s;elf, being naturally &s;ubject to alter, and return into its fir&s;t matter; for Salt-Peter in its beginning or original being engendered of water, or of a certain Saline bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">our, no otherwi&s;e than other Salts are produced of their own proper Brines, doth at la&s;t, or in a long time, &s;eparate it &s;elf from the Coal and Sulphur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> and &s;o return to a Brine water again, as it was in the original, and &s;o aban|do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> two matters that adhered to it&punc; the Sulphur and Coals loo&s;ing no|thing of their weight, &s;eeing that no humidity that is attracted, can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e able to di&s;&s;olve them&punc; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">her by the contrary, the Coal doth attract greed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, and becomes more ponderous.</P>
<P>If for the rea&s;ons afore &s;aid you de&s;ire to repair and re&s;tore the &s;trength of Gun-Powder that begins to alter, or that hath quite lo&s;t its force, its defects may be amended three &s;everal wayes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> viz.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14">
<P>The fir&s;t is thus, make a Lye of two parts of <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and one part of clarified Salt-Peter made into fine Powder, of good Vinegar made of good Wine half a part, of Oyl of Sulphur one eighth part, and as much Camphire di&s;&s;olved in Brandy; the&s;e put together, do make a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> which mu&s;t be &s;trained through a large Strainer, and then with it you may amend your powder that is decayed, by moi&s;t|ning it with the &s;ame, very often, and drying it by the Sun in Wooden Ve&s;&s;els, and then putting it up in a dry place, free from any humidity or air, and then it will not in a long time again be damnified.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way to repair Powder is thus, examine how much your Powder weighed when it was fir&s;t put into the Cask or Barrel, then &s;ee how much it doth now weigh after 'tis damnified (it being fir&s;t dryed if it chance to be wet) then &s;ee the difference between the&s;e two weights, and add &s;o much Salt-Peter to your decayed powder, mix it well, and make it up into Corns again, and pre&s;erve it as before.</P>
<P>The third way to re&s;tore the &s;trength of Gun-Powder, is &s;uch as is mo&s;t plain and commonly u&s;ed among&s;t the Powder-men; they put upon a Sale-cloath or &s;mooth place or board, a portion of damnified Powder, to which they add an equal weight of that which is new made, and then with their hand or wooden Shovel they mingle it well together; then they dry it in the Sun, and put it up into a Barrel again, and keep it in a dry and proper place.</P>
<P>Yet there is another way may be allowed, but this is almo&s;t the &s;ame with making new Powder, and it is thus; Take what quantity of decayed Powder you plea&s;e, put it into Earthen or Wooden Ve&s;&s;els, pour upon the &s;ame three times &s;o much hot water, &s;tir it well about, and when it begins to be cold, or hath &s;tood one hour or two, &s;train the water away, and to the feces put more water, &s;tirring it well about, then let it &s;tand and &s;ettle as before, and &s;train it from the feces, this do a third time, and you will have drawn out all the Salt-Peter; put the&s;e waters in a clean Kettle, and boyl it away until &s;o much be con&s;umed, as that a drop dropped upon a Stone or Iron do congeal, then pour it into &s;ome wooden Ve&s;&s;el that it may congeal into Salt-Peter; and that water as remains, you mu&s;t boyl up again as before; and if need be, you mu&s;t in the boyling skum what ri&s;eth on the top of the water. Having by this Art obtained the Salt-Peter out of the decayed Gun-Powder, you may according to the proportions given in the Compo&s;ition of Powder, mix it with its remaining Sul|phur and Coal, or fre&s;h Sulphur and Coal, which is better; and after 'tis well mixed, Corn it according to the given Rules; then let it be well d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">yed, and put up into dry Powder Barrels, and let it be con&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ved in a dry place from Air or any Moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Some do mend their Powder in this nature, they moi&s;ten it with Vinegar or fair water, beat it fine, and &s;ift it and dry it, and to every pound of Powder they put one Ounce of Mealed Salt-Peter; then moi&s;ten and mix them well, &s;o that neither may be di&s;cerned one from the other, but that they be perfectly incorporated, which you may know by cutting the Ma&s;s with a Knife, or breaking it: When it is well compounded, let it be Corned in manner as we have before pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>If your Compo&s;ition of Powder be made up with <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and &s;o made up into great Balls, and well dryed in a Stove, or in the Sun, and put into glazed earthen Pots, and clo&s;e covered, you may keep it as long as you plea&s;e, for age will not decay it.</P>
<P>There ought alwayes a care to be taken by Gunners or Fire-Ma&s;ters, or &s;uch as have the charge of Gun-powder, to chu&s;e if they can &s;uch places as are dry, and &s;tand upon the be&s;t ground, free from dampne&s;s of the Air or any water po&s;&s;ibly coming near. Every Gunner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ought to take care that his Barrel be turned up&s;ide down, or any Carthredge ready filled; for if the Powder attract air, the Peter with the moi&s;ture it hath attracted, will in time &s;eperate from the other matters, and &s;ink to the bottom; &s;o that the Powder in the upper part will loo&s;e its &s;trength, which is prevented by turning and &s;haking them every fourteen dayes, and airing them at the Sun at convenient times. And as 'tis nece&s;&s;ary a Gunner &s;hould have Carthredges filled for pre&s;ent Service, tho&s;e ought al&s;o to be turned out and filled again every four|teen dayes more or le&s;s, as the Gunner in his judgment &s;hall allow of.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the property and particular office of every Ma|terial in the Compo&s;ition of Gun-powder.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE ought infallibly to believe that Gun-Powder was not found out ca&s;ually, or by fortune; but invented by a true knowledge, and by rea&s;onable &s;pe|culation in Natural Philo&s;ophy; con&s;idering that to this day no man hath oppo&s;ed (notwith&s;tanding many per&s;ons have made it their endeavour) or could find any other Materials like unto the&s;e, or of &s;uch a nature, which being well united and in|corporated together, they are able to produce a fire &s;o vigorous, fearful, powerful, and above all, &s;o inextingui&s;hable that the whole Univer&s;al matter is con&s;umed in a moment; which is the more to be believed, &s;ince we make not much difficulty, particularly in this our Age wherein we live, to add many things to the invention of others, and that (as the Phy&s;itians &s;ay) all that had a beginning doth pa&s;s from imperfection to perfection. We de&s;ire therefore it may be permitted (&s;ince the Inventors have left us nothing in Writing) to propo&s;e here &s;ome Ob&s;erva|tions of Speculative truths, drawn from Experiment, which have been made about the &s;trength, nature, effects, and Office of all the matters comprehended in the Compo&s;ition of Gun-Powder, as well of the particulars, as all made up into one body. For I believe, that having in&s;inuated into a perfect knowledge of the pro|perties, and the affections, as well &s;pecificated as general, of all its Ingredients, no body more will fall into tho&s;e Errors which are too often committed in the Art of <HI>Pyrotechny.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore know, that Gun-powder was not without rea&s;on compo&s;ed of the&s;e three materials, to wit, Salt-Pete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, Sulphur, and Coal, but to the end that one might remedy or &s;upply the defaults of the others. And this is it which is ea&s;ie to be comprehended in the effect of Sulphur; for this is naturally the very aliment of the fire, &s;eeing it joyns with it &s;o willingly and freely, and having once taken fire, is mo&s;t difficult to put out, being no otherwi&s;e rightly than a flaming fire, or, to ex|pre&s;s it better, a pure flame; and therefore hath an aptitude to enflame the Salt-Peter, by its activity, more than any other kind of fire. But as the Salt-Peter lighted doth go promptly into certain windy exhalations, it hath thereby &s;uch a &s;trength in it, that it would by its vento&s;ity put out the flame which the Sulphur hath concei|ved, and by con&s;equence deny it &s;elf of that which the Sulphur communicateth to it; hereby you may &s;ee, if one had made a &s;imple compo&s;ition of the&s;e two things only, that is, of Sulphur and Salt-Peter compounded well together, if fire were then applyed, they would in truth be &s;uddenly enflamed, but they would &s;oon after go out, that is, the fire will not continue to the Conflagration and Con&s;umption of the whole mat|ter, the rea&s;on whereof we have given a little before. It was therefore by good rea|&s;on adjudged, that Coal well dryed and powdered, being adjoyned to the&s;e two ma|terials in a certain proportion, was an excellent remedy for the &s;upplying of this de|fect, &s;eeing that Coal is of &s;uch a property and of &s;uch a nature, that if it be held to the fire, it will &s;oon light and be reduced to a fire without any flame; And from hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the more it is agitated by the Air, or by wind, the more the fire augments, and will not go out, but con&s;erve it &s;elf until the matter that nouri|&s;heth it is totally con&s;umed; a little a&s;hes only excepted. From hence it was conclu|ded that a Compo&s;ition made of the&s;e three Ingredients, &s;uch as is our Gunpowder, will conceive fire, and will be con&s;erved, enflamed and con&s;umed unto the la&s;t Atome. For it is mo&s;t certain, that if we approach fire with it, the Sulphur which the fire extreamly loves is &s;oon taken with it, and holdeth the &s;ame and introduceth it, not
<PB N="25" REF="15"> only into the Salt-Peter, but the coal al&s;o at the &s;ame moment, without producing any flame. Now this fire (as we have &s;aid before) cannot be &s;uffocated by wind, but on the contrary is enflamed the more, and takes new &s;trength by the agitation of the Air. And as this Sulphur is a great neighbour of the fire either with or without flame, &s;o it cannot hinder it from taking fire; and 'tis the flame of the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">im&s;tone imbraces the Salt-Peter, and the Coal continues it. And by con&s;equence the&s;e three materials joyned together, and well incorporated, and then lighted, produceth a fire, until all its aliment and &s;ub&s;tance be univer&s;ally con&s;umed and annihilated: Yet there mu&s;t care be taken that none of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances have any accidental defaults, either in humidity or di&s;proportion, either more or le&s;s. We will conclude then all that we have &s;aid, that the true office of Sulphur in the Powder is to conceive the flame or re|ceive the fire, and having received it, to communicate it to the other matters; and that the Coal hath a particular care to retain and con&s;ume it&punc; and to hinder the fire (after it is once introduced by the Sulphur) from &s;uffocating or going out by any windy Exhalation and great violence cau&s;ed by the Salt-Peter; and la&s;tly, that the mo&s;t notable and particular office of the Salt-Peter is to produce and cau&s;e a mo&s;t vehement and powerful vento&s;ity or windy Exhalation. And in this which I have &s;aid, lieth all the truth of the &s;trength, power and expul&s;ive motion and activity of the Gun-powder; and by con&s;equence Salt-Peter alone is the fir&s;t and principal cau&s;e of all the admirable and a&s;toni&s;hing Effects produced by Gunpowder; and con&s;eqnent|ly, the two other materials are alliated with the Salt-Peter for no other end than to make it break forth into fire and wind. For proof of this, if any one will make a Compo&s;ition of Sulphur and Coal only, and with it charge a Piece of Ordnance, he will find that this will not move or thru&s;t out a Shot of Iron or any other metal; the rea&s;on of this weakne&s;s is ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood by our foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e the violent expul&s;ion depends ab&s;olutely in the Salt-Peter, and in this only expul&s;ive faculty, and not in any of the other matters. Yea I believe that one may prepare Gun|powder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ithout Brim&s;tone or Coal, rather than without Salt-Peter; or that a man may without much difficulty prepare other matters, that the one may do the office of Sulphur in kindling the matter, and the other that of Coal in Con&s;erving it and keeping it without flame. But any other thing that hath &s;uch hidden natural properties to cau&s;e &s;uch a ventous Exhalation, &s;o violent and capable to produce &s;uch prodigious Effects, as Salt-Peter, may not be produced.</P>

<P>VVE have already in the Second Chapter of this Book &s;hewn the way of mol|ding and ca&s;ting peices of Ordnance; if well under&s;tood, you cannot be ig|norant in the way of Ca&s;ting Shot.

<P>Begin at your right hand, (as you did in Extracting the Square Root) and &s;et pricks under every fourth figure, that is, leave two figures unprickt, or between the pricks, and &s;o proceed to the left, until you have done as here you &s;ee, 7 5 6 7 8 7 3 2 (the number of pricks &s;hew the number of figures that will be in the quotient.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>QUEST. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>By knowing the Diameter and Weight of any one Shot, to find the Weight of another Shot, being both of one and the &s;ame Metal.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Shot who&s;e weight we know not, we mu&s;t have in Diameter likewi&s;e, which is found thus, Gird the Shot with a Line, then divide that into twenty two e|qual parts, and &s;even of tho&s;e is the Diameter or the height of the Shot.</P>
<P>But if you have a pair of Callapars by you, the be&s;t way is to take the Diameter with them. The fa&s;hion and form of taking the Diameter of a Shot, is as here you &s;ee in the figure following. <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>woodcut of calipers measuring a piece of shot</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>If an Iron Shot of 4 Inches Diameter weigh 9 <HI>l.</HI> what &s;hall a Shot weigh who&s;e Diameter is twice as much, that is, 8 In|ches.</P>
<P>Cube each Diameter, then multiply the Cube of the Shot who&s;e weight is required by the Diameter of the given Shot, and that Sum divided by the Cube of the known Diameter, the quotient is the Diameter of the Shot required.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>This que&s;tion may al&s;o be performed by the former Table of Cubes, if you &s;earch in the Collum of Roots until you find your Diameters in a right Line with the &s;ame
<PB N="37" REF="21"> under the word Cube, you will find the Cube an&s;werable to the number given, thus; you will find the Cube of 4 to be 64, and of 8 to be 512, and this 512 multiplyed by the weight of the known Bullet, <HI>viz. 9 l.</HI> it makes 4608, which divided by 64, gives the weight of the Bullet to be 72 <HI>l.</HI> which was to be known.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>QUEST. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Knowing the Diameter and weight of one Shot, to find the Diameter of a Shot that weigheth twice as much.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Suppo&s;e the known Shot was 4 Inches Diameter, and weigh 9 pound, and it were required to find the Diameter of a Shot, who&s;e weight is twice as much, that is 18, find the Cube-Root of each Shots weight, then multiply the Diameter of the Shot who&s;e weight is known, by the Cube of the Diameter of the Shot who&s;e weight is required; and that Sum divided by the Cube of the Diameter of the known Shot and the quotient is the Diameter required. Example. By the former Rule, or by the Ta|ble, the Cube of the pounds will be found to be 2, 08, and the Cube of 18 will be 2, 62, now multiply this la&s;t number by 4, and it makes 9, 48, which divided by 2, 08 will give in the quotient 5, 03 for the Diameter required.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion may very ea&s;ily be wrought by the Line of numbers, thus; divide the di&s;tance between 9 and 18 into three equal parts, and that extent will reach from 4 In|ches to 5, 03 Inches, the Diameter required.</P>

<P>Make a Square of the Diameter of the le&s;&s;er Bullet, then draw a Line from Corner to Corner, and this Line thus drawn &s;hall be the Diameter of a Shot twice the weight of the other; which if you divide into two equal parts, &s;etting one foot of your compa&s;&s;es in the middle, you may draw a Circle, and that circumference will repre&s;ent unto you a Bullet twice the weight of the le&s;&s;er Diameter.</P>
<P>This work may be proved Arithmetically thus; the Diameter of the le&s;&s;er Bullet is 4 Inches, the Square thereof 16, which being doubled is 32; and the &s;quare Root of this 32 is 5, 65, and &s;o much is the Diameter of the greater Bullet, which weighed 18 <HI>l.</HI> There ari&s;eth here a difference between this way and the former, but this way is the mo&s;t true; not but that both Rules are true in them&s;elves, but the former de|pending upon finding the Cube Roots, which cannot be found much more exacter than what I have done, and &s;o working by them, and they not being exact, cau&s;es the difference in the work.</P>

<DIV5 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Mr. <HI>Gunter</HI> in his fir&s;t Book, Section 4. hath &s;hewed how to make a Line of Solids on his Sector; but this Rule &s;hews us the proportion of the Diameters in Weight, ha|ving a Shot of one pound, two pounds, three pounds weight of Metal, or &s;tone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For if the given Shot be one pound, divide the diameter of that Shot into 4 equal parts, and 5 &s;uch parts will make a Diameter of a Shot of the &s;aid Metal, as is propo&s;ed, that &s;hall weigh ju&s;t twice as much. And divide the Diameter of a Shot that weighs ju&s;t two pounds into &s;even equal parts, and eight &s;uch parts will make the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds weight. And Divide the Diameter of a Shot of 3 pounds, into 10 equal parts, and 11 of &s;uch parts will give a Shot of 4 pounds weight. And di|vide a Shot of 4 pounds weight into 13 parts, and 14 &s;uch parts will make a Shot of 5 pounds in weight. And divide the Diameter of a Shot of 5 pounds weight, into 16 equal parts, and 17 &s;uch parts will make a Diameter of a &s;hot that will weigh 6 pounds. And &s;o dividing the Diameter of a &s;hot 6 pounds weight into 19 equal parts, and 20 &s;uch parts will make a Diameter of a &s;hot that will weigh 7 pounds. Thus dividing each next Diameter into three equal parts more than the next le&s;s Diameter was divided into, and with one part added to the Diameter of a &s;hot it will weigh ju&s;t one pound more, and &s;o may proceed infinitely.</P>

<DIV5 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>A &s;econd way to Perform this work.</HEAD>
<P>Find exactly the Diameter of a &s;hot who&s;e weight is ju&s;t one pound, then de&s;cribe a Circle who&s;e Diameter &s;hall be equal thereunto, and divide it into four equal parts, as <HI>a b c d,</HI> and draw the two Diameters <HI>a c</HI> and <HI>d b</HI> cro&s;&s;ing the Center, and then take the di&s;tance <HI>d c</HI> in your Compa&s;&s;es, and lay it off from <HI>e</HI> to 2, and this will be a &s;hot of two pounds weight.</P>
<P>Then take the di&s;tance <HI>d</HI> 2, in your Compa&s;&s;es, and &s;et it off from <HI>e</HI> to 3, &s;o will that di&s;tance be the Diameter of a &s;hot of three pounds weight; and &s;o you may proceed in the &s;ame manner at your plea&s;ure; as you may &s;ee by the projection.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e having the Diameter of a Shot of any weight, the double of the Diameter is the Diameter of a Shot that weighs eight times as much. So that if a Shot of four Inches Diameter weigh nine pounds, a Shot of eight inches Diameter will weigh &s;eventy two pounds; as you may &s;ee by this following Table of the weights of Shot. <FIGURE>

<P><HI>The Proportions between Bullets of Iron and Bullets of Lead or Stone, that is, by knowing the Weight of an Iron Shot, to find the Weight of a Shot of the &s;ame Diameter made of Lead or Stone.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The Proportion between Lead and Iron is as 3 to 2, &s;o that a Shot of two pound of Iron is the &s;ame Diameter as a Shot of 3 pounds of Lead.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> If a Shot of Iron of 3&frac12; Inches Diameter weigh 6 pounds, what will a Shot of Lead of the &s;ame Diameter?</P>
<P>For 3&frac12; Inches put 3, 5, and &s;ay, if 2 give 3, 5, what will 3 give? <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>This 52&frac12; pounds is the weight of a Shot of Lead of 3 Inches and a half Diameter.</P>
<P>The proportion between Iron and Stone is as 3 to 8, &s;o that a Shot of 12 pound of &s;tone is as big, or the &s;ame in Diameter, as the like Shot of Iron that weighs 32 pounds; but &s;ome &s;ay the proportion between Marble and Iron is as 15 to 34.</P>
<P>A Bullet of Lead to the like of Marble is in proportion as 4 to 1.</P>
<P>The proportion between Lead and Bra&s;s is as 24 is to 19.</P>
<P>The proportion between Iron and Lead, as &s;ome &s;ay, is as 19 to 28.</P>
<P>The proportion between Iron and Bra&s;s is as 16 to 18.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Rules we may Calculate a Table very ea&s;ily, to know if an Iron Shot be wanting, and a Shot of any of the other metals to be had, what height and weight either Shot of Lead Bra&s;s or Stone ought to be, to fit any piece of Ordnance; and by the &s;ame method we have here Calculated a Table, which doth &s;hew the weight of any Shot of Iron, Lead or Stone; from 2 Inches to 9 Inches.</P>
<P>This is worthy to be ob&s;erved, that you ought not to have &s;o much Powder to Load a Piece that mu&s;t di&s;charge a Marble Shot, as an Iron Shot; but the proportion mu&s;t be abated as the proportions between Stone and Iron doth allow of.</P>

<P>YOu mu&s;t provide a Pike-&s;taff, about a foot longer than the bore of the Piece, and at the end thereof fa&s;ten a Rammer head, that will ju&s;t fill all the bore to the touch hole; and at the other end of the &s;taff, you mu&s;t bore a hole big enough to put through a Rod of Iron, which mu&s;t hand from the &s;ame; and at the other end of the Rod mu&s;t be made a weight about the bigne&s;s of a Saker Shot, this is done to make the Pike-&s;taff and Rammer head to lie with the &s;ame &s;ide upward when they are taken out of the Piece, as they did when they were within the Piece; then you mu&s;t put your In&s;trument thus prepared into the Piece, letting the Iron Ball (that is at the end of the Rod, which is put through the hole bored a cro&s;s the Pike-&s;taff) hand per|pendicular; then take your priming Iron, or &s;ome other bodkin, and put it down the touch hole to the Rammer head, making a mark therewith; this done, draw out your In&s;trument, and lay the &s;ame on a long Table, with the Iron Ball hanging off the end perpendicular, as it did when the In&s;trument was in the Piece; then ob&s;erve, whether the mark you made upon the Rammer head when it was in the Piece, be ju&s;t upon the uppermo&s;t part of the &s;ame, if it be, the bore of the Piece lies neither to the right hand nor to the left; but if you find it any thing to the right or left hand, &s;o much lyeth the bore either to the right or left, and the Piece in Shooting mu&s;t be or|dered and charged accordingly.</P>

<P><HI>The making of Rammers, Spunges, Ladles, and Cartredges, Formers, Carriages, Wheels, Trucks</HI> &amp;c. <HI>with the Height of Shot fit for any Piece.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOr the better expedition of this work we have in the former Table &s;hewed the length and breadth of each Ladle, always remembring that you cut each Ladle &s;omewhat longer, that is, allowing &s;o much more as mu&s;t be fa&s;tned to the &s;taff, or &s;o much as the &s;taff goes within the Plate.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="27">
<P>The Buttons or heads of the Ladles mu&s;t be near the height of the &s;hot.</P>
<P>For Spunges, the bottoms and heads mu&s;t be of &s;oft wood, as Birch and Willow, and to be one Diameter and three quarters in length, and three quarters or very little le&s;s of the height covered with Sheeps skin, and nayled with Copper nayles, &s;o that together they may fill the hollow of the Piece; Let the bottoms and heads of the Rammers be made of good hard wood, and the height, one Diameter of the Shot, and the length one third of the Diameter of the Shot.</P>
<P>To make Ladles for Chamber bor'd Pieces, open your Compa&s;&s;es to the ju&s;t Di|ameter of the Chamber within one eighth part of an Inch, Divide that mea&s;ure in two equal parts, then &s;et the mea&s;ure to one of them, and by that di&s;tance upon a flat or paper draw a Circle, the Diameter of that Circle is one fourth part &s;hor|ter than the Diameter of the Chamber; Take three fifths of that Circle for the breadth of the Plate of the Ladle. But for Cannon, the length ought to be twice and two third parts, to hold at twice the ju&s;t Diameter of the Powder. As for Example,</P>
<P>The Diameter of a Circle drawn for a Cannon who&s;e Chamber bore is 7 Inches, containeth &s;ix and three quarters, the circumference whereof is 21 Inches 6/7, and three fourth parts thereof is 12 &frac34;, and &s;o much ought the Ladle to be in breadth, and in length 18 &frac23; parts. By this Rule you may make a Ladle for any Taper'd Piece.</P>
<P>Take notice for a general ob&s;ervation, that a Ladle 9 balls in length, and two balls in breadth, will near contain the ju&s;t weight in Powder, that the Iron Shot for any piece weigheth.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, for Cartredges, they are generally made of paper Royal or Canvas. Take the height of the bore of your piece without the vent of the Shot, and cut the cloath or paper of 3 &s;uch heights, for the Cannon in length 3 Diameters, for the Culve|rin 4 Diameters, for the Saker and Faulcon <HI>&amp;c.</HI> half of the height of their proper bores, and leaving in the mid&s;t at the top or bottome one other &s;uch height, to make a bottom for the Cartredge, cutting each &s;ide &s;omthing larger for Sewing, glewing, or pa&s;ting them together; you mu&s;t have a great care to augment the goodne&s;s of your powder, and likewi&s;e the heating of your Piece, and &s;o augment or dimini&s;h the quantity of Powder.</P>
<P>Let your Former be made to your Ordnance to the height of your Shot, and a convenient length longer than the Cartredge ought to be, and tallow it over fir&s;t that the paper may &s;lip off, and then put your paper on your Former. If you make your Cartredge of Canvas, half a Diameter more is allowed for &s;eams, but if you make it of paper, half or three quarters of an Inch over-plus for pa&s;ting will &s;erve, be|ing lapt once about the Former; having the bottom fitted upon the end of the Former, which mu&s;t be hard and clo&s;e pa&s;ted by the lower &s;ide of the Cartredge, then let the lower end of the Cartredge be pa&s;ted down hard round about the bottom, and let them be well dryed before you fill them, and mark them how high they mu&s;t be filled.</P>
<P>And if you have no Scales nor weights by you for Cannons, put two Diameters and a half for the height the powder mu&s;t come, for Culverin 3 Diameters, for Saker 3 and a half Diameters, for le&s;&s;er Pieces four Diameters of the Cylinder.</P>
<P>For Carriages of Pieces of Ordnance for Land &s;ervice the Rules are given thus one and a half the length of the Cylender is the length of the Carriage, and in depth four Diameters of the bore of the Piece at the fore end, in the middle three and a half, and at the end next the ground two and a half, let the thickne&s;s be the Diameter of the Shot, the wheels &s;hould be one half of the length of the Piece in height, but for Sa|ker and Minion you mu&s;t exceed the former proportion by one twelfth part, the Faulcon and Faulconet by the &s;ixth part.</P>
<P>The Naves, the Cheeks called Limbres, and wheels, are u&s;ually made of Elm, but the Tran&s;oms, Axeltreces, Fore-Carriage and Cro&s;s beams, are made of Oaken Timber.</P>
<P>For drawing of Guns by men in ca&s;e hor&s;es be wanting, there is u&s;ually allowed to every &s;ixty, eighty, or a hundred weight of metal to one man, according to the na|ture of the ground whereon they are to be drawn.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="27">
<P>As for Sea Carriages, they are &s;o well known to every Carriage-maker that they need not to be &s;poken of.</P>
<P>As for fitting Shot to each Piece, it is the opinion of mo&s;t Gunners, that every Piece of Ordnance ought to have its Shot within one quarter of an Inch of the Diameter of the bore; others do &s;ay, that the one and twentieth part of the Diameter of the Piece's Cylender is more proper and corre&s;pondent for all &s;orts of Pieces what&s;oever; Eve|ry man may make choice of that which by experience he finds be&s;t.</P>

Stick up your Lin&s;tock to Leeward of you; then to work with your Piece. Fir&s;t, cleer your Piece within with the Scowrer, and &s;ee that the touch hole be clear, and not &s;topped, and &s;o clear, that no dirt or filth be in the &s;ame; Then let him that is by to a&s;&s;i&s;t, (for a Piece cannot be man|naged by le&s;s than two) bring the Budg-barrel with the powder ju&s;t before the mouth of your Piece, put then your Ladle into the &s;ame and fill it, and if it be over-full, give it a little jog, that the overplus may fall down again into the barrel; after this, put it gently in at the mouth of the Piece, even until the end of the Ladle be thru&s;t up to the Britch end of the Piece; then mu&s;t you turn the Ladle gently and &s;oftly, and let it lie within the Chamber of the piece, drawing out your Ladle almo&s;t to the Muzzle of the Piece, put it back again to take up the loo&s;e corns, which were &s;pilt by the way, and to bring them up to the Charge of powder; this done, the Gunner mu&s;t draw out his Ladle, and take out of the Budg-barrel a &s;econd Ladle full, (by our former Rules given he mu&s;t know the quantity of powder that his Piece will re|quire) and &s;o putting it in the Piece up to the former Ladle-full, then you may draw it out, and do as you did before, that no loo&s;e corns may lie in the bottom of the Piece; and in drawing out his Ladle, he mu&s;t have a care that he let not fall any powder upon the ground; for it is a thing uncomly in a Gunner, to trample powder under feet. Then take a wi&s;p of Straw, Hay, or any other thing, and put it hard in at the mouth of the Piece, then turn your Ladle end for end to come to the Rammer, thru&s;t it in|to the Piece after the wi&s;p, and drive it up with it, and it will carry all the loo&s;e corns which po&s;&s;ibly may be &s;cattered in the Mold of the Piece; having driven the wad up to the powder, give it two or three gentle &s;hoves to make it lie clo&s;e only, but drive it not too hard lea&s;t you break your powder too much, which would hinder its force; The wi&s;p or wad being clo&s;e to the powder, draw out the Rammer and put in the Bullet, which rowle gently in the Piece up to the wad that was before put in to keep up the powder; the Shot being in, put in a &s;econd wad after the Bullet, and thru&s;t it al&s;o home to
<PB N="50" REF="28"> the Bullet. Always remembring whil&s;t the powder is putting in and wadding up, one be ready at the touch hole and keep it &s;topt with his thumb, that no powder fly out at the touch hole, but that it be likewi&s;e filled with powder, which may be &s;upplyed out of his powder-horn.</P>
<P>The Gunner that Loads a Piece is to be very careful, and indeavour always not to &s;tand before the muzzle of his Piece whil&s;t he is loading the Piece, but on one &s;ide of the &s;ame, lea&s;t a danger or mi&s;chief might happen to him. And thus the Piece ha|ving its due Charge of Powder and Bullet, he mu&s;t cover the touch-hole with an Apron made of Lead, or for want of that, with dryed Sheep-skin; then let him level his piece and &s;et away the Budg-barrel of powder with the re&s;t of his things, in &s;ome hollow place under the ground covered over &s;afe; he mu&s;t then attend the Gentleman of the Ordnance, or other chief Commander, their Order or Command, before he give fire.</P>
<P>Touching the Charges of Pieces, I have given full in&s;tructions nece&s;&s;ary there|unto, with the weight of powder and Shot for any piece. But to &s;ay &s;omething here touching the quantity of powder, proper for a Load; we do find &s;ome dif|ference among&s;t Authors; Some whereof do maintain, that there ought to be allow|ed to every Piece for its Charge &s;o much powder as half the weight of the Bullet; o|thers are of the opinion, that the more powder is put into a Piece, the &s;wifter and farther the Bullet will flye, urging many rea&s;ons to prove it. But experience, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of this Art in&s;tructeth us better, for if a Piece be loaden with two thirds of the weight of her Shot in powder, it &s;ends the Bullet or Shot going more &s;wiftly, and will carry it farther, which hath been very many and often times tryed, &s;o that at this time, 'tis without contradiction.</P>
<P>Again, others do maintain, that if one &s;hould forcibly Ramme the Bullet, then the powder might take fire before it ca&s;t forth the Bullet, and then would cau&s;e the Bul|let to flye farther than otherwi&s;e it would do; but you mu&s;t con&s;ider in &s;o doing, you either endanger the breaking of the piece, or el&s;e the making it crooked and un&s;er|viceable; becau&s;e your ordinary Pieces will not bear &s;o great a Charge of powder. This hath been tryed by the Sea &s;ide before his Excellency <HI>Prince Maurice,</HI> of famous memory, where fir&s;t one and the &s;ame Piece was Loaden with ten pound of fine pow|der, to &s;ee how far She would carry the Bullet; the place being marked where the Bullet re&s;ted. The Piece was loaden again with nine pounds of powder which &s;hot as far as when the Piece was Loaden with ten pounds of powder. But la&s;t of all, this piece of Ordnance being Loaden or Charged with 7 pounds of the &s;ame powder, it carried her Bullet further than the two former Shots; whence one may ob&s;erve that a piece of Ordnance may be over-Charged, and therefore a good Gunner ought to have a &s;ingular care to give unto his Piece her due mea&s;ure and Charge.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Office and Duty of a Gunner, with all his Properties, Endowments and qualifications.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE that intends to be a Ma&s;ter Gunner, and would not abu&s;e him&s;elf nor others of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be qualified according to our In&s;tructions follow|ing, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>He ought to be well skilled in Arithmetick, and to under&s;tand the Extraction of the Square and Cube Roots, and to have knowledge in Geometry, according to our
<PB N="51" REF="28"> In&s;tructions in the &s;econd part, whereby he may be able to take heights, depths, breadths and lengths, and to draw the plot of any piece of ground, to make Mines and Countermines, Rampars, Baskets of earth, and &s;uch like things u&s;ed in time of war, as well offen&s;ive as defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>He ought mo&s;t chiefly upon Land-Service to be well skilled in the making Plat|formers, with Defences, Troniers, Gabbions, Loops, Parapets of Earth, and Pag|gots of 23 or 24 foot high; two foot high of Earth, bed upon bed, unto eleven foot high, and after three foot <HI>Terra plene,</HI> to rai&s;e the Tronniers and Loops, &s;o that for the Cannon it be three foot wide in the Barbe, and within twelve foot wide, without the lower part thereof to de&s;cend Scarp-wi&s;e, the better to di&s;cover the E|nemies avenues and offend them more freely, for avoiding the bla&s;t and Smoak and ruine it would el&s;e make: for Culverin two foot and a half within, and nine foot without will &s;erve; and for le&s;s Pieces the le&s;s mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>If the Battery be to be made with Gabbions, they being filled with Earth without Stones, moi&s;tned and Rammed 7 foot in Diameter, three Ranks between two Pieces, if the place will permit, or two at lea&s;t; and three Rows al&s;o one before the other, &s;etting one between two, &s;o that if one Rank will have three, the &s;econd will have two, and the third one; but it will be hard to make a &s;afe Battery with Gabbions, Cannon or Culverin proof.</P>
<P>Concerning Plat-forms. Let the platform for a Cannon have thirty foot for rever&s;e, and 27 foot for a Demy-Cannon, and he ought to &s;ee that his plat-forms be even, or ri&s;ing one foot for 20 foot backward the better to &s;tay the Rever&s;e, and fa|cilitate the bringing the piece when Loaden to the Loop. The platform ought to be made clean, that no &s;tones or other things lye in the way for the wheels to run upon, whereby may be hindered the true intent of his Shot.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t before any &s;ervice is, examine his Piece of its goodne&s;s or defect; according to our former In&s;tructions given in this behalf, he mu&s;t al&s;o be furni&s;hed with all nece&s;&s;ary things for his Artillery, the particulars thereof we have mentioned in the 29 <HI>Chap.</HI> but becau&s;e it takes not up much paper we will repeat them here again, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Wheels, Trucks, Axeltrees, Ladles, Rammers, Spunges, Worms, Tampions, height-board, Auger-bit, fitne&s;s and roundne&s;s of the Shot, Chane-Shot, Cro&s;s|bar Shot <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Canvas or &s;trong paper for Cartredges, Calabers, Compa&s;&s;es, Sight Rule, Gunners Scale, Quadrant, Scales, Weights, priming-Irons, and Aprons to cover the Touch hole.</P>
<P>Before he come upon Service, he ought to examine and prove the goodne&s;s of his Powder and Match, and examine it according to the Rules given where we treat of the Examination of the goodne&s;s of Powder.</P>
<P>A Gunner ought to be mo&s;t careful to &s;ee that the Powder be placed &s;afely from danger of his own, as al&s;o the Enemies Ordnance, and to be furni&s;hed with artificial Torches, Dark Lanthorns, with all &s;orts of Fire-works, of which you &s;hall have a particular account in the Treati&s;e of Fire-works at the end of this Book.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t have by him his Gyn and Winch, Hand-Spikes, Crowes, to mount and di&s;mount Guns at plea&s;ure as occa&s;ion may &s;erve, al&s;o Coynes, Budge-Barrels, Powder Baskets to carry Shot to your Piece, to keep his Lin&s;tocks well armed with good Match.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t alwayes have by him a Ruler, Scale, Compa&s;&s;es, to mea&s;ure the Dia|meters or Bore of every Piece, and likewi&s;e the length of the Cylinder within, the better to fit her with due Shot and Proportion of Powder.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t learn by &s;uch In&s;tructions as we have already given, the Names, Length, Weight, and Fortification of every Piece about the Chamber, and to tell readily how much Powder is a due Charge for every Piece, and what Shot is nece&s;|&s;ary. How many Per&s;ons mu&s;t attend in time of Service, how many Hor&s;es or Oxen will draw a Piece of Ordnance, and in ca&s;e they be wanting, how many men will &s;erve. How many pound weight of Shot one man may drive before him in a Wheel-barrow from place to place.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="29">
<P>A Gunner ought chiefly to Charge and Di&s;charge a Piece of Ordnance Arti&s;t like; and when he opens, or orders to be opened the head of a Powder Barrel, let no Iron Tool be u&s;ed thereunto for fear of taking or &s;triking fire; for that purpo&s;e therefore it is u&s;ual to have wooden Mallets, which will prevent &s;uch dangers.</P>
<P>Every Gunner before he beginneth to make a Shot, ought to con&s;ider that a wad of Hay, or of untwi&s;ted Ropes, will make the Shot &s;hoot wide of the Mark.</P>
<P>He ought to con&s;ider whether the Trunions be placed in their due place in the Carriage, whether the Carriage have its due length, whether one wheel be not higher than the other, or whether one wheel doth not rever&s;e quicker or &s;ooner than the other, for the&s;e will cau&s;e the Piece to erre, and to &s;hoot wide of the Mark.</P>
<P>Every Gunner ought to con&s;ider, that if his Piece lye point blank or under Metal, then he ought to put in a &s;ufficient wad after the Shot, to keep it clo&s;e to the Powder; for if it &s;hould not be clo&s;e, great danger might follow; for if the Shot &s;hould lodge any di&s;tance from the Powder, then in the firing of that Piece it would break off in that very vacant place between the Shot and the Powder, and &s;o do dammage to him&s;elf or &s;tanders by. If your Piece be mounted, you then u&s;e no wad at all after the Shot.</P>
<P>Every Gunner ought to have &s;tanding by him &s;ome Tubs of water to wet his Spunges in, whereby to cool his Piece in time of Service, as al&s;o to be ready upon occa&s;ion to put out any Fire that might happen in time of Service.</P>
<P>Every Gunner ought to try whether his Piece is truely bored or not; if it be not, he is to take it into con&s;ideration, and to order his proportion of Charge, according to the thinne&s;t part of the Metal, to prevent all danger.</P>
<P>A Gunner ought to take his Ob&s;ervation of the Mark or place he intends to direct his Shot to, ju&s;t over the middle of the bore within the Piece, for by this means he may be able, by his Skill, to make a true Shot in a bad Piece.</P>
<P>A Gunner, that he may the better direct his Shot to the place de&s;ired, ought to con&s;ider the difference of the Metal of the Piece at Britch and Muzzle, and thereby truely how to di&s;part a Piece, be it either true bored or not. Of di&s;parting a Piece, I &s;hall &s;hew how it may be done &s;everal wayes in the following or &s;econd part of this Gunnery; where we come to the practical part of the Art in handling a Piece of Ordnance upon all occa&s;ions.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>COnvey the left &s;ide of the Quadrant Geometrically towards the Sun, the Thread and Plummet having their free cour&s;e, moving it up or down until both your &s;ights have received the Sun-beams; then if your Thread be found in the twelfth part, all things that are upright or truly perpendicularly elevated, are equal in height with their &s;hadows.</P>
<P>If the Thread with the plummet be ob&s;erved to cut any of tho&s;e parts next the &s;ights, called right &s;hadow, between <HI>m</HI> and <HI>h,</HI> then every upright thing is more than the &s;ha|dow, by &s;uch a proportion as 12 exceeds the parts where the Thread was found.</P>
<P>If the Thread fall upon the fir&s;t divi&s;ion, then 12 times the &s;hadow is the height. If it fall upon the &s;econd Divi&s;ion, 6 times the &s;hadow is the height. If it fall upon the third Divi&s;ion, 4 times the &s;hadow is the height. If it fall on the fourth Divi&s;ion, 3 times the &s;hadow is the height. In the fifth Divi&s;ion twice and two fifths of the &s;hadow is the height. In the &s;ixth twice, in the &s;eventh once, and five &s;evenths in the eighth Divi&s;ion, one and a half in the ninth, one and a third in the tenth, one and a fifth part in the eleventh, once and the eleventh part of the &s;hadow is the height on the twelfth part, then the length of the &s;hadow is the height, as we &s;aid before.</P>
<P>Or in few words it may be done thus, Multiply the length of the &s;hadow by 12, the product divided by the parts in which you found the Thread, your quotient &s;heweth the height.</P>
<P>But if the part cut be on the contrary &s;hadow, that is, if the Thread fall between <HI>g</HI> and <HI>m,</HI> augment then the length of the &s;hadow by the parts declared by the plummet, and the increa&s;e divide by 12, and the product is the Altitude.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>How to make a true Di&s;part of any true bored Piece of Ordnance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>KNow fir&s;t, that to di&s;part a Piece of Ordnance, is no otherwi&s;e than to bring the Diameter at Muzzle to be equal to the Diameter at the Ba&s;e Ring; in true founde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ordnance, half of the Diameter of the Cylender is the di&s;part; but more generally it may be done thus, Gird the Piece round about the Britch with a thred, after do the like by the Muzzle Ring, lay the&s;e two &s;trings &s;treight upon a Table at length, and make two marks for the length of each &s;tring; divide the di&s;tance between each of the&s;e two marks into 22 equal parts with your Compa&s;&s;es, and 7 of them are their Diameters; then mea&s;ure how much each Diameter is in length, and &s;ub&s;tract one Diameter from the other, then take the ju&s;t half of the difference, and that is the true di&s;part of your Piece in inches, and part of an inch.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Diameters are better and more artificially taken with a pair of Crallipars, as we have &s;hewed before in taking the Diameter of a Shot, and then mea&s;ured upon your Scale of inches and parts, will give you the true Diameters of the Piece both at Britch and Muzzle, with which work as above.</P>
<P>Al&s;o you may find the true di&s;part of a Piece thus; Put a &s;mall Wyer or priming Iron in at the Touch-hole of the Piece to the bottom of the Concave; then mind what part of that Iron is even with the Ba&s;e Ring, and make a mark there; then take it out and apply it to the Muzzle, and place it upon the lower edge of the Concave of
<PB N="72" REF="44"> the Piece as upright as you can, and mind what part of the Iron or Wyer is even with the upper part of the Muzzle Ring, and there make a mark; for the difference between the&s;e two marks, is the true di&s;part of the Piece: or after you have placed your Iron upon the Muzzle as before, cau&s;e a di&s;part to be rai&s;ed &s;o high as that mark which was made upon the Iron when 'twas put down the Touch-hole.</P>
<P>If from the top of the di&s;part a fine thread or line be carried to the Muzzle Ring, you will &s;ee how high you may make a di&s;part at the Trunions.</P>
<P>Or thus a di&s;part may be made at the Trunions; lay a peece of &s;oft Wax upon the Trunions, and let one rai&s;e it high, or depre&s;s it, until that the Metal at the top of the Ba&s;e Ring, the Wax between the Trunions, and the di&s;part of the Muzzle, be all three of one height preci&s;ely; but the former way with a thread is more exact.</P>
<P>A Piece of Ordnance may be di&s;parted thus; take two &s;ticks (each of them mu&s;t be longer than the Piece) and al&s;o make a Plummet of Lead to hang in a &s;mall thread made fa&s;t to one end of the &s;tick, which lay cro&s;s the top of the Ba&s;e Ring, to and fro, until the Plummet de&s;cending from the end thereof, may ju&s;t touch the &s;ide of the Metal of the &s;aid Ring; then keeping fa&s;t the &s;tick in that place, hang your Plum|met down by the other &s;ide of the &s;tick, until it on the other&s;ide ju&s;t touch the Metal of the Ba&s;e Ring; when you have done, cut off the &s;tick ju&s;t in that place by which the Plummet de&s;cended, perpendicularly, and this length is the ju&s;t Diameter of the Ba&s;e Ring; after this manner you mu&s;t proceed to take the Diameter at the Muzzle. Then la&s;tly, &s;et the&s;e two &s;ticks together even at one end, and mark their difference in length or height; for ju&s;t half of that difference is the di&s;part of that Piece.</P>
<P>I would advi&s;e all Sea Gunners upon &s;ome occa&s;ions to u&s;e Di&s;parts between the Trunions of their Pieces, made of a ju&s;t height, on purpo&s;e to &s;erve that place, by the method we have even now pre&s;cribed, and let them be tyed about the Piece with a twine, becau&s;e el&s;e at every Shot they will be to &s;eek, when upon a &s;uddain they &s;hould u&s;e them, and they will much avail and &s;tand them in great &s;tead. I could expre&s;s other wayes, only I think the&s;e &s;ufficient.</P>

<P>SEt your di&s;part on the Muzzle Ring, ju&s;t over the Center of the mouth of the Piece, which you may be&s;t do by putting a &s;tick cro&s;s the bore, and dividing it into two equal parts; then with a Plumb line hanging over the mouth of the Piece, being guided by the divided &s;tick, you &s;hall have good aim where to &s;et your Di&s;part; this being done, go to the Ba&s;e Ring, if the Piece be true bored, then find which is the highe&s;t part, and middle of that Ring; but if the Piece be not true bored, then find which part of the Ba&s;e Ring is ju&s;t over the Cylender, and take that for your true line: when you have found out the di&s;part, and placed it, and al&s;o found what point in the Ba&s;e Ring is to an&s;wer to it, then make &s;ome very &s;mall mark on the Ba&s;e Ring in that place, hold your head about two foot from the Ba&s;e Ring, and there you may be&s;t ob&s;erve, as the Piece is traver&s;ing, when you are in a direct line with the mark; this done, give one of your men order to rai&s;e and fall the Piece with his Hand-&s;pike as you &s;hall appoint him, until you can, holding your head two foot from the Britch of the Piece, with your eye perceive the mark at the Ba&s;e Ring, and the top of the di&s;part in a direct line with the mark you mu&s;t &s;hoot at; at that in&s;tant &s;top the motion of the Piece with a Coyn, that it may remain as you have directed it; then Prime your Piece, and give fire.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter you have made one Shot, and find the Piece carry ju&s;t over the mark, then do all that has been taught again, and when your Piece lyes directly again&s;t the mark, ob&s;erve how much the la&s;t &s;troak of the Shot is above the mark, &s;o much longer make your di&s;part, that the top of it may be ju&s;t &s;een from the Britch of the Piece, in a direct line with the &s;troke of the Shot; when it is of this length, then level your Piece with this new di&s;part to the a&s;&s;igned mark, Give fire, and without doubt it will &s;trike the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t Shot &s;trike under the mark, then bring the Piece in all points as before to pa&s;s, mark how much of the di&s;part is over the &s;troke of the Shot, and cut it ju&s;t &s;o &s;hort, as being at the Britch you may di&s;cern the top of it, with the mark on the Ba&s;e Ring and &s;troke of the Shot in a ju&s;t right line, and when you perceive it is of &s;uch a length, level the Piece to the a&s;&s;igned mark, as at the fir&s;t, then Prime and Give fire.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t Shot &s;trike on the right hand of the mark, to mend it you mu&s;t level the Piece as formerly; you &s;tanding behind the Britch of the Piece, ob&s;erve the &s;troke of the Shot over the di&s;part, and that part of the Ba&s;e Ring as you at that in&s;tant look over in a right line towards the di&s;part, and the &s;troke of the Shot, &s;et up in that place a Pin with a little &s;oft Wax on the Ba&s;e Ring; &s;o this Pin will be in a right line with the di&s;part and &s;troke of the Shot: This being done, level your Piece to the mark a&s;&s;igned by this Pin and the di&s;part, and without que&s;tion you will make a fair Shot; for when you level by the Metal of the Ba&s;e Ring where the Pin is placed, and the mark of the Piece &s;tanding at that direction, look over the top of the di&s;part from the notch in the Ba&s;e Ring, and you &s;hall find it to lye ju&s;t &s;o much to the left, as the former Shot &s;truck to the right, from the a&s;&s;igned mark, which &s;hould in all likelyhood now &s;trike the mark.</P>
<P>But if a Shot be both too wide and too low, then you mu&s;t u&s;e both the directions above taught, to make the next Shot: fir&s;t regulate the di&s;part by cutting it &s;horter, according as the Shots mark is lower than the a&s;&s;igned mark; when this is done, then proceed to my directions to mend &s;hooting wide, and the&s;e things performed with care and diligence, cannot choo&s;e but mend a bad Shot.</P>

<P>FOr the effecting of this matter, we mu&s;t have a Quadrant with a Thread and Plummet (which is de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t Chapter of this &s;econd Section) to one &s;ide of this Quadrant; &s;o that one end of the Ruler may go into the Cavity of the Piece, and let a Piece of Lead be fa&s;tned to the end of the Rule, to make it lye clo&s;e to the bottom of the Metal within, the Quadrant hanging without, and the Plumb-line &s;waying or hanging down from the Center of the Quadrant, perpendicular to the Ho|rizontal line; for the Quadrant being thus placed, you may mount a Piece to what degree you &s;hall find fit to &s;hoot by.</P>

<P>Suppo&s;e you make tryal of your Piece of Ordnance, ac|cording to the method pre&s;cribed in the la&s;t Chapter, and find that at 6 degrees of Random upon a level ground, the Shot is conveyed 619 paces, and you are to ply your Piece again&s;t a place which lyes beyond the point blank, the di|&s;tance being 498 paces, to know the degree the Piece mu&s;t be elevated too, do thus; in this Table of Randoms again&s;t 6 degrees, there is 461 paces; then &s;ay as 619 paces is to 461, &s;o is 498 to 375; which number, or the neare&s;t to being &s;ought, in this Table is 370, and &s;tands again&s;t 4 degrees, but becau&s;e it is not exactly the &s;ame number, you mu&s;t find out the part of a degree or minute, by a Table of proportio|nal parts; but if the mark you &s;hoot at be lower or higher than your Platformer, then you mu&s;t add or &s;ub&s;tract &s;o many degrees or minutes from the degrees and minutes found, and the remainder is the degree you ought to mount your Piece to.</P>
<P>Now that we may be under&s;tood well, we mu&s;t know that there are two &s;orts of Ranges or Motions of a Shot, of which you may &s;ee more in Chap. 20. the one is called the Right Range, and the other is termed the Curved or Crooked Range, and the&s;e two there termed a Compound Range, is called the Dead Range, that is to &s;ay, the whole di&s;tance from your Platform from whence the Shot was made, to the place where the Bullet fir&s;t grazes; yet the perpendicular de&s;cending of the Bullet is al&s;o called the Natural motion, as you may &s;ee by the figure hereafter placed. Captain <HI>Hexham</HI> in his Book of Gunnery, &s;hews how by finding out the Random of a Cannon for the fir&s;t degree of Mounture to find the Random for every degree to 45 de|grees, which is the utmo&s;t Random, after this manner; Fir&s;t, find out how many paces the Cannon will &s;hoot, being laid level by the Metal (which he accounts for one degree of Mounture) divide this di&s;tance by 50, then multiply the Quotient by 11, and that will bring out the number of the greate&s;t digre&s;&s;ion or difference between Range and Range, which being divided by 44, the Quotient will &s;hew the number of paces which the Bullet will loo&s;e in the other Ranges from degree to degree. <HI>Example.</HI> A Battering Cannon being laid by the Metal, will &s;hoot his Bullet (as he &s;aith) 1000 ordinary paces, two foot and a half to each pace; which being divided by 50, the Quotient will be 20, which multiplyed by 11, is 220 paces, which is the number of the next digre&s;&s;ion made in the &s;econd degree: which 220 divide by 44, the number of the remaining degrees yields 5, which is the number of paces to be dimini&s;hed in each degree; and by this Rule this Table is framed.</P>

<P>THe right Range of every Piece being di&s;charged in a level, or parallel to the Horizon, is allowed by &s;ome not to exceed 185 paces, that is 5 foot to a pace, yet &s;ome reckon much more, but then they account ordinary &s;teps or paces of two foot and a half; and Batteries made with &s;uch Pieces are u&s;ually made at 100 or 120 &s;uch paces, at which di&s;tance they do the be&s;t execution.</P>

<P>This Table is rather proportio|nal than real, and doth be&s;t agree with greater Ordnance; but by help of it, working by the Rule of proportion, you may know the Random of any Piece of Ordnance; by fir&s;t (as we have &s;aid before) making one Shot, and mea&s;uring from your Platform that di&s;tance. You may make a Table for your Piece thus,</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a Saker being mounted to 5 degrees, &s;hoot the Bullet 416 paces, how far will it &s;hoot being mounted 10 degrees?</P>
<P>As 722 the Tabular di&s;tance for 5 degrees of Mounture, is to 416 paces the di&s;tance found,</P>
<P>So is the Tabular di&s;tance for 10 degrees of Mounture, 1214. to the di&s;tance required, which will be found to be 699, 5 paces.</P>
<P>Now if you de&s;ire to know how much of the Horizontal line, is contained directly under the right line of any Shot, called the right Range, made out of any Piece at any elevation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, know that in plain Triangles, the violent motion or right line of a Shot is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Hypothenu&s;al, the Angle of Mounture to be the Angle at Ba&s;e; the&s;e are given, and the Horizontal line is the Ba&s;e which is to be found; there the proportion will run thus;</P>
<PB N="78" REF="48">
<P>As the Radius 90 deg. is to the number of paces in a right Range;</P>
<P>So is the Sine Complement of the Angle of Mounture, to the Horizontal Ba&s;e, or the right line which lyes parallel to the Horizon under the way of the Shot.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the violent, crooked, and natural motion or way of a Shot, from the time he is di&s;charged, until it is de&s;cended.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the third and fourth propo&s;itions of the &s;econd Book of <HI>Tartagilia,</HI> his <HI>Nova Scientia,</HI> he &s;heweth that every body equally heavy, as a Shot in the end of the violent motion thereof, being di&s;charged out of a Piece of Ordnance, &s;o it be not right up or right down, the curved Range &s;hall joyn with the right Range, and to the natural cour&s;e and motion betwixt them both, which di&s;tinct motions you may &s;ee in the la&s;t foregoing figure.</P>
<P>In the 17 propo&s;ition of the &s;ame Book, he proveth that every Shot equally heavy, great or little, equally elevated above the Horizon, or equally oblique or level di|rected, are among them&s;elves like, and proportional in their di&s;tance, as the figure following &s;heweth, as A E F is like and proportional in right and crooked Ranges unto H I, and in their di&s;tances or dead Ranges A F unto A I.</P>
<P>And in his 4th and 6th propo&s;itions of the &s;ame Book, he proveth that every Shot made upon the level hath the mixt or crooked Range thereof equal to the Arch of a Quadrant 90 degrees; and if it be made upon an elevation above the level, that then it will make the crooked Range to be more than a Quadrant: And if that be made imba&s;ed under the level, that then the crooked Range thereof will be a Quadrant.</P>
<P>And in his 9th propo&s;ition of the &s;ame Book, he &s;hews, that if one Piece be Shot off twice, the one level, and the other at the be&s;t of her Random at 42 &frac12; deg. Mounture, that the right Range of the length is but the &frac12; of the dead range of the be&s;t Random. He that de&s;ires a further Demon&s;tration of the&s;e Propo&s;itions, may peru&s;e his &s;aid &s;econd Book <HI>de Nova Scientia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The making of a Gunners Rule, which will &s;erve for the elevation of a Piece, which is &s;ometimes better than a Quadrant; and the dividing it into degrees by help of a Table, fitting it for any Piece from 5 foot to 14 foot long.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEcau&s;e the Quadrant cannot be conveniently u&s;ed at all times, e&s;pecially when the wind blows hard, and, being near the Enemies Guns, the Plumb-line is too long before it &s;tands &s;till; to remedy this, the Gunners Rule was invented, the figure hereof is as followeth; it mu&s;t be 12 or 14 inches long, according as the Gun will require, it mu&s;t have a long &s;lit down the middle thereof like the Eye-Vane of a Quadrant or back Staff, the head thereof make circular or a little hollow, as you &s;ee in the figure the In&s;trument is de&s;cribed &s;tanding, at 'tis to be placed upon the Britch of a Piece of Ordnance; in the middle of the &s;mall narrow &s;lit you mu&s;t place a Lute &s;tring or a well twi&s;ted Silk with a Bead running upon the &s;ame to be &s;et to any number of inches and parts, or to &s;uch a degree of the Quadrant, as you mu&s;t mount your Gun unto; and on the one &s;ide of the &s;lit you mu&s;t place a divi&s;ion of inches, and let every inch be divided into 10 parts, and then it will &s;erve for all &s;orts of Guns; but if it be for a particular Gun, then on the other &s;ide you may place the degrees and parts, when you &s;hall find by the length of your Piece, how many inches and parts of an inch goes to a degree; but to u&s;e it with all &s;orts of Ordnance, let it only be divided into inches and parts.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>The u&s;e of this Table in graduating the Rule is very plain; for if your Piece of Ordnance be 8 foot long, and you would mount your Piece two degrees, &s;eek for 8 foot under the title length of the Piece, and in the common Angle again&s;t the length of the Piece under two degrees you will find 3, 36, to make a degree; that is 3 inches and 36 parts of an inch, divided into 100 parts, and to this you may &s;et your Bead.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="49">
<P>The u&s;e of the graduated Rule is thus: having loaded your Piece, and brought your Piece of Ordnance in a right line with your mark, the di&s;part being placed upon the Muzzle Ring, in like manner place your Rule upon the Ba&s;e Ring, and let one &s;tanding by hold it, for the foot of it let it be fitted round to the Gun; &s;o you may be &s;ure to place it right, and you may e&s;timate on its perpendicular well enough; now having before the di&s;tance to the mark you intend to &s;hoot at, and admit you have found it to be 461 paces, and the fir&s;t Shot you made for practice out of that Piece conveyed her Shot at two degrees of Mounture 274 paces; then by our former Rules and the Tables of Randoms, there I find 461 again&s;t 6 degrees, which is the degrees I mu&s;t mount my Piece to reach 461 paces.</P>
<P>Then to find by this Table how many inches and hundred parts of an inch 6 degrees will require, look in the Table above, and find on the left hand in the fir&s;t Column the length of the Piece, and ju&s;t under the degrees (as is afore&s;aid) you &s;hall find the inches and parts of Mounture, to which &s;et your Bead on your &s;tring, that is in the &s;ight, to &s;o many inches and parts as the Table gives; then mount the Piece higher or lower, until you bring the Bead to the top of the di&s;part and mark, all in one line; &s;top then the Piece in &s;uch a po&s;ition with a Coyn, then prime and give fire.</P>
<P>If you will &s;hoot by the Metal of the Piece without a di&s;part, then &s;ubtract the height of the di&s;part out of the inches found by the Table, and to the remainder mount your Piece.</P>
<P>If you have no Quadrant nor a Ruler, and would make a good Shot, look in the Table, and find the length of the Piece and the inches that you ought to rai&s;e your Piece unto, then cut a peece of &s;tick ju&s;t of that length, and &s;et it upon the Ba&s;e Ring, and bring the top of that &s;tick, the top of the di&s;part, and the mark, all in a right line with your eye, and you will make as good a Shot as if you had a Rule and Bead, or Quadrant.</P>
<P>If you will have no di&s;part, take your di&s;part and mea&s;ure it upon the afore&s;aid &s;tick at the Ba&s;e Ring, and from it cut off the length of the di&s;part, and the remainder u&s;e upon the Ba&s;e Ring.</P>
<P>But if the Mounture &s;hould be &s;o &s;mall that the inches of the di&s;part &s;hould be more than the inches an&s;werable to the degrees of Mounture; then cut off from the di&s;part &s;o much as 'tis longer than the other, and place it upon the Muzzle Ring, and bring the upper part of the Ba&s;e Ring, the di&s;part, and mark, in a right line with your Eye, and you will this way make a level with a &s;tick without In&s;trument, as well as if you had Ruler or Quadrant.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How to make a Shot at the Enemies Light in a dark night, and to make at a Company of Hor&s;e|men or Footmen pa&s;&s;ing by, and al&s;o to make a good Shot at a Ship Sailing; and how a Shot lodged in a Piece, &s;o that it will not be driven home to the Powder, may be &s;hot out without hurt to the Piece.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO &s;hoot by night at the Enemies Lights, di&s;part your Piece with a lighted and flaming Wax Candle, or with a lighted Piece of Match, that with your Eye you may bring the Ba&s;e Ring, the fired Match on the Muzzle Ring, and the Enemies Light, in a right line, or mark; then give fire, and you will make a good Shot.</P>
<PB N="82" REF="50">
<P>If you make a Shot at a Company of Hor&s;e pa&s;&s;ing by, take a Piece that will reach the way the Hor&s;e or Foot are coming in a right line, then let your Gun be &s;o loaded with Powder as it may pre&s;ently take fire, and let your Shot be fit for your u&s;e; then take notice of &s;ome Hillock or &s;ome turning cro&s;s way for the mark, and when the Enemy comes near to that way in a right line with your Gun, give fire; but for &s;hoot|ing at a Ship upon the River, you mu&s;t put your Piece to &s;ome eminent mark on the other &s;ide of the River, and when the Head of the Ship &s;hall begin to be between the Piece and the mark, then give fire.</P>
<P>But if by &s;ome mi&s;chievous accident a Shot is lodged in the concavity of a Piece, and there &s;ticks, and will not go home to the Powder, or come out; then the Gunner, to &s;ave his Piece from breaking, mu&s;t imba&s;e the mouth of the Piece, or put it under the line of level, then put in at the Touch-hole fair warm water at &s;everal times, &s;o that it may run out at Muzzle or Mouth of the Piece; and when all the Salt-Peter is wa&s;hed from the Powder, which is known by the ta&s;te of the Water, then let the Gunner clear the Touch-hole, and put in as much Powder as po&s;&s;ible he can, and prime and give fire, and it will &s;erve to draw out the Shot.</P>
<P>But when a Shot hath lain long in a Piece until he is grown ru&s;ty, and &s;o &s;ticks fa&s;t, put &s;trong Vinegar warm into the mouth of the Piece, and with the Rammer &s;trike the Shot until it doth move; then put in Vinegar until it run clear through the Powder and Shot; prime as before, and give fire with good Powder, and if it do not run through after it hath &s;tood three dayes, clear the Touch-hole, prime and give fire.</P>
<P>A man may al&s;o &s;hoot farther than ordinary in one and the &s;elf &s;ame Piece, if the Powder be gently driven home, and wadded accordingly; then the Shot being com|pa&s;&s;ed with Paper, Leather, Oakam, or &s;uch like, to fill clo&s;e to the Powder with a good Wadd, putting after it a Tampion of Cork, and with a Spunge moi&s;ten it with Oyl, annoint the vacant Cylender, and &s;o Barricado the Piece that it may not rever&s;e in the Di&s;charge.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e by way of Dialogue between a Gene|ral and Captain, concerning the A&s;&s;aulting a Town or Work,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>General.</SPEAKER>
<P>HAving brought your Approaches near unto a Town or a Fortre&s;s, whe|ther would you choo&s;e a Bulwark or a Curtain to be battered with your Ordnance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Town may be a&s;&s;aulted in divers places; &s;ometimes you a&s;&s;ault one &s;ide, when as you make your Battery on another; &s;ometimes you choo&s;e a Bulwark, other|whiles a Curtain to be battered, with this intention, to take in the Town as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible may be. As for me, if I were to take in a great Town which is populous, I had rather choo&s;e to batter a <HI>Curtain,</HI> than a <HI>Bulwark,</HI> which hath a high catt, or mount upon it: e&s;pecially, &s;eeing that in great Towns the Bulwarks lying one far from another, they do &s;how the skirt of the Curtain very open.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why would you rather choo&s;e a Curtain than a Bulwark?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e your Bulwarks are alwayes &s;tronger, and better fortified than your Curtain, and being it is the principal &s;trength of a place, and better furni&s;hed with Platforms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lanks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will require more time, labour, and charge to batter, than your Curtain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><PB N="83" REF="50">Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what General is &s;o ill experienced, as to labour to batter a Curtain, having two &s;trong Bulwarks on both &s;ides of him, to flanker him when he is to put over his Gallery, and to give an a&s;&s;ault upon the Curtain: peradventure for his labour and pains, he may be well beaten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soft (Good Sir,) Suppo&s;e that after a great deal of labour and pains you have battered a Bulwark, and falling up to the breach to a&s;&s;ault it, you find it cut off, an Enemy lodged in it, mu&s;t you not then begin to &s;ap forward again, to make a new batte|ry? whereas on a Curtain there is not that means of cutting it off, as upon a large Bulwark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you ever &s;een the experience of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes Sir, the Prince of</HI> Orange <HI>took in the</HI> Bo&s;ch <HI>by a Bulwark, and al&s;o</HI> Breda, <HI>but</HI> Ma&s;trick <HI>was taken in by making a breach, and &s;pringing of a mine, upon the Curtain between</HI> Jonger <HI>Port and a Bulwark;</HI> how&s;oever the Town of <HI>Cortes</HI> upon the frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> was fir&s;t battered by the <HI>Arch-duke of Au&s;tria</HI> upon the point of a Bulwark, near unto the very joynt of the Curtain, where a high and a &s;trong turret &s;tood, which did annoy us much, &s;o that we could not advance forward, but were con&s;trained to leave off our approach on that &s;ide, and began to make a new Battery for a breach in a Curtain on the Field-&s;ide, where there lay a &s;trong Bulwark to defend it, which did our men a great deal of harm; but how&s;oever, with great difficulty and much ado, we took in the Town that way, by lodging our &s;elves in the Curtain. Likewi&s;e the City of <HI>Cambray</HI> was battered, and taken in upon a Curtain, for all there were two &s;trong Bulwarks that flankered it, which if we had run our line upon a Bulwark, we &s;hould not have forced it &s;o &s;oon; yea &s;uch an occa&s;ion might pre&s;ent it &s;elf, that a Ge|neral may be forced to batter both the one and the other, or to find out &s;ome &s;ecret way by undermining a wall, and blowing it up with powder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is for your great Towns; but what &s;ay you to a Ca&s;tle, a Cittadel, or &s;ome narrow Fortre&s;s, how will you go to work to take in tho&s;e with the be&s;t ad|vantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for your Forts, and Ca&s;tles, it is much better to batter them upon a mount or a Bulwark, than upon a Curtain: my rea&s;on is this, that in the&s;e your Bulwarks lying clo&s;e one by another, will flank one another with the greater force, and hide the Curtain much better to defend it, &s;o that one cannot &s;o ea&s;ily force it, if the &s;aid de|fen&s;es be not taken away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go to then; a Town then being to be battered, either upon a Curtain or a Bulwark, how many Pieces of Ordnance would you have to do it, and, how and in what manner would you place, and plant your Ordnance upon your batteries to make a good breach?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>To effect this, I would have 18 Pieces of Canon and half Canon, <HI>(for le&s;&s;er Pieces for Battery are now grown out of u&s;e.)</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether would you choo&s;e more whole Canon or half Canon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>To batter a place well either upon a &s;tony or earthy wall, you may a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, the more whole Cannon you have, the greater and the more &s;ufficient your breach will be: for your great battering Pieces do &s;poil and beat down any thing, which doth meet with their great force and violence: <HI>How&s;oever of late years expe|rience hath taught at divers Seiges that your half Canon which are more portable, having good &s;tore of them, will do the bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;well as your whole Canon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But at what di&s;tance would you make your Batteries, for the&s;e 18 Pieces of Canon, and how near unto the place, which you intend to Batter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would coun&s;el a General to approach as near unto that place as po&s;&s;ible may be, and make his Batteries &s;ome two or three hundred paces one from another, and that if it were po&s;&s;ible to advance covertly the Approach and &s;ap, even up to the Counter-&s;charfe, and very brink of the Moat, to prepare a way for his Gallery: not only to Batter that place being at hand with the greater force, but al&s;o to keep in, and hinder an Enemy from Sallying out upon the Be&s;iegers, to di&s;cover and di&s;mount their Ordnance in <HI>Ca&s;emates,</HI> or if they have &s;unk any in their Walls or Fal&s;e-bray, and &s;o to terrifie them, that they dare not &s;tir out.</P>

<P>I am al&s;o of your opinion, and hold it for good, yet I fear this will not be &s;o &s;oon done, and is &s;ooner &s;poken, than executed, and that before you can bring your approach and &s;ap &s;o far, it will co&s;t you warm blood, and a great many mens lives, if you have a &s;tout Enemy within to deal withal, and one that is very Vigilant, and careful to &s;tand upon his Guard, and his defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, this cannot be done without danger, and the lo&s;s of men, but he that is fearful mu&s;t &s;tay at home, and not come into the Wars where there is neither place nor time, which doth free or exempt him from danger: yet the danger is not alwayes &s;o great, e&s;pecially in &s;uch places, where you have Earth enough to work with, to ca&s;t up your &s;apps, and to heighten and deepen your Approaches, which will &s;how you the way, for the more higher you find the ground in Approaching to the edge of the moat, the deeper Trenches you may make, and cover your &s;elf by ca&s;ting up of blinds continually, to keep you from the &s;ight of the Be&s;ieged; and it is better, when you have brought your approach as it were under them, than if you were 200 or 300 paces di&s;tant from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you Good Sir, how would you plant, and divide the&s;e 18 Pieces of Canon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would make a great Battery with 8 of them to beat upon a right line, either upon a Curtain, or the point of a Bulwark (which the General &s;hall find fitte&s;t) Two Batteries with each 3 Canon to play &s;lope-wi&s;e from the great Battery; as the ninth plate and 28 and 29 figures &s;hows, and two Batteries, with two half Canon a Piece, to play as it were cro&s;s-wi&s;e upon the breach. And thus you &s;ee your 18 Pieces planted upon 5 Batteries, as you may ob&s;erve in the 9th. Plate, and the two Figures of a Curtain and of a Bulwark following.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Sir tell me I pray you how many &s;hot will the&s;e 18 Pieces of Canon make in 10 hours, and how much powder will they require.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>In 10 hours they may make &s;ome 1500 &s;hot, and will require a matter of 25000 pound weight of powder, that is 150 barrels full, each barrel containing 160 pound weight in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make your account then that every Piece in the &s;pace of 10 hours is to &s;hoot 80 &s;hot, that is 8 &s;hot an hour for every Piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may make 10 &s;hot in an hour if you plea&s;e, if your Pieces be renforced; but as for your ordinary Pieces, they have not metalline &s;ub&s;tance enough to bear it: con&s;idering al&s;o that after you have made 40 &s;hot out of a Piece, it will be &s;o heated, that it mu&s;t have a cooling time, which mu&s;t be at lea&s;t an hour, for otherwi&s;e your Piece being grown over hot, it may cau&s;e danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks that 80 &s;hot for a Piece in &s;o long a time were too little, having often heard, that in that while, a Piece may well be &s;hot off 130 times; can you give me your re&s;olution upon this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you Sir what hapned once in the I&s;land of <HI>Bomble,</HI> Anno 1599. we planted a Piece by a mill, by which we did annoy the Enemy very much, &s;o that they were forced to make a Battery, and planted a whole Canon, and a demy-Canon upon it, &s;eeking to di&s;mount ours. Now &s;hooting with this Piece from four of the clock in the morning, till eleven toward noon, this Piece had a cooling time the &s;pace of two hours, and about one of the clock we began to play with it again, and continued &s;hooting with it till 4 a clock in the afternoon; but this Piece being not able to endure the force and heating of &s;o many &s;hot, we were con&s;trained to leave off with it: and yet cea&s;ed not &s;hooting with our other Pieces from another Battery by command from <HI>Don Lewes de Vala&s;co,</HI> General of our Ordnance, and &s;hooting cro&s;s-wi&s;e with &s;ome other of our Pieces, we put the Enemies two Pieces to &s;ilence in the &s;pace of an hour; a Souldier of ours &s;tanding by, was curious to keep a tally of the number of all the &s;hot we made from the morning till four a clock in the afternoon, and &s;hewed me 80 notches, which deducting the two hours cooling, our Piece planted at the Mill made 8 &s;hot in an hour, which was as much as could be required of it.</P>
</SP>
<Q>Senior <HI>Diego Uffano</HI>give your Tran&s;lator leave to interrupt you a little, and &s;o to conclude this di&s;cour&s;e. If you remember at the Seige of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> which you mention ofttn
<PB N="85" REF="51"> in your Chapters and Dialogues, you were without, and I was within the Town, that on the &s;eventh of <HI>January, Anno 1602. Stilo Novo,</HI> After Sir <HI>Francis Vere</HI> of famous memory (who defended and kept the Town again&s;t you) had deluded you with a <HI>Parley,</HI> only to gain time, and to make up our Canon and Sea-beaten works along the skirt of the old Town, his Highne&s;s the Archduke re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault us, and that morning began to batter <HI>Sand-hill</HI> and <HI>Schotenburgh,</HI> to make a breach for you again&s;t that night, with intent to A&s;&s;ault us (as you did) and to have entred the Town, and have put us all to the Sword, the Relation whereof you &s;hall hear in the end of this Book. Now you had placed and planted your 20 Pieces of Cannon to batter them in this manner, 8 from your Battery at the foot of the <HI>Downs, 8</HI> from a Battery on the right hand of the <HI>Downs,</HI> 6 from your pile Battery, 6 more which you had made upon the Sand, and as it were rai&s;ed out of the Sea: the fir&s;t &s;hot upon the breach in a right line, and the other two &s;lope|wi&s;e, as your two figures following do demon&s;trate. The&s;e 20 Pieces of Canon towards noon had a cooling time, for a matter of &s;ome 2 hours, ju&s;t as you have &s;aid; and afterwards you began to batter the breach and old Town again, till it was almo&s;t twilight, and then they cooled again, till you were ready to give us an a&s;&s;ault; and before you fell on, as I do well remember, you &s;hot off one of your Cannons with a hollow Bullet, which flew over the Town and made a great humming noi&s;e, as a warning Piece to the <HI>Count of Bucquoy,</HI> who lay on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, that you were then ready to fall on, and that he &s;hould do the like, this was your Signal. Now <HI>General Vere</HI> knowing well your intent, gave order to the Gentleman of our Ordnance who had the guard upon <HI>Sand-hill,</HI> that he &s;hould keep a true Tally, and an account of all the &s;hot you made that day, with your 20 Pieces of Cannon upon the breach and the old Town, which being ca&s;t up, there were found to be made that day from morning till night 2200 &s;hot, which was found to be an 110 &s;hot for every Piece, and 11 &s;hot an hour for every Piece, which is more than 8; but I verily believe your Pieces were renforced. <HI>This by the way, and &s;o I return again to your own Dialogue.</HI></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Good Sir) I pray &s;how me how you would batter the point of a Bulwark (as the figure 28 following demon&s;trates,) and give me &s;ome rea&s;ons a&s;wel defen&s;ive as offen&s;ive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing to give your Lord&s;hip content, and &s;ay, If I were to batter the point of a <HI>Bulwark</HI> or a <HI>Ba&s;tion,</HI> I would have the &s;ame number of battering Canon, and planted in the &s;ame form and manner as they were for the Curtain, and to &s;hoot &s;loap and cro&s;s-wi&s;e al&s;o; and if your approaches were advanced &s;o far, they &s;hould be planted upon the very brink of the moat and upon the <HI>Counter&s;charfe,</HI> I would plant 4 of them &s;o, that they &s;hould di&s;mount the Enemies Canon in their <HI>Ca&s;emates,</HI> or any, if they had &s;unk them in their <HI>Fal&s;ebray,</HI> which &s;hould wait upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of your mind, and prefer &s;uch a battery before all others, who are of the opinion that they had rather choo&s;e a Curtain than a Bulwark to be battered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have heard my rea&s;ons for that, and &s;ee the figures following traced out to you. But as for your <HI>Bulwark</HI> the <HI>be&s;ieged</HI> may cut it off (as you may mark in the figures of <HI>Retrenchments</HI> and <HI>Cuttings off</HI> in the &s;econd part of this book) for indeed it will be a hard matter to force an Enemy out of a Bulwark, who is re&s;olved to loo&s;e it by peecemeal and degrees; and there is not &s;o much danger in a&s;&s;aulting of a Curtain, which being once well battered and beaten down with your Ordnance, you have an ea&s;ier way and entrance to fall on with your Troops of men, to enter the Town or Fortre&s;s; but for the defence which is made from your Flanking Bul|warks, or your Ca&s;emates, you mu&s;t make Batteries upon the brink of the moat again&s;t them, (as is &s;aid) to di&s;mount the Enemies Pieces, and to flanker with your Ordnance the Parapets of the Bulworks to beat them about their ears, that the Bul|works may lye the more open to you, and I think this way is the lea&s;t danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Be&s;ieged, their cuttings off, may they not be made a&s;wel upon a Cur|tain as upon a Bulwark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, for the Rampire being thinner, you have neither &s;o much ground, nor the like accommodation in a Curtain as in a Bulwark; and indeed, a Governour
<PB N="86" REF="52"> of a Town, or of a Fortre&s;s, if he were put to his choice, had rather to be a&s;&s;aulted on a Bulwark (than on a Curtain) by cutting it off into the form of a half moon, that he might make a new re&s;i&s;tance, and defend it with a le&s;s number of men. Be&s;ides, in a Bulwark the Be&s;ieged have this advantage over the A&s;&s;ailants, which is very dangerous for them, that they may make a Mine within the bowels of their Bulwark when an Enemy &s;hall attempt to a&s;&s;ault it, and thinking to enter the Breach and take the Town, they may be blown up into the Air by a Countermine; the like al&s;o may happen to the Be&s;ieged, the A&s;&s;ailants &s;pringing their Mine al&s;o in a Bulwark, when they think they &s;tand upon their be&s;t defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>May not the like be done al&s;o in a Curtain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it will not take the like effect as in a Bulwark; for a Breach being once made in a Curtain, for as an Enemy may a&s;&s;ault it at large, &s;o they may bring a greater number of men to fight, to help to defend it; whereas in a Bulwark they are pen'd up and &s;traightned in a narrow place, which may be cut off, and will require a fewer number of men to defend it, whereas tho&s;e which are to force it, mu&s;t be con&s;trained to bring up a great many men to a&s;&s;ault, who in an in&s;tant may be in danger of blowing up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your rea&s;ons (Good Captain) are not to be &s;lighted; but as for me, I hold it &s;afer, to batter and a&s;&s;ault the breach of a Bulwark, than of a Curtain. For though the be&s;ieged may cut it off, and defend it with a fewer number of men, yet the A&s;&s;aulters have this advantae over the Be&s;ieged defendants, that they have more place and elbow room, and may find a le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance than in a Curtain, &s;eeing that one may make as a great a breach in a Bulwark as in a Curtain, becau&s;e your Ordnance may beat it flat, and level with the ground; and choo&s;ing rather a Bulwark: I will herewith conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, and now &s;hew you the figures both of the one, and of the other in this following plate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing the demon&s;tration of Morters, and the u&s;e of them.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOur great and &s;mall Morters, are not only &s;erviceable in a War offen&s;ive, by &s;hooting and ca&s;ting of great Granadoes, as of 100, 150, 170 pound weight, and &s;maller of 40, and 50 pound; but al&s;o by ca&s;ting of Fire-balls, Stones, old Rubbidge, and Pieces of Iron, into Cities, Towns, and Fortre&s;&s;es; and may be u&s;ed al&s;o defen&s;ively, to be &s;hot from Towns and Forts into any Enemies works, and approaches; e&s;pecially they are of &s;ingular u&s;e, when an Enemy hath covertly ap|proached, and lodged him&s;elf under &s;ome Bulwark, Tower, or Turret, and is a be|ginning to undermine them; which if they do, you may plant one of the&s;e Morters at a rea&s;onable di&s;tance, on the in&s;ide of your Wall, and &s;hooting your Granado, as it were bolt upright into the air, by its natural fall, it may light ju&s;t into the Ene|mies works, and there with great violence breaking among them, it will make them cry, fly, and for&s;ake the place; you may al&s;o fire them out of a place, by ca&s;ting good &s;tore of Hand Granadoes down among them, and &s;o annoy them, that the work will be too hot for them.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e Morters are repre&s;ented unto you, in the Plate and Figures follow|ing number. Now for the &s;hooting a way of your great Granadoes or Fireballs, you mu&s;t ever remember, but to take &frac15; or 1/7 parts of fine Powder of the weight of your
<PB REF="53">
<PB N="87" REF="53"> Granado or thing which you &s;hoot; but if you are to &s;hoot away a Bullet without any Fire-works in it, or &s;ome ma&s;&s;ie &s;tone, or &s;uch like &s;olid thing, then you mu&s;t take but half the weight of it in fine Powder, which, having given fire to the Morter, will &s;end it going merrily.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of them is not to &s;hoot in a right line, as other Ordnance do, but in an oblique line, as you may &s;ee by the two Figures following, unle&s;s your Morter be mounted to 90 degrees, mounting them u&s;ually above 45 degrees, namely to 60, 70, 80, and &s;ometimes more or le&s;s, as the di&s;tance and fall of your Granado or Shot &s;hall require.</P>
<P>Having before &s;hown you the making and u&s;e of the Quadrant, it remains now that I come to the charging and u&s;e of a Morter; now before you put in your Pow|der. it mu&s;t be well &s;ponged and cleared, whether you charge it with loo&s;e Powder, or Cartouch, turning the mouth almo&s;t bolt upright; the Powder being put into the Chamber, you mu&s;t &s;top it with a Wadd either of Hay or Oakam, and after a Tampkin of &s;ome &s;oft wood, and this with the Powder that was put in fir&s;t, it mu&s;t fill up the whole Chamber thereof, that there may be no vacuity between the Powder and the Wadd, or between the Wadd and the Shot; this done, the &s;hot &s;hall be put in at the mouth, with another Wadd after it; but you mu&s;t have a care that your Morter be not much mounted, le&s;t your &s;hot flyes out too &s;oon, and the Wadd between the Tampkin and the &s;hot will not only &s;ave the &s;hot from the Tampkins breaking of it, but al&s;o is to avoid vacuities which may endanger the breaking of the Piece by &s;econd expan&s;ions.</P>
<P>Now then having re&s;olved of the premi&s;&s;es, touching your Piece, Shot, and Powder, as above&s;aid, and upon the di&s;tance and mounture of your mark, as the Rules and Tables following &s;hall direct you, then for the bending and di&s;po&s;ing of it to the a&s;&s;igned mark; lay fir&s;t a &s;traight Ruler upon the Mouth of your Morter, and upon it place a Quadrant (as you may &s;ee by the Figures) or &s;ome other In&s;trument cro&s;s-wi&s;e, to &s;et the Morter upright, for &s;huning of wide &s;hooting, and then placing them fore-right to elevate it into the re&s;olved degree of Mounture, to avoid &s;hort or over&s;hooting, accordingly as the Tables following will teach you; for having made one &s;hot, you may thereby proportion the re&s;t, con&s;idering whether you are to &s;hoot with or again&s;t the wind, or whether it blows towards the right or the left hand, whether weakly or &s;trongly, and &s;o accordingly to give or abate the advan|tage, or di&s;advantage, which judgment and di&s;cretion will induce you thereunto, and the help of the Rules following.</P>
<P>Now we will come to the u&s;e of a Morter, and that in this example following; Suppo&s;e an Enemy be approached to the <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> or foot of a Wall or a Bulwark, and there is a rooting, and begins to make a Mine, and having Chambred his Powder, intends to blow it up, and that there is no other means left you, to repul&s;e and hinder their egre&s;s and regre&s;s into it; but by &s;hooting out of your Morters &s;ome Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Stones, and Rubbi&s;h among them, or at lea&s;t by ca&s;ting many Hand-Granadoes down upon them. To do this either by force or policy, it behoveth a good Canonier or Fire-worker, to know fir&s;t (as hath been taught) how far his Morter will carry a Granado, or any &s;olid thing el&s;e, which &s;hall be &s;hot out of it, being &s;et upon &s;uch and &s;uch a degree and elevation as the Morter Figure will &s;hew you. As for Example, take your aim level with the mould or mouth of your Morter, noted A upon the Quadrant, and it will carry 200 paces, where you &s;ee the Granado falls upon the letter A; but your morter being elevated to the mark B, it then will carry its Bullet 487 paces; if to the &s;econd C, then 755 paces; if to the third D, it will carry 937 paces; if to the fourth E, then 1065 paces; if to the fifth elevation F, then 1132 paces; if to the &s;ixth G, which is in the mid&s;t of the Quadrant, and lyes then upon its highe&s;t elevation, it will carry 1170 paces, as you may &s;ee by the &s;everal falls of the Bullets upon every Letter. The &s;econd Figure &s;hews you a Morter ca&s;ting a Granado upon a Ca&s;tle, as you may &s;ee by the Example.</P>

<P>_THe number of artificial Fire-works which are practi&s;ed as well in Armies upon Land in the attacquing and defence of places, as in defence of Ships at Sea, whereby warlike Executions may be performed, are many and various, according to the ingenuity of the Fire-Ma&s;ter: And the wayes of preparing them are &s;o many, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for us in this room we have allotted to pre&s;cribe all that are known. We &s;hall therefore be contented to make choice of &s;ome of the be&s;t and principal things among &s;o great a number, but more particularly of &s;ome mo&s;t admirable inventions; and we &s;hall give a Chapter to every kind of Fire-work, con&s;idering they differ among them&s;elves both in fa&s;hi|on and effect, and every one hath its name which is particularly applyed to it. But before we begin with our compo&s;ition we &s;hall begin with the particulars, and their preparation unto this work, whereby they may be the more exalted, and have the grea|ter efficacy. The more principal materials, that is, Peter, Charcoal and Sulphur, are mentioned at large in my fir&s;t part of Gunnery, and therefore we &s;hall proceed.</P>

<HEAD>To prepare Oyl of Sulphur.</HEAD>
<P>TAke a good quantity of clarified Sulphur, (the way of Clarification we have &s;hewed before) melt it over a very gentle fire in an Earthen or Copper Ve&s;&s;el, then take old red Tyles that have been already u&s;ed in buildings, or if you cannot find &s;uch, take new Tyles that are well baked, and that have not taken dirt, break them in pieces as &s;mall as a Bean, and throw them into melted Brim&s;tone, then min|gle your Brim&s;tone with the remaining fragments of the Bricks, until they have drank up all the Sulphur, then let them be put into a Limbeck upon a Furnace to di&s;til, and after the Oyl is drawn according to a Chymical order it will be very excellent, and aboveall, have a very combu&s;tible quality, proper to the Compo&s;itions of artificial fires.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To prepare Oyl or Bal&s;am of Sulphur.</HEAD>
<P>Fill a long body of Gla&s;sfull of Sulphur well powdered, then pour upon it Oyl of Turpentine, or Oyl of nuts, or Juniper, in &s;uch a quantity that the oyl with the Sulphur may fill but the half part, place it in an Iron Kettle; with Sand round about it, and a &s;mall heat for 8 or 9 hours, and you will &s;ee that the Oyl of Tur|pentine will convert the Brim&s;tone into a red Oyl, as fiery and combu&s;tible as before.</P>
<P>There are tho&s;e that take the following matter to the preparing the oyl of Sulphur, to the end it may be rendered more combu&s;tible, <HI>viz.</HI> Sulphur 1 <HI>l.</HI> of quick Lyme half a pound, of Sal-armoniac 4 ounces.</P>
<P>Above all this, the Chymi&s;ts know how to prepare a certain oyl of Sulphur, (which they call a Bal&s;am) of which the virtues are &s;o admirable, that they admit not any body, either living or dead, to be touched with putrification, but will con&s;erve it in &s;o perfect and entire &s;tate, that neither the pernicious Influences of the cele&s;tial bodies, nor that corruption which the Elements produce, nor that which reduces things into their Principles, can any way damnifie it, if anoynted with it. There is al&s;o from it prepared a certain fire (as <HI>Tritemius</HI> teacheth) with flowers of <HI>Sulphur, Borax</HI> and <HI>Brandy-wine,</HI> which will remain many years without extingui&s;hing of it &s;elf. Others that are knowing, do atte&s;t that a Lamp may be filled with &s;uch like Oyl, from whence all that are within the Light of it, will appear as if they had no heads.</P>
<P>There is another way of making Oyl of Sulphur which is very admirable and ex|cellent, which is prepared thus. Incorporate well together an equal proportion of Sulphur and Salt-Peter, reduce them into mo&s;t &s;ubtile Powder, and pa&s;s it through a fine &s;ieve, then put them into an Earthen Pot that hath never been u&s;ed, and pour upon them Vinegar made of <HI>White-wine</HI> or <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> as much as will cover the Pow|der; Clo&s;e the Pot in &s;uch manner that no air may any wi&s;e enter, and put it thus in any hot place &s;o long time until all the vinegar be dige&s;ted and vani&s;hed. La&s;tly, take that matter which re&s;ts in the Pot, and draw from thence an oyl, by Chymical In&s;tru|ments proper to this work.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TAke Benjamin a certain quantity of ounces, put it into a Gourd or a Limbeck gla&s;s, and clo&s;e it well with a blind head (as they call it) then have in readi|ne&s;s an earthen ve&s;&s;el, &s;et it upon a Tresfoot, or for the more certainty upon a &s;mall Furnace, place it in your gla&s;s body, and compa&s;s it well about with fine Sand or a|&s;hes &s;o high as the matter is in the gla&s;s; after make a moderate fire under it, for fear the Limbeck heat too &s;oon, and be too hot, for that will make the flowers become citrine or yellow, when they ought to be as white as Snow. Ob&s;erve when you &s;ee the flowers begin to rai&s;e a vapour or &s;mall fume, continue your fire in that &s;ame de|gree the &s;pace of one quarter of an hour; after you &s;hall &s;ee the flowers ri&s;en unto the internal Superficies of the blind head, then take it away carefully, and put to it another that &s;hall be quite cold, and put that which you have taken off upon a white paper until it be cold, then gently with a Feather or wooden Spatula, cau&s;e the flow|ers to come forth of the blind head, and gather them together carefully: thus you may add a third or fourth blind head, and in time many, until all the Benjamin cea&s;e to fume.</P>
<P>Benjamin may be made into flowers another way, thus; put into a glazed pot a certain quantity of ounces of Benjamin, and place it upon warm a&s;hes, and when you &s;ee it begin to fume, cover the ve&s;&s;el with a Cornet of paper made in the form of a Cone, and a little larger than the orifice of the pot, leave it there about one quar|ter of an hour, after take off the Cornet, and take the flowers and gather them to|gether; then put upon the ve&s;&s;el another Cornet of paper, and let it &s;tand as long as before; take it off, and gather the flowers to the former, and continue thus putting Cornet after Cornet, until your flowers be entirely evaporated.</P>

<P>I do add to all this, that it may be ea&s;ie to reduce Camphire into Powder, to make it u&s;eful in artificial fireworks, if a man crumbles it and beats it gently, rouling it with Sulphur.

<P><HI>Of the Shooting of Shot made red hot in the Fire.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is practice that hath been practi&s;ed in former times to &s;hoot red hot Fire-balls, and was counted of great defence, as you may find among&s;t many other things in the Works of <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> where he &s;ayes, <HI>Tyrios immi&s;&s;e in Alexandri Magni machinamenta ma&s;&s;as ferreas candentes:</HI> Out of many Authors may be proved the cu&s;tomary u&s;e in former times of Shooting red hot Pieces of Iron., which we &s;hall not dwell upon, but come to the Practice. Fir&s;t, you mu&s;t Charge the Piece of Ordnance according to the cu&s;tomary manner, his due proportion of Powder, upon this Powder you mu&s;t put a Wooden Cylender or Fidd, of a ju&s;t and equal widene&s;s with the bore of the Piece, which mu&s;t be driven very &s;tiff home to the Powder, and for your better &s;ecurity, you mu&s;t put upon this another wad made of Straw, Hay, or of Oakam, or Tow; this being done, let the Piece be laid a little under Metal, and then clean&s;e the vacant place or hollow of the Piece with a Spunge, &s;o that all the Grains of Powder that are there, may be taken away. This being done, lay your Piece to bear with the place you intend to &s;hoot at, according to the method we have given in the &s;econd Part of Gunnery, and let your Piece thus remain until you have put in your red hot Bullet: your Bullet mu&s;t be &s;ure to be exactly round, and not &s;o high, but that it may run freely down in the Piece to the wad, the Shot being red hot, take it out of the fire with a pair of Tongs made for that purpo&s;e, and put it into the Piece, and give an attentive Ear, for as &s;oon as the Shot is &s;uppo&s;ed to be up to the Wad, give immediately Fire to your Piece of Ordnance.</P>
<P>There are others which put into their Pieces Boxes made of Plate, of Iron or Cop|per. Others do put into their Pieces Potters Clay, and upon them the fiery Bullet, which with a quick hand they thru&s;t home with a Rammer, which ought to be defend|ed from fire by lining the Rammer head with Copper. But the&s;e are more perillous; and therefore we account that method above to be the be&s;t, and mo&s;t free from danger.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the many defects in Fuzees, how they may be avoided, and of &s;uch things as ought to be ob&s;erved in their good Con&s;truction.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe fir&s;t and mo&s;t notable defect which is ob&s;erved in Fuzees, is that after they are lighted or ri&s;en into the Air the height of 1, 2, or 3 Perches, they break, and do di&s;&s;ipate without making their entire effects.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, which is little better, is after it is remaining &s;u&s;pended upon the nail it con&s;umes but very lei&s;urely, without going away or rai&s;ing it &s;elf in the Air.</P>
<P>The third is, when they are rai&s;ed in the Air, they de&s;cribe only an Arch of a Circle like a Rainbow, and return upon the earth again before the Compo&s;ition in the Fuzee be con&s;umed.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="69">
<P>The fourth is when it moves in a &s;piral manner, whirling in the Air without ob|&s;erving an equal motion; that is not right as it ought to be.</P>
<P>The fifth is when it mounts &s;loathfully and negligently, as if it di&s;dained or refu&s;ed to elevate it &s;elf into the Air.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth and la&s;t is, that the Ca&s;e or Cartouch remains hanging upon the Nail quite empty, and the Compo&s;ition doth ri&s;e and di&s;&s;ipate alone into the Air. There is many other vexations and inconveniencies which may give trouble to the Practitioners in the&s;e Arts with vain expence, which would loo&s;e too much time to repeat: It will be &s;ufficient if you take notice of the&s;e which are principal, whereby, if by ill fortune you be faln into any of the&s;e defaults, you may correct your error ea&s;ily, and then immediately correct tho&s;e faults. And for this purpo&s;e, ob&s;erve the rules given in the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Infallible Rules by which you may make Fuzees, or Rockets, without any default.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FIr&s;t, that they have their height proportionable to the Diameter of their Orifice, as we have before declared.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Cartouch ought to be of wood, or glued or pa&s;ted paper, not too thick, nor too thin.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they ought to be made of &s;trong paper of indifferent dryne&s;s, properly rouled and well compacted clo&s;e upon the Former.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the necks ought to be bound about very &s;trongly and firm, in &s;uch a &s;ort, that the knot of the thred, and the folds of the Cartouch, may not lye ami&s;s one upon the other.</P>
<P>Fifthly, all the Materials of the Compo&s;ition mu&s;t be exactly weighed according to the proportion of the Orifice of the Fuzee that you would charge, and al&s;o well beaten and &s;ifted particularly; after, having weighed them again, and mixed them in one body well together, you mu&s;t pound them again, and pa&s;s them through the Sieve as you did before.</P>
<P>Sixthly, that the Salt-Peter and Sulphur be powdered and clarified as much as po&s;&s;ible may be, and the Coal perfectly well burned and exempted from all humidity, and made of wood that is light and &s;oft, as the Teile, the Hazle, and the branches of the Willow Tree; and on the contrary, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to have a care, that you make not u&s;e of &s;uch Coals as are made of Birch, Oak, nor Maple, becau&s;e they contain in them much weighty and terre&s;tial matter.</P>
<P>Seventhly, matters for Rockets or Fuzees ought to be prepared immediately before they are intended for u&s;e, and not before.</P>
<P>Eighthly, the matters of Compo&s;ition ought to be neither too dry nor too moi&s;t, but moi&s;tned a little with &s;ome Oliganious matter, or with a little Brandywine.</P>
<P>Ninthly, there mu&s;t be put into the Cartouch alwayes an equal quantity of the Compo&s;ition at a time, and &s;o beat it down alike; and thus do until it be filled.</P>
<P>Tenthly, you mu&s;t beat the Compo&s;ition alwayes with the Rammer right up, or perpendicularly, and take care that in the beating it be not made crooked.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, You mu&s;t &s;trike down the Compo&s;ition with a wooden Mallet, that is of heft proportionable to the bigne&s;s and thickne&s;s of the Rocket, and alwayes with an equal &s;trength, and ju&s;t number of &s;troaks, every time you put in any of the Com|po&s;ition.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="70">
<P>Twelfthly, in Cartouches made of paper, you mu&s;t put in round peeces of wood hollowed; but in tho&s;e that are made of wood, you mu&s;t put &s;uch as are &s;mooth, without any channel or hollowing, to the end that it joyn the better to the &s;ides of the Fuzee, where it mu&s;t joyn firmly, as well without as within.</P>
<P>13. The Fuzee mu&s;t be peirced with a Bit or Awl that is convenient, in &s;uch a &s;ort that the hole be not too big nor too &s;traight, nor too long nor too &s;hort.</P>
<P>14. The hole mu&s;t be made the mo&s;t &s;treight and perpendicular that may be po&s;&s;ible, and ju&s;t in the middle of the Compo&s;ition, to the end that it lean nor to any one &s;ide, more than to the other.</P>
<P>15. The Fuzee mu&s;t not be peirced before it be intended for u&s;e, and after it is pierced you mu&s;t handle it tenderly, only with the ends of your fingers, for fear of deforming it.</P>
<P>16. The Pearch or Stick to which you fa&s;ten the Fuzee, ought to be proportio|nable as well in length as weight; it mu&s;t not be crooked nor winding in any manner, neither unequal, nor full of knots, but &s;treight as po&s;&s;ible can be made, and mu&s;t therefore be made &s;mooth, and &s;treightned with a Plain, if need requires.</P>
<P>17. After they are Charged, they mu&s;t not be laid into too dry a place, nor in a place too moi&s;t, for the one or other of tho&s;e accidents may hurt them; therefore let the place be temperate.</P>
<P>18. When you would u&s;e them and put them into action, hang them upon a nail perpendicular to the Horizon.</P>
<P>19. You mu&s;t not think to rai&s;e a bundle of a great weight, or that has too great a di&s;proportion to their &s;trength, you mu&s;t adjoyn them together &s;o rightly, that all together may have a proper form, and rea&s;onable to pa&s;s into the Air, and to elevate it &s;elf on high without any difficulty, and in &s;uch a &s;ort, that tho&s;e bundles may not by any means give hinderance or &s;toppage to their ri&s;ing in a &s;treight line; and take care mo&s;t exactly that the Fuzee be not &s;o big, but that they may retain as near as you can a Pyramidal or Conical form, when all its weight that may be is adjoyned to it.</P>
<P>20. Men ought to &s;hun as much as po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e nights that are rainy, moi&s;t, and when the Sky is darkned with black clouds, as being very incommodious and offen|&s;ive to the Fuzees. And more than that, avoid impetuous Stormy winds, and the Whirl-winds hinder no le&s;s than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>21. You may not reject above other cau&s;es, the different effects which are pro|duced by &s;undry Fuzees (although they be charged with one and the &s;ame Compo|&s;ition) no otherwi&s;e than thus, that they were not made with an equal diligence either in the Charging or Peircing, or in the other Circum&s;tances, which you were obliged to ob&s;erve; or in this, that it may be &s;ome may have been kept in a more moi&s;ter place than the others, where they have acquired too much moi&s;ture, which cau&s;eth to them, effects much different one from another, as well in Ri&s;ing as in Con&s;uming.</P>
<P>22. If you would make appear in the Air &s;treams of fire, or a quantity of burning &s;parks or &s;tars, or long large rayes to dart from the Fuzees; there is ac|cu&s;tomed to mix with the Compo&s;ition &s;ome &s;mall quantity of powdered Gla&s;s gro&s;ly beaten, filings of Iron, Sawdu&s;t. One may al&s;o repre&s;ent fire of divers colours, as we have &s;hewed before in the fifth Chapter; but more particularly thus; if you put a certain portion of Camphire in your Compo&s;ition, you will &s;ee in the Air a certain fire which will appear, white, pale, and of the colour of Milk; if you put Greek Pitch, which is a light yellow Pitch u&s;ed in Plai&s;ters, called <HI>Pix Burgundy,</HI> it will repre&s;ent unto you a red flame, and of the colour of Bra&s;s; if you put in Sulphur, the fire will appear blew; if Sal-Armoniack, the fire will appear Greeni&s;h; if from Crude Antimony, the flame will be Red, Yellowi&s;h, and of the Colour of Honey; if the filings of Ivory be added, they will render a Silver-like, White and &s;hining flame, yet &s;omething inclining to a Livid Plumbous colour; if the powder of Yellow Amber be added, the fire will appear of the &s;ame colour, with the Citrine; la&s;tly, if black Pitch be added, it will throw forth an ob&s;cure &s;moaky fire, or rather a &s;moak that is black and thick, which will darken all the Air.</P>

I have al&s;o &s;hewed the way of making them up, and their u&s;e, and al&s;o I have &s;hewed the manner of giving to them various Colours, as in the 22 Rule of the 13 Chapter, where I had an intent to &s;ay no more of the&s;e things: But finding in Ma&s;ter <HI>Cazimier</HI>'s Artillery the&s;e Compo&s;itions, which I judge may prove very excellent; therefore I thought good to in&s;ert them, that I might leave out nothing that might make more perfect any thing we treat of.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, you mu&s;t know that between fiery Sparks and Stars there is this diffe|rence, that the Stars are greater, and are not &s;o &s;oon con&s;umed by the fire as the Sparks are, but do &s;ub&s;i&s;t longer in the Air; and do &s;hine with greater &s;ub&s;tance, and with &s;uch a light, that by rea&s;on of their great &s;plendor, they are in &s;ome manner comparable with the Stars in the Heavens. They are prepared according to the fol|lowing Method.</P>
<P>Take Salt-Peter half a pound, Sulphur two ounces, Yellow Amber powdered one Dram, Antimony Crude one Dram, of beaten Powder three Drams. Or,</P>
<P>Take Sulphur two ounces and a half, Salt-Peter four ounces, Powder &s;ubtilly powdered four ounces, Olibanum, Ma&s;tick, Chri&s;tal, Mercury &s;ublimate, of each four ounces, White Amber one ounce, Camphire one ounce, Antimony and Orpi|ment half an ounce; All the&s;e materials being well beaten and well &s;ifted, they mu&s;t be mixt together with a little Glue or Gum-water, made with Gum-Arabick or Tragacant; then make them into &s;mall Balls about the bigne&s;s of a Bean or &s;mall Nut, which being dryed in the Sun, or in a Pan by the fire, may be kept in a convenient place for &s;uch u&s;es as we have &s;poken of in the fifth Chapter of this Book. You mu&s;t only remember, that when you would put them into Rockets or Recreative Balls, they mu&s;t be covered on all &s;ides with prepared Tow, of which we have &s;hewed the way of preparing in the &s;eventh Chapter of the fir&s;t Part of our Fire-works.</P>
<P>Sometimes Fire-Ma&s;ters are accu&s;tomed to take in the places of the&s;e little Balls, a certain proportion of melted matters, of which we have &s;poken in the fir&s;t Part of Fire-works; But if the&s;e do not plea&s;e you, by rea&s;on of their &s;warthy colour, but you rather de&s;ire to &s;ee them yellow, or inclining &s;omewhat to white, then take of Gum-Arabick or Tragacant four ounces, powder it and pa&s;s it through a Sieve, of Camphire di&s;&s;olved in <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> two ounces, Salt-Peter a pound and a half, Sulphur half a pound, Gla&s;s gro&s;&s;y powdered four ounces, White Amber an ounce and a half, Orpiment two ounces, make all the&s;e Ingredients into one ma&s;s, and make Globes of them as before. I Learned this, &s;aith my Author, from <HI>Claude Midorge.</HI></P>
<PB N="25" REF="71">
<P>For the method of making Sparkles in particular, it is thus; Take Salt-Peter one ounce, of this Liquid matter half an ounce, of beaten Powder half an ounce, of Camphire two ounces; after you have beaten all the&s;e materials into powder, every one by it &s;elf, put all of them into an Earthen Pan, and put upon them the Water of Gum Tragacanth, or Brandy-wine, wherein you have di&s;&s;olved &s;ome Gum Tragacanth or Arabick, until it be of a good con&s;i&s;tency; that done, take an ounce of Lint, which has fir&s;t been boyled in Brandy-wine or Vinegar, or in Salt-Peter, and after dryed again, and the threads drawn out; then put it into the Compo&s;ition, and mix them well together, &s;o well and &s;o long until it has drank up all the matter; of the&s;e Compo&s;itions make little Balls in the form of Pills, and of the bigne&s;s of great Peas, which you mu&s;t roul in mealed Gun-powder, and dry them, whereof you may &s;erve your &s;elf, according to the method we have pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are certain odoriferous Pills prepared, which are employed in &s;mall Engines and fiery Inventions, which are &s;hewed in Chamber Roams, or clo&s;e Cabinets, the&s;e are commonly prepared of Storax, Calamite, Benjamin, Amber, white and yellow, and of Camphire, of each one ounce, Salt-Peter three ounces, of Coals made of the Teil Tree four ounces; beat all the&s;e Ingredients to powder, then incorporate them well together, and moi&s;ten them with Ro&s;e Water, in which is di&s;&s;olved Gum-Arabick or Tragacanth, to make thereof little Balls; at la&s;t, having fa&s;hioned them, expo&s;e them to the Sun or to the fire to dry.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="75"> this is the <HI>Parabola</HI> &s;ought. For the directive line of this <HI>Parabola</HI> is AI, &s;eeing that it toucheth the <HI>Parabola</HI> in A, for EG, or AD, is double to FG by con&s;tru|ction; and therefore DG, and GI are equal: wherefore AI is the Tangent to the <HI>Parabola.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I &s;ay, that this <HI>Parabola</HI> is de&s;cribed by the <HI>Impetus</HI> given; for AE, EF, and EB, or tho&s;e three lines equal to DG the Altitude, GF the Semi-ba&s;e, and GL are in continual proportion. Wherefore GL is the &s;ublimity, by the V. Propo&s;i|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">De metu Projecto|rum.</NOTE> of <HI>Galiaeus,</HI> and its Corollary.</P>
<P>Then thus: the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the <HI>Parabola</HI> AG in the point A, is as much as that of the Cadent naturally falling from L to D, (by X. of <HI>Galiaeus)</HI> that is, from B to A, or of the Project a&s;cending from A to B: therefore the <HI>Parabola</HI> hath in the point A the <HI>Impetus</HI> that was given: wherefore that is done which was required.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e this Propo&s;ition is of great moment, for clearing of tho&s;e that follow, we will prove it another way.</P>
<P>Let the &s;ame <HI>Impetus</HI> A, B and the &s;ame direction AFC be given: the <HI>Parabola</HI> made by this projection is &s;ought, de&s;cribe as before, a Semicircle about the Diameter <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines and angles</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> AB, which &s;hall cut AC: &s;eeing that AD is a Tangent. Let it cut it in F, and drawing the Horizontal line EFG, &s;o as that EF and FG may be equal, de&s;cribed, or conceive a <HI>Parabola</HI> to be de&s;cribed along by the points A and G about the Dia|meter GD. I &s;ay, that this is the <HI>Parabola</HI> of the Project, if it be thrown from the point A, accord|ing to the Direction AC, with the <HI>Impetus</HI> AB. Now if the moveable do not run along this &s;ame <HI>Parabola</HI> it will run along &s;ome other; as &s;uppo&s;e A P: let the Vertex, or the highe&s;t point of this <HI>Parabola</HI> AP be found, and let it be P.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is manife&s;t that the point P cannot be in the line LD; becau&s;e &s;ince the line AC toucheth each <HI>Parabola,</HI> that ID the common <HI>Axis</HI> &s;hould be cut into two equal parts in two points by the Vertex's of the <HI>Parabola,</HI> is ab&s;urd. Nor can it be in the line EG: for drawing the Diameter, &s;uppo&s;e MN, thorough the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">rtex, that MN &s;hould be cut into two equal parts by the line EG, is ab&s;urd: for only ID, of all the lines parallel unto it in the angle CAD, can be cut into two equal parts.</P>
<P>Now let the point P fall any where at plea&s;ure, and draw the Horizontal line PR: for as much as PN and PM are equal, by the II of * this, NR and RA, PR and RS <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which &s;e|cond Pro|po&s;ition is, that the &s;ub|lime point of the Range of any Pro|ject <HI>[P]</HI> doth cut the Perpendicular <HI>[M]</HI> intercepted betwixt the Horizon and line of direction, into two equal parts.</NOTE> &s;hall be equal.

<HEAD>COROLLARIES.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t, Hence is manife&s;t, that the <HI>Impetus</HI> of <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a parabola inscribed by various angles</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> any Machine being given, as for example EA, if there be de&s;cribed about EA the Semicircle ADE, one may a&s;&s;ign the Alti|tudes and the Amplitudes of all the proje|ctions that can be made by the &s;ame Machine. For example; the <HI>Impetus</HI> EA remaining &s;till the &s;ame, let projections be made along the lines of &s;everal elevations AC, AD, and AB. The projection made according to the dire|ction AC, &s;hall a&s;cend as high as to the Ho|rizontal line FC prolonged: and the pro|jection made along the direction AD, &s;hall have its Apex in the line HD prolonged: and of the projection made according to the line AB, the greate&s;t Altitude &s;hall be in the Horizontal line GB prolonged.</P>
<P>2. In the Book of <HI>Galilaeus de motu naturaliter accelerato,</HI> it is proved, that projects thrown with the &s;ame <HI>Impetus</HI> out of A, if born up by plains of &s;everal incli|nations, do alwayes arrive unto one and the &s;ame Horizontal plain. But here it ap|peareth, that the &s;everal a&s;cen&s;ions of projects do vary when they are thrown thorough the pure Air, without any fulciment put under them, according to &s;everal elevations. For the moveable &s;hall le&s;s a&s;cend, which is emitted along the line AB le&s;s elevated, than that which &s;hall be projected along AD more elevated.</P>
<P>3. It is manife&s;t al&s;o, that no Altitude can in &s;uch &s;ort a&s;cend, as that it may reach unto the Horizontal parallel that is drawn thorow E the highe&s;t point of the perpen|dicular projection.</P>
<P>4. It is al&s;o manife&s;t, that all Amplitudes do alwayes encrea&s;e from that pro|jection which is called the point blanck Randon, until you come to the projection made at the Semi-right Angle. And from the Semi-right unto the perpendicular, they alwayes dimini&s;h until they come to nothing; which hapneth in the perpendicular projection, which hath no Amplitude.</P>
<P>5. From whence we may ob&s;erve, that the Amplitudes of each <HI>Parabola</HI> made by the &s;ame <HI>Impetus,</HI> the elevations of which are equi-di&s;tant from the Semi-right, are equal to each other. For, &s;ince the lines AB and AC are equi-di&s;tant from the Semi-right elevation, the Arches DB and DC <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a parabola inscribed by various angles</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> &s;hall be equal, as &s;ubtending equal Angles: and con&s;equently the BA and CE, the remainders of their Quadrants &s;hall be equal: therefore al&s;o the Sines of them, BG and CF, &s;hall be equal. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the whole Amplitudes of each <HI>Parabola,</HI> which are Quadruple to the Sines BG and CF, &s;hall be equal.</P>
<P>6. It is manife&s;t likewi&s;e that the Altitudes and Sublimities of projections equi-di&s;tant from the Semi-right, are reciprocally equal to one another, that is, the Altitude of the one is equal to the &s;ub|limity of the other.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="76">
<P>7. We will therefore make a Corollary of that which to <HI>Galilaeus</HI> was an arduous Theorem, to wit, that the Semi-right <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Randon.</NOTE> projection is the greate&s;t of all tho&s;e made by the &s;ame <HI>Impetus.</HI> For, if you &s;uppo&s;e the Angle CAD to be Semi-right, CD &s;hall be the Semi-Diameter; that is the greate&s;t of all the Sines that can be given in the Semi|circle.</P>
<P>8. It is manife&s;t al&s;o, that the whole Amplitude of the Semi-right <HI>Parabola</HI> is double to the line of the Sublimity, or the <HI>Impetus</HI> AB: for it hath been demon&s;trated to be Qua|druple of the right line CD, that is double to AB.</P>

<HEAD>The u&s;e of the Precedent TABLE.</HEAD>
<P>SUppo&s;e that the greate&s;t Range, namely the Range made at the elevation of the &s;ixth point of the Quadrant by a Culverin, be, for example, 4000 Geometrical paces, I de&s;ire with the &s;ame Piece to make a &s;hot in &s;uch manner that its Range may be ju&s;t 2360 paces long. I take the fourth part of 2360, which is 590, and I look upon the Table, and find again&s;t that Number, that the elevation to be given to the &s;aid Piece is 18 Degrees and 5 Minutes, or Gr. 71. and Min. 55, its Complement. And I &s;ay, by the things demon&s;trated, that the forementioned Piece with one of the&s;e two Elevations, &s;hall carry the Ball 2360 paces di&s;tance above the Horizon. But tho&s;e Elevations which exceed the &s;ixth point of the Quadrant, are not in&s;erted for the u&s;e of * Artillery, but only for Morter-Pieces, Rams, and Granadoes. It is to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">That is, all long Pieces.</NOTE> noted, therefore, that with that &s;ame fir&s;t Elevation the Ball will make a low Range, <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a high, arcing parabola inscribed by a lower, flatter one</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> but &s;wift, as the line marked A, and with a great Horizontal <HI>Impetus,</HI> pro|per to make breaches in Walls, or give other lateral impul&s;es. But with the other Elevation it &s;hall de&s;cribe the Range B, which &s;hall be &s;low in its Horizontal motion, but with &s;uffi|cient perpendicular <HI>Impetus</HI> at the la&s;t, proper to batter Vaults, Roofs, and to make other breaches perpendicular to the Horizon; or to ca&s;t things to any determinate mark. as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>v. gr.</HI> little Baggs im|baled with Cord, full of Sulphur, Salt-Peeter, or Meal, or Balls with Letters or other things within them. In a word, both tho&s;e Elevations that are equally di&s;tant from the &s;ixth point, will carry the Ball unto the &s;ame place: but yet with this difference, that with the fir&s;t and lea&s;t Elevation it &s;hall fall to the Earth (as Gunners &s;peak) Grazing; and with the &s;econd and greater Elevation, it &s;hall de&s;cend almo&s;t plumb, or perpendicular.</P>
<P>I know that its very &s;eldom, and perhaps never found, that the greate&s;t Range of a Piece of Ordnance is ju&s;t tho&s;e 4000 Paces, as it &s;eemeth to have been &s;uppo&s;ed in the Calculating of our Table, and al&s;o in tho&s;e of <HI>Signiore Galileo,</HI> &s;o that the &s;aid Table might &s;eem unu&s;eful: but we &s;hall &s;hew, that the &s;uppo&s;ed number of 4000 doth not therefore &s;erve to any great particular Machine, to the end it might &s;erve to all in general. It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore to take notice, that that &s;ame &s;uppo&s;itious Number of 4000, is not of Paces, or of Ells, or of Yards, or of any other determinate mea&s;ure, but of ab&s;tracted parts, &s;uch yet, whatever they are, as being convertible into any kinds of po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ures, they do make the Table general, as well for the Culvering, as for the Mortar-Piece or Cro&s;s-Bow. And to give an example how it may be adapted and applyed to all the Species of Artillery, and how the Ab&s;tract parts may be reduced into Geometrical paces, we will do thus.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Range of a Canon, by experiment made thereof, is found to be &s;uppo&s;e 2300 paces; and I would with the &s;ame Piece make a &s;hot that &s;hould be 860 paces, I do thus: If the greate&s;t Range 2300 give 860, I ask what the number 1000, the greate&s;t of the Table will give? I work and find 374: which number being &s;ought in the Table, is found to be betwixt 370 and 380. Therefore taking the part proportional according to my Judgement, I find the Arch of its Elevation ought to be <HI>Grad.</HI> 11. very near, or its Complement <HI>gr.</HI> 79. And thus it is cer|tain,
<PB N="9" REF="78"> that that &s;ame Piece which being mounted to &s;ix points did carry 2300 paces. being elevated <HI>gr.</HI> 11. or 79. of the Quadrant, &s;hall carry 860 paces, as we did de&s;ire.</P>

<P>Say, if as the Right Sine 86602 of the Angle A C E, <HI>gr.</HI> 60. that is, of the Complement of the Elevation, is to the &s;ide A E, which is 600: &s;o is the whole Sine 100000 to a fourth number 693: and thus the Hypothenu&s;e A C &s;hall be 693 Paces.

<P>But with much more brevity, and at one &s;ingle working, we may perform the &s;ame thus.

<P>It is to be noted, that great Guns are not alwayes u&s;ed &s;o as that the Ball goeth to determine in the &s;ame Horizontal plain from which it did depart, as <HI>Galileo</HI>'s and our Tables do &s;uppo&s;e. Therefore being to &s;hoot upon the &s;ide of a Hills declivity or acli|vity, as al&s;o being to &s;hoot from the &s;ummity of a Rock upon the Horizontal plain that is below, there hath no mans as yet reduced the mea&s;ures of the&s;e Ranges to an Art.

<P>But when from the point A it is required to &s;hoot downwards by a de&s;cending Hill, as AB, we &s;hall find the quantity of the Range AB, that is, the place where the Ball falleth, in this manner. Let the direction AE, that is, let the angle of the Pieces Elevation be given; al&s;o let there be given the angle of the Hills inclination CAB. Let us imagine the Horizon to be AC, and let us draw BE and HDF perpendiculars to the &s;ame: and conjoyn or draw a line from C to H, which line &s;hall be parallel to AE. Now upon the Table of Amplitudes we &s;hall find how many paces AD is, but we &s;eek the quantity of AB. Therefore make the calculation thus; as FD the Tangent of the angle of the Pieces Eleva|tion is to DH, the Tangent of the inclination of the plain; &s;o is AD, known in paces, to a farther number. And this &s;hall be the mea|&s;ure of DC in paces; and thus the whole line AC &s;hall be known in paces.

<P>Let the Direction of the Piece be the Line AB, and the Horizon AC, and the Wall of the Tower DE perpendicular to the Ho|rizon: and let the di&s;tance AD be known in paces. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the Ball pa&s;&s;eth freely without hitting the Wall, and falleth upon the Horizon in C. The Table of the Amplitudes giveth the quantity of AC, but we &s;eek the Altitudes DE. Draw CB per|pendicular to the Horizon, and DF parallel to AB, and then draw a line from F to A, which &s;hall pa&s;s thorow the common Section of the <HI>Parabola,</HI> and of the Wall, as may be collected from the things already demon|&s;trated. Now &s;ay, as CA the length of the Horizontal line is to CD the difference be|twixt the lines AC and AD already known, &s;o is BC the Tangent of the angle of the Ele|vation of the Piece, to CF the Tangent of the angle FAC. Again &s;ay, as the Sine Total is to AD known in paces, &s;o is the la&s;t found Tangent of the angle FAC to a fourth number: which &s;hall be the de&s;ired mea&s;ure of the right line DE in paces. And thus we
<PB N="13" REF="80"> have found the point E in which the &s;aid &s;hot would &s;tick. The &s;ame calculation may be al&s;o deduced. Although the Wall DE be not perpendicular, but &s;carfed, as tho&s;e of the modren Fortre&s;&s;es; but fearing to procure you more trouble than bene|fit, I will refer the care of that to the Geometrician that hath a mind to under|take it.</P>
<P>The Amplitudes of the <HI>Parabola</HI>'s, of which <HI>Galileo,</HI> and al&s;o we do treat, &s;uppo&s;e that the Range terminates not upon the plain of the Field, but in that Horizontal plain that pa&s;&s;eth by the Muzzle of the Piece. The other is only true when the Peice is placed with its Carriages in a Trench, &s;o that the mouth of the Piece lyeth exactly level with the ground. But becau&s;e this is not u&s;ual, and becau&s;e the Ranges do determine in the Horizon that toucheth the lower parts of the Wheels, we will Geometrically enquire how much a level Range, or Horizontal Range may be prolonged by means of the Altitude of the Muzzle of the Piece above the plain of the Field. It &s;eemeth that the Se|midiameter of the wheels, and the thickne&s;s of the Metal do cau&s;e the Muzzles of ordi|nary Artillery to be above the Horizontal Site about two Braces. I &s;uppo&s;e therefore the Muzzle of the Culvering to be at A. and let the Horizon be BC; and let the Altitude of the Muzzle be the right line AB, &s;uppo&s;ed to be two Braces; and let the Range ACD be the level Range. The right line BC is &s;ought; let the Semirect Range, or the be&s;t of the Randon of the &s;ame Piece, be the <HI>Parabola</HI> AEF; and let it be &s;up|po&s;ed that AF be 5000 Geometrical paces, that is a 15000 Florentine Braces. De|&s;cribe the u&s;ual Semi-circle of the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition AHI, and having drawn AL equal to AI apply LD. The right line AI, by the things demon&s;trated, &s;hall be the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the <HI>Parabola</HI> AEF, or of ACD (for they are Ranges of the &s;ame Piece) therefore AL &s;hall be the fourth part of the right &s;ide of the <HI>Parabola</HI> ACD: there|fore LD &s;hall be double of LA: but AF hath been demon&s;trated to be al&s;o double of AI; therefore LD and <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabolas, angles, and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> AF are equal; and there are three lines given, that is, LA 7500. LD 15000. and AB 2. And therefore, working by the Rule of three, as the right line LA is to AB known; &s;o is the &s;quare of the right line LD to another number: we &s;hall find 60000; whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;hall be the &s;quare of the right line BC; and extracting the Square root thereof, we &s;hall find the line BC to be 245 Braces. We conclude therefore that that Machine which ma|keth its greate&s;t Range of 15000 Braces, in ca&s;e it &s;hall have its Muzzle rai&s;ed above the Horizon, will make its level Range, that is, without any Elevation or Mounture, to be in all 245 Braces long. Next, how much every other Range not level, but inclined upwards or downwards, by occa&s;ion of the Altitude of the wheels, or of a Ba&s;tion, or of a Mount, or of any other &s;cituation that rai&s;eth it above the Horizontal plain, may be prolonged, &s;hall be found thus.</P>
<P>It is certain, that being to &s;hoot from the top of a Rock, or of a Ca&s;tle placed in the top of an Hill, or from any whatever high place above the Horizontal plain of the Field that lyeth below, the Ranges will prove much longer than tho&s;e noted upon the Table of Amplitudes; and this difference &s;hall be &s;o much greater, by how much the &s;citu|ation of the Artillery &s;hall be higher above that Horizontal plain in which Balls are to hit, and the Rangers to determine.</P>

<P>Let the height of the Hill or other place be G F, and from the point F, let a line be drawn upon the plain of the Field G E: and let us &s;uppo&s;e the Horizon to be F B: now having made the Range F C B E at an Elevation, the mea&s;ure of G E is &s;ought.</P>
<P>By the Table of Amplitudes, we find the quantity of A B, and by the Table of Altitude, we find A C, the height of the <HI>Parabola.</HI> And for the working of the Computation, it may be performed &s;undry wayes.</P>
<P>Let the number of A B be &s;quared, and divide that &s;quare by A C, and the <HI>Quotus</HI> &s;hall be the right &s;ide of the <HI>Parabola</HI> F C B: Then multiply that <HI>Quotus</HI> by C D, and the &s;quare Root of the Product &s;hall give D E.</P>
<P><HI>Or we may work thus:</HI></P>
<P>Draw the number D C into C A, and the &s;quare Root of the product &s;hall be the mean proportional betwixt D C and C A. Then &s;ay, as C A is to the fore-mentioned Root, &s;o is A B to another number. And this fourth number &s;hall again be D E.</P>
<P><HI>Or la&s;tly, in this manner:</HI></P>
<P>Say, as the number C A, the Altitude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> in the Table, is to the num|ber C D, the Altitude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> and Range together, &s;o is A B the Semi-Ampli|rude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> in the Table to another fourth number.</P>
<P>Then take the number that is mean-proportional betwixt that la&s;t number and A B, for that mean-proportionall &s;hall give you the &s;aid D E. And for as much as D G, equal to A B is known, the whole line G E &s;hall be known.</P>
<P>But &s;ome might alleadge, that from the Mount G F, it may perhaps be required to play with Guns oftner downwards than upwards; therefore it would be nece&s;&s;ary to know by a Geometrical Rule, the length of Ranges, which is done in this manner. Let the Range to be made downwards be that marked F H, with any whatever angle of inclination beneath the Horizon: G H is &s;ought. Imagine with your &s;elf that the Range is to be made above the Horizon with the &s;elf &s;ame inclination; and by the precedent Rules, the quantity of D E is found as above, or D H, from which if we take the part already known F A, or D G, there &s;hall remain known the quantity required G H. But if <HI>gr.</HI> 40 being given for the Elevation of the Range A B C, and the Ba&s;e A C 1600 Paces, we would know all the different Altitudes of the Ranges of the Ball upon any point of the line A C, work thus: Having divided A C in the <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled parabola and lines</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> mid&s;t, and erected D B, this &s;hall be the Su|pream Altitude, and &s;hall be found in the Table of Altitudes and Amplitudes working in this manner. In the Table of Amplitudes right again&s;t <HI>gr.</HI> 40. of Elevation, I find the line A D to be 9848 parts: but in the Table of Altitudes I find the line B D to be 4132 parts. Then, by the Rule of Three, I &s;ay; if A D 9848 give 800 paces according to the &s;uppo&s;ition, how many paces &s;hall D B, which is 4132 parts, give? and I find, that the right line B D is 336 paces. Now let any point be propo&s;ed, as E, over which you would know the Altitude of the Range of the Ball, that is the line E H. Let the right line A E be &s;uppo&s;ed 1000, and E C 600: and work the Rule of three again, in this manner. If the &s;quare of A D,
<PB N="15" REF="81"> which is 640000, give the Rect-angle of the right lines A E and E C which is 600000, what &s;hall the number B D (which was found to be 336) give? and I find 315 paces. Therefore the Altitude of the <HI>Parabola</HI> over the point E, was 315 paces; which is that that was &s;ought.</P>
<P>It &s;hall &s;uffice to have hinted this little for the Calculating of &s;ome varieties that may happen about the&s;e Ranges. Other ca&s;es may be put, like to the&s;e, and particu|larly tho&s;e of their conver&s;ions; but from the knowledge of the&s;e, tho&s;e may ea&s;ily be deducted: and the Ingenuity of any Geometrician, applying him&s;elf thereto, &s;hall find le&s;s difficulty in re&s;olving many of the&s;e Problems of him&s;elf than in under|going the length and ob&s;curity of our explanations.

<HEAD>Of the Quadrant.</HEAD>
<P>LEt us now come to practice; and by help of an In&s;trument, let us re&s;olve &s;ome of the Propo&s;itions above demon&s;trated. We will make a Military Quadrant, which with invariable certainty &s;heweth (at lea&s;t to Geometrical Philo&s;ophers, if not to practical Gunners) what Mounture or Elevation ought to be given to any Piece, to the end that the length of the Range may prove to be of &s;uch a certain mea&s;ure. We will al&s;o re&s;olve, by help hereof, all Problems that can be framed about the &s;hooting of Artillery, which were heretofore promi&s;ed by <HI>Tartaglia,</HI> and reduced into Tables by <HI>Galileo,</HI> with &s;omething over and above. Military Indu&s;try did find that the u&s;e of a Machine &s;o noble, and of &s;o great con&s;equence as the Canon, would be too much confined, and of too little benefit, if it could not be made u&s;e of &s;ave only at that &s;mall di&s;tance to which it carrieth a point blank, or in its level Range, without giving it with the Quadrant the advantageous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome elevation. It was therefore enquired how a man might do that with the &s;ame Piece, which of it &s;elf did not carry more than 200 or 250 Geometrical paces, he might &s;hoot 400 and al&s;o 600 paces, and more and more, until he come to the length of the greate&s;t Range that can be made by that Piece. The Invention was thus: They began to help the Piece by Elevation, that is, they directed it not &s;traight upon th' object which it was to hit, but, holding it in the very vertical of th' object, they elevated it above that right line which goeth from the Piece unto the object: and this they did &s;ome|times more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s, according as the force of the Shot was to be greater or le&s;&s;er: An Artifice that from the very beginning of the world hath been known even to artle&s;s Boyes. We &s;ee that when they with a Ball of Snow, or other matter, do aim to hit a mark that is very near, they throw it directly at the mark: but being at another time to aim at one which &s;tandeth farther off, or being to throw Stones at each other, they do not throw Horizontally, or directly at their Adver&s;aries, but turning the ca&s;t half way into the Air, without having ever had any other con&s;ide|ration, they do all throw at the elevation of the fifth, and al&s;o of the &s;ixth point of the Military Square to them unknown: But Gunners, in proce&s;s of time, have found an In&s;trument, that doth with facility mea&s;ure the&s;e Elevations.</P>
<P><HI>Nicolo Tartaglia</HI> of <HI>Bre&s;cia,</HI> a famous Mathematician, did invent a Square with unequal &s;ides joyned together with the Quadrant, which hath for more than a hundred years pa&s;t, been generally u&s;ed, and is &s;till the only Regulator of Gunners, not only to manage great Guns, and to rai&s;e them to tho&s;e Mountures which they call Randons, but al&s;o to level them in the Point-blank Ranges; <HI>Tartaglia</HI> divided that Quadrant into 12 equal parts, beginning the Numeration of them from the le&s;&s;er [or &s;horter] &s;ide; he al&s;o &s;ubdivided each of tho&s;e into other 12 equal parts, naming tho&s;e fir&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="82"> Points, and the&s;e &s;econd Minutes of the Quadrant. We will in&s;ert the figure of the Quadrant, and &s;hew how it mea&s;ureth the Elevation [Mounture or Randon] of the Piece.</P>
<P>Let the Canons * Soul be A B, fixed at &s;ome certain Mounture: put into the Muz|zle <NOTE PLACE="marg">Her Con|cave, Ci|linder, or Bore.</NOTE> thereof the greater of the Quadrant C A: &s;o that it be applyed to the lower &s;ide of the &s;aid Soul, and let the Plummet fall in D. I &s;ay that the Angle E C D, that is the <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>quadrant measuring an angle</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> arch E D, is the mea&s;ure of the Elevation of the Piece. Draw an Ho|rizontal line A F, the angles at the point G &s;hall be right: But the angle A C F is al&s;o right. There|fore the angles C A F, and F C G are e|qual by the 8 of the &s;ixth of <HI>Euclid.</HI> Or thus; Draw thorough C the Horizontal line. If H I now from the right angles H C D and A C E there be taken the common part A C D, there &s;hall remain th' Angle E C D of the Quadrant, equal to the angle of the Piece under the Horizon H I, or above the Horizon A F, which is the &s;ame as being alterne.</P>
<P>By the help of this Quadrant Gunners have with long ob&s;ervations compo&s;ed &s;uch a <HI>Praxis,</HI> as that they know how many points they are to mount <HI>v. gr.</HI> a Culvering of 40 pound Ball to hit a mark di&s;tant; for example, 700 Geometrical paces, or at any other di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But the truth is, the ob&s;ervations are &s;o &s;allible, and the Gunners &s;o few that have made them, and made them exactly, that the u&s;e of Artillery, taking from it the Range of Point Blank, mu&s;t needs have very little of certainty in it.</P>
<P>If one would collect &s;ome certain Science touching th' ordinary Quadrant, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to make the Experiments not only with all &s;orts of Balls, and with all the varieties of Powder, but in all kind of Pieces, as al&s;o in all tho&s;e that being the &s;ame <HI>in &s;pecie,</HI> are of different grandeur; and la&s;tly, at all po&s;&s;ible degrees of Elevation. A Multiplication that almo&s;t runs up into infinity. And we ob&s;erve that the&s;e Expe|riments ought to be all made one by one; for it is not true, that by way of proportion one may from three or four Ranges of a Canon made at &s;everal elevations, argue to any others, no not of the &s;ame Canon, laden with the &s;ame Powder and Ball. That this is &s;o, may be demon&s;trated by help of the Tables made by <HI>Signiore Galilaeo,</HI> and by us. For example, That Canon which being elevated at the &s;ixth Point, curryeth its &s;hot 4000 paces, elevated at one Point, ought to curry the &s;ixth part, at two points the third, and at three points the half of that Range. But the thing falls out far otherwi&s;e: For being elevated to one point, it curryeth 1032 in&s;tead of 666, which is the &s;ixth part of that &s;ame greate&s;t Range 4000: at the &s;econd point (and note that with this Mounture, Pieces carry alwayes the half of the greate&s;t Range) in our ca&s;e will curry 2000 in &s;tead of 1333, which is the third part: At the third point it will curry 2824, in&s;tead of 2000, which is the half of the greate&s;t Range: at the fourth point it will curry 3464 in&s;tead of 2666: At the fifth point it will curry 3860, in &s;tead of 2333, which are 5 &s;ixths of that greate&s;t Range: See therefore how that increa&s;ing equally the Mountures of the Piece, that is &s;hooting fir&s;t at one point only, then at two, three, four, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unto the &s;ixth, the increa&s;es of the lengths of the Ranges do not increa&s;e equally, that is with the &s;ame proportion wherewith the

There|fore to derive &s;ome rule from the Experiments, it were nece&s;&s;ary to make them exa|ctly, at all the Grades of Randons, in all &s;orts of Pieces, with all varieties of Powders, and different matters of Balls; and happily one might &s;ay, it were nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o that every Gunner made them by him&s;elf. Things almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to reduce unto Rules, from which any certainty might be gathered, if the Theorick and Geometry had not given us a manife&s;t Science thereof, by means of that one &s;ole Propo&s;ition of <HI>Galileo,</HI> in which fir&s;t of all men he hath adverti&s;ed and taught us, <HI>That Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ects do all move in a Parabolical Line.</HI> Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition we will ground the In&s;trument promi&s;ed: and though by the impediment of the <HI>medium</HI> the <HI>Parabola's</HI> become too deformed, or by many other accidents the Ranges prove very incon&s;tant, yet it &s;uffi|ceth us to have given indubitable &s;atisfaction to the School of Mathematicians, if not to that of Gunners.</P>
<P>Before we &s;et down the making of our &s;quare, which con&s;i&s;teth only in de&s;cribing one &s;ingle Semi-circle, we will divide the ordinary Quadrant into unequal points, &s;o as they may not mea&s;ure the Randons of the Piece, but the lengths of the Ranges, which is that that &s;erves to our purpo&s;e. Thus we &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured, that the Gun, if it &s;hall be elevated to one point of the &s;aid Quadrant, &s;hall carry to &s;uch a di&s;tance, whatever it be: and elevated to two points, &s;hall preci&s;ely double that Range: and if to three, it &s;hall carry three of tho&s;e &s;paces; if to four and a half, it &s;hall carry four and a half; if to five and a quarter, it &s;hall carry five and a quarter; and thus until you come to the &s;ixth point, &s;hall the points of the Quadrant in the In&s;trument, and the &s;paces of the Ranges in the Field, alwayes increa&s;e in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame proportion, and from the &s;ixth to the twelfth point, they &s;hall go in the &s;ame manner decrea&s;ing. The con&s;truction and demon&s;tration is Geometrically taken from the propo&s;ition which we have made the Fir&s;t of this our Book of Projects, which by the Amplitude given, teacheth us to find the Elevation. And it &s;erveth in common for what&s;oever &s;ort of Artillery and Mortar Pieces, and for any &s;ort of Ball or Powder.</P>
<P>Let the &s;ides of the Quadrant be A B the greater and A C the le&s;&s;er; then making A the Center, de&s;cribe the Quadrant C D E, upon which the unequal points are <FIGURE>

</FIGURE> to be marked or &s;et off: and about the Diameter A C draw the Semi|circle A F C; and having drawn F G perpendicular to A B, and Tangent to the Semi-circle, divide A G into &s;ix equal parts to find the &s;ix points of the Quadrant, and then again, each part into 12 to find the Minutes, (if the &s;ize of the In&s;trument &s;hall admit of this &s;econd divi&s;ion) now let one of the &s;ix parts be G H. Draw H M I parallel to G F, cutting the Semi|diameter in the points M and I, and then from the Center A, draw the right line A F D, and D &s;hall be the &s;ixth point of the &s;quare: draw A I L, and L &s;hall be the fifth point of the &s;quare: draw A M N, and N &s;hall be the &s;eventh point; and &s;o of all the re&s;t. Note, that the divi&s;ion will be the more exact, if after you have found the 1, 2, 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> points, you do by the Tran&s;portation or &s;etting of them off, de&s;ign the ninth, tenth, and eleventh.
<PB N="18" REF="83"> The half points, quarter points, and Minutes, are found in the &s;ame manner by &s;ubdi|viding each of the portions of the line A G into two, into four, or into twelve parts, which rai&s;ing perpendiculars from the points of the Divi&s;ions: Tho&s;e perpendiculars &s;hall cut the Semi-circle, and by the points of the Sections &s;hall the Diameters be drawn in the Quadrant, and the&s;e &s;hall cut the Quadrant in the parts de&s;ired, of Half points, Quarter points, or Minutes.</P>
<P>Now it is manife&s;t by our I.

<HEAD>The u&s;e of the aforementioned Divi&s;ion made in the ordinary Quadrant.</HEAD>
<P>LEt there be propounded any Piece of Artillery, or Mortar-Piece; and with it let there be one &s;ingle Experiment made, that is, let it be elevated to any point, as for example to the fifth. Let it off, and mea&s;ure the length of the Range, and let it be found, <HI>verbi gratia,</HI> to be 2000 parts; this done we may know how far the &s;ame Piece will carry, being charged in the &s;ame manner, and elevated to any what-ever ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er Point or Minute: which &s;hall be ea&s;ie by the Rule of three, the points in this In&s;trument, as well as the length of the Ranges, being proportional. The <HI>Praxis</HI> is this; I de&s;ire to know how far the &s;ixth point carrieth, I thus &s;ay, If five points give 2000 paces, how much &s;hall &s;ix points give? and I find 2400 paces. I &s;ay then that the &s;hot of that Piece at the &s;ixth point, that is at the greate&s;t Range, will curry 2400 of tho&s;e parts, at which of the fifth point it curried 2000.</P>
<P>And take notice by the way, that in&s;tead of performing this operation with the points 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, It may be done with their Complements, which are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.</P>
<P>But if it were required (which importeth much more) that we &s;hould elevate the afore&s;aid Piece in &s;uch &s;ort, that the length of the Range ought to be; for example, 1300 paces, we are to work thus. If 2000 paces, were made by 5 points, or to &s;ay better, by 60 Minutes of the Quadrant, by how many points &s;hall 1300 paces be made? the working will be 2000. 60. 1300. 39, and we &s;hall find that for to make the Range of 1300 paces, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to give the Piece the Mounture of 39 Mi|nutes of the Quadrant, or of three points and a quarter.</P>

<HEAD>The manner how to Compo&s;e our Square.</HEAD>
<P>BUt if we would frame an In&s;trument, which &s;hall not only mea&s;ure the length of the Ranges made at &s;everal Randons, but al&s;o the Altitude of the <HI>Parabola,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he duration or time of the flight [or Range] the &s;ublimity, and the other things demon|&s;trated in the afore&s;aid Book of Projects, all this &s;hall be performed with the &s;ole and &s;imple Semi-circle of I. Propo&s;ition. But let us proceed to the making of it.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>labeled rectangle inscribed by a labeled parabola</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Take the Rect-angled Plate A B C D, of Bra&s;s, or other &s;olid Matter, having the &s;ide A E long, for the applying of it to the Piece. Upon the Diameter A B, draw a Semi-circle A F B, which &s;hall be the Semi|circle
<PB N="19" REF="83"> of Propo&s;it. I. <HI>De Projectis;</HI> and in B place the Thred and Plummet, and divide the Semi-circle A F B into 90 equal parts, which &s;hall be the 90 degrees of the Quadrant; or into 144 equal parts, which &s;hall be the equal Points and Minutes of the ordinary Quadrant. Let us now demon&s;trate Geometrically, that this &s;quare is convenient to mea&s;ure, with exceeding plainne&s;s, the lengths and the Altitudes of the Ranges, the times of their Durations, the &s;ublimities of the <HI>Parabola</HI>'s, and the Elevations of the Pieces. And then we will &s;et down the Divi&s;ion of the Lines there|upon, without the need of any Table for the u&s;ing of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Let us, as in the &s;ub&s;equent Figure, place the &s;quare afore-named E A B C D in the mouth of any Piece, E A at plea&s;ure, and let the Plummet fall upon the point F of the Semi-circle A F B, divided into 90 equal <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines emerging from the mouth of a cannon</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> parts. It is certain, in the fir&s;t place, that the Arch B F mea&s;ureth the Elevation of the Piece E A above the Horizon. For we hav|ing by the Divi&s;ion of the Semi-circle into 90 parts only, valued every two degrees for one; we have made the Arch B F to be the mea&s;ure of the Angle B A F, that is, of the Elevation of the Piece above the Horizon; which Horizon &s;hall ever be the line A F. I &s;ay moreover, that if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the line A B, Diameter of the Semi-circle, to be the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the a&s;&s;igned Piece, or the half of the greate&s;t Range, the line F H, per|pendicular to the Diameter, &s;hall be the fourth part of the Amplitude or length of the Range; B H &s;hall be the &s;upream Altitude of the <HI>Parabola:</HI> A H &s;hall be the &s;ublimity; and B F &s;hall be the time of the Ranges Du|ration.</P>
<P>That this is &s;o, &s;hall thus be demon&s;trated (having reference to the I. propo&s;ition of Projects, and its Corollaries.) Let the line of the direction A B I be prolonged in|definitely, as al&s;o the perpendicular T B L; then by imagination take B L of &s;uch a length, that it may be really equal to half the greate&s;t Range of our pre&s;ent Piece. And about the Diameter B L, let there be imaginarily drawn the great Semi-circle B I L; cutting the Circumference B I in any point I; and draw the Horizontal line I M. It is manife&s;t, by the afore-cited Propo&s;. I. of Projects, that the line M I &s;hall be the real fourth part of the length of the Range; as al&s;o, that D M &s;hall be the (not imiginary, but real Altitude of the &s;aid Range; and &s;o the other mea&s;ures in the Semi|circle B I L, &s;hall be all true and real. Now ob&s;erve, that the Triangle H B F is like to the Triangle B I M, as being right-angled, and having two angles at the Point B. Therefore the &s;ame Propo&s;ition &s;hall be between all the &s;mall and imaginary mea&s;ures of the &s;quare A C, as is between all the true mea&s;ures in the imaginary and great Semi-circle B I L; that is, the lines, A B, B F, F H and H B, &s;hall be to one another in the &s;ame proportion re&s;pectively as L B, B I, I M, and M B. Therefore, as to arguing in the proportions, we may without any error, as well make u&s;e of tho&s;e feigned pro|portions upon the &s;quare, as of the true ones, imagined in the Amplitude of the Air.</P>
<P>It remains now that we &s;hew how this Doctrine, which hath hitherto been a meer Speculation, may now reduced to Manual practice, and that with facility. Every one &s;eeth that for our obtaining knowledge of the quantity of the lines A B, B F, F H, and H B, and their proportions in the precedent Figure, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that all the afore&s;aid lines were divided into mo&s;t Minute parts with &s;ome common mea&s;ure. To this purpo&s;e, therefore, we will divide the Diameter A B, and Semi-Diameter E D, into equal and very &s;mall parts, as appeareth in the following Figure; (upon which let us de&s;cribe the imaginary &s;quare) and then let us give to each divi&s;ion of
<PB N="20" REF="84"> the circumference, its guides parallel to tho&s;e Diameters, that &s;o in them the number and quantity of the lines which &s;hall be Indices of the length and Altitudes of the Ranges, may be read or found: And in the point of the angle of Semi-circle B, place the Thread and Plummet.</P>
<P>As to the number of parts into which the Diameter A B is to be divided, it &s;hall be left to the choice of every one; but yet it will be convenient to make choice of the number 2000, for that it will facilitate the Arithmetical operation.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, that if any one will make a &s;quare, as hath been &s;aid, on purpo&s;e for one kind of Artillery onely, he &s;hall without the lea&s;t trouble of Calculation, have the mea&s;ures of all its Ranges.</P>
<P>The Divi&s;ion of this &s;quare is to be made <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> in this manner. Make an Expe|riment of the greate&s;t Range of that &s;ame Piece to which you would have the &s;quare to be adapted, and let it be found <HI>v. gr.</HI> to be 3000. Then divide the Diameter of the &s;quare into 1500 parts, and the perpendicular Semi-diameter into 750 equal parts; that is, imagine that the Diameter A B 1500, is the half of the greate&s;t Range 3000; as al&s;o, that the perpendicular Semi-diameter E D 750, is the fourth part of that great|e&s;t Range. And thus, every of the other Elevations being afterwards given, as &s;oon as we &s;hall apply this Square to the Muzzle of the Piece, we &s;hall immediately &s;ee how many paces is the length, and how many the Altitude of the Range, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this &s;quare made <HI>v. gr.</HI> for a Canon of 60 pound Ball, would be al&s;o good for every other Canon of 60 pound Ball, that &s;hould be the &s;ame in length, and other proportions, with that.</P>
<P>It's true indeed, that if we would make the &s;quare univer&s;al, to &s;erve indifferently for all Species and Magnitudes of Artillery, we mu&s;t then do thus. Divide the Diameter A B in the precedent figure in 2000 equal parts: al&s;o let the Semi-Diameter E D be divided into 1000 equal parts, (we by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of the figure have divided it only into 100, taking the parts by ten and ten.) This done, let there be drawn by the Divi&s;ions of the Circumference, cut into equal degrees, as is u&s;ual, the guides parallel unto the Diameters, that &s;o one may upon tho&s;e Diameters read or find the quantity of the right lines, as they &s;hall happen to be.</P>
<P>Now let a Piece of Ordnance F G, unknown, be given. Then make the previous Experiment in this manner. Apply the &s;quare to the Muzzle of it, and let the thread fall in any place, as in I. Then find by the means <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines emerging from the mouth of a cannon</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> of its guide, the quantity of I O upon the divided Semi-Diameter, and keep it in mind, and then &s;hoot off the Gun, and mea|&s;ure the Range, which &s;uppo&s;e to be, for Example, 1250 paces: charge the Piece again in the &s;ame manner, and give it a different Mounture, &s;o that the thread may fall el&s;e|where, as in M: the length of this Range is &s;ought. Say thus: If the number of I O give the length 1250 paces, how many paces &s;hall the number of M L, that is found upon the divided Semi-diameter give? and you &s;hall in like manner find the length of that Range numbred in paces.</P>
<P>If you de&s;ire the Altitudes, and not the lengths of Ranges, then make the &s;ame work|ing as before, but not with the lines I O and M L, which give the lengths, but with H O and H L, which give the Altitudes. And if we would have the &s;ublimities, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to work with G O and G L. But, which more importeth, if any one after the previous Experiment hath been made, &s;hall de&s;ire that the &s;ame Piece may make an a&s;&s;igned Range, in length, <HI>v. gr.</HI> 2200 paces,
<PB N="21" REF="84"> we are to find what elevation ought to be given to the Piece. Work thus: If the 1250 paces of the previous Experiment give I O numbred, what &s;hall the 2200 paces give? and you &s;hall find a number, which &s;uppo&s;e for example, to be a&s;cribed on the &s;quare unto the line M L. the Peice Therefore is to be rai&s;ed to &s;uch a Randon, that the thread may pa&s;s thorow the point M; and then the Range &s;hall be 2200 paces.</P>
<P>The times or durations of the Ranges are given by the Lines H I and H M: and to find the Quantity of the&s;e it may be done two wayes. Fir&s;t, by way of calculation: For the &s;quare of the time H I (in the pre|cedent Figure) is alwayes equal to the two &s;quares of the Altitude H O, and of the fourth part of the length I O. Secondly, by making to all the Divi&s;ions of the Perifry B, C, D, (in the pre&s;ent Figure) from the Center A the circular guides B E, C F, D H: for A H being thus divided into very &s;mall equal parts, it &s;hall mea&s;ure all the right lines, A B, A C, and A D, which are the times of the Ranges.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>various labeled lines emerging from the mouth of a cannon</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Yet we confe&s;s as to Military u&s;e, the Amplitudes or lengths of Ranges, only &s;eem to Import; and they are of great moment: the re&s;t are all acce&s;&s;ary curio&s;ities, which &s;erve much more to the plea&s;ures of Geome|try, than to the occa&s;ions of War; therefore he that would have the &s;quare made only for this re&s;pect of Longitudes, may take the Semi|circle A B C of Bra&s;s (as in the pre&s;ent Figure) having its &s;ide A D, and with the Semicircle E B, divided into mo&s;t minute and equal parts, beginning the numeration from the point E; and may give moreover to all the points of the Perifry F, G, H, I, their guides G H, and F I parallel to A C: And thus he hath divided and numbred upon E B all the lines F N, and G O, which &s;erve for the Am|plitudes or Longitudes of the Ranges.</P>

<P>For Example, It is demanded where the Divi&s;ion of the one &s;eventh unequal point doth fall. Look upon the pre&s;ent Table, right again&s;t the number VII, and you find that it falleth upon <HI>gr.</HI> 61. and <HI>min.</HI> 47. of the ordinary Quadrant.</P>
<P>But &s;ince we are fallen upon the con&s;ideration of the Motion and <HI>Impetus</HI> of Projects, we cannot balk th' occa&s;ion of adding &s;omthing concerning the va|riety of their Forces in battering upon re&s;i&s;ting Superficies, &s;omtimes with greater, and &s;omtimes with le&s;&s;er Angles of Inclination. <HI>Galilaeo</HI> con&s;idereth th' <HI>Impetus</HI> of the&s;e Projects in every Point of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> <HI>Panahola,</HI> and mea&s;ureth how much it is in its &s;elf, that is, in re&s;pect of that Plane in which it doth perpendicularly hit.</P>

If it be perpendicular, the Percu&s;&s;ion operateth with &s;uch a cer|tain force: which we will prove to be the greate&s;t that that Range can have. If it &s;hall be at Oblique Angles, as the Line A B unto the Wall B C, I do note that in re|&s;pect to the Wall B C, there are in the <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>a right triangle and a wall</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> Line of the Project A B, two Motions com|pounded together: that is, one of approxi|mation perpendicular to the Wall, the other of pa&s;&s;age lateral, or parallel to the &s;ame. The perpendicular Motion is both repre|&s;ented and mea&s;ured by the Line A C; the parallel Motion by the Line C B: for both the Spaces A C and C B are pa&s;&s;ed by the Ball at the &s;elf &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve, that of the&s;e two &s;orts of <HI>Impetus,</HI> one onely is to the purpo&s;e, for encrea&s;ing the Forces to make a breach in the Wall, and to drive the Ball into it; to wit, the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the perpendicular La|tion A C. Th' other, although it were infinite, will never encrea&s;e the force of the Project again&s;t the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Wall,
<PB N="24" REF="86"> unle&s;s the perpendicular Lation be withall accelerated. Nay, if the Horizontal Motion were &s;imple and alone, without any mixture with the perpendicular Motion, what other would the Ball do but run equi-di&s;tant unto the Wall, without ever touching it, &s;o far would it be from breaking it; although it were a very thin Gla&s;s? When therefore, the Direction of any Projection being given, we &s;hall know how much of this perpendicular <HI>Impotus</HI> entereth into the Compo&s;ition of the Motion, we &s;hall al&s;o know the Activity or Moment of the Project towards the Re&s;i&s;tance of the oppo&s;ite Wall.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE Swiftne&s;s OF SOUND.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The &s;wiftne&s;s of Sound is greater than the &s;wiftne&s;s of Bullets &s;hot off, and fini&s;hes 230 fathon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the &s;pace of one &s;econd minute.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_WHo&s;oever would try the &s;wiftne&s;s of Sounds by night, and by day, either in valleys, woods, or mountains, either with or again&s;t the wind, or when it is rainy or fair weather, &s;hall find in all re&s;pects as I have tried it, that there will be alwayes the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s of Sound.</P>
<P>But after that you have &s;earched out a &s;econd by 230 fa|thoms, he that &s;hoots off a le&s;&s;er Gun, may again retire 230 fathoms, &s;o that he may be gone back from you 460 fathoms, the &s;ame or the like Sound in pa&s;&s;ing over that way will &s;pend two &s;econds; which when it &s;hall be five times multiplied by us, that we &s;hould hear the Sound 1150 fathoms, the fla&s;h by night breaking forth from the mouth of the Gun is alwayes &s;een at that di&s;tance be|fore the Sound is heard five &s;econds of time. And &s;eeing we make a <HI>French</HI> league to be 2500 fathoms, and the circuit of the Earth 7200, of &s;uch leagues, you may ea&s;ily conclude in what time the &s;ound does pa&s;s over one whole or &s;everal leagues, for the &s;wiftne&s;s of the &s;ound is not dimini&s;hed by its debility, whenas the la&s;t part of the Sound that may be heard does emulate the &s;wiftne&s;s of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Sound of the Gun therefore will pa&s;s over a league in the &s;pace of 11 &s;e|conds, &s;eeing a league contains 11 times 230 fathoms (the &s;pace pa&s;&s;ed over in a &s;e|cond minute) le&s;s onely by 30 fathoms, which are here &s;carce worth con&s;idera|tion, becau&s;e that they are pa&s;&s;ed over by the Sound in the &s;eventh part of a &s;econd.</P>
<PB N="64" REF="89">
<P>From which many things may be gathered; fir&s;t, that a Souldier attentive my de|cline or &s;hun the &s;hot of a Gun at one hundred fathoms, is he fore&s;aw the fla&s;h of it; which I thus demon&s;trate: It is evident from ob&s;ervation, that a Bullet in flying 100 fathoms does at the lea&s;t &s;pend a &s;econd of time, and the Sound of it in pa&s;&s;ing of them does at the mo&s;t &s;pend but half a &s;econd. Therefore the Souldier from the fire &s;een (if Vi&s;ion can be in an in&s;tant) hath a whole &s;econd wherein he my ea&s;ily go three or four paces before that the bullet can fly &s;o far; al&s;o there remains to him half a &s;econd from that point of time in which he hears the Sound, until the coming of the Bullet: although I would not advi&s;e any one to try that, unle&s;s he fir&s;t fortifie him&s;elf with a &s;hield, helmet, and all other kind of Armour, that he may be out of all danger. But any one may try it behind a wall, to which the Sound will come be|fore the Bullet.</P>
<P>Secondly, from the Sound and fire ob&s;erved, may be known how much the Guns are di&s;tant that are &s;hot off again&s;t the be&s;ieged, or be&s;iegers, even as to the in|genious Gunners there will not be wanting matter to promote their Art.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by hearing the Sound of Thunder, and &s;eeing the lightning go before may be known how far it is off, &s;o that if the Thunder be not changed from the place where the lightning was &s;een; for how many &s;econds (whether mea&s;ured by the pul&s;e, which exactly continues a &s;econd, or by a Pendulum or any other Watch) there are between the Lightning and the Sound, &s;o many 230 fathoms are to be reckoned; &s;o that if you number five &s;econds it may be di&s;tant from you half a league; if ten &s;econds a whole league, whether the di&s;tance &s;hall be upright, or &s;ide|wayes and oblique, for it matters nothing.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If by the turnings and windings or Circles in the air a &s;ound in the &s;ame manner may be con&s;idered, and cau&s;ed, as we &s;ee circles extende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the water &s;truck with the finger or a little &s;tone, as all almo&s;t believe, and if from the &s;wiftne&s;s of bo|dies in like manner moved we my ghe&s;s at their cra&s;&s;itude, thickne&s;s and weight, we may &s;ay that water is 1380 times thicker and heavier than air; for as much as the Semidiameter of Circles of the Water in any manner &s;truck, which is made in a &s;econd of time, &s;carce exceeds a foot, in which time the &s;emidi|amiter of Circles in the air, made al&s;o by any percu&s;&s;ion is 1380 foot, that is 230 fa|thoms; which proportion of gravities come very near to ob&s;ervations by him men|tioned. There is yet one thing that may cau&s;e &s;ome doubt, which is, that the Sound of greater Guns moves more &s;lowly than of le&s;&s;er, whereas our Geometer in the &s;iege at <HI>Theodonis</HI> ob&s;erved that their Sound was heard, from the fire &s;een, after thirteen or fourteen &s;econds of time, when yet he was &s;carce half a league di&s;tant from tho&s;e Guns; And the Sound according to that which hath been before &s;aid, may pa&s;s over a whole league and more in that time: Wherefore the Sound of tho&s;e Guns doth &s;eem to be different from that of le&s;&s;er Guns.</P>
<P>The Author having by this di&s;cour&s;e argued that the Sound of Guns is heard at the di&s;tance of above 16 miles a minute (which is almo&s;t as &s;wift as the <HI>Copernicans</HI> &s;uppo&s;e the Earth to move in its diurnal revolution about its Axis) it was thought fit to &s;ubjoyn hereto the Authors latter thoughts of the &s;ame Argument, publi&s;hed three years after.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE SWIFTNESS OF SOUND, And force of Bullets &s;hot out of Guns.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I have oftentimes con&s;idered that the Sound pa&s;&s;es over 230 fathoms in the time of a 2d or &s;ixtieth part of a minute; and that there &s;eem to ari&s;e &s;omeed doubt, whether there &s;hould be that Swiftne&s;s of the Sound of greater Guns, as there is of le&s;&s;er, with which I tried; at length it was ob|&s;erved that in the &s;pace of eleven &s;econds, the Sound of the greater Guns of the Kings Armory, have pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;ame Armory, after the fla&s;h was &s;een, as far as our hou&s;e, or the <HI>Vicennian</HI> Con|vent, whil&s;t for obtaining the &s;urrender of <HI>Pouploon</HI> the Guns were &s;hot off by night.</P>
<P>But when with a fathom I found that it was 3524 fathoms from Port Saint <HI>Anthony</HI> to the gate of the afore&s;aid Convent, where the ear was, and to the wall of the <HI>Vicennian</HI> Ca&s;tle fir&s;t meeting it, near 2500 fathoms, 'tis certain fir&s;t that it is a ju&s;t league of 2500 fathoms from the Garden walk of the Armoty, from whence the Guns are wont to be &s;hot off, to that Ca&s;tle: for if any thing in the pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be dimi|ni&s;hed that di&s;tance will well enough equal it, whereby the corner of the Garden is more di&s;tant, or the walk by <HI>Sequana</HI> nearer from the Ca&s;tle, than Port Saint <HI>An|thony.</HI></P>
<P>It is evident therefore that the Sound runs over more than 230 Fathoms in each &s;econd, to wit, 320 in every &s;econd, which make 1920 foot; which &s;ince any one can prove by his own experiments, I need not &s;ay more thereof.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may imagine that hence perhaps mu&s;t be concluded that greater Sounds pa&s;s more &s;wiftly, which di&s;agrees with divers ob&s;ervations. But when &s;ometimes the&s;e experiments &s;hall be repeated, that I may number the &s;econds, I &s;hall adverti&s;e, for as much as I conjecture that there is no &s;wiftne&s;s of &s;ound greater than that, which I have proved of 230 fathoms for a &s;econd; for in the&s;e &s;mall matters I do not ap|prove that common &s;aying, He that acts by another, &s;eems to act by him&s;elf; who want not opportunities may ob&s;erve for their own &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But now we &s;hall add &s;ome thing concerning the &s;wiftne&s;s of Bullets &s;hot out of Guns. When therefore at the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Dorai&s;ons</HI> four leagues from the <HI>Sexti|an</HI> waters, I commanded a Bra&s;&s;e Gun nine foot long, who&s;e name was the <HI>Marchione&s;s,</HI> commonly called <HI>la Marqui&s;e,</HI> (who&s;e Bullet was two pounds and an ounce, but quantity of Powder, &s;uch as is wont to be in the u&s;e of le&s;&s;er Guns, the weight of one pound) to be levelled horizontally, with a plum line I found that the Bullet &s;hot off Horizonitally, in the time of five &s;econds had pa&s;&s;ed over 630 fathoms or 3780 foot, and had reached the horizon, or fell to the ground, as was evident by the huge quantity of du&s;t rai&s;ed by the blow.</P>
<P>Moreover that point of Earth which was fir&s;t &s;truck by the Bullet was depre&s;&s;ed under the horizon of the Gun 27 fathoms, for otherwi&s;e the Range &s;hould not have been &s;o great before its fall to the earth, which meets &s;o much the more &s;low|ly by how much it is the more depre&s;&s;ed under the Horizon of the Gun &s;hot off, and I pre&s;ume I have attributed a le&s;&s;er &s;wiftne&s;s to the Guns than is ju&s;t, unle&s;s yet
<PB N="66" REF="90"> the Bullets of the greater Guns &s;hot off with very fine powder, which we u&s;ed, may exceed the &s;wiftne&s;s of Bullets &s;hot from Harquebuzes; of which thing I do not yet pa&s;s judgement, till experiment, &s;hall bring &s;ome further evidence: but I &s;hall pro|pound &s;ome things newly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Now therefore of the Bullet which I made trial of, I affirm that the &s;wiftne&s;s was &s;o great that, at lea&s;t, in each &s;econd minute it could pa&s;s over 126 fa|thoms.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, at lea&s;t, becau&s;e the ob&s;ervers know that the force on the Bullet doth go before the excu&s;&s;ion or fla&s;h of the powder, and the perceiving thereof; &s;o that half a &s;econd may well be attributed to this time. Moreover in the fir&s;t &s;econd the Bullet pa&s;&s;es more &s;wiftly, in which time I doubt not but it pa&s;&s;es over 150 fathoms; La&s;tly, if by rea&s;on of that tarrying which. happens betwen the &s;miting of the Earth until the du&s;t is &s;een to ri&s;e, we &s;hould augment that &s;wiftne&s;s by &s;o many fa|thoms as it could pa&s;s over in half a minute, to wit 70, and that the &s;wiftne&s;s be &s;up|po&s;ed almo&s;t equal for the time of five &s;econds, and in each &s;econd of that time that it pa&s;&s;es over 140 fathoms, that is, if the point of the Earth fir&s;t &s;truck were 700 fa|thoms di&s;tant from the Gun, it would reach it in the time of five &s;econds. Then the &s;wiftne&s;s of the Bullet may be determined from what hath been &s;aid, to be 130 fa|thoms, at lea&s;t, in the time of a &s;econd: which al&s;o agrees with the experiments of Bullets &s;hot from le&s;&s;er Guns: to wit, they pa&s;s an hundred fathoms in the &s;ame time as the Sound of the Gun hath the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>For if, behind a wall that is to be &s;truck by the Bullet, the ear be attentive, in the &s;ame in&s;tant the &s;ound and the percu&s;&s;ion of the Bullet is heard, as if the very Bullet had cau&s;ed that Sound; which doubtle&s;s you &s;hall find to be true as I did if you try: although it will be worth the labour to prove it, not only with that mo&s;t refined powder, which they are wont to u&s;e who &s;hoot at a mark for a wager, but al&s;o with the cour&s;er &s;ort of Powder for great Guns, that it may be ob&s;erved whether it cau&s;es any &s;en&s;ible difference of the &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>What&s;oever powder you u&s;e, the lea&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s of the Bullet, may be defined in the fir&s;t &s;econd an hundred, the greate&s;t 150 fathoms, if you but &s;o much Pow|der into the Gun as is nece&s;&s;ary for a good &s;hot; for if you put in but a few grains which can &s;carce &s;hoot the Bullet off, another thing. is to be &s;aid.</P>
<P>I add that a Bullet &s;hot vertically or Perpendicularly upright from the afore&s;aid Gun in its a&s;cent and de&s;cent, &s;pends 36 &s;econds: which if it &s;pend &s;o much time in its Ri&s;e as in its fall, and that a heavy body de&s;cending in the time of 18 &s;econds alwayes keeps the &s;ame proportion in ha&s;tening its de&s;cent which it keeps in the four fir&s;t &s;econds, the Vertical a&s;cent &s;hall be 648 fathoms, fora&s;much as a Bullet of &s;ix pound Weight of that Gun, which the Illu&s;trious Knight <HI>Hugenius</HI> cau&s;ed to be &s;hot off at the <HI>Hague</HI> upon my reque&s;t, in its a&s;cent in the time of 16 &s;econds pa&s;&s;ed over 512 fathoms, which falling, pierced three foot into the Earth.</P>
<P>But two things there are which may le&s;&s;en the &s;pace of the a&s;cent; fir&s;t, that per|haps the bullet may not &s;pend &s;o much time in its a&s;cent as in its de&s;cent, becau&s;e Ar|rows in a&s;cending pa&s;s over the &s;ame way in three &s;econds of time that in de&s;cend|ing they do in five &s;econds: furthermore &s;hould we imagine to &s;hoot with the mouth of the Gun towards the Earth, the Bullet would pierce deeper into the Earth, than by its mere fall, as it happens in Arrows: whence there ari&s;es in me no &s;mall &s;u&s;picion that the eyes in the a&s;cent of the Bullet are deceived, to wit that the Bullet was even falling when it was yet e&s;teemed to a&s;cend: which al&s;o may be imagined of Arrows, which perhaps had began to de&s;cend when they &s;hould &s;eem to be inverted, that the point which went before a&s;cending &s;hould likewi&s;e de&s;cending antecede: which you may conclude of from the &s;mall blow of the Bullet de&s;cending, unle&s;s you may contend that the &s;troke made by the Bullet &s;hot upright from the mouth of the Gun and falling upon the Earth very near, is greater indeed than the &s;troke of the &s;ame Bullet &s;hot from the greate&s;t height, and that not by rea&s;on of the greater &s;wiftne&s;s, but by rea&s;on of the air &s;o unawares intercepted and oppre&s;&s;ed, that it may much

<P>Which indeed can be known by Rocks and Mountains 600 fathoms high, to wit, one &s;tanding on the top &s;hall ob&s;erve what time the Bullet that is &s;hot off at the foot of the Mountain, &s;hall &s;pend in coming to the top or any other place of the Mountain, and a fign being given &s;hall warn the leveller of the Gun of the time, or from it &s;hall learn the time of the a&s;cent and de&s;cent: from which cutting off the time of the a&s;cent &s;hall conclude how much &s;horter it &s;hall be in the time of the de&s;cent; which al&s;o may be ob&s;erved by an iron Bullet red-hot &s;hot off in the night, whil&s;t it can be &s;een light to the greate&s;t height: how|ever it is I think fit to add the ob&s;ervation of that Holland Gun, which being levelly or horizontally &s;hot off, carried a Bullet of &s;ix pounds 398 paces, before it fir&s;t touched the Earth, taking a pace for three foot; after this Space it made eight leaps, and at length it cea&s;ed at 1750 paces: we have here expre&s;&s;ed the di&s;tance between each leap, as likewi&s;e the di&s;tance of each grazing from the Gun.</P>

<P>Moreover a middle range of 45 degrees was 3225 paces, who&s;e half if we take it for an upright or vertical &s;hot, will be 3225 foot, or 537 &frac12; fathoms, for which before we counted only 512. Hence it comes to pa&s;s that we may judge that a vertical &s;hot in the a&s;cent doth not proceed by the &s;ame or equal and proportionable degrees of &s;wift|ne&s;s, by which it falls in its de&s;cent, for at lea&s;t there are wanting 25 fathoms, by which 512 differ from 537, although that way of him that levelled the Gun, in counting by common paces, re&s;trained to no rule, cannot be &s;o certain, but that the other may differ from it, &s;o that it cannot with undoubted certainty be reduced to our defined fa|thoms.</P>
<P>Whoever therefore would certainly try, let him have a chain or wheel for counting of fathoms or any other determinate mea&s;ures, as is done in the pa&s;&s;age of the league of 2500 fathoms from the <HI>Ba&s;tilian</HI> Tower erected right over again&s;t Port Saint <HI>Anthony</HI> as for as the walls of the <HI>Vicennian</HI> Ca&s;tle that fir&s;t meet.</P>
<P>There remaines one thing that may dimini&s;h the upright height, to wit, that the Bullet &s;pends more &s;econds in the de&s;cent than it ought, after it comes to the point of equality, after which it doth not any more augment its own &s;wiftne&s;s: &s;o that not only 16 &s;econds are to be reckoned for the de&s;cent of the Holland Bullet, but per|haps 20, and 12 are to be counted for the a&s;cent.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="91">
<P>For although in moderate heights of 40 or 50 fathoms, the acce&s;s to the point of equality, in leaden Bullets may not be &s;ufficiently ob&s;erved, it does not thence follow that it comes not to &s;uch a point, in greater heights of an hundred or more fathoms; yea experience proveth the Contrary.</P>
<P>Let there be taken a Corken. Bullet which is at lea&s;t 70 times lighter than a leaden one, yet both them almo&s;t in the &s;ame time make a three foot &s;pace, although per|haps the Corke attains its point of equality within 50 foot.</P>
<P>But whether a leaden Bullet 70 times heavier, can pa&s;s over a &s;eventy fold &s;pace, that is, 3500 foot, before it comes to its point of equality, which little differs from the height to which Bullets arrive that are vertically &s;hot out of Guns, although I can|not yet conclude, yet it &s;eemes probable enough to me. Moreover the force will never be augmented after the arival at that point, if the greater force &s;hall be ar|gued from only the greater &s;wiftne&s;s. But note, it hath been ob&s;erved by a Noble man who related it to me, that a field Gun 18 foot long, and cut &s;horter foot by foot, did alwaies curry its &s;hott the further till it came to be eleven foot long, and then it be|gan not to give &s;o great a Range.</P>
<P>To which may be added from the experience of &s;ome in &s;mall Guns, that if it be over charged with Powder, part of the Powder will blow out of the Gun without firing. Morever if the Bullet be not quite remmed home it will pierce the further, and the Gun recoyle the more.</P>
<P>Al&s;o that where the Gun is found mo&s;t to furr with many &s;hootings off with Powder, there it ought to be cut off, the remainder being the proper length requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>It hath been related that a &s;hip becalmed and tormented with the Cu&s;hee Piece of a Galley, that lay in a manner out of &s;hot, was at the la&s;t reached by the indu&s;try of a Mariner, who wrapping up a much le&s;&s;er &s;ized Bullet than the Bore of the Gun made u&s;e of required, in a good Wad did &s;hoot as far as the Galley, thereby retaliating the Injury received.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Depre&s;&s;ion of &s;hot below the Marke.</HEAD>
<P>I Have often took care that a Gun &s;hould be &s;hot off commonly called an Har|quebuz, at the &s;pace of an hundred fathoms from the mark, that is, &s;ix hun|dred foot, which make three hundred common paces, and found that the Bullet was depre&s;&s;ed under the mark-line eight or ten foot, which would &s;carce have made a greater &s;pace, if it had fallen perpendicularly down at the &s;ame moment of time it was left off.</P>
<P>Again at the the Marque&s;s of <HI>Dorai&s;ons,</HI> a Bullet &s;hot off, in the &s;pace of five &s;econds of time fell 27 fathoms beneath its horizontal line or marke; and whereas perchance the ri&s;ing of the du&s;t, and the perceiving of it might make us lo&s;e a &s;econd of time, and that we retain only four &s;econds, then in each &s;econd the Bullet &s;hould be carried 157 &frac12; fathoms (&s;urely not more) yet it ought to have de&s;cended 32 fathoms, if it de&s;cends &s;o much horizontally &s;hot off as it would naturally fall were it not &s;hot off, and therefore it either lo&s;es &s;ome thing of its de&s;cent by rea&s;on of its being &s;hot off, or in running 360 fathoms, it &s;pends not &s;o much as four whole &s;econds of time, but rather about 3 &frac34;.</P>
<P>We add that &s;omething is by this means abated from the &s;wiftne&s;s of the fall for the &s;pace of 27 fathoms which the Bullet in &s;hooting off did de&s;cend, or fall below the marke: &s;o that all things con&s;idered, I would not as yet &s;tart from that opinion, which holds that two heavy bodies, to wit, two Bullets, whereof one may fall perpendi|cularly from its place above the Horizon, and the other be forc|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of this there is a contro|ver&s;ie between</HI> Borel|lius <HI>who publi&s;hed a Treati&s;e</HI> de vi percu&s;|&s;ionis, <HI>the which was writ again&s;t by</HI> Ho|norato Fabri <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> his Dialogues of Motion.</HI></NOTE> horizontaly, &s;hall both in the &s;ame moment of time arrive at the ground or Horizon: for example, if the pit of the afore&s;aid <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> be 27 fathoms deep, as indeed it is, if I rightly remem|ber, or al&s;o a little deeper, 32. a Bullet &s;hot into the fields inclo&s;ed between the Sextian waters, will hit the horizon, the &s;ame mo|ment,
<PB N="69" REF="91"> that the like Bullet falling, &s;hall the &s;uperiour &s;uperfice of the afore&s;aid point of the water.</P>
<P>There is another thing that I may &s;u&s;pect, whether or no the &s;urveyour hath ac|curately enough mea&s;ured the horizontal depre&s;&s;ion; however it be, you &s;ee with what difficulties experiments are hedged in, and how much natural knowledge is in|debted to them, who are enriching the &s;ame with exact Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>But note that the air that meets the bullet that is &s;hot off does &s;o much hinder or dimini&s;h its motion, as much as a wind of the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s with the Ball, blowing con|tinually again&s;t the &s;ame in a vacuum.</P>
<P>For is it not the &s;ame impediment, or de&s;truction of the &s;ame force, if the bullet beats the aire or is beaten of it? But when I &s;aid it was known by experience, that water does &s;o much the more de&s;cend, by how much the &s;lower it moves horizontally, and the &s;ame may &s;eem to be concluded of other projected heavie bodies; I adverti&s;e that ob&s;ervations are not yet made &s;o exact as that any thing of this nature &s;hould be too po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Impediment of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>IN regard that Bullets &s;hot from Guns do about the end of their motion utter a more vehement noi&s;e or hi&s;&s;ing than about the middle or onwards; there is no doubt to be made but that they move more &s;lowly, and the force decrea&s;ing as the &s;wiftne&s;s, <HI>Mer&s;ennus</HI> concludes that the Curved range line de&s;cribed by a Bullets mo|tion cannot exactly de&s;cribe a Parabola, but however the Theory is tolerable, admit|ing the fir&s;t violence to move in the touch line of a Parobola, and it is likely the grea|ter Mountures cau&s;e the greate&s;t difference, becau&s;e, there is &s;o much the more Air beaten and removed by the pa&s;&s;age of the &s;hot.</P>
<P>But yet it is mo&s;t hard to find out, how much the Air hinders; for although it &s;eems to hinder &s;o much, as the wind agitating the air with the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;trikes upon the Bullet &s;hot off; yet we are Ignorant of the force of that wind compared with the force of the Bullet &s;hot off; unle&s;s we may appeale to our other experiments in which is &s;hewn that the air is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> lea&s;t a thou&s;and times lighter than water: and &s;ccing that a leaden Bullet is eleven times heavier than water of the &s;ame bulke, a leaden Bullet will exceed the weight of the air 11000 times: and therefore the air agitated by the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s of the Bullet, meeting with the bul|let, &s;eems to take away the 1100 part of the &s;wiftne&s;s from the Bullet &s;hot off.</P>
<P>Which impediment truly is &s;o light, that in the de&s;cription of the Parabole it &s;carce ought to be con&s;idered.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>WHenas I made trial about the &s;hooting of Bullets in Guns only of an indif|ferent bigne&s;s (which we commonly call Harquebuzes) which in the a&s;cent and de&s;cent together &s;pend 22, 23 or 24 Seconds of time, <HI>Peter Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">il</HI> a man mo&s;t skilful and accurate in ob&s;ervations while&s;t he lived at <HI>Francopolis,</HI> found (at my reque&s;t) the Range of a &s;hot, out of a great gun, at the elevation of 22 degrees, who&s;e iron Bullet weighed 33 pounds and &frac13;, to be 1900 fathoms, which the Bullet flew or pa&s;&s;ed over in the &s;pace of 20, 21 or 22 &s;econds; the Gun being placed at 8 fathoms in the Ca&s;tle above ground or Horizon; from which place a Bullet of 12 pounds which &s;o many pounds of gun-pouder &s;hot off at the elevation of 16 de|grees above the horizon, &s;pent in the air 16 &s;econds.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, a Culverine of 12 foot long and horizontally levelled being 6 fathom high above the Horizon of the ocean and &s;hot off, the Bullet, who&s;e diameter was almo&s;t five Inches, continued 8 &s;econds of time in the air; when yet another Bullet who&s;e diame|ter was 6 Inches and 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, al&s;o horizontally &s;hot off out of an other Gun 12 foot and &frac12; long, &s;pent only 6 &s;econds in the air; another Gun &s;hot off at the Elevation of 15 de|grees, its Bullet &s;pent 24 &s;econds in the Air.</P>
<P>An Iron Culverine of 10 foot long, who&s;e Bullet, had a diameter of almo&s;t four inches, horizontally l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">velled, and &s;tanding 9 fathoms above the &s;urface or brim of the Sea, &s;pent only three &s;econds, in Its horizontal Range, after which grazing five times above the Ocean, &s;pent four other &s;econds.</P>
<P>Three daies al&s;o before the taking of <HI>Theoud, Robervallus</HI> our Geometer ob&s;erved, the Bullets of Guns &s;hot off from the City again&s;t our Souldiers, for the mo&s;t part to &s;pend only 14 &s;econds of time in the air, after which there was a hi&s;&s;ing increa&s;ed more and more until the force and motion of the Bullet was almo&s;t quite extin|gui&s;hed, and that after the &s;hot had flew almo&s;t half a league.</P>
<P>Which being &s;uppo&s;ed it may be Theorically concluded, how great the &s;hoots ought to be at what&s;oever elevation above the horizon, if they be in &s;uch Proportion one to another, as &s;hots in a Vacuity, no Medium hindring; that is, for example, if the range of 45 degrees be double the height of the Perpendicular or vertical &s;hot in a &s;pace not hindring, &s;o is the range of 45 in the air to the vertical in the air, and &s;o of the re&s;t; which ob&s;ervations only will teach; which yet are mo&s;t difficult in the greater &s;ort of Guns or Bows, e&s;pecially the perpendicular, who&s;e height we can &s;carce certainly know, unle&s;s &s;ome rock might be found high enough, to who&s;e top, or &s;ome certain place, the Bullet or Arrow may come, the height of which top or place we may after|wards mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>No Towers &s;urely are high enough; and by the time of the de&s;cent or fall of the Bullet, to conclude a place may be found to which bullets, darts, or other things that are ca&s;t upright or vertically a&s;cending, do come, doth therefore fail, becau&s;e they do not ob&s;erve the &s;ame rule of &s;wiftne&s;s in de&s;cending; as is evident from darts, to which &s;eeing it happens in their a&s;cent or ri&s;e of 50 fathoms to be &s;lackned in their de&s;cent or fall, &s;omething like this may be al&s;o thought to happen to Bullets, to wit, when they de|&s;cend from the height of a thou&s;and fathoms.</P>
<P>But you may avoid the&s;e difficulties: for if from that rock in the <HI>Dolphinate,</HI> who&s;e

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ob&s;ervations I &s;hall add tho&s;e which the indu&s;trious <HI>Galeus</HI> an Engineer to divers D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kes in who&s;e pre&s;ence he made them, writ with his own hand and gave me, which that you may more ea&s;ily under&s;tand, let the greater Gun K, which we commonly call a Cannon, be parallel to the Horizon, and let the eye be taking aim by the points I and O, the horizontal &s;hot being &s;uppo&s;ed O P, or in the figure beneath, S X, or, T V, he &s;ayes that the remainder of the rang which bends till it touches the horizon in the point &Lgr;, is almo&s;t equal to the horizontal &s;hot, that is, that there is almo&s;t as much &s;pace made by the bullet from that point, from which it begins to bend towards the horizon, un til it touch it, as it had made before the bend|ing of it.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>But now let us &s;uppo&s;e that horizontal &s;hot O P, or T V, removed to the lower figure in which let A B be the horizontal plain, and let the the afor&s;aid horizontal &s;hot be A I, <HI>Galeus</HI> contends that the middle range of 45 degrees, which is the longe&s;t of all, is eleven fold the length of the horizontal &s;hot O P, or A I: And in tho&s;e Guns which are half the weight of the foregoing greater Guns, to be in re&s;pect of A I, as 10 and &frac12; is to 1, and in le&s;&s;er Guns as 10 to 1 that is our figure, as A B in re|&s;pect of A I; in which the middle range is A G E B; for that is the middle range
<PB N="72" REF="93"> which pa&s;&s;es through the middle of the quadrant &PHgr; 5, which they call the &s;ixth point, becau&s;e it is the middle part of the half circumference A, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, divided into 12 equal parts; which joynd to the quadrant &PHgr; 5, may be u&s;eful for levelling the gun at any elevation above the horizon, if it &s;hall be divided not only into 12 parts, but al&s;o into an 180 degrees.</P>
<P>And hence he concludes that the dead or exact Horizontal Shot or range, that is in the figure, R &Lgr; I to be in Proportion to the middle range as 1 to 6; or in le&s;&s;er Guns, as one to five; which dead Horizontal ranges is to the range of an Elevationof one de|gree, as five to &s;ix, or more exactly as 55 to 67, or as 14 to 17.</P>
<P>But when the recoyling of the greater Gun is hindred, the dead Horizontal range will be greater by a &s;eventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth part, than that range which is made with recoyling; in le&s;&s;er Guns it will be a twelfth or a fifteenth part le&s;s.</P>
<P>Moreover he a&s;&s;erts that the middle range A 6 E does proceed righton without arching by the line A G, which may be almo&s;t equal to A 5, that is, almo&s;t 5 fold or 4 &frac12; the Hori|zontal &s;hot: then not only that it does a&s;cend to the point D, &s;o that the greate&s;t height of the middle range may be fourfold the Horizontal, and be over the line A C &s;ix|fold the &s;ame which &s;ome affirm; but he by ob&s;ervation &s;aies is fal&s;e again&s;t <HI>Tartaglia;</HI> affirming that the greate&s;t altitude mu&s;t be F E, an&s;wering the point 7, that is &s;even di&s;tances of Horizontal range from the gun A, that F E may be almo&s;t five fold the Ho|rizontal-range.</P>
<P><HI>Galeus</HI> did likewi&s;e well conjecture that the Curve for the middle range does come near to the Curve of an hyperbolical or parabolical line, and that not by force of rea&s;on, but only from ob&s;ervations.

<HEAD>The Ranges of Spouts or Squirts compared with the Ranges of Bullets &s;hot out of Guns.</HEAD>
<P>FOr as much as a Bullet &s;pends a greater time in its fall than its ri&s;e, like darts; or the de&s;cent is not &s;o &s;wift, that it &s;hould always ha&s;ten in that degree where|by in three or four &s;econds, we have found its &s;wiftne&s;s to be increa&s;ed, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be confirmed from this rea&s;on, becau&s;e a bullet de&s;cending cannot have &s;o great a power to &s;mite, as it hath a&s;cending, &s;o that approaching the Earth it is not &s;o &s;wiftly moved, as when it comes from the mouth of the Gun, for when the &s;wiftne&s;s of any thing projected is equall, it equally &s;trikes.</P>
<P>Therefore I account Spouts u&s;eful, &s;eeing they bring us to the knowledg of &s;hooting, of which otherwi&s;e we could not judge, by rea&s;on of the difficulty of trial which is mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;cerned in tubes: for becau&s;e any one may compare in a little time what ever &s;hot he plea&s;es with another, to wit, a middle Range <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Former Figure.</HI></NOTE> with a vertical, or Perpendicular one as to time and height, that this may be the better under&s;tood, in the following figure let the Cock be A above the Horizon A B, and let the altitude of the tube be A 12, who&s;e vertical Squirt is A &PHgr;, Experience teacheth us that the length of the middle Squirt A B, is double to the Ver|tical A &PHgr;.</P>
<P>But to what height the middle Squirt ranges, whether to D or E, which al&s;o you may under&s;tand of Bullets &s;hot from Guns, there is none hitherto hath ob&s;erved: but it is one half of the vertical &PHgr; A, wherefore the point D or E is higher than it ought to be, and whatever is &s;aid by the ingenious, may be corrected by &s;pouts.</P>
<P>There are other things al&s;o that want inquiry into; for example, how it can come to pa&s;s, that a bullet &s;hot out of the mouth of a Gun from O to P comes right on, when in that time it flying along the line O P a hundred fathoms ought to fall to|wards the center of the Earth 12 foot, if the horizontal motion of a thing violently projected hinders not its natural motion, as many imagine in a vacuity or place that does not impede.</P>
<P>For although that can partly be explained by the diver&s;ity of the lines, which is &s;ound in Guns, to wit the line R X Y, which follows the out&s;ide of the Gun, and that which they call <HI>Linea animae</HI> S Z, which pa&s;&s;es thorough the axis of the hollow M N to the afore&s;aid &s;ide, is in no wi&s;e parallel: becau&s;e, to wit, the bullet K or H levelling at L may a&s;cend to the &s;ide line I L, or the point S pa&s;&s;ing to Z may a&s;cend to the point X of the &s;ide line R Y: yet another thing is to be added, when what is afore|&s;aid is not true, when the eye of the &s;hooter takes not aim by the line I L or R X but by the line M N or S X: for then the bullet K does not de&s;cend &s;o much, as it would if it were left to it &s;elf in the air.</P>
<P>Add, that the water out of the Cock fitted to the Horizontal Squirt doth not de|&s;cend &s;o much, as it would if left to it &s;elf; for it is manife&s;t by Experience, that the Horizontal Squirt of 30 foot, which continues two &s;econds, de&s;cends not &s;o much as eight foot, when according to the law of bodies of equal weight, it &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, or at lea&s;t by rea&s;on of the re&s;i&s;tance of the air breaking the water it ought to de&s;cord 30 foot.</P>
