<HEAD>A Narrative from Major Dorril, of the proceedings at &s;ea, from the <HI>13</HI> of May to this pre&s;ent.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 31 of May, comming out of the Sound, off the Naes, we di&s;covered about 10 in the morning a fleet of &s;ome 60 or 70 great &s;hips, with 5 great convoyers, they were two Engli&s;h miles to the weather of us, and &s;tood South-ea&s;t for the Sound; we &s;tood along the Land North|we&s;t. <HI>May</HI> 15. The wind blew very hard, we &s;tood in to the &s;ea 6 or 8 Gla&s;&s;es, &s;tanding again to the &s;hore &s;outh, we di&s;covered a great &s;ail to our windward, about 4 in the afternoon, we aimed to be between him and the &s;hore, but looking out we di&s;covered above 100 of great &s;hips, with many convoyers, who having a Galiot with him &s;ent him off from the fleet to di&s;cover us, we had a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Fane up, which when he di&s;covered he came no further. This is conceived to be the Ru&s;&s;ia fleet. <HI>May</HI> 16. We e&s;pyed the Berghen fleet, and immediatly thereupon a great &s;hip in our water athwart our bow, and there was in his compa|ny above 300 great &s;hips, which we afterwards di&s;cover|ed, all &s;tanding &s;outh, we could not mi&s;s them, therefore dur&s;t not tru&s;t to our running, but rather by plain dealing or impudence, either to outface them, or to deceive them, and &s;o we &s;tood through their whole fleet, keeping all our men clo&s;e but five, whereof 4 were Danes; the fir&s;t &s;hip that came up to &s;peak us, was a &s;hip with 20 Guns, he hung out his Dutch colours, we our Dani&s;h, he a&s;kt us whence we were, we told him from <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> and bound for Berghen in Norway; we a&s;kt them from whence

<P>Out of Scotland it is certified, that the <HI>Advice, Fox,</HI> and <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> frigats, met with two of the Dutch Merchant|men not far from <HI>Shetland,</HI> laden with <HI>French</HI> wines; who for &s;ome time di&s;puted the &s;eas, but after a very &s;harp conflict, they were both boarded, and brought into Aber|deen.</P>
<P>From aboard the Re&s;olution off the Texel, 27 May, came thus: A councell being called by the Generals on board this &s;hip, it was this day re&s;olved by the Officers, That the whole Engli&s;h fleet do from hence &s;et &s;ail for the Engli&s;h coa&s;ts; that the place of Randezvouz be where they &s;hall come to anchor off of Yarmouth, on the back&s;ide of the Sands; and it was re&s;olved al&s;o that Or|ders &s;hould be &s;ent into the River, and other parts, which accordingly are &s;ent for the re&s;t of the &s;hips that are ready to &s;ayl, to come and joyn with the fleet there, where it is re&s;olved to &s;tay 48 hours. We are now within &s;ight of the &s;teeple, and do ride at Anchor five langues from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Van Trump we hear is at Gorce with 120 men of War, and fifty more are expected to joyn with him, which will not probably bee prevented. Gen. Blake is joyned with Monk and Dean, and now are bound Southward; and ha|ving &s;ent forth a Van &s;quadron, &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of 10 Dani&s;h and Dutch &s;hips, laden with Pitch, Tar, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the enemy hath taken from Us two brave colliers, and look with a notable &s;heeps eye upon our Malego men, coming for <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>OUr fleet under the command of the two Generals, put forth from Yarmouth Road the 31 of May, to &s;eek for the Hollanders; and upon the &s;econd in&s;tant, a|bout four in the morning, they di&s;covered a great fleet of &s;hips near St. Georges Channel; upon this di&s;covery the Generals &s;uppo&s;ing them to be the Dutch fleet, immedi|ately called a Councel of War, where it was re&s;olved that they &s;hould advance towards them, and give them battel: They likewi&s;e having a view of our Fleet, as far as they could perceive, made preparation to oppo&s;e us, which was a great rejoicing to our fleet, who&s;e onely aim was to in|gage them, &s;o referring them&s;elves to the protection of the Almighty, they bore up to them: About 7 in the mor|ning they began to ingage, and the fight was fierce and ter|rible for us to hear; whereupon the Governour &s;ent forth a pinnace to ob&s;erve the i&s;&s;ue of the fight, which about 9 in the evening returned, and gave us an account, that with great hazard, and not without &s;ome &s;mall lo&s;&s;e, our &s;hips had took 4 of the enemies, &s;unk 5, and burnt 3, upon re|ceipt of this we in this Town not onely gave thanks to the Lord for this, but required a future ble&s;&s;ing upon the indeavours of his poor &s;ervants. Having ended our Ori|&s;ons we began to make preparation both for offending the enemy, and defending our &s;elves, and mu&s;tred all the force we could make, planting our great guns in convenient places, and providing ammunition for our &s;elves, and for the &s;hips if occa&s;ion &s;hould &s;erve. The Ordnance plaied til after day light, and this morning very early they began a|gain. I can give you no further account for the pre&s;ent, but till the next opportunity, mu&s;t de&s;ire to remain,</P>
