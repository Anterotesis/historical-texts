<HEAD>THE Pre&s;ent State OF CAROLINA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_CAROLINA is part of the Main in <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI> and &s;o much celebrated by Moun&s;ier <HI>Laudonere,</HI> that he entitles it <HI>Florida,</HI> be|cau&s;e of her florid, and fragrant fields, im|belli&s;h't with flowers, that perfume the air: who&s;e &s;weet &s;cituations, by rea&s;on of mo&s;t delicious and plea&s;ant meadows (and flouri&s;hing &s;avana's) adorns the Continent; and who&s;e benevolent bre&s;t &s;ends daily &s;upplies to the planter, and hourly relief to the poor and nece&s;&s;itous native: who&s;e &s;pacious arms (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s if circulating the Ocean) proclaims her &s;hores &s;anctuary to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Marriners; and a generous protection to deplora|ble Seamen, that &s;olicit refre&s;hment from her repleni&s;h't Har|bours, which extend them&s;elves &s;outhward to the River <HI>St.
<PB N="4" REF="3">Matheo,</HI> in twenty nine degrees, odd minutes; &s;o dilates to <HI>Luck I&s;land,</HI> near <HI>Roanoak</HI> on the promontories of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in thir|ty &s;ix degrees north latitude (now called <HI>Albemarle</HI>) a large and &s;pacious &s;ettlement, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome two or three thou&s;and inhabitants; upon a fertil Soil, and a rapid River, who&s;e Bar by rea&s;on its &s;o &s;treight and &s;hallow, a Ve&s;&s;el of con&s;iderable port and burden is deny'd admittance into the bowel of the Collony.</P>
<P>But the late and flouri&s;hing &s;ettlement lies yet more &s;ou|therly, in and about thirty two degrees, odd minutes; pa|rallel with <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in <HI>Pale&s;tine:</HI> and equals the height of <HI>Bermudos,</HI> upon the na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">igable Rivers of <HI>Cooper,</HI> and <HI>A&s;hly,</HI> formerly known by the names of <HI>Wando,</HI> and <HI>Kiawah<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> And there is a Bar al&s;o, tho unde&s;ervedly calumniated by prejudi|cate per&s;ons, who would if po&s;&s;ible unhinge the &s;ettlement when becau&s;e to emulate and envy their Neighbours pro&s;|perity. But to clear that Objection, this Bar has &s;everal Channels, and the deepe&s;t at low water is eighteen foot; and the &s;hallowe&s;t about eleaven, and twelve foot; which is depth enough for any navigating Ve&s;&s;el of three or four hun|dred tun; &s;ince at high water the tide &s;wells to &s;ix and eight foot perpendicular.</P>
<P>This is that famous CAROLINA, which his Maje&s;ty the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> has united to his Emperial Crown; &amp; by his Royal Grant e&s;tabli&s;hed it a Province; and has dignifi|ed it a Principality: which by con&s;ent among&s;t the Lords i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> transferr'd to the elde&s;t Proprie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">or. But the Propri|etors are eight in number, and their Names and Titles as followeth. <HI>Lord Chancellor Clarendon, Lord Duke Albemarle,
<PB N="5" REF="3">Earl of Craven, Lord Anthony A&s;hley Cooper Earl</HI> of <HI>Shaftsbury, Lord John Berkly, Sr George Carteret, Sr William Berkly,</HI> and <HI>Sr John Colleton Knight and Baronet.</HI> The&s;e are the Lords Pro|prietors, who&s;e Laws and Government (becau&s;e to proceed in my de&s;cription) is &s;u&s;pended till farther Opportunity pre|&s;ents to u&s;her them in.</P>
<P>So that now to de&s;cribe the pre&s;ent &s;trength of the &s;outhern &s;ettlement of the <HI>flouri&s;hing Carolina</HI> (by mode&s;t computation) we calculate their Artillery to fourteen, or fifteen hundred re|&s;olute, and gallant fighting men; under excellent conduct, and di&s;cipline; as well arm'd as mo&s;t men, &amp; as well as any Colo|ny provided with Amunition. Their Women al&s;o are health|ful, and fruitful; and their Children generally beautiful, and &s;trong. Nor have we hitherto con&s;idered the Negro Slaves, who&s;e labour proclaims the Setlers plenty; and who&s;e &s;er|vice doubles their &s;ecurity, if provided a Foreigner &s;hould attempt to invade them. Moreover it enervates the femi|nine Native, if at any time he con&s;pires again&s;t the Inhabi|tant, who can never be in&s;en&s;ible of the natural antipathy the <HI>Native,</HI> and the <HI>Negro</HI> has one again&s;t another; which the rather confirms the Setlers &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Heavens &s;hine upon this famous Country the &s;overaign Ray of health; and has ble&s;t it with a &s;erene Air, and a lofty Skie, that defends it from noxious Infection; nor is there any known Di&s;temper incident to the inhabitant whereby to terrify, and affright him; who for the mo&s;t part lives by the law of plenty, extended to the utmo&s;t limits of &s;anity: This ble&s;&s;ing one would think was encouragement enough; when if barely to contemplate the con&s;ideration
<PB N="6" REF="4">of health. But Heaven, that alwaies attends our mortal feli|city, directs to &s;tars more propicious; pointing out to us the beaten path of the Patriarchs, and led on by a glorious view of the Apo&s;tles, makes &s;hine the blazing torch of the Go&s;pel; whereby to promote the unity and harmony of piety in Reli|gion, that Vertue may grow up into divine practice, and the purity of every pious profe&s;&s;ion blo&s;&s;om, and flouri&s;h to the utmo&s;t ends of the &s;ettlement in <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>Now for as much as the motives of health and riches are inducements &s;trong enough to &s;ummons people from the ends of the earth; who &s;o ridiculous to repute them vain and unprofitable Arguments to encourage the people of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;ince from divers Inland Towns (and various Ports of <HI>England</HI>) &s;everal Natives, and Forreigners have directed their cour&s;e by pro&s;perous Stars to the florid, and flouri&s;h|ing Fields in <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>So in <HI>America</HI> (to my own ob&s;ervation) &s;everal Families have tran&s;ported them&s;elves from the ports of <HI>Barbados;</HI> but what from the re&s;t of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> I know not: yet am credibly inform'd (and from very good hands) that divers are gone, and going from thence: as al&s;o from <HI>New-Pro|vidence, Bermudos, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, New-England, Long-I&s;land, De-la-ware, Maryland,</HI> and <HI>Virginia;</HI> but great num|bers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;everal from the borders of <HI>Ireland:</HI> be&s;ides divers good Ships, with &s;ome eminent Families that are lately gone off from the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> of whom we have an accompt of their &s;afe arrival in <HI>Carolina,</HI> ble&s;t with a pro&s;perous Pa&s;&s;age. But the hopeful progre&s;s of this flouri&s;hing Country invights &s;ome Northern <HI>Americans</HI> to
<PB N="7" REF="4">emulate &s;uch &s;acred &s;anctuary as without &s;acrilidge is tole|rated to people of tender Con&s;cience. Moreover, its a &s;alubrous Air to the &s;ick, and di&s;ea&s;ed; and a generous re|trivement to nece&s;&s;itous, and abject Families; as al&s;o the a&s;&s;u|rance of &s;uch as &s;tudy to be rich. Engins &s;trong enough one would think to induce mankind to hope the pro&s;perity of this famous Settlement.</P>
<P>But the &s;ettlement of <HI>Albemarle</HI> (otherwi&s;e called <HI>Roan|oak</HI>) pre&s;ents fir&s;t to our view; and is the olde&s;t, and re|mote&s;t northern County in the fair Province of <HI>Carolina;</HI> &s;cituated about thirty five degrees, and odd minutes north la|titude: from who&s;e repleni&s;hed Meadows (as al&s;o from the more &s;outhern inhabitants) as good Beef, and Pork is &s;aved, and &s;ent off to <HI>Barbados,</HI> and other the <HI>Caribe</HI> I&s;lands; as art and indu&s;try can husband.</P>
<P>Now <HI>A&s;hley</HI> County is yet more &s;outhward, and lies &s;citu|ated thirty two degrees, forty five minutes; where the Setlers and Inhabitants toil not in &s;ummer to accommodate them&s;elves with winter's provi&s;ion: becau&s;e hitherto they have con&s;idered it u&s;ele&s;s, and altogether unnece&s;&s;ary for the Planter to employ his hands, and &s;trength, where Nature &s;o li|berally &s;tocks them with Herbage: &amp; the winter, becau&s;e &s;o &s;oftened with a moderate Air, repre&s;ents it much of the ca&s;t and temperament with our <HI>March</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and that's as much as to con&s;ider it the relique only of a milde, and &s;hort winter; or rather the &s;urprizal of an approaching &s;pring, that breathes forth to iniciate the &s;ummer: which if barely to contemplate, reanimates the vital &s;ences; and &s;olidly to po&s;&s;e&s;s, refre&s;hes both Native and Inhabitant. And here it
<PB N="8" REF="5">is that their Ships are built, and dre&s;t up by <HI>Bermudian</HI> hands, the mo&s;t approved Marriners; and a general error if not the be&s;t navigating Ships in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>And now by way of Advice; the fir&s;t thing requi&s;it and nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;etler to embrace, is to fall Timber, and to clear the Ground (which is rea&s;onably undertaken, as by an <HI>Adverti&s;ement</HI> in the la&s;t Paragraph) as &s;ome already have done, and planted Potatos, the Ca&s;&s;aida Root, Yams, Ed|dies, Carrots, Cabbidges, Onyons, Turnips, Par&s;nips, Shelots, (but they grow naturally there) Colleflowers, Artichokes, Musk-Melons, and Water-Melons; be&s;ides Wormwood, Nep, Scurvy-gra&s;s, Rue, Mead&s;weet, Trefoil, Cinquefoil, Ele|campane (Annis, Cububs, and Cardamome Seeds) Radi&s;hes, and Hor&s;e-Radi&s;hes; Mellelot, Angellica, Arch-Angel, Ro&s;e|mary, Thime, Lettice, Spinage, Sweetmarjarum, Sommer &amp; Winter&s;avory, Endive, Succory, Hopps, Water Cre&s;&s;es, Cena, &amp; China Root, with other Druggs, &amp; Saxafrage, Sa&s;&s;afras, and Sa&s;&s;aperrilla: be&s;ides divers other Vegetables without num|ber: &amp; Licoris beyond di&s;pute mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity thrive admi|rably well there; for in many places its a moi&s;t bottom, and an open ground, becau&s;e lying &s;o near the Springs, and in a gravelly &s;oil, little or nothing differing from <HI>Wor&s;hop</HI> in <HI>Not|tingham&s;hire;</HI> where they dig up the be&s;t Licoris in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, all &s;orts of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grane, as Wheat, Rye, Barley, Peas, Beans, Oates, Lentills, Fitches, and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, with other <HI>European</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Roots, and Plants; which <HI>Carolina</HI> beyond di&s;pute with &s;mall indu&s;try will produce as large, and as good as the World has. For you are to con&s;i|der, what by Art, and the Law of Nece&s;&s;ity we compel to
<PB N="9" REF="5">grow in a cold climate; nature of her &s;elf protrudes, and thru&s;ts forth there; becau&s;e of the &s;overeign warmth from this generous latitude. Nor is the heat at any time &s;o pre|dominant whereby to &s;uffocate the air with intemperance, becau&s;e de&s;tinated under the temperate Zone, which par|takes neither of the Extreams of the one, or the other; and which al&s;o invights every thing to vegetate with admirable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The next thing worthy our con&s;ideration, is their plenti|ful Eating; becau&s;e having their accomodation very cheap within them&s;elves; where Beef two years &s;ince was &s;old at twelve &s;hillings a hundred, and Pork at the rate of &s;ixteen: &s;o that Cattel (you may read) begins to be plentiful, and Hoggs of a prodigious encrea&s;e. There is a Gentleman, one Mr. <HI>Andrew Percival,</HI> the now pre&s;ent Agent to the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> (I know the <HI>Gentleman</HI> very well) who by his own indu&s;try (Providence guiding) has rai&s;ed and advan|ced from One Hundred Head of Cattel, to more than One Thou&s;and, in le&s;s than &s;even years; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e Cattel very fair, and large-headed Bea&s;ts, now grazing up and down in beautiful Savana's; little or nothing inferiour to our <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Meadows. Yet be&s;ides Mr. <HI>Percival,</HI> there are &s;everal other indu&s;trous Setlers, and Planters, that pro&s;per very well; though not having by much &s;o large, and &s;o con&s;ider|able a &s;tock to begin with.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are Barrows (which by rea&s;on of the &s;uperabundant plenty of Ma&s;t, and Roots in tho&s;e parts) that &s;ome have weighed three, and four hundred weight a|piece; and &s;uch had the <HI>Lady Yeomans,</HI> as I am credibly in|formed
<PB N="10" REF="6">who had Four Hundred Hoggs in a Herd, and Five Hundred Turkies in a drove; be&s;ides Dunghil Fouls too numerous to relate without &s;u&s;pition. And which Plantation of hers, con&s;i&s;ting of one thou&s;and five hundred Acres, was by the indu&s;try of one Mr. <HI>James Moore</HI> (an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|man) cleared from Charge in &s;ome three years time; and with the natural produce of the Country only: which am|plifies the great fertility of the &s;oil, that together with the encrea&s;e of Beef, and Pork, which if well &s;aved, and &s;ent off to other Parts (as &s;ome has already been &s;ent to <HI>Barba|dos</HI>) mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity bring in con&s;iderable Profit.</P>
<P>So that now &s;ince the arrival of Captain <HI>Dunbar</HI> (di&s;|patch't from <HI>England</HI> with Pa&s;&s;engers in the <HI>Richmond Frigot</HI>) the Vineroons and Inhabitants there bu&s;ie them&s;elves very much about planting of Vineyards, to make Wine; and dre&s;&s;ing of Oliveyards, to get Oyl. But &s;ome go upon Cotten, and other &s;ome propound to go upon Silk, becau&s;e having the Mulberry Tree in every angle of the Province: and upon Tobacco, &s;ome already have made their attempts, with admirable &s;ucce&s;s; for upon due examination, its little or nothing inferiour to <HI>Virina.</HI> Hemp&s;eed, and Flax al&s;o has been &s;owed, and yields admirable produce; which great|ly encourages the Manufacture for Linnen, as al&s;o for Sail|cloth and Cordidge.</P>
<P>Upon Honey &s;ome have &s;trong inclinations, when be|cau&s;e having &s;uch variety of Flowers (and Blo&s;&s;oms) that invights to accommodate the Laborous Bee; where, as by experience, they become &s;o prolifick, as frequently to &s;warm four times in a year; and &s;uch was the encrea&s;e from one
<PB N="11" REF="6">&s;ingle Hive, brought over from <HI>Bermudos (tho Half of them were lo&s;t at Sea)</HI> that within le&s;s than two full years, Captain <HI>Morris Matthews</HI> (<HI>an indu&s;trous Gentleman, who mannages Lievtenant Collonel</HI> James Colleton<HI>'s Plantation</HI>) had a pro|duce of more than Ten Hives; be&s;ides a <HI>Pre&s;entation</HI> made to the <HI>Governour</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome are thinking to intangle them&s;elves with the con&s;ideration of Rape, and Lin&s;eed for Oyl: but the <HI>In|dian-Natives</HI> get a &s;weet Oyl out of the <HI>Hickery Nutt,</HI> which is much of the nature of our <HI>Engli&s;h Walnutt;</HI> but not &s;o racy, nor the Kernel &s;o plump, and plea&s;ant; and this Oyl they &s;ell for Beads and Trifles of little or no value: which Oyl may be much more improved, and &s;ub&s;tituted in lieu of <HI>Oyl Olives.</HI> So that &s;taple Commodities of <HI>Carolina</HI> will be <HI>Wine, Oyl, Silk, Hides, Wool, Tallow, Honey, Bees-wax, Tobacco, Hemp, Flax, Linning</HI> and <HI>Wolling Cloth; Pitch, Tar, Cordidge,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ts for Shipping:</HI> be&s;ides an additional Manufacture is that of the <HI>Camlet Gote,</HI> intended thither by the Right Honourable the <HI>Earl of</HI> SHAFTSBVRY, as a new Encouragement to animate the people to In|du&s;try.</P>
<P>Here are very tall, large, and &s;trait Timber-Trees <HI>(the World has not better)</HI> and &s;uch is the <HI>A&s;h;</HI> the <HI>White,</HI> the <HI>Red,</HI> and the <HI>Live Oak:</HI> but the <HI>Cyprus Tree</HI> grows to an amazing bigne&s;s; as al&s;o the <HI>Walnutt,</HI> and <HI>Hickery</HI> or <HI>American Wal|nutt,</HI> already expre&s;t. Here al&s;o are &s;tately and tall <HI>Cedars,</HI> both White, and Red, that cover the Earth. And the <HI>Pine,</HI> with the <HI>A&s;p,</HI> and <HI>Poplar,</HI> that grow to an incredible mag|nitude: be&s;ides &s;everal other <HI>Timber Trees,</HI> that I cannot at
<PB N="12" REF="7">pre&s;ent remember. There is al&s;o the <HI>Birch,</HI> the <HI>Beech,</HI> the <HI>Willow,</HI> the <HI>Sallow,</HI> the <HI>Alder,</HI> the <HI>Elm,</HI> the <HI>Sicamore,</HI> the <HI>Mulberry,</HI> and the <HI>Figg Tree;</HI> but they grow every where: and the <HI>Ma|ligatoon,</HI> &amp; <HI>Peach</HI> is common, without Cultivation; yet no bet|ter Stone Fruit is ob&s;erved in <HI>Europe,</HI> than what naturally grows wild in <HI>America. Vines</HI> al&s;o &s;pread them&s;elves to ina|mour the Trees in every Wood: and <HI>Strawberries</HI> &s;trew them&s;elves in every Field. But <HI>Violets,</HI> I had almo&s;t forgot them, becau&s;e the Inhabitants depre&s;s them, by treading them under foot; yet they, with various other Flowers, perfume the Air. And <HI>Ro&s;es,</HI> they &s;prout up &s;o plentifully in every Plantation, that the Planters them&s;elves are think|ing therewith to make Fences. And where all other Roots and Fruit Trees thrive to a Miracle; as the <HI>Orange Tree, Lemon Trees,</HI> and <HI>China Orange Trees, Quince Trees, Cherry Trees, Ap|ple Trees, Pear Trees, and Prickle Pears,</HI> that bear twice a year. Then there's the <HI>Almond,</HI> lately &s;ent over to plant; and <HI>Ta|merinds, Eldern, Goosberries, Curran Trees, Ra&s;sberries, Pome-Citrons, Pome-Granats;</HI> and &s;ome &s;ay <HI>Plantins,</HI> and <HI>Bonano's.</HI> Certainly this Climate is de&s;tinated to &s;olace the Native <HI>A|merican,</HI> and with the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven to refre&s;h the &s;olicitous <HI>European.</HI></P>
<P>But it may be &s;ome will expect a Collection or Breviary of tho&s;e <HI>Indian Kings</HI> on the Main of <HI>America;</HI> meaning &s;uch Nations as are mo&s;t Con&s;iderable (and border upon the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Settlements) which I &s;hall readily impart unto them, as far as my Ob&s;ervation and Information directs to: but the Extent of the Province of <HI>Carolina,</HI> from <HI>Luck I&s;land</HI> north|ward, to <HI>St. Matheo</HI> &s;outhward, is Seven or Eight Degrees:
<PB N="13" REF="7">and in that &s;pace there are many &s;mall Nations remote from the Settlements, of which no account hitherto hath reached us. However, I'le fir&s;t begin with <HI>Albemarle</HI> River, that lies in <HI>Roanoak,</HI> and is the extream Northern Settlement in <HI>Carolina;</HI> upon which head of the River the <HI>Tu&s;carories</HI> dwell; and he's a <HI>Sagamore,</HI> or great Emperor of many Kings. But towards <HI>May</HI> River (and <HI>St Matheo</HI>) were the <HI>We&s;toe's,</HI> a po|tent and war-like people, who&s;e Kings are called <HI>Paracou&s;a's,</HI> and <HI>Warawan&s;es:</HI> but the Native <HI>Indians</HI> inhabiting in &amp; near to the pre&s;ent Settlements have only <HI>Cockawa&s;es,</HI> and are an effeminate people, and incon&s;iderable as to number. A Per&s;on of Honour that has travelled among&s;t them, mu&s;ters them up but to &s;even, or eight Nations; and of &s;everal &amp; diffe|rent Languages; &s;upine, and of a &s;oft Nature; yet of good natural Parts, when to con&s;ider their &s;alvage Education, and the little advantages they have of Conver&s;ation: a broken uncultired, and unpoli&s;h't People in Government; and &s;uch as formerly were cha&s;ed from the Mountains, and compelled to &s;eek &s;anctuary in &s;olitary Places; nor does any Nation among&s;t them exceed Fifty Bowmen, as by the following Account.</P>
<P>The <HI>Santeahs,</HI> which inhabit northward upon the rapid River <HI>Santee;</HI> they mu&s;ter but thirty Bowmen. And the <HI>Itawans</HI> upon <HI>Cooper</HI> River, formerly known by the Name of <HI>Wando;</HI> they con&s;i&s;t but of twenty Bowmen. Next to them are the <HI>Kiawahs,</HI> that dwell upon the skirts of <HI>A&s;hley</HI> River; they reckon them&s;elves but forty Bowmen. More &s;outhward to them are the <HI>Stonoes,</HI> upon the River <HI>Stonoh,</HI> adjoyning to <HI>Edi&s;to;</HI> which mu&s;ter but &s;ixteen Bowmen.
<PB N="14" REF="8">And tho&s;e upon <HI>Edi&s;to</HI> to &s;outhward, they &s;eldom or never exceed ten Bowmen. But the <HI>Cu&s;&s;o's</HI> to the &s;outhward of them, and planted upon <HI>I&s;hepoo</HI> (now called <HI>Colleton</HI> River) are the greate&s;t Nation hereabout: yet they report of them|&s;elves to be, but not to exceed fifty Bowmen. Then there's the <HI>Helena's,</HI> and they are a Nation yet more &s;outher|ly, that border upon the Banks of the Navigable River, <HI>St Helena;</HI> under conduct of a <HI>Warrawan&s;aw.</HI> And the&s;e War|riers by computation are but thirty Bowmen, and no more. (In all) Two Hundred and Fourteen Bowmen; and perad|venture to live One Hundred Miles di&s;tant from North, to South; nor do they conver&s;e, nor well under&s;tand the Lan|guage of one another. Nor dwell they in Towns, but in &s;traggling Plantations; often removing for the better con|veniency of Hunting, for that's their general Exerci&s;e, and a great part of their Maintenance; and which al&s;o &s;o propagates their Health, that &s;ome of them live to &s;ee their Third, and Fourth; nay their Fifth Generation.</P>
<P>Yet it's improbable they &s;hould ever grow numerous, becau&s;e the Women de&s;toy their Bellies with the decoction of a certain Bituminous Root, that naturally and plenti|fully grows every where among&s;t them; which Root occa|&s;ions Stirility. And this ancient Cu&s;tom, becau&s;e practi&s;ed from Generation to Generation, is &s;o rivited into the faith of their Females; that neither Art, nor Argument can pre|vail upon them to relinqui&s;h this Barbarity of de&s;troying their Bellies, till arriving at the Age of twenty &s;even (or thereabouts) and then they fancy to them&s;elves that their Children (at &s;uch years) will grow mo&s;t active, vigorous,

<P>For the Lords Proprietors (of who&s;e Laws and Govern|ment I'le only touch upon) have thought it &s;o much their own Intere&s;t, and Pre&s;ervation to make the people of <HI>Ca|rolina</HI> as ea&s;ie as po&s;&s;ible can be con&s;i&s;tant with any Govern|ment; and have parted with &s;o much of their Rites, and Powers (which his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> by his Patent Royal has con|ferred upon them) that &s;hould it &s;o happen they could for|get their own Intere&s;t; yet is it out of their Power (mean|ning the Proprietors) to do the meane&s;t Setler any wrong. For the principal Power is lodged in an A&s;&s;embly; and this A&s;&s;embly is called the <HI>Grand Council,</HI> and <HI>Parliament;</HI> in which the Power of the Proprietor is &s;o cautiou&s;ly ballan|ced by the Nobility, and Commons elected into the &s;ame (by them&s;elves) that it would be more than difficult even in the executive part of the Government for the People thereby to receive any Detriment.</P>
<P>Nor is there any <HI>Court of Ju&s;tice</HI> in <HI>Carolina</HI> but what has its proper Judges by them&s;elves elected, and &s;itting there to di&s;pence them Ju&s;tice; in which every &s;tate and condition of the people finds redre&s;s.

<P>All the&s;e, and other Rites (which are many more) guarded by the primitive unalterable Con&s;titutions of the Country, to which every new Setler &s;ub&s;cribes at his fir&s;t arrival, if provided he approve thereof; and which by direction of one of the Fundamentals is publickly, and &s;o|lemnly to be read at the opening of every <HI>Parliament;</HI> to fix them &s;teadfa&s;tly in the Hearts, and Minds of all the Mem|bers, that they may do nothing in dimunition; nor contrive any Alteration of tho&s;e Fundamentals, which before they approved of: to which purpo&s;e they are al&s;o numbred, that at lea&s;t there may be none added, nor any embezled.</P>
<P>So that the <HI>Parliament</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of the Proprietors; &amp; No|bility; who are either <HI>Landgraves,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;ica's,</HI> made by colla|tion of a certain number of privilidg'd Lands under Grant from the Lords Proprietors; having an Heriditary Right of Ce&s;&s;ion in <HI>Parliament,</HI> as al&s;o the Repre&s;entatives of the Commons elected have, that are &s;ent to &s;it in Parliament.

<P>And the Parliament thus qualified, and con&s;tituted out of the precedent Dignities, and Commons afore&s;aid; have Power to enervate bad Practices, and encouridge good Laws; to &s;tudy and contemplate the Promotion and

<PB N="25" REF="13">(by the Fundamental Con&s;titutions) is alwayes elected.</P>
<P><HI>But Fortune</HI> (&s;ome will object) <HI>made not all men of one pitch' nor has &s;he rank't every man in one &s;tation; nor pre&s;cribes &s;he to every man a Co-equality in degree an&s;werable to the praecedent Qua|lifications; what then, becau&s;e we are not all Lords, mu&s;t we there|fore be denyed the benefit of the Conce&s;sions.</HI> No &s;urely, any man may better inform him&s;elf, if when to con&s;ult the KINGS Royal Grant to the Lords Proprietors; which ex|plains to every Subject an inherent Propriety, and Birth-right intail'd upon him; to which the Fundamental Con|&s;titutions agree: and where its well enough explain'd with|out Fraud, and Ambiguity; that the Electors, and Setlers in <HI>Carolina,</HI> are by vertue of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Grant made capable according to the Tenour, and Soccage of <HI>Ea&s;t-Greenwich</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI> which enables them thereby to give, be|queath, alien, intitle, or di&s;po&s;e of all, or any part of Lands, Goods, Chattels, and Heriditaments; when, and where, and to whom they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Another Branch of the Government is, that a general Liberty for people of tender Con&s;cience be alwayes tolera|ted without exception, or limitation. And the rather to &s;trengthen the nerve of this Toleration, the Lords Proprie|tors have confirm'd it in their Fundamentals: and where fur|ther Provi&s;ion is al&s;o made, <HI>That no man Compel another to his Wor&s;hip:</HI> nor gives it encouragement that any man double his own Faith whereby to dige&s;t the Formalities of a foreign Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<PB N="26" REF="14">to own One God (or Supream Being) the Maker of Heaven, and Earth; and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the ever-living Son of God, is the divine Saviour of Mankind, and the World. So that as the Fundamentals have cautiou&s;ly provi|ded for a Pious, &amp; Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; they have al&s;o made provi&s;ion that no Profe&s;&s;or give another Interruption; &s;o that they have ballanced their Clemency as equally as they could, whereby to di&s;pence to all alike.</P>
<P>And where the Form (out of an implicit Faith) it zea|lou&s;ly adorated, pre&s;uppo&s;ing it Life; whereby the Venera|tor con&s;olates him&s;elf by the Contemplation of &s;o dark a Vi&s;ion; yet &s;o great is the Charity, and Law of the <HI>Conce&s;|&s;ions</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;e, that the Peaceable Profe&s;&s;or of this diffe|rent Per&s;wa&s;ion, may u&s;e it as an Argument to defend his Confe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that when to &s;atisfie him&s;elf with his own Ap|probation, it matters not though probably indi&s;pencible with another man's Opinion.</P>
<P>And to the&s;e Privilidges of a pious Profe&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Con|ce&s;sions</HI> them&s;elves are Arguments, and Inducements &s;trong enough to encourage the mode&s;t, and &s;ober Profe&s;&s;or, who&s;e Faith if it &s;tand firm on the Ba&s;is of Scripture; or if fra|med by the Principles of moral Precepts; the good pre&s;idents of &s;uch as practi&s;e Self-denyal; the Oracles and In&s;piration of the holy men of God; as the Apo&s;tles, the Patriarchs, and the Prophets, who&s;e &s;ublime Speculation &s;urmounted the glittering Orbs, to the beautiful &s;eraphick &s;ociety of Angels, where the Divine&s;t dwells; who al&s;o dwells in the Hearts of Believers, to di&s;member and break down the Monarchy of Sin: which glorious Victory gives us Triumph over Death, and leads Captivity captive.

<HEAD>Advice to Carolina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fundamental Being, and Well-being of all good and whol&s;om Government, depends meerly upon the Providence of God; to which when &s;ubjoyned the Piety of the Magi&s;trate, it admits of a double Duty; to God fir&s;t, then to the Magi&s;trate, under who&s;e Government we pro|pound, and expect peaceably to live, and enjoy the Ble&s;|&s;ing of Liberty; which Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in the propriety of what God in his Wi&s;dom intails upon Po&s;terity, and intitles the inherent Birthright of every man born into the World; which hereafter I &s;hall endeavour to explain, and the ra|ther becau&s;e none among&s;t you &s;hall pretend to that impli|cit Plea of Ignorance.</P>
<P>Give me leave therefore to advice you to con&s;ider the Foot&s;teps of Age, that invades our pre&s;tine flouri&s;hing Youth, whereby we cannot with vigour (and agillity of Body) perform that in act, and power; which in Youth we accom|pli&s;h't almo&s;t as &s;oon as projected. But tho&s;e Defects are &s;upplied by &s;ober, and moderate advice of Councel; and
<PB N="29" REF="15">the Scriptures tell us, <HI>that in the multitude of Coun&s;el there is &s;afety;</HI> yet not that I think my &s;elf worthy to advice you, though peradventure the Characters of Age have &s;uper&s;cribed a le|gible date; and time if I mi&s;take not has &s;uperanuated this mortal Fabrick, whereby what I intended to have told you by word of Mouth, con&s;trains me now to commit that to paper; le&s;t retention of the one part, deprive you the op|portunity of the other.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much therefore as every &s;ingle Subject is, or ought to be a Ruler, or Governour over his own Dome&s;ticks; more properly &s;uch is he that &s;tands in a publick Capacity; and &s;uch is the Maje&s;trate, who by the Law of Religion, and Ju&s;tice is bound in principles of Honour, and Con&s;cience to &s;acrifice his E&s;tate, and if need require his Life too, for the good of his Country: for that end, we ought to con|&s;ider tho&s;e proper and adequate mediums that intitle us to the&s;e &s;upereminent Privilidges, which as <HI>Engli&s;h men</HI> we claim: and then to ruminate and contemplate &s;uch pious Means, and Endeavours by the Law of Vertue, and Chri|&s;tianity, as are mo&s;t requi&s;it, whereby to accompli&s;h them. On the other hand, omitting to challenge them, they by little and little will dwindle away, &s;o in proce&s;s of time &s;eem le&s;s; and at la&s;t become totally obliterated, that the future Generations will not know them to be.</P>
<P>No man therefore in my Opinion is born only to gratifie him&s;elf, but is made in one capacity or other in&s;trumental to &s;erve the Country wherein he inhabits. The Piety whereof if &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, as a <HI>gnomen</HI> directs the Pa|tient to its proper Agent. And &s;ince Ends, and Beginnings have a like fate, and period. The appropriated ends there|fore
<PB N="30" REF="16">and the beginings of our Ble&s;&s;ings &s;pring properly and &s;pontaneou&s;ly from pious indications; which a&s;&s;igns it a Duty to our divine Creator. Then to expre&s;s our Loy|alty without Hypocri&s;ie to our Soveraign Lord the KING, as al&s;o our Fidelity to the <HI>Lords Proprietors;</HI> when becau&s;e to in|tail upon us (and Po&s;terity) the flouri&s;hing Fruits of an Inhe|ritance in <HI>Carolina;</HI> which we may as naturally and proper|ly expect, as the ends of the Creation prede&s;tinates Life the glorious Pro&s;pect, and &s;urveigh of the Creature.</P>
<P>And <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> &s;ince &s;o great and &s;acred are the Ends of <HI>Government,</HI> &amp; the Priviledges of <HI>Parliaments</HI> as &s;acred, where|in every Member, and Delegate thereof is permitted to &s;peak, and freely to &s;peak without he&s;itancy what he in him&s;elf &s;hall hononrably think in reference to the good, and well fare of his Country whereof he him&s;elf is a Member. I exhort you therefore as <HI>Engli&s;h men</HI> to <HI>challenge</HI> to your &s;elves this Native Privilidge, and the rather becau&s;e when to con&s;i|der your loyal Qualifications to &s;uch inherent Rites, which all <HI>Engli&s;h men</HI> in <HI>Carolina</HI> naturally have, and are freely born there to; or if otherwi&s;e, they arive from foreign Ports, and not tho&s;e of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> yet they equally &s;tand in the pro|&s;pect of this Ble&s;&s;ing, though mode&s;tly to think them&s;elves in the remote&s;t capacity.</P>
<P>And this royal Privilidge naturally &s;prings from a Prero|gative Grant of our gracious Prince, as in the <HI>Patent;</HI> and not only to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-born in <HI>England,</HI> but &s;uch others al&s;o as fall in with the <HI>Conce&s;sions</HI> of <HI>Carolina.</HI> For you are to con|&s;ider that in his Maje&s;ty's Charter or Royal Grant to the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> there makes no di&s;tinction betwixt tho&s;e his native Subjects born in <HI>England;</HI> and tho&s;e others implanted and born in <HI>America.</HI> And as there can be no <HI>inter
<PB N="31" REF="16">Regnum</HI> in King&s;hip, &s;o the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have provided in the <HI>Fundamentals,</HI> and upon &s;erious con&s;ideration the <HI>Coun|cil</HI> and <HI>Parliament</HI> have re&s;olved, <HI>That no man be di&s;inherited his Birthright, except his Offence exceed the limit of a Pardon.</HI> And becau&s;e this Privilidge &s;hines from the Prince him&s;elf, the more it confirms and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">rengthens the Obligation; except to di&s;loyal, and &s;uperlative ingrates and others, who&s;e perfidy detects their fidelity, and would nouri&s;h them&s;elves with In|famy; were not &s;uch deprived the natural encouridgment of the Country.</P>
<P>Now peradventure &s;ome &s;uch Antichri&s;tian Runagado's of Religion and Loyalty, tacitly recide conceal'd among&s;t you; meaning Pretenders to Sanctity who &s;helter, and hide them&s;elves under the Government, till opportunity pre&s;ents to di&s;play their more infamous Lives. Such Loyalty hangs meerly on the Slit of a Pen, and the be&s;t of their Religion &s;tands on the Tip of their Tongues. The&s;e men therefore when di&s;covered, its not ami&s;s I think that all &s;uch Hereticks of the Weal Publick be expun|ged all vertuous Society. So that if when di&s;countenanced by the Maje&s;trate, and the well-meaning Planter; their Hy|pocri&s;ie will make but a &s;lender progre&s;s, and get as &s;mall growth in the Colonys of <HI>Carolina,</HI> as the boa&s;ting <HI>Roman</HI> thought to gain Honour from the <HI>Senators</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> when to magnifie his own illu&s;trous Extraction; and decry <HI>Cicero</HI>'s, becau&s;e to &s;pring from the &s;hrubs of a Cottage. Now its true, every thing mu&s;t have a begining; and <HI>Carolina</HI> though but now in the blo&s;&s;om, yet &s;he may live to bring forth more <HI>Cicero's,</HI> than boa&s;ting <HI>Thra&s;o's;</HI> and in time grow up to &s;uch compleat maturity, that her Pro&s;perity will be emulated by tho&s;e on the Continent.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="17">
<P>Where note <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> you are to con&s;ider, that as the King's Royal Grant gave Birth to <HI>Carolina;</HI> &s;o it gives Power to the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> to make what &s;utable provi&s;ion they them&s;elves think fit whereby to conduct, &amp; improve the Pro|vince. Which rightly to interpret; the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have already given demon&s;tration of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> good endeavours in &s;etling the Colonys there; which appropriates a double obli|gation, if the people wi&s;e enough to improve it; and I hope they will, otherwi&s;e they forfeit their Gratitude to their Prince; and their Reputation if any to the generous intenti|on of the <HI>Lords Proprietors.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have unanimou&s;ly corre&s;ponded to &s;ettle this Province of <HI>Carolina;</HI> &s;o by the <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> they do promi&s;e the Planters to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch good, and whol&s;om Laws among&s;t them; whereby the <HI>Go|vernment,</HI> as the People, may be ble&s;t. Which if an&s;wered by the Careful Indu&s;try of the Planter; the i&s;&s;ue may alike prove profitable: and the rather if they propo&s;e to proceed upon <HI>Wines, Oyles, Smyrna Cotten, Rice,</HI> and <HI>Indego;</HI> as al|ready begun upon. And as <HI>Silk, Almonds, Dates, Currans, Ra|&s;ins, Sena, Je&s;&s;emy,</HI> and <HI>Rubarb</HI> are intended. But the Pro|vince naturally produces the <HI>China Root, Sa&s;&s;afras, Sa&s;&s;ape|rilla, Snakeweed,</HI> and that famous Vegetable called <HI>Calubria</HI> (in who&s;e &s;eedy Pod the <HI>Coochenial Fly</HI> germinates) is already tran&s;ported, and thrives beyond Report. Be&s;ides which, there are many and various other profitable <HI>Plants, Druggs,</HI> and <HI>Roots</HI> de&s;igned the en&s;uing progre&s;s of &s;ome of the principal <HI>Projectors;</HI> which in due time may fall in with the rea&s;on of the people in general, to make them more Rich, and Happy; than otherwi&s;e their pre&s;ent Pro&s;pect directs
<PB N="33" REF="17">to: which to in&s;pect, its nece&s;&s;ary they con&s;ult the natural propen&s;ity of the Soil, whereby to enable the <HI>Planter,</HI> if &s;olicitous after the Profits.</P>
<P>But <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> whereas one material circum&s;tance was omitted in the <HI>Pre&s;ent State of Carolina;</HI> I thought requi&s;it and nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert it in the <HI>Advice;</HI> and that is, <HI>whereas the pre|&s;ent Lords Proprietors of</HI> Corolina <HI>out of a &s;ingular tenderne&s;s to en|courage the people coming on, as al&s;o the Planter already &s;etled there, have ratified, and confirmed fifty Acres of Land to be e&s;tated for ever upon every individual Setler, or Setlers; he or they paying only one penny an Acre as a Quit Rent to the Lords Proprietors after two years time, So out of a &s;erious and judicial con&s;ideration, and re&s;pect to the Setler, and others intending to &s;ettle there; the &s;aid Lords Proprietors have agreed among them&s;elves, that who&s;oever &s;ets dowm as a &s;etler in</HI> Carolina <HI>may contract with them here to become purcha&s;ers, at the rate of five Pounds Sterling for one hundred Acres; and &s;o to take up as much as they plea&s;e, and &s;tand acquitted forever of any Quit Rent, by the bare acknowledgment only of a</HI> Pepper Corn (<HI>or</HI> one Grane of Indian Corn) <HI>once a year, if when thereto required.</HI></P>
<P>So that <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> if you &s;tand obleiged in more than a &s;ingle capacity, in a double acknowledgement you ought to an&s;wer it; and the Expedient will hardly prove grevious; for if when to con&s;ider that the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> acquire on|ly the reading the <HI>Fundamental Con&s;titutions</HI> at the <HI>general Ce&s;sion,</HI> or opening of every <HI>Parliament;</HI> the rea&s;on you are to con&s;i|der is, <HI>That the Laws being read, and made publick; the Interpre|tation thereof will appear the more ea&s;ie.</HI> And often to imprint them in the minds of the people, their frequent and con&s;tant u&s;e will in&s;inuate into the Ignorant. Otherwi&s;e, how can he be &s;aid to &s;in, that never tran&s;gre&s;t: nor can that People
<PB N="34" REF="18">be manife&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, where there's no known Law to offend.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fundamental Con&s;titutions</HI> therefore being to be read at the opening of every <HI>Parliament,</HI> its my Advice <HI>Gentlemen</HI> that you ob&s;erve this Decorum, <HI>That his Maje&s;ty's Royal Grant be al&s;o praecedently read before the Con&s;titutions;</HI> and the rather, be|cau&s;e to furni&s;h every Maje&s;trate, and other inferiour Officer with Arguments to enervate the Prejudicate (if any) and &s;uch Emulators of Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">oue as &s;tudy to arre&s;t, and would if po&s;&s;ible &s;ubvert the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> them&s;elves. Moreover, it will &s;trengthen the Nerve of Unity, and Friend&s;hip of &s;uch as labour to promote the Pro&s;perity of <HI>Carolina;</HI> and &s;up|pre&s;s the Endeavours of malicious Agents, that would &s;tifle if po&s;&s;ible the Welfair of the Settlement. So that as the te|nour of this Formality nothing in it &s;elf degenerates from Loyalty; the Clemency, and Benignity of your Prince were a Sin to &s;u&s;pect: con&s;equently an Evil unpardonable to dought the Honourable Intention of the <HI>Lords Proprietors.</HI></P>
<P>The re&s;idue <HI>Gentlemen</HI> are only &s;ome indige&s;ted Particulars that point to the Growth, Conveniency, and Manufacture of the Country; the Regularity of Living, and Reforma|tion of Life: the Medium for Manners, and the good and happy i&s;&s;ues of Pro&s;perity to the Settlement, and its long Duration. The Incorporating of Towns, and enabling them with &s;uch &s;overaign and who&s;ome Laws, and Privi|lidges as may neither hurt the Planter, nor terrifie the Coun|try man; nor rai&s;e ambitious hopes in Artizan or Cirizen to &s;well Corporations with unbounded Charters, that may bring an inconeniency upon the bordering Colonies.</P>
<P>The introducing of Studds (from a good &s;train of Hor&s;es)
<PB N="35" REF="18">are of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity; where note, every man of Abi|bility ought to endeavour it. And &s;uch al&s;o as cultivate, and labour the Ground for encrea&s;e of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grain, de&s;erve a &s;ignal Encouragment. The building of Ships, and other Ve&s;&s;els for Tran&s;portation: and erecting Bridges for Hor&s;es, Carts, and Carridges; are al&s;o worthy your &s;erious con&s;i|deration. So to lay out large, and regular High Wayes, and to rai&s;e formidable, and durable Fortifications; with many other requi&s;it Circum&s;tances, and Conveniences me|rit a re&s;pect. But the&s;e will fall in cour&s;e; and are more properly tran&s;mitted to the mature Gravity, and deliberate Con&s;ideration both of <HI>Council,</HI> and <HI>Parliament;</HI> &s;o draw on to a Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But I hope <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> you'l excu&s;e my Brevity (and my Errors too, when you meet them) its true, I pre&s;ent you but with a &s;hort pro&s;pect of &s;o glorious a Country, that beyond di&s;pute is inferiour to none on the Continent. And truly &s;uch were my Cautions, as cautiou&s;ly kept me clo&s;e to the truth of di&s;covery; which has been handed to me by &s;everal good, and worthy <HI>Gentlemen;</HI> but principally from a Per&s;on of Honour, and Quality (a Setler among&s;t them) who&s;e generous nature, and freedom to di&s;cour&s;e the Coun|try (and furni&s;h me with all or mo&s;t of his Di&s;coveries) de|&s;erves a Recompence beyond my Acknowledgements: which with Gratitude I would readily publi&s;h to the World, but his Commands obleidge me tacitly to conceal him.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I &s;hall leave you but one Caution more, (the re&s;t I'le huddle in &s;ilence) and that is, to be cautious of your &s;elves, whereby to think no di&s;honourable Thought; for I reckon it a Maxim in Philo&s;ophy, and I'me &s;ure its
<PB N="36" REF="19">within the Rules of <HI>Chri&s;tianity: That every man &s;tudy the Prin|ciples of Hone&s;ty.</HI> For to be di&s;hone&s;t within our &s;elves, is to doubt the Faith of others; &s;o at la&s;t our Scruples redounding too oft upon us, hone&s;ty it &s;elf will be brought into &s;u&s;picion; and the Prudence and Ju&s;tice of men in Government, but Toys, and Trifles of the times to play with. This contagi|on let every man labour to &s;uppre&s;s, becau&s;e its a Child of Ingratitude; and Ingratitude's a Sin of that nature, that Heaven can hardly pardon. Wherefore <HI>Carolina</HI> beware of Ingratitude, and think no thought di&s;honourable; nor doubt the Faith of tho&s;e that &s;treneou&s;ly labour to do you good. Reverence your Creator with a holy Fear; and with a na|tural Love be charitable to your Country: with an awful re&s;pect give your Services to the <HI>Proprietors;</HI> and with a Loyal Duty your Obedience to your <HI>Soveraign,</HI> whom <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> pre&s;erve to enlarge his Empire, and &s;trengthen the hands of the pre&s;ent Undertakers.</P>
