<HEAD>The Propo&s;itions of Prince <HI>Charles</HI> to the Earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI> their Ingagement at Sea, and a dangerous Fight thereupon.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VPon the neer approach of our Fleet to the revol|ted &s;hips, the Princes Mariners began to mutiny; <HI>His Highne&s;s cau&s;ed a Councell to be called, &amp; advi&s;ed with his Officers of a &s;peedy &amp; facile way to unite the &s;aid &s;hips; and it was agreed, that every chief Officer in the &s;hips &s;hould declare, that His Highne&s;&s;e had procured</HI> 6000. li. <HI>in Gold, which they &s;hould have amongst them, with many other promi&s;es and per&s;wa&s;ions, that the treaty would end all differences, both by Sea and Land, and then they &s;hould come off with more honour, then accepting of an Act of Indempnity now; and finding that the Saylers were &s;omwhat pacified for the pre&s;ent, the Prince &s;ent a Me&s;sage to the Lord Admirall, declaring his great di&s;like that his Lord&s;hip &s;hould endeavour any way to draw His &s;ervants from Him, requiring him to de&s;i&s;t for the future to do the like, and come and joyn with Him; which doing, He would procure a pardon for him from the King His Royall Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The L. Admirall an&s;wered, that he takes it in di&s;honor that either in him&s;elf, or any others, there &s;hould be the lea&s;t thought of his breaking the trust repo&s;ed in him; ac|quainting his Highne&s;se, that if he were expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t extremity that is incident to man, he would ne|ever di&s;sert the</HI> Parliaments <HI>&s;ervice; and being in a good
<PB N="5" REF="4"> condition at Sea, his advice to the Prince was, to come &amp; joyn with the</HI> Parl. <HI>but its thought nothing will be effected till its known how the treaty goes, and we hear that Sir</HI> T. Lunsford <HI>hath bin lately di&s;patcht privately from the</HI> Brill <HI>for the I&s;le of</HI> VVight <HI>upon &s;ome Me&s;sage to the King, or for &s;ome in&s;tructions or advice from tho&s;e that attend his Mai. this treaty.</HI></P>
<P>By other intelligence we likewi&s;e hear, that M. <HI>Mur|rey</HI> is gone for <HI>England,</HI> but upon what De&s;ign as yet. we cannot hear.</P>
<P>Some of our &s;hips ride within two leagues of the revolted &s;hips, with whom we would fain ingage, but as yet cannot; for the <HI>Hollander</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ecuring tho&s;e revolted &s;hips of the parl. of <HI>England</HI> (a &s;ervice which in &s;ome mea&s;ure might well be expected at their hands) by holding a neutrality, &s;ay they will pre|vent acts of ho&s;tility neer unto their parts, though it were never &s;o many for promoting the affaires of the Parliament. Some a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Volunteers is &s;aid to be expected from Denmarke which hath beene long &s;poken of and is &s;till likely, to be as &s;lowly performed for we hear of none that come to the revolted &s;hips, but &s;ome few which fled out of England, who are like to have as good a match by comming over to join with them, that are like to mutiny among them&s;elves as the Hollanders had by coveting and engro&s;&s;ing the new Gold that of late they got out of England, or as tho&s;e which adventured 7000 li. Armes to recrute Duke Hambletons forces, which were taken the la&s;t week going for Scotland. Some action hath happened between the two Fleets, upon the Princes indeavour to &s;ayl from <HI>Gory,</HI> and two of his &s;hips in danger of &s;in|king.</P>

<P>Letters from the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> &s;ay, that the King hath lately received a me&s;&s;age from <HI>France,</HI> which re|pre&s;ent things there in a very &s;ad condition, as to him|&s;elf and friends, and that the Queen cannot b ing about her De&s;ign for <HI>England,</HI> the Engli&s;h quarrel beginning to be <HI>a la mode de France.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty is po&s;&s;e&s;t with the &s;ad condition of the Scots, yet &s;aith, that their Conquerors in the North are worthy of unparallel'd honour, who&s;e further tran&s;actions and Declaration therein, he much expects and accordingly will make his Conce&s;&s;ions in the main, which is not to be looked for till the 40 dayes are almo&s;t expired.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that his Maj. hath given his po&s;itive an&s;wer to the &s;econd Bill, and hath al&s;o given his royall word to pa&s;&s;e the &s;ame; and that He is very well &s;atisfied in judgment, with the A&s;wer from the Divines, to his pa|per for Epi&s;copacy, which was</P>
