<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THat you may not be impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e <HI>Accounts,</HI> which I perceive &s;ome Ill Men do with a malicious De&s;ign indu&s;triou&s;ly pro|mote, concerning <HI>the pre&s;ent State of</HI> New-England; I have thought it my Duty to Communicate to you what Intelligence I have received from thence.</P>
<P>You may plea&s;e to be Informed, that above a year ago, whil&s;t Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> who acted by an Ille|gal and Arbitrary Commi&s;&s;ion, under the late King <HI>James,</HI> was executing his Tyranny (as by their De|claration publi&s;hed at <HI>Bo&s;ton, April</HI> 18^t^h. 1689. does more fully appear) over the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> in that part of the World began a War upon them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> affirmed (how truly God knows) that they were encouraged &s;o to do, not only by the <HI>French,</HI> who inhabit that Continent, but by Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> that &s;o they might de&s;troy King <HI>James</HI> his Enemies. A &s;mall party of <HI>Indians</HI> began the War, &s;ome of which were &s;eized by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but Sir <HI>E.</HI> &s;et them at liberty, with many favours, which did not a little augment the Jealou&s;ies of the People; and it is &s;aid the&s;e very <HI>Indians</HI> have done a great part of the Mi&s;chief &s;ince &s;u&s;tained by the Inhabitants there. Whil&s;t the&s;e things were a do|ing, Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> did all that po&s;&s;ibly he could to keep People Ignorant of Affairs in <HI>England:</HI> Yea, &s;ome were impri&s;oned for di&s;per&s;ing the Prince of <HI>O|range</HI>'s Declaration, which was &s;tyled by &s;ome a <HI>Seditious Pamphlet,</HI> tending to <HI>Rebellion.</HI> This, notwith&s;tanding the Prince his Declaration, (In|telligence from <HI>England</HI> at the &s;ame time al&s;o ar|riving, that in <HI>Hull, Dover,</HI> &amp;c. the Illegal Go|vernours were &s;eized on) did &s;o In&s;pire and Ani|mate great multitudes of People, as that they &s;e|cured Sir <HI>E.</HI> and his Arbitrary Complices, who had been their Oppre&s;&s;ors, re&s;erving them for &s;uch Puni&s;hment as <HI>the King and Parliament of</HI> Eng|land &s;hould think meet for them: And this they did that all the World might &s;ee they acknow|ledge a dependance on <HI>England,</HI> as by their Char|ters they are obliged.</P>
<P>They &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e Per&s;ons to be great Crimi|nals, who had either pro&s;ecuted <HI>Quo Warranto's</HI> again&s;t their <HI>Charters,</HI> or pretended Surrenders when there were none, or had levied Moneys on the Kings Subjects, without any con&s;ent of the People, or of their Repre&s;entatives; and this too in tho&s;e Colonies, again&s;t who&s;e Charters no Judg|ment was entred, or legal Surrenders made, but an Arbitraty Power &s;et over them.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t notice of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty (then Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>) his Declaration, before ever they know what the Event of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">ld be, they readily Embarqued them&s;elves in that Glorious Cau&s;e which is for <HI>Religion, Liberty, and Property.</HI></P>
<P>And immediately upon their hearing that the Prince was King of <HI>England,</HI> they did with the greate&s;t Alacrity Proclaim him their King in <HI>New-England:</HI> And this they did of their own accord, without any Order from hence requiring it of them.</P>
<P>After this (as Letters from thence inform) the <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom Sir <HI>E. A.</HI> had been &s;o favourable, burnt &s;everal (&s;ome of them con&s;iderable) Plantati|ons in the Ea&s;tern parts of the Countrey, killing or taking Captive &s;ome &s;cores of them; of which as yet we have not a full and particular Account: Al|&s;o the Fort of <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> being de&s;erted, was &s;ometime in the hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> but the Ma|&s;ter of the la&s;t Ship that came from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> relates, That now there are neither <HI>Indians,</HI> nor <HI>French,</HI> nor any other in that Fort, it being demoli&s;hed by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateer, who was lately on that Coa&s;t, and has taken away the Guns which were in it.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o credibly reported, That the <HI>New-Eng|landers</HI> had a Fight with the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t: And that their Enemies were Routed, not one <HI>Indian</HI>-Enemy to be &s;een or heard of for &s;ix weeks before the la&s;t Ve&s;&s;els came from thence.</P>
<P>In a Letter from <HI>Bo&s;ton, October</HI> 16. 1689. writ|ten by a good hand, are the&s;e words, <Q REND="margQuotes">The <HI>Indi|ans</HI> do now and then &s;ome hurt in our Plantations, but of late little, for there is an Army of <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> with two or three hundred of our Friend-<HI>In|dians</HI> gone out again&s;t them, and have beaten them. Al&s;o there is an Army of other <HI>Indians</HI> call|ed <HI>Mohawks,</HI> which are going out again&s;t them, &s;o that in a &s;hort time an end may be put to this trouble.</Q></P>
<P>Another Letter written by a Per&s;on worthy of
<PB N="2" REF="2"> Credit, (dated <HI>October</HI> 21.) giveth a further (and indeed a very remarkable) Account of the pre&s;ent State of Affairs there, which I have therefore cau|&s;ed to be tran&s;cribed; the words are the&s;e.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P><HI>Sir,</HI> Among our other Calamities at this day afflicting of us, we are extreamly intangled by an <HI>Indian</HI> War, which hath ruined &s;ome Heathe|ni&s;h <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations in the Northern and Ea|&s;tern Parts of the Countrey; but we have an Ar|my now in the pur&s;uit after tho&s;e Enemies, who affirm (as our Captives e&s;caped from them inform) that they are encouraged by &s;ome Gentlemen in <HI>Bo|&s;ton,</HI> vigorou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute the War upon us. By a marvellous Providence the mo&s;t Mighty and Warlike Nation of the <HI>Indians,</HI> namely, the <HI>Mo|hawks,</HI> who dwell three or four hundred miles to the We&s;tward, are become implacable Enemies to the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> under who&s;e Patronage and Encouragement our <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies do &s;hroud them&s;elves. The&s;e <HI>Mohawks,</HI> which are the Ter|ror of all about them, have kindly offered to give a De&s;tructive Vi&s;it unto our Enemies, when their hand's in at the &s;laying of the <HI>French,</HI> whom they have already &s;laughtered many hundreds of, and we are every day waiting for the I&s;|&s;ue of it.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, That the&s;e <HI>Mohawks</HI> had been many of them perverted unto <HI>Popery</HI> by the endea|vours of the <HI>French Je&s;uits</HI> among&s;t them; but &s;ome while &s;ince a noted Je&s;uit pretended to work a <HI>Mira|cle</HI> for their Confirmation in the <HI>Roman Catholick Re|ligion;</HI> and told them, That God was angry at them for their making no more Demon&s;trations of their Zeal for his Religion: and therefore as a token of it, &s;uch a day the Sun would be black. Before the day came, the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> many o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> opportunity for &s;ome Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and acquainting them with their Expectations of this Miracle, the <HI>Dutch</HI> told them, Every Child among&s;t them could foretell as much as that came to; for an <HI>Eclip&s;e of the Sun</HI> was to happen on that day: But (&s;aid they) let the Je&s;uit make the Sun black a day before, or a day after, and then believe all he &s;ays.</P>
<P>Hereupon they were &s;o terribly di&s;ta&s;ted at the Je&s;uits going to put a trick upon them, that they have re&s;olved to Renounce what little Po|pery they had, and have &s;eriou&s;ly applyed them|&s;elves to &s;ome Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters, who&s;e In&s;tru|ctions they &s;eem to imbibe with affections that invite us to con&s;ider upon &s;ome further Expedi|ents for their Conver&s;ion.</P></Q>
<P>Thus that Letter.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal Letters, dated <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, directed to &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality in <HI>London,</HI> from the the Honourable <HI>Simon Brad&s;treet,</HI> who is the pre&s;ent Governour at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> which inform of the great Deva&s;tations made by the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> (that having been the chief Seat of the War) and in <HI>Hamp&s;hire;</HI> and &s;ome mi&s;chief they have done (tho not much) in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony: But the three Colonies of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Plimouth,</HI> and <HI>Connecticot,</HI> (which were whil&s;t they enjoyed their Charter-Govern|ment called the <HI>&V;nited Colonies</HI>) have by a joynt concurrence &s;ent out a con&s;iderable Force again&s;t the Common Enemy in two Bodies; they could not come to a pitcht Battel with the <HI>Indians,</HI> who&s;e manner is to skulk in the Woods, and to do their mi&s;chief by &s;everal Parties. The &s;ame Honoura|ble Per&s;on (together with the Council in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) writes, that they are not &s;ecure from an Attack by the <HI>French,</HI> who (as they hear) have con&s;iderable &s;trength in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> but by the help of God, they will endeavour to pre&s;erve and defend their Maje&s;ties Intere&s;t, as well again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> as any other Enemies to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o, That &s;ome in <HI>Albany</HI> fearing an Attack from the <HI>French,</HI> having fir&s;t made their Applicati|on to <HI>New-York,</HI> could not be &s;upplyed from thence, they &s;ent to the pre&s;ent Government at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> for A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and Order has been taken by the Con|currence of the three Colonies for the rai&s;ing of a Company to be &s;ent to <HI>Albany,</HI> to enforce and &s;trengthen the Garri&s;on there: For the &s;everal Go|vernments of the Colonies in <HI>New-England,</HI> hold them&s;elves concerned to intend the &s;ecurity and pre|&s;ervation of their Maje&s;ties Intere&s;t throughout that whole Countrey. And divers particular Per&s;ons (&s;uch is their Loyalty and Affection to their pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties, King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI>) have been willing to advance of their own E&s;tates, to|wards the charge thereof, upon the publick Credit, &s;ome beyond their Abili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters"> They moreover write, That &s;ome Per&s;ons who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">rned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">te unhappy Government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">der Sir <HI>E&punc; A.</HI> &s;eei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">em|&s;elves di&s;appoitned in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> hopes of rai&s;ing their Fortunes upon the ruines of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> People of <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> manife&s;t their di&s;affection, not only to the pre|&s;ent Government there, but in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o, &s;ome of them having been &s;o impudent as to expre&s;s their Expectations and De&s;ires, that the late King <HI>James</HI> would be re&s;tored again; and have done what they could to Royle the Inhabitants, by rai&s;ing and fo|menting fal&s;e Reports concerning the pre&s;ent State <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">f Affairs in <HI>England:</HI> But the People (as well as tho&s;e who are now in Government there) are &s;ted|fa&s;t in their Loyalty to their Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties.</P>
