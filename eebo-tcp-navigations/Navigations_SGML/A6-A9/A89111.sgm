<HEAD>A MESSAGE Sent to Admiral Vantrump From The High and Mighty Lords the States General of the Vnited Provinces.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Lord Paw, Emba&s;&s;adour extraordinary from the States General of the United Provinces, hath made a large report to his Ma&s;ters, touching his Emba&s;&s;ie to the Common-wealth of England, &s;ince which he hath &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the Parliament to gra|tifie the re&s;pects and civilities u&s;ed by them towards him,
<PB N="4" REF="3">he al&s;o a&s;&s;ures them, that in all probability, the States will &s;end yet another me&s;&s;enger. Upon his report, and a mo|tion by him made to that purpo&s;e, the States have &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Lievt. Admiral Vantrump, wherein <HI>They expre&s;&s;ely charge, require, and forbid him, or any of the Fleet under his command, to meddle with, hinder, or disturb by any hostile act, any Engli&s;h &s;hip what&s;oever, not offering injury or affront to them; but to let them pa&s;&s;e freely without let or molestation, untill they have made their full re&s;olutions, touching the report made by the Lord Emba&s;&s;a|dour Paw.</HI> So that all hopes of a peace with England is not quite taken away, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong endea|vors of a hot &s;pirited party among us, who de&s;ire nothing more then to &s;ee the two nations imbroyled in a cruel and bloudy war.</P>
<P>The people notwith&s;tanding are arming every where, and every <HI>Stadt</HI> re-inforced both with Cavalry and Infan|try; even the Hague it &s;elf is made a garri&s;on; and all &s;hips fit for &s;ervice are &s;topt and entertained, although the men have &s;mall &s;tomacks to engage with your men of war, who they know want not courage to receive and en|tertain them; many of the Ea&s;t-India Fleet are rigging and preparing for war, that Company apprehending, that if matters go not according to their expectation, they &s;hal be called to an account for the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of Amboina: and for the defence of our frontier towns, we have &s;ent abroad to forraign Princes to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, who will (no doubt) be as ready to &s;upply us, as we to de&s;ire their aid, though but to &s;erve their own ends.</P>
<P>Much &s;cuffling there is among the States, for the ma|king the young Prince of Orange Governour, and very violently hath the motion been followed by all the Pro|vinces, Holland onely excepted, which &s;trongly appo&s;eth it: Count William hath been named for Lievt. General;
<PB N="5" REF="3">but many fear if this motion &s;hould take effect, he would introduce forraign forces among&s;t us, and &s;o betray our liberty, having the D. of Brandenburgh, and the Grave of Embden his brothers. But while the&s;e things were in deep con&s;ultation at the Hague, the element of fire raged in this City in a double misfortune both on the water and on the land: on the water we had a new &s;hip fired, how, or by what means we cannot certainly learn, but this I am &s;ure of, that if great pains and indu&s;try had not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n u&s;ed for the &s;peedy extingui&s;hing thereof, it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> all li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e|lihood have fired and burnt our fire &s;hips, which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> lay near them, but are &s;ince gone out to our Fleet.

<HEAD>A Letter f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">om the Downs, containing a full and perfect Narrative of Admiral Vantrumps facing of Sir George A&s;cue with a Fleet of above an hundred Sail.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 12 in&s;tant, wherein you de|&s;ire to be informed touching the tran&s;actions betwixt our Fleet under Sir George A&s;cue, and the Dutch un|der Vantrump; for your &s;atisfaction take this accompt. Some of the Scouts Sir Geo. A&s;cue had &s;ent out, retur|ned the 8 of this in&s;tant July, declaring that they had de|&s;cried above 60 &s;ail of Dutchmen in the Downs, Sir George then riding with part of his Fleet near Deal Ca|&s;tle, the other part was in the Hope, intending towards him. The enemy &s;eemed to de&s;ign an interception of that party, and then to fight Sir George. But Sir Geo know|ing they were not well provided for fight, &s;ent to them, commanding them to continue there till he &s;hould &s;end them further Order; and with tho&s;e he had (being not 20 &s;ail) he re&s;olved to fight it out, what ever Fleet &s;hould attempt to engage him, and prepared him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner he could to receive them, howbeit there was no attempt made upon him that night nor the next day, du|ring which time he received aboard him 200 foot &s;oul|diers, di&s;tributing them among his Fleet.</P>
<P>On Saturday the Dutch came in &s;ight, we conceived them to be about an hundred and two Men of War, and ten or twelve fire &s;hips; they were divided into 3 &s;qua|drons, viz. 35 &s;ail with the Admiral on the back of the
<PB N="7" REF="4">Goodwin; Three leagues Ea&s;tward of him was another &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ting of 40 &s;ail, and the third at Long&s;ands-head, which lay in a po&s;ture to intercept our &s;hips as afore&s;aid, and to keep Sir George from &s;teering We&s;t|ward. The next day being Sunday, very early, the intent of the enemy being fru&s;trated, tho&s;e &s;hips which were comming forth being returned into the River according to Order, he divided his Fleet into two parts, the greate&s;t part (con&s;i&s;ting of about 75 &s;ail) bore up directly to|wards Sir George between the Brake head, and North &s;ands head, while&s;t the re&s;t of the Fleet, being about 35 &s;ail, lay upon the back of the Goodwin, to intercept Sir George, if their Fire-&s;hips &s;hould con&s;train him to quit his anchors. But the Tide of Ebb being done, and but lit|tle wind, the enemy was compelled to anchor about a league di&s;tant from our Fleet, expecting the opportuni|ty of the next Tide of Ebb to fall upon Sir George, who knowing that both his Officers, Mariners and Souldiers were filled with courage and re&s;olution, prepared him|&s;elf for their reception. In the mean time &s;ix peeces of Ordnance were mounted on two Platforms between tween the Ca&s;tles of Deal and Sandown, which might annoy the enemy if he &s;hould engage; The Militia of the Countrey, both hor&s;e and foot, were al&s;o on their march thitherwards.</P>
<P>While&s;t all things were thus di&s;po&s;ed, and our &s;oul|diers both Seamen and Landmen, with great chearfulne&s;s and courage attended the falling on of the enemy, the wind turned, &s;o that the Dutch could not come in as they intended, and at Ebb it came to South-we&s;t, which was very di&s;advantageous to the enemy, who finding that pro|vidence fought again&s;t them, weighed, and &s;tood back a|gain to the back of the Goodwin about 5 a clock, where meeting altogether, they &s;teered away.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>I cannot omit to tell you, that above two hundred Seamen, to &s;hew their good affection and zeal to the Par|liament, came voluntarily and freely in to a&s;&s;i&s;t our Fleet, there were al&s;o divers fire-&s;hips preparing at Dover, to be made u&s;e of for entertaining of the Hollanders Navy, had they approached any nearer; They thought to have performed Wonders upon our Fleet here in the ab&s;ence of General Blake, but the Lord was plea&s;ed to di&s;appoint them, and bring to nought their Coun&s;els.</P>

<P>His Excellency Gen.

Blake hath taken divers Dutch &s;hips, fi&s;hermen and others, but no letters are yet come from his navy to con|firm it. It was conjectured by many that a &s;quadron of Vantrumps Fleet &s;ailed Northwards, but we under&s;tand &s;ince that they are all together, and are gone We&s;tward, thinking thereby to draw Gen.
