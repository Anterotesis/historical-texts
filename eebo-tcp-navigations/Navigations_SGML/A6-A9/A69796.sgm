<P>As to the Book it &s;elf, we dare promi&s;e the Reader Di|ver&s;ion and Plea&s;ure mixt with Profit, let his Genius be what it will. The Sons of <HI>Mars</HI> will with Warmth and Action read of the glorious Victories, and even envy the glittering Fame of tho&s;e No|ble Hero's that &s;leep in the Bed of Honour. The Poe|tick Fancy will be diverted with the old Fictions, like &s;weet Flowers &s;trewed over

the whole, and the grave Mythologi&s;t with their Mo|rals. The Antiquary and Hi&s;torian will find Enter|tainment in the Melancholy|plea&s;ing Remains of pa&s;t State and Glory, that were once the Scenes of the great|e&s;t Performances the Mind of man joyned to active Bodies is capable of, and reflect on the Fate of human Affairs &s;ub|ject all to Time and Chance. The Naturali&s;t will meet with the De&s;criptions of the Labours and Sports of Na|ture, and find &s;ome Account of the hitherto puzling Tides of the <HI>Euripus.</HI> Nor will the

<P>This plea&s;ant part of <HI>Greece</HI> has not always had the Name of <HI>Morea,</HI> as 'tis now commonly called; but formerly, <HI>Argos, Apia,</HI> and <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> Its Fi|gure well enough re&s;embling the Leaf of a <HI>Mulberry,</HI> or <HI>Plane-tree,</HI> gave &s;uffi|cient ground to the later Emperors of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to entitle it <HI>Morea;</HI> tho' &s;ome will not a&s;&s;ent to this, but pre|tend to derive the Name from <HI>Romea,</HI> which by a tran&s;po&s;ition of the Letters was changed into <HI>Morea,</HI> grounding them&s;elves upon this, That the <HI>Greeks,</HI> while &s;ubject to the Empire of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> and that City was &s;tiled <HI>New Rome</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which Name it kept till <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great.</NOTE>, were them&s;elves al&s;o call|ed <HI>Romei,</HI> as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Romans.

<P>As to its Circum&s;erence, Authors di&s;agree, &s;ome making it bigger, o|thers le&s;s. <HI>I&s;idore</HI> allows its Circuit to be 363.

<HEAD><HI>The I&s;le of</HI> Cerigo.</HEAD>
<P>ON the We&s;t of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> lies the I&s;le at this day commonly called <HI>Cerigo. Ptolemy</HI> named it <HI>Cythera</HI> from <HI>Cy|theron,</HI> the Son of <HI>Phenicus; Ari&s;totle</HI> calls it <HI>Porphyru&s;a,</HI> from the great &s;tore of <HI>Porphyry</HI> dug out of its Mountains; and others again <HI>Scothera.</HI> 'Tis ju&s;t again&s;t the <HI>Laconian</HI> Gulf, but five miles off the <HI>Mo|rea,</HI> forty from <HI>Candia,</HI> and has &s;ixty in circumference. It has &s;everal Rocks roundabout it, and good Ports on its &s;ides. On the South is the Port of the Fortre&s;s, which is but little frequented, becau&s;e 'tis but a narrow Bay, and lies much ex|po&s;ed to the winds: The other, which is on the other &s;ide the <HI>Dragoniers,</HI> twelve miles from the Fortre&s;s, has a good bot|tom, is deep, and will contain a great Fleet: Above all things the natural &s;hape of the Bay is wonderful, which may be &s;hut up, and where forty Galleys may lie in &s;afety. There is a Church dedica|ted to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> though no body dwells there. On the We&s;t at 25 miles di&s;tance from this Port, there is another little one called <HI>San Nicolo de modari,</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="126">
proper for <HI>Galliots</HI> and &s;mall Barks, where is al&s;o a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>There is in this I&s;le great quantities of wild fowl, but little corn, wine or oyl; and food is there very dear. There are &s;everal Villages, but of &s;mall or no account: And &s;ome Mona&s;teries of <HI>Hie|romonachi</HI> and <HI>Caloierros,</HI> of which one &s;tands upon a Rock on the right &s;ide near to the Fortre&s;s, which they call <HI>San Giovanni della Grotta.</HI> It has been hewn out of the Rock by pure labour with the mattock. Tho 'tis very diffi|cult to get up to it; yet the <HI>Greeks</HI> re|fu&s;e not that pains, when-ever the Re|ligious are to perform their Vows, which they have made to God. The &s;teep points of the Rock, affright all that look on them, for they hang over &s;o, that they threaten to fall and over|whelm tho&s;e that approach them. But for all this the Inhabitants have a great Veneration for the place, upon a belief, that St. <HI>John</HI> began his <HI>Apocalyp&s;e</HI> there.</P>
<P>The City of the &s;ame name with the I&s;le has the Title of a Bi&s;hoprick: It &s;tands upon a &s;teep Rock in a very ad|vantageous &s;ituation, having towards the Sea an E&s;planade well mounted

<P>Some fabulous Writers &s;ay, that the Godde&s;s <HI>Venus</HI> had her Birth in this place, others that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her fir&s;t days there. And was there ac|knowledged for a Godde&s;s, and there was a beautiful Temple dedicated to her; under the name of <HI>Cytherea</HI> in the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern part thereof: In which Temple was her Statue like a beautiful Woman holding in her right hand a Sea &s;hell, and as if ready to leap into the Sea. She was all dre&s;&s;ed with blu&s;hing Ro&s;es and &s;nowy Pidgeons flying around her, which &s;eemed to follow and attend her motion.

<P>'Twas in this Temple, that <HI>Paris,</HI> the amourous Son of <HI>Priam,</HI> met the fair <HI>Grecian Helen;</HI> and here they tempted each other to the fatal Rape, which armed the jealous <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and revenging <HI>Greece</HI> for the utter de&s;truction of <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;le is of no great extent, being not above &s;ixty miles; yet 'twas of great con&s;equence to the <HI>Spar|tans,</HI> when they were Ma&s;ters of it; for it was to them as it were a Rampart and a &s;helter to their &s;hips, which they &s;ent to <HI>Aegypt.</HI> They &s;ent thither eve|ry year a Pre&s;ident to regulate civil and military affairs; and the keeping of this I&s;le was then &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that in the eighth year of the <HI>Peleponne&s;ian</HI> War, the <HI>Athenians</HI> having won it, <HI>Sparta</HI> was without defence, and its Country lay open to the Enemy, till they ha&s;ted to fortifie and put Garri&s;ons in the neigh|bouring places.</P>

<P>Its Ebb and Flow is doubtle&s;s one of the greate&s;t wonders in the World, and it is fabled, that <HI>Aristotle</HI> drowned him&s;elf in it out of grief that he could not find out the cau&s;e thereof.</P>

<P>So each Moon there is eleven days of irregularity, and 18 or 19 others, that are regular. It is then irregular from the fir&s;t Quarter, to about the full Moon, and after the la&s;t Quarter it begins a|gain to be irregular.</P>
<P>During the time of its Irregularity in one natural day, that is, in twenty four or twenty five hours, there is eleven, twelve, thirteen, and &s;ometimes four|teen Floods and Ebbs, according to the ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame Father; and as tho&s;e a&s;&s;ure us, that are daily at the Mills, and find the wheels alter often in a day, as the Stream turns. So that the Flood does not come only &s;even times in a day, as the Ancients wrote, but much frequenter.</P>
<P>When the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Euripus</HI> is regular for the other eighteen or
<PB N="218" REF="149">
nineteen days; 'tis like the Ocean, and Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> that is in twenty four, or twenty five hours, it has but two Floods and Ebbs, and every day retards it one hour; as in the Ocean, it is &s;ix hours coming in, and as long going out, whether in Summer, or whether the wind be violent or calm. On the irregular days, it flows about half an hour, and ebbs three quarters of an hour.</P>
<P>All the Tides of the <HI>Euripus,</HI> whether regular, or irregular, differ in two parti|culars, from tho&s;e of the Ocean; fir&s;t, that in high water, it ri&s;es not above one Foot, and very rarely two, whereas the Ocean ri&s;es &s;ometimes eighty cubits, as in the Ports of <HI>Britain,</HI> though in the I&s;les of <HI>America,</HI> it mounts not high|er, than in the <HI>Euripus.</HI></P>
<P>The other difference, is that in the Ocean, when the water &s;inks and abates, it retires into the deep Sea, as on the contrary, it rai&s;es it &s;elf, and covers more ground, when it approaches the &s;ides. The <HI>Euripus</HI> is quite after ano|ther manner, for its Flood happens, when its waters run towards the I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> where is a much
<PB N="219" REF="149">
greater Sea; and its Ebb is when it runs towards <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> and through the Chan|nel, by which the Galleys pa&s;s to go towards <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> as a &s;horter and &s;afer way to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Between high and low water, there is a &s;hort interval, when the water &s;eems quiet and &s;till, and like &s;tanding wa|ter &s;o that &s;traws and feathers lie upon the water without motion, provided there be no wind.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar d' Arcons,</HI> who printed in <HI>French</HI> a Book in <HI>Quarto,</HI> concerning the Ebb and Flow of the Sea, has a particular Paragraph of the Tides of the <HI>Euripus.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>City of Lepanto</HI> is by the La|tins called <HI>Naupactus;</HI> by the Vulgar, <HI>Epactos;</HI> and by the <HI>Turks, Ei|nebachti;</HI> 'tis &s;ituated in the Country of <HI>Livadia,</HI> on the Edge, not far from the Mouth of the Gulf of the &s;ame Name, invironed with an high conical Mountain, on the Top of which is built a Fortre&s;s with four &s;trong thick Walls round it, &s;eparated from each o|ther by little Di&s;tances, where the In|habitants have their Dwellings; the Port is not above 60 Foot big, and which may be &s;hut up with a Chain being but narrow at its Entrance, upon which Account, but a few Ve&s;&s;els can lie there; and at &s;ometimes al&s;o they cannot get out of it for want of Wa|ter: And if the famous Pirate, <HI>Du|rach Bey,</HI> u&s;ed to &s;helter him&s;elf there with his Galleys, he mu&s;t have taken a &s;pecial Care to keep it clear.</P>
<P>In the times of Idolatrous Wor&s;hip, there were four Temples in <HI>Lepanto,</HI> dedicated, one to <HI>Neptune,</HI> another to

<P>Under the Empire of the <HI>Turks</HI> 'tis governed by a Vaivode. There are &s;e|ven Mo&s;ques, two Greek Churches which are held in great Di&s;dain by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and three <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogues.</P>
<P>If the Inhabitants want plea&s;ant Pla|ces within the Town, they have, with|out, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide near the Sea, a plentiful Stream of Water, which after having &s;erved the Powder-Mills and the Tanners of Leather, in which con|&s;i&s;ts the Riches of the Place, waters about a dozen very great Plains, and makes the Place very delightful. There is likewi&s;e round about very plea&s;ant Gardens and Fields covered with Li|mons and Orange Trees: The Soil produces a Wine that &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the Greek Wines in Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The taking of this Place was very Difficult, before the U&s;e of great Guns. In the Year 1408, it was &s;ubject to the Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but the Emperour, <HI>Emanuel,</HI> finding it too hard

a Task for him to keep it, delivered it into the Hands of the Republick of <HI>Venice.</HI> Under this new Dominion, it received a new Form, and was fortified &s;o as to be able to re&s;i&s;t a powerful Ar|my; and indeed, being be&s;ieged <HI>anno</HI> 1475, it de&s;troied thirty thou&s;and <HI>Turks,</HI> and their Army was forced &s;hamefully to rai&s;e the Siege, after having &s;ate down before it above four Months. The Inhabitants could not be better plea&s;ed with their Rulers, nor ever made more ardent Vows to be kept there and pre&s;erved from the barbarous Tyranny of the <HI>Turks,</HI> when <HI>Bajazet,</HI> 2. came to attack them by Sea and Land, with an Army of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, and brought them to the mo&s;t deplorable State that can be ima|gined. There is yet to be &s;een St. <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> to &s;hew us, that the Rights of the Republick are as well founded there as its Arms ineffaceable; and to give us Hopes, that trium|phant Republick will add to the Con|que&s;ts it has made the&s;e la&s;t Years, that of this Place; which will be crow|ned with Glory and immortal Fame.</P>
