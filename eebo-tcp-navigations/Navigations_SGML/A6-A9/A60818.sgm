<P>THE Company taking into Con&s;ideration, that the only ground of the pre&s;ent differences that are among them, hath been the entertaining of a Ship wherein one or more par|ticular Members have had Intere&s;t, and that the &s;ame hath been found by daily experience to be very prejudicial to the Company; and that no Articles have of late been ob&s;erved, no En|voices given as they ought to have been; the Accounts &s;uch only as the Company could have no check upon; be&s;ides the general damage to the Plantation by Tran&s;porting of Cedar, and other|wi&s;e, and that the entertaining of &s;trange Ships would much conduce to the benefit of the Compa|pany, as that the Company would then have due Account; None would be encouraged to wrong the Company and Plantation; the Members would agree to puni&s;h Offenders, and the whole would tend to Union in the Company.</P>
