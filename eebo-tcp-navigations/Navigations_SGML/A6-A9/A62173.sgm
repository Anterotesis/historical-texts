<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS without any other Knowledge of you, than what Fame has every where &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that I pre&s;ume to make you this Ad|dre&s;s. I may be a Stranger to your Per&s;on; but to your Name and Me|rits it's impo&s;&s;ible: Your Goodne&s;s and Vertue &s;et you before every Man's Eyes; and 'tis no ea&s;ie matter to publi&s;h any thing, and not take notice of you. He that ventures him&s;elf in Print, ought to pitch on &s;ome proper Patron to defend his Work (for &s;ure the fir&s;t Dedicator was &s;omething of a Prophet, to fore&s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of Critici&s;m,) And where can &s;uch Qualifications be &s;o happily found, as in you, where Wit and Judgment contend for Pre-eminence? Wit pleads its
<PB REF="4">Quickne&s;s and Force on all occa&s;i|ons, and Judgment its Solidity and &s;trong Rea&s;oning. So that the&s;e Powerful Con&s;iderations, join'd with humble Reflections on your Birth and Quality, would not per|mit me to think of any other Pa|tron for the <HI>Pre&s;ent State</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Al&s;o I was in hopes of &s;erving my Country, by promoting Thoughts of Travel in a Per&s;on &s;o well qua|lified (for nothing like Voyages &s;erves to further tho&s;e Inclinations) who might return home, &s;tor'd with all the Advantages of foreign Go|vernments, and &s;o become a glori|ous Reformer of his own. Mo&s;t Travellers come back only fraught with Garbs and Fa&s;hions, and lea|ven'd with the ill Cu&s;toms and Man|ners of the Places they pa&s;s thro': But you, no doubt, Sir, would agree with <HI>Lip&s;ius,</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Lanonius,</HI> where he &s;ays, <HI>Vaga|ri, Lu&s;trare, Di&s;quirere, Cogitare, hoc e&s;t ver&egrave; Peregrinari.</HI> The Merchant
<PB REF="4">in his Travels propo&s;es <HI>bonum &V;|tile;</HI> the di&s;&s;olute, rich, young, vain Fellow, <HI>bonum Jucundum;</HI> but your well-bred ingenious Gentle|man, only <HI>bonum Hone&s;tum &amp; De|cus Patriae.</HI> What Advantages Tra|vel brings to all Profe&s;&s;ions, I am &s;ure you are not ignorant of, and that there is no Arti&s;t or Learned Man thoroughly improv'd without it. The <HI>French</HI> have a Saying, That a Traveller is <HI>Homme m&ecirc;l&eacute;,</HI> a Man that is acquainted with all Nations, and who knows how to avoid the Pride of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Poi&s;on of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Treachery of <HI>France,</HI> and the Drunkenne&s;s of <HI>Flanders;</HI> al&s;o is throughly &s;atisfied, that <HI>France</HI> is a good Country to ride thro', <HI>Italy</HI> to look upon, <HI>Spain</HI> to under|&s;tand, but <HI>England</HI> to live in. The&s;e things, Sir, I am bold to mention, as farther Motives to any Inclina|tions you may have for Travel, by which the be&s;t and mo&s;t ingenions Man in the World is to be im|prov'd:
<PB REF="5">And if hereafter you &s;hould chance to reach <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> you will find it what it is here de&s;crib'd (for our Author is of unque&s;tiona|ble Reputation) a Kingdom one of the mo&s;t powerful and con&s;iderable in all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> whether it be for its Government, Force, Riches, Poli|ticks, or Antiquity; and which la&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have an undoubted Title to; the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians, Medians,</HI> and <HI>Parthians</HI> having all begun their Empires there.</P>
<P>The Author of this pre&s;ent Ac|count, was a Mi&s;&s;ionary &s;ent into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> by the King of <HI>France,</HI> to propagate his Glory and Grandeur, I believe, rather than Religion: For whoever reflects on his daily Practices at home can he believe him well inclin'd &s;o far off? But however, allowing it to be &s;o, he differs very much in his Me|thod: For there his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> are Mild and Patient (as our Au|thor has it) when at home they are
<PB REF="5">Cruel and Severe. 'Tis ob&s;ervable that he makes u&s;e of other Per&s;ons; for there they are Fawning <HI>Black-Coats,</HI> but here they are Blu&s;t'ring <HI>Red.</HI> So that to reconcile the&s;e Two to be intended for the &s;ame End, I know no better way, than by af|firming, That his Religion is Ambi|tion, and his God, Power.</P>
<P>The great di&s;tance of this King|dom of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> (which &s;ome might make an Objection again&s;t the minding of it) does but recom|mend its De&s;cription the more to all ingenious Men: For who would not be willing to be acquainted with the Laws and Cu&s;toms of &s;o remote and Polite a People, who at lea&s;t have &s;omething in 'em worthy to be imitated? Imitation being the great Concern of Life, and on which all Humane Knowledge is founded: For if you read and approve, you imitate; if you &s;ee and like, you imi|tate; if you hear and are pleas'd, you imitate; that is, it &s;inks in|&s;en&s;ibly
<PB REF="6">into you, and is always of|fering to be made u&s;e of upon oc|ca&s;ion, when Motives of meer Cu|rio&s;ity, without much Attention, are but Shadows and trivial in every thing.</P>
<P>Now as to the&s;e Travels being Authentick, I have this to &s;ay, That our Author was one of the late&s;t Travellers into tho&s;e Parts, and perhaps made the longe&s;t Re&s;i|dence there. I know, that others do differ from him in the pro|per Names of Places and Per|&s;ons; but I thought it not &s;afe to follow 'em; neither had it been ju&s;tifiable in a bare Tran&s;lator.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have done my &s;elf an Honour that none have had be|fore me; and I hope to recom|mend it the better to your Can|dour and Goodne&s;s, by its being my <HI>Maiden Addre&s;s,</HI> and which is no le&s;s humbly Offer'd, than &s;in|cerely
<PB REF="6">and hone&s;tly Meant, by him that will be glad of all further Occa&s;ions of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>A Short Introduction OF THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Was &s;ent into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in the Year <HI>1683.</HI> to labour in the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ions;</HI> where my fir&s;t care was to make my &s;elf Ma|&s;ter of the <HI>Armenian, Turki&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongues, believing that without them I could not be very &s;erviceable; I was young, and therefore had not much trouble to learn them. I have had occa&s;ion in the Accompli&s;hment of my Mini&s;try to traver&s;e many Provinces of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> I was fir&s;t &s;ent to <HI>Casbin,</HI> which was heretofore the Metropolis of the Kingdom. I employed my &s;elf there Eight Months in in&s;tructing and com|forting the Christians thereabouts; and I &s;pent the remaining part of the year in <HI>Lower A&s;&s;yria.</HI> I have run through at divers times, the Kingdoms of the <HI>Elamites</HI> and <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> little frequented by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and le&s;s known by any Relation of them. The re&s;t of my time I &s;pent in informing my &s;elf of the <HI>Manners, Situation,</HI> and <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the Countrie But that which chiefly con|tributed
<PB REF="7">to my entire Knowledge of the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was the long &s;tay I made there. At fir&s;t I pa&s;t Eight Months with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Babylon;</HI> where &s;ome Injuries being offered us by the People of <HI>Hamadan,</HI> upon occa&s;i+on of his Death, (the care of his Succe&s;&s;i|on being left to us) I was forc'd to go to Court to complain, where I &s;tay'd no le&s;s than Three Years: During which time our King was plea&s;ed to &s;end a Recommendatory Letter, on our behalf, to the King of <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> which did not go without its Effect; for we had immediate Ju&s;tice done us. It was upon this Occa&s;ion that the King did me the Honour to admit me into the number of his <HI>Gue&s;ts;</HI> (for &s;o they term all <HI>En|voys</HI> and <HI>Agents</HI> of Princes.) By means of this Quality I had admittance into the Pa|lace, which is only allowed to the great Lords of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> I a&s;&s;isted at all Audi|ences which the King gave, and had my Place a&s;&s;ign'd me at all Publick Fea&s;ts. This Prince has now &s;ent me home with Letters to our King. And his Maje&s;ty has been pleas'd to command me to make a Col|lection of my Memoirs of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> which I have done, pur&s;uant to my Duty: And I am apt to believe that the publick will not take it much ami&s;s if I oblige them with this Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<DIV2 N="1-100" TYPE="pages">
<P>MY De&s;ign being only to give an entire de&s;cription of the Pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Empire of Per&s;ia,</HI> I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf with what it has heretofore been, or the frequent <HI>Revolu|tions</HI> it has from time to time undergon, but keep exactly to my following Me|thod.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t I &s;hall &s;peak of the Kings Per&s;on, His Hou&s;hold, The Number and Employments of his Principal Of|ficers, Of his Magnificence, Diverti&s;e|ments, Revenues, and Armies.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall treat of his Political Go|vernment, The Kings Authority, His Council of State, The Power of his
<PB N="2" REF="9">Eunuchs, The E&s;tabli&s;h'd Order in Go|verning Provinces, and the Manner how the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> behave them&s;elves towards their Neighbours.</P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;hall explain their Methods of admini&s;tring Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Secular Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="4">4. What relates mo&s;t to my Mini&s;try, and what &s;eems mo&s;t important; I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e of their ancient and pre|&s;ent Religions.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the King</NOTE> therefore. Altho' the King of <HI>PERSIA</HI> be ab&s;olute Sove|reign over more than Twelve va&s;t and famous Kingdoms, yet he takes upon him no other Title than that of <HI>CHA,</HI> which &s;ignifies no more than <HI>King;</HI> yet neverthele&s;s his Subjects believe him to be the mo&s;t Magnificent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Titles.</NOTE> Potent, and Ab&s;olute of that kind in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>They call him al&s;o <HI>Alam Pena,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay <HI>The Protection and Sanctuary of all Nations.</HI> And which glorious Name is given him with no or|dinary ju&s;tice; for of all the Kings of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> none receives Strangers better, loves 'em &s;incerer, or allows 'em greater Privileges and Advantages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and the <HI>Usbeg-Tartars,</HI> who are his ir|reconcileable
<PB N="3" REF="9">Enemies, never afford him any other Title than that of <HI>Chiek Ogli,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>the Son of a Prie&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e the latter Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> have been of the Race of <HI>Chiek Sephi,</HI> Fa|ther of <HI>Cha-I&s;mael,</HI> fir&s;t King of that Branch. But the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> in&s;tead of being offended at this de&s;ign'd Affront, do chu&s;e rather to glory in it, becau&s;e that <HI>Chiek Sephi</HI> was de&s;cended from <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and Son of a Grandchild of <HI>Falma</HI>'s, only Daughter to this fal&s;e Prophet, who was be&s;towed by him in Marriage upon <HI>Mortus Ali,</HI> whom the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> believe to be his true&s;t Succe&s;|&s;or. It was this famous <HI>Chiek Sephi,</HI> who with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lords of <HI>Media,</HI> re&s;tored <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to its former Glory, after it had been invaded, and almo&s;t ruined by <HI>Tamerlan.</HI> This &s;o fa|mous <HI>Tartarian,</HI> who carried his victori|ous Arms even into the very Bowels of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> was named <HI>Tamour,</HI> and &s;irnamed <HI>Lang,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Lame,</HI> becau&s;e he really was &s;o. For this rea&s;on therefore the People took occa&s;ion to give him the name of <HI>Ta|merlan,</HI> which is but a corruption of <HI>Tamour-Lang,</HI> which he never di&s;own|ed, being the fir&s;t that ridicul'd him&s;elf
<PB N="4" REF="10">for that defect: For having taken <HI>Ba|jazet</HI> in that famous Victory of his near the City of <HI>Angorie</HI> in <HI>Galatia,</HI> in the beginning of the Fifteenth <HI>Century,</HI> he cau&s;ed him to be brought under his Pavillion, where as &s;oon as he had &s;een him, he immediately began to laugh heartily: When <HI>Bajazet,</HI> who was very far from abating any of his <HI>Pride,</HI> even in di&s;grace, and which he afterwards made good, tho' he was &s;hut up in an Iron Cage, believing this <HI>Prince</HI> in&s;ult|ed over his Misfortunes, broke out with Indignation into the&s;e Words: <HI>You need not be &s;o much puft up with this Ad|vantage you have gained over me, &s;ince You know by Experience, it is equally in the power ef Fortune to make a Slave or a Conqueror.</HI> To which <HI>Tamerlan</HI> replied, <HI>I am better acquainted with the in&s;tabili|ty of Humane Affairs than to mock at your pre&s;ent Mi&s;ery. But</HI> (added he) <HI>in beholding You and My &s;elf, I cannot forbear laughing at the fanta&s;tical choice Fortune has made of two Men to govern the Em|pire of A&s;ia, You having but one Eye, and I but one Leg.</HI> And truly this <HI>Prince</HI> ought to have been very &s;en&s;ible of the favours of Fortune, for from a <HI>Shepherd</HI> he was rais'd to force the
<PB N="5" REF="10">Walls of <HI>China,</HI> and to extend his Con|que&s;ts over the greate&s;t part of <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Greece.</HI> But his <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> knew how to profit &s;o little by his Victories, that they gave way to <HI>Chiek Sephi</HI> to re&s;tore the Empire of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> which their Father had &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent King was call'd <HI>Cha Sephi</HI> at his coming to the Crown:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Name, and the change of it</NOTE> But 'tis reported that the <HI>Jews</HI> having pra|cti&s;ed &s;ome Sorcery upon his <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> he was at length reduc'd to that langui&s;h|ing condition, that he was ready to drop down dead, when <HI>Chiek-Ali-Kan,</HI> his <HI>Etmadaulet,</HI> or <HI>Chief Mini&s;ter,</HI> di&s;co|vering their malice, advis'd him to change his <HI>Name,</HI> to prevent their ha|ving any power over him: Whereupon he a&s;&s;um'd the Name of <HI>Solyman</HI> for that of <HI>Sephi,</HI> which had belong'd to his <HI>Grandfather,</HI> and the famous <HI>Chiek Sephi</HI> before him.</P>
<P>This King <HI>Solyman</HI> is at pre&s;ent in the Twenty Seventh Year of his <HI>Reign,</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ituati|on of the King's Pa|lace.</NOTE> you enter it by two Gates, which are altogether as &s;plendid as tho&s;e of the Mo&s;que I &s;poke of before.

<P>The principal Gate into the King's Court, is call'd <HI>Alla Kapi;</HI> that is to &s;ay,

<P>The upper Story con&s;i&s;ts only of one very &s;pacious Hall,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hall of Audience.</NOTE> which com|mands all the Place: The King holds an A&s;&s;embly there the Fir&s;t Day of every Spring, to receive the Pre&s;ents and Fir&s;t-Fruits of his Officers, and to take his Diver&s;ion by the various Plays and Hor&s;e-Races, which the young Men of Quality perform in his pre&s;ence. This Hall is large enough to hold an hun|dred Men, without reckoning either the Courtiers or Souldiers that attend every-where. It is open on three &s;ides: The Cieling is of Wood very well wrought and gilded; the Wain&s;cot at the bottom of the Room of very curious Workman&s;hip, and the Walls every|where full of Painting; but which wants the Pencil of a skilful Arti&s;t, to regulate its Defects. The Cieling is &s;upported by Twelve great Pillars in Relievo, gilded, which gives it a great Lu&s;tre. This Hall is almo&s;t &s;quare, and has little le&s;s than &s;ixty feet in length:
<PB N="41" REF="30">It has in the middle a great Marble Ba|&s;on, where its heighth does not hinder its having a Fountain continually play|ing by the help of Pumps.</P>
<P>There are three other Halls of Au|dience in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Palace, which are much larger and more magnificent than this; but becau&s;e I have only propos'd to my &s;elf to give a &s;hort view of the&s;e Matters, I &s;hall pa&s;s 'em by with the King's Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, without any farther de&s;cription than that they are bewitching Places, and &s;o very Noble, than nothing can come near 'em in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gives Au|dience at 'em.</NOTE> and gives Audience to forreign Mini&s;ters.

The Cover and Padlock by which his Portion is lock'd up, are of the &s;ame Mettal; and they carry this Ve&s;&s;el about with Ceremo|ny upon a &s;ort of Hand-Barrow, en|richt with Plates of Gold.

The <HI>De&s;&s;ers</HI> are &s;erved al&s;o in Plates of Gold, but they begin always with Sweetmeats in Silver and Porcellain Ve&s;&s;els. The Entertainment is &s;erv'd up whil&s;t the King is giving Audience; and 'tis then that he gives Wine to the Lords of his Court. The Bottles and Cups they drink out of are al&s;o of Gold enam|mel'd, and &s;et with Precious Stones. They are rank'd all about the Marble Ba&s;on, which is in the middle of the Hall, and at who&s;e corners are plac'd four &s;mall Golden Casks, and four of Silver, each of which is about the weight of a Man.

<P>Sometimes Wild-A&s;&s;es have been plac'd among&s;t the&s;e Hor&s;es: For a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionary coming one day to Court to pre&s;ent a Letter from the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> was &s;o much &s;urprized to &s;ee A&s;&s;es &s;o richly accoutred, that he could not retain his Gravity, but began to laugh heartily: In&s;omuch that an Of|ficer that perceiv'd him, went very ci|villy up to him, and ask'd the occa&s;ion.

<P>The&s;e Troops,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of the Ordi|nary For|ces.</NOTE> together with the King's Guards, make no le&s;s than an Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Men, without comprehending the Gari&s;ons of Cities which are in the Heart of the Kingdom. They are all provided for out of the Deme&s;ns, and confi&s;cated E&s;tates. By this we may judge what prodigious Army the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is able to have on foot upon any ex|traordinary Occa&s;ion. He has little or no Infantry, becau&s;e they could not &s;upport the Fatigues of De&s;arts and Mountains, which <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is all over full of.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Infan|try or Ar|tillery, and wherefore.</NOTE> And they make u&s;e of little or no Artillery for the &s;ame rea&s;on; for they have no need of it to defend their Towns, which have neither Walls nor Fortifications, and therefore mu&s;t tru&s;t wholy to their Bodies. Al&s;o
<PB N="76" REF="52">none of the Ca&s;tles on the Frontiers could ever be able to re&s;i&s;t. The Fu&s;iliers I &s;poke of before, are never on Foot, but when they guard the King at home; for when they accompany him to the Wars, they are always mount|ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Battles are never regu|lar:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man|ner of fighting.</NOTE> They throw them&s;elves up|on their Enemy in round Bodies. They &s;hoot their Arrows, and then retire; but it is dangerous to pur&s;ue 'em, for they are very dextrous at levelling be|hind them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Stra|tagems.</NOTE> tho' they are flying upon full &s;peed. They are &s;ubtle, and know when to engage an Enemy, where they can divert the Water, and &s;o make 'em peri&s;h with Thir&s;t. They are al&s;o very cunning at flying to Ambu&s;cades, where they can cut their Enemy to pieces. Their Hor&s;es are ex|traordinary, for they can clime tho&s;e places? where a Footman would be &s;carce able to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> has no Forces by Sea,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Forces by Sea.</NOTE> and he only re&s;erves to him|&s;elf a Soveraignty over the Gulf of <HI>Ormus,</HI> the <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Seas. His Subjects don't love Navigation; for they have it in &s;o great abhor|rence, that they call tho&s;e <HI>Nacoda's,</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="52">that is, <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> who expo&s;e their Lives upon &s;o incon&s;tant in Element. This no doubt extreamly plea&s;es the <HI>Ar|menians,</HI> who have all the Commerce by Sea of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>'Tis a great Advantage to a Sove|raign to have &s;o numerous an Army at his command, but much greater to have it in the power of his Trea&s;ury to augment it as far as he plea&s;es. His Trea&s;ure which his Father left him has been very much encreas'd &s;ince his coming to the Crown; for I believe above Twenty Years, there has never a Day pa&s;t but there has come into his Exchequer 50000 Livres.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;ent Trea&s;ury augmented</NOTE> This is enough (without doubt) to govern his Kingdom quietly, and to augment it, if he plea&s;es, by new Con|que&s;ts. And nothing, that I know of, hinders him to put 'em in Execution but his &s;ingular Goodne&s;s: For his Power is ab&s;olute over his Subjects, who are all almo&s;t Slaves; his Mini|&s;ters are Skilfull and Active, his Coun|&s;ellors great Politicians, and well ad|vis'd; and his Soldiers valiant.</P>
<P>I believe there is not in all the World a more ab&s;olute De&s;potick Govern|ment than that of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Autho ity of the King of</HI> Per&s;ia.</NOTE> For the
<PB N="78" REF="53">King is &s;o entirely &s;uch, that he need never Regi&s;ter his Commands to have 'em executed, but di&s;po&s;es of the Lives and E&s;tates of his Subjects without e|ver acquainting his Privy-Council. I'll give you one Example in the Per&s;on of <HI>Abdel Ka&s;&s;amkan,</HI> Governour of the City of <HI>Hamadan,</HI> Metropolis of a Pro|vince in the Kingdom of <HI>Media.</HI> This Lord having obtain'd this Go|vernment by his Merit, and of which he had given &s;ufficient proofs in the charge of <HI>Divan Begui,</HI> which he had executed Nine Years, incurr'd the King's di&s;plea&s;ure, upon a fal&s;e Ac|cu&s;ation of an <HI>Arabian</HI> Merchant, employ'd by his Enemies to that pur|po&s;e. The King immediately di&s;patch|ed an <HI>Y&s;aoul</HI> or Me&s;&s;enger to command him to Court. This Fellow coming to the Governour's Palace whil&s;t he was doing Ju&s;tice, without any Cere|mony, immediately crowded into the Chamber of Audience, and in&s;olently march'd up to the <HI>Kan</HI>'s Seat, when forbidding him to &s;tir, he arrogantly acquainted him that he had di&s;|pleas'd the King. The <HI>Kan,</HI> who had all his Officers about him, and more than Four Hundred Soldiers in an ad|joyning
<PB N="79" REF="53">Court, reply'd only, <HI>I am the King's Slave; I reverence his Orders: Put in execution what you are commanded.</HI> When at the &s;ame time taking his Girdle from his Wa&s;te, he pre&s;ented it to the Me&s;&s;enger; who &s;natching it from him, in&s;tantly bound his Hands behind his Back. Then the <HI>Kan</HI> throwing his Turban upon the Ground, offer'd him al&s;o his Head: But the Me&s;&s;enger told him, that his Or|ders extended only to the &s;eizing of his Per&s;on and Goods. Which Or|der having given to the <HI>Vizier,</HI> or King's Lieutenant to read, he immediately enter'd his <HI>Haram,</HI> &s;eiz'd upon what|ever he found, and drove out his Wo|men after a very &s;hameful manner. thus his Hou&s;e being pillaged, and all his Goods confi&s;cated, he was led bound to Court, after the rude&s;t and mo&s;t ignominious manner imagina|ble. He remain'd there Nine Years as a private Per&s;on, without either E|quipage or Retinue, and without ever daring to appear before his Prince. But at length Fortune began to change in his favour,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is clear|ed by the Ruine of his Enemy.</NOTE> and the Con&s;table, who was the cau&s;e of his Misfortune, fell him&s;elf into a deeper Di&s;grace, who&s;e

The Con&s;table pre&s;ently began to ju|&s;tifie him&s;elf in denying the Fact; but the King having referr'd the Exami|nation of the Matter to the Great Ma&s;ter of his Hou&s;hould, told the Con&s;table, That if he were convicted, His and his Lieutenant's Head alone &s;hould not &s;uffice to revenge &s;o much Innocent Blood.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="54">
<P>The Second Blow was upon account of the Money he had Superintendance over;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Ac|cu&s;ation.</NOTE> for he was accu&s;ed of great Mi&s;demeanors in that Office, and of having put the whole Kingdom into di&s;order.

This &s;o nettled our Monarch, that the Death of this Lord had undoubtedly en&s;ued his Di&s;plea&s;ure, had not the <HI>Etmadaulet</HI> fell on his Knees, and im|mediately beg'd his Life.</P>

<P>The <HI>Sultan</HI> receiving neither An|&s;wer nor A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Gover|nour of <HI>Herat,</HI> made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to Court,

The <HI>Sultan</HI> finding his &s;tay vain, and being unwilling to di&s;oblige his Prince with Delays, which might &s;eem the effect of Cowardice rather than Nece&s;&s;ity, re|turn'd to his Charge without &s;o much as &s;eeing the King.</P>
<PB N="84" REF="56">
<P>In the mean time,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A famous Siege.</NOTE> the <HI>Usbegs</HI> pre&s;s'd on vigorou&s;ly the Siege of <HI>Mourg-ab,</HI> and <HI>Abdulla Sultan</HI> defended him&s;elf with no le&s;s Courage than he was at|tack'd; for having lo&s;t all hopes of Re|lief, he was re&s;olv'd to die as bravely as he could: He arm'd as many of the Inhabitants as were able, with whom he made &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful Sal|lies. But this Advantage over the <HI>Usbegs</HI> did not procure him any long Quiet; for they having receiv'd a Reinforce|ment of Eight thou&s;and Men, pu&s;h'd the Siege on with greater Vigour than before. Whereupon <HI>Abdulla</HI> not know|ing of their Recruits, attempted a &s;e|cond Sally; where being over-power'd with Numbers, he was forc'd to retreat with the total lo&s;s of the City, and &s;hut him&s;elf up in the Ca&s;tle:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Revolt of the Be|&s;ieg'd a|gain&s;t the Sultan.</NOTE> But &s;carce was he enter'd there, when the Gari&s;on and Inhabitants being tired with &s;o long a Siege, and not &s;eeing any Suc|cours come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, imme|diately revolted again&s;t him, and ad|mitted the Enemy. Thus <HI>Abdulla Sul|tan</HI> &s;eeing all Hopes lo&s;t, hearken'd to no Motives but tho&s;e of extream Jealou|&s;ie, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have all of their Wives,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">His &s;trange Re&s;olutions.</NOTE> and by which he thought to &s;ave his from Infamy: He therefore be|gan

<P>Thus having &s;een the total Extincti|on and tragical End of his Family, there was nothing more remain'd but that he &s;hould think of dying him&s;elf: Whereupon ru&s;hing with fury into the thicke&s;t of his Enemies, he made no &s;mall havock of 'em with his Scymiter; but tho' he expos'd him&s;elf to &s;o many, yet he did not meet with that Death his De&s;pair &s;ought after; for over|power'd with their Force, he at length

<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is made Captive.</NOTE> they imme|diately dre&s;s'd and bound up his Wounds, and then led him Captive.</P>
<P>The Rigours of this Slavery did not wholly appea&s;e the Hatred of his Ene|mies in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> for the Con&s;table, who had then altogether the King's Ear, employ'd the Misfortunes of the Son, for the Ruine of the Father; and to that purpo&s;e gave &s;o &s;udden and &s;ubtile a Turn to the taking of <HI>Mourg-ab,</HI> that the King laid all the fault of this ill &s;ucce&s;s upon the Father of <HI>Abdulla Sul|tan,</HI> whom he immediately depriv'd of his Governments of <HI>Merva</HI> and <HI>Ma|rouchak.</HI>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, <HI>Abdulla Sultan</HI> was not without &s;ome Con&s;olation in his Capti|vity; for <HI>Sepan Kouli</HI> Prince of the <HI>Usbegs,</HI> having no ordinary &s;en&s;e of his Valour, us'd him well, and endeavour'd many times in vain to engage him to his Service; but promi&s;ing him his Li|berty, if he could end that War &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully, which he then had with the

<P>So &s;awcy an Attempt upon the Royal Bloud, and the Trea&s;on di&s;cover'd by the <HI>Sultan,</HI> were more than was nece&s;|&s;ary to ruin the Con&s;table: But ne|verthele&s;s, the King calling in his Eunuchs again, they did not cea&s;e to augment the Di&s;turbance of his Mind, by telling him, That the Intrigues the Con&s;table had with his Aunt, might in time amount to dethroning him: And, That they thought they had rea&s;on to believe he de&s;ign'd to place the Crown on his Maje&s;ty's elde&s;t Son's Head, who was Two and twenty Years old.

Next the King com|manded the Con&s;table's Son to be arre|&s;ted at <HI>Sembran,</HI> and the Lieutenants of <HI>Kazran</HI> and <HI>Hamadan.</HI> All the&s;e Orders were &s;ecretly executed by the Eunuchs, without either the knowledge of the <HI>Etmadaulet</HI> of Council.

<P>The <HI>Etmadaulet,</HI> the <HI>Con&s;table,</HI> the <HI>Divan Begui,</HI> and the <HI>Superintendant</HI> of the <HI>Slaves,</HI> appear'd the fir&s;t before the King, being the Four Principal Officers of the Crown, when the King, not &s;o much as affording one favourable Look to the Con&s;table, gave him pre|&s;ently a &s;urprizing Pro&s;pect of his Misfortunes, which was augmented the more, when he &s;aw the Guards rein|forc'd with Two hundred Eunuchs in Arms about the King's Per&s;on. Never|thele&s;s, he endeavour'd to conceal his Concern, and took his ordinary Place next to the <HI>Etmadaulet,</HI> to whom the King had given Wine, and to two other Lords; but took no notice of the Con&s;table; which the Superintendant
<PB N="93" REF="60">of the Slaves (being the King's great Favourite) ob&s;erving, expre&s;s'd the Effects of Wonder in his Looks, and which gave the King occa&s;ion to di|rect his Di&s;cour&s;e to him in the&s;e Words: <HI>You &s;eem &s;urpriz'd</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that I take no greater notice of this Traytor; but that you may know I can do all things in due time, I command you in&s;tantly to ri&s;e, and to go cut off his Head.</HI> This Lord being frighted with &s;o &s;trange a Com|mand, immediately ca&s;t him&s;elf at the King's Feet; but in&s;tead of obtaining Mercy for his Friend, he got only the Privilege of being a Companion in his Condemnation: For the King being nettled with his Di&s;obedience, rigo|rou&s;ly commanded the <HI>Divan Begui</HI> to out off both their Heads. But the <HI>Et|madaulet</HI> a little intercepting, fell on his Knees, and with his ordinary Elo|quence having repre&s;ented to his Maje|&s;ty, That the Con&s;table might well be thought criminal, in being the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ing &s;o merciful a Prince: But for the Superintendant of the Slaves, he took only an inno|cent Liberty of interceeding for his Friend, without acting any thing con|trary to the Re&s;pect that was due to
<PB N="94" REF="61">his Commands; for that all his Pre|dece&s;&s;ors had confirmed that Law, which forbid any one to execute &s;uch Orders as this, till they had been reite|rated thrice; and that knowing of what importance it was to oppo&s;e &s;ome|times an humble Interce&s;&s;ion to their Anger, they have always allow'd of &s;olliciting their Clemency in favour of the Accus'd. <HI>Very well then</HI> (&s;ays the King) <HI>I pardon the Superintendant of the Slaves: But you,</HI> Divan Begui, <HI>I com|mand you thrice go execute my Orders; go in&s;tantly and &s;trike off that Traytors's Head.</HI> Whereupon the <HI>Divan Begui,</HI> though very unwillingly, was forc'd to go and &s;eize the Con&s;table, and to degrade him, by &s;natching off his Turban, and throwing it on the ground, when drag|ging him out of the Hall, he took off his Girdle, and bound his Hands be|hind him: The Con&s;table all the while wi&s;hing Pro&s;perity and long Life to the King, without daring to murmur any Complaints again&s;t his U&s;age; and to &s;hew his entire Submi&s;&s;ion to his Ma|&s;ter's Orders, he often ki&s;s'd the <HI>Divan Begui's</HI> Robe, and conjur'd him to en|treat his Maje&s;ty, that he would be plea&s;ed to pay his Debts, and not to
<PB N="95" REF="61">extend his Wrath to the reft of his Fa|mily, they being altogether innocent, and he only guilty. Then he de&s;ired the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to pray in, and to know whe|ther his la&s;t Hour were yet come, ho|ping always the King's Anger would mitigate. But the <HI>Divan Begui,</HI> fearing by delay to incen&s;e the King farther a|gain&s;t him&s;elf, fix'd the la&s;t Minute of his Life, by di&s;charging a Stroke into his Neck, which through Grief to &s;ee his Friend in that Condition, was not &s;trong enough to do his Bu&s;ine&s;s; wherefore the Con&s;table entreating by their ancient Friend&s;hip to di&s;patch him, the <HI>Divan Begui</HI> not being farther able him&s;elf, caus'd his Gentleman to come up, who with three Blows of a Scymetar, &s;ever'd his Head from his Body. Which done, it was immediate|ly carry'd to the King; who looking upon it with a &s;tern Countenance, cried, <HI>Very well, Traytor: Am I now a&s;leep? Am I now in a Lethargy, as you &s;ent word to my Enemies? No, no; you find I am not.</HI> Then ordering the Head to be taken from him, he turn'd him&s;elf to the Lords of his Court, and told 'em, That <HI>that Head was but the Fir&s;t of Four that &s;hould fall.</HI> Which &s;urprizing
<PB N="96" REF="62">Speech made every one tremble and look pale for fear it &s;hould be his own.</P>
<P>The Wedding that the King promi|&s;ed to the Prince&s;s his Aunt, was by the&s;e means chang'd into a bloody and frightful Tragedy; for he immediate|ly order'd an Eunuch to carry her the Con&s;table's Head; and moreover to acquaint her from him, that it belon|ged to the Husband he had made choice of for her, and that it was cer|tain &s;he had yet made no attempt a|gain&s;t his Per&s;on. Neverthele&s;s he &s;hould not be contented by puni&s;hing her only with Griefs to &s;ee her Lover's Head in a Platter, he would al&s;o have her's for reparation.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Executions were doing in the Palace, the Great Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold, and Governour of <HI>Shiras</HI> were &s;ealing of the Con&s;table's Hou&s;e.

<P>The <HI>Divan Bigui</HI> has no cognizance of Trea&s;on, for that is try'd in the inner part of the King's Palace, with|out any relation had to the Council, as I ob&s;erved before. But no Criminal whatever he be, is Sentenc'd without the King's knowledge, who mu&s;t be fully acquainted with the <HI>Sadre</HI>'s De|ci&s;ion, who always determines the &s;ort of Puni&s;hment according to the Laws pre&s;cribed by the <HI>Imans.</HI> They pro|ceed in the&s;e Courts much after the &s;ame manner with us of <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> by Proofs, Confronting of Witne&s;&s;es, and Tortures.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of Tortures in u&s;e in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> as in <HI>Europe;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of putting to the Torture.</NOTE> 1. Ordina|ry, and 2. Extraordinary.</P>
<P>Ordinary by way of Ba&s;tinadoes, which are always given in full A&s;&s;em|bly; and which cau&s;e no ordinary Terrour of their Tribunals.</P>
<P>There are many kinds of Extraor|dinary, which con&s;i&s;t al&s;o of Ba&s;tina|does, but after a manner much more Mercile&s;s and Sen&s;ible. For they &s;la&s;h the bottom of the Heels with Razors, put Salt into their bleeding Wounds,
<PB N="131" REF="79">and then make u&s;e of the Battoon; which you mu&s;t needs think is no common Torture. Al&s;o they &s;ome|times tear off the Nails from their Feet with Pincers. Sometimes they bind the Criminals to four Stakes by the Hands and Feet, and apply red|hot Irons to the mo&s;t fle&s;hy parts; and &s;ometimes they quite tear out the Fle&s;h with Pincers. If the&s;e poor wretches confe&s;s the Crimes of which they are accu&s;ed, then they de&s;i&s;t from Tortures, and proceed to Sentence: Afterwards they deliver the condemn'd to the Par|ties concern'd,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crimi|nal deli|ver'd to the Accu&s;er.</NOTE> to be di&s;pos'd of at their plea&s;ure. But if they do not confe&s;s, the Accu&s;ers mu&s;t pay the Per&s;on Tortur'd SMart-money, which is allow'd 'em according to their Qua|lity.</P>
<P>'Tis Remarkable, that they do not proceed again&s;t Murtherers till the Party intere&s;s'd requires it: So that a Child who&s;e Father has been kill'd, is at liberty to revenge or compound for his Blood, without any Check from the Court of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>When the Party intere&s;s'd will not Compound, and that he has prov'd the Murther, the <HI>Sadre</HI> determines the
<PB N="132" REF="80">Puni&s;hment, and returns the Criminal to the Parties power to take Blood for Blood.</P>
<P>The Party intere&s;s'd has none of the Goods Confi&s;cated; the Court &s;eizes upon all; whence it comes to pa&s;s, that Executions are &s;eldom pra|ctis'd when the Criminal has any Money to Compound.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story of a Brother that kill'd his Si&s;ter taken in this Crime.</NOTE> that they allow Fathers and Mothers to Stab their Daughters if they take 'em in this Crime. I &s;aw an Example of this kind at the Lieu|tenant's of the Governour of <HI>Hamadan:</HI> A Mother having &s;urpriz'd her Daugh|ter in this Act, not being able to vent
<PB N="133" REF="80">her Anger upon him who had di&s;ho|nour'd her, made her Daughter the Victim of her Indignation, who had not time to e&s;cape: For this pa&s;&s;ionate Wo|man calling her Son to her, commanded him to kill his Si&s;ter upon the &s;pot; who as ha&s;tily obeying, he had &s;o little re|mor&s;e after this Parricide, that he could not content him&s;elf with Stabbing her, but immediately cut off her Head and carry'd it home in Triumph. His Neighbours came to the Lieutenant's to accu&s;e him as a Parricide: He was &s;eized, and his Mother followed him to the Hall, where I heard all the Circum&s;tances. The Lieutenant ask'd him why he had kill'd his only Si&s;ter? He an&s;wered, He had done well, and that he de&s;erved a Reward rather than a Puni&s;hment; for in having Stabb'd an Uncha&s;t Si&s;ter, he had reveng'd the Honour of his Religion which &s;he had defil'd, and wa&s;h'd away a blot which her Crime had ca&s;t upon his Family: And then turning to his Mo|ther, he gave her a thou&s;and Bene|dictions for having in&s;pir'd him with &s;o noble a de&s;ign. Whereupon he was bid to withdraw, and his Mother commanded to &s;tand forth: Where
<PB N="134" REF="81">&s;he being ask'd her rea&s;on for what &s;he did; &s;he pre&s;ently ju&s;tify'd her &s;elf, and commended the generous Action of her Son. The end of this Tragedy was very &s;urprizing; for the Lieute|nant being then at Dinner, gave the Mother Melons and other Fruit from his Table; and after having exalted her Inhumanity, as an Heroick Acti|on, he gave her Son an Habit for being the Executioner. This &s;urpriz'd me very much, and quite took away my &s;tomach to my Meat: Which the Lieutenant perceiving, ask'd me, if we did not Judge &s;o in <HI>Europe?</HI> I told him, no. And not daring to ex|plain my &s;elf farther, and to tell him, we did not u&s;e to reward Parricides, I was fain to content my &s;elf with only offering my Opinion, That this Mother ought fir&s;t to have had re|cour&s;e to his Court for Ju&s;tice again&s;t her Daughter, and not to take &s;o much upon her without Orders. He an&s;wer|ed, that that was true; but that he was oblig'd to determine &s;o, according to the Laws of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> which made me have a &s;ecret pity for the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> that are &s;o much blinded by their <HI>Al|coran,</HI> and who are otherwi&s;e the mo&s;t

A poor <HI>Armenian</HI> Catholick being found in the Road where the King was to pa&s;s, with his Ladies, he was &s;eiz'd, and condemn'd to have his Head cut off. Whereupon the <HI>Kouler Aga&s;&s;i,</HI> who is the chief Favourite, and one of the Four great Officers of State, was commanded to a&s;&s;i&s;t at his Execution, and to offer him Mercy if he would renounce Chri&s;tianity, and become <HI>Mahometan.</HI> But the Chri&s;tian refu&s;ing his Offers, kept firm to his Faith.

<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have not &s;et Puni&s;h|ments for every Crime.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers Pu|ni&s;hments.</NOTE> They make u&s;e of a Gibbet after a very cruel man|ner; for they fa&s;ten the Patient by the Throat with an Iron Hook, and there let him hang till he peri&s;h. They have another &s;ort of Puni&s;hment yet more cruel than the former, and that is, They bind the Criminal upon a Ca|mel's Back, and then open his Belly, as a Butcher does a Sheep, and thus they lead him about the Streets with his Guts hanging out, and who will live &s;ometimes Two or Three Days in this Condition. The Puni&s;hment for Thieves is particular: They put 'em into a Ditch up to the Middle, and af|terwards fill it with Plai&s;ter, which gives the Patient exce&s;&s;ive Tortures a&s;&s;oon as it is dry.</P>
<P>Empaling is not in u&s;e, no more than Fire: They have no Wheels, but
<PB N="137" REF="82">yet they have Puni&s;hments as cruel. They lay the Patient upon a broad Board, and there ha&s;h his Body into &s;mall Pieces.</P>
<P>The Governours Lieutenants have no power to condemn to death till they have permi&s;&s;ion from the King by a <HI>Brevet.</HI> The <HI>Derogats</HI> may Ham|&s;tring, or cut off the No&s;es and Ears of Butchers and Bakers, a&s;&s;oon as ever the Lieutenant of the Policies has convi|cted 'em of &s;elling too dear, or by fal&s;e Weights. But none except the <HI>Kans,</HI> a few <HI>Sultans,</HI> and privileged <HI>De|rogats</HI> can condemn to death; which cau&s;es a great di&s;order in this King|dom; for the Thieves will be &s;ure to ravage that Country mo&s;t where they know there's none have Authority to Condemn 'em.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divan Begui</HI> (as I have remark|ed before) is the chief of the Civil Ju&s;tice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Ci|vil Ju&s;tice.</NOTE> as well as the Four Great <HI>Pon|tiffs</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> This Court is very com|modious for the Subject, for there are neither Me&s;&s;engers, Councellors, or Attorneys. Every one may exhibit his own Cau&s;e by way of Petition: Every one pleads for him&s;elf, and de|fends his own Right: They have
<PB N="138" REF="83">Cryers to command Silence; and their Audiences are always very tumultuous; and he that &s;peaks loude&s;t has com|monly the better of the Day. They never pa&s;s Judgment by Default, which is the rea&s;on that he who was in the wrong oftentimes &s;aves him&s;elf by ma|king a good Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Laws of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> by which they &s;teer their Judgments, oftentimes &s;ubject People to a great many incon|veniencies: For a Man that lends his Money is always in danger of lo&s;ing it, according to the&s;e Laws. If he to whom it is lent be of good Repute, and has no Money ready to pay, the other cannot bring his Action with|out con&s;iderable Damage to him&s;elf, for he mu&s;t pay the Tenth part of the Summ immediately, and all the Co&s;ts of Suit. If the Defendant confe&s;s the Debt, they always give him a rea&s;o|nable time for Payment. He that has the better on't pays the Co&s;ts; which Law is not ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Alcoran</HI> forbids U&s;ury;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">&V;&s;ury for|bid.</NOTE> but the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> never mind it. For Example: If they lend 100 Crowns for a Year, they compute what Inte|re&s;t they might make by it, and that
<PB N="139" REF="83">can never be le&s;s than Eight <HI>per Cent.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">However practi&s;ed.</NOTE> &s;o that they add that to the principal Summ in the Bond before-hand.</P>
<P>This Craft will &s;ignifie nothing if the Debtor be a Knave; for at the end of the Term he'll deny to have recei|ved the full Sum, and &s;o offering to lay down in Court the 100 Crowns, he'll avoid the Intere&s;t. 10 <HI>per Cent</HI> for the Judge's Box, and all the Co&s;ts of Suit.</P>
<P>This Court is very ridiculous and un|ju&s;t in re&s;pect of a Defendant that will deny his Debt, for there he is al|low'd to do it contrary to his own Hand-writing, and the Te&s;timony of the Judge, who &s;aw the Money lent, and put his Hand and Seal to the Ob|ligation: Neverthele&s;s the Defendant need but deny the Fact boldly, and the Creditor will be ordered to make Proof of the Loan, and to produce his Witne&s;&s;es, or he will be Non-&s;ui|ted. The&s;e Two things are equally prejudicial to the Creditor; for to prove any Act according to their Laws, they mu&s;t produce Seventy Two Wit|ne&s;&s;es, who mu&s;t all very near equal the <HI>Imans</HI> in Integrity, if not wholly. The expre&s;s Words of the Law are
<PB N="140" REF="84">the&s;e, <HI>That to be believ'd, the Witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t be either Imans, or Naib Imans,</HI> that is, Saints, or Deputies of Saints. There are not wanting in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> People that can equal the&s;e pretended Saints in A|dultery, Knavery, and Murther; but they mu&s;t al&s;o equal 'em in Hypo|cri&s;y, Treachery, and being wor&s;e than their Word. A <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> is never al|low'd for Evidence, and much le&s;s a Jew, Indian, or follower of <HI>Omar.</HI> Therefore you may judge in what Confu&s;ion a Creditor mu&s;t needs be, who is oblig'd to find &s;o great a num|ber of &s;uch choice Witne&s;&s;es. He ought to have lent his Money by &s;ound of Trumpet, to have got &s;o many to have prov'd the Fact.</P>
<P>I affirm that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a Plaintiff to prove his Debt; &s;o that he mu&s;t always yield him&s;elf Non|&s;uit when he commences a Suit, unle&s;s he relies upon Remor&s;es of Con&s;ci|ence, which &s;eldom or never trouble the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> e&s;pecially when they are to injure a <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI> But if he be &s;o happy to &s;ee any reluctance in his Adver&s;ary for a fal&s;e Oath, all his Good Fortune will amount but to this, that he mu&s;t compound for a Third
<PB N="141" REF="84">part, out of which the Judge will have al&s;o his Tenth. When the Debtor de|nies the Debt, the Plaintiff is at liber|ty to &s;wear it after what manner, and with what Circum&s;tances he plea&s;es, but it will &s;ignify nothing.</P>
<P>I can never remember without Hor|ror after what a cruel manner I &s;aw an Oath forc'd from a Chri&s;tian in the Province of <HI>Naxivan,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel manner of putting a Chri&s;tian to his Oath.</NOTE> where the <HI>Ar|menians</HI> are <HI>Catholicks.</HI> A Renegado made an In&s;ult upon a Chri&s;tian, and de|manded 2000 Crowns which he &s;aid he lent him upon his Word, without Wri|ting; but having no Witne&s;&s;es to prove it, he would needs put him to his Oath. And to that purpo&s;e hal'd away this poor Chri&s;tian by force to his own Church, follow'd by a Crowd of <HI>Ma|hometans,</HI> where &s;cattering of Bread all the way up to the Altar, he forc'd him to walk upon it with Two Dogs tied to his Arms, and in this manner he oblig'd him to lay his Hand upon the Evangeli&s;ts, and to &s;wear with a Thou&s;and Oaths and Impreca|tions, that were enough to frighten one, that he ow'd him nothing. This Man, who was an hone&s;t Merchant, would have willingly given him 100
<PB N="142" REF="85">Crowns to have freed him&s;elf from &s;uch a Scandal, and his Church from &s;o great a Profanation; but he might as well have offer'd a Penny to &s;atisfie the whole Sum; for he was re&s;olv'd he &s;hould drink out of the Chalice in that po&s;ture, which gave me as much unea|&s;ine&s;s and di&s;like as it did him.</P>
<P>If there be &s;o much hazard in Tra|ding or Lending Money in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> there is without doubt no le&s;s in Buying Lands or Hou&s;es; for whatever care is taken of the Contract, the Seller may deny he ever &s;old 'em; or if he owns the &s;elling, yet he may deny receiving of his Money, and &s;o put the Buyer upon proving it, which perhaps he would never be able to do.

No, an&s;wer'd I, but the Advantage I &s;hall have over you, will be &s;ufficient to prove that in this Point, at lea&s;t, <HI>Mahomet</HI> has deceiv'd you; and if he has deceiv'd you in this Point, ought you then to believe him in other Points? If he be not to be believ'd when he &s;ays that Chri&s;t was not dead, is he any more when he &s;ays that Chri&s;t is not God? But I do not pretend to prove the Divinity of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t by his Death, I have Au|thority enough from the Holy Scri|ptures, which <HI>Mahomet</HI> has allow'd in his <HI>Alcoran</HI> to have been reveal'd by
<PB N="162" REF="95">the Holy Gho&s;t to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Pro|phets, and to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> I mean from tho&s;e very Scriptures that he has commanded you to have the &s;ame re|&s;pect for as the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> 'Tis true, re|ply'd the Intendant, we do allow the Divinity of the Holy Scriptures, but not &s;uch as you have made 'em by altering them in a Thou&s;and pla|ces, to deduce Arguments to prove the Divinity of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> I know very well, my Lord, an&s;wer'd I, that this you always charge us with in all your Conferences with us: But if you will be pleas'd to honour me with the &s;ame Attention you have hitherto done, I do not doubt but to &s;hew you, That this Objection is not &s;ufficiently maintain'd. Do's it &s;uffice to con|vince us (think you) that we have fal&s;ify'd the Scriptures, becau&s;e they are found to differ from tho&s;e Cita|tions <HI>Mahomet</HI> has made in his <HI>Alco|ran;</HI> and have not we the &s;ame grounds to reproach you, that it was <HI>Mahomet</HI> him&s;elf that alter'd 'em? But to make an end of this Conte&s;t, my Lord, let us take a Third Per&s;on, who &s;hall be neither <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> nor <HI>Ma|hometan:</HI> I appeal to our greate&s;t E|nemies
<PB N="163" REF="95">the <HI>Jews</HI> in this Ca&s;e, even tho&s;e that have crucified our Saviour, the Author and Con&s;ummator of our Faith; Let them &s;peak whether they think we have fal&s;ified the Scriptures? if tho&s;e we profe&s;s are not the &s;ame with theirs? Let 'em lay before you the Holy Books, even &s;uch as they have receiv'd 'em from the Prophets, and let 'em determine if there be any difference? I am very well a&s;&s;ur'd they would not &s;ay the lea&s;t to the contrary. I know they would accu&s;e us of not under&s;tanding 'em, but ne|verthele&s;s, they would readily grant, we have alter'd nothing. By the&s;e means nothing is more ea&s;ie than to end this difference between us. There are <HI>Jews</HI> among&s;t you as well as all other Nations; and I dare be bold to affirm, That the rea&s;on that God &s;cat|ter'd this People &s;o wide in the World, was the better to give an univer&s;al Te&s;timony of the Divinity of his Son. The <HI>Jews</HI> them&s;elves, &s;aid he, inter|rupting me, were the fir&s;t that fal&s;i|fi'd the Scriptures. I know, reply'd I, my Lord, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> in many places of his <HI>Alcoran</HI> does accu&s;e 'em of it, but had he any rea&s;onable
<PB N="164" REF="96">grounds for what he &s;aid? When did the <HI>Jews</HI> fal&s;ifie the Scriptures? Was it before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> appear'd in the World? or was it after? I &s;up|po&s;e you will not &s;ay it was before <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and I in&s;i&s;t upon but Two or Three Rea&s;ons to prove it was not after. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who reproach|ed 'em of &s;o many Di&s;orders, wou'd he, think you, have omitted &s;o enor|mous a Prevarication as to fal&s;ify the Holy Scriptures? And can any one imagine, that being to quote 'em &s;o often in his In&s;tructions to Men, on the account of his Father, God Al|mighty, he would have quoted 'em &s;o fal&s;ifi'd by the <HI>Jews;</HI> for it evidently appears, that he &s;pake the very &s;ame they have in their Hands: Al&s;o you cannot think the <HI>Jews</HI> corrupted 'em after his Death, when they believ'd him an Impo&s;tor, and one that ju&s;tiy &s;uffer'd for offering to &s;educe 'em. Would not they have alter'd all the places that plainly prove him and his Apo&s;tles Holy, which he employ'd a|gain&s;t 'em.</P></Q>
<P>And now perceiving that my Ar|guments had begun to make &s;ome Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the Intendant, I added
<PB N="165" REF="96">farther, <Q>That it was plain the <HI>Jews</HI> had not fal&s;ify'd the Holy Evan|geli&s;ts, tho' they might very well have inclinations to do &s;o; neither ought this reproach to be ca&s;t upon <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></Q> Then applying my &s;elf to the Intendant, I went on in this manner: <Q>You &s;eem to &s;ay they had a pro&s;pect by this fal&s;ification, to prove the Divinity of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and if &s;o, pray, At what time &s;hould they have done it? Should it have been at the beginning of Chri&s;tianity? or was it only in the time of <HI>Ma|homet?</HI> If it had been in the begin|ning of Chri&s;tianity, it mu&s;t have been done by the Apo&s;tles, or tho&s;e that immediately &s;ucceeded 'em. But it was not done by the Apo&s;tles you grant, by demanding at every foot, the Go&s;pel as it came out of their hands. Neither was it done by their immediate Succe&s;&s;ors, is plain; For how &s;hould the&s;e Men have underta|ken to prove the Divinity of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> if the Apo&s;tles had &s;aid he was meer Man? And would not there have been Men then living, who would have contradicted 'em? The&s;e very Men that &s;aw the Scriptures in their
<PB N="166" REF="97">Purity, would they have &s;uffer'd 'em to have been alter'd by &s;o difficult a point of Faith, without any gain|&s;aying? Do you think that <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who had hitherto been able to pa&s;s for no more than meer Man, mu&s;t all of a &s;udden have become God, upon the bare Te&s;timony of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in&s;erted into tho&s;e Holy Books, and which would have been &s;o ea&s;ily detected by every body? And this Fal&s;ification has not been done in the time of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> I'm &s;ure, tho' he reproaches us with it; for does he &s;hew us any Ancient Book where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Humanity is mentioned without his Divinity? Another Re|flection, my Lord, comes in my mind. The <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> you &s;ay, have a Pro|&s;pect by this Fal&s;ification, to prove that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was GOD. Then they ought to have left in the Bible, only tho&s;e Actions that were for his Grandeur and Divinity: Such as the Prophecy of the <HI>Angel Gabriel,</HI> which foretold, That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be &s;til'd, <HI>The Son of the mo&s;t High:</HI> That he &s;hould Reign for ever in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob;</HI> and that he &s;hould deliver his People from their Sins: Al&s;o the
<PB N="167" REF="97">Miracle of his Conception by the Operations of the Holy Gho&s;t: His Birth of a Virgin: The Miracles he perform'd: His Transfiguration on <HI>Mount Tabor:</HI> His Triumphant A&s;cen|&s;ion into Heaven: The De&s;cen&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t upon the Apo&s;tles: And, His la&s;t coming in Glory to Judge the World. The <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> I &s;ay, ought only to have left the&s;e Actions in the Holy Go&s;pel; and if they had any de&s;ign to prove his Divinity by an Alteration, they &s;hould have retrench'd all the other Cir|cum&s;tances of his Life, which were Arguments of Humanity and Weak|ne&s;s: As, His Birth in a Stable; His Flight into <HI>Egypt,</HI> to avoid the Per|&s;ecution of a Tyrant: The Hunger he &s;uffer'd in the De&s;art: His Fa|tigues in his Journey he undertook for the In&s;truction of Men; and his Wearine&s;s and Thir&s;t when he &s;at at Noon upon <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well: The Tears he wept over <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> when he foretold the Mi&s;eries he &s;aw would fall upon her: Al&s;o tho&s;e he &s;hed upon the Tomb of <HI>Lazarus:</HI> The Mortal Affliction his Soul was &s;eiz'd with in the <HI>Garden of Olives,</HI> at the
<PB N="168" REF="98">&s;ight of the Torments he was a-go|ing to &s;uffer: The Prayer he made to his Father three times, to remove the bitter Cup far from him: The Humble Circum&s;tances of his Pa&s;&s;ion: And la&s;tly, His Ignominious Death. It was a Glorious and Triumphing <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> that they ought to have preach'd, and not one that could be humbled and ty'd to a Cro&s;s. The Zeal you &s;ee us have, my Lord, to maintain that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> dy'd on the Cro&s;s, &s;hould be a Motive to encline you to believe us. For el&s;e why could not we agree with you that it was <HI>Judas</HI> was Crucify'd in his place, and &s;pare our &s;elves the &s;hame of Adoring a God fix'd to a Gibbet. But 'tis this &s;hame alone which is the cau&s;e of our Glory. We Preach <HI>Je&s;us Christ</HI> Crucify'd, which is a &s;ubject of Scan|dal to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to you a Mo|tive of Mockery and Laughter.</Q></P>
<P>The Curio&s;ity the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have a|bout Religion, gives the Mi&s;&s;ionaries a great advantage over 'em. To Con|vert 'em to Chri&s;tianity, there is need of a great deal of Candour and even Temper, and little or no Pa&s;&s;ion, or over-hot Zeal. They will never be|lieve
<PB N="169" REF="98">a Man in&s;pir'd with the Spirit of God, who is govern'd by Rage and Pa&s;&s;ion. Al&s;o as they have them&s;elves a great deal of Flegm, too brisk a Method would not have its end. To make 'em &s;en&s;ible of the Contradicti|ons and Ab&s;urdities of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> has prov'd to me of great u&s;e. Al&s;o as they have the Bible and &s;ome of the Fathers among&s;t 'em, we might advi&s;e 'em to read 'em. They find out them&s;elves how different tho&s;e Hi&s;tories are from the Fables of <HI>Ma|homet</HI> left 'em in his <HI>Alcoran.</HI> This Reading has been a means God has made u&s;e of to induce many of the Greate&s;t Men about 'em to be led to the true knowledge of him and his Son.</P>
<P>From <HI>Laure&s;tan</HI> I took my Journey towards <HI>Hamadan,</HI> a City of <HI>Media,</HI> and Capital of a Province of the &s;ame Name, and chief Re&s;idence of a <HI>Be|gueler-Begui.</HI> 'Tis &s;ituate at the foot of <HI>Mount Alvand,</HI> which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Sultan Alvand,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Queen of the Mountains;</HI> becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t Fertile, and one of the highe&s;t in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> It is a branch of <HI>Mount Taurus,</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="99">which leaves it at the Town of <HI>Zen|gan,</HI> and runs even to the <HI>Per&s;ian Gulf.</HI> The famous <HI>Avicen</HI> liv'd a great while upon this Mountain to make his Ob|&s;ervation upon Simples, with which it is all cover'd over. <HI>Hamadan</HI> has 35 degrees and 12 Minutes of <HI>Polar Ele|vation.</HI> It is a very Ancient City, as may be judg'd by the ruins of a new Magnificent Temple there, and of which there remains nothing at pre|&s;ent but a very high Dome, built with Bricks, and Painted like <HI>Porcelane,</HI> upon which appear &s;ome few <HI>Hebrew</HI> Characters. Under this Dome there is a Chappel 18 foot &s;quare, where are the Tombs of <HI>He&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Mordecai:</HI> Upon the&s;e Tombs are rais'd two &s;tately <HI>Mau&s;oleums,</HI> made of a very hard Wood, and Engraven with the Story of <HI>He&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Hebrew</HI> Characters. Upon <HI>He&s;ter</HI>'s Tomb is writ, <HI>The Great Queen HESTER;</HI> and on <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s, <HI>The&s;e Mau&s;oleums have been plac'd here by</HI> Ardachir, <HI>or</HI> Ar&s;aces; But there is no Date to di&s;tingui&s;h which of the <HI>Ar&s;aces</HI> is meant. The <HI>Mau&s;oleum</HI> of <HI>Mordecai</HI> is on the right hand: It has 7 foot in length and heighth, upon
<PB N="171" REF="99">3 of breadth. That of <HI>He&s;ter</HI> is on the left, built after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, only it is a foot higher than that of <HI>Mordecai.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> keep there a great number of Lamps, which burn Night and Day. They Pray here only on their great Days. Our Hou&s;e was not far from this Temple. We were e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd there in 1684. I brought the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Patents thither, obtain'd by our King's Recommendation, and which confirm our E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>One day making a Vi&s;it about our Affairs to a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lord, call'd, <HI>Reza-Kouli-Begue,</HI> a <HI>Dervich;</HI> a Man of very good Sence, an excellent Philo&s;opher, and one that was very well read in the Holy Scriptures: He of a &s;udden turn'd all the di&s;cour&s;e upon Religion. He began by giving great commen|dation to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and &s;aid,</P>
<Q><P>That he thought it every where very conformable to Rea&s;on, unle&s;s in that place where it teaches that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is GOD. 'Tis true, reply'd I, we do acknowledge his Divinity; that Point is the Foundation of our Religion: But what amazes me is, That you &s;hould have the &s;ame thing in your
<PB N="172" REF="100"><HI>Alcoran,</HI> and yet not believe it: For, under correction, what &s;ignifies <HI>Rouh Allah,</HI> which is the word that <HI>Mahomet</HI> gives to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> This <HI>Arabian</HI> word,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arguments with a</HI> Per|&s;ian <HI>Lord, to prove Chri&s;t's Di|vinity.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays he, for I have thoroughly &s;tudy'd that Language, &s;ignifies the Spirit or Soul of God. This Spirit or Soul of God, then &s;aid I, is it di&s;tinct from God, or the &s;ame thing with him? It cannot be di&s;tinct from him, without doubt, &s;ays he. Then, reply'd I, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t be God: For what is the &s;ame thing with God is God. He &s;eem'd touch'd with this conclu&s;ion; but I extreamly com|mended his being &s;o Ingenuous as to give me the true &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>Rouh Allah.</HI> I have not met with, &s;aid I, in other <HI>Mahometans,</HI> the like &s;in|cerity; they have always given this word a different &s;en&s;e, to elude the con&s;equence I have drawn from it.</P>
<P>We all, reply'd <HI>Reza Kouli-Begue,</HI> acknowledge <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for a Divine Per&s;on, and we have for him a very great re&s;pect; when you <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> do but &s;light and vilifie our Holy Pro|phet <HI>Mahomet.</HI> You re&s;pect <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;aid I, becau&s;e you every where
<PB N="173" REF="100">meet with a Saint in his Character that moves you: but &s;hew me through|out all <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Life, the lea&s;t &s;ha|dow of &s;uch Characters. You re|&s;pect <HI>Je&s;us Christ</HI> becau&s;e you own him for a Prophet, &s;ent by God to Man; and you acknowledge him &s;uch by evident Proofs of his Holine&s;s, which you are not able to re&s;i&s;t But is there any one that can give us &s;uch an Idea of <HI>Mahomet?</HI> What has been his Conduct? What Doctrine has he taught Men? By what Miracles has he prov'd that he was &s;ent from God? What Prophets have foretold his Mi&s;|&s;ion, or his Conduct? I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t, Sir, upon any &s;hameful Cir|cum&s;tances of his Life, becau&s;e I'm well a&s;&s;ur'd that you your &s;elf do &s;ecretly dete&s;t 'em in your heart. His Conduct! No, Sir, I have too good an opinion of you, to &s;ay any thing of that. It is not from his Conduct, I'm &s;ure, that you believe him a Prophet. His <HI>Alcoran,</HI> where he has dar'd to publi&s;h his own Un|cleanne&s;&s;es, in all Ages will ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t him. And had you never &s;o many Miracles to boa&s;t
<PB N="174" REF="101">in his behalf, his Infamous Life alone, would be enough to cancel 'em all; and no Man of good &s;en&s;e would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be gain'd to his Party. But now I think on't, what Miracles can you alledge in his fa|vour? His Voyage to Heaven up|on the Hor&s;e <HI>Alborach,</HI> to whom he promi&s;es Paradi&s;e; and the Moon divided by his Fingers; but the&s;e Miracles are certainly fit for none but the blind Vulgar to believe; all Learned Men mu&s;t needs laugh at 'em. <HI>Mahomet</HI> him&s;elf acknowledg'd, that God had not given him the gift of Miracles. Now as to his Doctrine, how many Whim&s;ies are there through|out his whole <HI>Alcoran?</HI> How many Contradictions and Ab&s;urdities, op|po&s;ite even to good Manners and right Rea&s;on: Such as the World born up upon the Horns of a Bull; Angels form'd out of pe&s;tiferous Fire; Heaven compos'd of Smoak; the Sun plac'd in a Fountain of hot Water; a Blazing-Star detach't from the Fir|mament to pull down the Devils from Heaven, when they came &s;o near as to hearken to what was &s;aid:
<PB N="175" REF="101"><HI>Solomon</HI> entertaining him&s;elf with Ants and Birds; his Letters carry'd to the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> by flakes of Snow; the Devils and Birds, which compo&s;e his Armies; God &s;wearing by Figs and Bees, and ju&s;t afterwards the quite contrary, by Cows: Wine forbid in one Chapter, and allowed in another; and a thou&s;and other Ab&s;urdities of the like nature, which &s;ufficiently &s;atisfie us what this Doctrine of <HI>Ma|homet</HI> is.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t 'twas nece&s;&s;ary that God &s;hould have given Man &s;ome mani|fe&s;t and evident Sign of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s coming from him: There ought to have been Prophecies of this New Legi&s;lator, which might have en|clin'd Man's belief in him: But pray what Prophecies have there been? Which of all the Prophets has &s;po|ken of him? <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, (cry'd the <HI>Dervich</HI>) in that pa&s;&s;age where he promi&s;es to &s;end the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter, and which ought to be under&s;tood of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> for his Name was actually in the Go&s;pel, before you blotted it out.
<PB N="176" REF="102">To which I an&s;wer'd only what I had &s;aid before upon that &s;ubject; That it was without Grounds that they reproach us after that manner: That they could not prove when this Alteration was made; nor could produce any Authentick Copy where the Name of <HI>Mahomet</HI> was ever men|tion'd. I added moreover, That this Comforter promi&s;ed by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> could not be <HI>Mahomet</HI> for this rea&s;on; Becau&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter, &s;hould have taught the Apo&s;tles, and put 'em in mind of what <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> had taught 'em; and this ought to have been his principal bu&s;ine&s;s; but has <HI>Mahomet</HI> done any of this? What &s;trange Oppo&s;ition is there between his Maxims and tho&s;e of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t! Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;peaks of no thing but Mildne&s;s, Patience, Poverty, and Renouncing of him&s;elf!

<PB N="177" REF="102">in&s;pires nothing el&s;e but Rage, Violence, Pride, and the love of Plea|&s;ure. The Spirit of Truth that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> promis'd in this Pa&s;&s;age, ought to receive its Doctrine from <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> that is, The Doctrine of <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> cannot be the &s;ame. Is not this true? be your &s;elf Judge. Do not we find in the read|ing of the&s;e two Laws, an endle&s;s Difference and Contradiction? When you retire into your Cell to meditate upon Divine Matters, I &s;uppo&s;e you &s;ometimes take in your Hands our Holy Evangeli&s;ts; where, it may be, you no &s;ooner read tho&s;e Divine Maxims with &s;atisfaction, but you have immediately a mind to com|pare 'em with tho&s;e of your <HI>Alcoran, Eh!</HI> Do it in the Name of that Great God you pretend to devote your &s;elf to, by renouncing all the conveniencies of Life.

<P>It has been hitherto thought that the be&s;t way to deal with the&s;e Infidels was to make u&s;e of certain plau&s;ible Arguments adapted to their Capacities, and which they would find forcible, becau&s;e of their weakne&s;s.

<P>The chief foundation of this Con|te&s;t is about the Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> maintain it was <HI>Mortus Ali,</HI> Cou&s;in German and Son-in-Law of <HI>Mahomet:</HI> But the <HI>Turks</HI> pretend on the contrary it was <HI>Omar,</HI> of whom they &s;peak mode&s;tly in re&s;pect of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who make a kind of God of their <HI>Ali.</HI> Ob&s;erve how they &s;peak of him; <HI>Ali K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">da na midonem, ammaez Ko|da dguda na midonem;</HI> (That is as much as to &s;ay) <HI>I do not believe that Ali is God, but I cannot think him much le&s;s.</HI> A bla&s;phemous and contradictory Ex|pre&s;&s;ion at the &s;ame time, and of which
<PB N="181" REF="104">the <HI>Turks</HI> have &s;o much Horror, that they call the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> Bla&s;phemers and Idolaters.</P>
<P>The Interpretations of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> by the&s;e two Nations are altogether contrary; and therefore becau&s;e they have their <HI>Codes</HI> and <HI>Ceremonials</HI> from hence, their Laws and Ceremoni&eacute;s of their Religion are al&s;o different.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> wa&s;h before Pray|er, by letting the Water run down from the top of their Arms to their Hands; and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> quite contrary. Each defends his particular manner of Purifying, and maintains it again&s;t his Adver&s;ary with &s;o much heat, that they have both entire Volumes about it. Their Po&s;tures and Pro&s;trations in Praying are altogether contrary, and their Oppo&s;ition goes even to their Ha|bits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as I have told you be|fore, have from the <HI>Jews</HI> their legal Impurities. They believe every thing impure that has but touch'd what was e&s;teem'd &s;uch by the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="105">The mean People, and tho&s;e that be|long to the Law would not ea&s;ily be prevail'd upon to touch any thing, or eat in the &s;ame Plate with <HI>Chri&s;tians, Jews,</HI> or <HI>Indians,</HI> nay even with the Sect of <HI>Omar,</HI> as much <HI>Mahometans</HI> as they are. The <HI>Turks</HI> are not given to tho&s;e Super&s;titions; they eat indifferent|ly with all the World, and, except it be <HI>Pork,</HI> without any di&s;tinction of Vi|ands. The Courtiers and Soldiers do the &s;ame thing in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> hold,

<P>But, on the other &s;ide, the <HI>Turks</HI> have this Di&s;&s;imulation in great abhorrence; for they never change tho&s;e Habits which di&s;tingui&s;h their Religion.</P>

<P>I have heard &s;ay in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that <HI>Amu|rah</HI> &s;hould &s;end an Amba&s;&s;adour to <HI>Cha Abbas,</HI> to complain that he had &s;uffer'd this Colour to be profan'd by the Chri&s;tians.

They groan under a cruel Slavery: They are forbid the Li|beral Arts, and exerci&s;e only the mean Drudgery of Labourers, Gardeners, and Porters: They are always put up|on the vile&s;t and mo&s;t painful Works,
<PB N="184" REF="106">in&s;omuch as their continu'd Slavery for many Ages, has at this day render'd 'em Cowardly, Simple, Ignorant, and Dull; yet they &s;till retain the ancient <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Idiom, and &s;ome few of 'em can read and write it. This Language is altogether different from the modern; but of no more u&s;e than common Talk among&s;t them, for it &s;erves neither for Learning nor Commerce.</P>
<P>Their Belief is contain'd in &s;everal Skins, which their <HI>Magi,</HI> or <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> read to 'em upon certain Days; the&s;e Skins are fill'd with Fables and &s;uper|&s;titious Traditions, but which are ne|verthele&s;s kept private by their Prie&s;ts, for they make it a point of their Reli|gion not to &s;how 'em to any body; &s;o that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to know any more of their Faith, than whiat is di&s;cover'd by their Prie&s;ts; and they are common|ly &s;o dull, that there is little or nothing to be learn'd from them.</P>
<P>The modern <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call 'em <HI>Gavres,</HI> that is, Idolaters, and treat 'em wor&s;e than they do the <HI>Jews;</HI> they ac|cu&s;e 'em of wor&s;hipping the <HI>Sun,</HI> and
<PB N="185" REF="106">the <HI>Fire,</HI> But however great my Cu|rio&s;ity has been, I have been able to know but little of 'em; yet this I have ob|&s;erv'd, That they have no Images, and that they very much abhorr tho&s;e that have. When you ask 'em why they fall down before the Ri&s;ing Sun? they &s;hall an&s;wer, That they do Homage to that Creature, which is the mo&s;t perfect next to Man, that God hath made out of nothing. They &s;ay al&s;o, That God has e&s;tabli&s;h'd his Throne there, and that his Glorious Maje&s;ty mu&s;t needs merit their &s;o humble Re&s;pects. This Salutation they pay the Ri&s;ing Sun, is not particular to them, the modern <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> al&s;o make u&s;e of it by profound Reverences, and the <HI>Ar|menians</HI> by frequent Cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves. They &s;ay they believe Fire worthy of Re&s;pect, becau&s;e it is the pure&s;t of all Elements. The care they take to keep it alight, is very &s;crupulous and ridi|culous, for they dare not blow, for fear of polluting it with their Breath; and then they would believe them&s;elves defil'd, if they &s;hould chance to let fall any Filth upon the Wood they burn.</P>
<PB N="186" REF="107">
<P>They don't ob&s;erve Circumci&s;ion;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Circum|ci&s;ion.</NOTE> their Prie&s;ts pre&s;ent their new-born In|fants to the Sun, and before the Fire; and &s;o they believe 'em &s;anctified by this Ceremony.</P>
<P>They believe a Paradi&s;e,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Para|di&s;e, where.</NOTE> which they &s;ay is within the Sphere of the Sun. The Happine&s;s of their Saints con&s;i&s;ts in viewing the Sun clearly, in which, they &s;ay, they &s;ee God by Re|flexion, as in a Gla&s;s. But no body is admitted to this Felicity, 'till three Days after his death; and that is the rea&s;on they carry three Days Provi&s;ion to their Tombs, that they may nei|ther hunger nor thir&s;t. The poor <HI>Ma|hometans,</HI> and in their ab&s;ence the Birds and Dogs, profit them&s;elves by this Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>They believe Hell to be a Pri&s;on under-ground,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hell, where.</NOTE> damp and &s;tinking, be|ing every-where full of Worms, Ser|pents, and other &s;orts of In&s;ects, but above all a great number of Crows and Frogs; for 'tis the&s;e two &s;orts of Animals that they have the greate&s;t aver&s;ion for. They call Crows Me&s;&s;en|gers
<PB N="187" REF="107">and Heralds of the Devil; and Frogs, Mu&s;icians to the Damn'd.</P>
<P>The manner of examining what &s;hall be their Lott in the other Life, is very plea&s;ant: They carry the dead body out of the Town; they &s;et it up a|gain&s;t a Wall, with its face towards the Ea&s;t; then the Prie&s;ts and Parents of the Dead retire to a convenient di&s;tance, where they ob&s;erve what notice the Crows take of it: If they fall fir&s;t upon the Right Eye, (for with the Eyes they commonly begin) then it is a &s;ign of Prede&s;tination, and they play and dance about the Carka&s;s with a great deal of Joy: But if it be the Left, that's an Argument they are not pure enough to be admitted into the Sphere of the Sun; nor yet impure enough to be condemn'd to the ob|&s;cure Pri&s;on of Hell, but mu&s;t remain &s;ome time in the middle Region of the Air, there to endure the Cold, and from thence to be tran&s;lated to the Fire to be purify'd. At the&s;e Fune|rals they are &s;ad and mourn. If the Crows pick out both their Eyes, then the Prie&s;ts pronounce 'em damn'd, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="188" REF="108">having no more Eyes, they can|not view the Sun. The Funerals of the&s;e la&s;t are mo&s;t lamented.</P>
<P>They have Saints which they wor|&s;hip;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saints, and how become &s;o.</NOTE> and they &s;ay that the way to become &s;uch, is to work to purifie the Elements; to till the Ground; to cultivate the Gardens; to purge the Water of Infects; and, to keep the Fire alight. The&s;e are their daily Employ|ments. By the Principles of their Re|ligion, they are oblig'd to leave in their Wills a certain Summ, to rid the Ponds of &s;uch a number of Frogs, Toads, Ser|pents, and other In&s;ects. They al&s;o leave &s;omething for People to carry a|way the Carrion which the <HI>Mahome|tans</HI> let &s;tink in the Streets. To purifie the Air, and to pre&s;erve the Towns from Contagion, is a very pious Acti|on among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Their mo&s;t Venerable Saint was <HI>Zo|rou&s;ter,</HI> a famous A&s;trologer, who fir&s;t taught A&s;tronomy to the ancient <HI>Per|&s;ian Magi,</HI> and perhaps that 'tis from him that they learn'd to wor&s;hip the Sun. But the <HI>Gavres</HI> neverthele&s;s will tell
<PB N="189" REF="108">you, that they do not wor&s;hip this Planet, but only one God; but Hi&s;to|ries &s;ay the contrary; we know that <HI>Armenia</HI> has been honour'd with a great many Martyrs, that cho&s;e rather to die than adore the Sun. How to reconcile this with the <HI>Gavres</HI> Profe&s;|&s;ion, I cannot well tell; but I am apt to believe the&s;e People are a&s;ham'd to own their Idolatry.</P>
<P>Their Chief Fea&s;t is call'd <HI>Nau-Rous,</HI> that is, a <HI>New Day;</HI> for 'tis al|ways the Fir&s;t Day of the Year. They begin this Fea&s;t the very &s;ame minute the <HI>Sun</HI> enters into <HI>Aries;</HI> it la&s;ts Eight Days, all which they &s;pend in Dancing, Sports, and Jovialty, in Honour of the <HI>Sun.</HI> The modern <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> al&s;o retain this Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gavres</HI> &s;eem to me to differ le&s;s from the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> than the modern <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> for their Manners are much purer; they are brought up and nou|ri&s;h'd in the Bo&s;om of Poverty, and have a good Di&s;po&s;ition to the Go&s;pel if they could be but made more attentive.</P>
