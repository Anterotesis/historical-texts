<HEAD>Here Followeth An ACCOUNT Remarkable OF <HI>The Hand of GOD</HI> Upon &s;ome other PERSECUTORS In the &s;ame ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P>SOme Friends in this place having con&s;iderable Quan|tities of Negroes, who being naturally inclined to Loo&s;ne&s;s and Wickedne&s;s, in taking more Wives and Husbands than one (a Cu&s;tom in their own Country) and being very ignorant, and aver&s;e to that which is good; believed it their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to &s;et &s;ome time apart to labour with them, and to in&s;truct them in the things
<PB N="18" REF="10">of God: And in order thereunto, mo&s;t Friends that had Negroes &s;et apart one hour or two once a week to in|&s;truct them according to their under&s;tanding, and to read the Scriptures to them, directing them to the inward Teacher, whereby they might be led out of Stealing, Murdering, Plotting, and of their Uncleanne&s;s and Adul|tery. This Chri&s;tian Practice &s;o offended the then Autho|rity, that a Law was made, entituled, <HI>An Act to prevent the People call'd Quakers from bringing their Negroes to their Meetings,</HI> (though it was in their own Hou&s;es) the Pe|nalty being no le&s;s than the forfeiting of each Negroe that was found at a Meeting, or Ten pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> a piece for each Negroe.</P>
<P>Some Friends were &s;oon pro&s;ecuted by the &s;ame Law with great violence, and large expectations of the Inform|ers: One <HI>Thomas Cobham</HI> began, and brought an Action again&s;t <HI>Ralph Fretwell,</HI> for Eighty Negroes of his own at a Meeting in his own Family, for Eight hundred pound <HI>&s;terling;</HI> and al&s;o again&s;t <HI>Lewis Morris,</HI> for a very great Sum; the &s;aid <HI>Cobham</HI> being countenanced by one <HI>John Merrick,</HI> a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and an A&s;&s;i&s;tant of the Court where the Actions were to be tried; and after &s;eve|ral Courts, Judgment was given in favour of the Defen|dants, to the great Di&s;appointment of the Envious, e&s;pe|cially one <HI>Charles Collins</HI> a Lawyer, who u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Skill in behalf of the Informers. But the above&s;aid <HI>Thomas Cobham</HI> the Informer, who of a lu&s;ty likely young man, in a &s;mall time became dejected, being generally &s;lighted, and his company refu&s;ed by &s;everal for being an Informer; and &s;oon after was taken with a Fever and Swelling in his Neck and Throat, which daily increa&s;ed in a very &s;trange man|ner; &s;o that towards his latter End, he cried out, <HI>Fire, fire, he was all on fire;</HI> and &s;aid to his Mother, <HI>She need not provide a Coffin for him, for he &s;hould be burnt up before it was made;</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="10">crying out, <HI>Neither Heaven nor Hell, but all fire, fire;</HI> and cried &s;aying, <HI>Now the Quakers will &s;ay, It is a Judgment fal|len on me.</HI> After this manner did this mi&s;erable man end his Days.</P>
<P>Soon after died <HI>John Daw</HI> of a Surfeit by Drinking, who was an In&s;trument in this evil Work. Al&s;o,</P>
<P><HI>John Mackfa&s;hion,</HI> one of the Evidences, never thrived afterwards, but in a &s;mall time died of that deplorable Di&s;|ea&s;e called the Belly-ake.</P>
<P>And the afore&s;aid Ju&s;tice, <HI>John Merrick,</HI> riding to his own Hou&s;e in Drink, was thrown by his Hor&s;e, to the hurt|ing of his Brain, (though no outward appearance) who continued &s;ome few days in a violent raving condition, to the Terror of his Friends, and then died.</P>
<P><HI>William Sharp,</HI> an Eminent Man, and Judge of a Court, was a great Oppo&s;er of our Labour with the&s;e poor Ne|groes; who riding from his own Hou&s;e to the <HI>Bridge Town,</HI> (&s;eemingly very well) fell from his Hor&s;e before he got to the Town, and we cannot under&s;tand that he ever &s;pake afterwards (except <HI>O my Head</HI>) and in three or four Days afterwards died.</P>

<P>A Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and Judge of a Court, and one of the Council, and of the Nation of <HI>Scot|land:</HI> He appeared, without any ju&s;t Cau&s;e, very bitter and envious again&s;t us: He cau&s;ed a Friend to be rated 400 pounds of Sugar towards payment of the Prie&s;ts Wages, (who never wrought for him) the Prie&s;t being his Son in-Law; for which was taken from the &s;aid Friend a Cow worth Ten Pound <HI>&s;terling;</HI> and upon Complaint of the &s;aid Friend, and upon Enquiry, there was but ten pounds of Su|gar appeared to be their pretended Due: For the Poors
<PB N="20" REF="11">part, and for mending Highways, we duely pay; but this being the Prie&s;ts part, he could not for Con&s;cience pay; yet was this unju&s;t Action vindicated by the &s;aid <HI>Ruddock,</HI> not|with&s;tanding &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates that were at the hear|ing of the matter, would have had the Cow returned to the right Owner; but becau&s;e the &s;aid Friend had com|plained of the Wrong and Oppre&s;&s;ion, he the &s;aid <HI>Ruddock</HI> being Judge of the Quarter Se&s;&s;ions, cau&s;ed him to be fi|ned five pounds <HI>&s;terling,</HI> becau&s;e he could not take the Oath of a Con&s;table (which for Con&s;cience-&s;ake he only refu&s;ed) although he was willing to have performed the Office, ac|cording to his Ability and Under&s;tanding, if he might have been permitted without an Oath, which &s;everal Friends had been, by moderate Magi&s;trates, and found to perform the &s;ame hone&s;tly and diligently: For which Fine, the &s;aid <HI>Ruddock</HI> the Judge i&s;&s;ued out his Warrant again&s;t the &s;aid Friend to a Con&s;table, upon which was taken from him a Negroe Woman, which they had to the Con&s;tables Hou&s;e, where <HI>Ruddock</HI> was him&s;elf, and &s;o ordered the matter, that the &s;aid Negroe was valued but at two thou&s;and three hundred pounds of Sugar, which as the price of Sugar then went, might amount to 11 <HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> which Negroe was &s;old &s;ome time after for 26 <HI>l.</HI> and was all kept for the Fine of 5<HI>l.</HI> And the &s;aid Friend having &s;uffered above Seven thou&s;and pounds of Sugar in one year by his means, which the &s;aid Friend laid before him in the pre&s;ence of his Daughter, the Prie&s;ts Wife, telling him he had &s;uffered all that for com|plaining of the Wrong he had done him about his Cow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at which he &s;eemed greatly to rejoyce, and &s;aid it &s;hould be &s;o yearly, &s;o long as he was Magi&s;trate: But he did not live a year after.

<PB N="21" REF="11">broke up, which was late, for the Order to break up our Meeting in his Precincts, and promi&s;ed the Governour di|ligently to obey all his Commands: But calling at Judge <HI>Rees,</HI> in his way home, was taken ill; but went home, and calling for a Medicine called <HI>Cream of Tartar,</HI> which he u&s;ed to take in his Broth, by his own mi&s;take took <HI>Ar&s;e|nick</HI> in&s;tead thereof, and &s;o wretchedly ended his Days; which may be a Warning to others.</P>
<P>He threatned that with the Money taken from us, there &s;hould be a Pri&s;on built for us: He would not let us eat fre&s;h Meat, and went to take away the Meat which a Friend bought in the Market, &s;aying he would have it, although the Butcher told him &s;everal times that he had &s;old it, and was receiving the Money fot it.</P>
<P>Another Friend having bought Meat in the Market, and the Butcher carrying it to his Hou&s;e, was met in the way by the &s;aid <HI>Ruddock,</HI> who commanded him to carry it back into the Market, &s;aying, <HI>They &s;hall not eat fre&s;h Meat;</HI> the man turned back, and dur&s;t not carry the Friend his Meat which he had bought of him.
