<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to find by yours, that in <HI>En|gland</HI> you have no very good Opinion of us here, in this critical Juncture; but allow me to tell you, that though you have more Strength than we, we &s;eem at lea&s;t to have as great Zeal. I &s;hall give you on|ly the bare Matter of Fact. The Chancellor having an Expre&s;s from Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> our Se|cretary at <HI>London,</HI> called the Council, and imparted to them Her Maje&s;ties Plea&s;ure, for putting the Kingdom in a po&s;ture of Defence, that we might not be &s;urprized in ca&s;e our Enemies from abroad &s;hould make any at|tempt upon our Coa&s;t, or in our Neighbour|hood, as it &s;eems they intended; upon which the Council, in two or three meetings, did what belong'd to them to do, in the following particulars.</P>
<P>The Commander in chief of the Forces had immediately Orders to po&s;t them &s;o, as that they could conveniently and &s;peedily meet upon occa&s;ion; and in order to this, a Thou|&s;and Hor&s;e and Dragoons are to lye at <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> or not far from it.</P>
<P>The Governors and Commanders of Ca|&s;tles and Forts were &s;ent for, and Enquiry made what Stores and Provi&s;ions they had in them, and Orders given to furni&s;h them with Provi&s;ions for &s;ix Months, and with all nece&s;|&s;ary Ammunition; for which end &s;uch quan|tities of Powder and other Ammunition as were to be had here, were order'd to be bought, and Orders were &s;ent over the King|dom to the other Towns, for &s;ending to the Council an account of what Powder or other Ammunition was any where to be found: And in the mean while, the Magi&s;trates of the place were order'd to take care, that none of it be &s;old without their Authority.</P>
<P>Upon &s;ome Information which the Council receiv'd, particular care hath been taken of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by removing all &s;u&s;pected and unnece&s;&s;ary People out of it, and by put|ting one of the inferiour Officers under an Ar|re&s;t. Upon information that many di&s;affected People were come to Town, and &s;ome lately from abroad, the Gates of the Town were &s;hut, and a general Search was made, and &s;ome few apprehended; but for the greater &s;ecre|cy in time coming, the Council &s;igned a War|rant to the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> to &s;eize on the Arms and Hor&s;es of per&s;ons whom he &s;hould judge di&s;|affected, and &s;uch per&s;ons them&s;elves, whom he &s;hould keep in Cu&s;tody till they were pre|&s;ented by him to the Council at its next mee|ting. The Magi&s;trates of this City were cal|led for, and the care of the &s;ame recommen|ded to them, particularly, to double their Guards, and to have the Names of all tho&s;e that come hither every night, and that are not Inhabitants, to be brought to them; and that the Magi&s;trates con&s;ider tho&s;e Names, and de|liver to the Chancellor at lea&s;t once every week Li&s;ts of &s;uch of them as are &s;u&s;pected or unknown. The Council hath likewi&s;e orde|red, That Fencible-men, and Heretors, (that is, as you call 'em, the Gentry and riche&s;t &s;ort of Freeholders) all over the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> to be in a readine&s;s with their Hor&s;es and Arms to meet under their &s;everal Commanders upon Adverti&s;ement given them, either by particular Order, or by the &s;ignal of Fires upon Beacons, which are order'd to be kindled upon the fir&s;t appearance of a Fleet on the Coa&s;t. Letters are al&s;o &s;ent to all the Members of Council, requiring them to attend; and the Council or Committees of Council are to &s;it every day during the pre&s;ent Alarms.</P>
<P>The Council being inform'd, that &s;ome di&s;|affected Church-men prayed either for the late Government, or not for this, or in &s;uch ambi|guous words, that their meaning was clear enough to be under&s;tood they meant the late King, ordered the Proclamation which I &s;end you inclo&s;ed to be publi&s;h'd. The Council had publi&s;h'd the other Proclamation, which I al&s;o &s;end you, &s;ome time before; but I &s;end it to &s;hew you, that the generality of our Church-men are well inclin'd.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, whatever Zeal you in <HI>England</HI> may have inwardly, we do hitherto at lea&s;t &s;hew as much.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are <HI>Di&s;contents</HI> and <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> among us, but the &s;ubject of them is either the le&s;&s;er concerns of what generally we take to be Religion, and for which &s;ometimes <HI>we</HI> may in|deed <HI>con&s;iderately</HI> enough <HI>venture,</HI> but &s;ure, will ne'r in a plain ca&s;e throw away the greater; or it is Remains of Animo&s;ities from the memory of the Violences of the late Reigns; but to en|deavour to bring back tho&s;e Reigns, were an odd way of re&s;enting &s;uch Violences, and which one would think no man in the&s;e King|doms, that has either Sen&s;e or Hone&s;ty, &s;hould be guilty of. I am</P>

<SALUTE>To Macers of Our Privy Council, Me&s;&s;engers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly, and &s;everally, &s;pecially con&s;titute Greeting:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Fora&s;much, as albeit, by the Act of the Meeting of E&s;tates of this our Antient Kingdom, Dated the 13th day of <HI>April, 1689,</HI> Our Leidges were Certified, not to own or acknowledge the late K. <HI>James</HI> the Second for their King, but that they, and every one of them, &s;hould render their dutiful Obedience to Us; and in particular, that all the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel within this Kingdom &s;hould publickly Pray for Us, as King and Queen of this Realm, under the Pains and Certifications &s;pecified in the &s;aid Act: As al&s;o, We with Advice of Our E&s;tates of Parli|ament, by Our Act of 22th of <HI>July, 1690.</HI> Or|dained the &s;aid Act and Proclamation of the E&s;tates of this our Kingdom, to be put to further Executi|on, again&s;t all &s;uch Mini&s;ters who had not given O|bedience thereto, by praying for Us, in manner men|tioned in the &s;aid Act: And that the Lords of Our Privy Council &s;hould proceed therein, or im|power other Magi&s;trates to do the &s;ame within their re&s;pective bounds, as they &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e. Yet neverthele&s;s, the &s;aid Acts have been &s;o far from receiving the punctual and exact Obedience due to them, That many Preachers have either pre&s;umed wholly to neglect Praying for Us, as King and Queen of this Realm, conform to the &s;aids Acts, or at lea&s;t have &s;o far te&s;tified a want of Ingenuity and Plainne&s;s required in a Duty of this Nature, that they make u&s;e of &s;uch ambiguous and unclear Ex|pre&s;&s;ions in their Prayers, that the hearers cannot di&s;tinctly know they Pray for Us, to the Great Di|&s;paragement of the &s;aids Laws, and contempt of Our Authority. Therefore We, with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, do &s;trictly require and Command the Sheriff of the &s;everal Shires, Bai|lies of Regalities, Stewarts of Stewarties, and Magi&s;trats of the Burghs Royal of this Kingdom within their Bounds and Juri&s;dictions re&s;pective, to make due and exact tryal what Mini&s;ters Preach|ing in Churches or Meeting-Hou&s;es, within their re|&s;pective bounds, Pray not ordinarly for Us, in &s;uch circum&s;tantiat Terms, as their Hearers may di&s;tinct|ly know that they Pray for Us, as King and Queen of this Realm; and for that effect, We with the Advice fore&s;aid, Hereby Require and Impower the &s;everal Magi&s;trats re&s;pective fore&s;aids, to conveen and call before them &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hall think fit, to give Information and Evidence again&s;t &s;uch Mini&s;ters Preaching in Churches or Meeting-Hou&s;es, who fail in their Obedience to the Acts above-men|tioned, in manner above &s;et down, and that the &s;aids Magi&s;trats re&s;pective, Tran&s;mit under their Hands, to the Clerks of Our Privy Council, betwixt and the fir&s;t day of <HI>June</HI> next to come, (for &s;uch as are on this &s;ide of the Water of <HI>Tay,</HI> and the fifteenth day of the &s;aid Month, for the&s;e on the other &s;ide thereof,) the Names of the &s;everal Mini&s;ters offend|ing in the Premi&s;&s;es, with the place of their re&s;i|dence, and the original Information and Evidence they have received and taken again&s;t them, to the Effect they may be Pro&s;ecute with all Rigor, and the Penalties and Certifications in the &s;aids Laws con|tained, ju&s;tly Inflicted and Executed again&s;t them. With Certification to the &s;aids re&s;pective Magi&s;trats who fail herein, they &s;hall be repute as Connivers at, and Abettors of the &s;aids Offenders, and negligent in the Execution and performance of their Offices and Duty committed to them, and pro&s;ecute as &s;uch accor|dingly.
