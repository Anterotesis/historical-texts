<HEAD>A WICKED PLOT AGAINST The Per&s;on of Sir WILLIAM WALLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Doubt not but you have heard of our Siedge at Arun|dell Ca&s;tle, but in regard I am not ignorant how un|certain reports of this nature are at London, I am bold to pre&s;ent you with a brief (yet true Relation) both of the whole Siedge, and the yeilding up of the &s;aid Ca&s;tle to Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> on Twelfe-day la&s;t in the morning.</P>
<P>At our fir&s;t &s;itting down before the Town and Ca&s;tle of Arundell, the Cavaliers &s;hewed them&s;elves very bold and in&s;olent, &amp; &s;eemed to be &s;o confident of their own &s;trength that they took the offer of quarter in defiance, &amp; hung out their red flag, but within halfe an houres fight the enemy was forced from their Out-workes, and above eighty of them taken pri&s;oners, the re&s;t we pur&s;ued into the Town, who without any further oppo&s;ition fled into the Ca&s;tle for &s;helter, and the &s;treets were quickly &s;coured by our Forlorn Hope, and one Captain and a Lieutenant with ma|ny other pri&s;oners taken.</P>
<P>The Town being thus cleered of the Enemy and wonne by our men, the Cavaliers played out of the Ca&s;tle with
<PB REF="3" MS="y">musket &s;hot, but could command but very little of the Town; for the greate&s;t annoyance they did us by &s;hoot|ing from thence, was on the Bridge, where one of our men was &s;hot in the thigh, and Captain <HI>Butler</HI> &s;capt ve|ry narrowly, for he was &s;hot thorow the Hol&s;ter as he rode over.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God that we lo&s;t not above three or foure men (to my be&s;t knowledge) in entering the Town, be|&s;ides &s;ome few that were wounded, of which number I mu&s;t with &s;orrow remember that valiant Gentleman Lieutenant Collonell <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> who was killled, and Lieu|tenant Collonell <HI>Burcher,</HI> who received a wound in the belly, but is pretty well recovered of it againe, and our chiefe Engineer was taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>In the taking of this Towne (which is by nature &s;citu|ate in a place of great advantage, and was fortified by the Enemy) I may not forget the undanted courage of our men, and e&s;pecially the blew coats, who run up the Ene|mies workes, and beat them off with the but ends of their muskets: and indeed, to &s;peak the truth, tho&s;e men which we took at <HI>Alton</HI> that ioyned with us, did very good &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>Yet in this place I cannot omit to acquaint you of a perfidious ra&s;call, that for hire or &s;ome other wicked end, would have killed our Noble Generall, and not certainly knowing his per&s;on, gave fire at the Sergeant Maior Ge|nerall; but it plea&s;ed God that his Musket went not off, &s;o that his wicked de&s;igne was prevented, and him&s;elfe de|&s;ervedly hanged.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of our foot were quartered in the town and a Regiment of Hor&s;e kept a guard, that not onely all manner of reliefe might be kept from the Ca&s;tle, but
<PB REF="3" MS="y">al&s;o to prevent their &s;allying forth, which within three dayes they attempted to do, but were quickly driven in a|gain with lo&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>And after that they turned forth of the Ca&s;tle about a hundred hor&s;e into a Medow, part of which was within Musket &s;hot of the Ca&s;tle, and yet mo&s;t of them were quickly gotten out by our men.</P>
<P>Some of their men being hunger-bitten, got over the Walles and &s;lid downe with Ropes and were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>One <HI>Richard Smith</HI> e&s;caped about foure miles out of Towne, that came out of the Ca&s;tle, and was taken at one of our Courts of Guard, where being by the Cap|taine of the Guard very &s;trictly examined, he confe&s;&s;ed, that he was &s;ent with a Letter to Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> for ayde, but would not produce the Letter, but &s;aid that he had lo&s;t it: So that it appearing that he had beene an arch Spie in our Army, and was now going to be|tray it into the hands of the Enemy, he was condem|ned to be hanged upon the Bridge in the view of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>But we were much troubled, and did greatly feare le&s;t that &s;ome of the chiefe of their Commanders had e&s;ca|ped out of the Ca&s;tle, for the la&s;t Week was found (by &s;ome of our &s;oldiers) upon the River which run|neth near to the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, a Boate made of Hor&s;e Hides, which was brought from the Ca&s;tle, and it is a great pre&s;umption, that &s;ome u&s;e was made thereof; but it is rather thought that it conveyed &s;ome Me&s;&s;enger away to Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> then that any Com|manders e&s;caped.</P>
<PB REF="4" MS="y">
<P> Much talke we had of <HI>Hoptons</HI> comming, for divers dayes together, and &s;ome of our Scouts did affirme that they &s;aw &s;ome of his Scouts and were near his body, but we heard no more of him untill VVedne&s;day la&s;t, at which time news was brought that he had be&s;ieged VVaberton Hou&s;e about &s;ixe miles from Chiche&s;ter, in which is a Garri&s;on of about eighty men under the Command of Collonel <HI>Norton.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon Friday la&s;t a Drummer came forth of the Ca&s;tle for a parley, but &s;eeing great &s;tore of Provi&s;ion in our Army, and having been hunger-bitten in the Ca&s;tle, he yeilded him&s;elf pri&s;oner rather then to carry an an&s;wer back into the Ca&s;tle, &s;o that they were con&s;trained to &s;end another, and a Parley was granted, but in regard they would not accept of Sir <HI>Williams</HI> free proffer of quarter at his fir&s;t comming, he now utterly refu&s;ed to give them any, but would have them &s;ubmit to his mercy. The Lady <HI>Bi|&s;hop</HI> and many other Gentle women of quality came out of the Ca&s;tle: And the next morning being on Twelfe day la&s;t, the Ca&s;tle was &s;urrendred upon quarter, but all of them were to become pri&s;oners; of which there was about eight hundred Common &s;oldiers, and about a hun|dred and fifty Commanders, of which the chiefe&s;t were Sir <HI>Edward Bi&s;hop,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Ford,</HI> Collonell <HI>Banfield,</HI> Lieutenant Collonell <HI>Rolles,</HI> Major <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> and Major <HI>Mullins,</HI> who are all very &s;uddainly to be &s;ent up to the City of London.</P>
<P>It was my chance to be at Arundell at the very in&s;tant when the Ca&s;tle was yeilded, and &s;aw the Pri&s;oners march out, but I never &s;aw &s;o many weake and feeble creatures together in my life, for almo&s;t all the Common &s;ouldiers
<PB REF="4" MS="y">were halfe &s;tarved, and many of them hardly able to &s;et one foot before another. Yet had they Beefe very plenti|full, but they certified us, that they had no bread &s;ince Chri&s;tmas day. There were great &s;tore of Hor&s;e, armes, and much trea&s;ure found in the Ca&s;tle: So that it is not a little weakening to the Enemy, and &s;trengthening to our Partie.</P>
<P>The taking of this place hath wonderfully encouraged our men, who are all &s;o forward in their &s;ervice that they de&s;erve great commendations, and the Lord I hope will pro&s;per all their undertakings.</P>
<P>VVithin a day or two after the taking of the &s;aid Ca|&s;tle, there fell out a fortunate adventure, no le&s;&s;e remar|kable then all the re&s;t. A man of VVarre of Holland had cha&s;ed a Dunkirk Ship laden with good &s;tore of Merchan|dize and linnen Cloth, which is now very welcome to our Army.</P>
<P>She had in her twenty four pieces of Bra&s;&s;e Ordnance, about a hundred Barrels of Powder, good &s;tore of Armes, which (according to the Ordinary cu&s;tome of Imagina|tion in this kinde) was conceived and believed to be &s;ent to the relief of the Engli&s;h-Iri&s;h, that make havocke now in Che&s;hire.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> Boarded the Ship, which came up the Channell not farre from Arundell Ca&s;tle, on Tue&s;day la&s;t, and is now Ma&s;ter of it.</P>
<P>He hath al&s;o &s;ent two thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, with two Drakes, to be&s;iedge the Lord <HI>Lumleys</HI> hou&s;e in Su&s;|&s;ex, the taking of which will be of great advantage to us, and it is thought, by the mo&s;t juditious Commanders, that it cannot long hold out.</P>
<PB REF="5" MS="y">
<P> This being done our Noble Generall, as we heare, intends to lo&s;e no time, but having received the additions of the London Trained Bands into his Army, he intend|eth to march VVe&s;twards, from whence we under&s;tand there are con&s;iderable &s;upplyes comming to the relief of Sir <HI>Ralph Hoptan:</HI> And it is hoped that Redding, VVal|lingford, and &s;ome other Townes thereabouts will &s;oon be brought to &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>VVhich I pray to the Lord they may in his due time, to his glory; and that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;end a period to the&s;e troubles. VVhich is the continuall prayer of him who is</P>
