</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I <HI>Annuary</HI> the fir&s;t 1649. We embarqued from <HI>Wexford</HI> in the <HI>Hector</HI> for <HI>Corke,</HI> &s;ayled two or three leagues beyond <HI>Greenor-bay,</HI> but were driven back, the wind turning upon us, upon the Saturday following the wind being fair we got within &s;ight of <HI>Dungarvan,</HI> that night proved very windy, and about four in the morning, on the Lords day, a very tempe&s;tu|ous wind aro&s;e, and the &s;torm was the great|e&s;t that ever any of the Sea-men knew (as they &s;aid) the wind was at South-ea&s;t very thick, we hoped to fetch <HI>Corke,</HI> being within a mile of the &s;hore, but could not po&s;&s;ibly make land: in that di&s;tre&s;s we put to &s;ea, hoping by that way to &s;ave life, the wind continued all that Sabbath day at South-ea&s;t, South-ea&s;t and by South, and South South-ea&s;t, which if the wind had held at &s;outh-ea&s;t as it was in the morning, we could not have doubled the point about the land but had been ea&s;t upon the rocks: we bore two cour&s;es to keep off from the &s;hore all the day, and being as we &s;uppo&s;ed about the pitch of the Cape Cleere, at nine on Sabbath day night we &s;hipt a great Sea which &s;plit and carryed away our fore&s;aile, and &s;o were forced to bring to a fore-top fail to keep from the &s;hore, and to here that fore tope-&s;aile till two in the night, in which time we were formed to cut our Anchor from the bough to &s;ave the &s;hip from foundring, we having at that time five foot water in the hold. The Monday morning we were ten leagues to leeward of the Cape Cleere, and the
<PB N="4" REF="4">wind was up at South-we&s;t, then we made all the &s;ayl po&s;&s;ible to fetch &s;ome harbour, and it plea&s;ed God, we made the Cape, hoping to fetch <HI>Baltamore,</HI> but the wind coming up at South-ea&s;t and by ea&s;t, we were forced to Sea again all the night, the wind continuing at South-ea&s;t, South-ea&s;t and by South, and South-South-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day we made the Mi&s;ne head, and could fetch no harbour the wind being &s;till at South-ea&s;t. Wedne&s;day the wind came up at We&s;t, and we made for &s;hore again, and came up as high as <HI>Gally-head</HI> hoping to fetch <HI>Kin&s;ale;</HI> about three in the after-noone the wind came up at Ea&s;t South-ea&s;t, and then we hoped to recover <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven</HI> before night, and made for it, and in our running in, the Wind veared at South-ea&s;t and blew very fre&s;h, and we &s;till hoping to gain the harbour, ranin, knowing no other way to &s;ave life, the Wind being &s;o contrary, it grew extraordinary thick, rained and blew much, we fired three or four pieces of Ordnance (for lights) and &s;aw one light from the Ca&s;tle, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, and two other lights to the Ea&s;t|ward, which put us to an amazement, not knowing whether they were friends or enemies, and could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee the going into the Harbour, but were in the very breach of the &s;hore, the &s;ight where|of cau&s;ed a great &s;crik in the Ship, and thereupon brought our Ship to, hoping thereby to have come to an Anchor, which if we had done, we had been pa&s;t all hopes of life, the Rock being &s;o neer would have cut our Anchor, but God being mo&s;t merciful in that nick of time, the Sea-men de&s;pairing of life, the Wind at an in&s;tant came up at Ea&s;t, which carryed us into the Sea, and yet &s;o great was the danger, that if the Wind did not turn again to the We&s;t in le&s;s than half an hour, we were dead men, by rea&s;on of the Rocks called the <HI>Staggs,</HI> &s;o we came in a little time within &s;ight of the Rocks, the Wind driving us &s;trongly upon them, and then &s;eeing the Rocks within a Ships length of us, we put our Ship to &s;tay, which &s;he would not, the Sea being &s;o extremely grown, the Sea-men being at their wits end, wi&s;hing us to prepare for death: the Lord again at that very in&s;tent cau&s;ed the wind to come up at South-we&s;t, which carryed us out into the Sea cleer from the Rocks, where we had the Wind favourable that night, and ble&s;&s;ed be God on Thur&s;day we came into <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> it being the fir&s;t Harbour that the Lord was plea&s;ed to give us, but that which is mo&s;t admirable is this, that &s;o &s;oon as the Ship was come into <HI>Kin&s;ale</HI> Har|bour, &s;he leaked &s;o very much, that the Sea-men came the next morn|ing and told us, that they were almo&s;t drowned that night, and could
<PB N="5" REF="4">&s;carce keep the &s;hip alive in the Harbour, and were forced the next tide to bring her to the Key, and at the Ebb to repair her, and had much ado to keep her from &s;inking. This being the method of Gods dealing with us in our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Now concerning the work of God upon my &s;pirit during the &s;torm, thus it was. Towards the evening of the Sabbath day <HI>Jannuary</HI> the 5. my heart was exceeding &s;ad and &s;orrowfull even unto death a dark night approaching, and the &s;hip taking in much water, my &s;pirit fainted and my heart &s;unk within me, the &s;orrows of death caught hould of me, much grieved I was for my poor dear heart who did not expre&s;s half &s;o much fear as my &s;elf, many &s;weet expre&s;&s;ions &s;he u&s;ed in prayers, wi&s;hing me to call earne&s;tly upon God: many words I could not u&s;e, but my heart was praying; it almo&s;t broke my heart to think what my wives friends would &s;ay in <HI>England,</HI> that I &s;hould bring her into <HI>Ireland</HI> to drown her (though I ble&s;s God &s;he never repined at it) troubled I was likewi&s;e for my poor &s;ervants that came in love along with us; it almo&s;t &s;plit my heart to think what the Malignants would &s;ay in <HI>England</HI> when they hear that we were drowned (how they would abu&s;e that pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 28.4.) That though vengeance hath not overtaken me at Land, yet I was met withal at Sea; much troubled I was at the manner of the death, &s;uch extraordinary violent deaths importing the na|ture of &s;ome heavy Judgement, as if the Lord hath been di&s;plea&s;ed with us, and had not &s;ent us, and <HI>Jonahs</HI> &s;torm was much in my thoughts (I having &s;poken &s;ome words of Exhortation to the com|pany out of that Scripture before the &s;torm began) for God &s;ent that great &s;torm, <HI>Jonah.</HI> 1.4. becau&s;e <HI>Jonah</HI> went contrary to his Commands, where I ob&s;erved, That when a Chri&s;tian is in Gods way, upon Gods errand &s;ent to Sea, u&s;ually God makes the Winde and the Seas fa|vourable to him; upon &s;uch con&s;iderations, and many obiections made by fle&s;h and blood, I had very much trouble with my unbelieving heart, and could not bring my mind to be willing to die, earne&s;t I had been in &s;ecret prayer at the Throne of Grace before, for 16. or 18. hours to|gether, pleading with the Lord, that if it were po&s;&s;ible this cup of his indignation might pa&s;e over us, that in Judgments he would remem|ber Mercy, however that we might cheerfully &s;ubmit to his &s;weet plea&s;ure; the materials of my long &s;ugge&s;ted prayers were meditations and applications of &s;everal Scriptures which mention Gods power,
<PB N="6" REF="5">wi&s;dome and love in the Seas. God having put it into my minde not long before to note mo&s;t of the chief places is Scripture con|cerning the Seas, as proper and u&s;efull for a Sea-voyage. I pre&s;t my dear Chri&s;t not to drown us, for &s;aid I, we fight for thy King|ly Office, throw the <HI>Agyptians</HI> and all thy emplacable enemies into the mid&s;t of the Sea, but let us be pre&s;erved that we may prai&s;e thy Name, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.27, 30. <HI>&amp;</HI> 15.1. Lord this is a calamity too heavy for thy poor creatures to beare. <HI>Job</HI> 6.3 were it not that thou ha&s;t ca&s;t our &s;ins into the depths of the Seas: <HI>Micah</HI> 7.19. Lord &s;uffer not the deeps to &s;wallow us up: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 69.15. Let not all thy waves and billowes pa&s;s over us. We have &s;een thy wonders in the deep: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107.23. And if thou &s;ave us we &s;hall declare them to the children of men; but if thou make our graves in the Sea, the dead cannot prai&s;e thee: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 115.17. thou Lord which leade&s;t thy Servants through the deep, prepare dry Land for us: Lord, why &s;hould not the Seas be as favourable to thy &s;ervants as the dry Land? Thou laye&s;t up the depth in &s;tore-hou&s;es, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 33.7. Thou Lord can&s;t &s;till the noy&s;e of the waves, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 65, 7. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 68.22. was a comfortable place to me, that the Lord promi&s;ed to bring again his people from the depth of the Sea. Sweet Chri&s;t do thy Office and be a Savour to thy people both for Souls and Bodies, thou laye&s;t the beames of thy Chambers in the waters 10.4. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 3. and rule&s;t the raging of the Seas. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.9. Now Lord the floods have lifted up their voyce and their waves: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 93.2. but thou art mightyer than the mighty waves of the Sea. The fi&s;hes of the Sea &s;hall &s;hrink at thy pre&s;ence: but why art thou &s;o angry with thy &s;ervants who art &s;ent in thy &s;ervice? Lord ca&s;t the great Dragon into the Bottomle&s;s Pit, that old Ser|pent called the Devil and Sathan. <HI>Revel.</HI> 12.9. but let thy people live to prai&s;e thee; thou Lord can&s;t &s;ay to the Sea, Be dry: <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 44.27. <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 50.2, and can&s;t ea&s;ily bring us &s;afe to land Lord ha&s;t not thou made the depths of the Sea a way for thy ran&s;omed ones to pa&s;s over? <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 51.10. Why mu&s;t then thy &s;ervants be drowned as if they were in this Malefactors? <HI>Ionah</HI> ran away from thee and would not obey thee, being unwilling to be the mouth and proclaimer of thy Iu&s;tice upon <HI>Nineveh</HI> the head of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Empire; and thou &s;ente&s;t out a great winde, and there was a mighty tempe&s;t in the Sea, <HI>Ionah.</HI> 4. which was no ordinary wind, but &s;ent as a puni&s;hment for his di&s;obedience, yet becau&s;e he was thy &s;ervant, and was not &s;elvi&s;h,
<PB N="7" REF="5">nor di&s;plea&s;ed in thy &s;hewing mercy for fear of his being thought a fal&s;e Prophet, but out of zeal for thy glory which he thought was wronged and ob&s;cured by that change, and out of his ardent affecti|on to thy people that their enemies &s;hould live; and though he &s;aid, he did well to be angry, even unto death, they being not words of expre&s;&s;e rebellion, but of a pa&s;&s;ionate Spirit blinded with anger, therefore when he prayed unto thee out of the belly of Hell, he was mightily pre&s;erved. Now Lord, thou which wa&s;t a God &s;o gracious and merciful &s;low to anger, &amp; of great kindne&s;s towards the Heathens in <HI>Niveveh</HI> &s;hall not we find thy mercy? if thou ha&s;t any further work for us to do in our generation, we &s;hall. Lord, it is the wicked that is like the troubled Sea, who&s;e water ca&s;ts up mire and dirt, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.20 Thy Ju&s;tice was very wonderful and glorious at <HI>Wexford,</HI> in drown|ing tho&s;e Pirates and wicked men in the Sea, that had done &s;o much mi&s;chief to thy people in that Element, and what will thy enemies &s;ay when the carka&s;&s;es of thy people are given to be food for the Fi&s;hes? Lord command this great wind into thy trea&s;ure, and bring forth winds &s;erviceable for us that we may have an au&s;picious gale, and an expeditious fail into &s;ome Harbour where it &s;hall plea&s;e thy Maje&s;ty, for thy poor creatures are at their wits end, and death appears in their faces; thou only can&s;t &s;hut up the Sea with doors, <HI>Job.</HI> 38.8. Thou make&s;t the deep to boyle like a pot, and make&s;t the Sea like a pot of oyntment, as if the Sea was hoary by the long white frothy path, <HI>Job.</HI> 41.31, 32. Sweet Chri&s;t, thou ha&s;t dominion from Sea to Sea, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 72.8. and thou ha&s;t given to the Sea a decree, that the waters pa&s;s not thy commands, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.29. Therefore though the Sea Roar and threaten to &s;wallow us up, yet unle&s;s thou give&s;t it a commi&s;&s;ion to devour us, it cannot hurt us: &s;weet Chri&s;t, the Sea is unto thee as the dry land, the winds and Seas will obey thee, dear Redeemer wilt not thou &s;peak one word to &s;ave the lives of thy own members? <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.26, 27. <HI>and</HI> 14.27. <HI>Mark</HI> 4.29. Peace, Be &s;till, will make a great calm. Lord a&s;&s;ure &s;ome of thy poor Servants that all &s;hall be well, as thou did&s;t to ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 27.23. Give &s;ome vi&s;ion and manife&s;tation of thy love, for it was for thy &s;ake that we committed our &s;elves to the Sea, let &s;ome of thy Servants in the Ship be a&s;&s;ured from Heaven that we &s;hall be &s;afe, however Lord let thy will be our wills: with other Scriptures, not now perfectly remembred. Now after long Prayers and medita|tions,
<PB N="8" REF="6">it plea&s;ed God about &s;ix on the Sabbath day night, that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t began to quiet my Spirit in him&s;elf, and I was well per&s;waded to die, and began to be ravi&s;ht with the Con&s;ideration of the joyes of Heaven, how quickly I and my poor heart &s;hould be in our Ma&s;ters joyes, that expre&s;&s;ion of entring into my Ma&s;ters joy af|fected me much, that the joy was too big to enter into me, I mu&s;t be &s;wallowed up in it, and that my Ma&s;ters joy could be no &s;mall joy; thereupon I &s;pake comfortably to my wife, de&s;iring her to cheer up, for that we &s;hould &s;uddainly be in Heaven, if the Lord was plea&s;ed thus to take us to him&s;elf, who re&s;igned her Soul to God, and we took our leaves &s;olemnly of each other, with our eyes full of teares, which I felt running down her cheeks when I ki&s;t them, &s;aying that all tears &s;hall &s;uddenly be wiped from our eyes in Heaven, and with a great fervour of Spirit I thought &s;everal times to this purpo&s;e, Sweet Je|&s;us I come to thee, we come not only in this Sea of waters, but Lord we come to thee in a Sea of blood if it &s;hall plea&s;e thee to call us, the &s;torm &s;till increa&s;ed, and I grew exceeding heavy and &s;leepy, but rou&s;ed my &s;elf up, and checked my heart, that I &s;hould <HI>Jonah</HI> like offer to &s;leep in &s;uch a &s;torm: what, be drowned in my &s;leep! my wife often beg|ged at me not to &s;leep, but I could not po&s;&s;ibly forbear &s;leep, if it had been to have &s;aved all our lives; &s;o it plea&s;ed God, that &s;itting as up|right as I could, I fell into as fa&s;t a &s;leep as ever I was in all my life.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<HEAD>And in my &s;leep I dreamed.</HEAD>
<P>THat I was in an upper chamber with my &s;weet Redeemer Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and that there were ma|ny Suiters attended to &s;peak with him, to be|&s;eech him to &s;ave their Ships and Barks, that they might not peri&s;h by the &s;torm. I thought it was a large room, wherein there was a long table with an ordinary Carpet, and two candles &s;tanding upon it, two trenchers of To|bacco, and Pipes, and one Man walking up and down by the ta|ble, of a middle &s;tature, about thirty years of age, the hairs of his Head long and white as flax, but curling at the end, but the hair of his upper lip brown, in &s;ad colour'd cloathes, and a cloth broad brim'd hat; I asked him who he was, who &s;aid, he waited upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I asked him where Je&s;us Chri&s;t was, he pointed to a Curtain, &s;aying, there he is; I beheld and &s;aw a glorious &s;hi|ning, but no per&s;on, and methought Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;pake to me, and asked me what I would have, I &s;aid the lives of all in the Ship; &s;aid he, in what &s;hip? &s;aid I in the <HI>Hector.</HI> It is a bad name &s;aid he, for &s;uch as profe&s;s me. <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux</HI> is for <HI>Heathens.</HI> I pray'd him that we might not dye in this manner; &s;ayes he to me, are not you &s;afe? but good Lord &s;aid I, I mu&s;t return, and I beg life for all in the Ship; who are they &s;aid he? I an&s;wered, that there was my dear Wife and three &s;ervants, Lieutenant Colo|nel <HI>Saunders,</HI> Major <HI>Bee,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hews,</HI> hone&s;t <HI>Abraham,</HI> and other pa&s;&s;engers thy &s;ervants, (&s;aid Je&s;us Chri&s;t at my naming Lieu. Col. <HI>Saunders</HI> and &s;ome others, its &s;o much the better that they are there) the Captain and the Sea-men are &s;erviceable to thy Cau&s;e, and they take wonderful pains to &s;ave their own lives and ours, but unle&s;s thou &s;peak the word, the Sea will &s;wallow us up. Then methought Je&s;us Chri&s;t askt me why I was not willing to dye? I told him, that by this death I could not glori|fie him, thinking upon that Scripture, <HI>Joh.</HI> 21.19. and methought I was &s;omething impatient that the Lord &s;hould &s;urprize us, get|ting us into a &s;hip at his call for his &s;ervice, and then to drown us, as if we were Parricides or hainous Malefactors, which by
<PB N="10" REF="7">Law were drowned: at that methought Je&s;us Chri&s;t withdrew, as if he was di&s;plea&s;ed; &s;aid I, Lord, if thou drowne&s;t tho&s;e that love thee, what wilt thou do to thine enemies? but could get no an&s;wer, whereupon I was &s;en&s;ible of my impatience, and thought that I fell down flat down on the ground, and cryed for mercy, &s;aying, Lord, we ki&s;s thy Rod, and turn our naked backs; &s;trike as much as thou plea&s;e&s;t. Lord, I plead nothing but thy free grace; it may be many of us have offended in exce&s;&s;ive drinking, and now thou art puni&s;hing us in our own Element; however our &s;ins are more then the &s;ands of the Sea-&s;hore, but let pitty move thee to &s;ave us; thou &s;weet Redeemer which ha&s;t been at Sea in &s;torms, that art a merciful High Prie&s;t, like unto us in all things but &s;in, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.17. and 4.15. take pitty upon thine own fle&s;h and blood; what Father but would &s;ave his Child from drowning if he could? ha&s;t thou no work for any of us to do? I thought the an&s;wer was, but little to be done by &s;ome of us; (my Wife tells me, that but a little before I &s;lept, I &s;aid, cer|tainly God had &s;omething for me, and others to do for his &s;er|vice, and therefore we &s;hould not dye at this time, which I did not remember;) &s;weet Chri&s;t hear us as thou did&s;t thy Di&s;ciples, &s;ave us quickly or el&s;e we peri&s;h; and being earne&s;t in prayer, in my dream methought that the man in the room came to me, and told me that this was no natural &s;torm of Gods &s;ending, but an extraordinary tempe&s;t rai&s;ed by Satan (by Gods permi&s;&s;ion) to de&s;troy tho&s;e which were coming to fight again&s;t his &s;ervants, and bad me u&s;e that argument to his Ma&s;ter. Thereupon I in|&s;tantly craved leave to &s;peak, and &s;aid, Sweet Saviour, if this &s;torm and tempe&s;t be rai&s;ed by Satan the Prince of the air, as in <HI>Lapland,</HI> and many other places where winds are &s;old, he works in the children of di&s;obedience, and hath nothing to do with thy poor &s;ervants; for though thou may&s;t ju&s;tly for our &s;ins give Satan power over us, as thou did&s;t over thy dear &s;ervant <HI>Job,</HI> yet where thou give&s;t a particular faith to be free from Sa|thans &s;torms and witchcrafts, thou art plea&s;ed to grant that which is believed, And in great love it plea&s;ed Je&s;us Chri&s;t to give a gratious an&s;wer to my &s;pirit, and &s;aid, Be not afraid, your lives &s;hall be &s;aved; in&s;tantly I replyed, Lord, let it be for all the Per&s;ons in the &s;hip; he &s;aid, be it &s;o; then I pre&s;&s;ed for the goods in the &s;hip; Lord &s;aid I, there are my L. G. goods, &amp; M. G. goods, Let them be &s;afe; but they are not there, &s;aid Je&s;us Chri&s;t; no Lord &s;aid I, they are fighting thy battels; Je&s;us Chri&s;t an&s;wered, the goods &s;hall
<PB N="11" REF="7">all be &s;afe, and the &s;hip likewi&s;e, and nothing mi&s;carry; then I gave humble thanks, and departed; and as I was going out, I thought Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid to me, it is granted for half fifty, go no more to Sea in Winter. I further dream'd that the Devil and his Imps were very earne&s;t with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to get leave to de|&s;troy the Governour of <HI>Wexford,</HI> by the &s;torm; but the Lord &s;aid, it &s;hould not be; &s;ome there were that had Barks at <HI>Wex|ford,</HI> that attended to &s;peak with Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I could not tell what they &s;aid, they di&s;cour&s;ed much about the Governour, and all that I heard Chri&s;t &s;ay, was, that winter was not yet come for them at <HI>Wexford;</HI> then I thought I met with Captain <HI>Haire|bottel,</HI> who had very great re&s;pect &s;hewn to him, and I thought his prayers did us very much good, and he was very much com|mended for his tenderne&s;s to the &s;ick Souldiers at <HI>Wexford.</HI> I thought there were other men from <HI>Wexford</HI> that came for &s;afe pa&s;&s;ages, and one Officer was very earne&s;t for a &s;hip that he was to come in, and I heard this expre&s;&s;ion concerning him, we mu&s;t take &s;pecial care of his &s;hip, for he was very tender and kind to the poor &s;ick &s;ouldiers, and much di&s;cour&s;e I heard about &s;ick &s;ouldiers. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid, if &s;torms will not do, I have o|ther afflictions to make them more tender-hearted and pitiful; methought the per&s;on that &s;o walked in the room, &s;pake much to this effect, that there would be many &s;torms by rea&s;on of much hardheartedne&s;s, to break and melt their &s;pirits, &s;ince which (ble&s;&s;ed be God) Captain <HI>Lucus</HI> is come &s;afe in the wild <HI>Bear,</HI> one whom I ob&s;erved in <HI>Wexford</HI> to be very liberal, tender-hearted, and compa&s;&s;ionate to the poor Souldiers; whereupon I awaked: this dream la&s;ted about two hours, all which time the &s;torm increa&s;ed; my Wife told me that &s;he jogged me above twenty times to awaken me, and wondred that I &s;hould &s;leep, &s;eeing we were all &s;o near the point of death; &s;aid I to her, peace my dear heart, be quiet, we &s;hall all be &s;afe: Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed me our lives, be not afraid; and told her all my dream, whereat &s;he was much amazed, but could not believe any &s;afety, and urged me to prayer, being her &s;elf well re&s;olved to dye, cheerfully &s;ubmitting to Gods good plea|&s;ure; but told me &s;he had a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon her &s;pirit by way of que&s;tion, as if the Lord had &s;poken to her, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;pare her life at this time, whether &s;he could be content to &s;uffer for him? whereunto &s;he found her heart mo&s;t ready and willing, by the Lords a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to lay
<PB N="12" REF="8">down her life for his glory; but my own heart was then gi|ving thanks, and brim-full of comfort.</P>
<P>I related my dream to Liutenant Col. <HI>Saunders,</HI> Major <HI>Bee, Ben.</HI> and the two Maids that were in the Cabbin. And &s;ent in for Captain <HI>Stoaks,</HI> the Ma&s;ter, the Gunner, <HI>Bennet,</HI> and Mar&s;hal, and bid them be of good cheer, and ply their bu&s;i|ne&s;s, for we &s;hould be all &s;afe, telling them what I had dream|ed; they admired at my confidence, and Captain <HI>Stoaks</HI> could not believe it, (&s;aid he) I know God is very merciful and can do much; but the Ship hath five foot water in the hould, which the Pumpe could not reach, being choaked, and very &s;ubject to leaks, being twenty years old, and then it was about nine at night, the &s;torm increa&s;ing, and they not knowing where about they were, I told them that I was a&s;&s;ured of &s;afety, as if I were on Shore, and one word more I had dreamed, which I told them of; &s;aid I to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, what if the Ship &s;hould break a&s;under? He an&s;wered me, you &s;hall be as &s;afe as if you were in <HI>Codds</HI> boat (a boat at <HI>Wexford</HI> that we went in towards the &s;hip in the bay, and were driven back &s;everal times) or as if you were in the Go|vernors hou&s;e in <HI>Wexford;</HI> what impre&s;&s;ion it had upon their &s;pi|rits I know not, but &s;ome that were in the great Cabbin told me that they did verily believe it, and that their hearts were much quieted by what I &s;aid. The &s;torm increa&s;ed, and a great noy&s;e was made in the &s;hip, the water came in at the great Cab|bin windows, the &s;hip ready to over&s;et and to founder; many &s;creeks and cryes out, now we are gone, and yet my confidence and a&s;&s;urance increa&s;ed, I bid them pray and be thankful, for they were as &s;afe as if they were on &s;hoar; &s;till my poor wife &s;aid it could not be; I told her I was &s;ure of it; &s;he mu&s;t lye &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvation of our God.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I much marvelled at the change that was wrought in my own &s;pirit, from a trembling fearfulne&s;s to a rejoycing a&s;&s;urance; and con&s;idering it was but a dream, I thought I might pre&s;ume too much in an over-confidence, and was jealous over my own heart le&s;t I &s;hould offend, begging the Lords extraor|dinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;utable to the pre&s;ent danger; but the more I checkt my heart of pre&s;umption, the more did my faith mount upon the wing as if I had been upon dry ground, and had not &s;o much fear as the thou&s;and part of the weight of a hair: the poor &s;hip workt for her life, and the Sea-men took infinite pains, two parts being fallen &s;ick, &amp; the other 30. were continually at it, &s;om|times
<PB N="13" REF="8">they were in a little hopes, &s;ometimes their &s;ouls ready to faint; about twelve at night, he that was at the Helm by my Cabbin &s;aid all was broken, the water came in there; a little be|fore they cryed out, that the fore&s;ail was &s;plit and carried away, and the Anchors thrown over board to lighten the &s;hip, yet all this while my &s;pirit was the &s;ame, in a thankful admiration for &s;o great a deliverance, and &s;aid, all &s;hall be as well as heart could wi&s;h; when they &s;poke of lightning the &s;hip, my wife call'd to Capt. <HI>Stoaks,</HI> and bad him if he thought &s;it to throw over &s;ome Trunks which we had in the &s;hip, which I liked very well (as it was in <HI>Pauls</HI>-&s;torm) in regard of others that were in the &s;hip, but for my own part, I &s;aid I would not have any thing thrown over, for I knew all would be well, and (&s;o ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord of Seas) about four in the morning, the &s;torm abated, my heart was in a very thankful po&s;ture, and that Wedne&s;day night after, when the Sea-men &s;aid, we were in mo&s;t danger, entring into <HI>Ca&s;tle-Haven</HI> in the dark, that we mu&s;t have the wind turn twice in half an hour to &s;ave us, fir&s;t to carry us from the breach of the &s;hore to the <HI>Staggs,</HI> and then to carry us off from them: when we were within a Cables length of the &s;hore, and the Sea|men divided, not knowing what to do, Captain <HI>Stoakes</HI> bad let fall an Anchor, or el&s;e we are all dead men, others &s;aid, try to get off from &s;hore, and there was a great &s;creek that all was gone, I was not one jot afraid, but told them they were fure to get &s;afe to Land, and the &s;hip to a Harbour, and the Lord &s;hewed him&s;elf kind to poor &s;inners.</P>
<P>One thing, though it &s;eem to be of &s;mall importance, yet it runs much in my mind, and I mu&s;t needs relate it; I thought that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid to me, that the goods &s;hould be all &s;afe, and nothing hurt or lo&s;t by the &s;torm, but when we came to look for our things, we mi&s;t a looking-gla&s;s and a Pi&s;tol, the gla&s;s-ca&s;e was all broke and &s;hivered in many pieces by the rouling of the &s;hip, being in one of the Boxes or Cabbin-che&s;ts in the great Cabbin among other things, but the Gla&s;s it &s;elf was not &s;o much as broken or crackt, and the ca&s;e, though in eight or ten pieces, yet might ea&s;ily be joyned and glued together, that it is not wor&s;e by a farthing, which &s;eems to me very admirable; I told Captain <HI>Stoakes</HI> of it, and de&s;ired him, if po&s;&s;ible, to help me to my Pi|&s;tol, he examined them about it, but it could not be heard of, till the very day the &s;hip was going out of the Harbour, and then &s;omebody that had it, could not be quiet till he brought it out,
<PB N="14" REF="9" MS="y">to let us &s;ee how weak our faith and confidence is in the Lord, and that he will perform with his poor &s;ervants to a Title of his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>I know that u&s;ually dreams follow mens natural inclination, or their daily conver&s;ation, as in <HI>Pharaohs Butler</HI> and <HI>Baker,</HI> they dreamed of wine and baskets of meat, matters about which they were ordinarily imployed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 40. and I having been in a continued meditation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his love, power, bowels of pity towards his members, it was mo&s;t likely, that if I dreamed of any thing I &s;hould dream of him, as many times upon the Sab|both night I have dreamed that I was in the very &s;ame compa|ny, and at the &s;ame exerci&s;es as I was upon the day; and indeed the con&s;ideration of Chri&s;ts humanity, his being at Sea, and his experimental knowledg of our mi&s;eries much &s;upported me; how many prayers did we put up for a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age, which though they do not move the Lord by any eloquence, as an Orator moves his hearers, yet they move the Lord, as the cries of children make the bowels of their Parents yern towards them; and we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;hadows and &s;ub&s;tances; dreams are but the appearances of things which are not; natural dreams are ei|ther &s;inful, deceitful and vain, as <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 29.8. the hungry thir&s;ty man dreams, that he eats and drinks, but he awakes, and his &s;oul is faint for food; or el&s;e they are repre&s;entations of things pa&s;t, which were really done; or things to come, which falls out accor|dingly; and the matter of the dream is principally to be regarded; &s;ome Chri&s;tians have had difficult places of Scripture expounded to them in their dreams, as they have told me.</P>
<P>Therefore although dreams which are natural and ordinary, be of little or no account, yet extraordinary dreams many times prove true; as if one cry in his dream or be &s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep that he feels not pinching, when the Imagination is &s;o extraordinarily powerful, and that the party dreaming is confidently per&s;waded that it will come to pa&s;s, it commonly proves accordingly, as that of <HI>Katharin de Medicis</HI> Queen of <HI>France,</HI> who dreamed that <HI>Hen.</HI> the &s;econd &s;hould be killed at the Tilt, and &s;aid &s;he would venture her &s;oul upon it. And &s;o he was killed by a Scots man, <HI>Montgomery,</HI> as &s;he dreamed. <HI>Petrarch</HI> in <HI>Padova</HI> dreamed that a <HI>Scorpion</HI> &s;tung him to death, that was in one of the Lyons that &s;tand before a &s;tatue which they fondly call <HI>Sancta Ju&s;tina;</HI> the next morning he told his dream, went thither and put in his hand into the hole, and out came a Scorpion which
<PB N="15" REF="9">poy&s;oned him, whereof he died: the great Souldier <HI>Fare&s;e</HI> the night before he dyed, dreamed that he was drowned, and that his Saint <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> could not carry him over the River, and the next day the Ferry-boat &s;unk, and he was drowned.</P>
<P>In 1629. <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> a Prote&s;tant Marque&s;&s;es Daughter in <HI>Poland</HI> dreamed that Je&s;us Chri&s;t had told her comfortable things for the Prote&s;tants, as the good &s;ucce&s;s of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the death of the Emperors General <HI>Wal&s;ten;</HI> and that it might be the better believed, &s;he &s;hould dye four days and re|vive again; one Mini&s;ter <HI>Coturnius</HI> &s;lighted it as a delu&s;ion and vain fancie; &s;he told him that God was angry with him, and &s;uch a day his only child &s;hould die and him&s;elf pre&s;ently after, which both proved true; &s;he likewi&s;e fell into a Trance for eight and fourty hours, and then revived and foretold victories of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> but that God would take him away, becau&s;e the people began to make a God of him, and thought him to be in|vincible. She dreamed that &s;he was married to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that &s;he had a Crown of Glory promi&s;ed her if &s;he could per&s;evere in the faith, and told her &s;he would be mockt and &s;coft at by many who would not believe but that &s;uch vi&s;ions procee|ded from imagination, melancholy humours, or weakne&s;s of brain, but bade her not be di&s;couraged, &s;hewing her a cup of blood, which he &s;aid he would pour upon tho&s;e that per&s;ecute his &s;ervants; and that &s;he prayed very earne&s;tly for the &s;alvation of a deer friend of hers who was in arms again&s;t the Prote&s;tants, but that &s;he could not prevail for the &s;alvation of any of her friends, but only for her &s;elf, and that night the &s;ame party died; &s;he likewi&s;e in her dream &s;aw two great per&s;ons coming to be judged, one a Papi&s;t who had prayed much to his St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and de&s;ired to be admitted into Heaven, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t bad him go to Hell to Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> whither he was immediately dragged; and the other was a Prote&s;tant, who argued for his &s;al|vation becau&s;e he fought again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, and the Mini&s;ters a&s;|&s;ured him of Heaven: Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;aid he, will put out his candle in <HI>Germany,</HI> for it gives a fal&s;e light, it &s;hines without, but it is full of filth and &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s within: &s;he likewi&s;e &s;aw a man upon a Tree adored by many; and &s;ome Lyons came to the Tree and pluckt it down, and an Eagle was flying away, which the Lyons caught, and toar in pieces, and asking Je&s;us Chri&s;t the
<PB N="16" REF="10" MS="y">meaning of that vi&s;ion, he told, that the man was that horrid bea&s;t the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> my capital enemy, not a Pa&s;tor, but a Woolf, that &s;ays, behold I am &s;et aloft, who dare come to touch me? the Lyons are the <HI>French, Engli&s;h, Swedes, Hollanders, Ve|netians</HI> and others that &s;hall pluck down the proud bea&s;t, and pour out my wrath upon her, and her adherents, and that it &s;hould begin about 1650. and be compleat by 1666. in her &s;leep &s;he was heard to &s;ay; welcome Husband, and laughed heartily, and as &s;he awaked, &s;he &s;aid, farewell dear Husband, and &s;he drea|med many things more which fell out accordingly, being a ver|tuous child, naturally merry.</P>
<P>In 1633. &s;he was married in <HI>Le&s;no</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Mini&s;ters in <HI>Germany</HI> have &s;ub&s;cribed to it, for they &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ulted about it, and &s;ent into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> for a&s;&s;i|&s;tance and advice, and the re&s;ult of the conference (which Mr. <HI>Deodate</HI> &s;hewed me at <HI>Geneva</HI>) came to this; in <HI>Chri&s;tinaes</HI> dream, they did believe there was a Divine light: for fir&s;t the young Lady was regenerate, and very zealous for the glory of God, &s;o there was a good life in the per&s;on dreaming: Secondly, there was a full per&s;wa&s;ion of heart that it was from God, and it would prove true: Thirdly, there was a certitude in the event, the party was not deceived, for it proved &s;o, and it was likewi&s;e their judgements, that in a time of general per&s;ecution, or &s;ome extraordinary eminent danger, God might and did many times &s;peak comfortable things to his people in dreams, as in the late <HI>Bohemian</HI> Wars, many <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> were admoni&s;ht in their dreams to go to places of &s;ecurity, which they attending, were &s;afe from the enemy; as the Angel of the Lord appeared to <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in a dream, and bad him flee with Je&s;us Chri&s;t into <HI>Egypt, Mat.</HI> 2.13. and others that neglected &s;uch dreams have afterwards re|pented it.</P>
<P>The Lord keep us all that were made partakers of &s;o great a mercy, in an humble believing and thankful po&s;ture, that we may &s;pend the remainder of our new lives in the zeal of his &s;ervice, as tho&s;e that having their lives prolonged &s;o extraordinarily are exceedingly obliged more then others to walk an&s;werably to &s;o great a mercy.</P>
