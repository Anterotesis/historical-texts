<HEAD>A REMONSTRATION Of the French Subiects, Pro|fe&s;&s;ing the Reformed Religion, vnto the French KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is &s;trange, and almo&s;t in|credible, that among&s;t &s;o many Subiects (which God hath beene plea&s;ed to &s;ub|mit vnder the obey&s;ance of your Maie&s;tie) who boa&s;t ordinarily, that they are much affected to the good of your affaires, &amp; the con|&s;ervation of your Crowne; that neverthele&s;&s;e, there hath not beene one, which hath endevoured and enforced him&s;elfe, to quench the fire which takes daily hold of your State, and by little and little con&s;umes the &s;ame: and that to the contrary, there is found a great number that haue taken great paines to adde more fewell to it, and are yet daily &s;eeking artificiall tricks and devi&s;es to maintaine and increa&s;e the &s;ame. By right, it &s;hould be their worke, who can make Peace and Warre when they plea&s;e, if their private ends, and particular profit which made them to rai&s;e tho&s;e troubles, contrary to the minde and intention of your Maie&s;tie,
<PB N="2" REF="3">did not draw them backe, and not of tho&s;e which are a&s;|&s;aulted and pur&s;ued in their con&s;ciences, honors, goods, and liues, and haue no other intention then to defend and pre&s;erue them&s;elues from violences, having never de|te&s;ted any thing more then troubles, and &s;editious com|motions; and to the contrary, nothing more loved and procured, then the con&s;ervation of Peace. Wherefore, all the Lords, Gentlemen, and all your Maie&s;ties other Subiects that follow them, making profe&s;&s;ion of the Re|formed Religion, moved and driven by the affection and naturall Obligation that they owe vnto your Maie&s;tie, and to the con&s;ervation of your Kingdome, they nei|ther could or would v&s;e any longer delay, for to &s;eeke and propoune of their &s;ide (as they haue done continually) all the fit and convenient meanes they could devi&s;e, to pre&s;erue your State from ruine and &s;ubver&s;ion, which haue threatned the &s;ame many times, and yet at this pre|&s;ent doe more then ever before, and to ree&s;tabli&s;h a good Peace and publique tranquillitie, who having continually &s;hewed them&s;elues prompt and willing to embrace the &s;ame, it is manife&s;t enough, in what dangers and in con|veniences they were likely to fall, if God through his meere mercie had not pre&s;erved them. In &s;uch manner that they haue but &s;mall hope, to come to their de&s;ire, vn|le&s;&s;e the Almightie God, will be plea&s;ed to chauge the hearts of their enemies, which are round about you, and incline them to a pacification, or Peace. Looking ra|ther that this their good di&s;po&s;ition which they now ma|nife&s;t, and their endevours which they will v&s;e, for to e|&s;tabli&s;h a firme and perfect Vnion betwixt all your Sub|iects, both of the one and the other Religion, in &s;tead of being received and embraced. &s;hall be &s;landered, and &s;ini|&s;terly interpreted, as they haue beene continually, by tho&s;e which hate and feare nothing more then this recon|ciliation. That neverthele&s;&s;e, the &s;ayd Lords, Gentlemen, and other that follow them, having continually taken great care, to make their actions daily more and more ma|nife&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="3">vnto your Maie&s;tie, and to leaue a&s;&s;ured &s;ignes and witne&s;&s;es of their de&s;ire, which is to liue and die in the obedience, and naturall &s;ubiection which they owe vnto your Maie&s;tie, and to make it appeare to all the world, how much their hearts and wills are differing from the impo&s;tures and &s;landers, which their adver&s;aries, adhe|rents, and mini&s;ters lay vpon them; and that the Forces which they haue beene compelled to gather again&s;t their mindes, doe tend to no other effect then to maintaine and con&s;erue their Religion, honours, liues, and goods. They haue thought that &s;uch con&s;iderations ought not to hinder or &s;tay them in their hunting and purcha&s;ing the effect of &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;alutary a Peace for this Kingdome, and to giue witne&s;&s;e of their humilitie, reverence, and re&s;pect towards your Maie&s;tie, which they would haue &s;ooner done, if they had not e&s;teemed and iudged that their enemies would haue thought, or at lea&s;t haue gone about to make others beleeue, that the nece&s;&s;itie had compelled them vnto the &s;ame, con&s;idering their Enemies a&s;&s;ured your Maie&s;tie, that they were not likely to receiue any ayde from forraigne partes, and if they &s;hould, that they had no money to giue them content. But it is certaine and known that they never haue wanted aide and &s;uccour from aboue, and that their forces are &s;uch that none can denie, but that they are able to re&s;i&s;t their Ene|mies, and to execute &s;uch ill de&s;ignes if they would as they are taxed withall. So then in the time of the fir&s;t troubles or Civill Warres the decea&s;ed Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> be&s;ides the Lords, Gentlemen and other that did accompany him, did receiue and accept of the conditions of Peace, con|cerning onely the Religion and the libertie of their Con|&s;ciences: pre&s;ently after the death of the late Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> and the Mar&s;hall of Saint <HI>Andrew,</HI> and the impri|&s;onment of the late Con&s;table <HI>Montmorancy,</HI> which were the principall heads and conductors of the Armie. If in the &s;econd troubles, as &s;oone as was offered vnto the a|fore&s;ayd Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and his followers and parta|kers
<PB N="4" REF="4">the re&s;tabli&s;hing of the exerci&s;e of their Religion, not|with&s;tanding they were affi&s;ted mightily by forraigne forces and readie to a&s;&s;ault the Towne of <HI>Chartres,</HI> at the &s;ight of their Enemies campe, which was mo&s;t wholy disbanded and di&s;ordered; And that onely at the denun|ciation of Peace, made by a Trumpet &s;ent in the Kings name, the &s;ayd Prince did not onely &s;urcea&s;e from the a&s;&s;ault in hand, but commaunded the fiege wholy to be rai&s;ed, and his Armie to retyre, reporting neverthele&s;&s;e no other reward for his prompt obedience, then a bloo|die peace, full of perfidiou&s;nes. If in the &s;ayde troubles the next day after the Battaile at Saint <HI>Denis,</HI> the &s;ayd Prince did &s;end vnto the King <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Tiligny,</HI> to &s;hew his Maie&s;tie, the ruine and de&s;olation that was likely to fall vpon this Kingdome, if it were &s;uffered that for|raigne forces &s;hould invade the &s;ame, which were vpon the frontiers readie to enter, and to propo&s;e and &s;hew the meanes, and remedies to attaine a peace, touching one|ly matters of Religion, Notwith&s;tanding hee had the bet|ter hand in the &s;ayd battle; the late Con&s;table <HI>Montmo|rancy</HI> chiefe of the Armie there being flaine. To be &s;hort, if all your Edicts had beene alwayes made, and the peace agreed, in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when tho&s;e of the reformed Re|ligion had meanes by their forces to make their Enemies belieue them, if they would haue abu&s;ed the &s;ame, and that in al their parlies &amp; treaties of peace, there is no mention made of any thing el&s;e then of matters of Religion, and that their Enemies haue never beene brought to a peace or pacification, but by nece&s;&s;itie, being not able by open force to attempt any thing more again&s;t them; Neverthe|le&s;&s;e to overcome more manife&s;tly their adver&s;aries, of the &s;launders and impo&s;tures which they publi&s;h every houre again&s;t the &s;aid Lords, Gentlemen, and others that follow them, willingly pa&s;&s;ing by the vnfaithfulnes, want of cou|rage, &amp; de&s;loyalty, v&s;ed and practi&s;ed again&s;t them in for|mer time. They declare &amp; prote&s;t this day before your Ma+ie&s;ty, as before God, that how&s;oever they haue vntill this
<PB REF="4">time been dealt withal, that they neuerthele&s;&s;e neuer thought to impute it vnto your <HI>Maie&s;ty,</HI> as very well knowing, that your <HI>Maie&s;ties</HI> nature is not agreeing with &s;uch rigours, wherof you haue &s;hewed &s;o many open demon&s;trations, that none rightly may doubt of it: and much le&s;&s;e haue they de&s;ired to change, or dimini&s;h in any manner the good will, and naturall affection, which they haue borne continually to the con&s;eruation, aduancement &amp; greatnes of your State. And if by all the effects afore&s;aid, it hath been &s;eene and knowne manife&s;tly, that they had neuer any &s;cope nor intention, then to &s;erue God according to his command, and the in&s;truction of his holy word, vnder the obedience and authority of your Acts, and Proclamations, and to be maintained, and pre&s;erued equally with your other Subiects, in their honours, lifes, and goods; but be&s;ides this they will at this pre|&s;ent, make &s;uch a proofe and tryall; that their ene|mies them&s;elues, will neuer doubt of it or call the &s;ame in que&s;tion, not that they intend to go about to iu&s;tifie their former actions. And much le&s;&s;e doe they intend to copitulate with your <HI>Maie&s;ty,</HI> very well knowing by the grace of God, what is the duty of good and faithfull Subiects towards their <HI>Soneraine Prince</HI> and naturall <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But Sir becau&s;e it is &s;ufficiently knowne how they <HI>valewe iour,</HI> faith and words, which ought to be holy, &s;acred and inuiolable, and with what boldne&s;&s;e haue they abu&s;ed your name and authority, to the great perill and danger of your Subiects, which make pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the Reformed Religion, it will not bee thought &s;trange that the &s;ame in all humble manner be&s;eech your <HI>Maie&s;ty</HI> to bee plea&s;ed to declare by a &s;olemnell, perpetuall, and irreuocable Edict, verified
<PB REF="5">and regi&s;tred in all your Parlements, and other So|uerain Courts, of Iu&s;tices, to the end that by the &s;ame tho&s;e may be bridled and kept in, which &s;o many times herebefore haue beene &s;o bold as to infringe and violate them (and that without any puni&s;hment) which the late <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> of happy memory, your Father had made, and your &s;elfe confirmed. And &s;eeing that the&s;e wich neuer could endure the v|nion and re&s;t among&s;t your Subiects, cau&s;ed by the meanes of the ob&s;eruation of the &s;aid Edicts, they haue begunne to alter and corrupt the &s;ame by new interruptions; and modifications directely con|trary to the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;aid Edicts, and the intention of your <HI>Maie&s;ty.</HI> They very humbly re|que&s;t your <HI>Maie&s;ty</HI> to grant and agree generally vn|to all your Subiects, of what quality or condition &s;oeuer they be, free exerci&s;e of the &s;aid Religion in all Cities, Townes, villages, and boroughs in all places and parts of your Kingdome, and territories vnder your obedience and protection, without any exception or re&s;eruation, modification or re&s;tri|ction of per&s;ons, of time, or places, with all the a&s;|&s;urances thereunto nece&s;&s;ary and required.</P>
<P>And there aboue to order and inioyne euery one to make publike profe&s;&s;ion either of the one or the o|ther Religion, to the intent that many abu&s;ing this benefice and grace may not fallitno Athei&s;me, and earnall liberty, licen&s;ing them&s;elues of all exerci&s;e and profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and not de&s;iring any thing el&s;e but that all good orders, the policy, and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall di&s;cipline be quite reenuer&s;ed and abo|li&s;hed. A thing certainly too dangerous and perni|cious, and vn&s;ufferable.</P>
<P>And further, SIR, &s;eeing your &s;aid &s;ubiectis
<PB REF="5">doe not doubt, that tho&s;e which alwaies haue built the foundation of their de&s;&s;eings vpon Flanders, and calumniations which they very impudently publi&s;h to make them odious not onely to their party, but likewi&s;e to other, &s;hall not leaue to diuulge, that your &s;aid Subiects will rather wilfully without any rea&s;on defend that which they haue once re&s;olued to belieue, concerning the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, then to correct them&s;elues and retreate any point: They declare and prote&s;t as they haue euer done, that if in any article of their confe&s;&s;ion of faith they can in&s;truct them by the word of God comprehended in the Canonicall bookes of the Scripture: That they runne a&s;tray from the doctrine of the Prophes and A|po&s;tles. That pre&s;ently their will &s;hake hands with them, and be of they opinion and &s;ide that &s;hall teach them better out of Gods word; and long agoe they &s;hould haue done the &s;ame if any error had been pro|ued in their articles.</P>
<P>And to this effect they de&s;ire nothing more, then a meeting at a free, generall, and lawfully called Councell. Where euery one may be heard, to pro|duce his rea&s;ons, which &s;hall bee confirmed or con|uicted by Gods word alone. Which is the only cour&s;e taken in antient times in all like occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>By this meanes SIR, you &s;hall bee &s;ure that God will &s;hew your <HI>Maie&s;ty,</HI> this fauour that you &s;hall &s;ee &s;hortly the heartes and mindes of your Subiects v|nited and reconciled, and your Kingdome to returne in the former e&s;tate brightne&s;&s;e and dignity: to the &s;hame and confu&s;ion of your and our enemies, which haue endeauoured the contrary.</P>
<P>Moreouer your <HI>Maie&s;tie</HI> will bee plea&s;ed to take the paines, and con&s;ider exactely and iudge (if you
<PB REF="6">bee &s;o di&s;po&s;ed) if it be better to tarry for a heauy and bloudie victory of the two armies, that are now in your Kingdome, wherein the conquerour is a&s;|well to loo&s;e as hee that &s;hall be vanqui&s;hed. Or el&s;e to imploy them in the &s;eruice of your <HI>Maie&s;tie,</HI> and for the good of our owne affaires, vpon diuers faire occa&s;ions daily offered, &s;o much concerning the tran|quillity and con&s;eruation of your Crown as none are comparable vnto the &s;ame that haue beene pre&s;ented in our time:</P>
<P>And by the&s;e meanes to &s;end the tempe&s;t, and foule weather in the&s;e places, from whence it came. Whereunto your afore&s;aid Subiects are re&s;olued, as likewi&s;e to all other things that &s;hall tend to your good and the greatne&s;&s;e of your State being readie to imploy to the &s;ame effect all their e&s;tates, and meanes, which God hath plea&s;ed to grant them, be&s;ides their bodies to their vttermo&s;t power. Not acknowledging in this world any other Soue|raing or Principalites then yours: in which obedience and &s;ubiection they will liue and die, as your mo&s;t hum|ble, mo&s;t faithfull, and obe|dient Seruants, and Subiects.</P>
