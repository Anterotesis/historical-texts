<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE &s;ea&s;on &s;uiting my de|&s;ire having found &s;o fit an occa&s;ion to &s;end to you, I thought good things be|ing for the pre&s;ent &s;o well with us, (by Gods ble&s;&s;ing, and the valour of our &s;mall forces) to give you a true information in what E&s;tate the Kingdome is in at this pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Many Townes of indifferent &s;trength wee have taken from the Rebells. Namely the&s;e,</P>
<P><HI>Drogheda</HI> taken by Captaine <HI>Chri&s;topher Lof|tus</HI> with the lo&s;&s;e of twenty five men, the Re|bells loo&s;ing neere three hundred.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e taken by the Lord <HI>More,</HI> who
<PB N="4" REF="3">beate the Rebells, and tooke &s;tore of Muniti|on which the Rebells were forced to leave behind them, by rea&s;on that the Towne was too hot for them.</P>
<P><HI>VVickloo,</HI> and <HI>Waxford</HI> taken by young <HI>Charles Coote,</HI> &s;onne to that valiant (and deplo|red) Commander &s;ir <HI>Charles Coote; Colorane</HI> taken by the Deputy Pre&s;ident of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">oo</HI> taken by the Lord <HI>Grande&s;on,</HI> who in that &s;ervice was &s;hot through the left thigh, entering a breach.</P>
<P><HI>Clogham</HI> was taken by Captaine <HI>Gibbs, Ma|nah<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI> was taken by &s;ir <HI>Richard Greenevill, Gal|way</HI> and <HI>Garma&s;ton</HI> having beene be&s;ieged long by the Rebells, was releived by the Earle of <HI>Ormond,</HI> Leivtenant Generall of his Maje&s;ties Forces. As for <HI>Lymrick,</HI> that was a place which did do much hurt to our proceedings, being &s;o &s;trongly fortified by the Rebells, that though our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> forces had made many at|tempts again&s;t it, yet they were repul&s;t, and forced to recreate as vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;&s;e &s;o it plea&s;ed God to ble&s;&s;e us, that he put it into the heart of Captaine <HI>Bart|let,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3">a Scotch Commander, to frame a project, and to put that project in execution.</P>
<P>For on &s;atterday the 9th. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the &s;aid Captaine <HI>Bartlet</HI> came to my Lord Lievte|nant Generall, and de&s;ired him that he would bee plea&s;ed to let him imploy five hundred men, and a troope of hor&s;e, in a de&s;igne a|gain&s;t the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Limrick,</HI> withall promi&s;ing confidently, that hee would take the Ca&s;tle, or upon the fayling thereof hee would loo&s;e his head, the Lord Lievtenant being loath that a Commander of &s;uch worth &s;hould en|gage him&s;elfe in a de&s;igne of &s;uch probable danger, and improbable to pro&s;per, u&s;ed much per&s;wa&s;ions, de&s;ireing him to avert his inten|tion, &s;ince an attempt upon that Ca&s;tle &s;o &s;trongly fortified mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity prove the ruine of him and his Company, withall in|timating that if hee &s;hould receive a defeat by the Rebells, and bee lo&s;t in that de&s;igne, it would give an occa&s;ion of incouragement to the Rebells, and bee a meanes to di&s;hearten the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were in great want of &s;uch noble and well di&s;po&s;ed Commanders as him&s;elfe.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P> Notwith&s;tanding all this the &s;aid Captaine <HI>Bartlet</HI> would not be per&s;waded but that hee &s;hould take the Ca&s;tle, which the Lord Leivte|nant &s;eing, gave way to his de&s;ire, withall gi|ving command that five hundred of the pro|pere&s;t and forewarde&s;t men &s;hould be a&s;&s;ign|ed for him, and &s;ir <HI>Richard Greenevills</HI> Troope of Hor&s;e, which hee having received, marcht pre&s;ently away from the Army to a little vil|lage, which they had that day plundered, where hee cau&s;ed them to &s;earch for all the Trou&s;es and habits of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> with which he habited one halfe of his men, making them appeare ju&s;t like <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Kemes, having &s;o done, he out of that part of his men which remain|ed elected thirty mu&s;quetiers which he placed, (being befriended by the darkne&s;&s;e of the night) on the back&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle in a deep ditch, giving them command not to &s;tirre till they &s;ee the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> forces out of the Ca&s;tle. Likewi&s;e his troop of hor&s;e he placed in a little grove, which was of one &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, &s;ome three Bowes &s;hots off, having thus pla|ced his men, and giving them directions what they &s;hould doe, hee &s;ent out tho&s;e that were
<PB N="7" REF="4">habited like <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> men, to walke round the Ca&s;tle, and to waite till that hee &s;hould come up to charge the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The day appearing Captain <HI>Bartlet</HI> led on his men and beat a feirce <HI>alarum,</HI> which the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in the Ca&s;tle &s;eeing, began &s;traight to arme them|&s;elves, but on the &s;udden they &s;ee the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> come to their re&s;cue, for the di&s;gui&s;ed <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;eemed to charge Captaine <HI>Bartlet</HI> very fiercely, onely with powder to be &s;hot, after a little time &s;pent in this &s;eemeing combate, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> falling down thicke and threefold, lying as if they were dead, and the re&s;t flying, which the Rebells &s;eeing, &s;traight i&s;&s;ued out of the Ca&s;tle, pur&s;uing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that fled, not once noting or medling with tho&s;e that lay on the ground as dead.</P>
<P>Which the 30. Ma&s;quetiers &s;eeing ro&s;e, and with all &s;peed &s;ei&s;ed on the Ca&s;tle, killing tho&s;e that were the guard, who were unpro|vided of defence being overjoyed with their &s;uppo&s;ed victory.</P>
<P>The Troope of hor&s;e clapt in betweene them and the Ca&s;tle and the &s;uppo&s;ed dead men ro&s;e and charged them cutting them off
<PB N="8" REF="5">without mercy, &s;o that they at that time kild above 3. thou&s;and of the Rebells, and tooke many pri&s;oners, not loo&s;ing above three men, only &s;ome few hurt, this is a reall truth, and the true manner of his taking the Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Limrick,</HI> for which &s;ervice he is &s;o admired, that the &s;ouldiers are greedy to goe with him upon the mo&s;t de&s;perate de&s;ignes.</P>
<P>Thus it plea&s;eth God to fight for us, and wee doubt not (were the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions of <HI>England</HI> once com|po&s;ed) and more ayd &s;ent over, we &s;hould quickly re|duce this Kingdome to its former obedience, and ba|ni&s;h all tho&s;e blood-thir&s;ty <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> out of the Land.</P>
<P>This is the &s;umme of all that hath happened lately, or is worthy my paines or your knowledge.</P>
<P>Onely I de&s;ire you in requitall to retaine me the chiefe Heads of your proceedings in <HI>England,</HI> for now <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> newes is as much longed for here, as <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> newes was lately in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I received a letter from <HI>Chichester,</HI> which informed me that my Lord Deputies &s;onne was taken pri&s;oner at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and &s;ent up to the Parliament, pray &s;end me word whether it be true or otherwi&s;e.</P>
