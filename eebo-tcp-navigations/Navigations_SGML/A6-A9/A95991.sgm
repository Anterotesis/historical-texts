<HEAD>The humble Petition of THO. VIOLET</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>_THat your Petitioner, in December la&s;t, finding the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> daily deceived in &s;everall Prizes that had beene unduly di&s;charged in the Court of <HI>Admiraltie,</HI> and el&s;e where &s;ince Augu&s;t la&s;t, to the value of many hundred thou&s;and pounds, which frauds, if continued, had proved highly prejudiciall to the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> by enabling the Dutch in their mi&s;|chievous practi&s;es to circumvent and eclip&s;e the glo|ry of this Nation, and all this con&s;tantly acted by &s;ome Merchants, and others, by compliance with &s;ome per&s;ons in tru&s;t in the <HI>Admiraltie.</HI></P>
<P>For prevention thereof for the future, your Peti|tioner did about the eighth of December la&s;t, deliver in writing unto the Lord <HI>Brad&s;hawe</HI> a Paper, di&s;co|vering that at that pre&s;ent time, a practi&s;e and com|bination was &s;et on foote and acted again&s;t the <HI>State,</HI> by &s;everall Merchants, and others, who at that time (combining with &s;ome publique mini&s;ters of for|raigne Princes, did endeavor and plot to put a blind on the <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Councell</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and having the connivance and a&s;si&s;tance of &s;ome per&s;ons in power and tru&s;t for the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> and <HI>Admiraltie,</HI> contri|ved by fraud, fal&s;e pretences and claimes, to get cleered out of the <HI>Admiraltie,</HI> &s;everall &s;hips taken as
<PB N="2" REF="3"> prize, but mo&s;t e&s;picially three rich Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> the <HI>George,</HI> and the <HI>Salvador,</HI> in which &s;hips your Petitioner had certaine intelligence there was many hundred thou&s;and pounds of Silver, and Mer|chandize for the accompt of &s;everall people in <HI>Am|&s;terdam, Dort,</HI> and other places of the <HI>united-Provinces</HI> (your Petitioner having beene imployed by the late King and his Councell, for making known many &s;ecret practi&s;es of the like nature unto them) your Petitioner out of his affection to the pro&s;peritie of this <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> did undertake to the Lord <HI>Brad|&s;hawe</HI> to unmaske the&s;e frauds.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance whereof, your Petitioner knowing how much it did concerne this <HI>Common-wealth</HI> to have the&s;e abu&s;es di&s;covered and made known, hee deli|vered &s;everall Papers unto &s;everall Members of the late <HI>Councell</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and to Doctor <HI>Walker</HI> in Decem|ber and January la&s;t, which did manife&s;t by what waies and practi&s;es the&s;e abu&s;es were daily commit|ted, which &s;ervice was &s;o acceptable to many of the <HI>Councell</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> that your Petitioner had an a&s;&s;urance from many of them, in the behalf of the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> that if your Petitioner could intitle the <HI>State</HI> to the Silver in the afore&s;aid &s;hips, and make it out by &s;ufficient proofe; then he &s;hould have all his E&s;tate both reall and per&s;onall re&s;tored unto him, which is under &s;eque&s;tration upon malicious and untrue information, or the full value thereof, which a|mounted unto the &s;ome of eleven thou&s;and pounds, to bee paid unto your Petitioner out of the Silver which your Petitioner &s;hould gaine to the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> out of the afore&s;aid prize-&s;hips, which by your Petitioners painfull endeavors, and to his great and va&s;t expence was then accordingly &s;tayed, and proofe made to entitle the <HI>State</HI> to all the Silver which is now coyning in the Tower.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong combinations and de|&s;ignes
<PB N="3" REF="3"> of &s;ome in the Court of <HI>Admiraltie,</HI> and &s;ome other, great ones in power, to defraud the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> as was intimated by Ma&s;ter <HI>James Stanieres</HI> let|ter, and in truth your Petitioner hath run as great hazard of being ruined both in his e&s;tate and per&s;on, for his prote&s;ting in the behalfe of the <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> again&s;t the di&s;charge of the&s;e &s;hips and Silver, which had then, without your Petitioners prote&s;t in Court, beene all di&s;charged, and at that time the Dutch had &s;uch a party, even in the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> that by &s;om of them your petitioner was di&s;couraged to proceed in this bu&s;ines, by which means the merchants were en|couraged to claime, as is well known to many hun|dreds of Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> in&s;omuch as your pe|titioner was enforced, in the face of the Court to charge ten &s;everall Merchants, who were then all in the Court of <HI>Admiraltie,</HI> for fraudulent practi&s;es, in laboring to di&s;charge the &s;aid Ships; and your peti|tioner did then declare to the Judges in the Court of <HI>Admiraltie,</HI> that if they did di&s;charge the &s;aid Ships and Silver, upon any pretence of any Merchants or other per&s;ons whom&s;oever, before your petitioners witne&s;&s;es were examined, they did not Judge, but give away the <HI>Common-wealths</HI> Trea&s;ure, and that your petitioner did appeale to the <HI>Parliament</HI> again&s;t their proceedings to di&s;charge the Silver; which did &s;o ex|a&s;perate the Judges in the <HI>Admiraltie,</HI> that they com|plained to the <HI>Councell</HI> of <HI>State</HI> again&s;t your petitioner, for endeavoring to &s;tay the Silver and &s;aid &s;hips, and upon full examination of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e before the Committee of forraigne-affaires, the&s;e &s;hips were notwith&s;tanding ordered to be &s;taid, and your peti|tioner ordered to pro&s;ecute with all expedition and vigilance, in the behalfe of the <HI>Common-wealth,,</HI> for entitling the <HI>State</HI> to it, which he hath done accor|dingly. Your Petitioner therefore humbly prayes your Honors to bee plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the great|ne&s;&s;e

<HEAD>A Copie of a Paper pre&s;ented the eighth of December 1652. to the Lord <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI> and Ma&s;ter <HI>Allen,</HI> by <HI>Thomas Violet,</HI> who the &s;ame day delivered the &s;aid Paper to the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and the Councel upon &s;everal debates before the Comittee of Forraigne affaires Ordered, the 13. of De|cember 1652. the &s;aid <HI>Tho. Violet</HI> to a&s;|&s;i&s;t, on the behalf of the <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> the pro&s;ecution in the high Court of <HI>Admi|ralty</HI> again&s;t the &s;hips <HI>Sam&s;on, Salvador</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> which had then aboard all the &s;ilver now coyning in the Tower, and that he &s;hould repair to D. <HI>VValker,</HI> Advocate for the <HI>Comonwealth,</HI> and acquaint him from time to time what he had to offer on behalf of the publique in reference to the &s;aid Ships.</HEAD>
<P>_MAy it plea&s;e your Honor, having under|&s;tood from &s;ome Merchants that the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>State</HI> have referred the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;adors claime to a great quantity of Trea&s;ure, which hee pretends to bee his Ma&s;ters, the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> &s;ilver, and all the &s;ilver belonging to his Ma&s;ters &s;ubjects (unto the <HI>Ad|miralty,</HI> there to receive a Judgement according to the equity of the cau&s;e.) In all humilitie I acknow|ledge the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> and that I beleeve they will doe their utmo&s;t, both for doing the Spa|ni&s;h
<PB N="6" REF="5"> Amba&s;&s;ador right, and to &s;ee the <HI>State</HI> &s;hall have what belongs ju&s;tly to them.</P>
<P>But withall I thinke it my duty to acquaint you, that the proceedings in the <HI>Admiralty</HI> mu&s;t goe accor|ding to the formes of that Court, except the Judges receive &s;ome extraordinary direction from the <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> or the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>State</HI> in this weighty bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; now I humbly &s;ay, the proceedings at Law will take &s;o much time up that the Merchants will &s;end into <HI>Spayne</HI> for new cocquets, and new Bills of lading, and for money no doubt they will get a po&s;t-Regi|&s;tring, and I am confident there are many in <HI>London</HI> can write and counterfeit Bills of lading and Cockets and never &s;end into <HI>Spayne</HI> for them; be&s;ides, I have good rea&s;on to beleeve the hearts, pur&s;es, heads and books of accounts of many Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> will be all ready to as&s;i&s;t the Dutch-Merchants to cozen the <HI>State</HI> of this Trea&s;ure; and truly my humble o|pinion is, that if any publike mini&s;ters can by their policy get all this &s;ilver out of the <HI>Parliaments</HI> hands, that then they will bee extraordinarily rewarded by them of <HI>Holland</HI> for &s;alvage of this Trea&s;ure, it will be beyond Commi&s;sion, money or factoridge.</P>
<P>And as the conjuncture of time &s;tands between us and the Dutch this pre&s;ent moneth of December, &s;ome publique Mini&s;ters in <HI>England</HI> will have the profitable&s;t employment of any Amba&s;&s;ador in the World, if they can chri&s;ten all Hollanders goods and Trea&s;ure with the name of Antwerpians, O&s;tenders and Dunkirkers; or by his or their power can make all goods laden in Hamburgers or Hance townes, that tho&s;e goods mu&s;t of nece&s;sity belong to <HI>Hamborough,</HI> when I have certaine profe to ju&s;tifie the contrary, and I humbly de&s;ire, before the &s;hips be di&s;charged, my witne&s;&s;es may be all examined, and upon the perill of my life I will prove that in the&s;e &s;hips there are great quantities of &s;ilver for the Accompt of
<PB N="7" REF="5"> Hollanders, and people of the united Provinces.</P>
<P>I having formerly beene privy to the proceedings of Merchants that have tran&s;ported gold and &s;ilver out of this Nation, and al&s;o acquainted with &s;everal Merchants that have yeerely imported &s;ilver from <HI>Spayne,</HI> I thought it my duty to acquaint you, that if the <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>State</HI> be not very vigilant in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; and of the proceedings about the &s;ilver, they will be cozened of their right, for there will be no &s;tone left unturned both by the Mer|chants beyond Seas and here, to circumvent the <HI>State</HI> of this Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This that I &s;ay, I &s;peake not out of ill will to the Hollander, for there are &s;everal of the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>State</HI> did me the honor to aske me what I thought of a Peace or Warre; I ever, with all humilitie, told tho&s;e that asked mee; that there could never come a more &s;afe nor honorable thing to the <HI>State,</HI> then to conclude a &s;afe and honorable Peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> yet though I loved them very well while wee had Peace, I re&s;pect them not now during the time of Warre, after &s;uch a rate that they by craft &s;hould co|zen the <HI>State</HI> of this great Trea&s;ure, which is now taken, if to the uttermo&s;t of my power I could hin|der it, or ad any thing to the &s;top of it; and knowing what great mi&s;chiefs would come to this Nation, if I did not make your Honors acquainted with the&s;e practi&s;es; I thinke I am bound, as any Engli&s;h-man, not to feare the face of any, though I know it will get mee ill will, and a &s;hrewd turne, even with &s;om great ones in power; this &s;ervice &s;hall beare me re|cord how faithfully I ever loved and doe love my Countrey, and convince all tho&s;e that have mi&s;re|pre&s;ented mee to the <HI>State,</HI> that after &s;o long oppre&s;|&s;ion I may have my E&s;tate re&s;tored; and this is the true rea&s;on wherfore I humbly pre&s;ent this Paper to your Honor, <HI>vizt.</HI></P>

<P>My Lord, when the King of <HI>Spaynes</HI> fleete returns to &s;aint <HI>Lucar,</HI> there lies out alwaies beyond the bar of &s;aint <HI>Lucar,</HI> which is out of the command of the Ca&s;tle, &s;everal &s;hips of all Nations, and the&s;e lie there purpo&s;ely to take in &s;ilver and gold, coucheneele, and all other <HI>India</HI> commodities &s;o &s;tolne aboard, which &s;ome yeeres there hath beene impo&s;ed above twenty in the hundred for Re|gi&s;tring.</P>
<P>The&s;e goods being &s;hipped, as afore&s;aid, then the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip that takes them in, u&s;ually &s;ignes three Bills, be&s;ide the Regi&s;ter of his owne bookes, which in time of Warre are many; and every Cap|taine, Ma&s;ter or Pur&s;er mu&s;t keepe and carry with him one, to enter all parcels and accounts: One bill of the&s;e three the Merchant u&s;ually &s;ends along with the &s;hip, with a letter of advice to the Merchant, what he hath &s;ent him, the markes and weight, or number of Ingots, or peeces of eight, and the marks and number of all bails, fardels, che&s;ts or caske: Another of the&s;e bills is &s;ent over land u&s;ually by the Po&s;t, with letters of advice of &s;uch goods, gold and &s;ilver, and tho&s;e bills a &s;hipboard they alter accor|ding to the cour&s;e they are to &s;teere; if it be through the chanell of one two or three enemies, they will &s;hew &s;everall bills of lading and bookes of entries, but tho&s;e bills that goe by land are alwaies the true bills, the other bills in the&s;e times are u&s;ually amu&s;e|ments to defraude the <HI>State,</HI> but u&s;ually tho&s;e that come by the Po&s;t are the true bills, but for tho&s;e on &s;hip-board u&s;ually the Merchants know a moneth &s;ooner then the &s;hips coming by Sea, what gold and &s;ilver or comodities his Factor hath &s;hipped, and in what &s;hips, and gives order accordingly at <HI>Dover,</HI> or other Ports in this Nation, for &s;ending his goods to &s;everall places beyond Sea, or to <HI>London,</HI> according as advice &s;hall be given him, where the be&s;t market

<P>That the State would be plea&s;ed to de&s;ire any publique Agents that lay claim, to &s;hew the originall Warrants (for &s;ending away this &s;ilver from <HI>Spain,</HI> either at <HI>Cales</HI> or S. <HI>Lucars,</HI> or other Ports) bills of lading or his originall Letters, &s;uch as he or they will &s;tand upon his or their honor are the true originalls out of <HI>Spain,</HI> taken at Saint <HI>Lucar</HI> or <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and that exact copies may be taken by the Admiralty, and this to be done forthwith, and that they put in all their claims they make to any Goods, gold or &s;ilver in the&s;e &s;hips very &s;odainly, upon their honor to be ju&s;t and true claims without any guile or fraud.</P>
<P>That the State will be plea&s;ed to take order, that the Admirallty &s;trictly examine all the chief Factors and Mariners of the&s;e &s;hips, what Country men they are? where there aboad is? whether they doe not goe by fal&s;e names? and to give a ju&s;t an&s;wer at their perill; and which of them belongs to <HI>Holland?</HI> and whether they have made any Bills of Lading fal&s;ly at Sea, or in the <HI>Downs,</HI> or &s;ince they came into <HI>England</HI> and antedated the &s;ame? if done, by who&s;e advice? and who were privy unto it? or have defa|ced or torn leaves out of their books of Invoyces? or altered their Bills or Books &s;ince they came from <HI>Spain?</HI> and who were pre&s;ent at the doing thereof?</P>
<P>That they give you an accompt where each of them lye, and at who&s;e hou&s;e in Saint <HI>Katherines,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, what Merchants in <HI>London</HI> they know, or have communication with? and who are their Fa|ctors? and &s;et down their names, where each parti|cular man dwells.</P>

<P>My humble &s;uit to your Lord&s;hip is, that the <HI>Coun|cel</HI> of <HI>State</HI> would be plea&s;ed to u&s;e all the expedition they can in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and to &s;ettle &s;ome &s;trict order in it, for if they give the Merchants time to &s;end to <HI>Spayne,</HI> the Merchants will there have what things regi&s;tred, and upon who&s;e accompt they plea&s;e; and &s;eeing that here they cannot have one penny, if that we prove the &s;ilver and commodities belong to <HI>Holland,</HI> they are and will be con&s;trained to goe to <HI>Spayne,</HI> and there, though it be a confi&s;ca|tion to &s;end away &s;ilver before it be Regi&s;tred, with|out the Kings Licence, yet the great Officers and State&s;men to have a good &s;hare, in all probability will get the Kings pardon, and to give what Certifi|cats &s;hall bee de&s;ired, as they have formerly done in <HI>Otho Georges</HI> ca&s;e (provided the Dutch will pay well for it.) To prevent which, there is nothing but expedition, before they have learned their le&s;&s;on from <HI>Spayne;</HI> if the&s;e Merchants which claime this &s;ilver would &s;peake truth, they know almo&s;t all this Silver is for the accompt of <HI>Am&s;terdam, Dort,</HI> and <HI>Netherland</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="7"> merchant. <HI>My Lord, if the</HI> State <HI>in the examination of the&s;e particulars will command my &s;ervice in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, by Gods a&s;si&s;tance I &s;hall give you a good Accompt, I &s;hall with all readines attend it faithfully, &amp; to the uttermo&s;t of my power doe my duty; for to have this plot di&s;covered highly concernes the</HI> Commonwealth; <HI>I have beene privie to their &s;ecret pra|cti&s;es of tran&s;porting of Trea&s;ure to all parts of Chri&s;tendome, out of this Nation, therfore may know the way to unravell this &s;ecret combination &s;ooner then others; for I am a&s;&s;ured no man in this Nation hath had the oportunitie to know the&s;e waies as I doe, for I was imployed in the&s;e di&s;coveries, by the late King and his Councell many yeeres; and my Lord, an old Deere-&s;tealer is the be&s;t Keeper of a Parke.</HI></P>

<P>SIR, the Bullion, Money and Merchandize at pre&s;ent under que&s;tion in the &s;hips <HI>Samp&s;on, Salvador</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> depending in the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> is of &s;o great and con&s;iderable a value, and of &s;o high concernment in pre&s;ident, and other relation to the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> and mo&s;t of it &s;o probable to prove lawfull prize, if timely and duly pro&s;ecuted, and the
<PB N="14" REF="9"> pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;aid &s;hips, and other witne&s;&s;es I have pre&s;ented to Ma&s;ter <HI>Bud</HI> to be examined; it be|hoves the <HI>State,</HI> as I humbly conceive, not to &s;uffer the&s;e &s;hips to pa&s;&s;e, as many &s;hips of great value &s;ince the warre with the Netherlands have done, to the un&s;peakable dammage of this Nation, it being no new thing for the Hollanders, in time of warre, to &s;aile under the colours and names, and with the cockets of <HI>Hamborough,</HI> or &s;ome other of the <HI>Han&s;e-townes,</HI> for they did it all the while they had warres with <HI>Spayne,</HI> nor for the &s;hips of the <HI>Hance-townes, O&s;tenders</HI> and <HI>Dunkirkers</HI> to bee tran&s;porters of Dutch goods through our Seas, from and to all parts of Chri&s;tendome, e&s;pecially <HI>Spayne.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, many times, the better to countenance, their &s;hip or &s;hips &s;hall be built in <HI>Holland,</HI> and formerly &s;old to &s;ome friend or corre&s;pondent in <HI>Hamborough, Emden, Lubeck, Dunkirk, O&s;tend,</HI> or the like, and for the better colour called the <HI>Lion</HI> or <HI>Dove,</HI> &amp;c. of &s;om of the afore&s;aid places; when really and actually it belongs to <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Zealand,</HI> and for in&s;tance whereof one of the &s;hips now in que&s;tion, &s;tiles it &s;elf by the name of the <HI>Hamborough</HI> of <HI>Hamborough,</HI> and is certainly known and will be proved to belong to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and &s;o no que&s;tion will many more of the &s;hips under are&s;t prove to belong to &s;ome towne of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the united Provinces, when &s;trictly and duly examined.</P>
<P>Nor is it any new practi&s;e for publique Mini&s;trs of other States to make u&s;e of their function and Ma|&s;ters Roabe, to befriend the &s;ubject of their Allies, in ca&s;e of the like nature of clayming Trea&s;ure and Merchandize, wherein the native trade (as in this) may be concerned, or were it not but for the advan|tage of &s;alvage in &s;uch ca&s;es conived at, and many times by the in&s;tructions of their &s;uperiors allowed to publique mini&s;ters, as perqui&s;ites of their imploy|ments
<PB N="15" REF="9"> they many times gaining more by &s;uch ave|nies, then by their con&s;tant &s;alaries.</P>
<P>I have often heard &s;ir <HI>Lewis Dives</HI> &s;ay, that when he lived in <HI>Spayne</HI> with his father in law, the earle of <HI>Bri&s;toll,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> they did doe the &s;ame for the Dutch in <HI>Spayne</HI> as is now offered for the Dutch in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And I beleeve there are &s;ome forraigne Princes a|gents in <HI>England</HI> at this time, that under&s;tand to make their particular profit, in this conjuncture of time, as well, if not better, then eyther the earle of <HI>Bri&s;toll,</HI> or the lord <HI>Cottington</HI> did in <HI>Spayne;</HI> and upon this ground and for this end, it is more then probable that &s;ome publique agents appeare in this pre&s;ent que&s;tion in the <HI>Admiralty;</HI> not that eyther their Ma|&s;ter or his &s;ubjects, in all likelyhood, are otherwi&s;e concerned, nor he or they warranted therein, but on|ly for their particular profit.</P>
<P>Sir, this is not a common cau&s;e, and I &s;ee you take it &s;o by your care, you keepe your word, you bid me find proofe and you will hold the &s;hips and &s;ilver, let &s;ome of the Judges talke what they plea&s;e, you will di&s;charge your tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir, the &s;tate of <HI>Spayne</HI> is rarely known to have &s;ent or tran&s;ported any bars of &s;ilver, or coyne on their owne or other &s;hips what&s;oever, to the preju|dice of their Mint, that being mo&s;t ab&s;olute contrary to their lawes, which makes tran&s;porting money death, without the Kings originall Licence; had the Merchants one, they would have &s;hewed it before now. True, it is often &s;toln away by the Dutch, which is done without the Kings warrant, bills of &s;tore, or publique allowance, and &s;o you will finde this is, and thereby the more lyable to que&s;tion, and upon &s;trict examination it will be cleerely proved prize: if the Dutch &s;hould cozen us of this money now they are ranting in the <HI>Downes,</HI> the
<PB N="16" REF="10"> <HI>Commonwealth</HI> would &s;uffer extraordinarily.</P>
<P>Therefore all per&s;ons that claime this &s;ilver, I hum|bly conceive, ought to be pre&s;t to declare &s;pecially and particularly, whether he or they pretend the money, or bullion, or any part of it to be the King of <HI>Spaynes</HI> peculiar Trea&s;ure, or his &s;ubjects? and if &s;o, he or they ought to &s;hew &s;ome &s;peciall and au|thentique Warrant or Order of his or their Ma&s;ters or Officers for it, Regi&s;tred in the ports of <HI>Spayne,</HI> and al&s;o to prove that by authentique witne&s;&s;es, by &s;ome of his Ma&s;ters &s;ubjects, at the place or Port of S. <HI>Lu|car</HI> or <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and atte&s;ted here by like originall bills from the officers of the Cu&s;tomes in <HI>Spayne,</HI> which bills of lading corre&s;pondent, and their authentique duplicats, with letters of con&s;ignement &s;uteable, the Pur&s;ers bookes of entries, with all the particular and re&s;pective marks agreeing with the bills of lading, bills of &s;tore and letters of con&s;ignement, and all the markes of the bars and bags duly Regi&s;tred, either for the King of <HI>Spayne,</HI> or his particular &s;ubjects. If they cannot &s;pell and &s;peake all this perfectly, ju&s;t|ly and truly, at the Port of &s;aint <HI>Lucar</HI> or <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they may faile of their ends for all their confident clay|ming, and the like might every Merchant pretender doe, or fail of his.</P>
<P>Nor can the Articles (of the old League) &s;uppo|&s;ing it to be renued and confirmed by this <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> excu&s;e the &s;hips <HI>Samp&s;on, Salvador</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> under que&s;tion, from a &s;earch, as is pretended they ought to be, unle&s;&s;e they fir&s;t prove, that tho&s;e &s;hips, &s;ilver, and all the lading doe really belong unto his Ma&s;ter or &s;ome of his &s;ubjects (nor tho&s;e of the Ne|therlands) which I humbly &s;ay, he or they will never be able to doe, and I have &s;ufficient proof to the con|trary, if I can but get my witne&s;&s;es examined: I have about eight witne&s;&s;es to examine; and the Mer|chants will pack many of them away now they hear
<PB N="17" REF="10"> I have u&s;ed to &s;end &s;om of my Intelligencers among&s;t them into St. <HI>Katherines</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>In the mean time, if either his Ma&s;ter or his &s;ub|jects receive damage by any publique mini&s;ters claiming &s;ilver which is none of theirs, but belongs to <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Commonwealth</HI> is excu&s;ed and free, and the publique mini&s;ter mu&s;t bear the blame, if any, u&s;ing his Ma&s;ter or his Subjects title to the &s;ilver, when they had no title or intere&s;t therein, w^c^h if that de&s;igne had taken effect, all men may &s;ee the damage that would acrue to this Nation thereby, what&s;oever may be pretended to the contrary.</P>
<P>Sir, The law takes no notice of Words; but legall proof and evidence where a publique mini&s;ter bears Parol again&s;t the intere&s;t of the <HI>Commonwealth</HI> a|mounts to no more then a private mans: for when a claim is laid to all this &s;ilver by forraign Agents, as the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and his Subjects &s;ilver, I &s;hall prove part of this &s;ilver belongs to &s;ome Merchants of the united Provinces, our mortall enemies, and a &s;mall part of this &s;ilver belongs to &s;ome Merchants in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, If I finde a man tripping for a penny, I will trace him for a pound; I fear not to &s;peak a truth in this particular, it is for the &s;afety and well being of the Nation that makes me &s;peak &s;o earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>Sir, though in Court and matters of State, publique mini&s;ters be allowed a Credence paramount, agree|able to their letters Credentiall of forraign Princes; yet neither tho&s;e Letters nor their Function &s;hall, I humbly conceive, allow them any, neither the le&s;t priviledge or preheminence (beyond civility) in any Court of Ju&s;tice again&s;t the Common-wealths title in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the afore&s;aid Prizes and &s;ilver.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Spanyards are as rarely found to trade out of their own Territories, all writers &s;ay (or between) upon Strangers bottoms as their King him&s;elf, and &s;o
<PB N="18" REF="11"> the goods not likely to have beene theirs originally, or by originall con&s;ignment; colourably perhaps they may, that is &s;ince their &s;eizure con&s;igned to &s;om of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> to defeate the claime of this <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> they being commonly partners with the Am&s;terdam|mers, that being u&s;uall in ca&s;es of the like nature, e|&s;pecially where &s;o much re&s;pite of time hath beene given, and &s;o much money &s;tolne out of the&s;e &s;hips, which &s;hall in all likelyhood be imployed to bribe out of the States hands the&s;e &s;hips, if they can fa&s;ten on any, in power, that will be &s;o wicked to receive bribes, if my humble advice had beene followed, the &s;tealing this &s;ilver had beene prevented.</P>
<P N="2">2. The like a&s;&s;uredly may be affirmed touching the money bullion and plate in the &s;hips in que&s;tion &s;ince the naturall &s;ubjects of <HI>Spayne</HI> dare as ill, or wor&s;e, tran&s;port any &s;ilver, as &s;trangers, the crime being alike penall to both, but the &s;ubject in a wor&s;e condition, if he adventure, being a man of e|&s;tate, becau&s;e he remaines in the Countrey, when the &s;tranger perhaps never returnes to an&s;were it, if di&s;covered; after he is out of the Countrey, as upon publication of this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e many will not dare to returne into <HI>Spayne,</HI> le&s;t they forfeit not only their own particular, and their friends e&s;tates, but al&s;o their lives.</P>
<P>But Sir, &s;uppo&s;e it may bee objected, that ge|nerall negatives, from never &s;o many in|&s;tances, of never &s;o univer&s;all <HI>non uzans,</HI> a|mounts not to the face of one particular affirmative profe <HI>in contra;</HI> yet it cannot be denied for rea&s;on, and &s;o I humbly conceive, ought to be granted, that &s;om &s;uch di&s;tinct, particular and &s;igni&s;icant proofe in a cau&s;e of this high nature and concernment to the pro|fit and &s;afety of this <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> ought fir&s;t to bee made of the lading of this &s;ilver, and that from the originall Port of <HI>Cadiz</HI> or <HI>S.

<P>Sir, truly if at the fir&s;t tho&s;e publique Mini&s;ters that claimed had produced originall Warrants from the King of <HI>Spayne,</HI> the atte&s;tation of the Ports of <HI>Ca|diz</HI> and S. <HI>Lucar</HI> from the Duanas there, by authen|tique witne&s;&s;es, that this &s;ilver was &s;hipped for the King of <HI>Spayne</HI> or his &s;ubjects proper accompt, and that all that was claimed was really true, and made that the ground of their exceptions again&s;t the pro|ceedings of the judicature of the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> &amp; therein had appealed to the <HI>Councel</HI> of <HI>State</HI> or <HI>Parliament,</HI> my humble opinion is, that perhaps their demands might have arived at a fairer i&s;&s;ue then now they may have rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>And (by Gods a&s;si&s;tance) they &s;hall have a quick and a vigilant eye on them; for night and day, I and my In&s;truments &s;hall watch them, &s;o that &s;om mer|chants and others may live to wi&s;h they never had medled in this &s;ilver bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and this I will pro&s;e|cute according to my Order faithfully, though it co&s;t me all that ever I have in the world; I know I have ventred my life in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and I will not pluck back my hand let my hazard be what it will.</P>

<P>May it plea&s;e your honors, if I had &s;eene the Bills of lading and bookes of Entries, and all other Pa|pers, according to doctor <HI>Walkers</HI> direction, I had &s;topped many a &s;hip that hath beene di&s;charged, but that would have hindred &s;ome Proctors of their fees, for I am credibly informed, it is ordinary for the Proctors to put downe in their Bills, be&s;ides ordina|ry charges, 40. l. 50. l. and 100. l. upon the clee|ring

<P>When I went to &s;ee your Prize-&s;hips, between <HI>Lon|don &amp; Wollage,</HI> there went with me to &s;ee in what con|dition they were in, Mr. <HI>Paul Smith,</HI> Cap. <HI>Brock,</HI> Mr. <HI>Long</HI> and his two &s;onns, all three Ship-Carpenters; and wee looking both on the in&s;ide and out&s;ide of the Duch prize-&s;hips, we found many of them rent and torn, which by the Law, if they fought in the channel of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the States &s;hips, they are prize; and for this I refer my &s;elf to Ma&s;ter <HI>Reylye</HI>'s Records in the Tower; and thereupon I made my appeal in Court, in the behalf of the Common-wealth,
<PB N="44" REF="24"> and have a great many pre&s;idents out of the Records in the Tower, upon the like ca&s;e it hath been done by others, to which Records I humbly refer my &s;elf.

And finding your Court of Admiralty would di&s;charge many of the&s;e prize-&s;hips, I appealed in the behalf of the Common-wealth, and craved re&s;pit of Judgement till my witne&s;&s;es were examined: The like I did for the &s;ilver &s;hips <HI>Samp&s;on, Salvador</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> and all the thirteen &s;hips which I was aboard on by order and intreaty of the Commi&s;sioners for Duch Prizes the 14 <HI>December</HI> 1652.

<P>I have delivered to the Council of State, and to my Lord <HI>Brad&s;haw,</HI> and <HI>Doctor Walker,</HI> &s;everal papers with all my witne&s;&s;es, beeing the greate&s;t merchants in this Na|tion, and &s;everal per&s;ons aboard the &s;hips, and by their clear te&s;timonie, by God's a&s;si&s;tance I will do the work, which I am as &s;ure the State will carry by my papers, as I am &s;ure I now write to you, if that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hey plea&s; but to proceed effectually in the bu&s;ine&s;s, even by the &s;trict rules of the Civil Law, and not give away their right, as there are &s;om great ones would have them to do, and without my papers and witne&s;s they could never have don it. I finde that <HI>Bud</HI> the Proctor had not in the Court of Admiraltie M^r <HI>Calandrin's</HI> letter tran&s;lated, and &s;o beeing in high Dutch Doctor <HI>Walker</HI> could not make any u&s;e of it at that pre&s;ent; and about a week ago I found <HI>Bud</HI> and <HI>Roe</HI> the proctor and &s;olicitor of the Com|mon-wealth a fea&s;ting together with &s;om forrein A|gents; I have made my Lord <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI> acquainted with it: if <HI>Bud</HI> had don &s;o much in the State of <HI>Venice</HI> I know hee would have lo&s;t his head, now at this time, hee ha|ving all the States writings in his hands and knowing all the &s;ecrets of this great bu&s;ine&s;s. But, by God's a&s;si&s;t|ance I will prevent him in his de&s;igns, or any other that goeth about to di&s;charge the &s;ilver. There are many great heads and hands a working to co&s;en the State upon craftie &s;lie pretences. I finde the learned Doctor <HI>Walker</HI> hath &s;erved the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> in this great bu&s;ine&s;s with much integrity and care and learning, and a great deal of pains (as much as a man could po&s;sible do.) And would I could &s;ay &s;o of &s;om others imployed in this bu&s;ines: the truth is &s;om men in power juggle and they have a great temptation for it by the <HI>Parlaments</HI> not ta|king order to land the &s;ilver in &s;ecure hands, the which is now aboard the prize &s;hips, the Merchants by their
<PB N="57" REF="29"> in&s;truments have &s;tollen a&s;hore many a &s;core of thou&s;and pounds; a great part is brought into the mint &s;ince Chri&s;tmas: and all that will bee found out, if the Gold|&s;miths were &s;trictly examined who they bought this &s;ilver of. Truly there hath lately little, or no &s;ilver bin brought into the mint, but what hath been &s;tollen out of the&s;e prize-&s;hips and the pretenders to this &s;ilver and pri|zes having got &s;uch a va&s;t &s;um of mony to &s;catter, with|out the State keep a &s;trict eye, it will blinde a great ma|ny, I &s;ee it too apparently: and if this bu&s;ine&s;s have not a powerful hand over it, to prevent &s;uch abu&s;es as have been formerly practi&s;ed, I know in what conditi|on the States prizes will bee in.</P>
<P>Sir! I delivered my Lord <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI> in December la&s;t my papers concerning this great bu&s;ine&s;s upon his faith|ful promi&s;s that I &s;hould bee ju&s;tly dealt withal about my e&s;tate, and that be&s;ides I &s;hould receiv a good Reward for this Service.

<P>It griev's mee much to &s;ee &s;om Merchants &s;o de&s;pe|rately mad again&s;t mee for di&s;covering this bu&s;ine&s;s, and at <HI>White Hall</HI> &s;om of the Council think's not of the greatne&s;s of the &s;ervice and my va&s;t charge and hazzard I run.

Truly what they &s;ay in this particular is true; for nothing yet was ever produced in the Court of Admiraltie about this &s;ilver but what my witne&s;&s;es I gave in to Doct. <HI>Walk|er</HI> have, or could have &s;poke unto: for from &s;everal at <HI>Dover</HI> I had notice of the State's Letter to <HI>Dewittee</HI> his Commi&s;sion to convoy all <HI>Hambergers</HI> and <HI>Lubeckers,</HI> and to guard them from the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> becau&s; the&s;e <HI>Hambergers,</HI>

<P>_I Have pre&s;umed to pre&s;ent you with this petition, and papers: and my humble de&s;ire unto you is, that you would do mee right and ju&s;tice. I was required by &s;om of the Council to pre&s;ent my de&s;ires to your Honors about my E&s;tate: for they conceiv it is all the rea&s;on in the world I &s;hould have my E&s;tate, or the ful value of it.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee by my particulars, I have had <HI>eleven thou&s;and pounds</HI> taken from mee undulie, and contra|rie to the law: and though I have ever &s;ince my com|ing out of the tower, had a petition in Parlament to have relief, I could never as yet have right. I have by all waies and means &s;tudied night and daie to pre&s;ent my &s;elf to the world that I was ever in all my actions loial to the intere&s;t of Parlament: in pur&s;uance of that, I have don the Parlament many eminent and faithful &s;ervices, as is well known to all the Commi&s;sioners of the Council of Trade, the Committee of the Mint, and many members of Parlament and Council of State: and now in <HI>December</HI> la&s;t I &s;taied the Silver-&s;hips and many other prize-&s;hips at my va&s;t and great expence. For my doing this bu&s;ine&s;s for the Common-wealth I have at once lo&s;t many friends among&s;t the Merchants and o|thers, &s;pent great &s;ums of monie, and in hazard of my life. If this bee not &s;ufficient te&s;timonie to re&s;tore mee to my E&s;tate, and to have a good Reward, I &s;hall humbly leav it to the con&s;ideration of your Lord&s;hip and all good men. I have in print but given the world a little hint, how your bu&s;ine&s;ses in the Admiraltie have been and are mannaged, and &s;o for the Mint; but if the State knew throughly how things &s;tand in their Admiraltie-Court, and how their trea&s;ure at <HI>Gold-&s;mith's-Hall,
<PB N="60" REF="31"> Worce&s;ter-Hou&s;,</HI> their Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;e, and Mint-bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es have been managed and is to this daie, they would &s;ay it were time to look about them.</P>
<P>The truth of it is, had I been imployed, and impow|red ever &s;ince the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t 1652</HI> to have looked after all the prize-&s;hips and had had a mo|derate allowance for my intelligence, I would have &s;a|ved a great many hundred thou&s;and pounds, that you have let gon out of your hands, (and is at this daie in <HI>Holland)</HI> whereby this Nation hath been unexpre&s;sably abu&s;ed, which without God's mercie will prove fatal.</P>
<P>May it plea&s; your Honors! Let the hazard, envie, and blame bee never &s;o great: nay though it co&s;t mee my life and all I had in the world, I would di&s;cover unto your Honors the de&s;ign that was laid to cozen the the State of the &s;ilver in the prize-&s;hips.</P>
<P>For doing this &s;ervice in &s;taying the &s;ilver I have found ju&s;t what I expected to the ful: for many of the Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> Officers of the Admiraltie, and &s;om others &s;pout reviling words at mee, as a whale doth wa|ter, and &s;om of them have not &s;crupled to threaten my life: and they are skilful at it both by poi&s;on, or poni|ard: they are people that have lived in Countries, where for a little piece of monie &s;uch things are u&s;ually don.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t humbly confe&s;s were I not &s;atisfied in my con&s;cience, that there was a nece&s;sitie by God's provi|dence which put mee on to make this di&s;covery, I &s;hould not have don it. For I feel it, I have rai&s;ed again&s;t mee by doing it many hundred enemies.</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Honors! I have &s;poken with di|vers of the Councill of State; and they wi&s;hed mee to put in my humble propo&s;itions, and therefore I mo&s;t humbly pre&s;ent them to your Honors, humbly de&s;iring your Honors advice, and a&s;si&s;tance in this weightie bu&s;ine&s;s that I might bee ju&s;tly, and fairly dealt with, a|bout the&s;e Prize-Ships, and the &s;ilver in them.</P>

<P>My mo&s;t humble &s;uit to the Council of State is, that out of all the&s;e Ships that I made a Prote&s;t again&s;t their delivery, in the Court of Admiraltie, and out of the &s;hips <HI>Sam&s;on, Salvador,</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> I may, in reward for my di&s;coverie and charge of intelligence reciev all my E&s;tate which hath been taken from mee to the value of the &s;um of <HI>eleven thou&s;and pounds;</HI> which is but ju&s;t my own monies, which I have had for ten years unduly kept from mee, as appear's by the particulars hereafter following.</P>
<P>With this my humble Petition I have made &s;everal Members of Parlament, and of the Council acquainted; and they hold, that I de&s;erv a farr greater Reward for doing this &s;ervice: for here I do the State the greate&s;t &s;ervice that ever was don in <HI>England</HI> by any man of my condition: I bring unto the State neer <HI>four hundred thou&s;and pounds,</HI> at this conjuncture of time, in &s;ilver, of our Enemies monie; which, if it had not been for mee, the State had been cozened of it; I al&s;o di&s;covered a fraud and my&s;terie of &s;om Merchants, which, if it had continued, would have endangered a ruin of this Na|tion.</P>
<P><HI>The Dutch at one time, before I di&s;covered the frauds to the State, did get out of the Parlament's hands Eleven hundred thou|&s;and pounds in &s;ilver, which wee had once in our cu&s;todie &s;ince la&s;t</HI> Augu&s;t, <HI>and now it is all in</HI> Holland. <HI>For this my &s;ervice to the State I have brought on my &s;elf many Enemies; &s;o that now if I &s;hould not have ju&s;t dealing from the State, and my E&s;tate restored, or the value of it, I have by this action for the Common-wealth, made my life bitter, and uncomfortable unto mee every way, and it will for ever di&s;courage any to &s;erv you upon the like occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord! I do the State this &s;ervice, and ask not one pennie, but to have my own again, which hath been un|duly taken from mee, as afore&s;aid, upon fal&s; pretences, and I never get a trial, as is well known unto your Honor. But &s;om of the Members of Parlament when
<PB N="62" REF="32"> I petitioned for a Trial even by Mar&s;hal Law, replied, <HI>if I had been guiltie, I &s;hould never need to have petitioned for a Trial; I &s;hould have had one without petitioning.</HI> A fearful and &s;ad thing, to je&s;t mee out of my whole E|&s;tate; they not remembring the rule, <HI>do as you would bee don to.</HI></P>

I am confident God will never &s;uffer the State to commit &s;uch a &s;in of ingratitude.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay I have convinced the greate&s;t Enemies I have in England by deceiving their expectations, they little thinking THO. VIOLET could or would have don <HI>the Parlament</HI> this &s;ervice, I have heard &s;o much my &s;elf from &s;om of their own mouths; and, I do verily believ, in their own con&s;ciences, between God and them&s;elves, they are convinced, that they have oppre&s;&s;ed mee un|ju&s;tly; and if &s;o, let &s;om Members of the Parlament have a care when they are in judgment, <HI>Not to pronounce a &s;entence again&s;t the light of their own con&s;ciences: for the Oppre&s;&s;ors that willingly do injustice, to plea&s; them&s;elves, or others, that are in power, when their con&s;cience &s;hall check them for Oppre&s;&s;ion, may one day fall under the &s;ame affliction them&s;elves.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1 THat for want of order and a due regulation, and por&s;ecution of the matters of the State's Prizes, and Prizes of private men of War, depending in the Court of Admiraltie, divers great lo&s;&s;es and in|conveniencies have en&s;ued; which, if not prevented for the future, will bring unexpre&s;&s;able mi&s;chief on this Nation, and will not onely di&s;courage all private Men of War, for continuing tho&s;e Ships they have abroad, or &s;ending forth of others; but deprive the Common-wealth of much, if not mo&s;t of that benefit it might and ought to make by Prizes, which are, and have been brought in by the Parlament's Ships; which Prizes ought to bee employ'd towards the &s;upport of this War; by which means this State hath been much di&s;enabled, and our enemies enabled, as by &s;ad experience &s;ince the&s;e Wars began, the State hath found, and by your Petitio|ner it hath been humbly pre&s;ented to your Honors to take &s;uch order that there may bee a timely redre&s;s be|fore it bee too late.</P>
<P N="2">2. That for want of &s;tricter in&s;tructions to all Commanders at Sea for this Common-wealth, manie
<PB N="76" REF="39"> Ships have pa&s;&s;ed unque&s;tion'd, or not fully examined; and manie more are likely to bee permitted to pa&s;s, and never to have judgment in future, and you have had Millions of Trea&s;ure &s;uffered to pa&s;s in this ma|ner; which if it had been &s;topped, had brought the <HI>Hollanders</HI> on their knees before this time. When your Court of Admiraltie and Officers in that Court, are not well regulated, it is a dangerous back-door to this Nation; and by co&s;tly experience, this State upon exa|mination will finde it.</P>
<P N="3">3. That whereas heretofore in the Court of Admiraltie, &s;everal Ships were in que&s;tion, and upon ju&s;t grounds and &s;u&s;pition, were brought in as prize, (but were not put to plead <HI>&s;pecially)</HI> by which means many Ships to the value of manie hundred thou&s;and pounds, &s;ince <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, have avoided Judgment and after-que&s;tion, for want of &s;trict examination, (by which means particular proof might have been in all likelihood found out) the&s;e Prize-Ships have been di&s;charged. It beeing alleged, it is contrarie to the Rules of the Admiraltie; I humbly &s;aie, <HI>No ill cu&s;toms &s;hould bee kept up to endanger the &s;aftie of the Nation;</HI> for the Owners of all &s;uch Prizes, beeing under que|&s;tion, ought, by the Civil Law, to prove their Inte|re&s;t; e&s;pecially, as by your Petitioner's endeavors, and rea&s;ons given to Doctor <HI>Walker,</HI> your Petitioner made it manife&s;t to bee the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of other Nations, and that atte&s;ted by the able&s;t Merchants in <HI>London:</HI> and by the great care of Doctor <HI>Walker,</HI> hee got a Judgment for the Common-wealth, for the <HI>Samp&s;on, George</HI> and <HI>Salvador,</HI> beeing the Ships that have the Silver, to ca&s;t the proof on the Claimers, and to cau&s; them to prove <HI>&s;pecially;</HI> and I humbly hope all other Prizes &s;hall ex&s;pect the like hereafter, for I humbly &s;aie, it is the onely, and quicke&s;t waie to curb the <HI>Hollander's</HI> greatne&s;s, to &s;top them of Trade, in anie Ve&s;&s;els what&s;oever, which will never bee don
<PB N="77" REF="39"> except the State keep a &s;trict eie on the proceedings of the Court of Admiraltie, during the War with <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That the State hath &s;uffered very much, for want of diligent and &s;pecial Pro&s;ecutors or Solicitors, to take e&s;pecial notice of everie Prize, and for attend|ing as <HI>Remembrancer</HI> to the Council of State, and to the State's Coun&s;el at law; to have this don, is the work of many men, and to order all bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;o no Prize &s;hould com into the Court to receiv Judgment, if there were any difficultie, or di&s;pute in the title, till the State's Coun&s;el had argued it <HI>pro,</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> privately; if this cour&s; had formerly been taken, manie a Prize-Ship, which hath been di&s;char|ged the Court of Admiraltie, and is now in <HI>Holland,</HI> had been confi&s;cated to the State,</P>
<P>And therefore to enable your Petitioner, to do you this &s;ervice for the future.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner humbly de&s;ire's, that hee may have a perfect li&s;t, from the Regi&s;ter of the Court of Ad|miraltie, of all the Prizes brought into this Common-wealth, from the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1652. for the u&s;e of the State, and all Prizes brought in by private Men of War, and what Ships were condemn'd, and the daies when, and to whom; and that the State's Commi&s;sioners, for <HI>Dutch</HI> Prize-goods, maie bee de&s;ired to do the &s;ame, that your Petitioner maie &s;ee they agree.</P>
<P>And I humbly &s;aie, until this bee don, that there bee &s;om employ'd to execute that tru&s;t, to mannage and prepare bu&s;ine&s;s, the Common-wealth's Coun|&s;el cannot execute their charge as were to bee wi&s;hed, and ex&s;pected; and it is not an Ordinarie Solicitation to finde out witne&s;&s;es, and the My&s;teries and frauds of Merchants, it mu&s;t bee don by men that have had long experience, and great acquaintance, to get your intelligence; and this part cannot bee acted by the
<PB N="78" REF="40"> State's Coun&s;el: for it is out of their Cour&s;, they mu&s;t have everie thing brought to their hands; neither is it for the Judges of the Admiraltie, to take notice of anie cau&s; further, more than what &s;tand's proved before them in Court.</P>
<P N="5">5. That by rea&s;on of the premi&s;ed wants in the cour&s; of the Admiraltie, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially for want of skil|ful &s;ollicitation, and a due care to &s;ee every one in tru&s;t to do his dutie; there hath been about eightie &s;hips brought in as Dutch-Prizes, and many of them &s;hot and torn; many of them had been let gon without judgment, had it not been for Your Petitioner's prote|&s;ting and appealing in the Court of Admiraltie, which hath been followed at the &s;ole endeavors and great char|ges and expences of Your Petitioner.</P>
<P N="6">6. That for want of &s;tricter Rules in the Admiral|tie, great numbers of Prizes brought in by private men of War have been di&s;charged, to the great di&s;heartning of all Adventurers of that kinde, and weakning the le&s;&s;er; but nece&s;&s;arie &s;inews of this Common-wealth; I humbly &s;aie, it is highly advantagious for the State to improve all the force of particular Adventurers both Merchants and Seamen, and to let them have all encou|ragement as po&s;sible may bee given, for to offend &s;o craftie and potent an enemie; I humbly &s;ay, that di|ver&s; great Merchants complain, that it is in vain for them to put out private men of War again&s;t the Dutch, as things are carried in the Admiraltie; and from good hands I have it, that the Dutch doth give again&s;t this State, all encouragement to their private men of War.</P>
<P>My humble de&s;ire is, that the Regi&s;ter of the Admi|raltie may bee Ordered to give mee the particular of all private Ships di&s;charged &s;ince the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1652, and if I bee commanded, I will a&s;si&s;t and &s;ollicite for to &s;ee to the State's part, that the Ships bee not di&s;char|ged for the future as they have been formerly, through the negligence, if not wor&s;, of your Proctor M^r <HI>Budd,</HI>

<P N="7">7.

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s; your Honor!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to my order I attended this daie in the Court of Admiraltie, to &s;ee what proceeding was about the Prize-Silver which is now in the Tower; tru|ly the carriage and pa&s;&s;ages of &s;om eminent men in the Court was highly prejudicial to the State's intere&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="41"> about the Silver; and I humbly conceiv, your Honors of the Council of State ought to have a particular Ac|count.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you to acquaint the Council, it fall's out concerning this Silver, ju&s;t as I formerly told the late Council of State, that, for want of a &s;trict care of Exa|mining &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es which I had ready to produce, many of them have been packed away by the Mer|chants that claim; and there hath been &s;o many delaies in the proceedings in the Admiraltie, that they beyond Seas have had time to laie their bu&s;ine&s;s, that almo&s;t all the Silver &s;hall bee claimed as belonging to them of <HI>Flanders;</HI> which if diligent and &s;peedie care bee taken, may yet bee prevented, and I &s;hall make them lo&s;e their de&s;ign.</P>
<P><HI>Doctor Walker</HI> did this daie carrie him&s;elf in this bu|&s;ine&s;s with a great deal of zeal and experience for the &s;e|curitie of the State, and made his prote&s;t in the behalf of the Common-wealth.</P>
<P>Sir! The unlading of the Silver is nothing without making out the proof, that it is <HI>Hollanders</HI>'s goods and Silver.</P>
<P>If that &s;om Order bee not taken to give a &s;top to &s;eve|ral per&s;ons, and that &s;uddenly, they will bee all &s;ent away out of this Nation, as I am credibly informed &s;om have been; and the State lo&s;e their Witne&s;&s;es; then the Silver will bee all claimed under the <HI>Spaniard's</HI> title, as now they put in their claims; and for want of a due &s;ollicitation, by knowing men that under&s;tand the &s;e|cret combination and frauds in this kinde, the State will run an hazard to lo&s;e this great Trea&s;ure, onely by the mi&s;carriages of &s;om in the Admiraltie.</P>
<P>I have been acquainted with the&s;e &s;ecrets this 30 years, and there was not a Witne&s;s produced in the Court of Admiraltie, but &s;uch as I delivered to <HI>Doctor Walker;</HI> it will fall &s;o out, all our Engli&s;h Merchants will run a great hazard to have their goods &s;taied beyond Sea, if
<PB N="82" REF="42"> the Silver bee taken away and coyned, without proving it to belong to the Dutch, or the people of the Nether|lands, which I had many Witne&s;&s;es to prove this Silver Prize; therefore great diligence ought to have been given to examine &s;everal Pa&s;&s;engers and Mariners a|board the &s;aid Prize-&s;hips, before they had been &s;hifted away by the Merchants that claim the Silver; which the State may thank M^r <HI>Budde</HI> the Proctor for the Common-wealth, for his neglect, if any inconvenience com on it.</P>
<P>Sir! If I bee commanded and impower'd as I have formerly told you, I will &s;ee a quick and vigorous pro|&s;ecution &s;hall bee had in the Admiraltie for all the for|mer mi&s;carriages, that the&s;e frauds &s;hall bee di&s;covered, and the State entituled to this Trea&s;ure in the <HI>Samp&s;on, Salvador</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> and &s;everal other Prizes, Merchan|dize and Silver.</P>
<P>SIR!

<P>M^R Lievtenant of the Tower did &s;end for mee, to tell mee that I &s;hould com unto you about &s;om bu&s;ine&s;s you had to &s;peak with mee, about the Bullion in the Mint; and when I &s;pake with your Honors, you
<PB N="89" REF="45"> de&s;ired mee to draw up in brief for the be&s;t manage|ment of the Coyning of the Bullion in the Tower; your Honor telling mee, the Council of State had ta|ken &s;pecial notice of my great &s;ervice about the Prize-Silver.</P>
<P>You told mee you had &s;poken with the Ma&s;ter|worker and Comtroller of the Mint, and &s;om other Officers; you found them very raw and ignorant in this bu&s;ine&s;s, all, &s;aving one M^r <HI>James Hore,</HI> and M^r <HI>Burch,</HI> whom you found to bee able Clerks. Seeing your Honors, and M^r Lievtenant of the Tower, have re|que&s;ted mee to give you in writing, what in my expe|rience is to bee don, in carrying on this great work of taking all the marks of the &s;ilver, and keeping a par|ticular account of the &s;everal parcels of Silver, Weights and Marks.</P>
<P N="1">1. Your Honors mu&s;t take a &s;pecial care that every parcel of Silver bee di&s;tinctly weighed, and that no man, but &s;uch as you imploie, &s;ee the marks of the Bars, or Ca&s;es, and that no Silver bee weighed but before one of your Honors, beeing of the Committee of the Council of State, and upon every remove out of the Office the papers of the marks to bee &s;ealed up.</P>
<P N="2">2. When you bring your Parcels, you mu&s;t mark every parcel in Bars, Bags, ca&s;es, and Cask, <HI>viz.</HI> n^o 1, n^o 2, n^o 3, and &s;o forward to the la&s;t number if there bee ten thou&s;and Parcels.</P>
<P N="3">3. When this is don, you mu&s;t make your a&s;&s;aies di&s;tinctly of all Bars, and if there bee any little one, they mu&s;t bee melted into one Bar, and a piece cut to make an a&s;&s;ay; if you finde Plate and ve&s;&s;els of &s;ilver, all that is in one parcel mu&s;t bee melted down, and the finene&s;s, and weight, and mark of the Bags, Ca&s;es, Bar|rels kept di&s;tinctly; when you melt, you mu&s;t weigh your &s;ilver exactly to the pot, and keep an account of the wa&s;t back, and that all the a&s;hes bee &s;aved, and at the end of all bee wa&s;hed, for el&s; there may bee vo|luntarie
<PB N="90" REF="46"> &s;pillings out of the Pots, and &s;o you may bee deceiv'd. You mu&s;t have a care whom you tru&s;t in the Melting-hou&s; while your &s;ilver is melting; for you may have a lay or copper put in, and that &s;hall make it weigh your full weight; but if you imploy M^r <HI>James Hore</HI> in the bu&s;ine&s;s, or M^r <HI>Burch,</HI> they are men that are ve|ry hone&s;t and able, can, and will do it ju&s;tly.</P>
<P N="5">5. If you plea&s;, I offer to melt down the Ingots, af|ter they are all a&s;&s;aied, to deliver unto the Moniers, for the Fee of 12 grains upon every pound weight Troy. whereas S^r <HI>John Wolla&s;ton</HI> hath for this 30 years had 16 grains upon everie pound weight Troy; which Office hee is now uncapable of to execute, by rea&s;on of a late Order from the Cuncil of State, for his late engage|ment in the late black and &s;erpentine Petition with &s;om of the Citie.</P>
<P>I made a Propo&s;ition to the Committee of the Mint, about a year and an half pa&s;t, to execute the place of Ma&s;ter-Worker of the Mint for an hundred pounds the year, and to melt the &s;ilver at 12 grains the pound weight; whereas the Ma&s;ter-Worker allow's S^r <HI>John Wolla&s;ton</HI> 16 grains the pound weight for melting the &s;ilver.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;ition was Ordered to bee reported to the then Council of State by the Committee of the Mint; and I humbly offer to do it for you now at the price of 12 grains the pound weight, and a 100^l^. a year; by which offer I &s;ave the State about fifteen hundred pounds the year, of what the Ma&s;ter-Worker and his man the melter hath allowed them when the Mint goes, in &s;uch quantitie as formerly.</P>
<P>6. Your convenient's and &s;afe&s;t way for your mo|nies after it is coined, is to bag it up in the Mint; and this may bee don for about two &s;hillings the 100^l^. and let it remain in &s;om &s;ecure place in the Mint, or the Tower, and none com unto it, but by Order of the Council of State, by this waie you will &s;ave &s;eve|ral
<PB N="91" REF="46"> Fees that will run out to &s;everal people, if by this way they bee not prevented.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t keep &s;om purpo&s;ely to &s;ee the exact telling the monie; that they keep a perfect account upon Oath, what the Shere make's, and put it down ju&s;tly to the State; by this waie you may &s;ave &s;om thou&s;ands of pounds in Fees; and the State ought to have a ju&s;t ac|count of the profits of the Shere, which amount's u&s;ual|ly to 8^s and &s;omtimes 10^s the 100^l^. by tale.</P>
<P>You al&s;o keep your monie in your own cu&s;todie, under your own lock and keie, to bee di&s;po&s;ed of as the State &s;hall &s;ee good at an hour's warning.</P>
<P>For &s;om other directions concerning the uncapa|blene&s;s of &s;everal of your Officers in the Mint; as the Ma&s;ter-Worker, the Comptroller, the Clerk of the Irons, and &s;om others; your Honors &s;ee what igno|rant men they are; they may bee a&s;hamed to eat the State's bread, and are not capable of any bu&s;ine&s;s: your Honors told mee you were &s;orrie to &s;ee the State &s;o &s;erved in the Mint; the like did the Lievtenant of the Tower.</P>
<P>May it plea&s; your Honors, if by God's Provi|dence I had not &s;taied this &s;ilver, there would none have been coined till the State had gotten more skil|ful Officers in the Mint; and yet the&s;e men, I under|&s;tand, intend to &s;top the arreers of wages they pretend is due to the Ma&s;ter-worker, the Comptrroller, and the Clerk of the Irons, out of the monies and pro|fits ari&s;ing by the coining of this &s;ilver which I cau&s;ed to bee &s;taied, and is now in the Tower; which will bee to the Ma&s;ter-Worker about a thou|&s;and pounds, and to other Officers twice as much; in all, it com's to three thou&s;and pounds, or there|abouts; When the&s;e men have &s;poiled your mint, they are very confident men to make any &s;uch de|mands; I humbly hope the Committee of the Reve|nue will look to prevent any &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s on their accounts for the future, now they know it.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="47">
<P>Truly I have ju&s;tified it before the Committee of the Mint formerly, and afore all the Officers of the Mint, about a year and a half pa&s;t; That the State had better have given fortie thou&s;and pounds for the&s;e la&s;t five years, then have &s;uch Officers as &s;om of the afore&s;aid per&s;ons in the mint; and this I have ju&s;tified before the&s;e Officer's faces, at a Committee of the late Parlament; onely M^r <HI>Hore</HI> and M^r <HI>Burch</HI> under|&s;tand the bu&s;ine&s;s, and are men fit for their emploi|ment, in the Mint, or better places then they have.</P>
<P>If I had the place of Ma&s;ter-Worker of the Mint, as the late King appointed mee, I would know from any part of Chri&s;tendom, what great quantities of &s;ilver is &s;tirring to bee tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>May it plea&s; your Honors! If I had not known by long experience this Art, your Honors at this daie had not had this Trea&s;ure in the Tower.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t humbly offer my &s;ervice to your Honors, and de&s;ire &s;uch an emploiment in the Mint, and &s;uch allowance as your Honors, and the Council of State &s;hall think fitting for the &s;ervice of the State, and I &s;hall accept of it as part of my &s;atisfaction which I humbly petition the State for; thus with the Tender of my humble &s;ervice, I remain</P>

<PB N="95" REF="48"> and profits they maie make other waies, <HI>(and it is &s;uch a</HI> BAITE <HI>profit)</HI> that few men will refu&s;e it, to let it com to them anie waie; I will not po&s;sitively affirm, that it is daily practi&s;ed, till the bu&s;ine&s;s is throughly in&s;pected by a Committee of Parla|ment.</P>
<P>It is this, I am a Commi&s;sioner for &s;ale of all the State's Prize-Goods and Ships, and by my Intere&s;t, I have gotten my Brother to have the charge of all Ware-hou&s;es, and Sellars where the&s;e goods laie. I have all Porters, Packers, Brookers and all other &s;e|veral in&s;truments that are for the buying the State's Goods and Merchandize, com unto my Brother to ta&s;te Wines, and Tobaccos, and to view Corn, Sugars, Oyles, Woolls, Fruit, Spice, Silks, Beads, Linnings, and all other commodities, when I have don, I will cau&s; &s;om people, <HI>viz.</HI> Coopers, Brookers, Por|ters or other skilful per&s;ons in Merchandize, to &s;ort the State's Wines, either <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> Tobaccos, Silks, Linnens, Woolls, Oyles, Fruit, Spice and all o|ther commodities, when this is don, I will make a &s;ale of part of the&s;e commodities, and re&s;erv a quan|titie of the &s;orted and pick'd Merchandize, for my &s;elf, or friend, who is a monied man, and can at a pinch laie down twentie thou&s;and pounds for a bar|gain; paradventure old M^r <HI>Rowland Will&s;on</HI> or &s;om other in the Citie.</P>

The&s;e goods thus &s;orted, gurbled and pick'd from the gro&s;s bulk, maie bee better in the true value then the gro&s;s quantitie of Merchandize, &s;old by the candle unpick'd, &s;om times twentie, thirtie, naie fortie in the hundred, and &s;omtimes where Goods are perri&s;hable half in half, and above.

<P><HI>My An&s;wer is,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THis Narrative is at the pre&s;ent, Printed onely for the information of the Members of Par|lament and Council of State, and the Council of Officers of his Excellencie the Lord General (this pre&s;ent Parlament and Council of State, beeing the onely Judges to give mee relief in my ju&s;t demands) the former Parlament and Council of State for whom I did this &s;ervice beeing now di&s;&s;olved as a Parlament and Council.</P>
<P N="2">2. I mo&s;t humbly conceiv that this pre&s;ent Parla|ment having now in their po&s;&s;e&s;sion, all the Silver I &s;taied in the Court of Admiraltie, and &s;everal other Prize-Ships will bee honorably plea&s;ed to &s;ee mee have my due Reward, which was promi&s;ed mee by the late Council of State, and that is my e&s;tate a|gain re&s;tored unto mee, or &s;o much as can bee by the power of the Parlament, and to make up the re&s;t of my e&s;tate that cannot bee re&s;tored either in money or Offices; the &s;om of <HI>eleven thou&s;and pounds,</HI> according to my particular in this Book <HI>fol. 63.</HI> and this was the agreement and promi&s;s I had from the Committee of Forrein affairs, and others of the Council of State, be&s;ides manie of the Members of Parlament told mee, I de&s;erved a greater Reward
<PB N="100" REF="51"> for this bu&s;ine&s;s, more then to bee re&s;tored to my e&s;tate, for that they were of opinion, if once my cau&s; of Seque&s;tration &s;hould bee heard in the Hou&s;, I would bee cleered of my Seque&s;tration. Truly I humbly &s;aie, were I in any Common-Wealth in Chri&s;tendom, and had don them the like &s;ervice as I have don here, and had nothing to pretend too, but this &s;ervice; I have heard &s;om Travellers &s;aie, I &s;hould for my di&s;coverie of &s;o great a bu&s;ine&s;s, have manie thou&s;and pounds beyond what <HI>I</HI> Petition for as my due. I &s;hould bee injurious to the Ju&s;tice of the Parlament, if I &s;hould make anie declaration as a que&s;tion of re|ceiving my due.</P>
<P N="3">3.

I did them this &s;er|vice for the Common-wealth and not for any parti|cular per&s;on, or for anie particular man's profit in the Council of State, and therefore though the particular per&s;ons bee changed in the Government, the Com|mon-wealth is not changed, the Common-wealth hath the Silver, the Common-wealth in honor is in|gaged to do mee right; the&s;e pre&s;ent Governors, are as Stewards for the Common-wealth, and if my re|ward &s;hould not bee punctually performed by the pre&s;ent Power, it would for ever hereafter bee of dangerous con&s;equence to the State, and would di&s;|courage any to &s;erv the State. I have don the State in this particular, the greate&s;t &s;ervice that ever was don in <HI>England</HI> by anie man of my condition, to &s;ave them neer four hundred thou&s;and pounds in Silver of our enemies, in this conjuncture of time.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Sir!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have here pre&s;ented you a true <HI>Narrative</HI> of &s;om remarkable pa&s;&s;ages, concerning the Silver Prizes, <HI>viz.</HI> the Ships, <HI>Sam|p&s;on, Salvador,</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> and &s;everal Prizes depending in the High-Court of Admiraltie, with &s;om prime ob&s;ervations of the Trade of this Nation, and for regulating the Mint in the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Sir! There are &s;om men, when they behold a hou&s; ready fini&s;hed, they do not at the fir&s;t apprehend the &s;e|veral pins, and beams, and materials that make's and frame's the building; there is many a nail driven, which the Spectator never &s;ee's; the builder that paie's for it, hee onely keep's that particular account, as I have don for this Book, Humbly pre&s;ent you.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> mu&s;t confe&s;s, this is but a thatched Cottage, but it hath co&s;t mee many years pains and trouble, and great expence, to pre&s;ent it to you, in that ruff, and unpolli&s;h|ed &s;hape it is in; I have for many years night and daie, had &s;everal helps and hands, both in <HI>England</HI> and beyond-Seas, from choice intelligencers, and out of &s;everal ma|nu&s;cripts in the cu&s;todie of S^r <HI>John Cook,</HI> when hee was Secretarie to the late King; and &s;ince the Parlament, <HI>I</HI> have got what I could by indu&s;trie, from Merchants and others, both at home and abroad, at my great expence, to make mee &s;erviceable to my Countrie, in &s;tudying the individual pro&s;peritie of every man, that is a true lover of this Common-wealth.</P>
<P>Sir! Hee that travail's far in a Winter's daie, had need to bee up before Sun-ri&s;ing. And &s;uch honorable Mem|bers as your &s;elf, &s;hall and have no doubt found the af|fairs of the Common-wealth, left &s;trangely intangled, the 20. of <HI>April</HI> 1653. The great God of Heaven di|rect you to &s;et all &s;trait in the Common-wealth; and that
<PB N="108" REF="57"> you may amend what you found ami&s;s, to the comfort of this Nation, and to you, and your po&s;terities, ever|la&s;ting honor, whereby this Common-wealth may ble&s;s God for you, and other worthie Members of Parlament, and Armie.</P>
<P>SIR! There is a Rule in the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> when their Emb&s;&s;adors com home, the Senate there requireth them to give an account, of the negotia|tions in Forreign parts, and to declare the conditions, manners, fa&s;hions and powerfull parties and factions in tho&s;e Kingdoms or Common-wealths from whence they return.</P>
<P>An Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Venice</HI> returning from <HI>England,</HI> in the late King <HI>Charles's</HI> time, was, according to cu&s;tom, to give his u&s;ual account in the Senate; hee, after a long Oration of the power of the Spani&s;h, Italian, French, Dutch, and Scotch-intere&s;t in the Court of <HI>England,</HI> their &s;everal influences on all the actions of the late King, and his Coun&s;el, was re|quired to give an account of the power and intere&s;ts the Engli&s;h Natives had them&s;elvs in their own Coun&s;els; to which the Emba&s;&s;ador replied, That the Natives them&s;elvs had little or no power in the Court of <HI>England; for though the King's Privie Council had all Engli&s;h bodies, yet they had Spani&s;h, French, Dutch, and Scotch hearts, and many of them Forreign Prince's Pen|&s;ioners;</HI> and the true lovers of their Countrie, the Na|tives of <HI>England,</HI> had little power in their own Coun|&s;els; the late King having a re&s;olution to ca&s;t off all Parlaments, and to rule by his own Prerogative.</P>
<P>The &s;ad effects of tho&s;e Coun&s;els, and thir mi&s;|carriages, brought the late great mi&s;eries and Wars on this Nation.</P>
<P>May it plea&s; you Sir! I would to God &s;om men could not ju&s;tly &s;ay the like, during &s;om time of the late Parlament: many of their Coun&s;ellors and Mem|bers in the begining of the late Parlament &s;peaking
<PB N="109" REF="57"> all perfit Scotch and Presbyterie; and afterwards &s;om of their late Coun&s;ellors perfect Spani&s;h, Dutch and French. SIR! I &s;ay I have found this a &s;ad truth, ten thou&s;and pounds deep and better, to my particu|lar e&s;tate.</P>
<P>SIR! let mee mo&s;t humbly entreat you to bee in|&s;trumental, with all the worthie Members of this pre&s;ent Parlament, to remember they are Engli&s;h, and to act upon true Engli&s;h principles, e&s;teeming the good of the Nation above all private re&s;pects; and their faith and word once pa&s;t, is ever to bee kept, either with particular men or States.</P>
<P>There was many Noble Gentlemen of the la&s;t Parlament labored it, and &s;tudied to bring it about; but they were over-powred by &s;everal parties, and divi&s;ions even among&s;t them&s;elvs; if there bee any that hinder this good work in your Coun&s;els, I pray God to di&s;cover him, and to amend and convert him or bring him to Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>That which I mo&s;t humbly de&s;ire, is, for every man perfectly and freely (with due reverence I hum|bly &s;ay it to the Supreme Autoritie) to &s;peak his Countrie's language, perfect Engli&s;h in all their words and actions; to bee publick &s;pirited men; that is, to &s;tudie the ju&s;t peace, wealth, pro&s;peritie and hap|pine&s;s of every individual member of this Nation; and that they &s;tudie the re&s;toring of Trade, the ere|cting of Manufactures, the &s;etting all the poor on work, to the relieving the aged and impotent, even &s;uch as have been &s;truck by God's hand, or for their Countrie's defence.</P>
<P>My mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;uit to you, is, above all earthly things, diligently to prepare Ships, men, and materi|als for to defend your Dominion of the Seas of this Common-wealth; for without this, you, nor any one member in this Nation, can call any thing their
<PB N="110" REF="58"> own, longer then it &s;hall bee lent them by the cour|te&s;ies of our neighbor-Nation.</P>
<P>And what favor upon their prevailing can bee ex&s;pected by us from them, their former courte&s;ies in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and their late actions apparently de|clare to every true Engli&s;h heart.</P>
<P><HI>Upon honorable and ju&s;t conditions, for the good of both Nations, God in his good time I hope and pray for, that hee will finde a way to &s;ave his &s;ervant</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>that is, both</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and</HI> Dutch; <HI>and catch the</HI> Ram <HI>in the Bu&s;h, I mean the</HI> Je&s;uits <HI>that lately kindled this fire, and to this daie blow the coles between both Nations.</HI></P>
<P>Noble SIR! I have in this <HI>Narrative,</HI> &s;hewed you a Watch in pieces, and &s;om of the Wheels and Springs that make's the motion, or el&s; a Carpenter's Rule, the inches and Mathematical lines. Yet noble Sir! I humbly tell you, the &s;hewing a man a Rule and a Watch doth not enable him, without long &s;tudie, tools and materials, to make a Watch, or a Rule.</P>
<P>I humbly &s;aie, I had rather bee a Carpenter by daily practice to know how to build a hou&s;, then a Mathe|matitian by Theorick, which can talk of an hundred things in framing an hou&s;; but give him a Mallet, Saw and Square, hee know's not how to handle one of them.</P>
<P>So it is not the Theorick, but the Practick part that can do this &s;ervice which I have don for the Common-wealth. Sir! <HI>I</HI> humbly &s;aie, there mu&s;t bee Men read, as well as books; and many years &s;tudie to do this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>SIR! I deliver not this paper to erect Offices and Im|ployments upon the recommendations of friends, for any in Power, to make &s;uch u&s;e of the&s;e my humble Propo&s;als, as &s;om of the late Parlament have don. <HI>viz.</HI> To put into great places of tru&s;t, and skill, ignorant and unskilful men, or Rooks; as many of your Trea&s;urers and other Officers have been; that, by indirect waies,
<PB N="111" REF="58"> have cram'd their pur&s;es, and bought incredible va&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;sions.</P>
<P>Their monies and lands they now have, belong's truly to the Common-wealth, and every particular member in this Nation, have been abu&s;ed by their indirect waies.</P>
<P>For in the late Parlament and late Council of State, many things were propounded of excellent u&s;e for the Common-wealth, both by my &s;elf and others; but &s;el|dom any thing took in any other mould, then that &s;uch, and &s;uch Members, their brethren, kindred, or favorites, mu&s;t have the management of all the Publick Trea&s;u|ries, Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e, Prize good, Mint-affairs, and all other places of profit.</P>
<P>And ju&s;tly <HI>I</HI> conceiv they ought to have the prehemi|nence, provided every one of their attempts had been ju&s;t, their allowances moderate, and their whole tran&s;a|ctions fairly and truly carried, without fraude.</P>
<P>Noble Sir, it will upon &s;trict examination bee found for the&s;e many years, &s;everal publick Officers have not duely accounted for their Receipts of monie, to the Com|mon-wealth, by which abu&s;es of not calling the Trea|&s;urers, or Committee-men to a &s;trict account yearly, or oftener, according to the former cu&s;toms in the Exche|quer. The Common-wealth hath in their Officers hands at this daie remaining, Millions of monie; which is as due to them, as a man's rent is due when a Tennant enjoy's his Land-Lord's lands; and had all the accounts of the Common-wealth, been kept in a Regular waie, the publick debts might have been far better paid, and the Common-wealth have kept their Lands intire, which hath been &s;old at an under value above a Million of monie, for Rents of Lands that yearly might have been paid this Republick, to the World's end, had &s;om Members and Trea&s;urers of the late Parlament been ju&s;t.</P>
<P>SIR! This Nation may bee compared to the poor

<P>SIR! I humbly referr it to you, &s;hould &s;uch a Theif, com afore you, whether you would not think it to little to make the Theif re&s;tore to the true owner, the partie that had a great lo&s;s by fire, his own proper goods, &s;o unduly and felenou&s;ly detained, and if upon refu&s;al and denial, and ju&s;t and due proof by good witne&s;s, or taking the goods in the Theivs cu&s;todie, whether you ought not in Ju&s;tice to &s;end &s;uch Theivs to a hou&s; of Correction, or trie them by a Jurie and hang them.</P>
<P>SIR! Let mee entreat you for God's &s;ake con&s;ider, you having the power of this Nation now in your hands, whether you can an&s;wer it to God, your own
<PB N="113" REF="59"> con&s;cience, or this abu&s;ed Nation, for whom you &s;erv, now I have with all humilitie, humbly made you ac|quainted with it, if you and other worthie Members of Parlament do not do the Common-wealth right in this particular; I humbly &s;aie, it is the praiers and ex&s;pecta|tions of thou&s;ands to have this &s;trictly called to ac|count.</P>
<P><HI>Sir! I humbly pre&s;ent you not with one Theif, but with hun|dreds of Theivs, not pilfering Theivs that &s;teal's for nece&s;sitie to fill their bellies, but mightie Theivs, &s;uch as have &s;wallowed of the Common-wealth's Trea&s;ure, &s;om of them one hundred thou&s;and pounds a man;</HI> the&s;e Theivs, lurk not in barns, allies, thatch'd hou&s;es or blinde places, but in Palaces and Lord-&s;hips, which they have fraudently gotten; and al|mo&s;t every Pari&s;h in this Nation, hath one of the brood of the&s;e Caterpillers.</P>
<P>SIR! my mo&s;t humble &s;uite to you is, to remember the time of this Parlament is &s;et, the daies weeks and months run quickly about, many that have cap't and crouched to &s;everal of the late Parlament men, when they were in power; now Sir, they &s;lite and &s;corn &s;everal of them, for abu&s;ing their tru&s;t; for God's &s;ake avoid that Rock which de&s;troied &s;everal of them, which was &s;elf-&s;eeking and covetuou&s;ne&s;s, and feeding men's expe|ctation with vain delares; at la&s;t the tears of the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed a&s;cended to heaven, and God in his good time will call to account, &s;uch as while they had a band of beeing the Common-wealth's nur&s;ing Fathers, have almo&s;t &s;tarved the Childe; Sir! when this Common-wealth hath caled for bread, &s;om of them hath given it a Stone; when this Common-wealth hath been a thir&s;t, &s;om of them hath given it Vinigar and Gall in &s;tead of wine to refre&s;h them; many of them beeing men of no con&s;cience, no faith, promi&s;s-breakers and &s;elf-&s;eekers.</P>
<P>I humbly leav this to your con&s;ideration, whether the&s;e Gripers, the Trea&s;urers, Committees, and others
<PB N="114" REF="60"> of the Common-wealth's &s;punges, ought not to bee made re&s;tore what they have unju&s;tly deteined, and bee &s;queezed; to cut &s;om of the&s;e men in pieces and make them Hawk's-meat, they will bee as accepta|ble a &s;acrifice as <HI>Em&s;on</HI> and <HI>Dudley</HI> was in <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's time.</P>
