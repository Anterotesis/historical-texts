<HEAD>A DECLARATION OF THE Proceedings of 13 Kings, Princes, and Dukes, touching the pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition of the King of Scots; and their Royal Edict and Summons &s;ent to all Chri&s;tendom.</HEAD>
<P>THere hath been a great and imperial Coun|cel held at Mun&s;ter in Germany, by the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of 13 Chri&s;tian Kings, Princes, and Dukes; At which Diet, they took into con&s;idera|tion the pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition of many exiled Princes; and among&s;t the re&s;t, a Conference aro&s;e touching the King of Scots; but nothing done therein (at pre&s;ent) by rea&s;on of other weighty and
<PB N="4" REF="3">emergent bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, which call them to a Work of far greater concernment; and may al&s;o prove fatal, if not timely prevented: For the Great Turk, and his Ba&s;haw have taken the field with &s;even hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, and are re&s;olved (if po&s;&s;i|ble) to make a great deva&s;tation and inroad upon Chri&s;tendom this Summer: But great is the care of the Emperour of Germany, the 7 Chri&s;tian Princes of Italy, the Queen of Sweden, the Prince of Tran|&s;ilvania, and Prince Frederick of Malta, to rai&s;e a formidable Power, and to unite and joyn with the Venetians, both in an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive War again&s;t the Turks; And in pur&s;uance thereof, a League is concluding between the afore&s;aid Prin|ces; who have had a large con&s;ultation thereupon; But that which is thought mo&s;t requi&s;ite and fea&s;i|ble at pre&s;ent, is, the &s;ending of a Summons to all Chri&s;tendom, for Warlike Provi&s;ions to be made a|gain&s;t the Enemies thereof; And indeed great rea|&s;on have they &s;o to do; for never was a more po|tent and irre&s;i&s;table Army rai&s;ed the&s;e many years, as now the Turks and Jani&s;aries have rai&s;ed. Yet notwith&s;tanding, Prince Philip (the third Son to the Queen of Bohemia, and General to the Stases of Ve|nice) hath given them a great Overthrow neer the I&s;le of Candia, and kill'd, taken, and routed about three&s;core thou&s;and men: This Overthrow doth
<PB N="5" REF="3">exceedingly retard the Enemies De&s;ign; and as it is a great prejudice to them, &s;o it is a great advantage to Chri&s;tendom; And his Highne&s;&s;e Prince Philip hath embraced this opportunity; who by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Divine Power, hath obtained another great Victory again&s;t the Jani&s;aries: Since which Atchievements, he is called Philip the Great; a Gen|tleman of a gallant temper, and endow'd with ex|cellent Properties and Vertues, both for prudence, wi&s;dom, and magnanimity of Spirit: He is even be|come as great a Terrour to the Turks, as Alexander the Great was to the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The King of Scots hath &s;ent the Lord Wilmot with a Me&s;&s;age to the Princes of Italy, imploring Supplies and Accommodation, &s;uitable to his pre|&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities and Condition; but, they have re|turned An&s;wer, That by rea&s;on of the home-bred divi&s;ions, and forreign Preparations of the Enemy in &s;everall parts again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Territories, they could not an&s;wer his expectation at pre&s;ent, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Duke of Malta hath declared, that he will give his Royal A&s;&s;ent to the Union; and that he will rai&s;e forty thou&s;and Horfe and Foot, to joyn with the Chri&s;tians again&s;t the Turks; and in pur&s;uance thereof hath granted a Commi&s;&s;ion to Prince Fre|derick, Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, to command in chief un|der his Highne&s;s Prince Philips.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P> By an Expre&s;s from Am&s;terdam it is certified, that the General A&s;&s;embly of the United Provinces met at the Hague, where there was a large Debate touching the proclaiming of open Wars with Eng|land, otherwi&s;e to have re&s;titution and &s;atisfaction for all their &s;hips and Goods taken: But after ma|ture deliberation touching the apparent dangers that might thereby en&s;ue, the States of Holland gave in their po&s;itive Re&s;ult, declaring, That they were re&s;olved (to the utmo&s;t of their power) to pre&s;erve a firm League and Union with, the States of Eng|land; and to hold a fair corre&s;pondency for the in|crea&s;e of free Trade and Commerce: Whereupon the States and Merchants of Zealand ro&s;e up in great fury, di&s;&s;olved the A&s;&s;embly, and vowed re|venge upon the Engli&s;h; but its thought the States General will be more prudent and wi&s;e then to hearken to the cryes or gruntling of the Bores; for here is a Proverb, That the Cries of the Gee&s;e are never heard up to Heaven.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, the &s;pirits of many thou|&s;ands are much exa&s;perated, and great are the prepa|rations which are making throughout the United Provinces; The Merchants of Zealand have &s;ent 40 Commi&s;&s;ioners to the States General, to treat and two hundred &s;hips with Letters of Mart; &s;o that
<PB N="7" REF="4">they are again fat down in Councel, and its concei|ved that at this Meeting, it will be re&s;olved, to man out about 150 Men of War at the publike charge, be&s;ides what will be &s;et forth by the Merchants, and Others, upon Letters of Mart, which (if things hold at this pa&s;s) our Governors that are well-affected to England, will be in evident danger of utter ruine.</P>
<P>For great are the Conte&s;ts between the Burgo|ma&s;ters and the Bores; for the latter doth threaten to &s;eque&s;ter their E&s;tates, and bring them to a Tryall for their lives, if they will not take a cour&s;e to defend and a&s;&s;i&s;t them at Sea. And &s;ome Tumults and Ri|&s;ings have already been in Zealand, Rotterdam, Dort, Delf, and at the Hague, where many were both &s;lain and wounded, and among&s;t the re&s;t fome Engli&s;h, which the Mutiniers chiefly aymed at, and brand them with the mo&s;t infamous Badge of Tray|tors and Con&s;pirators to their Religion and Liber|ties; which they are yet to chu&s;e. And upon this Score, divers Engli&s;h Merchants are prohibited from coming upon the Exchange in Am&s;terdam, and o|ther places. 200 Commi&s;&s;ioners have bin &s;ent to all the Frontier and Haven Towns, to &s;ee how many &s;hips each Town can make ready in three weekes time: And having taken a Li&s;t thereof, upon their return, cau&s;ed the &s;ame to be printed; wherein ap|pears the &s;imilitude of a great Armado, con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="8" REF="5">about 300 &s;ayl of &s;hips, Danes, Dutch, and Ham|burgers: Be&s;ides they talk of 200 more to be &s;et forth upon Letters of Mart; but the truth is; they'l talk more by an inch of Candle in their liquor by Land, then they can perform by a whole pound, when they are in their Element at Sea. And although they build Ca&s;tles in the Ayr, make their Accounts in Spain, and re&s;olve to ca&s;t them up in England, by blocking up Dover, Sandwitch, Deal, and other Ports.</P>
<P>And the truth is, the Engli&s;h are become odious in tho&s;e parts, and dare not walk the &s;treets without great hazard to their per|&s;ons: But &s;ure it is, That the&s;e Times will not la&s;t alwayes.</P>
