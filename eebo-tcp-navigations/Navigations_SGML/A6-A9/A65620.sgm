<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Greatne&s;s of Your Maje&s;ties Judgment, as well as that of Your Condition, would deterr me from this Pre&s;umption, did I not think my &s;elf &s;afe in the God-like Clemency of Your Nature, which appears &s;o eminently, not only in Your Fatherly Care and Protection of Your Faithful Subjects, but even in Your Pardoning the Malice of Your mo&s;t Inveterate Enemies.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, at a time when from all Parts of the Nation, Your Loyal People are contending how to expre&s;s their Gratitude, both to Heaven
<PB REF="3">and You, for the Benignity of Your Reign, and the manifold Ble&s;&s;ings they enjoy under &s;o Excel|lent a Prince; I hope it will not misbecome me to make Your Maje&s;ty this mo&s;t Humble Oblation of my Duty, which proceeds from a Heart full of Reverence and Obedience for You, and po&s;&s;e&s;t with a deep &s;en&s;e of the Honour and good For|tune I have to be born Your Subject.</P>
<P>All, Sir, I pre&s;ume to pre&s;ent You with, are &s;ome Ob&s;ervations which I made in my Travels into <HI>Greece;</HI> a Country once Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Civil World, and a mo&s;t Famous Nur&s;ery both of Armes and Sciences; but now a Lamentable Ex|ample of the In&s;tability of humane things, where|in Your Maje&s;ties Di&s;contented and Factious Sub|jects, if their own late Calamities will not &s;uffi|ciently in&s;truct them, may &s;ee the Mi&s;eries that other Nations are reduced to, and behold, as in a Picture, the Natural Fruits of Schi&s;m, Rebellion and Civil Di&s;cord.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the deplorable Condition of that once Glorious Nation, I cannot but adore the mercy of God to our own; who is plea&s;ed to let us enjoy &s;uch Priviledges under Your Maje&s;ty, in a State governed by Laws, and in a Church purified from Errour and Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, Nothing is wanting to compleat our Happine&s;s, but that it would plea&s;e Almighty God to continue it, in giving Your Maje&s;ty a Long and Pro&s;perous Reign; and when it &s;hall plea&s;e him to tran&s;late You from this tran&s;itory to an Immortal Crown, to perpetuate Your Go|vernment
<PB REF="3">in Your Royal Family, as the Prudence of our Ance&s;tors, and the Politick Laws of this Ancient Monarchy have e&s;tabli&s;hed it; that we may have no more Mock-Governments, nor lo&s;e our Religion and Liberty, as we lately did, under a pretence of better &s;ecuring them.</P>
<P>As this is the de&s;ire, Sir, of all good Engli&s;h Men, &s;o I humbly conceive it is proper, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a Conjuncture as this, for every Man to own it; which mu&s;t be my excu&s;e at this time for approaching Your Maje&s;ty, as I do, and for ma|king u&s;e of this occa&s;ion of expre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf with mo&s;t profound Humility</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IT is u&s;ual for tho&s;e that publi&s;h their Writings, to give the World &s;ome account of them, by way of Preface; which is a cu&s;tom, I have no rea&s;on to neglect, &s;ince I find my &s;elf obliged, not only to make an Apology, for putting forth this Di&s;cour&s;e, but al&s;o for many things contained therein. I have rea&s;on, I &s;ay, to let the World know, what prevailed upon me, to expo&s;e both it and my &s;elf thereby to publick cen&s;ure, in an Age of &s;uch Wit and Learning as this. For I am not ignorant of tho&s;e ingenious men, who have already obliged our Nation and the World, by their Writings on great part of this &s;ubject, aided by parts and learning far excelling any thing I can pretend to. But I al&s;o as well as they, having by Gods a&s;&s;istance, had a pro&s;perous Voy|age, into tho&s;e parts of the World, and made a con&s;iderable Collection of u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations, and other Curio&s;ities, began to think, that both my time and labour &s;pent thereon, would &s;oon be inevitably lo&s;t, &s;hould I not take care to put them into &s;ome convenient method for their pre&s;ervation. And really when I con&s;idered the many and eminent dangers and difficul|ties I had by Gods wonderful Providence been delivered from; the many Obligations and &s;ignal Honours I received from &s;everal illu&s;trious Socie|ties, and generous Friends both at home and abroad; with the Happi|ne&s;s, Peace, Freedom and Tranquillity, I was returned to, and we of the&s;e Countries enjoy, above any Nation in the World: I concluded it would misbecome me, to bury &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings in Oblivion, without erect|ing the lea&s;t Monument of Gratitude in remembrance of them. There|fore enjoying &s;ome lei&s;ure in the Country &s;olitudes, I cho&s;e to retire unto, after my return, I made This and my Books my diverti&s;ement; pur|po&s;ing then only, to &s;et my Ob&s;ervations in &s;uch an u&s;eful order, as might
<PB REF="5">pre&s;erve them the better in my Memory: or at mo&s;t, upon occa&s;ion, to entertain &s;uch of my friends with them, as were curious to know how I had employed my time in tho&s;e parts; being con&s;cious that my unpoli&s;hed &s;tyle, and manner of writing, would be unfit to appear in publick, were the matter contained therein never &s;o de&s;erving.</P>
<P>But while&s;t I entertained my &s;elf with the&s;e thoughts, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon,</HI> my Fellow Traveller, &s;ent me over an account of our Voyage, which he with much Ingenuity and Learning had compiled, and Printed in French; wherein, he did me the Honour of placing my name with his in the Title, and for the mo&s;t part throughout the Book. This with great &s;atisfaction I read over; yet it did not &s;o entirely an&s;wer my de&s;ign as to make me de&s;i&s;t from the purpo&s;e I had before entred upon, although it much furthered me in the performance of it.</P>
<P>Thus between his Book, and my own Papers, I with much &s;ati&s;|faction diverted my &s;elf that Summer, which was <HI>1678.</HI> fan&s;ying my &s;elf again in the enjoyment of that happy time I &s;pent in tho&s;e parts, and his ingenious Conver&s;ation. But when I had brought my de&s;ign well near to a period, I heard, at my return to <HI>London,</HI> the following Winter, that &s;omebody was about to tran&s;late Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI>'s Book into Eng|li&s;h, and to print it.</P>
<P>Hereupon I thought my &s;elf concerned to find out the truth, and not to permit any thing to come out in Engli&s;h with my name, which was not in all points agreeable to my own &s;entiments. Which being a thing &s;carce po&s;&s;ible in &s;uch variety of matter, without a joint con&s;ultation, I thought it better to publi&s;h my own &s;ence in my own words, than to &s;uffer his words and particular &s;ence to pa&s;s in my name. And in &s;hort, comparing notes, I found I had many u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations omitted by him, which I thought very fit to be communicated to the curious among the re&s;t of our Remarks, to make the account going under both our names, as much the Relation of both as I could.</P>
<P>As to the matter contained in this Book, I find no rea&s;on I have to be a&s;hamed of it, although I do not expect it &s;hould e&s;cape cen&s;ure. For I know &s;ome will &s;ay, why does he treat us with in&s;ipid de&s;criptions of Weeds, and make us hobble after him over broken &s;tones, decayed buildings, and old rubbi&s;h? But the&s;e being things their curio&s;ity does not extend to, I &s;hould but trifle, in giving them a &s;erious An&s;wer. Others, perhaps, may not be plea&s;ed, that I have made Divine Reflections on the various events of things, and Phaenomena of nature. As to men of this irreli|gious temper, I make no other an&s;wer, but that I de&s;ign'd to write as a Chri&s;tian Traveller and Philo&s;opher; and if my Book be unacceptable to
<PB REF="5">them, becau&s;e it &s;avours of my Religion, they may leave it, as they do their Bibles, to others, who will like it better upon that account.</P>
<P>As to the Title, not only Gratitude but Ju&s;tice al&s;o requires that I &s;hould join Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI>'s name with mine, &s;ince he did me the &s;ame re&s;pect in his, and we made the Voyage together. And in compo&s;ing this Treati&s;e, I have all along had an Eye to his, &s;till comparing my notes with his, having for the greate&s;t part &s;een the &s;ame things which he did.</P>
<P>What I find Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> hath omitted, I have &s;upplied; and on the other &s;ide, what material things I found I had neglected in my own Journal, I added out of his Book, if I well remembred them. When I met with any things to be mi&s;takes, I have as freely corrected them, and in dubious Critici&s;ms I have given my own Opinion and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervations which I made, and are not to be met with in Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Spon,</HI> are various and &s;cattered throughout the whole Book: But the chiefe&s;t are, fir&s;t the Plants I have de&s;cribed, on which &s;ubject he hath not at all concerned him&s;elf. My Map of <HI>Achaia</HI> al&s;o I have added, which I made out of my own particular Ob&s;ervations, I took on the places, for that purpo&s;e. Divers Medals and other Antiquities I have by me, &s;ince &s;ent from <HI>Athens</HI> to me, and ob&s;erved after we par|ted from each other, as they lay in my method, and made for my purpo&s;e, I have in&s;erted in this account.</P>
<P>As to the curious Plants I would have added more Cuts, mo&s;t of them which I have de&s;cribed, being either unknown or very rare in our parts; but indeed the Book&s;eller was very unwilling to be burthened with them, the change of Graving being too great for his profit.</P>
<P>The Map of <HI>Achaia,</HI> I have &s;poken of, may need &s;ome things to be &s;aid in its behalf, &s;ince the Po&s;ition of the whole Scheme of it, is &s;o dif|ferent from all the Maps of tho&s;e parts we have extant; to an&s;wer for which I will give an account of my Delineation of it, being a way per|haps unu&s;ual in de&s;cribing of Land-Maps. The Ob&s;ervations I had made, being taken by the help of a Mariners Needle, from &s;everal &s;ta|tions on divers Mountains and eminent places of that Country, I thereby ea&s;ily reduced their Po&s;itions into Triangles; and thereby could hardly mi&s;s of their natural &s;ituations, nor yet to have a proportionable di&s;tance from one another, according to a &s;cale of parts propo&s;ed, from any one or two &s;everal known di&s;tances. Which though it be but an ordinary rule in &s;urveighing, yet in tho&s;e Countries, where from a Mountain, one may &s;ee twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty miles about, it may prove of more u&s;e and certainty than all the re&s;t of the Geographical Art of Longitudes in
<PB REF="6">the World. To this I had al&s;o the advantage of the Latitudes, <HI>Mr. Ver|non</HI> had with all exactne&s;s taken, of the mo&s;t eminent places contained therein, as of <HI>Patras, Delphus, Thebes, Chalcis</HI> or <HI>Egripo, Co|rinth</HI> and <HI>Athens.</HI> By adding which to the Ob&s;ervations made with the Needle, I found I could not mi&s;s of much more exactne&s;s than ever could yet be arrived at, by conjectural Longitudes, whether of the an|cient or modern Geographers. For the Bearing of two places of diffe|rent Latitudes being given, one cannot mi&s;s of a proportionable di&s;tance, according to the &s;cale of Latitude; if from the one you follow the Bear|ing to the Latitude of the other. For there is but one individual point on a Plane, that can be the &s;ame Latitude, and the &s;ame Bearing from another Latitude. As for Example, <HI>Thebes</HI> is <HI>38. D. 22. M. L. Chalcis</HI> is <HI>38. D. 31. M. L.</HI> So there is nine Minutes difference in Latitude. But the Bearing from <HI>Chalcis</HI> to <HI>Thebes</HI> is <HI>W. S. W.</HI> So a Scale of Latitudes being de&s;cribed by Parallel Lines, and <HI>Chalcis</HI> being placed thereon in <HI>38. D. 31. M. L.</HI> Draw a Line thence directly <HI>W. S. W.</HI> and where&s;oever it cuts the line of Latitude <HI>38. D. 22. M.</HI> there mu&s;t be the point where <HI>Thebes</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ituate. For any other point or di&s;tance but that, alters either the Latitude or Bearing, again&s;t the Hypothe&s;is. When I had thus &s;et down the places of principal note, e&s;pecially tho&s;e Cities, with the Mountains, Rivers, Promontories, and Harbours; the other places according to their Bearings, and reputed di&s;tances of Miles from the fir&s;t, I regulated as well as I could. Which &s;o near as their reputed di&s;tances come to the truth, &s;o near mu&s;t they be to the true Latitudes: For this Rule &s;erves both ways. If you have the true Latitudes and the Bearings, you have the true &s;ituation; &s;o if you have the true Latitude of one place, and the true Bearings and di|&s;tances thence to the places adjacent, you have al&s;o the true Lati|tudes.</P>
<P>This Rule if it were well improved, might produce Maps more exact than any we have yet had, and make the much de&s;ired Longitude le&s;s valuable in Geography. For this would give a true proportionable di|&s;tance from place to place, which is the thing &s;o much pretended to by Longitudes; but is more by chance, than Science, at any time, if ever, arrived to.</P>
<P>That this is practicable to particular Places and Countries, I have given a proof; and how it may be applicable to the general Geography of the World, I will propo&s;e in two or three words, and leave it to be im|proved and con&s;idered by tho&s;e of better parts and more lei&s;ure than my &s;elf. Suppo&s;e then only that two points of Po&s;ition or Bearing were
<PB REF="6">added to the two points of Latitude on the Globe, and place them in two eminent places on the Equinoctial Line, or on one only till we can come to the knowledge of its oppo&s;ite point, by more experience: Let this be the Center of a Circle divided into <HI>360.</HI> degrees, which will &s;erve both for the degrees of Latitude and for the degrees of Bearing. From the&s;e Centers let Lines be drawn to every tenth degree, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the points of Bearing, and Parallel Lines to the Equator, from every tenth degree to tenth degree, to di&s;tingui&s;h the Latitudes. And the&s;e are all the nece&s;&s;ary Lines I can think on. As to the Colures, they will be of no further u&s;e; and the Tropicks, Ecliptick, Arctick and An|tarctick Circles, they appertain rather to the Cele&s;tial Globe than the Terre&s;trial.</P>
<P>Thus as the Equator divides the World into two equal parts of Nor|thern and Southern Latitude, &s;o would this divide it into two equal parts of Bearing, Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern. Thus the Lines of Bearing, cutting the Lines of Latitude, all things might be placed on the Globe with the greate&s;t ea&s;e imaginable, from the be&s;t and correcte&s;t Charts, Maps, and Ob&s;ervations of Travellers, either on the Globe or a Plain. Thus in time by diligence and correct Ob&s;ervations, the defects of the &s;uppo&s;ed Longitude would be taken away; and Tables of Bearing cor|rectly collected and ordered in their &s;tead: and the various contractions of the degrees of Longitude, according to the di&s;tance of the Parallels from the Equator, would likewi&s;e be taken away. Which is another incurable defect in the &s;uppo&s;ititious degrees of Longitude. For thus all the Circles would be equal, cutting the Globe into equal parts.</P>
<P>But to return to my Map of <HI>Achaia,</HI> I have in&s;cribed the ancient names of the Provinces, Mountains, Rivers, Promontories, Ports and Bayes; but of the Towns only the pre&s;ent names; for had I had always room to do it, it would only have bred a confu&s;ion between them. I be|gan indeed with <HI>Attica</HI> in&s;tead of the ancient names to mark them with Figures referring to a Catalogue of them; but finding it too tedious a work &s;uddenly to go through with, I proceeded no further, but left it to another opportunity, to fini&s;h a Geographical Di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e parts, e&s;pecially <HI>Attica,</HI> I long &s;ince began and de&s;igned in Latine; wherein I &s;hall explain my Marble of the Tribes by giving an account of their divi&s;ion into <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Borough-Towns.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I have contented my &s;elf with making a Catalogue of tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations I have, and placing it at the bottom of the Map, adorn|ing it al&s;o about the margent with &s;uch figures of the principal places as I thought proper, thereby to make it an Ornament for a Study as well as
<PB REF="7">to this Book. And this is the rea&s;on you will find &s;ome of the titles of the Figures in Latine and &s;ome in Engli&s;h, which mi&s;&s;ed my ob&s;ervation before they were printed off, otherwi&s;e they might have been al|tered again.</P>
<P>There are other faults I find, &s;ome whereof are my own, and &s;ome the Printers. Tho&s;e of the Printers mo&s;t of them are happened I &s;uppo&s;e, by rea&s;on of my di&s;tance from the Pre&s;s, living in the Country; and for them I mu&s;t refer you to the <HI>Errata.</HI></P>
<P>As for tho&s;e of my own, I have ob&s;erved &s;ince the Printing, they are</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Page 12.</HI> That a <HI>Se&s;tertium</HI> or <HI>Se&s;tertius</HI> is a piece of mo|ney weighing about two pence half peny, in which it &s;eems I trusted too much to my memory; for it weighs but two pence, as I weighed one I have, by two pence of our new mill'd money. But by Mr. <HI>Greaves</HI> his account of the Roman <HI>Denarius</HI> it &s;hould not be quite &s;o much; for he makes a <HI>Denarius,</HI> of which this is the fourth part, to weigh but &s;even pence half peny farthing; however con&s;idering the finene&s;s of the &s;ilver, in re&s;pect to the alloy of our Standard, we may well reckon it worth two pence, if not more. So that the whole co&s;t was about five pounds five &s;hillings of our money; by which may be judged the decrea&s;e of the value of &s;ilver &s;ince tho&s;e dayes.</P>
<P>In the Figure of <HI>Zara, Page 8.</HI> the Ba&s;tions of the Walls of the Town ought to be round as I have de&s;cribed them, although I find in the Figure, both he that de&s;igned it from my Scetch, and the Engraver af|ter him, have made them &s;quare.</P>
<P><HI>Page 32.2. The Soil of Corfu,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>Vel hir&s;uto,</HI> is a tran&s;po&s;ition, and ought to follow after <HI>Wife and all. Page 34.</HI> Which is the fault of the Copyi&s;t I made u&s;e of, not ob&s;erving the marks of interpo&s;ition I gave him on my foul Copy.</P>
<P><HI>Page 405.</HI> Speaking of the Images of <HI>Ceres,</HI> I have by me, I have &s;aid, <HI>&s;he holdeth &s;omething round in her other hand;</HI> which, out of St. <HI>Aug. de Civitate Dei, Lib. 7. c. 24.</HI> I have &s;ince ob|&s;erved to be a kind of Hand-Drum, he calls <HI>Tympanum,</HI> being an In|&s;trument they u&s;ed to &s;ound before her, as the Mother of the Gods. Under which name the Heathens did comprehend not only the <HI>Phrygian Cybele,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Ceres, Pro&s;erpina, Ve&s;ta,</HI> and &s;everal others of the Godde&s;&s;es. <HI>Aug. Lib. 7. c. 15.</HI> And as the Mother of the Gods, undoubtedly the Athenians took their
&Dgr;&EEgr;&Mgr;&EEgr;&Tgr;&EEgr;&Rgr;:
as appears, by all tho&s;e marks of the Lyons, the <HI>tympanum,</HI> and the &s;acrificing Plate; only the Basket of Fruit on her Head, in&s;tead of the Towered Crown, di|&s;tingui&s;ht her more peculiarly to be <HI>Ceres.</HI> I have two <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-Relievos</HI> I
<PB REF="7">de&s;igned at <HI>Rome,</HI> which exactly agree with the de&s;cription St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tine</HI> gives of the Mother of the Gods, which would be here too long to in&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P>In reading over this Book I ob&s;erve that &s;everal of the Medals de|&s;cribed therein, and cut on the Plates, have no reference marked in the Margent to find them as I ordered; therefore tho&s;e that are curious to &s;ee them, may turn to the Plates and find them in their order.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you al&s;o that the account I have given you of the mea&s;ures of things mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the French foot which only I had by me, and is half an inch bigger than the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The&s;e are what I ob&s;erved, and hope are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable faults of this Book; what others have &s;lipped by my notice, mu&s;t be &s;upported by tho&s;e that will read this Treati&s;e, and con&s;idered as Badges of hu|manity, who&s;e limited and frail nature is &s;uch, that it cannot be wi&s;e in all things; no more than were it &s;o, it can be wi&s;e to all men. I am &s;ure there is nothing in it &s;o ill but it was meant well, therefore if ei|ther what is well or ill meet with a candid con&s;truction, I &s;hall neither think my time mi&s;pent that I employed thus, to divert my &s;elf in writing it, nor ill be&s;towed on tho&s;e that &s;hall reap any benefit or &s;atisfaction by the publi&s;hing of it.</P>

<HEAD>THE Fir&s;t BOOK: CONTAINING A VOYAGE FROM VENICE TO CONSTANTINOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>_AFTER I had employed the greate&s;t part of two years time in &s;urveying the mo&s;t eminent parts of France and Italy, I re&s;olved, by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to make this Voyage into the Levant; to which pur|po&s;e I ha&s;ten'd to Venice, where I arrived about the beginning of June, in the year 1675. The fir&s;t thing I did there was to find out my Companion, Mon|&s;ieur Spon, Doctor of Phy&s;ic, of Lyons, whom, by a particular acquain|tance I had made with him at Rome, I knew to be a very di&s;creet and ingenious per&s;on, and therefore had made choice of him, rather than any other, to be my Fellow-Traveller in this my intended Voyage. Of him I under&s;tood, that in a &s;hort time, a Bailo, or Amba&s;&s;ador from the State of Venice, was to part for Con&s;tantinople, to the Grand Signior's Court: Until which time we re&s;olved to go to Padua, there to &s;pend &s;ome time in &s;eeing that illu&s;trious Univer&s;ity, and to inform

<PB N="2" REF="15">our &s;elves of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary particularities concerning the State of Venice, and then to return back again, and provide our &s;elves with &s;uch things as our Voyage required. This I thought very convenient, in order to my better Information, great part of my Journey being like to be through the Venetian Territories; and therefore, I think, it may not be altogether impertinent to give a &s;hort Account of that &s;o ancient, wi&s;e, and potent Republic.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;erene Republic of Venice, as they are &s;tiled, is the ancient|e&s;t Free-State that now flouri&s;heth in the World; and notwith&s;tan|ding the great lo&s;&s;es they have &s;u&s;tained from the innumerable Armies of the Turks, have yet &s;uch large and fruitful Territories, as make them the objects of the Envy and Jealou&s;ie, not only of the Grand Signior, but al&s;o of mo&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Princes, their Neighbours.</P>
<P>Their Hi&s;torians calculate their beginning from the fifth Century, about which time the Goths, Huns, and Vandals enter'd into Italy, de|&s;troying and &s;acking great part of the chief Cities of it; among which was Altinum, &s;ituated at the bottom of the Gulph Northwards from Venice, the Ruines whereof retain &s;till the name of Altino, which was (as they &s;ay) de&s;troyed by Attila. From this Altinum, Aquileia, and other Neighbouring Cities, &s;uch as could e&s;cape the &s;ury of Attila, fled to the&s;e little I&s;lands, where now Venice &s;tandeth. Thus did they unen|vied, and un&s;u&s;pected, in the la&s;t extremity of Fortune, lay the fir&s;t Foundations of one of the noble&s;t, riche&s;t, and &s;ecure&s;t Cities in the World. And although in &s;everal Ages after, their encrea&s;e was not full &s;o con&s;iderable, as to be feared or envied, yet &s;o &s;oon as they began to be &s;o, they &s;till defended them&s;elves with &s;o great &s;ucce&s;s, as made their Neighbours content to be at Peace with them.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t Victories were over Dalmatia and I&s;tria, and after having conquered the Anconians, and others, at Sea, they rendered them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Adriatick Gulph. After this, they encrea&s;ed &s;o in Riches and Strength, that by the fifteenth Century they had render'd them&s;elves compleat Ma&s;ters of Friuli, Padua, Verona, Vicenza, Bre&s;&s;ia, Bergamo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with tho&s;e ample and mo&s;t fruitful Territories about them. They had Romagnia under their protection, and Puglia their Feudatory, and at la&s;t became Ma&s;ters of the Morea, and the greate&s;t part of the I&s;lands of the Archipelago, with Negropont, and the King|doms of Cyprus and Candia; which la&s;t they defended bravely twenty three years, and at la&s;t parted with it with Honour, and it may be, with le&s;s prejudice to them&s;elves, than to the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>But now among the I&s;lands of the Archipelago, they have only Cerigo and Tine; which, with I&s;tria, and the Coa&s;ts of Dalmatia, Corfu, Cepha|lonia, and Zant, are all that remain of the Levant part of their Domi|nions: All which Provinces, and Cities in them, are commanded by Governours, dignified with particular Titles, according to the great|ne&s;s and importance of the &s;everal places, as Generals, Proveditors, or Counts, who are cho&s;en by the Senate, and enabled by their deputed Power to act and judge in all Cau&s;es; from who&s;e Sentence no Appeal can be made, but only to the Senate of Venice. They are cho&s;en out of the Families of the Nobles, and during their Government, are as Princes: But &s;o &s;oon as that is expired, they are reduced again to their
<PB N="3" REF="15">fir&s;t Principles of a private Life; which they return to with &s;o much evenne&s;s of Temper, and &s;o unconcern'd, as &s;hews they knew how to Obey, before they were entru&s;ted with Command.</P>
<P>We had not &s;tay'd above a Week at Padua, but News was brought us, that the Bailo was ready to part, which ha&s;ten'd us again to Venice; where, as &s;oon as we were arriv'd, we found it &s;o true, that we had but that day to prepare our &s;elves for &s;o great a Voyage, get Licen&s;e to Embark in one of the Gallies, and to order our Letters of Credit; which although they be nece&s;&s;ary in &s;o long a Journey, yet many things el&s;e are requi&s;ite to one who intends to make the be&s;t advantage of his time in tho&s;e remote parts; e&s;pecially a good Sea-Compa&s;s, a Quadrant, or other In&s;trument to take Latitudes, and a mea&s;ure of a Foot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But my ha&s;t gave me not lea&s;ure to get the &s;econd; which when I &s;aw the Errors of our modern and ancient Maps, I too late wi&s;h'd for.</P>
<P>The <HI>20th</HI> of June I again return'd to Venice, went to Signior Bene|detto Sanudo, a noble Venetian, who was Captain of the Galley called <HI>Il Hercule in cunea,</HI> and one of the two that was appointed to carry and accompany the Amba&s;&s;ador. Of him, though with &s;ome difficulty, I obtain'd the favour of pa&s;&s;age for my &s;elf, and Mon&s;ieur Spon, on Board his Galley.</P>
<P>About Midnight we &s;et Sail from Venice, the Wind being fair, though &s;o gentle a Gale, and the Water &s;o &s;mooth, that we hardly perceived we made way: Neverthele&s;s by the next Morning we were in &s;ight of the &s;hore of I&s;tria, and about two hours before Noon we arrived at the Scoglio, or little I&s;land of St. Andr&egrave;, on the &s;ame &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St.</HI> Andr&egrave;.</NOTE> where there is only a Convent of Franci&s;can Fryars, made plea&s;ant by the delightful Pro&s;pects of the Woods, Hills, and Sea, environing that little Scoglio.</P>
<P>It being determined, that we &s;hould &s;pend the re&s;t of the day here, and that I&s;land affording but little other Entertainments, I went that Afternoon a Simpling; which was a Curio&s;ity &s;eldom failed to give me &s;atisfaction, when all other Diverti&s;ements were wanting. And truly this little Spot afforded me Entertainment of that nature beyond expectation: There I found,

<P>Hard by this I&s;land, upon the &s;hore of I&s;tria, is Ruigna, &s;ituated upon a little Penin&s;ula, and inhabited altogether by Sea-men, who are mo&s;t of them profe&s;s'd Pilots; and for their encouragement, all Ships, whe|ther Venetians or Strangers, are obliged to touch there, and to take a profe&s;s'd Pilot of this place, to Steer them over the Flats that are before the entrance into the Venetian Harbours, which are very difficult and dangerous. I heard the Pilot &s;ay, that conducted the Ve&s;&s;el I return'd in, that it had &s;ometimes but half a Foot, and &s;ometimes not above an Inch of Water below its Keel. Ruigna hath a very good and &s;ecure Haven, and that by nature, without the help of Art. The Country about it is fruitful in excellent Wines and Oyl, which may be the rea&s;on that there are &s;o many decrepit per&s;ons there, &s;trong Wine being the producer of Gouts and Sciatica's. The Women wear Fardingals here, after the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion. The Town is not big, but &s;eems populous, and is a Bi&s;hop's &s;ee.</P>

<P>The next day early we parted from St. Andr&egrave;; but the Sea running high, although there was but little Wind, (which the Mariners told us, was u&s;ual in tho&s;e Seas about the Change of the Moon, as then it was) we put in at Pola, about ten Miles from St. Andr&egrave;.</P>

<P>Pola is one of the mo&s;t an|cient Cities of I&s;tria,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pola.</NOTE> &s;ituated at the farther end of a little Bay, which makes a mo&s;t &s;ecure and &s;pacious Port, every way Land|lock'd: But tho&s;e that look upon the &s;mall number of its Inhabitants at pre&s;ent, &s;carcely amounting to &s;even or eight Hundred, would hardly credit its former greatne&s;s, without &s;uch eminent Marks of its An|tiquity, as &s;till remain. That it hath been a Free-State, or Commonwealth, we found upon the Pede&s;tal of a Sta|tue of the Emperour Severus, whereon is engraven the Dedi|cation by <HI>Re&s;publica Polen&s;is,</HI> or the Commonwealth of Pola. The marks of its greatne&s;s are its Amphitheater, Triumphant-Arch, and Temple, dedicated to Rome and Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar. Authors agree not concerning its fir&s;t beginning. The Poet, Callimachus, affirms it was a Colony of Cholcis, who pur&s;ued the Argonauts by Sea; whom ha|ving lo&s;t in the pur&s;uit, and not daring to return to their King, they voluntarily bani&s;hed them&s;elves their Country, and planted this. Wherefore their City was called <HI>Pola;</HI> which &s;ignifieth (if we may believe Strabo) a bani&s;hed people. Nor can they agree what way they took to come to this place. Some will have it, that they came by the Euxin-Sea, up the Danube, formerly called I&s;ter; which made them give the name of I&s;tria to the Country they came to inhabit; and that they afterwards &s;ail'd in the Adriatick-Sea with the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;els: a thing impo&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s they carried them upon their &s;houlders; the Danube having no communication with the Venetian-Gulph. Yet that they were a Colony of &s;ome of the Graecians, may be concluded from their main money &s;till coyned with the name of their Country in Greek Letters; of which I have &s;een &s;everal, but e&s;pecially one of un|doubted antiquity in the curious Collection of the Earl of <HI>Peterbo|rough,</HI> &amp;c. which hath &s;tamped on the one &s;ide two young faces, re|ver&s;ed to each other; and on the other an Eagle preying on a Dol|phin, with the&s;e Letters circum&s;crib'd

III. VIRI TRIBUNIC. POTEST.
<PB N="6" REF="17"><HI>To Rome and Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> as before &s;aid. There is al&s;o the ruins of another hard by: and the Dome, or Cathedral Church &s;eemeth to be built upon another, by the ruins about it, and ancient Stones compiled in the building. The Font for holy Water hath been an ancient Fountain of white Marble four &s;quare. At each &s;ide the Wa|ter flowed over, and made a pretty Ca&s;cade, de&s;cending by &s;everal degrees; fir&s;t running over Nimphs on the two oppo&s;ite &s;ides, and two Scallop-&s;hells on the other two oppo&s;ite. The Triumphal-Arch was built in honour of one <HI>Caius Sergius,</HI> by his Wife <HI>Salvia Po&s;thuma,</HI> and was adorned with his, and others of the Families Statues, as may be judged by the form of it. It is of the Corinthian-order, of White Marble: But is now become only the Ea&s;t-gate to the Town, though formerly one of the Principal Ornaments thereof. The Amphithea|ter is without the Town northwards, and wants much of the Great|ne&s;s, either of that of Rome, or that of Verona. It is of the Tu&s;|can-order, and is judged to have had no other &s;eats within, than of wood. Be&s;ide the&s;e we found &s;ome Sepulchral-Monuments of le&s;&s;er note; which if they be thought worth it, I &s;hall make publick here|after. It hath a Cittadel upon a Rock within the Walls, but incon&s;i|derable for &s;trength. It hath plenty of Provi&s;ions, and good Water. The long &s;lip of Rocks, South of it, though barren enough, is not|with&s;tanding &s;tored with many curious Plants. The&s;e I ob&s;erved: 1. <HI>Acacia Poetarum.</HI> 2. <HI>Cri&s;ta galli flore purpureo.</HI> 3. <HI>Trifolium Saxa|tile, Hir&s;uti&s;&s;imum.</HI> 4. <HI>Geni&s;ta Montana Arbore&s;cens.</HI> 5. <HI>Polygala re|centiorum.</HI> 6. <HI>Leucoium Patavinum.</HI> 7. <HI>Pentaphyllon incanum;</HI> that which Gerard gives for this, hath but three leaves; but this hath five. 8. <HI>Cordilium Creticum.</HI> 9. <HI>Secoridaca flore albo,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>On Saint John Bapti&s;t's day, in the morning, we tried to get out of the Harbour; but the Wind being contrary, and higher than we thought, while we were in that calm Port, we were forced to return to a little creek at the mouth, ju&s;t within the Promontory of the Southern-Harbour, and there &s;tay till after Dinner. In which time I went, and climed up a Mountainous Rock hard by; where I found many other curious Plants. 1. <HI>Sage</HI> growing wild. 2. <HI>Tragoriga|num Creticum,</HI> as &s;ome will have it; but I e&s;teem it <HI>Satureia,</HI> or what we call in our Kitchins, <HI>Winter-Savoury;</HI> and that from the re&s;em|blance of &s;mell, and &s;ub&s;tance of the leaves; which are not &s;o thick and oyly as <HI>Tragoriganum;</HI> as likewi&s;e <HI>Polium, Roris marini foliis,</HI> or leaves like Ro&s;e-mary.</P>
<P>After Dinner we put out to Sea, but not without danger; the Wind continuing &s;till high, and contrary. After we had made &s;ix miles, (which is the length of the Bay, which makes the Haven of Pola) a &s;torm beginning to ri&s;e, we put in between the point, and the I&s;land Veruda; which with the Land, and &s;ome other &s;uch Scoglio's about it, make a good harbour. Here the Holy Virgin is wor&s;hipped with great Devotion, by the name of <HI>Madonna di Veruda;</HI> Her Church, with the Convent, belongeth to the Minime-Fryers.</P>
<P>The next day early we parted hence, to pa&s;s a dangerous Gulph, called the <HI>Quarner,</HI> Thirty miles over. It hath at the bottom to the North the Mountain, <HI>Caldiera,</HI> which often &s;ends forth &s;uch gu&s;ts of
<PB N="7" REF="17">Wind, as are fatal to the Ve&s;&s;els that mu&s;t pa&s;s it. Its high ridges look a far off, like an overgrown Cammel, with a great bunch upon the back. When we had pa&s;&s;ed about Twenty miles of the Thirty, and had about Ten to the Mountains of O&s;&s;ero, we &s;aw a great &s;torm pur&s;uing of us, which overtook us about four miles from Shore; but with &s;uch fury, as made us immediately &s;trike Sail; it being an Hurricano, or Whirl-wind, that had almo&s;t over&s;et the Gally, before we could furl the Sails. It was accompanied with &s;uch Thundring, Lightning and Rain, as if the Elements had con&s;pired to our de&s;tru|ction. The Sea al&s;o ran &s;o high, that we could neither Sail, nor Row; yet by Gods mercy, and the help of the Rudder, we were droven after an hours time (although we could no way &s;ee the Land) under the Mountains of O&s;&s;ero, and thence we rowed into <HI>Porto-longo;</HI> which is on the North &s;ide of the I&s;le Unia. In this I&s;le there is but one Vil|lage, encompa&s;&s;ed with a fertile &s;oil, containing in all about nine, or ten miles in circuit, abounding in Corn and Wine; but the re&s;t very rocky and barren. Of Plants here are abundance, &s;uch as I before named, and over and above a <HI>Syderitis Angu&s;tifolia, flore albo.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we endeavoured to get out to Sea; but finding the water too rough, we turned into <HI>Porto-novo,</HI> which is a little creek between the Mountains of O&s;&s;ero. After noon, the weather proving better, we &s;et &s;ail, and pa&s;&s;ed between many little I&s;lands (which along tho&s;e Coa&s;ts are numberle&s;s) as Canigula and San&s;io South of us, in the Gulph Quarnerette: which towards the Land hath the Moun|tains of Morlaca: Towards the Ea&s;t San-Pietro in Limbo, being two little I&s;les, thorough which we pa&s;&s;ed, making a good Harbour with a little Fort at the Ea&s;t-end of the mo&s;t Northern of them.</P>
<P>Hence we left Selva, with a pretty Town upon it, to the South: Oppo&s;ite to which is L' Ulba; which hath North-Port Saint Nicola at one end, without any Town there; but hath one about three miles di&s;tant. Here groweth abundance of Samphire: of which the Mari|ners gathered great quantity to boil, and eat with Oyl and Vinegar. Here I found a Plant with a Bulbous-root, which &s;ent out a &s;talk about half a foot high, with a cre&s;t, or crown of little &s;mall flowers, &s;triped with white and Cinnamon-colour. I &s;hould have taken it for a Moly, but that it had no &s;mell: and for an A&s;phodil, had I found any leaves at the root. Another like Samphire, but that each leaf ended with a Pricket.</P>
<P>The next day we pa&s;&s;ed by many Rocks, lying in a row, South of us; as Melada, on which is a Town called Ce&s;tron. Then Rap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|tello, and &s;ome others beyond; until at la&s;t, as in a River between little I&s;lands, we arrived at Zara.</P>

The Harbour is on the North-&s;ide, and is well &s;ecured by the City; which &s;erves in&s;tead of a Mole, to defend it from the South-winds; there being no other, that annoy it from the adjoyning Land. It lieth in length Ea&s;t and We&s;t. The entrance of the Port is We&s;t; where it hath two round Ba&s;tions, with Cannon mounted on them: which &s;aluted our Bailo, as al&s;o did the Musketteers from the Walls; and upon his arrival in the Port, the Count and Captain of the Mili|tary-forces received him at his Landing. They were cloathed in crim|&s;on Suits and Gowns, made &s;omething like the Civilians Gowns at Oxon. The Bailo al&s;o was in a crim&s;on &s;ute, but made after the French fa&s;hion. The&s;e, with the Militia, conducted him to the Palace of the General of Dalmatia, who re&s;ides there. The Ea&s;t-&s;ide hath three Ba&s;tions, and is defended by a &s;trong Cittadel, who&s;e Fortification &s;hews it had a good contriver, and a great deal of indu&s;try to bring it to that perfection. Its Fo&s;&s;es are hewed out of the hard Rocks; which is the &s;ub&s;tance of the greate&s;t part of the ground thereabouts, and renders it very difficult to be mined. Its Ba&s;tions, Half-moons, and Counter&s;carps are well countermined, and mantled with hewen &s;tone. The end of the Town, next the Cittadel, hath three regular Ba&s;tions, and is &s;eparate from it by a deep Fo&s;&s;e. There is no Hill near it, to command it from without: So that it may pa&s;s for a &s;trong Town; as it is al&s;o the chief of Dalmatia.

<P>The North-gate, Saint Chry&s;ogono, by the Harbour, is part of an Arch, brought (as &s;ome of the Town yet remember) from about a mile off. Whence it is evident, the City was much larger formerly, than now it is. The In&s;cription &s;hews, that it was built by <HI>Melia Aniana</HI> to the memory of her Husband, <HI>Lupicius Ba&s;&s;us,</HI> and that it was in a Market-place, and adorned with Statues, and co&s;t Six hun|dred and Thirty Se&s;tertia, which is a piece of money that weigheth about Two-pence halfpeny, and amounts to near Twelve pounds &s;terling; which was a great deal of money in tho&s;e days. We heard there was a Theater, where now the Cittadel is; but de&s;troyed, when that was fortify'd.</P>
<P>About a mile, or two, out of Town we &s;aw &s;ome Ruins running Northward, and we were informed, they were continued near Thirty miles. Signior <HI>Valerio Ponte,</HI> Archdeacon of this place, a&s;&s;ured us, that near the&s;e Ruins was found an In&s;cription of the Emperor Trajan; which made him believe he was the Donor of it. It was undoubtedly an Aqueduct, to &s;upply the Town with Spring-water; whereof it is &s;till de&s;titute; having none, but what comes from the Heavens, and is collected into Ci&s;terns under the ground, in &s;everal places of the City; as, near the Generals Palace by the middle Ba&s;tion, at the Ea&s;t-end of the City, at the We&s;t-end near the Gate, and in the Herb-Market. I know not well how the&s;e Ci&s;terns are made here; whether they are cut out of the Rock the Town &s;tands upon, or whe|ther
<PB N="13" REF="20">the Rock lies as deep as the Water of the Sea. But mo&s;t likely they are made as at Venice; where it is very &s;trange, that they who lie &s;o far into the Sea, having their ground &s;oft and &s;pungy, yet their Ci&s;terns pre&s;erve water (without the lea&s;t bracki&s;hne&s;s) always &s;weet, and as whole&s;ome as any in the world. Wherefore, I gue&s;s, it may not be ungrateful to the curious, to have an account of what I ob&s;erved at Venice, concerning them.</P>
<P>After they have dug the place as deep, and as wide, as will &s;erve their purpo&s;e, they lay a good foundation, and pave it with Stone and Plai&s;ter of Paris, very well, laying a large Stone in the middle, or at &s;uch place as they intend to draw the water out: Upon which is built a Cylinder, in form of our Wells, of Brick or Stone, laid upon one another without any Mortar or Cement. The Walls al&s;o being well Terra&s;&s;ed, they bring a &s;ort of fre&s;h, &s;tiff, blewi&s;h-colour'd Clay from the Land; which they fir&s;t lay about half a foot thick upon the bot|tom, beginning round from the Cylinder to the Walls: and then they begin to rai&s;e it a foot and half, or thereabouts. Then fill the whole Ci&s;tern with the be&s;t clear Sand they can find (which they fetch from Lido) near the City; and as they fill it with Sand up higher and higher, &s;o they rai&s;e the Clay about the Walls until they come unto the top. After which they put fre&s;h water all over the Sand, partly to make it &s;ettle; and therefore as it &s;inks, they fill it up with more Sand, until it hath its due proportion; and partly to take away all &s;altne&s;s from the Sand, which is taken from the Sea-&s;ide. And therefore they &s;till draw it out of the Well as fa&s;t as it &s;inks into it, until they find no more &s;altne&s;s in it. After which they cover it with an Arch, leaving three, or four holes, or more, of a foot, or thereabouts, Dia|meter, which they fill with &s;punges; and that is to hinder all dirt, that comes with the rain-water, from entring into the Ci&s;tern. The&s;e holes they cover with a &s;mall Iron Grate, or a Stone, pierced and bored thorough in &s;everal places, contriving the upper pavement over the Arch in &s;uch &s;ort, that all the water that falls near the place, runs di|rectly into the Ci&s;tern. This I learned of <HI>Signior Bartholomeo Morelli,</HI> Brother to a great and rich Banker of Venice; who, while I was at Venice, made one about his hou&s;e for his convenience; which I &s;aw, as I have related. This may be very u&s;eful to many Sea-Towns, which want good fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>The Count, or Governour of this place, is <HI>Signior Antonio Soderino,</HI> of a Noble Venetian Family, who, be&s;ides his Eminent Quality, is a Per&s;on no le&s;s obliging, than ingenious, very curious in Medals; of which the number he hath is far le&s;s con&s;iderable, than the rarity, and neatne&s;s of the pieces. He hath travelled in all Parts of the Levant, where he collected the greate&s;t part of them. Some of which indeed are &s;o curious, as not only exceeded our expectation, but gave us hopes, that in our Travels into tho&s;e Parts we might al&s;o find &s;ome worth the pains of collecting. We had a Letter of recommendation to him, to have the favour of &s;eeing his Cabinet; upon which he received us with a great deal of obligingne&s;s, and &s;hewed us, a|mong many curious pieces, two Otho's of Bra&s;s, one Greek, the other Latin; which in Mon&s;ieur Spon's judgment, were un|doubtedly
<PB N="14" REF="21">ancient; and an Antoninus Pius; the Rever&s;e of which was Orpheus, playing on his Harp, with all &s;orts of Animals about him, as charmed by his Mu&s;ick. Mon&s;ieur Spon &s;peaks of Five Otho's; but I ob&s;erved but Two of them in my Journal, which are tho&s;e he hath cau&s;ed to be engraven; and are the&s;e I give you.</P>
<P>I &s;hould abu&s;e the Obligation we received of him, to pa&s;s it by with|out mentioning his Courte&s;ie; which was &s;o extraordinary. After he had taken a great deal of pains in &s;hewing us his Cabinet, he with as great kindne&s;s obliged us to &s;up with him; where he gave us a no|ble Treat, and in the mean time, unknown to us, &s;ent for all our bag|gage from our lodging, where we &s;hould have had but bad accom|modation, the &s;mall humber of &s;trangers, that pa&s;s that way, giving but little encouragement to Inns, and obliged us to make u&s;e of a hand&s;ome Apartment he a&s;&s;igned for us in his Palace: At which we were much &s;urprized, when we were to take our leaves of him that night. But his civility &s;top'd not here; for he engaged us to make his Palace our Inn, during our &s;tay in that place; which was five days longer.</P>
<P>July the fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zara Vechia.</NOTE> the Wind being fair, and a brisk gale; we &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed by Zara Vechia, or Old Zara, which is about Eighteen miles from the other. We &s;ailed between the Land and &s;everal little I&s;lands, which make a Channel like to a River, deep enough for Gallies, but not for Ships of any burthen. The Inhabitants on both &s;ides make the be&s;t they can of a &s;hallow, and rocky &s;oil. The &s;urface of the Earth (as I was informed) is covered with a &s;caly rock; which being pared off, and laid in heaps, there appears a mo&s;t fruitful &s;oil, which they plant with Olives and Vines, which bear good Muskadel-Wines, and in great plenty.</P>
<P>In three hours time we came to Mortaro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mortaro.</NOTE> Thirty miles from Zara. This Port is made between two I&s;lands, lying together, with high, rocky Mountains round about.

<P>The next day we parted hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sabenigo.</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ight of Sabenigo, the &s;tronge&s;t City of Dalmatia belonging to the State of Venice. Its In|habitants are e&s;teemed &s;even or eight thou&s;and Souls, and we could di&s;cern from the Gally by the help of a Per&s;pective-gla&s;s four Forts. Of which we were informed one near the Harbour, is called Saint Nicholas. The other is the Works that mantle the Town. The other two are upon too little Rocks near the Town, called the Baron, and Saint Andrew. The Dome is much prai&s;ed by the Venetians, be|ing all of Marble, and the Architecture very good. There is a
<PB N="15" REF="21">little I&s;land, ju&s;t again&s;t the Town, called the <HI>I&s;ola D'oro,</HI> the gol|den I&s;land, from its plea&s;antne&s;s. From Zara it is counted Fifty miles to this place. Hence we parted, and &s;aw Trau more Ea&s;t|wards. We pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal Scoglio's Southward of us, as Saint Andr&egrave;, Buza, L'I&s;&s;a, Girone, and Salta, which lie South of Spalato, where we arrived the &s;econd of July.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>Spalato, or as &s;ome call it Spalatro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spalato.</NOTE> &s;eemeth to be a corruption of the word Palatium. For the Town that now is here, was the Palace of the Emperour Diocle&s;ian. Its &s;ituation is very remarkable; the Land whereon it &s;tands being a Penin&s;ula, joyned to the Firm Land of Dalmatia by an I&s;thmus of about a mile over; where it is Walled in by a prodigious precipice of Mountains, ranged along tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, thorough which it hath only one entrance into the Firm Land by a very narrow pa&s;&s;age; which is defended by a Fort built upon a Rock ju&s;t in the entrance, about eight miles Northward from the City. The Sea thus encompa&s;&s;ing it, makes a very delightful pro&s;pect from &s;ome little hills lying We&s;twards from the Town. I take this Penin&s;ula to be about four miles Ea&s;t and We&s;t; but it is e&s;teemed eight miles from Spalato to Cli&s;&s;a Northwards.</P>
<P>The Town is &s;ituated on the South-coa&s;ts at the bottom of a Bay, in the bending &s;hape of a half-moon, which makes a deep Haven, and of good Anchoridge, but &s;omewhat open to the South-winds. Yet Gallies, and &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els have a Mole to &s;ecure them from tho&s;e dangers. This place is about four hundred miles from Venice. It hath a very plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, entring the Haven; one &s;ide of the Pa|lace, now part of the Wall of the Town, fir&s;t offering it &s;elf to the view. For it hath a Gallery of ancient Windows, adorned with Pil|lars, and Corni&s;hes between each of them, of the Dorick-Order; ex|cept
<PB N="16" REF="22">one at each end, which are larger, and of the Corinthian. This Palace is &s;quare, and comprehends above two parts of three of the City; the re&s;t, being a little oblong, added to the We&s;t-&s;ide, makes the whole oblong; but both one and the other are lately fortified, and encompa&s;&s;ed by a Work of three Ba&s;tions Northwards, and two ran|ging in the &s;ame line with the Wall of the Palace, and the Old City fronting the Haven. There is another little Fort N. E. of the Town again&s;t Incur&s;ions from the Mountains; and another upon the Ea&s;t-point of the Harbour. But this is only of Earth, and hath Five Ba&s;tions. On the We&s;t is a Hill unfortified, which commandeth the Town, and renders it very weak.</P>
<P>On the right hand, within the Mole, is a large Lazarett, as the Ita|lians call a Pe&s;t-hou&s;e; which are frequent in all the Cities of Italy, and under the Venetian Dominions. They are principally for tho&s;e that come from any place &s;u&s;pected of the Plague, e&s;pecially Turky, which is never free from it. And here new-comers &s;tay forty days to clear them&s;elves; which they call doing Centumaccia, or Quaran|tine, from &s;o many days allotted, before they can have Prattick, or any Commerce with the City. But this &s;erved in&s;tead of a Palace to en|tertain the Emba&s;&s;adour, and al&s;o for want of an Inn in the Town for a Lodging for us. It hath three Quadrangles, each le&s;s than the other. The Chamber we cho&s;e was the be&s;t of half a dozen, at lea&s;t of one &s;ide of the third Quadrangle. I &s;hould have been gladder, had we found nothing but the bare Walls, as my Comerade hath given an account. For we had both them, and the Floor, &s;o furni&s;hed with Chinches, Fleas and Emmots, that I (who u&s;ed &s;till to have the greate&s;t &s;hare in &s;uch Vermin) feared we &s;hould be devour'd before we parted thence, notwith&s;tanding all we could invent to de&s;troy them. This is a very commodious place for the Merchants, that come out of Turky in great Companies, which they call Caravans, both to lodg them and their Merchandize, which they unlade here, it being the chief Scale of Trade for Shipping of Goods from Turky to Venice. Our Beds were &s;uch as we had made at Venice, to lye on in the Gally, being our length and breadth of cour&s;e Ticking-Cloth, well quilted with Wool; which did us great &s;ervice afterwards in all our Voyage in|to Turky.</P>
<P>We &s;taied at Spalato eleven days, which gave us time enough to &s;urvey the place with more than ordinary diligence. But that which mo&s;t employed our curio&s;ity, was the Palace of Diocle&s;ian; who, when the weight of the Empire &s;eem'd unea&s;ie to him, cho&s;e this place to retire to, near his native City Salona. It is built of Free|&s;tone, well hew'n, and cemented together: the Figure is an Equila|teral &s;quare, each &s;ide containing two hundred paces in length, and the height that remains is above &s;ixty foot. It hath a &s;quare Tower at each corner, and three Gates, and with Mon&s;ieur Spon favour no more; that &s;ide towards the Sea, having none according to the be&s;t of my re|membrance; nor have I noted any more, in the de&s;ign I made of the Town, or in my Journal: The Gate, which entreth the Town from the Haven, being no part of the Palace: The other are placed in the middle of each &s;ide.</P>

<P>That &s;ide toward the Haven hath forty-five Windows, adorned with as many Pillars of the Dorick-Order, with Freezes, Architraves and Ba&s;es very well proportioned: Be&s;ides at each end one far larger, and higher than the re&s;t, with Three Arches born up by Corinthian Pillars of Marble. The Windows of the other &s;ides are not &s;et off with Pillars, but plain. The North-gate (which is towards Salona) was well adorned with Statues, as the Niches &s;hew. The weaving together of the Stones of the Architrave of the great entrance of this Gate is very pretty. This was for Hor&s;es and Carts to come in at. The two le&s;&s;er entrances, at each &s;ide of it, were for the people, on foot. I give you the Figure as well as I could take it. The We&s;t-wall is, for the greate&s;t part, razed to the foundations; yet what remains of the Gate, a&s;&s;ures me, that it was beautified with two Hexagon-Towers on each &s;ide; and hence examining likewi&s;e the other two, I judg'd, that they al&s;o might have been adorned in the &s;ame manner. Concerning the We&s;t-Gate, there is a way &s;treight thorough &s;everal ruins, &s;eeming apartments of the Palace, which leadeth to a Court about fifty foot long, and &s;even|teen wide, which I judge to have been the Center of the Palace, and equally di&s;tant from the Gates. This place, on the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, and South-&s;ide, is almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed with a Portico of Pillars of the Egyptian Granate-&s;tone, or a Stone very like it; of which I after|wards &s;aw a Rock in the I&s;land Delos; and &s;ince that, great plenty at Milan, about their Churches; which they dig out of a Quarry near Lago Maior at the foot of the Alps. They are of the Corinthian Order, well proportioned, and their Capitals of white Marble. At the South-end is a round Temple, like the Pantheon at Rome, who&s;e Fronti&s;piece wanteth not the Beauty of the more ancient Roman Ar|chitecture.
<PB N="18" REF="23">At the Ea&s;t-end is an Octogon-Temple, and oppo&s;ite to it We&s;tward a &s;quare one. The Plane of all which I here give, with its Dimen&s;ions, as I took them. The Octogon is now the Cathedral Church, dedicated to Saint Lucia. It is Eight &s;quare within and with|out, as I find it by the Dimen&s;ions, and figure I exactly took of it. It hath on the out&s;ide a Portic round it, Eight-&s;quare al&s;o, who&s;e curious - wrought Planches of Stone are &s;upported by Twenty-four Corinthian-Pillars of the &s;ame Granate with the others. Each &s;ide of the Portick, is of Fourteen foot long, and each of the Temples Ten. The door four foot wide, and is a&s;cended to by &s;everal &s;teps out of the Court. Within, it hath two ranges of Pillars, one over ano|ther; which placed in the &s;everal Angles, do make eight below, hold|ing up a Gallery; and as many above; four of which are Granate, and four of Porphiry; and all of the Corinthian Order. Under it is a Vault, who&s;e round-arched roof makes the floor of the Temple, which likewi&s;e is Arched, and built &s;o &s;trong, as if it were meant for Eternity. The round Temple hath a Fronti&s;piece, being the breadth of the South-end of the Court, which is &s;u&s;tained by four Granate-Pillars of the Corinthian-Order; the two on each &s;ide &s;u&s;tain an Archi|trave, on which is built an high Arch over the door; who&s;e two Lintel-Po&s;ts, and Tran&s;ome, are of three whole Stones, well wrought, but too high to be ea&s;ily mea&s;ured by me. Were they upon Salisbury-Plain, I doubt not, they would pa&s;s for &s;uch Stones, as we there won|der at &s;o much. Within this is the Rotundo, Arched all over for|merly, but now part of it is fallen to decay. The Four-&s;quare Tem|ple, oppo&s;ite to the Octogone, hath nothing of extraordinary; it receiveth light only by the door, and is now dedicated to Saint John Bapti&s;t; and here they Baptize the Children of the Town.</P>
<P>There are many of the&s;e Pillars of Granate-Marble lying here and there about the Town; and I was informed, that tho&s;e who have told them, have numbred, together with tho&s;e that are &s;tanding, a Hun|dred and fifty-four.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding our bad lodgings at night, we made a &s;hift to &s;pend the days with as much plea&s;ure as we could wi&s;h; &s;ome new curio&s;ity, or other, &s;till pre&s;enting it &s;elf to us; be&s;ides the great plenty the place affords of every thing that is good, made us eat and drink as well as the Cookery of a German Soldiers Wife (the only one we could find in the Town to do us that favour) could make us; and that at very rea&s;onable rates. For they pay not for Partridges above a groat, or five-pence apiece; for a Hare not much more, and Butchers meat not above a peny a pound. Here is plenty of little young Tor|toi&s;es, which they &s;ell very cheap, and e&s;teem good meat. But the Trouts that are caught in the little River running thorough. Salona are held exqui&s;ite, and were famous in the time of the Emperour Diocle&s;ian; who was &s;o plea&s;ed with them, that he made a Channel from the River to his Palace, there to pre&s;erve them. There is plenty of good Fruit here; the &s;ea&s;on then yielded Cherries, Mulberries, Figs, and abundance of Apricots; but of the la&s;t, I never found any &s;o fair, nor well-ta&s;ted as tho&s;e of England.</P>
<P>We had time not only to &s;ee the Town, but the places circumjacent
<PB N="19" REF="23">al&s;o. The fir&s;t excur&s;ion that we made was to &s;ee Salona, four miles or thereabouts, Northward of the Town, and thence as many more to &s;ee Cli&s;&s;a, thorough a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Country, full of Vines, Olives, Corn, Pomegranates, and other curious Plants.</P>
<P>Salona &s;eemeth to have been about &s;even or eight miles in circuit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salona.</NOTE> although they report it to have been more. It is now only Ruins, and Fields of Corn, as famous as it was in times pa&s;t, for making conti|nual War again&s;t the Romans. It was de&s;troyed by Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, among other Towns of Dalmatia, as Strabo affirmeth, but was re|&s;tored by Tiberius Cae&s;ar, and reduced to a Roman Colony, as a frag|ment of a Stone in the Steeple of Spalatro proveth.</P>

<P>It hath the Mountains of Morlachia North, &s;eparated by a little Gulph, which probably was its Haven, and helps to make the I&s;thmus. We&s;t|ward, by the&s;e ruins, runneth a little &s;tream into the Gulph, whence the Trouts are taken. This turneth two, or three little Mills; hard by which is a &s;mall Church. Our Guides &s;hewed us a Cave among the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uins, which they told us was the Sepulcher of St. Domnus, the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of Salona, and St. Peters Di&s;ciple, and not far from thence the Se|pulcher of St. Ana&s;ta&s;ius, and St. Rainerus, Bi&s;hops al&s;o of this place. Not far from the River are the Re&s;ts of an Aqueduct, ranged towards Spala|tro; perhaps the Channel, that conveigheth the Trouts, or water at lea&s;t, from the River to Diocle&s;ians Palace. We pa&s;&s;ed over this River North|ward to go to Cli&s;&s;a, four miles from hence, by the way that was an|ciently called Gabiniana, as we learned among &s;everal In&s;criptions that we found on the Steeple of the Dome at Spalatro, which was built out the Ruins of Salona. This way leads from Salona to Andetrium, and owes its being, as the Stone affirmeth, to the Munificence of Tiberius Cae&s;ar.</P>

<P>From hence we went to Cli&s;&s;a, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;trong Ca&s;tle Andretrium (<GAP DESC="foreign">) Strabo &s;peaks of, and that Ptolemy calleth Andecrium: But if it is, he is very much mi&s;taken in the Calcule, both of its Longitude and Latiutde.

This Stone al&s;o proves it to have been called Andetrium, rather than Andretrion, or Andecrium, Stones being le&s;s &s;ubject to be altered, than Books; who&s;e often copying may introduce faults, the fir&s;t Authors were never guilty of.</P>
<P>Cli&s;&s;a is a very &s;trong Fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cli&s;&s;a.</NOTE> and that more by Nature than Art. The &s;ituation is upon a long Rock, made in the fa&s;hion of a Gally; of which the Governours Lodgings at the North-end are the Poupe: It &s;tands ju&s;t in the middle of the pa&s;&s;age between the Mountains, who&s;e height and precipices are &s;uch, as leaveth no other entrance into the Inland-parts from the Penin&s;ula, but this. And this is &s;o narrow, that not a man, or hor&s;e, can pa&s;s by without the Licen&s;e of the Ca&s;tle. It was taken from the Turks by the Venetians, under the Conduct of Signior Fo&s;colo, who was then Proveditor of Dalmatia; and that as much by an accident, as by the vigorous a&s;&s;aults that were made again&s;t it. For after a long and fruitle&s;s expectance of Succours, and their Provi&s;ions failing, the Turks were frighted into a Capitulation, by a Granado, that fell upon the Mo&s;que, while&s;t they were at their De|votions, and did &s;uch mi&s;chief as quite di&s;couraged them from hold|ing out any longer. They therefore &s;urrendred on condition of free pa&s;&s;age with bag and baggage; which although granted by the Com|mander, yet was of little u&s;e to them. For the Morlachs, their invete|rate enemies way-laid them in their pa&s;&s;age, and cut all their throats, without his knowledge. It was a&s;&s;aulted from the We&s;t-&s;ide; where, upon a little ri&s;ing-ground under the adjacent Mountains, they rai&s;ed their Battery. They &s;ay, that it did formerly belong to the Emperour of Germany, and was built by a Queen of Hungary. Since the Ve|netians had it, they have blown up part of the Rock on the North|&s;ide, to make it yet more unacce&s;&s;ible. Other Walls it hath none, but the Rocks, and &s;ome few Mounds of Earth, without any regularity. On the top, which is very narrow, but long, I perceived &s;ome old Foun|dations of Walls, which, with an In&s;cription or two, that we &s;aw after at Trau brought from hence, made us believe, that it was a place of Antiquity. A Bow-&s;hot from hence, Northwards, we entred the Grand Signiors Dominions. There are two Companies of Foot, and half a Troop of Hor&s;e that guard this Ca&s;tle. But the greate&s;t part of the&s;e commonly quarter at Spalatro, now they have Peace; only a &s;ufficient number is left here to keep Guard. They have no Water but what falls from Heaven, or is brought up to them with much la|bour from a Fountain in the Village, under the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Another day we went to &s;ee a Convent, that lieth North-We&s;t of the Town, &s;ituate at the bottom of a little Bay of the Sea. It is called
<PB N="21" REF="24"><HI>Madonna di Paludi,</HI> or <HI>our Lady of the Mar&s;hes.</HI> It hath a pretty Church, and plea&s;ant Gardens. I think the Fathers are of the Order of Saint Antonio of Padua. Some time after we took a walk towards the We&s;t Promontory of the Haven, and pa&s;&s;ed along the Coa&s;t two or three miles. Fir&s;t by a Convent of Greek Monks, who&s;e Church is dedicated to Saint Hierome; and a good way further, towards the Cape, or Lands-End, of this little Territory, is a &s;mall Fort, not con|&s;iderable, which &s;erveth for no other u&s;e than a Watch-Tower. Re|turning, we made towards a Rocky Mountain Northwards, thorough very plea&s;ant Groves of Olives, that covered us from the heat of the Sun, which would otherwi&s;e have been very trouble&s;ome, from its re|flection upon tho&s;e Rocks in &s;uch direct rays. Here we climbed up to a Hermitage, cut in the Rock, which had two or three pretty Cells, but not very cleanly. Nearer the Town, I clambered up a high Rock, that commands it, to take a pro&s;pect of it with my Pencil; where I be|gan to wi&s;h that I had had more skill to have de&s;igned one of the mo&s;t delightful places that I had ever &s;een.</P>

<P>Growing upon the Steeple here, and on other hard Walls, I found a Plant, which I knew not how to call, unle&s;s <HI>Equi&s;etum Frute&s;cens.</HI> It is a Perennial-Plant, which hath a weak, long, and &s;lender Branch, in colour and &s;ub&s;tance like ordinary White Je&s;&s;amine, and without leaves; full of joynts, at about an Inch di&s;tance from each other; out of each of which, in the fa&s;hion of ordinary Hor&s;e-tail, round the joynt, grow other Branches, that run out a great length, and are joynt|ed like the fir&s;t Stalk.

<P>Having yet time to &s;pare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran.</NOTE> we hired a Boat, and went to Trau, accounted thirteen miles by Sea, and eighteen or twenty by Land, We&s;tward of Spalatro. We pa&s;&s;ed in a Channel between the &s;hore and the long Scoglio, or little I&s;le Bua; to the We&s;tern-end of which it is joyned by a Stone-bridg, and to the Firm-Land by a Woodden one: So that it is now an I&s;land, whatever it was anciently, and is &s;urrounded by the Sea; although its learned Hi&s;torian, <HI>Joanni Lucio</HI> proveth, that it was formerly a Penin&s;ula; and that the Channel, that
<PB N="23" REF="25">now &s;eparateth it from the Land, is done by art, and not by nature, again&s;t Strabo and Ptolomy; to whom it was known by the name of Tragurium.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation is very plea&s;ant, having good Gardens on the Land Northwards, and a hand&s;ome Bourg on the Scoglio South. The Dome is well built, and ancient. The Chappel on the North-&s;ide is &s;et round with Statues; of which tho&s;e of Saint Peter and Saint Paul are good. But the chief rea&s;on that made us take this days Voyage, was to &s;ee a Manu&s;cript, that hath made much noi&s;e among the Learned concern|ing its Antiquity; to wit, the fragment of <HI>Petronius Arbiter,</HI> which was wanting to his Works: Becau&s;e for &s;ome ages this piece had not been &s;een, it was held to be but the fruit of the brain of &s;ome inge|nious per&s;on, who had tried to imitate <HI>Petronins</HI> his Stile. Among others, Mon&s;ieur Valois was one, that e&s;teemed it fictitious: But Signior Lucia, and the Abbot Gradi at Rome were of the contrary opinion; the fir&s;t of whom had undoubtedly &s;een the Manu&s;cript, Trau being his native Country. The Manu&s;cript is in the hands of Dr. <HI>Statelius,</HI> a man of parts and learning, but &s;ickly; not a young man, as Mon&s;ieur Valois &s;tiles him, with more pride than good man|ners; for he is near Three&s;core years old, and a grave and &s;ober per|&s;on, who, it may be, thinks it not worth his pains to an&s;wer Mon|&s;ieur Valois, who&s;e arguments can be but of little force again&s;t the credit of &s;ight. The Remarks that I made of it, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>The Manu&s;cript hath Tibullus, Catullus, and Propertius at the be|ginning, and not Horace, as the Preface to the Padua-Edition affirm|eth. In Propertius is to be noted the <HI>Cognomen Nautae,</HI> that Scali|ger taketh notice of in his Notes.</P>
<P>After the&s;e followeth in the &s;ame hand, and on the &s;ame &s;ort of paper, eaten alike by the Worms, on the corners of the Margent, <HI>Petrontus Arbiter,</HI> as it is printed; who&s;e Title, written in red Let|ters, is as followeth.</P>

<P>Here we waited on Signior Dragatzo, Doctor of the Law, an ingeni|ous and civil per&s;on al&s;o; who &s;hewed us, in his Garden, and other places about the Town, half a dozen of ancient Roman In&s;criptions,
<PB N="24" REF="26">which he would have made a pre&s;ent of to us, could we have had con|venience to have tran&s;ported them. Hence we returned again to Spalatro the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;adour, being weary of the Sea by that time he arrived at Spalatro, re&s;olved to make the re&s;t of his Journey by Land, to the Grand Signior's Court, which was then at Adrianople.

<P>Le&s;ina is the I&s;le Ptolomy calls Pharia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;ina.</NOTE> and Strabo, Pharos. It is very high, rocky, and mountainous, and by computation a hundred miles in circuit. It hath a good Haven at the South-end, where the Town is called by the name of the I&s;le. It repre&s;ents the Form of a Theater; whereof the Town po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the place of the &s;pectators; yet appeareth mo&s;t beautiful to tho&s;e that enter the Area; which is the Port; being built in &s;everal degrees one above another, according to the ri&s;ing of the ground; having a Cittadel on the top of a &s;teep Rock, backed with exceeding high Mountains. It lies again&s;t the South, and hath a Harbour, &s;ecured from that Wind by the Roeks, that lie before it. They have beautified the Shore, on each &s;ide,
<PB N="25" REF="26">with a good Mole, made out of the Rocks, which there are in too great plenty. To conclude, it hath good Moorage, and is deep enough for Ships of any rate. Here is very good Bread and Wine, and good cheap I believe, for our Captain touched here to furni&s;h him&s;elf with Bi&s;cuit. Their greate&s;t Trade is Fi&s;hing of Sardelli; which are like Anchovies, and &s;ome think the &s;ame. In May and June they are caught here, and upon the Shore of Dalmatia, near L'I&s;a, South of this I&s;le, in &s;uch abundance, that they furni&s;h all Parts of Italy and Greece with them. The Turks take them as Phy|&s;ick, when they are &s;ick. They follow a light, and flock together about a Boat that carries it in the night; and &s;o are caught with great facility.</P>
<P>With no &s;mall difficulty I gat on the top of the highe&s;t Mountain, that overlooketh the Town, and was recompen&s;ed for my pains with an unbounded pro&s;pect. Hence I di&s;cerned a Promontory near Zara, which the Watch-men upon it a&s;&s;ured me was a hundred miles off. Hence Spalatro lies North Thirty miles, and Li&s;&s;a as much to the South. Hence Ships, Gallies, Barques, and other Ve&s;&s;els, are di&s;|cerned a va&s;t way off, by the Watch-men, who give notice by &s;igns to the Fort below, how many, what they are, and which way they fail.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal good Buildings here; e&s;pecially the Domo and Town-hou&s;e; and in a word, the &s;ituation is very agreeable.</P>
<P>In climbing up to the Fort and Mountain, I ob&s;erved, among others, the&s;e Plants:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Aconitum Lycoctinum, flore Delphinii:</HI> which I took to be a kind of <HI>Monks-head.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Aloe,</HI> in flower.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>A&s;phodelus Min. Junci folio, &s;eu fi&s;tulo&s;&acirc;, non bulbo&s;&acirc; radice.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Malva Romana rubra,</HI> or <HI>red Holihachs.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Juniperus Major,</HI> or <HI>Oxy-cedrus:</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Linaria tenui folio.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Geni&s;ta,</HI> or <HI>Spartium &s;eptimum Bauhini,</HI> as I believe. Its Root is thick, and of &s;ub&s;tance like <HI>Pimpinella;</HI> out of which &s;pring &s;ome half a dozen, or more branches, of a handful or two high, without leaves, of a light, green colour, and of a &s;ub&s;tance like Spani&s;h-broom, but beyond compari&s;on le&s;s: It &s;till divides it &s;elf into three twigs; &s;ometimes one of tho&s;e three points divides it &s;elf into three more. That which makes me doubt whether it be this, as Mon&s;ieur Mer|chaund of Paris hath named it, is, That the Root &s;eemeth hot, and of a &s;picy ta&s;te.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. <HI>Pilo&s;ella major pilo&s;i&s;&s;ima.</HI> This Plant is very like to <HI>Great Mou&s;e|ear,</HI> in leaves and height, being half a foot high, or more, and the leaves near as long. But the hair is of &s;uch a prodigious length, that it is to be wondred at; being little le&s;s than an Inch long, and very thick.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>We parted hence after Dinner, and arrived that evening at Cur|zola, called by <HI>Strabo Corcyra Nigra.</HI> This I&s;land belonged formerly to the Republique of Ragu&s;a, and was taken from them by the Ve|netians, by this plea&s;ant &s;tratagem. The Venetians had a little I&s;land,
<PB N="26" REF="27">called <HI>Saint Mark;</HI> &s;o near to Ragu&s;a, that it commanded the Town, and yet nearer a little Rock, that had no more plain ground on the top, then would be &s;ufficient to lay the Foundations of a little hou&s;e. Hither the Venetians, upon &s;ome high di&s;gu&s;t, &s;ent men one night, that built a little Fort of Pa&s;t-board, painted of the colour of Earth, which made it look like a &s;trong Rampart, and thereon planted Wooden Cannons, to the great amazement of the Towns-people next morning; which in effect put them into &s;uch a fright, that they &s;ent pre&s;ently to parly, and were glad to come off for the I&s;land of Curzola in exchange of that pittiful Rock. They &s;tood for the Sco|glio of Saint Mark al&s;o; but the Venetians would not part with that. And &s;o they lo&s;t Curzola, which is of great u&s;e to the Venetians, who come hither often to mend and repair their Ve&s;&s;els, the I&s;land being well covered with Woods. The Town is of the &s;ame name with the I&s;land, and &s;ituated upon a Penin&s;ula. They &s;ay, that the Walls of it were built by Diocle&s;ian. The Domo al&s;o, now dedicated to Saint Mark, is an ancient Edifice, and &s;tands upon an Eminence in the middle of the Town, where all the &s;treets meet. Upon one corner of the Front, on the top, is the Bu&s;t of a Woman with a crowned head. The people there believe it was Diocle&s;ian's Empre&s;s; to which my companion gave little credit, having never &s;een it, neither in Medals nor in Statue: But it is without doubt ancient; as al&s;o the Church, built of Marble, dug in the I&s;le: and &s;o are mo&s;t part of the Hou&s;es; but not poli&s;hed like the Palaces of Genua. It is a Bi&s;hops &s;eat, and governed by a Venetian-Count. There are five Villages be&s;ides upon the I&s;land, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to contain fourteen or fifteen hun|dred Souls apiece; but the City not above one thou&s;and. For the compa&s;s of the Walls is but &s;mall. The abundance of the Woods &s;erveth for a refuge for &s;everal &s;orts of wild creatures, e&s;pecially an Animal (as they &s;ay) made like a Dog; but which maketh a noi&s;e like a Calf, or Peacock. When they light any fire near the Woods in the night, they hear numbers of them howl together; which make a hideous noi&s;e: Tho&s;e that hear them, would think they were people that cry a-far off. Of the&s;e we heard many between Smyrna and Ephe|&s;us, when we had the misfortune to lo&s;e our way on the Plains, in a wet and thund'ring night, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion again to remem|ber. To the North of this place, on the Continent, runneth a long &s;lip of Land, which maketh a narrow Channel between the Main-Land and it, called Sabioneira; and thereon &s;tands a Town of the &s;ame name, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to this, belonging to the Republique of Ragu&s;a, where they have many delightful and fruitful Gardens, as we were in|formed.</P>
<P>This evening we advanced a little further in the Channel to a Con|vent of Cordeliers, called <HI>Madonna del Scoglio,</HI> upon the &s;hore of Sa|bioneira. It was formerly a Greek Church, but now belongeth to Latin Monks. It was robbed by the Turks about Ten years ago; who then carried away the Tabernacle, and took the Holy Sacrament, and trod it under foot; which was, without doubt, done in indignation to the Roman Super&s;tition; which is the cau&s;e that tho&s;e Infidels are &s;o &s;candaliz'd at the whole Chri&s;tian Religion, that they will learn Ita|lian
<PB N="27" REF="27">enough to upbraid the Franks (as they call all the We&s;tern Chri|&s;tians) with it. <HI>Canagli di Chri&s;tiani, fate il Ve&s;tro dio, e lo Mangiate.</HI> You ra&s;cally Chri&s;tians, who make your God, and eat him when you have done. But it is our duty, who enjoy &s;o much liberty, and have often the opportunity, to teach them, how to make di&s;tinction between the glorious light of the Go&s;pel we enjoy and profe&s;s, and the Ro|man Super&s;tition they with &s;o much rea&s;on abominate. The adjoyn|ing hill yields a good pro&s;pect, and hath on the top a little Church, dedicated to Saint Catharine. There you &s;ee the Sea on both &s;ides of this long Tongue of Land; which is plea&s;antly covered with Woods of Myrtle-Trees, that were then in the flower, and made the whole Air thereabouts mo&s;t fragrant. Here I &s;aw Aloes in the Flower; and I judge the Stems of it were five or &s;ix yards high.</P>
<P>The next day we &s;ail'd between Sabioniera, and the I&s;le Meleda, leaving Augu&s;ta more out at Sea between Curzola and that; and having pa&s;t &s;everal other Rocks, or I&s;lands we came to the Port Santa Croce, which belongeth to the Republique of Ragu&s;a, and is the be&s;t I had &s;een all along tho&s;e Coa&s;ts. The entrance into it is very good, and the Port large, deep, and &s;ecure, being every way Land-lock'd, by Mountains round it, covered with Vineyards, Gar|dens, and Hou&s;es of plea&s;ure, of the Raguzians. The City Ragu&s;a is very near, but not &s;een from thence, by rea&s;on of a high hill in|terpo&s;ing. We had not the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee it, becau&s;e we &s;u&s;pected it to be infected with the Plague, but pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ight of it next morn|ing. The Ragu&s;ians have not recovered them&s;elves yet, &s;ince the terrible Earthquake, that happened there about twelves years ago; by which the greate&s;t part of their City, and Citizens, were &s;wal|lowed up by the Earth. I heard a Seaman, that was then in the Port Santa Croce, affirm, that they looked every minute, when their Ship &s;hould have been &s;haken in pieces on the water; a thing not ex|plicable by any Phaenomena in nature that I know of. He told me al&s;o, that the water boiled like a pot; which was undoubtedly cau&s;ed by the vapours ri&s;ing from the Subterraneous Parts beneath the water. They here voluntarily put them&s;elves under the protection of the Turks, to whom they pay tribute for the &s;ecurity they enjoy. The next day we pa&s;&s;ed by this place, and Raguza Vechia (or Old Ra|guza), where is &s;uppo&s;ed was Epidaurus of the Ancients. Thence by Ca&s;tle-novo, on the Channel of Catoro; the fir&s;t place on the&s;e Coa&s;ts, that belongeth to the Turks. Here we put in at a Port, called Madonna de Janici, from a Chappel &s;o called on the &s;hore. From this place we had a good pro&s;pect of Ca&s;tle-novo, within the Chan|nel; which I took as well as I could.</P>

<P>Hence after dinner we &s;tood out to Sea, that we might &s;hoot the Gulph of Londrin; but &s;till within &s;ight of Land, until we had pa&s;&s;ed Budua, the la&s;t place of the Venetians on the&s;e Coa&s;ts, and Dul|cignia, which perhaps were tho&s;e which Ptolomy calls Bulua and Ulcinium. We had no &s;ooner lo&s;t &s;ight of the Dalmatian-&s;hore, but that we de&s;cried the Mountains of Macedonia. This Gulph was called anciently the Gulph of Apollonia, where Cae&s;ar e&s;caped nar|rowly with his Life and Fleet. It is a very dangerous pa&s;&s;age, and is above a hundred and eighty miles over. And therefore le&s;&s;er Barques are forced to make the compa&s;s round by &s;hore, as my companion did in his return, who hath given us this account of it. <Q>Going along the &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ulcinium.</NOTE> we &s;aw Dulcigno (in times pa&s;t Ulcinium) belonging to the Turks, which may contain &s;even or eight thou|&s;and Souls, and is an indifferent good Scale, that is to &s;ay in the Levant-language, a City of Traffique. The Franks have there a Con&s;ul.</Q> Next is Durazzo; which was the Dyrrachium of the Ro|mans, and is now but a Village, with a ruined Fort. At length we came to the Gulph of Boyana, with a River of the &s;ame name, that emptieth it &s;elf therein, and which was called Drillo in times pa&s;t. On the &s;ame &s;hore runs the River Pollona, to which the nearne&s;s of Apollonia hath given the name. The Water remaineth, but the Town is utterly de&s;troyed: and there al&s;o &s;tands Aulen, which by corruption is now called Valona. Thirty miles thence to Landward is a Mountain, where ri&s;eth a Fountain of Pitch, of which the Ancients make mention, and with which they caren Ve&s;|&s;els, being mixed with Tarr. The Rock Sa&s;&s;ino, about &s;ix miles from Valona, boundeth the Gulph of Lodrino to the South-Ea&s;t.
<PB N="29" REF="28" MS="y">Not far from Sa&s;&s;ino, North-Ea&s;t, are the Fats of Pi&s;caria, where they catch abundance of Fi&s;h. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ows they &s;alt and dry in the Sun; which maketh Botargo; and the re&s;t they pickle:</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing this Gulph, in the morning, as &s;oon as it was light, we perceiv'd a far off a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, that we took to be a Pirate; which as &s;oon as it &s;aw us, tacked about, and fled; and thereby confirmed us in that opinion, e&s;pecially &s;o &s;oon as we perceiv'd that he made towards Vallona. But we pur&s;ued them &s;o hotly, that in le&s;s than an hour we came within Cannon-&s;hot of them, and fired two or three &s;hot &s;o near, as obliged them to &s;trike &s;ail, and come by our Lee. It proved neverthele&s;s to be only a Barque of Cephalonia, laden with Chee&s;e and Oyl for Venice; who took us to be as very Cor&s;aires, as we did them; our Officers being &s;orry to have mi&s;s'd the Booty they expected; and the others glad, that they had e&s;caped &s;o well the dan|ger they fear'd, we, each of us pur&s;ued our cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t Sa&s;&s;ino we had the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e high Mountains, called formerly Acroceraunii, now called Chimera.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chimera.</NOTE> Towards the Sea-&s;ide there are five or &s;ix Villages, which defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Turks, and will not pay him the Carattle, or Tribute of Pole|money. The principal of the&s;e Villages is called Chimera, &s;ituate upon the top of a Rock, having Precipices on all &s;ides; whither all the Country-people retire, when need requireth. If they &s;hould be a&s;&s;aulted by Sea, they retreat into the Mountains, which are almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, and drive away with them all their cattel: But if they are &s;et on by Land, there are &s;o many narrow pa&s;&s;ages, that they may be able to defeat an Army, meerly by tumbling down Stones upon them. They have a Harbour called Porto-panormo. They follow the Greek Religion, and in Spiritual affairs are &s;ubject to the Arch|bi&s;hop of Janina, a Town in The&s;&s;aly, about two days Journey from thence. They are e&s;teemed good Soldiers, being de&s;cended of the &s;tout race of the Macedonians; and are as bad Robbers as the Mag|notti, who are come of the Lacedemonians: Two people, in times pa&s;t, equally famous for War, though now the off-&s;pring of both be as infamous for Robbery: For they &s;ay, They will &s;ell Turks to Chri|&s;tians, and Chri&s;tians to Turks. The Wind being fair, we &s;taied not at Sa&s;&s;ino, but &s;ailed on, until we came at the I&s;land Corfu.</P>
<P>Corfu was formerly called Corcyra,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corfu.</NOTE> as I find in many Greek Medals I brought with me from thence. An I&s;land of ancient Fame, which had, without doubt, the Emperour Septimius Severus, and his Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> for its Great Benefactors. For there is lately found abundance of his Medals, and of Julia Domna his Empre&s;s, and of his Son Antoninus Caracalla, and of Plautilla his Empre&s;s; and of Geta, his other Son, (who both &s;ucceeded him in the Empire.) Tho&s;e of Plautilla are rarely to be found any where el&s;e. Of which, becau&s;e I have &s;everal Medals, not ordinarily to be met with, and no-where printed as I know of, except by its Worthy and Nobly - de&s;cended Hi&s;torian, Cavalier Marmero, I &s;hall for the &s;atisfaction of the curious, here pre&s;ent the Rever&s;es of them to publick view.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t place we arrived at, is a ruin'd City, called now Ca&s;&s;opo; but anciently Ca&s;&s;iopia, famous for the Temple of Jupiter Ca&s;&s;ius: of which I have &s;everal Medals; e&s;pecially one, which hath Jupiter &s;itting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. 1, 2, 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> with the&s;e Letters about it, <HI>ZEUC KATCIOC;</HI> on the other &s;ide the Head of Apollo crowned, with an Olive-branch behind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&Kgr;&Ogr;&Rgr;&Kgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Agr;.</NOTE> and his Harp before, with the&s;e Letters, <HI>&Kgr;&Ogr;R&Kgr;&Ugr;R&Agr;.</HI> There is only remaining the Ruins of its Walls, on a Rock almo&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ed about by the Sea.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> And hard by it a Church, called Panagia, as they name the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, kept only by three or four Caloyers, or Greek Monks. This little Church is famous for a Picture of our Lady, to which they attribute Miracles, and whereof I had a mind to try the skill. The way is thus:</P>
<P>Strangers, that have a mind to know whether their Friends are alive or dead, go to the Picture, and clap a piece of money upon it, thinking of &s;ome friend. If the per&s;on they think of be alive, the piece will &s;tick fa&s;t; but if dead, it will drop down into a Sack placed un|der-neath: &s;o that, dead or alive, the Prie&s;t is &s;ure of the money. I applied &s;ome Farthings, which I had, to try how, and where they would &s;tick; but had no other thought, nor end, being before well &s;atisfied, that it was but a ridiculous jugling. Some of them indeed &s;tuck, but all to one and the &s;ame place; tho&s;e that were clapt on any where el&s;e, falling &s;till to the ground. The Picture is painted up|on the Walls, and is very &s;mooth and &s;hining; &s;o that I attribute the &s;ticking to &s;ome clammine&s;s of the Varni&s;h; which they take care, &s;hall never be wanting in &s;ome places of it. Among the Ruins of the Ca&s;tle, I &s;aw a va&s;t, great Snake; I believe above two yards long, and big as the &s;mall of a mans leg, of a dark brown colour; thicker al&s;o at the tail, than ours are; &s;o that I take it to be a different
<PB N="31" REF="29">Species from ours. I &s;aw another afterward of the &s;ame kind; but not &s;o big.</P>
<P>The next day, being the Eighteenth of July, we came to the City, now called by the name of the I&s;land. It is not a hundred years, &s;ince this City was nothing but the old Ca&s;tle, and the pre&s;ent Suburbs of Ca&s;tati. But now it is a good large City, and well fortified with Walls on the South, and two Ca&s;tles at the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Ends; though the &s;ide towards the Harbour be not &s;o well fortified, as not &s;o much needing it. It would be a Town almo&s;t impregnable, were it not for a Rock that &s;tandeth towards the We&s;t, and commandeth the adjoyning Fort, with a great part of the Town. The other Ca&s;tle, or Fort, &s;tands upon a Rock every way inacce&s;&s;ible, running out like a Promontory in the Sea. This is the place of Re&s;idence of the Venetian-Generals of the Levant by Sea and Land; and to whom, from the other Proveditours of Zant and Cephalonia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Appeals may be made, and a new Hearing had of all Civil Cau&s;es before him, as Chief Judg under the Senate, as well as Chief Commander of all their Forces. He who had this Command then, was Signior Priuli. We being taken notice of here for de&s;igning places as we pa&s;t, were taken for &s;pies: So that order was given by the General, that none &s;hould be admitted into the Forts; in&s;omuch, that we could not at that time well know their &s;trength. But as I returned, and touched here, I had &s;o much time as to &s;ee this Ca&s;tle; which is well provided with Ammunition and Artillery. To the We&s;tward of it is a large place, which they call the Splanade; from the middle of which be|ginneth a large &s;treet, that runneth We&s;tward thorough the City. On the right hand, in this &s;treet, &s;tandeth the Cathedral Church, dedicated to Saint Spiridion, fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of that place, who&s;e Body they are per&s;waded they have, and there with great Veneration pre|&s;erve it. They attribute to him the doing a Miracle about Thirty-five years &s;ince, re&s;toring the &s;ight to a blind man, who came, and prayed to him, pro&s;trating him&s;elf before his Body. And of this they keep an Annual remembrance ever &s;ince; which happened when we were here. They make profe&s;&s;ion of the Greek Religion; but are in mo&s;t things Latinized, except in Obedience to the Sea of Rome, the Infal|libility of the Pope, and the Proce&s;&s;ion of the Holy Spirit. They have not a Greek Bi&s;hop allowed them; but there is a Latin one, and a Protopappa Greek. This Church is well furni&s;hed with Silver Lamps; and one of Gold, given by a Gentleman of Corfu; who, by his Will, left Five thou&s;and Cichins (which amount to about Three thou&s;and pounds &s;terling) to buy it.</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal ingenious men, and moderately learned; e&s;peci|ally Cavalier Marmero, who hath writ the Hi&s;tory of this place in Italian; and hath a Collection of Medals; but mo&s;t of them, &s;uch as concern the Antiquity of the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He derives his name from the I&s;le Marmero, in the Propon|tis, of which his Family were once Ma&s;ters.</NOTE> He is a per&s;on of great Worth and Honour, both as to his per&s;onal Qualities, and his Extraction, being de&s;cended of the Family Comneno, Emperours of Greece. This little digre&s;&s;ion, Reader, I owe to this Generous Friend, who&s;e name I have rea&s;on to mention with gratitude.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
<P>The Protopappa, or Chief Prie&s;t, called Panagiotti Bulgary, is but young; yet Learned not only in Greek, but Latin. He gave us &s;ome Books of the Office u&s;ed in Honour of Saint Spiridion; with a rela|tion of his Life, to pre&s;ent to the Patriarch of Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>Hiera&s;&s;imo Machi, Abbot of Palaiopolis, is al&s;o a Learned man; who retired hither from Candia, after it was &s;urrendred to the Turks. He hath a Study of a great many M. SS; among&s;t which are twenty, never yet printed: as a Commentary of Origen upon the Go&s;pel of Saint John, Saint <HI>Augu&s;tin de Trinitate</HI> Tran&s;lated out of Latin into Greek; one of which I bought afterwards at Athens, among other Manu&s;cripts, and the Sermons of Ephrem, an ancient Monk. He hath printed a Dictionary Tetraglot, Ancient and Vulgar Greek, Latin, and Italian; as al&s;o a Sy&s;teme of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>He hath a Nephew, named Ar&s;enio Calluti, who is al&s;o Learned in Latin, Greek, and Divinity, and is e&s;teemed a good Preacher. He Studied at Padua, and is now fir&s;t Pappa of the Church Panthagii, or All-Saints, in Palaiopoli. Among his Books he &s;hewed us a Manu|&s;cript of Saint John Dama&s;cen, never yet printed as I know of, and is a kind of Epitome of all his Works. And another, being a Com|mentary of Ptocho-prodromus on the Hymns of the Greek Church. There are al&s;o &s;everal other Learned men there, as namely Dr. <HI>Cap|pello,</HI> young, but skillful in the Civil Law, and in other Gentile Learn|ing. He told us he had compo&s;ed a Dictionary in Vulgar Greek, Latin and Italian, more ample than any yet extant. The Doctors Ju&s;ti|niani and Lupina are likewi&s;e men of e&s;teem there.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget my good Friend <HI>Signior Spiridiani Arbeniti,</HI> who hath al&s;o a little Collection of very curious Medals, a great lover of Antiquity, and a very civil per&s;on. He received us with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s imaginable, taking the pains to &s;hew us all things that are rare in that place. Sometimes he went with us a foot, and at other times, when need required, furni&s;hed us with his own and friends Hor&s;es, and always favoured us with his good company.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;oil of Corfu is not &s;o fruitful, as to &s;upply the Inhabitants with Corn; but they are provided from the Continent; from which it is &s;eparated by a narrow Streight of four or five miles over, near to Ca&s;&s;iopa. It is neverthele&s;s fertile in Wine and Oyl, and all &s;orts of good Fruit. We had a pre&s;ent &s;ent us of Figs, Filberds, and Cur|rant-grapes, then &s;carce ripe; the Figs being a large, green kind, they call Fraca&s;&s;ans, having in the middle a round lump of Jelly, of the bigne&s;s of a Nutmeg, very delicious, and refre&s;hing in the heats of Summer.

<P N="1">I. He carried us one day to &s;ee the Ruins of Paloeopoli, the ancient Metropolis of the I&s;land. It &s;tood on a Promontory to the South of the pre&s;ent City, &s;eparated from it by a little Bay, of about a mile or two over. The abundance of Ruins and Foundations, which are to be &s;een there, do &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate it to have been &s;o. The ground it covered is almo&s;t an I&s;land, and therefore anciently called Cher&s;opolis. It had on the South-We&s;t a good large Port, for Ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e days; but now has hardly water enough for &s;mall Shallops. The mouth is narrow, and was &s;ecured by a Chain; the place to which it was fa&s;tened, being yet to be &s;een. There has been formerly an Aqueduct, to bring fre&s;h water to it, from a Spring, which we &s;aw by a Church towards the Sea-&s;ide; from whence the Water was conveyed by a Channel made thorough the Rock in Earthen-Gutters, of about a yard long, and an inch thick apiece, curiou&s;ly joyned to one another; whereof great quantities are found thereabouts. Be&s;ides abundance of Founda|tions of Temples, Arches, Pillars, and Marble In&s;criptions, have been dug up here, and employed to build the new Fortifications of the pre&s;ent City. Signior Marmero, in his Hi&s;tory, hath given a Plane of the old City; which is now covered all over with Olive-trees, and here and there an old Church &s;tanding among them: the two chief, that &s;till remain, are Panagia, of which Pappa Ulachi is Abbot, and Pantagi, whereof Pappa Canuti is Rector. The Portal of the fir&s;t, who&s;e Architrave is &s;u&s;tained by Corinthian Pillars of white Marble, hath an In&s;cription, &s;hewing that it was built by the Emperour Jovia|nus, after he was converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and had de&s;troyed the Heathen Temples: the meaning whereof in Engli&s;h is thus:

<HI>[J. Jovian, having received the Faith, E&s;tabli&s;hed the Kingdom of my Power, and having de&s;troyed the Heathen Temples and Altars, have built
<PB N="34" REF="31">to thee, O thou ble&s;&s;ed and mo&s;t high King, a holy Temple, a gift of an un|worthy hand.]</HI> It is built much after the ancient Greek fa&s;hion, with a Dome in the middle, and a Porch for the Catechumeni. The other Church is built much after the former manner, and hath an In&s;cription on it; which Mon&s;ieur Spon thinketh to have been made about the &s;ixth Century. Count Marmero hath taken the pains to tran&s;cribe and interpret it. It &s;heweth, that it was built by one Stephanus, Bi&s;hop of the place, for the remi&s;&s;ion of his Sins.</P>
<P>On the South-We&s;t &s;ide of Paloeopoli, about two or three miles off, is a Plain, well watered with &s;everal Brooks of fre&s;h water, which make the &s;oil fruitful. It is judged to have been the Gardens of Alcinous, King of this place, famous in Homer. It is called now by the Virtuo&s;i Chry&s;ida, and by the Country people Pezamili, from &s;ome Mills that are there. Here we were full of Homer, e&s;pecially his relation of the Kings daughter Nau&s;ica's adventure; who going to Bathe her &s;elf with her Attendants, met with Uly&s;&s;es ca&s;t upon that &s;hore by a Storm. My Comerade telleth us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. 12.13.</NOTE> that he had &s;een a Medal of this brave Dame at Balogna; which he hath cau&s;ed to be engraven as a great rarity. I have therefore thought it worth the copying al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of Corfu are of a very revengeful nature, never forgetting any injury done them; which is often the ruin of whole Families. For they e&s;pou&s;e the quarrels of their Relations, from gene|ration to generation, and per&s;ecute them, till one of the Parties, and &s;ometimes both, be utterly extinct. They them&s;elves confe&s;s and re|late mo&s;t barbarous adventures of this nature, that have happened in the I&s;land. One I remember, though not the names of the Actors of that Tragedy. There happened a quarrel between two families, upon no great occa&s;ion at fir&s;t; but at la&s;t was brought up to &s;uch a height, that &s;everal per&s;ons were killed on both &s;ides; e&s;pecially on his &s;ide, who was the principal party offended. This man, dying, left only a young Son; to whom, when he came to age &s;everal years af|ter, it was propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould Marry a daughter of his Fathers enemy, that &s;o all differences might be ended, and a la&s;ting Peace made between the two families. After much &s;ollicitation he agreed to it, &s;o that a Dowry was concluded on, and Married they were, with a great deal of &s;eeming joy. But not long after, having carried his new-married Wife home to his hou&s;e, and having thither invited her Parents, Si&s;ters, Brothers, and other Relations of hers, he per&s;waded them to &s;tay all night, and barbarou&s;ly Murder'd every one of them, Wife and all.</P>
<P>After we knew what Ships were determined to go to Con&s;tantino|ple, we went and waited on the General to de&s;ire his favour, that we might have pa&s;&s;age in one of them. They were in all &s;ix Sail; whereof Two Men of War, and a Merchant-man, were bound for Con|&s;tantinople; and the other, Three Men of War, no further than <HI>Tine,</HI> thither to carry a new Proveditor. The General, after a very civil Conference, gave us Warrant to Embarque on the Guerriera Con|&s;tante; being now informed that we were Gentlemen, and that it was meerly curio&s;ity that made us &s;o inqui&s;itive.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="31">
<P>The Twenty-fir&s;t of July we went on board, and &s;et &s;ail for Zant; but the Wind being contrary, and having but little Sea-room between the I&s;land and the Continent, our Boats were &s;o &s;hort, that we made little, or no way, until the Third day. The Wind then tacking about to the North, we &s;oon got out, and doubled the Southern Cape of the I&s;land; beyond which there are &s;ome Flats, and Rocks by it above water; called Paxo, and Antipaxo, by the Venetians; but by San&s;on, Pa&s;cu, &amp;c. Afterwards we left the I&s;land Saint Mauro, and be|yond that, Cephalonia, the chief I&s;land of Uly&s;&s;es his Dominions: of which before I &s;ay any thing more, Mon&s;ieur Spon mu&s;t give me leave to correct an error or two he hath committed, concerning Corfu, comparing it with Cephalonia, where he &s;ays, <HI>Afterward we pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ight of the I&s;land of Cephalonia, twice as big as that of Corfu: For that hath about an hundred and forty miles in circuit, and this not above &s;e|venty.</HI> Whereas Count Marmero &s;heweth, that Pliny counted Corfu Ninety-&s;even miles long, as he &s;uppo&s;es, taking the I&s;land Paxo with it, now di&s;tant from Corfu, ten miles; and he at pre&s;ent reckons it about &s;eventy miles in length, and twenty broad at the North-We&s;t end, and ten at the South-Ea&s;t. Whence he concludeth it a hundred and eighty miles about. But his Map added, and publi&s;hed with his Book, if mea&s;ured by his Scale, maketh it eighty miles long, and from thence ten to Paxo; which Scoglio perhaps makes the other &s;even mentioned by him. However I do agree that Cephalonia is the bigger I&s;land; for although it be not much longer than Corfu, it is as wide again.</P>
<P>Cephalonia is fruitful in Oyl, and excellent Wines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CEPHALO|NIA.</NOTE> e&s;pecially red Mu&s;catels (which we call Luke Sherry), and in tho&s;e Grapes whereof Currans are made, that yield con&s;iderable profit. The place of re&s;idence of the Proveditor is Argo&s;toli, where there is a large Port, every way Land-lock't, but hath no good Anchoridge. At the mouth of the Port indeed is another Village, called Luxuri, but not many Curran-Merchants re&s;ide there, as he &s;aith, for Zant is the place of their ordinary Re&s;idence, where they come yearly to buy up the Currans to tran&s;port. A little while &s;ince here happened a kind of Civil War between two families. They made a faction of fifty or three&s;core of a &s;ide; who gave combat to each other, and fought as bloodily, as Turks would do again&s;t Chri&s;tians. The Venetian Governours had not power enough to appea&s;e the quarrel. But after they were weary, they made peace upon condition, that the one party &s;hould not enter into the others quarters on pain of death. There is a Harbour on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, where we ca&s;t Anchor upon our return from Zant to Venice. It is called Pe&s;carda, proper only for little Ve&s;&s;els. There is to be &s;een here a little ruined Village, where nothing now remains, but a &s;mall Church, and &s;ome few Caloyers.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t Pe&s;carda is the I&s;le Thiaki, &s;eparated from it only by a Streight of three or four miles over; for which rea&s;on &s;ome call it Little Cephalonia. The likene&s;s of its name hath made it be taken for Ithaca, one of the principal I&s;les of Uly&s;&s;es his Kingdom, and is placed there by San&s;on and Sophianus. But they may be de|ceived.
<PB N="36" REF="32">For Strabo, &s;peaking of Ithaca, gives it but eighty Stadia about, which maketh about ten Italian miles: and this I&s;land is at lea&s;t the double. Therefore I believe, that Ithaca is another little I&s;land, &s;even or eight miles from hence, called yet Ithaca; which is much le&s;s than this; I believe anciently called Dulichium, becau&s;e it hath at the Ea&s;t-&s;ide a Port, with the Ruins of a Town called yet Dolichia, as Strabo ob&s;erved, it was called in his time; which to me is &s;atisfaction enough; though Strabo notwith&s;tanding &s;eemeth to favour tho&s;e that take Thiaki for Ithaca. But, perhaps, Strabo him|&s;elf did not know the true &s;ituation; the ancient names being in his time changed. For, la&s;tly, if we have recour&s;e to what Homer hath &s;aid of it, it &s;eemeth that Dulichium was none of the I&s;les Echinades, as the Geographers after-him have judged; however it is a que&s;tion not &s;o ea&s;ily decided. Two Engli&s;h Ships go yearly to this Thiaki, to lade Currans. The I&s;le is cultivated by the Inhabitants, who are reduced to three Villages, called Onoi, Vathi, and Oxia. In a Wood there are to be &s;een the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle; which the I&s;landers tell you, was the Palace of Uly&s;&s;es. As to the I&s;le Ithaca, it is de|&s;ert, and tho&s;e of Thiaki go thither to till it in its &s;ea&s;ons. The I&s;le of Cephalonia in Homer's time was called Samos, and had a Town of that name; which &s;hould not have been far from the Port Pe&s;carda, of which we have already &s;poken. Cephalonia was the greate&s;t I&s;land of Uly&s;&s;es his Kingdom; and I wonder that Strabo maketh it not above Three hundred Stadia in circuit; which amount but to Thirty-eight Italian miles; and Pliny no more than Forty-four miles; although indeed it hath more than a hundred and twenty miles in compa&s;s. But I will not find fault with the ancient Geographers, &s;ince our Moderns, who be&s;ide the old Geography, have the re|lations of the ages &s;ince, do notwith&s;tanding make mo&s;t gro&s;s mi|&s;takes in their Maps of the&s;e parts. Of Saint Mauro, he continueth thus:</P>
<P>Since we are in the Kingdom of Uly&s;&s;es, let us not quit it &s;o &s;oon, but &s;peak &s;omething of the I&s;land Saint Mauro.<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. MAURO.</NOTE> This I&s;land was an|ciently called Leucada; and the Modern Greeks call it &s;o yet: for the Ca&s;tle only is properly called Saint Mauro, from a Convent which &s;tood there, while&s;t it was under the Venetians. Returning to Venice we were obliged to touch at a Port of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIMENO.</NOTE> called Climeno, which is the be&s;t in the I&s;land, having good Depth and Anchoridge. From thence the phan&s;ie took us to go &s;ee the Fortre&s;s, and to that end took a Boat, called Monoxylo, to carry us thither. We rowed four or five hours in the narrow Channel, that &s;eparates it from the Continent, before we arrived at it. Strabo-&s;aith, that it was anciently joyned to the Land; and that this Streight was dug to &s;eparate it; which is likely enough. For in the &s;treighte&s;t part it doth not much exceed fifty paces over, and almo&s;t everywhere three or four foot of water. It is in this narrowe&s;t part of the Streight, that the ancient City, Leucada, had its &s;ituation, upon an Eminence a mile from the Sea; of which &s;ome Remains are yet to be &s;een; having for its Port the whole Channel, e&s;pecially tho&s;e Parts, where there was Water enough. Ortelius and
<PB N="37" REF="32">Ferrarius are mi&s;taken, in believing, that this City was, where now Saint Mauro &s;tands. They have not been upon the place, to find, that Saint Mauro is three miles from thence, in the middle of the Channel, where it is a League over. The Fortre&s;s is good, and hath &s;ome round Ba&s;tions, &s;ituated upon a very low ground. But that, which renders it con&s;iderable is, that it neither can be approached to by Land, nor Sea, unle&s;s in tho&s;e Monoxylo's, or little Barques, which draw not above a foot of water. It is &s;eparated by a ditch of thirty, or forty foot wide, from two little I&s;lands, which are as the Suburbs to the Fortre&s;s, and are inhabited by Turks and Greeks. Their Hou&s;es are very low, and built of wood: But to make amends, they them|&s;elves go very well cloathed, and are great Pirats in tho&s;e Seas. The Ba&s;ha of the Morea came thither this year on purpo&s;e, to burn their Galliots, or little Gallies; whereof Durag Beg, a famous Pirate of Lepanto, had formerly &s;even or eight under his Command. We left our little Boat a&s;hore, and went to Saint Mauro on an Aqueduct a mile long, which &s;erveth as a Bridge for tho&s;e that will go thither on foot, though it be not above a yard broad, and without any hold; which would make the &s;toute&s;t man tremble in pa&s;&s;ing it, e&s;pecially if he meet any other thereon. For it is as much as two can do to pa&s;s by one another. There is above Five or &s;ix thou&s;and Inhabitants in the Cittadel and Suburbs. But we had made but very hard cheer there, without the Fi&s;h we carried with us; for we found nothing there, but bad Wine, bad Bread, and wor&s;e Chee&s;e. There are about Thirty Villages in the I&s;land, inhabited by poor Greeks, that manure the Land, and catch Fi&s;h; Being under the Juri&s;diction of a Bi&s;hop, who&s;e Re|venues apparently are but mean. The I&s;le is fruitful enough in Corn, Oranges, Limons, Almonds, and Pa&s;ture for their Cattel; and is about Thirty, or Forty miles in compa&s;s. The Ca&s;tle of Saint Mauro is not above a dozen miles from the Gulph of Ambracia, now called the Gulph <HI>de L'arta;</HI> near which was the renowned City, Actium, famous for the Battle of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar again&s;t Mark-Antony; but at pre&s;ent there is no more talk of this City.</P>
<P>Not being willing to go thither, we di&s;cour&s;ed an Under&s;tanding man of L'arta; who a&s;&s;ured us, that L'arta, or Arta, was not Ambracia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">L'ARTA.</NOTE> as our Geographers do warrant. But that the City of Ambracia, which gave name to this Gulph, is above a days journey from thence; and is yet called by the Country people <HI>Ambrakia;</HI> though now but a Vil|lage about a mile from the Sea, ju&s;t in the bottom of the Bay. That there is a Kanne there, which &s;erveth for a Warehou&s;e, for the Mer|chandi&s;es, that are brought thither. That the Town Arta is at lea&s;t &s;ixteen miles from thence upon the River; which probably is the Ache|ron of the Ancients; and which according to Pliny di&s;chargeth it &s;elf into the Gulph of Ambracia. Vouro-potami is the Vulgar name of a River, which one pa&s;&s;eth, coming towards Ambracia, and is, without di&s;pute, that which in times pa&s;t was called Aracthus; although it pa&s;s not &s;o near the Town Ambracia now: perhaps, being bigger in old time, it extended it &s;elf even to it.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="33">
<P>The mouth of this Gulph is not above a mile and half wide, al|though it is above Three&s;core miles about. On the left hand there is a Fortre&s;s of Turks, not quite &s;o well peopled, as Saint Mauro. It is called Prevenza, and is the place of the ancient Nicopolis, built by Augu&s;tus, in memory of his Victory over Mark-Antony. In Arta are reckoned &s;even or eight thou&s;and Inhabitants; whereof the num|ber of the Greeks exceedeth that of the Turks. Signior Manno Man|nea, a rich Merchant of that place, told me, that the Cathedral Church of this place, called Evangeli&s;tra, that is, the Annunciation, is a great Building, that hath as many doors and windows, as there are days in the year, and that it is &s;u&s;tained by above Two hundred Marble Pillars. He added, that an In&s;cription over the door &s;heweth, that it was built by Duke Michael Comneno. This Town, and the Country round about, Traffick in Tobacco, Botargo, and Furrs; with which they drive a great Trade.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop of Arta made his Re&s;idence, in times pa&s;t, at Le|panto; which he now hath left, becau&s;e there are but few Chri&s;tians there. He had anciently eight Suffragans: But the Emperour John Palaeologus divided his Province into two Archbi&s;hopricks, to rai&s;e that of Janina. The Cities, that are left to Arta, are, 1. <HI>Ragous,</HI> a little Town, ten miles from Prevenza. 2. <HI>Ventza,</HI> a Town and Ca&s;tle, on the other &s;ide of the Gulph. 3. <HI>A&s;tos,</HI> an inland Town, two days Journey from Arta: and 4. <HI>Acheloou,</HI> which taketh his name from the River Acheloous. The Bi&s;hop of this place maketh his Re&s;idence at Angelo-Ca&s;tro; and hath al&s;o Zapandi, Ma&s;&s;a-longi, and Anato|lico in his Dioce&s;s.</P>
<P>Janina is a Town, bigger than Arta, peopled by rich Greek Mer|chants. Its Archbi&s;hop has under him four Bi&s;hopricks. 1. <HI>Argiro-Ca&s;tro,</HI> no great Town. 2. <HI>Delbeno,</HI> which is but a Village. 3. <HI>Bu|trinto,</HI> under which are the Villages of the Mountain Chimaera. 4. <HI>Glykeon,</HI> &s;o called from a River called Glyki: and this la&s;t Dioce&s;s is extended from Paramythia t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pourga, a Fortre&s;s belonging to the Venetians, upon the Sea-Coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. And thus far Mon&s;ieur Spon.</P>
<P>But it will not be ami&s;s (perhaps) to let you know, what the&s;e Boats, called Monoxyla, are, &s;o often made mention of. They are Boats made of the Body of a Tree, all of one piece, as the name implyeth, about fifteen, or twenty foot long, two foot wide, and a foot and half deep, or thereabouts. They were not unknown to the Ancients. He&s;ychius &s;aith, that the Cyprians called them <GAP DESC="foreign">, perhaps becau&s;e they were made of Oak, called in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">. Heliodo|rus al&s;o mentions Monoxyla in his Hi&s;tory. They &s;it in the bottom of them, and Row with two Padlers, or little Oars. Mon&s;ieur Spon &s;aith, he &s;aw two Hor&s;es pa&s;s in them over the narrowe&s;t part of the Streight, between the Land and Saint Mauro; which otherwi&s;e I could not have thought them capable of. I &s;aw them u&s;ed at Me&s;olongia, and Nathaligo, to carry Currans over the Flatts, on board Ships lying in the road before tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>But its now time to pur&s;ue our Voyage to Zant; where we arrived the Twenty-fourth of July Old, and the fourth of Augu&s;t, New Stile.</P>

<P>Zant is but a little I&s;land (I believe not above Thirty miles about);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zant.</NOTE> But to make amends, is one of the mo&s;t fruitful and plea&s;ant places I ever &s;aw. It lieth in 36 degrees, 30 minutes of Northern Latitude, South from Cephalonia, about ten miles and more, off the Morea near thirty miles Ea&s;t, and hath the Gulph of Lepanto N. E. In old time it was called <GAP DESC="foreign">, Zacynthos, as I have &s;een on &s;everal Medals; e&s;peci|ally on one, which I &s;aw in Sir Clement Harbie's hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. 14.</NOTE> the Con&s;ul of this place, who gave me leave to de&s;ign it. It hath on the one &s;ide the head of &s;ome Deity, and on the Rever&s;e Apollo's Tripos, under a ra|diant Sun, with the&s;e Letters about it,
&Zgr;&Lgr;&Kgr;&Ugr;&Ngr;&THgr;&Igr;&OHgr;&Ngr;.
The Greeks &s;till call it Zacynthos, the Italians Zant&eacute;, and we Zant. It hath been called by Boterus the Golden I&s;land; which it well de&s;erves, becau&s;e of the fruitfulne&s;s and plea&s;antne&s;s of its foil and abode. But it now more truly merits that name from the Venetians, who draw &s;o much Gold, by the Curran-Trade, from hence and Cephalonia, as beareth the ordinary charge of their Armada at Sea. It is governed by a Venetian Proveditor, and hath one good Port, though it lieth a little bleak to the North-Ea&s;t Wind; and another on the South-&s;ide; but is dangerous to tho&s;e that are &s;trangers to it. Between the&s;e two Ports runneth a long Promontory Ea&s;twards, on which is a high Moun|tain, called <HI>Madonna di Scoppo,</HI> from a Church there; where there is a Picture, that they per&s;wade them&s;elves works Miracles. The Town is &s;tretched along the &s;hore, and is very populous; as is al&s;o the whole I&s;land; wherein, be&s;ide the City, are reckoned fifty Towns and Vil|lages. The Town is backt towards the We&s;t with a Fort, &s;ituated upon a &s;teep hill; which ca&s;teth &s;uch a reflexion of the Sun upon it, as ma|keth it extreme hot in Summer, and almo&s;t an Engli&s;h Summer in the colde&s;t Winter. This Hill abounds with many Springs of excellent
<PB N="40" REF="34">good fre&s;h Water: which, although they ri&s;e, &s;ome not above twenty paces from the Sea, and others nothing near &s;o much; yet they are &s;o high above the &s;urface of the water, as may confute the vulgar error, that would have all Fountains to take their Original from the Sea. For here from high Mountains they powre them&s;elves into it, as from <HI>Monte di Madonna di Scoppo,</HI> the Fountain Grundinero doth. But if they under&s;tand that the Sun fir&s;t draweth the water out of the Sea into Clouds, and lets it drop down again in Rain or Snow, upon the Hills; from whence it collects it &s;elf into &s;ubterraneous Channels, and &s;o breaks out again in Springs, I will be of their opi|nion: But not that it pa&s;&s;eth from the Sea in &s;ubterraneous Channels to the Fountain, and thence back again from whence it came, above ground: Unle&s;s they fir&s;t prove, that in Water the contrary Qualities of Gravity and Levity cohabit together. This is plain al&s;o if we con&s;ider, that Springs are never far from &s;ome Hill, or Mountain. And that in many dry Summers, where the Hills are not high, and large they abate in their Water, and are often dried quite up: which could never be, if they came immediately from the Sea. For that is never wa&s;ted, at lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibly. We may therefore wonder, and adore the Wi&s;dom of the great Creator of All things, that hath laid the Earth in heaps, and hath lifted up the Rocky Mountains to the Heavens; which we ignorantly call Barren, and the Fable Mocks for only bringing forth of Mice: when they like good, though aged Fathers, fur|ni&s;h their children the Valleys with &s;uch plentiful &s;upplies of &s;treams, as render them &s;o abundantly fruitful, and their Fields to &s;tand &s;o thick with corn, and every thing el&s;e that is good and beautiful, that they &s;eem really to laugh and &s;ing.</P>
<P>The Town is well built of Free-&s;tone; but the Buildings not very high, by rea&s;on of the frequent Earth-quakes that happen there: which in the Spring are, &s;ome years, once or twice a week, and &s;o &s;hake all the hou&s;es, that the Stone-walls of them are all full of great cracks. One happened while I was there, at my return from Athens, during my Quarentine in the Pe&s;t-hou&s;e. That day it happened the Sun looked of a yellowi&s;h colour, which was looked upon as ominous. I was &s;itting leaning upon a Table; when on the &s;udden the Earth was &s;o prodigiou&s;ly &s;haken, that I thought the place (which was but one &s;tory high) would have immediately fallen on my head, it gave &s;uch a crack, and the Chairs, Stools, and Table &s;o cla&s;hed together, that they rattled again. The unu&s;ualne&s;s of the thing made &s;o deep an im|pre&s;&s;ion on my phan&s;ie, that I hardly believed the Earth &s;tood &s;till, &s;o long as I &s;taid on the I&s;land after it. But the Inhabitants are &s;o u&s;ed to them, that they make little or nothing of them.</P>
<P>They profe&s;s the Greek Religion, but are much Latinized in Do|ctrine, although they extremely hate the Roman Church. They are not allowed a Bi&s;hop, but a Protopappa; and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Bi&s;hop of Cephalonia. There is here a Latin Bi&s;hop; whom they are hardly con&s;trained to u&s;e civilly. A new one arrived while I was there; and when he made his publick entry, the Greek Prie&s;ts were commanded to attend him to the Cathedral Church in the Fort. He was likewi&s;e attended by the &s;everal Orders of Fryers, that have
<PB N="41" REF="34">Convents there; who &s;ung his entry after the Latin way: but were derided by the Greeks that followed them. They have a great many little Churches, both within and without the Town. The be&s;t is that of Hagia-panda, or All-Saints; which is &s;ituated in the place leading to the Mole. Its Pappa hath the repute of a learned man, and a good Preacher. He is of Candia, hath a good Study of Manu&s;cripts, which he brought from thence, and is called Pappa Agapito.</P>
<P>That of Saint Nicolo likewi&s;e is well furni&s;hed with the offerings of Seamen, and is &s;ituated upon the Mole.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Church of Saint Helias lieth above the Town, on the right hand of the way leading to the Cittadel. It is a pretty plea&s;ant place, &s;et round with Orange-trees; and is be&s;ide remarkable for the fame of Cicero's Tomb, which (as &s;ome have written) hath been found there, with an In&s;cription upon it, mentioning him, and his Wife Tertia Antonia; whereof now there remains nothing but the bottom of an Urn of Porphyry. Nor could we learn what was become of the re&s;t; there being none at Zant &s;o curious concerning the antiquity of their Country, as at Corfu.</P>
<P N="1">I. Towards the point that lieth oppo&s;ite to Cephalonia is a little Greek Church, called Santa Veneranda, about which the Engli&s;h u&s;ed formerly to bury their dead; but &s;ince upon &s;ome di&s;pute with the Pappa, they have lately altered their place of burial; it being made a mile or two off the Town, at a little Church in the Plain behind the Ca&s;tle. At the fir&s;t are &s;everal Monuments of our Engli&s;h Merchants, who have left their Bodies there; but few marks of their Religion are to be ob&s;erved, whether of the living, or the dead, in this, and in &s;everal other of our Factories abroad; to the great di&s;honour of the Reformed Religion; there being none to admini&s;ter comfort to their Souls, by preaching the Word, or admini&s;tring the Sacraments to them, when they are in health, or in the greate&s;t extremities of &s;ick|ne&s;s and death. For they have neither Church, Chappel, nor Prie&s;t. So that they &s;eem to the people of the place to live without Religion, and to dye without hope, as they really are buried without decency. This is a very great &s;candal to tho&s;e without; and therefore a very great fault in tho&s;e within our Church. You &s;hall no-where &s;ee a Fa|ctory of the Roman Religion, but they will have one, or more Prie&s;ts, when, perhaps, they are not well able to maintain them&s;elves. But ours on the contrary are rich, wealthy, and able to maintain many; but will keep none. I commend the piety of one of our Countrymen there; who, although he be not too great a friend to our Churches Di&s;cipline, yet hath offered to pay his proportion to the maintenance of a Prie&s;t of our Church, and to be his Auditor. But although this be the real fault of this and &s;uch other of our Factories; yet becau&s;e it gives occa&s;ion of reflection upon our Church, and the Ex|cellent Religion we profe&s;s, to its ignorant or malicious enemies abroad; it would, in my opinion, be a matter highly becoming the pious Zeal of our Reverend Fathers, to whom God hath committed the care of his Church, to con&s;ider of &s;ome proper Expedients, if any may be found, to prevent &s;uch Scandals, and &s;upply the defects of this nature in Foreign Countries, with whom we have any, although but &s;mall Commerce.</P>

<P N="3">3. There was, at that time indeed, at Zant an Athenian, called <HI>Demetrio Bernizelo,</HI> who hath the reputation of the Learned'&s;t Man among&s;t the Greeks. He under&s;tands the ancient Greek and Latin well, as al&s;o the Modern Greek and Italian, hath &s;tudied Philo&s;ophy and Divinity, and is permitted to preach, though he be not in Orders. He told us, that <HI>Hieromonacho Dama&s;ceno</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> was dead not long &s;ince, who&s;e Eloquence and Learning are much celebrated by Guil|letier in his New and Old Athens; to who&s;e Romantick Pen, the hone&s;t School-Ma&s;ter, I believe, was beholding, &s;ince his only Talent was to teach to Write and Read: which goes a great way in the Grecian Learning now-a-days.</P>
<P>This is now the chief I&s;land from whence the Currans come, where|of we make &s;o many plea&s;ant di&s;hes here in England. They borrowed their name from Corinth, the famous City near the I&s;thmus of Morea, and are therefore called in Latin <HI>Uvae Corinthiacae,</HI> or Grapes of Corinth. But none of them now grow there; being (perhaps) neglected, be|cau&s;e they have no Vend for them; the Turki&s;h jealou&s;ie permitting no great Ships to enter into that Gulph. They grow not upon Bu&s;hes, like our red and white Currans, as is vulgarly thought: but upon Vines, like other Grapes; only their leaf is &s;omething bigger, and the Grape much &s;maller than others: They are al&s;o without &s;tones; and in tho&s;e parts are only red, or rather black. But when I pa&s;&s;ed by Piacenza in Italy, I &s;aw White ones of this kind, only differing in colour. They grow in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Plain, behind the Ca&s;tle, encom|pa&s;&s;ed about with Mountains and Hills, which hemm in the I&s;land. This Plain is divided into Vineyards, mixed with Olive, Cypre&s;s-trees, and Summer-hou&s;es of plea&s;ure: All which from the Ca&s;tle, and the Top of <HI>Monte di Scoppo</HI> make a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect. In Augu&s;t, when they are ripe, they are laid thin on the ground, until they are dry: then are they gathered together, cleaned, brought into the Town, and put into Ware-hou&s;es they call Seraglio's; into which they are powred through a hole above, until the Room be filled up to the top. By their own weight they cake &s;o together, that they are forced to dig them out with piked Irons; and this they call Stirring. When they barrel them up to &s;end into the&s;e Parts, a man getteth into the Fat with bare legs and feet; and as they are brought and powred in, he &s;till keeps a &s;tamping and treading of them down, to make them lye clo&s;e together. They are worth here about Twelve Dollers the Thou&s;and, or little more or le&s;s; and pay as much to the State of Ve|nice for Cu&s;tom. The I&s;land beareth enough of them yearly to charge five or &s;ix Ve&s;&s;els: Cephalonia three or four, and Nathaligo, Me&s;alongia, and Patras one: of which &s;ome few are brought down from the Gulph of Lepanto.</P>
<P>To maintain this Trade, the Engli&s;h have a little Factory here, con|&s;i&s;ting of a Con&s;ul, and five or &s;ix Merchants. The Dutch have a Con|&s;ul, and one or two Merchants; and the French have a Con&s;ul and Merchant in the &s;ame per&s;on. The Engli&s;h have the chief Trade here; and good rea&s;on they &s;hould: for I believe they eat &s;ix times as much of their fruit, as both France and Holland do. The Zantiots have not long known what we do with them; but have been per&s;waded,
<PB N="43" REF="35">that we u&s;e them only to Dye Cloth with; and are yet &s;trangers to the luxury of Chri&s;tmas Pies, Plum-potage, Cake and Puddings, &amp;c. Among&s;t the Engli&s;h Merchants is Mr. Pendames, to whom I was much obliged; as for other civilities, &s;o for his courte&s;ie in &s;hewing me the I&s;land; and in it one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities that I have &s;een any where. It is the Pitch, or Tarr-Fountains of Zant. They are not above &s;even or eight miles from the Town: But we made, I believe, twice as far by Sea. For we had to pa&s;s about, from this Port, a long Pro|montory, &s;tretched out toward the Morea, and thence to return to the Port on the other &s;ide of it. In that Bay are two other little Rocks, or I&s;lands; one of which is called Marathrone&s;a, or the Fennel-I&s;land, from the abundance of that Plant, which groweth there, called in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">. In it there is only a little Church, with a Caloyer or two, who look to a Woman they pretend is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Devil. But, as my companion &s;aith, it is a fooli&s;h one. For it told us, that he was of Joadua, though it could not &s;peak one word of Italian; nor could it tell of what Country we were, or whether Married, or Bat|chelours; nor indeed make any pertinent an&s;wer, but &s;peak all in Rhime, but little to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pitch-&s;prings ri&s;e at the foot of an high Mountain, at the bot|tom of this Gulph, about a hundred paces from the Sea. The Pitch i&s;&s;ueth out of the Earth, with the water, in Lumps, or Balls, &s;ometimes as big as an Ha&s;el-nut, &s;ometimes as a Wall-nut; and ri&s;eth not pre|&s;ently to the top of the Water; but in a while after doth. It is like other Pitch in colour, but hath a &s;trong &s;mell, as near as I could gue&s;s, like Oyl of Amber. It is fir&s;t &s;oft, but by lying in the Sun grows hard. They gather about ninety, or an hundred Barrels thereof yearly: of which the State hath every Tenth, which they &s;ave as it ri&s;es, and Barrel it up, and the owners &s;ell the re&s;t for two Gazets the pound, which is not a half-peny Engli&s;h. When the Wind blowed We&s;t, that is, over the Mountain, at the foot of which this Spring lieth to the Ea&s;t; and when there are Earthquakes, it Vomiteth forth this Pitch in greater abundance, than at other times. Whence one may conjecture, that &s;ome &s;ubterraneous fire is the cau&s;e of it; which feeding upon &s;ulphureous and bituminous matter; what by rea&s;on of its &s;mall Vent it cannot devour, it &s;ends forth in this black &s;ub|&s;tance. The manner, that I have &s;een Pitch made, confirms me in this opinion: which is thus. They find &s;ome bank of ground, wherein they dig a hole about two yards Diameter at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e top, but very narrow at the bottom; into which they put the Wood of Pines, chu&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;appy, and cleaving them into &s;mall &s;plints; then place them an end, one above another, until the hole is full. When this is done, they &s;et all on fire at the top, which by the Wood burneth &s;till down|ward; and as it burneth, the Pitch di&s;tilleth to the bottom; and &s;o by a little hole is &s;aved as it i&s;&s;ueth forth. Thus may this great Moun|tain be compared to a great Pitch-pit.</P>
<P>In the Duke of Modena's Dominions, not far from his Country-hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, but nearer a Village called Sa&s;&s;olo, is a Mountain named Zebio, that &s;ometimes burneth out in a light flame at the top. like that of Ve&s;uvius and Aetna, but not with any great fiercene&s;s.
<PB N="44" REF="36">At the top is no hole to be &s;een, but only a place about a yard Dia|meter, filled with a muddy water, which continually boileth up in bubbles, &s;ometimes only of air, &s;ometimes of water, &s;treaked with a grea&s;ie, and &s;utty-colour'd &s;ub&s;tance. This Water is of a white muddy colour of it &s;elf, like the Soil of the Mountain, which is of a whiti&s;h Free&s;tone for the mo&s;t part. At the foot of this Mountain are two Springs of Oyl; the one of a reddi&s;h, and the other of a clear colour, like ordinary Oyl. Of this great part &s;weateth out of the Rock, and part i&s;&s;ueth out with Water, and is called <HI>Petrolium</HI> in La|tin, and <HI>Olio Di&s;u&s;&s;o</HI> in Italian. Both &s;mell alike, although they be not of the &s;ame colour; and both of the &s;ame &s;mell with this of Zant. The &s;ubterraneous fire is undoubtedly the rea&s;on of this; and that it is clearer, and thinner of &s;ub&s;tance, may be, by rea&s;on that it is Fil|trated thorough a more conden&s;ed matter, than that of Zant: But this is not peculiar to hot Countries, for I received lately from Scotland an account of a Well of Oyl, not far from Edenburgh, with a bottle of the &s;ame Oyl from my Worthy Tutor, Dr. Hicks, Chaplain to his Grace the Duke of Lauderdale. This is of a black colour, like that of Zant, but is thinner; the &s;mell neither &s;o grateful, nor &s;o &s;trong.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the Curran-Grapes, whereof I have already &s;poken, and which are now ripe, the I&s;land affords other Vines, that yield good, though very &s;trong Wine; but which bears water &s;o well, that it may be made as &s;mall as Venetian Garbo, and yet better ta&s;ted, and as brisk. The red Wine endures the Sea very well; but the Muskatels not; though they are very delicious, and in great plenty here. They make al&s;o abundance of excellent Oyl; but it is not permitted to be Exported by Foreigners, no more than the Wine: only what the I&s;land can &s;pare, is &s;ent to Venice.</P>
<P>Here are the be&s;t Mellons (I dare confidently &s;ay) in the World, if I may compare them with what I have eaten in England, France, Italy, and Turky. They are e&s;pecially of Two kinds, White and Yellow. The White hath its Pulp of a pale, green colour, and has a perfumed ta&s;te and &s;mell, as if they were &s;ea&s;oned with Amber|grea&s;e. Their &s;hape is not &s;o long, or oval, as ours commonly are, but a &s;hort, and flat round, in &s;hape of a Boul: nor are the Ribs covered with &s;uch a Fret work, but &s;mooth. The Yellow ones are like the White for &s;hape, and are not known from them, until opened: but are not e&s;teemed quite &s;o good. The Peaches here are extraordi|nary good, and big, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ghing from ten, to fifteen, or &s;ixteen Ounces. Here are al&s;o Citrons, Oranges and Lemons in abundance. One &s;ort of Lemon is very extraordinary, and &s;eldom &s;een in England. For be&s;ide their largene&s;s, and thinne&s;s of skin, filled with excellent &s;harp juice, they are without either &s;eed, or &s;tone. Here are al&s;o abun|dance of curious Plants.</P>

<ITEM>1. <HI>Geni&s;ta, &s;eu Spartium,</HI> a &s;mall &s;hrub, growing on the Cliffs, bearing many Silver-colour'd leaves, on little Twigs; which are &s;uc|ceeded with a knot of &s;mall Golden flowers; who&s;e little cod, or &s;eed,
<PB N="45" REF="36">being pa&s;s'd, the twigs that remain become &s;harp thorns.</ITEM>

<ITEM>5. <HI>Go&s;&s;ipium.</HI> Here I fir&s;t &s;aw the Cotton Plant grow; which is an Annual lant, &s;own in Fields, as we do Hemp and Flax; but altoge|ther unlike them. It hath a Stalk a foot high, be&s;et with leaves like Maple, divided into three, &s;ometimes four parts; from among which leaves come yellow flowers, like Mallows, or Holly-hacks in &s;hape, &s;et in a cup, con&s;i&s;ting of three green leaves, nipped about the edges. This, the flower being pa&s;t, filleth it &s;elf up with a &s;hell, like a Nut, crouded full of Cotton, with two or three round &s;eeds in it.</ITEM>

<P>July the Twenty-eighth, after four days &s;tay at Zant, we went aboard again our former Ship, called the Guerriera Co&s;tante, Com|manded by Captain Zoane Bronze, Native of Pera&s;to, a Town in Albania. He was formerly a Pirate, and for his Valour well known, and feared by the Turks, and reverenced by the Cor&s;airs. He is e&s;teemed one of the &s;toute&s;t Soldiers the State of Venice hath in its &s;ervice. They tell of him, that in his younger days he was at Pera&s;to, on a time when it was a&s;&s;aulted by a party of Two thou&s;and Turks, and they in the Town not above Fifty-nine per&s;ons: yet for all that they made &s;uch vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, that they &s;lew a great part of the Turks, razed their Batteries; and in conclu&s;ion, made &s;uch a Valo|rous Excur&s;ion upon them, as made them de&s;i&s;t from their enter|prize.</P>
<P>By a North-wind we put out, and left the Promontory <HI>di Scoppo</HI> on the right hand; but not without &s;aluting the holy Image on the top of it, for luck &s;ake. Not long after we pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;les Strophades, called now Strovadi, or Strivalli, thought by the ancient Poets to be the refuge of the Harpies. They are judged about Fifty miles from Zant, and Thirty from the Morea, very low, and the bigge&s;t not above
<PB N="46" REF="37">Five miles in circuit: Neverthele&s;s they report, that there is &s;uch plenty of fre&s;h water there, that one cannot thru&s;t a &s;tick into the ground, but water gu&s;heth out in the place; which makes them very fertile. They al&s;o &s;ay, that in the Fountains of this I&s;le are often found Plane-tree leaves; though none grow upon the place, but only in the Morea: which makes them believe, and not without rea&s;on, that their Original is from thence, and by &s;ubterraneous Channels they are brought thither. Here is a Covent of about fifty, or &s;ixty, Greeks in it; who defend their miraculous Madonna, by &s;everal Ba&s;tions, planted with good Canons, for fear of the Cor&s;airs; though they &s;ay, the very Turks of Barbary have a re&s;pect for tho&s;e Reverend Fathers, and &s;eldom put a &s;hore here, but to take in fre&s;h water. For great Ships they report it to be inacce&s;&s;ible, except in very moderate and calm weather; there being &s;o many Flats about it, and no &s;helter for them.</P>
<P>About Three&s;core miles further we doubled the Cape Sapienza, an|ciently called on the We&s;t-&s;ide Coriph Promontorium, on the Ea&s;t Acriti Promontorium; before which lie, in a row, the little I&s;lands Sapienza, Carrera, and Venetica, well known to the Pirates of Bar|bary, who u&s;e to skulk with their Ve&s;&s;els behind them, attending the Barques that come out of the Gulph of Venice, and others which they can ma&s;ter, bound that way for the Levant. We were not far from the&s;e I&s;lands, pa&s;&s;ing the Gulph Corone, called formerly Sinus Me&s;&s;e|niacus, when a Saylor from the Main-top-Ma&s;t made Ten Sail of great Ships, &s;teering the &s;ame cour&s;e as we did. Upon this we fired a Gun to give notice to the Commander of our Di&s;covery, hoi&s;ting and low|ring ten times our En&s;ign, to denote the number of Sail. He imme|diately &s;pared Sail, and made as little way as was convenient, con|&s;idering a fair Nor-We&s;t Wind; which we had almo&s;t a poop. The like we did, and with all &s;peed prepared for an Engagement; knock|ing down all the Cabbins, and throwing Che&s;ts and Hammocks into the Hold. They loaded the Guns, put out the wa&s;t-cloaths, and quar|tered the Soldiers in their &s;everal Po&s;ts, being as yet uncertain, whe|ther they were friends, or enemies. They &s;u&s;pected them to be Alge|rines, or &s;ome other Fleet of African Pirates. Some feared they were French-men, in whom they had no great confidence; becau&s;e they had lately denied &s;ome of the French Kings Ships, coming from Me|&s;ina, liberty to take in Provi&s;ion at Zant; and therefore they knew not how it might be re&s;ented. However, whether Friends, or Enemies, they thought it not &s;afe to tru&s;t either, whereby they might be &s;ur|prized. It was three hours before they came up to us, although they made all the Sail they could: which made us believe, that they were either Dutch or Engli&s;h Merchant-men, (feeing they were &s;o flow) and not Pirates, or Men of VVar; who u&s;e to be better Sailers. But at length, when they came nearer, we di&s;cerned them to be Hollanders by their En&s;igns, which were &s;triped of Blew, VVhite, and Red. Thus all our great preparations for fight ended in amicable &s;alutes to each other, expre&s;&s;ed by &s;ound of Trumpets, Drums, and Cannon. Our Admiral carried the Banner of Saint Mark upon his Main-Top-Ma&s;t, as Capitan Denavi; which is the highe&s;t Charge at Sea under

Their Admiral was young <HI>De Ruiter;</HI> who only as Vice-Admiral of that Squadron, carried his Flag on the Top-Ma&s;t head. His Ship pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t, and all the re&s;t in order after him &s;alu|ting; which we &s;till an&s;wered with the &s;ame re&s;pect.

<P>We were becalmed that night, &s;o that we found our &s;elves next morning in the &s;ame Gulph &s;till oppo&s;ite to Corone. But a moderate gale ari&s;ing with the Sun, not long after we doubled the Cape Me|tapan, called in old time <HI>Promontorium Taenarium.</HI> The Bay beyond it is called <HI>Brazza Dimagnio,</HI> from the City <HI>Magnia,</HI> &s;ituated at the bottom thereof. The Magnoti, who are the Inhabitants of that Coun|try, are famous Pirates by Sea, and Pe&s;tilent Robbers by Land. They have always bravely defended them&s;elves again&s;t the Turks, and main|tained their Liberty, till lately by this &s;tratagem the Turks were too hard for them. They got their con&s;ent to build two Forts upon their Coa&s;ts; which they did &s;o advantageou&s;ly, as &s;oon made them Ma|&s;ters of their City, and them. And now none of them are exempted from paying Tribute, but a few in the Mountains. And &s;ome have quit their Country, and are retired into Ponglia, where the King of Spain hath a&s;&s;igned them an habitation. They are naturally &s;uch Thieves, that when any Ve&s;&s;el cometh into their Harbour, they will go by night, and cut the Cables of their Ships, when they can find nothing el&s;e to lay hold of; which &s;ometimes endangers the Ve&s;&s;els running a &s;hore, when not di&s;cover'd in time. Some Mariners of this place, that were on board of us, gave us this account of their Country, with many diverting Stories of the &s;ame nature; which they glory in. One of the Officers of our Ship, who had been at the Town, related a Story, that well expre&s;&s;eth their Thieving nature. Some &s;trangers being at one of the Villages of the&s;e Magnoti, cau&s;ed their Baggage to be brought into an old Womans hou&s;e, whil&s;t they baited them|&s;elves, and their Hor&s;es: But &s;oon after their Ho&s;te&s;s fell bitterly a weeping. The &s;trangers &s;urprized at it, began to enquire the rea&s;on. Then one of them an&s;wering for her, &s;aid, That perhaps it was, becau&s;e the &s;ight of other Country-men put her in mind of the mi&s;erable e&s;tate of the Magnoti were reduced unto. But &s;he made them this &s;hort reply, and told them <HI>it was fal&s;e; her weeping was becau&s;e her Son was not at home, to rob them of their baggage.</HI> Such plea&s;ant Conferences as the&s;e made our time &s;eem le&s;s tedious, whil&s;t our &s;low pa&s;&s;ing of this Gulph made it the Fourth day from Zant to Cerigo.</P>
<P>Cerigo hath the Morea North of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CERIGO.</NOTE> and was called anciently Ci|thaera; famous for being the Native Country of Venus and Helena: So that were we to frame an Idea of this place from the fame of the&s;e Beauties, we might imagine it one of the mo&s;t charming places of the World. But, on the contrary, the greate&s;t part of it is a barren, rocky, and Mountainous Soil, ill peopled, and can brag of no plenty, neither of Corn, Wine, nor Oyl: which undoubtedly made Venus change her own Country for Cyprus; and Helena &s;o willing to be &s;tollen and carried into the plea&s;ant Plains of the Continent. What
<PB N="48" REF="38">Beauties it now produceth, I am ignorant of; for I remember not that I &s;aw a Woman there. Its plenty con&s;i&s;ts in Mutton and Fowls, as Turtles (Venus beloved Birds) Quails and Partridges. Abundance of Hares and Falcons breed here; but the people, for what I could under|&s;tand, addict not them&s;elves to Hawking.</P>
<P>The chief Town and Fort lieth on the South-&s;ide of the I&s;land, &s;trong only towards the Sea; on which it looketh from a Precipice. Under it is a Harbour, but open to the Southerly VVinds. Upon our entry in|to the Port, whether by neglect, or unskilfulne&s;s of our Captain, we ran foul of another Ship of our company; and if we did not endanger, did at lea&s;t con&s;iderable damage to both. It hath, about three or four miles South, a little Rock, called the <HI>Ovo,</HI> or Egg; the top of which they &s;ay is covered with Scorzonera, and is inhabited only by Falcons, that breed there. From the Fort al&s;o is to be &s;een Cerigotto, another little I&s;land, inhabited only by VVild Goats. It belonged to Colo|nel Macarioti, who &s;erved in Candia, before it was taken. He is re|ported to have behaved him&s;elf at that Siege very gallantly. He made us ta&s;te of very good VVine of Cerigo, where he now liveth. From Cerigo, in clear and fair weather, Candia may be &s;een beyond Ceri|gotto.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is &s;till under the Dominion of the Venetians, who &s;end a Proveditor thither.</P>
<P>Our Ve&s;&s;el parted hence before the re&s;t, to take in fre&s;h water at Port Saint Nicolo, which lieth on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of this I&s;land; and is undoubtedly that, for which Strabo &s;aith, <HI>The I&s;land hath a good Har|bour;</HI> there being, be&s;ide the Harbour for great Ve&s;&s;els, a natural Creek in the Rocks, large enough for Forty Gallies; which may ea&s;ily be tied together, and &s;ecured from without with a Chain. Near the Shore here digging, you have very good VVater: which is indeed from a little Rivolet, that in the heat of Summer &s;eems perfectly dry in the Channel; but &s;till pre&s;erves it &s;elf &s;ome three foot under the ground. VVe found ancient Ruins near this place; which we took to be the Ruins of Menelaus his City, in old time King of this I&s;le. They are almo&s;t level with the ground. Among the&s;e Ruins are &s;ome Grotto's cut out of the Rock; which one of the I&s;land pretending to be an An|tiquary, a&s;&s;ured us were anciently the Baths of Helena; affirming, that her Palace was not above three or four miles from thence on the Hills. VVe took this Antiquary for our guide, and went to &s;ee what we could find of it. But all we di&s;cover'd, were two Pillars &s;tanding upright, but without Chapitars; and the Ba&s;es &s;o deep in the ground, that we could not judge of what order they were. They were neither Chanell'd, nor altogether plain; but their Fu&s;ts cut into Angles, about the breadth of an u&s;ual Channel; and that not the whole length of their Fu&s;ts, but &s;ome proportionable part only. I rather believe it to have been &s;ome ancient Temple, than a Palace. They now call the place Paleo-Ca&s;tro, or Old Ca&s;tle. The &s;ituation of it is &s;uch, that it looketh over the be&s;t part of the I&s;land, having a good fruitful Valley on the VVe&s;t, and another, not barren, on the Ea&s;t, toward the Sea|&s;ide. I went up a little higher a &s;impling; but di&s;cerning the re&s;t of our Fleet under Sail, and our Ship ready to put out, it not only &s;poiled that
<PB N="49" REF="38">&s;port, but made me like to break my neek, in ha&s;tening down to give my companion notice of it; and for all the &s;peed and diligence we could u&s;e, we were like to have been left behind. But this ha&s;te &s;hall not make me forget to tell, what curious Plants I found upon this I&s;land, now I am more at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I heard <HI>Dictamnus Creticus</HI> groweth here; but I found none but <HI>Dictamnus fal&s;us,</HI> they call <HI>de Cerigo,</HI> in great abundance; which differeth from that we call &s;o here, though not unlike it. The chief difference is in its Flowers, which are of a purple and white colour, coming out of a wide cup, as broad as a Silver two-pence. The leaves are al&s;o broader and rounder, and of a very thick hoary &s;ub&s;tance. I brought &s;eed of it; and it grows in the Gardens of Oxford and Paris. I found two more, which I took to be <HI>Dictamnus Creticus;</HI> but after found my error. The fir&s;t hath a large, thick and woolly Oval-leaf, &s;et by pairs on a woolly &s;talk, of a handful high; which ends in a &s;pike of &s;mall purple flowers, like a kind of Galiop&s;is, and grows in round bunches together upon the &s;ides of the Rock. The other I believe to be <HI>Chamaedrys Alpina, minima, hir&s;uta,</HI> de&s;cribed the <HI>4th in Prodromo Bauhini.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd kind of <HI>Thymus Capitatus,</HI> differing in the leaves; which are &s;maller, and grow in little Tufts together.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is great plenty of <HI>Tragoriganum;</HI> which is a mo&s;t Odorife|rous Plant, &s;omething like <HI>Winter-Savoury.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Salvia Pomifera, &s;ive Gallifera,</HI> Sage bearing Apples, or Galls. The leaves are a&s;h-colour'd, and &s;mell very &s;trong.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Stoechas Citrina,</HI> with yellow Flowers, which hold their colour for many years, and are pretty in pots in the Winter.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Fifth we parted from Cerigo; and doubling the Cape Saint Angelo, we pa&s;&s;ed within &s;ight of Malva&s;ia, a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, built upon a Rock on the &s;hore of Morea, or Pelopone&s;us. Then having pa&s;&s;ed Bella-pola on the right, or, as &s;ome call it, I&s;ola Brugiata, (becau&s;e blown up, and burnt not many years &s;ince by &s;ubterraneous fires) and Carabia on the left: (<GAP DESC="foreign">, which is a much as to &s;ay the Ship-I&s;land.) We left on our right hand Antemilo, and further off Milo, which is reported to have one of the be&s;t Ports in the World, and now a refuge for the Cor&s;airs. Afterwards the Wind being North|ward, we weather'd the I&s;le Falconeira; which <HI>Petro della Valle</HI> thinks to be called &s;o from the abundance of Falcons breeding there. But they are not &s;aid to be more numerous in that place, than in the re&s;t of the I&s;les of the Archipelago. We pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ight of Argentera, called by the Greeks <GAP DESC="foreign">. They &s;ay, it hath a Mine of Silver, and &s;ome Inha|bitants. The name, which the Greeks &s;till retain, &s;heweth it to be the &s;ame, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tolomy and Strabo call <GAP DESC="foreign">; wherein our Modern Geo|graphers have been mi&s;taken, calling &s;ometimes Polino, and &s;ome|times Sicandro, by that name. Afterwards we pa&s;&s;ed by Siphanto; which hath ten Villages, celebrated for excellent Fruits, and beautiful Women. It hath al&s;o a great Mona&s;tery; where the greate&s;t part of the Greek Nuns go to initiate them&s;elves. A great way Ea&s;tward we di&s;cerned Paros, Renowned for its excellent White Marble; which after was &s;o improved by the excellent Workman&s;hip of Phidias and
<PB N="50" REF="39">Praxitiles; that of a Rock it became the objects of their Divine Wor|&s;hip, and honoured with the names of their fal&s;e Gods. It was an|ciently dedicated to Bacchus, becau&s;e of its plenty of excellent Wines; which there is not worth above a Shilling the Barrel. With this I&s;land Mon&s;ieur Nantuille, then Emba&s;&s;ador for the King of France, was extremely plea&s;ed, and gave us, when we waited on him, a very good account, and an excellent De&s;cription thereof. But that which I retain be&s;t in memory, is the account he gave of the Grotto's under the Marble-Mountains there: e&s;pecially of one, which openeth on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Rocks, and who&s;e entrance &s;eemeth to have been by art hewen out of the Marble. It is three &s;quare within, and hath about the Walls &s;ome In&s;criptions; but &s;o defaced, that nothing can be made of them. Streight forwards, within this, is another little entrance, leading downwards; &s;pacious within, but dark; which by Candle and Torch-light, pre&s;ented to their view one of the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Scenes he ever beheld in all his Travels: and the more &s;urprizing, in that it was the &s;ole contrivance, and workman&s;hip of nature; <HI>viz.</HI> the Figures of all &s;orts of Woods, Groves, Trees, Pillars, and a thou|&s;and Poetical phan&s;ies, formed by the falling drops of water congealed into Marble, of a &s;udden pre&s;enting them&s;elves to his &s;ight, as if en|chanted into this order by the harmonious &s;ound they make in falling.</P>
<P>Some few paces within this Grotto is a place, fa&s;hioned like an Al|tar, with &s;everal lovely Scenes behind it, ri&s;ing by degrees higher and higher, till they lead the pro&s;pect in&s;en&s;ibly out of &s;ight. Here he cau&s;ed High Ma&s;s to be celebrated according to the Rites of the Roman Church, with Mu&s;ick, and the &s;ound of Petarrs in&s;tead of Cannon: which made &s;o horrible a noi&s;e, in that hollow place, as &s;eemed far to out-do the loude&s;t Thunder, both for the report, and continuance, having &s;o little Vent to diffu&s;e it &s;elf. The Con&s;ecration of this place he cau&s;ed to be Engraven on the Rock in Latin Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The Air is here &s;o good, that a Noble Venetian, called Antonio Gigli, who retired thither above Thirty years ago, died there not long &s;ince, Aged a Hundred and fifteen years: and there is yet ano|ther of the Family Baroci as aged, as &s;everal per&s;ons worthy of cre|dit, who have lived in the I&s;land, a&s;&s;ured my companion.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;ador brought thence &s;everal ancient In&s;criptions, and placed them in the Wall of his Gardens at Con&s;tantinople: of which more hereafter. About a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot from the I&s;land is a Rock; on which remaineth a mo&s;t beautiful Arch of Marble; which is e&s;teemed to have been the Temple of Bacchus.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t the &s;eventh we had Seriphos, or, as the Greeks now call it &s;hort, Serfo, and our Maps Serphanto, on the right. It hath a Town and an Harbour on the South-&s;ide, with a Covent of Greek Monks, (which we di&s;cerned after we doubled the Cape) dedicated to Saint Michael, the Archangel; to whom they attribute many Miracles done there. Here are Mines of Load-&s;tones; which neverthele&s;s make not the Needle vary, although the Ve&s;&s;els come very near it. Our Pilot told us, he had tried them, but found them not &s;o good, as from other Mines.</P>
<P>In the Evening, the Wind changing We&s;twards, we pa&s;&s;ed between
<PB N="51" REF="39">Thermia and Zea; the fir&s;t of which our Maps call Firmia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THERMIA.</NOTE> and Fir|minia; but the Greeks Thermia, from the abundance of Baths, and Hot-&s;prings, which i&s;&s;ue thence in a great abundance: Thermia in Greek &s;ignifying as much. It is much frequented by the Paralytick, Lame, and many other di&s;ea&s;ed people, being very Diaphoretick. Their Source is near the Port, called Therma. It hath but two Villages, as our Pilot, who is native of the place, informed us.</P>
<P>We plied &s;till Northwards, and pa&s;&s;ed between Macroni&s;a and Suda.</P>
<P>Monday morning, the Ninth, we approached near Tine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TENOS.</NOTE> and dropped Anchor about noon in a Bay on the South-&s;ide thereof; there being no Port on that &s;ide of the I&s;land. Tine was anciently called <GAP DESC="foreign">, as by &s;ome Medals we found there it appeared; which on one &s;ide bear the Head of Jupiter Hammon, and on the other a bunch of Grapes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. 15, 16, 17, 18.</NOTE> de|noting its plenty of Wine, with the&s;e Letters <HI>T H.</HI> Another I &s;aw at Paris among&s;t the King of France's Collections, which had on the one &s;ide the Head of the Emperor Alexander Severus, and on the other a Trident, wreathed about with a Serpent, with the&s;e Letters about it,
&Tgr;&EEgr;&Ngr;&Igr;&OHgr;&Ngr;,
becau&s;e here was a noble Temple dedicated to Neptune; where, as Strabo relateth, the adjacent I&s;lands u&s;ed to perform the Ceremonies of their Religious Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>The whole I&s;land lieth high, being a large heap of Marble Rocks; but in many places covered with a fertile &s;oil. On the South-&s;hore was its ancient City; where nothing now remains, but two or three hou&s;es, called &s;till <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the City. Here are &s;ome ancient Remains, and an In&s;cription, which &s;heweth it, to have belonged to the Monument of Flavius Evergetes, erected by his Wife. Hence we a&s;cended near four miles to a pointed Rock, in the middle of the I&s;land; whereon now is its chief City and Ca&s;tle. As we pa&s;&s;ed, we took notice of its plenty of Vineyards, Figs and Olives. They &s;ay they have Corn, but not to &s;pare; rather wanting the help of other parts, by rea&s;on they are &s;o very popu|lous; this being now the only I&s;land in the Archipelago, that have de|fended them&s;elves from the Turks; and the la&s;t in tho&s;e parts under the Dominion of the Venetians: with whom the Inhabitants have made this agreement, <HI>viz.</HI> That when&s;oever they cannot, or will not protect them any longer, they &s;hall be obliged to deliver the Ca&s;tle to the Inhabitants; who are to have the freedom to chu&s;e whom they will for their Protector.</P>
<P>There are Twenty-four Villages about the I&s;land, which can in time of nece&s;&s;ity retire commodiou&s;ly to this Ca&s;tle; it being in the mid&s;t of them, and having great advantages of nature to defend it &s;elf from any &s;udden a&s;&s;ault: though I believe, &s;carce able to &s;tand out a con&s;ide|rable Siege, for want of Water and Provi&s;ion. The Ca&s;tle is on the highe&s;t point of the Rock, &s;urrounded by the Towns, &s;omething lower than it; and not only over-looketh the whole I&s;land, but almo&s;t all the Archipelago: which afforded our curio&s;ity a mo&s;t delightful pro|&s;pect of the &s;ame. Hence to the Nor-We&s;t we &s;aw Andros, beyond that Euboea, now called Negroponte by the Franks; and more We|&s;terly Zea. Beyond that Macroni&s;a, anciently Helena. At a greater di&s;tance further we could di&s;cern <HI>Capo di Colouxi,</HI> anciently called <HI>Pro|montorium Sunicum,</HI> the mo&s;t Southern Promontory of all Attica. We
<PB N="52" REF="40">&s;aw to the Southward (be&s;ides Thermia, Seriphus, &amp;c.) two I&s;lands they now call Sdilles, or the two Delo&s;es, Rhenea and Delos: to the We&s;t Micone.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of Tine employed them&s;elves in VVorking their own Silk, and that of Andros; but they are no great Arti&s;ts in that Trade. The women knit great part of it into Stockings, and &s;ell them very cheap. Silk is worth about &s;ix or &s;even &s;hillings the pound. There is plenty of fre&s;h water about the I&s;land, although not in the Town; and it did therefore bear the name &s;ometime of Hydri&s;&s;a. The Plants I took notice of more particularly here, were the&s;e: 1. <HI>Limonium,</HI> or, as Gerard calleth it <HI>Limonion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ger. p 412.</NOTE> <HI>folio &s;inuato,</HI> or <HI>Sea-lavender with in|dented leaves;</HI> where I believe either his Printer, or he is mi&s;taken, in the naming it <HI>folio &s;inuato,</HI> for <HI>caule &s;inuato.</HI> 2. Another Thorny &s;hrub, which I know not under what &s;pecies to rank, unle&s;s Jacea. It rifeth from the ground in a thick, round bu&s;h, its branches hard and woody, dividing it &s;elf &s;till into an infinite number of other &s;mall branches, which terminate in Thorns; among&s;t which are many jagged leaves of an A&s;h colour, and with &s;mall &s;caly heads, filled, when blown, with a &s;tringy, white flower, in all re&s;pects like Jacea; but much le&s;s. It was now in &s;eed; but I &s;aw it after in flower at Athens, in the Spring of the year. 3. A kind of &s;mall Stachys, with &s;ilver leaves; and 4. a kind of <HI>Geni&s;ta Spino&s;a,</HI> with red flowers; which I find not any where de&s;cribed, or mentioned.</P>
<P>Our Ships being to &s;tay here &s;ome days, to di&s;charge them&s;elves of the Goods of the new General of this place, who (if I remember rightly) beareth the Title of <HI>General of the Archipelago,</HI> though my com|panion calleth him only <HI>Proveditore;</HI> and al&s;o to take in the baggage of his Predece&s;&s;or, who was to return to Corfu with half of our Fleet, we re&s;olved not to let &s;o good an opportunity &s;lip, without &s;eeing the anciently &s;o renowned I&s;land of Delos, which we had in view, not above eight, or ten miles from Tine. We hired a Bark with four Oars, and had the company of two other Gentlemen, who&s;e curio&s;ity was the &s;ame with ours. The one was Mon&s;ieur Angrand, Nephew to the French Emba&s;&s;ador at Con&s;tantinople. The other Mon&s;ieur Salli, a Flemmi&s;h Gentleman; and for our Guide one Signior Nicolo Cre&s;centio of Tine, D. D. who had &s;tudied at Rome, and under&s;tood the Hi&s;tory of this Country well, and had often been at Delos, when the antiqui|ties thereof were not &s;o much defaced as now they are. This Gentle|man with great civility offered us his company, to &s;hew us the I&s;land. The Wind being fair, and a brisk gale, we &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed over to the I&s;le Rhencia, now called Great Delos; being the neare&s;t, oppo&s;ite to. Port Saint Nicolo, where our Fleet lay: and thence pa&s;&s;ing Ea&s;tward, we cro&s;&s;ed a little Bay, which, they &s;ay, is a good Road, large and deep enough for Ships of the greate&s;t burthen. From the further Cape of it we pa&s;&s;ed a Channel of about half a mile over, (according as Strabo affirmeth it to be) to Delos.</P>

<P>This I&s;land is but &s;mall, not exceeding five or &s;ix miles about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DELOS.</NOTE> twice as long as broad, lieth low, but rocky, and con&s;equently barren. It hath the I&s;land Rhenia We&s;tward; the Southern parts of Micone Ea&s;t, and the Channel between Micone and Tine to the North. It is utterly di&s;inhabited now, and called Little Delos, or Zdeli in the plural number, comprehending the I&s;le Rheneia: which is a corruption of <GAP DESC="foreign">, which, being not ob&s;erved by Strangers, hath been the occa&s;ion of mi&s;takes in many Modern names of places in the&s;e Countries, reported by our late Travellers, Geographers, and Mariners. Now the great rea&s;on, why it was &s;o celebrated among the Ancients was, be|cau&s;e it was the reputed Birth-place of Apollo, as Pindar, Homer, and Callimachus tell us. In devotion to whom the circumjacent I&s;lands, (therefore called the <HI>Cyclades</HI>) to make it the more famous, &s;ent thither by publick order Prie&s;ts, Sacrifices, and Quires of Virgins, in&s;tituting there great and publick Solemnities in the prai&s;e and honour of him. The number of the&s;e Super&s;titious Cyclades, at fir&s;t were but twelve; but afterwards encrea&s;ing, comprehended the greate&s;t part of the I&s;lands of the Aegean-Sea, now called the Archipelago.

<P>It is a Panegyrick in prai&s;e of one Patron, Son of Dorotheus, who had done &s;everal good Offices for the Company of the Tyrian Mer|chants and Mariners, &s;poken by the Chief Prie&s;t in the Temple of Apollo, at a Meeting there, the Eighth of the Month Elaphebolion, the Year when Phaedrias was Archon of Athens, decreed and &s;ub|&s;cribed by the Commons of Athens, and the Company of the Tyrian Merchants and Seamen. But this its Greatne&s;s and Glory being long &s;ince ob&s;cured, it now remains, that I give you an account of its pre|&s;ent mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that we met with, at our arrival to a little Bay, on the We&s;t-&s;ide near the North-end, was a &s;quare Foundation, with eleven Granate Pillars yet &s;tanding about and within it, which they of the I&s;land call the <HI>Schools,</HI> from a Tradition, that there were Schools anciently in that place. Not above a &s;tones ca&s;t from thence,
<PB N="56" REF="42">more Southward, in a large oval Foundation, we found the Pede&s;tal of a Statue dedicated to Mithridates Evergetes, in the time that Seleucus (of Marathon) was Gymna&s;iarch, or chief Governour of the Schools.</P>

<P>Which would have &s;erved to have confirmed the vulgar Tradition of the fir&s;t Ruin, had we not found another to the &s;ame effect, though differing in name, a great way from it; wherefore they &s;erve only to prove, that there was a <HI>Gymna&s;ium</HI> in Delos. But this oval Foun|dation we judged to have been a <HI>Naumachia,</HI> or place to exerci&s;e Naval Recreations in; and the rather, that our Doctor <HI>Cre&s;centio</HI> told us, that he remembred to have &s;een a Hole in the middle of it, which probably might have been to let in the Sea-water, &s;eeing it lieth low enough, and not far di&s;tant from the Sea. It is about three hundred paces in length, and two hundred in breadth; and the Wall about four or five foot from the bottom, but even with the Ground above. Some Pillars yet remain &s;tanding on the brink of it, which made us conclude, that there had been a Portique about it, either for U&s;e, or Ornament, or for both. This &s;eemeth to be that which the Poet Calli|machus calleth <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the <HI>Round Lake;</HI> for his Scholia&s;t, in the Explication of the Place, &s;aying, <HI>that it may be under&s;tood of the Sea, becau&s;e it encompa&s;&s;eth the I&s;land,</HI> addeth, <HI>that perhaps there was a round Lake therein.</HI></P>
<P>Proceeding yet more Ea&s;tward, we came to a va&s;t heap of admi|rable white Marble, which we knew to have been the Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> by the Trunk of his Statue we found among them. This goodly &s;tructure is &s;o entirely ruin'd, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to judge of its form, and the God him&s;elf &s;o ill handled, that he hath neither hands, feet, nor head left him; yet what is remaining appeareth &s;till mo&s;t beautiful; his locks hanging round his &s;houlders are yet to be &s;een, having marks in each curl (as we judged) where Jewels had been &s;et, with a &s;ign about his wa&s;te of a Girdle, which had in like manner been richly adorned, and on his left &s;houlder a light Mantle. The Statue was above four or five times bigger than Nature, and no le&s;s than a Colo&s;&s;us; for the &s;houlders are &s;ix foot broad, and the remain|ing parts of the body proportionable. The beauty of it is &s;uch, that I am apt to believe, if Michael Angelo had &s;een it, he would have admired it as much as he did that Trunk in the Vatican at Rome. It &s;tood upon his Pede&s;tal upright, until about three years ago (as Signior Georgio, our Landlord at Micone, informed me) an Engli&s;h-man who was there, call'd, as he &s;aid, Signior Simon, Captain of the Saint Barbara, endeavoured to carry it away, but finding it impo&s;&s;i|ble, he brake off its head, arms, and feet, and carried them with him. But here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that my Note differs from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI>'s, Tom. 1. p. 180. who &s;aith it was a <HI>Venetian.</HI> A little further, among the&s;e Ruins, we found the half body of a Woman, the

<P>Here are &s;een al&s;o four other pieces; which we gue&s;&s;ed to have been of the Lyons, that the Neighbouring I&s;landers remember to have &s;een formerly here. On the South corner, at the We&s;t end of the&s;e ruins (where perhaps was the entrance of the Temple) is a great piece of Marble hollow in the middle, and almo&s;t buried in the ground; which perhaps was part of the pede&s;tal of the Gigantique Statue of Apollo, becau&s;e on the one &s;ide are the&s;e Letters

which denote, that it had been dedicated by tho&s;e of the I&s;land Naxos to Apollo. The Letters on the other &s;ide we could not well tell what to make of; but-upon con&s;ideration they &s;eem to me to be Vulgar Greek.</P>
<P>From the Temple of Apollo directing our &s;teps Southward, and near the We&s;tern &s;hore of the I&s;land, we came to the Ruins of a wonderful Portico of Marble; who&s;e va&s;t Architraves, Pillars, and other the beauti|ful parts Bury each other in as great confu&s;ion as time and bad Fortune could reduce them to. Upon one of the Architraves broken in two pieces, we &s;ound the&s;e Letters of a &s;pan deep

&Mgr;&Agr;&Kgr;&Egr;&Dgr;,
which &s;heweth, that Philip of Macedon was its Founder. Further upon a little eminence among other Marbles we found the&s;e Letters al&s;o, upon an Architrave:
&Dgr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Ngr;&Ugr;&Sgr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Ugr; &Egr;&Ugr;&Tgr;&Ugr;&KHgr;&Ogr;&Ugr;,
Diony&s;ius the Son of Eutyches, another Grecian King. The Pillars were Angu|lar towards the Ba&s;e, and channel'd upwards, being of &s;everal pieces, and of the Corinthian order, as appeared by their chapetes; of which we found only three or four.</P>
<P>Not far from the South end of this Portique, and on the We&s;t &s;ide of a little rocky Mountain, which undoubtedly was the Mount Cynthus, is a Theater. It is &s;omething more than a Semicircle, who&s;e Diameter comprehending the &s;eats, and utmo&s;t wall is about two hundred Foot; on each &s;ide without its Circumference, are the Foundations of a Tower
<PB N="58" REF="43">Thirty Foot long, and Eighteen broad: Before the Scene are eight, or nine Vaults in a row, an&s;wering Parallel to the Diameter of the Theater; &s;eparated from each other by a wall, in which is a little Arch, &s;erving for a pa&s;&s;age from one to another.

<P>From the Theater Ea&s;twards, pa&s;&s;ing over a world of Ruins, we began to a&s;cend the high Rock, called anciently Mount Cynthus: Which can be called high only in re&s;pect of the other hills in this I&s;land, and not in re&s;pect of the circumjacent I&s;les, which are beyond proportion higher. It is very craggy and &s;teep, and con&s;i&s;ts of a Granate Marble, of &s;everal colours; &s;ome reddi&s;h mixed with black, others lighter; other &s;ome yellowi&s;h, with black &s;pots, and &s;ome a light grey. It is very hard, but I doubt endureth not the weather &s;o well, as that of Egypt. For the Pillars at the Schools I but now mentioned, &s;eem to be of the &s;ame &s;tone, and are very much &s;caled by the weather: This makes me doubt, whether all the Pillars, that are &s;een in &s;o many places, be of the Granate of Egypt. For although Mon&s;ieur Spon took no notice, where any &s;tone hath been dug out of it; yet I believe the way up the Mountain, (which is deep, broad, and winding) was the quarry, where much of that Marble had been taken; for it re&s;embles many quarries I &s;aw afterwards in the Mountain Pentelicus in Attica: Be&s;ides, they would not have be&s;towed the pains to have dug &s;o deep only for a way, nor is it apparent that it
<PB N="59" REF="43">was the way: For on the Right hand, as we a&s;cended up a little di&s;tance from it, is a Port, or Gate, made of &s;uch va&s;t &s;tones, as I believe were dug not far from the place, which was the entrance to go up to the Ca&s;tle on the top of the hill; where yet remain Founda|tions of White Marble. Another quarry of &s;uch &s;tone is on the Alpes, near Lago-Maiore; with Pillars of which the Frontispieces of mo&s;t of the Churches in Millain are Beautified: And I believe tho&s;e of Spalato may come from &s;ome quarrie in the Mountains of Croatia, as I before hinted. This &s;ide of the hill hath a&s;cents one above another, di&s;tingui&s;hed by Walls on each &s;ide of the place, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the way up: Which have been wonderfully Beautified with Porticoes, or Cloy&s;ters, and other Buildings; as the abundance of Pillars, Pede&s;tals, Architraves, and other Fragments of excellent Marble, ranging &s;treight and Parallel to each other, do &s;ufficiently te&s;tifie: There are few Chapitels of Pillars to be &s;een here, or any where in the I&s;land; becau&s;e their Beauty made them e&s;teemed worth carrying away.</P>

<P>Among the&s;e ruins we found an Altar dedicated to Serapis, I&s;is, Anubis, Harpocrates and the Dio&s;couri; who perhaps had a Temple there, though not mention'd by Ancient Authors; or at lea&s;t an Altar in &s;ome other Temple. For here was one dedicated to Latona, the Mother of Apollo; which Strabo calleth <GAP DESC="foreign">, and another of Hercules, as appeareth by the In&s;cription of Patron, under the Archont&s;hip of Phaedrus, which I but now cited. The chief City of this I&s;land reacheth from Mount Cynthus Northwards, to the &s;treight between the I&s;land Rheneia, and the place where we here fir&s;t put a&s;hore, and &s;aw the Gymna&s;ium: For the ruins are continued &s;o far in length, and from the Sea We&s;twards near half the breadth of the I&s;land: From the top of this Mountain I took the pro&s;pect of it; with its other hills and ruins, as I have here de&s;igned it.</P>
<P>In the evening we return'd to our Boat, purpo&s;ing to get to our Ve&s;&s;el that Night; but we found the Sea &s;o rough, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to be done; and therefore the Boat being drawn a&s;hore with Stoechas Citrina, and our Quilts that we brought for fear of &s;uch an accident, we took our Lodging up that Night, in hopes of a calm in the Morning: But the next day the wind was as high as before; yet we re&s;olved to trie to get out, and keeping under the Lee &s;hore, to cro&s;s over to Micone. Neverthele&s;s, &s;o &s;oon as we were got out of the little harbour, the Sea running &s;o high, that it had almo&s;t da&s;h'd our Boat again&s;t a rock, we were forced to put into the next Bay Northward
<PB N="60" REF="44">of the former, and there draw our Boat a&s;hore, and expect in God's good time a fairer opportunity. We had not only bad weather by Sea, but al&s;o a di&s;tre&s;s a&s;hore to &s;truggle with; being in a barren and de&s;ert I&s;land, almo&s;t de&s;titute of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, Victuals, Wine and Water: In this perplexity we went to the top of a &s;teep rock, which makes the Northern Cape of the I&s;land, there to cheri&s;h our hopes with the &s;ight of our Fleet; from which we expected our relief. But to our amazement, and the increa&s;e of our &s;orrows, we perceived them to be under Sail, and our &s;elves like to be left behind: Yet were our troubles &s;omewhat alleviated, when we &s;aw, that our Ships (the current running &s;trong between Tine and Micone, and the wind contrary) could not pa&s;s that way, but were forced to bear over, and come to Anchor at Micone. Our provi&s;ions at this time were reduced to one Penny Loaf, and two or three Mor&s;els of Bi&s;quit, our water was &s;pilt, and not an Engli&s;h pint of Wine left: nor knew we of any Water in the I&s;land; we had &s;earched before, but in vain, for the River Inopus, which Strabo mentions to have been in this I&s;land; but now to be found no where, and perhaps it was only a torrent after &s;ome great Rain; or &s;ome little brook, that the heaps of ruins now keep hid; or el&s;e it ri&s;eth in &s;ome part &s;o near the Sea-&s;hore, that it &s;caped our mo&s;t diligent &s;earch; unle&s;s it be in one place, which I &s;hall hereafter mention. In a word we had no &s;pade nor any other In&s;trument to dig, and find fre&s;h water with: Thus pen&s;ive, and melancholy we &s;eparated, and went &s;everal ways to entertain our &s;elves with &s;olitary Contemplations. I fetched a walk towards a hill, on the North-ea&s;t Corner of the I&s;land; which we had not before &s;earcht: It is near as high as Mount Cynthus; on the top whereof are the Foundations of the Wall of a &s;quare Town, or Ca&s;tle, Fo&s;&s;ed without, but not very deep: From whence below in the Valley, Ea&s;tward, I di&s;covered many Ruins, Foundations, and Pillars, which we had not yet &s;een: As I de&s;cended, going along by the &s;ide of the hill, that I might &s;ee all with more ea&s;e, I found two Ci&s;terns, but without water: The one was newly dried, as by the mud at the bottom appeared; from it goeth a ditch to the Ruins; beyond which, by the Sea-&s;ide, on a ri&s;ing ground is a Foundation, with &s;ome Pillars &s;tanding, and others down; perhaps it hath been a Portico to &s;ome other great Building. This is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, and fruitful part of the I&s;land: Two &s;tones-ca&s;t from this, We&s;tward and South of the I&s;le, are the Foundations of two Temples; in one of which I found a Pede&s;tal of a Statue dedicated to Mithridates Eupator, Son of Mithridates Evergetes, erected by Diony&s;ius Ne&s;anus, an Athenian, who was that time Gymna&s;iarch. The fir&s;t was that famous King of Pontus, who made War with the Romans for &s;o long a time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Mac. VIII.</NOTE> and was at la&s;t defeated by Pompey. Mithridates Evergetes, the Father, was a Friend and Allie of the Romans. This place I believe to have been the New Athens at Delos; of which the In&s;cription in Saint Marks Library at Venice makes often mention, and is Printed in Gruterus, <HI>Page</HI> CCCCV. the Community whereof, I think likewi&s;e &s;ub&s;cribed to the In&s;cription of that &s;tone, which was erected to the honour of Patron. This Town was Built at the charge of the Emperour
<PB N="61" REF="44">Adrian, by the Athenians, and called New Athens; which in all probability was the place Stephanus Byzaut &s;aith, was before called Olympoeum in Delos. One of the Temples there might be that of Hercules, mentioned in the In&s;cription of Patron, and &s;et in that Temple; and the other that of Neptune. In the celebration of tho&s;e Sacrifices Patron's was to be yearly Crowned with a Golden Crown; and whither it is not improbable, but that a chanel might have come from the Ci&s;terns to &s;upply water for the publick &s;ervice, and other u&s;es in his Temple. I know not, whether I may properly call that a Ci&s;tern I now &s;peak off; for perhaps it may &s;ometimes be a &s;pring making the River, Inopus; which had its overflowings like the Nile: for the place &s;heweth no art, but meerly a deep bed; where I perceived water had been: But whether &s;aved there by Rain, or by ri&s;ing out of the Earth, I cannot tell; yet the time of the year &s;eemed to argue again&s;t the former, it being in the heat of Summer, when little Rain falls in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>After I had ranged over this corner of the I&s;land with &s;ome &s;ati&s;|faction (though pen&s;ive enough, when I thought how mi&s;erable we were like to be, if the weather &s;taied us, untill our Ships were gone) I returned to take my &s;hare of that little provi&s;ion we had left; which we divided, with all the Geometry we had, into equal parts; wherewith though we filled not our bellies, yet all &s;eemed &s;atisfied. The Doctor and one of our Watermen were not yet returned; but we &s;aved their parts: But for the next meal we were very &s;ollicitous, not knowing who&s;e turn it might fir&s;t be, to have his haunches cut out, to &s;erve for Veni&s;on to the re&s;t. Some went a hunting with the Flemmi&s;h Gentle|man, which brought his Gun and Dog with him; and found good &s;port with the Hares, and Rabbets, in which this I&s;land yet abounds, being &s;ometimes called Lagia for that rea&s;on. But Mon&s;ieur Engrand and I, being weary of our Mornings walks, &s;tayed by the Boat, and tried &s;ome Philo&s;ophical experiments, how to make fre&s;h water; and fir&s;t how the Sea-water would do by pa&s;&s;ing it through &s;and; with which we filled our Basket, emptied of provi&s;ions: for I rememb'red I had read &s;ome &s;uch experiment; but this proved without effect. After this we fell a digging on the &s;hore, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Sea, with our hands, &s;harp &s;tones, and the ends of our &s;pears 'till we &s;craped &s;o deep, that at length we found water but it was &s;alt. Our Philo&s;ophy failing, after two or three hours, we return'd to the Boat, hot with the toyl, &s;corched with the Sun, and thir&s;ty with ta&s;ting the &s;alt water, and &s;o in de&s;pair of relief laid our &s;elves down in all the &s;hade we could make, under the &s;ide of the Boat: For here groweth now no Palm-trees, or any other that can make one; committing our &s;elves to the mercy of the great Pre&s;erver, as well as Creator of beings. But to lo&s;e no time I began to recollect what Plants I had. &s;een here; Be&s;ides the abundance of Stoechas Citrina I before &s;pake of, here groweth Lentiscus, or the Ma&s;tick &s;hrub, in great plenty, wild; upon which I ob&s;erved Tears of Ma&s;tick, which made us believe, that if it were cultivated here as well as at Scio, it might bear as well as there.</P>
<P>Doctor Cre&s;centio, (who knew that there was water in the I&s;land, and therefore re&s;olved never to give over looking, untill he had found
<PB N="62" REF="45">&s;ome) came within an hour after with this mo&s;t welcome news, that he had &s;ound a Ci&s;tern of water; this made us all though Greeks Romans, Engli&s;h, French, Dutch, and as differing in Religion, as in Country, agree in one to give prai&s;e to our great Pre&s;erver. Not long after returned our hunters, with a Rabbet and &s;ome Birds. So all together we went with the Mariners about a mile from thence, to the top of a little hill, to the North-Ea&s;t of the I&s;land; where the ground ri&s;eth a little higher then the Theater, with Ruins round it; and hath on the top of all a little hollow place, wherein is a &s;mall hole broken into a large Arched Ci&s;tern, only big enough for a man to de&s;cend through by a Rope: For the water is not directly under the hole, but in a further corner not ea&s;ily &s;een, the Ci&s;tern being much filled with rubbi&s;h. It proved excellent water. This I have been larger upon than ordinary, le&s;t &s;ome who&s;e curio&s;ity &s;hould lead them thither, may have the &s;ame need of it, as we had. Having filled all the Ve&s;&s;els we had, we returned cheerfully to our Boat, to prepare our Veni&s;on for &s;upper; which with a Loaf Mon&s;ieur Spon had laid by for a good time, we eat heartily, and with no little &s;atisfaction; not doubting, but he that did this, would, when he &s;aw it con|venient for us, &s;till the winds, and raging of the Sea al&s;o. After this we made a great fire on the hill, of Staechas Citrina, and &s;uch other combu&s;tible &s;tuff, as we found there, to give notice to our Ve&s;&s;el, that we wanted help. This done, we laid our &s;elves down as the Night before; but with no great mind to re&s;t: Before day we found the wind much abated, and in effect a calm. Sowe took the opportunity, and put out to Sea; and although it ran high, yet the wind being low, by great providence we pa&s;&s;ed &s;afe the Chanel, about four miles over, to the Port and Town of Micone.</P>
<P>Micone is &s;o called by the Franks, and was by the Ancient Greeks, and is yet by the Modern, called <GAP DESC="foreign"> Micone. The Poets fancied this to be the Burying place of the Centaurs, conquered by Hercules: It is not &s;o far di&s;tant from Delos, as Ferrarius in his Dictionary a&s;&s;ureth; it being but four miles at the mo&s;t. Between it and Delos is a Scoglio, called by the Franks Dragonera, by the Greeks Tragoni&s;i, that is, the I&s;land of Goats. Micone hath a good and large harbour towards the We&s;t-&s;ide of it; is rather bigger than le&s;&s;er, then Tine, and may have twenty five, or thirty miles in circumference. It is fruitful in Wine and Corn, e&s;pecially Barley, and is well peopled, and by Chri&s;tians only; but now under the protection of the Turks. Their Governour is a Chri&s;tian, &s;ent by the Turks from Con&s;tantinople: Mon&s;ieur Bandrond is therefore mi&s;taken, who hath augmented the Dictionary of Ferrarius, to put it under the Venetians. I had no information, whether it ever were, or when, taken by the Turks: Perhaps it was &s;lighted in the War of Candia, becau&s;e not tenable. For they have but one Town, without any Fortifications by nature, or art; which lieth within the harbour. There is about thirty Greek Churches, and only one Latin in the Town. They pay to the Turk a tribute which he &s;endeth for yearly; but as to the true Sum I know not how to decide the difference between my Companions Memoirs, and my Journal. For he &s;aith it is Three Thou&s;and and
<PB N="63" REF="45">Six Hundred Dollers; but I have noted only that they pre&s;ent the Turk, as often as he &s;endeth his Gallies, Two Hundred Dollers; be&s;ides the mi&s;chief they &s;uffer from them in their Figs and Vineyards. Perhaps the fir&s;t claimed as a duty to the grand Signior; and the la&s;t only as a pre&s;ent to the Carathi; who with great greedine&s;s extort pre&s;ents for them&s;elves, where ever they come. The greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants are Pyrats, and this place is a great Staple for their prey: Here they keep their Wives, Children, and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. The greate&s;t part of the Town &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of Women; who de&s;ervedly have a greater reputation for Beauty then Cha&s;tity; the Men being mo&s;t of them abroad, &s;eeking their Fortunes. Our Captain had here a Seraglio of them, when he was a Cor&s;aire in the&s;e Seas, as I before mentioned. But tho&s;e being now antidated, he was for new game at his coming hither; and therefore found out a pretty young Virgin for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, which he bought of her Brutal Father, as provi&s;ion for his Voyage to Con&s;tantinople. The Hi&s;tory of the taking her I will not let pa&s;s without relating it, becau&s;e I was by accident at the Rape of this fair Helena. The Admiral of our little Fleet, unexpectedly hoi&s;ting Sail, before he had brought her aboard, he &s;ent his long Boat to fetch her away, by &s;ome of his tru&s;ty Servants: I having left &s;omething a&s;hore where I Lodged, begged leave of the Captain to go with the Boat; which I obtained with &s;ome difficulty, not imagining the rea&s;on of their putting a&s;hore at that time. They went &s;treight to the Captains hou&s;e, while I went to fetch my things: When I returned back to them, I found them very merry, drinking with &s;ome other Women the Captain had formerly kept; and al&s;o &s;ome Pirats, who had been of the Captains Comrades, e&s;teemed very &s;tout Men. One, I remember, was extreamly civil to me, and offer'd me many Favours, I knew not how to accept of; and withall a&s;&s;ured me, that if he had the fortune to meet me at Sea; that he would treat me with all civility imaginable; for which I thanked him, hoping never to have any need of his kindne&s;s. Tho&s;e &s;ent by the Captain went &s;treight to the hou&s;e of this young one; who with weeping and great &s;eeming unwillingne&s;s, &s;uffered her &s;elf to be carried to the Boat; whil&s;t her Mother put the re&s;t of the Women in the Town in an uproar; who in multitudes followed her to the water-&s;ide. The Mother &s;tood raging on the &s;hore, as if &s;he had not known what her Husband had done; whil&s;t &s;ome &s;tood to look, and others (I Judge) to be looked on: For along the &s;hore I believe, above a hundred Girls, from ten or eleven, to fourteen or fifteen years old, &s;tood with their Coats as high as their middle (I gue&s;s to &s;ignifie they were ready to accompany her, &s;o &s;oon as occa&s;ion offered:) Thus &s;he was conveyed aboard, and a Cabin built for her, where the Captain could retire to her him&s;elf, and oblige the re&s;t of his Friends. He kept the next day a Fea&s;t, inviting his Officers as to his Nuptials; and had her dre&s;&s;ed very fine in a Venetian habit. For the Women of Miconie's dre&s;s is very odd; although they &s;eem to become them there: I have cau&s;ed what I de&s;igned of it, to be cut as here you may &s;ee.</P>

They wear a Bodies of Red or Green Velvet, laced with Silver or Gold lace in the &s;eams; out of which come their Arms, in a long and large linnen &s;leeve, &s;ometimes laced, or wrought at the hands, wide at the ends, re&s;embling a Surplice.

Wild Foul is there very cheap; a brace of Partridges co&s;t not ordinarily above a Groat, or Six-pence, although they made us pay Ten-pence, becau&s;e we were Strangers. If they had plenty of Powder and Shot, perhaps they would be much cheaper. Water and Wood are &s;carce; one great Ci&s;tern being all, that &s;erveth the whole Town.</P>
<P>Friday, the Thirteenth of Augu&s;t we parted from Micone, and pa&s;&s;ed between it and Tine. On Saturday Morning we &s;aw a far off, on the Right-hand, Nicaria, Anciently called Icaria, famous for the Hi&s;tory of Icarus, and Daedalus: The North-wind ari&s;ing drove us towards Samos; which we &s;aw about Twenty Miles off, Ea&s;t-wards. Towards the evening we were driven almo&s;t into the Chanel, between the &s;hore of A&s;ia, and the I&s;le Scio: So that we were forced to make a great board, to double the Scoglio Venetico, near to which we pa&s;&s;ed. On Sunday Morning we di&s;covered Scyros, and the little I&s;le Caloiro; which &s;ome (mi&s;taken) take to be Giaros, now called Joura, as before. When one di&s;covereth this I&s;land a far off, one would think it to be the Sails of a Ship. At Night the wind coming about South-ea&s;t, we pa&s;&s;ed between the Scoglio Pi&s;ara, and the I&s;le Scio. The wind continuing yet favourable, we left Metelin the Ancient Lesbos on the Right-hand. On Monday a good fre&s;h gale ri&s;ing with the Sun, carried us by Night in &s;ight of Tenedos: Where two of our Ships, the Jove Fulminante and the Fortunetta, being better Sailers, ca&s;t Anchor; whil&s;t we were that Night becalmed. The Seventeenth the North-wind ro&s;e again; in&s;omuch that our Ship was forced to make two great boards to get under the covert of Tenedos, towards the Southern end in the Chanel, between it and the Country of Troy. Here we had &s;o little &s;helter from the wind, that we were forced to ca&s;t out two Anchors to re&s;i&s;t the &s;tream; and the wind by this time was &s;o high, that it endangered the Ma&s;t, and rent one of the Sails before it could be furled.</P>
<P>But before we proceed any further, I will give you an account of &s;ome other I&s;lands in the Archipelago, which we pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;uch other particulars, as we learned from our Sea-men.</P>
<P>But of Samos, Nicharia, and Patmos, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing &s;ince Jo&s;eph Georgirenes, Archbi&s;hop of Samos, hath lately given the World an ample account thereof, Tran&s;lated out of the Vulgar Greek, by a Learned Divine into Engli&s;h; to whom I refer my Reader.</P>
<P>Scio, Anciently Chios, is one of the noble&s;t I&s;lands in the Archipe|lago:<NOTE PLACE="marg">SCIO.</NOTE> It lieth near the A&s;ian &s;hore between Smyrna and Ephe&s;us, is well Inhabited, and Frultful; having one good City, and about a dozen, or fifteen Villages. They cultivate the Ma&s;tick, and Turpentine Trees, and make great advantage of both of them, their Gums being much valued all over Europe. The de&s;cription of both Trees you may &s;ee in Gerard, <HI>Page</HI> 1432. they both grow in the Southern parts of France, but produce no Gum there, this place is renowned at pre&s;ent for good Wine, and hand&s;om Women, and tho&s;e very kind. The de&s;cription you may &s;ee at large in Mr. <HI>Sands,</HI> who was &s;o fortunate as to &s;ee it. They make there al&s;o &s;ome cour&s;e Dama&s;ques; which they &s;end into Barbarie: The I&s;land hath a very good Harbour, and a good Fort;
<PB N="66" REF="47">where the Grand Signior keepeth a Garri&s;on. It hath a bold &s;hore round about it; but as to its Circumference I know not how to give my judgment, having had no information in that particular; and Authors di&s;agreeing: For my Companion &s;etteth it down about Sixty Miles; Peitro della Valle Ninety; and our Country-man, Mr. <HI>Sands,</HI> preci&s;ely Six&s;core and five Miles. It looketh very high, and Mountainous from Sea, and &s;ends down mo&s;t prodigious gu&s;ts of wind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LESBOS.</NOTE> as I experienced returning from Smyrna. Of Lesbos likewi&s;e he hath given a good de&s;cription; for it is much bigger then Scio, and hath plenty of Corn, Wine, and Cattle: Of the milk of which they make much Butter and Chee&s;e, but have little Trade. Each of the&s;e I&s;lands pay Eighteen Thou&s;and pieces of Eight a year Carraeth to the Grand Signior. Tho&s;e that gather it at Scio make the heirs, three years after the death of their Friends, pay it. They &s;ay al&s;o when a Greek changeth his habitation, they make him pay a double Pole-Money; one in the Country he left, and another in that where he cometh to live; unle&s;s they avoid it by &s;ome Artifice, as by concealing their native place, and true Name. Naxia payeth Six Thou&s;and Dollers, Milo Three Thou&s;and, Paros and Au&s;e as much: Scyros Two Thou&s;and, Zea Seventeen Hundred for Carraeth, and for Tenths Two Thou&s;and Five Hundred: Andros Four Thou&s;and Five Hundred, Carraeth, and Six Thou&s;and Eight Hundred for Tenths. Negropont, which is the greate&s;t I&s;land in the Archipelago, payeth a Hundred Thou&s;and Dollers for all its priviledges. The tenths are paid to the Beyes and Vayvodes; who are obliged out of them to keep a certain number of Gallies, without any expence to the Grand Signior. Smyrna maintains two Gallies, Naxia, Meteline, Samos, and Andros, each of them one: Scio two, Micone, and Seripho one; and &s;o the re&s;t in proportion to their Abilities.</P>
<P>But to return to our Ve&s;&s;el at Tenedos. This I&s;land is about four or five Miles from the &s;hore of A&s;ia, about Twenty Miles in Circuit, and Truitful in Corn and Wine, e&s;pecially Muskatels; great part of which is carried to Con&s;tantinople. It hath a Town and a Ca&s;tle, which lieth on the North-end of it; but regarding the Promontory, Sigaeum, towards the Ea&s;t, now called Janizzari, by the Turks, it was taken by the Venetians in the War of Candia, and retaken by the Turks by means of a good round Sum of Money, given to the Treacherous Governour. Near this place was a famous Sea-fight, fought betwixt the Venetians and Turks, with great lo&s;s on both &s;ides, though the Victory remained to the Venetians.</P>
<P>From our Ship at the South-end of Tenedos, we di&s;covered the top of that famous Mountain Ida,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TROY.</NOTE> and in the &s;ame line, upon the A&s;ian &s;hore, va&s;t Ruins of a City; which we took to be the &s;o much celebrated Troy; and therefore we longed very much to &s;ee it, nor had we therein our de&s;ires fru&s;trated. For, Friday the Twentieth of Augu&s;t, the wind holding &s;till contrary or calm, both Wood and Water was wanting to our Ve&s;&s;el; and therefore the long Boat being &s;ent a&s;hore for recruits, we clo&s;ed with that opportunity of &s;eeing the Valiant Trojans Country. We landed in a plain about three Miles North of tho&s;e Ruins, which we &s;aw from our Ship; where digging
<PB N="67" REF="47">in the &s;and (I &s;uppo&s;e the hidden Chanel of &s;ome rivolet) the Sea men found fre&s;h water. This plain is in &s;ome places tilled, and in &s;ome places neglected: It beareth Corn, Cotton, and Se&s;ami (of which they make Oyl). Cucumbers and Melons of &s;everal kinds, as Water-Melons, which the Italians call Anguria, and another kind, which they here call Zucchi. I &s;aw al&s;o in many places neglected, Fig-trees and Almond-trees, with Fruit upon them. Here groweth al&s;o abundance of Oaks, whereof I never &s;aw any of the kind in England. It agreeth &s;omething with the de&s;cription Gerard giveth of the Cerris Majore Glande, or the Holme-Oak with great Acorns; but not well with his Figure. It groweth to a large well proportion'd Tree, with a fair top and large branches; but whether it is good Timber, or no, I know not: Its &s;mall twigs bear a fair leaf, above as long again as broad, broad at the bottom and ending in a &s;harp point, &s;nipped about the edges with deep &s;harp-pointed teeth, like a great &s;aw, and of an A&s;hcolour, &s;omewhat downy. It beareth an Acorn twice as big as our ordinary Oaks; which cometh out of a deep cup, that covereth half the length of it. It is rough on the out&s;ide, with a long, flat, and heavy &s;ub&s;tance; which before the Acorn appeareth, is like to tho&s;e great excre&s;cences, that &s;ometimes are &s;een in the &s;pring upon our young &s;appy Oaks.</P>
<P>In this walk I &s;aw other curious Plants, as 1. Tragacantha,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> out of which Gumme Dragon i&s;&s;ueth in &s;ome places: 2. Pa&s;tinaca Echi|nifera, Fabij Columni: 3. Jacea Lutea, Capite Spino&s;o: 4. Tarton|reina Ma&s;&s;ilien&s;ium, of two kinds, Longifolio &amp; Latifolio: 5. Papaver Caniculatum, horned Poppies, who&s;e Flower is black at the bottom, fomewhat higher, of a deep red, and by degrees end in a Golden Colour: 6. Pancra&s;ium in Flower: 7. Verba&s;cum Marinum, laciniatis Folijs. So that I cannot with Mr. <HI>Sands,</HI> call this barren ground, but neglected: 'With the&s;e curio&s;ities I entertained my &s;elf whil&s;t the re&s;t of our Company diverted them&s;elves with the game they found in great plenty there; as Hares, red Partridges, Quails, Turtles, and a Bird about the bigne&s;s of a Thru&s;h, the head and brea&s;t of a bright yellowi&s;h colour, the back and wings of a greeni&s;h grey, like a green Finch, the beak and head formed like a Thru&s;h, and as fat as Hortu|lans in France and Italie, and our Wheat-ears in England. Another kind, not much bigger, but &s;haped like a Bittern, with a long bill, long legs and claws; a cri&s;t of long Feathers on the Crown, and of a &s;peckled colour like an Hawke.</P>
<P>When we came near to this ruined City, we &s;aw abundance of broken Pillars of Marble and others, parts of Walls and Fundations along the &s;hore, none &s;tanding upright, nor whole, but lying on the ground, and many a good way in the Sea, &s;caled by the weather, and eaten by the Salt-winds, that come from thence. A little further is the mole of a Port yet remaining, with a large and thick wall on the &s;hore; which doubtle&s;s was beautified with tho&s;e many Marble Pillars, that are now broken down all along under it: The mouth is now &s;topped up with &s;and, and remaineth very &s;hallow. I cannot with my Companion, &s;ay, That this was the Port of Troy, &s;o famous in Antiquity; nor yet this City that Ilium, or Troy, who&s;e Wars have
<PB N="68" REF="48">been &s;o Celebrated by the Unimitable Homer and Virgil; nor the An|tiquities there remaining to be of any elder date then the Romans; although Bellonius is confident of it, and Petro della Valle, &s;o won|derfully plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the thoughts of it, that he fancied every great Tree a Hector, or Achilles, or an Aeneas, and all the Briers, and Bu&s;hes, that pricked his &s;hins, their Armies; and could not forbear crying out, <HI>Hic Dolopum manus, hic &s;aevus tendebat Achilles; Cla&s;&s;ibus hic locus, hic acies certare &s;olebant.</HI> But rather that modern Ilium Strabo calleth of his time; which from a Village of the Trojans was begun to be Built by Alexander the great, and was fini&s;hed by Ly&s;imachus, and called Alexandria; afterwards made a Roman Colonie, and enriched with many priviledges. This our worthy Country-man, Mr. <HI>Sands,</HI> hath remarked, and di&s;cour&s;ed of at large, having, I believe, followed Strabo for his guide. But to proceed:</P>
<P>A little above this Port are &s;everal Marble Tombs, &s;ome with the head of Apollo on them, and others with Bucklers; but I &s;aw none here with In&s;criptions. Mon&s;ieur Spon ob&s;erved, that they were of the &s;hape of tho&s;e Roman Tombs at Arles in France; and therefore with all likely hood we judged them to be &s;uch, and not of the Ancient Trojans, as Petro della Valle phan&s;ieth. More South of the Port are two Pillars, lying upon the ground, of thirty Foot in length apiece; and another broken in three pieces, thirty five Foot, as Mon&s;ieur Spon Mea&s;ured them; and the Diameter of this la&s;t, four Foot and nine Inches, of Granate Marble of Egypt. The Grand Signior hath had a great many Pillars carried from hence, to Build the New Mo&s;que of the Sultane Mother. Going yet a little further along the &s;hore we pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome Ruins, that we &s;uppo&s;ed might have been an Aqueduct, to bring water to the Port: Some di&s;tance yet forward brought us to a Chanel, or Valley, which is long, &s;treight, and deep, and undoubtedly made by Art; perhaps to let in the Sea, for Boats to come to the City: But it is now altogether drie. Streight up, beyond this Vallie, a little on the Right hand we came to abundance of con&s;iderable Ruins, which evidently di&s;cover the former greatne&s;s of this place. There is a Theater there, the Foundations and Walls of va&s;t Temples and Palaces, with Arches above, and Vaults under ground.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o part of a little round Temple &s;tanding, which hath a curious Marble Corni&s;h within, and hard by three Marble &s;tones, made in the fa&s;hion of Altars, or Pede&s;tals, with In&s;criptions on them, differing only in the la&s;t Letters, as VIC. VII. and VIC. VIII.</P>

Who the&s;e Scibull were I know not; whether a People, or a kind of Militia. Nor is the la&s;t line of every one of them ea&s;ily under&s;tood. Mon&s;ieur Spon thinketh, that VIC. VII. VIC. VIII.

<P>The whole length is about Four Hundred and thirteen Foot, from North, to South; the breadth from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, Two Hundred Twenty Four. The chief Front looked towards the We&s;t: where at the entrance you leave two Wings of Foundations, one on the Right|hand, and the other on the Left, of equal length, and parallel to each other. That on the Left-hand is divided into two oblongs: Whereof that which is outmo&s;t, Northward, is Twenty four paces
<PB N="70" REF="49">wide, or Seventy four Foot; and hath meerly the Foundations of the out walls remaining, and plain ground within. The next is Thirteen paces wide, or Thirty nine Foot, and is the greate&s;t part of it Vaulted and Arched underground. The other wing on the Left hand is of equal length, and Thirty three paces, or Ninety nine Foot in breadth. This hath nothing, but the Foundations of the Walls remaining, and plain ground within.</P>

<HEAD>Lib: j. Fig <HI>XVI</HI></HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Between the&s;e two there &s;eemeth to have been a large Court; which brings you to three great Arches, in a great and high wall; before which lieth a va&s;t heap of Marble Pillars, Pila&s;ters, Corni&s;hes, and other great Square-pieces in &s;uch confu&s;ed manner, that it is hard to judge in what form they were erected. But a Capital, and &s;ome Pillars &s;hew them to have been of the Corinthian order, Channelled. I doubt not, but the&s;e made a mo&s;t Magnificent Portico before tho&s;e three Arches; which where the Gates, to enter into this Building. For the Wall it &s;elf is but of Free-&s;tone, except the Frize on high, and &s;ome other Ornaments to the Arches which are of Marble; and above the Marble Freeze the wall beginning to bend forward, Arch-wi&s;e, as if it were to Vault a Portico, and the whole wall fini&s;heth at each end about the length of the heap of Marble. The dimen&s;ions of this wall, and Arches are, as I took them by a French Foot (which differeth from ours but three parts of an hundred.) The middle Arch is Forty foot wide, and hath been walled up of the &s;ame &s;tone and work; all to two little doors at each &s;ide. The two little Arches, on each hand of it, are Nineteen foot wide apiece, and filled up with &s;tones, &s;o that there is no entrance by them. The di&s;tance between the Arches is Ten foot; the di&s;tanoe from Arch to each Corner-end is Eleven and an half. The Front is thick Fourteen foot: So that I judge the Portico was a Hundred and Twenty foot
<PB N="71" REF="49">long, and about the breadth, that the great Arch is wide; which is Forty foot. Who&s;e Vault was &s;u&s;tained within by tho&s;e three Arches yet remaining, and without towards the Court by tho&s;e Corinthian Pillars of White Marble, now lying in a heap before the Arches; which without doubt mu&s;t have had a wonderful effect upon the Eyes of the beholders.</P>
<P>Where the wall of the Arches fini&s;h, begin the Foundations of another wall, on each hand, in a &s;treight line of the &s;ame breadth, and reacheth about Forty one foot to the other Foundations I fir&s;t mentioned; &s;o that the whole of the Front within the Court is Two Hundred and three foot. Entring at the middle Gate, or Arch, pre&s;ently you meet another Arch, which is low, and therefore (perhaps) was only an entrance to a Vault beneath. Going yet further you leave two &s;quare Foundations on each hand, and have before you, in the wall oppo&s;ite to the Front, a great Arched Niche, a Hundred foot from the great entrance; and another about the &s;ame bigne&s;s on each &s;ide of it, oppo&s;ite to the two walls, at each &s;ide of the Portico; with half a dozen &s;mall Niches between, on both &s;ides of the great one. From the Northern Niche beginneth the Northern Wall, full of little Arches, as you may &s;ee in that I have endeavour'd to delineate.</P>
<P>The form of this Building would make me believe, that it hath bin a Chri&s;tian Church; did not the Ancient Beauty of the Corinthian work in Marble on the Front forbid me. For in the Ancient Churches of Greece are every where &s;een a Portico, or Pronaos, before the entrance into the body of the Church; where the Catechumeni, or tho&s;e which were not yet fully in&s;tructed in the Faith, or Penitents, who were not admitted into the more holy my&s;teries of Religion, were permitted to enter. Be&s;ides, the three great Niches at the Ea&s;t|&s;ide, are not unlike to the end of a Greek Church: where that on the Right-hand re&s;embles the Prothe&s;is: the middle, the place where the holy Table u&s;ed to &s;tand: and the third, that where the holy Garments u&s;ed to be laid. But it is al&s;o true, that in Heathen Temples many times &s;uch Niches are found, for Statues to be &s;et in. However I believe it not the Ca&s;tle of Priam, as the Country People now call it; nor of any earlier times then the Romans. Methinks, that it &s;ome|thing re&s;embles the form of the Temple of Diana at Ephe&s;us; of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>From this hill is an ea&s;ie de&s;cent every way. To the We&s;t, about two Miles is the Sea: Ea&s;tward is a large plain, &s;tretched out between this hill and Mount Ida; which the River Simois watereth, and where in all probability &s;tood the Ancient Ilum, un&s;een by any of our Company, we not going &s;o far that way; but proved by Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> at large. Northward is a de&s;cent into a &s;mall plain; which then ri&s;eth again to another hill, making the Ancient Promontorium Sigaeum, now Capo Janizzari, entring the Helle&s;pont about &s;ix, or eight Miles di&s;tant from the hill above mentioned.</P>
<P>The day ending &s;ooner than our curio&s;ity, we made ha&s;t to return to our Boat. In the way we &s;tayed to drink at a well, about a Hundred paces from the &s;hore, not above a Bow &s;hot North of the Ancient Port I before &s;poke of. The water of it is very good. But
<PB N="72" REF="50">that they carried to the Ve&s;&s;el from the hidden Chanel, about two Miles more Northward, prov'd not &s;o.</P>
<P>The twenty third of the &s;ame Month, after &s;ome days boarding again&s;t the wind, in &s;ight of the Fort of Tenedos, (which I ob&s;erved to have little &s;trength either of Nature or Art, having only one Tower, furni&s;hed with about Fifteen pieces of Cannon) we came and dropped Anchor, near Capo Janizzari, before a Village called yet by the Greeks Troas. This Cape formerly had a Town called Sigaeum; whence that Cape, entring the mouth of the Helle&s;pont, was deno|minated. Here on the &s;hore are two very good Fountains; from which our Ve&s;&s;el furni&s;hed them&s;elves with water, and from the Town with Provi&s;ions, which are very cheap; e&s;pecially Beans for Sea-men. Of Poultry, we had Fifteen fat Pullets for a Doller, which is le&s;s than a Groat apiece; and Eggs at lea&s;t a dozen for a Peny; and Melons, of many &s;orts are &s;o plentiful, that they &s;ell them for any thing they can get. The Inhabitants are all Greeks, who live by their labour, and the fruit of the ground: Which con&s;i&s;ts in Corn, Wine, Saffron, Figs, Mellons, Almonds, and other Fruits. The Village may contain two or three hundred Families. The French piece of Money of five pence value, called in Turky a Timin, is very current Money every where, and there is worth Fourteen A&s;pers. But the A&s;per is but &s;mall, and will not pa&s;s at Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>Saturday, the twenty &s;eventh of Augu&s;t, we &s;et Sail, and the &s;ame evening dropped Anchor on the South-&s;ide of Imbros, to gain wind. This I&s;land is a little bigger then Tenedos, from which it lieth North. It hath four Villages; of which the Principal is Imbros, guarded by a Fort: It lieth high, and is Mountainous, covered with woods, which are for the mo&s;t part a kind of wild Pear-tree, and are well &s;tored with game; as Hares, Rabbets, and abundance of Wild Boars; of which the Flemi&s;h Gentleman killed with his Dog and Gun, in two hours time a Boar and Sow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IMBROS.</NOTE> with four of their Pigs. But the plea&s;ure co&s;t him dear; for he was left behind on the I&s;land; the chief Commander hoi&s;ting Sail &s;ooner than was expected; yet the Captain being &s;o kind to leave his Skiff, and four Sea-men to wait for him, they found us at Anchor within the Ca&s;tles, after two days time and much danger by weather, and the Current &s;till running very &s;trong out of the mouth of the Helle&s;pont. Mon&s;ieur Spon and I were almo&s;t in as bad a fear: For from the top of the Mountain, which we a&s;cended to view the I&s;land, we &s;oon &s;aw our Ships under Sail; and notwith|&s;tanding all the &s;peed we could make down, had almo&s;t lo&s;t the oppor|tunity of returning to them. Neverthele&s;s we ob&s;erved that the&s;e Mountains had many plea&s;ant Vallies between them, well tilled, and divided into Corn-fields: And many plea&s;ant &s;prings of excellent water, which falling, by many ea&s;ie de&s;cents from the Rocks, make, as they pa&s;s, &s;everal plea&s;ant little ponds to Bath in, under the &s;hade of Fig-trees, Wild-Vines, Agnus Ca&s;tus, and Oleander-trees.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth, Sunday evening, we came with a &s;ide-wind to the mouth of the Helle&s;-pont, and in the Morning entred it, &s;aluting the New Ca&s;tles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HELLES|PONT.</NOTE> placed on each &s;ide of the mouth, who&s;e &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts only in their great Guns, &s;o mounted, that they can do execution
<PB N="73" REF="50">between wind and water. We gave them &s;even Guns, and they an&s;wered with one loaded, as the Turks &s;till do: We returned thanks with five: for at Sea they &s;till u&s;e an odd number in &s;aluting; by which they &s;ignifie that they are Friends. I believe the&s;e new Ca&s;tles were not Built in Mr. <HI>Sands</HI>'s time, becau&s;e he maketh no mention of them. That on A&s;ia &s;ide is &s;een from Troas, whence it lieth not above two Miles, ju&s;t within the Promontory Sigaeum, or Capo Janizzari, upon a flat ground. The other ju&s;t within the oppo&s;ite Promontory of the Thracian Cher&s;one&s;&s;us, on the &s;ide of a hill, with round Towers after the old fa&s;hion, and &s;everal a&s;cents: The mouth lieth We&s;t, a little inclining to the North; and hath a reach, that continueth &s;o about &s;even, or eight Miles within; and then, &s;ome two or three Miles, before ye come at the Dardanelli, or old Ca&s;tles (called &s;o now in oppo&s;ition to the new) it turneth Northward, towards the Propontis.</P>
<P>As we entred in we pa&s;&s;ed very near a bank on the North &s;hore, and dropped Anchor &s;o near another about three or four Miles within, on the South-&s;ide of the Chanel, that we were forced to weigh again, to get more depth and better moorage; otherwi&s;e the Wind and Current would &s;oon have driven us upon it. For it always &s;etteth outward into the Archipelago with a &s;trong Current. This Chanel hath been famous in Hi&s;tory, and hath often changed name. For be&s;ides the name of Helle&s;pont, or Sea of Hellas, Daughter of Athamas King of Thebes, drowned in pa&s;&s;ing it, when &s;he fled from the &s;nares of her Step-mother, Ino, it was al&s;o called the &s;treights of Ce&s;tos and Abydos, two Cities Built on each &s;ide of its banks, oppo&s;ite to each other, and famous for the Amours of Hero and Leander repre&s;en|ted in &s;ome Medels of tho&s;e parts. And in the&s;e latter times it is &s;ome|times called the Dardanelli; which I believe, properly belonged to that they now call Old Ca&s;tles; and by the Italians Labocca di Con|&s;tantinopoli; by us the Chanel, or Streight, of Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>The North-wind &s;till continuing, as it &s;ometimes doth in the Summer time two Months together, we could not get beyond this reach; and being tired with many days waiting for better weather, we re&s;olved to go a&s;hore, to a Village hard by on the A&s;ian Conti|nent, there to take Hor&s;es, or &s;ome other means to carry us to the Old Ca&s;tles; where we might get Boats for our pa&s;&s;age to Con&s;tanti|nople. This Mon&s;ieur Spon took upno him, whil&s;t I &s;taid aboard to &s;ee all things in a readine&s;s to part. But he not returning the next Morn|ing, I went my &s;elf a&s;hore to &s;ee what was the matter: And was carried to a Greeks hou&s;e, where he Lodged with the Bi&s;hop of Micone, and Seriphus; who went a&s;hore with the &s;ame de&s;ign with us. I found them at breakfa&s;t on Grapes, Figs, Honey-combs, Eggs, Chee&s;e, and Water-Mellons; for the Bi&s;hop, being a Caloyer (as they all are) never eateth any Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>This Village is called Kainourio Chorio or New-town, con&s;i&s;ting of about two hundred hou&s;es, all Greeks. It &s;tands very plea&s;antly among Vineyards, and Almond-trees (Wine and Almonds being here extream cheap) and a kind of Juiuba, who&s;e leaves &s;hine like &s;ilver, and are long in &s;hape, &s;pringing out from long, and tender branches like a willow, and yielding fruit, like in &s;hape and colour to other
<PB N="74" REF="51">Jujubs, but of a more mealy-ta&s;t, perhaps, becau&s;e they were over|ripe. The branches grow ordinarily upon a thick-poled trunk, like a willow: I have &s;een another kind of the&s;e, about Smyrna, with a broader leaf, of the like &s;ilver-colour, re&s;embling Portulaca Arbore|&s;eens, where they grow wild in the hedges.</P>
<P>But here we could get neither Hor&s;es, nor Boat. Wherefore Mon&s;ieur-Spon had provided each of us a conceited Chariot, or, to tell the truth, a Cart. The Carriage was wreathed round with wicker, the better to hold the Fruits they bring out of the fields; drawn upon two Wheels, without Spokes, of one &s;olid piece of wood; and in&s;tead of Flanders Mares, by a pair of Boufaleaus, which marched in great &s;tate upon the Grand-pas. But they brought us to the Old Ca&s;tles in as many hours as Miles, which I believe was &s;even or eight. The Con&s;ul for the Engli&s;h, Dutch and Genoe&s;es, called Ezechiel Ru&s;er, met us by the way, and very civily offered to provide us accommoda|tions, either at his own, or his Friends hou&s;e; which we were glad to accept of; and being better mounted then we, did as he had pro|mi&s;ed, and provided us Lodgings at his Friends, Abraham Cor&s;er's hou&s;e, Con&s;ul for the Venetians; both Jews, but very civil per&s;ons.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;tle is now called the Old Ca&s;tle of Natolia, and the other the Old Ca&s;tle of Romelia, as they now call the Continents of Greece and A&s;ia. But were formerly called the Dardanelli: That of Natolia may contain two or three Thou&s;and Souls. We expected, that they &s;hould have been better fortified, being places &s;o con&s;iderable for the guard of Con&s;tantinople. But they are nothing &s;o in effect; having only two or three round Gothick Ba&s;tions apiece: This of Natolia is &s;ituated upon a plain, low ground; the other upon the &s;ide of an hill, within Cannon &s;hot of each other, no ways tenable by land. My Companion and I were of opinion, that the&s;e were not the Ancient Se&s;tos and Abydos, &s;o famous for the Amours of Hero and Leander: Becau&s;e it is neither the narrowe&s;t place of the&s;e Streights, nor yet could we find any Marke of Antiquity for it. But at a place much narrower, which we pa&s;&s;ed, about three or four Miles further North|ward, we found con&s;iderable Ruins on the &s;hore of Natolia. This confirmed us in our opinion, and that the Dardanelli were Built after the Ruine of tho&s;e places. But having &s;ince con&s;ulted Strabo, I am of opinion, that the City, Dardanus, was thereabouts; and that thence came the corrupted, modern, name of Dardanelli, applied to both Ca&s;tles. For in Strabo's order Dardanus followeth Abydos; although his di&s;tance &s;eemeth to differ from our remark; in which, without I had taken a more exact mea&s;ure, I would give way to Strabo; who maketh it &s;eventy Stadia, or about eight Miles.</P>
<P>After this we hired a Boat, about the bigne&s;s of a &s;mall Barge, for ten Dollers, to bring us to Con&s;tantinople, and parted from the Ca&s;tles, accompanied, as the day before, with the Bi&s;hop of Micone, and an &s;talian Gentleman of Millain; being &s;ometimes rowed, and &s;ometimes drawn by our Water-men again&s;t the &s;tream: which &s;till &s;etteth outward, though Petrodella Valle &s;eemeth to make it run both ways. The Current is indeed &s;tronger, when the North-wind blows, then when the South, or when it is a calm; but &s;till it
<PB N="75" REF="51">cometh out of the Black-Sea by the Bo&s;phorus, into the Mare Marmora, and thence into the Archipelago, as they now call the Euxin, Propontis, and Aegean Seas. After awhile we came to that place, which we &s;uppo&s;e to be the true, Ancient Abydos, and there cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treight, about two Miles over, to the European &s;hore; whence the Mariners, rowing all Night, brought us by break of day to Gallipoli.</P>
<P>Gallipoli is a large City, Situated at the mouth of the Propontis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GALLIPOLI.</NOTE> in the Thracian Cher&s;one&s;&s;us, called of old by Strabo, Callipolis, not ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to Lamp&s;acus, (as &s;ome &s;ay) but &s;ome Miles more North|ward. It is almo&s;t an I&s;land, having to the North and South two Bays for Gallies and Boats; and I judge that Ships may ride in the Southern mo&s;t &s;afe; though near the Current. On the &s;hore are &s;ome old dry Stations for Gallies: The Town looketh better from without, then within; as do mo&s;t of the Towns in Turky. For the Mo&s;ques (or Churches) and Baze&s;tans, (or places of Traffick) have their high Cupuloes covered with Lead: which with the Minaretts (or high &s;lender Steeples, from whence they &s;ound out their &s;hrill Voices in&s;tead of Bells, at their times of Prayer) and the goodly tall Cypre&s;s mixt among the hou&s;es, make a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect. But the hou&s;es are incon&s;iderable, and low, Built generally of Wood and Earth: the &s;treets narrow, and &s;ometimes covered with Wood to keep off the Sun. The Town is not walled, no more then mo&s;t of the Cities, or Towns in Turky; except &s;ome Frontier Towns: But they &s;ay it is about &s;ix Miles about. At our arrival we were &s;aluted with the news, that the Plague was in the Town, and much more at Con&s;tantinople; which is no great Noveltie in Turkey, being &s;eldom, or never free. So we thought we had as good begin here to accu&s;tome our &s;elves to its company: But with all care; putting our confidence in the great pre&s;erver of Mankind.</P>
<P>This place did not &s;eem at all populous, con&s;idering the bigne&s;s; whether becau&s;e of the Plague, or not, I am not certain; neverthe|le&s;s they reckon the number of the Inhabitants, to be Twelve Thou|&s;and Turks, Four or Five Thou&s;and Greeks, and as many Jews. The Beze&s;tan is the only thing worth &s;eeing here; being Built Square, with &s;ix Cupoloes covered with Lead. We lodged in an open place, by the Southern harbour; being unwilling to venture our &s;elves, where we knew no body, e&s;pecially when the place was &s;o infected. But had the Italian Con&s;ul (who was a Frier of the order of Saint Francis) been in Town, at his little Convent, of him we might have hoped for directions to better accommodation. This place hath the reputation of the be&s;t Water-Melons in tho&s;e parts; and we had as many as we would for nothing; there lying great heaps of them neglected, in the place where we Lodged. There remain &s;mall marks of its Antiquity, and not much of its fame in Ancient Authors. On &s;hore, by the Southern Port, lieth a Frize of Marble, very well wrought; and we found in the Town a &s;mall In&s;cription, where the name of one Theodotus and Bitana, Daughter of Anticles is mentioned.</P>

<P>We hoped to find &s;omewhat more con&s;iderable at Lamp&s;aco;<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAMSPACO.</NOTE> which is on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treight, on the A&s;ian &s;hore, &s;omething more to the Southward: And therefore, the wind being contrary for our proceeding forward, we took a bigger Boat and cro&s;&s;ed over, notwith&s;tanding a &s;trong wind, that from the Propontis brought &s;uch foaming billows, as often was like to oreturn our little Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Lamp&s;acus, now called Lamp&s;aco, hath lo&s;t the advantage it had in Strabo's time of Callipoli; being now but a &s;mall Town inhabited by Turks, and &s;ome Greeks. Strabo counted the &s;treight about five Miles over; and I believe it is not much more or le&s;s. Lampa&s;cus was one of the Towns Xerxes gave to Themi&s;tocles: Magna&s;ia was for his Bread, Myuns for his Meat, and this for his Wine. And it hath yet indeed abundance of fine Vineyards all about it, e&s;pecially on the South parts, well hedged with Pomegranate Trees. In this place the God Priapus, was wor&s;hipped before any of the re&s;t, as Pau&s;anias affirmeth: And was more Anciently called Petyu&s;a. It had a good harbour, and was counted Twenty one Miles [or 170 <HI>Stadia</HI>] from Abydos: It now con&s;i&s;ts of about Two Hundred hou&s;es, and hath a fine Mo&s;que; who&s;e Portick is &s;upported by Red Marble Pillars. It was formerly (they &s;ay) a Chri&s;tian Church as they well prove by the Cro&s;&s;es that yet remain, carved on the Capitals of the Pillars. Entring into the Coffee-hou&s;e, we met with one that could &s;peak a little Italian, and was &s;o kind, as for our Money to &s;hew us the Town; and indeed &s;hewed us many In&s;criptions. The be&s;t were in the Garden of a Turk, called Achmet, Aga, Tchelebi.</P>

<P>Another he &s;hewed us, where he &s;aid were formerly many Pillars, and other Marbles dug up; and &s;ome other Ruins, which we judged to have been the Ancient Walls of the Town. Another we Copied at a Chri&s;tians hou&s;e; who told us, there had been &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els of Marble, with In&s;criptions on them, found thereabouts in the ground, and are now in the hands of a Turk, though formerly belonging to a Prie&s;t, which we could not &s;ee, he not being then at home. He al&s;o conducted us about a Mile out of Town, through the Vineyards, to the Foundation of an Ancient Temple; where he told us was an In&s;cription, but we found it not. There lie about it a dozen of Marble Pillars, at the Front, heaped upon one another: of which they confidently tell, that part of the&s;e were carried by the Turks to the Town, to Build a Mo&s;que with; but that they were brought back again in the Night by no body knows what means, and that twice after one another.</P>
<P>The Turks here are not &s;o &s;crupulous, as in many other places; where they dare not plant Vineyards; Wine being forbidden them by their Law. Here they take the liberty of making them boiled Wines for Sorbet; and make Aqua Vitae, under the pretence of having Grapes to eat: Of which mo&s;t of them drink more freely than we do.</P>
<P>We returned in the evening to Gallipoli, with the &s;ame wind as in the Morning, and little le&s;s danger. The next evening we parted from Gallipoli in the calm, and in the Morning found our &s;elves at Pera&s;te, Thirty Miles forwarder on the Thracian coa&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERASTE.</NOTE> It is a Town of about two hundred hou&s;es. Here the Aga, or Governour, &s;ent very civilly for us his Son; (having &s;een the Abbot Charpentier before at the Old Ca&s;tles: Who went the &s;ame way with us;) and entertained us with Coffee, and other Fruits. Here the number of the Turks and Chri&s;tians are about equal. At a Church we &s;aw the head of a Bacchus defaced, with &s;ome other Fragments of Antiquity, here and there upon the ground: But I cannot well gue&s;s at the Ancient name of the place; we bought Wine here, for our Voyage, at four A&s;pers the Oka, (a weight u&s;ed in Turkey of about Forty two Ounces, as I remember) which is not above Three-half-pence the quart.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="53">
<P>Half a dozen Miles further we &s;topped again, at a Village called Heracli&s;&s;a,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERACLIS|SA.</NOTE> a good large Town on a hill.</P>
<P>About &s;ix or &s;even Miles further, at an other Town, called by the Greeks Myriophyton, and by the Turks Murfton, of about two hundred hou&s;es, here walking in the &s;treets, we were da&s;hed out of Countenance by the Children; who flocked after Mon&s;ieur Spon, making a noi&s;e we under&s;tood not: which I believe was, by rea&s;on Mon&s;ieur Spon had put on a pair of Turki&s;h Slippers to his French Sute; which I confe&s;s made but a ridiculous &s;how. We there|fore returned to our Boats; and there were met by the Sangiac, that governed the place; who &s;eeing us to be Strangers, acco&s;ted us very civilly with the little Lingua Franca that he had. He told us, that he had been taken a Slave about three years before, and carried to Malta, by one Captain Daniel of Mar&s;eilles, a Pyrate; of who&s;e civility to him he gave great Commendations; and that it was but a little while &s;ince he got his liberty, which co&s;t him &s;ix hundred Dollers. He was very civil, asked us whether we wanted any Provi&s;ions, and after we had taken our leave of him, &s;ent us a Basket of admirable white Grapes, in bunches of a great length, and the Fruit as big as Pigeons Eggs.</P>
<P>Hence, four or five Miles further we came to a large Town, called Chora,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHORA.</NOTE> &s;ituated very plea&s;antly on a little hill, who&s;e a&s;cent is &s;teep on every &s;ide; which &s;eparates it, as by a large Trench, from the High-hills that encompa&s;s it on all parts, except towards the Sea. From thence parting in the evening, we made about twenty Miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RODESTE.</NOTE> and found our &s;elves in the morning over again&s;t Rode&s;te. A Town at lea&s;t as big as Gallipoli, and more populous. It is &s;ituated upon the brow of an hill, at the bottom of a Bay, and maketh a goodly &s;hew towards the Sea. We could number ten or twelve Mo&s;ques by the Minaretts. The Greeks have al&s;o they &s;ay many Churches there.</P>
<P>From Rode&s;te the &s;hore of the Propontis (or mare Marmora) rangeth it &s;elf Ea&s;twards. At the oppo&s;ite Promontorie of this Bay we made a &s;top; becau&s;e we &s;aw the weather begin to gather: which made us look for a wind, but from what quarter we knew not; for it was till now calm. This gave me opportunity to &s;earch, what Plants this &s;hore produced. Be&s;ides &s;everal that I had mentioned before in other places, I found a &s;ort of Shrub Spurge, which by the Herbali&s;ts is named E&s;ula Rara, Atractylis Purpurea; and one or two more, I have not yet names for.</P>
<P>We had not &s;taid here long, but the wind we expected proved a bri&s;que South-wind; which three or four hours before Night brought us thirty Miles over a Gulph to Heraclea. This Town hath a good harbour; who&s;e mouth lieth Ea&s;t of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERACLEA.</NOTE> turning about &s;o, that it maketh a Penin&s;ula. It bends round in the form of an Amphitheater, and may have about four or five Miles in Circumference. The Town lieth in the Streight, having the Sea on the one &s;ide, and the Port on the other; we made ha&s;t a&s;hore, to employ what time we had in viewing it; &s;oon di&s;covering it to be a place of great Antiquity by the Foundations of the old walls, e&s;pecially on the We&s;t-&s;ide, and towards the Haven; where &s;trewed up and down, we &s;aw abundance of Fragments of Marble
<PB N="79" REF="53">Statues, Corni&s;hes, Bulls-heads, Wreaths of Plenty, and broken Pillars; and of &s;uch are compiled the pre&s;ent Buildings of the Town.

But by better fortune we ca&s;t our Eyes upon a Goo&s;e wing, lying in the &s;treets, which furni&s;hed us again with Pens; and therewith we Copyed &s;everal good In&s;crip|tions, e&s;pecially one, where we found the name Perinthus, which this City bare in the time of the fir&s;t Roman Emperours; it being more Anciently called Heraclea; which it regain'd in the time of the latter Emperours, as Zozimus reporteth, and yet retains the &s;ame.</P>

Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> the Kings Emba&s;&s;adour at Con|&s;tantinople as we were one day Di&s;cour&s;ing concerning the Situation of this place, gave us an account of an In&s;cription, that he found at a Town called Chourly, in the way to Adrianople, erected in honour of the Emperour Herennius Etru&s;cus, by the Perinthians; which being too big to be removed, he was of opinion, that that might be the Ancient Perinthus. But we concluded, that it was rather a Town under the jurisdiction of the Perinthians, as Byzantium was, a great deal further off. For this is not many Miles di&s;tant from Heraclea but could not be the Perinthus, becau&s;e the Ancient Geographers make it a Port as Town Traclea is, but Chourly an In-land Town. And there|fore the rever&s;e of their Coyn was u&s;ually a Gally, of which I have a curious Medalion, that my Friend Mon&s;ieur Spon helped me to at my return. It hath the Head of the Emperour Septimius Severus on one &s;ide, and a Gally on the other, with the Sails hoi&s;ted, and the&s;e Letters about it

<P>We found here another In&s;cription of the Emperour, Hadrian, in the Cathedral Church; be&s;ides one more in the Town, being only a Sepulchral &s;tone of a Roman.

<P><HI>COn&s;tantinople</HI> being the Chief Seat of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> now, as it was &s;ometime of the <HI>Roman,</HI> and after the Divi&s;ion, of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire, hath therefore been &s;till the mo&s;t frequented of all the&s;e Parts, both by Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Curio&s;ity, and de&s;ervedly the City of all others; of which, Travellers have endeavoured to give the mo&s;t accurate Accounts: In doing where|of, many of them have &s;o well acquitted them&s;elves, that I believe, we have not more exact Surves of any of our Neighbouring Places in <HI>Europe,</HI> than they have already obliged the World with. With|out &s;peaking of <HI>Bellonius, Gillius, Petro Dellavalle,</HI> Mon&s;ieur. <HI>Tavernier,</HI> we have enough of our own Country, who&s;e Pains to this Place, and the whole <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, merit Thanks of all Impartial and Ingenious Men; as Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> many Years &s;ince, Mr. <HI>Rycaut,</HI> who when Con&s;ul to His Maje&s;ty at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> publi&s;hed an exact Account of their Poli|cy; and &s;ince his Return, other Treati&s;es concerning this Empire: La&s;tly, Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> B D. and Fellow of <HI>Magdalen Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford;</HI> whom, e&s;pecially as to the Topographical Account of this City, I look upon to be the mo&s;t Exact of any other. Therefore, knew I how to give my particular Remarks entirely &s;eparate from what hath been already written, with any &s;atisfactory Coherence, I would &s;pare both my Self, and Reader, the Trouble of any further Account of it, than to let them know by the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, That I al&s;o have been to &s;ee this &s;o celebrated Place. But &s;ince that cannot ea&s;ily be done, and that the Reader, who is de&s;irous to have &s;ome Information about this City, as he goes along, may not be di&s;appointed altogether of his Expecta|tion; I &s;hall give &s;ome Account of tho&s;e Things which are there prin|cipally remarkable, tho' it be much the &s;ame with what is already given by others; which I &s;hall di&s;patch with all the Brevity that can con&s;i&s;t with a due Ob&s;ervance to, and Illu&s;tration of &s;uch other Remarks of my own, as have not been taken Notice of, &s;o far as I know, by any that have gone before me.</P>

<P>Our Modern Geographers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LATITUDE.</NOTE> in their Maps, place this City in Forty-three Degrees of Latitude: But Dr. <HI>Covel,</HI> Chaplain to Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, when I was there, a&s;&s;ured us, That by many Ob&s;ervations made with the A&s;trolabe at the Aequinoctials, he found it to have only Forty Degrees, and Fifty &s;ix Minutes; which agreed al&s;o with the Ob&s;ervations of a late <HI>Je&s;uite,</HI> a good Mathematician, who lived there, and al&s;o, that <HI>Adrianople</HI> hath Forty Degrees, and Eighteen Minutes.</P>

<P>It is of a Triangular Figure, two of who&s;e &s;ides, to wit, towards the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">FIURE.</NOTE> and the Harbour, are as two Segments of a Circle, ben|ding much inwards to each other: The Fir&s;t beginning from the Pro|montory, called now St. <HI>Demetrio,</HI> whereon <HI>Byzantium</HI> was antiently built but now the Grand Signior's Seraglio; and running thence South-Ea&s;t-wards, to the Seven Towers, is counted about Five or Six Miles.

<P>The Walls on Two fides towards the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">WALLS.</NOTE> and the Harbours, are built &s;o &s;mall a Di&s;tance from the Water, that in many Places there is not room to pa&s;s between the Square Towers that jet out of it, at equal Di&s;tances, and the Sea.

<P>They are built of rough Stone, and here and there patched up with Brick, being &s;ingle towards the Sea, but &s;ome part towards the Land double.</P>
<P>There are about Five and Twenty Gates, Seven towards the Pro|pontis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GATES.</NOTE> Seven towards the Land, and Eleven towards the Haven.</P>
<P>Every way from the Sea-&s;ide the Land ri&s;eth higher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROSPECT WITHOUT.</NOTE> untill it is &s;wel|led into an indifferent high Hill, which runneth in a Ridge We&s;t|wards; and hath Seven Points higher, and more Per&s;picuous, than the re&s;t, Crowned with very high and beautiful Mo&s;ques, which give a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect to the Beholders at a Di&s;tance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">WHAT WITHIN.</NOTE> So that Strangers are commonly &s;welled with extraordinary high Conceits of it; but perhaps, no Place in the World deceives their Expectation more than this; for the Streets are narrow, dark, and &s;teep, compo|&s;ed of &s;mall, low, and ill built Hou&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting of Wood, Earth, or at the be&s;t, but rough or unhewen Stone. The Private Hou&s;es are but mean and beggarly; it is only the Grand Signior's Palace, the
<PB N="180" REF="56">Mo&s;ques, Bagnos, Bazzars, and Kans, that make &s;o &s;plendid a &s;hew at a Di&s;tance; of &s;ome of which, I will now &s;peak more particularly.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as we could Equippe our &s;elves after the Turki&s;h Mode, we were in pain to &s;ee the Grand Signior's Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERAGLIO.</NOTE> whereof we had &s;o &s;plendid a Pro&s;pect from <HI>Gallata,</HI> and of which we had heard &s;o great Things by Fame. For from thence its Roofs rai&s;ed high more by the Advantage of the Ground, than its Numbers of Stories, con|&s;i&s;ting of a great Number of Cuppaloes, covered with Lead, encom|pa&s;&s;ed with large Gardens, &s;haded with Cypre&s;s-Trees, wonderfully rai&s;ed our Expectation, at that Di&s;tance. The <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Padi&s;ha-Sera&iuml;,</HI> &s;ignifying the Kings or Emperours Palace, <HI>Sera&iuml;</HI> &s;ignifying any great Building; and from this word, our We&s;tern Chri&s;tians form <HI>Se|raglio,</HI> which they apropriate to this Palace. As the whole City, &s;o is That in proportion a kind of a Triangle, wa&s;hed on two &s;ides by the Sea, and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rated from the re&s;t of the City by a high Wall, South-We&s;t and South, which may be about Three Miles in Compa&s;s. We were conducted by a Street along the We&s;tern-Wall, till we came to the Southern-Gate; which hath nothing about it &s;o &s;tately, that all Amba&s;&s;adours &s;hould be denominated from thence Amba&s;&s;adour at our Lofty Port, as it is &s;till expre&s;&s;ed in all Capitulations with the Grand Signior. It is propped up on the Out-&s;ide with Two cour&s;e Marble Pillars, &s;et up with little Art or Ornament, only &s;ome old Armour is hung up on the In-&s;ide. It leadeth into a long, but narrow Court, lying in no Decent Order: At the Right-hand whereof, are &s;ome Buildings, &s;erving for &s;uch as are Sick, in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> to lodge till they are cured. On the Left-hand is a Building, where the meane&s;t Servants are lodged. Beyond that is another Round Building, &s;uppo|&s;ed by &s;ome to have been part of Hagia-Sophia; but I doubt, the Di|&s;tance is too great, to have &s;erved as a Sacri&s;ty to it, as &s;ome think. There is now &s;ome Arms laid up in it, as we ob&s;erved, looking into it from a great Wood-&s;tack piled up between it and the Hagiam-Go|lams, or Servants Lodgings. Beyond this is another great Gate, which brings into another large Quadrangle, divided into many Irregular Par|terrs, planted with &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, according as the Wayes to the &s;everal Offices direct, having a large Fountain placed in the Middle. This Court is encompa&s;&s;ed on this &s;ide of the Gate, and the Right-hand, with a fair Portico, &s;u&s;tained by the tall Granate Marble Pillars; who&s;e Capitals, and Ba&s;es, are bound with Bra&s;s, paved with Marble, and co|vered with Lead, in many &s;mall Cuppaloes. At the Left-hand, &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Gate, is their Court of Judicature they call the <HI>Divan;</HI> where all Civil and Criminal Cau&s;es are tryed by the Vizier, or his Deputy, the Chaimacham, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by other Lawyers. We were not permitted to go in, but &s;aw them only at a Di&s;tance; for none are allowed Entrance, but &s;uch as have Bu&s;ine&s;s. It joyns to other Build|ings, continued up to the Side, oppo&s;ite to the Gate: whence the Grand Signior can come, when he plea&s;eth, to a private Window, looking into the Divan, to hear the Determinations of Cau&s;es, un&s;een to any pre&s;ent; and, if he ob&s;erves any Inju&s;tice done by his Officers, calls them to an Account for it; which hath many times co&s;t them their Places, and &s;ometimes their Lives, in other Emperours Reigns: but This hath
<PB N="181" REF="56">&s;eldom Re&s;ided here long; otherwi&s;e from the Sentence of the Vizier, or Chaimacham, there is no Appeal, or other Remedy. The Buildings on the other &s;ide, oppo&s;ite to the Gate, are low built; they &s;eemed, at that di&s;tance, only to con&s;i&s;t of Wood and Mortar, expre&s;&s;ing little of Beauty or Art; the only Ornament is the Roof, built of many &s;mall Cuppaloes near together, covered with Lead. On the Right Hand of this Quadrangle, is a Gate that leadeth to a whole Street of Kitchins and Stables, who&s;e Roofs are all covered with Lead, and beautifyed with Cuppaloes. The Kitchins &s;eem too &s;tately for the Turki&s;h Cooke|ry; who&s;e chief Di&s;h is only Rice, half boyled with a Hen, which they call Pillau. I &s;aw not many fine Hor&s;es in the Streets, becau&s;e the Grand Signior was at <HI>Adrianople.</HI> The inmo&s;t Court of the Se|raglio, beyond the Third Gate, and the Womens Appartment, is kept Secret, and to Chri&s;tians inacce&s;&s;ible, except upon extraordinary Oc|ca&s;ions. Beyond them, to the point of the Promontory, are the Gar|dens, which towards the We&s;t al&s;o, reach up to the great Gate. They &s;peak of Fountains, and great Curio&s;ities in them; but un&s;een to us. We were carried upon the Top of the Wood-pile, at the We&s;t End of that round Building, &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to Hagia-Sophia; whence we could look over the Wall, into the Gardens: The greate&s;t Ornaments we could di&s;cover, were the tall Cypre&s;s-Trees; but &s;et in no good Order: And as to Knots, Flowers, and other Delights of that Nature, I could di&s;cover none. They &s;peak of an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Obelisk here; which we &s;hould have been glad to have &s;een, but more of the Li|brary, reported to be in the Seraglio; and in that more particularly of <HI>T. Livius,</HI> that is &s;aid to be there entire: But we were told, That it could never be found, although va&s;t Sums of Money have been offe|red to the Bu&s;tangi Ba&s;ha for it.</P>
<P>When we had &s;een as much as we were permitted, of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> we returned out by the &s;ame way we came; for although there be &s;ome other Gates, yet they are not for any ordinarily to pa&s;s out and in at, but kept &s;till fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Curio&s;ity led us, in the next place, to &s;ee the great Mo&s;ques;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOSQUES.</NOTE> which are indeed very Magnificent, and Splendid. The fir&s;t, near the Seraglio, is Hagia-Sophia, or Sancta-Sophia; the <HI>Turks</HI> having continu|ed the Name, although they have robbed <HI>God</HI> of the Honour once paid Him by the Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip in that Place: For it was once a mo&s;t Magnificent Church, built by the Emperour <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> and dedicated to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Wi&s;dom of <HI>God,</HI> by the Title of <GAP DESC="foreign">. On the We&s;tern End is a large Portico, the Breadth of the whole Fabrick, which you enter into by the Three great Doors; and is ceil'd with Mo&s;aick Work, containing &s;everal Hi&s;torical Figures out of the Holy Scripture, but &s;omewhat defaced by the <HI>Turks.</HI> This leads into the Church, by Five large Bra&s;s Folding-Doors, which is a mo&s;t Magnifi|cent Fabrick, ceil'd again with Mo&s;aick Work, paved with &s;everal &s;orts of Marble, Porphyry, Serpentine, Ja&s;per, and Figures of Incha&s;ed Work. It is a very great Length, and is crowned towards the Ea&s;t End, with a va&s;t Cuppalo, &s;u&s;tained by four ma&s;&s;y Pillars, encru&s;ted as are all the Walls, with a whiti&s;h Marble. The great Cuppalo is encompa&s;&s;ed by &s;mall ones &s;omewhat lower. St. <HI>Peters</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> may excel this Cup|palo
<PB N="182" REF="57">in height, but not in Breadth nor Beauty. Four very tall and &s;lender Steeples, they call Minorets, are placed by the <HI>Turks</HI> about it; one at each end of the Portico, and the re&s;t on each &s;ide the Cup|palo, ranging &s;quare to each other. But for the&s;e Spires they have added, they have taken very much more from it; if it reached former|ly, as is thought, to the Seraglio. It is vaulted underneath, which now &s;erveth for a Ci&s;tern to receive the Waters from the Aqueducts, whence it is conveyed about the City by Pipes. This is neither kept &s;o well in repair, nor adorned as the other Mo&s;ques built by the Sul|tans: Therefore I will defer to de&s;cribe its Furniture as a Mo&s;que, till I come to another more Magnificently adorned.</P>
<P>About Hagia-Sophia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEPUE|CHERS.</NOTE> &s;ome di&s;tance from the Outward Gate of the Seraglio, are many of the Sepulchers of the Grand Signiors. They are little &s;quare Buildings, of white Marble, and covered with Cuppa|loes. Within are placed their Tombs, encompa&s;&s;ed with a low Rail, or Grate. The Emperour lies in the middle, in a large Che&s;t of Mar|ble, made bigger towards the Head than Feet, covered with a Pall of Silk, and &s;ometimes Embroidered; Wax-Candles &s;tand one at the Head, and another at the Feet, of the bigne&s;s of a Mans Leg, and about a Yard long: Their Wives and Children lie about them in Che&s;ts of the &s;ame Shape, but le&s;s according to their Age and Bigne&s;s. The Males are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Females by a Turbant, &s;et up at the Head of each Tomb; the Females have only a Pall on theirs. Tho&s;e Chil|dren that have been Strangled by the &s;ucceeding Emperour, are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t, by a Handkerchief tied about the Staff, holding up the Turbant. The&s;e Sepulchers are frequented by poor Men, who have an Alms allowed them for &s;aying Prayers for the Souls of the Decea&s;ed, which they number by long &s;trings of Wooden Beads, as big as Musket-Bullets; being placed there, and wound up on great Rolls for that purpo&s;e: For not only the <HI>Latines,</HI> but the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;e Beads in their Prayers; but the Two la&s;t tell them over the fa&s;t|e&s;t: For the <HI>Latines</HI> con&s;i&s;t of a Circle of different Prayers; but the <HI>Greeks</HI> u&s;e only <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon me;</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> either a word in their own Language to the &s;ame Effect, or another &s;ignifying <HI>God be prai&s;ed.</HI> We went into Three or Four of the&s;e; but the mo&s;t melancholy Sight, was that of Sultan <HI>Hackmet,</HI> who (they told us) had an Hundred and Twenty Children all de&s;troyed by the &s;ucceeding Emperour, in one day, and lie there Buried about him.</P>
<P>From the Southern-Gate of the Seraglio, and Sancta-Sophia, goeth the faire&s;t and large&s;t Street of the whole City, quite through it We&s;t|wards, pa&s;&s;ing by the Northern-End of the Hippodrome, and &s;o to <HI>Adrianople</HI>-Gate. This Street is adorned with &s;everal of the Monuments of the Viziers and Ba&s;ha's, who have highly merited of the Emperour either in the Wars or Government. Among which, we ob&s;erved one with the Cuppalo, covered only with a Grate of Wyer; of which we had this Account:<NOTE PLACE="marg">CUPRIOULI.</NOTE> That it was of <HI>Mahomet Cupriuli,</HI> Father to the pre|&s;ent Vizier, who &s;ettled the Government, during the Minority of the pre&s;ent Emperour, very near De&s;truction, through the Di&s;contents and Factions of the Principal Hagaes, and the Mutinies of the Janizaries. Con|cerning whom, after his Decea&s;e, being buried here, and having this

<P>From Hagia-Sophia, we were Conducted by this great Street,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE HIPPO|DROME</NOTE> to the place Achmet-dam; which was antiently an Hippodrome, or a place for Hor&s;e-racing. It is about Five hundred and fifty ordinary Paces long, and about an Hundred and twenty broad, and was adorned an|tiently with &s;everal excellent Ornaments; of which only Three Pillars remain for me to give you an Account of.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a Pillar of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Granite Marble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIEROGLY|PHICAL PIL|LAR.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of one Stone about Fifty Foot long, and erected on a Pede&s;tall of Eight or Ten Foot above ground; but how much under, I know not. The Pillar is four &s;quare, ending on the Top in a Cone, and is engraven on the four &s;ides with many Todd Figures; and therefore hath de&s;ervedly obtained the name of the Hieroglyphical Pillar: For tho&s;e Figures are really the Hieroglyphicks of the Antient <HI>Egyptians;</HI> to the Interpretati|on of which, our Modern Learning will not reach.

<P>On the North of the Pede&s;tal, is a Ba&s;&s;o relievo, expre&s;&s;ing the man|ner how this Pillar was &s;et up; and another below that, repre&s;enting the Hippodrome, as it was before the &s;etting up, with the manner of their Hor&s;e-racing. It appears with four principal Pillars, with a vacant place in the middle where this is now &s;et up, which made the Feet all equally di&s;tant one from each other. The ordinary Stadiums of the Antients had but Three Pillars, being but One hundred and twenty five paces long; which is a great deal &s;horter than this From the Fir&s;t Pillar they &s;tarted their Hor&s;es, having the word
&Agr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Sgr;&Tgr;&Egr;&Ugr;&Egr;,
or Courage, written on the Pillar, given them. At the Middle they were called upon to make ha&s;te, by the word
&Sgr;&Pgr;&Egr;&Ugr;&Dgr;&Egr;,
which was written al&s;o on the Pillar. At La&s;t they were to return riding about the Pillar on the further end; therefore, it had the word
&Kgr;&Agr;&Mgr;&PSgr;&Ogr;&Ngr;
engraven on it. By this Ba&s;&s;o-relievo, is expre&s;&s;ed the Running of the Hor|&s;es, and the Emperour &s;tanding in the middle, crowning the Victor: But what that held up by Four Pillars, and the other &s;ingle round Pillar were for, we could not conjecture; unle&s;s only for Ornament. Higher upon the middle part of the Ba&s;is, are other Ba&s;&s;o-relievoes en|graven on the Four &s;ides: On one is the Emperour <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> hold|ing a Wreath in his Hand, with a great Croud of Souldiers about him. On another, is repre&s;ented a great Company, rejoycing with Mu&s;ick of &s;everal &s;orts. On another, is repre&s;ented the Emperour, &s;eated on a Throne with his Two Sons, <HI>Honorius</HI> and <HI>Arcadius,</HI> attended on by the re&s;t of his Nobility: But our time would not permit us to de|&s;igne any more than what I have given you.</P>

<P>From the Hippodrome, we were conducted into a great &s;quare Court, I believe twice as long as broad; which is inclo&s;ed with Four Ranges of low Buildings, but covered with Lead in many &s;mall Cuppaloes, which makes it look very graceful.

In the Middle of this great Court, is built the Mo&s;que it &s;elf, exactly &s;quare, having another &s;quare Court on the We&s;tern-&s;ide of it, which makes the whole oblong. This Court hath Three Gates, which are mounted up to by a dozen of Steps; and is en|compa&s;&s;ed within with a Cloy&s;ter, &s;u&s;tained by antient Marble Pillars, of &s;everal Colours.

Before the great Entrance is a Portico, &s;u&s;tained likewi&s;e by &s;tately antient Marble Pillars, having a Soffa at each Hand, for the People to &s;it, and do their Devotions under; and where the Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Mahometan</HI>

Between the&s;e is the great Door, con&s;i&s;ting of folding Leaves, covered with Bra&s;s; which lets you into a Magnificent &s;quare Building, covered with a great Cuppalo in the Middle, &s;u&s;tained by Four white Marble Pillars, Seventy of my Spans about; who&s;e heighth I judge not to be above double the Dia|meter. The&s;e Pillars are chanelled, but not after our Mode, which is carved deep into the Stone, whereas the&s;e are carved in Relievo, or Stripes, &s;itting higher than the re&s;t of the Stone; but look altogether as Beautiful.</P>
<P>To this middle Cuppalo, are joyned Four half Cuppaloes, of the &s;ame Diameter with the middle one; but much lower: to which, a &s;mal|ler Cuppalo being fitted to each Corner, the whole &s;quare Area is co|vered in a mo&s;t &s;plendid manner with Lead, adorned on the Top with gilded Globes, and Spires, &s;u&s;taining &s;o many Cre&s;cents, the Badge or En&s;ign of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. It is flagged al&s;o within with white Marble, and paved in like manner.</P>
<P>To all this, are erected Six exceeding hig, and &s;lender Steeples or Spires, which look like our Pillar at <HI>London,</HI> built in memory of the Fire. They are chanelled al&s;o, but end in a gilded Spire, &s;u&s;taining a Cre&s;cent. They are placed Two at the We&s;tern-Corners of the Court, Two at the Front of the Mo&s;que, and Two behind. About the middle of each of them, there are Three Balconies, or Galleries, one above the other; to which their Prie&s;ts a&s;cend by a winding pair of Stairs, to &s;ound forth their &s;hrill Voices, at &s;everal Times of the Night, and Day, to call the People to their Devotions. The&s;e al&s;o, at their Fea&s;ts, New Moons, and &s;olemn Occa&s;ions, they hang round with Lamps; which being lighted at Night, make a very &s;plendid. Show at a di&s;tance; as I of|ten ob&s;erved from <HI>Gallata:</HI> they being lighted almo&s;t every Night whil&s;t I was there, by rea&s;on of the Plague then raging in a more than ordinary manner.</P>
<P>This is the only Royal Mo&s;que I ob&s;erved to have Six Spires; the re&s;t have Four a piece, or at lea&s;t Two; but the ordinary Mo&s;ques have u&s;ually but One. This Mo&s;que is adorned within after this manner: The Floor is covered with fine Indian Mats, and Turkey-work Car|pets; becau&s;e they &s;lip off their Papuchas, or Shoes, when they go in to do their Devotions. The Roof, Seven or Eight Foot from the Ground, is hung with many great Circles of Lamps, one within ano|ther, intermixed with Lu&s;tres, or Balls of Gla&s;s; and &s;everal other pretty Curio&s;ities, which, when lighted at their Evening Devotions, mu&s;t needs make a &s;plendid Show. There is a Chair, with a Desk on the Left Hand, where the <HI>Mufti</HI> reads, and expounds the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> and on the other Side, there goes up a little narrow pair of Stairs, on the Top of which they read their Prayers. Between the&s;e, and on the Ea&s;t, or South-Ea&s;t-End, is a place made in the Wall, formed like a Niche, to &s;et a large Statue in, with the Bottom even with the Ground. On each Hand of this Niche &s;tands a very great Wax-Candle, in a pro|portionable Bra&s;s Candle-&s;tick. Within the Niche, in <HI>Arabick</HI> Chara|cters, is written the Form of the Mahometan Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith. To|wards this they alwayes turn their Faces, when they &s;ay their Pray|ers; which, I believe, is towards <HI>Mecha,</HI> their Prophets Tomb; becau&s;e,
<PB N="188" REF="61">when they turn a Church into a Mo&s;que, which &s;tands due Ea&s;t and We&s;t, they alwaies make &s;uch a Niche on purpo&s;e, on the Southern-Wall, as I ob&s;erved in S^t <HI>John</HI>'s Church at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and the Temple of <HI>Miner|va</HI> at <HI>Athens.</HI> This is called the New Mo&s;que, although &s;everal very &s;tately ones have been built &s;ince; e&s;pecially one lately by the Sulta|ne&s;s, Mother to the pre&s;ent Emperour, &s;ituate upon the Harbour, near the Garden-Gate; which, although it be not inclo&s;ed within an out|ward Court like <HI>Achmet</HI>'s, it is neverthele&s;s very Magnificent, and hath its peculiar Beauties and Ornaments: For although its Architecture be not according to our Rules, it wants not either Beauty or Regu|larity. Its Figure, Roof of Cuppaloes, Court and Fountain, is like the former; as al&s;o, the tall and gilded Spires, although not &s;o many in number. The &s;quare Court before it hath a Fountain, and is al&s;o &s;urrounded with a Portico, &s;u&s;tained by Beautiful Pillars of divers co|loured Marble, &s;ome white, &s;ome &s;peckled; but the Two at the En|trance into the Mo&s;que, are of Ja&s;per, admirably well poli&s;hed, and proportioned. But this was not done by the Turki&s;h Art; but of an|tient Times being brought from the Ruins of <HI>Troy,</HI> or <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The Walls and Pillars within, are faced with blue and white Purat Tiles, as the <HI>French</HI> King's Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> called the <HI>Trianons,</HI> is without. The Frize that rangeth about the Cuppalo with|in, is plain; but well proportioned, and of white Marble. The Gla&s;&s;es of their Lamps, making a &s;econd Roof within, by the many Circles one within another, are adorned with Flowers; which kind of Paint is not forbidden by their Law, as that of Animals is. They are intermixed al&s;o with Gla&s;s Balls, curious pieces of wrought Ivory, gilded Ve&s;&s;els, models of other Mo&s;ques, and many other pretty De|vices; which mu&s;t needs make a mo&s;t &s;plendid Show, when the Lamps are lighted at their Night-&s;ervice: But this is too dangerous an At|tempt, for a Chri&s;tian Curio&s;ity to venture to &s;ee. Although at other times, by-vertue of a &s;mall Reward to the Keeper, you may &s;ee any Mo&s;que there. On each hand from the Entrance, is a Gallery &s;u&s;tain|ed by Marble Pillars, the Floor being &s;trewed with Carpets and Mats; and having a Pulpit or Desk-&s;tairs, to read Prayers, and a Niche, to|wards which they pray, as <HI>Achmet</HI>'s, and as indeed all other Mo&s;ques have; for the Ornaments are much the &s;ame in all, only the Difference is in the Co&s;t, Beauty, and Magnificence: So that, when one hath &s;een the Two or Three be&s;t, one hath &s;een more than all contained in the re&s;t. Therefore, this &s;hall &s;uffice for the De&s;cription of the Mo&s;ques.</P>

It is very like tho&s;e at <HI>Rome,</HI> of the Emperours <HI>Trajan</HI> and <HI>Antonine;</HI> but I will not compare its Ba&s;&s;o-relievo to theirs, for Excellency of Work: Although great Art hath been &s;hewn, to make the Figures ap|pear of an equal Bigne&s;s to the Eye, at all the Di&s;tances; and, to give it its due, is far better than the u&s;ual Carving of the&s;e latter Times. The Heighth that <HI>P. Jilius</HI> took of it, was One hundred and forty &s;e|ven Foot, which excels that of <HI>Trajan</HI>'s by Nineteen <HI>Roman</HI> Feet; but <HI>Antonine</HI>'s Pillar is higher than this, by thirteen Foot. Three &s;ides of the Ba&s;is are carved with Trophies; and, on the Northern-&s;ide, I &s;up|po&s;e, was an In&s;cription; but quite eaten away by that penetrating Wind. On the South-&s;ide, on the highe&s;t part of the Ba&s;is, in a Wreath, &s;u&s;tained by two Victories, is the <HI>Labarum;</HI> which is a Knot, con&s;i&s;ting of the fir&s;t Letters of <GAP DESC="foreign">, which the Chri&s;tian Emperours, from <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> placed in their Banners, in&s;tead of the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagle. Below that, are the Effigies of the Emperours, <HI>Honorius</HI> and <HI>Arcadi|us;</HI> to the Honour of whom this Pillar was Erected, crowned with flying Victories, and accompanied by many of their Nobility. On the Third Rank are &s;everal Victories; &s;ome Leading, and others Driving;
<PB N="190" REF="62">&s;everal Figures, each crowned with a Crown, much repre&s;enting &s;o ma|ny Cities conquered by tho&s;e Emperours.</P>

<P>We&s;t-ward of the Hippodrome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE POR|PHYRY, OR CONSTAN|TINE'S PIL|LAR.</NOTE> in the great Street, leading towards <HI>Adrianople,</HI> &s;tands a high Pillar of &s;everal pieces of Porphyry, bound about the Joynts, with Hoops of Bra&s;s.

<P>Our Guide, to &s;hew us the Curio&s;ities of this Place, told us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MARCIAN'S PILLAR.</NOTE> He knew of another Pillar in the City, which no Stranger had yet &s;een; in which, I believe, he told true; for I find none that have taken notice of it, before us: It is the Monument of the Emperour <HI>Mar|cianus,</HI> as the In&s;cription on the Ba&s;is informed us; although hard to be read, by rea&s;on the Letters were made of &s;ome Mettal; which is all picked off, and the Holes only, with &s;ome &s;trokes of the Letters, now remain. The Ba&s;is, and Pillar, is of Granite Marble; but the Ca|pital is of white, and of the <HI>Corinthen</HI> Order. On the top is an Urn of white Marble, carved at the Corners with Eagles. We judged, it might contain his Heart, becau&s;e the Burning of dead Bodies was never u&s;ed by Chri&s;tians. The In&s;cription intimates, that the Statue of this Emperour was there placed, I &s;uppo&s;e, on the Top of the Pillar, on the Urn; and that <HI>Tatianus</HI> erected this Monument, who was undoubt|edly the &s;ame that a&s;&s;ured him, he &s;hould be Emperour, when as yet he was but a private Souldier; having with his Brother <HI>Julio,</HI> &s;een an Eagle &s;it over him, and &s;hadowing him from the Sun with his Wings, when he was fallen a&s;leep in the Field, being wearied with Hunting: For which, &s;o &s;oon as the Event verified the good Omen, he made <HI>Tatianus</HI> Governour of the City, and <HI>Julio</HI> he made Governour of the Province of <HI>Illyria. Zonaras</HI> gives him the Character of an Excellent Prince; in who&s;e time <HI>Ar&s;enius</HI> was Patriarch of <HI>con&s;tantinople,</HI> and by who&s;e Command, Favour, and Protection, the Fourth General Council was a&s;&s;embled, and held at <HI>Chalcedon;</HI> wherein the Here&s;ies of <HI>Eutyches</HI> and <HI>Dio&s;corus</HI> were condemned, and the Verity of the Divine and Humane Nature of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> without Confu&s;ion of Sub&s;tance, was a&s;&s;erted. This Pillar is now &s;tanding in the Court of a private Hou&s;e,
<PB N="192" REF="63">joyning to the Bath of <HI>Ibrahim Ba&s;ha,</HI> near the <HI>Odas</HI> of the Janizaries, which is about Mid-way between the <HI>Hippodrome</HI> and <HI>Adrianople</HI> Gate, not far from the great Street.</P>
<P>When we were in this part of the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE JANI|ZARIES QUARTERS.</NOTE> we went to &s;ee the Quar|ters of the Janizaries, which are two great Buildings near together, without any great Beauty or Ornament; but capable of receiving of a great number of Men; where all that Order ought to inhabit toge|ther, and live Batchellors: But now they leave off the &s;trictne&s;s of that Di&s;cipline, great part of them having only their Names enrolled in their Books, and receive the Grand Signior's Pay; but Marry, follow Trades, and re&s;ide in their own Hou&s;es, up and down the Town. They are two oblong Courts, with a &s;mall Mo&s;que, or Chappel, in the middle of them, where tho&s;e that re&s;ide there, daily do their Devoti|ons.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of Inns in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">KANS.</NOTE> and indeed all over <HI>Turkey,</HI> they have publick Buildings, they call <HI>Karavan Serais,</HI> or <HI>Kans,</HI> erected in convenient Parts of the City for the Markets, and Traffick of diffe|rent Commodities. The&s;e are for all Men of what Quality, Conditi|on, Country, or Religion &s;oever; and there the Poore&s;t have room to lodge in, and the Riche&s;t have no more: As to their Beds and Entertainment, they mu&s;t bring and provide them them&s;elves, or lodge on the Floor, or (at mo&s;t) on a Mat; which, in &s;ome <HI>Kans,</HI> the Kan-keeper is obliged to provide.</P>
<P>They are of two &s;orts; the old Fa&s;hion ones are but like a great Barn, without any Partitions, or Di&s;tinctions of Rooms or Lodgings: They have only round the Wall, a Bank rai&s;ed about a Foot and half high from the Ground, kept from falling down by a Wall of the &s;ame height, paved on the Top, and about &s;even or eight Foot broad. At four or five Yards di&s;tance round the Wall, are placed &s;mall Chimneys: Between which, they lay their Beds; tying their Hor&s;es, and giving them Meat at their Feet.</P>
<P>But the other <HI>Kans,</HI> of later Building, and in great Cities, are more &s;tately; they are u&s;ually built in the Form of a Quadrangle, with Two, and &s;ometimes Three Stories one above the other; covered with &s;o many Leaded Cuppaloes, as it is divided into Appartments, of about ten Foot &s;quare; where each Company keep their Concerns private to them&s;elves, with as great Convenience as their manner of Life will permit. And about them, there are commonly Attendance; who, for a &s;mall Vale, will provide you &s;uch things as you have Oc|ca&s;ion for. So many Stories as they are high, &s;o many Galleries are built one above another, round the <HI>Kan,</HI> into which the&s;e little Cham|bers open.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Kans</HI> look very &s;tately without, and are not ungrateful to the Sight within; They are u&s;ually built of Stone, having a large Gate to enter into them; and in the middle of the Area, is built a &s;mall Mo&s;que, or Chappel, to do their Devotion in; &s;upply'd with Water both for Religious, and Nece&s;&s;ary U&s;es. In my Opinion, they might be accommodated to the U&s;e of our Chri&s;tian Countries. For the ge|nerality of Inns, Taverns, and Ale-hou&s;es are grown &s;uch Places of all manner of Debaucheries, that I am &s;ure, they are become the Shame of
<PB N="193" REF="63">our Religion, if not of the Policies of mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Countries: For they not only harbour Prophanene&s;s, Luxury, and Debauchery; but are the Receptacles of idle and &s;lothful Per&s;ons; and indeed, of Out|lanes, Thieves, and Robbers: Their Keepers extorting for their En|tertainment, Rates without Rea&s;on or Mode&s;ty; and, in a word, are the De&s;truction of the Souls, Bodies, and E&s;tates of many Thou&s;ands, not only of Poor, but Rich al&s;o; and when all this is done, they oftner die Beggars, than Rich Men them&s;elves: Whereas, if &s;uch Pla|ces as the&s;e were erected in convenient Places of the Roads, in Cities, and in Market-Towns, and put into the Hands of hone&s;t poor Men, to &s;erve Strangers, Travellers, and Trade&s;men: Poor Men might do their Bu&s;ine&s;s with greater Expedition, and le&s;s Charge; carry home their Gains to their Wives and Children, and not &s;pend them before they return from Market. Here Rich Men might have provided for the nece&s;&s;ary Conveniences of their Journeys without Extravagances, have Opportunity to be Charitable, and by their Examples of Devo|tion, and Chri&s;tian Behaviour, give Glory to <HI>God</HI> their Creatour, and mighty Redeemer: e&s;pecially if they had Chappels and Chaplains, with a convenient Stipend annexed to them.</P>
<P>The Exchange, which they call the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or <HI>Beze&s;tan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BAZAR.</NOTE> is al&s;o a Beau|tiful Building, roofed with Cuppalo's, covered with Lead, &s;u&s;tained by many Arches and Pillars within, and is &s;ituate toward the We&s;tern part of the City. The chief Trade in it, con&s;i&s;ting in Fur-Gowns, Ve&s;ts, fine Saddles and Bridles, Semiters, and other Armour. We &s;oon wi&s;hed our &s;elves out of it; it was &s;o crouded with Brokers that &s;old old Cloaths, we apprehended were of tho&s;e who dyed of the Plague.</P>
<P>The Publick Bagnios, or Baths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAGNIOS.</NOTE> are none of the &s;malle&s;t Ornaments of this City. The&s;e are u&s;ually placed near their Mo&s;ques, becau&s;e they u&s;e them in clean&s;ing them&s;elves, according to their Super&s;tition, as well as for the Health of their Bodies; being their chief Remedy in all their Di&s;ea&s;es, as really they are the be&s;t Phy&s;ick of their Coun|try. We went to &s;ee only one of the&s;e near the Mo&s;que of the Sul|tan's Mother; becau&s;e the Plague was &s;o much in the City, and the&s;e much frequented by the Infected. They have a Room without, with a Sopha round it, to undre&s;s them&s;elves; and a large &s;quare Room beyond that, covered with a Cuppalo, thorough which the Light is let by Bell-gla&s;&s;es; and about it are many little Appartments, cove|red with &s;mall Cuppalo's, much re&s;embling that built in <HI>London;</HI> only they have u&s;ually a great Ba&s;on in the Middle, filled with hot Wa|ter, into which they go to bathe them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the Water one day, to &s;ee the Antient Aqueduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OLD AQUEDUCT.</NOTE> that joyns the two Hills together; on which the Mo&s;ques of <HI>Suleman,</HI> and <HI>Bajazet</HI> &s;tand; of which we had a fair Pro&s;pect from <HI>Gallata.</HI> It is built &s;trong and high, with large Arches one above the other, in the deepe&s;t part of the Valley: but is now di&s;-joyned from the Ea&s;tern Hill, and of no pre&s;ent U&s;e. The Water being now conveyed about the City by Pipes under Ground: But the Aqueducts, that bring the Water to the City, are very Magnificent; of which, more hereafter.</P>
<P>We took a Barge another day, and went to &s;ee the Seven Towers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEVEN TOWERS.</NOTE>
<PB N="194" REF="64">as they call a Ca&s;tle &s;ituate in that Angle of the City neare&s;t the <HI>Pro|pontis,</HI> becau&s;e it bath &s;o many eminent Spired Towers.</P>
<P>In our way, we put a Shore on the Seraglio point; where towards the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> is a Plat-form, planted with a great many Cannons, the Spoils taken in their Wars from the Chri&s;tians, and <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> &s;ome we ob&s;erved with &s;uch a va&s;t Bore, as are capable to fling Stones of near ten foot diameter: Near this Point we ob&s;erved &s;everal Rocks and Shelves, lying but little below the Surface of the Water; which mu&s;t needs be very dangerous to any Ve&s;&s;els, that either by the Wind or Current &s;hall be drove upon them. When we came to the Seven Towers, we were not permitted Entrance, by rea&s;on that a Knight of <HI>Malta</HI> had made his E&s;cape thence not long before; whereupon it was ordered, that no Franck &s;hould enter there any more. We were only permitted to go round it; and all we ob&s;erved, was an antient Gate, looking towards the <HI>Propontis,</HI> adorned with Ba&s;&s;o-relievo's on oblong Tables of white Marble. On one is the Fall of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> on another <HI>Hercules</HI> fighting with a Bull, on another <HI>Hercules</HI> in combat with <HI>Cerberus;</HI> and on another, <HI>Venus</HI> coming to vi&s;it <HI>Adonis</HI> &s;leeping; with &s;ome others we knew not what they &s;ignified. This Gate is now quite &s;topped up, and no Entrance that way. Hard by, over a little Gate of the City, which from the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> leads to the Seven Towers, we ob&s;erved this In&s;cription, with the Letters curiou&s;ly joyned to each other in knots, hardly to be explicated:
<Q>&Agr;&Ngr;&Egr;&Kgr;&Agr;&Igr;&Ngr;&Igr;&Sgr;&THgr;&Egr; &Egr;&Pgr;&Igr; &Bgr;&Agr;&Sgr;&Igr;&Lgr;&Egr;&Ogr;&Ugr; &Kgr;&Agr;&Igr; &Kgr;&Ogr;&Ngr;&Sgr;&Tgr;&Agr;&Ngr;&Tgr;&Igr;&Ngr;&Ogr;&Ugr; &Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Pgr;&Ogr;&Rgr;&PHgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Ogr;&Ggr;&Egr;&Ngr;&Ngr;&EEgr;&Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr;<LB>
&Pgr; &THgr;&Igr;&Lgr;&Ogr;&KHgr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Sgr;&Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Kgr;&Agr;&Igr; &Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Dgr;&Egr;&Sgr;&Pgr;&Ogr; &Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Pgr;&Egr;&Ngr; &Egr;&Tgr;&Egr; &Kgr;. &PHgr;. &Kgr;. &Agr;.&dagger;</Q>
Which imports, that the Gate was rebuilt by <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine Porphyrogenites;</HI> Emperours in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the year &mdash;</P>
<P>This Place looks not &s;trong enough for a Ca&s;tle, but is &s;ufficiently &s;o for a Pri&s;on; which is the Imployment they now put it to, and that only for great Men, or great Malefactors, like the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as our Convenience would permit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PATRIARCH AT BALLATA.</NOTE> we went to wait on the Patriarch of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who was then named <HI>Parthenius;</HI> to de|liver him the Pre&s;ent of Books, which we had received from the Proto|pappa of <HI>Corfu</HI> for him; and to &s;ee in what &s;tate &s;o great a Prelate of the Church lived, and was reduced to. His Palace and Church is at a quarter of the Town called <HI>Ballata,</HI> which mu&s;t not be mi&s;taken for <HI>Gallata:</HI> It is &s;ituated near the We&s;tern Corner of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> ad|joyning to the Harbour, and is allotted to the Patriarch and <HI>Greek</HI> Chri&s;tians. We &s;aluted him at his coming out of the Church, accord|ing to the <HI>Greek</HI> Cu&s;tom, with low Reverence, ki&s;&s;ing his Hand, or Chappelet; fir&s;t putting it to the Mouth, and then to the Fore-head. His u&s;ual Habit differeth not from the ordinary <HI>Caloyers,</HI> or Monks of the Order of S^t <HI>Ba&s;il;</HI> out of which the Bi&s;hops, and Patriarchs are cho&s;en; it being a black &s;erge Ca&s;&s;ock, or Ve&s;t, down to the ground, a black Cap, with a black Cypre&s;s, or curled Scarf wound a|bout it; as the other Bi&s;hops and <HI>Egoumeno's,</HI> or Abbots, often do
<PB N="195" REF="64">wear. He liveth but ob&s;curely; his Palace being no better, than the wor&s;er &s;ort of our Par&s;onage Hou&s;es. The Patriarchal Church is but a &s;mall, ob&s;cure Edifice, without any great Ornament or Beauty. For the <HI>Greek</HI> Church is trampled upon here, as well as in all other the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions. They keep in it part of the Pillar (they &s;ay) our Saviour was tied to, when &s;courged by <HI>Pontius Pilate.</HI></P>
<P>The Patriarchs depend on the Grand Signior, both as to their Spi|ritual and Civil Juri&s;diction: For they are likewi&s;e Judges in Civil Matters, between Chri&s;tian and Chri&s;tian. They buy this Dignity dear, and po&s;&s;e&s;s it with great hazard: Yet &s;o ambitious are the <HI>Greek</HI> Cler|gy of it, that the Bi&s;hops are always buying it over one anothers Heads, from the Grand Vizier; who de&s;ires no better Sport, than to &s;ee them &s;trive who &s;hall bring mo&s;t Gri&s;ts to his Mill. They pur|cha&s;e this Dignity with very great Sums of Money; which are a|gain to be pre&s;&s;ed out of the poor <HI>Greek</HI> Chri&s;tians: and when obtain|ed, it is no longer &s;ecured to them, than till the Ambition of another Bi&s;hop offers more for it, or impeacheth this Incumbent with Crimes &s;ufficient for a Pretext to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him: Which the Vizier greedily catcheth at, (right or wrong) to the Ruin of the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: Yet the Bi&s;hops are &s;till canva&s;ing for it; in&s;omuch, that in the &s;pace of five Years, they had changed the Patriarch five times; &s;ome of them being executed, and others having made their E&s;cape; of whom I &s;aw one at <HI>Zant,</HI> and another (they &s;ay) is at <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>The Authority which they thus obtain by Simony, they maintain by Tyranny: For as &s;oon as they are promoted, they &s;end to all their Bi&s;hops, to contribute to the Sum they have disbur&s;ed for their Pre|ferment; and &s;uch as deny, they depo&s;e, and &s;end others to their Charge. Again, the Bi&s;hops &s;end to their inferiour Clergy; who are forced to do the &s;ame to the poor People, or to &s;pare it out of their Wives and Childrens Mouths. But many times they engage for more, than they can perform; and bring the Church &s;o much in debt to the <HI>Turk,</HI> that its Ruin is daily threatned thereby; which, without <HI>God</HI>'s great Mercy uphold it, cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. I was informed, that <HI>Patriarch Parthenius</HI> was then owing fifty Pur&s;es of Dollers, each Pur&s;e containing five hundred; which amounteth to twenty five thou&s;and, making in Engli&s;h Money about &s;ix thou&s;and pound: which to rai&s;e in the great Poverty that Church is in, will be a greater dif|ficulty to him, than it was to be made Patriarch. We had but a &s;hort Conference with his <HI>All holine&s;s,</HI> which is the Title they give him in Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. As to their ordinary Bi&s;hops, they &s;ay <GAP DESC="foreign">, your <HI>All-prie&s;t&s;hip,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign">, your <HI>Beatitude;</HI> and to every inferiour Prie&s;t, <GAP DESC="foreign">, your <HI>Holine&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> We de&s;ired to &s;ee his Library, hoping to find many good Manu&s;cripts in it: But he informed us, That he had but few, or no Books at all: though in a Paper-&s;hop hard by his Door, we bought about twenty or thirty antient <HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts; of which I may perhaps at &s;ome other time, give the World an Account.</P>
<P>It would be pertinent in this Place, to give &s;ome &s;hort View of the State, and Religion of this Church: But that Subject having been &s;o amply and ingenuou&s;ly handled by Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ricaut,</HI> I
<PB N="196" REF="65">&s;hall only at pre&s;ent make &s;ome Remarks on their Opinion of the Eu|chari&s;t; which has been &s;o much and long controverted between late Writers of the Romi&s;h and Prote&s;tant Church: and that I &s;hall do with the &s;ame Sincerity and Frankne&s;s, as I had my Informations from Bi&s;hops, <HI>Caloyers,</HI> and other Religious Men of that Communion, with whom I conver&s;ed in &s;everal places of my Journey.</P>
<P>The Euchari&s;t, or Holy Communion, is the Sacrament, in which they &s;hew mo&s;t of their Devotion; it being the chiefe&s;t Part of their Religious Wor&s;hip; wherein they expre&s;s the whole My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, as the Death, Pa&s;&s;ion, Re&s;urrection, and A&s;cen&s;ion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> into Heaven.</P>
<P>They u&s;e ordinary Leavened Bread, made in form of a Loaf, and &s;tamped upon the top with the Sign of the Cro&s;s, in this man|ner:

</FIGURE>Which &s;ignifies <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> overcame. This they cut out of the Loaf, at a little Altar on the right hand of the other; which they call <HI>Pro|the&s;is,</HI> and bring it cover'd to the great Altar, which they call <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the Holy Table: Where, after &s;everal Ceremonies and Prayers, as may be &s;een in their Liturgies, the Prie&s;t breaks it into four pieces: one of which, neare&s;t to him on the right hand, he him|&s;elf takes, and putteth into the Hollow of his hand, and covering it with the other, &s;aith a Prayer to him&s;elf, bowing his Head and Body very low: Afterwards, &s;tanding up right, maketh the Sign of the Cro&s;s with both his hands &s;o clo&s;ed; and after bowing, putteth it to his Mouth with both hands, without looking upon it. Then he putteth the re&s;t of the Bread into the Cup; of which he giveth with a Spoon
<PB N="197" REF="65">both Bread and Wine together, to any that will Communicate. If there be none, he taketh it all him&s;elf, not leaving any to be &s;et by: For they Con&s;ecrate once a Year only, to Communicate to the Sick; and that is done on the day before <HI>Good Friday.</HI> This Con&s;ecrated Bread, being dipped in the Wine, is dried again, and kept in a Bag or Box, in &s;ome convenient place of the Church, for &s;uch Occa&s;ions, without any Re&s;pect performed to it, that I ever ob&s;erved in the true <HI>Greek</HI> Church: By the <HI>True Greek Church,</HI> I mean tho&s;e that are not mixed with the <HI>Latins;</HI> as they are at <HI>Corfu</HI> and <HI>Zant,</HI> and mo&s;t pla|ces under the <HI>Venetian</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>As to their Faith concerning this My&s;tery, I cannot take upon me to determine: For it hath been a Que&s;tion well handled already between two learned Men of the Roman and Reformed Churches of <HI>France, viz.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Arnauld,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Claud;</HI> by whom Authors have been examined with much Diligence on both &s;ides: Wherein Mon&s;ieur <HI>Claud</HI> &s;eemeth to be victorious from their Writings, and the Reports of Travellers of this la&s;t Age: Though by a new Confe&s;&s;ion, brought about by the Marque&s;s <HI>de Nanteulle,</HI> French Amba&s;&s;ador now at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> (who with great Zeal did pro&s;ecute that De&s;ign) Mon&s;ieur <HI>Arnauld</HI> &s;eemeth to triumph: Of which the World will have an Account one day, I hope, from Dr. <HI>Covel,</HI> who was Chap|lain to the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour, Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> at the &s;ame time when that Bu&s;ine&s;s was acted, and hath particularly informed him&s;elf about it.

<P>However, I think, it is an hard Que&s;tion to determine of their pre|&s;ent Faith; and of very little con&s;equence, unle&s;s they could prove that they ever did believe <HI>Tran&s;ubstantiation:</HI> which will be impo&s;|&s;ible to be done, as is apparent from what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Claud</HI> hath writ|ten concerning that Subject. It will be very difficult to prove it their pre&s;ent Belief, becau&s;e they are &s;o very unlearned, that they hardly know the Principles of their Faith; and I could not find, that <HI>Tran|&s;ubstantiation</HI> hath been heard of, except among&s;t tho&s;e that have con|ver&s;ed with the Roman Church. <HI>Of little con&s;equence</HI> I &s;ay: For, What Argument can it be again&s;t the &s;ure Foundations of the Reformed Churches, to have prevailed upon the gro&s;s Ignorance of that poor de|pre&s;&s;ed Nation, by impo&s;ing tho&s;e Opinions upon them, as if they had been from the Beginning the Doctrines of their Church, and where|in they ever agreed with that of <HI>Rome.</HI> This Fruit indeed, the Semi|naries (and Mi&s;&s;ioners from them in all places of the&s;e Parts) may bring forth: And it were to be wi&s;hed, that the Prote&s;tant Princes had been as diligent to have informed them in the Truth. But it is the Fortune <HI>of the Children of Darkne&s;s</HI> to be cunninger in this World, than the <HI>Children of Light.</HI></P>
<P>I had not very frequent Opportunity, to examine this Matter well; but where I had, I commonly did. At <HI>Corfu</HI> and <HI>Zant;</HI> they are mo&s;t certainly of the <HI>Roman</HI> Opinion, as to this; although profe&s;&s;ed Ene|mies to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and Pope, in the points of Infallibility, and Proce&s;&s;ion of the Holy Spirit. At <HI>Tine</HI> they are mo&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="66">Religion; and the <HI>Greeks</HI> u&s;e their own Liturgies and Ceremonies; but are governed by a <HI>Latine</HI> Bi&s;hop. <HI>Micone</HI> hath a <HI>Greek</HI> Bi&s;hop, and is &s;ubject to the Patriarch. The Bi&s;hop of it, then reigning, came to <HI>Constantinople</HI> with us; but for want of Language, I had but little di&s;cour&s;e with him: But he had a Prie&s;t waiting on him, that &s;poke <HI>Italian;</HI> with whom I &s;ometimes di&s;cour&s;ed. He talked, as if he had never heard of &s;uch Doctrine; much le&s;s believed, that the Bread by Con&s;ecration was really changed into the Body of <HI>Christ;</HI> and &s;eem|ed plainly to under&s;tand a My&s;tical and Spiritual Sen&s;e in it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Athens</HI> I often conver&s;ed with the Arch-Bi&s;hop, who was then one called <HI>Antenos.</HI> He affirmed to me, That he was pre&s;ent at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> when the Patriarch &s;igned that Writing to the Marque&s;s of <HI>Nanteulle,</HI> that he was one of that A&s;&s;embly him&s;elf, and that they believed according to that Writing; wherein the Article of <HI>Tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed by that word <GAP DESC="foreign">, though I do not find, that ever that word was known till then, to the <HI>Greek</HI> Church:) I asked him, Whether he did not under&s;tand it <GAP DESC="foreign">, (Spiritual|ly?) he an&s;wered no; but <GAP DESC="foreign">, Corporally; that is to &s;ay, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>corporally</HI> in the Sacrament.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was at the Convent of S^t <HI>Luke</HI>'s by <HI>Livadia</HI> in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> there happened to come thither the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salona;</HI> with whom I had frequent di&s;cour&s;e upon that Subject. He &s;eemed de&s;irous, when I told him, That I was of <HI>England,</HI> to know the Faith of our Church; of which, when I had given him the be&s;t Account I could, he told me, that it was the &s;ame with theirs: For I informed him, That we believed the Holy Scriptures, the Apo&s;tles Creed, the <HI>Nicene,</HI> and that of S^t <HI>Athana&s;ius;</HI> That our Church was governed by Bi&s;hops and Arch-Bi&s;hops; That our Faith was conformable to the Primitive Fa|thers, and the fir&s;t General Councils, until the fir&s;t five or &s;ix Centu|ries; and in fine, That we were not of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. After this, I asked him their Opinion concerning the Holy Sacra|ment, and what they held the Bread and Wine to be after Con|&s;ecration; he an&s;wered, The Body and Blood of Chri&s;t. When I asked him, <HI>How that could be?</HI> he gave me this Explicati|on; As the Sun is in Heaven, and yet gives Light and Heat to the whole Earth; &s;o Chri&s;t, although in Heaven, yet was in the Sacra|ment by his Divine Power and Influence. I told him, <HI>That that was as we believed;</HI> which was, that Chri&s;t was in the Sacrament after a &s;piritual manner. He &s;aid, It was the &s;ame the <HI>Greek</HI> Church believed; and was &s;o obliging to me thereupon, that he would needs have or|dained me Prie&s;t the next day; which, as it is really the mo&s;t ho|nourable Employment a Chri&s;tian can be capable of; &s;o among&s;t them it is mo&s;t highly e&s;teemed: and I had much adoe to excu&s;e my &s;elf, by acknowledging my Unworthine&s;s of &s;o great an Honour.</P>
<P>This was the general Judgment of that whole Covent, and of an Hermit, that liveth about a Mile from thence in great au&s;terity, and held by them to be a Saint. There was a Father, who was Native of <HI>Zant;</HI> but came away from thence &s;o young, that he was not imbued with their Prin|ciples there. When I asked him, Whether they believed that the Bread and Wine was changed into the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t? he an&s;we|red
<PB N="199" REF="66">me, Whether I thought them &s;o much Bea&s;ts, as to believe &s;uch an Ab&s;urdity? The only thing they &s;eemed mo&s;t to di&s;like in us, and our Religion, was, That I would not make any Reverence to the Pi|ctures that are in their Churches; which they always do, when they come to their Devotions. They never kneel in their Wor&s;hip; but bend their Bodies down to the Ground, making the Sign of the Cro&s;s with their right hand, fir&s;t on their Head, then on each &s;ide of their Brea&s;ts, and then down to the Ground, as they bow.</P>
<P>I believe that this Convent, and the mo&s;t inland Parts of <HI>Greece,</HI> are yet free from that Opinion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and have not been tamper'd with by them.</P>
<P>I have made no other Remarks of the <HI>Turks</HI> Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TURKS RE|LIGION and LEARNING.</NOTE> but what have been already ob&s;erved. Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> a Scotchman, who hath tra|velled tho&s;e Parts for four or five Years together, and hath perfected him&s;elf in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Languages, &s;urprized my Compa|nion and me with an Account he gave of their Learning, beyond the ordinary Opinion of the World. He a&s;&s;ured us, That at <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI> there was a <HI>Bazar</HI> (or Exchange) for Manu&s;cript Books (for they &s;uffer no Printing) of different Sciences, in the <HI>Turki&s;h, Arabian,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Languages; the two la&s;t beeing their learned Languages, as <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> are in Chri&s;tendom; but that it was dangerous for Chri&s;tians to frequent them; as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> was made &s;en&s;ible, when we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Pro&s;a.</HI> For &s;eeing &s;ome <HI>Arabick</HI> Manu&s;cripts, he would have cheapned them; but was reproachfully &s;ent away with the Name of <HI>Goure,</HI> or <HI>Infidel.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> a&s;&s;ured us, that they keep annual Regi&s;ters of all things that pa&s;s throughout the whole Extent of their Empire; and of the Wars they have with their Neighbouring Countries: That one might have a Copy of the&s;e Annals in five or &s;ix great Volums, for Two hundred Crowns: That there are Hi&s;torians and Writers, who have a Salary for writing, in the Seraglio: That there was another good Book to be had, concerning the Government of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; and that he him&s;elf had bought a Che&s;t full of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Books; among which he had many very rare pieces; as one of <HI>Chek-Bouni,</HI> an Egyptian, concerning the Vertue of <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Human Words,</HI> full of Figures and Lines; by which he pretends to do abun|dance of curious tricks by <HI>Anagrams.</HI></P>
<P>Another that &s;heweth the Theory of the Cabali&s;tick Art. A Dictio|nary in <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Arabick:</HI> A Book of Songs, wherein there are many very antient ones, as of <HI>Avicen</HI> and <HI>Albucherche; Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Grammers, with Alphabets of all Languages. A Book of all the Revo|lutions of the Kingdom of <HI>Egypt,</HI> written by a Cheke, or Doctor of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> a great A&s;trologer; who&s;e Predictions have alwayes pro|ved &s;o true, that when <HI>Sultan Selim</HI> made War again&s;t the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> all that King's Coun&s;ellors told him, That it was but Folly to re&s;i&s;t, (although he had a very pui&s;&s;ant Army, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Moors, Arabs,</HI> and <HI>Mammalucks</HI>) becau&s;e, according to this Book, <HI>Selim</HI> was to con|quer <HI>Egypt:</HI> which accordingly came to pa&s;s. He &s;hewed us al&s;o a Book, that he &s;aid was a Calculation of the &s;everal Degrees of the
<PB N="200" REF="67">overflowing of the River of <HI>Nilus,</HI> regulated according to the Mo|tion of the Planets, e&s;pecially of the <HI>Moon;</HI> by an <HI>Arabian</HI> Doctor. Another of Chiromancy, more curious than tho&s;e of <HI>John Batti&s;ta Porta:</HI> In which the Author pretends, That the Characters of the Hands are Letters; of which he gives the Alphabet. He al&s;o told us of another, called <HI>Bauraan,</HI> an antient Author, containing abundance of Chimical Experiments; commented on by a Cheke, who was a <HI>Moor,</HI> with whom he was acquainted at Grand <HI>Cairo:</HI> Where he a&s;&s;ured us, there were abundance of very con&s;iderable Per&s;ons, who applyed them|&s;elves to this Study, and mo&s;t other Sciences. At another time, he &s;hewed us the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Tamerlan</HI> in <HI>Arabick,</HI> more ample than that Tran&s;lated out of the <HI>Arabick</HI> of <HI>Alhacen.</HI> Two Books of <HI>Tali&s;man</HI>'s, teaching their Principles and Practice; out of which he affirmeth, That Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gaffarelle</HI> had borrowed all he had written in his Book of <HI>&V;nheard of Curio&s;ities:</HI> That <HI>Hugo Grotius</HI> had &s;tollen all his Prin|cipal Arguments for the <HI>Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> out-of <HI>Ara|bian</HI> Authors; and particularly, from the Works of an Eminent Man, whom the <HI>Latins</HI> hold to be an Arch-Heretick: But the <HI>Cofty</HI>'s, a Saint, who wrote an excellent Book again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> for the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion. And what is more to be wondered at, he a&s;&s;ured us, That he had &s;een an antient Book of A&s;tronomy, which did &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Magnetick Needle;</HI> although he did not apply it to Navigation, but to other A&s;trological u&s;es. He &s;hewed us al&s;o a general Hi&s;tory of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> and a De&s;cription of all the Churches of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> at the time it was taken by the <HI>Turks;</HI> both writ|ten in <HI>Arabick.</HI> La&s;tly, He told us, That both at Grand <HI>Cairo</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> there were publick Profe&s;&s;ors, that taught A&s;trology, A|&s;tronomy, Geometry, Arithmetick, Poetry, the <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lan|guages.</P>
<P>When we were at this Corner of the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CONSTAN|TINE'S PA|LACE.</NOTE> we went to an old Building, they &s;ay was <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Palace; which &s;tands upon the highe&s;t Ground, on that &s;ide of the City; for from the Harbour to it, is an A&s;cent, and thence towards the Seven Towers the Ground a|gain de&s;cends. What remains of it, expre&s;&s;es no Magnificence; being only a long Stone building, with a Hall &s;u&s;tained by Pillars, and &s;ome Rooms over it.</P>
<P>Without the Walls, from hence to the Seven Towers, on the Brow of the Hill, is a good Walk; but the Valley We&s;t-wards of it, being only the burying Place of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> makes it &s;omewhat Melancholly. Among the&s;e, here and there towards the Haven, are &s;ome Monuments of <HI>Turks</HI> of Quality, of white Marble, &s;haded with Plane Trees, and Cypre&s;s Trees.</P>
<P>Here we went to &s;ee that of <HI>Sultan Eliub,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SULTAN ELIUB'S TOMB.</NOTE> near the Harbour, whom they e&s;teem as a Prophet, and great Saint; and therefore, it is frequent|ed by the Zealous <HI>Turks,</HI> with a great deal of Devotion. The Tomb is covered with a kind of Canopy, hung with Green, and many Lamps continually burning about it. Without is a &s;mall Quadrangle, with a Portico and Gallery encompa&s;&s;ing it, and a little Chappel in the middle. Here the Grand Signior is inaugurated, only by the Ceremony of a Sword girt about him by the <HI>Mufti;</HI> &s;ignifying that his Authority con|&s;i&s;teth
<PB N="201" REF="67">in the Power he hath obtained by that, and by that mu&s;t &s;till be maintained. We ob&s;erved near this Angle of the City, where the Water falls into a Ci&s;tern, and thence conveyed into other adjacent Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>There are no Suburbs of Buildings contiguous to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE HARBOUR.</NOTE> the Walls &s;tanding, being bare all round the three &s;ides; but in&s;tead thereof, it hath over the Water great and populous Towns and Cities; which we ob&s;erved with great plea&s;ure in our Return, as they lay all in view round about the Harbour: Whereof the North-&s;ide of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> encompa&s;&s;eth the South, and South-We&s;t Shore. To which <HI>Scutari,</HI> on the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Shore, &s;eems to be joyned Ea&s;t-wards; and to <HI>Scutari</HI> on the <HI>Thracian</HI> Shore, <HI>Tophana, Fondoucli,</HI> and <HI>Gallata:</HI> And to <HI>Gallata,</HI> &s;ome Suburbs appertaining to it, where they kill their Meat; beyond which are Buildings, and dry Harbours, to keep the Gallies from the Weather in the Winter. The&s;e bound the Har|bour on the North-Ea&s;t, North, and North-We&s;t &s;ides. All the&s;e Buildings ri&s;ing by Degrees, higher and higher, from the &s;everal Shores, to the tops of con&s;iderable high and &s;teep Hills, make the Har|bour look like a va&s;t <HI>Naumachia,</HI> giving a mo&s;t Magnificent Spectacle to the Beholders into it. At the further end, which lies North-We&s;t|wards, a &s;mall River of fre&s;h Water emptieth it &s;elf; who&s;e Banks are adorned with &s;everal plea&s;ant Gardens, and &s;hady Trees. But the Beauty is not the only Excellency of this Harbour; for I believe, it al&s;o excells mo&s;t in the World for Security and Capacity. It hath more depth than is needful, good Moorage, and &s;o bold a Shore, that the greate&s;t Ship may be tyed by the Bolt Sprit on Shore, at <HI>Gallata,</HI> and unlade; and yet have &s;everal Fathoms of Water under her Keel. And I have ob&s;erved &s;ome Merchant Ships lying with the &s;ide &s;o near the Shore, that they went on Board, and on Shore, by a Plank be|tween them. Which I was &s;orry to &s;ee, one being a Genue&s;e infect|ed with the Plague, that lay within fifteen or twenty Yards of our Lodging; being a Building on the Harbour, &s;eparated from all others, without the Wall of <HI>Gallata;</HI> which our Landlord had provided us, upon the fir&s;t notice of the Infection &s;eizing on the Hou&s;e adjoyning to his, within the Walls: For it was at <HI>Gallata</HI> we lodged, during our &s;tay at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> at the Hou&s;e of an hone&s;t <HI>Jew</HI> called <HI>Abram Finch,</HI> who &s;erved the Engli&s;h Nation in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and us, both in the nature of Guide, and Drayoman, better than mo&s;t <HI>Turks</HI> could: But when we made Vi&s;its to any of Quality, we took al&s;o a Janizary; and this was, becau&s;e we had no Letters of Recommendation to any other; not thinking of going any further than <HI>Athens,</HI> when we fir&s;t under|took this Voyage from <HI>Venice.</HI> Be&s;ides the Plague being there &s;o hot, we judged it unrea&s;onable to intrude our &s;elves into the Hou&s;es of any of our Country-men, &s;ince our Curio&s;ity led us every where, with|out con&s;ideration of Danger.</P>
<P><HI>Gallata</HI> is &s;ituate upon the South-&s;ide of a con&s;iderable &s;teep Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GALLATA</NOTE> jetting out into a Promontory on the North-&s;ide of the Harbour; and comprehending the Suburbs on the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, and North-&s;ides of it, may be counted a good large City, and very populous. Yet the Circumference of the Walls take up no great &s;pace of Ground; but
<PB N="202" REF="68">the Hou&s;es are thick, and the Streets narrow, and the whole very populous. On the top of the Hill, is a round &s;pired Tower, covered with Lead; and on the Wall we ob&s;erved &s;ome Arms, and modern In&s;criptions, which upon inquiry, we found to belong to tho&s;e of <HI>Ge|noua;</HI> who &s;ometime before the taking of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> were Ma&s;ters of this Place.</P>
<P>This City is peopled more by Chri&s;tians and <HI>Jews,</HI> than it is by <HI>Turks:</HI> And here is the Scale of the Merchants; who have a good Kan, covered with Lead in Cuppaloes; where they expo&s;e their Wool|len Cloaths, they call Londros, and other Merchandize to &s;ale.</P>
<P>On the North-&s;ide of <HI>Gallata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PERA.</NOTE> without the Walls, are the Suburbs, called by the Greeks <HI>Pera;</HI> which &s;ignifies beyond: by which Name they &s;ometimes comprehend <HI>Gallata,</HI> and all the adjacent Habitations, being beyond the Harbour from <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and therefore they call that Pa&s;&s;age <HI>Perami, Trajectus,</HI> or the Pa&s;&s;age; and the Boats that carry them, <HI>Peramidia.</HI> There is one good large Street running North|wards, with &s;everal that cro&s;s it; and there dwell the foreign Am|ba&s;&s;adours, Re&s;idents, and Envoys.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> His Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;adour at the Port, was then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> to have his Audience of the Grand Signior; and did not return hither, until about a Week or ten days before our Depar|ture. But &s;o &s;oon as he did, he gave us frequent Opportunities of wait|ing on him; and obliged us not only with his learned Conver&s;ation, but with many u&s;eful Informations al&s;o.</P>
<P>We often went to vi&s;it the Marque&s;s of <HI>Nantel,</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour of <HI>France;</HI> who with great Courte&s;ie, entertained us with the Curio&s;i|ties of his Travails. He hath there about thirty Marbles, with antient In&s;criptions, and Ba&s;&s;o-relievo's, brought from <HI>Athens,</HI> and the I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> of which he permitted us to copy what we would. He hath al&s;o a great Number of Medals; among which are &s;ome ve|ry &s;ingular. He &s;hewed us abundance of De&s;igns of Edifices, Ba&s;&s;o|relievo's, and Pro&s;pects of Countries, drawn by a Painter he &s;till car|ried with him in his Travels in <HI>Turkey.</HI> All which, I hope, he will publi&s;h at his Return into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Covel,</HI> then Chaplain to His Maje&s;ty's Amba&s;&s;adour there, among many Curio&s;ities, &s;hewed us &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Songs, &s;et to Mu&s;ick; which he told us, were both for Sen&s;e and Mu&s;ick, very good; but pa&s;t our Under&s;tanding. They were &s;et by one <HI>Hulisbey,</HI> a Renegado, brought up in the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> His Native Country was <HI>Poland,</HI> and Chri&s;tian Name <HI>Albertus Bobovius.</HI> He was made a Slave when young; and now, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> is become a principal Drugger-man, and can &s;peak (they &s;ay) &s;eventeen Languages. If I remember right, Dr. <HI>Covel</HI> told me, It was the &s;ame, that gave Con&s;ul <HI>Ricaut</HI> much light in his Treati&s;e of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire. The Marque&s;s of <HI>Nanteul</HI> hath a De&s;cription of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> written by him in <HI>Italian,</HI> with many other curious things. Dr. <HI>Covel</HI> al&s;o &s;hewed me many rare Medals, and antient Entaglos or Figures, cut on &s;everal &s;orts of precious Stones; as al&s;o, many De&s;criptions of rare Plants and Animals; which he had curiou&s;ly de&s;igned him&s;elf, being in that Art very ingenious, as well as a learned Divine.</P>

<P>We went &s;ometimes to &s;ee an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Surgeon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">OPIUM.</NOTE> called <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;ha</HI> in the place <HI>Atmeydam;</HI> who informed us, That he was taken young, and made a Slave, and brought up in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religi|on.

Then wa&s;hing the place with hot Water, and rubbing it with a cour&s;e Cloth, bringeth all the Hair off without doing the lea&s;t Hurt. We bought &s;ome of it at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where it is very cheap.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is a place that aboundeth with all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, whether Corn, Fle&s;h, or Fi&s;h; only Wine is &s;carce, by rea&s;on that it is prohibited. But though there be none permitted to be &s;old in the City, at <HI>Gallata</HI> are &s;ome Chri&s;tian Cabarets; but the Wine is dear. They &s;ell it by weight here, and all over <HI>Turkey.</HI> The <HI>Oka,</HI> which is a weight of about forty two Ounces, is &s;old here for a quarter of a Doller, that is about fourteen Pence, and contains about three Pints and an half, or two Quarts. The be&s;t Wine is made by the <HI>Jews,</HI> who by their Law mu&s;t not make Mixtures. They have great plenty of ma|ny &s;orts of good Fi&s;h. Oy&s;ters here are better than I ta&s;ted them any where, except in <HI>England.</HI> The Sword-Fi&s;h is another I took notice of for its Goodne&s;s, and firm fle&s;hy Sub&s;tance. Their Fruits are ex|cellent; Figs, Peaches, and Apples, very fair and good. The <HI>Turks</HI> are very &s;weet-tooth'd, and love all kind of &s;weet Meats: But I cannot commend them for good Confectioners. They pre&s;erve Fruits with new Wine boyled to Syrup, Honey, and &s;ometimes Sugar; which although they are not ill-ta&s;ted, would hardly pa&s;s with our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="69">Ladies, they are &s;o ill-colour'd. Their mo&s;t ordinary Drink is Wa|ter; next, a Sorbet made of Rai&s;ins &s;teeped in Water. But the Richer &s;ort have Sorbet made of Sugar and Honey boyled to a con&s;i&s;tence with the Juyce of lemons; which they mix with Water, when they u&s;e it. <HI>Coffee</HI> they drink at any time, but at Meal; and is the u&s;ual En|tertainment, when any come to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>About a dozen or fifteen Miles North from <HI>Gallata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BELGRADE.</NOTE> towards the Black Sea, we went to &s;ee a place, which from the Beauty and Plea|&s;antne&s;s of it, is called <HI>Belgrade.</HI> The Country lies high, &s;haded with abundance of Woods, watered with many whol&s;om Springs, &s;tored with &s;everal &s;orts of Game, accommodated with &s;everal &s;mall Villages, at convenient Di&s;tances, and the Air very good and healthful. To the&s;e &s;hady Woods, many Per&s;ons of Quality, as well of the <HI>Turks</HI> as Amba&s;&s;adours, and rich Merchants; retire to enjoy the fre&s;h Air in the &s;corching Heats of Summer, and to hunt at the proper Sea&s;ons of the Year.</P>
<P>Here &s;ome build them pretty Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, others &s;tately Chio&s;ques, or Banquetting-Hou&s;es; and others content them&s;elves to &s;ojourn in Tents, they &s;tretch out under the tall Trees, near &s;ome refre&s;hing Spring. All the&s;e Springs are with great Care, and greater Charges, collected into &s;everal large Ci&s;terns; near each of which is built a &s;tately Chio&s;que, or Summer-hou&s;e. The u&s;ual Form of them is &s;quare, contrived &s;o with large Pent-hou&s;e-Roofs for &s;hade; yet &s;o open round about, that one enjoys all the Liverty, Fre&s;hne&s;s, and Goodne&s;s of the open Air, without the lea&s;t Inconvenience from the heat of the Sun. You mount up to them by four or five Steps, to an Area paved with Purcelane Tile or Marble, covered with <HI>Indian</HI> Mats or Carpets, with Balu&s;ters or Rails about it. The Roof al&s;o within, is painted with &s;everal Colours, as red, green, white, and yellow; and pretty Knots of Figures wrought on them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Ci&s;terns, the Water is conveyed by Channels under ground, to the &s;everal Aqueducts, that carry it by many Windings and Turnings over the low Valleys, from the tops of Hills to Hills; until at la&s;t it is brought with a va&s;t Charge to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Se|veral of the&s;e we ob&s;erved, both in our way thither, and return to <HI>Gallata:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">AUQEDUCTS</NOTE> E&s;pecially, one about mid-way, joyning two Hills together cro&s;s a Valley, at lea&s;t half a Mile over. This con&s;i&s;ts of two Ranges of Arches; whereof the lowermo&s;t hath fifty, and the uppermo&s;t fif|ty one; and I believe, from the deepe&s;t part of the Valley, to the top of the Aqueduct, is above thirty Yards. There is another in &s;ight of this Ea&s;twards, which bends and makes an Angle: This hath three Ranges of Arches one above the other, but not &s;o many in number. North of this fir&s;t, we &s;aw another, which joyns two Hills together by a narrow, but very deep Valley. This hath but four Arches in two Tanges, but the Arches are exceedign large; I mea&s;ured them not: but Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> &s;aith, They are above fifty Foot wide. The Care of the&s;e Waters, and the clean&s;ing of the&s;e Aqueducts, and Channels, are impo&s;ed upon the adjacent Villages; for which &s;ervice, they are freed from all other Taxes. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Aqueducts were built by the latter <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours: But by Time, Wars, and Neg|lignece,
<PB N="205" REF="69" MS="y">being run to decay and ruined, they were repaired again at the great Charge, and indefatigable Indu&s;try of <HI>Sultan Suliman;</HI> who for this, and the &s;tately Mo&s;que he built in the City, was de&s;ervedly called the Magnificent. The&s;e Waters being thus brought to the City, are again collected into &s;everal great Ci&s;terns; and thence again, by earthen Pipes, di&s;per&s;ed to the &s;everal Quarters, private Hou&s;es, and publick Buildings of the City: Whereof one is again&s;t the wall of the City by <HI>Ballata,</HI> another under <HI>Hagia-Sophia;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> &s;peaks of one at <HI>Sultan Selim</HI>'s Mo&s;que.</P>
<P>The Plants I took notice of hereabouts, were 1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> A kind of <HI>Dwarf-Abrotonum,</HI> with Flowers like <HI>Cammonil.</HI> 2. A &s;ort of <HI>Serpillum,</HI> with Leaves like <HI>Savoury;</HI> the Smell al&s;o differing from ours.</P>

<P>I found another Plant going thither, and to the Black-Sea al&s;o; which I know not to what <HI>&s;pecies</HI> to refer, unle&s;s to <HI>Andro&s;emum majus</HI> which we call <HI>Parks-Leaves:</HI> For the Leaves are of the &s;ub&s;tance and colour, only longer, and of a more tough Sub&s;tance, growing two by two, on a &s;hrubby &s;quare Stalk, of a reddi&s;h colour, not ri&s;ing from the ground above a &s;pan high: On the top of which &s;ucceedeth a large yellow Flower, much bigger than <HI>Parks-Leaves,</HI> filled with a large Tuft of the &s;ame; our of which, before the Flower is fallen, beginneth to ri&s;e a long Ve&s;&s;el, divided into five Appartments full of reddi&s;h Seeds. The Smell is like the be&s;t <HI>Turpentine;</HI> but more fra|grant, and like <HI>Coris.</HI> Of it I ob&s;erved two &s;orts: The difference is only, that the other by pairs cro&s;s each other. It &s;preads upon the Ground in heaps; &s;o that &s;eldom one &s;hall find one Stalk a|lone.</P>
<PB N="206" REF="70">
<P>Since my writing this, I find that Dr. <HI>Mori&s;on</HI> hath de&s;cribed this Plant in his excellent Hi&s;tory of Plants, having rai&s;ed it in the Bo|tanick Garden at <HI>Oxford,</HI> of which Science he is the Learned Pro|fe&s;&s;our, out of the Seeds I &s;ent to that Univer&s;ity; and hath named it, <HI>Andro&s;emum Olympii montis flore &amp; &s;emine Theca quinque cap&s;ulari ominum maximus:</HI> which is extreamly well di&s;tingui&s;hed; only he &s;hould have put in <HI>Byzantinum</HI> or <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitanum,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Montis Olympii;</HI> as he hath done lately in a Letter to me, with the De&s;ign of the Plant I here give you.</P>
<P>I al&s;o there &s;aw &s;ome Trees of <HI>Guaiacum Patavinum;</HI> which were &s;hewed us as a Rarity at <HI>Pera.</HI></P>
<P>We waited a good while for a calm Day, to go to the Mouth of the Black Sea, to &s;ee the Pillar vulgarly called <HI>Pompey</HI>'s <HI>Pillar:</HI> For the North-wind reigns much in that Sea; and when it bloweth, there is no pa&s;&s;ing a|gain&s;t it, and the Stream. We took a good &s;trong Boat, with &s;ix Oars; and left on each hand, as we were turning the point of <HI>Gallata,</HI> many Villages, who&s;e Situations are very plea&s;ant, with Rocks, Hills, and Promontories, covered with Che&s;nuts, Olives, and Cypre&s;s Trees; be|&s;ides many of the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s, and other great Mens <HI>Seraglio</HI>'s, or <HI>Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure.</HI> I never &s;aw more beautiful, nor greater Variety of Pro|&s;pects; where the Motion of the Boat each moment changeth the Scene. On the <HI>Thracian</HI> Shore, from <HI>gallata,</HI> are the&s;e: viz. <HI>Topha|na, Fondukli, Bechikroa&s;h, ORtaqui, Corout, Sche&s;me, Arnaudqui, Bubel|bakchi&s;i, Eski-hi&s;&s;ar</HI> or <HI>Old Ca&s;tle, Bartoliman, Stegna, Jegniqui, Thera|nia, Boindore, Sariier, Fanari:</HI> where is a Light-Hou&s;e ju&s;t within the Mouth of the Sea, on the right hand; and on the Shore of <HI>Natolia,</HI> beginning from <HI>Scutari,</HI> are <HI>Cou&s;ch-couiouk, Stauros, Chenguetqui, Con|la bakchi&s;i, Candel-bakche&s;i, Eski-hi&s;&s;ar,</HI> or <HI>Old Castle</HI> of <HI>Natolia:</HI> both which defend the&s;e Streights from Incur&s;ions from the <HI>Euxin,</HI> or <HI>Black\Sea, Guio&s;qui, Chiboucli, Inguirliqui, Oncliar, Skelo&s;i, Beicos, Salicevroun, Joro,</HI> in old time <HI>Fanum;</HI> becau&s;e probably it was a Light-Hou&s;e in tho&s;e times. a little without the Entrance, on the left hand, is the Rock whereon &s;tandeth the Pillar. It is of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, up|on a <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> and both of white Marble; upon which is an In&s;cription, that &s;heweth it to have been dedicated to <HI>Augustus.</HI> But it is imper|fect, and &s;o worn with &s;tanding bleak to the Winds, that to make any more of it, is pa&s;t the Skill of the Antiquaries; &s;ome calling the la&s;t word <HI>PONTO,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>FRONTO.</HI> The other Lines are imperfect likewi&s;e: For at the beginning is a part of a Letter, that may be taken for either a <HI>C,</HI> or an <HI>O.</HI> If the fir&s;t, it mu&s;t be <HI>C. CAESARI AVGVSTO.</HI> But otherwi&s;e only, the end of a word, as by the <HI>E</HI> in the next line, &s;eemeth very probable: And Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> maketh it it to be <HI>DIVO,</HI> as probably it was: So that the fir&s;t line may be <HI>DIVO CAESARI AVGVSTO.</HI></P>
<P>As to the next Line, I would conclude with Mr. <HI>Sands,</HI> That it is <HI>L. CLANNIDIVS,</HI> If I could have found any &s;uch Name among the <HI>Roman</HI> Families: But I find only <HI>Annidius,</HI> And be&s;ides my own, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation, make the fir&s;t letter an <HI>E;</HI> and mu&s;t therefore be the la&s;t letter in a word; as in many In&s;criptions I have &s;een <HI>E</HI> written for <HI>ET,</HI> and then I would put a
<PB N="207" REF="70">point between <HI>C L.</HI> and <HI>Annidius;</HI> and then it would be for <HI>&amp; Clan|dius Annidius:</HI> For <HI>C L.</HI> is put for <HI>Clandius,</HI> and not <HI>CLA&V;.</HI> except there is a Praenomen before it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t line is as much travers't as any. The fir&s;t two letters that Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> makes <HI>L E.</HI> are undoubtedly <HI>L. F. Luci Filius;</HI> as it is in Mr. <HI>Sands,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI>'s, and my own Ob&s;ervation took upon the Place. As to the re&s;t, there is room enough for every one to have his Fancy. mr. <HI>Sands</HI> makes it <HI>CLAPONTO,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> interpreteth <HI>CLAS|SIS I PONTO;</HI> and &s;o maketh it the Payment of a Vow of &s;ome, that had &s;afely conducted their Navy through this dangerous Sea. Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> makes it <HI>CLA. FRONTO.</HI></P>
<P>But what it can &s;o &s;ignify, I cannot tell. It is true, <HI>RONTO</HI> is plainly to be read; but the next Letter is very much defaced; but I fan&s;ied it to be another <HI>R,</HI> whcih I marked down in my Book with points: the fir&s;t long &s;troke is entire, and plain; but for the re&s;t of it, one hath much adoe to make &s;ome worn-out Marks hang together. As to the <HI>A,</HI> the <HI>L,</HI> and the <HI>C, ordine retrogrado</HI> following, they are plainly to be read. So that, if I were to be its Re&s;titutor, I would write it
<Q><P>&mdash; DIVO CAESARI AVGVSTO
<LB>&mdash; E CL. ANNIDIUS
<LB>&mdash; L. F. CL. ARRONTO</P></Q></P>
<P>I find the Family <HI>Arruntius</HI> in <HI>Gruterus,</HI> in many In&s;criptions; and <HI>O</HI> for <HI>V</HI> might be an ea&s;ie mi&s;take of the Graver, in &s;o remote a Country, if not of the Per&s;on him&s;elf: And we know, that Let|ters were not every ones Talent in tho&s;e days. And to conclude, I believe the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> upon which this In&s;cription is, was not made for that Pillar, becau&s;e they bear no proportion one with another. It has been, in my opinion, a round Altar, being carved about with Wreaths of abundance, &s;u&s;tained by Bull's-heads. The white Pillar (which I judge about ten foot high above it) might have been erected upon it, to &s;erve for a Sea-mark by day, as the Lanthorn at <HI>Fanari</HI> doth by night: Indeed, I &s;hould think it any thing, rather than a Pillar erected to <HI>Pompey.</HI> The Rock on whch it &s;tands, is one of the <HI>Cyaneae,</HI> or <HI>Symplegades</HI> of the Antients; fan&s;ied to float, becau&s;e &s;ometimes &s;een together, as they thought, &s;eeing them from &s;everal Stations. But &s;ome of them are placed on the one &s;ide of the Entrance of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> and &s;ome on the other. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> counted four on the <HI>European</HI> &s;ide: But the North-wind beginning to ri&s;e, we were for|ced to ruturn &s;oon after the viewing of the Pillar.</P>
<P>In our return, about &s;ix Miles from the Pillar, we &s;topped to &s;ee a <HI>Greek</HI> Church, upon the highe&s;t of the Hills on the <HI>Thracian</HI> Shore, called <HI>Mavronides.</HI> It is a place of very great Devotion among the <HI>Greekes,</HI> and payeth no Taxes to the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> only a few Cher|ries for his own eating. The rea&s;on of which they told us was this: The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> being a hunting at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and eagerly pur&s;uing his Game this way, lo&s;t his Attendants, and came to this place; where being weary, hot, and dry, he alighted to repo&s;e and refre&s;h him&s;elf;
<PB N="208" REF="71">and demanding Water of the poor <HI>Caloyers,</HI> who knew him, one of them readily brought him &s;ome Bread and Water, and fre&s;h-gathered Cherries, which are there excellent good: at which he &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed, and told him, That if he would change his Religion, he would promote him to great Honour. But the poor, yet faithful Chri&s;tian, re&s;olving not to part with his Faith, would he have given him his Empire; and knowing he could give that proud Tyrant no An&s;wer that would plea&s;e him, and &s;ecure his Con&s;cience void of of|fence, on that Subject, made no An&s;wer at all; but fixed his Eyes up|on the ground, notwith&s;tanding all he could &s;ay to him. At which he greatly wondering, and admiring his Con&s;tancy, told him, That for this Service, that Place &s;hould pay no <HI>Caratch,</HI> only &s;ome Cherries yearly to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> for his own eating.</P>
<P>A little before we arrived at <HI>Gallata,</HI> I took notice of a dangerous Rock in the Chanel, lying piked above Water not more than four or five Foot; which mu&s;t needs be very dangerous for tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, that pa&s;s that way by night.</P>
<P>One day we cro&s;s'd over the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Scutari,</HI> and in the Pa&s;&s;age put a &s;hore on the <HI>Maiden Tower</HI> as they call a little Sconce, fortified with a few pieces of great Guns, built upon a Rock about the middle of the Chanel, but rather nearer the Shore of <HI>Natolia.</HI> All that it is remarkable for, is, That although it be but a Rock, not much above thirty Yards about, encompa&s;&s;ed by the Sea at lea&s;t half a Mile from any Shore, very deep, yet it hath a Fountain of fre&s;h Water; which, as they a&s;&s;ured us, ari&s;eth out of the Rock, and was no Ci&s;tern. I took notice, that the Current of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> runs very &s;wift on each &s;ide of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SCUTARI.</NOTE> From thence <HI>Scutari</HI> is the neare&s;t Shore; and is &s;ituate oppo&s;ite to the Haven, between the two Promontories, of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> and <HI>Gallata.</HI> It is now a large City, and is beautified with a Royal Mo&s;que, built, and endowed by the <HI>Sultane&s;s-Mother.</HI> It &s;eem|eth to be in the &s;ame place, that <HI>Strabo</HI> puts <HI>Chry&s;opolis;</HI> but we ob|&s;erved nothing of Antiquity there. We went through the Town, up to the top of the Hill South-ward, and pa&s;&s;ed through a very large Burying-place of the <HI>Turks,</HI> containing, I believe, above ten or a dozen Acres; which is ordinary in <HI>Turkey,</HI> becau&s;e they bury not in the place where another hath been buried. They therefore &s;et a Stone upright, one at the Head, and another at the Feet of each Body.</P>
<P>Proceeding a little further on the Brow of the Hill, we had a good Pro&s;pect towards <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Gallata,</HI> the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and the <HI>Bo&s;phorus:</HI> And here the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> hath a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, cal|led as they do others, <HI>Serai,</HI> or as the Francks form it, <HI>Seraglio.</HI> They told us, That it was built after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> made by the Father, to this <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></P>
<P>Hard by this we took Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHALCEDON</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ed a little reach, about a a Mile and half, to <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> now but a blind Town; as its Foun|ders, for their ill Choice, were e&s;teemed by the Oracle. It is more antient than <HI>Byzantium;</HI> but now famous for nothing, but the Me|mory of the Great Council held there, in the Year of our Lord 327. and 20^t^h of the Reign of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great. The fir&s;t thing we did, was to vi&s;it the Metropolitan Church, where they &s;ay it was kept.
<PB N="209" REF="71">But Mon&s;ieur <HI>Nanteul</HI> a&s;&s;ured us, That it was a Mile from thence; and that he had there read an In&s;cription, that mentioneth it. Be&s;ide, that it is but a &s;mall, ob&s;cure Building, uncapable to contain &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly. The <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Cadiqui;</HI> but the <HI>Greeks</HI> yet <HI>Chalcedona.</HI> Here we found &s;ome antient Sepulchral Monuments, and upon one an In&s;cription. We found another In&s;cription in the Wall of a private Hou&s;e, near the Church; which &s;ignifieth, That <HI>Evante,</HI> Son of <HI>Anti|pater,</HI> having made a pro&s;perous Voyage towards the <HI>Abrotanians,</HI> and the I&s;lands <HI>Cyaneae,</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Euxin</HI> Sea, as I before noted; and hence de&s;iring to return by the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, and <HI>Pontus,</HI> offered Cakes at this Statue, which he had erected to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who had &s;ent him &s;uch good Weather, as a Token of his good Voyage.</P>

<P>WHEN we had &s;atisfied our Curio&s;ity with <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> and the Places adjacent, we began to con|&s;ider how we might now return to vi&s;it <HI>Athens,</HI> as we de&s;ign'd: But we found all the ways we had propo&s;ed to our &s;elves, &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed with great Difficulties, and evident Dangers, that it was no ea&s;ie matter for us to determin which of them to take. Our fir&s;t Determination was, to go from hence to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> to &s;ee the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Court; &s;o to Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> now called <HI>Monte Santo,</HI> which I had a particular de&s;ire to &s;ee; and thence, through <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Boeotia,</HI> to <HI>Athens.</HI> But my Lord Amba&s;&s;adour, who was then newly return'd from <HI>A|drianople,</HI> di&s;&s;waded us from that; a&s;&s;uring us, That without a Miracle, it was not po&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape the Plague; all <HI>Thrace</HI> being &s;o through|ly
<PB N="212" REF="73">infected with it, that although he him&s;elf lay in no Hou&s;e or <HI>Kan,</HI> in his Journey thence, yet had lo&s;t one of his Servants by the way; and was forced, &s;oon after his Arrival hither, to quit his hou&s;e, be|cau&s;e another fell &s;ick of it: So that, we thought it would be pre|&s;umption in us, to adventure our &s;elves that way, and no le&s;s madne&s;s to hazard our &s;elves at Sea, now Winter was coming on, in &s;uch &s;mall Barques; as we mu&s;t have done, if as we had de&s;ign'd, we had gone but to Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> to &s;ee how tho&s;e Hermites &s;pend their time there. But whil'&s;t we were in the&s;e doubts, it happened, that &s;ome of our Engli&s;h Merchants, that came from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to wait on the Amba&s;&s;adour at his Audience, were ready to return again thither. So that we &s;uddenly re&s;olved to take the Opportunity of their Compa|ny, and &s;ee tho&s;e Parts of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> not doubting, but from thence we might meet with an Opportunity according to our de&s;ire, to pa&s;s in|to <HI>Greece.</HI> And &s;o in the good Company of Doctor <HI>Pickering,</HI> Phy|&s;ician to the Factory at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> Dr. <HI>Covel,</HI> who was &s;o kind as to bring us &s;ome part of the way, and divers Merchants; we made a common Pur&s;e, taking a Barque among us, and parted hence about Noon, <HI>October</HI> the Sixth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Village we pa&s;&s;ed by after <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> was <HI>Phanari,</HI> ju&s;t without the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Promontory of the <HI>Propontis,</HI> as the other is of the <HI>Euxin</HI> Sea; and hath a Rock lying before it, on which is placed a Pede&s;tal of a Pillar, like that of <HI>Pompey</HI>'s Pillar: which &s;hews them both to have been &s;et there only for a Sea-Mark. A little further, without the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> &s;teering South-Ea&s;t-wards, we left at the right hand the I&s;land <HI>Prote;</HI> where the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ships, we came in, lay, not daring to venture into the Harbour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> by rea&s;on of the Plague. A little further we left another little I&s;land, called <HI>Antigoni;</HI> and not far thence another, e&s;teemed about eighteen Miles from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHALCIS In&s;.</NOTE> called <HI>Chalcis,</HI> where we lodged that Night. Dr. <HI>Covel,</HI> and I, as &s;oon as we &s;et footing on the I&s;land, went on the top of the highe&s;t Hill, to view the others round about it, and to &s;ee if we could find any marks of the Gold Mines they pretend to be there; but in&s;tead of them, found only Rocks cover'd with <HI>Stoecas Arabica, Myrtles, Arbutus,</HI> and <HI>Ci&s;tus Foemina, Leidon.</HI> The I&s;lands that are about it, are the&s;e, <HI>Prote</HI> and <HI>Antigoni</HI> North, <HI>Oxya</HI> and <HI>Plate</HI> North-We&s;t, called &s;o by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> becau&s;e the one is <HI>pointed,</HI> the other <HI>low</HI> and <HI>plain.</HI> South of it, are two other little I&s;lands; the one called <HI>Principe,</HI> which is the bigge&s;t; and another little one by it, called <HI>Epiti,</HI> in times pa&s;t <HI>Pitys.</HI> The&s;e I&s;lands lie at the Mouth of a Bay, called formerly <HI>A&s;tacenus Sinus,</HI> now <HI>I&s;hmit,</HI> from a Town, at the bottom of it, bearing now the &s;ame name, but was called antiently <HI>Nicomedia.</HI> There is a Village, and two Convents in <HI>Chalcis.</HI> At that on the We&s;tern-&s;ide of the I&s;land we lay, and were well treated by the <HI>Caloyers.</HI> This Convent being ruined, was rebuilt by one <HI>Pana|giotes,</HI> not long &s;ince <HI>Druggerman</HI> to the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> and &s;o much in his favour, that he obtained many Kindne&s;&s;es for his Fellow-Chri|&s;tians of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church; as the repairing &s;everal of their Churches and Mona&s;teries, e&s;pecially the keeping of the Holy Sepulcher at <HI>Hie|ru&s;alem.</HI> But this he kept &s;ecret until he came to die, becau&s;e, as &s;ome
<PB N="213" REF="73">think, he feared the ill Practices of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; who have two Convents at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> one of <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and another of <HI>Fran|ci&s;cans,</HI> lying at lurch to di&s;able that Church, and would never have patiently &s;uffered &s;o great a lo&s;s. He lieth buried here, and hath a Mo|nument with an Epitaph, expre&s;&s;ing his Office.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o the Tomb of Sir <HI>Edward Barton,</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour to this Court in Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> days.</P>
<P>The next Morning early we parted thence, and leaving the I&s;lands <HI>Epite</HI> and <HI>Principe</HI> on the left hand, we arrived at the other Promon|tory of the Gulf of <HI>I&s;hmit;</HI> which by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> &s;eemeth to have been called <HI>Po&s;idium Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>Parting thence after Dinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CIANUS SI|NUS. BESBICUS OR ISOLA DEL PAPA.

Thence, rowing along the Shore, a Mile fur|ther Ea&s;t-wards, we pa&s;&s;ed by a large Village, called not <HI>Sequino,</HI> as our Map-makers have it, but <HI>Syky,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SYKY.</NOTE> from the abundance of wild Fig|trees that grow there, as the word imports. There is a Church they call <HI>Hagios Strategos,</HI> which is the Name they ordinarily give S^t <HI>Mi|chael</HI> the Arch-Angel; which is to &s;ay, the <HI>Holy Captain.</HI> By it, on the Shore, is a Fountain they call <HI>Chri&s;tos;</HI> the Water of which, they &s;ay, worketh Miracles; and therefore they name it <HI>Hagia&s;ma,</HI> or <HI>Holy Water.</HI> We rowed about four or five Miles further, and ar|rived in the Evening at <HI>Mountania.</HI> This is a large Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNTA|NIA.</NOTE> and hath a very good <HI>Kan,</HI> two Stories high, &s;eparated into little Rooms for better Accommodation. Here we lodged, and were invited to drink Coffee by a <HI>Franck Renegado,</HI> who &s;hewed us a mo&s;t ob&s;cene Pup|pet-Show, in which he told us, He plea&s;ed him&s;elf at idle times, as an innocent Diver&s;ion: For he pretended to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick. This hath been an antient and large City, by the Fragments of Antiquity eve|ry where to be &s;een: But what its Name was formerly I know not, unle&s;s <HI>Cium,</HI> that gave the Gulph this Name; which was after cal|led <HI>Pru&s;ia,</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign">] from <HI>Pru&s;ias,</HI> Son of <HI>Per&s;eus,</HI> who&s;e Father <HI>Phi|lip</HI> had de&s;troyed it.

<P>Hence in the Morning, having hired Hor&s;es at four Timins apiece, we proceeded to <HI>Pru&s;ia,</HI> or as &s;ome pronounce it, <HI>Bur&s;ia.</HI> Ju&s;t out of <HI>Mountania,</HI> we a&s;cended up a Hill; which, if this Town were for|merly <HI>Cium,</HI> mu&s;t have been called <HI>Argenthonius;</HI> where they cele|brated the Games of <HI>Hyla,</HI> in Honour of <HI>Hylas, Hercules</HI> his Compa|nion, in his Voyage from <HI>Argos</HI> to <HI>Colchus.</HI> Hence we rode about four hours through a fruitful <HI>Plain,</HI> tilled by &s;ome poor Villages &s;cat|tered here and there, who&s;e Inhabitants owe more Caratch than they are worth; one whereof we pa&s;&s;ed through about half way, called <HI>Me|&s;anpoula,</HI> and came by Noon to <HI>Prou&s;a, ad Olympum My&s;iae:</HI> For it is &s;ituated at the Foot of this Mount <HI>Olympus</HI> of <HI>My&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MED. 23.</NOTE> upon a &s;mall Hill a little &s;eparated from it. Here <HI>Ajax</HI> killed him&s;elf, when he fled from <HI>Troy:</HI> and therefore they expre&s;&s;ed it in their Money; of which I have a piece, bearing on the one &s;ide the Head of the Emperour <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and on the other a Figure falling upon his Sword, at the Foot of a Mountain, with the&s;e Letters about it,
&Pgr;&Rgr;&Ogr;&Ugr;&Slungr;&Agr;&Egr;&OHgr;&Ngr;,
of the <HI>Prou&s;ians.</HI> This City hath one of the plea|&s;ante&s;t Comings to it imaginable; the Country on this &s;ide of it, be|ing a large Plain near the City, &s;haded with Mulberry, Walnut, and Che&s;nut-Trees, planted with Gardens on each &s;ide of the high way; which is plain, and with an ea&s;ie A&s;cent bringeth you to the City. Beyond it, the Mountain ri&s;eth to a va&s;t height, made green with Che&s;nut and Firr-Trees, almo&s;t to the top, which is &s;till cover'd with Snow. This is a City, fair, large, and populous in <HI>Turks, Jews, Arme|nians,</HI> and <HI>Greeks;</HI> and was the Chief of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, before <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was taken from the Emperour <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> the Eighth of
<PB N="215" REF="74">that Name, and la&s;t <HI>Greek</HI> Emperour. But <HI>Pru&s;ia</HI> parted with its Chri|&s;tian Liberty to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tyranny with more difficulty, having, be|fore it was rendred, above a Hundred thou&s;and Chri&s;tians &s;lain by tho&s;e Infidels, and abundance more in cold Blood afterwards. For which rea&s;on they pay al&s;o double the Caratch, that any other Place doth; and are not &s;uffer'd to inhabit within the Walls, but only in the Sub|urbs; which neverthele&s;s they bear with Patience, e&s;teeming it a Mark of their Courage. The Place is e&s;teem'd to contain now about For|ty thou&s;and <HI>Turks,</HI> Twelve thou&s;and <HI>Jews;</HI> but not &s;o many <HI>Greeks,</HI> nor <HI>Armenians.</HI> But <HI>Philadar,</HI> a Town four or five Miles from <HI>Pru|&s;ia,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of only Chri&s;tians. The Conquerour, <HI>Orchanes,</HI> did not think fit to di&s;mantle the Town, becau&s;e he made it his principal Re|&s;idence; &s;o that the Walls are yet &s;tanding, which &s;eem to have been built by the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours, out of the Ruins of &s;ome former City, as the Marble-Architraves, broken Pillars and Corni&s;hes, mixed with the other Matter that compo&s;eth them, do te&s;tifie. Some In&s;criptions al&s;o we &s;aw, and copied, as we walked the Rounds of them; which they e&s;teem about &s;ix Miles.</P>
<P>Not quite in the middle, but rather more to the South-Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, is a high Rock, which was the Ca&s;tle, and is naturally &s;trong; but its old Walls, wherewith it was fortified in Times pa&s;t, are much ruined. It was worth our pains to go up to it, becau&s;e thence we had the Pro&s;pect of the whole Town, and told above thir|ty Mo&s;ques by the Minorets. The Sultans have built &s;ix or &s;even Royal Mo&s;ques here; whereof that of <HI>Adalin</HI> is mo&s;t beautiful. The Form &s;quare; and my Companion &s;aith, he told Twenty five Cuppa|loes of equal bigne&s;s, covered with Lead for its Roof.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;tle are two <HI>Soraglio's,</HI> one old, and the other new. The old is almo&s;t demoli&s;hed, and only &s;erves to clean&s;e Corn, and to make fine Flour for the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> The other was built in two Months time, about &s;eventeen Years ago, for the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s coming thither. It is but a &s;mall Building; but well contrived with Baths and Stoves, and adorned with Roofs and Walls gilded and painted in pretty Knots and Flowers; with Pre&s;&s;es on one &s;ide of each Room for Bedding and Furniture, according to the manner of the <HI>Turks;</HI> who have not their Hou&s;es incumbred with great Bed-&s;teads, Tables, Chairs, and Stools: but only a part of the Room rai&s;ed higher than the re&s;t, and covered with a Carpet; where all get up, and &s;it cro&s;s-legg'd, &s;ometimes with Cu&s;hions to &s;it or lean upon; and this &s;erves for Parlour, Dining-Room, and Bed-Chamber. When they &s;it to eat, one bringeth a little round Table, &s;ometimes of one piece of Wood, and &s;ometimes doubled together, with a low Foot; whereon the Meat is &s;et in little Di&s;hes. One Napkin is long enough for the whole Company, and goeth round the Table; which is &s;eldom cover'd with a Cloth, becau&s;e it &s;erveth in&s;tead of Trenchers. When they go to bed, a Servant cometh, and taketh the Quilts, Sheets, and Coverings, and prepareth for as many as lie there, each one one. It would make but a poor Palace for a|ny of our Chri&s;tian Princes. But the Pro&s;pect from the Ca&s;tle is more plea&s;ant, being &s;ituate upon the Brow of the Hill, overlooking the Town and Country: which was no more than nece&s;&s;ary; for it hath
<PB N="216" REF="75">no other Garden now. We expected a better Shew for our <HI>Doller</HI> a Head; which the Keeper exacted of us. But it is good to be un|deceived of the high Opinions we have of Things, which de&s;erve them not; e&s;pecially when our <HI>Experience</HI> co&s;ts not too dear.</P>
<P>There is no con&s;iderable River near this Town. But the Moun|tain doth furni&s;h them with &s;o many Springs, that I never &s;aw more Fountains, nor with greater Sources of Water in any place where-ever I have been: but they are not e&s;teemed very whol&s;ome; I believe, becau&s;e the Snow-Water continually melting from the Mountain, mixeth with them. The&s;e, with what falls from the Mountain, make two little Streams; one whereof we pa&s;&s;ed, coming into the Town; and the other I pa&s;&s;ed over by a Bridge, on the North-Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, to go up the Mountain; which hath another Bridge, not far from this: both well-built and large, joyning the Suburbs to the Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Metropolitan</HI> Church is well worth &s;eeing, having been a fair Build|ing, ca&s;ed within with curious, and well-wrought Marble, built in the form of a <HI>Greek</HI> Cro&s;s that is &s;quare, with a Cuppalo in the Middle, held up by four Pillars; which being beat down in the time of the Siege, was repaired by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and the fair Capitals of the Pillars &s;et, where the Ba&s;is &s;hould be; and the Ba&s;is, where the Capitals: An Emblem of their Tyranny over Chri&s;tendom, turning all things up&s;ide down. So have they made this Holy Place the Sepulcher of <HI>Orchanes,</HI> the Conquerour of it, and the Second King of the <HI>Turks.</HI> But there yet remains the Place of the Altar, which they call <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the <HI>Holy A&s;cent;</HI> being according to their Cu&s;tom, a place containing three Seats one above another, in form of a Semi-circle: On the fir&s;t the Patriarch and Metropolitans u&s;e to &s;it, on the next the Bi&s;hops, and on the other the Presbyters, when the Sacrament was celebrated. Adjoyning to this, is the Sepulcher of <HI>Bajazet</HI>'s Chil|dren.</P>
<P>Beyond the Stream, on the North-Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, is a Roy|al Mo&s;que, and a Colledge by it, with twelve Apartments for twelve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ers; who are obliged to teach to Write, Read, and the Under|&s;tanding of the Law. Thither any poor Man may come, and eat at any time; and on <HI>Fridays,</HI> be fea&s;ted with Rice. Hard by is the Founder's Sepulcher, which looketh very prettily; being a large Cup|palo, covered with Lead on the top, and the Walls ca&s;ed with <HI>Por|celane</HI> Tiles.</P>
<P>Here are three or four very good <HI>Kans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">KANS.</NOTE> built two Stories high, co|vered with Lead, each Room a Cuppalo over it. For this Town is a great Thorow-fare, and of much Traffick; all the <HI>Caravans</HI> com|ing from <HI>Smyrna, Aleppo,</HI> and mo&s;t part of tho&s;e from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by this Place. The <HI>Ba&s;ars</HI> are well built, and fur|ni&s;hed with Merchants, and all &s;orts of Merchandizes: A great deal of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth is brought hither, and no &s;mall quantity of Silk made here; the Plains being covered with Mulberry-Trees, to feed the Silk-Worms.</P>
<P>Here many of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eem to live more gentilely than ordinary, and have their Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure without the Town. One I &s;aw
<PB N="217" REF="75">belonging to a <HI>Haga,</HI> well contrived with &s;hady Walks, Chio&s;ques, Fountains, and Artificial Fi&s;h-Ponds. Here Dr. <HI>Covel</HI> made me take notice of a Willow-Tree, who&s;e large Branches were &s;o limber, that they bend down to the Ground, from a good high-pollard Trunk, and naturally make a curious &s;hady Bower about it. The Leaf is like our O&s;iers. There is plenty of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions here, and mo&s;t delicious Fruits; e&s;pecially Pomegranates, which are e&s;teemed &s;o good, that they are &s;ent from thence to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> for the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s eating. Great plenty of excellent Fre&s;h-Water-Fi&s;h; which the Lake on the Mountain, and others not far off, with the River <HI>A&s;canius,</HI> not a days Journey thence, furni&s;heth them with: E&s;pecially Carps, Trouts, and Eeles. Of the fir&s;t I &s;aw many, and eat of &s;ome three Foot in length, with their large Bellies filled with fat. Of the la&s;t we were made a Pre&s;ent of one, by an <HI>Armenian</HI> that had been in <HI>England,</HI> above an Ell long, large, and white as Silver. This <HI>Armenian</HI> inform|ed us, That the Mountain was almo&s;t covered with curious Plants; which made Dr. <HI>Covel,</HI> who is a great Lover of them, as well as my &s;elf, long to go and ran&s;ack it; which the &s;tay we made being long|er than we thought, by rea&s;on that Mr. <HI>Cary</HI> fell &s;ick here, gave us opportunity to do. So that, <HI>Monday</HI> the Eleventh of <HI>October,</HI> about five a Clock in the Morning, having hired Hor&s;es for two Dollars, five Timins to our Janizary, and as much to our Guide; &s;etting out, and beginning to mount <HI>Olympus,</HI> we came up to the highe&s;t part we could for the Snow, about Eleven a Clock. Whence from a pointed Hill, on the North-&s;ide, we had a mo&s;t Charming Pro&s;pect: the height making it from North to South unbounded, the We|&s;tern half of the Compa&s;s; from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> all the <HI>Propontis,</HI> the Plains of <HI>My&s;ia</HI> to Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> with the Lake and River <HI>A&s;canius,</HI> lay plain before us as in a Map: But more particularly thus.</P>
<P>The two Bays we pa&s;&s;ed by over the <HI>Propontis,</HI> lay parallel to each other North; that of <HI>I&s;hmit</HI> &s;tretching it &s;elf farthe&s;t Ea&s;t; this of <HI>Mountania</HI> having one Lake on the Ea&s;t end, which I &s;up|po&s;e emptieth it &s;elf into the <HI>Propontis</HI> by it; and another in a Valley, near to the Foot of this Mountain. North-We&s;t by North, the I&s;land <HI>Chalcis,</HI> &amp;c. and a little more We&s;t-ward, <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> as they &s;ay, an hundred Miles di&s;tant: but I cannot judge it quite &s;o much. Ju&s;t again&s;t the Mouth of the Bay of <HI>Mountania,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI>'s I&s;land, as &s;ome of the Country now call it, and in old time <HI>Besbicus.</HI> We&s;t we had the Plain of <HI>Prou&s;a,</HI> &s;trewed with Villages, and here and there a con&s;iderable Town: South-We&s;t, the River <HI>A&s;|canius,</HI> with the Lake full of little I&s;lands. There is a Plain on the top of the Monntain, &s;urrounded with little Hills, pointed with Rocks; from whence many Springs ari&s;e, and collect them&s;elves into a pretty Stream, full of little Trouts; &s;ome of which our Guide caught with his hands. But the greate&s;t part of the Stream cometh from a large Lake Ea&s;t-ward; which we could not come to, becau&s;e the way was covered with Snow: From whence the large Carps, and Eeles, I be|fore mentioned, are caught; and Trouts of &s;uch Fame, that they have gotten the good Name of all other Fi&s;h in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lan|guage,
<PB N="218" REF="76">who call them <HI>Alagballuck,</HI> the <HI>Good Fi&s;h:</HI> And therefore the be&s;t of them u&s;ed to be carried to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> as a mo&s;t deli|cate di&s;h.</P>
<P>It is now time to tell you what luck we had a &s;impling, the chief end of our mounting &s;o high: For after we had taken this Pro|&s;pect, and baited our &s;elves, I left Dr. <HI>Covel</HI> de&s;igning the Trout: So ranging from top to top of the Mountain, I gathered all the new things I met with, and in two hours time returned with more curious Plants, than I could ever &s;ince find Names for: But &s;uch as I have found, are as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Towards the Foot of the Mountain, a&s;cending the fir&s;t Mile or two, are abundance of Che&s;nut-Trees, that bear the large&s;t and be&s;t Nuts I ever &s;aw or ta&s;ted; with other &s;orts of ordinary Trees.</P>
<P N="2">2. Something higher I ob&s;erved many Lime-Trees, and towards the top, and on the top, Groves of a &s;ort of Firr-Trees, which Dr. <HI>Co|vel</HI> and I took for Cedar-Trees, becau&s;e they bear the Cones upwards, not hanging downwards, as the other Firr-Trees do; and the &s;ame &s;hape with the Cedar, <HI>viz.</HI> thick and &s;hort like an Egg, and of a brown reddi&s;h colour, and the Smell of the Cones and Gum very O|doriferous. The Leaves al&s;o are not &s;haped like others; but thicker, duller pointed, and have two Stripes of white on the back-&s;ide, like <HI>Oxyjuniper.</HI> It beareth the Branches round the Body orderly, from the bottom to the top, at &s;everal di&s;tances, le&s;s and le&s;s unto the top; where the Cones grow upon the young Branches upright. I cannot tell whether it be not the <HI>Male-Pine;</HI> for this <HI>Ca&s;par Ban|hinus,</HI> in his <HI>Pinax,</HI> calleth the <HI>Male</HI> al&s;o. <HI>Abies, conis &s;ur&s;um &s;pectan|tibus, &s;ive mas.</HI> It agreeth al&s;o with <HI>Gerard</HI>'s De&s;cription of the &s;ame, excepting that the Body is &s;mooth, without Knots at the bottom: For the Branches of this begin very near the Ground, and &s;pread a|broad very large; and that he &s;aith, The Cones are longer than any of the Coniferous Plants; whereas this (as I before &s;aid) hath the Cone thick, and &s;horter than any other in proportion. It agreeth very well with the De&s;cription he giveth of the Cedar of Mount <HI>Libanus;</HI> but I doubt, it wanteth the hardne&s;s: for I &s;aw many rotten Trees of this; but, if I remember right, of &s;omewhat a red|di&s;h colour. And al&s;o Mr. <HI>Gerard</HI> faileth, in that he &s;aith, The Leaves of that of <HI>Libanus</HI> are &s;horter, and not &s;o &s;harp pointed; whereas many of tho&s;e Branches, that I have &s;een, have the Leaves much &s;hor|ter indeed, but more &s;harp pointed than this.</P>
<P>To conclude, This Tree groweth in great plenty upon the Moun|tains of <HI>Greece</HI> al&s;o; as <HI>Citheron</HI> and <HI>Helicon;</HI> and <HI>Parna&s;&s;us:</HI> which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Nanteul</HI> ob&s;erving, who had been upon Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> and the&s;e al&s;o, affirmed, That they were the very &s;ame. But although he is a very curious and ingenious Man, yet I doubt his Curio&s;ity doth not con&s;i&s;t in narrowly di&s;tingui&s;hing Plants. Therefore this mu&s;t be either another kind of Firr, or <HI>Gerard</HI> hath failed in his De|&s;cription
<PB N="219" REF="76">of it. I am rather induced to think it is a kind Firr, be|cau&s;e the <HI>Greeks</HI> yet call this Tree <GAP DESC="foreign">, which &s;ignifieth no other than a Firr-Tree; and that it was never heard of, that Cedars of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e of Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> grew in <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3.

On the top are Knots of Seeds, divided into Three. The Flowers I &s;aw not.

I cannot be po&s;i|tive, whether I &s;aw the Flower or no: but if my Memory doth not very much fail me, I did, and it was a reddi&s;h colour.

<P N="21">21. On the Mountain, in plain Places, where &s;tanding Water had been, I gathered a kind of <HI>Gnaphalium,</HI> which I find not de&s;cribed. It is mo&s;t like the <HI>Leontopodium</HI> of <HI>Gerard:</HI> But whereas he &s;ays, That ri&s;eth a handful high; This creepeth, and lieth flat on the Ground. From a little blacki&s;h Root, &s;preade five or &s;ix, or more downy Stems, of about an Inch long; on which are commonly half a dozen white &s;harp Leaves, three long ones, and three &s;hort ones, like the <HI>Stoechas Citrina,</HI> I but now mentioned: Within which is a greeni&s;h yellow Flower. I believe each of them take root, and produce many more of the &s;ame? For it &s;preadeth irregularly very much abroad; where|of this I have now de&s;cribed, is but a &s;lip, although it is root|ed.</P>
<P N="22">22. I was &s;hewed a dried Herb, that groweth on this Mountain, whereof the Powder is made, we commonly call <HI>Tutti.</HI> D^r <HI>Pickering</HI> called it <HI>Herba Tuitia.</HI> I &s;aw it only dry; but it &s;eemeth both in Root, Leaves, and Flower, to be very like our ordinary <HI>Field-Cow|&s;lip;</HI> only the Leaves are much longer, and the Cups that contain the Flowers, rather like <HI>Auricula &V;r&s;i;</HI> and the Flowers of a reddi&s;h colour, of five little Leaves, each with a notch al&s;o at the top. They &s;ay, when it is blown, there is a Du&s;t that may be &s;haken off this Plant, which is the be&s;t Powder.</P>
<P>This <HI>Armenian</HI> told us, There groweth a World of other curious Plants, and fair Flowers, about this Mountain; but that the time of Year to &s;ee them, was pa&s;t. As for me, I was glad I found the&s;e, and &s;orry that Night grew &s;o near, that I was forced to de&s;i&s;t &s;earching them, to find the way down; which we did with difficulty enough, not being half way down before the Night over-took us; nor ar|rived we to the <HI>Kan,</HI> before ten or eleven at Night.</P>
<P>I was carried to a <HI>Turki&s;h Quack-Salver,</HI> a Man reputed for his Skill in Phy&s;ick among them; where I &s;aw a great many ordinary Herbs, dried in bundles: &s;ome I knew not; perhaps it was becau&s;e ill dri|ed. All that I &s;aw green, was an Herb much like <HI>Germander,</HI> on|ly the Snips of the Leaves were &s;harp, and not round like That. But perhaps, it may be a kind of it. I ob&s;erved nothing of the Smell, nor did I &s;ee the Flower: But the Root is hard and woody.</P>
<P>Near the Town, in the High-way, groweth <HI>Periploca Latifolio,</HI> in great plenty; differing from that which <HI>Gerard</HI> de&s;cribeth, <HI>page</HI> 902. only, that towards the ground, it is of a &s;hrubby Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>We finding M^r <HI>Cary,</HI> as the Doctor thought, in a mending Condi|tion, but that it would not be po&s;&s;ible for him, in many days, to tra|vel &s;uch a Journey; we at la&s;t re&s;olved to proceed in ours, and leave him to God's Ble&s;&s;ing, and under Him to the care of D^r <HI>Covel,</HI> his Spiritual Phy&s;ician, and the <HI>Armenian</HI> his Acquaintance, and two Men, their Servants. But not long after we came to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> we heard of his Death, not without &s;u&s;picion of a malignant Di&s;temper, brought with him from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> So that <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the thirteenth of
<PB N="224" REF="79"><HI>October,</HI> we parted thence; but not above a Mile out of Town that Evening, to <HI>Capligi;</HI> where are the Baths of natural hot Waters; but adorned with noble Structures of Marble over them, covered with Cup|paloes of Lead. It being Afternoon, the time when the Women bathe only, the Men in the Forenoon, we could not enter into the Chiefe&s;t. Only into one, built by the Piety of a potent Man of the Country, with Lodgings to it, commodious for the u&s;e of Strangers: The <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> of which is not great, but of Marble, and covered with a Cuppalo, with Bell-Gla&s;&s;es here and there, to let in the Light, but not the Air. The Doctor and I concluded, That the Water here is much hotter than ours in <HI>England;</HI> it not being po&s;&s;ible to be endured, without tempering it with cold Water.</P>
<P>I was &s;urprized the next Morning, when I came to get on Hor&s;e|back, that I had no Bridle: For, not knowing their Cu&s;tom, I had forgot to put it into my Bargain; which was three Dollars a Hor&s;e to <HI>Smyrna.</HI> But I made our Guide to get me one, before I would part thence. But, as my Companion ob&s;erveth, I learned afterwards in <HI>Greece</HI> to be le&s;s nice: For there we were &s;ometimes mounted like <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> in the Capitol, without Bridle or Saddle. However, we parted before it was day; and having rid through a plain South-we&s;t from this place, part being well tilled, and part Pa&s;ture; &s;tock|ed with Cows, Hor&s;es, and Boufalos; a &s;ort of Cattle not much dif|fering from Oxen; only they love the Water better, and are much wor&s;e Meat; but labour extreamly well. We &s;taid to bait our &s;elves at a little <HI>Greek</HI> Village; but not our Hor&s;es: for they are accu&s;tom|ed to travel all day without it, in <HI>Turkey.</HI> After Dinner we proceed|ed &s;till through a Country, much of the &s;ame Nature with that in the Morning; only here and there &s;ome little Hills, that gave us good Pro&s;pects of the other parts of the &s;pacious Campagne. This day we met with half a dozen of Hor&s;e-men, which we took to be Robbers; and not without rea&s;on, as we were afterwards informed. But with our Janizary we took from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Doctor's, and M^r <HI>Ber|nardi&s;ton</HI>'s Men, we were &s;even of us well armed, be&s;ides our Guides: So that we were not afraid of a greater force than theirs. An hour and an half, or two Hours, we went along, not far di&s;tant at our left hand, a fine Lake, as we judg'd it, about twenty five Miles long, and about &s;even or eight broad; through which the River <HI>A&s;canius</HI> runneth, as we then judged, and the Lake it &s;elf, to have been &s;o called al&s;o; but I rather believe it to be the <HI>Rhyndicus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RHYNDICUS <HI>fl.</HI></NOTE> It is &s;ull of little I&s;lands, and one good large one; on which is a con&s;iderable Village of <HI>Greeks.</HI> At la&s;t we came to the Banks of the River, which here runneth We&s;t|wards; along which I found the <HI>Glycyrrhiza Echinata,</HI> or <HI>Hedgehog Licorice,</HI> de&s;cribed by <HI>Gerard</HI> 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0.

<P>We lodged here at a <HI>Greek</HI> Fi&s;her-Man's Hou&s;e, who pre&s;ented us with an admirable Carp, take out of the River, whereof it abound|eth, weighing, as we judged, at lea&s;t a dozen pound. There are ex|cellent Trouts al&s;o, as the Doctor informed us, he had often eaten here.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the fifteenth, we parted from <HI>Lubat</HI> early, making South-wards; and after &s;even Hours riding through the fruitful Plains of <HI>My&s;ia,</HI> we baited at a Well, near a &s;mall Village, called <HI>Shettiqui.</HI> We were di|verted this Morning by a <HI>Haga,</HI> &s;ent as an Inqui&s;itor after the Thieves we met with, the Morning before. He had at lea&s;t a dozen of Servants, and Friends, that waited upon, and accompanied him. But he &s;eemed to be better prepared to hunt Hares and Partridges, than to catch Thieves: For he had two brace of Grey-hounds with him, and a Hawk. He joyned very civilly with us, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, in|vited us to take part of his Sport: which we did, he &s;till hunting a|long our way, in the Corn-fields. We had good &s;port both in Cour|&s;ing and Hawking: We chaced three Hares, and killed one; and had a flight after a Partridge, but without &s;ucce&s;s. After this he invited us to Dinner with him; which our Doctor and Merchant excu&s;ed, be|ing jealous of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Kindne&s;s. Here I fir&s;t took notice, That the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Grey-hounds differ from ours, having their Heads and Ears like a Spa|niel; but otherwi&s;e well made to run.</P>
<P>After we had baited, we pur&s;ued our way over &s;everal Plains and Hills, which often afforded us a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect of Mount <HI>O|lympus,</HI> that had now contracted it &s;elf into a much le&s;s compa&s;s, pro|portioned to our view: Yet its hoary Head &s;hewed it &s;elf more lofty at that di&s;tance; being before hid from our &s;ight by its broad Shoul|ders. Here we pa&s;&s;ed over a little River, running into the <HI>Granicus;</HI> and towards the Evening, came to the Banks of the <HI>Granicus</HI> it &s;elf: which was the fir&s;t Theater of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s great Glory. For here he overcame <HI>Darius</HI> his Governours, and with them all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> within <HI>Tau|rus,</HI> unto the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI> We went &s;ometime along the Banks; and about two Hours before Night, we pa&s;&s;ed it over a Wooden Bridge, &s;u&s;tained by Piles of Stone; which, perhaps, were formerly to hold up the Stone Arches of it.

There grow wild al&s;o abundance of <HI>Plane-Trees,</HI> along the River; which after we had pa&s;&s;ed, we came to our <HI>Conack,</HI> about a Mile or two further, at a Village on the Ri|ver, called <HI>Su&s;ugerli;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SUSUGERLI.</NOTE> that is as much as to &s;ay, the place of <HI>Bou|falo's.</HI> Here is a good <HI>Kan,</HI> but we lay not at it; but at a <HI>Turk</HI>'s Hou&s;e, as bad: For We and our Hor&s;es were treated in the &s;ame Room; the difference was only, that we were &s;et up a little higher, on a <HI>Sofa,</HI> on one &s;ide of the Room; and they on the other &s;ide, on the Ground. Our Supper was <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pa&s;ties, that were made of Meat minced fine, Marrow, Bread crummed, and Sugar; baked between two Leaves of Pa&s;te in Tin-pans. The next Di&s;h was <HI>Dulma;</HI> which is a Compound of Meat, Suet, Onyons, and Spice, made up like Sau&s;age-Meat wrap|ped in Cabbage, or Vine-Leaves, and are either boiled or fried; and then &s;erved with a little Vinegar on them, and are both very good. The third was a chief Di&s;h among the <HI>Turks,</HI> like to <HI>Pilau,</HI> which is ordinarily made of Rice; but this was Wheat, or Barley, peeled, and boil'd with a Hen, or other Meat. They call it <HI>Tragana.</HI> Afterwards we had a Banquet of Sweet-Meats, made of boiled Wine.</P>
<P>The next Morning we parted early, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;till along the <HI>Gra|nicus;</HI> where I remarked growing abundance of <HI>A&s;phodelus junci folio.</HI> Six or &s;even Miles further, over the Water, D^r <HI>Pickering</HI> made us ob|&s;erve at a di&s;tance the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle; which is thought to have been built by <HI>Alexander,</HI> when he pa&s;&s;ed this River. This Country beareth little, be&s;ides Corn and Pa&s;ture, becau&s;e only inhabited by <HI>Turks:</HI> no Vineyards, nor Wine to be had.</P>
<P>About Mid-way we came to pa&s;s between two Ridges of a Mountain; where &s;tandeth an old <HI>Kan,</HI> called the <HI>Iron Gate,</HI> from the Gate of the <HI>Kan,</HI> which was &s;uch. The antient Name was <HI>M. Timnus,</HI> as near as I can gue&s;s by <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> This is a noted place for Robbers; which made us keep clo&s;e together, and &s;tand to our Arms. And not above two or three Miles thence, when we lighted to bait by a Fountain in the Fields, by the way we found the Skull of a Man; who in all likelihood had been murdered, travelling the Road.</P>
<P>This Morning we over-took, and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal great <HI>Caravans,</HI> of Camels and Dromedaries; each Drove of which had an A&s;s, or Mule, to lead the way; all bound for <HI>Smyrna.</HI> We made our <HI>Conack,</HI> or days Journey, by three or four of the Clock in the Afternoon, arriving at a Village called <HI>Mandragorai;</HI> a pitiful place, con&s;i&s;ting only of a few Hutts, built of Earth, baked in the Sun. We lodged in the <HI>Kan;</HI> which was no better than a large Barn, with a <HI>Sopha</HI> or Bank round the Wall of it within, rai&s;ed from the Ground about a foot and half,
<PB N="227" REF="80">or two foot high, eight foot broad; and at every eight, or ten foot di|&s;tance, a little Chimney; between which Spaces they lie: the <HI>Kan</HI>-keeper bringing only Ru&s;h-Matts, on which we laid our Quilts we brought with us. In the Chimney we might dre&s;s our Meat our &s;elves, or chu&s;e to fa&s;t. Our Hor&s;es were tied at our Beds-feet to Po&s;ts; and upon &s;o much of the <HI>Sopha,</HI> as the Bed does not take up, are fed with chopped Straw and Barley. For they feed their Hor&s;es here with neither Hay nor Oats, but Straw; which maketh them light&s;ome, and never pur&s;ey. This <HI>Kan</HI> is held up in the middle by Marble Pillars, &s;et confu&s;edly on their <HI>Corinthian</HI> Capitals, of very curious Work; which made us believe, that this had been &s;ome more antient place. My Companion, from the re&s;emblance of the Name, thinketh, That it might have been the City <HI>Mandropolis,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI> to be in <HI>Phrygia,</HI> where then we were.</P>
<P>From this <HI>Kan</HI> is a little Walk to a &s;mall Stream, which they &s;ay is the River <HI>Granicus.</HI> But this upon more collect Thoughts, I do not believe; nor that the River we pa&s;&s;ed the day before, and this, are one and the &s;ame River: For I have noted in my Journal, That we pa&s;&s;ed by the River &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>Granicus,</HI> again&s;t the Stream; which is impo&s;&s;ible, if the other be true, having pa&s;&s;ed it the day before run|ning We&s;t-wards. For I remember, that when at la&s;t we pa&s;&s;ed that &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Granicus,</HI> it was near the Mountains, over which we went; and but a &s;mall Stream, &s;haded with <HI>Plane</HI>-Trees, near the <HI>Iron-Gate;</HI> not far from whence, I believed the Spring to ri&s;e. The exa|mining of which hath made another Errour manife&s;t to me; which is, That the Lake and River pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Lupadi,</HI> is not the <HI>A&s;canius,</HI> as is generally believed; and that the mouths of it, and the <HI>Granicus,</HI> are a va&s;t way off one from the other, if any credit may be given to <HI>Pto|lomy</HI>'s Tables. My Opinion is, fir&s;t, That that Lake before-mentioned, North of <HI>Olympus,</HI> and the River from it, is the true <HI>A&s;canius,</HI> empty|ing it &s;elf into the <HI>Sinus Cianus</HI> of the <HI>Propontis:</HI> For both <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> make the <HI>A&s;canius</HI> to be in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> as all Geographers place it: only a French-man, one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Phide,</HI> will have it in the middle of <HI>Galatia;</HI> which is manife&s;tly fal&s;e. Secondly, That River pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Lupadi,</HI> or <HI>Lubat,</HI> I believe to be the <HI>Rhyndicus;</HI> and tho&s;e next Streams may probably be tho&s;e, which collect them&s;elves to make the <HI>Granicus;</HI> but then they fall not into that River with the Lake, by <HI>Lubat,</HI> if <HI>Ptolomy</HI> is true: but if they do, it is but part of the <HI>Rhyndicus,</HI> and not the <HI>Granicus.</HI> For he giveth the Fountain, and Mouth of that River above a Degrees difference in Longitude and La|titude. But as to the <HI>Granicus,</HI> he giveth no account at all of the Fountain, but only of the Mouth, which he placeth between <HI>Parium</HI> and <HI>Lamp&s;acus,</HI> emptying it &s;elf into the <HI>Propontis,</HI> nor yet of the Ri|ver <HI>Ae&s;opus.</HI> Wherefore the&s;e may be e&s;teemed &s;ome other Rivers of <HI>Phrygia,</HI> or <HI>My&s;ia Minor,</HI> or <HI>Helle&s;pontick My&s;ia;</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e to be extended until the Mountain, by the <HI>Iron-Gate,</HI> or Mount <HI>Timnus,</HI> now mentioned: Whence al&s;o I believe <HI>My&s;ia major</HI> begins, and reach|eth unto the Mountain by <HI>Thyatira.</HI> Thirdly, This River at <HI>Mandragorai</HI> abovementioned, is, mo&s;t probably, the <HI>Caicus:</HI> who&s;e Fountain <HI>Ptolomy</HI> putteth in the &s;ame Latitude with the <HI>Rhyndicus,</HI> but not in the &s;ame
<PB N="228" REF="81">Longitude: and <HI>Strabo</HI> makes the <HI>Caicus</HI> to pa&s;s through the be&s;t part of <HI>My&s;ia,</HI> before it comes to <HI>Pergamo.</HI> But this by the way. I was going to tell what Plants I found by it, in my Walk this Evening.</P>

</LIST>
<P>The next morning we parted thence, and &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the River: Whence up and down in a rough Mountainous Country, we travelled till about three in the Afternoon; when we arrived at a Village un|der a Mountain, called <HI>Courougouli,</HI> or the <HI>Dry Lake.</HI> For the Plain round about in Winter is filled with Water, like a Lake, and in the Summer is dry.</P>
<P>Plants here ob&s;erved, were</P>

Mine agreeth well with common <HI>Moonwort;</HI> only the Leaves of it, as it groweth bigger, put out here and there a little Angle, and grow round about it, near the ground, in a Tuft: Whence it &s;endeth but a &s;ingle Stalk, as I ob&s;erved in mo&s;t of them, &s;et with o|val Shields, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the whole Plant very woolly, like Woollen Cloth, as it yet remaineth in my Book. But that change may happen through Alteration of Climate.</P>

<P N="2">2. But the Plant which plea&s;ed me mo&s;t to &s;ee here, was a mo&s;t beautiful kind of <HI>Origanum,</HI> with long purple Flowers. Mr. <HI>Merchant</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="81">calleth it <HI>Origanum Heracleoticum, Flore purpureo:</HI> But Dr. <HI>Mori&s;on</HI> much better hath named it <HI>Origanum &s;picatum.</HI> It is an <HI>Origanum</HI> dif|ferent from any, that hath been &s;een in our parts. From black; &s;tringy, and creeping Roots, ri&s;e up many downy, round Stalks, be&s;et in pairs of Leaves, at fir&s;t &s;omewhat downy, and ribbed with &s;uch &s;mall Ribs, as are hardly perceiveable to the Touch. The Shape is round near the Stem, and endeth in a &s;harp point, like the &s;mall Myrtle. The&s;e &s;hoot a foot and half, or two foot high from the Ground; the Stalk and Leaves growing &s;mooth; and towards the top, in pairs, it &s;endeth out very &s;mall Twigs, which end in a &s;caly Flower, like a Hop, &s;ometimes near an inch long, and of a light purple colour; between who&s;e &s;cales come &s;mall Purple Flowers. When they are brui&s;ed, they &s;end forth a weak Scent, &s;omething re&s;embling <HI>Stoecas Arabicus.</HI> I found it both in Flow|er and Seed; with which I have furni&s;hed &s;everal Gardens: And it flou|ri&s;heth now very well, at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we pa&s;&s;ed over a good high Mountain, whence we had the Pro&s;pect of a large Plain, Ea&s;t of us; and came very early to <HI>Ba&s;culumbai,</HI> a Village of about two or three hundred Hou&s;es;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BASCULUM|BAI.</NOTE> having a <HI>Kan,</HI> and three <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> al&s;o. We lodged at an Acquaintance of the Doctor's, a <HI>Turk,</HI> that made as much of us as he could. This place tradeth much in <HI>Cotton.</HI> I took notice of the In&s;trument, they &s;epa|rate the Seed from the <HI>Cotton</HI> with; which is only two Rowls; one of Wood, about two or three inches diameter; and another &s;mall one of Iron, &s;et in a frame &s;o as to rouch one another: each of which being turn'd round, the other turneth al&s;o, and letteth the Cotton pa&s;s between, as it goeth about, but leaveth the round Seeds behind. Here I ob&s;erved a little River, which may fall into the <HI>Caicus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the Nineteenth of <HI>October,</HI> we parted hence early in the morning; and about a Mile from the Town, left the common Road to <HI>Smyrna</HI> on the right hand, and pa&s;&s;ed through a plea&s;ant Country, mixed with Woods and Pa&s;tures, until we came to a Mountain, &s;tretch|ed out in length Ea&s;t and We&s;t; yet not very high. It hath a Gap in the middle, through which we pa&s;&s;ed along a Stream; great part of which is carried in Aqueducts under-ground to <HI>Thyatira.</HI> This Moun|tain is &s;uppo&s;ed to part <HI>My&s;ia major</HI> and <HI>Lydia.</HI> To defend this Pa&s;&s;age, on the right hand, a good height, are the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle, cal|led by the Turks <HI>Akei&s;ar,</HI> or <HI>White Ca&s;tle;</HI> as they do al&s;o now call <HI>Thyatira;</HI> which we &s;aw from hence, over a Plain, about two Miles further South, and arrived thither about Noon.</P>
<P><HI>Thyatira</HI> is a very antient City in <HI>Lydia,</HI> or in the Confines of <HI>My&s;ia,</HI> a Colony of the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> according to <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ituate almo&s;t in the mid-way between <HI>Pergamo</HI> and <HI>Sardis,</HI> in a very delightful Plain. But &s;ince more famous in Holy Writ; being one of tho&s;e Churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the Son of God vouch&s;afed to write to by the Holy Apo&s;tle, S^t <HI>John:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THYATIRA.</NOTE> &s;hewing them what they mu&s;t look for, if they did not reclaim them|&s;elves from the Fornication, with which they were polluted through the per&s;wa&s;ion of &s;ome, who taught them to eat Meats offered unto Idols, thereby to di&s;&s;emble the Truth: Upon which warning, how well they reformed, is uncertain: But certain, that Chri&s;tianity is al|mo&s;t extinct in this place; there being not above ten Chri&s;tians in the
<PB N="230" REF="82">Town, de&s;titute both of Church and Prie&s;t. Their Patience and Suf|fering undoubtedly is great, among that di&s;proportionable number of Infidels: For the Town is very populous in <HI>Turks,</HI> and may contain four or five thou&s;and Souls. Its antient Temporal, as well as Spiritual Beauty, is de&s;troyed; its Marble Buildings are buried in their own Ruins; Hou&s;es built of Clods of Earth, and dried in the Sun, only remaining; and its once glorious Name obliterated: In&s;omuch that a very little while ago, none knew where it was to be found, nor where it did &s;tand. Some thought, with the ignorant <HI>Greeks,</HI> that it was <HI>Tyreth,</HI> a Town South-Ea&s;t of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> about twenty Miles: where they pretend, they have the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e</HI> of S^t <HI>John</HI>'s own writing, as I have heard: Until the Curio&s;ity, and Piety of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> M^r <HI>Ricaut,</HI> with &s;everal of the Merchants, who&s;e Devotions were rai&s;ed by their Mini&s;ter M^r <HI>Lake,</HI> gave a Period to this gro&s;s Er|rour, by finding this to be the antient <HI>Thyatira.</HI> For they met with ma|ny In&s;criptions here; where the name <HI>Thyatira</HI> is mentioned; of which all we could find, being a dozen, we copied with as great exactne&s;s as we could; which gave us a great deal of News of this Place.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t we were &s;hewed, was at a kind of <HI>Bazar,</HI> or <HI>Town-Hou&s;e;</HI> and is the <HI>Pede&s;tal</HI> of a Statue, erected in Honour of <HI>Aurelius Proclus,</HI> wherein we read,

<P>A great many <HI>Turks</HI> came &s;taring upon us, to &s;ee what we did; who, when we told them, That that Stone had on it the antient Name of the City, in the time of the Pagans, and was called <HI>Thyatira,</HI> wondred at the News; while two or three of them told us, They knew where there were more of them; and pre&s;ently conducted us to one, at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Vezi Chelibi,</HI> made hollow to contain Water.</P>

<P>Upon a Pillar in the <HI>Kan,</HI> that the Emperour <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> had here or|dered their ways to be made the &s;ixth Year of his Con&s;ul&s;hip: And out of Con&s;ul <HI>Ricaut</HI>'s Remarks, an In&s;cription &s;hewed, That the Em|perour <HI>Severus</HI> was honoured by the very great City of <HI>Thyatira.</HI> Both which made me believe, That they did but flatter the Emperour <HI>Ca|racalla,</HI> in calling him their <HI>Founder,</HI> or <HI>Re&s;torer:</HI> Perhaps it was, be|cau&s;e he granted them &s;ome Priviledges they before wanted. This Town is well water'd, and hath little Rivulets running in &s;everal Streets. Here are &s;even Mo&s;ques; one of them a Chri&s;tian &s;hewed us, and told us, It had been a Chri&s;tian Church. The point of its <HI>Minoret</HI> is bro|ken; and the rea&s;on that they give, is, That it having been a Chri|&s;tian Church, God will not &s;uffer it to &s;tand. For it hath been &s;eve|ral times built, or &s;et up; and as often &s;uddenly thrown down. On the out-&s;ide were &s;hewed us two In&s;criptions. Here are al&s;o two <HI>Kans;</HI> in one of which we lodged, being of one &s;tory: &s;u&s;tained by thirty Marble Pillars of divers Proportions and Orders; who&s;e curious wrought Capitals are now become their <HI>Pede&s;tals.</HI> Some of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Or|der were carved with Leaves on the Fu&s;ts, as well as the Capitals, partly chanelled, and partly carved; like tho&s;e you may &s;ee in the Front of the Temple at <HI>Mila&s;&s;o;</HI> being a kind of Ornament not or|dinary. And as to &s;uch lea&s;ed Pillars, Mr. <HI>Galante,</HI> Antiquary to the <HI>French</HI> King, gives my Comrade this his Remark. There is a Chio&s;que, or Pavilion, near <HI>Ingerliqui,</HI> on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> towards the Black Sea, built by <HI>Sultan Solyman;</HI> the Foundation of which con&s;i&s;ts of many Pillars: among&s;t the re&s;t one of about a foot and half Diameter; of which is &s;een not above two foot of the end, towards the Ba&s;e, boulting out
<PB N="237" REF="85">of the Foundation, in imitation of Canons, as the re&s;t do. But this is particularly remarkable, for the carving towards the Ba&s;e with <HI>Vine Bran|ches,</HI> mixed with Figures of &s;everal &s;orts of Creatures, as Beetles and Snails, with two Ma&s;ques, and a Ve&s;&s;el full of Grapes, trodden by three Men: all excellent work. Without doubt, this was taken from the Temple of <HI>Bacchus;</HI> of which <HI>Petrus Gillius</HI> maketh mention in his De&s;crip|tion of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> For &s;peaking of the Pillars, he &s;aith thus: <HI>Ca|pitula inferiorum Echinos habent circumdantes imam partem; reliqua pars e&s;t tota ve&s;tita foliis.</HI> But he had not ob&s;erved them very nearly. By a Fountain hard by this <HI>Kan,</HI> I ob&s;erved a <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo</HI> of Plenty, and a <HI>Pedestal</HI> of a Statue, great part in the ground; which we had not time to dig up, and &s;ee whether it had an In&s;cription upon it: But &s;ome Figures were on the &s;ides.</P>
<P>The other is a le&s;&s;er, but a better <HI>Kan,</HI> of two Stories. The Town is well &s;erved with ordinary Provi&s;ions. They make a great deal of Cotton here, and &s;end it to <HI>Smyrna;</HI> which from hence is but two &s;mall days Journeys.</P>
<P>In our way thither I ob&s;erved among the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Broom, and other Shrubs, that which <HI>Ca&s;p. Bauhinus</HI> calleth <HI>Spartium alterum mono&s;permum,</HI> and <HI>P&s;eudo-&s;partium, Hi&s;panicum Aphyllon; Bastard Spani&s;h Broom.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS AT THYATIRA.</NOTE> Here I &s;aw another, in the ploughed Ground, in the Plains, and el&s;ewhere. The Doctor called it <HI>Thap&s;us minor, longifolio;</HI> and told me, It was the only Remedy the People u&s;ed there in all Di&s;ea&s;es. The Leaves are &s;omething in &s;hape like a <HI>Sage-Leaf;</HI> but thick-cover'd, with a bright &s;ilver Hair, like Plu&s;h. The Flowers I &s;aw not: but I e&s;teem it rather to be reduced to the <HI>Sideritis,</HI> than <HI>Thap&s;us;</HI> or rather a kind of <HI>Sta|chys.</HI> For I think it to be the &s;ame I gathered at <HI>Tine,</HI> with Stalks and Seeds.</P>
<P>The next Morning, <HI>October</HI> the twentieth, two hours before day, we left <HI>Thyatira,</HI> guiding our cour&s;e South-We&s;t-wards, and had almo&s;t lo&s;t our way, a little out of the Town, in the dark, and a quaggy wet Ground. But in about two hours time, we foorded a little River, near a Bridge; among the Stones of which one was a Marble, whereon the Name of <HI>Tiberius Cae&s;ar</HI> was engraven; and not a &s;tones ca&s;t further, another River, doubtle&s;s part of the &s;ame Stream: both running North-wards from thence, I believe, to &s;eek the <HI>Caicus</HI> towards <HI>Pergamus.</HI> Thence we pa&s;&s;ed over a Plain, about four or five Miles every way o|ver; and came to a Hill, whence we had the Pro&s;pect of the &s;pacious Plains of <HI>Magne&s;ia,</HI> bounded with Mount <HI>Sipylus</HI> South-wards; at the foot of which we di&s;cerned the City it &s;elf, near five hours before we came to it. A very little more to the Ea&s;t, we &s;aw Mount <HI>Pinolus;</HI> by which is <HI>Sardis.</HI> This Plain is counted fifty or &s;ixty Miles long from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; and near about fifteen broad. It is famous in the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, by the glorious Victory of <HI>Lucius Scipio</HI> over <HI>Antioohus;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Livius,</HI> lib. 57. cap. 58.</NOTE> who therefore de&s;ervedly bare the Title of <HI>A&s;iaticus;</HI> and therein equa|lized him&s;elf with his Brother, who was for the like Atchievement cal|led <HI>Africanus.</HI> I have it in a <HI>Roman</HI> Coin, lately given me among &s;e|veral others, by my worthy Friend, <HI>John Robin&s;on,</HI> E&s;quire; which hath on one &s;ide the Head of an old Man crowned, with Letters defaced; and on the other an <HI>Elephant,</HI> by which is repre&s;ented <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and above
<PB N="238" REF="86">is plainly to be read <HI>SCIPIO;</HI> and under the <HI>Elephant IMP.</HI> for <HI>Imperator.</HI></P>
<P>We baited at a <HI>Turk</HI>'s Country-hou&s;e, &s;omething beyond the middle of the Plain; and about two hours after, arrived at <HI>Magne&s;ia,</HI> about three in the Afternoon; after we had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Hermus,</HI> a con&s;idera|ble River, near a Mile from it; leaving on both &s;ides of its Chanel, a deep moory Ground; which would be impa&s;&s;able, unle&s;s the way were ca&s;t up, and trenched on each &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Magne&s;ia</HI> &s;till retains its antient Name.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MAGNESIA.</NOTE> There were two of them; the one called <HI>Magne&s;ia ad Meandrum,</HI> or upon the River <HI>Meander;</HI> the other <HI>ad Sipylum, Magne&s;ia</HI> at Mount <HI>Sipylus:</HI> at the foot of which, on the North-We&s;t &s;ide, it is fituate. This is to be &s;een in many an|tient Monuments, and Coins; as in one I found at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in the <HI>Ar|menian</HI> Church yard, the Sepulchral Monument of one <HI>Tatias,</HI> Son of <HI>Herothemus,</HI>

<P>The Situation of This and <HI>Prou&s;a,</HI> look much alike delightful, and re&s;emble one another: As that lieth under <HI>Olympus;</HI> &s;o this under <HI>Si|pylus,</HI> and &s;eem to have &s;hared alike in fate; having been its Prede|ce&s;&s;or in the Imperial Seat of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; and remains yet a <HI>Ba&s;halique,</HI> although of late governed by a Deputy, under the Title of <HI>Mo&s;elim;</HI> and is great, populous, and rich, from the Trade it dri|veth in Cotton. We lodged at the Hou&s;e of the Chief of the Janiza|ries; who was eminent in the War of <HI>Candia:</HI> for which this was his Reward now, living in great Repute for his Courage; from being a Servant to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Smyrna.</HI> His Hou&s;e is pretty, and he treat|ed us well. He furni&s;hed us with a Janizary, to &s;ee the <HI>Seraglio</HI> of the Grand <HI>Signior,</HI> when they abode here, as in their chief Imperial City; which is now well near ruined. The Lodgings have a &s;pired Tower, covered with Lead, five &s;tories high; and it had a large Gar|den about it, adorned with Chio&s;ques, Fi&s;h-ponds, Fountains, and Baths. About the Walls, and Trees, I ob&s;erved abundance of Storks; which were now going all away South-wards, Winter growing on: as we daily ob&s;erved them, in va&s;t flights, all the way from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> thither.</P>
<P>They have a great many Mo&s;ques, and Baths here: But the Chri&s;ti|ans, who are few, have only one Church. The Ca&s;tle is on a &s;teep
<PB N="239" REF="86">Hill, between the City, and the Mountain, which I e&s;teem &s;trong, not being commanded by any higher Ground near it. About it are perceivable &s;everal Ranges of Walls one above another; which it may be, were in antient times the chief part of the City. They &s;ay, There is kept an antient <HI>Roman</HI> Helmet; but it being too late, we could not have time to go &s;ee it this Evening; and our Company po&s;ted us away next Morning too early.</P>
<P>The next Morning therefore, <HI>October</HI> the one and twentieth, early we &s;et out from this Town; and in le&s;s than a Mile, We&s;t of it, we began to mount the <HI>Sipylus,</HI> by the ea&s;ie&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, and were above three hours before we could look over that part of it, which is not the highe&s;t by a great deal: for it well de&s;erves to be reckoned among the highe&s;t Mountains of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Hence we had a fair Pro&s;pect of the Plain of <HI>Magne&s;ia,</HI> North, &s;tretching it &s;elf in length Ea&s;t-ward from the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea, which we had We&s;t-wards; and <HI>Smyrna,</HI> with its fair Port, South-We&s;t. And South-Ea&s;t, not very far off the Place where we were, begin Mountains, which &s;tretch them&s;elves far Ea&s;t, through the <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia;</HI> as the Doctor told me, who called it <HI>Elis.</HI> Perhaps it is the beginning of Mount <HI>Taurus.</HI> I would have given much, that I could have had time to &s;earch this Mountain, as I did <HI>Olympus.</HI> But our Company were too near home, to be at lei&s;ure for &s;uch Curio&s;i|ties. Only I had time to take notice of abundance of that <HI>Origanum</HI> I be|fore de&s;cribed: and here I &s;aw &s;ome in its Flowers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS AT MOUNT SI|PYLUS.</NOTE> And therefore being the mo&s;t eminent Place, I call it <HI>Origanum montis Sipyli.</HI> To which I add,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Geni&s;ta minima, &s;pino&s;a.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Another little Plant with &s;ilver Leaves growing to the Ground; which I knew to be a <HI>Scabious,</HI> only by one Seed I found not drop|ped out. It is neare&s;t like the <HI>Scabio&s;a argentea, angu&s;tifolio</HI> of <HI>C. Bau|hinus,</HI> de&s;cribed in his <HI>Prodromus:</HI> But it is le&s;s; the Leaves not nar|rower, but &s;horter, and rounder towards the top, growing without Order near the ground, from a woody Root: from which &s;prings a Stalk, I judge, by the bigne&s;s of that, three or four handfuls high, and branches out into other fine Twigs by pairs: and may be called <HI>Scabio&s;a Argentea minor.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Viola Pentagonea, tenui folio,</HI> as M^r <HI>Merchant</HI> calleth it: But I find it not the &s;ame, nor like any de&s;cribed by <HI>Gerard,</HI> nor named by <HI>C. Bauhinus,</HI> in his <HI>Pinax.</HI> From a &s;mall tender Root ri&s;eth a branchy tender Plant, be&s;et carele&s;ly and thin; with &s;mall long Leaves, like Hy&s;&s;op; which the nearer the top, are yet longer and narrower. On the top is a pale, blue Flower, &s;omewhat inclining to Purple, much larger than the ordinary <HI>Speculum Veneris,</HI> and more tender, of five Leaves, &s;u&s;tained by a Starry Cup, of five points, long and &s;et, as the Leaves, with little Thorns, like the Nettle.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>So &s;oon as we came to the bottom of the Hill, we were met by the Con&s;ul to His Maje&s;ty, M^r <HI>Paul Rycaut,</HI> and many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants, with good Hor&s;es, and well trapped according to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion; as the re&s;t of their own Habits al&s;o were, only their Hats ex|cepted, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Nations. They had pro|vided a Collation for us, about three Miles from the Town, where the
<PB N="240" REF="87">greate&s;t part of the Factory met; and having drank His Maje&s;ty's Health, marched in order, two by two, into <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Smyrna</HI> hath &s;o many Advantages from its natural Situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SMYRNA.</NOTE> that not|with&s;tanding the great Calamities which have befallen it by War, and mo&s;t prodigious Earthquakes, that no le&s;s than &s;ix times have over|thrown, and almo&s;t utterly ruined it; yet it hath &s;till been thought worth the repairing, and re&s;toring to all the Beauty the Art of its In|habitants could contrive to adorn it with: Notwith&s;tanding al&s;o, that from &s;ome old Tradition they expect the Seventh, that &s;hall be its utter Ruin, never to be repaired. It is &s;ituate at the bottom of a Bay, e&s;teemed twenty Miles to its Mouth, &s;ecured with high Mountains on every &s;ide, from all Winds, but the We&s;t. Whence from Sea they can receive no damage: For the <HI>Hermus,</HI> which emptieth it &s;elf into it, maketh a Bank of Sand, that barreth the raging of the Sea out; yet leaves &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age in, although but narrow, that he mu&s;t be a very Ideot of a Pilot, that cannot bring a Ship in &s;afe, into the inmo&s;t part of the Bay; where he may find room, and depth enough, with very good Moorage. This Bay hath Mount <HI>Sipylus</HI> North. Another Moun|tain, which I judged to be the <HI>Me&s;ogis mons,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> North-Ea&s;t: The Hills, whereon the Town &s;tands, from Ea&s;t to South. From thence to the <HI>Promontory, Argennum,</HI> winding a|bout to the We&s;tern point, <HI>Mons Mimas,</HI> now called <HI>the Brothers,</HI> from the two highe&s;t Points. Here is indeed a little Gap, being the mouth of the Bay: but thence Hills begin to ri&s;e again, to joyn to Mount <HI>Si|pylus.</HI> Of this Entrance I &s;hall have occa&s;ion again to &s;peak, when I part hence. But as to the re&s;t, the&s;e Mountains are not &s;o uear, but that they leave fruitful Fields round about between the Bay and them;
<PB N="241" REF="87">well planted with Olive-yards, Vine-yards, and Corn-fields among them; and from the Town to Mount <HI>Sipylus</HI> is a Valley of four or more Miles in length, and near a Mile broad in &s;ome places: which with the Gar|dens about the Town, and the Town it &s;elf, drink up two pretty Streams of good Water; one ri&s;ing North-ward from the Mountain <HI>Sipylus,</HI> and the other Southward, from Mount <HI>Mimas;</HI> which joyn together North-Ea&s;t of the Town; and what it &s;pareth, which is but little, the Sea receiveth at the North-We&s;t end of the Town. That which cometh North-wards from Mount <HI>Sipylus,</HI> is a con&s;iderable Stream, driveth &s;e|ven Mills, and hath abundance of Fi&s;h in it. The other, coming from Mount <HI>Mimas,</HI> is the greate&s;t part brought to the Town in <HI>Aqueducts;</HI> two of which are well built with Stone-Arches, cro&s;&s;ing the Valley, or deep Fo&s;s, which it &s;elf hath dug between two Hills; whereof the Northern-mo&s;t is where Old <HI>Smyrna</HI> &s;tood; now only a Ca&s;tle. The re&s;t of the Water is divided among&s;t the Gardens.</P>
<P><HI>Smyrna</HI> is a place of great Antiquity, and is reputed to have had the <HI>Amazon Smyrna</HI> for its Foundre&s;s. They therefore &s;tamped their Money with the Figure of her Head. I got &s;everal pieces of them very rare, and &s;aw many more, in the Cabinet of an ingenious Merchant there, M^r <HI>Faulkener,</HI> who de&s;igns his Collection for the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Oxford.</HI> One &s;mall one hath her Head crowned with Towers, and her two-edged Hatchet on her Shoulder, almo&s;t worn out with Age; and about it are the&s;e Letters,
&Sgr;&Mgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Ngr;&Agr;;

<MILESTONE N="37">
<P>Of the antient Situation, and Beauty of this place, <HI>Strabo</HI> giveth the be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t Account. <Q>Thence, &s;aith he, de&s;cribing it North-ward from <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> is another Bay, in which is Old <HI>Smyrna,</HI> twenty <HI>Stadia,</HI> or <HI>two Miles and a half,</HI> from the New. When the <HI>Lydians</HI> had de&s;troyed <HI>Smyrna,</HI> the Country thereabout was only inhabited by Villages, for Four hundred Years together. After which <HI>Antigo|nus</HI> re&s;tored it; and after him <HI>Ly&s;imachus.</HI> At this day it is of all the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Cities, mo&s;t beautiful. Part of it is built upon the Moun|tain; but the greater part on the Plain to the Haven, unto the Tem|ple of the Mother of the Gods, and to the <HI>Gymna&s;ium.</HI> The Streets are mo&s;t excellently, and as much as po&s;&s;ible, reduded into right Angles, all paved with Stone. It hath great and &s;quare Porticoes, both in the higher and lower parts of the City. There is a Library, and the <HI>Homerion,</HI> which is a &s;quare Portico, with a Temple, con|taining his Statue. For the <HI>Smyrnoites</HI> are very zealous for the Na|tivity of <HI>Homer</HI> among&s;t them; and have a bra&s;s piece of Money, called by his Name, <HI>Homerion.</HI> The River <HI>Meles</HI> runneth by the Walls. There is a Haven on the other &s;ide of the City, which may be &s;hut up at plea&s;ure. Thus far <HI>Strabo.</HI></Q></P>
<PB N="242" REF="88">
<P>The Old <HI>Smyrna,</HI> that was in his time, in all probability, was on a Hill South of this that is now, and We&s;t of the Ca&s;tle|hill. For there are &s;ome Steps of Heaps of Stones, laid in &s;ome order, as if a Wall had been there. His New <HI>Smyrna,</HI> but the Old one of our times, without doubt took up all the Hill the Old Ca&s;tle &s;tand|eth on, and that adjoyning to it, down to a point, running into the Bay Southwards; and of the Plain much more North-Ea&s;t, than the New <HI>Smyrna</HI> of our times. But North, I believe, not more, if &s;o much. For turning into <HI>Franck-Street</HI> is a Wall, which &s;eemeth to be part of the antient Walls of the City; although the Mouth of the River <HI>Meles,</HI> is ju&s;t without the pre&s;ent Buildings; which is not far, and might ea|&s;ily be turned thither, if nearer to the Walls formerly. Along this Wall from the Sea, you come to the Foundations of a great Building of hewed Stone, they were then demoli&s;hing; which might have been the <HI>Sibyl's</HI> Temple, the great Mother of the Gods.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Homerion</HI> it hath been thought that, which they call the <HI>Temple of Janus,</HI> perhaps from its Similitude to that at <HI>Rome,</HI> becau&s;e it is not far off from the River &s;uppo&s;ed to be the River <HI>Meles.</HI> It is a four &s;quare Stone-building, about three Yards &s;quare, with two doors oppo&s;ite to each other, one North, and the other South; and a large Niche within, again&s;t the Ea&s;t-Wall, where his Image was &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand. But my Comrade receiv'd Letters &s;ince, that digging by it, hath been found a Statue, with a double Vi&s;age; which confirms the o|pinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Med.</HI> 39, 40, 42.</NOTE> That it was the Temple of <HI>Janus.</HI> Of the Bra&s;s Money called by <HI>Homer</HI>'s Name, I did light upon one-piece not long &s;ince, with his Head and Name on one &s;ide, and the Figure, and Name of the River <HI>Meles</HI> on the other, in <HI>Greek</HI> Characters. I &s;aw another among M^r <HI>Faul|keners,</HI> a <HI>Coturniate Medalion,</HI> with his Head and Shoulders, and a Branch before him, having his Name about it. On the Rever&s;e is a Man, leading a Hor&s;e. <HI>Homer</HI>'s Name, in M^r <HI>Faulkener</HI>'s, begins with &OHgr;; but in mine, with &Ogr;.

<P>But other <HI>Remains</HI> of Antiquity, not mentioned by <HI>Strabo,</HI> although none of the lea&s;t, are the <HI>Theater</HI> and <HI>Cirque.</HI> The <HI>Theater</HI> is on the Brow of the Hill, North of the Ca&s;tle, built of white Marble: but now is going to be de&s;troyed, to build the new <HI>Kan,</HI> and <HI>Bazar</HI> hard by the Fort below; which they are now about: and in doing where|of there hath been lately found, in the Foundation, a Pot of Medals, all of the Emperour <HI>Gadlienus</HI> his Family, and the other Tyrants that reigned in his time; which make me believe he built it, or at lea&s;t, that it was done in his days: although my Comrade &s;eemeth to think, it was the Emperour <HI>Claudius;</HI> becau&s;e he found his Name on a piece of a <HI>Pede&s;tal,</HI> in the Scene of it: But I think without rea&s;on.

<P>This is what I had to &s;ay concerning the Antiquity of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> un|der the Heathen Emperours.</P>
<P>But that which was, and ever &s;hall be its true Glory, was their ear|ly Reception of the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> Glorious in the Te&s;timo|ny he hath given of them, and happy in the faithful Promi&s;es he hath made to them. Let us con&s;ider therefore, what he writeth to them by the Evangeli&s;t, S^t <HI>John.</HI> Apoc. 2.9. <HI>I know thy Works, and Tribulati|on, and Poverty; but thou art Rich. And I know the Bla&s;phemy of them that &s;ay, They are</HI> Jews, <HI>and are not: but are the Synagogue of Satan. Fear none of tho&s;e things, which thou &s;talt &s;uffer. Behold, the Devil &s;hall ca&s;t &s;ome of you in Pri&s;on, that ye may be tried: and ye &s;hall have Tri|bulation ten days.

<P>Agreeable to which, in tho&s;e times this Church was as a <HI>Noble Army of Martyrs;</HI> whereof S^r <HI>Polycarp,</HI> their Pa&s;tor, as their <HI>Lieutenant Gene|ral,</HI> was martyred either in the <HI>Theater,</HI> or <HI>Cirque,</HI> by wild Bea&s;ts, His Tomb yet remains on the Hill, bounding the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Cirque,</HI> and is vi&s;ited with great Devotion: But his true Glory is on high. The&s;e Chri&s;tians do yet remain con&s;iderable, and in a far better condi|tion, than any of the re&s;t of tho&s;e Seven Churches. The <HI>Greeks</HI> that are here, have but two Churches; yet they are numerous, this Place being the Seat of their <HI>Metropolitan.</HI> But be&s;ides them, here is a great number of Chri&s;tians of all Nations, Sects, and Languages. The <HI>La|tine</HI> Church hath a Mona&s;tery of <HI>Franci&s;cans:</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> have one Church: But the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable num|ber, next the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> have only a Chapel in the <HI>Con|&s;ul</HI>'s Hou&s;e; which is a &s;hame, con&s;idering the great Wealth they heap up here, beyond all the re&s;t: Yet they commonly excel them in their Pa&s;tor. For I e&s;teem a good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t, an Evangeli&s;t, if compa|red with any of the re&s;t. The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> I believe, next to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> are more numerous than any Nation of the <HI>Francks;</HI> and take no more care, as I could learn, of their Religious Wor&s;hip. But as to Trade, none &s;trive to out-vie each other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRADE.</NOTE> &s;o much as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hol|lander;</HI> whereof <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Aleppo</HI> are now the chief Places, in the <HI>Levant.</HI> The Trade was formerly pretty well divided between them; but &s;ince their War with the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have much the grea|ter part of it.

The <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Factory con&s;i&s;t of four&s;core, or an hundred Per&s;ons, mo&s;t of them younger Sons to Gentlemen; who give three or four hundred pounds to &s;ome great Merchant of the <HI>Levant</HI> Company; and bind their Sons Apprentices for &s;even Years; three whereof they &s;erve at <HI>London,</HI> to under&s;tand their Ma&s;ters Concerns: and then their Ma&s;ters are obliged to &s;end them to negotiate in the&s;e Parts, and to find them bu&s;ine&s;s; out of which they are allowed a certain Sum, <HI>per Cent.:</HI> Where by their Indu&s;try, in Traffick for them&s;elves al&s;o, upon good Gains, but little Lo&s;s, they live gentilely, become rich, and get great E&s;tates in a &s;hort
<PB N="246" REF="90">time, if they will be but indifferent good Husbands, and careful of their Owners, and their own Bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have thirteen <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;everal Synagogues: All which makes the Town populous, though ill built, and without either Strength or Beauty.

As to the Ca&s;tle on the Hill above the Town, it is &s;lighted: and although it hath the old Wall about it, I believe, built by the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours; yet it is only a heap of Ruins within, with here and there &s;ome arched Caves, u&s;ed antiently for Ci|&s;terns or Granaries, as &s;ome think, having only two or three little Guns, mounted again&s;t the Haven, to &s;alute the Captain of the Gallies; or, as M^r <HI>Smith</HI> &s;aith, the New Moon at <HI>Bairam.</HI> About the Walls are &s;et one or two of the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles, well cut, and another <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-re|lievo</HI> of Men on Hor&s;e-back.

Ordinarily, when it &s;lept under a white woollen Cap, it would, when uncovered; be of a white, or cream|colour. But this it would do al&s;o, under a red Cap. I never &s;aw any change red, or blue, although they have been laid upon tho&s;e co|lours often, and continued there a long time. But upon green they would become green, and upon the dark Earth they would &s;oon change to that colour. One of the &s;ame bigne&s;s of which you &s;ee the Figure, I caught, as I was walking on the &s;ide of the Hill, near the old Ca&s;tle; where I &s;aw many, which had changed them&s;elves to the colour of the &s;peckled Stone-walls, to a grey with &s;pots, like Mo&s;s. This I found on the top of a green bu&s;h of <HI>Prunella Spino&s;a;</HI> which, when I fir&s;t ca&s;t my eye upon it, was of a bright, green colour; but as &s;oon as it per|ceived that I &s;aw it, it immediately let it &s;elf drop to the ground; and I as &s;oon &s;tooped to look for it, but could &s;ee nothing: yet continu|ing to look about earne&s;tly, at la&s;t I perceived it creeping away to a Hole in the Rock, being changed to a dark, brown colour, exactly like the Earth; which was then of that colour, after a &s;hower of Rain.</P>
<P>This changing of Colours is given to this Creature by Nature, for its Pre&s;ervation. For it is very &s;low in its pace, lifting up its Legs high, and not quick, as if they &s;aw not the way before them; or rather, as if they &s;earched for hold to climb up by; which they can do very well on an Herb, Tree, or Wall. When it &s;aw it &s;elf in danger to be caught, it opened its Mouth, and hi&s;&s;ed like a Snake. In a &s;mall time after I put it into my Handkerchief, it turned of the &s;ame co|lour, white, with &s;ome Spots, and a little tincture of red. This little one changed its colour more nimbly, than others that were greater. The cau&s;e of which I attribute to the wildne&s;s of it; the other, ha|ving been kept a good while before it was given us, and con&s;equently tamer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eyes</HI> are as wonderful as the <HI>Colours;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THE EYES.</NOTE> which are, as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> hath remarked, large in proportion to the bigne&s;s of its Head; being commonly bigger, and larger than a Pea. But that which &s;eems mo&s;t ob&s;ervable, his Lord&s;hip hath taken no notice of It is covered all over with a thick Skin, of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with the Body, the Grain being in circles, ju&s;t to the center or middle; where there is a hole, no bigger than a &s;mall Pins-head, by which it receives Light: which mu&s;t make the Angle of its Vi&s;ion very acute.</P>
<P>The <HI>Head</HI> being immoveable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE HEAD.</NOTE> it cannot turn it &s;elf to the Objects, as it li&s;teth. But, to malee amends for all &s;uch Inconveniences, Nature hath given mo&s;t wonderful Motions to its Eyes, beyond any other li|ving Creature. It can, not only move them, at the &s;ame time, both forward and backward, upward and downward; but al&s;o one forward, the other backward; the one upward, the other downward; the one fixed on one Object, and the other moving according to the motion of &s;ome other Object; and &s;o is capable of all the changes imaginable: which my Comrade and I often experimented with a great deal of A&s;to|ni&s;hment.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="91">
<P>The <HI>Tongue</HI> is a kind of little Trunk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE TONGUE.</NOTE> of a gri&s;tly Sub&s;tance, above half an inch long and hollow, joyned to his Throat by a &s;trong Mem|branous, and fle&s;hy Sub&s;tance; in which it is &s;heathed, when it is in the Mouth. It will dart this out of its Mouth above an Inch, being &s;meared with a glutinous Sub&s;tance, to catch Flies, which &s;tick fa&s;t to it, as to Bird-lime; and &s;o are brought into its Mouth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">FOOD.</NOTE> The&s;e Flies are their ordinary known Food; although I never &s;aw them catch a|ny: but &s;aw one, that was almo&s;t dead, having a Fly in its Mouth. The re&s;t of its Su&s;tenance is Air; of which it will fill it &s;elf, being &s;et out in the Sun, until it becometh much &s;wollen.</P>
<P>Of its Excrement I remarked nothing: But my Comrade telleth, That a Per&s;on of Curio&s;ity at <HI>Lyons,</HI> a&s;&s;ured him from his own Ob&s;ervations, That although the <HI>Camelion</HI> did eat little, or nothing; yet it neverthele&s;s made much Excrement. They will live without any Su&s;tenance, be&s;ides Air, a very great while; as will many other <HI>Animals,</HI> of the like cold Na|ture, <HI>viz. Serpents</HI> and <HI>Lizards,</HI> &amp;c. One that I opened, had Guts; but I per|ceived nothing in them: but the rea&s;on, I believe, was, becau&s;e it was even &s;tarved; having been kept a great while, and then almo&s;t dead.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Lungs</HI> reach near the length of its Body, con&s;i&s;ting of a thin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE LUNGS.</NOTE> skinny Sub&s;tance, full of &s;mall Veins, and divided into two <HI>Labels,</HI> placed on each &s;ide, and filled with Air; which being let out, tho&s;e <HI>Labels</HI> &s;hrunk together.</P>
<P>Its <HI>Tail</HI> is of very great u&s;e to it in climbing. It will twine it about a Bone, or a Stick &s;o fa&s;t, that if it let go,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE TAIL.</NOTE> or falls &s;hort in reaching at any thing el&s;e with its Claws, it will hang fa&s;t by the Tail, and &s;u&s;tain and recover its whole Body by it. The little one that I caught, I put it into a Gla&s;s, &s;o deep, that it could not reach the Brim with its Fore|feet by much, &s;lor could take any hold with its Claws; and yet it got it &s;elf out, and almo&s;t e&s;caped from me; as I &s;aw afterwards, by &s;tand|ing upon its Fore-feet, and hoi&s;ting it &s;elf up backwards, until it catched hold of the brim of the Gla&s;s with its Tail; by the help whereof, it lifted all its whole Body out.</P>
<P>And this is what I ob&s;erved of this wonderful <HI>Animal;</HI> which thus challengeth Prai&s;e for its Creator, the Lord of all Wonder.</P>
<P>Here are abundance of <HI>Pellicans;</HI> of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak another time. And my good Friend, M^r <HI>Ent,</HI> told me, That he ob&s;erved, that many Fowls, e&s;pecially <HI>Teal,</HI> have here a long Claw on their Wings, like the Spurs of a Cock. When I was in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> I had a <HI>Lapwing</HI> &s;hot, that had &s;o.</P>
<P>Here the Sheep are very large; but that which is extraordinary, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SHEEP.</NOTE> That they have a prodigious broad Tail, covering all the Rump; it being a meer lump of Fat on the Bones: And, I am &s;ure, I &s;peak with|in compa&s;s, they often weigh eight or ten pounds, if not more. This of Lambs, is e&s;teem'd as good as any Marrow; but of old Sheep, is no better than Tallow, and their Wool is cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Here I ob&s;erved in the Hedges a kind of <HI>Jujuba,</HI> like that I de&s;cri|bed at the Mouth of the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> as to its &s;ilver colour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS at SMYRNA.</NOTE> But the Sub&s;tance of the Wood of this, is more hard and knotty, of a dark, brown colour, like a Crab-tree; it hath here and there long and &s;harp Thorns, and the Leaves much larger and broader, than tho&s;e others. I do not find either this, or the other, de&s;cribed by <HI>Gerard:</HI> unle&s;s, perchance, the other narrow one be it, which he calleth <HI>Zizypha Cap|padociea.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Smyrnion</HI> groweth with here in great plenty; <HI>viz.</HI> that which we call <HI>Smyrnion Creticum,</HI> or <HI>Cardy-Alexanders:</HI> which the likene&s;s of the Name, makes the to believe, it took its Name rather from hence.</P>
<P>But an <HI>Origanum</HI> I found, growing plentifully in the Ca&s;tle, on the Hill, is a Plant I e&s;teem one of the mo&s;t curious I have gathered. It is a perennial Plant, &s;ending up long, woody Stalks, be&s;et with little Branches, at &s;everal di&s;tances, and Leaves &s;maller than the <HI>Candy-Majo|ram;</HI> not &s;o round, not white, but more long than broad, ending with a &s;harp point, ribbed, and a little downy. On the top is a Tu&s;t of &s;mall, &s;caly Seeds, like <HI>Dodder Gra&s;s;</HI> and the whole Plant of a mo&s;t fragrant Smell. Of this I brought a great deal of Seed, to furni&s;h our curious Gardens with; but without Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ships then in Port, bound to touch at <HI>Zant,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>England,</HI> being not ready to part for &s;ome days, we were re&s;olved to go vi|fit <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> which is not above a day and half's Journey South of <HI>Smyr|na.</HI> We hired Hor&s;es of an <HI>Armenian;</HI> who &s;erved both for our Guide and Interpreter: And for our Janizary, by the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s Recommenda|tion, we took one by the way, at <HI>Jamoura&s;i,</HI> a plea&s;ant Village, about fifteen Miles from <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, <HI>October</HI> the Fourth, we &s;et out from <HI>Smyrna;</HI> and fir&s;t, going out of the Town, we pa&s;&s;ed a little River behind the Ca&s;tle, running into the <HI>Meles;</HI> whence mounting a &s;teep Hill, it gave us the Pro|&s;pect of a plea&s;ant Plain, South-ward, bounded on the We&s;t with the Mountains, di&s;tingui&s;hed in old times by the Names of <HI>Corycus</HI> and <HI>Coricius,</HI> unto the Gulph of <HI>Colophon.</HI> They are well &s;tored with Hogs, and other Cha&s;e. Through this Plain we pa&s;&s;ed, leaving <HI>Sediqui</HI> a little on the left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JEMOURASI.</NOTE> about half way to <HI>Jemoura&s;i;</HI> where we lay that Evening, and were carried by our <HI>Janizary</HI> hence, to &s;ee the Governour; who hath a pretty convenient Seat, according to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mode, and entertain'd us civilly. The little Mo&s;ques, and Sepulchers here, are ve|ry prettily adorned with Cypre&s;s-Trees about them. From hence there is a &s;treight way over the Mountain, called by the <HI>Turks</HI> the <HI>Aleman;</HI> and much the neare&s;t way of the three, leading to <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> But our Janizary a&s;&s;ured us, That there were Robbers then abroad; and that it was much the &s;ecure&s;t, to go the Ea&s;tern-way, although it was more about, than either that by the Sea, or that over the Mountain. For this way, keeping &s;till the Plain, they could not have the Advan|tage of &s;etting on us unawares, nor at a di&s;advantage, if we did meet with them: and, in a word, that otherways he would not venture with us. We therefore took his advice, and went the left hand way, par|ting thence early in the Morning, <HI>October</HI> the fifth.</P>
<P>In about an hour and half we pa&s;&s;ed a little Stream, which in times pa&s;t was, as is believed, the River <HI>Halys,</HI> that runs to <HI>Colophon,</HI> and emp|tieth it &s;elf in that Bay; which &s;ometimes, upon the advantage of ground, I could di&s;cern between the Mountains: but perceived no &s;uch extraordinary Coldne&s;s in the Water, as the antient Report of this <HI>Halys.</HI> Further on the Plain we pa&s;&s;ed over four Streams more; which &s;een to go the &s;ame way: but coming nearer to the Foot of the <HI>Aleman,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by the Ruins of an <HI>Aqueduct,</HI> that cometh thence, and goeth &s;treight down to a Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TOURBALI.</NOTE> called <HI>Tourbali,</HI> a Mile or two thence on
<PB N="251" REF="92">the left hand, down over the Plain: Which hath been thought of &s;ome to be the City <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Ionia.</HI> We kept &s;till under this Mountain, on the right hand of us, and &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed over a paved way, and through Woods; in which I ob&s;erved many great <HI>Turpentine</HI> Trees, as big as A&s;hes or Oaks with us; and upon the brow of the Mountain, and down to the Plain, whole Woods of <HI>Olive</HI> Trees growing wild. I could &s;ee no difference betwen theem, and the Garden-Olives of <HI>Lu|ca:</HI> They bear more Olives, than the Inhabitants are able to gather to make Oyl of. About noon we came to a large Burying-Place of the <HI>Turks;</HI> having abundance of broken Pillars, and other Marble Stones, placed in the ground for Grave-Stones. There we alighted to bait under a curious large Ma&s;tick Tree, which hung full of drops of <HI>Tur|pentine;</HI> which made me believe, That it was only want of Indu&s;try, that they made not as much profit of it on the main Land, as in the I&s;le of <HI>Scio:</HI> which hath monopolized all the Glory and Profit of that excellent Juyce.</P>
<P>But my Comrade and I were &s;oon ran&s;acking tho&s;e Stones, to &s;ee if from them we could learn any more, than from the more &s;tupid People of the&s;e parts. But we found only one Stone, engraven with Letters little to our purpo&s;e: Yet looking &s;till about, over the Hedge, ju&s;t by, we &s;aw many Ruins, Caves, and Walls; which made us think,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CABAGEA, or METROPO|LIS.</NOTE> that this might be the City <HI>Metropolis,</HI> it being not far above Mid|way from <HI>Smyrna;</HI> upon that which was the Military way, as the Pavement in many places, yet remaining, a&s;&s;ures us; and in effect, our <HI>Armenian,</HI> when we told him our Thoughts, <HI>viz.</HI> That there had been a City there, did likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ure us, That tho&s;e of <HI>Cabagea,</HI> about a Mile thence, on the brow of the Hill, told him, That there had been a City there; and that the word <HI>Cabagea</HI> &s;ignified a <HI>Great City,</HI> and belong|ed properly to this Place: though the Village, called <HI>Cabagea,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts now only of fifteen, or twenty Hou&s;es; yet it &s;till continues the Name of the City, as being near to the Ruins of it. And probably, it is not long &s;ince this Town, or City, hath been de&s;troyed. For hereabouts are four or five great Burying-places of the <HI>Turks;</HI> which argues, That in times pa&s;t, tho&s;e places have not been &s;o depopulated, as now they are. All this, with the direction we took from <HI>Strabo,</HI> we put toge|ther, and concluded, That here &s;tood the City <HI>Metropolis,</HI> in antient times. It hath from the brow of the Mountain, at the foot of which it is &s;ituated, a good Pro&s;pect over the Plain, North and Ea&s;t. But I am not of my Comrade's opinion, That this Mountain, now called the <HI>Aleman,</HI> was called <HI>Mimas</HI> in old time: but that it is rather the <HI>Galle|cius mons,</HI> which <HI>Strabo</HI> puts between <HI>Colophon</HI> and <HI>Ephe&s;us:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>13.</HI></NOTE> but pla|ces <HI>Mons Mimas,</HI> near <HI>Erythraea,</HI> in the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;us</HI> by <HI>Smyrna,</HI> after <HI>Mons Corycus</HI> and <HI>Coracius,</HI> by <HI>Argennum Promontorium;</HI> and is now called <HI>The Brothers,</HI> entring the Gulph of <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>Two or three Miles further, through a de&s;olate Wood, we came to the River <HI>Cai&s;ter;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAISTER. <HI>Fluv.</HI></NOTE> hard by which we &s;aw &s;ix Hor&s;e-men coming down from the Mountain, cro&s;&s;ing the Road to way-lay us; and as &s;oon as they came to the way, they &s;topped, and ranged all on one &s;ide of the way. Our Janizary rid fore-mo&s;t up to them, and talked a little with them: In the mean time I endeavoured to pa&s;s by at a di&s;tance;
<PB N="252" REF="93">which the furthermo&s;t perceiving, went &s;till along with me. But I kept my hand on the Cock of my Carabine; and my Comrade fol|lowed a foot pace, as well armed; and our Janizary better than either of us both: but our <HI>Armenian</HI> had only a Scimeter. After a little di&s;cour&s;e they all gabbled in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language together, wi&s;hing us a good Journey, and away they went another way. Our Janizary told us, That they asked him, what we were, and whither we were going? and he told them, That we had nothing with us worth their taking, That we were his Friends, and going only to take the Air. They an|&s;wered, So were they; and forthwith marched from us. He that look|ed like their Chief, was an <HI>Arab,</HI> a large timber'd, tall Fellow, with a <HI>Saracen</HI>'s Head. They were al&s;o well arm'd with Swords, Darts, Bows, and Spears: but I perceiv'd no Fire-Arms they had; which might be the great rea&s;on they did not &s;et on us, &s;eeing us &s;o well fitted. For I be|lieve, they were &s;uch as u&s;ed to pillage poor Hou&s;es, and Villages, not able to make re&s;i&s;tance. We were told at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> That they were but part of Eighteen; who thus had divided them&s;elves in three ways, from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Ephe&s;us: viz.</HI> Six by the Sea, near <HI>Scala Nova;</HI> Six on the Mountains, and Six this way. Our Janizary pretended Acquain|tance with them, and that his Father had been formerly one of them; and that for his &s;ake they let us alone. But whatever the in&s;trumental Means was, my Comrade and I concluded, That it was the Merciful Hand of God towards us; and therefore to Him, as it was mo&s;t ju&s;t, we gave the Prai&s;e; who never faileth tho&s;e, that put their Tru&s;t in Him.</P>
<P>Not far from hence we began to turn the Promontory of the Moun|tain, if I may &s;o call it; upon who&s;e high Clifts I &s;aw the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, and lo&s;t the River <HI>Cai&s;ter,</HI> until we came to a narrow Valley between two Mountains; where again we recovered the River, and pa&s;&s;ed it over by a Stone-Bridge, about a couple of Miles from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> where we arrived a little before it was dark.</P>

<P><HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> is built in a fine Plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EPHESUS.</NOTE> &s;tretched in length We&s;t-ward to the Sea, I believe four or five Miles; and may be, in many places, two at lea&s;t broad; &s;o encompa&s;&s;ed about with high Mountains, and rocky Clifts on the North, Ea&s;t, and South &s;ides, in &s;o ju&s;t a proportion, that I can fan&s;ie it re&s;embleth nothing more, than the <HI>Cirques,</HI> and the <HI>Sta|diums</HI> of the Antients. It hath the Mountain <HI>Gallecius</HI> on the North|&s;ide, from the Sea to the Pa&s;&s;age, through which the River <HI>Cai&s;ter</HI> runs. Parallel to that, South, it hath the Mountain <HI>Corre&s;ius,</HI> if I gue&s;s right, out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> running from We&s;t to Ea&s;t; and thence, bend|ing up circular, fortifieth the Ea&s;t &s;ide as well as the South. The Ri|ver <HI>Cai&s;ter</HI> runneth through it, entring the Pa&s;&s;age between the Moun|tains, and leaving the City South of it, after various windings and turn|ings through the Plain, mixeth it &s;elf with the Sea, near the We&s;tern Promontory of the South Mountain. For the City was built on the South &s;ide the River, principally upon two Rocks, about half a Mile from each other. The fir&s;t is near the Ea&s;t end of the Plain; where|on the Ca&s;tle now &s;tandeth, guarded by the <HI>Turks:</HI> which &s;eemeth to be of no older date, than the later <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours; being built of other more antient Ruins, as the Fragments of more curious pieces of Marble, carele&s;ly mixed among the other Stones, a&s;&s;ured us. Over the Gate of it are &s;et three large Tables of Marble, carved in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o|relievo.</HI> The fir&s;t is quite defaced, the middle one is of excellent Work. The fir&s;t Figure of it is a Hor&s;e, with a Man lying under his feet; who &s;eemeth to have an antient <HI>Armenian</HI> Bonnet on his Head. A little further is another Figure, holding the foot of the fir&s;t Man, &s;eeming to drag him along. The next is a Woman in an humble Po&s;ture, demanding &s;omewhat of another Figure, &s;tanding in a <HI>Roman</HI> Habit; &s;o that it &s;eems
<PB N="254" REF="94">to be &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Triumph: but what, it is uncertain. Some have thought it to repre&s;ent the De&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and <HI>Hector</HI> drawn by the Chariot of <HI>Achilles;</HI> but no Chariot is there to be &s;een. Others, That it repre&s;ented the Per&s;ecution of the Primitive Chri&s;tians under the <HI>Romans,</HI> with le&s;s probability.

From one of them we could only learn the erecting of an Image to the Godde&s;s <HI>Diana,</HI> as the whole City was filled with her &s;uper&s;titious Wor&s;hip: And on the right hand of the way, we left the ruins of an Aqueduct, coming from the Ea&s;tern-hills to the Ca&s;tle; which, as I under&s;tood by tho&s;e that gave it me, had this In&s;cription on it in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek;</HI> which was its Dedication to the Honour of <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and <HI>Tiberius, Cae&s;ars,</HI> and to the City of <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>But my Companion mentions it about &s;ix Miles off, on an Aqueduct near <HI>Scala Nova;</HI> but undoubtedly he is mi&s;taken; for the In&s;cription it &s;elf, although not well copied, proveth it &s;o: For, not knowing of any In&s;cription on it, until we returned, we contented our &s;elves with
<PB N="255" REF="94">a view of it at a di&s;tance. But it being both in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> com|paring them together, I have found the Errours of both, and re&s;tored it thus:

<P>The whole Face of the Earth about them, is covered with Ruins, fragment of Marble, Pede&s;tals, Pillars, and all parts of mo&s;t antient, and noble &s;tructure; now broken, maim'd, and di&s;united. I &s;aw in the Street an In&s;cription almo&s;t defaced, upon a Marble Sepul|cher.</P>
<P>But that which mo&s;t of all was the Object of our Curio&s;ity in this part of the Town, was the Church of S^t <HI>John</HI> the Evan|geli&s;t, which we de&s;ired to &s;ee, and with much ado obtain'd of the &s;crupulous Keeper, for half a Dollar, for my &s;elf, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing for my Scrivan or Clerk; which he might then ea&s;ily do, ha|ving his Pen and Ink in his Hand: and for this Device we were be|holding to our <HI>Armenian.</HI> This Church is now &s;acrilegiou&s;ly tur|ned into a <HI>Mahumetan Mo&s;que.</HI> It &s;tands on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, and is no extraordinary Edifice. It hath a Court on the North-&s;ide, and is a long Building, &s;tanding Ea&s;t and We&s;t, covered with a double Roof, leaded, and &s;u&s;tained in the middle with three Pillars of Granate Marble, mo&s;t admirably well poli&s;hed; one of which is twelve Foot, and eleven Inches in compa&s;s, with a white Marble Capital of the <HI>Com|pound Order.</HI> The other two want not much of this; but their Ca|pitals are of the ill-favour'd modern <HI>Greek</HI> fa&s;hion. Their Pede&s;tals are not &s;een; &s;o they may be further in the Ground, than is imagined. On each Roof there is a little ill-proportioned <HI>Cuppalo;</HI> and in the Court another Capital of the <HI>Compound Order,</HI> with &s;ome broken pieces of Pillars; which might have made a Cloy&s;ter about it in times pa&s;t.</P>
<PB N="257" REF="95">
<P>Thence we took Hor&s;e, to &s;ee the other Rocky Hill, half a Mile South-wards; where, probably, was the greate&s;t part of the City, be|ing near the Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth. On the Ea&s;tern top of which we di&s;covered Ruins, and were carried fir&s;t into a Cave under ground, about &s;ix or eight Foot <HI>Diameter.</HI> It is incru&s;ted above with Congelations, that make it a mo&s;t pretty <HI>Grotto.</HI> Hard by we &s;aw a circular Place in the Hill, made like a Theater; but now, in ef|fect, de&s;troyed. A little further North-wards, but &s;till on the Ea&s;t|&s;ide of the Rock, goeth in a place with Arches fallen down, with &s;ome Figures of a ruined Church; where they tell you, was the Cave of the <HI>Seven Sleepers;</HI> who in the Per&s;ecution, in the time of the Emperour <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> hiding them&s;elves in a Cave, fell a&s;leep, and awaked not till about Two hundred Years after; thinking they had &s;lept but one Night. One cannot believe, but they were &s;trangely a&s;toni&s;hed, when they found how the face of the City was changed, their Friends and Acquaintance all dead, their Money unknown, and not currant, and all People become Chri&s;tians. This Rock hath been curiou&s;ly car|ved at the Entrance, by the Piety of former Ages.</P>
<P>Going yet forwards under the &s;ame Hill, yet &s;till We&s;t-wards, we pa&s;t by many va&s;t Heaps of Ruins, now without form, or likene&s;s to any thing with a Name. Only one, which is known to be a <HI>Cirque,</HI> or <HI>Stadium,</HI> by its Figure and Length, and &s;eemeth to have had a kind of <HI>Theater</HI> at the end of it, being circular, and as it were &s;eparate from the re&s;t by a Wall: Whence two Walls run parallel a great length We&s;t-wards, with Arches underneath for Walks, and Wild Bea&s;ts. The Figure of which I took, becau&s;e I had not noted any like it be|fore.</P>
<P>Parallel to this is the Ruins of an <HI>Amphitheater,</HI> in view of the Tem|ple of <HI>Diana,</HI> and not very far from it; where, in all likelihood, all the Rabble of the City met together, to vindicate the Honour of their <HI>Godde&s;s Diana,</HI> of the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> upon the account of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the <HI>Silver-Smith,</HI> who made <HI>Silver-Shrines</HI> for Men to perform their Idola|trous Devotion to their great <HI>Godde&s;s,</HI> and <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Image,</HI> which, as they believ'd, <HI>fell down from Jupiter.</HI> It would be wi&s;hed, there were not &s;o many of &s;uch Crafts-men in the&s;e times; by who&s;e means Super&s;ti|tion is &s;o much promoted. A little further, under the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Hill, is a Marble-Arch; which I gue&s;s was the Front of a Chri&s;tian Church, built out of the Ruins of &s;ome more antient Edifice: its Walls being full of Fragments of In&s;criptions, and other carved Stones, joyn|ed to the re&s;t, without any regard to their former &s;tate. Some are well pre&s;erved; but were too high for us to make any thing of them, without a Ladder; which, I hope, will be done by the next, that &s;hall have the Curio&s;ity to vi&s;it this Place.</P>
<P>Yet a little further South-We&s;t, is a great <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> of a mixed Marble, of Red and White. Some call it <HI>Porphyry;</HI> but I rather, with Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Spon,</HI> believe it to be <HI>Ja&s;per:</HI> but doubt, whether it is more than an ordinary mixed Marble. <HI>Porphyry</HI> is a very hard red Stone, &s;peck|led
<PB N="258" REF="96">with &s;mall white Spots; but the mixture of this is in veins, and not hard enough for either <HI>Porphyry</HI> or <HI>Ja&s;per.</HI> It is fifteen Foot <HI>Diame|ter;</HI> and is thought to be the Font S^t <HI>John</HI> baptized in, when he was at <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> But I hardly think it con&s;i&s;tent with the private Exerci&s;e of Chri&s;tian Religion in tho&s;e times. It was all of one Stone; but hath now many pieces broken off. Hard by this are the Ruins of a little round Temple; and about a Bow-&s;hot further we were conducted to a great heap of Ruins, &s;uppo&s;ed to be that famous Temple of <HI>Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.</HI> Of what Figure her Temple was, I know not: But I am not of opinion, That the&s;e Ruins were of that &s;hape Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> &s;peaketh of; <HI>viz.</HI> That the length was double the breadth; nor that the Front was towards the Ea&s;t, but the We&s;t; which I ob&s;erved from the top of a Wall I climbed up to. For there is a heap of curious Marble before it, at that end; which &s;eemed to have been a <HI>Portico,</HI> and to which the Arches more inward &s;eem to concur: And &s;till ob|&s;erving about me, I fan&s;ied, that I &s;aw the &s;ame &s;hape with that I de|&s;cribed at <HI>Troy,</HI> or <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with a Court We&s;t-ward; where are per|ceivable, and as I there marked upon Paper, the Pede&s;tals of Pillars; as if there had been other <HI>Portico</HI>'s, on each hand oppo&s;ite to one ano|ther. There are Foundations of Walls al&s;o Ea&s;t-ward, for Gardens and Conveniences of the Building, as M^r <HI>Smith</HI> al&s;o hath ob&s;erved: who believeth, That it hath been a Chri&s;tian Church; but built out of the Ruins, and upon the Foundations of that Temple. But nothing of ve|ry great certainty can now be reported from this rude heap; only that here was the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> once built, as the va&s;t proportion of the Pillars, that lie towards the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and the nearne&s;s to the Lake <HI>Selenu&s;ia,</HI> which was dedicated to <HI>Diana,</HI> and lieth near the River, on the North-We&s;t of the Building, demon&s;trate.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> telleth al&s;o, That <HI>Cheiromocrates</HI> was the Architect of this Tem|ple, and the &s;ame that built that at <HI>Alexandria.</HI> If he mean that <HI>A|lexandria</HI> near <HI>Troy,</HI> as in all likelihood he doth; I know not why he might not be the Architect of that Temple, I before de&s;cribed there. And indeed, their Form &s;o well re&s;embling one another, and the pieces of Arches that remain, con&s;i&s;ting of Brick and Stone, that &s;eem to have been covered within with &s;ome Metal, by the Holes which yet remain orderly in rowes for &s;ome &s;uch purpo&s;e, a&s;&s;uring me, That the Building is not modern, incline me much to be of opinion, That both are the Remains of the Temples of <HI>Diana.</HI> The Foundations of this Temple have worthily been e&s;teemed a Labyrinth, from the many turnings, and windings, with great and little Arches in rowes: But whether it were de&s;igned for one or no, matters not; it being but nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;uch a Foundation, to &s;o va&s;t a Pile of Building, in &s;o wet and moo|ri&s;h a Place. We went down to it by a long Pack-thred, tied to the Hole where we fir&s;t entred; and with all the Light our Candles had, we made no great Di&s;coveries: But when wearied with the thick Va|pours of the Place, we returned to the fre&s;h Air. Thence we rid a quarter of a Mile further We&s;t, to a little Hill, on which is a Building of white Marble, called <HI>Saint Paul</HI>'s <HI>Pri&s;on.</HI> I confe&s;s, the Building is &s;trong enough for the Name, con&s;i&s;ting of good thick Walls of well-hewen Marble, and undoubtedly very antient: It is divided into four
<PB N="259" REF="96">Rooms, and hath but one Entrance: But the Convenience of the Place &s;eems rather to argue, that it was made for a Watch-Tower, than for a Pri&s;on. For it hath a Pro&s;pect over the whole Plain; which thence, with great delight, I viewed, and ob&s;erved the City lying Ea&s;t-wards, the Sea We&s;t-ward; and the River <HI>Cai&s;ter,</HI> doubling it &s;elf into &s;o ma|ny Snaky Po&s;tures over the whole Plain, that it hath made &s;ome con|clude it to be the <HI>Meander,</HI> who had never &s;een the true one in <HI>Ca|ria.</HI> Hence I di&s;covered al&s;o another &s;mall Lake on the Northern-&s;ide of the Plain, and of the River, with &s;ome little Hills near it: And, to conclude, here I ob&s;erved the Situation of all I have hitherto de&s;cri|bed; and with great plea&s;ure, marked them on a Paper; from which I have transferred them to your view.</P>
<P>That this River is the <HI>Cai&s;ter,</HI> is evident by all antient Te&s;timony, which the Money of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> confirmeth; whereof in &s;everal Medals I have &s;een of the Emperours <HI>Valerianus, Gallienus,</HI> and <HI>Salonina,</HI> with two we bought at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> one of which I have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE> and the other Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> re&s;erveth; are the&s;e Letters on the Rever&s;e,

<P>But now I am &s;peaking of Medals, it will not be ami&s;s to give you an account of &s;ome others that we &s;aw, and have, concerning this Place. On &s;ome we find, that this City was &s;tiled <HI>The Chief City of A&s;ia,</HI>

It is of the Emperour <HI>Septimius Severus;</HI> the Rever&s;e whereof hath a &s;edent Figure, holding another Figure, &s;tanding up right in his hand, made ju&s;t like many antient Images I have &s;een at <HI>Rome,</HI> full of Dugs; which the Antiquaries call <HI>Dea Mammea,</HI> the <HI>Godde&s;s with Dugs:</HI> and the&s;e Letters are about it, &Zgr;&Egr;&Ugr;&Slungr; &Agr;&Kgr;&Rgr;&Egr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Slungr; &Pgr;&Rgr;&OHgr;&Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Agr;&Slungr;&Igr;&Agr;&Slungr; &Egr;&PHgr;&Egr;&Slungr;&Igr;&OHgr;&Ngr;,

<P>When I had &s;een, and con&s;idered all this De&s;olation, How could I chu&s;e but lament the Ruin of this Glorious Church!

<PB N="260" REF="97">and do daily fall from bad to wor&s;e: That God is a God of <HI>purer Eyes,</HI> than <HI>to behold Iniquity;</HI> and &s;eeing the <HI>Axe</HI> thus long &s;ince <HI>put to the Root of the Tree,</HI> Should it not make us repent, and turn to God, <HI>le&s;t we likewi&s;e peri&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>We did intend in our Return over the Mountain, to have &s;een the Pa&s;|&s;age S^t <HI>Paul</HI> cut with his Sword, as the hone&s;t Pea&s;ants tell: But we had &s;pent &s;o much time here, that we were afraid of lo&s;ing the way, and being benighted on the Mountain among tho&s;e Robbers that had be&s;et all the ways. So we returned the &s;ame way we came; and left <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> about Noon, <HI>Octob.</HI> 6. after little more than a Night, and half a Days &s;tay there. I remarked both coming and returning, that the Brow of the Mountains were covered with Olive-Trees; that the <HI>E|phe&s;ian</HI> Plain had much <HI>Tamerisk</HI> growing about it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> and by the Ca&s;tle I ob&s;erved &s;everal great Orchards of Apricock-Trees; and among the Ruins in the Ca&s;tle I &s;aw much <HI>Ricinus;</HI> whereof I gathered a good quan|tity of Seeds. Upon the Hill, whereon &s;tandeth <HI>Saint Paul</HI>'s Pri&s;on, I &s;ound a Tree-Frog; whereof I will &s;peak more at large hereafter; as al&s;o of a &s;ort of <HI>Arbutus,</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Comarea,</HI> with others at <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>Before we came to the <HI>Ionian</HI> Plains, we repented of our coming from <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> that day. For it began to be dark; and our <HI>Janizary,</HI> to avoid meeting Thieves, left the common Road, and led us &s;uch a private way, that he at la&s;t lo&s;t us in the Dark: and it began to thun|der, lighten, and rain, as if Heaven and Earth would di&s;&s;olve: And, at la&s;t, we were gotten into &s;uch low Grounds, among the Moors, that we &s;prang Ducks, and Snipes, and were in danger, every minute, to have our Hor&s;es laid fa&s;t. We lighted our Candle, and put it in a Lanthorn we carried with us; and looked up and down an hour or two for the way: but found it not. At la&s;t we came to a little Hil|lock of dry Ground, covered with Bu&s;hes; of which, with much ado, we made a Fire, and comforted our &s;elves as well as we could, with a Bottle of <HI>Smyrna</HI> Wine. But we pitied our poor <HI>Janizary,</HI> that would drink no Wine with us; not had we any Water for him: Yet he bore the ill Accident with greater Patience, than is ordinary among &s;uch People. We u&s;ed all the Arguments we could, to per&s;wade him. My Comrade, as a Phy&s;ician, advi&s;eth him; but all in vain. He &s;aid, <HI>If he &s;hould be &s;ick, God &s;hould be his Phy&s;ician.</HI> But this was not for fear of breaking his Law, as we under&s;tood afterwards; but by rea&s;on of a particular Vow he had made; which was upon this occa&s;ion: He u&s;ed always to have his Cellar well &s;tored with the be&s;t Wine of the Country; of which he u&s;ed to drink plentifully him&s;elf, and enter|tain the <HI>Turks</HI> his Friends. But particularly once, Three of his Acquain|tance came to &s;ee him; whom he re&s;olving to make merry, carried in|to his Cellar, to make choice of the Wine they liked be&s;t: Of which, when they grew merry, they began to talk of a pretty Young Maid in the Village: I of whom they di&s;cour&s;ed, and drunk &s;o long, till they became &s;o valiant, at la&s;t, as to re&s;olve to go, and try her Vertue: which they executed, notwith&s;tanding all the Re&s;i&s;tance the Hou&s;e could make, and brake into the Maid's Apartment: who re&s;i&s;ting their fair Words, they began to u&s;e violence; which &s;he finding, &s;uddenly &s;natch|ed
<PB N="261" REF="97">a Ponyard from the &s;ide of one of them, and &s;tabbed him to the Heart; which the re&s;t perceiving, fled. But the Maid, not yet &s;ati&s;|fied for the Di&s;honour done her, went, and complained to the <HI>Caddi;</HI> who finding it done in a drunken Fit, had the re&s;t well ba&s;tinadoed. For this Di&s;grace our <HI>Janizary</HI> went pre&s;ently to revenge him&s;elf on the poor Wine they had &s;o abu&s;ed; and knockt out all the heads of his Ve&s;&s;els: making a &s;olemn Vow, That he would never drink Wine more.</P>
<P>Here we were alarm'd with the Noi&s;e of the <HI>Chacals,</HI> an Animal of the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Fox,</HI> which are here in great numbers. Once in an hour they would begin to howl; and as &s;oon as one began, the whole Plain round about was filled with the Noi&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Next Morning we went to <HI>Sedjaqui</HI> to dinner, which is a Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SEDJAQUI.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of Merchants Country-Hou&s;es, adorn'd with Gardens and Or|chards; to which they come to take the fre&s;h Air, and to cour&s;e and hunt with their Grey-Hounds and Beagles; of which they always keep a good Pack. Here we were kindly entertain'd at D^r <HI>Pickering</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and return'd the &s;ame Evening to <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>We had a great de&s;ire to have &s;een many other Places in the&s;e Parts, e&s;pecially the re&s;t of the <HI>Seven Churches,</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e:</HI> But the time of the Year being pa&s;t for &s;uch Expeditions, the great Rains beginning to fall, and the Waters being up in mo&s;t of the Plains, be&s;ides other Ri&s;ques we were to expect; we contented our &s;elves with the Information we received of the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> and other ingenious Mer|chants there, who had made tho&s;e Journeys, and very freely let us par|take of the Plea&s;ure of their Travels, without the Pains.</P>
<P>But pardon me, O Heavens! Do I call that <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> which is a Sub|ject fit only for a <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to lament over?

But they had tho&s;e among them, that taught them to <HI>Eat things offe|red to Idols,</HI> and to <HI>commit Fornication.</HI> They had tho&s;e, that held <HI>the Doctrine of the Nicolaites,</HI> hated by Him. Of all which he exhor|teth them to repent: otherwi&s;e He would <HI>come quickly,</HI> and <HI>fight a|gain&s;t them with the Sword of His Mouth.</HI> This Church now is reduced to a very low condition. There is not in the whole Town above a dozen or fifteen Families of mi&s;erable Chri&s;tians, that till the Ground to gain their Bread. They have but one Church left, dedicated to S^t <HI>Theodorus,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Smyrna;</HI> under which Bi&s;hoprick they are re|duced.

<PB N="263" REF="98">writ
&Pgr;&Egr;&Rgr;&Ggr;&Agr;&Mgr;&Egr;&Ngr;&OHgr;&Ngr;,
<HI>Of Pergamus.</HI> The Figure of which you may view, and proceed to con&s;ider, how he that hath the <HI>Seven Spirits of God,</HI> and the <HI>Seven Stars,</HI> reproacheth them of <HI>Sardis.</HI> Apoc. 3.1, 2, &amp;c. <HI>I know thy Works.

If therefore thou &s;halt not watch, I will come on thee as a Thief; and thou &s;halt not know, what Hour I come upon thee. Thou ha&s;t a few Names even in</HI> Sardis, <HI>who have not defiled their Garments; and they &s;hall walk with me in White; for they are worthy.

<P>And now &s;ee, how it fareth with this mi&s;erable Church, thus mark|ed out by God; who being reduced to a very incon&s;iderable number, live by the Sweat of their Brows, in digging and planting the Gardens of the <HI>Turks</HI> they live among&s;t, and &s;erve; having neither Church nor Prie&s;t among them.

<P>Thus is that once Glorious City of the rich King <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> now redu|ced to a Ne&s;t of wor&s;e than Beggars.

Yet there are &s;ome Remains of noble Structures, Remembran|cers of their pro&s;perous State, long &s;ince de&s;troyed. For at the Ea&s;t|&s;ide of the City, are the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle, and of a great Church, and North, and South, Palaces, and other proud Buildings, humbled at pre&s;ent to the Earth.</P>

<P>Whence, I judge, the antient Name of this Place was <HI>Panionium.</HI> That which confirms me in this opinion, is the Situation <HI>Strabo</HI> gives to the <HI>Panionium,</HI> on this &s;ide of the Mountain <HI>Mycale,</HI> about a quarter of a Mile from the Sea: For &s;o is the Situation of <HI>Changlee.</HI> This <HI>Panionion</HI> was the Place, where all the&s;e thirteen Cities of <HI>Ionia</HI> met, to con&s;ult a|bout their common Affairs.</P>
<P>The next day, about four in the Morning, they &s;et out; and having gained the top of the Mountain <HI>Mycale,</HI> with &s;ome difficulty, although it be plea&s;ant by rea&s;on of the cool Shades, made by &s;everal &s;orts of Trees, as <HI>Che&s;nut</HI>-Trees, and very tall <HI>Pines,</HI> and fre&s;h Springs, i&s;&s;uing plentifully out of the &s;ides of it, they had very large Pro&s;pects about them, North and We&s;t-wards <HI>Ionia,</HI> and the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea, towards the South, the Plains of <HI>Caria,</HI> to the Mountain <HI>Latmus,</HI> with the curious Windings and Turnings of the River <HI>Meander;</HI> which M^r <HI>Salter,</HI> an in|genious Merchant of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> de&s;igned, and among other Draughts obliged me with a Copy of this. The De&s;cent was very difficult; the Moun|tain being nothing but a Rock of very clear Marble, altogether un|&s;hadowed by Trees. But in two Hours time they came into the Plain, through a narrow way, having left behind them the Remains of a Ca&s;tle Ea&s;t-ward.</P>
<P>At the Foot of this Hill is a Village, called <HI>San&s;on;</HI> where are &s;ome Ruins, and a Pillar, with a defaced In&s;cription they could not take.

<P>They were after carried to the Ruins of an old <HI>Greek Church,</HI> as the People &s;ay it hath been: under which is a very fair arched Place; where the People now &s;alt their Fi&s;h, after they have taken out the Rows, whereof they make <HI>Botargoes:</HI> the mo&s;t they catch being very large <HI>Mullets.</HI> Upon this arched Place is a Foundation of very fair Marble, of divers colours.

<P>About five in the Afternoon they parted from <HI>Palat&s;ha,</HI> and about two hours after came to a <HI>Greek</HI> Village, where they lay; from whence two hours more in the Morning, brought them to the bottom of a Bay, which they call the <HI>Gulph of Samos;</HI> perhaps formerly <HI>Latmicus Sinus:</HI> going on &s;till by the Sea-&s;ide, they found the Ruins of a va&s;t Structure, called by the <HI>Turks, Jotan.</HI> D^r <HI>Pickering</HI> was of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JOTAN.</NOTE> That it was the Sepulcher of <HI>Mau&s;olus,</HI> built by <HI>Artemi&s;ia</HI> to the Ho|nour of her Husband at <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us,</HI> and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. For it is yet mo&s;t &s;plendid in its va&s;t Ruins, built of white Marble, and adorned with Pillars of all Orders; of which two only were entire of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Order, with an Architrave on them. But I believe the Doctor was &s;hort a great way, in his Conjecture of that <HI>Mau&s;olum,</HI> as will appear further. I &s;uppo&s;e it to be only the Ruins
<PB N="272" REF="104">of &s;ome <HI>Theater,</HI> by the Draught they gave me of it. But upon better Examination, I rather believe it to have been the Temple and Oracle of <HI>Didymeus Apollo</HI> at <HI>Branchida;</HI> which being burnt by <HI>Xerxes,</HI> as all the re&s;t be&s;ides the <HI>Ephe&s;ium,</HI> the <HI>Mile&s;ians</HI> again rebuilt it the bigge&s;t of all others, letting it remain uncovered by rea&s;on of its va&s;t Great|ne&s;s; for it was as big as a Town in circumference, having a mo&s;t excellent Grove within and without. This was eighteen <HI>Stadia</HI> from <HI>Po&s;idium prom.</HI> of the <HI>Mile&s;ians,</HI> and not far either by Land or Sea to the City, meaning <HI>Miletum;</HI> which he next falls a de&s;cribing by name: Then follows <HI>Latmicus Sinus,</HI> and therein <HI>Heraclea,</HI> under the Mountain <HI>Latmus.</HI></P>
<P>Thence, from &s;even in the Morning until five Afternoon, they pa&s;|&s;ed over a very bad Mountainous way: whence may be learnt, if compared with <HI>Strabo,</HI> that that Mountain is the <HI>Latmus</HI> of the Anti|ents; and if &s;o, the Bay above-mentioned mu&s;t, as I &s;aid, be <HI>Sinus Latmi|cus:</HI> which if true, that place of Ruins, called now <HI>Jotan,</HI> &s;hould be <HI>He|raclea,</HI> called before that time <HI>Latmus,</HI> from the Mountain about it: which if &s;o, that which my Companion hath judged to be <HI>Maletum,</HI> will be no other than <HI>Pyrrha;</HI> or <HI>Strabo</HI> hath not acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well as he pretended to do: So that we &s;hall be yet to &s;eek for <HI>Miletum;</HI> un|le&s;s the Place, where they re&s;ted this Morning, or &s;ome where there|abouts, was it: For here were Ruins al&s;o, and &s;ome In&s;criptions among them.</P>
<P>Near a Fountain where they lodged was one, which they de&s;crib'd to be a Stone, hollowed by the People to beat Corn in; and is carved on one &s;ide with a Man on Hor&s;eback, and a Serpent under the Hor&s;e Feet; having on the other &s;ide an In&s;cription, not &s;o well copied, that I can make any thing of it. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> thinks the Per&s;on, for who&s;e Monument it was erected, was of <HI>Miletum;</HI> for there is

But they relate no &s;uch great Matters of the Place, as that it &s;hould be equal with <HI>Ephe|&s;us,</HI> and thought one of the two be&s;t Cities of <HI>Ionia.</HI> But perhaps our Travellers might not &s;ee all the Ruins; or it may be, the greate&s;t part, and be&s;t of them, are by the various and potent Engines of Time, and Fate, now no more to be &s;een. Yet although this Place &s;eems to have lo&s;t it &s;elf, and we are &s;o uncertain where to find it, it was, in antient times, a Place of great Renown, both for the many Colonies they planted abroad; and al&s;o for the Birth of many <HI>Worthies,</HI> e&s;pecial|ly <HI>Thales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suidas.</NOTE> one of the Seven Wi&s;e-Men among the <HI>Grecians;</HI> and very worthily &s;o e&s;teemed: For it was he among the Heathen, that fir&s;t a&s;|&s;erted the Immortality of the Soul.</P>
<P>They re&s;ted <HI>Sunday,</HI> until &s;ix in the Evening: Then taking Hor&s;e, in three Hours time they pa&s;t over a Mountain, and came to a Place in the open Field, where was a Fountain, or Spring of fre&s;h Water; at which they re&s;ted till Morning, within &s;ight of the Sea.</P>

<P>The next day they pa&s;t over another very high Mountain, e&s;teem'd, by their Report, the highe&s;t of all <HI>Caria;</HI> and which, according to their de&s;ign of <HI>Vi&s;iting the Churches,</HI> I believe, mu&s;t be Mount <HI>Latmus</HI> again, and the &s;ame which, <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Myla&s;&s;a</HI> was built under. They had not travelled many Hours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISQUIHISSER</NOTE> before they came to a Town called <HI>I&s;|quihi&s;&s;er;</HI> where they found the Ruins of a great Temple, and Pillars, with In&s;criptions on them. This may be the City <HI>Stratonicaea;</HI> which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRATONI|CAEA.</NOTE> <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith, was a Colony of <HI>Macedonians,</HI> and had two Temples near it in the&s;e Plains; the mo&s;t beautiful of them dedicated to <HI>Hecate,</HI> and the other to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Chry&s;aorius:</HI> which was common to all the <HI>Carians,</HI> being the Place where they u&s;ed to meet, to &s;acrifice, and confer on Matters of State: which A&s;&s;embly of theirs was called <HI>Chry|&s;aorium.</HI> That which confirms me in this Opinion, is, That <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s Tables place <HI>Stratonicaea</HI> this way from <HI>Myla&s;&s;a;</HI> not that the di&s;tances do exactly agree: I think it may &s;uffice, that they do agree as well as other di&s;tances, his Tables commonly a&s;&s;igne. The re&s;t of our Friends Journey, was the <HI>Vi&s;iting of the Seven Churches</HI> of S^t <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Apocalyp&s;e;</HI> of which I have already given &s;ome Account.

But if &s;o, then may the Geographers mend their Maps. And &s;o only, as I can think on, what <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aid before, can be right. This Place is now called <HI>Guzel-Hi&s;&s;er,</HI> as M^r <HI>Smith,</HI> with great prabability, affirmeth; which is a large Walled Town, with hand&s;om Gates; well built within, and adorn'd with &s;everal Mo&s;ques.

But whe|ther the Medal belonged to this <HI>Antiochia</HI> upon the <HI>Meander,</HI> is hard to determine. They have both the &s;ame Rever&s;e; to wit, a Head crowned with a Tower, having a kind of Coiff behind it, and over it a <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> if I can di&s;cern aright; on each &s;ide is fir&s;t

<HI>Of Antioch</HI>&mdash;. But the la&s;t word I know not how to interpret. I have viewed narrowly, to find, whether it is not <HI>Metropol&ohgr;n;</HI> which <HI>Suidas</HI> interprets the Title of a City, which hath &s;ent Colonies, or Plantations, as the Mother of other Cities. But the K. is plain in one of them, and in the other &s;eemeth not to be a &Pgr;. <HI>Strabo</HI> mentions a Lake, five or &s;ix Miles from <HI>Sardis,</HI> called in his time
&Kgr;&Ogr;&Lgr;&Ogr;&Ngr;; but in <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Ogygia;</HI> where there was a Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> much celebrated. Whether this might not be a Colony of <HI>Antioch</HI> upon the <HI>Meander,</HI> whence they of <HI>An|tioch</HI> a&s;&s;um'd the Title of
&Mgr;&EEgr;&Tgr;&Rgr;&Ogr;&Kgr;&Ogr;&Lgr;&Ogr;&Ngr;S,
is a conjecture; but of no great weight, I confe&s;s. Of this <HI>Antiochia</HI> I have no other thing to &s;ay, than what <HI>Strabo</HI> long &s;ince remarked; which is, That it was built on both &s;ides of that Part of the <HI>Meander,</HI> which is towards <HI>Phry|gia,</HI> in a very fruitful Soil.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another I bought at <HI>Smyrna;</HI> which I e&s;teem very much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. <HI>87.</HI></NOTE> becau&s;e I have &s;een it in none of the Cabinets, or Collections of Medals, any where. It is one of tho&s;e &s;orts, that the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Madalioni;</HI> the <HI>French, Medalion:</HI> being larger, and of more accurate Work, than the ordinary Medals: which Medali&s;ts divide either into Silver, or little, middle, or great Bra&s;s. Be&s;ides, in them is the Head and Shoulders ex|pre&s;&s;ed; which is not ordinary in others. This is of Bra&s;s, with the Bu&s;t of the Emperour <HI>Valerianus,</HI> crowned with a radiant Crown, and the Drapery on his Shoulders, and the whole Work admirably well exe|cuted in a high <HI>Relievo;</HI> and his Name expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Letters,

On the Rever&s;e is a Ta|ble, or Altar, &s;u&s;tain'd by two <HI>Lyons,</HI> and Palm-Trees in the middle. On the top are placed two Urns, with Palm-Branches i&s;&s;uing out of them. On the fir&s;t are Letters illegible; on the other may be read,

&Egr;&Pgr;&Igr; &Agr;&Rgr;&KHgr;&Ogr;. &Igr;&Ogr;&Ugr;&Lgr;&Igr;&Agr;&Ngr;&Ogr;&Ugr;:
Which la&s;t marketh, That the Coyn was &s;tamped under the Government of <HI>Julia|nus;</HI> the next, That it was of the City <HI>Aphrodi&s;aea;</HI> and that upon the Urns &s;heweth, That Games were there in&s;tituted to the Honour of the Emperour <HI>Valerianus.</HI> I place this <HI>Medalion</HI> here, becau&s;e <HI>Aphrodi&s;aea</HI> is not far from tho&s;e Places before-mentioned, beyond the <HI>Meander;</HI> as by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> may appear. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> mentioneth a Well of Salt Water here, like Sea-Water.

So that the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, in vain, excu&s;e their Wor|&s;hipping of Images, by telling, They are not &s;o &s;tupid, as to believe, that their Statues and Pictures are really God, or their Saints; and that they make them, only to honour them; u&s;e them, only to put them in mind of them in Heaven: when, upon due Examination, the Heathens will be found to have done ju&s;t the &s;ame thing; and excu&s;e them&s;elves as well, as to the making of Images, and wor&s;hipping them in honour of their Gods; &s;eeing they believed their Idols to be only honorary Repre&s;entations of them, and not their Deities indeed. And &s;o the Modern <HI>Romans</HI> will be found as great Breakers of the <HI>Second Commandment,</HI> as their Ance&s;tors were of both <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>Second;</HI> this Commandment generally forbidding making all manner of Images, and Repre&s;entations, as mediate Objects of Wor&s;hip and Devotion, as the other forbids all other immediate Objects of Wor&s;hip, be&s;ides the One, only true God: Upon which account al&s;o, no doubt, they are defective. But it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to upbraid them; much rather, it is my Prayers, That they would open their Eyes, and &s;ee the great Light now &s;hining among&s;t us.</P>

<P>The Ships we had &s;o long attended, for our Pa&s;&s;age on to <HI>Zant,</HI> were the <HI>Dragon,</HI> and the <HI>Dartmouth</HI> Frigats: Of the fir&s;t S^r <HI>Roger Strickland</HI> was then Captain, and carried the Flag as Convoy to the <HI>London-Merchant;</HI> and the <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> who being laded at <HI>Smyr|na,</HI> were bound for <HI>London.</HI> S^r <HI>John Temple</HI> was Captain of the <HI>Dart|mouth;</HI> who with great Civility received us aboard on his Ship, and gave us the be&s;t Accommodation in it that he could; making me his titular Lieutenant, for want of his real one, whom he left &s;ick in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;eventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> we went on Board; which be|ing &s;pent in taking leave of our Friends, who mo&s;t obligingly accom|panied us, the next Morning, by three of the Clock, we hoi&s;ted &s;ail, having a fair and gentle Gale to bring us out of the Bay. From the Ca&s;tle the Chanel is made narrow by the Sands on the North-&s;ide: But I ob&s;erved, we &s;teered as near the Southern Shore, as po&s;&s;ible; and doing &s;o, there is no danger. We left <HI>Foia Vechia</HI> on the right hand in &s;ight, and <HI>Vourla</HI> on the left, upon the <HI>Cape,</HI> called by the <HI>Turks, Calabouroun,</HI> and by the Engli&s;h, <HI>Cape Giobernole;</HI> but antient|ly it was call'd <HI>Argennum.</HI> Between This, and the oppo&s;ite Shore, are two little I&s;lands, at the Mouth of the Bay. After we were out, we pa&s;&s;ed along the Shore of tho&s;e high Mountains, called <HI>The Brothers,</HI> and in the Evening had the <HI>Aleman</HI> again&s;t us more South. But the next day the Wind turning South-We&s;t, and continuing &s;o for two days, we could make no way; only boarding between the I&s;le <HI>Scio</HI> and <HI>P&s;ara,</HI> till the Twenty fir&s;t day; when, with much ado, we doubled <HI>P&s;ara;</HI> and having now more Sea room, we came in &s;ight of
<PB N="286" REF="111"><HI>Negropont.</HI> But the next Bord, the Wind blowing extream hard, &s;et us back again by the next day within <HI>P&s;ara. Wedne&s;day</HI> the Twenty third, was &s;pent in a very great Storm: For about ten a clock on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> night, from the high Mountains of <HI>Scio</HI> were poured down &s;uch furious Bla&s;ts of Wind, accompanied with &s;uch prodigious Thunder and Lightning, as was ready every Moment to over-&s;et the Ship, break the Ma&s;ts, and rent the Sails, before they could furl them. The Sea|men were all in a confu&s;ion, and could not agree what to do; whe|ther to lowre the main Sail, or to furl it, or let it alone as it was. But at la&s;t they concluded to let it alone, and luff as near the Wind as they could; and &s;o let her drive. It la&s;ted not in this extremity a|bove an hour and half, or two hours; but blew very hard all Night, and the next day: But on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning it was calm. In this Storm we broke the <HI>Whip-&s;tock,</HI> and &s;plit the <HI>Stem</HI> down to the <HI>Rudder:</HI> But the Carpenter &s;oon bound it about with Iron Hoops he had ready for &s;uch Accidents. It fared not much better with the Merchants, and other Ships; mo&s;t of them having rent their Sails: But ours being the lea&s;t, it was more to&s;&s;ed than they. So &s;oon as it was calm, the re&s;t of the Captains went on Board the <HI>Dragon,</HI> to con|&s;ult what &s;hould be done in ca&s;e of a Separation, if the Storm &s;hould return. They all concluded, That if the Separation was made by a South-Wind, they &s;hould meet at <HI>Tenedos;</HI> if by a North, then at <HI>Milo.</HI> After this &s;everal days we &s;pent, tacking to and fro, not being able to make any way; until <HI>Monday</HI> the Twenty eighth, the Wind came to the North-Ea&s;t Point, and brought us to the Pa&s;&s;age between the I&s;lands <HI>Andros</HI> and <HI>Negropont.</HI> But growing very high near Night, they dur&s;t not venture among the I&s;lands in the dark; e&s;pecially be|cau&s;e of a low Rock in this Pa&s;&s;age, which might have proved Fa|tal. They re&s;olved therefore to bord it till Morning; when we found our &s;elves over again&s;t the Pa&s;&s;age between <HI>Micone</HI> and <HI>Tine,</HI> with the Wind fair to pa&s;s. But the Merchant-men were &s;o far behind, and being deep laden, &s;o &s;low, that we were forced to lowre our Top-&s;ail to &s;tay for them, and &s;o were becalmed within two Leagues of the Pa&s;&s;age. Some hours after, the Wind ro&s;e contrary; but at night it changed again, and brought a mo&s;t furious North-Wind, that drove the Waters into &s;uch Heaps, as made them &s;eem, as if the Rocky I&s;lands of tho&s;e Seas had broke loo&s;e. We rent the Mizen-&s;ail from top to bottom, and endangered both the Main-&s;ail and Ma&s;t; and not a Sail left, but was forc'd the next day to be changed. The Wind abated nothing of its force, nor the Sea of its raging, making the Ve&s;&s;el often heel; &s;o that the Water would &s;ometimes come over the Lee-board. We lay as clo&s;e to the Wind Ea&s;t-wards, as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid the Shores of <HI>Micone,</HI> and <HI>Tine,</HI> as I &s;aid; and found our &s;elves this Morning drove &s;ixty Miles near <HI>Nicaria;</HI> where the Shipwrack of <HI>Icarus</HI> gave name to tho&s;e Seas about it, and was no good <HI>Omen</HI> to us in &s;uch extremi|ty of Weather. This Morning al&s;o we mi&s;s'd one of our Ships; and could not imagine what Fate it had &s;uffered, &s;ince it had fared &s;o badly with us. Nor was it then time to &s;tay, and make &s;earch: but we pa&s;&s;ed on South-Ea&s;twards; and beyond <HI>Nicaria,</HI> we di&s;cerned <HI>Sa|mos</HI> North-Ea&s;t of us: and that day, with Wind in poop, and Waves
<PB N="287" REF="111">often above it, we made near an hundred Miles. In the Evening we &s;aw <HI>Stampalia,</HI> which we left at our right hand; and in the Night, with only the Main-&s;ail, we made as far as <HI>Scarpanto;</HI> which is an I&s;le of near fifty Miles about, con&s;i&s;ting of Hills and Mountains not unfruitful. They &s;aid, We &s;aw <HI>Rhodes;</HI> and we re&s;olved to go round about <HI>Candia;</HI> where I often wi&s;hed my &s;elf on &s;hore, to &s;ee that Place &s;o famous for curious Plants: who&s;e high Mountains where they grow, we often di&s;cerned. And then we were pa&s;t the greate&s;t danger, ha|ving Sea-room enough; and both Sea and Winds growing more gen|tle, we again recovered our Spirits, and were glad that God had &s;o de|livered us.</P>
<P>But we made it &s;eventeen or eighteen days more, in all Thirty &s;e|ven days, before we arrived at <HI>Zant</HI> from <HI>Smyrna;</HI> which was on <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Eve,</HI> or the Twenty fourth of <HI>December,</HI> (old Style) which the <HI>Greeks</HI> yet continue to ob&s;erve, as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Here al&s;o we found the <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> which we feared had made &s;hipwrack the Night &s;he was &s;eparated from us: But, by God's help, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed well between the I&s;lands, and arrived hither fifteen days before us. So we all at la&s;t came &s;afe to our de&s;ired Port, and welcomed one another, giving God the Prai&s;e; as it is mo&s;t ju&s;t we &s;hould, for the &s;afety of each moment his good Providence &s;ecureth to us: But more e&s;pe|cially, for &s;uch eminent and extraordinary Deliverances; for we truly had &s;een God's Wonders in the Deep, and had experience of his Mer|cy towards tho&s;e, that go down to the Sea in Ships, employing them|&s;elves on the great Water-flouds. Then had we great rea&s;on to call to mind <HI>Holy David</HI>'s admirable De&s;cription of a Storm, we had in each point &s;o dreadfully experimented: How could we then forbear taking his Advice, and give Him the Prai&s;e, who &s;o graciou&s;ly was plea&s;ed to deliver us from tho&s;e Terrours of Death encompa&s;&s;ing of us round about. And how could we more acceptably expre&s;s our Gra|titude, than by that Sacred Hymn he had in&s;pired the be&s;t of Poets, as well as Kings, with; part of which I have endeavoured, in our Lan|guage, thus to Paraphra&s;e:

Both the&s;e Towns con&s;i&s;t, for the greate&s;t part, of Chri&s;tians, free from the Irregular In&s;ults of the <HI>Turks:</HI> But have a <HI>Turki&s;h Veivode</HI> over them.</P>
<P>Thence, after we had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing our good Friend, and of recruiting our Pur&s;es, the thirtieth of <HI>December</HI> we proceeded more chearfully on our Voyage. Keeping along the Shore of <HI>Aetolia,</HI> we ob&s;erved extraordinary great Flights of <HI>Pelicans,</HI> and other Fowls; and not far thence met with a Boat, that was a fi&s;hing; of whom, be&s;ides a good di&s;h of Fi&s;h we bought, we ob&s;erved, among the re&s;t, a kind of Fi&s;h the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Fulpo,</HI> and the <HI>Greeks Octopodia;</HI> becau&s;e at one end, &s;preading them&s;elves abroad, it is divided into eight long Points; each of which points are full of Knobs, like Warts, whereby it &s;ticketh fa&s;t to any thing it toucheth. In the Center of the&s;e Feet is its place for the Evacuation of its Excrements; &s;melling as &s;weet as Musk. The other end is a round, lumpy Sub&s;tance, filled with its Gar|badge: whence the <HI>Italian</HI> Name &s;eemeth to be taken. Here we &s;aw al&s;o another &s;ort of Fi&s;h, of near a foot long, with a very &s;harp Beak, and &s;lender: They call it a <HI>Needle Fi&s;h.</HI> Another we &s;aw, &s;omething
<PB N="292" REF="114">like an Eele for &s;hape; but the Fle&s;h ta&s;teth, and is coloured like a Whiting: They call it <HI>Grongo.</HI> Another they call <HI>Barbouni;</HI> which I take to be the &s;ame with our <HI>Gournits,</HI> only their Beards are longer, and are of a red colour, like a boyled Lob&s;ter, their Scales are al&s;o all in one, and hard.</P>
<P>From this Point we cro&s;&s;ed over to <HI>Patras,</HI> leaving on our right hand the Promontory <HI>Mauromidie,</HI> and about a dozen Miles from <HI>Pa|tras,</HI> a Town in &s;ight of it, called <HI>Mamminizza,</HI> &s;ituated upon both &s;ides of a River, two or three Miles from the Sea. This Village was, in all likelihood, the antient City <HI>Olenus,</HI> and the River the antient <HI>Pi|rus;</HI> which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> puts about ten Miles from <HI>Patras.</HI> Nearer to <HI>Pa|tras</HI> one leaves the old Fortre&s;s of <HI>Achaia</HI> now &s;lighted; and, as my Companion ob&s;erves, a Torrent, who&s;e Channel was then dry, called now by the <HI>Greeks Leucas,</HI> and by <HI>Pau&s;anias Glaucos;</HI> all which Pla|ces are in the <HI>Achaia</HI> of <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> To the other hand, on the <HI>Ro|manian</HI> Shore, are two very high-piked Mountains; the fir&s;t of which is called <HI>Gallata,</HI> from a Town behind it, bearing that Name: which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> thinketh to be the antient <HI>Calydon.</HI> Beyond the other Mountain we had the two Ca&s;tles at the Mouth of the Gulph in &s;ight. Of <HI>Calydon Pau&s;anias</HI> telleth this &s;ad Love &s;tory: <Q><HI>Core&s;us,</HI> the Prie&s;t of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> fell in love with a fair Virgin of the Town, called <HI>Cal|lirhoe;</HI> who the more &s;he was courted, the more &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed the Prie&s;t; &s;o that neither his rich Pre&s;ents, Vows, nor Tears could move her to the lea&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion. This, at la&s;t, made the Prie&s;t run in de&s;pair to the Image of <HI>Bacchus</HI> for &s;uccour, imploring Vengeance from him. <HI>Bacchus</HI> made it appear that he heard his Prayers, by a Di&s;ea&s;e he &s;ent on the Town; which &s;eemed a kind of <HI>Drunken Madne&s;s,</HI> of which mad Fit the People died in abundance. Whereupon they &s;ent Deputies from <HI>Calydon,</HI> to the Oracle of <HI>Jupiter</HI> of <HI>Dodona;</HI> which was in reputation, in tho&s;e days, among&s;t the <HI>Etolians, Acarnanians,</HI> and all the Country of <HI>Epirus,</HI> to know what they &s;hould do to be freed from that woeful Malady. An&s;wer was given, That <HI>Core&s;us</HI> mu&s;t &s;acrifice <HI>Callirhoe,</HI> or &s;ome other Per&s;on, that would dedicate him&s;elf in her &s;tead, to appea&s;e the Anger of <HI>Bacchus.</HI> The Virgin, when &s;he could no way obtain her Life of her Relations, was brought to the Altar, adorn'd as Victims u&s;ed to be, to be &s;acrificed by her Lover <HI>Core&s;us:</HI> Who&s;e wonderful Love, even at that pre&s;ent, &s;o conquered all pa&s;t thoughts of Revenge, that in&s;tead of her he &s;lew him&s;elf; and became a Victim to generous Love, in&s;tead of being any longer the Prie&s;t of <HI>Bacchus.</HI> The Virgin al&s;o, relenting of her Cruelty to him, went and &s;lew her &s;elf at a Fountain without the Town, from thence called by her name, <HI>Callirhoe.</HI></Q> But whether <HI>Gallata,</HI> or the Ruins of another Town, not far from thence towards <HI>Me&s;&s;alongia,</HI> which S^r <HI>Cle|ment Harby</HI> told me he &s;aw there, be the antient <HI>Calydon,</HI> I cannot de|termin, unle&s;s I had &s;een them both. We arrived at <HI>Patras</HI> that After|noon early.</P>
<P><HI>Patras</HI> is &s;ituated upon an Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PATRAS. CERYNEA.</NOTE> not above half a Mile from the Sea, at the foot of an high Mountain, which I think was called <HI>Cerynea,</HI> with a Valley between. It hath a Ca&s;tle on the highe&s;t Point of the Hill, and a De&s;cent every way into a fruitful Valley, well planted with Orange,
<PB N="293" REF="114">Limons, and Citrons, &s;o much e&s;teemed for their delicious Ta&s;te.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M. Pau&s;a.</HI> l. vii. p. 448.</NOTE> <HI>Pa|tras</HI> was the antient, as well as the modern Name of the Place; and is undoubtedly the &s;ame with that of the <HI>Romans,</HI> being made a <HI>Ro|man</HI> Colony by <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> after it had been, for &s;ome time, de&s;troy|ed by more antient Fates. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> telleth, That it was fir&s;t built by one <HI>Eumelus,</HI> Native of the Country; who having received the manner how to build from <HI>Triptolemus,</HI> as likewi&s;e Corn, and how to &s;ow it, named the Place he built, from his tilling the Ground, <HI>Aroa.</HI> Afterwards, when the <HI>Ionians</HI> were driven out of the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian A|chaia,</HI> one called <HI>Patreus</HI> enlarged it; &s;o that <HI>Aroa,</HI> and its Walls, were contained within the new Walls he made about it, and the City called by his own Name, <HI>Patras.</HI> After this it came again to be depopula|ted, by occa&s;ion of their &s;ending Succour to the <HI>Etolians</HI> again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> by whom the <HI>Etolians</HI> being in many Combats defeated, the re&s;t that e&s;caped, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into &s;everal Cities thereabout, un|til the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar;</HI> who being moved either with the Con|veniency of the Haven, or &s;ome other private Rea&s;on, commanded the People of &s;undry Towns round about <HI>Patras,</HI> to come and abide there: Which that they might more willingly do, he adorned the Place with all the Priviledges of a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony; calling it <HI>Colonia Augu&s;ti, Aroa Patren&s;is,</HI> as may be confirmed by divers Medals. In my &s;mall Collecti|on I have two. The fir&s;t is of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> with this Rever&s;e: A Figure &s;tanding in a <HI>Roman</HI> Habit, with a pair of Oxen before him; and the&s;e Letters above, <HI>Col. A. A.</HI> and under, <HI>Patren&s;.</HI> which are the Ab|breviation of <HI>Colonia Augu&s;ti, Aroa Patren&s;is,</HI> or <HI>Patren&s;ium;</HI> that is, <HI>A|roa of the Patra&s;&s;ians, the Colony or Plantation of</HI> Augu&s;tus. Another I have of the Emperour <HI>Domitian;</HI> which is the only one I have &s;een of that Rever&s;e, and never yet engraven. It hath for Rever&s;e a Pillar upon a large <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> which &s;eemeth to me to be of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Order, with a Statue upon it, and round about the&s;e Letters, <HI>Col. A. A. Patren&s;.</HI> which are to be interpreted as the former. And by it may be learned, That <HI>Domitian</HI> adorned the Town with &s;ome Magnificent Pillar, on the top of which he placed his own Statue. And not long &s;ince, the <HI>French Vice-Con&s;ul</HI> there found one in his Garden of the Emperour <HI>Clau|dius;</HI> which had for Rever&s;e the Military En&s;igns of the <HI>Romans,</HI> with the &s;ame Letters as before, only XXII added; which &s;ignifieth no more, than that the <HI>Twenty &s;econd</HI> Legion was at that time there. As to the State of this Town in the <HI>Roman</HI> times, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> hath given an ample Account; what now remaineth of it, is but little in proportion: Although for that the de&s;troying <HI>Turks,</HI> undoubtedly, ought to bear the blame, and not the Chri&s;tians; as may appear from the many ruined Churches, in all its antient bounds: which reached as far as the Sea We&s;twards; but not &s;o far Ea&s;t: And having &s;till enjoyed the Honour of an Arch-Bi&s;hoprick; who&s;e Pa&s;tor u&s;ed, in antient times, to have the Thirty-&s;econd Place in the Councils, or general A&s;&s;emblies of the Church. The pre&s;ent Arch-Bi&s;hop is called <HI>Daniel;</HI> whom we went to pay our Re&s;pects to. He told us, That he had a thou&s;and Churches in his Province; which extends it &s;elf over all the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>Morea,</HI> as far as <HI>Corone.</HI> There was another Metropolitan then with him, to wit, the Metropolitan of <HI>Napoli</HI> of <HI>Romagnia,</HI> called by
<PB N="294" REF="115">the Greeks <HI>Anaplia.</HI> The two other Arch-Bi&s;hopricks are <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;itra;</HI> &s;ituate not above four Miles from the antient Ruins of <HI>Lace|daemon,</HI> as M^r <HI>Vernon</HI> affirmeth. The highe&s;t Point of the Hill, where|on the City &s;tandeth, hath a Ca&s;tle kept by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and commanded then by one <HI>Hebby-Bey.</HI> Within it formerly were the Temples of <HI>Dia|na Li-pathria,</HI> and of <HI>Minerva Panachaida,</HI> or the <HI>Protectre&s;s</HI> of all <HI>A|chaia.</HI> The Monument al&s;o of <HI>Euripilus,</HI> Son of <HI>Euaemon,</HI> who was at the &s;acking of <HI>Troy:</HI> of which &s;ee <HI>Pau&s;anias.</HI> What now remains of them in the Ca&s;tle, I can give no Account; becau&s;e we were not per|mitted to enter into it. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;peaketh of many more, in the Mar|ket-place: But now there is only the <HI>Cathedral</HI> Church to be &s;een, turn|ed into a <HI>Mo&s;que.</HI></P>
<P>We lodged at S^r <HI>Clement Harby</HI>'s Hou&s;e, Con&s;ul of the <HI>Morea</HI> and <HI>Zant.</HI> He was not there at this time; but as we returned, he was, and &s;hewed us many things we had not before &s;een. The fir&s;t Evening we arrived there, we went to &s;ee the Church dedicated to S^t <HI>John,</HI> S^t <HI>George,</HI> and S^t <HI>Nicholas,</HI> a little de&s;cending the Hill We&s;twards, where we heard the <HI>Greek</HI> Ve&s;pers, wor&s;e &s;ung than <HI>Hopkin</HI>'s P&s;alms u&s;ed to be in &s;ome of our Country Churches. It is a very antient Church; but hath ill-favour'd Arches within, though &s;u&s;tained by beautiful Pil|lars of the <HI>Ionique</HI> Order. On the out-&s;ide, among many &s;craps of Mar|ble, is the <HI>Ba&s;&s;o relievo</HI> of a Peacock, &s;itting upon a three-leav'd Tree, I gue&s;s to be <HI>Anagyris,</HI> which is not wanting in tho&s;e Parts: Whence we judged al&s;o, That the Church was built out of the Ruins of &s;ome Temple of <HI>Juno,</HI> which might have been thereabouts. At the Door of this Church is a Stone, which being &s;truck by another Stone, &s;endeth out a &s;tinking Bituminous Savour: This the <HI>Greeks</HI> make a Miracle, tel|ling, That the Judge, when he condemn'd S^t <HI>Andrew,</HI> &s;ate upon that Stone; which hath ever &s;ince had that ill Scent. But I have &s;melt the like &s;mell in other Stones, when broken; e&s;pecially a little long Stone found about <HI>Oxford,</HI> among&s;t the Gravel. The report of S^t <HI>Andrew,</HI> That he &s;taid a great while at <HI>Patras;</HI> and that before he &s;uffered Martyrdom there, he converted a King of the <HI>Morea;</HI> meaning, per|haps, no more than &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Governour of that Province. They had antiently &s;everal Churches here dedicated to him; one of which we went next day to &s;ee, &s;ituated near the Sea-&s;ide; which is indeed a very old, ruinous Building. There are two great vaulted Rooms, &s;tanding parallel to each other, in it; and the Foundations of two more appear on each &s;ide: which together are Forty &s;ix paces, and two feet wide. One of them, which I gue&s;s, was properly made u&s;e of for a Church, hath part of a <HI>Cuppalo</HI> yet &s;tanding on the Ea&s;t end; with great Niches in it for Statues, and many le&s;&s;er in other Parts: Which made me then believe, that it had been more antiently either a <HI>Roman Temple</HI> or <HI>Bath;</HI> for by it I ob&s;erved a Fountain of fre&s;h Water, al|though it is but a &s;tone's-ca&s;t from the Sea. And <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> confirms me in the &s;ame; &s;aying, That the Temple of <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Ceres</HI> were &s;ituate in the lower Parts of the Town; and that this la&s;t had a Fountain with|out the Wall, by which the Events of &s;ick Per&s;ons were known, by hanging up a Looking-gla&s;s in &s;uch &s;ort by a Thred, that it touched the Water only on the Back-&s;ide; in which Gla&s;s, the &s;ick Per&s;ons looking,
<PB N="295" REF="115">&s;aw Figures, which &s;hewed what they mu&s;t tru&s;t to.</P>
<P>Returning thence South-Ea&s;twards, towards the Town, we pa&s;t by the Ruins of a round Temple of Brick, ma&s;oned together with a very hard Cement, and the Building very ma&s;&s;ive: over again&s;t which, North|wards, is a demoli&s;hed <HI>Greek</HI> Church, dedicated to the Holy Apo&s;tles; which hath been &s;u&s;tained by Marble Pillars of the <HI>Ionique</HI> Order. Not far from hence appear &s;ome Parts of the antient Walls of the Town: One of tho&s;e Heaps of Ruins may have been the Temple of <HI>Cybele,</HI> the Mother of the Gods; wherein <HI>Attes</HI> al&s;o was honoured. But we could not find the <HI>Theater,</HI> nor the <HI>Odeum,</HI> nor many other Temples, which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;peaks of. Under the Wall of the Town is a Place, that &s;eemeth to have been a <HI>Circus,</HI> or <HI>Stadium,</HI> or perhaps a <HI>Naumachia</HI> for Water Combats. For the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> told me, That many in the Town can yet remember, that there was an Iron Ring fa&s;tened to the Wall; which they &s;uppo&s;e, was to tie Ve&s;&s;els to; &s;uppo&s;ing, that the Sea came up thither, in former days: but the other Buildings, nearer the Sea-&s;ide, evince that Errour. Perhaps, Water might be brought thither by a Cha|nel, or Aqueduct: But the Sea is near a quarter of a Mile from thence, and lies much lower. The &s;ides con&s;i&s;ted of Ranges of Arches; which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> remembers he hath &s;een repre&s;ented on Medals of <HI>Patras.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Med. <HI>110.</HI></NOTE> Not far thence is the Foundation of a Church, dedicated to S^t <HI>Andrew;</HI> where they believe, that Apo&s;tle baptized the King he had converted to the Faith. The Building &s;eemeth to have been formerly a <HI>Roman</HI> Se|pulcher. That which induceth me to think &s;o, is a Vault underneath it; round which are Niches; in every one of which are two holes at the bottom, made with Earthen Pots; which are plai&s;tered up, round a|bout, to the top: ju&s;t &s;uch as I &s;aw &s;everal at <HI>Baia,</HI> by <HI>Puzzuolo</HI> in <HI>Ita|ly.</HI> That they are in Niches &s;o by pairs, argueth, that it was done with de&s;ign to put the A&s;hes of the Husbands and Wives of the Family, near each other. But the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;ay, The Pots were made to put Holy Wa|ter in; which they pre&s;erve in Pots, making it but once a Year. How true this is, I know not: but it is certain, this Place hath &s;ince been made u&s;e of for a Church; and, perhaps, tho&s;e <HI>&V;rns,</HI> or <HI>Ollae,</HI> made u&s;e of to hold Holy Water, in later times.</P>
<P>Hence we went by the Town; and near two Miles beyond it South-We&s;twards, we came to the Gardens, called <HI>Glycada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GLYCADA</NOTE> where tho&s;e deli|cious Citrons grow, I told you of: Some of which we ta&s;ted very good; but the be&s;t were already de&s;troyed by the <HI>French,</HI> who had been there to lade Provi&s;ions for <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI> The bigge&s;t are as large as two, or three fair Limons; and the white within the Rind, is very well ta|&s;ted; but the little Juyce it hath in the middle, is &s;owr. Neither here, nor any where el&s;e in <HI>Turky</HI> do they ob&s;erve any great Order in laying out, and making their Gardens. They &s;et their Trees not &s;o much as in rowes, nor take &s;o much care of them, as we do of Apples and Pears. In the chiefe&s;t of the&s;e Gardens we &s;aw a wonderful great Cypre&s;s-tree; who&s;e Dimen&s;ions I took, and are the&s;e: The Body, a foot from the Ground, is Twenty one foot about. Four foot from the ground, &s;even|teen foot and eleven inches about. The Boughs &s;pread out from the Body, Twenty eight feet and a half, rather more than le&s;s. It makes a large, and mo&s;t delightful Shade, &s;carce penetrable by the Sun. The
<PB N="296" REF="116">Ground under it is laid in a Square, with Chanels for Water to run about it; which they have in plenty, and lead about as they plea&s;e, to wa|ter their Trees and Herbs. The good Man that kept the Garden, made us a Pre&s;ent of Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Pomegrantes, and Walnuts, in a hand&s;om Basket, covered with No&s;egays of Violets. Whereupon, &s;ending for Bread and Pitch-Wine, for which <HI>Patras</HI> is celebra|ted, we drank our Mornings Draught, and our Friends good Healths; wi&s;hing them as good Wine and Cheer, but not &s;o far from their Homes to drink it. The Oranges here are much the &s;ame with <HI>Sevil Oranges,</HI> for ta&s;te and &s;hape.</P>
<P>Hence we returned Northwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIEROCO|MIUM.</NOTE> to the Covent <HI>Hierocomium,</HI> on the top of a Hill, which hath about a dozen <HI>Caloyers,</HI> and a Church dedicated to the Holy Virgin; which is built with no great Art, but well adorned according to their Mode, with Pictures and Silver Lamps before them. Here is a Latine In&s;cription in this Church; but &s;o de|faced, that not much can be learned from it. My Comerade &s;peaks of another we &s;aw; which &s;hewed, That the Covent was built out of the Ruins of the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Achaia,</HI> which is about ten Miles from <HI>Patras.</HI> It is writ in Modern <HI>Greek,</HI> very difficult to be copied or read.</P>

<P>From this Mona&s;tery is a good Pro&s;pect over the Plain, Southward, well planted with Olive-yards, Vine-yards, and Corn. There is &s;uch another Northwards of the City; but not &s;een from thence.</P>
<P>Thence returning to the Town, over the Hills, We&s;twards, we pa&s;&s;ed by an antient <HI>Aqueduct,</HI> who&s;e Ruins are very high and &s;tately; but of Brick. It hath two Arches one above another; and the <HI>Pila&s;ter</HI> of each is propped on both &s;ides with Buttrices of the &s;ame. Higher up the Stream are two more, and better pre&s;erved. All of them joyn two Hills together; between which runs a &s;mall Stream; which was, perhaps, the <HI>Miliclus.</HI> For it is the neare&s;t to the Town on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide. If &s;o, up|on its Banks was &s;ituate the Temple of <HI>Diana Triclaria:</HI> on its Banks was al&s;o an Altar, whereupon Human Sacrifices were offered to <HI>Diana Lapa|thria;</HI> who&s;e Temple was in the Ca&s;tle. The rea&s;on of which <HI>Pau&s;a|nias</HI> relateth to this effect: <Q>Her Rites being celebrated by Virgins, un|til they were married; It happened, that a young and beautiful Vir|gin, called <HI>Comaethlia,</HI> had that Office; with whom a Youth of the Town, of no le&s;s Comline&s;s, and excellent Proportion, fell deeply in love; and without difficulty, gain'd the Virgin's Heart: But when he asked his froward Father's con&s;ent, he denied him, and would by
<PB N="297" REF="116">no means con&s;ent to it. The Lovers being impatient of &s;o unnatu|ral a Re&s;traint, continu'd their Amours, and fulfilled their De&s;ires &s;e|cretly in the Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> as if they had been married. But &s;oon after both died, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> and paid for their Impiety to the God|de&s;s: for after a little while the Ground was &s;truck with a great Bar|renne&s;s, and the City with a dreadful Pe&s;tilence: Upon which the Oracle of <HI>Delphos</HI> being con&s;ulted, An&s;wer was made, That the lu&s;t|ful Actions of <HI>Menalippus</HI> and <HI>Comaethlia</HI> was the rea&s;on; and that to appea&s;e <HI>Diana,</HI> they mu&s;t yearly &s;acrifice to her the mo&s;t beautiful Youth, and Virgin of the whole Town: Which Cu&s;tom was to la&s;t, till an unknown King &s;hould come, and bring a &s;trange Deity with him. In Proce&s;s of time, when <HI>Troy</HI> was taken, and overthrown by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> in the divi&s;ion of the Spoil, and &s;acking of the Town, <HI>Eu|rypylus,</HI> King of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> lighted upon a Coffer, which contain'd an Image of <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> or <HI>Bacchus,</HI> made by <HI>Vulcan,</HI> for an Offering to <HI>Jupiter Dardanius.</HI> This Coffer <HI>Eurypylus</HI> no &s;ooner look'd into, but he became Lunatick, with very little or no intermi&s;&s;ion. Wherefore he return'd not directly home to <HI>The&s;&s;aly;</HI> but &s;ailed fir&s;t to <HI>Cyrrha,</HI> and came thence to <HI>Delphos,</HI> to con&s;ult the Oracle there: Who&s;e An|&s;wer was, That when he came to a Place, where he found the People offering a &s;trange Sacrifice, he &s;hould there dedicate his Image, and there abide. Thence returning, the Winds brought him to <HI>Patras;</HI> where he went a&s;hore, and by chance found the People about to &s;a|crifice a Youth, and a Virgin, who were then &s;tanding at the Altar of <HI>Diana Triclaria,</HI> ready to be &s;lain: which made him quickly call to mind the words of the Oracle, that agreed &s;o well to what he &s;aw here. The People al&s;o, &s;eeing a &s;trange King, whom they had neither &s;een, nor heard of before, were no le&s;s moved at his Pre&s;ence, and at the Coffer which he brought; not doubting, but that it contain'd &s;ome &s;acred thing, as it did. So that remembring the An&s;wers <HI>Apollo</HI> had &s;everally given them, there was great Joy on both &s;ides; the King, that he found him&s;elf by this means re&s;tored to his right Mind; and the City, that they were delivered and &s;et free from &s;uch a barbarous Cu&s;tom. From this cruel Sacrifice, the River, at which it was, u&s;ually done, had got the Name of <HI>Amilichus,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay <HI>&V;nmerciful.</HI> But when the wicked Rite and Cu&s;tom thus expired, it came to be called <HI>Milichus,</HI> which &s;ignifieth <HI>Compa&s;&s;ionate,</HI> or <HI>Tender-hearted;</HI> whereas be|fore it was not known to have any Name at all.</Q> The Stream runs thence South-We&s;twards, and &s;o winds about the Town to the Sea.</P>
<P>Thence pa&s;&s;ing over the River, and up the Hill near the Town, we came to the <HI>Jews</HI> Burying-place; where I ob&s;erved their Sepulchers to be made in the fa&s;hion of little Hou&s;es of Stone-building; having at each end a Marble-Stone, whereon is engraven an In&s;cription of their Name and Family: which looking like the Doors of the little Hou&s;es of Death, make the Burying-place &s;eem a great Town, when it is viewed at a di&s;tance from the wrong end of a Micro&s;cope.</P>
<P>From hence leaving the Town on the left hand, we pa&s;&s;ed by the Ca&s;tle on our right; which is not much con&s;iderable, either for Beau|ty or Strength; having only one round Tower toward the Sea, a broad|&s;ide towards the Town, and ditch'd round about; being then comman|ded
<PB N="298" REF="117">by a <HI>Turk,</HI> called <HI>Hebbey-Bey,</HI> as is above-mentioned. Here is al|&s;o a <HI>Caddy,</HI> or Judge, to determine Civil Controver&s;ies, and a <HI>Veivode,</HI> who&s;e Office it is to execute the Determinations of the <HI>Caddy,</HI> and ga|ther the Rights and Duties upon Merchandizes and Provi&s;ions. He that was then <HI>Veivode,</HI> was called <HI>Abdi-Aga;</HI> who from his <HI>Sopha</HI> &s;pied my Comrade walking by before his Window; and perceiving him to be a Stranger, &s;ent a <HI>Janizary</HI> to him, to bring him before him; where, by a <HI>Jew,</HI> that was his Interpreter, he examin'd him <HI>what he was,</HI> and <HI>what he did in that Country?</HI> My Companion an&s;wered, That he was a Phy&s;ician; and that his pa&s;&s;ing near tho&s;e parts was, that he went to &s;ee a Friend of his, that was Con&s;ul at <HI>Athens.</HI> The Interpreter then made him under&s;tand, That he ought to have made the <HI>Veivode</HI> &s;ome Pre&s;ent, &s;taying in the Town. But to this he made him a Compliment, telling him, That he was no Merchant, that only bad Weather &s;taid him in Town, and that he had brought hardly enough to defray his own Ex|pences; far from being able to make Pre&s;ents to a Per&s;on of his Dig|nity: and &s;o he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. His Brother al&s;o, <HI>Haly Ba&s;ha,</HI> who was Ma&s;ter of the Cu&s;toms, hoped to have had &s;omething of us in this kind; and for fear we &s;hould part without paying his Dues, took the Rudder of our Barque, and locked it up in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e. The <HI>Turks</HI> are about a Third Part of the Town; with the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> the other Two Parts. They have &s;ix Mo&s;ques; one of which was formerly the Cathedral Church, and hath an Iron Chain gilded with Gold, hanging on the top of the <HI>Cuppalo:</HI> Which was the rea&s;on, that when it was taken from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as they &s;ay, the Town was pilla|ged; the <HI>Turks</HI> believing it to be Ma&s;&s;ive Gold, and that they could not but have great Riches in the City. The <HI>Jews,</HI> who make the &s;econd <HI>Third-part</HI> of the Town, have four Synagogues, with a kind of Polity among them&s;elves, and chu&s;ing antient Men to decide their own Diffe|rences. The whole number of <HI>Chri&s;tians, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> are reputed about four or five thou&s;and. Their Trade con&s;i&s;ts in raw Silks, made in the <HI>Morea,</HI> in good quantity. Leather is al&s;o cheap; and &s;o is Honey, Wax, Wool, and Chee&s;e. The Currans of <HI>Patras</HI> are e&s;teemed the be&s;t in tho&s;e Parts; but they have no great quantity of them: <HI>Patras, Na|thaligo,</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;a-longia,</HI> all three together, having enough to lade on|ly one good Ship every year. Here we went to vi&s;it the Vice-Con&s;ul of the <HI>French,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vitelin;</HI> who &s;hewed us a Marble Head of a Statue, found in digging his Garden; but &s;o defaced, that it could not be known for whom it was made: As al&s;o a Gold-Ring, &s;et with a Stone, having a Ca&s;tle engraven on it, and certain Gothick Letters about it.</P>
<P>We went al&s;o to vi&s;it the <HI>Venetian</HI> Con&s;ul, to have a Pa&s;s-port of him, becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul was not then there; and al&s;o becau&s;e our Boat-men were of <HI>Zant,</HI> under the <HI>Venetians.</HI> For none can pa&s;s in and out again the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> without leave of one of the Ca&s;tles at the Mouth; which Ca&s;tles are &s;o near to each other, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s out of Gun-&s;hot of one, or other, or both of them. Be&s;ides, if they let you pa&s;s into it, at <HI>Lepanto</HI> one runs the ri&s;que of having the Barque burned; and an <HI>Aveny</HI> &s;et upon you be&s;ides. To enter the Gulph, leave mu&s;t be had of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Morea;</HI> and to come out, of
<PB N="299" REF="117">that of <HI>Romelia:</HI> for &s;o only they di&s;tingui&s;h them. But when we had gotten this In&s;trument, we wanted another, to wit, the Rudder of our Bark; which, as I &s;aid, the <HI>Emir,</HI> or Receiver of Cu&s;toms, had taken away, that we might not part without his Knowledge. We could not for &s;ometime find him; and when we did, we were forced to buy it of him at the price of half a Crown.</P>

<P><HI>January</HI> the fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LEPANTO.</NOTE> we parted from <HI>Patras,</HI> and came to <HI>Lepanto</HI> that Evening, though it was pa&s;t Noon when we took Water. For we were pre&s;ently di&s;mi&s;s'd at the Ca&s;tle; and it is not e&s;teem'd above a dozen Miles di&s;tance from <HI>Patras</HI> to <HI>Lepanto;</HI> being in &s;ight of each other. From one Ca&s;tle to the other, is not above a Mile: But then the Gulph widens again on each &s;ide, unto <HI>Lepanto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lepanto</HI> is now the chief City of this Gulph, and of late hath given Name to it. It was called formerly <HI>Naupactus;</HI> and by the <HI>Greeks</HI> now, <HI>Epactos;</HI> only by the <HI>Franks, Lepanto. Ptolomy</HI> reckons it among tho&s;e of <HI>Locris Ozelorum.</HI> It is &s;ituate upon a very &s;teep Hill, with a De&s;cent every way from the top; but it is joyned to a Mountain behind it, by two other little Hills; which, &s;ince the Invention to a Mountain behind it, by two other little Hills; which, &s;ince the Invention of Gun-powder, com|mand it: But it was &s;o &s;trong in antient times, that it gave much di&s;|quiet to the <HI>Romans,</HI> being a Refuge for the Rebellious <HI>Etolians.</HI> It is built from the Sea-&s;hore up to the highe&s;t Point of the Hill, which is crowned with a little Ca&s;tle; to mount to which, one mu&s;t pa&s;s no le&s;s than four Ranges of Walls, one above another; which makes it, at a di&s;tance, &s;omewhat re&s;emble the <HI>Papal Crown.</HI> Their little Oval Har|bour is no &s;mall Ornament to it, being placed in the middle of the South|&s;ide, and having a little Tower at each &s;ide of the Entrance, with &s;ome
<PB N="300" REF="118">&s;mall Bra&s;s Guns in them. But the Mouth is &s;o narrow, that it may be &s;ecured by a Chain of fifty foot long; and is too &s;hallow for any Ve&s;|&s;els, be&s;ides Barques, and &s;mall Gallies; of which the la&s;t cannot come in, but in high Water. For there is a kind of Tide in this Gulph; in the Morning the Water comes in by the Ca&s;tles, and in the Evening it goes out; as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> ob&s;erved in his Return. This Harbour is well walled about within, and the Work looks antient.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of the City, under the Mountain, which I take to be the Mountain <HI>Corax,</HI> are fruitful Valleys to the Seaward: That We&s;t|ward is well planted with Olive-Trees, Vineyards, and Corn: That Ea&s;t|ward is no le&s;s well-&s;et, and divided into Gardens of Oranges, Citrons, and Limons without Seeds; being al&s;o well water'd with many pretty Streams, that i&s;&s;ue out of the Rocky Mountain above it; and in the Summer, 'tis &s;haded with abundance of large Plane-trees. There are not many Chri&s;tians here, the greate&s;t part being <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> and hath been a very great Harbour for Pirats. This was the Re&s;idence of the famous Cor&s;air, <HI>Durach-Bey;</HI> who made the Ships and Barques of the Chri&s;tians, in the&s;e Parts, tremble; and had the be&s;t Hou&s;e in the Town; although bad is the be&s;t now. He was for his valour ad|vanced to be a <HI>Captain Ba&s;ha</HI> in the War of <HI>Candia:</HI> But he had not long enjoyed that Honour, before he was &s;lain, and that in an Enterprize of his own undertaking; which was to &s;urprize the <HI>Venetian Armada</HI> by night. But they having notice of the de&s;ign, he was &s;urpriz'd him&s;elf, and after a bloody Conflict, was defeated with his Squadron, and &s;lain by a Cannon-Bullet.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Place con&s;i&s;ts in Leather, Oyl, Tabaco, Rice, Bar|ley, and Wheat. Furrs al&s;o are good cheap here; and therefore, by the Advice of our Ho&s;t, we lined our Ve&s;ts with good Fox-skins; which was but needful: For the Winter proved extream cold in tho&s;e Parts; and as we had from our Lodging the Pro&s;pect of tho&s;e Mountains about the Gulph covered with Snow; &s;o had we our &s;hare of the cold Wind, that blew from them, by rea&s;on of the bad Lodging provided us by the <HI>Frank-Con&s;ul,</HI> called <HI>Signior Samuel,</HI> on the Harbour. He informed us, That all who pa&s;s out of the Gulph, pay three <HI>per Cent.</HI> Cu&s;tom to the <HI>Emir,</HI> who payeth Six thou&s;and Crowns a year Rent for his Office. No great Ships of the <HI>Franks</HI> are permitted to come within the Ca&s;tles; but &s;tay at <HI>Patras,</HI> and &s;end in their Barques. Concerning which our Ho&s;t told us, That during the War at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el coming thi|ther, although he &s;taid without the Ca&s;tles with his Ship, and only with its Bark came thither, to treat with the <HI>Emir</HI> concerning the Cu&s;tom, and lodged with our Ho&s;t, the Vice-Con&s;ul: Yet &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Vei|vode</HI> heard of it, he &s;ent for him forthwith, and without any more ceremony had him ba&s;tinadoed; telling him, He had brought hither <HI>Malte&s;i</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;airs:</HI> while he in vain endeavoured to make his De|fence; and tell him, That the Ship came from <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and belonged to the King of <HI>France.</HI> For he &s;till confounded <HI>Malta</HI> with <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and would not under&s;tand any difference; until he had obliged the Captain of the Ship to pay him fifty Crowns, and given charge to get him gone with all &s;peed.</P>
<PB N="301" REF="118">
<P>Another came &s;ome time after, and to compliment the <HI>Veivode,</HI> &s;ent him &s;ome Sweet-meats by the Vice-Con&s;ul; which in&s;tead of being pleas'd with, the proud <HI>Turk</HI> &s;ent him back with this An&s;wer: <HI>What! does your Merchant take me to be a Child, that he &s;ends me Sweet-meats; and not Coffee, or &s;omething proper for Men?</HI> But I believe, Time, and &s;ome little prudent Behaviour towards them, would make them more tame; e&s;pecially when they &s;hould begin to find the Profit, which Trading would bring them. For nothing &s;o covetous, as a <HI>Turk:</HI> and indeed they have &s;ome rea&s;on to make the be&s;t of their Offices; for they pay commonly very dear for them.</P>
<P>We came in a very ill time to &s;ee this Place: For the next day, &s;o &s;oon as it was light, all the Barques were &s;eized upon, to bring over the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of the <HI>Morea;</HI> who had received Orders to come hither, and to <HI>Saint Mauro,</HI> to burn all the Galliots, or &s;mall Gallies of the Pirates he &s;hould find there. But they &s;taid not to be &s;o complemented by him. The whole Town was in a Con&s;ternation at his coming; none &s;tirred aborad, none opened their Shops or Doors. However we had the opportunity to &s;ee his Reception, without &s;tirring out of our Cham|ber; it over-looking the Harbour. The whole of his Train was near Five hundred Per&s;ons; of which fifty Sclavonians were his Guard. He cro&s;&s;ed over from <HI>Vo&s;titza,</HI> a Town of the <HI>Morea,</HI> oppo&s;ite to <HI>Lepanto.</HI> Before him in a Boat came Kettle-Drums, others playing upon <HI>Haut-Boys;</HI> and another &s;tringed In&s;trument, play'd on by a Moor: Between which we could conceive no manner of Harmony. Before him al&s;o was carried upon a pole, two Hor&s;es Tails, the Marks of his Dignity. At his Arrival the Port &s;aluted him with five Guns, and the <HI>Veivode, Caddi,</HI> and other chief Officers of the Town, came to the Gate at his Landing, to ki&s;s his Ve&s;t, and receive him with all the Re&s;pect they were capable to give him. So &s;oon as he was landed, he mounted on Hor&s;e-back, and was conducted to the <HI>Veivode</HI>'s Hou&s;e; the re&s;t accom|panying him on foot. The next day he clapped the <HI>Emir</HI> in Pri&s;on, in|&s;tead of his Brother, who had murdered one of the Town a great while ago: But he came off again for a Sum of Money; which was all the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> de&s;ir'd. The next day after he demanded fifty Hor&s;es of the <HI>Turks,</HI> fifty of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and thirty of the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> the&s;e being the lea&s;t Part of the Town.</P>
<P>The Wind being bad, we could not proceed by Sea; and our <HI>He|brew</HI> Ho&s;t &s;o frighted us with the danger of Robbers by Land, that our <HI>Greek</HI> refu&s;ed ab&s;olutely to go farther with us, unle&s;s by Water. For he was a kind of Water-man, and was not of their Faith, that had ra|ther tru&s;t God Almighty by Land, than by Sea. Yet he ha&s;tened us to be gone, &s;hewing us the Danger we were in, &s;taying there, and what Peril him&s;elf al&s;o ran for entertaining us. And to &s;peak the truth, we were no le&s;s willing to be gone, than he was to have us gone. For we found no great Encouragement, either in the Curio&s;ities of the Place, or his Entertainment, to make us &s;tay.</P>
<P>So, <HI>January</HI> the fifth, we took a Boat, and pa&s;&s;ed over to the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Morea,</HI> to attend there better Weather; which we did, till we were weary with attending, it being ten or twelve days time: For we had not the Honour to be lodged in the Ca&s;tle; no Chri&s;tians what&s;o|ever
<PB N="302" REF="119">being permitted to enter into it. But we were forced to make a vertue of Nece&s;&s;ity, and content our &s;elves, to take up our habita|tion in a place not much bigger or better than a Tomb, like the Mad|man mentioned in the Go&s;pel: Which was a Brick Building, arched over, of &s;ix foot broad, and fifteen foot long; and the Floor digg'd two foot deep below ground. It had two &s;uch holes, one a top, and another below, as would neither let out the Smoak, nor let in the Light: But cold enough. This Room &s;erved us for all the Offices of a &s;pacious Hou&s;e; the wor&s;t was, when it came to its turn to be made a Kitchin: not but that we might well enough have endured the Fire, if our Eyes could have agreed as well with the Smoak. Our Patron of the Barque lent us his Sail to &s;pread on the Floor; on which lay|ing our Quilts, we made but a bad &s;hift, the Place being very damp. But the Wetne&s;s producing good &s;tore of Ru&s;hes thereabouts, I taught them at la&s;t to be Matt-makers, by tying handfuls of long Ru&s;hes toge|ther, with Pack-thred we had by us. The&s;e we laid under our Quilts, and to &s;top out the Cold. The Fountain <HI>Argyra,</HI> of good fre&s;h Water at our Door, was our be&s;t Accommodation. For as to our Wine, we &s;ent for it two or three Miles off; our Bread we had from <HI>Patras;</HI> and our Meat from the Mountains, at about a Mile or two's di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>One day, to take the Air, I went to the Mountains, with our <HI>Greek,</HI> and a Guide, to get Provi&s;ions; and having pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome Flocks, not above two Miles from us; not finding the Shepherds with them, we began to a&s;cend the foot of the Mountain; and being gat up upon a Hill, at a good di&s;tance we &s;aw thirty or forty, &s;itting in a round heap toge|ther. This made me pre&s;ently to call to mind the plea&s;ant Stories I had heard of the <HI>Arcadian</HI> Shepherds, from who&s;e Country we were now not far di&s;tant: I thought of nothing, but being diverted by &s;ome Fe|&s;tival, &s;ome Sport or other among them; or, at lea&s;t, that there had been the Nuptials of &s;ome fair Shepherde&s;s, then celebrated: At which the Shepherds being weary of dancing, were now &s;et down to enter|tain them&s;elves with the noble Wine of the Country, a fat Lamb of their Flocks, or with &s;ome Ru&s;tick Sonnets, and old Wives Tales. But ap|proaching nearer, I was &s;oon undeceiv'd; finding an old Grey-bearded <HI>Turk,</HI> &s;itting in the middle of the Circle, like a Conjurer, with his Lap full of Pebles, Pen, Ink, and Paper by him, and giving each of them their Task; which was to turn five of tho&s;e Stones into &s;o many Dollers, by the next day at that time, upon pain of being made Slaves, and &s;ent chain|ed to the Gallies, if they failed. This was for their <HI>Caratch,</HI> or <HI>Poll|money.</HI> There were other Accounts al&s;o to be made up among them. For their Flocks are not their own, but the <HI>Grand Signiors;</HI> of which they have the tenth Part of the Profit, and Fruit for their Labour; paying the other Duties that are impo&s;ed upon them. The number of Pebles that were then to be made Dollers, was Four hundred and thirteen; by a People, that I dare engage, knew nothing of the <HI>Philo&s;o|pher</HI>'s <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>Their manner of living there, is in little Hutts, made of long Sedge; which they joyn together with Sticks, and Withs, in &s;uch &s;ort, that a Covering of the&s;e keeps off the Rain from the top; and as for the Wind,
<PB N="303" REF="119">as that changeth, &s;o they turn their Doors to the Lee of it; making a Fire before it. The&s;e are their Winter Hou&s;es, when they are forced from the tops of the Mountains covered with Snow, into the Valleys. For in the Summer they have Villages they live in, upon the Mountains; and there with greater &s;ecurity feed their Sheep, and witner in the&s;e little Hutts; therein crowding them&s;elves, and Wives, and Children toge|ther.</P>
<P>Their Habit is ordinarily made of White Cloth, of the cour|&s;er Wool of their Flocks; being a large Cloak, with a Hood of the &s;ame joyned to it, and hanging down behind, or to cover their Heads with, when they have occa&s;ion: For ordinarily, on their Heads, they wear a kind of Hat, made of Wool, in which their Hoods enter not; but is flat, and &s;its clo&s;e to their Heads, having a good big Knob on the top, and tied under their Chin with long &s;trings, like a Cardinal's Cap; by which, when they plea&s;e, they can let it hang on their Shoul|ders, and put on their Hood. Their Under-garment is commonly a Fu&s;tian Shirt, made &s;o wide, that they let it hang &s;ometimes quite on the out&s;ide their Breeches.</P>
<P>The Women have a very odd kind of dre&s;s for their Heads; be|ing a half Circle, or <HI>Cre&s;cent,</HI> of Tin or Bra&s;s, &s;et an end upon their Heads; with a Girdle about their Middle of the &s;ame Metal, compo|&s;ed of many Scales of Bra&s;s; which is girded about &s;uch a Linnen Garment, as the Men wear; but longer, and embroidered with red Yarn about the Neck, Sleeves, and Bottom. Their Shooes are only dried Skins, laced together with Leather, or Strings, about their Feet. Having made our Market, we returned with more Melancholy, than Satisfaction, to &s;ee the&s;e poor Chri&s;tians in &s;o mi&s;erable a Condition; bringing with us a very good fat Sheep for five Timins; that is, about two Shillings: which was a Groat more, than is u&s;ual to pay there for them.</P>

<P>After a very &s;tormy Night, twelfth day in the Morning, &s;o &s;oon as we opened the Door of our Hou&s;e, we found one of the&s;e &s;orts of Fowls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PELICANS</NOTE> we call <HI>Pelicans,</HI> the Modern <HI>Greeks, Toubana:</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> thinks the &s;ame, that <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Onocrotalus.</HI> Whether benummed with cold, or that it had been &s;hot, I know not; but we ea&s;ily caught it with Stones. It hath a Body as big as a Swan; but the Neck not &s;o long: the Feet webbed, and is of a grey colour, like a common Goo&s;e. We mea&s;ured the Beak of this to be &s;eventeen Inches long; broad in the large&s;t part, an Inch and half; from the Beak to the Crown of the Head, five Inches. The end of the Beak turneth into a &s;harp Hook, which, perhaps, helps it to catch Fi&s;h. The under part of the Beak is proportionable to the upper in length; and breadth al&s;o, when it is &s;hut together: but when it openeth, it enlargeth it &s;o, that it becom|eth, as I gue&s;s, half a foot wide; it being of a bending &s;ub&s;tance, much like a Whale's Bone; and the two Jaws of it joyned together at the end, as if it was but one piece bent together. To this, near to the en|trance of the Throat, is joyned a bag, of a skinny &s;ub&s;tance, like a Blad|der before it is blown; which &s;hrinketh it &s;elf &s;o much together, that it is not &s;een, when the Mouth is &s;hut, or the Bag empty: but when filled, it will &s;tretch to an incredible bigne&s;s. When it was dead, we tied a &s;tring about the Throat, that no Water could pa&s;s down the Belly, and tried how much Water this Bag would hold. We had a wooden Kan there, who&s;e Dimen&s;ions were the&s;e:

<P>Five of the&s;e <HI>Kans</HI> of Water we put into the Bag; u&s;ing no other Art
<PB N="305" REF="120">to make it &s;tretch, than meerly the weight of the Water, as we filled it: which I verily judge to have been in the whole, no le&s;s than ten or a dozen Quarts. After this we opened it, and found the Throat down to the Brea&s;t, large enough to &s;wallow a Carp of a foot long; thence to the Gizzard, but &s;mall. The Gizzard is not of a round fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, as other Fowls; but near half a Foot long, and an Inch and Quarter <HI>Diameter;</HI> of a thicker &s;ub&s;tance, than the re&s;t of the Guts, before or after. The Lungs of a skinny Sub&s;tance, &s;ticking fa&s;t on each &s;ide to the Ribs; but a little red. In its Gizzard were many live, &s;mall Worms; which I know not, whether it were his Meat, or his Di&s;ea&s;e. The Blood and Fle&s;h were very black; and therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e, very bad Meat. They are in va&s;t numbers all about the&s;e Seas, as well as at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;ay, With the&s;e Bags they carry Fi&s;h, and Water to their Young Ones in the Mountains, where they breed.</P>
<P>Another day, walking abroad, I found one of tho&s;e <HI>Tree-Froggs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TREE-FROGGS.</NOTE> which I met with, and only mentioned, at <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> call it <HI>Spordaca.</HI> Both of tho&s;e, which I &s;aw, were &s;mall in &s;hape, like o|thers; but of a deep green colour, like a green Wallnut; and when it lies clo&s;e to the Ground, re&s;embles the better half of a Wall-nut ly|ing flat. For then it doubleth its Feet &s;o clo&s;e under it, that it &s;eem|eth one entire piece. The Nature of this <HI>Frogg</HI> is much different from that of others: For tho&s;e delight to be &s;till on the Ground among Gra&s;s, or in the Water; whereas this kind delights to climb Trees, Bu&s;hes, and Shrubs, and to &s;it chirping upon them. For which purpo&s;e al&s;o Na|ture hath made Provi&s;ion; its Toes ending in a little round Knob, like a Pins-head; out of which i&s;&s;ueth &s;uch a clammy Sub&s;tance, that leap|ing from Bough to Bough, like a Squirrel, where&s;oever it toucheth with any of its Feet, it hangeth, and gets up its whole Body, as I often tried. I did not perceive, that it held by gra&s;ping with its Feet, as Birds and Squirrels do; but only &s;ticking, by that clammy Sub&s;tance, to the &s;moothe&s;t Leaves. I kept one &s;everal days with us, upon a Bough of <HI>Lenti&s;cus,</HI> &s;ticking the Bough into the Wall. I put it into the Water, and found it would &s;wim like other Frogs; but made all the ha&s;te ima|ginable, to be out of that colder Element, and never offered to dive under Water at all. To &s;ee how it will recover it &s;elf by one Foot, touching a Bough or Leaf, is very wonderful, and almo&s;t pa&s;t Be|lief.</P>
<P>From the Mountains here run down many Streams, and pa&s;s into the Sea, within the Gulph. And between <HI>Patras,</HI> and the Promontory <HI>Dre|panum,</HI> which is within the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto, Pau&s;anias</HI> mentions four Rivers, and a Fountain; but &s;omewhat confu&s;edly for want of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing which are without, and which are within the Promontory <HI>Rhion.</HI> The fir&s;t is the River <HI>Milichus,</HI> which I &s;pake of already at <HI>Patras,</HI> which ri&s;eth among the Hills behind the Town, and falleth into the Sea South-We&s;twards of it. The next is the River <HI>Charadrus,</HI> which I place within the Promontory <HI>Rhion,</HI> becau&s;e I ob&s;erved no Stream between <HI>Patras,</HI> and the Ca&s;tles, and the Fountain <HI>Argyra,</HI> which is with|in the Ca&s;tles next following it. To this River <HI>Charadrus,</HI> the Coun|try round about u&s;ed to bring their Cattle in the Spring to drink, be|lieving
<PB N="306" REF="121">that their Young Ones would be much the larger for it. The Fountain <HI>Argyra,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, is that which I mentioned within the Pro|montory <HI>Rhion,</HI> or the Ca&s;tles, about a Mile, near the little Hut, I &s;aid, we &s;taid at &s;o long, expecting a Wind. And the River <HI>Selemnus,</HI> one of tho&s;e Streams next to it, which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, The <HI>Patra&s;&s;ians</HI> be|lieved, would cure tho&s;e in Love, that wa&s;hed them&s;elves therein: Which was the Gift of <HI>Venus</HI> to it, pitying the Shepherd <HI>Selemnus,</HI> for|&s;aken by the incon&s;tant Nymph <HI>Argyra,</HI> when his Blooming Youth be|gan to decay. Next to this, he mentions the River <HI>Bolinaeus;</HI> the cha&s;te Nymph that gave Name to which, being pur&s;ued by <HI>Apollo,</HI> wilfully threw her &s;elf into the Sea head-long, to avoid his foul Em|braces.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that <HI>Terebinthus</HI> grows not large here, but bears Cods of <HI>Opobal&s;amum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARA|DRUM.</NOTE> There grows abundance of Myrtle here al&s;o, and a &s;ort of <HI>Iris,</HI> with Leaves like Gra&s;s, and a curious Azure-coloured Flower. The Wind continuing yet contrary, after eleven days &s;tay in this mi&s;e|rable Hole, we began to be &s;o weary, that we did not know how to di&s;po&s;e of our &s;elves: and con&s;idering what was to be done to deliver us from the&s;e tedious Pa&s;&s;ages by Sea, in which we found we had no good Fortune, we concluded to go back to M^r <HI>Pendarves</HI> at the Ship, and furni&s;h our &s;elves with &s;o much Money, as would carry us quite through <HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Vienna;</HI> where I ordered Letters of Credit to meet us. Therefore we made a Bargain with our Patron, <HI>Dervi&s;h Haly,</HI> to carry us thither. So we hoi&s;ed Sail, and came that Evening under the Mountain <HI>Galata,</HI> I before mentioned. Here we found another Barque, that had &s;taid eight days for the &s;ame Wind that we wanted, in a little Bay that &s;tands in the Lee under this Mountain: from which i&s;&s;ueth a Spring of very good fre&s;h Water. The <HI>Greeks</HI> call it <HI>Crio Nero,</HI> or the <HI>Cold Water:</HI> for they &s;ay, It is very cold in the Sum|mer. Perhaps this was, in former Times, the <HI>Callirrhoe</HI> of the An|tients.</P>

<P>Though it began to be dark, I made &s;hift to clamber up the &s;ide to the Rock, and gathered a bundle of Herbs; among which, when I came into the Barque, I found a kind of Spurge I had not before &s;een. It is a Shrub, that groweth in a &s;mall round Bu&s;h of a Foot high, &s;pread|ing infinitely into Branches, until it bends every way down to the Ground, and is every way guarded with Bunches of Thorns at the top: among which &s;pring up young tender Branches, full of &s;mall Leaves, &s;haped like <HI>Hypericon,</HI> full of Milk; and on the top, Knots of Flowers, like the other <HI>Tithymaus;</HI> the Stems of which I judge to grow hard, and turn into Thorns. This I &s;aw afterwards in many Parts of <HI>Greece,</HI> in the Plains of <HI>Athens,</HI> and on the <HI>I&s;thmus.</HI> There groweth <HI>Fu&s;t</HI> al|&s;o, or <HI>Yellow-wood,</HI> u&s;ed to dye with; called by the <HI>Greeks, Chry&s;oxu|lo,</HI> or <HI>Golden-wood.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning early, we came to the Ship to M^r <HI>Pendarves;</HI> where having di&s;patched our bu&s;ine&s;s, we refre&s;hed our &s;elves, and the next day, the Wind favouring of us, we cro&s;&s;ed over to <HI>Patras.</HI> This time we found S^r <HI>Clement Harby,</HI> the Con&s;ul of the <HI>Morea</HI> there; who entertained us very civilly at his Hou&s;e, and &s;hewed us many things we had not &s;een at our fir&s;t being there, as I &s;aid before. Of him we had a new Pa&s;s-port; and &s;taying &s;everal days in his Hou&s;e, we had almo&s;t concluded with him, to have fir&s;t made the Tour of <HI>Morea.</HI> But the Wind at la&s;t changing South-We&s;t, which was for our turn to pa&s;s into the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> taking Hor&s;es, we ha&s;ted to the Ca&s;tles, and made a Bargain with the &s;ame Ma&s;ter of the Barque, for eight Dollers, to car|ry us to <HI>Salona.</HI> From <HI>Patras</HI> to the Ca&s;tles, we pa&s;&s;ed through a Val|ley well planted with Olive-trees, and a pretty Village about midway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIKIDA. SCIESSA.</NOTE> called <HI>Sikida;</HI> perhaps it is where <HI>Solinus</HI> mentions <HI>Scie&s;&s;a,</HI> remarkable
<PB N="308" REF="122">only for &s;uch &s;hady Hills, as the Sun could hardly pa&s;s through. But we found nothing of the Temple of <HI>Neptune,</HI> which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> puts in the mid-way, nor any other Antiquity. From <HI>Patras</HI> to the Ca&s;tles, they account it nine Miles; but it cannot be above &s;ix or &s;even of our Miles: which al&s;o agreeth with <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his fifty <HI>Stadia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the nineteenth of <HI>January</HI> 1675/6, in the Evening we parted from the Ca&s;tles, and left about three Miles thence at our right hand, a ruined Village, called <HI>Drepano,</HI> near to a Cape, called antiently <HI>Dre|panum</HI> by <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> and <HI>Strabo:</HI> But <HI>Ptolomy</HI> &s;eemeth to confound it with <HI>Rhium,</HI> and calleth it <HI>Trepanum,</HI> which without doubt, is that by the Ca&s;tle, making the narrowe&s;t <HI>Streight</HI> between it &s;elf, and <HI>Antirrhi|um,</HI> the oppo&s;ite Promontory in the Confines of <HI>Aetolia,</HI> and <HI>Locris;</HI> which are counted by <HI>Strabo,</HI> not above five <HI>Stadia</HI> di&s;tant from each other. This Promontory was called <HI>Drepanum,</HI> becau&s;e the Sea maketh a Bay betweeen <HI>Rhium</HI> and it, fa&s;hioned like a reaping Hook or Sickle; which &s;ignifies &s;o much in <HI>Greek.</HI> And moreover they fan&s;ied. that <HI>Sa|turn</HI> of old time did ca&s;t his Sickle there, to make it. From <HI>Drepanum,</HI> further in the Continent, is a Town called <HI>Aderna;</HI> and further, near the Sea, another called <HI>Vo&s;titza.</HI> The Wind continuing good, we made &s;ail all night with a very gentle Gale; and in the Morning found our &s;elves at the Promontory, entring the Bay at <HI>Salona,</HI> now by the <HI>Greeks</HI> called Cape <HI>P&s;aroumatia,</HI> or Fi&s;hes-eye. This Bay was antiently called <HI>Sinus Cri&s;&s;aeus;</HI> and though <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;eemeth to call the whole Gulph &s;o in many Places, yet in his Eight Book he maketh the <HI>Sinus Cri&s;&s;aeus</HI> to begin from this Place; and all, from the <HI>Antirrhium</HI> to the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> to be the <HI>Mare Alcyonum:</HI> which yet &s;ometimes he al&s;o makes part of the <HI>Sinus Cri&s;&s;aeus.</HI> I doubt this Place of his, is not very correct. But by comparing the &s;everal Places together, I believe, he meant thus: That the <HI>Sinus Corinthiacus</HI> begins at the <HI>Arrexius</HI> Promontory, and the River <HI>Achelous;</HI> That from <HI>Rhium</HI> and <HI>Antirrhium,</HI> it was called <HI>Mare Alcyonum;</HI> of which <HI>Sinus Cri&s;&s;aeus</HI> was really a part, and not <HI>vice vers&acirc;,</HI> the <HI>Mare Alcyonum</HI> a part of it. For he &s;aith expre&s;ly, that <HI>Sinus Cri&s;|&s;aeus</HI> begins at this <HI>Streight:</HI> Yet in another place he calls the Northern Bay, at the further end of the Gulph al&s;o, more peculiarly, <HI>Mare Al|cyonum;</HI> and that it was called <HI>Sinus Cri&s;&s;aeus,</HI> or <HI>Cri&s;&s;aicus, from a Town at the bottom of this Bay;</HI> as there is one there, yet bearing the name of <HI>Cri&s;&s;a.</HI> I found our modern Maps very erroneous, both in the natu|ral Situation of the Gulph it &s;elf, as of the Places about it. I therefore have endeavoured to make one of this, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e Parts of <HI>Greece</HI> I &s;aw, according to my own Ob&s;ervations; which you may con|&s;ult, as you read</P>
<P>Wherefore turning this Cape, and keeping along the Shore, at our left hand, we pa&s;&s;ed two little Bays, and came to the Ruins of a Town, called by the <HI>Greeks, Pentagi.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PENTAGI.</NOTE> It may probably have been that, which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> calleth <HI>Panthea;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PANTHEA.</NOTE> which, he &s;aith, was between <HI>Amphi&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Naupactus;</HI> and &s;aith only, That it had a Temple dedicated to <HI>Venus,</HI> and another to <HI>Diana,</HI> in a thick Grove of Cypre&s;s, and Pine-trees. The Foundations of the Town remain on a little <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> almo&s;t en|compa&s;&s;ed with two little Bays; in the middle of which is a little Church; wherein we found a little Altar, or el&s;e the <HI>Pede&s;tal</HI> of a Statue; with

<P>Near this we &s;aw &s;everal Caves, or Grottoes, hewen out of the Rocks: among the re&s;t, one that had &s;erved for a Sepulcher, with five Parti|tions, for &s;o many Bodies to lie in: Which they call the Sepulcher of <HI>Pentagi,</HI> or <HI>Five Saints;</HI> from whence the Place taketh its pre&s;ent Name.</P>

<P N="3">3. Another Plant I &s;aw like <HI>Lamium;</HI> it was but young and tender All that I ob&s;erved about it was this, <HI>viz.</HI> that from a tender and &s;tringy Root, ri&s;eth a quadrangular Stalk, &s;et at &s;everal di&s;tances with Leaves, upon a long <HI>&s;trig</HI> or <HI>&s;tem,</HI> like <HI>Dead Nettle,</HI> with white Flowers; but
<PB N="310" REF="123">cut at the Edges with rounder Niches.

Wherefore I called it <HI>Lamium Mo&s;chatum,</HI> becau&s;e I find it not de&s;cribed by any other.</P>
<P>The next day we came to the bottom of this Bay of <HI>Salona,</HI> in le&s;s than two hours time; where we were made to pay a Doller a Head for our Welcom on the <HI>Grecian</HI> Shore, by an Infidel that called him&s;elf, <HI>Receivour of the Cu&s;toms;</HI> although we a&s;&s;ured him, that we were not Merchants; and our due being only to pay <HI>Five A&s;pers:</HI> but of that we were inform'd, when it was too late. Upon this Rocky Shore I ob|&s;erved <HI>Spurge</HI> to grow in Trees, with Bodies half a foot <HI>Diameter;</HI> and wild Almond-trees, then in flower.</P>
<P>Here we took Hor&s;es, which we found upon their Return to <HI>Salona;</HI> and fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed over a rocky Hill, that led us down into a fertil Plain, well planted with Corn, and Olive-trees; which I &s;uppo&s;e to be that, was called <HI>The happy Plain of Cri&s;&s;a:</HI> for it lieth under <HI>Cri&s;&s;a,</HI> which we left upon a Hill on our right hand, about a Mile and half, or two Miles from the Sea towards Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us:</HI> thence going through a <HI>Streight,</HI> between a Hill on which <HI>Cri&s;&s;a</HI> &s;tands, on the right hand, and Rocks on the left, brought us into another fair Valley, well planted, till'd, and water'd with a Stream, running through the middle of it, which I &s;uppo&s;e, meets with the <HI>Plei&s;tus,</HI> &s;omewhere between <HI>Cri&s;&s;a,</HI> and the Sea; and from thence, into the Bay of <HI>Salona.</HI> This Valley is but nar|row, being bounded by the Mountain <HI>Corax</HI> South-We&s;t, and by the Ridges of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> North-Ea&s;t; and after eight or ten Miles riding from Sea, this Valley brought us by Noon to <HI>Salona.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Salona</HI> is &s;ituated upon a Rock in the inmo&s;t Rece&s;s of this Valley, un|der a high Mountain Northwards;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SALONA, or AMPHISSA</NOTE> unto which <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> &s;tretcheth out a Ridge on one hand, as al&s;o does Mount <HI>Corax</HI> on the other. On the top of this Rock is the Ca&s;tle, and about it is the Town. The number of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> here, are about equal. It is a Bi&s;hoprick, &s;ub|ject to the Metropolitan of <HI>Athens;</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> have here &s;ix Churches.

We &s;aw nothing remarkable of Antiquity here; only a <HI>Roman</HI> Eagle, well cut in Mar|ble. Some have thought this to be the antient <HI>Delphos;</HI> as <HI>Niger,</HI> and <HI>Baudron,</HI> from him. But becau&s;e this agreed not with the <HI>Idea</HI> we had of the Situation of that Place; we made &s;trict enquiry, whether there were no old Stones with writing upon them, about the Town; and at la&s;t we heard of one, at a Church on the &s;ide of the Mountain, a quar|ter of a Mile above the Town; which we went up to &s;ee. The Church is called <HI>Sotiros Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> being dedicated to the <HI>Transfiguration</HI> of our Saviour. But the poor <HI>Pappa</HI> &s;eeing us come in our <HI>Turki&s;h Habit,</HI> was &s;o frighted, that he ran, and hid him&s;elf among the Rocks.

Moreover, our In&s;cription, which is of later Date, &s;hews it to have been again inhabited. It had its Name from the Nymph <HI>Amphi&s;&s;a,</HI> with whom <HI>Apollo</HI> had to do: and her Monument was the chief Ornament of the Town: Next to which, that of <HI>Andremon,</HI> and his Wife <HI>Gorga,</HI> had the Preheminence. <HI>Minerva</HI> had a Temple in the Ca&s;tle, which is the &s;ame the <HI>Turks</HI> now have; and her Image was thought by the Inhabitants, to have been brought from <HI>Troy.</HI> But <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> a great Judge in the&s;e Antiquities, thought it rather from the Rude|ne&s;s of the Work, to be of <HI>Rhoecus,</HI> and <HI>Theodorus</HI> of <HI>Samos</HI> his doing; who fir&s;t taught the Art of Founding Metals, but were not accounted the mo&s;t excellent Workmen.

And indeed it would be a wonder, could they accommodate all their Gods to be the &s;ame under &s;o diffe|rent Names, Stories, Birth-places, Sepulchers, and Circum&s;tances; when from their different Names, they were all rather to be judged different Per&s;ons; proper Names being u&s;ually the &s;ame in all Languages, with &s;ome &s;mall difference.

<P>This night we lodged with a <HI>Greek,</HI> called <HI>Georgaki Andreno.</HI> We had a Letter from <HI>Signior Samuel</HI> of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> to a <HI>Turk,</HI> called <HI>Maho|met Ba&s;ha,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Tuni&s;ino,</HI> from the Place he came from: But he not being at home, a Relation of his &s;ent us to an hone&s;t, and merry <HI>Greek;</HI> who made us all the welcome he could, and provided us a Sup|per, not ungrateful to our travelling Stomachs. But we had like to have over-&s;awc'd it with Wine; for out good Ho&s;t would not let the Bowl &s;tand &s;till; it being the <HI>Greek</HI> Mode to make the Cup go round without cea&s;ing: Nor was it Manners on our &s;ide to refu&s;e it, or call for Wine out of our turns.</P>
<PB N="313" REF="124">
<P>Being now well a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>Salona</HI> was not <HI>Delphos,</HI> but the <HI>Am|phi&s;&s;a</HI> of old; we enquired of our Ho&s;t, whether there were no anti|ent Ruins of a Town in our way between this and <HI>Livadia?</HI> He told us, That there were many at <HI>Ca&s;tri,</HI> a Village about mid-way: So we &s;pake with &s;everal Janizaries to conduct us thither, and thence to <HI>Li|vadia</HI> and <HI>Thebes.</HI> But not agreeing upon the Price, we took the Bro|ther of <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;ha,</HI> and parted very early next Morning. For Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI>'s going into the Water at the Fountain, above the Town, had made &s;ome of the <HI>Turks</HI> to murmur, and to &s;u&s;pect us to be Spies.</P>
<P>A little way from the Town we foorded a Brook, which joyns with the other Stream in the Plain; but are both near lo&s;t in watering them, before they come to the Sea. After a Mile or two Riding, we looked about, and &s;aw another <HI>Janizary</HI> following us, of tho&s;e we had &s;poken to over night: which we were re&s;olved to keep al&s;o; thinking, until we were better acquainted with the Country, we could not be too &s;e|cure. So we were now eight &s;trong; <HI>viz.</HI> our two Janizaries, our <HI>Greek,</HI> our three <HI>Hagoiaties,</HI> or Guides, who were the owners of our Hor&s;es, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon,</HI> and my &s;elf. We &s;oon began to mount the Ridges of the Mountain <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> by a very bad rough way, South-Ea&s;twards, until we arrived, in four or five Hours time, at <HI>Ca&s;tri;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CASTRI.

<P>I need not tell you what this Place was in antient times: All the World knows, how famous <HI>Delphos</HI> hath been for the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> there, con&s;ulted for &s;o many Ages together. But its antient Glory is now vani&s;hed; and it remains Great, at pre&s;ent, only in the Writings of the Antients. Before we entred within the Compa&s;s of the (former) Ci|ty, we ob&s;erved &s;everal Grottoes cut in the Rocks, with &s;everal Par|titions, as we conceived, to bury the Dead; as believing, that the an|tient Sanctity, and Re&s;pect had to this Place, would not permit to bury the Dead within the Walls; no more than at <HI>Delos,</HI> the other fa|mous Oracle of <HI>Apollo.</HI> Mounting a little higher, by a way cut out of the Rocks, we entred through a Pa&s;&s;age, where we thought the antient Gates might have been: from whence we &s;aw the Town of <HI>Ca&s;tri</HI> hard by; and de&s;cending thence a little further, we went into a Church on the right hand, called S^t <HI>Helias;</HI> where we found the la&s;t, and &s;ome other pieces of white Marble, with In&s;criptions on them. At the Door of this Church is another great Stone, with &s;ome Lines of an In&s;cription, which we copied as well as we could, and where I thought, that I read the Name of <HI>Delphos</HI> again. This &s;eems to be the Place mo&s;t like|ly for the Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> to have been &s;ituated in; although now no
<PB N="315" REF="125">Remains of it are to be found: only <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, That it was in the upper Part of the City. It is true, there is a Rock yet higher, North-We&s;t of this, beyond the <HI>Stadium.</HI> But there is no room for &s;uch a Temple to be built there, nor any manner of antient Remains on it; but where this Church is built, the Ground lieth higher than the re&s;t, and &s;quare, having the Foundations of a Wall, built of hewen Stone, and towards the De&s;cent of the Hill &s;upported by Buttrices; but to|wards the way-&s;ide, even with the Ground. Not far from this are &s;e|veral Antient pieces of Walls, with arched, and old vaulted Places.</P>
<P>A little further on the left hand of the way, is the Place, where a <HI>Stadium</HI> hath been; and &s;ome of the Degrees yet remain of white Mar|ble. It is much le&s;s, than that of <HI>Athens;</HI> although both had the &s;ame Founder, viz. <HI>Herodes Atticus.</HI> The <HI>Stadium</HI> hath the high Rock I la&s;t &s;pake of, at one Corner We&s;t of it; towards which are &s;everal Grot|toes and Caves hewn out of it, I &s;uppo&s;e, for Sepulchers, as well as tho&s;e we &s;aw, coming into the Town. This way led us a little more for|ward, by an ea&s;ie De&s;cent, to the Inhabited Parts of <HI>Ca&s;tri;</HI> and we alighted at a large Hou&s;e, that &s;erved for a <HI>Kan,</HI> or Place of Entertain|ment, to Pa&s;&s;engers. This Town con&s;i&s;ts of not above Two hundred Hou&s;es, and tho&s;e very ill built. The <HI>Turks</HI> are not above a dozen in number, and have one <HI>Mo&s;que.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> have five or &s;ix Churches, and &s;eem very good People, though poor; and were very civil to us. The little Trade they have, is in Cotton and Tabaco; and their Wine is exceeding good. <HI>Ca&s;tri</HI> belongeth to a <HI>Timar,</HI> called <HI>Abd-Haga,</HI> who liveth at <HI>Salona. Timarlicks</HI> are a kind of <HI>Fee-farms,</HI> that belong to the <HI>Grand Signior:</HI> and tho&s;e that hold them of him, are obliged to &s;erve him in the War, according to their Revenue.</P>
<P>After Noon we went through the Town to the Fountain, we knew to be <HI>Ca&s;talia,</HI> by <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his De&s;cription of it; who coming the way contrary to us, to wit, from the <HI>Gymna&s;ium,</HI> and <HI>Boeotia</HI> wards, left it at his right hand. It is ju&s;t in the Cleft of the Rocks, as I &s;aid before, hanging over it with a high Precipice. In this Rock, above the Foun|tain, is a kind of little Chapel, dedicated to S^t <HI>John;</HI> and above that thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Niches for Statues; one great one in the middle, and two le&s;&s;er on each &s;ide. In this Cleft, about nine or ten Yards high, is a hole; which by throwing Stones into it, we found to have Water in it: and on the right hand I ob&s;erved &s;ome Stairs, leading up to it, cut out of the Rock; but &s;o broken, that there was no clambering up. We judg|ed this to be the <HI>Antrum Corycium,</HI> or the Grotto of the Nymphs, the Poets called by that Name. I believe this makes a fine <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> when there is Water enough falling from the Mountains. The Water of <HI>Ca&s;ta|lia</HI> is very good and cool; fit to quench the Thir&s;t of tho&s;e hot-headed Poets, who, in their <HI>Bacchanals,</HI> &s;pare neither God nor Man; and to whom nothing is &s;o &s;acred, but they will venture to profane it.</P>
<P>Continuing yet upon a De&s;cent, we came to a Mona&s;tery, called <HI>Pa|nagia,</HI> its Church being dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. It is &s;ituated upon the Brink of the Mountain, upon ground, held up by antient, &s;trong Walls of hewn Stone. There we &s;aw &s;everal Capitals, and Fu&s;ts, of <HI>Co|rinthian</HI> Pillars, and other Fragments of Antiquity; among which three or four In&s;criptions, in and about the Church, and the Name of <HI>Delphos,</HI>
<PB N="316" REF="126">with only the&s;e words in the Pavement of the Church,
&Dgr;&Egr;&Lgr;&PHgr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Pgr;&OHgr;&Lgr;&Egr;&OHgr;&Sgr; &Agr;&Pgr; &Egr;&Lgr;&Egr;&Ugr;&THgr;&Egr;&Rgr;&Ogr;&Ugr;.
Others we copied there al&s;o, which I re&s;erve for another occa&s;ion. Here are not above three or four <HI>Caloy|ers,</HI> belonging to this Mona&s;tery; who brought us of their Bread, and very good White Wine. We wondered, that one of them knew, that this Place was antiently called <HI>Delphos;</HI> which he told us, he found by &s;ome Book he had read: For it is not u&s;ual, that they know any thing of the Hi&s;tory of their Country. But he was much plea&s;ed, when we &s;hewed him the Name written in his Church. We believed, that this Place was where the <HI>Gymna&s;ium,</HI> or Schools &s;tood, from <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his words: <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that go up from the</HI> Gymna&s;ium <HI>to the Temple, have the Fountain</HI> Ca&s;talia <HI>on the right hand.</HI> But we, bending our Steps contrary to his, ought to leave it, as we did, on our left hand. Thence is a great Precipice, in which the River <HI>Plei&s;tos</HI> runneth; which <HI>Pau&s;a|nias</HI> makes three <HI>Stadia,</HI> or about Four hundred Paces below: Into which, what the Town and Gardens can &s;pare of <HI>Ca&s;talia,</HI> de&s;cends in|to it. Returning by the Fountain, we ob&s;erved a great piece of the Rock tumbled down, and almo&s;t buried: on one &s;ide of it, that lay a little hollow, we &s;aw Letters written in large, but &s;trange Characters, &s;o as we could not make any thing of them.</P>
<P>We returned to our lodging very well plea&s;ed with our days labour, although weary with rambling up and down upon tho&s;e Rocks. Being returned, whil&s;t Supper was making ready, I began to put my Plants I had gathered, in order into my Book; among the re&s;t I found one, which was &s;omething like <HI>narrow leav'd Buglo&s;s,</HI> in &s;hape and manner of growing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS. of PARNASSUS.</NOTE> the leaves long, cri&s;ped, and rough, growing one above another upon a Stalk of a foot high. Between each leaf is a yellow Flower, like <HI>Buglo&s;s</HI> in &s;hape; which is followed by &s;eeds, five toge|ther in the bottom of a Cup. The whole Plant is &s;o vi&s;cous, or clam|my, that it &s;ticketh to ones fingers, and is of a very &s;trong &s;weet &s;mell, like <HI>Narci&s;&s;us junei folio;</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Junculle. Mon&s;ieur Merchant,</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> called this, <HI>Stachys</HI> Vi&s;co&s;a, <HI>flore luteo.</HI> In the Cleft of the Rocks I found another Plant, with a leaf &s;omething like <HI>Py|rola,</HI> which he called <HI>Petromarula Gretica,</HI> or <HI>Lactuca petraea.</HI></P>
<P>The be&s;t, and readie&s;t way from hence to <HI>Livadia</HI> is, to pa&s;s by the Fountain <HI>Ca&s;talia,</HI> by the Mona&s;tery; and &s;o &s;till keeping under the Mountains, between <HI>Cirphis</HI> and <HI>Parna&s;&s;us;</HI> for thus it is but half a Days journey from <HI>Delphos</HI> to <HI>Livadia.</HI> But we could not pa&s;s by this Mountain, &s;o celebrated by the Poets, without pa&s;&s;ing over it to &s;ee what Beauties tho&s;e really were, they &s;o much commend in it. And therefore we took our Guide we had the Day before; who willingly offered us his &s;ervice, being well acquainted with this Mountain, and a fellow naturally ingenious, as mo&s;t of the Greeks are. We pa&s;&s;ed between the <HI>Stadium,</HI> and the Clefts above the Town, and pre&s;ently began to mount, making many turns backward and forward, to get a little ground in height. But I being light, made no great matter of it, chu&s;ing rather to go on foot, and have my Hor&s;e led, than to venture my Neck by a &s;tumble. So cro&s;&s;ing all the ways, I had often time to &s;it down, before my Comrades came to me, to view the Plains of <HI>Salona,</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto</HI> below me. The way is, in &s;ome places, cut
<PB N="317" REF="126">into Stairs, in the Rock; which &s;eem very antient. I ob&s;erved al&s;o a kind of Chanel cut in the Rock, in a &s;treight Line downwards; which, I believe, hath been an <HI>Aqueduct;</HI> but now &s;poiled. We were a long Hour, before we got to the Top; whereon is a pretty large Plain. We turned to the right hand, to &s;ee the two Tops of the Mountain above <HI>Delphos;</HI> and from the We&s;tern one, I had an excellent Pro&s;pect over the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> the Mountains of <HI>Morea;</HI> and nearer the Gulph it &s;elf, South, South-We&s;t and We&s;t, until the Mountain <HI>Corax:</HI> and yet nearer hand, Mount <HI>Cirphis,</HI> now called <HI>Stiva,</HI> from a Mona|&s;tery that is on it, &s;o called. The height of this Top makes Mount <HI>Cir|phis</HI> look from hence like a Plain, on the Top, and is a kind of <HI>Cher|&s;one&s;us;</HI> the Bay of <HI>Salona</HI> being on one &s;ide of it, and another Bay called <HI>A&s;pro&s;piti,</HI> on the other &s;ide: of which, more hereafter.</P>
<P>Hence I took the Figure of the Bay of <HI>Salona,</HI> with all the I&s;lands in it; which &s;eem'd to lie before me like a Map. Between this, and the other Top, in view from <HI>Ca&s;tri,</HI> is a deep Precipice, where the Water runs down to <HI>Ca&s;talia.</HI> How large it may be within, I know not; yet I doubt not, but it may have room enough to be the <HI>Antrum Corycium.</HI> I conceiv'd, that <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Temple was not far from this Place; but I found no <HI>Remains</HI> of it any where. Here are now only &s;ome Shepherds Hutts; and the Place they call <HI>Alona.</HI> Turning back to our way-ward, we had the view of the highe&s;t Part of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> as high again as we had yet mounted: Towards which, we pa&s;&s;ed a high Hill, covered with tho&s;e kind of Pines I de&s;cribed on <HI>Olympus:</HI> where we &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed over, and &s;ometimes through Snow; and left a Lake on our left hand, made by the melting of the Snow and Rain. But beyond that is an extream high Point of the Mountain, all covered with Snow; which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;ay, is <HI>almo&s;t above the Clouds.</HI> It was on this Top, that it is &s;aid, <HI>Deucalion</HI> &s;aved him&s;elf, and his Wife <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> from the Flood that happened in his time: which Place of Retreat he found by the howling of Wolves; and therefore called the Town he built there, <HI>Lycoria.</HI> They call it now, as my Companion &s;aith, <HI>Lia|coura.</HI> I under&s;tood it <HI>Hiliocoro:</HI> and &s;hould have thought my &s;elf mi|&s;taken by the Article <GAP DESC="foreign">, but that he, who told it me, gave me the Rea|&s;on of its Name, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e it &s;hines &s;o bright afar off; like the Sun, which they call <HI>Hilios:</HI> adding the Termination <HI>Coro,</HI> to make it &s;igni|fie the <HI>the Village of the Sun.</HI> However it be, both the one, and the other retains &s;till &s;omething of the &s;ound of the old Name. On this Top of the Mountain, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, it was, that the <HI>Thyades</HI> &s;acrificed to <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Apollo,</HI> in&s;pired with a &s;acred Rage. We came to the foot of this high Top, through a large Valley of about four or five Miles com|pa&s;s, and re&s;ted our &s;elves at a Fountain they call <HI>Dro&s;inigo.</HI> It hath one of the plentifulle&s;t Sources of Water, I ever &s;aw; and is much to be wondred at, con&s;idering the height we were yet from the plain Ground. For although this is a Valley in re&s;pect to the Tops of the Mountains all about it, much higher than it; yet is it a Mountain in re&s;pect of <HI>Del|phes,</HI> and <HI>Delphos</HI> a Mountain in re&s;pect of the Plains of <HI>Cri&s;&s;a.</HI> Yet the Source of this Fountain boileth up continually a foot <HI>Diameter,</HI> and near a foot high, from the Surface of the re&s;t of the Water; and pre&s;ently maketh a little River, which goes, and di&s;charges it &s;elf into a Lake, made
<PB N="318" REF="127">by it, a quarter of a Mile di&s;tant, South-Ea&s;t of it, in the Plain. The Water of the Fountain <HI>Dro&s;inigo,</HI> is as good and cool, as that at <HI>Del|phos.</HI></P>
<P>Parting from this Fountain, we kept along its Stream, until we came to the Lake; which we &s;till kept on the right hand of us, till we came to the Ea&s;tern end of it. We could find no Pa&s;&s;age for the Water out of it, but one; being a Hole pierced through a great Rock, at the Ea&s;t end; which is backed with a high Hill. We perceiv'd no Water then to run through the Pa&s;&s;age, whereby it u&s;ed to run, being &s;top't with Dirt, and Bu&s;hes: But there was a &s;ufficient &s;ign, that it u&s;ed to run, when the Lake, through the melting of Snow, or rains, is fuller of Wa|ter. And, I believe, its ordinary Pa&s;&s;age is deeper under the Gravel, or at lea&s;t through it: For they &s;ay, It appeareth again below <HI>Delphos;</HI> and the Place, with the Rivulet it makes, they call <HI>Scizaliza.</HI> Were it not for &s;uch Subterraneous Pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e, the whole Valley would &s;oon be filled with Water, until it ran over the Tops of the Rocks, down upon <HI>Delphos.</HI> And, po&s;&s;ibly, it might be one natural Rea&s;on of that Deluge, or Flood, in <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s time; and that he could &s;ave him&s;elf only upon that highe&s;t Point of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> called antiently <HI>Lycoria.</HI> For indeed I e&s;teem this Mountain, not only the highe&s;t in all <HI>Greece;</HI> but one of the highe&s;t in all the World, and not inferiour to Mount <HI>Cenis</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Alpes.</HI> It is &s;een very plain from <HI>Corinth.</HI> But I cannot, with my Comrade, e&s;teem it eighty Miles di&s;tant, unle&s;s it were to be mea&s;ured by Land, over the Mountains and Valleys. For M^r <HI>Vernon,</HI> who took the Latitude both of <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Delphos,</HI> placeth this in Thir|ty eight Degrees, fifty Minutes; and the other in Thirty eight Degrees, fourteen Minutes: &s;o that the difference is only Thirty &s;ix Minutes La|titude. And for the Longitude, it is the &s;ame; it &s;tanding directly North of <HI>Corinth;</HI> which I took with a Compa&s;s, in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Co|rinth.</HI> So that by the common Calcule of <HI>Degrees</HI> and <HI>Minutes,</HI> it can|not be above &s;ix or &s;even and thirty Miles off, in a direct Line. But there are &s;uch high Mountains, and deep Valleys between, as may make it near as much more, for ought I know. But it is &s;een &s;o plain from thence, that if it had the advantage of being &s;eparated from other Mountains, I doubt not, that it would be &s;een further than Mount <HI>Athos.</HI></P>
<P>Rambling up and down the Rocks, to look over, and have a good Pro&s;pect, in which I &s;till took great plea&s;ure, I came at la&s;t to a place, where I could look down the mo&s;t prodigious Precipice I ever &s;aw be|tween this and Mount <HI>Cirphis.</HI></P>

<P>After this I returned, and came to the Brink of the Mountain, South-Ea&s;tward, which we de&s;cended, by a dangerous and &s;teep way; and in two hours, arrived at a Village called <HI>Aracovi,</HI> or <HI>Racovi;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">RACOVI, or ARACOVI.</NOTE> which is a|bout midway down on the &s;ide of the Mountain. This Village con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Albane&s;es</HI> only; no <HI>Turks,</HI> but a <HI>Sub-Ba&s;ha,</HI> that govern|eth them: and hath no <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> in it, but &s;everal Churches. The chief|e&s;t, and be&s;t is the <HI>Panagia,</HI> or the Church of the mo&s;t <HI>Holy Virgin;</HI> the others are dedicated to S^t <HI>George,</HI> S^t <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and S^t <HI>Nicolas;</HI> be&s;ide &s;ome &s;mall Chapels. The Women here wear round their Faces &s;mall pieces of Money; and likewi&s;e round their Neck and Arms: Their Hair combed back, and curiou&s;ly braided down their Backs; at the ends of which hang Ta&s;&s;els of Silver Buttons. The re&s;t of their Habit is a loo&s;e Ve&s;t of White Woollen. They are all Shepherds, and Shepher|de&s;&s;es, who feed their Sheep on the Mountains. We were lodged at a <HI>Greek</HI>'s Hou&s;e, called <HI>Barba-Demou,</HI> who treated us civilly; only he was hard put to it, to get Provi&s;ion for &s;o many of us. <HI>Barba</HI> is a word the <HI>Greeks,</HI> as well as the <HI>Italians,</HI> u&s;e for <HI>&V;nkle;</HI> but do al&s;o give it to antient Men, in honour to them.</P>
<P>In one Church we found &s;ome Fragments of Antiquity, <HI>viz.</HI> of Marble Pillars and <HI>Corinthian</HI> Capitals; which made us think, that this was a Place of &s;ome Antiquity. My Companion judges, it was that an|tiently called <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us,</HI> or otherwi&s;e <HI>Ambry&s;us.</HI> But he mu&s;t pardon me, if I am not of his Opinion. For I can neither find it to agree with <HI>Strabo,</HI> nor <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> who place <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us</HI> a great way di&s;tant from this <HI>Racovi.</HI> For <HI>Strabo,</HI> de&s;cribing the Maritime Places of <HI>Phocaea,</HI> not of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, as <HI>Lawrenbergius,</HI> and others, &s;eem to under|&s;tand him; and having &s;poken what he thought fit of <HI>Anticyrrha,</HI> and the Promontory <HI>Pharygion,</HI> comes at la&s;t to &s;peak of <HI>Mycus Portus,</HI> and &s;ays of it, That it is the <HI>la&s;t of the Phocaean Harbours,</HI> and lieth <HI>under the Helicon</HI> and <HI>A&s;cra;</HI> adding withal, That <HI>Aba, and Amphry&s;&s;us are not far from that Place.</HI> After which he beginneth to give an Account of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Towns, and fir&s;t of <HI>Daulis;</HI> &s;hewing, That it lieth Ea&s;t of <HI>Delphos:</HI> and then mentioning part of a Ver&s;e in <HI>Homer,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he &s;aith, That &s;ome interpret tho&s;e words of the Poet, of the Cypre&s;s Trees, and others of a Village under <HI>Lycoria,</HI> bearing that Name. Now <HI>Lycoria</HI> being the highe&s;t Top of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and <HI>Racovi</HI> lying directly under it, my Opinion is rather, That <HI>Racovi</HI> is the &s;ame Town with the antient <HI>Cypari&s;&s;us.</HI> Again, I know not for what rea&s;on, either <HI>Cypari&s;&s;us</HI> or <HI>Racovi</HI> &s;hould be thought the &s;ame with <HI>Am|phry&s;&s;us.</HI> For <HI>Didymus,</HI> in his Note upon this Place of <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;aith, That <HI>Cypari&s;&s;us</HI> is a Town of <HI>Phocis,</HI> called &s;o either from <HI>Cypari&s;&s;us,</HI> Brother of <HI>Orchomenus,</HI> or from the multitude of tho&s;e Trees growing there|abouts; but he &s;aith nothing of its being the &s;ame with <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us. Pau|&s;anias</HI> &s;eems rather to apply that of <HI>Homer</HI> to <HI>Anticyrrha;</HI> which yet he makes different from <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us:</HI> for he mentions it expre&s;ly, as &s;itua|ted between <HI>Stiria</HI> and <HI>Anticyrrha:</HI> And though he may &s;eem to place it even under <HI>Parna&s;&s;us;</HI> yet it is not in this narrow Pa&s;&s;age of the Mountain, where <HI>Racovi</HI> &s;tandeth; but rather in the Plain, between the Mountains; which he therefore calleth, <HI>The</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>Territory, and Plain of Amphry&s;&s;us.</HI> Nor does the Di&s;tance agree between <HI>Racovi,</HI> and <HI>Stiri,</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="128">that now is; and <HI>Stiria,</HI> and <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us,</HI> of <HI>Pau&s;anias.</HI> For we were from before day, till pa&s;t Noon, going between tho&s;e two Places; and, I believe, travelled as much more Ground, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his <HI>Sixty Stadia</HI> come to, which make but &s;even Miles and a half; whereas I cannot judge it le&s;s than a dozen or fifteen Miles from <HI>Racovi</HI> to <HI>Stiri.</HI> Be|&s;ides <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> makes no mention of <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us,</HI> in his way between <HI>Chaeronea</HI> and <HI>Delphos,</HI> which he makes by <HI>Panopeus</HI> and <HI>Daulis;</HI> and thence into the way call'd <HI>Schi&s;tis:</HI> which way can no where &s;o pro|bably be conceived to be, as here, between the Mountain <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Cirphis,</HI> if we either con&s;ult the Place it &s;elf, or the Etymology of the Word; which imports Divi&s;ion, or &s;eparating things a&s;under. It is in this way, that <HI>Racovi</HI> &s;tandeth, about four. Miles from <HI>Ca&s;tri;</HI> and, I believe, more from <HI>Daulis,</HI> now called <HI>Dalia</HI> Ea&s;twards. He &s;aith moreover, That one going from <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us</HI> to <HI>Anticyrrha,</HI> mu&s;t a&s;cend <HI>Two Stadia.</HI> But from <HI>Racovi</HI> is no A&s;cent, but up the Mount <HI>Parna&s;|&s;us:</HI> Every way towards the Seaward, there is fir&s;t a con&s;iderable De&s;cent. But to proceed.</P>
<P>The next Morning we parted from <HI>Racovi</HI> by Day-break, and de&s;cen|ded yet further half an hour, upon the Brow of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> by near as ill a way as we had pa&s;&s;ed the day before in coming to it; only we kept &s;till forward, and did not return backward and forward. At la&s;t we came to the bottom, between the Mountains; from whence is yet a De|&s;cent two ways, both towards the <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>North-We&s;t.</HI> As we pa&s;&s;ed, I ob&s;erv'd abundance of Springs to i&s;&s;ue out of the Mountain, and collect them&s;elves in the bottom, between <HI>Cirphis</HI> and <HI>Parna&s;&s;us:</HI> &s;ome of them running towards the Gulph of <HI>Salona,</HI> or <HI>Cri&s;&s;a,</HI> by the Towns <HI>Ca&s;tri</HI> and <HI>Cri&s;&s;a,</HI> making the River <HI>Plei&s;tus;</HI> who&s;e Fountain ari&s;eth in this bottom, not a Bow-&s;hot from another Spring, which runs contrary to it; to wit, towards <HI>Livadia,</HI> and &s;o to the Lake <HI>Copais.</HI> Hence we yet de&s;cended &s;till South-Ea&s;t, by the way <HI>Schi&s;tis,</HI> between the two Mountains; but much better than before, along this la&s;t Stream; which grew bigger, and &s;ometimes lo&s;t it &s;elf among the Stones and Gravel. I believe it was antiently called <HI>Triton;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TRITON.</NOTE> which, with the River <HI>Melas,</HI> did take their Ri&s;e in the <HI>Phocaean</HI> Mountains. Two hours riding from <HI>Racovi,</HI> we came into a Plain between tho&s;e Mountains, which <HI>Pau&s;a|nias</HI> takes notice of for their being &s;o well planted with Vines, and a certain Shrub, like to <HI>Rhamnus;</HI> which the <HI>Ionians,</HI> he &s;aith, call <GAP DESC="foreign">: which, without doubt, is no other than the <HI>Ilex Cocci-glandifera;</HI> of the Grains of which, <HI>Scarlet Colour</HI> is made, and Confection of <HI>Alkermes,</HI> and the &s;ame that <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> calleth <GAP DESC="foreign">. I did not take parti|cular notice of its growing here, having already ob&s;erv'd it upon Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and abundance of other Places all over <HI>Greece.</HI> But <HI>Pau&s;a|nias</HI> &s;aith, That it was here particularly cultivated, and &s;et among the Vines; and in the &s;ame Order with them, by the <HI>Amphry&s;ians.</HI> The Mountains that encompa&s;s this Plain, are <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> North and North-Ea&s;t, <HI>Cirphis</HI> We&s;t, <HI>Helicon</HI> Ea&s;t and South; with &s;ome other high crag|gy Rocks South, and South-We&s;t, making the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Bay of <HI>A&s;pro&s;iti:</HI> Where I believe <HI>Anticyrrha</HI> was formerly, and thence the Promontory <HI>Pharygion.</HI> But of this more hereafter.</P>
<PB N="321" REF="128">
<P>When we were come into this Plain, we left the way to <HI>Livadia,</HI> and turned to the right hand Southward; and near our way, al&s;o on the right hand, we found an old Town de&s;troyed, with two old Churches, and a Ca&s;tle, all lying in Ruins. In one of the Churches, within a Niche, by the Altar, is an In&s;cription; but &s;o worn out, we could not make any thing of it. I &s;uppo&s;e this was <HI>Amphry&s;&s;us:</HI> For it is between <HI>Stiria</HI> and <HI>A&s;pro&s;piti;</HI> which I gue&s;s to be <HI>Anticyrrha,</HI> agreeing with <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his De&s;cription. Returning to our way, we came to another Stream, which runneth towards the <HI>Triton;</HI> but is &s;wallowed up by a Pa&s;&s;age under ground in its way, as I ob&s;erved returning from S^t <HI>Luca</HI> the la&s;t time. About the middle of the Plain we cro&s;&s;ed a way, that goeth from <HI>A&s;|pro&s;piti</HI> to <HI>Livadia;</HI> and &s;o proceeding, we left a Village, as my Com|panion &s;aith, called <HI>Stiri,</HI> and came to a De&s;art Place, by a narrow way, with Precipices on each &s;ide; which by little and little, enlargeth it &s;elf into a good big Hill, like a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> having a deep Valley almo&s;t round about, bounded by the high Cliffs of the Mountain <HI>Zagara,</HI> as they now call the <HI>Helicon,</HI> encompa&s;&s;ing both this Hill, and the Valley about it, with Tops covered with Snow as high as the Clouds.</P>
<P>Upon the Brow of this Hill, on the South-Ea&s;t-&s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. LUCE. STIRIA.</NOTE> is &s;ituated the Convent of S^t <HI>Luke,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Stiriotes,</HI> from this Hill &s;o called al&s;o. They do not mean S^t <HI>Luke</HI> the Evangeli&s;t; but another, a Hermite of this De&s;art: which we found by the Office we &s;aw, and they u&s;e in their Church; where the Title of <HI>Stiriotes</HI> is given him. This is one of the fine&s;t Convents in all <HI>Greece,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts ordinarily of above a Hundred and fifty Per&s;ons; of which &s;ome they call <HI>Hieromonachi;</HI> who are in Orders, and only attend upon the Service of God, and &s;ome other Employment in their Cells, as knitting of Caps, and other nece&s;&s;ary Affairs. The Seniors of the&s;e have a young one to wait on them, whom they teach to write, and read, and to &s;ay his Office. If he have any Ingenuity, he proceeds to under&s;tand to &s;ay their Liturgies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The others are called <HI>Caloiros;</HI> and are employed about all &s;ervile and nece&s;|&s;ary Offices about the Convent; &s;ome of them tilling the Ground, o|thers keeping the Sheep; and are commonly &s;een up and down in the Fields, about that bu&s;ine&s;s: only Sundays and Holy-days they meet all together in the Church. Out of the Seniors, the <HI>Abbots,</HI> whom they call <HI>Hegoumenoes,</HI> are cho&s;en every &s;econd Year. The pre&s;ent <HI>Abbot</HI> is named <HI>Gregorio;</HI> who is a good ingenious Man, and under&s;tands the antient <HI>Greek</HI> indifferently well. The Valley round about them belongs to the Convent, and bears good Wine, Oyl, Corn, and Honey. They have &s;everal little Huts up and down, where the <HI>Caloiros</HI> lodge near their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and the&s;e they call <HI>Metochia,</HI> the &s;ame word, which the antient <HI>Greeks</HI> u&s;ed for a Colony. Out of this they have a con&s;iderable Revenue: but of late are &s;o impoveri&s;hed by &s;ome &s;carce Years, that they have been forced to &s;ell their Church-plate, to pay the <HI>Turk</HI> his dues; which is Two hundred Dollers a Year, or about fifty Pounds <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The re&s;t of their Livelihood is Charity; which cannot be much in Money, out of the Mi&s;ery that poor People are brought into. They have been likewi&s;e, &s;ome Years ago, much mole&s;ted by the <HI>Turks;</HI> who came in companies, plundred them, mi&s;u&s;ed them, and &s;ome of them they kil|led; &s;o that the Convent was well near de&s;troyed: and, at la&s;t, they
<PB N="322" REF="129">were forced to flee to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to complain of the un&s;upportable Violences, again&s;t their Priviledges, obtained even from the <HI>Turks</HI> them|&s;elves. Upon which they had a <HI>Turk</HI> granted them, to protect them from the like Outrages; whom they are obliged to maintain, and pay.</P>
<P>We had the Company of the <HI>Hegoumenos</HI> a good while; and among other things we asked him, Who was the Founder of their Convent? Who told us, That it was the Emperour <HI>Romanus,</HI> Son to <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Seventh, and Grand-Son to <HI>Leon,</HI> called the <HI>Philo&s;opher:</HI> and &s;hew|ed us an old Book, that &s;pake of the Building of it; and carried us down into a Vault of the Church, and &s;hewed us two Tombs; which, he &s;aid, were the Tombs of this Emperour, and his Empre&s;s. My Com|rade then called to mind an In&s;cription, that we copied from the Walls of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that &s;peaketh of a Church built by the Emperour <HI>Ro|manus;</HI> which we &s;hould never have judged to have been this, had not this good Abbot a&s;&s;ured us, That it was built by the &s;ame Emperour, <HI>Ro|manus.</HI> All of the In&s;cription that remains perfect, is this you here &s;ee; and, perhaps, there is not much wanting.</P>

<P>That is to &s;ay, The great Emperour, <HI>Romanus,</HI> hath built a very great Church for all the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and this Tower from the Foundation. Where the word <HI>Romaiois</HI> ought to be tran&s;lated <HI>Greeks:</HI> For &s;ince the Seat of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was removed from <HI>Italy</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Greece</HI> hath been called <HI>Romania,</HI> and now more corruptedly <HI>Romelia;</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> commonly call them&s;elves <GAP DESC="foreign">, and their Language <GAP DESC="foreign">. And truly, this is the fine&s;t Church I &s;aw in all <HI>Greece,</HI> next to <HI>Santa Sophia</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> notwith&s;tanding it is old, and hath &s;uffered very much by Earthquakes, and Time. It is built after the <HI>Greek</HI> man|ner, almo&s;t &s;quare; without, it hath a Portico at the We&s;t end: From which are three Doors, to enter into the Church. Then there is an indifferent large <HI>Cuppalo</HI> in the middle; and is proportioned within, in the &s;hape of a Cro&s;s. All the Walls are ca&s;ed with poli&s;hed Marble, and the Pavement laid with Marble of &s;everal colours, and <HI>Ja&s;per</HI> and <HI>Por|phyry,</HI> &amp;c. The Roof and <HI>Cuppalo</HI> is adorned with antient Mo&s;aick Work, in Figures of our Saviour, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and others; with a Gal|lery round about it, &s;u&s;tained by Marble Pillars. We ob&s;erved al&s;o &s;e|veral Planks of Tran&s;parent Marble; of which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gulitier,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, hath made &s;uch Wonders in his Account of <HI>Athens:</HI> All the My&s;tery is, That the Marble being cut in thin Planks, and withal, being of it &s;elf a little Tran&s;parent, the Light looketh a little yellow through it. Adjoyning to this, on the South-&s;ide, is another little Church, dedicated to the Holy Virgin; which hath a pretty <HI>Portico,</HI> &s;u&s;tained by two <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, with their beautiful Chapiters on them. Hard by it is another, which is above in an upper Room, dedicated to <HI>Saint Sopito.</HI> Hither they bring their Sick to lodge; and &s;ay, They are of|ten
<PB N="323" REF="129">cured miraculou&s;ly. There we found a Fragment of an In&s;cription; and about the Walls of the Church, and Convent, &s;everal others. Tho&s;e that were not out of the reach of our Eyes, we copied. One of which is the Dedication of a Fountain, and its <HI>Ducts of Water</HI> to the Empe|rours, among&s;t the Gods, and to the City, by one <HI>Xenocrates</HI> and <HI>Euma|ridas,</HI> at their own Charges: But the Name of the City is not men|tioned.</P>

<P>I believe, that here might be the antient <HI>Stiria;</HI> if it be not that Vil|lage we pa&s;t by, not far from the Convent: For here is room enough for a little City: and, I &s;uppo&s;e, my Comrade did not ob&s;erve the Foun|dations of a Wall on the Top of this Hill, as I did another time; as al|&s;o, the Ruins underneath, in the Valley, North of it, which they call <HI>Palaeo-Stiri,</HI> or <HI>Old Stiria.</HI></P>
<P>The Covent it &s;elf &s;eemeth to have been built out of more antient Ruins; and I ob&s;erv'd many Pillars of gray Marble lying up and down there, and other antient hewn Stones. Their Accommodation for them|&s;elves, and Strangers, is indifferent good, con&s;idering the Country; and they receive them with as great Civility, and Kindne&s;s, as the Grand Charter-hou&s;e, near <HI>Grenoble,</HI> in the <HI>Alps,</HI> doth: though they want their great Revenues, and Pro&s;perity. They &s;ent for a good Lamb from the Fold, and killed it for us; and be&s;ide, with Rice, Chickens, good O|lives, Chee&s;e, Bread, and Wine, they gave us a mo&s;t hearty and Chri&s;ti|an Welcome. Their Cells are little arched Rooms of Stone, and every one hath one to him&s;elf. Their manner of living is the &s;ame with all the <HI>Greek</HI> Monks, u&s;ing &s;evere Fa&s;ting in their Lents, and never eating Fle&s;h at any time. They ri&s;e three hours before day to their Morning-Service: Three hours after Sun-ri&s;ing, is their Communion-Service; and two hours before night, their Evening-Service, or Ve&s;pers. They have other Books al&s;o, they read between, at &s;et Hours, in private. They told us al&s;o, That they had many <HI>Manu&s;cripts;</HI> but we &s;aw only ordi|nary ones, as of Service-Books, Evangeli&s;ts, Saints Lives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The be&s;t of which was that of S^t <HI>Co&s;mas,</HI> and S^t <HI>Damianus;</HI> with which were joyned the Lives of S^t <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome,</HI> S^t <HI>Matthew,</HI> and S^t <HI>Philip,</HI> the A|po&s;tles, upon Vellom well written. When I return'd thither afterwards, I &s;aw the Works of S^t <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome;</HI> which then was in a Fathers Cham|ber; who read it, and under&s;tands the antient <HI>Greek</HI> pretty well. It is fair written, and by the hand &s;hould be about five or &s;ix hundred Years old. They pretend to have others of their own, which I could not be permitted to &s;ee; and &s;ome that belong'd to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Athens.</HI> An Evangeli&s;tary I bought, written in Capital Letters; but as
<PB N="324" REF="130">to the Age, I hope to give a better Account another time. They eat all together in a Hall; round which are long Tables of white Marble, where they &s;it according to Seniority; and at the upper end is a little one, where the <HI>Hegoumenos</HI> &s;its alone in a Chair. They have &s;everal Offices, and Ceremonies, before and after Dinner. At that after Din|ner I was pre&s;ent, when I returned this way, and is thus: When all have dined, and are ri&s;en, before they depart the Room, there is a piece of Bread brought in a di&s;h, and a cup of Wine &s;et upon the <HI>Hegoumeno</HI>'s Table; which by Prayers he &s;eems to Con&s;ecrate, like the Sacrament; and then brings it round the Hall: fir&s;t the Bread; of which every one breaketh a Crumb, as they &s;tand ranked from one end of the Hall to the other, on each &s;ide. Then the Wine is brought in like manner, and every one drinketh of it round. After which &s;ome Prayers and Thank&s;|givings are &s;aid; and then every one departeth to his Cell. The next day, after Morning-Service, the <HI>Hegoumenos</HI> carried us into a kind of Buttery, as I may call it, and made us breakfa&s;t with him, with Bread and Honey, and Olives, good Wine and <HI>Aqua Vitae.</HI> He told us then, among&s;t other things, That the Amba&s;&s;adour of <HI>France,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Nantuille,</HI> was there &s;everal days, and would fain have had the <HI>Roman Ma&s;s</HI> &s;aid in their Church. But they told him, It was a thing they could by no means grant, it being contrary to their Rites. But he yet pre&s;|&s;ing them, they at la&s;t ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it; letting him know, that if &s;uch a thing &s;hould be done, they could no more &s;ay their Liturgy in that Church. At which the Amba&s;&s;adour was very much offended, be|ing a great Zelot for the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, who made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s every where to per&s;wade the <HI>Greeks,</HI> that their Belief is the &s;ame with the <HI>La|tines,</HI> &s;ome few Punctilioes only excepted. But they then had had no News of the Council held by the Patriarch, and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops, by his con|trivance; and the Doctrine of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI> was altogether unknown to them, as I before &s;aid.</P>
<P>There was then a young Father, that &s;pake very good <HI>Italian,</HI> being a Native of <HI>Zant:</HI> He was our Interpreter; and when we parted with the <HI>Hegoumenos,</HI> he carried us to &s;ee their Provi&s;ions of <HI>Wine,</HI> and <HI>O|lives,</HI> which they pre&s;erve in the longe&s;t Casks I ever &s;aw; &s;everal of them I mea&s;ured, near twenty foot long. <HI>Olives</HI> pickled are their great Su&s;tenance in Lent; which are not pickled green, as in the&s;e Parts; but when they are full ripe, and full of Oyl. They eat them with Vinegar, being very nouri&s;hing, and whol&s;ome Food, and very grateful to the Stomach.</P>
<P>There is an Hermite, that liveth a Mile and half off, whom I &s;aw not this time; but when I la&s;t came that way, the <HI>April</HI> en&s;uing, we went to his Hermitage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THE HERMITAGE</NOTE> de&s;cending from the Convent, down the Hill South|wards; fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing a little River in a plea&s;ant Plain, well planted with Vineyards and Olive-trees; and among them, little Hou&s;es, where the <HI>Caloyers</HI> come &s;ometimes for Recreation, in the Summer. After this we mounted up by a &s;teep Rock, by an ea&s;ie A&s;cent, in a way cut out of the Rock, and large enough for two Carts to pa&s;s by one another; on the top of which we di&s;cerned the antient Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, and a Town. This I believe to be that, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> calleth <HI>Bulis,</HI> in the Confines of <HI>Pho|cis</HI> and <HI>Boeotia,</HI> &s;even <HI>Stadia,</HI> or almo&s;t a Mile from the Port; for there
<PB N="325" REF="130">is a Harbour about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Place; and was, without doubt, that which <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth <HI>Mycus Portus,</HI> the la&s;t Port of the <HI>Pho|caeans;</HI> beyond which the Rocks of Mount <HI>Helicon</HI> did hang over, as indeed they do there. Near this Harbour the Convent hath a <HI>Metochy,</HI> or Farm; and in the Harbour they fi&s;h, and lade the Corn they can &s;pare, to tran&s;port it to the Neighbouring Parts. Thence we turned to the left hand, upon a Ridge of craggy Rocks, about half a Mile, which brought us to the Cell of the Hermite.</P>
<P>The Hermitage is &s;ituated upon the South-Ea&s;t-&s;ide of a Rock; and is a little Hou&s;e, with a pretty Chapel, or Oratory, at the upper end of a large Garden, mo&s;t plea&s;ant by Nature, without much A&s;&s;i&s;tance either of Co&s;t, or Art. It is only hedged about with &s;uch Shrubs, and Bu&s;hes, as the Soil beareth, the upper &s;ide which is fenced by the Rock, only excepted. But Nature is here profu&s;e in curious Plants; of which I ga|thered about half a hundred, that grow not ordinarily in <HI>England,</HI> in and about the Garden: Of which I &s;hall defer to &s;peak, till I come to <HI>Athens;</HI> becau&s;e I &s;aw mo&s;t of them there again, with many others. Something below his Hou&s;e, de&s;cending towards the lower &s;ide of his Garden, is a Fountain of very good Water; and beyond that a River, that runneth down from the high Cliffs of the <HI>Helicon,</HI> making a natu|ral <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> at &s;uch a convenient di&s;tance, that it affordeth great Plea|&s;ure to the Eyes, without the lea&s;t Offence to the Ears: until, at la&s;t, with all the murmurs of Applau&s;e, a Poet in his mo&s;t charming Con|templations can fan&s;ie, it pa&s;&s;eth by this happy Place, where Peace and Innocency &s;eem to dwell; far out of the reach of the Hate or Flattery of incon&s;tant Fortune; to which, even tho&s;e Rocks, and the va&s;t Stones that lie in its Channel, &s;eem to comply, and, while Men &s;eem dumb, make their Prai&s;es mount aloud to Heaven. A prodigious height round about, one di&s;covereth the <HI>Helicon's</HI> white Tops, &s;till covered with Snow; which this poor Hermites aged Head &s;eemeth, in epitome, to re&s;emble. He followeth the Steps of S^t <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s; not cloath|ed in Hypocritical Rags; but with a decent long Garment, of a brown Hair-colour, dyed of that hue with the Skins of Wallnuts; and not much differing from the re&s;t of the <HI>Caloyers.</HI> But his Life is mo&s;t &s;e|vere. His ordinary food is Bread and Herbs, and his drink Water; and that only on <HI>Sunday, Tue&s;day, Thur&s;day,</HI> and <HI>Saturday.</HI> Sometime upon <HI>Sa|turday, Sunday,</HI> and great Holy-days, he will eat a little Honey and Bread; but hardly ever drinketh Wine, but that of the Holy Sacrament. The time that he &s;pendeth from his Devotions, he employeth in writing Books of their Liturgies. He hath a Companion, or Servant, that doth him all nece&s;&s;ary Offices; but u&s;eth not &s;uch &s;everity as him&s;elf. His employment, at &s;pare time, is chiefly in making Cro&s;&s;es; which he car|veth with admirable Curio&s;ity. The Work is hollow, and &s;o fine, that it is beyond Belief; and hath repre&s;ented upon it the principal Parts of our Faith, as the Nativity, Annunciation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but e&s;pecially the Death and Pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour. For one of the&s;e I offered <HI>Ten Dollers;</HI> but he would not part with it, hearing we made no u&s;e of them in our Devotions in <HI>England.</HI> Upon the Door of his little Chapel, I found a Fragment of an In&s;cription; of which I could learn no great News: only the&s;e words,
&Egr;&Pgr;&Igr; &Xgr;&Egr;&Ngr;&Ogr; &Bgr;&Ogr;&Ugr;&Lgr;&EEgr; &Egr;&Pgr;&Igr; &Xgr;&Egr;&Ngr;&OHgr;&Ngr;.
Perhaps,
<PB N="326" REF="131">there was a Town hereabouts, called <HI>Epixenus;</HI> but I find it not a|mong either the Antient, or Modern Geographers. Perhaps it was a Village, or kind of Colony, built by the forementioned <HI>Xenocrates.</HI> For in that In&s;cription I find
&Kgr;&Agr;&Igr; &Tgr;&Ogr; &Egr;&Pgr;&Ogr;&Igr;&Kgr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Ngr;.
<HI>Suidas</HI> interprets <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Place where Shepherds, or Farmers, live in the Country, a Village, or Country-hou&s;e; and <GAP DESC="foreign"> he interprets by <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Colonus,</HI> one that was put in the&s;e Colonies, or Villages, to live and cul|tivate them. And if &s;o, it was of no antienter Date than the <HI>Romans,</HI> by that In&s;cription.</P>
<P>After I had di&s;cour&s;ed &s;ometime with this good Old Man, whom they e&s;teem a Saint, I was conducted below his Garden, between it and the River, to another Hutt; where two other <HI>Caloyers</HI> live, and look to a Gar|den, well planted with Beans and Pea&s;e; and another ju&s;t by it, furni&s;h|ed with four or five hundred Stocks of Bees. A Place near as plea&s;ant as the other above; being ju&s;t upon the Banks of the River; which I e&s;teem to be that, which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> calleth <HI>Heraclitus;</HI> upon &s;uppo&s;iti|on, that &s;ome of the forementioned Ruins are tho&s;e of <HI>Bulis.</HI> The good <HI>Caloyer</HI> pre&s;ently went, and took a Stock of Bees, and brought me a Plate of delicate white Honey-combs, with Bread and Olives, and very good Wine: To which he &s;et us down in his Hutt, and made us a Dinner, with far greater &s;atisfaction, than the mo&s;t Princely Banquet in <HI>Europe</HI> could afford us. For the Quiet and Innocency of their Life, the natu|ral Beauty of the Place, the Rocks, Mountains, Streams, Woods, and cu|rious Plants, joyn'd with the Harmonious Notes of Nightingales, and other Birds, in whole Quires, celebrating, and as it were, welcoming that forward Spring, to &s;peak the truth, &s;o charmed my melancholick Fancy for a time, that I had almo&s;t made a Re&s;olution never to part with &s;o great a Happine&s;s, for whatever the re&s;t of the World could pre&s;ent me with. But, in conclu&s;ion, it prov'd too hard a Task for me, &s;o &s;oon to wean my &s;elf from the World.</P>
<P>We left this Convent &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have done, by rea&s;on of our Janizaries, who began to be too bold with the poor Monks; demanding of them whole Sheep, Rice, Wine, and whatever came in their fancy, without either Mode&s;ty or Di&s;cretion: And they, poor People, entertain all that come with &s;uch things as they have, freely. But few, that are civil, will go away, without making them a Requital, by &s;ome charitable Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We took our Leaves of them about Noon, and went part of the &s;ame way back, that we came, for about an hour, over the Plain of <HI>Amphry&s;|&s;us:</HI> Then, turning Northwards, we pa&s;&s;ed by a Village under the <HI>He|licon,</HI> on the right hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SYRBE.</NOTE> called <HI>Syrbe:</HI> So &s;till keeping the <HI>Helicon</HI> on our right hand, we kept turning under it, till we came again into the way, which brought us North-Ea&s;t to <HI>Livadia,</HI> an hour before night.</P>
<P><HI>Livadia</HI> is an antient City, and continues &s;till its old Name: For the <HI>Greeks</HI> pronounce B,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIVADIA. LIBADIA.</NOTE> <HI>Beta,</HI> as we do the V con&s;onant; and is not only the Modern, but very probably, the antient Pronunciation. For the <HI>Latines,</HI> when they u&s;ed the V con&s;onant, to write it in <HI>Greek,</HI> they would make u&s;e of the letter <HI>Beta,</HI> and &s;ometimes the <HI>ov:</HI> as for <HI>Vale|rianus,</HI> upon Medals I have both

being written &s;o many ways. The Situation is about a pointed Hill; on the top of which is an old Ca&s;tle, on the North-&s;ide of the high Cliffs of a moderately high Mountain; which I took to be part of the <HI>Helicon,</HI> &s;eeing the white Tops of that over it, until I found it &s;eparated from it by a Valley at my Return. But now I &s;uppo&s;e it to be <HI>Mons Tilphu&s;ium,</HI> counted <HI>Fifty Stadia</HI> from <HI>Haliartus,</HI> between that and <HI>Alalcomenae,</HI> and between <HI>Alalacomenae</HI> and <HI>Coronaea.</HI> The River <HI>Her|eyna</HI> ri&s;eth here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERCYNA</NOTE> and cometh with &s;uch a plentiful Source out of the Moun|tain by the Ca&s;tle, that it turneth twenty Mills in the Town, not a Bow|&s;hot off its ri&s;e; and is a large River, &s;o &s;oon as it comes together from the &s;everal Mills: which makes me I do not call it the <HI>Fountain;</HI> but think, that &s;ome other Rivers from the <HI>Helicon</HI> do make it ri&s;e here by a Subterraneous Pa&s;&s;age under the Mountain. From <HI>Livadia</HI> it goeth, and meeteth the River I but now mentioned, ri&s;ing below <HI>Racovi,</HI> be|tween <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Cirphis;</HI> which cometh this way, and joyneth with this River about an hours riding, North of <HI>Livadia,</HI> in the way to <HI>Tur|chocorio.</HI> We alighted at a <HI>Kan,</HI> near the Entrance we came in at; but finding one of <HI>Zant,</HI> that invited us to his Hou&s;e, we went to lodge with him. He is called <HI>Signior Alexander,</HI> and hath here advanced him|&s;elf to be a Phy&s;ician of <HI>Greece,</HI> from a Cobler of <HI>Zant.</HI> His whole Library is a Book of <HI>Receipts.</HI> My Comrade &s;et him up with &s;ome Di|rections he gave him, to make Cly&s;ters and Julips.

</FIGURE>The <HI>Turks</HI> would needs know of us what was written thereon, and whe|ther they were very antient. We told them, That one &s;pake of one <HI>Charopinos,</HI> that was Governour of <HI>Lebadia,</HI> and <HI>Boeotia,</HI> with other Of|ficers, and was an In&s;cription of at lea&s;t Fifteen hundred Years old. They told us, Then it was of the Times of the <HI>Hellenes;</HI> by which they meant, in the time of <HI>Pagani&s;me:</HI> For now they u&s;e that word mo&s;t commonly in that &s;en&s;e; though of old times, it &s;ignified only the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> al&s;o, to &s;ignifie the antient <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, &s;ay, <GAP DESC="foreign">: But <GAP DESC="foreign"> for their pre&s;ent Language. Returning out of the <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> we &s;aw five or &s;ix <HI>Turks</HI> of Quality, &s;itting with their great Strings of Beads, according to their Mode. One of them enquired what we were; and hearing we were <HI>Francks,</HI> and that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> was a Phy&s;ician, he held out his hand for him to feel his Pul&s;e; who, like the Gyp&s;ies, foretold only Health, and good Fortune, and &s;o came off. This Town &s;eemeth inhabited by a more civil, and gentile &s;ort of <HI>Turks</HI> than ordinary; and wear very good Cloaths, according to their Mode. They are more in number than the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> have five <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and are governed by a <HI>Veivode,</HI> and a <HI>Caddi.</HI> The <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> likewi&s;e have four or five Churches, but almo&s;t ruined. The be&s;t are <HI>Panagia,</HI> S^t <HI>Anne,</HI> and St. <HI>George.</HI> The Church of S^t <HI>Demetrius</HI> was burned &s;ome Years
<PB N="329" REF="132">ago. There are but few <HI>Jews</HI> here; but the Town is large and popu|lous: among which are many rich Inhabitants of the <HI>Turks.</HI> Their Trade con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome Woollen Stuffs they make there; and Rice, which they &s;ell ready husked, and prepar'd by tho&s;e Mills on the River, and there|with furni&s;h all the adjacent Parts.</P>
<P>This Town was celebrated in old times for the Oracle of <HI>Trophonius;</HI> which was in a Cavern, in a Hill. I rather believe it was in that above the Town, than that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> mentions, and we &s;aw in a Rock, a Mile di&s;tant North of it, when we parted thence to <HI>Thebes.</HI> But <HI>Pau|&s;anias</HI> indeed is not &s;o clear as might be wi&s;hed, by rea&s;on of his long Digre&s;&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s one may collect it, being he &s;aith, That the <HI>Trophonian</HI> Grove was by the Fountain of this River <HI>Hercyna:</HI> And I ob&s;erv'd, where the Water i&s;&s;ueth out in greate&s;t abundance, it was made up with Boards, ju&s;t in the Corner under the Ca&s;tle, without doubt to cover &s;ome dangerous Cavern. And <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, This Oracle was in the Mountain above the Grove; &s;o that it mu&s;t be that above the Town, if that were the Fountain <HI>Hercyna,</HI> of which there is no doubt. By <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his De&s;cription, one would believe, that the Hole on the Top of the Hill reached to this at the Bottom. For tho&s;e that entred it to con&s;ult the Oracle, were to put their Head and Knees in &s;uch a certain place and po&s;ture, and were &s;uddenly carried down as by a <HI>Vor|tex,</HI> or Whirlepool of a mo&s;t &s;wift River. This might ea&s;ily be &s;o done, by &s;topping the Water at the Bottom, until it ro&s;e very high; and then letting it go of a &s;udden: But he that went to &s;teal the Trea&s;ure there, had not &s;o good a Preparation: for it prov'd a Trap to him, by which he broke him&s;elf to pieces, and was taken up another way, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> informs you. All the&s;e things want good Search, and Examination; and are not ea&s;ily to be found out by Travellers, that &s;tay but a little while in a Place; unle&s;s we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e them to have &s;o many of the anti|ent <HI>Greek</HI> Authors almo&s;t by heart.

if I have copied it right; of which I am not &s;o well a&s;&s;ured, as to be po&s;itive. The Game <HI>Pam|boiotia</HI> is here mentioned, which <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;ay, was cele|brated in the Plain of <HI>Coronaea,</HI> by or in the Temple of <HI>Minerva Itonia;</HI> where all the <HI>Boeotians</HI> a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the Twenty fifth we parted from <HI>Livadia</HI> about eleven in the Morning; and about half a Mile out of Town, being come to the top of a little Hill, being a &s;mall Ridge of <HI>Laphy&s;tius,</HI> we had the Pro|&s;pect of a &s;pacious and fertil Plain, encompa&s;&s;ed with Mountains, but not very high, if compared with tho&s;e of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Helicon.</HI> It is &s;tretch|ed in length from <HI>Livadia,</HI> South-Ea&s;t, near twenty Miles; and in breadth is as much, comprehending the Lake and Mar&s;hes; which take up near half of the North-Ea&s;t &s;ide of it. This Lake was formerly called <HI>The Lake of Copais;</HI> but now <HI>Livadias Limne,</HI> or <HI>The Lake of Livadia:</HI> and not <HI>Stivo-lago;</HI> meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>Thiva Limne,</HI> as our Modern Maps make it. For that is another Lake, that was formerly called <HI>Hylica pa|lus:</HI> Of all which I &s;hall have more to &s;ay in the La&s;t Book.</P>
<P>We left the Lake <HI>Copais</HI> at a good di&s;tance, on the left hand, and kept &s;till &s;treight forwards under the Mountains, on the right hand, South-Ea&s;twards; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, were the Mountains <HI>Tilphu&s;ium</HI> and <HI>La|phy&s;tius.</HI> I ob&s;erv'd &s;ix good large Streams, cro&s;&s;ing our way, and run|ning Northwards towards the Lake; which may be <HI>Ocaled, Tilphu&s;a, Lophis, Olmens, Coralius,</HI> and <HI>Perme&s;&s;us,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> and <HI>Strabo.</HI> There are many little Villages up and down in this Plain; &s;ome Vineyards, a great deal of Corn-ground and Pa&s;turage; well &s;tock'd al|&s;o with Sheep, and other Cattle. But it is very much &s;ubject to Inunda|tions, upon great Rains, or melting of the Snow from the Mountains: which is no wonder, having no Pa&s;&s;age above ground for the Water out of the Lake, but only that into <HI>Hylica palus:</HI> which al&s;o lieth &s;o high, that the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">art of the Plain mu&s;t needs be drowned, before the overflowing Water would find a Pa&s;&s;age that way; the ordinary Pa&s;&s;ages out of the Lake being under ground.</P>
<P>About fourteen Miles from <HI>Livadia</HI> we pa&s;t by a Village on our left hand, called <HI>Charamenitis;</HI> and about an hour before night another, which they call <HI>Diminia;</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Two Months,</HI> becau&s;e the Corn there is &s;owed, ripe, and reaped within the &s;pace of two Months: the Floods of the Lake not permitting them to &s;ow before <HI>April,</HI> and it being Har|ve&s;t-time with them by the beginning of <HI>June.</HI> By this Town is a Rock; on the Top of which appear the antient Walls of a Town. My Compani|on
<PB N="331" REF="133">thinketh, it may be <HI>Onche&s;tus;</HI> but I think it rather <HI>Coronaea,</HI> for Rea|&s;ons I have el&s;ewhere given. Here is a Fountain, that ri&s;eth at the Foot of the Rock; which makes the Stream <HI>Coralius.</HI></P>
<P>In half an hour thence we came to <HI>Megalo-molci;</HI> where we lodged in an indifferent good <HI>Kan. Molci</HI> &s;ignifies properly Farms belonging to the <HI>Grand Signior;</HI> where tho&s;e that inhabit are no other than his Servants, and Workmen. This is a large &s;quare Court, compo&s;ed of little Hou&s;es, for tho&s;e that either labour, till the Ground, or attend the Cattle; where at night they retire to lodge. The&s;e &s;eem badly to imi|tate the <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies, with this great difference, That tho&s;e had &s;till &s;ome great Priviledges granted them; but the&s;e are all Slaves. The next day we parted thence by Sun-ri&s;ing, and within half an hour came to the South-Ea&s;t end of the Plain, bounded by a little Ridge of a Moun|tain, that runneth out from Mount <HI>Phoenix</HI> on the left hand, and ano|ther on the right I believe was <HI>Libethrius.</HI> As &s;oon as we got on the Top of this Hill we began to &s;ee <HI>Thebes,</HI> at the further end of another Plain, Ea&s;t North-Ea&s;t of us; and behind us we had the Hill by <HI>Livadia,</HI> We&s;t North-We&s;t. This Plain is now called <HI>Thivas Cambos;</HI> and in old time; to the &s;ame effect, the <HI>Theban Plain.</HI> It is bounded with Hills and Moun|tains, and is much le&s;s than that of <HI>Livadia.</HI> The Northern Bounds of this I take to be the Mountain <HI>Phoenicius,</HI> from <HI>Strabo;</HI> which <HI>Pau&s;ani|as</HI> &s;eems to call <HI>Sphinx,</HI> or <HI>Sphingius mons.</HI> That on the right hand, or the Southern Bounds of this Plain, I know not how it was antiently cal|led; but is a Ridge of the Mountain <HI>Libethrius,</HI> which is the &s;ame of the Mountain <HI>Helicon:</HI> and is the &s;ame that &s;eparates the Plain of <HI>The|&s;pia,</HI> from the Plain of <HI>Thebes.</HI> I ob&s;erved a Torrent run down from this Mountain in wet Weather, which &s;tagnates in the Plain; and makes it very dangerous to be pa&s;&s;ed, for a time, on that Road. About the middle of this Plain I ob&s;erved a Stream, I &s;uppo&s;e was called <HI>Peroe;</HI> and hard by the Town another, which I believe to be that of <HI>Dirce:</HI> Both which, running Northward, to the Lake of <HI>Thebes,</HI> called now <HI>Thivas Limne,</HI> but antiently <HI>Hylica palus,</HI> we cro&s;&s;ed and arrived at <HI>Thebes</HI> by Noon.</P>
<P><HI>Thebes</HI> is yet called <GAP DESC="foreign">, which they pronounce <HI>Thiva,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THEBES.</NOTE> and not <HI>Sti|va,</HI> as our Maps have it; which is from the &s;ame Errour I have often mentioned, hearing the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;ay <HI>Stin, Thiva,</HI> and not knowing how to pronounce their <HI>Theta,</HI> or <HI>Th. Thebes</HI> is &s;ituated in Thirty eight De|grees, Twenty two Minutes Latitude, as M^r <HI>Vernon</HI> ob&s;erved; and be|tween two little Streams, one on the We&s;t &s;ide, and the other on the Ea&s;t &s;ide. This I gue&s;s to be <HI>I&s;menus,</HI> and the other <HI>Dirce,</HI> as I &s;aid. I know not why my Comrade &s;eemeth of the contrary Opinion. For <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> after he had de&s;cribed the North, and Ea&s;t Regions, from the Gate <HI>Praetida</HI> to <HI>Chalcis</HI> ward, begins again at the Gate <HI>Neitis;</HI> and after &s;ome Monuments taken notice of there, pa&s;&s;eth this River <HI>Dirce,</HI> and &s;o goes on to the Temple of the <HI>Cabira</HI> and <HI>The&s;pia:</HI> all which is We&s;t|ward of the City. He &s;aith al&s;o, <HI>I&s;menius</HI> is out of the Town, on the right hand of the Gate <HI>Homoloides,</HI> and pa&s;&s;eth by a Hill, called by the &s;ame Name, <HI>I&s;menius;</HI> which cannot agree with any thing We&s;tward, but with that Ea&s;tward. This Town &s;eemeth now in the &s;ame conditi|on it was in <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his time; that is to &s;ay, only inhabited in that
<PB N="332" REF="134">Part, which was the Ca&s;tle; and in more antient times called <HI>Cadmea,</HI> from <HI>Cadmus</HI> its Founder, Son of <HI>Agenor:</HI> who after he had a long time, in vain, &s;ought his Si&s;ter <HI>Europa,</HI> &s;tollen away by <HI>Jupiter;</HI> and not da|ring to return to his Father, by command of the Oracle he &s;taid, and built here a &s;trong Ca&s;tle upon a &s;mall Hill: which <HI>Amphion</HI> afterwards walled in, as the Poets fan&s;ie, by the &s;ound of his Harp, making the Stones to come, and lay them&s;elves in due Order for the Building. The Walls that now are, &s;eem very antient, having &s;ome &s;quare Towers, the Stones well hewn, and laid in very exact Order, according to Rules of Art. The Figure of the Ca&s;tle is oval; and all within the Walls clo&s;e built, better fa&s;hion'd, and higher than is u&s;ual in that Country. It is e|&s;teemed three Miles about, and to contain three or four thou&s;and Souls. The <HI>Turks,</HI> who &s;eem the lea&s;t Part of the Town, have two <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;everal Churches. The Cathedral is called <HI>Panagia Chry&s;ophoritza;</HI> which hath nothing of &s;pecial Remark about it, only &s;ome Fragments of antient In&s;criptions among the Stones of the Pave|ment; and &s;uch as the&s;e, in &s;ome other Places about the Town, are all the Remains of Antiquity we &s;aw. We found not the Temples, <HI>Gym|na&s;ium,</HI> and other &s;uch Buildings, mentioned by the Antients to have been there. This was, in antient times, the chief City of <HI>Boeotia;</HI> yet never were they very famous in Hi&s;tory, either for Wit, Learning, or Valour: only they behav'd them&s;elves bravely again&s;t the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Epaminondas</HI> their General, a <HI>Theban</HI> born, and one of the mo&s;t Valiant and Renowned Captains of <HI>Greece:</HI> which made <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> &s;ay, <HI>That the Glory of the Thebans was born, and buried with</HI> Epaminon|das.</P>
<P>There are two <HI>Kans</HI> in the Town; but we lodged at a <HI>Greek</HI>'s Hou&s;e, called <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> Son of <HI>Panagioti Luca</HI> of <HI>Livadia;</HI> who entertain'd us civilly. He carried us a little out of the Town, towards the way to <HI>Ne|gropont;</HI> and &s;hewed us a Hill, where they dig a kind of Stone they make Bowls for Tabaco-pipes of. The Stone, when 'tis fir&s;t dig'd out of a deep Pit, is of the colour of new Chee&s;e, and almo&s;t as &s;oft, being in lumps ordinarily as big as a Man's two Fi&s;ts. This they bring to the Town, and carve very curiou&s;ly into Bowls of Pipes; which, as &s;oon as it is dry, groweth very hard, as white as Snow, and &s;hining. The be&s;t are &s;old for <HI>Ten A&s;pers</HI> apiece, and the wor&s;er &s;ort for <HI>Five A&s;pers.</HI> The be&s;t, and lea&s;t apt to break, are tho&s;e which are heavie&s;t: Some of them I bought, and do re&s;erve among my natural Curio&s;ities. This Hill I gue&s;s to be that called <HI>I&s;menius Collis;</HI> and hath the little River running by the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it.</P>
<P>Not far from this, cro&s;&s;ing over the Stream, is a Village called <HI>Taba|cides,</HI> from that Hill; where there is a Church dedicated to S^t <HI>Luke,</HI> with a Tomb in it; which, they &s;ay, is S^t <HI>Luke's:</HI> but the In&s;cription up|on it, &s;heweth it to have been &s;ome antient Pagan's Tomb, who&s;e Name was <HI>Nedymos.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thur&s;day January</HI> the Twenty &s;ixth, we parted from <HI>Thiva,</HI> or <HI>Thebes,</HI> as &s;oon as it was day; and going out at the Ea&s;t-gate, we turned South-Ea&s;twards, and pa&s;&s;ed a long the Stream <HI>I&s;menus,</HI> which turneth &s;everal Mills in its cour&s;e. After a Mile, or a Mile and half riding up Hill, by an ea&s;ie A&s;cent, we came to the Fountain-head; which is a very fine, large, and clear Spring, and was dedicated to <HI>Mars,</HI> who, as the Poets tell, protected it by a Dragon. We &s;till kept on, mounting by an ea&s;ie A&s;cent, a Mile or two further; and then again as ea&s;ily de&s;cending a little way, by a Bridge we pa&s;t over a Stream, which runneth Ea&s;twards; and is, without doubt, the River <HI>A&s;opus.</HI> After this we began again to a&s;cend; and at la&s;t went up a Rocky Hill, by a very bad way, until about Noon we got pa&s;t the Top of it, to a Village called <HI>&V;lachi;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ULACHI.</NOTE> which is the Name the <HI>Albane&s;es</HI> call them&s;elves by, in their own Language; and is inhabited by them, in about thirty or forty Hou&s;es. I ob&s;erved &s;ome antient Walls, and Caves under ground; and before we came to it, a little Tower, upon the Top of a Hill, from whence one &s;eeth <HI>Thebes,</HI> as I was after told by <HI>Con&s;ul Giraud.</HI> This is a kind of Ridge of the Mountain <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> that runneth out from it Ea&s;tward towards <HI>Oropus,</HI> and was &s;ometimes the Bounds of <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Boeotia:</HI> And this Village was, in old times, perhaps, that <HI>Harma</HI> of <HI>Attica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">HARMA ATTICAE.</NOTE> mention'd by the An|tients.
<PB N="334" REF="135">This Village had been pillaged by Pyrates, not above two or three days before; and they were almo&s;t frighted out of their Sen&s;es, at the &s;ight of us. It is &s;trange tho&s;e Robbers &s;hould be &s;o bold, as to come &s;o far from Sea, and up &s;o bad ways, as they mu&s;t needs do to come hi|ther. For from the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, it is at lea&s;t fifteen Miles; and as much, or more, from that of <HI>Negropont.</HI> And that they &s;hould not be able to defend them&s;elves from &s;o incon&s;iderable a number of Men, as tho&s;e Pyrates mu&s;t needs be, is as &s;trange. But the rea&s;on is, That in the day-time few of the Men, pertaining to that Place, are at home, being di&s;per&s;ed up and down the Mountains with their Flocks and Herds; and are not permitted by the <HI>Turks,</HI> to have Arms in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>After Dinner we pa&s;&s;ed over a Plain, for two hours and a half; and by the way, I ob&s;erved many Ponds up and down in it, with plenty of Wild Ducks, and Teal in them; one or two of which we &s;hot. Here are al&s;o many of tho&s;e Oaks I before de&s;cribed at <HI>Troy,</HI> with great A|corns they gather <HI>Vellania</HI> from.

My Companion calleth it now <HI>Ozea,</HI> or <HI>Noezaea:</HI> and 'tis very true, that part of it, <HI>viz.</HI> going from <HI>Attica</HI> to <HI>Negropont,</HI> is called &s;o: but this is called <HI>Cha&s;ha,</HI> from a Village on the &s;ide of it, in the way down to the Plains of <HI>Attica,</HI> &s;o named. Here we lay in a mi|&s;erable ruin'd <HI>Kan,</HI> without any Door, or any other Accommodation belonging to it, but what we brought with us; only there is a very cu|rious Fountain hard by it, where the Wolves, and Bears, and Wild Boars come to drink; to which this Mountain is yet a great Covert. For it is indeed almo&s;t covered with Pine-trees; of which we made a good Fire to keep us from the cold; and &s;topped up the Entrance into the <HI>Kan,</HI> to &s;ecure us from the A&s;&s;aults of Wild Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t by this Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIGLA-CA|STRO.</NOTE> upon a Rock in the Pa&s;&s;age, are the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle, which they now call <HI>Bigla-Ca&s;tro,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Watch-Tower. The Walls that remain &s;eem very antient, and are well cemen|ted together, of good, well hewn, and hard Stone. The Di&s;tance from <HI>Athens</HI> that Authors give of <HI>Phyla,</HI> and the De&s;cription of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> make me believe, that this was antiently called <HI>Phyla,</HI> fa|mous for the Exploit of <HI>Thra&s;ibulus;</HI> who here began his Stratagem, for regaining the Liberty of his Country, <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Attica,</HI> from the thirty Tyrants impo&s;ed on them by the <HI>Lacedemonians.</HI> From this Mountain we looked down, with un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure and Content, upon the cele|brated <HI>Athens,</HI> we had &s;o long wi&s;hed to be at; with the noble Plains of <HI>Attica,</HI> &s;o famous in antient Story. The next Morning we de&s;cended the Mountain by a narrow and dangerous way, pa&s;&s;ing by a Village called <HI>Cha&s;ha,</HI> about half way down. From the Foot of this Mountain to <HI>Athens,</HI> is a very good plain way, and of about ten or a dozen Miles thither, as I believe; for we came not to <HI>Athens,</HI> till near about Noon: fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ing by a Wood of Olive-trees, about three Miles di&s;tant from the Town, with &s;everal plea&s;ant Villages of the <HI>Athenians</HI> in it, and a River run|ning through it.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE DESCRIPTION OF ATHENS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ATHENS</HI> is the chief City of that Province of <HI>Greece,</HI> which was called, in times pa&s;t, <HI>Attica;</HI> a City now reduced to near the lowe&s;t Ebb of Fortune: But of Fame &s;o great, that few Cities in the World can di&s;pute Precedence with her, or few pretend to have been her Equals. For, whe|ther you con&s;ider her Antiquity, Valour, Power, Learning, or any other Quality, that may make a Place illu&s;trious, and renowned in the World, &s;he &s;till &s;eems triumphant. Neither hath any City had a larger &s;hare in good and bad Fortune, than <HI>Athens.</HI> Her People owned no Original, but the Earth they inhabited; and &s;carce allowed the Sun to be elder than they: Nor would they acknowledge to have received their Name from any, but their chief Godde&s;s <HI>Minerva,</HI> whom they knew by the Name of
&Agr;&THgr;&EEgr;&Ngr;&Agr;.
But they planted many Colonies, and gave both Names and Laws to them; of which <HI>Meur&s;ius</HI> reckons to the number of forty.</P>
<P>But the le&s;s credulous among them, and more judicious Hi&s;torians, a|gree, That <HI>Cecrops,</HI> being the fir&s;t that reduced the Inhabitants of <HI>Attica,</HI> the Off-&s;pring of the <HI>Carians</HI> and <HI>Aonians,</HI> under a Political Government, did by the &s;ame means advance him&s;elf to be their King; and as the mo&s;t advantageous Place of his whole Dominions, which contain'd all within the Mountains <HI>Gerania, Oenoa, Parnes,</HI> and <HI>Lycabettus;</HI> that is, from the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> to <HI>Oropus,</HI> near the Mouth of the River <HI>A&s;opus,</HI> cho&s;e this Rock, which is &s;ituated in a large Plain, and near the middle of this Country, to build the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of his Kingdom, calling it, and its whole Territory by his own Name, <HI>Cecropia;</HI> whereas it was called before him, <HI>Actica;</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Ionia,</HI> from <HI>Ion,</HI> the Son of <HI>Xuthus.</HI></P>

<P>This, they &s;uppo&s;e, came to pa&s;s not long after <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, Eight hundred and thirty Years before the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> and about a Thou&s;and, five hundred, and eighty Years before the Incarnation of our Saviour; to which the time that is &s;ince elap&s;ed, being added, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="339" REF="137">a Thou&s;and, &s;ix hundred, &s;eventy eight Years, it will be about Three thou&s;and, two hundred, and fifty Years ago, that <HI>Athens</HI> was built; not to be more exact, than I can ju&s;tify. For even the Chronologers them|&s;elves differ in their Accounts &s;ome Years. The <HI>Marmora Oxonien&s;ia</HI> compute Three thou&s;and, two hundred, and &s;ixty Years. <HI>Helvicus</HI> &s;aith, Three thou&s;and, two hundred, forty &s;ix Years.</P>
<P><HI>Cecrops</HI> divided his Kingdom into twelve principal Cities, and was the Author of many excellent Laws and Con&s;titutions, e&s;pecially touching Marriage. Wherefore they repre&s;ented him like <HI>Janus,</HI> with two Faces, but one Head; &s;ignifying, that the Union between Man and Wife, was &s;uch, that they made but <HI>One Being,</HI> with different A&s;pects. Each of the&s;e twelve Cities had Courts of Judicature, and Magi&s;trates of their own: and were &s;o little &s;ubject to their Princes, the Succe&s;&s;ors and Po|&s;terity of <HI>Cecrops,</HI> that they &s;eldom or never con&s;ulted them, &s;ave only in ca&s;es of &s;ome imminent and publick Danger; and did &s;o ab&s;olutely order their own Concerns, that &s;ometimes they waged War again&s;t each other, without their Kings. But &s;till <HI>Cecropia</HI> was the chief Seat of their Empire, and daily augmented in Riches, Greatne&s;s, and Strength, un|til <HI>Ericthonius,</HI> the fourth King of <HI>Attica;</HI> who being admoni&s;hed by the Oracle, That <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> did &s;trive who &s;hould have the Ho|nour of giving a new Name to his City, put it to the general Vote of his People; wherein both Sexes, Men and Women, having their Voices, the Godde&s;s <HI>Minerva</HI> carried it, and had the Victory by one Vote. So they named the City after her own Name, <HI>Athena:</HI> For &s;o is <HI>Minerva</HI> called by the <HI>Greeks.</HI> In memory hereof the <HI>Attick</HI> Games al&s;o, called <HI>Panathenaea,</HI> came to be publickly celebrated: And from that time the City was called <HI>Athenae,</HI> or <HI>Athens.</HI> This is to be &s;een in abundance of the mo&s;t antient Coyns, and Monuments of this Place, as well as Hi&s;to|ry. Upon the one &s;ide of their Coyns, is the Head of <HI>Minerva,</HI> &s;tamp|ed with her Helmet on, within a Wreath of Olive-branches; and on the other &s;ide an <HI>Owl,</HI> her beloved Bird, in tho&s;e times reckoned the Em|blem of Wi&s;dom; with the&s;e Letters about it, <HI>viz.</HI>

<P>Thus <HI>Athens,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Attica</HI> continued united, until <HI>Pan|dion,</HI> the Second of that Name, and the Eighth <HI>Athenian</HI> King; who dying, by his La&s;t Will and Te&s;tament, divided his Kingdom into four Parts, and left it among&s;t his four Sons, <HI>Aegens, Lycus, Pallas,</HI> and <HI>Ni&s;us.</HI> To his elde&s;t Son, <HI>Aegeus,</HI> he left the Plain, and City of <HI>Athens,</HI> together with the Plaint of <HI>Eleu&s;is</HI> and <HI>Thria&s;ius;</HI> bounded from <HI>Megaris</HI> by the Mountains <HI>Cerato;</HI> from the <HI>Eleutherians,</HI> by the Mountains <HI>Oenoa</HI> and <HI>Paecilus;</HI> and from the <HI>Athenian</HI> Plain, by the Mountain <HI>Coridales;</HI> which al&s;o hath Mount <HI>Parnes</HI> North, the Mountains <HI>Brile&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Pentelicus</HI> North-Ea&s;t; not <HI>Anche&s;mus,</HI> as Mon&s;ieur <HI>De la Gulitier</HI> calls it.

He likewi&s;e reduced all tho&s;e Provinces, which his Father had &s;eparated, and united them again to his Kingdom of <HI>Attica,</HI> making <HI>Athens</HI> his Ca|pital City, and the Seat of the Law, and ordaining all the re&s;t of his People, to appeal thither, if need were, for Ju&s;tice. So having depriv'd all the other Cities of their particular (independent) Senates and Magi|&s;trates, he reduc'd them all to one great Councel, or Senate, at <HI>Athens,</HI> called the <HI>Prytaneum.</HI> For which, and many other publick Benefits, and Heroick Actions, he was after his Death thought worthy to be honour'd with Divine Wor&s;hip, and to have place among&s;t their Tutelar Gods. For which rea&s;on al&s;o, upon the Gate of <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Palace, on that &s;ide towards the City, there is an In&s;cription, &s;ignifying thus much, <HI>This is</HI> Athens, <HI>in times pa&s;t the City of</HI> The&s;eus; and on that &s;ide, which the Emperour <HI>Adrian</HI> had built, is engraven, <HI>This is the City of</HI> Adrian, <HI>and not of</HI> The&s;eus.</P>
<P><HI>Athens</HI> continued a <HI>Monarchy</HI> about Five hundred and fifty Years, un|til the Death of <HI>Codrus</HI> the &s;eventeenth, and la&s;t King; a Prince le&s;s fortunate, than brave. For his Country being attacked by the <HI>Dorians,</HI> he, as the Heathens in tho&s;e days were wont to do, con&s;ulted with the Oracle; which told him, <HI>Tho&s;e &s;hould be Conquerours, who&s;e King was &s;lain.</HI> He thereupon preferring his Countries &s;afety before his own Life, having put him&s;elf into a di&s;gui&s;e, ru&s;hed in among the thicke&s;t of his Enemies, and bravely died to &s;ave his People; which, &s;o &s;oon as it was known, his Enemies turn'd their backs, and retreated without any nota|ble Action. Only in their way home they took <HI>Megara,</HI> and demoli&s;h|ed the Pillar, that <HI>The&s;eus</HI> had &s;et in the <HI>I&s;thmus;</HI> whereon was written on that &s;ide towards <HI>Attica, This is Ionia, and not Peloponne&s;us;</HI> and on the other &s;ide, <HI>This is Peloponne&s;us, and not Ionia.</HI> From which time the <HI>Gerata</HI> Mountains began to be the Bounds of <HI>Attica,</HI> within the <HI>I&s;thmus.</HI> The <HI>Athenians,</HI> in reverence to <HI>Codrus,</HI> would never more have any Go|vernour by the Name, or Title of <HI>King:</HI> but were governed by Magr|&s;trates, they called <HI>Archontes,</HI> for Six hundred Years after; who were, at fir&s;t, for their whole Lives, then changed every ten Years, and after|wards every Year: Under whom they mo&s;t valiantly defended their Li|berty, and Borders, for the &s;pace of Five hundred, and thirty four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marmora Ox|on.</HI> p. 244, 247.</NOTE> Years; until the Tyrant, <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> &s;eized on the Government. But after for|ty Years, his whole Family was bani&s;hed from thence by <HI>Cli&s;thenes Alc|maeonides,</HI> who took the Government upon him by the Name of <HI>Arehon;</HI> and among other things, altered the Number and Names of the<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Herodot.</HI> l. 5.</NOTE> Tribes. After this they had War with the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> and with wonderful Suc|ce&s;s, routed the numerous Armies of <HI>Darius,</HI> and <HI>Xerxes;</HI> and that with incon&s;iderable numbers. in proportion to their Enemies: which they perform'd under the di&s;creet and happy Conduct of tho&s;e valiant Cap|tains, <HI>Miltiades</HI> and <HI>Themi&s;tocles;</HI> at Land, in their wonderful Victory
<PB N="342" REF="139">of <HI>Marathon,</HI> obtain'd again&s;t a Million of Men; of which, 'tis &s;aid, not Fifty thou&s;and e&s;caped; and by Sea, in the Fight at <HI>Salamis,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Xerxes</HI> his Navy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodot.</NOTE> But in their Wars with the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> they were not &s;o Fortunate: For the&s;e took <HI>Athens,</HI> and impo&s;ed over them for Governours thirty Tyrants. But from this di&s;graceful condition they were &s;oon delivered by the Policy and Valour of <HI>Thra&s;ibulus;</HI> and, at la&s;t, by the Help of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> under that brave General <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Leuctra,</HI> they &s;o perfectly &s;ubdued the <HI>Spartans</HI> their Enemies, that they could never recover them&s;elves again. In&s;omuch that the <HI>A|thenians</HI> became Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Seas, and of the greate&s;t part of the I&s;les therein, going on Conquerours even to the Borders of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and had, as <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> reports, a thou&s;and Cities under them. They held the Sovereignty of <HI>Greece</HI> for Three&s;core and ten Years; but kept it no longer, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> and <HI>Thebans,</HI> emulating their Greatne&s;s, and &s;tirring up Factions and Divi&s;ions in <HI>Greece</HI> again&s;t them. At which time neverthele&s;s, the <HI>Eleutherians</HI> voluntarily joyned them&s;elves to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pan&s;an.</NOTE> partly out of &s;pite to the <HI>Thebans,</HI> and partly out of a great liking they had taken to the <HI>Athenian</HI> way of Govern|ment.</P>
<P>But at length, all &s;ides being grown weary of fighting, and a general Peace concluded, the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;oon began to &s;light the Vertue of their Ance&s;tors, and to give them&s;elves over to Luxury and Idlene&s;s, loving their Ea&s;e &s;o much, that they made it Trea&s;on for any to propo&s;e the Re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hing of their Army, or the rai&s;ing any Money for the maintenance of it; preferring a lucky Satyri&s;t, before the brave&s;t Captain; and to hear a Play, before the gaining of the greate&s;t Conque&s;t: Which degenerous Di&s;po&s;ition of theirs, in a &s;hort time, gave opportunity and lei&s;ure to the <HI>Macedonians</HI> to advance their Monarchy, and extend it by little and little over all <HI>Greece;</HI> a De&s;ign projected by <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> the Fa|ther; but atchieved and perfected by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, his Son. <HI>Phi|lip</HI> brake their Power at Sea, and took from them the <HI>Aegean</HI> I&s;lands; and they tamely permitted his Son, <HI>Alexander,</HI> to deprive them of what remained by Land, to &s;uch a degree of Subjection, as to di&s;arm them of their very Tongues, by re&s;training them from talking in their Publick Meet|ings; by &s;o much, no doubt, more grievous to them, by how much they naturally loved, and u&s;ed the Liberty of that Member. For who &s;uch Wits in all <HI>Greece,</HI> as the <HI>Athenians?</HI> who &s;uch Talkers? who &s;o Pragmatical, and bu&s;ie in all Affairs? And, to give many of them their due, none &s;o Eloquent and Learned. After the Death of <HI>Alexander,</HI> they endeavour'd to recover their Liberty, but without any great Succe&s;s. Under the Protection of the <HI>Romans,</HI> they enjoyed it in &s;ome compe|tent mea&s;ure; until &s;iding with <HI>Mithridates.</HI> King of <HI>Pontus,</HI> in his un|&s;ucce&s;sful Wars, they again lo&s;t it, and quite ruined them&s;elves. For <HI>Sylla</HI> being inform'd, That they voluntarily took <HI>Mithridates</HI> his part, in his Rage, put the greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants to the Sword; and had de&s;troyed all, had not the Night favour'd the E&s;cape of &s;ome. He &s;et fire on <HI>Piraeum</HI> and <HI>Munichia,</HI> and &s;pared neither &s;acred nor profane Pla|ces in his Fury. After this they were unfortunate al&s;o in taking the weak|er &s;ide, in the Wars between <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Pompey.</HI> But <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was no le&s;s a merciful, than a fortunate and valiant Conquerour; he pardoned
<PB N="343" REF="139">the Living for the &s;akes of the Dead. But after his Death they &s;hew|ed them&s;elves mo&s;t ungrateful to his Memory, in erecting Statues to his Murderer <HI>Brutus.</HI> But this co&s;t them the I&s;le of <HI>Aegina,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> came to &s;ucceed in the Empire. In the Reign of <HI>Tiberius, Germa|nicus,</HI> his adopted Son, pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Athens,</HI> treated them as <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Allies</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and honour'd them with the Priviledge of having a Lictor; which is a mark of Sovereign Power. <HI>Caligula,</HI> his Son, be|ing in the Throne, took away their Image of <HI>Jupiter Olympius,</HI> and cau|&s;ed it to be brought to <HI>Rome;</HI> where he brake off the Head of the God, and &s;et his own upon the Trunk.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Claudius,</HI> Succe&s;&s;our to <HI>Caligula,</HI> S^t <HI>Paul</HI> came to <HI>Athens;</HI> and having in his way from the Port to the City, ob&s;erv'd an Altar, as the In&s;cription &s;hewed, <HI>dedicated to the unknown God,</HI> he took occa&s;ion to preach unto them God, <HI>the Creator of all things;</HI> whom, till then, they had wor&s;hipped in Ignorance. To who&s;e Preaching the great <HI>Dio|ny&s;ius,</HI> a Senator of the chief Court <HI>Areopagus,</HI> joyn'd him&s;elf, and be|came the <HI>Fir&s;t-Fruits of the Faith</HI> in that City. And therefore de&s;er|vedly appointed by S^t <HI>Paul</HI> to be their Fir&s;t Bi&s;hop; having now added Divinity to his Philo&s;ophy. And this was conformable to the Apo&s;tles Practice, as S^t <HI>Clement</HI> informs us, in his Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> And this was the fir&s;t Foundation of the Church of Chri&s;t in <HI>Athens.</HI> For <HI>Athens</HI> till then was the Seminary of &s;uper&s;titious Temples, and fal&s;e Wor&s;hip; of which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> gives an ample De&s;cription; and <HI>Pliny</HI> in his time a&s;&s;ures us, There were no le&s;s than three Images wor&s;hipped there.</P>
<P><HI>Nero,</HI> to &s;hew his Ingenuity among&s;t the <HI>Greeks,</HI> made a Voyage into <HI>Achaia,</HI> and, without doubt, &s;pent no &s;mall time at <HI>Athens.</HI> My Com|rade is of opinion, That a &s;ingular Medal he hath &s;een, where the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;tile <HI>Nero, The Saviour of Mankind,</HI> was coined at <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> reduc'd <HI>Achaia</HI> to be a Province of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, ob|liging them to be Subject to the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, and to be governed by a <HI>Procon&s;ul;</HI> to one of whom, named <HI>Rufus Fe&s;tus,</HI> an In&s;cription up|on a great Stone near the Temple of <HI>Minerva</HI> is dedicated. Yet under the Emperour <HI>Trajan,</HI> this Province of <HI>Achaia,</HI> as well as other Places of <HI>Greece,</HI> enjoyed at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;hew of Liberty; as appears by a Letter, which <HI>Pliny</HI> wrote to one <HI>Maximus,</HI> who was &s;ent thither by the Senate to be their Governour. The Tenor of which Epi&s;tle, is as followeth: <Q><HI>Remember,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that you are going into</HI> Achaia, <HI>the proper and true</HI> Greece; <HI>That you are appointed to govern a State of free Cities, who have maintained their Liberty by their Valour. Take not away any thing of their Priviledges, their Dignity, no nor yet of their Pre&s;umption. But con&s;ider, it is a Country, that hath of long time given Laws, and recei|ved none. That it is to</HI> Athens <HI>thou goe&s;t; where it would be thought a barbarous Cruelty in thee, to deprive them of that &s;hadow, and name of Liberty, which as yet remaineth to them.</HI></Q> But &s;o it was, notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e, and &s;ome other like Indulgences, which they had from &s;everal Emperours, they could never perfectly recover them&s;elves from the &s;ad Effects of <HI>Sylla</HI>'s Cruelty, until the time of <HI>Hadrian,</HI> who being advanc'd to the Imperial Dignity, with great Munificence re&s;tor'd this City to its former Beauty: The rea&s;on whereof was, That in his younger Years he
<PB N="344" REF="140">had been cho&s;en <HI>Archon;</HI> that is, the chief Magi&s;trate there; and had taken &s;uch a particular Affection to the Place, that being now made Em|perour, and vi&s;iting the Provinces, he &s;taid a con&s;iderable time at <HI>A|thens,</HI> and gave them many Priviledges; as their publick Games, which in honour of him were call'd <HI>Adrianalia,</HI> and a thou&s;and Wild Bea&s;ts eve|ry year to hunt in the <HI>Stadium,</HI> building him&s;elf a Palace there, with a publick Library and Schools, for teaching the Liberal Arts and Sciences; con&s;ecrating a Temple to <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno, Panellenians;</HI> and al&s;o build|ing another of va&s;t Magnificence, to <HI>Jupiter Olympius:</HI> In fine, This Emperour not only rebuilt or repaired tho&s;e publick Buildings, that Time, and the Wars had either defac'd or ruin'd; but added al&s;o, at his own charge, one whole Region of Buildings to the City, &s;o large and beautiful, that it de&s;erved to be call'd afterwards <HI>New Athens,</HI> as it is on his Aqueduct.</P>
<P><HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> fini&s;hed this famous Aqueduct of white Marble, which this Emperour, <HI>Hadrian,</HI> had begun. <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> augmented the number of publick Profe&s;&s;ors in the Schools, and would be &s;olemnly ini|tiated among them. Only the Emperour <HI>Septimius Severus</HI> thought not fit to continue the Kindne&s;s of his Predece&s;&s;ors to them; but bare them a Grudge even to his dying day; for no greater Rea&s;on, as 'tis thought, than &s;ome little Affront he received from them in his Youth, when he was there either out of Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Place, or at his Study. But whatever it was, it co&s;t them a great part of their Priviledges.</P>
<P>The Emperour <HI>Valerian,</HI> who reigned long after <HI>Severus,</HI> permitted them to rebuild their Walls: which yet could not hinder the <HI>Scy|thians</HI> from making them&s;elves once Ma&s;ters of the City. But it was but for a &s;hort time: For the brave <HI>Cleodemus,</HI> rallying the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;cat|ter'd Forces, rai&s;ing a new Army, and getting together &s;ome Ships, &s;et up|on, and &s;oon put to flight the Army of tho&s;e Barbarians.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Chri&s;tian Emperours, <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Fir&s;t was their great Friend and Benefactour, honouring their Governours with the Title of <HI>Arch-Duke.</HI> From the Bounty of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Second, they obtain'd &s;everal I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> Under the Reign of <HI>Arcadius,</HI> they pa&s;&s;ed the common Fate of the re&s;t of <HI>Greece;</HI> as likewi&s;e of all <HI>Italy,</HI> being &s;ack'd and pillag'd by <HI>Alarick,</HI> King of the <HI>Goths,</HI> as <HI>Syne&s;ius</HI> &s;aith; who lived in the &s;ame Age, and compares <HI>Athens</HI> at that time to an Animal, who&s;e Entrails are con&s;um'd with Rottenne&s;s. Yet <HI>Zozimus</HI> &s;ays, That <HI>Alarick</HI> &s;pared <HI>Athens,</HI> as fan&s;ying that he &s;aw <HI>Achilles,</HI> that famous <HI>Hero,</HI> and Captain General of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> fighting for them upon the Walls. <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI> was a good Friend to them. But in the following Ages, until the Thirteenth Century, there is deep &s;ilence of them, either for want of Hi&s;torians, who, in tho&s;e Times, were few and ob&s;cure; or that it plea&s;ed Divine Providence, to give them &s;uch a long term of Privacy and Peace, as that little notice was taken of their Affairs, in relation to the re&s;t of the World. In the Thirteenth Century, I know not upon what Offence, <HI>Theodorus La&s;caris,</HI> the then <HI>Greek</HI> Emperour, be&s;ieged it; but was repul&s;ed. After him, one &s;tiled <HI>The Marque&s;s Bonifacius</HI> took it: But how long he held it, or who took it from him, appears not. It was afterwards governed by one <HI>Delves,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Arra|gon.</HI> But he dying, the <HI>Turks,</HI> under the Command and Conduct of <HI>Ba|jazet,</HI>
<PB N="345" REF="140">their Emperour, took it with <HI>Boeotia;</HI> and were within a while di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it again, by that valiant Chri&s;tian Souldier, <HI>Reinerius Ac|ciaiolo,</HI> a <HI>Florentine;</HI> who reduced it under the State of <HI>Venice.</HI> But they, not having had it long, it was, upon &s;ome Differences happening, retaken from them by <HI>Anthony,</HI> a natural Son of <HI>Reinerius.</HI> The Fami|ly of the <HI>Acciaioli</HI> were Ma&s;ters of <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Boeotia,</HI> a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time. For <HI>Nerius,</HI> a Cou&s;in of <HI>Anthony,</HI> &s;ucceeded him; and after <HI>Nerius,</HI> another <HI>Anthony,</HI> Brother to <HI>Nerius;</HI> and after him <HI>Fran|cus:</HI> From whom it fell under the Dominion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the time of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second, in the Year 1455. for want of Succour; which the <HI>Greeks</HI> in vain de&s;ired of the <HI>Latines;</HI> who would do nothing for them upon other terms, than their Conformity in Religion, and renoun|cing tho&s;e Points, wherein they differ'd from them: little con&s;idering, that the <HI>Turks</HI> made <HI>Greece</HI> but a &s;tep, to bring them &s;o much nearer to <HI>Italy;</HI> and that they were &s;worn Enemies to Chri&s;tianity in general, and not to the <HI>Greeks</HI> only. They have been ever &s;ince under the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tyranny; and are like &s;o to continue, until God &s;hall re&s;tore them to Liberty: which is far beyond the reach of Human Policy to conceive how, or by what means it &s;hould be; &s;o long as Chri&s;tendom is &s;o di&s;|united in it &s;elf, and that Divine Providence, for our Sins, permitteth the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Arms and Super&s;tition &s;o mightily to prevail. They, poor People, bear their pre&s;ent Affliction with as much Quietne&s;s, and Chri|&s;tian Patience, as they did in times pa&s;t &s;hew Courage and Magnanimi|ty, in maintaining their Liberty. And this brings me to con&s;ider what the pre&s;ent Condition of <HI>Athens</HI> is; having, with all the &s;peed I could, run over the Accounts, which the Antients have given more at large of her various Fortune.</P>
<P>Although the antient Greatne&s;s of <HI>Athens</HI> is vani&s;hed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Name.</NOTE> and remains on|ly a Story in <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> and &s;ome other antient Writers, Time and Fate having devoured the Sub&s;tance; yet &s;he &s;till retains her antient Name, with little or no Alteration. For they &s;till call the City <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>[Athene,]</HI> which they pronounce <HI>[Athini.]</HI> Therefore I wonder, our Modern <HI>Geographers</HI> have been no better inform'd concerning &s;o eminent a Place, calling it mo&s;t corruptly in their Maps, &s;ometimes <HI>Saithenes,</HI> otherwhile <HI>Setines,</HI> and <HI>Satina,</HI> &amp;c. deceived, as I have before ob&s;erved, by the ig|norant Seamen; who, hearing the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;ay, <GAP DESC="foreign">, they pro|nounce <HI>Stin Athini,</HI> have form'd tho&s;e barbarous Names out of their own Brains.</P>
<P><HI>Athini,</HI> or <HI>Athens,</HI> is &s;ituated in almo&s;t the middle of a large Plain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation.</NOTE> which, &s;o much as it wants in Fruitfulne&s;s, is recompen&s;ed with Health and Beauty. It hath the Mountain <HI>Parnes</HI> North, called now <HI>Cha&s;ha</HI> and <HI>Nozea; Pentelcus,</HI> or <HI>Pendely,</HI> North-Ea&s;t, about &s;ix Miles di&s;tant; <HI>Hy|mettus,</HI> or <HI>Telo-bouni,</HI> from Ea&s;t to South, about five Miles from it; Port <HI>Phalera,</HI> We&s;t South-We&s;t, four Miles; and <HI>Porto-Leone,</HI> or <HI>Pyraeas,</HI> We&s;t by South, five Miles: the Hills <HI>Coridalia,</HI> now <HI>Daphni Bouni,</HI> from We&s;t to almo&s;t North, at &s;ix or &s;even Miles di&s;tance. Nearer to the Town it hath a little pointed Rock, called from a Chapel there is on the top, <HI>[Tou Hagiou Georgiou vouni,]</HI> S^t <HI>Georges Mountain:</HI> which might, in times pa&s;t, be that which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> calleth <HI>Anche&s;mus,</HI> a little Moun|tain:
<PB N="346" REF="141">Not, as the <HI>French</HI> Author of the <HI>New and Old Athens</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Pen|telicus,</HI> covered with Woods, and where the Quarries of Marble are: For here, upon this Mountain of S^t <HI>George,</HI> are neither Woods, nor Quar|ries; being only a bare Rock, lying about a Mile off the Town, Ea&s;t North-Ea&s;t. It hath the Chanel of the River <HI>Ili&s;&s;us</HI> running by it, South-Ea&s;t, and turneth round it South, and South-We&s;twards, by the Hill called, in times pa&s;t, the <HI>Mu&s;aeum;</HI> and is about a Bow-&s;hot, South-We&s;t, of the <HI>Acropolis,</HI> or Ca&s;tle. Whence it falls into another Stream; which, ri&s;ing by &s;everal Fountains from Mount <HI>Parnes</HI> and <HI>Pentelicus,</HI> runneth by the City, North-Ea&s;t, about three Miles di&s;tant from it; and wate|ring, in its pa&s;&s;age, a Wood of Olive trees, of at lea&s;t half a dozen Miles long, and one or two broad: which is now the greate&s;t Wealth and Ornament of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Plain. It is not ea&s;ie to determin, whether this River &s;hould be called <HI>Cephi&s;us,</HI> or <HI>Eridanus. Strabo</HI> plainly calleth it <HI>Cephi&s;us:</HI> But our Geographers, of late and modern Times, make it <HI>Eridanus;</HI> with whom I will not, for the pre&s;ent, di&s;pute. Only, I mu&s;t tell them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Latitude.</NOTE> They are out in their Latitude of <HI>Athens,</HI> whatever they are in their Longitude. For they place it in <HI>Thirty Seven</HI> Degrees Latitude, and <HI>Fifty Three</HI> Longitude: whereas M^r <HI>Vernon</HI> found it to be <HI>Thirty Eight</HI> Degrees, <HI>Five</HI> Minutes Latitude.</P>
<P>The Cittadel that now is, was at fir&s;t all the City, having no other Inhabitants, but &s;uch as dwelt within tho&s;e Walls: Afterwards, in times of its greate&s;t Pro&s;perity, it was no more than the Ca&s;tle, or <HI>Acropolis,</HI> &s;tanding in the middle of the City. And &s;till it continueth to be the Ca&s;tle, even in this low E&s;tate; though it cannot, at pre&s;ent, be &s;aid to &s;tand in the middle of it; but rather &s;omewhat above it to the South-We&s;t: the re&s;t encompa&s;&s;ing, in antient times, being quite de&s;troyed. So that the pre&s;ent Town lieth not round about the Ca&s;tle, as antiently, but to the North-We&s;t &s;ide of it; being now &s;pread on the Plain under it in length, I believe, a Mile and half, in breadth &s;omewhat above a Mile; and is e&s;teem'd four Miles in Circumference. It hath no Walls to defend it &s;elf; in&s;omuch that they have been frequently &s;urpriz'd by the Pirates from Sea, and &s;u&s;tained great Lo&s;&s;es from them: Until &s;ome Years &s;ince, they &s;ecured all the Avenues into the Town by Gates, which they built anew, and made the utmo&s;t Hou&s;es, lying clo&s;e together, to &s;erve in&s;tead of Walls. The&s;e they now &s;hut up every night; and are by them rea&s;onably well &s;ecured from tho&s;e <HI>Cor&s;airs.</HI> The Hou&s;es are very clo&s;e built together, and the Streets very narrow. The whole is di|vided into Eight Quarters, or Pari&s;hes; which they call <HI>Platoma;</HI> be|&s;ides the Ca&s;tle. Their Names, and Situation, are the&s;e which fol|low.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fir&s;t is called <HI>Placa,</HI> and is &s;ituate on the South-Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Town. It hath in it the Monument called <HI>The Lanthorn of Demo&s;thenes,</HI> the Church entituled <HI>Hagio-Kyra,</HI> and the Con&s;ul's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Second is called <HI>Sotiras Tou Kotaki;</HI> and lieth Ea&s;twards, to|wards the Church <HI>Lycodemou.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Third <HI>Monoca Luptis.</HI> This is about the middle of the Town: wherein is the New <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> called <HI>Tis Baciras,</HI> from a Widow Woman of that Name, who built it.</P>
<PB N="347" REF="141">
<P N="4">4. The Fourth <HI>Roumbi;</HI> which is about the Church <HI>Panagia, Ca|coumeria,</HI> and the Place where they burn Lime.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Fifth is <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Platoma,</HI> on the North-Ea&s;t-&s;ide, towards the Church <HI>Hagio Theodoro,</HI> and the Pillar <HI>Hagios Johannis.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Sixth <HI>Boreas Platoma;</HI> which is the North Quarter, by the Church called <HI>Chry&s;o&s;pilioti&s;a.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The Seventh <HI>Hagii Colymbi,</HI> is North-We&s;twards, towards the Tem|ple of <HI>The&s;eus</HI> and <HI>Eleu&s;is.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The Eighth <HI>Gerlada,</HI> is under the Ca&s;tle, about the Church <HI>Hagio Nicolao.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e the Ca&s;tle being added, <HI>Athens</HI> is not &s;o de&s;picable a Place, that it &s;hould de&s;erve to be con&s;ider'd only as a &s;mall Village, according to the Report of &s;ome Travellers; who, perhaps, have &s;een it only from Sea, through the wrong end of their Per&s;pective-Gla&s;. For from the Sea the Ca&s;tle is only perceivable; which hideth all the re&s;t of the Town, &s;pread out upon the Plain, North of it. But if it be compared with the former State, when it took up a con&s;iderable Part of the Plain, was joyned to its two Ports, <HI>Phaleracus</HI> and <HI>Pyraeus,</HI> by its two long Walls; one four Miles in length, the other five, <HI>Munichia</HI> being joyn'd to <HI>Pyraea</HI> between them; when it gave Laws to other Nations, but re|ceived none; when it was the Seat of the Mu&s;es, of Wit, Eloquence, and Learning; where all Arts and Sciences &s;eem'd to be born, nur&s;ed up, and brought to their full State, and heighth of Perfection: Indeed tho&s;e that &s;hall thus con&s;ider <HI>Athens,</HI> will find the Scene quite changed; Philo&s;ophers being now more rigorou&s;ly bani&s;hed thence by Fate, than they could ever be in old time by the ill Humours of their Governours. For the <HI>Athenians</HI> have had their &s;hare in the ill Fortune of all tho&s;e no|ble Cities of the Ea&s;t; the Fury of the De&s;troyer having ca&s;t them al&s;o down, although not utterly extingui&s;h'd them. Indeed I have &s;een but few Towns in <HI>Turky,</HI> that have pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves &s;o well as this, nor that enjoy greater Priviledges under the Tyranny of the <HI>Turks.</HI> True it is, &s;ome other Cities, by Trading, &s;eem more Rich than <HI>Athens.</HI> But I attribute this rather to the bad Fortune of the Place, than to want either of good Harbours, or good Merchandize, to export, or vend for &s;uch as may be imported.</P>
<P>They count their Town, as I &s;aid, four Miles in compa&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Athenians</HI> Quality and Numbers.</NOTE> and e&s;teem them&s;elves Eight, or Ten thou&s;and Inhabitants, whereof three Parts are Chri&s;tians, the re&s;t <HI>Turks:</HI> No <HI>Jews</HI> among them; nor would they ever admit any to inhabit with them, although it hath often been attempted. For this mu&s;t, with great truth, be &s;aid of them: Their bad Fortune hath not been able to take from them, what they have by Nature; that is, much natural Subtilty, or Wit; of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural Wit.</NOTE> the Serenity and Good|ne&s;s of the Air they enjoy, may be a great natural Cau&s;e; as I doubt not, but it is of the Healthine&s;s of the People: which is &s;uch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Health.</NOTE> that it is com|monly ob&s;erv'd, that when the Pe&s;tilence is round about them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From good Air.</NOTE> at <HI>Thebes, Negropont, Napoly, Corinth,</HI> &amp;c. it &s;eldom, or very rarely cometh thither. Their natural Dexterity, in all the little Matters they undertake, &s;hews it &s;elf extraordinary; as in buying, &s;elling, and all their Dome&s;tick Af|fairs; and not a little al&s;o in Publick, con&s;idering the Circum&s;tances they are in. For finding their <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Governours were &s;till too hard for
<PB N="348" REF="142">them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priviledges.</NOTE> and &s;till impo&s;ing upon them, notwith&s;tanding the Priviledges they had capitulated for at their Surrender, and dearly purchas'd after|ward; they about thirty Years ago, not without &s;ome Difficulty, and with no &s;mall Co&s;t, obtain'd the Protection of the <HI>Kizlar Haga,</HI> or Chief of the <HI>Black Eunuchs;</HI> who thereupon is become their Patron, and whom they appeal to upon any Difficulty, or Abu&s;e put upon them by the <HI>Turks.</HI> It is he, that orders whom he will to be their <HI>Veivode,</HI> their <HI>Caddi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governours.</NOTE> <HI>Haga</HI> of the Ca&s;tle. The <HI>Veivode</HI> receiveth the Revenue of <HI>A|thens,</HI> and payeth to the <HI>Kizlar Haga</HI> for his place Thirty thou&s;and Crowns a Year; and is worth to him&s;elf, over and above, Five thou&s;and Crowns, all Charges and Expences defrai'd. He is changed every Year, commen|cing his Charge upon the beginning of <HI>March.</HI> This Revenue is rai&s;ed out of the <HI>Cu&s;toms, Caratchs, Weights</HI> of the Town, <HI>Avenies</HI> or <HI>Amerce|ments, Tenths,</HI> and <HI>Vellanies;</HI> which are the Cups of Acorns I before &s;pake of, and wherewith they Tan their Leather. Tho&s;e al&s;o, that carry any Merchandize to any Fair, as <HI>Mo&s;coluri,</HI> &amp;c. mu&s;t pay him a certain Du|ty fir&s;t. About fifty Years pa&s;t, the <HI>Caratch,</HI> or <HI>Poll-money,</HI> was certain at four Dollers and a half every Head; but lately the <HI>Veivodes</HI> have rai&s;|ed it to five Dollers here, as well as in mo&s;t other Places of <HI>Turky.</HI> The other Officers are the <HI>Sardar;</HI> who commands the Janizaries of <HI>Athens,</HI> and of the Country Adjacent. The <HI>Spahi Aga,</HI> who commands the <HI>Spa|hies,</HI> or <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e; and holds certain Lands of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> for that Service. The <HI>Di&s;dar,</HI> or <HI>Haga</HI> of the Ca&s;tle, hath no other Au|thority, than over the <HI>Neferides,</HI> or Souldiers of the Garri&s;on; who have their Lodgings in the Ca&s;tle. The <HI>Caddi</HI> is Judge of all Cau&s;es, and Dif|ferences among them, whether between <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or both. The <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> indeed endeavour to avoid the &s;evere Tribunal of the <HI>Turks,</HI> as much as in them lies; and to that purpo&s;e have compo&s;ed a little Body politick among them&s;elves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy.</NOTE> For having divided the Town into Eight Quarters, as I &s;aid, out of every one of the&s;e, one of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial, and reverend antient Men is cho&s;en, whom they call <HI>Epitro|pi.</HI> The&s;e Eight moderate all Concerns in a friendly manner between <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and to the&s;e they commit all their Publick Af|fairs of moment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Families.</NOTE> The <HI>Benninzellies,</HI> the <HI>Palaeologues,</HI> the <HI>Limbonai,</HI> the <HI>Perouli,</HI> and the <HI>Cavalaris,</HI> are the chief Families of <HI>Athens;</HI> and gene|rally one out of each of the&s;e, is cho&s;en <HI>Epitropos.</HI> The <HI>Chalcocondylas,</HI> whom they now call <HI>Charcondyli,</HI> are but in a low condition. <HI>Stamati Charcondyli,</HI> who is de&s;cended from the Hi&s;torian of that Name, who wrote the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks,</HI> is a Merchant, who lives ordinarily at <HI>Mizi&s;tra,</HI> in the <HI>Morea;</HI> but hath a Hou&s;e at <HI>Athens. Polimeno Zarli</HI> is al&s;o a Merchant, well enough to pa&s;s, but was never <HI>Epitropus:</HI> no more than <HI>Capitanuki;</HI> who is a very civil Man, and counted Rich. But they &s;eldom come to that Degree of Dignity, till they are antient grave Men, and let their Beards grow to their full length. For then they begin to be honoured with the Name, or Titles of <HI>Geronti</HI> and <HI>Archonti,</HI> and to wear a high-crown'd black Hat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habits.</NOTE> made of &s;uch kind of &s;tuff, as the Turky-Carpets are, and generally the &s;ame Habit with the <HI>Epitropi.</HI> The ordinary Habits of the other <HI>Athenians,</HI> is only a Skull-cap; which &s;ometimes they turn up with white, and a long black Ve&s;t; rarely any other colours. Over their Ve&s;t is another loo&s;e Coat, commonly lined
<PB N="349" REF="142">with Furs; which they hang on their Shoulders. On their Feet and Legs they wear a thin black Boot; which they &s;et in Wrinkles about their Legs. They never wear <HI>Papouches,</HI> or Slippers, like the <HI>Turks;</HI> nor <HI>Turbants.</HI> The Women wear a long Coat to their Feet, of red, or &s;ome other colour'd Cloth; not girded abou them, but loo&s;e; almo&s;t as high as their Brea&s;ts; and is hung on their Shoulders, with a Bodice &s;ewed to it, without any &s;tiffne&s;s or &s;traitne&s;s. Over this they have a &s;hort Ve&s;t of Silk, or fine Woollen Cloth, and &s;ometimes Cloth of Gold, lined with &s;ome rich Fur, and adorned before with Buttons as big as Wallnuts, of beaten Silver, and &s;ometimes Silver gilded. Their Hair cu|riou&s;ly plaited, and braided down behind, as low as the bending of their Knees; having al&s;o, for the mo&s;t part, Ta&s;&s;els of le&s;&s;er Silver-Buttons, tied to the ends of the Braids. When they go to Church, they cover their Faces with a thin Linnen Vail.</P>
<P>Although the little Hope the <HI>Athenians</HI> have, of ever gaining their Liberty from the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Tyranny, con&s;trains them to live peaceably un|der their Government, without running into Rebellion again&s;t them, or &s;omenting any Factions in the State; yet does their old Humour of Jea|lou&s;ie &s;till continue: which, though they wi&s;ely moderate by Rea&s;on &s;o far, as not to be tran&s;ported thereby into any Publick Mutiny again&s;t the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> they now owne for their Emperour; yet they forbear not to &s;hew them&s;elves &s;en&s;ible of the Injuries committed by his Mini|&s;ters, and to complain of them; and, with notable Indu&s;try, to pro&s;e|cute the Vindication of their own Right. An Example of which, not unworthy of Ob&s;ervation, happened about the time we were there. The <HI>Veivode,</HI> new come into his Place, to get up the Sum of Money he had lately parted with to the <HI>Kizlar Haga</HI> for his Office, mo&s;t greedily and tyrannically, without regard either to Right or Wrong, impo&s;ed new Cu&s;toms and Taxes upon them, and their Merchandizes: and to that effect was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Haga</HI> of the Ca&s;tle, and three others, that were Brothers, and principal <HI>Hagaes</HI> of <HI>Athens;</HI> who, con&s;piring together, brought the poor <HI>Athenians</HI> daily into &s;ome trouble&s;om <HI>Aveny</HI> or other, meerly to get Money out of them.

Thalanta</HI> is on the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Boeotia,</HI> on the Gulph of <HI>Negropont;</HI> to which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Guilitier,</HI> who hath created him &s;even Suffragans, hath added the I&s;land <HI>Scirus;</HI> with four other Names, altogether unknown to the <HI>Greeks.</HI> M^r <HI>Smith</HI> hath <HI>Mendinitza</HI> in his Catalogue, in&s;tead of <HI>Bodi|nitza.</HI> I know not which of us is mi&s;taken; for mine, and my Comrade's Information was <HI>Bodinitza.</HI> I was afterwards informed, That another Town, called <HI>Granitza,</HI> upon a Mountain near <HI>Livadia,</HI> was a Bi&s;hop|rick al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenue.</NOTE> and belonged to the Province of <HI>Athens.</HI> The pre&s;ent Revenue of the Arch-Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Athens,</HI> is Four thou&s;and Dollers a Year, as we were informed both by the Con&s;ul, and a <HI>Pappa,</HI> that had always lived with the Arch-Bi&s;hop; which the Arch-Bi&s;hop him&s;elf owned, when we were to wait on him. The Arch-Bi&s;hop him&s;elf owned, when we were to wait on him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who then Arch-Bi&s;hop.</NOTE> The Arch-Bi&s;hop, that then reigned, was called <HI>Antenos,</HI> a Native of the <HI>Morea;</HI> and is e&s;teemed among them a wi&s;e, and learned Man: which, in my Opinion, he made the greate&s;t Proof of, when he refu&s;ed the Dignity of the Patriarchal-Seat of their Church. For though that be a far greater Honour, and is much canva|&s;ed for by the <HI>Grecian</HI> Metropolitans; yet all things con&s;idered, the Profit is not &s;o great, as to de&s;erve that they &s;hould &s;o &s;trive for it: be|ing, as their pre&s;ent Condition is, a Charge of great Perplexity and Dan|ger. He under&s;tands the antient <HI>Greek</HI> moderately well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Learning.</NOTE> and hath read, as they &s;ay, &s;ome of the Fathers: But I found him much Latinized. He told me, He was one of tho&s;e, that &s;igned the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> lately made by the Patriarch of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Grecian</HI> Bi&s;hops, then pre&s;ent. He is a Man very much re&s;pected here, and lives more at his Ea&s;e, than any of his Quality I have ob&s;erved in <HI>Greece:</HI> Although all Chri&s;tians there, pay a wonderful deal of Re&s;pect to their Bi&s;hops, and whole Clergy. I wi&s;h, I could &s;ay half &s;o much, of the Laity of <HI>England;</HI> who, in all Gratitude, ought to &s;hew it, being &s;o extreamly more obli|ged to our Clergy, than they are to theirs. He hath &s;ome three or four <HI>Caloires,</HI> to wait upon him; and hath a good Hou&s;e upon the Hill, near the We&s;t end of the Ca&s;tle; which, they &s;ay, belonged to S^t <HI>Denis</HI> the <HI>Areopagite:</HI> where he entertain'd us civilly, receiving us after the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Fa&s;hion; that is, making us &s;it upon a <HI>Sopha,</HI> and drink <HI>Coffee</HI> with him. He told us, He had a con&s;iderable number of Manu&s;cripts; but had &s;ent the greate&s;t part of them to the Convent of S^t <HI>Luca.</HI> He &s;hewed us only one, being S^t <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> his Works, with the Comment of S^t <HI>Maximus,</HI> well written upon Vellom; and, as we judged by the hand, five or &s;ix hundred Years old. The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> offer'd him fifty Dollers for it; but he e&s;teemed it more. My Comrade, and I found two other Copies of the &s;ame Author, that co&s;t le&s;s Money, and plea&s;ed us as well.</P>
<P>They count to the number of Two hundred Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Churches.</NOTE> in, and about <HI>Athens;</HI> whereof Fifty two have their particular Prie&s;ts belonging to them; wherein they ordinarily read their Liturgies; the re&s;t are &s;el|dom u&s;ed, but upon certain times, and days of the Founders, and Be|nefactours; and are but as &s;o many Oratories, or &s;mall Chapels. The <HI>Catholicon,</HI> as they call their Cathedral Church, is &s;ituated on the North|&s;ide of the Town, between S^t <HI>John</HI>'s Pillars, and the <HI>Ba&s;ar</HI>-Street. It is the be&s;t kept in repair, and the be&s;t adorn'd of any; although, in
<PB N="351" REF="143">reality, but mean; and &s;uch, as for Stateline&s;s, and Magnificence of Fabrick, would be found to exceed very few ordinary Pari&s;h-Churches in <HI>England;</HI> only it is indifferently well adorn'd, according to their Mode. They had their Pictures, and carving of their Skreen done at <HI>Venice.</HI> The Skreen &s;eparates the Body of the Church from the Holy-place; on the top of which &s;tand four Storks, made of gilded Wood, put there for Ornament, or to &s;ignify the Piety and Care of good Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors, who watch over their Flocks out of true and tender Love to their Souls, and not for Lucre &s;ake only. For they u&s;e no carved Fi|gures, to do any Reverence to them. Here I &s;aw the Arch-Bi&s;hop wa&s;h the Feet of his Prie&s;ts, in imitation of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Humility, on <HI>Maundy-Thur&s;day,</HI> at his In&s;titution of the Holy Sacrament. The Ceremony is thus performed: Twelve of the Elde&s;t <HI>Pappaes</HI> of the Town, accompany the Arch-Bi&s;hop to the Church; where he is ve&s;ted in a Violet-colour'd Robe, and &s;eated on his Throne, until &s;ome part of the Service is pa&s;t: after which he de&s;cendeth, and entreth into the Ho|ly Place, with the Twelve Prie&s;ts, that attended him thither: and then changing the Robe he had on for another more Rich, returneth again to his Throne. The Prie&s;ts al&s;o have their &s;everal colour'd Robes, re|pre&s;enting each of them his particular Apo&s;tle. Out of the&s;e, &s;ome ve|nerable Old Man, with white Head and Beard, is cho&s;en to repre&s;ent S^t <HI>Peter;</HI> who &s;itteth fir&s;t of the Twelve, and on the right hand: There is al&s;o &s;ome other, red bearded, or ill-look'd Fellow appointed to repre|&s;ent <HI>Judas.</HI> Some while after this, the Bi&s;hop retires him&s;elf; and put|ting off his rich Robes, tieth a Linnen Towel about him, and with a Ba&s;in of Water in his hand, cometh to the Apo&s;tles, and offers to wa&s;h their Feet. But he that repre&s;enteth S^t <HI>Peter,</HI> ri&s;eth up, and refu&s;eth to be wa&s;hed; u&s;ing tho&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle in the Go&s;pel, <HI>John</HI> 13.9. <HI>Lord, thou &s;halt never wa&s;h my Feet.</HI> To which the Bi&s;hop, repre&s;enting Chri&s;t, an&s;wereth in tho&s;e words of our Saviour's, related in the Go&s;pel; <HI>If I wa&s;h thee not, thou ha&s;t no part with me.</HI> Upon which the Prie&s;t &s;its down, and permits Chri&s;t to wa&s;h his Feet, exactly according to the Dialogue that is in the Go&s;pel, touching this matter. But coming to <HI>Judas,</HI> the Bi&s;hop maketh a little &s;top, and pau&s;eth a while, as willing to give the Traytor time, better to con&s;ider what he was going about; and then, in conclu&s;ion, he wa&s;heth his Feet al&s;o. Then with &s;ome <HI>An|thems</HI> and <HI>Collects,</HI> they conclude the Ceremony.</P>
<P>We could by no means tell, why the <HI>French</HI> Author of <HI>Old and New Athens,</HI> &s;hould dream, That this was the Temple of <HI>Vulcan:</HI> For we &s;ound nothing antient to &s;hew it, nor any Tradition to confirm it, more than the Product of his Fancy: No more could we at the <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> &s;ome di&s;tance Ea&s;t from it, &s;ee any rea&s;on to make us call it <HI>The Temple of Venus &V;rania;</HI> although &s;uch a Temple might probably have been at that End of the Town, which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, was called <HI>The Gardens,</HI> towards th <HI>I yeaeum;</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter. The re&s;t of the Churches above-mentioned, as in or near to <HI>Athens,</HI> have nothing ex|traordinary in them; only being, for the mo&s;t part, compo&s;ed of an|tient Fragments, there are often found In&s;criptions about them.</P>
<P>They have &s;everal Convents, &s;ome for Men, and &s;ome for Nuns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convents.</NOTE> they call <HI>Calogrega's.</HI> One of the&s;e is &s;ituated on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Town:
<PB N="352" REF="144">where I was admitted to &s;ee the Body of a Woman, they e&s;teem a Saint, upon the ground of &s;ome <HI>Vi&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>Apparitions,</HI> they confidently af|firm, that they have had concerning her, &s;ince her Death. The <HI>Capu|cins</HI> have a little <HI>Ho&s;pitium,</HI> or Cell here, adjoyning to the <HI>Lanthorn of Demo&s;thenes;</HI> where a Mi&s;&s;ionary or two of that Order, do re&s;ide. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> once had the like; but they, not finding the Employment they look'd for, procur'd them&s;elves to be removed to <HI>Negropont.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have five <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> here;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo&s;ques.</NOTE> four in the Town, and one in the Ca&s;tle. The <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> of the <HI>Bazar,</HI> in the middle of the Town, is the be&s;t of them. But that in the Ca&s;tle, transform'd from <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Temple to the u&s;e of a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> is, without compari&s;on, the fine&s;t in the World. They have al&s;o a kind of Convent for Votaries in their Super|&s;tition.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o three or four publick <HI>Bagnio's,</HI> or Baths, much u&s;ed here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagnio's.</NOTE> as in mo&s;t other eminent Towns in <HI>Turky.</HI> The Town is well wa|tered by Chanels under ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water.</NOTE> brought from the <HI>Ili&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Eridanus:</HI> I mean, from Mount <HI>Hymettus;</HI> and di&s;per&s;ed about the City into &s;e|veral publick Fountains, and private Hou&s;es. That in the Street of the <HI>Bazar,</HI> is the mo&s;t eminent, and bears the Name of <HI>&V;&s;&s;in Che|lebi.</HI></P>
<P>All &s;orts of Provi&s;ions are good cheap here;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi&s;ions.</NOTE> whether Corn, Wine, Oyl, Mutton, Beef, Goats-Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, or Fowl; e&s;pecially Partridges and Hares are in great abundance here: And &s;hould any Scarcity happen, the <HI>Morea,</HI> not far di&s;tant, and the fat Plains of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> as near at hand, would be able to furni&s;h them. They fi&s;h with a little Light in their Boat, which the Fi&s;hes &s;eeing, follow; which the Fi&s;herman perceiving, pre&s;ently &s;trikes the Fi&s;h with a <HI>Trident,</HI> like to that they paint <HI>Neptune</HI> with, and &s;uch as is found &s;tamped in many antient Medals. The Men are &s;o dextrous at this Sport, that they &s;eldom mi&s;s a Stroke, and catch great quantities of Fi&s;h in one Night. We gave Orders for &s;ome to be caught for us, in the Lent, and they brought us the next Morning three|&s;core pound weight of &s;everal &s;orts of admirable good Fi&s;h, &s;uch as I do not remember to have &s;een in our Seas; and &s;old us it for le&s;s than a Penny a pound: and yet they made us pay &s;omewhat more, than they u&s;ually &s;ell it for, becau&s;e it was caught on purpo&s;e for us.</P>
<P>Their Wine al&s;o is very good here;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine.</NOTE> but they put a little Pitch in it, to pre&s;erve it; which is not very plea&s;ant, until one is u&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>Their Olives too are excellent good; e&s;pecially one &s;ort of them, which they call <HI>Colybades;</HI> becau&s;e they &s;till peel them. The&s;e they e&s;teem very much, being near as big as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Olives; yet not of quite &s;o oval a Figure; but rather of the &s;hape of a <HI>Jujuba.</HI> They are a &s;ort of Olives, that will never come to be ripe there; and therefore are pickled green: but &s;o well e&s;teemed, that many of them are carried to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Court, as a great rarity.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Athens</HI> is but &s;mall at pre&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade.</NOTE> and con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly in little Matters among them&s;elves. But it would &s;oon be greater, had they Vent for their Commodities. A Li&s;t of what they export, and their Prizes, were given me by <HI>Con&s;ul Giraud;</HI> who a&s;&s;ured me, That if Mer|chants would &s;end Ve&s;&s;els thither, they would find great Profit.</P>
<PB N="353" REF="144">
<P>Their Merchandizes are the&s;e that follow:</P>
<P>Oyl, as good as any in the <HI>Levant,</HI> is here in great abundance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchandizes.</NOTE> and will co&s;t, all Charges con&s;ider'd, aboard, <HI>Three&s;core Dollers</HI> the <HI>Tonclade;</HI> which is a Thou&s;and, &s;even hundred, &s;ixty five Pounds weight.

<P>Turky-Leather, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Boufeloes,</HI> and tho&s;e according to their big|ne&s;s and goodne&s;s, <HI>Fourteen</HI> or <HI>Fifteen Dollers</HI> the Quintal.</P>
<P>Four or five &s;orts of Raw Silk, fine and cour&s;e, are made here.</P>
<P><HI>Pernocochi,</HI> which I think is Scarlet-grains for dying, <HI>Two Dollers</HI> the <HI>Oka;</HI> which is about Forty two Ounces.</P>
<P><HI>Pitch, Tar,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;in,</HI> about Three Shillings the Quintal.</P>

<P>And &s;everal other &s;orts of Merchandizes; which, being le&s;s con&s;ide|rable, I omit.</P>
<P>The Merchandizes, which bear be&s;t Prices to be imported there, are the&s;e which follow:</P>
<P><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth they call <HI>Londroes,</HI> are &s;old ordinarily at <HI>Seventy</HI> and <HI>Eighty Dollers</HI> the Piece; and the more fine, the better Price they bear, in proportion. The proper colours for the&s;e parts are Red, Blue, Green, Black, Purple, and Violet.</P>
<P>Tin will give <HI>Thirty five,</HI> and <HI>Thirty eight Dollers</HI> the Quintal.</P>
<P>Lead, <HI>Seven</HI> or <HI>Eight Dollers</HI> the Quintal.</P>
<P>Pepper, <HI>Thirty</HI> or <HI>Thirty two Dollers</HI> the Quintal.</P>
<P><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sugar, at <HI>Twenty two Dollers</HI> the Quintal.</P>
<P>Cinamon and Cloves &s;ell but few here. The&s;e la&s;t are worth <HI>Seven</HI> or <HI>Eight Dollers</HI> the <HI>Oka;</HI> the other, <HI>Five</HI> or <HI>Six.</HI></P>
<P>I was willing to be thus particular upon the Account of the <HI>Con&s;ul;</HI> who de&s;ired me to encourage our Merchants, to &s;end Ships thither.</P>
<P><HI>Tartans</HI> of <HI>Mur&s;eilles</HI> come often hither; but <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships &s;eldom. Yet our <HI>Con&s;id</HI> expected one, when we were there; which came ju&s;t as I parted thence. I &s;aw it come into the <HI>Saronique</HI> Gulph: but did not believe, it came from <HI>England;</HI> otherwi&s;e I had laded more Marbles on it, than the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> did by my Order.</P>
<P>How famous <HI>Athens</HI> hath been for Learning, is unknown to none,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Learning.</NOTE> that know any thing of antient Learning; and concerning this Subject, I have already given, in general, an Account of its pre&s;ent low conditi|on, as well as of all <HI>Greece.</HI> But here I will be yet more particular; and &s;ince I may without Vanity &s;ay, I went to School at <HI>Athens,</HI> I will al&s;o &s;hew you, how I learned my Book there, beginning with <HI>ABC,</HI> and pro|ceeding as far as I learned. The <HI>Greeks</HI> u&s;e near upon the &s;ame Alpha|bet, that is ordinarily in u&s;e among us; yet not without &s;ome Diffe|rences. But as to the Pronunciation, when they read the Schola&s;tick <HI>Greek,</HI> they differ very much from the ordinary way, that our Schools
<PB N="354" REF="145">teach. Whether their Pronunciation or ours, is true&s;t, that is, mo&s;t agreeable to the Antient, I will not di&s;pute, much le&s;s take upon me to determine: &s;ince no Art hath yet been found out, to pre&s;erve Sounds without Corruption or Alteration. But I will tell you, how at pre&s;ent they pronounce their Letters, and Syllables, comparing them with our pre&s;ent Characters.</P>

<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> never pronounce <HI>&Bgr;,</HI> as the <HI>Francks</HI> commonly do that Letter, but always like the <HI>V</HI> con&s;onant. And our Errour, doubtle&s;s, proceeds chiefly from the Likene&s;s of the Character. I believe the anti|ent <HI>Greeks</HI> did pronounce it &s;o al&s;o: For in Medals, when they would write <HI>Valerianus,</HI> they writ
&Bgr;&Agr;&Lgr;&Egr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Agr;&Ngr;&Ogr;&Slungr;,

<P>The&s;e are the Differences I can call to mind, at pre&s;ent.

I will only &s;ay, It were to be wi&s;h'd, that our Schools would teach the Modern way of pronouncing <HI>Greek,</HI> as well as the Antient. For it would be a great Help to tho&s;e that travel into tho&s;e Parts, or in|tend to be under&s;tood of the Modern <HI>Greeks</HI> at home. And who knows, but in time it may plea&s;e God to excite the Piety of &s;ome good Men, to go and preach the Purity, and Sincerity of the Holy Go&s;pel to tho&s;e poor Chri&s;tians; who &s;eem, at pre&s;ent, to be buried in Ignorance, and overwhelmed with <HI>Roman</HI> Super&s;tition, who&s;e Sectators encompa&s;s Sea and Land, to gain Pro&s;elytes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;eem to retain more of the Antient <HI>Greek</HI> in their Lan|guage, than the re&s;t of the Modern <HI>Greeks</HI> do; and have abundance of <HI>Greek</HI> words, which tho&s;e, who have had great Conver&s;e with the <HI>I|talians,</HI> u&s;e not: But yet they do not well under&s;tand the Antient <HI>Greek.</HI> For when we were at <HI>Athens,</HI> there was only the Arch-Bi&s;hop, who is &s;ince dead, and my Ma&s;ter <HI>Ezechiel,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Cyriani;</HI> who were known to under&s;tand it. This la&s;t hath indeed more Learning, than I thought to meet with at <HI>Athens;</HI> for he under&s;tands <HI>Latine</HI> competently well, and &s;omething al&s;o in <HI>Philo&s;ophy;</HI> but &s;eems not to have &s;tudied <HI>Divini|ty</HI> over much.

<P>As to the eminent Monuments of Antiquity, yet remaining at <HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquities.</NOTE> I dare prefer them before any Place in the World, <HI>Rome</HI> only excepted. Therefore I will in the next place con&s;ider them, giving you the be&s;t and true&s;t Account my Ob&s;ervations will enable me; beginning our Sur|vey, fir&s;t, with the <HI>Acropolis,</HI> or Ca&s;tle; being &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of all the re&s;t, and the mo&s;t antient and eminent Part of <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Acropolis,</HI> or Ca&s;tle, is built upon a long Rock, with Precipices every way from it, except on the North-We&s;t end; where you mount by a &s;teep A&s;cent, to the Entrance; and which is better fortified than the re&s;t, by high and thick Walls. The whole Rock, which is Oval, is about Twelve hundred ordinary Paces in circumference, and al&s;o &s;ur|rounded with Walls of very antient Work, e&s;pecially the Foundations of it, making an <HI>Area</HI> twice as long as broad. About Two hundred Paces lower, yet not quite to the bottom of the Hill, are di&s;tinctly to be &s;een the Foundations of other Walls, encompa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t almo&s;t quite round: which I believe to be tho&s;e built by <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> who fir&s;t enlar|ged the City. One Gate of which &s;tandeth on the South-&s;ide, and two others, con&s;i&s;ting of va&s;t Stones, on the North, and North-Ea&s;t &s;ides; al|though the Walls them&s;elves are almo&s;t even with the Ground. And it may be demon&s;trated both by the Monuments of Antiquity yet remaining, and out of Hi&s;tory, that <HI>Athens</HI> had yet a far greater Wall, than either of the&s;e, including this &s;econd Wall, and encompa&s;&s;ing the whole City; &s;pread out far and wide above it; to which two other long Walls, one reaching to <HI>Pyraea,</HI> and the other <HI>Phalarea,</HI> were joined, as hath been &s;aid. It was with great difficulty, we obtain'd the Favour of &s;eeing the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Haga;</HI> who being newly come thither, and &s;carce well &s;ettled in his Place, knew not whether he might &s;afely gratify us. But an old Souldier of the Ca&s;tle, his Friend and Con&s;ident, for three <HI>Oka's</HI> of <HI>Coffee,</HI> two to the Governour, and one to him&s;elf, per&s;waded him at la&s;t to give way; a&s;&s;uring him, it was never refu&s;ed to &s;uch Strangers,
<PB N="358" REF="147">as it appear'd that we were. The <HI>Haga</HI> hath for his Garri&s;on about an hundred <HI>Turks</HI> of the Country, who re&s;ide there with their Families; and are always on their Guard, for fear of Pirats, who often land there, and do a great deal of Mi&s;chief. Wherefore all Night, a part of them by turns, go the Rounds of the Walls, making a great hallowing and noi&s;e, to &s;ignifie their Watchfulne&s;s, and that if Pirats, or other Ene|mies come, they are ready to receive them. The&s;e Soldiers are called <HI>Neferides,</HI> or <HI>I&s;arlides</HI> in <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;triani</HI> in <HI>Greek;</HI> not <HI>Janizaries.</HI> I e&s;teem this Ca&s;tle of no great Strength for the&s;e Times; and that by rea&s;on of the Hill <HI>Mu&s;aeum,</HI> which lieth South-We&s;t of it, of equal height with it, and being within Cannon-&s;hot.</P>
<P>We went up to the Ca&s;tle from the Town, mounting by degrees, and winding about it, till we came at the Entrance, which is at the North-We&s;t end of the Rock. Within the fir&s;t Gate I ob&s;erv'd, in the Walls, two Figures in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo,</HI> that joyned hands; which we gue&s;&s;ed to be a Man, and his Wife, giving to each other their la&s;t Farewel, as is &s;ome|times &s;een in antient Monuments; with this word in <HI>Latine, Vale;</HI> and in <HI>Greek,</HI> XAIPE, or <HI>Adieu.</HI> Thence mounting a little further, through a narrow Court, with a Covert on the &s;ide of it for the Guards, we came to the &s;econd Gate, over which is a <HI>Tran&s;eant</HI> of Marble, with an In|&s;cription on it of one <HI>Flavius Marcellinus,</HI> that rebuilt the Gates of the Town at his own Charges: Perhaps, meaning only the Gates of the <HI>Acro|polis;</HI> for that, as <HI>Thucydides</HI> ob&s;erves, was called the City al&s;o, after the re&s;t was built.</P>

<P>When we had pa&s;&s;ed the Second Gate, we ob&s;erved &s;ome antient Foun|dations; which we gue&s;&s;ed, might be of the <HI>Propylaea,</HI> or <HI>Outward Gate:</HI> which was &s;o glorious a Structure, that it's &s;aid to have co&s;t a Million of <HI>Drachma's</HI> to build it. Thence, through another &s;mall Court, the way brought us to the Third Gate; over which was a <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo</HI> of an Eagle, the En&s;ign of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sovereignty: the Goodne&s;s of who&s;e Work &s;hews it to be antient. After we had pa&s;&s;ed this Gate, we were quite within the <HI>Acropolis;</HI> where the fir&s;t thing we ob&s;erved, was a little Temple on our right hand; which we knew to be that dedicated to <HI>Victory without Wings.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suidas <HI>in</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> It is built of white Marble, with one end near the Wall; where 'tis &s;aid, that <HI>Aegeus</HI> ca&s;t him&s;elf down at the &s;ight of the Black Sails, his Son <HI>The&s;eus</HI> forgot to change, when he returned Vi|ctorious from the Combate with the Minotaur in <HI>Crete.</HI> It was therefore &s;tiled <HI>Without Wings;</HI> becau&s;e the Fame thereof arrived not at <HI>Athens,</HI> be|fore <HI>The&s;eus</HI> him&s;elf, that brought it. For otherwi&s;e, Victory u&s;ed &s;till to be repre&s;ented <HI>with Wings.</HI> This Temple is not above fifteen Foot long, and about eight or nine broad: But of white Marble, with chanel'd Pil|lars of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order. The Architrave hath a <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo</HI> on it, of little Figures well cut; and now &s;erveth the <HI>Turks</HI> for a Magazin of Powder.</P>
<PB N="359" REF="147">
<P>Almo&s;t over again&s;t this, is another noble Edifice of white Marble; which hath the Reputation to have been the Armory of <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> and, they &s;ay, was u&s;ed for an Armory many Years together, both by the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and <HI>Turks:</HI> until about twenty Years ago, it was blown up by Gun-powder kept in it; for which the <HI>Greeks</HI> keep an Anniver&s;ary Thanks-giving-day: telling, That a certain <HI>Haga</HI> of the Ca&s;tle, a zea|lous Enemy to Chri&s;tianity, re&s;olved one day to batter down a Church; who having prepared all things in readine&s;s over Night to do the inten|ded Execution next day, being a Fe&s;tival according to their Law, they meant thus maliciou&s;ly to celebrate, by the Ruin of a Chri&s;tian Church: But were the &s;ame Night miraculou&s;ly prevented by Thunder and Light|ning from Heaven; which &s;et the Powder on Fire, and blew part of the Roof, whereon the <HI>Haga's</HI> Hou&s;e &s;tood, together with him, and his whole Family, up into the Air; a Girl only excepted, who was &s;aved, and is &s;ince married to a <HI>Turk</HI> of <HI>Athens.</HI> The next day they found Bows and Arrows, Shields, and other Armour, all about the Country: But ne|ver heard they any News of the <HI>Haga</HI> again. The Walls of the Build|ing held fa&s;t, being of white Marble, very thick, and &s;trongly cemented together; yet were they &s;o crack't in &s;ome Places, that one may thru&s;t ones hand through them. But that part of the Building towards the Front, which looketh We&s;twards, received no harm, either Walls or Roof. The whole Structure is white Marble, and you mount up to it by five or &s;ix &s;teps; whereof only one remains entire. The <HI>Eagle</HI> of the Front is fa&s;hioned like other Temples, &s;u&s;tained by four Pillars of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Eagle</HI> is the high Angle of the Front of a Temple, where the <HI>Ro|man Eagle</HI> u&s;ed to be placed.</NOTE>. On each hand this Front, are placed two &s;quare Turrets, who&s;e &s;ides next the Steps are &s;u&s;tained by Pillars of the &s;ame Order, as they yet remain on the Nor|thern Tower: above which is built now the <HI>Haga's</HI> Lodgings; but the Sou|thern Tower is ruined, and hath another high one built upon its antient Foundations, appearing &s;ome Ranges of Stone above Ground. The re&s;t is a mixture of broken Rubbi&s;h, rai&s;ed upon it a good height: But one may conclude, there were antiently two very beautiful Towers rai&s;ed on them. The <HI>Pronaae</HI> is a large &s;quare Room, who&s;e Roof within is held up by four beautiful <HI>Ionick</HI> Pillars, &s;u&s;taining two great Marble Beams, which are covered with large Marble Planks. But whether this was that <GAP DESC="foreign">, that Building, which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, is on the left hand of the <HI>Propylaea,</HI> full of Pictures, or painted Work, is hard to &s;ay; and as hard to determin, that it was indeed a Temple. For tho&s;e Founda|tions of Towers on each hand of the Front, is a thing extraordinary, and what I never &s;aw belonging to any Temple. Be&s;ides this, although it is on the left hand of the Temple of <HI>Victory,</HI> it is that which pre&s;ents it &s;elf to view before it. The Towers on each &s;ide of the Front, per&s;wade me very much, that it was the famous <HI>Propylaea.</HI></P>

<P>We could hardly &s;tay here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEMPLE OF MINERVA, or PARTHE|NION.</NOTE> to make all the Ob&s;ervations we might have done, we were &s;o impatient to go to the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> the chief Godde&s;s of the <HI>Athenians;</HI> which is not only &s;till the chief Orna|ment of the Cittadel; but ab&s;olutely, both for Matter and Art, the mo&s;t beautiful piece of Antiquity remaining in the World.

<P>This Temple is called by <HI>Pan&s;anias, Parthenion;</HI> becau&s;e the Godde&s;s <HI>Minerva,</HI> to whom it was dedicated, profe&s;&s;ed Virginity. It is &s;ituated about the middle of the Cittadel, and con&s;i&s;ts altogether of admirable white Marble. The Plane of it is above twice as long, as it is broad; be|ing Two hundred, and &s;eventeen foot, nine inches long, and ninety eight foot, &s;ix inches broad. It hath an A&s;cent, every way, of five Degrees, or Steps; which &s;eem to be &s;o contrived, to &s;erve as a <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> to the <HI>Per|tico;</HI> which is &s;upported by chanelled Pillars of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, ere|cted round upon them, without any other <HI>Ba&s;is.</HI> The&s;e Pillars are For|ty &s;ix in number, being eight to the Front, and as many behind, and &s;eventeen on each &s;ide, counting the four corner ones twice over, to be deducted. They are Forty two foot high, and &s;eventeen foot and a half about. The Di&s;tance between Pillar and Pillar, is &s;even foot, and four inches. This <HI>Portico</HI> beareth up a Front, and Frize round a|bout the Temple, charged with Hi&s;torical Figures of admirable Beauty and Work. The Figures of the Front, which the Antients called the <HI>Eagle,</HI> appear, though from that height, of the natural bigne&s;s; being
<PB N="361" REF="148">in entire <HI>Relievo,</HI> and wonderfully well carved. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith no more of them, than that they concern the Birth of the Godde&s;s <HI>Minerva.</HI> What I ob&s;erved, and remember of them, is this.</P>
<P>There is a Figure, that &s;tands in the middle of it, having its right Arm broken, which probably held the Thunder. Its Legs &s;tradle at &s;ome di|&s;tance from each other; where, without doubt, was placed the <HI>Eagle:</HI> For its Beard, and the Maje&s;ty, which the Sculpture hath expre&s;&s;ed in his Countenance, although tho&s;e other u&s;ual Characters be wanting here, do &s;ufficiently &s;hew it to have been made for <HI>Jupiter.</HI> He &s;tands na|ked; for &s;o he was u&s;ually repre&s;ented, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Greeks.</HI> At his right hand is another Figure, with its Hands and Arms broken off, co|vered down half way the Leg, in a po&s;ture as coming towards <HI>Jupiter;</HI> which, perhaps, was a <HI>Victory,</HI> leading the Hor&s;es of the Triumphant Cha|riot of <HI>Minerva,</HI> which follows it. The Hor&s;es are made with &s;uch great Art, that the Sculptor &s;eems to have outdone him&s;elf, by giving them a more than &s;eeming Life: &s;uch a Vigour is expre&s;s'd in each po&s;ture of their prauncing, and &s;tamping, natural to generous Hor&s;es. <HI>Minerva</HI> is next repre&s;ented in the Chariot, rather as the Godde&s;s of <HI>Learning,</HI> than <HI>War,</HI> without Helmet, Buckler, or a <HI>Medu&s;a's</HI> Head on her Brea&s;t, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> de&s;cribes her Image within the Temple. Next behind her, is another Figure of a Woman &s;itting, with her Head broken off. Who it was, is not certain. But my Companion made me ob&s;erve the next two Figures, &s;itting in the Corner, to be of the Emperour <HI>Adrian,</HI> and his Empre&s;s <HI>Sabina;</HI> whom I ea&s;ily knew to be &s;o, by the many Medals and Statues I have &s;een of them.</P>
<P>At the left hand of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> are five or &s;ix other Figures, my Comrade taketh to be an A&s;&s;embly of the Gods; where <HI>Jupiter</HI> introduceth <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI> and owneth her for his Daughter. The <HI>Po&s;tick,</HI> or <HI>Hind-front,</HI> was adorned with Figures, expre&s;&s;ing <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Conte&s;t with <HI>Neptune,</HI> about the naming of the City of <HI>Athens:</HI> But now all of them are fallen down, only part of a Sea-Hor&s;e excepted. The Architrave is al&s;o charged with a <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo,</HI> at &s;everal di&s;tances, divided into Squares of about two or three foot broad, and three or four foot high. That towards the South, is charged, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> affirmed, with the Repre&s;entation of the Wars of the Giants, who inhabited the narrow Streights of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and <HI>Pallenis;</HI> the <HI>Athenian's</HI> War with the <HI>Amazons.</HI> their Victory of <HI>Ma|rathon,</HI> and their Conquering of the <HI>Gauls</HI> in <HI>My&s;ia.</HI> Where I find the Interpreter of <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> hath erred, in tran&s;lating the&s;e words; <HI>In eo Arcis muro, qui ad Au&s;trum ver&s;us e&s;t:</HI> for it &s;hould be, <HI>In eo muro,</HI> not <HI>Arcis,</HI> but <HI>Templi: In that Wall of the Temple, which is towards the South.</HI> For it is of the Temple he is di&s;cour&s;ing, and of the Statues in it. This al&s;o agrees with what follows, <HI>viz.</HI> That each of them are con|tained in &s;paces of two Cubits di&s;tance <GAP DESC="foreign">. By the &s;ame Author I learn, That this was done by the Munificence of <HI>Attalus,</HI> King of <HI>My&s;ia;</HI> and the &s;ame, that was by the Oracle told, He &s;hould be King of <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Taurica;</HI> and whom the <HI>Athenians</HI> honoured, by calling one of their Tribes after his Name; of who&s;e Riches, and Mag|nificence, <HI>Suidas</HI> telleth great things. But it was <HI>Pericles,</HI> that fir&s;t built this Temple, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his <HI>Cato</HI> telleth, and employed <HI>Jctimus</HI> and <HI>Callicrates,</HI> for his Architects: Which, perhaps, was meant by him only
<PB N="362" REF="149">of the <HI>Cella,</HI> or Body of the Temple; to which <HI>Attalus</HI> added this Mag|nificent <HI>Portico.</HI> But the Emperour <HI>Adrian</HI> mo&s;t probably repaired it, and adorn'd it with tho&s;e Figures at each Front. For the whitene&s;s of the Marble, and his own Statue joyned with them, apparently &s;hew them to be of a later Age, than the fir&s;t, and done by that Emperours com|mand. Within the <HI>Portico</HI> on high, and on the out&s;ide of the <HI>Cella</HI> of the Temple it &s;elf, is another Border of <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo</HI> round about it, or at lea&s;t on the North and South-&s;ides; which, without doubt, is as an|tient as the Temple, and of admirable work; but not &s;o high a <HI>Relievo;</HI> as the other. Thereon are repre&s;ented Sacrifices, Proce&s;&s;ions, and other Ceremonies of the Heathens Wor&s;hip. Mo&s;t of them were de&s;igned by the Marque&s;s <HI>De Nantell;</HI> who employed a Painter to do it two Months together, and &s;hewed them to us, when we waited on him at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI> The <HI>Cella</HI> of the Temple without, is a Hundred and fifty eight foot long, and broad Sixty &s;even foot. Before you enter into the Bo|dy of the Temple from the Front, is the <HI>Pronaos,</HI> who&s;e Roof is &s;u&s;tain|ed by &s;ix chanelled Pillars of the &s;ame order, and bigne&s;s with tho&s;e of the <HI>Portico,</HI> and contains near the third part of the <HI>Cella;</HI> to wit, Forty four foot of the length. We ob&s;erved in place of one of the Pillars, a great pile of Stone, and Lime, of mo&s;t rude work; which they told us, the <HI>Kizlar-Haga</HI> had ordered to be &s;o done, to help to &s;upport the Roof; becau&s;e he could never find a Stone big enough to &s;upply the place of the old Pillar, broken down; although he had &s;pent Two thou&s;and Crowns to do it.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o we &s;aw upon another Pillar two In&s;criptions; One was in Honour of <HI>Lucius, Egnatius, Victor, Lollianus;</HI> who had been publick Oratour at <HI>Athens:</HI> The other is of a <HI>Procon&s;ul</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> called <HI>Ru|fus Fe&s;tus;</HI> whom the <HI>Athenians</HI> had honoured with the Title of <HI>Are<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|pagite.</HI></P>

<P>My Comrade found the &s;ame <HI>Rufus Fe&s;tus</HI> by another In&s;cription he met with at <HI>Rome,</HI> to have been a <HI>Roman</HI> of Quality, born at <HI>Vul&s;inium,</HI> a little Town in the way between <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> now called <HI>Bol&s;ina:</HI> where his Epitaph is in Ver&s;e, and, as he believes, of his own; becau&s;e he was a Poet: &s;ome of who&s;e Works are yet extant, under the Name of <HI>Fe&s;tus Avienus.</HI> There is al&s;o a great Ve&s;&s;el of white Marble, and cu|rious Work, which might have been a Font, to Baptize in, in time pa&s;t: But not as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Guiliter</HI> affirmeth, for Holy-Water. For the <HI>Greeks</HI> u&s;e no &s;uch thing in their Churches, although they do at home; being made once a Year in the Church. Here hang al&s;o &s;ome few Lamps, that the <HI>Turks</HI> carry into the Temple, when they do their Night-Devo|tions. From the <HI>Pronaos</HI> we entred into the Temple, by a long Door in the middle of the Front. But my Companion, and I were not &s;o much &s;urprized with the Ob&s;curity of it, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Guiliter;</HI> becau&s;e the Ob&s;ervations we had made on other Heathen Temples, did make it no new thing unto us, as I ob&s;erved at <HI>Spalato.</HI> And that the Heathens loved Ob&s;curity in their Religious Rites and Cu&s;toms, many Rea&s;ons may be gi|ven; e&s;pecially, becau&s;e by that means the Pomps they expo&s;ed to the People, had much advantage by it; and the Defects of them, with all their juggling and cheating, were le&s;s expo&s;ed to view. When the <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> con&s;ecrated it to &s;erve God in, they let in the Light at the Ea&s;t end; which is all that it yet hath. And not only that, but made a Se|micircle for the Holy Place, according to their Rites; which the <HI>Turks</HI> have not yet much altered. This was &s;eparated from the re&s;t by Ja&s;par Pillars; two of which, on each &s;ide, yet remain. Within this Chancel is a Canopy, &s;u&s;tained by four Porphyry Pillars, with beautiful white Marble Chapters, of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order. But the Holy Table under it, is removed. Beyond the Canopy are two or three Degrees, one above another, in a Semicirle; where the Bi&s;hops and Presbyters u&s;ed to &s;it in time of Communion, upon certain Solemn days. The Bi&s;hop &s;ate in a Marble Chair, above the re&s;t; which yet remaineth above the Degrees, again&s;t the Window. Towards the bottom of this Window, are tho&s;e marvelous Stones Mon&s;ieur <HI>Guiliter</HI> makes &s;uch a Miracle of. They are only of a tran&s;parent Marble; which <HI>Pliny,</HI> in the Thirtieth Book of his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory,</HI> calleth <HI>Phengites;</HI> and &s;aith, It was found in <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> in <HI>Nero</HI>'s time, who built a Temple of it to Fortune; which was Light, when the Doors were &s;hut. By rea&s;on of its Natural Tran&s;parency; an ob&s;cure Light pa&s;&s;eth through it; and &s;everal Holes being made deep in it, it makes the Light look of a reddi&s;h, or yellowi&s;h colour. But as to its &s;hining in the Night, that's a Wonder was never heard of until now; and for his comparing it to the Brightne&s;s of a Carbuncle, it may pa&s;s for one of his <HI>Hyperbolies;</HI> our Eyes being much too dim, to di&s;cover it. This &s;ame Author hath made many other Ob&s;ervations, whereof we could find but very little, or no probability; as the In&s;cription on this Temple, <HI>To the unknown God,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> Pilgrimages to it, with &s;everal others, not worth mentioning, and hardly to be excus'd from the Impu|tation of manife&s;t Untruths. On both &s;ides, and towards the Door, is a kind of Gallery, made with two Ranks of Pillars, Twenty two below, and Twenty three above. The odd Pillar is over the Arch of the En|trance, which was left for the Pa&s;&s;age. It being now turn'd into a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI>
<PB N="364" REF="150">the Niche of the <HI>Turks Devotion</HI> is made in the Corner on this &s;ide of the Altar, on the right hand; by which is their Place of Prayer: and on the other &s;ide a Pulpit, to read their Law in; as is u&s;ual in all <HI>Mo&s;ques.</HI> The <HI>Turks,</HI> according to their mea&s;ure of Wit, have wa&s;hed over the beau|tiful white Marble within, with Lime. At one &s;ide of the Quire, there are four Pre&s;&s;es made in the Wall, and &s;hut up with Doors of Marble They &s;ay, None dares open them; and that one undertaking to do it, immediately died the fir&s;t he opened; and that the Plague &s;oon after followed in the Town. The Marque&s;s of <HI>Nantell</HI> would have it attem|pted the &s;econd time; but the &s;crupulous <HI>Turks</HI> would not permit him. They think, there is &s;ome Trea&s;ure there; perhaps, there may be &s;ome Church-Ve&s;tments, Books, or Plate, belonging to the Altar; which now, in the poor <HI>Greek</HI> Church, is &s;eldom much above a Chalice, and a &s;mall Sil|ver Plate. They &s;hewed us the place, where two Orange-trees of Mar|ble had &s;tood; which being taken thence to be carried to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the Ve&s;&s;el mi&s;carried with them. The Roof over the Altar and Quire, added to the Temple by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> hath the Picture of the Holy Vir|gin on it, of <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work, left yet by the <HI>Turks;</HI> becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, a certain <HI>Turk</HI> having &s;hot a Mu&s;quet at it, his hand pre&s;ently withered. This Temple was covered outwardly with great Planks of Stone; of which &s;ome are fallen down, and are to be &s;een in the <HI>Mo&s;que.</HI> They have built a <HI>Minoret,</HI> or tall, &s;lender Steeple; out of which they make a Noi&s;e, to call People together, at their &s;et times of Prayer, day and night: On the top of which I mounted, and had a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Pro|&s;pect of the Cittadel, City, Plain, and Gulph of <HI>Egina,</HI> with the Coa&s;ts, and Harbours round about. But i dur&s;t not &s;tay long to enjoy the &s;ight, for fear of being &s;een my &s;elf, and taken for one, that had other de|&s;igns, than of meer Curio&s;ity. After &s;ome &s;mall while therefore de&s;cen|ding, we left the Temple of <HI>Minerva;</HI> having fir&s;t made a Pre&s;ent of &s;ome few <HI>Timins</HI> to the <HI>Turk,</HI> who had been &s;o civil to permit us &s;uch a free, and fair Examination of all the My&s;teries, and Rarities of it.</P>
<P>Going therefore &s;ome way further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEMPLE OF ERICTHEUS.</NOTE> among&s;t the Buildings, and Ruins, on the North-&s;ide of the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> we came to the Temple of <HI>Erictheus.</HI> It is known to be that, by two Marks out of <HI>Pau&s;anias:</HI> Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e he &s;aith, It is a <HI>Double Building,</HI> one bigger than the other, as this yet remains. The le&s;&s;er one, by which the Entrance is to the other, is Twenty nine foot long, and Twenty one foot, three inches broad. The bigger is Sixty three foot, and a half long, and Thirty &s;ix foot broad. Its Roof is &s;u&s;tained by <HI>Ionick</HI> Pillars, chanelled; but the Chapters are &s;omething different from any I have &s;een of that Order; and &s;eem to be a kind of mixture between it, and the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order. The other Mark is, that, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, There is a Well of Salt-Water in it; which he makes no wonder of, becau&s;e there are many &s;uch in Inland Places, a great way from the Sea; as at <HI>Aphrodicaea</HI> in <HI>Caria,</HI> &amp;c. All that he thinks worth writing of it, was, That it made a noi&s;e, like the Waves of the Sea, when the South-Wind bloweth. We could not have permi&s;&s;ion to go into the Temple, to &s;ee it; becau&s;e the <HI>Turk</HI> that lives in it, hath made it his <HI>Seraglio</HI> for his Women; and was then abroad. But we were a&s;&s;ured, That the Well is now almo&s;t dry. On the South-&s;ide of the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> we &s;aw &s;ome antient Ruins; where are to be &s;een
<PB N="365" REF="150">&s;ome Statues of Women, in the Walls; which my Comrade thinks, may be the <HI>Graces,</HI> which <HI>Socrates</HI> hath made there: Becau&s;e Authors expre&s;|ly &s;ay, That although the <HI>Graces</HI> u&s;ed ordinarily to be repre&s;ented na|ked; yet <HI>Socrates</HI> made his to appear cloathed, as the&s;e here are. 'Tis like al&s;o, here was the Temple of <HI>Minerva Poliades;</HI> that is, Protectrice of the City; and the Temple of the Nymph <HI>Pandro&s;a;</HI> but no Remains of them are now to be &s;een.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were come out of the Ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THEATER of BACCHUS.</NOTE> we turned on our left hand, and came to the <HI>Theater</HI> of <HI>Bacchus;</HI> ju&s;t as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> de&s;cribes it, under the Southern-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle; upon the ri&s;e of who&s;e Rock were the Seats of the Spectators; which comprehend &s;ome Degrees a|bove a Semicircle: who&s;e Diameter, as Con&s;ul <HI>Giraud</HI> mea&s;ured it by the <HI>French</HI> Foot, is Two hundred, forty three foot; and as M^r <HI>Francis Vernon,</HI> in his Letter to the Royal Society, by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Foot, is Two hundred &s;ixty three. I was prevented from taking all its Dimen&s;ions exactly, becau&s;e I heard the <HI>Turks</HI> from the Ca&s;tle, were very angry with the Con&s;ul for doing it; &s;o that I only paced it, and found the whole Body of the Scene, Ninety one Paces; of which the Seats take up Twenty five, on each &s;ide of the Scene; and the Scene it &s;elf Forty five. The Scene is oblong, jetting out &s;ix Paces more forward in the Front, than the Seats of the Spectators.</P>

<P>The antient Seats are ruined; but &s;ome di&s;tinct Di&s;tances appear, &s;hew|ing where they have been. The Semicircular Area below the Seats, and the Scene, are filled a good height with their own Ruins; and that which appears be&s;t pre&s;erved again&s;t the Injuries of time, is the Front, looking towards the Sea; where three Ranges of Arches remain, one above a|nother. The uppermo&s;t were, no doubt, for Windows, and to let in the
<PB N="366" REF="151">Air; but the lowermo&s;t could not rea&s;onably be thought &s;o, becau&s;e they were probably even with the Ground, being now part covered under Ground without, and perfectly buried within. Be&s;ides, the middle Arch is &s;o much larger, and higher than the re&s;t, that it could have been no other, but the chief Entrance into the Area, and had the Scene or Stage above it. The two le&s;&s;er Arches on each &s;ide, might be for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, lead al&s;o into the Area. The&s;e five Arches take up the breadth of the Scene only. On each &s;ide of which, pa&s;&s;ing the Corners of the Scene, towards the ends of the Seats, are two more Arches; which, whether they were for Caves, under the degrees or ways up to them, is now too late to determine. The next Range of Arches, where the Windows began, are le&s;s in bigne&s;s; but are more in number, than the others. Over the great Arch, in the middle of the Scene, is no Window, but a little Room; &s;o big as the thickne&s;s of the Wall, and breadth of the Door will give it leave: which my Comrade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> forgot to mention. What was the u&s;e of it, I know not, unle&s;s for a Retreat to the Actors. On each hand of this, were three Arches; at each end of the Degrees, three more; in all twelve. The third Rank, I judge, contained as many; but are now mo&s;t of them broken down. Above the Sears of the Spectators, is the Grotto, which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;peaks of here, in the Rock, under the <HI>Acropolis;</HI> in which was a <HI>Tripous,</HI> where|on was engraven <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Diana,</HI> &s;laying the Children of <HI>Niobe.</HI> This Theater was antiently adorned with the Statues of their <HI>Tragedians</HI> and <HI>Comedians;</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Menander</HI> only was illu&s;trious: but of the <HI>Trage|dians,</HI> many; among which <HI>Euripides, Sophoeles,</HI> and <HI>Ae&s;chylus:</HI> and the whole Fabrick was of white Marble.</P>

<P>Above the Seats of the Spectators, we found four In&s;criptions upon little Pillars: among the re&s;t, one of <HI>Artemidorus,</HI> Son of <HI>Apollophanes</HI> of <HI>A|chaia;</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="151">who, perhaps, might have place among&s;t the Dramatick Poets. For <HI>Apollophanes</HI> was a <HI>Comedian</HI> of <HI>Athens;</HI> who&s;e Plays are numbred by <HI>Suidas.</HI> One <HI>Artemidorus</HI> is al&s;o mentioned by him, whom he calls <GAP DESC="foreign">; which was, probably, becau&s;e he put out &s;ome Comedies either in the Name of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> or in imitation of him. The &s;econd was of one <HI>Philaetus,</HI> Freeman, and Receiver of the Tax of the <HI>Twentieth;</HI> who made that Monument to his Friend <HI>Quintus Calpurnius Eutyches.</HI> The third was a Pillar of one <HI>Nicon</HI> of the <HI>Halians,</HI> a little Town of <HI>Attica,</HI> by the Sea-&s;ide: whether it was of that <HI>Nicon,</HI> who was the great Victor in the <HI>Athletick</HI> Games, of whom <HI>Suidas</HI> &s;peaks, I leave others to determine. The fourth was of one <HI>Cleo,</HI> or <HI>Cleon,</HI> the Son of <HI>Andronicus,</HI> of <HI>Pheneos,</HI> a Town in <HI>Arcadia.</HI> There was one of this Name, famous in <HI>Thucydides;</HI> who was Ma&s;ter of &s;uch a Tongue, that he could per&s;wade the People to do what&s;oever he had a mind to. He was their <HI>General</HI> al&s;o in &s;everal Expeditions; but, at la&s;t, &s;lain in <HI>Thrace,</HI> flying with his Ar|my from before <HI>Amphipolis,</HI> which he had be&s;ieged; wherein <HI>Bra&s;&s;idas</HI> was Captain of the <HI>Lacedemonians;</HI> who, though he gain'd a great Victory, and knew it before his Death, yet he &s;urviv'd not long after it, but died of tho&s;e Wounds he received from the <HI>Athenians,</HI> in his pur&s;uing of them.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Foundations of Arches, run along in the &s;ame Line with the Front of the Theater, Ea&s;twards; which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Remains of the <HI>Portico</HI> of <HI>Eumenes,</HI> where the <HI>Tragedians</HI> gat their Plays by heart; and was the chief Walking-place in the whole Town: whither they went not only to take the Air, but to conver&s;e with Men of Learning, to hear the News, and to divert them&s;elves in the company of <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> and ingenious Men. From whence it was, that the Fol|lowers of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> were called <HI>Peripateticks,</HI> from their Di|&s;puting as they walked: So al&s;o the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> from their Meeting in the&s;e Cloi&s;ters, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> called <GAP DESC="foreign">, to hear their Ma&s;ter <HI>Zeno,</HI> took their Name. This Foundation runs along a good way, and is backed with a Wall; above which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>Portico</HI> was built; for the other is part of the &s;econd Wall, about the <HI>Acropolis</HI> I before mentioned. To enter which you mu&s;t go from the Theater, almo&s;t to the Ea&s;t-end of the Southern-Wall of the Ca&s;tle; and then turn into it by an old Gate. All between this Wall, and the Ca&s;tle, is now di&s;-in|habited, and turned into Corn-fields.</P>

<P>The&s;e In&s;criptions &s;hew, That it either belonged to &s;ome <HI>Gymna&s;ium,</HI> or was a Monument erected in honour of tho&s;e, who had been <HI>Victors</HI> in tho&s;e Exerci&s;es; and not the <HI>Grotto,</HI> where <HI>Apollo</HI> courted <HI>Creu&s;a,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Erictheus,</HI> and was afterward dedicated to <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Pan;</HI> as hath been, until now, generally thought.

The two other In&s;criptions are mentioned by <HI>Fulvius &V;r&s;inus;</HI> but he &s;aith not, where they are. <HI>Pitharotus</HI> was <HI>Archon</HI> the &s;econd Year of the Hundred twenty &s;eventh <HI>Olympiad;</HI> that is to &s;ay, Two hun|dred, &s;eventy one Years before the Nativity of our Lord, and Four hundred, eighty three Years after the Foundation of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The Beginning of the Second In&s;cription is like the Fir&s;t: But after telleth, That <HI>Andron,</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Pandion,</HI> was <HI>Victor;</HI> That <HI>Ni|cocles,</HI> of <HI>Ambracia,</HI> was Mu&s;ician; and That <HI>Ly&s;ippus,</HI> of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> made, or exhibited the Play. <HI>Suidas</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> mention one <HI>Ly&s;ippus,</HI> as the Author of many <HI>Tragedies.</HI></P>
<P>The Third &s;hews, That <HI>Thra&s;yllus,</HI> Son of <HI>Thra&s;yllus</HI> of <HI>Dicelia,</HI> was the Founder of this Building; and being the Contriver of the Game, or Play, and him&s;elf <HI>Victor,</HI> erected it for the Men of the Tribe of <HI>Hippo|thoon; Ericus</HI> of <HI>Chalcis</HI> being Mu&s;ician, <HI>Naeachmus</HI> Archon, and <HI>Cara|domus Sotius</HI> taught the Game. <HI>Naeachmus</HI> was Archon of <HI>Athens</HI> the fir&s;t Year of the Hundred and fifteen <HI>Olympiad;</HI> that is, Four hundred, thirty four Years after the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> and Three hundred, twen|ty Years before the Coming of Chri&s;t:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Helvicus Chro|nol.</NOTE> So this In&s;cription is Forty nine Years older than the two fir&s;t; and this a Place of very great Antiquity, the In&s;criptions being older, than tho&s;e of <HI>Duillius</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> ob&s;erves. <HI>Fulvius &V;r&s;inus</HI> hath ob&s;erved, That the Terms u&s;ed in the&s;e In&s;criptions, an&s;wer to tho&s;e that are at the beginning of <HI>Terence.</HI> For, as here we have

For in the Third, the Place was built to the Men, appertaining to the Tribe of <HI>Hippothoon,</HI> the Tribe of the Foun|der of the Edifice; who was al&s;o the In&s;titutor of the Game, and Victor in it. In the Fir&s;t and Second nine and forty Years after that, the Lads of the &s;ame Tribe of <HI>Hippothoon</HI> had the Victory, the People being at the Co&s;t of the Play, and that under the &s;ame Archon al&s;o, tho&s;e of the Tribe of <HI>Pandion</HI> won the Prize. Here is &s;till you &s;ee &s;ome Victory, &s;ome Prize won or lo&s;t. So that this could not properly belong to <HI>Co|medies,</HI> or <HI>Tragedies,</HI> wherein no Prize is &s;et for them that do be&s;t, no Victory of any &s;ides, nor any one really Victor: But, in Athletick Games, u&s;ually the Combatants are &s;ingle Per&s;ons, or oppo&s;ite Parties; who try for the Ma&s;tery hand to hand, one with another. And that this was really &s;o, the word <HI>Agonothetes</HI> puts it out of que&s;tion. For tho&s;e Games had &s;uch an Officer belonging to them, and always attending upon them, to regulate them, and &s;ee the Laws of each particular Game duly ob|&s;erv'd, that none might &s;trive for Victory, by any undue or di&s;allowed Means. But whoever heard of &s;uch an Officer belonging to the Scene? Therefore my Opinion is, That this was a <HI>Gymna&s;ium,</HI> or part of one at lea&s;t, built for the U&s;e of the Tribe of <HI>Hippothoon,</HI> by the Munificence of <HI>Thra&s;yllus;</HI> but that afterwards other Tribes were admitted al&s;o, to con|tend for the Prize; as it is apparent, that tho&s;e of the Tribe of <HI>Pandi|on</HI> were, who had the Victory forty Years after. This <HI>Grotto</HI> is a pret|ty large Place within, and hath two Cells, one above another. Above this <HI>Grotto</HI> are two Pillars &s;tanding upright, of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order: but the Leaves are different from the Thi&s;tle-Leaves of that Order, be|ing long and &s;mooth at the Edges.</P>
<P>After, we turned about the Ea&s;tern end of the Ca&s;tle, and came to another <HI>Grotto,</HI> made by Nature in the Rock, without either Ornament or Art, u&s;ed to beautifie it: which is more likely to be the <HI>Grotto</HI> of <HI>Pan</HI> and <HI>Apollo,</HI> according to the forementioned Authors, but agrees not with <HI>Pau&s;anias.</HI> It is &s;een from the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI>'s Hou&s;e, almo&s;t in the middle of the Town, which lieth North off the Cittadel.</P>
<P>From this end of the Ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HADRIAN'S PILLARS.</NOTE> South-Ea&s;twards, are tho&s;e tall and beau|tiful Pillars, called <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s <HI>Pillars,</HI> and are commonly reputed to be the Remains of his Palace; and were very probably the greate&s;t Orna|ment of it, if not of the City too, when the whole Structure thereof was entire. But my Comrade and I are not of their Opinion, that be|lieve his Palace was built on the top of them: for that, doubtle&s;s, would prove too really a <HI>Ca&s;tle built in the Air:</HI> They being about Fifty two foot high, comprehending the Chapters and <HI>Ba&s;is.</HI> They are of the
<PB N="371" REF="153"><HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, chanelled; and of admirable white Marble. They are al&s;o &s;eventeen foot, nine inches about. Their <HI>Ba&s;es</HI> are of two great Stones apiece, whereof the fir&s;t is three foot, nine inches deep; and &s;quare eight foot, nine Inches and a half; the next eight foot, four inches and a half, &s;quare, and of equal depth with the undermo&s;t. But &s;even|teen of the&s;e Pillars remain upright; yet by the Plane we found, that there mu&s;t have been &s;ix Rows of them, and twenty in each Row: which therefore mu&s;t be that <HI>Hundred and Twenty, Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;peaketh of, as built by the Emperour <HI>Hadrian,</HI> of <HI>Phrygian</HI> Marble, being whi|ter than that of <HI>Pentelycus.</HI> And certainly this was a Work alone, that may &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifie the Liberality of <HI>Hadcian,</HI> and the great care he took to adorn this City. For this mu&s;t needs have been a wonderful <HI>Portico,</HI> both for Beauty, U&s;e, and Grandeur. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;ays, That it was inclo&s;ed with a Cloy&s;ter, in which were built Rooms of the &s;ame Stone, only the Roofs of Alaba&s;ter, gilded with Gold, and the whole excellently adorned with Statues and Pictures: That here was the fa|mous Library that Emperour collected, and a <HI>Gymna&s;ium,</HI> bearing his Name, where undoubtedly were celebrated the Games <HI>Adrianalia,</HI> in&s;ti|tuted by him, and mentioned in &s;everal Monuments there, and particu|larly on this at the Church of <HI>Georgopico.</HI> Which &s;ignifies, That <HI>Mar|cus Tullius</HI> of <HI>Apamea,</HI> in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> Citizen of <HI>Athens, Corinth, Smyrna;</HI> the only Man among the Athleticks, that ever overcame in all the fol|lowing Games, viz. <HI>Panellenia, Olympia, I&s;thmia, Adriania, Romia</HI> with a matter of one and twenty more, marked upon Urns and Shields; whereof mo&s;t of the Names are defaced. This Man, &s;aith the In&s;cripti|on, having born away all the Games, Prizes, and other the mo&s;t difficult Exerci&s;es, died in the two and thirtieth Year, and third Month of his Age, having this Monument erected to him by his Brother, <HI>Mar|cus Tullius Eutyches:</HI> But <HI>Klitoris</HI> gave the Place for it to be erected on.</P>

<P>About this <HI>Gymna&s;ium</HI> were an hundred Pillars of <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Marble. It is hard to determine, whether the Temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympius</HI> was here or no; and whether the Plane of this <HI>Portico,</HI> of an hundred and twenty Pillars, was any more than part of it. For the whole place en|vironing them, is very large; as appears by the Foundations of the Walls, which are of good Stone, well hewn, and upheld with &s;trong Buttre&s;&s;es;
<PB N="373" REF="154">the Plane of the&s;e Pillars being only an Oblong in the middle of it. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> al&s;o mentions that Temple, both before, and ju&s;t after this, promi&s;cuou&s;ly. But, I &s;uppo&s;e, it was in another place; of which more hereafter. I remember, that I took the Dimen&s;ions of the Plane of this Place; but find them not among my Papers. Under tho&s;e Pillars that yet &s;tand, with their Architraves on them, is a little Church, built out of pieces of Pillars, and other Rubbi&s;h, very badly, without any Chalk or Lime, but rudely laid together; which I &s;hould not have mentioned, had not Mon&s;ieur <HI>Guiliter</HI> called it the Temple of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and <HI>Juno Pan|hellenii;</HI> than which, &s;carce any thing can be more ridiculous. The truth of it is, &s;uch a Temple might be &s;ome where in this Quarter: For <HI>Adrian</HI> built a great way about here, along the River <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> and North-Ea&s;tward towards Mount S^t <HI>George,</HI> or <HI>Anche&s;mus,</HI> and called it his Town; as the In&s;cription on the Gate of white Marble, between the&s;e Parts, and the re&s;t of the City, te&s;tifie. For towards the City, it is written in <HI>Greek, This is</HI> Athens; <HI>in times pa&s;t the City of</HI> The&s;eus: and on that &s;ide looking toward the Pillars; <HI>But this is</HI> Adrian's, <HI>and not the City of</HI> The&s;eus.</P>

But being gat up, is the mo&s;t eminent and per&s;picuous Place of the whole Plain of <HI>Athens;</HI> and from whence I &s;ecurely ob&s;erved every be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Object <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the South We&s;t-&s;ide of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> excepted.

Here either a <HI>Democritus</HI> might &s;it, and laugh at the Pomps and Vanities of the World, who&s;e Glories &s;o &s;oon vani&s;h; or an <HI>Hera|clitus</HI> weep over the manifold Misfortunes of it, telling &s;ad Stories of the various Changes and Events of Fate. This would have been a Place to in&s;pire a Poet, as the brave Actions, performed within
<PB N="375" REF="155">his view, have already exerci&s;ed the Pens of great Hi&s;torians. Here, like <HI>Virgil,</HI> he might have &s;ate, and interwoven beautiful De&s;criptions of the Rivers, Mountains, Woods of Olives, and Groves of Lemons and Oranges, with the celebrated Harbours on the Shore, and I&s;lands, &s;ometimes King|doms, in the <HI>Saronick</HI> Sea, all lying &s;pread before him, as on a Map: Which I was contented to do only in Contemplation, and with a Sea|compa&s;s, to mark out the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Places on Paper.</P>
<P><HI>Adrian</HI>'s Pillars are &s;een from this high Rock, South-We&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The STADIUM.</NOTE> and Ea&s;t of them; but South, South-We&s;t, We&s;t, from hence, over the River <HI>I|li&s;&s;us,</HI> we &s;aw the <HI>Stadium,</HI> looking like a &s;mall Hill. The way to it from the Town, is by an antient Bridge of three Arches, built cro&s;s the <HI>Ili&s;|&s;us,</HI> of large hewn Stone, laid firm together without Mortar; and is a|bout forty foot long. On this Bridge was formerly a great Mona&s;tery, but now for&s;aken, &s;ince the <HI>Turks</HI> took <HI>Athens.</HI> The <HI>Stadium</HI> was the Place, where antiently they ran Races, fought wild Bea&s;ts, and celebra|ted tho&s;e other publick Games of <HI>All-Attica,</HI> called <HI>Panathenia.</HI> It was probably here, that they cha&s;ed the <HI>Thou&s;and Wild Bea&s;ts,</HI> which <HI>Adri|an</HI> every Year gave to the People for their Diverti&s;ement. Its Figure and bigne&s;s continue, although the Degrees be all taken away. It is a long Place, with two parallel &s;ides, clo&s;ed up circularly at the Ea&s;t end, and open towards the other end; and is about One hundred, twenty five Geometrical Paces long, and Twenty &s;ix, or Twenty &s;even broad; which gave it the Name of a <HI>Stadium,</HI> that length being the ordinary mea&s;ure among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> eight of which made a <HI>Roman</HI> Mile. M^t <HI>Vernon</HI> mea&s;uring it exactly, found it to be Six hundred, and thirty <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> feet long: and a ju&s;t <HI>Stadium</HI> is Six hundred, Twenty five foot of <HI>Athenian</HI> Mea&s;ure; which, it &s;eems, was but very little bigger than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but le&s;&s;er than the <HI>French</HI> foot. When <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> comes to &s;peak of this Place, he tells his Readers, That they would hardly believe what he was about to tell them, it being a Wonder to all tho&s;e that did &s;ee it in antient times; and of that bigne&s;s, that one would judge it a Moun|tain of white Marble, upon the Banks of the River <HI>Ili&s;&s;us.</HI> It was <HI>He|rodes Atticus,</HI> one of the riche&s;t Citizens <HI>Athens</HI> ever had, that built it; to do which, he con&s;umed much of the Marble of Mount <HI>Pentelicus:</HI> which now being either all carried away, or buried in the Ruins of the Place, it looks now only like a great and high Bulwark, ca&s;t up in that Form. At the End towards <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> there appears yet &s;ome Stone|work; the re&s;t is now but a <HI>Stadium</HI> of Earth above Ground. This was the &s;ame <HI>Herodes Atticus,</HI> that built al&s;o the <HI>Stadium</HI> at <HI>Delphos,</HI> and ma|ny other Magnificent Structures, in other Parts of <HI>Greece:</HI> But was not that <HI>Herodes,</HI> that Reigned in <HI>Judaea,</HI> at the time when Chri&s;t was born; as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon</HI> hath &s;hewed by a &s;hort, but ju&s;t Account, out of An|tiquities, and Authors, that mention him: which, becau&s;e it is a Cu|rio&s;ity, that every one doth not yet know, I will not omit.</P>
<Q><P>About the Beginning of this Century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERODES ATTICUS.</NOTE> two In&s;criptions were found at <HI>Rome;</HI> one of this <HI>Herod,</HI> and the other of his Wife <HI>Regella. Ca|&s;aubon</HI> gives the Explication of the fir&s;t: but as learned as he was, he mi&s;took notably, in taking this <HI>Herod</HI> for him that Reigned in <HI>Judaea. Arcudius,</HI> with much better &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hews, That the In&s;cription con|cern'd that <HI>Illu&s;trious Herod,</HI> the <HI>Athenian.</HI> But becau&s;e every one
<PB N="376" REF="156">knows not &s;o much, I will give you the&s;e following Particularities of it.</P>
<P><HI>Heredes Atticus</HI> was a Citizen of <HI>Athens,</HI> born at <HI>Marathon,</HI> a little Town pertaining to the Tribe of <HI>Ajax.</HI> He flouri&s;hed about the time of the Emperours, <HI>Trajan, Adrian, Antoninus,</HI> and <HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> His Grand-Father <HI>Hipparchus,</HI> or, as <HI>Suidas</HI> has it, <HI>Plutarchus,</HI> was well to pa&s;s in the World: But having been accu&s;ed of &s;ome Tyrannical Practices u&s;ed towards the People, the Emperour confi&s;cated all his E&s;tate; &s;o that his Son <HI>Atticus,</HI> Father of this <HI>Herod,</HI> lived afterward, at <HI>Athens,</HI> in a mean condition: Until, having found a great hidden Trea&s;ure in his own Hou&s;e, near the Theater, he became on a &s;udden very Rich. He was not more fortunate in finding it, than prudent in getting it confirmed on him&s;elf: For well knowing, &s;hould it come to be di&s;covered, he &s;hould be obliged to give an Account of it to the Emperour; becau&s;e by the Law, <HI>All found Trea&s;ure belongs to tho&s;e So|vertign Princes, in who&s;e Dominions it is found;</HI> and then he mu&s;t look to become again as poor as ever. He therefore forth-with wrote a Letter in this manner, to the Emperour: <HI>My Liege, I have found a Trea&s;ure in my Hou&s;e; what do you command, that I &s;hall do with it?</HI> The Emperour an|&s;wered him, <HI>That he &s;hould make u&s;e of what he had found.</HI> But <HI>Atticus</HI> yet fearing, he might be in danger of &s;ome trouble, when the great|ne&s;s of the Trea&s;ure &s;hould come to be known, wrote the &s;econd time to the Emperour; profe&s;&s;ing ingeniou&s;ly, That the Trea&s;ure he had written to him about, was too great a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for him, and exceeded the Capacity of a private Man. But the Emperour an&s;wers him again with the &s;ame Genero&s;ity: <HI>Abu&s;e al&s;o, if thou wilt, the Riches thou ha&s;t &s;o ancidentally come by; for they are thine.</HI> By this means <HI>Atticus</HI> became again extream rich and powerful; having married a Wi&s;e al&s;o, that was very rich. Whence it came to pa&s;s, that his Son and Heir, <HI>He|rodel,</HI> far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his Father, both in Wealth and Magnificence; and became the Founder of many &s;tately Edifiers, in &s;undry Parts of <HI>Greece:</HI> and dying, left by his la&s;t Will, ten Crowns to every Citizen of <HI>A|theus.</HI> Neither did he partake le&s;s of Vertue, and Merit, than he did of Fortunes being very learned, and &s;o eloquent, that he was called <HI>The Tongue of Athens;</HI> having been the Di&s;ciple of the famous <HI>Pha|noriuns. Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Lucius Veras,</HI> Emperours of his time, made it their Glory, that they had been his Auditors. His entire Name was <HI>Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes;</HI> as I prove by an In&s;cri|ption, that is at <HI>Athens,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Signior <HI>Nicolo Limbonai.</HI></P></Q>

<P><Q>He married a mo&s;t vertuous <HI>Roman</HI> Matron, named <HI>Regilla;</HI> in who&s;e Memory he built a cover'd Theater for Mu&s;ick, at <HI>Athens;</HI> And after her Death, put his Hou&s;e in Mourning with black Marble of <HI>Lesbos,</HI> to make it an Eternal Monument of his Grief for the lo&s;s of her. He built al&s;o a Temple at his Country-hou&s;e, called <HI>Triopnaea,</HI> near <HI>Rome;</HI> where tho&s;e In&s;criptions were found, of which I have &s;poken, and are now to be &s;een in the <HI>Vigne Borghe&s;e.</HI> He died at three&s;core Years of Age, and left two Sons, of whom Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent. He gave order to his Freemen, to bury him at <HI>Marathon,</HI> the Place of his Birth. But the <HI>Athenians</HI> would have his Body with them; and made him be brought thither by &s;ome of their young Men: burying him in the <HI>Sta|dium Panathenaeum,</HI> which he had built; accompanying his Body to the Grave weeping, like Children for the lo&s;s of their Parents.</Q></P>
<P>Advancing a little higher upon the River <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> on the left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The TEMPLE OF THE <HI>ILISSI|AN</HI> MUSES</NOTE> we &s;aw the Foundations of a little round Temple, di&s;covered not long &s;ince by an Inundation, which did a great deal of Mi&s;chief to the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
<PB N="378" REF="157">throwing down their Country-Hou&s;es, Trees, and Walls, and quite de|&s;troying all their Gardens, in its Pa&s;&s;age. This, probably, was the Tem|ple of the <HI>Mu&s;ae Ili&s;&s;iades,</HI> being &s;eated upon the Banks of this River, according as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> informs us. From whence <HI>Boreas,</HI> in a Whirl|wind, took away the Nymph <HI>Orithya,</HI> whom he found &s;porting upon the&s;e Banks. A little further, on the right hand of this River, is ano|ther &s;mall Temple, &s;ince turned into a Church, and con&s;ecrated to the Memory of S^t <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Crucifixion,</HI> called <HI>Stauro&s;is Petrou,</HI> or, as others &s;peak it, <HI>Stauromenou Petrou:</HI> The Floor of which is paved with anti|ent Mo&s;aick Work, and the whole Fabrick of white Marble. This was undoubtedly the antient Temple of <HI>Diana Agrotera,</HI> or <HI>Diana</HI> the <HI>Hun|tre&s;s;</HI> whence the Campagne about it, beyond the <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> was called <HI>A|gra,</HI> from <HI>Diana</HI>'s fir&s;t Hunting there, when &s;he came from <HI>Delos.</HI> And tho&s;e Parts, towards the Mountain <HI>Hymett&ugrave;s,</HI> do yet abound with Hares and Partridges. Hard by this, is a little Stream, falling into the <HI>Ili&s;&s;us;</HI> which hath its Ri&s;e at a Mona&s;tery, &s;ituated on the &s;ide of the Mountain <HI>Hymettus,</HI> called by the <HI>Greeks, Cyriani,</HI> and by the <HI>Turks, Cosba&s;hi,</HI> or <HI>Sheep's Head;</HI> the Fountain of <HI>Ili&s;&s;us</HI> being more Ea&s;tward. The grea|te&s;t part of the Water of both of them, is collected into Pipes under ground, and brought to <HI>Athens.</HI> My Opinion is, That this is rather the <HI>Eridanus,</HI> than the other, which waters the other &s;ide of the Plain of <HI>Athens:</HI> not only becau&s;e <HI>Strabo</HI> plainly calleth the other <HI>Cephi&s;us;</HI> but al&s;o, becau&s;e &s;peaking of <HI>Eridanus</HI> out of <HI>Callimachus:</HI> <Q>There are, as they &s;ay indeed, &s;aith he, tho&s;e Springs of pure, and potable Water, without tho&s;e Gates they call <HI>Diochorus,</HI> near that &s;ide of the City, where the <HI>Lycaeum</HI> is: Not far from which, &s;ome Body built a Foun|tain, well furni&s;hed with good Water; which, if it now remains not, though antiently full of Water, clear, and fit to drink, as being chang'd and corrupted in &s;ucceeding times, what wonder is it?</Q> And even <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> him&s;elf, if rightly under&s;tood, doth not call that other River, <HI>Eridanus.</HI> That which he &s;aith, is, <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>and another River of the &s;ame Name with the</HI> Celtick Eridanus, <HI>which falls into the</HI> Ili&s;&s;us, <HI>are the Rivers that glide to the</HI> Athenians: And not, as the Tran&s;lator of <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Amnes in</HI> Attic&acirc; <HI>nobiles,</HI> Cephi&s;us, <HI>&amp; in eum cadens</HI> Eridanus. Where he hath mi&s;taken <HI>Attica</HI> for <HI>Athens,</HI> and given tho&s;e Streams the Title of <HI>Eminence,</HI> without <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his order. That <HI>Eridanus</HI> falls into the River <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> is very properly &s;aid of this Stream of <HI>Cyrie Jani;</HI> but not of the other. For the other is a much larger Stream, &s;till well &s;upplied with Water, lies much lower than <HI>Ili&s;&s;us</HI> or this, and runs in a &s;treight Line, within its own Chanel, although &s;ometimes divided by Art: And <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> being little more than a Torrent, may properly be &s;aid to fall into that on the We&s;t &s;ide of the City; but not that into <HI>Ili&s;&s;us.</HI> This only of <HI>Cyriani</HI> can be properly &s;aid to fall into the <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> becau&s;e it ri&s;eth much higher than it. Neither can that other River be &s;o properly &s;aid to belong to <HI>Athens,</HI> as the&s;e; it running two or three Miles from it out of Town: But the&s;e mo&s;t properly, becau&s;e they ran by the Walls; and from their Springs it is evident, the Town hath &s;till been &s;erved with Water, as the Remains of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s <HI>Aqueduct</HI> and Ci&s;tern of Waters under <HI>Anche&s;mus,</HI>
<PB N="379" REF="157">and the New <HI>Aqueducts</HI> under ground, to the Town, do manife&s;t. If any have better Rea&s;ons for the contrary Opinion, I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee them, and &s;ubmit to them; but till then, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e this of <HI>Cy|riani</HI> to be <HI>Eridanus;</HI> and &s;o call it in my Map.</P>
<P>Going down the Stream, along the <HI>Ili&s;&s;us,</HI> beyond the <HI>Stadium,</HI> and Pillars of <HI>Hadrian,</HI> is another little Marble Building, now dedicated to <HI>Panagia,</HI> or the mo&s;t Holy Virgin; and, as &s;ome will have it, was antiently the Temple of <HI>Ceres:</HI> and, perhaps, they may have their Rea|&s;ons too, of which I am yet ignorant. But <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;eemeth to joyn that to another Temple, at the other &s;ide of the Town, coming in by the place <HI>Ceramica.</HI> But this Author is not altogether &s;o regular in his De&s;criptions of Places, as it might be wi&s;hed. This Church hath been painted formerly, according to the <HI>Greek</HI> manner, that is, with no great Art: but is now quite defaced.</P>
<P>De&s;cending yet a little further by the River, &s;ome Rocks &s;eem to &s;top its Cour&s;e; whereby the Water begins to appear again, and &s;ettle in a kind of Pool upon the Rocks. In great Rains, I judge, the Water in the Pools overflows; but while we were there, it was dry Weather, and did not: but finding &s;ome Subterraneous Pa&s;&s;age by, or under the Rocks; after a little way, it breaks out again, and makes a Fountain: Which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Callirrhoe</HI> of former times, or rather the &s;ame, which, in <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> is called <HI>Halirrhothium;</HI> becau&s;e the Inha|bitants of this Place give unto this Fountain a Name, in &s;ound not much unlike unto it, calling it <HI>Calliro.</HI> But this, I confe&s;s, I know not how to ju&s;tifie by the Authority of <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> although he &s;peaks of that Fountain three &s;everal times. The <HI>Turks,</HI> after their Mode, have ac|commodated two Fountains to this Spring. I take <HI>Calliro,</HI> or <HI>Caliro,</HI> to be only an Abreviation of <HI>Galo Nero,</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>Good Water:</HI> Suppo|&s;ing <HI>Callirrhoe</HI> to be at another Place; of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak, before I conclude this Account of <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>Hard by this are &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gardens; and a Summer-hou&s;e belong|ing to one of them, inhabiting in the Town. Below them, on the fur|ther &s;ide of the River, is another little Temple on the top of a &s;mall Rock. But to which of the Gods it was dedicated in times pa&s;t, I &s;ee nothing to inform me: At pre&s;ent it is con&s;ecrated to the Holy Virgin, and they call it <HI>Hagia Maria;</HI> that is, <HI>Saint Maries.</HI> Near to this pa&s;|&s;eth the way, that leads to <HI>Capo Colonni.</HI></P>

That Marble tells us al&s;o, That his Sepulchre was at the Port <HI>Phalera:</HI> But <HI>Paufanias</HI> &s;ays, He was buried here when he died of great age. The Inhabitants call this Hill <HI>To Seggio;</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Francks, The Hill of the Arch of Tra|jan,</HI> from a Monument of Antiquity upon it: where indeed &s;omething is to be read touching that Emperour, but not any thing to ju&s;tifie that naming of the place. It is a Structure of admirable white Marble, and no le&s;s curious Work, built a proportionable height &s;omething circular.

<P>De&s;cending hence Northward, you pa&s;s over a little Valley and the Turki&s;h Burying-place, then mounting again, and leaving the Theatre of <HI>Bacchus</HI> at the We&s;t end of the Ca&s;tle on the right hand, you get to the top of a little Steep, though Hill, or rather a ridge of little Hills de&s;cend|ing from the Rock of the Ca&s;tle. Being on the top, I remembred one thing, which my Companion, I find, takes not any notice of. It is a Fountain accommodated according to the Turki&s;h mode, with one or two Cocks of water. I have con&s;idered the &s;ituation of the place, and do believe it to be a Spring. For I remember when I went fir&s;t up to the Ca&s;tle, I would have ta&s;ted of it; but the Con&s;ul told me, the water was not very good to drink, but was u&s;ed by the <HI>Turks</HI> for other ordinary occa|&s;ions in the Ca&s;tle. I am &s;ure there are no Aqueducts to bring water &s;o high, the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eldom or never u&s;ing &s;o much as Leaden Pipes: or if they did, they would not be&s;tow &s;o much co&s;t to procure them&s;elves bad water, when they might have good &s;o much cheaper from Mount <HI>Hymettus.</HI> My opinion is, That this is <HI>that only Spring</HI> in the Town, that <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;peaks of, near the <HI>Odeum,</HI> &s;aying, There are many Wells in the Town, but only one Spring, which was called <HI>Henneacrene,</HI> becau&s;e the water i&s;&s;ued out by nine &s;everal Spouts, and was thus adorned by the Tyrant <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus.</HI> This in another place he mentions only by the name of <GAP DESC="foreign"> or Spring, coming down from the <HI>Acropolis</HI>-wards to the Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Pan,</HI> near the <HI>Propylaea</HI> or outward Gate of the Ca&s;tle. He mentions it a third time to this purpo&s;e: <Q>Going to the Ca&s;tle, &s;aith he, by the Theatre of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> is the Monument of <HI>Ca|lus,</HI> &amp;c. But the Temple of <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> is worthy to be &s;een for the many Statues and Pictures of him and his Children: in which is a Foun|tain, near which they &s;ay <HI>Halirrhothius,</HI> the Son of <HI>Neptune,</HI> lay with <HI>Alcippa,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Mars,</HI> and was therefore &s;lain by him: which Murder gave occa&s;ion for the fir&s;t Judgment to be given on Capital crimes.</Q> All the&s;e places evidently mark out the Fountain we &s;peak of. Again, after he had &s;poken of the Temple of <HI>Pan</HI> and <HI>Apollo,</HI> by way of connexion he adds <GAP DESC="foreign">, which his Tran&s;lator turns not well, <HI>Quae ver&ograve; &V;rbis regia Areopagus dicitur, &amp;c.</HI> For &s;o he &s;eems to break the thread of <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his De&s;cription. <HI>Sylburgius</HI> there|fore corrected him well, tran&s;lating it thus, <HI>Secundum hoc e&s;t ea &V;rbis pars, quae Areopagus dicitur:</HI> About, by, or near which place is that part of the City called <HI>The Areopagus;</HI> making this good conjecture perhaps, &s;aith he, from the nearne&s;s of it to the Hill of <HI>Mars.</HI> For from this Fountain, as I &s;aid, runs the ridge of a Hill from the Ca&s;tle North-We&s;twards; and might well enough be called <HI>Mars his Hill,</HI> on which that Region of the City was built, that bears <HI>Mars</HI> his Name, being
<PB N="384" REF="160">called <HI>Areio&s;pagus,</HI> or the <HI>Village of Mars. Pau&s;anias</HI> further adds, That in this place there were two Senates or Councils. The one was the Se|nate of the <HI>Five hundred,</HI> to whom belonged the Judgment of all com|mon and ordinary matters. The other was the Senate of the <HI>Areopa|gites</HI> only, where they judged of Capital crimes and ca&s;es extraordinary. Now if the <HI>Areopagus</HI> were upon this ridge of the Hill de&s;cending from the Ca&s;tle, <HI>He&s;ychius</HI> is not &s;o very blameable for putting it in that <HI>Acro|polis;</HI> for this Hill is part of the Rock the Ca&s;tle &s;tands upon. And <HI>Suidas</HI> &s;aith, That <HI>Pagus</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>Rock,</HI> Hill, or other eminent place. All which doth clearly in&s;inuate, that this &s;o celebrated place of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Ju|dicature was built upon this Hill; whence it was called <HI>Mars his Hill,</HI> becau&s;e upon it, <HI>Mars</HI> had &s;uffered Judgment in a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly for the Murder of <HI>Halirrhothius</HI> Son of <HI>Neptune.</HI> I &s;hall only add, That if the&s;e conjectures of mine, touching the <HI>Areopagus</HI> and Fountain there, be good, it will make a great alteration in the Names, which Travellers have hitherto given to &s;undry Antiquities in <HI>Athens.</HI> For it followeth, that the Temple of <HI>Ceres</HI> was near that place, and not on the Banks of <HI>Eili&s;&s;us;</HI> and that the Fountain <HI>Caliro</HI> there al&s;o, was neither <HI>Calirrhoe, Hallirrhothium,</HI> nor <HI>Henn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acrene:</HI> as indeed it could not be. For that Fountain on the River <HI>Ili&s;&s;us</HI> was never within the Walls of the City as tho&s;e were, no more than the River <HI>Eili&s;&s;us</HI> it &s;elf that ran by its Ea&s;tern Walls. This al&s;o helps &s;omething to vindicate the regularity of <HI>Pau&s;a|nias</HI> his De&s;cription of <HI>Athens;</HI> and without which he will be &s;aid to have done it with the greate&s;t confu&s;ion imaginable. I doubt al&s;o, Au|thors confound this Fountain <HI>Halirrhothium</HI> with <HI>Calirrhoe,</HI> the Fountain of <HI>Calydou</HI> in <HI>Aetotia:</HI> of which I have &s;poken &s;omething already in what I have &s;aid at <HI>Patras.</HI></P>
<P>From this Fountain, keeping along the ridge of the Hill, a little way North-We&s;twards, under a cragged Rock is a ruined Church, they &s;ay was formerly dedicated to Saint <HI>Dennys</HI> the Areopagite: and by it is the Palace of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Athens.</HI> They believe it was built on the Foundations of the Palace that mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Senator lived in, who was the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian and fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Athens.</HI> Of this Church there is nothing to be &s;een now but a heap of ruines; and a Well, where they &s;ay, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> hid him&s;elf for a little while, &s;eeing the people put in an uproar upon his Preaching in the <HI>Areopagus.</HI> This Tradition &s;eems to confirm my opinion, that the <HI>Areopagus</HI> &s;tood hereabouts.</P>

<P>Some from this Edict of <HI>Hadrian</HI> have thought this Place to be the <HI>Pry|taneum,</HI> where the Laws of <HI>Solon</HI> were kept. But they had not con|&s;ulted the In&s;cription, on the Architrave I before mentioned; which &s;hews it was built in the time of <HI>Herodes Atticus,</HI> and his Son <HI>Eucles.</HI> The <HI>Prytaneum,</HI> doubtle&s;s, was not far from hence, but up higher to|wards the Ca&s;tle. And it may po&s;&s;ibly be, that this Stone was once de|po&s;ited there: For though it be great, yet is not too big to have been brought thither. But where really the <HI>Prytaneum</HI> was, is not yet di&s;co|vered. I am apt to believe, it was between the &s;econd Wall, and the North-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle. For <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;till &s;peaks of de&s;cending from it, to the way called <HI>Tripoda,</HI> from its being adorn'd with Trivets, de|dicated to <HI>Apollo;</HI> and al&s;o of going from thence to the Temple of <HI>Se|rapis,</HI> towards the lower Parts of the City. And <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> who both en|larged the City, by the &s;econd Wall, and in&s;tituted the Senate of the <HI>Prytanes,</HI> without doubt appointed the Place of their A&s;&s;embly, within the Walls of his City.</P>
<P>But now I am got into <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his Road, I were be&s;t follow him &s;o far as I can. From the Temple of <HI>Serapis,</HI> he pa&s;&s;eth to the Temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympian,</HI> built by the Emperour <HI>Hadrianus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JUPITER OLYMPIUS</NOTE> Of this I have &s;poken a little already, when I de&s;cribed <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s Pillars. But I deter|mined not, where it was. From the Temple of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> therefore, cro&s;&s;ing the City Northwards, until you come into the large&s;t Street of the Town, which from the Gate <HI>Eleu&s;inia</HI> pa&s;&s;eth clear through the Ci|ty, although not in a very &s;treight Line, you will come to the Front of a Building over the Street, in an Entrance, fa&s;hioned like a Tem|ple. It hath, without doubt, been one of the mo&s;t Magnificent Build|ings in <HI>Athens,</HI> both for the bigne&s;s and beauty.</P>
<PB N="392" REF="164">
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>Temple of Olympian Jove</FIGDESC>
<HEAD>Templum Iovis Olympici Lib. V.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Entrance hath been in the middle of the Front, which regardeth the We&s;t, as may be proved from the Remains of it: For on the North-&s;ide it is joyned to a Wall of the &s;ame Order, adorned with <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, which are &s;et upon <HI>Ba&s;es,</HI> and a proportionable Frize above the Chapiters; which are eighteen in number: be&s;ides two on the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Ve&s;tibulum,</HI> or Entrance. To this is joyned a Wall in a right Angle; which, by pacing, we found to be, at lea&s;t, an Hundred twen|ty five Paces long; which is a <HI>Stadium;</HI> and about as much again, as it is from the Corner to the <HI>Ve&s;tibulum,</HI> or Porch, on the We&s;t &s;ide: But it is not adorned like it, nor ever hath been &s;o, that I could perceive: So that, I believe, the We&s;t-&s;ide was the principal Front, and that the Porch &s;tood in the middle of that &s;ide; and, by con&s;equence, was as long again, as what now remains, and equal to the North-&s;ide; and &s;o made a perfect Square of four <HI>Stadia;</HI> that is, Five hundred Paces about; without doubling the length, or making Outworks to it, as my Comrade hath imagined. And this is the Circumference <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> gives to the Temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympius.</HI> Be&s;ides, it is here in the lower Parts of the Town, from the <HI>Prytaneum,</HI> as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> clearly &s;eems to in&s;inuate, which lay on the North-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, as <HI>Thucydides</HI> placeth it. This Cir|cumference was not meerly the Temple, as my Comrade &s;eemeth to inti|mate, by doubling the length to make it, in proportion, like that of <HI>Minerva.</HI> For thus it would be a mon&s;trous Building, and could no way be accommodated to one &s;ide, which is a <HI>Stadium</HI> long. For &s;up|po&s;e the Front, which is the narrowe&s;t &s;ide of the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> to which he compares it, to be one <HI>Stadium</HI> broad, the Flanks to it mu&s;t be two <HI>Stadiums;</HI> which, with the Parallel to the Front, makes &s;ix <HI>Stadiums</HI> about. Suppo&s;e the Front-ends to be half a <HI>Stadium</HI> apiece,
<PB N="393" REF="164">then the two &s;ides would be two <HI>Stadiums,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of one &s;ide, being a <HI>Stadium;</HI> and the whole would be five <HI>Stadiums:</HI> and this Porch remaining, would be in the Corner. Be&s;ides, what po&s;&s;ibi|lity is there of making a Roof to a Building of Three&s;core and two Geo|metrical Paces, and one half; that is, Three hundred and twelve Feet, and one half broad? So that it is plain, this Building was exactly four &s;quare, and that each &s;ide contained a <HI>Stadium,</HI> which makes four <HI>Sta|dia;</HI> as the remaining &s;ide doth. Nor yet do I believe, that this Wall was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Temple it &s;elf; but only the <HI>Peribolus,</HI> or Court that &s;urrounded the Temple. And this is plain from <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> al&s;o, if we follow him&s;elf, and not his Interpreters, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. Before you enter into the <HI>To Hieron,</HI> or &s;acred Place of <HI>Jupiter Olympian, Hadrian</HI> founded the <GAP DESC="foreign">, with the Image very worthy to be &s;een. What difference there is between <HI>Hieron</HI> and <HI>Naon,</HI> let better Antiquaries judge. But &s;ure I am, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> here puts it to make a di&s;tinction between that which <HI>Hadrian</HI> built, of later times com|paratively &s;peaking, and that very antient <HI>Hieron,</HI> which they generally &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Deucalicon</HI> built pre&s;ently after the Deluge, and was &s;ituate &s;omewhere within, beyond the Building or Enlargement, which <HI>Hadria|nus</HI> added. What <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;ays is this: <Q>At the Entrance, before you enter the <HI>Hieron,</HI> or &s;acred Place of <HI>Jupiter Olympius,</HI> that was built of old, <HI>Hadrian,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, in his time built the <GAP DESC="foreign">, putting an Image of <HI>Jupiter</HI> therein, very worthy to be &s;een; not for bigne&s;s and greatne&s;s. For <HI>Colo&s;&s;ian</HI> Statues are only at <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI> The like al&s;o may be &s;een in other Statues. There are Sta|tues al&s;o, both of Ivory and Gold, excellently well made for their big|ne&s;s; e&s;pecially two Statues of the Emperour <HI>Hadrian</HI> him&s;elf; the one of <HI>Tha&s;&s;ian,</HI> the other of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Marble. But tho&s;e are Brazen Statues, that &s;tand by the Pillars; which the <HI>Athenians</HI> call the <HI>Colony-Cities;</HI> becau&s;e many of them were &s;ent from &s;uch Places, as were Co|lonies either of <HI>Rome,</HI> or <HI>Athens.</HI> The whole Court [<GAP DESC="foreign">] is four <HI>Stadia</HI> about, and full of &s;uch Statues; each City of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, or Alliance, having &s;ent one, and placed it there, to honour the Emperour. But that of the <HI>Athenians</HI> ju&s;tly excelleth the re&s;t; who in honour of this their great Friend and Benefactour <HI>Hadrian,</HI> e|rected that &s;tately <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> which is behind the Temple, a worthy &s;ight. More within are the things of old time; as the <HI>Jupiter</HI> of Bra&s;s being, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, of <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Dedication, the Temple of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Rhea,</HI> the Grove, or con&s;ecrated Place called <HI>Olympias:</HI> in which there is a hole of a Cubit's bigne&s;s, where the Waters of <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, they &s;ay, were received, and &s;uck't in. Into this hole they put yearly certain wheaten Cakes, mixed with Honey. <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> his Sta|tue is &s;aid to &s;tand again&s;t a Pillar here: But that <HI>Deucalion</HI> built the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t antient Temple, or <HI>Hieron,</HI> of <HI>Jupiter Olympius,</HI> all here agree; and that he liv'd and dyed at <HI>Athens,</HI> from his Tomb, which they &s;ay is there, not far from the pre&s;ent Temple.</Q></P>
<P>Much might be &s;aid out of all this; but I &s;hall content my &s;elf to give my Thoughts concerning it, on the Scheme I have de&s;igned of what re|mains, which in &s;hort is thus: Fir&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e the Porch, over the Street, is the <GAP DESC="foreign">, and We&s;t to it, the Front of the Temple, which was built
<PB N="394" REF="165">by the Emperour <HI>Hadrian;</HI> wherein was the Image of <HI>Jupiter:</HI> and that the four Walls about it, were the utmo&s;t Bounds of the <HI>Peribolus,</HI> or Court, and of the whole Temple. That where the Pillars are at the Front, were placed the Statues called the <HI>Colonies:</HI> Within that &s;pace was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Sacred Place,</HI> whether it was a Grove, or Place of Sacrifice, Altar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>Vetus Sacrari|um,</HI> the old Temple and Altar, &s;uppo&s;ed to be built by <HI>Deucalion.</HI> In what Parts the Pillar of <HI>I&s;ocrates,</HI> and the Temple of <HI>Saturn</HI> &s;tood, is uncertain; but it's likely on &s;ome hand or other, from the Entrance. We gue&s;&s;ed, that the Wall of the Front had been plated with Metal, by places that look't as if &s;omething had been in that manner fa&s;tened to them, and afterward broken, or pulled off. But upon &s;econd Thoughts, I rather believe it was placed where the Statues of the Colonies had been fa&s;tened to the Walls. The Marble of the Pillars is not of that &s;ort, which was fetch't from <HI>Pentelicus,</HI> as the re&s;t of the Building and Chapters are; but of a &s;treaked Marble, white, and greeni&s;h. Now from the Topick of <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s Munificence, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> leapeth to the Temples of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Jund, Panathenians,</HI> and from them to the <HI>Pantheon;</HI> and, at la&s;t, to the Hundred and twenty Pillars built by <HI>Hadrian;</HI> but without mentioning their Situation. After this he comes to take notice of a Statue made to the <HI>Pythian Apollo,</HI> and of a Temple &s;acred to <HI>Apollo,</HI> called <HI>Delphinium,</HI> near to the Temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympius:</HI> But of the&s;e, after all our Enquiry, we could find no Remains.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through this Temple Ea&s;twards, you come into the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market place; where on the right hand is a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> which, they &s;ay, was formerly the Cathedral Church: But it was rebuilt by the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ince; and is altogether now a new Fabrick. Within the Court of it we &s;aw two large <HI>Corinthian</HI> Capitals, and an Altar or Pede&s;tal for a Statue, with Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ins carv'd about it, &s;u&s;tain'd by Bulls-heads. But we &s;earched in vain for the Hor&s;es of <HI>Praxiteles,</HI> which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Guilitier</HI> hath told the World of: Nor could we judge this <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> here to be any more a <HI>Pantheon,</HI> than the meane&s;t <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> in all <HI>Turky.</HI></P>

On the Top of the Tower he erected a little <HI>Pyramid</HI> of Marble, and on the Point of it placed a Brazen <HI>Triton;</HI> which held a Switch in his right hand, wherewith, turning about, he pointed at the Wind that then blew. This Tower remains yet entire, the Weather-Cock only excep|ted. The Stones that cover the Top, are divided into many Quarters of whole Stones, re&s;ting upon the Walls of the Tower, and all end in a point on the Top. On each &s;ide of the Tower, is cut a Figure, oppo|&s;ite to the Eighth Quarter of the Winds; repre&s;enting the Nature of that Wind for which it is de&s;igned. Under tho&s;e Figures, on each &s;ide, are Sun-Dials, accommodated to each &s;ide of the Tower, according to the Degrees of Declination, and divided from the Figures of the Winds by a Frize. Each &s;ide is ten foot and a half long: The Height of it we took not, becau&s;e great part of it is buried under Ground.

<P>Towards the South-We&s;t end of the Ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PHANARI DEMOSTHE|NIS.</NOTE> as one goes out of Town to go to <HI>Hadrian</HI>'s Pillars, at the little Convent of <HI>Capuchin Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> is a curious piece of Antiquity. They call it <HI>To Phanari Tou Demo|&s;thenis,</HI> or <HI>The Lanthorn of Demo&s;thenes.</HI> They tell you, That this was the Place, where he &s;hut him&s;elf up, to follow the Studies of Eloquence with greater privacy; having, the more to engage him&s;elf not to ap|pear in Publick, cut off one half of his Beard. But no rea&s;on being gi|ven of this Tradition, it doth not fully &s;atisfie our Curiofity. To give you an Account of this Place, I will fir&s;t pre&s;ent you with the De&s;ign I took of it, together with its De&s;cription; and then my Opinion of it.</P>
<P>It is a little round Edifice of white Marble, very like a Lanthorn; who&s;e Roof is &s;u&s;tained by &s;ix <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars, chanelled, being nine foot, &s;ix inches, and one half long; and the Capitals one foot, and &s;e|ven
<PB N="398" REF="167" MS="y">inches deep; the whole Fabrick within is but five foot, eleven inches, and an half <HI>Diameter,</HI> &s;et upon a <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> of four foot high. The &s;pace between each Pillar, is made up with Pannels of Marble of one Stone, from the top to the bottom; which &s;eems like the Horns of a Lanth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n. So that it is no wonder, that it was called one. Towards the top of tho&s;e Pannels, it is carved with Trivets. The Pillars &s;u&s;tain a Frize of one circular Stone, well carved with Figures, which is al&s;o covered with a <HI>Cuppalo</HI> of one other entire Stone, carved in Scales, and ending in a Stem, formed like a Nozel, or Socket of a Candle&s;tick, with three Beaks, as it were, to lay the Snuffs of a Lamp upon, and a round Hole hewn deep in it, to hold Oyl, or &s;ome Combu&s;tible Matter, to make a Light. The Figures on the Frize are &s;ome fighting, &s;ome dancing; &s;ome doing one thing, and &s;ome another: among&s;t which one is always cloathed in a Lyon's Skin; which made us believe, they were the <HI>Hi&s;tory and La|bours of Hercules.</HI> We told fourteen Clu&s;ters of them: One more re|markable than the re&s;t, is a Man with a Lyon's Skin, going to &s;et Fire to a great Pile of Wood: On which is the Figure of a Man &s;itting with his Hands tied behind him, and a Serpent, that doubleth it &s;elf about him. The Pile &s;eemeth to be made upon a kind of high Rock. Upon the upper part of the Frize, is an In&s;cription, that no Authors have ob|&s;erved, before us. It's of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e I mention'd at the Church of <HI>Panagia Spilioti&s;a,</HI> on the Front of the Grotto, on the South|&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, and importeth that,

<P>Tha is, <HI>Ly&s;icrates, Son of Ly&s;ithidemus of Cicynna, was the Gi|ver, or Pre&s;ident of the Game; That the Lads of the Tribe of Achamas had the Victory; That Theon was Mu&s;ician; That Ly&s;iades of Athens taught, when Euaenetus was Ar|chon.</HI></P>
<P>So that this place mu&s;t needs be very antient. For <HI>Euaenetus</HI> was <HI>Archon</HI> the &s;econd Year of the hundred and eleventh <HI>Olympiad;</HI> which an&s;wers to the four hundred and eighteenth Year of <HI>Romes</HI> Foundation, and was three hundred thirty five Years before <HI>Chri&s;ts Incarnation;</HI> that is, two thou&s;and and thirteen Years &s;ince. Wherefore my Comrade did well to correct his mi&s;take, concerning the Antiquity of Chanelled Pil|lars; which in his former Relation of <HI>Athens</HI> he had received from the Reverend Father <HI>Babin:</HI> where he &s;uppo&s;es them to be of no antienter date than the <HI>Roman</HI> Empetours. It is yet doubtful what this hath properly been, whether a Monument only erected in honour to tho&s;e who were <HI>Victors</HI> in tho&s;e publick Games, or whether &s;ome Part of a <HI>Gymna&s;ium,</HI> or whether it might not be a Temple dedicated by the Victors them|&s;elves in the&s;e Games, to what Deities they thought be&s;t; and particular|ly, whether it might not be a Temple dedicated to <HI>Hercules;</HI> &s;eeing that
<PB N="399" REF="167">upon the Frize one may ob&s;erve &s;ome of his Heroick Actions well repre|&s;ented. The kindne&s;s he had for <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> King of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and the actions he did upon this Subject, might well de&s;erve &s;uch honour from them. From the <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo,</HI> on the Frize, my Comrade be|lieves it was a Play of which <HI>Hercules furens</HI> was the Subject, who burn|ed him&s;elf upon Mount <HI>Aetna:</HI> which I cannot agree to, till I know why the Tribe of <HI>Achamas</HI> had the Victory. It &s;eems to be &s;ituate near that way, which, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> tells, was called <HI>Tripodas,</HI> from the many Bra&s;s Trivets placed in the Temples along it. There are Trivets carved upon this; and mo&s;t probably it might, in former times, have had one placed in it. But whether it be that Temple he before mention'd in that way, dedicated to <HI>Hercules,</HI> I will not po&s;itively determine; al|though the <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo</HI> on the Frize, and the Athletick In&s;cription &s;eem &s;trongly to argue for it. By this a way likewi&s;e might well lead to that Region they called <HI>The Gardens,</HI> being towards <HI>Lycaeum</HI> and River from the <HI>Acropolis,</HI> and not far di&s;tant. It is remarkable al&s;o, that <HI>Demo&s;the|nes</HI> flouri&s;hed at the &s;ame time; as it appears by the In&s;cription upon it, This was built. For he dyed not till the third Year of the hundred and fourteenth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> as <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> ob&s;erveth; which is &s;eventeen Years after the Building of this Monument. So that perhaps he built it; which may be the rea&s;on of the tradition, and the calling it <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> his <HI>Lanthorn.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the chief Monuments of Antiquity now remaining at <HI>A|thens.</HI> But we made a greater Harve&s;t of In&s;criptions there than in all <HI>Greece</HI> be&s;ides: for the greate&s;t part of which we may thank our hone&s;t Con&s;ul, who had collected and copied them before we came. So that we had little to do, but to examine them, and &s;earch out new ones; which we daily did to our &s;atisfaction. Some of the mo&s;t curious I found there, I procured, and ordered to be &s;ent me, by the fir&s;t occa&s;ion, into <HI>Eng|land;</HI> of which, that which I e&s;teem mo&s;t &s;ingular, is this of the <HI>Thirteen Tribes</HI> of the <HI>Athenians:</HI> Which you have in the en&s;uing Page.</P>

<P>This Stone is not intire, but hath the names of all the <GAP DESC="foreign">, tho&s;e Heroes from whom the <HI>Athenian</HI> Tribes had their names; and under the name of each Tribe, are &s;everal names of the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Towns they con&s;i&s;ted of. La&s;t of all, a Li&s;t of many other names under the Title of &Egr;&Pgr;&Egr;&Ngr;&Ggr;&Rgr;&Agr;&PHgr;&Ogr;&Igr;, or &Egr;&Ngr;&Ggr;&Rgr;&Agr;&PHgr;&Ogr;&Igr;; which from <HI>Stephanus</HI> in the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, I believe refers to tho&s;e who were enrolled in the <HI>A|cropolis,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. The learned Sir <HI>John Marskam,</HI> with other our Antiquaries, judge it belonged to a <HI>Gymna&s;ium;</HI> which will further appear, if compared with two other fragments, one of which I have, and the other I hope in a &s;hort time to recover from <HI>A|thens.</HI> That yet at <HI>Athens,</HI> &s;hews what kind of Title that of the Tribes had, being to this purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>After I had done this, and taken &s;ome of the pro&s;pects of the Moun|tains, as the little time I had would permit, I made all the ha&s;te I could down (although very unwillingly &s;o &s;oon) for fear of being benighted: as Mr. <HI>Vernon</HI> was on the &s;ame account, and &s;hut out of the Town; putting the Con&s;ul to a great deal of care and trouble for his &s;afety, be|ing gone out alone, a foot, and without a Guide. The fir&s;t time I went forth with my Companion and the Con&s;ul, we, lo&s;ing our labour by rea|&s;on of the Snow that fell, returned down the neare&s;t way we could, pa&s;|&s;ing by three Mona&s;teries, that lay on that &s;ide of the Mountain. The fir&s;t in de&s;cending is called <HI>Hagio-Jani ho Carias.</HI> The &s;econd is now de|&s;erted, and they &s;ay the Italians had formerly a Church there in common with the Greeks, called <HI>Hagios Georgios ho Koutelas.</HI> The third is called <HI>Hagios Kyriani</HI> by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and by the <HI>Turks Cosba&s;hi;</HI> becau&s;e of a <HI>Sheeps Head</HI> engraven on a Marble-Sepulchre, now made u&s;e of for a Ci&s;tern to the Fountain ari&s;ing there, who&s;e &s;tream falls into the <HI>Ili&s;&s;os.</HI> The Covent is well enough built for that Country, where they do not &s;trive to excel in &s;tately Buildings; but rather to hide them&s;elves as much as they can in ob&s;curity from the World. This Mountain is celebrated for the be&s;t Honey in all <HI>Greece,</HI> of which it makes a great quantity to &s;end to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where it is much e&s;teemed for making <HI>Sorbets.</HI> They u&s;e therefore to bring all the Honey made hereabouts, to be marked with the Mark of this Mona&s;tery of <HI>Cosba&s;hi,</HI> to make it &s;ell the better. We eat of it very freely, finding it to be very good; and were not at all incommodated with any Gripings after it. This Mountain was not le&s;s famous in times pa&s;t for Bees and admirable Honey, the Antients believing that Bees were fir&s;t bred here, and that all other Bees were but Colonies from this Mountain; which if &s;o, we a&s;&s;ured our &s;elves, that it mu&s;t be from this part of the Mountain that the Colonies were &s;ent; both becau&s;e the Honey here made is the be&s;t, and that here they never de&s;troy the Bees. It is of a good con&s;i&s;tence, of a fair gold-co|lour, and the &s;ame quantity &s;weetens more water than the like quantity of any other doth; which they &s;ufficiently experience in making <HI>Sorbet.</HI> They wondred at my Comrade, in that he preferred the white Honey of <HI>France</HI> (as that of <HI>Provence</HI> is) telling him, the white Honey was raw, and not perfectly concocted, either by Nature or the Bees. <HI>Strabo,</HI> I remember, &s;aith, The be&s;t Honey of <HI>Hymettus</HI> was by the Silver Mines: But where they were, is now unknown; unle&s;s hereabouts, by the &s;ame rea&s;on. Now the be&s;t Argument to prove that Bees had their original from hence, is, That here they never de&s;troy or impair the Stock of Bees in taking away their Honey. A thing which I no &s;ooner knew, but I was inqui&s;itive to under&s;tand their Method in Ordering the Bees; which being an Art &s;o worthy the Knowledge of the Curi|ous,
<PB N="412" REF="174">I &s;hall not think it be&s;ide the purpo&s;e, to relate what I &s;aw, and was informed to that effect, by &s;uch as had Skill in this Place.</P>

<P>The Hives they keep their Bees in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ORDERING OF BEES.</NOTE> are made of Willows, or O&s;iers, fa&s;hioned like our common Du&s;t-Baskets, wide at the Top, and narrow at the Bottom; and plai&s;ter'd with Glay, or Loam, within and without. They are &s;et the wide end upwards, as you &s;ee here, (A. B.) The Tops being covered with broad flat Sticks, (as at C. C. C.) are al&s;o plai&s;tered with Clay on the Top; and to &s;ecure them from the Weather, they co|ver them with a Tuft of Straw, as we do. Along each of tho&s;e Sticks, the Bees fa&s;ten their Combs; &s;o that a Combe may be taken out whole, without the lea&s;t brui&s;ing, and with the greate&s;t ea&s;e imaginable. To increa&s;e them in Spring time, that is, in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April,</HI> until the be|ginning of <HI>May,</HI> they divide them; fir&s;t &s;eparating the Sticks, on which the Combs and Bees are fa&s;tened, from one another with a Knife: &s;o taking out the fir&s;t Combs and Bees together, on each &s;ide, they put them into another Basket, in the &s;ame Order as they were taken out, until they have equally divided them. After this, when they are both again accommodated with Sticks and Plai&s;ter, they &s;et the new Basket in the Place of the old one, and the old one in &s;ome new Place. And all this they do in the middle of the day, at &s;uch time as the greate&s;t part of the Bees are abroad; who, at their coming home, without much difficulty, by this means divide them&s;elves equally. This Device hin|ders them from &s;warming, and flying away. In <HI>August</HI> they take out their Honey; which they do in the day-time al&s;o, while they are abroad; the Bees being thereby, they &s;ay, di&s;turbed lea&s;t. At which time they take out the Combs laden with Honey, as before; that is, beginning at each out-&s;ide, and &s;o taking away, until they have left only &s;uch a
<PB N="413" REF="174">quantity of Combs in the middle, as they judge will be &s;ufficient to maintain the Bees in Winter; &s;wee ping tho&s;e Bees, that are on the Combs they take out, into the Basket again, and again covering it with new Sticks and Plai&s;ter. All that I doubt concerning the Practice of this here in <HI>England,</HI> is, that perhaps they gather a le&s;s quantity of Ho|ney; and that, &s;hould they take the like quantity of Honey from the Bees here in <HI>England,</HI> they would not leave enough to pre&s;erve them in Winter. But this hinders nor much: For by being le&s;s covetous, and not taking &s;o much Honey from the poor Bees, the great enerea&s;e and multiplying of them would &s;oon equalize, and far exceed the little Profit we make by de&s;troying of them. This is done without Smoak; wherefore the Antients call this Honey <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&V;n&s;moaeken Honey:</HI> And I believe the Smoak of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> which we u&s;e, takes away very much of the Fragrancy of the Wax; and &s;ure I am, the Honey can re|ceive neither good Ta&s;te, nor good Smell from it.</P>
<P>This Convent payeth but one Chequin, for all its Duties, to the <HI>Vei|vode.</HI> It is a piece of Gold of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Coyn, worth two Dollers, and an half, and about twelve Shillings, <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The rea&s;on of which &s;mall Tribute is, that when <HI>Athens</HI> was taken by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second, the <HI>Hegoumeno,</HI> or Abbot of this Convent was &s;ent by the Town, to de|liver him up the Keyes of the Gates; which <HI>Mahomet</HI> was &s;o glad of, that to te&s;tifie his Joy and Content, and to recompen&s;e the Me&s;&s;enger, he exempted this Convent from all manner of Taxes and Cu&s;toms; re|&s;erving only one Chequin, to be paid as a Quit-Rent for an Acknowledg|ment. The pre&s;ent Abbot is called <HI>Ezekiel Stephaki,</HI> who lives at <HI>Athens,</HI> and is a learned Man for that Country; under&s;tanding the Antient <HI>Greek</HI> very well, and <HI>Latine</HI> indifferently, with a little <HI>Italian.</HI> He un|der&s;tands <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> too, &s;o far as to be e&s;teemed a <HI>Platoni&s;t;</HI> and not|with&s;tanding that he is an Abbot, yet he profe&s;&s;es not to be a Divine, but a Phy&s;ician. In my Return to <HI>Athens</HI> I was daily with him; and of him I learned to read <HI>Greek,</HI> according to the Modern Pronunciation. I found him to be really a good, di&s;creet, and under&s;tanding Man: and what Piques &s;oever have been between the <HI>Beninzueloe's</HI> and him, perad|venture, have proceeded rather from the Emulation of the fir&s;t, than from any ju&s;t or real Cau&s;e given by him. I ea&s;ily perceiv'd, he was not over-fond of &s;ome of the <HI>Greeki&s;h</HI> Super&s;titions: But for all that, he &s;eems to be both a good Man, and a good Chri&s;tian; and that whatever they talk of him otherwi&s;e, are but Trifles, and perhaps unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erv'd.

<P>At another time we went to &s;ee the Sea-Coa&s;ts of <HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">II. To the SEA|COASTS of ATHENS.</NOTE> to|wards the <HI>Saronick</HI> Gulph, and to &s;urvey the antient Harbours along that Shore. So taking Hor&s;es, we directed our Cour&s;e to the Ea&s;tern Point of the Bay <HI>Phalara.</HI> In our way, about a couple of miles out of Town, we pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Athenian</HI> Vineyards, and came to the Ea|&s;tern end of a Mar&s;hy Lake, called by <HI>Xenophon, Phalaraea Palus,</HI> but now <HI>Tripyrga;</HI> becau&s;e there were, as they &s;ay, <HI>three Towers</HI> by it: which probably were the ruines of the Town of <HI>Limne.</HI> This Lake &s;tretcheth it &s;elf in length at lea&s;t three miles along the Shore, and from the Ea&s;tern end of it runneth a little Rivulet into the Sea, not far from the Ea&s;tern Point of the Bay of <HI>Phalara;</HI> where &s;tands a little ruined Church, called St. <HI>Nicholo.</HI> The place, I believe, was antiently called <HI>Colias Promontorium.</HI> From this to the We&s;tern Point, is about three miles? to which we went, continuing along the &s;hore, making a great circumference, till we came where the <HI>Portus Phalareus</HI> was, &s;ituate at the North-We&s;t corner of the bottom of the Bay, and is called now only <HI>Porto.</HI> There remains yet the little Harbour to be &s;een, with part of the Walls that &s;ecured it: But it is now chok'd up with the Sand, and &s;o &s;hallow, that only &s;mall Boats lye there. Neither doth the Bay af|ford any &s;ecure Harbour, as lying open to the South Ea&s;terly and We&s;terly Winds; and Ships that drop Anchor there, are forced to keep a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> large for want of &s;ufficient depth: So that the Antients had very good rea&s;on to change their &s;tation for Ships from hence to <HI>Piraea.</HI> Hard by, are the ruines of the Town, and Ca&s;tle belonging to it, be|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> four miles from <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>Still coa&s;ting We&s;twards a mile or two, we came to another Harbour, called in times pa&s;t <HI>Munichia;</HI> which was then, though but &s;mall, yet a very good and &s;ecure Harbour; but is now quite chok'd up, and u&s;ele&s;s. A little from the &s;hore there are &s;een ruines of Vaults, pieces of Pil|lars and hewn Stones under water; and on the &s;hore, hard by, are many more, be&s;ides Caves digg'd in the Rocks, Vaults, Walls, broken Pillars, and the foundations of a Temple, which we gue&s;&s;ed to be that of <HI>Diana</HI> of <HI>Munichia.</HI> Thence to the raines of <HI>Pitaea</HI> is but a little way, I do not believe much above a quarter of a Mile, going in a &s;treight Line: But going by the Sea-Coa&s;ts, by rea&s;on of the crookedne&s;s of the Shore, it may be ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> two miles: Which &s;hews the errour of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> and our modern Geographers, that follow him; who make them at lea&s;t ten miles di&s;tant from each other: whereas indeed <HI>Phalara,</HI> which is furthe&s;t off from <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aea,</HI> is not at mo&s;t above four miles di&s;tant. But the Shore indeed is almo&s;t formed into a <HI>Penin&s;ula;</HI> in the Neck of which <HI>Phalard</HI> lyeth to the Ea&s;t, and <HI>Piraea</HI> to the We&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Portus Piraeus</HI> is called at pre&s;ent by the <HI>Greeks Porte-Dracone,</HI> and by the <HI>Franks Porto-Lione,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTO|LIONE.</NOTE> by rea&s;on of a Lion of Marble, of admi|rable work, placed at the bottom of the Bay, in a po&s;ture of &s;itting, but erected upon his fore-feet. It is ten foot high, and by a hole pier|ced through it, an&s;wering to its mouth, appears to have been a Foun|tain. There is &s;uch another in the way from <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> in a
<PB N="419" REF="177">couchant po&s;ture. Our French <HI>old and new Athens</HI> told us of a third in the Ca&s;tle, which we could have no account of, unle&s;s he took the fore part of an Hor&s;e, placed on the top of the Northern Wall, for a Lion. By occa&s;ion of this, my Comrade telleth a &s;trange Story, <HI>viz.</HI> Of a Mon&s;ter, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been cau&s;ed by an impre&s;&s;ion made up|on the Phanta&s;ie of the Woman that bare it, by a &s;udden view of it. I do not remember that I was pre&s;ent at the relation, yet becau&s;e e|&s;teem the thing a matter of more than ordinary curio&s;ity, I &s;hall not pa&s;s it by. It happened in the month of <HI>October,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1665. that a Turki&s;h Woman was Delivered of it, in the Citadel, after &s;he had gone with it nine months, as of a Child. So &s;oon as it was brought into the world it leap'd down on the ground, began to go, and make a hideous noi&s;e, re&s;embling &s;omewhat the barking of a Dog. It had Ears &s;tanding upright like a Hares, and his Chaps like a Lion; its Eyes &s;parkled, and had two great Teeth &s;ticking out of its Mouth; its Feet like a Child, but the Fingers of its Hands rather re&s;embled the Claws of Birds of prey; and its Sex &s;carce di&s;cernable. The <HI>Veivode</HI> and <HI>Caddi,</HI> hearing of it, came to make their In&s;pection three days af|ter its Birth, and pre&s;ently gave Sentence of Death again&s;t it; com|manding they &s;hould dig a great hole in the ground, and throw the Mon&s;ter into it; and after that fill up the place again with Stones: which was done upon the Eight of <HI>October.</HI> A French Chirurgion, cal|led Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fanchon,</HI> who lived then at <HI>Athens,</HI> de&s;ired to have the Body, that he might Embalm it, and &s;end it into <HI>France:</HI> But it was denyed him; the Turks affirming, <HI>That it was a Devil;</HI> and that the memory of it ought to peri&s;h with it; in&s;omuch that he was forbidden to come near the <HI>place</HI> where it was buried.</P>
<P>The mouth of <HI>Porto-Lione</HI> is &s;o narrow that two Gallies can hardly enter in a-brea&s;t; having a little Rock, that appears like a heap of Stones, above water, ju&s;t in the entrance: But within, it enlargeth it &s;elf into a con&s;iderable Harbour, with depth enough, and good Anchorage all over; except a little Bay at the utmo&s;t point of it: which &s;eems to have been formerly a &s;mall Harbour for Barques; though now choaked up. But that which I judge mo&s;t con&s;iderable is, that the nature of the place is &s;uch, that though a Ship &s;hould happen to be driven upon the &s;hore, yet it may get off again without damage. Which was tried not long &s;ince by five Engli&s;h Ships, who riding there by force of a terri|ble Storm, had all their Cables broken in one night; and though they were driven to the &s;hore, received no harm at all be&s;ides. The Anci|ents tell, That it was capable of receiving four hundred Ve&s;&s;els: But by our be&s;t ob&s;ervation, we could &s;carce judge it capable of holding more than forty, or fifty of the great Ships of our times. Along the Shore, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it, one may perceive &s;ome Foundations of Walls, and Ruins: And near to the &s;treet, at the mouth, the Founda|tions of two &s;quare Towers, over again&s;t each other. Near to the fir&s;t was the Tomb of <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> that made the <HI>Athenian</HI> Port. But whe|ther it were that great Stone Sepulcher we &s;aw a little further of, near to &s;ome Caves cut out of the Rock, we could not determine. Near the mouth of the Port, we were &s;hewed a Well, among the Rocks, con|taining very good fre&s;h water, notwith&s;tanding it is not above ten yards
<PB N="420" REF="178">from the Sea. The Town that was here in former times, is now utterly ruined, and de&s;erted, with all the admirable <HI>Portico</HI>'s, and Edifices, <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> de&s;cribeth. The only Building that now remaineth is a kind of Ware-hou&s;e, to receive Merchandi&s;es, to gather the Cu&s;toms and Taxes; and where the <HI>Veivode,</HI> for the mo&s;t part, layeth up his <HI>Velania,</HI> to &s;ell to the Merchants.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">om <HI>Porto-Lione</HI> they count it five miles to <HI>Athens,</HI> whence, in old time, it had a wall, which from the length was called <GAP DESC="foreign">.

Now, no more the &s;treet of <HI>Piraea</HI> as in <HI>Pau&s;anius</HI> his time. About mid-way the Con&s;ul &s;hewed us a Well, which Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Guilitier</HI> takes to be the Fountain, near unto which <HI>Socrates</HI> had a Temple dedicated unto him.

<P>The next fair weather that came,<NOTE PLACE="marg">III.

Near unto this Town was the famous <HI>Aca|demia,</HI> from which all other places, celebrated for the liberal Sciences and Learning, have borrowed the name of <HI>Academy.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, fa|mous as it hath been, and is &s;till in great renown, yet is the memory of it here utterly ra&s;ed out, and its &s;ituation &s;o ob&s;curely marked and &s;et out by ancient Writers, that it hath been almo&s;t an in&s;uperable dif|ficulty to determine where it was. Some have placed it in the way to <HI>Capo Colouni,</HI> from <HI>Suidas</HI> his calling it <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>an high place:</HI> there being none &s;uch in this way, but only in that. Wherefore I was much of that opinion al&s;o: But my Comrade &s;hewed me my error; be|lieving that <HI>Suidas</HI> might have &s;ome other rea&s;on for his calling it a <HI>high place,</HI> than that which I thought of: And it &s;eems very probable to have been only from the Tower that was there, from which they be|gan their Races, they ran with lighted Torches in the <HI>Panathenian</HI> Games. Moreover it is plain by that pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Cicero,</HI> that <HI>Ceramica,</HI> was but &s;ix <HI>Stadia</HI> from the gate <HI>Dipylon;</HI> called in times more ancient, <HI>Porta Thria&s;ia,</HI> becau&s;e it led to the Town <HI>Thria,</HI> which was mo&s;t certain|ly towards <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Meur&s;ius pop.

But there is now nothing remaining of it, &s;ave only a &s;mall Church, hard by, which &s;eems to be built out of more ancient ruins; among
<PB N="421" REF="178">which are &s;ome In&s;criptions: and they call the place about it <HI>Palaeo-Chori,</HI> that is, <HI>Old-Towm.</HI></P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed through the Olive-yards, about a mile further, we left an old Tower, a little way to the left hand. My Companion &s;tepp'd to it, and finding &s;everal In&s;criptions upon Sepulchral Pillars, he copied them: and &s;o we came at la&s;t to the end of the plain, to the Sea-&s;hore; where Mount <HI>Corydalis,</HI> running with its We&s;tern point a little into the Sea, makes the Promontory <HI>Amphialia,</HI> about &s;ix or &s;even miles from <HI>Athens.</HI> Between this Promontory and <HI>Salamina</HI> is a Streight, which is not a mile over in the narrowe&s;t part, where we pa&s;&s;ed it over by a Ferry, attending there for Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P><HI>Salamis</HI> is now called <HI>Colouri;</HI> and, as our <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> e&s;teems it, is about fifty Miles in compa&s;s. It hath a Harbour on the We&s;t-&s;ide, eight Miles in length, and three Miles broad in the large&s;t &s;pace. It is of an <HI>Ovael</HI> Figure; and, at the bottom of its Bay, hath a Town of the &s;ame name with the pre&s;ent name of the I&s;land, <HI>viz. Colouri.</HI> This Town, at pre|&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts of about an hundred and fifty poor Cottages, and perhaps of four hundred Per&s;ons. There are two other Villages in the I&s;land; the one &s;ituate upon a Hill, on the South-&s;ide of the Harbour, about five or &s;ix Miles off, and in &s;ight of <HI>Colouri;</HI> and is called <HI>Metropis.</HI> The other called <HI>Ambelachi,</HI> is &s;ituated near the Streight towards <HI>Athens:</HI> They con&s;i&s;t of about thirty Hou&s;es apiece. The antient City <HI>Salamis</HI> was, by this la&s;t, remov'd a little more to the Sea-&s;ide; where it had a little Harbour: in which, at this day, appear many antient Foundations under Water, of carved Stone; and, according to the appearance of Ruins all thereabouts, the City ought to have been near four Miles a|bout.

<P>We &s;aw and copied &s;everal other In&s;criptions, and a little <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo</HI> I found ma&s;oned in the Wall of an old Church; which I prevailed with the <HI>Pappa</HI> to remove, and is one of the three I de&s;cribed at <HI>Athens. Sala|mis</HI> hath many high Rocks and Cliffs: but withal &s;everal fruitful Val|leys, running between them, which bear good &s;tore of Wheat and Bar|ley. Of the Pine-trees on the Hills, they make good &s;tore of Pitch; and of the <HI>Lenti&s;cus</HI> Wood growing there in good plenty, they make Soap|a&s;hes. So that with the&s;e Commodities, and their Fi&s;hing, the Inhabi|tants make &s;hift to get a poor Living; <HI>Athens</HI> being their Market for all.</P>
<P>Above the Village <HI>Colouri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS at SALAMIS or COLOURI.</NOTE> is a high cragged Rock; upon which, a|mong other Plants, I gathered a kind of <HI>Medica;</HI> which creepeth on the Ground, and is be&s;et with Leaves growing clo&s;e to the Stalk, &s;omething like <HI>Kidney-Vetches;</HI> every Stalk being &s;et with them, three, four, five, and &s;ometimes &s;ix upon a Stalk, covered with a Silver Hoarine&s;s. The Flowers follow in little Tufts, of five or fix golden-colour'd Blo&s;&s;oms; the&s;e are &s;ucceeded by crooked flat Cods, like a Half-Moon, and not much unlike to <HI>Gerard</HI>'s <HI>Trifolium lunat&acirc; &s;iliqu&acirc;,</HI> pag. 1217. It agreeth well enough with his De&s;cription, but not with his Figure; for the Leaves of this are not &s;nipped at the Edges, as his. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Merchant</HI> called it <HI>Auricula muris Camerarii.</HI> There is another &s;omewhat like to this; but the Leaves of it are &s;horter, and broader than the other. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">wers grow five or &s;ix together, clo&s;e to a creeping Stalk; each followed with a large Husk, &s;welled like a Bladder, of a &s;hining Silver|colour; which, when the Blo&s;&s;om is pa&s;t, &s;wells bigger: but what Cod it makes, I &s;aw not. I gathered there al&s;o in the Fields, a little kind of <HI>Iris,</HI> or <HI>Flag,</HI> bearing a pretty white Flower, about a handful high from the Ground; and the Leaves no broader nor longer, than the ordina|ry Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>About <HI>Salamis</HI> we ob&s;erved &s;everal other little I&s;lands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">LIPSOCATA|LIA.</NOTE> as between the <HI>Streight,</HI> and <HI>Porto-Lione,</HI> a de&s;art one, called now <HI>Lip&s;ocatalia;</HI> but by <HI>Str&acirc;bo, P&s;ytalia.</HI> Beyond the <HI>Streight,</HI> towards <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> are two other little Rocks, or I&s;lands clo&s;e together; the one called <HI>Megala Kira,</HI> and the other <HI>Micra Kira:</HI> On one of the&s;e it was, called antiently al&s;o <HI>Ke|ra,</HI> that <HI>Xerxes</HI> built a Silver Throne, to &s;it and &s;ee the Battle fought between his and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Fleet; the I&s;&s;ue whereof was, That the <HI>Greeks</HI> handled his great and numerous Navy &s;o, that in the end he hardly e&s;caped him&s;elf in a &s;mall Boat. We contented our &s;elves with the &s;ight of the re&s;t of the I&s;lands in the <HI>Saronick</HI> Gulph, by viewing them from the <HI>Attick</HI> Shore. But our good Friend, the <HI>Con&s;ul,</HI> who had of|ten vi&s;ited them, gave us al&s;o a more particular Account of them; by the help of which, and our own Ob&s;ervation, we are enabled to give a more exact Account of it, than any hath been yet publi&s;hed: which I think very proper to in&s;ert in this Place; becau&s;e the whole <HI>Saronick</HI> Gulph is &s;o frequently mentioned in antient Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>This Gulph is contained within the Promontory <HI>Sunium,</HI> now called <HI>Capo Colonni,</HI> on the <HI>Attick</HI> Shore, and <HI>Schillaeum,</HI> now <HI>Capo Skillo,</HI> on the <HI>Morean,</HI> of <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> Shore; which I &s;uppo&s;e to be about two

There are many little I&s;lands in this Gulph; but the principal are <HI>Aegina, Colouri,</HI> and <HI>Porus:</HI> and the&s;e only are inhabited. They had in times pa&s;t a <HI>Veivode,</HI> and <HI>Caddi</HI> common to them all: But of late they have thought good to make an Agreement with the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> and to pay him yearly &s;e|ven hundred eighty five Dollers for all their Duties: By which means they are left to them&s;elves; and might grow Rich again, did not the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> haunt them &s;o much.

<P><HI>Aegina</HI> is now the chief I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">AEGINA.</NOTE> and giveth Name at pre&s;ent to the whole Gulph, as the River <HI>Saron</HI> did in times pa&s;t.

From Mount <HI>Hymettus</HI> South-We&s;t by We&s;t; and from <HI>Colouri,</HI> or <HI>Salamis,</HI> it lieth almo&s;t South.

The Town con&s;i&s;ts of about eight hundred dwelling Hou&s;es, but now almo&s;t ruined. The Ca&s;tle lieth above it, and is remark|able for little, but the fair Pro&s;pects it affords into all Parts round about it. For from hence many of the I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> are di&s;cove|red, and the whole <HI>Attick</HI> and <HI>Morean</HI> Shore. In this Ca&s;tle are &s;ix Ci|&s;terns, and about four&s;core Hou&s;es; two Churches, joyn'd near toge|ther; one for the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the other for the <HI>Latines:</HI> in which la&s;t remains a fine Sepulcher of Marble, made for a <HI>Venetian Proveditor;</HI> being a Mark of the Dominion they had over it. The Remains of its Antiquity, are the Ruins of two Temples: The one, &s;ituate North-We&s;t of the Town, ought to be that of <HI>Venus,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Pau&s;anias.</HI> It hath but two Pillars now &s;tanding, and a piece of an Architrave on them, with &s;ome Rubbi&s;h below. The other is on the other &s;ide of the I&s;le towards <HI>Athens,</HI> four Miles from the Town, in a Wood, upon a Hill. This is thought to be that Temple, which <HI>Aeacus,</HI> the fir&s;t King of the I&s;land, dedicated to <HI>Jupiter.</HI> It hath yet twenty one Pillars &s;tanding, with their Architraves on them, and many others lying on the Ground. They are of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, chanelled, twenty two foot and an half long; the Architrave thirteen foot and an half long, and about three broad. By the Order of placing them, there ought to have been fifty in num|ber, &s;tanding at a pace and an half di&s;tance from each other.</P>
<P><HI>Aegina</HI> hath great Plenty of Corn, Cotton, Honey, and Wax; al&s;o a|bundance
<PB N="424" REF="180">bundance of Almonds, and <HI>Keratia,</HI> or Carobs.

<P>The Situation of the re&s;t of the I&s;lands is as followeth, beginning at <HI>Promontorium Sunium,</HI> or <HI>Capo Colonni;</HI> and &s;o coa&s;ting along the <HI>Attick</HI> Shore, We&s;twards.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a little De&s;art I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PATROCLEA now GUIDRONI|SA.</NOTE> called now <HI>Guidroni&s;a,</HI> or <HI>The I&s;le of A&s;&s;es,</HI> hard by <HI>Capo Colonni,</HI> South-We&s;twards.

<P>Further is an I&s;land, called now, if my Book be right marked, <HI>Be|noni.</HI> I believe, it may be that, which was called, in times pa&s;t, <HI>Belbina.</HI> And yet, a good way further, near <HI>Lambra,</HI> formerly <HI>Lampra,</HI> there is a Bay; which I judge to have been, in antient times, <HI>Hyphormius Por|tus,</HI> and the Promontory that makes it, <HI>A&s;tipalia:</HI> where there is ano|ther little I&s;land, called <HI>Eli&s;&s;o;</HI> which probably may be that <HI>Strabo</HI> names <HI>Eleu&s;&s;a.</HI> Four or five Miles further, near to a Promontory, which de|&s;cends from Mount <HI>Hymettus</HI> into the Sea, called antiently <HI>Zo&s;ter,</HI> there are five little I&s;lands together, <HI>Comboni&s;&s;a,</HI> the <HI>Buttons,</HI> and, as the <HI>Con|&s;al's Druggerman</HI> noted them to me, <HI>Halicas</HI> or <HI>Selicas,</HI> the <HI>Salt</HI>-Pits; but I &s;uppo&s;e this Name belongs rather to the Promontory, with a ruin|ed Church upon it, bearing the Name of <HI>Hagio Co&s;mo.</HI> There is ano|ther little I&s;land called <HI>La Flega,</HI> I believe the &s;ame that <HI>Strabo</HI> calls <HI>Phaura.</HI></P>

<P>After this we re&s;olved to take another journey, to &s;ee <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">IV.

We therefore made an agreement with an ho|ne&s;t Fellow, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Giraud</HI> u&s;ed to employ, to be our <HI>Agiati</HI> or Guide, called <HI>Jani;</HI> who furni&s;hed us with three Hor&s;es for ten <HI>Timins</HI> a day, that is, about three Shillings Six-pence Engli&s;h Money, he him|&s;elf finding them Meat. He was an admirable Fellow for our purpo&s;e, following us always on foot; and if he &s;aw any old Church or Build|ing near the way, he would pre&s;ently run to it, to &s;ee if he could find any In&s;cription, or other mark of Antiquity upon it: which if he did, he would immediately call out to us, <HI>Scrittione, Scrittione.</HI> He was &s;o u&s;ed to his work both by the Con&s;ul and us, that he &s;eldom made us lo&s;e out labour. If he &s;aw any Flower or Plant that he thought was not com|mon, he would not fail to gather it, and bring it to me; &s;aving me often the labour of lighting from my Hor&s;e, to gather tho&s;e I ob&s;erved my &s;elf. And he did indeed &s;o accommodate him&s;elf to our curio&s;ity, that we had all the rea&s;on in the World to be well &s;atisfied with him, who &s;er|ved us &s;o well, Our Con&s;ul al&s;o was &s;o kind to us as to lend us his Druggerman, armed with his <HI>Barrat,</HI> or Licence, from the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> to &s;ecure us again&s;t <HI>Examinations,</HI> and other hazards we might meet with from the <HI>Turks,</HI> and was &s;o civil as to accompany us him&s;elf as far as <HI>Eleu&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>Thus on <HI>Shrove Tue&s;day</HI> in the Morning, being the 5^t^h of <HI>February</HI> 1675/6, directing our cour&s;e North-We&s;twards from <HI>Athens,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed a|gain the Olive-yards, leaving the way to <HI>Colouri</HI> on the left hand. In an hour and halfs riding over the Plain of <HI>Athens,</HI> we began to a&s;cend the Hill now called <HI>Daphne,</HI> from the abundance of <HI>Oleanders</HI> that grow there, they call <HI>Picra-Daphne,</HI> or <HI>Bitter Laurel.</HI> This Hill begins in the way from <HI>Thebes</HI> to <HI>Athens,</HI> and ends at the Promontory, that makes the Streight between <HI>Salamis</HI> and it. It is divided by this way into two high Points, whereof that towards the Sea was undoubtedly that which <HI>Strabo</HI> calls <HI>Coridalis mons;</HI> the other, <HI>Thucydides</HI> calls <HI>Aegalis.</HI> Moun|ting between the&s;e two tops of the Hill, in half an hour we came to an

Without the Gate is a Well of very good fre&s;h Water; from whence we de&s;cended between the two Ridges of the Hill; and in le&s;s than half an hour came to the Sea-&s;ide. Whence, winding about the Bay, which from <HI>Porto-Lione,</HI> and the Streight of <HI>Salamis</HI> runneth in Northwards, we came to a little Lake of Salt, and Bituminous Water; running out into the Sea by a little Stream, called by <HI>Pau&s;anias, Scirus.</HI> The Lake &s;eems to be the <HI>Rhaeti alvei,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> to be the antient Bounds between the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Eleu&s;inians;</HI> not between <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> as either the Interpreter, or Printer of <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> mi|&s;takes. There is a Hill al&s;o North of it, which had a Town on it, and both called <HI>Scirus.</HI></P>
<P>A little further we came to the River <HI>Cephi&s;us,</HI> which then was but a little Stream; but after Rains, and melting of the Snow from the Mountains, it &s;wells &s;o big, that it overflows a good part of the Plains.

<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the Stream, we continued our way over a &s;pacious Plain, along a Cau&s;way, paved with large Stones, which then was beau|tified with Anemonies of all &s;orts of Colours, mixed and &s;haded between White and Scarlet, and between a deep Blue and White.

<P>Thus, in about four Hours time from <HI>Athens,</HI> we arrived at <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ELEUSIS.</NOTE> now called <HI>Lep&s;ina,</HI> or <HI>Leph&s;ina. Eleu&s;is</HI> was heretofore a City of great Antiquity; and in tho&s;e early times, vied with the <HI>Athenians</HI> for Em|pire, until it was reduced by <HI>The&s;eus.</HI> In the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing times of <HI>Athens,</HI> it was one of their principal Towns; but is now cru&s;hed down under their hard Fortune; having been &s;o ill treated by the Chri&s;tian Pirats, more inhuman than the very <HI>Turks,</HI> that all its Inhabitants have left it; there being now nothing remaining, but Ruins. The Place is &s;ituated upon a long Hill, &s;tretched out near to the Sea, South-Ea&s;t and North-We&s;t, not far di&s;tant from the foot of the Mountain <HI>Gerata.</HI> The whole Hill &s;eems to have been built upon; but chiefly towards the Sea: Where the fir&s;t thing we came unto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEMPLE OF CERES.</NOTE> was the &s;tately Temple of <HI>Ceres,</HI> now laid pro&s;trate on the Ground: I cannot &s;ay, not having one Stone upon another; for it lieth all in a confu&s;ed heap together: the beautiful Pillars buried in the Rubbi&s;h of its dejected Roof and Walls; and its goodly carved and poli&s;hed Corni&s;hes, u&s;ed with no more re|&s;pect, than the wor&s;t Stone of the Pavement. It lies in &s;uch a rude and di&s;orderly manner, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to judge of its antient Form; only it appear'd to have been built of mo&s;t beautiful white Marble, and no le&s;s admirable Work. Some Chapters we &s;aw of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Order, being three foot, nine inches and an half <HI>Diameter;</HI> which belonged to Pillars of two foot, and eleven inches <HI>Diameter.</HI> I took the Dimen&s;i|ons
<PB N="428" REF="182">of a very beautiful Corner-Stone likewi&s;e; being &s;ix foot, five inches &s;quare, two foot, one inch, and a quarter thick. We ob&s;erved many other large Stones among them, carved with Wheat-ears, and bundles of Poppy, bound together, being the Characters of <HI>Ceres.</HI></P>

<P>Hard by, a little more South-We&s;t, among the Ruins of old Walls, we found the Remains of the Godde&s;s her &s;elf; <HI>viz.</HI> a part of her Sta|tue from the Head to below the Wa&s;te, made of very white Marble, of admirable Work, and perhaps of no le&s;s a Ma&s;ter, than <HI>Praxiteles</HI> him|&s;elf, as that was in her Temple at <HI>Athens.</HI> It is a <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> at lea&s;t three times bigger than Nature. She is girt about the Wa&s;te, and two Belts cro&s;s each other on her Shoulders. Her Brea&s;ts appear very natural; but her Face is disfigured. Her Hair falleth back upon her Shoulders, and is tied together near her Neck. Upon her Head is a Basket, carved on the out-&s;ide with clu&s;ters of Wheat-ears, bundles of Poppies, Ro&s;es and Ve&s;&s;els. For it is &s;he, that was &s;aid fir&s;t to have taught the <HI>Grecians</HI> how to &s;ow Corn at <HI>Eleu&s;is;</HI> and Poppies were dedicated to her. <HI>Pan&s;anias</HI> pretends to be forbidden to write of her My&s;teries, by a Dream; it be|ing held unlawful for any to hear, &s;ee, or know them, but tho&s;e that were initiated in them: and none to reveal them. But <HI>Minutins Foelix</HI> knew them, and &s;hews them to have been horribly wicked, and Diabo|lical; which was the Rea&s;on of their Secre&s;ie. I de&s;igned the Statue per|haps well enough, to give &s;ome rough imperfect <HI>Idea</HI> of it; but not to expre&s;s the exqui&s;ite Beauties of the Work. A little higher on the Brow of the Hill we found a large <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> for a Statue, which we judg'd to belong to that of the Godde&s;s. There was written upon it only
&Ngr;&Ogr;&Ugr; &Ngr;&Igr;&Ggr;&Rgr;&Egr;&Igr;&Ngr;&Ogr;&Sgr; &Igr;&Egr;&Rgr;&Ogr;&Kgr;&EEgr;&Rgr;&Ugr;&Xgr;
<HI>Noumilius Nigrinus, Priest;</HI> which, perhaps, was the Name of him that erected the Statue. But that which

<P>While my Companion and I were thus bu&s;ied, our Curio&s;ities were &s;ur|prized on a &s;udden with the noi&s;e of two Guns going off. I pre&s;ently ran to the next convenient place to look down at, to &s;ee what the mat|ter was; which I had no &s;ooner done, but &s;aw <HI>Mouratis,</HI> our <HI>Drugger|man,</HI> lie &s;prauling as kill'd. I quickly call'd to my Companion, and told him we were be&s;et by the <HI>Cor&s;airs,</HI> or Rogues. He thought I je&s;ted; but I a&s;&s;ured him, I &s;aw <HI>Mouratis</HI> lie kill'd, as I thought. Where the <HI>Con|&s;ul</HI>
<PB N="430" REF="184">was I could not tell; but we ha&s;ted to his Re&s;cue, either to &s;ave him, or lo&s;e our Lives with him. So with all the expedition the Rocks and Ruins would give us leave, we ran to the Place; where we found the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> rubbing <HI>Mouratis,</HI> to bring him to Life again: of whom, af|ter we had &s;haken off our &s;urprize, we under&s;tood the matter to be no more than being employed about providing us &s;ome Meat, they &s;tarted a Hare ju&s;t by them; which, as &s;oon as they &s;aw, our Guide took my Fowling-piece, and <HI>Mouratis</HI> a &s;hort Carbine, with a large Bore, charg|ed with four Bullets, and &s;hot at her. But the Carbine having been charg|ed &s;ome days before, and perhaps with a greater quantity of Powder than was fit, in the Di&s;charge, the Piece recoiled &s;o, that it felled him down backward, and &s;truck all the Breath out of his Body. When he came to him&s;elf, it was a good while before we could learn of him what was the matter; and then he could hardly be per&s;waded, but that he had broken &s;ome of his Ribs. But <HI>Jani,</HI> who had in vain run after the Hare, returning, gave us a more particular Account of the Accident, and made us content, that the poor Hare had e&s;caped us, as well as we the danger we feared. It happened at the &s;ame time, &s;ome <HI>Athenians</HI> coming that way from <HI>Corinth,</HI> hearing the Guns go off, and &s;eeing three or four Men of us traver&s;ing tho&s;e Ruins, were frighted as much as we; and concluding us to be <HI>Cor&s;airs,</HI> lying there in ambu&s;h, to rob and do Mi&s;|chief, ran away as hard as they could drive, and hid them&s;elves in the Woods not far off: Where, having &s;taid a pretty while, and beginning to doubt, whether they might not be mi&s;taken, and their Fear ground|le&s;s, &s;ent out a little Boy as their Scout, to di&s;cover what we were; who coming nearer to us, happened to know &s;ome of us: Upon which he re|turn'd, and &s;hewed his Company their mi&s;take. So having comforted <HI>Mouratis,</HI> as well as we could, cau&s;ing him to drink a large draught of Wine; after Dinner we &s;et forward again on our Journey, being very glad that we came off &s;o well; and ble&s;&s;ing God, that this once he &s;uf|fered us <HI>to fear, where no fear was.</HI> Our way lying along under the North-&s;ide of the Hill, where <HI>Eleu&s;is</HI> &s;tood, as we went we ob&s;erv'd the Ruins of an <HI>Aqueduct,</HI> that came in a &s;treight Line from the Mountains North of <HI>Eleu&s;is;</HI> and among&s;t an heap of Rubbi&s;h, the Trunk of a Statue, without either Hands or Feet; which having removed, we found to be of a Sheep, dedicated to <HI>Ceres</HI> by the <HI>Megarians</HI> in antient times. The whole way was then covered with Anemonies of &s;everal Colours, and wonderfully beautiful. After a Miles riding, we turned about the Corner of the Hill to the left hand; and between that, and the Foot of the Mountain, we came to a Spring, which we believed was the Place, where <HI>Ceres</HI> &s;ate her &s;elf down, when &s;he arrived at <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> weary with the fruitle&s;s &s;earch after her Daughter <HI>Pro&s;erpina.</HI> They called it <GAP DESC="foreign">; that is, <HI>Floridus.</HI> It hath but a &s;mall Stream running from it; and I que&s;tion, whether it be not lo&s;t, before it comes into the Sea, in its Pa&s;|&s;age through the Valley, between <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> and the Mountain <HI>Gerata;</HI> which Valley, I &s;uppo&s;e, was that antiently called <HI>Rharius;</HI> where they held, that the fir&s;t Wheat was &s;own by <HI>Ceres</HI> Direction. The Valley is not above two or three Miles compa&s;s; but looks, as it were a Place both fruitful, and well cultivated. But the Plain of <HI>Lep&s;ina,</HI> or <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> which lieth between <HI>Eleu&s;is,</HI> and the Mountain <HI>Daphne,</HI> is about &s;even
<PB N="431" REF="184">or eight Miles long We&s;twards, and three or four broad from the Sea Northwards; is not &s;o well tilled, but abounds with tho&s;e Oaks they make <HI>Vellania</HI> of: But Northwards, towards the Mountains, it is covered with Woods of Pines.</P>
<P>At this Fountain we parted with our <HI>Con&s;ul;</HI> and &s;oon after began to climbe up the Mountain <HI>Gerata,</HI> by a way &s;o ill, that we &s;pent in go|ing up, and coming down, from before two a Clock till after Sun-&s;et. This Mountain is called now <HI>Gerata,</HI> as well as in antient times <HI>Kerata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.</HI> GERATA. KERATA.</NOTE> from two piked Rocks on the top; which &s;hew like two Horns. On one of them is a Tower, called now <HI>Gerata-pyrga.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS.</NOTE> I ob&s;erved much of the <HI>Herba Terribilis</HI> growing upon this Mountain, and of that <HI>Thorney Spurge</HI> I before mentioned; whereof I plucked up a young Root, which was long, and almo&s;t Bulbous; but hollow, and full of Milk. After this we pa&s;&s;ed through a plain for about an hour, and brought Night with us to <HI>Megara,</HI> and lodged at a <HI>Greek</HI>'s Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MEGARA.</NOTE> where we were like to be choak't with Smoak; not could we have been accommodated a|ny where better in the Town, as we were told. For Chimnies are not in fa&s;hion with them. The only way for the Smoak to go out, is either at the Door, or at a Hole made in the top of the Room. There is a <HI>Kan</HI> indeed belonging to the Town; but &s;o ill kept, that there is no Lodging in it. The next day we &s;pent in &s;eeing the Place, and &s;earch|ing for its Antiquities.</P>
<P>This Place hath pre&s;erved its antient Name, <HI>Megara;</HI> and is &s;ituated in a Valley, between the Mountain <HI>Kerata</HI> North, which hath a Ridge running North-We&s;twards, to joyn with Mount <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> at the Bot|tom of a Bay of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, called now <HI>Livado&s;tro.</HI> The whole Mountain is called vulgarly <HI>Macriplai,</HI> or the <HI>Long Mountain.</HI> We&s;twardly, towards <HI>Corinth,</HI> the Plain is bounded with the Mountain, called now <HI>Palaio bouni,</HI> or the <HI>Old Mountain;</HI> and antiently <HI>Gerania;</HI> the Gulph of <HI>Engia,</HI> or the <HI>Saronick,</HI> South-Ea&s;twards, and the Bay <HI>Livado&s;tro</HI> North-We&s;twards. This Territory is not unfruitful, about it is twenty Miles compa&s;s; and was called in times pa&s;t, <GAP DESC="foreign">. The City was built upon two little Rocks, &s;tretched out South, South-Ea&s;t, and We&s;t, North-We&s;t, about two Miles from the Shore of the <HI>Saro|nick</HI> Gulph. It hath the I&s;le <HI>Egina</HI> in &s;ight, South by Ea&s;t, and <HI>Colou|ri</HI> South-Ea&s;t: The antient Bounds of it yet appearing, comprehend tho&s;e two Rocks, and &s;ome part of the Plain Southwards. But now it is only built upon one of the Rocks, con&s;i&s;ting of pitiful Cottages, who&s;e Walls are &s;ometimes only the broken Stones of her Ruins, or Clay dried in the Sun, covered only with Faggots, and tho&s;e again &s;pread over with Earth above them. They are built clo&s;e together; but are only of one Story high; and may be about three or four hundred in num|ber. In the middle of the Town, on the highe&s;t point of the Rock, is a Tower; where a <HI>Veivode</HI> lived, until the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> came, and took him away: which hath ever &s;ince &s;o skared the <HI>Turks,</HI> that they dur&s;t no longer &s;tay there. So that they are now wholly without <HI>Turks</HI> in the Town. But the Chri&s;tians that are, &s;tand in &s;uch great fear of the Pirates, whether <HI>Turks,</HI> or <HI>Infidels,</HI> pretending to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that up|on &s;ight of every Boat in the day-time, and but hearing their Dogs bark in the night, they pre&s;ently fall to packing up their few Goods, which
<PB N="432" REF="185" MS="y">they hide as well as they can, and run away. Not long &s;ince the <HI>French Con&s;ul</HI> at <HI>Athens,</HI> made an Agreement between them and <HI>Crevelly,</HI> the chief of the Pirates of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> to give him yearly an hundred and fifty Mea&s;ures of Corn, to let them live in quiet. They get their living by tilling the Ground; for which they have half the Crop: The re&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> have, as their Landlords, under the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI> They al&s;o make Pitch, and &s;aw out Planks and Boards out of the Pines, and Firrs, which grow in great abundance, on the Mountains about them.

<PB N="436" REF="187">was not then in its full growth; but hath a Root running deep in the Ground.

<P>Next Morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GERANIA, now PALAIO|BOUNI.</NOTE> before it was light, we parted from <HI>Megara;</HI> that we might, if po&s;&s;ible, reach <HI>Corinth</HI> the &s;ame day: For it is further from thence to <HI>Corinth,</HI> than it is from <HI>Athens</HI> thither, and the way wor&s;e. For not a Mile from <HI>Megara,</HI> we began to a&s;cend the Mountain <HI>Palaio|vouni,</HI> by the lower way. For there are two, the one over the top of the Mountain, and the other along the &s;ide of it. This hath a very deep precipice on the left hand, unto the Sea, and the Mountain a va&s;t height above it; and is worthily called <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>Bad Way:</HI> For it is one of the wor&s;t I ever travell'd, for narrowne&s;s, raggedne&s;s, and danger of falling down, &s;ome a hundred Yards headlong into the Sea; which the lea&s;t &s;tumble of our Hor&s;es might ea&s;ily effect. This way, in antient times, was famous for the Robber <HI>Sciron;</HI> who from thence threw head-long into the Sea, all &s;uch as he had robbed, until <HI>The&s;eus</HI> came; who was too hard for him, and ju&s;tly made him ta&s;te the &s;ame Puni&s;hment he &s;o barbarou&s;ly had inflicted upon others, throw|ing him into the Sea from a rocky Precipice: Whence it was antiently called <HI>Scironides rupes,</HI> or <HI>Scironia&s;axa.</HI> The Road is at this time little le&s;s infe&s;ted with the <HI>Ambu&s;cades</HI> of <HI>Cor&s;airs,</HI> than it was of old by that Thief. <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves dread and tremble to go this way, when ne|ce&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions force them to it, for fear of the&s;e People; in&s;omuch, that one <HI>Turk</HI> happening to be on this Road at the time we pa&s;&s;ed by, &s;eeing us to be <HI>Francks,</HI> and knowing the <HI>Engli&s;h Druggerman</HI> that went with us, was glad to joyn him&s;elf to us, and for greater &s;ecurity, to pull off his Turbant, and make a Girdle of it, leaving only a red Skull-Cap upon his Head, like a <HI>Greek.</HI> This whole Mountain was called, in old time, <HI>Gerania;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Megarus</HI> e&s;caped thither in <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, being guided by the noi&s;e of Cranes, called in <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">; as I have el&s;ewhere proved. It is a very high Mountain; of which the&s;e high Cliffs are but upon the &s;ide, a great way below the highe&s;t Point; though they them&s;elves are of a great height from the Sea. As we pa&s;&s;ed along, I ob&s;erv'd the Wind to precipitate it &s;elf &s;trangely down from the top of the Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WIND.</NOTE> into the Sea: &s;ome Bla&s;ts &s;eeming to fall right down upon the Surface of the Water, and there to be divided three or four &s;everal ways, making the Waves to foam as it went. Sometimes I &s;aw the Water agitated for &s;everal Furlongs round about, and in other parts &s;mooth and calm at the &s;ame time, for a con&s;iderable while together; which was a Diverti&s;ement to us, while we pa&s;&s;ed along that dangerous Road. Much time we &s;pent in &s;crambling up and down the&s;e Precipi|ces; which done, we continued along the Shore under the Mountain, until we came to an antient Monument about mid-way from <HI>Megara</HI> to <HI>Corinth;</HI> being rai&s;ed up three or four Yards from the Ground, and eight &s;quard. About it lay &s;everal large Planks of Marble, &s;ome with <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievd's</HI> upon them, and &s;ome without. One of which hath a Man
<PB N="437" REF="187">walking on foot, and a Hor&s;e pa&s;&s;ing by him the other way. Another hath a Figure in a lying Po&s;ture; but much defaced. Not far from hence the antient <HI>Cromium</HI> ought to have been &s;ituated; which was &s;ometimes the Bounds between <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Peloponne&s;us:</HI> But whe|ther this was the <HI>Pede&s;tal</HI> to the Pillar, that King <HI>The&s;eus</HI> &s;et up to be the Bounds between his <HI>Athenians,</HI> and the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians,</HI> I dare not &s;ay; but rather think it was &s;ome <HI>Octogone</HI> Temple: For the Pillar &s;hould be further within the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> where the <HI>I&s;thmian</HI> Games were celebrated. It may well enough be that Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Latona,</HI> which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;peaks of, and placeth hereabouts.</P>
<P>From this antient Monument the plain Ground beginneth to enlarge it &s;elf, between the Mountain <HI>Palaio-vouni,</HI> and the <HI>Saronick</HI> Shoar; al|though the Mountain and plain Ground con&s;idered together, rather be|gins to grow narrow towards the narrowe&s;t Place of the <HI>I&s;thmus.</HI> It makes as much cultivable Ground, as the Plain of <HI>Megara;</HI> but it is utterly neglected, and uninhabited for fear of the <HI>Cor&s;airs.</HI> This was that Spot of Ground, &s;o much di&s;puted for between the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Peloponne&s;ians;</HI> and afterwards by the <HI>Megarians,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Corinth.

But nearer to <HI>Corinth</HI> there is a Village, they call <HI>Hexmillia,</HI> becau&s;e there the <HI>Isthmus</HI> is &s;ix Miles over.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ISTHMUS.</NOTE> We were here &s;hewed the Place, where in antient time they began to cut a Chanel through the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> to joyn the two Seas together: But were forbidden to proceed in their Work, by the Oracle. We alighted to vi&s;it the Ruins of that famous Place, where the <HI>I&s;thmian</HI> Games were celebrated; which was on the Hill, being part of Mount <HI>Oneius</HI> before mentioned. There are yet to be &s;een the Ruins not only of the Town, old Walls, and &s;everal old Churches; but al&s;o the Remains of the <HI>I&s;thmi|an</HI> Theater. Here were many more Temples, and excellent Edifices, mentioned by <HI>Pau&s;anias;</HI> and many more he gives no Account of, we learned from a very fine In&s;cription we found half way in the Ground, by a little ruined Church: Which &s;peaks of many Temples, Gardens, and <HI>Portico</HI>'s, repaired by one <HI>Publius Licinius Pri&s;cus, Juventianus.</HI></P>

It is &s;ituated towards the right hand, ju&s;t within the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> on the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> Shore, being di&s;tant from the Gulph of <HI>Corinth,</HI> about a couple of Miles, and from the <HI>Saronick</HI> Gulph, at lea&s;t &s;ix or &s;even. It hath <HI>Athens</HI> Ea&s;t by South, and Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> directly North; and by M^r <HI>Vernon</HI>'s Calculation, thirty-eight Degrees, fourteen Minutes Latitude. It is not big enough now, to de|&s;erve the Title of a City; but may very well pa&s;s for a good con&s;ide|rable Country Town. It con&s;i&s;ts of the Ca&s;tle, and the Town below it, North of it, and at almo&s;t a Miles di&s;tance nearer the Sea. The low|er Town lieth plea&s;antly upon an ea&s;ie De&s;cent of the Ground towards the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> The Buildings are not clo&s;e together; but in parcels, of half a dozen, or half a &s;core, &s;ometimes twenty together; but &s;eldom more; with Gardens of <HI>Orange</HI>-trees, <HI>Lemons,</HI> and <HI>Cypre&s;s</HI>-trees about them, &s;et with more Regularity, than is u&s;ual in the&s;e Coun|tries; and &s;uch a di&s;tance is between the &s;everal Parcels, or Buildings, as that they have Corn-fields between them. The Hou&s;es are more &s;pruce here, than ordinary; and the bigge&s;t quarter is, where the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market-place is, con&s;i&s;ting of about four&s;core, or an hundred Hou&s;es. There are two <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> here, and one &s;mall Church, called <HI>Panagia;</HI> at
<PB N="440" REF="189">which the Arch-Bi&s;hop liveth, who was then ab&s;ent: And few Marks either of his, or S^t <HI>Paul</HI>'s Preaching, Pains, or Care of this famous Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> are now to be ob&s;erved there.</P>
<P>The next day we went fir&s;t to &s;ee <HI>Panagioti Caballari,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>A|thens,</HI> living mo&s;t commonly here; and letting him under&s;tand our Cu|rio&s;ity, by enquiring after the Antiquities of the Place, he &s;hewed us pre&s;ently, in his Cellar, a fair In&s;cription in <HI>Latine,</HI> of <HI>Fau&s;tina,</HI> Wife of the Emperour <HI>Antoninus Pius.</HI> Some di&s;tance We&s;twards off this, and upon a Ground &s;omewhat higher than the <HI>Bazar,</HI> we went to &s;ee eleven Pillars &s;tanding upright. They were of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, cha|nelled like tho&s;e about the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> and <HI>The&s;eus</HI> at <HI>Athens:</HI> the matter of which Pillars we found to be ordinary hard Stone, not Marble: But their Proportion extraordinary; for they are eighteen foot about; which makes &s;ix foot <HI>Diameter,</HI> and not above twenty foot and an half high; the <HI>Cylinder</HI> being twenty, and the Capitals two and an half. Whereas, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> the <HI>Dorick Order</HI> &s;hould have the Shaft &s;ix times longer than the <HI>Diameter;</HI> as tho&s;e of <HI>Athens,</HI> which have more, rather than le&s;s. But the&s;e are little above half &s;o much. There is a Pillar &s;tanding within the&s;e, which hath the &s;ame <HI>Diameter;</HI> but is much taller than the others, although it hath part broken off, and neither Capital, nor Architrave, remaining near it: &s;o that of what Order it was, is yet uncertain. The others are placed &s;o with their Architraves, that they &s;hew, they made a <HI>Portico</HI> about the <HI>Cella</HI> of the Temple: And the &s;ingle Pillar is placed &s;o towards the We&s;tern-end with|in, as &s;hews it &s;upported the Roof of the <HI>Pronaes.</HI> There is al&s;o another Ruin on the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Bazar,</HI> of Brick-work; which looks like part of &s;ome Temple, or a <HI>Roman</HI> Bath.</P>
<P>This Town is governed by &s;uch Officers of the <HI>Grand Signior's,</HI> as other great Towns of his Empire are; that is to &s;ay, by a <HI>Caddi,</HI> a <HI>Vei|vode,</HI> and <HI>Haga</HI> of the Ca&s;tle. From the fir&s;t of the&s;e we had a Summons, at our return Home to our Lodging, to appear before him, and give an Account of our &s;elves, and of our Curio&s;ity. For we had been ob|&s;erv'd to take the Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e Pillars, and to be very ob&s;erving of the Place. But the <HI>Caddi,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as he under&s;tood by our <HI>Druggerman,</HI> that we were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;hewing him our Con&s;ul's Patent from the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> to travel where we plea&s;ed; he told us, The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were Friends of his Emperour's that we were therefore welcom, and might go whi|ther and when we plea&s;ed. This <HI>Caddi</HI> is counted to have at lea&s;t three hundred Villages under his Juri&s;diction: But the&s;e are little better, than &s;o many Farms, up and down the Plain, between them and <HI>Sicyon;</HI> of which the <HI>Veivode,</HI> 'tis thought, hath the greate&s;t &s;hare of the Profit. When it was known, how civilly the <HI>Caddi</HI> had u&s;ed us, we obtain'd Leave to &s;ee the Ca&s;tle, with le&s;s difficulty, by the Mediation of a cou|ple of Dollers to one of the four <HI>Haga's,</HI> who&s;e turn it then was to com|mand the Ca&s;tle. We went thither on Hor&s;e-back, it being a good hours work to get up to it from the Town; for it is a Mile thence to the foot of the Hill; and thence a very &s;teep way up, with many Wind|ings, and Turnings, before one arrives at the fir&s;t Gate. The <GAP DESC="foreign">, as the Ca&s;tle was antiently called, is &s;ituated upon a very high Rock, having a great Precipice round about it; but not &s;o deep on the
<PB N="441" REF="189">South-We&s;t &s;ide, where the Entrance is. For thence runs out a Ridge of the Hill, two or three Miles Southwards, in the <HI>Morea:</HI> And from thence it was, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second made his A&s;&s;ault, when he took it from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> after fourteen Months Siege; that &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle being the only place, where it is pregnable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Gate we came to, is plated with Iron; where we were made to alight, to go in on foot. This &s;ide of the Rock is well covered with Hou&s;es: For not only tho&s;e who &s;till re&s;ide there, as well <HI>Turks</HI> as <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> have their Hou&s;es and Families there; but for the mo&s;t part, even tho&s;e that dwell below in the Town, have Hou&s;es al&s;o in the Ca&s;tle; where they keep all their be&s;t Goods &s;afe from the frequent, but very uncourteous Vi&s;its of the <HI>Cor&s;airs:</HI> and hither, upon the lea&s;t Alarm, they come flocking with all they can bring with them. The Hou&s;es be|low, being either Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure belonging to <HI>Turks</HI> of Quality; or &s;uch as have been built both by <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> for the grea|ter conveniency of Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s. There are abundance of Ci|&s;terns for Water, hewn into the Rock, and &s;ome Springs; e&s;pecially one, which is toward the Southern-&s;ide of the Hill, which was called, in times pa&s;t, <HI>Pyrene;</HI> being the Place where <HI>Bellerophon</HI> took the Winged Hor&s;e <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> as he was there drinking.</P>
<P>There are three or four <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> in the Ca&s;tle, and five or &s;ix &s;mall Churches; but mo&s;t of the&s;e ruined. The <HI>Catholica</HI> is kept in repair; but is a very mean Place for &s;uch an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignity. In it we &s;aw two old Manu&s;cripts of the Scripture, divided according to the u&s;ual Readings of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church; and two Liturgies of S^t <HI>Ba&s;il:</HI> which we took to be very antient, becau&s;e written upon long Scrolls of Parch|ment, rouled upon Rolls of Wood, as Books u&s;ed to be in antient times; whence they were called in <HI>Latine, Volumina.</HI> We ob&s;erved moreover, That the&s;e Liturgies differed from tho&s;e ordinarily printed at <HI>Venice,</HI> and u&s;ed in their Churches, both in the Sub&s;tance and Ceremony. But as to the Two Epi&s;tles written to this Church by S^t <HI>Paul,</HI> we had but little Account, and as little of their Zeal to his Doctrine as antiently. Under the Walls of the Ca&s;tle towards the Town, is a little Chapel hewn out of the Rock, and dedicated to S^t <HI>Paul:</HI> Whence, when they rally, or &s;peak with reproach of any of that Quarter of the Town, they u&s;ually tell them, They are <HI>of the Race of the Mockers,</HI> and tho&s;e that <HI>laught at St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Preaching:</HI> Of whom it is reported, when one of them received the <HI>Sanctified Bread</HI> from the Hand of a Prie&s;t, according to the manner of their Liturgy, That he almo&s;t bit off the Prie&s;t's Finger; and after that, running mad, finally hang'd him&s;elf upon the Point of a Rock, that is over that Chapel. And the truth is, the Chri&s;tians here, for want of good In&s;truction, and able and faithful Pa&s;tors to teach them, run daily into Apo&s;ta&s;ie, and renounce their Religion for the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Super&s;tition, upon every &s;mall Calamity, and Di&s;content that hap|pens to them; and this not only among the common People, but even the Prie&s;ts al&s;o: of which they &s;ay, There were three &s;ad Examples, not long before our being there.</P>

<P>From the fir&s;t Gate we mounted yet higher, and came to a &s;econd; which is well and &s;trongly built, with two Towers on each &s;ide of it. This Wall I gue&s;s to be about two Miles in compa&s;s, having &s;ome Hou|&s;es inhabited, but many more ruined within them. The two principal Points of the Rock are inclo&s;ed in them al&s;o. On the one, &s;ituated South-We&s;t of the other, is a Tower built; and on the other, being the highe&s;t Point, a little <HI>Mo&s;que.</HI> To the Top of this la&s;t we moun|ted; and had one of the mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pects this World could give us. On the right hand of us, the <HI>Saronick</HI> Gulph, with all its little I&s;lands, &s;trowed up and down in it, to <HI>Capo Colonni,</HI> or the <HI>Promonte|rium Sunium.</HI> Beyond that, the I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> &s;eemed to clo&s;e up the Mouth of the Gulph.

<P>Beyond <HI>Cithaeron</HI> Ea&s;tward follows Mount <HI>Parnes</HI> and <HI>Hymettus,</HI> and between them appeareth the White Temple of <HI>Minerva</HI> upon the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Athens.</HI> By them the I&s;land <HI>Coulouri.</HI> I noted them from hence Ea&s;t: But both by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vernons</HI> account of the <HI>Latitude,</HI> and my own Ob|&s;ervations on Mount <HI>Hymettus,</HI> it ought to be one point more South|wards, to wit, Ea&s;t by South.</P>
<P>The I&s;land <HI>Aegina</HI> in the <HI>Saronique</HI> Gulph South-Ea&s;t. Of the re&s;t of the I&s;les in this Gulph I have already given an account. So I need only &s;ay, they appeared from hence as in a Map before me.</P>
<P>The Plain of <HI>Corinth,</HI> towards <HI>Sicyon,</HI> or <HI>Ba&s;ilico,</HI> is well watered by two Rivulets, well Tilled, well Planted with Olive-Yards, and Vine-Yards, and having many little Villages &s;cattered up and down in it, is none of the lea&s;t of the Ornaments of this Pro&s;pect. The Town al&s;o, that lieth North of the Ca&s;tle, in little Knots of Hou&s;es, &s;urrounded with Orchards, and Gardens of Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, and Cypre&s;s Trees, and mixed with Corn-fields between, is a &s;ight no le&s;s delightful. So that it is hard to judge, whether this Plain is more beautiful to the Beholders, or profitable to the Inhabitants. For it bears great plenty of Oyl, the be&s;t and &s;weete&s;t I ever ta&s;ted. Nor do they want good Wine. But as to Corn it affords &s;o great plenty, as &s;upplyeth the Barrenne&s;s of its Neighbouring Countries. And its Plenty failing, brings mo&s;t cer|tainly a Famine upon their Neighbours round about them. So that this might &s;oon grow to be a rich, and populous Country, were they under any Government, but the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> Tyranny; and not &s;o often per|&s;ecuted and &s;poiled by Chri&s;tian Pirates, who give them many trouble|&s;ome Vi&s;its. I was inform'd, at my return to <HI>Zant,</HI> that a con&s;iderable Party of Pirates had of late &s;uddenly &s;urprized them; and, having &s;ack'd and plunder'd the Town as much as they could, they at la&s;t ham&s;tring'd all their Hor&s;es al&s;o, le&s;t the Turks &s;hould make a head and pur&s;ue after them. I &s;aw not many great Guns planted here: but &s;ome there are planted Northwards, towards the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> Under this We&s;tern Top of the Hill, is a place Walled in: which they &s;ay was the place where the Jews lived, when <HI>Corinth</HI> was under the <HI>Venctians.</HI> They make four di&s;tinct quarters of this Ca&s;tle, each Governed by a di&s;tinct <HI>Haga.</HI> But their Forces con&s;i&s;t now only of the Inhabitants, <HI>Turks</HI> and Chri&s;ti|ans: no Jews are now among&s;t them. The number of Turks and Chri&s;ti|ans &s;eem to be equal, and are e&s;teem'd not to exceed fifteen hundred in number, both in the Town and Ca&s;tle; but there are many more di&s;per&s;ed up and down in the <HI>Zengaries,</HI> or Villages, in the Plain which I do not now reckon.</P>

He was one of the Magi&s;trates of his City; and flattered by the Oracle, a&s;pir'd to the highe&s;t place in it by Coining of fal&s;e money: But for this he was Cha&s;ed from <HI>Sinope,</HI> and fled to <HI>Athens:</HI> where he came acquainted with that great Philo&s;opher, <HI>Anti&s;thenes,</HI> who di&s;puted &s;o much again&s;t the &s;eeking of glory.

<P><HI>Ba&s;ilico,</HI> or as &s;ome call it, <HI>Ba&s;ilica,</HI> was in old time a great City cal|led <HI>Sicyon.</HI> When the Kingdom of the <HI>Morea</HI> was under the <HI>Tenetians,</HI> it was a con&s;iderable Town; now it is but a heap of Ruins, and Inhabi|ted only by three Families of <HI>Turks,</HI> and about as many <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> This final de&s;truction, one of the Inhabitants told us, happened about twenty years ago by the Plague: which they held to be a Judgment of God up|on the <HI>Turks,</HI> for profaning one of the Chri&s;tian Churches there, turning it into a Mo&s;que, by Command of the <HI>Vaivode;</HI> who fell down dead upon the place the fir&s;t time he cau&s;ed the <HI>Alchoran</HI> to be read in it: who&s;e Death was followed &s;oon after with &s;uch a Pe&s;tilence, as in a &s;hort time utterly de&s;troyed the whole Town: which could never &s;ince be re-peopled.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituated upon a Hill about three Miles from the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> and hath the River <HI>A&s;opus</HI> running under it on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide: on which are &s;ome Powder-Mills, as they told us; which are the fir&s;t I ever &s;aw in <HI>Turkey.</HI> There remaineth abundance of Ruins both ancient and mo|dern. The Wall of the Ca&s;tle, many Churches, and &s;ome Mo&s;ques: and a good way off the Ca&s;tle We&s;twards is a Ruin they call <HI>the Kings Pa|lace:</HI> which &s;eems to be very ancient, but made of Bricks. I take it to have been a Bath, from the many Chanels down the Wall to bring Water. Beyond that at a good di&s;tance, is a Hill formed <HI>Semicircular,</HI> I believe by Art, and to have been a <HI>Theater,</HI> or <HI>Stadium.</HI> There are al&s;o abun|dance of Caverns and Vaults in the ground; which we could not &s;tay to examine with any exactne&s;s: but returned part of our way towards <HI>Corinth</HI> that Evening, and lay at a little Village about midway. The next Morning we pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;hore by &s;everal little Lakes, and the anci|ent Port of <HI>Corinth,</HI> called <HI>Lechaeum,</HI> now quite choked up. We left <HI>Corinth</HI> about two Miles off on the right hand, and went two or three Miles further to a Village they call <HI>Heximillia:</HI> where we &s;pent the re&s;t of a wet day, becau&s;e we could not reach to <HI>Megara</HI> that Night: nor was there any where to lodge at in the way. This Village is called <HI>Hexi|millia,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> at this place is &s;ix Miles wide. The next day we came early to <HI>Megara;</HI> and the day following to <HI>Athens.</HI></P>

<P>Before I quit <HI>Attica,</HI> I &s;hall here in&s;ert another Journey I made to the <HI>Promontory Sunium;</HI> although I did it another time after my Camerade and I had parted in <HI>Greece:</HI> that what I have to &s;ay of the <HI>Attica</HI> may be together. <HI>Con&s;ul Gira<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d,</HI> and a Merchant of <HI>Micone,</HI> were &s;o kind to let me have their Company. We &s;et out in Ea&s;ter-Week, and re&s;olved to take <HI>Port-Raphti</HI> in our way, to which our Road lay directly Ea&s;twards from <HI>Athens.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed by Mount <HI>Saint George</HI> on our left hand about a Mile, and made towards the end of Mount <HI>Hymettus,</HI> which we left on the right hand, about four Miles from <HI>Athens.</HI> About &s;ix Miles from <HI>A|thens</HI> we &s;aw on the left hand a Village called <HI>Agopi,</HI> where beginneth the Plain of <HI>Me&s;cigia:</HI> which is all that Tract of Land that is between <HI>Hymettus</HI> and <HI>Promontorium Sunium,</HI> called in times pa&s;t <HI>Paralia,</HI> and was the Portion of <HI>Pallas,</HI> another of the Sons of <HI>Panthion.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e came, and Dined at a little Cell belonging to the Covent <HI>Kyriana,</HI> called <HI>Meto|chi,</HI> which &s;ignifieth a Farm, where &s;ome <HI>Caloiroes</HI> live, to Husband their grounds. After Dinner we took Hor&s;e, and continued our Journey, un|til we came to <HI>Porto Raphti;</HI> which is e&s;teemed eighteen Miles from <HI>Athens:</HI> But I do not believe it above fourteen, or fifteen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORTO RAPHTI.</NOTE> The Bay that maketh this Harbour is &s;ituated on the Ea&s;tern &s;hore of <HI>Attica,</HI> and hath the highe&s;t point of Mount <HI>Hymettus</HI> Northwe&s;t by North. The Southern <HI>Promontory</HI> of <HI>Negropont</HI> Ea&s;t. It is divided into two little Baies, by a &s;harp point, that runneth into the middle of it, and it hath two little I&s;lands, or Rocks towards the Mouth: the bigge&s;t of which lieth Ea&s;t South-Ea&s;t off from the middle point, and giveth the name to the Har|bour, from a Colo&s;&s;ian Statue of White Marble, repre&s;enting a Taylor, cutting Cloth; which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Raphti.</HI> The&s;e &s;ecure the Port again&s;t all Winds coming from the Sea: &s;o that it is not only a &s;ecure Port, but they &s;ay &s;o convenient, that hardly any Wind can blow, but Ships may both go out, and come in with the &s;ame. I believe, this Port was anciently called <HI>Panormus:</HI> from whence the <HI>Athenians</HI> were wont to fail to <HI>Delos,</HI> to carry the My&s;teries of <HI>Apollo,</HI> &s;ent down through all <HI>Greece</HI> from the <HI>Hyperboreans.</HI> Here are al&s;o the Ruins of a Town upon the &s;hore, which was the Town called anciently <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Pra&s;&s;ae,</HI> being the Harbour, where in former times twenty Sail of the <HI>I&s;&s;ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> join'd with the <HI>Roman</HI> Fleet, when they were called to help the <HI>Athenians</HI> again&s;t <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Macedon.</HI></P>
<P>We turned a little to the right hand thence, and after we had rode about &s;ix Miles further, we came to a Village called <HI>Marcopoli.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MARCO|POLI.</NOTE> The Ruins hard by it &s;hews it to have been a con&s;iderable place in old time; but now it hath not above twenty or thirty Hou&s;es remaining. Perhaps it was anciently the Town, <HI>Aegilia,</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Ant&iuml;och. Strabo</HI> calleth them <HI>Aeginen&s;es:</HI> but <HI>Meur&s;ius</HI> corrects him out of <HI>Suidas</HI> and <HI>Stephanus.</HI> In &s;ome ruined Churches I found a few incon&s;iderable In&s;crip|tions, upon Pillars and Sepulchral Monuments.</P>
<P>The next Morning early we parted thence, and after about three
<PB N="448" REF="193">hours riding, came to a de&s;olate Church, but kept in repair by the Vil|lages about it; every one of which have an Olive Tree planted by it: I &s;uppo&s;e to &s;erve for Oyl for the Lamps in the Church. Before the Church, at the We&s;t end of it, is the Tomb of the Founder of the Church: upon which among the Stones, is an ancient <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievo</HI> of a Woman in a &s;edent po&s;ture. Here groweth the bigge&s;t <HI>Lenti&s;cus</HI> Tree I ever &s;aw: Out of &s;everal places of the Body of it, Tears of Ma&s;tick I&s;&s;ued: Which convinced me, that not only at <HI>Scio,</HI> but in all the&s;e parts they would yield Ma&s;tick, if they were cultivated. I gue&s;s al&s;o, that hereabouts the Town, <HI>Anaphyli&s;ta,</HI> was &s;ituated, if not at the Town following, to which after an hour and a halfs riding thence, Southward, we came, being called <HI>Kerateia</HI> from the Karobs, of which I &s;aw &s;everal Trees growing wild. This hath been an ancient, and great City; and did pre&s;erve it &s;elf con&s;iderable, until de&s;troyed by the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> about fifty or three&s;core years ago. They had their <HI>Epitropi,</HI> or <HI>Archontes,</HI> un|til then, who did wear <HI>High-crown'd</HI> Hats, like tho&s;e of <HI>Athens.</HI> I could di&s;cern here, where an <HI>Amphitheater</HI> had been, by the Foundations, and &s;ome other remains of it. In the Church I found an In&s;cription; which I believe would have given me &s;ome light concerning the Antiquity of the place, had it been better pre&s;erv'd. From this place we were three long hours before we arriv'd at <HI>Promontorium Sunium,</HI> the way being very rocky and bad, up-hill and down-hill all along. About midway we pa&s;t over a little Mountain, where in times pa&s;t they digged much Sil|ver, and now &s;ome Copper; out of which, they &s;ay, the Gold&s;miths of <HI>Athens</HI> at pre&s;ent &s;eparate a con&s;iderable quantity of Silver.<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAURIUM.</NOTE> But they let not the <HI>Turks</HI> know &s;o much, le&s;t the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> &s;hould impo&s;e the Slavery of digging in the Mines upon them. I &s;aw abundance of <HI>Cinders</HI> lying up and down in the wayes; which a&s;&s;ured me, that in times pa&s;t they had digg'd great quantities of Metals there. <HI>Xenophon</HI> calls this Mountain <HI>Laurium. Pau&s;anias</HI> and many other Authors mention it: But whether there was a Town called by the &s;ame name, I know not. But if &s;o, it was done by <HI>Xenophons</HI> Coun&s;el, who advi&s;ed them to build a Ca|&s;tle there, le&s;t the Mines &s;hould be neglected in time of War: But if be|fore, I believe it was nearer the Sea-&s;ide: where there is a kind of Har|bour for Boats, to pa&s;s over to <HI>Macroni&s;a.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Promontorium Sunium</HI> is now called by the <HI>Francks, Capo Colonni,</HI> from the White Pillars of the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PROM. SUNIUM, or CAPO CO|LONNI.</NOTE> that yet remain on the point of it, being &s;een a great way from Sea. The Temple is &s;ituated on the top of an high Rock, running far into the Sea. Nine <HI>Dorick</HI> Pillars are &s;tanding on the South-We&s;t &s;ide of it, and five on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. At the South end remain two Pila&s;ters, and part of the <HI>Pronaos</HI> upon which are Engraven many names ancient and modern. The Temple &s;eems to have been inclo&s;ed in a Ca&s;tle by the Foundations of the Walls; below which are other Foundations of Walls: which were undoubtedly the Town <HI>Sunium,</HI> which was reckoned one of the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>Burge&s;s-Towns</HI> of the <HI>Athenians.</HI> On the right hand it hath a little Bay, which was its ancient Port: But it is now quite de&s;erted, as well as the little I&s;land <HI>Patroclea,</HI> lying about a quarter of a Mile South-We&s;t off it. They &s;ay here grows &s;ome <HI>Ebany</HI> yet; but much de&s;troyed by the <HI>Cor&s;airs.</HI> Whence it is, that &s;ome call this place <HI>Ebanoni&s;i,</HI> or the I&s;le of <HI>Ebany.</HI>
<PB N="449" REF="193">Others call it &s;till <HI>Patroclea:</HI> but mo&s;t call it <HI>Guidroni&s;a.</HI> The bad wea|ther this day was a great prejudice to the good Pro&s;pect I otherwi&s;e &s;hould have had from hence, of mo&s;t of the I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago:</HI> notwith&s;tanding which I ob&s;erved with my Compa&s;s, as followeth:

</LIST></P>
<P>We were forced to return on our way back again from the Promon|tory that Evening, becau&s;e we could have neither Meat, Drink, nor Lodging near that place. We directed our cour&s;e therefore more to|wards the Shore of the <HI>Saronick</HI> Gulph, than we did at our coming: and that Evening came to &s;ome Shepherds belonging to the Convent of <HI>Pendely;</HI> where with all the Covert they had, we could &s;carce &s;it dry, it was &s;uch bad weather: and our Inn being only a Tent made of a Hedge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Faggots, covered with &s;ome Blankets over them.

<P>The next Morning we parted early, and after ten or a dozen Miles riding, we came to the Ruins of a Town, built on a Rock, called <HI>En|neapyrgae,</HI> or Nine Towers; from &s;o many Towers formerly &s;tanding on the Rock.

<P>Thence we turned yet a little further North-We&s;twards, and came
<PB N="450" REF="194">into the way to <HI>Athens,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing between two Ridges of the Mountain <HI>Hymettus:</HI> that on the left hand being called <HI>Lambra-Vouni,</HI> becau&s;e of its nearne&s;s to <HI>Lambra,</HI> and the other <HI>Telo-vouni,</HI> which thence de&s;cends with a &s;harp point into the Sea, and making a Promontory now called <HI>Halikes;</HI> but anciently <HI>Zo&s;ter.</HI> Ju&s;t before it are four little I&s;lands, or rather Rocks; they call <HI>Camboni&s;ia:</HI> The Button I&s;land. When we were pa&s;t the&s;e Ridges of Mount <HI>Hymettus,</HI> we came into the Plain of <HI>Athens:</HI> where leaving two Villages, as we pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Cocouvannes</HI> and <HI>Me|nidi,</HI> the one on the right hand, and the other on our left, we arrived at <HI>Athens</HI> by that time it was dark.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now return to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Spon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V. From</HI> Athens <HI>to the Convent</HI> Pen|teli, Marathon, &amp;c.</NOTE> and with le&s;s regret take my leave of <HI>Athens,</HI> and all its reverend Antiquities.

<P>Having thus Ordered our affairs, and made the be&s;t Provi&s;ion we could again&s;t human Exigencies, we parted from <HI>Athens</HI> upon <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the twenty ninth of <HI>February,</HI> 1675/6. Leaving the way of <HI>Porto Raphti</HI> on the right hand, and keeping under Mount <HI>Anche&s;mus</HI> on our left; fir&s;t by the Covent <HI>Hagio A&s;omato,</HI> and then by the place, where the Waters are collected into Chanels, to be carried to <HI>Athens:</HI> after two or three Miles riding through Olive-Yards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANGELO|PICO.</NOTE> we came to a place called <HI>Angelo-pico:</HI> where the better &s;ort of Chri&s;tian <HI>Athenians</HI> come to enjoy the plea&s;ant &s;hades in the heat of Summer, to their little Country Hou&s;es &s;ituate in a Wood of Olives, Cypre&s;&s;'s, Oranges, Lemon-Trees; mixed with Vine-Yards. This may be the <HI>Angela</HI> of the Ancients, with whom tho&s;e of <HI>Pallena</HI> would not marry, becau&s;e of the Traiterous Herald, that di&s;co|vered to <HI>The&s;eus</HI> the de&s;ign of <HI>Pallas,</HI> to &s;et on the City at two places at once. But <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> being thus advertiz'd, &s;et upon tho&s;e that lay in <HI>Ambu&s;cade,</HI> and wholly defeated their Army.</P>
<P>A Mile or two further we pa&s;&s;ed by a Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CALLAN|DRI.</NOTE> called <HI>Callandri,</HI> which is al&s;o &s;eated among&s;t Olive-Yards, and had &s;ome other ancient name: but what, I cannot at pre&s;ent determine.

They are under the Prote|ction of the <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> Mother: for which they pay to the New Mo&s;que &s;he built, &s;ome years &s;ince, at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> yearly &s;ix thou&s;and pound weight of Honey; and are obliged to furni&s;h it with as much more at the price of five Dollars the Quintal.

<PB N="451" REF="194">and Herds of Cattel, together with large Vine-Yards, and Olive-Yards, and want no other conveniences that the manner of their life requireth. The <HI>Seniors</HI> of the Hou&s;e have all Chambers to them&s;elves, with Novices to wait on them. Be&s;ides, I believe the &s;ituation of the place, in Summer time, mu&s;t needs be very agreeable; being between the Ridges of the Mountain, with divers curious Fountains i&s;&s;uing out of it: which are received into Pools to keep Fi&s;h in, and turn their Mills as they pa&s;s. They are &s;haded with Woods of &s;everal &s;orts of Trees: which moderate the heat of the Summer, and furni&s;h them with &s;ufficient Fewel again&s;t the cold of the Winter; which is &s;harp enough there, the top of the Mountain being then &s;till covered with Snow. They have not only this Provi&s;ion for the Body, but have al&s;o a Library of Good Books, to in|form their Minds, though I fear they make but little u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Their Books are all <HI>Manu&s;cripts,</HI> and con&s;i&s;t chiefly of the Greek Fa|thers; mo&s;t of which we found there.</P>
<P>I took notice of <HI>Saint Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> in &s;ix Volums.</P>

<P>A very fine Saint <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> the <HI>Areopagite,</HI> the Titles whereof are in Golden Letters, the whole Book very fairly written upon Velome, and ancient. His Works are highly e&s;teemed at <HI>Athens,</HI> and to be undoubt|edly his.</P>
<P>The Weather being very bad, Snowy, Rainy, and Windy, we were willing to &s;pend that day there, being entertained by the Good Fathers with all the Courte&s;ie imaginable: They made us an excellent Fire, which was but needful; For although there be no very great hard Fro&s;ts in the&s;e Countries, it is neverthele&s;s &s;ometimes extream cold; e&s;pecially when the Winds blow over the Mountains covered with Snow; as then it happened to do, over <HI>Pendelico,</HI> with &s;uch a force, as we were &s;carce able to &s;it our Hor&s;es, nor hinder the Cold from pa&s;&s;ing thorough all the Cloths we could put on: But this bad weather did not cool our Curio|&s;ity: &s;o much, but that after we had refre&s;hed our &s;elves, we took a Guide to go up and &s;hew us the Quarries of White Marble, with the other curious Grottoes of Congelations, hewen into the &s;ides of the Moun|tain. We a&s;cended about a Mile Northward of the Covent, and pa&s;&s;ed over a &s;mall &s;tream in the way, not far from it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grottoes.</NOTE> We found the Grottoes in the Rock are well worth &s;eeing, being hewn a con&s;iderable way into the Mountain, and divided into a great many Caverns, or petty Cells, incru&s;ted with curious Congelations. Some &s;parkle like Walls of Dia|mond; which being broken &s;plitteth into <HI>Talcum.</HI> Some &s;hew like Scenes of Trees, and Woods afar off. We crept down to one near twenty Fathom, by a narrow way, on our hands and feet, to a Foun|tain, they &s;ay in Summer is &s;o cold, one cannot abide ones hands in it a <HI>Pater no&s;ter,</HI> which is a very &s;hort &s;pace of time: that work being u&s;ually di&s;patcht with great Expedition, as well in the <HI>Greek</HI> as <HI>Latin</HI> Church. They hold, that the ancient Chri&s;tians u&s;ed to hide them&s;elves there in times of per&s;eoution. The Mountain there is a perfect Rock of White

<P>About this Mountain I ob&s;erved abundance of that kind of <HI>Arbutus</HI> I before &s;poke of; and of which <HI>Matthiolus,</HI> by his Commentary upon <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> &s;eems wholly ignorant. For this agreeth well with <HI>Dio&s;cori|des</HI> his De&s;cription; But not that which we have growing in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> They call it here <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is not much different from <HI>Di|o&s;corides</HI> his name <GAP DESC="foreign">. What he &s;aith of it is to this effect. <Q><HI>Comarus,</HI> &s;aith he, is a Tree, like a Quince Tree, with a thin Bark, the Fruit of it about the bigne&s;s of a Plum, without a Stone; which when it is ripe, is of a reddi&s;h colour, and is called <GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q> This agrees very well with the Tree I &s;peak of: but the De&s;cription is not perfect. For the Tree is indeed like a Quince Tree, the Leaves being broad like it, or rather like a Pear, and the Bark of it is thin. But withal, it &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd, it is of a reddi&s;h Colour, &s;mooth and &s;hining, as if it were po|li&s;hed. The Branches al&s;o grow at &s;mall di&s;tances in rundles, round the Body, like the Fir-Trees, be&s;et with large broad Leaves, as big as tho&s;e of a Quince, or Pear-Tree, and very like in &s;hape. Within, it is of a &s;hi|ning dark Green, and without of a whiti&s;h Colour, and &s;mooth at the Edges. At the top of the Branches I then &s;aw bunches of &s;mall Flowers of a whiti&s;h Colour; which are &s;ucceeded with a Fruit, in &s;hape like a Pipin, but not much bigger than Cervices, of a red Colour, but dark and &s;mooth, and &s;omething le&s;&s;er than the ordinary <HI>Arbutus:</HI> nor hath it any Stone, but &s;eed. I believe it may be that which <HI>Bellonius</HI> calls <HI>Adrach|nes</HI> of <HI>Candia.</HI> But here I ob&s;erved al&s;o another kind of it, without any
<PB N="453" REF="195">con&s;iderable difference, that I could perceive, &s;ave only the length of the Leaves, and tho&s;e a very little &s;nipped at the edges. The Fruit I &s;aw at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> ripe and green, going thence to <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> But here the Trees &s;eemed to be much larger.</P>
<P>We parted hence the next day about ten in the Morning, and turning about the North-We&s;t &s;ide of the Mountain; in the Plain of <HI>Athens</HI> we came into the way that leads to <HI>Marathon:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CEVISIA.</NOTE> wherein we pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t by a Village about two or three Miles from <HI>Penteli,</HI> called <HI>Gevi&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Cevi&s;ia:</HI> of which <GAP DESC="foreign"> was the ancient name: <HI>Herodes Atticus</HI> above-men|tioned had here one of his Country-Hou&s;es. It is &s;ituate upon the &s;tream, that cometh from the Mountain <HI>Pentelicus.</HI> and falleth into the <HI>Cephi&s;us.</HI> We perceiv'd &s;ome ancient Walls of Marble near the Mo&s;que there, as we went thorough the Village.</P>
<P>Continuing on our way, we pa&s;&s;ed by another ruined Village, called <HI>Stamati;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">STAMATI, and URANIA BRAURON.</NOTE> and then proceeding over a Ridge where the Mountains <HI>No|zea</HI> and <HI>Pendeli</HI> meet, we de&s;cended to a Village at the foot of them called <HI>&V;rania</HI> in the Plains of <HI>Marathon,</HI> about &s;even or eight Miles from <HI>Gevi&s;ia;</HI> It is inhabited by the <HI>Albane&s;e</HI> Shepherds and Herd&s;men, and &s;ituated as it were between two Buttrices of the Mountain. Its pre&s;ent name <HI>&V;ranna</HI> &s;eemeth to be a corruption of the ancient <HI>Brauron;</HI> which probably &s;tood hereabouts, and was celebrated for the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> of <HI>Brauron.</HI> Here began that Province of <HI>Attica,</HI> called <HI>Diacria,</HI> or, &s;ometimes, <HI>Hyperdiacria,</HI> and ended at the Mountain <HI>Parnes,</HI> as <HI>He&s;ychius</HI> telleth us. This part of <HI>Attica</HI> was left by King <HI>Pandion</HI> to his &s;econd Son, <HI>Lycus</HI> being that which lyeth oppo&s;ite to <HI>Euboea,</HI> or <HI>Ne|gropont,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> out of <HI>Sophocles</HI> proveth. So that I believe <HI>Diacria</HI> might contain all that Country from the <HI>Cyno&s;ura</HI> Promontory, which is made by a Ridge of the Mountain <HI>Pentelicus,</HI> running out into the Sea from it, being not far from <HI>Brauron</HI>) and the Mountainous Country of <HI>No&s;ea</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ha,</HI> as far as <HI>Oropus,</HI> being the bounds of <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Boeotia.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>&V;rania</HI> we turned towards the left hand, under the Mountain <HI>No&s;ea,</HI> and after two or three Miles riding left the Town <HI>Marathon,</HI> cal|led &s;till by the &s;ame name, as it was anciently, although now but a poor Village, on our left hand. There we pa&s;&s;ed over a little River, that cometh down from the Mountain, and pa&s;&s;eth by <HI>Marathon</HI> over the Plain into the Sea: and thence proceeding a Mile or two further, we pa&s;t by a Fountain, that pre&s;ently &s;eems to &s;tagnate into the Lake of <HI>Marathon,</HI> &s;o much celebrated for the overthrow of <HI>Xerxes</HI> his Army. Hard by this we pa&s;&s;ed by a ruined Tower, and an old Church; where, in all likelyhood, &s;tood the ancient <HI>Tricorithus;</HI> and about a Mile further came to a little Village of the <HI>Albane&s;es,</HI> called <HI>Chouli:</HI> where we lodged that Night. The Inhabitants of this place have another Village, called by the &s;ame name, on the Mountains, this is too cold for them and their Herds in the Winter; and that is too dry, and too much infe&s;ted with Flies, bred out of the Lake, to be inhabited in Summer. So that it is not to be thought <HI>Luxury</HI> but <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> that makes the&s;e poor people provide them&s;elves Hou&s;es both for Summer and Winter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lake of <HI>Ma|rathon.</HI></NOTE> The Lake of <HI>Marathon</HI> is covered all over with Ru&s;hes and Weeds, more like Mar&s;hy and boggy ground than a Lake; and they &s;ay, that at &s;ometimes 'tis al|mo&s;t
<PB N="454" REF="196">mo&s;t dry. This was famous for the de&s;truction of <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s Army, but now only very large Eeles breeding in it; which tho&s;e of the Covent <HI>Pendeli</HI> come and fi&s;h for: who have a <HI>Metochi,</HI> or Farm, thereabouts, where &s;ome of the <HI>Caloiro's</HI> live, and look after the <HI>Boufolo's;</HI> which love extreamly to feed and wallow in the mire of it.</P>
<P>The next Morning we took Hor&s;e, and rode three or four Miles fur|ther Northward from the lower <HI>Chouli,</HI> and came to the Shore oppo&s;ite to <HI>Euboea,</HI> to an old ruined Town they call <HI>Tauro-castro,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>He|braeo-ca&s;tro,</HI> fituate in the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> that bounds the Plain of <HI>Marathon</HI> beyond the Lake Northwards: where the Shore of <HI>Attica</HI> makes a con&s;iderable Promontory. Thence the Promontory <HI>Sunium</HI> lies directly South: But thence towards <HI>Negropont</HI> it makes a crook, and turns North-We&s;t. This Promontory was undoubtedly called in ancient times <HI>Cher&s;one&s;&s;us Promontorium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHERSO|NESSUS.</NOTE> and this ruin'd Town <HI>Rhamnus,</HI> celebrated all over <HI>Greece</HI> for the Temple of <HI>Neme&s;is</HI> that was there; the Work|man-&s;hip of who&s;e Statue was much admired. The Ruins of this Temple are yet to be &s;een upon a Hill in the middle of the <HI>I&s;thmus;</HI> being at pre|&s;ent only a heap of White Marble. From the Ca&s;tle here I &s;aw a high Mountain of <HI>Euboea,</HI> North-North-We&s;t: which I believe, is that called now <HI>Delphi.</HI> Over again&s;t this place Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, is a Harbour of the &s;ame I&s;land, called <HI>Porto-Bufalo;</HI> and the Southern Promontory of it al&s;o called <HI>Capo Kari&s;to</HI> South-South-Ea&s;t. From the Temple of <HI>Neme|&s;is,</HI> turning about, we had <HI>Porto Raphti,</HI> and beyond that <HI>Capo-Colonni,</HI> South, <HI>Macroni&s;a</HI> South by Ea&s;t. Some other I&s;lands <HI>South, South-Ea&s;t,</HI> between that and <HI>Capo Cari&s;to,</HI> as I think, <HI>Zea.</HI> We &s;earched about for the Grotto of the God <HI>Pan,</HI> in old times very much celebrated in the&s;e parts; but could neither find it, nor hear any news of it.</P>
<P>From hence it would have been our nearer way to <HI>Negropont</HI> to have gone directly on; but they told us, there was no way thence over the Mountain <HI>No&s;ea:</HI> for that coming along from the Mountain <HI>Pentelicus</HI> it ends here towards the Sea in unpa&s;&s;able Rocks and Precipices. We were therefore forced to return as far back as <HI>Marathon,</HI> to recover our way to <HI>Negropont:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MARA|THON.</NOTE> <HI>Marathon</HI> is now but a pitiful ruined Village which we thought not worth alighting to &s;ee, therefore leaving it a little be|yond it, we began to go up the Mountain <HI>No&s;ea,</HI> our way lying along the River I before &s;pake of, which here and there makes little Cataracts, or falls of Water, as it de&s;cendeth into the Plain. What ancient name it had I know not unle&s;s <HI>Charadra,</HI> whence the Town was called <GAP DESC="foreign">. After an hour and half's riding from <HI>Marathon,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by a ruined Village called <HI>Kalingi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">KALINGI.</NOTE> upon the &s;ide of the Mountain; and about as far more on the Plain on the top of the Mountain, another cal|led <HI>Capandritti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPAN|DRITTI.</NOTE> or <HI>Capodritti,</HI> famous for good Wine. One of the&s;e I be|lieve was anciently the Town <HI>Oenoa</HI> of which the Proverb <GAP DESC="foreign">. Thence we proceed almo&s;t to the highe&s;t point of the Mountain, by an ea&s;ie a&s;cent, an hours riding further. Whence I &s;aw the highe&s;t point of Mount <HI>Hymettus,</HI> and <HI>Pentelicus</HI> Southwards, the Gulf of <HI>Ne|gropont,</HI> or <HI>Euripus,</HI> North; Mount <HI>Ca&s;ha,</HI> or <HI>Parnes,</HI> We&s;twards. On this Mountain is a large Plain, bounded with the high Mountains of <HI>Ca&s;ha,</HI> and its own highe&s;t Cliffs towards the Plain of <HI>Marathon;</HI> being a great Portion, or part of <HI>Diacria</HI> above-mention'd. As to the ancient name
<PB N="455" REF="196">of this Mountain, although from <HI>Pentelicus</HI> hither I heard of no other pre&s;ent name that it hath then <HI>No&s;ea,</HI> or <HI>Nozea;</HI> yet I gue&s;s it had for|merly two names: Fir&s;t, That part which reacheth from <HI>&V;rania</HI> to <HI>Ma|rathon,</HI> and again from the Plain of <HI>Athens</HI> towards <HI>Parnes,</HI> to have been called <HI>Brile&s;&s;us:</HI> and that <HI>Thucydides</HI> teacheth me, &s;aying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thucyd.</HI> p. 115.</NOTE> that the <HI>La|cedemonians,</HI> being come with their Army into <HI>Attica</HI> by the Plains of <HI>Eleu&s;is</HI> and <HI>Thrya&s;&s;ius,</HI> leaving <HI>Parnes</HI> on the left hand, and <HI>Aegalis</HI> on the right, pitched their Tents at <HI>Acharna;</HI> and thence, when they &s;aw the <HI>Athenians</HI> would not come out to fight, removing their Camp, they &s;poiled &s;ome of their Towns between <HI>Parnes</HI> and <HI>Brile&s;&s;us,</HI> and &s;o re|turn'd by <HI>Oropus</HI> and <HI>Boeotia.</HI> Whence it is plain, that this part at lea&s;t of <HI>Nozea</HI> confining upon <HI>Parnes,</HI> was called anciently <HI>Brile&s;&s;us.</HI> As to the other part of this Mountain, beyond <HI>Marathon</HI> to the Gulph of <HI>Negro|pont,</HI> it is not &s;o clear; yet I believe it went by another name in times pa&s;t; fir&s;t, becau&s;e it lay not &s;o near the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> way to <HI>Oropus,</HI> as this; which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s over to go thither. And then it &s;eems naturally to be &s;evered at <HI>Marathon</HI> by the River: whence it ri|&s;eth &s;till higher and higher towards the North end, and al&s;o towards the South, making two di&s;tinct Ridges; but chiefly, becau&s;e I know not where to place the Mountain <HI>Lycobettus,</HI> but here; and that with &s;ome probability from the name <HI>Lycabetus:</HI> which &s;eemeth to be derived, either from <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ignifying a Wolf; with which the de&s;art and rocky places of this Mountain might be infe&s;ted: or la&s;tly from <HI>Lycus,</HI> &s;econd Son to <HI>Pandion,</HI> King of <HI>Athens;</HI> who&s;e Heritage, left him by the King his Fa|ther, was all that Mountainous Country, lying towards the I&s;land of <HI>Euboea,</HI> and was called <HI>Diacria</HI> and <HI>Huperdiacria,</HI> and therefore mo&s;t likely the Mountain bearing his name was in his Country.</P>
<P>From the top of this Mountain we de&s;cended, about an hour and more, along a torrent, and came by that time it was dark, to a Town on the &s;ide of the Mountain called <HI>Marcopoli.</HI> The Inhabitants of this place were once, not long &s;ince, about to run away for Poverty and Debt: But the Benignity of the Captain <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who alloweth them the third of their labour, and the ground; hath hitherto kept about fifty or three-&s;core Families of them together, to inhabit there. By &s;ome fragments of Antiquity &s;till remaining; This place &s;hould have been, in ancient times, more con&s;iderable than now it &s;eems. Perhaps it was <HI>Hyttania,</HI> afterwards called <HI>Tetrapolis,</HI> becau&s;e it had four Towns under it, viz. <HI>Marathon, Pro|balinthus, Tricorithus</HI> and <HI>Oinea.</HI> For &s;o I under&s;tand <HI>Stephanus Byzan|tinus,</HI> although others take it to be no particular Town, or City, but all the four Towns jointly to be called by that common name, <HI>Tetrapolis.</HI> But the&s;e &s;eem not to have read far enough in the <HI>Lexicon,</HI> nor to con&s;i|der what <HI>Stephens</HI> there quoteth out of <HI>Andro&s;ion:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Andro&s;ion</HI> &s;aith, it is called <HI>Tetrapolis</HI> by rea&s;on of the four Towns above-named: But that it &s;elf was called in times before <HI>Hyt|tania.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The next day we parted early, and de&s;cending yet lower on the &s;ide of the Mountain, we came to the &s;hore of <HI>Euripus;</HI> along which continu|ing our way two hours and a halfs riding, we came to the mouth of the
<PB N="456" REF="197">River <HI>A&s;opus,</HI> which we had formerly pa&s;&s;ed over in our way to <HI>Athens</HI> from <HI>Thebes,</HI> but was now there &s;o &s;welled with the Rains that had fal|len from the Mountain <HI>Parnes,</HI> that we could not pa&s;s it over on Hor&s;e|back. Therefore we continued our way along the Banks, till we came to <HI>Oropo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">OROPUS.</NOTE> a large Town, con&s;i&s;ting, I believe, of two hundred Hou&s;es. This was undoubtedly the ancient Town <HI>Oropus,</HI> in the Confines of <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Boeotia,</HI> &s;o much conte&s;ted for between the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Thebans:</HI> It is &s;ituated two or three Miles from the Sea, upon the <HI>Attick</HI> &s;ide of the River;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thycydidis</HI> lib. 2.</NOTE> the Region about it being formerly called <HI>Pyrace;</HI> and is, I be|lieve, the narrow Plain under <HI>Parnes</HI> and <HI>Lycobettus,</HI> on the South&s;ide of the <HI>A&s;opus.</HI> About two or three Miles further, being Noon, we pa&s;&s;ed over the River <HI>A&s;opus</HI> by a Ferry, to a Village called <HI>Scamino;</HI> And then we judged our &s;elves quite out of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Territories. And again in <HI>Boeotia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scamino</HI> is a Town almo&s;t as big as <HI>Oropus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SCAMI|NO.</NOTE> and is &s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the River, under a &s;teep Hill North-Ea&s;t of it; whereon, I be|lieve al&s;o, the greate&s;t part of the ancient Town was built. My Compa|nion thinks, that it was called in times pa&s;t <HI>Sycaminon,</HI> as I gue&s;s, from <HI>Laurenburgius:</HI> But I know not their rea&s;on. I believe it to have been a place more con&s;iderable than &s;uch an ob&s;cure Village, if &s;uch a one there ever was; for I can no where find it. The ancient Ruins of this place &s;hew it to have been a large City; The Greeks have yet many Churches in it: among the re&s;t <HI>Hagioi &s;eranda,</HI> or the Church of <HI>Forty Saints, Pa|nagia,</HI> and <HI>Hagios Elias:</HI> which are built out of ancient Ruins; among which we ob&s;erved &s;ome In&s;criptions.

His Brother <HI>Achmet Ba&s;ha</HI> lives in the Town, at the Palace, which was the re&s;idence of the <HI>Proveditore</HI> of the <HI>Veneti|ans,</HI> before this I&s;land was taken from them, by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second. This is &s;ituate on the &s;hore on the Ea&s;tern-&s;ide of the Bridge, and therein we were &s;hewed &s;ome Vaults, with &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ages to go out with Boats to the <HI>Euripus:</HI> where the <HI>Proveditore</HI> of that unhappy time of the Fa|mily <HI>Erizzo</HI> endeavoured to e&s;cape, but was di&s;covered by Spies, taken, and mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly put to death by that Cruel Tyrant and Enemy to Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>His fair Daughter, <HI>Signora Anna,</HI> though &s;he had an equal &s;hare of her Fathers unhappy Fate, yet thereby purcha&s;ed to her &s;elf &s;uch Glory as is worth many times the dying for. For &s;he being courted to his Bed, by the offers of the Empire of the World, by the lure of Crowns and Scepters to tread on, to be made &s;hine with all the glittering Jewels of the Ea&s;t, &s;corned and contemned them, chu&s;ing rather the bloody Pon|yard than all that dazling Grandeur, with the impious and foul Embraces of that Incarnate Devil her Fathers Murderer. In&s;omuch that <HI>Mahomet</HI> being enraged to &s;ee his Lu&s;t, his Glory and his Power &s;o mightily op|po&s;ed and defeated by the Virtue of a tender and weak Virgin, drew out his Cimiter, and in his Fury hewed her all to pieces. Her Memory
<PB N="458" REF="198">is Sacred among the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and highly de&s;erves to be Enroll'd among Glorious Martyrs.</P>
<P>On the Walls of this Palace we found an In&s;cription bearing date MCCLXXIII. which &s;peaks of a work then begun in the Month of <HI>May</HI> 409. Years ago, and Dedicated to the Honour of God, and S^t <HI>Mark</HI> the Evangeli&s;t; by the Illu&s;trious <HI>Nicolas Miliani Baiul</HI> of <HI>Negropont</HI> and his Coun&s;ellers <HI>Michael</HI> of <HI>Andros,</HI> and <HI>Peter Navaiarius.</HI> My Comrade thinks this was &s;ome Chappel, but I rather believe it was this Palace it &s;elf.</P>

<P>By the Water on the &s;ame &s;ide of the City is an old Ca&s;tle, where we were &s;hewed among other great Guns &s;everal Mortar-pieces of &s;uch a prodigious Bore, as are capable to fling Stones of two Foot and three Inches Diameter.</P>
<P><HI>Egripo</HI> is a place very well &s;erv'd with all manner of Provi&s;ions, at very low rates. Mutton is &s;carce worth a penny a pound. Kids and Goats fle&s;h not above an half-penny; Fi&s;h will not &s;ell for more than a Far|thing the pound. Wine is about two pence the <HI>Crondriry,</HI> that is, about our Wine-Gallon. Here al&s;o they make <HI>Sweetmeals</HI> of all &s;orts of Fruits, Quinces, Pears, Plums, Nuts, Wallnuts and Almonds for Sugar; they u&s;e Wine boil'd to a Syrup, and make them grateful enough to the ta&s;t; yet I believe they would hardly plea&s;e &s;ome of our nice Ladies, unle&s;s, perhaps, becau&s;e they were far fetch'd.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be extreamly to blame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Ebbing and Flowing of the <HI>Euripus.</HI></NOTE> if we had not endeavour'd to in|form our &s;elves, as much as po&s;&s;ible, concerning the wonderful Ebbing and Flowing of the <HI>Euripus,</HI> &s;o ju&s;tly admired in all Ages, for one of the great wonders of the World. Our &s;tay here was not long enough to ob|&s;erve all the various changings of its Tydes our &s;elves: But I &s;hall give you the be&s;t account of it I can, from the Informations we had from the Inhabitants and other ingenious men that have re&s;ided long there; and not content my &s;elf to tell you only, that it kept its Motion according to the Tydes of the Ocean, the two days I &s;taid there, and ob&s;erved it. The mo&s;t exact account of it we had from the Je&s;uits, and that confirm'd by the Millers, who have Mills on it, and therefore by long experience and ob&s;ervation &s;hould know the truth be&s;t. They all agreed, that its Tydes were &s;ometimes regular, and &s;ometimes irregular, according to the different times of the Moon. But the Reverend Father <HI>Babin</HI> writ all the particulars of his Ob&s;ervations, in an ingenious Letter to his Friend, the Abbot <HI>Pecoil</HI> at <HI>Lyons:</HI> which I will not undertake wholly
<PB N="459" REF="198">to tran&s;cribe; but in &s;hort give you the &s;um of them, as followeth.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he ob&s;erveth, that this Ebbing and Flowing is perceived ten or a dozen Leagues off, on each &s;ide of the &s;treight, in &s;everal little Bayes along the Shore, by the ri&s;ing and falling of the Water.</P>
<P>Secondly, That its cour&s;e may be con&s;idered as it is in divers times. For it is regular eighteen or nineteen dayes every Month, or rather every Moon, and eleven dayes irregular, or &s;poiled, according to the terms they u&s;e at <HI>Negropont,</HI> to explain this wonder of nature.</P>
<P>It is regular from the three la&s;t dayes of the old Moon to the eighth of the New. The ninth it is irregular, and continues &s;o till the thirteenth inclu&s;ively. The fourteenth it recovereth it &s;elf again till the one and twentieth exclu&s;ively, when it begins again to be irregular until the twenty &s;eventh: as it will be more ea&s;ie to under&s;tand by the following Table.</P>

<P>The dayes that it is Irregular, it flows and ebbs, eleven, twelve, thir|teen, and &s;ometimes fourteen times in the &s;pace of four, or five and twenty hours, as the Father &s;aith, he hath ob&s;erv'd him&s;elf, and was a&s;&s;ured by tho&s;e that keep the Mills, and &s;ee the Wheels of them change very often every day, according to the different cour&s;e of the Water. The Tyde therefore changeth here, not only &s;even times a day, as the anci|ents did report, but a great many times more. For he &s;aith, he &s;taid at one time an hour and half, and &s;aw it change his cour&s;e three times, al|though the Wind blew pretty hard again&s;t it. In the&s;e days the ri&s;ing of the Water is about half an hour, and the falling about three quarters: But the days that it is Regular, it ob&s;erves the &s;ame Rules, according to the Moon, as the Ocean and <HI>Venetian</HI> Gulph doth; that is to &s;ay, that in four or five and twenty hours, it hath two Flowings in, and as many Eb|bings out, lo&s;eth near an hour every day, and is &s;ix hours mounting one way, and as many going back the other way. Thus it doth Winter and Summer, in high Winds and calm Weather.</P>
<P>The differences he ob&s;erved between its both Regular and Irregular Tydes, and tho&s;e of the Ocean are the&s;e. The <HI>Euripus</HI> at High Water
<PB N="461" REF="199">ri&s;eth ordinarily but a foot, or little more, and very &s;eldom reacheth to two feet: Whereas the Ocean, in many places on the European &s;hores, ri&s;eth eighty Cubits high, although in the I&s;les of <HI>America</HI> he ob&s;erved it to ri&s;e no higher than in the <HI>Euripus.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd difference that he ob&s;erv'd, was, that the Ocean, when it Ebbs, retireth towards the full Sea; and when it flows, or ri&s;eth higher, it runs towards the Coa&s;ts. But the <HI>Euripus</HI> ob&s;erves another Rule. For its ri&s;ing Water is, when it runs towards the I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> where the Sea is greate&s;t: and its Falling, or Ebb, when it runs towards <HI>The&s;|&s;aly,</HI> that is, Northwards.</P>
<P>Between the Ebbing and Flowing of <HI>Euripus</HI> is a little &s;pace of time, wherein the Water &s;eems to &s;tand &s;till: in&s;omuch that Feathers or Straws ca&s;t on it cannot be perceiv'd to move in calm weather upon the &s;urface of the Water; all the&s;e Ob&s;ervations this ingenious Father a&s;&s;ures us he often made aboard the Ve&s;&s;els lying in the Harbour; where he had li|berty to do it when, as often, and as long a time as he plea&s;ed. He pro|ceeds al&s;o to make an ingenious Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Opinions of the ancients touching <HI>Euripus,</HI> and the cau&s;es of its various and irregular Motions; for &s;atisfaction herein I refer my Reader to him: adding only that I ob&s;erved, the Chanel of the <HI>Euripus</HI> here maketh &s;uch a turn, that its cour&s;e from the Bridge runneth South-South-We&s;t, which is towards <HI>Attica</HI> and the I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> and the other towards <HI>The&s;&s;alo|nica,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> North-North-Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>March</HI> 1676. we left <HI>Egripo,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Thebes</HI> after about &s;ix hours riding. In the way we pa&s;&s;ed over an indif|ferent high Mountain, about two Miles from <HI>Egripo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TYPO|VOUNI. MESSAPI|US MONS.</NOTE> called now <HI>Typo|vouni:</HI> But I believe anciently <HI>Me&s;&s;apius Mons.</HI> From the highe&s;t place in the pa&s;&s;age over it, we ob&s;erved <HI>Egripo,</HI> Ea&s;t by North. The furthe&s;t part we could &s;ee of the I&s;land <HI>Euboea,</HI> North; and the way to <HI>Thepes,</HI> which was before us, South-We&s;t. About midway we left another Hill on our right hand; which I believe was anciently called <HI>Teume&s;&s;us:</HI> but the pre&s;ent name thereof is <HI>A&s;omata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ASOMA|TA.</NOTE> &s;o called from a Mona&s;tery of that name &s;ituated on it: though in old time it had <HI>Micale&s;&s;us</HI> either on it, or very nigh unto it. By it I al&s;o ob&s;erv'd the pa&s;&s;age over <HI>Typovouni</HI> was Ea&s;t-North Ea&s;t, and <HI>Thebes</HI> in a &s;treight line before us, We&s;t-South-We&s;t. Proceeding a little further we cro&s;&s;ed a &s;mall &s;tream, that I gue&s;s was called by <HI>Pau&s;anias, Thermodon:</HI> which he &s;aith, pa&s;&s;ed by the Mountain <HI>Hypatus,</HI> lying towards the River <HI>Cephi&s;us,</HI> part of which pa&s;|&s;ing formerly through the <HI>Theban</HI> Lake, came this way, taking <HI>Thermodon</HI> along with it about two hours riding off the right hand.</P>
<P>The next day early we parted from <HI>Thebes,</HI> and came to <HI>Livadia</HI> in the Evening, by the &s;ame way we had done before to <HI>Thebes</HI> from <HI>Liva|dia,</HI> when we fir&s;t came into <HI>Greece.</HI> The next day we parted from <HI>Li|vadia</HI> Northward: and about an hour after pa&s;&s;ed the River, that I be|fore &s;aid, ri&s;eth between Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Cirphis,</HI> and runs this way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">TRITON <HI>fl.</HI></NOTE> being probably that which is by <HI>Strabo</HI> called <HI>Triton.</HI> Hard by this place it joineth with another Stream coming from <HI>Livadia,</HI> which was called <HI>Hercyna.</HI> After this we went over a &s;mall Mountain, which I gue&s;s to be that <HI>Strabo</HI> calls <HI>Acontium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ACONTIUM.</NOTE> for it &s;eems to be a Ridge derived from Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us.</HI> From <HI>Acontium</HI> we de&s;cended into a large Plain, where
<PB N="462" REF="200">we pa&s;&s;ed three Rivers; and after five or &s;ix hours riding from <HI>Livadia</HI> we came to <HI>Turco-chorio.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MELAS <HI>fl.</HI></NOTE> The fir&s;t of tho&s;e three Rivers is pretty large and deep, being called <HI>Maronero,</HI> or <HI>Black-water:</HI> whence it is ea&s;ie to gue&s;s it is the &s;ame that in times pa&s;t was called <HI>Melas,</HI> which &s;ignifies the &s;ame thing, that is, <HI>Black:</HI> and agrees very well with the &s;ituation <HI>Strabo</HI> gives it; to wit, that it de&s;cendeth from the Mountains of <HI>Phocis,</HI> as this doth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHARA|DRUS <HI>fl. 1.</HI></NOTE> The third is a &s;mall &s;tream, and may well enough be thought that, he calleth <HI>Charadrus,</HI> which falleth into the <HI>Cephi&s;us;</HI> undoubtedly the la&s;t of the&s;e Rivers, having a large and deep &s;tream watering the Plain in its cour&s;e We&s;twards, running between <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> South, and <HI>Oeta Mons</HI> North: From who&s;e Ridges where they meet bearing North-We&s;twards from <HI>Turcochorio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">TURCO|CHORIO.</NOTE> its Fountain &s;hould ri&s;e at an ancient Town called <HI>Lilaea.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Cephi&s;us</HI> by a &s;tone Bridge not far from <HI>Tur|chocorio,</HI> which is a &s;mall Village of <HI>Turks,</HI> and &s;ome few <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;eated in the middle of the &s;pacious Plain above-mentioned. It hath the high Mountains of <HI>Olta,</HI> and the <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> about two hours riding North: and tho&s;e of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> as much to the South. The highe&s;t Point of <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us</HI> is &s;een hence South by We&s;t, and is called now <HI>Heliocoro,</HI> or as my Camerade &s;aith, <HI>Lycoura:</HI> I rather believe it <HI>Heliocoro,</HI> as it was told me from an ob&s;ervation I made at <HI>Turco-chorio;</HI> which was this. I ro&s;e be|fore it was light the next Morning after our coming thither, and walking out I ob&s;erved, that the Sun &s;hined on the Snow, which lay upon the top of the Mountain, a good while before it was broad-day light in the Plain. But either one or the other may be but a corruption of the more ancient and true name <HI>Lycorea.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Kan,</HI> where we Lodged, were many ancient Pillars and Frag|ments of Antiquity, as al&s;o about the Village: &s;o that it is probable, the place was con&s;iderable in times pa&s;t, though now it be reduced to almo&s;t nothing. The nearne&s;s to the River, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the <HI>Cephi&s;us,</HI> makes me believe it was &s;ome Town of the <HI>Locri Epicnemides,</HI> to which and <HI>Phocis</HI> that River was the ancient bounds.</P>
<P>This was the unlucky place, where we received News, that the Moun|tains were &s;o covered with Snow that they were unpa&s;&s;able, and might continue &s;o for a Month, or &s;ix Weeks longer: Which made my Came|rade make a &s;udden re&s;olution to &s;tay no longer for the Weather; but to return with all the &s;peed he could make by <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> into his own Country: which re&s;olution of his I could no ways hinder by all the rea&s;ons I could give him to the contrary. Indeed to &s;tay there, at &s;uch a mi&s;erable place, was neither convenient nor agreeable. But we might, in the mean time, have gone and &s;een &s;ome other places of the Adjacent Countries, not unworthy our pains, and that not far out of our way; for as I then believed, and afterwards found to be true, we might have pa&s;&s;ed another way, more to the Sea-&s;ide, and under the Mountains. For my &s;elf, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could not &s;o &s;oon be reconciled to the Sea, in &s;uch bad weather, and that Sea&s;on of the Year, to comply with him there|in, therefore though with a great deal of unwillingne&s;s, after a few days &s;taying there, we parted from <HI>Turco-chorio</HI> different wayes. He, with <HI>Morates</HI> our <HI>Druggerman,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Dalia,</HI> a Town at the foot of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> on the North-Ea&s;t&s;ide of it, about five or &s;ix Miles from <HI>Liva|dia,</HI> (where the Fountain of <HI>Melas,</HI> or the River <HI>Maronero</HI> ri&s;eth; and
<PB N="463" REF="200">from thence by <HI>Di&s;tomo</HI> to <HI>A&s;pro&s;piti,</HI> where he Embarqued for <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> and from thence returned home to <HI>Lyons:</HI> I, on the con|trary, going towards <HI>Thalanda,</HI> and the Mouth of the River <HI>Cephi&s;us,</HI> with a re&s;olution, after I had more particularly informed my &s;elf of <HI>Boe|otia,</HI> to return again to <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the ninth of <HI>March,</HI> being thus &s;eparated from my Compa|nion, I left <HI>Turco-chorio,</HI> bending my cour&s;e Ea&s;twards, to go to <HI>Tha|landa.</HI> The fir&s;t thing that diverted me in that &s;olitary condition was, that I &s;oon found my &s;elf on a long &s;treight way, fortified with a deep Ditch on each &s;ide, leading to certain Hills, which I &s;aw a good way off be|fore me. This I took as a good <HI>Omen,</HI> portending &s;ucce&s;s to my Under|takings, it &s;eeming to admoni&s;h me, that I &s;hould not fail to be guarded by Gods good Providence, &s;o long as I travelled in <HI>the &s;treight way of Virtue</HI> and <HI>true Piety,</HI> to my Heavenly Country, <HI>which is on high.</HI> This way is rai&s;ed high, &s;eeming to have been anciently paved, about ten or a dozen Yards broad, and was mo&s;t probably in times pa&s;t a Roman <HI>Via Fo&s;&s;a.</HI> I continued on it about an hour and half, until I came to the foot of the Hill, that lay directly before us. Here the way ending, we &s;aw the Ruins of an old Town, with a little Ca&s;tle belonging to it, &s;eated upon a Rock. Afterwards, a&s;cending the Hill, near the top of it, we &s;aw &s;ome old ruinous Churches, and about two hours further riding, we came by Noon to a Village called <HI>Calopodia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">CALOPO|DIA.</NOTE> The top of this Hill is well cultivated, and planted with Vineyards, e&s;pecially near about the Vil|lage: But we found no good Wine there; although the good Woman, who&s;e Hou&s;e we alighted at, was at that time Vi&s;ited by a near Relation of hers, who &s;tayed to dine with her. The Cheer &s;he made her Friend, was indeed no more than mean; but the Welcome &s;he expre&s;&s;ed was very grateful, hearty, and Chri&s;tian-like; and the chief Ceremony of Civility, which &s;he u&s;ed towards her Relation at Dinner was this; when we were &s;et down, having baked her Bread upon the Hearth, &s;he brought it whole as it was, and pre&s;ents it to her Gue&s;t: who received it, ki&s;&s;ing her hands, and then breaking it, re&s;tored it her again to be di&s;tributed about the Table. We met with no occa&s;ion here to &s;tay us long after Dinner: So being quickly again on our way, as we pa&s;&s;ed out of Town, we ob&s;erv'd many Ruins and ancient Foundations of Buildings on our right hand; particularly of a Temple built of white Marble; the Pillars whereof were Channel'd: but of what Order they were we could not find. We continued yet about three hours upon the &s;ame Mountain, up-hill and down-hill, till we came at length to the brow of it: which gave us the pro&s;pect of the I&s;le <HI>Euboea,</HI> the Sea, and of a fair Plain, &s;tretched out a great length to the North-We&s;t and South-Ea&s;t; and is in breadth to the Seawards at lea&s;t half a dozen Miles. The Sea here maketh a large Gulf between the firm Land and the I&s;land; it being the Sea of <HI>Locris,</HI> as may ea&s;ily be gathered out of <HI>Strabo:</HI> and the mo&s;t Northern Promon|tory of <HI>Euboea</HI> appearing from thence, as lying North-North-Ea&s;t.

<P>This Town may contain five or &s;ix thou&s;and Souls, of Greeks, Jews and Turks, and is a Bi&s;hoprick &s;ubject to the See of <HI>Athens.</HI> My Guide being alone with me, was &s;o timerous here, that he would not go up
<PB N="465" REF="201">and down the Town, as in other places we had u&s;ed to do, for fear we &s;hould be taken for Spies: So that, as to what particulars of Antiquity remain here, and might have been ob&s;erv'd by us, had we u&s;ed our won|ted liberty, I can at pre&s;ent give no account. We parted hence the next Morning Ea&s;twards &s;till under the Hill; The Plain growing now more and more narrow, between the Sea and the Mountains; in which man|ner it held us about two hours riding, until we came to a little Bay, in|to which there runneth five or &s;ix large Streams. They run from under the Mountain hard by; and turn four Mills under the Wheels, not full thirty Yards from their Sources: They come out from the Lake of <HI>Liva|dia,</HI> hard by the Town of <HI>Polea,</HI> which is on the other &s;ide of this Hill, by the Lake, as I was afterwards informed.

<P>The&s;e Subterraneous, or rather Submontaneous Pa&s;&s;ages of the Water, may very well be reckoned among&s;t the greate&s;t Wonders of the World; to accompli&s;h which, both Art and Nature &s;eem to have been &s;o indu|&s;trious, that it is hard to determine unto which of them we ought to give the glory of the work. For here Art &s;eems to excel nature; and yet the greatne&s;s of the work is &s;uch, that it &s;eems no le&s;s apparently to ex|cell the power of human indu&s;try. Therefore &s;ince our Modern Writers are upon this matter wholly &s;ilent, and from the ancients &s;o &s;lender an account of it is come down to us as is altogether unintelligible; I &s;hall be the more particular in my Ob&s;ervations of it, and &s;hall give the be&s;t ac|count of it I can.</P>
<P>Which that I may do to be the better under&s;tood, I &s;hall fir&s;t give an account of the &s;ituation of the Lake, and the Plain in which it is <HI>&s;tagna|ted,</HI> and then of the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages out of the Water of the Lake into the <HI>Euboean</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>This Lake is now called <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Lake of <HI>Livadia,</HI> but by <HI>Strabo Copais,</HI> and by <HI>Pau&s;anias Cephi&s;&s;is.</HI> It is &s;ituate on the North-&s;ide of that large Plain, which is call'd by the &s;ame name of <HI>Livadia,</HI> which is &s;tretched out between the Plain of <HI>Thebes</HI> and the Town <HI>Liva|dia:</HI> the whole <HI>Perimeter</HI> of which Country and Lake is &s;o encompa&s;&s;ed with high Hills and Mountains, &s;o joined one to another, that there is not &s;o much as &s;pace for the many &s;treams and torrents that ari&s;e under, and fall from them to pa&s;s out above ground into the Sea: So that had not the Wi&s;dom of the Creator provided at &s;everal places certain &s;ubter|raneous Pa&s;&s;ages, as Chanels to receive and &s;uck in the Waters, which in
<PB N="466" REF="202">&s;o great abundance, at times, do flow and pour down the&s;e Mountains, and were not tho&s;e Chanels either by nature, or art, and indu&s;try of men kept open and clean&s;ed, all <HI>Boeotia</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in a &s;hort &s;pace of time be drowned, and made nothing but a great Lake, or &s;tanding Wa|ter. For beginning fir&s;t at <HI>Parnes,</HI> that Mountain is join'd to <HI>Cithaeron, Cithaeron</HI> is join'd to <HI>Helicon, Helicon</HI> to <HI>Parna&s;&s;us, Parna&s;&s;us</HI> to Mount <HI>Oeta,</HI> that to <HI>Cnemis, Cnemis</HI> to the <HI>Cyrtonum Mons,</HI> That to <HI>Ptoos, Ptoos</HI> to <HI>Me&s;&s;apius, Me&s;&s;apius</HI> to <HI>Cerycius,</HI> and that again to <HI>Parnes:</HI> Which Mountains, although all, or mo&s;t of them be well enough di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by certain <HI>Cha&s;ms</HI> or <HI>Openings</HI> between them, yet are they all &s;o tacked and link'd together by <HI>High-Grounds,</HI> that before the Waters could find Pa&s;&s;age any way into the Sea above ground, the whole Country below them mu&s;t unavoidably be drowned: which perhaps was one great rea&s;on of <HI>Deucalions</HI> Flood, in which the&s;e parts &s;eem chiefly concerned.</P>
<P>But be&s;ide this Circle of Mountains that encompa&s;s all <HI>Boeotia, Phocis,</HI> and great part of <HI>Locris,</HI> there are other Mediterranean Mountains al&s;o, which are tacked to one another in &s;uch &s;ort that they divide the whole Country into &s;everal particular Vallies; which from a high pro&s;pect look as if they were tho&s;e places in the Earth, the Gyants laid open when in their War with the Gods they plucked up Mountains by the Roots, and &s;et them upon one another, intending to &s;cale Heaven thereby. For &s;o is this Plain of <HI>Livadia</HI> divided from that of <HI>Thebes,</HI> Ea&s;tward by the Moun|tain <HI>Phoenicius,</HI> or <HI>Sphingis;</HI> which joins Northwards to the Mountain <HI>Ptoos,</HI> Southwards to certain Ridges which de&s;cend from <HI>Helicon.</HI></P>
<P>From tho&s;e high Mountains, <HI>Helicon</HI> South-We&s;t, <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Oeta</HI> North-We&s;t, are poured down tho&s;e quantities of Waters into this Plain; which <HI>&s;tagnating,</HI> make the great Lake of <HI>Livadia,</HI> by falling towards the Ridge of the Rocky Hills of <HI>Thalanda</HI> or <HI>Cyrtonum Mons;</HI> again&s;t which the whole &s;tre&s;s and fall of the Waters &s;eems to lean; but are by them, as by a mighty Mound or Bank, kept in from di&s;charging them&s;elves in|to the <HI>Euboean</HI> Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> counts this Lake no le&s;s than three hundred &s;eventy one <HI>Stadia</HI> in Circumference; which amounts to about forty &s;even Miles and a half. But I believe it covers not &s;o much ground at pre&s;ent. For then, in his time, it had one pa&s;&s;age out above ground, into <HI>Hylica palus,</HI> now cal|led the <HI>Theban Lake:</HI> But now the Waters are far lower than that Pa&s;&s;age; and therefore are to be thought very much abated. The form of this Lake is long, being &s;tretched out under the Mountains of <HI>Tha|landa,</HI> or <HI>Cyrtonum Mons,</HI> North-We&s;t and South-Ea&s;t, as far as the Mountain <HI>Ptoos.</HI> In the middle it is narrow, but then enlarging it &s;elf again until it comes to be divided at the South-Ea&s;t end, into three &s;e|veral Bayes: At the two Northmo&s;t of the&s;e Bays are the principal Cha|nels, in a wonderful manner pierced through the Mountains: The whole ma&s;s whereof con&s;i&s;ts of a very hard &s;tone, con&s;iderably high and of a great extent in thickne&s;s, though in &s;ome places it be greater, and in others le&s;s; the &s;horte&s;t Pa&s;&s;age to the Sea being towards <HI>Thalanda,</HI> and the North-We&s;t end of the Lake is at lea&s;t four Miles through the Moun|tain. Where this enters in, under the Mountain, is a Town called <HI>Pa|lea,</HI> &s;ituate towards the North-We&s;t end of the Lake: where it ri&s;eth
<PB N="467" REF="202">again on the other &s;ide near the Sea, are tho&s;e Mills I but now &s;pake of, about two hours riding from <HI>Thalanda.</HI> This &s;eems to be the place, which <HI>Strabo</HI> calls <HI>Anchoe,</HI> where the Town of <HI>Copais</HI> was al&s;o &s;ituated; that gave the old name to this Lake: and by the &s;ame rule on the Sea &s;ide, where the Waters come out of the Lake, &s;hould lye <HI>Larimna Superior,</HI> or that of <HI>Locris:</HI> where <HI>Strabo</HI> makes the Chanels to pa&s;s thirty <HI>Stadia,</HI> or about four Miles, under ground from <HI>Copais</HI> to <HI>Larimna.</HI> The other Chanels I &s;aw on the North-We&s;t end of the Lake, are all a much greater di&s;tance from the Sea, many of them pa&s;&s;ing at lea&s;t half a days Journey under the Mountain <HI>Ptoos.</HI> The Northmo&s;t of the two Bayes la&s;t men|tioned, divides it &s;elf again into three Bayes: the fir&s;t of which entreth under the Mountain by two Chanels: the &s;econd and third by three Chanels apiece. Another Bay al&s;o there is, that divideth it &s;elf into many other little Bays, and tho&s;e again into Chanels: In&s;omuch that I ea&s;ily believe what an <HI>Albane&s;e,</HI> I met there, told me; to wit, that there were at lea&s;t fifty of the&s;e under-ground Chanels, whereby the Lake emptieth it &s;elf into the Sea. For I &s;aw above half the number of them my &s;elf. From <HI>Pro&s;cina</HI> hither, a con&s;iderable part of our way lay along one of tho&s;e Chanels, in &s;everal places of which we &s;aw holes down to it; but could neither &s;ee nor hear the Water, as it pa&s;&s;ed, by rea&s;on the Chanel was every where clo&s;e covered, and much deeper. When we came to a&s;cend the &s;teeper part of the Mountain, we pa&s;&s;ed by ten or a dozen &s;quare Stone-Pits about a Furlong di&s;tant one from another; which I found &s;till deeper and deeper according to the ri&s;ing of the Mountain; until by the &s;ound of the Stones I ca&s;t in, I could not judge them le&s;s than fifty Fathom deep; but I heard no &s;ound of Water at the bottom: The rea&s;on whereof I found becau&s;e the Chanel, which carries the Water, lyeth covered deeper under them. They are about four foot &s;quare a piece at the Mouth, and cut out of the hard Rock of the Mountain. From all which I began to be &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t labour, co&s;t, and inde|fatigable indu&s;try, that brought the whole work to &s;uch perfection. For by &s;uch Pits as the&s;e the re&s;t of the fifty Chanels were fir&s;t made, if made at all, and are now upon occa&s;ion clean&s;ed, when ever they happen to be ob&s;tructed. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, that the ancients believed that <HI>Hercules</HI> made this Lake by turning the River <HI>Cephi&s;us</HI> into the Plain of the <HI>Orcho|meni;</HI> whereas before his time it pa&s;t into the Sea by Chanels under the Mountains: I rather believe, that <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;topped the <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Pa&s;&s;age under the Mountain; which the <HI>Orchomeni</HI> opened again after|wards; for that in <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his own opinion &s;eems very unlikely, be|cau&s;e the <HI>Orchomeni,</HI> in the time of the Trojan Wars were the mo&s;t po|tent and rich of all tho&s;e parts of <HI>Greece.</HI> But to me it &s;eems altogether impo&s;&s;ible, for &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Cephi&s;us</HI> had another way under ground than where the Lake &s;tands, which to me is no way probable. Yet there are abundance of other &s;treams falling from the <HI>Helicon</HI> and <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> &s;ufficient to make this Lake, and drown the Country without that. But how ever this was, I am &s;ure the greatne&s;s and difficulty of the work was &s;uch, that there was more need of an Army of <HI>Hercules</HI>'s to have done it, than of one &s;ingle per&s;on to &s;poil it. But by aid of which of the Gods, or by what mean it was perform'd I find not. I have &s;een none of the <HI>Roman</HI> Works greater, nor any thing in nature or art more worthy of admiration.</P>
<PB N="468" REF="203">
<P>From the Northmo&s;t of the&s;e Bayes, where this Chanel entreth into the Mountain, I ob&s;erved, that the highe&s;t point of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> lay We&s;t-North-We&s;t: Some part of the <HI>Helicon,</HI> not covered by the Mountain <HI>Phoenicius</HI> or <HI>Sphingis,</HI> We&s;t.</P>
<P>South, and South-We&s;tward of the&s;e two Bayes, about &s;ix or &s;even Miles di&s;tant, there is another Bay of the Lake divided from the&s;e by a Ridge or Promontory, running out from the Mountain <HI>Ptoos:</HI> which Ridge is now called <HI>Cocino,</HI> from a Town on it of the &s;ame name. Near, or at the end of this Bay, the Mountain, which the ancients &s;eem to call <HI>Phoenicius,</HI> or <HI>Sphingis,</HI> is joined to that of <HI>Cocino,</HI> only there is one narrow &s;lit between them; which I judge can be no other than that only Pa&s;&s;age of the Lake <HI>above ground</HI> into the <HI>Hylica palus,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Strabo Lib. IX.</HI> But at pre&s;ent no Water pa&s;&s;eth that way above ground; nor, as I could perceive, under ground: yet there hath been an old Chanel under this gap, that is tumbled in, and now, as far as I could gue&s;s, quite &s;topped up. This Gap, or Pa&s;&s;age, was al&s;o cut thorough the hard Rock, for a Mile or two, to bring it to the <HI>Theban</HI> Lake: which without doubt was the &s;ame with <HI>Hylica palus</HI> of the Ancients: of which I will next give an account in its due place.</P>
<P>From the&s;e <HI>Catabathra,</HI> as they call them, or Chanels under-ground, we were conducted about three or four Miles South-We&s;twards, up to the Village <HI>Cocino,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COCINO.</NOTE> on the Ridge of the Mountain that bears the &s;ame name. Hard by it I was &s;hewed &s;ome ruined Churches, with two or three old Towns lying in the &s;ame condition; among the ruins whereof were &s;ome few pieces of Antiquity. Pa&s;&s;ing between the&s;e ruins and <HI>Cocino,</HI> I ob&s;erv'd a Spring in the Mountain that waters the whole Town. The Inhabitants of this Village are all <HI>Albane&s;es;</HI> and, I believe I bely them not, the whole place little better than a Ne&s;t of Thieves, of which our Landlord was the Chief. For at Midnight there was Intelligence brought him by &s;ome of his Gang, that they had &s;tollen a Hor&s;e, de&s;iring his advice how to di&s;po&s;e of it; which our Guide under&s;tanding, gave us notice thereof, wi&s;hing us to &s;tand on our Guard: which we did, keeping our Carabins clo&s;e to our &s;ides: But our Guide, I believe, had made them well nigh as much afraid of us, as we were of them. For our Ho&s;t having been very inqui&s;itive to know of him who I was, he made him believe (as the&s;e <HI>Greeks</HI> never want invention to help them&s;elves out at a dead lift) that I was <HI>Scrivan,</HI> or Secretary to the <HI>Captain Ba&s;ha</HI> of the <HI>Negropont.</HI> As to the ancient name of this place I can find no traces in ancient Authors to inform me.</P>
<P>The next Morning we parted from thence early, and turning about the &s;ide of the Mountain, who&s;e top we always kept at our right hand, in half in hours time we came to a narrow Pa&s;&s;age between the Moun|tain <HI>Ptoos,</HI> and this Ridge of it now called <HI>Cocino;</HI> which gave us a fair pro&s;pect over the Lake of <HI>Thebes:</HI> which &s;o &s;oon as I &s;aw, I alighted off my Hor&s;e, and climb'd up to the highe&s;t point of <HI>Cocino,</HI> to take the bet|ter pro&s;pect of it, and <HI>Copais Lacus</HI> together; finding them &s;o near to each other: which although it co&s;t me no &s;mall quantity of the &s;weat of my Brows; yet I found it well worth my pains. For it gave me not only the pro&s;pect of both the Lakes together, but of much of the Country about them. I found the <HI>Catabathra</HI> on the other &s;ide of the Mountain,
<PB N="469" REF="203">North off me, and the <HI>Theban</HI> Lake on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide South. The highe&s;t point of the Mountain over <HI>Thalanda,</HI> North-We&s;t by We&s;t; of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> We&s;t-North-We&s;t.

Thence South|wards join <HI>Cithaeron</HI> and <HI>Parnes;</HI> which divide <HI>Attica</HI> from <HI>Boeotia.</HI> Hence I took the Scheme of both the Lakes as I have given you them in the Map. Of <HI>Copais</HI> I have already &s;poken: But of this of <HI>Thebes,</HI> or <HI>Hylica Palus,</HI> I &s;hall now give you the De&s;cription.</P>
<P>This Lake is now called <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>Theban</HI> Lake;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Thebane <HI>Lake</HI> Hylica Palus.</NOTE> but anci|ently <HI>Hylica palus.</HI> It is much le&s;s than that of <HI>Copais,</HI> and is inclo&s;ed with Mountains round about it.

The Mountain <HI>Ptoos</HI> lyeth North-Ea&s;t of it; Mount <HI>Hypatus</HI> between it and <HI>Thebes</HI> South, and South-Ea&s;t: between which it findeth its way into the Sea, Northward of the <HI>Euripus:</HI> But whether wholly above-ground, I am not able to determine. From this Hill it &s;eems like the leaf of &s;ome Plant; whereof its &s;everal Bayes are the divi&s;ions of the leaf, and the Chanel that runs Ea&s;tward out of it, looks like the &s;tem. It &s;eems not more long than large, and is about four or five Miles over. Great part of the Lake was then covered with all &s;orts of Wild-Fowl, and they &s;ay 'tis full of Fi&s;h: notwith&s;tanding they tell a &s;tory, that every thirtieth or one and thirti|eth Year it is quite dried up: From what hath been &s;aid, tho&s;e that have good skill in the Greek Tongue, may be able to under&s;tand that very defective place in <HI>Strabo,</HI> where he &s;peaks of the&s;e two Lakes, and re&s;tore it again.</P>
<P>When I returned again down the Mountain to my Guide, I found my <HI>Caravochero</HI> almo&s;t in de&s;pair of my returning again &s;afe to him, fearing I had been &s;et upon by &s;ome of the <HI>Albane&s;es</HI> of the Mountains. But thanks be to God it was otherwi&s;e: De&s;cending therefore together from that pa&s;&s;age, yet &s;omewhat lower, we came to the Ruins of a Town, hear unto which, on the &s;ide of the Hill we ob&s;erved a curious Fountain, run|ning down thence into the <HI>Thebane</HI> Lake.

This is that Hill, or Mountain, which <HI>Strabo</HI> de&s;cribes by the name <HI>Phoenicius,</HI> and <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> by the name of <HI>Sphingis mons.</HI> On the top of it is a good large Plain which lyeth de&s;art; rather, as I judge, for want of Cultivation than of fertility. Thence after Dinner, and an hours further riding, we de&s;cended by the Covent <HI>Mazaraci</HI> into the Plain of <HI>Thebes,</HI> leaving a ruined Village about a Mile Ea&s;tward of <HI>Mazaraci.</HI> We might &s;oon have cro&s;&s;ed over this end of
<PB N="470" REF="204">the Plain, it being narrow, had not the Water after the Rains &s;etled there, and made the ground &s;o fal&s;e and rotten, that we feared almo&s;t every &s;tep to be &s;wallowed up both Hor&s;e and Man together; to pre|vent which we went afoot our &s;elves. But having, by Gods help, e&s;ca|ped that danger, and cro&s;&s;ed the way from <HI>Thebes</HI> to <HI>Livadia,</HI> we a&s;cen|ded again another Hill, bounding the Plain of <HI>Thebes,</HI> from the Plain of <HI>Rimoca&s;tri</HI> Southwards, and came to <HI>Rimoca&s;tri</HI> on the other &s;ide of it, an hour before Night.</P>
<P>I made a &s;top on the top of this Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">RIMOCA|STRI.</NOTE> and &s;urveighed the Country about me. For thence I had the &s;ight of a great part of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> that I had not before &s;een: e&s;pecially the Plain of <HI>Rimoca&s;tri.</HI> But tho&s;e parts I left behind, I ob&s;erved to lie thus. The Mountain by <HI>Thalanda</HI> North North-We&s;t. The Pa&s;&s;age between the Mountains from <HI>Cocino</HI> and the re&s;t of <HI>Ptoos,</HI> North-Ea&s;t by North. A Mountain towards <HI>Egripo,</HI> I think <HI>Typo-Vouni,</HI> Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t. <HI>Cha&s;ha,</HI> or <HI>Parnes,</HI> Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t. <HI>Elatea,</HI> or <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> beginneth South-Ea&s;t, and de&s;cendeth &s;omewhat upon the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph; to wit on the Bay of that Gulph, called now <HI>Liva|do&s;tro,</HI> South, South-We&s;t. Whence ari&s;eth a high Rock, off from it, and <HI>Helicon</HI> We&s;t, South-We&s;t. The top of the <HI>Helicon</HI> appears hence, We&s;t by North, being the neare&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Rimoca&s;tri</HI> is &s;ituated upon the Brow of this Hill, over-looking a large Plain South, and hath an unlimited pro&s;pect towards the <HI>Morea,</HI> between <HI>Helicon</HI> and <HI>Cithaeron.</HI> It is divided into three little knots of Hou&s;es, two upon the Hill, and one below: which may in all con&s;i&s;t of about a hun|dred Cottages of <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Albane&s;es:</HI> all Chri&s;tians except a <HI>Sub-Ba&s;ha</HI> that governs them, who is a <HI>Turk.</HI> That part of the Town which &s;tands upon the point of the Brow, &s;eemeth to have been in former times forti|fied with a Ditch on the North-&s;ide: on the other, the Precipice of the Hill is its defence; though at pre&s;ent needle&s;s: their Poverty being &s;ecu|rity enough for them. Here it is that I drank the be&s;t Wine, the mo&s;t generous and well ta&s;ted that I had done in all <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>In this Plain are many ancient Ruins of Towns, and about this place, and ju&s;t under the Mountain, are &s;o many and great Ruins, that it hath made &s;ome to &s;uppo&s;e this place to have been the ancient <HI>The&s;pia:</HI> But I am not of their opinion. I think rather it was the ancient <HI>Thisba,</HI> as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion by and by again more expre&s;ly to conclude, &s;hewing by mo&s;t probable Te&s;timony, where the old <HI>The&s;pia</HI> was. Here I met with <HI>Morat</HI> our Druggerman; who brought me news, that he had &s;een my Companion &s;afely Embarked. Whereupon taking Hor&s;e the next day I made a Circuit about the Plain, bending my cour&s;e We&s;twards, under the Hill; and after about a Mile we came to &s;ome Ruins, and old decay|ed Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PHRIA.</NOTE> called <HI>Phria:</HI> where we al&s;o found &s;ome In&s;criptions; e&s;|pecially one, which was a Pede&s;tal, dedicated by the Town to one <HI>Titus Flavius Ari&s;tus.</HI> About a Mile further riding, we came to another ruin|ated Town called <HI>Spatharia;</HI> the Church whereof, ruinated in like man|ner with the Town, &s;eem'd to have been built at fir&s;t of ancient, ill car|ved Marbles, with <HI>Ba&s;&s;o-relievoes</HI> of the &s;ame, of men on Hor&s;e-back, with their names, and
&EEgr;&Rgr;&OHgr;&EEgr;
for title to each one of them. Thence turning more South-We&s;twards, we pa&s;&s;ed over by a Stone-Bridge, a River coming from the <HI>Helicon,</HI> and running Ea&s;twards in this Plain, and
<PB N="471" REF="204">about two Miles further came to a Village called <HI>Neocoria,</HI> or <HI>New-town;</HI> ju&s;t at the foot of the Mountain <HI>Zagara,</HI> or <HI>Helicon:</HI> hard by which are the Ruins of an ancient City, upon a Hill, with a &s;teep de&s;cent from it every way except on that &s;ide where it is joined to the high Mountain above it. In the way going up to it is a ruined Church; which hath for the <HI>Altar</HI> a Corni&s;h of a Pede&s;tal of a Statue, about four foot long, and three foot large, and a foot thick: on the edge of which is an ancient In&s;cription, wherein the Town <HI>The&s;pia</HI> is twice mentioned.</P>

<P>Whence, becau&s;e it likewi&s;e agrees with the De&s;cription <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> gives of it, I doubt not, but this was the Seat of the ancient <HI>The&s;pia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">THESPIA.</NOTE> It is about four Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Rimoca&s;tri</HI> We&s;twards, and five or &s;ix from <HI>Cacos,</HI> a Town &s;eated in one of the Bayes of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, called now <HI>Livado&s;tro.</HI> Thence we turned South-Ea&s;t-wards, and after two or three Miles riding over a little Hill, we came to other Ruins of a Town called <HI>Palaeo-corio,</HI> or <HI>Old Town;</HI> where we likewi&s;e found &s;ome In&s;criptions, but le&s;s con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Thence returning Ea&s;twards we pa&s;&s;ed by another little Village called <HI>Tadza,</HI> where are &s;ome marks of Antiquity; and by it a curious Foun|tain, which I gue&s;s to be that which was &s;o celebrated in old times for the Fable of <HI>Narci&s;&s;us:</HI> and if &s;o, the Town &s;hould have been called <HI>Do|nacon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pau&s;.</HI> Lib. 3. p. 589.</NOTE> or <HI>Hedonacon</HI> as &s;ome read it. I &s;aw no <HI>Narci&s;&s;us</HI> then growing, it being yet too early in the Year. But another time I &s;aw abundance in the next Plain, and &s;everal other places adjacent. Yet what <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith of this Fountain agreeth with &s;everal other places in this Plain; e&s;|pecially <HI>Rimoca&s;tri;</HI> where there are many Springs up and down the Plain: which collecting them&s;elves into &s;treams, &s;ome run towards the <HI>Theban</HI> Lake, and others to the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph. That which runs to|wards <HI>Thebes, &s;tagnates</HI> into a Lake, Ea&s;twards of <HI>Rimoca&s;tri,</HI> as I &s;aw at two or three Miles di&s;tance. We returned by the Ruins under <HI>Rimo|ca&s;tri,</HI> which they call now only <HI>Castri,</HI> where there are many Ruined Churches, with Fragments of In&s;criptions about them. Among&s;t which I found a Stone in the Wall, where I read
&Pgr;&Rgr;&Agr;&Xgr;&Igr;&Tgr;&Igr;&Lgr;&EEgr;&Sgr; &Agr;&THgr;&EEgr;&Ngr;&Agr;,
which whether it was belonging to &s;ome piece of that famous Sculpture, I will not take upon me to know. Only this I can &s;ay, that <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> gives an account of an Image of <HI>Cupid,</HI> of his work, adored and much admi|red by the <HI>The&s;pians:</HI> in who&s;e Territories not only this place was, but al&s;o the whole Plain. As to the ancient names of this, and the re&s;t of the Ruined Towns I &s;aw there, I found not &s;ufficient ground for me to determine any thing here; yet by <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> his De&s;cription, this &s;hould be <HI>Thisba</HI> of the ancients; which he placeth off from the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THISEA.</NOTE> after two Mountains in a Vally. For &s;o many Hills, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> often magni|fied into Mountains, are between it and the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, and be|tween tho&s;e two Hills another &s;mall Plain.</P>
<P>When I had thus far cro&s;&s;ed the Country, I had a great mind to con|tinue
<PB N="472" REF="205">&s;till forward, until I came to the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, that I might have a fuller <HI>Idaea</HI> of it. But I had much ado to per&s;wade my Drugger|man to it: who pretended it to be dangerous by rea&s;on of Thieves and Pirates. But by means of a Dollar extraordinary I accompli&s;hed my de|&s;ign, and per&s;waded our Ho&s;t to accompany us al&s;o. We pa&s;&s;ed over the Plain of <HI>Rimoca&s;tri</HI> South-We&s;twards, and mounted a Hill, which &s;epa|rates it from another little Plain, bounded by Mount <HI>Cithaeron.</HI> From this Plain we yet further de&s;cended along the <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> by a bad way We&s;twards to the Bay of <HI>Livado&s;tro;</HI> along by a &s;tream, which often lo&s;eth it &s;elf among the Sand and Stones in its Chanel, before it can get to the Sea. There is no Town, nor Inhabitants there; only an old Tower, and a little Church for the Mariners to do their Devotions in, who come thither to lade Corn for <HI>Zant, Cephalonia,</HI> and tho&s;e other parts. In our way we fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by a little Village called <HI>Sta dendra,</HI> or <HI>The Trees;</HI> and then another called <HI>Parapagia:</HI> where I found &s;ome In&s;criptions in an old Church, near unto a Fountaia. This place, I believe, was anci|ently called <HI>Leuctra.</HI> For that was in the way from <HI>The&s;pia</HI> to <HI>Plataea,</HI> as this mu&s;t needs be. This Port is in a large Bay at the end of the <HI>Corin|thian</HI> Gulph: which I find no where mention'd in the modern Maps. The rea&s;on of which, as I gue&s;s, may be &s;everal mi&s;takes the Interpreters and Commentators have made upon <HI>Strabo:</HI> of which I may have occa|&s;ion to &s;peak &s;omething, before I end this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>This Bay is divided from the Bay of <HI>Corinth</HI> by the Mountain <HI>Gera|nia,</HI> or <HI>Palaeo-Vouni,</HI> in the <HI>&s;thmus,</HI> which running out far into the <HI>Co|rinthian</HI> Gulph,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Strab.</HI> Lib. 8.380.</NOTE> makes a Promontory, which <HI>Strabo</HI> plainly calls <HI>Olmeae Promontorium:</HI> on the North&s;ide of which this Bay of <HI>Livadostro</HI> lyeth, and thence goeth far inward, until it is bounded by the &s;hore of <HI>Megaris</HI> fir&s;t, and then by the &s;hore of <HI>Eleutherus,</HI> whence it turneth about, and hath &s;ome part of the high Mountain <HI>Elatea,</HI> or <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> over-looking it North; until it comes almo&s;t to the Harbour of <HI>Livado&s;tro.</HI> Where <HI>Ela|tea</HI> endeth, is another Harbour, called <HI>Santo Ba&s;ilio,</HI> from a Ruined Town two or three Miles above it: whence ari&s;eth another Ridge of high Rocks, but not con&s;iderable for height if compared with <HI>Elatea;</HI> beyond which is the Harbour of <HI>Livado&s;tro:</HI> and then again ri&s;eth ano|ther very high Rock, running a good way into the Sea: Beyond which is al&s;o another Harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CACOS.</NOTE> and Town called <HI>Cacos:</HI> and thence the <HI>Helicon</HI> begins to lift up its head, till at la&s;t it reacheth even above the Clouds. From <HI>Livado&s;tro</HI> we turned to the left hand along the &s;hore, about a Mile further, and came to the Harbour of <HI>Sant Ba&s;ilio;</HI> whence the Promontory <HI>Olmea</HI> lyeth We&s;t-South-We&s;t, with four little I&s;lands by it, called <HI>Calani&s;ia,</HI> or the <HI>good I&s;lands.</HI> In one of them is a little Church, and a Well, as the <HI>Abbane&s;es</HI> told me, full of a kind of Serpents, which are not at all venemous nor hurtful; which I believe, if they be of the &s;ame nature with one I found on the Sea &s;hore here, <HI>viz.</HI> petrified.</P>
<P>This Bay did not want a name among the ancients, although neglect|ed by our modern Geographers, as may be collected out of <HI>Strabo</HI> his eighth and ninth Books,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 39, 40.</NOTE> being by him called <HI>Alcyonum mare:</HI> which was, as he &s;aid, extended from <HI>Paga,</HI> a Port Town of <HI>Megaris,</HI> in the way from <HI>Megara</HI> to <HI>Boeotia</HI> unto <HI>Creu&s;a,</HI> the Port-Town of the <HI>The&s;pians.</HI> But I will take the Learned <HI>Ca&s;uubons</HI> warning, which he gives in his Com|mentary
<PB N="473" REF="205">upon this place; namely not to take it to be the &s;ole <HI>Alcyonuma mare.</HI> For that, as to the generality of the name, was extended much further, even to <HI>Antirrhium,</HI> or the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto:</HI> But, by his leave, will e&s;teem this to have been more peculiarly &s;o cal|led; that being, certainly, mo&s;t properly the <HI>Alcyonum &s;inus,</HI> or <HI>mare,</HI> which extended it &s;elf from <HI>Pegas</HI> to <HI>Creu&s;a:</HI> Which <HI>Creu&s;a</HI> mu&s;t un|doubtedly have been either where <HI>Cacos</HI> or <HI>Livado&s;tro</HI> now are. I judge rather the fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is nearer to <HI>The&s;pia</HI> than <HI>Livado&s;tro.</HI> But <HI>Liva|do&s;tro</HI> is nearer <HI>Rimoca&s;tri;</HI> where I &s;uppo&s;e the ancient <HI>Thisba</HI> was: and therefore that may be its Harbour, &s;o well &s;tored with Pidgeons as they &s;ay it was; and whence to <HI>Sicyon</HI> was a hundred and &s;ixty <HI>Stadia,</HI> or twenty Miles, over the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph; and as he &s;aith, in <HI>an oblique line:</HI> of which the high Rock between this and <HI>Cacos</HI> makes one Crook, and the <HI>Olmaea</HI> Promontory another. The Harbour of S^t <HI>Ba&s;ilio</HI> was, very probably, that which belonged to the ancient <HI>Typha;</HI> who valued them&s;elves much for being the be&s;t Seamen of all <HI>Boeotia.</HI> At this place we lay all Night under the &s;hade of a Pine-Tree; with which the Rocks there are covered.</P>
<P>Longer than next Morning we &s;taid not in this cold Harbour; but leaving the Hill, and way on the other &s;ide of it to <HI>Rimoca&s;tri</HI> on the left hand, we turned on the right, by the way that leads thence to <HI>Thebes,</HI> near the foot of Mount <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> now called <HI>Elatea:</HI> who&s;e high Ridge we had above us &s;till on the right hand: having thus mounted at lea&s;t an hour, till we came about, level with the Plain of <HI>Rimoca&s;tri,</HI> we came at la&s;t to <HI>Sant Ba&s;ilio</HI> it &s;elf, a Town utterly ruined not long &s;ince by Pi|rates. But be&s;ide the modern <HI>Remains</HI> of it, there are Re&s;ts al&s;o of ma|ny Ages pa&s;t. There is an old Church, with a <HI>Cupolo</HI> &s;u&s;tained by <HI>Corin|thian</HI> Pillars of admirable white Marble, and curious work. Hard by it is a Well of pure Water, deep, but filled to the brim. Above this lyeth the Town, on a Hillock, higher than the re&s;t: which is full of Ruins al&s;o. Between the Town and the oppo&s;ite Hill, North-wards, in a deep furrow runneth a con&s;iderable &s;tream; which in &s;ight of the Town makes a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Ca&s;cade. This in all likely hood is the ancient <HI>Typha</HI> I be|fore mentioned; and tho&s;e beautiful Pillars of the ruin'd Church may have al&s;o &s;erved for the Temple of <HI>Hercules</HI> at <HI>Typha.</HI></P>
<P>Continuing forward on our way, under the Mount <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> or <HI>Ela|tea,</HI> we came to another ruined City, at the foot of it, &s;ituate &s;o, as it hath a de&s;cent every way from it, except towards the Mountain, South-We&s;t: where the ground &s;eemeth level for near a Mile, to a Village cal|led <HI>Cocla:</HI> but the&s;e Ruins are called <HI>Palaeo-castro,</HI> or <HI>Old-Ca&s;tle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">COCLA.</NOTE> as they call almo&s;t all &s;uch old Ruins. On the North-We&s;t &s;ide of it I ob&s;erved a curious Fountain; which &s;eemeth to run into that &s;tream, that falleth into the Bay of <HI>Livado&s;tro,</HI> by <HI>Sant Ba&s;ilio.</HI> The Foundations of the ancient Walls that remain, are of large hewen Stone, and at equal di|&s;tances were crowned with &s;quare Towers: &s;ome of which are yet &s;tanding. It over-looketh a large Plain Northwards, well water'd with &s;treams from the Mountains, and undoubtedly very fruitful. It hath North the Mountain <HI>Mezaraci,</HI> or <HI>Phoenicius; Rimoca&s;tri</HI> North-North-We&s;t: A Tower and Village on the point of a Rock, over-looking the Plain of <HI>Livadia,</HI> near <HI>Zagara,</HI> or <HI>Helicon</HI> North-We&s;t, that part of the
<PB N="474" REF="206"><HI>Helicon</HI> where <HI>Neocorio,</HI> or old <HI>The&s;pia</HI> &s;tands, North-We&s;t by We&s;t. The largene&s;s of it &s;hews it to have been a con&s;iderable place; and the fragments of Antiquity, that are to be &s;een all about it, to have been very ancient. It agrees with the De&s;cription that the ancients give both of <HI>Hirria,</HI> called afterward <HI>Hy&s;&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Plataea;</HI> to wit, being both un|der the Mountain <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> at the right hand of the way, that leads from <HI>Thebes</HI> into <HI>Attica, Eleutherus,</HI> and <HI>Argos</HI> upon the River <HI>A&s;&s;opus.</HI> But as for this la&s;t mark, I am at a &s;tand how to judge. For there is indeed a little &s;tream under this in the Plain: But it runs &s;o &s;low, that I could not well determine which way it did run. But I judged, it might run into the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto</HI> by <HI>Sant Ba&s;ilio.</HI> But whether &s;ome part of it runs not al&s;o towards the <HI>Euripus</HI> by rea&s;on of the level of the Plain, I cannot po&s;itively determine: e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that not very far from hence we cro&s;s'd a &s;tream that run from this Way-wards thither, as I before have &s;hewed, and is undoubtedly the <HI>A&s;opus. Hirria,</HI> or <HI>Hy&s;&s;ia,</HI> being but a &s;mall Town, and <HI>Plataea</HI> a large City, and &s;ometimes a <HI>Free State</HI> of it &s;elf, I rather believe this was the <HI>Plataea;</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;&s;ia</HI> another place I pa&s;t by a little further off, nearer the way into <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Megara.</HI> The Plain under this Mountain undoubtedly was the Plain of <HI>Plataea,</HI> famous for the Battle and Victory of the <HI>Greeks</HI> over the <HI>Per&s;ians, Mardonius</HI> being then General of <HI>Xerxes</HI> his Army.</P>
<P>Hence proceeding about a Mile we endeavoured to get over the Mountain; but finding no Tract in the Snow, and that it was too deep to be pa&s;&s;ed over, we left that way, and de&s;cending again into the Plain, we went further Ea&s;twards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIGADIA.</NOTE> and came to a &s;mall Village called <HI>Pigadia;</HI> whence, having &s;tayed and refre&s;hed our &s;elves, we took Hor&s;e, and made again towards the Mountain, quickly gaining the way from <HI>Thebes</HI> into the <HI>Morea;</HI> and afterwards that from <HI>Egripo</HI> thither al&s;o: where we again went up the <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> or <HI>Elatea,</HI> as it is now vulgarly called, from the abundance of <HI>Firr Trees</HI> growing thereon, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;till call <GAP DESC="foreign">. We a&s;cended it by the way now called <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>The way of the Vizire;</HI> for it was he commanded it to be opened, made &s;mooth, and covered with Sand, when he pa&s;&s;ed that way with his Army into the <HI>Morea,</HI> and thence into <HI>Candia,</HI> at the beginning of that War. We arrived to the top from the foot in an hours time, and de&s;cended as &s;oon into a Valley, between <HI>Cithaeron</HI> and the Mountain called now <HI>Ma|criplais.</HI> This Valley belonged in very ancient times to the <HI>Eleutherians;</HI> who being &s;ubject to tho&s;e of <HI>Thebes,</HI> out of an inveterated hatred and emulation revolted from them and join'd them&s;elves to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> as was pretended out of a great fancy and good affection they took to their way of Government. From thence forward this Mount <HI>Cithaeron</HI> was accounted the Confines of <HI>Attica</HI> towards <HI>Boeotia:</HI> whereas before the <HI>Eleutherians</HI> were the Borderers of <HI>Boeotia</HI> towards <HI>Attica.</HI> This Val|ley I find no where de&s;crib'd by our modern <HI>Geographers;</HI> from which only their ignorance of it can excu&s;e them. For neither for its Barren|ne&s;s, nor its &s;mallne&s;s, could it merit their neglect. For I believe it wants not much of being as big as the Plain of <HI>Eleu&s;is:</HI> I am &s;ure it is as long, or longer, and wants little of being as large from the foot of Mount <HI>E|latea</HI> to <HI>Macriplais,</HI> parting it from the Plains of <HI>Eleu&s;is</HI> and <HI>Megaris</HI> Southwards. There is one &s;tream here that runneth down into the <HI>Co|rinthian</HI>

<P>Where the ancient City <HI>Eleutherus</HI> was, I could no where find; though <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, the ruins of it were towards the foot of Mount <HI>Cithaeron</HI> in his time.

Under this Moun|tain therefore is fir&s;t the Plain of <HI>Platea;</HI> North of that the Plain of <HI>The&s;pia,</HI> divided from <HI>Platea</HI> by one or two Ridges of Hills, coming from that Hill which is between the <HI>Helicon</HI> and <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> or between <HI>Liva|do&s;tro</HI> and <HI>Cacos.</HI> Beyond this are the Plains of <HI>Livadia</HI> and <HI>Thebes;</HI> both of them bounded from <HI>The&s;pia,</HI> by a Ridge coming from the <HI>Helicon;</HI> which pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Panagia,</HI> and <HI>Rimoca&s;tri, &amp;c.</HI> reacheth almo&s;t to <HI>Thebes.</HI> The Plains of <HI>Livadia</HI> and <HI>Thebes</HI> are &s;eparated from each other by the Moun|tain <HI>Phaenicius</HI> or <HI>Sphinx.</HI> Beyond <HI>Thebes</HI> North-Ea&s;t is the <HI>Campus Ionius,</HI> under Mount <HI>Hypatus,</HI> and <HI>Campus Tanagricus</HI> South of it.

<P>When I had taken my fill of this pro&s;pect we de&s;cended again into the Plain, pa&s;&s;ing by the Ruins of <HI>Hy&s;&s;ia,</HI> near the foot of the Moun|tain, about a Mile further by <HI>Plataea:</HI> and a little further down into the Plain we &s;taid to bait, near the &s;mall &s;tream I before mention'd: where I now ob&s;erved abundance of <HI>Narci&s;&s;us</HI> growing along its Banks; and &s;hot a <HI>Lapwing</HI> or <HI>Pewit,</HI> with &s;harp Spurs on the Wings, as <HI>Cocks</HI> and <HI>Phea&s;ants</HI> have on their Legs: of which I ob&s;erved &s;omething at <HI>Smyrna</HI> on Ducks.

<P>The next day we parted from <HI>Rimocastri,</HI> keeping along the Hill it &s;tands on, towards <HI>Livadia,</HI> and came to an old Ruined Tower, with the remains of a Town about it, &s;eated upon a high point of a Rock, part of &s;ome Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PANAGIA.</NOTE> called now only <HI>Panagia:</HI> which is the &s;ame, that I &s;aid lay North-We&s;t from the Pa&s;&s;age over Mount <HI>Cithaeron.</HI> It over-looketh the Plain of <HI>The&s;pia</HI> South, and the Plain of <HI>Livadia</HI> North; and is not above a Mile from <HI>Neo-coria,</HI> or <HI>The&s;pia</HI> South. Between both is a little Valley, which hath a &s;tream running thorough it, by the Plain of <HI>The&s;pia,</HI> into the Gulph or Bay of <HI>Livado&s;tro.</HI> This I &s;uppo&s;e was the River <HI>Ter|me&s;&s;us;</HI> which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith, <HI>floweth about the Helicon,</HI> as this doth a good part of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CERESSUS.</NOTE> This place is al&s;o mo&s;t likely to be that <HI>Cere&s;&s;us</HI> he &s;peaks of, &s;aying, it was a <HI>very strong castle of the The&s;pians,</HI> and whither they fled upon every occa&s;ion when they fear'd the coming of the <HI>The|bans</HI> among&s;t them. Here in &s;everal Ruined Churches I met with &s;ome In|&s;criptions: one e&s;pecially of &s;uch odd Characters, and different from the ordinary, that I cannot but que&s;tion whether it were &s;o very ancient or no. Another upon half a large Pede&s;tal of a Statue: of which In&s;crip|tion I was able to read &s;o much, as &s;hewed it to have been dedicated to the Emperour <HI>Commodus.</HI></P>
<P>Here I was overtaken by a Me&s;&s;enger from the Engli&s;h <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> to let me know, there was an Engli&s;h Ship arrived thither; whereby I might have convenience to &s;end my Marbles, and whatever I would el&s;e, into <HI>England:</HI> which al&s;o in its return was to touch at <HI>Zant,</HI> whither I was bound. The&s;e Letters invited me very earne&s;tly to return again thi|ther. But I was not willing to go &s;o far back again; thinking it more &s;afe to go by Boat to <HI>Zant,</HI> the &s;ame way I came; we having then War with <HI>Tripoli,</HI> and the Ship at <HI>Athens</HI> had no Convoy to guard it. There|fore I &s;ent back directions for what other Marbles I would have to be &s;ent by the Ship, and kept on my Journey; but fir&s;t return'd to <HI>Rimo|ca&s;tri.</HI></P>
<P>After Dinner I parted again from <HI>Rimoca&s;tri,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed along that Hill towards the Plain of <HI>Livadia,</HI> leaving the way to <HI>Panagia</HI> on our left hand: not far beyond which I pa&s;&s;ed over a Torrent, coming down from the <HI>Helicon</HI> with a great Stream: and near where I pa&s;&s;ed it, I ob|&s;erv'd &s;everal Springs, with very plentiful Sources of Water. This may be that Stream which was anciently called <HI>Perme&s;&s;us;</HI> which de&s;cended from the <HI>Helicon,</HI> and together with <HI>Olmeus</HI> falls into the Lake <HI>Copais,</HI> by <HI>Haliartus,</HI> as <HI>Strabo,</HI> in his Ninth Book informs us. After I had forded this Stream, I pa&s;s'd over the Hill into the Plain of <HI>Livadia:</HI> where lea|ving
<PB N="477" REF="207"><HI>Megalom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lci</HI> about three Miles on our right hand, we came that E|vening to a &s;mall Village of the <HI>Albane&s;es,</HI> on the &s;ide of it, where we Lodged all Night. Thence, this Hill turning South We&s;twards towards the <HI>Helicon,</HI> and joining with it enlargeth the Plain of <HI>Livadia,</HI> to the foot of that Mountain: whence it is again &s;treightened by another lit|tle Mountain, &s;tretched out towards <HI>Livadia:</HI> So that were this whole Plain filled with Water, this would be a con&s;iderable Bay of the Lake <HI>Livadia:</HI> This I judge to be the chief part of the Plain, called from the City <HI>Coronaea, Coronaei ager;</HI> which City without doubt was &s;ituated in &s;ome eminent place of this Plain near the <HI>Helicon:</HI> But where, I am not certain. I &s;uppo&s;e it was either at S^t <HI>Georgio,</HI> which is at the foot of the <HI>Helicon,</HI> or at certain Ruins of a Tower I pa&s;&s;ed by the next day, going that way, or at lea&s;t at the Ruins of <HI>Dyminia,</HI> in the way from <HI>Livadia</HI> to <HI>Thebes.</HI> As to the nearne&s;s to the <HI>Helicon,</HI> S^t <HI>Georgio</HI> &s;eemeth to agree better with it than either <HI>Dyminia,</HI> or that Tower between them. But the Stream, which &s;hould be <HI>Coralius,</HI> ri&s;ing at <HI>Dyminia,</HI> &s;hews it rather to be there that it was &s;ituated. The forty <HI>Stadia,</HI> or five Miles, from Mount <HI>Libethrius,</HI> and twenty <HI>Stadia,</HI> or two Miles and a half, from <HI>Laphytius,</HI> &s;eem to &s;hew, that <HI>Libethrius</HI> Mountain was that to|wards <HI>Panagia</HI> and <HI>Rimoca&s;tri;</HI> and that one of tho&s;e towards <HI>Livadia,</HI> was <HI>Laphytius.</HI> But whether that agrees be&s;t to <HI>Dyminia,</HI> the <HI>Tower,</HI> or S^t <HI>Georgio,</HI> I cannot well determine. And indeed the De&s;criptions of the ancients are &s;o defective for want of a&s;&s;igning the quarters of the Hea|vens to them, that it is very hard for us that come &s;o long after them, to determine po&s;itively the true &s;ituation of their places: and &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If <HI>Dyminia</HI> was formerly <HI>Coronea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">MINERVA ITONIA.</NOTE> then the Ruined Tower may have been the place where the Temple of <HI>Minerva Itonia</HI> &s;ometimes &s;tood: which was the place where all <HI>Boeotia</HI> u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble in Council.</P>
<P>Thence coming nearer to the foot of the <HI>Helicon,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect into a little Plain, inclo&s;ed every way with prominent parts of the Mountain; except one narrow Pa&s;&s;age for entrance to it like to a Sea-Port. Hence we &s;oon mounted up to S^t <HI>Georgio,</HI> &s;ituate on the &s;ide of <HI>Helicon,</HI> having left a Village below it on the right hand. Either S^t <HI>Georgio,</HI> or this Village was probably the <HI>Alalcontenae</HI> of old time. This Town is called <GAP DESC="foreign">, or S^t <HI>George,</HI> from a Mona&s;tery there dedicated to him. There are two or three Churches here in which are &s;ome In&s;criptions of Antiquity: But I could not &s;ee them, becau&s;e my Guide was afraid of the Turks; and my <HI>Druggerman</HI> was re|turn'd to <HI>Athens,</HI> to give the Con&s;ul an account of my Re&s;olutions to proceed on my Voyage to <HI>Zant.</HI> So we &s;taid not long in this place, but mounted up a con&s;iderable way higher, toward the top of the <HI>Helicon;</HI> with intentions to pa&s;s quite over it, unto the Convent of <HI>Saint Luke:</HI> But we were hindred by the Snow; which was not yet pa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>This Mountain is now called <HI>Zagara</HI> by the Turks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. ZAGARA the HELICON.</NOTE> from the great abundance of Hares they &s;ay breed there; although there be plenty of other Game al&s;o, e&s;pecially Wild Boars and Dear: But it is known out of <HI>Strabo</HI> undoubtedly to be that famous <HI>Helicon</HI> of the ancients. For, agreeable to his De&s;cription, it lyeth upon the <HI>Cri&s;&s;ean,</HI> or <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, bordering upon <HI>Phocis;</HI> which it regards Northward, &s;omewhat
<PB N="478" REF="208">inclining to the We&s;t. And as the &s;aith, its high Cliffs hang over the la&s;t Harbour of <HI>Phocis;</HI> which was therefore called <HI>Mycus:</HI> nor is it not far di&s;tant from <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> nor inferiour to it, either in height, or the com|pa&s;s of ground that it &s;tands on. Finally, that they are both Rocky Mountains, and the tops of them perpetually covered with Snow. Mount <HI>Helicon</HI> was in old times con&s;ecrated to the Mu&s;es by the <HI>Thracians;</HI> and was the native Country of the ancient Poet <HI>He&s;iod,</HI> who was born at <HI>A&s;|cra,</HI> an inho&s;pitable Town on the &s;ide of it towards the Sea; whom <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;eems to follow and imitate, but with more briskne&s;s and le&s;s gravity. <HI>He&s;iod</HI> &s;eems with more re&s;pect to celebrate the Gods, as it became his per&s;wa&s;ion of them, and with more earne&s;tne&s;s to pre&s;s men to Ju&s;tice, Vertue and Humanity: which is as much to be preferred before the others bawdy and lying &s;tories of them, as all Moral and Chri&s;tian Ver|tues infinitely tran&s;cend the ob&s;cene Lampoons of our pre&s;ent Age, being really more beautiful and attracting Objects than any Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in the World. I found not tho&s;e Monuments, either of <HI>He&s;iod, Orpheus,</HI> or <HI>the Mu&s;es, Pau&s;anias</HI> in his time profe&s;&s;eth to have &s;een there: And as to the Fountain <HI>Hippocrene,</HI> the famous haunt of the nine Si&s;ters, it was then frozen up, if it were where I gue&s;s'd it to have been. So that were I a Poet, and never &s;o great a Votary of tho&s;e <HI>Heliconian Deities,</HI> I might be excu&s;ed from making Ver&s;es in their prai&s;e, having neither their pre|&s;ence to excite, nor their liquor to in&s;pire me. For having gone two or three Miles forwards on the top, till I came to the Snow, my further proceedings that way were hindred; only alighting I made &s;hift to clam|ber up the Rocks &s;omewhat higher, until I came to look down into a place encompa&s;&s;ed round with the tops of Mountains; &s;o that the inclo|&s;ed &s;pace &s;eemed to me to be a Lake frozen, and covered with Snow. But my Guide telling me be pa&s;&s;ed that way once in the Summer time with <HI>Mon&s;ieur Nantueil,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, and then &s;aw it a very plea&s;ant green Valley, covered with Flowers, having a very good Foun|tain in the middle of it; I am much inclin'd to think the <HI>Hippocrene</HI> was there, and there al&s;o in antient times the delicious Grove of the Mu&s;es.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved likewi&s;e great &s;tore of the <HI>Male-Fir-Tree</HI> growing on this Mountain; who&s;e Turpentine is very fragrant, much re&s;embling the &s;mell of a Nutmeg, and &s;ome of that <HI>Leopards-bane,</HI> who&s;e root is like a Scorpion. But her partly the cold of a backward Spring, and partly the time of Year, hindred me from making any further di&s;coveries in that kind. I &s;hall only tell you what <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> telleth me, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is one kind of an <HI>Arbutus,</HI> or Strawberry-Tree, beareth &s;weeter fruit here than in any other place he knows: which may well be, although I took no notice of any there. I &s;aw here al&s;o a very large Tortoi&s;e, newly come out of ground, to enjoy the warm Sun; and of which they &s;ay there is great plenty bred there.</P>
<P>We return'd to the brow of the Mountain by the &s;ame way we came, and thence I had a fair and large Pro&s;pect of the Plains of <HI>Boeotia</HI> North|ward, and ob&s;erved the Mountain <HI>Delphi</HI> of <HI>Egripo</HI> to lie exactly Ea&s;t of us, and another of the &s;ame I&s;land to lie Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t. We left the way to St. <HI>Georgio,</HI> and turning to our left hand, de&s;cended into a Plain, between the Mountain <HI>Helicon,</HI> and another little Mountain; the Ea&s;tern end of which comes up near to it, and the Town of St. <HI>George,</HI>
<PB N="479" REF="208">but thence runs North-We&s;twards, beyond <HI>Livadia,</HI> which it hath un|der it on the North-&s;ide. This Mountain from the Plain of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> &s;eems not at all di&s;tinct from the <HI>Helicon;</HI> although it hath a Plain between it, and that in &s;ome places I believe three or four Miles wide. On the top of it, on the Ea&s;t end, we &s;aw <HI>Granitza,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">GRANITZA.</NOTE> which I was told was a Town and Bi&s;hoprick under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Athens.</HI> Here is al&s;o a Convent of <HI>Caloires,</HI> or <HI>Greeki&s;h</HI> Monks: which is all I could learn of the place; only from the ancients I gather that this Mountain was cal|led by two di&s;tinct names; to wit, <HI>Laphytius</HI> on this end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LAPHYTIUS and TELPHY|SIUM, mm.</NOTE> and <HI>Telphy&s;ium</HI> on the We&s;tern. In de&s;cending we turned &s;till round the <HI>Helicon</HI> to our left hand; and in our way pa&s;&s;ed by many Fountains that i&s;&s;ue out of the &s;ides of that Mountain; &s;ome of which run down into the Plain of <HI>Livadia,</HI> as far as the Lake, into which they flow: others collect them|&s;elves into a Stream in this Valley, One makes a fine Ca&s;cade almo&s;t from the top of the Mountain, and I believe runneth from the Lake, I before &s;pake of, on the top of the <HI>Helicon,</HI> by its nearne&s;s to that place. There was abundance of the <HI>Narci&s;&s;us</HI> Flowers growing along the Banks of this Stream, &s;o <HI>proliferous,</HI> that I had not before &s;een any the like; having &s;even, eight, nine, &s;ometimes ten Flowers upon the &s;ame &s;talk, and very fragrant. Here my Guide proved to be near as ignorant and unacquain|ted in the Country as my &s;elf; and it growing towards Night, we knew not whither to go to Lodge. A Village we &s;aw two or three Miles high, on the Precipices of the <HI>Helicon;</HI> but how to get to it we knew not. At la&s;t, &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;tre&s;s we were in, and almo&s;t out of hopes of getting any &s;helter but the Heavens that Night; by the good Provi|dence of God we over-took two or three Oxen, which we followed as <HI>Cadmus</HI> did a Heifer, by direction of the Oracle to the Building of <HI>Thebes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ovid. Met. <HI>L. 3.</HI></NOTE> The&s;e brought us to a Shepherds Hutt; which we found to be too lit|tle to hold us and the Cattle together. But the Shepherd inform'd us, there was a Village about two Miles further, which having found with much ado, by that time it was dark, being &s;eated upon a little Hill, ju&s;t under the <HI>Helicon,</HI> we were received courteou&s;ly into the Hou&s;e of a good hone&s;t <HI>Albane&s;e,</HI> the only Inhabitant at pre&s;ent of the place, the re&s;t of the Inhabitants were all run away, not being able to pay their <HI>Ca|ratch.</HI> Here is an old Church, with &s;ome remains of Antiquity about it. But I cannot conjecture the ancient name of the place, unle&s;s it &s;hould have been <HI>Atalcomenae,</HI> which <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;eems to intimate, &s;peaking of the <HI>Telphy&s;ium mons,</HI> which he placeth between <HI>Halyartus, Atalcomenae,</HI> and <HI>Coronea. Halyartus</HI> was near the Lake <HI>Copais,</HI> and as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> reports, fifty <HI>Stadia,</HI> or &s;ix Miles, from this Mountain. But if this Village were the <HI>Atalcomenae</HI> of old, then the River that cometh this way out of the <HI>Helicon,</HI> &s;hould be that of <HI>Triton</HI> which pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Atalcomenae;</HI> and not the other ri&s;ing between <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Cyrphis,</HI> I before &s;poke of. All the entertainment we found here was the &s;ad &s;tories our Landlord told us of the Oppre&s;&s;ion they &s;uffer by their hard Ma&s;ters the Turks. My Guide made me take notice, that his Daughter did wear red Slippers, which was a &s;ign &s;he intended to be Married, when &s;he could get her a Hu&s;|band; which I gue&s;s &s;he could not long have wanted, had not the Town been &s;o much depopulated; for natural Beauty was &s;uch as might
<PB N="480" REF="209">make her de&s;erve the Court&s;hip of the brave&s;t Shepherd of the <HI>Boeotian</HI> Plains.</P>
<P>The next Morning we parted thence, and keeping &s;till under the <HI>He|licon</HI> on our left hand, in a very rotten, un&s;ound way: I ob&s;erved almo&s;t every &s;tep our Hor&s;es made, there &s;prung up a new <HI>Hippocrene;</HI> the fre&s;h Water following each print of my Hor&s;es feet; e&s;pecially at one place, where I was almo&s;t &s;tuck fa&s;t, although the &s;urface of the ground was covered with a green Sword. The&s;e Springs collect them&s;elves to|gether with the other River in this Valley, and I believe pa&s;s under ground to <HI>Livadia,</HI> and make the River <HI>Hercyna,</HI> when they ari&s;e there. For I know not which way otherwi&s;e they can pa&s;s: and the abundance of Water, which there ari&s;eth again, confirmeth me in that opinion. Here the <HI>Helicon</HI> makes an Elbow Northward, almo&s;t joining with that of <HI>Granitza</HI> and <HI>Livadia</HI> in the way, to which from <HI>Salona</HI> and <HI>Delphos</HI> we came in about half an hours further riding: So &s;oon as we were got into that way, we met with a <HI>Caratchi;</HI> a formidable Officer of the Turks among the Greeks, being the <HI>Grand Signiors</HI> Collector of Taxes. So con|tinuing &s;till our winding about the foot of this Mountain, and leaving the way to <HI>Delphos</HI> on our right hand, we arrived at the Convent of <HI>Saint Luca:</HI> of which and the Hermitage I &s;aw there, when we came fir&s;t into the&s;e parts, I have el&s;ewhere already given an account. So that I have only now to tell you of my return thence; and &s;o conclude.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the tenth I &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger from hence to the Port of <HI>A&s;pro&s;piti,</HI> to &s;ee whether any Barks lay there, bound for <HI>Zant:</HI> and word being brought me that there were two, I prevailed with the <HI>Egoumeno</HI> of the Convent, to let <HI>Pappa Carito,</HI> one of the <HI>Religious men,</HI> accompany me thither. So after Dinner I parted thence, and pa&s;&s;ed over the Plain be|tween <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Helicon,</HI> by the way to <HI>Delphos;</HI> which I left, after an hour and halfs riding, on the right hand, and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>A&s;pro&s;piti</HI> in the Evening, we came to Bay of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, called by the &s;ame name, by that time it was dark.</P>
<P>The next Morning we Embarked in the Calm, but were met pre&s;ently with a contrary Wind and &s;udden &s;torm in the middle of the Bay: So that not without much danger, we were forced to return again into the &s;ame Port. It was a &s;trange and almo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ight for us to &s;ee the Storm come upon us at three or four Miles di&s;tance, while we were be|calm'd, yet on the &s;udden to fall on us with &s;uch a fury, as if it would immediately &s;wallow us up, being accompanied with &s;uch a prodigious Rain and Hail, as we fear'd would fill all the vacant places in the Bark, that the Wheat, wherewith it was full laden, did not employ. But &s;o &s;oon as we were again got on &s;hore, it immediately grew as fair weather as ever it was. But the Sun continuing again to &s;hine, and the Marriners re&s;olving to &s;tay a while in the Port, and &s;ee the weather bet|ter &s;etled, I gave order to the men to make &s;ome further Provi&s;ions for us, while I went to divert my &s;elf upon the Rocks hard by; partly with the plea&s;ure of a good pro&s;pect from thence into the Gulph, and partly by &s;earching what Plants nature might be found there to produce.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, I found this Bay of <HI>A&s;pro&s;piti</HI> a very large Bay, and this Rock to be a <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> at the bottom of it, of about three Miles
<PB N="481" REF="209">compa&s;s; making a good Harbour on each &s;ide of the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of it: Its We&s;tern Promontory being <HI>Mons Cyrphis;</HI> now called <HI>Stiva.</HI> Its Ea&s;tern Promontory, is made by certain Rocks de&s;cending from the Mountains about <HI>Saint Luca Striotes,</HI> and the <HI>Helicon:</HI> and I believe 'twas anciently called <HI>Plarigum Promontorium.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">PHARIGIUM PROM. ANTICYR|RHA. MARATHON.</NOTE> For this Bay was certainly that which in older time was called <HI>Anticyrrha;</HI> and perhaps the old Town of that name might be upon this <HI>Penin&s;ula:</HI> for I &s;aw &s;ome Ruins there. Not far from <HI>Anticyrrha</HI> was al&s;o a Town of <HI>Phocis</HI> called <HI>Marathon;</HI> which, as I al&s;o conjecture, may have been the pre&s;ent Village of <HI>A&s;pro&s;piti.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all my Diverti&s;ement. For I found in clambering up tho&s;e Rocks, one of the mo&s;t pretty natural Grots I ever &s;aw. It &s;eem'd to be made on purpo&s;e for the habitation of &s;ome Hermite. The En|trance was but &s;mall: But within was a very pretty room, receiving light by a hole in the rock above; and on the left hand about a mans height from the ground, is a place that lookt like the old <HI>Hermits</HI> Bed-Chamber; whoever he was. For that &s;ome &s;uch Religious man did once live there, the aptitude of the place would not &s;uffer me to doubt. Here, within this Hermites place, I repo&s;ed my &s;elf awhile; and afterwards the weather continuing &s;till fair, I went abroad, and found very many curious Plants growing upon tho&s;e Rocks; which were a &s;econd Diver|ti&s;ement to me, nothing le&s;s agreeable than the fir&s;t. I &s;pecifie &s;uch only here, as I have not taken notice of el&s;ewhere: and of tho&s;e the&s;e that follow are the chief.</P>
<P>A kind of <HI>Syderitis,</HI> with a tuft of Blue leaves, like <HI>Horminum Cre|tieum.</HI></P>
<P>Another &s;ort, which from a long tough root hath many thick, hoary, roundi&s;h, and &s;caloped Leaves, re&s;embling the <HI>Lamiums;</HI> out of which runs a round. creeping, downy &s;tem of a reddi&s;h colour, be&s;et one above another with blui&s;h Flowers, not divided into Leaves, but whole, till near the top, much re&s;embling <HI>Trachelion;</HI> but &s;carce &s;o much open, and much le&s;s. It hath been taken for <HI>Scutellaria:</HI> but I find it not to agree with <HI>Bauhinus</HI> his De&s;cription of that Plant.</P>
<P>A very &s;mall &s;ort, or kind, of <HI>Eryngium:</HI> which I take to be that which <HI>John&s;on</HI> calls <HI>Eryngium Pucillum, Planum;</HI> only he de&s;cribes it much bigger than it groweth here; which may well be, by rea&s;on of the &s;tonine&s;s and &s;terility of the Rocks of this place.</P>
<P>When I returned to the Bark, I found them ready to depart, and wait|ing only for me. I therefore immediately return'd to Sea; and in a &s;hort time doubled the <HI>Cape,</HI> or We&s;tern Promontory of the Bay, called by them <HI>Tramachi &s;to Cri&s;&s;a, The Cape to Cri&s;&s;a,</HI> and came and &s;tayed that Night at <HI>Pendhagi,</HI> where we arrived al&s;o, when we fir&s;t came into <HI>Greece.</HI> The next Morning we were &s;oon out of the Bay of <HI>Cri&s;&s;a,</HI> or. <HI>Salona,</HI> and doubled the We&s;tern <HI>Cape</HI> of it; which they call &PSgr;<GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ignifying a <HI>Fi&s;hes Fye,</HI> and got under the &s;helter of two or three I&s;lands, between that and <HI>Lepanto;</HI> where we &s;taid until Night, that &s;o we might pa&s;s out between the Ca&s;tles at the Mouth of the Gulph, un&s;een by the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>From the fir&s;t of the&s;e Promontories, <HI>Tramachi &s;to Cri&s;&s;a,</HI> &s;o well as the motion of the Bark would permit me, I ob&s;erved

<P>So that now I think I am able, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to give you the Fi|gure of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Gulph, a place the mo&s;t fam'd for Maritime ex|ploits in all Antiquity and modern Hi&s;tory. I give it you as I have cau|&s;ed it to be Engraven in my Map of <HI>Greece;</HI> and without much boa&s;ting recommend it for the mo&s;t exact that hath been given in our times. It is only of tho&s;e parts of <HI>Greece</HI> I have &s;urveyed my &s;elf, and compre|hends the greate&s;t part of <HI>Achaia.</HI> I have made it my care to be exact in placing the Mountains, Promontories, Bayes, Rivers and Lakes accord|ing to their natural &s;ituation. Of which only I have given the antient names with the modern: as to the Towns I have given only the modern names, having a de&s;ign to give the ancient names of them in a Treati&s;e by them&s;elves, if I find it worth my pains.</P>
<P>The Night being come, and a brisk Gale with it, blowing out of the Gulph, we &s;et Sail, and about ten of the Clock we pa&s;&s;ed between both the Ca&s;tles un&s;een by the Turks: But not without very great apprehen|&s;ions, that we &s;hould have &s;ome great &s;hot let fly after us. But Heavens, that had &s;o many times wonderfully pre&s;erved me, did then al&s;o deliver me out of the hands of tho&s;e Infidels, and brought me &s;afely to <HI>Zant</HI> the next day by Noon. Whence by the fir&s;t occa&s;ion I departed for <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> where having further &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity, and congra|tulated with my Friends my pro&s;perous Voyage, I ha&s;ted to render my &s;elf to my Country, and to the long-wi&s;h'd-for Embraces of my Parents, Relations and Friends, and to give Prai&s;e to God for the <HI>Wonderful things he had done for my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>That he had placed the Lot of mine Inheritance in a Land that he had ble&s;&s;ed, and hedged about for him&s;elf: where nothing is wanting to &s;upply the defects of frail nature; but where Peace and Plenty for this many Years have &s;eem'd to embrace each other; where every Mans Right, from the Prince to the Pea&s;ant, is &s;ecured to him by the pro|tection of good and whole&s;ome Laws; And more, by a King who is the Indulgent Father of his Country, and not a Tyrant: and la&s;tly, rendred me into the Bo&s;om of a Church, that I had often heard, but now knew, to be the mo&s;t refined, pure, and Orthodox Church in the World; freed from Slavery, Errour and Super&s;tition, and without Novelty or Confu|&s;ion, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Purity of Doctrine, Decency and Order.</P>
<P>Therefore arriving at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> its Metropolitan Throne, <HI>November</HI> the 15^t^h 1676. tran&s;ported with un&s;peakable Joy at the &s;ingular Bli&s;s of my Country, Relations and Friends, far exceeding any Nation I had &s;een beyond our Britti&s;h Seas, I offered to God the Sacrifice of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, re&s;olving for ever to call upon his Great Name, who is
<PB N="483" REF="210" MS="y">the only mighty Pre&s;erver of Mankind. Who&s;e Providence encompa&s;&s;eth all his Creatures, and who never faileth tho&s;e that tru&s;t in him. Saying with the P&s;almi&s;t,</P>

<Q><P>Prai&s;e the Lord O my Soul, whil&s;t I live will I prai&s;e the Lord; yea as long as I have any Being, I will &s;ing Prai&s;es unto my God, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.</P>
<P>Glory to God in the Highe&s;t! on Earth Peace, and good will towards men.</P>
<P>Glory be to him that &s;itteth on the Throne; and to the Lamb for evermore.</P>
<P>Glory be to the Holy of Holies; and to the Promi&s;ed comforter abiding with us for ever.</P>
<P>For He is Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the Author and Fini&s;her of us, and all our Works. Therefore to him only let Prayers ever be made, and daily let him be prai&s;ed. For to him only belongeth Prai&s;e, Glory, Power, Might, Maje&s;ty, and Dominion for ever and ever, World without End, <HI>Amen.</HI></P></Q>
