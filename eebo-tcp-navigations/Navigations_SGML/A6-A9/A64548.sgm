<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THere never having been any fair or full Account given to the World of</HI> Pen|&s;ilvania, <HI>I thought the Cu|rious wou'd be gratified with an ample De&s;cription thereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For tho' this Country has made little Noi&s;e in</HI> Story, <HI>or taken up but &s;mall room in</HI> Maps, <HI>yet thus much with great Ju&s;tice may be &s;aid of it, that notwith&s;tanding the
<PB REF="4"> Difficulties and Inconvenien|cie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the</HI> Fir&s;t Engli&s;h Col|lonies <HI>met with before they were well &s;ettled there, yet the mighty Improvements, Additions, and Advantages that have been made lately there, are well worth Communicating to the Publick, and I am &s;en&s;ible they will be well receiv'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The late Tedious, Hazard|ous, and Expen&s;ive War (in which</HI> England, <HI>in Conjunction with the Allies was &s;o deeply en|gag'd) was without doubt no &s;mall Bar or Ob&s;tacle to the Flouri&s;hing of this New Country. The great Di&s;couragements the Traders thither lay under, (to|gether
<PB REF="4"> with the frequent Capture of their Ships out and home, cou'd not chu&s;e but baulk them in their hone&s;t Endeavours, which (now Peace is re&s;tor'd) they may pur|&s;ue with greater Security and Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nor is there the lea&s;t que&s;tion or doubt to be made, but this No|ble Spot of Earth will thrive ex|ceedingly, and that in a &s;hort time too, and advance con&s;iderably to the mighty Advantage of the Pre|&s;ent and Future Propietors, who have, and are willing to give all due Encouragement to any that &s;hall Tran&s;port them&s;elves thi|ther.</HI></P>
<PB REF="5">
<P><HI>I cou'd &s;ay much here in Prai&s;e of that &s;weet Tract of Land, but having &s;poken &s;o largely and particularly thereof in the Book it &s;elf, I &s;hall for|bear the lea&s;t mention in this place. Nor will I Anticipate or fore&s;tal thee, by pre&s;enting thee here with what thou wilt find there, with the greater Sa|tisfaction. And &s;o I bid thee heartily farewel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PEn&s;ilvania</HI> lies between the Latitude of Forty and Forty five Degrees: <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey</HI> on the Ea&s;t, <HI>Virgi|nia</HI> on the We&s;t, <HI>Mary-Land</HI> South, and <HI>Canada</HI> on the North. In Length three hundred, and in Breadth one hundred and eighty Miles.</P>
<P>The Natives, or fir&s;t Inhabi|tants of this Country in their Ori|ginal, are &s;uppos'd by mo&s;t Peo|ple to have been of the Ten Scat|tered Tribes, for they re&s;emble the <HI>Jews</HI> very much in the <HI>Make</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="7"> of their <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>Tincture</HI> of their <HI>Complexions:</HI> They ob&s;erve New <HI>Moons,</HI> they offer their <HI>first Fruits</HI> to a <HI>Maneto,</HI> or &s;uppos'd Dei|ty, whereof they have two, one, as they fan&s;ie, above (good,) ano|ther below (bad,) and have a kind of <HI>Fea&s;t</HI> of <HI>Tabernacles,</HI> laying their <HI>Altars</HI> upon <HI>Twelve Stones,</HI> ob|&s;erve a &s;ort of <HI>Mourning</HI> twelve Months, <HI>Cu&s;toms of Women,</HI> and many other <HI>Rites</HI> to be toucht (here) rather than dwelt upon, be|cau&s;e they &s;hall be handled more at large at the latter end of this Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>They are very Charitable to one another, the Lame and the Blind (among&s;t them) living as well as the be&s;t; they are al&s;o very kind and obliging to the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>The next that came there, were the <HI>Dutch,</HI> (who call'd the Country <HI>New Neitherland)</HI> be|tween Fifty and Sixty Years a|go,
<PB N="3" REF="7"> and were the fir&s;t <HI>Planters</HI> in tho&s;e Parts; but they made lit|tle or no Improvement, (apply|ing them&s;elves wholly to Tra|fique in Skins and Furs, which the <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Natives</HI> furni&s;h'd them with, and which they Bar|ter'd for Rum, Strong Liquors, and Sugar, with others, thereby gaining great Profit) till near the time of the Wars between <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Them,</HI> about Thirty or Forty Years ago.</P>
<P>Soon after them came the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Fins,</HI> who apply'd them&s;elves to Husbandry, and were the fir&s;t <HI>Christian</HI> People that made any con&s;iderable Im|provement there.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome Di&s;putes be|tween the&s;e two Nations &s;ome Years, the <HI>Dutch</HI> looking upon the <HI>Swedes</HI> as Intruders upon their Purcha&s;e and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was ab&s;olutely terminat|ed in the Surrender made by <HI>John
<PB N="4" REF="8"> Rizeing,</HI> the <HI>Swedes</HI> Governour, to <HI>Peter Styreant,</HI> Governour for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in 1655. In the <HI>Holland</HI> War about the Year 1665. Sir <HI>Robert Carr</HI> took the Country from the <HI>Dutch</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and left his Cou&s;in, Cap|tain <HI>Carr,</HI> Governor of that place; but in a &s;hort time after, the <HI>Dutch</HI> re-took the Country from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and kept it in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the Peace was con|cluded between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and them, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Surren|dered that <HI>Country</HI> with <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey, New-York,</HI> (with the whole Countries belonging to that Government) to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again. But it remain'd with ve|ry little Impovement till the Year 1681. in which <HI>William Penn</HI> E&s;q; had the Country given him by King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> in lieu of Money that was due to (and &s;ignal Service done by) his Father, Sir <HI>William Penn,</HI> and from him bore the Name of <HI>Pen|&s;ilvania.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<P>Since that time, the Indu&s;tri|ous (nay Indefatigable) Inhabi|tants have built a <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Beau|tiful</HI> City, and called it <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> which contains above two thou&s;and Hou&s;es, all Inhabited; and mo&s;t of them Stately, and of Brick, generally three Stories high, after the Mode in <HI>London,</HI> and as many &s;everal Families in each. There are very many <HI>Lanes</HI> and <HI>Alleys,</HI> as fir&s;t, <HI>Hut|tons-Lane, Morris-Lane, Jones's-Lane,</HI> wherein are very good Buildings; <HI>Shorters-Alley, Yowers-Lane, Wallers-Alley, Turners-Lane, Sikes-Alley,</HI> and <HI>Flowers-Alley.</HI> All the&s;e <HI>Alleys</HI> and <HI>Lanes</HI> extend from the <HI>Front Street</HI> to the <HI>Second-Street.</HI> There is another <HI>Alley</HI> in the <HI>Second Street,</HI> called <HI>Carters-Alley.</HI> There are al&s;o be&s;ides the&s;e <HI>Alleys</HI> and <HI>Lanes,</HI> &s;everal fine <HI>Squares</HI> and <HI>Courts</HI> within this Magnificent City, (for &s;o I may ju&s;tly call it.) As for the particular Names of the &s;everal
<PB N="6" REF="9"> <HI>Streets</HI> contained therein, the Principal are as follows, <HI>viz. Wal|nut-Street, Vine-Street, Mulberry-Street, Che&s;nut-Street, Sa&s;&s;afras-Street,</HI> taking their Names from the abundance of tho&s;e Trees that formerly grew there; <HI>High-Street, Broad-Street, Delaware-Street, Front-Street,</HI> with &s;everal of le&s;s Note, too tedious to in&s;ert here.</P>
<P>It hath in it Three <HI>Fairs</HI> every Year, and Two <HI>Markets</HI> every Week. They kill above Twenty <HI>Fat Bullocks</HI> every Week, in the hotte&s;t time in Summer, for their pre&s;ent &s;pending in that City, be&s;ides many <HI>Sheep, Calves,</HI> and <HI>Hogs.</HI></P>
<P>This City is Situated between <HI>Schoolkill-River</HI> and the great River <HI>Delaware,</HI> which derives its Name from Captain <HI>Delaware,</HI> who came there pretty early: Ships of Two or Three Hundred Tuns may come up to this City, by either of the&s;e two Rivers. Moreover, in this Province are Four Great <HI>Market-Towns,</HI> viz.
<PB N="7" REF="9"> <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>German Town, New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and <HI>Lewis-Town,</HI> which are mightily Enlarged in this latter Improvement. Between the&s;e Towns, the Water-Men con|&s;tantly Ply their <HI>Wherries;</HI> like|wi&s;e all tho&s;e Towns have <HI>Fairs</HI> kept in them, be&s;ides there are &s;everal Country Villages, <HI>viz. Dublin, Harford, Merioneth,</HI> and <HI>Radnor</HI> in <HI>Cumbry;</HI> all which <HI>Towns, Villages</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> took their Names from the &s;everal <HI>Countries</HI> whence the pre&s;ent In|habitants came.</P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> here is very delicate, plea&s;ant, and whole&s;om; the <HI>Heavens</HI> &s;erene, rarely overca&s;t, bearing mighty re&s;emblance to the better part of <HI>France;</HI> after Rain they have commonly a ve|ry clear Sky, the Climate is &s;ome|thing Colder in the depth of Winter, and Hotter in the height of Summer; (the cau&s;e of which is its being a Main Land or Continent; the Days al&s;o are
<PB N="8" REF="10"> two Hours longer in the &s;horte&s;t Day in Winter, and &s;horter by two Hours in the longe&s;t Day of Summer) than here in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which makes the Fruit &s;o good, and the Earth &s;o fertil.</P>
<P>The Corn-Harve&s;t is ended be|fore the middle of <HI>July,</HI> and mo&s;t Years they have commonly be|tween Twenty and Thirty Bu&s;hels of Wheat for every one they Sow. Their Ground is harrowed with Wooden Tyn|ed Harrows, twice over in a place is &s;ufficient; twice mend|ing of their Plow-Irons in a Years time will &s;erve. Their Hor&s;es commonly go without being &s;hod; two Men may clear be|tween Twenty and Thirty A|cres of Land in one Year, fit for the Plough, in which Oxen are chiefly us'd, though Hor&s;es are not wanting, and of them Good and well &s;hap'd. A Cart or a Wain may go through the mid|dle of the Woods, between the
<PB N="9" REF="10"> Trees without getting any da|mage, and of &s;uch Land in a convenient place, the Purcha&s;e will co&s;t between <HI>Ten</HI> and <HI>Fif|teen Pounds</HI> for a Hundred Acres. * Here is much Meadow Ground. Poor People both Men and Wo|men, will get near three times more Wages for their Labour in this Country, than they can earn either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>What is Inhabited of this Country, is divided into Six <HI>Counties,</HI> though there is not the Twentieth Part of it, yet Peopled by the <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> It hath in it &s;everal Navigable Rivers for Shipping to come in, be&s;ides the Capital <HI>Delaware,</HI> wherein a Ship of Two Hundred Tuns may Sail Two Hundred Miles up. There are al&s;o &s;everal other &s;mall Rivers, in number hardly Cre|dible; the&s;e, as the Brooks, have for the mo&s;t part gravelly and hard Bottoms; and it is &s;up|pos'd that there are many other further up in the Country, which
<PB N="10" REF="11"> are not yet di&s;cover'd; the Names of the afore&s;aid Rivers, are, <HI>Hoorkill-River,</HI> alias <HI>Lewis River,</HI> which runs up to <HI>Lewis Town,</HI> the chiefe&s;t in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex Coun|ty; Cedar-River, Muskmellon-Ri|ver,</HI> all taking their Names from the great plenty of the&s;e things growing there abouts; <HI>Mother-kill</HI> alias <HI>Dover-River,</HI> St. <HI>Jones</HI>'s alias <HI>Cranbrook-River,</HI> where one <HI>John Curtice</HI> lives, who hath Three Hundred Head of Neat Bea&s;ts, be&s;ides great Numbers of <HI>Hogs, Hor&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Sheep; Great Duck-River, Little Duck-River, Black-Bird-River,</HI> the&s;e al&s;o took their Original Names from the great Numbers of tho&s;e Fowls which are found there in va&s;t quan|tities; <HI>Apequinemy-River,</HI> where their Goods come to be Carted over to <HI>Mary-Land.</HI> St. <HI>George</HI>'s-<HI>River, Chri&s;ten-River, Brandy-Wine-River, &V;pland</HI> alias <HI>Chester-River,</HI> which runs by <HI>Chester-Town,</HI> being the Shire or Coun|ty-Town; <HI>Schoolkill-River, Frank|ford-River,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="11"> near which, <HI>Arthur Cook</HI> hath a mo&s;t Stately Brick-Hou&s;e; and <HI>Ni&s;hamany-River,</HI> where Judge <HI>Growden</HI> hath a ve|ry Noble and Fine Hou&s;e, very plea&s;antly Situated, and likewi&s;e a Famous Orchard adjoyn|ing to it, wherein are contain'd above a Thou&s;and Apple Trees of various &s;orts; likewi&s;e there is the famous <HI>Derby-River,</HI> which comes down from the <HI>Cumbry</HI> by <HI>Derby-Town,</HI> wherein are &s;e|veral <HI>Mills,</HI> viz. <HI>Fulling-Mills, Corn-Mills,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is curious <HI>Building-Stone</HI> and <HI>Paving-Stone,</HI> al&s;o <HI>Tile-Stone,</HI> with which latter, Governor <HI>Penn</HI> covered his <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Stately Pile,</HI> which he call'd <HI>Pennsbury-Hou&s;e,</HI> the Name it &s;till retains. There is likewi&s;e <HI>Iron-Stone</HI> or <HI>Oar,</HI> (lately found) which far ex|ceeds that in <HI>England,</HI> being Richer and le&s;s Dro&s;&s;y; &s;ome Pre|parations have been made to carry on an Iron-Work: There
<PB N="12" REF="12"> is al&s;o very good <HI>Lime-Stone</HI> in great plenty, and cheap, of great u&s;e in Buildings, and al&s;o in Manu|ring Land, (if there were occa|&s;ion) but Nature has made that of it &s;elf &s;ufficiently Fruitful; be&s;ides here are <HI>Load-Stones, I&s;ing-Gla&s;s,</HI> and (that Wonder of Stones) the <HI>Salamander-Stone,</HI> found near <HI>Brandy-Wine-River,</HI> having <HI>Cotton</HI> in Veins within it, which will not con&s;ume in the Fire, though held there a long time.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Minerals,</HI> or <HI>Metals,</HI> there is very good <HI>Copper,</HI> far exceeding ours in <HI>England,</HI> be|ing much Finer, and of a more glorious Colour. Not two Mile from the <HI>Metropolis,</HI> are al&s;o <HI>Purg|ing Mineral-Waters,</HI> that pa&s;s both by <HI>Siege</HI> and <HI>&V;rine,</HI> all out as good as <HI>Ep&s;om:</HI> And I have rea|&s;on to believe, there are good <HI>Coals</HI> al&s;o, for I ob&s;erv'd, the Runs of Water have the &s;ame Colour as that which pro|ceeds from the <HI>Coal-Mines</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>Here is curious Diver&s;ion in Hunting, Fi&s;hing, and Fowling, e&s;pecially upon that Great and Famous River <HI>Suskahanah,</HI> which runs down quite through the heart of the Country to <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> where it makes the Head of <HI>Che&s;epeck-Bay,</HI> in which place there are an Infinite Number of Sea and Land Fowl, of mo&s;t &s;orts, <HI>viz.

<PB N="14" REF="13"> As al&s;o the large &s;ort of Fi&s;h, as <HI>Whales</HI> (of which a great deal of Oyl is made) <HI>Salmon, Trout, Sturgeon, Rock, Oy&s;ters,</HI> (&s;ome &s;ix Inches long) <HI>Crabs, Cockles,</HI> (&s;ome as big as Stewing <HI>Oy&s;ters</HI> of which are made a Choice Soupe or Broth) <HI>Canok</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;&s;els,</HI> with many other &s;orts of Fi&s;h, which would be too tedious to in&s;ert.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of wild <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> of great Profit, and good Food; <HI>viz. Panthers, Woolves, Fither, Deer, Beaver, Otter, Hares, Musk-Rats, Minks, Wild-Cats, Foxes, Rackoons, Rabits,</HI> and that &s;trange Creature, the <HI>Po&s;&s;am,</HI> &s;he having a fal&s;e Belly to &s;wal|low her Young ones, by which means &s;he pre&s;erveth them from danger, when any thing comes to di&s;turb them.

<P>There are in the Woods abun|dance of <HI>Red Deer</HI> (vulgarly call|ed <HI>Stags)</HI> for I have bought of the <HI>Indians</HI> a whole <HI>Buck,</HI> (both Skin and Carca&s;s) for two Gills of Gunpowder. Excellent Food, mo&s;t delicious, far exceeding that in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the Opinion of mo&s;t that are Nice and Curious People.

<P>They have commonly <HI>Two Harve&s;ts</HI> in the Year; Fir&s;t, of <HI>Engli&s;h Wheat,</HI> and next of <HI>Buck,</HI> (or <HI>French)</HI> Wheat.

<P><HI>Bees</HI> thrive and multiply ex|ceedingly in tho&s;e Parts, the <HI>Sweeds</HI> often get great &s;tore of them in the Woods, where they are free for any Body. Honey (and choice too) is &s;old in the Capital City for Five Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound. Wax is al&s;o plentiful, cheap, and a con&s;iderable Com|merce. Tame Fowls, as <HI>Chickens, Hens, Gee&s;e, Ducks, Turkeys,</HI> &amp;c. are large, and very plentiful all over this Countrey.</P>
<P>And now for their Lots and Lands in City and Countrey, in their great Advancement &s;ince they were fir&s;t laid out, which was within the compa&s;s of about Twelve Years, that which might have been bought for Fifteen or Eighteen Shillings, is now &s;old for Four&s;core Pounds in ready Silver; and &s;ome other Lots, that might have been then
<PB N="24" REF="18"> Purcha&s;ed for Three Pounds, within the &s;pace of Two Years, were &s;old for a Hundred Pounds a piece, and likewi&s;e &s;ome Land that lies near the City, that Sixteen Years ago might have been Purchas'd for Six or Eight Pounds the Hundred Acres, can|not now be bought under One Hundred and Fifty, or Two Hundred Pounds.</P>
<P>Now the true Rea&s;on why this Fruitful Countrey and Flo|ri&s;hing City advance &s;o con&s;i|derably in the Purcha&s;e of Lands both in the one and the other, is their great and extended Traf|fique and Commerce both by Sea and Land, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>New-York, New-England, Virginia, Mary-Land, Carolina, Jamaica, Barba|does, Nevis, Mon&s;erat, Antego,</HI> St. <HI>Cri&s;tophers, Barmudoes, New-Found-Land, Maderas, Saltetudeous,</HI> and <HI>Old-England;</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal o|ther places. Their Merchandize chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Hor&s;es, Pipe-Staves,
<PB N="25" REF="18"> Pork</HI> and <HI>Beef</HI> Salted and Barrelled up, <HI>Bread,</HI> and <HI>Flower,</HI> all &s;orts of Grain, <HI>Pea&s;e, Beans, Skins, Furs, Tobacco,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">t-A&s;hes, Wax,</HI> &amp;c. which are Barter'd for <HI>Rumm, Sugar, Mo|la&s;&s;es, Silver, Negroes, Salt, Wine, Linen, Hou&s;hold-Goods,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>However there &s;till remain Lots of Land both in the afore|&s;aid City and Country, that a|ny may Purcha&s;e almo&s;t as cheap as they could at the fir&s;t Laying out or Parcelling of either City or Country; which is, (in the Judgment of mo&s;t People) the likelie&s;t to turn to account to tho&s;e that lay their Money out upon it, and in a &s;horter time than the aforementioned Lots and Lands that are already im|proved, and for &s;everal Rea&s;ons. In the fir&s;t place, the Countrey is now well inhabited by the Chri&s;tians, who have great Stocks of all &s;orts of Cattle, that encrea&s;e extraordinarily, and up|on
<PB N="26" REF="19"> that account they are oblig'd to go farther up into the Coun|trey, becau&s;e there is the chiefe&s;t and be&s;t place for their Stocks, and for them that go back into the Countrey, they get the riche&s;t Land, for the be&s;t lies thereabouts.</P>
<P>Secondly, Farther into the Countrey is the Principal Place to Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> for all &s;orts of <HI>Pelt,</HI> as <HI>Skins</HI> and <HI>Furs,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Fat Veni&s;on,</HI> of whom People may Purcha&s;e cheaper by three Parts in four than they can at the City of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Backwards in the Countrey lies the <HI>Mines</HI> where is <HI>Copper</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> be&s;ides other <HI>Metals,</HI> and <HI>Minerals,</HI> of which there is &s;ome Improvement made already in order to bring them, to greater Perfection; and that will be a means to erect more Inland Market-Towns,
<PB N="27" REF="19"> which exceedingly promote Traffick.</P>
<P>Fourthly, and la&s;tly, Becau&s;e the Countrey at the fir&s;t, lay|ing out, was void of Inhabi|tants (except the Heathens, or very few Chri&s;tians not worth naming) and not many People caring to abandon a quiet and ea&s;ie (at lea&s;t tolerable) Life in their Native Countrey (u&s;ually the mo&s;t agreeable to all Man|kind) to &s;eek out a new hazard|ous, and careful one in a Fo|reign Wilderne&s;s or De&s;art Coun|trey, wholly de&s;titute of Chri|&s;tian Inhabitants, and even to arrive at which, they mu&s;t pa&s;s over a va&s;t Ocean, expos'd to &s;ome Dangers, and not a few In|conveniencies: But now all tho&s;e Cares, Fears and Hazards are vani&s;hed, for the Countrey is pretty well Peopled, and very much Improv'd, and will be more every Day, now the Dove
<PB N="28" REF="20"> is return'd with the Olive-branch of Peace in her Mouth.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, even the pre&s;ent Encouragements are ve|ry great and inviting, for Poor People (both Men and Women) of all kinds, can here get three times the Wages for their La|bour they can in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall in&s;tance in a few, which may &s;erve; nay, and will hold in all the re&s;t. The fir&s;t was a <HI>Black-Smith,</HI> (my next Neighbour) who him&s;elf and one Negro Man he had, got Fifty Shillings in one Day, by working up a Hundred Pound Weight of Iron, which at Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound (and that is the common Price in that Coun|trey) amounts to that Summ.</P>
<P>And for <HI>Carpenters,</HI> both <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Ship, Brick-layers, Ma|&s;ons,</HI> either of the&s;e Trades-Men,
<PB N="29" REF="20"> will get between Five and Six Shillings every Day con&s;tantly. As to <HI>Journey-Men Shooe-Makers,</HI> they have Two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Pair both for Men and Womens Shooes: And <HI>Journey-Men Tay|lors</HI> have Twelve Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week and their Diet. <HI>Sawyers</HI> get between Six and Seven Shil|lings the Hundred for Cutting of Pine-Boards. And for <HI>Wea|vers,</HI> they have Ten or Twelve Pence the Yard for Weaving of that which is little more than half a Yard in breadth. <HI>Wooll-Combers,</HI> have for combing Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound. <HI>Pot|ters</HI> have Sixteen Pence for an Earthen Pot which may be bought in <HI>England</HI> for Four Pence. <HI>Tanners,</HI> may buy their Hides green for Three Half Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound, and &s;ell their Leather for Twelve Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound. And <HI>Curriers</HI> have Three Shillings and Four Pence <HI>per</HI> Hide for Dre&s;&s;ing it; they buy their Oyl at Twenty
<PB N="30" REF="21"> Pence <HI>per</HI> Gallon. <HI>Brick-Makers</HI> have Twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Thou|&s;and for their Bricks at the Kiln. <HI>Felt-Makers</HI> will have for their Hats Seven Shillings a piece, &s;uch as may be bought in <HI>Eng|land</HI> for Two Shillings a piece; yet they buy their <HI>Wooll</HI> com|monly for Twelve or Fifteen Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound. And as to the <HI>Glaziers,</HI> they will have Five Pence a Quarry for their Gla&s;s. The Rule for the <HI>Coo|pers</HI> I have almo&s;t forgot; but this I can affirm of &s;ome who went from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> (as their Neighbours report) that could hardly get their Livelihoods there, are now reckon'd in <HI>Pen|&s;ilvania,</HI> by a mode&s;t Computa|tion to be worth &s;ome Hun|dreds, (if not Thou&s;ands) of Pounds. The <HI>Bakers</HI> make as White Bread as any in <HI>London,</HI> and as for their Rule, it is the &s;ame in all Parts of the World that I have been in. The <HI>But|chers</HI> for killing a Bea&s;t, have Five
<PB N="31" REF="21"> Shillings and their Diet; and they may buy a good fat large Cow for Three Pounds, or there|abouts. The <HI>Brewers</HI> fell &s;uch Beer as is equal in Strength to that in <HI>London,</HI> half Ale and half Stout for Fifteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel; and their Beer hath a better Name, that is, is in more e&s;teem than <HI>Engli&s;h Beer</HI> in <HI>Bar|badoes,</HI> and is &s;old for a higher Price there. And for <HI>Silver-Smiths,</HI> they have between Half a Crown and Three Shillings an Ounce for working their Silver, and for Gold equivalent. <HI>Pla|&s;terers</HI> have commonly Eighteen Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard for <HI>Pla&s;tering. La&s;t-Makers</HI> have Sixteen Shil|lings <HI>per</HI> dozen for their La&s;ts. And <HI>Heel-Makers</HI> have Two Shillings a dozen for their Heels. <HI>Wheel</HI> and <HI>Mill-Wrights, Joyners, Bra&s;iers, Pewterers, Dyers, Fullers, Comb-Makers, Wyer-Drawers, Cage-Makers, Card-Makers, Painters, Cutlers, Rope-Makers, Carvers, Block-Makers, Turners, Button-Makers,
<PB N="32" REF="22"> Hair</HI> and <HI>Wood Sieve-Makers, Bodies-Makers, Gun-Smiths, Lock-Smiths, Nailers, File-Cuters, Skinners, Furriers, Glovers, Patten-Makers, Watch-Makers, Clock-Makers, Sadlers, Coller-Makers, Barbers, Printers, Book-Binders,</HI> and all other <HI>Trades-Men,</HI> their Gains and Wages are about the &s;ame proportion as the fore|mentioned Trades in their Ad|vancements, as to what they have in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Lawyers</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, becau&s;e this Countrey is very Peaceable and Healty; long may it &s;o continue and never have occa&s;ion for the Tongue of the one, nor the Pen of the other, both equally de&s;truc|tive to Mens E&s;tates and Lives; be&s;ides for&s;ooth, they, Hang-Man like, have a Licen&s;e to Mur|der and make Mi&s;chief. <HI>Labour|ing-Men</HI> have commonly here, between 14 and 15 Pounds a Year, and their Meat, Drink,
<PB N="33" REF="22"> Wa&s;hing and Lodging; and by the Day their Wages is general|ly between Eighteen Pence and Half a Crown, and Diet al&s;o; But in Harve&s;t they have u&s;ual|ly between Three and Four Shil|ling each Day, and Diet. The <HI>Maid Servants Wages</HI> is common|ly betwixt Six and Ten Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> with very good Accommodation. And for the <HI>Women</HI> who get their Livelihood by their own Indu&s;try, their Labour is very dear, for I can buy in <HI>London</HI> a Chee&s;e-Cake for Two Pence, bigger than theirs at that price, when at the &s;ame time their Milk is as cheap as we can buy it in <HI>London,</HI> and their Flour cheaper by one half.</P>
<P>Corn and Fle&s;h, and what el&s;e &s;erves Man for Drink, Food and Rayment, is much cheaper here than in <HI>England,</HI> or el&s;ewhere; but the chief rea|&s;on why Wages of Servants of all &s;orts is much higher here
<PB N="34" REF="23"> than there, ari&s;es from the great Fertility and Produce of the Place; be&s;ides, if the&s;e large Stipends were refu&s;ed them, they would quickly &s;et up for them&s;elves, for they can have Provi&s;ion very cheap, and Land for a very &s;mall matter, or next to nothing in compari&s;on of the Purchace of Lands in <HI>England;</HI> and the Farmers there, can bet|ter afford to give that great Wages than the Farmers in <HI>Eng|land</HI> can, for &s;everal Rea&s;ons ve|ry obvious.</P>
<P>As Fir&s;t, their Land co&s;ts them (as I &s;aid but ju&s;t now) little or nothing in compari&s;on, of which the Farmers com|monly will get twice the en|crea&s;e of Corn for every Bu|&s;hel they &s;ow, that the Farmers in <HI>England</HI> can from the riche&s;t Land they have.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="23">
<P>In the Second place, they have con&s;tantly good price for their Corn, by rea&s;on of the great and quick vent into <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and other I&s;lands; through which means <HI>Silver</HI> is become more plentiful than here in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> con&s;idering the Number of People, and that cau&s;es a quick Trade for both Corn and Cattle; and that is the rea&s;on that Corn differs now from the Price formerly, el&s;e it would be at half the Price it was at then; for a Brother of mine (to my own particular knowledge) &s;old within the compa&s;s of one Week, about One Hundred and Twen|ty fat Bea&s;ts, mo&s;t of them good hand&s;om large Oxen.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They pay no <HI>Tithes,</HI> and their <HI>Taxes</HI> are incon&s;idera|ble; the Place is free for all Per|&s;ua&s;ions, in a Sober and Civil way; for the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Quakers</HI> bear equal Share
<PB N="36" REF="24"> in the Government. They live Friendly and Well together; there is no Per&s;ecution for Re|ligion, nor ever like to be; 'tis this that knocks all Commerce on the Head, together with high Impo&s;ts, &s;trict Laws, and cramp|ing Orders. Before I end this Paragraph, I &s;hall add another Rea&s;on why Womens Wages are &s;o exorbitant; they are not yet very numerous, which makes them &s;tand upon high Terms for their &s;everal Services, in <HI>Semp&s;tering, Wa&s;hing, Spinning, Knitting, Sewing,</HI> and in all the other parts of their Imploy|ments; for they have for Spin|ning either Wor&s;ted or Linen, Two Shillings a Pound, and commonly for Knitting a very Cour&s;e pair of Yarn Stockings, they have half a Crown a pair; moreover they are u&s;ually Mar|ry'd before they are Twenty Years of Age, and when once in that Noo&s;e, are for the mo&s;t part a little unea&s;ie, and make
<PB N="37" REF="24"> their Husbands &s;o too, till they procure them a Maid Servant to bear the burden of the Work, as al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure to wait on them too.</P>
<P>It is now time to return to the City of <HI>Brotherly-Love</HI> (for &s;o much the <HI>Greek</HI> Word or Name <HI>Philadelphia</HI> imports) which though at pre&s;ent &s;o ob|&s;cure, that neither the <HI>Map-Makers,</HI> nor <HI>Geographers</HI> have ta|ken the lea&s;t notice of her, tho &s;he far exceeds her Name|&s;ake of <HI>Lydia,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thirty</HI> German <HI>Miles from</HI> Smyrna.</NOTE> (having above Two Thou&s;and Noble Hou&s;es for her Five Hundred Ordinary) or <HI>Celi&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Coele&s;yria;</HI> yet in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time &s;he will; in all probability, make a a fine Figure in the World, and be a mo&s;t Celebrated <HI>Emporeum.</HI> Here is lately built a Noble <HI>Town-Hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> al&s;o a Hand&s;om <HI>Market-Hou&s;e,</HI> and a convenient <HI>Pri&s;on.</HI> The Num|ber of Chri&s;tians both Old and

<P><HI>WE&s;t-New-Jer&s;ey</HI> lies between the La|titude of Forty, and Forty two Degrees; having the <HI>Main Sea</HI> on the South, <HI>Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey</HI> on
<PB N="2" REF="41"> the North, <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Bay</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and <HI>Pen&s;ilvania</HI> on the We&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Inhabitants of this Countrey were the <HI>In|dians,</HI> being &s;uppo&s;ed to be part of the Ten di&s;per&s;ed Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> for indeed they are very like the <HI>Jews</HI> in their Per&s;ons, and &s;omething in their Practices and Wor&s;hip, for they (as the <HI>Pen&s;ilvanian Indians)</HI> ob&s;erve the <HI>New Moons</HI> with great Devotion, and Re|verence: And their fir&s;t Fruits they offer, with their Corn and Hunting-Game they get in the whole Year, to a Fal&s;e Deity or Sham-God, whom they mu&s;t plea&s;e, el&s;e (as they fancy) many Misfor|tunes will befal them, and great Injuries will be done them. When they bury their Dead, they put into the Ground with
<PB N="3" REF="41"> them &s;ome Hou&s;e-Uten&s;ils, and &s;ome Money, (as Tokens of their Love and Affection) with other Things, expecting they &s;hall have Occa&s;ion for them again in the other World. And if a Per&s;on of Note dies very far from the Place of his own Re&s;idence they will carry his Bones home &s;ome con&s;ide|rable time after, to be bu|ried there. They are al&s;o ve|ry curious, nay, even nice in pre&s;erving and repairing the Graves of their Dead. They do not love to be asked twice their Judgment about one Thing. They are a People who generally delight much in Mirth, and are very &s;tudious in ob&s;erving the Vertues of <HI>Roots</HI> and <HI>Herbs,</HI> by which they cure them&s;elves of many Di&s;tempers in their Bo|dies, both internal or external. They will not &s;uffer their <HI>Beards</HI> to grow; for they
<PB N="4" REF="42"> will pluck the Hair off with their own Fingers as &s;oon as they can get hold of it, hold|ing it great Deformity to have a Beard. They are very lo|ving to one another; for if three or four of them come in|to a Chri&s;tian's Hou&s;e, and the Ma&s;ter of it happen to give one of them Victuals, and none to the re&s;t, he will divide it into equal Shares among them: And they are al&s;o very kind and civil to any of the Chri|&s;tians; for I my &s;elf have had Victuals cut by them in their Cabbins, before they took any for them&s;elves. Their chief Imployment is in Hunting, Fi&s;hing, and Fowling, and making <HI>Canows,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Boats and Bowls, in all which Arts they are very dexterous and ingenious: Their Womens Bu|&s;ine&s;s chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in plan|ting of <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> and pound|ing
<PB N="5" REF="42"> it to Meal, in Mortars, with Pe&s;tils, (as we beat our Spice) and make Bread, and dre&s;s their Victuals, which they perform very neatly and cleanlily. They al&s;o make <HI>Indian Mats, Ropes, Hats,</HI> and <HI>Baskets,</HI> (&s;ome of curious Workman&s;hip) of their <HI>Hemp,</HI> which there grows wild, and Natural, in the Woods, in great Plenty. In &s;hort, the Women are very ingenious in their &s;everal Imployments as well as the Men. Their young Maids are naturally very mo|de&s;t and &s;hamefac'd: And their young Women when newly married, are very nice and &s;hy, and will not &s;uffer the Men to talk of any immode&s;t or la&s;civious Matters. Their Hou&s;es are, for the mo&s;t part, cover'd with <HI>Che&s;nutt Bark,</HI> but very clo&s;e, and warm, in&s;omuch that no Rain can
<PB REF="43"> go through. Their Age in Computation may be com|pared with the Chri&s;tians.

<P>The next who came there were the <HI>Dutch;</HI> which was between Forty and Fifty Years agoe, though they made but very little Improvement, only built Two or Three Hou&s;es, upon an I&s;land (called &s;ince by the <HI>Engli&s;h) Stacies-I&s;land;</HI> and it remained &s;o, till about the Year 1675. in which King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second (or the Duke of <HI>York</HI> (his Brother) gave the Countrey to <HI>Edward Billing,</HI> in who&s;e time, one <HI>Major Fenwick</HI> went thither, with &s;ome others, and built a pretty <HI>Town,</HI> and call'd it

<P>There are very many fine <HI>&s;tately Brick-Hou&s;es</HI> built, and a <HI>commodious Dock</HI> for <HI>Ve&s;&s;els</HI> to come in at, and they claim equal
<PB N="16" REF="48"> Privilege with <HI>Burlington</HI> for the &s;ake of Antiquity; tho' that is the principal Place, by rea&s;on that the late Go|vernor <HI>Cox,</HI> who bought that Countrey of <HI>Edward Billing,</HI> en|couraged and promoted that Town chiefly, in &s;ettling his <HI>Agents</HI> and <HI>Deputy-Governors</HI> there, (the &s;ame Favours are conti|nued by the <HI>New-We&s;t-Jer&s;ey</HI> Society, who now manage Matters there) which brings their A&s;&s;emblies and chief Courts to be kept there; and, by that means it is become a very famous Town, having a great many &s;tately <HI>Brick-Hou&s;es</HI> in it, (as I &s;aid before) with a delicate great <HI>Market-Hou&s;e,</HI> where they keep their Market: It hath a noble and <HI>&s;pacious Hall</HI> over-head, where their <HI>Se&s;&s;ions</HI> is kept, having the Pri&s;on adjoining to it.</P>

<P>Courteous Reader, As yet I have given thee no Account of <HI>Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> becau&s;e I never was there, &s;o in reality can|not properly or pertinently &s;peak to that Matter. I will not pretend to impo&s;e any thing on the World, but have all
<PB N="30" REF="55"> along, and &s;hall &s;till declare nothing but Verity; therefore one Word of that by and by. I might have given thee a much larger Account of this Coun|trey, and have &s;tretch'd this (now) Pocket Volume to an extraordinary Bulk and Size; and yet without &s;training or deviating in the lea&s;t from the Principles of my Profe&s;&s;ion, which are Truth it &s;elf. I have no Plot in my Pate, or deep De&s;ign, no, not the lea&s;t ex|pectation of gaining any thing by them that go thither, or lo&s;ing by tho&s;e who &s;tay here. My End chiefly in Writing, nay, indeed my great Aim, is to inform the People of <HI>Bri|tain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> in general, but particularly the Poor, who are begging, or near it, or &s;tar|ving, or hard by it (as I be|fore took notice in my Pre|face) to encourage them (for
<PB N="31" REF="55"> their own Good, and for the Honour and Benefit of their Native Countrey, to whom they are now a Scandal and Di&s;grace; and who&s;e <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Honey</HI> the&s;e <HI>Drones</HI> eat up, and are be&s;ides a heavy Burden to the Commonwealth, in the Taxes paid by every Pari&s;h in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &amp;c. to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Law-Cau&s;es are here (as in <HI>Pen&s;ilvania)</HI> &s;peedily determi|ned, in the &s;econd Court at lea&s;t, unle&s;s in &s;ome difficult Bu&s;ine&s;s. One Ju&s;tice of the Peace hath Power to try a Cau&s;e, and give Judgment there|in, if the Original Debt be under forty Shillings. And for Thieves and Robbers (as I hin|ted before in the Preface) they mu&s;t re&s;tore fourfold; which, if they are not able to do, they mu&s;t work hard till the in|jured Per&s;on is &s;atisfied.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="56">
<P>I &s;hall conclude with a Word or two on <HI>New-Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey.</HI> This Countrey is exceeding fruitful in <HI>Cattel,</HI> of which I have &s;een great numbers brought from thence, <HI>viz. Oxen, Cows, Sheep, Hogs,</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> to <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Pen&s;ilvania.</HI> The chiefe&s;t Manufactory (be|&s;ides <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Grain) fit for Traffick that this Coun|trey affords.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall give thee an Account of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manu|factory, that each County in <HI>We&s;t-New-Jer&s;ey</HI> affords. In the fir&s;t Place I &s;hall begin with <HI>Bur|lington-County,</HI> as for <HI>Peltage,</HI> or <HI>Bea|vers Skins,! Otter-Skins, Minks Skins, Musk-rats Skins, Rackcoon, Wild Cats, Martin,</HI> and <HI>Deer-Skins,</HI> &amp;c. The Trade in <HI>Gloce&s;ter-County</HI> con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in <HI>Pitch, Tar,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;in;</HI> the latter of
<PB N="33" REF="56"> which is made by <HI>Robert Styles,</HI> an excellent Arti&s;t in that &s;ort of Work, for he delivers it as clear as any <HI>Gum-Arabick.</HI> The Commerce carried on in <HI>Salam-County,</HI> is chiefly <HI>Rice,</HI> of which they have wonderful Produce every Year; as al&s;o of <HI>Cran|berries</HI> which grow there in great plenty, and which in Picle might be brought to <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> The Commodities of <HI>Cap|may-County,</HI> are <HI>Oyl</HI> and <HI>Whale-Bone,</HI> of which they make pro|digious, nay va&s;t quantities eve|ry Year, having mightily ad|vanc'd that great Fi&s;hery, tak|ing great numbers of Whales yearly. This Country for the general part of it, is extraordi|nary good, and proper for the rai&s;ing of all &s;orts of Cattel, very plentiful here, as Cows, Hor&s;es, Sheep, and Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> likewi&s;e it is well Stor'd with &s;e|veral &s;orts of Fruits which make
<PB N="34" REF="57"> very good and plea&s;ant Liquors, &s;uch as their Neighbouring Coun|try before mention'd affords. Now Reader, having no more to add of any moment or im|portance, I &s;alute thee in Chri&s;t; and whether thou &s;taye&s;t in <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland,</HI> or <HI>Wales,</HI> or goe&s;t to <HI>Pen&s;ilvania, We&s;t</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> I wi&s;h thee all Health and Happine&s;s in this, and Everla&s;ting Comfort (in God) in the World to come. Fare thee well.</P>
