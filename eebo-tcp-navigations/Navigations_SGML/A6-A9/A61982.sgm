<HEAD>Of the <HI>GRISONS</HI> Country.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> Country is much more Barren than <HI>Switzerland,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis wholy upon the <HI>Mountains,</HI> which produce nothing at all; yet notwith&s;tanding (all Exce&s;s and Luxury being bani&s;hed from among&s;t them, and the Inhabitants being extreamly Laborious) there are none to be &s;een there that are very poor and needy; but they live at Ea&s;e, and there are a great many Gentry of good E&s;tates. Their <HI>Government</HI> is altogether <HI>Popular;</HI> there are but three or four Royalties belonging to No|bility in all the Country. All the re&s;t of their Lands are in Demeane, which may yet well be called Royalties too, becau&s;e exempt from all dues and payments what&s;oever. There is nothing at all to be pay'd for bringing into the Country any &s;ort of Goods or Merchandi&s;es, or for exporting of them thence; every one there fully enjoys the Fruit of his own Labours, and the revenues of his Land; although the Wine they drink is brought upon Hor&s;es four or five days Journey, yet they have it cheaper there than in mo&s;t parts of <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> where it &s;o plentifully grows. There are <HI>Villages</HI> upon the very tops of the <HI>Mountains,</HI> con|&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ting of 250. and 200. Hou&s;es apiece; and altho' they have no Corn or grain that grows there, and but very little Gra&s;s, yet the <HI>Pea|&s;ants</HI> keep three or four hundred Hor&s;es which they imploy to carry goods and Merchandi&s;es,
<PB N="7" REF="4"> which turns to &s;o good account that they live very well, and want nothing either for the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Convenience of life. The <HI>Inns</HI> upon the Mountains are very good; and there is al|ways to be had, be&s;ides good Bread and Wine, great quantity of Game and Veni&s;on, according to the Sea&s;on of the Year, good Trouts, very good Chambers, and Beds after the manner of the Country. When you leave the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> Country, and are come into the Country of <HI>Chavenne,</HI> the People begin to &s;peak broken <HI>Italian:</HI> altho' this latter is a more fertil Coun|try, yet the Inhabitants and <HI>Pea&s;ants</HI> do not live &s;o well as in the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> Country, for that the Natives are more &s;lothful and lazy: and here again there are abundance of poor People, as you will find in all parts of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<P>THe <HI>Duke of Ferrara</HI> hath always been but a little <HI>Prince,</HI> becau&s;e his <HI>Dominions</HI> are not very great; yet there have been &s;everal of the &s;aid <HI>Dukes</HI> for above 150. years ago, and &s;ince, that have made a hand&s;ome Figure, and held a con&s;iderable Rank among&s;t the <HI>Princes of Italy.</HI> The Country was formerly very popu|lous, and the Lands being fertil, and well cul|tivated: the Revenue of the <HI>Prince</HI> were con|&s;iderable, and he kept a good Court.

There were formly in the time of the Dukes of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> more than one hundred thou&s;and <HI>People,</HI> and at pre&s;ent there are not 15000.

The great Actions are well known which they have done in the <HI>Levant</HI> by their Fleets, and how they along time oppo&s;ed the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> who at length &s;ubdued them by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Pi&s;a</HI> is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t beauti|ful Cities of <HI>Italy;</HI> the Buildings are &s;tately and fine; and &s;o is one of their Churches,
<PB N="15" REF="7"> which with its dependancies, is one of the fine&s;t in all <HI>Italy.</HI> The City is built upon the River of <HI>Arne,</HI> which divides it in the mid&s;t; it is Navigable for Ve&s;&s;els of a great burthen: and at <HI>Legorne,</HI> which is Twelve Miles di|&s;tance, it falls into the Sea. It is one of the be&s;t &s;cituated Towns in all <HI>Italy</HI> for Trade, with which it flouri&s;hed extreamly whil&s;t it was a <HI>Republick:</HI> at pre&s;ent not only the City, but the Country belonging to it, is wholly de|populated. Writers &s;ay, that there were formerly above one hundred and fifty Thou|&s;and Inhabitants, whereas now there are not twelve Thou&s;and. The Gra&s;s grows in mo&s;t of the Places and Streets of the City, and mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es are de&s;erted, and lye void.

<P>The City of <HI>Sienna</HI> was al&s;o formerly a very fine <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> and had in it many noble, rich, and powerful Families; but &s;ince that the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Florence</HI> hath reduced it to his

<HEAD>Remarks upon the <HI>Temporal Government</HI> of the <HI>POPE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are certainly very few <HI>People,</HI> &s;o mi|&s;erable, as tho&s;e who live under the Dominion of the <HI>Pope:</HI> mo&s;t of the <HI>States of Italy,</HI> and where there are the mo&s;t Sub&s;idies and Impo&s;itions, have not put any Tax upon <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Grain</HI> which make <HI>Bread,</HI> becau&s;e there is no Per&s;on, tho never &s;o mi&s;erable, that can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it; there is that hu|manity and regard had to the <HI>People,</HI> in not
<PB N="17" REF="8"> laying <HI>Taxes</HI> upon <HI>Bread,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis the com|mon Nouri&s;hment, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary even for the mo&s;t Indigent and Poor; tho Im|po&s;itions are laid without &s;cruple upon <HI>Wine</HI> and other Merchandi&s;es, becau&s;e they are not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as <HI>Bread:</HI> yet the <HI>Pope</HI> makes no &s;cruple to lay very great Impo&s;itions upon <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Bread,</HI> throughout all his <HI>Dominions,</HI> except in tho&s;e places that have yet pre&s;er|ved their Liberties. It was <HI>Donna Olimpia,</HI> that during the Pontificat of <HI>Innocent</HI> the X. began to put Taxes and Impo&s;ts upon <HI>Corn,</HI> and made &s;uch <HI>Laws,</HI> which have ruined the mo&s;t part of the great Nobility and Gentry, that live under the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government,</HI> who had their Revenues con&s;i&s;ting in <HI>Corn.</HI> All the <HI>Popes</HI> who have Reigned &s;ince <HI>Inno|cents</HI> time, have found &s;uch a great advan|tage to them&s;elves by the&s;e Laws of <HI>Donna Olympia,</HI> that they have continued them ever &s;ince; and it is at pre&s;ent a very con&s;iderable part of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenue. The &s;ub|&s;tance of which &s;aid <HI>Law</HI> or Ordinance is this, <HI>That no Per&s;on what&s;oever is &s;uffered to &s;ell</HI> Corn <HI>to any Strangers; but all tho&s;e that have any, are obliged to &s;ell it at a price certain to the</HI> Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Chamber; which is not above one moiety of the real Value; and then the <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Chamber</HI> &s;ells it again at double the price. In <HI>Italy</HI> there is no per&s;on either
<PB N="18" REF="9"> in City or Country, in the <HI>Popes Dominions,</HI> who is permitted to make their own <HI>Bread,</HI> but every one is obliged to buy it of the <HI>Ba|kers,</HI> who are appointed by the <HI>Chamber;</HI> in each <HI>Village</HI> and <HI>Burrough,</HI> there is but one <HI>Baker</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hed by the <HI>Chamber</HI> to make and &s;ell <HI>Bread;</HI> the <HI>Baker</HI> is obliged to take the <HI>Corn</HI> of the <HI>Chamber</HI> at a certain price, and to make the <HI>Bread</HI> of &s;uch a quality and weight, and to &s;ell it at a price certain. In the great Cities, as at <HI>Rome,</HI> there are very many <HI>Bakers,</HI> who are all obliged to buy a certain quantity of <HI>Corn</HI> of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Chamber</HI> for a whole <HI>Year</HI> to come, which they pay for before-hand, and give ten Crowns the <HI>Salme</HI> or mea&s;ure, when at the &s;ame time the <HI>Chamber</HI> bought it of the parti|cular Per&s;ons for five Crowns, at the begin|ning of the <HI>Year;</HI> all the <HI>Bakers</HI> are obliged to take the &s;ame quantity of <HI>Corn</HI> for the <HI>Year</HI> en&s;uing, altho &s;ometimes they have a great deal of the la&s;t <HI>Years Corn</HI> upon their hands, which they mu&s;t deliver to the <HI>Cham|ber</HI> for five Crowns the <HI>Salme</HI> or Mea&s;ure, and then the very &s;ame <HI>Corn</HI> is &s;old them a|gain for Ten Crowns. I do not believe that there is any Country in the World, that draws more profit from their Subjects for <HI>Corn,</HI> than the <HI>Pope</HI> doth in his <HI>Dominions,</HI> which hath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="left margin cropped or obscured" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1+ letters">een partly the Cau&s;e of the ruine of the <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical

<HEAD>Touching the Reduction of the Intere&s;t of Money Due by the <HI>MONTES</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>4.</HI> to <HI>3.</HI> per Cent.</HEAD>
<P>EVery body almo&s;t knows what 'tis which in <HI>Italy,</HI> and e&s;pecially at <HI>Rome,</HI> they call the <HI>Montes;</HI> It is much like the Rents upon the Town-Hou&s;e at <HI>Paris.</HI> The <HI>Popes</HI> having occa&s;ion of Money, borrow great Sums of particular Per&s;ons at 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> In|tere&s;t; This they call at <HI>Rome</HI> the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the <HI>Monte,</HI> that is, the Creation of certain Officers, and the a&s;&s;ignment of &s;eve|ral Rents for the payment of tho&s;e who have lent Money to the <HI>Pope.</HI> The pre&s;ent <HI>Pope,</HI> finding the <HI>Chamber</HI> engaged to the Annual Payments of I know not how many Millions of <HI>Roman Crowns</HI> Intere&s;t, to tho&s;e that had Lent Money upon the <HI>Monte,</HI> re|&s;olved in part to reduce and le&s;&s;en the great Sum of Money which the Intere&s;t amounted to, and having for this purpo&s;e rai&s;ed &s;eve|ral Milions of <HI>Roman Crowns,</HI> he acquainted tho&s;e that had Money upon the <HI>Monte,</HI> that they &s;hould come and receive their principal Money, unle&s;s they would take 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, for the 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> which they for|merly received; whereupon there being re|ally
<PB N="21" REF="10"> no Trade in all the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Terri|tories, and the Lands worth nothing, and that the E&s;tates of the Nobility were all Sold to a penny, all Per&s;ons who had Money up|on the <HI>Monte,</HI> not knowing how to Imploy it to advantage el&s;ewhere, let it there re|main, contenting them&s;elves with three <HI>per cent.</HI> in&s;tead of four <HI>per cent.</HI> which they had before. So that by this means every one concerned lo&s;t a fourth part of their yearly Income, and the <HI>Chamber</HI> got I know not how many Milions of Crowns yearly by this Retrenchment of one <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>It is almo&s;t incredible the Immen&s;e Sums the <HI>Pope</HI> hath rai&s;ed by retrenching of &s;o ma|ny &s;uperfluous Expences, and extingui&s;hing &s;everal Offices, to which great Salleries were paid by the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Chamber,</HI> and by divers other means. Tho&s;e who are well in|formed in the&s;e matters, do for certain affirm, that all the Sub&s;idies which the <HI>Pope</HI> hath re|mitted to the Emperour, and King of <HI>Poland,</HI> to carry on the War again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> are not the thirtieth part of the Money which he hath Trea&s;ured up; although likewi&s;e he hath pay'd many Debts of the <HI>Chamber,</HI> which were not very chargeable upon the <HI>Montes.</HI></P>
<PB N="22" REF="11">
<P>I ought not here to omit relating, that the <HI>Inns,</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> in <HI>Romania,</HI> and between <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> are very &s;ordid and incommodious; one may give a pretty good gue&s;s at the prodigious Wealth belong|ing to the Clergy in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> by the great quantity of Plate, Ve&s;&s;els, and Statues of Silver in the Churches, and by the Riches and Magnificent Furniture of their Habitations, and Ve&s;tments of the <HI>Prie&s;ts.</HI> One may upon the whole Matter make this Important Reflection, That if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> doth not think of &s;ome Expedient, to hinder the <HI>Clergy</HI> from Increa&s;ing their E&s;tates in Lands, which they do daily, they will in a very little time become Ma&s;ters of the greate&s;t part of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> for they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than the half of the Lands of that Kingdom, be&s;ides the other va&s;t profits they make continually under pretence of Service to the Church, for their <HI>Ma&s;&s;es, Buildings, Burials, Marriages, Confe&s;&s;ions,</HI> and by their <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and the <HI>Legacies</HI> left them by Will.</P>

<P>I know &s;everal very plea&s;ant Stories of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> at <HI>Naples.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Salerme</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="11"> gave them the Moiety of a great Hou&s;e which he had at <HI>Naples,</HI> and thereupon an In|&s;cription was Engraven in Capital Letters upon the Fronte&s;piece of the Hou&s;e, of the Donation thereof given to the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> by the &s;aid <HI>Prince;</HI> within the&s;e few years the <HI>Je|&s;uits</HI> have turn'd the <HI>Hieres</HI> of the Prince of <HI>Salerme</HI> out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the other Moiety of the &s;aid Hou&s;e, and have defaced the In|&s;cription upon the Hou&s;e; and all this they have done by Colour of Law and Ju&s;tice. Upon the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Society of <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> who are very Rich, voluntarily a&s;&s;igned them a yearly <HI>Pen&s;ion</HI> of &s;everal thou&s;and <HI>Ducats;</HI> but the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> perceiving that of late years, &s;e|veral of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> were grown mighty Rich, re&s;olved to withdraw the &s;aid <HI>Pen&s;ion;</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> hereupon went to Law with them, and obtained Sentence, that the &s;aid <HI>Pen&s;ion</HI> &s;hould be continued. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> have got a very con&s;iderable part of the Lands of the Nobility of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> All the <HI>Religious,</HI> of what Order &s;oever they be, who have Hou&s;es at <HI>Naples,</HI> have the Priviledge of purcha&s;ing all Hou&s;es that are contiguous to them on the one &s;ide or the other, to the very end of the Street, in order to make their Hou&s;es entire, and to &s;tand alone like an <HI>I&s;land;</HI> and for this purpo&s;e they have no
<PB N="24" REF="12"> more to do, than only pay the Proprietor for his Hou&s;e, not according to the pre&s;ent Value, but as it was la&s;t &s;old, perhaps 50, 60, or 100 years ago; and &s;o hath de&s;cended from Father to Son &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the per&s;on then in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Many other very con&s;iderable Remarks might be made of the divers Tricks and Me|thods the Clergy of this Kingdom make u&s;e of to Wheedle and Trapan the <HI>Laity</HI> out of their <HI>E&s;tates.</HI></P>
