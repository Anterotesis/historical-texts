<HEAD>A Treati&s;e concerning Tongues pertain|ing unto Learning.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Hebrew Tongue.</HEAD>
<P>_SUch as have delight in reading of the holy Scriptures, if they under&s;tand the Hebrew Text, they may ob&s;erve in many places &s;omething con&s;idera|ble, which in a Tran&s;lation is not al|together &s;o apparant. And whereas among Tran&s;lations there is much difference, it is therefore profitable to have the skill of this Tongue, for to be able to know which interpre|tation is according to the literall &s;ignification of the &s;aid Originall, and al&s;o how many waies the &s;ame may be taken Grammatically. And &s;eeing that many are addicted to the &s;tudy of &s;undry Languages, why &s;hould they not al&s;o unto this called the Mother of all ancient Speeches, and being in &s;ome re&s;pects the very glory of all Tongues?</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<HEAD>Of the Greeke.</HEAD>
<P>IS it not in like manner profitable to know the Text of the Go&s;pell in the Originall thereof? But the skill of Greeke is u&s;efull in mo&s;t Learnings. The com|mon Grammer of Latine cannot in every point be un|der&s;tood, without &s;ome knowledge in the Greeke. Al|&s;o a very great part of words now u&s;ed as Latine, are Greeke originally.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Latine.</HEAD>
<P>VVHo&s;o hath not &s;ome knowledge in the La|tine, cannot under&s;tand much Engli&s;h which is &s;poken and written. But he that under&s;tandeth the &s;aid Tongue, is able to read even univer&s;all Learn|ing. And to the end that men may proceed in under|&s;tanding thereof by their own private &s;tudy, I have &s;et forth &s;uch Books, as are as it were a Tutor; that when they perceive the u&s;e of them, they may without the voice of a Teacher increa&s;e ea&s;ily in the skill of the Language, and in &s;hort time may make a good progre&s;&s;e in the &s;ame. He that indifferently under&s;tandeth but the Accidence, may make the u&s;e of the &s;aid Bookes without any teaching, onely ob&s;erving the direction which is delivered in the fir&s;t of them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Chaldean.</HEAD>
<P>THere are &s;undry Chapters of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>Ezra,</HI> who&s;e Originall is not <HI>Hebrew</HI> but <HI>Chaldee.</HI> There
<PB N="3" REF="3">are al&s;o in this Tongue certain Paraphra&s;es on Hebrew holy Scripture, &s;aid to be have bin &s;et forth neer the Apo|&s;tles time, and ob&s;erved to be u&s;efull in many re&s;pects. Ancient learned Jewes have given this councell, (as <HI>Buxtorfius</HI> hath related it afore his <HI>Syro-Chaldean Lexi|con, viz.</HI> <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Ne &s;it lingua Syriaca (vel Chaldaica) vilis in oculis tuis, quia in Lege, in Prophetis, in Hagiographis invenimus, qu&ograve;d De|us &s;anctus &amp; benedictus impertiatur ei honorem: in Lege, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the Arabian.</HEAD>
<P>THe Arabick is a Tongue of great u&s;e in many parts of the world; and the knowledge of it is nece&s;&s;a|ry, for to be able to judge of the Tran&s;lations of Au|thors therein; and likewi&s;e to under&s;tand the <HI>Etymo|logie</HI> of many words thereof u&s;ed in Phy&s;ick, A&s;tro|nomy,

<HEAD>What the helpe is, which is &s;ignified to be had in the Tongues afore&s;aid?</HEAD>
<P>THe help is introduction into the knowledge of the generality of the Grammaticall Property of the &s;aid Languages, and how to make u&s;e of the Bookes requi&s;ite, al&s;o how to go on in &s;tudying Authors, and to need no more any lively voice for help in the &s;aid &s;tudy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How much time is needfull to be &s;pent unto the receiving of &s;uch a knowledge in any one of the &s;aid Tongues.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now almo&s;t forty yeers agoe, &s;ince in this City I began the &s;tudy of Introducting into the Tongues; and much experience hath taught an ea&s;ier way of Ini|tiating, than at fir&s;t was apprehended. So that &s;uch as are capable and indu&s;trious, may attaine to the afore|&s;aid mea&s;ure of under&s;tanding, in any one of the men|tioned Languages, by being taught &s;even or eight times in &s;everall daies, and &s;pending at each time two houres, and between each time copying out certaine writings, and meditating on them.</P>
<P>There have been &s;ome which have comprehended it, by being in&s;tructed but an houre at each time, and tran&s;cribing &amp;c. as is afore&s;aid.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>Once there was a Student (otherwi&s;e well learned) which de&s;ired that there might be &s;pent with him &s;e|ven or eight houres in one day, for his introduction in|to Hebrew. And at the end of the &s;aid time he acknow|ledged, that he needed no more teaching by any lively voice, but having my notes for to Copy out, he could by them and &s;uch Books as were commended to him, well enough proceed in &s;tudying the Tongue. And this need not &s;eeme unpo&s;&s;ible, whereas there have been, which by help of Books only, have attained to much skill in the &s;aid Language, and never had therein the help of any lively voice at all. Al&s;o <HI>Clenard</HI> in his Grammer doth in a manner &s;ignifie the &s;ame to be po&s;|&s;ible concerning the very Greek, the difficulte&s;t of all, where he &s;aith, <HI>Meditationes Graecanicae in artem Gram|maticam in eorum gratiam, qui viva praeceptoris voce de|&s;tituuntur, &amp; liter as Graecas &s;uo ip&s;i ductu di&s;cere coguntur.</HI></P>

<HEAD>How &s;uch are to be prepared, which de&s;ire to receive in one day &s;o much knowledge as they can in any one of the &s;aid Tongues.</HEAD>
<P>THe con&s;onants and vowels of the Hebrew, Syrian, or Arabian, are to be knowne, and their names to be learned by heart, in &s;uch order as they &s;tand in the Alphabet. Of the Greek the whole declining of the Verb <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> is to be had in memory. And of the Latine there is in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be under&s;tood, from the beginning of the Accidence unto the end of the decli|ning of the foure examples of Verbs.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HEAD>Of the be&s;t Order to be ob&s;erved in &s;tudying the &s;aid Ea&s;terne Tongues</HEAD>
<P>AS Chaldee is learned after Hebrew, &s;o is Syrian ea&s;ie&s;t apprehended after the Chaldean. Al&s;o he that under&s;tandeth the generality of the Hebrew words will &s;oone&s;t comprehend the Arabick: and meanes is now extant, whereby the greate&s;t part of the Hebrew may in &s;hort time be under&s;tood.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Rabbinicall.</HEAD>
<P>BY the name <HI>Rabbinicall</HI> there is meant what&s;oever Speech the Jewes in their Writings have u&s;ed as their own, which is not Hebrew nor Chaldee. And the &s;aid Tongue in Words, Phra&s;es, peculiar Properties Grammaticall, and in other matters is very great. Such as are un&s;een herein may with few in&s;tructions under|&s;tand how to &s;tudy a Rabbinicall writing with help of the Tran&s;lation. But afore one can well begin in a Text thereof, he is at lea&s;t to be able for to con&s;true and par&s;e readily the Hebrew P&s;alter, and to have the knowledge of the Chaldean Grammer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Concerning their learning of Hebrew, which under&s;tand not Latine.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas an Hebrew Grammer is &s;et forth, who&s;e Rules are in Engli&s;h, they which are endued with capacity for &s;uch Learning, and will be duly laborious, may &s;oone by help of the &s;aid Book, and other means which may be mini|&s;tred unto them, under&s;tand how in &s;ome Grammaticall man|ner to examine any Hebrew Text of Holy Scripture; yea and in &s;hort time to make the Hebrew Bible in a good mea&s;ure fa|miliar unto them.</P>
<P>Reward for in&s;tructing in any of the afore&s;aid Tongues is expected by the houre, that if after any time a Student con|ceiveth him&s;elf unable for progre&s;&s;e, he need not be at any more expence. <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">.</P>
