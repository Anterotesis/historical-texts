<HEAD>There was a Paper publi&s;h'd on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t, Entituled <HI>Con&s;idera|tions humbly tender'd concerning the</HI> Ea&s;t-India-Company: And the De&s;ign of it is to offer &s;ome Arguments for continuing the &s;aid <HI>Company</HI> under the pre&s;ent <HI>Charter</HI> and <HI>Management.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE two fir&s;t Paragraphs make a &s;ound of a great Regard to the <HI>Public:</HI> But 'tis indeed the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>private Intere&s;t:</HI> And whatever Pretences are now made to &s;erve a Turn at this Juncture: 'Tis notorious, That the pre&s;ent <HI>Ea&s;t-India-Stock</HI> has all along been manag'd by a <HI>few prevailing Men,</HI> who have &s;ubjected the General Concern to their particular Advantages: And more e&s;pecially for about ten Years pa&s;t, the whole matter has been made &s;ub&s;ervient to the boundle&s;s Ambition and Avarice of <HI>One A&s;piring Per&s;on,</HI> as 'tis now &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly en|deavour'd to be continu'd, by <HI>Him&s;elf,</HI> and a <HI>few Others, who have of late by his Favour been introduc'd into the Committee.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis in&s;inuated, <HI>That the di&s;&s;olving this Charter wou'd be of fatal Con&s;equence to the Na|tion, in giving our Neighbours opportunity to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all that Trade:</HI> But the direct contrary is the real Truth, for by the late mo&s;t Imprudent and Unju&s;tifiable Pro|ceedings, we have already in a manner lo&s;t all our Trade and Intere&s;t in tho&s;e Parts, which is no other way po&s;&s;ibly retrievable, but by a New Joynt-Stock firmly and legally e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd: And this too, mu&s;t be &s;peedily done, or 'twill be too late.</P>
<P>'T had been happy for the Nation in general, as well as the particular Adventurers in this pre&s;ent Stock, if the Managers had timely and faithfully acted with that great Care to prevent the Encroachments of our Neighbours, which they now &s;o zealou&s;ly pretend, whereby we might not only have &s;till been Ma&s;ters of our <HI>Spice-I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Poleroon,</HI> and continu'd our Settlement at <HI>Macca&s;&s;er,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide,</HI> The Letters from <HI>Bantam, Anno</HI> 1679. and the An&s;wer from <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1680.</NOTE> But have al&s;o at this time been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a mo&s;t important Fortre&s;s at <HI>Bantam,</HI> which that <HI>King</HI> Courted their Acceptance of, and offer'd to Contribute to the Building it. But this great Acqui&s;ition was rejected for fear of a &s;mall Ex|pence, When <HI>One</HI> of tho&s;e many <HI>Ten-Thou&s;and-Guinea's</HI> they be&s;tow'd at <HI>Court</HI> to purcha&s;e a Power to oppre&s;s their Fellow-Subjects, wou'd have defray'd the Charge of their fir&s;t Settlement, and 'twou'd not only before this time have repay'd them <HI>Twenty-fold,</HI> but been a la&s;ting and growing Trea&s;ure to the Nation, and enabl'd them for the future, to &s;tand in Competition with the <HI>Dutch</HI> as well for <HI>Empire</HI> as for <HI>Traffick.</HI> Whereas the refu&s;al thereof, has occa&s;ion'd their being driven out of the <HI>South Seas</HI> with irrepairable <HI>Lo&s;s and Shame,</HI> and gave <HI>Our Neighbours</HI> an opportu|nity to accompli&s;h an entire <HI>Dominion</HI> in all tho&s;e Parts: And yet the&s;e are the Men that now &s;et up for <HI>Public Spirited Patriots,</HI> and call them&s;elves the <HI>Con&s;ervers</HI> of the <HI>Trade of India,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Intru&s;ions of our Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>How the&s;e <HI>Managers</HI> have di&s;pos'd Affairs in other parts of <HI>India,</HI> by the <HI>Violencies</HI> they have of late committed on the Lives and Goods of the Subjects of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and the <HI>King of Siam,</HI> has been already intimated in an Ab&s;tract of tho&s;e their unju&s;tifiable Actions pre&s;ented to the <HI>High Court of Parliament;</HI> whereby it appears what great regard they have had as well to the <HI>Honour,</HI> as <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> of the Nation: For from the mo&s;t <HI>Belov'd</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pected,</HI> we are in a &s;hort time become the mo&s;t <HI>Abhorr'd,</HI> and <HI>Infamous,</HI> of all <HI>Europeans,</HI> and &s;o have lo&s;t a <HI>&s;tronger Hold,</HI> than all their <HI>Force</HI> will ever be able to regain in any of tho&s;e Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Thus do's the <HI>National E&s;teem</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> langui&s;h, and decline, under the <HI>Mal-admi|ni&s;tration</HI> of the pre&s;ent <HI>Managers</HI> of the <HI>Companies</HI> Affairs: And is it not a fit que&s;ti|on to be now ask'd by <HI>ONE of their Committee, What &s;hall we do for Saltpetre for our Wars when the Trade of</HI> India <HI>is lo&s;t?</HI> To which there is only this an&s;wer to be made him, <HI>That if the Government do's not effectually and &s;peedily interpo&s;e and &s;ettle our Trade on a good Bottom, and in a method that may be more National:</HI> We &s;hall &s;oon find our great want of that, and all things el&s;e we us'd to be &s;upply'd with from tho&s;e Parts, when 'tmay be too late to recover the Lo&s;s.</P>
<PB REF="2">
<P>But 'tis pretended, there will &s;o many Difficulties occur in the changing <HI>This,</HI> for a <HI>New Company,</HI> that renders it impracticable.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, 'tis &s;aid, <HI>That the New Adventurers will be a great while at a Stop and Nonplus.</HI> And this is in one &s;en&s;e true; For 'tis certain 'twill require &s;ome time, with much prudent Care, and Study, to regain that good Re&s;pect and Credit which the late Mi&s;carriages have ju&s;tly Forfeited: But if 't be meant that there wou'd want others of as good <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> as the <HI>pre&s;ent Managers,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Conduct of Affairs: 'Tis a groundle&s;s Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>But <HI>what rea&s;onable Compen&s;ation can be made to the pre&s;ent Company for their dead Stock, Forts, Ca&s;tles, Arms, Ammunition, and Priviledges?</HI> Why ju&s;t the &s;ame as they made to the Company that preceded them: For this now in being <HI>(if any there be)</HI> is the &s;ixth or &s;eventh <HI>Joynt-Stock,</HI> &s;ince our Nation fir&s;t engag'd in Adventures to <HI>India;</HI> And &s;o the adju|&s;ting of tho&s;e things is chalk'd out to us by &s;everal Pre&s;idents: And here it aptly falls in, to remind them, that are &s;o brisk in exacting whatever they can any way lay claim to: <HI>That they al&s;o bethink them&s;elves of di&s;charging all their own great Debts, and re&s;tore tho&s;e va&s;t Sums they have &s;o unlawfully taken, both from their Fellow-Subjects and Foreigners.</HI></P>
<P>There is in the Paper another little Hint or two of no <HI>material Concern;</HI> And &s;ome &s;uperci|lious Reflections on <HI>Interlopers</HI> which may be con&s;ider'd at better lei&s;ure: While the &s;ole intent of this, is to detect the <HI>Fallacy</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Popular Notions</HI> that are at this time with &s;uch great Indu&s;try di&s;&s;eminated; And to a&s;&s;ert this important Truth; <HI>That no Man who has a right Cognizance of the Affair, can be a True Friend to his Country, and at the &s;ame time endeavour the Continuance of this</HI> Ea&s;t-India-Company <HI>under the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution and Management.</HI></P>
