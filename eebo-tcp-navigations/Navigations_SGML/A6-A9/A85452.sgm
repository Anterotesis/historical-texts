<P>Yet further &s;ee the great and noble Acts of Chri&s;t toward this his wandering people, feeling againe the &s;carcity of foode, and being con&s;trained to come to a &s;mall pittance daily, the Lord to provide for them, cau&s;eth the Deputy of <HI>Ireland</HI> to &s;et forth a great Ship unknowne to this people, and indeed &s;mall rea&s;on in his own apprehen&s;ions why he &s;hould &s;o do (but Chri&s;t will

The chiefe Leaders of the Engli&s;h made &s;ome little &s;tand before they offered to enter, but yet boldly they ru&s;hed on, and found the pa&s;&s;ages guarded at each place with an Indian Bow-man, ready on the &s;tring, they &s;oone let fly, and wounded the for&punc; mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h in the &s;houlder, yet having di&s;patch'd the Porters, they found the winding way in without a Guide, where they &s;oone placed them&s;elves round the Wigwams, and according to direction they made their fir&s;t &s;hot with the muz|zle of their Muskets downe to the ground, knowing the Indian manner is to lie on the ground to &s;leep, from which they being in this terrible manner awakened, unle&s;&s;e is were &s;uch as were &s;laine with the &s;hot.</P>

of the Souldiers think the Devil was in them, for there were &s;ome <HI>Powwowes</HI> among them, which work &s;trange things, with the help of Satan. But this was very remarkable, one of them being wounded to death, and thru&s;t thorow the neck with a halbert; vet after all, lying groaning upon the ground, he caught the halberts &s;peare in his hand, and wound it quite round. After the Engli&s;h were thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this fir&s;t victory, they &s;ent their pri&s;oners to the pinnaces, and pro&s;ecute the warre in hand, to the next Battalia of the In|dians, which lay on a hill about two miles di&s;tant, and indeed their &s;toute&s;t Souldiers were at this place, and not yet come to the fort; the Engli&s;h being weary with their night worke, and wanting &s;uch refre&s;hing as the pre&s;ent worke required, began to grow faint, yet having obtained one victory, they were very de&s;irous of another: and further, they knew right-well, till this cur&s;ed crew were utterly rooted out, they &s;hould never be at peace; therefore they marched on toward them. Now a&s;&s;uredly, had the Indians knowne how much weakned our Souldiers were at pre&s;ent, they might have born them downe with their multitude, they being very &s;trong and agile of body, had they come to handy-gripes; but the Lord (who would have his people know their work was his, and he onely mu&s;t order their Coun&s;els, and war like work for them) did bring them timely &s;upply from the ve&s;&s;els, and al&s;o gave them a &s;econd victory, wherein they &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ew many more of their e|nemies, the re&s;idue flying into a very thick &s;wamp, being unac|ce&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of the boggy holes of water, and thick bu&s;hes; the Engli&s;h drawing up their company beleagered the &s;wamp, and the Indians in the mean time skulking up and down, and as they &s;aw opportunity they made &s;hot with their Arrowes at the Engli&s;h, and then &s;uddainly they would fall flat along in the wa|ter to defend them&s;elves from the retalliation of the Souldiers Muskets. This la&s;ted not long, for our Engli&s;h being but a &s;mall number, had parted them&s;elves far a&s;under, but by the providence of the mo&s;t high God, &s;ome of them &s;pyed an Indian with a kettle at his back going more inwardly into the &s;wamp, by which they perceived there was &s;ome place of firm land in the mid&s;t thereof, which cau&s;ed them to make way for the pa&s;&s;age

of their Souldiers, which brought this warre to a period: For al|though many got away, yet were they no &s;uch con&s;iderable num|ber as ever to rai&s;e warre any more; the &s;laine or wounded of the Engli&s;h were (through the mercy of Chri&s;t) but a few: One of them being &s;hot through the body, neere about the brea&s;t, re|garding it not till of a long time after, which cau&s;ed the bloud to dry and thicken on eitheir end of the arrow &s;o that it could not be drawne forth his body without great difficulty and much paine, yet did he &s;cape his life, and the wound healed. Thus the Lord was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t his people in this warre, and deliver them out of the Indians hands, who were very lu&s;ty proper men of their hands, mo&s;t of them, as may appear by one pa&s;&s;age which I &s;hall here relate: thus it came to pa&s;&s;e, As the Souldiers were uppon their march, clo&s;e by a great thicket, where no eye could penetrate farre, as it often falls out in &s;uch weari&s;om wayes, where neither men nor bea&s;t have beaten out a path; &s;ome Souldiers lingering behinde their fellowes, two Indians watching their opportunity, much like a hungry hauke, when they &s;up|po&s;ed the la&s;t man was come up, who kept a double double double di&s;tance in his march, they &s;udden and &s;wiftly &s;natched him up in their tallens, hoi&s;ing him upon their &s;houlders, ran into the &s;wamp with him; the Souldier unwilling to be made a Pope by being borne on mens &s;houlders, &s;trove with them all he could to free him&s;elfe from their hands; but, like a carefull Comman|der, one Captaine <HI>Davenport,</HI> then Lieutenant of this company, being diligent in his place to bring up the reare, coming up with them, followed with &s;peed into the &s;wamp after him, having a very &s;evere cutlace tyed to his wri&s;t, and being well able to make it bite &s;ore when he &s;et it on, re&s;olving to make it fall foul on the Indians bones, he &s;oone overtook them, but was preven|ted by the buckler they held up from hitting them, which was the man they had taken: It was matter of much wonder to &s;ee with what dexterity they hurled the poore Souldier about, as if they had been handling a <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> &s;hield, &s;o that the nimble Captaine <HI>Davenport</HI> could not, of a long time, fa&s;ten one &s;troke upon them; yet, at la&s;t, dying their tawny skin into a crim&s;on co|lour, they ca&s;t downe their prey, and ha&s;ted thorow the thic|kets for their lives. The Souldier thus redeemed, had no &s;uch

hard u&s;age, but that he is alive, as I &s;uppo&s;e, at this very day: The Lord in mercy toward his poore Churches having thus de|&s;troyed the&s;e bloudy barbarous Indians, he returnes his people in &s;afety to their ve&s;&s;els, where they take account of their pri&s;o|ners: the <HI>Squawes</HI> and &s;ome young youths they brought home with them, and finding the men to be deeply guilty of the crimes they undertooke the warre for, they brought away onely their heads as a token of their victory.

This people gathered into a Church, and called to office Mr. <HI>Peir&s;on,</HI> who continued with them about 7, or 8. yeares, and then he, with the greate&s;t number of the people, removed farther into the I&s;land; the other part that remained invited Mr. <HI>Foor|dum,</HI> and a people that were with him, to come and joyne with them, who accordingly did, being wandered as far as the Dutch plantation, and there un&s;ettled, although he came into the Coun|try before them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Of the endeavours of this people of Chri&s;t, to inlarge his King|dom the world throughout, and first of their preaching Chri&s;t to the Indians, among whom they live.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e brood of Travellers having thus through the good hand of their God upon them, thus &s;etled the&s;e Churches, according to the in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, and not by the will of man; they now endeavour to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to others: The reverend Mr. <HI>Hugh Peters,</HI> and his fellow-helper in Chri&s;t Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> &s;teered their cour&s;e for England, &s;o &s;oon as they heard of the chaining up of tho&s;e biting bea&s;ts, who went under the name of &s;piritual Lords; what a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t found there by their preach|ing, is &s;ince clearly manife&s;ted; for the Lord Chri&s;t ha|ving removed that u&s;urping power of Lordly Prelates, hath now inlarged his Kingdom there, and that not one|ly by the means of the&s;e men, but by divers others, both godly and eminent &s;ervants of his, who never &s;aw New-England; and by divers other godly Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who have &s;ince gone from hence, both young Students and others, to the number of twenty, or thereabout, in the whole; be&s;ides &s;ome who were eminent in the civil Go|vernment here, both gracious and godly &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, and &s;ome who have been Magi&s;trates here, to the number of five or &s;ix, the Lord Chri&s;t grant they may all endeavour the advancement of his truths, both in Churches and ci|vil Government: But before the Author cea&s;e to &s;peak of England, he is bold to &s;ay, that the Lord Chri&s;t will overturn, overturn, overturn, till he hath cau&s;ed &s;uch a Go|vernment to be &s;et up, as &s;hall become nur&s;ing fathers to his new-planted Churches.</P>
<P>The Indian people in the&s;e parts at the Engli&s;h fir&s;t com|ing, were very barbarous and uncivilized, going for the mo&s;t part naked, although the country be extreme cold
<PB N="227" REF="115">
cold in the winter-&s;ea&s;on: they are onely clothed with a Deers skin, and a little bit of cloth to cover their privy part. The Wo|men for the mo&s;t part are very mode&s;t, although they go as naked as the Men: they are generally very laborious at their planting time, and the Men extraordinary idle, making their &s;quawes to carry their Children and the luggage be&s;ide; &s;o that many times they travell eight or ten mile with a burden on their backs, more fit|ter for a hor&s;e to carry then a woman. The men follow no kind of labour but hunting, fi&s;hing and fowling, in all which they make u&s;e of their Bowe and Arrowes to &s;hoot the wilde creatures of the Trees, as Squirrells, gray and black Rockoones: as for Deer, they ordinarily catch them in traps, with a pole bent down, and a Cord at the end, which flyes up and &s;tayes their ha&s;ty cour&s;e. <HI>Bever, Otter,</HI> and <HI>Moo&s;e</HI> they catch with Traps al&s;o: they are very good marks-men, with their Bowe and Arrows. Their Boyes will ordinarily &s;hoot fi&s;h with their Arrowes as they &s;wim in the &s;hallow Rivers, they draw the Arrow halfe way putting the point of it into the water, they let flye and &s;trike the fi&s;h through; the like they do to Birds le&s;&s;er and great: onely the <HI>Gee&s;e</HI> and <HI>Turkies</HI> being &s;trong of wing, &s;omtimes flee away with their Arrowes &s;ticking in them; this is all the trade they u&s;e, which makes them de&s;titute of many rece&s;&s;aries, both in meat, drink, ap|parell and hou&s;es.</P>
<P>As for any religious ob&s;ervation, they were the mo&s;t de&s;titute of any people yet heard of, the Divel having them in very great &s;ubjection, not u&s;ing craft to delude them, as he ordinarily doth in mo&s;t parts of the World: but kept them in a continuall &s;lavi&s;h fear of him: onely the <HI>Powawes,</HI> who are more conver&s;ant with him, then any other, &s;ometimes recover their &s;icke folk with charmes, which they u&s;e, by the help of the Divell; and this makes them to adore &s;uch; one of them was &s;een as is reported to cure a Squaw that was dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, by taking a &s;nakes skin and winding it about her arm the which &s;oon became a living &s;nake crawling round about her armes and body; another cau&s;ed the &s;ick patient for healing, to pa&s;s bare footed through many burning coals; tho&s;e that cannot cure them, they call Squantams powwons: but if the patient live, he is had in great admiration, and then they cry, Much winnit Abbamocho, that is, very good
