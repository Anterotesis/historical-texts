<HEAD>The Midnights watch.</HEAD>
<P>_THe harmle&s;&s;e &s;pirit and the merry, commonly knowne to the world by the name of <HI>Robin Good-fellow,</HI> having told his Fairy mi&s;tre&s;&s;e of fleering upon &s;trangers Elves, and the tickling of her no&s;e with her petulant finger, and receaving but frownes for his favours and checks for his coun|&s;ailes he grew weary of her &s;ervice, and being as light of love as he was of care he re&s;olved to vi&s;it her no more. The troubles and commotions in the upper world had wrought his thoughts another way, and in a &s;erious humour one night he re&s;olved to goe abroad, to ob&s;erve the new cour&s;es and alterations of the world.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place he came at was Wind&s;or, where he found a good part of the Army newly come from Redding, he heard them talke as confi|dent of victory as if they had killed the Cavaliers already, he much ad|mired the under&s;tanding and re&s;olution of their Generall, and da|ring not &s;tay there any longer for feare he &s;hould be taken for a Malig|nant and be whipt, he made a &s;wift di&s;patch for Oxford, yet not farre from Wind&s;or he met at the townes end many Sentinells and incounte|red &s;ome Courts of Guard, though they were men of warre he heard them much to de&s;ire peace, and freezing in the cold, <HI>Robin</HI> could not chu&s;e but laugh, to heare them comfort one another by boa&s;ting in what hot &s;ervice they had been.</P>
<P>When he came to Oxford, the fir&s;t place he ventured into was St. <HI>Maries</HI> Church, where indeed he found a Convocation of many reve|rend heads, &s;ome whereof had lately departed from London for their con&s;ciences &s;ake, and e&s;teemed the freedome of their minds of a greater
<PB REF="3">con&s;equence then their Revenues: they much lamented the iniquity of the times, and wi&s;ht indeed (if they could be found) that abler and more learned men might &s;upply their de&s;erted places. <HI>Robbin</HI> wondred at the gravity of the men, who with great wi&s;dome and moderation were di&s;|cour&s;ing among&s;t them&s;elves from whence the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the&s;e di|&s;tempers did ari&s;e, and &s;ome imputing it to this, and &s;ome to that, <HI>Rob|bin</HI> departing from them three times, &s;neezed out aloud, Bi&s;hop, Bi|&s;hop, Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>From thence he came to Chri&s;tchurch where he found a pack of cunning heads a&s;&s;embled together, the&s;e were men of another temper, and indeed they were the <HI>ottachou&s;ticons</HI> of the Kings, Who whi&s;pered into his &s;acred eares all the ill coun&s;ells that they had contrived, Tho&s;e were they that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with impo&s;&s;ible things, and induced him to believe them. They would tell him of great battels which were ne|ver fought, wherein he had the victory, and &s;ome conque&s;ts were told him to be atchieved by the Parliament wherein he received no lo&s;&s;e at all. A band or two of men, have pa&s;&s;ed for a whole Army, and a Liter on the <HI>Thames</HI> for a whole fleet at Sea. <HI>Robbin</HI> much wondred that they being &s;o neare unto him the influence of &s;o Sacred a Maje&s;ty could work no better impe&s;&s;ion in their &s;oules; and drawing neare unto the bed chamber he found His Maje&s;ty though in the&s;e di&s;tracted times yet full of native con&s;tancy, and tranquillity of mind, and &s;ecured better by his innocence then his Guard. With much Joy and Renowne he departed thence, and ob&s;erving as he went (for it was pa&s;t midnight) many a loo&s;e wench, in the armes of many of the Cavaliers, he gave every wench as he pa&s;&s;ed by a blue and &s;ecret nip on the arm without awake|ning her. He heard among&s;t the Sentinells, as he was departing from <HI>Oxford</HI> of a great victory obtained by one Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> again&s;t a part of the Parliaments forces, wherein the Earle of <HI>Stamfords</HI> regi|ments were &s;aid to be quite routed, many of his Souldiers &s;laine, many taken pri&s;oners and great &s;tore of Armes, and Ammunition with them, among&s;t which a great bra&s;&s;e piece on which the Crown and the Ro&s;e were &s;tampt, was mo&s;t remarkable. <HI>Robbin</HI> had a great de&s;ire to go thi|ther
<PB REF="3">him&s;elf, and to ju&s;tifie the truth of &s;o ab&s;olute a Victory. He had not gone as farre as <HI>Eu&s;ham,</HI> but he e&s;pied the nine Mu&s;es in a Vinten ers Porch crouching clo&s;e together, and defending them&s;elves as well as they could from the cold vi&s;itation of the Winters night. They were extream poore, and (which is mo&s;t &s;trange) in &s;o &s;hort an ab&s;ence and di|&s;tance from <HI>Oxford</HI> they were grown extreamly ignorant, for they took him for their <HI>Apollo,</HI> and craved his Power and Protection to &s;upport them. <HI>Robbin</HI> told them they were much mi&s;taken in him, for though he was not mortal he was but of middle birth no more then hey, they be|ing the daughters of Memorie, &amp; he the &s;on of Mirth, but he bade them take comfort for that now in <HI>Oxford</HI> there was &s;ure news of Peace and a &s;peedy hope of their return to their di&s;continued habitations: at this they &s;eemed with much Joy to rou&s;e up them&s;elves, and did a&s;&s;ure him that if what he reported did prove true, they would &s;ing his prai&s;es throughout all generations. The Elf proud of &s;uch a favour in the name of <HI>Oberon</HI> did thank them, and did conjure them to perform it, and in the twinkling of an eye he conveyed him&s;elf to <HI>Salt-A&s;h</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where Sir <HI>R. Hoptons</HI> forces were quartred. He found the defeat given to the Earle of <HI>Stamford</HI> nothing &s;o great as Fame in <HI>Oxford</HI> confirmed it to be. Collonell <HI>Ruthens</HI> regiment indeed was &s;orely &s;haken, and &s;ome of his men &s;lain, and many taken pri&s;ones. With a curious eye he ob|&s;erved what Arms and Ammunition were taken, and above all he had a labouring de&s;ire to &s;ee the bra&s;&s;e piece with the Crowne and the Ro&s;e on it, which &s;o much dignified his conque&s;t: he &s;earched up and down the Army, and in and about the Magazine but he could not find it. At length de&s;pairing of what he looked for, the venterous Elfe came into Sir <HI>Ralphs</HI> chamber, and finding him a&s;leepe, and &s;afe as Wine and In|nocence, he dived into his pocket, and the fir&s;t thing he took out, hee found to beare the impre&s;&s;ion of the Ro&s;e and Crowne, and it was a brave piece indeed, for it was a farthing token which was all peradven|ture that was in it. <HI>Robbin</HI> a&s;hamed to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;o deluded could not at the fir&s;t but &s;mile at the conceit, and putting it into its Magazine re|penting him&s;elf of his journey, he did &s;wear that he would never tru&s;t
<PB REF="4">Fame, nor Pamphlet more, though printed in a thou&s;and Univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>From thence with much indignation, and more &s;peed he flung away, and in a moment placed him&s;elfe at Bri&s;toll, where he found the face of things ju&s;t like the aire of an April morning, it &s;miled and it rained both at once, &s;ome were greedy of peace, and &s;ome againe were as ea|ger of war; here &s;ome &s;tood for the King, there others for the Parlia|ment, the greater number was for the one &s;ide, but the better for the other. The husband was divided again&s;t the wife, the &s;i&s;ter again&s;t the brother, and the &s;on lifting forbidden hands again&s;t the father. <HI>Robin</HI> beholding &s;o &s;trange a divi&s;ion among&s;t people &s;o neer in blood, wi&s;hed him&s;elfe againe in Fairy Land; for &s;aid he, we have no &s;uch dinne, no &s;uch tumults, nor unnaturall quarrels, but all &s;ilence and oblivion and a perpetuall peace. And quickly abandoning the place, he in an in&s;tant came into <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> to a Towne called <HI>Tedbury,</HI> where the more to increa&s;e his mi&s;ery he met with the &s;pirit of faction and di&s;tempered zeale. This was the &s;pirit that was accu&s;tomed to make a great hubbub in the Churches to teare off the Surplice from the Mini&s;ters &s;houlders, and when the children were to be &s;igned with the &s;igne of the Cro&s;&s;e (like a Divell di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed) to teare him&s;elfe for fury, and with great noy&s;e and foaming to runne out of the Temple. This &s;pirit would faine have per&s;waded <HI>Robin</HI> to turne <HI>Roundhead,</HI> and told him that they were the be&s;t &s;ort of Chri&s;tians: I, replyed <HI>Robin,</HI> that is even as true as God is in <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> As he was proceeding in his di&s;cour&s;e, he was inter|cepted by a great noy&s;e and tumult of people, who cried out, flye, flye, flye. Amazed at the &s;uddenne&s;&s;e of the cry, and the multitudes of the people that came thronging by; he looked about him to under&s;tand what the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was, he found it a company of people, whom flying from <HI>Cirence&s;ter,</HI> the ignorant fury of the &s;word had &s;pared. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had newly entred the Towne, and having thrice &s;ummoned it, and they refu&s;ing to yeeld it into his hands, he &s;eized on it by violence, and on his fir&s;t entrance he burned a great part of the Towne, the &s;hot from the windowes by the Muskets of the Towne did wonderfully an|noy his men, and he found no better meanes to prevent that mi&s;chiefe,
<PB REF="4">but by &s;etting fire on the hou&s;es, there was a great overthrow, and Colonell <HI>Carre,</HI> and Colonell <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> two chiefe Commanders for the Parliament, were either &s;laine, or de&s;perately wounded. <HI>Robin</HI> found this Prince to be a Gentleman of him&s;elfe of a civill and &s;erious di&s;po|&s;ition, a man few in words, and very little beholding to Fame for the many &s;trange reports he had delivered of him; affrighted at the thun|der of his Armes, <HI>Robin</HI> di&s;patched him&s;elfe from him with as much &s;peed as the bullets flew from the mouth of his angry Canons, and on the fir&s;t &s;ummons of the Cocke hee came to <HI>Newarke,</HI> where either through feare of &s;ome new de&s;igne upon them, or through &s;ome great cold they had taken, he found every man of the Earle of <HI>Newca&s;tles</HI> garri&s;on &s;ouldiers to be ficke of a Pal&s;ey: loath to continue among&s;t tho&s;e cra&s;ie people, with an invitive di&s;patch hee came to <HI>Pontefract,</HI> where he found the Earle of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> with the greate&s;t part of his Ar|mie gone towards <HI>Yorke,</HI> not &s;o much through feare as it was &s;ugge&s;ted, but for complement rather, and to entertaine the Queene of <HI>England,</HI> who was expected to be either at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> or at <HI>Yorke.</HI> He found the Army of the Recu&s;ants, though in many combats &s;haken and &s;cattered, yet not to receive &s;o great an overthrow as many tongues too credu|lou&s;ly have voiced it.</P>
<P>Neither did he find in <HI>York</HI> Ma&s;&s;e to be &s;aid in every Church, it being cro&s;&s;e to the method of the clo&s;e and &s;ubtill generation of the Papi&s;ts to make a publick profe&s;&s;ion of their Religion before they had fully perfected their intentions and by the &s;trength of Authority made both the ends of their de&s;ignes to meet together. How&s;oever it being di&s;|covered that the Warre which was pretended, for the maintaining of the Kings Prerogative tended now indeed to the innovation of Religi|on, and to make the Papi&s;ts appeare the Kings be&s;t Subjects, it hath turned many hearts and armed many hands again&s;t them. The newes of the Queens landing made <HI>Robbin</HI> &s;o brisk, and &s;o overcharged him with newes, that being as unable to contain it, as he was greedy to receive it, he could not take a full &s;urvay of Yorke, nor had the lei&s;ure to go unto <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> to di&s;cover what good &s;ervice tho&s;e foure &s;hips have done to
<PB REF="5">hinder any malignant ve&s;&s;ells that come either from <HI>Holland</HI> or from <HI>Denmark</HI> from landing at Newca&s;tle; a mad vagary tooke him to come up to <HI>London,</HI> which the vagabond el&s;e performed with &s;uch a &s;udden|ne&s;&s;e, that could he be di&s;covered in his way, he would have proved rather the object of the memory then of the eye. The fir&s;t place hee came into, it was a Conventicle of the Family of Love, it was then much about two of the clock in the morning, and the Candles being put out, they were going from one exerci&s;e unto another. <HI>Robbin</HI> pre&s;ented him|&s;elf before them all, and &s;eemed lu&s;ty as the &s;pirit of youth when it is newly awakened from the mornings &s;leep; the women were well con|tented to &s;tay, but the men cryed out, a Satyre, a Satyre, a Satyre, and thru&s;ting them before them all tumbling headlong down the &s;taires to|gether, they left him laughing to him&s;elf alone.</P>
