<P>SIr <HI>Henry Hide</HI> (late Agent for the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Emperour of <HI>Turkie</HI>) having for the&s;e two years la&s;t pa&s;t, been very active in forrein Countries, for the advancing of his Ma&s;ters prerogative and power again&s;t the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and al&s;o endeavouring (what in him lay) to ob&s;truft all tra|ding and commerce between the Engli&s;h Marchants, and others; and in order thereunto, &s;ome time he &s;pent at <HI>Smerney</HI> in <HI>Turkie,</HI> for the better accompli&s;h|ing thereof; but finding his negotiations and con&s;ul|tations to be no way feacible, he rode from thence to the city of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;oliciting the Vice-Roy a|bout many things of great and dangerous con&s;e|quence; but the Marchants (occa&s;ioned by many fears and jealou&s;ies) having made a great di&s;covery
<PB N="2" REF="3">of his de&s;ign; and being likewi&s;e informed that he was determined to &s;eize and &s;ecure their &s;hips, &amp;c. for the u&s;e and &s;ervice of his Ma&s;ter; they immediat|ly re&s;olved to &s;end forth a con&s;iderable party to in|tercept him in his return from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Smer|ney;</HI> which accordingly they did (to his great a&s;to|ni&s;hment) and brought him aboard the <HI>Dragon,</HI> tran|&s;porting the &s;aid Sir <HI>Henry</HI> from thence to <HI>London,</HI> where by &s;pecial authority, and command from the Parliament, he was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower; and after few dayes, brought to a Tryal before the High Court of Ju&s;tice in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, and by Them adjudged guilty of high Trea&s;on again&s;t the Com|mon-wealth of <HI>England;</HI> receiving this Sentence of Death, <HI>To have his head &s;evered from his &s;houlders at the Old Exchange, London, on Tue&s;day the fourth of March</HI> 1651. which accordingly was performed, in the pre|&s;ence of many thou&s;and &s;pectators; the manner whereof, together with his Speech, Prayer, and De|portment, in effect, followeth.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day being the 4 of this in&s;tant, Sir <HI>Henry Hide</HI> was brought from the Tower, in a Coach, to the place of execution, being guarded with a Troop of hor&s;e, and accompanied by the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and the Lieutenant of the Tower; when he came upon the Scaffold, he put off his hat to the &s;pectators, de|porting him&s;elf with great cheerfulne&s;&s;e, and un|dantedne&s;&s;e of &s;pirit: then turning him&s;elf about, he de&s;ired to &s;ee his Coffin, which was accordingly &s;hewed him, a black mourning cloth being al&s;o pre|pared to cover the &s;ame.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Good People,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur coming hither to day is to behold a &s;ad &s;pectacle, where you may apparently di&s;cern an Object of pity; I am by a law condemned to die, and I thank my God that hath appointed me this death for mine offence, for I have alwayes lived a &s;in|ner, and offended my God, for which I humbly im|plore and de&s;ire a general remi&s;&s;ion and forgivene&s;&s;e. I am come hither to pay the wages of death, and to &s;acrifice my life for my obedience and loyalty to my Ma&s;ter the King, for who&s;e &s;ake, I was ever wil|ling to adventure both life and fortunes. But as for tho&s;e things laid to my charge, of having a de&s;ign again&s;t the Engli&s;h Marchants, I here prote&s;t my innocency thereof; neither did ever the lea&s;t thought of evil or prejudice ari&s;e within my brea&s;t, again&s;t this my Native Countrey of England; but alwayes de&s;ired its pro&s;perity and happine&s;&s;e; under a quiet and peaceable Government, &amp;c. Much more was &s;aid to this purpo&s;e, and delivered with great ap|plau&s;e and earne&s;tne&s;&s;e of &s;pirit to the &s;pectators: Having ended his &s;peech, he turned him&s;elf about to Sheriff <HI>Tichburn,</HI> who was all in mourning, and after &s;ome queries and an&s;wers, uttered many divine and excellent expre&s;&s;ions; de&s;iring them to joyn in pray|er with him; and kneeling upon his coffin, with his hat in his right hand, and his black mourning gloves in the left, mo&s;t fervently be&s;ought the Lord by prayer, humbly &s;upplicating him&s;elf before his Di|vine Maje&s;ty, in manner and form as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>His immediate and fervent Prayer before his Execution.</HEAD>
<P>O Lord Je&s;us, which art the onely health of all men living, and the e|verla&s;ting life of them which dy in thee; I wretched &s;inner do &s;ubmit my &s;elf wholy to thy ble&s;&s;ed Wil; and being &s;ure that that thing cannot peri&s;h which is committed to thy mercy; willingly now I leave this frail and wicked fle&s;h, in &s;ure hope that thou wilt mo&s;t glori|ou&s;ly re&s;tore it to me again at the la&s;t day, in the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t: I be&s;eech thee mo&s;t merciful God, that thou wilt by thy grace make &s;trong my faith again&s;t all temptations, and defend me with the buckler of thy mercy a|gain&s;t all the a&s;&s;aults of Satan. I &s;ee, and know, that there is no hope of &s;alvati|on, but by Thee, O God, and thy Son,
<PB N="5" REF="4">the Saviour of the World, into who&s;e hands I recommend my &s;pirit; for my confidence and tru&s;t is in thy mo&s;t merciful goodne&s;s: O Lord, I have no merits, nor good works, that I may al|ledge before thee: Of &s;ins and evil works (alas) I &s;ee a great heap; but yet through thy mercy, I tru&s;t to be in the number of them, to whom thou wilt not impute their &s;ins; but receive them as inheritors of thy everla&s;ting king|dome. O thou &s;weet Je&s;us of Heaven, that wa&s;t born for my &s;ake, and gave&s;t thy mo&s;t precious bloud to be &s;hed upon the Cro&s;s for my &s;ake, humbly I be&s;eech thee, in the&s;e thy &s;ufferings, gra|ciou&s;ly to vouch&s;afe an intere&s;t to me; and grant, O mo&s;t merciful Father, that when death &s;hal &s;hut up the eyes of my body, yet the eyes of my &s;oul may &s;til behold and look upon Thee;
<PB N="6" REF="5">and when Death hath taken the u&s;e of my Tongue, yet my Heart may cry, and &s;ay unto Thee, Lord into thy hands I commend my &s;oul; Lord Je&s;us receive my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Having ended his prayer, he ro&s;e from his Coffin whereon he kneeled, and turning to Sheriff <HI>Titchborn,</HI> gave him a &s;alutation: Then the Executione came to him, and asked him forgivene&s;&s;e: Sir <HI>Henry</HI> replyed, <HI>I freely forgive thee, and all mine enemies; and as a &s;ignal thereof, here's</HI> 3 l. <HI>for thee.</HI> Then the Executioner took the Block, and placed it on the Scaffold, and Sir <HI>Henry</HI> prepared him&s;elf for the &s;ame, pulling off his Cloak, Doublet, and Band, and gave them to his man; which done, he went to the block, and kneeling down, laid his neck thereon, to try how it would fit: &s;uddenly he aro&s;e again, taking his la&s;t farewel of the mini&s;ter, who came along with him, and the re&s;t of his friends; and kneeling down again the &s;econd time, the Exe|cutioner &s;pread a red Scarf over the block, de&s;iring the &s;ign; to which he an&s;wered, By the &s;tretceing forth my hands: Then, after ki&s;&s;ing the Ax and block, ca&s;ting his eyes up to heaven, earne&s;tly cryed out, Lord Je&s;us receive my &s;oul; and patiently &s;ubmit|ting to the block, immediatly gave the &s;ign, which the Executioner diligently ob&s;erving, at one blow &s;evered his head from his &s;houlders; the head mov'd three times after it was off; but neither body, hands, nor feet once &s;tir'd Pre&s;ently after the blow was gi|ven, both head and body were put into a Coffin, and &s;o carryed away from off the Scaffold.</P>
