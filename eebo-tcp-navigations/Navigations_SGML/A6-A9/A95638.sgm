<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HIis Excellency General Blake ha|ving received Adverti&s;ements of a great Fleet of &s;hips, under &s;ayl Northwards, &s;uppo&s;ed them to be Hans, de&s;igned for the relief and &s;afety of the Fle|mi&s;h Bu&s;&s;es: whereupon, Major Bourn was commanded forth with &s;even Scouts, to make a di&s;covery thereof; and coming with|in
<PB N="4" REF="3">a League of them, found them to be men of War, having their &s;treamers, Jacks, and bloudy Flags all forth; Admiral Hantz being Commander in chief, &s;elected forth Ten chief &s;hips, to give Us a revengeful &s;a|lute; which Major Bourn perceiving, pre|pared to receive them, &s;ending the Saphir back to the General, to ha&s;ten up the re&s;t: the Dutchmen being exceedingly inraged, with great fury bore up to us, with their Pendants flying, and Thunder-like their broad &s;ides they let flye; we an&s;wer'd them again, putting forth our bloudy flags in de|fiance; and in the mid&s;t of our di&s;pute, each man acting with a mo&s;t heroick mind, our General made up to us with 37 &s;ayl; which the Dutch Admiral &s;eeing, bore up with 40 &s;tout &s;hips to them; and entring battle, &s;a|luted Us with many great vollies; we rung them the like peals again; and after two ho: di&s;pute, maintained with great re&s;olution on
<PB N="5" REF="3">both &s;ides, we came to grapling, in which ac|tion the Land-&s;ouldiers performed &s;ingular &s;ervice, but was &s;everal times blown up and repelled from the Enemies decks; til at la&s;t the nimble Saphir bore up to the head of their Admiral; fired both &s;ailes and tackling, &s;hot her in the Keel; and immediatly upon the next broad &s;ide &s;unk her; at which in|&s;tant, mo&s;t of our &s;hips being engaged, the General re&s;olved to bear up, and to play the Granadoes; the which, was with &s;uch dexterity of &s;pirit attempted, that in a mo|ment 5 of their &s;hips was fir'd, which could by no means be extingui&s;h'd; 17 we took; &s;unk 9, di&s;per&s;ed, rent, and torn many of them, but not without lo&s;s; and had not the &s;able Curtains of the night prevented, we had made the victory far more glorious; but we are in pur&s;uit, &amp; have &s;ent 700 pri&s;oners to Dunbar, with &s;ome &s;hips.</P>

<P>The Lord Admiral Vantrump is come into the
<PB N="6" REF="4">Downs; where the Dutch maintained a very &s;harp di&s;pute for many hours together; and great was the lo&s;s on both &s;ides: Many gallant &s;hips being &s;unk and fired; But by rea&s;on of the great might and power of the Enemy; their number far exceeding ours; it was thought mo&s;t requi&s;ite to decline, and tack about for Dover Cliff; which we did, with ve|ry little lo&s;s: So that now we are &s;ecure, and under the protection of the Ca&s;tle; but expect every hour another engagement; which is a thing gene|rally de&s;ired both by the Sea-men and &s;ouldiers; onely it is waved for the pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on that Vice-Admiral Pen is every minute expected with a Squadron of &s;hips for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which will then compleat us 30 Sayl, gallantly man'd, and well re|&s;olved.</P>
<P>Vantrump lies three leagues di&s;tance; and is re|&s;olved forthwith to ingage Us; as captain Vand-Er&s;t informs Us, who hath de&s;erted them, and decla|red for the Parliament.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e bringeth intelligence, That the States have given Orders for the re-inforcing their Mari|tine Towns and Ca&s;tles; and have declared to the People, That our Admiral intends to land &s;ome &s;ouldiers about the Brill, and Flu&s;hing, with a Re&s;o|lution to cut down the Dammes, or Sea-walls, and
<PB N="7" REF="4">&s;o drown the Countrey. The allarum whereof hath &s;o exa&s;perated the &s;pirits of many, that they are ex|ceedingly inraged, and vowes revenge.</P>
<P>We hear that there is a general Ri&s;ing from 16 to 60; and tho&s;e that do refu&s;e to to engage, are to die without mercy. They are &s;etting forth another great Fleet of 200 &s;ail, and the Zealanders have cho|&s;en a new Admiral. In our la&s;t engagement, our lo&s;s is e&s;teemed killed and wounded about 300. The E|nemies far greater.</P>
<P>There is dayly Action between our Scouts, and Trumps; and this morning captain Peacock, with the Tyger, going to relieve the Guard, was &s;et upon by three Dutch-men, who maintained a gallant di&s;|pute, for the &s;pace of half an hour; which our Ad|miral hearing of, di&s;patched captain Wat&s;on and captain Taylor to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who bearing up clo&s;e to them, &s;aluted them with &s;everal broad &s;ides, in&s;omuch that one immediatly &s;unk by their &s;ides; the other two got off, but much batter'd and torn, as well as ours; &s;ome having their legs and armes &s;hot off; others lamentably &s;hot and mangled. We hear that General Blake hath a de&s;ign to block up the Zound, which will greatly fru&s;trate &amp; eclip&s;e their liberty, &amp;c.</P>
