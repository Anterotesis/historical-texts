<HEAD>THE BLOODY ATTEMPTS Vpon the Kingdom of <HI>IRELAND</HI> in general, and on <HI>DUBLIN</HI> in parti|cular; and how it fir&s;t began.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the three and twentieth day of October 1641. the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dublin</HI> &s;hould have beene &s;urpri&s;ed, (as at that time it might ea&s;ily have been) for there was no fear or &s;u&s;pition of Treachery, there being at that time 400. Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts elected out of mo&s;t parts of Ireland, de&s;perate per&s;ons, de&s;igned and appointed for that bloudy and de&s;perate attempt, all lodging and &s;culking in &s;everal places of the City and Suburbs, waiting and expecting the time and watch-word, when to give the on&s;et. One of their own Country-men at that time, ab|horring &s;o foul and dete&s;table a Trea&s;on, revealed it to Sir <HI>William Par&s;ons</HI> Knight and Baronet, Ma|&s;ter of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Sir <HI>Iohn Borla&s;e</HI> Knight, Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance, both Lords Ju&s;tices of the Kingdom of Ireland. The party who di&s;covered the plot, had been formerly a &s;ervant to Sir <HI>Iohn Clotworthy,</HI> but at the time when he revealed their de&s;igne, he &s;erved one Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahowne</HI> an Iri&s;hman, who lodged at
<PB REF="16"> the &s;igne of the artichoak, vulgarly called S. <HI>Ma|ries</HI> Abbey in the &s;uburbs of the City of Dublin, The &s;ervants name was <HI>Owen Mack-Connel,</HI> who being with his ma&s;ter Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahown,</HI> in a hou&s;e in Cook&s;treet, at the lodging of the Lord <HI>Mack-Gueere,</HI> al&s;o an Iri&s;hman in the City of Dub|lin. Vpon the two and twentieth of Octob. being the night before: his ma&s;ter did then and there reveal the whole plot unto him in the pre&s;ence of the Lord <HI>Mack-Gueere,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>This <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> had married an Engli&s;h woman, by whom he had children living in the County of Antrim, in the Province of Vl&s;ter, and &s;he was and is a Prote&s;tant; a&s;&s;oon as <HI>Owen Mack Connel</HI> had heard and under&s;tood the plot, and their damnable intentions, with a &s;ad countenance asked his Ma&s;ter what &s;hould become of his wife and poor children, he replyed in the&s;e words: <HI>hang her Engli&s;h Kite, we will get thee a better Wife:</HI> But the Company perceiving that his thoughts were troubled at the relation of this horrid Tra|gedy, now to be acted on the &s;tage of Ireland, that within few houres was to be in a flame of confu&s;i|on, the word to be given, that, man, woman, and child &s;hould have been butchered the next morn|ing: the poor mans heart failed him at this helli&s;h and barbarous ma&s;&s;acre, whereupon the&s;e bloody Villains, perceiving by the alteration of his coun|tenance that he approved not, or rather, like a man
<PB REF="16"> amazed, &s;tartled at &s;uch a bloody motion, as to im|brue his hands of his owne deare&s;t wife and chil|dren, and that that is more, of his owne Country and Kingdom, they began to bethink them&s;elves what to do with him; they re&s;olved to make him drunk, and thereupon enforced him unnaturally, to drink &s;o much that he could hardly drink more, yet they plyed him clo&s;e, he de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, they to give him his load powred it downe his throat, he re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch unrea&s;onable violence, there &s;teps towards him one <HI>Donal Mack-Gueere,</HI> &s;aying, will you not drink your liquor, &s;ee if you dare deny to pledge me? thereupon &s;et a pi&s;tol to his bre&s;t with two bullets, the pan being primed with powder and brim&s;tone, that &s;o it might not fail to &s;peed, twice it was offered again&s;t him, and took no fire, whereupon Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahown</HI> &s;tept in and &s;aid, <HI>let him alone, God will not &s;uffer him to be killed, he will be on our &s;ide I warrant ye.</HI> They after|wards led him from the lord <HI>Mack-Gueers</HI> lodging to Capt. <HI>Mack-Mahowns</HI> lodging, but the poor man, faining him&s;elf more drunk then he was, and taking the advantage of the time and place, wil|lingly fell down in a dirty channel, and was &s;o bemired with mud, that none would help him up, but with much adoe he crept out of the kennel, and reeled to the &s;toop of a door, and &s;ate downe to &s;leep, he &s;eeming to &s;leep, the fellow which was left with him to watch with him, departed,
<PB REF="17"> which this <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> perceiving, a&s;&s;oon as ever his back was turned, with a bold re&s;olution aro&s;e up, and went to the Marchants key in Dub|lin, between eleven and twelve of the clock at night to Sir <HI>William Par&s;ons</HI> hou&s;e, one of the Lord Ju&s;tices of Ireland, where knocking at the doore, the Porter knowing him, demanded of him what he would have, he an&s;wered he mu&s;t needs &s;peak with his Lord, the Porter replyed his Lord was in bed, It is no matter an&s;wered <HI>Owen Mack-Connel,</HI> I mu&s;t and will &s;peak with him, for my bu&s;ine&s;&s;e concerns both King and Kingdom; then the Por|ter let him in, wondring to &s;ee him in &s;uch a pic|kle, &s;till he ha&s;tened the porter, until he had called up one of his Lords Gentlemen, who got up &s;pee|dily, and went into his Lords bed-chamber, where he acquainted his Lord with the earne&s;t de&s;ire this <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> had to &s;peak with him concer|ning a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of weighty con&s;equence, but would not reveal it to any but his Honour, where|upon he was called up &amp; had acce&s;&s;e to my Lord, unto whom he di&s;covered the whole plot, which was to be executed the &s;ame morning at 9. of the clock, this being between twelve and one.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t the Lord <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> did &s;eem to &s;light it, but <HI>Owen Mack-Connel</HI> confidently affirmed the thing to be true, and withal told him thus, my lord <HI>I have di&s;charged my duty and my con&s;cience, look you to it; I will go back to my ma&s;ter, becau&s;e neither he, nor the rest &s;hall &s;u&s;pect me.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A true De&s;cription of &s;undry &s;ad and lamen|table Collections, taken from the monthes of very credible Per&s;ons, and out of Letters &s;ent from Ireland to this Citie of London, of the perfidious outrages and barbarous cru|elties which the Irish Papi&s;ts have com|mitted upon the per&s;ons of the Prote&s;tants, both men, women, and children in that Kingdom, &s;ince <HI>Anno Dom. 1641.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Iri&s;h nation is a people both proud and envious. The Commonaltie ignorant and illiterate, poor, and lazie: and will rather beg or &s;tarve, then work; and therefore fit &s;ubject for the Prie&s;ts and Ie&s;uits to &s;pur on upon &s;uch bloudy actions and murtherous de&s;ignes.</P>
<P>It is too well known that the Iri&s;h have mur|thered of the Prote&s;tant party in the provinces of Vl&s;ter, Lein&s;ter, Connaght, and Mun&s;ter, of men women, and children, the number of fifty thou|&s;and, as it is credibly reported by Engli&s;hmen, who have been over all parts of the Kingdom, and do prote&s;t upon their oaths, that there are above five thou&s;and families de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h have mo&s;t murtherou&s;ly and trayte|rou&s;ly &s;urpri&s;ed them upon great advantages, and
<PB REF="19"> without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, either of age, youth, or infancie, of young men or maids, or of old men or babes, &s;tript all to their skins, naked as ever they were born into the World, &s;o they have gone out of the World, many &s;tarved to death for want of food and rayment; the Iri&s;h have &s;hewed them no more compa&s;&s;ion, nor &s;o much as they do to their dogs.</P>
<P>At <HI>Belturbait</HI> in the County of Cavan, the Po|pi&s;h Rebels demanded the Town, on promi&s;e that if they would &s;urrender, they &s;hould pa&s;&s;e free with bag and baggage: On &s;erious con&s;iderations of the inhabitants and the Governour, they were per&s;waded to yeeld it up, which when they had done; they &s;ent about twenty or thirty to guard them; when they had guarded them &s;even miles from the Town, they &s;ei&s;ed on them, robbed all the Prote&s;tants, being between five hundred and a thou&s;and per&s;ons, men, women, and children: who &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to their mercy, found no quarter but cruelty: they &s;tript them all naked, and turned them into the open fields in bitter cold weather, not affording them one of their lowzy rags to hide tho&s;e parts which even nature com|mands to be covered.</P>
<P>In <HI>London-Derry,</HI> belonging to the Londoners, Sir <HI>Philem Oneal</HI> promi&s;ed under hand and &s;eal to let the poor Prote&s;tants pa&s;&s;e with bag and bag|gage, onely to part with their Town: yet this
