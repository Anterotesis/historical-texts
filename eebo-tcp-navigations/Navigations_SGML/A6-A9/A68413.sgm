<P>_IT hath &s;&eacute;emed to me &s;o &s;traunge and
waightie a thing (mo&s;t high &amp; migh|tie

to vndertake to write of the mo&s;t
worthy and valyaunt acts which the
<HI>Portingales</HI> haue enterpri&s;ed in the
di&s;couery and conque&s;t of the <HI>Indias,</HI>
that oftentimes I thought to giue
ouer and relinqui&s;h the &s;ame, but as the attempt and dooing
thereof was principally taken in hande for the glorye of
Almightye God, and to conuert tho&s;e barbarous Nations
to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and the great honour of your high|ne&s;&s;e,
wherein God gaue them (by his Omnipotent pow|er,

in publi&s;hing the &s;ame by writing, y&eacute;elding the
glorie thereof onely to his cele&s;tiall Godhead, and the
<PB REF="4">
prai&s;e tere&s;triall vnto your excellent highne&s;&s;e, and to
that famous and mo&s;t happie king, <HI>Don Manuel</HI> your Fa|ther.
And although the &s;ame be well knowne and &s;pread a|broad
ouer all the worlde, yet it cannot be &s;o perfectlye
publi&s;hed vnle&s;&s;e it b&eacute;e &s;et forth in writing. For by this
meanes the memorie thereof will indure for euer, becau&s;e
that the writings will alwayes &s;hew the &s;ame to b&eacute;e pre|&s;ent.
Like as it doth continue tho&s;e actes of the Gr&eacute;eks, and
of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the which long &s;ince is pa&s;t &s;o many
yeares. And therefore they lyke wi&s;e men, perceiuing the
&s;ame to be true, did trauaile all that was po&s;&s;ible to leaue
the memorie thereof by writing, and noting that the wor|thine&s;&s;e
of the &s;ame did con&s;i&s;t much in the eloquence of
the writer, did therefore choo&s;e &s;uch excellent learned men
as tho&s;e were that wrote the &s;ame, b&eacute;eing thereto aided
with much fauour and helpe, of others that were nothing
inferior vnto theyr own, &amp; po&s;&s;ible were far greater, but for
that the &s;ame did not remaine in writing, there is no me|morie

there was wonderfull greate actes done, and that
by force of Armes. Of all the which almo&s;t there hath
remayned no memorie of that there &s;houlde haue b&eacute;ene,

to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> who with theyr huge armye, and with

the which were written by men of great credite, and lyke|wi&s;e

find out &amp; di&s;couer the <HI>Indias,</HI> by commandement of a great

the Generall tolde him by the mouth of <HI>Fernan Martin,</HI>

for that as he had heard &s;aye, the people of the &s;ame are

<P>By occa&s;ion of this m&eacute;eting and fea&s;ting, the Captaine

to <HI>Calycut</HI> were nine hundred leagues, and that it was
verye n&eacute;edefull and nece&s;&s;arye for him to take a Pilot
of this Countrey, to conduct him and his Companye, by

a certaine Moore, who brought his Sonne with him being
a boye, and a&s;ked the Generall whether he woulde carrye

he &s;hould finde in the cour&s;e he &s;houlde k&eacute;epe towards <HI>Ca|lycut:</HI>
Declaring that he would gladly goe with him, and

make no peace with him, for that he was a Chri&s;tian.
The Captaine was verye gladde of the comming of this
Moore, for by him h&eacute;e d&eacute;emed, to gather &s;ufficient mat|ter

the &s;ame Moore and his Sonne into his Shippe,
and by rea&s;on it was then &s;omewhat late, and that
they had no &s;tore of water, the Generall with the

on thur&s;day, and when the night was come, they laun|ched
out their boates to go with them for water, for the Pi|lot
of <HI>Mon&s;ambicke</HI> informed the Generall, that it was

Wherevpon taking the Pilot with him, he departed about
midnight to goe thether, hauing <HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> in his co~|pany,

Being come to the place where the Pilot informed the wa|ter
to be, it could not &s;o be found, for he no doubt, went

what before he promi&s;ed, but whether that he was amazed
with imagination of e&s;cape, and &s;o could not finde it, or that
of mallice (&s;ince he could not run away) he would not finde
it, he cau&s;ed them to &s;pend that night without attaining the

would remaine no longer, hauing but a &s;mall compa|ny

armour, he retourned to &s;hore ward againe, carrieng with
him the Pilot of <HI>Mon&s;ambicke,</HI> and hauing al&s;o <HI>Nicholas

when they drew n&eacute;ere to the &s;ame, the Pilot &s;&eacute;eing that h&eacute;e

&s;hew them the water, which was harde by the &s;hore

ind&eacute;ede, that they more &s;orrowed their mi&s;&s;ing and pa&s;&s;ing
by the Iland where they informed to be Chri&s;tians, then
did our Captaine Generall: For they were verely in hope
to haue ben reuenged ther, vpon our men by death of them
all: But GOD beholding the daunger and perill meant to|wards
them, of his diuine goodne&s;&s;e and mercye deliuered
them from the &s;ame, and that by a great miracle: For if our
men had gone thether, not one of them had e&s;caped with
lyfe, &s;ince the Generall hauing &s;uch a beliefe &amp; opinion, that
there were Chri&s;tians in that Iland (as the Pilot had tolde
him) would no doubt haue gone pre&s;ently on land at his ar|riuall
there, and &s;o thereby runne headlong into a place
where he and his people &s;hould haue bene put to &s;laughter:
The Generall thus &s;orrowing the mi&s;&s;e of that Iland, for
that he &s;uppo&s;ed there to haue found Chri&s;tians, and the
Pilots Moores in chafe with them&s;elues for that they had
mi&s;&s;ed their cour&s;e thether for purpo&s;e afore &s;aid, it was then
on each part determined, to goe back and a&s;&s;aie to finde the
&s;ame: neuerthele&s;&s;e although they earne&s;tly bent them&s;elues
to attaine vnto that de&s;ired Ilande, and &s;pent that daye in
trauell to winne their purpo&s;e therein, yet coulde they not
preuaile thereto: For &s;till the winde was &s;o contrarie, and
the currents &s;o great, as doe what they could, they failed of
their wills, and were put off from arriuall there, which no
doubte was done by Gods prouidence, and of his m&eacute;ere
fauour and goodne&s;&s;e towards our men: as not willing they
&s;hould receiue anie daunger, or &s;u&s;teine crueltie, or lo&s;&s;e of

<P>_THe Generall following this voyage, did
vpon the Saterday b&eacute;eing the &s;eauenth day
of Aprill, about the going downe of the
Sunne the &s;ame daye come to an Ankor
without the Barre of the Iland of <HI>Mom|ba&s;&s;a,</HI>
which is harde by the firme lande,
and is verye plentie of victualls, that is to &s;aye, <HI>Millyo,</HI>
Rice, and Cattell, as well great as lyttle, but all well
growne and fat, chiefly their &s;h&eacute;epe, which be all without
fayles. Al&s;o they haue manye Hennes: Moreouer, the I|lande

and Cidrons, and in the &s;ame are manye excellent good
waters. In this Ilande there is a Citie, bearing the &s;elfe
&s;ame name of the Ilande, being in foure degr&eacute;es on the
South &s;ide, it is a verye great Citie, placed and &s;cituated
vppon an Hill, which al&s;o is a Rocke, wherevpon the Sea
doth beate, &s;o that it cannot b&eacute;e vndermined.</P>
<P>At the entering into the Protes or Heauen there is a
Marke: and at the enteraunce vppon the Barre, there is
planted or builded a lyttle Fort, lowe and n&eacute;ere to the wa|ter.
The mo&s;t parte of the hou&s;es in this Citie, are buil|ded
with lyme and &s;tone, with the loftes thereof wrought
with fine knottes of Plai&s;ter of <HI>Paris,</HI> the &s;tr&eacute;etes therein

They goe gallantly arayed, e&s;pecially the women, which go
apparelled in gownes of &s;ilke, and be decked and garni&s;hed
with Iewells of golde and precious &s;tones. In this Citie is
great trade of all kindes of Marchandize. There is al&s;o a
good Harbour, where alwayes are manye &s;hippes lieng at
Road, and from the firme land commeth thether great plen|tie
of Honnie, Waxe and Iuorie, the Captaine Generall
thus come to the Barre of this Citie, did not then enter
foorthwith, for that it was almo&s;t night when he came to
an Ankor. But he commaunded to put foorth the flagges,
and to toll their &s;hippes, reioycing and making great mirth,
for that their good fortune, and hope they conceyued, that
in that Ilande there dwelled manye Chri&s;tians, and that
the next daye they &s;hould heare Ma&s;&s;e on the &s;hore. Moreo|uer
they were greatly comforted, as hauing &s;uch confi|dence,
that in this place they might and woulde cure and
heale all &s;uch as were then &s;icke amonge&s;t them, as in
truth were, almo&s;t all that were there pre&s;ent, albeit in

remayned and had e&s;caped the &s;ickne&s;&s;e and di&s;ea&s;es pa&s;t,

Wherefore he &amp; his Captaines immediatly adui&s;ed them|&s;elues

next day following in the morning, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> floud being come, the

preuented that perill, and wrought their &s;afetie: For when
the Generalls &s;hip had wayed her Ankor, and was going
to enter the port, &s;he &s;trake vpon a &s;hoel that was a&s;terne
the &s;ame, which hap when he perceiued, and fearing h&eacute;e
&s;hould ca&s;t him&s;elfe away, he then forthwith commanded,
to let fall his Ankor, &amp; in like &s;ort did the other Captaines
al&s;o: which chance when the Moores that were in the &s;hips
&s;awe, &amp; that the Generall was come to an ankor, they then
imagined that during that daye, they &s;houlde not gette the
Fl&eacute;ete into the harbour, and therefore they ran to theyr
boate, which they had on the &s;hips &s;ide to goe to the Citie,
at which in&s;tant al&s;o the Pilots of <HI>Mon&s;ambicke,</HI> falling
a &s;tearne the Admirall, tooke the water, and tho&s;e of the
boate tooke them in and carried them away with them, al|though
the Generall called vnto them, requiring them to
bring backe, and deliuer them to him againe: But when he
&s;awe they would not &s;o doe, then he apparantlye perceiued
that ther was an euill meaning in their King and them, to|wards
him and his, and that it was his great goodne&s;&s;e and
<PB N="25" REF="31">
fauour to giue him cau&s;e of &s;taye, by happening vppon that
&s;hoell, thereby to pre&s;erue him from their trea&s;on imagi|ned,
and put in practi&s;e: Thus hauing declared to all his
company, the opinion he conceiued of that which then be|fore
their eyes was done, and appeared to be deui&s;ed and
wrought again&s;t them, he then commaunded the night bee|ing
come, to giue &s;ome torments or torture, to two of the
Moores, which he brought captiues with them from <HI>Mon|&s;ambicke,</HI>
thereby to &s;&eacute;e whether they had practi&s;ed any tre|&s;on,
and to inforce them to open and di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ame:
which commaundement being ob&s;erued, and put in execu|tion,
by heating and dropping of bacon vppon their fle&s;h,
they immediately confe&s;&s;ed, they had con&s;pired trea&s;on, and
that the Pilots tooke the Sea, as fearing the &s;ame had ben
di&s;clo&s;ed: wherevpon the Generall, altogether altered his
minde and purpo&s;e of going into that Harbour. Neuerthe|le&s;&s;e
being vnquiet and greatly gr&eacute;eued at their fal&s;hood, he
was de&s;irous to v&s;e lyke torture to another Moore captiue
al&s;o: to make tryall whether he were of coun&s;ell and in
con&s;ort with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But this Moore perceiuing preparation made for that
purpo&s;e, did ca&s;t him&s;elfe his hands being bound, into the
&s;ea, as in lyke manner another of them did, before it was
daye light. The &s;ecrecie of the mi&s;chiefe prepared, being
thus come to apparaunt view, and &s;o di&s;couered, the Gene|rall
gaue great thankes to God, by who&s;e only goodne&s;&s;e, he
and his company were delyuered from imminent death and
&s;laughter among&s;t tho&s;e Infidells, and therefore in contem|plation
and thankes giuing for the &s;ame, he and his com|pany
b&eacute;eing aboord the Admirall, &s;ayd the <HI>Salue Regina.</HI>
After this being mindfull of their &s;afetie, and fearing lea&s;t
the Moores would attempt &s;ome matter again&s;t them in the
night time, they therefore ordained &s;trong and diligent
watch, commaunding euerye man to watch armed: And
h&eacute;ere by the way is to be noted one thing, and that to bee
meruayled at, which is this: That when our men came
fir&s;t before the Towne of <HI>Momba&s;&s;a,</HI> all &s;uch amonge&s;t
<PB REF="32">
them as then were &s;icke, (which ind&eacute;ede were many) began
then pre&s;ently to be whole: &s;o that in this time of theyr
great nece&s;&s;itie, and daunger, they felt and found them&s;elues
&s;ound and &s;trong, which as it was pa&s;t all hope and expec|tation
of man, and farre aboue the common cour&s;e of Na|ture,
and operation of the &s;ame, &s;o the more liuely it appea|red
to be the meruailous and &s;upernaturall worke of God,
and therefore miraculou&s;ly done at this in&s;tant time of ne|ce&s;&s;itie,
when his diuine power was to be &s;&eacute;ene and exten|ded,
for the pre&s;eruation of that poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed number,
which then had their onely affiaunce in him. The watch
thus prepared and &s;et for that night, it fortuned that tho&s;e
which watched in the &s;hippe <HI>Berrio,</HI> felt the gabell of the
&s;ame wagging, whereat an Ankor lay into the Sea, and at
the fir&s;t they adiudged that the gabell had bene wagged or
&s;haken by a kinde of Fi&s;h called a <HI>Tunnie</HI> whereof ma|ny
were there about which be very great and good meate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tunnie good meate &amp; plentifull in the coa&s;t of Mo~ba&s;&s;a.</NOTE>
but giuing better and more attentiue eare thereto, they then
perceiued that their enimies were at the &s;ame, who in truth
did &s;wimme about the gabell, and were cutting of it with
their woodkniues or fawchings, and hoping or rather vere|ly
knowing, that perfourming their enterpri&s;e thereof the

diligent and warie watch, that they could not preuaile, ne|uerthele&s;&s;e

&s;hippes as they had, which if they had done, it had bene
then lykely by all coniecture of man, that they &s;hould haue

painted the picture of our Ladie at what time &s;he wept, in

&s;ayd they were of another Citie, further off called <HI>Granga|lor,</HI>

And from this time, &s;o long as our Fl&eacute;ete remayned

<P>_THe la&s;t day of the eight after Ea&s;ter, dinner
being done, the King of <HI>Mylynde</HI> came in
a great boate hard to our Fl&eacute;ete, apparelled
in a Ca&s;&s;ocke of Crim&s;on Dama&s;ke, lined
with gr&eacute;ene &s;atten, hauing vpon his head a
rich towell. He was &s;itting in a chaire, &s;uch
as was v&s;ed in olde time, very well made and wrought
with wire, being in &s;ight very faire, and in the &s;ame was
a cu&s;hion of &s;ilke, and another like vnto that hard by him,
which was couered with a hat of Crim&s;on &s;atten. There
&s;tood hard by him as his Page, an olde man, who carried a
very rich &s;word, the &s;cabered wherof was &s;iluer: he brought
with him manye Shagbuts, and two Flutes of Iuorie,
which were eight &s;pans of length each of them, they were
very well wrought, and vppon the &s;ame they played by a
little hole that is in the mid&s;t thereof, agr&eacute;eing and accor|ding
well with the &s;hagbuts. There came with the King,
about the number of twentie Moores Gentlemen all richly
apparelled. The King now being come n&eacute;ere to the &s;hips,
the Captaine generall came forth to m&eacute;ete him in his boat
well trimmed and &s;et out with all his flagges, and he him|&s;elfe
comely araied, withall his be&s;t apparell, carrieng with
him twelue of the mo&s;t principall men of his &s;hippes, his

him into his boat, the King then giuing to the Generall as
great honour &amp; curte&s;ie as though he had al&s;o ben a King:
he very earne&s;tly noted &amp; beheld him &amp; his men, as a &s;trange
&s;ight and matter to him and his people: he required the Ge|nerall
to tell him the name of his King, and being tolde, he

commaunded the &s;ame to be then pre&s;ently written: he al|&s;o

his demaund, declaring al&s;o for what cau&s;e y^e king his ma|&s;ter

into his Citie, there to take his plea&s;ure, &amp; &s;olace him&s;elf in

he would &s;o do, that afterward he in like manner would go
with him to &s;&eacute;e his &s;hips, &amp; make merry in the &s;ame, wher|vnto
the Generall aun&s;wered, that he had no licen&s;e of the

accompt &s;hould he then make to tho&s;e of his Citie, or what
might they d&eacute;eme &amp; adiudge of him therein: yet notwith|&s;tanding
he &s;aid, y^t it was a griefe to him y^t he refu&s;ed to go

King, promi&s;ed him to returne y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> way, &amp; while&s;t they were
thus talking there, did &s;end for tho&s;e Moores, which he had
taken captiues, and gaue them to the King, &s;aieng that if
he could do him any further plea&s;ure, he would gladly doe
the &s;ame: with which gift the King was &s;o content, that he
&s;aid, he did more e&s;t&eacute;eme of the &s;ame, then if he had giuen
him &s;uch another Citie as that of <HI>Mylynde</HI> was.
Now hauing ended their talke and confirmed the friend&s;hip
betw&eacute;ene them, the King then rowing among&s;t our &s;hips,
<PB REF="37">
and behelde the &s;ame, with great plea&s;ure and admiration&punc;
out of which great &s;tore of &s;hot of Ordinaunce pa&s;&s;ed,
wherewith they were greatlye delyghted, all which time
our Generall went with him, to whom he declared, that he
neuer &s;aw any men of whom he tooke &s;o great plea&s;ure, as
he did of tho&s;e of <HI>Portingall,</HI> whereof he woulde gladye
haue &s;ome with him, to helpe him in his warres, which
he hath &s;ometime with his enimies: for it well appeared
they were men apt to offend their enimie, and to abide and
&s;uffer any trauell or paine, that &s;hould happen vnto them.
To which his &s;peaches the Generall aun&s;wered, that if h&eacute;e
had experience of their doings, he woulde then a great
deale better lyke of them, and further that they would helpe
him, if the King his Ma&s;ter would &s;ende his &s;hips of warre
to <HI>Calicut,</HI> as he doubted not but he would, if it wer Gods
good plea&s;ure to permit the &s;ame to be di&s;couered. After the
King had in this &s;ort &s;olaced him&s;elf, he then de&s;ired the
General, that &s;ince he would not go with him to his Citie,
he &s;huld then let him haue two of his men to go and &s;&eacute;e his
Pallaice, and for pledge of the &s;ame, he would giue him his
&s;onne, and one of his chiefe Chaplaines, the which they call
<HI>Cacis,</HI> wherevnto the Generall y&eacute;elded and appointed two of
our men to go with the King, who at his departure, reque|&s;ted
the Generall that the next day he would goe along in
his boate hard by the &s;hore, where he &s;huld &s;&eacute;e his hor&s;men

certaine &s;tayres of &s;tone from the Kings hou&s;e, which was
in &s;ight, where they tooke the King vp in a chaire, and ca|ried
him verye n&eacute;ere to the Boate of the Generall, to
whom he &s;pake verye louing wordes, and once more re|que&s;ted
him to enter vpon land, and go to his Citie, for that
his father being a lame man, was de&s;irous to &s;&eacute;e him, and
<PB N="31" REF="37">
that while&s;t he &s;hould remaine on &s;hoare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ge|nerall vvould not con|&s;ent to go on la~d at Mylynde</NOTE> both he and his

fearing lea&s;t vnder &s;uch &s;ugred &s;peach &s;ome bitter

going on land, alleadging h&eacute;e mu&s;t obey his Prince, who
gaue him no licen&s;e or commi&s;&s;ion &s;o to do at anie time.
And &s;o taking his leaue of the king, h&eacute;e went a while hard
by the &s;hips of the <HI>Indias,</HI> &s;hooting off much Ordinaunce,
who when they &s;awe vs pa&s;&s;e by lifted vp their hands, &s;ai|eng:

our men made them a great fea&s;t, with much pa&s;time al&s;o
of Squibs, Gunne &s;hot, and great and lowde cryes. The
Fl&eacute;et thus lyeng in y^e harbour, there came vpon y^e &s;undaie
b&eacute;eing the. 21. day of Aprill, from the king, a man that was
in great credit with him, to vi&s;ite the Captaine Generall,
who at that in&s;tant was very &s;ad and heauie: for that it
was then two daies &s;ince any man came to the Fl&eacute;et from
the Citie, by rea&s;on whereof he feared lea&s;t that the king
were offended with him, as taking occa&s;ion of offence, for
that he refu&s;ed to go on &s;hoare, &s;uppo&s;ing al&s;o that he wold
therevppon, breake the peace and league made betw&eacute;ene
them, for which he was &s;orrowfull, e&s;pecially &s;ince as yet
he had no Pilots. And when he &s;awe, that he which was
&s;o great with the king, did bring him no Pilots, he then
began to haue &s;ome iealou&s;ie, and &s;u&s;pition of the king, who
being informed therof, and knowing the Generall remai|ned
there for that cau&s;e, did therefore forthwith &s;end him
a Pilot, a Gentile (called in their language <HI>Go&s;arate</HI>)
who&s;e name was <HI>Canaca,</HI> making excu&s;e that h&eacute;e had not

the very women al&s;o with their children hanging at theyr

that the &s;ame was a Church of great deuotion, which the

pillour made of wier, the which was as high as the ma&s;t of

Our Captaine was very glad to &s;&eacute;e the &s;ame, for

And for that he knew he could not &s;end the &s;ame, but that
the Factor and the Catuall &s;hould haue the ouer&s;ight ther|of,

were a Merchaunt or that his comming thether were to

no Merchaunt but an Amba&s;&s;adour, which was the cau&s;e
he brought none with him, &amp; that this which he doth now
&s;end to y^e king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> is his own goods, &amp; not y^e king his
Mai&s;ters, who for that he did not certeinly know that h&eacute;e
&s;hould haue met with the king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> did therfore giue
him nothing to pre&s;ent him withal: but at his next returne
knowing for certeintie that he &s;hall finde him, the king his
Mai&s;ter will &s;end him golde, &s;iluer, &amp; other rich things. To

the Captaine generall was very angry, and &s;aid vnto them,

immediately retourne to goe with him, &s;ince that the King
wold not be plea&s;ed that he &s;huld go without them: for &s;o
much as he was a &s;traunger, and for that there were ma|ny
Moores in the Citie. The Captaine generall giuing cre|dite

aun&s;wered them that he would tarry for their comming:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trea&s;on con&s;pired again&s;t the fleete</NOTE>

&s;aid vnto him with a &s;euere countenaunce, that he had tar|ried

him: whereof the one was in the <HI>Portingale</HI> tongue, the
other in the <HI>Arabian</HI> language. The&s;e he tolde him were
&s;ent in this order, for that the King his Ma&s;ter did not know

<P>THe next daye after, which was the la&s;t daye of

And for that the Hor&s;e came after that order, he woulde

fained pretence to lay hands vpon him and to take him pri|&s;oner,
for that they would finde occa&s;ion to kill him: and he
by this meanes &s;houlde remaine in no fault thereof at all.
And albeit that the King would puni&s;h him for&s;omuch as he
did k&eacute;epe him pri&s;oner, yet they would not feare but to get
him his pardon. With this bribe and promi&s;e he did depart

by our men which did remaine behinde the Captaine gene|rall,
for that they were not able to goe much, by rea&s;on of
the heate. The Catuall hauing ouertaken the Captaine ge|nerall,
a&s;ked him why he did make &s;o much ha&s;t, or wher he
wer now running away: this was &s;poken by &s;ignes, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> which
the Captaine generall did vnder&s;tand, who aun&s;wered him
al&s;o by &s;ignes that he did runne away to flye the heat. And
being come to <HI>Pandarane,</HI> for that his men as yet did not
appeare, the Captaine generall tolde the Catuall that h&eacute;e
would not goe into the village, vntill his men were come,
and there he tarried for them in a hou&s;e, wherein he re&s;ted
him&s;elfe from the raine: howbeit they came not vntill it
was almo&s;t Sunne &s;et, for &s;o long he did tarry for them be|cau&s;e
they had lo&s;t their waye. But after that they were
come, the Captine generall tolde them, that then it was
not time to leaue him, whereas if &s;o be that they hadde
come &s;ooner, h&eacute;e hadde bene as then in his Shippe.</P>
<P>Wherevppon, immediatelye h&eacute;e did demaunde of the
Catuall a Boate or Pinnace for to goe aboorde in, who
for that h&eacute;e pretended an other thing, aun&s;wered
<PB N="51" REF="57">
him, that it was verye late, and that the &s;hippes did ride
farre, and going in the night he might mi&s;&s;e them, and ther|fore
that it were a great deale better to tarie vntill y^e next
day. To y^e which the Captaine generall made him a plaine
an&s;were, that if &s;o be that he would not giue him an <HI>Al|madias</HI>
or Pinnace, he woulde immediatly returne to the
king &amp; complain vpon him, for&s;omuch as the king had &s;ent
him to his &s;hips, and he would &s;&eacute;eme to &s;tay him, which
was very ill done, &s;ince that he was a Chri&s;tian as they
were. This was &s;poken with &s;uch a coulour as if he wold
haue returned to <HI>Calicut.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;imu|lation in y^e Catuall</NOTE> The Catuall for to di&s;&s;emble
with him the more, did make him a countenance as though
he would giue him thirtie <HI>Almadias,</HI> if he woulde haue
&s;o many. Howbeit he tolde him that he did coun&s;ell him
for the be&s;t, and to remaine. But if &s;o be that he would goe
he was contented therewith. Thus on one parte he &s;ent
to &s;&eacute;eke out <HI>Almadias</HI> or Pinnaces, and on the other part
commaunded the owners of the &s;ame to hide them&s;elues
out of the way becau&s;e they &s;huld not deliuer the &s;ame. In
the meane &s;ea&s;on while they went to &s;&eacute;eke tho&s;e Pinna|ces,
the Captaine Generall went along the water &s;ide, and
for that he had an euill &s;u&s;pition of their dealing, for that
which they had done to him in <HI>Calicut,</HI> he commaunded
<HI>Gon&s;allo Peres,</HI> a Marriner, with other two of his men, to
go before as fa&s;t as they could, &amp; &s;&eacute;e if they could finde <HI>Ni|cholas

that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e while&s;t the Catuall went in the meane &s;ea|&s;on
&s;o lea&s;erly to prouide for this boat, that the night drew
on, &s;o that it was thr&eacute;e houres within night ere he coulde
heare of any thing what h&eacute;e had done, and what for that &amp;
al&s;o to tarrye the comming of tho&s;e that went to <HI>Ni|cholas
Coello,</HI> the Captaine Generall was the willinger
to &s;tay there that night. After that the Catuall had placed
the Generall in a Moores hou&s;e, tolde him that he woulde
<PB REF="58">
goe to &s;&eacute;eke out <HI>Gon&s;allo Peres,</HI> &amp; the other two that went
with him. Howbeit he came not backe till it was the mor|ning.
And as &s;oone as the Captaine Generall had fight of
him, immediatly he required a boate for to goe in vnto
his &s;hippes. But as &s;oone as the Catuall heard him, he then
&s;pake vnto his <HI>Nayres</HI> that were there pre&s;ent in his lan|guage,
who afterward willed the Captaine Generall to co~|maunde
his &s;hips to be brought n&eacute;ere vnto the &s;hoare, and
that being done he &s;houlde haue licen&s;e to goe his waye,
with this the Captaine Generall was &s;omewhat afearde,
howbeit he aun&s;wered him with a &s;tout &s;tomacke, that as
long as he was on land, he would commaund no &s;uch mat|ter
to be done, for&s;omuch as then his brother woulde iudge
him to remaine in pri&s;on, and that he did commaunde the
&s;ame to be done more for feare then any thing els, whervp|on
he wold immediatly depart toward <HI>Portingal,</HI> without

<P>To this the Catuall made an&s;were with the others that
were with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Catu+als pur|po&s;e ope|ned.</NOTE> &s;peaking with a &s;toutne&s;&s;e, that if &s;o be that
he would not doe that which was willed him to doe, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> then
they will not let him go a boord. To the which &s;hewing

to the king of <HI>Calicut,</HI> and make his complaint, who
if then he would &s;tey him in his countris, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> then he would
be verie glad to dwel in the &s;ame. The Catuall therevpon
willed him &s;o to do, &amp; to goe to the king to make his com|plaint,
but yet for all his &s;aieng he would not con&s;ent ther|vnto,
for that he had commaunded the doores of his lodging
to be kept &s;hut, placing within the &s;ame &s;undry <HI>Nayres</HI> with
their weapons. And if &s;o that any of our men &s;hould goe
forth, there were appointed many of the enmyes to with|&s;tand
them. Neuerthele&s;&s;e it was Gods plea&s;ure that the
Catuall dur&s;t not venture to kill the Captaine Generall,
nor yet any of his men for all that the Moores hadde bri|bed
him with a great &s;umme of money, and for all that h&eacute;e
was in great credit with the king, for h&eacute;e &s;toode in &s;uch a

<P>Tho cau&s;e why he required the &s;hippes to be brought to
the &s;hoare &s;ide was, for that they being there, the Moores
might the better laye the &s;ame a boorde, and &s;o take them
and kill all tho&s;e that were within them, which thing for
that it did &s;o manife&s;tly appeare to the Captaine General,
he would not commaund the Shippes to b&eacute;e brought anye
n&eacute;erer. And al&s;o for that the &s;ame was &s;o appareaunt
vnto the others of his men that were with him. They
gaue him coun&s;aile not to deale therein. The Catu|all
&s;&eacute;eing that he would not commaunde tho&s;e Shippes to
b&eacute;e brought n&eacute;ere the &s;hoare, and for that there was no
cau&s;e to &s;taye him or offer him any wrong, and &s;&eacute;eing that
h&eacute;e could not kill him, did then beginne to reque&s;t him to
bring his Sailes and the Rudder of the Shippes a lande.
With that the Captaine Generall beganne to laugh, &s;ay|eng,
that he would neither doe the one, nor yet the other,
&s;ince that the king did giue him fr&eacute;e licen&s;e to goe without
any condition.</P>
<P>And therefore h&eacute;e willed him to doe what he would, and
how that of all the iniuryes which h&eacute;e had offered him, the
king &s;houlde b&eacute;e made priuie, who he knewe woulde doe
him iu&s;tice, but yet for all this, both h&eacute;e and his remay|ned
in &s;ome feare of &s;u&s;pect, although they did not outwardly
&s;hew the &s;ame.</P>
<P>At length the Captaine Generall with the re&s;t feigning
them&s;elues to be an hungred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gene+rals vnef|fectuall excu&s;e.</NOTE> and that they were vnpro|uided

but for all that the Catuall woulde not agr&eacute;e there|vnto.
Nowe our men b&eacute;eing in feare to &s;&eacute;e them&s;elues
in &s;uch a daunger. Then came <HI>Gon&s;allo Peres,</HI> &s;uppo|&s;ing
that the Captaine Generall had ben at his liberty, and
that they were tarrieng for him and the others, who tolde
him that h&eacute;e hadde mette with <HI>Nicholas Coello,</HI> and with

<P><PB REF="59">
This newes being brought to the Captaine Generall, h&eacute;e

<HI>Nicholas Coello</HI> hauing receiued this di&s;patch,

Catuall did replye, that he &s;houlde not make him bel&eacute;eue
that, for&s;omuch as he did well know that all things &s;hould
be done as he would commaund. Howbeit the Captaine

as &s;oone as the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> had knowledge after what
&s;orte they were &s;tayed, would commaunde them to be re|lea&s;ed,

after this order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene+rals con|&s;tancye marueled at by the Catuall</NOTE> becau&s;e he &s;hould giue him &s;ome re|ward.

&s;hew that he was offended, he would n&eacute;eds come to &s;upper
to him that night, at the which they hadde both Rice and
Hens, which he commaunded to be bought the day before.
The Catuall did much meruaile to &s;&eacute;e how little they did
pa&s;&s;e for their clo&s;e k&eacute;eping, after that &s;ort, and of the great
con&s;tancie of the Captaine Generall, that he woulde not

nor yet conde&s;cended to any of the other his reque&s;t. And
for that h&eacute;e thought that it was but a follye to k&eacute;epe him

lybertie, for feare lea&s;t that the king &s;houlde knowe there|of,
for that he gaue him fr&eacute;e lybertie to goe to his &s;hippes.
The next day which was Saterday the &s;econd of Iune, h&eacute;e
then tolde him, that &s;ince he had certified the king that he
would bring his Merchandi&s;e a land, he &s;hould command the

Catuall was content for that he thought to make him&s;elf

they were of a great value, as the Captaine Generall had
tolde him.</P>

From the lande there went aboord both Fi&s;her men &amp; Gen|tiles

heads to be &s;troken off. And as touching all his faire words
and good entertainment, which he had &s;hewed him vnto that
pre&s;ent, as al&s;o to giue him a hou&s;e in the which his Mer|chandize
might be layd, as al&s;o the good entertainment that
our men had, was but m&eacute;ere di&s;&s;imulation, and to the ende,
he might haue taken him a lande with them, &amp; &s;o haue com|maunded
them all to be killed, which was wrought by the
indu&s;trie of the Moores onely, which had made the King be|l&eacute;eue,
that they were th&eacute;eues and went a rouing, and that
he came not vnto his Harbour, but to &s;teale &s;uch Merchan|dize
as &s;hould be brought to the Citie, and al&s;o to e&s;pie the
<PB N="57" REF="63">
Countrey, and after to come with a great Fl&eacute;ete for to in|uade
the &s;ame. In the &s;elfe &s;ame order was the Captaine
generall informed by two <HI>Malabars,</HI> which are Gentiles, be|ing
therefore now in a &s;tudie what was be&s;t to be done, ha|uing
this aduerti&s;ement for mo&s;t certaine, as &s;oone as it was
night, there came aboorde the Generalls &s;hip, a &s;laue of the
colour blacke, which was naturally borne in <HI>Guynee,</HI> &amp; be|longed
vnto <HI>Diego Dias</HI> and al&s;o was a Chri&s;tian, and had
the Portingall tongue very well, who tolde him that <HI>Die|go
Dias</HI> and <HI>Aluoro de Braga</HI> did remain in pri&s;on, &amp; what
aun&s;were the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> had made to his me&s;&s;age, &amp;
what he had commaunded to be done with his pre&s;ent, and
al&s;o what Proclamations there were made: <HI>Diego Dias,</HI>
for that he thought good to giue him knowledge of y^t which
had pa&s;t, had bribed a Fi&s;her man to carrie this me&s;&s;enger,
and that in the night &s;ea&s;on that he might not be knowen.
After that the Captaine generall had heard all this, he was
much offended therewith: howbeit, for that h&eacute;e woulde &s;&eacute;e
the end thereof, would not depart, but did let pa&s;&s;e that day,
to &s;&eacute;e whether that any would come aboord him. The nexte
day which was Wedne&s;daye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boies &s;ent for &s;pyes</NOTE> being the xv. of Augu&s;t, there

he did before, giuing them nothing to vnder&s;tand y^t he knew
of the impri&s;onment of <HI>Diego Dias,</HI> and wold not therefore
laye hand vpon tho&s;e, but vpon &s;uch as &s;houlde come after|ward
(which as he thought &s;hould be of more credite) vntill
&s;uch time as he had recouered tho&s;e that were impri&s;oned.</P>
<P>Vnto tho&s;e al&s;o he wrote a Letter by tho&s;e Boyes,

not haue vnder&s;tood the &s;ame. The&s;e Boyes did deliuer vn|to
him this letter, who afterward told the king what great
entertainment they had at the Captaine generalls hands,
which made him to bel&eacute;eue that he knewe nothing of the
impri&s;onment of his men, whereof he was very glad &amp; did
retourne and &s;end aboord others, and tho&s;e that &s;houlde goe
had warning giuen them not to di&s;clo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Calicuts tre&s;on to+wards the Captaine generall.</NOTE> that the Factour
with the others did remaine pri&s;oners. This was done by
pollicie, for that he made this reckoning to deceiue the Cap|taine
generall on this &s;ort, vntill &s;uch time that he was a|ble
to &s;ende a Fl&eacute;ete of &s;hips vpon him, or til that the &s;hips
of <HI>Meca,</HI> &s;hould come and take him. On this &s;ort went the
<HI>Malabars</HI> aboord, vnto whom the Captaine generall made
a good countenaunce, and commaunded them to be enter|tained
very well: all this he did for y^t he &s;aw none worth
the &s;taieng. On the Sunday next, there came &s;ixe principal
<HI>Malabars,</HI> with other fift&eacute;ene which waited vpon them, in
another Pinace. And for that the Captain generall thought
that for tho&s;e the King would &s;end him his Factor and his
Scriuenour, he laid hands vpon them all, onely he lefte two
Mariners in a pinace, by whom he &s;ent a letter to the kings
Factors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certaine Malabars &s;tayed in exchange</NOTE> written in the <HI>Malabars</HI> tongue, in the which he de|maunded

_ALthough that the Captaine Generall re|ioy&s;ed
very much for that h&eacute;e had di&s;coue|red
<HI>Calicut,</HI> yet he was not fully &s;ati&s;fied
therwith altogether, for that the king had
conceiued again&s;t him great di&s;plea&s;ure, &amp;
by this meanes as he iudged the next fl&eacute;et
that the king his mai&s;ter, &s;hould &s;end, would run in great
daunger. Howbeit perceiuing that it lay not in his power to
do any more, he was therfore contented onely with the di&s;|couery,
and to haue knowne the <HI>Indias,</HI> &amp; of their nauigati|on,
&amp; what was commodious for the Countrie, and to haue
brought with him from thence examples of the &s;pices, drugs,

within the &s;ame citie. And hauing there no more to doe, he
departed, carrieng with him tho&s;e <HI>Malabars</HI> which he had
taken, for that by them he hoped to haue &s;ome agr&eacute;ement
made with the king of <HI>Calicut</HI> at the returne of anye other
Fl&eacute;et. The Thur&s;day after his departure, being in ralme a
league of from <HI>Calicut,</HI> there came towarde him to y^e num|ber

commaunded his ordinaunce to be &s;hot of at them, &amp;
that oftentimes, and if he had not done &s;o, they would haue

did therefore write vnto him a letter in the <HI>Arabian</HI>

then that they &s;houlde be as witne&s;&s;es of that the

And for that he lefte no Factorie in <HI>Calycut</HI> (the which he
was &s;orrie for) was for feare lea&s;t that the Moores &s;houlde

that he woulde &s;ende vnto him a token in &s;igne thereof.

<P>The Captaine generall &s;&eacute;eing that he would declare no

&s;eeing there was no other remedie, &s;aid, that now he would
tell him the truth how that ind&eacute;ede he did dwell with the
<HI>Sabayo,</HI> to whom word was brought that the Captain ge|nerall
went wandring vpon the Seas, as one that knewe
not where he was, and therefore there was in preparing a
great Fl&eacute;ete for to take him. The <HI>Sabayo</HI> hauing notice
thereof, commaunded him to goe thether to vi&s;ite him, and

_FOllowing from hence his cour&s;e

alwayes in cruell &s;tormes, which
the Captaine generall continually

the winde right again&s;t him, it
was the occa&s;ion that the &s;hippes
made but &s;mall way, and therefore it was the longer time
before he entered the gulfe. But after that he was entered
within the &s;ame, he was again troubled with great calmes,
which on the Sea is very trouble&s;ome, not only for the go|uerning
of their &s;hips, but al&s;o with the heat, which is more
hurtfull vpon the &s;ea, then vpon the land, for that ther is no

thus with the heates, the &s;pace of many dayes together, did
afterward returne and breake vp in contrary windes to go
forward, and very good to goe backward. But the Captaine
generall being loath to go backward, wold yet rather tarie
ther wher he was, as ind&eacute;ed he did. And when he perceiued
that the winde was &s;o great and the Seas went &s;o high,
that there was no tarrieng for him with his &s;hippes, then
was he driuen of force to k&eacute;epe the Seas, &s;ometime on this

gouerne their &s;hips. And hoping that after &s;o great &s;tormes
there would come faire weather, were driuen once more to
pray for tho&s;e great calmes which they had before. And
when they &s;awe that this weather was like to endure ma|ny

the occa&s;ion that the Captaine Generall commaunded the

durable there, and that the &s;ame was the cau&s;e that it indu|red

were &s;troken into a very great pen&s;iuene&s;&s;e. The next day
the winde being &s;omewhat incalmed, with the &s;ame the

<P>In the daye the water was of the colour of pitch, and
<PB REF="80">

&s;uch a terrible noy&s;e, and was &s;o fearefull to heare, that

<P>_AFter that the Captaine Generall

But the Captaine generall would not con&s;ent that anye of

<P>After that he &s;awe that there was no hope to haue anye

Who confe&s;&s;ed, that when they had de&s;cryed our Ships,

<P>After that all this was done, y^e Captaine general told him

<P>On the xxviii. daye of December the Captaine Gene|rall

The Captaine generall being informed that the King was

accompanied with all the other boats of y^e Fl&eacute;ete, which
went all in good order, and &s;et out with manye flagges and
trumpets, which being ioyned together as wel the&s;e as tho&s;e
that came from the Citie, made a wonderfull noy&s;e. With
this came tho&s;e pledges aboord the Generalls &s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleadges are &s;ent a|boorde, vvhich feare to be taken cap|tiue.</NOTE> into the

the King, but onely for to get his good will, with this they
were contented, to goe aboorde, yet it was with &s;ome feare,
that he would take them captiues. In the meane while that
we were about this the Captaine generall landed, where
there was tarrieng for him &s;undry <HI>Caymales</HI> and <HI>Pymaca|les,</HI>
and other principall <HI>Nayres,</HI> being accompanied with
many others. And before that the Captaine generall coulde
&s;et his f&eacute;ete on the grounde, he was taken vp, and put in
an Andor or chaire, in the which he was carried to the <HI>Se|rame,</HI>
accompanied with the multitude aboue &s;aide. Being
come to this place, he entered into a certaine hou&s;e where
the King was, whome he founde in this order. The

<HI>Alcatifas,</HI> at the ende whereof, there was a certaine place

him, were twentie cu&s;hions of &s;ilke. The King him&s;elfe
was all naked, &s;auing that about his middle he had a cloth
<PB REF="86">
made of Cotten, which was white as &s;nowe, and wrought
ouer with golde. On his head he had a night cap of cloath
of golde, which was made of the fa&s;hion of an head p&eacute;ece or
&s;kull. On his eares he had hanging certaine Iewelles, of
Diamonds, Saphyres and Pearles, of the which ther was
two bigger then Walnuts. On his armes from the elbow
to the hande he had &s;undrye Bracelettes of Golde, in the
which there were precious Sones, and that without
number, and of a wonderfull valewe. Moreouer on his
legs from the kn&eacute;es downward, and on the fingers of his
handes, and the toes of his feete, and e&s;pecially on his great
toe, there was a ring, in the which there was a Rubie &s;o
great and fine, that it gaue &s;uch a light as was wonderfull:
among&s;t al which &s;tones, ther was a Diamond bigger then
a great Beane. But all this was nothing in compari&s;on of
his girdell, which was made of Golde and Stone that the
&s;ame was aboue all price, and out of it there came &s;uch a
re&s;plendour or brightnes, that it blinded mens eyes to looke
vpon it.</P>
<P>There &s;toode harde by him a Chaire of E&s;tate of golde
and &s;iluer, wrought in the be&s;t manner, full of precious

Al&s;o there were twentie Trumpets, whereof &s;eauent&eacute;ene
were of &s;iluer, and the other thr&eacute;e of golde, the mouthes

was a Ba&s;on of golde in the which he did &s;pit, and certaine

the King was very glad, and tolde the Captaine gene|rall
that he might goe to his lodging to re&s;t him&s;elfe, or els

<P>_AFter that the&s;e newes were brought to

the pre&s;ent which he gaue vnto the

&s;hip, in the which was the Elephant, &amp; now thr&eacute;e moneths
were pa&s;t that he had bene there, and yet had laden no more

al&s;o lea&s;t in <HI>Coching</HI> he &s;houlde not be well accepted,
for taking of the &s;hip in the which was the Elephant. And
further waying with him&s;elfe, how little or none occa&s;ion
at all there was giuen to v&s;e &s;uch trea&s;on again&s;t our men,
he did therefore determine to reuenge him&s;elfe vpon y^e King

then would he be content,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Calicut vvas farre off from making a mendes.</NOTE> &s;o that he might ther haue his la|ding.
But the King of <HI>Calycut</HI> was farre off from the mat|ter,
for he was very glad of that which y^e Moores had done,
and commaunded all &s;uch Merchaundize to be taken, as

&s;&eacute;eing that in all that daye the King of <HI>Calicut</HI> &s;ent no
me&s;&s;enger to excu&s;e him&s;elfe of the fact, he put the matter
in que&s;tion, wheras it was determined that he forthwith
&s;huld reuenge tho&s;e iniuries that were pa&s;t, for feare lea&s;t|if
he &s;hould delay &s;o to doe, that then the King might haue
time to arme his Fl&eacute;ete, which would not then be &s;o ea&s;elye
done. This being determined our men put them&s;elues in a
readine&s;&s;e, to lay aboord x. great &s;hips, which lay in y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> harbor

with them &s;o valyantly, that they brake their order, killing
many of them, and of tho&s;e that remained &s;ome leaped into
the water and were drowned, others hid them&s;elues in their
&s;hips, and other were taken aliue, whom the Captaine ge|nerall
commaunded to pri&s;on, that they might afterwarde
&s;erue for Mariners in the Fl&eacute;et. The &s;hips being thus come
into our mens po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they found within the &s;ame &s;ome
Spices and other Merchaundize which were hidden within
them: al&s;o they found thr&eacute;e Elephants, which the Captaine
generall commaunded to be killed and &s;alted for their victu|alls,
he commaunded al&s;o tho&s;e Moores that were &s;laine to
be told, and there was found of them 600. The &s;hips being
di&s;charged of all that they had, they wer &s;et a fire before all
the Citie, in the &s;ight of many that came to the water &s;ide
to &s;uccor them, whom being Moores, as they were comming
in their <HI>Almadias,</HI> our men encountered and fought with
them, but they dur&s;t not goe forward for feare of the ordi|naunce.
This was a wonder to tho&s;e of the Citie, to &s;&eacute;e ten

Captaine generall not being contented with the burning of

morning began to appeare, immediately all the great Ordi|naunce
went off among&s;t their hou&s;es, which after that the
enimies had &s;&eacute;ene, and how n&eacute;ere our &s;hips lay to the &s;hore,

without hurting any of our men, howbeit of our ordinance,
for that the enimies came running in flockes, there was no
p&eacute;ece that mi&s;t, and by that meanes there were manye that
fell, and the others that drew towards the Citie, where our
ordinaunce al&s;o had made a great de&s;truction, as well in the
Temples of their Gods, as in their dwelling hou&s;es. The

came a multitude of Moores to defend them, and for that our

The Captaine generall with the other Captaines peru&s;ing

onely haue his kingdome in great a&s;&s;uraunce, but al&s;o that
he would ayde him to conquere others. He willed him al&s;o

<P>The&s;e wordes were &s;poken afore many of his <HI>Nayres,</HI>

<P>This being agr&eacute;ed vppon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A battaile by &s;ea be|tween our &s;hips, and the kings of Calicut</NOTE> the Generall began to beare

with the one alone, and <HI>Pedro Raphael,</HI> and <HI>Diego Pieres</HI>
with the other. Their m&eacute;eting was with &s;uch a valyaunt
minde, that out of both the Enimyes &s;hippes there leapt
many into the Sea. The fight indured no longer, but vn|till
&s;uch time the Captaine generall with the other &s;hippes
drewe n&eacute;ere, who did alwayes &s;hoote off at them. In the
meane while the re&s;t of the Enimies did beare all that they
could towarde the &s;hoare. The Captaine generall for feare
of the lo&s;&s;e of &s;ome of his &s;hippes, would not followe, the
rather for that they were all laden: Howbeit, our men
leapte into theyr boates, and there fought with tho&s;e that
were &s;wimming in the water, and &s;lewe them all: the
which were n&eacute;ere to the number of thr&eacute;e hundred per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>After this the Captaine Generall commaunded to di&s;|charge

preparing of &s;ouldiers, be&s;ides that h&eacute;e had commanded much
ordinaunce to be made, and that the Moores of <HI>Coching</HI> were
greatly in his fauour, and therfore he did aduerti&s;e him not
to tru&s;t much vnto them: within two daies after the receipt

had ri&s;en again&s;t him, and that nowe they minded to

<P>VNto this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gene+rals co~for|table aun|&s;vvere vn|to y^e king of Co|ching.</NOTE> <HI>Franci&s;co de Alburquerque,</HI> aun&s;wered him,

then that he had, which was but a &s;mall quantitie, h&eacute;e
determined to depart toward <HI>Portingale,</HI> but fir&s;t he would
nominate him that &s;hould remaine in the <HI>Indias</HI> for Cap|taine
generall, that the King of <HI>Coching</HI> &s;hould vnder&s;tand
the &s;ame. And for that he knew, that he that was appoyn|ted,
would thinke it very dangerous to remaine there, with
&s;o few men as he was able to leaue him, he dur&s;t commit
it to none of his Captaines. Howbeit after that he had offe|red

he &s;ent him word, that it were not requi&s;ite that h&eacute;e
&s;hould haue him away, but rather offered him, if &s;o be that
he would tarrie, to giue him the Pepper that he had promi|&s;ed

_THe king being with this, &s;omwhat ea&s;ed &amp;

great n&eacute;ede thereof. But they all were wel
furni&s;hed, &s;auing onely the foord, which he
commanded to be fortified with &s;takes, that ther might en|ter
no ve&s;&s;ells of the enimies. In the meane time he was
aduerti&s;ed by a Letter from <HI>Rodrigo Reynel,</HI> that a prin|cipall
Moore of <HI>Coching,</HI> and be&s;ides diuer&s;e others, did pro|cure
all that they could to leaue the citie, that y^e king might
remaine alone, &amp; that thervpon this Moore hath come twice
to &s;peake with the king of <HI>Calycut</HI> in his owne behalfe, and
in the name of the others. This newes troubled the Cap|taine
Generall a while, howbeit to di&s;appoint them of their
&s;uttle dealing, and that the &s;ame &s;houlde take no effect, h&eacute;e
thought it nece&s;&s;arie to execute this principall Moore, that
the others might conceiue &s;ome feare thereof. This b&eacute;eing
knowne to the king of <HI>Coching,</HI> he woulde not con&s;ent
therevnto, thinking that if &s;o be that he were executed, the
others would make a mutenie immediatly, and then there
&s;huld be no victualls brought into the citie, for that tho&s;e did
prouide the citie therewith in trucke of their merchandi&s;e,
and therefore he thought be&s;t to di&s;&s;emble with them all.
The Captaine Generall &s;&eacute;eing that the king woulde not
con&s;ent therevnto, tolde him that he woulde talke with the
Moores him&s;elfe, and that he had thought to v&s;e &s;ome poli|cie

It were great &s;hame for women &s;o to doe, much more

replie vnto the king, that although our men had done mo&s;t
valiantly, yet that which they did was like vnto the dedes
of de&s;perate men. Notwith&s;tanding, that they were not a|ble
to defende them&s;elues long, from &s;uch a power as his
was, in e&s;pecially, not hoping to haue any &s;uccour. And
therefore they willed him to &s;et vpon them often times,
for by that meanes it was po&s;&s;ible to take them. Some
al&s;o of tho&s;e kinges and noble men that came to &s;uccoure
the king, and that were de&s;irous of warres, did confirme
that which the Italians had &s;aide before, addinge moreo|uer,
that God doth permitte his enemies &s;ometime to haue
the victorie, for a more greater lo&s;&s;e vnto them, and there|fore
it were good &s;aide they, that he followed his friends
coun&s;ell, and prooued their &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;&s;e. And although it
were &s;o, that he had not the victorie immediatelye, yet hee
&s;hould not therefore di&s;paire. The king finding him&s;elfe
&s;omewhat vexed in minde with tho&s;e wordes, aun&s;wered
them &s;aying. Although that eche of you is &s;o valiant, that
<PB REF="146">

Howbeit I &s;uppo&s;e yet, that you doe &s;&eacute;e in me no &s;uch a

in ouercomming the&s;e Chri&s;tians, but rather in them,
in defending them&s;elues from vs, as they haue done. Wher
in it hath well appeared,</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">No doubt but God doeth fight for his &s;er|uants&punc;</NOTE> that their God did fight for them.</P>
<P>And will you &s;&eacute;e how it is &s;o? You maye well
con&s;ider, that our men are many, and that they haue bene
valyant in the warres pa&s;t, it hath well appeared in many

with the&s;e Chri&s;tians, they &s;&eacute;eme to be (not as they were)

conceiued. And certainly, as farre as I can learne, and al|&s;o
all tho&s;e that are of a good iudgement, we ought to be|l&eacute;eue,
that tho&s;e workes are rather of God, then of man.
For who is he that would not be afeard of them, wel per|ceiuing
that all others are? I meane not onely the King
of <HI>Cochings</HI> &s;ubiects which came to &s;uccour vs, who haue

vs.</Q></P>

they &s;hould receiue &s;o many iniuries. If wee doe it
for that they laide hande vpon a Shippe of the Moores,

wold wel haue appered, y^t the king had ben in no fault of y^t
which they had done. And this had bene &s;ufficient to haue
confirmed the friend&s;hip of the Chri&s;tians with him, &amp; this
al&s;o would haue bene a cau&s;e &s;ufficient, to haue kept them
in <HI>Calicut</HI> from going to <HI>Coching,</HI> to haue there &s;etteled a

they doe receiue. For the receiuing of them as y^e King

the which they had taken from a Cou&s;in of his. If the&s;e

were prices not to be left. You know how rich a Pre&s;ent
they brought to the King, and what ritch merchandi&s;e they
brought, and how much golde and &s;iluer. Tho&s;e fi&s;hermen
which they did carrie away naked, did retourne againe all
apparailed. If then we were friends, how &s;urely &s;hould we
liue: &amp; what profit &s;hould the King haue, if we had amitie

<HI>Repelyn,</HI> both he and the Moores did per&s;wade the king
to fight another battell with the Captaine Generall, the
which he would willingly not haue done, for that he was
wearyed in his &s;pirit, but he could not with&s;tand them, and
therefore commaunded the &s;ame to b&eacute;e giuen both by Sea

of <HI>Calycut</HI> hath bene and now is abated &s;o greatly of his
<PB N="161" REF="167">
pride, that he n&eacute;eded not to &s;tande in no feare of him anye

thing, that now he &s;awe the Moores of <HI>Meca</HI> to go theyr
way from <HI>Calycut</HI> as men de&s;perate for the lo&s;&s;e of their

and then to &s;erue him for a longer time, and more at
his plea&s;ure. With this aun&s;were the King was &s;omwhat
&s;ati&s;fied, and with the teares in his eyes de&s;ired him to par|don
him, for that he did not giue him all that was his de|&s;ire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The good vvill of a thankfull minde is much more vvorth the~ many gifts&punc;</NOTE>
in recompence of the &s;eruice he had done for him, in
con&s;ideration that he was &s;o poore, as he did well knowe.
Howbeit he intreated him, that of his Pepper which h&eacute;e
had, he would take what he woulde.
But <HI>Edwarte Pacheco</HI> would haue nothing, &s;aieng, that he
did tru&s;t in God, that when he retourned to <HI>Coching,</HI> h&eacute;e
&s;hould finde him very rich, &amp; in his pro&s;peritie, and then he
would receiue reward of him. And with this he departed,
the King with all his &s;ubiects remaining verye heauie for
his departure. Moreouer, the King wrote vnto the king of
<HI>Portingale</HI> of all <HI>Edwarte Pacheco</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the warres,
and what he had done for him. After this the Captain ge|rall
departed toward <HI>Cananor,</HI> the xxvi. of September, ca|rieng
in his companye tho&s;e Captaines which &s;houlde re|maine
in the <HI>Indias.</HI> His good wil &amp; intent was, to come to
an Ankor in the harbour of <HI>Panane,</HI> and there to vi&s;ite the
King of <HI>Tanor.</HI> But by rea&s;on of the ill weather they had,
and their naughtie Pilots they could not reach y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ame, but
were driuen to <HI>Calycut</HI> and <HI>Pandarane.</HI> And from thence
he commaunded <HI>Pedro Raphael</HI> and <HI>Diego Pieres</HI> to go be|fore
the Fl&eacute;ete, and to looke out, whether they could &s;ee any
&s;hips of the Moores. Being ariued at <HI>Pandarane,</HI> &amp; bearing
along the Coa&s;t with a &s;mall winde, there came vpon them
x. <HI>Paros</HI> of the xvii. &s;hips that were ther a lading. Our men
hauing &s;ight of them, began forthwith to &s;hoote at them
with their ordinaunce. The other Captayns being a Sea
boord, and hearing the &s;ound of the ordinance, did returne,
and bare as clo&s;e by the winde as they could.
<PB REF="168">
And hauing &s;ight of the &s;hips of the Moores to be a ground,
came to <HI>Cananor</HI> by the Captaine generalls commaunde|ment,
who immediately entered into coun&s;aile, in y^e which
it was determined by the whole con&s;ent of his Captains,
that they &s;huld fight with tho&s;e Moores, and that they &s;huld
goe in their boates, for that their &s;hips could not come n&eacute;ere
vnto them, by rea&s;on they were within the Barre. And for
that the enimies were many, that therefore they &s;hould do
what they could to clo&s;e with the &s;hips, the which as &s;oone
as they had done, they &s;huld &s;et the &s;ame a fire. This being
appointed, the Captaine general with all y^e other Captains
of the Fl&eacute;ete, did imbarke them&s;elues in their boates, the
which were in all xv. in the which all the &s;ouldiers of the
Fl&eacute;ete did imbarke them&s;elues, and that with a great cou|rage
for that they went to fight with their enimies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great proui&s;ion of the Moores a|gain&s;t &s;o fevv &s;mall boates.</NOTE> The&s;e

one clo&s;e by another, with their &s;tearnes toward the land,
and in the mo&s;t part of them wer many &s;ouldiers, y^e which
were men of coulour white. Their weapon were bowes
and arrowes, and al&s;o they had much ordinaunce. And on
the land, at the entering of the barre were placed two p&eacute;e|ces
of ordinaunce vpon a &s;mall bulwarke which they had
made. Our men bearing n&eacute;ere to this barre, had &s;ight of the
Captaine generall, and how the Caruells were &s;omewhat
farre off the &s;hore, and that they came not, for that y^e wind
was but &s;mall, and therefore were perforce driuen to re|turne
backe for them, &amp; to bring them by force of the oare
within the Barre, for to &s;uccour their boates. The other
Captaines (although they &s;aw him returne) went forward
by force of the oare, and at the entering of the Barre, the
Pellets fell as though it had rayned among&s;t them. But
for all this they entered, &s;hooting of all their Ordinaunce.
But as their enimies were farre more then they, &s;o theyr
arrowes were without number. And for that our men by
rea&s;on they wer &s;omwhat low vnder their &s;hips, wer open
without any defence, therefore did they receiue great hurt,
not onely by their ordinance, but al&s;o by their arrowes.

H&eacute;ere as it appeared, was all the force of the battaile: and
for all the &s;toutne&s;&s;e that was &s;hewed by the enimies, yet
our men entred into the middes of all the multitude of the

which he tooke to be y^e Admirall, of y^e which a Turke
was Captaine with all his company, which were manye.
And at the boording of this &s;hip, were throwen &s;uch a mul|titude
of &s;tones and darts, that it was a wonder to &s;&eacute;e. It
chaunced that before our men came to this &s;hip, the eni|mies
&s;hooting at them with a p&eacute;ece, y^e which was lieng vpo~
the vpper decke, with y^e recoyling it rent out a p&eacute;ece of the

not regarding it, thought it more n&eacute;edfull to &s;uccor y^t fore-part
of their &s;hip. And when our boat came hard a boord y^e
&s;ame &s;ide where this hole was, our men did enter by the

another <HI>Aluoro Lopes,</HI> who was y^e things &s;eruant, &amp; is now

drowned them&s;elues. While this was a doing, thether
came the Captayne generall, with the Caruells, and b&eacute;eing
entered within the Barre, he lefte them. Then one of the
p&eacute;eces that were on the lande was &s;hot off with a pellet,

in &s;uch a place, that with the &s;ame were thr&eacute;e of his men

carried him vnder the foreca&s;tle of a &s;hip, of tho&s;e that wer
not as yet layd aboord, the which had many men. And for
that the &s;hippe was higher then the Caruell, who had the
&s;ame vnder his &s;prit &s;aile, therefore the enimies did enter,
and handeled our men very ill, for that they altogether did
&s;et vpon them. Al&s;o there was another p&eacute;ece &s;hot, with the
which the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip was &s;lain, being at the helme
gouerning the Caruell, which being thus left at randon,
before that there came any other to the helme, the Caruell
fell vpon certaine Rockes, where &s;he remained till the bat|taile
was ended. The Captaine generall viewing the dan|ger
that <HI>Pedro Raphael</HI> was in, commaunded him to b&eacute;e
&s;uccoured, and &s;o it was done. Then our men entering in|to
the Caruell, the which was full of Moores, they behaued
them&s;elues &s;o valyantly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Here vvas a great &s;laughter of the Por+tingals in re&s;pect of other battailes &s;ought.</NOTE> that they made them flye awaye,
but notwith&s;tanding all our men that were within y^e Car|uell
were &s;ore hurt. In the meane &s;pace, all the &s;hips of the
enimies were burnt, and this al&s;o at the la&s;t, in the which
was burnt great &s;tore of Merchaundi&s;e, for that the &s;ame
was laden. Which was done the rather, for that vpon the
land there were many of the enimies which wer a&s;&s;embled
together. And for that of our men there were many hurt,
the Captain generall came his way with all his Captains
toward their &s;hips, where he found that there were &s;laine

for all this the victorie was great. For ouer and be&s;ides

was much, the Captaine generall was giuen to vnder&s;tand
by the Moores of <HI>Cananor,</HI> (to the which place from thence
he went) that ther were &s;laine in this battell two thou&s;and

contented, that fro~ that time for a good while after, he could
