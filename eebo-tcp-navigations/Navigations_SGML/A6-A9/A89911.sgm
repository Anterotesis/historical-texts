<HEAD>A LETTER FROM ROTTERDAM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe newes we have at pre&s;ent here, I &s;hall impart to you. (as far as time will give leave.) About 2 or 3 months &s;ince, the E&s;tates of <HI>Holland</HI> had &s;ome difference with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> about ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">er|ing or disbanding of forces, they de&s;iring that they might ea&s;e the people of their taxes, as the ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">r Pro|vinces have (they alone paying about 60 <HI>g. per cent.</HI> whenas all the other 6 <HI>Provinces</HI> pay but the remaining 40 between them all) they complained much of their Officers, that they abu&s;ed them by fal&s;e Mu&s;tering their
<PB N="2" REF="3">Souldiers; for if they were allowed 60 in a Compa|ny, they would not keep above 30. and the rea&s;on was (the Capt. &s;ay) for want of current payment, being forct to make u&s;e of men called Soliciteurs to furni&s;h them with Money, who deduct above 20 or 25 <HI>Per. cent.</HI> for their disbur&s;ment. Now the E&s;tates of <HI>Hol|land</HI> indeed, did not &s;o much de&s;ire to disband any Sol|diers; but that the Companies being &s;o &s;mall, they might disband &s;ome Officers, and keep up all the Soul|diers, and by ca&s;hiering of tho&s;e Soliciteurs, and by managing the bu&s;ine&s;s well in paying the Souldiers currently them&s;elves, they would &s;ave 100000 pound <HI>Per Annum.</HI> The <HI>major</HI> Vote in the States General was, to &s;ide with the Prince, the one having a Brother a Soliciteur, a Cou&s;en perhaps a Col. another friend a Capt. &amp;c. and they petitioning them and the P. of <HI>O|range</HI> continually to be kept up, and not disbanded: re&s;olved they would live and dy with each other, (now you mu&s;t take notice that all the States General did not give their Votes to this, but the Major part; for 2 or 3 Provinces have &s;ince prote&s;ted again&s;t their pro|ceedings) and then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cavelieri&s;h Col. and Capt. under his Command, with tho&s;e of the States General, (that had voted they &s;hould not be disbanded) tickled him in the ear with many &s;trang things that they would do for him, and to curb <HI>Holland</HI> by the &s;word, and to make him a Soveraign of the&s;e Coun|tries, and certainly to effect this, he wanted none of <HI>Charles Stuarts</HI> Councel, nor of his mother <HI>Mall</HI> nei|ther, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Malignants here did report tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> their de&s;ign was a month &s;ince ju&s;t as hereafter rela|ted. On the 20. <HI>June</HI> or there abouts, the Prince with his Colonels Capt. and other Officers, mo&s;t <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">Malignants, with &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners of the E|&s;tates General, went about to all the towns in <HI>Holland,</HI> where the Prince was nobly entertained as their Gen. but at <HI>Am&s;terdam, Delph, Dort, Medemcleck, Harlen</HI> &amp; <HI>Hoarne,</HI> they would not give them audience in their publick Common-Councels, (in their Towns) not ac|knowledging the Commi&s;&s;ions they came withall, &s;o they gave them no content; the Prince with the re&s;t returned again to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where they were all as it were mad that they could not obtain their ends; re|maining there, they &s;tudyed day and night of a way how to obtain that by force, which (as they thought) could not be had with Love: So on <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t (be|ing the 30. <HI>alias</HI> 20. <HI>July</HI>) the P. of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;eized on 6 Lords of <HI>Holland</HI> as they were in full Councel, <HI>viz.</HI> one of <HI>Dort,</HI> one of <HI>Delph,</HI> two of <HI>Harlen,</HI> one of <HI>Horn,</HI> two of <HI>Medembleck</HI> and tho&s;e two of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> e&s;ca|ped; they were the next day all carried to a Ca&s;tle near <HI>Gorcom</HI> called <HI>Love&s;tein,</HI> being chiefly for a pri&s;on, were none but traytors are put in. That &s;ame day <HI>viz.</HI> the 30. <HI>alias</HI> 20. <HI>July,</HI> the Prince gave Commi&s;|&s;ion for his Army to march out of Gari&s;on to <HI>Am&s;ter|dam;</HI> where on <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t in the morning, appear|ed 2000 hor&s;e and 1000 foot; but being di&s;covered by the <HI>Hamborough Po&s;t,</HI> the Lords of the Town were acquainted therewith, and command was given, the Gates &s;hould be &s;hut, and the Magazine being opened, about 300 pieces of Ordnance, was by the boys and labourers in the &s;treets drag'd up to the wals and Scon|ces, and Drums beat for the trained bands to be pre|&s;ently in Arms, which was effected: as al&s;o the Soul|diery that belongs to the Town, being about 5 or 600 were al&s;o in Arms, &amp; kept &s;trict watch both at gates &amp;
<PB N="4" REF="4">walls, the &s;ame day a Company of their Soldiers with Carpenters went out, and cut down all draw Bridges, and got men of war in great number, to lye from <HI>Texel</HI> to the River <HI>Tye,</HI> for fear of forces to come in by Sea (as was reported) from <HI>Zealand,</HI> the mean time drums beat for to li&s;t Soldiers in the Town, and gave 15 <HI>&s;ti|vers</HI> a day, and in 2 days time had above 12000 Soul|diers in pay, on the Lords day they in the Town &s;et o|pen their &s;luces, and drowned all the land round about, &s;o that the <HI>Princes</HI> &s;ouldiery was forc't to keep on the bank-&s;ides, which were high; the mean time mo&s;t part of all his Army came down thither both hor&s;e &amp; Foot, and laid &s;iege to it; and in 2 or 3 places began to make works again&s;t it. Take notice that till the Lords day noone he him&s;elf remained in the <HI>Hague,</HI> and knew no otherwi&s;e but his men were got into <HI>Am&s;terdam:</HI> but when he heard the contrary, he was mad and ready to tare his hair off his head, and &s;eeing him&s;elf thus deprived of his hopes in the de&s;ign, he (like a Lyon robbed of her whelps) did &s;o take on, and immediatly in per&s;on went to the leaguer; where in a rage, as before mentioned, he began to rai&s;e works, but to no purpo&s;e. The mean time, this town of <HI>Rot|terdam</HI> &s;tood nutral, and we expected every hour that &s;ome of his Souldiers would come and quarter upon us, but did not, and <HI>Dort, Delph, Leyden, Harlen</HI> and o|ther Townes &s;hut their Gates, and were in Arms. On <HI>Munday</HI> and <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the E&s;tates of <HI>Holland</HI> (con&s;i&s;ting of one or two men out of each Town) met, and re|&s;olved to &s;end for him home, and the States Gen. &s;ee|ing his de&s;ign broke, they mo&s;t of them fell off from him, and both &s;ent a Committee to him to Treat, and tho&s;e al&s;o of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;ent to him, and on <HI>Wedne&s;|day</HI> la&s;t they were agreed as followeth.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>That the Army &s;hall again march to their quarters, and the town &s;hall not be mole&s;ted; but that trading may be free, and tho&s;e that were the cau&s;ers of this trouble, &s;hall give an account for it afterward; which &s;hall be di&s;|puted at the next meeting at the HAGUE.</P>
<P>It is my opinion, that though the bu&s;ine&s;s is appea&s;ed for the pre&s;ent; yet &s;ome heads will fly for it, and the P. him&s;elf, if his head remains on his &s;houlders, it will be well: however they all &s;ay, they will take a great part of his power from him. Certainly if he had taken AMSTERDAM, he would have made him&s;elf Soveraign of the&s;e Countries, to have made &s;laves of the&s;e people of Holland; His intentions were to have &s;eized upon the Banck there, and the &s;tock of the town, which is many millions. The people in general hate this odious de&s;ign of his, and as well Magi|&s;trates as people &s;ay plainly, they may thank his brother Charls for this, and had he ob|tained his de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e, he had mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly curb'd the E&s;tates of Holland for their friendly a&s;si&s;t|ance or corre&s;pondency, and would have bin very able to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Brother; but we may &s;ee much of God in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and I hope
<PB N="6" REF="5">the&s;e Countries will make a fa&s;ter union with <HI>England</HI> then ever yet they have done. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Malignants here, are &s;ad at this bu&s;ine&s;s, for they were in hopes, and were confidently a&s;&s;ured had this de&s;ign gone on, that their de&s;ign al&s;o would be promoted by it. I have thus as near as I can, given you the relation of this bu|&s;ine&s;s; for any other particulars, I refer you to <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> Letters, <HI>Vale.</HI></P>
<P>If the troubles had continued, I had &s;ent my wife &amp; child to <HI>London per</HI> this pa&s;&s;age now a going, <HI>per</HI> whom al&s;o many families of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would have gone, all things being packed up in a readine&s;s; but now we &s;hall wait to &s;ee what God &s;hall farther do with us. Some of your Company removed their cloth to <HI>Zealand,</HI> for it was not here without danger; For a great many Companies of <HI>Souldiers</HI> were quartered at the <HI>Hague</HI> and we did expect them or others here, and the Malignants would have been favoured, but the better party burthened.</P>
<P>The Lord of <HI>Dort</HI> that was taken pri&s;oner (by name <HI>De Witt</HI>) is dead, its thought poy&s;oned.</P>
