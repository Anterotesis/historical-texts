<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>Mineral Waters</HI> Lately found out in the CITY of CANTERBURY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. VVHEREAS &s;ome Per&s;ons have, and do &s;till endeavour to divert People from the U&s;e of the <HI>Mineral Waters</HI> found out in this City a few Years pa&s;t; either out of Prejudice to the Per&s;ons concern'd, or for other Rea&s;ons better known to them&s;elves: It is thought advi&s;eable (that the Publick may not be depriv'd of the Benefit of &s;o great a Remedy) to publi&s;h this &s;hort Account of 'em; and at the &s;ame time to de|&s;ire tho&s;e Per&s;ons that find &s;o much fault with the&s;e Waters, that if they have any thing to object again&s;t 'em, or again&s;t the Account here given of 'em, to acquaint the Publick with it, that the World may not be impos'd upon and damnify'd by what is here &s;aid of 'em.</P>
<P N="2">II. In digging the&s;e Wells, they fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd a fat black Mold extending it &s;elf three foot deep, and
<PB N="2" REF="2">gradually changing into another &s;ort of Earth very fat, and like Butter, if &s;quees'd between the Fingers. This <HI>&s;econd</HI> Lay of Earth was two foot thick; the Colour of it was yellow, &s;omething mixt: its Odour very &s;trong and mineral, and being expos'd to the Sun for a while, it &s;mell'd like Brim&s;tone. After this they met with a Quick&s;and of a darker Colour than the fir&s;t Earth, mixt with &s;everal little black Stones; the Smell was &s;tronger than before. Two foot further under this Quick&s;and a hard Rock appeared, out of which the Water gu&s;h'd out. They dug two Wells at about &s;even Foot di&s;tance from each other. The Bigne&s;s is between 8 and 9 Foot deep from its own Surface, and 12 from the Surface of the Ground a|bout it, and reacheth the Rock. The other Well is not &s;o deep by two Foot, and only toucheth the Sand. The fir&s;t is &s;tronger of the Spirit, and the Mineral is more ferruginous, but the &s;econd is &s;tronger of the <HI>Sulphur.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Two Drams of the &s;econd Lay of Earth, found in digging the&s;e Wells, being put into four Ounces of <HI>Spirit of Vinegar,</HI> there pre&s;ently aro&s;e a con&s;iderable Ebullition, and &s;oon after the <HI>Spirit</HI> was ting'd with a yellow browny Colour. This <HI>Tincture</HI> &s;uffer'd no Alteration with the Infu&s;ion of <HI>Logwood,</HI> nor with <HI>Galls,</HI> but with Oil of <HI>Tartar p. deliq.</HI> turn'd greeni&s;h, and with the Tincture of <HI>Lig|num Nephriticum,</HI> of a pale Red.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This Water taken up at the Well, is extra|ordinary limpid, but grows &s;omething whiti&s;h in
<PB N="3" REF="2">a quarter of an Hour, and in half an Hour the Spirit is lo&s;t, and the Mineral hangs fir&s;t on the &s;ides of the Gla&s;s, and then falls gradually to the bottom; and if a Bottle with this Water be never &s;o well &s;top'd, it will not keep its Spirit. Its Ta&s;te is Ma&s;cu|line and au&s;tere. The Smell is mineral and &s;trong, much upon the Sulphur, e&s;pecially the little Well.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Root of the Tongue and Stools of them that drink of the little Well are grayi&s;h, but if they drink of the great Well they are brown.</P>
<P N="6">VI. This Water is commonly cold; but in Fro&s;ty Weather it is &s;o warm as to &s;moak, and melt all the Ice and Snow that comes near it.</P>
<P N="7">VII. By Di&s;tillation it giveth nothing but a Wa|ter in every re&s;pect like common Water.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Mutton</HI> boil'd in this Water is more white and tender than in common Water. Some think it hath made their <HI>Beer</HI> &s;tronger being brew'd with it. <HI>Linen</HI> wa&s;h'd in it turns yellow. It will not lather with <HI>Soap.</HI> The <HI>Gla&s;&s;es</HI> the Water is dip'd with grow yellow at the bottom, which no Scowring can take off.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The <HI>Weight</HI> of it varies much, according to the Sea&s;ons and Weather. In <HI>May</HI> 1704, it weighed three Grains lighter than common Water in the Quantity of a Pound. In the Spring of 1705, it was equal in Weight with common Water; but in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> of the &s;ame Year, the Weight was con&s;iderably increas'd, becau&s;e of the exceeding dry Weather of that Summer; which made the Wa|ter
<PB N="4" REF="3">&s;o &s;trong with the Mineral, that it lo&s;t its Lim|pidity. In general about Mid&s;ummer, if the Wea|ther is not over dry, the Weight of this Water is equal to common Water.</P>
<P N="10">X. A &s;ingle Grain Weight of <HI>Gall</HI> will turn a Pint and a half of this Water of a very noble deep red, and that in an in&s;tant. <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Violets</HI> turns it of a Gra&s;s-green. With the Infu&s;ion of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> it giveth a deep lovely blue: With that of <HI>Lignum Nephri|ticum,</HI> fir&s;t a light green, then a light yellow, with a blue Crown on the Surface: With the Infu&s;ion of <HI>Logwood</HI> a blue black: With that of <HI>Fu&s;tick Wood,</HI> a dusky yellow: With the <HI>Flowers</HI> of <HI>Pomegranates,</HI> a fair Violet: With <HI>Leaves</HI> of <HI>Green Thea,</HI> a fine purpli&s;h blue: With good <HI>Nants Brandy,</HI> an ele|gant Sky Colour.</P>
<P N="11">XI. This Water turns a <HI>Solution</HI> of the <HI>Sugar</HI> of Lead milky in one in&s;tant; and even the <HI>Solution</HI> of <HI>Sublimate</HI> in a quarter of an hour. But <HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Tartar, Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol, Spirit</HI> of <HI>Sal Armoniac,</HI> make no Alteration with it.</P>
<P N="12">XII. In calm Weather a thick fat Film covers the Surface of this Water, of more Variety of Colours than a Rainbow: A Spoonful of it drunk hath the Effect of, and compo&s;eth as much to Sleep as a mo|derate Do&s;e of <HI>Opium.</HI> Being dry'd by Evaporation, it ta&s;ted very fat, and &s;et &s;o between the Fingers. Some of this Powder being ca&s;t upon a red hot Iron, mo&s;t of it immediately con&s;um'd away with &s;ome Sparkling; and what remain'd was of the Co|lour
<PB N="5" REF="3">of Ru&s;t of Iron, and ta&s;ted partly Stiptick and Earthy, and partly Salted.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. By gentle Evaporation this Water yeilds a yellowi&s;h Sediment, more or le&s;s, according to the Sea&s;ons. La&s;t Spring a Quart yeilded but &s;ix Grains of it; but in <HI>September</HI> following it afforded me about nine. Whereas a Pound of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> Water gave but one Grain Weight of this Sediment to the Honourable <HI>Robert Boyle,</HI> as may be &s;een in his <HI>Short Memoirs of Mineral Waters;</HI> &s;o that when the&s;e Wa|ters are weake&s;t, they are three to one &s;tronger of the <HI>Mineral</HI> than that of <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. This abovementioned Sediment being boil'd in River Water, made a &s;trong <HI>Lixivium,</HI> with which the <HI>Tincture</HI> of <HI>Galls,</HI> nor that of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> nor that of <HI>Logwood,</HI> nor the <HI>Solution</HI> of <HI>Sugar</HI> of <HI>Lead,</HI> made no remarkable Alteration: But <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Violets</HI> turn'd it green, <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Nitre, Spirit</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> caus'd no &s;en&s;ible Fermentation.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Some of the afore&s;aid <HI>Lixivium</HI> being gently evaporated, yeilded a fat &s;ulphureous kind of Salt. There is more or le&s;s of this Salt, according to the Sea&s;ons; This Spring I had about two Grains of it out of ten Grains of Sediment; but la&s;t Autumn I had about three.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The Stones on, and the Chanel in which this Water glides along, is always lin'd with a yellow hard Cru&s;t.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P N="17">XVII. I will at pre&s;ent &s;uper&s;ede &s;everal more Experiments made upon this Subject, de&s;igning, God willing, to enlarge upon it another time; and I have rea&s;on to hope here is enough to &s;how,</P>
<P N="1">1. That what &s;ome have &s;aid, that this Water was Artificial; others, that it was ting'd with Cop|per; others, that it comes from the <HI>Tan-Pits</HI> of the Neighbourhood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is the Effect only of Preju|dice, or Ignorance, to give it no wor&s;e Name.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this Water is animated with a con&s;ider|able Quantity of a fine <HI>volatile &s;ulphureous Spirit,</HI> admirably &s;ympathizing with that of our Body.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is impregnated with a <HI>ferruginous li|quid Sulphur,</HI> a <HI>Liquamen Martis, Iron</HI> in <HI>Embrio,</HI> and that to three times as much more as <HI>Tunbridge Wa|ter,</HI> to which it is al&s;o preferable on account of its not being &s;o fixt.</P>
<P N="4">4. That there is in it an <HI>alcaleous &s;ulphureous Salt,</HI> to about a fourth part of the whole mineral Sub|&s;tance; and that it is of the &s;ame Nature with the Salt found in the <HI>German Spaw-Water.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE OPERATIONS and VIRTUES OF THIS WATER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THIS Water being drink'd &s;et plea&s;antly up|on the Stomach, (except &s;ometime in the Beginning, when the Stomach is foul) works it &s;elf off by Urine, keeps the Body moderately open, and &s;ometime purges. It creates a good Stomach, but not &s;uch a voracious Appetite, as to make the Drink|ers &s;ick after Dinner; nor is it &s;o cold; nor does it go off with a kind of <HI>Tene&s;mus,</HI> as <HI>Tunbridge</HI> Wa|ter often does.</P>
<P N="2">II. It manife&s;tly rai&s;eth the Pul&s;e, chears the Heart, quickens the Spirits, invigorates the Fibers of the Blood, Glands, and other Ve&s;&s;els, and re&s;tores their &s;pringing Property. It clean&s;eth the Body, and gently evacuates all &s;uperfluous and noxious Hu|mours by Stools, Urine, and Per&s;piration.</P>
<P N="3">III. The&s;e Waters remove the Di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from preternatural Heat, by wa&s;hing away all bilious and adu&s;t Humours, and di&s;&s;olving acrid alcaleous Salts.</P>
<P N="4">IV. They cure the Di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from want of &s;ufficient Circulation in the Blood and Humours,
<PB REF="5">or from cold phlegmatick Juices, by giving the Blood a higher Degree of Motion, increa&s;ing the Spi|rits, and attenuating, di&s;&s;olving, and evacuating all ex|crementious Humours, and a&s;&s;imilating them that are good.</P>
<P N="5">V. They remove all kind of Stoppages, and the Di&s;ea&s;es depending upon 'em and Wind; and upon that &s;core cure many Di&s;ea&s;es of the Head and Brea&s;t, and almo&s;t all the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Belly.</P>
<P N="6">VI. But the Ca&s;es in which they are an admirable and almo&s;t an infallible Remedy are, 1. The In|firmities attending Old Age and Con&s;umptions, to which the little Well is an adequate Remedy. 2. The Stone and Gravel, which they not only cure by their expul&s;ive, but al&s;o by their ab&s;ter&s;ive and dilating Property. 3. The Gout and Rheumatick Pains, for which it is an unparallell'd Remedy. 4. The Scur+vy, Melancholy, and Maladies depending upon the Mind. 5. Vapours, and mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es of Women. 6. Colicks of all &s;orts. 7. All inward and out|ward Ulcers, if not too far gone. 8. All Scabs, Itch, periodical Inflammations, and other Breakings out of the Skin, if never &s;o rebellious.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The only Ca&s;es I have found the&s;e Waters di&s;agree with, are the Di&s;ea&s;es incident to the hot, florid, and pletherick Con&s;titutions of &s;ome &s;trong young People.</P>
