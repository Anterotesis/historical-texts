<HEAD>A True and Perfect Relation of a Strange and Mon&s;trous <HI>Whale,</HI> ca&s;t upon the Shore at <HI>Rings-End</HI> near <HI>Dublin</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the begin|ning of <HI>January 1678/9.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF your more weighty Imployments, to which great Worth and approved Abilities have de|&s;ervedly called you, can admit of any Diver|ti&s;ement, I hope you will not take it ill if I en|deavour to contribute towards it: E&s;pecially having Engaged my &s;elf to give a ju&s;t and due ac|count of &s;uch Occurrenc s as in this juncture of Af|fairs &s;hall happen here in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould be loath to di&s;turb your more &s;erious hours with Feigned Rumours, <HI>Chymaeras</HI> and Prodi|gious Tri&s;les of that nature to make up a Pamphlet;
<PB N="2" REF="3">but &s;uch things as have really happen'd, and are wor|thy of Ob&s;ervation; and whereof many thou&s;ands in this Nation have been Witne&s;&s;es, I may be the more confident to relate as real Truths; and con&s;equent|ly more fit to be communicated to your Knowledge.</P>
<P>About the latter end of the la&s;t Month, the year ended in an Angry humour; God grant the next may &s;hine upon us with more Benevolent Stars, and Crown the be&s;t of Kings His mo&s;t Gracious Maje&s;ty, with Length of dayes, Happy en&s;uing years, again&s;t all the malice of His Enemies and Envious Con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>On the 22d. of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, the Wind being at W.S.W. it blew a great Storm, but we heard of no lo&s;s of Shipping, only &s;ome few Merchantmen that fell foul one of another in our Harbour. This high Wind brought down &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of Snow, as hath not been &s;een in this Country for many years; which in few dayes being wa&s;ht away with the abundance of Rain that &s;ucceeded, and the great Floods that fell from the Mountains, cau&s;ed &s;o great a Fre&s;h, that &s;everal Meadows and I&s;lands about the River <HI>Liffy</HI> were overflown.</P>
<P>But what was the mo&s;t remarkable and worthy Ob|&s;ervation in this Occurrence, was a man who Swom down the River on a Hay-Cock. This man near a place called <HI>Killmanum</HI> near <HI>Dublin</HI> above the Bridge, en|deavouring to &s;ave a Cock of Hay that the Water
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">had encompa&s;&s;ed, leapt thereon with a Pole in his hand; his Ship was now afloat, and he had no &s;ooner got one foot aboard, but he was lanched forth into the main Current, and driven on with that &s;ucce&s;s, that he pa&s;t the Bridge without any Damage: When he arrived on the other &s;ide the Bridge, there were &s;e|veral Attempts made to &s;ave him, but the Rapidne&s;s of the Stream would admit of no help; only one Boat, which meeting full &s;ide with the Hay-Cook, was over|turn'd with two men it, who were both lo&s;t. At la&s;t more obliged to Providence then his skill in Steerage, when he expected no le&s;s then the Main Ocean for his Re|fuge, he was left in a &s;afe Harbour on <HI>Clantarf</HI> I&s;land betwixt <HI>Clantarf</HI> and <HI>Rings-end.</HI></P>
<P>This Adventure of the Hay-Merchant was the whole Di&s;cour&s;e and wonder of the Town, and had conti|nued &s;o yet, if the Sea, more fertile in Mon&s;trous Productions then the Land, had not afforded them new cau&s;e of Admiration: For the next day, (as if the Floods were weary of their Load and willing to di&s;|charge them&s;elves of &s;o great a Burden) was thrown on the Shore a <HI>Whale</HI> of &s;o va&s;t a Magnitude, as never yet was di&s;cover'd in the&s;e parts, or hardly ever &s;een in <HI>Bermudas</HI> their Native Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>It was taken up by <HI>Rings-end,</HI> within two Miles of <HI>Dublin,</HI> where it lyes as yet, the wonder and amaze|ment of all Spectators, who flock from all parts both of City and Country to &s;atisfie their Curio&s;ity with the &s;ight of this Prodigious Spectacle.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y">
<P>This Immen&s;e Body of boundle&s;s Natures begetting, as it exceeds all other Creatures in quantity of it ex|ceeds almo&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of inforcing a belief of the va&s;tne&s;s of its Dimen&s;ions on any &s;ave tho&s;e only that have been Spectators, and which I would not under|take to de&s;cribe unto you, had I not my &s;elf been an Eye Witne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is in Length 52 Foot, in Breadth proportionable, the Tail is 14 Foot broad when it is extended, the Fins of a Prodigious Length and Breadth, and the Head an|&s;werable to the Bulk of the Body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> his upper Jawes are &s;upported from the under part of his Mouth with a Beam of Oke of eight Foot long; the Tongue was in Length eight Foot and a half, of a proportionable Tinck|ne&s;s and Breadth; The Tongue being cut ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, I have &s;een many people pa&s;s through his Jawes, and &s;everal &s;tand upright in his Mouth at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;urprizing thing was this, when they had Di&s;&s;ected him of &s;everal Shoales of Fi&s;h, which they found in his Belly of all &s;orts whole and Undi+ge&s;ted, together with a Seaman intire in his Cloaths, (which being laid on the Shore by the &s;ide of the &s;aid <HI>Whale</HI>) was &s;oon di&s;covered by his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e and &s;everal other &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 chunk">ing by, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o be one of the two men that were overturnd by the Hay-Cock the day before.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">
<P>Many &s;trange Conjectures have been made of this prodigious Bulk; A&s;tronomers and A&s;trologers have pa&s;t their Judgments upon it, and &s;carce an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> wife of Cobler in Town but have had &s;omething to &s;ay to it; and no doubt but it will &s;erve the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> with Ra&s;hers and Di&s;cour&s;e for many dayes to come.</P>
<P>But for my part, all the Prediction I &s;hall draw from it; is that our Kings mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty &s;hall be now re&s;tored to a &s;tate of greater Glory and Security, (as he was formerly) to his lawful Kingdoms and Loyal People; delivered from the hands of all His Enemies and Bloody Con&s;pirators, again&s;t the Life and Sacred Per&s;on of &s;o Good, &s;o Gracious, and &s;o Indulgent a Prince.</P>
<P>Their de&s;ign being to Subvert Monarchy, and alter the Government, which by God and the Laws are E&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e His Maje&s;ties Realms.</P>
<P>Such a <HI>Whale</HI> was ca&s;t up in <HI>England</HI> in the time of the late U&s;urpation, a little before the time of His Maje&s;ties ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;toration: And another was ca&s;t a&s;hore at <HI>Carrig-Fergus</HI> in the North of this Country in the year 40. but that was very &s;mall in Compari&s;on of this.</P>
<P>And we His Maje&s;ties Faithful Subjects do heartily wi&s;h here, that this Miraculous Prodigy ca&s;t on this
<PB N="6" REF="5">Shore, may be a true Omen, and Pre&s;age the Down|fal of all &s;uch as were Con&s;enters, Abetters, or Con|trivers for carrying on this Horrible Plot, either again&s;t our mo&s;t Gracious King or Government, whom that God may long pre&s;erve again&s;t all their Con&s;piracies, is the Hearty Prayers and Wi&s;hes of</P>
