<P>_THat I here not only pre&s;ent you with the&s;e my weak Endea|vours, for the vigorous Im|provements of tho&s;e unparal|lel'd Advantages, which the &s;ituation of our Climate, the Nature of our Soil, and the Con&s;titution of both our People and Govern|ment affords us, in order to the making us every way great, beyond any Nation in the World; but have al&s;o at their peeping abroad into the &s;evere
<PB REF="4">light, taken the boldne&s;s to &s;eek their &s;helter un|der the &s;ecure umbrage of your joint Protections: your own real worth, which has de&s;ervedly pur|cha&s;ed each of you &s;uch great Honour and E&s;teem in the Brea&s;ts of all the Nation, is the only Ar|gument that I &s;hall plead for this pre&s;umption, it being &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for my Pardon. I could not imagine which way what I lay down in my Book, as matter of Fact, &s;hould in this un&s;tea|dy Age ever come to be put into Practice, with|out the favour and encouragement of tho&s;e who might not only obtain for it a free Acce&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, but &s;uch al&s;o who&s;e very &s;milings on its De&s;ign might be a &s;ufficient Shield to guard it again&s;t all the Arrows of Obloquy and Envy, that are u&s;ually &s;hot at the Projector, be the Un|dertaking never &s;o Noble. My humble Addre&s;s therefore to both your Honours is, That as one may be an Advocate for it to the Prince, who&s;e increa&s;e of Wealth, Strength, and Honour are the chief things aimed at in this Undertaking; &s;o the other may procure for it a favourable Recepti|on among&s;t tho&s;e honourable Gentlemen of the City, who&s;e Wealth and Grandeur are the chief &s;upport of Trade, and con&s;equently of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> the Improvement of which hath been my
<PB REF="4">whole &s;tudy for many years, and which I now make publick meerly out of a real love to my Country, who&s;e future flouri&s;hing is the only Reward I ever hope to &s;ee of all my Labours. Might I once but &s;ee our Titles to Lands and Hou&s;es &s;ecured, our Rivers made communicable, the Poor provided for by Bank Granaries, the Manufactures of the Land incouraged, and as the re&s;ult of all our Trade upon the Increa&s;e; I &s;hould not doubt then in few years to &s;ee this Kingdom enricht above Ten Millions <HI>per An.</HI> which is but a moderate Account of what Profit mu&s;t inevitably ari&s;e from a due Execution of the&s;e Rea&s;onable Propo&s;als.

<P>_FRom the great Incouragement your Lord|&s;hip hath been plea&s;ed to afford me, in tho&s;e indefatigable Pains you have ta|ken in the Survey of &s;everal Rivers, and contriving with me effectually which way the&s;e might be rendred &s;o far Navigable, that the Publick might thereby receive a general Advan|tage, I am emboldened to make my humble return of Thanks in this &s;mall Dedication; in which &s;hould I (as the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom is) enumerate your Lord&s;hips Favours wherewith you have been plea|&s;ed to honour me beyond my De&s;ert, although in &s;o doing I &s;hould only di&s;charge my Duty, yet the captious Reader would be apt to mi&s;-interpret my grateful Acknowledgments for crafty In&s;inua|tions,
<PB REF="6">as if de&s;ign'd only to court your Noble Pro|tection: And by declaring to the World how far your Lord&s;hip hath dived into the&s;e My&s;teries of Navigation, and what a fair Pro&s;pect you have given your Country of the great Profit nece&s;&s;ari|ly ari&s;ing from tho&s;e &V;ndertakings, I &s;hould give my Adver&s;aries occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect, that I make u&s;e of &s;o unquestionable a Testimony for one part of my Book, meerly in de&s;ign to wheedle them into an ea&s;ier credence of the whole. But I hope Your Lord&s;hip is a&s;&s;ured, that I have a greater vene|ration for your Honour, than to make a Stale of either your Name, Favour, or Authority; or that I &s;hould pre&s;ume to abu&s;e them on any occa&s;ion, as young Swimmers do their Bladders, with which they too too often boldly adventure beyond their depth. I know indeed &s;ome &s;peculative Gentle|men have of late plunged them&s;elves &s;o far into the deep, that they have not only &s;unk in their &V;ndertakings to their everla&s;ting reproach: but their Ignorance buoyed up with Pride being the only thing that hath been able to keep above water, they have given the World &s;ufficient Te&s;ts of the vast difference betwixt Speculative Notions and Pra|ctical Experiments.

<PB REF="6">experienced in Neighbour Nations, and the re&s;t &s;ufficiently proved, by &s;uch undeniable Demon&s;tra|tions, that I doubt not in &s;ome few Years to &s;ee <HI>England</HI> (in &s;pight of my Oppo&s;ers) a flouri&s;hing Kingdom.

<P>_THat I have not return'd you an earlier Account of tho&s;e Travels, in which out of a pure love to your Country you were plea&s;ed &s;ome years &s;ince to employ me, I had rather in few words &s;ubmit to your ju&s;t Reprehen&s;ion, than, by making a tedious Apo|logy, tell my Readers a long &s;tory, that little or nothing concerns them. It is I hope &s;ufficient that I acquaint them, that if from the Remarks I have made on the Ballance of <HI>Europe,</HI> or my &s;tu|dious prying into the curious intreagues of Trade, and the thriving Politicks of our Neighbour Na|tions, any Advantage &s;hall ari&s;e unto us in this
<PB REF="8">Kingdom, they mu&s;t with me return their Ac|knowledgments wholly to you, who&s;e Generous Souls not only engaged me at fir&s;t in the Under|taking, but al&s;o wholly maintained both me and my Interpreter throughout my Travels, in the que&s;t of &s;uch things, as my own Fortune would have proved too &s;lender to have otherwi&s;e acqui|red. But that I may not be condemned with the Sluggard for laying up my Talent in a Napkin, I herewith pre&s;ent you al&s;o an account of my choi|ce&s;t Ob&s;ervations and Practice for this twenty five years in Trade; in which &s;uch Secrets as the be|nefit of your Moneys gave me the advantage of finding out abroad, are at length by great pains and &s;tudy rendred all practicable here at home, and &s;o adapted to our own Climate and Con&s;titu|tions, that nothing but Sloth or Envy can po&s;&s;ib|ly hinder my Labours from being crown'd with their wi&s;ht for Succe&s;s: Our habitual fondne&s;s of the one hath already brought us to the brink of Ruine, and our pronene&s;s to the other almo&s;t di&s;couraged all Pious Endeavours to promote our future Happine&s;s. People confe&s;s they are &s;ick, Trade is in a Con&s;umption, the whole Na|tion langui&s;hes, and the Phy&s;ick pre&s;cribed is ve|ry proper and good, but &s;ome like not the Sea|&s;on,
<PB REF="8">and fain would put it off (like Repentance) &s;till a little longer, until at length it be too late. Others fancy not the Doctor, and &s;o re&s;olve not to like it becau&s;e his Advice.

And if by what I here pre&s;ent you, you find I have di&s;charged my Tru&s;t like a faithful Steward, your Approbation, as it will be the be&s;t Security again&s;t the Captious, it is likewi&s;e the highe&s;t Ambi|tion of,</P>

<P>_REader, thou mu&s;t take notice that all Kingdoms and Common-wealths in|crea&s;e in Strength and Riches, ac|cording as they are &s;ituated for Trade, and do convenience them&s;elves with ju&s;t and equal Laws and Customs, whereby they out-do the re&s;t of their Neighbours. We &s;ee of late years what great Conte&s;ts and bloody Wars have been betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and all to obtain the Mistre&s;s called <HI>Trade:</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants complaining how the <HI>Dutch</HI> out-trade them, and that they are not able to live. And &s;o in proce&s;s of time they and others under pretence of a&s;certaining the Merchants Rights blow up a War betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> which hath &s;eldom been compo&s;ed with a Peace but the Merchant goeth by the wor&s;t, and the People of <HI>England</HI> &s;eldom bettered, or the Trade advanced. And it being my fortune to be travelling, and at <HI>Dray&s;den</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Court, when the
<PB REF="10">&s;ad News came of the <HI>Dutch</HI> burning our Ships at <HI>Chattam,</HI> I made it then my bu&s;ine&s;s amongst other things I was employed in, to ob&s;erve as far as I could how and which way the Trade of <HI>England</HI> might be improved and advanced. And when I had made my Ob&s;ervations of the Trade there, and how far it was to be taken notice of in order to the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the like in <HI>England,</HI> to &s;et the Poor on work, which was the Linen, Thread, Tape, and Tin-plates, I came for <HI>Holland,</HI> being the time the Treaty was at <HI>Breda,</HI> where the Triple League was concluded, (<HI>viz.</HI>) between <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Swetheland.</HI> And there &s;pending &s;ome time in the ob&s;ervations of their Laws, Cu&s;toms, pub|lick Banks, Cut Rivers, Havens, Sands, Policies in Government and Trade, with their Natural Fortifications both by Sea and Land; weighing and con&s;idering all things, I was then &s;atisfied we could not beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> with fighting. And by long &s;tudying and weighing every part of their Condition, and al&s;o knowing &s;ome of our failings in the advance of Trade, and our weak Laws condu|cing thereunto, I did &s;ee that all was out of joint; and pur&s;uing the Cau&s;es thereof, in a &s;mall time it appeared to me that although we could not beat them with fighting, yet on the other hand it
<PB REF="10">was as clear to me that we might beat them without fighting; that being the best and ju&s;te&s;t way to &s;ubdue our Enemies. My fancy growing higher and higher, and knowing it might be acceptable &s;ervice to the Publick Good of the Kingdom, I di&s;cour&s;ed all parts and points now writ &s;ome hun|dreds of times, with &s;ome Lords, &s;ome Judges, Law|yers, Gentlemen, Merchants, Sea Officers, and Courtiers; and upon all that I could hear, and receiving all that could be &s;aid again&s;t it, I was the more confirmed it might be done; upon which I was incouraged by many, and &s;ome of them Law|yers, who offer'd me their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and help to make it ready for the Pre&s;s, which I was preparing for. But before I could compleat my intentions I received a Letter from a Friend in <HI>Flanders,</HI> wherein he acquainted me that there would be Wars between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and that the <HI>Dutch</HI> would be in great danger, and in proce&s;s of time <HI>Flanders</HI> al&s;o, and that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> would join against <HI>Holland:</HI> &V;pon which I made a Map, and put the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in two Squadrons at half Sea, and the <HI>French</HI> in one Squadron with them, and I put the <HI>Dutch</HI> in three Squadrons within their Sands and natural Holds, and did in the &s;ame Map underwrite the Rea&s;ons
<PB REF="11">here &s;et down in this Treati&s;e (why we might beat them without fighting) which Map was done three Weeks before the Breach was, which is ready to be produced, if by any de&s;ired: And I did then at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and in many other places, &s;hew by di&s;|cour&s;e the little fruits we might expect, and the great danger might en&s;ue in breaking the Ballance of <HI>Europe,</HI> it being then &s;o indifferently &s;ettled. But the Ballance being now broke, and under|&s;tanding the <HI>Dutches</HI> preparations, (as to build Great Ships,) I am &s;atisfied they aim at a larger Trade than ever, when opportunity offers it &s;elf, and will endeavour to carry the Flag in the Ea&s;t|ern Seas, and it's po&s;&s;ible &s;ome where el&s;e, if not prevented by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Therefore the&s;e few Sheets are &s;et abroad to &s;hew the World how they may be Beat without Fighting; and by no other ways than the Free Lands of <HI>England</HI> being put under a Voluntary Regi&s;ter by Act of Parliament: From the Credit whereof &s;pring Banks, Lumber|hou&s;es, with all Credits nece&s;&s;ary to drive Trade, Cut Rivers, the Fi&s;hery, and all things el&s;e that Mo|neys are capable of; and it will drive away the great fears and complaints rooted in the hearts of the People, as the decay of Trade, the growing Power of the <HI>French,</HI> and much more.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The true way to beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> at Sea without Fighting.</HEAD>
<P>_TO Beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> with Fighting is difficult, by rea&s;on of the great Advantages they have by their Sands and Holds all along the <HI>German</HI> Shore, from the Mouth of the <HI>Texel,</HI> and other <HI>Holland</HI> Rivers, un|to the Mouth or Influx of the <HI>Elbe:</HI> And within the&s;e Sands and Holds they lye clo&s;e and &s;afe as long as they plea&s;e, and we cannot come at them with our Ships; the Rea&s;on is, we draw five Foot Water with our Ships more than the <HI>Dutch</HI> do with theirs; and we mu&s;t lye beating at Sea, and receive all Storms and Accidents that the Seas and our Ships are lyable to, while
<PB N="2" REF="12">the <HI>Dutch</HI> are at Anchor within their defen&s;ible Sands and Holds, and upon their own Coa&s;ts, and there with ea&s;e may take in and be &s;upplyed with all manner of Ammu|nition, Provi&s;ion, and Men, with all other things they &s;tand in want of. And when the wind blows &s;trong at Ea&s;t, we mu&s;t bear away, and cannot keep our Station. The &s;ame wind that blows our Ships off, blows the <HI>Dutch</HI> out, and if they have a mind to follow us, they may; and when we are within &s;ome of our Bays they may come at us with ea&s;e: And as I &s;aid before, the rea&s;on is, we draw five Foot Water more with our Ships, than the <HI>Dutch</HI> do with theirs: They build for their Shores and Harbours, and we build for ours; and we &s;ee by experi|ence they make their Sea War only defen&s;ive, and &s;o will do untill they find them&s;elves &s;trong enough to ven|ture to fight at half Sea. And what a comfort is it to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to &s;ee their Fleet lye, &s;afe at Anchor near their own Shores, and their Enemies blown off by Storms and great Winds, and their Coa&s;ts in two hours time free, clear, and &s;afe from any Enemies? And when &s;uch an Accident falls out, they may immediately put to Sea their &s;everal trading Fleets.</P>
<P>Now that they have &s;uch Natural defen&s;es by rea&s;on of their Holds and Sands, was very difficult to make Gen|tlemen of great parts and knowledge believe. But the&s;e Natural fortifications and (I may &s;ay) pre&s;ervations are not only the protection of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but of like benefit to all the People Inhabiting the <HI>German</HI> Shore, from the Mouth of the <HI>Texel</HI> and other <HI>Holland</HI> Rivers, unto the Mouth of the <HI>Elbe:</HI> And the <HI>Dutch</HI> may now and at all times by the help of the&s;e Sands and Holds &s;ail with their Smacks and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, of which they have great numbers, forth of the <HI>Texel</HI> clear along the <HI>Friezland</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="12">and <HI>Bremen</HI> Shore into the <HI>Emes, We&s;er,</HI> and <HI>Elbe,</HI> to fetch in all manner of Provi&s;ions for <HI>Holland,</HI> which may be had plentifully down the <HI>Emes, We&s;er,</HI> and <HI>Elbe;</HI> and from <HI>Hamburgh</HI> all manner of Naval Stores, while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t look on, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly come at them.</P>
<P>And if their Men of War are &s;o &s;ecured by their Sands and Holds, and that the Smacks and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els may creep Ea&s;tward by help of them, and fetch in Provi&s;ions and Naval Stores uninterrupted; Then it is very clear and evident, they are not to be beat, War being made upon them, they acting their parts only defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay &s;omething of their Natural and Artificial fortifications in <HI>Holland, Zealand,</HI> and <HI>Friezland,</HI> having Surveyed many of their great Towns. For it is of great advantage to the Naval Power of <HI>Holland,</HI> that their three Maritime Provinces are &s;o &s;trengthned by Art and Nature. And it is of like great advantage to the three Maritime Provinces that their Naval powers and force are &s;o defen&s;ively &s;ecured by the Sands and Holds upon theirs and the <HI>German</HI> Shores.</P>
<P>I have &s;everal years in Publick in the hearing of &s;ome hundreds of Gentlemen given the &s;ame rea&s;ons which now I here put in Print; And I have often heard many Gentlemen &s;ay and &s;wear they might be fetched forth and de&s;troyed, and &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e was only by Per&s;ons Dutchify'd; Some of which Per&s;ons, as they &s;ince have told me, did intend to get me &s;ecured for &s;etting but the &s;trength of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and &s;peaking of a <HI>Publick Regi&s;ter,</HI> as they then thought, was &s;peaking again&s;t the Laws. But &s;ince tho&s;e Gentlemen are my Converts, and have pre&s;&s;ed me hard &s;everal times to know what was the rea|&s;on
<PB N="4" REF="13">applicable unto the <HI>German</HI> Shores than to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I promi&s;ed them that it &s;hould come forth in Print, for their and all other Gentlemens &s;atisfaction; and I am &s;ure it is worth the knowing: And it is as nece&s;&s;ary to be per|fectly known by all Mini&s;ters of State in <HI>Europe,</HI> as it is for them to know where the Ballance of <HI>Europe</HI> is be&s;t to be lodged for their Princes good. And I affirm that this ought by many Princes, who intend a Sea War, to be the fir&s;t thing taken into con&s;ideration. For who&s;oever will make a Sea War mu&s;t not promi&s;e him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t all Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In di&s;covering to you the true Rea&s;ons of the&s;e Sands and Holds, I mu&s;t &s;hew you the length of the Rivers of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> with the nature of the Land and Soyl the Rivers run through, with the advantage the Winds give in making the&s;e Holds and Sands; and how the Winds clear our Sands, and help to deepen our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Rivers.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t People think it very &s;trange, That in our three great Rivers in <HI>England,</HI> (viz.) <HI>Thames, Humber,</HI> and <HI>Severn,</HI> we &s;hould have five Foot Water more at the Mouth or Influx than is at the Influx of the <HI>Texel, Rhine, Emes, We&s;er,</HI> or <HI>Elbe,</HI> upon the <HI>German</HI> Coa&s;t; none of our Rivers running above one hundred and fifty Miles, and &s;ome of the <HI>German</HI> Rivers running one thou&s;and Miles; And it &s;tands to Rea&s;on, the farther the Rivers run, and the more Water is in them, the deeper they &s;hould be at the Influx.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve how the Winds blow, and how the Rivers lye to be Commanded by them. And &s;econdly, you mu&s;t con&s;ider from whence the Rivers come, and whither they run, either through Clay, Gra|velly, or Sandy Lands. The Winds blow at South and
<PB N="5" REF="13">We&s;t two Thirds of the year, and the&s;e Winds are great and &s;trong, and have their Gu&s;ts and force upon the Mouths of the <HI>German</HI> Rivers; and when there are great Rains in <HI>Germany,</HI> and upon the Borders of <HI>Poland,</HI> where are great Sands, it brings them down into the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and &s;o down to the Mouth or Influx therof; where often it meets with a South or We&s;t Wind, and the Tide and Wind coming in both together, force the Sands into Beds, which by degrees increa&s;e to great Banks, and &s;o alter the Channel, and in proce&s;s of time work them|&s;elves by new Fre&s;hes down the <HI>Elbe</HI> into the Sea, and then the Winds and Tide trouls them, and give them a &s;ettlement along the Shores. And the like it doth at the Mouth or Influx of all the great Rivers on the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> Shores. And as long as the Winds blow, and the Rivers run as now they do, the&s;e Natural forti|fications and pre&s;ervations by Sea &s;hall be to the People inhabiting the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The true Rea&s;ons now being made plain, I de&s;ire the Reader to con&s;ider (if this I have &s;aid be true) which is more advi&s;eable; an hazardous War by Sea, or to bring to pa&s;s the things that will beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> without fighting?</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on wherefore the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Rivers draw five Foot Water more than the <HI>German</HI> Rivers do at the Mouth or Influx is, becau&s;e they run not above one hundred and fifty Miles, and through Clay, and Gra|velly Land, which &s;ort of Soyl &s;ends but little quantity of Sand down into the great Fre&s;hes. And our South and We&s;t Winds being great, and blowing, as I &s;aid be|fore, two parts in three in the year at tho&s;e Points, force out the Sands, and &s;end them into the Ocean; And up|on &s;ome certain Tides, force them over to help to aug|ment
<PB N="6" REF="14">the Holds on the <HI>German</HI> Shore. Ob&s;erve but the Mouth of the River <HI>Dee</HI> that runs by <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> which lyes in the Face of the South and We&s;t Winds, and there you will find the Winds and Tides have done the like; By which at this pre&s;ent a Ve&s;&s;el of twenty Tuns can|not come loaded to that Old Noble Town of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>But now it is time to begin to &s;hew you how we may beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> without fighting? To beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> with fighting, &s;o as to force them from their beloved Mi&s;tri&s;s and delight, (which is Trade and Riches thereby) hath been the de&s;ign of mo&s;t of their Neighbours for this forty years la&s;t pa&s;t, who thought thereby to bring that Mi&s;tre&s;s of Trade to leave that People, and betake her &s;elf to a place of better Ports, and healthfuller Air. To which purpo&s;e upon the end of War betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> many advantageous Articles have been agreed upon, and &s;ome good Laws made to encourage Trade and the Merchants: But I &s;ee although we get this Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Love, it is but for a &s;hort time; &s;he is &s;till endeavouring to be gone, and &s;eat her &s;elf in that dull and flegmatick Air. And the Rea&s;ons wherefore &s;he doth &s;o, and will do &s;o, I will here di&s;cover unto you.</P>
<P>All Kingdoms and Common-wealths in the World that depend upon Trades, common <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> is as nece&s;&s;a|ry and needful in them, as Di&s;cipline is in an Army, and where is want of common Hone&s;ty in a Kingdom or Commonwealth, from thence Trade &s;hall depart. For as the Hone&s;ty of all Governments is, &s;o &s;hall be their <HI>Riches;</HI> And as their <HI>Honour, Hone&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>Riches</HI> are, &s;o will be their <HI>Strength;</HI> And as their <HI>Honour, Hone&s;ty, Riches,</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> are, &s;o will be their <HI>Trade.</HI> The&s;e are five Si&s;ters that go hand in hand, and mu&s;t not be parted. All people that know any thing of <HI>Holland,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="14">know that the people there pay great Taxes, and eat dear, maintain many Souldiers both by Sea and Land; and in the three Maritime Provinces have neither good Water nor good Air: And that in &s;ome of the Provin|ces they pay Fifty years Purcha&s;e for their Lands, and are many times &s;ubject to be de&s;troyed by the devouring waves of the Sea's overflowing their Banks. And not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e &s;trange, and unheard Inconveni|ences, yet they will not quit their Station, and remove to places of more &s;afety and le&s;s Taxes (though never &s;o civilly treated.) The Rea&s;on whereof is, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They have fitted them&s;elves with a Publick Regi&s;ter of all their Lands and Hou&s;es, whereby it is made Ready Mo|neys at all times, without the charge of Law, or the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a Lawyer. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By making Cut Rivers Navigable in all places where Art can po&s;&s;ibly effect it; thereby making Trade more Communicable and Ea&s;ie than in other places. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By a Publick Bank, the great Sinews of Trade, the Credit thereof making Pa|per go in Trade equal with Ready Money, yea better in many parts of the World than Money. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> A Court of Merchants to end all differences betwixt Mer|chant and Merchant. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> A Lumber-hou&s;e, where|by all poor people may have Moneys lent upon Goods at very ea&s;ie Intere&s;t. As I have &s;hewed you their Strength before, now in the&s;e five Particulars you may &s;ee their Policie, upon which lies all their Happine&s;s and Wel|fare. By the&s;e Policies of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the want of our Lands being put under a Regi&s;ter, One hundred pounds a year in <HI>Holland</HI> at this pre&s;ent time will rai&s;e a Family &s;ooner, and drive a better and more profitable Trade, than a man can do of a Thou&s;and pounds a year in <HI>England.</HI> But if we write by their Copies, we &s;hall
<PB N="8" REF="15">do the great things they now do, and I dare &s;ay out-do them too.</P>
<P>Now I will demon&s;trate to all men unbia&s;&s;ed the truth of what I a&s;&s;ert, and &s;hew them the Condition the Gen|tlemen and People of <HI>England</HI> are in at this day; and al|&s;o the Condition the <HI>Dutch</HI> are in at this day in all their Provinces. Let a Gentleman now in <HI>England</HI> that hath a Thou&s;and pounds a year Land, that owes Four thou|&s;and pounds, come to a Money Scrivener, and de&s;ire Four thou&s;and pounds to be lent him on all his Land, and produce his Writings, and the E&s;tate hath been in the Family Two hundred years; I know at this day the An&s;wer will be, that by the Law of <HI>England</HI> as it is now practis'd, no man can know a Title by Writings, there being &s;o many ways to incumber the Land privately: And therefore the An&s;wer commonly is, Bring us Secu|rity for the Covenants, and we will lend you the Moneys. The Gentleman gets &s;uch Friends as he can procure to be bound for his Covenants, whom if they accept, then the Procurator and Continuator have their Game to play: But if he bring not &s;uch Security as they like, he goeth without this Four thou&s;and pounds; which is a &s;ad and lamentable ca&s;e, he having Lands worth a Thou&s;and pounds a year. And now he is put to his &s;hifts, his Cre|ditors come upon him, the charge of Law-&s;uits comes on, all his Affairs are di&s;tracted, his Sons and Daughters want Money to &s;et them into the World. At la&s;t it is po&s;&s;ible he gets Two thou&s;and pounds a piece of two &s;e|veral Per&s;ons, of one at <HI>York,</HI> and of the other at <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and Mortgages all his Lands to each man: This con|tinues private for &s;ome years: The while the Gentleman &s;trives what he can to be hone&s;t, and prepare Moneys to pay off one of the Mortgages: But it commonly falls
<PB N="9" REF="15">out otherwi&s;e, either through bad Times, or decay of Tenants, great Taxes, or the Elde&s;t Son matching con|trary to his Father's will, or oftentimes it is wor&s;e, he is &s;o debaucht no one will match with him: Now the Gen|tleman's mi&s;eries come on, and what mu&s;t he then do? for the per&s;ons that have the Lands Mortgaged will not &s;tay, becau&s;e by this time it is di&s;cover'd the Land is twice mortgaged. I tell you the Lawyers Harve&s;t is now come in, and the E&s;tate torn to pieces, and the Gentleman, his Wife and Family, and it may be Credi|tors too undone. For &s;eeing all is in danger to be gone, the Friends of the Wife Trump up a former Title to the two Mortgages, and fence to get all the E&s;tate that She|riff, Bayliffs, Sollicitors, and Lawyers leave, to be to the U&s;es intended or pretended in the Private Settlement. But you will ask me, What the poor Gentleman &s;hall do to &s;ecure his Per&s;on? I will tell you what &s;ome have done, and many more I know mu&s;t do, even turn over either to the <HI>Fleet</HI> or <HI>Bench.</HI> O <HI>Pity,</HI> and <HI>Sin,</HI> that it &s;hould be &s;o in brave <HI>England! Fir&s;t, Pity</HI> that a poor Gentleman cannot have Moneys at &s;uch intere&s;t upon his Land, as the Law directs, to pay his ju&s;t Debts, and for the good and comfort of his Family. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It is a <HI>Sin,</HI> that a Gentleman of a Thou&s;and pounds a year &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of ruining &s;o many Families as he does, by putting them to &s;uch vexatious Suits for their Moneys lent, and it may be at la&s;t lo&s;e all.</P>
<P>And that you may further &s;ee the badne&s;s of the Land Security at this day, take the&s;e two Accompts. In the Country where I live, I have been a Commi&s;&s;ioner in the Third part of the greate&s;t E&s;tates in the County, wherein I have &s;een the Settlements two ways, and ma|ny of them proved which are lying dormant, and &s;o
<PB N="10" REF="16">will do. The Civil Wars were the occa&s;ion of the&s;e Settlements. And in the next County an Attorney (<HI>Ni|cholas Phillpot</HI> of <HI>Hereford</HI>) about four years &s;ince put out in print two Sheets, to &s;hew Rea&s;ons wherefore a Regi|&s;ter of Lands is needful: And among&s;t the re&s;t, this is one: <HI>For,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>in the County where I live, I know men that have deceived, and are deceived, to the value of Forty thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides what all others know.</HI> And whoever perfectly knows that Country will &s;ay, none in <HI>England</HI> out-does it as to benefit the life of man: But Ho|nour and Hone&s;ty being decayed, Riches will not &s;tay. I am &s;orry I mu&s;t make &s;uch a Di&s;covery of the badne&s;s and uncertainty of Titles, but if the wound be not &s;earch|ed to the bottom, there will be no hope of a Cure.</P>
<P>In this po&s;ture as you &s;ee are many poor men in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which cannot borrow Four thou&s;and pounds of a Thou&s;and pounds a year Land. I pray let us &s;ee what a po&s;ture a <HI>Dutchman</HI> &s;tands in, that hath One hundred pounds a year, and wants Four thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Now I am a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> and have One hundred pounds a year in the Province of <HI>We&s;t-Friezland</HI> near <HI>Groningen,</HI> and I come to the Bank at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and there tender a Particular of my Lands, and how tenanted, being One hundred pounds a year in <HI>We&s;t-Friezland,</HI> and de&s;ire them to lend me Four thou&s;and pounds, and I will Mort|gage my Land for it. The An&s;wer will be, I will &s;end by the Po&s;t to the Regi&s;ter of <HI>Groningen</HI> your Particular, and at the return of the Po&s;t you &s;hall have your An&s;wer. The Regi&s;ter of <HI>Groningen</HI> &s;ends An&s;wer, It is my Land and tenanted according to the Particular. There is no more words, but tell out your Moneys. OBSERVE all you that read this, and tell to your Children this &s;trange thing, <HI>That Paper in</HI> Holland <HI>is equal with Mo|neys
<PB N="11" REF="16">in</HI> England. I refu&s;e the Moneys, I tell him I do not want Moneys, I want credit, and having one Son at <HI>Venice,</HI> one at <HI>Newemberge,</HI> one at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and one at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where Banks are, I de&s;ire four Tickets of Credit, each of them for a Thou&s;and pounds, with Let|ters of Advice directed to each of my Sons, which is im|mediately done, and I Mortgage my Lands at Three in the Hundred. Reader, I pray Ob&s;erve, that every Acre of Land in the Seven Provinces trades all the world over, and it is as good as ready Money; but in <HI>England</HI> a poor Gentleman cannot take up Four thou&s;and pounds upon his Land at &s;ix in the hundred Intere&s;t, although he would Mortgage a Thou&s;and pounds a year for it. No and many Gentlemen at this day of Five hundred pounds a year in Land, cannot have credit to live at a Twelve|penny Ordinary. If this be &s;o, it is very clear and evi|dent, that a man with One hundred pounds a year in <HI>Holland</HI> &s;o convenienced as their Titles are, and at the paying but three in the Hundred Intere&s;t for the Moneys lent, may &s;ooner rai&s;e Three Families, than a Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> can either rai&s;e One, or pre&s;erve the Family in being, for the Rea&s;ons already given. But were the Free Lands of <HI>England</HI> under a voluntary Regi&s;ter, all the&s;e Mi&s;eries would vani&s;h, and the Lands would come to Thirty years Purcha&s;e, which I &s;hall &s;hew you in its proper place.</P>
<P>But I know you would under&s;tand the Rea&s;on, why a <HI>West-Friezland</HI> man may have Four thou&s;and pounds up|on a Hundred pounds a year?</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, Becau&s;e there the Land is worth Fifty years Purcha&s;e. And after the Four thou&s;and pounds is lent, the Party that owns the Land may, if he plea&s;e, at the &s;maller Bank at <HI>Groningen</HI> take up Six hundred pounds
<PB N="12" REF="17">more in Bank Dollers, upon the &s;ame Hundred pounds a year: For Credit is given to the value of the Land within Two years Purcha&s;e of what the Land goeth at.</P>
<P>I can both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> Regi&s;ter my Wedding, my Burial, and my Chri&s;tening, and a poor Pari&s;h Clerk is intru&s;ted with the keeping of the Book; and that which is Regi&s;ter'd there, is good by our Law: But I can|not Regi&s;ter my Lands to be hone&s;t to pay every man his own, to prevent tho&s;e &s;ad things that attend Families for want thereof, and to have the great benefit and advan|tage that would come thereby. A Regi&s;ter will quicken Trade, and the Land Regi&s;tred will be equal as Ca&s;h in a mans hands, and the Credit thereof will go and do in Trade what Ready Moneys now doth. Ob&s;erve how it advanceth Trade in <HI>Holland,</HI> and of how little Advan|tage it is to the Trade of <HI>England.</HI> I having One hun|dred pounds a year in <HI>Holland,</HI> meet with a Merchant up|on the <HI>Exchange</HI> at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and agree with him for Goods to the value of Four thou&s;and pounds for &s;ix Months: If he demands Security, I go to the Bank, and give him Security by a Ticket of my Land, and by the Credit of that Ticket the Merchant is immediately in Trade again as high as the Commodity was he &s;old. But if I make a Bargain at <HI>London</HI> for Four thou&s;and pounds worth of Goods for &s;ix Months, the next di&s;cour&s;e is, What Security? Then the Buyer and the Seller agree to meet at the Tavern at Four of the Clock in the After|noon: There the Buyer produceth his Security, many times not approved of; &s;o the Merchant cannot put off his Commodities, nor the Chapman have the Goods he &s;tands in need of. But if the Buyer or any Friend of his, that would Credit him, had Land under a Regi&s;ter, then a Ticket upon &s;uch Lands given to the Merchant would
<PB N="13" REF="17">be equal to him as Ready Moneys; and I &s;ay better too.</P>
<P>It is the common mi&s;take of the world who cry up the <HI>Dutch</HI> for a great Ca&s;h in Bank, it is not &s;o, it is a great mi&s;take; For it is a Bank of Credit, and Paper is in that Bank equal with Moneys, the Anchorage, Fund and Foundation being laid Safe: And that is the Lands being under a Regi&s;ter, from whence i&s;&s;ue the&s;e delightful Golden Streams of Banks, Lumber-hou&s;es, Honour, Hone&s;ty, Riches, Strength and Trade. You may read in Sir <HI>William Temples</HI> Book of his Ob&s;ervations of the <HI>Nether-lands</HI> this Expre&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P><HI>When the States &s;end to Per&s;ons who have lent them Moneys to come and receive their Moneys and Intere&s;t,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>they come with Tears in their Eyes de&s;iring them to continue it longer:</HI> And the Rea&s;on is, they know the Security is good. And when ever they give Notice they will take up a Sum of Moneys, there is great &s;triving who can get in his fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, I talk that Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> cannot have Moneys for Land; It is not &s;o: And that I &s;ay Lawyers know no Titles, I ought to have my pate crackt; for money is plentiful, and Lawyers are cunning enough to &s;py out good Titles.</P>
<P>As to both I would it were true, for the &s;ake of the poor Gentlemen, and the Lawyers too. But as to the greate&s;t part of them, that have Thou&s;and pounds a year, the World knows they are &s;o far from borrowing Four thou&s;and pounds, that they cannot borrow Four hundred pounds; and I dare &s;ay &s;ome Lords al&s;o.</P>
<P>Nay, to my knowledge three eminent Lawyers have been put to much charge and trouble, in their E&s;tates lately purcha&s;ed by them, in <HI>Montgomery, Hereford,</HI> and
<PB N="14" REF="18"><HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Shires, by rea&s;on of former Incumbrances. Now if an Eminent Lawyer cannot purcha&s;e an E&s;tate with|out &s;o much trouble, hazard, and charge, upon a Title &s;ettled at lea&s;t fifty years ago by all the Judges of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and in the Exchequer-Chamber; upon what Se|curity can the Bankers be under&s;tood to lay out their Mo|ney &s;afe? And the poor Country-men are yet in a wor&s;e condition.</P>
<P>I will now &s;hoot a Granado into <HI>London,</HI> not to fire them, but I hope 'twill make them look about them, and enquire after the Engineer, and demand how &s;uch com|bu&s;tible matter can be made, and do good and no harm, and how it may be fixt, &s;o that <HI>Lumbard-&s;treet</HI> and there|abouts may both pre&s;erve and encrea&s;e their Credit. I will now &s;hew you the Condition of <HI>London,</HI> as at pre|&s;ent it &s;tands, and how it would have been, if the Hou|&s;es new built had been by Law to be Regi&s;terd at <HI>Guild-Hall.</HI> Admit the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> Tavern in <HI>Fleet Street</HI> were mine, and Set at One hundred pounds a year, and I owe &s;ix hundred pounds, and go to the Scriveners and de&s;ire them to lend me &s;ix hundred pounds upon the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> Tavern. I Shew them the Purcha&s;e of the Ground Rent, the Patent from the Judges taken in, and all other Titles bought. I pre&s;ume I cannot have the Six hundred pounds upon my hou&s;e, but I mu&s;t give great Security for my Covenants. I pre&s;ent &s;uch Security as I can get, which will not be accepted. Now for want of this &s;ix hundred pounds, on a &s;udden to pay my Debts, I am undone, Wife, Children and many more whom I owed moneys to, my Goods &s;eized, my Hou&s;e taken from me, and it's po&s;&s;ible a Pri&s;on too, or a Sta|tute of Bankrupt taken out, to the Ruine of all. But if it had been fore&s;een when the Act pa&s;t for the building
<PB N="15" REF="18">the City, that there had been put into the Bill the&s;e few Lines, <HI>Be it Enacted by the Kings mo&s;t Excel|lent Maje&s;ty.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That all Hou&s;es which &s;hall hereafter be new built in and near the City of</HI> London, <HI>de&s;troyed by the late dreadful Fire, may (if they plea&s;e) he Regi&s;tred by the Owners at the</HI> Guild-Hall <HI>within the City of</HI> London; <HI>And all &s;uch Hou&s;es &s;o Regi&s;tred, &s;hall be a good Title to the Party Regi&s;tring &s;uch Hou|&s;es, and &s;hall Barre all per&s;ons what&s;oever, The King not Excepted; Provided there be no Claym entred within &s;ix Months next after the Regi&s;tring of &s;uch Hou&s;e and Hou&s;es; And &s;uch Clayms as are entred &s;hall be pro|ceeded upon in the &s;aid City, and no where el&s;e, in due form as the Law directs.</HI> And if this had been done, I then go to any Scrivener that deals that way, and de&s;ire to borrow a Thou&s;and pounds on the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> Tavern in <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> being Rented at One hundred pounds a year; there will be then no more to be done, but their Servant is &s;ent to the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> to &s;ee who&s;e the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> Tavern is, and he brings word it is mine; There is no more ado, I &s;ay, but the Thou&s;and pounds is told out, and I give Security for it by a Mortgage put into the Regi&s;ter of my Hou&s;e. Then I go and pay my Debts, prevent Law-&s;uits, pre&s;erve my &s;elf, Wife, Children, and Reputation, and all is well: And that which is be&s;t of all, the Party lending the Mo|neys is &s;afe, well and &s;urely &s;ecured. It is po&s;&s;ible great part of the Thou&s;and pounds lent might be the Moneys of poor Widows and Orphans, here are both to the Lender and borrower great Advantages; To the one there is undeniable Security, and to the other pre&s;ent Re|lief
<PB N="16" REF="19">upon all occa&s;ions. The wanting whereof hath been the ruine of &s;ome thou&s;and Families &s;ince the firing of <HI>London.</HI> And this is that which will encrea&s;e and enli|ven Trade; and the Hou&s;es Regi&s;tred will be equal with ready Moneys at all times, according to the value of the Hou&s;es. And if this we treat on had been done, there needed not one Hou&s;e to &s;tand empty and untenanted, as now they do; nor the Trade to depart out of the City, as it hath done &s;ince the Fire. I de&s;ire and heartily wi&s;h that the Governours of the City would prepare a Bill again&s;t the next Sitting of Parliament to put the new Buildings under a Regi&s;ter. I will not Prophe&s;ie that a Bank &s;hall ri&s;e in <HI>London</HI> equal with that of <HI>Am&s;terdam, London</HI> being put under a voluntary Regi&s;ter; but I will make it out, when ever the Heads of the City plea&s;e to de&s;ire it, That if <HI>London,</HI> with the Free Lands of <HI>Mid|dle&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Surrey</HI> were under a voluntary Regi&s;ter; two of the Ridings of <HI>York&s;hire, Lincolne&s;hire, Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk</HI> were under another voluntary Regi|&s;ter; <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Monmouth&s;hire</HI> under another voluntary Regi&s;ter; and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> under another; then there would be as great a Bank at <HI>London</HI> as at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and would be able to do much more in Trade, Credit, and all great things, than they can; and as great a Bank at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> as at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and would be able to drive as great a Trade, and &s;et up the neglected, and I may &s;ay decayed Trade of Fi&s;hing upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and as great Banks at the two Towns of <HI>Lynne</HI> in <HI>Norfolk</HI> and at <HI>Hull</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and drive as good a Trade as at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and enliven the Clothing Trade now brought very low, and &s;et on foot that great and de&s;irable Rich Trade of Fi&s;hing on their Coa&s;ts, which &s;o advantageou&s;ly offers it &s;elf. (O yes,
<PB N="17" REF="19">O yes, O yes, what is become of the Moneys given vo|luntarily for the &s;etting forward this good work of Fi&s;h|ing about twelve years &s;ince? If any one will help me to the twenty &s;hillings I gave, I will give him nineteen for his pains.) And as great a Bank at <HI>Exeter</HI> as at <HI>No|remberge,</HI> and give life and &s;trength to the great Wollen Manufacture in all the We&s;t of <HI>England.</HI> For no great things can be done without a Bank, and no Bank can be of any benefit to Trade, and the Publick, but where there is a Regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>And I would have the mi&s;taken world know, that a Bank is as &s;afe and practicable in a Kingdom, as in a Common-wealth, and particularly in an I&s;land that is convenient for Trade. And the Rea&s;on why it is &s;o, is, becau&s;e it is a Bank of Credit, not of Ca&s;h, as is the Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, who&s;e Trea&s;ures are abroad in Trade and increa&s;ing, and only the Books in the Offices. I &s;ay it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep a Bank from ri&s;ing in this Kingdom, nay many Banks, if we were under a voluntary Regi&s;ter. But now the Land Credit and the City Bank Credit are both di&s;paraged; therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible that Trade can any way be &s;e|cured or bettered. And for per&s;ons behind-hand and in debt they mu&s;t expect mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Of late years the monied Men in <HI>England</HI> &s;ent their Moneys into <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> and there received a Note from a Gold&s;miths Boy, which was all they had to &s;hew for their Moneys. And certainly there was a Rea&s;on wherefore the great monied men did take &s;uch &s;lender Security for their Moneys; The Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e the Land Security was &s;o uncertain and bad, and it was &s;o trouble&s;ome and chargeable getting their Moneys again when they had occa&s;ion to u&s;e it, that forc't them
<PB N="18" REF="20">to <HI>Lombard-&s;treet.</HI> For two parts in three that put their Moneys into the&s;e uncertain <HI>Banks,</HI> know better how to lay their Moneys out in Land Security, than any of the banking Gold&s;miths or Merchants either. But the Land Security being not good, the Moneys tumbled into the wrong Channel. And all per&s;ons that have de&s;igns to get con&s;iderable Sums of Moneys into their hands for in|tended de&s;igns, or hazardous adventures, apply them|&s;elves to the Money-Bankers, and there make their ap|proaches by noble Treats, great Offers, with large Inte|re&s;t, with Country Baronets, Knights, E&s;quires, and it's po&s;&s;ible &s;ome Citizens al&s;o for Security; and at la&s;t creep into the credit of borrowing great Sums of Money upon Land Mortgaged twice or thrice before, for in the Country none could be borrowed. At length the <HI>Banker</HI> calls for his Moneys, but none can be paid. The <HI>Banker</HI> dares not adventure to &s;ue; but all that he dare do, is to employ a Lawyer only to whi&s;per (not to make a noi&s;e) or give him &s;ome private Duns; for if he &s;ues or falls on, that would cau&s;e the per&s;on that credited the <HI>Banker</HI> to call in his Moneys, and &s;o the <HI>Banker's</HI> Credit would be &s;poiled; therefore all is to be &s;ilent and hu&s;h. The <HI>Banker</HI> by this time &s;eeth and knoweth his condition, now he ca&s;ts about how to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from the Storm ap|proaching, and it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome con&s;iderable Creditor by this time &s;pies &s;ome bad Bargains made by the <HI>Banker,</HI> and calls in his Moneys: His earne&s;tne&s;s puts on others to do the like, and then all his Creditors crowd to him as Pigs do through a hole to a Bean and Pea&s;e Rick. Now the <HI>Banker</HI> &s;tands upon his guard, &s;peaks fair to &s;ome, prevails with others to have patience a while; and in the mean time he advi&s;es not his Creditors, but his own intere&s;t. Now by the importunity of his Wife and
<PB N="19" REF="20">Friends, he &s;ecures perhaps Two or Three Thou&s;and pounds free from all Peoples approaches. Then you &s;hall have him make Offers, and prays Time, proffers his Books to be &s;urveyed, and &s;aith that he will be ju&s;t, and hath husbanded the Moneys with ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty. The Books are pre&s;ented, the major part of the Creditors proclaim that there is E&s;tate &s;ufficient to pay all. So the minor Creditors mu&s;t be concluded. And then Time is given to pay by degrees, and Bond is given for the Pay|ment: But by whom? Even by the <HI>Bankers</HI> them&s;elves. A brave Security! but if their Books were &s;urveyed by Per&s;ons that know Men, and the Securities that are gi|ven, it is not to be que&s;tioned but Sir <HI>Foplin Flutter</HI> and E&s;quire <HI>Nipp</HI> have good part of the Moneys upon the Mortgages of Lands, Mannors, and Tenements, and great part as ea&s;ie to be recovered as it is to bring <HI>Penmen|moor</HI> and <HI>Gore Agoluath</HI> together, being the two great Mountains in North <HI>Wales.</HI> And it is po&s;&s;ible that great part of tho&s;e Moneys are ventured to Sea by Merchants; and rather than their Friend the Gold&s;mith &s;hall &s;uffer, he &s;hall &s;hut up Shop and go to Sea with his Merchant, and bring home the &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;t E&s;tate, and at his return pay God knows what.</P>
<P>It is probable that any man that &s;ends his Moneys into any of the&s;e <HI>Banks</HI> will conclude it impo&s;&s;ible to employ &s;o great Ca&s;h, as they are intru&s;ted with, any other way than by lending upon Land Security, or to Merchants to venture to Sea, or to Citizens and others upon Per&s;onal Security. And if the Ca&s;h can be employed no other way, then the Lender mu&s;t conclude the <HI>Banker</HI> is not able to &s;ecure the Moneys, but mu&s;t run the hazard of bad Security by Land, and &s;uch hazards at Sea as attend Merchants, with the badne&s;s and uncertainty of Per&s;onal
<PB N="20" REF="21">Security. And it is not to be imagin'd there being &s;uch great Ca&s;h put into the <HI>Bankers</HI> hands, that they &s;hould &s;tand to the lo&s;s of all moneys mi&s;ventur'd by tru&s;ting and bad Securities: And it mu&s;t be madne&s;s for the <HI>Bankers</HI> to keep the moneys in their Che&s;ts by them, unle&s;s they in|tend to keep part for them&s;elves, and pay part, and then lay the Key under the Door. I beg this one que&s;tion of &s;uch Country Gentlemen as have put their moneys into the <HI>Bankers</HI> hands, Whether they do not know better how to lay out their moneys on Land Security than the <HI>Bankers</HI> do? Yes I know they do ten to one better; for they partly know Titles that may be indifferent certain, and know the Reputations of the Per&s;ons better than the <HI>Bankers,</HI> as I have &s;et down before. And if there can be no Security given to the <HI>Bankers</HI> more than I have &s;et down, then in the name of God let them that have a mind to proceed further with them go on and pro&s;per if they can.</P>
<P>But it will be Objected, That I am no Friend to the way of Banking as now it is. I do profe&s;s it, and have been of the &s;ame mind this ten years la&s;t pa&s;t; and have declared before &s;ome of the <HI>Bankers</HI> and many Per&s;ons of Quality be&s;ides, that this way of banking would endan|ger the Kingdom. And when I &s;aw it convenient, which was in <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, I gave Rea&s;ons in Publick Coffee-hou&s;es for my Opinion, &s;ome of the <HI>Bankers</HI> being pre|&s;ent. Their way of Dealing I knew, and what Security they took, which was impo&s;&s;ible &s;hould run long. And as the Land and Per&s;onal Security is at this day, no living man, although never &s;o knowing in the Laws or in Men, can take a great Ca&s;h into his hands, and pay &s;ix in the hundred for it. Is it not a &s;ad thing, that a <HI>Banker's</HI> Boy &s;hould take up more moneys upon his Notes in one day,
<PB N="21" REF="21">than two Lords, four Knights, and eight E&s;quires in twelves months upon all their Per&s;onal Securities? Unle&s;s we are cutting off our Legs and Arms to &s;ee who will feed the Trunk. We cannot expect this from any of our Neighbours abroad, who&s;e intere&s;t depends upon our lo&s;s. Were it not much better that tho&s;e Lords, Knights, and E&s;quires that now pay eight, nine, and ten pounds in the Hundred for their moneys, and are contented to &s;ell their Lands at &s;ixteen years Purcha&s;e, after Law-&s;uits and troubles attending the Law have de&s;troyed the one half, &s;hould bring up their Lands to thirty years Pur|cha&s;e, and Moneys down to three and a half in the Hun|dred, and redeem the old Credit paid by the People to them?</P>
<P>And I mu&s;t here beg the Gentlemens pardon that wear the Gold Chains in the City of <HI>London,</HI> if I Petition them to take into their Care the true intere&s;t of that Ancient Noble City, which is by u&s;ing &s;uch means as may bring it under a voluntary Regi&s;ter, where a <HI>Bank</HI> will &s;udden|ly ri&s;e, and &s;uch a <HI>Bank</HI> as will be for the benefit and ad|vantage of the whole Kingdom, and Trade Univer&s;al.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e all the hou&s;es in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet</HI> be put into a Regi&s;ter, the title thereby &s;afe and &s;ecure, let them be the Credit, Anchorage, Fund and Foundation to build your <HI>Bank</HI> upon. Then admit the hou&s;es in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet</HI> are worth ten thou&s;and pounds a year, and valued at twenty years purcha&s;e, which they will go at, and much more; Then the <HI>Bank</HI> credit that is to &s;ecure the Lender will be 200 thou&s;and pounds. I &s;ay this being lyable to make good all Moneys the <HI>Bankers</HI> &s;hall receive and take up, then there is no fear but the Lender will have his ends an&s;wered and his Moneys well &s;ecured. And it is certain &s;uch an Anchorage, Fund and Foun|dation
<PB N="22" REF="22">being once laid, will mount that <HI>Bank</HI> within Two Months to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, (and higher it ought not to go.) Then out comes the Moneys unimployed from all per&s;ons in or near <HI>London;</HI> Even Servants, Men and Maids, will tumble in their Moneys as fa&s;t at one end of the <HI>Bank</HI> as it can be told out; And at the other end it is tumbled out again into Trade to Mer|chants and &s;uch as &s;tand in need of ready Moneys, and thereby Trade is made ea&s;ie and much convenienced. And then it will be true with us what Sr. <HI>William Temple</HI> &s;aith of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in his Book of his Ob&s;ervations of the <HI>Nether-lands,</HI> That when the <HI>Bankers</HI> there &s;end to the people that have lent them Moneys to come and fetch their principal and intere&s;t, then, &s;aith he, <HI>they come with Tears in their Eyes de&s;iring them to continue it.</HI> But in <HI>England</HI> many times Men may cry out their Eyes before they get either principal or intere&s;t. What a comfort would this be to Widdows and Orphans, and all &s;uch as know not how, or dare not &s;et out their Moneys at in|tere&s;t, their Moneys now lying dead on their hands, if this were done? And by this <HI>Bank,</HI> and it's Credit will &s;pring up a Lumber-hou&s;e, nay many in the City of <HI>London</HI> to force Trade, to give to people one Commodity for the other, the things now offer'd at by many Gentle|men at <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> hou&s;e. But they having no Fund, Ancho|rage and &s;ecure Foundation, it can come to nothing; the&s;e Lumber-hou&s;es grow out of the &s;ides of the grand <HI>Banks,</HI> which are in all parts and ever &s;hall be the Anchor and Cable of all &s;maller <HI>Banks.</HI> If it &s;hall plea&s;e God once to rai&s;e a Bank in <HI>London</HI> of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds Fund and Anchorage, out of &s;uch a <HI>Bank</HI> will &s;prout out many Lumber hou&s;es and &s;maller <HI>Banks,</HI> to quicken Trade. And certainly then the Moneys will be lent at
<PB N="23" REF="22">four in the hundred, and ready Moneys at all times upon unperi&s;hable Commodities, even to three parts of four of the Value, as doth the King of <HI>Swetheland</HI> with his Iron and Copper at <HI>Hamburgh.</HI> I could write a whole Vo|lume of the advantage it would be to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trades, the growth and manufactures of our own Kingdom: But you &s;hall have a touch or two. When I &s;peak of putting all the poor of <HI>England</HI> at work with the growth of our own Country (here to be manufactured) I do know four per&s;ons in <HI>England,</HI> the Father and three Sons, that are in a great Trade, and I believe they Return more moneys in Trade than any two Merchants or Traders in <HI>England,</HI> which have their moneys at five in the Hundred. And I have heard many &s;ay, that they had rather let them have their moneys at four in the Hundred, than any others at &s;ix, becau&s;e it was &s;afe, and they could have it again when they pleas'd. But the Rea&s;on of all this is, the Anchorage is &s;afe, they having a great real and per&s;onal E&s;tate. And thus it will be with any <HI>Bank</HI> that &s;hall be &s;ettled upon a good, &s;ecure, and unperi&s;hable foundation, into which moneys will be tumbled at &s;mall Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Now I have &s;hewed you what the Credit and Advan|tage of a <HI>Bank</HI> well &s;ettled will be of one Street in <HI>Lon|don;</HI> but what will the Credit of a <HI>Bank</HI> be, if once all the new buildings in and near the City of <HI>London,</HI> de|&s;troyed by the late Fire, come under a Regi&s;ter! O you with Gold Chains, I will tell you half the Hou&s;es in the City cannot mi&s;s coming into the publick <HI>Bank,</HI> to build and help to lay a Foundation to that rich, that de&s;irable, that ju&s;t, beneficial and honourable thing: And the other half of the Hou&s;es will be good Security to the Owners to take up moneys upon them, to &s;erve their occa&s;ions, and drive their Trades with ea&s;e. Then the
<PB N="24" REF="23">Hou&s;es will ri&s;e in their Rents, the Trade will return to the City, the Rats and Mice will leave the Hou&s;es (now only inhabited by them) Honour and Hone&s;ty will re|turn. I have met with many that make the&s;e Objections. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Lawyers will be again&s;t it. <HI>Secondly,</HI> All Gentlemen in Debt will be again&s;t it. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> All the Lawyers in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and Gentlemen in the Hou&s;e in Debt will be again&s;t it. And, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> It will undo thou&s;ands of People, for in producing their Writings holes will be pickt in their Titles.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> If the Lawyers E&s;tates will ri&s;e in Pur|cha&s;e from &s;ixteen to thirty years, then certainly his Fa|mily will be better provided for by that way, and I was &s;aying, more ju&s;tly than now practi&s;ed: And if I do not mi&s;take, it will make Trade much more large in the Kingdom than now it is, which makes more for the Law|yers. And let the Lawyers and all others con&s;ider, the Free Lands of <HI>England</HI> are not the one fifth part; and &s;o all that is de&s;ired is but two Feathers out of their Goo&s;e, and there will be &s;ufficient plucking and picking work be&s;ides. And for ten years there will be more Law than ever to clear up Titles, to make them fit to come into this voluntary Regi&s;ter. The benefit of all the&s;e things certainly will be much more to the Lawyers Advantage than what they get by their pre&s;ent practice. As to the <HI>Second,</HI> "The Gentlemen in debt will be again&s;t it; I &s;ay no they will not, for it will pay their debts without Mo|neys, and that is their Intere&s;t, the undeniable truth of that you have at large in this di&s;cour&s;e. As to the <HI>Third,</HI> you &s;ay, <Q>The Lawyers and Gentlemen in the hou&s;e of <HI>Commons</HI> in debt will be again&s;t it.</Q> My an&s;wer to that is, That two worthy Members of the hou&s;e of Commons who&s;e e&s;tates are encumbred, &s;ay, they are wholly convin|ced
<PB N="25" REF="23">of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity and the advantage of a Re|gi&s;ter, and will carry the Bill into the Hou&s;e when a fit opportunity offers it &s;elf. And I que&s;tion not, but before that time all the People of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e poor Cities and Towns that depend upon Trade, and want Credit and Stock, will di&s;cour&s;e their Parliament Men in the&s;e things hinted at, who thereby will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a Regi&s;ter. As to the <HI>Fourth</HI> Objection, and indeed it was a &s;tring that the Lawyers held hard at, <Q>That it would undo thou&s;ands of Families, becau&s;e that by pro|ducing their Writings holes would be pickt in their Ti|tles, and Gentlemen would not Let their E&s;tates be di&s;|covered.</Q> I &s;ay here is a Salve to cover all this Sore; that is, the Regi&s;ter is voluntary, not compellable, &s;o he that will Regi&s;ter may, and he that will not may chu&s;e; and there will be Lands Regi&s;tred &s;ufficient to encourage Trade upon a &s;udden. And tho&s;e that will make u&s;e of the Lawyers, and the Charge attending the Law, may pur&s;ue their old way; and I will promi&s;e them the per|&s;ons that have Regi&s;tred will not be angry with them. But I will plainly &s;hew you how the per&s;on Regi&s;tring (who po&s;&s;ibly owes Ten thou&s;and pounds, and hath made three or four Mortgages of a Thou&s;and pounds a year) will pay his Debts without Moneys, and will then &s;ee the Lawyers Objections are only made for their own good, that they may pick &s;ome more Feathers off him.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e the Mayor of <HI>Warwick</HI> having a Thou|&s;and pounds a year owes Ten thou&s;and pounds; he comes and Regi&s;ters his Lands, and when the Law &s;aith, it &s;hall be a good Title, no man having entred a Claim, then the Mayor of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Land is a good Title. By this Credit the Mayor &s;hall have his Land ri&s;e price within &s;ix Months to &s;ix and twenty years Purcha&s;e. The Mayor &s;ells off
<PB N="26" REF="24">&s;o much Land as pays the Ten thou&s;and pounds, and hath as much in value left as he had before, (and his Debts paid,) and hath then freed him&s;elf from all the Charge that attends the Law, and is al&s;o able to provide for his Family, and be an In&s;trument for the good of the pub|lick and place where he lives. Whereas before, having but a Thou&s;and pounds a year, and owing Ten thou&s;and pounds, he was valued worth nothing, his Family neg|lected and not provided for, and all his bu&s;ine&s;s was to fence with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lawyers, to keep off and pro|long the Con&s;umption which his E&s;tate was then lia|ble to.</P>
<P>Then &s;uppo&s;e the Mayor of <HI>Coventry</HI> hath One thou|&s;and pounds a year, and oweth Ten thou&s;and pounds, and hath mortgaged his Lands to four &s;everal per&s;ons, one knowing not of the Mortgage to the other: He ob|&s;erving what the Mayor of <HI>Warwick</HI> hath done, that he hath paid his Ten thou&s;and pounds, and freed him&s;elf from all Incumbrances, (and hath as good an E&s;tate as before,) what do you think he will do? I tell you what he will do, he will go to all per&s;ons he hath mortgaged his Land to, and confe&s;s the truth, and de&s;ire them to come with him, and all Regi&s;ter their Titles, when the Law &s;aith that the&s;e Titles &s;hall be good: Then the Mayor of <HI>Coventry</HI> by virtue of the&s;e Regi&s;tred Lands, doth the &s;ame thing that the Mayor of <HI>Warwick</HI> did before. And I wi&s;h that the Members of Parliament for <HI>Warwick, Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Hereford</HI> Shires, would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider of what is here a&s;&s;erted; and if they are convinc't of the truth hereof, let them pur&s;ue the ends for the obtaining of it, and they will quickly find the benefit thereof.</P>
<P>All <HI>Scotland</HI> is under a Regi&s;ter, and worth twenty four years Purcha&s;e; and on the other &s;ide in the North
<PB N="27" REF="24">of <HI>Ireland,</HI> although but three Hours Sail, is worth but eight years Purcha&s;e; and in <HI>England</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Twede,</HI> it is worth but &s;ixteen years Purcha&s;e; the Regi&s;ter is the Cau&s;e. The Mannor of <HI>Taunton Dean</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire</HI> is under a Regi&s;ter, and there the Land is worth three and twenty years Purcha&s;e, although but a Copy|hold Mannor, and at any time he that hath One hundred pounds a year in the Mannor of <HI>Taunton,</HI> may go to the Ca&s;tle and take up Two thou&s;and pounds upon his Lands, and buy Stuffs with the money, and go to <HI>London</HI> and &s;ell his Stuff, and Return down his moneys, and pay but five in the hundred for his moneys, and di&s;charge his Lands. This is the Cau&s;e of the great Trade and Riches in and about <HI>Taunton Dean,</HI> (O happy <HI>Taunton Dean!</HI>) What Gentleman can do thus with Free-lands? No, it is not worth &s;ixteen years Purcha&s;e all <HI>England</HI> over, one place with another; and if not timely put under a Regi&s;ter, it will come to twelve years Purcha&s;e before long. Now you &s;ee a Regi&s;ter is practicable in <HI>Scotland</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>England;</HI> And if it were &s;o by Act of Parliament in the&s;e particular places I have formerly mentioned in this Trea|ti&s;e&punc; there would be no Complaint for want of People or Trade in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks I hear &s;ome object and &s;ay, Although <HI>Scot|land</HI> be under a Regi&s;ter, yet that is a very poor Coun|try. There are many rea&s;ons to be given wherefore <HI>Scotland</HI> might be very poor; And if it were not under a Regi&s;ter the Land would not be worth eight years pur|cha&s;e; But being under a Regi&s;ter you &s;ee how much it exceeds the Lands in <HI>England</HI> in purcha&s;e. <HI>Scotland</HI> is ruled by a Commi&s;&s;ioner, and there you cannot expect that which you may where the Monarch keeps his Court. For here the Merchants have acce&s;s with &s;peed
<PB N="28" REF="25">and ea&s;e to have their grievances heard and redre&s;&s;ed. But in tributary Kingdoms there ever were and ever will be &s;elf-intere&s;t Parties to keep as much as in them lyes, the Peoples grievances from the Princes knowledge, provided they can thereby feather their own Ne&s;ts. Wit|ne&s;s <HI>Flanders</HI> and the Vice-roys that have been &s;ent by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to govern there. But <HI>Scotland</HI> is not under half the Improvement, or ever will be, as <HI>England</HI> is; For in <HI>England</HI> there are large Rivers, and well &s;cituated for Trade, great Woods, Mynes, good Wooll and large Bea&s;ts. In <HI>Scotland</HI> very little Woods, few Iron Mynes, cour&s;e Wooll, and often great part of the Sheep are &s;tarv|ed. And no Northern Kingdom is or ever will be of any great Riches, or are capable thereof: But &s;uch will as have the&s;e things abounding in them, good Ports, advan|tageous Laws for Trade, good Wooll, and good quan|tities thereof, much and well Wooded, with plenty of Iron, Stone and Pit Coales, with Lands fit to bear Flax, with Mynes of Tin and Lead. <HI>Scotland</HI> is a thin and lean Kingdom, and wanting in the&s;e things. <HI>England</HI> is a fat Kingdom, and hath all the&s;e things in it. Yet the <HI>Lothean</HI> Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> are twenty four years purcha&s;e. At <HI>Edinburgh</HI> there is a Grand Regi&s;ter, and in each County a particular one, and no man can be there de|ceived in a Purcha&s;e unle&s;s it be his own fault. <HI>England</HI> is at &s;ixteen years Purcha&s;e. The rea&s;on is obvious why <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t be &s;o, and why <HI>England</HI> is &s;o. But a vo|luntary Regi&s;ter in <HI>England</HI> will cure all, and put us &s;ix years purcha&s;e above <HI>Scotland.</HI> For as I formerly &s;aid, as our Honour and Hone&s;ty is, &s;o will be our Riches; and Riches bring Trade, and Trade brings &s;trength to an I&s;land. And for want of good Titles let the world judge what a Condition we are coming into.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="25">
<P>I will give you one &s;mall In&s;tance, what the poor decayed Trade and Clothiers of <HI>England</HI> would be able to do in ea&s;ing them&s;elves, and making their Trade com|fortable, if they had but the Authority of the Law to Regi&s;ter all their Hou&s;es and Lands. Take it from the City of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> there I make the Precedent, and as it would be with them, &s;o it would be with all the Towns in <HI>England</HI> who deal in the Wollen and Iron Manufacture. Suppo&s;e the Clothiers in and near <HI>Salisbury</HI> have two thou|&s;and pounds a year in free Lands, and their Lands were by Law fixt under a Regi&s;ter, then the Anchorage and Foun|dation of a Bank will be at lea&s;t fifty thou&s;and pounds; And immediately tumbles into them all the idle Moneys, nay Moneys now under Ground, (and good part of the plate) ten Miles round; The U&s;urer will pray, and the Men and Maid-&s;ervants will beg to take in their Moneys. Immediately one hundred thou&s;and pounds will be brought in, and at four in the hundred. What will this do to the poor Clothiers? Nay what will it do to each Gentleman, and all men near <HI>Salisbury</HI> that have or keep Sheep? I &s;ay the help and pre&s;ent Credit of this great Bank and Ca&s;h will rai&s;e the price of Wooll, and &s;et the Poor at work; Thereby enabling the Tenants to pay their Rents, keep the poor of the Pari&s;h, bring the Clothiers and the City into a Comfortable Condition; but mo&s;t of all it will prevent the Trade departing this Kingdom, which of nece&s;&s;ity it will do, if not timely prevented. For the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wooll carried away with their Beef to <HI>Holland, France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> their making Cloth of cheap Wooll with cheap Victuals, with Moneys at three in the hundred, will out do us, and undo us too if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> prevented. Eight years &s;ince I di&s;covered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Wor&s;e Manu|facture,
<PB N="30" REF="26">and the Rea&s;ons, which he made publique in his fir&s;t Book.</P>
<P>The &s;ame that may be done at <HI>Salisbury</HI> by this way, may be done by all the Towns in <HI>England</HI> that depend up|on any of our own Manufactures. And in this ca&s;e here's nothing de&s;ired, but that Men thus qualified with Lands may employ it by the Authority of the Law to the good of them&s;elves and mankind, and to be ju&s;tly hone&s;t to all.</P>
<P>Now methinks I hear many of <HI>Salisbury</HI> &s;ay, But how may this be done which you &s;ay? I tell you how: de&s;ire your Parliament Man to draw you up a Bill and carry it into the Hou&s;e the next &s;itting. But you will &s;ay, he will not do it. Then get your Bi&s;hop to do it. You will &s;ay, he is no Lawyer. Pray tell him it is ea&s;ier than ma|king the River Navigable. But a Regi&s;ter and the River Navigable together will do rarely well. Well, if the Bi&s;hop will do the one, I will do the other; I will only tumble over a few papers wherein are my Ob&s;ervations when I &s;urveyed the River.</P>

<P>As to the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> let the Regi&s;ter be kept by two Gen|tlemen whom you have experience of for Honour and Hone&s;tie. <HI>Secondly,</HI> let the Regi&s;ter be cho&s;en by the

So he that hath mo&s;t Bowles is the man. And by this way no man knows how to find fault with his pretended Friend, or knows who is his Enemy. And certainly this way would drive out ba&s;e intere&s;ts and prefer men of Hone&s;ty, and Honour.

<P>Reader, by this time I hope I have convinced thee of the nece&s;&s;ity of the Free-lands being put under a voluntary Regi&s;ter; And I will now &s;hew to all men the true Rea|&s;ons of the bad Securities by Land at this day. Until about thirty years pa&s;t the Conveyances and Settlements of Lands were three wayes, viz. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> by a Deed inrolled in <HI>Chancerie,</HI> which creates a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. <HI>Secondly,</HI> a Deed and Fine, which doth the &s;ame. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> by a Deed executed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ith Livery and Sei&s;in upon the Land. Two of the&s;e are upon Record, and the third was an Act which was done publickly, whereby the Country might have notice of the transferring the Land, and then there was po&s;&s;ibility of Titles to be known. But now by the occa&s;ion of the late Warrs, and things relating thereunto, there are three things that give liberty to all men to de|fraud whom they plea&s;e, and it is not in the power of man to prevent it. Fir&s;t the &s;ettlement by Lea&s;e and Relea&s;e, a thing that unhinges the whole Free-hold Lands of <HI>England.</HI> For whereas before the people had the other three ways to &s;ettle their E&s;tates, two of which were upon Record, the third of publick Acts in doing of it, by which the Country might take notice thereof; now this private pocket-&s;ettlement called Lea&s;e and Re|lea&s;e, may be done in any Corner privately, and &s;hall be good again&s;t all per&s;ons. The way is this: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> a Lea&s;e is made for a year of the premi&s;es, which by the practice of the Law gives a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; then in another Deed the Lea&s;e is recited, and a Deed of Relea&s;e made, both which Convey the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ee. This may be done in <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="29">and the Lea&s;e left in the hands of the per&s;on whom it was made to; and the Grantor brings away the Re|lea&s;e with him. The year is expired, then the Lands are &s;old, and a Bill in <HI>Chancery</HI> is preferr'd, and the partie &s;wears no Incumbrance, and gets a great &s;um of Mo|neys; then delivers the Relea&s;e to the party that had the Lea&s;e for the year. Then the Title is ve&s;ted in the Lea&s;e and Relea&s;e. Then he comes and Ejects him that bought for valuable Con&s;ideration, becau&s;e he had the proper Title. I could name &s;ix per&s;ons that were &s;erved &s;o, and one of them not under the degree of a Sergeant at Law. And pray now what Lawyer knows a Title? The <HI>Se|cond</HI> &s;ort are the private Settlements made to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;ons be|fore or in the War; they were done by the Royali&s;ts to pre&s;erve them again&s;t the Parliament party; the like did the Parliament party do to pre&s;erve them again&s;t the Kings party; the like doth the Romani&s;t at this day. I have been a Commi&s;&s;ioner in many of the&s;e Titles, and they are &s;till kept on Foot to play fa&s;t or loo&s;e as they plea&s;e; &s;ome of which are every Term heard of in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> Hall. The <HI>Third</HI> are Bonds given to the King, although made in an Ale-hou&s;e or Tavern, and never Re|corded in the Exchequer, nor in any Court el&s;e; yet the&s;e Bonds are a Judgment in Law, and by virtue there|of will be fir&s;t &s;erved, (and before all men el&s;e.) And at this day many Gentlemen (and others that I know) have &s;old Land &s;ince they entred into the&s;e Bonds, and the Bonds not &s;atisfied. I &s;peak this with honour to the King's Prerogative, and affirm that it would be more for his Maje&s;ty's advantage al&s;o, if E&s;tates were Regi&s;tred, for he would then &s;ee what Security he has for his Money, whereas his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf is many times a lo&s;er, by tru&s;ting upon in&s;ufficient Security. And it is now a
<PB N="37" REF="29">common practice to convey away all Lands before a man becomes bound to the King.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e Uncertainties of Titles of Land, it is brought &s;o to pa&s;s at this day, that whatever Moneys is or hath been borrowed, by Companies Incorporated, or upon the Credit, or under the Common Seal of Cities or Corporations, none can be recovered by Law. I hope now no Gentleman of the Long Robe can pretend to know a good Title from a bad, and therefore will be now willing to let the Free-lands of <HI>England</HI> to be put under a voluntary Regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>But I hear &s;ome &s;ay, That for all that hath been &s;aid in this Di&s;cour&s;e they are not &s;atisfied, the <HI>Dutch</HI> will be beat without fighting. Well then, I will give you &s;ome more &s;atisfaction. I pray ob&s;erve what the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> have been doing for this many years; it has been courting and fighting for this Mi&s;tre&s;s called Trade. And ob&s;erve how the <HI>Dutch</HI> have fitted her with all that &s;he can de&s;ire; as with a Regi&s;ter of Lands, Banks, Lumber|hou&s;e, cut Rivers, ea&s;ie Ports in point of Cu&s;toms, a Court of Merchants: And the&s;e give her delights, and &s;he hath no mind to depart from them. And her long continuance hath made her Lovers va&s;tly rich, and the Towns where &s;he maketh her abode, both populous and great. And though in the Three Maritime Provinces they have neither good Water nor good Air, yet are their Lands at fifty years Purcha&s;e. Now ob&s;erve, <HI>Eng|land</HI> lyes within twenty Hours &s;ail of <HI>Holland,</HI> and is &s;tored with many and much better Ports than <HI>Holland</HI> hath: And our Ships by rea&s;on of the deepne&s;s of our Rivers, can go out and come in with much greater Bur|dens than theirs can, and we lye as well to the <HI>Baltick</HI> as they, and much better to the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> Ea&s;t and
<PB N="38" REF="30">We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> than they do. And in <HI>England</HI> are Noble Seats to be purcha&s;ed, and a good Air. Now Reader, do&s;t thou think, that the great <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants and others rich in Ca&s;h, would &s;tay there, if we had here publick Security for our Lands, that they might purcha&s;e &s;afely here? I &s;ay they would come over in Swarms, and would willingly give thirty years purcha&s;e for Lands here. So that the great Merchants coming from thence, and buying E&s;tates here, will bring away the great Riches from thence, and &s;o increa&s;e Trade here; and thereby the <HI>Dutch</HI> will decline gradually every year more and more, and within very few years their beloved Mi|&s;tre&s;s will depart, and will come and &s;ettle her &s;elf with us. And as we are an I&s;land which God and Nature hath fitted for Trade, if we once fit our &s;elves with Laws an|&s;werable, then the greate&s;t part of the Trade of <HI>Europe</HI> will be with us. And if this doth not convince the Rea|der, that hereby we &s;hall beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> without fighting, and pay our Debts without Moneys, I have no more to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the Advantages afore&s;aid, let me tell you that I have found out two places, one in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the other in <HI>England:</HI> In that in <HI>Ireland</HI> are great and &s;trange quan|tities of Timber to build Ships, and places to build them, and at three fifths of the Rates the King now builds at, with convenient places to lay up the Ships, and thereby to be ready upon all occa&s;ions. That in <HI>England</HI> is con|venient to build Ships at, and at very ea&s;ie Rates, and is as good a Harbour to lay them up in as any is in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and in the very Eye of <HI>France.</HI> And I de&s;ire it may be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered. And that the truth may be demon&s;trated of what I &s;ay, I have affixed two &s;heets in Maps to this Book, whereby the truth a&s;&s;erted may be made the more clear.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="30">
<P>About two years &s;ince, I was prevailed upon by &s;ome of the Money Bankers, and &s;ome Gentlemen to go over in|to <HI>Ireland</HI> to Survey &s;ome Iron works, Woods and Lands which they were in propo&s;ition for, with Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> being Works, Lands, and Woods lying near the River <HI>Slane</HI> in the Counties of <HI>Wexford</HI> and <HI>Wicklow,</HI> and formerly &s;et on Foot by Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Heath,</HI> Mr. <HI>Abbot</HI> the Scrivener, Docter <HI>Yates</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Timothy Stamp,</HI> and from them Conveyed to Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> to advance a &s;um of Moneys, and to manage the Works and to give an Accompt: But the Parties differ|ing, and &s;ome bad Titles made with &s;uits at Law had &s;o unhinged and deba&s;ed the whole affair, that nothing po&s;&s;ibly could be done, unle&s;s we could come upon &s;ome new Foundation. So my &s;elf and &s;ervants &s;pent &s;ome time in Surveying the Woods, Lands and Works, in which I did evidently perceive the De&s;ign at the fir&s;t was very rationally laid, but unfortunately de&s;troyed. I then con&s;idered what might be done. After I had &s;urveyed the River <HI>Slane,</HI> and the Brooks and Rivulets running in|to the &s;ame, and the Woods adjoyning unto them, with that noble great and good Wood called <HI>Shelela,</HI> I then did perfectly &s;ee what a great &s;hame it was that &s;uch quantities of Timber &s;hould ly rotting in the&s;e Woods, and could not be come at, the Mountains and Boggs having &s;o lockt them up, that they could not be brought to any Sea-port to be imployed in building of Ships. But my &s;elf and tho&s;e I employed having &s;pent much time in the &s;urveying the &s;aid River <HI>Slane</HI> and the Rivu|lets running into it, we found that they may be made &s;o Navigable for Ten thou&s;and pounds, as all tho&s;e Woods may with ea&s;e and at very cheap Rates be brought down
<PB N="40" REF="31">the <HI>Slane</HI> to <HI>Wexford,</HI> and to other places near thereunto, to build Men of War and other Ships. And I know in the Woods near unto the <HI>Slane,</HI> that may come down that River, (if once Navigable) there is Timber &s;uffici|ent to make a hundred Men of War (and &s;ome hundreds of Bu&s;&s;es) and as good Timber as any is in <HI>England,</HI> (I was going to &s;ay better) and not one &s;tick wanting that Oak is capable of doing: And the fir&s;t lengths of Ma&s;ts al&s;o, (and they will &s;erve well for that u&s;e.) And as now the&s;e Woods are (and as they will for ever be, unle&s;s by &s;ome &s;uch way relieved) they will never bring the Own|ers Twenty thou&s;and pounds, (nor Ten I verily believe.) But if the <HI>Slane</HI> were made Navigable and the Rivulets running into it, the&s;e great quantities of Timber might be employed in building Ships for the Royal Navy, and may if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;e, be kept either in an Admiralty at <HI>Wexford,</HI> or in &s;ome Port near, or in <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, and there they will be ready to &s;ail upon any occa&s;ion, ei|ther to pre&s;erve the We&s;t <HI>India</HI> Trade, or into the <HI>Medi|terranean,</HI> and thereby give great comfort to all Trade that is u&s;ed in tho&s;e Seas; as al&s;o incourage the People, and drive away their pre&s;ent fears. And I am very well &s;atisfied that Ships of all Rates will be built at <HI>Wexford</HI> or thereabouts at three fifths of what the King now pays for building; and there they may be al&s;o Gun'd and Victu|alled. The Woods are the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;eys,</HI> the Lord <HI>Baltimores,</HI> Sir <HI>Laurence E&s;monds,</HI> the Lord <HI>Arons,</HI> and <HI>Shelela</HI> the Earl of <HI>Straffords,</HI> with many other &s;mall Woods. Here you have the Map of the River and Ri|vulets, with &s;ome &s;mall Signs of the Woods before men|tioned.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="33">&s;ince I was taken down by the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> to <HI>Salis|bury</HI> to Survey the River of <HI>Avon,</HI> to find whether that River might be made Navigable: As al&s;o whether a &s;afe Harbour could be made at <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> for Ships to come in and out, and lye &s;afe. After I had &s;urveyed the Ri|ver, I found it might with ea&s;e be made Navigable. I then with &s;everal others went to Sea &s;everal times, to &s;ound and find the depths, and to di&s;cover what the An|chorage was. At la&s;t I found in the Sea great quantities of Iron Stones lye in a Ridge. For in the Sea, pointing directly upon the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> ob&s;erving it at low Wa|ter, I found that Ridge of Iron Stones was the cau&s;e that forc't the ground Tide about the point, which had carri|ed and lodged the Sands &s;o, as it had choaked up the Harbour: But the Stones near the Shore lay &s;o great and thick, that they were the occa&s;ion of lodging the Sands by them, near the We&s;tern Shore, and &s;o of pre&s;erving a place which is very deep and good Anchorage, and within one hundred Yards of the Shore, which gives un|to that River the advantage of making there as good an Harbour, as to the depth of Water it will draw, as any is in <HI>England,</HI> where a Boy and a Cord two Inches Dia|meter will be &s;ufficient to hold a Ship; the Harbour be|ing a great Inland Lake or Pool, and well defended from all Winds. When my &s;elf and &s;ome were well &s;atisfied of the conveniency of the place for a Harbour, I waited upon the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> and &s;ome other Gentlemen to Sea, and there did di&s;cover to them the Rea&s;ons at large, having convinc't them upon the place, of the fitne&s;s and conveniency in making a Harbour there. They then pro|ceeded to do &s;omething in Treating about the River: At which time I ob&s;erved two great things that place was capable of. The Fir&s;t is, At that very place where the
<PB N="42" REF="34">Harbour may be made, there may at any time &s;afely come in and quietly ride at lea&s;t 50 or 60 fifth and &s;ixth Rate Frigats; and that which is more &s;trange, within three hundred yards of the place there is a Hill or Promontory, which was an old Camp of the <HI>Romans</HI> or <HI>Saxons,</HI> as it is &s;aid, which will lodge a hundred thou&s;and men, and in three days may be made &s;o defen&s;ible, that no Army (be it never &s;o great) will be able to annoy them, all parts of the &s;aid Camp being defended by Sea except about three hundred yards, and that is intrenched by a very va&s;t Ditch, yet very u&s;eful; and Relief by Sea may be brought to this place every Tide, and no Party by Land, as it is now, can give any oppo&s;ition. And to me it is very &s;trange, that notice long &s;ince had not been taken of it, and &s;ome Forts built there. The Second thing I there took notice of, was, The great Advantage his Ma|je&s;ty might make of that place when the Habour was opened, for the building of fifth and &s;ixth Rate Frigats. A place none can be better, with the&s;e Advantages. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Within the Harbour is a convenient place to build Ships. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Timber will be carried down <HI>Avon</HI> to the place for building, for four Shillings the Tun or Load; the Timber coming out of <HI>New-Fore&s;t,</HI> the River running by the Fore&s;t &s;ide, and at pre&s;ent His Maje&s;ty &s;ends the Timber out of the Fore&s;t to <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> to build, and pays for a Load to <HI>Redbridge</HI> fourteen &s;hillings, and from <HI>Redbridge</HI> to <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> by Water eight &s;hillings the Load. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> This place is and may be made by Art, with the laying out of two thou&s;and pounds upon a Fort, a full defence again&s;t any Enemy landing, and &s;ecure all his Maje&s;ties Ships that &s;hall be laid in there from the at|tempts of any Enemy what&s;oever, and will there be fit and ready almo&s;t with any Wind to &s;ail out. It lyes over

<PB N="43" REF="36">again&s;t the very heart of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;uch Ships may there go to Sea and be about their work, when others cannot come about, for contrary Winds.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> great advantage is, that there the King may have all his Iron made, and Guns ca&s;t at very cheap Rates. There is the Iron Stone in the Sea, by the Har|bour mouth, and the King hath va&s;t quantities of Woods decayed in <HI>New Fore&s;t;</HI> of which at this time Charcoal is made, and Shipt away to <HI>Cornwall</HI> and other parts. If two Furnaces be built about <HI>Ringwood</HI> to ca&s;t Guns, and two Forges to make Iron, and the Iron Stone be brought from the Harbour mouth out of the Sea up the River to the Furnaces, and the Charcole out of <HI>New Fore&s;t</HI> to the works, there being &s;ufficient of decayed Woods to &s;upply four Iron-works for ever; by the&s;e means the King makes the be&s;t of every thing, and builds with his own Timber being near and convenient; whereas now the charge and carriage makes the Timber 07 of no u&s;e to him. And having Iron Stone of his own for gathering up, and Wood of his own for nothing, he will have very cheap Guns and Iron. And all the&s;e things &s;et together, this is a bu&s;ine&s;s befitting a King to have. And as I &s;aid, this Fort will be made, and an&s;wer the ends I here lay down, for two thou&s;and pounds, and the Iron works built and Docks to build three Ships at one time for eight thou&s;and pounds. The di&s;covery more particular of the place of the deep Water and Fort to be made, and the Harbour within, with a de&s;cription of the Camp adjoyning is here in the Map affixed.</P>
<P>Now Reader, I hope I have made good my promi&s;e of di&s;covering two places convenient to build Ships in, and at ea&s;ie Rates, and al&s;o to lay them up &s;afe, and in places that are eminently convenienced for quick getting out and
<PB N="44" REF="37">could &s;ay much more of the&s;e two places as to publick be|nefit, but it may be, and it is not to be que&s;tioned, I &s;hall meet with Enemies for &s;aying &s;o much, for I know now almo&s;t all men are Sacrificing all things to their own Nets and Drags, or to &s;uch Great ones as they lye under. However if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;e to Command me, I will go to <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> with any knowing per&s;on, and there up|on the place &s;hew him all that is here affirmed, (and the Rea&s;ons:) the like I will do as to the <HI>Slane</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Woods I &s;o commend, joyning thereunto; and upon the place demon&s;trate and make out how the River <HI>Slane</HI> and Rivulets running into the &s;ame, may be made Navi|gable; and &s;hew the great quantities of Timber that may thereby be brought down to build Men of War, the places convenient for building them, and that no King or Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> hath &s;uch an advantage to build Ships as the King of <HI>England</HI> may have with that Timber in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>The Way to employ and &s;et at Work all the Poor of</HI> England, <HI>both Man, Woman, and Child, that are capable and able to work, and all to be done by improving two of our own Manufactures (the growth whereof is all of our own I&s;land;) the one the Linen, the other the Iron Manu|facture.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS to Linen Cloth of all &s;orts, what va&s;t quantities are yearly brought into <HI>England,</HI> and here made u&s;e of, and by us &s;ent unto our I&s;lands, and to many other places, the making of which &s;ets at work abun|dance of People in other Nations; as al&s;o Threads, Tapes, Twine for Cordage, and wrought Flax? Now who
<PB N="45" REF="37">makes the fine Linen Clothes, and where have they the Materials? I &s;ay the fine Linens are made in <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> that is, woven and whitened there, but the Thread that makes them comes out of <HI>Germany</HI> from <HI>Saxony, Bohemia,</HI> and other parts thereabouts, and is brought down the <HI>Elbe</HI> and <HI>Rhine</HI> in dry Fats for <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders;</HI> and there the Merchants have at this day, and &s;o will ever have, a va&s;t Trade in the&s;e Commodities, un|le&s;s that Trade of Linen be advanced in <HI>England,</HI> and in|couraged as I &s;hall &s;et down. But, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Ob&s;erve that the People of <HI>Holland</HI> eat dear and pay great Rents for their Hou&s;es, and &s;o they do in <HI>Flanders;</HI> but the weav|ing and whitening of the Cloth is not above the tenth part of the labour. For the great labour is in preparing the Flax, as pulling, watering, dre&s;&s;ing, &s;pinning, and winding, and all this is done in the upper parts of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> and thereabouts; there Victuals are cheap, and in all the&s;e parts there is no Beggar, nor no occa&s;ion to beg; and in all Towns there are Schools for little Girls, from &s;ix years old and upwards, to teach them to &s;pin, and &s;o to bring their tender Fingers by degrees to &s;pin ve|ry fine, which being young are thereby ea&s;ily fitted for that u&s;e. Whereas People overgrown in age cannot &s;o well feel the Thread. Their Wheels go all by the foot, made to go with much ea&s;e, whereby the action or moti|on is very ea&s;ie and delightful. And in all Towns there are Schools according to the bigne&s;s, or multitude of the poor Children. I will here &s;hew you the way, method, rule, and order how they are Governed.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There is a large Room, and in the middle there|of a little Box like a Pulpit. <HI>Secondly,</HI> There are Benches built round about the Room as they are in our Play|hou&s;es; upon the Benches &s;it about two hundred Chil|dren
<PB N="46" REF="38">&s;pinning, and in the Box in the middle of the Room &s;its the Grand Mi&s;tre&s;s with a long white Wand in her hand. If &s;he ob&s;erves any of them idle, &s;he reaches them a tap; but if that will not do, &s;he rings a Bell which by a little Cord is fixt to the Box, and out comes a Woman; &s;he then points to the Offender, and &s;he is taken away into another Room and cha&s;ti&s;ed. And all this is done without one word &s;peaking. And I believe this way of ordering the young Women in <HI>Germany</HI> is one great cau&s;e that the <HI>German</HI> Women have &s;o little of the twit twat. And I am &s;ure it would be well were it &s;o in <HI>England.</HI> And it is clear, that the le&s;s there is of &s;peaking, the more there may be of working. In a lit|tle Room by the School there is a Woman that is prepa|ring and putting Flax on the Di&s;taffs, and upon the ring|ing of the Bell, and pointing the Rod at the Maid that hath &s;pun off her Flax, &s;he hath another Di&s;taff given her, and her Spool of Thread taken from her, and put into a Box unto others of the &s;ame &s;ize to make Cloth.</P>
<P>And ob&s;erve what Advantages they make of &s;uiting their Threads to make Cloth, all being of equal Threads. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They rai&s;e their Children as they &s;pin finer to the higher Benches. <HI>Secondly,</HI> They &s;ort and &s;ize all the Threads &s;o, that they can apply them to make equal Cloaths. Whereas here in <HI>England</HI> one Woman, or good Hou&s;ewife, hath it may be &s;ix or eight Spinners be|longing to her, and at &s;ome odd times &s;he &s;pins, and al&s;o her Children and Servants, and all this Thread &s;hall go together, &s;ome for Woof, &s;ome for Warp, to make a piece of Cloth. And as the Linen is Manufactured in <HI>England</HI> at this day, it cannot be otherwi&s;e. And is it not a pity and &s;hame, that the young Children and Maids here in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be idle within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word">, begging ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d,
<PB N="47" REF="39">tearing Hedges, or robbing Orchards, and wor&s;e, when the&s;e, and the&s;e alone, are the people that may, and mu&s;t if ever, &s;et up this Trade of making fine Linen here? And after a young Maid hath been three years in the &s;pinning School, that is taken in at &s;ix and then continues until nine years, &s;he will get eight pence the day. And in the&s;e parts I &s;peak of, a man that has mo&s;t Children lives be&s;t; whereas here he that has mo&s;t is poore&s;t. There the Children enrich the Father, but here begger him.</P>
<P>Joining to this Spinning-School are three more Schools, ordered as this &s;poken of is. One is for Maids weaving Bone-lace, another for Boys making Toys, &s;ome cutting the Heads, &s;ome the Bodies, &s;ome the Legs; the third is for Boys painting the Toys and &s;lit Pictures.</P>
<P>I know the&s;e Que&s;tions will be put or asked: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Where would you have this Trade &s;ettled in <HI>England? Secondly,</HI> How &s;hall there be Flax provided for to manage this Trade? And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Where &s;hall be Stock at fir&s;t, and where can we have places to whiten? I An&s;wer, <HI>Warwick, Leice&s;ter, Northampton,</HI> and <HI>Oxford</HI> Shires are the places fit to &s;et up this Manufacture, becau&s;e in the&s;e Countries there is at pre&s;ent no Staple Trade, and the Land there for Flax is very good, being rich and dry, wherein Flax doth abundantly delight. And I affirm, that the Flax that grows in the&s;e parts, &s;hall do any thing that the <HI>German</HI> or any other Flax can do, provided it be ordered accordingly. As to the &s;econd and third, (as to Flax and Stock) let each County begin with two thou|&s;and Pounds Stock apiece immediately to provide Hou&s;es as before &s;et down, and employ it as is directed. And for places to Whiten, near all the great Towns there are Brooks or Rivers where bleeching places may be made in
<PB N="48" REF="40">the Lands adjoining, as is in <HI>Southwark</HI> by help of the flowing of the <HI>Thames.</HI> And for Men and Women to Govern the Trade, I know in every Country there are Men &s;ufficient to direct and order it.</P>
<P>I know it will be much inquired into by many, why <HI>Warwick, Leice&s;ter, Northampton,</HI> and <HI>Oxford-&s;hires</HI> &s;hould be the places fixed on for the Linnen Manufacture before all other Counties in <HI>England?</HI> I an&s;wer, there are no Counties in <HI>England</HI> &s;o capable of making the Commo|dity &s;o good and &s;o cheap as the&s;e. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> their Land is excellent good to produce Flax. <HI>Secondly,</HI> they are in|land Counties, and have no &s;taple Manufacture at pre|&s;ent fixt with them; whereby their poor are idle and want imployment. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> they are Counties the be&s;t furni&s;hed at all times with Corn and Fle&s;h of any Coun|ties in <HI>England,</HI> and at cheape&s;t Rates. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> they are in the heart of <HI>England,</HI> and the Trade being once well &s;etled in the&s;e Counties will influence their Neigh|bouring Counties in the &s;ame Manufacture in &s;ending their Flax and threads with ea&s;e and cheapne&s;s down the Rivers <HI>Thames, Avon, Trent,</HI> and St <HI>Eades:</HI> all which Navigable Rivers come into the&s;e Counties. And I af|firm it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;et up this Trade in any other part of <HI>England</HI> with &s;ucce&s;s but in the&s;e places, becau&s;e in mo&s;t part of <HI>England</HI> there are fixt Manufactures al|ready that do in great mea&s;ure &s;et the poor at work. In the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> clothing of all &s;orts, as in <HI>Gloce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, Shrop&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire,</HI> and a &s;mall part of <HI>Warwick&s;hire:</HI> In <HI>Derby, Nottingham</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> the Iron and Wollen Manufacture: In <HI>Suffolk, Norfolk,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Wollen Manufacture: In <HI>Kent, Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Surry,</HI> &s;ome Cloth, Iron, and Materials for Shipping. Then to Counties to rai&s;e provi&s;ions and to vend them
<PB N="49" REF="41">at <HI>London</HI> to feed that great Mouth, are <HI>Cambridge, Hun|tington, Buckingham, Hartford, Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Berks.</HI> And if you rightly weigh and con&s;ider how <HI>England</HI> is fixed in all parts as to the Growth, Trade, Manufacture, and vending thereof, there are no Counties in <HI>England</HI> that this de&s;irable gainful improvement of the Linen Ma|nufacture po&s;&s;ibly can be managed in, with the like &s;uc|ce&s;s, as in the forementioned Counties. For as Common Hone&s;ty is nece&s;&s;ary for Trade, and without it Trade will decay: &s;o any Manufacture fixed in any place where it may be better accommodated, thither it will go, and &s;o remove from the place where it was fir&s;t &s;et up; and the di&s;couragments it received there many times keep it from fixing any where el&s;e. About &s;even or eight years &s;ince there was a Propo&s;al of &s;etting up the Linen Ma|nufacture in and near <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> a Town of two hundred void hou&s;es, to be had for little, and near the Sea: but I coming to that Town was pre&s;t hard to give my Opini|on, whether the Linen Trade might be there &s;et up with &s;ucce&s;s? After I had rid about the Town as far as <HI>Catta|way</HI> Bridge, and ob&s;erved the Influence that the <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Trade had there; as al&s;o the Stuff and Say Trade, where|by the Poor were comfortably &s;upplyed: I then found it was impo&s;&s;ible to go on with &s;ucce&s;s, and gave my rea&s;ons, upon which all was laid a&s;ide, and my rea&s;ons approved of. I did al&s;o acquaint one of the Grandees of the Linen Trade at <HI>Clarken-well,</HI> that that Trade would eat out its own Bowels, Stock and Block would come to nothing. And &s;o it &s;hall do in the Countries I name, and in all other places in the World, being a new Manufacture, unle&s;s the Publick Authority take care and cheri&s;h it, for at lea&s;t &s;even years. The way how, I will &s;et down when I have fini&s;hed my Di&s;cour&s;e of this and
<PB N="50" REF="42">the Iron Manufacture; for it is as fit to be done for the incouragement of the Iron Manufacture, as for the Li|nen Manufacture. And ob&s;erve, I pray you, the&s;e Coun|ties I now name for the Linen Manufacture, employ more hands at work by their growth, than any eight Counties of <HI>England</HI> do by the growth of theirs, and all employed abroad in other Counties, not in their own. And the great cau&s;e of Strength and Riches to <HI>England</HI> are tho&s;e great quantities of Wool which grow in their great Pa&s;tures, and are &s;ent abroad into the We&s;t and other parts, and there Manufactured, where they keep at work infinite quantities of poor people, as Spin|ners, Carders, Weavers, Dre&s;&s;ers, Dyers. Yet I have &s;een two pieces in Print, each making great complaint, that by the late Inclo&s;ures in the&s;e Counties, a Dog and a Boy do manage as much Lands as formerly employed ten Teams, and kept forty per&s;ons at work all the year. Never con&s;idering that the Land inclo&s;ed is treble the benefit to the Owner (after the Mini&s;ters and Poors part was thrown out) over what it was before it was inclo&s;ed; and that the product of the Wool proceeding from the &s;ame Land, does &s;et at work five times the number of people in other places of the Kingdom. And &s;o it will be with the Linen Manufactures, if once well &s;ettled in the&s;e four Counties, and incouraged by a Publick Law. Then the&s;e Counties will be as <HI>Germany</HI> is to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders:</HI> There the Flax will grow, and be Manufactu|red ea&s;ily and cheap; part whitened there, and the Thread and part of the Flax &s;ent down the Navigable Rivers to the &s;everal Towns to be woven and &s;pun. And &s;o there will be employ for the greate&s;t part of the Poor of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> And in &s;uch Towns where it meets with a &s;ettled vo|luntary Regi&s;ter, thence never will it depart.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="42">
<P>But I mu&s;t now name you &s;ome Lands in the&s;e Coun|ties very fit for Flax, thereby to make you know the fit|ne&s;s of the re&s;t, with its quantities; as al&s;o &s;how you the quantities of Flax that may grow upon one Mannor in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> and the number of poor people it will em|ploy: by which Demon&s;trations you may judge what may be done in the four Counties named in this De&s;ign offered at.</P>
<P>For this twelve years la&s;t pa&s;t, I having my <HI>London</HI> Road through <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> made my Ob&s;ervations of the Land there, and the fitne&s;s of it to bear Flax; but more particularly of the Mannor of <HI>Milcott,</HI> being the Earl of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI>'s near <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon.</HI> Which Mannor is about three thou&s;and Acres, and to the value of three thou&s;and pounds a year, as I am informed. The Land in this Mannor is &s;ound, rich, dry, and good, and that is the true Land to bear Flax. And in this Mannor &s;ome years there are &s;own &s;ome hundred Acres of Flax: But if the whole Mannor were &s;own with Flax, it would employ nine thou&s;and people in the Manufacturing there|of, as to &s;owing, weeding, pulling, watering, dre&s;&s;ing, &s;pinning, winding, weaving, and whitening. One part of which labour would be done upon and near the place; the other would be done in remote parts, the Flax and Thread being carried down the River <HI>Avon</HI> into <HI>Severne,</HI> and &s;o conveyed with ea&s;e to <HI>Bri&s;tol, Wales,</HI> and other parts, to &s;et the Poor at work, which want employment; and &s;o the &s;mall Towns will &s;et their Poor at work by the &s;ame Rule as they do in <HI>Germany,</HI> and then there will need no Relief from the Pari&s;h for the Poor, nor will there be any complaining in the Streets. One Acre of Land will bear three hundred weight of Flax. This three hundred weight of Flax well dre&s;t and made fine, will
<PB N="52" REF="43">make four hundred Ells of Cloth, worth three &s;hillings the Ell, which will be in value when it is manufactured three&s;core Pounds. You mu&s;t ob&s;erve, the finer the Thread is, the le&s;s Flax goeth to make it, and the more Cloth it will make. And &s;o there being the labour of three per&s;ons to manufacture the Flax that comes of this one Acre of Land, this Mannor will employ nine thou|&s;and per&s;ons. Now there are at lea&s;t Ten thou&s;and Acres of Land be&s;ides this, very good for Flax in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> and no le&s;s quantity in any of the three other Counties, every way as good. Now, Reader, I pray An&s;wer me, whether here be not work &s;ufficient upon the growth and product of our own Land, nay in four Counties where no Manufacture is, to &s;et the greate&s;t part of the Poor of <HI>England</HI> at work; be&s;ides the great advantage it will bring to the Owners of the Lands; and the great en|riching of the Country, by fixing &s;o great a &s;taple Trade there, and bringing a multitude of People al&s;o, which is, and ever will be a great enrichment to the place where they are. Witne&s;s the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> by the Woollen Ma|nufactures; and <HI>Buringham, Sturbridge, Dudly, Wa&s;&s;al,</HI> and thereabout, for the Iron Manufactures. And I dare af|firm, take <HI>Dudly</HI> to be the Center of ten Miles round, con&s;idering the badne&s;s of the Land, it is there twice as dear as it is in the four Counties here named. And with|in ten Miles round <HI>Dudly,</HI> there are more people inhabit|ing and more Money returned in a year, than is in the&s;e four rich fat Counties I mention. And by this Manu|facture we &s;hould prevent at lea&s;t two Millions of Money a year from being &s;ent out of the Land for Linen Cloth, and keep our people at home who now go beyond the Seas for want of imployment here. For where ever the Country is full of people, they are rich; and where
<PB N="53" REF="43">thin, there the place is poor, and all Commodities cheap.</P>
<P>I could put &s;omething further into the Heads of the Gentlemen of the&s;e Counties, wherein they may have much more added to this pre&s;cribed Linen Trade: but then I fear their Neighbouring Gentlemen will fall at Difference, why one &s;hould have &s;o much benefit and the other &s;o little, as they did when I &s;urveyed <HI>Trent</HI> for them in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty five, and a Tax &s;hall be laid upon the Stock &s;ettled, as they did upon mine and Partners, as &s;oon as I had made the Ri|ver <HI>Avon</HI> Navigable, and brought Barges to <HI>Strat|ford.</HI></P>
<P>I know many will &s;ay, This is a very good way to im|ploy the poor, but what &s;hall they do for Looms, Slayes, and Wheels for to &s;pin and weave this Flax, and how &s;hall we make our Flax fine, &s;o that we may make fine Cloth, and what &s;hall we do for places to whiten it at, for it is &s;aid that no place will do it well but at <HI>Haerlem</HI> in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and that is becau&s;e of the water in the Mere join|ing unto the Town.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, thou maye&s;t have the Looms, Wheels, and Slayes at fir&s;t out of <HI>Germany</HI> and from <HI>Haerlem:</HI> Two Looms, Two Wheels, and ten Slayes will be &s;uffi|cient to make others by; and all the&s;e thou maye&s;t have for twenty pounds. As to the Second, there is much in preparing and fitting of the Flax, &s;o as to make it run to a fine Thread. This is the way they do it in <HI>Germany,</HI> and thou maye&s;t write by their Copy. Thou mu&s;t twice a year beat thy Flax well and dre&s;s it well, and take out of it all the filth, and &s;o for as long as thou ha&s;t it in thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if it be ten years; and the longer thou keepe&s;t it, the finer it will be, for beating and often dre&s;&s;ing will
<PB N="54" REF="44">cau&s;e the Harle to open, and at la&s;t it will be &s;trangely fine. There mu&s;t al&s;o be a Stove in the Room where the Flax is, with Fire in it in all moi&s;t times, which keeps the Flax dry and prevents Moi&s;tne&s;s, which is a|nother great cau&s;e which makes it &s;o fine. I have &s;een Flax in <HI>Saxony</HI> twenty years old thus hou&s;-wife't, which was as fine as the hairs of ones head. It is true there what the old &s;aying is here, That Wooll may be kept to Dirt, and Flax to Silk.</P>
<P>And as to the Second, It is true that their Hollands and Clothes are whitened at <HI>Haerlem,</HI> and by the very &s;ides of the Lake, and Cuts are conveniently made, and the Lake is much of a height at all times, and &s;o it feeds the Cuts with water, that with ea&s;e they may Sprinkle the Clothes as there is Occa&s;ion; al&s;o it is well fitted with Hou&s;es by the &s;ides of the Cuts to boyl the Yarn, and prepare it the &s;ooner to be white. The&s;e are good things, and by the &s;ituation of the Place and conveniency of the Mere it doth much advance the bu&s;ine&s;s. Rich Mer|chants are there &s;eated, that drive great Trades, and there they have a Bank, and their Moneys at three in the Hundred. But as to <HI>Haerlem</HI> Lake, it is &s;ubject to be mixed with Salt-water, which is brought in the Ships daily from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and there pumpt out into the Lake. And all that can be &s;aid for that Water being bet|ter than any other Water in <HI>Holland</HI> is this, that it conti|nually &s;tands in a Pool or Lake, and by the influence and heat of the Sun is made &s;oft, and &s;o very fit for &s;couring, and the like is not in any part of <HI>Holland</HI> el&s;e. But in <HI>England</HI> we have many places very fit, and by Nature convenient, and with a little Art, as good as <HI>Haerlem,</HI> if not better. And for In&s;tance take two places, one at
<PB N="55" REF="44"><HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> the other at <HI>Coventry.</HI> At <HI>Strat|ford</HI> upon <HI>Avon</HI> near the Bridge in the Lands of Sir <HI>John Clapton,</HI> by virtue of the Mills pounding high, or at a ri&s;e of Water, he may lead the Water along his own Land, until it come &s;o high that no Flood will reach. There Cuts may be made in his Land, and Hou&s;es built with &s;pare pieces to bleech the Cloth on, the Water be|ing taken into the Cuts about the end of <HI>March,</HI> and &s;o continued therein, whereby the heat of the Sun will more and more &s;often and fit it for bleeching. The &s;econd place is <HI>Coventry;</HI> Almo&s;t round the City the Lands and Waters lye &s;o convenient, that it exceeds <HI>Haerlem;</HI> for <HI>Haerlem</HI> Lake lyeth but upon one Quarter of the Town, and the Waters lye at <HI>Coventry</HI> about three parts of that Town. And I am &s;ure <HI>Coventry</HI> ought to be the chief|e&s;t place of this intended Linen Manufacture, and in few years would exceed <HI>Haerlem;</HI> God and Nature ha|ving fixed them right for it, both as to Land fit to bear Flax, good whitening, a large City in the very Centre of <HI>England,</HI> and their Woollen Manufacture being now wholly decayed. And in this City a Bank, by virtue of a voluntary Regi&s;ter, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and then the Gentlemen in the four Counties named may make their Sons Linen Merchants, and thereby be a means to help to beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> without fighting.</P>
<P>I have been &s;omething long upon this Theme, becau&s;e I hope and believe I may &s;ee &s;omething of the Improve|ment, by the Linen Trade, come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;ome other Que&s;tions will here be asked: As, who incouraged you to make this Di&s;cour&s;e of the Linen Im|provement, and who paid you for your pains in travel|ling to find the things here writ? I an&s;wer, I was an Apprentice to a Linen Draper, and &s;o I knew &s;omething
<PB N="56" REF="45">of Linen; and finding the Poor unimployed, I with my Wife did promote the making of much fine Linen with good &s;ucce&s;s. And being employed and my Char|ges born by twelve Gentlemen of <HI>England,</HI> to bring in|to <HI>England</HI> a Manufacture out of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bohemia</HI> made of Iron and Tin, there I did &s;ee what I here &s;et down; and in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> I tryed and ob&s;erved their way and manner of Trade in the Linen Manufa|cture: All which take you for nothing.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Manufacture to be incouraged to &s;et the poor people at work, being the growth and product of our own Kingdom, is that of Iron. But now I am &s;ure I &s;hall draw a whole Swarm of Wa&s;ps about my Ears. For &s;ay &s;ome (and many too who think them&s;elves very wi&s;e) it were well if there were no Iron-works in <HI>England;</HI> and it was better when no Iron was made in <HI>England:</HI> and the Iron-works de&s;troy all the Woods; and foreign Iron from <HI>Spain</HI> will do better and la&s;t longer. And I have heard many men both Rich and Sober often declare the&s;e things; and it hath been and is the opinion of nine parts of ten of the people of <HI>England,</HI> that it is &s;o, and by no arguments whatever will they be beat from the be|lief of it, although there is not one word true. As to the Fir&s;t, The Iron works at pre&s;ent in <HI>England</HI> are of the &s;ame value, and I believe much more to the publick than the Woollen Manufacture is, and is the cau&s;e of im|ploying near as many people, and much more Lands for Hor&s;es and Oxen to carry and recarry tho&s;e heavy com|modities of which the Iron is made, and the Iron, and the things made of the Iron. Therefore I will take the Kingdom half round, and &s;hew you what the Iron works do contribute to the Publick and to the whole Coun|tries.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="45">
<P>And Fir&s;t, I will begin in <HI>Monmouth-&s;hire,</HI> and go through the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean,</HI> and there take notice what infinite quantities of Raw Iron is there made, with Bar Iron and Wire; and con&s;ider the infinite number of Men, Hor&s;es, and Carriages which are to &s;upply the&s;e Works, and al&s;o digging of Iron Stone, providing of Cinders, carrying to the Works, making it into Sows and Bars, cutting of Wood, and converting it into Charcoal. Con|&s;ider al&s;o in all the&s;e parts the Woods are not worth the cutting and bringing home by the Owner to burn in their Hou&s;es: And it is becau&s;e in all the&s;e places there are Pit Coals very cheap. Con&s;ider al&s;o the multitude of Cat|tel and People thereabouts employed that make the Lands dear: And what with the benefit made of the Woods, and the People making the Land dear, it is not inferior for Riches to any place in <HI>England.</HI> And if the&s;e Advantages were not there, it would be little le&s;s than a howling Wilderne&s;s. I believe if this comes to the hands of Sir <HI>Baynom Frogmorton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Duncomb Col|che&s;ter,</HI> they will be on my &s;ide. Moreover, there is yet a mo&s;t great benefit to the Kingdom in general by the Sow Iron made of the Iron Stone and Roman Cinders in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean;</HI> for that Metal is of a mo&s;t gentle, pliable, &s;oft nature, ea&s;ily and quickly to be wrought in|to Manufacture, over what any other Iron is, and it is the be&s;t in the known World: and the greate&s;t part of this Sow Iron is &s;ent up <HI>Severne</HI> to the Forges, into <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter-&s;hire, Shrop&s;hire, Stafford-&s;hire, Warwick-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and there it's made into Bar-Iron: And becau&s;e of its kind and gentle nature to work, it is now at <HI>Stur|bridge, Dudly, Wolverhampton, Sedgley, Wa&s;all,</HI> and <HI>Bur|mingham,</HI> and thereabouts, wrought and manufactured into all &s;mall Commodities, and diffu&s;ed all <HI>England</HI> over,
<PB N="58" REF="46">and thereby a great Trade made of it; and when manu|factured &s;ent into mo&s;t parts of the World. And I can very ea&s;ily make it appear, that in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Deane,</HI> and thereabouts, and about the Materials that come from thence, there are employed, and have their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence therefrom, no le&s;s than &s;ixty thou&s;and per&s;ons. And certainly if this be true, then it is certain it is better the&s;e Iron-works were up and in being, than that there were none. And it were well if there were an Act of Parliament for inclo&s;ing all Commons fit or any way likely to bear Wood in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Deane,</HI> and &s;ix Miles round the Fore&s;t; and that great quantities of Timber might by the &s;ame Law be there pre&s;erved, for to &s;upply in future Ages Timber for Shipping and Building. And I dare &s;ay the Fore&s;t of <HI>Deane</HI> is, as to the Iron, to be compared to the Sheeps back, as to the Wollen: No|thing being of more advantage to <HI>England</HI> than the&s;e two are. And if Woods are not pre&s;erved in and near the Fore&s;t, to &s;upply the Works for future Ages, that Trade will le&s;&s;en and dye, as to <HI>England,</HI> and betake her &s;elf unto &s;ome other Nation or Country. And now in <HI>Worce&s;ter-&s;hire, Shrop&s;hire, Stafford-&s;hire, Warwick-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Derby-&s;hire</HI> there are great and numerous quantities of Iron-works, and there much Iron is made of Metal or Iron Stone of another nature quite different from that of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Deane.</HI> This Iron is a &s;hort &s;oft Iron, com|monly called Cold-&s;hore Iron, of which all the Nails are made, and infinite other Commodities: In which work are employed many more per&s;ons, if not double to what are employed in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Deane.</HI> And in all tho&s;e Countries the Gentlemen and others have Moneys for their Woods at all times when they want it, which is to them a great benefit and advantage; and the Lands in
<PB N="59" REF="46">mo&s;t of the&s;e places are double the rate that they would be at if there were not Iron-works there. And in all the&s;e Countries now named there is an infinite of Pit Coals, and the Pit Coals being near the Iron, and the Iron Stone growing with the Coals, there it is manufa|ctured very cheap, and &s;ent all <HI>England</HI> over, and to mo&s;t parts of the World. And if the Iron-works were not there, the Woods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> all the&s;e Countries to the Owners thereof would not be worth the cutting and carrying home, becau&s;e of the cheapne&s;s of the Coals and dura|tion thereof.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay &s;omething as to <HI>Notingham</HI> and <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> to <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> but I leave that to &s;ome other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en that knows the Countries better than I do. And in the&s;e Countries now mentioned there are many and va&s;t Commons, very natural and fit to bear Wood, which at pre&s;ent are of very little u&s;e to the publick. And for that in the&s;e parts there never will be any want of Pit Coals, to work and manufacture the Iron when once made into Bars, but Woods do much decay; and this being a thing of &s;uch great benefit to the publick, and in the &s;et|ting of the Poor at work; it were well that a Law might pa&s;s for inclo&s;ing all Commons fit and apt to bear wood, which are and lye within twelve Miles of the Town of <HI>Sturbridge</HI> in the County of <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> and that in &s;uch inclo&s;ed Copices there may be provi&s;ion made to pre&s;erve Timber, now much wanting in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The next Objection is, That it was better when there was no Iron made in <HI>England;</HI> But when that was, nei|ther I nor the Objector knows. For in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Deane</HI> and thereabouts the Iron is made at this day of Cinders, being the rough and offal thrown by in the <HI>Romans</HI> time; they then having only foot-bla&s;ts to melt
<PB N="60" REF="47">the Iron Stone, but now by the force of a great Wheel that drives a pair of Bellows twenty foot long, all that Iron is extracted out of the Cinders which could not be forced from it by the <HI>Roman</HI> Foot-bla&s;t. And in the Fo|re&s;t of <HI>Deane</HI> and thereabouts, and as high as <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> there are great and infinite quantities of the&s;e Cinders; &s;ome in va&s;t Mounts above ground, &s;ome under ground, which will &s;upply the Iron-works &s;ome hundreds of years, and the&s;e Cinders are they which make the prime and be&s;t Iron, and with much le&s;s Charcoal than doth the Iron Stone. And certainly this being &s;o, it will be great policy for the Government timely to con&s;ider and weigh the great benefit Iron-works are to the&s;e pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"> and to the Kingdom and People in general; and therefore to begin to countenance them, in pre&s;erving Woods for their continuation and duration.</P>
<P>The next thing is, Iron-works de&s;troy the Woods and Timber. I affirm the contrary; and that Iron-works are &s;o far from the de&s;troying of Woods and Timber, that they are the occa&s;ion of the increa&s;e thereof. For in all parts where Iron-works are, there generally are great quantities of Pit Coals very cheap, and in the&s;e places there are great quantities of Copices or Woods which &s;upply the Iron-works: And if the Iron-works were not in being, the&s;e Copices would have been &s;tocked up, and turned into Pa&s;ture and Tillage, as is now daily done in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Surry,</HI> where the Iron-works, or mo&s;t of them, are laid down. And in <HI>Gloce&s;ter-&s;hire, Worce&s;ter|&s;hire, Warwick, Salop,</HI> and <HI>Stafford</HI> Shires are va&s;t and in|finite quantities of Copices, wherein there are great &s;tore of young Timber growing; and if it were not that there could be Moneys had for the&s;e Woods by the Owners from the Iron Ma&s;ters, all the&s;e Copices would be &s;tocked
<PB N="61" REF="47">up, and turned into Tillage and Pa&s;ture, and &s;o there would be neither Woods nor Timber in the&s;e places: And the Rea&s;on is, Pit Coal in all the&s;e places, con&s;ider|ing the duration and cheapne&s;s thereof, is not &s;o chargea|ble to the Owner of the Woods as cutting and carrying the Woods home to his Hou&s;e. And as to making Char|coal with Timber in tho&s;e parts, &s;o much talked of, it was and is mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; for Timber in all the&s;e parts is worth thirty &s;hillings a Tun, and a Tun and three quarters of Timber will but make one Coard of Wood. So let all rational men con&s;ider, whether an Iron Ma&s;ter will cut up Timber to the value of fifty &s;hillings, to make one Coard of Wood, when he pays for his Wood in mo&s;t of the&s;e places but &s;even &s;hillings a Coard?</P>
<P>Now I have &s;hewed you the two Manufactures of Linen and Iron with the product thereof, and all the materials are with us growing; and the&s;e two Manu|factures will if by Law countenanced &s;et all the poor in <HI>England</HI> at work, and much inrich the Country, and thereby fetch people into the Kingdom, whereas now they depart; and thereby deprive the <HI>Dutch</HI> of the&s;e two great Manufactures of Iron and Linen: I mean Iron wrought into all Commodities, &s;o va&s;tly brought down the <HI>Rhine</HI> into <HI>Holland</HI> from <HI>Leige, Gluke, Soley</HI> and <HI>Co|logne,</HI> and by them diffu&s;ed and &s;ent all the World over. And the&s;e two Trades being well fixed here, will help to beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> without fighting. I pray con&s;ider the charge <HI>England</HI> is now at with the poor, and ob&s;erve what they now co&s;t the Publick; but if imployed in the&s;e two Manufactures, what advance by their Labour might the publick receive? Admit there be in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> a hundred thou&s;and poor people unimployed, and each one co&s;ts the publick four pence the Day in food, and if
<PB N="62" REF="48">the&s;e were imployed they would earn eight pence the day; and &s;o the publick in what might be gained and &s;aved will advance twelve pence the day by each poor per&s;on now unimployed. So a hundred thou&s;and per|&s;ons will be to the benefit of the publick if imployed, one Million and a half yearly in the&s;e two Manufactures of Iron and Linen. And as the&s;e two Manufactures are now managed in <HI>Saxony,</HI> they &s;et all their poor at work, I travelling aworter and a-cro&s;s <HI>Saxony</HI> did not &s;ee one beg|ger there; and the&s;e two Manufactures being prudently, and by good Laws there &s;upported and encouraged, they are become two parts in three of the Revenue and benefit of that Duke, and they are &s;ent into <HI>England</HI> at this time in great quantities, all paying Cu&s;toms in ten &s;everal places before they come here.</P>
<P>And that the Linen and Iron Manufactures may be &s;o incouraged here by a publick Law, as that we may draw the&s;e Trades &s;olely to us, which now foreign Nations re|ceive the benefit of, there ought in the fir&s;t place to be a Tax or Cu&s;tom at lea&s;t of four &s;hillings in the pound put on all Linen Yarn, Threads, Tapes and Twines for Cordage that &s;hall be imported into <HI>England,</HI> and three &s;hillings in the pound upon all Linen Clothes under four &s;hillings the Ell; and this Law to be and continue for &s;even years. And by vertue of this Tax or Impo&s;ition there will be &s;uch advantage given to the Linen Manufacture in its Infancy, that thereby it will take deep rooting and get a good Foundation on a &s;udden, (the con&s;equence whereof will do and bring to pa&s;s the great things formerly mention|ed.)</P>
<P>And as to the Incouragement of the Iron, and Iron Manufactures, there &s;hould be three pound a Tun Cu|&s;tom, laid on all foreign Barr Iron imported, and &s;ix
<PB N="63" REF="48">pounds the Tun on all the Manufactured Iron imported into <HI>England;</HI> and by the&s;e two ways, namely by a Tax being laid upon the imported Barr Iron, Iron Wares, and Thread, Tape, Twine, and Linen Cloth of all &s;orts, all the Trade of the&s;e things will be here, and all the Poor &s;et at work, the <HI>Dutch</HI> robbed of one of their great|e&s;t Flowers, and to the King and people in general at lea&s;t &s;ix Millions a year advantage. The rea&s;ons how and upon what grounds it will be &s;o; as al&s;o the rea&s;ons why the Commons in the Countries afore mentioned ought to be inclo&s;ed for Wood and Timber, you may ex|pect in the &s;econd part.</P>
<P>But I know there will be a parcel of at lea&s;t eight Anchor Smiths near <HI>London</HI> that will make a great Noi&s;e again&s;t laying a Tax upon foreign Iron, and give many wi&s;e rea&s;ons for it, and at la&s;t endeavour to knock all on the head, urging that it will be of great prejudice to the King, for it will cau&s;e him to pay dear for all his Iron that &s;hall be made u&s;e of for his Naval Force. But the King need not fear that, for he may if he plea&s;e have &s;ufficient of his own at half the rates he pays now for it, (and good quan|tities to &s;ell to others) and made at the place before men|tioned near <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI> But there is &s;omething that may be of wor&s;e con&s;equence than ordi|nary, if the Iron Manufacture be not incouraged. At pre&s;ent mo&s;t of the Works in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Surry</HI> are laid down, and many in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and many in other parts mu&s;t follow, if not prevented by inclo&s;ing Commons to &s;upply them with Wood. And when the greate&s;t part of the Iron-works are a&s;leep, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion for great quantities of Guns and Bullet, and other &s;orts of Iron Commodities for a pre&s;ent unexpected War, and the <HI>Sound</HI> happen to be lockt up, and &s;o pre|vent
<PB N="64" REF="49">Iron coming to us; truly we &s;hould then be in a fine ca&s;e! Therefore if the Iron De&s;ign at <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> go on, it may do well; for Store will be no &s;ore.</P>
<P>I hope now I have plainly made it appear, that by the two Manufactures of Iron and Linen, being incouraged as is &s;et down, all the poor People of <HI>England</HI> may be &s;et at work.</P>
<P>That nothing may be wanting that may conduce to the benefit and incouragement of things manufactured, as in cheap carriage to and fro over <HI>England,</HI> and to the Sea at ea&s;ie rates, I will in the next place &s;hew you how the great Rivers in <HI>England</HI> may be made Navigable, and thereby make the Commodities and Goods carried, e&s;pecially in Winter time, for half the rate they now pay. Therefore you mu&s;t know that the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Severne</HI> are the two great Ma&s;ter Rivers, that run farthe&s;t into the Inlands of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o into the Seas, and the&s;e Rivers are both of them already Navigable; <HI>Thames</HI> as far as <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Severne</HI> from the <HI>Welch</HI> Pool (or with|in two Miles of it) to <HI>Bri&s;toll:</HI> But one of the&s;e Rivers running directly South, the other Ea&s;t, they are di&s;tant in the neare&s;t place forty Miles from each other, and &s;o there is no advantage made of the&s;e two eminent Rivers, in being helpful one to the other in point of Carriage. But it was about ten years &s;ince projected (and a Bill brought into the Hou&s;e) to make the&s;e two great Rivers communicable, by making a new Cut from <HI>Lechlode</HI> along near <HI>Criclett</HI> into <HI>Avon,</HI> and &s;o down <HI>Avon</HI> to <HI>Bath,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Bri&s;toll.</HI> And a Map was drawn for Mr. <HI>Ma|thews</HI> by Mr. <HI>Moxon</HI> to demon&s;trate the thing. Many Lords and Gentlemen were ingaged in it; among&s;t which were the Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI> But &s;ome fooli&s;h Di&s;cour&s;e at Coffee-hou&s;es laid a&s;leep

But this Summer my Son hath twice &s;urveyed the River <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Charwel,</HI> and it is very evident and clear that the <HI>Charwel</HI> may be made Navigable to <HI>Banbury,</HI> and the River <HI>Stower</HI> from <HI>Shipton</HI> clear into <HI>Avon</HI> River two miles below <HI>Stratford,</HI> the River <HI>Avon</HI> being already made Navi|gable into the <HI>Severn;</HI> and &s;o there will be by making the <HI>Charwel</HI> Navigable from <HI>Oxford</HI> to <HI>Banbury,</HI> and the <HI>Stower</HI> from <HI>Shipton</HI> to <HI>Avon,</HI> a Communication of the&s;e two great Rivers for Water carriage within eight miles.

<P>THere Ma&s;ons, Carpenters, Brick-layers and Joyners at their making Free, are put into the Li&s;t with the re&s;t to be alwayes ready to help to quench and prevent the &s;preading of Fires; Fifteen of the Sub&s;tantial Citi|zens Commi&s;&s;ionated for to look to the well ordering of all things relating thereunto; an Engineer and his A&s;|&s;i&s;tants made and &s;etled; two Sentinels appointed with Hou&s;es built for to hold the Water Engins in, and to put in the Engineers Ingredients, and Goods taken from all Hou&s;es on Fire or to be blown up; Sleds and Copper Tubs made.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being made and done, then the Sen|tinel hath a Place on the top of the highe&s;t Steeple whereby he may look all over the Town; one is by Day, the other by Night; and every two Hours in the Night he plays half an hour upon a Flagelet, being very
<PB N="68" REF="57">delightful in the Night: and he looks round the City; if he ob&s;erves any Smoak or Fire or danger of Fire, he pre&s;ently &s;ounds a Trumpet and hangs out a bloody Flag, towards that Quarter of the City where the Fire is. Im|mediately all the people which are for the quenching of the Fires, with the Commi&s;&s;ioners and Engineers, or as many as are in Town, run to the place; and pre&s;ently the Commi&s;&s;ioners or any two of them with the Engineers give the nece&s;&s;ary orders for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of the Fire, either by pulling down or blowing up the Hou&s;es. All the Labourers obey in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to pull down, carrying the goods that mu&s;t be removed to the Hou&s;es appointed, fetching the Water being ready filled in Copper Tubs upon Sleds which is quickly done, for that the Sleds, Tubs and Water with the place where they &s;tand are order'd &s;o, a Hor&s;e may come at them; and there are two Cocks to &s;upply with Water, one upon the one &s;ide of the &s;pace where the Tubs are, and the other on the o|ther &s;ide: &s;o the Empty Tubs are filled as they return, whereby no Water can be wanting. And one &s;ide of the &s;quare are the Hou&s;es for the Water Engins; the Rooms at the end of the &s;quare are for the Engineers In|gredients; and the other &s;ide of the &s;quare is Rooms to put &s;uch goods in as they take from the Hou&s;es that are blown up or pulled down or pre&s;erved from the Fire. The Copper Tubs are fixed upon the Sleds in the open &s;quare; and all the Doors of the buildings are made out|wards,
<PB N="69" REF="57">by which the people may come to the Tubs of Water with Hor&s;es backwards and forwards uninterrupt|ed. And all other per&s;ons may come to the &s;everal Rooms one not interrupting the other. And this is a &s;quare piece of Land in &s;ome convenient place in the City. And things being thus fitted and ordered, upon breaking out of Fire, immediately every man is at work according to order; and it is very &s;eldom that above three Hou&s;es are ruined by Fire in any of the&s;e Cities. And if this prevention, Rule and Order were not, it's impo&s;&s;ible but upon the breaking out of Fire the greate&s;t part of the Cities would be de&s;troyed; for that many Cities are built of Fir, which is very full of Turpentine. Now with us in <HI>England</HI> upon the breaking out of great Fires, all the Rable runs crying Fire, Fire, to the great affrightment and amazement of mo&s;t people near where the Fire is, and makes it wor&s;e than really it is, which cau&s;eth the remove of goods to their great lo&s;s and detri|ment. Be&s;ides, the&s;e &s;orts of &s;udden Frights co&s;t many Poor Women their Lives; and &s;ometimes it goeth near the Man too. And another &s;ort of people run to Rob and Steal, and it's feared to increa&s;e the Fires into the Bargain, that they may better bring to pa&s;s their wicked ends. Then one cries, Pull down, and another cries, Blow up this Hou&s;e, another cries, Blow up that Hou&s;e. So grows a confu&s;ion not to be parallel'd. One &s;tands in the way of another. Many Poor Souls do their be&s;t to
<PB N="70" REF="58">prevent the &s;preading abroad of the Fire, and for want of Judgment are many times de&s;troyed. Then comes &s;ome per&s;on in Authority or other and he cries, Fetch Powder to blow up this Hou&s;e or that Hou&s;e; and no Powder at pre&s;ent is to be had; at la&s;t when the Fire hath got great head, then the Powder comes; Blow up this Hou&s;e, &s;aith the Gentleman, the multitude cry, no, no, Blow up that Hou&s;e. There they are as it were at the building of <HI>Babel,</HI> all in confu&s;ion. But pray you write by this copy here &s;et you, and then the Fires may be prevented, the peoples fears allay'd and their minds quieted, the great and mi&s;erable Calamities that Fires occa&s;ion, prevented, and all people lye quiet in their Beds except tho&s;e imploy|ed. And then in &s;uch a great City as <HI>London</HI> is, many Fires would be over and quenched, before the twentieth part of the people in the City did know there were any Fire at all. And certainly if ever &s;uch a thing as this take place, it is high time now it were done. I have here annexed the Hou&s;es built, Tubs upon the Sleds, and if you would have me to do more, I cannot. Only I can tell you for <HI>London</HI> and the Suburbs this Rule would do well in three places; <HI>Viz.</HI> in St. <HI>Martins</HI> Steeple in the Fields one Sentinel, in St. <HI>Sepulchres</HI> Steeple another, and in the Monument another. And all things done as is here pre&s;cribed, your fears would be quickly gone, the Hou&s;es would rai&s;e Rents, and men would pur|cha&s;e Hou&s;es that would now &s;ell tho&s;e they have if they could.</P>

<P>WHat News from <HI>London,</HI> old Friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no News, but the old news, A bad Trade &s;till.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; for you <HI>Clothiers,</HI> and we <HI>Drapers,</HI> are both betwixt one and the &s;ame pair of Mil&s;tones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by that, Friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, do you not know? I mean the <HI>Factors, Drawers,</HI> and <HI>Packers,</HI> are now turned Merchants, and the Trade is ruined by them: Formerly it was you <HI>Clo|thiers,</HI> and we <HI>Drapers,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">d now it is another thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Sir,</HI> you &s;ay true, it is &s;o; and I have been often thinking of it, and &s;peaking too, as loud as I dur&s;t, to my Neighbour <HI>Smith</HI> concerning it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, by &s;aying you &s;peak as loud as you dur&s;t? Are you afraid of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed <HI>Sir,</HI> they are now become to us, as the <HI>Lawyer</HI> is to his Client; we dare not &s;ay what we know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? I know you are a rich Man, and need not fear; and by telling the truth, you may relieve many a Man, and do good to the Trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would be willing to do what good lieth in my power, but men of our Trade are &s;o much divided, and the poorer &s;ort are &s;o afear'd of the Factors, if they &s;hould offer to relieve them&s;elves, and &s;eek out any o|ther
<PB N="98" REF="62">way, the Factors would joyn &s;tock together, and &s;et up our Trade in &s;ome other place, and &s;o undo our Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, that's impo&s;&s;ible; &s;urely no Men will be &s;o ba&s;e, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that have been your Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what I &s;ay is true: And in a Town in <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> this pre&s;ent time, I know it is their condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray, what Town is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is <HI>Kiddermin&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> where they make the Stuffs for Hangings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the Factors that belong to that Town, they are very hone&s;t men, and will not do any &s;uch thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true what I &s;ay, for lately &s;ome friends of the Clothiers of <HI>Kidderminster,</HI> and &s;ome Uphol&s;terers, con|&s;ulted how to bring the <HI>Kiddermin&s;ter</HI> Trade to be good to both, it being a Trade that is much deba&s;ed and &s;poiled by the Factors; and having brought it near to pa&s;s, the be&s;t of the Factors &s;ent Letters to the Clothi|ers, and acquaints them, that the Stuffs may be made el&s;ewhere as well as there, (and much more) which did &s;o affright the Clothiers, that they dur&s;t not agree to fix their Trade in two hands, although it might have been Five or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year in the Trades way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doth any one know this be&s;ides you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all the Town will tell you it is &s;o; and I can bring you to a Man in <HI>London,</HI> can tell you the whole Story, who treated the Uphol&s;terers, and got two Mer|chants to lend the Trade Five or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds to help to drive the Trade, that &s;o it might be done with profit and ea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, old Friend, I do believe you; for <HI>Kidder|min&s;ter</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="62">Factors have &s;poiled the Weavers and the Up|hol&s;terers Trade, as our <HI>Blackwell-hall</HI> Factors, Pack|ers, and Drawers, have &s;poiled your Trade and ours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Sir,</HI> it is even &s;o: and what can &s;uch a one as I do, &s;eeing a whole Town &s;tand in fear of Three or four Factors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, you know when you and I dealt toge|ther fir&s;t, when <HI>I. A.</HI> was a good Clothier, and <HI>I.</HI> of <HI>Leck</HI> a good Wool-man, it was not &s;o; then the Factors were your Servants, and the Packers and Drawers were ours: Will you Clothiers joyn with us Drapers, to &s;ee if we can reduce the Trade to the old good condition it was in formerly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will with all my heart, and &s;o will all the Clo|thiers in our Country too; I will undertake for them: for we are almo&s;t at Beggars-bu&s;h, and we cannot tell how to help our &s;elves: And our Trade grows wor&s;e and wor&s;e, we make no profit of our Commodities.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, I under&s;tand you are di&s;cour&s;ing of your Trade, of making Cloth, and &s;elling Cloth; as I have club'd with you for Supper, &s;o I pray let me club a little with you in Di&s;cour&s;e; for I am as highly con|cerned in the thing you Di&s;cour&s;e of, as you are; for every Acre of my Land ri&s;es price, according as the Woollen Manufacture flouri&s;hes: If Wool be dear, my Tenants Wife and Children have work in Spinning and Carding, and Rent's paid at the day, and none left in arrears: And then we have a merry Sheep-&s;heering, and with Two years Wool, I can Marry <HI>Jugg,</HI> or <HI>Be&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>Pray what Country-man are you? I live at <HI>Sa|lisbury.</HI> Indeed a fine Town of Trading in the Woollen Manufactures, but much decayed of late years. What Country-man is this Gentleman, your Friend? He lives at <HI>London.</HI> Well mu&s;t he.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not joyn with the <HI>Salisbury</HI> Clothier: for I thought all Clothiers had of late removed to <HI>Tanton-Dean,</HI> and there-abouts; becau&s;e that place is under a Regi&s;ter, and Moneys may be had at Five in the Hun|dred at any time, to drive their Trades with ea&s;e, com|fort, and profit.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I confe&s;s they are at a lo&s;s, and yet they have the wi&s;e&s;t Bi&s;hop of late that hath been there a great while; and &s;ome good things have been doing of late for that City, as making the River <HI>Avon</HI> Naviga|ble, and they are preparing to come under a Regi&s;ter, and all the Free-land within Ten miles of the City like|wi&s;e.</P>

<P>Now&punc; I am well &s;atisfied with corre&s;ponding with the Clothier; <HI>Salisbury</HI> hanging Regi&s;ter fa&s;hion, that is a bit I love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, now let us fall too, and con&s;ider of &s;ome good things to advance the Woollen Manufa|ctures; I will acquaint the Drapers, and you mu&s;t the Clothiers, and you the Country-men; and &s;o every one u&s;e his intere&s;t with the Authority, to amend what is ami&s;s.</P>

<SP>

<P>Hold, hold, you drive too fa&s;t; there is a &s;nake in the Bu&s;h; although I live in the Country, yet I come to <HI>London</HI> &s;ometimes, and at the <HI>Coffee-hou&s;es</HI> I heard &s;trange News, which made me &s;tare: And now we are to &s;et forward &s;o good a work, let us &s;ee how to clear the foundation, and take away the Rubbi&s;h.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> what is the &s;trange News you hear at <HI>Coffee-hou&s;es?</HI> It is generally idle Twit twot Di&s;cour&s;e, not worth ones minding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard at the <HI>Rainbow Coffee-hou&s;e,</HI> That the people in, and near <HI>London,</HI> have of late years lent a|bout One hundred thou&s;and pounds without Intere&s;t, for Four years, to be imployed in the Woollen Manu|facture near <HI>Conmell</HI> in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and by the &s;trength of that Moneys, to carry away our people out of the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and there make Cloth and Stuffs; and when made, then carried to <HI>Spain, France, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Germany:</HI> And there, with cheap Wool, and cheap Victuals, Manufactured, and &s;o do mighty things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You live in <HI>London,</HI> and you know whether there be any &s;uch thing as this is; if it be &s;o, we Clothiers
<PB N="102" REF="64">may go hang our &s;elves; Moneys without Intere&s;t for Four years, cheap Wool, and cheap Beef, carried to <HI>Holland</HI> together, and made Cloth there: If this be &s;o, I'le never weave more: I will burn my Beam, and run away by the Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Old Friend, our Country-man is under a mi&s;take; be not in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, he told you he heard &s;o in a <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> is there any thing like it? for there cannot be &s;uch a &s;moke as this is, and no fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you what the thing is he means. There are a certain number of per&s;ons, who they &s;ay, have imployed &s;ome &s;uch Sum as is &s;poken of, to &s;et up the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and indeed now it comes into my mind, I remember I have heard of their taking over many People (out of the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI>) and &s;ending the Cloth and Stuffs when made, to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and al&s;o Wool and Beef with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray, had they the Moneys without intere&s;t for Four years, to do <HI>England</HI> (and the Clothing Trade) this good turn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter upon what terms, &s;o the thing be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, Now I &s;ee this Country-man was near the mark; and I will even burn my Loom and Beam too, for I &s;ee all the World are mad. Here is the Moneys gone (and taken out of Trade in <HI>England</HI>) and carried into <HI>Ireland;</HI> and our People too, with this Money, make Cloth, and &s;erve it cheap in all places where we &s;end our Cloth; and carry to <HI>Holland</HI> cheap Wool, and cheap Victuals, and pay the Moneys back again in Four years: I will go to <HI>London,</HI> and tell my Lord Mayor of this fine Jig, let who will go to <HI>Salisbury</HI> for me.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="103" REF="64">

<P>Old Friend, the wor&s;t is over, do not trouble your &s;elf; That which is pa&s;t, cannot be help'd: But you will &s;ee no more &s;uch doings as has been of late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven grant it prove &s;o. There is now a great Art in trade as they &s;ay at <HI>Coffee-hou&s;es,</HI> and we mu&s;t do as we may, or el&s;e not trade at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do as we may! pray &s;peak out, What is that we mu&s;t do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get great &s;ums of Money upon credit, and im|ploy it hoodwinkt, Have at this, have at that, and have at the other; and if we lo&s;e all, we lo&s;e none of our own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You my two Friends, let us &s;ee how we may proceed to do the Trade &s;ome good, for it is high time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not over and pa&s;t? is it not too late to &s;et out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Let us prepare a Bill for the next Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and Petition for prohibiting of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-Wools Tran&s;portation, and the In&s;pecting of the <HI>All|nagers</HI> Office: And let the Factors, Packers, and Draw|ers, be put in their right places: And let the We&s;tern-Cloths be Shipt of at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to prevent the charge of carriage to <HI>London;</HI> and let the Fullers earth be &s;e|cured, and let all Cloth and Stuffs be made to the Stan|dard, and let all the Free-land in and near the Cloath|ing Towns and Cities, be put into a voluntary Regi&s;ter: And then nothing will be able to harm our Woollen-Trade any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, Now I like you; I will do any thing I can; but pray, what is that you &s;ay of putting our Hou&s;es and Free-land under a Voluntary Regi&s;ter? what good will that do to our Trade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>it will &s;trangely advance Trade, and bring Mo|neys
<PB N="104" REF="65">to Four in the hundred; and your Lands Regi&s;tred will be ready Money at all times, as you have occa&s;ion to u&s;e it; and your Land ri&s;e purcha&s;e to Thirty years, and then you may at any time have Spani&s;h-Wool in <HI>London,</HI> or Wool in the Country, or Monies to an&s;wer your occa&s;ions, and all upon a Ticket upon your Lands Regi&s;tered. So there will be no need of Friends to be bound, or Lawyers to make Conveyances, or hindring your bu&s;ine&s;s (and then the Tables will be turned): For you Clothiers will be then the Bankers; for now all Mo|ney runs out of Trade; then all Money will run into Trade, becau&s;e your Land is Regi&s;tred; and your per|&s;onal E&s;tates together, will be firm Security for all Mo|neys borrowed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, This, as you &s;ay, is already at <HI>Tanton Dean;</HI> and People &s;ay it is in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> too; but if we &s;hall have it at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> I will keep Loom and Beam too, and put <HI>Tom</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> to my own Trade; I thought to put them to Sea, for I could &s;ee nothing for them to do with me as things were: But when &s;hall we have this Office of Voluntary Regi&s;ter &s;et up? For I like one word very well as you &s;ay, A Voluntary Regi&s;ter; I like that marvellous well, and I have nothing to &s;ay again&s;t it; for it &s;eems he that will Regi&s;ter may; and he that will not, may chu&s;e: This is no more in plain <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> then give us leave to be hone&s;t. Sir, This is good News, I will tell all our Trade of this; for now we may be hone&s;t if we will, I am &s;ure it is high time; for as things are, the Lawyers cannot make us hone&s;t. But &s;till I beg to know when this mu&s;t be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Bill is to be carried into the Hou&s;e the next &s;itting of Parliament; and &s;ome Lords, Parliament|men, and Gentlemen and &s;ome hone&s;t and great Lawyers,
<PB N="105" REF="65">are for it, becau&s;e it will pay the Gentlemans Debts without Money, and beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> without Fight|ing; and bring Honour, Hone&s;ty, Riches, and Strength, and a great Trade to <HI>England:</HI> And it is &s;aid, it will double the Kings Revenue, and make him Po|tent and Strong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bores, this is the be&s;t News that ever I heard: I'le go home to <HI>Salisbury</HI> now, and tell all my Friends of this; and I hope to &s;ee then this good Voluntary Regi&s;ter brought to pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Old aquaintance, I am glad to &s;ee you &s;o well &s;atisfied now: If you once get a Voluntary Re|gi&s;ter, you will want Men of your own Trade in Par|liament, to let them know what is be&s;t to be done for the good of the Trade, which Lawyers and Gentle|men cannot tell how to do: For in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, a Cobler taught the Council how Leather might be Ordered, Tanned, and Dre&s;&s;ed for the good of the Publique: and thereupon many good Laws were made for that purpo&s;e; you may &s;ee the Story in Print; It is a Di&s;cour&s;e between my Lord <HI>Burley</HI> and a Cob|ler.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Now you &s;peak to the purpo&s;e; for what you &s;ay, has been in my Noddle the&s;e Six or Seven years; and I am &s;ure I have told a Neighbour of mine I did not like it: and I feared our Parliament-Men did not know where our Grief lay. But now I &s;ee the Old &s;aying is true, <HI>Every Man is a Fool when he is out of his own way.</HI> Come, let us Clothiers be all for the Good Old way again: And if ever it &s;hould &s;o fall out, to have Men of our own Trades, for Members of Parlia|ment, then up goes the Golden-Fleece again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like your Di&s;cour&s;e very well; and now
<PB N="106" REF="66">you have brought your Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;omething. I was the &s;ilenter, becau&s;e I did &s;ee all tended to the good of the Wool, and the Trade, and Manufacture. And all the&s;e things being upon the Wheel for the Publique good, truly I will give my Clothing-Friend home with him to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> two patterns of Falling-Mills, one to go by Water, to be &s;et up in a Barge upon the River <HI>Avon</HI> at <HI>Harnam</HI>-Bridg, by the City, to Scour and Thicken their cour&s;e-Clothes; and another to go by Wind, to be &s;et up near the Town-&s;ide, to Full and Thicken the fine Clothes, which will much out-do all other Mills now in u&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> as to make the Cloth feel fine and &s;oft. The Pattern of the Wind-Mill for thickning fine Clothes, is taken from the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Harlem</HI> in <HI>Holland;</HI> the Pattern of the Mill in a Barge to thicken and &s;cour cour&s;e Clothes, is ta|ken from one upon the <HI>Elb,</HI> near the Bridg at <HI>Drai&s;|den</HI> in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>

<SP>

<P>Sir, I am now infinitely beholding to you; and this you &s;ay of a Wind-Mill to Scoure and Thicken our fine Clothes, and make them feel fine and &s;oft, will do our bu&s;ine&s;s; for indeed, they are the <HI>Dutch</HI> that out-do us that way: and you &s;ay it is &s;o done at <HI>Har|lem;</HI> and I hear at <HI>Blackwell Hall,</HI> that the fine Clothes were made at <HI>Harlem.</HI> Good Sir, how are the&s;e Mills made, and in what manner? and what do they do when the Wind cea&s;es blowing, the Cloth being in the middle of its thickning? and what do they do for Water to come into the Cloth, when it is Thick|ning and Scouring?</P>

<P>Sir, I will acquaint you with all particulars, and then I will give you afterward, the de&s;cription of the Mill in the Barge, and the Mill that goeth by Wind.
<PB N="107" REF="66">At <HI>Harlem</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> they have Windmills to thicken and &s;cour their fine and <HI>&s;uper</HI>-fine clothes, built clo&s;e by the City-&s;ide; the Mill is are made in all points, as the Saw-Windmill on the <HI>Bank-&s;ide</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> over-again&s;t the <HI>Savoy;</HI> and it turns round, that is, the whole Fabrick turns; whereby it catches the Wind at all points: And there are Six or Eight Fallers (or Feet) which are taken and lifted up by the Axle-tree, which the Fanns are fa&s;tned in, and &s;o fall down-right into a Box, or Che&s;t, wherein the Cloth lyeth; and the Che&s;t is &s;o made and ordered, and the Fallers &s;o fitted, that the Cloth turns round in the Che&s;t, and the Square or hole the Faller drops into, is &s;o curiou&s;ly and clo&s;e made, that a Man cannot get his Knife into the Che&s;t betwixt the Wood and the Faller; and all other parts of the Trough and Che&s;t where the Cloth lyeth, is made clo&s;e and tite, and thereby the Wind and Air is kept from coming into the Che&s;t when the Cloth is thickning; and in ca&s;e the Wind cea&s;es blowing, they do either take the Cloth out of the Che&s;t, and lay it on drift, whereby it takes no harm; or el&s;e keep it clo&s;e in the Che&s;t, that no Air can come to it: But the Mills are &s;o ordered, that they are made to &s;cour more Clothes than they thicken; and if the Wind cea&s;es, they let the Fallers that are to &s;cour, &s;tand &s;till: And for Water, it is pumpt up by force of the Wind to a good height, and &s;o conveyed into the Che&s;t, to the Cloths, by little Spouts, as there is occa&s;ion. In <HI>Ger|many,</HI> near <HI>Poland,</HI> by rea&s;on of the dryne&s;s of the Countrey, and &s;mallne&s;s of the Rains, in Summer-time mo&s;t Rivers are much wanting in Water; Therefore the Mills for grinding of Corn, and thickning of Clothes, are made and fixt in Barges, upon the <HI>Elbe</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="67">near &s;ome Bridg (or in a quick &s;tream); And near the Bridg at <HI>Drai&s;den</HI> in <HI>Saxony,</HI> there they &s;cour and thicken their Clothes in Barges; the Mill is fixed in a Barge, and in &s;ome Barges are Two Mills. Ob&s;erve the Pattern, and I will &s;ave my labour of Writing; for by it you will &s;ee how it is in every particular.</P>

<P>Sir, Now I thank you a Thou&s;and times: for now we &s;hall be all Made at <HI>Salisbury;</HI> our River Made Na|vigable to fetch Mills from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and our City, and the Lands Ten Miles round it, put into a Regi&s;ter, and one Fulling-Mill made at <HI>Harlem</HI>-Bridg in a Barge, to &s;cour our Clothes, and a Windmill to thicken our Cloth, &s;et up by the City-&s;ide, &s;o that it may be as fine and &s;oft as <HI>Dutch</HI> Cloth. Well, if I &s;ee you at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> you &s;hall be made Free of that Cor|poration, and pay nothing, and Dine with our Bi&s;hop too, for he loves all tho&s;e things we have &s;o much di&s;|cour&s;ed of.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, Now we &s;ee we have met with a Tra|veller, and one that hath given us good Di&s;cour&s;e, and he &s;peaks as though he were practical in things; when I &s;aw him fir&s;t, I did not expect this from him: And this la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e is convenient for all the Clothing-Towns in <HI>England</HI> to know, as well as <HI>Salisbury;</HI> for all Towns have need of the&s;e Fulling-Mills. And I will get it Printed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, good Friend, do not Print it: for we will have all the benefit of the&s;e Mills to our &s;elves at <HI>Salisbury;</HI> for I have beat my Noddle a good while, con&s;idering of the rea&s;ons, why the Mills by Wind, &s;hould make the Cloth look the more fine, and feel more &s;oft, than if Fulled with our Mills by the open fleet (or Fullers): And I have it now, and I will &s;end &s;ome Queries to the <HI>Virtuo&s;oes</HI> about it; but I will tell
<PB REF="68">
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="109" REF="69">you how the Trick is: And if I had not been an old Clothier, and a Fulling-Boy when I was young, I could not have learnt it out. And it is &s;ure, our Fulling-Mills that we now have, our Fallers are taken up a great height, and &s;o fall down into the Stock upon the Cloth, and in its quick motion down, it contracts Wind, and brings it down with it into the Stock where the Cloth is, and &s;o the Wind and the Air being forced upon the Cloth, makes it hard, and cools it; and the Stock be|ing open, and the Cloth in it turning round in the Stock, doth al&s;o by the Wind and the Air it attracts, help to cool and harden the Cloth; whereas the Mills that go by Wind, the Fallers, or Feet, fall down perpendicular into the Stock, through a &s;quare hole, where the Cloth is, and &s;o attracts no Wind, nor can any Air get into the Stock or Che&s;t where the Cloth is; and therefore the Cloth is always kept in a con&s;tant heat and temper, which mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity bring it to good proof, and make it look very fine, and feel very &s;oft. I am re&s;olved, now I have got this knack, I'le pay the Reckoning.</P>

<P>Sir, Then print it all together, all that we have di&s;cour&s;ed of this Night, and I will pay Five pounds to|wards the charge, and &s;end the Printed Papers all over <HI>Wilt-&s;hire, Dor&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Summer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> except <HI>Taunton Dean:</HI> For they ought to have no benefit of Mills, becau&s;e they have had &s;uch a benefit of a Regi&s;ter.</P>

<P>Good Old Friend, it &s;hall be done; and I will get it put in, and bound up in a Book, which an ac|quaintance of mine is printing concerning Trade, and there is &s;omething in the Book that will &s;ute well with this di&s;cour&s;e of ours at this time.</P>

<P>I'le pay the reckoning, and quit this hone&s;t Countrey-mans Charge this Night, and to morrow too. And when I come to <HI>London,</HI> I'le tell our Friends all our good Fortunes, how we &s;hould rout tho&s;e that carried our Trade to <HI>Ireland, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and how we &s;hall out-do the <HI>Dutch</HI> in fine Cloth by a Fulling-Mill to go by Wind; and that we &s;hall never want Moneys again: and that <HI>Salisbury</HI> Clothiers &s;hall have no more need of Lawyers. A Voluntary Regi&s;ter! a pretty Trick! we now may be hone&s;t if we plea&s;e: I would I had met this Countrey-man Forty years ago, it had been Five hundred Nobles in my way, and my Fathers. Now we &s;hall make cheap-Cloth, pay no|thing to the poor, &s;et all a-work, and carry our Cloth to <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> by Water, and &s;o for Sea; and pay nothing to Lawyers, and have Moneys when we want it. We will agree quarterly with the Parrator, that will be but little. Come Boys, a brave Trade again! Come, heres three Healths in good SACK; here is our Countrey-mans Health: Here's a Health to the Man that makes the Wind-Mill; and a Health to him that brings this Voluntary Regi&s;ter to Town.

<P>Nay, hold Old Friend, I mu&s;t be gone early in the Morning: therefore let us agree where to meet in <HI>London,</HI> to &s;et forward the good things we now &s;o warmly have treated upon; for if we do not follow it clo&s;e, all this will come to nothing. <HI>Intere&s;t will not lie,</HI> every Man will be for his own Intere&s;t.</P>

<P>Slept well! no, for I did not &s;leep at all; for I have abundance of Wind-Mills in my Noddle now, &s;ufficient to &s;end all the Clothiers in our Town, and many more, to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> whither as I un|der&s;tand, &s;everal of them are packing already; but that way will never do our bu&s;ine&s;s to carry cheap Wool, and cheap Victuals into <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and there make it into Cloth, and &s;ell it there to whom they plea&s;e; and a Regi&s;ter, and a Bank, and Moneys at Four in the hundred, and Mills in Barges to thicken the cour&s;e Cloths by the very Town-&s;ide; and Wind-Mills to thicken, and full our fine Clothes; nor will it do our work to &s;ort and chu&s;e out the be&s;t Wool in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;end it to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> with good Beef, Butter, and Chee&s;e, <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-Tongues, and Tallow to light us to work by Nights, and to have good part of the cour&s;e Wool &s;pun in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and brought over to us in Yarn ready to Weave, and to &s;et on Foot on the out-&s;ides of our Town, the making of <HI>Beudley</HI>-capes, for they are made of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-Wool, and then &s;ent into <HI>Holland</HI> (to be Sold); and I hope Wool from <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and cheap Victuals with it, will do that bu&s;ine&s;s well there, and all the Stuffs that are for hangings, now made at <HI>Kiddermin&s;ter,</HI> &s;hall be made in <HI>Holland</HI> with <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-Wool, and &s;pun Linnen-Yarn, out of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> for they make the&s;e Stuffs of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-Wool, and
<PB N="110" REF="71"><HI>German</HI>-Yarn: and I am &s;ure &s;ome of the people of the&s;e Towns will quickly go away.</P>
<P>Another trick there is, of carrying Fullers-earth from <HI>Woborne</HI> to <HI>Lynn</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> as they pretend; and then Ship it to be carried to the Clothiers in the We&s;t: And when at Sea, a We&s;t-wind blows the Ship into <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> in <HI>Zealand.</HI> And we will have more Ful|lers-earth carried from <HI>Arundel</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> or to <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and there Ship'd, to &s;ecure the Clothi|ers in the North of <HI>England:</HI> And when that Ship is o|ver again&s;t <HI>Hull,</HI> a We&s;t-wind &s;hall blow her over to the <HI>Brill,</HI> or into the <HI>Texel,</HI> into <HI>Holland.</HI> And the&s;e two Ladings of Earth, with a little that &s;hall be brought over for Balla&s;t for Ships, will do mi&s;chief enough: For Trade will go where it is mo&s;t encouraged, and where the Merchant and Clothier can get mo&s;t by it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, old Friend, the&s;e tricks there are, and there are bad men enough, that will be apt enough to leave the Land where they were born; but let us &s;ee to help the&s;e matters: For if you &s;hould be one of them, all the Poor of the Countrey will be bound to cur&s;e you, and &s;o will the Rich too; for we have had men bad e|nough of our own Trade (but it will not become me to name Per&s;ons), who have provoked many Clothiers to &s;ell their e&s;tates, and Tran&s;port them&s;elves into the lower <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and there &s;et up the Clothing-Trade, which hath already quite &s;poiled our Cour&s;e-Cloth-Trade Ea&s;tward, and the Trade at <HI>Hamborough</HI> too; for if their Trade be &s;poil'd in <HI>England,</HI> they mu&s;t try if they can make it out &s;omewhere el&s;e; as in <HI>Ireland, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>Well Friend, for the conclu&s;ion of this Di&s;cour&s;e, we have no more to do, but to endeavour the redre&s;s
<PB N="113" REF="71">of the&s;e grievances, as far as in duty we may; and hum|bly to repre&s;ent to Authority the great advantage it may be to the publick to prevent the carrying of Fullers|earth out of the Land: To provide that all Factors, Packers, and Drawers, may be put in their proper pla|ces; That the illegal Tran&s;portation of Wools may be hindred, and the Trade of <HI>Ireland</HI> regulated: It would be of great ea&s;e and advantage, if our We&s;tern Clothes might be Tran&s;ported from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> beyond the Seas, to &s;ave the charge of carrying them to <HI>London.</HI> Many other particulars might be added, but this for the pre|&s;ent, till we meet next.</P>
</SP>
<P>NOW I have di&s;covered to you the way, manner, and method of &s;etting all the Poor in <HI>England</HI> at work, with the growth and product of our own Nation; with the particular means for bringing the &s;ame to pa&s;s; And Places a&s;&s;igned for the doing thereof; with the &s;ci|tuation and conveniences that are by God and Nature fixt in the&s;e Counties. Next, I will &s;hew you, That by the means and ways hereafter pre&s;cribed, all the poor people that are imployed in the&s;e Manufactures, &s;hall be in the &s;ame Counties fed with Bread &s;ufficient, without any charge to the Publick; and thereby the Commodities will be Manufactured cheap. The like benefit and advantage, infinite of the poor People of <HI>England</HI> in other parts will receive, by the way here-after &s;et down, taken exactly from the &s;ame things done in other places; whereby they work cheap, and &s;end infinite of their Manufactured Commodities into many parts of the World: And were they not fixt in the&s;e places beyond the Seas, in tho&s;e Manufactures and Po|licies,
<PB N="114" REF="72">the Princes of tho&s;e Countries, and their &s;ub|jects would be &s;trangely poor.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign now is, to &s;peak of Granaries to hold Corn, and to be fill'd in the time of plenty; and the advantage they are of, being well fixt in convenient places (with the benefit the Poor will receive by them, and the Rich al&s;o): And where ever Trade and Manu|facture is intended to be &s;et on foot, &s;o as to bring it to perfection, Granaries mu&s;t be made, and built in places convenient, to an&s;wer the ends de&s;igned.</P>
<P>The Great Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> hath three great Manu|factures; one of Iron, Tinn and Copper; another of Linnen, and &s;pun Threds of all &s;orts; the third of Saw|ed Timbers of all &s;orts: He hath convenienced them thus; As to his Iron, Tinn, and Copper, he hath fixt the&s;e works in the Valley, running from <HI>Segar-hutton,</HI> clear a-long by the Cities of <HI>Anaburgh, Sneburgh,</HI> and <HI>Mareauburgh,</HI> and down as far as <HI>Awe;</HI> and in the Hills and Mountains are his Minerals: In the Valleys are the Rivers, whereon are &s;et the Works. The Hills and Moun|tains, and at lea&s;t Ten Miles round, are full of Woods to &s;upply his Works; not one Acre of common-Land lyes wa&s;te: At the de&s;cent of the Hills, are infinite of Saw-Mills that go by Water, which Saw all manner of Firr and Oak; and in the Summer-time it is dragged to the River <HI>Elb,</HI> and &s;o &s;ent down to <HI>Hamborough.</HI> And things being thus fixt, with all advantages that Trade can de&s;ire, that Place is &s;trangely populous, and va&s;t|ly Rich, and yields to the Duke a great Revenue: And it lies as <HI>Wales,</HI> and as the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean</HI> doth to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the&s;e Wood-land Countries, lies the delight|ful Plain Countrey, wherein is the famous City of <HI>Lep|&s;ick,</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="72">very Rich in Corn and Flax; and &s;o it holds to <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> upon the Left-hand of <HI>My&s;on,</HI> with &s;ome Vine|yards: And in the&s;e delightful Countries, there is no wa&s;te Lands, but all under improvement. In all the great Towns, there are great Granaries for Corn; and in the Time of Plenty, they lay up for a Rainy-day: And &s;o there is &s;ufficient for the Poor at ea&s;ie rates at all times; whereby the Manufacture is always cheaply done, and thereby hath the advantage of &s;ending it to foreign Markets, and under-&s;ell others.</P>
<P>The next Country joyning to <HI>Saxony,</HI> is the Prince of <HI>Hainaults,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Parmburghs,</HI> with the Bi|&s;hoprick of <HI>Hall;</HI> wherein &s;tands the Cities of <HI>Salts, Wadell, Shenibank,</HI> and that brave old City of <HI>Mag|denburgh</HI> (de&s;troyed by Fire and Sword by Count <HI>Til|ly</HI>): The&s;e Countreys for Corn, as to Rye and Wheat, are &s;o plentiful, that no part of <HI>Europe</HI> can go before them, there being much Corn to &s;pare: In the Two Ci|ties of <HI>Shenibank</HI> and <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> are many Grana|ries, they lying upon the &s;ide of the <HI>Elbe:</HI> And in the City of <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> I was credibly informed (being Twice in that City), that there were Three hundred Granaries of all &s;orts; wherein Corn is kept &s;weet, and &s;afe from vermin, to admiration. The man|ner of the Granaries built, with the way of ordering of the Corn, and the benefit which is received thereby, you &s;hall have, when I &s;peak of Granaries &s;etting up in <HI>England.</HI> From hence the <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> People fetch their Wheat they make there Mum of; and down the <HI>Elb</HI> to <HI>Hamborough,</HI> is &s;ent infinite of Corn out of the Gra|naries; and from thence to all parts that &s;tand in need thereof: In the&s;e Countreys there is very little Manu|facture, only &s;ome cour&s;e Linnen, and Linnen-yarn:
<PB N="116" REF="73">The&s;e Granaries pre&s;erve the Corn Six, Eight, or Ten years, as good and &s;weet as when it was fir&s;t put in: There are great Merchants for Corn, and the Farm|ers lay up their Corn at ea&s;ie Rates, and &s;o have the be|nefit of their Straw yearly, and not Rick it up, as we do in <HI>England,</HI> to be devoured by Rats and Mice. There, Men and Maid-&s;ervants, and all other per&s;ons that have Monies, buy Corn when it is cheap, and lay it up till it be dear: And in the&s;e publick Granaries, the Corn is kept &s;afe, &s;weet, and well, a whole year, for a Half-peny a Bu&s;hel; and the Granary-Man gets by it. The like may be done in <HI>England;</HI> and that which now feeds Rats and Mice, and otherways con&s;umed, will &s;upply the greate&s;t part of the poor People of <HI>England</HI> with Bread, being pre&s;erved in Granaries.</P>
<P>Now I am for &s;aving the Corn in <HI>England,</HI> and keeping it &s;afe and &s;weet in Granaries (which is con&s;umed at pre|&s;ent by Rats and Mice) until there &s;hall be want and nece&s;&s;ity for it to be delivered to the Poor: In the Four Counties I name for the Linnen Manufacture, <HI>Oxford, Warwick, Leice&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> there ought to be Granaries to lay up Corn; the&s;e Coun|ties being great Corn-Counties: And at the head of the Navigable Rivers, are the places fit for &s;uch Gra|naries; and fir&s;t <HI>Wellinborough</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> or thereabouts. Secondly, &s;ome Town in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> within Four Miles of Kings-Mills; unto which Place <HI>Trent</HI> is Navigable. Thirdly, <HI>Banbury,</HI> if the River <HI>Sharwell</HI> be made Navigable to <HI>Banbury;</HI> or el&s;e about <HI>Bleckington,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;es</HI> Land, near <HI>An&s;lo</HI>-Bridg. And fifthly, <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon</HI> in <HI>Warwick|&s;hire.</HI> If Granaries were built in tho&s;e Places, to hold Corn there, it would be brought in with ea&s;e; and
<PB N="117" REF="73">when want and &s;carcity of Corn comes, it is then ready to be &s;ent down the Navigable Rivers, or to be di&s;per&s;t for the benefit of the Poor in the Countrey. <HI>Leice&s;ter|&s;hire</HI> is abounding in Corn, and when plenty there, it is very cheap, having no Navigable River near to carry it away; the like is <HI>Northampton&s;hire:</HI> But if Granaries were well &s;etled in the&s;e Places near <HI>Trent,</HI> and St. <HI>Ives</HI> River then it is ready for a Market, when it offers it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Lechload,</HI> at the Head of the River <HI>I&s;is,</HI> Ten Miles above <HI>Oxford,</HI> will be a very fit place for a Granary; for in thither will come great quantities of Corn out of <HI>Oxford, Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Berkshire:</HI> And there it will be ready upon all occa&s;ions, when wanted, either for the Poor, or to be tran&s;ported down the River to <HI>London,</HI> and other parts.</P>
<P><HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> will be a ve|ry good place to build Granaries to receive Corn; and I will affirm, if there were Three or Four large Grana|ries built in the Lands of Sir <HI>John Clapton,</HI> near the Bridg at <HI>Stratford,</HI> and well managed for the good of the Poor, and Linnen Trade; That on that &s;ide the River, there would be in a very &s;hort time as great a Town built, as <HI>Stratford</HI> now is; and there have as great a Trade as any City in tho&s;e parts of <HI>England</HI> (<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> only excepted): And the&s;e are my Rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, the River <HI>Avon</HI> being made Navigable to <HI>Strat|ford,</HI> the Barges that come up with Coles, and Mer|chants goods; by them, Corn will be taken back to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and up the River <HI>Severn,</HI> as far as the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI>-Pool. And Secondly, the Country near <HI>Stratford,</HI> as far as <HI>Banbury, Ayno-Dedinton, Bi&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Brak|ley,</HI> and round ot <HI>Daventry,</HI> is very full, and abounds
<PB N="118" REF="74">with good Corn; and the Carts that come to <HI>Stratford</HI> for Coles, would never come empty down, but bring Corn with them, if there were Granaries &s;ufficient to receive it: So you &s;ee all things would be fitted for &s;ore and back carriage: And I will affirm, No place in <HI>Eng|land</HI> can expect the benefit or advantage by any &s;uch Granaries, as <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon</HI> may; for that great and va&s;t quantities of Corn is rai&s;ed in tho&s;e parts, and when cheap, they cannot tell what to do with it, the ways being &s;o dirty and deep. But the advantage of the Navigation will &s;end it to &s;erve <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire, Wales, Shrop&s;hire, Che&s;hire,</HI> and other parts, in wet and un|&s;ea&s;onable years.</P>
<P>But the third and great Rea&s;on why this place &s;hall exceed all others in <HI>England,</HI> is this, There may as much Mum be made there, as at pre&s;ent is made at <HI>Brun&s;wick:</HI> And there Mum may be made and &s;ent into <HI>Ireland, We&s;t-Indies, France, Spain,</HI> and into the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> And the&s;e Granaries will be the occa&s;ion of get|ting away the Mum-Trade from <HI>Brun&s;wick:</HI> This &s;hews as like a <HI>Romance</HI> as doth the Title-page of my Book, unle&s;s I do give you rea&s;ons for what I &s;ay, and &s;hew you how it may be brought to pa&s;s, the which I will do: Ob&s;erve, the Mum at <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> is made of Wheat and the Wheat that it is made of, is brought from the Gra|naries at <HI>Magdenburg,</HI> and <HI>Shenibank,</HI> and it grows in the Vale of <HI>Parinburg;</HI> when it comes to <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> it is Malted, and &s;o made into Mum; and when made, then &s;ent by Land to the River <HI>Elb,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Hambo|rough:</HI> and from thence di&s;po&s;ed by Merchants unto all Parts: But the Mum at <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> is a Medicine, and drinks very nau&s;eous, and is not there drinkable at all; but that which makes it good, palitable, and
<PB N="119" REF="74">&s;trong, is its being long at Sea; There it is forc'd into a fermentation, and that keeps it working, whereby it alters the very property of the Liquor; and were it not to be &s;ent to Sea, that Trade at <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> would not be worth any thing; and to convince you further of the rea&s;on of what I &s;ay, take this one thing, and that will confirm you in the Truth of the re&s;t. Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer Brewed at <HI>London,</HI> and carried to Sea, and Landed at <HI>Hamborough,</HI> and &s;o carried up the <HI>Elb,</HI> as far as <HI>Drai&s;den,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxonie</HI>'s Court, and in tho&s;e Parts, it is &s;old for Six pence a Quart; and it is not like the Beer either for Ta&s;t, Strength, or Plea&s;ant|ne&s;s, as it was when here; the Sea having put it into a fermentation, cau&s;eth it to drink plea&s;ant, &s;trong, and delightful, even comparable to <HI>March</HI>-Beer in <HI>England</HI> four Years old, which is well-brewed, and grown very Mellow; Hundreds of Merchants can affirm what I &s;ay to be true. Now I will &s;hew you the rea&s;ons why the <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI>-Trade will come to <HI>Stratford</HI> in cour&s;e; and when I have Publi&s;hed the&s;e rea&s;ons now given in Print, the Trade of making Mum will begin in &s;ome &s;hort time to be &s;et forward there; and that River being a Brat of my Brain, when I contriv'd it, the Trade of making Mum there, was a thing I much hoped to &s;ee come to pa&s;s; and I believe it is now not far off. And therefore I beg that worthy Gentlemans leave, Sir <HI>John Clapton,</HI> that I may give Name unto a Town that will certainly ri&s;e and be built in about thirty Acres of his Land near <HI>Stratford-Bridg,</HI> wherein Granaries, Mum, and other <HI>Brew-hou&s;es</HI> will be built, as al&s;o &s;ome part of the Linnen-Trade there Manufactured: The place being &s;o conveniently &s;cituated, that Cuts may be made in the Land for Barges to come and go to each Back-&s;ide,
<PB N="120" REF="75">thereby to unlade all goods with ea&s;e, and little charge; And I name that Town, whereof &s;ome part is now built, New-<HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> for in <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> the Trade is Mum, Linnen, and Linnen-Yarn; and I hope to &s;ee before I die, as much Monies turned and wound in Mum, Linnen, Linnen-Yarn at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> near <HI>Stratford-Bridg,</HI> as is now at <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> Now I will demon&s;trate. and &s;hew you the rea&s;ons, and how ea&s;ie it is to bring the Mum-Trade to New-<HI>Brun&s;|wick.</HI> New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> lies at the Head of a Navigable River, and within twenty Miles round there is as good Wheat as any is in <HI>England</HI> (and I think the be&s;t), and always the cheape&s;t, the place is well &s;cituated for that purpo&s;e; and all materials are ready at hand. The Wheat in the&s;e Parts is a much better Corn, than is the VVheat at <HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> for the VVheat at <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> is a flat &s;mall VVheat, and thick Husked; the rea&s;on of that is, the Climate where it grows; the Sun is very hot in the two Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and &s;o the heat of the Sun doth not give it leave to fill and ripen kind|ly. Our VVheat is large, full-bre&s;ted, and thin-rined, and none in <HI>England</HI> to compare with the VVheat near <HI>Banbury,</HI> and upon the Hills thereabouts. Now at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> build <HI>Granaries,</HI> and take in VVheat when it is cheap, as it will be this Year: and write by the Copy of the <HI>Granaries</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and then the Mum-Brewers at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> will have the &s;ame advantage, nay, and much better than the Mum-Brewers have at Old <HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> for at New <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> there Granaries will be in the Town where they Brew, and better Corn, and at the Head of a Na|vigable River, to be tran&s;ported down to Sea, and &s;o for any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> without paying &s;o many Cu&s;toms
<PB N="121" REF="75">and Taxes, as doth Old-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> for their Mum. Al&s;o the Wheat is much better, and no Land-carriage for the commodity; and at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> are Coles to be had cheap and plentiful to maintain the Fire; whereas at Old-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> VVood is dear, and very charge|able.</P>
<P>From New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> Mum will be carried down the River <HI>Avon,</HI> into <HI>Severn,</HI> and &s;o into <HI>King-Road,</HI> and there Shipt for <HI>London:</HI> And the charge of carriadge will be but twenty Shillings <HI>Per</HI> Tun to <HI>London;</HI> from New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> will be &s;ent down va&s;t quantities of Mum, and &s;old to the Merchants of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and by them &s;ent and diffu&s;ed into all Parts; and then <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> will be unto New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> as <HI>Hamborough</HI> now is to Old-<HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> for Trade will go and creep into any part where it can be be&s;t and cheape&s;t done. And I &s;ay New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> con&s;idering all circum&s;tances, will make the Mum cheaper by four Shillings in the pound, than Old-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> can: But I know &s;ome will object, and &s;ay, that it hath been tried here &s;everal times to make Mum (and it will not be &s;o good as the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Mum): My an&s;wer is, That the Sea is the oc|ca&s;ion of its being &s;o good, it puts it to a &s;econd work|ing, or Fermentation, which is the ab&s;olute cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> will have a better advantage by Sea, than hath the Old; for the Mum being &s;ent down the River, and Shipt for <HI>London,</HI> and carried about the Lands-end, and &s;o up the Channel to <HI>London,</HI> will have much more tumbling at Sea; and be commonly thrice as long coming about for <HI>London,</HI> as they are coming from <HI>Hamborough</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> one Wind &s;erves from <HI>Hamborough</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> Five or Six &s;everal Winds will but &s;erve to fit a Ve&s;&s;el to come out of <HI>King-Road</HI> to
<PB N="122" REF="76"><HI>London.</HI> So you &s;ee New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> will have a better and more large pa&s;&s;age at Sea, than from <HI>Hamborough</HI> to <HI>London:</HI> and then all Mum &s;ent to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> will by the Merchants be &s;ent to Sea; and the Sea will give it the advantage of a Fermentation. And in the We&s;tern-Seas, it will do much more to benefit the Mum, than in the Ea&s;tern. In the Ea&s;tern-Seas, the Climate is cool un|til <HI>May;</HI> but in the We&s;tern-Seas the Climate is warm in <HI>March:</HI> and as the different heat of the Climate is &s;o the Liquor &s;hall ripen and grow quick and fit to drink: And in that particular, New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> will infinitely out-do Old-<HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> But if there be not Granaries built at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> to take in Wheat when cheap, and all other things well &s;etled, the benefit propo&s;ed, mu&s;t not be expected; for it mu&s;t be made of cheap Wheat, and &s;uch Wheat for a Stock mu&s;t be taken into the Granaries in a cheap time; and when it is cheap, at lea&s;t, three years Wheat Malted before|hand fit to make Mum. The older the Wheaten-Malt is for that purpo&s;e, the better it will be; and the more profit will be made of it. Now I leave this to the &s;e|rious con&s;ideration of that worthy Per&s;on Sir <HI>John Clap|ton,</HI> in who&s;e Lands New-<HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> will be built; As al|&s;o to Mr. <HI>Bri&s;hop,</HI> and my Friend the Town-Clerk of <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider what a great thing it will be to the Publique, and to the Countrey near <HI>Stratford,</HI> if the Linnen and Mum-Trade be &s;etled there. No part in <HI>Europe</HI> is comparable, as to &s;citua|tion, materials, and &s;oil to that place. And you may ob&s;erve me in my whole Di&s;cour&s;e now Printed, that I &s;hew you, that Trade will go to the place where it can be made cheape&s;t, and &s;oone&s;t at Market. For you may ob&s;erve my Maxim, Honour and Hone&s;ty
<PB N="123" REF="76">brings Riches: And the&s;e three bring Strength and Trade. So places made by Art convenient, as there is by <HI>Avon</HI> being made Navigable, gives the advantage to this great and rich de&s;ign of &s;etting forward the Mum and Linnen-Trade at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick.</HI> I pray ob&s;erve; before you had that River Navigable, you were lockt up in the <HI>Inlands,</HI> and could not come to any Navigable River under twenty Miles; And in all times when Corn was plenty, the ways being ve|ry deep in VVinter, and in &s;ome Summers it was there very cheap; whereby the Tenants could not pay Rents to the Landlords, and the Lands put to keep Sheep: So all improvements were wholly out of their Power. But &s;ee now how the ca&s;e is altered, by this new River coming to your Town. Now all Improvements offer them&s;elves to you; as the Mum-Trade, the Linnen, and Thred-Trade: Nay you will be to the We&s;t of <HI>England, Wales, Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> as <HI>Dantzick</HI> is to <HI>Po|land;</HI> you will &s;erve all tho&s;e Parts, when Corn is wanting; you have the advantage of your Navigable River to &s;end down your Corn, and &s;o by the help of <HI>Severn</HI> it will be carried into all Parts that &s;tand in need thereof.</P>
<P>At New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> Granaries may be built for the holding of Corn, and there to be &s;tored up, as in <HI>Ger|many;</HI> and there all things being done by the &s;ame way, method, rule, and order, as it is at <HI>Marenburgh,</HI> all the Countrey-round for Thirty Miles, will have many and great advantages; and to the Publick, no Tongue can expre&s;s the &s;everal and &s;trange benefits it will ad|mini&s;ter: As fir&s;t, It will pre&s;erve the Corn from Rats and Mice, and what was formerly de&s;troyed by them, now will be kept to feed the Poor. Secondly, It gives the
<PB N="124" REF="77">Husbandman a great advantage; for he may Thra&s;h out his Corn, and carry it to be kept &s;afe in the Granaries until he hath occa&s;ion to &s;ell it, and &s;o the Con&s;umption occa&s;ioned by Rats and Mice is wholly prevented; and that which fed Rats and Mice, and other Vermine, and which other accidents de&s;troyed, will be pre&s;erved and kept to feed the Poor; which is at lea&s;t the third part of the Wheat of <HI>England,</HI> if kept Four years in Ricks, Stacks, Barns, Hou&s;es, and Lofts: Al&s;o the Husband|man will, by having a place always ready to lay up his Corn &s;afe, have the benefit of his Straw to feed his Cat|tel, and make Muck, Chaff for his Hor&s;es, and light Corn for his Pigs and Poultry, and his Husbandry will be in a regular motion, and an&s;wer his ju&s;t and labori|ous ends; whereas if his Corn be Rickt up Three or Four years, his Husbandry is out of order, &s;ometimes nothing for his &s;ervants to do, his Pigs half fami&s;hed, his Cattel lean, want of Muck that this Straw &s;hould produce to bring his Husbandry about as it ought to be done; The poor Farmer, nay, Free-holder looks upon his Ricks with &s;ighs and a heavy heart, he &s;eeth there are Vermin in them, which are not to be prevented; &s;ome owe Moneys upon Intere&s;t, &s;ome to their Land|lords, but Men will not &s;tay long; the Tenant prays patience, Time is given, but &s;till a Plenty is continued, and the Ricks not pulled down; but at la&s;t neither U&s;er|er, nor Landlord will &s;tay longer: Then the Lawyer is &s;et at work, Suits are brought, and there is no &s;tand|ing, but trouble, and mi&s;ery, all ruined; and into Pri|&s;on he mu&s;t, if the Moneys be not paid immediately; and a large and long Lawyers Bill into the bargain.</P>
<P>I pray, where is now the poor Farmer, and many Free-holders al&s;o? what mu&s;t they do? what &s;hift mu&s;t
<PB N="125" REF="77">they make? Shall they fly to the Kings-Bench, or run away? &s;omething mu&s;t be done: I tell thee what, im|mediately pull down their Ricks, and Thra&s;h without doors and within, as fa&s;t as they can &s;end the Corn to Market, although never &s;o cheap, and the doing there|of at that time never &s;o much to their damage; and at Market, part of the Moneys made of this Corn, paid for charges at Law; great part of the Corn before the Ricks were pulled down, eaten and con&s;umed by Rats and Mice. Now ob&s;erve the con&s;equences of the&s;e things: The poor hone&s;t Laborious Countrey-man being thus pur&s;ued by Suits in Law, Rats and Mice devouring his Corn when in Ricks, and &s;old cheap, and at un&s;ea|&s;onable times; Servants &s;eeing his nece&s;&s;ity, rai&s;e price of their Labours: This for&s;tha&s;t puts his Teams to carry his Corn to Market, and that cau&s;eth the neglect of that years Husbandry; and truly the end of all this is, no more than this; The Lawyer is paid his Bill, for he will, or el&s;e no Team nor Ma&s;ter neither mu&s;t come to Market; the Servants wages paid that Thra&s;hed out the Corn; the U&s;erer paid what the Farmer owes him; but you will &s;ay, what &s;hall the Landlord have? I will tell you what, he will be &s;ure of his Farm thrown upon his hands, and that pre&s;ent years profit lo&s;t; nay, and when he comes to &s;tock it him&s;elf, he may po&s;&s;ibly lo&s;e his Rent, and the intere&s;t of his &s;tock put upon the Land; and when he &s;ets it again, lo&s;e Twenty in the Hundred, and glad to get a Tenant to take it &s;o: But that which is wor&s;e, The Tenant and Landlord are then in the wor&s;t condition, and their Families and E&s;tates out of order. Moneys is mo&s;t wanting, and Trade mo&s;t dead in times when Corn is very cheap; and the Rea|&s;on is, That the Corn lies in Ricks, and no Man can, or
<PB N="126" REF="78">is benefited or &s;ecured by it; only there is a merry Fea&s;t for Rats and Mice: And if it hold cheap for Three or Four years, the Tenant lays the Key under the Door, and then the Wolf is knawing a hole in at the Land|lords Door; I am &s;ure his head is in already, therefore I &s;ay, timely prevent him from getting in his body: For after death there is no redemption.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Landlord &s;eeing his Tenant in this way, &s;ending his Corn into the Publick Bank-Granary, and there lodging it, will know the quantities, which mu&s;t be affixt, and &s;et up in a Catalogue in &s;ome place of the Granary, thereby to be viewed and taken notice by any that think they are, or may be concerned therein; and &s;uch Corn being in Granary, the Tenant may tran&s;|fer it to the Landlord, or any part thereof; and &s;o the Landlord will always be in &s;uch a condition, as to pre|&s;erve him&s;elf, and to prevent his Farms being thrown upon his hands; for if the Landlord feeth his Tenant a good Husband, and doth the be&s;t he can to live, then he will forbear, and give him time, and no danger, be|cau&s;e he is able to give his Landlord Bank-Credit in Corn for his Rent; and &s;o the Corn is kept and pre&s;er|ved for a good Market, and at la&s;t the Landlord paid all his Rent, and the Tenant enabled to maintain his Fa|mily, and to Husband his Farm to the be&s;t advantage: And I think here is no harm done, unle&s;s the prevention of Law-Suits, and the mi&s;eries attending them, and cheat|ing the Rats and Mice of their large fea&s;ts, that la&s;t com|monly Three or Four years, be inju&s;tice; be&s;ides the Landlord hath his advantage clearly before him, he may fee at all times the condition of his Tenant; for if he will not come to the Publique <HI>Granary</HI> with his Corn, whereby the Landlord may be &s;ecured upon the Ticket
<PB N="127" REF="78">thereof for his Rent, but keep it to make the Rats and Mice fea&s;ts; then he may Command pre&s;ent payment of his Rents, or take a new Tenant: But I believe many Gentlemen, and others, will after reading of my Book twice over, &s;ee it &s;o much their Intere&s;t to have Publique Granaries, that they will be upon building &s;ome in many places in <HI>England,</HI> before any Law pa&s;&s;es to put them into a po&s;ture: and ob&s;erve, when this Corn is in the Publique-bank-Granary in the Countrey, im|mediately it is to be Regi&s;tred at the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> in <HI>Lon|don.</HI> So it will be immediately good credit to inliven Trade, and fetch out all Moneys now unimploy'd, and prevent Law, and the trouble of attending it: The Tenant, Landlord, and Trade will have their ends an|&s;wered; and there is no way under Heaven at pre&s;ent to inliven Trade, pre&s;erve Landlord and Tenant, and bring the unimploy'd Moneys out, but this way.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Corn being lodged &s;afe, and kept in the Publique Granary, will be the occa&s;ion immediate|ly of fetching out, and bringing forth mo&s;t of the Ca&s;h of <HI>England,</HI> now wholly unimploy'd. All people near the Publique-bank-Granaries will immediately be deal|ing to have &s;ome Corn in Bank-credit, for that cannot mi&s;s of finding an increa&s;e and benefit to them in the Ri&s;e of Corn. There will al&s;o tumble into the Publique-bank for Corn, all the Moneys round the Countrey, now in the Servants hands, both Men and Maids (which at pre&s;ent lies dead in their Che&s;ts); and then <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> will make a merry bout when Corn ri&s;es, prai&s;e and pray for the Man that brought the Publique bank to New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and drink his Health in Burnt-Clarret: In <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> it is thus with all Servants. And there is no way that mortal man can
<PB N="128" REF="79">invent to fetch the unimploy'd Moneys into Trade with &s;peed, but this only way. The Titles of Land now are &s;o uncertain, and per&s;onal &s;ecurity &s;o bad, Moneys will grow &s;carcer, and &s;carcer, and Trade deader, and deader: and our Neighbours beyond the Seas, are &s;o linkt and fa&s;tned with our Merchants here, that the poor Countrey people, and Landlords al&s;o, &s;hall be but Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water, unle&s;s by this way relieved. Con&s;ider, Into this Corn-bank will be laid all the Moneys of all poor labour|ing people, who keep no Teems; for here is their great advantage, they laying by Corn when cheap, in the Granary, there kept &s;afe, &s;weet, and good; it's po&s;&s;i|ble, and very probable, the&s;e poor men, nor their fa|milies, never eat dear Bread after in all their lives; &s;o here will be no poor in the Pari&s;h, nor complaining in the Streets for Bread: And as I formerly &s;aid, here is no harm done, but cheating the Rats and Mice.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Con&s;ider, Corn being lodged in cheap times in the&s;e Publique Granaries of New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> will cau&s;e the Linnen and Thred-Trade upon a &s;udden to come to perfection; for there will be Bread and Drink always cheap; and that being &s;o, there is &s;ufficient in|couragement for men to venture upon any new Trade; But if Victuals, as Bread and Drink, prove dear, and uncertain in its Rates and Pri&s;es; from thence Trade will depart, and find out &s;ome place that &s;hall fit and plea&s;e her better: For as Honour, and Hone&s;ty, brings Riches, and Strength, &s;o cheap Victuals, and good, with all things nece&s;&s;ary and cheap, to be imployed in the Manufacture, will thereby be the occa&s;ion of &s;trength|ning of the place, and making of it Rich, and cau&s;e Trade in proce&s;s of time to leave the place where
<PB N="129" REF="79">&s;he was formerly, and come where &s;he may be better entertained, and more advantageou&s;ly accommodated: I find that Mi&s;tris called Trade, will bow and bend to every ju&s;t and good thing, wherein &s;he may be pre&s;er|ved, and not in danger to be fami&s;hed; and therefore I have provided her good Granaries to hold her food, which is good Wheat and Malt, to make her Bread and Drink; I have al&s;o given order for the preparing of good Flax, to make her fine Linnen; I have provided her a fit place, with good Merchants, to make that de|lightful Liquor called Mum; I have al&s;o provided her a Navigable River, with Cuts to be made to her Back|&s;ides, &s;o that Barges may carry and re-carry her Goods and Riches up and down, to Sea, and from Sea; I have travelled to <HI>Magdenburgh,</HI> to &s;ee to fit her with Grana|ries, as good, if not better than there is; I have travel|led to <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> to find a way to fit her with her de|d&s;ires, as to good Mum; I have travelled into <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> to &s;ee her fine-&s;pun Threds, Wheels and Looms, that &s;o &s;he may want nothing; I have travelled into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> to &s;ee her Weaving and White|ing, with all its advantages. And now dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, I certainly mu&s;t court thee in thy flight, to fall down into New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> near <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> and into New-<HI>Harlem</HI> in the Mannor of <HI>Anilcot;</HI> and there thou &s;halt be attended with the Riches of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> as to Mum; as al&s;o with the Riches of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> as to Corn; thou &s;halt al&s;o be attended with the Riches of <HI>Saxony,</HI> as to Flax and fine Threds: And to compleat all, thou &s;halt have on the Back&s;ide of thy Towns, pla|ces to Bleach and Whiten thy fine Linnen, being the Lands of the Earl of <HI>Middle&s;ex;</HI> equal to <HI>Harlem</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> for all conveniences, if not better.</P>
<PB N="130" REF="80">
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> I call all tho&s;e People to be Judges, who have great quantities of Corn, and are forced to keep it Two or Three years in Ricks, whether it lo&s;eth not at lea&s;t one fourth part of the Corn by Vermin, Rats, Mice, and other accidents: and if kept Four or Five years, many times the one half is con&s;umed; be&s;ides the mi&s;eries before &s;poken of, that attend the Landlord, Tenant, and Creditor. Now this Publick Granary is the cau&s;e of pre&s;erving all this Corn, that otherwi&s;e would have been con&s;umed by Rats and Mice; and as I &s;aid in my Book, That we may beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> without fighting, now I &s;ay, and affirm, That all the poor Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> will be fed with Bread &s;ufficient, with|out being chargeable to the Publick for any thing: For they have the Corn to &s;upply them for Bread, which the Rats and Mice did de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Now Reader, I pray thee &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, whether the Seed of a Voluntary Regi&s;ter, is not convenient to be with all &s;peed &s;owed upon this &s;urfeited <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Field; all People that know any thing, know that Seed long &s;owed on the &s;ame Land over and over, brings the Farmer at la&s;t to Beggery; I que&s;tion not, but thou art convinc'd this Publick Granary well ordered, with the Corn put into it, will feed all the poor People of <HI>England,</HI> taking nothing but what would be eat and de&s;troyed by Rats, Mice, and other accidents: All you that Read this, con&s;ider what cheap Victuals, and certain, will do to mo&s;t Manufactures; and the cheapne&s;s, will pre|&s;erve it with us: So here is good Corn and cheap, and much Plenty; here is excellent good Land to bear Flax, and great quantities of it; here a covenient place may be made to draw Water out of <HI>Avon</HI> River, to &s;upply the Bleaching and Whiting: Here is at pre&s;ent, no &s;et|tled
<PB N="131" REF="81">Trade, or Manufacture, nor any &s;ettled within Fif|teen Miles of the place; here you are in an excellent plentiful Countrey of Fle&s;h, and all other provi&s;ions; but that which crowns the de&s;ign, you are at the Head of a Navigable River, by which you will have with ea&s;e and cheapne&s;s, all the Flax, Cloth, Thred, Tape, and other things, &s;ent down the River <HI>Avon</HI> into <HI>Severn,</HI> and &s;o for Sea, <HI>Bri&s;tol, Wales, Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and many other places; and all things you &s;tand in need of will be brought up the River <HI>Avon,</HI> to New-<HI>Brun&s;wick:</HI> And I &s;ay, God and Nature, with the River <HI>Avon</HI> being made Naviga|ble, hath &s;o &s;trangely accommodated New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and New-<HI>Harlem,</HI> and fitted it for this Linnen, nay, I &s;ay, fine Linnen Trade; that certainly, no part in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> can compare with it.</P>
<P>As to the Third, That which is to be the Publick Granary to keep the Corn for all Gentlemen, Mer|chants, and Farmers that plea&s;e to &s;end it thither, that &s;o the de&s;truction and damages occa&s;ioned by Rats and Mice may be prevented; I &s;ay, in this Granary, Corn at all times &s;hall be taken in, from all per&s;ons that plea&s;e to &s;end it; and the Corn &s;o &s;ent; mu&s;t be pre&s;erved &s;weet, &s;afe, and in good order, for one Peny the Bu&s;hel for a whole year, and the owner at liberty to take it out at his own will and plea&s;ure; or to &s;ell, transfer, or a&s;&s;ign any part of the &s;aid Corn to any Per&s;on or Per|&s;ons, for the payment of his Debts, or in Mortgage to pay his Landlord his Rent; and the Granary-keepers to give good &s;ecurity, that all things &s;hould be faithfully done and di&s;charged. Now the Corn being brought into the Publick Granary, and there Regi&s;tred in the Regi&s;ter Book, to be kept for that purpo&s;e; and the Per&s;on that hath put in the &s;aid Corn, taking a Note
<PB N="132" REF="82">under the Hand and Seal from the Granary-Regi&s;ter, of the quantity of Corn brought into the Granary, with the time it was delivered, with the Matter and kind of the Corn; Then the&s;e advantages will en&s;ue.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Farmer will have all the advantages I &s;poke of before, as pre&s;ervation from Rats and Mice, Straw to &s;upply his Cattel, the Chaff for his Hor&s;es; and the light Corn to feed his Pigs and Poultry, and the Muck|hill in a regular con&s;tant quantity; his Husbandry Ma|naged with rule and order to his advantage, no forc't-ha&s;t; but Thra&s;hing, and carrying the Corn to the Gra|nary in times wherein his Servants have lea&s;ure; &s;o in Seeding-time, and Harve&s;t, all People are freed for that, and only that imploy: The Corn being in the Granary, prevents the mi&s;ery of Law, and the charge attending it; the Landlord &s;ecured his Rent, or part thereof, by receiving a Ticket from the Granary-Regi&s;ter, of a cer|tain quantity of Corn there lodged, the property being Transferred from the Tenant to the Landlord, and entred in the Regi&s;ter; this Corn in Granary gives the Tenant Credit to take up Moneys to furni&s;h his occa&s;ions, &s;o as he may manage his affairs, and Hus|band his Land to the be&s;t advantage, and prevent the &s;ad effects that commonly attends the want of pre&s;ent Moneys for his nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions; and for want of Credit, many times the laborious hone&s;t Countrey Farmer is undone, and forc't to come and live upon the Pari&s;h; and the Land he was Tenant to mu&s;t now help to maintain him; whereas, if prevention had been time|ly found out, again&s;t the Rats with Two Legs, that &s;o charge of Law-Suits had been prevented, the Corn kept &s;afe in a Granary, and pre&s;erved from the Rats and Mice with Four Legs, then the Landlord had been paid
<PB N="133" REF="82">his Rents, the Tenant pre&s;erved, the U&s;erer paid, the charge and trouble of Law avoided, and all mi&s;eries now upon Landlord, Tenant, and Creditor, not &s;o much as heard of: And for that all the&s;e &s;ort of Mi&s;e|ries may for the future be prevented, and &s;ufficient means and remedies pre&s;cribed for the doing thereof; I &s;hall here give you the ways, means, rules, orders, methods, directions, and policies, whereby they cer|tainly will be with ea&s;e accompli&s;hed; for they are ex|actly &s;o done in <HI>Germany,</HI> and have mo&s;t &s;trange ad|vantages in the&s;e parts, in the advance of Trade, and procuring of Riches: And it will be with us (if once ac|compli&s;hed) as if one were rai&s;ed from the dead.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e, and hope to &s;ee Three large Granaries built at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> one whereof to be appropri|ated to the Per&s;ons that &s;et up Brewing of Mum, one to be appropriated to, and for the keeping of Corn for a &s;tock for the poor of the Countrey, and for to &s;up|ply the People that work in the Linnen Manufacture; and one to be a publick Granary for all Gentlemen and Farmers to &s;end their Corn into, when Thra&s;hed, to prevent the de&s;truction which is made by Rats and Mice, when it is in Ricks, Barns, Chambers and Lofts. And of the advantage that the&s;e Granaries will be, I will &s;peak particluarly.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Granary built to take in Corn for the u&s;e of the Brewers of Mum, will be the life of that Trade; and without &s;uch Granaries, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et on that Trade: For Corn mu&s;t be bought in &s;uch times as this year is, it being not only now very good, but cheap al&s;o; and in a cheap year they may take in Four or Five years Stock, as they do at <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> and <HI>Shenibank:</HI> Then &s;uppo&s;e the Wheat now co&s;t two
<PB N="134" REF="83">Shillings Four-pence the Bu&s;hel at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and that be kept Four years in the Granary at Two-pence the Bu&s;hel for Granary Rent; then the Corn will lye the Mum-Brewers in Two Shillings Six-pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel, and that is cheaper than it is &s;old in any time at Old-<HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> and it is &s;eldom, but once in Four years, there is a plentiful year of Corn in <HI>England,</HI> and in this year the Brewers may &s;upply their Granaries again: And as I &s;aid before, here is cheap Corn, good Corn, and a multitude of it, the place of Trade fixt at the Head of a Navigable River, good and cheap Fuel to be made u&s;e of, with a quick pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies, Ireland, Mediteranian, Spain, France, Holland,</HI> and a large pa&s;&s;age at Sea to bring it to <HI>London,</HI> to help and make the Mum good, by putting it into a &s;econd fermentation: And I &s;ay, here this Trade of making Mum may be fixt with very great advantage; and if once well fixt, from thence it cannot depart, no place in <HI>England</HI> being of that advantage to an&s;wer all the ends, as this place is.</P>
<P>The Second Granary, which is to be &s;upplyed by the Country with Corn, and there to be kept &s;afe for the benefit of tho&s;e that work in the County in the Lin|nen-Manufacture, and to &s;upply the Poor when a dearth comes; Corn will be kept Four years in the Granaries, and the Rate then will be but Two Shillings Six-pence the Bu&s;hel; and with this cheap Corn the People will be &s;upplyed with Bread, whereby they will make and perfect the intended Linnen-Manufacture very cheap; and this con&s;tancy of Bread, and at cheap rates, will certainly be a great and certain means of fixing the fine Linnen Trade at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and New-<HI>Harlem:</HI> And the Rea&s;ons are the&s;e, near the very Place are great
<PB N="135" REF="83">quantities of Land excellent good to bear Flax, and ve|ry good places may with a little art, be made by the Town-&s;ides to Whiten and Bleach Linnens; and within one Mile of New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> there is the Mannor of <HI>Milcot,</HI> being the Lands of the Earl of <HI>Midd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="5 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">|on which Mannor there will be &s;ufficient Fla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span">, to imploy Ten thou&s;and People to work it into Manu|facture: And there are in the&s;e Lands, by the River <HI>Avon</HI> &s;ide, convenient places to make Bleaching<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> and near <HI>Milcot</HI>-Hou&s;e very plain good Land to build a Ci|ty for the fine Linnen Trade, with good places to &s;et up Engines to Weave Tape, to go by Water.

<P>Now I will demon&s;trate and &s;hew you the length, breadth, and height the Granaries ought to be of, to hold this Corn, as al&s;o the charge of building one of them at New-<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> being the Land of Sir <HI>John Clapton;</HI> as al&s;o I will demon&s;trate the way how it &s;hould be built for the be&s;t advantage, with the way of ordering and managing the Corn, that it may keep good, &s;weet, and clean, Eight or Ten years. The Gra|naries mu&s;t be Three hundred foot long, Eighteen foot wide betwixt in&s;ide and in&s;ide Seven &s;tories high, each Story Seven foot high, all to be built of good, well-burnt Brick, and laid in Lime and Sand very well; the ends of the Granaries mu&s;t be &s;et North and South, &s;o the &s;ides will then be Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and in the &s;ides of the Granaries there mu&s;t be large Windows to open and &s;hut clo&s;e, that when the Wind blows at We&s;t, the Windows may be laid open, and then the Granary-Man will be turning and winding the Corn, and all filth and

<P>The charge of one Granary Three hundred foot long, Eighteen foot wide, Seven Stories high, Seven foot be|twixt each Story, being built with Brick at New-<HI>Brun&s;|wick,</HI> or New-<HI>Harlem,</HI> in the Mannor of <HI>Milcot:</HI> Six hundred thou&s;and of Bricks builds a Granary, Two Brick and half thick the Two fir&s;t Stories, Two Brick thick the Three next Stories, Brick and half thick the Two uppermo&s;t Stories; and the Brick will be made and

<P>Serious Reader, Here is a way plainly lined out to cheat the Rats and Mice, to feed the Poor, to pre&s;erve the Tenant, to pay the Landlord, to bring to us &s;eve|ral Manufactures, to prevent Law-Suits, to fetch out all Moneys now unimployed into Trade; and it will be, if done, as the Blood in the Body, it will &s;o circulate in a few years, that Corn will be to <HI>England</HI> better than ready Moneys; and to have this &s;o, is undoubtedly e|very Mans intere&s;t in the Kingdom: Therefore Corn Regi&s;tred in the Publick Granary in each Countrey, and &s;o entred in the general Regi&s;ter at the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> will bring to pa&s;s the&s;e things now Treated of, and ma|ny more mo&s;t &s;trange advantages to the People of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> which you may expect in the Second Part.</P>

<P><HI>Twelfthly,</HI> Con&s;ider, of what &s;ad con&s;equence it is
<PB N="141" REF="86">with us in <HI>England</HI> at this day, that we cannot have Bonds and Bills Transferred by A&s;&s;ignments, &s;o as the Property may go a-long with the A&s;&s;ignment; thereby one Bond or Bill, will go in the nature of Bills of Ex|change: And &s;o <HI>A.</HI> owing Two hundred pounds to <HI>B.</HI> he A&s;&s;igns him the Bond of <HI>C.</HI> who owed him Two hun|dred pounds, and <HI>C.</HI> owing <HI>D.</HI> Two hundred pounds, A&s;&s;igns him the Bond of <HI>E.</HI> who owed him Two hun|dred pounds; and &s;o one Bond or Bill, would go through Twenty hands, and thereby be as ready Mo|neys, and do much to the benefit of Trade, and pre|vent infinite vexatious Suits, and prevent the ruin of &s;ome hundreds of Families: For as the Law now is practi&s;ed at this day, although the word A&s;&s;ign be in the Bond, yet the Property of the Bond pa&s;&s;es not; but the party A&s;&s;igning, his Heirs, Executors or Admi|ni&s;trators may di&s;charge the Bond by a Relea&s;e. And pray ob&s;erve the mi&s;erable calamity that the poor Peo|ple lye under for want of this being not done; now <HI>A.</HI> owes <HI>B.</HI> Two hundred pounds, the Bond being Four hundred pounds, for the payment of Two hun|dred pounds. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ends a Writ into the Countrey, and arre&s;ts <HI>A.</HI> he cannot get &s;uch Bayle as the Sherif will accept: So perhaps lieth a Month or longer in Pri&s;on, his Wives heart almo&s;t broke, Children and Friends &s;orrowful; At la&s;t the Wife importunes Friends of hers to be bound for his appearance; but he cannot get &s;pecial Bayle above; then the Attorneys and Sherifs harve&s;t comes in; they pre&s;ently make three Suits of one, and fall on the poor Security. At la&s;t Bayle is put in above; then Common-Law-Tryals, Demurrers, Writs of Error, Chancery. So Plantif and Defendant many times ruine one the other. Whereas if a
<PB N="142" REF="87">Bond were Transferable, and the property to pa&s;s it, be|ing a Bond, and good Men bound in it; this Bond would run from Man to Man, from Hand to Hand, from one Trade&s;man to another; and &s;o one Bond would pay twenty Men; for people at this day would be glad to have payments made them in &s;uch Paper ra|ther than go to Law for their own; and often undo their Creditor, and &s;ometimes them&s;elves to. It would be a mighty benefit to Trade and Commerce to have Bonds transfer'd. A poor man in <HI>England</HI> that hath a Thou&s;and pounds in Bonds with good Sureties bound, cannot pay one hundred pounds of his Debts with them. Our Free-lands being put under a Voluntary Regi&s;ter, and the property of Bonds being made Transferable by a&s;&s;ignment, will be a great profit to the Nation.</P>
<P>As things are now, we have not one fourth part of Moneys &s;ufficient to drive the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;et up the neglected Fi&s;hery, improve our own Ma|nufactures, and to an&s;wer peoples ju&s;t, hone&s;t, and lawful occa&s;ions. But if the Free-lands were Regi|&s;tred, and Bonds Transferable, then we &s;hould have three parts in four more Ca&s;h than we &s;hould have occa&s;ion to u&s;e: For the Land Regi&s;tred, will do what Money now doth; and this is credit equal to Moneys; and then we &s;hall do what the <HI>D&V;TCH</HI> now do, never want Moneys to do any great thing. But we mu&s;t &s;ubmit our &s;elves in all things to his Ma|je&s;ties Gracious Plea&s;ure and Authority.</P>
<P><HI>Twelfthly,</HI> It will by its credit, be the cau&s;e of &s;et|ting at work all the poor of <HI>England</HI> in the Linnen and Iron-Manufacture, and &s;o convenience the Woollen-Ma|nufacture, that it will be as one that were ri&s;en from the dead.</P>
<PB N="143" REF="87">
<P><HI>Thirteenthly,</HI> Con&s;ider, That the want of a Regi&s;ter will make us in few years like unto a Wheat-rick, that hath &s;tood many years; when it is opened, all the Corn is con&s;umed by Rats and Mice, and nothing left but the Straw and Clothings.</P>

<P N="1">1. COn&s;ider what quantities of fine Linnens are made in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> and here worn and con&s;umed, and how many hands it imploys in work to manufacture it, and the great benefit the <HI>Dutch</HI> gain, being the great Ma&s;ters of that Trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, that if the&s;e fine Clothes were made here, how it would imploy the Poor, rai&s;e the price of Land, and keep our Moneys at home; for the <HI>Dutch</HI> take nothing from us in exchange, wherein the benefit is any way con&s;iderable to the publick.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, of all cour&s;e Linnens brought from <HI>France,</HI> as Canva&s;es, Lockrums, and great quantities of coar&s;e Clothes, which have of late years &s;o crouded upon us, that it hath almo&s;t laid a&s;ide the making of Linnen Cloth in <HI>England,</HI> and thereby the people are unimploy'd, and the Land lyeth idle and wa&s;te.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, the <HI>French</HI> take nothing of any value from us, but it is ready money for their Linnens; &s;o we keep their people at work, and &s;end them our moneys to pay them for it, and our own Poor are unimploy'd: But if a Tax were laid upon their coar&s;e Linnen Clothes, then what is brought out of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> would be made here of our own growth, to the Nations great enriching.</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider the Twine and Yarn ready wrought
<PB N="145" REF="88">and brought out of the Ea&s;t-Country to make Sail-Cloth and Cordage, which hath taken off the labour of multitude of people in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and thereabouts, and hath &s;o le&s;&s;ened that Trade, that it is almo&s;t lo&s;t: But if a Tax were laid upon the threds brought over ready wrought, then the labour of all &s;uch things would be here to &s;upply our Poor at work, and rai&s;e the price of our Lands.</P>
<P N="6">6. Con&s;ider what va&s;t quantities of narrow coar&s;e Clothes come out of <HI>Germany</HI> down the <HI>Elbe, We&s;er,</HI> and <HI>Emes,</HI> and tran&s;ported into <HI>England,</HI> and here vented and worn; the cheapne&s;s whereof hath beaten out the Linnen Trade formerly made in <HI>Lanca&s;hire, Che|&s;hire,</HI> and thereabouts, and carried and &s;old at <HI>London,</HI> (about forty years &s;ince it was a very great Trade, and tended much to the relief of the Poor in them parts:) A Tax being laid upon the&s;e Ea&s;terling Clothes, would occa&s;ion the reviving of that coar&s;e Cloth-Trade again with us, which would &s;et multitudes at work.</P>
<P N="7">7.

<P N="8">8. Con&s;ider the va&s;t and infinite quantities of Thred ready &s;pun, that comes down out of <HI>Germany</HI> into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and here made u&s;e of, and all the labour of &s;uch Threds are there done, the Government and People there have the advantage of it, and here we make u&s;e of them in many of our Commodities: It is of late
<PB N="146" REF="89">di&s;covered, that the cheapne&s;s of the&s;e Threds will eat out the very Spinning in mo&s;t parts of <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;Con|&s;ider, and take this pre&s;ident at <HI>Kidderminster</HI> in <HI>Wor|cester&s;hire;</HI> Formerly the Clothiers made u&s;e of Linnen-Yarn Spun in that Countrey to make their Lyn&s;ey-wool|&s;eys; but now the cheapne&s;s of the Foreign Threds hath put them upon making u&s;e of <HI>Germany</HI>-Yarn; in which Town there is One hundred pound a Week in Yarn made u&s;e of; great quantities of Thred al&s;o are u&s;ed at <HI>Manchester; Maidstone,</HI> and in other parts of <HI>England</HI> to mix with Woollen, with infinite other Commodities, and all the benefit of the labour of the&s;e Threds, is ap|plied to Foreigners; a Tax being put upon the Threds, would put the Wheel to work in <HI>England</HI> again. This is of great con&s;equence to the Publick, to be taken into con&s;ideration; for in this very thing of Spun-yarn, no le&s;s than Thirty thou&s;and People would be here em|ployed, if by Law it were encouraged.</P>

<HEAD>Con&s;iderations upon the Iron Manufacture.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. COn&s;ider, That the be&s;t Iron in the known World, is in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean,</HI> and in the Clay-Hill in <HI>Shrop&s;hire;</HI> and the Iron made of the&s;e mi|nerals, will work mo&s;t ea&s;ie&s;t and quicke&s;t into Commo|dities, of any Iron; and at pre&s;ent let there be one Tun of this Bar-Iron made of Fore&s;t-Iron-Stone, and one Tun of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Iron delivered to a Smith to work into Sythes, Sickles, and other Commodities; he will work the Fore&s;t-Iron, and give Twenty pounds the Tun for it; but will not give Twenty &s;hillings for the Tun of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Iron to work into Commodities: The Fore&s;t-Iron works ea&s;ie, plyable, and &s;oft; the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> works tough, churli&s;h and dogged.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, If there be not timely cour&s;e taken by the Parliament, to provide for the inclo&s;ure of the Commons in the&s;e parts, which lye convenient to the&s;e Iron Mines and Works, to encrea&s;e Woods; in a very &s;mall time, the Manufacture will be much le&s;&s;ened, and will prove the great impoveri&s;hing of the Countreys where now they are, and of much damage to the King|dom in general.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, that in <HI>Worcester&s;hire, Stafford</HI> and <HI>Darby&s;hire,</HI> there are great Mines of Iron-&s;tone that makes Iron, not very good for u&s;e for all things; but of excellent u&s;e for Nails, and many &s;mall Commodities: The benefit of which Trade, is of great advantage to all the Countrey round about. And in the&s;e Countreys there are great quantities of Pit-Coals, which are in all
<PB N="148" REF="90">places near the Iron-works, and by the help of the Coal the Iron is Manufactured with ea&s;e, cheapne&s;s and ad|vantage; whereby we have the Trade of good part of <HI>Europe</HI> for the&s;e Commodities: And &s;o &s;et infinite of poor People to work.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, the Woods in the&s;e parts decay and look thin, and will not la&s;t long, and when gone, the Iron-Stone and Coles will be there of no value, the People unimployed, the Trade lo&s;t; therefore the va&s;t Commons in the&s;e parts inclo&s;ed for Woods, would pre|vent all: As the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> hath done near <HI>Ana|burgh,</HI> and <HI>Sneburgh,</HI> where this politick pre&s;ervation of Woods, in Lands joyning to his Iron, Tin, Silver, and Copper-Mines, hath made them a very great branch of his Revenue; and all the Countrey round about, by the multitude of People imployed, are become very Rich; and there things in point of convenience, as to Iron-works, Tin-works, with Mines and Woods to &s;upply the works, are &s;o ordered, that there are at pre&s;ent Manufactured many Commodities in Iron, and &s;ent into <HI>England:</HI> If the&s;e Woods had not been pre|&s;erved by a politick Law, all his Mines had been no|thing worth, and the Iron Trade and Works would have continued near <HI>Newringburgh,</HI> from whence they now are departed; and that great benefit is now wholly enjoyed by the Duke of <HI>Saxony.</HI> The like it will do in few years, if the Commons are not inclo&s;ed; for Woods in the Countreys I name, where there is Iron-Stone, and Pit-Cole plentiful, are as the Brea&s;t is to the Child; let that cea&s;e, all dies.</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider, A Tax being laid upon barr Iron, and wrought Iron, will encrea&s;e the Iron Manufacture here, whereby the Prices of VVoods will be encrea&s;ed, the
<PB N="149" REF="90">Lands ri&s;e price, and the Poor imployed, and all Ma|terials both Mine, Pit-Cole and VVoods, are of our own growth and product.</P>
<P N="6">6. Con&s;ider how many Iron-Works are laid down, both in <HI>Kent, Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> and many more mu&s;t follow; The Rea&s;on is, the Iron from <HI>Sweadland, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> comes in &s;o cheap, that it cannot be made to profit here; and ob&s;erve how the Gentle|men and others in the Countreys, for want of Moneys for their Woods, are forced to Stock up their Copices, and turn them into Tillage and Pa&s;ture, the People unimployed, and their Lands fall Rents: To prevent all, a Tax upon Foreign Iron is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>Con&s;iderations upon Bank-Granaries.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. COn&s;ider, that the Corn carried into Bank-Granaries, and there kept &s;afe for &s;everal years; for one penny a year, for each Bu&s;hel, will be for Landlord and Tenant of great benefit: the Land|lord in all likelihood hath his Rent then &s;ecured, the Tenant his credit pre&s;erved, the Husbandry in a good and Regular way.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, the Landlord may at any time have mo|neys upon Bank-Corn, transferred from his Tenant to him for Rent; and thereby inable the Landlord upon that Credit, to take up moneys at all times to an&s;wer his ju&s;t occa&s;ions: and the Corn being Regi&s;tred in the County, and al&s;o at the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> in London, will in|finitely enliven Trade; and Bills for Corn in Banks will be as good as ready moneys, and thereby prevent in|finite of mi&s;chiefs that attend want of pre&s;ent mo|neys.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, that Bank-Granaries will prevent the poor peoples mi&s;eries, for want of food, in &s;ome wet and un&s;ea&s;onable years; and will be the occa&s;ion of tak|ing infinite poor people off the Pari&s;h, and prevent others falling upon the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, it is the true intere&s;t of all Gentlemen that have many Tenants in great Corn-Countreys, to build Granaries upon their charges, and take in their own Tenants and Neighbours Corn, and receive from them payment for keeping thereof: And if this comes to be put in practice by the Gentlemen, the next thing
<PB N="151" REF="91">they will then be at, Is to &s;et their Sons upon Imploy in the Linnen Manufacture; for it will be then perfectly di&s;covered, that Bank-Corn may always be delivered out to the poor, in payment for their work: As now Iron, Wool, Silk, Threads, any Wier, is delivered out to the Smith, Clothier, Weaver, Pin-maker, in part of payment for the Manufactured Commodities,; for at this time mo&s;t payments are made to the poor Handi|craft-man, part Moneys, and part &s;uch Materials as the Commodity was made of which he &s;ells, and he is forc'd to take the Materials at &s;uch Rates as his Chapman plea|&s;eth to impo&s;e, or put upon it.</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider, The&s;e Bank-Granaries will bring out all the Moneys now unimployed, and at pre&s;ent out of Trade, and prevent the keeping of &s;uch quantities of Plate which is now made u&s;e of by many People; for the Bank-Corn being ready Moneys at all times, there will be no occa&s;ion of &s;uch quantities of Plate as mo&s;t People keep by them; which at pre&s;ent is made u&s;e of by many per&s;ons for their immediate Credit.</P>
<P>I being at <HI>Dublin</HI> in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;eventy four, there happened a great Storm, which very much &s;hattered the Ships lying in the Harbor, and blew one to Sea, where Ship and Men peri&s;hed; and blew another upon the Rocks, near the point of <HI>Voth,</HI> where &s;he was &s;taved and broke to pieces, her lading and part of the Men peri&s;hed; at which time I heard many and frequent complaints, by Merchants and Seamen, of the badne&s;s of that Harbor, and the danger that attended the Ships lying there at Anchor; by rea&s;on of hard Sand, low Water, and the continual hazard the Ships were in when the Winds blew hard; there being no Hill or Promontory to de|fend
<PB N="152" REF="92">them from great winds: I al&s;o found by di&s;cour&s;e with the Lord Mayor <HI>Brew&s;ter,</HI> and many others, that the badne&s;s of the Harbour did occa&s;ion the decrea&s;e of Trade and was of great prejudice to it, and the City al&s;o. I then acquainted the Lord Mayor of my thoughts, As to the making a very good Harbour at <HI>Rings-end:</HI> Upon which he did Importune me to be&s;tow &s;ome time in a Survey, and di&s;covery thereof; the which I did, and &s;pent about three weeks time in finding out what is here a&s;&s;erted. Fir&s;t, As to the damage of Trade, by rea&s;on of the badne&s;s of the Harbour. Secondly, The advantage it will be to Trade, if a &s;afe Harbour were made. Thirdly, The way how a good Harbour may be made; with a large Cittadel, and a place for all Maga|zines, and Naval Stores. And Fourthly, What it will co&s;t the doing.</P>
<P>As to the Fir&s;t, The Ships that lye at Anchor, a mile below <HI>Rings-end,</HI> lye upon very hard Sands when the Tide is out; and thereby much damnifying the Ships, if either old or weak built: And the goods are littered to and from the Ships, and many times the Ships receive very great Damage by Storms and great Winds; and &s;o the Ships Crew mu&s;t always be on Board for fear of foul weather: and the Harbour being &s;o bad, cau&s;es Trade to weaken at <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Second, If there were a Harbour made at <HI>Rings-end,</HI> as in the Map de&s;cribed, this advantage would be gained: At pre&s;ent there is at lea&s;t five hun|dred pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> paid to per&s;ons that carry and re-carry people in the <HI>Rings-end</HI> Coaches to and from the Ships, all that would be &s;aved. And all the labour and pains that is now taken by Merchants, Owners, and Sea-men, going from <HI>Dublin</HI> to the Ships, &s;aved: the
<PB N="153" REF="92">great charge at pre&s;ent, by carrying and re-carrying goods by Litters, to and from the Ships, prevented; much more Trade brought, if the new Harbour were made for Ships, that cannot lye upon them hard Sands: And in the new Harbour the Ships will always be float|ing, the water being by art with Sluces kept to thirteen foot depth; and thereby any weak or crazy Ship will lye there &s;afe, and receive no damage at all. A Boy and a Dog in the new Harbour will look to a Ship: And the owner &s;taying any con&s;iderable time for Lading, will in the mean time permit part of the Ships Crue to go &s;hort Voyages, to <HI>Che&s;ter, Leverpool, Bristol,</HI> and the We&s;t of <HI>England;</HI> which will be for the benefit of Trade, and thereby Mariners will not be wanting: And all the &s;ad and dangerous perils now &s;uffered by the Ships in the <HI>Bay</HI> where they now lye, prevented: And by the Ships coming up boldly to <HI>La&s;ey</HI> Hill, there Trade will be made ea&s;ie; the Merchant, Owner, and Ships, all being together. The wi&s;e and knowing people in <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> &s;ay, If the new Harbor were made, there would be Ten thou&s;and pound <HI>per annum</HI> advance in the Kings Cu&s;toms yearly.</P>
<P>As to the Third, There may be made a good Harbor neer <HI>Rings-end,</HI> in the &s;pare piece of Ground that now is every Tide covered with water, which lyes betwixt <HI>Rings-end</HI> and <HI>La&s;ey</HI>-Hill: And in that piece of Land Cuts may be made, as in the Map de&s;cribed, and Mer|chants Hou&s;es built in one piece, and Hou&s;es for the Slaughter-men, Sea-men, and Fi&s;hers, in the other piece. And in the&s;e Cuts all Ve&s;&s;els will lye with that ea&s;e and &s;afety, that it will be to the owners of great advantage, and prevent the pre&s;ent charge they are put unto by Multiplicity of men; and &s;o make Trade Ea&s;ie, Cheap,
<PB N="154" REF="93">and delightful; and at the upper end of one of the Cuts, there may be made a very &s;trong Cittadel, and Hou&s;es for all manner of Stores, which may prove of great convernment to that Kingdom; for there is an old Saying, <HI>Two &s;trings are better than one:</HI> For this Cittadel may be made in that place, with &s;o great ad|vantage, that none can be &s;tronger or better an&s;wer the ends for which it is intended, then this may do; for at pre&s;ent the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dublin</HI> is in a hole in the middle of the Town, and &s;o may many ways mi&s;s of the ends that it was intended for; be&s;ides, in the Ca&s;tle there is very little room for any Military Stores, which would be here very well &s;upplied: And the way for making this Harbor to an&s;wer all the ends here pre&s;cribed, is by making the Cuts as you &s;ee in the Map, with build|ing two great Stone Locks or Sluces to let down and bring up the Ships; and for &s;upplying the&s;e Cuts or Trenches with Water, the Brook coming from <HI>Rofarn|ham,</HI> and <HI>Robuck,</HI> mu&s;t be made u&s;e of; and the Brook now running by <HI>Dublin</HI>-Ca&s;tle mu&s;t be taken up at the &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, and carried a-cro&s;s <HI>Georges Lane,</HI> and &s;o through a wa&s;te piece of Land of Sir. <HI>William Petties,</HI> and &s;o down to <HI>La&s;ey</HI> Hill, to help to augment the Trenches in dry times when Water is &s;carce: If this New Harbor were made, no place in <HI>Holland</HI> were an&s;werable to it, for its advantage and convenience; and as to the Cittadel, certainly none would exceed it, no not <HI>Delfsee</HI> that &s;trong Fort, being made by the very &s;ame advantage, as this may be; which is by the little River that comes from <HI>Groningen</HI> to <HI>Delfsee.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Fourth, which is the charge of making the Harbor and Cittadel, I have taken a great deal of pains when I was there, ca&s;ting up what it might co&s;t; and I
<PB N="155" REF="93">believee it may be compleated for Twenty thou&s;and pound: and certainly as that Harbor now is, and as that piece of Land is overflowed with water every Tide, and under the very &s;ides of the City, it is a very great detriment to Trade and Commerce, and of as great di&s;honour, becau&s;e it's relating to the Metro|polis of a Kingdom; and no place po&s;&s;ible can offer it &s;elf with more advantage, as to Harbour and Cittadel, with ea&s;e, and increa&s;e of Trade, than this place doth, if good practicable Art were rightly imployed upon it, and well back'd by a good Law, well made and fitted to an&s;wer &s;o great and noble a de&s;ign as this would be: The Map of the New Harbor, with the &s;everal Cuts for the Ships to lye in, with the Cittadel, is hereunto af|fixt.</P>
<P>I know writing Books of Trade, where pre&s;ent pro|fit is not within the reach of the Readers under&s;tand|ing, puts a &s;ilence unto the whole Hi&s;tory, be it never &s;o good; for all men are governed by what they un|der&s;tand, in matters relating to gain or lo&s;s: But it &s;hall be my way to come as near as po&s;&s;ibly I can to the under&s;tandings of the parties I intend to appropriate this Di&s;cour&s;e unto. Therefore I will now try my Pen, to &s;ee whether I can get it to beat an Alarm unto all the poor Handicraft People in Three places, <HI>viz. Here|ford&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>London;</HI> and I que&s;tion not, but if they give attendance, and ob&s;erve the fir&s;t word of Command (which is Silence) they &s;hall hear in one hour &s;uch things uttered, as will &s;end them home rejoycing: And fir&s;t I &s;hall &s;peak of <HI>Hereford|&s;hire.</HI> Secondly, of <HI>VVorce&s;ter&s;hire:</HI> and, Thirdly, of <HI>London.</HI> I have &s;aid in my former Di&s;cour&s;e, wherever there is cheapne&s;s of Victuals, good Laws, and a
<PB N="156" REF="94">Navigable River, there Trade may be mo&s;t advan|ced.</P>
<P>For <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> part of that County is already well improved; Fir&s;t, it hath a Navigable River unto the City made by Art; but imperfect at pre&s;ent, and ought to be mended. Secondly, all <HI>&V;rchinfield</HI> is now under a great improvement by Clover, which improvement I &s;ent into them parts, by &s;ending the &s;eed, with Books fully directing the Husbandry; and all per&s;ons at fir&s;t had liberty to receive Seed from Mr. <HI>Belamy</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> and Books of Directions: If the Husbandry did take, and the profit made, as in the Book was pre&s;cribed, then they were to pay Seven-pence a pound for the Seed; if not, nothing: By this way the Seed was put into the Husbandmans hand, and no venture to him; and there was no other way to force that Husbandry upon the People, all former people failing in that de&s;ign for want of good directions: And at pre&s;ent, certainly <HI>&V;rchin|field</HI> is doubled in the value of their Lands by the Clover Husbandry.</P>
<P>The &s;econd improvement <HI>Hereford&s;hire</HI> is under, is &s;ending their Sider to <HI>London</HI> ready Bottled; which Hus|bandry, or Art, I and my Partner &s;everal years &s;ince put there on foot, and cau&s;ed va&s;t quantities to be Bottled up and &s;ent to <HI>Glocester,</HI> from thence to <HI>Lechload,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>London</HI> by Water; we had not been in that method a|bove two years, but others did begin to tread the &s;ame &s;teps, and now it is a great Trade, and a great number of per&s;ons are now driving great Trades with Bottle-Sider; and it hath been the occa&s;ion of erecting Five or Six Gla&s;s-Hou&s;es in them parts. And in <HI>VVorcester&s;hire,</HI> I ha|ving been &s;uccesful in putting that County under Two improvements, I &s;hall in its place venture at a Third; I
<PB N="157" REF="94">know it is very capable to receive it: there is one publick &s;pirited Man lately come into that Countrey, who hath &s;everal times de&s;ired me to acquaint him which way the Countrey might be improved, and Manufacture &s;etled, and declared that he would lay out Moneys and his pains for the good of the Publick.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent there is no &s;ettled Trade at <HI>Hereford,</HI> but the Poor of that Town, and the Countrey round have little imploy, notwith&s;tanding they have there very great conveniences, and a Navigable River to the very City, with much Corn, and that excellent good; and in all &s;uch times as this is, Corn is there very cheap and plen|tiful; and when cheap, they have no Market to go unto thereby to vend their Corn: Formerly <HI>VVales</HI> took away their Corn when plentiful, but &s;ince the <HI>VVel&s;h</HI> took to break up their Mountains, and &s;ow them with Corn, they have Corn &s;ufficient for them&s;elves, and much to &s;pare; &s;o that County &s;hall be always under a plenty, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;etled Manufacture be there fixt, thereby to bring People, and imploy the Poor which are there already: But it is impo&s;&s;ible ever to fix any New Manufacture with &s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s all things that are required for the doing thereof, be well ordered, as to cheapne&s;s of Victuals, and all other conveniences.</P>
<P>Therefore at <HI>Hereford,</HI> in the fir&s;t place, there mu&s;t be Granaries built to hold Corn, and there &s;tow'd in the time of plenty; and this Corn mu&s;t be apropriated wholly for the u&s;e of the&s;e People that work in the Ma|nufacture; and thereby they never will eat dear Bread, or drink dear Drink; and the Granaries mu&s;t be made as I have directed: And the be&s;t Trade that I know which will mo&s;t fit that place, becau&s;e it can never mi&s;s of a plenty, as to Bread and Drink, will be fine-&s;pun
<PB N="158" REF="95">Threds and Tape; and my Rea&s;ons why that will be mo&s;t fitte&s;t for that place, are the&s;e; Fir&s;t, <HI>Hereford</HI> is at the head of a Navigable River. Secondly, It is on the Borders of <HI>VVales;</HI> and if they want hands, and the Trade &s;hould enlarge it &s;elf, from <HI>VVales</HI> there would pour down People upon them, when they &s;ee there is Moneys to be gained. Thirdly, By the ad|vantage of the Navigable River, all things will be car|ried to and from them, to &s;upply the Trade with ea&s;e and cheapne&s;s. Fourthly, At pre&s;ent there is no &s;etled Manufacture. Fifthly, That place will an&s;wer well to furni&s;h with their Commodities all <HI>VVales</HI> up <HI>Sea|vern, Bristol,</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> And where that Trade is &s;etled in foreign parts, the Places are very Rich; wit|ne&s;s <HI>Friburgh</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Dort</HI> in <HI>Holland:</HI> The&s;e Two Towns are the great Ma&s;ters of the&s;e Trades; <HI>Friburgh</HI> for Tape, and <HI>Dort</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> for Threds: And certainly at <HI>Hereford</HI> the&s;e Commodities may be made as cheap as in any part of <HI>Germany</HI> or <HI>Holland:</HI> But &s;till regard is to be had to the&s;e things, cheap Bread and Drink, and always certain; Moneys at low intere&s;t, with Spinning-Schools, as I have directed in this Di|&s;cour&s;e; with Four &s;hillings in the pound advance of Cu|&s;toms to be laid upon all Threds and Tapes brought from beyond the Seas.</P>
<P>I know there are &s;ome Gentlemen of the Country I now treat of, will be very inqui&s;itive, and de&s;irous to know how this Trade &s;hall be fixt at fir&s;t; and when fixt, how to govern it, that it may not mi&s;carry, as did the Linnen Manufacture at <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> and many other Publick Linnen Manufactures formerly &s;et up in <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>I will give them my thoughts at pre&s;ent, which is the
<PB N="159" REF="96">be&s;t and conveniente&s;t way for the ordering of the Thred and Tape-Trade at <HI>Hereford.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Build your Granary, and Stock it with Corn and Malt for Three years, &s;ufficient for &s;o many People as are to be imployed; then build a Brew-hou&s;e and a Bake-hou&s;e both together, clo&s;e by your Granaries, for your Manufacturing People, and to be delivered to them as they &s;pend it; for it is a great Error with us in <HI>England,</HI> that Publick Bake hou&s;es and Brew-hou&s;es are not fixt for the &s;upply of the &s;everal Handicraft Trades, thereby to &s;ave all the time now &s;pent in provi|ding Bread and Drink for the family, which time might be better imployed in their &s;everal Trades; and having the Bread and Drink at all times provided to their hands, will prevent the laying out of Moneys for &s;uch u&s;es, and Hou&s;es of le&s;s Rent will &s;erve their turns; and then all the People in the Family will be in the con|&s;tant imploy of the Trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. Send for one Man from <HI>Friburgh,</HI> to put you in the true way and Method of making of the Tape; and to bring over two Engines, one to Weave Narrow Tape, and the other to weave Broad Tape, with Wheels to Spin.</P>
<P N="3">3. Send for one Man from <HI>Dort</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> to put you in the true way of ordering the fine Threds.</P>
<P N="4">4. Send for a Spinning Mi&s;tri&s;s out of <HI>Germany,</HI> to order and govern the little Maids, and in&s;truct them in the Art of Spinning.</P>
<P N="5">5. Send for a Man from <HI>Harlem</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> to Whi|ten your Tapes and Threds.</P>
<P>This being done, with all things before &s;pecified, That Trade cannot mi&s;s taking great root at <HI>Hereford,</HI> and in proce&s;s of time will be the &s;taple Trade of that
<PB N="160" REF="97">part of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> and no place, as to cheap Victuals of all &s;orts, with multitude of hands unimploy|ed, exceeds tho&s;e parts we treat of: And the thing we now treat of, will be no laborious bu&s;ine&s;s; but may in time prove of great advantage, for the younger Sons of Gentlemen to fall to, and prevent the idle habit that many are now accu&s;tomed to: And this Trade mu&s;t be of great benefit to the Publick, for at pre&s;ent they are Foreign Trades, and the whole benefit does ac|crew to them, and the con&s;umption and lo&s;s to us.</P>
<P>This Tape and Thred-Trade to be fixt, is of much more difficulty to be brought to perfection, than if there were &s;ome &s;mall Trade in the place already; but the comfort of that place may be, if they once fix well in that Manufacture, then they will deter all others &s;et|ting up the &s;ame, and &s;o con&s;equently be at la&s;t the great Ma&s;ters of it, as <HI>Manchester</HI> is of all things it Trades in.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acquaint the Gentlemen of <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> that the River <HI>Wy</HI> mu&s;t be mended, and made more conveni|ent than now it is, that &s;o Barges may pa&s;s and repa&s;s with ea&s;e, and without hazard; for Trade will not admit of &s;uch delays, as of nece&s;&s;ity there mu&s;t be, if the River be not timely mended; and <HI>Hereford&s;hire</HI> mu&s;t never pre|tend to come under a great improvement, if that River be not fully compleated, and the River <HI>Lugg</HI> made Na|vigable as high as <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> or one Mile or two further: And if that were done, then <HI>Hereford</HI> would be to great part of <HI>Radnor, Brecknock, Cardigan,</HI> and <HI>Moumouth&s;hire,</HI> as <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> is to North-<HI>Wales: Shrews|bury</HI> lying upon the Navigable River, hath all things brought up to the Town, and thereby invites North-<HI>Wales</HI> by the way of Barter, and otherwi&s;e, to trade
<PB N="161" REF="97">with them. The like will be at <HI>Hereford</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Countreys I name, if once <HI>Hereford</HI> were &s;etled in a con&s;tant Trade; and that may be with ea&s;e done, when the River <HI>Wy</HI> is compleated, for then it will have the advantage of joyning its communication with other Rivers: As for Example, it will have all its goods and Siders carried to <HI>London,</HI> and Goods from <HI>London</HI> back by Water to <HI>Hereford,</HI> and &s;o the charge of Carriage will be much le&s;&s;ened, and Trade much more impro|ved; for at the Head of Navigable Rivers there mu&s;t and will be Trade, provided the River carriage comes once to be made certain and cheap: You may ob&s;erve in the Map of Rivers in the Book, there is a kindne&s;s intended to <HI>Hereford;</HI> for it is taken into the a&s;&s;ociation of the Rivers, and why it &s;hould be &s;o, there are many Rea&s;ons may be given.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, Hereford</HI> will &s;uck in all Trade of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Counties before named; and there are va&s;t quantities of Sider to come for <HI>London;</HI> provided the way take, of making the Rivers of <HI>England</HI> communicable, as in the Book and Map directed: Then <HI>Hereford</HI> will have a great benefit, for the Barges at <HI>Hereford</HI> may be in a con&s;tant motion, carrying and re-carrying Goods, and all &s;uch commodities the Countrey &s;ends out, or hath occa&s;ion to want, and at very ea&s;ie Rates; and I am &s;ure it is a pity, and next unto a &s;hame, that a Coun|trey that hath the be&s;t of Wool, the be&s;t of Sider, the be&s;t of Fruit, the be&s;t of Wheat, and the be&s;t of Ri|vers, &s;hould until this time be unimproved: But &s;o it mu&s;t for ever be, unle&s;s the&s;e things be done; A vo|luntary Regi&s;ter, Publick Granaries, your River <HI>Wy</HI> compleatly made Navigable, Schools as in <HI>Germany</HI> for young Maids to Spin, Bake-hou&s;e and Brew-hou&s;e
<PB N="162" REF="98">to &s;upply all People that are in the Manufacture; for Trade will go where &s;he is mo&s;t courted, and be&s;t pro|vided for; witne&s;s <HI>Holland, Legorn, Hambrough</HI> and <HI>Dantzick:</HI> So much for <HI>Hereford.</HI></P>
<P>I am now for demon&s;trating the benefit that may come unto the poor decayed Clothiers of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Kiddermin&s;ter,</HI> as al&s;o to the Cappers of <HI>Bewdley</HI> in their &s;everal Trades, provided they had Granaries to hold Corn in time of plenty; and that &s;uch Granaries were fitted and &s;etled, as in my Book is directed: And I &s;hall di&s;cover the great mi&s;eries each of the&s;e Trades now groan under, for want of certain and cheap Victu|als at all times, as Bread and Drink, with Moneys at low intere&s;t when they need it, to drive their Trades.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, as to the Trade of making Caps at <HI>Bewdley,</HI> it is grown &s;o low, that great part of the Ancient Cap-makers in that Town are wholly decayed, and the re&s;t at this pre&s;ent are in a very low condition; and the great poverty that is upon them, renders them to be at the mercy of the <HI>London</HI>-Factors which deal for Caps, that Trade being got into two or three Factors hands, and thereby force the makers to accept of &s;uch Rates as they plea&s;e to give; whereby that Trade is much decay'd in that Town, and like in few years to fall to the ground: And at pre&s;ent there are but Two ways to relieve the People that make Caps in <HI>Bewdley.</HI></P>
<P>The one is, to get them&s;elves Incorporated by Act of Parliament, and therein get &s;uch a Law made, as may be for the benefit of the Trade in all particulars; and the Bill mu&s;t, be &s;o drawn, that the Traders and Makers of Caps may come under &s;uch a Regulation, as may conduce to the benefit of the Trade in general: If they prepare their Parliament-Man to be their Friend,
<PB N="163" REF="98">to carry in the Bill next &s;itting of Parliament, it will do well.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way to do that Trade good, is by their joining together, and procuring part of a Granary at <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> to put in Corn and Malt when it is cheap, and there to remain for food at all times when they have occa&s;ion to u&s;e it; and at <HI>Stratford</HI> or there|abouts is always the be&s;t and cheape&s;t Wheat and Malt in all them parts of <HI>England;</HI> and from <HI>Stratford</HI> to <HI>Bewdley</HI> it will be carried for one Peny the Bu&s;h|el, they having free pa&s;&s;age through the Locks and Slu|ces upon <HI>Avon,</HI> without paying any Tax for the &s;ame; the which &s;hall be granted, provided I can prevail with my Partners in that River to remit their &s;hares: And when there is Corn in Bank, there is a <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and Corn and Malt being taken into Granary when cheap, as this year is, then the Capper and his Family cannot po&s;&s;ibly eat dear Bread, nor drink dear Drink, and thereby he will be able to drive his Trade with ea&s;e and Comfort: But I mu&s;t tell the poor Cap-makers not only the benefit of the Corn in Granaries laid up in cheap times, but I mu&s;t al&s;o tell him, becau&s;e he is my Neighbour, That there is another piece of good Hus|bandry to be u&s;ed after the Corn is fixt in the Bank, and that is a material thing to Trades-men, and to poor men that work in all &s;orts of Handicrafts; at fir&s;t you will look upon it as a &s;light thing, but when you have well weighed and con&s;idered of the Rea&s;ons, you will &s;ay it mu&s;t be: And when you once have it in u&s;e, nei|ther you nor any that come after you, will let it fall.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have a Bake-hou&s;e and Brew-hou&s;e of your own, appropriated for your Trade, which mu&s;t be fixt and &s;et up both together, with &s;ome &s;mall Granaries to
<PB N="164" REF="99">hold your Corn and Malt; and from this Bake-hou&s;e, and Brew-hou&s;e, at all times you will receive &s;uch Bread and Drink as you have occa&s;ion to u&s;e, or as your part of Corn and Malt comes unto, which you have in Gra|nary: and the benefits of this Bake-hou&s;e and Brew-hou&s;e will be many.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Corn out of the Granary at <HI>Stratford,</HI> will be brought and lodged in Granary at the Bake-hou&s;e, as there is occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it, and there|by prevent the lo&s;s and damage that it would be lyable to, being taken into every Mans private Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All Bread and Drink being made and pro|vided in this Publick Bake-hou&s;e and Brew-hou&s;e, will cau&s;e the Trades-mans Wife, and Servants, to be at much more lei&s;ure to attend their Trades; for great part of the Womans time is taken up in providing Bread and Drink, getting Fewel, running about to get Yea&s;t or Barm, as they call it, and &s;ometimes &s;tay to crack a Pot or two with the good Ho&s;t that allows them Yea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This way of a Bake-hou&s;e and Brew-hou&s;e to be u&s;ed for the benefit of the Trade, will prevent all the charge that Trades-men in the Countrey are put unto in buying, and providing all things wanting for the&s;e purpo&s;es; as al&s;o the Trades-men will not be ne|ce&s;&s;itated for &s;o great a Hou&s;e, as now he mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity have; nor to &s;it at &s;o great a Rent as now he doth: But I know this Publick Brew-hou&s;e and Bake-hou&s;e, will meet with a &s;mart objection from mo&s;t of the Cappers Wives that now Brew their own Beer, and that is this, Sir, we Brewing our own Beer, we have Grains for our Pigs, and we cannot be without a Hog or Two. My an&s;wer is, That from the Publick Brew-hou&s;e,
<PB N="165" REF="99">they will have their proportion of Grains ac|cording as they put in their quantities of Malt; and if you Brewed your Beer your &s;elf, you could have no more: But I know I can plea&s;e the Cappers Wives, in telling them what will come to pa&s;s, if they have Corn in the&s;e Bank-Granaries, and Publick Brew-hou&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Malt Brewed in great quantities, makes much more, and better Drink, than if Brewed in many and &s;mall parcels.</P>
<P N="2">2. When you have Corn and Malt in Granaries, nei|ther&punc;you nor your Family need to eat or drink dear Bread or Drink.</P>
<P N="3">3. Bank-Corn will alway be ready Moneys in your Pur&s;es, it being a thing that you may Transfer, and &s;o alter the property, by entring it with the Clerk of your Company.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> When there is good &s;tore of Corn and Malt in Bank, if the Man dies, leaving Five or Six Children, the Widow &s;hall not want for a Husband; for there being &s;ufficient Bread and Drink for Three years in Bank, the Children and Apprentices will be a great benefit to the party that Marries the Widow, and &s;o go on comfortably in their Trades: But let a Man as things now are, leave his Wife a Hundred pounds, and dye, and leave her Six Children, &s;he may &s;tay long e|nough for a Husband; for this Hundred pound po&s;&s;i|bly is at intere&s;t, and as things are now with us, a Man cannot get one Debt in Three without a Lawyer, and not one in Three to be had without apparent hazard: Now this Bank-Corn Credit will never be que&s;tioned: &s;o the Man being &s;ure of that as undeniably his own, he will be the ea&s;ier induced to take the Widow, if &s;he hath a few faults; but to take a Widow with indiffer|ent
<PB N="166" REF="100">conditions, many Children, and her Husbands E|&s;tate very hazardous, and uncertain to be recovered, is not prudence.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Your Corn in Bank is free from all incum|brances, and &s;o frees you from Lawyers, or the charge attending it, and thereby it will give you credit of ta|king up Moneys at all times to drive your Trades; Corn in Bank is Money in Pur&s;e, nay better.</P>
<P>I will give you one in&s;tance: &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Wowen</HI> of <HI>Bewdley</HI> hath One thou&s;and quarters of Wheat in the Bank-Granary at <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> which now is worth but One thou&s;and pound; Mr. <HI>Women</HI> hath oc|ca&s;ion for Moneys to drive his Trade, he gives notice in Town he wants Five hundred pounds, and will give Bank-Credit in Corn for it; immediately tumbles out the Moneys unimployed, and is lent to Mr. <HI>Wowen,</HI> and the property of Corn by way of Mortgage is Transfer|red to Five Per&s;ons that lent the Moneys; one of the Per&s;ons that lent Mr. <HI>VVowen</HI> one of the Hundred pounds, ows Mr. <HI>Simon VVood</HI> One hundred pounds, Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> calls for his Moneys, his debtor &s;aith he hath no Moneys, he mu&s;t &s;tay: No, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> I will not, I will &s;ue you for it: Then the Debtor proffers his Ticket of Bank-Corn to Mr. <HI>VVood,</HI> Mr. <HI>VVood</HI> ac|cepts of the &s;ecurity, and Transfers the &s;ame to his Creditor in <HI>London</HI> whom he owes Money to; the Cre|ditor accepts of it; Why? becau&s;e he finds it Regi&s;tred at the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> and it is to him ready Moneys any hour in the day, if he want Moneys; but if he doth not want Money, then he &s;uffers it to go on, increa&s;ing in Bank, until he hath occa&s;ion to u&s;e it: And I hope here is no harm done. But I will drive this Nail a little further: Suppo&s;e this Creditor in <HI>London</HI> of Mr. <HI>Simon
<PB N="167" REF="100">VVoods,</HI> Marries a Daughter, Do you think that this Bank-Ticket of Corn in Granary will not pay part of the portion? Or &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>VVoods</HI> Creditor dies, and leaves to his Wife and Children a Thou&s;and pounds in Tickets of Bank-Corn in Granary, do you not think it is the be&s;t vi&s;ible &s;ecurity extant? Yea it is. Do you not think that his Widdow may Marry again to a better advantage, than if this Thou&s;and pounds were owing by &s;everal Per&s;ons by Book-Debts? I pray, do you think this &s;ecurity by Bank-Corn in Granary, would not of a &s;udden enliven Trade, and make it quick? I &s;ay it will, and will be the only &s;ecurity of <HI>England:</HI> And if ever any &s;uch thing were de&s;irable, ju&s;t now is the time; for all Trades are in a con&s;umption, all &s;e|curities of Lands uncertain, and per&s;onal-&s;ecurity very difficult, and Suits of Law daily multiplied with great charges, and mi&s;erable &s;pectacles, Pri&s;ons full, and ma|ny near peri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Now good Reader ob&s;erve what benefits and advan|tages are here received, by this way of Bank-Corn in Granary; The poor Handicraft Man, Wife, Children, and Servants, are always fed with cheap Bread and Drink, and may be at lea&s;ure if they plea&s;e, to follow their Trades the clo&s;er; becau&s;e the whole trouble of buying Corn, Grinding, Brewing, Baking, and getting Fuel, is taken off their hands: It al&s;o prevents the lay|ing out Moneys in many things, which otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have done, if this Publick Brew-hou&s;e and Bake-hou&s;e had not been provided for them; it doth al&s;o give him ea&s;e in his Rent, for now a &s;mall Hou&s;e will &s;erve his turn, and &s;o a &s;mall Rent paid.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve how the party that hath this Bank-Credit in Corn doth convenience him&s;elf with Moneys when he
<PB N="168" REF="101">wants it, and how the Ticket of his Bank-Corn pays the Country Mercer, and with the &s;ame Ticket, the Mercer pays the <HI>London</HI> Haberda&s;her, and with the &s;ame Ticket, the Haberda&s;her takes up Moneys at any time, if he plea&s;eth; or if he thinks fit, he Marrieth his Daughter, and gives Bank-Corn in lieu of a Portion; or if he dies, it is a good firm &s;etled maintenance for his Wife and Children; and One thou&s;and pound thus &s;etled, may prove better to the poor Widow and her Children, than Five thou&s;and pounds of any other of her Husbands Credits that lies out.</P>
<P>And here would ri&s;e a Miracle, if the Cappers of <HI>Bewdley</HI> &s;hould turn Bankers; What? the poore&s;t Trade of <HI>England!</HI> Yes, they may, and prove a truer, and po&s;&s;ibly, a better Bank than ever was &s;een in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> for all Banks which have good Anchoridg and Foundation, into &s;uch Banks will tumble all unim|ployed Ca&s;h. If the Cappers come once to have Corn in Bank, to the value of Two thou&s;and pounds, imme|diately their Neighbours will de&s;ire to come into their a&s;&s;ociation: And I know there are &s;ome near <HI>Bewdley,</HI> that have Moneys good &s;tore. What is here &s;et down for the Cap-makers of <HI>Bewdley,</HI> is al&s;o intended for the Weavers of <HI>Kidderminster,</HI> who are in great fear of the Factors, as they &s;ay; but I will tell no tales.</P>
<P>But this I know, if the poor Weavers of <HI>Kidder|min&s;ter,</HI> had a propriety in a Granary at <HI>Stratford</HI> up|on <HI>Avon,</HI> and a Brew-hou&s;e and Bake-hou&s;e at <HI>Kidder|minster,</HI> and Corn and Malt in time of plenty laid up, Then I am, and &s;o they may be &s;atisfied, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for that Trade, ever to depart from that Town; for cheap Drink, and cheap Bread at all times, will make cheap Commodities: And then the poor at <HI>Kid|dermin&s;ter</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="101">need not fear being cru&s;hed or kept under by &s;uch as have great Stocks; for in <HI>England</HI> at this day, in many places, the Richer &s;ort of Men in the handicraft way, who have great Stocks, do &s;o order their affairs, that it's impo&s;&s;ible for a poor Man to rai&s;e or advance his fortunes, or get any thing to leave his Wife at his decea&s;e, or Portions for his Children; be|cau&s;e he that hath the great Stock, buys all his materi|als at the be&s;t hand, and is able to keep his Goods for the be&s;t Market; but the poor Man is forced many times to buy his Materials he makes his Commodity with, of &s;ome of his own Trade, and is thereby forced to buy dear, and &s;ell cheap; and certainly that way mu&s;t make them poor, and very poor.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;everal times many of the&s;e great Deal|ers in the Handicraft-way, wi&s;h that &s;ome-body or o|ther would take their Poor off their Hands, and &s;eem|ingly bemoan the &s;ad condition they were in; I have enquired into tho&s;e mens e&s;tates, and I have often found, that they were Merchants as well as Mechanicks, &s;ome of them buying Silks at the be&s;t hand, and &s;elling it to the poor Weavers; others buy Wire, and then &s;ell it to the poor of their own Trades to make Pins, and afterwards take off the Commodity when Manufactur|ed, and give them part Commodities unwrought, and part Moneys; by which way, the poor Handicraft Man is forc'd to let part of that which is gained in the Com|modity, go to one of his own Trade; and the cau&s;e of all this, is want of pre&s;ent Money or Credit, with cheap Bread and Drink: But I have heard of the other hand, great complaints by the labouring Mechanick, that the great Dealers of their own Trades did undo
<PB N="170" REF="102">them. I will believe both parties, and take all for truth that is &s;aid of both hands; but &s;eeing the great Ma&s;ters of the Mechanick Trades, de&s;ire their Poor may be off their hands, I am re&s;olved to take them at their words.</P>
<P>And now all you poor Men in <HI>England,</HI> that work or labour in Mechanick Arts, you are mine: I know now I &s;hall have many que&s;tions asked me, and among&s;t the re&s;t, What will you do with all the&s;e poor People which you &s;ay &s;hall be yours? My an&s;wer is, I will make them all rich and happy, and their Families al&s;o.</P>
<P>I will now begin to &s;hew them the way; but when they are Reading my Project, as mo&s;t will call it, I or|der them to act like Soldiers, and command Silence; Suffer not your Wives to u&s;e any Twit-twat, nor ask que&s;tions by the way; but Read it over and over again, and then lay all your Heads together, Wife, Children, and Servants, and it's po&s;&s;ible the younger Fry may live to &s;ee it Crown'd with a beautiful Blazing-head, as the Monument near <HI>London-Bridg</HI> is with the Urn.</P>
<P>Now my Children: for &s;o I mu&s;t call you, for I now will take care for you all (I will begin): Art thou for Revenge? I know thou art; for thou knowe&s;t where thy Shoo hath pinch'd thee long: Well, in this ca&s;e, I think Revenge is lawful, becau&s;e I know what thou wilt be at; but I ask thee this que&s;tion, What is the Revenge that will be&s;t fit thy temper, and by thee is mo&s;t de&s;ired? Sir, I de&s;ire to be revenged of &s;ome of the great Men of our Trade; but it is no further, than I may have &s;ome part of the benefit of the Trade as well as they; for it is not fit that &s;ome &s;hould have &s;o much, and others &s;o little, for it is we poor Men that have
<PB N="171" REF="102">mo&s;t Fingers. My Child, thou &s;halt have thy de&s;ire, if it be not thy own fault; I know you and &s;uch as you, with your Families, are the Per&s;ons that work, labour, and toyl to make others Rich: Now let me intreat thee to do the &s;ame for thy &s;elf, as thou did&s;t for others; then believe me the work is done.</P>
<P>Now Child, I charge thee be a good Husband, for without that, all will be in vain; and that being per|formed by thee, here will be thy condition; when thou come&s;t to have in thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion Twenty pounds, ei|ther from thy Friends, or by thy own labour, then lay it into the Bank-Granary, &s;ome for Wheat, &s;ome for Malt; admit thou wa&s;t now to begin, for thy Twenty|pounds thou &s;halt have Six-&s;core Bu&s;hels of Wheat, and Three-&s;core Bu&s;hels of Malt: This Corn and Malt &s;hall &s;erve thee Three years, being Seven in Family, thy Self, Wife, a Man, a Maid, and Three Children. Now my dear Child, here is Bread and Drink &s;ufficient, and that is a comfort; and thy &s;elf, Wife, Servants, and Children, at perfect liberty to follow your &s;everal and re&s;pective imploys; and certainly thou art a very bad Husband, if thou do&s;t not on a &s;udden advance thy e|&s;tate, and get Moneys in Bank-Corn; becau&s;e thou ha&s;t nothing to pay for Bread and Drink: But here lies a great objection to be an&s;wered, VVhat &s;hall I do for Moneys to buy &s;ome Materials to &s;et our fingers at work (for now all is in Malt and Corn)? I an&s;wer, thou mai&s;t at any time take up Ten or Twelve pounds, or more, upon a Mortgage of thy Bank-Corn, to buy Materials to work into Manufacture.

<P>But I mu&s;t Beg leave, in the fir&s;t place, that I may give &s;ome Rea&s;ons, which have occa&s;ioned the Abate|ment of Trade in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and when I have done with them, then I will apply the be&s;t Re|medyes that lye in my knowledge, how the Trade may be recovered into the City again, whereby it will clearly appear, that Trade will be forc't to come and take her a|boad in the City of <HI>London</HI> as formerly.</P>
<P N="1">1. Rea&s;on, In the Building the City of <HI>London,</HI> there were two great Errors committed, one was of Omi&s;&s;ion, the o|ther of Commi&s;&s;ion; That of Commi&s;&s;ion is, The Build|ings being made &s;o great, thereby the Rents were very High, (at fir&s;t) and when a Trade&s;man had paid his Fine, fixt his Counters and Pre&s;&s;es, and furni&s;hed his hou&s;e, accord|ing
<PB N="178" REF="106">as his Wife plea&s;ed to have it, or as he thought fit to have it furni&s;hed to get a Wife, that great Charge be|ing at fir&s;t Contracted, did &s;o le&s;&s;en the Trade&s;mans Stock, that many were forc't to go into the Suburbs, and &s;ome into the Countries. The thing of Omi&s;&s;ion, was the Neglect of putting Hou&s;es to be new built under a Regi&s;ter, when the Act pa&s;t for Building the City, the Credit of which if done, would have been better than Ready Moneys; for by vertue of &s;uch undeniable Securi|ty as Regi&s;tred Hou&s;es, Banks (yea many ju&s;t Banks) and Lumber Hou&s;es would have &s;prang up, which had &s;o enliven'd Trade, and pre&s;erved the Poor out of the hands of the U&s;urers, and pawn-Brokers, that the City would have been like a Bee Hive, all would have crept in as long as there was any room, and when no more room, then they would have &s;warm'd abroad.</P>
<P N="2">II. Rea&s;on is, The very great Charge which &s;ome Com|panies put their Members to in the City of <HI>London</HI> proves many times the ruine of &s;ome poor Trade&s;men.</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;evere cu&s;toms and practices that &s;ome of the greate&s;t Traders in the Mechanick Arts, u&s;e unto &s;ome of their own Trade, by &s;cruing and pinching them in &s;uch things they &s;ell them in their nece&s;&s;ity. But I will &s;ay no more of that, here being Relief to be had in that ca&s;e, for all the poor that work in the Mechanick way, if it be not their faults.</P>
<P N="4">IV. There is no care taken for the amendment of the River <HI>Lee,</HI> which runs from <HI>Ware</HI> to <HI>Bow,</HI> in all dry times much out of order, nor any notice or regard taken of the great defects that are in the Navigation&punc; up|on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> from <HI>Oxford</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> which River would be the be&s;t Servant the City hath, if com|pleated as it ought to be. If I were a Doctor, and could
<PB N="179" REF="106">read a Lecture of the Circulation of the Blood, I &s;hould by that awaken all the City: For <HI>London</HI> is as the Heart is in the Body, and the great Rivers are as its Veins; let them be &s;topt, there will then be great danger either of death, or el&s;e &s;uch Veins will apply them&s;elves to feed &s;ome other part of the Body, which it was not properly in|tended for: For I tell you, Trade will creep and &s;teal away from any place, provided &s;he may be better treated el&s;e|where. Con&s;ider the two great Rivers of <HI>England (viz.) Severne</HI> and <HI>Thames,</HI> they mu&s;t be the occa&s;ion of admi|ni&s;tring the benefit of Trade to <HI>London;</HI> but as things now are with the&s;e Rivers, under their &s;everal defects and imperfections in their Navigations, the&s;e Rivers ad|mini&s;ter very little benefit to <HI>London,</HI> or the Trade therein.</P>
<P>My whole De&s;ign at this time, and in this Sheet, is to relieve the hone&s;t poor laborious Handicraft Trade&s;man in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and thereby invite Trade into the City again, and al&s;o line out the way how it may be done, whereby it &s;hall evidently appear, to be his own fault, if he be not rich and happy, and his Wife and Children after his Decea&s;e be left in a comfortable con|dition, with the great Advantages it will admini&s;ter to &s;uch as &s;hall be their Apprentices and Servants. But all you Handicraft&s;men, who&s;e Cau&s;e I here plead, mu&s;t take e&s;pecial notice of my Maxims: Fir&s;t, Remember Hone&s;ty and Honour is as nece&s;&s;ary for Trade, as Di&s;ci|pline is for an Army. Secondly, Remember that Honour and Hone&s;ty bring Riches, Riches bring Strength, and Strength brings Trade. Thirdly, Ob&s;erve and con&s;ider that all manufactured Commodities, made with cheap Materials, cheap Victuals, with Moneys at all times when wanted at ea&s;ie Intere&s;t, and beneficial Laws, well made
<PB N="180" REF="107">and well applyed to the proper ju&s;t ends of things ma|nufactured, will make cheap Commodities, and thereby increa&s;e the Manufactures to great quantities, and &s;o in|crea&s;e the Trade. I have already &s;hewed you in five &s;e|veral particulars, &s;ome of the Cau&s;es which have forc'd Trade out of your City, &s;ome of them are not within the power either of the Law or your Magi&s;trates to pre|vent, but &s;ome are; and the&s;e which may be done with ea&s;e, I que&s;tion not but your Magi&s;trates will u&s;e their endeavours to bring them to pa&s;s. The which are, put|ting all the New Buildings in the City of <HI>London</HI> under a Regi&s;ter, and procuring a Law to pa&s;s, to enable the &s;everal Companies of Handicraft Trade&s;men in <HI>London,</HI> hereafter mentioned, to have power to make the River <HI>Sharwell</HI> Navigable from <HI>Oxford</HI> to <HI>Banbury,</HI> to build Granaries to hold Corn, with Mills or any other En|gines to go by Water, to be made u&s;e of for the good and benefit of the &s;everal Companies, whereby Art will be incouraged, and Trade convenienced. The Names of the Companies are as followeth; and the Copy of the Bill to be carried into Parliament, for the accompli&s;h|ing of the &s;ame follows after; The Company of Wea|vers, the Company of Pin-Makers, the Company of Turners, the Company of Water-men, the Company of Silk-Throwers, the Company of Felt-Makers, the Company of Pavers, the Company of Cloth-Workers, the Company of Pla&s;terers, the Company of Joyners, the Company of Embroiderers, the Company of Brick-Layers, the Company of Smiths, the Company of Ar|mourers, and the Company of Carpenters.</P>

I will now give you one In&s;tance what this way of Corn and Mault in Granary will do, if once well fixt at <HI>An&s;lo</HI> Bridge in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> with Mills to grind Corn, and Engines &s;et up there to go by Water, to ac|commodate Trade. Suppo&s;e I were to make Pins, I know that is the &s;malle&s;t Manufacture that is now made, and there are many Poor of that Trade, that make hard &s;hift to live, I think I could make Pins three pence in the Shilling cheaper than they can now be made in <HI>London,</HI> by the greate&s;t Dealers in that Trade, and all done by the Poor People that are now chargeable to the Pari&s;h. The manner and way of making the Pins &s;o cheap, is or may be very obvious, if People are not ignorantly blind. Fir&s;t, the Wyer mu&s;t be bought at the be&s;t hand, and &s;ent to <HI>An&s;lo</HI> Bridge, and there drawn and made &s;izeable and fit to make all &s;orts of Pins; and this to be done by the force and power of a Water Wheel, which will draw more Wire in one day, than &s;ix men can by the way u&s;ed by arm labour in the &s;ame time. Secondly, The&s;e Poor to make Pins mu&s;t be fixt and &s;ettled near the Granaries at <HI>An&s;lo Bridge,</HI> there to work by good Rules and &s;trict Orders.
<PB N="186" REF="111">Thirdly, There they mu&s;t have a publick Brew-hou&s;e and Bake hou&s;e, then all Bread and Drink will be made very cheap; and when the Pins are made, they are in the heart of <HI>England,</HI> and may be &s;ent down the River <HI>Avon</HI> into <HI>Severne,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Bri&s;tol, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tchester;</HI> and in the way of barter, the Pin-Makers may have Chee&s;e from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and Bacon from <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> for Pins; and the Chee&s;e and Bacon may be brought down the River <HI>Severne,</HI> and up the River <HI>Avon,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>An&s;lo Bridge</HI> by Land, to feed the Pin-Makers.

But ob&s;erve, if bread and drink were always certain and cheap at <HI>London,</HI> for the benefit of the Mechanick Trades, and well &s;ettled, to be at all times de|livered to the Members of the &s;everal Companies, then in <HI>London</HI> could be no Poor, nor want of Trade; for then men would &s;trive who &s;hould employ mo&s;t hands, he that employed mo&s;t would get mo&s;t.

<P>Now I mu&s;t make a &s;tep to <HI>We&s;tche&s;ter,</HI> and endeavour to find out how the River <HI>Dee</HI> may be made &s;o Navigable to <HI>Bangor-bridge,</HI> that thereby it may be made commu|nicable with the River <HI>Severne.</HI> In the Month of <HI>July</HI> 1674. I was prevailed with by a Per&s;on of Honour to &s;ur|vey the River <HI>Dee,</HI> running by the City of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, and finding the River choked with the Sands that a Ve&s;&s;el of twenty Tuns could not come to that No|ble City, and the Ships forc'd to lye at <HI>Nea&s;on,</HI> in a very bad Harbour, whereby the Ships receive much damage, and Trade made &s;o uncertain and chargeable, that the Trade of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> is much decayed, and gone to <HI>Leverpool;</HI> and that old great City in danger of being ruin'd, if the River <HI>Dee</HI> be not made Navigable by Act of Parliament, and Ships brought to the City.

<P>REader, I beg thy pardon, if I have kept thee long in reading this Di&s;cour&s;e; but I hope thou wilt not be angry: for when I put Pen to Paper, I intended to be brief. I know there are many, before they have well weighed the Contents of this Book, will think that it may much &s;hake their Intere&s;ts, and &s;o will be enqui|ring after the Compiler, and of his Education: And how it is po&s;&s;ible that one man &s;hould know all that is in this Book a&s;&s;erted; and will &s;ay the&s;e are notions of a hot Brain. I know others, who&s;e Sores are great, and Wounds dangerous, and de&s;ire a cure thereby to live at peace (both in their E&s;tates and Per&s;ons) will be apt to a&s;cribe more to the Compiler than is due. For in this Age mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent humours are to detract, and abu&s;e, where Intere&s;t is pinched or laid open to the World; and on the other hand too much to cry up and extol tho&s;e that expect benefit and relief. As to both &s;orts of Inqui&s;itors, I will &s;ave them a labour, and give them a &s;hort Account of my Education and Improvement. I was an Apprentice to a Linnen Dra|per when this King was born, and continued at the Trade &s;ome years: But the Shop being too narrow and &s;hort for my large mind, I took leave of my Ma&s;ter, but &s;aid nothing.
