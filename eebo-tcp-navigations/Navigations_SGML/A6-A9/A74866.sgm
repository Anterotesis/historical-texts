<HEAD>TO The INGENIOUS, INDUSTRIOUS, and Yonger SEA-MEN.</HEAD>
<P>_AS it is chiefely for your profit that I write; &s;o I hope, that though I &s;hall be condemned of others, yet I &s;hall gain your pardon. I confe&s;&s;e my la|bour may &s;eeme needle&s;&s;e, after &s;o many learned Authots, to &s;et forth a|ny thing of this &s;ubject. And it may be accounted a pre&s;umptious folly for any to goe about to teach Sea-men in their Art, e&s;pecially in the&s;e times, wherein there were never more, nor more skilfull Sea|men. But in an&s;wer hereto take notice of the&s;e con&s;ide|rations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That many Books of this &s;ubject, though they are plain and ea&s;ie for all Sea-men to under&s;tand, yet they are not &s;o exact and perfect in all things as they ought to be.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>Secondly; That though Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gunter,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Norwood,</HI> have very fully &s;hewed the errours of the fore&s;aid Books, and have very perfectly reformed them; yet their Books are not plain and u&s;efull for all men, be|cau&s;e they require much knowledge in Arithmetick.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Though there be many skilfull Sea-men, which are able to make u&s;e of the&s;e Authors; yet there are many others, who would willingly attain to a more perfect knowledge in this Art, and yet cannot, for want of Arithmetick. Now for the helpe of &s;uch as the&s;e e|&s;pecially, have I publi&s;hed this Book: wherein you &s;hall finde how all that which is to be performed by Arith|metick in the fore&s;aid Authors, may be &s;ufficiently ex|actly perform'd by Geometry with the Ruler and Com|pa&s;&s;es; &s;o that any one that can but read and write a lit|tle, though he have no skill in Arithmetick, may hereby attain a true and perfect knowledge of the Art of Navi|gation, &s;o that he &s;hall be able to keepe as true and cer|tain an account of his Voyage in any part of the World, as one that works by the mo&s;t exact rules of Arithme|tick. Nay, I dare &s;ay, that one that can neither write nor read, yet being of an ingenious capacity; and having one to teach him according to this way, may attain &s;ufficient skill in this Art.</P>
<P>Fourthly, This may al&s;o be u&s;efull to tho&s;e who can performe the&s;e things by Arithmetick, and the Doctrine of plain Triangles: For by this way they may perform them far more ea&s;ily and readily, and almo&s;t as exactly. And though &s;uch men may know many of the&s;e things already, yet perhaps they may gain &s;ome knowledge hereby.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, As by this way the knowledge of the Art is
<PB REF="3"> mo&s;t ea&s;ily and &s;peedily attained, &s;o it is more certainly and con&s;tantly retained and pre&s;erved, both in re&s;pect of the knowledge and practice thereof. Fir&s;t, the know|ledge hereof is more certainly retained in your memory: for this is the rea&s;on why all Authors are forced to make u&s;e of &s;ome Geometricall figures; partly to explain their Rules, and partly to fixe them in the memory, by ma|king them vi&s;ible to the eye; for we more &s;urely remem|ber any thing which we &s;ee done, then what we only hear. Now in this way, every thing is made much more vi&s;ible to the eye, and therefore more ea&s;ie both to learn and remember. Secondly, the practice of this know|ledge will be more &s;urely and con&s;tantly pre&s;erved: for Arithmeticall calculations require many Tables, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Sines, Tangents, Secants, Meridian,</HI> which cannot po&s;&s;i|bly be kept in memory; &s;o that if by any cro&s;s accident a Sea-man be deprived of his Books, he can make no u&s;e of his skill in Arithmetick. But if a man knowes how to performe the&s;e things by Geometry, though all his Books and Writings be lo&s;t, yet having but a plain Ruler and a pair of Compa&s;&s;es, he may quickly recover his lo&s;s, and fall to his work as before.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, I have adventured to pub|li&s;h this little Book, wherein I have briefely and plainly laid down the whole Art (as to the Geometricall part thereof) beginning at the fir&s;t principles, and pro|ceeding by degrees to the highe&s;t conclu&s;ions. I have u&s;ed the more figures to make every thing the plainer. And I have provided &s;uch figures, as &s;erve not only for demon&s;tration of the thing, but may &s;erve for In&s;tru|ments to work upon; or you may ea&s;ily, by the directi|ons given, make the like. To conclude, I have &s;tudyed
<PB REF="4"> to make tho&s;e things plaine&s;t, which have at any time mo&s;t troubled my &s;elfe to under&s;tand. So that I que&s;ti|on not but that any one that is indu&s;trious, may here of ea&s;ily and &s;peedily attain, &s;uch a competent mea&s;ure by knowledge in this Art, that by Gods ble&s;&s;ing upon his &s;tudy and labour therein, he may obtain much credit and profit. Which is all the de&s;ire, of</P>

<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION 9.</HI> To make one angle equall, or like to another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ninth <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI></NOTE></HEAD>
<P>AN angle is the ioyning or cro&s;&s;ing of two lines:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What an an|gle is, with the generall kinds of angles.</NOTE> if the two lines cro&s;&s;e one another, or joyn one to another perpendicularly, then they are &s;aid to make a right an|gle, or angles: if two lines meet or cro&s;&s;e one another any other way, they are &s;aid to make an oblique angle or angles.</P>
<P>Thus in the third figure, the lines D B and E B meeting in the point B, make a right angle. And in the &s;econd figure, the lines A B and G E, cro&s;&s;ing one another in the point C, make four right angles, or quadrants. But in the third figure, the lines E D and B D, meeting in the point D, are &s;aid to make an oblique angle. Now the&s;e oblique angles, if they be le&s;&s;e then a right angle, they are called acute or &s;harpe an|gles: if they be more then a right angle, they are called ob|tu&s;e or blunt angles.</P>
<P>Now for example of the propo&s;ition, let the angle E D B be the appointed angle, and it is required to make the angle D B C like unto it.</P>
<P>In this example, becau&s;e the line D B is limited, and is common to both the angles, you &s;hall need onely to &s;et one foot of your compa&s;&s;es in B, and open the other to the nee|re&s;t di&s;tance of the line D E, which you may do by drawing the little arch which toucheth the line between 3 and 4: then remove your compa&s;&s;es to D, and draw the like arch at C, then lay your Ruler to the point B, and the very edge of this arch C, and draw the line B C, &s;o &s;hall the two angles be of one quantity or widene&s;&s;e, as was de&s;ired.</P>
<P>In other ca&s;es this way will not &s;erve, but this is &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and I &s;hall &s;hew you other wayes to perform that in the next Chapter.</P>

<P>THe Longitude of places, is their di&s;tance Ea&s;t and We&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the longitude and latitude of a place is.</NOTE> The latitude of places, is their di&s;tance North and South. In the Globe, the longitude of places is accounted al|ways from the We&s;t, Ea&s;tward; &s;till increa&s;ing the number of degrees, untill they come to 360, which is the whole com|pa&s;&s;e of the Globe, &s;o that you come to the fir&s;t Meridian againe. This account of the Longitude may begin at any place, but Geographers do commonly begin to reckon it from one of the I&s;les of the <HI>Azores.</HI> But it is the be&s;t way for the Seamen, not much to regard this, but to reckon by the diffe|rence of longitude, or (which is all one) by the difference of the Meridians of the two places. The latitude of places is rec|kond by their di&s;tance from the Equinoctial toward either of the Poles, &s;o that it never exceeds 90 degrees. If the place lye between the Equinoctiall and the North pole, it is &s;aid to have North latitude. If it lye between the Equinoctiall, and the South Pole, it is &s;aid to have South latitude. Now though in &s;ome propo&s;itions, the Seaman reckons by the difference of latitude, yet in mo&s;t of his accounts and ob&s;ervations he doth reckon the latitude of places by their true di&s;tance from the Equinoctiall North or South.</P>

And here in the common rule is much out, which accounts 5 foot to a pace, and 1000 &s;uch pa|ces, that is 5000 feet to a mile, and 60 &s;uch miles, that is 300000 feet to a degree. Neither will the Engli&s;h mile which is &s;omewhat more then this &s;erve the turne, who&s;e length is thus by the Statute. 16 feet and a half make a pole, 40 poles make a furlong, and 8 furlongs, that is 5280 feet, make a mile: and &s;o 60 &s;uch miles do contain 316800 feet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Sea|mans Practice</NOTE> But Mr. <HI>Nor|wood,</HI> by mea&s;uring the way from <HI>Yorke</HI> to <HI>London</HI> found that a degree doth exactly containe 367200 Engli&s;h feet, and &s;hews how this experiment agrees with former experiments made by others, if rightly con&s;idered: however his experiment is &s;o full and punctuall, that it may well pa&s;&s;e for currant, rather then any others which differ from it.</P>
<P>Now by this reckoning, if one degree contain 367200 feet, then the tenth part of a degree doth contain 36720 feet, and the hundreth part of a degree doth contain 3672 feet. Thus you &s;hall know the true di&s;tance of places, knowing how ma|ny degrees and parts they are a&s;under.</P>
<P>And the knowledge hereof is very con&s;iderable in the keep|ing of your dead reckoning by the Log-line,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How your log-line ought to be marked,</NOTE> which you &s;hall doe well to rectifie according to this experiment thus. If you keep your account by an half minute gla&s;&s;e, then at every 30 feet length of your line, you mu&s;t make a knot: and then &s;o
<PB N="21" REF="15"> many of tho&s;e knots as you veer out in half a minute, &s;o many 100 parts of a degree the &s;hip runs in an hour. As if you veer but one knot while the halfe minute gla&s;&s;e is running, then the &s;hip runs but 1/100, that is one hundreth part of a de|gree in an hower, if you veer 2 knots, then the &s;hip runs 2/100 parts of a degree, and &s;o if you veer 10 of tho&s;e knots in half a minute, then the &s;hip runs 20/100 or one tenth part of a degree in an hour. If the gla&s;&s;e be out not ju&s;t at a knot, then for every 3 feet from the la&s;t knot you may count a tenth part of an hundreth part more.</P>
<P>And though by this reckoning there be but 360000 feet, al|lowed to a degree, whereas there &s;hould be 367200, the&s;e 7200 feet are thought fit to be abated, not onely in regard of the ro|tundity of the number, to avoid fractions but for the&s;e con&s;i|derations. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e though he that veers the line be never &s;o careful not to over-hale it, yet the log will be drawn thereby &s;omewhat after the &s;hip. Secondly, the Eddy which the &s;hip makes, is &s;ubject to draw the log &s;omewhat after it; or at lea&s;t &s;o to dead the water, that it will &s;omewhat hinder the motion of the log. Thirdly, the wind and waves beating after the &s;hip will drive the log &s;omewhat forwarder then it &s;hould be. For the&s;e cau&s;es, the way of the &s;hip may very well be &s;omewhat more then the log line &s;hews for. Be&s;ides if this were not &s;o, yet it is the be&s;t way to have your reckoning run &s;omewhat be|fore your &s;hip, that &s;o you may not fall upon a place before you are aware of it.</P>

And then they help in the drawing rumbe lines, from any point. Whereas to draw &s;o many rumbes after the u&s;uall manner, is but a &s;pending much time and labour to little purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> Shewing how to make a Sea-chart for any part of the World, which &s;hall agree in all particulars with the Globe; with &s;everall Propo&s;itions &s;hew|ing the manner of u&s;ing it.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The defects of the plain Chart.</NOTE>_THe way of &s;ayling by the plain chart, is very ea|&s;ie to under&s;tand, as you may &s;ee by what hath been &s;aid in the former chapter: But it hath this inconvenience, that it is fit to be u&s;ed onely in places neer the Equinoctiall, or in &s;ome &s;hort voyages. For it &s;uppo&s;eth the degrees of Lon|gitude to be all of one length, in every Latitude, and there|fore it makes the degrees both of longitude and latitude, all of one length and breadth in all places. But you mu&s;t know that though the degrees of Latitude, are alwayes of one and the &s;ame breadth (<HI>viz.</HI> about twenty leagues) yet the de|grees of longitude are not all of this length, but as you may &s;ee in the Globe, they grow le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e toward the Poles: &s;o that though about the Equinoctiall, a de|gree of longitude is equall to a degree of latitude, <HI>viz.</HI> about 20 leagues: yet in the latitude of 60 deg. one degree of longi|tude is equall, but to half a degree of latitude, <HI>viz.</HI> about 10 leagues; and about the latitude of 75 deg. 30&prime;, one degree of longitude is equall but to a quarter of a degree of latitude, which is about 5 leagues. And therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et three places upon the plain chart, which differ much in longi|tude and latitude, as they ought to be placed, that is according to their places on the Globe. But if you &s;et them down, accor|ding to their longitudes and latitudes; then they will not &s;tand in their true Rumbes and Di&s;tances one from the other: and if you &s;trive to &s;et them down according to their Rumbes and Di&s;tances; then their Longitudes and Latitudes will not fail out right.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="20">
<P>And therefore though you may make a &s;hift to performe &s;ome &s;hort voyages by it, yet you cannot u&s;e it in any long voyage without great errour: except you onely goe from one place to another, and &s;o directly back again to the &s;ame place, from whence you came, and by the &s;ame cour&s;e which you came.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This example is M. <HI>Norwoods</HI> in his Pro|blemes of &s;ayl|ing.</NOTE> For example, &s;uppo&s;e you were to &s;ail from the <HI>Lyzard,</HI> to the <HI>Summer I&s;lands,</HI> and &s;hould according to the common cour&s;e fir&s;t &s;ail <HI>South-we&s;t,</HI> about 500 leagues, and then fin|ding your &s;elf to be in the latitude of 32 deg. 20&prime;, you &s;hould then &s;ail full <HI>We&s;t</HI> 782 leagues, and then you &s;hould finde your &s;elfe directly South from the <HI>Summer Ilands,</HI> and about 2 leagues off them. Now by this reckoning upon the plain chart, the&s;e I&s;lands &s;hould be di&s;tant from the <HI>Lyzard,</HI> 1189 leagues. Now admitting this reckoning outward to be true, and the&s;e places to be thus &s;cituated upon the plain chart, let us &s;uppo&s;e the reckoning homewards to be al&s;o kept upon the plain chart. And becau&s;e in comming home, men keep to the Northwards, &s;uppo&s;e that you &s;teer away fir&s;t <HI>N E</HI> half a point Ea&s;terly 200 leagues; then <HI>N E by E</HI> 100 leagues, next <HI>E N E</HI> half a point northerly 165 leagues; then <HI>E N E</HI> 130 leagues; then <HI>E N E</HI> halfe a point Ea&s;terly 88 leagues, then <HI>E by N</HI> 70 leagues; la&s;tly, <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> 317 leagues; if you &s;et down this reckoning upon the plain chart, you will be yet &s;hort of the <HI>Lyzard</HI> about 160 leagues, whereas you are already come unto the <HI>Lyzard,</HI> and &s;o you will finde it, if you keep your rec|koning by this following Sea-chart.</P>
<P>For the reformation hereof, Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> in his book of the <HI>Errours of Navigation,</HI> hath &s;hewed how to make, and hath al&s;o made a table, by the continuall addition of the &s;ecants of every minute, which &s;hews how much you are to lengthen the degrees of latitude in your Map, that &s;o there may be a true proportion between the degrees of Longitude and Lati|tude in all places: which table Mr. <HI>Gunter</HI> hath abridged, and made it more plain and ea&s;ie, by reducing it into decimall parts. I &s;hall here &s;hew you how to do the &s;ame by <HI>Geometry,</HI> and how to make a line of Latitudes, or a Meridian line an|&s;werable to any line of longitudes.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The projecti|on of the Me|ridi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n Line.</NOTE>Fir&s;t, make the Quadrants A B C of what largnes you plea&s;e, and divide the limbe thereof into 90 degrees numbring them from B towards C, then divide the &s;ide of the Qua|drant A B into 10 equall parts, and draw &s;traight lines from them parallel to A C, then take one of the&s;e parts from A to E, and &s;ubdivide it into 10 le&s;&s;er parts, and draw lines from them parallel unto A C. Now you mu&s;t note that the length of this one part A C is to be your radius, or the mea&s;ure of one degree of longitude in your Chart, &s;o that the whole line A B will be 10 degrees, and becau&s;e the&s;e degrees of longitude are to be of one length in all latitudes, therefore the degrees of la|titude mu&s;t increa&s;e as the &s;ecants of the latitudes increa&s;e. Therefore if you would know how long one degree of latitude mu&s;t be in the latitude of 30 deg. lay your ruler to the center A, and the arch of the quadrant at 30 deg. and draw the line A G, now the radius being A E, this line A G is the &s;ecant of 30 deg. to that radius, and mu&s;t be the length of one degree of latitude in a Chart for that latitude. So likewi&s;e the line A H which is the &s;ecant of 45 deg. to that radius, mu&s;t be the length of one degree of latitude, in the latitude of 45 deg. and &s;o for any other latitude: and note that the 10 intermedi|ate lines may &s;erve to divide each of the&s;e degrees into 10 parts.</P>
<P>If you would examine the truth of this projection how it agrees with the Globe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proof of of this proje|ction.</NOTE> whereas in the Globe one degree of latitude is equall to two degrees of longitude in the latitude of 60 deg: &s;o here A K the &s;ecant of 60 deg. is twice the length of A E the mea&s;ure of one degree of longitude, and whereas in the Globe one degree of latitude is equall to foure degrees of longitude in the latitude of 75 deg. 30&prime;: &s;o here A L the &s;ecant of 75 deg. 30&prime; is four times the length of A E, and &s;o the proportion will hold in any other latitude.</P>
<P>If you de&s;ire to make a table hereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To make a Ta|ble of the Me|ridian line.</NOTE> then you may make the whole line A B to be your radius, or the length of one degree, which you may divide into 100 parts, and then the &s;ecants will be the lines drawn from the center A to the line B D, thus then the line A I will be the &s;ecant of 30 degrees,
<PB N="34" REF="22"> who&s;e length is 115, as you may mea&s;ure in the &s;cale A B if it were increa&s;ed. And &s;o the line A D is the &s;ecant of 45 degr. who&s;e length is 141.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> * And note here if you make the table for whole degrees only, then it wil be the be&s;t way to draw the Se|cant line through the mid&s;t of the degree, as if you would know the length of the line which mu&s;t reach from 29 degrees to 30 degrees, draw the line through 29 degrees 30 minutes, the length wherof will be 115, and &s;o by the continuall addition of the&s;e Secants you may make the Table following, which you &s;hall finde agrees very well with Ma&s;ter <HI>Gunters,</HI> only his radius is divided into 1000 parts and this but into 100.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way to make a Me|ridian line.</NOTE>Al&s;o by the Quadrant, or the Table, you may make the two Meridian lines following. But if you make them by the Quadrant, then becau&s;e the degrees would fall too clo&s;e toge|ther if they were all drawn, under the fir&s;t Radius A E, you may remove the Radius A E further from the center, and then draw them under it. As for example, the di&s;tance between the lines 8 and 9 being equall to the di&s;tance A E, you may there draw the fir&s;t 20 degrees. Then between the lines 7 and 8 be|ing of the like di&s;tance, draw the next ten degrees which is to 30, and &s;o do the re&s;t as you &s;ee in the Quadrant. Then taking out the&s;e degrees one by one with your compa&s;&s;es, &s;et them upon the Meridian line, of your Chart, or make a Meridian line, at your lea&s;ure, as in the following figure, which will be very ready upon any occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>I have made here two meridian lines and that for two rea|&s;ons. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e in the larger line after 80 degrees of lati|tude, the degrees grew &s;o large, and increa&s;ed &s;o much, that it would be both needle&s;&s;e and trouble&s;ome to make any u&s;e of them: but the chief rea&s;on is this. Becau&s;e when you are to goe any long voyage, it wil be needfull for you fir&s;t to make a generall Map of your whole voyage by the le&s;&s;er line, where|by you may know the cour&s;e and di&s;tance thereof in generall: and then to make three or four other charts by the greater line upon which, with your ruler and compa&s;&s;es you may &s;et down your dayly cour&s;es and di&s;tances more exactly.</P>
<P>Al&s;o I have made the&s;e two lines in &s;uch proportion, that the one is the tenth part of the other, that &s;o that they may both agree with the &s;cale upon the Quadrant.</P>
<P>Now the way to make one of the&s;e charts is very ea&s;ie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To make a Sea Chart by the&s;e Meridian lines.</NOTE> and much after the manner of the plain chart. For fir&s;t, you may draw the line of Ea&s;t and We&s;t A B of what length you plea&s;e, and divide it into equall parts or degrees, then you may erect a perpendicular line either at one of the ends of the line or in any of the divi&s;ions toward the mid&s;t of the line, and then draw the other parallels of longitude parallel thereto, &s;o far it is all one with the plain chart, but when you come to draw the parallels of latitude, you mu&s;t not make them all equall, (though they mu&s;t be all parallel) each to other; but you mu&s;t either with your compa&s;&s;es, take them out of the Qua|drant, or which is more ea&s;ie, lay a &s;croule of paper to the Meridian line which is ready drawn to your hand, and &s;o mark out the degrees of latitude upon the &s;croule of paper, and then laying that &s;croule to the &s;ides of your chart, you may tran&s;|ferre the degrees of latitude into the &s;ides of your chart, and through them draw the parallels, and &s;et fit numbers to them, as in the figure.</P>

<P>Now though this be not a general chart of the whole globe, yet it may be called a generall chart in re&s;pect of others, which wil &s;erve onely for a le&s;&s;er portion of the Globe.

<P>As in this example, if you take the di&s;tance S L in your com|pa&s;&s;es, and mea&s;ure it &s;o in the Meridian line, it wil reach from about 16 degrees, to about 66 degree and an halfe, that is 16 degrees and an half above 50 degrees, the greater latitude, and 16 degrees and an halfe below 32 degrees, 25 minutes, the le&s;&s;er latitude, and &s;o the degrees intercepted between the points of the compa&s;&s;es are about 50 degrees and a half, whereas the di&s;tance of the two places is almo&s;t 55 degrees.</P>
<P>But you &s;hall finde the di&s;tance more exactly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way to mea&s;ure the di&s;tances of places which differ in longi|tude and lati|tude.</NOTE> if you doe thus. Fir&s;t, divide the &s;pace that is in the meridian line be|tween the two latitudes into two equall parts, which in this Example will fall at 42 degrees, then take with your compa&s;|&s;es halfe the length of the line L S, which is L M, and &s;etting one foot of the compa&s;&s;es in 42 degrees, which is the middle point between the two latitudes, you &s;hall finde that the other point will reach down to 8 degrees and a halfe, then keeping the one foot &s;till fixed in 42 degrees, turne the other foot up|ward, and it will reach to 63 degrees and a half; now the degrees of the meridian line between the&s;e two points are 55, which is the di&s;tance de&s;ired, which is 550 double leagues or tenths of a degree, or 1100 leagues. But if this di&s;tance were to be mea&s;ured in the plain chart, the two places being &s;et down therein according to their longitudes and latitudes a|fore&s;aid, their di&s;tance would be above 72 degrees, which is 340 leagues, more then the truth.</P>
<P>If you would mea&s;ure a parallel di&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to mea|&s;ure the di&s;t|ance of places which differ only in longi|tude.</NOTE> as &s;uppo&s;e the two places were L and T, both in the latitude of 50 degrees, and their difference of Longitude is 70, the way will be to take halfe the di&s;tance which is L Q, with your compa&s;&s;es, and &s;et|ting one foot in 50 degrees of the meridian line, the other foot will reach to 22 degrees and a half downwards, and to 67 de|grees and a half upward, and if you count the degrees between
<PB N="42" REF="26"> the&s;e two places, or el&s;e &s;ub&s;tract the le&s;&s;er from the greater, you &s;hall finde 45 deg. which is the di&s;tance of the two places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way to mea&s;ure the di&s;tances of parallel places</NOTE>Yet this may more readily be performed by the Quadrant, <HI>Page</HI> 22, whereby the meridian line was made.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, if you would mea&s;ure a parallel di&s;tance, as for exam|ple, &s;uppo&s;e you would mea&s;ure the di&s;tance of the two pla|ces T and L, being both in the latitude of 50 degrees, and their difference of longitude is 70 degrees.

<P>Now to know this exactly, the&s;e greater parts &s;hould each of them be divided with lines into ten parts, as the fir&s;t of them is: or el&s;e you may make u&s;e of tho&s;e lines in the fir&s;t part thus.

<P>But if you would mea&s;ure the di&s;tance of two places which differ both in latitude and longitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To mea&s;ure the di&s;tance of places which differ in lon|gitude and la|titude.</NOTE> as the two places L and S in the chart, you mu&s;t do thus Fir&s;t, draw the line AM in the quadrant, <HI>pag.</HI> 32, by the arch of the one latitude 32 degrees 25 minutes, then draw the line A P 50, by the arch of the other latitude, 50 degrees, then in any of the parallel lines, divide the &s;pace between the&s;e two lines A M and A P 50 into two equal parts, which if you do in the eighth parallel, the halfe or mid&s;t wil be at N,, then draw the line A N, which wil be your &s;cale to mea&s;ure this di&s;tance by.

But this as &s;aid, is but the lea&s;t part of the benefit that comes by this vvay of &s;ayling: the chiefe&s;t is this, that in &s;ayling between two &s;uch places by the arch of a great circle, you wil fir&s;t in the one half of the way rai&s;e the Pole 5 degrees 69/100, and then in the other half depre&s;s the Pole as much, &s;o that in your whole Voyage you wil alter the latitude 11 degrees 38/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">0, &amp; &s;o by the ob&s;ervation of the latitude you may rectifie your dead recko|ning very wel, which you cannot do, &s;ayling in the parallel. Thus you &s;ee this way of &s;ayling is not only the neere&s;t but the be&s;t way.</P>
<P>Now concerning this way of &s;ayling, there hath been but little written by any,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Few have written of this &s;ubject.</NOTE> and therefore I &s;hal be the more large in this. Captain <HI>Salton&s;tall</HI> in his Booke called the <HI>Navigator,</HI> hath &s;aid &s;omwhat how to direct a parallel cour&s;e, but for any other cour&s;e he hath &s;aid nothing, and what hee &s;heweth is to be performed by Arithmetick. Ma&s;ter <HI>Norwood</HI> in his Book of <HI>Trigonometry,</HI> hath added as an appendix many Problemes of Sayling by the arch of a great circle whereby tho&s;e; who both can, and wil take the pains, may by calculation finde out all things nece&s;&s;ary in this way of Sayling. But tho&s;e ways of cal|culation as they are very difficult to the unlearned, &s;o they are tedious to tho&s;e that have the be&s;t skil: and therefore I hope it will be wel accepted, if I here &s;hew you how the &s;ame may be performed by <HI>Geometry,</HI> both plainly and &s;peedily, and yet with as much exactne&s;&s;e, as need be required.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="30">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chiefe things to be known.</NOTE>And in the pur&s;uance hereof, I &s;hal keep as clo&s;e to Ma&s;ter <HI>Norwood,</HI> as I can, both in his Propo&s;itions and Examples, that thereby you may &s;ee how neerly my plain lines wil approach to the exactne&s;&s;e of his calculations. Now if you ob&s;erve him, there are the&s;e three things, which mu&s;t be found out in every Example. Fir&s;t, the di&s;tance of the two places in the arch of a great Circle. Secondly, the angle of po&s;ition from the one place to the other. Thirdly, to finde out what longitudes and latitudes the arch of the great circle doth pa&s;&s;e through be|tween the two places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To finde the di&s;tance of two places.</NOTE>For the fir&s;t of the&s;e, knowing the longitude and latitude of two places, to finde their di&s;tance in the arch of a great cir|cle, which is always the neere&s;t di&s;tance. I might &s;hew you how to perform this in the fir&s;t place, but I here pa&s;&s;e it by for the&s;e rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e Ma&s;ter <HI>Wright,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Blundevile,</HI> and Captain <HI>Salton&s;tall,</HI> have all of them demon&s;trated it in their Books already. And &s;econdly, becau&s;e the chief benefit in this way of &s;ailing doth not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in &s;aving of a litle way, as in &s;ayling the mo&s;t convenient way: that is, &s;o as you may alter your latitude mo&s;t, and &s;o your reckoning may be the more certain. For though neer the Poles, the difference of the di&s;tance of two places, in the arch of a great circle, and in their rumbe, may be con&s;iderable; yet in mo&s;t Voyages it is not: as in the forenamed Example of two places in the pa|rallel of 40 degrees, the difference by calculation is found to be but one degree 54/100, which is &s;carce con&s;iderable in the whole Voyage, being 52 degrees. Thirdly, it wil be &s;omewhat difficult, &amp; it requires great curio&s;ity in drawing of tho&s;e lines pre&s;cribed by them &s;o exactly, that you may come to the know+ledge of the di&s;tance any thing neer. La&s;tly, all that trouble is needle&s;&s;e. For though in calculation this di&s;tance mu&s;t be found out fir&s;t, that &s;o you may find out the re&s;t of the Propo|&s;itions following: yet in this way I am about to &s;hew that which follows, no way depends upon the true knowledge of this di&s;tance: it &s;hal be &s;ufficient therefore for the pre&s;ent, to tel you, that this way is always &s;omewhat the neere&s;t way.</P>
<P>For the &s;econd of the&s;e Propo&s;itions, which is to know the
<PB N="51" REF="30"> angle of po&s;ition from the one place to the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The angle of po&s;ition is needle&s;s in this operation.</NOTE> Though this mu&s;t be found out in calculation before you can proceed any further, yet in this work it is more needle&s;&s;e then the former propo&s;ition, and therefore may be very well omitted.</P>
<P>But now for the third Propo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To finde out the longitudes and latitudes by which the great circle doth pa&s;s.</NOTE> which is the finding out by what Longitudes and Latitudes the great circle mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e between the two places, this being the very end aimed at in all the work, may be thus attained.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, draw the following Quadrant A D B, and divide it into degrees; then con&s;ider of what length your Tangent line mu&s;t be, and accordingly &s;et off your Radius from A to|ward D the larger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">You may make your tangent larger either by ma|king your Quadrant lar|ger, or by &s;et|ting your Ra|dius further from the Cen|ter, Thus in the Quadrant the line D K is a larger tan|gent line, which though it reach but to 45 degrees, yet by lengthe|ning of the line, you may &s;et on the re&s;t.</NOTE> the better, but in this Quadrant, the Ra|dius is A R) and this Radius is always a tangent of 45 degrees. Then from the point R, draw the line R T parallel to the &s;ide of the Quadrant A B: this line R T is the Tangent line which you mu&s;t divide into degrees, as you &s;ee in the figure by drawing &s;traight lines from the Center A to the limbe of the Quadrant. Then transferre this line to the &s;ides of the Quadrant A B and A D, and then &s;etting one foot of your compa&s;&s;es in the center A, open the other to the &s;everall de|grees in the line A B or A D and draw the arches.

<P>Note if you draw lines by every degree of longitude in the blanck Map, as there is by every degree of latitude, you may then finde out the latitude of the great circle for every degree of longitude. But this paines wil be needle&s;&s;e, yet the lines may be for &s;ome u&s;e, for if your two places differ more in la|titude then they do in longitude, then it will be your better way to &s;et down by what longitudes the great circle doth pa&s;s at every fourth or fift degree of latitude.</P>
<P>Now that the longitudes and latitudes of a great circle thus

<P>Having &s;poken before the calculation hereof: but notwith|&s;tanding all that hath hitherto been &s;aid, it may &s;eem hard to direct a &s;hip, and to keep &s;uch a rekoning as may be agreeable to this method of &s;ailing. And indeed as it is in a manner im|po&s;&s;ible, &s;o neither is it nece&s;&s;ary that a &s;hip &s;hould alwayes per&s;evere exactly in the arch of a great circle. It may &s;uffice, and it is almo&s;t the &s;ame in effect, if a &s;hip be &s;o directed that &s;hee go neer this arch.

Then prick down in this chart the latitudes through which the arch of the great circle doth pa&s;&s;e at every tenth degree of longitude Then if your chart be of the le&s;&s;er &s;ize, you may with your compa&s;&s;es draw an arch of a circle through tho&s;e pricks, and this arch will repre&s;ent the great circle between the two places. But if your chart be of the larger &s;ize, and &s;o your compa&s;&s;es be not large enough, to draw this circle; or el&s;e you are forced in regard of the length of the voyage to make two or three charts for it, then you may prick down the lon|gitudes and latitudes of the great circle for every fift degree of longitude, and with your ruler, draw little &s;traight lines from one prick to another, and yet the&s;e lines wil repre&s;ent the great circle wel enough.

<P>_HAving &s;hewed you how to &s;ail, either by the Rumbe that leads from one place to another, or el&s;e by an arch of a great circle extended be|tween two places, I &s;hal now lay down &s;ome ob&s;ervations, which may be u&s;efull in either of the&s;e wayes of &s;ayling, for &s;ometimes it is be&s;t to u&s;e the one way, &s;ometimes the other, in &s;ome voyages it is be&s;t to &s;ail by the Rumbe, in &s;ome voyages it is be&s;t to &s;ail by the arch, in &s;ome voyages it is the be&s;t way to u&s;e both, and to keep neither to the rumbe nor to the arch exactly.</P>
<P>In voyages to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> though the neere&s;t way, be by the arch of a great circle; and though the way by the di|rect Rumbe, lies very wel: yet it is u&s;ual in the&s;e voyages to &s;teer wide from both the&s;e neerer ways, <HI>viz</HI> fir&s;t, to &s;teer much more to the Southward then the cour&s;e lies, until they come into the latitude of the place, and then to run their cour&s;e We&s;t, until they arrive at their de&s;ired port. And this way is very good, e&s;pecially when you &s;ail unto a little lone I&s;land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To get the be|nefit of the winde.</NOTE> For fir&s;t, by &s;ayling toward the Line, you &s;hal gain the bene|fit of the <HI>Tradewind</HI> (as they call it) which doth mo&s;t con|&s;tantly blow between the North and Ea&s;t, between and neer the <HI>Tropicks.</HI> Secondly, hereby you may be &s;ure not to over|&s;hoot the I&s;land you would &s;ayl to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To avoyd over|&s;hooting the place you go to</NOTE> which otherwayes may ea&s;ily be done. For it is an hard matter in a long voyage, to &s;teer your cour&s;es &s;o exactly, and keep your account of your way &s;o perfectly, as not to mi&s;&s;e &s;ome few leagues: and be|&s;ide
<PB N="66" REF="38"> if this could be done, yet the cour&s;es and di&s;tances can not be &s;o exactly known, becau&s;e the true longitudes of places one in re&s;pect of another is not &s;o exactly found out, as is to be wi&s;hed for. And if by either of the&s;e cau&s;es, when you &s;hall come to the end of your reckoning, you &s;hal chance not to be in &s;ight of the I&s;land, you wil then be at &s;uch a lo&s;&s;e, that you wil not know which way to &s;ail to finde it, whether Ea&s;tward, or We&s;tward, and &s;o mu&s;t be forced to vvander at randome untill you have a &s;ight of &s;ome knovvn place, by which you may knovv hovv the I&s;land bears from you. Therefore in &s;ay|ling to &s;uch a place as this; it is the be&s;t vvay to be &s;ure to get into the latitude of the place, a good while before you come to it, and then &s;ayling neer that latitude, you &s;hall be &s;ure not to pa&s;&s;e by it without a &s;ight of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 To get a wind.</NOTE>In voyages from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the u&s;ual way is fir&s;t to &s;ail much more northerly, then the true Rumbe doth lie, and this likewi&s;e is to get the benefit of the wind, for as the winde lies mo&s;t Ea&s;terly toward the Equinoctial, &s;o it blows mo&s;t we&s;terly towards the Pole: al&s;o this way is the neere&s;t way, becau&s;e it lies neer the arch of a great circle. But many Sea|men not knowing &s;o much, and e&s;pecially keeping their rec|koning upon the plain chart, this convenience might prove an inconvenience to them for they are many times at their jour|neys end 150 or 200 leagues before they are aware, and &s;o might ea&s;ily over&s;hoot their port, and lo&s;e them&s;elves, but that they &s;ail to the maine land, or great I&s;lands that they can|not pa&s;&s;e by.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3 The inconve|nience of &s;ai|ling in a pa|rallel.</NOTE>Now as for the&s;e cau&s;es you &s;ometimes &s;tray from the rumb or arch which lies between the two places, &s;o there is another con&s;ideration which may be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for a little wan|dring, &s;ometimes out of the way, and that is the inconveni|ence that there is, in &s;ayling far upon a cour&s;e of Ea&s;t or We&s;t. Becau&s;e you mu&s;t always depend upon your dead reckoning which is &s;ubject to much mi&s;take, having no way to correct it by ob&s;ervation. This parallel &s;ayling makes the journey many times &s;eem tedious. As a man that travails in an unknown way, thinks the miles and the way to be longer then indeed they are,
<PB N="67" REF="38"> whereas he that knows the road and how farre it is from place to place, goes on more chearfully. Therefore the labour wil not be lo&s;t if you go &s;ometimes a little out of your way for this con&s;ideration, that &s;o you may have the more certainty of your account.</P>
<P>Indeed the way of &s;ailing by the arch of a great circle doth very much help in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to avoid &s;ailing in a parallel, partly.</NOTE> as I have &s;hewed at large in the for|mer Chapter, but yet if you keep your &s;elf in your yoyage too &s;trictly to the arch, you mu&s;t runne much of your way in a pa|rallel, or very neer it. As in the example of the parallel voy|age in the la&s;t chapter, the difference of longitude between the two places being 70 degrees, if you keep to the arch, you mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ail <HI>E N E,</HI> til you alter your longitude 5 degrees, then halfe a point more Ea&s;terly, til you alter your longitude 10 degrees more, then you mu&s;t &s;ail <HI>N by E</HI> til you alter your longitude 10 degrees more, that is in all 25 degrees, but af|terward the 7 degrees which are &s;et down half a point off the Ea&s;t, and the three degrees ful Ea&s;t, is little better then a pa|rallel cour&s;e: then again this being the middle point of your voyage, you mu&s;t &s;ail 10 degrees more in the &s;ame proportio|nal cour&s;e, &s;o that of the 70 degrees of the whole voyage you mu&s;t &s;ail 20 of them neer the cour&s;e of Ea&s;t and We&s;t.</P>
<P>Now you &s;hal &s;ee how ea&s;ily this may be avoyded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to avoid &s;ailing in a pa|rallel, totally.</NOTE> and that &s;everal wayes: fir&s;t let the cour&s;es be continued as before til you come to 25 degrees difference of longitude, which is at <HI>e</HI> in the la&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page 63.</NOTE> chart, then if at this point you leave the great cir|cle a little, and keep on your cour&s;e &s;til upon the 7 rumbe <HI>N by E,</HI> til you come to 35 degrees of longitude, your latitude wil be 46 degrees, 36 minutes, or 60 parts, differing from the latitude of the arch 55 minutes, but your di&s;tance for the&s;e 10 degrees of longitude wil be but 7 degrees 09/100, that is but 7/100, more then the other way, which makes but 4 miles, which makes 4 miles, which is &s;o little that it is not to be regarded in re&s;pect of the di&s;tance in the&s;e 10 degrees, being 425 miles.</P>
<P>Again if you begin &s;ooner to &s;werve from the arch, yet the difference of your way wil not be much, as you may &s;ee by this table which differs much from the other in the rumbes,
<PB N="68" REF="39"> latitudes, and longitudes, but yet it differs but little in the to|tal &s;umme of the di&s;tances, being but 20/100, which is but 12 miles.</P>

Then if from this point you alter your cour&s;e, and &s;ail upon the 6 rumbe Southward, again, <HI>E S E</HI> to <HI>P,</HI> your di&s;tance wil be as before 26 degrees 63/100, and &s;o you wil come to the latitude of 40 again, being the place you de&s;ire, &s;o that your whole voyage by this reckoning wil be but 53 degrees 26/100, w^c^h though it be &s;omewhat more then the di&s;tance by the arch, which is 52 degrees, 08/100, yet it is le&s;&s;e then the di&s;tance of the&s;e two places, in the parallel which is 53 degrees, 62/100, and the lo&s;&s;e of the way wil be wel recompen&s;ed, e&s;pecially in &s;ailing from the <HI>Indies,</HI> by the advantage of the wind, and by the certainty you may keep off your account, &s;ayling alwayes upon the &s;ixt rumbe.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="39">
<P>By this al&s;o it appears, that the longitudes and latitudes of the arch of a great circle, and the cour&s;es and di&s;tances which you are to &s;ail upon, in tracing thereof, may be &s;ufficiently found out in the tracing thereof, may be &s;ufficiently found out by the wayes before &s;hewed, &s;o that there needs no other cal|culation for them, &s;ince a &s;mal wandring from them, will not alter the length of the way in any con&s;iderable quantity.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o you may ea&s;ily avoid &s;ayling upon a cour&s;e of Ea&s;t &amp; We&s;t. Which way &s;oever your voiage lies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To avoyd &s;ail|ing Ea&s;t or We&s;t at any time.</NOTE> it wil be your be&s;t way to &s;teer no neerer to the Ea&s;t or We&s;t, then the 7^t^h rumbe from the meridian. For &s;o you may by your ob&s;ervation of the latitude, correct your account which otherwi&s;e you cannot do, and in doing thus, you vvil not go much out of your vvay. For &s;uppo&s;e you vvere to &s;ail betvveen tvvo places, under the E|quinoctial line, &s;o that the direct and neere&s;t way between the&s;e two places, lies ful Ea&s;t and We&s;t, yet you may &s;ayl be|tween the&s;e two places upon the &s;eventh Rumbe, and go not much out of your way. For example, let the two places be di|&s;tant 10 degrees, if you fir&s;t &s;ail the one half of your way up|on the 7 Rumbe, that is till you have altered your longitude 5 degrees, you wil rai&s;e the Pole very neer one degree, <HI>viz.</HI> 994/1000, and your di&s;tance or way &s;ayled will be but 5 degrees, 1/10 almo&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> 5 degrees, 098/1000. Then if you alter your cour&s;e, and &s;o lay the pole as much upon the 7 Rumbe the other way; &s;o you wil come to the place de&s;ired, having run the &s;ame di|&s;tance as before: thus in a voyage of 10 degrees, or 100 tenths or double leagues, you go not fully 2 tenths out of your way, which is not one in 50, which wil be wel recompen&s;ed, becau&s;e in &s;ailing thus upon the 7 Rumbe, you may by the ob&s;ervation of the latitude correct your account. For this rumbe rai&s;eth or depre&s;&s;e the Pole almo&s;t one degree in &s;ayling of five, which wil &s;erve very wel to correct your account by, and therefore I wil not per&s;wade you to go any further, out of your way. And if you direct your cour&s;e according to this rule, this is the far|the&s;t that you need go out of the way. For in all other places, the arch of the great circle, w^c^h is the neere&s;t way between two places, doth always lie &s;omewhat between the Pole, and the
<PB N="70" REF="40" MS="y"> parallel of Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and therefore in rai&s;ing the Pole upon the 7 Rumbe, you wil not go altogether &s;o much out of your way, if you ob&s;erve to incline your cour&s;e alwayes to|ward the Pole. Thus you &s;ee you need not &s;ayl directly Ea&s;t or We&s;t at any time unle&s;&s;e it be when you feare you &s;hal pa&s;s by &s;ome little lone I&s;land, as is afore&s;aid.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Make u&s;e of the Sea chart and the Map, or Globe <HI>in plano, pag.</HI> 52. both together.</NOTE>In voyages neer the Pole it is be&s;t to guide your &s;elf as neer the arch of the great circle as you can, having re&s;pect to the former con&s;iderations. And in the&s;e voyages your be&s;t way wil be to keep your reckonings, both upon the Chart and up|oe the Map, &s;o the one wil help the defects of the other. As for example, the Rumbes from one place to another, are ea&s;i|e&s;t to be found out upon the chart, but the di&s;tances of the pla|ces, and the arch between them wil be found out more ea&s;ily by the Map. For the places being &s;et upon it according to their longitudes and latitudes, wil be more compo&s;ed and hold bet|ter conformity to the Globe, being in a manner the &s;ame with it, e&s;pecially within 10 or 20 degrees from the Pole. Thus then if you are to &s;ail upon di&s;covery, and not to a certain place, your be&s;t way wil be; by the rumbe which you &s;ail upon, and by the latitude which you finde by ob&s;ervation, to finde out the longitude of the place you are in at any time by the chart, and then &s;etting down this place, according to its lon|gitude and latitude thus found out, upon the Map, you may more readily &s;ee its di&s;tance and po&s;ition from any other place. But if you are to &s;ail to a certain place, who&s;e longitude and latitude is known, then it wil be be&s;t, to &s;et the place down fir&s;t in the Map, and &s;o to finde out the longitudes and lati|tudes of the great circle between them, which being pricked down upon the chart, you may &s;ee how to &s;teer your cour&s;es to the place appointed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5 To find out if there be any current.</NOTE>In all your voyages it wil be a good way to keep your ac|counts upon two blanck charts, upon the one, you may keep your dead reckoning, upon the other, your corrected account. And the benefit hereof wil be this: if you be careful to keep your dead reckoning outward, and homewards true, you may thereby whether there be any current between the two places,
<PB N="71" REF="40"> and which way that current &s;ets, and how fa&s;t it runnes. For if there be a current between the places you &s;ail to, which way &s;oever the current &s;ets, your reckonings outward and home|ward wil not agree, and indeed you can keepe no good ac|count of your way, til you know which way and how fa&s;t the current runnes.</P>
<P>For example: fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;e the current runnes Ea&s;t 12 miles a day, and you &s;ayl again&s;t this current according to your account, by your Log-line (which is the be&s;t mea&s;ure of your dead reckoning) 60 miles We&s;t in a day, your true pace or di&s;tance wil be but 48 miles in a day, becau&s;e the current wil &s;et you back 12 miles, which &s;ub&s;tracted from 60, there remains but 48. On the contrary, if you &s;ayl Ea&s;tward in this current, (and &s;o &s;ayl with it) 60 miles a day according to your log-line, then your true motion wil be 72 miles a day, becau&s;e the current wil &s;et you forward 12 miles more then you &s;eem to goe.</P>
<P>Secondly, &s;uppo&s;e the current run Ea&s;t one mile an hour, if you &s;ayl in this current <HI>N E</HI> or <HI>S E,</HI> look how many hours you &s;ail, &s;o many miles the &s;tream wil &s;et you more forward in your longitude, then you are avvare of; and yet your lati|tude, vvil fal out according to your account. On the other &s;ide if you &s;ayl <HI>N W</HI> or <HI>S W</HI> in this current, the current vvil drive you backvvard &s;o many miles, and yet your latitude vvil be ac|cording to your account.</P>
<P>Thirdly, if the current run upon any rumbe betvveen the meridian, and the Ea&s;t or We&s;t, then your true motion vvil differ from your dead reckoning, and al&s;o from your account by ob&s;ervation, both in longitude and latitude, &s;o that until you knovv in &s;ome &s;ort both vvhich vvay and hovv fa&s;t the current runs, you can never keep a good account of your vvay and the onely way to finde out the current is to keep a good account by the log-line outvvard and homevvard, and by &s;et|ting this dovvn upon your blanck chart you may plainly &s;ee vvhich vvay the current runs, and hovv fa&s;t, as <HI>Ma&s;ter Nor|wood</HI> hath very vvel demon&s;trated in the end of his <HI>Sea-mans Practice.</HI></P>

For at every &s;hifting of your cour&s;e, the true point that you are in, cannot be &s;o certainly known, but that you may mi&s;reckon &s;omewhat both in the latitude and longitude thereof.

Then for the parallels, two of their points are their de|grees in the outward circle, and their third point is their cor|re&s;pondent degree in the diameter A B. By the&s;e three points you may finde the center, and &s;o draw the arch as is &s;hewed in the fir&s;t chapter. But to &s;ave that labour, you mu&s;t know, that the centers all lie in the diameter lines, which mu&s;t be exten|ded beyond the circle, and then the centers are thus found out. The diameter C D being divided into half tangents as before, if for every degree you account two, beginning from the cen|ter E, &s;o you &s;hal have the centers of the meridians. Then if you &s;et one foot of your compa&s;&s;es in that center, and open the other to the Pole A or B, it wil pa&s;&s;e through the corre|&s;pondent degree, or third point in the diameter C D: on the other &s;ide of the center, &s;o the meridian wil be drawn upon the one &s;ide. Then with the &s;ame di&s;tance of your compa&s;&s;es, you mu&s;t draw the other an&s;werable to that on the other &s;ide. Then keeping your compa&s;&s;es yet at the &s;ame di&s;tance, &s;et one foot in the center E, and with the other, marke the diameter A B, both above and below, and the&s;e markes &s;hal be the cen|ters of the parallels. Then &s;et one foot of your compa&s;&s;es in the&s;e centers, and clo&s;e your compa&s;&s;es, til the other foot reach to that degree of latitude in the outward circle and &s;o draw that arch from &s;ide to &s;ide And if you finde that the arches thus drawn, do pa&s;&s;e exactly through their three re&s;pective points, in the circle and diameter, your work is true, other|wi&s;e not.</P>
<P>For example, if you would draw the meridians and paral|lels of 45 degrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Example in the Meridians and Parallels of 45 degrees.</NOTE> fir&s;t the tangent of 45 being doubled, makes

Then to draw the parallels of 45 degrees, keep your compa&s;&s;es at this di&s;tance, and &s;etting one foot in the center E, with the other cro&s;&s;e the diameter A B, both above and below in the points G &amp; H, the&s;e are the centers for the parallels of 45, therefore &s;et one foot in the center G, and clo&s;e the other, till it reach to 45 degrees in the outmo&s;t circle, and &s;o draw the arch 45 R 45. Then &s;et one foot of your compa&s;&s;es in the other H, &amp; &s;o draw the other parallel 45 P 45. thus the&s;e 4 arches are drawn.</P>
<P>And thus you may ea&s;ily doe for any other degree under 45, but when you come to the degrees above 45, then you mu&s;t extend the line C D, and laying one end of your ruler to the point A, and the other to the degrees of the upper &s;emi|circle, you may divide that part of the line without the circle as you did before that part which was within, into half tangents, and &s;o doubling your degree find out the center therof. Or el&s;e when you draw the former meridians, you may remember to turne about the compa&s;&s;es, and marke the line C D without the circle; by the&s;e markes you &s;hal divide the line into half tan|gents, and &s;o you may finde out the centers as before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How to help your &s;elf when your compa&s;&s;es wil not reach.</NOTE>But becau&s;e &s;ome of the&s;e centers, wil fall &s;o farre without the circle, that your compa&s;&s;es will not reach them; you may then bridle a thin ruler, that wil bend, with a double &s;tring like a cro&s;&s;e bow, and then by tvvi&s;ting the &s;tring together, you may by little and little, &s;et it to what bent you plea&s;e, till it &s;hal cut the three points of your arch you would draw, and then vvith your pen, you may dravv your arch, vvhich if the ruler be all of one thickne&s;&s;e, and &s;o bend in all places alike, it vvil be very true.

The larger you make your draught, and the more meridians and parallels you draw in it, &s;o much the better it is, therefore if you can, make it &s;o large that you may draw meridians and

Then count upon the Meridian line from A, the difference of latitude of this place you are in (according to your ob&s;erva|tion) from the place you came la&s;t, and note where this num|ber ends, and marke wel the line that is drawn from this place, and trace it to your Index, and this point where this line cro&s;|&s;eth the Index, is the point where you are.

<P>Fir&s;t, lay your Index upon the line A P, which is the fir&s;t Rumbe from the Meridian, and keep it there, then count the difference of the latitude, which is 98 parts, in the meridian

And if you marke the line that runs through this point to the line of longitude, you &s;hal there &s;ee the difference of longitude which is 19 parts and a half to the Ea&s;tward from A, thus the propo&s;ition is fully re&s;olved.</P>
<P>But in this propo&s;ition you mu&s;t take notice, that if you &s;ail upon &s;everal Rumbes before you ob&s;erve the latitude, then fir&s;t you mu&s;t finde out the Rumbe which lies from your fir&s;t place, to the place where you are according to your dead reckoning (as is &s;hewed in the &s;ixt propo&s;ition of the Plane Chart) and then laying your Index upon this Rumbe, worke as afore&s;aid.</P>

But if your di&s;tance or difference of latitude be four or five degrres, you may then very wel work the propo&s;ition up|on your chart, without u&s;ing the Quadrat, and need not fear errour, if you be any thing careful, and work by a true &s;cale of rumbes and equal parts.</P>

<P>This table agrees with the former in mo&s;t things, the chief difference is in the longitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note the diffe|rence of this Table from the former.</NOTE> which mu&s;t be thus found out. By the Ea&s;ting or We&s;ting of your cour&s;e, you mu&s;t finde out the difference of longitude thereof according to the middle latitude, and &s;et it in the table under the la&s;t column, but one, noted thus (*) and this difference added or &s;ub&s;tracted as it ought to be in the la&s;t columne, &s;hews the true longitude of the place where you are. This wil be your be&s;t way to keep your dead reckoning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How to per|form the &s;e|cond propo&s;iti|on in all lati|tudes.</NOTE>Now for the &s;econd propo&s;ition, which is by the Rumbe, and the difference of latitude; to finde the difference of lon|gitude, and the di&s;tance. To perform this, fir&s;t knowing the latitudes of the two places, draw a line in your Qua|drant of latitude, by the middle latitude of the two places. Then count the difference of latitude in the &s;cale of the quadrant of latitude, A B, and where the num|ber ends, draw or ob&s;erve the line drawn from it, where it cro&s;&s;eth the line of the middle latitude, then taking this di|&s;tance in your compa&s;&s;es, mea&s;ure it in the &s;cale A B (increa&s;ed if need be) then work with this number upon the quadrat as is &s;hewed before <HI>page</HI> 89, as if this number were the true diffe|rence of latitude between the two places, &s;o you &s;hal finde out the true difference of longitude in degrees and parts. And for the true di&s;tance, if you ob&s;erve the parts of the Index of the quadrat at the&s;e points, and then mea&s;ure them in the line of the middle latitude, the line that runs from this point to the &s;cale of the quadrant, wil &s;hew the true di&s;tance.</P>
<P>For example, let the place from which you &s;ail be H, in the latitude of 45 degrees, let the Rumbe you &s;ail upon be <HI>N by E</HI> and let the difference of latitude be 98 parts; and it is requi|red to finde the true difference of longitude, and the di|&s;tance of this point.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t in the quadrant of latitude, draw the line A Z, by the middle latitude of the two places; which is 45 degrees, 49 parts, then in the &s;cale of the quadrant A B (counting the whole &s;cale or Radius for one degree) reckoning the difference of latitude 98, and ob&s;erve the parallel line that comes from
<PB N="95" REF="52"> this where it cro&s;&s;eth the line of the middle latitude which is at Z. Then &s;etting one foot of your compa&s;&s;es in this point Z, open the other to the center A, and mea&s;ure this di&s;tance in the &s;cale A B lengthened, and you &s;hal find it to be 140 parts: thus the true difference of latitude 98 parts is inlarged to 140 parts, which is the proportion it ought to have in this latitude. Then working with this difference of latitude inlarged upon the quadrat, as was &s;hew'd <HI>pag.</HI> 89. &amp; 90, fir&s;t, for 100 parts, I find the difference of longitude to be 20 parts, and the di&s;tance upon the Index is 102 parts, then likewi&s;e for the 40 parts; I finde the difference of longitude to be 8 parts, and the di|&s;tance on the Index is almo&s;t 41 parts. The&s;e two &s;ummes ad|ded together makes the true difference of longitude to be 28 parts, and the di&s;tance 143 parts almo&s;t. Now, la&s;tly, this di|&s;tance mea&s;ured in the line of the middle latitude, in the qua|drant of latitude, wil reach from A to D, and the line that runs from this place up to the &s;cale A B &s;hews the true di|&s;tance &s;ailed, which is one degree or 100 parts.</P>
<P>Thus having found out by ob&s;ervation at any time the true latitude of the place where you are, if it &s;hal differ from your latitude by dead reckoning, you may finde exactly in what point you are in re&s;pect of the longitude as wel as the latitude. And though &s;ome of the&s;e things may &s;eem at the fir&s;t a little difficult; yet if you con&s;ider wel, all that hath bin &s;aid before and &s;o under&s;tand the fir&s;t principles of the Worke, you &s;hal finde, that a little practi&s;ing of the&s;e que&s;tions, and &s;ome &s;uch like, which you may propo&s;e to your &s;elfe, wil make all very plain and ea&s;ie.</P>
