<HEAD>A Terrible and Bloudy Sea-fight between the Engli&s;h and the Dutch, upon the Coa&s;t of Cornwal: with the particulars there|of; and the number of &s;hips &s;unk, burnt and taken on both &s;ides; the like di&s;pute hath not been heard of the&s;e many yeares.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ON the fourteenth in&s;tant, the Dutch Arma|do (con&s;i&s;ting of four&s;core and ten &s;ayl, and twelve Fire-&s;hips) mounted on their Warlike Throne, &s;et forth Precepts to our &s;ons of Thunder, and cha&s;ed Captain Bane into this Harbour, who brings adverti&s;ements to the Ma|jor and Governour, that the whole Fleet are &s;tand|ing
<PB N="4" REF="3">up towards the I&s;le of Wight; from whence we hear, that they bare up on the back-&s;ide, and &s;ailed directly to Sir George Ay&s;cue, who were riding thirty miles off from Plymouth: And on the &s;ix|teenth in&s;tant, De-Witte their Admiral, with the re&s;t of his Men of War, even like a Grove of Ce|dars, bore up with hoi&s;ted and booming &s;ailes to|wards the South-Ea&s;t Sound, re&s;olving to act the Theatre of War upon that part of Neptune's Regi|on; in order thereunto, the Vice-Admiral of Zea|land, with twenty &s;tout &s;hips, and eleven Frigats, drew forth, and prepared them&s;elves for an A&s;&s;ault; which Sir George Ay&s;cue perceiving, gave imme|diate Orders and In&s;tructions to all his Captains, to ply windward, and to receive their &s;alutation, which was acted with &s;uch a revengeful rage, that both parties being inflamed, re&s;olv'd to fight untill the one was tamed; in&s;omuch, that Sir George with the Rainbow, charged them quite through, but not be|ing able to go to the windward of all, received 40 broad &s;ides, and with great difficulty got off, onely with the lo&s;s of three men, and his Bolt-&s;plit. In the mid&s;t of this di&s;pute, the re&s;t of our &s;hips were not &s;ilent; but each man acted with an irre&s;i&s;table cou|rage and re&s;olution; And from four of the clock, till 8 at night, the fight was extream hot; Then Nights
<PB N="5" REF="3">&s;able Curtains being drawn the di&s;pute cea&s;ed, and both fleets lay in a defen&s;ive po&s;ture again&s;t each o|ther, with all their lights hanging forth. This Con|flict was maintained with great gallantry and re&s;o|lution on both &s;ides; and great was the execution; for we have received great lo&s;s, the George and Bo|naventure, being much &s;hatter'd and torn, and for the pre&s;ent unfit for &s;ervice; divers were rent limb from limb by the Canon-&s;hot; &s;ome had their arms &s;hot off; others, their legs; among&s;t the re&s;t, valiant Captain Pack, (an excellent &s;tout Sea-man) hath his leg &s;hot off; Captain Li&s;le is wounded in the &s;houl|der, and &s;ince dead; Capt. Clerk is &s;aid to be &s;lain, &amp; divers others. Sir George lo&s;t 12 men, be&s;ides &s;ome wounded; and received 60 &s;hot in her Hull; the Samp&s;on, Elizabeth, and divers others, received great lo&s;s, and many a &s;tout Sea-man hath made the Sea his grave; and too too many (for the pre&s;ent) lies langui&s;hing of their wounds.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, the Hollander hath little cau&s;e to brag, for his lo&s;s is exceeding great, many of their &s;hips are rent and torn; the Rear Admiral is &s;unk, the Captain of Flu&s;hing, the Armes of Hol|land (beware the Body next) and three other gallant &s;hips.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>However, the Dutch-men re&s;olved not to decline engagement; but lay in a defen|&s;ive po&s;ture till Tue&s;day morning; at which time, they hung forth their bloudy flag of defiance, on the Top-ma&s;t head; and gave &s;undry Vollies from aboard, retaining them as Trophies of Victory; the which, did &s;o exa&s;perate the &s;pirits of the Engli&s;h, that a Councel of War was called, to con&s;ult what to do, in further proceedings again&s;t the enemy, and it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved by the &s;aid Councel to ingage them again: Hereupon preparation was made, and after prayers, and &s;eeking of God, for a ble&s;&s;ing upon their enterpri&s;e, the Admiral, with 33 Men of War, hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and &s;tood up to|wards them; and about one of the clock in the Afternoon, both Navies engaged, and for the &s;pace of &s;even houres furiou&s;ly was the fight maintained, and great execution a|gain
<PB N="7" REF="4">done on both &s;ides, e&s;pecially to the Hollanders; but the night drawing on, the di&s;pute ended: And this morning the ene|my had given us the &s;lip about &s;ix leagues; &s;ome of our &s;hips are in pur&s;uit; others are, come into this Harbour, with wounded men.</P>
<P>The five hundred men &s;ent from this Town to Sir George, deported them&s;elves with &s;ingular dexterity and courage, and were in the thicke&s;t of the Conflict; many of them are &s;lain, and about 60 wounded.</P>
<P>This hath been the bloudie&s;t Conflict that ever hapned between the two Repub|liques; and con&s;equently, 'tis but a begining of the Chaos of confu&s;ion; for it is now too late to di&s;pute the Ground-work, the Ar|guments of bloud being drawn at large in undeniable Maximes: Yet I doubt not, but the Lord will perfect that Work which he
<PB N="8" REF="5">hath thus triumphantly carried on, even for tho&s;e who de&s;ire to prai&s;e and magnifie his glorious Name. As for the particulars of the fight, I cannot repre&s;ent no otherwi&s;e, at pre&s;ent, but that we have taken &s;eventeen, &s;unk five, fired two, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t; but not without great lo&s;s, as is before &s;pe|cified; which is all at pre&s;ent, from</P>
