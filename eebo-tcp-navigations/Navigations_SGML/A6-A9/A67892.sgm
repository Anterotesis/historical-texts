<L>There was a louely boy the Nymphs had kept,</L>
<L>That on the Idane mountaines oft had slept,</L>
<L>Begot and borne by powers that dwelt aboue,</L>
<L>By learned <HI>Mercury</HI> of the Queene of loue:</L>
<L>A face he had that shew'd his parents fame,</L>
<L>And from them both conioynd, he drew his name:</L>
<L>So wondrous fayre he was&punc; that (as they say)</L>
<L><HI>Diana</HI> being hunting on a day,</L>
<L>Shee saw the boy vpon a greene banke lay him,</L>
<L>And there the virgin-huntresse meant to slay him,</L>
<L>Because no Nymphes did now pursue the chase:</L>
<L>For all were strooke blind with the wantons face.</L>
<L><PB REF="6">But when that beauteous face <HI>Diana</HI> saw,</L>
<L>Her armes were nummed, &amp; shee could not draw;</L>
<L>Yet did she striue to shoot, but all in vaine,</L>
<L>Shee bent her bow, and loos'd it streight againe.</L>
<L>Then she began to chide her wanton eye,</L>
<L>And fayne would shoot, but durst not see him die.</L>
<L>She turnd and shot, and did of purpose misse him,</L>
<L>Shee turnd againe, and did of purpose kisse him.</L>
<L>Then the boy ran: for (some say) had he stayd,</L>
<L><HI>Diana</HI> had no longer bene a mayd.</L>
<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> so doted on this rosiat face,</L>
<L>That he hath oft stole closely from his place,</L>
<L>When he did lie by fayre <HI>Leucothoes</HI> side,</L>
<L>To dally with him in the vales of Ide:</L>
<L>And euer since this louely boy did die,</L>
<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> each day about the world doth flie,</L>
<L>And on the earth he seekes him all the day,</L>
<L>And euery night he seekes him in the sea:</L>
<L>His cheeke was sanguine, and his lip as red</L>
<L>As are the blushing leaues of the Rose spred:</L>
<L>And I haue heard&punc; that till this boy was borne,</L>
<L>Roses grew white vpon the virgin thorne,</L>
<L>Till one day walking to a pleasant spring,</L>
<L>To heare how cunningly the birds could sing,</L>
<L>Laying him downe vpon a flowry bed,</L>
<L>The Roses blush'd and turnd themselues to red.</L>
<L>The Rose that blush'd not, for his great offence,</L>
<L>The gods did punish, and for impudence</L>
<L>They gaue this doome that was agreed by all;</L>
<L>The smell of the white Rose should be but small.</L>
<L><PB REF="6" MS="y">His haire was bushie, but it was not long,</L>
<L>The Nymphs had done his tresses mighty wrong:</L>

<L>His eyes were <HI>Cupids:</HI> for vntill his birth,</L>
<L><HI>Cupid</HI> had eyes, and liu'd vpon the earth,</L>
<L>Till on a day, when the great Queene of loue</L>
<L>Was by her white doues drawn fro~ heauen aboue,</L>
<L>Vnto the top of the Idalian hill,</L>
<L>To see how well the Nymphs their charge fulfill,</L>

<L>In nursing of her sweet <HI>Hermaphrodite:</HI></L>
<L>VVhom when she saw, although complete &amp; full,</L>

<L>And therefore, more the wanton boy to grace,</L>
<L>She puld the sparkling eyes from <HI>Cupids</HI> face,</L>
<L>Fayning a cause to take away his sight,</L>
<L>Because the Ape would sometimes shoot for spight.</L>
<L>But <HI>Venus</HI> set those eyes in such a place,</L>

<L>For his white hand each goddesse did him woo:</L>
<L>For it was whiter then the driuen snow:</L>
<L>His legge was straighter then the thigh of <HI>Ioue</HI>:</L>
<L>And he farre fairer then the god of loue.</L>
<L>When first this wel-shapt boy, beauties chiefe king,</L>
<L>Had seene the labour of the fifteenth spring,</L>
<L>How curiously it paynted all the earth,</L>
<L>He 'gan to trauaile from his place of birth,</L>
<L>Leauing the stately hils where he was nurst,</L>
<L>And where the Nymphs had brought him vp at first:</L>
<L><PB REF="7">He lou'd to trauaile to the coasts vnknowne,</L>
<L>To see the regions farre beyond his owne,</L>
<L>Seeking cleare watry springs to bathe him in:</L>
<L>(For he did loue to wash his iuory skinne)</L>
<L>The louely Nymphes haue oft times seene him swimme,</L>
<L>And closely stole his clothes from off the brim,</L>
<L>Because the wanton wenches would so fayne</L>
<L>See him come nak'd to aske his clothes againe.</L>
<L>He lou'd besides to see the Lycian grounds,</L>
<L>And know the wealthy Carians vtmost bounds&punc;</L>
<L>Vsing to trauaile thus, one day he found</L>
<L>A cristall brooke, that tril'd along the ground,</L>
<L>A brooke, that in reflection did surpasse</L>
<L>The cleare reflection of the clearest glasse.</L>
<L>About the side there grew no foggy reedes,</L>
<L>Nor was the fount compast with barren weedes:</L>
<L>But liuing turfe grew all along the side,</L>
<L>And grasse that euer flourisht in his pride.</L>
<L>Within this brook a beauteous Nymph did dwell,</L>
<L>Who for her comely feature did excell;</L>
<L>So faire she vvas, of such a pleasing grace,</L>
<L>So straight a body, and so sweet a face,</L>
<L>So soft a belly, such a lustie thigh,</L>
<L>So large a forehead, such a cristall eye,</L>
<L>So soft and moyst a hand, so smooth a brest,</L>
<L>So faire a cheeke, so well in all the rest,</L>
<L>That <HI>Iupiter</HI> would reuell in her bowre,</L>
<L>Were he to spend againe his golden showre:</L>

<L>Her lip was softer then the softest silke,</L>
<L><PB REF="7" MS="y">Her haire as farre surpast the burn sht gold,</L>
<L>As siluer doth excell the basest mold:</L>
<L><HI>Ioue</HI> courted her for her translucent eye,</L>
<L>And told her, he would place her in the skye,</L>
<L>Promising her, if she would be his loue,</L>
<L>He would ingraue her in the heauen aboue,</L>
<L>Telling this louely Nymph, that if he would,</L>
<L>He could deceiue her in a showre of gold,</L>

<L>And so deceiue her of her maiden-head:</L>
<L>But yet, because he thought that pleasure best,</L>
<L>Where each consenting ioynes each louing brest,</L>
<L>He would put off that all-commaunding crowne,</L>
<L>Whose terrour strooke th'aspiring Giants downe,</L>

<L>To taste the amorous pleasures of her bed:</L>
<L>This added he besides, the more to grace her,</L>
<L>Like a bright starre he would in heauens vault place her.</L>
<L>By this the proud lasciuious Nymph was mou'd,</L>

<L>Shee was contented that almighty <HI>Ioue</HI></L>

<L>She shut her eyes &amp; blind-fold thus did woo him:</L>
<L>Fayre boy, thinke not thy beauty can dispence</L>
<L>With any payne due to a bad offence;</L>
<L>Remember how the gods punisht that boy</L>
<L>That scorn'd to let a beauteous Nymph enioy</L>
<L>Her long wisht pleasure; for the peeuish elfe,</L>
<L>Lou'd of all others, needs would loue himselfe.</L>
<L>So mayst thou loue, perhaps thou mayst be blest,</L>
<L>By graunting to a lucklesse Nymphs request:</L>
<L>Then rest awhile with me amid these weeds.</L>
<L>The Sunne that sees all, sees not louers deeds;</L>
<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> is blind when loue-sports are begun,</L>
<L>And neuer sees vntill their sports be done:</L>
<L>Beleeue me, boy, thy blood is very stayd,</L>
<L>That art so loth to kisse a youthfull mayd.</L>
<L><PB REF="17" MS="y">Wert thou a mayd, and I a man, Ile show thee,</L>
<L>With what a manly boldnesse I could woo thee:</L>
<L>Fayrer then loues Queene, thus I would begin,</L>
<L>Might not my ouer-boldnesse be a sinne,</L>
<L>I would intreat this fauour, if I could,</L>
<L>Thy rosiat cheeke a little to behold:</L>
<L>Then would I beg a touch, and then a kisse,</L>
<L>And then a lower; yet a higher blisse:</L>
<L>Then would I aske what <HI>Ioue</HI> and <HI>Laeda</HI> did,</L>
<L>When like a Swan the craftie god was hid?</L>
<L>What came he for? why did he there abide?</L>
<L>Surely I thinke hee did not come to chide:</L>
<L>He came to see her face, to talke, and chat,</L>
<L>To touch, to kisse: came he for nought but that?</L>
<L>Yes, something else: what was it he would haue?</L>
<L>That which all men of maydens ought to craue.</L>
<L>This sayd, her eye-lids wide she did display:</L>
<L>But in this space the boy was runne away:</L>
<L>The wanton speeches of the louely lasse</L>
<L>Forc't him for shame to hide him in the grasse.</L>
<L>When she perceiu'd she could not see him neere her,</L>
<L>When she had cal'd, and yet he could not heare her,</L>
<L>Looke how when <HI>Autumne</HI> comes, a little space</L>
<L>Paleth the red blush of the Summers face,</L>
<L>Tearing the leaues the Summers couering,</L>
<L>Three months in weauing by the curious spring,</L>
<L>Making the grasse his greene locks go to wracke,</L>
<L>Tearing each ornament from off his backe;</L>
<L>So did she spoyle the garments she did weare,</L>
<L>Tearing whole ounces of her golden hayre:</L>
<L><PB REF="18">She thus deluded of her longed blisse,</L>
<L>With much adoo at last she vttred this:</L>
<L>Why wert thou bashfull, boy? Thou hast no part</L>
<L>Shewes thee to be of such a female heart.</L>
<L>His eye is gray, so is the mornings eye,</L>
<L>That blusheth alwayes when the day is nye.</L>
<L>Then his gray eye's the cause: that cannot be:</L>
<L>The gray-ey'd morne is farre more bold then he:</L>
<L>For with a gentle dew from heauens bright towre,</L>
<L>It gets the mayden-head of eu'ry flowre.</L>
<L>I would to God, he were the rosiat morne,</L>
<L>And I a flowre from out the earth new borne!</L>
<L>His face was smooth; <HI>Narcissus</HI> face was so,</L>
<L>And he was carelesse of a sad Nymphs woe.</L>
<L>Then that's the cause; and yet that cannot be:</L>
<L>Youthfull <HI>Narcissus</HI> was more bold then he,</L>
<L>Because he dide for loue, though of his shade:</L>
<L>This boy nor loues himselfe, nor yet a mayd.</L>
<L>Besides, his glorious eye is wondrous bright:</L>
<L>So is the fierie and all-seeing light</L>
<L>Of <HI>Phoebus,</HI> who at eu'ry mornings birth</L>
<L>Blusheth for shame vpon the sullen earth.</L>
<L>Then that's the cause; and yet that cannot be:</L>
<L>The fierie Sunne is farre more bold then he;</L>
<L>He nightly kisseth <HI>Thaetis</HI> in the sea:</L>
<L>All know the story of <HI>Leucothoe.</HI></L>
<L>His cheeke is red; so is the fragrant Rose,</L>
<L>Whose ruddie cheeke with ouer-blushing gloes:</L>
<L>Then that's the cause; and yet that cannot bee:</L>
<L>Eche blushing Rose is farre more bold then he,</L>
<L><PB REF="18" MS="y">Whose boldnesse may be plainely seene in this,</L>
<L>The ruddy Rose is not asham'd to kisse;</L>
<L>For alwayes when the day is new begun,</L>
<L>The spreading Rose will kisse the morning Sun.</L>
<L>This sayd, hid in the grasse she did espie him,</L>
<L>And stumbling with her will, she fel down by him,</L>
<L>And with her wanton talke, because he woo'd not,</L>
<L>Beg'd that, which he poore nouice vnderstood not:</L>
<L>And, for she could not get a greater blisse,</L>
<L>She did intreat at least a sisters kisse;</L>
<L>But still the more she did the boy beseech,</L>
<L>The more he powted at her wanton speech.</L>
<L>At last the Nymph began to touch his skin,</L>
<L>Whiter then mountaine snow hath euer bin,</L>
<L>And did in purenesse that cleare spring surpasse,</L>
<L>Wherein <HI>Actaeon</HI> saw th'Arcadian lasse.</L>
<L>Thus did she dally long, till at the last,</L>
<L>In her moyst palme she lockt his white hand fast:</L>
<L>Then in her hand his wrest she 'gan to close,</L>
<L>When through his pulses strait the warme bloud gloes,</L>
<L>Whose youthfull musike fanning <HI>Cupids</HI> fire,</L>
<L>In her warme brest kindled a fresh desire.</L>
<L>Then did she lift her hand vnto his brest,</L>
<L>A part as white and youthfull as the rest,</L>
<L>Where, as his flowry breath still comes and goes,</L>
<L>She felt his gentle heart pant through his clothes.</L>
<L>At last she tooke her hand from off that part,</L>
<L>And sayd, It panted like anothers heart.</L>
<L>Why should it be more feeble, and lesse bold?</L>
<L>Why should the bloud about it be more cold?</L>
<L><PB REF="19">Nay sure, that yeelds, onely thy tongue denyes,</L>
<L>And the true fancy of thy heart belyes.</L>
<L>Then did she lift her hand vnto his chin,</L>
<L>And prays'd the prety dimpling of his skin:</L>
<L>But straight his chin she 'gan to ouerslip,</L>
<L>When she beheld the rednesse of his lip;</L>
<L>And sayd, thy lips are soft, presse them to mine,</L>
<L>And thou shalt see they are as soft as thine.</L>
<L>Then would she faine haue gone vnto his eye,</L>
<L>But still his ruddy lip standing so nie,</L>
<L>Drew her hand backe, therefore his eye she mist,</L>
<L>'Ginning to claspe his neck, and would haue kist;</L>
<L>But then the boy did struggle to be gone,</L>
<L>Vowing to leaue her and that place alone.</L>
<L>But then bright <HI>Salmacis</HI> began to feare,</L>
<L>And sayd, Fayre stranger, I wil leaue thee here</L>
<L>Amid these pleasant places all alone.</L>
<L>So turning back, she fayned to be gone;</L>
<L>But from his sight she had no power to passe,</L>
<L>Therefore she turn'd, and hid her in the grasse,</L>
<L>When to the ground bending her snow-white knee,</L>
<L>The glad earth gaue new coates to euery tree.</L>
<L>He then supposing he was all alone,</L>
<L>(Like a young boy that is espy'd of none)</L>
<L>Runnes here, and there, then on the bankes doth looke,</L>
<L>Then on the cristall current of the brooke,</L>
<L>Then with his foote he toucht the siluer streames,</L>
<L>Whose drowzy waues made musike in their dreames,</L>
<L>And, for he was not wholy in, did weepe,</L>
<L>Talking alowd and babbling in their sleepe:</L>
<L><PB REF="19" MS="y">Whose pleasant coolenesse when the boy did feele,</L>
<L>He thrust his foote downe lower to the heele:</L>
<L>O'recome with whose sweet noyse, he did begin</L>
<L>To strip his soft clothes from his tender skin,</L>
<L>When strait the scorching Sun wept teares of brine,</L>
<L>Because he durst not touch him with his shine,</L>

<L>When beauteous <HI>Salmacis</HI> awhile had gaz'd</L>
<L>Vpon his naked corps, she stood amaz'd,</L>

<L>Scarce can she now deferre her hoped ioy;</L>
<L>So fast her youthfull bloud playes in her vaynes,</L>

<L>When young <HI>Hermaphroditus</HI> as he stands,</L>
<L>Clapping his white side with his hollow hands,</L>
<L>Leapt liuely from the land, whereon he stood,</L>

<L>Like Iu'ry then his snowy body was,</L>

<L><PB REF="20">Then rose the water-Nymph from where she lay,</L>

<L>Why shouldst thou so desire to be alone?</L>
<L>Thy cheeke is neuer fayre, when none is by:</L>
<L>For what is red and white, but to the eye?</L>
<L>And for that cause the heauens are darke at night,</L>

<L>All creatures that beneath bright <HI>Cinthia</HI> be,</L>
