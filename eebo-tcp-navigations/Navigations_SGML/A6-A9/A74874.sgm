Nay quoth Mr. <HI>Marriot,</HI> I have not done it, but the Knaves that held me in the Street, but I hope I &s;hall recover the time I have lo&s;t to all your Contents, and &s;o fell on a dozen of Pigeons, and a leaze of &s;uck|ing Rabbets; which having devoured (to the wonder of the behol|ders) quoth he, Gentlemen, I doe not like this pidling di&s;hes, have you no &s;ub&s;tantiall Beefe or Mutton left in the hou&s;e, and &s;o what was remaining, was brought in, which he as ea&s;ily de&s;troyed as the other, and was ready for more: But <HI>Marriot</HI> being over-heated with coming, and falling fir&s;t on the cold Cream, and drinking &s;udden|ly after it, found &s;uch quarrelling in his Guts, that he was unable to &s;it longer at Table, and before he could get from thence, &s;hewed &s;ome te&s;timony of his loo&s;e Condition, to the prejudice of all their No&s;es there pre&s;ent. His Vocative ca&s;e made the Gentlemen weary of his Company; and finding him wor&s;e and wor&s;e, they cau&s;ed a Porter to be called for, and bargained with him to lead him to his Lodging; but before the Porter got halfe way, he was &s;o &s;trong of Mon&s;ieur Sir Reverence, that he was not to be endured. The Por|ter e&s;pying a fellow with a Wheelbarrow, called him, and told him the Gentleman was &s;ick, and if he would carry him home, he would be very well paid for his paines, for hee was a Per&s;on of Quality. The fellow with hopes of profit, was armed again&s;t Senior <HI>le Faugh,</HI> and takes him in, and carries his Wor&s;hip, but &s;ee his fate! he was unhappily carried that way where the Gentlemen had made &s;port with him in the Morning, &s;o that the Shop-keepers and Boys, e&s;py|ing him in that ca&s;e, ran out and cryed, The great Eater has over|eaten him&s;elf; to whom <HI>Marriot</HI> &s;til cryed, good Chri&s;tians forbear, and do not mocke a dying man, ha quoth the Boyes, This is the great Eater of <HI>Grays Inne:</HI> A pox upon you quoth the Wheelbarrow fellow, art thou the Cormorant?

The Doctor was &s;ent for, who, when he &s;aw the Worme, told him that it was a Worme that had long time bred in his body, and would have come to a more perfect growth, had not that acci|dent of eating the cold Creame (which is an Enemie to tho&s;e kinde of Wormes) and drinking &s;uddenly after it, curdled it, and &s;o &s;uffo|cated and killed the Worme; for which re&s;olvement, Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> gave him not only thanks, but payed him for his Purge, and to this day keeps the Worme (dryed up) in his Chamber, which was then about three yards long. But it is conceived by the Wi&s;e, that it left behind at that time, young ones, which are grown to a greater big|ne&s;&s;e, as may appeare by the growth of his Stomack, but whether it be or not, Time and &s;uch another Surfeit will produce, and untill which time you mu&s;t have patience.</P>

<P>IT happened that two Citizens of <HI>London</HI> had a falling out, whether it were for their own hone&s;ty or their Wives, I know not, which I &s;hall not here que&s;tion; but by &s;ome Neighbours they were advi&s;ed to put it to Arbitration, each man was to choo&s;e two &s;ufficient men in the Pari&s;h, to end this Controver&s;ie, rather then to go to Law to &s;pend much Money on both &s;ides, and neither the Gainer; all partyes are agreed to put it to Arbitration, which accordingly was done; and he who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have done the wrong, was by the&s;e learned men, judged to give the party wrong|ed, a Supper for him&s;elfe and his Friend; the time and place was appointed, and all are Friends again.</P>
<P>Yet he who had received the wrong, and not well plea&s;ed with the Re&s;ult of the Arbitration, &s;till retained an inward Grudge, though he &s;eemingly carryed a faire out-&s;ide to the other, and did &s;tudy how to vex him: at la&s;t he thought, that if he could get Mr. <HI>Marriot</HI> with him, hee &s;hould be &s;ufficiently revenged on him: for he knew that his Stomack was able to undo two &s;uch hou&s;e|keepers as he was, might he have but a full Table continually, he
