<P>He was for Countrey and Quality a <HI>Grecian</HI> of Regal Extraction; and having as he con|ceived been more hardly dealt with by Women than his innocence de&s;erved, and experimenting the dangers that re&s;ult from Conver&s;e with that Sex, yea even from the mo&s;t vertuous of them, though not alwayes through their fault; He, in charity to <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>unheedy Youth,</HI> who are mo&s;t obnoxious to their Malignity, de&s;ired his friend <HI>Philiternus</HI> to commit his Life to Writing, and commend it to their Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Which Injunction <HI>Philiternus</HI> faithfully di&s;|charged by Penning this Relation in the <HI>Greek</HI>
<PB REF="8">Tongue, from whence the <HI>Gravity</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Spani|ard</HI> conde&s;cended to teach it that &s;tately Language, wherewith Mr. <HI>Herberai,</HI> an excellent Per&s;onage was &s;o well plea&s;ed that he converted it into <HI>French,</HI> which Tran&s;lation being approved of by <HI>Bartol.

<HEAD>ARNALDO; OR THE Injur'd Lover.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P>_THe day had already began to dawn upon the Mountains tops, when getting out of the poor Lodging wherein I had pa&s;t the precedent night with rea&s;onable tranquillity, I began my journey; and the Sun had not in|crea&s;ed &s;o far as to make a full di&s;clo&s;ure of his face to mortals, when finding my &s;elf at the en|trance of a very &s;pacious Forre&s;t, into which my Hor&s;e thru&s;t him&s;elf, and through ab&s;tru&s;e and di&s;con&s;olate tracks, penetrated into its mo&s;t &s;ecret retirements, I &s;et my &s;elf in the heat of that illu&s;trious Planet's Meridian-rayes, un|der the leavey-&s;hade of a lofty Platan, to repo&s;e me near the plea&s;ant murmure of a little rive|let,
<PB N="2" REF="10">which, dilated into &s;undry windings, &s;ought to empty it &s;elf into a River, with which the Forre&s;t was in a manner wholly inviron'd. It was not long that I had there &s;ate, before the plea&s;ant whi&s;perings of the Aire and Brook had reconciled my eyes to &s;leep, and that I made my head to lean on the Root of that Platan; and &s;carce had I given up my brows to a languid &s;lumber, when &s;leep repre&s;ented to me the ap|pearance of a young Lady. I fancied, that with a behaviour &s;ufficiently obleiging, &s;he en|quired of me my name, quality, and the occa|&s;ion of my journey: But I not having (oppre&s;|&s;ed by an unu&s;ual lethargy) knowledge, or power to find words to &s;atisfie her demand; the Apparition, offended at my fatal taciturnity, &s;mote me on the brea&s;t with a Serpent: Thus, &s;aith &s;he &s;hall I be &s;ure to know who thou art; and &s;uddenly di&s;appear'd. I by this time awaking with a lowd cry, found my heart perplex'd by a cruel pa&s;&s;ion, and my face no le&s;&s;e covered with tears than with &s;weat. Having there|fore depo&s;ed the muddine&s;&s;e of my face in the clearne&s;&s;e of the water, and forded the delight|full rivolet, I felt my pa&s;&s;ions augmented to that heighth, that they oppre&s;s'd my &s;pirit, and equally &s;et at liberty the reins of my Hor&s;e, and tho&s;e of my Rea&s;on; nor took I any other food then what my griefs admini&s;tred, to who&s;e mer|cy fortune had abandoned me. Thence, ju&s;t at the time that Sol, leaving the lowne&s;&s;e of the Valleys, retreated his rayes to the tops of the Hills, I came into a place that had an A&s;cent; from which there repre&s;ented it &s;elf to my eye
<PB N="3" REF="10">the pro&s;pect of a great Plain, in form of an ar|tificial Theater, which, incircled on every &s;ide by the Forre&s;t, dignified its Center with a &s;tately Pallace, berounded with a well proportioned fronte of little Cypre&s;&s;es, which expected the favour of time, to increa&s;e with their umbrage the melancholine&s;&s;e of that Seat; which, covered with black Marble, made a fair but mournfull di&s;clo&s;ure of its Grandure. I therefore fix'd my eye full of admiration upon that &s;trange Edi|fice; and whil'&s;t the curio&s;ity to know the in|habitants of &s;o lugubrious a place, led me out of my former track; I &s;aw i&s;&s;ue out of the oppo|&s;ite part of the wood, a Troup of men, which in the &s;adne&s;&s;e of their habits, and langour of their deportment, declared them&s;elves very much grieved. There went before this compa|ny a Knight, who by his own appearance, and by the Garb of his followers might be pre&s;umed Lord of the re&s;t, as, with his &s;ighs, and the abun|dance of his tears he made him&s;elf believ'd more then all others afflicted. He breathed from his pale and meager face a mo&s;t lamentable pen&s;ive|ne&s;&s;e, which tormented the hearts of the behol|ders, &s;o much the more forcibly, by how much the more un&s;uteable &s;o mournfull a look ap|peared to &s;o courteous an aire. In the mean time the melancholy Knight, drawing near to the place where I, for the unexpectedne&s;&s;e of the incounter, had made a halt, and rai&s;ing his eyes to &s;teal a look; he di&s;cover'd me: although at the fir&s;t acco&s;t he appear'd &s;omewhat mov'd, yet with a gracefull &s;mile he clear'd up the tem|pe&s;t of his face, con&s;training me with a &s;weet
<PB N="4" REF="11">violence, to take, in his Heremetical habitation, a &s;hort repo&s;e. Thereupon, taking me by the hand, he conducted me with a very &s;low pace towards the gates of his hou&s;e; over which I, who being a &s;tranger made curious ob&s;ervations of the things of the place, &s;aw a gilded &s;croul, in which with black Characters was ingraven the&s;e words:
<Q><L>O man! that chance, or curio&s;ity,</L>
<L>Hath drawn this mo&s;t unhappy lodge to view,</L>
<L>Know 'tis own'd by &s;uch who onely death per&s;ue,</L>
<L>And, (dying every moment,) cannot dye.</L></Q></P>
<P>Having with mine eyes run over, and with my mind lightly con&s;idered the&s;e Ver&s;es, we en|tred into that di&s;con&s;olate Man&s;ion, wherein all things repre&s;ented objects of heavine&s;&s;e and grief; &s;ince the Hall and Chambers, hung onely with black furniture, wrought in the heart a &s;ad melancholy, which almo&s;t bereaving a man of him&s;elf, in de&s;pight of all he could do did con&s;train him to &s;hed tears. Over the Nieces of the doors of each room, there hung after the u&s;e of <HI>Italy</HI> &s;everal goodly pictures, but in as much as the repre&s;entation that they made of Tragi|cal Loves, did in a great mea&s;ure impair their delightfulne&s;&s;e; the eye might not be fix'd on them, without the prejudice of the mind, of|fended by the &s;trange &s;ight of tho&s;e mi&s;erable occurrences. Being left for a little &s;pace by the courteous Knight, to repo&s;e my body in a Cham|ber le&s;&s;e-&s;adly furni&s;hed, he returned him&s;elf in per&s;on to invite me to Supper, which by rea&s;on
<PB N="5" REF="11">of the hot &s;ea&s;on I found was prepared with real Magnificence in a very &s;pacious Hall; where no &s;ooner arriv'd, but carually ca&s;ting my eyes on the Walls I there ob&s;erved, covered by a thin Vail, a Magnificent picture, in which I di&s;|covered depainted a young Lady, who&s;e face &s;eem'd to be de&s;cended to inform the Graces with all the proportions requi&s;ite to render it a breathing picture of beauty. Her complexion did onely mourn with dolorous appearance: a Vermillion &s;tream of bloud, which trickling from her brea&s;t, transfixed by a little Dagger, ran to &s;tain with mournfull drops her Attire. I was ju&s;t about to vent by my mouth in words the curio&s;ity of my mind to know what this picture did &s;ignifie, when it entred &s;uddenly in|to my thoughts, that perhaps from her took birth the deplorable cau&s;e, which held that hou&s;e buried in &s;o profound a &s;ilence. Yet by that mode&s;t re&s;pect which ought to regulate the a|ctions of men well-de&s;cended, in another man's hou&s;e, I refrained for that time to &s;atisfie my curio&s;ity, and &s;ate down at Table with the Knight, where, be&s;ides the &s;ingularity and abun|dance of the cheer, I admired the marvelous or|der of the &s;ervice, proper to a great Prince.</P>
<P>Supper being ended, and finding the time con|venient, I introduced a mode&s;t di&s;cour&s;e tend|ing to the &s;atisfaction of my de&s;ires; with which I &s;o mov'd the Knight, that he gave me no an|&s;wer but in the&s;e few words. Pacify you fir&s;t the Gho&s;t of <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> with acquainting me Who you be, and the occa&s;ion of your journey; and then I will likewi&s;e to morrow (it being now
<PB N="6" REF="12">time that you retire to your repo&s;e) &s;atisfie your curio&s;ity. I obeyed him, but not without occa&s;ioning in him &s;trange a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;o unwonted adventures. And the Knight a&s;&s;ert|ing a fatal nece&s;&s;ity in his reque&s;t, entertained me a &s;hort &s;pace in &s;uperfluous Complements of excu&s;e, but not with &s;uperfluous Te&s;timo|nies of his incomparable genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>Performing therefore the injunction of the Knight, he withdrew with a di&s;compo&s;ed coun|tenance into his Lodging, and I al&s;o was, with treatments of &s;ingular courte&s;ie, attended and &s;erved, in the apartment prepared for me. There at la&s;t being left alone, I went to bed, a&s;&s;aulted by various thoughts, occa&s;ioned in me partly by the things I had heard, and partly by tho&s;e which I did expect to hear the next day: and that which did not a little foment my inquietude, was, the reverberated memory of my ab&s;ence from that per&s;on, which being more dear to me then my own life, I &s;hall &s;ooner want a Soul in my brea&s;t, then &s;uffer my love to dimini&s;h in the lea&s;t. Yet in the end wearied with long watching, I lightly accommodated my eyes to repo&s;e: but &s;carce had &s;leep di&s;tended his plea&s;ant wings over my &s;en|&s;es, when, fir&s;t by a &s;oft murmure gently &s;truck and warbled, and after by a lamentable Mu&s;ick, I was &s;o awakened, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me in all that di&s;mal night to receive the &s;weet|ne&s;&s;es of <HI>Lethe.</HI> Thereupon I gave my &s;elf to hearken if I could know what &s;o lugubrious a &s;ong might intend, in &s;o late an hour; and knew in the end that the Knight my Ho&s;t was the un|happy occa&s;ion of that lachtimous ditty; af|flicting
<PB N="7" REF="12">him&s;elf in renewing the rewfull me|mory of his misfortunes, accompanied in this &s;ad office by his &s;ervants, who, too tender in the affects of their Ma&s;ter, did increa&s;e with their vain plaints that grief, which they ought rather with mature prudence to have tempered. So long was the mournfull harmony of tho&s;e no|cturnal &s;acrifices, that I at la&s;t more moved by wearine&s;&s;es than pity, de&s;ired nothing el&s;e but only that the Sun, di&s;&s;ipator of vain phanta&s;ms, which in the night obnubilate the phancies of mortals, would ri&s;e and illuminate the hemi|&s;phear; and already it (become compa&s;&s;ionate of my wailing) almo&s;t began to dart the Horizon with his rayes: When the Knight entering in &s;ud|denly and dome&s;tically into my Room, invited me to be a &s;pectator of the Divine Ceremonies, which in a little Temple adjoyning to his Pal|lace he did celebrate. Being come thither, I re|&s;ted no le&s;&s;e &s;tupified with the richne&s;&s;e of that edifice, which in the conci&s;ene&s;&s;e of its Gyre emulated the &s;umptuo&s;ity of the mo&s;t renown'd Temples of the World; than with the &s;ingulari|ty of its Architecture, which &s;eemed to have di&s;-embowelled it &s;elf to render it a miracle of Art. This admirable Chappel was, in the exteri|our circuit, of a &s;pherical figure, berounded with Columnes of black Marble, upon Pede&s;tals of bra&s;&s;e, and with Chapters, and Arches of the &s;ame matter marvelou&s;ly wrought. In the &s;paces be|tween the Columnes, and over the Arches, which &s;upported a front of double Corni&s;hes, there was placed, in proportionate di&s;tances, &s;undry Sta|tues, Hi&s;torical and Fabulou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ome of Porphyr,
<PB N="8" REF="13">others of Allabla&s;ter and Bra&s;&s;e: but the &s;ummity of the roof, wrought with Marquetry into little foliages of Marble, inclo&s;ed a great Statue which by its aged face, by its wings disjointed from the &s;houlders, and by a dyal put in his right hand, repre&s;ented an Image of the Temple. On the We&s;t-&s;ide, was &s;ituate the Magnificent and lofty Gate by which men enter to Wor&s;hip; in who&s;e pro&s;pect towards the Ea&s;t, did glitter an emi|nent Altar of pure&s;t Marble, incha&s;ed with mo&s;t precious Jemms; and &s;uch, and &s;o much was the &s;plendor, which from the Carbuncles, Chry|&s;olytes, and Cry&s;tals did beam forth, that with|out the help of windows, which might impart the rayes of the Sun, it &s;ufficiently illuminated that religious dwelling of the Divinity. On the o|ther parts South and North, hung in equal pro|portion two exceeding large pictures, le&s;&s;e rich indeed in Jewels than the Altar; but frauded perhaps with greater cunning, &s;ince it &s;eemed (to who intentively beheld them) that the Painter and the Carver had &s;trove in formalities to give the World a marvelous exce&s;&s;e of Art; &s;o excel|lently were di&s;covered the draughts of the pen|cil, in giving life to the tele; and &s;o rarely were impre&s;t the touches of the chizel in inlivning the Marbles, that they &s;erved as an Ornament to the tele. The Walls were covered with ex|ceeding black &amp; &s;plendid jet, and the pavements did even &s;hine with the black Marbles which were laid upon them. In this noble Chappel was erected, more than two foot above the floor, a Sepulcher of polite Alabla&s;ter finely hi&s;torified with divers impre&s;&s;es of Love, bordered and gar|ded

<P>Now, whil'&s;t the Prie&s;ts went about with Sa|cred Rites, and pious Oblations to appea&s;e the anger of the offended Divinity; I &s;ometimes &s;uf|fered the curio&s;ity of my eyes to wander after the guidance of fancy about the things, which there within did offer them&s;elves to the mind to be con&s;idered: and with &s;o much the more inquie|tude, by how much, through the &s;mall know|ledge I drew from thence, the de&s;ire of behold|ing them came to foment. The Divine functi|ons ended, the Knight, after having augurated to me that day to be happy, took me by the hand and led me out of the Temple, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the people which did follow him, and carried me all alone through a narrow path into the Forre&s;t; ju&s;t where a little Mountain dividing it &s;elf into three equal parts, did form with natural plea|&s;ures the pro&s;pect of a delightfull Theater. There did i&s;&s;ue from its foot a tran&s;parent rivolet; but &s;o &s;cant at that time of water, that it did reveal to the negligence of the eye, all the &s;ecrets of its bottom. There were &s;een through tho&s;e fre&s;h &s;treams little fi&s;hes to &s;port them&s;elves among the candid pebles. But about the moi&s;tned banks
<PB N="10" REF="14">did grow as in well ordered knots, a hundred va|rieties of odoriferous Herbs, embroidered with a thou&s;and &s;orts of flowers, which opening as it were their brea&s;ts to the ruddy morning, did emit the aire of &s;o delicate a perfume, that it had power to efface in great part from my heart the annoyance, which through the pa&s;t waking, and through the dolefulne&s;&s;e of the things which I &s;aw, was there &s;o deeply rooted. The back|&s;ide of the Tripartite hill over&s;pread with Oaks and Pines, by nature di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;po&s;ed with a negligent art, did over&s;hadow &s;ome very green Meadows, which in the middle of the Forre&s;t, haply through the benefit of the neighbouring Brook, renouncing to the commerce of the plants, did con&s;erve in their plea&s;ant largene&s;&s;e the roots of the flowers inviolate. In one of the&s;e the Knight &s;at down, and I placing my &s;elf over again&s;t him, after many &s;ighs in a langui&s;h|ing and &s;ad tone, he gave beginning to his Narra|tion after this manner. From the fir&s;t Original, which it may be you will not believe, I mu&s;t de|rive to you, mo&s;t dear gue&s;t, the dolorous relation of my uncomfortable di&s;adventures: and though the mind abhorreth the remembrance of pa&s;t griefs; yet becau&s;e notwith&s;tanding cu&s;tom hath converted grief into nature, I &s;hall fully make relation of as much as I &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary, that you may be able another day to manife&s;t to the World the cruelty of a woman, and the dy&s;|a&s;ters of a Lover abu&s;ed. I was born <HI>(Philiternus)</HI> in the famous Citie of <HI>Thebes,</HI> Queen of <HI>Boetia,</HI> of a &s;tock both generous, and nearly-allied to the Royal family, with replicated bonds of con|&s;anguinity;
<PB N="11" REF="14">and from my birth had given me the name of <HI>Arnaldo</HI> (for thus my father was called him&s;elf: a Knight no le&s;&s;e renowned in the Coun&s;els of State then in the matters of War). Being grown to boy's e&s;tate, the pui&s;&s;ant King <HI>Agenor</HI> my Uncle would have me dwell in his Court, to be brought up in the noble Company of his &s;ons, whence I learnt in a little &s;pace the qualities convenient to a Knight of great birth; nor did I indure much labour to attain to the highe&s;t Dignities of the Court and King|dom; nor was I envied (if it be lawfull for me to &s;ay it) by any; having preobliged the affe|ctions of all hearts, with the affability of my manners, with the complacency of my con|ditions, and the profu&s;ene&s;&s;e of my riches: I obtained in gift from Heaven a Wit, greater then my Fortune. Now it befell for my fatal di&s;|ea&s;e that I being with the Court in <HI>Thebes,</HI> there pa&s;s'd from this life to a better <HI>O&s;iander,</HI> a princi|pal Knight and well de&s;erving from the Crown; who&s;e ob&s;equies the King him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to honour with his pre&s;ence, with all the flower of the Nobility of his Kingdom. Oh that do|lorous Dagger wounded me to the very heart, with the mournfull remembrance of that mo&s;t unfortunate day! Among the other friends of the defunct Cavalier, which a&s;&s;i&s;ted at his Funeral, there was a young Lady his daughter, which be|&s;ides her being very beautifull of face, and com|placential of deportment, with &s;o pitifull a deje|ctedne&s;&s;e did bewail the death of her father, that each circum&s;tance in the Ocean of tho&s;e tears made &s;hipwrack of a heart. She had di&s;ordered
<PB N="12" REF="15">with her tender hands her &s;ilver tre&s;&s;es, whence one part of them de&s;cending on her &s;houlders, in precious Rings did incatenate the mind of the Spectators in &s;tupor of her extream beauty: the other but ill retained by her hair-laces ran to bathe them&s;elves in the dolefull floud of &s;or|row, which overran the face, ambitious perad|venture to inrich with Pearls the nudity of their Gold. Thence her amiable face appeared a Sun which aro&s;e from the Sea with locks moi&s;tened with cele&s;tial Dew, and even had u&s;urped the property of the ri&s;ing Sun, whil'&s;t that fair face obfu&s;cated by the Clouds of perplexity &s;uffered it &s;elf to be &s;een without offence of the behol|ders, whereas in the noon-tide of cheerfulne&s;s there was no eye &s;o firm as to be able to &s;u&s;tain without peril of blindne&s;s the reflexion of its &s;plendors. As &s;oon as on this prodigious Creature I fix'd my looks, I pre&s;ently felt a fatal &s;hivering to &s;ei&s;e my Soul, which calling my bloud to the &s;uccour of my heart, left my face overca&s;t with a mortal palene&s;s. And well might it be that he &s;eemed dead, from whom one onely look of <HI>Lu|cinda</HI> had ravi&s;hed his Soul: Fair <HI>Lucinda</HI> was &s;he called, who was the happy cau&s;e of all my de|plorable unhappine&s;s. I de&s;ired really to fly from that perilous &s;ight; my mind being de&s;irous to avoid the mortal danger which I fore&s;aw; but Pity, a cha&s;te companion that never &s;eparates from Love, recalled me to compa&s;&s;ionate the grief of the weeping Dam&s;el, by little and little introducing into my mind, and impre&s;&s;ing in my heart tho&s;e langui&s;hing beauties of which they finally became an Idolater, though they be
<PB N="13" REF="15">now reduced to a&s;hes; the &s;parks of my love live notwith&s;tanding, and &s;hall live perpetually buried in tho&s;e Cinders.</P>
<P>That magnificent Funeral being ended, and having waited upon the King back to his lodging, I incontinent returned to that Temple, in which I had left my Soul depo&s;ited under the credit of <HI>Lucinda</HI>'s beauty; and Love was for my misfor|tune &s;o courteous, that I had an opportunity of incountring her, whil'&s;t among the &s;ad troup of her Allies &s;he returned to the for&s;aken hou&s;e of her father; into which being entred &s;he carried with her, and included between tho&s;e ble&s;sed Walls, my perplexed &s;pirit: whereupon remain|ing almo&s;t an exanimate Carka&s;s, I withdrew my &s;elf with a &s;low pace to my hou&s;e, without knowing where I was, or whither I went: but onely that the privation of my &s;pirit, tran&s;mi|grated into the object beloved, made me with re|iterated &s;tingings to know, that yet I remained without a Soul in the World of the living. Be|ing come there, I withdrew, with the violent companion of my new thoughts, from the con|ver&s;ation of my familiars; conceiting (unexpe|rienced that I was) to find in &s;olitude a com|fort for my pain: but it did the more foment it; and I perceived in the end, that retiredne&s;&s;e from the commerce of people, wrought no other in me than a perplexing multitude of torments. Sleep &amp; Appetite to food forthwith left me; and &s;eeing my &s;elf lo&s;t in a Love upon my own ad|vice, without hope, I began wholly to abandon the care of my health: So that in a few dayes I &s;eemed wholly altered from my &s;elf in the eyes
<PB N="14" REF="16">of the world. I &s;ometimes attempted to &s;uppre&s;&s;e that fervent amorous pa&s;&s;ion, which did afflict me; but the more I forced my &s;elf to conceal it, the more invigorating it &s;elf, did it blaze out with greater impetuo&s;ity: whence, my malady continually increa&s;ing I &s;aw my &s;elf in a little &s;pace reduced mi&s;erably to peri&s;h in the arms of melancholy and de&s;peration. But Nece&s;&s;ity, the di&s;creet inventer of healthfull contrivances, would have me live for my hurt, &s;ugge&s;ting to me that I ought not utterly de&s;pair of my health: &s;ince that, though the &s;ight of and &s;peech to <HI>Lucinda</HI> was not by fortune permitted me; I might notwith&s;tanding ea&s;ily be able to pene|trate her meaning, finding among my Pages a youth which by being formerly a &s;ervant to her father, had acce&s;&s;e to the hou&s;e with much liber|ty, and without &s;u&s;pition. Whereupon I made known to him more with tears, which unawares betrayed my con&s;tancy, then with words, the in|ternal grief of my heart, and I de&s;ired him he would follow his wonted vi&s;its more frequent|ly; and report to me what he could di&s;cover of the per&s;on and wit of <HI>Lucinda.</HI> The Page obeyed me with &s;ufficient di&s;cretion and mode&s;ty; and ob&s;erving for &s;ome time what &s;eemed to him op|portune to my intere&s;ts, he thru&s;t me on finally with his per&s;wa&s;ions, to write a Letter to my fair Enemy in this manner.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I had rather mo&s;t lovely <HI>Lucinda</HI> that you <Q>&s;hould draw the truth of tho&s;e griefs which in|viron my Soul from the &s;ight of me; than, in the dead Letters of this Paper, you &s;hould di&s;cover their appearances: But although the black lines
<PB N="15" REF="16">of the ink cannot &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;e the abun|dance of the tears, which the bitterne&s;&s;e of my dy&s;a&s;ters di&s;til from my heart; I &s;hall at lea&s;t at|tempt thereby to manife&s;t to you in &s;ome part the cruel pa&s;&s;ions of my Soul, which, hereto|fore transfu&s;ed into your beautifull brea&s;t, &s;tands expecting from your goodne&s;&s;e &s;ome gale of grace, which may &s;uffice to keep it alive. Be therefore plea&s;ed to know Madam, that from that day, which you celebrated in the Temple the exequies of your mo&s;t worthy father, I re|mained in &s;uch manner fettered by the inchant|ments of your Divine beauty, that when you re|turned to your hou&s;e to con&s;umate with flouds of tears the paternal funerals, I retired to my Chamber to commence with the deluge of my plaints the celebration of the grief of my heart, which I had left inclo&s;ed in the radiant Sepul|cher of your fair eyes. I will not deny Madam, but that I have &s;triven to force my &s;elf to ca&s;t off the yoak of &s;ervitude, which the Soveraign Ma|je&s;ty of your looks hath impo&s;ed by vertue of Love upon the liberty of my &s;pirit: but in &s;um the in&s;uperable power of your beauty binding my Rea&s;on with Adamantine cords would have me follow chained, the Chariot of its triumphs. I &s;et my &s;elf therefore to love you, becau&s;e de|&s;tiny hath commanded it; and will love you eternally becau&s;e my Inclination impo&s;eth it. I reque&s;t no other of you Madam, but onely that you would plea&s;e to accept the &s;acrifice of my affections, which all contracted in one &s;igh of Love I offer to the Idol of your &s;uper-humane beauty; and that you would not at lea&s;t deny
<PB N="16" REF="17">me the happine&s;s of your pre&s;ence, that I may in the con&s;olation of your cele&s;tial remembrance &s;weeten the bitterne&s;s of my &s;ufferings, and that you may di&s;cover in my mortified looks the lively pledges of my fidelity.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Having written this Letter &amp; con&s;igned it to <HI>Diffilus</HI> the Page, and in&s;tructed him in the man|ner with which he &s;hould tran&s;act the me&s;sage to <HI>Lucinda,</HI> I retired into the &s;olitude of my Clo&s;et, &s;trongly a&s;saulted by fear and hope to expect the i&s;sue. <HI>Diffilus</HI> went, and by good for|tune ob&s;erved that <HI>Lucinda</HI> accompanied by a Girle her &s;lave, was bu&s;ied about her feminine imployments; he &s;uddenly acco&s;ted her, giving her my Letter, intreating her to receive it. But &s;he pre&s;ently clouded her face, to which the mind imparted the &s;udden motions of its di&s;|plea&s;ure; and beholding him with a fierce look commanded him pre&s;ently to get him&s;elf out of her &s;ight, and never dare to do the like to her, as he tendered his life. But the cunning Groom that knew the anger of a beautifull woman to be ju&s;t like the &s;top of a Noble Cour&s;er, not a jot affrighted by tho&s;e angry appearances, multi|plied his intreaties with no le&s;&s;e affection than di&s;cretion: whereupon <HI>Lucinda</HI> &s;eeing her &s;elf importuned with &s;o much prudence, and being unwilling to yield to &s;o affectionate an a&s;&s;ault, aro&s;e to retire into &s;ome more private room, where it was not permitted <HI>Diffilus</HI> to follow her. Whence he perceiving of her intention, ju&s;t as &s;he was ri&s;ing up to depart, ca&s;t the Let|ter
<PB N="17" REF="17">into her bo&s;om with &s;o civil a behaviour, that &s;he was nece&s;&s;itated to take it. An unhappy ne|ce&s;&s;ity for me; &s;ince as if it had been a Viper &s;he pre&s;ently tore it, reducing it to &s;moak and a&s;hes.</P>
<P>This unhappy accident, related to me by the Page, gave me ea&s;ily to under&s;tand what I might expect from this my unfortunate Love. My tor|ments therefore did in &s;uch manner increa&s;e, that I e&s;teemed nothing but death able to deliver me. Thence I became &s;o much an Enemy to my &s;elf, that my pain, become familiar to me, left me to fall irrecoverably into a Gulf of de&s;perate thoughts; among which mi&s;erably con&s;uming my dayes, there came to me one morning <HI>Diffilus,</HI> a curious ob&s;erver of the actions of <HI>Lucinda,</HI> to tell me &s;he would be the following night in an adja|cent Temple, to celebrate the rites of a grand &s;o|lemnity: It ran in my mind that I might perad|venture be able (hid among&s;t the nocturnal um|brages, and covered with womans apparel) to weave a plea&s;ant &s;nare for my proud enemy; from which if I &s;hould get no other, I &s;hould at lea&s;t with di&s;cour&s;e in &s;ome part vent my grief, and perhaps that Love would &s;econd with greater &s;ucce&s;&s;e the lively force of my words, than he had done the dead Characters of my Letter. This propo&s;ition being re&s;olved on, and the night de|&s;ired being come, I dre&s;t my &s;elf in a &s;ute of <HI>Be|li&s;a</HI> my &s;i&s;ter, and with the onely attendance of <HI>Diffilus,</HI> who in like manner habited did conduct me into the Temple; and ju&s;t in the place where he knew <HI>Lucinda</HI> would &s;it, he placed me. And though the tenderne&s;&s;e of my age, which then &s;carce pa&s;&s;ing the eighteenth year, had not yet
<PB N="18" REF="18">covered my face with the fir&s;t down; and the un|certain twilight, which in the nocturnal dark|re&s;&s;e the burning Tapers formed, did exceedingly favour our de&s;ign: I kept neverthele&s;&s;e with pre|text of the coldne&s;&s;e of the winter-&s;ea&s;on my face covered with a Vail, to avoid the curio&s;ity of the eyes of them, who frequent the Temple for no other end, than with their looks to lay &s;iege to Ladies. Scarce was I &s;etled in that place, when <HI>Lucinda</HI> appeared accompanied with &s;o numerous a train of &s;ervants, that I e|&s;teemed it a thing almo&s;t hopele&s;&s;e to get any occa&s;ion to &s;peak to her. Now while &s;he was approaching to my &s;eat, me-thought that my heart skipping within me, would have leapt out of my brea&s;t; and they that at that time had ob|&s;erved my face would have judged me mortally wounded; it was at that in&s;tant over&s;pread with &s;o &s;trange a palene&s;&s;e. Yet in the end <HI>Lucinda</HI> was come clo&s;e to me, and by the &s;ingularity of my dre&s;&s;e and deportment, believing me to be a Lady of great quality; courteou&s;ly &s;aluting me, &s;he &s;ate down clo&s;e by me: But what I an&s;wered to her civil Salute, I cannot remember; my &s;pi|rits being at that time lo&s;t in con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ence of her, who was the &s;ole cau&s;e of all my enthu&s;ia&s;ms, &s;o that they were di&s;abled to all external functions. Yet recollecting by little and little my bani&s;hed forces, more by the benefit of the nights ob&s;curity than by any violence I knew how to offer on my &s;elf; being a&s;&s;i&s;ted al&s;o by the &s;ollitude in which <HI>Lucinda</HI> re|mained (the croud of her &s;ervants being with|drawn into &s;everal parts of the Temple) I be|gan
<PB N="19" REF="18">plainly in this manner to expre&s;&s;e my mind.</P>
<P>Dear <HI>Lucinda,</HI> if Fortune &s;hall but grant me as much ability to expre&s;&s;e my torments, as you have power to make me feel them; I &s;hould re|pute my &s;elf no le&s;&s;e fortunate then you be fair. It will therefore concern your affability not to regard the confu&s;ion of my &s;peeches, but to con|&s;ider the afflictions of my heart, that compels me to pronounce them. I know not, courteous Madam, what profit you can expect from my ruin; nor what good you can extract from my evil. The tearing of my Letter was truely an impetuous motion of an offended mind: but the continual rending of my heart can be impu|ted to no le&s;&s;e then an exce&s;s of cruelty. If this agree to a beautifull Lady, I leave you your &s;elf to judge. And what excu&s;e can you find that may &s;tand you in&s;tead to defend the &s;everity of your treatment towards him, who loves you above his own life, or rather that as to his Ter|rene Godde&s;s, con&s;ecrateth upon the Altar of his fidelity, his heart in a perpetual <HI>Holocau&s;t?</HI> You might ea&s;ily, Madam, openly di&s;cover in my langui&s;hing looks what be the torments occa&s;io|ned no le&s;s by your beauty then by your rigour: and yet the &s;uffering them grieves me not a jot, I am onely di&s;plea&s;ed that you are not plea&s;ed to accept my &s;ufference; Sweeten, I implore you, with the drop of &s;ome favour the bitterne&s;s of &s;uch &s;everity: for that Lady &s;pots not the can|dor of her hone&s;ty, which with a &s;ingle &s;yllable of courte&s;ie favours the affects of a noble Cava|lier her Adorer. Other favour, Madam, I re|que&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="19">not of you than verbal. It &s;ufficeth me you be &s;till &s;erved by honouring me with the Title of your Slave, and &s;ome declaration that my &s;ervices are not indifferent to you; ble&s;|&s;ing me now and then with a compa&s;&s;ionate look. It's but a poor word, it's but a tran&s;ient glance to one, whom it may recal from death to life.</P>
<P>Thus proceeded I with a langui&s;hing voice, intermingling my prayers with my tears: But <HI>Lucinda</HI> (I believe that indignation would not permit her before, to reply) when &s;he perceived me thus run on, with a trembling and di&s;compo|&s;ed voice (a &s;ign of great agitation of &s;pirit) thus interrupted me.</P>
<P><HI>Arnaldo,</HI> I an&s;wer at this time to your propo|&s;itions to the end you deceive not your &s;elf in the judgement you may pa&s;&s;e upon my intenti|ons, and le&s;t perhaps pre&s;uming upon my &s;i|lence, you may not nouri&s;h &s;ome fallacious hope to your prejudice and my own di&s;honour. I &s;hall know of a truth that you love me, if with de&s;i&s;ting from your unadvi&s;ed enterprize you will cea&s;e to trouble me. It is not for me to teach you what means you &s;hould u&s;e to cure this amorous infirmity: but if you be but as di&s;|creet in your de&s;ires, as with your &s;ighs you pretend to make me believe you are pa&s;sionate; you would be able of your &s;elf to inve&s;tigate the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I u&s;e not to you that tigour which I ought, be|cau&s;e I reverence your birth; but provoke me not in coming in this form, for you &s;hall draw with &s;ecurity little &s;atisfaction from your bold|ne&s;&s;e.
<PB N="21" REF="19">Con&s;ider therefore, and remember that deceivers are wont to fall into the Nets of the deceits they intended for others.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer of <HI>Lucinda</HI> was like Oyl, which, powred upon my burning heart, made the flame of my dolours to &s;oment the more, &s;ince the more her words dimini&s;hed my hope, the more they increa&s;ed my de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her. Thence by con&s;idering the Divine beauty of her countenance, and by hearkning to the grace of her cele&s;tial di&s;cour&s;e, ravi&s;ht out of my &s;elf, I re|tained not in me any part of life, but onely Me|mory, which attentively waited if it might be able to draw any thing of benefit from that con|gre&s;&s;ion. But &s;he neverthele&s;&s;e having done &s;peaking, and making as if &s;he would be gone, if immediatly I did not obey her, I retired mo&s;t di&s;|con&s;olate out of the Temple, and being returned to my hou&s;e, I &s;hut my &s;elf into my Clo&s;et, and there rea&s;oned to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable <HI>Arnaldo!</HI> What hope can be able &s;till to flatter thy di&s;con&s;olate heart to mi&s;lead thy tormented &s;pirit? Perceive&s;t thou not, O wretch, that thy unbridled de&s;ire having led thee too high, menaceth thee with &s;ome mi&s;erable precipice?

Alas! Alas, too vain are my thoughts, and too ra&s;h my purpo&s;es. It's impo&s;sible that I can ever heal this amorous infirmity, if beauty it

My di&s;con&s;olate &s;pirit! wherefore &s;taye&s;t thou any longer in this thy mi&s;erable abode, now that it is become a ruth|le&s;&s;e Hell of uncomfortable afflictions? Unfor|tunate <HI>Arnaldo!</HI> When thou beginne&s;t to want &s;trength, thou begin&s;t to augment thy torments; and in&s;tead of &s;eeking a Salve to thy evils by the con&s;tancy of a generous Cavalier, thou lo&s;e&s;t thy &s;elf in the weakne&s;&s;e of vulgar Lovers! And how long ha&s;t thou &s;erved <HI>Lucinda,</HI> that &s;he ought to give thee her Love? With the price then of a few moneths of &s;ervitude woulde&s;t thou go about to purcha&s;e the reward of her fa|vour? The gifts of Love are not obtained with &s;o little labour.

<P>Thus, agitated betwixt divers purpo&s;es, and lacerated by various skirmi&s;hes of different af|fects, I knew not to which part, either of hope, or of de&s;peration, to betake my &s;elf: but like a &s;hip in the main Ocean to&s;t by the winds, and a&s;|&s;aul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the Waves, I lived incloi&s;tered in the &s;olitude of my Lodgings, without ever going out of the &s;torm of my &s;adne&s;&s;e, grief, and &s;orrow: I

<P>FOr as much as the <HI>King</HI> &s;aw me not to ap|pear any more in Court, and under&s;tanding in part my new affliction; thinking perhaps to plea&s;e me, he elected me maintainer of a Ju&s;ting which he had proclaimed for the approaching fea&s;t of the Spring. And though I was at that time more di&s;po&s;ed to retiredne&s;&s;e then to the company of Gallants; yet becau&s;e I would not di&s;plea&s;e the King, I accepted of it. Thereupon, my Soul flattered with I know not what gale of alacrity, I not onely prepared my &s;elf to the de|&s;igned enterpri&s;e&punc; but communicated my re&s;o|lutions to a certain number of youthful Knights, and we agreed upon a mo&s;t capricious Mask to pre&s;ent at the fea&s;t which, the night following the Turnament &s;hould be celebrated in the Roy|al Hall. But for as much as the de&s;ire of glory did not ea&s;e my heart &s;o much of the weight of its afflictions, that they did not &s;till pre&s;&s;e me down to the center of melancholly; being got up with the Aurora of that fatal day; I would have
<PB N="24" REF="21">the &s;adne&s;&s;e of my habit accompany into the field the &s;orrow of my mind. So mounted on a <HI>Thracian</HI> Cour&s;er, I appeared in a military po|&s;ture, armed with black Arms, with a Ca&s;&s;ock of black Velvet imbroidered with &s;tuds of Pearl: an embleme of my tears. The creft of my Helm was dignified with no other en&s;ign, than a mournfull Plume of &s;able feathers. But in my &s;hield I had cau&s;ed to be depainted a Limbeck from which did drop-in divers parts of the di&s;til|led water with this Motto: <HI>And within burneth.</HI> Now whil&s;t the elected Knights prepared to the cour&s;e, I vaulted upon my Hor&s;e before the Scaffold of the Queen, and rai&s;ing my eyes by chance, I &s;aw my fair <HI>Lucinda,</HI> which upon an adjoyning Scaffold wrapt in her mournfull Man|tle (in tho&s;e Countreys they wear the mourning for their Parents a compleat year) darted through tho&s;e Clouds the luminous rayes of her Divine face, and menaced with death, who ever through too much boldne&s;&s;e &s;hould have attempted to fix their looks, on the immortal Sun of that glit|tering beauty. What befell me upon &s;o unexpe|cted and a&s;toni&s;hing a &s;ight, if ever you have been a Lover, you are able to judge. I think I &s;hould never have remembred the affair that had called me into that place (I was &s;o be&s;ides my &s;elf), if <HI>Lucinda</HI> taking notice of my &s;tupefaction, with a &s;udden fiction of talking with another Lady of her acquaintance, had not, in depriving me of the &s;erenity of her face, made me to for&s;ee the tem|pe&s;t, which began to ri&s;e in my heart, which, calmed in part by the con&s;ideration of my duty in &s;o great an occurrence, I in the end gave be|ginning
<PB N="25" REF="21">to the Tilting; of which as the incoun|ters and accidents were various, &s;o it would be nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould expatiate in a &s;uperfluous di&s;|cour&s;e if I &s;hould recount them all: It &s;hall &s;uf|fice to tell you, that my &s;ucce&s;&s;e in that adven|ture was &s;uch, as I was not able to de&s;ire more with my vows to Fortune for the increa&s;ement of my glory: if love of glory had been able at that time to open a way in that brea&s;t which knew no other affect then the love of <HI>Lucinda.</HI></P>
<P>The Turnament being concluded with the day, and accompanied with the applau&s;e of all people to my hou&s;e, I di&s;armed, and masked my &s;elf with the re&s;t of the Knights my compani|ons; and came into the Hall appointed for the Ball, where, in the pre&s;ence of the King, the dan|ces were begun. My con&s;orts each of them ha|ving took out his Lady to dance, I withdrew my &s;elf apart, more then ever troubled with my fears, and di&s;tracted by my griefs to &s;ee my &s;elf poor in that good of which I had &s;o much need, and rich in that evil which I did &s;o much abhor. Yet fi|nally, (thru&s;t forward by that de&s;ire, which, en|kindling in my Soul, did &s;et me all on fire) I drew near al&s;o with trembling feet to my fair <HI>Lucinda</HI> to invite her to dance, with almo&s;t a cer|tain credence of being refu&s;ed. And truely the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of that Lady confirm'd my belief: But yet in the end con&s;trained by genero&s;ity, and by the accu&s;tomed frequency of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, &s;he courteou&s;ly gave me her hand. But what pa&s;|&s;ions did not torment my wretched heart, &s;eeing my felicity &s;o nigh me, and the remedy of my in|felicity &s;o remote? The dance being ended,

<HEAD>Arnaldo <HI>to</HI> Lucinda.</HEAD>
<P>LUcinda, <HI>If I was granted as well the means to redre&s;&s;ing my misfortunes, as I have occa&s;ion of expre&s;&s;ing them; I am certain I &s;hould be more con|tented, than now I find my &s;elf agrieved: But &s;ee|ing you have bereft from my heart all feeling of con|&s;olation, though not from my mind all &s;en&s;e of good judgement; have patience al&s;o, I be&s;eech you, if I write to you that which doth not plea&s;e you. But what can I write, &s;ince I have written and &s;aid &s;o much already of my pa&s;&s;ions and mi&s;eries? Let it &s;uffice you to know, that except you be in the end moved with commi&s;eration of my pa&s;&s;ion and &s;uffer|ings, you &s;hall in a &s;hort time &s;ee the date of my life terminated in my death. And yet, alas, you might with more ea&s;e, if you &s;o plea&s;ed, collect the infinity of my &s;ufferings, from my words and from my tears, which abound in my eyes, the &s;peaking mirrours of inamoured and langui&s;hing minds. I am truely mi&s;e|rable, &s;ince the more con&s;tant my fidelity is, the more remi&s;&s;e you are in vouch&s;afing it a recompence. And whereas you think, that by giving peace to my life
<PB N="27" REF="22">you mu&s;t proclaim War again&s;t your virtue; I will not de&s;ire you to do any thing, nor will I &s;peak any thing that may offend you. It &s;hall content me, if you but onely vouch&s;afe &s;ometimes to ca&s;t your eye on my torments, &s;o that the &s;weetne&s;&s;e of your looks may al|lay the &s;harpne&s;&s;e of my &s;orrow: for by this &s;light fa|vour you may ea&s;ily obtain pardon for the many in|juries you have &s;o often done me. For this onely, be not I be&s;eech you &s;o mortal an Enemy; for if you de&s;ire I &s;hould dye, I al&s;o will not much de&s;ire to live; and &s;o we may with little labour both receive &s;atisfaction: where as on the other &s;ide denying me this, the memory of your cruelty and my death would be eternalliz'd. I verily believe, that if you would but follow for a little the impul&s;e of rea&s;on, you &s;hould &s;ee how that it's an act unworthy of a noble, and courteous Lady, to torment tho&s;e that offend you not; unle&s;&s;e you can call offence my con&s;tancy in loving you, and the re&s;olution I have taken of alwayes &s;er|ving you. But if you continue in the &s;ame opinion which you have formerly expre&s;t, remember a little, remember,</HI> Lucinda, <HI>the &s;ufferings that I undergo: I am confident that if my torments were but con&s;idered by you according to what they are; you would ra|ther repent them, then perpetuallize them with &s;o much &s;everity. And really it's a &s;trange thing and almo&s;t incredible, that you had rather be cruel to tho&s;e that love you, than be &s;erved by tho&s;e that adore you. For, did you but conde&s;cend to con&s;ider the &s;orrow you return me in recompence of the &s;er|vices I tender to you, I a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf, that you would plainly &s;ee how in glorious it is to in&s;ult in my ruin. I conclude this my pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;cour&s;e, words being &s;uperfluous after that my pre&s;ence hath pre|&s;ented
<PB N="28" REF="23">you with &s;o many demon&s;trations of my tor|ments.

</LETTER>
<P>THis Letter being written and &s;eal'd, I re|turned into the Hall, where coming in a certain throng near to <HI>Lucinda,</HI> I put it in the &s;lieve of her upper Garment; and withdrew to ob&s;erve how &s;he would entertain it. But for a long time that I had watcht her, I could ob&s;erve nothing: Whereupon I flattered my &s;elf with the hope of &s;ome pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e to my at|tempt. I was therefore &s;o di&s;tracted with this perplexity of thoughts, that I either an&s;wered nothing, or el&s;e be&s;ides the purpo&s;e to tho&s;e who entertained me with &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e of the pre|&s;ent Occurrences, either of the Ball, or Court. And he that in that in&s;tant had toucht my brea&s;t, might ea&s;ily have felt the palpitations of my heart cau&s;ed by de&s;ire, and perplexing fear, the daughters of a de&s;perate Love.</P>
<P>The time being come at la&s;t, that (the Ball be|ing ended) every one retired to their own hou&s;e, ob&s;erving that <HI>Lucinda</HI> would take leave of the Queen, I waited on her, di&s;gui&s;ed in an unknown Garb, not onely home to her hou&s;e, but into her Chamber, without being able to ob&s;erve any thing in her that contributed &s;o much as an
<PB N="29" REF="23">atome to my hope. Hence being little inclined to re&s;t for that night, I di&s;patcht <HI>Diffilus</HI> thither at the &s;ame time, to bring me back &s;ome news of the fortune of that Paper, which I had adven|tured in the &s;lieve of <HI>Lucinda:</HI> but he could hear nothing good or bad. Whereupon my natural vigour dimini&s;hing by this fixt application, and my grief encrea&s;ing, continually &s;calding my heart in the inextingui&s;hable flames of &s;ighs, I became wholly melancholy and &s;olitary, never de&s;iring to &s;ee the face of the Sun more, out of my Chamber.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> my &s;i&s;ter, moved to compa&s;|&s;ion of my mi&s;ery, as one who felt a great part of it her &s;elf; &s;itting down clo&s;e by me one day, &s;he weeping &s;aid. <Q>Ah! my dear brother, I, intreat thee to acquaint me with the fatal cau&s;e of this grief, which &s;o much afflicts thee. See&s;t thou not that thy affliction is my torment; and that the love I bear thee, makes me to live for thy &s;orrow a mo&s;t unhappy life? Thou ha&s;t many times confe&s;t thy &s;elf to be my debter, and that thou woulde&s;t recompence my love with a reciprocal affection; But you deny me that with your actions, which you confirm to me with your words. You know very well, that &s;uch like di&s;simulation ought not to have place near me: make therefore my brea&s;t the depo&s;itory of thy pa&s;sions. And to whom wilt thou commit them, if thou wilt not intru&s;t them to me? Do but think that if thou de&s;ire&s;t death, I will not wi&s;h for life; If thou hate&s;t plea&s;ure, I will love &s;orrow; If thou delighte&s;t in trouble, I will be di&s;plea&s;ed with repo&s;e: &s;o
<PB N="30" REF="24">that thy malady and my torment are one and the &s;ame thing to excruciate my heart. If there|fore you de&s;ire to ventilate your pa&s;sion, with whom better can you do it then with me, that am never &s;paring in wi&s;hing your good? I am &s;ure that di&s;charging one part of it upon me, we &s;hall together be the better able to bear it. For if thou ha&s;t a de&s;ire to weep, I will weep: if you will comfort your &s;elf in your grief, I will ex|pedite my con&s;olation: and if you de&s;ire to conceal and nouri&s;h it, we two can be better able then thou alone to hide and feed it. Shew not, I pray thee, &s;o little confidence in her which hath nothing in all the world that is not thine; and make it believed in the end, that thy di&s;simulation cannot fal&s;ify my judgement; while&s;t thy tears and thy &s;ighs, thy &s;adne&s;&s;e, and thy &s;olitude accu&s;e me, and too plainly di&s;cover, that which you &s;eek with &s;uch care to hide and conceal. It's certain, death ought to be le&s;&s;e powerfull then brotherly love; and that therefore death it &s;elf &s;hall be mo&s;t welcom to me, when by it thou &s;halt come to acquire a joyfull life, &s;ince that I &s;ee thee arrived to that pa&s;&s;e, that thou can&s;t not long continue alive. But I had rather you would a&s;&s;ume the &s;pirits of your genero&s;ity, and cheer up your &s;elf, con|&s;idering that fortune is alwayes an Enemy of the happy, and favourable to the afflicted: and therefore &s;he being by nature fickle and incon|&s;tant, whereas it befits the fortunate to fear, I would have thee accu&s;tom thy &s;elf to hope in her vici&s;situde. She ever cau&s;eth new actions for the tryal of our minds, becau&s;e her pui&s;&s;ance
<PB N="31" REF="24">is better known by the pro&s;perous, then by the calamitous. Re&s;erve not therefore thy anxious &s;olitude to thy &s;elf alone: for, if greater is the evil that's hid, than the evil that is manife&s;t, thy communicating of it to me may afford thee &s;ome &s;uccour. I intreat thee, dear brother, I intreat thee, let the Key of my coun&s;el open for thee the Door of thy comfort and health; the peril that's concealed being alwayes greater in every occurrence, then that which is di&s;co|vered. Speak to me therefore, if you love me, and love that we &s;hould live together, whether it be dolefully or cheerfully.</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> &s;ighing, held her peace: I reply'd. <Q>Thou ha&s;t &s;o afflicted me (dear &s;i&s;ter) with thy pa&s;&s;ion, that in &s;ome mea&s;ure to comfort thee, I mu&s;t be forced to tell thee what I am unwil|ling to di&s;clo&s;e. I pray you, before I reveal my condition to you any farther, not to trouble your &s;elf with any &s;uperfluous care, becau&s;e I &s;hall &s;ee an end of my dayes, before you &s;hall &s;ee a beginning of the remedy to my dy&s;a&s;ters. Know therefore (&s;i&s;ter) that, more by impul&s;e of &s;trange Fortune, then by any act of my own will, I was compelled to &s;toop to the Laws of Love, by which Fortune hath de&s;ired to make me acquire &s;o much with the merit of my &s;er|vice, that to my torment I have felt the ingra|titude of her I &s;erved. My misfortunes have already taken &s;o deep impre&s;&s;ion in my heart, that Fortune in vain forceth her &s;elf with her &s;low revolutions to bring any Medicine of com|fort: &s;o that if death in the end do not &s;uccour me, relief will come too late from other parts.
<PB N="32" REF="25">I will not then de&s;pair of life, even in a conti|nual death; and therefore I pray thee, dear &s;i&s;ter, rather to comfort then afflict thy &s;elf, that thou ha&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> a brother, which knows how, and is able to undergo (conquering him&s;elf) &s;o many troubles. For if yet you de&s;ire I &s;hould be comforted, and you would do me a good office; let me never &s;ee thy face &s;o delug'd in tears: for if tears could mitigate my pa&s;&s;ion, mine alone would be &s;ufficient; whereas thine do but increa&s;e my torments in&s;tead of contributing relief. In brief, I was born to langui&s;h, thou to rejoyce: and therefore attend to thy Jollities, which better &s;ute to the feeblene&s;&s;e of thy Sex and to the tenderne&s;&s;e of thy years; and leave this &s;or|row to me, as more corre&s;ponding to virile for|titude, and to the proof of my con&s;tancy. For if you will deport your &s;elf otherwi&s;e, I &s;hall believe that you love me but little while&s;t you per&s;i&s;t to afflict me with your &s;adne&s;&s;e, redou|bling the grief which is of it &s;elf but too heavy to be &s;upported. Comfort thy &s;elf yet, com|fort thy &s;elf <HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> for thy con&s;olation will be a great part of my redre&s;&s;e, when I &s;hall receive thy joy as a &s;ign of the love thou beare&s;t to me.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> &s;eeing &s;he could not get any thing out of me of what &s;he de&s;ired, determined to let me alone, and inform her &s;elf better by other means. But, I having already imparted this my mi&s;|adventure (without acquainting him with the occa&s;ion) to a Knight my friend; (not &s;o much becau&s;e I held any great confidence in his fideli|ty, as becau&s;e of the vicinity of his hou&s;e to that
<PB N="33" REF="25">of my fair Enemy: con&s;idering that from every part my pains increa&s;ed, I re&s;olved to vent my pa&s;&s;ion to him afre&s;h, fancying the encounter at lea&s;t of &s;ome occa&s;ion of comforting my &s;elf &s;ometimes in the &s;ight of her, who though I did not &s;ee, yet had &s;tuck &s;o many darts of grief in my brea&s;t. I cau&s;ed him to be &s;ent for to my Chamber, and &s;eeing him &s;o compa&s;sionate of my adver&s;ities, as that he made a &s;hew he would &s;ubvert the world to relieve me; I, as one who ea&s;ily believed what I de&s;ired, &s;aid unto him.</P>
<Q><P>Friend <HI>Jer&s;us,</HI> If I go about now to di&s;cover to thee that, which I have &s;o long concealed, of my afflictions; yet believe that I am con&s;trained to it by the high confidence I hold of thy loy|alty, and the love thou beare&s;t me. Be&s;ides, if hitherto it hath been a vertue to bury my griefs in &s;ilence, at the pre&s;ent it is a vice; &s;ince, after &s;o long a &s;iege of torments, I mu&s;t yield to the a&s;&s;aults of Love and Death. And from what may I better reque&s;t &s;uccour in &s;uch angui&s;h to the di&s;traction of my tormented heart, than from thy fidelity, and from thy courte&s;ie, whil&s;t that death pur&s;ues me, and that life rather of|fends then helps me? This cruel a&s;&s;ault began (dear friend) from that day on which the father of <HI>Lucinda</HI> died, for then died in me all light of content; never knowing what truce or peace was to an anxious mind. For, Love &s;eeing me &s;o free, and di&s;engaged from his Laws, that I derided his power, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ault me with all the force of his Empire; and though vigo|rous and great was my defence, he had fought with &s;uch &s;harpne&s;&s;e and a&s;siduity, that I was
<PB N="34" REF="26">deprived of all &s;uccour of rea&s;on, or of de&s;pera|tion, and I &s;aw my &s;elf come to that pa&s;&s;e that I was forced to render my &s;elf to the di&s;cretion of his tyrannical indi&s;cretion. And if thou thinke&s;t (dear <HI>Jer&s;us</HI>) that I talking thus, am out of my right &s;en&s;es, believe me, friend, it would be the greate&s;t of my felicities to be deprived of judgement; as the greate&s;t of my infelicities comes from the knowledge of, and inability to redre&s;&s;e, my dy&s;a&s;ters: Whereas if I were de|prived of under&s;tanding, as I could hope no good, &s;o I would fear no evil; but being free from the tumults of pa&s;&s;ion, and the Wars of the &s;en&s;es, I would live full of inward tran|quillity. Behold me therefore reduced to &s;o mi&s;erable a &s;tate, that I know not whither to have recour&s;e for &s;uccour in the&s;e la&s;t minutes of my life, unle&s;&s;e to the candour of our friend|&s;hip, which, with the Arms of thy coun&s;els, and thy courte&s;ie, are able to rai&s;e from about my Soul the tedious Leaguer of my living death, and dying hopes; The adjacency of thy hou&s;e to that of my fair and inflexible Enemy, may at lea&s;twi&s;e &s;tand me in &s;o much &s;tead, as to open to me a door of e&s;cape, either by means of hope or de&s;pair. The reality of thy Amity (which in nece&s;&s;ity is be&s;t-experimented and known) may be able with the prudence of thy advice and indeavours, wholly to &s;et me free: for I know very well that thou ha&s;t more de&s;ire to gratifie me herein, then I have to entreat thee to it.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;aid, I held my peace, and <HI>Jer&s;us</HI> promptly replied; Friend <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> I might
<PB N="35" REF="26">ju&s;tly be offended at the diffidence, which thou &s;hewe&s;t to have &s;o long had of my Loyalty, concealing thy troubles from me, and revealing them ju&s;t now, when by the Laws of Love thou wa&s;t bound to &s;uppre&s;&s;e them. What ha&s;t thou got by thy &s;ilence, which hath deprived thee of the benefit thou mighte&s;t have acquired, and drawn upon thee that mi&s;chief thou did&s;t not merit? I &s;hall neverthele&s;&s;e forbear to ag|gravate thy grief with &s;uperfluous loquaci|ty, being my &s;elf but too much troubled for thy afflictions, which the &s;en&s;e of Pity and the bond of Amity hath made common to me. Thou &s;aye&s;t, The beauty of <HI>Lucinda</HI> de&s;troyes thy life, and &s;he it is doth al&s;o ruin my health; for as much then, as I know no difference be|tween my will and thine: &s;ince that thou re|quire&s;t my coun&s;el in &s;uch an exigent, a&s;&s;ure thy &s;elf that if my advice might but as much avail thee, as thy malady torments me; thou woulde&s;t immediatly be free, from all &s;en&s;e of either perplexity, or pain. Yet to tell thee my thoughts plainly, it doth a&s;toni&s;h and grieve me to think, that thou &s;houlde&s;t voluntarily con&s;ent, that the greatne&s;&s;e of thy courage &s;hould be foild and overcome by a thing &s;o weak and contemptible; and that thou which wert wont to bear the victory from the brave&s;t Cavaliers in the world, &s;hould'&s;t be overcome by a Feminine feeblene&s;&s;e. And for the further increa&s;e of my di&s;gu&s;ts, I &s;ee that thy Soul is that which fal&s;ifieth thy faith, and tenders thee in a manner a rebel to rea&s;on: for thou make&s;t thy &s;elf the mini&s;ter to thy own &s;ervitude and
<PB N="36" REF="27">calamity. Fly therefore &s;uch extreams of Love, which tran&s;port thee to an extream un|worthine&s;&s;e: not that I would have thee ba|ni&s;h it wholly from thy knowledge (there be|ing no le&s;&s;e peril in too much &s;olicitude to avoid it, then in too much a&s;&s;iduity to pur&s;ue it) but that thou e&s;teem it, fear it, &s;eek it, and contemne it with a genero&s;ity and liberty worthy of thy noble bloud, and of thy great Soul. For if Love be of it &s;elf a deceitfull af|fect, do thou al&s;o deceive him; his Laws being &s;uch, that he, who loveth lea&s;t, obtaineth the greate&s;t recompence; and who &s;erveth mo&s;t, re|ceiveth the greate&s;t ingratitude. In &s;um, I con&s;ent that thou &s;halt follow Love, but not make thy &s;elf his Slave; and that thou de&s;pi&s;e him not, but much le&s;&s;e that thou tru&s;t him at any hand. <HI>Con&s;ider that hope in ea&s;ie things deceiveth, in difficult betrayeth;</HI> and that For|tune gives an unexpected i&s;&s;ue to all humane affairs: and therefore &s;eeing it's the cau&s;e of thy &s;orrow, do thou al&s;o deceive it in making it the means of thy joy. For I a&s;&s;ure thee, if thou woulde&s;t follow my coun&s;el (now that I re|que&s;t thee) thou &s;halt ea&s;ily by this means ob|tain that, which thou &s;halt certainly lo&s;e by going to my hou&s;e; in which neverthele&s;&s;e thou art ab&s;olute ma&s;ter, when, and how thou plea|&s;e&s;t. And certainly thou ha&s;t done thy &s;elf great wrong to delay &s;o long to contribute to thy comfort: knowing that thou art more lord of my will, then I am of my own hou&s;e: and for that cau&s;e I am obliged to &s;erve thee in all oc|currences wherein I may be u&s;efull. I &s;hall
<PB N="37" REF="27">&s;ay no more, for words are fruitle&s;&s;e, where my thought is onely of comforting thee, and not to perplex thee with talk. And therefore now, if you &s;o plea&s;e, let us go to make a tryal of my Wit, and of thy Fortune.</P></Q>
<P>Thus &s;aid <HI>Jer&s;us,</HI> but while&s;t I hear'd him talk &s;o &s;ini&s;terly of <HI>Lucinda,</HI> I felt my heart e|qually to boil with di&s;dain, and my mind to freeze with &s;u&s;pition and jealou&s;ie: Yet with di&s;&s;embling &s;peeches he &s;ought to make me be|lieve that &s;uperfluity of Love would make me rave in my thoughts. So I partly di&s;tru&s;ted him, &amp; partly a&s;&s;ured my &s;elf that in regard of our an|cient friend&s;hip he would ob&s;erve that which he promi&s;ed. Seeing therefore that he had &s;o freely offered me his hou&s;e, I re&s;olved to go live there for &s;ome dayes: but I &s;oon found my &s;elf fru|&s;trated in my hopes, for with all the diligence I could po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e, I could not in all the time I &s;tayed there, come &s;o much as once to the &s;ight of her, for who&s;e &s;ake I had removed unto that Lodging. Hereupon <HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> afflicted in my pre|&s;ent peril, by the con&s;ideration of my future pain, at la&s;t inve&s;tigating the cau&s;e of my mala|dy, &s;he changed her cour&s;e of life, and without making me in the lea&s;t privy to her de&s;ign, began to frequent the hou&s;e of <HI>Lucinda,</HI> with whom &s;he had before upon &s;ome other account contra|cted friend&s;hip; &s;o that one day &s;he being ente|red into di&s;cour&s;e with her, finding her in a good humour, &s;he thus &s;pake to her.</P>
<Q><P>I intreat thee, my friend, that u&s;ing thy pru|dence thou will not blame me for that, which I am about to tell thee, pre&s;uming rather to me|rit
<PB N="38" REF="28">applau&s;e then reprehen&s;ion; whil'&s;t my com|pa&s;&s;ion of another's mi&s;ery excu&s;eth my &s;hame. Dear <HI>Lucinda,</HI> my deplorable brother <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> for his great affection to thee dayly increa&s;eth his affliction, impaireth his health, impoi&s;oning even tho&s;e remedies which &s;hould re&s;tore him to it. Not that I have the lea&s;t intimation from him of his Love, having alwayes denied the true cau&s;e of his torments: but yet I have been &s;o &s;ollicitous to &s;ift out the truth, that I have come to know, that thou onely art the cau&s;e of his mi&s;ery, and maye&s;t become the re|&s;torer of his life. I have for this rea&s;on re|&s;olved to &s;train mode&s;ty, to provide (if I can po&s;&s;ible) for his &s;afety and my &s;orrow. And I profe&s;&s;e, that if I did not &s;ee his life in danger, thou &s;houlde&s;t not have known the lea&s;t hint of my trouble. Moved therefore by a compa&s;|&s;ionate zeal for his con&s;ervation, and to redre&s;&s;e my own calamity, (becau&s;e wanting him, who in the quality of an onely brother &s;upplieth the place of my decea&s;ed Parents, I &s;hould be left &s;olitary and di&s;con&s;olate): I come to in|treat thee, that thou woulde&s;t not at once with his life, annihilate my con&s;olation, &amp; decollate our family; acquiring to thy &s;elf in&s;tead of a perpetual glory, an eternal infamy for thy cruelty and his death: for certain I am, he can|not, &s;o ill treated as he is, prolong his life be|yond the date of a few moneths. O con&s;ider, I be&s;eech thee, con&s;ider, how much thou art oblig'd to him, whil'&s;t the more thou &s;lighte&s;t him, the more he loves thee: and onely de&s;i|reth death, becau&s;e thou art di&s;plea&s;ed with his
<PB N="39" REF="28">life. Herein, while he for love of thee joyes in his torments, and none know that thou art &s;he which &s;o much afflicte&s;t him, thou art doubly ingaged to him; and therefore at la&s;t relent into commi&s;eration of his &s;o great indu|rance, and permit not his fidelity to peri&s;h by thy ingratiude. What though thou art not plea&s;ed to receive him to the honour of thy conver&s;ation, wilt not thou therefore gratify him at lea&s;t with an an&s;wer to his Letter? And if yet thou wilt not do it, by in&s;tinct of a grate|full mind towards him, yet do it, dear <HI>Luc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nda,</HI> for courte&s;ie towards me: who, in &s;o doing, of a faithfull friend that I am, thou &s;halt oblige me to become thy perpetuall &s;lave. Let it content thee that it's now two years, that I have langui&s;hed under the&s;e &s;ufferings, and re&s;tore me, &s;ince thou mai&s;t do it without trouble.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Lucinda</HI> pre&s;ently replyed: My dear friend <Q>and companion; Thou ha&s;t no ground to fear that thou ha&s;t in any kind prejudiced thy Mo|de&s;ty, whil&s;t the pitty of a Brother and the confidence of a Friend ab&s;olves thee of all &s;u&s;pition, and frees thee from all a&s;per&s;ion. For though thou ha&s;t in part offended me with thy propo&s;itions, thou ha&s;t al&s;o &s;atisfyed me with thy hone&s;t innocence: there being more cau&s;e thou &s;houlde&s;t grieve at thy brother's mi&s;|fortunes, than for any fault thou mighte&s;t commit again&s;t my per&s;on. It exceedingly grieves me that I cannot give thee the &s;ati&s;|faction which thou de&s;ire&s;t, for although the mi&s;ery of thy brother afflicts me, yet I cannot
<PB N="40" REF="29">apply my &s;elf to give him a remedy; that be|ing a thing would reflect upon my reputation, to which I ought to have greater regard than to his health. And thou art not ignorant, how much the honour of a woman is dimini&s;hed, when to &s;uccour Lovers they forget them|&s;elves. Reque&s;t me not therefore to do that, which thou can&s;t not do thy &s;elf: and I would it had plea&s;ed God, that thou did&s;t not de&s;ire of me a thing impo&s;&s;ible for my power to effect, and thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;oon &s;ee how much I love thee by my removing thy trouble. Heaven knows how oft it hath grieved me, that this my beauty hath been the occa&s;ion of &s;o much mi&s;|chief to <HI>Arnaldo:</HI> How oft I have condol'd his tears when I con&s;idered, he importuned me to a thing I could not grant. Believe me, friend; that I have a greater de&s;ire to acquit him of his maladyes, then thou ha&s;t to reque&s;t me. And if by any other means, than that of my ho|nour, I might give him ea&s;e; believe me, I would more freely offer it, than he &s;hould de|&s;ire it. But becau&s;e his acqui&s;t cannot be, but with my lo&s;s; he ought to content him&s;elf with the goodwill I con&s;erve towards him (of which I de&s;ire thee to give him a&s;&s;urance,) as al&s;o the grief I &s;uffer for the pain he indureth. Do thou al&s;o excu&s;e me, beloved <HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> if I concede not to all that thou wi&s;he&s;t; becau&s;e I am not permitted, with a <HI>Salvo</HI> to my honour, to grant thee any advantage; and re&s;t &s;ecure that in all other occurrences, thou &s;halt al|wayes find me mo&s;t ready at thy beck.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome other &s;uch like pa&s;&s;ages, <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> re|turned
<PB N="41" REF="29">to me, and to comfort me &s;aid, that &s;he came from vi&s;iting <HI>Lucinda:</HI> but hiding from me her fatal an&s;wer, &s;he wi&s;ely endeavoured to make me hope that which &s;he had been deny|ed. But perfectly perceiving by her &s;ilence, how ill &s;he had &s;ucceeded in her attempt, it came in|to my mind to penetrate yet farther into the bre&s;t of <HI>Lucinda.</HI> I fain'd therefore that I had no de&s;ire to think more of her life, &s;ince &s;he ca|red &s;o little for my duty; and prayed <HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> that the next time &s;he &s;aw her, &s;he would give her to under&s;tand this my re&s;olution, of &s;eeking for the time to come to learn to be my &s;elf, that I might not do &s;o much to my prejudice in the love of a per&s;on, that was to me &s;o ingratefull. And <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> having promi&s;ed to content me, I proceeded to in&s;truct her, punctually to ob|&s;erve that Lady's countenance and behaviour upon the reception of my me&s;&s;age; becau&s;e I could better from this then from her words, be able to comprehend the truth of her intentions: And above all, that &s;he &s;hould note well the change of colours in her face; for by them com|monly the affects of the mind, and impre&s;&s;ions of the heart do manife&s;t them&s;elves. From the manner al&s;o of her &s;peech, either deliberate, or ha&s;ty, I would have been able to draw &s;ome ob|&s;ervations of her thoughts; (for from &s;peaking with lei&s;ure or liberty, with anxiety or celeri|ty, much may be collected of another's purpo|&s;es;) which may but ill be di&s;&s;embled by the external appearance. <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> writ the&s;e adver|ti&s;ements in her memory, again&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;ee a convenient occa&s;ion to meet with <HI>Lucinda;</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="30">and finding her on a time alone, &s;he be&s;poke her in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Lucinda,</HI> if my propo&s;itions &s;hall a&s;much <Q>offend thee, as they make me blu&s;h, impute to the incon&s;tancy of humane de&s;ires this my im|portunity, occa&s;ioned for thy &s;ervice, rather then the relief of my brother: who, in &s;hort, &s;eeing that he reaped no profit of his &s;ervices, and that they encrea&s;ed thy contempt of him, hath re&s;olved to put him&s;elf upon an impo&s;&s;i|ble enterprize, which is, to cea&s;e farther to incommode thee with his amorous Pa&s;&s;ions: yet, impo&s;&s;ible as it is, he will attempt it, ma|king his ab&s;ence a medicine for thy homicide, and his death; for he hopes to obtain that by this voluntary exile, which thy pre&s;ence per|mits him not to find. But, if even thou al&s;o &s;halt con&s;ent to this re&s;olution, I a&s;&s;ure thee, friend, that I &s;hall procure my death rather then &s;urvive this misfortune. And thus I &s;hall come to be betrayed by you both, whom I &s;o much love, like mortal enemies; dying not for having offended you, but for having too much affected you. Can it be po&s;&s;ible, dear <HI>Lucinda,</HI> that thou wilt be &s;o cruel to &s;uch a fidelity as my brother profe&s;&s;eth to thee, and &s;o ingrateful to &s;uch an Amity as I bear to thee? And how can&s;t thou ever po&s;&s;e&s;s her Will entire, who&s;e Life thou rende&s;t in pieces? How can&s;t thou nouri&s;h a legitimate corre&s;pondence of friend|&s;hip with her, thou &s;o inhumanely transfixe&s;t? Oh reform at length with new Laws &s;uch thy implacable obduratene&s;s, which thou fal&s;ely calle&s;t zeal of honour, when as that Ladie doth
<PB N="43" REF="30">not in the lea&s;t offend her virtue, who corre|&s;pondeth to the legitimate Affection of a Knight, which loves, and &s;erves her according to the &s;tabli&s;hed Laws of Heaven, and Nature. I hope I pretend not to have thee decline the lea&s;t punctilio of thy virtue; but I verily be|lieve, that if thou woulde&s;t grant me what I ask, thou mighte&s;t glory in having, with a &s;mall benevolence, re&s;tored to life, two per|&s;ons otherwi&s;e dead. There is nothing doubt|le&s;s lo&s;t of thy reputation, whil&s;t thou do&s;t but prevent the perdition of a Knight that adores thee, and &s;alve the mi&s;ery of a Dame that loves thee. Make them therefore but on|ly to under&s;tand in two words, that thou art not plea&s;ed with his departure, and that thou art di&s;plea&s;ed with her di&s;pair. It is but a &s;mall matter I beg, the writing of two lines of com|plement, for the reprieve of two lives, with|out prejudicing thy &s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> concluded her di&s;cour&s;e by the commencing of her tears, giving <HI>Lucinda</HI> time to reply in this manner. <Q>I intreate thee to cea&s;e the&s;e tears, and &s;weeten the bitterne&s;s of thy grief; for I &s;hall do all I can for thy &s;a|tisfaction and comfort. But I would to God I were for the pre&s;ent without a tongue, that I might not &s;peak for love of thee a thing &s;o op|po&s;ite to rea&s;on. Thou oughte&s;t not to glory in the power that thou ha&s;t over my heart; for if in this particular I &s;hall commit any errour, thou onely art to be blam'd; having with thy loving importunity forced me to do what I would not. I &s;u&s;pend therefore my re&s;ent|ments,
<PB N="44" REF="31">that I may content thee, de&s;iring thee onely to accept my good will, and not to &s;light my gifts after thou ha&s;t once received them: it being an ordinary cu&s;tom of men, highly to e|&s;teem things difficult to attain, and de&s;pi&s;e them when gotten. I will write to <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> but look to it, that he hereafter adventures not to de&s;ire any thing farther of me; for I a&s;&s;ure thee, that by &s;eeking to make greater acqui&s;ts, he will lo&s;e what he hath acquired. For I confe&s;&s;e unto thee, that I repent already of my promi&s;e, which yet, &s;ince it plea&s;eth thee, I cannot retract.

<P>I <HI>Believe,</HI> Arnaldo, <HI>that my letter will find you more merry then it hath left me &s;ad: But thou woulde&s;t not have an occa&s;ion to complain of me, if now when I moved this hand to write, it had been dryed up, rather then render its liberty at another's per&s;wa&s;ion to give thee, not being in the lea&s;t in|debted to thee, too pretious a pledge. Yet notwith|&s;tanding, I would not have thee pre&s;ume, upon my pre&s;ent writing to thee, that it is becau&s;e thou ha&s;t been offended at my pa&s;t &s;ilence. Receive this my let|ter therefore with moderate re&s;entments: wi&s;ely di&s;|&s;embling thy joy at this thy good fortune; as thou ha&s;t done the vehemence of thy Love. And above
<PB N="45" REF="31">all, remember</HI> Arnaldo <HI>that when men go about to publi&s;h &s;uch like Victories over women, they make a &s;acrifice of their honours, expo&s;ing them to the ca|lumnies of contumelious tongues. For if thou knowe&s;t what thou &s;tande&s;t in need of, thou &s;houlde&s;t al&s;o re|member, what is fit for me to do; having alwayes in thy eye, that to comply with thee, I am become of a Lady a Slave, or rather an enemy to my &s;elf; for when thou &s;halt &s;ing of thy glory, I &s;hall be condoling of my faults. O how many times have I took my hand off from this paper with a re&s;olution not to write to thee! But ala&s;&s;e! what &s;hould &s;he do, that cannot defend her &s;elf from thy importunities? Go to, re&s;t at la&s;t from thy troubles, take a re&s;olution of thy doubts, and glory in that thou ha&s;t no more occa&s;ion of contra&s;t. I have under&s;tood by thy &s;i&s;ter, that thou wilt travel into &s;ome other Country, at which I am greatly di&s;plea&s;ed; for who cannot be in&s;trumentall to the good of another, &s;hould avoid all occa&s;ions of doing them harm. I yet (to con|fe&s;s the truth) have judged that this thy invention, is rather feigned then real: &s;o that if thou intend|e&s;t to deceive me, Loe now thou ha&s;t done it. But I mu&s;t tell thee, that in deceiving me thou ha&s;t co|&s;ened thy &s;elf: and that thou &s;halt not be a jot the better for the tricks you Lovers make u&s;e of, that you may triumph in deceiving the con&s;tancy of tho&s;e infortunate maids, that tru&s;t you. Boa&s;t not there|fore in thy &s;ubtilty, and believe me not to be &s;uch a fool, as I think thee in this particular. In &s;hort, I would have thee know, that its more out of com|pa&s;&s;ion of thy &s;ufferings, then for any fear of thy de|parture, that I am per&s;waded to write to thee: or rather for pitty of thy Si&s;ter, who&s;e &s;orrows, as evi|dences
<PB N="46" REF="32">of the torments &s;he &s;uffers for thy &s;ake, I have been no longer able to indure. Of all this I thought good to adverti&s;e thee by this my letter, with which I de&s;ire you to re&s;t content, without pretending to any further advantage: otherwi&s;e thou may&s;t chance to lo&s;e that, which for the merits of thy Si&s;ter thou ha&s;t acquired. Comfort thy &s;elf therefore within thy &s;elf, and &s;uffer me in peace; for although thy departure would di&s;plea&s;e me, I intend not never|thele&s;&s;e that thy &s;tay &s;hall turn to my prejudice: and e&s;pecially have a care it enter not into thy thoughts to de&s;ire to &s;ee, or &s;peak with me, that &s;o thy importu|nity impo&s;e not upon me a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;plea&s;ing thee afre&s;h by my denyals.

<P>THis letter being writ and delivered to my &s;i&s;ter, <HI>Lucinda</HI> withdrew, and <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> run to &s;eek me, to give it to me. I received it with the &s;ame joy, a Mi&s;er would have entertain'd a Trea&s;ure; or the Mortally-&s;ick-patient, a health|full Medicine; not being able almo&s;t to &s;uffer my &s;elf to under&s;tand this good Fortune. At la&s;t, I awaking out of my &s;tupor, <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> re|counted to me the di&s;cour&s;es held with this Fair one; the which having under&s;tood, I &s;et my &s;elf with a high attention to the reading this let|ter: but he that &s;hould have then &s;een my face &s;hining with a new colour of plea&s;antne&s;&s;e, might thereby have collected how much virtue and vivacity tho&s;e inanimate characters had in|fu&s;ed into my dead &s;oul.

<PB N="47" REF="32">of no long durance, for I did pre&s;ently prove in my &s;elf how true it was, that high &s;oring flights are near the mo&s;t precipitous falls, I being pa&s;t from a &s;upream content, to an extream de&s;pera|tion. Thus I &s;tood a good &s;pace, fighting be|tween joy and grief, without knowing to which part to betake me; for when I thought to take heart, the little hope I had did not permit me; and if I thought of afflicting my &s;elf, the good will I &s;eemed to &s;ee in <HI>Lucinda,</HI> did not &s;uffer me. Wanting therefore the coun&s;el of others, I re&s;olved to an&s;wer her Letter in the&s;e words.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Arnaldo <HI>to</HI> Lucinda.</HEAD>
<P>LUcinda, <HI>your Letter brought in its fir&s;t ap|pearance an inexplicable plea&s;ure. But the joy I took in &s;eeing it, is vani&s;hed in reading it, by the re|turn of a greater confu&s;ion of &s;adne&s;&s;e. Thus that Pa|per which [&s;ealed] promi&s;ed me remedy, [open] con|firm'd me in my mi&s;ery: &s;o that judging by it of your intention, I &s;aw my ruin nearer then my relief. But if,</HI> Lucinda, <HI>you write to me, how that you compa&s;|&s;ionate my misfortunes, wherefore do you all you can to afflict me? your words corre&s;pond not with your actions; but as crafty as you are, you at the &s;ame time thru&s;t me away with your heart, and flat|ter me with hope; and be&s;peak your &s;elf re&s;olved never to put an end to my torments, but with my death. Wherefore u&s;e you &s;uch di&s;&s;imulation with him that adores you? Ah!</HI> Lucinda, <HI>I had far ra|ther that you were doubtfull of my &s;ufferings, then that believing them you &s;hould not &s;eek to remove them. And what am I the better for your advice,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="33">To u&s;e your favours moderately, <HI>if you your &s;elf cancell and provoke them, in the &s;ame in&s;tant you be&s;tow them? If you were but as willing to cure my maladies, as I have been patient to undergo them, my Pa&s;&s;ion would not have any thing in it wherewith to torment me: I having alwayes veiled my flames with a perpetual &s;ilence; whereas your favours come &s;o difficultly from you, that almo&s;t as &s;oon as they are born they langui&s;h to my greater prejudice. If therefore it be true that you de&s;ire my &s;atisfaction, depo&s;e your &s;everity: if you would that I &s;hould be|lieve you, lay a&s;ide this di&s;&s;imulation. Content your &s;elf that you have robbed me of the better part of my life, and that I am now running upon my own ac|cord to death, without de&s;iring me by the&s;e fallacious hopes to prolong my life, to endure every minute a centuplicated death. In &s;hort, &s;ince the more my faithfulne&s;&s;e &s;hews it &s;elf, the further I am from my reward, and you have re&s;olv'd that I die; die I will. And becau&s;e that in this place, &s;eeing my &s;elf &s;o afflicted by your cruelty, I cannot behold others jollity without a multiplied and Tantalizing torment; I will go die in a place &s;o remote from all humane conver&s;ation, that the name of</HI> Arnaldo <HI>&s;hall never arive to the notice of any man.

<P>I Return'd this an&s;wer to the fair <HI>Lucinda,</HI> but never received the lea&s;t counter-&s;ign, either of repul&s;e, or acceptation of my reque&s;t. I had therefore recour&s;e anew to the help of <HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> to the end &s;he might obtain me a favour &s;o pa&s;&s;io|natly de&s;ired. She went to her, though with &s;ome blu&s;hings; and after many words forced her to be content to let me &s;ee her in a certain place of great re&s;ort, where as if talking with my &s;i&s;ter I might meet her, without &s;u&s;pition of any cor|re&s;pondency.</P>
<P>The day and hour appointed being come, what I &s;aid, and did, in that incounter may be more ea&s;ily imagined then expre&s;t. I am &s;ure, I felt all the time of that expectation &s;o great a content|ment, that my mi&s;ery changed into felicity, for &s;o much de&s;ired, and &s;o little hoped for a victo|ry. In &s;um, &s;o jocund apprehen&s;ions did at that time rejoyce my mind, that although I had nothing, I did not de&s;ire a more advantagious Fortune. Now judge you, deare&s;t Stranger, what joy I found, and felt then in &s;peaking to <HI>Lucinda</HI> of my pains, and by &s;upplicating her to have pi|ty
<PB N="50" REF="34">on me, and to give me at la&s;t &s;ome hone&s;t re|compence for my con&s;tant fidelity. Our di&s;|cour&s;es though they were not long were many, and we came to this conclu&s;ion; That I &s;hould not &s;tir from thence, and much le&s;&s;e that I &s;hould let any one know my intere&s;t in her per&s;on. Ala&s;s! I &s;ee now that this was a plot of her wonted Feminine di&s;&s;imulation, that &s;he alwayes de&s;ired &s;ecre&s;ie in Love; and in vain did I com|fort my &s;elf in it: and yet it was no other then a mark of her unfaithfull mind, that being not yet arrived to the end &s;he de&s;igned for my ultimate de&s;truction; &s;he would not have my departure deprive her of the friend&s;hip of my &s;i&s;ter, whom &s;he u&s;ed, to deceive me; nor that the publication of my pledge, &s;hould di&s;credit the ba&s;ene&s;&s;e of her intentions, whil'&s;t &s;lighting a per&s;onage of Regal Extract, &s;he &s;et her affections upon a Knight of vulgar Birth and Fortune. Such ma|lice lodg'd in the heart of a young Lady, To de|ceive him that lov'd her, to betray him that ador'd her.</P>

<P>THus &s;aying, the Knight &s;igh'd from the bot|tom of his Soul, and holding his peace &s;ome &s;pace, he continued his di&s;cour&s;e in this manner. Deare&s;t Gue&s;t! already the Sun hath a&s;cended half of his Carier above the Horizon; it would
<PB N="51" REF="34">be therefore good coun&s;el, for this time not to weary you with the Narration of my &s;ini&s;ter ad|ventures, but that in the umbrage of the&s;e meadows we do a little refre&s;h langui&s;hing na|ture. Having &s;carce &s;o &s;aid, he with a little &s;il|ver-whi&s;tle gave intimation to his people of what he de&s;ired, and that Forre&s;t was in a &s;hort &s;pace peopled by the noble attendants of the Knight. Where, near a Fountain by him made in that part, (it being his own ground) with black mar|bles, &s;adned by the repre&s;entation of tragical oc|currences, the Table was prepared. Here <HI>Ar|naldo</HI> having by the mirth of the banquet, and by the plea&s;antne&s;&s;e of the place given way to &s;ome &s;entiments of delight, began to ask me of the news of the world, and of the principal Courts of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Kingdoms. And the fir&s;t that appeared on the &s;cene of our di&s;cour&s;e was the Duke of <HI>Sparta,</HI> with whom having had &s;ome familiarity in the quality of Senators, he admired to hear him ri&s;en by the help of his Enemies to &s;uch a Grandure. It is not to be wondred at, &s;aid I, becau&s;e when Heaven will puni&s;h men for their faults, it is &s;o ordered, that the in&s;truments of the offence are changed to them into in&s;truments of cha&s;ti&s;ement. The impieties of former Princes have been &s;o high, that they mixed the Antidotes with the poy&s;on of their Crimes. Wo be to the world, &s;aid <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> if the like mea&s;ure &s;hould &s;ucceed in all Principalities. And yet (added I) it &s;eems the pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e ages do authori&s;e this verity with a manife&s;t proof. Behold <HI>Thrace,</HI> with its King murthered &amp; &s;trangled! Behold <HI>Macedon</HI> without legitimate Heirs, with <HI>Migdonia,</HI> &amp; <HI>The&s;|&s;aly</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="35">revolted from the Crown. Con&s;ider <HI>Ep rus,</HI> turned up&s;ide down with the ambition of tho&s;e which the intere&s;ts of State, and the ob&s;tinacy of the late King, made to be ingrafted (inju&s;tly, as being Ba&s;tards) into the &s;tem of the bloud Royal. Turn your eies to the Princes of <HI>Illyrium;</HI> who be|ing exiled, depre&s;&s;ed, &amp; extinct in the prime flower of their greatne&s;&s;es, all that va&s;t Province is de|&s;olate, and burnt up by the fierce&s;t flames of War. And, cro&s;sing the Seas, behold <HI>Cyprus</HI> with its Princes exterminated, (a barbari&s;m unus'd through all ages) even by the hand of the infa|mous Hang-man: and, thence running through all the Provinces of our Climate, ye will find but-too-Authentick to the detriment of many people, this Maxim, <HI>That the in&s;truments of evils, are turned by the ju&s;tice of heaven into in&s;truments of cha&s;ti&s;ements to Delinquents.</HI> The Knight &s;tood &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended at this my Di&s;cour&s;e; but I, that again&s;t my will had &s;et my thoughts and Di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;uch &agrave; Subject; took occa&s;ion from thence to divert my talk, and commended the goodly fountain (which did &s;pout out of the Horn of an <HI>Acteon,</HI> transformed into a Stag) its &s;parkling Cry&s;tals, &s;aying: Now that we treat of the mi&s;chiefs, which &s;o much at pre&s;ent &s;courge our Kingdoms; I know not courteous Sir, whe|ther you have ever made reflexion on this other truth, That all the evils of men ordinarily take ri&s;e from women, nor &s;o much from the bad as from the good; whence, with rea&s;on, a noble Wit w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">it,

<L>As from the <HI>Spattan-whore's</HI> adulteries.</L></Q></P>
<P>Yea, verily, I have con&s;idered (an&s;wered <HI>Ar|naldo</HI>) that almo&s;t all the evils, which at pre&s;ent pe&s;ter our Kingdoms, if they be well regarded will be found to take their birth from women. It's a high con&s;ideration, &s;aid I, and worthy of the &s;ublimene&s;&s;e of your Ingenuity. But, with your leave, let us onely ob&s;erve what is repre&s;ented to us, in the gracefull Statue which dignifieth this regal Forre&s;t: and it is, that the major part of the calamities of men take their birth as did that of <HI>Acteon,</HI> from the curio&s;ity of looking on other mens wives, and from the wickedne&s;&s;e withall of tho&s;e Females, that Metamorphi&s;e their hu&s;|bands into <HI>Acteons.</HI> It is very right, &s;aid the Knight; <HI>Nor hath the Ju&s;tice of Heaven a heavier &s;courge for mortals then that of Feminine wickednes:</HI> while men in the mean time on the other &s;ide, by no other way &s;o head-&s;trongly rebel again&s;t Heaven, as by the Love of women. Of which, though from a divers cau&s;e, I can render you mo&s;t ample te&s;timony, &s;ince that having with &s;o much fidelity Idolized my unfaithfull <HI>Lucinda,</HI> in all that time I lived in &s;uch a dotage, I never re|membred either heaven, or my &s;elf; and I am now reduced by her means after a thou&s;and deaths of intolerable dy&s;a&s;ters, to live a life more painfull then death.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aid the Knight; when, upon the in&s;tant, hearing a mighty noy&s;e in the Forre&s;t, we all &s;et
<PB N="54" REF="36">our &s;elves to gue&s;s what might occa&s;ion it. The &s;er|vants of the Cavalier had already catch't up their Arms for our defence, when we beheld to rou&s;e on the left &s;ide of the Fountain a goodly Stag, of an extraordinary bigne&s;&s;e, which in a full carier fled the eminent peril, threatned him from the per&s;ecutions of a Huntre&s;&s;e. But &s;tumbling up|on &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els for the &s;ervice of the Table, which &s;tood in the entrance of that Track, he hapned to fall precipitou&s;ly into a little pit of the Meadow, where the Huntre&s;&s;e over-took him, and &s;tuck two mortal darts into his flank and head, with &s;uch a dexterity that like lightning at the drawing of the Bow they vani&s;h'd. Having made the blow, the beautifull La&s;&s;e ca&s;t her eyes on the Table, and congi'd with a gentle &s;mile, dying the face of the Knight with a noble blu&s;h; and began to proceed on her way. But <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> ri&s;ing to an&s;wer her courteous Salute, with great affability intreated her to &s;it down, to take with us a &s;hort repa&s;t, after that her victorious cha&s;e. The Dam&s;el turned about, &s;miling with a grace able to inchant Souls with Love, and &s;aid; Some great prodigy is hapned in the world, now that the Enemy of conver&s;ation invites Strangers to his Table. But I cannot receive the honour you exhibit to me, being expected by my company on the other &s;ide the River to Dinner. <HI>Arnaldo</HI> in|terrupted her. You will arive too late, it being above three miles off; but if you will plea&s;e to favour us with a &s;hort &s;tay, we will al&s;o wait up|on you thither. I give you humbly thanks, re|plied the &s;prightly Virago; but that would be too much trouble for you, to pa&s;&s;e beyond the con|fines
<PB N="55" REF="36">which inclo&s;e you in this &s;alvage habitati|on. But it's a good prediction, that &s;eeing gue&s;ts now with you in &s;trange garbs, I may think, that you will at la&s;t put an end to this inhu|mane &s;olitude, which deprives the world of the glory of your per&s;on. This &s;aying, with ex|pre&s;&s;ions equally free and generous, &s;he bore us company at dinner, and out of temperance &s;carce ta&s;ted any of the di&s;hes, taking a little cup of water from the fountain, to &s;hew how little our nature is content with, and how the worth of women is inhanced by their ab&s;ti|nence. This done, &s;he took her leave, and would not by any means &s;uffer either the Knight or his &s;ervants to accompany her, onely &s;aying, She recommended the prey to him; for being taken in his juri&s;diction. The fair Hun|tre&s;&s;e being gone, I was even dead with de&s;ire to know her Quality: for the air of her looks, and the freene&s;&s;e of her deportment, made me plainly perceive, &s;he was more then a meer <HI>Denizon</HI> of the forre&s;t; but the Knight fore&s;ee|ing my curio&s;ity, which peradventure he read in my eyes, he obligingly &s;aid; Behold, mo&s;t dear gue&s;t, our di&s;cour&s;e confirmed with a new proof, that from women, and from good women, are occa&s;ioned all the calamities of men; &s;ince for &s;o courteous, virtuous, and innocent a Maid, many per&s;ons are at this in&s;tant endangered, and many families ruined.</P>
<P>This fair young-one was born in the I&s;le of <HI>Negroponte,</HI> of a very noble family, and con|joyned by kindred to the Royal blood. Being grown to fourteen years of age, her parents dy|ed,
<PB N="56" REF="37">and &s;he remained with three &s;i&s;ters more, un|der the tyrannicall government of her brethren; who having de&s;igned her again&s;t her will, and contrary to all rea&s;on, to a manner of life little plea&s;ing to her, as being a lover of Liberty, did thereby occa&s;ion to them&s;elves extream misfor|tunes. She was for her &s;ingular beauty loved and de&s;ired, by the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Gallants, and noble&s;t Knights of that Court: but &s;he, (yet neverthele&s;&s;e with a &s;oul truly generous in &s;o young a Ladie) did not &s;cornfully de&s;pi&s;e, but courteou&s;ly refu&s;e the &s;ervice of all the o|ther Cavaliers; declaring her &s;elf to like onely the Services of <HI>Calli&s;thenes,</HI> a young Gallant, noble of blood, and more noble for ingenuity; but of &s;o &s;lender a Fortune, that he could &s;carce &s;u&s;tain in any &s;plendor, the Nobility tran&s;mit|ted him from his Ance&s;tors. This application of the Dam&s;el, highly di&s;plea&s;ed the Brothers; for having already advantagiou&s;ly marryed the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, they de&s;igned to bury her, together with the&s;e younger, according to the u&s;e of tho&s;e parts, in the perpetuall &s;olitude of a &s;eclu&s;e life in the Country, with a title incapable of the marriage-freedoms. Nor did they long defer this their tyrannicall re&s;olution, having con|fined the fair <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> and the other innocent creatures, in a hou&s;e built upon the top of a mountain, in a &s;ituation almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, being incircled on every &s;ide with forre&s;ts and mountains of their own juri&s;diction. Hither <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> being come, in&s;tead of attending the imployments abhorred by her genius, &s;he began, like a new <HI>Diana</HI> of tho&s;e woods, with
<PB N="57" REF="37">her bow and boar-&s;pear, to di&s;turb the peace of the wild bea&s;ts, which in great abundance &s;hel|tred them&s;elves in that &s;olitary and de&s;art place: being content, though ab&s;ent from her beloved <HI>Calli&s;thenes,</HI> with that manner of life, in which yet at lea&s;t &s;he &s;atisfied the naturall incli|nations of her generous freedom, being far from idlene&s;s the fomenter of vain thoughts, in the tender youth of Maids. And this her life al&s;o di&s;|plea&s;ed her brothers, which would have her in e|very thing conformed to their capriccio's, to re|move from her all hopes of marriage: The young <HI>Virago</HI> &s;eeing her &s;elf per&s;ecuted al&s;o in that hon|e&s;t liberty, and not brooking upon any terms to be deprived of that freedom of mind the hea|vens had granted her, conceited, inexpert as &s;he was, that the onely flying into &s;ome other part, would in&s;tate her into &s;uch a benefit. So having before in her hunting acquainted her &s;elf with the tracks of tho&s;e forre&s;ts, &s;he got away one day with an old &s;hepherde&s;&s;e from her other &s;i|&s;ters, and, di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of a young &s;hep|herd, made towards the &s;ea-&s;hoar; where, in a little fi&s;her-boat, &s;he cro&s;t the Straits, di&s;|imbarking in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and accidentally met upon the coa&s;ts a company of Ladies, which there entertained the time in di&s;ports: And &s;he arri|ved in &s;o fortunate an hour, that, liking well the deportment of <HI>Olympia,</HI> an antient Lady, and free al&s;o from all the Laws of Matrimony, &s;he di&s;covered to her the &s;ecret of her quality, in|treating her privacy and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Olympia,</HI> be|ing taken with the noble confidence of the Maid, carried her to <HI>Thebes,</HI> the place of her abode,
<PB N="58" REF="38">and took her into the place of a daughter: and the greate&s;t part of her Dowry, lying within the circumference of this my Forre&s;t, &s;he often cometh hither with <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> delighting much, to &s;ee her with &s;uch a freedom and cou|rage to war with the wild-bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>But the Brothers mi&s;t their Si&s;ter, ju&s;t at the in&s;tant that <HI>Calli&s;thenes,</HI> either for de&s;peration of &s;eeing his Prince&s;&s;e condemned to that &s;oli|tude, or for the intere&s;t of his &s;tudy, and chiefly by the impul&s;e of his de&s;tiny, was gone to <HI>Athens;</HI> they judged fal&s;ely, that &s;he was fled with him, and which was yet wor&s;e, for to mar|ry her &s;elfe, according to her inclinations. Here|upon, of three that were there, they commiting to <HI>Ari&s;theus</HI> the &s;econd of them, the care of re|venging upon the innocent <HI>Cali&s;thenes</HI> the pre|tended injury, he pa&s;t immediatly to <HI>Athens;</HI> and &s;eeking of <HI>Cali&s;thenes,</HI> he happened to his ill fortune, to encounter him ju&s;t as he was en|tering into the hou&s;e of the Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Ma|cedonia,</HI> where he, and his three A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates fell upon him in the dark to murther him. <HI>Cali&s;the|nes,</HI> which would have expected any thing in the world, rather than to &s;ee his enemy <HI>Ari|&s;theus,</HI> being taken unprovided, he recommend|ed his &s;afety to his flight, but in vain; for be|ing &s;truck by the ruffians with two &s;tabbs, one in the &s;ide, another in the head, he fell upon the thre&s;hold of the hou&s;e; where in a &s;hort &s;pace he expired, an innocent <HI>Victim</HI> of the guiltle&s;&s;e <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> In the interim the whole family of the Emba&s;&s;ador making thither at that noi&s;e, and &s;eeing the Law of Nations violated,
<PB N="59" REF="38">which held the per&s;ons and hou&s;es of publick Mini&s;ters in &s;acred veneration, they fell upon <HI>Ari&s;theus</HI> and his confederates, with &s;uch re&s;o|lution, that though they long defended them|&s;elves, they al&s;o became a &s;acrifice to the be|trayed <HI>Cali&s;thenes.</HI> The news of this Tragedy pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>Negroponte,</HI> the Father and Faction of <HI>Cali&s;thenes,</HI> though far inferiour to that of the Brethren of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> rai&s;ed again&s;t them notwith&s;tanding &s;o fierce a tempe&s;t of civill war, that they proceeded almo&s;t to the &s;ubduing that great City; but at la&s;t the families of <HI>Cali|&s;thenes,</HI> and the confederates with their parents were extirpated, and her younger brother al&s;o &s;lain; a great part of whom, have been ever &s;ince bani&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed over all <HI>Greece.</HI> And the&s;e &s;o deplorable mi&s;eries, took begin|ning from this one prodigious Creature, &s;he having not any way contributed to it, unle&s;&s;e by a nece&s;&s;ary flight to con&s;erve the liberty of her mind.</P>
<P>Here the Knight held his peace, and I repli'd; But if an innocent Dam&s;el be the occa&s;ion of &s;o many mi&s;chiefs, Of what ruines may not a lewd woman make her &s;elf the in&s;trument? <HI>Lucinda</HI> may in part te&s;tifie it, added <HI>Arnaldo:</HI> Though yet (Heaven be prai&s;ed) &s;he hath been more un|wi&s;e than unfaithfull; for if &s;he had been onely ungratefull to me, I had had no cau&s;e of com|plaint, Ingratitude being a Dowry in&s;eparable from her Sex in &s;uch a degree, <HI>That women al|wayes love tho&s;e that &s;light them, and abhor tho&s;e that adore them.</HI> But &s;he de&s;iring for her own de&s;igns to add &s;ubtilty to her infidelity; &s;he
<PB N="60" REF="39">happened to plot a mi&s;erable ruine, not &s;o much to the prejudice of me, as to the detriment of Her &s;elf, and her Lover. Here the dinner end|ed: The Knight aro&s;e from the table; and with a gentle pace took a walk under the &s;hades of the Forre&s;t, through the &s;ame track which was made ju&s;t before by <HI>Argo&s;thenia:</HI> and I &s;eeing him taken up, would not with my curio&s;ity in|terrupt his contemplations, but left him; when he him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to continue the Tragicall narration of his amorous adventures. Pro|ceeding thus.</P>
<P>After I had parted from <HI>Lucinda,</HI> with ha|ving for a &s;upreme favour ki&s;t her hand, I was in &s;o jocund an humour, as that if I had at that in&s;tant the Empire of the whole Univer&s;e, (and, I know, perfect Lovers will believe me) offered me in lieu of my contentment, I would have parted with it for the one half of my &s;atisfacti|on. Whereupon <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> al&s;o taking comfort in my contentment, for the better continuing it, &s;he intreated me to go, for &s;ome dayes, to a Country-Seat of hers, but a league di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Thebes:</HI> whither, becau&s;e the place was very convenient for hunting and hawking, &s;he &s;ent many Falcons, to try if this new exer|ci&s;e, joyned with the favor received from <HI>Lu|cinda,</HI> had been able to re&s;tore me to my former health and &s;trength. I entertained the time a few dayes in this retirement, beyond mea&s;ure &s;ati&s;|fied with the courte&s;ie &s;hewed me by <HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> who inve&s;tigated all the means po&s;&s;ible to make me merry; but it was for no long time, in regard the Fates ordained the moments of my
<PB N="61" REF="39">joy to be &s;hort, and the continuance of my mi|&s;ery to be la&s;ting. It hapned therefore, that I be|ing to go out one morning very early a Hunting; while&s;t I prepared my &s;elf to mount my Hor&s;e, &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter Auguries would have predicted to me the vicinity of my misfortune: for the morn|ing, of clear and &s;erene became on a &s;udden clou|dy and dark; and a Gray hound which I loved ex|ceedingly ran between my Legs, and began a dreadfull howling. But I, that was now all jo|cund, and frollick for the favours received from <HI>Lucinda,</HI> valued not a &s;traw all the&s;e pre&s;ages, but would pur&s;ue my enterprize: and took a Falcon on my fi&s;t, and rid abroad into the fields: And here I was &s;uddenly &s;urprized with a &s;trange &s;hi|vering at the remembrance, that from the time of my being in the hou&s;e of <HI>Jer&s;on</HI> till then, he had fled my company, and look't &s;trangely on me. And as I did think that the melancholly life I led, might have e&s;tranged him from my familiari|ty, I yet felt &s;ome confu&s;ed impre&s;&s;ions of ter|rour in my Soul, which pointed at &s;ome thing of more &s;ini&s;ter adventure.</P>
<P>Now while I &s;tood mu&s;ing in this conceit, my poor Falcon fell dead from my hand to the ground and now I was certain that this Omen foretold me &s;ome great evil touching this my friend; remembring at the &s;ame time, with more then ordinary compa&s;sion, the yelling my Gray-hound made in the morning. And here|upon I de&s;ired to return back to the hou&s;e; when, (I know not how) I lo&s;t my way, and, ca&s;ually lighting upon a little hillet, I di&s;covered a rural habitation of <HI>Lucinda</HI>'s, from whence I thought I
<PB N="62" REF="40">heard a murmuring noi&s;e of Mu&s;ical In&s;tru|ments, which reverberating in the concave of tho&s;e Mountains, &s;ent forth different Eccho's: Which thing &s;eemed very &s;trange to me in the hou&s;e of a maiden-Lady, e&s;pecially in that &s;ea|&s;on, and in &s;uch a place. Thereupon, with my Soul more then ever clouded by the pa&s;sion of &s;orrow which afflicted me, I came back at the &s;hutting in of night to the hou&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter. Who u&s;ing at other times to meet me at the in|ner porch, was not now any where to be &s;een. I hereupon went to &s;eek her in her Chamber, where I found her &s;o dejected and &s;ad that &s;he could not utter a word. And I, in like manner, &s;eeing her in that &s;tate, dur&s;t not ask her any thing, being fearfull of under&s;tanding &s;ome di&s;|plea&s;ing news. Yet at la&s;t, forced by Love, and my obligements, I intreated her to acquaint me with the occa&s;ion of &s;o unaccu&s;tomed, and pro|found a melancholy. At which &s;he began &s;o ve|hemently to weep, that it was not po&s;sible for her of a long time to &s;peak di&s;tinctly. But yet the extreamity of her grief being in part di|mini&s;hed, by the vent &s;he gave it in her tears, in the end &s;he &s;aid; My deare&s;t brother, <HI>Jer&s;on</HI> and <HI>Lucinda</HI> have a&s;&s;a&s;sinated us both, <HI>Jer&s;on</HI> having long &s;erved me, with pretext of obtaining me, (for other way he knew he had none) through the merit of thy friend&s;hip and of Love to mar|ry him; hath betrayed me to e&s;pou&s;e <HI>Lucinda:</HI> And <HI>Lucinda,</HI> now when &s;he &s;eemed mo&s;t com|placent to thee, hath mo&s;t perfidiou&s;ly deceived thee to marry <HI>Jer&s;on.</HI> And &s;o we are both wound|ed in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part of our reputation;
<PB N="63" REF="40">without po&s;sibility of pretending to a &s;atisfa|ction equivalent to &s;uch an injury. When I under&s;tood this news, <HI>Beli&s;a</HI> being able no lon|ger to continue her di&s;cour&s;e, I interrupted her with &s;o profound &s;ighs &amp; &s;hrieks, that I thought thereby to breathe out my dolorous Soul. And I verily believe, that 'tis impo&s;sible for a man to die of &s;orrow, &s;ince I am able to live under the afflictions of &s;uch di&s;graces. Yet indeed I was wounded with what re&s;embled death. Anon af|ter I returned to my &s;elf, and rent the Letter &s;ent me by the inflexible <HI>Lucinda</HI> into a thou&s;and bits, entring into &s;uch de&s;peration, that even to the tearing my hair from my head, I committed the mo&s;t indecent acts of womani&s;h weakne&s;&s;e: it being but too true, <HI>That a Soul overpa&s;&s;ionate in the love of a woman, changeth his manly courage into effeminate cowardice.</HI> I forbare for &s;ome dayes to efface this grief out of my brea&s;t, till I might a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf of &s;ome con&s;tant re&s;olu|tion.

<P>WHen Arms had been thus denounced a|gain&s;t me, I went to the King, to whom having related my cau&s;e, and the treachery of <HI>Jer&s;on,</HI> he freely granted me the field. The day
<PB N="66" REF="42">de&s;tined to the battle being come, we both pre|&s;ented our &s;elves before the King, and took the wonted Oath, and our Arms being view'd by the Judges, we entred into the Li&s;t: where we en|countred in our Carier with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that we ea&s;ily knew the little advantage we &s;hould get of each other. <HI>Jer&s;on</HI> therefore, be|ing no le&s;&s;e dextrous than skilfull in hor&s;-man|&s;hip, a&s;&s;aulted me on the arme that was naked, giving me a dangerous wound I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I &s;truck him onely on the Vi&s;our of his Cask without doing him any hurt. Yet neverthele&s;&s;e the Launces flew in pieces: then we pre&s;ently took our &s;words, and began to a&s;&s;ault one ano|ther with &s;uch re&s;olution, and our fight endured &s;o long, that the eyes of the Spectators were as weary of beholding us, as we were with fighting. Yet in the end the lot fell in favour of the right, and <HI>Jer&s;on</HI> was di&s;mounted and &s;lain: and &s;o <HI>Lu|cinda</HI>'s infidelity came to be known, and my cau&s;e approved. Yet neverthele&s;&s;e, e&s;teeming his own honour, and that of his hou&s;e, more than life, he would not in any ca&s;e confe&s;&s;e his default, but preferred a valiant death before a &s;hamefull and di&s;honourable life. Thus <HI>Lucinda</HI> in the &s;pace of a moneth after her marriage, made in my con|tempt, and to the betraying of my &s;i&s;ter, became a Widow, <HI>Jer&s;on</HI> was cha&s;ti&s;ed, I a Conquerour, right was vindicated, and infidelity puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Here the Knight having &s;tayed his di&s;cour&s;e, I congratulated with him &s;o glorious a victory obtained over &s;o perfidious, together with &s;o valiant, an Enemy. Then the Cavalier &s;igh'd from the bottom of his heart, and &s;aid. Too dear I
<PB N="67" REF="42">paid, Noble Stranger, for &s;o famous a victory; for in acquiring to my &s;elf the applau&s;e of valour, I came to procure an infinite deal of &s;orrow: having eternally lo&s;t her whom I hoped to win in &s;o great a field of courage and fidelity. For, not being yet cured of my infirmity, I made over|tures by divers friends &amp; kinsfolks (&s;o was I in|amoured on her) to <HI>Lucinda,</HI> that entreating &s;he would pardon the offence done her upon the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of honour again&s;t my will, &s;he would con|&s;ent (though now &s;he was not worthy of my bed and company) to receive me in the room of her decea&s;ed Con&s;ort. To which being alwayes aver&s;e, &s;he &s;hut her ears, &s;etling her &s;elf in this cruel approbation, not onely of not gratifying me with marriage, but of not &s;urviving her be|loved <HI>Jer&s;on.</HI> Seeing therefore that I &s;pent all my attempts in vain, I would for my la&s;t proof, and ultimate di&s;grace, make u&s;e of the per&s;on of <HI>Beli&s;a:</HI> Who, though &s;he was very unwilling, yet knew not how to deny at my reque&s;t to &s;eek to &s;o ill-beloved a woman, but try'd to &s;ee if at her entreaty &s;he would receive me into favour; which, be&s;ides bloud, and fortune, having al&s;o made my &s;elf a known Superiour in valour to her decea&s;ed husband, I was not doubtle&s;&s;e un|worthy in a &s;econd place to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e her affecti|ons. <HI>Lucinda</HI> under&s;tanding by the mouth of <HI>Be|li&s;a</HI> &s;uch like remon&s;trances, &s;he di&s;turbedly &s;aid to her: My friend, follow me, and I will give you the an&s;wer you require of me: So they went together to a building of the Ladies, &s;eparated from the common offices of life, and, entring the &s;ame according to the freedom of our Countreys,
<PB N="68" REF="43">they came ju&s;t into that part, where <HI>Jer&s;on</HI> lay enterr'd in the hereditary Sepulcher of her greate&s;t Ance&s;tors, founders of that &s;tructure.

<P>See the nuptials prepared me by your brother! And that &s;aying, with a &s;harp Dagger which &s;he carried hid in her &s;lieve, &s;he barbarou&s;ly &s;tabb'd her &s;elf in the brea&s;t, to tranfix in her life my Soul, and the comfort of all my hopes. She did not die pre&s;ently, yet did not &s;urvive many hours, &s;o de&s;perate was her re&s;olution to be a perpetual companion in death of him, who&s;e company &s;he had enjoyed but few hours in life. The horror of &s;uch a &s;pectacle, put &s;uch affliction and terror into the mind of <HI>Beli&s;a,</HI> that it being accompanied with the fear of &s;eeing me al&s;o fall in her, as not de&s;iring to &s;urvive this her death, &s;he fell into a deep &s;wound, in which &s;he long continued, like one really dead; &amp; being not able to re&s;i&s;t &s;o great a dy&s;a&s;ter, &s;he al&s;o ended the cour&s;e of her dayes with a &s;hort fickne&s;&s;e, in the mo&s;t goodly flower of her youth, and hath left me Heir of a perpetual death; few nights pa&s;&s;ing me in which &s;he comes not to di&s;quiet my &s;leep with horrid apparitions and di&s;cour&s;es of death. I think therefore that the end of my calamity is not far off; for but ye&s;terday &s;he appeared to me about break of day, telling me, that there would arrive at my hou&s;e, (and you are the deare&s;t Gue&s;t) from the We&s;tern parts a Stranger, which would one day tran&s;mit to the memory of Po&s;te|rity

<P>HEre &s;topt the Knight, and I &s;ubjoyned. I would have you hope for more fortunate Auguries, which not my arrival in the&s;e parts, but the benignity of de&s;tiny &s;hall pre&s;ent you with, gentle Sir; which is that which the information you have given me, hath ju&s;t now infu&s;ed into my mind of the beautifull Huntre&s;&s;e, through who&s;e tracks we now direct our &s;teps. For if I deceive not my &s;elf in the little knowledge I have taken, more from the experience of Mun|dane revolutions, than the &s;tudy of any ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ciences; I &s;ee not onely in your looks, but read al&s;o in the internal tablet of your heart a mar|vellous corre&s;pondency of Genius between your noble per&s;on, and that of <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> And, Who knoweth but that <HI>Heaven,</HI> which <HI>by the means of women hath effected the greate&s;t benefits in the World;</HI> hath &s;ent this fair Stranger out of <HI>Ne|gropont</HI> into <HI>Baeotia,</HI> for no other end but by the a&s;si&s;tance of her per&s;on to terminate your &s;uf|ferings; taking you from this dolefull &s;olitude wherein you are unprofitable to others, and a burden to your &s;elf, to tran&s;port you to a place,
<PB N="70" REF="44">and e&s;tate worthy of the dignity of your bloud, and the grandure of your mind?</P>
<P>Here the Knight &s;tedfa&s;tly beheld me with &s;i|lent &s;eriou&s;ne&s;&s;e, letting loo&s;e unawares many profound things; whereupon I pro&s;ecuted my di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aying. <HI>Negropont</HI> already bewails the ruine of the &s;tock of its <HI>Princes,</HI> reduced into the &s;ole per&s;on of <HI>Doricinia: Periander,</HI> elder bro|ther of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> to whom by primogeniture that inheritance doth belong, hath given the final period to that family: For, rebelling in an amorous di&s;dain again&s;t the Durche&s;&s;e, who ei|ther to con&s;erve her &s;elf free and independent, would not marry; or for that &s;he knew <HI>Periander</HI> to be of too turbulent a <HI>Genius,</HI> and two tyran|nical a di&s;po&s;ition, had refu&s;ed to make him her husband; he hath for the &s;ame merited exile from <HI>Negropont,</HI> as a reward of his in&s;urrections; and according to the report, which goes of him is dead in the I&s;le of <HI>Andros,</HI> whither he had be|took him&s;elf with the deplorable Reliques of his Rebellion. The elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter likewi&s;e of <HI>Argo&s;the|nia</HI> is without any of the fruits of her Matrimo|ny: &s;o that if Heaven permit that al&s;o the Dutche&s;&s;e &s;hould run the great Carier of death without legitimate i&s;&s;ue; the government of that Noble principality would de&s;cend directly to <HI>Argo&s;thenia:</HI> And what would you &s;ay, gentle Sir, if you, changing your fortune with the mu|tation of your life, &s;hould pa&s;&s;e, by the means of &s;o prodigious a Lady, from the de&s;arts of <HI>Boeotid</HI> to the Throne of <HI>Calcides?</HI> And whereas now you lye buried an unprofitable burden to the world in the Sepulcher of a Forre&s;t, you
<PB N="71" REF="44">would return to live in publick, to the glory of our age? What pretend ye to with &s;uch anxie|ty, for an extingui&s;h'd Beauty, that you &s;o much love her? Is it haply with hopes to re|vive her, that &s;he may again return to torment you? That's an enterprize wholly unworthy of your prudence; For <HI>Lucinda</HI> &s;hall never re|turn more to the earth. And although the Fa|bles of antiquity might be renewed, and &s;he &s;hould ri&s;e again, Do you pre&s;ume, peradventure, that &s;he with her nature changed, would ri&s;e fa|vourable and faithful? It would be a folly to im|magine it. For a per&s;on dead, therefore, which fir&s;t with betraying you for another per&s;on, and after with dying, hath thereby confe&s;&s;ed her &s;elf unworthy of you, would you ca&s;t away your &s;elf by leading a life, no better than a perpe|tuall death; depriving your illu&s;trious family, this Kingdom, and your &s;elf, of the glory of your prowe&s;&s;e, to the good of mankind? Such gifts of Heaven &s;o prodigally &s;howred down up|on your gentle per&s;on, ought the&s;e, I &s;ay, to be &s;o mi&s;erably abu&s;ed by a vain pa&s;&s;ion, to the unexpre&s;&s;ible detriment of your renowned blood, of the age, and of your &s;elf? Ah Sir, re-a&s;&s;ume at la&s;t, rea&s;&s;ume tho&s;e generous &s;pirits, which your birth in&s;tilled into your brea&s;t, and by your birth, Heaven; and if &s;o mi&s;erable a lo&s;&s;e of your high honours, hath been overpa&s;t by a weak inamoured youthfulne&s;&s;e; let the glori|ous reparation of a maturer age, dart out of the&s;e &s;haddows into the noble &s;erenitie of brave enterpri&s;es: For if in youth its a le&s;s &s;hame to err; more glorious al&s;o will the redre&s;&s;e of
<PB N="72" REF="45">tho&s;e errors appear, which would environ your temples with the crown of a mo&s;t noble princi|pality.

<P><HI>Arnaldo</HI> &s;eemed whil&s;t I was &s;peaking, by his deep &s;ighs, and by the admiration, expre&s;t in his face, partly to approve my &s;ayings; where|upon, when he &s;aw me &s;ilent, he added, Friend, In a &s;hort compa&s;&s;e you have compri&s;ed things very different, and worthy of greate&s;t con&s;ide|ration. In that part therefore which pertains to the invalidity of my griefs for an exanimate and faithle&s;&s;e beauty, the cau&s;e of &s;o many mi&s;eries to me; I &s;hould ea&s;ily be brought to acknowledg my &s;implicity occa&s;ioned by a fal&s;e opinion fix|ed in my head by youthfull Vanity, and a me|lancholly con&s;titution that took root in my birth, and is now almo&s;t converted into Nature, by the infelicity of my tragicall adventures. But of the novelties &s;ucceeded in the Principa|lity of <HI>Negroponte,</HI> of the exile and death of <HI>Periander,</HI> and his &s;i&s;ter, and of the right of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> to that Crown, as al&s;o of the pre|ten&s;ion I might nouri&s;h towards her per&s;on, it's not nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould di&s;cour&s;e with &s;uch confu&s;ion, and ha&s;te; but rather let us find out a time and place to inform our &s;elves of nece&s;&s;a|ry
<PB N="73" REF="45">contingences: For though we &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e that I did propound, and that <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> &s;hould not reject this match; yet it would be good to know, if the Dutche&s;&s;e would con&s;ent, that a Lady, who is not known &s;o much as to be in the World, &s;hould &s;ucceed her in the Prin|cipality. And, were we certain &s;he would ac|knowledge her, and con&s;ent that &s;he &s;ucceed her, yet is it a que&s;tion whether &s;he would per|mit her to match her &s;elf into the hou&s;e of a &s;trange Knight; which may pretend by right of blood, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom of <HI>Thebes.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Arnaldo</HI> held his peace, and I replied: Sir, <HI>He who too critically di&s;tingui&s;heth in grand enterprizes, doth fru&s;trate them before they be half effected.</HI> It's good therefore that prudence take place, but yet it's nece&s;&s;ary to leave &s;omething to the arbitrament of Fortune.</P>
<P><HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> already holds by birth a right to a&s;pire, after the Dutche&s;&s;e, to the Crown of <HI>Cal|cides,</HI> nor can all the violence in the World de|prive her of this right of nature. She liveth not at pre&s;ent at the Dutche&s;&s;e's di&s;po&s;all, which as yet doth not know in what part of the world &s;he is conceal'd; or rather hath forgot all thoughts of her per&s;on, as if &s;he had never been born. Let us &s;ay nothing to the young Lady of this &s;e|cret, and let us onely with the help of <HI>Olympia,</HI> drive on your marriage with her; for, this done, we &s;hall have time enough afterwards, of di&s;|clo&s;ing &s;o grand a &s;ecret, and of imparting the truth to the Dutche&s;&s;e; who when &s;he &s;hall hear that &s;he is already e&s;pou&s;ed to a Cavalier &s;o
<PB N="74" REF="46">well accompli&s;hed, will have no occa&s;ion for which to repute her unworthy of Succe&s;|&s;ion to the Principality, through the &s;u&s;pitions which their flight might beget in the minds of the people, as if that, for actions unworthy of her, &s;he had fled from <HI>Negropont.</HI> Then, as to the right of birth which you al&s;o pretend to the Crown of <HI>Thebes;</HI> the intere&s;ts of State will de|clare in your favour: giving you a ground to hope one day by means of this match, if not in your per&s;on, in that of your de&s;cendents, to unite all the&s;e Provinces under one onely Crown; For although, by rea&s;on the Kingdom of <HI>Thebes</HI> is far greater than the Dukdom of <HI>Ne|gropont,</HI> there might &s;ome ob&s;tacle ari&s;e from the fear of becoming of a Soveraign State, a &s;ub&s;i|dinate Province, there would not want oppor|tune means to adju&s;t &s;uch differences by a&s;&s;u|ring the <HI>Calcidonians</HI> that they &s;hould never be commanded by <HI>Theban</HI> Mini&s;ters as &s;ubjects, but &s;hould be alwayes governed as a free State, by per&s;ons of the Royall Family. But &s;uch like con&s;iderations are at pre&s;ent un&s;ea&s;onable; and it &s;hall &s;uffice to know, that there never want eva&s;ions and pretexts for Soveraigns, where|with they may &s;atisfie the preten&s;ions of the people. The point on which your prudence ought to in&s;i&s;t, is, to rou&s;e your &s;elf out of this unprofitable ob&s;curity; and to procure the al|liance of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> before that the news from <HI>Calcides</HI> of her family do arive to her notice.

<PB N="75" REF="46">that advi&s;eth to any enterprize, &s;hould know, above all things, how to inve&s;tigate the means requi&s;ite to execute it.</P>
<P>If you think a Marriage with <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> to be a good act in me; I will confe&s;&s;e that &s;he al|ready is po&s;&s;e&s;t with &s;ome inclinations in fa|vour of my per&s;on; and that <HI>Olympia</HI> being my Mother's &s;i&s;ter, may promi&s;e us all good &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e. To you I refer my &s;elf, and becau&s;e we are ju&s;t at the bounds of my Fore&s;t, and upon the pa&s;&s;ing into that of <HI>Olympia,</HI> I will return to my hou&s;e, and you may, as Conductor of my people, who cary <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> her prey, intro|duce your &s;elf into the acquaintance of that La|dy. That will &s;uffice, and this will &s;erve you for a Token of &s;ecurity with <HI>Olympia,</HI> that you treat with her by my con&s;ent about &s;uch a pro|po&s;ition: And &s;o &s;aying, he took a Diamond from his finger, and put it upon mine.</P>
<P>I received it, and taking my leave of the Knight, forded the Brook, with the conduct of four &s;ervants, which carried to <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> upon a rurall Barrow of &s;ticks, the Stagg that &s;he had &s;lain.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had &s;et foot upon the champain, I thought that the liberty of the open air did re|pleni&s;h my &s;oul with unu&s;uall re&s;entments of joy, in &s;uch manner, that they wholly removed the remembrances of all pa&s;t dy&s;a&s;ters, fixing me onely in the thoughts of my pre&s;ent occa&s;i|ons, giving me a certain proof of the bounty of Heaven, being &s;o far &s;eparated from my Native Country; in that, though my heart was not, yet at lea&s;t my fortune was changed by the alte|tation of the Climate.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="47">
<P>I came by Sun-&s;et to the hou&s;e of <HI>Olympia,</HI> a proud Structure, which would better have enno|bled a great City, than &s;uch a &s;alvage habitation; I found her buried in an aby&s;&s;e of grief and tears, for the wanting, the joy of her eyes, the fair <HI>Argo&s;thenia;</HI> which lo&s;ing her way (as was &s;uppo&s;ed) after the cha&s;e of that Stagg, which we brought life-le&s;&s;e to her hou&s;e, was no more &s;een of all that day. Whereupon di&s;patching all her people in &s;earch of her, &s;he &s;ate alone with her women to condole the &s;u&s;pition of &s;ome un|expected dy&s;a&s;ter. I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;pectacle, that I lo&s;t in the very enterance of my de&s;ign the thread, by which I was to weave the webb, recommended me by the <HI>Injur'd Lover;</HI> for that was the name, which out of tho&s;e woods was born by <HI>Arnaldo.</HI> Yet I com|plemented with the Lady in terms befitting her nobility and my duty, endeavouring to comfort her, but in vain: for night had already enrob'd it's &s;elf in gloomy &s;hades, and her dome&s;ticks were returned from the que&s;t of the Lady, with|out any news of her per&s;on, which precipitated her into &s;uch grief, and drew from her &s;o great lamentation, that it would have moved to pitty the in&s;en&s;ible hardne&s;&s;e of &s;tones. Whereupon, being grown de&s;perate at this incounter, be|cau&s;e the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on permitted me to travel in the night, the &s;ervants of <HI>Arnaldo</HI> being di&s;|mi&s;t, I di&s;po&s;ed my &s;elf never to return thither without having fir&s;t learnt &s;ome tidings of the lo&s;t Lady. I had ob&s;erved in my walke with the Knight, the hollowings of barbarous voyces in certain parts of the Forre&s;t; but, tran&s;ported by
<PB N="77" REF="47">the current of our di&s;cour&s;e, I took no great notice of it for that time; &s;eeing that none of the Cavaliers followers were in the lea&s;t moved at it, or expre&s;t the lea&s;t alteration: So it came in|to my thought to re-pa&s;&s;e thither. And though I wanted the clue of <HI>Ariadne</HI> to guide me, in the night, through the Labyrinth of &s;uch thickets: yet I made u&s;e of &s;ome ob&s;ervations I had made in &s;ome groves of <HI>Italy,</HI> to know the tracks of men and bea&s;ts, and I re&s;olved pre|&s;ently to depart. But I had &s;carce &s;et foot in the Forre&s;t, when me-thought I heard the mur|mure of pa&s;&s;engers; whence, not certain whe|ther they might be men or bea&s;ts, I layd hold of my &s;word, and &s;ecuring my head with my Helmet, I withdrew my &s;elf behind the root of a va&s;t Oak, encompa&s;&s;ed by a little thicket of young Oakes, newly grown, to ob&s;erve the pa&s;|&s;ages of this encounter; it being a piece of fol|ly, rather than valour, to run into perills and dangers, without any rea&s;on or nece&s;&s;ity. And &s;carce was I provided with that &s;anctuary of &s;e|curity, when I perceived, more by the &s;ound of the ear, than by the di&s;cernment of the eye, that they were men that pa&s;&s;ed that way, and I fancied to hear one of them &s;ay: We have made a good booty, but it will be nece&s;&s;ary we get out of the&s;e <HI>Purly's</HI> before day, otherwi&s;e we run a hazard of being di&s;covered. Hearing this, I began pre&s;ently to imagine, that this prey was no other than <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> Hereupon letting them &s;carce pa&s;&s;e &s;o far as not to di&s;cover me, I put my &s;elf into the path they took, to follow them.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="48">
<P>But &s;carce had I gone three hundred paces, when they &s;topt at the mouth of a Grott, where they endeavoured to take away &s;ome impedi|ments of loggs and &s;tones, which barracado'd it; the which while they were intent to do, one of them felt him&s;elf wounded with &s;o &s;ound a blow, that crying he was &s;lain, he fell goaning to the earth. And whil&s;t another of the knot would require of him, What was the matter, I &s;aw him al&s;o ran through the bre&s;t with a boar|&s;pear, and tumbled clo&s;e by the other. There re|mained two others, the which &s;tept back, and drew their &s;words, putting them&s;elves upon their defence, asking, What Devill was de&s;cended down there, in the little &s;pace they had been gone? Then <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> skipt out of that Cave with a &s;pear in her hand, exclaiming: Ah Traitors! It's the Ju&s;tice of Heaven that &s;mites you. Now I have untyed tho&s;e hands your villany bound. And that &s;aying, made at them, and hurt one of them in the face: and after that, leaping over tho&s;e ob&s;tacles of blocks and &s;tones, betook her &s;elf to flight, through tho&s;e tracks, wherewith &s;he was very well ac|quainted; The two A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inats &s;eeing that, ran after her to &s;tay her: hereupon, &s;eeing that now was the time to di&s;cover my &s;elf in relief of that Lady; I pur&s;ued them, reproaching them with that barbari&s;m. <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> heard me before the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates, and, animated by that unexpected &s;uccour, &s;he turned head again&s;t them with admirable undauntedne&s;s; &s;o that the two ruf|fians being engaged betwixt the Ladie's &s;pear and my &s;word, they could not e&s;cape their de&s;er|ved
<PB N="79" REF="48">deaths. Howbeit they did not dye unre|venged; for I received a blow upon the fore|head, upon the border of my murrion, and a deep &s;tabb in the left arm, and hand. <HI>Argo&s;the|nia</HI> in like manner, had a rever&s;e &s;o great upon the head, that if it had fallen edgewi&s;e, as it did flat, all the hope of <HI>Arnaldo</HI> had faln to the earth, with that blow. Yet did &s;he fall in a &s;wound; whereupon, I not knowing in &s;o great a de&s;titution of all things, with what other ar|gument to provide for her, whi&s;pered &s;ome charms &s;oftly to her, and made her come to her &s;elf; but &s;o ill &s;he was, that &s;he had no appre|hen&s;ion of her &s;elf. Yet in the end re-a&s;&s;uming her proper knowledge, &s;he reque&s;ted me to tell her, Who I was: and having told her, &s;he ex|pre&s;t an inconceivable &s;atisfaction, and cour|teou&s;ly pre&s;enting me her hand, aro&s;e from the ground, &s;aying; Let us walk Sir, for I be|ing very well accu&s;tomed in the wayes, will bring you in le&s;&s;e than an hour to the hou&s;e of <HI>Arnaldo;</HI> for to that of <HI>Olympia</HI> I will return by my &s;elf as &s;oon as day breaks. No, Madam, an|&s;wered I, It is convenient that we go fir&s;t to that of <HI>Olympia,</HI> for &s;he is &s;ubmerged in an ocean of perplexities for fear of you. After you have obliged me for my life, you would al|&s;o overcome me in Civility, an&s;wered the Lady. But that you &s;hall not do; for you had need to have your wounds dre&s;t, if you well ob&s;erve your left arm, and I feel nothing but a &s;light blow on the head, which amounts to nothing; &s;o that it's requi&s;ite, that we go to the neere&s;t hou&s;e. And be&s;ide, I would not that the fami|ly
<PB N="80" REF="49">of <HI>Olympia</HI> &s;hould &s;ee you with me, whil&s;t the aire of your face, and the fa&s;hion of your de|portment fal&s;ifie the mode&s;ty, which otherwi&s;e I &s;ee in your countenance, &amp; ob&s;erve in your man|ners. I then interrupted her: The&s;e con&s;iderations are of no effect, now that I am ju&s;t come from the hou&s;e of <HI>Olympia</HI> to &s;eek you, and mu&s;t treat with her about &s;ome affairs, which I hope will &s;ucceed to your &s;atisfaction al&s;o. Here the La|dy leaping with a &s;udden alacrity, &s;aid; And what is it? Perhaps you bring me &s;ome news from <HI>Negroponte?</HI> Is it happily that the Tyrant my brother is dead? I would have you, Madam, retain more comfortable thoughts, an&s;wered I; Be to your brother what will, you &s;hall not want a fortune, if you know how to entertain it.</P>
<P>Calamities I conceive I may expect (replied the young Lady) in this my mi&s;erable life, onely made tolerable by my Genius, which will not give place in any re&s;pect to fortune, and as the mi&s;adventure even now hapned to me may give &s;ome proof: but of fortunate adventures I nei|ther apprehend them, nor do I hope for them. And how then (&s;aid I) came you into this danger? I know not very well (&s;aid the youthfull Lady) how to relate it, yet I &s;hall acquaint you in brief, with that which befell me: and (by the way I mu&s;t tell you) I have ever ob&s;erved hither|to, that I am mo&s;t merry when I am acco&s;ted with &s;ome unexpected dy&s;a&s;ter. Departing therefore from your Company &s;omewhat joyed, for having found the Cavalier <HI>Arnaldo</HI> in a manner of car|riage and looks, unu&s;ual to his lugubrious me|lancholy,
<PB N="81" REF="49">I forgat my way: but I had not gone above a thou&s;and paces, when I &s;aw the&s;e villains &s;tart out of certain craggy places; and before I perceived my &s;elf a&s;&s;aulted, I found I was bound, and carried to the Grot, whence I am now e&s;cap't. Which, having &s;erved heretofore either for an habitation of people, or for &s;ome reli|gious Rites, within is very commodious, and ca|pacious enough for eight or ten per&s;ons. Here, I had, ju&s;t before I came to you, left this my Hunting &s;pear, and one of my upper Garments, recommending them to a &s;hepheard which ac|companied me, to run the fa&s;ter with my Bow after the Stag, which I &s;lew at your feet. Here al&s;o the&s;e men tied me fa&s;ter then before, that I might not make u&s;e of my hands, blocking me up in &s;uch a manner as you might have ea&s;ily ob|&s;erved, getting together a great number of logs and &s;tones, to fill up the mouth of the cave. With what intention they did this, they would not tell me. Onely I collected, that they would expect the night to take me hence unob&s;erved, and carry me to <HI>Thebes;</HI> for as much as I &s;u&s;pe|cted this Crime of Trea&s;on was de&s;cended from <HI>Diambres,</HI> a principal Cavalier among the <HI>Thebane</HI> Nobility; who having long &s;erved and &s;olici|ted me in vain, &s;eeing the ugline&s;&s;e of his face and the rudene&s;&s;e of his di&s;po&s;ition could not di&s;po&s;e me to affect him; he would have ravi&s;hed me, to obtain that from me with violence, which he could never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e him&s;elf of, by Love.</P>
<P>Seeing my &s;elf therefore included in this Ca|vern, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> the wi&s;e School-Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e of our &s;afety, taught me the manner how to break my
<PB N="82" REF="50">bonds; for I drew neer the edge and points of &s;ome &s;tones, and I endeavoured in &s;uch &s;ort to fret the cords and &s;trings (that bound my arms to my &s;ides) again&s;t them, that &s;o getting the&s;e loo&s;e fir&s;t, I might break al&s;o tho&s;e that tied together my hands. Seeing my &s;elf at liberty, and with my &s;pear, I skipt with &s;uch joy, that I thought every minute a thou&s;and years, that the Ruffians delayed to clear the enterance of the Grotto, which work I often attempted my &s;elf, but I found it altogether impo&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of the too great bulk, and heavine&s;&s;e of that Barricado of Trees and Stones accumulated by the &s;trength of four men, which a weak woman was not able to remove. Now, prai&s;ed be the Heavens, that by their benignity and your &s;uccour, I am again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my liberty, for I would certainly far rather die a thou&s;and times, than &s;ee my &s;elf in the power of the deformed <HI>Diambres,</HI> whom I hate more then death. I would not for that time multiply Complements to a&s;cribe her liberty to her own valour, more than my &s;low &s;uccour; but &s;eeing her pau&s;e at the&s;e words: But Madam, &s;aid I, all are not <HI>Diamrbes</HI>'s, &s;o that you &s;hould de&s;ite to live always &s;ingle. And even this peril which you have ju&s;t now run through, ought to adverti&s;e you to provide for the &s;ecu|rity of your per&s;on; (which being &s;o beautifull will be ever obnoxious to treacheries) by chu|&s;ing a husband worthy of you. Here the &s;pright|full La&s;&s;e with an incon&s;iderate ge&s;ture of pure freedom, void of all deceit, &s;aid; Sir Knight, if you peradventure be he, which by believing to have obliged me, &s;hall de&s;ire me for your wife;
<PB N="83" REF="50">content your &s;elf, that I tell you, that I &s;hall ever confe&s;&s;e my obligation; nor do your qua|lities a jot di&s;plea&s;e me: but having already de|dicated my Soul to another, it is not conve|nient I be&s;tow on you this mi&s;erable part of my &s;elf, which though fair that it is, may by a light indi&s;po&s;ition be &s;oon deformed, and chang'd in|to ugline&s;&s;e. Hereupon I rejoyced exceeding|ly at the &s;o ingenuous freedom of the Lady, and added; Madam, I a&s;&s;ure you, I have not &s;poke for my &s;elf &s;o much, becau&s;e my de&s;tiny hath already bound me in other Chains, as becau&s;e I am con&s;cious of my incapacity of &s;uch a favour, exceeding the &s;lenderne&s;&s;e of my fortune; but I have &s;poke to other ends more worthy of the Nobility of your birth, and the genero&s;ity of your &s;pirit. You wrong your &s;elf &s;aid the Lady, and withall offend my mode&s;ty; for had I my Soul at liberty, and you &s;hould then nouri&s;h &s;uch preten&s;ions, I would not a jot re&s;pect Fortune, but would con&s;ider your accompli&s;hments, and my obligements: for other then your &s;elf, I am &s;ure you treat not for; being a Stranger, newly ar|rived in this Countrey, &amp; having never known me before to day, I am confident you &s;peak for none but your &s;elf. Let us turn our di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ome other matter, and content your &s;elf, that there pa&s;&s;e between us onely a bare corre&s;pondence of &s;incere friend&s;hip, and pure endearments.</P>
<P>You honour me too much, gentle Madam, &s;aid I! And in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time, as I have known you; I am pre&s;ented with an occa&s;ion to intreat your favour in behalf of another. And what is he, &s;aid <HI>Argo&s;thenia?</HI> One that perhaps
<PB N="84" REF="51">will not di&s;plea&s;e you, added I. But I would fir&s;t treat with <HI>Olympia.</HI> The Lady &s;igh'd, and &s;aid, <HI>Olympia</HI> is my Lady, but I am Lady of my &s;elf in this particular. Therefore tell me what you are to &s;ay to <HI>Olympia;</HI> for be&s;ides that your &s;uit concerns none but my &s;elf, I pretend no|thing from <HI>Olympia,</HI> and may pretend much from my own family. I added, The Knight my Ho&s;t is he that de&s;ires you for your &s;elf, and that will &s;hew you the rea&s;on al&s;o of that which he ex|pects from you. The young Lady &s;igh'd, and gave a &s;udden &s;tart, &s;aying to me, <HI>Arnaldo?</HI> Yes, Ma|dam, &s;aid I: At my per&s;wa&s;ion he de&s;ires you to &s;ucceed with a more propitious fortune in the place of his ingratefull <HI>Lucinda.</HI> So then, &s;ub|joyned <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> I am doubly obliged; in my life, and in my contentment: without having done any thing to oblige you to &s;o generous, and endearing favours. It's the duty of all high|born Souls (&s;aid I) to procure the benefit of an|other, e&s;pecially of Ladies of your quality. When you plea&s;e therefore <HI>Arnaldo</HI> &s;hall be your husband, and I a &s;ervant to you both: Bro|ther rather, &s;aid <HI>Argo&s;thenia;</HI> for to a Gentleman of &s;o noble, and generous qualities, a title &s;o ignoble &amp; vile as that of &s;ervant doth not agree. But how may I believe you (excu&s;e my indi&s;cre|tion being tran&s;ported beyond my &s;elf) that <HI>Ar|naldo</HI> commi&s;&s;ionated you to &s;uch a treaty? I &s;ud|denly replied, Behold here, Madam, this Ring (and pre&s;ented it to her) which you have often &s;een on his finger, and this he pre&s;ents you as the pledge of his pa&s;&s;ion. The Lady took it with a &s;mile, &s;aying; Now my obligements to you are
<PB N="85" REF="51">&s;o incomparable, that I want a conceit to appre|hend them, and language to thank you for them. Tell <HI>Arnaldo</HI> that <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> was born either to be enjoyed by <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> or el&s;e onely by death. Choo&s;e he what he plea&s;eth, for I am content, whether it be with him, or with it.</P>
<P>You &s;hall do me the favour to carry back to him this Collanet (and pulled it from her neck) with my Picture, that he may keep it &s;o much the neerer his heart, as he is the heart of my brea&s;t, the &s;pirit of my Soul. Then, in giving it to me, &s;he &s;tayd her hand on mine, adding, Sir, <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI> cannot give you a greater proof of the obligations &s;he profe&s;&s;eth to owe you.</P>
<P>I then ki&s;t that hand of this courteous and ingenious Creature, acknowledging &s;uch ho|nours to be infinite favours: a&s;&s;uring her, to the utmo&s;t of &s;o incon&s;iderable a fortune and ability, a perpetuall ob&s;ervance and fidelity to her per&s;on, and to the Knight her Spou&s;e.</P>
<P>Whether it was the ob&s;curity of the night, (become greater by a little mi&s;ling &s;hower which began to bedew the tracks of the Forre&s;t); or el&s;e the apprehen&s;ion of the things we di&s;cour&s;|ed of I know not, but &s;o it happened, that <HI>Ar|go&s;thenia</HI> led us out of the way, nor did &s;he perceive it, till that being tired by the walk, &s;he took notice &s;he was nigh to the murmure of a Brook, which begirt the Forre&s;t about; whereat being &s;urpriz'd with a chilne&s;&s;e &s;he &s;aid, Sir, by my carele&s;ne&s;&s;e, we are &s;o wandered out of our way, that we are above &s;even miles from the hou&s;e of <HI>Olympia,</HI> and four from that of <HI>Ar|naldo.</HI> To return at this hour, and from this
<PB N="86" REF="52">place, into the Forre&s;t would be an expo&s;ing our &s;elves to a manife&s;t peril of our lives, being we mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e through &s;ome great Valleys inhabited onely by Wolves; and if we would cro&s;&s;e the Brook, and walk towards the hou&s;e of <HI>Olympia,</HI> we mu&s;t al&s;o wander three miles in the Forre&s;t along the Banks of this River, before we can find a place to ford it; it being very large as you &s;ee, and full of quick Sands and Rocks in the&s;e parts. Pardon me, I intreat you, this errour commit|ted ca&s;ually again&s;t my will; and do me the fa|vour to lend me &s;omething to cover my head, that the rain may not ulcerate my wound, which I find to be already much &s;welled. Hearing her &s;ay &s;o, I pulled from under my Coat a large Taf|faty Scarf, and pre&s;ented her with it, and al&s;o a Handkerchief, expre&s;&s;ing my grief not to be &s;o much at the mi&s;&s;ing of the way, as at the pains which thereby &s;he was put to. Upon which the Lady replied: Yet cannot I do any thing to &s;hew the &s;en&s;e your obligements impre&s;&s;e in me; though I would willingly dedicate the better half of my dayes to return part of that acknow|ledgement, which the Laws of gratitude doth with ju&s;tice exact for &s;o &s;upream a favour, and &s;o high a content, as your pre&s;ence hath po&s;&s;e&s;t me of. But that which adds to my grief, is, that you, having need of repo&s;e, and remedy to your wounds, do by this foggy aire of the night exa&s;perate them afre&s;h.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was talking thus, and her hands were imployed about the binding up and co|vering her head, her foot &s;lid by rea&s;on of the &s;lipperine&s;&s;e of the ground, occa&s;ioned through
<PB N="87" REF="52">the exce&s;&s;ive rain that had faln, and &s;o &s;he tumb|led into a deep pla&s;h of water, made by the ri|&s;ing of the Current in that part. It was the goodne&s;&s;e of Heaven that &s;he &s;hould fall di|rectly upon her feet, otherwi&s;e &s;he had ran the danger of brui&s;ing her &s;elf, on certain &s;plin|ters of the &s;tump of a tree, cut down upon the bank of that river. And it was al&s;o a happy turn, that the charity of the neighbouring &s;tream did reflect &s;ome little duski&s;h light in the aire, that I might thereby find out the way to recover her from that precipice: The which I finally did, though with great difficulty; for &s;he through the fright of the fall was &s;o bereft of force, that &s;he was altogether unable to walk. Being forced therefore by nece&s;sity, as if &s;he had been a little Child, I took her in my arms; and &s;he, weeping with tenderne&s;&s;e, for her fa&s;ter-&s;itting put her left arm about my neck, &s;aying to me; Sir, Nece&s;sity violates all Laws. I am in your arms, but I am <HI>Arnaldo</HI>'s &s;pou&s;e; Let it plea&s;e you therefore that this imbracement be of a &s;i&s;ter to her brother, to whom &s;he confe&s;&s;es to owe her life a thou&s;and times. I being moved with pity, and the gene|ro&s;ity together of the young Lady, was almo&s;t ready to weep, replying; I know very well Ma|dam what a Gentleman's duty is towards a Lady of your merit; and to a friend, of the quality of <HI>Arnaldo.</HI> Make the &s;ame accompt of me, as if I were truely that which you plea&s;e to term me, your brother; &s;ince age con&s;ents not that I call you daughter. So I will, I a&s;|&s;&s;ure you an&s;wered &s;he; and re&s;ting for feeble|ne&s;&s;e one cheek upon my head, made me think
<PB N="88" REF="53">her &s;o light, that I &s;carce felt the weight of her body.</P>
<P>Walking in this manner, about half a mile, my ear was alarm'd with a &s;low murmur of humane voices; whereupon hearkning towards that part I perceived they were fi&s;her-men, which ca&s;ting baits to the fi&s;hes &s;tood &s;ilently expecting, that they would run to the &s;ame to &s;wallow them. Making therefore to the brink of the Brook, I called them to waft me over to the Champain. They, like rude and &s;imple people, very unwil|lingly con&s;ented to it, as loath to deprive them|&s;elves of the &s;orry prey which they expected in their Nets. Whereupon perceiving this their wretched avidity, I invited them by a promi&s;e of rewarding them with a benefit more worth then a hundred &s;uch fi&s;h. They hearing that, turned their Boat to the place where we were, &amp; to our misfortune landed us on the other &s;ide. To our misfortune, I &s;ay: for having with the dawn of the new-born day di&s;covered at a little di&s;tance from us, the Towers of a Ca&s;tle founded upon a little Hill, ju&s;t when that <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> ha|ving received part of her &s;trength, might be able to walk, we directed our &s;teps towards that place with hope to find harbour and relief; I for my wounds, <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> for her weakne&s;&s;e. But &s;carce had we begun to mount the ri&s;e of the Hill, when on the in&s;tant there came towards us out of the Gate of the Ca&s;tle, a tumultuous Troop of per&s;ons, &s;ome on Hor&s;e-back, and &s;ome on foot: among which <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> having di&s;co|vered <HI>Diambres,</HI> with a look betwixt furious and di&s;dainfull, &s;he betook her&s;elf to frightfull and
<PB N="89" REF="53">trembling &s;hrieks. Ah! Sir Knight, &s;aid &s;he to me, We are lo&s;t. And why, &s;aid I? <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> would have an&s;wered, but what through fear, &amp; what through anger, &s;he could not pronounce a word. The behaviour of the Dam&s;el put the people into a &s;u&s;pition, &s;o that they de&s;cended towards us: but on the other &s;ide &s;he was, by watching, and by travail, and by the things that bound her head &s;o transformed, that it would have been no ea&s;ie matter to know her. By this time &s;he knew this to be the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Diambres,</HI> which removing thither to effect her rape, had ju&s;t at that in&s;tant received advice of her taking, and of her flight (with the death of his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins) by a Wood-man, which pa&s;sing through the Forre&s;t at midnight, to provide &s;ome Wood for his occa&s;ions, had found one of them, yet-half-living upon the ground. He &s;uddenly hereupon took hor&s;e with his people, intending to pa&s;&s;e over into the Forre&s;t, and cau&s;e the dead bodies to be buried, that his attempt might not come to light: &s;ince the fact being committed in the Territories of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> a Knight of the bloud Royal (be&s;ides his fear of that Cavalier, which would defend his right with Arms) he might thereupon come to be accu&s;ed as guilty of High-Trea&s;on in the bloud of the Prince&s;&s;e. Di&s;covering me therefore, together with her; he pre&s;ently imagined the truth, for we being fled we knew not whither, were taken in the Net we &s;ought to avoid. Hereupon he commanded his &s;ervants &s;uddenly to &s;urround us and take us; I &s;eeing the enterpri&s;ing of an e&s;cape to be de|&s;perate, being alone, wounded, and unprovided
<PB N="90" REF="54">again&s;t a hundred per&s;ons, and being unwilling to for&s;ake the young Lady: onely &s;aid to her, that &s;he &s;hould not fear, but di&s;&s;emble that &s;he knew any thing that he had been the contriver of her ravi&s;hment; and meet the misfortunes of that impri&s;onment with a &s;miling face. <HI>Diambres</HI> knowing the Lady though thus di&s;gui&s;ed, was tran&s;ported with an inconceivable joy; com|manding his Steward to execute what was to be done in the Forre&s;t: and he returned him&s;elf into the Ca&s;tle, and cau&s;ed us both to be put in Chambers apart, but yet neer to one another, co|ming fir&s;t to examine me to know who I was, and whence I came, and what intere&s;t I had in <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> I replied with an unmoved coun|tenance, telling him the truth of my condition, and as to the Lady, I &s;aid, I held no other rela|tion to her per&s;on then what the duty of a Knight exacted of &s;uccouring her, finding her pur&s;ued by two a&s;&s;a&s;sins to abu&s;e her, as I pa&s;t through the neighbouring Forre&s;t towards <HI>The|bes. Diambres</HI> re&s;ted &s;atisfied with my freedom, nor would he take notice of the villains, for fear of di&s;covering him&s;elf, but left me with a doubt|full brow, going to <HI>Argo&s;thenia;</HI> whereupon per|ceiving already that there was but a Wall be|tween us, I &s;et my eyes and ears on work, to find out &s;ome crevice, whereat to hear that which pa&s;t about <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> And fortune was plea&s;ed &s;o &s;uccesfully to a&s;si&s;t me, that I found under the Tape&s;try that the Wall was cleft, for that there had been a door which was now made up: I be|gan with a Rowel of a Spur to &s;crat away the Lime, to make a hole. Which done, I found that
<PB N="91" REF="54">the carele&s;ne&s;&s;e of the work-men in &s;topping up that door, had thrown in &s;ome bits of &s;tones, and rubbi&s;h, covering them over with onely one layer of bricks. I was at this tran&s;ported with joy, and &s;eemed to leap into Heaven, promi&s;ing my &s;elf now a corre&s;pondency with the young Lady, and to ob&s;erve all the proceedings of <HI>Diambres.</HI> Yet notwith&s;tanding, I could not for that time, with|out making my &s;elf heard, learn the lea&s;t intelli|gence of his treaty with her; but in the &s;ilence of the en&s;uing night, I opened a breach by the remove of 2 &s;tones among&s;t the re&s;t of that rub|bi&s;h, and called <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> to me; who told me very good news, that <HI>Diambres,</HI> though other|wi&s;e rude and be&s;tial, being civilized and in&s;tru|cted by Love, and, as he &s;aid, by my Mode&s;ty and Genero&s;ity, had behaved him&s;elf in very civil manner towards her, hoping to reduce her by courte&s;ie to admit him for her husband. Yet he had conceived a great jealou&s;ie of me, for having ob&s;erved on her finger the Ring of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> he feared that there had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome kind of con|tract between us. I comforted, and coun&s;elled the Lady according to that, which I judged op|portune to her pre&s;ent condition, and &s;o left her with a mind, full of tranquillity, to take her repo&s;e, for who&s;e con&s;ideration more than for any other rea&s;on, I then became exceeding pen|&s;ive.</P>

<P>THe morning en&s;uing my departure, news ar|rived to the ear of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> that <HI>Argo&s;the|nia</HI> was lo&s;t, and that the Cavalier his Gue&s;t could not be found in any place, whereupon he di&s;patcht all his &s;ervants to &s;eek for them through all the Forre&s;t. Who having in vain all that day traver&s;ed tho&s;e Labyrinths, could learn no other tidings of them, than that they had found upon the place where fell out the bloudy Conflict, the Mantle and Bow of the Lady, the earth &s;tained with bloud, and the gra&s;&s;e &s;o tram|pled round about the place, that it was an ea&s;ie matter to &s;u&s;pect, there had hapned &s;ome hot en|counter of per&s;ons that had &s;harply contended for her &s;ake. The Knight was at this relation &s;ei&s;ed with a &s;trange &s;hivering; and though the night began to approach, he took with him his Arms, and four men appointed in Garbs be|tween courtly and martial, to go him&s;elf out of the Forre&s;t to trace out farther intelligence of tho&s;e things, which were reported to him by his dome&s;ticks.</P>
<P>Getting therefore out of the Forre&s;t at the time when night began, taking advantage by the Sun's ab&s;ence to u&s;urp upon the dayes &s;erenity, he came to under&s;tand upon pa&s;&s;ing the River, that which the Fi&s;her-men had related to divers
<PB N="93" REF="55">per&s;ons, how that they had about break of day, ferryed over to the other &s;hore, a &s;trange Gentleman with a young Lady in his arms. He hereupon went in per&s;on to that place, and finding the fi&s;hermen, he &s;trictly examined them, demanding of them the marks of the per|&s;ons: And perceived they could be no other then <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> and <HI>Philiterus.</HI> The Knight remained at this intelligence very &s;ad; nor did he know what to think of me; for <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> being in my arms, put &s;trange apprehen&s;ions of &s;u&s;pition in his head of &s;ome default, whereas in all rea&s;on, it was mo&s;t probable, that either I was retired with her to the hou&s;e of <HI>Olympia,</HI> or gone away from him without her. On the other &s;ide, under&s;tanding that we were both wounded, he comforted him&s;elf, how that yet we could not be very far off.</P>
<P>Next being informed, that we were gone towards the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Diambres,</HI> and that many of the people of the place were that day &s;een to go into the Forre&s;t, fording and refording of the Brook; he imagined the very truth touch|ing that Knight. And re&s;olving in his mind to be revenged, he went about midnight towards the Ca&s;tle, to ob&s;erve the actions of th'inhabi|tants, and gather &s;omething whereby to &s;atisfy his &s;u&s;pition. The Pallace of that Knight was founded above the wall of the Ca&s;tle, with four Towers, in one of which that did jet out over the Mote, that was but narrow and dry, <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI> and I were confined. But I, that in tho&s;e fini&s;ter incounters had pa&s;&s;ed two nights with|out &s;leep, was then buryed in a profound &s;lum|ber;
<PB N="94" REF="56">whereas <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> kept awake by her amarous cares, heard&s;ome little noy&s;e of hor&s;es and men, which &s;urrounded the out&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle-ditch. Thereupon, ravi&s;hed either by cu|rio&s;ity, or by the impetuo&s;ity of a Lover's Soul, which felt it &s;elf neer it's proper &s;eat; &s;he ran to the window, and though the night wanted the light of the Moon and mo&s;t of the Stars, as being overca&s;t with gloomy clouds; yet &s;he thought &s;he knew <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> by his mourning habit. But behold, ju&s;t as &s;he was ready to cry out, to let him know of her being there, <HI>Diambres</HI> entered into her Chamber, onely with one woman, which lighted him; whereupon, &s;he being called that way by the noi&s;e, and by the light, &s;he became the mo&s;t a&s;hamed Lady in the world: becau&s;e covered onely by a pure fine &s;mock, &s;he di&s;covered from head to foot the delicate proportions of her mo&s;t beautifull bo|dy. <HI>Diambres</HI> beholding, in that her confu&s;ion, the goodlie&s;t piece that ever Nature framed, he forgot his hone&s;t purpo&s;es, and already breathed with thoughts of the plea&s;ures of Love: where|upon demanding, not knowing what he &s;aid, What &s;he did at that hour at the window; &s;he ob&s;erving by the dejected ne&s;&s;e of his looks, and by the &s;ighs he &s;ent forth, his intentions, coura|giou&s;ly replyed, I looked on my husband, Where? &s;aid <HI>Diambres.</HI> Where he was, &s;aid <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> And, Who is he? added <HI>Diambres.</HI> One, &s;aid <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> that can make thee trem|ble from head to foot; and when he &s;hall know where I am, and the wrongs thou do&s;t me, he will make thee and this Ca&s;tle fly into the air as a &s;a|crifice
<PB N="95" REF="56">to his revenge. Is this thy husband that &s;leeps &s;o neer thee (&s;aid <HI>Diambres</HI> with a di&s;dain|full &s;mile) haply a Monarch of &s;ome va&s;t Em|pire? This is not my &s;pou&s;e, (&s;ubjoyned <HI>Ar|go&s;thenia</HI>) he is my brother by honour and for|tune. Shall <HI>Mars</HI> or <HI>Mercury</HI> then be thy hu&s;|band (replyed <HI>Diambres</HI>) that you &s;tand at this time of night looking on the Stars in Heaven? Be he who he will (&s;aid <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI>) know, that if you, forgetting the duty of a Knight, &s;hould u&s;e any violence to me, my &s;pou&s;e will revenge me of you, to the la&s;t drop of your blood. And therefore leave me in peace, for the&s;e are not hours &s;ea&s;onable to be in a maiden's chamber. <HI>Diambres</HI> knew not how to behave him&s;elf, now hurryed on by his lu&s;t, now re|tained by his duty; &s;o that for fear of &s;ome|times one thing, &s;ometimes another, he could not re&s;olve on any thing, believing that the La|dy &s;poke in that manner, not becau&s;e &s;he was really e&s;pou&s;ed, but in a womani&s;h flouri&s;h; and that if &s;o be &s;he were marryed, that fortune could befall none but me. Here his &s;en&s;uall ap|petite being overcome by the incounter of &s;uch beaut yes, he laid hands on the innocent Lady, whereupon &s;he, provoked by a rage full of real genero&s;ity, &s;uddenly &s;natcht the Candle&s;tick out of the womans hand, and flung it in the face of <HI>Diambres,</HI> with &s;uch a force, that it made him &s;tagger, and thus being freed from his hands &s;he flew out of the chamber, and ran wandering up and down the hou&s;e, till &s;he find|ing a hollow place under a &s;taire-ca&s;e, leapt in, and there conceal'd her &s;elf, to expect with the
<PB N="96" REF="57">day &s;ome opportunity of fortune, either to e&s;cape, or at lea&s;t to dye with a boldne&s;&s;e wor|thy of her birth and courage. But <HI>Diambres</HI> finding him&s;elf in &s;o ill a plight, and not da|ring for &s;hame to cry out, returned to his own chamber to have his wound &s;earched, giving or|ders, that without his expre&s;&s;e command none &s;hould open the gate of his Palace, or of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The morning following, there was a very ac|curate &s;earch made in every place, but <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI> could not be found: which &s;o di&s;plea&s;|ed <HI>Diambres,</HI> that bla&s;pheming, he threatened to reduce that hou&s;e to a&s;hes, to burn her in it, being mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly confident, that &s;he could not be gone from thence. The night being come, at the time when all were buryed in &s;ilence, <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> came forth of her concealment, returning upon her own accord to her pri&s;on, and &s;hutting her &s;elf in, &s;he came to call me. I having pa&s;t that day among a thou&s;and perplex|ed thoughts of her lo&s;&s;e, ran to hear her, and under&s;tood what had befaln her; but whil&s;t I &s;tood mu&s;ing of &s;ome plot, to &s;ave her from eminent ruine, and all in vain: She &s;aid to me, Sir, confiding in your faithfulne&s;&s;e; I will &s;in|cerely tell you what I think. If you &s;hall like it, well: if not, I am prepared to dye, as I have lived, nobly. I de&s;ire you would &s;tudy to open a hole &s;o big in this wall, that I may get through into your pri&s;on. The meat they bring you, will &s;uffice us both; and for your bed, I will content my &s;elf with a &s;mall corner at your feet. As for the re&s;t, I will a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf of
<PB N="97" REF="57">your ingenuity, that you will treate me as the &s;pou&s;e of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> and your &s;i&s;ter. In the mean time, who knows, but that <HI>Arnaldo</HI> may have &s;ome hint of our impri&s;onment. I having &s;een him la&s;t night to &s;urround this Ca&s;tle? Which if it be &s;o, re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that he will not be want|ing in his duty to his Spou&s;e, and to a Cavalier to whom he is &s;o much obliged. When I &s;aw there was no other way for her &s;afety, but this, I &s;ighing, &s;aid, She &s;hould be obeyed, putting my &s;elf al&s;o in perill of death for her &s;afty: for as to the pre&s;erving her &s;ecret and hone&s;t, I knew well enough what I was to do. This &s;aid, I &s;trove to break the wall without making a noi&s;e, which I ea&s;ily did: this done, and &s;he having on her &s;ide gathered all the rubbi&s;h of that breach, &s;he crept thorough into my cham|ber; where being entered and got upon her feet, &s;he threw her arms about my neck, and weeping, &s;aid, Dear Brother, If I &s;hould dye for you a thou&s;and times, I could not pay the thou&s;andth part of the obligements I owe you. I innocent|ly ki&s;t her forehead, intreating her to favour me with the continuance of the &s;ame exce&s;&s;ive con|fidence, for the regard of her own and my re|po&s;e. I already know, &s;aid &s;he, both who you are, and what I do: Speak no more of it; nor trouble me; for I know you would &s;ooner dye than fail in your fidelity to <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> or in your re&s;pects to <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> Here ending our di&s;|cour&s;e; we made up that breach in the wall the be&s;t we could, and tempering the lime in water, &s;o daubed up tho&s;e bricks on my part, that the fraud was very hard to be di&s;covered. Which
<PB N="98" REF="58">done becau&s;e the Lady was half dead with fa|mine, and I was &s;lightly &s;erved by rea&s;on of my wounds, &s;he was con&s;trained for that time to content her&s;elf with a few &s;lices of Cytron and a little water. By which being rea&s;onably re|fre&s;hed, &s;he lay down to &s;leep with a wonderfull Mode&s;ty and hone&s;ty on one &s;ide of the bed, and &s;eeing me about to re&s;t my &s;elf on the contrary part, &s;he would by no means permit me to do it, prote&s;ting to me, that if I did, &s;he would perpetually &s;tand upon her feer. Hereupon, not to contend with her, I al&s;o took a part of the bed; confining my &s;elf between the bounds of mode&s;ty and honour, not &s;o much as to look towards that fide which &s;he had made choice of for her repo&s;e.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t away eight dayes in this manner, with much felicity; for <HI>Diambres</HI> nece&s;&s;itated by his wound, not onely to keep him&s;elf reti|red but al&s;o free from the air there re&s;orted none to my chamber, but onely a Page at the hours of dinner and &s;upper, and a Chirurgion once a day. In which time, which I ordered to be very &s;hort, <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> lay hid in a che&s;t, or under the bed. Withall, I had &s;o wholly indeared the Page, a boy of fifteen years, of good extracti|on, of a facetious Genius, and great Soul, that he u&s;ed me with all the civility that I could de|&s;ire. He delighted above mea&s;ure to hear me relate the &s;ingularities of &s;trange places, and had an ardent de&s;ire to travel for &s;ome time into <HI>Italy;</HI> And becau&s;e I on the other &s;ide extolled, for merit, not for adulation, his Compo&s;ures in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, he could have been con|tent,
<PB N="99" REF="58">to have been continually talking with me. But I excu&s;ed my &s;elf by the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;t, to which I pretended my wounds obliged me, and I kept him, for <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI>'s con&s;ideration, at the greate&s;t di&s;tance I could. I omitted not neverthele&s;s for tho&s;e few moments, which he &s;taid with me, to ask him of the news of the place, and came to know, that (I could not tell how) news was carryed to <HI>Arnalod</HI>'s ear, that the Lady he &s;ought, could no-where be found, he not being able to learn the Tyranny of <HI>Diam|bres,</HI> and that he accu&s;ed me of her rape; and was gone to <HI>Athens;</HI> whither <HI>Diambres</HI> to co|ver his own villany had cau&s;ed it to be given out, that I was gone. This blow of injurious calumny, &s;triking at my faithfulne&s;&s;e, and the honour of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> transfixed my Soul with great anxiety; whereupon to clear my inno|cence, and comfort <HI>Arnaldo</HI> with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, I re&s;olved to be&s;tir my wit, to free me from that in ju&s;t and wretched capti|vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y. I began, in order thereunto, to under-feel the Page, if when <HI>Diambres</HI> &s;hould re&s;tore me to liberty, he would accept of my company to tran&s;port him&s;elf into <HI>Italy.</HI> I would it would plea&s;e Heaven, replyed he, I might be &s;o happy. And were it &s;o (&s;ubjoyn'd I) that <HI>Diambres</HI> for his own intere&s;ts, would not free me from this mi&s;ery, would you find in your heart to &s;ee me alwayes thus unhappy? <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> &s;ighed, and &s;aid; When there may be found any way, that without prejudice to my reputation, I may leave this &s;ervice, there &s;hould not be that thing in the World, which I would not do for you.

Where upon, I re&s;olved to venture my &s;elf, to relieve her. So that tying my Arms, which <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> had privately conveyed into my chamber, to a
<PB N="102" REF="60">long &s;tring of &s;ilk, I let them down to the ground, to be ready at hand, upon any occa|&s;ion; then I nimbly made another rope of the &s;heets, towell, and any other thing that came to hand, and fa&s;tned it to the bars of the win|dow, yet remaining, letting my &s;elf down; &s;topping at one knot after other, till I came at <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> now more dead then living, with grief and fear; and di&s;-intangled her, cut|ing and loo&s;ing her garments and hair from tho&s;e impediments; and accompanyed and &s;u&s;tained her, till &s;he got to the bottom. Whither be|ing come, and having put on my Armes, we im|braced in a mo&s;t endearing manner, for mutuall joy of each other's e&s;cape; and rendering <HI>Euri|&s;thus</HI> the merited applauds of his Fidelity, we made by large paces towards the Forre&s;t; for though it were our intent, to take the way to <HI>Athens,</HI> yet, on the contrary, con&s;idering the faintne&s;&s;e of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> and how that when our e&s;cape was known, we &s;hould be infallibly pur&s;ued, in danger of being overtaken; we de|termined to &s;ecure our &s;elves in the intricate|ne&s;s of the Forre&s;t's Labyrinths, and to go from thence &s;treight to the hou&s;e of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> as well to know &s;ome thing of his per&s;on, as al&s;o to provide our &s;elves with Hor&s;es; for I had a par|ticular de&s;ire to recover mine, which I intend|ed not to leave at any rate in tho&s;e woods, ha|ving travelled with him above &s;ix hundred miles. It was our fortune, that the Brook, through the dryne&s;&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, was very &s;hallow, and that <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> by long practice, was acquainted with the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;ecure&s;t
<PB N="103" REF="60">fords. <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> went through bare-foot fir&s;t, and I followed him, bearing that dear and &s;weet bur|then, the beautifull <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> in my armes. When we arrived on the other &s;ide, <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> was ravi&s;hed to &s;ee the maid I carried to be <HI>Ar|go&s;thenia,</HI> I having told him at the fir&s;t breaking of the bu&s;ine&s;s to him, that &s;he was a young la&s;s of the Ca&s;tle, that taken with my per&s;on, had de&s;ired to follow me in that e&s;cape: And de&s;iring to &s;ay very much, he could &s;peak ju&s;t nothing through the &s;tupefaction the &s;trangene&s;s of that adventure had reduced him to. So travelling gently, becau&s;e we were unwilling to engage our &s;elves by night in Valleys inhabited by Wolves, we approached by break of day to the melancholly Man&s;ion of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> which now by the departure of its Lord was become the fit &s;eat of a Forre&s;t; there not being left behind of &s;o ma|ny people, more than the Prie&s;t that officiated in the Temple, and tho&s;e inferiour &s;ervants which ordered the <HI>Orchards,</HI> and dre&s;t the Stables un|der the &s;upervi&s;ion of a Bayliffe. Here I found it confirmed that <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> deceived in the fal&s;e report of my flight, was gone to <HI>Athens</HI> to &s;eek me: therefore I de&s;ired onely thus much, that they would furni&s;h us with nece&s;saries for that voyage, and to di&s;patch news to <HI>Olympia</HI> of our deliverance, with an account of the accidents befaln us with <HI>Diambres.</HI> I de&s;ired that <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI> for her greater decency, and convenience, would take along with her &s;ome grave woman; but &s;he would not agree to it, &s;aying; that for the matter of her own per&s;on &s;he alone &s;ufficed, for other things the diligence, and a&s;&s;iduity of
<PB N="104" REF="61"><HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> was more then enough; for indeed he &s;erved her with profound affection, celerity, promptne&s;s, and reverence. So making <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> to Arm him&s;elf, and taking a good Guide, we tra|vailed &s;uccesfully by &s;mall journeys towards <HI>A|thens,</HI> till &s;uch time as coming to the Bank of the River <HI>A&s;opos,</HI> we met with an unlucky ac|cident prepared us by malicious fortune.</P>
<P><HI>Diambres</HI> being informed of my flight, and that of <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> and, which &s;eemed yet more &s;trange, of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI>'s, who by the marks left be|hind, was known to have been the Gue&s;t of my pri&s;on; he determined to be revenged at any rate, not &s;o much for any impul&s;e of hatred and pa&s;|&s;ion, as for &s;elf-intere&s;t, to the end we &s;hould not divulge the exce&s;&s;es of his barbarous incivili|ties; with repre&s;enting them moreover to the King of <HI>Thebes,</HI> to the extream endangering of his Exile, and the confi&s;cation of his goods. Un|der&s;tanding therefore, either by conjecture, or report that we had taken our way towards <HI>A|thens,</HI> and confident, that in re&s;pect of the deli|cacy of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> which he pre&s;umed to be my con&s;ort, we would go but &s;lowly, he conceited he might overtake, and retake us unexpectedly in the confines of the Dominion of <HI>Attica.</HI> He &s;elected for this purpo&s;e eight, or ten, of his brave&s;t &s;ervants and &s;wa&s;hes; and went (not as yet healed of the blow on his face) with all po&s;|&s;ible velocity to that place; and had (for his, and our misfortune) chance &s;o propitious to him, that he came upon us when we lea&s;t expected. In the place, where we came to ferry over it, the &s;tream was exceeding large with many whirle|pits,
<PB N="105" REF="61">and &s;helves very dangerous to the Pa&s;&s;en|gers, &s;o that there was no pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;ide to another, but onely with a little Boat that was there, &s;carce capable of a man and a hor&s;e. Seeing this nece&s;&s;ity, for to make way for the others, I entred fir&s;t with my hor&s;e. I would have had <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> to have been wafted over with me, in&s;tead of my hor&s;e, but the Ferry-man would not permit it, affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ming that it was a dan|gerous thing to pa&s;&s;e over hor&s;es without the cu|&s;tody of their ma&s;ters. I went over therefore alone, and the Wherry was returned to fetch the young Lady and her Palfry; but &s;he was &s;carce come to the middle of the River, when, behold <HI>Diambres,</HI> with his face, and tho&s;e of his follow|ers covered, arrived upon the &s;ame &s;hoar: and ha|ving a &s;ight of that which he went in &s;earch of, he cried to the Boat-man, that upon pain of death he &s;hould return back with the charge he conducted. <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> by his voice &amp; deportment knowing his ma&s;ter, being all this while on foot, and by that means unob&s;erved, leapt into the water to &s;wim: and I al&s;o perceiving that the Ferry-man amu&s;ed with the menaces of <HI>Diam|bres,</HI> turned the Ve&s;&s;el to make towards him, prickt forward my hor&s;e into the River to im|pede his intention; and <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> on the o|ther &s;ide, pre&s;ented a Dagger to his brea&s;t, threat|ning him with death, if he did not perform the work he had begun of wafting her over: In the &s;ame in&s;tant <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> al&s;o got up to the Boat, and attempting to leap into it, he had almo&s;t like to have &s;ubmerged it with his weight. But it being held to rights by the Art of the Steer&s;|man;
<PB N="106" REF="62">I came to graple with him, and drawing my &s;word, forced him to direct the Boat not to the &s;hoar, but along the &s;tream of the River, letting it drive at the plea&s;ure of the current, till it came to touch at an I&s;let, which I had di&s;covered, di|&s;tant about half a mile, where I promi&s;ed my &s;elf &s;ecure refuge. He obeyed, notwith&s;tanding the cries and prote&s;ts of <HI>Diambres;</HI> and I perceiving my hor&s;e began to want ground under his feet, &s;purd him back to &s;hoar, giving fir&s;t to <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> the end of a &s;tring that I had about me, that the Ferry-man &s;hould not deceive me, by turning as I &s;tood on land the Ve&s;&s;el to another part.</P>
<P>Thus we walked about three hundred paces, being followed on the oppo&s;ite Bank by <HI>Diam|bres.</HI> I had a thought, that the Bark &s;hould take the right arm of the Channel, which was very broad in that place, to the end <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> de|fended and hid by the I&s;le, might land with &s;e|curity, and free her &s;elf from the eminent peril, without <HI>Diambres</HI> his being able to pur&s;ue us in our journey; but the young Lady &s;pying by chance a youth behind me, that carried a bow and quiver like a hunt&s;-man, &s;he began to call out: To land, to land! Stay the boy, &s;tay the boy! I obeyed her, and &s;topt him, making him to &s;tay with me; and the Water-man, again&s;t his will, brought his Boat to &s;hoar. Here the fair <HI>Ar|go&s;thenia</HI> came out of the Boat, and with the help of <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> (becau&s;e he would not lend her them) took the bow and quiver from the youth, and looking plea&s;antly upon me with a &s;miling a&s;pect, &s;aid: Dear friend, the River is &s;o broad in this place, that &s;carce di&s;covering my enemy,
<PB N="107" REF="62">I cannot &s;hoot at any certainty: yet I will try my fortune. I, interrupting her, &s;aid: I be&s;eech you Madam, be plea&s;ed not to tempt blind for|tune with any advantage; Content your &s;elf, you are &s;afe, and that before our enemies can get their pa&s;&s;age over, we &s;hall be in a place where they cannot hurt us, the confines of <HI>Attica</HI> be|ing hard by: That we may do: however, &s;aid &s;he, give me leave to let fly one Arrow.

When ju&s;t at the in|&s;tant we were diverted with a neerer danger, by the appearance of a Knight which came out of a Track, made dark by the umbrage of Trees, and leading to the River &s;ide: he was attended by two other per&s;ons on hor&s;-back; which di&s;covering us bu&s;ied in that confu&s;ion, ran upon me with his &s;word drawn, crying, Ah, Traitor! It was the goodne&s;&s;e of heaven, that the hor&s;e I rode on &s;hould hear that noy&s;e, and that voyce; &s;o that I leapt a&s;ide that I might avoid that blow, which threatned me with death, <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> hereat lo&s;t not a with of time, but let fly at my unknown enemy the Dart prepared for <HI>Diambres:</HI> yet the confu&s;ion and ha&s;te with which &s;he &s;hot it, made her mi&s;&s;e the mark, and in&s;tead of the Knight, to hit his hor&s;e in the head over the left eye; where|with, what by the &s;mart, and what by the fright, he was put into &s;uch a fury, that running his crupper again&s;t a Tree he tumbled him&s;elf, and the Knight into a Ditch, which &s;eparated the road from the fields.</P>
<P>His Companions precipitou&s;ly leapt from their hor&s;es to help him, among&s;t whom I di&s;covered

<P>I was at this &s;pectacle &s;o moved with lively re&s;entments, of Pity, Grief, and Love, that I could not hinder the e&s;cape of &s;ome tears through my eyes.</P>
<P>But, who can aptly de&s;cribe the &s;orrow of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> now that &s;he knew her e&s;pou&s;ed husband, and &s;aw him in &s;o deplorable e&s;tate, af|ter &s;o cruel an attempt upon my per&s;on, and a hazard of his being &s;lain by her own hand: She knew (and perceived by my looks) that he had been deceived, whereupon flinging her &s;elf upon him, and with tears imbracing him, &s;he &s;aid.

The Cavalier, more dead then alive by &s;o grevious a fall, knew not what to &s;ay, &s;eeing <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> upon him, and me &s;o

<P>We did &s;o; And it chanced that the water was ve|ry warm, for that the Sun had but ju&s;t then began to decline its Meridian; &s;o that he found &s;ome ea&s;e of the &s;mart, which the fall had &s;trangely cau&s;ed in the nervous part of his hips. Refre&s;h|ing, and re-apparelling him&s;elf, he would have begg'd a needle&s;&s;e pardon for his mi&s;takes of me, and a brief Narrative of all our adventures. But expecting every minute <HI>Diambres</HI> at our backs, I called him back to other apprehen&s;ions, telling him; That but for the thoughts of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI>'s pre&s;ervation, which for that time was more op|portune, I would give my advice, to go (not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="110" REF="64">the di&s;equality of number and di&s;|advantages of &s;trength) to meet <HI>Diambres,</HI> and cha&s;ti&s;e him for his barbarous Tyranny: but be|cau&s;e I will not put it to the hazard of leaving her alone in an unknown Countrey, at the di&s;|cretion of &s;ickle Fortune; it behoves us with the fro&s;t of prudence to allay the ardor of gene|ro&s;ity, and betake our &s;elves to coun&s;els more cautelous than couragious. Therefore let him di|vert, though not for ever avert, his merited cha&s;ti&s;ement. As neer as I can judge, he is not now far off, and perhaps by this time is landed in the I&s;land, and ready to recover this &s;hore: now if we on the contrary go over to the other|&s;ide, &s;wimming upon our hor&s;es (&s;ince the Fer|ry-man is &s;tipt away) we &s;hall di&s;appoint his di|ligence with a journey contrary to his expecta|tion by turning towards <HI>Thebes.</HI> And &s;ince you be de&s;titute of a hor&s;e, and <HI>Eur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;thus</HI> hath likewi&s;e abandoned his upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; I will take him up behinde me; and for you and the La|dy <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> her hor&s;e may &s;erve both.

<P>The couragious Youth &s;pur'd his hor&s;e into the water, and having gone a little way with great ea&s;e, he began to feel no bottom; where|upon leaving him to &s;wim, yet guided by Bitt and Spur, that he might not make a &s;top in the water, he immediately began to &s;et foot on land, and &s;uccesfully attained the other Bank. <HI>Arnal|do</HI> did nor like that ford, fearing that either his bea&s;t, or mine, might yield in &s;wimming to the labour of &s;o great a weight: and on the other &s;ide

<P>To that <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> would by no means con|&s;ent, being unwilling &s;o much to incommode the generous Youth, to whom his former &s;ervices &s;poke her &s;o much obliged; but <HI>Arnaldo</HI> de&s;iring her to be advi&s;ed by us, &s;he obeyed.

<P>In the mean time the curio&s;ity and love of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> made her ever and anon to look back towards the Knight her &s;pou&s;e: thereupon hearing him once, angrily rating his hor&s;e, that peradventure was affrighted by the &s;welling of the Torrent, which imperuou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted him in
<PB N="112" REF="65">the mid&s;t of the &s;tream; &s;he turned her &s;elf with &s;uch ha&s;te, and carele&s;ne&s;&s;e towards him, that &s;he &s;lipt from her hor&s;e into the water, &s;inking to the bottom without any &s;tay. Providence, which would not permit her to be the food of that E|lement, had provided her of a help before the danger, by placing <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> to &s;wim behind us; for he diving pre&s;ently after her, drew her out of that dangerous current, as yet half-alive. I al&s;o at the &s;ame in&s;tant feeling bottom, leapt from my hor&s;e to help, and take her, as being far taller, and &s;tronger than <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> into my arms, and carried her a-&s;hoar. But <HI>Arnaldo</HI> in &s;eeing her fall, and knowing him&s;elf far from relieving her, was ready to throw him&s;elf for de&s;peration into the middle of the Torrent to drown him&s;elf; but co|ming to land, and &s;eeing her in my arms, he was ready to die of jealou&s;ie, renewing his former &s;u&s;pition of our Amorous corre&s;pondence. Yet di&s;&s;embling the &s;ame, he &s;tood without giving us a word: nor &s;pake I at all to him, though I per|ceived his &s;u&s;pition.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> coming to her &s;elf with rever&s;ing all the water her &s;tomack was op|pre&s;&s;ed with, &s;he began to &s;ay to me: Certainly heaven hath &s;ome wonderfull thing to do in our per&s;ons: Sir, My having received life &s;o often from your hands, and the &s;eries of dangers, through which I pa&s;&s;e every moment, makes me think, that either &s;ome very great good, or great ill, is portended to us by this encounter of fa|tality.

My coun&s;ell was approved by the contracted couple: And the Bark was made immediately to &s;tay: which we hyred to the River's mouth, with great content to the Marriners, to whom, in regard they were di&s;charged of their Lading, and bound to the &s;ame place, the money &s;eemed ea&s;ily got. Being entered therein, and the Lady having &s;upt &s;light|ly with &s;uch viands, as they gave her, and did provide at a Pea&s;ants cottage, as we pa&s;t by; but yet merrily enough, &s;ave only that <HI>Arnaldo</HI> was exceedingly troubled at <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI>'s relation of the pa&s;&s;ages under the Tyranny of <HI>Diambres:</HI> and I after &s;upper imparted to <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> the
<PB N="115" REF="66">news of <HI>Negropont,</HI> putting her in expectation of things above her hope. The morning fol|lowing, leaving <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> with the Pages in the Bark: <HI>Arnaldo</HI> and my &s;elf, to enjoy the plea&s;ure of the fields, would take Hor&s;e, ordering the Pilot &s;o to &s;teer the Ve&s;&s;ell, that it might be near at hand for us to retire to at our plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Thus we walked about a league, talking and di&s;cour&s;ing upon the expected adventure, in the revolt of <HI>Calcidonia;</HI> till we came to a little Forre&s;t of water-Poplers, which were ca&s;ually &s;prung up on tho&s;e &s;hoars, by rea&s;on the River, inclining in it's cour&s;e towards the contrary banks, wearing away the earth on that &s;ide, had left this &s;ide dry, out of which was grown up this little Wood of Willows and Poplers. Be|ing entred into it, and having gone &s;carce fif|ty paces, we were pre&s;ently &s;urrounded by about thirty Ruffians, &s;ome on foot, and &s;ome on hor&s;e-back, with their faces masked, one appearing before all the re&s;t, &s;hewing him|&s;elf to be the leader of that rout, who directed a dart at <HI>Arnaldo</HI> to lay him dead on the gra&s;&s;e: yet the blow failed the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's expectation; for it pa&s;t between the &s;ide, and the arm, of the Knight, doing him no other harm, but gliding along his cloths gave a little race to his skin: But <HI>Arnaldo</HI>'s blow, did not in that manner fail him; for pre&s;ently laying hand on his &s;word, he threw him&s;elf with &s;uch an impetuo&s;ity upon the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, that running him through and through, he fell dead to the ground. On the other&s;ide, being unwilling to dye unrevenged, I did what I could; and if the hour of my death
<PB N="116" REF="67">had been by Heaven decreed to have been then, I certainly de&s;erved it, by what I then did. But what could three per&s;ons alone do again&s;t thirty Villains? <HI>Arnaldo</HI>'s Squire was &s;lain, and he and I were &s;o &s;orely wounded in many parts of our bodyes, that we fell half dead, and as they thought wholly life-le&s;&s;e, upon the ground.</P>
<P>Yet I, as being le&s;&s;e hurt, pre&s;ently re-a&s;&s;um'd my &s;pirits that were fled, and opened my eyes, &s;oon again grown &s;ad by the &s;ight of &s;ix dead bodies (for of that number as yet <HI>Arnaldo</HI> appeared:) but &s;eeing my hor&s;e clo&s;e by me, as if he had been condoling me; I gathered thence, that it was not to rob, but to murther us, that they had &s;o rudely handled us. Rai&s;ing up my &s;elf therefore the be&s;t I might, and &s;earching my wounds, I found my &s;elf hurt in the thigh, and the left &s;ide; in the arm, and right &s;houlder; and in the middle of my belly; of all which wounds, only this la&s;t &s;eemed mor|tall. I bound it up therefore before the re&s;t, and would go vi&s;ite the dead body of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> and finding him &s;till breathing, I comforted my &s;elf; and, bringing him better to him&s;elf, he &s;lowly and heavily opened his eyes, and &s;car&s;e knowing me clo&s;ed them up again, as if at that in&s;tant he had breathed out his Soul. Seeing him in &s;o mi&s;erable a condition, I &s;trived to get upon my Hor&s;e, to &s;eek out &s;ome better means for his &s;uccour: but in vain. For the Marriners hearing the noi&s;e of the fight, and &s;eeing per|haps &s;ome of the Rogues along the &s;hore, had (notwith&s;tanding the cryes of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI>) with &s;ails and oars &s;o ha&s;tned the voyage, that
<PB N="117" REF="67">they were gone above two leagues from that place in an hour.</P>
<P>Being unwilling therefore to abandon the Knight in tho&s;e mi&s;erable extremit yes, I return|ed into the wood, and found by chance two Pea&s;ants pa&s;&s;ing that way, with intention to rob the dead bodyes, whom (though at my coming they began to run away) I &s;o far engaged with my cariage and language, promi&s;ing them a rich reward for that &s;ervice, that they &s;tayed: and under&s;tanding that they were &s;ons to two la|bouring men of tho&s;e parts, I de&s;ired one of them, which I thought more di&s;creet than the other, to goe and call them, to carry that Gentleman into &s;ome convenient place, where to cure or bury him. The young man ran, encouraged by the reward, and returned expe|ditiou&s;ly with his father, and a girl, who went for the good-mans daughter; which being &s;ud|denly come to us, &s;he flung her &s;elf upon the face of the Cavalier, and muttered I know not what charms, &s;o that he pre&s;ently returned again to him&s;elf. Afterwards &s;he told me, &s;he would ask no more, but onely that &s;he might be permitted to try her &s;ecrets, to cure that almo&s;t-dead bo|dy, being oppre&s;t with &s;ix mortall wounds. I &s;aw &s;he &s;poke with di&s;cretion, and that the Knight grew wor&s;e every moment, therefore I told her, She &s;hould do her plea&s;ure. So &s;he &s;earched his wounds, but would let none &s;ee how &s;he would cure him; for &s;he would not ac|cept of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; as in like manner &s;he re|fu&s;ed all help in dre&s;&s;ing me, though in a diffe|rent manner, having &s;uddenly &s;ecured our lives,
<PB N="118" REF="68">without giving us the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to learn tho&s;e &s;ecets. What &s;hall I &s;ay? In four and twenty hours I beheld <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> whom I had bemoaned as dead, healed: and I, that was like|ly to live kept my bedd a month, almo&s;t in de|&s;pair of recovery. But the Cavalier, though he was extreamly loath to leave me alone in that Village, yet in the end, con&s;trained by his duty, and by my intreaties, he went towards the Mouth of the River in &s;earch of <HI>Argo&s;thenia;</HI> and I remained, though &s;o &s;orely di&s;ea&s;ed, to enjoy the plea&s;ing conver&s;ation of the young Dam&s;el, my Doctre&s;&s;e and Keeper.</P>

<P>THe Leader of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;lain by the hand of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> was the Tyrant <HI>Diambres;</HI> who in the pa&s;&s;age which wee made along the little I&s;land, where he had for that night took up his lodging, knew by my Hor&s;e, which with tho&s;e others of our company, &s;tood upon the fore-deck of the Ship, who was his ma&s;ter, and learnt &s;omething al&s;o of the arivall and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of <HI>Arnaldo;</HI> whil&s;t we &s;tayed to &s;up, and whil&s;t the Marriners were at &s;upper (which took up three hours time) he got before us with his attendants, to weave &s;ome new trechery: &s;up|po&s;ing that <HI>Arnaldo</HI> would go attended &s;plen|didly, according to his quality. So he gave no|tice
<PB N="119" REF="68">to &s;ome vile people of tho&s;e parts, that we were exiled from <HI>Thebes,</HI> and were flying to <HI>Negropont:</HI> he moreover incouraged them to &s;lay us, to gain a great &s;um, which as he affirm|ed, was &s;et upon our heads. But he being the fir&s;t that was &s;lain, in attempting of this exe|crable enterpri&s;e, and after him three of his be&s;t Souldiers, it occa&s;ioned that the Villains, (ad|verti&s;ed by the flight of the other retainers to <HI>Diambres,</HI> that that affair would &s;ucceed very contrary to what he had told them&punc;) for our good fortune left us all, &s;ome alive, &s;ome dead upon the ground, every one retireing to his own hou&s;e, le&s;t they &s;hould be accu&s;ed of &s;uch a murder. <HI>Arnaldo</HI> being healed as I told you, and departed in que&s;t of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, I kept my bed &s;till, under the amorous and dear charge of the fair <HI>Or&s;ina.</HI> And becau&s;e her garb, her looks, and her vertues, &s;pake her to be more then the daughter of a Farmer, I de&s;ired one day to know from her &s;uppo&s;ed mother <HI>Serena,</HI> the truth of matters, concerning her; and &s;he with a deportment, &s;avoring not a jot of rurall, thus &s;poke to me.</P>

<PB N="120" REF="69">
<P>There went, now &s;ixteen years agoe, to <HI>Corinth,</HI> upon occa&s;ions of his &s;tudyes, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, of great birth, but greater virtue: he put him&s;elf to lodge, according to the cu&s;tom of Scholars, in the hou&s;e of a young and come|ly woman, a Citizen, which being left a Widow in the flower of her years, with &s;ome Fortune, in movable goods, had applyed her &s;elf to this Calling, very profitable in that City, of boarding <HI>Tran&s;-mountanian</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;-marine</HI> Scholars, which were wont to become the mo&s;t mode&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;tudious, of all tho&s;e about our parts; whereas ours commonly abandoned them&s;elves to all di&s;&s;olutene&s;&s;e. Now, as it &s;hould happen, the&s;e two, being both alike young, and fair, they were mutually enamoured of one another; their names were <HI>Ro&s;mond</HI> and <HI>Camilla,</HI> and making u&s;e of their liberty and familiarity, there was both of them this goodly child <HI>Or&s;ina.</HI> The love of the daughter, no le&s;&s;e than that of the mother, detained <HI>Ro&s;mond</HI> at <HI>Corinth</HI> &s;ome five or &s;ix years; whence at la&s;t being nece&s;&s;ita|to depart about urgent affaires, he left about three thou&s;and Ducates, in a&s;&s;ignment of Portion to <HI>Or&s;ina,</HI> and pretious gifts moreover and above to her Mother. She notwith&s;tanding, conti|nued to lodge Gentlemen of &s;uch like quality: &amp; <HI>Or&s;ina</HI> came by that means to learn, not onely foraign Languages, but al&s;o the Principles of the Sciences, e&s;pecially Phy&s;ik &amp; Chirurgery: in which profe&s;&s;ions, &s;he is able to do &s;trange things with onely two or three words, as what &s;he hath experimented in <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> whom &s;he hath rai&s;ed from death to life, may ea&s;ily per&s;wade you.
<PB N="121" REF="69">It happened in this mean time, that certain con|te&s;ts aro&s;e among the Scholars, her gue&s;ts; which breaking into blows, &s;ome of them were &s;lain at the table, mingling their blood with their victualls and wine. Whereat, <HI>Camilla</HI> being afrighted, and fearing to be cited before the Judges, &s;he packt up all her riche&s;t movables, with what money &s;he could pre&s;ently get toge|ther, and imbarkt her &s;elf for <HI>Athens:</HI> where not holding her &s;elf for all that &s;ecure enough, &s;he would go into <HI>Negropont,</HI> as being a disjunct Juri&s;diction from the Dominion of <HI>Attica,</HI> and &s;tayed her voyage in this place, and in the end, dyed in this hou&s;e; fir&s;t leaving, and recom|mending to my charge, this her daughter, now twelve years of age.

Now <HI>Or&s;ina</HI> having often entreated me to carry her to <HI>Corinth,</HI> to procure for her the Dowry, left her by her Father, and to marry her; I could never prevail with my husband to content her; for having never gone out of the bounds of the&s;e Villages, he fears the world will fall on his head, if he hear but any &s;trange Country named. If you &s;hall plea&s;e therefore,
<PB N="122" REF="70">gentle Sir, to favor this maid with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &amp; protection, though my husband gain&s;ay it, yet being informed by <HI>Arnaldo</HI> of your noble qual|lities, I will con&s;igne to you that little Coyn, and &s;uch Jewells as I have left in my hands by her Mother; a&s;&s;uring my &s;elf, that &s;he cannot but arive &s;afely to the end of her de&s;ires.

<P>I was well plea&s;ed with the conver&s;ation and the Virtue of <HI>Or&s;ina,</HI> but the taking &s;uch troubles upon my &s;elf, was a thing wholly con|trary to my Genius and inclinations: And the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> had made me to know by proof, what I might expect from travelling up and down the world with Women, e&s;pecial|ly young and hand&s;om. Yet the intreaties of the child being added to the per&s;wa&s;ions of the woman, and knowing my &s;elf obliged to her for my health, I promi&s;ed, that &s;o &s;oon as I was di&s;-engaged from the company of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> I would conduct her to <HI>Corinth,</HI> to her Parents hou&s;e: and it fell out &s;ooner than I thought for: For, <HI>Euri&s;tus</HI> coming to &s;ee me with Letters from <HI>Arnaldo;</HI> I knew not how to reward him for my liberty, which I obtained by his means, bet|ter than by giving him <HI>Or&s;ina</HI> in marriage, un|der the notion of my Daughter, with all that depo&s;ited by her Father, as the Inheritance of her Mother, with a con&s;iderable ri&s;e to his for|tune.</P>
<PB N="123" REF="70">
<P>The advice brought me by <HI>Euri&s;tus,</HI> was, that <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> having found <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> at the mouth of <HI>A&s;opos,</HI> expecting of him, they had de|termined to return together to that Village, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my di&s;temper, till I was recovered: But having deferred it, by rea&s;on of <HI>Cadmus</HI> be|ing indi&s;po&s;ed, and withall, to under&s;tand my plea&s;ure; I, that already was aware, that <HI>Ar|naldo,</HI> for all his genero&s;ity, langui&s;hed with a jealou&s;y of me, and that this re&s;olution, of coming back, was a motion of <HI>Argo&s;thenia;</HI> as it was on the other &s;ide an invention of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> to remit it to my di&s;po&s;all: and being de&s;irous withall to &s;ee my &s;elf at liberty, to travell the world according to my purpo&s;ed intent, I imme|diatly di&s;patcht back <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> to intreat them both, that they would not incommode them|&s;elves for my &s;ake, but pur&s;ue the cour&s;e of their own fortune, and go to <HI>Calcides,</HI> to ce|lebrate with &s;olemnity their Nuptialls, by con|&s;ent of the Dutche&s;&s;e, from who&s;e plea&s;ure did depend their felicity, and advancement: For that when I was ridd of my infirmity, I would wait upon them in per&s;on, at a time, when my urgent affairs would better permit. Yet I &s;hould, where-ever I came, and in all conditions, of e&s;tate, and fortune, ever bear in mind the obli|gations received from them both, to pre&s;erve them fre&s;h in my memory, to the la&s;t moment of my life.</P>
<P><HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> returned with new Letters from <HI>Ar|naldo</HI> and <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> who by all means de&s;ired me to be at <HI>Calcides,</HI> before the di&s;clo&s;ing of them&s;elves, being willing to have me pre&s;ent at
<PB N="124" REF="71">the opening of that Scene. But I re&s;olved to travell to <HI>Corinth,</HI> to &s;ettle <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> and <HI>Or&s;ina,</HI> and free my &s;elf from this new &s;ugge&s;tion. And it was the goodne&s;&s;e of de&s;tiny, &s;o to di&s;|po&s;e of it; for if new accidents of adver&s;e for|tune &s;hould cro&s;&s;e their de&s;ign, I &s;hould be al&s;o inevitably much concernd in it, without any other fruit, but onely that of a mi&s;erable con|&s;tancy of fidelity, and an infortunate amity.</P>
<P>They therefore hired a Bark, to tran&s;port them to <HI>Calcides:</HI> and &s;carce had they put out of the Port, but they were taken by a Pinnace of Pirats, belonging to <HI>Rhodes,</HI> who pre&s;ently fettered <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> and re&s;erved <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> upon ac|count of her extream beauty, for a mighty ran|&s;om; pa&s;&s;ing to unlade their wealthy booty at <HI>Scarpanto;</HI> where they &s;old <HI>Arnaldo</HI> (though he promi&s;ed them great ran&s;oms, and let them know his quality) to a very covetous and chur|li&s;h Merchant, who notwith&s;tanding the come|line&s;&s;e of his per&s;on, and the offers made by him of va&s;t &s;ums, &s;ent him to work in certain Vineyards of his, in a Village in the Country. <HI>Arnaldo</HI> being a&s;&s;aulted, but not vanqui&s;hed by &s;o &s;trong gu&s;ts of fortune, inured him&s;elf to this cour&s;e of life, in hope of &s;peedy redem|ption, having found out a way to di&s;patch Let|ters to <HI>Thebes,</HI> letting his friends know his mi&s;ery, that &s;o he might be &s;et at liberty, with force of gold, and the interpo&s;ition of the re|gall power.

<PB N="125" REF="71">accidents of adver&s;e fortune: verifying in his per&s;on, but too much, the title which he bore of the <HI>Injur'd Lover.</HI></P>
<P>But from the &s;elf-&s;ame con&s;ideration that trou|bled him, did ari&s;e the cau&s;e of his &s;ecurity; tho&s;e barbarous villains, having for their more profit till then pre&s;erved her incontaminated. She yet never cea&s;ed weeping in that her cap|tivity, wherein &s;he was deprived of all comforts: and were it not that &s;he was loath to wi&s;h him &s;o much unhappine&s;&s;e, &s;he could in that calamity have de&s;ired the conver&s;ation of <HI>Philiternus.</HI> Af|ter a time, the Pyrats &s;et &s;ayl for <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and there expo&s;ed to &s;ale that precious merchandize, the admirable <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> as a thing de&s;ired by many, though but few were found, who dur&s;t buy her at &s;o exce&s;sive a price, as the Pyrates &s;et up|on her, which was no le&s;&s;e then twenty thou&s;and Ducats; there being none would venture &s;o much money on a Jewel, which, though lovely in extremity, might in an hour, change and lo&s;e all its beauty.</P>
<P>But that which one alone could not do, three young Gallants together, (to their own ruin) attempted: who being otherwi&s;e intimate friends, agreed to buy her joyntly, to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e her al&s;o to|gether by turns. Fools that they were, not to con&s;ider, <HI>That women were made to part, not to unite the Wills of men:</HI> and, <HI>That the Throne and Bed dete&s;t competition.</HI> The money being di&s;|bur&s;ed, their agreement being for eighteen thou|&s;and Ducats, they conducted the innocent prize to the hou&s;e of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> the principal of the Purcha&s;ors, where the other two, <HI>Hermogenes</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="72">and <HI>Arbant</HI> fell into a conte&s;t with him, Who &s;hould enjoy her the fir&s;t night: He treating them with very unworthy terms, &s;aid; that all rea&s;on required, that for nobility and fortune be|ing their better, the precedency in that Love was his of right. <HI>Arbant,</HI> by this time grown all into a fury, told him, that having equally di&s;pen|ded his money as well as he, he knew not how to yield to him in this matter. <HI>Hermogenes,</HI> of a more tranquill mind, was content to remit the deci&s;ion of it to Lot: but not being hearkned to by the other two, they broke out into &s;uch terms of rage, that <HI>Arbant</HI> challenged <HI>Antiochus</HI> out of his hou&s;e, and after an ob&s;tinate Combat <HI>Antio|chus</HI> was &s;lain, and <HI>Arbant</HI> &s;o ill handled, that he did not &s;urvive him many dayes. <HI>Hermogenes</HI> as the third buyer, challenged the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fair Captive, but he was joyntly denied her by the Heirs of <HI>Antiochus</HI> and <HI>Arbant,</HI> till he had repayed them the &s;ums contributed by the de|funct parties to that mournfull purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>But <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> cut off this contention: for, engaging to her the women of <HI>Antiochus</HI> his hou&s;e, with the di&s;covery of her quality and misfortunes, they were moved with &s;uch a com|pa&s;&s;ion of her calamities, that they helped her to e&s;cape, being di&s;gui&s;ed in boy's apparrel; ha|ving fir&s;t &s;omething &s;hortned her hair, and di&s;co|loured her face.</P>

Here <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI> landed in the morning, leaving the old woman in the Bark for &s;ecurity, and went to the hou&s;e where <HI>Arnaldo</HI> was &s;old. But learning he was gone to his ma&s;ters Countrey-hou&s;e to work, &s;he was exceeding glad. And becau&s;e it was but three miles off, &s;he went thither upon the wings of Love, and of de&s;ire, in a &s;hort &s;pace;
<PB N="128" REF="73">and &s;eeking of him, &s;he was brought to the place with much courte&s;ie by a certain hone&s;t woman. She found him with his Fetters at his heels, and his Mattock and Spade going to work, and was &s;o moved in mind at &s;o deplorable a &s;pectacle, that not able to keep upon her feet, &s;he &s;unk down with &s;orrow and regret.</P>
<P><HI>Arnaldo</HI> and the woman ran to help her, a|mazed with the &s;trangene&s;&s;e of the accident. But their words nothing availing, the woman ran to her hou&s;e to fetch &s;ome Vinegar, Water, and Wine, and the like, to bring her again to her &s;elf; and in the mean time the confu&s;ion of <HI>Arnaldo</HI> much increa&s;ed, thinking he knew the features of that beautiful vi&s;age; howbeit, that her &s;hort hair, and Olive-coloured face, and mans apparel, made <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> unknowable. But &s;he returning to her &s;elf, and taking an opportunity when the wo|man was returned with her implements to her hou&s;e, &s;he &s;aid to the Knight. <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> a per&s;on of your acquaintance &s;ent me to &s;alute you from her. Here is a Bark of certain Fi&s;her-men of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> in which I come to finde you, promi&s;ing them ten Ducats upon my word; if you plea&s;e to lend them me, I will leave you a pawn &s;hall countervail them a hundred times.</P>
<P><HI>Arnaldo</HI> an&s;wered, that for money he had none, but yet he would procure &s;ome by that womans means to &s;erve her upon a Chain, which he wore at his brea&s;t. And I al&s;o, &s;aid <HI>Argo&s;the|nia,</HI> have Gold to make money of; and &s;o &s;aying, drew forth her Necklace: when <HI>Arnaldo</HI> &s;aw that, growing pale, he ask't her, Who gave her it? Your &s;elf, &s;aid &s;he. And is it po&s;&s;ible that through this
<PB N="129" REF="73">di&s;gui&s;e you &s;hould not perceive <HI>Argo&s;thenia? Arnaldo</HI> trembled and &s;igh'd with fear and joy at tho&s;e words, and if he had not perceived the wo|man returning, he would have imbraced her in his arms. But, di&s;gui&s;ing the matter, he turned his &s;peech to the woman, and de&s;ired to pro|cure (not on the Necklace, but) upon a Brace|let that <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> gave him, twenty Ducats for that young man to imploy in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The woman mi&s;tru&s;ting nothing, but thinking to receive &s;ome benefit to her &s;elf, went pre|&s;ently about it, in which mean time <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> gave <HI>Arnaldo</HI> relation of her adventures, and of her intent to get him thence by one means or an|other; for if he would but return with her in that Fi&s;her-boat to <HI>Rhodes,</HI> he &s;hould be &s;ure un|der her conduct to find more ea&s;ily &s;ome way to tran&s;port them&s;elves for <HI>Negropont. Arnaldo</HI> wept extreamly to hear her &s;trange fortunes, in being born for the death of &s;o many per&s;ons; but in particular as to the getting out of that &s;lave|ry, he could not upon a &s;udden contrive a way to effect it; there being no other way to the Haven, but through the Citie: where in the day-time he would be &s;tay'd, and in the night he could not get out, in regard he was loaded with Chains. <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> &s;igned, and pau&s;ing awhile, &s;he &s;aid. When the We&s;tern Knight freed me from the thraldom of <HI>Diambres,</HI> we filed a&s;under in two hours the Iron-bars of a Window; and, Is there no way to break the Chains that are about your feet? But where &s;hall we find (&s;aid <HI>Arnaldo</HI>) &s;uch a kind of file, in &s;o forlorn a place? Think not of that, &s;aid <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> here's that will do
<PB N="130" REF="74">the work: And pulled forth a little flat Gla&s;&s;e Vial, about the bigne&s;&s;e of a Nut, &s;aying. Before the Cavalier cut the bars, he put &s;ome of this wa|ter on them, of which he gave me this Cru&s;e. But in the u&s;ing it, you mu&s;t have a care you touch it not with your finger, le&s;t its malevolent nature &s;hould hurt you. Hereupon <HI>Arnaldo</HI> pulled a little Cotton out of the quilting of his Doublet, and, ju&s;t dipping it in the water, ba|thed the Lock that fettered his feet, according to the direction of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> and he pre&s;ently &s;aw the admirable effect; for, being made of pure Iron without the help of a file, it flew open; whereas in the grate of <HI>Diambres,</HI> the Iron being Steeled the help of files was al&s;o requi&s;ite.</P>
<P><HI>Arnaldo</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf at liberty, My dear Soul (&s;aid he) let's not &s;tay any longer here, where we can expect no advantage: but let us leave the Bracelet to this woman, in reward of her civilities to me. I am certain &s;he cannot re|turn this hour: and by that time &s;he doth come back, the Gates will be &s;hut; &s;o that we cannot enter without being &s;een. And this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e likewi&s;e would be done pre&s;ently, in regard all the people of the&s;e parts are gone into the Mountains to vintage, upon which occa&s;ion not &s;o much as the little Children are left at home, it being, at this time of vintage, permitted to every one to eat as much as they plea&s;e. And again, we &s;hall come to the Citie in an hour, wherein we &s;hall be unob&s;erved, for it will be about nine of the Clock. And afterwards we will follow the coun&s;el of <HI>Philiternus,</HI> who advi&s;eth that, in all Enterpri&s;es, <HI>We mu&s;t &s;till give place to
<PB N="131" REF="74">Fortune, who is alwayes a friend of re&s;olute Souls</HI> Let us go Madam. <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> thought it an Age, till &s;he &s;aw her Spou&s;e freed from that cap|tivity, and therefore would not contradict him, but made u&s;e of Fortune's favour.</P>
<P>What need more words? They came by hap|py providence &s;afe to the Port, the Citie being open, and without Guards in that hour of re|tirement: But yet there they met with another accident to cro&s;&s;e them; for <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> having, in&s;tead of the promi&s;ed money, brought the Fi&s;her-men a man, in Garb very &s;u&s;pitious, they would take neither of them into the Bark. <HI>Ar|naldo</HI> a good while patiently endured their im|pertinencies; but at la&s;t, &s;eeing there was no other way to per&s;wade them, he pluckt out an|other Bracelet of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI>'s, and offered it them for &s;atisfaction of that their &s;ervice. Then the Fi&s;her-men had &s;o much the more &s;u&s;pition of his per&s;on: and were beginning to put off from the &s;hoar, being unwilling to receive per|&s;ons that were to be &s;u&s;pected, either of Flight, or of Theft. <HI>Arnaldo</HI> by this time, being enraged by nece&s;&s;ity with an extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion, and not u&s;ual in him, leapt into the Bark, and &s;natch|ing up an Oare, menaced with an au&s;tere, and terrible look, pre&s;ently to di&s;patch him that offered to oppo&s;e him; whereupon not having the courage to defend them&s;elves, two (of five that they were) leapt, for fear, upon the &s;hoar. <HI>Arnaldo</HI> being hereby the better &s;ecured, took into his cu&s;tody two Spears, two Bows, and all the Arms and Swords he found; and helping <HI>Ar|go&s;thenia</HI> aboard, commanded him that &s;ate at
<PB N="132" REF="75">Stern to turn the Prow towards <HI>Candia,</HI> promi|&s;ing him the recompence due to his good &s;er|vice, and al&s;o to cha&s;ti&s;e his villany, if he de|ceived him. The Fi&s;her-men &s;eeing their cro&s;&s;e fortune, re-entred their Bark: for <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> had al&s;o bent a Bow, and was ready to &s;hoot any that &s;hould refu&s;e; determining to obey that cro&s;&s;e nece&s;&s;ity, which had yet &s;ucceeded more favourably than they hoped for: &s;eeing that ha|ving made <HI>Candia,</HI> where <HI>Arnaldo</HI> held corre|&s;pondence of con&s;anguinity and friend&s;hip, he gave them fifty Ducats, and &s;o &s;ent them home plea&s;ed, who came out &s;o unwillingly.</P>
<P>Here, becau&s;e the Cavalier would not make him&s;elf known in that condition, he bought with the Jewels of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> honourable habits for both: and took with him a Page, and the old woman that &s;till followed them, &s;ayling along the Coa&s;ts of the I&s;le, till he came to <HI>Sidonia,</HI> where report went, that &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els lay ready to &s;et &s;ayl for <HI>Athens.</HI> And finding it ju&s;t as he de&s;ired, he embarqued in a We&s;tern Ve&s;&s;el, wherein &s;ayling pro&s;perou&s;ly as far as the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> the wind, which hitherto had fa|voured them with benign gales, now became treacherous, ama&s;&s;ing Clouds in the aire, and rowling the Sea up&s;ide down, with a Tempe&s;t the more &s;ad and dangerous, by how much the le&s;&s;e it was expected and feared. This &s;torm conti|nued three dayes and three nights in its fury, during which time, what they got of their voy|age by advancing forward, they lo&s;t again by dri|ving backward. On the fourth day, when as the weather began to calm, they could no longer
<PB N="133" REF="75">&s;teer their Ve&s;&s;el, that was grown old already with many years continual &s;cuffling with the waves: they &s;plit her upon a Rock right again&s;t the Pro|vince of <HI>Argos;</HI> but with &s;o good fortune to the Pa&s;&s;engers and Marriners, that it endangered no mans life, and the damage of very little of the lading. Unfortunate <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> did very ill re|&s;ent this adventure, and fell with impatience and anger into an extream di&s;temper. And yet there was not wanting &s;ome, who leapt on &s;hoar to free her from that danger, which they had run in the Tempe&s;tuou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Sea.</P>
<P>The Captain of the &s;hip had ca&s;t his eye on this miraculous Creature: but re&s;pect to <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> who &s;eemed to be of a quality not to be toucht without danger; and the turbulence of the Sea had put a &s;top to the licentious thoughts of this man; who, although inured from his Cradle to that &s;ordid kind of life, was too flexible of heart to with&s;tand the Amorous Darts, &s;parkling in the lively eyes of incomparable <HI>Argo&s;thenia.</HI> But be|ing run upon the Rock through the nece&s;sity of the &s;hip-wrack; while <HI>Arnaldo</HI> having accom|modated his dear Spou&s;e the be&s;t he could, at the foot of a Grot under the cu&s;tody of her old &s;er|vant; and taking his Page with him, was gone to &s;eek if there were any Harbour in that de&s;art, or any people to give them relief; There came the &s;trange&s;t capriccio into the head of the villainous Captain that could be imagined: and it was, to ravi&s;h away the young Lady, and clap her aboard the skiff, &s;o to fly to the next &s;hoar, before <HI>Ar|naldo</HI> &s;hould return. The conception of &s;o vitu|perious an enterprize was in&s;tantly &s;econded
<PB N="134" REF="76">with the execution. Thus, in de&s;pight of the remon&s;trance made by the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, which for his own intere&s;ts would not con&s;ent upon any terms to his departure; drawing to him &s;ome Souldiers and Marriners, he mounted the Schiff with the ravi&s;hed Lady, who was &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;e through exce&s;&s;ive grief, and plying the Oars di&s;|imbarqued in four hours &s;pace upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Epidaurus.</HI> But what a tran&s;port was <HI>Arnaldo</HI> in, when, returning from his fruitle&s;&s;e que&s;t to &s;helter, he found not the puple of his eye, which was &s;o dear unto him; but &s;o &s;trange a Tyranny of fortune, ever con&s;tant in abu&s;ing him? I ve|rily believe that if <HI>Methrodorus,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, and other people that &s;tayed with him, had not prevented him by main &s;trength, he would either have buried his &s;word in his own brea&s;t, or would have flung him&s;elf with a more inevi|table wrack, than that he had e&s;cap't, into the Sea. But fir&s;t re&s;trained by violence, and after|wards recomforted in part by the per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Methrodorus,</HI> which promi&s;ed him to put him on &s;hoar, and to overtake that fugitive Traitour before the infirmity of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> would &s;uffer him to arrive to the abominated end of his de|&s;igns; he de&s;i&s;ted from his de&s;perate determina|tion. Thereupon, <HI>Methrodorus</HI> collecting all the goods, both his own and others, that having not taken wet might be&s;t be &s;aved; he hid them in that cave, to return, and fetch them when for|rune &s;hould be more favourable, and &s;et to build with his company (<HI>Arnaldo</HI> him&s;elf putting his hand to the work) of the reliques of the &s;hip another &s;chiff, &amp; in le&s;&s;e then twenty four hours

<P>Three moneths were already &s;pent before that, being impeded by the wounds I had received, and by the Nuptials of <HI>Or&s;ina</HI> and <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> I could begin my journey to <HI>Corinth.</HI> In the mean time &s;eeing neither Me&s;&s;enger, nor Expre&s;&s;e from the <HI>Injur'd Lover,</HI> or his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, I toucht up|on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Attica</HI> towards <HI>Negropont,</HI> to know &s;omething of their voyage undertaken for <HI>Calcides;</HI> where, hearing a flying rumour of their Captivity, I was ready to die of grief. Yet not knowing whither to go, or what to do in their relief; I determined to pa&s;&s;e by the way of <HI>A|thens</HI> to <HI>Corinth.</HI> Whither being arived, and ha|ving left the young couple among their friends, I had a de&s;ire before my return into my own Countrey, to &s;ee &s;ome of the mo&s;t fam'd Ci|ties of <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> I made choice in this bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e (for Camrades) of <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> two young Gentlemen of <HI>Me&s;&s;enia,</HI> which ha|ving ended their &s;tudies, were returning home; we went fir&s;t from <HI>Corinth</HI> to <HI>Argos,</HI> where &s;pend|ing but two dayes, we traveled towards <HI>Epidau|rus.</HI> But being over-taken by night at a Village, &s;ix miles di&s;tant from the Citie, towards the Sea-Coa&s;ts, whil'&s;t that we were &s;eeking among&s;t tho&s;e Countrey people for a Lodging, we en|countred with a Souldier, who enquired for a Litter, to fetch from a place not above half a mile off, a &s;ick young Lady, which he &s;aid was &s;hip-wrack't in the late Tempe&s;t. <HI>Alexander</HI> my Camrade, was the mo&s;t capricious man in
<PB N="136" REF="77">the world; and alwayes a de&s;irer of rambling adventures: Having therefore heard &s;o much, it was needle&s;&s;e to per&s;wade him to go &s;ee this Dam&s;ell. And becau&s;e the Souldier &s;aid, that &s;he was alone with one onely maid, and him|&s;elf, pretending to be her &s;ervant; with a noble freedom, he offered (&s;eeing there was not one of tho&s;e clowns that would &s;et foot out of doors at that time of night about &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e) him&s;elf to &s;erve that Lady, with his own Hor&s;e to bring her to &s;ome place of accommoda|tion.</P>
<P>The proffer of our Comrade, obliged us to tender the like courte&s;y; but being rudely re|pul&s;ed by the Souldier, directly refu&s;ing our ci|vility and genero&s;ity, <HI>Alexander</HI> per&s;i&s;ted the the more in his humour of &s;eeing that Lady: And turning to me, laughing; Sir, &s;aid he, ex|cu&s;e my indi&s;cretion. Night is already &s;hut in, and this clowni&s;h rout &s;hew them&s;elves unwil|ling to entertain us. We have been heretofore ac|cu&s;tomed to watching in our wild night-rounds at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and therefore it will do us no great hurt, to prolong our journy for two or three hours, till we come to &s;ome Town, where we may meet with lodgings fit for us, going fir&s;t to &s;ee this Lady, to tender to her in per&s;on our &s;er|vice; and, Who knows, but we may find her as courteous, as her &s;ervant is rude and uncivill? I, that was born &s;till to make my friend's plea|&s;ure my Law, readily proffered my &s;elf to wait on him; but <HI>Hercules</HI> did exceedingly oppo&s;e it; were it that, wearyed by his journy, he de&s;ired to take his re&s;t, or el&s;e, that fore-&s;eeing in his
<PB N="137" REF="77">mind the approaching danger, he would give way to &s;uch an impul&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>Alexander</HI> prevailing, and taking along with us, for our guid, one of tho&s;e Country-fel|lows, we rid towards that place: where in|&s;tead of a &s;ick Lady, we found &s;ix men of &s;avage a&s;pect, and in a deportment (excepting one of them) liker gally-&s;laves than Souldiers. Yet we perceived by their po&s;ture, that either they &s;tood in doubt of them&s;elves, or kept &s;ome &s;e|cret they de&s;ired not to have known. And we were confirmed in our opinion, in that at our appearing, they had either put out or hid two torches, which they carryed to illuminate the darkne&s;&s;e of the night, which, by this time, had wholy over&s;pread the great face of Heaven; yet it's ob&s;curity began to dimini&s;h, by rea&s;on of the exceeding clarity of the Moon, than ri|&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Hercules</HI> by this time half angry, &s;aid to <HI>Alex|ander:</HI> See here the young Lady, which you expected to complement: <HI>Alexander</HI> laugh'd, and replyed; Even from the antient <HI>Sileni,</HI> aro&s;e matters of wonder, and who knows but the&s;e <HI>Cyplop's</HI> faces, may wait on &s;ome <HI>Venus?</HI> Yea, replyed I, but there being no fire in this Forge, we go in &s;ome danger, and in&s;tead of a <HI>Venus</HI> that we would conduct to a logding, we may find &s;ome <HI>Vulcan,</HI> that may throw a hammer at our heads.

It matters not much, &s;aid I: fot however this Lady have &s;lighted us, the Moon &s;hall &s;erve as a guid to light us.

Under&s;tanding by her rela|tion, that the Skiff was left tyed to that &s;hoare, I de&s;ired <HI>Alexander</HI> to ride and &s;ee if happily there were any of the Mariners left; for there being no other way to &s;ecure <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> than by conducting her that way to <HI>Epidaurus</HI> (more|over, it was requi&s;ite, to take care for the body of our unfortunate Camrade, and for his own &s;afty) thinking to win them with good treat|ment, and by taking no notice of their default in that dete&s;table enterpri&s;e. He went, but found onely the Bark: whereupon di&s;pairing of help, any other way, I re&s;umed my former familiarity with <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> and carryed her in my arms unto that place: where we found &s;ome &s;mall commodity of meat, and of a bed for the Lady. I made a fire and &s;erved her for Nur&s;e, Phy&s;ician, and keeper, whereat &s;he was &s;o af|fected, that &s;he continually wept for tender|ne&s;&s;e. Next, I made u&s;e of a Secret, taught me by the fair <HI>Orfina,</HI> in order to the cure of <HI>Alex|ander;</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="80">And making him al&s;o to take a little re&s;t, I returned with the old woman to the fields, and laying the body of <HI>Hercules</HI> upon his hor&s;e, I got him al&s;o aboard the boat, and hid him in a private place of the &s;ame, to the end he &s;hould not with his &s;ight trouble the mind of my pati|ents; and la&s;t of all clo&s;ed my eyes for a little while, to e&s;&s;ay the dulcity of &s;leep, clo&s;e by my hor&s;e, which that night, in&s;tead of hay and provender, fed on bisket and poudred bief, like a Mariner.</P>
<P>Day appearing, and my company awaking, we di&s;covered a new &s;cene of wonder upon that &s;hore; for <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> in the apprehen&s;ions of joy, for &s;eeing her &s;elf delivered from the inju|rious hands of the barbarous Captain, and being again in my protection; having taken a long &s;leep, &s;he feigned her &s;elf &s;o very much amen|ded, that rai&s;ing her &s;elf up in her bed, &s;he dar|red from her face a profu&s;ion of rayes of &s;ingu|lar beauty, as if &s;he had never had the lea&s;t in|di&s;po&s;ition, or trouble. And <HI>Alexander</HI> on the other &s;ide, perceived him&s;elf rea&s;onable well of his wounds; but I de&s;ired him before he &s;tir|red to expect the operation of the receipt, and with the woman's help prepared our repa&s;t, be|tween merry and &s;ad; merry, for the recovery of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> and hope of re&s;toring her pre&s;ent|ly to <HI>Arnaldo:</HI> &s;ad, for the death of <HI>Hercules,</HI> a Gentleman, for his worthy qualities, de&s;erving a longer life. This done, and having procured from the places adjacent, with much trouble, and large promi&s;es, two Fi&s;her-men, that un|dertook to carry us in that Schiff to <HI>Epidaurus;</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="81">whil&s;t we were making ready dinner, there came thither-ward a Judge in matters Criminall, with his Court, that were come from the City, up|on the information of the Pea&s;ants there abouts, to take cognizance of the pa&s;&s;ages the night be|fore, and to vi&s;it the dead bodyes, which &s;till lay in the field. This plea&s;ed not me a jot; for al|though right was on my &s;ide, yet having learnt, to my great co&s;t, what I might expect (though &s;ecured by my innocence,) among &s;uch kind of people; I took a re&s;olution not to imbroyl my &s;elf with them. Thereupon, making my hor&s;e to be brought into the Ve&s;&s;ell, and turning loo&s;e that of <HI>Hercules;</HI> I bid the Fi&s;her-men to put off from &s;hore, and to &s;teer towards the rock where <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> hinted we &s;hould find her &s;hipwrackt <HI>Arnaldo.</HI> The Fi&s;her-men would by no means obey, &s;aying, They were onely en|gaged to land us at <HI>Epidaurus:</HI> be&s;ides, there was no &s;ecurity to pa&s;&s;e with but two Oares, and &s;uch a burden, through the main Sea. When <HI>Alexander</HI> heard this, &s;tarting up from the place where he lay, and overcoming with his terrible|ne&s;&s;e my complacency, which would have ap|pea&s;ed them with intreaties and rewards, he threatened to kill them pre&s;ently, if they did not forthwith fall to their Oares. They &s;eeing &s;o trouble&s;ome a tempe&s;t to ari&s;e, turned their cour&s;e the way, that again&s;t their wills he made them &s;teer; but whether it were their villany or their ignorance, after that we had &s;pent the re|&s;idue of that day, in to&s;&s;ing to and fro in the Sea, about three hours within night, we arived at the rock, whence <HI>Arnaldo</HI> was departed &s;ix hours be|fore, for <HI>Epidaurus.</HI></P>
<PB N="141" REF="81">
<P>Meeting therefore with nothing but the frag|ments of the &s;plit Ve&s;&s;ell, and the chips made about the new Schiff, I was thereat exce&s;&s;ively vexed and confounded; not knowing which way to go to find <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> and deliver him his Spou&s;e; for as yet &s;he was not his Wife. But <HI>Alexander</HI> fell into &s;o great a fury, that if <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI> and I, had not put a &s;top to his fren&s;y, he would have thrown the Fi&s;her-men into the Sea, to who&s;e crime he attributed our tarriance. Be|ing unwilling therefore, to put to Sea in a new Voiage in the night, with &s;o unfaithfull guides, and in &s;o &s;mall a Boat, we acommodated our &s;elves the be&s;t we could in that place. And le&s;t that, whil&s;t we were a&s;leep, the Fi&s;hers &s;hould deceive us, we &s;o bound the Bark with chains, and cables to the &s;hore, that we were &s;ure it could not &s;tir thence, without our con&s;ent. But this prevention was to no purpo&s;e, for they expected when we &s;hould be a&s;leep, having learnt already, that in tho&s;e grotts there were hid &s;ome goods after the &s;hip wrack; and &s;oftly getting a &s;hore, they robb'd &s;ome che&s;ts, upon which they did &s;wim back to their own &s;hore. The fir&s;t that waked upon break of day, was <HI>Ar|go&s;thenia,</HI> and, without looking on any thing el&s;e, &s;he al&s;o landed about her own affairs, and there found &s;cattered on the ground, divers fardles of goods and writings, either faln by chance, or &s;lung there on purpo&s;e by the Fi&s;her-men, as being things that might impeach them. Where|upon, being a Lady of a vivacious and nimble ingenuity, &s;he gathered up the papers, and un|tying the bundles, found a box of Orientall
<PB N="144" REF="82">Turchoi&s;es, worth about two tho&s;and Ducats, and &s;ome five hundred Ducats in ready money. She laid them up in &s;afety, for her own u&s;e a|gain&s;t any misfortune that might happen, and &s;o returned into the Schiff. And by this time, the Day having a&s;&s;umed it's proper &s;plendour, &s;he was much troubled to mi&s;&s;e the Fi&s;her-men; &amp; in&s;tantly awaking me, &s;he &s;hewed me what &s;he had found, and adverti&s;ed me of their flight. But by rea&s;on I was unwilling to humour Fortune &s;o far, as to expre&s;&s;e any alteration at &s;o great an act of her Tyranny; I put a &s;mile upon the matter, and looking on the Stones, and re&s;toring them to the Lady, to di&s;po&s;e of them at her plea&s;ure; I had a curio&s;ity to turn over tho&s;e Papers. By the ru&s;ling whereof <HI>Alexander</HI> be|ing awakned, I with a &s;miling action, told him, Camrade: If fortune hath for &s;ome dayas con|fined us to this cliff, &s;he hath al&s;o provided us matter of entertainment. We have here bi&s;|ket, and wine; fle&s;h, and fi&s;h, for above a month: Wood we &s;hall not want; either for fuell, or to defend us, if need require, from the incommodity of the &s;ea&s;on, which was in the latter end of <HI>Autumn,</HI> towards the beginning of Winter. Courage yet, that, let the wor&s;t come that can, we &s;hall live even in this De&s;art.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> &s;miled, &amp; &s;aid; You have a brave time on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, Sir, &amp; you have good rea&s;on &s;o to e&s;teem it; for in the company of &s;o noble and virtuous a Lady, you might &s;tyle your &s;elf Happy, though reduced to greater hard&s;hips. But I, what &s;hall I do, in &s;o de&s;olate a place? Dear <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> &s;aid I you make too bad a con&s;truction of
<PB N="145" REF="82">my heart, &s;ince the &s;ervice I owe to this Lady, is the onely thing that troubleth me in this &s;oli|tude; not, but that I e&s;teem it a glory to be able to &s;erve her; but becau&s;e I cannot &s;ee her in &s;o much mi&s;ery without a &s;en&s;ible affliction, nor call to mind the Knight her Spou&s;e without ap|prehen&s;ive di&s;gu&s;ts. But the&s;e are onely words: the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e is, that we mu&s;t think upon our &s;afety. Here we cannot hold our &s;elves &s;ecure; for &s;hips never &s;ayl this way, except that of our unfortunate friends: and were it &s;o, that &s;ome &s;hould by chance come, we &s;hould be &s;till un|certain of our lives. To think to get to land of our &s;elves, having never in all our lives touched Oars, or Sayls, would be a piece of &s;olemn folly. I have already computed that we have provi&s;ion to &s;erve us for five, or &s;ix weeks. This confi|dered, let us di&s;po&s;e our &s;elves to pa&s;&s;e away the time, &s;ince it cannot be with much joy, yet with the lea&s;t annoy that prudence will permit; and accu&s;tom our &s;elves every day to manage the&s;e <HI>Maritime Pennes,</HI> that we may learn upon this great <HI>Book</HI> of the water to <HI>Write</HI> our &s;elves an im|mortal name. Sir, &s;aid <HI>Alexander</HI> command what you plea&s;e, for I will make you free and ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of my will.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded of things, my fir&s;t thought was to make a Coffin, to bury there the body of <HI>Hercules;</HI> and there was no great diffi|culty in it, for there was reliques of Wood, Iron, and Pitch, &s;ufficient to have rai&s;ed an ample &s;tru|cture. This done, and leaving the old woman to dre&s;&s;e Dinner, and look to my hor&s;e, we walked till Dinner time to view the Rock; and <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="83">making a Bow of green wood, and &s;ome ru&s;tick Arrows of drie &s;plinters, found her &s;elf an excellent diverti&s;ement, by &s;hooting &s;uch Birds as flew thither, from the adjoyning conti|nent. Having dined, we &s;pent the re&s;t of that day, part in merriment, and part in rai&s;ing a Cab|bin to lye in a-nights. The day following we &s;pent al&s;o in tho&s;e, and &s;uch like other new re|creations, having learn't of the woman how to angle with the hook and line; who was therein mo&s;t dextrous. On the &s;ixth day of this our <HI>Hermetical</HI> cour&s;e of life, about noon we di&s;|covered a Fly-boat making towards us; where|upon drawing our Bark a&s;hore, we fortified our &s;elves &s;o, that we could have defended our &s;elves with ea&s;e, from a greater number in that Moun|tainous and impenetrable Fort; e&s;pecially with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> who being perfect in Archery, could have &s;ent death at a good di|&s;tance to our Enemies.</P>
<P>They of the &s;hip perceiving our de&s;ign, put forth a white flag in token of peace and friend|&s;hip; <HI>Alexander,</HI> for all this, as being alwayes a Lover of blows and quarrels, would not agree that we &s;hould tru&s;t them to approach us; but <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> having di&s;covered among&s;t them the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip-wrack't Ve&s;&s;el, &s;he took occa|&s;ion to treat him courteou&s;ly to get &s;ome news of <HI>Arnaldo:</HI> We made therefore to under&s;tand at a good di&s;tance, that we intended to let none land but onely him&s;elf and one companion. He readily accorded to our plea&s;ure, being the Com|mander of all the re&s;t; but coming on &s;hoar, he &s;tood like one half dead to &s;ee <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> with
<PB N="147" REF="83">a countenance more re&s;embling a Godde&s;&s;e then a Mortal; and, but that he &s;aw her ravi&s;hed, and carried away with his own eyes, he would have &s;worn &s;he had never &s;tirr'd thence. The fir&s;t word we asked him was, What was become of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> and he told us, that having learnt by the Proce&s;&s;e formed by the Criminal Court, the death of the Captain her Ravi&s;her, and that &s;he was put to Sea for &s;ome other place with two young Cavaliers in her Company; whereas be|fore he was comforted with the death of that Traitor, he now received a greater affliction in this new &s;eparation; having a conceit that one of tho&s;e young Gentlemen was the &s;ame Knight who, &s;aid he, was de&s;tinated by heaven, perpetual|ly to oblige him, &s;o that he could never live in quiet within him&s;elf for him; having therefore now three dayes &s;ince departed towards <HI>Corinth,</HI> in hope to find him there together with his Spou&s;e. But three dayes after his departure, he the &s;aid <HI>Methrodorus</HI> had heard &s;ome rumour, that we were upon that Rock; for two Fi&s;her|men of tho&s;e Coa&s;ts being accu&s;ed of having &s;old goods that were prohibited, and being ap|prehended by Ju&s;tice, and having confe&s;t again&s;t them&s;elves, where they had done that robbery, they were likewi&s;e accu&s;ed of their errour in a|bandoning us in that manner. And that he was come thither to fetch away the re&s;idue of the goods hid in tho&s;e caves, and to &s;ee withall if he might meet with the happine&s;&s;e of being able in any mea&s;ure to &s;erve us. I knew what con&s;tru|ction <HI>Arnaldo</HI>'s turbulent nature would put up|on my actions, but I re&s;erved my thoughts to
<PB N="148" REF="84">my &s;elf, thanking <HI>Methrodorus</HI> for his courte&s;ie, and &s;aying, that we would onely trouble him once more &s;o far as to borrow &s;ome of his Mar|riners to go as far as <HI>Argos,</HI> or <HI>Corinth;</HI> for that we intended to go thither in &s;earch of <HI>Arnal|do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Methrodorus</HI> pre&s;ently made a voluntary offer to wait upon us him&s;elf to that Port with two of his Marriners, which attended him in that Fly|boat. Then <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> with a Soul truely ge|nerous took him a&s;ide, and &s;hewed him what &s;he had found in Money and Jewels, asking him, If they were his. He an&s;wered, they were; but that he pre&s;ented her with them: and becau&s;e &s;he &s;hould not think that he was &s;o liberal of things that were lo&s;t, giving her that which was not in his power, he took his other riches out of the Cave, and made her an exceeding noble Pre&s;ent of Cloaths, both Silk and Gold, of Oriental work|man&s;hip very beautifull and co&s;tly. Then la|ding his Bark, he kept with him&s;elf onely &s;ome of the preciou&s;e&s;t things, and he &s;ent her under conduct of his Mate towards <HI>Athens,</HI> whither he before was bound, that he might &s;tay him&s;elf with us to guide his Skiffe.</P>
<P>Then I complemented <HI>Alexander,</HI> entreating him to acquaint me with his intention, for I thought it not civil longer to impede his return into his Countrey. But he being offended by my Courte&s;ie, &s;aid, He knew not in honour how to de&s;ert us, till he &s;aw us in a place of &s;ecurity. So we both mounted the Skiff, which was excel|lent well provided for all occurrences, &s;teering with a pro&s;perous wind towards <HI>Corinth;</HI> and
<PB N="149" REF="84">coming to fall upon a di&s;cour&s;e about the wri|tings found by <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> we came to know, that <HI>Methrodorus</HI> was not what he appeared to be, a Ma&s;ter of a <HI>Cretan</HI> &s;hip, but a Knight of <HI>Calcides,</HI> father of <HI>Cali&s;thenes,</HI> formerly &s;poken of as the Lover of <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> treacherou&s;ly &s;lain by her brother <HI>Ari&s;theus</HI> in <HI>Athens.</HI> Whereupon the in|&s;urrections of <HI>Calcides</HI> en&s;uing, which had almo&s;t put the whole I&s;le into a revolt, he was forced to depart thence with the confi&s;cation of his goods, and went to <HI>Candia,</HI> where he built the &s;hip that was ca&s;t away, and had &s;o good &s;ucce&s;&s;e in the management of that imployment, that he was at that pre&s;ent worth little le&s;&s;e then twenty thou&s;and Ducats, which he had in <HI>A|thens. Argo&s;thenia</HI> wept exceedingly at the do|lorous remembrance of her betrayed <HI>Cali&s;thenes;</HI> nor was <HI>Methrodorus</HI> le&s;&s;e moved when knowing her for the innocent cau&s;e of all his lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes, he under&s;tood, moreover, that &s;he was already contracted to <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> a Knight of the bloud Royal of <HI>Thebes;</HI> and might one day a&s;cend the Throne of <HI>Negropont.</HI> He re&s;pected her therefore thence-forward as his Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, and he entreated her, that at her return to her own Countrey, whither he offered to carry her, &s;he would plea&s;e to think upon his ruined family, and re&s;tore it by &s;ome act of bene|ficence. <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> promi&s;ed that when it &s;hould be in her power &s;he would remember him, not &s;o much for being the father of <HI>Cali|&s;thenes,</HI> and injuriou&s;ly per&s;ecuted, as for the Courte&s;ies &s;hewn her in that her nece&s;sity.

<P>THe &s;en&s;e of friend&s;hip rendred this depriva|tion of <HI>Alexander,</HI> inconceivably grievous; but Prudence le&s;&s;ened my affliction, thinking
<PB N="152" REF="86">that he had cho&s;en the better part, and I began to de&s;ire, to vi&s;ite my &s;elf one day, the De&s;arts of <HI>Marmarica.</HI> I imparted this pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Argo|&s;thenia,</HI> and <HI>Methrodorus;</HI> and they &s;eemed ra|ther to blame, than commend it. <Q>And <HI>Argo|&s;thenia</HI> &s;aid, that, Cavaliers of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s quality, born into the World for the profit of Mortalls, ought not to deprive them&s;elves of the means to employ tho&s;e Talents, to the common benefit, which Heaven had lent them, for this very end, to &s;erve to mankind in ge|nerall: I defended the re&s;olution of my friend, alledging, that all tho&s;e who had obtained from Heaven the rare qualities of Wit and Valour, were not obliged to employ them to the benefits of others, with a manife&s;t perill to them&s;elves. For, Heaven is al&s;o wont, to de|prive men of the favours conceded them, as a puni&s;hment of their ingratitude and unwor|thine&s;&s;e, &s;eeing Virtue is for the mo&s;t part rather per&s;ecuted than acknowledged. Again, the re|&s;olution of <HI>Alexander</HI> well con&s;idered, his re|tiredne&s;&s;e, may prove to the World a greater benefit than his commerce with men, whil&s;t that, in conver&s;ation, by rea&s;on of his capric|cio's and adole&s;centiall vanities, he was inju|rious and prejudiciall to many, and in &s;eque|&s;trative &s;olitarine&s;&s;e, he may be able with this integrity of his life and conver&s;ation, to come forth for an univer&s;all benefit into the World.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, &s;aid <HI>Methrodorus,</HI> Who knows, but that even this re&s;olution may ari&s;e from a fan|ta&s;ticall humour, and not from the invitation
<PB N="153" REF="86">of Heaven? It concerns not us, replyed I, to penetrate into the&s;e &s;ecrets; in the mean time, we know, that Heaven &s;ometimes makes u&s;e of &s;uch like means, to extract a generous Virtue out of a con&s;trained nece&s;&s;ity. We ought al|wayes to cen&s;ure well of tho&s;e things, which ever appear good in them&s;elves. For although the iniquity of man convert the&s;e into the wor&s;t, yet it doth not follow, that the <HI>good</HI> is not &s;till <HI>good</HI> in it &s;elf; although the perver&s;ity of &s;ome, do &s;ini&s;terly u&s;e it. Certainly <HI>Alexander</HI> hath done well, to prefer his own &s;afety to others benefit, for &s;o exerci&s;ing his proper goodne&s;&s;e, he &s;hall live without injury, yea, rather with commodity to others: whereas in a Knightly life, although he might have pro|fited &s;ome, that could hardly ever be without the prejudice of many. For although he me|rited &s;ometimes in defence of Innocence, and in cha&s;ti&s;ment of Villany; yet it more fre|quently came to pa&s;&s;e, that he undid him&s;elf and others, in a vanity, in a humour, or in a complement.</Q></P>
<P>Thus I argued: but I &s;aw that this <HI>Philo&s;o|phy</HI> little liked <HI>Methrodorus,</HI> immerg'd in the thoughts of recovering his Hou&s;e from the dy&s;|a&s;ters, occa&s;ioned by the Loves of <HI>Cali&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Argo&s;thenia;</HI> and <HI>it</HI> did as much di&s;plea&s;e <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> fearing that I al&s;o intended to de|&s;ert her, to follow the track of <HI>Alexander:</HI> and therefore I changed di&s;cour&s;e, de&s;iring <HI>Methro|dorus</HI> to advi&s;e us, concerning the manner of our Voyage; for that being as yet uncerrain of find|ing <HI>Arnaldo</HI> at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and being loth to di|&s;turb
<PB N="154" REF="87"><HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> with a journey by Land, I judged &s;he might tran&s;port her &s;elf commodi|ou&s;ly by Sea to <HI>Athens,</HI> and &s;tay there in a hou&s;e which I kept there till &s;uch time as I had over|taken <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> which by making long journies over land I might &s;oon do.</P>
<P><HI>Methrodorus</HI> was plea&s;ed with my de&s;ign, but <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> would not agree to it, fearing &s;till that I contrived pretexts to abandon her. But having promi&s;ed, (whether I found <HI>Arnaldo</HI> or no) to be at <HI>Athens,</HI> within the &s;pace of fifteen dayes, to wait upon her, &s;he conde&s;cended, though in my judgment it was &s;till very unwil|lingly.</P>
<P>This being re&s;olved on, we proceeded to act it; <HI>Methrodorus</HI> hiring a Bark, and putting out in&s;tantly to Sea; and I began at the &s;ame in&s;tant, by Land, my journy towards <HI>Corinth.</HI> And ju&s;t as I entred the hou&s;e of <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> I met full of &s;orrow and &s;adne&s;&s;e the fair <HI>Or&s;ina;</HI> and after many throbs and &s;ighs, &s;he related to me, that the <HI>Injur'd Lover</HI> had been at that City to en|quire of me and <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> and <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> had entertained him at his hou&s;e, where hearing how much I took to heart his dy&s;a&s;ters, and what di|ligence I had u&s;ed to learn his captivity, to &s;et him at liberty, it partly mitigated, if not who|ly depo&s;ed the maligne &s;u&s;pitions of his Jelou|&s;y, that held him in a continuall torment, to at|tend a while among tho&s;e, to whom I was conti|nually writing &s;ome thing or other of news, concerning me. But &s;eeing that, contrary to my cu&s;tom, I had now let pa&s;&s;e ten dayes, without writing to them, or &s;ending any me&s;&s;age, he
<PB N="155" REF="87">went thence that day, upon a certain rumour, that, &s;ayling towards the I&s;land of <HI>Aegina,</HI> I was ca&s;t away with a Knight and a Lady in my com|pany; and fell into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, that incon|tinently leaving <HI>Corinth,</HI> he &s;wore he would not &s;urvive the death of his unfortunate Spou&s;e.

Under&s;tanding this, and being glutted and &s;ated with &s;o many ri|gours and errours of Fortune and Love, I com|forted <HI>Or&s;ina</HI> the be&s;t I could, in &s;uch an inter|venience of affairs; yet &s;he would not let me depart (at lea&s;t, till <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> his return;) but becau&s;e I would not fail in my word to <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> nor omit any thing on my part, to &s;atisfy my debt of Amity with <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> I pre|&s;ently left that City, and having gone about &s;ix miles, I was thinking to turn my cour&s;e towards the Province of <HI>Megara,</HI> when, behold, I &s;aw a Currier and his guide, coming full &s;peed down a hill before me, to whom I advanced, and de|manded, From whence he came po&s;ting with &s;o much ha&s;t.

</LETTER>
<P>BUt the Letter to <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> was onely full of feminine tenderne&s;&s;e, condoling, and congratulating, with referring her in the con|clu&s;ion, to what &s;he had writ to <HI>Arnaldo</HI> and <HI>Philiternus,</HI> as to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of her return to that hou&s;e, which was now doubly hers. This news, though it came not to me altogether un|expected, yet I was thereat greatly perplexed, for it bereft me of my re&s;t, and greatly troubled
<PB N="159" REF="89">me; in which I was con&s;trained to Combat more with dome&s;tick than forrain Enemies; for it &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ible to me that the fraternal con|fidence <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> had in me, &s;hould not al|wayes retain a continual apprehen&s;ion of &s;u&s;pi|tion the ever jealous, and ever amorous &s;pirit of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> threatning to break out one day into &s;ome great di&s;order; as al&s;o on the other &s;ide loving that gentle Cavalier with a mo&s;t cordial affection, and being by him truely rebeloved: for I knew very well that to &s;uch &s;u&s;picious &s;pirits even the <HI>Atomes</HI> in the Aire are wont to occa|&s;ion trouble and inquietude. Yet I forbore this thought for that time, and di&s;mi&s;t the guide that accompanied this me&s;&s;enger, taking him with me towards the Citie of <HI>Eulixis,</HI> where I held &s;ome intere&s;t and corre&s;pondence, gathering of him as I went, perfect information of the news of <HI>Boeotia</HI> and <HI>Negropont.</HI> Being come to <HI>Eleuxis,</HI> I was encountred with a &s;trange accident of <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> being condemned to death, and <HI>Arnaldo</HI>'s being a pri&s;oner with that Governour.</P>
<P><HI>Furi&s;thus</HI> having gone to <HI>Egina,</HI> and finding no intelligence of what he de&s;ired about my per&s;on, he was per&s;waded by an <HI>Eleuxin</HI> Lady, that had means lay in that I&s;le, to &s;erve her with his <HI>Fe|luca</HI> to <HI>Eleuxis; Euri&s;thus</HI> knew nothing how that &s;he was confined thither by the Governour, upon occa&s;ion of her husbands being &s;lain by one of her Lovers. He came therefore with all &s;ecurity by midnight (the very time elected by <HI>Liviana,</HI> that &s;he might not be known) to the Citie, where walking freely up and down, he ca&s;ually met <HI>Arnaldo</HI> the next morning, as he
<PB N="160" REF="90">was ju&s;t departing for <HI>Athens,</HI> in the &s;ame de|&s;perate condition as we have &s;aid, for the pre|&s;umed &s;hipwrack of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> and <HI>Philiternus.</HI> He walked with &s;uch di&s;traction and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that although he met <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> he &s;o little regarded him that he did not know him. But <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> awaking him by his civility out of that profound trance, and imparting to him &s;omething of what Fame muttered in our pre|judice, he invited him to &s;tay awhile in the hou&s;e of that Lady, with an intention of wait|ing upon him with his <HI>Feluca</HI> to <HI>Athens,</HI> whi|ther he de&s;igned to go the better to inform him|&s;elf of my proceedings in my own hou&s;e. The Lady made great entertainment for the Knight, and perceiving him to be notwith&s;tanding his trouble and melancholly (that had &s;o injur'd him) the goodlie&s;t per&s;on in the World, in a flou|ri&s;hing age of twenty five years, and again ha|ving dedicated her &s;elf to &s;en&s;uality, &s;he took a conceit to allay her di&s;&s;olutene&s;&s;e in this her fa|miliarity. She invited him therefore to Dinner; <HI>an occa&s;ion, proper, by the intervention of</HI> Bacchus, <HI>to introduce the intere&s;ts of</HI> Venus; and began with her procacious glances, and ge&s;tures, and licentious and la&s;civious words, to in&s;til into the mind of the Cavalier the incentives of her lu&s;t. <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> who had alwayes loved more like a contemplative <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> then a carnal <HI>Amori&s;t,</HI> not yet knowing what the malice of women was, &s;miled to him&s;elf at &s;uch pretentions, and pre|&s;erving in his external actions a mode&s;t affabili|ty, he with a marvellous &s;weetne&s;&s;e deluded her. The woman hereat not a jot di&s;couraged, or de|terr'd
<PB N="161" REF="90">from giving her de&s;igns a birth by the Mid|wifry of &s;ome better machinations, prevailed &s;o far, with the help of <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> that &s;he got the Knight to &s;tay there a night longer. Which come, &s;he depo&s;ed all feminine mode&s;ty, and went to find him in his own bed, to throw her &s;elf naked into his embraces. But not being en|tertained, but rather di&s;dain'd by the generous <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> which would con&s;erve the faith of Ma|trimony immaculate to his &s;pou&s;e; &s;he was mov'd with &s;uch &s;corn, that, like a di&s;&s;olute woman, &s;he converted her la&s;civious de&s;ire into inveterate hatred, contriving for revenge of her repul&s;e, the &s;trange&s;t villany that could po&s;&s;ibly enter into the heart of woman. She made it be &s;ignified to the Governour, that when he had revok't her bani&s;hment, &s;he would put into his power her husband's murtherer.</P>
<P>The Governour accepted the offer, de&s;iring to get that Traytor into his hands; and &s;he de|tained <HI>Arnaldo</HI> with &s;undry inventions, hiding his hor&s;e's furniture in her hou&s;e: but yet at la&s;t being offended with &s;uch entertainment, &amp; pre|paring to be gone, the Provo&s;t of the Citie at the &s;ame in&s;tant broke into the hou&s;e with the great|e&s;t fury in the World with all his Officers, and be&s;et the Knight to carry him to pri&s;on: Gene|rous <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> &s;eeing this, put him&s;elf upon a daring, but imprudent Enterprize; bearing away no prize of honour by contracting with &s;uch a rout of Catch-poles, from whom onely to fly was honourable; and ran his &s;word through the brea&s;t of the Provo&s;t with &s;uch a re&s;olution that he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;e at his feer. But all this audaci|ty
<PB N="162" REF="91">could not prevent <HI>Arnaldo</HI> from going to pri&s;on: and he him&s;elf was al&s;o &s;tay'd and car|ried by force to the Magi&s;trates: To whom the fact being atte&s;ted, they condemned him, as guil|ty of Trea&s;on in the per&s;on of a publick Officer, to lo&s;e his head upon a Scaffold.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things I arrived in <HI>Eleuxis,</HI> and under&s;tanding the pa&s;&s;ages by a Gentleman my friend, at who&s;e hou&s;e I had lay'n; without ta|king great thought for <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> knowing a&s;&s;ured|ly that the <HI>Injur'd Lover</HI> could not be guilty of &s;uch a Crime: I was extreamly &s;urprized, and confu&s;ed at the name of <HI>Euri&s;thus;</HI> becau&s;e my friend repre&s;enting his ca&s;e to me as of a very comely, and couragious young man, I imme|diatly &s;u&s;pected him to be my dear <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> husband to <HI>Or&s;ina.</HI> I rid therefore &s;traight to the Palace, where the young man was prepa|ring him&s;elf to his la&s;t departure, and at my re|que&s;t, I was permitted to &s;ee him: but I was &s;o tran&s;ported, that I was nearer death then he, finding him in &s;o wretched a condition, upon which the la&s;t minutes of his life depended. On the other &s;ide, <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> rejoyced to &s;ee me, and was beyond mea&s;ure a&s;hamed, that I &s;hould find him in that condition &s;o unworthy of his gene|ro&s;ity: Yet having not lo&s;t the brisk &s;pirit which was &s;o natural to him, I apprehended the qua|lity of his Crime, and that of a certain the <HI>In|jur'd Lover</HI> was the impri&s;oned Knight, with the pre&s;umptive &s;tain of the murtherer of <HI>Liviana</HI>'s husband. I ran in all ha&s;te with <HI>Euridamas,</HI> the Cavalier my friend, to the Governour, to whom having di&s;clo&s;ed the quality of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> I in|treated
<PB N="163" REF="91">him al&s;o to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the &s;entence of <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> for having done this in the company of a Knight of &s;o high birth, and inno|cence, his own reputation would &s;uffer, both in the impri&s;onment, and death of his Cam|rade.</P>
<P>The Governour remained exceedingly &s;u&s;|pended at the di&s;covery of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> nor would he (at lea&s;t as he fained) give credit to my te|&s;timony; whereupon that I might not lo&s;e a minute of time to <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI>'s prejudice, I &s;hewed the Letters ju&s;t before received from <HI>Olympia,</HI> and produced the Currier him&s;elf that brought them me, plainly to prove the truth of my depo&s;itions. And here aro&s;e a new mountain of difficulty, for the Governour (having begun to fear, le&s;t <HI>Arnaldo</HI> once got out of pri&s;on, and gone to <HI>Boeotia,</HI> might plot &s;ome revenge for that injury) would not &s;et him at liberty till he had fir&s;t acquainted the Senate of <HI>Athens</HI> with the&s;e proceedings. I perceiving this fear of the Go|vernour, took upon me, (having &s;omething to lo&s;e in the Dominion of <HI>Attica</HI>) to a&s;&s;ure him of the per&s;on of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> for that all the pu|ni&s;hment of his affronts falling upon his fal&s;e accu&s;ers; he could not with any rea&s;on be a|grieved with the publick ju&s;tice. This difficul|ty being overcome, I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity pre&s;&s;e yet a little farther, to defer al&s;o the &s;entence of <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> for the getting him out of all danger was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible without a miracle. But &s;eeing my prayers and remon&s;trances profited little, I ran to the Governour's wife, a comely and di&s;creet Lady, with the whom I had &s;ome
<PB N="164" REF="92">years before pa&s;t &s;ome &s;ervices in <HI>Athens;</HI> and &s;o importunatly intreated her, that &s;he inter|po&s;ed her own authority with her husband, and obtained three dayes time of re&s;pit for his re|prieve; for &s;o much &s;erved for my de&s;ign; which was to get an order (though there was no need) from the Supream Magi&s;trates of <HI>Athens</HI> to in|hibit all proceedings in that cau&s;e, and to ad|journ the judging of it to the &s;ame Tribunal. Which done, and <HI>Euri&s;thus</HI> being returned to pri&s;on, I went with the Judge Criminal to the pri&s;on of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> where the Cavalier being ex|amined upon my depo&s;itions, and &s;ound inno|cent; the Governour commanded that he &s;hould be entertained in the Palace, de&s;iring at his wife's in&s;tigation to &s;atisfie with courteous treatment, that over-&s;ight of a con&s;trained im|prudence towards him.</P>

<P><HI>I&s;abella</HI> was &s;ilent, and I rejoyn'd; Madam, It was only a novelty that fame &s;pread abroad by an Ignorant Amouri&s;t, that breaking open the &s;eals of &s;ome Lettes which he under&s;tood not, interpreted them according to his ignorance, and publi&s;hed them conformable to his mal|lice.

I &s;igh'd, and &s;he fell on weeping at that encounter: and I extreamly de&s;ired to know, what cro&s;&s;e wind of Fortune had di&s;turb|ed the tranquillity of her &s;tate: But becau&s;e that was not a time for &s;uch matters, I &s;udden|ly had a conceit, how I might &s;ave <HI>Euri&s;thus,</HI> by her means. I therefore intreated <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to
<PB N="168" REF="94">grant her me for two hours, before her depar|ture, and I obtained her without reply: <HI>Arnal|do,</HI> and I, were invited to dinner by the Gover|nour; <HI>I&s;abella</HI> exempting her &s;elf, that &s;he might make ready all things for her departure, and to take care about what we had agreed upon, for the &s;afety of <HI>Euri&s;thus.</HI> Here it was, we under|&s;tood by publick information, that the Count of <HI>Lithar,</HI> uniting the Army of the Rebells, was gone to lay &s;eige to <HI>Cari&s;tum,</HI> to beleaguer the Dutche&s;&s;e therein, and that &s;he had for that cau&s;e di&s;patch't one of her Gentlemen to <HI>Athens,</HI> to demand a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Republick, where|upon the Generall at Sea was commanded to &s;et &s;ail for that place forthwith: we took a re|&s;olution, not to lo&s;e that opportunity of &s;er|ving <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> by tran&s;porting our &s;elves in the &s;ame Armado to <HI>Negropont.</HI> And in the interim he had an opportunity of &s;ending to <HI>Boeotia, Olym|pia</HI>'s me&s;&s;enger, with advice of his re&s;olutions, and to petition the King, to let his &s;uccours on the other hand march to that I&s;le.

Yet for the pre|&s;ent, know that <HI>Antonello</HI> is dead, becau&s;e he was not worthy of the company of &s;o hand&s;ome a maid. He was become &s;o infinitely Jealous of her, that &s;he could not &s;tir out of doors, to go to the Temple, nor &s;o much as &s;ee the air at her window, without his grumbling, and bea|ting her. You know what is wont to happen to &s;uch Animals; but the goodne&s;&s;e of <HI>Li&s;a,</HI> hath never de&s;ired (though &s;he might) to pay him in the Coyn he de&s;erved: howbeit not be|ing able to live in &s;o mi&s;erable a &s;lavery, &s;he found out a way to free her &s;elf by placing her|&s;elf in the Palace neer my per&s;on. Whereat <HI>Antonello</HI> took &s;uch di&s;ta&s;t, and fell into &s;o fu|rious a rage, that meeting me one day at a fea&s;t, he had the &s;aucine&s;&s;e, to vent his re&s;entments publickly treating me with unworthy names. Whereby tho&s;e Cavaliers, at who&s;e hou&s;e the fea&s;t was celebrated, were &s;o moved, that un|der pretence of communicating &s;omething to him, they drew him a&s;ide and &s;lew him, having learnt, by his death, all &s;uch ra&s;h fellows, to ob|&s;erve the re&s;pect due to Ladies of my quality. In &s;um, <HI>Antonello</HI> is dead, and <HI>Li&s;a</HI> lives ever at your di&s;po&s;e; I having no longer any de&s;ire of this charge, to keep her for you. Di&s;po&s;e of her therefore at your plea&s;ure, &s;he being yours; but look well to it, that you provide her no
<PB N="172" REF="96">more Jealous husbands, for I know not whe|ther &s;he may be alwayes &s;o good as not to deal with them according to their de&s;erts. The re&s;t of the company laughed, but <HI>Arnaldo</HI> &s;ighed at the&s;e words of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> though it was onely ob&s;erved by my &s;elf, that &s;ate next him, and knew the peccant humour of his profound me|lancholly. He asked me, Who that fair young creature was? And I &s;atisfied him, that being a Noble Lady of <HI>Anapli&s;tum,</HI> which fell, by the death of her Parents, into a mi&s;erable conditi|on, I had took her into my hou&s;e, and marryed her to a young man, well de&s;cended, of <HI>Eleuxis,</HI> who peri&s;hed in the mi&s;-fortune re-counted by <HI>I&s;abella:</HI> whereupon, he expre&s;t a de&s;ire to have her go along with <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> that &s;o he might repay to her part of the obligations, which he acknowledged to my per&s;on. Perceiving where|at he did drive, I complyed with him, &s;eeing that together with freeing him, in a great mea&s;ure, from the inquietude of his jealou&s;ie, I came al&s;o to ea&s;e my &s;elf of the burden of farther caring for her. An&s;wering, that he was her Ma&s;ter, alwayes provided that &s;he was &s;atisfied; becau&s;e I was alwayes far from offering Vio|lence to the liberty of another's will. In this kind of entertainment we came with a feli|citous voyage to <HI>Athens;</HI> where Fortune had prepared for us a new vexation. After we had waited upon <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to her hou&s;e, we took our way towards my own; where in&s;tead of <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> and <HI>Methrodorus,</HI> we came to en|counter with the perfidious <HI>Liviana,</HI> who, without knowing who I was, had landed there

She having re-a&s;&s;um'd her bani&s;hed &s;pirits from her &s;udden fright, betook her|&s;elf to my Clo&s;et, and ha&s;tily &s;hutting her|&s;elf in, fell a plotting her own death, to free her&s;elf from the feared ignominy of &s;ome &s;can|dalous puni&s;hment.

</LETTER>
<P>HAving written this Letter, and informed <HI>Euridamas</HI> of my thoughts, I &s;ent him to pre&s;ent it to the Counte&s;&s;e, together with a Necklace of Turchoi&s;es, wrought in Gold, com|po&s;ed by <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> in her idlene&s;&s;e at <HI>Athens.</HI> The quality of the pre&s;ent, more than the &s;tyle of my Letter, and the curio&s;ity together of &s;ee|ing my pre&s;umed wife, which <HI>Euridamas</HI> com|mended for the mo&s;t beautifull Creature in the World, ea&s;ily per&s;waded the Counte&s;&s;e to grant me more than my reque&s;t, making us an offer of her own Palace, till &s;uch time as we were provided with Lodgings. But being unwilling to engage my &s;elf, I took the fir&s;t empty hou&s;e, which I &s;tumbled upon, and &s;hut my &s;elf up in it, and that night went with <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> to the Palace; not only to complement with the Count and Counte&s;&s;e, but to ob&s;erve their proceedings, and the manner and quality of their Attendants. The Care&s;&s;es which the Counte&s;&s;e gave us, (de|&s;iring perhaps to get &s;ome other pre&s;ent out of us), were indeed without mea&s;ure, and yet with|out
<PB N="180" REF="100">the lea&s;t affectation, for that &s;he was a Lady truely &s;prightly, vivacious, and magnanimous. This foundation being laid, and having for ever captivated the heart of the Counte&s;&s;e to favour us; I adverti&s;ed <HI>Methrodorus</HI> that he &s;hould be|gin by little and little to di&s;cover him&s;elf to his Kindred, Friends, and Allies, which he knew di&s;|gu&s;ted the pre&s;ent Government; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> declaring he was arrived at <HI>Calcides,</HI> upon a&s;&s;urance of the fall of the Royal family which had &s;o per&s;ecu|ted them. With this diligence we collected in a few dayes twelve Cavaliers of the Prime of the Nobility of <HI>Negropont:</HI> &s;ome of which, though di&s;&s;atisfied with the Dutche&s;&s;e and the Princes pa&s;t; yet would not admit to be governed by per&s;ons whom they had conver&s;ed with as equals in Fortune, and whom they had treated as in|feriours in Nobility. We could ea&s;ily have mu&s;tered a far greater number; but fearing by delay to give fortune an occa&s;ion of di&s;covering &s;omething of the&s;e agitations; and doubting that in a greater number &s;uch a &s;ecret might be endangered; we &s;ummoned them every one to meet at an hour unob&s;erved in my hou&s;e; and having taken of them a &s;olemne Oath towards the Dutche&s;&s;e their legitimate Lady, for who&s;e &s;ervice I had gathered them together in that a&s;|&s;embly, I began in this manner re&s;olutely to &s;peak.</P>
<P><Q>My Lords, I &s;uppo&s;e that you have alrea|dy under&s;tood by <HI>Methrodorus</HI> your good Friend and Kin&s;man, to what end you were called hither, which is to con&s;ult of the way to eject the Rebels, and Tyrants from this Ci|tie,
<PB N="181" REF="100">and to put it into the hands of the Dutche&s;&s;e <HI>Doricinia,</HI> to whom by right of pri|mogeniture, and by your election, you be ob|liged in a perpetual obedience and fidelity. I know you think it &s;trange, that I, being a young man, and a &s;tranger, &s;hould upon my own motion venture my &s;elf, and incite you to an Enterprize of &s;o much difficulty, and dan|ger; But I &s;hall not be the fir&s;t among men, which although a weak in&s;trument my &s;elf, have been able to give a motion to grand ma|chinations. But, though others moved by co|vetou&s;ne&s;&s;e, have attempted enterprizes above their fortune; I may be thought to be come to this re&s;olution by the onely impul&s;e of Ju&s;tice, Friend&s;hip, and Love. She, My Lords, which here you behold with the name of <HI>Erintha,</HI> and in the appearance of my wife, is <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> a noble branch of the Royal Stem of your Prin|ces, to whom, after the Dutche&s;&s;e your Mi&s;tre&s;s, di&s;cends the inheritance of this mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Principality. Nor is &s;he my wife, but my Lady by merit, and Si&s;ter by fortune: and is indeed lawfull Spou&s;e of <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> a noble per&s;on of the Royal Line of <HI>Thebes,</HI> which is ready to come in a few hours with the Armado of the Republick of <HI>Athens</HI> in relief of the Dutch|e&s;&s;e. There will not be wanting neither, on the other &s;ide, the &s;uccours of the <HI>Theban</HI> King, who &s;tayes but for our notice, to ha&s;te over with his Forces to the&s;e parts. But if it be lawfull for me freely to declare my thoughts; I do not at all like the&s;e Auxiliaries, becau&s;e I am afraid it is but the taking a Serpent into our bo|&s;ome,
<PB N="182" REF="101">to our &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, rather than relief. For, if that Commonwealth, and this King, make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the &s;tronge&s;t pla|ces of this Dukedom, to which they have &s;o antient and &s;o &s;trong preten&s;ions; I know not when they will be content to re&s;ign them willingly; (<HI>Princes never wanting pretexts, to u&s;urp, and detain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of other States;)</HI> And, to compell them by force, we &s;hall be al|wayes too weak of our &s;elves; and to call other Princes to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would be an opening the &s;luces to our totall inundati|on, changing this Country into a &s;eat of con|tinuall War, for &s;trangers, to con&s;ume our wealth, annihilate our families, violate our honours, and to impo&s;e reduplicated chains of va&s;&s;allage, upon this, at yet, free Principali|ty. I would advi&s;e therefore, that with Spi|rits, and Re&s;olutions, worthy of generous Knights, and Loyall Subjects, we do at|tempt with our own hands, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Crown of this Dominion, upon the heads of our legitimate Princes and Ma&s;ters. Nor is this &s;o difficult a matter to effect, if it be well managed. Re&s;olve therefore to acknowledge for your Prince&s;&s;e (with a <HI>Salvo</HI> alwayes to the right of the Dutche&s;&s;e our Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e) <HI>Ar|go&s;t henia,</HI> and to unite your &s;elves for her, in this te&s;timony of fidelity; and hereafter, we &s;hall not want either time or occa&s;ion to con|&s;ult the manner al&s;o of turning the Rebells out of the City, to e&s;tabli&s;h her in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her lawfull Dominions.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Cavaliers for a good &s;pace &s;tood a&s;to|ni&s;hed,
<PB N="183" REF="101">by the unexpected coming of <HI>Argo&s;the|nia,</HI> and by &s;uch an attempt of a young Knight, alone, and &s;urrounded by a City of Enemies. But afterwards certified by <HI>Methrodorus,</HI> and by their own eyes (which di&s;cerned in the face of <HI>ArgO&s;thenia,</HI> the features of <HI>Doricinia,</HI> and her decea&s;ed brothers) of the truth of her per|&s;on; and encouraged al&s;o by the reher&s;all of the adventures &s;he had happily gone through, un|der my conduct, and of her Contract with <HI>Arnaldo,</HI> they ranne all to ki&s;&s;e her hand, pro|nouncing her (after the Dutche&s;&s;e) for their Lady; and di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves in every parti|cular, to follow my directions. Hereupon, I lo&s;t no time, but de&s;iring &s;ome of them to &s;tay in that hou&s;e, till the contrived De&s;ign had taken effect, I thus continued to &s;peak to them.</P>
<P><Q>My Lords: This is my de&s;ign; And he that hath any better way, let him &s;peak, and procure the publick and private benefit of his Country, of his Prince, and of him&s;elf. You &s;hall, if you plea&s;e, take a rude &s;upper with me, to &s;tay hid till my de&s;igns be ripe, to lead you el&s;ewhere. In the interim, I will &s;end <HI>Euri|damas</HI> to intreat the Counte&s;&s;e to &s;up to night with my wife, de&s;iring to impart &s;ome matters of concernment to her, out of the noi&s;e of the Palace. I am confident &s;he will come pre&s;ently, out of a de&s;ire to get &s;ome Pre&s;ent out of us, having an opinion, that we are exceeding rich in Jewells. When &s;he comes, we will &s;ecure her attendants, and re|turn with her and <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> to the Palace;
<PB N="184" REF="102">of the which having made our &s;elves Ma&s;ters, with the impri&s;onment (if he will not freely &s;urrender him&s;elf) of the Count Governour, we will proceed with his Orders and Signalls, to &s;ei&s;e the Market-place, and the Port, without noi&s;e or blood. And this I a&s;&s;ure you, my Lords, on the word of a Gentleman, (which is the onely recompence of merit, which myperills and coun&s;ells may acquire me) that there &s;hall not be &s;pilt the blood of any Sub|ject, although a Rebell; nor of any Stran|ger, although an Enemy; except it be in our nece&s;&s;ary defence. I onely &s;hall ask, that the Count and Counte&s;&s;e Governours, may be left to my protection, to whom beeing other|wayes obliged, and drawing the Counte&s;&s;e to my hou&s;e, I de&s;ire and entreat the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> to ingage, that &s;he will never here|after on any occa&s;ion, or under any pretence, puni&s;h them for this default of the Rebellion of the Count of <HI>Lythar</HI> their brother.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus &s;aid, and having received from the Prince&s;&s;e and Lords, their Word and Oath; and having left them in an unob&s;erved place of the hou&s;e, I immediately di&s;patcht <HI>Eurida|mas</HI> to invite the Counte&s;&s;e to Supper; who failed not to come a while after, with a very &s;lender retinue. We &s;upt rea&s;onable well; and fora&s;much as being di&s;compo&s;ed with the plots in my head, I was ever and anon &s;ilent and pen&s;ive, and &s;ometimes beholding her with much attention, &s;he entred into a &s;u&s;pition of me, as if I contemplated her out of a liking of her beauty; and began to ob&s;erve my face, and
<PB N="185" REF="102">behaviour, and remained a little &s;u&s;pended and changed. But &s;upper was hardly done, when I was informed by <HI>Methrodorus</HI> and <HI>Euri|damas,</HI> that they had, in a pretence to entertain them, carryed the Attendants of the Counte&s;&s;e into a place whence they could not &s;tir, and that the Confederated Lords were in a po&s;ture ready to march to the Palace. I &s;tarted up, and, with a countenance between merry and &s;eri|ous; Gentle Madam (&s;aid I) <Q>It &s;en&s;ibly agrieves me, to &s;tain the mirth of the Table of ho&s;pitality, with a nece&s;&s;itated incivility towards you; but becau&s;e I am more obli|ged to <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> your Prince&s;&s;e, and my La|dy, than to the courte&s;ies received from your urbanity, I be&s;eech you pardon the errour, that, with rea&s;on, I commit again&s;t Rea&s;on. Madam, you are my pri&s;oner, and all that I can comply in to your Merits, and my Obli|gations is, to a&s;&s;ure you, in the name of this your Prince&s;&s;e, and my Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, your life, honour, and e&s;tate. Be plea&s;ed therefore to change your title of Governe&s;&s;e of <HI>Calcides,</HI> into that of a Subject and Servant of <HI>Doricinia</HI> and <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> and to remain in my cu&s;to|dy, not &s;tirring a &s;tep from me; for if you &s;tir, and receive &s;ome affront, I have di&s;|charged my &s;elf, having already &s;atisfied the debts of Friend&s;hip and Honour, not onely in advi&s;ing you, but in pre&s;erving all that <HI>which you ought in ju&s;tice to lo&s;e, as of cour&s;e, with your Husband, guilty of a High trea&s;on, impardo|nable upon any other account,</HI> unle&s;&s;e that of the unparallel'd <HI>Clemency</HI> of this generous Prince&s;&s;e.</Q></P>
<PB N="186" REF="103">
<P>That the Counte&s;&s;e remain'd a&s;toni&s;hed with &s;uch a change of Scenes in the Theater of For|tune, que&s;tionle&s;&s;e is not to be doubted; She would at fir&s;t have &s;hewed her re&s;ent|ments, and have cryed out to her &s;ervants; but &s;eeing the confederate Lords to enter the room armed at all poynts, &s;he now reque&s;ted, what I had formerly voluntarily proffered, to pre|&s;erve her honour, e&s;tate; and life. Then I lead her, and <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> into her own Coach, and made &s;ome of the Lord's &s;ervants, to put on the Liveries of her Pages, and Lacquyes, who had already rallyed a great number of friends and Complices, going in this po&s;ture qui|etly, till we came to the Palace; giving her in the mean time, particular information of <HI>Ar|go&s;thenia,</HI> and of that affaire; that &s;he might Cancell her former crimes, by her pre&s;ent good &s;ervice, co-operating (her&s;elf) to the <HI>&s;etle|ment of the State, in reducing it to the obedi|ence of it's legitimate Governours.</HI> The Coun|te&s;&s;e (as &s;he &s;aid, being obliged with &s;uch mode&s;ty and courteous treatment,) offered her &s;elf to do miracles in this particular, &s;eeing no &s;ini|&s;ter adventure of Fortune ob&s;tructed her.</P>
<P>Being brought with &s;uch like di&s;cour&s;e to the Palace, and having deluded the guards, by fir&s;t dividing them by her order, and then they being made to di&s;-arm by the Servants of the Lords, we a&s;cended to the uper appartements (po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our &s;elves of all the po&s;ts as we went) and into her own Chamber, where her Husband was expecting her to go to bed.</P>
<P>But, &s;eeing me appear with her, and <HI>Argo|&s;thenia,
<PB N="187" REF="103">Methrodorus, Euridamas,</HI> and the other Lords, in no peaceable po&s;ture, he would have cried out, and have called his Gentlemen and Guards to help him.</P>
<P><Q>Then the Counte&s;&s;e, &s;tepping out before the re&s;t, &s;aid, My Lord, you al&s;o mu&s;t acknowledge <HI>Argo&s;thenia</HI> for your Prince&s;&s;e and Lady, and put your &s;elf, as I have done, under the prote|ction of this Knight, or re&s;olve to die pre&s;ent|ly without any remi&s;&s;ion. <HI>The&s;e u&s;urped Gran|dures, as unfit for us, are &s;oon vani&s;hed:</HI> It re|mains that we &s;ubmit with patience and fide|lity, thereby to de&s;erve the favours we have already obtained of pardon for our Crimes; with the &s;afety of our lives, riches, and ho|nours.</Q> Surrender therefore to this Lady, who is your Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> your preten&s;ions of Command, and the Signals for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Port and Fleet. She is Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, and you are no longer Governour of <HI>Calcides.</HI></P>
<P>He being in part &s;atisfied with the&s;e Remon|&s;trances of the Counte&s;&s;e, the ab&s;olute con|trouler of his heart, and regulator of his affe|ctions, did all that we de&s;ired: and we in&s;tant|ly committed the charge to the Lords our Con|federates, recommending to <HI>Euridamas</HI> the Guard of the Palace to <HI>Methrodorus</HI> that of the <HI>Piazza,</HI> or Market-place; to the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Armenum</HI> the inve&s;ting of the Port, to the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Lagia</HI> of the Fleet, and to other Lords and Knights other Charges, according to their merits and capa|cities. There were likewi&s;e called to the Palace the old &s;ervants of the Dutche&s;&s;e, which had &s;tay'd at <HI>Calcides;</HI> but I my &s;elf &s;tirr'd not from
<PB N="188" REF="104">the Prince&s;&s;e's &s;ide, not to confound the orders, which depended on my direction, and to look to the per&s;ons of the Count and Counte&s;&s;e, and get out of them &s;uch things as were nece&s;&s;ary to be known for the regulating my actions in the pre&s;ent conjunctures.</P>
<P>The night being thus &s;pent without &s;leep, the morning following, all that va&s;t Citie beheld it &s;elf recovered out of the hands of the Rebels, without the lo&s;&s;e of any man, except one onely Captain, and a few Souldiers of a <HI>Corps du guard:</HI> which would have refu&s;ed obedience to the Count of <HI>Armenum.</HI> Day being come, all the Nobility and Citizens repaired to the Pa|lace to do Homage to <HI>Argo&s;thenia,</HI> and to de|mand the death of the Governour and his fol|lowers, for an expiation of that Rebellion. And &s;eeing the old Coun&s;ellours of the Dutche&s;&s;e, and the other Mini&s;ters of State advi&s;ed that they &s;hould be delivered, notwith&s;tanding the Prin|ce&s;&s;e's Oath, that &s;o the people might not be de|nied that &s;atisfaction, which might be a means to make them the more re&s;olute in defending them&s;elves again&s;t the Count of <HI>Lytharre,</HI> when he &s;hould march thither with his Army to re|venge them; and being unwilling that my faith &s;hould be broken, I carried the Count and Counte&s;&s;e with the Prince&s;&s;e's permi&s;&s;ion &s;ecret|ly to my hou&s;e, and there di&s;gui&s;ing them in Lacquyes apparel, got them &s;afe out of <HI>Calci|des.</HI> Then afterwards leaving the Prince&s;&s;e's in|&s;tructions in writing for the perfecting the de|&s;ign of the work begun, and bidding <HI>Adieu</HI> to the Cavaliers, my friends, I got <HI>incognit&ograve;</HI> a|board
