<HEAD>SOME Con&s;iderations: Humbly Offered to Demon&s;trate <HI>How prejudicial it would be to the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Plantations, Reve|nues of the Crown, the Navigation and general Good of this Kingdom, that the &s;ole Trade for Negroes &s;hould be granted to a Company with a Joynt-Stock exclu&s;ive to all others.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe great and un&s;peakable Advantage the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Planta|tions are to <HI>England,</HI> is &s;o well known, that it needs no de|mon&s;tration to prove it. The only thing Nece&s;&s;ary, is to endeavour to improve and increa&s;e this mighty advantage|ous Trade, by &s;ecuring them from the In&s;ults of their Enemies, and enabling them to make larger quantities of the Commodities of tho&s;e Colonies.</P>
<P>Now the means mo&s;t conducive thereunto will be to make the Trade to <HI>Affrica</HI> open and free for all the Native Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> which Trade for Slaves is chiefly from <HI>Acra</HI> to <HI>Angola,</HI> and contains a|bout 1200 Miles Sea-co&s;t, in which extent the pre&s;ent <HI>Affrican</HI> Com|pany have neither Fort, Ca&s;tle, nor Factory; &s;o that they have not the lea&s;t colour for a Pretence to an exclu&s;ive Right of Trade into tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the Riches of the Plantations con&s;i&s;ts in Slaves chiefly, by who&s;e &s;trength and labour all their Commodities, as To|bacco, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, Ginger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are produced; and the more Slaves tho&s;e Plantations are &s;upplyed with, the more Commodities are made, and the &s;tronger they are to defend them&s;elves again&s;t any In|&s;ults. Neither can there be any more danger of being over-&s;tockt with Negroes, than there is that too much Tobacco, Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent to <HI>England;</HI> for it is a plain con&s;equence, the more Negroes the more Goods will be produced, the more Goods the more Cu&s;tom paid, and all tho&s;e Commodities rendered here at home &s;o cheap as will enable this Nation to &s;end them abroad cheap al&s;o, to the great di&s;couraging of the Plantation-Trade of all other Nations. Wherefore it is very plain, that a large &s;upply of Negroes will not only bring great Riches to this Kingdom, but will al&s;o greatly Increa&s;e our Navigation.</P>
<P>Whereas on the contrary, &s;hould the <HI>Affrican</HI> Trade be inclo&s;ed, and confin'd to the Wills and Powers of a Company, the con&s;equence would prove as fatal to the Plantations as a Power given to one Per&s;on in <HI>Eng|land</HI> to &s;upply the Gardners with Servants, and the Farmers and Carriers
<PB N="2" REF="2">with Hor&s;es: It is not to be doubted that the one would be con&s;train|ed to pay yearly for his Servants as much as his Years product would amount to, and the other for his Team as much as the Rent of his Farm, which would prove great Di&s;couragements to their Labour and Indu&s;try. This may we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e would be the Ca&s;e of the Planters in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> were there but one Per&s;on that mu&s;t &s;up|ply them with Slaves, they being &s;o extreamly Nece&s;&s;ary, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to live without them, every Man being rich or poor according to his Stock in Slaves. A Man that may be Proprietor of 10000 Acres of Land, would &s;till be poor had he no &s;tock of Negroes to employ upon it.</P>
<P>It might be fairly Objected, That the pre&s;ent <HI>Affrican</HI> Company have carryed on their Trade but very imperfectly as to their own Advantage, (notwith&s;tanding that was all the De&s;ign they aimed at) as may be plainly proved from the Care they have taken to &s;upply all the Plantati|tions, it being very well known that they have not for the&s;e 20 Years or more &s;ent one Ships-loading of Negroes to <HI>Virginia</HI> nor <HI>Maryland,</HI> which are two very large Countreys, and capable of making twice as much To|bacco as they now do, were they but well &s;upplyed with Negroes.</P>
<P>Every Negro that is &s;ent into tho&s;e Plantations, makes as much To|bacco yearly as pays from 30 <HI>l.</HI> to 40 <HI>l.</HI> Sterl. Cu&s;tom, but the Compa|ny think that is not material to their Stock: They under&s;tand the Peo|ple are generally poor, and therefore will not venture to tru&s;t them; whereas at the &s;ame time private Men have, (tho' with the hazard of being &s;eized by the Companies Agents) and had it not been for that Supply tho&s;e Countries had been in a much wor&s;e Condition than at pre&s;ent they are.</P>
<P>To further demon&s;trate what before is hinted at, that the Company have no Forts, Ca&s;tles nor Factories from <HI>Acra</HI> to <HI>Angola,</HI> nor do they &s;uppo&s;e them nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the Slave-Trade, is plainly proved from their own Practice and Management of that Trade, for when they de&s;ign a Ship to trade for Slaves, they put a Lee-ward Cargo (as they term it) on board the Ship, and give the Ma&s;ter or the chief Officer of the Ship full power to di&s;po&s;e, barter and &s;ell the &s;aid Cargo for their Accounts, allowing them a Commi&s;&s;ion of 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for di&s;po|&s;ing of the &s;aid Cargo, taking on board the Negroes, and delivering them to their Factors in the Plantations, who have u&s;ually been the Gover|nours of tho&s;e Places, who have di&s;po&s;ed of the Negroes not always to the poor Planters liking, but nece&s;&s;ity hath no law, &s;o mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Will and Plea&s;ure of their Superiours.</P>
<P>Now this great and growing Evil can only be prevented by permitting more Sellers of Negroes than one, wherefore &s;ince it is evidently demon|&s;trable, that it is no charge to carry on and manage the Slave-Trade, and of what great Concern it is to encourage and &s;upport the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plan+tations, whereby the Navigation of the Kingdom, Revennues of the Crown, and the General Good of this Nation is &s;o much advanced, there|fore it is humbly hoped that the Trade from <HI>Acra</HI> to <HI>Angola</HI> inclu&s;ive may be henceforth judged and allowed to be free and open for all the Subjects of this Kingdom.</P>
