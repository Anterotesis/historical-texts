<HEAD>Die Veneris, <HI>14</HI> Julii, <HI>1648.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT cannot be unknowne to all men that the Commerce and Navigation of this Kingdom hath been by the ble&s;&s;ing of God an e&s;peciall meanes of the honour and greatne&s;&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and that the courage, indu&s;try, and fidelity of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sea|men and Marriners hath been a princi|pall meanes of the increa&s;e of the Trade and Commerce of this Kingdome in all the parts of the world; the con&s;ideration whereof have cau&s;ed both Hou&s;es of Par|liament to have an e&s;peciall care unto the Royall Navie, by building many Ships and Frigats, and &s;etting forth and main|taining
<PB N="2" REF="3">Fleets, expending in that &s;ervice the whole revenue of the Cu&s;tomes, (the greate&s;t part whereof in former times was diverted unto other u&s;es) be&s;ides other va&s;t &s;ummes of Money laid out in that action.</P>
<P>And for the better incouragement of &s;uch Marriners as were imployed in the &s;ervier of the State, they have much ad|vanced their pay above that which it was formerly, and at the comming in of the Fleets have &s;o carefully provided for them, that they were never di&s;charged from on Board out of Victualls and wa|ges, untill their Moneys were duly paid them, hoping that by the&s;e and many o|ther incouragements upon all occa&s;ions they would have approved them&s;elves faithfull to the Kingdome in the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; but contrary hereunto, the Mariners of &s;everall of the Royall &s;hips &s;et forth in this la&s;t Summers Fleet, being by the cunning in&s;inuation of men ill affected to the Peace of this
<PB N="3" REF="3">Kingdome &s;educed, have rreacherou&s;ly revolted from their duty, and doe &s;till per|&s;i&s;t in their di&s;obedience, by which hor|rid and dete&s;table act in breach of their tru&s;t, they have much blemi&s;hed the ho|nour and credit of the Navigation, and Mariners of this Kingdome, and as much as in them lies, betrayed the publique in|tere&s;t and liberties thereof, and retarded tho&s;e ends of a happy Peace, which the Parliament have ever pur&s;ued, and now are more e&s;pecially imployed in; and al|though both Hou&s;es of Parliament have (after an Act of Indempnity already of|fered) good rea&s;on for to proceed in the reducing of them by force, yet to the end it may appeare that the Parliament doe as much as in them lies, &s;eeke to prevent the effu&s;ion of blood, The &s;aid Lords and Commons doe hereby Offer and Declare; That if the Seamen, Officers and Commanders on Board the &s;aid Ships &s;hall within twenty dayes after publication hereof, or forthwith up|on
<PB N="4" REF="4">notice given them by the Lord Admirall, or &s;uch other Per&s;on or Per|&s;ons as he &s;hall appoint, render them|&s;elves, and the Ships, wherein they are to the Parliaments obedience, and bring them into &s;ome Port under the command of the Parliament, the per&s;ons &s;o &s;ubmitting &s;hall be indempnified in their per&s;ons and e&s;tates, any former act of theirs notwith&s;tanding; but if they &s;hall after the &s;aid time prefixed expired per&s;i&s;t &s;till in their di&s;obedience, then the Hou&s;es will proceed to the reducing of them by force, and doubting not of a good &s;ucce&s;&s;e by the ble&s;&s;ing of Almigh|ty God, hoping that every true-hearted Engli&s;h man will contribute his utter|mo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to this worke, e&s;pecially the Merchants and Owner of Ships, they being principally Intere&s;&s;ed in the con|&s;equences thereof, it being to be expect|ed that the Revolters will endeavour to maintaine their defection by rapine and violence, and for the Incouragement of
<PB N="5" REF="4">Seamen, to ingage them&s;elves herein, The Lords and Commons doe promi&s;e and declare, that &s;uch Seamen as &s;hall &s;o ingage and u&s;e their be&s;t indeavors in this &s;o honourable a worke &s;hall have two moneths wages extraordinary duly paid them, as &s;oone as the &s;aid Ships &s;hall be by them reduced and brought into Port&punc;</P>
<P>And it is la&s;tly Declared, that not on|ly the per&s;ons on board the &s;aid Ships, who &s;hall notwith&s;tanding this offer of Indempnity &s;tand out, but al&s;o all other the Subjects of this Kingdome, and o|thers what&s;oever, who &s;hall hereafter joyne with, a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;upply, or any way adhere to them, &s;hall be dealt with and proceeded again&s;t as Traitors and Ene|mies to the Kingdome, and their E&s;tates confi&s;cate; and for the mi&s;eries that &s;hall en&s;ue, they will &s;tand charged with the &s;ame as guilty of them, and authors of that ruine which will attend them and their po&s;terity.</P>
