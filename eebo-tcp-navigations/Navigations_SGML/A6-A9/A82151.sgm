<P>_SInce our fir&s;t dayes Engagement with the enemy, it hath plea&s;ed the great Omni&s;ciency of Hea|ven &s;till to crown every days Action with a more glorious Victory; and, truly, very opportunely came in his Excellency Gen. Blake to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who charged quite through the enemies fleet, on Friday, and made &s;uch an intervale among&s;t their men of war, that many were &s;een to &s;ink before &s;ix in the evening: The di&s;pute was very hot, and performed with great gallantry from ten in the morning til ten at night, by which time, We had taken 1350 pri&s;oners,
<PB N="4" REF="3">whereof &s;ix Captains, 11 &s;hips, &s;unk &s;ix, and fired three; but in all the &s;everal En|gagements we have &s;unk taken, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d burnt about 40, among&s;t the re&s;t, the great Ad|miral of Holland, called he Brederode, in which was Vantrump, but he narrowly e|&s;caped out at one of the Port holes in a Cock-Boat. VVe have taken down the Dutch Colours both from the Admiral, and the two Rear admirals, and have &s;et up the Engli&s;h En&s;ignes, with the States armes.</P>
<P>We have di&s;pierced th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir great Armado, and beaten them into their own Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bours, having al|la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um'd the whole Countrey, &s;o that we hear mo&s;t of the Boors are up in armes.</P>
<P>The States have Ordered that all the Maritine Towns be re-inforced with &s;undry companies out of the old &s;tanding Regiments, that &s;o they may thereby prevent the landing of the Engli&s;h. They have al&s;o ordered that the &s;everal Sluces be forth|with put in a readine&s;s, for the letting in of the &s;eas, if nece&s;&s;itated thereunto.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>We hear likewi&s;e that the States have &s;et forth a Declaration to be publi&s;hed throughout all the U|nited Provinces, inciting the Burgoma&s;ters, and o|thers, to a general Convention at the Hague, there to con&s;ult upon a way, for a Reconciliation be|tween the two Republicks. O what is more wi&s;hed or would be more welcome then peace? What is better or &s;weeter then peace? what is more &s;plen|did and beautiful then peace? Peace is that fair <HI>A&s;traea</HI> that linketh men tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther in the golden fet|ters of mutuall Amity, and maketh them to live as if their per&s;ons being many, their &s;oules were but one.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving per&s;ued the enemy even to their own Coa&s;t upon Friday night, we rode at anchor at &s;ix fatham Water, di|vers of the Dutch rode between 3 and 4, &amp; on Saturday morning expected to have put into harbour; but the Winds were &s;o cro&s;s, that We were all forced to &s;tand off to &s;ea, and on the Sabbath day about 6 in the morning, We Weather-gaged them, and came up again, letting fly above 1000 &s;hot at each other; in which di&s;pute, We fired one, and &s;unk five; but not without &s;ome lo&s;s; for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a Conflict &s;hould b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> managed with that feli|city, as for the Conquerors to e&s;cape with|out
<PB N="7" REF="4">any head being broken. About 8 in the evening they bare up before the Wind for the Ta&s;&s;el; but could not get in, for Vice-Admiral Pen, with 30 gallant frigats inter|po&s;ed, and &s;o got between them and home. But night approaching, the di&s;pute ended, and the next morning early They tacked about, and thought to have e&s;caped; which General Blake perceiving, immediatly came up to them again; &s;o that another de&s;perate fight began, and for many houres it was furiou&s;ly di&s;puted; but about three in the afternoon, it plea&s;ed God to make us ab&s;o|lute Victors, and to deliver into our hands, many hundreds of the enemy; the re&s;t that e&s;caped are mi&s;erably rent and torn, &s;ome flying towards O&s;tend. Others, towards the Wielings, and not 12 left in a compa|ny. In the la&s;t dayes engagement we &s;unk, &s;even, and took as many. We laid one of
<PB N="8" REF="5">their Admirals aboard five times, and at la&s;t carryed her.</P>
<P>The death of General Dean is much lamented, he was &s;hot with a Canon-bullet, at the very fir&s;t broad &s;ide given by the enemy, as he &s;tood flou|ri&s;hing his Sword at the head of his &s;hip, having his Arm taken off by the &s;hot, and his body exceed|ingly rent and torn.</P>
<P>VVe are now riding upon the Dutch coa&s;t, and have &s;ent many hundred &s;hot into the Town of Flu&s;hing, and Vice-Admiral Pen &s;till lies at the mouth of the Texel.</P>
