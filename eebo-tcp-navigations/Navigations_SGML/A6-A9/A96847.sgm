<P>IT is an Ob&s;ervation in &s;acred Scripture, <HI>That tho&s;e that go down to the Sea in &s;hips &s;ee the wonders of the Lord in the deep;</HI> which was fully made good in this miraculous deliverance, that we are here to relate; which happened but the very la&s;t month in our own Seas, and to per&s;ons of our own Nation.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd Week of the month of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el called the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Dorothy,</HI> fell down out of the River intending to &s;teer along the Coa&s;ts to <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> haveing on board of Seamen and Pa&s;&s;engers about five and twen|ty per&s;ons; They &s;ail'd with a fair wind and good weather till they came off of <HI>Flamborough-Head</HI> (a &s;mall Promontory in <HI>York&s;hire</HI>) where being &s;urprized with a &s;torm, they were driven out to Sea, and the rough

<P>It would be ea&s;ie here to draw Tears from every compa&s;sionate Readers eyes by a pathetical di&s;cripti|on of the&s;e poor forlorn Wretches condition, but in|deed Words are too little to expre&s;s it to the Life, and we mu&s;t leave it to his imagination to draw a true <HI>Idea</HI> of their mi&s;ery, which none can fully do, but &s;uch as are &s;en&s;ible by experience of the torment|ing effects of Famine, and a pro&s;pect of Inevitable Death continually before their eyes, and have them|&s;elves born a &s;hare in &s;ome &s;uch like grievous calami|ty. It may &s;ound like a Romantick action, but it is a mo&s;t &s;erious and well known Truth that they con|tinued driving forwards and backwards as the wind &s;hifted its points, in this manner for the &s;pace of eight days longer. And it cannot be denyed, that nothing but the &s;pecial and extraordinary provi|dence of Heaven could have &s;o long pre&s;erved them, that they were not overturn'd by the Winds, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">allowed up by the Waves, or da&s;h'd to pieces
<PB N="5" REF="3">again&s;t Rocks, or at lea&s;t that they were not ut|terly pined and fami&s;hed for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ood is next to a miracle if we may not truly count it one: but that over-ruling power that &s;tills the rageing of the Sea, and bounds it at his plea&s;ure, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to hear their cry, to &s;upport langui&s;hing nature even again&s;t hope, and calm the Ocean for their &s;afety.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch that after eight days fluctuation they were ca&s;t upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> and driven a&s;hore on the I&s;le, where the inhabitants &s;eeing &s;o &s;mall a Boat come off from Sea, with per&s;ons in it, concluding them to be the remnants of &s;ome wrack, charitably went down to receive them; they were all exceeding weak, not able at fir&s;t to &s;peak or go; but being taken in by the people, and put into warm Beds, and &s;upplyed with Cordials to re&s;tore their &s;pirits, they in &s;hort time recovered, and related all the particulars of their di&s;tre&s;s in manner afore|&s;aid; and from thence after &s;ome &s;pace of refre&s;hing were carried in a &s;hip to <HI>Harlingen,</HI> and &s;o came to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where the young man continues, but the three women took the opportunity of a Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Scotland,</HI> to go thither, being of that Nation; and the old man came over to <HI>England</HI> in the Pacquet-Boat; and does with much thank&s;giving relate Gods Wonderful Mercy in this great and miraculous deli|verance.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>As for the re&s;t of their &s;hips crew, which were ta|ken up before by the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Caper, they were &s;et on &s;hore in <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire,</HI> and divers of them were &s;eve|ral days ago arrived at <HI>London,</HI> confidently reporting the&s;e five per&s;ons to have been ca&s;t away, as they had all the rea&s;on in the world to imagine, till the &s;ight of the old man convinced them of that mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Thus may we from this certain Relation take oc|ca&s;ion to magnifie the Lord for his mercies, and learn to put all our tru&s;t in the Arm of his might, when &s;urrounded with the greate&s;t &s;traights and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; when Art is baffled, and nature finks, and the &s;pirits faint, and hope it &s;elf di&s;pairs, then can he command relief and deliverance. Oh! who would not tru&s;t in &s;o great a God? who would not love and adore &s;o good a God?</P>
