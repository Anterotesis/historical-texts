<HEAD>A Letter from PLIMOVTH Touching The good Succe&s;&s;e of Generall <HI>Blake,</HI> and Sir <HI>George A&s;cues</HI> taking of &s;everall Merchants &s;hips and others, from the HOLLANDERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ON Wedne&s;day the 8th. of this pre&s;ent <HI>September</HI> 1652. Generall <HI>Blake</HI> with the Parliaments great fleet pa&s;&s;ed by within &s;ight of this place.</P>
<P>A Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent in from him to Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue,</HI> who with his fleet was then at anchor in this Roade, To de&s;ire him to weigh Anchor, and come out &s;peedily to him with his fleet.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> then pre&s;ently &s;ent out Orders to all the &s;hips, and they all &s;ailed out, according to the Orders &s;ent in by Gen. <HI>Blake.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;alutation of the Fleets, Sir <HI>Geo. Ay&s;|eue</HI> went aboard the Admirall to the Gene|rall, where a Councell of Officers pre&s;ently met, and re&s;olved to &s;aile We&s;tward to|wards the Holland Fleet, or where they &s;hould di&s;cover them to be.</P>
<P>That night in the evening they &s;et all &s;ail We&s;tward, the &s;ea&s;on being very good, faire weather that day and the next, and the wind good.</P>
<P>But &s;ince that, we have had &s;ome boy|&s;terous winds, which have been very high, but I doe not heare of any great lo&s;&s;e, or harme (ble&s;&s;ed be God) that we have &s;u&s;tai|ned by it.</P>
<P>The Lord hath been plea&s;ed to give &s;ome good &s;ucce&s;&s;es to our Fleet &s;ince they went out from hence.</P>
<P>For Generall <HI>Blake</HI> hath &s;ent out &s;qua|drons of &s;hips which have taken from the
<PB N="3" REF="3">Hollanders twenty &s;aile of Ships, whereof one Man of Warre, one Pickeroon, and the re&s;t Merchants &s;hips.</P>
<P>The Merchants Ships are laden with wine, Strong-waters, vinegar, &s;alt, and o|ther merchandizes to &s;ome value.</P>
<P>Seven of the&s;e &s;hips are already come in|to Plimouth, and orders &s;ent for di&s;po&s;all of them, with directions and in&s;tructions, the re&s;t being thirteen, when the&s;e came a|way from the Fleet, they were ordering to be di&s;po&s;ed of, they are &s;peedily to be &s;ent into &s;ome Port.</P>
<P>The Dutch-men in the Man of warre &s;eeme to be but &s;orry Sea-men, and it was not extraordinary well manned; they &s;peake of great di&s;tractions in Holland, and Zeland, but chiefly in Holland, the Zeland Sea-men are very famous.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day la&s;t Generall <HI>Blake</HI> had a di&s;covery of the Holland Fleet, which are thought to be about a hundred &s;aile, and Generall <HI>Blake,</HI> now with Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue,</HI> both joyned, are neare an hundred &s;aile, I
<PB N="4" REF="4">thinke of the-be&s;t Ships, and the gallante&s;t Fleet in the world.</P>
<P>The Holland Fleet were then di&s;cove|red to be about &s;ome twelve Leagues off from Scilly.</P>
<P>Hereupo, this di&s;covery being made, a Councell of VVarre was called, to con&s;ult what to doe.</P>
<P>And it was re&s;olved with a great union and magnanimity, that they &s;hould pre|&s;ently &s;aile towards them, and endea|vour if po&s;&s;ibly to engage them.</P>
<P>And accordingly our whole Fleet &s;ailed towards the Hollanders great Fleet, and are in pur&s;uit of them.</P>
<P>We doe ob&s;erve, that the Hollanders doe much vapour, and make &s;hewes, and boa&s;tings where they come, at a di&s;tance from us, and they finde them&s;elves able to deale with &s;ome &s;maller party then them|&s;elves, but when any con&s;iderable Party, any wayes able to deale with them come neare them, then they &s;aile away.</P>
<P>And they are mo&s;t often &s;een, and appear
<PB N="5" REF="4">in view towards the evening, that &s;o in the night they may &s;link away out of &s;ight, we cannot tell where.</P>
<P>Were not the Hollanders puft up in pride and hardne&s;&s;e of heart like <HI>Pharoah</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> they would not goe on in their ob&s;tinacy as they doe.</P>
<Q><HI>But though hand joyn in hand the wicked &s;hall not goe unpuni&s;hed.</HI></Q>
