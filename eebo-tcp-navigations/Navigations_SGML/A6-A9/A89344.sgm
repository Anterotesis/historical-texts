<P>Little addition there is to what your &s;elf had done in the time of your Government, only what vitious Excre&s;cencies had grown in the body of them, by the corrupt humor of the times, we have throughly purg'd them of, that we might not any where leave unrazed the memory of our enforc'd Defection from his Sacred Maje&s;ty; for whom, your prudent care &s;o long pre&s;erved the Countrey, both from the ruine we were almo&s;t brought to by that de&s;perate Warr with <HI>Opechankevogh,</HI> who&s;e Conque&s;t (had not the Cloudine&s;s of tho&s;e times ob&s;cured the glory of it) could not have lo&s;t the e&s;teem of being one of the mo&s;t important Services, that, perhaps, had been rendred in many years before to the Crown.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="4"> thing hapning at any time &s;ince any Law was in force; and have al&s;o endeavoured in all things, as near as the capacity and con|&s;titution of this Countrey would admit, to adhere to tho&s;e Excellent, and often refined Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to which we profe&s;s and ac|knowledge all Reverence and Obedience; and that the Laws, made by us, are intended by us but as brief Memorials of that, which the capacity of our Courts is utterly unable to Collect out of its va&s;t Volumns, though &s;ometimes perhaps, for the difference of our and their Condition, varying in &s;mall things, but far from the pre&s;um|ption of contradicting any thing therein contained.

<P>WHereas the mutual Di&s;contents, Complaints, Jealou&s;ies and Fears of Engli&s;h and <HI>Indians,</HI> proceed chiefly from the vio|lent Intru&s;ions of divers Engli&s;h made into their Lands, forcing the <HI>In|dians,</HI> by way of Revenge, to kill the Cattel and Hogs of the Engli&s;h; and by that means Injuries being done on both &s;ides, Reports and Ru|mours are &s;pread of the Ho&s;tile Intentions of each to others, tend|ing infinitely to the di&s;turbance of the Peace of His Maje&s;tie's Coun|try: And whereas the Laws prohibiting the Purcha&s;e of any <HI>Indi|an</HI>'s Lands (unle&s;s acknowledged at <HI>General Courts</HI> or A&s;&s;emblies; by rea&s;on it is as ea&s;ie to affright them to a publick, as well as a pri|vate acknowledgement) are made fruitle&s;s, and ineffectuall; cor|rupt Interpreters often adding to this mi&s;chief, by rendring them willing to &s;urrender, when indeed, they intended to have received a Confirmation of their own Rights, and a Redre&s;s of their wrongs; which mi&s;chiefs had they continued, mu&s;t needs have involved the Country into an inevitable and de&s;tructive Warr. For Remedy of which Inconveniences, and that, for the future, a &s;ure equitable peace may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Governour, Council, and Burge&s;&s;es out of their tender care of Ju&s;tice and the Peace of this His Maje&s;tie's Country, have enacted, ordained, and confirmed, and do by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, enact, ordain, and confirm, That, for the future,</P>

<P>And be it further enacted, That what Engli&s;hman hath already contrary to the Laws formerly in force, for &s;urrendring and acknow|ledging <HI>Indian</HI>'s Lands, made Incroachments, or &s;eated upon them, &s;hall, if they make not good proof of their Title, upon Complaint made, be, by Order directed to the Sheriff to execute, removed
