<HEAD>THE HOLLANDERS <HI>Emba&s;&s;age to</HI> ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_LET no Roman Catho|like look or ca&s;t a view upon the&s;e lines, le&s;t he find him&s;elf more &s;hook, than one trou|bled with a Tertian Ague: for he &s;hall find here no comfort, but many cro&s;&s;es, no Pope wor&s;hipped, but in the Highway to be confoun|ded. No trea&s;on broaching, but traytors &s;et on tilt, all Popi&s;h dregs being ca&s;t forth for the di|vell to feed upon. No Peace proclaimed to the Babyloni&s;h Whore, but a bloody warre; no Comedie but a Tragedie. Performed not alone by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but al&s;o by true and noble &s;pi|rited <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who&s;e love to <HI>England</HI> hath, and is daily expre&s;&s;ed, which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> is able
<PB REF="3">to witne&s;&s;e; but not delight to heare of, in regard that their plate hath &s;o often &s;upplyed the Hol|landers coffers, in &s;pite of Spains proude&s;t Dons or Romes malicious cur&s;es, who are able to do as much harme as their ble&s;sings good.</P>
<P>O what a heart-aching to them was that hap|py Marriage; of our High-born Prince&s;&s;e the Lady <HI>Marie</HI> to that worthy Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> &s;ure it was as pre|judiciall unto them, as their overthrow in eigh|tie, eight: but it is ours and <HI>Hollands</HI> joy, who&s;e loyaltie late proffered for the good both of our King and Country, I thus relate.</P>
<P>The newes being arrived in <HI>Holland,</HI> of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Irelands</HI> calamity, they, the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> were very much grieved, as if that they had been partakers of the others mi&s;erie.</P>
<P>And truly, &s;o it doth behove each well-affe|cted Chri&s;tian, who is ambitious of nothing, but to embrace true Pietie, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and ayd his friend being in adver&s;itie.</P>
<P>The heathen Queen <HI>Dido</HI> having been once in trouble her &s;elf, did the rather give ear to the Trojan Prince <HI>Aeneas</HI> his misfortunes, &s;aying thus;
<Q>&mdash; <HI>Mi&s;eris &s;uccurrere di&s;co.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having been in trouble my &s;elf, I learn now to &s;uccour tho&s;e which are troubled.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P> And yet there are a &s;ort of people in the world, which are friends to none but tho&s;e which are in pro&s;peritie, which <HI>Ovid</HI> having had experience of, writ thus;
<Q><L><HI>Donec &s;aelix multos numerabis amicos,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tempora &s;i fuerint nubila, &s;olus eris.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>As long as a man is happie, that is, worldly rich, he &s;hall be &s;ure to want no friends: but his pro&s;peritie being eclip&s;ed with clouds of ad|ver&s;itie, then his former &s;ycophanrs will an&s;wer him, with a truely I have forgot you.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> prove them&s;elves to be of another Nature, making this loving proffer.</P>
<P>That if they might have priviledge to fight upon his Maje&s;ties Seas, there &s;hould neither pa&s;&s;e by them, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> fleet, to do either the Prote&s;tants of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> any harm.</P>
<P>Thus they proffered not when the Prote|&s;tants of <HI>Ireland</HI> were in pro&s;peritie, but now being in adver&s;itie, which is true friend&s;hip in|deed, and now to make their proffer good, they have proceeded to action.</P>
<P>Thirtie of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> men of warre &s;cou|ted up and down the Seas toward <HI>Dunkirk,</HI>
<PB REF="4">becau&s;e it was reported in <HI>Holland,</HI> that a Navie was di&s;patching from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to aid the Rebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Who&s;e Navie the&s;e Hollanders with their pro&s;pective gla&s;&s;es di&s;covered, and pre&s;ently di&s;|patched their packet-boat unto Sir <HI>Iohn Pen|nington,</HI> Vice-Admirall of his Maje&s;ties Seas, to know whether they &s;hould &s;et vpon them or not, who having no Commi&s;sion from the King or Parliament, gave them no An&s;wer pre&s;ently, but fir&s;t &s;ent Letters to know whether their pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be &s;topt or no, who&s;e An&s;wer was, that it &s;hould.</P>
<P>Then to the &s;ame effect did Sir <HI>Iohn Penning|ton</HI> an&s;wer the Hollanders Me&s;&s;enger, of which they were as joyfull as the birds of the Spring, &s;ayling bravely towards them, to the great a|mazement of the Dunkirk Navie.</P>
<P>Who &s;tood upon their guard as well as they could, but the Hollanders made &s;uch havocke a|mong&s;t them, at length they had little courage to go to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Rebels in Ireland, having &s;o much to do at home, the fight la&s;ted above forty eight houres, many of the &s;hips which be|longed to Dunkirk were taken, and many &s;unk, to the eternall honour of the Hollanders, but di&s;grace of them&s;elves: thus doth God revenge their cau&s;e which put their tru&s;t in him.</P>

<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>UNto your Honorable Hou&s;e, that we are truly &s;en|&s;ible of your great care, and extraordinary endea|vours, to &s;ettle our Religion, and Peace, and daily give thanks to God Almighty for it; And we do further in all humility pre&s;ent to your Honourable con&s;idera|ions, which wee do apprehend a great &s;top in Refor|mation of matters of Religion, and our &s;elves together with you, and the whole Kingdome, to be in great dan|ger of the Papi&s;ts, and other ill-affected per&s;ons, who are every where very infolent, and are ready to act the parts of tho&s;e cruell blood-&s;uckers in <HI>Ireland,</HI> if they be not &s;peedily prevented: by means whereof our Tra|ding, e&s;pecially of Clothing, and Farming, grew a great pace, to &s;o great a damp, as many thou&s;ands are like to come to &s;uddain want. Nor can we expect any redre&s;&s;e therof, unle&s;&s;e the Bi&s;hops and Popi&s;h Lords be remo|ved out of the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>Therefore wee humbly pray, that you would ear|ne&s;tly mediate His Maje&s;ty and the Hou&s;e of Peers,
<PB REF="5">That our Brethren in <HI>Ireland</HI> may &s;peedily be relieved, and the Papi&s;ts throughout the Kingdome be di&s;ar|med, and that &s;uch defects of Arms, as in your di&s;creti|ons, &s;hall appeare to be meet, may be &s;upplyed, and this County and Kingdom, put into &s;uch a Warlike po&s;ture, as may be be&s;t for its defence, and &s;afety, and that the Bi&s;hops, and Popi&s;h Lords who as wee conceive, have hindered the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of your Godly Endeavours, may be put out of the Hou&s;e of Peeres: Not doubting but then our Petition formerly pre&s;ented to your Hou&s;e, will receive a more full and &s;peedy An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>And your Petitioners re&s;olving in all ju&s;t and honourable wayes, according to the late Prote&s;tation, to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, with our lives, and E&s;tates, again&s;t the Enemie of God, the King, and State, humbly pray to Almighty God, for your good &s;ucce&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
